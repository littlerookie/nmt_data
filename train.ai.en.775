Mm!
Oh, baby, you were awesome.
no. - Listen to me, awesome.
okay.
uh, John, this is... this is my boyfriend, Sack.
Hey, fella. - How you doing?
listen, we've gotta go meet the Schreibers.
okay, was great to meet you. Thank you!
boom, I gotcha!
Oh, great! Good to see you.
I've been looking all over for you. I gotta get outta here pronto, - I've got a Stage Five clinger. - No no, I need more time.
did you hear what I just said to you?
stage 5? Virgin? Clinger? Let's go, I'm gonna start the car.
I'm serious, let's go.
I don't think that you're appreciating the urgency here.
not only is she a virgin, she's totally off the reservation.
I'm terrified of this broad.
here you are! - Hey! Gloria, wow!
this is John Ryan. - Oh, hi.
Yeah. - So my family and a few friends, we're all going back to our little place on the shore and it would be - so great if you guys came. - Really?
sounds sort of wonderful. - I am...
well it does, it sounds... it sounds very nice.
but-but and I'm flattered that you would even think of me to include me in something like that, Gloria. Thank you.
it kills me however to have to tell you I'm sorry, I just... timing's no good.
I won't be able to make it. - Why?
it's gonna be so much fun! - It's gonna be so much fun!
I'm sure it will be fun for the... for the people that are going.
I-I unfortunately can't go. I-I don't have, um...
I only have this monkey suit.
I don't have any clothes. - No, we have everything you need.
problem solved. Problem solved! - The problem's not solved.
the problem's not solved. - Deal us in.
Oh, cool cool cool! I'm gonna run and find my dad! Ah!
Hey, don't ask your dad! Don't ask your dad! Don't...
the train's going. We gotta get on. - That's true. Why don't... why don't you - just feed me to the lions? - What?
step on my head when I'm drowning. - What?
what a great friend. What do you mean, what?
John, this is completely against the rules.
there's no overtime. No! - Oh, no overtime?
what about the Chang wedding three years ago?
Oh, that's bullshit. - Yeah, thought I forgot about that.
2: 00 A. M. you dragged me 50 miles to watch you and some chick play mah-jong with her grandmother at a retirement home.
Yeah, completely different situation.
how? - What do you mean how?
she was a very very family-oriented girl.
and she was very into her grandmother. They're very family-oriented.
give me a break! - That was my first Asian!
you better lock it up. - You better lock it up.
no, you lock it up. Lock it up. - You lock it up. Lock it up.
please! It would mean so much to me, please!
look at the way he's looking at me.
I can tell he doesn't like me, John. He's the Secretary of the Treasury.
and to be honest with you, my taxes aren't exactly in line.
Oh, come on, you're being paranoid.
he's threatened by the way I dance.
damn it! Why'd I have to go showin' off like that?
now I'm all over his radar. Stupid!
you're not that good a dancer.
Oh, please!
you and I both know I'm a phenomenal dancer.
now I know you're lying through your teeth!
you'll do anything to get me to go on this thing, even if I have to walk right into the lion's den.
Gloria, come on!
you know I'm not gonna give in to this kind of behavior.
she's like a kid at Toys R Us. I can't be around it.
Oh, get off your high horse. Stop judging people.
you take off the white wig, and you stop judging me.
I don't want to be around someone who's a nut job.
I need some alone time with her. - If you want to hang out with Claire, the boyfriend and Cybill, by all means. I'm not going.
let me lay it out for you in simple chapter and verse: You're going.
let me break it down for you so you understand: I'll hold your hand like - a small child. I'm not going. - Yes, you are.
you can go if you want. I'm... no, I'm not. No, I'm not.
you're gonna be a team player for once in your life.
he'd love you to come. - Yes! Yes! Baba ganoush!
what do I do? - Baba ganou!
okay okay. Home sweet home.
you okay? - Yeah.
come here, come here.
are you okay? Because I'm gonna need 100%/% of Jeremy this weekend and you're looking a little weird.
she took me below deck for 45 minutes. I don't have - any bodily fluids left in me. - Gentlemen, everything okay?
great! Yep. - Great?
you know, we were thinking about a little game of touch football, - you know. - Yeah?
cleary family tradition. - A little pigskin, why not?
great. - Don't forget to stretch, guys.
we're gonna be on the field in 10.
clothes fit. - Ooh.
I'm not even gonna say it, but you... you-you know I'm upset.
I know you are. I think you look good.
you know I don't look good.
Hey, honey!
I'm over here!
are you ready? Are you ready for some football?
ready! Set! Hut! Hut! Hike!
one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi.
Yes! - Ooh!
Whoo! - Yes! Crab cakes and football!
that's what Maryland does! - Nice one!
a little out of shape? - Yeah.
way to bring it! - Way to anticipate that rush, man.
no, I just saw you had it. - Hey, shut up!
you gotta anticipate that rush.
cool, no, of course I do. - You did a great job.
what happened, Toast? - I think he's on steroids.
it was like trying to cover a fuckin' racehorse.
well, don't worry about it. - Get it up!
we'll burn 'em with the post.
no no. No, I got a better idea.
look, I want you to fake the post, throw an interception to Claire, get her to feel good, you know?
gets them foamy. You think you can do that?
John, I was first team, all-state. I can put the ball wherever I want to.
I'll make it rain out here. All right, guys, bring it in. Blue 17!
blue 17! Red 17!
Oh, you're gonna cover me? - Like white on rice.
all right, I like my odds here. I'm gonna give you a little warning, - I'm going downtown. - Hot route!
red seven, red seven, red seven!
look for me in the endzone after this play, I'll be the guy holding the ball.
John! Red seven! - What? I don't know what "red seven" means. - Hot route!
I don't... w-what is "hot route"?
will you just go stand on the other side, please?
are you runnin' away from me?
No! I'm just gettin' over here. - You scared?
down! - Come on!
ready, down, set! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
go, Jeremy!
Hey, yo! Hit me! Hit me!
Boo-ya!
that's what we call a sack lunch!
Num-num-num-num-num-num!
Ow! Bird.
big tree fall hard, right?
how many fingers I got up? Come on, Pepe, how many fingers I got up?
Oh, come on, I got four. Okay, here's five.
man down! We got a man down!
you okay?
Hey, is your brother okay?
what? Aw, he's fine.
I can't breathe.
what's that? - I can't breathe.
no no no, I think he's really hurt.
well, serves him right after that throw.
Hey! Baba ganoush!
I don't know... I don't know what got into me, Secretary, I just...
I do. Five generations of Lodge family breeding.
your father used to pull... - I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
the same stunt when we were your age. - I can't breathe.
is that right? - You okay?
great! You threw it perfectly!
come on, get up!
don't oversell it. - I'm not selling anything.
come on, stop milking it. You make us look like a bunch of pussies.
Jeremy! Sit this play out.
Todd, come on in.
you must be joking.
it wouldn't kill you to play some competitive sports once in a while, would it?
well, would that make you love me?
pfft. Jesus.
Hey, Jeremy, red moon dog 7-11!
42, 30-teen!
hut one! Hut two!
blitz!
Jeremy!
Hoo-ah!
Oh!
Oh. - That looked like it hurt.
I got you! - No, you didn't!
you're cheating! Oh my God. - You're cheating!
the only... - Your brother, he's down again.
what is his deal?
l... I don't know what's getting into me today, guys. It's just...
nature versus nurture, Lodge. Nature always wins.
what are you doing? It's a game of touch.
every time I look over, you're on your ass again.
if I had any air in my lungs, I'd scream at you!
Oh, now you're gonna blame me?
cause you're not athletic enough to stay on your two feet?
I hate you.
let's take a daiquiri time-out.
daiquiris.
Oh!
sweetheart, why don't you take him into the house and fix him up?
sure, Mom. - Oh, don't baby him, - it just makes it worse. - Oh! My back hurts.
Oh, great. Game's over. Satisfied?
you got everyone on you now? Get all the attention.
it's hot out here. - Yeah, it is.
you should have played in your underwear.
I'll get you a drink.
Oh, Jesus Christ. It burns.
Oh! Poor baby. - It stings. Oh, Jesus.
you want me to blow on it?
no. No no no. No no no.
no, I don't need any blowing. I'm good, I'm good.
I'm... thank you. - Jeremy, I'm not wearing any panties.
Oh. Yeah. - That's right.
Ooh, ah, oh! - Um, uh, okay. That's fun. That's nice.
uh, yeah, that's fun, yeah.
that's fun. Okay, Gloria, could you just stop for...
that's funny, that's funny, - that's funny. - Ahem.
don't you worry, Miss Gloria.
mum's the word. - Thank you, Randolph.
a little more discreet, though, okay?
Jesus Christ.
don't worry, he won't say anything.
okay, I'm a little confused.
just like eight hours ago you were a shy little virgin, and now you're not wearing any panties.
I'm just trying to catch up with you here. - You do that to me. Ooh.
Where's my little friend? - I do what... no no no.
Where's my little friend? - He's tired. He's tired.
Where's my little friend? - He's in time-out.
he's in time-out. Gloria, please! I'm exhausted.
I'm exhausted. I've had a very long day.
dry hump me up and down the field all afternoon.
my leg's cut and bleeding. I'm just... I'm not really in the mood for this.
Ow! Jesus Christ!
my father warned me about people like you, Jeremy.
I'm just another notch on your belt!
Wha... this is not like that. What are you talk... it's not like that!
Really?! Then what's it like, Jeremy, huh?
Ow! Ow! No! Wait! Wait! - Huh?!
it's just that I'm feeling very strongly that we're only starting to express ourselves in a physical, sexual-specifically way.
that's it! Wait!
and I'd like to play some catch-up on finding out who's inside here.
okay?
Jeremy.
Jeremy, you're amazing! - Oh God, I think you're amazing.
Oh my God, don't ever leave me. - Ever.
good! 'Cause I'd find you.
Yeah.
of course like all kids, I had imaginary friends, but not just one.
I had hundreds and hundreds and all of them from different backgrounds who spoke different languages. And one of them, whose name was Caleb, he spoke a magical language that only I could understand.
get him all patched up?
I sure did, Daddy.
Gloria bug.
you go change for dinner.
okay.
you know, she's not just another notch on the old belt.
I don't even wear a belt. Beltless.
I'm a very powerful man.
Yes, you are.
see you for dinner.
so, I am President of the Environment Defense League.
and I pick up this little sea otter...
...and... and... and... wipe off the oil from the tanker spill.
all right, you gotta step this up already. I'm gonna give you - the damn eyedrops. - No, I don't want 'em.
it's too hardcore. - Well, do you want to be alone - with her or not? - Yes.
put a few of these in his drink and he'll be going down on toilet seat - for the next 24 hours. - I don't want to do it.
I can beat this guy. Let's be honorable for once.
and the whiskers.
and the oil's... the oil's flapping, he goes...
give me the eyedrops. - Thank you.
perfect.
let us bow our heads in prayer.
heavenly Father, we thank You for Thy bounty on this table and ask that You bless the entire Cleary family and all the friends here assembled.
Amen. - Amen.
Mm. Oh, these scallops look fantastic. - I, uh... I bought them from an organic scallop farm right off the coast of, uh, Nattachoke.
actually, Sack got the Governor to subsidize part of the project.
and now it's the state's only self-sustaining scallop farm.
say that five times, fast. You can't do it. Self-sustaining...
they actually look terrific. Maybe I'll actually try some when I get the sensation back in my face - from the, uh... football game. - Again, Jeremy, I'm sorry.
I just, you know, I have this damn competitive streak.
um... I'm seeing a Buddhist about it.
not just any Buddhist. His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. He's a good friend.
stop traffic. Because when I go back to town, I'm actually gonna see an orthopedist about what you did to my back. And not just any orthopedist.
I'm gonna see a Dr. Epstein who specializes in...
Hey, Sack, how long have you and Claire been seeing each other?
Claire and I? Um, what's it been, sweetheart? A couple years?
three and a half.
Yeah, um, actually, we started dating while we were doing - Habitat for Humanity. - Sure.
pretty soon... we'll be getting married.
Yep.
well, not too soon, um...
we still have a lot of things that we want to accomplish.
anyway, once Claire and Sack tie the knot, two of the great American families, the Clearys and the Lodges, - will finally unite. - Hear, hear.
and then of course, you can challenge the Klingons for interstellar domination, right?
Jeremy...
I saw you on the dance floor.
you move pretty good.
Oh. Thanks a lot.
l... really just got lucky.
I was more in the zone than anything else.
it was the booze dancing.
sorry guys, I forgot.
how are you guys connected to the family again?
uncle Ned's kids.
you know... Uncle Ned?
aunt Liz's brother. Ned and Liz.
hmm. No, I don't know.
so, Jeremy, you and your brother are venture capitalists.
that's right. - That's great.
venture capitalist. The backbone of the system.
it's the new pioneer. - New pioneer.
so is it just about the money?
no no, it's about, investing in companies that are ethically and morally defensible.
well, like what? Give me an example.
like what? Well, there's the company that we have where we're taking the the fur or the wool from sheep and we turn it into thread for homeless people to sew.
and then they make it into cloth, which they in turn sew then, um...make some shirts and pants for other homeless people to sell. It's a pretty good deal.
people... people helping people. - Yeah.
that's... that's very admirable.
thank you. Although, don't make me out to be a saint just yet.
we do turn a small profit.
after all, someone has to pay for the, uh, lap dances for the big guy here.
Oh!
he's joking around. It feels so good when he jokes.
what's this, uh, company called?
holy sh... - Shirts & Pants. Holy Shirts & Pants.
it's a little corny and obvious, but what do you get out of being subtle, right?
well, that's a hell of a good project.
I'm gonna mention something to the Commerce Secretary.
that would be terrific. That would be great, huh?
terrific, it was terrific.
isn't my Willy doing a wonderful job there in Washington?
mommy. - You know, Willy's father, my husband was the Secretary of State for President Franklin Roosevelt.
that must have been so thrilling... FDR.
my gosh, FDR was a wonderful President.
he was a doll.
the wife, though, Eleanor...
big dyke! - Oh Lord.
huge dyke! A real rug muncher!
looked like a big lesbian mule.
grandma, you can't talk like that, okay? It's not right.
somebody... somebody get me another Scotch for Christ sakes!
I think I'm gonna go to bed.
honey, are you okay?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine. You know, I'm just a little tired. Thanks.
okay. - You all right?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
what an athlete. A tremendous competitor.
I know.
Todd, I noticed that you haven't even touched your food yet.
I don't eat meat or fish. - He's a homo.
mommy, let's not go there again.
actually, um, Todd is an amazing painter.
he's going to the Rhode Island School of Design.
Oh, that's a great school. Congratulations, Todd.
that's really impressive, Rizdee.
Yeah, Dad... Dad used to think I'd be a political liability, you know, in case he ever ran for President.
now, Todd! Actually, truth be told, polling shows a majority of the American people would ultimately empathize with our situation.
what is our situation, Dad?! - You're a homo.
Oh, for God sakes, William, put Mommy to bed already.
okay. Mommy, we've had a long day.
I can do it myself, asshole.
Wow.
I'll be in my room painting.
Homo things.
you just go right ahead, Toddy.
Mmm, wonderful scallops. - Absolutely. Wonderful.
you know, um...
I think I'm gonna get some air.
Oh, I'll get some air if you want some company.
sure. - Let me just change my shoes.
excuse me. - All right. I'm gonna... can't walk away from the delicious food that we got here.
I just had my tits done.
in the beginning, the Word already existed.
the Word was with God...
and the Word was God.
from the very beginning, the Word was with God.
through him God made all things.
not one thing in all creation was made without him.
the Word was the source of life...
and this life brought light to people.
the light shines in the darkness...
and the darkness has never put it out.
God sent his messenger...
a man named John...
who came to tell people about the light...
so that all should hear the message and believe.
he himself was not the light. He came to tell about the light.
this was the real light...
the light that comes into the world and shines on all people.
the Word was in the world...
and though God made the world through him...
yet the world did not recognize him.
he came to his own country...
but his own people did not receive him.
some, however, did receive him and believed in him...
so he gave them the right to become God's children.
they did not become God's children by natural means...
that is, by being born as the children of a human father.
God himself...
was their father.
the Word became a human being...
and full of grace and truth, lived among us.
we saw his glory...
the glory which he received as the Father's only Son.
John spoke about him.
this is the one I was talking about when I said:
'he comes after me...
'but he is greater than I am...
'because he existed before I was born! "
out of the fullness of his grace, he has blessed us all...
giving us one blessing after another.
God gave the Law through Moses...
but grace and truth...
came through Jesus Christ.
no one has ever seen God.
the only Son, who is the same as God...
and is at the Father's side...
he has made him known.
the Jewish authorities in Jerusalem sent some priests and Levites to John.
who are you?
John did not refuse to answer, but spoke out openly and clearly.
I am not the Messiah. -Who are you then?
are you Elijah? -No, I'm not.
are you the Prophet? -No.
then tell us who you are.
we have to take an answer back to those who sent us.
what do you say about yourself?
John answered by quoting the prophet, Isaiah.
'I am the voice of someone shouting in the desert:
"make a straight path for the Lord to travel!"
the messengers, who had been sent by the Pharisees, then asked John:
if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet...
why do you baptize?
I baptize with water.
but among you stands the one you do not know.
he is coming after me.
but I am not good enough...
even to untie his sandals.
all this happened in Bethany, on the east side of the Jordan River...
where John was baptizing.
the next day, John saw Jesus coming to him.
there is the Lamb of God...
who takes away the sin of the world.
this is the one I was talking about when I said:
'a man is coming after me...
'but he is greater than I am, because he existed before I was born. "
I did not know who he would be.
but I came baptizing with water...
in order to make him known to the people of Israel.
and John gave this testimony:
I saw the Spirit come down, like a dove from heaven, and stay on him.
I still did not know that he was the one. But God...
who sent me to baptize with water, had said to me:
'you will see the Spirit come down and stay on a man.
'he is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. "
I have seen it, and I tell you...
that he is the Son of God.
the next day, John was standing there again with two of his disciples...
when he saw Jesus walking by.
there is the Lamb of God.
the two disciples heard him say this...
and went with Jesus.
Jesus turned, saw them following him.
what are you looking for?
where do you live, Rabbi?
this word means " teacher. "
come and see.
it was then about 4.00 in the afternoon...
so they went with him and saw where he lived...
and spent the rest of that day with him.
one of them was Andrew...
Simon Peter's brother.
at once, he found his brother Simon.
we have found the Messiah.
this word means " Christ. "
come.
then he took Simon to Jesus.
Jesus looked at him.
your name is Simon, son of John...
but you will be called Cephas.
this is the same as Peter, and means " a rock. "
the next day, Jesus decided to go to Galilee.
he found Philip...
and said to him.
come with me.
philip was from Bethsaida, the town where Andrew and Peter lived.
philip found Nathanael.
we have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the Book of the Law...
and whom the prophets also wrote about.
he is Jesus, son of Joseph, from Nazareth.
can anything good come from Nazareth? -Come and see.
when Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, he said about him:
'here is a real Israelite. "
there is nothing false in him.
how do you know me?
I saw you when you were under the fig tree before Philip called you.
teacher...
you are the Son of God.
you are the King of Israel.
do you believe just because I told you I saw you when you were under the fig tree?
you will see much greater things than this.
I am telling you the truth.
you will see heaven open...
and God's angels going up and coming down on the Son of Man.
two days later, there was a wedding in the town of Cana in Galilee.
Jesus' mother was there...
and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.
when the wine had given out...
Jesus' mother said to him, " They are out of wine. "
madam...
what do you have to do with this?
my time has not yet come.
do whatever he tells you.
the Jews have rules about ritual washing...
and for this purpose, six stone water jars were there...
each one large enough to hold between 20 and 30 gallons.
fill these jars with water.
they filled them to the brim.
now draw some water out, and take it to the man in charge of the feast.
they took him the water, which now had turned into wine...
and he tasted it.
he did not know where this wine had come from...
but, of course, the servants who had drawn out the water knew.
so he called the bridegroom.
everyone else serves the best wine first, and after the guests have drunk a lot...
he serves the ordinary wine. But you have kept the best wine until now.
Jesus performed this first miracle in Cana in Galilee.
there he revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.
after this, Jesus and his mother, brothers, and disciples...
went to Capernaum and stayed there a few days.
it was almost time for the Passover Festival, so Jesus went to Jerusalem.
there, in the Temple...
he found people selling cattle, sheep and pigeons...
and also the moneychangers sitting at their tables.
so he made a whip from cords and drove all the animals out of the Temple...
both the sheep and the cattle.
he overturned the tables of the moneychangers...
and scattered their coins.
and he ordered those who sold pigeons:
take them out of here!
stop making my Father's house a marketplace!
his disciples remembered that the scripture says:
'my devotion to your house, O God, burns in me like a fire. "
the Jewish authorities came back at him with a question:
what miracle can you perform to show us that you have the right to do this?
tear down this temple, and in three days I will build it again.
are you going to build it again in three days?
it has taken 46 years to build this temple.
but the temple Jesus was speaking about...
was his body.
so when he was raised from death...
his disciples remembered that he had said this...
and they believed the scripture, and what Jesus had said.
while Jesus was in Jerusalem during the Passover Festival...
many believed in him as they saw the miracles he performed.
but Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew them all.
there was no need for anyone to tell him about them...
because he himself knew what was in their hearts.
there was a Jewish leader named Nicodemus...
who belonged to the party of the Pharisees.
one night, he went to Jesus.
rabbi, we know...
that you are a teacher sent by God.
no one could perform the miracles you are doing, unless God were with him.
I am telling you the truth.
no one can see the kingdom of God...
without being born again.
how can a grown man be born again?
he certainly cannot enter his mother's womb and be born a second time.
I am telling you the truth.
no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit.
a person is born physically of human parents...
but is born spiritually of the Spirit.
do not be surprised because I tell you that you must all be born again.
the wind blows wherever it wishes.
you hear the sound it makes...
but you do not know where it comes from, or where it is going.
it is like that with everyone who is born of the Spirit.
how can this be?
you are a great teacher in Israel...
and you don't know this?
I am telling you the truth.
we speak of what we know, and report what we have seen.
yet none of you is willing to accept our message.
you do not believe me when I tell you about the things of this world.
how will you ever believe me, then, when I tell you about the things of heaven?
and no one has ever gone up to heaven...
except the Son of Man, who came down from heaven.
as Moses lifted up the bronze snake on a pole in the desert...
in the same way, the Son of Man must be lifted up...
so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.
for God loved the world so much that He gave his only Son...
so that everyone who believes in him may not die, but have eternal life.
for God did not send his Son into the world to be its judge, but to be its savior.
those who believe in the Son are not judged.
but those who do not believe have already been judged...
because they have not believed in God's only Son.
this is how the judgment works:
the light has come into the world...
but people love the darkness rather than the light...
because their deeds are evil.
those who do evil things hate the light and will not come to the light...
because they do not want their evil deed to be shown up.
but those who do what is true come to the light...
in order that the light may show that what they did was in obedience to God.
after this, Jesus and his disciples went to the province of Judaea...
where he spent some time with them, and baptized.
John also was baptizing in Aenon...
not far from Salim...
because there was plenty of water in that place.
people were going to him, and he was baptizing them.
this was before John had been put in prison.
some of John's disciples began arguing with a Jew...
about the matter of ritual washing.
teacher...
you remember the man who was with you on the east side of Jordan...
the one you spoke about?
he is baptizing now, and everyone's going to him.
no one can have anything unless God gives it.
you yourselves are my witnesses, that I said:
'I am not the Messiah, but I have been sent ahead of him. "
the bridegroom is the one to whom the bride belongs.
but the bridegroom's friend...
who stands by and listens, is glad when he hears the bridegroom's voice.
this is how my own happiness is made complete.
he must become more important while I become less important.
he who comes from above is greater than all.
he who is from the earth belongs to the earth...
and speaks about earthly matters...
but he who comes from heaven is above all.
he tells what he has seen and heard...
yet no one accepts his message.
but whoever accepts his message...
confirms by this that God is truthful.
the one whom God has sent speaks God's words...
because God gives him the fullness of his Spirit.
the Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his power.
whoever believes in the Son has eternal life.
whoever disobeys the Son will not have life...
but will remain under God's punishment.
the Pharisees heard that Jesus was winning and baptizing more disciples than John.
actually, Jesus himself did not baptize anyone. Only his disciples did.
so when Jesus heard what was being said...
he left Judea and went back to Galilee.
on his way there, he had to go through Samaria.
in Samaria, he came to a town named Sychar...
which was not far from the field that Jacob had given to his son, Joseph.
jacob's well was there...
and Jesus, tired out by the trip...
sat down by the well.
it was about noon.
a Samaritan woman came to draw some water.
give me a drink of water.
his disciples had gone into town to buy food.
you're a Jew, and I'm a Samaritan.
so how can you ask me for a drink?
jews will not use the same cups and bowls that Samaritans use.
if you only knew what God gives...
and who it is that is asking you for a drink, you would ask him...
and he would give you life-giving water.
sir, you don't have a bucket, and the well is deep.
where would you get that life-giving water?
it was our ancestor Jacob who gave us this well.
he and his children and his flocks all drank from it.
you don't claim to be greater than Jacob, do you?
those who drink this water will get thirsty again...
but those who drink the water that I give them will never be thirsty again.
the water that I will give them will become, in them, a spring...
which will provide them with life-giving water, and give them eternal life.
sir, give me that water. Then I will never be thirsty again...
nor will I have to come here to draw water.
go and call your husband, and come back.
I don't have a husband.
you're right when you say you don't have a husband.
you've been married to five men...
and the man you live with now is not really your husband.
you've told me the truth.
I see you are a prophet, sir.
my Samaritan ancestors worshipped God on this mountain...
but you Jews say that Jerusalem is the place where we should worship God.
believe me, woman...
a time will come when people won't worship the Father either on this mountain...
or in Jerusalem.
you Samaritans do not really know whom you worship.
but we Jews know whom we worship...
because it is from the Jews that salvation comes.
but the time is coming...
and is already here...
when, by the power of God's Spirit...
people will worship the Father as he really is...
offering him the true worship that he wants.
God is Spirit.
and only by the power of his Spirit...
can people worship him as he really is.
I know that the Messiah will come.
and when he comes, he will tell us everything.
I am he.
I, who am talking with you.
at that moment, Jesus' disciples returned...
and they were greatly surprised to find him talking with a woman.
but none of them said to her, "What do you want?"
or asked him, "Why are you talking with her?"
then the woman left her water jar and went back to the town.
come and see the man who told me everything I have ever done.
could he be the Messiah?
so they left the town, and went to Jesus.
in the meantime, the disciples were begging Jesus:
'Teacher, have something to eat! " But he answered:
I have food to eat that you know nothing about.
so the disciples started asking among themselves.
'could somebody have brought him food? "
my food is to obey the will of the one who sent me...
and to finish the work he gave me to do.
you have a saying, " Four more months, and then the harvest. "
but I tell you, take a good look at the fields.
the crops are now ripe and ready to be harvested.
the one who reaps the harvest is being paid and gathers the crops for eternal life.
so the one who plants and the one who reaps will be glad together.
for the saying is true. Someone plants, someone else reaps.
I have sent you to reap a harvest in a field where you did not work.
others worked there...
and you profit from their work.
many of the Samaritans in that town believed in Jesus...
because the woman had said, " He told me everything I have ever done. "
so when the Samaritans came to him...
they begged him to stay with them...
and Jesus stayed there two days.
many more believed because of his message, and they told the woman.
'we believe now, not because of what you said...
'but because we ourselves have heard him...
'and we know that he really is the Savior of the world. "
after spending two days there...
Jesus left, and went to Galilee.
for he himself had said:
'Prophets are not respected in their own country. "
when he arrived in Galilee, the people there welcomed him...
because they had gone to the Passover Festival in Jerusalem...
and had seen everything that he had done during the festival.
then Jesus went back to Cana in Galilee...
where he had turned the water into wine.
a government official was there, whose son was sick in Capernaum.
when he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee...
he went to him...
and asked him to go to Capernaum...
and heal his son, who was about to die.
none of you will ever believe unless you see miracles and wonders.
sir, come with me...
before my child dies.
go.
your son will live.
the man believed Jesus' words and went.
on his way home, his servants met him with the news.
your boy is going to live!
he asked them what time it was when his son got better.
it was 1: 00 yesterday afternoon when the fever left him!
then the father remembered that it was at that very hour when Jesus had told him:
your son will live.
so he and all his family believed.
this was the second miracle...
that Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.
after this, Jesus went to Jerusalem for a religious festival.
near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem, there is a pool with five porches.
in Hebrew, it is called Bethzatha.
a large crowd of sick people were lying on the porches...
the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed.
a man was there who had been sick for 38 years.
Jesus saw him lying there...
and he knew that the man had been sick for such a long time.
do you want to get well?
sir, I don't have anyone here to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up.
while I'm trying to get in, someone else gets there first.
get up.
pick up your mat and walk.
immediately, the man got well.
he picked up his mat...
and started walking.
the day this happened was a Sabbath...
so the Jewish authorities told the man who had been healed:
this is a Sabbath, and it is against our law for you to carry your mat.
the man who made me well told me to pick up my mat and walk.
who is the man who told you to do this?
but the man who had been healed did not know who Jesus was...
for there was a crowd in that place, and Jesus had slipped away.
afterwards, Jesus found him in the Temple.
you're well now...
so stop sinning...
or something worse may happen to you.
then the man left...
and told the Jewish authorities that it was Jesus who had healed him.
so they began to persecute Jesus...
because he had done this healing on a Sabbath.
Jesus answered them.
my Father is always working.
and I, too, must work.
this saying made the Jewish authorities all the more determined to kill him.
not only had he broken the Sabbath law...
but he had said that God was his own Father...
and, in this way, had made himself equal with God.
so Jesus answered them:
I tell you the truth!
the Son can do nothing on his own!
he does only what he sees his Father doing! What the Father does, the Son also does.
for the Father loves the Son...
and shows him all that he himself is doing.
he will show him even greater things to do than this, and you will all be amazed!
just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life...
in the same way, the Son gives life to those he wants to.
nor does the Father himself judge anyone.
he has given his Son the full right to judge...
so that all will honor the Son in the same way as they honor the Father.
whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.
I am telling you the truth!
those who hear my words and believe in him who sent me...
have eternal life.
they will not be judged, but have already passed from death to life.
I am telling you the truth.
the time is coming.
the time has already come...
when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God.
and those who hear it will come to life.
just as the Father is, himself, the source of life...
in the same way, he has made his Son to be the source of life.
and he has given the Son the right to judge, because he is...
the Son of Man!
do not be surprised at this.
the time is coming when all the dead will hear his voice and come out of their graves.
those who have done good will rise and live.
and those who have done evil.
will rise and be condemned.
I can do nothing on my own authority!
I judge only as God tells me, so my judgment is right...
because I am not trying to do what I want, but only what he who sent me wants!
if I testify on my own behalf...
what I say is not to be accepted as real proof.
but there is someone else who testifies on my behalf.
and I know that what he says about me is true.
John is the one to whom you sent your messengers.
and he spoke on behalf of the truth. It is not that I must have a human witness...
I say this only in order that you may be saved!
John was like a lamp, burning and shining...
and you were willing, for a while, to enjoy his light.
but I have a witness on my behalf...
which is even greater than the witness that John gave.
what I do...
that is, the deeds my Father gave me to do...
these speak on my behalf and show that the Father has sent me.
and the Father who sent me also testifies on my behalf.
you have never heard his voice or seen his face...
and you do not keep his message in your hearts...
for you do not believe in the one whom he sent.
you study the Scriptures, because you think that in them...
you will find eternal life! And these very scriptures speak about me!
yet you are not willing to come to me in order to have life.
I am not looking for human praise.
but I know what kind of people you are.
and I know that you have no love for God in your hearts.
I have come with my Father's authority, but you have not received me.
when, however, someone comes with his own authority, you will receive him.
you like to receive praise from one another...
but you do not try to win praise from the one who alone is God!
how, then, can you believe me?
do not think, however, that I am the one who will accuse you to my Father.
moses, in whom you have put your hope, is the very one who will accuse you.
if you had really believed Moses, you would've believed me...
because he wrote about me.
but since you do not believe what he wrote, how can you believe what I say?
after this, Jesus went across Lake Galilee...
or Lake Tiberias, as it is also called.
a large crowd followed him...
because they had seen his miracles of healing the sick.
Jesus went up a hill and sat down with his disciples.
the time for the Passover Festival was near.
Jesus looked around and saw that a large crowd was coming to him.
where can we buy enough food to feed all these people?
he said this to test Philip.
actually, he already knew what he would do.
for everyone to have even a little...
it would take more than 200 silver coins to buy enough bread.
another one of his disciples, Andrew, who was Simon Peter's brother, said:
there is a boy here who has five loaves of barley bread and two fish.
but they will certainly not be enough for all these people.
make the people sit down.
there was a lot of grass there...
so all the people sat down.
there were about 5, 000 men.
Jesus took the bread...
gave thanks to God...
and distributed it to the people who were sitting there.
he did the same with the fish...
and they all had as much as they wanted.
when they were all full, he said to his disciples.
gather the pieces left over.
let us not waste a bit.
so they gathered them all and filled 12 baskets...
with the pieces left over from the five barley loaves which the people had eaten.
seeing this miracle that Jesus had performed, the people there said:
'surely this is the Prophet...
'who was to come into the wold! "
Jesus knew that they were about to come and seize him...
in order to make him king by force.
so he went off again to the hills by himself.
when evening came, Jesus' disciples went down to the lake...
got into a boat...
and went back across the lake towards Capernaum.
night came on, and Jesus still had not come to them.
by then a strong wind was blowing and stirring up the water.
the disciples had rowed about three or four miles...
when they saw Jesus...
walking on the water...
coming near the boat...
and they were terrified.
don't be afraid.
it is I.
then they willingly took him into the boat...
and immediately the boat reached land...
at the place they were heading for.
next day, the crowd which had stayed on the other side of the lake...
realized that there had been only one boat there.
they knew that Jesus had not gone in it with his disciples...
but that they had left without him.
other boats, which were from Tiberias, came to shore near the place...
where the crowd had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples...
they got into those boats and went to Capernaum, looking for him.
when the people found Jesus on the other side of the lake, they said to him:
'Teacher, when did you get here? "
I am telling you the truth.
you are looking for me because you ate the bread and had all you wanted...
not because you understood my miracles.
do not work for food that spoils.
instead, work for the food that lasts for eternal life.
this is the food the Son of Man will give you...
because God, the Father, has put his mark of approval on him.
what can we do in order to do what God wants us to do?
what God wants you to do is to believe in the one he sent.
what miracle will you perform so that we may see it and believe you?
what will you do?
our ancestors ate manna in the desert, just as the scripture says:
'he gave them bread from heaven to eat. "
I am telling you the truth.
what Moses gave you was not the bread from heaven.
it is my Father who gives you the real bread from heaven.
for the bread that God gives is he who comes down from heaven...
and gives life to the world.
sir, give us this bread. Give us this bread always.
I am the bread of life!
those who come to me will never be hungry.
those who believe in me will never be thirsty.
now I told you that you have seen me, but will not believe.
everyone whom my Father gives me will come to me.
I will never turn away anyone who comes to me...
because I have come down from heaven to do not my own will.
but the will of him who sent me.
and it is the will of him who sent me...
that I should not lose any of all those he has given me...
but that I should raise them all to life on the last day!
for what my Father wants...
is that all who see the Son and believe in him should have eternal life.
and I will raise them to life on the last day.
the people started grumbling about him, because he said.
'I am the bread that came down from heaven. "
this man...
is Jesus, son of Joseph, isn't he?
we know his father and mother!
how, then, does he now say he came down from heaven?
stop grumbling among yourselves!
people cannot come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them to me!
and I will raise them to life on the last day.
the prophets wrote:
'Everyone will be taught by God. "
anyone who hears the Father and learns from him comes to me.
this does not mean that anyone has seen the Father.
he who is from God is the only one who has seen the Father.
I am telling you the truth.
he who believes...
has eternal life.
I am the bread of life!
your ancestors ate manna in the desert, but they died.
but the bread that comes down from heaven is of such a kind...
that whoever eats it will not die.
I am the living bread that came down from heaven!
if you eat this bread, you will live forever!
the bread that I will give you is my flesh...
which I give so that the world may live!
this started an angry argument among them.
how can this man give us his flesh to eat?
I am telling you the truth.
if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood...
you will not have life in yourselves!
those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life...
and I will raise them to life on the last day.
for my flesh is the real food, my blood is the real drink!
those who eat my flesh and drink my blood live in me...
and I live in them.
the living Father sent me...
and because of him I live also.
in the same way, whoever eats me will live because of me.
this, then, is the bread that came down from heaven.
it is not like the bread that your ancestors ate, but then later died.
those who eat this bread...
will live forever.
Jesus said this as he taught in the synagogue in Capernaum.
many of his followers heard this and said:
'this teaching is too hard. Who can listen to it? "
without being told, Jesus knew that they were grumbling about this.
does this make you want to give up?
suppose, then...
that you should see the Son of Man go back up to the place where he was before?
what gives life is God's Spirit.
human power is of no use at all.
the words I have spoken to you bring God's life-giving Spirit.
yet some of you...
do not believe.
Jesus knew from the very beginning who were the ones that would not believe...
and which one would betray him.
this is the very reason I told you...
that no people can come to me...
unless the Father makes it possible for them to do so.
because of this, many of Jesus' followers...
turned back and would not go with him anymore.
and you...
would you also like to leave?
Lord, to whom would we go?
you have the words that give eternal life.
and now we believe and know...
that you are the Holy One...
who has come from God.
I chose the 12 of you, didn't I?
yet one of you is a devil.
he was talking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
for Judas, even though he was one of the 12 disciples...
was going to betray him.
after this, Jesus traveled in Galilee.
he did not want to travel in Judea...
because the Jewish authorities there were wanting to kill him.
the time for the Festival of Shelters was near...
so Jesus' brothers said to him:
'leave this place and go to Judea...
'so that your followers will see the things that you are doing. "
people don't hide what they're doing if they want to be well known.
since you are doing these things, let the whole world know about you.
not even his brothers believed in him.
the right time for me has not yet come.
any time is right for you.
the world cannot hate you, but it hates me...
because I keep telling it that its ways are bad.
you go on to the festival
I am not going to this festival...
because the right time has not come for me.
he said this, and then stayed on in Galilee.
after his brothers had gone to the festival, Jesus also went.
however, he did not go openly, but secretly.
the Jewish authorities were looking for him at the Festival.
'where is he? " they asked.
there was much whispering about him in the crowd.
'he is a good man, " some people said. " No, " others said...
'he fools the people. "
but no one talked about him openly...
because they were afraid of the Jewish authorities.
the Festival was nearly half over...
when Jesus went to the Temple and began teaching.
the Jewish authorities were greatly surprised.
how does this man know so much...
when he has never been to school?
what I teach is not my own teaching, but it comes from God, who sent me.
those willing to do what God wants will know...
whether what I teach comes from God, or whether I speak on my own authority.
those who speak on their own authority are trying to gain glory for themselves.
but he who wants glory for the one who sent him is honest...
and there is nothing false in him.
moses gave you the Law, didn't he?
but not one of you obeys the Law.
why are you trying to kill me?
you have a demon in you. Who is trying to kill you?
I performed one miracle, and you were all surprised.
moses ordered you to circumcise your sons...
although it was not Moses but your ancestors who started it.
and so, you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath.
if a boy is circumcised on the Sabbath so that Moses' Law is not broken...
why are you angry with me...
because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?
stop judging by external standards...
and judge by true standards.
some of the people of Jerusalem said:
'isn't this the man the authorities are trying to kill?
'look, he is talking in public, and they say nothing against him.
'can it be that they really know that he is the Messiah?
'but when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from.
'and we all know where this man comes from. "
as Jesus taught in the Temple, he said in a loud voice:
do you really know me...
and know where I am from?
I have not come on my own authority.
he who sent me, however, is truthful.
you do not know him, but I know him...
because I come from him, and he sent me.
then they tried to seize him...
but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.
but many in the crowd believed in him.
when the Messiah comes, will he perform more miracles than this man has?
the Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Jesus...
so they and the chief priests sent some guards to arrest him.
I shall be with you a little while longer...
and then I shall go away to him who sent me.
you will look for me, but you will not find me...
because you cannot go where I will be.
the Jewish authorities said among themselves:
'where is he about to go so that we shall not find him? "
will he go to the Greek cities, where our people live and teach the Greeks?
he says that we will look for him...
but will not find him...
and that we cannot go where he will be.
what does he mean?
on the last and most important day of the festival...
Jesus stood up and said in a loud voice.
whoever is thirsty should come to me, and whoever believes in me should drink.
as the scripture says:
'Streams of life-giving water will pour out from his side. "
Jesus said this about the Spirit which those who believed in him were going to receive.
at that time, the Spirit had not yet been given...
because Jesus had not been raised to glory.
some of the people in the crowd heard him say this.
this man is really the Prophet!
the Messiah will not come from Galilee!
the scripture says that the Messiah will be a descendant of King David...
and will be born in Bethlehem, the town where David lived.
so there was a division in the crowd because of Jesus.
some wanted to seize him...
but no one laid a hand on him.
when the guards went back...
the chief priests and Pharisees asked them:
why did you not bring him?
nobody has ever talked the way this man does.
did he fool you, too?
have you ever known one of the authorities or one Pharisee to believe in him?
this crowd does not know the Law of Moses.
so they are under God's curse.
one of the Pharisees there was Nicodemus, the man who had gone to see Jesus before.
according to our Law, we cannot condemn people before hearing them and finding out what they have done.
are you also from Galilee?
study the scriptures...
and you will learn that no prophet ever comes from Galilee.
then everyone went home...
but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
early the next morning, he went back to the Temple.
all the people gathered round him, and he sat down and began to teach them.
the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees...
brought in a woman who had been caught committing adultery...
and they made her stand before them all.
teacher...
this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery!
in our Law, Moses commanded...
that such a woman must be stoned to death.
now, what do you say?
they said this to trap Jesus, so that they could accuse him.
but he bent over and wrote on the ground with his finger.
as they stood there asking him questions...
he straightened up.
whichever one of you has committed no sin...
may throw the first stone at her.
then he bent over again and wrote on the ground.
when they heard this, they all left, one by one...
the older ones first.
Jesus was left alone with the woman still standing there.
he straightened up.
where are they?
is there no one left to condemn you?
no one, sir.
well, then...
I do not condemn you either.
go...
but do not sin again.
Jesus spoke to the Pharisees again.
I am the light of the world.
who follows me will have the light of life and will never walk in darkness.
now you are testifying on your own behalf!
what you say proves nothing! -No.
even though I do testify on my own behalf, what I say is true...
because I know where I came from and where I am going.
you do not know where I came from or where I'm going.
you make judgments in a purely human way.
I pass judgment on no one.
but if I were to do so, my judgment would be true...
because I am not alone in this.
the Father who sent me is with me.
it is written in your Law...
that when two witnesses agree...
what they say is true.
I testify on my own behalf...
and the Father who sent me also testifies on my behalf.
where is your " Father " ?
you know neither me nor my Father.
if you knew me, you would know my Father also.
Jesus said all this as he taught in the Temple...
in the room where the offering boxes were placed.
and no one arrested him...
because his hour had not come.
I will go away, and you will look for me...
but you will die in your sins.
you cannot go where I am going.
he says that we cannot go where he is going.
does this mean that he will kill himself?
you belong to this world here below...
but I come from above.
you are from this world, but I am not from this world.
that is why I told you that you will die in your sins.
and you will die in your sins...
if you do not believe that " I Am Who I Am. "
who are you?
what I have told you from the very beginning.
I have much to say about you...
much to condemn you for.
the one who sent me, however, is truthful...
and I tell the world only what I have heard from him.
they did not understand that Jesus was talking to them about the Father.
when you lift up the Son of Man, you will know...
that " I Am Who I Am. "
then you will know that I do nothing on my own authority...
but I say only what the Father has instructed me to say.
and he who sent me is with me.
he has not left me alone...
because I always do what pleases him.
many who heard Jesus say these things believed in him.
if you obey my teaching, you are really my disciples.
you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
we are the descendants of Abraham, and we have never been anybody's slaves.
what do you mean, then, by saying, " You will be free " ?
I am telling you the truth.
everyone who sins is a slave of sin.
a slave does not belong to a family permanently...
but a son belongs there forever.
if the Son sets you free, then you will be really free.
I know you are Abraham's descendants.
yet you are trying to kill me because you will not accept my teaching.
I talk about what my Father has shown me...
but you do what your father has told you!
our father is Abraham.
if you really were Abraham's children, you would do the same things that he did!
all I have ever done is to tell you the truth I heard from God...
yet you are trying to kill me.
abraham did nothing like this.
you are doing what your father did.
God Himself is the only Father we have...
and we are his true children.
if God really were your father...
you would love me because I came from God...
and now I am here.
I did not come on my own authority...
but He sent me!
why do you not understand what I say?
it is because you cannot bear to listen to my message.
you are the children of your father, the Devil...
and you want to follow your father's desires!
from the very beginning, he was a murderer...
and has never been on the side of truth...
because there is no truth in him!
when he tells a lie, he is only doing what is natural to him...
because he is a liar and the father of all lies!
but I tell the truth...
and that is why you do not believe me.
which one of you can prove that I am guilty of sin?
if I tell the truth, then why do you not believe me?
he who comes from God listens to God's words.
you, however, are not from God...
and that is why you will not listen.
were we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon in you?
I have no demon.
I honor my Father, but you dishonor me.
I am not seeking honor for myself.
but there is one who is seeking it, and who judges in my favor.
I am telling you the truth!
whoever obeys my teaching will never die!
now we know for sure that you have a demon.
abraham died, and the prophets died...
yet you say that whoever obeys your teaching will never die.
our father Abraham died.
you do not claim to be greater than Abraham, do you?
and the prophets also died.
who do you think you are?
if I were to honor myself, that honor would be worth nothing.
the one who honors me is my Father, the very one you say is your God!
you have never known him, but I know him.
if I were to say I do not know him...
I would be a liar like you, but I do know him, and I obey his Word.
your father Abraham rejoiced...
that he was to see the time of my coming.
he saw it and was glad.
you are not even 50 years old, and you have seen Abraham?
I am telling you the truth.
before Abraham was born...
'I am. "
stone him!
then they picked up stones to throw at him...
but Jesus hid himself and left the Temple.
as Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been born blind.
teacher...
whose sin caused him to be born blind?
was it his own, or his parents' sin?
his blindness has nothing to do with his sins or his parents' sins.
he is blind so that God's power might be seen at work in him.
as long as it is day...
we must keep on doing the work of him who sent me.
night is coming...
when no one can work.
while I am in the world...
I am the light for the world.
after he said this, Jesus spat on the ground...
and made some mud with the spittle.
he rubbed the mud on the man's eyes.
go and wash your face in the pool of Siloam.
this name means " Sent. "
so the man went, washed his face...
and came back seeing.
his neighbors, then, and the people who had seen him begging before this asked:
'isn't this the man who used to sit and beg? "
he is the one. -No, he isn't. He just looks like him.
I am the man.
how is it that you can now see?
the man called Jesus made some mud, rubbed it on my eyes...
and told me to go to Siloam and wash my face.
so I went, and as soon as I washed...
I could see.
where is he? -I don't know.
then they took to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.
the day that Jesus made the mud and cured him of his blindness was a Sabbath.
the Pharisees then asked the man again how he had received his sight.
he put some mud on my eyes...
I washed my face, and now I can see.
the man who did this cannot be from God, for he does not obey the Sabbath law.
how could a man who is a sinner perform such miracles as these?
and there was division among them.
you say he cured you of your blindness.
what do you say about him?
he is a prophet!
the Jewish authorities, however, were not willing to believe that he had been blind and could now see until they called his parents.
is this your son?
you say that he was born blind.
how is it, then, that he can now see?
we know that he is our son, and we know that he was born blind.
but we don't know how it is that he is now able to see...
nor do we know who cured him of his blindness.
ask him.
he is old enough, and he can answer for himself.
his parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish authorities who had already agreed that anyone who said he believed that Jesus was the Messiah would be expelled from the synagogue.
that is why his parents said, " He is old enough. Ask him. "
a second time, they called back the man who had been born blind.
promise before God that you will tell the truth.
we know that this man who cured you is a sinner.
I do not know if he is a sinner or not.
one thing I do know.
I was blind...
and now I see.
what did he do to you?
how did he cure you of your blindness?
I have already told you, and you would not listen.
why do you want to hear it again? Maybe you, too, would like to be his disciples?
they insulted him and said:
you are that fellow's disciple, but we are Moses' disciples!
we know that God spoke to Moses!
as for that fellow, however, we do not even know where he comes from.
what a strange thing that is.
you do not know where he comes from, but he cured me of my blindness.
we know that God does not listen to sinners.
he does listen to people who respect him and do what he wants them to do.
since the beginning of the world...
nobody has heard of anyone giving sight to a person born blind.
unless this man came from God, he would not be able to do a thing!
you were born and brought up in sin...
and you are trying to teach us?
and they expelled him from the synagogue.
when Jesus heard what had happened, he found the man.
do you believe in the Son of Man?
tell me who he is, sir, so that I can believe in him.
you have already seen him...
and he is the one who is talking with you now.
I believe, Lord.
and he knelt down before Jesus.
I came to this world to judge...
so that the blind should see...
and those who see should become blind.
some Pharisees who were there with him heard him say this and asked him.
surely you don't mean that we are blind, too?
if you were blind, then you would not be guilty.
but since you claim that you can see...
this means that you are still guilty.
I am telling you the truth!
the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate but climbs in some other way is a thief and a robber!
the man who goes in through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
the gatekeeper opens the gate for him.
the sheep hear his voice as he calls his own sheep by name...
and he leads them out. When he has brought them out...
he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
they will not follow someone else.
instead they will run away from such a person because they do not know his voice.
Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what he meant.
so Jesus said again.
I am telling you the truth. I am the gate for the sheep.
all others who came before me are thieves and robbers...
but the sheep did not listen to them.
I am the gate.
those who come in by me will be saved.
they will come in and go out and find pasture.
the thief comes only in order to steal, kill, and destroy.
I have come in order that you might have life.
life in all its fullness.
I am the good shepherd, who is willing to die for the sheep.
when the hired man, who is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep...
sees a wolf coming...
he leaves the sheep and runs away.
so the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them.
the hired man runs away because he is only a hired man...
and does not care about the sheep.
I am the good shepherd.
as the Father knows me, and I know the Father...
in the same way I know my sheep, and they know me.
and I am willing to die for them.
there are other sheep which belong to me...
that are not in this sheep pen.
I must bring them, too.
they will listen to my voice...
and they will become one flock with one shepherd.
the Father loves me...
because I am willing to give up my life in order that I may receive it back again.
no one takes my life away from me.
I give it up of my own free will.
I have the right to give it up...
and I have the right to take it back.
this is what my Father has commanded me to do.
again there was division among the people because of these words.
he has a demon! -He is crazy!
why do you listen to him? -A man with a demon cannot talk like this!
how could a demon give sight to blind people?
it was winter...
and the Festival of the Dedication of the Temple was being celebrated in Jerusalem.
Jesus was walking in Solomon's Porch in the Temple...
when the people gathered round him.
how long are you going to keep us in suspense?
tell us the plain truth. Are you the Messiah?
I have already told you, but you would not believe me.
the deeds I do by my Father's authority speak on my behalf.
but you will not believe...
for you are not my sheep.
my sheep listen to my voice.
I know them, and they follow me.
I give them eternal life, and they shall never die.
no one can snatch them away from me.
what my Father has given me is greater than everything...
and no one can snatch them away from the Father's care.
the Father and I are one.
blasphemy! Stone him!
then the people again picked up stones to throw at him.
I have done many good deeds in your presence...
which the Father gave me to do.
for which one of these do you want to stone me?
we do not want to stone you because of any good deeds...
but because of your blasphemy!
you are only a man, but you are trying to make yourself God!
it is written in your own Law...
that God said, " You are gods. "
we know that what the scripture says is true forever...
and God called those people gods...
the people to whom his message was given.
as for me, the Father chose me and sent me into the world.
how, then, can you say that I blaspheme...
because I said that I am the Son of God?
do not believe me, then, if I am not doing the things my Father wants me to do.
but if I do them, even though you do not believe me...
you should at least believe my deeds...
in order that you may know, once and for all...
that the Father is in me...
and that I am in the Father.
blasphemy!
once more, they tried to seize Jesus, but he slipped out of their hands.
Jesus then went back again across the Jordan River...
to the place where John had been baptizing...
and he stayed there.
many people came to him.
'john performed no miracls, " they said...
'but everything he said about this man was true. "
and many people there believed in him.
a man named Lazarus, who lived in Bethany, became sick.
Bethany was the town where Mary and her sister Martha lived.
this Mary was the one who poured the perfume on the Lord's feet and wiped them with her hair.
it was her brother, Lazarus, who was sick.
the sisters sent Jesus a message.
'Lord, your dear friend is sick. "
when Jesus heard it, he said.
'the final result of this sickness will not be the death of Lazarus.
'this has happened in order to bring glory to God...
'and it will be the means by which the Son of God will receive glory. "
Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
yet when he received the news that Lazarus was sick...
he stayed where he was for two more days.
then he said to his disciples, " Let us go back to Judea. "
teacher, just a short time ago, the people there wanted to stone you...
and are you planning to go back?
a day has 1 2 hours, doesn't it?
so those who walk in broad daylight do not stumble...
for they see the light of this world.
but if they walk during the night, they stumble...
because they have no light.
our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep...
but I will go and wake him up.
if he is asleep, Lord, he will get well.
Jesus meant that Lazarus had died...
but they thought he meant natural sleep.
so Jesus told them plainly.
Lazarus is dead.
but for your sake...
I am glad that I was not with him...
so that you will believe.
let us go to him.
Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples.
let us all go along with the Teacher, so that we may die with him!
when Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been buried four days before.
Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem...
and many Judeans had come to see Martha and Mary...
to comfort them about their brother's death.
when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him...
but Mary stayed in the house.
if you had been here, Lord...
my brother would not have died.
but I know that even now...
God will give you whatever you ask him for.
your brother will rise to life.
I know that he will rise to life on the last day.
I am the resurrection and the life.
those who believe in me will live...
even though they die.
and those who live and believe in me...
will never die.
do you believe this?
Yes, Lord.
I do believe that you are the Messiah...
the Son of God, who is to come into the world.
after Martha said this...
she went back and called her sister Mary privately.
the Teacher is here...
and is asking for you.
when Mary heard this, she got up and hurried out to meet him.
Jesus had not yet arrived in the village...
but was still in the place where Martha had met him.
the people who were in the house with Mary, comforting her...
followed her when they saw her get up and hurry out.
they thought that she was going to the grave to weep there.
Mary arrived where Jesus was, and as soon as she saw him, she fell at his feet.
Lord...
if you had been here...
my brother would not have died.
Jesus saw her weeping...
and he saw how the people with her were weeping also.
his heart was touched, and he was deeply moved.
where have you buried him?
come and see, Lord.
Jesus wept.
'see how much he loved him, " the people said.
but some of them said:
'he gave sight to the blind man, didn't he?
'could he not have kept Lazarus from dying? "
deeply moved once more, Jesus went to the tomb...
which was a cave with a stone placed at the entrance.
take the stone away.
there will be a bad smell, Lord. He has been buried four days.
didn't I tell you that you would see God's glory if you believed?
they took the stone away.
Jesus looked up.
I thank you, Father, that you listen to me.
I know that you always listen to me...
but I say this for the sake of the people here...
so that they will believe that you sent me.
after he had said this, he called out in a loud voice:
Lazarus...
come out!
he came out...
his hands and feet wrapped in grave clothes...
and with a cloth round his face.
untie him, and let him go.
many of the people who had come to visit Mary saw what Jesus did...
and they believed in him.
but some of them returned to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
so the Pharisees and the chief priests met with the Council and said.
'what shall we do? "
look at all the miracles this man is performing!
if we let him go on in this way, everyone will believe in him...
and the Roman authorities will take action and destroy our temple and our nation!
one of them, named Caiaphas, who was High Priest that year, said.
what fools you are!
don't you realize...
that it is better for you to have let one man die for the people...
instead of having the whole nation destroyed?
actually, he did not say this of his own accord.
rather, as he was High Priest that year...
he was prophesying that Jesus was going to die for the Jewish people...
and not only for them, but also to bring together into one body...
all the scattered people of God.
from that day on, the Jewish authorities made plans to kill Jesus.
so Jesus did not travel openly in Judea, but left, and went to a place near the desert...
to a town named Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.
the time for the Passover Festival was near...
and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem...
to perform the ritual of purification before the festival.
they were looking for Jesus...
and as they gathered in the Temple, they asked one another.
'what do you think? Surely, he will not come to the Festival, will he? "
the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders...
I've never been so close before.
I know how much this means to you.
the county commission went off walking on air...
when Chuck Raven brought Dickie Pilager to the table.
that was a nice thing for him to do.
nice? I'm paying Chandler Tyson a fortune for that kind of access.
a fortune? - A slice of the pie.
but they were starstruck, Gracie.
the zoning's in the bag.
these people will bend over backwards.
you have worked so hard.
if we were a little bit more liquid...
I'd sink every dime we have into this thing.
like you did that time with the stock market?
hell, it's more than the money.
I'm building a city, Grace.
a city.
we run something on the Web site...
information we've got... we connect the dots...
and the guilty party, they pretend to ignore it.
if they sue us, certain documents could be entered in a court of law...
where if you deny things it's perjury.
you gotta have the documents.
it's amazing what things are blowing under my door and end up on my desk.
so, you plant the seed.
and the mainstream guys, the print journalists...
they bring it to their editors and their editors say...
cool your jets. This is too far out. We don't have the resources.
we don't have the balls to go after this kind of thing.
but track the story...
and if it ever breaks...
you gotta have the balls.
so we keep accumulating the facts...
till the story is screaming out so loud it's impossible to ignore.
and they run a little test item on page six...saying allegations have been made.
allegations?
it's beneath their dignity to quote some cellar-dweller Web site...
in their hallowed journal.
but the bastards in power have to publicly deny those allegations...
and then they're fair game.
first it's the columnists taking potshots.
then when they've got the politicians on the run...
they use our legwork, our ideas to write outraged exposes and win Pulitzers.
then they gang up like a pack of jackals.
but somebody has to plant the seed.
the seed of doubt.
he seems a lot more gubernatorial with the sound off.
for a day is coming, my friends...
a great day and a terrible day...
a day when the skies shall open and the waters shall part...
and the dead shall rise up and walk upon the Earth.
and the wicked and the righteous shall be judged alike.
but that day cannot come...
unless the children of Israel are within the holy land...
for so it has been prophesied in the great Book of Revelations.
so let us look at a map of the Middle East.
let us look at the headlines of today...
and see what conclusions we can draw from the evidence.
many are the portents and the signs.
but we need to discern a pattern.
we need to connect one event with the other...
and it will be clear that there are no accidents...
that there is a greater force at work...
and it holds the plan for Armageddon.
richard Pilager cares about the American worker.
you work with the same bunch all the time?
Yeah, more or less. As far as I know, they're all citizens.
I wasn't asking that.
Mojados are a bit cheaper, but they're not worth the hassle.
need some hard huevos to keep 'em in line.
not that I got anything against 'em.
I wouldn't go that far.
but you should check into the packing houses across town.
they got a lot of'em in there making chorizo.
any of your own guys been missing the last few days?
you're looking for this Lazaro, right?
cops were here this morning asking the same thing.
I'm not a cop. - No shit.
but it's like I told him. I got no Lazaros here.
who brings 'em up...
here in Timberline County?
you heard of Vince Esparza? - Yeah, I've heard the name.
he's the Saddam-fucking-Hussein of labor contractors.
they pay the coyote half up front to get them across the border...
and when they're delivered here they owe Esparza the rest.
so they start in the hole. - And they stay in it.
he keeps them moving around the country...
keeps them isolated, keeps them scared.
where can I find him?
you do not want to fuck with Vicente Esparza, my friend.
I hired a few of his boys without knowing it once.
they'd run off or try to make their way back home.
next thing I know, I got a shotgun stuck in my face.
what's up?
Daniel O'Brien. I called earlier.
she's back in the rink.
just keep heading straight through. - Thanks.
I wanna play that last one back.
nice shot.
training for the Olympics?
actually, I am.
the only sport I'm not already too old for.
no, thanks.
helps me with the Zen aspect of the thing.
eventually the arrow should become one with the bull's-eye and release itself.
then I'll just be like a channel.
so, you from Home and Garden or what? - I'm working for Chuck Raven.
go on.
you're, like, really accurate with that, right?
it depends on how much dope I've smoked.
how much have you smoked? - I've lost track.
there was an incident on the campaign trail...
that was potentially embarrassing to your brother.
what, he made a speech without a teleprompter?
there was a dead body involved.
anyone I know?
Lazaro Huerta?
can't place him.
maybe just another skeleton out of Daddy's closet.
you sure you don't want a hit?
you look a little tense. - No. It makes me paranoid.
like someone's got you in their crosshairs?
Yeah. Something like that.
how about a drink then? A bottle of tequila by your left leg.
you're not gonna, like, shoot it out of my hand or anything?
relax.
so you're some kind of a campaign lackey?
investigator. - Am I being investigated?
Mr. Raven thinks you may be harboring a grudge.
my whole life is a fucking grudge.
investigator.
you go to some kind of school for that?
no, I was working as a reporter.
I hate reporters. - Well, I'm not one anymore.
fifteen years old, I'm pregnant...
the fucking Mountain Monitor outs me.
senator's Daughter In College Sex Scandal.
it was before my time.
the whole thing was set up.
fly to Nevada, nice, quiet operation, back to school within a week.
you could still have had a... - Public abortion?
with the Christian crusaders block-voting for my father?
so he advised you not to.
I was a hopeful. - A hopeful?
Yeah. Olympic hopeful.
figure skating.
nine months carrying Dewey Junior...
another four to recover.
my body wasn't the same.
your center of gravity changes...
and you can't do the jumps.
that's what happened to Tonya Harding, you know.
it wasn't Nancy Kerrigan. It was her center of gravity.
you mature, your perception changes...
and you never get it back.
what's your name?
you're cute.
Thanks.
if I'm being investigated, I could do worse.
excuse me.
and who wants to know?
you gotta be him.
how you figure on that?
it's the shoes, ese. Braceros don't be wearing their party boots on the job.
Vince Esparza. Man, you a legend.
people say you got crews working all over the county.
people say a lot of shit that isn't necessarily true.
I'm looking for a guy named Lazaro Huerta.
I don't keep track of their names.
I'm not runnin' a summer camp here.
would you mind if I was to ask your jornaleros a few questions?
Yeah, I would mind. They're here to work.
they wanna blow their nose, scratch their balls, talk about their girlfriends...
they can do it on their own time.
this is a job here. This is private property.
and if someone who is not authorized to be here was to get hurt...
it'd be my responsibility.
they're hiding something.
my first husband was a downhill racer.
won the bronze at Innsbruck.
Wow.
he ditched me in, what, '85.
my girlfriend just moved out.
you poor baby.
took my couch.
you can have this one if you want.
she picked it out. It was both of ours.
she paid for half of it.
Rodney? They called him Hot Rod.
won the bronze?
he runs a lodge in Aspen he got as a settlement.
he sued you for alimony?
daddy paid him off so he wouldn't file adultery charges.
anything to avoid another public scandal.
you were adultering?
Yeah. But so was he.
but he was the one who hired some fucking investigator to take pictures.
we don't do much of that these days... divorce stuff.
transom peeping? - Nobody has transoms anymore.
but you still peep.
well, mostly it's on, you know, computer records.
we have ways to access. We share information, buy lists...
your credit balance, where you travel, what videos you rent.
Wow.
that's invasion of privacy.
so the skier ditched you.
then I tried living in California for a while...
but there was nobody there to embarrass but myself.
so you are trying to embarrass him. - It's pointless.
what could I do they haven't seen worse on some reality show?
you're a senator's daughter...
sister to the future governor.
they catch one president getting a BJ in the Oval Office.
the next rigs the election, gets away with it.
people have lost the ability to be scandalized.
so now your ambition is?
make sure my son gets out of his 20s in one piece.
represent my country in 2004.
you're that good at it, huh?
you know...
the Amazon women amputated one of their breasts.
it got in the way of the bow string.
give me three of those lottery tickets.
I'm feeling kinda lucky all of the sudden.
somebody's fucking with me.
these were bad guys.
they owned a whole bunch of low-rent housing downtown.
the building boom had started, and they had a big offer to sell...
but they couldn't legally evict their tenants.
so they were doing strong-arm stuff, intimidating.
there was even some arson involved. - The march of progress.
the housing inspector who should have been on top of this... Skaggs...
was taking payoffs.
I had these two informants... very Deep Throat.
meetings in parking garages, the whole deal.
and they give me the big lead.
now, this is criminal activity that they're exposing.
so I write the story. My editor, Mitch, he trusts me enough to run with it.
and they're willing to testify in court?
they said yeah, if it came to it. But I didn't have 'em on tape.
the landlord and the inspector sue the paper...
one of my sources blows town and the other flat denies it.
big retraction, settlement out of court...
and I'm seriously fired.
worse, I'm the guy who fabricates.
from that day on...
the Monitor concentrated on who bakes the best chocolate chip cookie in Denver.
and I couldn't get a job delivering a newspaper.
the editor should've... - He got fired too.
he runs a... What do you call it? A Web site.
at least you did something.
you know? I've just been taking up space and emptying out my trust fund.
Hey, you took all these pictures.
that's a hobby.
you raised a kid.
isn't he gorgeous?
his father... His biological father...
bugged out of the whole deal.
I can't blame him, with the publicity and what a little tramp I was then.
but Dewey Junior is a...
he's a nice guy, you know.
despite having me for a mother.
you raised a nice kid.
maybe that's what you're good at.
one of the things I'm good at.
this is a nation based on Christian principles.
what I promise to work for...is a government that respects those principles.
a government that supports traditional family values...
that respects the sanctity of human life.
a government strong enough, brave enough...to maintain the cultural equilibrium.
what's "cultural equilibrium" mean?
no handouts for homos.
Hey.
what's up, sugar? - Can some of the guys stay over tonight?
they don't have homes?
they don't have satellite. There's stuff we want to watch.
you'll have to sort out where everybody sleeps.
I can handle that. - You sounded really good today.
you should find a club to play in.
we don't have any of our own material. - So write some.
write about what a mess your mother is, like Eminem does.
Yeah.
see ya. - See ya.
closing time at the zoo. Get your clothes on.
I haven't slept this well in days.
Yeah, I don't sleep much unless I pass out.
one nation under God...
with liberty and justice...
who is this?
Chuck.
it's Maddy Pilager calling.
how'd you get my number? - Never mind, you little creep.
I just fucked your messenger boy.
Danny... What's your last name again?
Oh, shit. - Danny O'Shit.
tell him I'm firing him.
you send anybody else after me, I swear I'll put an arrow through his neck.
you need help, Maddy. You're a sick person.
I love you too.
he says you should check in with your office more often.
you were fired this morning.
Hey.
you get the boot? - I guess so.
don't take it personally. She's kinda moody.
right.
so, you're a detective.
investigator.
you look for missing people? - That can be part of the job.
you usually find them?
depends on how long they've been missing.
twenty-three years.
my father.
Dewey Hamilton.
right. - So, how would I start?
you know, like if he's moved out of the state?
sometimes people can...
sometimes people don't want to be found.
and if you do, it can be pretty disappointing.
if things are messy, you gotta face them sooner or later.
are you on the Web? - Wired to the eyeballs.
there are a couple of things you can try.
glad you could make it. - You're conscious.
painkillers, man.
I'm flying.
they said you had an accident?
it wasn't no accident.
I saw the boots.
you know.
the one who sticks his head in the sand.
ostrich?
ostrich-skin boots.
puts his head into the sand 'cause they don't wanna see when they cut his throat.
it was vehicular homicide, man.
dude tried to kill me with my own car.
paper on the table.
fito and Rafi. Carbonville.
they knew our dead man.
they're pretty spooked.
but you could try them.
they got maybe three words of English.
spooked by?
the same hijo de la chingada pushed the car on me.
Vince Esparza.
Vince. - Vicente.
Esparza.
I'll give you odds he had something to do with...
this Lazaro kicking the bucket.
O'Brien.
I been tryin' to track you down.
sheriff Skaggs, my friend Tony Guerra.
shaving accident?
you'll make me laugh and break my ribs again.
I haven't heard a peep out of you, Danny. That wasn't our agreement.
I'm off the case. - Step on your own dick again?
used to be this guy was a reporter...
till his mouth got way ahead of his brains.
there's a lot more to this than some illegal alien floating in a lake.
the people who hired me... - The people who hired you fired you...
which means you're out of the conversation.
they hired me to pretend... - That means make yourself scarce, son.
I need to talk to your amigo here, alone.
later, Tony.
you sleep with a client's sister? That is so unprofessional!
that's not why Raven wanted me off the case, is it?
no, but he didn't like it!
he wanted me off'cause I'm getting too close to something they wanna hush up!
that's the whole point of the job, Danny...
and he doesn't trust you to do it!
I don't have all the pieces, but Lazaro... - You don't have any pieces!
he knew something, saw something, and they set him up!
had him killed.
Chuck Raven had you fired because he found out you used to be a reporter.
okay?
that doesn't change anything.
he called yesterday morning.
if you would check your cell phone once in a while, you'd know that.
that sheriff, he's been right on my tail.
I cannot deal with your paranoia.
take the rest of the week off, come in on Monday...
and we will sit down and discuss what's left of your so-called career.
my expenses so far.
fill out a voucher. Hilary will take care of you.
look, Danny, I'm sure you were doing a very good job...
aside from banging Maddy Pilager.
Hey. She got me stoned. - Out!
sign here.
and next time I want all the receipts.
right.
lupe!
here, let me help you with this.
thank you. - How would you like to make $200?
they said these two men, Rafi and Fito...
have gone to the church.
it's not Sunday.
the day of the dead.
tell 'em I came instead of Tony.
they don't trust you.
tell them I have their names and that if they want to stay in this country...
you wouldn't do that to them, would you?
they don't know that, do they?
we can go somewhere else to talk.
they say you have to come with them to the ruins, to Silver City.
so, when do we get to this joint?
this is it.
they buried the city years ago.
what now?
this is where Lazaro died?
he says Lazaro died where they take the meat from the bones.
the slaughterhouse.
Benagra. - The Benagra slaughterhouse.
Lazaro was a newly arrived.
he was a very shy person.
very afraid of everything in the north.
but especially afraid of the boss.
and the jefe was? - Vicente Esparza.
Vincent Esparza carries a gun?
we were the cleaning crew.
after midnight, when they stop the line...
they come in to clean the metal with scalding hot water mixed with clorina.
there is always so much noise...
and you can't see from the steam.
they have told Don Vicente that the job up above...
cleaning the machine that takes the skin off the cows is not safe...
that there has to be more scaffolding or something to hold onto.
but he says that only little babies are crying for their mamas...
and he sends whoever he doesn't like to do it.
this day he sends Lazaro Huerta.
they told Lazaro he shouldn't shoot the steam full pressure...
when he's turning it on.
there was nobody else in that part of the factory...
but these two men and Vicente, their boss.
he asked them to put the body in a garbage barrel...
and to clean his blood with the blood of the animals.
at the end of work, they carried the body out to his truck and he drove them here.
he told them he knew this place from years ago...
when he was hired to hide some kind of garbage.
they felt bad treating a man they knew... a human being...
like he was garbage too.
they left the body at the back of the tunnel...
and Vicente told them that now they are part of a crime...
and if the police finds out they are going to jail.
if he doesn't kill them first.
so you left the body up here?
they came back three days later to bury him as a Christian, but...
he wasn't here?
he was gone. Maybe it was a miracle.
they left him where there was water on the floor.
so when they came back the water was this high.
show me.
come on.
all right.
wait for me here.
help!
help!
help, up there!
Mr. O'Brien!
are you there?
Mr. O'Brien!
Mr. O'Brien, you got all wet!
look at you!
where are the guys? - They took them away.
took them?
la Migra come, chase those men and take them away.
how come they didn't take you?
because I carry my citizen papers always.
guess I'll have to leave you here, Lupe.
it's okay.
how come you didn't take the day off?
I belong to the Iglesia Evangelica.
this? This is the devil's work.
I'll keep that in mind.
thanks for everything.
be careful, Mr. O'Brien.
Hey.
you again.
Hey.
I'm sorry about last night.
I get disgusted with myself, and I take it out on other people.
don't worry about it.
you been swimming?
cave diving.
I'm sorry if I got you in trouble.
the thing I'm investigating, I got a little in over my head.
you got fired? - Probation.
sorry.
do you think you might call me sometime?
listen, Maddy...
you're scared of me, aren't you?
no. I'm scared of your family.
would you say those are ostrich skin?
the guy's boots?
Yeah. Tony Lamas.
excuse me.
you got a problem, my friend?
you're Vicente Esparza.
come on. We gotta talk, you and me.
you're the one who's been stirrin' up all this shit, huh?
askin' about tattoos, botherin' my workers.
now I hear the police are lookin' for me.
I've got nothing against you. It's the people above you...
the ones that had you dump those barrels into the mine.
they knew what happened to Lazaro... - What the fuck is it to you?
you don't come down here where I live asking me fuckin' questions!
I'm not after you. It's them! - That's right.
you don't care about me, and I don't care about you.
I don't care if you live or you die.
you see this?
you see what this is, cabron?
you ask me one more fuckin' question...
don't move! Just freeze right there!
put it down, Dave.
one's deader than a doornail, and the other's unarmed.
put it down. - He had his gun out.
put it in the holster!
and then go keep that crowd from coming back here! Go!
Jesus!
you said it. - He wasn't gonna shoot your deputy.
boy's a little overtrained.
this is Esparza? - Yeah.
he's got that wanted-for-questioning...
Killed-while-resisting-arrest look about him.
they didn't clean up the cyanide waste.
they just dumped it into an old mine.
esparza was working for Bentel then.
he told my guys that he'd dumped something there before.
only it's flooded now, and it's flooding more every day.
somehow Huerta's body got swept away by it...
and pushed through the mountain into one of the streams that feeds the lake.
this is sounding crazy, isn't it?
throw a dead body into a cave...
and three days later it comes back out into the world all on its own?
sure, a lot of people'll buy that.
it's the water pressure.
the names of these two Mexicans you say you talked to...
come on!
you had Immigration follow us and pick them up.
did I? - Half this town is illegal.
immigration is gonna bother to drive into the middle of nowhere...
and just run into my witnesses?
Mr. Quinones and Mr. Lopez have been debriefed by the I NS.
according to them, they were working at BENagra Packing...
along with a certain Lazaro Huerta, also an undocumented alien...
until one day he chose...not to show up for work.
that's the last they saw of him.
of course they're gonna say that. - They're back on a plane in 24 hours...
courtesy of the United States government.
unless, of course...
you choose to include that crock of shit that you just told me...
in your official statement...
in which case, they'd be accessories to wrongful death, at least.
possibly murder.
they'd be fucked.
bien Jodido is the phrase, I believe, yeah.
slaughterhouse?
the slaughterhouse operates within guidelines set by the law.
all we've got is a failure to report an accident...
and illegal burial...
which begins and ends with Vince Esparza.
doesn't it?
I'll give you a few minutes to think about it.
you called his name.
when you were looking for him, you called his name.
your buddy in the hospital put us on the lookout.
vehicular homicide?
it's the same speech every time. - I don't have time now, Nora.
if I spent a few hours reviewing his statistics...
later.
instead of just listening to him go on and on and on... Come on, Leo!
come on!
what's the deal? - Where have you been?
out reporting the news. I know it's easier to watch it on cable, but...
staff meeting in 15 minutes, people!
then it's true. - What?
they'll say, "Nobody'll be let go.
but when they bought the Sentinel, they cut 30 jobs the first month.
they who? What are you talking about?
we've been sold to Gold Mine Publishing, that Bentel owns.
these Rocky Mountains that I love so much...
are part of our national heritage...
something we must keep safe for future generations.
don't even think about it.
whatever pathetic publicity stunt you're hatching...
in that drug-addled brain of yours.
I don't work for you anymore. - I know.
you were dismissed...
when we discovered an incident of substance abuse on the job.
anything you say... - Don't threaten me.
you are the boy that cried wolf, O'Brien.
it was in all the papers. - A murder was committed.
what?
murder by deregulation? That kind of thinking went out in the last century.
that's not the point.
the point is that without a smoking gun...
all you've got is another opportunity...
to fuck up your sorry excuse for a life even more than now.
people like you think you've got everything covered.
you think nobody cares enough to fight back.
but someday your shit's gonna catch up with you, and when it does...
you're a loser.
that's already been established beyond doubt.
so just try and be a good one.
okay?
don't you think you ought to change your shirt?
how'd you find me? - I'm a detective.
you said we were investigators.
I'm a detective. You're an investigator.
and the first rule is, don't go finding more than you're looking for.
look, if it weren't for Mort...
all of his plans, every scheme he's ever had...
has had a jinx on it.
his wife has to support him. He thinks he's a failure.
if this Silver City thing were to fall through...
up to his neck.
hush money?
severance pay.
and don't go making trouble, Danny.
won't do any good.
so why'd you ever hire a basket case like me?
look who I married.
travel expenses.
richard Pilager cares about you.
it's like he's a bad actor that doesn't believe himself in the part. You know?
you read these polls... I swear, the questions must be:
would you rather have Dickie Pilager as governor...
or have your pancreas pulled out through your nose with a rusty coat hanger?
but still, 33% prefer the coat hanger.
what's this?
weird.
silver City.
someone left us a treasure map.
I hear you've been bought.
I mean, not you personally. - Part of the happy Bentel family.
there's a man named Lazaro Huerta in that box... what's left of him.
so, this is your case.
Mr. O'Brien, yes? - Yes.
senora. - Hello.
Ramon Contreras from the Mexican consulate.
on behalf of the aggrieved family...
I offer my sincere gratitude for your generosity.
I'd like to wire some money...
on top of the casket and the shipping costs.
they won't...
anything you could send would be appreciated.
there are several children.
if you'll excuse me...
the paperwork.
nice to meet you.
you haven't been sleeping.
no, not really.
I split up with Chandler.
Really?
I was... grousing about communications monopolies...
and he gave me his usual line...
and we got into a fight, one thing led to another and...
conflict of interests.
many a promising merger has failed due to a conflict of interest.
right.
how do you feel... about us splitting up?
euphoric.
that's how I felt.
I should have been suicidal.
my paper's been co-opted...
I have all these people to call and tell them they're not invited...
to the wedding in Aspen, and...
were you gonna do one of those ski-lift ceremonies?
it would have been a very tasteful, very Caucasian affair.
if you change your mind, I know of a very good caterer.
maybe we could see each other sometime.
that'd be great.
so, you quit your job.
grace fired me.
so, what do you do now?
first I need to repaint my living room.
I promise to respect and support our American traditions...
I'm waiting.
our right to bear arms...
I'm still waiting.
our right to the freedoms of religious worship and expression...
so fundamental to our liberty.
I promise to support a smaller, more efficient government.
no longer must the Big Brother of the social welfare system...
dictate our daily lives...
intruding, impeding, regulating...
the very air that we breathe.
what I'm talking about, my fellow citizens...
comes down to that precious word "freedom."
a freedom enjoyed by those bold individuals...
who came to a wild frontier and built the West that we love so dearly...
those steadfast men and women...
whose spirit of daring and conquest...
inspires us to this day.
the freedom from fear of those who envy our good fortune...
who scorn our democratic institutions.
freedom from the cultural tyranny...
of the special interest groups and the new-age demagogues...
who would seek to deny us...
the harvest of our God-given bounty...
under the false banner of environmental correctness.
the freedom to seek health, happiness...and, yes, fortune...
in this glorious mountain state of ours.
this is the freedom I promise you, my fellow citizens.
but let not a man be judged by the promises he makes...
but by the works he leaves behind.

John, damn it.
I've been hit! I'm down!
Pelham! - On the west side!
Pelham's down.
I need you to lead me in!
we don't know how many suspects are in there.
risking one life to save one life... - Shut up!
lead me in! Move!
Hey, buddy. So this ain't good.
no, it's not. Could always be worse!
it just got worse.
they were ready for us, John.
how did Insyndicate know we were coming?
how did they know?
MX! - How'd they know?
we're getting out of here. Give me a diagnostic!
blood pressure's dropping, celiac artery's blown apart.
there's nothing to do, sir.
we're getting out of here.
he will bleed to death - before you get him out of here. - Shut up!
cover us! We're leaving!
I cannot do that.
others have a better statistical chance of surviving.
I need to protect them.
are you staying with your partner?
you're damn right I am!
Hey! Come back here!
come on.
tell me what you remember.
this time...
I remember the radio call.
from Pelham.
your partner.
Yeah. - But not much more than that.
I still can't remember every detail.
I want to go again.
you made good progress tonight, John.
you were in a coma for 17 months, yes?
technically, we shouldn't be doing this procedure until you've been fully conscious for one year.
Yeah.
well, technically...
you're an unlicensed doctor from Sub Asia practicing black market medicine.
well, yes, you can throw me in prison if you want, but... I accepted you as a patient out of kindness.
you seemed like a desperate man when I met you.
and now?
now... you seem like a desperate man.
John, I know you said the people who ambushed you disappeared, but, despite my best efforts, you may not remember who they are.
most people come to a Recollectionist...
they want to remember good things.
why can't you let this go?
it's been two years.
you know...
they killed my team...
...my friends.
and without this treatment, I can't remember anything.
I remembered something else this time.
my ex-girlfriend.
Anna.
we were in my apartment.
strange.
I'll, uh...
refine the triggering of that cluster next time.
your nose is bleeding.
detective.
you all right?
Yeah.
Where's your MX?
I'm off duty.
Where's your human? - Talking to a witness.
individuals came over the wall an hour ago.
drive safely.
Yeah, I will.
message saved for 738 days.
Hi, honey.
so, I know you're probably still asleep, but,
John, the sun is setting and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
look.
your father would've loved this place.
Oh, I can't wait to get back to you.
I know I have to wait a week, but...
what I really wish is that you were here with me.
morning. - Morning.
you coming in? - I know I said I was ready.
just give me one more day.
no. I already gave you one more day.
and another and another.
it's time, John.
John?
in South Kelvin.
looks like it was Insyndicate.
Insyndicate?
okay.
I'll come in.
synthetic calibration incomplete.
synthetic calibration incomplete.
synthetic calibration incompl...
I can't access the system. Are you in?
I'm in. - I'm not in. I'm out.
all my files are locked.
sounds like Martinez is messing with you again.
we're supposed to be in a truce, so, if that's true, I'm gonna kill him.
well, there is one other possibility.
did you forget your password again,
detective Vogel?
not bad for a guy who's been asleep for two years.
I wouldn't say that.
he looks weak, to me.
Richard,
I know this won't be easy for you: don't be a prick.
this department's handled affairs just fine without him.
what's your problem with Kennex?
don't ask to hear the story-- you'll die of boredom.
and exposure to severe envy.
look, there's nothing to envy in him.
Kennex oversaw that raid, controlled all the intel and got his team ambushed.
everyone, except the one man responsible-- Kennex--was killed.
should've been discharged.
Richard.
he won't last.
you just watch.
Kennex John. Registration complete.
Thanks.
detective Kennex,
I'm 785. I've been assigned to you.
I'm aware this is your first day back.
I only want to make your acclimation to active duty as smooth as possible for you.
I'm here to attend to all your n...
I'm not driving with one of those things.
human partner was good enough for my father.
it's good enough for me.
since you were last here,
MX partners have become mandatory.
I'm not gonna fight you on some kind of regulation thing, okay?
I'm not doing it. - Like hell you're not.
have you read Tilden's profile of you?
and, by the way, he is a very capable psychiatrist.
Kennex should return to service never.
never? Wow, that's... that's a long time. - Kennex is suffering "from depression, mental atrophy, "trauma onset OCD, PTSD and psychological rejection of his synthetic body parts.
well, that last part is true.
listen, you're the only person more desperate than I am to find out how Insyndicate learned about the raid.
if we work together, we can do it.
this happened a few hours ago.
robbery target was an armored truck, carrying bio research.
if this is an Insyndicate operation, it might help us learn more about them.
what's the connection?
parabolic pulse charge was used to stop the vehicle.
I haven't seen that since the ambush.
well, sure looks like Insyndicate.
inventory report? - That's not in yet.
whatever they wanted, they killed four security guards to get it.
one of the thieves was shot.
he's being treated at County.
John?
keep the Insyndicate connection between us, okay?
you think someone in the department's working with them?
you're the only guy I trust here.
okay.
I'll check it out.
one more thing.
go easy on your partner.
come.
truck belongs to a private lab run by Omni, company specializing in DNA research.
according to the manager, they were transporting vials of single-strand synthetic, programmable DNA.
detective? Valerie Stahl.
John Kennex.
pleasure to meet you. - You, too.
okay.
so tell me what you got on programmable DNA.
programmable DNA can be used to trigger the process of tissue creation.
for example, to grow sets of organs in humans, possibly for harvest.
what else was taken?
acid, bencarmidium, thianel, Myklon Red.
Myklon Red.
detective?
detective, you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.
this sector is Khmer Black territory.
they've been known to traffic in biotech in the past.
we're rounding up the usual suspects.
you don't buy it?
ruby Mah assumed leadership of the gang six months ago when his brother was killed.
it was controversial.
he's seen as too western.
he needs to show the people he's traditional.
today is the last day of the Cambodian New Year,
a day of repentance for wrongdoing.
he wouldn't commit violence today.
this was another gang.
I find behavioral tendencies in data and identify criminal patterns.
or didn't intelligence analysts do that before I got here?
Thanks. I, uh... I really appreciate it.
excuse me.
sure.
tell command we're 10-19.
what happened back there?
what are you talking about?
it seemed like a petit mal seizure.
I will need to report what I saw.
I'm fine. You're not gonna report anything.
you were in Koln Avenue District last night.
an MX saw you there.
I am concerned, Detective.
that area is populated by numerous black market medical clinics.
and some tasty noodle joints.
look, I appreciate your concern, but there's nothing to report.
another curious thing, Detective Kennex?
last night, there were no comestible trace particles on your breath, indicating you were not there for noodles.
I think we should...
Hey, Rudy.
as I live and breathe.
or should I say, as you live and breathe?
how are ya?
constantly turning down party invitations.
I've become quite popular with the ladies.
how can I help?
I got a rec order for another synthetic.
he fell?
out of a moving car?
Yeah, crazy, huh?
must be some kind of software issue.
gonna need a new one.
software?
since we don't have any MXs available, department's only cleared one model for active duty.
funny, actually. This, uh...
this unit was scheduled to be transferred to NASA next month.
it's sad really.
he's scrap metal.
the trimidium circuits in his spinal column are worth more than the whole of him.
wait a minute. That's... that's one of the crazy ones.
what? No. That's rude. Not crazy, per se.
you know, they had their...
what? Problems? Who doesn't have problems?
technically, they're perfectly functional.
look at him.
he's road-worthy.
John, Dorian. Dorian, John.
there. Should be functional.
his DF was bad.
anything I need to know?
well, the DRN series,
they were based on a program called Synthetic Soul.
and while he isn't crazy, as you say, there may be some bugs.
bugs? What kind of bugs?
some of them had difficulty dealing with their emotive regulations.
emotional issues.
the idea behind the DRNs was to be as human as possible.
and the truth is that it's human to have unexpected emotional responses.
and if, uh, being as close to human was the goal, then,
I guess the DRNs weren't such a failure after all.
people have breaking points, and...
so do DRNs.
so you're saying he's a basket case.
not words I would use, or agree with.
all right, plug it in already.
I got to get back on the street. - Okay.
please have the honor of waking him up yourself.
touch it against his left ear.
how long was I out?
uh, four years and three months.
detective John Kennex.
I'm Dorian. How are you?
your record is outstanding.
used to be.
excuse me?
update your files. Let's go.
Hey, boss.
he's on the move. Let's go!
you heard him. Let's go.
so what do I call you?
detective.
well, Detective, this sure beats repairing thermal insulation tiles on the C. N.A. Space Station.
I was decommissioned four years ago, as you know.
why am I in this car with you?
I'm required to ride with a synthetic.
I'm not a huge fan of that term.
St. Christopher.
this has to be a gift from someone. Am I right?
something like 80% of these are given as gifts.
synthetics are precise.
there's that term again.
you just said, "Something like 80%."
the actual statistic is 83. 42%, but I'm running my colloquialism routine, so I express most data conversationally, man.
terrific.
so, who's "A"?
Addison? Annie? Adeline?
Alana? Anita?
Amy? Audrey? Aquamarine?
okay, that's enough, all right?
um... synthetic off.
synthetic off?
does that mean you want me to be quiet?
Yeah, whatever the mode is for you to be quiet, just do that.
Hey, man, I can be quiet.
you can just... ask.
synthetic calibration incomplete.
synthetic calibration incomplete.
stand by. I'll be back.
here you go, ma'am.
Yeah, give me a black coffee, no sugar.
you got it, Detective Vogel.
officer Vogel, it's good to see you again.
who are you?
haven't seen one of those synthetics for years.
it's perfect.
two cops from the scrap heap.
this is gonna be more pathetic than I thought.
those are the models that replaced me.
intimidating.
go register so we can get moving.
DRN registration complete.
Hey, bot.
don't snap on us, now.
sir, Detective Vogel's been abducted.
maldonado wants you on it.
his MX was destroyed.
this is all we could get off it.
based on the masks, these are the same guys from the armed robbery.
suspect back from County?
your gang kills four security guards.
now you've taken a cop.
where is he?
did they take him 'cause we have you?
you know what this is?
it's your booking file.
it describes the condition you were in when we got you.
now...
what are you doing with programmable DNA?
what's the Myklon Red for?
Oh, look, suspect has a scratch above his eye.
I have no idea how he got that.
better add it, and get ready to write down "missing molar."
there are other ways, Detective.
I'm questioning this man, okay, not you.
now...
synthetic fail. Calibration required.
synthetic fail. Calibration required.
synthetic fa...
you shot yourself.
perhaps it was a bit crazy this morning, maybe the doctors at County even missed it, but the trajectory of the bullet that hit you, the burn marks on your flesh
basically there's no chance that you were hit by a bullet from any gun but your own.
is that true?
you don't know the people I work for.
trust me, I do.
I needed to get away from them any way I could, because there's no getting away from them.
look, we can help you, we can keep you safe, but you need to give us information.
no, I'm not safe anywhere, not even here.
we'll put you in a secure location under guard.
no one will find you, but you need to talk.
I need to be somewhere safe.
then, where's Detective Vogel?
what's the address?
325 Grand, Apartment 6.
not that you need me to tell you this, but you just violated the crap out of that guy's civil rights.
fantastic, I get the synthetic with the bleeding heart.
look, I don't care what you're programmed to do.
you report what happened in there and you'll find yourself bouncing down the 604.
detective, if I'm going to report anything, it is because I decided it needed to be reported.
I feel sick.
I need a toilet.
you all right?
I'll be fine.
stop.
potential explosive device.
humans back.
evacuate the building.
DRN, halt advancement, halt advancement.
detective.
what is it?
it's not a bomb.
that trip wire leads somewhere.
I'll lead you in?
I do not advise that, sir.
let's go.
Vogel.
help!
stay calm.
Kennex, help me!
help!
do something!
bulletproof glass.
it's welded shut.
patel speaking.
patel, where are you?
en route to the safe house.
we have the perp in the car.
okay, turn around-- this whole thing's a setup.
patel, Patel.
no, no, no, no...
sergeant Patel and two other officers were killed, three MXs were destroyed, and the suspect escaped.
it's about time.
I'm sorry.
morgue lab is too slow.
get a lab box, take a sample of his blood, and send it to Rudy for analysis.
don't need a lab box.
I just downloaded the information.
Rudy should have the data now.
why him?
why target Vogel?
scan every case Vogel was on.
any connection to biotech, science, medicine, DNA.
I want to see it.
I don't know if this is anything, but one of his files is missing.
case file number 6663.
it's gone from all internal records.
wait a minute, Detective Vogel told me this morning that he couldn't get access to his terminal.
maybe whoever took him was deleting the file.
they got into the whole system.
who is they?
see if anyone downstairs can get that file back.
on my way.
the way you said that
you're thinking someone specific is behind this.
who?
when I want your help, I'll ask for it.
you know what your problem is?
always my favorite part of the day:
a synthetic telling me what my problem is.
there's that word again.
your problem is, you don't know yourself.
you don't trust anyone.
is that my problem?
and, man, I don't blame you.
after all you've been through, if I were like you, I wouldn't know myself either.
okay, firstly stop saying "Man."
secondly you're not like me.
and I'm not like them.
MX units are logic-based and rule-oriented.
they have no true free will and they are designed to feel nothing.
now, I can't say that I was born,
I can't say I grew in a womb or had a childhood, but I was made to feel and I do as much as you.
I read what you wrote:
that if an MX hadn't left you behind to save some others, your partner might have made it out of that ambush alive, and that part may be true, but I read the whole report.
by the time the ambush had begun, it was already too late and it was you who led them in, so you can blame an MX or you can blame yourself.
okay, you know what? - I am nothing - like an MX-43 - You're obviously malfunctioning right now.
why don't you just take a second to reboot yourself?
do not talk to me that way.
if anyone is malfunctioning, it is you, Kennex.
you know what I'm gonna stop doing?
I'm gonna stop arguing with a piece of silicon and carbon fiber.
Kennex.
it's Rudy.
all police in the department are required to have mandatory inoculations designed in police labs for officers only.
those inoculations are meant to keep cops safe.
protects against biowarfare, gases, pathogens, et cetera.
we found Myklon Red in Vogel's blood, combined with programmable DNA.
it targets the inoculation directly.
it's like getting a hundred different diseases at once.
the immune system goes berserk.
what are you saying, Rudy?
that's why his body reacted in the way that it did.
that's why he died.
I believe Detective Vogel was a test subject.
whoever we're up against...
they're targeting cops.
where are you going?
I cannot allow you to do this.
it's far too soon.
look, this isn't about me, okay?
someone is killing police officers, and the only way we're gonna find them is if I remember more about the people who are doing it.
John, it's not safe for you.
you do this and you do it now.
they were ready for us, John.
how did Insyndicate know we were coming?
how did they know? How'd they...?
Hey, come back here! You're damn rob...!
I am so sorry.
I told him it was too dangerous.
you used my locator chip.
maldonado wanted me to keep an eye on you.
okay.
you're lucky you got the partner with the bleeding heart.
what did you see... when you were under?
I saw someone who was close to me.
someone who, I realize now, that I should never have trusted.
I want to say I... I'm not even sure it's real, but...
but it was.
who was it, John?
it was my ex-girlfriend.
when I came out of my coma, she had disappeared.
now I know why.
synthetic fail.
calibration required.
synthetic fail. Calibration required.
I've got a fix for that.
what?
it gets creaky sometimes?
I've got a fix for that.
olive oil.
olive oil?
Yeah, man. You put it right on the joint.
olive oil?
you'll thank me.
I suppose I, uh...
I should acknowledge the fact that you saved my life.
no need.
I only did it because you're my one ticket.
without you, I'm off the force.
you're lucky I want to be a cop so bad.
you're not like them, the MXs.
I don't know why, but you're not.
I should take that as a compliment.
you should.
the MX series is based on first order predicate calculus.
MXs have no intuition, or as you might say, no soul.
for them, experience, memory is just recorded data.
my series is designed to draw conclusions, make inferences.
the answer is Vogel, right?
who was targeting him, what was the payback for?
Yeah.
and the only witness we have is Vogel's MX,
who was blown apart when they took Vogel.
Yeah, Ru-Rudy said his neural net was completely fried.
worthless to another MX, who wouldn't be able to-to put it together, to make sense of it, but you could make those connections.
if we transferred the memory, or whatever's left of the memory from Vogel's MX to you, you could make the connection.
it's worth a shot, Detective.
check, please!
I'm in its short-term memory now.
stand by. I'll be back.
...coffee... sugar.
officer Vogel.
it's good to see you again.
a few years ago, you logged something into evidence that doesn't belong to you.
you may remember it as case number 6663.
no?
well, your precinct has been kind enough to hold it in evidence, but tonight, we're gonna get it back, and you're gonna help us do it.
we've got something they want.
captain, we need to go into lockdown.
what's going on?
they're hitting us tonight.
they're after something in the evidence room!
light it up, take out the MXs.
the Insyndicates are on the roof!
come on, now. Go, go, go, go, go!
evacuate building.
evacuate building.
why are they shutting down and not you?
they run on a different frequency than mine.
sometimes newer technology isn't better.
come on.
open the valves.
we got to go through every piece by hand.
we don't even know what we're looking for.
we know it's here.
and we know it's valuable because they were willing to kill a lot of cops to get it.
there must be some way to restore those evidence files that were wiped.
I've been trying, but the sabotage was extremely thorough.
I'll keep trying.
Thanks, man.
rise...
and be counted.
stay out of trouble.
your father would have loved this place.
Oh, I can't wait to get back to you.
I know I have to wait a week, but what I really wish is that you were here with me.
we're gonna find her, John.
if you hadn't come back...
you saved a lot of lives.
Thanks.
thanks for insisting.
you put in the rec order.
for Dorian. I checked out his record.
it's mostly redacted, but I saw that it was you who put in the request for me to get him. Why?
the DRN is good for you.
Sandra... you didn't answer my question.
why Dorian?
cause he's special.
just like you.
see you at roll call.
I assume you want quiet mode, Detective?
not necessarily.
call me John.
but you gotta let me in, please!
ten minutes!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Hey! Stop right there!
sir, come here.
sir, I'm only gonna say this once... - No, please!
sir! - Please, they're gonna... they're gonna find me!
who's gonna find you? - They know where I am!
calm down! - They're gonna kill me!
you don't understand! - Calm down, sir!
when you came to see me six months ago, your emotions were boiling over with hate.
you were seething with frustration and disgust at your neighbors, at your fellow workers, at our government.
but today...
you are a different man.
and I am so proud of how far you've come.
what a complete and utter waste of my time.
I could not feel worse.
I don't feel at all better.
I hate everyone the same.
in fact, I think I hate you most.
okay.
but, Jim...
listen to yourself.
listen to your words.
two months ago, you would've been expressing this anger physically.
now you're using your words.
when I get these damn bandages off,
I'll be physical again.
well, you should be proud of yourself.
okay, John. What about you?
how are you feeling?
doc, I'm feeling great.
Really? - Yeah.
I'm feeling really good.
I don't want to encourage you to be angry, but I also don't want you to hide your feelings from us
and more importantly...
from yourself.
no, uh, look...
I'm the first to agree, you know?
I'm all for sharing feelings.
uh... but, uh...
I feel good.
what can I say?
John...
your girlfriend not only abandoned you, but she was secretly working for one of the most... Yeah. Mm-hmm.
infamous criminal organizations in this city.
the same organization that targeted and killed your entire squa in a gun battle and left you for dead, and, ultimately, left you with a synthetic leg.
yet, for the past several sessions, in what little you've told us, you're saying that...
you have no problems and you... feel good?
are you really, truly saying that you're being honest?
look, Doc, we all hit bumps in the road. You know?
everyone hits speed bumps, right?
the thing is,
I got my health, you know?
I got a job.
I got a new synthetic leg.
I can still... you know.
comparatively speaking...
I mean, I'm not like... like Marty over there.
I mean, no... no offense, Marty.
if I was in your shoes, pal, I tell you, I'd...
I'd really... , you know?
every week I walk in here, I think, "Oh, my God, is Marty gonna be here?"
and he is. Week in, week out.
I gotta hand it to you.
I'd get a divorce, I'd put the dog down, and I'd just stay away from peanut butter.
it's as simple as that, really.
I feel good.
I really do, you know?
what about you, uh... Anal?
you're good?
it's Aneal.
okay. Yeah.
Hey, Mr. Friendly.
how was Angry Class 101?
call me that again and I swear
I'll stick my boot right in your face.
clearly, it went well.
detective Kennex.
here's the preliminary report.
detective Paul is up there, sir.
Oh, I'm sorry, there's not much we can do about that.
victim is Anton Cross.
lived in Lakeshore Heights.
single gunshot wound to the upper torso.
large caliber round.
what do you got?
looks like three shots fired.
one through the skylight, one through that guy's Celo, and one into Mr. Lucky here, which fragmented on the wall.
the transit police said he was running.
they stopped him on the platform.
he was agitated, saying "They're gonna kill me."
three shots and no one saw a shooter?
correct.
and we only recovered one bullet.
one bullet?
it is possible that a single bullet was responsible for all three impacts.
if fired from the perfect angle and traveling along a consistent trajectory,
I believe a bullet could have cut through the skylight, continued through the Celo, bounced against the wall, ricocheted to the floor, and penetrated the victim's chest cavity.
let me get this straight.
you're suggesting that a single bullet came through the skylight, ricocheted and bounced its way through the subway, and then just miraculously hit a man square in the chest
who was, according to witnesses, running, screaming, "They're gonna kill me"?
while the likelihood seems improbable, there is a .004% chance that a shooter firing with this morning's five miles per hour northwesterly winds, would release a bullet that would only increase speed until hitting the skylight, where the trajectory would change nominally and the bullet would increase velocity due to air conditioning within the station.
a temporary deformation, coupled with inertia and the molecular structure of the wall, the Celo, and the floor, would inevitably allow for a fatal impact.
makes sense to me.
what do you think?
obviously, this is just a first look, but it appears that there's only residue from the skylight, and residue from the Celo.
yet there's no residue from the floor, making the likelihood that it bounced or ricocheted unlikely.
detective Kennex.
I appreciate you seeking multiple scenarios as to how this homicide occurred.
and I understand your partner is trying to assist you.
however, I must remind you that your partner is a DRN.
a discontinued...
please, do continue.
if you look here, there seems to be some sort of circuitry that's embedded in the slug.
now, we can't be sure until we a get a full analysis, but these markings don't look like scratches from a bullet hitting a wall.
again, Detective Kennex, your DRN is inferior.
it's not something you see every day.
its computing power is
on top of that,18 billion trilihertz less than my own.
I genuinely believe that
it does not have the ability to rationalize, analyze or deduct.
one bullet did do all of this damage.
you are continuing to listen to a retired old system, believing the rambling and illogical theories of your appropriately canceled partner.
if you would like,
I can put in a request for you to be partnered with an MX-4...
are you out of your mind?
you do not draw your weapon,
let alone fire it in a public place unless you're in danger!
doesn't fire his weapon?
who cares about him firing his weapon?
he's firing it at my MX!
come on. Since when do you care about an MX?
what if I put a bullet in Dorian's head?
don't even look at Dorian!
nobody is shooting any police officers.
let me explain something to you.
I'm a police officer.
you're a police officer.
and as much as it pains me to say it,
richard is a police officer.
now, you can dress these machines to look like cops.
you can program 'em to drive a car and shoot a gun like a cop.
but they're not cops.
they're bullet catchers.
and if you force me to work with a faulty machine, then I will dispose of it with the same degree of compassion that I would a toaster that burns my toast.
John, I don't know what to do with you.
I could give you a list of things I'd do with him.
Richard, let me handle this.
you better watch your ass.
your partner better watch his ass, too.
Richard, go down and find yourself another MX.
we've got a problem here, John.
Yeah, I agree.
I mean, what do you think he wants to do to my ass?
you know, your anger issues and your short fuse are known way beyond this precinct.
you were supposed to participate in therapy.
I'm participating.
and it's working.
it was just a minor slip, okay?
it could've been worse.
I mean, I could've shot Richard.
I understand Dorian found the victim's girlfriend.
get into that.
see what you can find out.
name: Kira Larsen.
1, 003 communications with Anton Cross in the last 12-week period.
where does she work?
trope Software.
that's the same as Anton Cross.
affirmative.
they work together.
address, please.
what?
you like me.
sorry? - You like me.
no, I don't. - Yes, you do.
no. - You definitely do.
how do you come by that conclusion?
the MX. You shot it because it insulted me. You like me. - No.
I shot the MX 'cause it wouldn't shut up. - Nope.
you shot it because you like me.
keep talking, I'll prove my point.
it's okay, John.
I like you, too.
Rudy, what's up?
uh, well, you were right, Dorian.
there is a power source in this bullet.
there are definitely, uh, micro-electro-mechanical systems embedded in, in the bullets.
um, active aerodynamics, which can alter the course of the bullets in flight.
I've never seen anything like it.
do we have any idea who might've made it or where it was manufactured?
not yet, but the MEMS circuits are highly specialized.
whoever fires this can control where this bullet goes.
it could literally chase you around a corner.
if the shooter wants you dead, the bullet will find you.
Hi.
we need to speak to Kira Larsen.
just one moment, Officer.
I'm Kira Larsen. What's this about?
I'm Detective John Kennex.
I'm afraid we have some very bad news.
I don't...
Anton would never hurt anyone in his life.
who would want to hurt him?
was he involved in any underground activities?
black market, drugs?
did he owe any money?
no.
black market?
Anton was a gamer.
he was an elder in Warriors of Grun.
we're trying to find out information about the weapon he was killed with.
when was the last time you heard from him?
uh, he left me a message.
when? - Last night.
Hey, K. You must be asleep.
uh, of course you are. Anyway, um, forget looking for the bio-stamp on the, uh... on the 318 liquifile.
I found it.
it's on my arm.
anyway, uh...
uh, I got to go.
love you.
see you tomorrow.
he seems distracted.
Oh, he's-he's working. That's how he always is.
I'm gonna need access to all of Anton's office files.
of course.
I can take care of that right now.
specializing in long-term backup of data.
don't let your memories...
why, hello there, Dorian-0167.
good day, Dorian.
replace your worn-out objects with new...
Hey, DRN-01...
Kira, I need you to think.
were there any new people in his life?
he doesn't know a lot of people outside of work.
anything out of the ordinary?
he'd been meeting with a headhunter.
was he looking to change jobs?
no, when you have skills like-like Anton, you have options.
do you remember the name?
he, uh...
it was a woman.
I think her name was Natalie.
she worked for a recruitment company called Kinsey.
your company makes real-time tracking software for personalized advertising.
Yeah.
I think I know how Anton Cross was killed.
Anton's software exploits an obscure bug in the location-tracking protocols used by nearly all sensors, phones, cameras, retinal scanners, bio-stamps, even DNA readers, enabling them all to communicate in real time to precisely track virtually any person at any time.
so Anton created the guidance system for the bullet?
Dorian, are you there?
hang on, it's Rudy.
I have some information about where the bullet came from.
according to Interpol, the MEMS circuit in the slug was a Russian Army design.
a batch was stolen from a Ukrainian armory three months ago.
and the theft was linked to a group called Revolution Now.
a new weapon for the black market.
self-guided bullets that can track down and kill anyone.
Rudy thinks the MEMS in the bullet that killed Anton were stolen by gunrunners.
so, Anton sold his software to arms dealers.
and they killed him with it.
what a world.
the round was fired miles away.
it's a lot of money.
don't you see what we have here?
it's worth it.
when can I get it?
soon.
I want to see it work for myself.
follow me.
we'll use her.
have to kill her anyway.
so Anton sells his genius tracking software to arms dealers.
who take it and use it to create a guidance system for a new kind of bullet that can track down anyone wherever they are.
and once they get what they needed from Anton, they kill him with it.
so, how do we know they haven't mass-produced them already?
we don't.
well, they just killed the man who designed the guidance system.
they wouldn't have done that unless R & D was already done.
we need to find these dealers and contain this.
we've already notified FBI and DHS.
I'll check Anton's financials.
maybe we can find out who he sold the software to.
but I'm not optimistic-- he was in tech.
he'd know how to hide money.
I'd be happy to help, Detective Stahl.
don't stress yourself, bot.
there's an easier way.
your daddy's really good at hiding money, right?
why don't we just ask him how it's done.
stand up when you say that.
Oh, wait, you are.
Yeah, well, my parents didn't have the money to make me taller.
or pretty.
even if you were genetically enhanced, Richard, you would only be a taller jerk.
Anton's girlfriend said he'd been meeting a headhunter from a company called Kinsey.
it was the only new thing in his life.
all we have is her first name-- Natalie.
can you check it out?
there are no Natalies currently employed by Kinsey.
maybe Kira got the name wrong.
or maybe she's lying.
let's go ask her.
hang on.
we know you were after something in the evidence vault when you assaulted the precinct with Insyndicate.
are we really gonna go through this again?
what was it?
asked but not answered.
the same as the last 50 times.
this time, it's different, Reinhardt.
this time,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
you tell us what is here, and we make a deal.
you're asking for a big piece of information.
for that, I get a full walk.
that's not gonna happen.
it's worth it.
so close, and yet so far away.
that must be frustrating.
isn't that right, buddy?
your girlfriend Anna would be very impressed to see you walk me around.
you do know that's not her real name?
wouldn't you just love to get your hands around that chick's throat?
I know where she is.
would you like to know?
how bad?
get her to let me walk.
we're gonna find her.
and we're gonna find what you were after anyway.
Yeah, eventually, I guess.
if you get enough time.
but, um, do you really think that I'm the only one coming for it?
get him out of here. Thanks.
all right, let's go.
were you really gonna offer him a deal?
one I could live with, yeah.
a deal you could live with.
but what about the families of the 11 men killed in the ambush?
and the men who died in the assault?
could they live with it?
I've been working this nonstop to try to figure it out for them.
so you negotiate with a murderer?
what are you afraid is in here?
something even worse.
here you go.
Kira.
we need to talk.
we suspect Anton was selling your company's tech to people who killed him with it.
the headhunter you mentioned-- Natalie?
we checked at Kinsey, she doesn't exist.
you sure you got her name right?
no, I'm not absolutely sure.
how did you get her name?
I bumped into them on the street near our office.
a couple weeks ago.
they were coming back from lunch.
she had blonde hair,
slavic accent.
Anton introduced her.
could you identify her if you saw her?
I think so, yes.
John...
what?
I thought you said it never missed.
you okay?
걱정마시고친구。
보기보다심하지않아。
괜찮아。
please remain still.
thank you for your cooperation.
and remember: hugs, not drugs.
stay on this side of the wall and respect authority.
how are your functions?
you okay to continue?
괜찮아요。
복부만 있으면。
fantastic.
Hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay.
you're safe in here, Kira.
this truck is made of titanium.
they can't track you in here.
I'd be dead if it weren't for you.
thank you.
천만네요。
Kira, you must know something about Anton.
that's why they tried to kill you.
I don't.
if you're holding anything back, now is the time to tell us.
I don't. I don't know anything.
I don't know why they would want me dead, too.
okay.
we're gonna transfer you to a safe house, a place where you can't be tracked.
I'm not going anywhere without my daughter.
my best friend Janet has her.
I need to go see her right now.
she'll worry if I don't go home.
okay. We'll bring her to you. What's her name?
Aimee.
I can't find her. She's not coming up.
Aimee! - Mommy!
I love you so much!
Oh, bless you.
we've got men outside.
you'll be safe here.
for now, maybe, but they will find me. You have no idea that's what this technology is designed to do.
I've seen what this technology can do.
Kira, I need you to be honest with yourself.
is there any part of you that doubts Anton?
well...
Yes. - Why?
because of how secretive he was about where he was going and who he was with.
why didn't you tell me this before?
because I didn't want to believe it.
whatever he was involved with, look what he's done to us.
he was like a father to her.
how could he do this to us?
what if I got scrubbed?
I could go to a scrubber... Kira...
...and erase everything I know about Anton.
whatever they think that he told me,
I could have him extracted.
that might make sense to you now, but...
I need to be here for her. She's all that I've got.
and then maybe they'll leave me alone when I'm no longer a threat to them.
it doesn't work like that. It wouldn't matter.
look, forgetting Anton is not the answer here.
are you one of those anti-scrubbers or something?
I don't agree with scrubbing.
well, maybe if your life depended on it, you would.
you have more faith in the tech finding you than me stopping it. I understand that.
but I need you to trust me.
can you guarantee that you can protect us?
no.
look, I know you're worried about your daughter, but if this technology gets out, it'll change the world we live in.
it'll change the world that she lives in forever.
you know something.
we just gotta figure out what it is.
but I can promise you that my partner and I will do everything we can to protect you.
what do you need me to do?
눈이 이상해。
롬도 못하겠어。
지금 우리 한테 와야해。
what's wrong with him?
sure, you got it.
captain approves. We're on.
please make him stop.
it's a Korean pop song.
I find it catchy and soothing.
Rudy, if you don't do something about this,
I'll shoot him, too.
thank you.
so, you're using the young woman as bait?
Yeah. Kira's comm signals are down.
she's off the grid.
we're gonna move her from the safe house, put her somewhere underground, turn the comms back on.
put her back on the grid?
draw the arms dealers to us.
um, perhaps, do you need any undercover help?
does this in any way, even tangentially, involve sexbots?
because I am quite willing... - Yeah, you know what, Rudy?
we're, um... we're good. Thanks.
Kennex. - Hey, it's me.
Hey, how are you?
I got something for you.
Really? For me? Uh, that's sweet.
you, uh... you shouldn't have.
I meant on the case.
I have something for you on Anton.
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, I, uh... I knew that. - Uh-huh.
what do you got?
Anton Cross's car has parking violations outside Merit Bank.
once, three weeks ago, and then again a week after that.
we checked surveillance, and he did go inside the bank.
now, there was no account under his name, but there was one under a "Mark Cross."
mark is Anton's middle name.
that's it. That's the money trail.
did you find the money he got for selling the software?
no, there was no money in the account, but there was a safe-deposit box.
maybe the money's in there.
I'm gonna send you the address now.
okay, great. Thanks, Val. We'll check it.
here you go. - Thanks.
no bitcoins.
wasn't hiding any money.
a lot of personal effects.
what do you make of this?
there's numbers on 'em.
some sort of code.
a password maybe.
video chip.
it's full.
play it.
we can get to her at any time.
I think you know that.
don't make a mistake that can't be undone.
Kira...
do you think this will work?
can they protect you?
deliver the third part of the design schematic by Thursday.
there will be no more time.
Anton wasn't facilitating an arms deal.
he was being extorted.
where is Kira Larsen?
John? - What?
I just received notification that Kira Larsen has left the secure building five minutes ago.
she's gone.
look, these guys aren't gonna stop until they find Kira.
until we find her, the only lie we have left to chase is Natalie.
Anton lied about her for a reason.
Kira said she saw them outside and near their office two weeks ago coming back from lunch.
yeah?
well, we know what Anton and Kira look like.
so why not use facial recog to search for them and another woman in the vicinity of their office a couple weeks ago?
there's a lot of faces in the city.
there's something you need to see.
DHS was able to pull this off a black site which they were able to trace back as far as Estonia.
the language is Chechen.
with a maximum range of two kilometers, the magic bullet can locate a single human target with an accuracy of 25 centimeters.
fast, precise, and with little or no risk to operator exposure, the magic bullet is also a bargain at the designated price per round.
tie up a loose end and make an infomercial out of it.
that's pretty cool.- Cost-effective.
captain, we just intercepted a signal from Kira Larsen's personal comm.
bring it up.
looks like Kira went with your plan.
okay, now what?
now we wait.
all right.
got her.
but she's underground.
the bullet can't reach her.
we'll have to go get her.
she still hasn't moved.
3435 Randall Avenue.
what's listed at 3435 Randall?
it's listed as a plumbing supply, closed for the last 11 months.
Yeah, there's at least half a dozen memory shops on that block.
bet she's gone to a scrubber.
two lefts, then a right.
Hey, what are you doing?
beat it.
we got to go. We don't have much time.
I want them to find me. I want them to find me!
and when they get here, they can watch me having my memory scrubbed!
I don't know why they're trying to kill me, but I know it's gotta have something to do with Anton!
I told you, if I get rid of everything in my head about him, they'll leave me alone.
it wouldn't matter.
look, we think we know why they tried to kill you.
that woman you saw Anton with, Natalie, we believe she's an arms dealer, and you can identify her.
John.
we need to hurry.
let's go, Kira.
get down!
backup units will be here in another three minutes.
great. That should give them just enough time to kill us.
can you draw their fire?!
go.
mine's still alive.
mine's done.
put your hands up!
police. Put your hands up!
all clear.
Roger, detective.
clear!
we got a code four!
Kira.
get her out of here.
come on. Let's go.
you're all right. - Come with us.
you've certainly taken your fair share today.
I'll send you the bill.
we can get to her at any time.
I think you know that.
don't make a mistake that can't be undone.
deliver the third part of the design schematic by Thursday.
there will be no more time.
where did you get this?
they're threats.
we found the videos in a safety-deposit box Anton had.
Wh-What?
Anton traded his software to protect you.
they needed his expertise, and they used you to get it.
Anton traded his software to save your life and the life of your daughter.
we found these.
do you know what these numbers mean?
he said he would save them, and he did.
when we first met, he wrote down his phone number on a piece of paper with a pen, and...
he was old-fashioned that way.
I ripped it up.
and he said he would win me over...
and that he would keep this as a memento.
we used to write notes to each other in pen.
I can't tell you how happy I am that I can remember that.
I want you to have this.
no, really, I... - Please.
I wouldn't have any of him if it weren't for you.
thank you.
Kira, I'll walk you out.
could you please put that back into evidence? - Mm-hmm.
you know, I have something for you.
for me? - Yeah.
you're pulling my leg.
no, I do this time. I mean it. I do.
it's an energy chew.
Oh, wow. -Yeah.
for me?
I thought you might need it.
you shouldn't have. - I know.
I got something for you.
for me? - Yeah.
paper.
is that a pen?
Wow.
sorry.
uh, thanks for the chew.
thank you.
end of watch.
all synthetics report to charging stations.
ipsec already has a task force up and running.
they're confident they'll be able to plug the location-tracking exploit.
until the next one pops up. - Yep.
John.
thanks for not destroying any MX's today.
Yeah, well...
the night is young.
there are over 6 billion people on planet Earth, ordinary folks like you and me. But if you look around carefully, you might find that some of these ordinary folks
everyone on this unit is just like you.
they are all Alphas.
I hear something. Footsteps running. Three men in pursuit.
take this ticket and eat it.
when I first discovered the Alpha phenomenon,
I was a doctor treating a group of remarkable patients, including my daughter Dani.
people fear what they do not understand or what they cannot control.
the government's solution to the problem is Binghamton, a clandestine prison hospital where Alphas are confined and subjected to experiments without any respect paid to their civil rights or their humanity.
by our keeping the Alpha phenomenon secret, we are following a path which I believe can only lead to violence...
a conflict against a rogue group of Alphas organized by their leader, Stanton Parish.
war. It's inevitable.
nothing that you or I can do to stop that. You'll forgive me if I try.
I am calling for transparency.
an end to secrets.
Alphas exist. They are among us.
they are our friends and our spouses. This is what we have been hiding...
I warned you. - Security! Get him out of here.
the secret that Stanton Parish so badly wants concealed.
and by sharing this truth, it will become evident that it's time for everyone to open their eyes, to open their minds, and to open
I see you've been picking your cuticles again.
I suspect it's this place.
being here, day in and day out, must be incredibly stressful for you.
I find yoga and meditation particularly efficacious in an environment like this.
what about the drugs? Do they help?
you should try some and see for yourself.
I'm not psychologically unstable.
Natalie, you are deflecting again.
why are we here, Dr. Rosen?
I could ask you the same question.
I'm here because the government wants me out of the way.
shelved.
for exposing the Alphas phenomenon.
delusions of persecution.
classic symptom of paranoia.
I am not delusional.
though I am being persecuted.
Lee, you know how this goes.
you can deny your issues, or you can commit to therapy and maybe I can help.
Oh, please.
we both know my fate has nothing to do with these sessions.
hour's up.
talked to my boy, Doc. You were right, it was the stuff with the dog.
well, I'm glad I could help.
children mourn differently than we do, remember that.
be patient and encourage him to express himself.
we're working on it. That's your stop.
Yes, indeed it is.
Lemme get that for you.
you okay, Doc?
no, William. I'm not okay.
I've been here eight months.
eight months wasted. I have important things to do.
patients, clients. I need to get out of here.
sorry, Doc. Wish I could help.
Alphas? Do you seriously believe in that crap?
world is filled with surprises.
how much longer we gotta be here? You in a rush?
trying to get home to watch Storage Wars?
tip said sometime today.
well, this muzak is killing me. I'm tired of reading deodorant labels.
you could always switch to hemorrhoid cream.
douchebag.
that would be aisle three, Hicks.
Yeah.
it's on!
cover the exits!
back corner!
she's an Alpha! She tapped into the cables!
pull her loose!
everybody down! This is a robbery!
surprise. You're not the only one.
drop it!
I said drop it!
Hicks, cover your ears!
let's go!
Meg, we're leaving! - Uhh!
Hicks! Get the rest.
Hey, Hicks! Get 'em.
take 'em down!
we got two males headed west on 43rd, silver pick-up, no rear plate.
yo, Harken.
what's up, Hicks?
I can't spell worth a crap.
what is it, "u" before "e" except after... You kidding me?
you know there's a spell-check on that thing?
what, your adrenals kickin' your ass?
you're kinda looking a little pasty there. I mean, for you.
don't hate. Appreciate. Okay?
besides, which one of us actually caught someone and which one of us shot and killed a parking meter?
friggin' meter had it coming.
sorry, I kinda screwed the pooch. Don't blame yourself.
you want to blame somebody, you blame Cley. Some damn intel, please?
is that too much to ask, ya know?
Hey, freaks, F. Y. I. you might want to bring some earplugs.
besides, we still bagged one out of three, which is more than I can say for Cley and his boys.
just take it easy on Cley, man.
I mean, he's a Pittsburgh Pirates fan. He suffers enough.
that's a self-inflicted wound. Dude is still in there.
he couldn't get a Girl Scout to confess her favorite cookie.
that's Megan Bates. So look, "neuro-diversity.
you have been logging into that chat room, haven't you?
helping Alphas, right?
that's part of our job? I'm tellin' you, there's a lotta people in that chat room, they got questions.
that chat room is filled with pimply-faced teenagers pretending to be Alphas.
you're probably the only real Alpha on there.
maybe.
Gary goes on there sometimes.
Really? - Mm.
has he logged in lately?
his mother left a voicemail yesterday, saying, uh...
he stopped calling. Nothing for two weeks.
no, I haven't heard from him.
shoulda never let Cley assign Gary to the N. S.A.
Yeah, well, it's not like we had a choice.
look, I'll rattle their cage, remind them to let him call home.
C'mon, what are you doing?
no, no coffee. What are ya doing? C'mon.
look.
you drop dead of a heart attack, I'm on my own.
we're a team. Look, I hate to break it to you, but without Rosen, there is no team.
daddy... so loud.
it's a beautiful day. You haven't left the house in months.
you quit your job, you move back home, fine.
but hiding in your room? Jumping at every sound?
Rachel, don't tune me out.
please, Baba, I'm just tired, okay?
I found you a new therapist. - No.
Rachel, he can help.
baba, there's only one person that I've ever trusted, and he's gone, so please... okay?
I just want to rest.
have a wonderful day now...
and that's an order. They say there's no such thing as Alphas!
but I know! Alphas control the world!
they're everywhere!
Alphas control the world!
they-they put thoughts into my head!
terrible thoughts, beamed into my brain
you!
you need to stop talking.
we don't use beams.
Taxi!
Taxi!
excuse me.
let's share a cab.
it's the wife.
phone doesn't work inside. I'll catch up.
Hicks, what are you doing?
you're not supposed to take that off. Just letting her have some fresh air.
this is Binghamton. No, not just Binghamton.
nice girl like you gets the upgrade.
building Seven? You think I'm scared?
go to hell, traitors.
Hicks, that's why you're not supposed to take that mask off.
thank you, gentlemen.
please wait here while I get her transfer papers.
I hate this place. Well, it's part of the job.
just hold your nose, and think about that government dental plan.
jamming pacifier chips in the back of people's necks?
it's not the job. It's Night of the Living Dead.
what else we gonna do? These people are violent.
and they have abilities. Lethal abilities.
so at least this is humane.
humane? What, like the S. P.C. A?
Alphas are rabid dogs now, is that it?
Megan Bates and her crew pulled off 15 armed robberies, left five people dead.
now she definitely belongs down here.
all of these people who are down here
it is Gary! Gary!
guard!
this is from the National Security Agency in Arlington ten days ago.
and you just found out about this?
N. S.A. won't tell you what color the sky is without formal approval.
we warned you about this when you sent him over there.
Gary's autistic. He's got needs.
he doesn't like to be touched.
Gary's got a set routine, specific food, and needs someone to listen to him talk about cars.
I told 'em. You think they care?
he sent two of their agents to the hospital, they sent him here- end of story.
Hey, Dad? Ah, Dani, hi.
you're early today.
Yeah, yeah, I am. You okay?
Yeah. Yeah, it's just this...
the level of sedation is just completely gratuitous.
Yeah. Let me help.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, that's a little bit better.
I think your visits are the only thing keeping me sane.
so, how's everything in your big bad world?
dad, according to your lawyers, the government is making you look pretty bad.
they brought up the LSD bust, everything that mom said in the divorce papers.
well, I worry them something fierce.
they'll do whatever it takes to discredit me.
well, Dad, they're calling it a history of mental illness.
I don't know if they're ever gonna let you out of here.
no, Dani, they are going to. And soon, I think.
how can you be so sure? Because try as they might, Dani, the government cannot cover up everything.
plus... there's Stanton Parish.
out there somewhere, planning God knows what.
sooner or later, there will be an event- or a series of events
they simply cannot control without me.
so that's what I'm waiting for.
an event.
okay, Miss Bates.
you'll feel a little pinch.
and running final diagnostic.
why don't you just turn the chip off for ten minutes, okay?
so we can find out what happened to our friend.
there's nothing that I can do.
I understand, sir, but it is our belief that Mr. Bell was simply mishandled.
he is a valuable asset. They shouldn't have stuck a chip in his brain!
Yeah, not helping. I'm activating her chip now.
some kind of power surge? Cut the breakers! Cut the breakers!
it's Meg.
when they chipped her, they let her in the whole damn system.
they'll all wake up.
what is that? What the hell is going on?
power loss. Get the guards in.
lock these doors, down. Both sides!
code 12-28 in building seven. Code 12-28 in building seven.
N- no.
Gary. - No.
Gary. Gary, it's me, Bill. - No, no, no.
keep that closed! - Gary, it's me, Bill.
Gary, listen. No. No. No.
Gary, come on. Get up, get up. - No. No.
No! No! No! We got a situation here!
we need backup! No! No! No! No!
go! Gary
agent Harken. I remember you.
you've got a weak heart.
I can stop that.
this is bad.
we gotta get out of here.
you see signals?
Gary, I don't think I can amp up.
so please tell me you see a way out.
come on, partner.
look...
okay, partner,
I'm gonna need you. Okay?
it's time to step your game up.
step
step your game up.
right? Gary.
baby.
I shorted out everything, but the fail-safe doors dropped.
let me in there. I can make a difference. Unless your ability misfires again.
someone turn off that damn alarm!
testing. Testing.
one, two. Testing, mic check.
Sibilance. Sibilance. Hello-o.
Hello, Cornell. This is a formal negotiation, Agent Cley.
you call me Mr. Scipio. We're not negotiating.
release the hostages, or things get worse.
worse than having a chip in my neck?
all right. Wanna play hardball?
please. I have a family.
I got a family too. Don't shoot. We can still talk about this.
I'm not gonna shoot him.
my God, that's Kimi Milard.
next time.
okay, we get the message.
Mr. Scipio, what are your demands?
you know what, I'm actually done talking with you, Cley.
there's only one person I'm willing to negotiate with.
doc, there's been an incident.
I'll fill you in on the ride.
no, Nathan.
that's not the way it's going to work.
you fill me in first, and then, if I decide to help, then we take that ride.
Dr. Rosen. I never thought I'd see you again.
I know.
but I'm here now, and it's because I need you.
which means you have to leave this room.
now, you've been here before. You know what you have to do.
focus on the things that comfort you, tune everything else out, and take a step forward.
so I'm thinking for dinner, there's this little Sushi place on Broadway.
you like Sushi, right? What am I doing here?
I'm supposed to be at work. No.
right now,
you're supposed to be here with me.
so kiss me. Okay?
tell me I'm beautiful.
Oh, you're beautiful.
go home.
what do you want?
because I have things to do.
Nina, Gary's in trouble. He needs us.
Gary, I should have never let Cley loan you out to the N. S.A.
I know that now.
I just thought I needed to do whatever it took to show that we were still valuable without Rosen.
and I overstepped.
Gary, I'm trying to apologize right now.
do you hear me? Gary, do you hear
that was-that was too loud.
right. That was-that was dumb.
I just...
Gary, I'm sorry.
he's here. - What
Hey, Rache. - Hicks.
so you came.
I'm here for Gary, not you. Right.
what happened between the two of you?
I woke up. - Yeah? Is that what you call pushing everyone you meet? You need help.
you feel like jumping off a building?
Nina. - Please, both of you.
you can discuss how much you care about each other later.
right now, there are things I need each of you to do while I'm out of contact.
out of contact?
doc, you know, you...
put a lot of these guys in there.
now, what if all they wanna do is get their hands on you, huh?
well, if that's the case, this will all be over shortly.
I'll do what I can in there, and I'll relay what I discover to the three of you, via Rachel.
but if for some reason I can't defuse the situation, then, Cameron...
right. We play cavalry.
Yes. At the right moment. And only if absolutely necessary.
clear.
Rachel? I'm in.
I don't see anyone so far.
if I bump into any invisible Alphas, I'll let you know.
it's deserted, but I hear footsteps.
I'm here to talk.
I'm not.
Hello, Ted.
you asked me a lot of questions before you threw me in here.
how I see weak spots, what they look like to me.
still curious?
that's your radial nerve.
touchy, isn't it?
I see Building Seven hasn't diminished your abilities any.
this man is our guest.
I'm sorry about that.
Dr. Rosen? Cornell Scipio.
welcome to the monkey house.
????
Hey, Dr. Rosen's asking to see Bill and Gary. Scipio's not going for it.
there's a banging...
it's faint, but it's regular.
Scipio's voice just got angrier.
he wants to know how Dr. Rosen can justify putting them in there.
how they've been treated. We are still in building seven.
we are rotting. Yes, I understand your frustration.
you all are being treated deplorably.
and... I want to change that.
that's one of the main reasons I went public with the Alphas situation in the first place. That's why I am here.
I- I wa-I want to help.
you wanna help.
okay...
tell me-tell us why we're so screwed up.
you are not screwed up.
if anything, you are all extremely gifted.
C'mon. I set things on fire.
I make people's skin sizzle.
let's face it, they're never gonna let us out of here.
I'm a mistake. We are all mistakes.
maybe we all belong in a cage.
and here comes the line about how there are no mistakes. We're all just people.
kumbaya. No.
actually Dr. Rosen isn't giving him any sympathy at all.
your ability isn't the mistake.
the mistake is how you- you choose to use it.
Yes. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
what in my brain makes me different?
Can-hey- can I turn it off?
you really want to talk about this right now.
Yeah.
can't hear a damn thing.
I get up at 7: 42.
What'd you say? Get up
I get up at 7: 42. Brush my teeth.
dress myself appropriately in shirt and pants. Right.
you have to wear pants, even if they're uncomfortable.
it's important to wear pants when you leave the house.
right.
it's important to wear pants, and it's important to interact with people. Right, Gary?
I get up at 7: 42. Brush my teeth.
and I dress myself- Gary. No, Gary.
whenever you are stressed or you feel threatened your sweat glands produce two chemicals that when combined combust.
Oh, so I'm combustible.
that's... cute.
but, uh, actually, at the moment you seem quite calm, despite your condition.
which strikes me as, um...
a bit odd, given the situation we're in right now.
is this a delaying tactic, Mr. Scipio?
no, no, no, no, no, my questions matter.
cause if I'm a mistake and I can't change that, where does that end?
a mistake isn't human, a mistake is...something else. A "them."
us versus them.
and I don't get to choose whose side I'm on.
that, uh... sounds like something coming from Stanton Parish.
Stanton Parish, where's that? Somewhere near Baton Rouge?
baby?
we're ready.
ready for what?
what's going on? I was right.
th-this has all been a ruse.
listen to me, Cornell. There is no "us" or "them."
you are not a mistake.
thinking that way is the mistake, and- and you can prove it to yourself, you can prove your humanity. Just let these hostages go, and I promise
you know what, Rosen, I've enjoyed our little chat, but, um... It's time for the main event.
Where's he taking him?
whoa, whoa, what happened?
all right, you two, it's time.
we need eyes. I gotta get inside.
Cley, go now! - Go, go, go!
move! Move!
time's up.
What're they doing?
no... Oh, my God. Somebody's gotta stop him.
Hicks, they just shot a guard.
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
Y- you- you can't do this.
I can do all sorts of things.
go, go, go!
Oh, my God.
I can't think! We need, uh- we need an ambulance, we need a pararamedics!
it's wrong. It's all wrong.
I don't smell the burning. Okay?
the yelling, the screaming, it's- it's only on the monitors.
you okay? - I'm okay.
Hicks! Hicks, can you hear me?
it's all fake. Fake. Rachel's saying it's all fake.
Hicks, I'm hearing something upstairs. Come on, this way!
move, move, move! Let's go!
she's hacked into the security feed.
maybe she faked the whole thing. She painted pictures with the ones and zeros to lure us in here.
Where'd they go?
too late. You lose.
Hicks. I'm still hearing the banging.
Ted Asher, he, uh- he finds the weak spots, right?
Rachel, where is that banging coming from?
it's the southeast corner. He was punching his way out.
come on, move!
it's not gonna do you any good if you- Just be quiet!
not you. You're not one of us.
I can't-oh, my God- Rachel, Rachel, no, Rachel, look at me. Okay?
Nina... You're not scared.
you are completely focused.
cornell, let Bill and Gary go.
you don't need them. You don't need hostages anymore.
you've proved your humanity already!
I'm not human. I'm an Alpha.
please don't do this!
doc!
Cameron! They've taken Bill and Gary.
we've got to stop them, Cameron.
which one?
get up at 7: 42. I get up at 7: 42.
I swear to God, shut him up. He doesn't shut up in the back of the car.
second from the front. They're in the backseat.
take the shot, Hicks.
cameron, it's just like throwing a quarter.
just like throwing a quarter.
God.
no... No!
Gary. Thank God.
lie down. Lie down. Lie down.
bill, deep breaths. Deep breaths, Bill.
good job, bill.
good shot, Hicks.
Asher's out cold.
Where's Scipio?
he's gone.
let's face it, Nathan, you can't control the Alphas situation.
you haven't found Parish yet, and you, or whomever else is in charge, can't cover this up forever.
for the past eight months you've been fighting a losing battle.
look, what happened in Building Seven, it was bad.
but those hostages came out alive. You and your team made that happen.
Yeah, we did what we could. Listen.
why don't you just tell me what you want to tell me?
we need you.
we need you to pull your team back together, and deal with the Building Seven escapees, and keep a lid on this entire mess.
well, why didn't the government think of that before they institutionalized me?
the government is 100, 000 feudal kingdoms all fighting for money and control.
sure, you got some enemies in D. C. but you got some friends, too.
and what are these friends offering me?
a full pardon. A cause. And a fat consulting fee.
it'll be just like the old days.
Ah, you know, there's a reason they call them the old days, is because they are old.
Lee, I got you a sweet deal here.
take it.
or you'll end up back in your rubber room.
all right, so, if uh, you or whomever wants me back, I need to run the program.
I decide what happens to the Alphas we locate.
I approve of the assignments, and with no interference.
or I'm out.
Hey, Gary. My mom's hummus.
your favorite. Rachel, he's not a dog, okay?
he doesn't respond to treats. Dogs don't like hummus.
do they, Gary?
I thought you said he was talking. Yeah, he was.
you know, Gary-babble, but... after the crash, not a peep.
I figured if you bring him to us
familiar surroundings- he'd feel something, or
maybe he just needs some time, okay, just to get adjusted.
come on, Gary. Gary, c'mon, look. Gary.
C'mon now, look around here. All right? Look.
everybody's here.
you're back at work. What do you do?
you greet your co-workers appropriately, right?
so, come on. Come on, greet me.
come on, you bastard, greet me. Look, I'll let you drive- no.
you're-you're on the right track. Still, um...
may I?
he's all yours.
I, uh, understand why you're not, uh, greeting everyone.
uh, greetings usually happen at 9: 00 a. m.
uh, so, now it is, uh, 3: 14.
now, we're not on a case.
what do you usually do around 3: 14?
okay, this is hopeless. He's exactly the same way as he was when we first met him. Don't say that.
wait, wait wait, wait. He just
he just looked at me. You see that?
Gary, let's imagine today. All right?
you, uh... You got up at 7: 42.
you brushed your teeth, as
as usual, and then you- you got dressed, you know?
shirt, socks, shoes, pants, right?
right. You gotta wear pants, because that's important, right? Mmhmm.
and then you, uh, went downstairs, you got breakfast, and then you came in. And you greeted everyone. Um...
and then you worked, uh, you had lunch, and now it is, uh- well, you've been here all day.
so, what do you normally do then?
she's worried about you, Gary. She hasn't heard from you.
what are you going to do?
this is Sandra Bell. Leave a message. No, it's the voicemail.
I'll call you back. - I hate the voicemail.
mom! I'm at the office, and I'm fine.
I don't have a chip in my head anymore. Okay, bye.
Gary- - I-no, don't do that.
no, Bill, get off me! - There you go. C'mon!
you called me a bastard. That's not nice. You tell 'em, Gary.
Yeah, uh- Bill, you know what? You're the bastard.
you're right. You left me with N. S.A.
and they made me spy on my friends.
and then-and then, they wouldn't answer when I greeted them appropriately.
and they put me in Building Seven, Bill. And you just left me there.
you all left me there.
Yes, Gary, uh- that's right. W- w-I did.
and, uh, that was a mistake. Yeah! Mistake.
but, now, we are going to make them right.
all of us.
together.
we, uh... We stored a few things in your office while you were gone.
I'm-I'm gonna help you get 'em out.
all right? Okay.
Thanks. Wait. Hicks, why are you
what kinds of things? Smelly things?
I'm glad to have you back. Yeah. No, don't do that. I don't like that.
too bad.
it's a little dramatic, don't you think?
holding a meeting in the wasteland?
sentimental, actually.
marched through here during the war. It was orchards then.
all the way to the river.
now it's a pit.
Yeah, people really do screw everything up, don't they?
the smokestack has ever waged war on the apple tree.
we'll put an end to that.
better people, better world.
how's your father?
he's free. Like you said. I just got the call.
good.
such injustice, him rotting away in there.
I'm glad that he can benefit from our efforts.
still...
miles to go before we sleep.
let's get to work.
24 contestants remain in the competition.
all of them are praying they're through to the next round.
four of them will be leaving this stage tonight, you cast the votes.
what did you decide?
we're live.
this is "american idol.
from the thousands who entered the competition these are the faces left fighting.
it took struggle.
it took dedication.
and it tood talent.
but tonight, they're going to find that making the top 24 is one thing.
staying in it is another.
from hollywood, get ready for the emotion and the action.
this is all unfolding live.
welcome to "american idol.
my name is ryan seacrest, and it's time to get serious.
you saw the girls' group perform on tuesday.
the guys' group performed last night.
almost 40 million votes came in, and based on your input, the bottom two from each group will be eliminated within the next hour.
and these are the three people who put the contestants on this stage tonight.
give it up for your judges
and simon cowell.
how wonderful to see the panel again.
Randy, you've talked about likability quite a bit this season.
how much weight is there in the likability?
when you look at the whole equation.
how much weight does that actually carry do you think with the audience?
I think it carries quite a bit.
I mean the audience is seeming, you know, seem to be listening to what we say about the singing.
but sometimes it's kind of right not just about singing.
it's about having a little something special with the "it" factor.
Yeah, does it shift as we move on?
does likability mean less to the end of the competition?
I think so. once we get to the top 12, you have to bring it every night.
it needs to be the bomb every time you step foot on this stage.
you know, paula, it's interesting. it seems like season after season.
why do you think that is?
I think we've gained a larger audience.
XXXXXXXXXX both younger and older.
and it is the greatest show on television.
but what do you think is special about this group?
I've said before they are not all your typical "american idol" contestants.
Yeah, but each one of them can pierce the heart strings of america.
Xxxxxxxxxxx -well not every one.
uh, simon. keep your opinions to yourself with respect and i'll say what i feel.
I think each and every one of them brings something to
you need it -shut up. -any way.
it's back to where you can be.
but listen. he's going to be try and be tough in his baby blue sweater tonight.
that's a hot color, ryan. -but speaking of my friend, simon
W are you obsessed whatway wear?
at least one person it is.
but it's verging on creepy.
I definitely look up to the elderly.
um, do you
that could be misconstrued.
no, you are very wise and mature. i want to ask do you want do you want me to send you a photo?
maybe just a statue.
do you think that -- back to business mr. cowell.
do you think it is obvious who is leaving us tonight?
Yes.
why do you think it's so obvious?
because they were terrible.
but what about if they were likable?
well, there are one or two who went beyond that no matter how likable you are.
there were some great performances over the two nights and some horrible prmances.
and i think that we have now trained the american audience to be good music critics.
I haven't heard him say we before.
he always says i have trained
collectively.
all right, before we break up the happy family.
here theyll are performing for you live.
it's something none of them will actually be able to do tonight.
take it easy." take it away.
well i'm a runnin' down the road tryin' to loosen my load i've got seven women on my mind four that wanna own me two that wanna stone me one says she's a friend of mine take it easy don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy lighten up while you still can don't even try to understand just find a place to make your stand and take it easy well i'm a standin' on a corner in winslow, arizona and such a fine sight to see it's a girl my lord in a flat bed ford slowin' down to take a look at me come on baby don't say maybe i gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me we may lose and we may win though we will never be here again so open up i'm climbin' in so take it easy oh we got it easy we oughta take it easy oh we got it easy welcome back to "american idol.
before the break, the top 24 showed us how well they work as a group, but the harmony is about to come to an abrupt halt.
before we split them up and start with the eliminations, let's see how this all came together with the performance shows. watch this.
first it was the girls.
then it was the guys with only 12 spots available.
all 24 came to win.
some tried to rock their way into the top 12.
I thought it was cool. i thought it was a cool choice for you.
I think we are going to see you all the way through to the finals of this show.
you are a true making of a star.
others tried a country twist.
I think this is a shining moment for you.
some drew inspiration from the stars of the vegas strip like bobby who took on barry.
david who took on "queen.
and paris who took on gladys.
elliott got the judges fired up with his stevie wonder song.
you are the best male vocalest we've ever had.
but when brenna took on the same artist
things got a little heated.
that was horrible.
you are like a wild little cat.
and someone's just put gloves on you.
you want me to bring the boys back out.
they will come back out. -i welcome them.
both nights there were some great performances.
you got it going on.
you are 16.
and from start to finish, you are a star.
and there were some high notes from the girls.
and the guys.
this is real. we got a hot one tonight.
and with simon around, you know there had to be some lows.
it was horrible, actually.
vocally, it was completely and utterly average.
it was verging excruciating.
your smile bothers me.
but after all that, both nights ended in style.
and with smoldering looks.
you are absolutely going to sail through to the next round.
it was really, really good.
you were the best.
unfortunately, two guys and two girls are going home.
who is it going to be, america?
great shows, great performances, another round of applause for this group.
but, inevitably we do have to lose a whole bunch of folks.
and four people live tonight.
two of which are seated on this stage.
give it up to the girls. say hello to mandisa.
katharine and heather and stevie.
and brenna.
speaking of brenna, let's just start with you.
um, you know, it's interesting to chat with the contestants on results day, because many of them are shy, and they have the butterflies, and they are nervous, i don't think brenna is quite like that.
how do you feel rolling into this show as we sit live on national television?
I think you just have to be like a duck, ryan.
like a duck? -like a duck.
you have to be calm on the surface.
but paddle like crazy underneath.
so i'm paddling.
so, again, how do you feel?
like a duck.
um, i understand paris you actually had a dream about "american idol" is that right?
I did. -tell us about that dream.
okay, so i was asleep. and you know how at the end on the finals.
when there's a lot of confettiy.
I was sleeping and i couldn't see who it was through the confetti, so i need to know who that is.
I know but then i had to be up to be here.
so you missed the ending. hopefuy you are in there somewhere.
I will be.
Heather, let me ask you about the dynamic with the group this morning at breakfast and while we were at the studio doing rehearsals.
did we eat breakfast? i didn't remember.
is it possible to eat food?
a little muffins. they sure do give us our muffins.
what's the breakfast table chat like?
well, nerves always play a part.
I think this morning we are okay.
but we are nervous as heck now.
well this is for the whole group. who is feeling it the most right now.
who is really feeling it? you are?
why are you feeling it the most.
because nobody faced.
and there's a million reasons why you think you will make it and a million reasons why you think you won't.
let me explain to you the theory of the duck.
no, we don't have enough time.
uh, okay, ladies.
as you know we have to shoot the gears and get serious.
two of you will be leaving us live tonight on "american idol.
let's start now looking for the least number of votes.
that girl who polled the least number of votes.
back row, would you please stand up?
and katharine.
none of you have the lowest-number of votes.
you may be seated.
now let's head to the bottom row.
ladies, good luck.
you sang.
you sang "to where you are,
you sang "when the lights go down.
KINNIK, you sang becky, you sang brenna, you sang heather, stevie, and melissa, you do not have the lowest number of votes.
now, if you would stand up and join me at the center of the stage, please, ladies.
I can hear you saying aww, i know, i know.
we don't make it easy, that's for sure.
one of you has the lowest number of votes.
brenna, you will find out with the rest of us who it is after the break.
welcome back to "american idol.
live, it is the moment of truth for the girls' group.
they are up first tonight.
I have brenna, becky, and kinnik standing here in the center of the stage.
one of you has the lowest number of votes in the girls' group.
first let's start with what the judges said about you.
KINNIK, you sang "get here.
Randy said you gave the performance a six out of ten.
Paula liked your showwomanship and power in your voice.
Simon thought you were elegant and regal but thought your performance was a bit cabaret.
Becky, you sang "because the night.
you surprised randy. he enjoyed it.
Paula liked the way you commanded the stage and charmed the audience.
Simon gave you a six out of ten.
6. 5,i think i rounded it to seven, his words, six out of ten.
brenna, you sang "you are the sunshine of my life.
Randy missed seeing your attitude on stage.
Paula liked seeing a softer side.
Simon thought it was, this is his word, horrible.
we are looking for the girl with the lowest number of votes.
you may have a seat.
your homeys huh, your buddies? -we're roommates.
how tough is this?
this is going to be hard.
what would you like to say to each other before you hear the news?
good luck.
good luck brenna -thank you.
you may also have a seat.
which means becky, you leave us tonight. on the american idol.
that's okay.
Becky, ladies and gentlemen.
you all right? -yeah.
this really is the toughest part of every season when we get to these moments and we've got to let you guys go.
now judges, as you sit here and look at becky, we've had several months now together when you think back to the auditions.
what would you like to say to her as she leaves? randy?
I think you have to keep working it out.
I think you still have to find your voice where it really works best.
I think that song was a little above you.
the one duh the other night.
and it's got to be great every night.
every night's got to be the best.
these nights are tough for paula too. i can see tears in her eyes.
this is my least-favorite night.
one thing i will say is that i think you have a career ahead of you.
keep working on the music.
I think casting directors need to take a good look at you because the camera loves you.
thank you.
I would agree. i think you are going to be a very successful model.
and it's best to be great at something rather than not so good as something else.
from one model to another. thank you very much.
and as always, we are going to ask you to sing your song one more time, live.
ladies and gentlemen
I also want to thank "american idol.
just because they have presented so many opportunities and have opened hopefully a lot of doors.
and that was unbelievable of them.
so i wanted to thank everyone at "american idol" and everything.
here we go. becky o'donohue, take it away.
Becky, well done.
looked like you had fun doing that, actually.
I always do.
thank you for everything. great spirit on the show.
all right, one of the girls down.
we have a lot more coming up.
this is what happens when you don't support the one that you like.
the guys are next and they are in the red room.
you are not fooling anyone.
we can sense the nervousness, and we will bring them down right after the break.
stay with us. live on "idol.
welcome back to "american idol." we are live.
if you've just tuned it, we had to say good-bye to becky o'donohue.
now if she is your favorite and you didn't vote.
that should remind you how important it is to get off the sofa and make that call.
we'll be back with the girls in just a few.
but now, time for the gentleman to face the music.
say hello to the guys.
and we have ace.
and elliott.
a round for the gentlemen tonight.
elliott, you heard some pretty cool things from the judges in that performance show.
does that give you the edge the confidence that you think you need in this competition?
I mean honestly. it was definitely a confidence booster.
but if you all remember i think the correct words were potential.
which always, i mean in my eyes
is that the operative term for you?
no, that's what was said.
so potential means there's always room for improvement.
and i think i was just getting my feet wet.
and i got the first performance under my belt.
but yeah, there's always room for improvement.
and you know, i just have to kind of take that and use that and turn it into more positive energy.
when all is said and done it's made you more nervous?
the pressure's on, right?
the bar has been raised.
Kev, let me ask you.
what has been the highlight of this journey as you think back?
I'd have to say the highlight of this journey.
maybe one of the highlights of my life was getting my cheeks pinched over there by the ladies.
that was pretty nice.
maybe next time it will be a few kisses.
if i'm lucky.
look at kevin, smooth.
he's working the national television show to plant a little seed.
all right, gentlemen. good luck to you tonight.
let's get into the elimination.
I'm looking for the guy with the lowest number of votes from the performance show.
back row, gentlemen, guys you are all safe.
front row. would you please stand up?
ace, you sang fatherer figure.
elliott, you sang "if you really love me.
both of you please have a seat.
okay, kev, you sang "one last cry.
Chris, you sang "wand dead or alive,
guys, would you please both sit down as well?
which leaves me with bobby and sway.
gentlemen, to the center of the stage.
let's start here with bobby. how you doin'?
Hi, ryan -you okay? -yep.
feelin' all right? -i'm here.
how you doin'?
I'm fine, and you? -cool.
okay, liar.
Bobby you sang "copacabana
Randy said he was entertained by it but thought the vocals needed work.
Paula thought it was a risky song choice but injoyed your showmanship.
Simon thought it was a nightmare that would have barry manilow screaming in horror.
blah, blah, blah. just kidding.
I'm sure barry enjoyed it.
sway, you sang "reasons.
Randy applauded your personality and vocal range.
Paula gave you a standing ovation thought your performance was amazing.

and you are going to find out right now.
Bobby, it's you.
my man.
I like you bobby, -i like you ryan.
you're fun.
I am fun.
why did you say i know?
I gave you the result, you said i know.
well, because i sang "copacabana" for a reason.
my grandma wanted me to do it.
and i did it.
we have a little understanding he was a little rough. but that's okay.
and you know what, i was in the top 24 of "american idol
something that no one back home can ever say.
and you know, i perfoed in front of 30 million people plus and i'm going to have some haters and negativety when i get home.
but no one can say that.
nobody can say that.
congratulations on that.
so just for the record, everything's patched up. the two of you are okay?
we're cool. we're cool.
Paula, quickly. advice for bobby as he leaves?
Bobby, you are showman and you are a joy.

america voted.
Melissa, you are safe.

Paula liked it. you made her listen to the voice.
Simon thought you completely and utterly, messed it up.
Heather, you sang "when you tell me that you love me.
Randy wanted to hear you take more of a chance and show off your voice more.

Simon thought it was forgettable.
Heather and stevie, if you would stand up and join me at the center of the stage.

Stevie, i was a fan of yours.
I just think you picked the wrong song to showcase your first week.
and hafs the chance that you took.
but you are one likable, talented, beautiful girl.
Yeah, paula's right. it was just the wrong song.
I know you were showing a different side of you.

let's start with patrick, you sang "come to my window.
Randy didn't think it was your best performance.
Paula felt you are an amazing performer who is definitely needed in this competition.
Simon thought it was an average performance that didn't show any emotion.
Bucky, you sang "simple man.
Randy liked your vocal tone and song choice paula predicted that we will see you next week and continue to watch you grow right here on this stage.

I'm a big fan of patrick's. a huge fan.
I saw him perform great during auditions.
I'm really sad to see you go.
but i have no doubt in my mind that you are going to sail through making a record.
and we'll be first in line to buy it.
Randy, do you agree?
Yeah, dude. i think you have a bright career ahead of you.
I know that you play and sing. ybit's more kind of about that, you know what i'm saying?
but i think you definitely got it going on.
it probably didn't show as well the only night as it should have.
I agree.
here's a guy with a great attitude. siemen? quickly, what do you say?

shut UP. YOU'RE REALLY ANNOYING ME NOW.
you WANT TO CHANGE SEATS?
you WANT TO CHANGE SEATS? GOOD.
the BIGGER ISSUE OVER BOTH NIGHTS WASN'T SIMON AND PAULA'S LOVE AFFAIR.
it WAS THE CONTESTANTS' SONG CHOICES.
attempted SONG CHOICES. SONG CHOICE.
it WASN'T A SONG CHOICE THAT CONNECTED WITH ME.
TOOEFY FOR ME IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SINGERS IN THE KNOWN WORLD,
and IT'S HARD WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT GREAT TO MAKE IT YOUR OWN.
country MUSIC WAS A POPULAR CHOICE

I'm GOING TO HOLLYWOOD.
I MADE IT.
I LIKE YOU, BRENNA.
I LIKE YOU, TOO, SIMON.
the last time we auditioned in this city, we found a 20-year-old waitress with a dream.
the winner is Kelly Clarkson.
overnight, she became a global superstar.
after six seasons, we're back.
but is any more talent?
or is Kelly the lone star?
this is Dallas.
welcome to Dallas.
we're back in Dallas, Texas.
our mission, to find out if there's any new talent in the lone star state since we've been gone.
everything's bigger in Texas!
we knew it would draw a Texas-size crowd.
and we'd experience the temperatures.
it's hot in Texas.
so hot.
it's Texas hot out here.
you know what? I'm creatin' myself a slip 'n slide in this dress.
that's how hot it is.
but what we didn't expect was to have our first idol baby.
as Antonia Gillem went into labor waiting for her audition.
I just thought that it was more than appropriate to name him "Idol."
but will Dallas also be the birthplace of our next American Idol?
over 13, 000 people would probably argue yes.
Yay.
and every single one of them is ready to party.
well, almost everyone.
Where's Paula?
Where's Paula?
the holding room filled up, the judges finally took their seats, and we were ready to begin all over again.
also making a fresh start was Jessica Brown.
I'm from Longview, Texas, and I'm a stay-at-home mom of two little girls.
is that good?
you want some more?
my life is pretty stable now, but it wasn't always perfect.
I really didn't experiment with drugs in high school.
but when I went to college, that's when things really got out of control.
you know, I remember being a party, and that is when I tried meth the first time.
there was a time in my life I was using meth every day.
it's so hard to think about that because it was a completely different Jessica.
I got into trouble. I got arrested.
and that was my world.
I mean, everything was wrapped up in that drug.
it's amazing that I've come this far from where I was years ago.
the first song that I sang when I'd, like, gone to the recovery group and started singing again was Jesus take the wheel, by Carrie Underwood.
which is really--it really hit home for me.
I couldn't open my eyes because I would cry if I did.
it was such an emotional song.
and I really felt like that songs meant for me.
she's come back to the person she was.
cause she--she--this is her.
this is her.
and she got away for a while, but that's okay.
God brought her back.
I think that if I could stop one person from using, or inspire them not to go down that road, that this whole journey is worth it.
Aww, you're so sweet.
Hi, Jessica.
Hi, how are you all?
good.
how you feeling?
good.
anxious.
Yeah, Jessica Brown, 24 years old, from Longview, Texas. -Yes.
well, you're here now, and it's time for us to hear you sing. What are you gonna sing?
I'm gonna sing I'll stand by you, by the pretenders.
great song.
okay.
thank you very much, Jessica.
nice.
thank you.
well, you made the song interesting.
it was, you know, a good audition.
are they through?
what's going on in there?
I hope they give our daughter a ticket.
they stopped her. We don't know.
a couple of pitchy things going on, but actually not bad.
thank you.
okay, we're gonna vote.
I can't hear.
what do you say, Peyton?
thank you, god!
Oh my gosh. This means so much.
everybody's so emotional right now because they didn't think that I would ever, ever be here.
and so it's really exciting.
she's come a long way, baby.
so Jessica's moving on to hollywood.
but the really impressive moves were going on in the holding room.
my name is Paul Stafford, I'm 25, from Crosby, Texas.
and I am a park attendant.
a typical day is just getting the place cleaned, weeded, mowed.
and then there's dusting off the bases and making the fields look pretty.
as you're sitting there in that park, you're walking behind that about becoming the next American Idol.
you're thinking about breaking away from the park.
you're thinking about being in
Yes. You got that right.
good. You have any moves?
that's decent.
what's up?
how do?
what's goin' on?
how are ya?
just thrilled to be here.
what's your name, please? -My name is Paul Stafford.
okay, Paul, tell me something interesting about you.
well, I'm a member of the American Roller Coaster Enthusiasts.
you love scary rides.
Oh, the scarier the better, that's the way I like it!
you think American Idol's a scary ride?
it's been scary.
but just a lot of fun.
just like a real roller coaster, dude.
have there been ups and downs so far?
uh, ups, downs, loops.
loops?
all right.
what are you gonna sing?
I am going to sing Elliott Yamin's Wait For You.
okay, lovely.
I like the
thank you.
that was a very joyful audition.
thank you, Paula.
have you ever sung that in public?
uh not in public. No, sir.
in front of anyone
um, my family.
they wanted to see how I would do before I would come here.
what did they say?
they said, "Paul, as far as I'm concerned, Two thumbs up."
no, I would say enthusiastic.
Yes, sir.
but I'm afraid this time it's three nos.
Yes, sir.
it's a no, Paul, but we, dawg.
nice meeting y'all.
nice to meet you, baby. was so good to be here.
rock on out there, man. -Two thumbs up.
thank you, sir.
what a nice guy.
nice guy, man.
good dude, man.
Simon didn't come down on me like I thought he would.
so that's always good, 'cause he goes down on just about everybody.
no hard feelings, Paul.
when we return, we're deep in the heart of Texas.
I've never kissed a girl before.
what?
as Dallas unveils its biggest.
I don't want to hear any more of this stupidity.
and brightest stars.
it's a privilege to sing to the whole world.
I got music on my mind.
so why did we return after all these years?
because everything's bigger in Texas!
well, yes.
but since we had such great luck the last time we stopped by, we're also hoping the next singing sensation is somewhere here in Dallas.
could there be another Kelly Clarkson amidst the crowd?
Beth Maddox hopes so.
I love Kelly Clarkson.
she is my American Idol.
all my friends are, like, what are you gonna sing?
I'm, like, take a guess. And they're, Kelly?
I try to compare myself, and I always get disappointed because she's so good.
I'm not her, but I'd love to be like her.
how are you?
what's your name?
what do you do for a living, sweetheart?
I was a singing waitress at a fondue restaurant.
okay.
what are you gonna sing?
beautiful Disaster, by Kelly Clarkson.
do people compare you to Kelly?
definitely, a lot.
do they? -Yes, sir.
okay.
awful.
I have no idea what that was.
okay.
I couldn't understand a word.
it was called beautiful disaster.
well, okay, well we'll stay with the last word on that.
what, you were actually singing at a restaurant?
Yes.
as you were doing what?
serving.
what were your tips like?
about $30 to $90 a table.
a month.
stop it.
Simon, stop it.
okay, Paula?
no, Beth, I'm gonna have to say-- I'm gonna have to pass.
okay.
the vocals are not hot, baby.
it wasn't that hot.
okay.
thank you.
they all said no.
and they said I can't sing worth anything, so.
which one?
all of them.
they actually said my song was a disaster.
not a beautiful disaster. So
but "disaster" was a kind word to describe the next hour of auditions.
it was atrocious.
okay, it's a no.
this isn't going too well, is it?
next.
so we still hadn't found the next Kelly.
but was Elena Whittaker the new Carrie?
so they say you've been compared to Carrie Underwood. Is that true?
I have gotten that-- like how I look.
the, "you look like Carrie Underwood."
but, um-- You think you're cuter, though.
I actually like to think that Carrie Underwood looks like me.
well, I look at it like that.
exactly.
the question is do you sing like her?
I sing country, but I can do so many different styles.
all right, so what you gonna sing?
I'm going to sing Stronger, by Faith Hill.
all right, go for it.
okay.
Cowell, what do you think of Elena?
I think it was a good audition.
I don't think you're as good as you think you are though.
Oh, really? -No.
shoot.
I can do other styles.
I can do Celine Dion.
no, you're a good singer.
thank you.
I just didn't like the latter half of the song that much.
I'm sorry, the what?
the last part of the song.
Oh, okay.
that's okay.
I know what you're saying. There's a heaviness in her voice that, when you power-- I mean, you've got a very good instrument.
you've got a good voice.
thank you.
work on the breathiness of your voice too.
okay.
Yeah, let's wrap this one up.
Randy? -Yes.
Paula? -Yes.
three yeses, you're through.
welcome to Hollywood, girl!
thank you so much.
Congratulations. We'll see you in hollywood.
thank you. -Okay, come here.
you're growing up quickly.
stay with us.
idol rolls on in Dallas after the break.
coming up, romance reaches new heights.
I've never had an intimate relationship with a woman before.
and Dallas hits an all-time low.
get out.
and later, who gets this comment from Simon?
of all the people we've seen so far this year, you're the best.
welcome back to the cattle call auditions in Dallas.
where outside there's still a steady stampede.
but inside I heard things are a bit out of sorts.
clearly, Simon has no appreciation for the romance of Italian opera.
maybe he's more in the mood for the good old-fashioned kind.
this is Bruce.
this is his father.
and this is the story of a very interesting promise.
I'm different from a lot of other guys.
I've never kissed a girl.
and I've never had an intimate relationship with a woman before.
I think I was about 13.
my dad gave me this key here, and he pretty much brought me up and taught me that there's one woman out there for me.
here's the key, and it symbolizes my promise to my future wife.
he has the heart, so he's holding the heart for my future wife right now.
and when we get married, he'll give the heart to her.
and then I'll have the key to her heart.
he hasn't kissed a girl, and he's 19 years old.
even first base?
even first base. -Even kissing?
you run a tight ship.
although, if he meets the girl out in Hollywood, you're gonna be in big trouble.
you don't even want to start me there.
you'll be guiding him, right?
Oh, you don't want that.
okay.
I've kissed a girl today.
what do I need to know about you, Bruce, aside from loving music and wanting to be a singer?
um, I've never kissed a girl before.
what?
Yes.
Really? -I've never kissed a girl.
on purpose?
on purpose, mm-hmm.
Why?
Why?
because I want to save everything for that one special woman.
on my wedding day, that would be my first kiss.
Oh, he's waiting for his wedding day.
so what you singin', Bruce?
go ahead.
for me, almost.
you've got a good voice it's just
I think it's one of those voices, Bruce, that can sound good--okay in the room.
and then you hear it on the radio and through tv, and it doesn't sound great.
a bit shouty. -That's the problem.
I don't see where it says r&b bluesy singer in that one.
I'm just not sure who you are as an artist.
looking for the best.
Randy, yes or no?
no, I gotta say no, dawg.
I don't think you're quite ready yet.
okay. Keep working at it.
I'm gonna have to pass, Bruce. No.
do you guys have any advice?
kiss some girls.
avoid Ryan on the way out.
it's a no.
it's all right, buddy.
close?
it was close. Was close.
he said come back next year and, uh
and so that's what I'll do.
keep working hard, right?
maybe if Bruce does come back next year, he'll return less boy and more man.
hug it out, Bruce. Hug it out.
back inside, it's 1: 30 in the afternoon and the judges are still looking for more Texas talent.
next.
Hi, Pia.
tell us about yourself.
um, I am a model and a musician and I also sing background.
all right, sweetheart, what are you gonna sing for us?
I'm gonna sing I've got to use my imagination by Gladys Knight.
whenever you're ready.
thank you, Pia.
I thought that was a very good audition.
thank you. -I like you.
thank you. -You're interesting.
thank you.
and yet you haven't got the demeanor of a backing singer.
most backing singers who come in here come in like whipped donkeys.
just really kind of like-- With welts on their backs.
you know, and you're confident.
and you're stylish.
thank you. -I like you. A lot.
thank you. -A lot.
I like you too.
Yay.
Yeah, I do. I like you.
I'd love to see and hear where more of your range is.
Yes, definitely.
I love you three.
I think that's a yes, a yes.
you got three yeses.
thank you!
go Pia!
when we come back, a bag of tricks.
I have this collection.
I don't even know how to react.
part of me's sick, part of me's scared.
some treats for the judges.
waste of time.
and an audition you'll have to see to believe as the birdman cometh.
don't tell us anymore.
that's enough.
welcome back. It's afternoon and the Dallas auditions are moving along smoothly.
so far there's been no surprises.
nothing strange or unusual.
but little did we know what our next contestant had hidden in his bag of tricks.
I'm Ryan. -I'm Brandon.
Brandon, good to see you, bro. -You too.
so tell me about yourself, Brann, where you from?
I'm 21 years old and I'm from Lucedale, Mississippi.
which is way south Mississippi.
uh, about 30 minutes from the gulf coast.
cool.
you have any hobbies?
well, uh, actually I have this collection that I have.
ever since about 7th or 8th grade,
I'd get bored and I'd start peeling my fingernails instead of biting them
that's exactly what I thought you were gonna say.
so I figured, well, there's a little pile of them so I guess I'd just break a new record for the most peeled fingernails
well I thought it was hash browns or fingernails.
Yeah, it's pretty gross, but, you know
pretty gross? Disgusting!
I can't stop, you know?
and what, do they get darker with age?
I guess.
that's not great.
where do keep them?
Oh, they're hidden.
well I guess not hidden now, but you know?
I don't even know how to react.
I'm--I'm-- part of me's sick, part of me's scared.
all right, well it's nice to meet you.
good luck.
Yeah, I'm gonna keep mine.
I--I throw mine out.
you want one?
absolutely not.
hello.
I'm Brandon Green.
Brandon Green, how are you?
I'm doing good. How y'all doing?
good. -Okay.
okay, why are you here?
I'm here to be the next American Idol.
I just want to be a positive influence on the people if I become American Idol, unlike some of these other celebrities that have been, you know
Oh, give me some examples. -You want to name some names?
who do you not want to be like?
well, I mean, it's not-- I mean, she's not a guy, you know?
but, like, Britney Spears or you know, Paris Hilton.
all these kinds of people.
right, so you won't be falling out of cars sharing your lack of underwear.
do what now?
it doesn't matter.
and it says here you peel nails.
that's kind of weird.
Yeah, it's pretty gross.
I shouldn't have even told it.
but you know, uh.
you peel fingernails?
Yeah, you know how some people bite 'em or clip 'em or whatever?
I just kind of-- Peel them off.
and you save them in a bag for the past seven years?
it's been a while since I've done it lately, but yeah.
what are you gonna sing?
Oh, good.
funny.
okay, okay, okay.
Simon, what do you think?
forgettable.
I kind of like you.
I like the audition. -You would.
come on, dawg.
I liked it. Come on, dawg!
I liked the audition.
I liked the tone in your voice. You know what I mean?
I know Simon was saying it's a bit karaoke,
but you actually got a good voice in there
just gotta try and
sometimes it goes into the nasal thing a little bit in your upper range, but I think you got a good voice though, dawg.
Brandon, you gotta make eye contact.
okay.
don't be afraid of us.
Simon of course, but me and Paula, we're nice people.
I think Simon's the man because he's straight up with everything.
Oh, well please, let us not stand in your way.
Simon, give him your straight up opinion please.
I was gonna say no.
you like him saying no to you?
it's fine that he's honest. -Well he's not overjoyed, no.
do you believe he's telling the honest truth?
I believe he's always telling the honest truth.
there you go so then, uh, there it is.
are you playing with somebody's career because of your ego?
No! You say no!
he wants to hear the truth from the truth teller.
right, Paula?
I'm abstaining.
Paula, what say you? Simon said no.
the guy that tells the truth said no.
um, I like your audition.
I thought you did a good job.
I think you are deserved of going to hollywood.
okay.
it's up to you, man.
I also tell the truth and guess what?
I disagree with the guy that you think tells the truth no.
and I say yes and so guess what that means?
Yes, going to hollywood.
you get to hollywood!
Thanks, dude.
what a-- Wait, so just so now he's not telling the truth, I'm not telling the truth, but he is telling the truth.
he said no, we said yes.
who's telling the truth up here?
who's truth are you believing?
uh, well yeah, welcome to hollywood.
lucky for Brandon he nailed his audition.
his trip to hollywood is in the bag.
Oh, man.
Yeah, hollywood here I come, baby!
hollywood's waiting for me.
Brandon can't wait to get to hollywood, but no one was more excited to be here than Kayla Hatfield.
my Kayla Hatfield and I'm from Campbell, Texas.
I'm 24.
I live on a farm with eight horses.
Oh, Dixie girl.
I've got two children.
they're three and four.
when I was 18 years old I had just gotten a new car.
I was going straight through an intersection and another driver just t-boned me and it trapped me in the car. I was totally knocked out.
I remember waking up and hearing the chopper, the whp whoop whoop.
as her family, how scared, how frighten were you when she had that accident?
well I thought she was dead.
you did, really?
Yeah, when I walked in the hospital, she was missing her face.
about a week later I woke up in ICU and I remember looking at my face for the first time.
you know, having this for the rest of my life.
I looked at the other part and I said, wow, I still can see. I've got one good eye.
I don't have patches over both eyes.
it looks like a pretty full recovery.
Yes, yes.
I'm ready to go.
good!
no matter what happens, you know, I'm living life.
come on in.
how y'all doing?
what a colorful outfit.
I wanted to stand out.
that's-- this is making a statement.
I love it and I want to make people happy.
and I've been making people laugh all day with it on, so.
what's your name?
good for you.
so you're here because you're the next American Idol.
um, yes, I feel I'm already American Idol and there's many out there because, um.
everything, just being a survivor and
and getting on with it and being positive and that's what being American is about.
exactly.
that's good.
all right, so what are you gonna sing?
I got some Janice.
okay.
all right, all right.
you look like you're out of breath there.
I've been nervous.
love Kayla.
it's the stomach.
Ooh, it's just-- thank you.
Kayla, I want to be you for one hour a day.
I actually do.
or maybe two.
you're so happy, aren't you?
Oh, well I'm just grateful for this opportunity. This is awesome.
Yeah, but you're happy. I like you.
well look, Kayla, under the assumption that most rock and roll singers should be slightly mad in a good way, I'm gonna say yes.
Kayla, I love your personality.
and I actually think that you, you have
you're able to sing but you're worried about getting that grovel when you're singing those songs in your voice that you kind of run out of gas when you're singing.
Kayla, I think you're a sweetheart but I don't think you're ready for this.
you're gonna say no?
sorry. -No, you can't.
Oh, you've got to give this girl a chance.
you've got to give this girl a chance.
you know what?
pitch problems.
some things going on there.
I actually like the
I just like you.
yes or no? -I like her too.
welcome to hollywood, yes!
all right, all right!
welcome to hollywood!
she's through!
I love her.
love her.
we're gonna--we're gonna keep doing this.
we'll take a break and come back right here in Dallas, Texas.
hopefully there's more golden tickets.
stay with us on idol, right?
high five! I'm going to hollywood.
after the break, Texas brings the heat as some warm up.
but it's Simon that needs cooling off.
what the bloody hell was that?
it's 4: 00 pm in Dallas and back at the ranch, the holding room is thinning out.
unfortunately, so is the talent.
you sound like you're seven.
at was all so atrocious, unfortunately.
creepy.
it were not okay at the corral.
and the judges are getting the impression maybe the talent in Texas has been tapped.
it's all right. It's okay.
so there's a lot on the line for the last audition of the day.
how are you?
you look nice. -Excited.
so your name is Katie Malloy. -Yes.
you're 18 from Houston, Texas. -Yes.
l impressions?
Yes.
of whom?
um, I can do Shakira, Britney Spears.
the guy from Rascal Flatts I'm pretty good at.
let's see the Britney Spears.
okay.
very good. -Very nice.
wow, Britney, you should move to hollywood and hang out with Britney.
Yeah, I know.
now do Katie Malloy.
okay.
okay, I'm gonna stop you one more time 'cause this is important.
I want to hear you.
Yeah, let's hear you.
okay.
no impersonations.
okay.
I like you. I thought that was good.
I like Katie Malloy more than all those other people.
thank you.
Katie, that was so important because what you just proved is exactly what we're looking for.
Yeah, you. -And it's natural.
you're--you're a very talented girl.
you're beautiful.
good for you.
Simon, yes or no.
I think of all the people we've seen so far this year-- I agree.
you're the best so far.
thank you so much.
I really do. I've got a feeling about you.
thank you.
it wa... You are super, super talented.
thank you.
not gonna say that, but- -You want to know something also?
I do, really.
now that we all know that you can impersonate everyone, come wings that you can really shine on.
are you, just you. -Okay, I will.
so yes or no, Simon.
100% yes. -Paula. -Absolutely.
million percent yes. Welcome to hollywood, baby yeah!
she said welcome to-- oh, my god!
so it's the end of day one here in Dallas.
Katie may have been the last one through to hollywood.
I'm going to hollywood!
but she wasn't the only one.
welcome to hollywood, dawg!
11 other people got that golden ticket, taking them one step closer to their dream.
stop, you big dork!
welcome to hollywood. You got some
I am a star.
I'll show you. That's all right.
I'm coming to hollywood. You'll see.
so as the sun sets over the clear Texas sky and our judges retire.
we can only wonder who will be joining them in hollywood.
day two of auditions after the break.
when we come back, day two in dallas takes flight.
What--what show is this?
Kyle runs for office.
one day, I would like to become the governor of Oklahoma.
it's Daughtry 2. 0
rock on.
and Kelly Clarkson comes home.
crap, I screwed it up.
okay, I now officially hate that song.
it's day two in Dallas, Texas.
the sun is still shining.
the crowd is still screaming.
gonna make it happen today, baby.
and the judges are still excited.
the south, the big ol' state of Texas, come on.
you know, on American Idol, we've been all over the great state of Texas.
we've been to Austin, San Antonio, we've been to Houston.
now we're back in Dallas.
we found the original American Idol.
these guys are ready to reclaim the title, right?
I mean, come on, come on!
what's wrong?
I don't wanna--I don't wanna lose my voice.
you don't wanna lose your-- okay.
I don't want--I don't want you to strain it then. All right.
Stina Aguilera.
my name is Douglas Davidson.
I'm 28.
I'm from Austin, Texas.
and I'm a student.
Oh I've been trying to restart my singing, you know, um, hobby.
since I was 16.
I've read this article with Christina Aguilera.
this interview, like, she said you cannot
if you don't know what you're doing, you could permanently damage your voice and lose it forever.
well, my family does not know I'm here today.
my dad caught me singing one time, like eight years ago, and he's like, who do you think you are?
but then I would, like, sing so well a lot of times, he would say, like, I hate you.
Like--not like, man, I hate you, you're so good.
like I really hate you.
are you nervous, Douglas?
um, can I do, like, warm up type thing, or something?
Yeah, please.
I'm help--okay.
Douglas, how long is this gonna take?
Oh, my god.
I just do that as a warm up. Like--- Got it.
so that wasn't the audition.
um, can--I guess I'll start my audition now, like- - Okay.
okay. What are you gonna sing?
I'm gonna do, um, living on a prayer by Bon Jovi.
of course.
what the bloody hell was that?
this is the weirdest audition, man.
okay, I know I was--I was rough on that note.
it wasn't as good as before- -the one note?
that one note. - Yeah.
about the 20, 30 notes on that one were rough, yeah.
gotta take a drink of water.
take a deep breath. Relax.
why are you bothering with this?
Oh, is he serious? Is this serious? - What's he doing?
OK. Douglas, because you know why?
yo we're gonna have to speed it up just a little bit - What song is that? - What song is that?
Douglas. - I'm building it.
wait, wait. - Douglas, I don't want to hear any more of this stupidity.
look, I was worried about if I was gonna screw up like this.
well, you did. And you're sweating, and you're nervous.
and you're walking around in circles. - Can I just try one song one more time?
No.No, and you're whispering and panting. You sang, like, four songs.
and doing all this strange stuff.
he's not listening.
just let him keep singing.
wow, you really projected on that one.
I was trying to do better. - Yeah.
was it--you're saying it was better? - No.
you projected on that one.
uh, yes or no, Simon?
all right, no one in a million years is ever gonna pay to hear you sing.
but did you see, like, I did better, like, just a few seconds like that?
I can do a lot better. - No.
the tightness that you were feeling opened up a little bit.
Oh, come off it, Paula. - It's true.
cause, like, when your voice is tight, you cannot resonate.
it can make you sound like- - It doesn't matter, Douglas.
you can't--dude, singing is not your thing, baby. - None of it matters.
maybe You're gonna do it again, aren't you? - Of course.
get out.
Douglas, they're gonna take you somewhere safe.
gonna make sure you get off the stage, brother.
they're gonna take you to a safe place. - Thank you, Douglas.
and in the safety of the stairwell, Douglas tries to at least leave on a good note.
Aah It's a very weird city today, this Dallas. This is weird.
and I thought that was-- I think that was pretty decent.
Hello, Angela.
how are you?
great, nice to meet you guys. - Nice to meet you.
so what's your last name, Angela what?
that's my original name. I just got married.

why, though--why, chad? - Why would I buy it?
Yeah. You think the vocals are good? -Yeah.
dawg, really? - Yeah.
it's kinda like bad karaoke. - It was very--it was amateurish.
Paula, what do you think?
Oh, sweetie pie. Reality check.
no.
nowhere near.
but we like you, though.
you're a sweetheart. You're beautiful. - Nice girl.
and you got a beautiful marriage.
we love Chad. Chad's a model like Simon and I.
although Simon and I do mostly speedo work.

Bye, guys. - Thank you, guys.

Yeah, he really loves her. - He really loves her.
who needs a golden ticket, anyways, when you have your soul mate by your side?
but how long will the love fest last in Dallas?
coming up, we meet a cowboy eager to get off the farm.
to get somewhere, you gotta give up some stuff sometimes.
so I'm willing to do it.
a politician desperate to win your votes.
my glasses aren't glaring, are they?
and a rocker ready to rip.
welcome back to American Idol.
Texas is a state rich in political history.
heck, even our own president hails from here.
and this being an election year, it's only appropriate we find a candidate of our own.
Hello, my name's Kyle Lindsley.
and elect me to be your next American Idol.
I think I should be the next American Idol because not only can I sing, but I also make good decisions.
I think I make smart choices.
I have really good character.
if I was the next American Idol,
I would try my best to use music to inspire people, and, uh, just to have fun and to entertain people.
I'm a junior at Oklahoma State University.
I am double majoring in international business and political science.
I've always been interested in politics.
and one day I would like to become the governor of Oklahoma.
if I am the next American Idol,
I will try my best to be a good role model for people.
I think in the entertainment industry, it's really important to have good character and to make smart choices.
and I think that's what I would bring, uh, to this business.
if I was the next--can I start over?
what I do?
my glasses aren't glaring, are they? - No, no, they look good.
okay, so Randy, Paula, and Simon.
okay, are they gonna actually see this?
Randy, Paula, and Simon, I am going to be the next American Idol.
this is not a real political ad.
in case it isn't obvi this is a joke, ha ha. Ha ha ha.
so optimistic. So opti.
I am so optimistic. Hi, sweetheart. - Hey.
how are you? - I'm great, how are you?
Kyle, you are a happy guy, aren't you?
Yeah, I'm really excited to be here.
okay, Kyle, what are you gonna sing?
I'm gonna sing somebody to love by queen.
okay, off you go, Kyle.
I'm so optimistic right now. - Yeah, me too.
thank you. - Thanks.
well, well, well. - Y're not as bad as I thought you were gonna be.
well, thank you.
so what does that mean for you?
yes or no, Simon? - Yes.
um, I don't know if I was as enthused as Simon.
but I--you know.
I felt like I was at, like, a glee club or some fraternity house. - I'm in a fraternity.
bunch of guys--you see, exactly.
bunch of guys are sitting around in their suits and ties, and they're taking off their jackets after the debate.
I thought it was very academic.
well, thanks. I guess.
that's not particularly...A good thing. - Helpful.
I'm gonna say no.
so I just wanna draw your attention, Paula, that you may be saying you're no to the future president of this country.
future president of the.
Yeah. - Future president.
you know, if we had a president that smiled like you. - Well, thanks.
do you happen to want this as much as you want to be in politics?
uh, actually, if I had to, like, choose right now, I would choose this.
like, I have always loved to sing.
like, I would do anything just to go to hollywood.
like, I want this so bad.
like, I really want... - You wouldn't do what Clay Aiken did and.
it's so funny that you say that, 'cause
do weird things with your hair or wear red leather jackets?
no, I promise I won't. - Or sing grease is the word?
exactly. - I won't do that.
you wouldn't do that. - I watched that...
okay, Paula, yes or no? - Oh, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle.
what the heck, I say yes.
all right, both--you won over.
Oh, gosh, thank you. - You're through to hollywood.
thank y'all so much! Thank you, this means so much to me.
good for you. - Way to go, dear.
see you later, governor.
will he be the next president of the U. S,
or will he be the next American Idol?
I'm going to hollywood!
Oh, my god! - So excited, oh!
I liked him. - Okay, there's something that came over me.
I don't know why it's called niceness.
as Kyle heads back to his headquarters to prepare for his campaign in hollywood.
back outside, there are still thousands of excited auditioners ready to get in the room.
and then, there was Tami Kazinsky.
the type of singer I am.
would be.
R&B/pop.
I compare myself to Celine Dion.
she's my idol.
I listen to her every day.
she gives me warmth and strength.
when I sing, it's.
I have practice and felt that I sing the best to my ability.
um, they might have different perspective.
and I'll just go in there and give it my best.
Texas has a history of being a little bit rough for us since Kelly Clarkson.
it's been a little rough over the years. - Yeah.
but you're gonna prove us wrong, right? - I think so.
all right, what you singing?
uh, the power of love by - Big song. - Big song.
okay, go for it. - Okay.
can I start over? - Yes, please.
please. Yeah.
what is the song?
it is? No, it's "if you asked me to."
that was "if you asked me to." - Not the one I know.
okay. - Yeah, it's if you asked me to.
did you wanna sing the power of love or if you asked me to?
Oh, yeah, go for it. There you go.
okay, okay.
how do you think it went?
I think I gave it my best shot.
well, what do you think we're gonna think?
a no.
a what?
she said no.
correct.
Yeah, you're a nice girl, but it was awful. - You're sweet.
it was awful, though.
all right, thank you. - Thank you, sweetheart.
take care.
the dream--is the dream alive? The dream is not alive.
I can tell by the lack of gold.
I just.
you seem like you're in shock.
so was it the judges? They just.
sort of made you nervous?
YH, I guess that's so. And, um, -I'm just not ready for something like this yet.
no? Do you think you'll ever do it again?
you think you'll continue to sing?
Yeah.
okay. Well, good luck. - Thanks.
okay. Relax, it's over.
as Tami heads home to unwind from the intensity of her audition, the judges can only hope that big Texas talent is about to step through the door.
what's your name?
says you're a musician. What do you play, dude?
uh, guitar--I try to play guitar, drums, and bass.
that's kinda--mainly guitar, though.
and you're in a band? - Yes.
I'm in a band with my brother.
Zach Swann.
is he happy you're here?
he's behind me, you know. - No.
it depends on how far I make it.
what's the song?
uh, boondocks by little big town.
cool. - So. Go for it.
okay.
okay.
Paula, what do you think of Colton?
I like--well, I like that song. I like it.
Yeah, Colton, I think you did a good job. I do.
I think you've gotta be
my opinion only is just to present
open your eyes more and perform to us.
cause you get a little bit lost in your own performance.
but you did a good job.
I thought it was okay, Colton.
you know, I think there's a lot of guys like you singing in bars all across America doing that.
it was okay. - Thank you.
I liked you too, man. I thought there was something good about you.
I mean, you don't have to push it as hard, but there's something I like about you.
so yes or no, Simon?
I'm either way on this one, Randy.
yes or no then?
Yes. - And yes.
and I say yes. Welcome to hollywood! - Thank you, guys! Thank you!
all right, Colton, man. Show improve, man, to hollywood, dawg.
come back with more personality.
Hey, can I mess with my parents? Can I, like, put this in my pocket?
wait, do I--I don't think you did very well, Colton.
I think you need to work on it. - All right, I'm gonna hide this.
next year, come back next year.
you were terrible!
awful, Colton! - Don't come back here again.
you're going to hollywood.
Congratulations.
thank you.
terrible. Colton, terrible.
okay, Randy.
Oh, my god! - You faked me out, dude.
that's what I wanted to do.
you just faked me out. I thought I made a mistake.
Congratulations.
Oh, my god! Oh, you scared me.
there it is.
hopefully, you guys see a lot of me.
as Colton heads to hollywood, will more talent be joining him?
find out, after the break.
put your boots on, saddle up.
cause when we come back, the men get down to business.
give it a try, 'cause pants can be restricting, if you know what I mean.
welcome back to Texas, home of the wild, wild west, the land of the cowboy, and where men are men.
what have you got in your trousers?
here's the picture of me as a guy.
and here's me as a girl.
so I just want to show you guys that I'm versatile.
guys, give it a try,'
cause pants can be restricting, if you know what I mean.
and there's breezes here that I've never felt before.
here's to hoping our next contestant ends that streak.
welcome to Saltillo, Mississippi.
I'm Drew Poppelreiter. This is my family.
this is my dad and my mom, my brother Simon, my sister Anna, and my sister Sarah.
my job is.
it's farmin'.
this is it. This is where I work.
we have a family-operated farm.
I mean, we really rely on each other to do what we're supposed to.
my family, they're a hard bunch of workin' rascals.
from the time he was six to eighteen, all he wanted to d was farm.
and then he fell in love with singin', and that's pretty much all he's ever known.
I do a lot of singin' in the tractor.
it gets lonesome. A man's gotta keep his sanity somehow.
the time goes a lot quicker when you're out there singin', and he says it gives him a boost.
if I get too to hollywood, it's gonna be the first time that I've ever got on a plane.
uh, kinda nervous about that.
as the city goes, I.
I usually like my hayfields.
but we can make do out there too.
Amen. - Bless the cook.
Farmin', uh, just, it's in my blood.
but I've gotta say, to get somewhere, you've gotta give up some stuff sometimes.
so. I'm willing to do it.
you work on a farm? - Yes, sir.
but you don't like working on a farm. - Well, I like it.
it's, uh--actually, I love it.
it's, uh, it's kind of a hate-love relationship.
now... - It's got a lot of good qualities, but it can be tiresome and troublesome.
it's a lot of hard work, man. - Oh, yes, sir.
okay, Drew, and what are you gonna sing?
yeah? What George Strait song?
I can do check yes or no.
uh, try the check yes or no.
I think I heard that once or twice.
OK - Simon, yes or no?
no.
and why?
not my thing. - Okay.
Randy, yes or no?
you know what, Drew? I actually like you, man.
I like the whole Randy Travis, George Strait, simple guy.
farmer. Dallas, Texas, south thing.
I actually like it.
I mean, I grew up with it, so I actually-- I like this guy.
I'm gonna say yes. I like this.
I like Drew, man.
okay, Drew, here's the thing. - Yes, ma'am.
I think that you are who you are. - Yes, ma'am.
you've got a good tone to your voice.
my thing is I didn't feel any kind of wow factor with your performance.
and that's something that-- Hold on.
if I could say something.
are you not going to agree.
with- - - She doesn't every time.
Paula's her own person, dude.
you know what, Drew? - Yes, ma'am?
that's a habit. I'm sorry.
I love that--the politeness. A true southern gentleman, Paula.
I'm gonna say yes.
welcome to hollywood!
a true southern gentleman!
a true farmin' man, works hard for his money. I like this guy.
go out there and--And scream your loudest. - All right.
how are you? - Fine. I'm great.
drew is off to hollywood, California. - Yes.
he's leaving row crop.
and the livestock, and he's going to hollywood.
dude, I--I did it.
I--I freakin' made it.
I'm goin' to hollywood!
what about that?
so we got ourselves a little country headed to hollywood.
but what about a little rock and roll?
my name is Kyle Reinick, and I am going to be the next rock sensation on American Idol.
I'm a pretty hardcore rocker.
I like. rockin'.
the look kind of speaks for itself, you know?
the shirt says, "do you idol Kyle?"
and I got all my fans here signing it.
the eyeliner. Or guyliner,"" as I should say.
it kind of adds to the rocking out.
when I get into my performances, I'm pretty edgy.
I haven't seen myself rock out, but I've heard that I'm pretty intense.
rock on!
I thought you'd never arrive.
Oh, I'm--I'm here.
I'm ready to rock.
dude, what is all of this?
this is--these are my kids.
I'm a counselor for them.
Kyle Reinick, and you're 20. And where are you from, dude?
from Edwardsville, Illinois.
it's about 20 minutes outside of St. Louis.
uh, uh, did they make your shirt too?
Oh, no, I made this.
but all of the signatures are-- all of the kids and my friends.
so you're here auditioning for your kids with your kids?
Yeah, they're rocking out for me, see?
like he's belting out.
got the rock sign on. - How old are these kids?
uh, kindergarten through second grade.
so you're a nice guy. - I am.
a lot of patience.
with the kids, sometimes. You know.
all right, so tell me about yourself, man.
what are you gonna sing, man?
uh, Kelly Clarkson, never again.
all right, cool.
thank you, Kyle.
do you sing that song to those children?
I have sang in front of them before.
were they scared?
no, they loved it.
they actually came and tackled me. - Oh, okay.
well, in this--not after I sang it, but
you mean they flew at you like a pack?
look, a demon. Tackle the demon.
Kyle, it was a very disturbing, slightly demonic, I thought, audition.
your face does a very, very weird thing when you sing.
and your eyes, I thought, looked very menacing.
well, I've heard I'm really, like, intense with it.
but that's my performance.
no, it's more than intense. It's verging on scary, yeah.
Yeah, it's a little scary, the eyes. - The eyes.
Yeah, the eyes.
you have the eyeliner.
it's like that goth--It's guyliner.
no, I'm not goth at all. - Guyliner, I like that!
no, but you know what? It's a trend now.
a lot of guys--You know what, tell about that.
it's not eyeliner, Ryan. It's guyliner. - I know.
Paula, how did you think the voice was?
a little scary. - Really?
what does your
do you idol Kyle?
Oh, do you idol Kyle?
I think--I think it was the whole audition, and the
and the eyebrows and the staring and the--and--it just was like
what about better than Ezra, like
because I don't think you can ever do anything about those eyes.
and, dude, the vocals really weren't on point. Asn't great.
the vocals were-- It was not great.
you switch keys inside of the song, you know.
so, Simon, yes or no?
Simon, yes or no?
Simon, yes or no?
Kyle, you are reinforcing my opinion right now.
it's a definite no.
all right. - Paula, yes or no?
no. - No?
no. - It's a no, Kyle.
all right. - Thank you, though.
thank you. - And I appreciate the kids.
they're funny.
they said I was too, like, intense.
or, like, my eyes were.
too, like, into my performance. But I don't kn
as Kyle rocks on,
we roll to break. Up next.
Kelly gets a homecoming fit for a queen.
score!
and we may have just found the next king of pop.
welcome back to Dallas, where there may only be one star on the Texas flag, but today thousands are vying for a shot at superstardom.
we found our first idol, Kelly Clarkson, in this town.
I made it!
and it seems her fan base here is the size of the state itself.
crap, I screwed it up.
I am so sorry. Nerves--dang!
okay, I now officially hate that song.
so while Kelly's song might not be the ticket to hollywood, maybe it would help if you were from the same hometown of Burleson, Texas.
Nina Shaw. Come on in, love.
Nina Shaw, wow! - Beautiful.
so now you're 24.
you're from Burleson, Texas. - Burleson.
good old Burleson.
hometown of Kelly Clarkson that Paula and I chose.
we knew she win. - Yep.
Really? You have that on tape, do you? - We could rewind the tapes, and the tapes would say Paula and I picked Kelly first.
there's also on tape you going after hollywood auditions, "I don't get this girl.
Yes, yes, so anyway, no pressure about that. - Okay.
okay, you might be apologizing when you see the tapes back.
well, I don't think so. Randy and I know the truth. - We know the truth.
watch the tapes back. - And she's here to represent.
Hey, Nina, welcome to the dysfunctional family.
Hi, okay. - Whatcha gonna sing today?
let's hear you. Let's see what you got.
thank you.
Simon, what do you think of Nina Shaw, dawg?
very, very, very old-fashioned, Nina.
it's all over-thought, overdone, and very cabaret.
for me it's very pageant-like.
well, I have another song.
two seconds.
thank you.
you know what, I like you.
I think the jazzier side is cool.
I like that in the wake of what's going on now with Amy Winehouse and all these people with the throwback stuff.
what was old from the '50s,'60s is now new again in the jazz way.
I like you. You look great.
I thought you sang the jazz thing really good.
thank you. - I disagree, Randy.
I think there is a difference. - Of course!
between being retro and old-fashioned.
okay, well, I'm gonna say no.
Randy said yes.
and I think Paula's gonna say.
hang on, hang on.
I think that you have-- you show promise.
I'm gonna say yes.
Congratulations.
welcome to hollywood!
two yeses, one no! Welcome to hollywood, Nina!
I wasn't sure where that was going. - Thank you!
Bye, dear. - Bye, thank you, so much.
Congratulations.
something's in the water in Burleson, huh?
Yes, definitely. Oh, my goodness, oh!
when we come back, prepare for an audition seven seasons in the making.
you won't believe your eyes.
it's nearly sunset over the great state of Texas.
and after 12 hours of intense auditions.
ahh judges are ready to call Dallas a day.
but back in the holding room, one man still waits.
ready to take flight.
I want to audition because this is a privilege to sing to the whole world.
that's it.
if I were an American Idol, then I would give hope to those who are in despairs.
and to be tough, to be strength.
do people welcome you with open arms?
Yeah, and one is doing this. - They bow?
Yeah. - People bow.
why do they bow? - I don't know!
I must not have any admirers.
I haven't--no one's--I've never been bowed to.
no, I don't believe you. - No, believe me.
no one's ever-- You have many admirers.
well, no one's ever bowed. - Oh, I bow.
that feels great. Could you do it again?
Oh, sure! - That's even better.
well, good luck, all right?
we hope to see you in hollywood.
believe me, you'd fit in.
thank you. Thank you.
go ahead and wait in line.
why is Simon's name on your hat?
for two reasons.
everyone everywhere, as long as there is free media, television, radio.
even a newborn baby.
sometimes you ask a question you really wish you hadn't asked.
Yes, yes.
what show is this?
secondly
we don't want to know any more.
we don't want to know why.
don't tell us any more. That's enough.
he's the sun, he's the light, he's the rain. - I had hope.
he's all the forces of the elements of the planets, sun, and everything.
I want to know what you're gonna sing right now.
my own original composition.
we're brothers forever. - Of course - What's it called? - We're brothers forever.
you and Simon are brothers forever?
all of us. - All of us.

one more time!
okay, Renaldo. - Ryan, that was it, man.
what was that called?
this one?
what was the song called?
the title? - Yes.
we're brothers forever.
I'm gonna make a prediction here.
I have a horrible feeling that's gonna be a hit record.
Renaldo, listen, you are very entertaining.
I actually like you.
but it's gonna be a no.
give him a hug.
come on, this guy wrote a song for you.
give him a hug. This is your brother.
well, he didn't write it for me. I was just in the lyric.
Simon, you are a great person.
you give chance to everyone to sing to the whole world.
I thank you.
you are heaven's chosen.
you give chance to any talent for free of charge.
even they throw you negative words.
I hate you, Simon.
you, Simon.
but there are many people who really like you, really admire you.
one of them is me.
you are a great person, Simon.
in all, 24 people are headed to hollywood from Dallas.
all given the seal of approval from the mighty Cowell.
and Paula and Randy.
you are my glory, Simon.
next WEEK, It's fun in the sun as idol heads west to san Diego, California.
our first visit yields some big crowds.
welcome to San Diego!
and some big fans.
Simon makes some friends.
come on, come sit with me.
how are you?
Simon, fuck you.
emotions ran high.
Oh. my. god.
Yes! - And the talent in waves.
million percent yes, dude. I love you.
second chances were given, but would they pay off?
that wasn't as good as two years ago.
find out who snags a golden ticket in the golden state.
it's auditions in San Diego.
you ever hear of a guy named William Hung?
welcome to Charleston, South Carolina, one of the most beautiful cities in the nation, and recently named the friendliest city in America.
but will it be generous with fresh, untapped talent?
we hope so.
back in the south, friends.
this is American Idol.
tonight we sure are glad you all could join us as the idol auditions march into Charleston, South Carolina.
it's our first visit to America's eighth state, and we found a very special place, rich in history, beautiful architecture, good old southern hospitality.
is everybody ready this morning?
and over 10, 000 contestants who came out to greet us from all over the country.
all the way from Alaska!
Hello, Charleston, from Honolulu, Hawaii.
american idol. Remember this face.
with so many contestants, could we find the next Ruben, or the next Fantasia, or the next Kelly?
could one of these people be the next to change music history?
the contestants couldn't wait first, Simon had to figure out where he was.
wait, we're on the west coast, yeah?
the east coast, South Carolina.
and we we well, almost.
Oliver Himan would have been the first contestant of the day, but his wife had other plans.
it's my and my wife's anniversary, and she's also 37 weeks pregnant and her water just broke, so we're gonna take her to the hospital real quick.
and hopefully, hopefully, we'll make it back in time today.
if not, we'll figure something out about American Idol, but the baby's the most important thing, of course.
meanwhile, back in line, the most important thing for Rishard was his afro.
my name is Rishard Henderson.
I currently reside in Atlanta, Georgia.
I'm unemployed.
hopefully I can get a job today being the next american idol.
I'm just a complete nut.
I'm always smiling.
I think I'm gonna die like this
who would you compare yourself to?
they call me the black Clay Aiken. That's what they say.
I think Clay is a very great singer, but I think I'm unique because I think I'm different from him.
I want to be Rishard.
come on in, don't be 'fraid.
I love the hair.
what's your name, man?
my name is Ray Henderson, but I go by Rishard.
what do people usually say when you sing? Do they love yousinging voice?
they say, "you know who you sound like"?
which guy?
no. What you gonna sing, dawg?
I'm gonna do "I can't make you love me."
good song. - Go ahead.
thank you very much.
God, it did remind me of Clay Aiken.
is that a good thing, Simon, or a bad thing?
it's not a great thing. - I think it's different.
a little bit over the top, maybe.
I wouldn't have been surprised if you would have done a magic trick in the middle of that.
okay, randy, what do you think?
uh, dude, it's just, you know, it was just so over the top.
Yeah, it, I mean, very theatrical, not pop style.
find out who you are, who you want to be.
stop all the vocal antics.
it's almost like you're mimicking people.
I'm me, I'm Rishard.
it was very, actually 1970's cruise ship cabaret.
Randy, yes or no?
no, dawg, not ready, man.
I'm sorry, sweetheart. - Sorry.
thank you so much. - But we enjoyed you.
thank you.
thank you, man. - Nice to meet you.
next in line was another contestant about to follow in the footsteps of a previous idol, though not necessarily in the same shoes.
my name is Deanna Purvat.
I'm 27 years old.
I'm from Albemarle, North Carolina, and I am a waitress.
Albemarle? - Yeah.
I only know that because Kellie Pickler's from Albemarle, right? - Right.
Marl. - Merl, okay.
I'm hoping that American Idol will like me almost as good as Kelly Pickler.
if I don't sound any better than kelly pickler, I really don't want to be here.
I like her sassy song red hot heels, I really do.
she struts around in her red high heels, destroying what they had to lose.
I don't really care.
if I'm gonna lose you, I am more likely to run you down with a baseball bat than to strut around in high heels, 'cause I'd be breaking my neck in the heels.
Yeah.
Hello, how are you?
good, how are you?
I'm good, what is your name?
and what do you do?
I waitress.
who's the worst customer you've ever had?
I can't really pinpoint a customer.
the worst crowd is the sunday crowd, especially since we got the new all-you-can-eat in.
pile it on.
it's not a buffet. It's order as you go.
when they finish that plate, they order more, so they run us to death, and they love to leave a whole dollar.
that's terrible.
do you ever tell them,"you guys should be ashamed of yourselves"?
absolutely not.
that's not professional.
I would.
I know you would, and that's why you're in the business that you're in and not waitressing.
and what are you gonna sing, sweetheart.
I'm gonna sing Fancy. - Okay.
thank you.
you're a little tiger, aren't you, Dina?
Deanna. That's right, correct him.
that's why I spell my name with a capital "a," just to eliminate the whole "Dina." It's Deanna.
okay. - That's right.
Simon, what do you think of Deanna?
uh, it was a bit angry, wasn't it?
Yes.
it's supposed to be an angry song.
it was those sunday people who eat all that lunch, isn't it?
Yes.
Yeah. It puts you in a bad mood.
I don't think you've got a great voice.
I think, you know, I like all the passion and the anger and the getting down on your knees.
okay, so simon, yes or no?
I'm gonna say no.
okay.
Paula, don't- - I'm gonna have to pass.
it's a no from me too, but thank you for coming out. We enjoyed you.
have a great day. - All right.
and if I came for lunch would only have one helping, I really wouldn't dare it be more than that.
kidding.
but we are coming back for more.
coming up, idol brought them together.
we first met right by that trash can.
but will Simon drive them apart?
that was a horrible audition, if I'm being honest with you.
and the Lampkins get down.
Hey, Simon, enjoy some southern hospitality!
welcome back to Charleston, friendliest city in America.
but no one was friendlier than this young couple.
my name is Crystal Ortiz.
I'm currently living in Raleigh, North Carolina, and I'm 26 years old.
my name is Randy Stark.
I live in Abilene, Texas, and I'm 27.
the two of you are an item? - Yes.
okay, and how did you meet?
we met on American Idol. Com message boards.
I'm pretty well known as one of the gurus on there, giving out advice and tips and suggestions.
master yoda take you to simon he will.
he was patient with all my stupid questions.
we just hit it off.
we first met right over there, right by that trash can.
crystal and randy certainly had chemistry with each other, but how will they make out in the audition room?
thank you.
so, uh, what's your name?
my name is Randy Stark.
I like that first name a lot.
what's your name?
my name is Crystal Ortiz.
all right, so what are you guys singing?
it's called "she's Moe"by Andy Griggs.
okay.
okay, all right, well, that was complete torture.
it says here that you give advice about auditions on the message boards.
what do you say?
I talk more about the audition process and what to expect,'cause I've done it before.
I mean, Randy, that was a horrible audition, if I'm being honest with you.
but the good news is, is that you found each other.
good for you. - That's romantic.
that's cute, man.
Randy, yes or no?
well, as far as the singing, definitely not.
should I not sing it at family stuff and
no, if I was in your family, I'd ask you not to.
I just wanted to know if my parents were blind.
deaf. - Yeah.
congratulations on the love, though, man, what about love?
go and check into a hotel.
Oh, let's have a kiss.
see you later.
couldn't keep their hands off each other.
at least crystal and randy can always be heard on the message boards.
but would the partnership of michelle and jeffrey lampkin be anything to write home about?
Ooh, I feel it.
groovy, baby, groovy, oh!
I'm Michelle Lampkin.
and I'm Jeffrey Lampkin.
this is my big sister. - And this is my little brother.
you seem like you'd be shy.
now, you really like to come out of your shell and perform?
I'm shy.
anybody can sing.
but you gotta have that "ow" factor.
Yeah, girl, ow!
what are we snappin' about? - We're ready, ow!
Hollywood, here we come!
I want to see that in the wings. Give that to Randy right now.
Yes, yes, yes!
how y'all doin'? - Yes!
now, now, now, now what's going on now?
who is who and what--what- - This is uncanny.
Hi, Simon. - How are you?
Hi, Paula.
what's up, Randy? - What's going down?
what's your name?
Michelle. - Michelle and
my name is Jeffrey.
now Jeffrey, where did you get your influence from?
okay, well, this is from Paula--you make me hot with my hot pink.
then Randy, you know, the little sportswear and also the shoes.
you like the shoes? - Yeah, I like, I like.
Simon, I have my dog tags on for you,'cause you have that military presence, but I love it.
military presence, yes! - Yes!
what are you gonna sing?
we're gonna do a piece of I'm your angel by R. Kelly and Celine Dion.
right, okay.
okay.
very nice.
slightly inappropriate at the end, but it was good.
no, it's a song.
come on, it's a song. - Well, you know what I mean.
okay, Jeffrey, in my opinion, I thought you were better than your sister.
I did. I like you, though. I like you both.
thank you. - You're funny.
america needs a good laugh these days.
no, no, listen, after what we've seen today, you two are a breath of fresh air, I've got to tell you.
well, thank you. Thank you so much.
I think the two of you are very special. - Thank you.
Yes, you are, you have great chemistry, you two.
you have a beautiful tone to your voice.
you have to really work on it, though,'cause you have a gift.
dawg, I thought you were the bomb, man. - Thank you.
I thought it was really, really good and entertaining, and it was all in pitch, in tune, I'm like, yeah that's what it's about.
okay, Randy, yes or no?
uh, yes to Jeffrey.
and no to the sister?
Yeah. - Paula.
I say yes to Jeffrey and yes to Michelle.
and I'm gonna go-- - It's up to simon.
with Paula.
welcome to hollywood! - We made it! Oh, my god!
I can't--I can't split- - Two seconds, just two seconds, Simon.
I can't split you two up.
Oh, man, south Carolina! - Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey!
Yes, yes.
you have three months to get your sister in shape. - Okay.
work on the vocals with her, dawg. - Okay.
you're both going to hollywood.
welcome to hollywood, both of y'all!
finally we've got a couple who has made it through, and they've got golden tickets to hollywood.
ha ha, I got my ticket, ha ha, I got a ticket, ha ha, I got a ticket
Hallelujah to you!
Hallelujah to you!
thank you, god!
you can't split those two up, randy.
finally a result in Charleston.
but can they continue to bring the heat?
I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot!
we'll find out after the break.
coming up, words fail...
tempers flare.
this show is fake and rigged.
what did you say?
and a cheerleader tries to save the world.
I'm a stars panelist, students teaching and respecting sexuality, so I preach about abstinence.
Yep, I'm gonna try and live by that code.
welcome back to Charleston.
the talent trek continues with little success.
no.
Oliver Himan and his wife are hoping for a better result.
this is our first baby.
we're having a little girl.
we're gonna name her Emma Grace, and hopefully we won't have her in the car.
it looks like it's gonna turn out to be an exciting day in a totally different way, so we're ready.
but driving through an unfamiliar city was proving difficult.
I think I'm lost.
I missed the street.
and I even have directions, ladies, I have directions.
meanwhile, our judges were lost for words as our contestants schooled them in the fine art of revenge.
I'm sorry man, I--um, then it goes--but I'm gonna skip the rest of that verse and then I'm gonna go into the next verse, where it goes, um...
Hey, let me look one more quick time, man.
don't disqualify me, man. Let me do this, man.
come on, man, I'm--hey, man, this is the next American idol.
thank you.
lesson learned.
love really does hurt.
and someone else with a message was 16-year-old Amy Catherine Flynn.
I'm a junior at knoxville catholic high school.
I'm the captain of the dance team.
I do that every day.
I really enjoy doing that, because I know that I lead and, like, everyone respects me.
I do stars.
it's students teaching and respecting sexuality, and so I go to schools and talk about abstaining from sex and drugs and alcohol.
I just like to be able to be there for everyone.
hello.
what's your name?
Amy, Amy Catherine, A.C.Whatevs.
so Amy, besides being a student, what else do you do? What's going on with you?
I'm the captain of my dance team and I'm a stars panelist, students teaching and respecting sexuality, so I preach about abstinence and
Simon needs that course.
wrong, Randy Jackson.
Yeah, Simon needs that heavily, Simon.
I could give you a good speech if you'd like to hear it.
okay.
like let's say that you're like, oh, I really love my boyfriend--or girlfriend, whichever way, you know.
and you're like, oh, I've been with him for so long.
I should have sex with him. Like, it's totally cool.
we've been together for forever.
then you're like, if you're gonna marry them, why can't you wait another five, six years, and then you're like, oh, then we're gonna do it then, and then you're like, we waited all that time, and now it's like really special, like, we have such self-control.
Amy, I think you're absolutely right.
I love that. I think that's nice.
Yep, I'm gonna try and live by that code.
I like Simon a lot.
we're on the same page, Amy, right?
he's learning a lot from you right now.
so what are you gonna sing, Amy?
reflections by Christina Aguilera.
good song. - Go for it
okay.
Paula, what do you think of that vocal?
Amy, I like you.
there's moments of your voice, especially towards the end, that are just so pure, innocent, beautiful.
I'm gonna say yes.
this isn't gonna be quite so thumbs up, I'm afraid, Amy.
I personally thought the song was too big for you.
big for me? - You know, it was a little bit like a annoying girl singing in the bedroom.
I think that's a bit much to say.
sorry.
I really do. - Sorry.
a lot of people are gonna find you annoying, Amy.
no, they're not.
no, they're not. - No, they are.
no, they're not. - A lot of people will like you, Amy, and then there's a lot of people who are gonna find you very annoying.
why do you say that?
because you are very, very confident.
I don't think you're as good as you think you are.
okay, so Simon, yes or no?
I loved it. - Yes.
okay, guess what? I like your voice.
I think you've got mad potential.
mad potential.
you've got to work on it.
Yes, welcome to hollywood!
and stay away from that Ryan Seacrest. - Thank you.
Yeah, give him that speech too.
Ryan really needs it. - Yeah, you should give him a long speech.
I love her.
you didn't find her annoying?
no, I think she's adorable.
Oh, come on, Paula. - And I think she sang very well.
she's got a golden ticket I've got a golden ticket
I agree with that speech, by the way, Simon.
one week in L. A. , It'll all change.
coming up, she put singing on hold to care for her dad.
you're focused on your father who, every day could have been his last day.
will London finally realize her dream?
and we meet Aretha.
Simon, you are going to love me.
she has the confidence, but can she rack up another golden ticket?
the first day in charleston is wrapping up, and the judges are starting to flag.
thank you, Amanda. Aminda. Whatever.
still hoping for a chance to see the judges is oliver himan, who left the auditions earlier because his wife went into labor.
well, we finally got in a room, so we're in for a long day, but we're looking forward to it.
Simon, Paula, Randy, hopefully i get to see you soon, though.
back at the auditions, the last contestant of the day warmed up.
after a tough three years, she hopes American Idol can bring a new beginning.
my name is London Whiteberg.
I'm 24 years old, and I'm from Charleston, South Carolina.
growing up in charleston was beautiful.
I grew up right on the beach.
it was surreal to wake up every morning to the ocean, you know, just the sounds of the waves.
my family is with me today, my mom and my fiance.
she's been singing ever since she's just been a little girl.
this is what we've wanted for her.
it's been her dream.
our family's been through a lot.
I lost my dad three years ago to cancer.
he was always extremely supportive of music.
when my dad was sick, I definitely had to put music on hold.
you're focused on your father who, you know, every day could have been his last day.
that was very traumatic for our family.
it lit a fire underneath me to really pursue my dreams and that life is short, you know?
and you only have so long to seize every opportunity.
hello. - Hello.
your name is...
London.
london is a fantastic name.
right, what do you do, London?
I'm a full-time musician.
and what are you gonna sing today?
I'm gonna do a Billie Holiday song, "good morning, heartache."
okay.
okay. - Very nice.
Randy, did you like that?
I think you've got a nice tone to your voice. - Thank you.
it wasn't the best audition I've seen, but I kind of liked it.
I gotta tell you, the tone of your voice, it's engaging.
it's pleasant. It's nice, it's got a pop quality but also a bluesy quality.
I like it, I really like it. - Thank you.
I thought it was a good audition, London.
having said that, there are thousands of singers like you all over the country.
good-looking girl, good voice. I don't hear anything unique.
I say you're worth coming to hollywood and hearing what your repertoire of songs is.
so you're saying yes. - I say yes.
Paula says yes. - Thank you.
I'm gonna say yes too, based on just your vocals.
okay, you're through. Off you go.
welcome to hollywood!
it was a tough day for the judges, but they did manage to find a handful of people to send to hollywood.
welcome to hollywood, David!
you're through to hollywood. You made it.
I'm going to hollywood.
we're going to hollywood.
day one in charleston, 15 people leaving the south, headed to hollywood, but what will day two deliver?
find out when we come back on American Idol.
coming up, she can fly a plane bigger than a football field.
I fly c-17s for the U. S.Air force.
but will she crash and burn in the audition room? And watch out, Jennifer Hudson
welcome back to Charleston.
beautiful places and smiling faces.
it's day two, and everyone's happy.
sounds like a good day for an audition, and that's a good thing, because the judges weren't impressed
I am expecting better today.
I don't want another day like yesterday.
it hasn't been great yet, charleston, but, uh, I know the south's gonna represent, 'cause I keep saying the south's gonna rise again, you know what I'm saying?
they're gonna be so much better.
so they settled in and hoped for the best.
it was up to air force pilot Lindsey Goodman to get day two off the ground.
welcome to Charleston air forcbase, and this is a c-17.
Hi, I'm Lindsey Goodman, and I fly c-17s for the U. S.Air force.
I decided to go in the air force because my dad was an air force pilot in Vietnam.
he loved flying, and I just grew up around airplanes my whole life.
there's a lot of preparation that goes into getting ready to go into and out of Iraq, Afghanistan.
we're transport planes.
we transport troops, tanks, helicopters, medical evacuations of patients, you name it.
when you're inside the cockpit, you feel like this is my space, and I know what I'm doing with this, this, this, and this.
but when you land and you actually step outside and you look up, you're like, oh, my lord, I can't believe I just landed that.
it gets you every time.
my squadron mates and my friends in the military all over the years have been like, "you need to try out when you have time. You have to, you have to, you have to.
if she sings as well as she flies, she'll go far in life.
I grew up wanting to do two things, fly and sing, so I got to fly and I got to check that box, and now I'm getting to live out another one of my dreams.
here we go, clear for takeoff.
Hi, Lindsey.
Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey. How are you?
good, how are you?
and what do you do, Lindsey.
I fly c-17s, the globemasters, the big, huge, gray planes that you see flying back and forth.
I never would have guessed in a million years.
well, thank you.
looking at you, that's what you would have done. Seriously.
well, you'd be surprised.
there's a lot of female pilots in charleston that would put, uh, put some pageant queens to shame.
and what are you gonna sing?
it is Black Velvet by Alannah Myles.
take a deep breath.
Yeah, relax. Shake it out, shake it out.
okay, lindsey, thank you. Randy.
um, I liked it. It had a couple of pitch things.
pretty good. You've got a voice.
you definitely have a voice, Lindsey.
I'm concerned that your nerves
I could see the quivering and the--the nervousness, which is something you've gotta beat,'cause it held you back in the performance aspect.
Lindsey, I think you are a very good cabaret singer.
I don't think you are a contemporary recording artist.
um, very cute girl.
performance, song-wise, I don't get it.
yes or no?
Yeah, I gotta say no.
I don't think you're really quite ready.
it's a no, sweetheart. - Okay.
okay, thank you. - Thank you, though.
thank you.
it's a no.
the air force couldn't cut it, so it was time to send in the big guns.
my name is Aretha Codner.
I'm from Buffalo, New York, and I'm 22.
all of my family is originally from Jamaica.
my mother came to this country and first heard Aretha Franklin sing and was just amazed by her voice and said,"you know what?
the next child I have--which was me
she said she was gonna name her after Aretha because she wanted me to sing just like her.
I'm here.
you're here. - Hello.
hello. - Hello.
how are you? - Great.
um, uh, so what's your name? Aretha...
and you were named after the great...
Yes, I was. - Aretha Franklin.
Yes.
right, and who are you as good as?
I'm as good as Fantasia and all the other idols that are out right now.
I am as good.
as good, oh, yeah. - Okay.
okay, and what are you gonna sing?
Whitney Houston, I have nothing. - Good.
okay.
okay, okay.
Aretha, can I be honest with you? Right.
the funny blue dress, the huge belt, the screaming, it didn't work, and the singing was terrible-- and the singing was terrible.
Oh, I have a beautiful voice.
no, you do not have a beautiful voice, Aretha. - I do have a beautiful voice.
Aretha, you murdered that Whitney Houston song. - My voice is amazing.
it is amazing. - To who?
to my family, to people that don't even know me.
I stop crowds.
Yes, I bet. - I do, I stop crowds.
people listen to me, because they're just like,"wow."
you mean the crowd disappears when you sing?
you know what? They come a little closer.
holding anything?
Oh, Simon.
no, Aretha, come on.
you seriously murdered the Whitney Houston song.
no. - You did.
I think I did a good job.
no, it wasn't good. - I think I did a great job.
you know, Aretha- - It wasn't good, pitch problems.
honestly, the pitch, you were--you changed keys and honestly
I think I really did good with that song.
Aretha, you can't sing.
I can sing.
I'm not even gonna hear that.
I love your confidence.
I am, I'm confident because
all right, Randy- - I like the belt.
yes or no?
I like the belt, but no, you weren't good enough today baby.
I'm gonna have to pass.
right, it's a no. - It's a no.
that means it's a no, it's finished.
thank you, Aretha.
I almost don't even believe this, because I really can sing.
I really can sing, and I heard a lot of the people that you did let through here.
I heard a lot of people,'cause that was my strategy, to hear other people sing and how they sung the song.
Aretha, nothing is gonna- - And they weren't even that--you know,
I mean, some of them was good, don't get me wrong, - but some of them was really not up to par. - Aretha, Aretha, Aretha, Aretha, good-bye.
thank you, Aretha. - Good looking out.
I don't--I don't even believe that.
well, it's happened.
can I get one more chance? - No!
I can't sing a Carrie Underwood song that I just learned? - No, aretha, it's over.
Aretha, it's over.
Yeah, yes, no, no, yes, yes, no.
is she married? Her poor husband.
just heard. Just heard. - Yeah, they got...
bad opinions on music, totally.
why did you keep mentioning the belt?
Well,'cause it was huge.
honestly, I think I'm great.
I have a wonderful voice.
I know I do.
and not only do I have a wonderful voice, but my voice is mature.
well, maybe, you know, maybe they're hearing something different.
I don't know what they're hearing.
not feeling any respect, aretha heads home.
it was now up to Joshua Bosun to bring the low country back up to par.
uh, um, god, um...
I can sing something else.
it wasn't a great audition, Joshua.
well, I haven't had any voice training or anything like that.
dawg, you've got a voice, but it ain't good enough.
I don't have a good voice?
it ain't good enough.
well, guess what?
y'all should have never, ever come to south Carolina, 'cause this is what you gonna get.
joshua, you've got a great attitude.
this show is fake and rigged.
what did you say?
fake and rigged, because I can sing.
I knew I was gonna get cut. I told everybody that.
joshua, you are rude and deluded.
I'm not rude and deluded. - You are.
well, I'll just leave it at that,'cause I'm a good person, and you're not.
joshua, I think that, um, I think you've got a lot of personality, but it wasn't the best audition.
so yes or no?
based on up here, I'm gonna have to pass, but I
give me a break.
I did not make it, and they say I can't sing.
they said nobody here can sing, basically, in south Carolina.
no, they didn't say that, did they?
Yeah, they said, they have no talent in south Carolina.
it's been on every news station that south carolina sucks.
I have a feeling the guy's really gotten mad.
american ULIdol sucks.
the judges sucks, not American Idol.
the judges suck.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah remember, they cut this.
anybody out there looking for talent, it's Josh Bosun.
you will see me.
my talent is too big for this competition to hold.
I'm not looking to be the next American Idol, really.
I'm looking to be the next world idol.
so guess what? The joke is on them.
they won't have the best artistses that made it off American idol.
thanks for the opportunity.
you're welcome, Joshua.
coming up, charleston fights back.
american idol.
and Oliver returns with a special delivery.
welcome back to Charleston.
it's 4: 00, and the auditions continue.
the judges had high hopes for day two, but the contestants had other ideas.
no, Yyra.
yet another disappointed face came through the door.
in fact, the city could be summed up in one word.
no.
no.
american idol.
no, no, no
I'm gonna say no.
pardon me - no - excuse me - no may I stay, can I go no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no.
Randy called me a disney character.
Randy said I sound like a chipmunk.
I refuse to cry,'cause like, why?
they wouldn't even give me a chance.
no, no, no
Oliver and his wife had had a much more productive time.
he's been given a second chance to audition, but this time, he's a new man.
I'm Oliver Himan, I'm 27 years old.
I'm from Cornelius, north Carolina, and I'm a new daddy.
she's a great little baby, and she was born at 8: 03.
I mean, could you have timed this better, because this is a big deal for him.
this is really important, this american idol thing. - I know, I was like, oh, no.
this isn't good.
you hope everything goes well, you know, when you're going in front of the judges, but, you know, there's other things that you need to take care of as well, so hopefully Randy, Simon, Paula, they hear it.
Yes, sir.
27 years old. - Don't laugh too much, Randy.
and your wife went into labor.
the morning of the audition, I got a phone call.
she says,"hon, my water broke. I kinda gotta go to the hospital.
and like, I got her, and we went down, and at 8: 03, we had a baby, so...
what's her name?
Aw, that's beautiful. Congratulations.
well, thank you. I appreciate it.
all right, Oliver, what are you gonna sing?
I'm gonna sing "get here." - Oh, cool.
you guys ready? - Ready.
Oliver, Oliver, this is so over the top, all this warbling and the weird falsetto.
it's just corny, old-fashioned, not very good.
bad vibrato, dude, and the whole thing was just really
okay.
it was killing you, man, plus, I mean, when you do that, your voice gets really small, the sound changes.
there's a lot of problems. - So be more loud, be more loud, okay.
Oliver, I think you really do have a nice voice, but it didn't work in the audition.
okay, okay.
Randy, yes or no?
I gotta say no. - Paula.
I want to say yes, but I'm gonna have to say no.
sorry.
you guys want to at least see my baby?
Yes, let's see that baby. - Is that okay?
bring that baby in here. - She's cute as a button, so...
such a nice guy.
Hey, al, come here a minute. Okay.
look how beautiful.
I feel like this is my baby.
in a strange way, I do.
it's an idol baby. I love that.
Oh, my gosh, she's beautiful. - How cute.
thank you very much. - Emma Grace?
Oliver, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
glad to see you, man.
Alison, congratulations. - Thank you very much.
congrats, aLAlison.
good luck this season, guys.
Emma Grace, rock on. - Thank you. Bye.
so we'll be seeing her in 15 years. - Yeah, right?
only if you're still here, Simon.
Aw, that's sweet.
I want to change my mind.
we have a great story to tell when she grows up, so...
even though Oliver didn't make it to hollywood, he still has a reason to celebrate.
and that was it.
thank you, everybody.
it wasn't easy, but from a crowd of 12, 000, the judges picked a total of 23 contestants to join us in the next round.
welcome to hollywood!
Hollywood, here they come.
right here.
tomorrow night, we head to the corn belt, Omaha, Nebraska.
welcome to Nebraska!
where we'll discover new talent.
we want to see you at the final.
Oh, my god!
and I try my hand at the judges' table.
how do I pretend to be overpaid for doing no work?
then things just get weird.
are you gonna hit me?
it's gonna be a scream.
next week...
12 hours on a plane and a bus--I'm here!
the drama unfolds on and off the stage, As our contestants endure the rigors of hollywood week.
tonight we bring you our final auditions from the road.
and we have saved some of the very best...
and some of the very worst auditions for last.
this is American Idol.
it's not easy auditioning for American Idol.
you have to hang around in line for days and brave the elements,
only to be lost in a sea of 10, 000 faces.
and everybody's there for the same reason.
I'm the next American idol!
I'm the next American idol!
I am the next American idol!
or so Luke Reider thought.
everything was slightly mad,
from the massive T-shirt...
to the eyes.
everything was just...mad.
and Luke wasn't the only one to find out that different wasn't always better.
song was kind of like a...
a sheep, or
like an animal.
yeah
Amy Davis hoped her voice would stand out from the crowd
for more human reasons.
making it to hollywood could change her family's future.
growing up with a family lower than lower middle class
has given me an extreme drive and ambition to change that.
I grew up watching my mom work two jobs, six kids.
being a single parent a lot of the time.
I'd just like to...do what i can to pay her back for all the hard work she did.
Hello, how are you?
you're in a very good place right now.
you are in a fantastic place right now.
Yes, I know.
and nice shoes!
thank you!
you're very pretty.
what is your ethnic background?
my grandmother on my mom's side is japanese.
and you're 25 years old, so you can do this.
Yeah.
very nice.
what are you gonna sing for us?
thank you.
Simon, yes or no?
Yes.
thank you.
Randy, yes or no?
I like the possibility of the vocals with this girl.
I think she
that's exactly what I was thinking.
I think she could actually, if she got over the nerves,
you came to hollywood, you'd learn some bigger repertoire of songs,
you would change and make things better, right?
Yeah, absolutely.
I have a large repertoire
if we let you come to hollywood.
please let me come to hollywood.
okay, then, i'm gonna say yes if you're gonna work that hard.
okay. Oh, definitely.
Amy, that means you're through to hollywood.
welcome to hollywood.
well deserved.
Amy, congratulations.
so Amy is on her way.
Tiffany Mccampbell was quietly confident that her talent could
carry her to hollywood too.
after all, her voice was a gift from god.
I've been singing ever since church choir.
and actually, the whole spirit would just tell me to go ahead and audition.
my pastor always said at church my voice is more maturing.
I'm still trying to train up my voice, and it's just gotta get that tone.
I kinda did that in vocal--vocal lessons.
God gave me this gift of singing, and it's just something about me that's unique.
I wanna show the world about it.
so be prepared,'cause here i come.
Hey, hey, hey.
hello.
Hi.
welcome to the fun room.
Hello, how you doing?
okay. Where would you say your voice came from?
well, my voice came from god.
Yes! Amen, sister.
praise god.
he just decided one day to give it to you.
Yes.
Nothing--nothing more to do.
just give Tiffany a voice.
okay, and what are you going to sing?
I'm going to sing "hallelujah."
of course, of course. - okay.
does he have a returns policy?
Oh, Simon, that's wrong.
I'm sorry, but if I was given that, I'd give it back.
you can't give things back.
they're blessings.
well, I'd lose it then.
I mean...this is not the best present in the world, is it?
I'm sorry, Tiffany, I'm not being rude, but you can't sing.
Yeah, Tiff, it wasn't good, baby.
it wasn't there.
wasn't good, man.
sorry, sweetheart.
thank you for coming down.
thank you.
even though tiffany couldn't convert the judges,
maybe an encore performance in the holding room will help everyone
see the light.
maybe not.
coming up...an idol love triangle.
I have the same girlfriend, for the most part.
but is she more interested in Simon?
as long as you put me through to hollywood, you can have whatever you want.
and America meets Cardin.
welcome back to our last audition show.
Hey, American Idol, here I come!
this season, two seemed to be the magic number.
we're gonna be the next American idols.
be the first time in history that two people ever made it through.
as well as bffs, we saw boyfriend and girlfriend,
husband and wife.
but for the first time in idol history, we saw a love triangle.
Hi, I'm Corey.
Hi, I'm Chris.
Hi, I'm Ashley.
we're the Lane twins.
from Kernersville, north Farolina.
we drive the same car, hang out with the same friends,
and have the same girlfriend for the most part.
my name's Ashley Lowing, and I'm from Lincolnton, north Carolina, and I'm 19 years old.
first off, I met Chris Lane, and I started hanging out with him.
we went dancing and everything.
he could dance really good.
and then Corey starts calling me behind Chris's back.
I'll explain it in better terms
Oh, my god, don't even
let me just say this.
he takes all my leftovers.
Yeah, right.
you know, he had been talking like he didn't really like her that much.
and I was like, well, man, I mean, she's extremely hot.
I might get with her.
then I started hanging out with Corey, and we've been together for a year now.
you know which one you're in love with?
that one.
Yeah, how do you tell the difference?
they look nothing alike to me.
he's the cuter one, obviously.
and the better singer.
Yeah, baby, yeah.
yo, rockin' it in twos.
that's right.
I'm Chris.
and I'm Corey.
we heard that the Brittenum twins made it through, and we got a little something for 'em.
all right.
okay, guys, it was very amateurish, if i'm being honest with you.
Really?
Yeah, it was.
you gotta work on not falling apart when you forget something.
you gotta just keep going and keep going, keep going.
I think you guys are charming together, I really do.
but it's not--it's a no for this, though.
all right.
good lookin' out.
all right.
they must have so much fun with the chicks, those two.
nobody got a golden ticket?
no. I messed up, like, twice.
you seem shocked.
uh, yeah.
stunned.
Yeah. They should have made it through without a doubt.
both of them?
Yes!
all right, sorry you didn't make it.
you still have, you know, you have one more in the family here that could make it through.
that's right.
what is this?
my baby.
Hi, baby!
how old is this puppy?
six weeks.
what kind of puppy is this?
it's a pomeranian.
what's your name?
I'm Ashley.
Hi, Ashley.
what's your dog's name?
panda.
panda's so cute!
I'm going to steal your dog.
as long as you put me through to hollywood, you can have whatever you want.
uh, don't say that quite just yet.
okay, uh...
okay, so, Ashley, you're here because you think that you possibly could be the next American idol?
not think.
I know I can.
you know you can?
Oh, definitely.
I have confidence.
what song will you be singing today?
it's "red high heels," but I'm saying 'black,'
cause I have on black ones 'cause Panda tore up my red high heels.
panda can do what he wants.
I think that she actually thinks that she's good, but i don't know...
Ashley, can I be honest with you?
no.
it was excruciating.
Excruciatin?!
Yes.
and you're holding her dog.
even though I'm holding your dog and I love your dog,
it was honestly--it was torture.
Oh, my gosh, you're lyin'.
no, I'm not.
we kinda told her that her voice was up to par just so she would try out.
but she's not that great.
is today opposite day?
no, today is not opposite day.
and it's not groundhog day either.
I mean, even your dog is struggling to get out the room right now.
Oh, no, he's struggling to come to me.
no, he's not.
not after that, he's not.
trust me.
he's like saying, "adopt me, Simon, don't make me go back.
it was terrible!
I think she thinks her looks are gonna take her to the top...
you are one of those girls who, throughout your life, is always gonna get your own way.
is there something wrong with that?
it's a very, very good thing.
my guess is she's not makin' it.
Randy, yes or no?
I gotta say no.
it was really bad.
yes?
Ashley, you're cute, you're a sweetheart, but...no.
the dog is through to hollywood.
no, I would put Panda through, but Ashley, no.
panda goes through in flying colors.
no. Thank you very much, sweetheart.
well, it's nice seeing y'all.
be nice to that dog.
don't take it out on Panda.
anyway, you are absolutely gorgeous.
thank you.
Bye. I love you, Simon.
I know.
I made it!
I'm just kidding, I didn't.
they're dumb.
they don't know talent.
we didn't make it through, but at least we still have each other.
that's all that matters.
so it takes more than just attitude and flirting to get to hollywood.
where would that leave Cardin Mckinney?
I'm very confident.
and I think that's what it takes.
I think that's what really gets people through this business in general.
I think--I think we're going to hollywood.
Hello, how are you? Welcome.
good, how are you?
thank you.
uh, what's your name?
my name is Cardin Mckinney.
and you're 20, you're from Nashville, Tennessee. - I am.
what do you do there?
I'm a server, actually, a waitress at a fondue restaurant.
so you're here because you're an amazing singer.
you're gonna prove it to us today right here?
Yes, sir.
on that little stage right there.
what are you gonna sing?
I'm singing "one night" only from dreamgirls, actually.
all right, here you go.
let's do it.
okay.
okay, you come over as a...very theatrical singer. - I do?
I don't think you're a contemporary recording artist.
you don't?
no, I don't.
you definitely can sing.
it's a very mature voice.
okay, Randy, yes or no?
uh...I'm gonna say yes to Cardin.
I like her voice.
I think she can be more.
I think she can grow in this and really become something.
Cardin, I'm gonna say no.
okay.
you're through. Go.
welcome to hollywood, Cardin!
Congratulations.
thank you so much.
this means...this is the biggest moment of my entire life, to be very honest.
the biggest moment.
coming up...from Madison square garden to our audition room.
if you sung at the garden, man--whoo!
you must be hot!
and an introduction to Dolly Parton.
do you guys know "islands in the stream"?
what's the song called again?
welcome back.
so far this season, we've seen pageant queens...
I'm currently miss South Florida fair.
Wrestlers...
and model citizens.
one day, I would like to become the governor of Oklahoma.
and now, a plus-size model.
my name's Joanne Borgella.
I'm 25.
I live in Hoboken.
being a plus-size model is absolutely amazing.
it's great that i'm able to represent the average-size woman.
growing up, I didn't see that.
I didn't see plus-size models anywhere.
and I hope I can influence others to be happy with themselves.
all my life I've been told, you know, "you need to lose weight."
you've got an amazing voice.
you should lose like 30, 40 pounds, then maybe then you could really become a singer.
and I never let any of that bring me down.
I'm very proud of the way I look.
I'm ready, I'm really ready.
so I'm excited.
Hey, guys.
what's going on?
Joanne, what's your last name?
and you're 25, from Hoboken, New Joisey.
Yes.
it says that you sang the national anthem at the...
Madison square garden.
for what kinda game, basketball?
it was for the college championship basketball games.
and I performed it.
it was sold out that night.
you know, it's a cappella, so you can't remix the anthem.
Paula and i were just saying if you sung at the garden, man, whoo!
you must be hot!
Oh, goodness.
I mean, no pressure.
no, no, no pressure at all.
so what you singing today?
I'm singing Celine Dion, "I love you."
all right, come on.
okay.
thank you.
what do you think, Paula, of Joanne?
Joanne, I think you are stunning.
I think that you have beautiful tone, quality, effortless.
I see that size has always been an issue for you, and I think you're stunning.
you like her voice?
I-I-I do love--I love your voice.
I don't think that that was my favorite song.
you loved her voice.
I think you have a very beautiful, unique sound to you.
thank you.
it's funny, that voice comin' out of you, but you can definitely sing, though.
it just gets so small in the upper register.
Really?
it's interesting, but you can sing, though,
I have a feeling you have a lot of different sounds that come out of you.
I do.
well, so yes or no, Simon?
no.
Yes.
I say yes too.
welcome to hollywood!
love you guys, I love you.
you're gonna have to come with different sounds.
I will.
I will come with every sound you would like.
all right, Joanne, welcome to hollywood, baby.
I love you all!
"oyall."
I like the "oyall."
Bye!
Yes! Yes!
I liked her, though.
she's a nice girl.
you're going to hollywood.
how many people do you plan on taking with you?
I don't know--oh, you're all going!
you're going!
Joanne was on her way.
all right, we're gonna--this is where I embarrass myself.
hot on her heels was 19-year-old Alicia Stauss from California.
I've been singing since I was eight.
singing means everything to me.
I'm born to do this.
I describe my voice as unique, different, not like anybody else.
what are you gonna sing?
"surrender" by Celine Dion.
great.
okay, Alicia.
where do you sing?
um, i take lessons at talent boot camp.
by who?
right, okay, well someone's just lost his job.
and what happens when you sing publicly, Alicia?
um...
everybody likes it.
like...They love it.
what's the reaction?
they love it.
I get people's attention.
I'm sure you do.
Alicia, can I be honest with you?
it was an absolutely dreadful audition.
notes were all over the place.
it was painful.
I couldn't recognize the song.
Yeah, completely wrong song for you too.
I'm not gonna say it was dreadful.
I don't think it was dreadful.
what are you gonna say, Paula?
I think that when you're not pushing forward and empowering your voice, you have a really pretty...
you should have sung a Dolly Parton song.
exactly.
you sound like Dolly.
you've got that quality that is--and that's a likeable quality.
you think she sounds like Dolly Parton.
she has that kind of tone, that kind of vibe.
so you think she sounds like Dolly Parton.
sing some dolly for us right now.
I know you know some.
she may not know Dolly.
what? Come on!
okay, I tell you what.
go and learn a dolly parton song, and come back.
okay.
honestly, because you have a nice tone in your voice.
whenever you're ready, we'll do Dolly Parton.
Yeah, go and learn a Dolly Parton song.
sing here I go again or here I come.
okay.
or "islands in the stream."
whenever you're ready.
I don't think she knows very many Dolly Parton songs.
what time?
I don't know.
nine to five.
Oh, nine to five, that's right.
she's got a nice tone.
Yeah, it's dolly, very Dolly.
it's very hello, Dolly!
so you have your marching orders.
let's pick a Dolly Parton song.
learn the lyrics, go back, and see the judges.
okay, good luck.
you all right?
okay, I'm gonna leave you alone.
you need anything?
no.
okay, it's all you--support.
we'll be right back on American Idol.
can she pull it off?
stay with us.
after the break, will Alicia prove Simon wrong?
where should we go from here?
Plus, the wow factor from Jay Smoove.
okay, so what song did you learn?
which Dolly Parton song?
do you guys know "islands in the stream"?
is it--what's the song called again?
who knows "islands in the stream" really well?
got it. Okay.
I think you're gonna do fine.
I think she's practiced well for learning it in such a short amount of time.
it feels good.
I'm ready.
ready to do it.
Oh, welcome back.
hello.
hello. We--well, Paula thought you sounded like Dolly Parton.
we thought you sounded like Dolly Parton.
okay, Randy and Paula thought you sounded like Dolly Parton.
and you've learned a Dolly Parton song.
Yeah.
good. Which one?
great. Okay.
where should we go from here?
I love the tone of your voice.
no, but I thought that was good--I liked the tone.
don't we like the tone, Paula?
I love the tone.
I love Dolly Parton.
Yeah, I love Dolly too.
so Simon, yes or no?
no, no, no, this is not my audition anymore.
no, no, no, this is
I say yes.
completely up to you two.
I like the tone of your voice too.
I thought it was really sweet, and she's got a sort of pure innocence about her.
so yes or...
I say yes, so guess what that means.
Simon's not even voting
guess what that means.
you're going to dollywood.
welcome to dolly--hollywood!
learn more songs and use that voice.
no, no, no, just buy some Dolly Parton records.
it's pretty incredible that you just--you've never heard that song before?
no. ever.
and you just went and learned it...and you got it.
I hate to admit it.
you were right.
she sounds like--yeah, of course you would say that now.
I love it--he goes,"i hate to admit it, but you're right.
she does, she sounds like Dolly Parton.
I was really disappointed.
that was wild.
she does!
that wasn't the ending I wanted.
that was awesome.
I was like going,"this is the first time it's worked out!
Exactly!
she thought she sounds like Dolly!
that was funny.
welcome to dollywood.
Oh...it's the first time it's ever worked out...
you're like,"huh? Whoa!"
wait a minute!
really disappointed.
all right, whoo!
Yeah!
a sound-alike performance worked for Alicia.
other contestants had to put their own spin on things.
take, for instance...
it ended for me when the weird striptease started.
I knew it.
and then the terrible singing.
it was all...here we go again.
it's hot in here.
and Charles Levener tried wooing the judges with some creative jargon.
Yes, when we decide to put the show out at 3: 00 in the morning,
you can come--you can come and enter.
dressed and ready for the nightlife was Jay Smoove.
well, my name is Joshua Moreland.
my aka is Jay Smoove.
and I'm an R & B recording artist.
when people hear me sing, you know what?
they say it's the "wow" factor.
I mean, the wow factor is like
are you serious?
uh...Yeah.
we need to sign him or try to sign him.
if you're not a performer, get out of my stage, please!
Wow! The ladies.
I definitely cater to the women.
always have roses for 'em.
I slow it down, I speed it up for 'em.
they show a lotta love, a lotta love in so many different ways.
I'm very confident that the judges are gonna put me through.
they gonna be like,"Jay Smoove, Joshua, whatever your name is, you're going through to hollywood.
everybody else go home.
I'm gonna be doing an original song for you here today.
original song.
and, uh, the song is called "beautiful lady."
and, uh, you guys ready?
is this directed to Paula Abdul?
this is definitely going to Paula and every lady
not directed to you.
and every lady across the world.
every little
let me take off my hood.
let me be proper and...
very proper.
very nice, okay.
that was catchy.
Oh, my god.
we'll be singing that tomorrow, won't we?
you love goin' up real high.
Yeah. Yeah, I like to give a little bit more.
like that helium, man.
no, I got to man, got to.
you got to?
there'll be about 10, 000 dogs outside this hotel when we leave tonight.
Yeah.
well, Joshua, I thought what you brought and the accoutrements and all that was very...sparkly.
it's a combination of glitter, sparkles, rose petals-- you don't think it was a bit corny?
no, for the ladies.
Yeah, the ladies love the glitter, Josh.
joshua, can I be honest with you?
it was a horribly over-the-top, corny, revolting audition.
really.
I mean, it really was--the sparkle, the flowers, the sunglasses, the looking around
it was all over-the-top, corny.
I hated it.
if i'm being honest.
okay, I appreciate that, sir.
okay, Randy, yes or no?
man, I think you got a voice, but I don't think you're ready yet.
I'm gonna say no.
please, please, please.
Paula.
joshua, I appreciate what you did here, but it's not--I'm sorry, I'm gonna pass.
I'm afraid it's a no, Josh.
thank you.
Nope.
why didn't they feel ya?
I don't know.
Paula, can you just sweep it up, please?
y-yeah, whatever.
Yeah.
we need Ryan in here to sweep it up.
Ryan. - yes.
come here a sec.
Yeah.
Ryan, can you come and sweep up?
just sweep it up.
off you go.
cause we've gotta hurry up.
you know, I would feel uncomfortable without letting you do your job.
that was patronizing.
that was patronizing, Ryan.
patronizing to a woman.
sorry that he's trying to take your work from you.
are we still on camera?
let me do that for you.
come on.
?? Oh, it's so awkward!
look at--it's so awkward, him doing that!
I don't think he's ever done this in his life!
Oh, my god, he doesn't even know how to hold it right!
what do I do with this?
he's never done this in his life!
Oh, yeah!
Simon, it's called a broom.
Yep.
it's called a broom.
do you know what this is called?
I apologize if he was patronizing with you and rude.
wow, this is crazy.
but I'd like to offer you a job.
now you're being even more patronizing.
off you go.
you do some more housework, Simon.
okay. Again, really apologize about Ryan's disgraceful behavior.
okay, the cameras are off.
Oh, the cameras are off.
right, it's all yours.
coming up, what's in a name?
so it's Kiana Dim.
I'm sorry, beg your pardon.
Diana Kim, right?
and Chikezie Eze gets a second chance.
welcome back.
over the last few weeks, we've seen Simon lose his temper.
and we've seen him lose his patience.
the tightness that you were feeling opened up a little bit.
Oh, come off it, Paula!
let's face it.
he's not getting any younger, and now he's starting to lose his mind.
we're on the west coast, yeah?
it's east coast, south Carolina.
where are we?
welcome to Atlanta.
is that where we are?
that's where you are.
his biggest problem this year has been names.
she says Kaina.
you're a little tiger, aren't you, Dena?
that's right, correct him.
that's why I spell my name with a capital "A."
it's Italian.
not hippo-like.
Gurgurich, yes.
it's kinda like it's...
it's not Gurge.
so it's Kiana Dim.
I'm sorry, beg your pardon.
Diana Kim, right?
I'm completely dyslexic today.
he's dyslexic today.
you're not Jessica Brown, are you?
no, sir.
or was he just playing?
I'm gonna see if I can get every single name wrong today.
every one.
every single name wrong today.
that's my favorite thing that he does.
Yes.
damn.
so when we had a contestant with a name like Chikezie Eze, he didn't even try.
he's back!
close enough.
no, last year.
last year.
last year?
and what happened?
um, you wasn't feelin' me.
so you ready to change that.
Yeah. What you think i'm here for?
Oh, yeah, it's on, it's on!
all right.
so what you gonna sing, dawg?
I'm gonna sing "all the woman I need" by Luther Vandross.
you better be good, Chikezie.
Yeah, come on, Chikezie.
thank you very much.
thank you.
Simon, what did you think of Chikezie this time?
well, I think you--you're interesting.
I'm not sure your voice is that interesting.
should I do another song?
no, I got you on that song.
I think, you know...
I know all about you now.
I hmm. Interesting.
do think you have an interesting voice, and i do think you're talented.
thank you so much.
okay, Randy, yes or no?
sometimes persistence, working hard, really, really wanting something
that determination pays off, and it did just now for Chikezie and
a ticket to hollywood!
I will never forget that name--Chikezie Eze.
this is the second time around.
I gotta do it right this time.
coming up...
one last contestant.
will Danny Noriega take the final golden ticket?
I'm ready, and I'm ready to
knock them out with my voice.
Plus, a look back at our audition highlights...
I think your dad will be very proud of you.
Oh, my god!
and low lights...
I'm a dork!
Oh, my god, now I'm gonna be on the rejects!
welcome back.
the last contestant of the audition tour is no stranger to the process.
Danny Noriega buckled under the pressure last season, but has come back stronger.
last year was intense.
there's no other word to describe it.
nerves had taken over me, and...
unfortunately, I was eliminated.
I think, actually, everything happens for a reason
and this happened for a reason to show me the experience to come back and win it.
I'm ready.
I'm ready to knock them out with my voice.
hello.
I remember you.
I remember you too.
wow, Danny, what's up?
nothing much.
just trying to keep my nerves down.
what do you think happened?
what do you think happened last time?
Ugh! A lot.
bad song choice, one.
and my nerves just...whop.
you have a good voice.
I remember that.
thank you.
okay, what are you gonna choose to sing?
I'm gonna sing "proud mary."
of course.
okay.
it's always the voice that comes out of this body that I
you've got a very good voice, Danny.
thank you very much, Simon.
more confident, if that's possible, this year.
I'm just trying to be myself more.
last year, I was so not myself.
no, no, I get that.
I get that.
but I thought it was a really good audition.
I think it's one of the best I've seen.
I loved it.
I was like, yeah, what?
Danny, it's--it's very interesting, and you know, you know who you are.
and what makes us kinda go
Oh, my god, it's just not--not expected to have that voice come out of you.
it's very different.
nice control.
you've got a gift, Danny.
very impressive, Danny.
that is three yeses.
welcome to hollywood, Danny boy!
I'm going to hollywood!
Yes. This is what I needed.
a second chance.
so for Danny, it's paid off to audition again.
he's earned another golden ticket and another chance for stardom.
well, it's over.
from sevencities and over 100, 000 contestants, the auditions finally have come to an end.
and the judges could not be happier.
do you think we found the next American idol?
I just wanted to keep doing it. I love it.
Yeah!
I can't do that.
it's against the rules!
I've kissed a girl today.
I'm a dork!
Oh, my god, now I'm gonna be on the rejects.
Oh, my god!
take it, take it, take it!
I love America!
Douglas, they're gonna take you somewhere safe.
I'm going to hollywood!
I'm going to hollywood!
welcome to hollywood,
both of you!
I can't split you two up.
you guys look like a couple.
I think this is my year.
I hope.
it's not about fame for me.
it's about my baby girl.
to get somewhere, you gotta give up some stuff sometimes.
so I'm willin' to do it.
I think your dad will be very proud of you.
well, those are the auditions for this year, and they never disappoint, do they?
coming up next week, from this stage it is hollywood week.
one word--intense.
we've combed the nation,
this country
and from
just 164
Hello, hollywood, we are here!
for the biggest opportunity of their lifetime.
somebody here is gonna be the winner of American Idol.
now, the competition begins.
in the past, you've seen the drama.
I don't do groups.
that wasn't the song.
Hey, don't you shout at me.
we're not gonna be friends after tomorrow.
your persona's not original.
but this year, it's all about the music...
y'all about to be entertained.
this is heaven.
new twists...
listen to me
what do you wanna do now?
new turns...
and new ways to play the game.
some of you are playing instruments.
let's see if that works.
we promised you the best, and now we're about to deliver.
but one thing has stayed the same.
the judges will be ruthless
on the contestants...
that bored me to tears.
you never know what they gonna say.
and on each other.
do you wanna judge the show?
no, I'm--I'm sticking up for you on this.
I'm gonna say no.
I can't - are you sure?
next week,
you'll witness some of the greatest performances
to ever grace our hollywood stage.
it was incredible.
Wow! Quite impressive.
you look like a star.
just when they thought they knew it all...
Oh, I'm so ready.
it's time to face the music.
who will make the cut?
I just wanted a chance, you know?
join us next tuesday to find out.
if we don't think you're good enough,
it's over.
last year, over 97 million votes were cast in our biggest finale ever.
of course, David Cook is the champion.
we've come back now to his home turf to see if the "show me" state can show us the next American Idol.
have we found one here in Kansas city?
may 9th, 2008.
american Idol hits Kansas city to honor hometown hero David Cook.
that day 7, 000 people came out to support their future American idol.
six months later, would they show up again to try it for themselves?
I think that's a yes.
by 8: 00 A. M.It seemed like the entire town showed up, and the energy was the most enthusiastic we've ever seen.
american Idol in Kansas city.
Oh...freaking...yeah!
with over 11, 000 in the crowd, everyone had their mind set on exactly who they wanted to impress.
Simon makes American Idol.
I love you, Simon.
Simon says...
pick me.
but he didn't get all the love.
Mr. Ryan Seacrest!
Ryan, you're so dreamy!
once inside the stadium, everyone was eager to get down to business.
are you ready, Kansas city?!
so we're good to go, but are the judges?
is this Kansas or Missouri?
Missouri!
while simon greets his adoring fans, Kara makes some of her own.
I'm the new fourth judge.
I hope you guys like me.
and when Paula arrived, she had a surprise waiting.
it's Jason Castro.
man, what are you doing here?
well, actually, my brother's here.
Really? -Yeah, so I'm gonna support.
we'll check back with them later.
now, after a last minute briefing...
so, we're judging today.
I thought we were performing.
no, no, we're judging.
the panel is ready to begin all over again.
outside, 19-year-old Chelsea Marquat is ready to represent for the girls of Kansas city.
I've been singing as long as I can remember.
I sang when I was in middle school.
in high school, I was in the varsity choir.
and I definitely think this is where I'm meant to be.
I was always afraid to come out for American Idol.
like, I didn't think I was good enough.
my family would always tell me, you know, "Chelsea, you're really, really good.
you should do it," and it just seemed like a dream for me.
hi - hi
you see me , you see the little girl
and also you want me to stop?
Yeah, it was - Got another song? - No.
no, no, no.
I'll tell you what it sounded like.
it sounded like a cat jumping off the empire state building, and the noise it would make before it hit the floor.
if that makes sense. - And then - You are so cruel. - And wait a minute.
then as it hit the floor, there's a siren
all right, guys. - You guys...
stop it now... - Are really, really being bad.
chelsea, this is the - Does that help?
no, it doesn't help.
that doesn't help anybody.
chelsea, take something that's positive in that can help you and do this to him, and that to him.
okay? - Right, so can I just play devil's advocate just for a second?
Yeah, just a second.
all right, what positive things does she take out of this audition?
well, she hasn't been able to hear anything from kara or myself.
so, that's the positive?
well, I wouldn't say that she was a cat coming--I mean
baby, singing's not your thing, no.
no, no. - Here's a positive.
you're a pretty girl. - Yes.
you are not a good singer, sweetie.
I am so sorry.
you are beautiful, and I'm sorry that you had to hear some stuff that was harsh, but it's the way these auditions go, and we have to pass.
okay, it's a no, but thank you.
sorry, honey. - Other way.
funny.
chelsea, what happened?
no ticket? - Actually, no, no ticket.
they said I sounded like a cat falling off a roof or something.
what? - Yeah.
I'm sure she'll never hear that she's a cat falling off the empire state building again in her life.
I think I just picked the wrong songs, you know, so...
how do you feel?
um, I feel like I'm gonna cry.
Oh, I'm sorry. - Thanks.
I know it's tough. - Yeah.
and while a different selection might not have helped Chelsea, Ashley Anderson has done her homework.
she's picking a song by Leona Lewis and co-written by a certain you-know-who.
what are you gonna sing?
good.
great song.
footprints.
what did I say? - Footsteps.
let me do it again. - Yeah.
Oh, do I remember this. - Yeah, good catch.
um, there's a reason why.
probably the best song I've heard the entire audition season.
it's a great song. It's an amazing song.
it's a difficult song to sing.
tough song.
beautiful song, though.
uh, yes, yes, yes.
I like this girl, yes, yes.
thank you.
Yeah, I think you have some chops.
I want to see what you can bring to the show.
Yes.
actually, you got four yeses.
welcome to hollywood! - Thank you so much!
I like you.
that way. - I was like, what?!
did she just - Thank you!
do you think she's ready for this?
Absolutely.
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
think the judges liked her?
if they're smart.
here she is.
Simon wrote it.
he's one of the premiere songwriters. Who knew?
you stacked the deck a little bit, right, - by choosing one of Simon's artists. - I did.
was that part of your plan?
um, somewhat.
did you see it on his face that he was happy?
I saw that--well, he said it was a great song, of course, but-- Next trip is to hollyod, so we'll see you there.
thank you. - Thank you!
Yay! You did it!
over the next two hours, Kansas city unleashes its true talent.
I think you are absolutely fantastic.
very, very soulful.
I think you're one of the best we've seen. - Yep, I do, too.
but later... - I'm not happy.
what turns Missouri into downright misery?
No...no.no.
I hated everything.
No!
david Cook? - Yeah, it's me - Are you - I think so is amazing

welcome back to Kansas city, where it's now midmorning and thousands are still waiting for their shot.
Kansas city rocks!
the midwestern hospitality is overflowing...
hello. How are you all today?
good morning. - Well, hey.
and even Simon's having a good time.
I like Kansas a lot.
maybe he'll like it even more after meeting K. C.Carlson.
come on in. Come on in.
hello. - How are you?
I'm good. How are you guys?
and you are K. C. - Carlson.
K. C. Carlson in K. C.
Yes, and you're twenty years old, and where are you from?
I'm from Minneapolis, Minnesota.
what are you singing?
I'm gonna sing a thousand miles by Vanessa Carlton.
good.
Thanks, K.C. - All right.
I like you. - I do, too. I do, too.
I think you have a nice voice and, uh
you've got a good vibe about you.
I see a package here.
Thanks. - Paula Wbdul?
um, I would love to give you another chance.
that's a yes? - Yes.
Yeah, that was a good call. I like you.
I'm gonna say yes.
Kara? - I'm gonna say yes, too.
I like you.
I say yes, too. Welcome to hollywood, baby.
okay, out you go. - Thank you.
okay. Thank you.
Oh, my god. - You all right?
I'm so excited.
I just--aah!
I can't even believe that it's real right now.
I'm going to hollywood.
group hug, group hug!
so things are coming together in Kansas city.
back out in line, each contestant hopes that their special talent will also impress the judges.
we flip for American Idol.
but Brian Hatler isn't bringing any bells and whistles.
he's relying solely on his instrument.
you know, I'm a big guy with a big heart and a big voice, and I want to do some big old things.
I'm 20 years old, and I'm from Kansas city, Missouri.
I studied classically.
I was trained in opera and that was what I was originally going to go into in college.
I was that kid that practiced hours every night to try and get into a music conservatory.
music was my life and I gave it up,
I just left it completely for two years, so this audition is so important to me today.
it's me returning to music and just knowing that I have a place in this industry.
it's just what I dream of doing for the rest of my life.
Yeah, what's up, man?
not much. How y'all doing?
come on in, Brian.
all right, baby. What you singing?
I'm gonna sing some Aretha, think.
thank you!
Brian, that was definitely, definitely different, dawg.
definitely different.
Simon, what did you think of Brian's difference?
from the horrendous outfit, the horrendous singing, everything was wrong in this audition, Brian.
I mean, seriously wrong.
I hated everything.
I mean, it was just awful.
awful.
and wait a minute, people compare you to Josh Groban?
could I sing some Josh Groban for you?
or Michael Mcdonald.
I'll--I'll sing some Josh Groban for you.
Brian-- No, no, no.
after that, I don't want to hear you sing anything again.
seriously, it was that bad.
okay, it's nothing like - Nothing like Josh Groban. - Not good, dude.
honestly, Brian, I'm surprised th you think you're like these people.
Brian, it was terrible, baby.
come on, man.
you can't hear that, right?
you can't hear what we're hearing?
no. - No?
we're gonna have to pass Brian.
Brian, it's a no.
thank you. - Thanks, man.
are you disappointed?
are you disappointed?
he looks not happy.
not happy.
if you're expecting me to cry on camera, don't even try.
but as morning wore on, others weren't so successful in masking their emotions.
no. No! No!
No!
coming up, it's all on the line in Kansas city.
you get one song, Von, so you make sure you choose the right one.
this is my dream. Please say yes.
I'm gonna say yes.
I'm gonna say no.
and later, we witness an emotional story of strength and courage.
I remember when the doctors pulled me in the room and they said, there's nothing else we can do for you.
it all happens after the break.
welcome back to Kansas city.
the judges very happy with the day so far.
I mean, our expectations were high.
this is where david cook is from.
as a matter of fact, his parents just coincidentally in the shot.
so what should we expect from Kansas city today?
well, I think you'll probably see a lot of talent in here.
I mean, talent as good as a cook or just about as good as a cook?
um, just about as good.
not quite.
but it's not only his mother who's on board.
david has certainly proven he is a force in the music industry.
last year, his signature move was taking well-known songs and making them his own.
next.
so, coming here this year, we were hoping that kind of originality would run in the water.
thank you.
James, you're like a singing Ryan Seacrest, aren't you?
Yes!
let's just say good-bye.
okay, thanks.
sorry, can I start over?
no.
okay, well, let's just change blind to deaf and that song would make a lot of sense.
I mean, seriously, it was terrible.
okay, the outlook for the guys, not so good.
can Von Smith give the men of Missouri a boost?
I am 22 years old, and I'm from Greenwood, Missouri.
my range is a little bit strange because I attempt things that most guys don't attempt to sing.
I'm not afraid to be who I am, so I mean the fact that I'm-- I'm genuine, I feel like that will come across.
I'm hoping that they see the positives in me and don't pick apart everything too much, but who knows?
what are you gonna sing?
well, you get one song, Von, so you make sure you choose the right one.
one song?
excuse the phlegm.
thank you.
after the break, Von Smith finds out his fate...
Randy, what do you think?
and we experience sibling rivalry, Castro style.
he's more, like, girly.
what did you mean by that?
it's all coming up as Kansas city continues.
you made the wrong choice!
Plus, one of the most heartfelt stories we've ever heard on American Idol.
I hate talking about this 'cause it's so painful.
it's still so real, the wound is--it's so deep.
you won't want to miss this audition.
welcome back to idol here in Kansas city.
now, we have seen some talent.
have we seen the best yet?
that remains to be seen because before the break, Von Smith was in the hot seat.
his fate now lies in the hands of the judges.
thank you.
wow, that was powerful.
so Randy, what do you think?
actually, I thought the vocals were pretty good, man.
I think you've definitely got a voice.
you can definitely sing.
uh, I was impressed.
thank you so much.
I like you, Von.
I bet your family love it when you do that.
love it.
um, but I have to tell you, you've got a good voice, Von.
thank you, Simon.
very good. -Paula?
I say absolutely yes.
Yeah, Von, I think you have a really big instrument.
I really do.
and I think that you can take a lot of risks that other singers can't because you have those chops.
I gonna say yes. This guy's definitely got a dope voice.
I'm gonna say yes.
Paula? -Von, you are a very interesting one.
I can't wait to see more of you. Yes.
Von, you've got four yeses.
Congratulations.
welcome to hollywood, baby.
thank you very much.
see you later.
there's a future for you in hollywood, hopefully.
mom, you're about to burst with something.
well, he's just such a great joy, and I'm so glad that you guys get to will hear him some time, so...
Oh, you're sweet.
Hollywood!
so in years past, we have seen contestants bring their brothers or sisters to audition after they've been through.
fantasia brought hers by, he didn't make it.
david cook's brother didn't make it through.
what will happen with Jason Castro's?
who could forget our fourth runner-up from last season?
he had the charm, the good looks, and the chops, but was lacking in another department.
I--I really hate doing interviews.
okay, starting over.
these are terrible answers. I'm so sorry.
third time's the charm.
so, how did little bro Michael compare?
we'll let you be the judge.
my name is Michael Castro.
I'm 20 years old--wait.
I'm 20 years old and what's the other one?
okay.
help me out here, guys. Who knows?
I heard you're pretty good at interviews, just like me.
my brother and I are different because he's more, like, girly, and I'm more not girly.
maybe we shouldn't put that in.
that was probably not good.
you said I was girly?
I--you know, it just came out.
what did you mean by that?
how do you explain it?
like,'cause you get all emotional with the singing and stuff.
I'm a man.
you know, like, the emotional thing you do?
like, I tried to explain it. I don't know if they got it.
okay, so by girly, you mean I have emotions and I know how to express them well.
if that's what you want to call it.
some people call that an artist.
some people might.
we had the pleasure of having your brother last season.
Yeah, man.
why didn't you audition last year?
uh, I didn't sing.
I just started singing, like, 20 days before the auditions.
20 days before the auds? -It's like, if Jay can sing, I can sing, right?
what the hey!
a little competition in the family. -I love this.
so, you think you can do this?
I'm pretty sure I can.
well, let's--let's hear what you're gonna sing.
what are you gonna sing?
I'm gonna sing in love with the girl by Gavin Degraw.
love Gavin Degraw. -It's a great song.
ready?
Ooh, Michael, not bad.
20 days before? -Right. I guess.
pretty cool.
pretty cool. Simon?
Michael, it was--it was... good-ish.
you know, it's not the best-- -It's definitely not bad.
Yeah, it's not bad.
I can't really get anything from your voice at the moment.
I'm never quite sure with you Castros, whether you're really, really into this or not.
I thought that, you know-- I think you can sing.
I think you're--you're kind of a ballsy dude, and I kind of like that about you.
you have this sort of "I have a secret" kind of vibe about you.
do you?
I don't know, he's just-- -Maybe I don't even know it.
and he just comes out here. -He's like, eh, my brother did it, I can do it.
I'll--you know. I kind of like that about you.
it shows chutzpah.
you're fun.
I'm gonna say yes.
and I say yes, yes, yes.
I'm gonna say yes.
you know already, dawg. I say yes. Welcome to hollywood!
way to go.
way to go.
say hi to your brother.
he's a little cocky that guy, huh?
Yeah. Cocky.
wait, Michael, give us that reaction one more time.
Yeah.
that runs in the family.
I know.
I'm blown away.
I never heard him sing in real life.
he's amazing.
I was really impressed.
I, h-- There's a lot of things we don't know about this family we're all gonna learn on American Idol.
we're going to hollywood!
again!
we'll see if Michael will be able to step out from behind his brother's shadow when he hits hollywood.
Oh, come on!
coming up, a cheering section like we've never seen before...
we meet a mom who lost everything...
right now, we're still trying to recover.
can she get it back?
and he has a powerful story...
we never got to say good-bye.
but does he have the voice to match?
very, very soulful.
welcome back idol in Kansas city, where so far it's been a successful trip.
I have a feeling that's all about to change.
hang on. What is this song?
what is going on here, man?
odds are, the judges might find the next contestant a bit more appealing.
my name is Matt Bridesky.
I'm from Bixby, Oklahoma.
I'm 27 years old.
singing for a living's been something I've always wanted to do, but when I got married and had a child, you know, it--it-- it turned into something that was fun but it--it wasn't taking care of my home priorities.
so I put that on hiatus.
took a--a day job.
I love you. -I love you.
me and my wife have always been fans of the show.
we--we've watched it, you know, and, uh, knowing that I sing and play guitar and whatnot, she's like,"you know, that would be really neat if you were a part of that.
she said, if you want to go for this, then do it.
Yeah, what's up, man?
how you doin'?
welcome, welcome.
okay, your name is Matt-- -Bridesky.
okay, and what do you do, Matt?
uh, I'm a welder/fabricator.
okay, so why, doing that, do you now want to do this?
well, actually, I've been singing since I was a little boy, and, uh, I played the bar scene for a long time, and, uh, turns out, you know, I--I got married and now I've got a three-year-old and-- You know, so I--I've got responsibilities, and it's a-- it's--it's a big undertaking being a father, -so I-- -Yeah, I get that.
definitely have to take care of home.
I get that.
okay, um, what are you giggling at?
nothing, Simon. Nothing.
you're just funny, Simon.
Simon's a funny dude.
just a funny guy.
okay, Matt, what are you gonna sing?
uh, Bill Withers, ain't no sunshine.
Yeah, I get that.
all right. Thank you, matt. Randy?
uh, Mat Dude, I think you're probably like, a great father.
you're probably just like a cool bar singer, you know?
you're singing in bars and in the clubs and doing your thing.
I'm not sure it's right for this, man, for me.
you know what?
I don't agree with Randy on this one.
I like you.
thank you. -Something about you I like.
you know, you put a lot of heart into that.
I think you have natural talent.
Yes, you do have natural talent, and I like your --I like the control of your vibrato.
and--and it just--it's--it's a nice tone.
it just is.
okay, we're gonna vote.
Randy, yes or no?
no.
not for me.
I'm gonna say yes.
I say yes.
I have to agree...with the girls.
welcome to hollywood.
Yes, girl power!
I think you are really, really good and I like your heart and I like your ambition.
you're through to hollywood.
Yes, thank you!
thank you so much.
prove me wrong in hollywood, dawg.
I will, I will.
out you go.
well done, Matt.
what does Matt do for a living?
he's a welder.
see, the great thing about this show is that-- Yes!
it doesn't matter what you do.
we're working people.
you know, that's--that's what we do until we retire.
you know, and, uh, but this-- this could mean a lot of things.
it could mean a lot of things. This is amazing.
we'll follow up with Matt when he hits hollywood.
so Kansas city is rockin', but this town is actually more known for Jazz.
and this year, we may have found the perfect girl to continue the legacy.
my name is Jasmine Joseph.
I'm 17, from Norfolk, Nebraska, and I really actually go by "jazz."
that's pretty much my name.
call me jazz.
And--yeah.
I'm here to try out for American Idol.
it's like nothing else exists out of my life other than this right now.
not happy at all. - Not happy at all.
not happy.
and while Jasmine won't see the other side of her rainbow, back out in line, there are still many others looking to follow the yellow brick road to hollywood.
I came all the way from Haysville, Kansas, to be the next American Idol!
some are relying on brains.
we are in...
Kansas city.
some are trying with hearts.
marry me, Simon. Marry me.
but others just need a little courage.
my stomach feels like it's in my throat.
it's like maybe I might throw it up when I sing or something.
there's no place like Kansas city.
but for our next contestant, home was a little closer to OZ.
my name is Jessica Paige Furney. I'm 20 years old from Wamego, Kansas.
my hometown is probably one of the major capitals of the wizard of OZ, which they are very proud of.
I'll be right back, grandma.
um, I live with my 93-year-old grandmother.
these are my crazy pills.
my grandma's really hard of hearing, so when you talk to her, you're kind of yelling at her.
do you know that I sing?
do I what? - Know that I sing?
which makes it fun.
I mean, I take care of her, but she got--has my back whenever i need her to, and I think the challenge is worth it to keep her happy in the home that she's lived in for so long.
I really want to make it to hollywood and I think if there's anything I wanted in life, it would be to be able to do my music for, you know, a living.
hollywood's another step closer to that.
hi
Hi, guys.
what's going on? What's your name?
my name is Jessica Paige Furney.
all right, so what makes you think you're the next american idol, dear?
um, you know, I've worked really hard at music my entire life, and I am willing to work as hard as it takes to get there--to do what I have
all right, what y singing? - I am singing cry baby by Janis Joplin.
all right, do it.
thank you very much. Thank you - All right.
I--Jessica, I like you. - Thank you.
Yeah, I like you. You're a--you're--you stand out.
you know, small-town girl, big dreams--I like that.
thank you.
what I like about you is you're a natural.
I could tell when you walked in, you were speaking to us, like, I bet she's got a nice, natural tone.
got a yes from me, Jessica.
Yes, I like you very much. - Great.
100%. - Thank you.
I say yes, too. Welcome to hollywood, baby!
Thanks! Thank you, guys.
happy birthday, by the way. It's her 20th birthday today. - Happy birthday!
see you guys.
so today is also Jessie's birthday, and here she comes with hopefully a gift for everybody.
I'm going to hollywood, baby!
Yeah!
up next, can these sisters rap their way to hollywood?
okay, I think we've heard enough of that.
this guy may not have dressed to impress...
little bit geeky, the look.
but you'll be blown away by his voice.
you had some crazy vocals jumping off there.
welcome back to Missouri.
it's 2: 30 P. M.And even though the contestants are here to audition...
pick me please!
one perk of waiting in line is meeting new friends.
we just met. She's from Wisconsin. I'm from here, so.
when I walked up to the crowd, I saw something that was so beautiful, and I was like, wow, that's where I have to sit in line today.
we just met this morning. - Yeah.
are you serious? - Yeah.
but then there's the flip side--conttants who came together.
I'm Jamar Rogers.
this is my, uh, brother, as far as I'm concerned.
Yes, sir. Danny Goki.
and we're going all the way togeth, actually, yeah. Yes.
we're going side by side.
but first, a real pair of siblings.
my name is Asia Mcclain. I'm 24, and I'm from Kansas city, Missouri, - and this is my sister. - India Morrison. I'm 22.
my sister dragged me down here to audition.
I did, I convinced her to audition because I thought that she has, like, a billion talents balled up into one person.
Ugh, sister kiss.
are you singing together? - We're rappers.
you're rapping together? - Yeah.
you're looking at the two most talented individuals.
if you ever need a choreographer or
a bodyguard. - Bodyguard.
got it.
Hi, guys.
hi - Hi
right, okay, so, uh, who have we got here?
I'm India. - I'm Asia.
you're sisters? - Yes.
okay, are you both good?
Yes.
who's the better one?
I am.
I like that, India. - That's good. That's sisterly love.
okay, uh, but you're gonna be supportive of each other. - Yes.
what are you gonna sing? It's an original.
it's called cookies.
you wrote it? - It's dedicated to randy.
Yeah. - My dedication.
okay, I've got it.
how was this an ode to randy?
that was good. I like it. It was funny.
my dawg, he loves stuff. You know, he's realistic.
okay, right, who--which one's going first?
I'll go first. Asia.
all right, okay. I think we've heard enough of that. Thank you.
can we have India, darling? Please?
india, what you singin', baby?
okay.
okay, do you know what? I like this girl.
well, she can sing. - I do, I like you.
what do you think, Kara? - I love both of them.
I think they're both great, and I love their--their love for one another.
I think it's really refreshing to see sisters- - Real sisters.
support each other. It's amazing.
and we're not twins, either. We're not.
No! No, come on!
you guys always do the twins thing which--time for a change! Something different.
okay, it's time to vote. It's time to vote.
uh, Asia, no.
well, here we are, standing here.
scared.
uh, I'm gonna say...
please, please.
okay, who's first?
everybody needs sisters like that.
so we're celebrating India's success, but Asia
it's okay, I came- - How are you doing?
I came down to support my sister 'cause this is her dream.
to do everything--dance, sing, choreograph--this is what she wanted.
Oh, my god, I'm so happy. - This is it.
she's a nice lady. - Really nice.
I want a sister like that.
she's the best. - Thank you.
I'm so happy you guys are letting her go to hollywood. This is what I wanted for you, dude, seriously.
so our sister act went one for two.
up next, Wisconsin native Jamar Rogers.
Hi, Jamar. - Hey there.
how are you doing? - Fantastic.
ready to rock? You're a bartender? - Yes, ma'am.
all right. Good, what are you gonna sing?
I'm singing California dreamin' by the mamas and the Papas.
of course.
okay.
thank you - Thank you
you can sing, Jamar. You can sing.
it's just--it got--it- - Too loud.
a little--too loud and--and fell off pitch at times.
it was just a little bit overdone, I think.
I actually thought it was pretty good, man. It was just so over-the-top and so affected a little bit with the faces and all that.
I thought it was quite good. You know, a bit corny.
I'm gonna say yes. - Okay.
I'm gonna say yeah. - Right on.
Yes. - Thank you.
okay, you got a yes from me as well, welcome.
welcome to hollywood, dawg! - Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
along with Jamar's family, his st friend Danny Goki waits to hear his fate.
thank y'all.
that a way. This a way, that a way.
what advice do you have for danny now that he's about to go in there and see the judges?
man, do what you've been workin' on, bro. Do what you've been workin' on. You're gonna kill it.
coming up, it's all on the line for Danny.
you know, I was so close to not trying out because of the grief.
I mean, the grief is so intense.
but will his emotions get the best of him?
you ready for this? You think you can do this?
and later, who gets this comment from jackson?
I think you're one of the best we've seen.
that's what I'm talkin' about.
it's mid-afternoon in Kansas city, Missouri.
28-year-old music teacher Danny Goki has come to audition today, and before the break, his best friend Jamar made it through.
welcome to hollywood, dawg! - Thank y so much. I appreciate it.
but now it's danny's turn, and for him, coming to audition today is nothing short of an emotional sacrifice.
I hate talking about this 'cause it's so painful. It's still so real.
the wound is so--is so deep.
four weeks before the audition, my wife passed away.
she was born with a condition in her heart, and so basically, throughout the years, she had to have surgery after surgery.
and, man, I remember when the doctor
Oh, I remember when the doctors pulled me in the room and they said, you know, there's nothing else we can do for you.
I said, you fight for her. I said, you do whatever it takes.
I said, I'll take care of my part. I will pray.
she was my best friend.
we never got to say good-bye.
you know, I was so close to not trying out because of the grief.
I mean, the grief is so intense.
but I decided I'm gonna go through it because I really believe that people through me can see who my wife was.
hello. - Hello.
what's your name? - My name is Daniel J. Goki.
you're 28? - Yeah.
and you're a music teacher. - Yeah.
what are you gonna sing?
the song I'm gonna sing today is I heard it through the grapevine by Marvin Gaye.
thank you. Man.
very, very soulful.
good, good tonal quality to your voice. - Thank you.
good rhythm. You're in the pocket on--in tune.
I liked you so much. Didn't expect it.
I appreciate that.
I am a fan of you, Danny. I thought that was great.
I really did. I think you've got a lot of heart and soul in you.
I really liked you. Like your voice a lot. - Oh! Thank you.
I think you're one of the best we've seen. - Yep, I do, too.
I was impressed, dawg. - Crazy vocals from Danny--what?!
Yeah, I agree. - Okay, Randy, yes or no?
100% for danny J. - With the crazy vocals.
great vocals.
Paula? - I agree. I think you're one of the best we've heard.
four yeses. - Can I get some knuckle punches?
welcome to hollywood!
man, simon. Well done.
yo, this is a new way. Yes, sir. Explode it.
gotta do this right. Yeah.
What?! - Thank you!
that a way, that a way.
grab your ticket. - I never wanted to be that guy who went the wrong way, and I did.
he was great.
see you later.
really good.
I mean, this is something that's about to happen right here.
and sophia, this one is for you, baby.
come on.- Yes, ma'am.
so it's an emotional victory for Danny.
but as the afternoon wore on, and the line thinned out, things weren't as successful for the girls of kansas city.
okay.- Simon, what are you doing?
it was terrible.
and after a while, it all begins to sound like this...
with the girls falling short, thankfully a guy's up next.
meet Anoup Desai.
so, Anoupie-- It's-- What?
It's--it's--it's just anoup.
like, Randy, you can--you can call me Noup-dogg.
Anoup-dogg.- Anoup-dogg.
and you study barbecue?
no, I am a, uh, masters student in folklorat unc.
my undergraduate thesis was about, uh, southern myth--myth in southern culture.
and, uh, the way I explored that was through barbecue.
I can send it to you if you want me to.
so you did study barbecue?
Yes. Yes. So the short answer was, yes.
okay.
all right. Now what are you gonna sing?
I'm gonna sing thank you by boyz ii men.- Good.
thank you.
didn't expect that.
no, I didn't expect that.
I didn't expect the soulfulness to come out of you. Anoup.
thank you.- Dawg, you hadome crazy vocals jumpin' off there.
in tune.
had vibe.
personality.
Anoup-dogg is in the house.
What?!
I like kind of what you did with the song. You flipped it up in your own way.
it was pretty good.
it's all a bit geeky at the moment, though.
huh?- It's all a bit geeky.
the look.
that's gonna change.
well, we're just talking about the-- We're talking about the vocals, man.
no, but it looks like you've just come out of a meeting with, uh, bill gates or somebody.
Hey, that might be a good meeting to have, though, dawg.
but you know what I mean. It's all a bit, sort of, silicon, high-tech.
preppy. Yeah, he's preppy.
okay, but good voice.
I'm gonna say yeah, man.
hook up the wardrobe, but yeah.
I'm gonna say yes, but work on the stage presence a little.

you're fine.
voice was really good. I say yes.
thank you very much.- So four yeses.
welcome to hollywood, dawg!
Anoup-dawg goes hollywood.

but we didn't sign up for what was delivered next.
like swimming in jell-o, isn't it?
is this serious?
no no no
it's all a bit nice.
like a little kitten.
coming up, contestants go to the extremes.
Oh, come on. Come on, come on. What the

this is probably the most important event of my life.
I want to show everybody that I can sing.
american idol's what's gonna help us.

this is my dream. Please say yes.
I'm gonna say no.
welcome back to kansas city.
now, you know, on past seasons of idol, we've seen our fair share of gimmicks.
and while most left their gimmick back out in line, andrew lang brought his front and center.
Oh, come on.
come on, come on.
okay!
Andrew, the awesome singer has a very awesome voice and if you ever heard it

Andrew, the American idol
here's andrew!

great opening, right?- Great.
that's a lot--you've got a big lead up now.
right, okay, Andrew, we've established you are here with two fans.
that's true, yes.
though I'm not sure they've done you any favors at all at the moment, but.
God. Party pooper.
well, Andrew, uh, no pressure here.
what are you gonna--what are you gonna sing?
I'm gonna be singing my girl by the temptations.
okay.- There you go.
thank you!
nothing but love.
nothing but love for you.
okay, so, uh...
can I just say no to all three of you?
no.
that wasn't fair.
no, Andrew, it was--Andrew, it was Oka um, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be, - but it wasn't fantastic.- Okay.
uh, didn't help, you know, having these two as your backup singers and dancers either, I don't think.
I really liked their little skit.
I liked their skit.
you have to start at the bottom of the pyramid and make your way to the top.
there's always a way for him to go ahead and get to what you want.
have you been listening to Paula?
no, I'm talking about you.
bring it on, girlfriend.
okay, should we dispose of all this?
I'm gonna say yes to andrew.
I'm gonna give him another shot.
ten seconds, sing something.- Okay.
here's the thing, Andrew.
you are very theatrical.
Yeah, and I just changed my vote with that one.
Yeah.
the cheerleaders are crying for you?
this is--this is wild.
Oh, come on. Come on.
this is very uncomfortable now.
this is bad. We can't, we can't.
I'm saying no, but I appreciate you guys coming out.
we enjoyed it.
you're Justhoney, you're not gonna make it in this competition.
so sorry to tell you that and your friends.
guys, sorry.
nice to meet you.- Thank you, though.
musical theater--you can make lots of money.
musical theater--all of you.
but an a-plus for effort.
and thank you.- A-plus.
you're with Andrew.
it's a no.
to everybody?
Yeah. It's okay, though.
no, what happe--oh, we have tears.
what's wrong?
well, he's not crying, but you are, and he's the one that didn't make
well, we just really wanted him to make it through, and this is, like--this has been, like, a three-year thing.
he really wanted it.
he deserves it.
but he really does deserve it.
like, he works so hard at everything he does, and, like, if they would give him another chance,
I'm sure that--I'm positive that he would--all he could do.
well, the good news is, you have great people around you. You have good friends.
it's fine. We still have good spirits.
Yes, we do.- Thank you. Yes, we do.
we've got spirit, how about you?!
Andrew, out.
so team Andrew gets sidelined, but hoping to get in the game is 28-year-old asa barns.
one, two, ready? And...
what I do for a living is I'm a band director at a middle school.
my students view me as a positive person, someone that really has their best interest at heart.
it is an experience, and you want them to have a good experience with band, and--so they will carry that on into the rest of their life.
good. That's good.
I have a daughter.
her name is Amaya. She's four years of age.
why is Asa the next American idol?
because... because he is.
that's right.
being a father is probably the most important thing to me at this time in my life.
I definitely want to show that it is okay to be a good dad.
I think that if you have a dream, it is--it is a seed that's planted in you early on in life, and I'm just ready to be plucked, so take me.
Asa, come on down, dawg.
come on down.
so your name is Asa Barnes.
Yes, sir.- All right, dawg, so you're a band director, man.
now, being a band director, I'm expecting, like, big doings from you.
actually, I use singing a lot in what I do every day.
all right, so what you gonna sing?- What are you gonna sing?
I'll start with Michael Jackson, the way you make me feel.
you got one choice, Asa.
okay. - Go for it.
okay. Okay. Okay.
Simon, what do you think of Asa, man?
I like you, Asa. I'm gonna be honest with you.
28--I don't really understand why you would do that--that song like that.
um, so I'm slightly puzzled here.
I like it, and it's a great song.
Hey, that's a good answer, dawg.
that was crazy right there-- I like it.
that was the right answer.- That was good.
okay, I don't think--I-- I'm finished.
got it.- Paula Abdul.
you know what?
when people sing Michael, it usually is a disaster.
and this was definitely not a disaster.
thank you.
Kara?-I-I like Asa.
I do.
I think he's got a whole vibe.
it was hot, baby.
thank you, thank you.- Simon, yes or no?
uh, maybe because of your answer, I'm gonna say yes.
Yes!
absolutely, yes.
Yes.
I say yes. Welcome to hollywood, baby!
work it out, work it out.
coming up... Simon softens up.
I think you are absolutely fantastic.
michael Nicewonder is on a mission.
I'm gonna walk in there and become a star.
and can this contestant see into the future?
Simon, I had a dream about you last night.
so it's just after 7: 00.
the judges have put through 25 people so far today to hollywood.
got a lot of good ones today, really good ones.
let's keep that streak alive with Michael Nicewonder.
I'm 20 years old, and I'm from Grand Island, Nebraska, and I'm really excited to be here.
so is this--what's this from, this medal?
this is from, uh, elementary school.
I won it for best vocalizing in music class.
about five years ago, I actually got a fortune cookie back, and I placed it on the back of this, saying, a person with a determined heart frightens problems away.
and what's your heart like today?
pretty confident.
Determined?- Yes.
I am a star that has been undiscovered...
until now.
I wa to show everybody that I know that I can sing.
have they said you can't?
some people, yes.
she doesn't think I can sing, but that's why I'm here...
to prove her wrong.
I am gonna walk in there and become a star.
michael Nicewonder.- Yes.
Nicewonder.- Yes.
hmm, that's nice.
you're related to Hank Williams jr?
Yes, I am.
wow, so music is in the blood.
Yes. -So you must be very good.
what's written all over your shirt?
people from high school-- a lot of my friends signed it.
good luck, whatever. Okay, what are you gonna sing?
don't do that.
that's not nice.
okay, what are you gonna sing?
how about an original song?
Yes. Yeah.
Oh, man.
Michael, was that written about a pet or someone?
I was originally supposed to write it for my mother.
but I have one for my grandmother that I wrote.
can I hear the grandmother one?- Oh, god!
is it a bit more cheerful?
a little bit. - Okay, let's hear that.
the chorus of it is.
okay, off you go.
okay, look, you could've actually sent them the same song.
or combined them.
I'm still working on those songs.
it was like a second verse. -You're still working on it.
Yes. -Okay, they--they were a bit gloom--a bit gloomy.
like, they didn't sound like mother-son songs.
uh... Sounded like girlfriend...
I'm not trying...
to be the best songwriter.
Right.-I think I'm just trying to be me.
Yeah. You should actually go over to hallmark.
and I'm being serious. You could write those, you know, mother's day cards.
you know?
building you a bridge.
that's exactly what he wanted to hear.
all right, yeah.
honey, you're true to your name.
you're a nice guy, but singing and... sorry.
Yeah, Michael, the singing is not--it's not right for
the "n"or the "y"?
no, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna--it's a no, Michael, but thank you.
Thanks, man. Good looking out, dawg.
sweet guy.
I guess the judges didn't think that I had what it takes, and I thought that I had what it takes.
Simon was being his usual and laughed at me...
he said,"that was just awful."
and while Michael's idol dreams are shattered, Dennis Brigham was hoping his would come true.
I had a dream about it last night, and Simon told me, you were the best that we seen today.
you've got something special about you.
I'm hoping that I can get him to say that.
you're picturing--I like the way you're picturing this, in a positive way.
put 25 people through...
to hollywood.
will you be the 26th?
I hope so.
let's do it.
Hey, Dennis.
what it is? What it is?
that's for hollywood. Yeah.
Simon, I had a dream about you last night.
all of you all.
I'm so excited.
you are. -I'm so excited.
I can tell you are, Dennis.
let's hope you can sing well.
what are you gonna sing?
I'm gonna sing with you by Chris Brown.
all right. -All right, cool.
it was all a bit crazy fome.
I'll be honest with you, Dennis.
I didn't get it.
okay, okay, I get it.
thank you, Dennis. Randy?
please yes.
I want this so bad, y'all.
I promise you, I--this is my dream.
please say yes.
I promise you, I can sing very good.
I'm a little nervous right now, but I can sing very, very, very, very good.
very?
very, very--give me five verys.
very, very, very, very, very good.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
no, no, no, you don't have to sing.
don't sing anymore.
all right, you know what? I'm gonna say yes, Dennis.
thank you, Paula.
I'm gonna say no.
Randy, please, come on.
I promise you, I will do a lot better if y'all just let me through to this round.
I worked so hard.
all my family outside.
I really, really want this so bad.
my mama flew in from florida and all that.
we worked really, really hard.
I'm just worried.
tears already.
we haven't even got the results yet and you're crying.
she's been nervous all day.
Randy, yes or no?
Yes!
Yes, thank you so, so much.
Kara, yes or no?
Kara, please yes.
Dennis, you know? He's really funny.
that called being duped.
Dennis, buddy...
Yeah, buddy, we got to do our handshake.
just move on up We got to keep doing it.
Simon, I'm disappointed in you.
you let me down, and you was the most important person that I wanted to see, but I'm gonna try my hardest to change your mind, and you're gonna see me again in hollywood.
coming up...
what makes this dream turn into a nightmare?
you made the wrong choice.
I should've been the next american idol.
and what comes out of this girl's mouth to make Kara say this?
for me, you're the best that's come through here.
it's close to the end of the day in Kansas city, and when the sun set on the horizon, it may have also set on the talent.
I'm scared that you're gonna say no.
it's not right.
Oh, no, no, no, no, adult woman with a child voice.
Kelly, just to be clear, the first records you bought were Paula's, yeah?
and while the evening can mask the disappointment of some...
no. I don't really care.
it's not that big of a deal to me.
it's okay.
I'm not crying.
no tears?
I'm strong!
others now have a reason to celebrate the night.
Margaret's going to hollywood!
we're going to hollywood!
but as the near-empty holding room buzzes with enthusiasm,
all day the excitement of the auditions haven't fazed her one bit.
next!
let's hope she's able to rouse the judges.
are you the next American idol?
Yes, I am.
all right, that is a good answer, and what are you gonna sing for us?
I'm gonna sing loving you by Minnie Ripperton.
okay.
let's hear it.
okay, Mia.
Mia, this isn't going well, sweetheart.
no?
Oh, all right, weot there.
we've arrived.
okay, let's take a vote.
you just wanted to give us that.
no, baby.
Nah, nah.
no?
Mia, Mia, Kia, I want to say yes.
you are a sweetheart, but the voice, mnh-mnh, it's not there.
and you probably chose the toughest song in the world.
Yeah.
but, Mia, it's a no, darling. -Can I sing something else?
no, Mia, it's a no, sweetheart.
this is not for you. -Thank you, love.
look, I know I can sing.
I've been singing since I've been three years old.
I can hit Mariah Carey high-pitch.
and they didn't let me go through.
I mean, that is just ridiculous.
you guys are wrong, and god's gonna make you pay for it.
maybe Mia just needs to cool off for a second.
you judges are wrong.
you're wrong, wrong, wrong.
you're cutting everybody else 'cause you made too many people go, and the last people get thrown out.
that's not right.
God's gonna get you.
you made the wrong choice.
I should've been the next American idol.
God's gonna get you, and I'm still gonna be a star.
so, if Mia's right and the judges are cutting everyone, that doesn't bode well for the last contestant in Kansas city.
my name is Lil Rounds.
I'm from Memphis, Tennessee, and I am 23 years old.
ready to go, baby?
I'm a mom of three--very, very, very busy.
come on, let's put our shoes on.
a lot of people had told me,"I don't know, lil, maybe singing has to wait.
and that's the same thing I thought.
but then a sudden wake-up call changed Lil's perspective.
we had a tornado to actually touch down in Memphis.
um, it came through the back of our apartments, and it tore them up.
uh, we had to end up vacating.
with three children and a husband, you can imagine, that was very hard, and right now we're still trying to recover.
american idol is what's gonna help us.
it's gonna hp me, help them, you know, help my family.
hello.
Hello, hello, hello.
Hello, how are you?
what a great name, Lil Rounds.
Oh, yes. -It's a very cool name.
I love my name.
it's a good one.
very good.
what are you gonna sing for us today?
today I'm gonna do a little bit of Stevie Wonder, all I do.
I like that song.
all right, let's hear it.
I really like you, Lil.
you're good. -Thank you.
you are good.
let's see, um, Paula?
I love you.
I think that you have it going on.
your vocals are really, really good--one of the best that I've heard, and, um, whoever told you to stop dreaming your dream, tell them to go kiss your li-- lil' behind.
thank you.
I think you are absolutely fantastic.
Simon, oh, my god.
thank you so much.
you know what? There's something about-- there's something about you.
you're very retro, you know, really kind of, like, classy.
you know?
and, uh, just a singer's singer.
a mixture of Fantasia and Mary J. Blige.
I like you a lot.
Oh, man!
I thought the vocals were jumping off, man, and I'm-- I'm, uh...
you're really good.
you're really good. ...
happy you showed up for this competition.
for me, you're one of the best that's come through here.
y'all, excuse me.
I'm so happy.
love that she doesn't know she's so great.
Yeah, well, I already said you're--I said you're one of the best.
no more Memphis!
welcome to hollywood!
thank you.
love her.
got a hot one. Got a hot one.
I am so glad to be here right now.
I am so thankful.
I'm so happy.
I love my husband.
I love American Idol.
I am going to hollywood!
so were 25 others who struck gold in K. C.
welcome to hollywood!
this is everything.
everything!
welcome to hollywood, baby!
Yes, thank you.
congratulations, you're going to hollywood!
you've got four yeses.
we're going to hollywood!
Kansas city... rocked.
so I'm now in love with Kansas.
but the search has only just begun.
join us as the auditions continue on the most talent-packed season of American Idol yet.
we'll visit six more cities and find more unforgettable voices.
I think hollywood is going to love you.
I think you're cute. I think you're original.
I really like you.
I thought it was hot.
there's something in the water in Louisville.
God, I feel good!
and in Salt Lake city, Simon gets more bunny than he bargained for.
Oh, my god!
San Juan stirs things up.
and new york brings the attitude.
I would've thought you'd have quite liked that.
you mean the way you like it when seacrest does it?
in Jacksonville, anything can happen.
yo, the girls are making out!
and San Francisco gives us something to talk about.
I will say what I want to say, and I will sait now.
in all, 147 people heard that famous phrase.
welcome to hollywood!
but as you know, a ticket to hollywood means a ticket to hell week.
I am confident this year that we're gonna find somebody great.
brace yourself for the most dramatic hollywood week ever.
this year, our hopefuls will stand on the stage of the kodak theater, where the stakes are high and so is the drama.
y'all suck as judges.
some will falter.
some will fight.
don't give me these excuses. I hate that.
it's not just your dream at stake here!
and others will rise to the occasion.
but to survive hollywood week, they'll have to put their faith in each other.
and pray they can make it past the judges.
I thought it was indulgent nonsense what you just did.
it's our biggest season yet.
we've traveled across the country...
and auditioned over 100, 000.
now 147 of the best singers in the nation take the stage at the legendary Kodak theatre.
this will separate from the real ones to the fake ones right here this week, right here.
in a few short months, one of them will be voted the next American idol.
and this year's talent is truly unbelievable.
you I can believe as a recording artist.
right now, today, she the one to beat right here.
but getting past these next five days will be the toughest challenge of their lives.
this is not a game to me.
this means everything to me.
I'm not arguing with you because that's what you want.
it's a test of courage.
a test of stamina. And strength.
Oh, my god, I cannot believe this .
you only get one shot.
one chance to make yourself stand out.
because, in the end, there can be only one American idol.
I am confident that we're gonna find somebody great.
get ready for Hollywood week.
this is American idol.
Hollywood, Californi home of the Kodak theatre, where past idols have been crowned.
and this year, it's our location for hollywood week.
it's one of the world's most famous stages.
and this week, there will be filled with 147 of America's best singers.
but once again, they'll have to get past these four.
the judges now making their way into the theatre.
they will let the contestants know what they're in store for this week.
I'll tell you one thing. It is going to be a lot of hard work.
okay, so, basically, you've got one of today.
um, this will be the most important day of your life.
100%. - Yeah.
now, all we're looking for is a star.
good luck.
but this year, we've added a twist.
to help these great singers become even better, yesterday they were enlisted in our first-ever idol boot camp.
we set them up with our stylist and glam squad.
brush it on.
no one notices. - I love this zigzag.
I feel like my manhood is being taken from me.
but it was our vocal coaches who gave the most direct advice.
take care of this part first.
everybody should have a plan B.
your confidence has to show, and it's not showing right now.
tell the story.
danger, danger.
to cap it all off, we had a surprise mentor for them, Grammy award-winner and music legend Barry Manilow.
this is a great opportunity for me to pass down some of my experience to young people who are just about to-to need what I know how to do.
so what is the secret of becoming a star?
preparation meets opportunity.
now you've got the opportunity.
so now it's really up to you to prepare.
really think about these songs that you're gonna do, and make them your own.
these judges want you to win, believe it or not.
they want you to be the next American idol.
as I do.
so I'm glad I could be here for you.
good luck, everybody.
we'll see if that preparation pays off on stage today.
because the pressure's on for half the contestants, while the other half take in a day of sightseeing and will have their shot tomorrow.
here's how the day will work.
the contestants will have little time to prep in the wings before they take the stage in groups of eight.
they'll pass the microphone down the line.
now they can sing whatever they like.
they'll perform a cappella.
not only for the judges, but also for their competition.
and then, they're either in or they're out.
like Simon said, we're looking for a star.
in the first line are two Kansas city contestants...
Dennis Brigham and Lil Rounds.
she made a big impression at her first audition.
for me, you're one of the best that's come through here.
y'all excuse me. I'm so happy.
but here in Hollywood, can this early frontrunner impress the judges again?
okay, okay.
Oh, all right.
Lil Rounds has just finished her audition here in Hollywood.
one of the judges' favorites from the road.
let's see how she does.
thank you.
yo, I gotta stand up for that. That was hot you know what, I liked you the moment I saw you.
I thought that you were bold and brave then, and you're still bold and brave.
and that's what makes for a great artist. - Thank you.
so Lil starts the day off with a standing O.
can Dennis Brigham garner the same reaction, even though he split the panel in Kansas city?
that's for Hollywood.
thank you, Dennis.
okay.
you know, the facial expressions were insane, Dennis, when you were singing.
you know, I don't think anyone is gonna take you seriously, Dennis, as a recording artist.
wasn't good.
after each oup performs, the judges will deliberate.
put them in two different lines.
one group is in, and the other is out.
this year, when you're out, you go home right away.
okay, guys, would the following people step forward?
front row, you are through to the next round.
Lil is in, but Dennis is out.
thank you so much. - See you later.
thank you.
Lil and her group can celebrate because they survive another day.
american idol, yeah!
but back on stage, Dennis is not going do without a fight.
real talk. Y'all say that can't nobody take me serious or whatever.
I disagree.
you sending to America?
and, Simon, guess what?
if I had to do it all again
I wouldn't take away the rain yeah - and y'all sending me home. - Yes.
Yeah, no. - Yup.
y'all say that - well, that's y'all's decision.
y'all suck as judges.
Dennis, you've just reinforced my decision a million times.
great. Good
you need to get some wardrobe...
for somebody to be so rich, - your pants are very very cheap... - You need to buy an attitude, Dennis.
with that cheap very lame shirt you got on...
you're gonna go far, Dennis.
Yeah.
wow, we're off to a great start in Hollywood.
america's gonna be mad because y'all cut me
after the break...
for me, you got raw, natural talent.
some familiar faces prove why they're here to stay.
I was really impressed with you.
Plus, bikini girl and Kara face off once more as the drama continues both on...
I'll fight you tooth and nail on this one.
do what you want. - And off the stage.
dude, this sucks, man.
welcome back to American idol, where half of our contestants are trying to make it past the first round.
the other half, or the lucky half...
I'm the next American idol!
have the day off and are enjoying the sights.
this is the closest we've been to the Hollywood sign.
apparently, we can't get any closer without a horse.
but inside the Kodak, the contestants on stage are having less than a leisurely day.
I don't know if it all came together today, man.
I don't know.
you way overcooked that one, Frankie.
you didn't need to do that.
it seems that nerves are getting the best of the contestants.
and the judges need a break.
how's the day been so far today?
abysmal.
rough, rough, rough start, man.
some of 'em are backstage - There were one or two, like Lil.
she's great. - Lil was fantastic when she sang.
really good. - Yeah, there's a few of 'em.
so let's hope it gets a little bit better, yeah?
Yeah, we're hoping. - Okay.
backstage, the pressure is on for the next group.
it's filled with judge favorites from around the country.
as the line takes the stage, New York contestant Nathaniel Marshall was the first to sing.
today, I'm gonna sing a song called the Anchor Holds, and it's by Ray Boltz.
not very familiar, but I hope you guys like the melody.
fine.
you have beautiful vocals, - but you picked a song today... - About a ship.
that stayed here the whole time.
you're so talented. - Thank you.
you really are. Just the song choices.
what -what was the inspiration behind that song?
well, I'm one of those kids that's been through a lot, and it means something to me because music's always been the anchor that keeps me from freaking out when something bad happens or when, you know, I didn have people around me to support me like other people.
you're a real talented guy.
and I just want this more than anything.
it's on...
my skin.
like, it just bursts out of me every time I'm on stage, and I don't know why.
it's okay, sweetheart.
it's all right, dawg. - Yeah.
it's all good. - Yeah.
thank you so much. - Thank you.
thank you.
now Nathaniel must wait for the rest of his line to perform before he finds out the results.
next was judge and fan favorite Anoop Desai from Kansas city.
and Jasmine Murray from the Jacksonville auditions.
okay, for me, you got raw, natural talent.
thank you. - Thank you.
last in line is Rose.
hello. - Hi, guys.
it's me, Rose, um, Flack.
arriving in Hollywood, Rose was ready for the week ahead of her.
I'm doing pretty good. How are you?
I'm pretty excited.
but yesterday during boot camp, rehearsals didn't go well.
I started way too high. Can I start over?
uh, I have to ask you...
what does it mean for you to be here at American idol?
a lot. - What does it mean to you?
I'm doing it -doing it for my parents, so...
yeah?
rose is struggling to find her own voice in the midst of so many talented sgers.
and after rehearsals, she breaks down.
I got here and realized that
I don't really have all that great a voice, and it's just kind of affecting me, and I just...
don't want to let my mom or my dad down and...
I felt like I kinda did here.
she left with her confidence shattered.
and now she's about to take the stage for the most important performance of her life.
thank you. - Cute.
it's now decision time for Rose and the rest of the line.
guys, in this particular one, you're all, unfortunately, in the same boat.
so you can all stay where you are...
because you're all through to the next round.
an uproar of emotion as the entire group goes through.
but will others be so lucky?
after the break, amazing performances...
you nailed it.
you slayed it, dude.
and Norn gentle.
they're all jealous of me.
Plus, which judge favorite gets this line from Simon?
I thought it was indulgent nonsense.
welcome back to Hollywood week.
backstage at the Kodak, Von Smith is preparing for his performance.
you can't get by with any mistakes at all.
so you just gotta step up your game, you know?
von share this line with Jorge Nunez and Steven Fowler.
I might look relaxed and chill right now, but on the inside it's a volcano of emotions.
as the guys take the stage, they know today's performance is absolutely critical.
first up was Steven Fowler.
you -you nailed it.
thank you. Thank you.
for most people that don't know, that's Stevie's song.
it's a hard song. - That's like -it's one of the hardest ever.
I was like,"dawg, you gonna take that big, old bear on"?
boy, you slayed it, dude.
what? - Thank you. Thank you.
that was great, man. - Thank you.
now it's Jorge's turn.
thank you very much.
that was beautiful.
thank you so much.
that was absolutely beautiful.
and next up was Von.
thank you.
I thought it was indulgent nonsense what you just did, Von.
uh, horrible song.
a horrible performance.
really annoying.
um, it's the sort of thing a child would do, you know?
seriously, when they're learning to sing at, like, ten and...
horrible.
thank you.
it's some tough criticism for Von.
and now all he can do is wait for the judges' decision.
okay, guys.
Steven, can you step back?
George, step back.
and, von, take a step back.
how does the back row feel about staying in Hollywood?
front row, thank you so much.
all three guys have made it through, but Von is taking this victory with a grain of salt.
not very happy.
the fact that they gave me another chance, you know, is very humbling, and I'm gonna have to work really hard because I really want this, so...
it's just before noon, and after Simon's nasty comments, nerves are hitting an all-time high.
and out on stage, it's not the contestants' voices that are causing the problem.
you guys are picking songs that are not serving you well at all.
so much the wrong choice of song for you.
yesterday, in boot camp, vocal coach Debra Byrd spent hours emphasizing the importance of picking the right song.
song choice. Song choice.
know why you've chosen a song.
is this the right song for me, right here, right now?
if that's how you see yourself as a recording artist, that should be your choice.
if it's not, don't sing it.
but now it seems her advice has gone unheeded.
and some bad decisions are turning into plane tickets home.
it's a no, baby. It's a no for me.
I mean, of all the millions of songs you could have chosen, you chose that.
I'm not gonna give up.
I'm gonna go home and work on singing again, and as soon as next year hits,
I'm gonna do it again.
if you really listened to us, you would never have picked that song.
I picked the wrong damn song.
you have.
I fell apart.
didn't pick a right song.
and it didn't work out, so...
I screwed myself over.
right now I'm just a little pissed off.
however, song choice is not the hardest decision that Nick Mitchell had to make.
don't remember Nick?
how about Norman?
Nick used the character named norman gentle to make it through the New York auditions.
american idol. - Hello.
Norman, I am going to say a categorical no.
I'm not gonna beg, though.
please!
Randy, please say yes.
okay, yes.
whatever.
whatever. Yes.
I don't want you to be funny.
I just want you to be serious.
you know what, Colleen, no more Normans -no more Norman.
Yes. - I'm done with this.
so nick has decided to say good-bye to Norman gentle.
time to be Nick.
and I give you, for the first time, Nick Mitchell.
all right, time for some honesty.
Oh, boy.
or maybe not.
I'm here to have some fun.
I am Norman gentle.
I am 27 years old.
I am from Stratton, Vermont.
and I'm gonna rock.
nice pitch pipe.
thank you.
yo, man.
all right, so, listen, this is the funny thing about you, man.
you are hilarious, dude. - He is so funny.
you are like a ba-noodles kind of a guy, but you know what's funny?
dude, you actually can sing. - Oh, thanks.
you got some skills in there, dawg.
thank you, dawg.
uh, Nick, Norman, whatever your name is,
I genuinely don't know what to make of you because, without the glasses and the silly headband, you're just a boring person.
and then, when you put the -the stupid outfit on, you become a joke.
which it is.
I mean, it's just ridiculous.
it would be really interesting to hear you sing a song all stripped down.
I don't mean you strip.
no, no, no. No, no, it's okay.
Nick, Norman, Nick, Norman.
but without the affect, without the gimmick, you got talent.
you got skills. So we'll see.
thank you.
now it's judgment time for nick.
okay, Nick, norman...
you're gonna have to do this all over again.
so, somehow, Nick or Norman is headed for the next round.
and weren't we -are we gonna retire this look?
for the show. I don't want to be a "clown," as Simon says.
no, that's right.
all right, well, congratulations, buddy.
thank you so much. - Have some fun.
along with nick, Arizona native Scott Macintyre and new mom Frankie Jordan have also made it through to the next round.
we made it!
I have to go now.
Bye.
coming up...
tomorrow is another day as the second half takes the stage.
one of the best I heard today, dude. Very, very nice.
I love you.
you are fantastic.
but the pressure gets to the contestants...
dude, this sucks, man.
and the judges.
I'll fight you tooth and nail on this one.
do what you want.
Plus, bikini girl is in the theatre.
yesterday was a tough day in Hollywood.
I want this more than anything.
half the contestants performed in front of our judges at the Kodak.
and many were sent packing.
I thought it was verging on desperate.
I need more than that.
that song did not serve you well at all.
it was way overdone.
y'all suck as judges.
it's a no, baby. It's a no for me.
today the other half take the stage as round one continues.
can we get some music in here?
please say a command.
play track shut up and drive.
83 contestants arrived at the Kodak ready to sing for survival.
thousands in line all across America.
hours of waiting, months of preparation.
let's see how they do today.
the contestants are now getting in the zone for what could be their last audition.
but Jackie Tohn seems unable to settle down.
we first met Jackie in New York, where she literally brought down the house.
Oh, no.
when the camera's on me too long, I start doing stupid stuff.
my name is Jackie Tohn.
I am 28 years young.
what's more important, song choice or outfit choice?
Ooh, it's a tough call.
whether I'm coming or going, I'm a tiger.
you guys cut this a certain way, boy, would I look terrible.
thank you, Jackie.
thank you, Simon.
uh, Jackie, you know, I like you, man.
you definitely kind of wild.
you know, I felt like we weren't even here.
you just were in your room.
you were just gonna go on all night.
but I like you, though.
I like you.
Yeah.
I remember you the most out of all the auditions.
I like you, Jackie, and I think we would...
miss you if you weren't here.
thank you so much, you guys.
good. - I really appreciate it.
Bye-bye.
not bye-bye. Hello.
first group of the day out. Results in.
judges about to deliver them.
let's see if they set the tone for the rest of day two in Hollywood week.
Jackie, step forward.
front row, see you tomorrow. You made it through. Back row, thank you.
while Jackie is through, her mood is somber.
it's a little tough to celebrate in the company of friends of ours who are going home.
part of the emotional journey of being in Hollywood is making lasting friendships.
nice to meet you.
thank you so much.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too.
we met each other in Kansas city.
Jenesis. - Good to see you.
nice to see you again.
we are friends.
best friends.
what's your name again?
best friends for life. Up high.
and while it seems too soon to say good-bye, some friendships will have to be short-lived.
that was just the wrong song.
I don't think you got it.
I mean this.
you've been the sweetest person I met since I've been here.
Bye.
and while the book must close for some of the contestants, best friends Danny and Jamar are starting a new chapter.
we first met the pair in Kansas city.
welcome to Hollywood, dawg.
where Danny told us about the recent loss of his wife.
I hate talking about this 'cause it's...
when Sofie passed, it was...
it was really unexpected.
he puts on such a brave face for people.
I admire him so much.
I do my best to make him feel better.
I'm very happy that he's here with me.
it takes a lot of the stress off from the situation, having someone that you're comfortable with.
Jamar was first to sing.
thank you.
I'm a big fan of yours, an.
I think that you're different.
I think that you're very relevant.
I'm a fan.
thank you, thank you.
Paula, Simon, Randy, and Kara, my name is Danny Gokey.
I'm gonna sing kiss from a rose by Seal.
cool.
thank you.
so good. He's so good.
I love you.
you are fantastic.
you are ready to record records.
I can't say enough, so I'm just gonna shut up.
Thanks, Danny.
okay, here we go.
front row, congratulations, you're on to the next round.
back row, thank you very much.
Danny and Jamar are through, and day two contestants continue to impress.
you, right now to me, could be one of them stars, dude.
I like you.
you have a gift.
you have an instrument.
you're what we need in this competition.
you're a hell of a singer.
thank you.
you're staying in Hollywood.
but will the streak be short-lived?
coming up...
I did everything they asked me to do.
as the competition gets tougher...
dude, this sucks, man.
people start getting emotional.
and emily buckles under the pressure.
I was very disappointed in that.
you know, I expected more from you.
Plus, bikini girl gets ready for another standoff with our judges.
I put stars on the boobs.
welcome back to American idol.
katrina -don't know if you rem-- just pan up and down, and then you'll remember.
and...oh, yes.
that Katrina.
it's the infamous bikini girl from phoenix who made quite an impression on our judges.
hold on a minute.
when Kara started singing, I thought that was kind of rude.
you do not have to prove it.
no, I wanna show her.
the first thing that went through my heas was...
wow, she is getting insecure.
Simon said I sang it better.
so I'm gonna take what he has to say over her.
welcome to Hollywood.
Yeah. -Yay!
do you think that the other girls appreciate the fact that you'll work it, if you will?
you're the woman who wore the bikini?
Yeah. - Oh, dang.
Oh, here is the bathing suit.
how cute, huh?
I-I-I can't -I can't.
Hi, my name is Katrina Darrell, and I'm 21 years old.
and I'm from Chino Hills, California.
and I'm the next American idol because I am.
great. Good answer.
okay.
good answer, Katrina.
and I'm singing Faith Hill, breathe.
perfect.
thank you, Katrina.
we had such a fun time last time, didn't we?
Oh, come on.
what can I say, you're a beautiful girl.
thank you. - And, actually, I have to tell you, I thought, when you started the song, you were better than the last audition.
you had me there for a moment, thinking maybe... - Yay!
maybe I was wrong, but actually I think I was right.
it went -it went kind of off at the end, and it got really thin and, all joking aside
what's that? - Nothing.
he's going "claw, claw, claw..."
daggers. - "Claw." Claw.
Paula, please. Help a girl out.
you know what...
I do agree at the beginning it started sounding, like, a really nice tone to your voice.
I love to have the music around me.
absolutely right. - Yes, you're right.
you're right, you're right.
you know, your chest just gets so big when that girl's on stage.
that's what makes me want to sing in the first place.
Katrina, I don't think you've had particularly fair criticism from these girls.
thank you. - Yes.
I think there is obviously a problem here.
I absolutely agree with you.
I think with music thawould have been a lot better.
God.
and, um, I think it was better than your first audition.
thank you.
Yeah. Randy?
actually, I have to agree with Simon.
it worked -Listen.
listen, listen, no, but listen. For real.
I love you guys. - No, but for real, though, for real, though.
you've had lessons. This is good. - You have.
Yeah. - Yeah.
but with just her voice stripped down, does she have enough to get through?
God, tough. A lot of deliberating.
it's been a tough day.
but all of you guys will see us tomorrow.
you're through!
leave your number in the back room.
I told you she doesn't like me.
bring your pole tomorrow.
Yeah.
so Katrina survives another round.
but by 3: 00 p. m. some other early standouts weren't as lucky.
like Caretaker Jessica Furney, who we met in Kansas city...
better luck next year.
Sharon Wilbur, who brought her best friend to her Jacksonville auditions...
I really felt like I did my best.
and Patricia Roman, who charmed us with her family in San Juan.
she did good.
to get this far, I'm very, very proud of her.
Patricia leaves with her family in tow.
but Jesus Valenzula from San Francisco and roughneck Michael Sarver had to leave them behind.
for them, coming to Hollywood is a big change.
you're standing in the wings of the Kodak theatre.
give me your thoughts about being here in this moment.
being in the Kodak theatre's amazing.
the first time we walked out there was crazy.
your mind Kinda just gives you an idea of what it's gonna be like, and then you get here, and it's way grander than what you expected.
but away from the oil fields, how will he deal with the pressure of this moment?
um, Michael. Dude.
one of the best I heard today, dude.
very, very nice.
even better than when we first saw you, for me.
nice.
thank you very much. - Good job.
that's gonna be a tough act to follow for Jesus.
thank you.
now it's judgment time for the two fathers.
okay.
Jesus, step forward.
Jeremy, step back.
back row, congratulations.
you're through to the next round.
so Jeremy's through.
but the dream ends for Jesus.
and he's not taking it well.
I need to catch the first flight outta here and get to Sacramento and get back to work.
I'm done with all this.
I just want to go home.
when we return...
what's got Paula and Simon so fired up?
I'll fight you tooth and nail on this one. - Do what you want.
the last contestants take the stage for the final performances and the final decisions.
Oh, my god, I cannot believe this.
welcome back to Hollywood, where the last line of the day has taken the stage.
first up is David Osmond from salt lake city...
Erika Wesley from our Puerto Rico auditions is next.
okay, Erika, thank you very much. - Thank you.
then it was local punk rocker Emily Wynne -Hughes from our Phoenix auditions.
very good.
probably top five, honest to gosh.
I'm feeling good.
I feel, at this point, there's no -there's nothing left to be nervous about.
I think I've got my song chosen.
I decided on singing the 1940s original song I put a spell on you.
I've practiced it as much as humanly possible.
good job on that song.
Yeah, really great.
however, on stage, Emily decides to sing a song that she hasn't rehearsed.
I'm gonna be singing Excuse Me Mr. by No Doubt.
you know what, you were one of the ones that I really remembered very clearly.
and the song was very disappointing.
it didn't show me really what you're all about and where you can go.
Emily, you know we fell in love with you when we first saw you.
that was not the right song for you.
I agree, Emily. I was very disappointed in that.
you know, I expected more from you.
thank you very much. - Thank you.
but now will Emily's sudden song change send her home?
please step forward.
and David, step forward.
please step forward.
front row is through to the next round. Congratulations.
Emily has survived for another day.
Hey, oh, my gosh.
I coulda killed you.
why did you change your song at the last minute?
I got nervous...
so seven people out of Emily's group of eight have something to celebrate.
but Erika wasn't quite ready to accept the result.
I've spent my whole life being a fighter. - Oh, boy.
I really don't want to be the one person out of that line that gets sent home.
I don't want to not try.
I would really, really appreciate it if you guys would give me another chance.
I feel like I can do this.
I was a fan, but I was beaten out by the rest.
what can I do to convince you?
all right, just to be clear, you've written "no."
but here's what I want you to know.
I started with yes.
the reason I went to no is because that was the final decision, - Right, so then don't say you were beaten out of it. - Simon.
I'll fight you tooth and nail on this one.
do what you want.
you gave me a yes in San Juan.
Yeah, I did. No, that's how you got through.
I can do this. - Listen, sweetheart.
Yes, you can, and I'm sure you will.
this is only one audition.
here's the thing.
no, it's my husband's birthday.
I don't care if it's your - Okay, listen, this is not up for discussion.
Oh, come on, come on!
you know, I stand by the decision I made.
I know you don't like it.
I would have regretted not coming back here.
okay, it's a no, but thank you. I understand.
well, thank you, and thank you for hearing me out.
I appreciate it. - Thank you, sweetheart.
okay.
well, then don't say we beat it out of you when you didn't write "yes."
I was the only one who gave her a good compliment.
Erika leaves frustrated, unable to convince the judges.
well, you know what?
just 'cause you can't read my writing, it ain't my problem.
I can read "maybe."
but the judges were already sold on the talent of stay-at-home mom Alexis Grace Mileton, 28-year-old musician Brent Keith Smith, wedding singer Anne Marie Boskovich, and San Francisco standout Adam Lambert.
I think you could be one of them stars.
you're a hell of a singer.
thank you!
in all... - Front row.
the dream is still alive for 104 contestants.
you're staying in Hollywood.
go, idol!
we made it through round one!
whoop, thank you, lord.
Yeah!
see ya.
but they have little time to celebrate because tomorrow...
that was an absolute...
total mess.
is the infamous group day.
I mean, it was relentless.
all of you.
tomorrow night, we're back in the Kodak theatre to witness the triumphs...
and the tragedies of group round.
they have my dream in their hands.
we've seen drama before, but never like this.
I don't care if you cry. I don't care.
some amazing performances.
Yes, yes, yes!
and unbelievable breakdowns.
I cannot believe this.
join us for Hollywood week group round.
forget the words, you're out.
glamorous, stylish Rome.
are you okay?
the stress of the competition had Fatima at an all-time low.
side lined by the flu.
in their challenge,
the girls walked for renowned designer guy matt olo in a bid to embody the italian style.
the winner is
once again Anya came out as challenge winner.
Fatima rallied and pulled off a sexy cover girl commercial.
really nice.
but Lauren could not break out of her punk rock style.
Bye.
and she was the first girl sent back to the US of a
ready, go!
next, the girls waged a fierce battle for posing prowess.
good job.
this is stung.
somewhere at the some of the game at the photo shoot.
give you a top five and a low gave????
girl, that was so good.
like a dance.
but Whitney and Katarzyna didn't quite measure up.
take the hooch away.
we're not talking like an Egyptian.
no more Egyptian and she was sent home.
Bye.
now, only four girls remain,
Whitney, Doll, Engentleman and Fatima.
who will be eliminated tonight?
I can't believe we're in the final four.
I've been in the bottom two the past three weeks.
being on the bottom two twice in a row is really bad.
and so far in this competition,
every girl that that's happened to has gone home the second time.
but the judges have faith in you, Whitney.
I was completely shocked that the judges called my name and I could have been cutlass week.
that's nerve wracking,
you don't like being in that situation,
I definitely don't want to be there again.
I'm not surprised????
but I'm surprised in the final two,
her and I, she went home and I didn't.
now, I definitely have to prove to the judges that I do want to be here.
for the past couple of weeks I've been really nervous.
I have to just not be posey,
just be natural.
even making it this far though,
it still gets the word out,
america and "America's next top model"
are ready for a plus sized model to win the competition.
we don't know who's going to go home.
it had feel good.
you had to be the best out of the entire butch.
You?????
in panel, out of panel in the challenge.
I can't believe it.
the four of us right here.
I would never think.
I'm not really worried about these girls,
I know I just have to focus on myself and do the best job that I can do and really bring it onset.
as you know, the challenge
it's Saleisha.
she's the winner.
she's so pretty.
Oh, My god, it's Saleisha,
all of her pictures are everywhere.
and pose with Tyra.
when we got home we see Saleisha all over the house and I remember when I first saw her,
I was like this girl is gonna win.
I guess I'm the Saleisha of this competition.
all right.
I've got a headache, y'all.
I am so surprised that Dominique made it this far.
she does not look like a model.
Yeah, at all.
it's still her face and I still,
I don't see it.
she's so overboard.
I was hoping she would be on the chopping block today.
I don't know if I can handle her anymore.
she eats worse than I do.
she eats candy constantly.
all the time and always taking other people's food.
she always takes my food.
get your own damn food.
I literally wake up in the middle of the night and hear dominique eating.
two o'clock in the morning she's like stuffing her face with mm's out of her bag.
candy corns,
I want a snicker bar so bad though.
I really don't care whether the girls accept me or like me because I'm not here for them.
I'm here to be "America's next top model"
and I know this is a competition and the chances are,
they're not going to lake like me.
I definitely would consider myself the most improved.
she's a girl teas improving week to week.
girl, that was so good????
she has consistently gotten better and better.
I think panel is seeing it,
so let's just see.
I don't know what to expect anymore,
it's weird.
I'll be upset if I don't win any challenges.
I really came here with a mission and that mission is to win and I'm not gonna give up until I win.
we have two more challenges.
I have to win.
two more.
the competition I'm really really, really, confident.
congratulations
my gosh,
thank you so much.
thank you so much!
I was really impressed with myself.
to have won that many challenges.
I can do this.
I need to have that confident that you are going to win and be "america's next top model."
at least one challenge I must win.
I don't know.
Tyra mail! Tyra mail.
waiting for dominique.
Yeah.
take a picture you might last longer.
love Tyra.
okay.
all right. I've got a headache, y'all.
so we arrive at the park,
lord knows what the hell is it going on.
Oh, Pall.
we see Pall,
and this photographer taking pictures of Pall.
she is so natural,
she has this energy about her,
you just don't want to take your eyes off her.
I'm here with Fran Chest could he and he is a photographer who has shot magazines elle. Marie' claire and cosmo and he's going to do something special for you today.
Hello, ladies, a pleasure to be here today.
??? And the photography- ???
fran Chest could he is going to teach you,
frankly to know what things look look behind the camera is really useful when you're in front of the camera.
okay. Girls. Let's start it.
let's get the camera.
I thought we'd go,
hold the camera like this, ??? And the button and you stay here.
as a model.
it's very important to know what the photographer is thinking.
and you have to see what the other girls with the other girls is so much fun.
I feel awkward.
I actually had a lot of fun shooting the other girls because I got to see what their strengths and weaknesses.
it's nice to know it's hard to find a good picture of my competition.
??? That's beautiful.
dominique is like make it real,
what are you doing,
basically trying to put me down and that's not how you talk to your model.
it's a competition,
but there's a fine line between being competitiven rice respectful though.
always watch where you put your feet.
I held the camera up.
that's great, girls.
all right?
thank you.-That's beautiful.
great sqob, you guys!
you all know how to work the camera now,
all brilliant photographers to be.
well, now I'm going to introduce you to somebody you already know the editor and chief of seventeen magazine.
Hi, girls.
hello. -Hey.
now that you guys had a chance to practice,
your going to get to shoot with a real model.
each of you will get five minutes to do this challenge.
and we'll be evaluating your photos on two things,
how well you work with your model,
and how great your photo turns out.
and the winner of this challenge will get 50 extra frames in the next photo shoot and you guys know how important that is at that stage in the competition,
there's only four of you.
competition is getting so fierce,
this is my chance to prove
I'm serious about this competition to hold my place here and make it very well-known i'm not going to give up without a fight.
the winner of this challenge will get 50 extra frames in the next photo shoot and you nice know how important that is at this stage. Competition,
there's only four of you.
when she said you get 50 extra frames,
I want to have these because I want to rock the next photo shoot.
now that you've had a chance to practice you're going to get a chance to shoot with a real model.
you've got five minutes to make me look beautiful.
let's get started.
Fatima, you're first.
Oh, wonderful.
I know how serious these next photo shoots are going to be,
I really have to step my game up.
look that way,
perfect.
beautiful, hold it.
see if you can have that leg more towards me.
I want to have you in the sun.
I thought Fatima was actually good because she was able to direct Pall,
but not in a disrespectful way,
it was real professional.
can you stand for me in now,
face that one,
Yeah.
one minute left, ladies.
play with your hair.
Fatima as a photographer was very strong.
she was leading me.
securely by the hand and I felt like taking the trip with her.
you can actually smile.
can I. -Yeah.
time's up.
Dominique, you're up.
do you have anything in mind.
even if you kind of had one like leg up.
this leg up or this leg up.
that leg,
I'm sorry,
have fun you know,
whatever, whatever you feel like you want to flow and do I want you just to do that.
it's not terribly specific because I don't know if you want you know,
like, sportyish or
you're walking and kind of not walking all the way,
but and you're looking back like.
I think Dominique was the weakest,
she doesn't have a vision in her mind like what she wants.
it felt like Dominique wasn't sure of herself.
wasn't in control of the situation.
one minute warning.
okay, let's run, run, run, one minute.
we can do this. Pall, you're beautiful,
gorgeous Pall.
hot, hot.
do it again.
30 seconds.
I felt that she was uncertain.
she really wanted to accomplish something brilliant and something great,
but she didn't quite know how.
time is up.
you can be a body shot.
okay.
Yeah, you have the big tree and the foliage and surroundings like for you to be strong.
I'm a beautiful tree.
pall is not only a supermodel she's also our judge so taking pictures of her is incredibly intimidating.
your eyes look at me.
there you go. That's great.
flip your hair.
that looks amazing,
your jaw line looks incredible and maybe bring that leg in.
I think I communicated pretty well with Pall and I try to describe to her what I was doing and I was in a different position,
tried to be as verbal as possible????
that looks incredible, animallistic.
Whitney comes across as professional ???? and she directed Pall here and knows this is going to be the perfect lighting and everything.
you've got one minute left.
let me get more close stuff too.
I love that smile, the light,
smiling there.
30 second warning.
Whitney was a lot of fun to shoot with as a photographer.
you look kind of sassy,
you look uh-huh.
she didn't hesitate.
time is up.
time is up?
that was good.
lose the model.
Oh, are you ready?
Yes, I'm ready.
if Pall looks bad it's my fault as a photographer.
I have a vision.
okay.
I want you it grab these leaves and throw it in the air and have a big smile???
just jump.
high energy and a big smile on your face. -All right.
that was great.
Yes,
and play with these things,
like you're curious,
what is this?
and like, tug on it, Yeah.
and you've got one minute left.
Oh, My gosh, it goes by so fast.
Anya is all over the place,
she doesn't know how to channel her energy,
like this ball of radiation.
Oh, sorry, wrong way,
that's really nice Pall.
okay and then have a huge smile and even jump around,
lots of energy.
Anya needs to narrow her focus a little bit she's excited and great energy,
but if she narrowed her vision a little bit more,
probably get a better result.
I love it Pall,
give me energy.
you're a tiger.
I love it.
time is up.
thank you, Pall.
Hi, ladies. -Hi.
pall and I have reviewed your film.
and we have a few critiques to give you about your photos that you took today.
lets start with Whitney.
let's.
so, from your film,
your beauty shots really hit your stride.
the light was on her face,
she looked beautiful.
those were really great photos.
I actually really liked taking pictures with you,
because you had sort of a firm hand and you didn't hesitate and told me exactly what you wanted when you wanted it like boom, boom, boom,
when somebody talks to you like that,
you feel like they know what they're talking about.
thank you.
all right. Anya.
so, you had this crazy idea that wasn't totally realized.
you were probably the one that was the most fun to shoot with,
when your stuff worked,
it worked really well or doesn't work at all.
Fatima what I thought was great,
you tried a bunch of different things if I was editing that film I would feel thankful you'd given me so many options.
you were the one I was the most relaxed with and you also knew what you wanted me to do,
but in a sort of gentle manner,
nice, a nice experience.
your competition,
just wasn't quite there.
what I was seeing was a lot of cactus hats.
you had a vision and you wanted to take me there and I was inspired to go wherever you were going to lead me,
but you led me to a cactus.
the winner of today's challenge
Oh, my god!
that's my first challenge.
Bravo, your first challenge.
I feel like I deserved it and finally I won a challenge, yea!
buy, guys.
see you later.
that looks good.
now that I'm doing better
I'm like actually doing my runway practices a lot more.
I came here with a mission and that mission is to win.
work it.
walk like - work it out.
she does all this.
and she doesn't know how to hold it for the sake of her.
I know I can bring it.
not sure,
you know, that's when the end she goes.
hold it, hold it together.
feel a little confident for like a second at the end.
so Dominique would think I don't know what I'm doing is kind of comical to me,
it's funny to me because I don't think she knows what she's doing.
I don't really get her,
she's annoying.
I've always believed that I would make it all the way.
I made it all the way and sometimes better pictures than I did at certain,
you know, certain photo shoots and I'm still here.
I believe in myself I think more than any of these other girls do.
that's what's going to get me to the runway despite any of these chicks that think they have advantage over me,
they don't.
it's amazing when you believe in yourself it sends out this powerful energy almost like reaffirming what you already know and it's even more powerful.
you're like you're super woman now.
listening to Dominique this long,
it's so frustrating,
she drains my energy and I feel myself melting,
I'm melting,
Oh, I can't take it anymore!
that means so much more when you believe in yourself.
if you've got all the talent in your world,
but your a like,
I'm unsure,
I don't know,
can I be "America's next top model,"
Yeah.
dominique wants this so bad,
but so do we,
so do I, so does Anya,
so does Whitney.
this competition is getting intense.
they're out for blood,
but they will give you a taste of fame.
love Tyra.
I think we are going to be posing with a whole bunch of guys.
I'm going to get my wrist,
honestly bus every photo shoot you have to go in there thinking you're going to be number one.
I've been around you the past this week,
if anyone has president Bush to be the best this week, it's me.
I've worked hard to be part of the final fall.
there's no room to stop.
there is a he no room for error???
it's over whel being, ????
will she dp home,
I don't know if whitney's going home this week,
but now what this is a competition and I'd remember her go home than me.
Ciao, ladies.
we're actually going to do a night shoot.
each and every one of you are going to be styled like movie stars from the 50's with a sexy male model on your arm.
being stalked by the paparazzi.
which in Ltalian means mosquito.
who else could I get to shoot today's photo shoot than a photographer who knows just a little bit about what it's like to be in the public eye.
no introduction necessary.
Mr. Nigel Barker.
Hey, ladies.
I heard that Fatima,
you won the challenge this week,
which means you get an extra 50 frames at your photo shoot today.
so let's go on upstairs to the warmth and hair and makeup. Come on we're here for a reason.
even though it gets kind of suffocating at times it's like,
Oh, you want to pull out your hair and people get these and you got to let it go.
this should feel a little cinematic,
don't think of just standing there and posing,
we're kind of going to the next level,
you're going to have the paparazzi in your face, like, no!
try and make it,
the best it can be,
when you're out there.
like I never had a boyfriend,
so, like, I can't be be sexy around guys.
it's the first time,
see another man besides me.
let's go, Enanya.
you will kiss him?
yeah?
Hello, Nigel.
aren't we looking incredible.
I shot with Nigel before so I'm it comfortable,
you have to give good energy and inspire the photographer.
so movie star, glamour, paparazzi,
I need continuous flow,
it's very movie like.
paparazzi in the shot, please
for me, it seems like you're modeling make it effortless.
really, is that how women get caught by the paparazzi???
there you go.
Nigel keep shooting.
you can stumble, fall, giggle,
when I distract you,
it felt like a real paparazzi shot.
my distraction shot is the best one.
don't forget the light.
Oh, that was your last frame.
you have a critique for me.
not a critique, ??? When I got into this we were distracting you,
we got you out of your own head.
it dopt necessarily make you a great model doing what we're doing,
but I think you've got potential to get there.
Anya first of all looked at part stunning,
but the training wheels are still on,
I had to distract her to get the photograph,
what is Anya going to do when she's left alone?
Fatima. You look glamorous.
I have so much advantage over the other girls because 50 extra frames for one of our last photo shoots,
I mean, that's perfect.
this is is the paparazzi,
you've kind of been caught,
I'm going to be you for a second you're going to stand there and watch me,
from this perspective.
there's paparazzi and action going on like this here and flip it around,
but give knee some kind of moment,
if you want to be sultry,
got it, thank you.
Hey, Fatima, Fatima,
remember this,
this is a snapshot out of a film,
I want to believe it, okay?
this is your moment.
all right.
Fatima, don't forget where the camera is, honey,
this is not a memorable shot if I don't see the star's face.
Hey, Fatima,
I just want to remind you you do get 50 extra frames,
Yeah, we might need these.
I don't feel the moment and you're just giving me pretty girl on an arm.
imagine if you could never recap tour the opportunity to to be in this competition.
last frame.
all right, Fatima,
get your ass up here, please.
I got to stop in between my photo shoot and look at what was going on.
I'm looking at them,
like, oh my god,
they are kind of bad.
you look more disgusted with peed dro than with the paparazzo nothing was good enough.
this was a disaster.
I just wanted to get things right.
all right, almost like a whole new chance.
look, I'm bored stiff.
try something for me, Fatima.
gets in a fight,
be kaning gri.
anger.
you're on the final two, honey,
Tyra's sending your ass home, honey.
there you go.
make this important now,
come on guys.
that was it. That's it.
I've got to say it's unbelievable because you're such a beautiful girl that honey,
that kind of stuff isn't inspiring.
Fatima was interesting for me she came to sense and looked beautiful,
there was no star power,
she wasn't taking control
I'm glad I'm shooting with Nigel， he is a judge,
that's nerve rack, ????
I want him to see I can work and take direction.
Hey, guys???
a little posey for me.
what you've done is posey,
but if you play with him a little more,
quote, unquote, it might feel a little more real.
??? Pretend this was a motion picture.
there you go.
Ooh, your booty looks cute.
last frame.
you look great,
it's all about whether you got pretty or not,
it's about how you work within this idea.
you I think this shoot was really difficult.
I tried so many different emotions and angles with my boyfriend and playing with him and having fun,
Yoping it was my best shoot,
but I looked pretty.
you may be the bitchy diva and giggly diva, sexy diva and ultimately you have to believe it yourself and then we'll believe it.
I love nigel waiting to shoot with him for a long time and I'm thinking big and I feel like I can turn it up more than the other girls,
do this.
it feels staged for a camera as opposed to being surprised by a camera,
let go of the poses and you need to move like it's a
is that your star with your hands off to the side.
make it yourself.
you look fantastic.
five shots left Dominique.
last frame.
got it.
I don't know what's going on with all the you all today and you need to have a sigh ans or something and bring the spirits back in,
this just did not come to set to me today for anybody.
in my opinion Dominique did not do a good job,
actually she took a few steps back.
Hey, Nigel,
that's a wrap. -That's a wrap.
I'm really bummed out I thought I did like okay,
but like in the beginning he said I was too posey ??? and able to distract me then I did good.
I just want this so bad to be in the final three.
I mean, to come this far, to almost like,
like feel it and grab it and just want to hold it
I'm scared for panel.
half of us are going to be left tomorrow.
I'm always nervous about panel and I needed to have the best picture this week.
pull something out of nothing.
it's like the best of the worst this week.
they will be so frustrated,
like all you guys are going home
hello ladies.
hello.
you know our prizes,
the first is a contract with one of the top modeling agencies in the entire world,
elite model management.
a six-page spread and beautiful cover with Seventeen magazine,
a $100, 000 contract with cover girl cosmetics.
Mr. Nigel Barker is our first judge,
he's noted and he's sexy,
miss J Alexander is our other judge,
runway coach diva extraordinare.
miss paulina porizkova she's legendary and super and the editor and chief of seven teen magazines,
it's now time for your individual evaluations and then the judges will deliberate and determine which one is going back to America.
and Anya is first.
hello.
you and the three lovely ladies behind you had the privilege of shooting with our photographer, Mr. Nigel barker this week.
and all of you ladies were famous beautiful, women in Italy.
that were getting accosted,
Oh, no, stop, oh, no.
by the paparazzi.
let's see your best shot.
you look stunning.
I love this picture!
last week you said that my picture of Anya,
I think, was the best you thought of her in the competition,
I think that your picture of Anya is the best I really do see your beauty of who you truly are,
I think my picture was more of an interntion of it.
and Nigel caught more of the reality of your beauty and what your bones really do in your face.
you benefited from the fact that I'd already shot you once again and you won the prize four other challenges and I got to do a photo shoot with you,
so this time I already had your angles worked out.
I think was interesting for me and frustrating for J, ????
you were so surprised onset,
it worked.
it wasn't that you were control of supplies ???
and you fell and didn't seem to encapsulate a star.
I had a time with the girl,
where I was the model.
??? She's not entirely focused and freshness she brings it to from the other side of the camera,
to Anya.
I agree.
the fact she can be so real and then put on such an act here I think that that says a great thing about her as a model.
thank you, Anya.
up next is Whitney.
all right.
so, let's see your best paparazzi picture with Nigel.
I think your face look absolutely stunning.
but, I don't feel like you look very stunned.
you just look like you're looking at Nigel saying I know I'm fine.
I think the first time a photograph to do you justice,
this is how beautiful you are,
you look gorgeous???
gorgeous shoulderseses and great frame.
it seemed his acting,
pissed off the camera was taking a picture of his girl.
sometimes you've got to model and act at the same time and that makes the difference.
he's protecting you and saying get away.
and that's when you're supposed to be like,
Oh, I'm weak,
instead of oh, help me, Darling.
help me,
you're like.
I'm pretty, I'm pretty.
all right, thank you, Whitney.
up next, is Dominique.
Yeah, we got you last week,
didn't we?
okay, why today?
to cut yourself off right at the thigh line,
bad idea.
I think that's bad.
pull it up.
the part on your hips,
pull it up and show your hips.
pull it up from the bottom.
what's wrong with you,
what is wrong with me.
pull it up.
there you go. There you go, Pull it up.
it's okay if it's crunch it and tight around the back and tuck it in your butt.
Oh, like that.
you went from looking like the cool girl to more modelly.
all right, let's see your best shot with Nigel.
this is the softest one.
this is a transvestite,
I'm sorry, and you're a beautiful tranny.
dominique you have to be very careful with your face and bones of your face,
I can look tranny sometimes in picture,
I have a face that can take a lot of makeup and makeup artists get excited and i look in the mirror and I see tyrone so I'm not gonna pose like,
hard and stuff,
I soften it,
give me two faces right now,
give me that face that you do.
okay.
now, imagine if you have on that much makeup and that strong hair and what would you do to combat that and look different.
exactly.
Bella, that's exactly it.
you get it. All right.
thanks Dominique. Thank you.
last but not least, Fatima.
it's such is romantic shot.
see, again, I'm a little jealous that face is beautiful.
actually, it's so funny because like I was a little uncomfortable going there at first because I've never really had a boyfriend and don't know how to convey love
I've never been in love and maybe
have you ever been a couture in a castle? No
you did that beautifully last week with me,
models.
are hired to do things they've never done before and to sell it.
you had an extra 50 frames,
and ultimately for me,
this almost looks like a great shot for cover girl,
but not sure whether it was the right shot for this particular idea.
Yeah, I would have liked to see more,
his competition is beautiful,
lighting is beautiful and he's bringing all this have and it's up to you to that i can it to the next level,
and I don't think you did.
it's just a pretty picture.
thank you.
now it's time for the judges to deliberate and when I call you back,
we will announce.
who had her last shot.
now it's time to see who is going to end up on the paparazzi's worst dress list.
Anya lucked herself into this a little bit.
this is the best out of the bunch,
but she kind of slipped in this picture.
literally look at her foot.
it really was an accident.
as a top model you need to know you're getting that picture.
she got it,
she just oozes glamour.
she turned the slip into a hey,
or slip into an ah and I think it works.
I love what you captured with her eyes,
Nigel like a kitty cat.
that's what I see.
such a beautiful photo,
Nigel did a spectacular job,
she looks beautiful like a movie star,
but she does not look caught.
the idea of the picture has escaped her.
right, and Tyra,
the side of girls complaining not kissing not having this experience.
I've never been an aborigine or a circus ring master or a geisha or stopped me.
onset she actually came off snooty and Jay giving her recommendations what she could do and how she should do and she would go, everyday
I don't think she's a good listener and realize that every week at judging.
anen french it means i'm just so tired, Chile.
it's a beautiful picture.
stunning face.
beautiful, beautiful picture,
but I think she could have given a bit more would have taken it over the edge.
if she had looked at the camera and gone for it???
then it would have come alive.
she should use some of that va-vavoom to her advantage,
she's totally covering up her gorgeous body and she kind of has to own at that sexiness a little bit.
she looks like she wants to be caught,
she's like here, catch me.
there are people in the entertainment industry that pretend they don't want the paparazzi to shoot them and then stop.
she's not the softest girl,
she got some good angles.
girl, cat out of the bag with this one.
I think part of being "America's next top model" is winning a cover girl contract which is a makeup contract and handle that makeup.
but that's why it's called cover girl because it covers up in the man in you.
we've reached a decision.
four beautiful ladies stand before me,
but I only have three photos in my hands and these photos here represent the three of you that are still in the running towards becoming "America's next top model."
the first name I'm going to call
this shot is the strongest in the bunch,
but our photographer here says it was an accident.
so it's up to you,
now being one of the top three girls in this competition
congratulations you're still in the running towards becoming "America's next top model."
thank you.
the next name I'm going to call,
shocked and surprised?
yeah?
Yeah, you worked really hard on yourself.
and you've got a natural ability you just don't have to push it as hard as you do.
congratulations,
you're still in the running towards becoming "America's next top model."
thank you.
will Dominique and fatima please step forward?
I have one photo in my hands,
the girl that I do not call must immediately pack your belongings and go back home.
because you won the challenge.
you were given 50 extra frames because you did the not best with pall which means that your shots should have been amazing.
also, the judges feel that you overtalk them and do not listen.
and then we have Dominique,
pictures in the beginning,
she's supposed to be here and then she proved us wrong.
and your pictures started to be so stunning and so amazing and so beautiful.
the woman that we see before us has a strong face,
but the woman in her photo this week
so who stays in this competition the girl that has taken beautiful pictures throughout this competition,
but doesn't seem to listen or the girl that's taken okay pictures and has come up the ranks,
but the photo this week has made the judges a little nervous?
I'm sorry.
Fatima, it is important to listen.
I know that you want to prove that you know or prove,
I'm listening, it's okay, it's okay,
but it's turning the judges off and you almost went home because of that.
Congratulations.
you're still in the running towards becoming "America's next top model."
thank you so much. Thank you.
well, you've come a long way.
haven't you?
Yes, I have.
a very long way.
and you've got to master this face,
that's your challenge.
okay?
thank you.
thank you everybody.
it's been an amazing opportunity quite amazing,
thank you.
I'm definitely proud of myself.
I know that my story isn't over.
my story goes on.
I go on.
making it this far and learning everything I've learned is amazing,
Tyra taught me amazing things.
there's so much that's next for me,
now, I have this amazing willpower to do so much that it's,
it's fing to be a surprise what's next for Dominique.
I feel like I'm on top of the world right now even though I didn't win.
coming up on "America's next top model."
it's all down to the final three.
Anya, Fatima, and Whitney,
but a high stress cover girl commercial stands between the girls.
and high fashion runway show ever,
but there can only be one "America's next top model."
find out who on our season finale.
can you arch your back a little more as you go down?
it's hard in a dress. - I know it's hard.
last week, the girls were shocked by Lauren Brie's elimination.
Bye, girls. Good luck.
are you all female?
physically, was I born female? No.
Oh, my gosh! - How you doin'?
for one of you girls tonight, it will be your last challenge.
no photo shoot, no panel.
and with the competition more than halfway over, any of the remaining girls could make it to the top.
tonight, we'll show you what you have not seen...
bathing beauties...
I feel like I'm in a photo shoot today.
Bumblebees...
the bee is attacking.
and broken hearts.
my girlfriend went home today.
my girlfriend went home today.
I am angry.
all that and more Never-Before-Seen moments coming up tonight on "America's next top model."
well, we've never had that happen at this institute before.
welcome to the top model institute of technology,
where we build better models.
at the institute, we immediately set about calculating each girl's to???
with the latest technology.
this is the facial modulation station,
and you have to mimic the expressions that Tyra is doing In the monitor in front of you.
if you don't believe the expression, we don't believe it when you see it
like that does not look realistic at the end.
data lacking.
is that smiling? That looks like you had novocaine in your mouth.
all right, you're done, so you guys can now go over and see alpha J.
welcome to the modification movement cubes.
each time that you see the strobe flash...
that is your chance to morph into the next pose.
shape the body.
broken-down doll.
I was in there, like, trying to do my vogue
and do that weird, awkward shoulder thing, but I was trying.
next pose, please.
I made a fool of myself. I o. D.'Ed on my posing.
I mean, the kung fu came out and the "kama sutra" apparently came out.
well, we've never had that happen at this institute before.
when it came time for panel, some girls focused on their entrance...
and where they wanted to go.
I am America's next top model.
for me, this is not a choice.
I was born into this.
the competition is on, I got my game face on,
and I'm, like, hella confident.
others shared tales of where they've been.
you were chased in Alaska by a what?
a moose! Aah!
when I was younger, I had a paper route on my street.
I was walking to deliver a paper,
and there was this moose just staring me down.
can we reenact it?
you want me to reenact my - Yeah, I want you to chase me,
and I will show you how to run fiercely.
okay. Ready?
Yeah, you are good, Tyra. Man.
you got it? - Yeah, I got it.
marjorie's nerves were apparent.
Hi. - Hey.
but her awkwardness was charming.
are you nervous?
very nervous, but I'm usually nervous and really high-strung.
um, but it-it's a venting mechanism for me.
I was trying to be myself, but I was so terrified.
I think you get a rush whenever you're in front of such beautiful people.
while Isis impressed the panel with a strength and beauty that could not be categorized.
I was born physically male,
but mentally, everything else, I was born female.
some people might say that I'm transgendered.
some people might say transsexual.
personally, I prefer "born in the wrong body."
tell me about, um, when you knew that you were a girl.
as long as I can remember. It's not something I've chose.
this -This is who I always been.
Isis charmed the panel, but her competition still needed some convincing.
I am not worried about isis as competition.
as a role model, like, for America...a transvestite?
I don't think so.
I'm not letting any of these girls bother me.
I know what I'm here for.
this is the person who I am. Either take???
it wasn't easy selecting the cast for cycle 11.
but in the end, we chose 14 lucky girls who proved that they had the potential to be top models based on their distinctive looks and charisma.
I'm gonna give it my all.
and I really do wanna be America's next top model.
top model! Top model!
Hello, L. A!
but what you didn't see was the girls' need for a key before they could move into their new house.
in one of those clutches holds the key
to your new house right here in L. A.
and the girl who has the bag with the key
will have the final pick of her bed,
even if the bed is already chosen.
and there is only 13 beds.
we're all kinda like, why are there only 13 beds?
at least give us 14,
and when you don't need the other one, you can take it away.
are you ready?
Yes! - Go!
I got it! I got it!
I was like, it's a magic clutch.
Booyah! Y'all better be nice to me
or y'all ain't gettin' in my house.
moving into their new mansion, most had just one thing on their minds
finding a bed.
I'm not leaving.
the house is gorgeous.
people in Alaska do not have spreads like this place.
everybody else had gotten a bed already.
their stuff was already - They were going...oh, my god! Aah!
and I'm going, okay... this room's taken.
all right, this room's taken.
no more rooms!
Hey. - Hi.
wait, so where are you sleeping?
right here. - Oh, okay.
I'm building my nest, okay?
we all got to pick out our beds,
and Sam did not end up with a bed.
this is actually the best bed in the house, you guys.
you just don't know it yet.
I like Samantha a lot, and she's been nesting,
and I'm proud of her for sleeping on the floor.
bed made.
to kick off the competition, the girls visited Los Angeles landmark the magic castle, where they were treated to a show.
I'm Ed Alonzo...
the misfit of magic.
but what you didn't see
was Joslyn getting in on the action.
we need a volunteer from the audience to help.
could - right in the front.
give her a round of applause!
I love being onstage and being in front of people,
and just being in front of everybody
so the girls can get mad...
because he picked me.
I need to borrow a piece of clothing.
maybe your shoes?
okay, you can have this one. - Here we go, the magic hanky.
now first of all, can you feel the shoe underneath?
Yes, I feel the shoe. I feel the shoe.
Oh, yes. Here's where the magic happens.
thank y--Aah!
the finale of the magic show revealed some familiar faces.
my name is sharaun, And i am America's next top model.
my name is Sharaun.
I am America's next top model.
my name is Sharaun, and I am America's next top model.
Oh, okay, so there's nothing I can ask you then
because you have it all in the bag.
for the judges, this was a valuable opportunity to assess each girl's personality and gauge their modeling potential.
I've got my camera in my hand.
you've got a light right to the left of you.
how you gonna pose If I'm down here?
now what made you do that?
I guess because I know the light is over here,
so I'm just trying to follow your camera,
but I'm never trying to lose the light.
good answers.
Isis - I think she's actually the only one that really knew her stuff.
what would you do to make sure that we always remember you?
uh, be memorable.
bring the moose? - Oh, god!
you see? - I don't want to be remembered as the moose girl.
the first photo shoot sent a strong message to get out there and vote in this election year.
the girls were assigned political themes important for this year's election, but had to make them sexy.
okay, you ready?
some had no problem portraying their theme in a provocative manner.
good. Love it.
I would like to be an activist.
that's really what I want to do with my life.
you're smiling with your eyes, Elina.
Tyra will be proud.
I am an immigrant,
and it's definitely an issue that concerns me.
Oh, I love the concave back.
while others found the shoot more problematic.
this is not a easy shoot.
I got ballots flying at me and knocking me in the face.
Hey, Sharaun, it's looking a little convoluted.
do you know what I mean?
be careful squinting your eyes too much.
I don't have that great, great face like a lot of these girls do have, you know,
so I hope I did good. I don't know. We'll see.
at the first elimination, Sharaun's overconfident swagger during her one-on-one with the judges...
my name is sharaun, and I am America's next top model.
came back to haunt her.
the judges did not feel inspired when speaking to you.
but it was a lackluster photo that convinced the judges she was not ready to be a top model...
well, what's interesting is you don't look like the person who's protecting us.
it looks like you've sort of been handcuffed to the actual machine itself.
and she was sent home.
coming up, tempers flair when there's no meeting of the minds between Elina and Sheena.
why the hell would you want to put a dead body in your mouth?
that's disgusting.
you do have to show me that same respect,
because that's so inappropriate, Elina, 'cause I ain't never do nothing like that to you.
but it's Mckey who gets the raw deal.
we don't know you because you put on this front
I'm not girly. You know, that's girly. Like, this is girly.
tensions ran high on the ride home from the first panel during this passionate, Never-Before-Seen argument between sheena and Elina regarding animal rights.
why the hell would you want to put a dead body in your mouth?
that's disgusting.
it's a dead body.
well, we can't save every single creature on this planet.
we all play our role. We offer our bodies.
when humans die, we become the soil, and the animals feed on us.
I've dedicated my life to being an animal liberation activist.
so I've gotten into certain spats with Sheena
because I'm opinionated about my activism.
like, you wouldn't eat your cat, but you would eat a bird.
isn't vegetables and plants alive also?
that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
uh, that is not the best argument. - That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I respect the fact that you want to respect every single aspect of life.
Yes, ma'am. You do have to show me that same respect,
because that's so inappropriate, Elina, 'cause I ain't never do nothing like that to you.
my whole thing is, it's the cycle of life.
you doing you. I respect that. You don't want to eat animals.
but I don't think you have the right to come in at me disrespectfully.
okay -Soon enough in the future, humans are gonna merge with technology.
therefore, we're gonna become cyborgs. - I'm gonna go sit over there.
sheena talks a lot,
and she says a lot of nothing.
we apparently are ignorant
because we -we like to eat, uh, meat. Oh, no.
I can't take her seriously. And I can't possibly be affected by anything she says.
back at the house, another heated exchange began when some of the girls battled with their rhymes.
all right.
all right. Soon we about to have a makeover somebody is about to be over Tyra ain't gonna like it if they get mad they better take it and stop being sad get in front of the camera put it down we okay if you think you look like a clown so...
Sam is really good on the beatbox when she makes a beat.
I mean, we ain't Jay-Z and biggie or nothing like that,
but it's actually really fun.
and then is was Out-And-Out war Between Isis and brittany.
get out!
of course, it was all fun and games until someone went a little to far.
it's getting out of control. Know your role.
Isis is like, um, an older sister.
you know, she plays and plays and plays,
and sometimes I don't want to to play no more.
and I'm just like, I'm gonna have to beat this girl down.
you better not throw that at me. I'll push you in the pool.
you know, she, uh, threw some baby powder on me,
and I was like, you know, if you was anybody else, it would've been over.
but, you know, it's like a sibling thing.
she looks like a snowman.
I think that me and Brittany formed a -a pretty good bond.
she's, like, my "road dog."
all I smell is baby powder.
better than what you smelled like before.
I got baby powder.
please.
a strong competitor with a unique look, Mckey was misunderstood by some of the girls early in the competition.
who bothers you? - Mckey.
Really?
as this new footage makes very clear.
I don't know. I get this vibe that you're shy.
Yeah, there's different parts of your personality,
but we just can't figure it all out in one piece.
I'm the girl that's working out all the time.
I wear sweatpants to school every day.
that's me.
"girly" is the worst compliment anybody could give me.
Why? Why? If somebody calls me "girly," that's terrible for me.
well, that's why I don't understand.
like, you wanna be a model. You wanna wear these clothes.
but you don't want to be called... - that's very girly.
you think -You think models have to be girly? They don't.
Mckey -She's constantly labeling herself as something.
it's really hard when you're trying to get to know somebody,
and before you get to know them, it's like, "I'm weird"!
I'm this! I'm that!
you working out, it was so extreme.
like, you're beating up a...
like, what is that getting you?
I'm not even gonna lie. I was feeling really, really attacked.
everybody here is ganging up on me.
and it's not a good feeling at all.
Mckey soon adopted a new motto in the "top model" house
the way to a top model's heart is through her stomach.
who's all that soup for? - All you guys.
Mckey is really slick when it comes to this cooking deal.
I feel like she is getting us all fat. That is her strategy.
that looks amazing. - It does look really good.
me cooking for people and doing nice things for people
is just my way of connecting with people.
take a bow.
I honestly think that she's cooking just to suck up to everybody.
and, hey, it's good. I'll eat her food.
but, girlfriend, it's gettin' old and we can see straight through it.
that's good. - It's really good.
Oh, my gosh!
next, the girls get carried away at the photo shoot as they dangled from a rope ladder that put their posing skills to the test.
I wonder, if you fall, you're allowed to go back on.
Lauren Brie set an impossibly high standard with an inspired performance.
all right! - Oh, my god! You're awesome!
it was difficult. But Mr. Jay said
that I had nailed it within, like, the first five frames.
meanwhile, it was Nikeysha and Isis who couldn't hang on that day.
Ooh, my underwear is out!
Oh, lord!
would I call Nikeysha a top model today?
definitely not.
her shoot was very lackluster.
just be careful of sticking your legs back or front.
you have to think Side-To-Side more.
I kind of put all the strength into my arms.
more elegance!
so I think that I kind of strained myself a little bit more than that was necessary.
when it came time for elimination, the panel agreed that Isis had taken a major step backward with her posing at the shoot.
I think it's a dreadful picture.
I think her arms are terrible on it.
but it was Nikeysha's inability to deliver a strong photo
as well as talking over the judges
that sealed her fate.
the issues we have with you this week
it's just sad - Let me talk. Let me talk.
cause you keep talking all the time,
and your pictures weren't that great,
and you need to learn to listen.
and she was sent home.
Tyra told me that, um, I talk too much.
and I'm guessing that's pretty true.
maybe I hide my self-consciousness in the jokes and the in laughter,
but I'm strong. I'm from New York.
we don't give up. We don't break down. We strong.
and I'm-A pack my things. And I'm gonna hug my mom
because I didn't even get to call her,
because I went to go call her, and the phone was broke.
coming up, the makeover meltdown you didn't see...
they started getting into the color... aah!
and then I just saw a patch of my hair.
I literally thought half my head was gone.
after Nikeysha's elimination, the girls came home to discover a surprise waiting for them in the living room -Me.
Hello! Hello!
come in! Freakin' Tyra is in our living room.
what I wanna talk to you guys about
is how I made over my career being a supermodel.
so I start modeling. I have a very thin body.
but when I hit around 20, 21 years old,
booty started coming and breasts started coming.
and one year, my agency sat down with my mother in italy
and said, "this is a list of all the designers in italy that do not wanna hire Tyra.
she's gotta drop about 15 pounds.
and she said, "you know what we need to say to that"?
screw that. Let's order pizza.
over that pizza, we restructured my whole career.
we went to Victoria's secret and "sports illustrated,"
and that Americana, kinda girl next door thing,
and I changed my career.
but what you didn't see was a conversation I had with the girls
after I told my story.
so what y'all wanna know? Any questions?
I have a question.
Ooh! Yeah. How about you?
how do you smile with your eyes?
you guys don't know how to smile with your eyes?
this is not smiling with your eyes...
and this is smiling with your eyes...
now I see it.
any other questions?
how do you, like, look pretty and sexy without looking... pretty?
you have to learn how to do the ugly/pretty face.
so it's like try to find, like, a little bit of an anger in it,
but not where you're furrowing so much that it turns ugly.
this is the ugly/ugly face,
and this is the ugly/pretty face.
you understand that difference? - Yes.
apples.
unfortunately, our magical evening together was spoiled by one bad apple.
No!
and the evil witch was left to decide the makeovers.
I'm ready for the day...ready for the day, ready for the day.
I'm back -The evil fiercest witch.
and know it's time for makeovers!
you will get...rat's nest for hair.
and you, I will give you snakes for a weave!
girls, remember, no one can smile with her eyes Like me!
Ooh! Except...
me!
the evil fierce witch is gone,
and the good fierce witch is here with you
to make everyone pretty,
because the good fierce witch says that every young girl deserves to be pretty.
this cycle brought a record number of makeover tears.
I just don't feel like myself.
it's okay.
are you worried that your boyfriend's not gonna like it?
I don't want to look like that.
but what no one saw until now was Sheena's struggle that day.
I've got to give Sheena highlights... like me.
I just hope my hair doesn't fall off. That's my only concern.
no one could have predicted the unusual reaction Sheena's hair had to the new color.
Oh, my god!
they started getting Into the color,
and then I just...felt, like, a burn.
let me get it out.
do it slow, please.
Oh, okay.
then afterward, they brushed me out,
and then I just saw a patch of my hair.
Oh, my god. Look. Look. This is -Oh, my god.
it took a whole chunk out of my hair In the back of my head.
I literally thought half my head was gone.
so we're not gonna go with light.
we'll just kinda keep what you had as your base,
and just kinda -We'll just work...We'll just improvise.
okay.
they made me wild.
when I saw it myself, I loved it.
I feel like Tyra.
I felt like as if I was transforming into a model,
becoming that canvas, and to me, it was beautiful.
I'm just so happy things turned out the way it did.
with the most dramatic makeover of the day...
thoughts? - Ooh, it's big.
Elina's hair took on a life of its own.
this is a cat. I call this my cat.
and my cat's name is Sherry.
I will introduce myself. I will -I will say, "Hi, my name's elina, and this is sherry."
you know how to braid? - No.
sherry is very difficult to take care of,
and she's very irritating to Elina because she's so heavy.
and when she lays down it does kind of look like a cat laying on her head.
that's so funny.
this is a very nice home for small, little rodents.
eager to flaunt their new looks, the girls got a rare opportunity to take a break from the competition and enjoy a night out in Hollywood.
we arrive at a very posh Chinese restaurant.
we get this 5-course dinner.
that's a lot of food. - That's cool.
this is a good way to just relax.
it's really good. - It so is,
to appreciate one another for who we are.
I also got to dance and have fun.
sheena is downright dirty and nasty.
I'm so loose! I'm so loose! - I wanna get up and dance!
Booty-shaking time. Whoo!
she's a loser.
I think we have loser. Whatever.
Oh, shoot, we having so much fun.
then it was time for the girls to bare all in a sexy swimsuit shoot with World-Renowned photographer Russell James and supermodel turned designer Susan Holmes.
strong like that. Gorgeous.
Mckey and Elina were stunning and impressed Russell with each shot.
for Analeigh and Brittany, this simple shoot became overly complicated.
just walk, walk- walk normally.
just walk and play and move.
Brittany didn't burn any impression in my mind as a model.
just work the body a little bit more.
we are having to do this challenging posing.
I'm nervous, but I think I got a good shot.
thank you very much.
in the end, the judges decided Brittany
although very pretty -Had yet to improve as a model during her time in the competition.
she's very pretty, I think, and the face looks good,
but it doesn't work as a model.
and all that wasted potential sent her home.
I deserve this career just as much, or even more, than everybody else.
and I'm still pursuing it,
and get the hell out of Egas,
and... I'm -a do me.
coming up, Hannah reveals her secret weapon.
Hannah has this pixie dust stuff.
I don't even know what this is. This is creepy.
maybe she's just supporting her state... of ice.
after several weeks of living together, the girls naturally start to discover one another's quirks.
in Hannah's case, this took the form of a little something she liked to call Alaska pixie dust.
I just saw some powder stuff on the side of her bed.
can we show - What is that crap?
Hannah has this pixie dust stuff.
I don't even know what this is. This is creepy.
who brings that with them? That's so weird.
well, maybe she's gonna write it in glue,
and then take pixie dust, like... ooh!
Hannah's Alaskan pixie dust - I don't know what the hell that is.
maybe she's just supporting her state... of ice.
I'm gonna sprinkle Alaskan pixie dust on you.
Oh, my god!
alaska pixie dust is something that my mom made for me.
alaska pixie dust protects me from mean girls
and it protects me from getting my feelings hurt.
alaska pixie dust...???
you have to...???
?? I don't know.
it won't work for anyone else but me.
it's exclusive.
a runway challenge for famed designer Jeremy Scott brought with it one surprise after another.
tonight, there's one little twist...
Oh, boy.
you will be blindfolded.
What?!
Oh, my gosh, am I nervous. Blindfolded?
I have no idea if I have a good walk or not.
and we're gonna be blindfolded?!
because it's time to get serious and ramp up the competition,
for one of you girls tonight, it will be your last challenge.
how do you feel? - Amazing.
you were raising your dress. Do not model like that.
okay.
despite the blindfolds, most of the girls performed like pros during the show.
walking on the runway is one of the best natural highs you will ever get.
even if you suck, you feel so cool.
unfortunately, there were two exceptions.
Samantha compromised the designer's vision with a provocative turn at the end of the runway.
I told her 15 times not to do that. Look at her.
while Hannah's trip to the catwalk was anything but graceful.
I step out on the runway for the first time, and I'm so nervous.
after such a great show, it was sad that someone still had to go.
unfortunately, the young lady that'll be going home tonight...
that was my very best walk I've ever done in my life.
if it really was that bad,
then that means it doesn't get worse.
I just can't wait to see my mom and dad, 'cause I know they're just - they're so proud of me right now,
and gosh, that means so much.
the surprise elimination shook the house and some of the girls sizing up who was left in the competition.
I think Isis looks like a possessed hyena.
honestly, that's the best way I can describe her -Some sort of dragon.
like, she doesn't even look like a model at all.
she's not tall enough, she doesn't have the face for it.
I don't know.
sometimes, if you load half a bucket of makeup on Isis
and cover half her face with her hair,
then she might look like a model if she stands still.
she's not tall enough?
no, she's, like, 5'7."
most -most runway models... - Okay.
I'm just looking at the industry.
there just an inherent... almost arrogance, I'm gonna say, about Elina.
Elina really wants to be taken seriously.
but -But then every teenager wants to be taken seriously.
our very own nigel barker Was the photographer for the next shoot that focused on a top model essential
smiling with your eyes.
posing while submerged in the water was a challenge for all.
I don't know. I'm stuck.
but for Joslyn, it was a matter of survival.
I get into the water and I'm drowning.
I'm like, okay, I'm drowning! I'm drowning!
you can't swim, right? - Uh, no.
I knew you couldn't swim. I could tell.
try and keep it together.
I was not the same Joslyn that I usually am on land.
meanwhile, Isis was too preoccupied worrying about a wardrobe malfunction to keep from sinking.
I have on, like, three pair of undergarments
just in case the tape did peel off because of the water.
a little more power, Isis. A little more power in the eyes.
it's a little sleepy looking.
I think Isis was really concerned
about wearing a swimsuit and posing in the water.
eyes wider.
I feel like I've been going to the shoots nervous
and really not giving all of what I think I can.
the look in your eyes are like, "maybe I didn't do such a good job."
what we're trying to do is give you the right feedback to understand
how to move forward from that.
they want my personality back. That's what got me here.
so I'm just trying to keep that.
Clark finally stepped up her game and dazzled Nigel with her gaze.
so hot what are you thinking right now?
I'm thinking I'm laying on a bed.
you think you're lying on a bed?
Yeah.
actually, what I think Clark was doing
straight up flirting with Nigel.
and although Samantha had a dynamic shoot...
I like the body coming out of the water like that.
I like that a lot.
when it came time for elimination, she found herself in the bottom two because of her offensive turn on the runway.
but the designer, Jeremy Scott,
was so insulted by what you did on that runway.
you were touching your body. You were raising your dress.
as a designer, you're representing me when you're out there.
it's not your show. You're not a rock star.
but it was Isis who failed to live up to her posing potential.
on this picture, your arm is more important than your eyes.
okay. - That's not a good picture.
she not only didn't smile with her eyes, the judges felt she may have fallen asleep...
from week to week, you've continued to look
sleepier and sleepier in your film.
and she was sent home.
thank you for seeing something in me,
or even feeling like I was the one that was even capable of breaking a barrier like this.
I'm ready to jump in this industry,
and I just pray that everything will fall into place for me.
coming up, the "top model" girls get close... real close.
marjorie and Analeigh
they're hugging, they're kissing all the time.
I'm like, it's a competition, dude. Get a grip.
"America's next top model" xares about the environment, as exemplified in this Never-Before-Seen footage in which some of the girls practiced conserving water.
Oh, my eye!
I am bonding with a few girls,
and we're learning and growing together in this experience,
and I think that's what draws us together.
get a hug in.
we can't. It won't let us. - Yeah.
everyone in the house is like,
we're really getting along now.
and it's great that we should be bonding.
here you go. - That doesn't help!
I just go with the flow. That's how I live.
when an uninvited guest dropped in one night at the "top model" house...
is that a bee I see?
the result was simply Un-Bee-Lievable.
what in the world?
the bee is attacking.
Oh, there it is.
don't hurt it.
I'm not gonna hurt - Mckey -No!
I can't stand the sound of bees. I don't like them near me.
but I refuse to kill them.
get a pillow.
let's spray something at it.
don't hurt it!
I don't think that killing a bee is necessary,
and if you're going to do it, then you should at least do it In a humane way.
no more spray. - Mckey!
give me my hairspray. - No. It's my bee.
I think we should just smush him. He's dead.
Yeah, he's dead. - Mckey, now he's gonna die in misery.
so I took the little bee outside and got some water,
and I dabbed water all around him.
is it thirsty? - I don't know.
all the other girls are sitting there, laughing like it's funny.
you know, all serial killers start by killing small.
I know bugs aren't really considered on that scale,
but hey... just sayin'.
okay, now that the bee's gone, we have no form of entertainment.
this week, it was attack of the 50-Foot models, as the girls wreaked havoc as natural disasters In their photo shoot.
just let it out.
I'm glad I got earthquake, cause it's passionate and very kind of angry.
Samantha and Mckey swept over their competition in their shoots, depicting a tidal and heat wave respectively.
Samantha literally created a wall of water.
it looked like a tidal wave.
good job, Sam!
Oh, that's cool.
that's what we want, some energy.
Mr. Jay gave me absolutely wonderful feedback.
Ooh! Cool!
while Joslyn and clark looked rigid on their sets, unable to find a pose without Mr. Jay's coaching.
what if you were in a motion,
like you were trying to destroy the cars down there?
maybe Mr. Jay feels like I'm not improving,
but I'm really, really trying my hardest.
what about if you sat - Even sat down on that building?
Clark -I just wished she'd come alive when she stepped on set.
I kept asking and asking and asking.
a little more grit, a little more - Clench the jaw a little more.
Yeah. But not too ugly.
at panel, the judges worried that Joslyn was sliding backwards with her recent shoots.
what has happened to Joslyn?
she had such great pictures week to week.
and then just recently, it got zapped out of her.
but it was Clark who seemed stuck.
after a top photo the week before, she failed to deliver in her shoot...
I felt, looking through your film,
you weren't thinking about a blackout at all.
I think you got stuck on pretty and weren't thinking about
I mean, blackout...
and she was eliminated.
I definitely feel like I got robbed out of this competition.
I could've taken it so much farther.
I'm proud of myself.
Yeah, it sucks being eliminated. Don't get me wrong.
but it means so much to even have been given this opportunity.
it's no secret that Elina had always been fond of clark.
so it wasn't surprising that after clark's elimination there was no consoling her.
Oh, my god. I cannot believe Clark went home today.
Clark is beautiful, tall, thin.
She's...she looks like a frickin' model.
Joslyn looks like...hair show model
at the mall somewhere in the middle of nowhere.
my girlfriend went home today.
I do not want to think about this.
meanwhile, there were other strong attachments that formed in the "top model" house this cycle.
some of the girls got close... very close.
Hey!
you're next to me!
Yeah, I know!
marjorie and Analeigh -They are very close.
like, weirdly close.
they take baths together.
they're hugging, they're kissing all the time.
I'm like, it's a competition, dude. Get a grip.
look at you.
big lioness.
"no, you're better."'No, you're better"!
I just wanna, like, pop 'em.
this competition is exhausting.
most girls use their little downtime for much needed r & r...
but not Mckey.
coming here, I was really, really worried about my training routine.
I had my boyfriend put together a nice little list of everything I should do.
so I worked out today, and I felt so good.
I ran about 48 times around the pool.
Mckey-She-She cracks me up.
she does crazy things, but that's Mckey.
I got here with the body I have,
so I'm gonna try and maintain it the best I can while I'm here.
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna keep on that fitness regime like you wouldn't believe.
good times!
then it was time to bring on the glamour at a photo shoot inspired by all those unscripted moments at awards shows that keep things interesting.
Marjorie, what are you again?
I want to pee, and I can't get out of my gown.
marjorie and Analeigh had no trouble getting into character and finding interesting poses that conveyed their story.
she actually flushed the toilet!
there you go. That's perfect. - Yes! Yes! I love it!
the bored -Like, ugh. - You do bitchy really well.
I don't think I'm a typically catty person.
so it was uncomfortable, but it was kind of fun.
Lauren Brie looked more beautiful than ever...
you look really good this way, by the way. - Thank you.
but her shoot was stiff and uninspired.
it's feeling...
Posed?- Pose-Y and forced, okay?
Lauren Brie looked like a mannequin falling down.
at panel, it was not only Lauren Brie's photo that failed to impress the judges.
it's not really believable, but that being said,
maybe you were going up for the award for supergirl.
but more so, it was her lack of personality throughout the competition that left them flat...
Lauren Brie is that gorgeous, high fashion beauty,
but what's lacking is the personality of Sheena.
and she was sent home.
going home is...
I mean, it sucks, but I love who I am,
so I'm not willing to change that for them.
next time someone takes a blow to my personality,
I can't let it affect me as much, and just go out there and prove them wrong.
now seven girls remain
Marjorie, the awkward yet incredible photogenic girl that hails from France...
Sheena, the sassy and sexy girl from Harlem, New York...
elina, the stoic stunner from Seattle...
Samantha, the spunky and fun-loving girl from Woodland Hills, California...
Analeigh, the pretty and peace-loving girl from Sacramento, California...
Joslyn, the sweetheart with the unmistakable voice from lucky, Louisiana, and Mckey, the statuesque beauty from Lake Forest, Illinois.
your Highness...
there was a time, not very long ago, when we lived in an enchanted world of elegant palaces and grand parties.
the year was 1916
and my son Nicholas was the Czar of lmperial Russia.
Hello, darling.
we were celebrating the 300th anniversary of our family's rule.
and, that night, no star burned brighter than that of our sweet Anastasia, my youngest granddaughter.
she begged me not to return to Paris, so I had a very special gift made for her to make the separation easier for both of us.
for me? Is it a jewelry box?
Dimitri! You belong in the kitchen.
look.
it plays our lullaby.
you can play it at night before you go to sleep and pretend that it's me singing.
read what it says.
together in Paris.
Really? Oh, Grandmamma.
but we would never be together in Paris, for a dark shadow had descended upon the house of the Romanovs.
his name was Rasputin.
we thought he was a holy man, but he was a fraud, power-mad and dangerous.
how dare you return to the palace?
but I am your confidant.
confidant?
you are a traitor. Get out.
you think you can banish the great Rasputin?
by the unholy powers vested in me, I banish you with a curse!
mark my words.
you and your family will die within the fortnight.
I will not rest until I see the end of the Romanov line forever!
consumed by his hatred for Nicholas and his family,
Rasputin sold his soul for the power to destroy them.
go.
fulfill your dark purpose and seal the fate of the Czar and his family once and for all.
from that moment on, the spark of unhappiness in our country was fanned into a flame that would soon destroy our lives forever.
help! - Hurry, children.
my music box. - Anastasia!
come back! Come back!
please, hurry. - Come this way. Out the servants' quarters.
hurry, Anastasia. - Rasputin, she's getting away.
my music box. - Go! Go!
comrades, in here!
where are they, boy?
Grandmamma... - Keep up with me, darling.
Rasputin! - Let me go. Please.
you'll never escape me, child. Never!
master!
Anastasia, hurry. Hurry.
Grandmamma! - Here, take my hand.
hold onto my hand. - Don't let go!
so many lives were destroyed that night.
what had always been was now gone forever.
and my Anastasia, my beloved grandchild,
I never saw her again.
saint Petersburg is gloomy
saint Petersburg is bleak
my underwear got frozen standing here all week
since the Revolution our lives have been so gray
thank goodness for the gossip that gets us through the day
have you heard there's a rumor in Saint Petersburg?
have you heard what they're saying on the street?
although the Czar did not survive, one daughter may be still alive
the Princess Anastasia
but please do not repeat
it's a rumor, a legend, a mystery
something whispered in an alleyway or through a crack
it's a rumor that's part of our history
they say her royal grandmamma will pay a royal sum
to someone who can bring the princess back
a ruble for this painting
it's Romanov, I swear
count Yusupov's pajamas - comrades, buy the pair
I got this from the palace, it's lined with real fur
it could be worth a fortune if it belonged to her
well, Dimitri, I got us a theater.
everything's going according to plan. All we need is the girl.
just think, Vlad, no more forging papers, no more stolen goods.
we'll have three tickets out of here: one for you, one for me and one for Anastasia.
it's the rumor, the legend, the mystery
it's the Princess Anastasia who will help us fly
you and l, friend, will go down in history
we'll find a girl to play the part and teach her what to say
dress her up and take her to Paree
imagine the reward her dear old grandmamma will pay
who else could pull it off but you and me?
we'll be rich - We'll be rich - We'll be out - We'll be out
and Saint Petersburg will have some more to talk about
have you heard there's a rumor in Saint Petersburg?
have you heard what they're saying on the street?
have you heard there's a rumor in Saint Petersburg?
have you heard? Comrades, what do you suppose?
a fascinating mystery - The biggest con in history
the Princess Anastasia
alive or dead?
who knows?
I got you a job in the fish factory.
you go down this path till you get to the fork in the road. Go left...
Bye!
are you listening? - Bye, everybody!
I'm listening, Comrade Phlegmenkoff.
you've been a thorn in my side since you were brought here.
acting like the Queen of Sheba instead of the nameless no-account you are.
for the last ten years, I've fed you, I've clothed you, I've...
kept a roof over my head.
how is it you don't have a clue who you were before you came to us, but you can remember all that?
I do have a clue to... - I know.
together in Paris.
so, you want to go to France to find your family?
little Miss Anya, it's time to take your place in life.
in life and in line.
and be grateful, too.
together in Paris"!
be grateful.
be grateful, Anya.
I am grateful. Grateful to get away.
go left" she says.
well, I know what's to the left. I'll be "Anya the orphan" forever.
but if I go right, maybe I could find...
whoever gave me this necklace must have loved me.
this is crazy. Me? Go to Paris?
send me a sign.
a hint.
anything!
I don't have time to play right now, OK? I'm waiting for a sign.
would you please leave me alone? Gimme that back.
great. A dog wants me to go to Saint Petersburg.
OK, I can take a hint.
heart, don't fail me now
courage, don't desert me
don't turn back
now that we're here
people always say
life is full of choices
no one ever mentions fear
or how the world can seem so vast
on a journey
to the past
somewhere down this road
I know someone's waiting
years of dreams just can't be wrong
arms will open wide
I'll be safe and wanted
finally home where I belong
well, starting now
I'm learning fast
on this journey
to the past
home, love, family
there was once a time I must have had them, too
home, love, family
I will never be complete
until I find you
one step at a time
one hope, then another
who knows where this road may go?
back to who I was
on to find my future
things my heart still needs to know
Yes, let this be a sign
let this road be mine
let it lead me to my past
and bring me home
at last - One ticket to Paris, please. - Exit visa.
exit visa? - No exit visa, no ticket.
see Dimitri. He can help.
where can I find him? - At the old palace.
but you didn't hear it from me.
go, go, go. - Dimitri...
nice. Nice. Very nice.
and I look like princess. - OK...
I dance like a feather. - Thank you. Thank you. Next, please.
grandma, it's me.
brother.
that's it, Dimitri. Game over.
our last kopeck gone for this flea-infested theater and still no girl to pretend to be Anastasia.
we'll find her, Vlad. She's here somewhere, right under our noses.
one look at this jewelry box, the Empress will think we have the real Anastasia.
I'm looking for... - Before she catches on, we'll be off spending the 10 million rubles.
pooka, where are you?
did you hear something? - No.
Hello?
anybody home?
this place.
it's...
it's like a memory from a dream.
dancing bears
painted wings
things I almost remember
and a song
someone sings
someone holds me safe and warm
horses prance through a silver storm
figures dancing gracefully
someone holds me safe and warm
horses prance through a silver storm
figures dancing gracefully
far away, long ago
glowing dim as an ember
things my heart used to know
things it yearns to remember
and a song
someone sings
what are you doin' in here?
stop! Stop, stop, stop!
hold on a minute. Hold on!
now, how did you get in here?
excuse me, child...
Vlad, do you see what I see?
no.
Yes. Yes!
are you Dimitri? - Cute.
perhaps. Depends on who's looking for him.
my name is Anya. I need travel papers.
they say you're the man to see, even though I can't tell you who said that.
and what... Hey, why are you circling me?
what, were you a vulture in another life? - I'm sorry, Anneya.
it's Anya. - Anya.
it's just that you look an awful lot like...
never mind. Now, you said something about travel papers?
Yes. I'd like to go to Paris.
you'd like to go to Paris? - Who is this here?
look. He likes me. - Nice dog.
now, let me ask you something... Anya, was it?
there's a last name that goes with that? - Well, actually...
this is gonna sound crazy. I don't know my last name.
I was found wandering around when I was eight years old.
and before that? Before you were eight?
I know it's strange, but I don't remember. I have very few memories of my past.
that's perfect.
I do have one clue, however. And that is Paris.
Paris?
right. So can you two help me or not?
Vlad, Vlad, tickets.
sure would like to. In fact, oddly enough, we're going to Paris ourselves.
and I've got three... Well, this one is... But I've got three tickets here.
unfortunately, the third one is for her.
we are going to reunite the Grand Duchess Anastasia with her grandmother.
you do kind of resemble her. - The same blue eyes.
the Romanov eyes. - Nicholas' smile.
Alexandra's chin. - Look.
she even has the grandmother's hands.
she's the same age, the same physical type.
are you trying to tell me you think that I am Anastasia?
I've seen thousands of girls all over the country.
not one of them looks as much like the Grand Duchess as you.
look at the portrait. - I knew you were crazy.
but now I think you are both mad. - Why?
you don't remember what happened to you. - No one knows what happened to her.
you're looking for family, in Paris.
and her only family is in Paris.
have you ever thought about the possibility?
that I could be royalty?
well, it's kind of hard to think of yourself as a duchess when you're sleeping on a damp floor.
but, sure, every lonely girl would hope she's a princess.
and, somewhere, one little girl is.
after all, the name Anastasia means "she will rise again.
wish we could help, but the third ticket is for the Grand Duchess Anastasia.
good luck.
why didn't you tell her about our brilliant plan?
all she wants to do is go to Paris. Why give away a third of the reward money?
I tell you, we're walking away too soon.
not to worry. I got it all under control.
all right, but walk a little slower.
three, two, one...
Dimitri! - Right in the palm of our hand.
Dimitri, wait! - Did you call me?
if I don't remember who I am, then who's to say I'm not a princess or a duchess, right?
go on.
if I'm not Anastasia, the Empress will know right away.
so it's just an honest mistake. - Sounds plausible.
but, if you are the princess, then you'll finally know who you are and have your family back.
you know, he's right.
either way, it gets you to Paris. - Right.
may I present Her Royal Highness, the Grand Duchess Anastasia?
pooka, we are going to Paris. - No, the dog stays.
what are you saying? The dog goes. - The dog does not go.
I say he's going. - I'm allergic to dogs.
Anastasia? You have just one problem there, fella. Anastasia's dead.
all the Romanovs are dead. They're dead.
dead, dead, dead.
am I right, my friend? I mean, how could that be Ana...
Oh, come on. Am I supposed to believe that thing woke up after all these years just because some guy claims she's a Romanov?
OK, OK, I get the message. Enough already with the glowing and the smoke people.
if that thing's come back to life, it must mean Anastasia's alive.
leave the dog. - I am not leaving the dog.
and that's her. - We've got a train to catch.
Mayday! Mayday!
it's hot!
Oh, boy.
Ow! I tell you what... Ow!
who dares intrude on my solitude?
get out! Out!
Bartok? Is that you?
master? You're alive?
Yes. In a manner of speaking.
whoa, that fell right out there, sir.
something's happened. - Yeah.
whoopsie. - I knew it.
I could feel the dark forces stirring.
I'm not surprised, because I saw her. Anastasia.
Anastasia? Alive?
sir, your lips, they're...
that Romanov brat!
ain't that the kick in the head? I guess a curse just ain't what it used to be.
that's why I was stuck here in limbo.
my curse is unfulfilled!
look at me.
I am falling apart!
I'm a wreck!
actually, considering how long you've been dead, you look pretty good.
sir, you do. You do. - Really?
sir, is this the face of a bat who would lie to you?
come on, for a minute there, you had your old spark back.
if only I hadn't lost the gift from the dark forces.
the key to my powers.
what? You mean this reliquary?
where did you get that? - I found it.
give it to me! - All right, all right. Don't get so grabby.
my old friend.
together again.
now my dark purpose will be fulfilled.
and the last of the Romanovs will die!
in the dark of the night I was tossing and turning
and the nightmare I had was as bad as can be
it scared me out of my wits
a corpse falling to bits
then I opened my eyes and the nightmare was me
I was once the most mystical man in all Russia
when the royals betrayed me they made a mistake
my curse made each of them pay
but one little girl got away
little Anya beware, Rasputin's awake
in the dark of the night, evil will find her
in the dark of the night, just before dawn
revenge will be sweet
when the curse is complete - In the dark of the night - She'll be gone!
Hi, ladies. Listen, l...
I can feel that my powers are slowly returning
tie my sash, add a dash of cologne for that smell
as the pieces fall into place
I'll see her crawl into place
do svidaniya, Anya, Your Grace
farewell - In the dark of the night, terror will strike her - Terror's the least I can do!
in the dark of the night, evil will brew
soon she will feel
that her nightmares are real
in the dark of the night
she'll be through!
in the dark of the night, evil will find her
find her
in the dark of the night, terror comes through - Doom her - My dear, here's a sign
it's the end of the line
in the dark of the night
in the dark of the night
come, my minions
rise for your master
let your evil shine
in the dark of the night
find her now
Yes, fly ever faster
in the dark of the night In the dark of the night
she'll be mine!
the mutt gets the window seat.
stop fiddling with that. Sit up straight. Remember, you're a grand duchess.
how do you know what grand duchesses do or don't do?
I make it my business to know.
look, Anya, I'm just trying to help, all right?
Dimitri, do you really think I'm royalty?
you know I do. - Then stop bossing me around.
she certainly has a mind of her own.
Yeah. I hate that in a woman.
look, I think we got off on the wrong foot. - I think we did too.
but I appreciate your apology. - Apology?
an apology? I was just saying...
please, don't talk anymore. It's only gonna upset me.
fine. I'll be quiet, if you will. - All right, I'll be quiet.
fine. - Fine.
fine. - Fine.
think you'll miss it? - Miss what, your talking?
no. Russia.
Nope. - But it was your home.
it was a place I once lived.
then you plan on making Paris your home?
what is it with you and homes?
well, for one thing, it's something every normal person wants.
for another thing, you... - What?
just forget it. - Fine.
thank goodness it's you. Please, remove him from my sight.
what have you done to her? - Me? It's her.
an unspoken attraction.
attraction? That skinny little brat? Have you lost your mind?
only asking a simple question. - Attraction. Ridiculous!
last month, the traveling papers were blue.
but now they are red.
papers. Papers, please.
it's what I hate about this government.
everything's in red. - Red?
I propose we move to the baggage car before the guards come.
I propose we get off this train.
sorry. I thought you were someone else.
it's you. Well, that's OK then.
we've got to go. - Where are we going?
I think you broke my nose.
men are such babies.
Yes. Yes, this will do nicely.
she'll freeze in here. - She can thaw in Paris.
the baggage car? There's nothing wrong with our papers, is there, maestro?
of course not, Your Grace.
it's just that I hate to see you forced to mingle with all those commoners.
what was that? - I don't know.
but there goes the dining car.
get off of me! - I'm trying.
Dimitri! - What?
I think someone has flambeed our engine.
something's not right.
wait here. I'll check it out.
anybody here?
we're going way too fast!
nobody's driving this train. We're gonna have to jump.
did you say jump?
after you. - Fine. Then we'll uncouple the car.
come on! I need a wrench, an ax, anything!
here.
come on, there's gotta be something in there better than this!
that'll work.
go, go, go!
what did they teach you in the orphanage?
the brakes are out!
turn harder!
don't worry. We've got plenty of track. We'll just coast to a stop.
you were saying?
I got an idea, Vlad. Gimme a hand with this.
hand me the chain.
not you! - Vlad's busy at the moment.
and to think that could have been you.
if we live through this, remind me to thank you.
here goes nothin'. Brace yourselves.
well, this is our stop.
I hate trains. Remind me never to get on the train again.
Wow.
take it easy there. Sir, really, you should watch your blood pressure.
my nephew, lzzie, just keeled over one day, mid-mango.
stress, it's a killer, sir. And he's a fruit bat.
no meat. No blood, even.
how could they let her escape?
you're right. It's very upsetting, sir.
I guess this reliquary's broken.
you idiot!
all right now, sir. Take it easy there. Just remember what I said to you about stress.
I sold my soul for this.
my life, my very existence, depends on it.
and you almost destroyed it.
I get it. I get it. You break it, you bought it.
see that you remember, you miserable rodent!
sure, blame the bat. We're easy targets.
what are you muttering about?
Anastasia, sir. Just wishing I could do the job for you, sir.
I'd give her a... and a...
and then a...
and I'd kick her, sir.
I have something else in mind.
something more enticing.
something really cruel.
are we gonna walk to Paris? - We'll take a boat in Germany.
then we're walking to Germany? - No, Your Grace, we're taking a bus.
a bus.
that's nice.
Sophie, my dear!
Vlady's on his way!
who's Sophie? - Who's Sophie? She's a tender little morsel.
a cup of hot chocolate after a long walk in the snow.
Vlad, ix-nay on the Ophie-say.
she's a decadent pastry filled with whipped cream and laughter.
is this a person or a cream puff? - She is the Empress' ravishing first cousin.
but I thought we were going to see the Empress herself.
why are we going to see her cousin?
well, nobody gets near the Dowager Empress without convincing Sophie first.
no. Not me. No.
nobody told me I had to prove I was the Grand Duchess.
look... - Show up, yes. Look nice, fine.
but lie? - You don't know it's a lie. What if it's true?
OK, so it's one more stop on the road to finding out who you are.
I thought this was something you had to see through to the end.
look at me, Dimitri. I am not exactly grand duchess material here.
tell me, child. What do you see?
I see a skinny little nobody with no past and no future.
I see an engaging and fiery young woman, who, on occasion, has shown a regal command equal to any royal in the world.
and I have known my share of royalty.
you see, my dear,
I was a member of the lmperial Court.
so, are you ready to become the Grand Duchess Anastasia?
what? - There is nothing left for you back there.
everything is in Paris.
gentlemen, start your teaching.
I remember it well.
you were born in a palace by the sea
a palace by the sea?
could it be? - Yes, that's right.
you rode horseback when you were only three.
horseback riding? Me?
and the horse... - He was white.
you made faces and terrorized the cook - Threw him in the brook - Was I wild? - Wrote the book.
but you'd behave when your father gave that look - lmagine how it was - Your long-forgotten past
we've lots and lots to teach you And the time is going fast
all right. I'm ready.
now shoulders back and stand up tall - And do not walk, but try to float.
I feel a little foolish. Am I floating? - Like a little boat.
you give a bow - What happens now?
your hand receives a kiss
most of all, remember this
if I can learn to do it, you can learn to do it - Something in you knows it - There's nothing to it
follow in my footsteps, shoe by shoe
you can learn to do it, too - Now elbows in and sit up straight. - And never slurp the stroganoff.
I never cared for stroganoff. - She said that like a Romanov.
the samovar. - The caviar.
dessert and then good night?
not until you get this right
if I can learn to do it, you can learn to do it
pull yourself together and you'll pull through it
tell yourself it's easy and it's true
you can learn to do it, too
next, we memorize the names of the royalty.
now here we have Kropotkin - Shot Potemkin - In the Botkin
and dear old Uncle Vanya loved his vodka - Got it, Anya? - No.
the Baron Pushkin - He was short - Count Anatoly - Had a wart - Count Sergei - Wore a feathered hat
I hear he's gotten very fat
and I recall his yellow cat
I don't believe we told her that.
if you can learn to do it, I can learn to do it - Don't know how you knew it - I simply knew it
suddenly I feel like someone new
Anya, you're a dream come true - If I can learn to do it - You can learn to do it - You can learn to do it - Pull yourself together
and you'll pull through it - Tell yourself it's easy - And it's true - You can learn to do it - Nothing to it
you can learn to do it, too
here. I bought you a dress.
you bought me a tent.
what are you lookin' for? - The Russian Circus. I think it's still in here.
come on. Just put it on.
checkmate.
wonderful!
marvelous!
and now you are dressed for a ball.
and you will learn to dance for one as well.
I'm... I'm not very good at it.
and...
wealth is too Precious to be entrusted to the Rich.

please, the Free Trade Alliance never met a monopoly it didn't like.
I only have one question. What are we talking about?
analyzing.
Trans-Galactic Shipping and Quantum Express are two of the largest private cargo carriers in the sector.
their consolidation would...
would force small operators out of business by red-lining business and undercutting costs.
how is a little guy supposed to compete against someone like Sam Profit?

Heya, boss? You know a guy named Sid Barry?
Yeah, he was my father's business partner. Why?

I hate to come to like this, but I need to see you.
there's an attached file with contact information.
I'm not going to beg you, Rebecca, but we both know your dad owes me one.
I guess I'm calling in my marker on the... the Valentine family huh?
I hope to see you soon.

I...hope it's not too serious. That message is over three years old.

and the odds of finding him at all are like really really small.
you know, if you don't want me to go, why don't you just say so?
I don't want you to go.
damn. I didn't think you'd just say so.
we haven't got much time before the storm hits, and we need the Maru to carry supplies.
one of Andromeda's pods can handle it.
our pods aren't designed for moving cargo.
okay, they are, but...
...you speak Drift, and it's been a long time since I've bought anything.
blood of my blood, Dylan. That's what my father used to call me.
all my life, he never asked me for one thing.
now he's gone. And if I can pay back a debt for him,...
...I don't see how I have a choice.
solar storm hits in five days. Can you be back by then?
I better be.
can't trust you to fly us out of class seven storm.
we'll be here. Good luck.
autopilot engaged.
let me guess. Dylan asked you to keep an eye on me.
well, actually, Dylan wanted to send Rev Bem, but changed his mind 'cause of the strom.
...so nobody left, and I didn't want him to worry, I decided to sneak on board and here I am now.
are you mad at me? - Hm?
how can I be mad, Trance? I don't even know what you're talking about.
Oh.
don't worry, I'll look after her. Love, Trance.
so? - So now I'm worried.
they're both big girls. They can take care of themselves.
besides, we have plenty to worry about right here.
I say we prioritize the picotransducers, nanothrusters, and...an AP solenoid valve.
we can agree on the thrusters and the valve,...
...but we also need photon bombs, and we need to refit our pulse plasma guns and point defense lasers.
isn't this a lot of wishful thinking? How are we going to pay for all of this?
technically that would be the quartermaster's job.
we don't have a quartermaster.
are you saying we don't have any money?
Oh we have plenty of currency, it's just that none of it's...current.
okay, I can get most of this stuff, but we'll have to rig for a fast getaway.
Harper! - Harper, we're not going to steal anything.
thank you.
well, what would you suggest?
there's an old Earth custom, Tyr. It's called...a garage sale.
what's a garage?
Yuck! I hate planets. How could anyone live like this?
well, didn't your people evolve on a planet?
Yeah, the smart ones left, as soon as they got a chance.
brain dead flash fryers.
is that fun? - What fun?
squirting drugs into your eyeballs, because it seems like human beings enjoy poisoning themselves.
well, it's not really that simple Trance. Flash is a synaptic enhancer.
it makes you stronger, better, faster.
dad always said it made a great solution if you don't make it your...problem.
okay, so this is Avenida Nuevo Ciudad. This is supposed to be the place.
Ninety-four...ninety-two...ninety. Right there!
but...I think we're too late.
Sid's address but no Sid.
Ohhh great.
the light fixtures in the crew cabins can go.
sports equipment...stays.
we need weapons, not toys.
we need a crew that hasn't gone crazy from lack of recreation.
Oh, anyone who...touches my basketball hoop answers to me personally.
Oh oh, the drift trader that you're meeting is called Grask. Now he's a...Chichin.
Oh great. - Yes, they never buy what they can steal.
they're scum. They eat their own young.
I'll thank you to see that he comes nowhere near me.
Mmm...probably a good idea.
Yeah, make a note of that.
that's ceremonial china from the Than ambassador. - Really?
sounds like a spool of superconductor wire to me!
if I don't keep my eyes open, he'll probably sell the...
Rommie. Rommie. Would I...hurt you?
Hey, whoa!
where you goin' with all this good stuff?
that stays.
What'd I do?
personal effects of the crew.
Hey, I'm looking for a guy.
lucky you, you just found one.
a specific guy.
his name's Sid Barry. You ever seen him?
I not your type?
you know what they say, once you try bio-engineered, you never go back.
I think she's into older men.
what about you, sweetness, are you into older men?
or are you just into her?
watch the tail. - You know, grape's my favorite flavor.
Beka, are they cannibals?
C'mon baby, give me some sugar.
what the hell is that? - Sugar cane.
trance, your left! Other left!
you want him? The guy in the picture.
I know where you can find him.
Ohhh wow, this is amazing! That's real wood.
look at you, with your blond hair! I hardly recognized you.
what are you doing here?
I got an old message. I thought you needed help.
Oh.oh that.well...
...that's kind of complicated. - Mister Profit, line three.
profit? You work for Sam Profit?
Heh. Well, not exactly, I...
...I am Sam Profit.
this is it.
is this your room?
not at all my dear, it's your room. And yours too.
fit for a princess. Her daddy's little princess.
I still don't get it. How can you be Sam Profit?
you really had no idea?
the word shocked comes to mind. Amazed. Dumfounded.
so why'd you come all this way?
she came here to help you. - I came here to help Sid Barry.
remember him? - I'm still Sid.
not from where I'm standing.
when I was a kid,...
...you and my dad would stand around and complain about the big shipping companies.
now you're the one buying up the trade routes and forcing out people like us.
curse the big companies all you want, but big companies get things done.
and small operators don't?
you know, why don't I...walk around.
okay, this is me leaving.
it's all about moving things, kiddo. People, cargo.
the more things move, the more they connect, and the more they connect, the safer the universe gets.
and the richer you get.
money is not a disease. It's the cure.
let me ask you something: What was your father after his whole life?
redheads.
the big score. - Exactly!
and this is it!
he may not have admitted it, but this is what he was after.
this is what he wanted. What we wanted.
but you know what, enough about me.
is there anything you want?
chocolate!
I don't know. This is not what I was expecting.
hold that thought.
mister Profit, time for your Quantum run.
well, Quantum waits for no man. I've got to get back to the office.
by the way, you look a little tense. I hear Rutger has great hands.
Oh yeah?
what's so great about them?
trance... do not let him buy you off with a back rub.
this is Sam Profit we're dealing with.
I think you're just...cranky from the gravity.
why don't you just think of this as a way to... decreasing his corporate resources.
now, let's start with the tail.
is this receptacle hemititer or lixx?
I...think it's black plastic.
Oh. Too bad. It might have had value.
This...microsensor might have had value too if you... hadn't removed the fuel cell.
removed? No, not removed! Never removed.
Leeshka! My apprentice. Has the brains of a snivlet.
I should know better than to let him prepare a shipment.
Ah! Well, in that case let's have a look at the parts you packed yourself.
Yes!
this is so great! This is even better than the Andromeda.
and you know what, I think that this orange juice is real.
I bet they had to import it all the way from Rigel.
infinity, actually.
Wow! You look great.
Thanks.
you know I left some bubbles in the tub I should probably use them.
cute kid.
kinks all worked out? - Yeah. Not bad.
look I...I'm sorry I haven't had much time. Things have been really insane.
truth be told, you couldn't have come at a worse time. Speaking of which, why are you here?
I mean, not... not that I'm not happy to see you.
I told you why I'm here. I thought you were in trouble.
Oh yes! Well, I guess I've grown cynical in my old age.
it's just... the timing of your arrival is... is so surprising.
tell me about Ignatius. I...I'm really sorry that I missed his funeral.
you didn't miss much. "Eject cargo pod: Yes/No.
he deserved better.
you know my biggest regret? That he didn't live long enough to...share this with me.
he would've liked that. - Yeah.
he didn't...talk about me at the end, did he?
he was pretty sick. You know how it is...when they get like that.
did he leave any messages, anything?
you're fishing, Sid.
you know what, your father had some data that belonged to me.
he probably saved it on a disk or buried it in the Maru's database.
did he ever mention anything like that to you, ever?
not that I know of.
what kind of data was it?
Oh, nothing really, just...personal journals, visual records, that sort of thing.
Perhaps...you could look for it.
it would mean a lot to me.
and as a matter of fact, ...and I always intended to do this.
if you could help me, I...I might be able to return the favour.
in what way?
do you know what your dad always wanted, more than anything?
to leave you with an inheritance.
enough money so you could do anything you wanted.
well, he left me the Maru.
that's hardly what he wanted.
what do you say I make up the difference?
how about...
...well, how does ten million guilders sound to you?
ten million? - Ten million...
...I see your memory being jogged already.
if you find the files, I need them unopened.
Oh! In the meantime, you should have some fun.
unlimited credit, courtesy Trans-Galactic. Anything you want, it's on me.
a little to the left.
perfect.
I aim to please.
Magnificient.
I wish you would stop looking for beauty in things that want to kill us.
this storm has no intent. It simply is.
can we evade it?
if the neutrino damper is working properly, we should have an excellent margin for safety.
circuit overload.
I think we can safely say, the...damper's defective.
Dylan to command. The lizard stabbed us in the back.
you know, for a while there...
...I thought you were going to sit in the suite and sulk all night and live on bread and water...
okay, you're right. That's the best time I've had in a long time.
Awwww yes! To Unca Sid! - To Uncle Sid!
you know, Trance, what I could do with ten million guilders?
Oh, you could buy lots of drinks with umbrellas in them.
more like fix up the Maru.
pay off my debts... Debts? I could kick back, relax for a change.
so, why don't find that whatchamacallit Sid wants and give it to him?
see, that is the problem,...personal journals and video diaries are not worth that kind of money.
Sid is up to something. - You know...I think he's kinda sweet.
you know, you shouldn't drink. It impairs your judgement.
I'm still trying to figure out this whole poisoning yourself for fun thing. I think I like it.
come on, Trance. We have to check out the Maru.
Hey...exactly where on the body is the moneymaker located?
is this you? - Hmmm...when I was six.
you had red hair!
my dad thought having one hair colour was boring, so he designed these nanobots for me.
I can make my hair whatever colour I want.
Oh, can you do purple?
you should see plaid.
trance, go seal the airlock. - Why?
someone else has been through these files. - What?
seal the hatch. We're leaving.
ahh, don't be so hasty. You still owe me that kiss.
you want a kiss? Kiss this!
so, where were we, hm?
not on my time, Mick!
you should have just taken the money, Rebecca.
it would've made it a lot easier for the both of us.
I've had enough of this bull. I know why you came here.
I told you, to help you. My mistake.
you came answering a three-year old message...
...Two days before my takeover of Quantum. I don't think so.
now where are those files?
even if I knew what the hell you were talking about, which I don't,...
...why do you think I'd tell you now?
somebody's made you a better offer, haven't they?
who is it? Is it Quantum? Spacerunners?
I'm beginning to think your dad's friend is a criminal.
Oh please. It's her father who's the criminal.
you haven't told your friend here the story of your life?
well, it's rather sort of romantic in a pathetic sort of way.
you and your brother, raised like wolves, by a flash-fried drug runner.
that's not true. My father never used flash.
the trust of a child runs deep.
your father never used flash? Let me tell you something.
your father and I practically invented flash.
the lab rats still found nothing, boss. We'll need those codes.
you heard the man.
drop dead.
it's not my life that's on the line here, Rebecca.
Beka? Beka, are you all right?
what did they do to you? - Nothing.
I walked into a door.
well then please sit down.
good girl. Stay.
Oh Trance, I'm not really in the mood for a cocktail right now.
disinfectant.
so did you tell the door what it wanted to know?
I can't tell them anything. I don't know anything.
obviously my dad had something Sid wants very badly.
well, if your father was a drug runner, and Sid was his partner,...
...I would assume... - Get one thing straight.
my father was not a drug addict!
well, I never said that he was. I said he was a drug runner.
that's not the same thing... is it?
no, I guess not.
Slipfighter fuel cells charged. O2 is at 18 percent.
check, and check.
going someplace?
rev, I wish you wouldn't do that. Besides, you are...early.
confession's not supposed to come until after I commit the crime.
I never took you for a man who flees from the consequences of his decisions.
I'm not fleeing. I just have to run an errand.
wanna come? - Most definitely.
don't tell me... You've got a plan.
okay, I won't.
hmm, he always has a plan!
let me get this straight: You're not trying to blackmail me,...
...you don't know what's on the coded data and you've never seen it.
right, right, and right again. You pick this stuff up fast.
I wish I could believe you, Rebecca. I really do.
but you don't, so let's get on with the torture, is that it?
it doesn't have to be this way, Rebecca.
I pride myself on being able to make a deal with anyone, and I mean anyone.
now, I'm going to give you one more chance.
name your price, give me the data, and we'll just pretend this never happened.
I don't want...your money.
so that's it, huh?
my money isn't good enough for the daughter of Ignatius Valentine.
maybe you want something else. Is it revenge?
you blame me for what happened to your father.
should I?
you know, I think you think of him as some sort of hero, out there all alone,...
...fighting the corporate oppressor, coming home with tall tales and trinkets.
who do you think bought those trinkets?
your father was either hung over and forgot,...
...or some hooker rode him in port. Do you know what he used to call you?
blood of my blood.
try "my little ball and chain." - That's not true.
he used to tell me you were not worth the cost...of fuel.
well...
...you really are the daughter of Ignatius Valentine. More's the pity.
flash. It's the ultimate edge. You'll love it!
5 milligrams today, 5 milligrams tomorrow, and the next day, you will be selling your first born...
...for just one milligram more.
it's okay. I'm cool.
take this down,...and log a time and date because we might get out of here.
Sam Profit is going down! And he's going down so hard he's going to create another gravity well in this sector.
just let me at 'im. Just let me at 'im.
six feet, I can jump six feet. - Beka! What...?
flash!
I don't drink, did you know that?
I don't drink. I don't squirt, I don't snort, I don't inhale, I don't...!
I've been straight-edged all my life, all my life...
...because I'm my daddy's little girl, and I don't want to be like my daddy.
here I am, I'm streaking like a fleakin' comet.
you can't stop me.
you can't stop a Valentine with a head full of steam, believe me I know. I tried.
blood of my blood, Trance.
what if it's in my blood? What if I can't stop?!
okay, Beka please, just...try and slow down, all right?
inhale and exhale. Inhale, exhale...
don't TREAT ME LIKE A CHILD! I AM NOT A CHILD! YOU ARE!
or are you? How old are you, Trance?
I don't even know. I don't anything about you.
where you from?
who you're working for?
Why're you purple?
you workin' for Sid?
are you workin' for Sid? You're workin' for him, aren't you?
aren't you, Trance? Trance! Are you? Trance?!
Beka, stop it! Please Beka stop it!
no , no, I could do purple.
okay Beka, you're angry, and it's totally fine to be angry, but please be angry at him!
I know...I know...I know...I know.
trance. Trance, we have to get out of here.
I know where it is.
all right, come away. It's okay.
where is he?
I'm sorry, Captain Hunt has stepped away from his desk.
please leave a message after the tone from the funny little guy. Beep!
are you amused?
we have at best eight hours before that storm reduces us to component parts, and Dylan has disappeared.
I don't know. Ask Rev Bem, maybe he knows.
he's missing ,too!
try decaf.
back to normal? N'okay?
I will be.
robbed of my superpowers, I will have to rely on mere human ingenuity.
Oh, how are we going to get out of here?
let me think. Ummm...how about.this one?
Yeee-yeah!
sorry sweetie, the room don't come with a view.
Ohhh, I've been waitin' for this.
it's personalized to my own DNA...moron.
let's get them comm gear and let's get them out of here.
did I mention I'm not having fun yet?
nor I. Ship! I'm assuming command.
engage thrusters and take us out of here.
permission to come aboard, Captain Anasazi.
how often do you get the chance to get up close and personal with a class-seven solar storm?
it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, don't you agree?
you can't keep me here, I'm a highly respected businessman.
not on my ship, you're not. - You must understand,...
...I have to get back to the warehouse. My employees will steal me blind!
Oh, I do understand.
I understand that honesty and integrity were casualties of war,...
...and while I may not approve... for the record,...
I don't approve...right now, my bad day is your bad day.
enjoy the view.
welcome to our humble abode. - Keep that cannibal away from me!
uh, cannibal? No.
see, he doesn't eat his own kind. Chichin, however...
when their whining exceeds a certain... decibel level,...
...I find it very difficult to control my lower nature.
how much longer before the storm reaches its peak?
I wouldn't crack open any epic novels if I were you.
we might be able to hold together.
course, we'd be a lot safer if we had a working neutrino damper.
a damper?
you need a neutrino damper? What a coincidence,...
...I can get you a damper, a beautiful brand-new damper you will be proud to call your own.
you don't say...
this way.
I'm busy, Mick! - I know.
we've got a problem.
the blonde...tased me and the purple girl disabled the security grid.
they barricaded themselves in the room.
scuse me gentlemen.
listen to me, I want you to do exactly as I tell you...
trance, when did we leave the Andromeda?
how long've we been away? - I'd say this makes...five days,...
...but sometimes I lose count when I'm unconscious.
I was afraid of that. I told Dylan I'd be back by now.
probably thinks I ditched him. - Beka, I can hear them!
they're outside. Hurry up! - I just need one...more...minute.
I don't think we have another minute.
give it up girls, there's no way outta here.
wrong again. - Right! What?
hold your breath.
that was easy.
boss? Worked just like you said.
I'm wondering......if she's coming back.
what makes you say that?
well, you've spent the last three months helping her upgrade her ship.
you've armed it, you've rebuilt its engines and computers.
I think it's possible she may have taken advantage of your generosity and gone back for her own business.
because that's what you would do.
not after warning you.
so is this the point where he starts shooting at us?
well, I'm betting he won't kill us until he finds that data.
which we have?
okay, here's what I remember: "My dad and Sid were partners.
they built the Maru together.
they were always planning and scheming about getting rich.
until this one deal.
this was going to be the big score, the best deal ever.
and then, I don't know, it fizzled somehow.
dad and I went to Signa Gamma One to meet Sid,...
...and as soon as we got there, we just turned right around and...left.
no money, no cargo, no Sid.
as far as I know, that's the last time they saw each other.
autopilot engaged.
I'm betting whatever Sid's looking for has something to do with that trip.
well, he would've found the Eureka Maru's log by now, wouldn't he?
Yeah, if it was in the logs. - What are you doing?
remember when I told you that my dad made nanobots for my hair?
he did it as soon as we left Sig Gamma One.
Sid didn't even notice.
he hid his secret in your hair?
my dad may have been an addict, but he knew his nano-tech.
if I'm right, these little robots did a heck of a lot more than change my hair colour.
they recorded Sid's missing data on a molecular level.
zeros and ones, all adding up to this.
Signa Gamma One docking station.
Sid. Sid, are you there?
daddy.
they're dead.
they're all dead.
Ohhh Sid...
you think they'd just wave through a ten-ton shipment of flash?
Sid, what have you done??
I did what I had to do, as always.
you talk like a man... whose hands are clean.
I'm a thief. I'm a smuggler. I am not a murderer!
well you are now.
you're watching it, aren't you?
Sid. What did you do?
are you really never saw it? You really didn't? Heh.
paranoia. Kinda gets to you when you're in my line of work.
when you're a murderer?
Oh, it wasn't supposed to happen that way, Rebecca. Honestly.
somebody must've tipped off Signa customs.
you know the punishment for drug-smuggling on Signa Gamma One?
they chop you up for spare parts.
I had to protect myself, protect us both.
and then your father, he had the gall to blackmail me.
with the recording. - He was so pathetic.
he never asked for much, just a few guilders here and there,...
...a spare part or two, but there was always that recording hanging over my head.
and then,...
...then he fried himself on flash and I figured it was all over.
until I decided to buy my way into Trans-Galactic.
you were worried that I'd start using the tape against you.
I have always had a soft-spot for you, Rebecca.
and I figured that we could come to an arrangement.
that's when I sent you that message. But you never responded.
and then three years later, you show up on my doorstep?
what was I supposed to think? - You thought I'd ruin your deal.
you know, a ruined deal is one thing,...
...but to lose one's life... Sentiment only goes so far.
my feeling is, when it comes to destroying evidence,...
...nothing beats a sun. - Sun?
disengage autopilot!
authorization denied.
I helped build the Maru, remember?
little help here!
I'm sorry Rebecca, but I've had my fill of Valentines.
Incoming...
it's not gonna do you any good, you know. You're too late.
you think that was the only hair on my head?
back in the suite, I beamed the log to the Freelance Courier Co-op.
by now it's on its way to every law-enforcement agency in the quadrant:
open immediately upon my death." - You're bluffing.
you couldn't afford the courier fees. - I know, but you can.
unlimited credit, remember?
if anything happens to me, and I mean anything, you are front page news in three galaxies.
not bad kiddo. Not bad at all.
runs in the family. - All right, here's the deal:
I let you live, and you sit on that recording, and nobody ever sees it, because if it ever sees the light of day, I have nothing to lose.
your secret's safe.
as long as I'm alive. So you'd better wish me a long and healthy life.
why wouldn't I? After all, what are uncles for?
it's responding!
good! Get us outta here. - Okay.
Dylan, she is thirty-six hours late.
and I simply don't see why you should keep a bargain when she doesn't.
an incoming communication for you Dylan.
put it through.
this is the Eureka Maru, requesting permission to land, Captain Hunt sir.
affirmative, Eureka Maru. You're late.
Yeah, I know. - We know.
glad to have you back.
you know, whenever I think about my father, I picture him at the end. I try not to, but I still do. It was hard.
I have to just remember that those were just a few years in a long life.
when I was a kid, when he was young, he was the best, Trance.
he was smart, and funny, and tough. And brave.
he could make me laugh until my sides hurt.
no matter how dark things got, and no matter how long the odds, he always... always came up with a plan.
the right plan.
I wish you could've met him Trance.
Yeah, me too.
but you know, that's okay because... I know his daughter.
blood of his blood, Beka.
blood of his blood.
wealth is too Precious to be entrusted to the Rich.
anonymous Kalderan Proverb, circa [CY 500]
captain on deck!
I'll alert the media. - It means we're supposed to stand at pretension.
at ease Trance. I think it's a little late in the game to restore the military protocols.
I'm sorry, Dylan. Some of my systems have reverted to defaults.
excuse me.
after the number of scrapes she's been through, it's a wonder she's a-workin' at all.
don't worry, Rommie.
as soon as we dock at El Dorado Drift, we'll pick up parts and you'll be as good as new.
what he said. El D. She's got everything we need. Wine, wiring, and WOMEN.
all I care about is news, weather and sports. And that should be comin' in right about...now.
Yes! Civilization. - Mail call!
it's already here, courtesy of your friendly neighborhood space traveller's aid.
but...I don't know why you're so excited, it's always just bills for Beka,...or epistles from Rev Bem's spiritual pen pals. All you and I ever get is junk.
I know, and it is so great! Because you can buy your own moon......or you can make millions without ever leaving the comfort of your own homeworld!
...collection of CEO Sam Profit. - Oh here's breaking news,...
...Trans-Galactic is..."merging" with Quantum. Economists were taken by surprise.
get out of here! I own shares in Quantum.
you do? How many? - Three
well, don't count your dividends before they hatch. The Free Trade Alliance still has to give its approval.
please, the Free Trade Alliance never met a monopoly it didn't like.
I only have one question. What are we talking about?
analyzing.
Trans-Galactic Shipping and Quantum Express are two of the largest private cargo carriers in the sector.
their consolidation would...
would force small operators out of business by red-lining business and undercutting costs.
how is a little guy supposed to compete against someone like Sam Profit?
Trans-Galactic's "uber" big kahuna.
put him in a fish tank with piranhas... pray for the piranhas.
I'm sure that's all very interesting, but may we discuss the weather?
I didn't know you liked the weather.
I could tell you everything you ever wanted to know about cumulus clouds.
they form really high in the atmos...phere.
the only time the weather concerns me is when it threatens my health and well-being.
today, for instance.
a class-seven solar storm.
it's headed right for us. Looks like we better make those repairs quick.
I know. I know! More work for me.
Heya, boss? You know a guy named Sid Barry?
Yeah, he was my father's business partner. Why?
you got a message from him, marked...Extremely Urgent.
bring it up.
hello Rebecca. It's Sid, your Uncle Sid.
I hate to come to like this, but I need to see you.
there's an attached file with contact information.
I'm not going to beg you, Rebecca, but we both know your dad owes me one.
I guess I'm calling in my marker on the... the Valentine family huh?
I hope to see you soon.
sounds like he's in trouble.
I...hope it's not too serious. That message is over three years old.
the long night has come.
the Systems Commonwealth, the greatest civilization in history, has fallen.
but now, one ship, one crew, have vowed to drive back the night and rekindle the light of civilization.
on the starship Andromeda, hope lives again.
three years, Beka. You don't even know if he's still on Diphta Five.
I know, I know. - And the odds...
and the odds of finding him at all are like really really small.
you know, if you don't want me to go, why don't you just say so?
I don't want you to go.
damn. I didn't think you'd just say so.
we haven't got much time before the storm hits, and we need the Maru to carry supplies.
one of Andromeda's pods can handle it.
our pods aren't designed for moving cargo.
okay, they are, but...
...you speak Drift, and it's been a long time since I've bought anything.
blood of my blood, Dylan. That's what my father used to call me.
all my life, he never asked me for one thing.
now he's gone. And if I can pay back a debt for him,...
...I don't see how I have a choice.
solar storm hits in five days. Can you be back by then?
I better be.
can't trust you to fly us out of class seven storm.
we'll be here. Good luck.
autopilot engaged.
let me guess. Dylan asked you to keep an eye on me.
well, actually, Dylan wanted to send Rev Bem, but changed his mind 'cause of the strom.
...so nobody left, and I didn't want him to worry, I decided to sneak on board and here I am now.
are you mad at me? - Hm?
how can I be mad, Trance? I don't even know what you're talking about.
Oh.
don't worry, I'll look after her. Love, Trance.
so? - So now I'm worried.
they're both big girls. They can take care of themselves.
besides, we have plenty to worry about right here.
I say we prioritize the picotransducers, nanothrusters, and...an AP solenoid valve.
we can agree on the thrusters and the valve,...
...but we also need photon bombs, and we need to refit our pulse plasma guns and point defense lasers.
isn't this a lot of wishful thinking? How are we going to pay for all of this?
technically that would be the quartermaster's job.
we don't have a quartermaster.
are you saying we don't have any money?
Oh we have plenty of currency, it's just that none of it's...current.
okay, I can get most of this stuff, but we'll have to rig for a fast getaway.
Harper! - Harper, we're not going to steal anything.
thank you.
well, what would you suggest?
there's an old Earth custom, Tyr. It's called...a garage sale.
what's a garage?
Yuck! I hate planets. How could anyone live like this?
well, didn't your people evolve on a planet?
Yeah, the smart ones left, as soon as they got a chance.
brain dead flash fryers.
is that fun? - What fun?
squirting drugs into your eyeballs, because it seems like human beings enjoy poisoning themselves.
well, it's not really that simple Trance. Flash is a synaptic enhancer.
it makes you stronger, better, faster.
dad always said it made a great solution if you don't make it your...problem.
okay, so this is Avenida Nuevo Ciudad. This is supposed to be the place.
Ninety-four...ninety-two...ninety. Right there!
but...I think we're too late.
Sid's address but no Sid.
Ohhh great.
the light fixtures in the crew cabins can go.
sports equipment...stays.
we need weapons, not toys.
we need a crew that hasn't gone crazy from lack of recreation.
Oh, anyone who...touches my basketball hoop answers to me personally.
Oh oh, the drift trader that you're meeting is called Grask. Now he's a...Chichin.
Oh great. - Yes, they never buy what they can steal.
they're scum. They eat their own young.
I'll thank you to see that he comes nowhere near me.
Mmm...probably a good idea.
Yeah, make a note of that.
that's ceremonial china from the Than ambassador. - Really?
sounds like a spool of superconductor wire to me!
if I don't keep my eyes open, he'll probably sell the...
Rommie. Rommie. Would I...hurt you?
Hey, whoa!
where you goin' with all this good stuff?
that stays.
What'd I do?
personal effects of the crew.
Hey, I'm looking for a guy.
lucky you, you just found one.
a specific guy.
his name's Sid Barry. You ever seen him?
I not your type?
you know what they say, once you try bio-engineered, you never go back.
I think she's into older men.
what about you, sweetness, are you into older men?
or are you just into her?
watch the tail. - You know, grape's my favorite flavor.
Beka, are they cannibals?
C'mon baby, give me some sugar.
what the hell is that? - Sugar cane.
trance, your left! Other left!
you want him? The guy in the picture.
I know where you can find him.
Ohhh wow, this is amazing! That's real wood.
look at you, with your blond hair! I hardly recognized you.
what are you doing here?
I got an old message. I thought you needed help.
Oh.oh that.well...
...that's kind of complicated. - Mister Profit, line three.
profit? You work for Sam Profit?
Heh. Well, not exactly, I...
...I am Sam Profit.
this is it.
is this your room?
not at all my dear, it's your room. And yours too.
fit for a princess. Her daddy's little princess.
I still don't get it. How can you be Sam Profit?
you really had no idea?
the word shocked comes to mind. Amazed. Dumfounded.
so why'd you come all this way?
she came here to help you. - I came here to help Sid Barry.
remember him? - I'm still Sid.
not from where I'm standing.
when I was a kid,...
...you and my dad would stand around and complain about the big shipping companies.
now you're the one buying up the trade routes and forcing out people like us.
curse the big companies all you want, but big companies get things done.
and small operators don't?
you know, why don't I...walk around.
okay, this is me leaving.
it's all about moving things, kiddo. People, cargo.
the more things move, the more they connect, and the more they connect, the safer the universe gets.
and the richer you get.
money is not a disease. It's the cure.
let me ask you something: What was your father after his whole life?
redheads.
the big score. - Exactly!
and this is it!
he may not have admitted it, but this is what he was after.
this is what he wanted. What we wanted.
but you know what, enough about me.
is there anything you want?
chocolate!
I don't know. This is not what I was expecting.
hold that thought.
mister Profit, time for your Quantum run.
well, Quantum waits for no man. I've got to get back to the office.
by the way, you look a little tense. I hear Rutger has great hands.
Oh yeah?
what's so great about them?
trance... do not let him buy you off with a back rub.
this is Sam Profit we're dealing with.
I think you're just...cranky from the gravity.
why don't you just think of this as a way to... decreasing his corporate resources.
now, let's start with the tail.
is this receptacle hemititer or lixx?
I...think it's black plastic.
Oh. Too bad. It might have had value.
This...microsensor might have had value too if you... hadn't removed the fuel cell.
removed? No, not removed! Never removed.
Leeshka! My apprentice. Has the brains of a snivlet.
I should know better than to let him prepare a shipment.
Ah! Well, in that case let's have a look at the parts you packed yourself.
Yes!
this is so great! This is even better than the Andromeda.
and you know what, I think that this orange juice is real.
I bet they had to import it all the way from Rigel.
infinity, actually.
Wow! You look great.
Thanks.
you know I left some bubbles in the tub I should probably use them.
cute kid.
kinks all worked out? - Yeah. Not bad.
look I...I'm sorry I haven't had much time. Things have been really insane.
truth be told, you couldn't have come at a worse time. Speaking of which, why are you here?
I mean, not... not that I'm not happy to see you.
I told you why I'm here. I thought you were in trouble.
Oh yes! Well, I guess I've grown cynical in my old age.
it's just... the timing of your arrival is... is so surprising.
tell me about Ignatius. I...I'm really sorry that I missed his funeral.
you didn't miss much. "Eject cargo pod: Yes/No.
he deserved better.
you know my biggest regret? That he didn't live long enough to...share this with me.
he would've liked that. - Yeah.
he didn't...talk about me at the end, did he?
he was pretty sick. You know how it is...when they get like that.
did he leave any messages, anything?
you're fishing, Sid.
you know what, your father had some data that belonged to me.
he probably saved it on a disk or buried it in the Maru's database.
did he ever mention anything like that to you, ever?
not that I know of.
what kind of data was it?
Oh, nothing really, just...personal journals, visual records, that sort of thing.
Perhaps...you could look for it.
it would mean a lot to me.
and as a matter of fact, ...and I always intended to do this.
if you could help me, I...I might be able to return the favour.
in what way?
do you know what your dad always wanted, more than anything?
to leave you with an inheritance.
enough money so you could do anything you wanted.
well, he left me the Maru.
that's hardly what he wanted.
what do you say I make up the difference?
how about...
...well, how does ten million guilders sound to you?
ten million? - Ten million...
...I see your memory being jogged already.
if you find the files, I need them unopened.
Oh! In the meantime, you should have some fun.
unlimited credit, courtesy Trans-Galactic. Anything you want, it's on me.
a little to the left.
perfect.
I aim to please.
Magnificient.
I wish you would stop looking for beauty in things that want to kill us.
this storm has no intent. It simply is.
can we evade it?
if the neutrino damper is working properly, we should have an excellent margin for safety.
circuit overload.
I think we can safely say, the...damper's defective.
Dylan to command. The lizard stabbed us in the back.
you know, for a while there...
...I thought you were going to sit in the suite and sulk all night and live on bread and water...
okay, you're right. That's the best time I've had in a long time.
Awwww yes! To Unca Sid! - To Uncle Sid!
you know, Trance, what I could do with ten million guilders?
Oh, you could buy lots of drinks with umbrellas in them.
more like fix up the Maru.
pay off my debts... Debts? I could kick back, relax for a change.
so, why don't find that whatchamacallit Sid wants and give it to him?
see, that is the problem,...personal journals and video diaries are not worth that kind of money.
Sid is up to something. - You know...I think he's kinda sweet.
you know, you shouldn't drink. It impairs your judgement.
I'm still trying to figure out this whole poisoning yourself for fun thing. I think I like it.
come on, Trance. We have to check out the Maru.
Hey...exactly where on the body is the moneymaker located?
is this you? - Hmmm...when I was six.
you had red hair!
my dad thought having one hair colour was boring, so he designed these nanobots for me.
I can make my hair whatever colour I want.
Oh, can you do purple?
you should see plaid.
trance, go seal the airlock. - Why?
someone else has been through these files. - What?
seal the hatch. We're leaving.
ahh, don't be so hasty. You still owe me that kiss.
you want a kiss? Kiss this!
so, where were we, hm?
not on my time, Mick!
you should have just taken the money, Rebecca.
it would've made it a lot easier for the both of us.
I've had enough of this bull. I know why you came here.
I told you, to help you. My mistake.
you came answering a three-year old message...
...Two days before my takeover of Quantum. I don't think so.
now where are those files?
even if I knew what the hell you were talking about, which I don't,...
...why do you think I'd tell you now?
somebody's made you a better offer, haven't they?
who is it? Is it Quantum? Spacerunners?
I'm beginning to think your dad's friend is a criminal.
Oh please. It's her father who's the criminal.
you haven't told your friend here the story of your life?
well, it's rather sort of romantic in a pathetic sort of way.
you and your brother, raised like wolves, by a flash-fried drug runner.
that's not true. My father never used flash.
the trust of a child runs deep.
your father never used flash? Let me tell you something.
your father and I practically invented flash.
the lab rats still found nothing, boss. We'll need those codes.
you heard the man.
drop dead.
it's not my life that's on the line here, Rebecca.
Beka? Beka, are you all right?
what did they do to you? - Nothing.
I walked into a door.
well then please sit down.
good girl. Stay.
Oh Trance, I'm not really in the mood for a cocktail right now.
disinfectant.
so did you tell the door what it wanted to know?
I can't tell them anything. I don't know anything.
obviously my dad had something Sid wants very badly.
well, if your father was a drug runner, and Sid was his partner,...
...I would assume... - Get one thing straight.
my father was not a drug addict!
well, I never said that he was. I said he was a drug runner.
that's not the same thing... is it?
no, I guess not.
Slipfighter fuel cells charged. O2 is at 18 percent.
check, and check.
going someplace?
rev, I wish you wouldn't do that. Besides, you are...early.
confession's not supposed to come until after I commit the crime.
I never took you for a man who flees from the consequences of his decisions.
I'm not fleeing. I just have to run an errand.
wanna come? - Most definitely.
don't tell me... You've got a plan.
okay, I won't.
hmm, he always has a plan!
let me get this straight: You're not trying to blackmail me,...
...you don't know what's on the coded data and you've never seen it.
right, right, and right again. You pick this stuff up fast.
I wish I could believe you, Rebecca. I really do.
but you don't, so let's get on with the torture, is that it?
it doesn't have to be this way, Rebecca.
I pride myself on being able to make a deal with anyone, and I mean anyone.
now, I'm going to give you one more chance.
name your price, give me the data, and we'll just pretend this never happened.
I don't want...your money.
so that's it, huh?
my money isn't good enough for the daughter of Ignatius Valentine.
maybe you want something else. Is it revenge?
you blame me for what happened to your father.
should I?
you know, I think you think of him as some sort of hero, out there all alone,...
...fighting the corporate oppressor, coming home with tall tales and trinkets.
who do you think bought those trinkets?
your father was either hung over and forgot,...
...or some hooker rode him in port. Do you know what he used to call you?
blood of my blood.
try "my little ball and chain." - That's not true.
he used to tell me you were not worth the cost...of fuel.
well...
...you really are the daughter of Ignatius Valentine. More's the pity.
flash. It's the ultimate edge. You'll love it!
5 milligrams today, 5 milligrams tomorrow, and the next day, you will be selling your first born...
