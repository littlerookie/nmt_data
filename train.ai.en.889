after all, I'm the guy that gave you and Pretty Boy the hookup.
am I a guardian or am I a guardian?
you're more than that, Mushu.
you're my most trusted friend.
that did it.
are you crying again?
no, I just got some exfoliating cream in my eye.
of course I'm crying, girl. What you think?
Oh, Mulan. I'm just so happy for me.
you?
this wedding business is a big status boost for me.
when those ancestors look up the career ladder, all they gonna see is my behind.
so glad my getting married is helping you out, Mushu.
all right, I get you, Miss Missy.
but, you know, I'm thinking about you too.
in fact, I'm gonna plan your wedding.
first, I gotta work me up a theme. You know, theme is everything.
how about Rainbow of Memories?
no, that's too junior prom.
I've got it. The theme is Thick Pink.
you know, pink is the new red, girl. It's simple, it says it.
now, watch my smoke.
Cri-Kee, to the fabric store.
Mulan?
seems your grandma invited someone to help us celebrate the engagement.
Really? Who?
china.
Congratulations!
isn't it wonderful?
sorry, it's sort of slapdash.
it took us by surprise, you know?
make way for the happy couple.
now, this is a battlefield.
what's our strategy, General?
divide and conquer.
all right, all right, all right, dead people, we've got work to do, so let's move with purpose.
I've got an important announcement to make.
hold on to your ectoplasm, now. Mulan's getting married!
all right, all right, all right, simmer down. I know just how you feel.
but time is wasting, people, so let's move, move, move.
the theme is pink.
I wanna see pink flowers, pink ribbons, pink bows.
I'm not talking about salmon. Don't show me no blush.
I mean, pink as a freshly slapped newborn's behind.
how about a pink slip? - Excuse me?
don't nobody wanna see your drawers.
actually, she meant this.
Hey, this looks like a for-real pink slip.
you know, like a "you're fired" pink slip.
it is. - Say what?
the pink slip is for you.
it is written, once a woman marries, her husband's ancestors take over the duty of guardianship.
Oh, no, your scroll must have a typo. That can't be.
but it is. You're out of a job. - Out of a pedestal.
and out of our hair, fool.
Oh, no, no, no. I ain't going out like this.
it took me 500 years to get this pedestal back, and I ain't about to give it up.
hear me, you lazy lounge lizard.
the moment Fa Mulan is married, you've got your old job back.
remember gong duty?
perhaps this will ring a bell.
Mushu's on his way out!
Mushu's on his way out! Mushu's on his way out!
what am I gonna do?
Mushu's on his way out!
so tell me, will it be a big wedding? - Absolutely.
Oh, no. Absolutely not.
children? - As many as possible.
maybe one or two.
we'll think about it. - Right away.
blue Mild. - Pink Spicy.
Yes. - No.
Oh, dear. Did you hear that?
not exactly a harmonious couple, are they?
what should we do?
perhaps we should give our gift to the children now.
general Shang, Fa Mulan. Orders from His Majesty the Emperor.
is there trouble? - Yes, sir.
report to the Imperial Palace.
we'll leave at once.
this must be pretty important for the Emperor to want both of us.
he knows a winning team when he sees one.
since when are they the winning team?
the ink ain't even dry on my pink slip and I'm being replaced.
Yeah, I know, you're right.
how could I have been so selfish?
look at them. Those two clearly got it going on.
Cri-Kee, I've made a decision.
I gotta kiss my pedestal goodbye, because my girl's happiness comes first.
Ba-ba. Ma-ma.
we were just admiring the Mudan tree.
it's so lovely this year.
the blossoms reach for the sunlight above, yet unseen, the roots reach for the rainwater below.
sun and rain, so different.
yet only by working together do they create harmony and life.
I know, Ba-ba. The lesson of yin and yang.
and to help you remember that lesson...
father, Mother. Your necklaces.
not ours. Our great great grandparents.
and now, yours.
thank you, sir.
they're so beautiful.
but you'll be surprised how heavily they can weigh.
to share the burden, you must work together.
like the sun and rain.
wait a minute.
old man Fa Zhou got a point now.
Mulan and Shang are as different as sun and rain.
and when the infatuation wears off, their tree of life's gonna wind up with root rot.
Yeah, sure she seems happy. That's the real tragedy here.
the girl don't even realize how miserable she is.
that's why I gotta nip this thing in the bud.
this is not about my pedestal.
this is about Mulan making the biggest mistake of my...
I mean, her life.
man, how could I have been so selfish?
Mulan's a girl worth fighting for.
and after all, I am the girl's guardian.
Cri-Kee, I'm gonna break them up.
so I guess that means you're on board.
Mulan, could you smooth out the ride a little bit?
I'm getting horsesick.
Mushu. What are you doing here?
Hey, whither thou go, I goest, girl.
remember, teamwork isn't about ego, it's about we go.
Cri-Kee. What are you doing here?
protect Mulan from me? I'm her guardian.
Yeah, yeah, her lucky cricket.
you're lucky I don't break out the bug spray.
as we stand here,
mongol forces are moving closer to our border.
the threat of attack is growing every day.
as it is, our army is hopelessly outnumbered.
your Majesty, let me lead my forces in a preemptive strike.
each of my warriors will fight like 10 Mongols.
no, General.
I plan to defeat this enemy without the use of force.
instead, we will forge a union so strong, the Mongol hordes won't dare attack.
an alliance with the kingdom of Qui Gong.
we will become united through marriage.
you will escort three princesses to Qui Gong.
there, they will marry Lord Chin's sons...
what? - And seal this critical alliance.
Yes, Your Majesty.
my advisors tell me the charts are clear.
if this wedding does not take place in three days, the alliance will crumble and the Mongols will destroy us.
mark my words, General, three days.
not a moment more, Your Majesty.
I know that face, Fa Mulan. What troubles you?
your Majesty, an arranged marriage?
rest assured, child, my daughters know exactly what they are doing.
your daughters?
they consider it an honor to marry in the cause of peace.
your Majesty, I...
apology accepted.
general, how many troops do you estimate you will need to accomplish this mission?
three. - Three companies?
three men. - You surprise me, General.
these are my children.
this mission does not call for force, but finesse.
we must become one with the countryside.
as Emperor, I trust you.
as a father,
I implore you to choose your three soldiers wisely.
I know just the men. Fearless.
loyal. - And disciplined.
china's most honorable and noble soldiers.
and stay out!
I've found wives for hundreds of men.
but the Golden Dragon of Unity himself couldn't make love matches for you three.
come back when you get personalities.
well, that's a fine way to treat China's greatest...
heroes.
what's her problem?
all I asked for was a girl who would worship the dirt I walk on.
I simply asked for someone who would cook for me morning, noon and night.
and I just wanted a girl who likes to laugh.
and thinks I'm a God.
perhaps we weren't specific enough.
forget that dragon lady.
the only ones who can find girls worthy of us is us.
Yeah.
# Well, l don't need her To be all smug and snooty #
# I got a plaque right here That says I kicked Hun booty #
# We have everything We dreamed we'd find #
# When we came back from war #
# Yeah, everything but #
# A girl worth fighting for #
# Hey, suck in your gut. #
# There's a girl worth fighting for #
# And I think she wants us to come over. #
# My girl will laugh at all my jokes #
# But tell it to me straight #
# She'll rub my head when I get sick #
# And let me pick off of her plate #
# If Ling can find a girl Who likes his chopstick nose trick #
# Oh, he really better just propose quick #
# Well, l have to say Based on today I'm cranky #
# I'll just spend my life with you two #
# Pass the hanky #
# And there's no one there to steal my chair #
# And twirl around the floor #
# Wish that I had A girl worth fighting for #
# I would be true To a girl worth fighting #
# I'd make fondue For a girl worth fighting #
# I'd even kiss you For a girl worth fighting #
# For #
Mulan. General Shang.
if you three aren't too busy disturbing the peace,
I need you to join Mulan and me on a mission.
to save China? - Naturally.
I'll be leaving behind a few broken hearts, but count me in.
sign me up. - When do we start, General?
tonight.
we're about to depart, Your Highnesses.
you have my word we will arrive swiftly and safely.
my sisters and I thank you, General Shang.
permit me to introduce Fa Mulan.
it is a privilege to meet the hero of China.
I leave you in her capable hands.
stand ready.
you might need these. It's a little chilly. - Thank you, Fa Mulan.
you're welcome, Your Highness.
so, you're getting married? - Oh, yes.
to princes in Qui Gong. - That's right.
well, they must be handsome.
we don't know. We've never met them.
Really?
so you have no idea what they're like at all.
it's all right, Fa Mulan.
it's our honor to serve the Emperor.
and the Middle Kingdom.
the whole thing is so exciting.
we're very happy, really.
well, I'm glad to hear that. I'm not sure I could go through with some...
Mulan, prepare to move out.
time to get going.
move out.
if we get to the Honshu pass by midday tomorrow...
we'll have just enough time to make it to Qui Gong.
Yeah, just enough time to stop Mulan from making the biggest mistake of my...
I mean, her life.
what's the face?
what face? - That face.
there's no face. This is my face, that's all.
you know I know you better than that, Mulan.
what's wrong?
I realize our duty is to the mission... - But...
but I have another duty. To my heart.
Mulan, your only duty is to the Emperor.
but, Shang, an arranged marriage?
I know, but not everyone can be as lucky as we are.
in an ideal world, everyone would marry for love.
but the world isn't perfect.
I'm just glad my world is.
"my world." Talk about selfish.
you know, you don't hear me bragging about how it's my world, even though it pretty much is.
I'm telling you, Cri-Kee, the sooner I bust them apart, the better things will be for Mulan.
and so I said, you just broke my best set of china.
china. Get it?
did you see the way she looked at me?
you mean with disgust?
no.
our eyes met and we shared a cosmic moment.
just like when I look at potted pig's knuckles.
it's love, I tell you.
love.
love, shmove.
it doesn't matter, we're on a mission.
no fraternizing with the princesses.
Engaged-to-be-married princesses.
Oh, yeah.
china is so big. Isn't it beautiful, Mei?
Mei?
Yes, beautiful.
did you see the way he looked at me?
who, the gorilla with the bad eye?
gorilla? He's more like a big cuddly panda bear.
but you didn't even talk to him. - A true romantic can tell.
he may be coarse on the outside, but on the inside...
he's gross? - I mean, under that.
he smells?
I can see past my nose.
deep down, deep, deep down, way down, there's something.
ting Ting, I think she's in love.
Oh, no. There will be none of that.
remember, Mei, you are to be married in three days.
you gave your solemn oath.
you're right.
we're stopping to water the horses, Your Highnesses.
maybe you'd like to stretch your legs?
are the guard fellows out there?
Yes. You're perfectly safe.
I think a leg stretch would be very nice.
thank you for helping me with my slipper.
may I know your name?
now. Dow. Cow. Bao?
no, you must eat.
it must be exhausting guarding us day and night.
Oh, no. Well, yes, but I'm strong, and marching.
Yes, I suppose all that training does make it second nature.
but I think, you, a princess, with royal...
I could never...
but it is our duty, and our honor.
although it can be a burden.
I've said too much.
you are very easy to talk to, Yao.
permit me to echo your praise, Your Highness.
I find your presence engaging and your conversation sparkling.
thank you.
well, hello there. I am Ling.
I am Princess Ting Ting.
well, if you ever need me, just give me a ting-a-ling.
come on, Your Highness.
you don't wanna let your guard down.
get it? Guard? Down?
thank you.
you know, I've got some blue blood myself.
many have called me a royal pain.
thank you.
you've been a great crowd.
ting Ting, look, isn't this fruit lovely?
chien-po got it for me. He's so sweet.
just get your pomegranates in the carriage.
fa Mulan?
your Highness. Is anything wrong?
no, no, not at all.
are you sure?
I just wanted to compliment you.
you were so brave to take your father's place in the army.
well, thank you.
your duty was to stay home, but your heart told you to break the rules.
how did you decide between duty and heart?
well, it wasn't easy.
but, by following my feelings, I wound up doing the right thing.
I guess I learned that my duty is to my heart.
my duty is to my heart.
Yes, that makes sense. That's marvelous.
thank you, Fa Mulan. Thank you.
you're welcome, I guess.
let's get back on the road.
that's my cue to put Operation Shang into action.
pretty Boy's gonna look so bad, it will send Mulan running for the hills.
this is gonna be delicious.
watch this.
Hey. What?
Hey.
good catch, Shang.
Shang?
Hey.
tasty.
I try and I try.
I put my heart and soul into busting them up.
and what do I have to show for it?
a cricket laughs in my face.
I just can't do it anymore.
great ancestors, I throw myself at your mercy.
my pedestal is all but a distant memory.
great Spirits, take me now.
hold on, ladies.
help! We'll save you.
look out, a cliff!
they're headed for the cliff.
come on.
time to go, ladies. - Ting Ting, over here.
go.
you're next. - No, no, no.
Alley-oop. - Take my arm.
Ling. - Ting Ting's stuck.
Mulan, the rope.
hang on.
is everyone all right? - Mei, I'll save you.
I saved the food.
and I saved you.
Mulan.
what happened? - I don't know, I wasn't near the carriage.
yao, Ling. Save the supplies.
keep paddling. Look how great you're doing.
who's the big boy? - Thank you.
my fault?
this wasn't my plan.
wagon's busted, cold and miserable, everything's ruined.
or maybe not.
old Shang's steaming like a fresh pork bun.
I bet he and Mulan are two nasty words away from an all-out feud.
Oh, Cri-Kee, things are brightening up after all.
I've seen happier princesses. - That's the least of our problems.
there's a mountain pass between here and Qui Gong.
it takes us through bandit country, but it's the only way.
why not just follow the river?
because the river is not on the map. - It's bound to go past a town.
and where there's a town, there's a road.
there's no town on the map.
well, then maybe we should just forget the map and wing it.
we can't "wing it." We need a new plan.
we have three days. What if we get lost?
then we pull over and ask directions.
we don't need to pull over and ask directions. We have a map.
what is it with men and asking directions?
what is it with women and maps?
you're saying women can't read maps?
I'm saying that women will ask directions, but they won't follow directions.
men follow directions, so they don't need...
general, I...
am I interrupting?
what is it, Yao? - Scout report.
I've found a village and a path to it through the forest.
a forest path?
great. Show us.
see? If it were a snake, it would have bit you.
there's bound to be a road down there that will lead us to Qui Gong.
good work, Yao. - Thank you, sir.
Shang, I'm sorry.
you're in charge of the mission.
no, I'm the one who's sorry.
a good leader is open to new ideas.
forgive me?
there's nothing to forgive.
I'd better go. I've got the first watch, General.
but...
are you bugging? Look at her go.
she can't wait to get away from him.
that's no smile, that's a mask of pain.
Yeah, well, that was just phase one of my new 18-phase master plan.
now, just watch phase two when I get up close and personal.
excuse me, Your Highness, I found your fan.
it just needed a little drying out.
thank you, Ling.
normally, I would say I'm your biggest fan, but, I'll just go away now.
again.
sorry.
I'll replace that.
of course she doesn't like you. You're just such a ding-a-ling.
he likes you.
it would seem so.
and you like him.
well, I appreciate that he's a good soldier.
how can you do that?
how can you look right at someone, realize you share a special connection, and then just...
I know where my duty lies, Mei.
do you?
and so, my dear father, I cannot complete this mission.
I have come to realize that my duty is to my heart.
what are you doing?
she's running away. - Mei, what are you thinking?
I can't complete this mission.
I know that now.
why, because Yao has given you his heart?
no, it's not about his heart.
it's about mine.
Mei, we've discussed this.
a princess must make every sacrifice for her country.
it's our duty.

she defied you.
she insulted you.
man, she laughed at your map. - My map.
and if she's laughing to your face, imagine what she's saying behind your back.
back.
she's a loose cannon.
she's out of control. - She's out of control.
I mean, who's in charge here? You?
I'm in charge, I'm in charge. - Or Mulan? Mulan.
Mulan. - Mulan.
Mulan!
general Shang? That's not it.
general Shang?
Hello, it's me, Mulan.
general Shang.
Shang, Shang, Shang.
I got it.
general Shang?
general Hardhead, that's what they should call him.
everything's got to have a strategy. - Mulan?
the man won't brush his teeth without a backup plan.
what? - I blame myself.
I fell for those broad shoulders.
I didn't realize there wasn't much sitting on top of them.
except for that garlic breath.
that boy can peel paint.
that's enough. Where is she?
I am good.
Mulan. - Why, hello, General.
out on night maneuvers?
general Hardhead? Brushing my teeth?
is something wrong? - I heard you, Mulan. Every word.
every word of what?
don't play coy. I saw you outside my tent.
what? I haven't left my post.
and I suppose you weren't gossiping about me with the princesses?
Shang, did that dip in the river get you waterlogged?
and why are you talking with your hand over your mouth?
I wouldn't want to peel your paint.
changing of the guard.
and next time, don't leave your post.
what's with him?
what's with her?
who am I talking to?
how could he not believe me?
I don't know, girlfriend.
but I do know this. Without trust, there can be no relationship.
and that man don't trust you.
maybe he was just confused.
please. First, you fussed about the arranged marriage.
then you fought about which way to Qui Gong.
now, you all feuding over nothing. It seems pretty clear to me.
you're right.
Mushu, I don't know what to do. - I do. It's simple.
drop that boy like a hot pot sticker. Kick him to the curb.
burn his letters and dance around the fire yelling, "Happy days are here again."
you know, you have a point.
if this is the real Li Shang, I don't like what I'm seeing.
I hope the tea is still warm.
after you. - No, after you.
no, after you. - After you.
I said, after you.
you, I'm gonna...
yao.
is everything all right?
no.
I mean, yes.
you see, Chien Po here has always had a dream.
a dream? - A dream?
a dream. - But I don't...
that dream.
a dream of seeing a small village in the middle of nowhere by the moonlight.
how can we help?
well, if Your Highnesses would consent to come with us to the village, we could still guard you, and Chien Po could have his dream.
my one chance to be like other guys.
can we? Can we? - Can we, please?
please, come on. - Ting Ting, please.
sounds like fun.
Hurray! Hurray!
we're sorry.
we're off.
I never noticed we were so different.
it's like I don't even know him.
well, what do you know about that?
I mean, I know he's by the book, but doesn't the man ever bend a rule?
and speaking of bending rules...
you know, relationships are easy when everything runs nice and smooth.
but... - Mulan.
nice and smooth just ran out of camp. - What?
did you know that almonds, rice and milk are part of a complete breakfast?
Mushu.
I'm just trying to tell you the princesses went AWOL, that's all.
where are the guards? - Showing them the way.
they're together?
together together? - Don't you understand Chinese?
Hey, what about old Shang hai?
I think I better handle this one on my own.
Shang's on a short fuse as it is.
just make sure nothing wakes him up.
you can count on me.
where are the guards?
the princesses.
my duty is to my heart"?
Mulan.
get your ticket, Cricket.
the show's about to begin.
look at all the food.
we just got in some excellent ginger.
ginger.
that goes very well with dumplings.
did you say dumplings?
how about some fresh ginseng?
that makes a wonderful accompaniment to soy beans.
one order of soy beans.
he's done. - You're done.
Oh, my.
who will be next to challenge the undefeated Shi Rongkai?
step aside. - Yao.
Oh, no. - You'll be killed, little man.
so where does he go?
yao, you're my hero.
little, like a little gorilla.
pick a prize, any prize.
which one do you want, sir?
give me that one.
okay, okay.
okay, okay, how about this one?
what does Attila say when he walks through the door?
hun, I'm home.
I give up.
I guess I'm not as funny as I think.
what a cute laugh. - Oh, no. I hate my laugh.
what? It's adorable.
I thought you didn't have a sense of humor.
no sense of humor?
it's so beautiful.
Yeah.
it's the same moon we see from the palace.
no, this one is entirely different.
you're right.
I know I've never seen anything like it.
Mulan.
I'm listening. - We...
that is... - All of us...
Oh, boy. - Fa Mulan, it's love.
yao and myself, Chien Po and Su...
and myself and Lingy Bear.
I mean, Ling.
group hug.
I'm so happy for all of you.
general Shang.
general Shang. - Oh, boy.
excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
don't worry. I'll handle this.
I'm so sorry to break up your little party.
this is gonna be good.
Shang, before you jump to conclusions, let me explain the situation.
fine. Why don't we start with this?
that's mine. - All yours?
or did you have help?
and so, my dear father, I cannot complete this mission.
I have come to realize that my duty is to my heart.
now, who does that sound like? - Mei never meant to send that letter.
your Highnesses, you swore a vow to be married in Qui Gong.
if your father saw you now breaking that vow, what would he say?
you three are to escort Their Highnesses back to their tents immediately.
you are to guard them. You are not to enter their tents.
you are not to speak to them.
not a word, ever. Am I understood?
Yes, sir.
Shang, the problem isn't as bad as it seems.
the problem, Mulan, is you. - What?
you place your own feelings above everything.
duty, obligation, tradition, it all means nothing to you.
it means everything to me.
my heart tells me my duty, and I follow it.
you're a brilliant warrior, Shang.
you're brave, you're loyal, but you don't trust your heart.
sometimes I wonder if you even have one.
this assignment has made it clear.
we are very different people.
maybe too different.
fine.
we have a mission to complete.
fine.
isn't it a great day?
I see Pretty Boy isn't talking to you.
and you're not talking to Pretty Boy.
well, you know you can always talk to me.
well, just wait till she realizes what I've done for her.
will that frown turn upside down.
Snapdragon?
just for that, I'm not talking to you.
we're so sorry for what we've done, Fa Mulan.
you inspired us to follow our hearts.
and we repay you by ruining your relationship.
no, you just opened my eyes to how broken it was.
I'm indebted to you, Mei.
keep a sharp eye. This is bandit country.
I sure wish we could talk to the princesses, Yao.
what? You know we can't.
Yes, Ling, I also wish we could talk to them.
but as you know, orders is orders.
Yes, but if I could talk to them, do you know what I would say?
no, Ling. What would you say if only you could?
I'd tell Ting Ting that she's the prettiest, funniest, most extraordinary girl I've ever met.
I would tell Princess Su that she is like fresh ginger on the rice bowl of my life.
and I would tell Mei that she's one right babe.
Mulan, what do you say to a little pick-me-up?
my father said differences can make you stronger.
he didn't realize that Shang and I are just too different.
well, you know you always got me.
the old team, right?
you're always looking out for me, Mushu.
well, just doing the best I can.
really, I just don't know what I'd do without you.
you're the best friend I've ever had.
I can't stand it no more.
the only thing wrong with you and Shang is me.
I'm the one that got between you.
what are you talking about?
it's not like you made the carriage go into the river.
now, that was an accident.
following several attempts at on purpose.
and it wasn't you outside Shang's tent.
you know how I gab.
and you woke him up after I left?
it wasn't easy neither. That man can sleep.
Mushu, what did you do? - Well, I was banging pots and pans.
no. What did you do?
you was getting married. Everything was gonna change.
I was gonna lose you. And my pedestal.
you mean, you got between Shang and me so you could keep your job?
I'm sorry.
what you did was unforgivable.
but you and Shang are so different.
wait a second. Not as different as I thought.
all those problems, they weren't us. They were you.
I've got to talk to Shang, tell him I love him.
Mulan, I'll make it up to you. I promise.
forget it. You've helped enough.
Shang. Shang.
it's an ambush. - Bandits.
close ranks. Save the princesses.
run, run. - You two, get the gold.
come on. - You two, come with me.
I got them.
Shang, I've got your back.
take my hand.
help! - The princesses.
how dare you touch me? - It won't budge.
then take the whole package. - No.
get your hands off her.
help!
No! - Mei.
Yao!
hold them off. Let's go.
help me.
run.
Mei. - Yao.
come on.
let's get out of here.
Shang, hang on.
it won't hold us both. - It will. It will, Shang.
Mulan.
I'm sorry. - Please.
Shang.
Shang!
Shang.
fa Mulan, we're ready to go through with the wedding.
no.
your orders are to take care of each other.
but...
losing Shang will not be meaningless.
no matter what it takes, I'm finishing this mission.
good horse.
what do you mean, they are gone?
there was an accident.
the royal carriage fell into the river and was destroyed.
a grave loss.
but it does not alter my agreement with the Emperor.
and unless it is honored,
I will sanction no alliance with the Middle Kingdom.
a marriage was promised. - And a marriage there will be.
I would be honored to wed a prince of Qui Gong.
you?
my Lord, Fa Mulan, the hero of China.
a jewel in your crown far more dear than three mere princesses.
this is not what was agreed.
however, the Golden Dragon of Unity smiles upon you today.
and in view of the tragedy, I will accept your offer.
you will make a fine bride for my eldest son, Prince Jeeki.
this is her?
she's so old.
Mulan said she was gonna finish the mission no matter what.
but how can she without us?
by taking your place.
Shang's alive.
Shang, you're alive. You're alive.
Mulan was right.
no one should marry someone they don't love.
I'm going to Qui Gong.
we're going with you. - No, you're not. Stay here.
would you say that was an order?
I would say it was a friendly suggestion.
let's go.
looks like we won't be a team after all, Mushu.
Mulan.
I would give up 1, 000 pedestals if I could stop this.
I doubt even the Golden Dragon of Unity could stop this now.
goodbye, Mushu.
my people, the Golden Dragon of Unity, who guides us in all we do, today sanctifies a union that will be a blessing for all of Qui Gong.
of course I wanna stop it.
but what can one itty-bitty dragon do?
with the tying of this sash, we shall unite not only two lives, but two kingdoms.
it's General Li Shang. - He's alive.
Yeah, Shang to the rescue.
lucky for Lord Chin, because I was about to whip his butt.
you're alive.
I couldn't let you get married without me.
general, this is outrageous.
you will leave at once. - I'm not going anywhere.
what are you doing? - I don't know. I'm winging it.
how dare you trample upon this sacred ceremony?
Oh, my gosh, he's gonna lower the hammer on Shang.
where is the dang Dragon of Unity when you need him?
don't bother me now, Cri-Kee, I...
I have an idea.
my lord, I love Mulan, and I don't care what the rules say.
if she'll have me, I intend to marry her right here, right now.
insolent dog.
seize him.
Shang. - Mulan.
yo, what's with all this drama?
the Golden Dragon of Unity. He lives.
Mushu?
you dang right, I live.
so you best drop your dumpling-eating behind on down and tell me why we ain't busting out the vows already?
but, Your Greatness, General Li Shang is not a son of Qui Gong.
Silence!
I am the Golden Dragon of Unity.
and I decide whom to unify.
my all-seeing eye has peered into the very heart of China.
and I've never seen two people more right for one another than this lovely couple right here, Mulan and Shang.
give it up for them, would you please?
now, I command you to proceed at once.
Yes, Your Greatness, as you command.
now let's get down to business. Mulan, do you love Shang?
of course you do. Shang, do you love Mulan?
Yes, very much, moving on.
by the power vested in me, by me.
I hereby pronounce you husband and wife.
you got anything to say, Lord Double Chin?
Yes. I mean, no.
I mean, whatever you say.
and furthermore, I hereby decree that the princesses of the Middle Kingdom, wherever they may be, are released from their vow and may marry whomsoever they please.
and who pleases them, that's very important.
honey pie.
I can't believe I'm back on wake-up duty.
well, Mulan is happy.
and if she's happy, I'm happy.
thank you, Cri-Kee.
I did do good, didn't I?
better get your rest, Mushu.
I have a yoga session at dawn, and I don't want to be late for my greetings to the sun.
and don't forget.
I like to be awakened from my beauty sleep with a nice long foot massage.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Shang, what are you doing? - Watch and see.
what is he doing? - It can't be.
he's combining the family temples.
no.
excuse me, what does that mean exactly?
you know, for me?
it means...
Yeah, what, what? It means what?
unfortunately, you get to keep your pedestal.
Yeah.
I'm back, baby.
I am back!
Yes.
so this is the famous Mushu?
somehow I pictured you bigger.
say what?
you told him about me? About us?
I have no secrets from my husband, Mushu.
I told him everything.
everything everything?
that's right, Great Golden Dragon of Unity.
I still don't get it.
what does combining our temples do?
it gives me back my pedestal.
wait, but can you do this?
aren't there rules? - Of course.
right next to the rules about dressing up like a man and joining the army.
well, what do you know?
this thing just might work out after all.
Hey, yo, where's my masseuse?
saving China gives me knots like you wouldn't believe.
and what about my pedicure?
let's get jamming on the toe jam, people.
and somebody heat up some oil.
I don't know what we're gonna do with it yet, but it's gonna be good.
does a hero dragon deserve anything less?
draw my bath.
warm my towels. Let the pampering begin.
all of our earliest memories are lies, family mythologies handed down to us repeatedly until they become as real as what actually happened.
get the door, Mama.
you may be king, you may possess the world and it's gold
but gold won't bring you happiness
when you're growing old
the world still is the same, you never change it
get the damn door, Mama.
as sure as the stars shine above
no one in the family can say exactly when my mother went crazy.
according to Grandma, she was always that way.
get the damn door, Mama.
dad said it started when she lost the babies.
seven miscarriages in eight years can tend to do that to a person.
that's why my arrival on the scene came as somewhat of a surprise.
I was born with the umbilical cord wrapped around my neck.
I've been pissed off ever since.
the world still is the same, you never change it
the miscarriages had taken such a toll on Mom that she somehow got it in her head that she'd lost me as well.
well, you're nobody 'til somebody loves you
so find yourself somebody to love
shortly after I was born, my mother drove me to California and placed me in a Catholic orphanage.
I wish I could tell you about my earliest memories there, but the truth is, no one knows.
back home, she claimed I had died at birth and couldn't tell anyone where I was.
what?
two years later, after another miscarriage, she suddenly remembered where she'd left me.
despite all of Mom's craziness, Dad never stopped loving her.
but they divorced, and I was passed around like an unwanted Christmas fruitcake.
eventually, my mother decided she needed to be a fulltime mom again, and that we needed a fresh start.
I disagreed.
you'll have your own room. I already have my own room.
I'll get you bunk beds.
but why do I need bunk beds? I'm an only child.
it wasn't all bad. The best thing in my life was my dad.
his name was Dell Fong, and he was Chinese.
I identify him as being Chinese, because his race is the most vibrant memory I have of him.
Richard, that's not safe. Come on, time to work.
maybe you can be a cook, too, someday.
I could never be a cook like my father because I'd already made my career choice.
superhero.
as a superhero, you occasionally have to deal with something annoying, like Kryptonite.
my Kryptonite was called home.
my mother had this ritual.
every year, she'd celebrate the birthday of each of the children she miscarried by buying them a birthday card and taking an overdose of sleeping pills.
that happened seven times a year.
I wouldn't call her successful at suicide, but she was punctual.
my dad's Kryptonite?
soy sauce.
most people go to their graves with their music inside them.
what was Mr. Holmes saying?
come on, guys, it's not that hard.
he's saying that most people die without discovering their own genius, without expressing the uniqueness that makes them special.
and that's what this little exercise is about.
I want you to give me three minutes about something, anything that you know, that your classmates may not know.
Mr. Pimentel, I like your spirit. Come on up.
butt kisser.
funny how things happen.
only in hindsight do you realize how something as small as raising your hand can change your entire life.
well, have any of you ever eaten chicken at the Golden Dragon, the Rickshaw Gardens or the Chinese Gardens?
well, you know the restaurants don't buy live chickens, right?
they buy dead ones.
and you know where they get those chickens and how those chickens die?
I do, 'cause I killed them. I killed your dinner.
I've chopped the head off chickens for every Chinese restaurant in the city.
you find the biggest knife you can find, then you have to grab the chicken by the lower of its neck and swing...
I could've talked for hours.
Mr. Parks was almost as happy as I was, because he ran the speech club.
... warnings of approaching missiles over the Arctic.
and in other news, Soviet Premier Khrushchev has made great strides in his policy towards peaceful coexistence with nonCommunist countries.
and I believe Premier Khrushchev has made great strides in his policy towards peaceful coexistence with nonCommunist countries.
I may not have been the most original speaker, but I became a star.
forget that superhero dream, now I knew what I really wanted to be.
mom?
I forget whose birthday it was this time.
I just know it wasn't mine.
my mother ended up surviving only to leave me a few months later.
it didn't matter, though, because I had plans.
things didn't happen as quickly as I expected.
a few years after high school, I got a job working in the kitchen of a gogo bar to earn money for college.
Richard, I need that order 10 minutes ago. I don't pay you to stand around.
I still had my dream, but there were a few distractions.
Bambi was a visual effect that would only be rivaled years later by my first viewing of Star Wars.
tiff, you're exposed.
what are you working on?
there's a tournament at Portland State University, and it's open to anybody.
so I figured if I went there and I did really well, I might get noticed, and who knows, maybe a scholarship.
no shit.
what are you gonna wear? I don't know. Probably a sweater.
Oh, honey, no way.
you see that guy over there?
he owns the biggest men's store in town.
girls.
did you hear about the midnight rambler?
everybody got to go
did you hear about the midnight rambler?
well done.
Yeah, thank you, sir.
Hey.
Mr. Pimentel?
I'm Ben Padrow with the University. I'm chairman of the Speech Department.
Hi, Dr. Padrow, I know who you are.
well, congratulations. I'm impressed.
nice suit.
Oh, thank you very much.
where do you go to school?
actually, sir, I'm not in school right now.
I'm a little strapped financially. But I'd love to come to State.
well, we have scholarships and financial aid. We'd love to help.
come see me.
Yes, sir.
you're late.
I'm sorry. I was over at the admissions...
no time for apologies. On the stage, let's go, come on.
I picked three speeches, like you asked. Now, which one do you wanna see first?
the good one. Tick, tock. Come on.
all right.
last meal's been eaten.
last prayer has been said.
the prisoner is strapped into the electric chair...
my black brothers will gladly sacrifice for freedom overseas when there's freedom in Birmingham...
...until my right to vote in this country precedes my obligation to die for it.
just sit down there, please. Right here.
you like it up there?
Yeah, l...
I like it better than anything.
Why?
I don't know.
stop right there.
that's the first honest thing you've said, "l don't know.
you don't know why you're up there.
you don't even know what you're saying.
sure, you're talented and passionate.
you could fool some bluehaired judge in high school, but not here.
this is another league.
wait a minute, l...
I've won every single tournament I've ever entered.
you didn't think that I was good?
I think you're the most gifted, natural speaker I have ever seen, and you have incredible potential.
and you are completely full of shit.
hold on, wait a minute. So that's it?
I've been working towards this for the last six years, all right?
I'm not asking... It doesn't have to be a full scholarship. I can...
look, my advice? You're not ready.
go live a life. Fill yourself up.
find out what's important, earn a point of view.
l...Earn.
earn a point of view. Then come back when you've got something to say.
"get a life," my ass.
I had a life, and there was no way I was going back to it.
fortunately, the government had this program where you could gain valuable life experience and see the world.
they would guarantee your education in exchange for services rendered.
it was called Vietnam.
I Corps 1970
now my girl you're so young and pretty
and one thing I know is true
my reaction may have been a bit hasty.
after six months in country, life in Portland didn't seem all that bad.
watch my daddy in bed adyin'
watched his hair been turnin' grey
he's been workin' and slavin' his life away
Oh, yes, I know it
yeah
he's been workin' so hard Yeah
I've been workin' too, baby Yeah
every night and day
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
we gotta get out of this place
if it's the last thing we ever do
we gotta get out of this place 'Cause girl, there's a better life for me and you
so we're gonna move off this hill before they decide to take it from us.
I need four volunteers to stay behind.
this is your chance to be a hero.
I always wanted to be a hero.
all right, there we go. I need three more.
watch my daddy in bed adyin'
Yeah. Every single day
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
we gotta get out of this place
if it's the last thing we ever do
sector One. Sector One. We need help!
under fire in the sector. Over.
let's move!
we're out. Let's go. We're out.
what you did out there took courage. Know your outfit is proud of you.
I just wanted you to understand that I'm personally proud of you.
I got something planned for you you can enjoy, while you're right here in Vietnam.
carry on.
come here, sister
Papa's in the swing
Oh, the mother lode.
who needs a medal, huh?
I don't want a medal, man.
he ain't no drag
to surviving the surviving.
Papa's got a brand new bag
come here, mama
and dig this crazy scene
he's not too fancy
but his line is pretty clean
he ain't no drag
bring it on, gooks.
Papa's got a brand new bag
incoming!
Richard! Point to where it hurts. Can you hear me?
you got tinnitus. It's ringing in the ears.
I can't hear you.
you're lucky. You only lost half your hearing.
your friends lost theirs completely.
if I'm deaf, why do I hear this noise all the time?
you lost your upper register, and hearing aids won't help.
by the time you can hear those high sounds, the low sounds will be so loud, you'd go crazy. You understand?
can you just make the noise stop?
I can't. That's tinnitus.
some days will be better than others, but it won't stop.
ever.
this is my letter of acceptance to the university.
and I also brought a couple of recommendations.
no, no, I can't authorize this.
I'm sorry. Could you speak up and look at me when...
thank you.
I can't authorize government funds to send you to college.
Why?
you're deaf.
I'm what?
it's a deaf joke.
you're worse than deaf, you're confused.
you can hear only vowels, no consonants.
Yeah.
well, if you can only hear vowels, you've got two choices, learn to read lips or move to Hawaii.
I don't wanna go to Hawaii, I wanna go to college.
listen, even if you graduate, they won't be able to place you.
Why? Cause I'm deaf?
Helen Keller was deaf and blind. She had a job.
no. No, I know she had a job...
no, because of the ringing.
night and day, right? Yeah.
in both ears? Uhhuh.
you won't be able to concentrate. You'll forget what you've read.
you won't have any friends.
you'll be incompetent and you'll be foulmouthed.
no shit?
you know what? Who the hell are you, huh?
you got a desk and a clipboard. You don't know me.
cause if you did, you'd know how close I am to coming over that desk and shoving that clipboard up your fat, pompous ass.
I'm gonna go to college, and I'm gonna graduate, and then I'm gonna get a job, and you can stick that in your goddamn chart.
you ungrateful piece of shit!
get your hands off me, bro!
don't touch me. Get the hell out of here.
don't fucking touch me. Don't come back.
Hey, bro, could you hold it a sec?
Yeah. I'll be right back.
what the hell's wrong with you?
Thanks, man.
damn thing only lights half the time.
hell, I only work half the time myself.
you don't say much. Got a light?
buddy, you got a light?
Hey, man, you deaf?
Yeah, I am.
I heard that. I lost a wheel.
fucking peaceniks.
I'd hate them a lot more if I didn't agree with them.
you wanna get a beer?
what?
a beer. A brew. Cold one.
it's 10: 00 in the morning, man.
so?
no, no thanks.
Mike Stolz.
Mike.
Richard.
like Nixon?
that's awesome. Here you go, bro.
that shit's good for you.
they overran us. Swarmed us, bro.
and it's just me and Jimmy left, and I'm like...
I'm fucking gone. Fuck Jimmy, bro.
and I fucking stand to run, and Jimmy pulls me down and greases this guy that was right on me.
I never saw him.
Jimmy saved my life.
then I look over, tell him, "Let's go, bro.
and Jimmy's head was just gone.
motherfuckers!
he saved my life.
and God forgive me, bro, I was gonna leave him there.
what the fuck, man? Can nobody afford a decent roach clip?
look at this shit. What the fuck is this, bro?
clearly, Kesey's expressing his hatred for conformity.
Yeah, he's celebrating the individual, but I think it's more about the abuse of power.
the individual is disengaged from the society, although...
I think it's more about the abuse of power.
as a result, he acts as a spiritual and emotional...
...authority figure, right?
I...
I forgot something.
Hey, watch it.
chin.
thin.
thin.
gem.
web.
web.
pep.
you come by anytime.
Thanks, Dr. Padrow. Sure.
look like you have a coke problem.
may l?
I...
I don't...
Yeah, don't bother, all right? I'm deaf.
I can read lips, but not that well. Those are gonna make me seasick.
you're welcome.
all right.
damn boy scout.
you think you're too good to talk to me?
wait a minute, I understood that.
you want a fucking medal?
no, I wanna hug you.
how about I shake your hand? Richard.
art.
you better wash your hands.
this may be contagious.
you wanna sit down, Einstein?
Yeah, sure.
you wanna...
the only person on the planet that I could hear was a wickedly obscene genius with cerebral palsy.
and the only person that could understand him was a deaf vet.
we were like a traveling freak show.
how old is that chair, anyway?
I saw tanks in Nam smaller than that thing.
no.
why the hell would I need a new one?
there's nowhere for me to go.
Hey, watch it!
Oh, sorry.
can't you go forward in that thing?
Yeah, sure, if you blow me.
what? What's so funny?
What'd she say?
Oh, she just wants to blow me.
what did that spaz say?
art is what I'm called. A work of art, some would say.
support Art and blow me.
he said he's very, very sorry, and he'll try to be more careful.
Yeah, right. Freaks.
Oh, and blow him.
this reminds me of my childhood.
you used to skate?
I used to sit here with the grandmas and watch everyone else skate.
times they are achanging.
Yeah.
are you a good skater?
Oh, hell no.
it's your thing Do what you wanna do
Oh, yeah.
I can't tell you
who to sock it to
it's your thing
do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
who to sock it to
if you want me to love you
maybe I will
I need you woman, it ain't no big deal
go faster, go faster.
you need love now, just as bad as I do
make's me no difference now
who you give your thing to
Oh, it's your thing
do what you wanna do
whoa, watch it. Hey!
art! Honeyman, stop!
I can't tell if he's hurt or not.
art, are you okay?
I was kicking ass till this chick knocked me down.
she's dangerous.
you okay?
Yeah, next time use a blinker. Ah, yeah.
wait here.
you're a lousy date.
are you listening to me?
you wanna repeat that to my face?
what? What did you say?
what? You heard me.
no, I didn't, actually, I'm deaf.
but I can see what you're saying from over there.
Hey, easy, tiger. Don't get your knickers in a twist.
first of all, you're eavesdropping on a private conversation.
secondly, I can say whatever I want.
yeah? So can l. You're an asshole.
my friend is not a retard.
actually, he's probably smarter than the three of us put together.
he's certainly smarter than you.
he's got cerebral palsy. See, it affects his motor skills.
it means that his brain is perfectly functioning while his body is more or less useless.
if you have a little trouble wrapping your head around that, think of it as the opposite of you. Asshole.
who the hell is this guy?
I'm sorry about my friend.
Yeah, I'm sorry for you, he's a jerk.
sometimes.
you didn't have to threaten him. That was puerile.
What'd she say?
she said you're a dick.
Oh.
you know what, why don't you just head back over to your friend?
the two of you deserve each other.
what is your problem?
you believe that?
she's a fox.
you should've asked her out.
what are you talking about? She just called me a dick.
actually, she said you were immature.
what?
how come you said "dick"?
because it was funnier.
sunshine came softly through my awindow today
could've tripped out easy abut I've achanged my ways
it'll take time, I know it but in a while
Oh. You.
Yeah, remember me? Immature guy.
Yeah. I got class.
Oh, I'll walk you.
no, thanks.
you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now
any trick in the book now, baby
all that I can find
it's sold out. How are we going to get in, genius?
we'll figure that out.
what if that guy's coming?
then the two of you can hold hands. Don't worry about it.
okay, here she comes.
no. You're Richard?
Oh, my God, this is so trippy. What are the odds?
Where's your friend? He's not coming?
Nikos? Nah.
Aw, man.
I don't think this is a good idea.
come on. You need the gas money, we need the ride.
look, come on, I'll be nice. I promise. Please?
Yeah, well, if you're mean, I'll leave you.
all right, that sounds fair. Art, that sound fair to you?
art thinks that's fair. Oh, come on, baby. I'll drive.
I like to dream
Yes, yes, right between my sound machine
on a cloud of sound I drift in the night
any place it goes is right
goes far, flies near, to the stars away from here
well, you don't know what we can find
why don't you come with me, little girl
on a magic carpet ride
you don't know what we can see
why don't you tell your dreams to me
fantasy will set you free
are you guys coming?
Yeah, we'll be right in.
pardon me.
Hi.
you better not molest me back here.
I have a plan. Bite me.
do what?
Oh, my God, he's got me! Help!
help! For the love of God, somebody help me! Help!
no, no, he's contagious. He'll get you, too.
go, go get help. Hurry!
when the truth is found to be lies
and all the joy within you dies
you didn't have a ticket, did you?
sorry?
you didn't have a ticket, did you?
don't you need somebody to love?
wouldn't you love somebody to love?
Hey, hey. I really can't see anything from here.
you better find somebody to love
Hey!
that is so uncool.
Yes, and your mind
better?
your mind is so full of red
don't you want somebody to love?
don't you need somebody to love?
you knew it was me, didn't you?
all my signs disappeared off the campus and you're the only one that called.
I like that.
I need to shower.
you know, I just can't stop thinking about last night.
Jesus Christ!
Hey, morning, Tarzan.
I'd invite you in, but I don't think there's room for both of us in here.
Hey, babe. Hey. You remember Richard.
Uhhuh.
what, do you guys, like, live together?
Yeah. Yeah.
what, are you guys, like, friends or what?
we have an open relationship.
you look a little confused, man. You need me to draw you a picture?
you just spent the night with me and you sleep with this guy, too?
I'm not confining myself.
so are you trying to get back at me?
no, Richard, this is my life.
we had fun last night, right?
I like you, but I like Nikos, too.
Yeah, I like you. I like you a lot.
I can't handle this shit.
Richard?
Richard, I know you hear me.
look, I guess I should've warned you.
maybe before I looked in the shower.
well, let's just have fun. I mean, we don't even know what we have yet.
I think what we have is one too many sausages in the bun.
look, I like to have fun, too, but your idea of fun is a testicle tag team.
no, that's... Wrong guy.
you're oldfashioned. That's cute.
am I going to see you again?
hmm?
okay.
here's how this works.
if you're with me, when you're with me, you're with me.
I don't wanna hear about him, I don't wanna see him,
I don't wanna smell him.
that's fair.
well, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
and I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
pass the towel, baby.
clowns to the left of me Jokers to the right

Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
and I'm wondering what it is I should do
it's so hard to keep this smile from my face
losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place
clowns to the left of me Jokers to the right
here I am Stuck in the middle with you
well, you started out with nothing
and you're proud that you're a self made man
please
please
your grades are excellent.
you're a decorated veteran.
you mind telling me where you were wounded?
I don't usually divulge that information till the second date.
so what do you wanna do with your life, Richard?
I wanna help people. And make a lot of money.
Yeah!
after graduation, I lied about my experience and got a great job with an insurance company.
they had no idea I was deaf.
right here.
careful.
where do you want this?
Yeah, right... Over here.
Hey.
what do you think? I love it.
nobody's asking for handouts, man.
all these cats here, they all wanna work, bro.
they just need somebody to front them, you know?
some buttoneddown asshole who's already got his nose up the man's ass.
somebody with a job, bro.
Yeah, somebody like me.
good idea, bro.
I will give you those things you thought unreal
follow me now and you will not regret
new shirt?
baby, the phone.
Hello?
wait, whose birthday?
they better be the best pancakes on the planet.
forget it, I'm not hungry anymore.
Oh, that's funny.
you know what else is funny? What?
a guy with CP rolling down a flight of stairs.
Hey, buddy, can you hold that for...
thank you, appreciate that.
Hi.
just here.
Yes, your highness.
you want your coat on or off? Off.
okay.
all right.
you need a menu?
no, no. I...
I know what I want.
good evening.
I mean, good morning.
Hi.
Hey, we'll just have the pancakes.
Yeah.
actually, my manager told me that we can't serve.
you can't serve pancakes? Why? They...
they got them.
look, I don't want to sound rude...
no, no, no. You're not rude, it's...
I'm the only one who understands him.
I'm trying my damnedest to not make this a scene.
good. I don't feel there is one.
I think you two need to leave.
you're making the other customers very uncomfortable.
Oh.
Why?
Hey, we can refuse to serve whoever we want here.
you gotta be kidding me.
it's my friend's birthday. All he wants is pancakes.
I... I think she needs some hot man love.
maybe. I'll ask her, but I don't think she's your type, Art.
okay, don't you dare.
you are the ugliest, most disgusting thing I have ever seen.
I thought people like you died at birth.
how do you expect people to eat around you?
normal people shouldn't even have to look at you.
listen, lady.
I'm sorry if I'm doing your job for you.
he says he's very sorry for turning your customers' stomachs.
that's obviously your job. Yeah.
okay, you know what? You guys can leave, or I can call the police.
Oh, oh, wait.
call them.
that night we were arrested for violating what was known as an Ugly Law.
this law made it a crime for anyone to appear in public who is diseased monstrosity or deformity in any way so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object.
Hey, hey, buddy.
watch it, dickwad.
no parkin' by the sewer sign Hot dog, my razors broke
water drippin' up the spout But I don't care, let it all hang out
let it all hang out
let it all hang out
let it all hang out
that horrible waitress had done me a huge favor.
I'd been trying to hide from my past. She made me embrace it.
I quit my nice, highpaying job and went to work for a real jerk.
me.
I coldcalled every business in the phone book.
I wouldn't take no for an answer.
I found jobs for every vet I knew, and in the process, I found a life calling for myself.
all right, Richard, let's see how this sounds.
Dr. Collins, please call extension 2110, stat.
at that time, the only people vets trusted were other vets, so I got a job at a government agency helping them find work.
what is it that you're afraid of, that he can't work with you, or that you can't work with him?
you had to stop and think about that, didn't you?
as soon as I was hired, Mike said he wanted a job.
nothing tickled him more than trying to tear down a system that made no sense to him.
Mike was a natural headhunter.
I'm like Chinese water torture, lady.
I'm gonna keep calling you back till you pull your head out of your ass.
listen, lady, listen to me.
I left my leg in a rice paddy.
I get a big, fat check every month.
I don't need to be begging work for these guys.
but they need me.
and they need somebody like you with balls to give them a freaking chance to make your company better.
what?
yeah? Well, amen, sister.
listen, maybe you and l could get a drink sometime.
all right, maybe not. All right, take care.
the word was out.
I could find jobs for any disabled person, veteran or otherwise.
she's a file clerk and she hasn't missed a day of work in 20 years.
sounds good. Tell him I'm a dwarf. Tell him.
can she start tomorrow?
Yeah. And she's a dwarf.
a what? A dwarf.
how the hell can a dwarf be a file clerk?
she specializes in L through Z.
I have a step stool, stupid.
she got a step stool. Come on.
okay, I'll give her a shot. Right.
have her come in tomorrow. Great.
Hello?
is this the Governor's office?
Yeah, well, this is Richard Pimentel.
I have a note to return a call.
okay.
hello.
Yes, sir.
well...
thank you, sir. Thank you very much. I certainly try.
cause you're an ungrateful piece of shit. 'Cause you're selfish.
what kind of offer?
what?
what? You wanna fucking take me on?
you wanna take me on, tough guy?
Yeah, I would love to talk about that. Absolutely.
I don't give a shit, man.
okay. Thank you very much.
listen, bro, how about I come down there right now and I beat you to death with my plastic leg?
what? When?
you can start tomorrow?
he'll be there.
Hey, bro, listen, you're doing a great thing for a vet, man.
don't fuck it up.
to our future. Absolutely.
so, when the Governor's office called me last week...
whoa. Excuse me?
I guess his office had heard something about me.
I don't remember the exact words, but something like innovator or genius.
but you don't remember? No, not the exact words.
anyway, the upshot is they want me to create a program to train employers to hire and work with the disabled persons.
Seriously? Honey, that's amazing. That's what I thought.
what were they doing before?
there is no before. This is the first time they've done this.
I'd be starting from scratch. Well, you little groundbreaker, you.
you heard about this for a week and you never told me?
well, I didn't know it was going to be definite yet.
and the bad news is I'd have to quit my job.
but the good news is, is that once the program was created, they wanna send me around the country and train all the trainers.
so the good news is you'll be traveling?
Yeah. If you want to, you could come with me for some of it.
what's wrong?
I just... Nothing. Nothing.
well, come on, you seem bummed.
I'm not bummed. It's...
it's just that I hardly see you now as it is, so what's it going to be like when you start traveling?
no, no. This...
look, this is a completely different job. Okay?
when I'm in town, I'm gonna be at home.
I've been working a lot lately and you've been really great about that.
this is a really big deal.
I know.
okay. I'm proud of you.
so when are you gonna tell Mike you're leaving?
Mike's the hardest worker you got, okay?
he's a little bit volatile.
he's a ticking time bomb.
he's effective. That's the important thing, right?
he's completely out of control.
what happens when you're not here to babysit him?
as it is, no one wants to work with him.
the people that he got work for will work with him.
look, I'll talk to him. This job is his life.
I don't care.
I want him gone.
I'm on time, bro. I'm never late.
I wear nice clothes.
who's placed more people than me, even more than you?
no doubt, I know.
you got an unorthodox style, man. It makes management nervous.
so when are you leaving, man?
I go in a week.
fucking A, brother. You're gonna be great.
Thanks.
look, man, I don't have to do this if you're not...
no, don't worry about me.
I'm a survivor, brother. I'm gonna be fine.
Yeah.
sometimes late when things are real
and people share the gift of gab between themselves
some are quick to take the bait
and catch the perfect prize
they wanted me to write the book on hiring the disabled.
I finally had something to say,
I just didn't know how to say it.
but oz never did give nothing to the tin man
that he didn't, didn't already have
and cause never was the reason for the evening
come on, guys. Now, I don't wanna see text in your eyes.
has he told you yet you're full of shit?
cause if you're any good he will, trust me.
ladies and gentlemen, meet Richard Pimentel, the best student I never had.
that's all for today, thank you.
tilting at Windmills. You a Quixote fan?
Yeah.
I was reading it one night and I had an epiphany.
you know, the hardest thing about being disabled is the way that other people treat you.
employers, they don't wanna hire people with disability.
why is that?
they lack confidence in us.
I think you may have that wrong. What do you mean?
you don't need to change their minds about people's disabilities, you need to change their minds about themselves.
I wanna show you something.
lithium? Yeah.
I'm what they call a manicdepressive.
that medicine you're holding allows me to function.
I don't share that with a lot of people.
for years, I didn't wanna accept what I was.
the day you auditioned for me was not a good day.
no, I got a life 'cause of you.
you could've lost it because of me.
I make my own decisions.
I lost my hearing.
I gained a superpower, lipreading.
I can spy on conversations a hundred feet away.
I could have some fun with that at those godawful faculty lunches.
so you don't wear hearing aids? No, they don't help.
I get them from the government, but I just pass them out like candy for Halloween.
do me a favor, I want you to meet someone.
Richard? Yeah.
bill Austin. Come on back with me.
right in here, please. All right.
no offense, but this is all kind of a circle jerk.
I'm just here to humor Ben.
see, I have this ritual with Uncle Sam every year where he tells me how much more deaf I am than the year before, and then I cash his disability checks.
well, there doesn't seem to be too much purpose in living a life with a hearing problem if we can find the right solution.
wait, wait. What are you gonna do with that thing?
I'm going to stick it in your ear, unless you have another place you'd rather I stick it.
ear's good.
now we're ready to try the new hearing aids.
is that them?
they're like a contact lens for the ear.
we've found that smaller's better.
we get a more efficient coupling for the ear when the aid is in the canal.
can you hear me, Richard?
how does it sound? Can you hear me?
can you hear me?
Oh, yeah. That's great.
wash away my troubles Wash away my pain
with the rain in Shambala
wash away my sorrow Wash away my shame
once I started writing again, it was like I tapped a vein.
my central focus was to change the attitudes of employers about persons with all disabilities.
it took me a year to write.
Ah, ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
everyone is helpful Everyone is kind
on the road to Shambala
everyone is lucky Everyone is so kind
on the road to Shambala
what page are you on right now?
I'm on page shut the fuck up.
I've got CP, I'm not deaf.
all right, come in.
come on, man. Say something.
why did you want me to read this?
cause I don't think I know what I'm doing, Art.
but I never would've written that if I hadn't met you.
now, you're the smartest guy that I know, and if you don't think that's any good, I'm just gonna tear it up.
you don't have a clue...
all right, shit. No, let me finish.
you don't have a clue how good this is.
you know what we cripples want besides getting laid?
to be seen.
when they look at me out there now, you know what they see?
nothing.
I'm ignored.
how can you ignore this?
but they ignore me, because
I am so disturbing to their definition of human, that I make them feel.
I love that.
what you've created will help to make them see us.
if you try to tear this up,
I'll kick your ass.
all right.
I threw myself into my career.
I was changing lives and ignoring my own.
I was keynote speaker for the US government, training every agency.
CIA, NASA, the VA, all of them.
my own subversive little goal was to make the federal government into the biggest employer of disabled persons in the country.
Mike would've dug the irony.
Richard, we made plans for this months ago.
why did you wait till now to tell me you can't go?
I just forgot all about it. I'm sorry. So tell them that.
it's an important conference, I'm the speaker.
I can't just not show up, people count on me.
and I don't?
they're strangers at a convention, an audience.
they applaud, you eat it up.
so I have to wonder, are you doing this for them or for you?
I'm doing it for them and I'm doing it for me.
we'll do something special when I get back.
okay?
Richard, this is important to me. I'm asking you not to go.
stop it! I am not doing this right now.
I'll call you from the hotel.
until you've seen this trash can dream come true
you stand at the edge while people run you through
and I thank the lord
there's people out there like you
I thank the lord
there's people out there like you
while Mona Lisas and mad hatters
sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
turn around and say good morning to the night
for unless they see the sky
Hey, baby, it's me. I know it's late, but pick up if you're there.
Hello? Just wanna say that today went really well and I wanted to see how you were doing and tell you that I miss you a lot.
and...
pick up if you're there 'cause I really wanted to tell you that l...
I think I messed up.
Christine?
Christine?
Oh, boy.
the minute I turn my back, you come sniffing around.
you just don't get it, do you?
just go get Christine before I have your visa revoked.
it's okay, Nikos.
you've been seeing him behind my back?
no. I'm just here until I find my own place.
I'm not getting back with Nikos.
does he know that? Of course.
you two sleeping in the same bed together?
Jesus. You don't get it. What?
I just want you to come home.
I'm not coming home. Why?
is this because I don't give you enough attention?
no, it's because I don't give me enough attention.
I've always depended on men like you to make me feel better and take care of me.
I need to be on my own.
all right, well, be on your own. Be on your own with me.
I mean, I'm traveling, I can give you all the space you want.
I'm flailing here, okay? I don't know what you want me to say.
I love you. I wanna be with you.
you don't wanna be with me.
you just wanna win me and put me on a shelf to remind you that you won me.
that's not a relationship, Richard, I think we need to be apart.
I need to figure out who I am and...
and I think you need to figure out what's important to you, too.
Margaret, you have a visitor.
Hi, Mom.
how you feeling?
the doctors tell me I'm doing well.
but I don't feel like it, and neither do l.
schizophrenia humor. That's good, Mom.
you know what I miss?
dancing.
you know who was a good dancer? Richard.
not really.
he took foxtrot, chacha, tango lessons.
I used to take him to the nightclubs.
Oh, we had so much fun.
no, Mom, actually, I didn't.
no 12 year old boy really wants ballroom dancing lessons.
that's a lie.
why'd you do it for two years?
so that I could be with you.
I wanna take a nap now.
but your son came so far to visit you. That's all right.
that's all right. That's okay, it's fine.
here, I wanna give you something.
this is a new standard for disability training for employers nationwide, and I wrote it.
I don't feel like reading anything.
well, I just wanna tell you, Mom, I'm doing great.
I love my job, I'm making a difference.
what do you want?
you want me to pat your hand, say you're a good boy?
I'm not wired that way.
the average ablebodied person doesn't give a damn about the disabled.
would we care about women's rights if they hadn't mobilized?
we're not gonna care about disabled people until they set aside their differences, stop being invisible, and come together for the passage of the ADA.
that would be the Americans with Disabilities Act, am I right?
Yes, exactly, Americans with Disabilities Act.
this bill, simply put, says that you can't discriminate against people simply because they don't look like you.
okay. Why don't we hold that thought right there until...
now that the election has come down to Bush and Dukakis,
I have it on very good authority that the very first candidate who comes out publicly in support of the ADA is gonna get the disabled vote. The whole thing, all of it.
everybody, which is millions of votes for the first candidate that has the balls to come out and support this.
Richard, please, just... One second.
rumor has it that one of our senior elected officials was told by his advisors, okay, "Sir, we have a problem."
there is a horrific disease.
it is infecting homosexuals and drug addicts at an alarming rate, "and it is always fatal.
and you know what he said? You know what his reply was?
he said, "What did you say the problem was?
that is the kind of Nazi Germany mentality that we're looking at here in America, in the late 20th century.
that's it. We're off the air, all right?
somewhere along the way I realized my heart wasn't driving me.
my anger was.
I think Art noticed it first.
you're a complete asshole.
you used to be a partial one, but you graduated.
how the hell did you get in here?
when you're not looking, I can walk.
so you're too busy to see your friends anymore?
too deaf to hear the phone ring?
you know what? Don't bring your wobbling ass in here and try and guilttrip me, all right?
you know who I lectured last week?
I do.
the CIA, man. Fucking CIA.
I'm doing great.
but you don't look great.
yeah? Well, who's this?
but you don't look great.
who's this?
Hey, Mr. Hot Shit Phone Recorder.
I feel like an asshole talking to this thing.
listen man, stuff's kinda snowballing here, you know?
Hey, bro, let me ask you something.
you remember what it felt like on the plane home from Nam?
Mike.
like you had survived hell and from now on it didn't matter what happened 'cause just being alive was a blessing, and you had your whole life ahead of you.
fuck it. I tried.
later, bro.
Mike. Mike. Hey.
shit.
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to make sure the disabled are included in the mainstream.
for too long they've been left out, but they're not going to be left out anymore.
it's Bush. Bush, Bush, Bush.
if Bush wins, you know what that means?
that means I'm gonna have to renovate this whole place just to service these retards.
you know what that's gonna cost me?
no, what's it gonna cost you?
I'm just talking about this Disabilities Act, it's gonna...
Yeah, what's it gonna cost you?
it means I have to put in ramps, I have to put in all these kinds of things.
it's gonna wind up... It's gonna be a big deficit.
right. You might have to spend, what, $1, 000 to get a wheelchair ramp and widen a toilet stall so somebody can take a piss?
sir...
I don't mean anything by it, all right...
Yeah, you do. I'm one of those retards, okay.
I lost my hearing in the war.
you wanna talk about how much that's gonna cost you?
tell you what, go ahead. Go ahead, talk about it, all right?
I won't listen. Say something funny.
tell him.
why don't you tell him a joke about a guy who's got a 180 IQ but he a has a brain disorder so he can't tie his shoe?
huh?
or a worldclass skier who breaks her neck and now she needs a machine to breathe?
that's funny stuff.
and poor you, 'cause now you gotta sink a little bit of money into this pieceofshit restaurant.
you know what? Here you go.
sorry for the inconvenience. Buy yourself a conscience.
Richard? Richard, it's me.
Hey, Christine.
it's been a while. How are you?
good, yeah, I'm just... I'm meeting some friends.
so are you still leading seminars, traveling...
Yeah. Yeah, it's good, it's going really well.
yeah? I'm glad. How's Art?
the same old Art. Is that your husband?
no.
no? You know, it's strange to see you.
I was thinking about you just the other day.
thinking about you a lot, actually. I... Well...
I was remembering the trip to Seattle.
I'm engaged. He's my fianc?
well, is it hot in here or is my life going up in flames?
Richard... I'm kidding.
well, I'm gonna go.
are you okay?
Yeah, absolutely.
he's just an old friend.
Mr. Pimentel, it is urgent that you call us back regarding your mother.
I'm right here, man.
Richard, open the door!
Hey. There's a gas leak. Can't you smell that?
what are you doing, Richard?
why would you do that?
she died.
my mother finally died.
it's okay.
it's hot.
I feel like an idiot.
all the shit I've dealt with, and the thing that gets me is I can't get some mentally ill woman I barely know to ever love me.
well, that's not your fault. She's the one that was damaged.
and she missed being close to a really great person.
what are you doing here, anyway?
I was worried about you. And I came to thank you.
if not for you, I wouldn't be as happy as I am now.
I don't think that's a compliment.
no, it is, it is.
I learned a lot from you. And I came to apologize.
I never told you how glad I am that you're a part of my life.
so after spending my whole life trying to prove myself to someone that was not capable of accepting me,
I finally realized I actually had something in common with my mother, that neither of us much cared whether or not I lived.
but I didn't like that.
so I did what she could never do.
I accepted myself.
two years ago, the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed through Congress.
and last week it became a reality.
Congratulations. You did that.
my teacher, Mr. Parks, would say that I've been able to find my music.
now does that mean that I became a superhero?
no, I don't think so.
although, I do like to wear spandex and a cape around the house sometimes.
the differences that you make that are the ones of lasting importance, they're the little differences that you make in the life of another person.
and all of these people that I got to tell you about tonight, they all made a difference in my life, and I can only hope that somehow I made a difference in theirs.
and that after years and years and years of trying to become larger than life,
I'm now working on maybe being a little smaller.
Hey, you're late.
blow me, Ironsides.
last one in pays.
all right, easy there, Andretti.
come on, cowboy.
two? Please.
follow me.
is this one okay?
Yeah, if you're big tippers.
he's paying, but he's a cheap son of a bitch.
but if you play your cards right, you could have a ride on my chair, baby.
he says I'm buying and I'm a cheap son of a bitch, but if you play your cards right, you can have a ride in his chair.
honey, only if you promise to go real fast.
no, thank you. I think we know what we want.
Yeah.
you got a live one, Honeyman.
Yeah.
here you go.
thank you.
well, that's the slowest service I've ever seen.
it only took us 20 years to get these.
be cool.
you're gonna get us arrested again.
and I probably wouldn't mind.
I think he likes it.
Oh, yeah.
so, I guess this one's mine, huh?
happy birthday to you
you've gotta be kidding me.
happy birthday to you
happy birthday, dear Richard
happy birthday to you
Hey, come on, make a wish.
Yeah.
Hey, Richard. Yeah?
there's something I have always wanted to ask you.
what's that?
does this wheelchair make my butt look big?
I'll see you around, Art.
Yeah.
everyone pretends there's nothing there to reach for
why am I knocking on your door?
it never opened for me before
up against the glass
I wonder what it's like for ordinary people
running through your life
don't you wanna fly?
ordinary people
why am I knocking on your door?
it never opened for me before
sometimes I feel
I shouldn't be, I couldn't be
sometimes I feel
I shouldn't be here
you go the other way
I thought I heard you say
you wish you'd never come
tearing through the time
would you try to right the wrong that has been done?
why am I knocking on your door?
it never opened for me before
sometimes I feel
I shouldn't be, I couldn't be
sometimes I feel
I shouldn't be here
is everybody lost before they're found?
I don't wanna be forgotten this time around
no, no, no
sometimes I feel
I shouldn't be, I couldn't be
sometimes I feel
I shouldn't be here
I shouldn't be here
sometimes I feel
I shouldn't be, I couldn't be
sometimes I feel
I shouldn't be, I couldn't be
sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be
sometimes I feel like I couldn't be
sometimes
sometimes
sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be here
three of a kind, let's do this. -- That's it? Three guys?
two guys on the roof. Every guy gets a share, 5 shares, it's plenty!
6 shares, don't forget the guy who planned the job.
he think he can sit it out and still take a slice. I know why they call him the Joker.
so, why did they call him the Joker?
I heard he wears makeup. -- Makeup?
Yeah, to scare people. You know, war paint.
alright everybody! Hands up! Heads down!
I said hands up heads down!
let's go pal, I'm making a withdraw here.
I said hands up! --No!
here comes the silent alarm.
and there it goes. -- Heads down!
alright, let's just get her out with me.
and just staying down here!
that's funny, it didn't dial out to 911 it was trying to reach a private number.
is it a problem? -- No, I'm done here.
sit down! Down!
I just said down here!
obviously we don't want you doing anything with your hands...
others than holding on to your life!
on to the ground! Stay on the ground! Nobody makes a move!
nobody! Stay down!
do you have any ideas who you are stealing from? You and your friends are dead!
he's out? Right?
where did you learn to count?
they wired this thing up about 5000 volts. What kind of bank does that?
mob bank. I guess the Joker is as crazy as they say.
Where's the alarm guy? -- Boss told me when the guy was done
I should take him out. One less share, right?
funny, he told me something similar. -- He wha-- NO! NO!
that's a lot of money. If this Joker guy was so smart he'd had us bring a bigger car.
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me soon as we loaded the cash.
Ah---No, no, no, no. I kill the bus driver.
bus driver?
what bus driver?
school's up. Time to go. Cop's not getting up, is he?
that's a lot of money.
what happen to the rest of the guys?
think you're smart, huh?
whoever that have hired you
they'll just do the same to you.
Uh...criminals in this town used to believe in things.
honor , respect ... Look at you!
what do you believe in, huh? What do you believe in!
I believe, whatever doesn't kill you, simply makes you stranger.
Mr. Mayor, you were elected in the campaign to clean up the city
when are you going to start? -- On my guard, I believe I already have.
but this so-call, Batman. We heard he is doing some good, the criminals are running scared
but I say... -- No mate, not tonight.
what are you, superstitious? You got more chance winning the powerball than running into him!
it works, Mayor says you're closing in on the Batman.
the investigation is on-going.
Batman Suspects
ever intending to see your wife again Lieutenant?
I thought you had to go look after you mother, detective.
I checked her back into the hospital. -- I am sorry.
so he hasn't shown up? -- I hope he doesn't.
I like reminding everybody that he's out there.
why won't he come? -- Hopefully
because he's busy.
that's why we bring Dogs.
look what your drugs did to my customers.
buyer beware. I told you my compound would take you places.
I never said they'd be places you wanted to go.
my business is repeat customers!
you don't like what I have to offer. You can buy from someone else.
assuming Batman left anyone to buy from.
my dogs are hungry!
pity there's only one of you.
that's not him.
that's more like it.
don't let me find you out here again. -- We're trying to help you!
I don't need help! -- Not my diagnoses.
what gives you the right? What's the difference between you and me?
I'm not wearing hockey pads.
he can't resist showing us his face.
what's he hiding under that makeup?
err, can we get a minute, people please?
him again? Who are the others?
another bunch of small timers.
some of the mark bills I gave you. -- My detectives have been making drug buys with them for weeks.
this bank puts another drug for the mobs, that makes 5.
we found the vault of their dirty cash. -- Time to move in.
we'll have to hit all banks, simultaneously... SWAT teams, backups
what about this Joker guy? -- One man, or the entire mob?
he can wait. -- Well the new DA hears about this.
he wants in. -- Do you trust him?
it will be hard to keep an eye, I hear he's as stubborn as you are...
Wayne Enterprise Private Property No Trespassing
it'll be nice when Wayne Manors rebuilt.
you can swap not sleeping in the penthouse, to not sleeping in the mansion.
whenever you stitch yourself up
you do make a bloody mess. -- Yeah. It makes me learn from my mistakes.
you ought to be pretty knowledgeable by now then.
my armor, carried too much weight. Need to be...need to be faster.
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.
did you get mauled by a tiger? -- It was a dog.
huh? -- It was a big dog.
more copycats last night, Alfred. With guns.
why don't you hired them and take the weekend off?
that wasn't exactly what I had in mind, when I said I wanted to inspire people.
I know. But things had been improved.
look at the new district attorney!
I am, closely. Need to know if he can be trusted.
are you interested in his character? Or his...social circle?
who Rachel spends her time with is her business.
I trust you don't have me followed on my day off?
if you ever took one I might.
know your limits, Master Wayne. -- Batman has no limits.
well you do sir. -- Well, can't afford to know them.
and what's gonna happen on the day that you find out?
we all know how much you like to say "I told you so.
on that day Master Wayne, even I won't want to...Probably.
sorry I'm late folks.
where were you? -- Worried you'd step up?
Harvey, I know these briefs backwards. -- Well then, fair is fair.
heads I'll take it and tails is all yours.
Oh yeah, you wanna flip the coins to see who leads?
it's my father's lucky coin! As a recall, it got me my first date with you.
I won't leave something like that up to chance.
I don't. I make my own luck.
all raise. Judge Surrillo presiding.
I thought the DA just play golf with the Mayor, things like that?
tea off's 1: 30. More than enough time to put you away for life, Sally.
with Carmine Falcone in Arkham, someone must have step up to run the so-call "family"?
is that man in this courtroom today?
could you identify him for us please? -- You win counselor.
it was me.
I have a sworn statement
from you, that this man, Salvatore Maroni.
is the new head of the Falconey Crime Family. -- Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization. -- Orders!
permission to treat the witnesses hostile -- Granted.
hostile? I'll show you hostile!
Carbon-Fibre, 28 caliber, made in China.
if you wanna kill a public servant, Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy American.
get him out of here. -- You honor, I'm not done.
we'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni, so we wont be able to charge him
but the fact they're trying to kill you means we're getting to them.
I'm glad you're so pleased Rachel. I'm fine, by the way.
come on Harvey, you're Gotham's DA. If you're not getting shot at, you're not doing your job right?
you said you were rattled, we could take the rest of the day off.
I can't. I dragged the head of the Major Crime Unit down here.
Oh Jim Gordon? He's a friend actually. Try to be nice.
I hear you get a hell of a right cross?
it's...it's a shame Sal's going to walk.
yeah well good thing about the Mob is they keep giving you second chances.
lightly irradiated bills.
fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?
I liaise with various agencies. -- Save it Gordon, I want to meet him.
official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as Batman on sight.
then what about that flip light on top of MCU? -- If you got problems with malfunction equipments
I suggest that you take them out to alignment, counselor.
I put every new money launderer in Gotham behind bars but the mob's still getting its money out.
I think you and your friend, had found the last game in town and you're trying to hit them where it hurts.
their wallets, it's bold.
you gonna count me in? -- Well this town the fewer people know something, the safer the operation.
Gordon, I don't like that you got your own special unit.
and I don't like it is full of cops, are investigated in the internal affairs.
if I didn't work with cops you investigated, like you're making your name in I. A. I'd be working alone.
I don't get political points from being an idealist. I have to do the best I can with what I have.
you want me to back warrants for search and seizure on five banks without telling me what we're after?
I can give you the names of the banks. -- Well, that's a start.
I'll get you your warrants, but I want your trust.
Oh you don't have to sell me, Dent. We all know you're Gotham's White Knight.
yeah well, I heard they have a different name for me down in MCU.
I won't know about that.
in China, Lau security investment stands for dynamic new growth.
the joint Chinese venture with Wayne enterprises, will be a powerhouse.
well Mr. Lau, I speak for the rest of the board
and Mr. Wayne, in expressing our own excitement.
sir, I know that Mr. Wayne is curious about how his trust fund gets replenished, but
frankly, this is embarrassing. -- You worry about the diligence, Mr. Reese.
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.
its done. It...the numbers are solid. -- Do them again.
wouldn't want the trust fund to run out now, would we?
another long night? This joint venture was your idea. My consultant loves it.
but I'm not convinced. Lau's company had gone by 8% annually like clockwork.
his revenue stream must be off the books. Maybe even illegal.
OK, cancel the deal. -- You already knew?
just needed a closer look at their books.
need anything else you can trouble me for? -- I need a new suit.
Yeah, 3 buttons is a little 90's Mr. Wayne. -- I am not talking about fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function. -- You want to be able to turn your head.
sure make backing out of the driveway easier. -- I'll see what I can do.
took me 3 weeks to get reservation here, and I had to tell 'em I work for the government.
Really? -- This city's health inspector isn't afraid to pull strings.
Rachel, fancy that. -- Yeah Bruce, fancy that.
Rachel, Natasha. Natasha, Rachel.
Natasha, are you ...the... -- Premier Ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.
wow, Harvey's taking me next week. -- Really, so you're into ballet?
Bruce, this is Harvey Dent. -- The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel told me everything about you. -- I surely hope not.
so, let's put a couple of tables together. -- I'm not sure that they'll let us.
well, they should. I own the place.
how could you want to raise children in a city like this?
well, I was raise here, it turn out ok.
is Wayne Manor in the city limits?
the palisades? -- Sure.
you know, as the new DA you might want to figure out the...where your jurisdiction ends.
I am talking about the kind of city that idolizes the masked vigilante.
Gotham City is proud of the ordinary citizens standing up for what's right.
Gotham needs hero like you, elected official
not the man who thinks he's above the law. -- Exactly.
who appointed the Batman? -- We did!
all of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city.
but this is a democracy, Harvey. -- When the enemies were at the gates
the Romans will suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city.
it wasn't considered honor, it was considered a Public Service.
Harvey, the last man that they appointed to protect their republic was name Caesar
and he never give up his power. -- Ok, fine.
you either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become a villain.
look, whoever the Batman is he doesn't want to do this for the rest of his life. How could he?
Batman is looking for someone to take up his mantle.
someone like you, Mr. Dent?
maybe, if I'm up to it.
what if Harvey Dent is the caped crusader?
if I were sneaking out every night, someone would have noticed by now.
well, I'm sold, Dent. I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.
that's nice of you Bruce, but I'm not up for reelection for 3 years.
no, you don't understand. One fundraiser with my pals
you'll never need another cent.
what the hell is this?
as you all aware, one of our deposits was stolen.
a relatively small amount...68 million.
who stupid enough, steal from us?
2-bit whack-job, wears a cheap purple suit and makeup
he's not the problem, he's nobody.
the problem is -- our money being tracked by the cops.
thanks to Mr. Maroni's well placed sources
we know that police have indeed identified our banks using marked bills
end up planning to seize your funds, today.
and since the enthusiastic new DA has put all my competitors out of business
I am your only option. -- So what do you propose?
moving all deposits to one secure location, not a bank.
where then? -- No one can know but me.
if the police were to give pressure on one of you, everyone's money would be at stack.
what stops them getting to you? -- I go to Hong Kong
far from Dent's jurisdiction, and the Chinese will not extradite one of their own.
how soon you move the money? -- I already have.
for obvious reasons, I couldn't wait for your permission.
rest assured, your money is -- safe.
and I thought my jokes were bad.
give me one reason why I shouldn't have my boy here pull your head off.
how about a magic trick?
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.
T'da!! It's ... gone!
Oh and by the way, the suit it wasn't cheap, you all'd know, you bought it.
sit, I want to hear proposition.
let's wind the clocks back a year.
these cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you...
Ermm I mean...What happened? Your...Your balls drop off? Hmm?
you see, a guy like me... -- Freak!
guy like me... Look, listen!
I know why you choose to have your little group therapy sessions in broad daylight.
I know why you're afraid to go out at night.
the Batman.
you see Batman has shown Gotham your true colors, unfortunately
Dent? He's just the beginning.
and as for the television so call "plan."
Batman has no jurisdiction. He'll find him and make him squeal!
I know the squealers when I see them...And
what do you propose? -- It's simple, we...kill the Batman.
if it's so simple, why haven't you done it already?
if you're good at something, never do it for free.
and what you want?
Err...Half.
you are crazy. -- I'm not.
no, I'm not.
if we don't deal with this...now
soon little.err...Gambol here, won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma.
enough from the Clown!
let's not blow this out of proportion.
you think you can steal from us and just walk away? -- Yeah?
I'm putting a word out -- 500 grant for this clown, dead.
a million alive, so that I can teach him some manners first.
alright, so listen...why don't you give me a call when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously.
here's my card.
you're a hard man to reach.
Lau's half way to Hong Kong.
if you'd asked, I could have taken his passport. I told you to keep me in the loop.
all that was left in the vaults were marked bills.
they knew we were coming! As soon as you office get involve
my office? You're sitting down there with scums like Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking?
Oh yeah Gordon, I almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beef.
don't trying cloud the fact that clearly Maroni's got people in your office, Dent!
we need Lau back
but the Chinese won't extradite international under any circumstances.
if I get him to you, can you get him to talk?
I'll get him to sing. -- Look, if we going after the mob's life-savings
things will get ugly. -- I knew the risks when I took this job, lieutenant.
how you get him back in
he does that.
our Chinese friend left town before I could tell him the deal was off.
I'm sure that you've always wanted to go to Hong Kong.
what's wrong with Hong Kong?
I think Mr. Lau deserves a more... personal touch.
now for high altitude jobs, you gonna need oxygen and stabilizers.
well I must say I'm afraid your "usual" requests
jumping out of an airplane, is pretty straightforward.
then what about getting back into the plane?
I'd recommend a good travel agent. -- Without the landing.
now that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.
the CIA had a program back in the 60's for getting their people out of hot-spots call "Sky-Hook."
you can look into that.
Yeah. -- Ok.
now.
hardened kevlar plates on a titanium-dipped tri-weave fibers -- for flexibility you'll be lighter, faster, more agile.
perhaps you should read the instructions first. -- Yeah.
now there is a tradeoff, separation of the plates makes you more vulnerable to knifes and gunfire.
Ah, we won't wanna leave things too easy now, would we?
how well they hold up against dogs?
we're talking Rotweilers or Chihuahuas?
should do fine against cats.
I found one in Arizona.
that very nice man said that he could have it up and running in a week and he takes cash.
what about the flight crew? -- Star cruise smugglers.
they run flight to the Pyongyang below radar the whole way.
did you think of an alibi? -- Oh yes.
love Boat: Billionaire Asconds With Entire Russian Ballet.
can't believe this is your plane, Sir.
you look tired, Alfred. You'll be alright without me?
you can tell me the Russian for apply your own bloody suntan lotion.
yo Gambol, somebody here for you. They said they've just killed the Joker.
they brought the body?
so, the dead, that's 500
How're about a live? Hmm?
you wanna know how I got these scars?
my father was...a drinker
and a fiend.
then one night, he goes off crazier than usual
mummy gets the kitchen knife and defends herself
he doesn't like that, Not-One-Bit
so, me watching
he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it
he turns to me, and he says
why so serious, son?
he comes at me with a knife
why so serious, son?
sticks the blade in my mouth.
let's put a smile on that face!
and...
why so serious?
now. Our organization is small
but, there is a lot of potential for aggressive expansion.
so which of you fine gentleman would like to join our team?
Oh, there is only one spot open right now so we gonna have try outs!
try outs!
make it fast.
welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox. Mr. Lau regrets he's unable to meet you in person today.
I understand.
for security purposes, I'm gonna have to ask you to check your mobile.
of course.
I must apologize for leaving Gotham in the middle of our negotiations
there's a misunderstanding with the Gotham police force
I couldn't let such a thing threaten my company. -- Of course.
a business man of your stature will understand, and
with you here now, we can continue.
well I do appreciate you bringing me out here in such style Mr. Lau, but I really
we do not allow cell phones in here. -- Sorry, forget I had it.
no, I really came to tell you that our business deal has to be put on hold
you see, we can't afford to be seeing to do business with
whatever it is you're accused of being...I'm sure a business man of your stature will understand.
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call might have sufficed.
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think that he was deliberately wasting your time.
just accidentally wasting it.
that's very good, Mr. Lau. Accidentally. Very good.
Hi, Sir.
got better view from the peak tram.
how is the view from LSI holdings? -- Restricted.
Lau's holed up in there good and tight. -- What is this?
I had R&D work it out. Send out a high frequencies and records
that response time, to mapp an environment.
sonar. Just like a-- -- Submarine, Mr. Wayne. Like a submarine.
and other device? -- It's in place.
Mr. Wayne. Good luck.
OK, very well.
hmm? Why the lights go on and off?
go check it out.
this is the lobby, can you hear me?
where are the cops? -- They are on their way.
we paid them for such slow service?
let me go! Let me go! Nooooo! I'll give you anything, let me go!
hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire!!!
please deliver to: Lieutenant Gordon.
look, give us the money and we'll talk about making a deal.
the money is the only reason I'm still alive.
Oh you mean, when they find out that you helped us, they will gonna kill you?
are you threatening my client? -- No, I'm just assuming your client's cooperation with this investigation
can solve everything. No?
OK, enjoy your time in county, Mr. Lau.
wait. I won't give you the money
but I will give you my clients, All of them.
you were glorified accountant.
what could you possibly had on all of them, that we could charge?
I'm good with calculation, I handle all their investments.
one - Big - Pot.
got it! -- One minute.
Rico. If they pool their money, we can charge them all as one criminal conspiracy.
charge them with what?
in a Rico case if you can charge one of the conspirators with authority, you can
charge all of them, that's great!
Mr. Lau.
what kind of details, do you have about this communal fund?
ledger? Notes-- -- Immunity, protection and a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
after you testify in open court, and I'm just curious...with all you clients locked up
what's gonna happen with all that money?
like I said, I'm good with calculation.
he can't go to county.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells. -- What is this Gordon, your fortress?
well, you trust them over county?
I don't trust them here.
lau stays.
well I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel arrangements
but I'm sure glad he's back.
put words out, we're hiring the Clown.
he was right, we have to fix real problem
Batman.
I'm not aware of any participation by the Batman
our boy looks good on the tube.
you sure you wanna embarrass me in front of my friends, lieutenant?
don't you worry, they're coming too.
have a nice trip, see you next fall. -- 712 counts of extortion,
849 counts of racketeering, 246 counts of fraud
87 counts of conspiracy and murders...
527 counts of extraction of justice. How do the defendants plead?
order in court. -- 549 criminals at once.
how did you convince Surrillo to hear this farce?
she shares my enthusiasm for justice, after all she is a judge.
well even if you blow enough smoke to get convictions out of Surrillo
you're gonna set a record in the appeal, for quickest tick in the ass.
it won't matter. The head guy makes bail, sure. But the middle level guy, they can't.
they can't afford to be off the street long enough to trial appeal, they'll cut deals include in jail time
think about what you can do with 18 months of clean streets.
Mr. Mayor, you can't-- -- Now get out, both of you.
sit down.
public likes you, that's the only reason that this might fly
but that means it's on you. They all gonna come after you now.
and not just the Mobs, Politicians, Journalists, Cops ...
anyone's wallet's about to get lighter.
are you up to it? You better be...
cause they get anything on you
and those criminals are back on the streets, followed strictly by you and me.
I think your fundraiser will be a great success, Sir.
and why do you think I wanna hold a party for Harvey Dent?
well I assume it was your usual reason to socialising beyond myself and the scum of Gotham's underbelly.
to try and impress Miss Dawes. -- Very droll, but very wrong, actually...it's Dent.
the image is disturbing. -- Tell them your name.
Brian...Douglas...
are you the real Batman? -- No.
no? Then why do you dress up like him?
he is a symbol, so we don't have to be afraid of scum like you.
Yeah, you do Brian. You Really do.
so you think, Batman makes Gotham a better place?
look at me, look at me!
you see this is how crazy Batman makes Gotham.
you want order in Gotham.
Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in.
Oh and everyday he doesn't, people will die.
starting tonight.
I'm a man of my word.
Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld. Scared stiff by the trust fund brigade.
Rachel ... -- Little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?
Alfred, right? -- That's right, Sir.
Rachel talks about you all the time. You've known her her whole life.
Oh not yet, Sir.
any psychotic ex-boyfriend I should be aware of? -- Oh, you have no idea...
I'm sorry that I'm late. I'm glad to see that you all got started without me
now, where...is Harvey?
where ... Harvey Dent, man of the hour.
where is Rachel Dawes. She is my oldest friend. Come here.
you know when Rachel first told me that she was dating Harvey Dent, I have one thing to say
the guy from these god-awful campaign commercials? "I believe in Harvey Dent" Ya, nice slogan, Harvey.
but, you got Rachel's attention. And then I started to pay attention to Harvey.
and all that he's been doing, as our new DA, and you know what?
I believe in Harvey Dent. I believe that on his watch
Gotham can feel a little safer, a little more optimistic
look at this face. This is the face of Gotham's bright future.
to Harvey Dent. Let's cheer for him.
Harvey may not know you well enough to understand when you're making fun of him, but I do.
no, I meant every word.
you know that day when you once told me about that Gotham will no longer need Batman
it's coming -- You can't ask me to wait for that.
it's happening now. Harvey, is that hero.
he locked up half of the city's criminals, and he did it without wearing a mask.
Gotham needs a hero with a face.
you can throw a party, Wayne. I'll give you that.
thanks again.
mind if I borrow Rachel?
lieutenant, that joker card pinned to the body, forensics found 3 sets of DNA
any matches? -- All three. The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb. -- The Joker is telling us he is targeting
get a unit over to Surrillo's house. Tell Wuertz to find Dent.
get them both into protective custody. Where is the Commissioner?
city Hall. -- Seal the building
no one in or out until I get there! -- Got it!
Gordon! What are you up to?
Secure...I want a floor by floor search of the entire building.
sorry Sir, we believe the Joker's made a threat against your life.
these are dangerous people, Judge. -- Yeah, but you're not giving me enough information
even we don't know where you're going. Take the envelope, get in, open it
it will tell you where you're headed.
you can not leave me alone with these people. -- The whole Mobs are after you, and you're worry about these guys?- Yeah, but compare to these the Mob doesn't scare me.
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this for yourself, so
take my word. Police Commissioner under a lot of threats
I found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago.
think cunning for you makes you see things clearly. -- Yeah, I bet.
Yeah, it makes you think, about things you couldn't stand losing
about who you wanna spend the rest of your life with. -- It's pretty big commitment.
well, the Mobs has their way.
you got to explain to my wife, why I'm late for dinner, Lieutenant.
sir, the Joker card had traces of your DNA on it
don't do that. -- Alright.
let's be serious then. -- Ok.
what's your answer?
I don't have an answer.
how did he get my DNA? -- Somebody with access to your office or your house must have lifted a
tissue, glass... Wait! Wait!
well I guess no answer is a "No." -- Harvey ...
is someone else, isn't it? -- Harvey ...
just tell me it's not Wayne, that guy is a complete
what are you doing?
get a medic!!!
they're coming for him.
we made it!
stay in.
good evening, ladies and gentleman.
we are...tonight's entertainment.
I only have one question.
where is Harvey Dent?
you know where Harvey is? Do you know who he is?
hands up, pretty boy.
do you know where I can find Harvey? I need to talk to him about something
just something, a little, huh? NO.
what's going on out there? Wayne!
Oh thank god you've got a panic room. -- Hey, wait!
Oh, you gotta be kidding.
you know, I'll settle for his love ones. -- We are not intimidated by thugs.
you know
you remind me of my father.
I hate my father. -- OK, Stop!
well, Hello~ Beautiful~
you must be Harvey's squeeze, hmm?
and you are beautiful.
well you look nervous, is it the scars?
you wanna know how I got them?
come here, here! Oh come here!
so I had a wife, a beautiful, like you
who tells me, I worry too much
who tells me, I ought to smile more
who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks
one day they carve her face. We got no money for surgeries
she can't take it.
I just want to see her smile again.
I just want her to know I don't care about the scars, So
I stick a razor into my mouth, and did this
to myself. And you know what?
she can't stand the sight of me!
she leaves. Now I see the funny side.
now I'm always smiling.
a little fight in you
I like that. -- Then you gonna love me!
drop the gun.
let her go. -- Very poor choice of word.
are you alright?
let's not do that again.
is Harvey ok? -- He is safe.
thank you.
Jim, it's over. -- As long as they don't get to Lau
we cut off their funds. -- The prosecution is over
nobody is standing up in front of the judge while judges and police commissioners are getting blown away.
what about Dent? -- If he's got any sense, Dent's half way to Mexico
so where do you keep your trash?
you are due in court
I need you alive long enough to get you on the record. -- You can't protect me.
you can't even protect yourself. -- You refuse to cooperate, you're not coming back here, you go to county.
how long you calculate you'll last in there?
targeting me won't get their money back
I knew that the Mob won't go down without a fight, but this is different.
they've cross the line. -- You cross the line first
sir, you squeeze them, you hammered them to the point of desperation
and in their desperation, they turned to a man they didn't fully understand.
criminals aren't complicated, Alfred. We just need to figure out what he's after.
with respect, Master Wayne. Perhaps this is the man you don't fully understand, either.
a long ago, I was in Burma, my friends and I were working for the local government.
they were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders by bribing them with precious stones.
but their caravans were being raided in the forest north of Rangoon by bandit.
so we went looking for the stones.
but in 6 months, we never meet anyone who traded with them.
one day, I saw a child playing with a ruby the size of a tangerine.
the bandit had been throwing them away.
so why steal them? -- Well, because he thought it was good sports? Because
some men, aren't looking for anything logical, like money
they can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with
some men, just want to watch the world burn.
... Lincoln orchards, you'll find Harvey Dent there.
check the names.
richard Dent.
Patrick Harvey. -- Harvey Dent.
I need 10 minutes of the scene before your men contaminate it.
us contaminate it? It's because of you these guys are dead! -- Detective!
that's brick underneath, you wanna take ballistic off a shattered bullet?
no.
fingerprints.
well whatever you gonna do, do it fast.
cause we found his next target
he's putting it in tomorrow's paper.
I'm not sure you made it loud enough, Sir?
what can I do for you, Mr. Reese?
you want me to do the diligence from the LSI holdings deal again?
well, I found some irregularities. -- Their CEO is in police custody?
no, not with their numbers, with yours.
applied Sciences, whole division of Wayne Enterprises just...disappeared, overnight.
I went down to the archives and I started polling some old files.
you wanna tell me you didn't recognize your baby out there pancaking cop cars in the evening news.
now, you got the entire R&D department burning your cash claiming, err
it's related to the cell phones for the army? What are you building for him now?
Err...Rocket ship?
I want 10 million dollars, a year, for the rest of my life.
let me get this straight.
you think that your client
one of the wealthiest, most powerful man in the world is secretly a vigilante
who spends his night beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands
and your plan, is to blackmail this person?
good luck.
keep that.
this is your original scan.
here it is, re-engineered.
and there's the thumb print he left when he push it around in the clip.
I'll get you a copy. Uh, Mr. Wayne
did you reassign R&D? -- Yeah.
government telecommunications Project. -- I wasn't aware we had any new government contracts.
OK Lucius, I'm playing this one pretty close to the chest
fair enough.
with no word from the batman, even as they mourn commissioner Loeb, these cops have to be wondering
the Joker will make good on his threat in obituary column of the Gotham Times -- to kill the Mayor.
I've checked all the databases, there are four possibles.
cross references the addresses. Look for park side.
overlooking the parade.
I've got one, Melvin White.
1502 Rendalf Apartments.
aggravated assault, moved to Arkham twice.
what do you got on the roof? -- We're tight, but frankly there's a lot of windows up here.
commissioner Loeb, dedicated his life to law enforcement
and to the protection of his community.
I remember when I first took off, and I asked him if he wanted to stay on his commissioner, and
he said he would, provided I kept my vow
clearly he was not a man who minced words nor should he have been.
number of policies that he had acted as commissioners
were unpopular, policies had flooded my office with angry calls and letter
who is this? -- What happened?
he took our guns and ...uniforms.
we must remember that vigilance is the price of safety.
stand by. Honor! Guard! All attention! Hu!
forward! Ho!
ready! Aim! Fire!!! Ready! Aim! Fire!!!
stay down, don't move!
Mr. Mayor! Get him out of here!
I'll see you later. -- Why are you going back!
get out of here!
tell me what you know about the Joker.
no!... -- I am sorry about that.
Jimmy, go find your sister. Go ahead!
if there's anything we can do, anything you need, we're here for you.
you brought this crazy disorder, you did! You brought this.
switch it off, he ain't coming.
he does not want to talk to us.
God help whoever he does wanna talk to.
can we go some place quieter?
we can't hear each other talk! -- What makes you think I wanna hear you talk?
what?
yeah? Ok. Harvey, where are you? -- Where are you?
I'm where you should be, at major crime. I'm dealing with all these mess
can I have the fingerprint analysis? -- Rachel, Rachel, Listen to me. You're not safe there.
Oh, this is Gordon's unit. -- Gordon's gone Rachel -- He vouched for these men. -- And he's gone.
the Joker's named you next. God if there's someone. anyone in this town we can trust.
Bruce...we can trust Bruce Wayne.
no, Rachel come on, I know you... -- Harvey, trust me.
Bruce's penthouse now is the safest in the city.
then you go straight there. You don't tell anybody where you're going and I'll find you there. I Love you.
I want the Joker.
from one professional to another. If you're trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot.
from this height, the fall wouldn't kill me. -- I'm counting on it.
where is he? -- I don't know where he is, he found us.
he must have friends. -- Friends? You met this guy?
someone knows where he is. -- Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.
there're wise to your act. You got rules, the Joker, he's got no rules.
nobody's gonna cross him to you. You want this guy, you got one way
but you already know what that is. Just take off that mask, let him come find you.
or you want to let a couple more people get killed while you make up your mind?
you wanna play games?
how's that feel? -- You won't.
I would!
you don't think I will? You don't think I will?
no, no I won't.
that's why I'm not gonna leave it up to me.
heads, you gotta keep your head
tails...not so lucky.
so, you wanna tell me about the Joker?
let's go again. -- I don't know anything! I don't!
you're not playing the odds, friend.
let's do it again.
you'd leave a man's life to chance? -- Not exactly.
his name is Jeff Thomas. He's a paranoid schizophrenic.
a former patient of Arkham, the kind of mind the Joker attracts, what do you expect to learn from him?
joker killed Gordon. He's gonna kill Rachel.
you are the symbol of hope, I can never be.
you stand against organized crime as the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham in decades
if anyone saw this, everything will be undone
all the criminals you pulled off the streets will be released and Jim Gordon would have died for nothing.
you gonna hold a press conference tomorrow morning. -- Why?
no one else will die because of me, Gotham is in your hands now.
you can't! You can't give in!
you can't give in!!!
Harvey called. He says Batman gonna turns himself in.
I have no choice. -- You honestly think that's gonna keep the Joker from killing people?
maybe not, but I have enough bloods on my hands
I've seen now, what I will have to become to stop man like him.
you once told me that if the day came, when I was finished, then we'd be together.
Bruce, don't make me your one hope for a normal life.
did you mean it?
Yes.
Bruce.
if you turn yourself in, they're not gonna let us be together.
logs as well? -- Everything.
anything that can lead back to Lucius or Rachel.
people are dying, Alfred. What would you have me do?
endure, Master Wayne.
take it, they'll hate you for it. But that's the point of Batman.
he can be the outcast. He can make the choice, that no one else can make
the right choice. -- Well, today I found out what Batman can't do
he can't endure these. Today you get to say:"I told you so.
today I...I don't want to.
but I'll do bloody tell you.
I suppose they're gonna lock me up as well, ...as your accomplice.
accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.
ladies and getlemen, thank you for coming. I've call this press conference for two reasons.
firstly to show the citizens of Gotham, that everything that can be done over the Joker killing is being done.
secondly, is the Batman offers to turn himself in.
but first let's consider a situation.
should we give in to this terrorist's demand? Do we really think that if
you'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante than the lives of the citizens?
the Batman is an outlaw
but that's not why we're demanding he turn himself in, we're doing it because we're scared.
we've been happy to let the Batman clean up ours streets for us until now.
things are worse than ever! -- Yeah! Yeah!
Yes, they are.
the night is darkest just before the dawn.
I promise you...the dawn is coming.
one day, the Batman will have to answer to the laws he's broken
but to us, not to this mad man.
no more dead cops! -- Yeah! Yeah!
he should turn himself in!
so be it. Take the Batman into custody.
Alfred!
why is he letting Harvey do this? -- He went down to the press conference
I know, and he just stood by. -- Perhaps both, Bruce and Mr. Dent
believe that Batman stands for something more important
than a whimps of terrorist, Miss Dawes.
even if everyone hates him for it.
that's the sacrifice he's making, he's not being a hero
he being something more
Yeah, you're absolutely right. Letting Harvey take the fall for this is not heroic at all.
you know him better than anyone. -- I do.
will you give this to him for me, when the time is right?
how would I know? -- It's not sealed.
goodbye, Alfred.
goodbye, Rachel.
sorry, I don't have time to talk this through with you. -- What are you doing?
they're transfering me to the centre holding.
this is the Joker's chance, and when he attacks, then I will take him down.
listen to me. This is too dangerous.
we get this guy to county, and he is their problem. Streets will be clear along your route.
let's go. Let's go. -- The convoy stops for no reason.
hope you got some moves, pal. -- He's using you as bait
he doesn't even know, if he can get the Joker, he's failed so far
how do you know what he's thinking? -- I just ... I do!
anyway, Harvey this isn't just about you. What about all the people
who are depending on you to clean the city up, and to do it honorably and
Harvey, tell everyone the truth...
heads I go through with it. -- This is your life!
you can't leave something like that to chance!
I'm not.
you make your own luck.
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal!
what the hell is that?
obstruction ahead! Obstruction ahead!
damn it! All units, divert down onto lower fifth! I repeat, exit down! Exit down!
lower fifth? We'd be like turkeys on thanksgiving down there.
come on, get us out of here, let's go!
listen! We need backup, we got company!
we got trouble, guys.
rock and Roll!!!
what the hell was that?
these thing are built for that, right? -- he's gonna need something a lot bigger to get through this.
what is that?
what is that? A bazooka?
I didn't sign up for this!
look out ... look out!
come on, let's go!
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.
Oh, excuse me, I want to drive.
scanning all systems. Scanning all systems.
we gotta get top sight, we need air support now!
I like this job, I like it!
"damage catastrophic" "Eject sequence Initiated"
good bye
self destruct
we're on point, ready to give some of their own medicine.
that's what I'm talking about, aircraft.
OK, wreck 'em up. Wreck 'em up, wreck 'em up, wreck 'em up.
that's not good...
OK, that's not good!
now there's the Batman.
Oh? You wanna play, come on!
come on!
he missed!
you can't stop here, we're like sitting ducks!
come on, come on, come on...
come on, come on, I want you to do it, I want you to do it, come on!
come on, come on! I want you to do it! I want you to do it, Come on, hit me, hit me!
come on, hit me!!! -- Argh!!!!!!!
hit me!!!
could you please just give me a minute?
we got you, you son-of-the-bitch!
Gordon!
you do like to do things pretty close to the chest. -- We got him, Harvey.
Mr. Dent, Mr. Dent, how does it feel to be the biggest hero in Gotham?
no, I am no hero. Gotham's finest, they are the heroes.
did you and your office have been working with the Batman all alone? -- No, but I trusted him to do the right thing.
such as? -- Saving my ass.
all right people, that's enough. Let him be, let him be! -- Thank you, Detective.
I've got a date with a pretty upset girlfriend. -- Thank you, counselor.
stand away! All of you!
I don't want anything for his mob lawyer to use, you understand?
back from the dead?
couldn't risk my family's safety.
what we got?
nothing. No matches on prints, DNA,dental...clothing is custom no labels.
nothing in his pockets but knifes and lint.
no name, no other alias. -- Go home, Gordon.
that clown we'll keep till morning, go get some rest, you gonna need it.
tomorrow, you take the big job.
you don't have any say in the matter, Commissioner Gordon.
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety
what's up fat bastard? -- I don't feel good.
you're a cop killer, you're lucky to be feeling anything below the neck!
Please!!! -- Step away from the bars. -- My insides hurt.
did Batman save you, Daddy?
actually this time...I saved him.
has he said anything yet?
evening ...erm..."commissioner."
Harvey Dent never made it home. -- Of course not.
what did you done with him? -- Me?
I was right here.
who do you leave him with? Hmm?
your people?
assuming of course, they are still "your" people, and not Maroni's.
does it depress you? Commissioner
to know, just how alone you really are?
does it make you feel responsible for Harvey Dent's current predicament? -- Where is he?
what's the time? -- What difference does that make?
depending on the time, he maybe in one spot, or several.
if we are going to play games
I'm gotta need a cup of coffee.
Ah, the good cop, bad cop routine?
not exactly.
never start with the head, the victim get all fuzzy, he can't feel the next
see? -- You wanted me, here I am.
I wanted to see what you'd do.
and you didn't disappoint me.
you let five people die.
then, you let Dent take your place.
even to a guy like me, that's cold. -- Where is Dent?
those Mob fools want you gone, so they can get back to the way things were.
but I know the truth, there's no going back.
you've changed things...Forever. -- Then why do you want to kill me?
I don't want to kill you. What would I do without you?
go back to a rip 'em off mob dealers? No, no.
no, no. You...you complete me.
you're garbage, you kill for money. -- Don't talk like one of them. You are not!
even if you'd like to be.
to them, you're just a freak...like me!
they need you right now.
when they don't, they will cast you out like a leper. See their morals, their code
it's a bad joke.
dropped at the first sign of trouble.
they're only as good as the World allows them to be.
I'll show you, when the chips are down
these...err...these civilized people, they'll eat each other.
see, I'm not a monster.
I'm just ahead of the curve.
where is Dent? -- Have all these rules, you think they'll save you?
he's in control. -- I have one rule.
Oh, then that's the rule you'll have to break to know the truth. -- Which is?
the only sensible way to live in this world is without rules.
and tonight, you're going to break your one rule. -- I'm considering it.
you know there's only minutes left, you're gonna have to play my little game, if you want to save one of them.
them? -- When I threw her out there
I thought you really were Dent. The way you threw yourself after her.
look at you go.
does Harvey know about you and his little bunny
where are they? -- Killing is maybe a choice.
where are they? -- Choose between one life or the other.
your friend, District Attorney or his blushing bride-to-be.
you have nothing, nothing to threaten me.
nothing to deal with all your strength.
don't worry! I'm gonna tell you where they are!
both of them, and that's the point.
you'll have to choose...he's at 250-52 streets and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.
which one are you going after? -- Rachel!
we're going to get Dent!
250-52. Street!
Hello?
anybody hear me?
Hello?
Rachel? -- Harvey.
Oh Harvey, thank God! Are you OK?
I'm alright, I'm in a...I'm in a warehouse, they got me wired to these oil drums.
I am too... Harvey ...
I want...my phone call.
what. -- I wanna...I want my phone call.
that's nice.
how many of your friends have I killed?
I 'm a 20 year man, and I know the difference between punks and the illness reside manners
and a freak like you, would just enjoy it.
you killed 6 of my friends. -- 6?
please, my insides hurt. -- I don't really care, back away!
boss said that he'd make the voices go away.
he said he'd go inside and replace them with bright lights
like Christmas! -- You're out of your mind pal, back off!
medic make way to the holding tank! Come on. Get the door open! -- You guys back off!
listen. We don't have a lot of time.
he told me that only one of us is gonna make it
and that they're gonna let our friends choose.
OK, Rachel
it's gonna be fine, it's gonna be alright, they're coming for you.
OK, listen to me, I'll help you, just talk me. Talk me through what's going on with you.
can you find something, anything sharp? -- I'm trying.
what? Harvey?
Harvey, what's happening?
all available units converge to 250-52 street.
do you want to know...why I use a knife?
guns are too quick, you can't savor all the little emotions.
you ...you see, in their last moments
people show you who they really are.
so in a way, I know you friends better than you ever did!
would you like to know which of them are cowards?
what's that? -- Jesus!
he's got some kind of...contusion.
I know you're gonna enjoy this.
I'm gonna have to try enjoy it, even more.
let him go! -- Drop the weapon now!
just shoot him! -- Let him go now! Drop the weapon on floor now!
what do you want?
I just want my phone call.
what...What...What's happening?
just talk to me for just one second.
alright. -- Come here.
is that a ... Phone?
move the car!!!
Harvey, just in case...I wanna tell you something, OK?
don't think like that, Rachel, they're coming for you. -- I know they are, but I don't want them to.
I don't want to live without you and I do have an answer for you.
my answer is yes.
No! No! No, Not me!
Why're you coming to me? No!
Rachel! Rachel!
Harvey ...
OK. -- Rachel!
Harvey, it's ok. It's alright. Listen, some
No! -- Rachel!
hello there.
back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.
with Lau?
the Joker plan to be caught.
he wanted me to lock him up in the MCU.
dear Bruce.
I need to be honest and clear.
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.
I love him and I wanna spend the rest of my life with him.
when I told you that if Gotham no longer needed Batman
we could be together, I meant it.
but now I'm sure that the day won't come when you no longer need Batman.
I hope it does.
and if it does, I will be there
but as your friend.
I'm sorry, Harvey.
I'm sorry to let you down
if you lose your faith in me, please keep your faith in people
love, now and always. Rachel.
I prepared a little breakfast.
very well then. -- Alfred.
Yes, Master Wayne?
did I bring this on her?
I was meant to inspire good, not madness, not death
you have inspired good, but you spat in faces of Gotham's criminals
didn't you think there might be some casualties?
things are always gonna get worse before they got better.
but Rachel, Alfred? -- Rachel believed in what you stood for.
what we stand for. Gotham needs you.
no, Gotham needs its true hero
and I let that murderer, sycophancy blow him half to hell.
which is why, for now you gonna have to make do with you.
she was gonna wait for me, Alfred.
dent doesn't know, he can never know.
what's that? -- It can wait.
that bandit, in the forest in Burma
did you catch him? -- Yes.
how? -- We burned the forest down.
he's a credible source and M. N.A. lawyer for the prestigious counsultancy.
he said he's waited as long as he can for the Batman to do the right thing.
and now he's taking matters into his own hands.
we'll be live at 5 with the true identity of the Batman.
I am sorry about Rachel.
the doctor says you are in agonizing pain, but you won't accept medication
that you're refusing to accept skin grafts
remember that name you all had for me when I was at Internal Affairs
what was it, Gordon? -- Harvey ...
say it...
say it!
two Face...Harvey Two Face ...
why should I hide who I am?
I know you try to warn me. I am sorry.
Wuertz picked you up, is he working for them?
do you know who picked up Rachel?
Harvey, I need to know which of my men I could trust.
why would you listen to me now?
I am sorry, Harvey.
no, no you're not.
not yet.
this craziness ...it's too much...
you should have thought about that before you and the clown out of the box.
you want him?
I can tell you where he'll be this afternoon.
not so crazy as you look! -- I told you, I'm a man of my word.
Where's the Italian?
all tactical units will converge on the location in 20 minutes.
I want auxiliary units to cover all possible get away routes.
wait! Joker man, what you do with all your money?
you see, I'm a guy with simple taste.
I enjoy err...Dynamite,Gunpowder and Gasoline!
what the ...
and you know the thing that they have in common?
they are Cheap.
I want to know how much they are paying you to say who Batman really is
this is our chance! I want Lau alive, the Joker...either way.
hey Jim, get a look at this! -- Let's take the next caller.
Harvey Dent didn't want to give in to this maniac. You think you're better than him?
I think that if we could talk to Dent today, he may feel differently.
and we wish him a speedy recovery... God knows, we need him now.
you said you were a man of your word. -- Oh, I am.
I'm only burning my half.
all you care about is money.
this town deserves a better class criminal.
I'm gonna give it to them.
tell your men they work for me now. This is my city.
they won't work for a freak! -- A Freak?
why don't we cut you up into little pieces and feed you to your pooches, hmm?
and then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog really is!
it's not about money...it's about sending a message...
everything burns.
who is this? -- I had a vision of a world without Batman.
the Mob ground down a little profit, and the police tried to shut them down, one block at a time
and it was so...boring. I'd have a change of heart.
I don't want Mr. Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun?
let's give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese
isn't dead in 60 minutes, then I'll blow up a hospital.
I want you to call every officer, tell them to head their nearest hospital start evac and search!
call the transit authorities, school board, prisons... Get every available bus down to a hospital!
the priority, is Gotham General!
wheel everybody out of that place right now! You, you and you, you come with me.
where are we going, Sir? -- To get Reese.
I need you plugged in, checking Gordon's men and their families.
looking for? -- Hospital Admissions.
will you be wanting the Bat Pod, Sir? -- In the middle of day, Alfred?
not very subtle. -- The Lamborghini then.
much more subtle.
excuse me, let me through. Excuse me, ok.
sir, could you help, please?
I'll go find a bus for him.
sir, Commissioner, do you really think ordinary citizen will try to kill this man?
get the cars around back!
go, keep walking.
I see O'Brian, Richards...
no immediate family member admited to a Gotham Hospital.
they are trying to kill me. -- Oh, maybe Batman can save you.
Davis, I've got space. Bring him out.
Davis!
I saw Burnes and Zachary?
nothing on them. -- And a patrolman I don't know.
so what now? What do we do now? Where are we going?
send the information to Gordon.
get out of here.
Davis!
ma'am, we gonna have to move him now.
it's Berg, is it? -- Commissioner.
you OK, son?
Hah...Hi.
you know ...
I don't want there to be any hard feelings between us, Harvey.
when you and err ... -- Rachel!
Rachel were being abducted, I was sitting in Gordon's cage.
I ... I didn't rig those charges. -- Your man, your plan.
do I really look like a guy with a plan?
you know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars.
I won't know what to do, even if I caught it.
you know I just "do" things.
the Mob has plans, the cops have plans, Gordon got plans
you know, they are schemers.
schemers trying to control their little worlds.
I'm not a schemer. I try to show the schemers
how pathetic, their attempts to control things really are.
so when I say ... uh, come here.
when I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal
you know that I'm telling the truth.
I'm gonna need your weapon. -- What?
why, because my wife's in the hospital? -- Yeah, that'll be why.
it's the schemers, that put you where you are.
you were a schemer, you had plans
And...look where it got you
the police force are taking every possible precaution urging everyone not to take matters into their own hands.
I just did what I do best
I took your little plan and I turn it on itself
look what I did, to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets?
know what? You know what I noticed?
nobody panics when things go according to plan.
even if the plan is horrifying.
if tomorrow I tell the press that like a gangbanger will get shot
or a truck load of soldiers will be blowing up
nobody panics, because it's all part of the plan.
but when I say that one, little old Mayor will die
well then everyone loses their minds!
introduce a little anarchy.
upset the established order
and everything becomes ... Chaos.
I'm an agent of Chaos.
Oh and you know the thing about Chaos?
it's fair.
you live. -- Mm hmm?
you die!
now we're talking.
Mr. Reese?
it's Mr. Wayne, huh? That's a very brave thing you did.
trying to catch the light? -- Were you...you weren't protecting the van?
Why? Who's in it?
well, you think I should go to the hospital? -- You don't watch a whole lot of news do you, Mr. Wayne?
south East... its Gotham General.
did you clear the building? -- Yeah.
we must know how they were inside, you've got patients with roll calls!
sir, right now we're showing 50 people missing, one bus.
are these all the buses we're heading off to other hospitals?
my guess is, we missed one. -- Yeah? Well where your guess about Harvey Dent is?
keep looking! And keep it to yourself! Anybody ask, we got him out!
get me the Mayor Office on the line, we gonna need a national guard.
people are still missing, including GCN's own, Mike Engel
I'm now being told that we're cutting to a video GCN has just received.
I am Mike Engel, for Gotham Tonight. What is it take to make you people want to join in?
you fail to kill the lawyer. I've gotta get you off the bench and into the game.
come nightfall, the city is mine.
and anyone left here plays by my rule.
Mr. Fox, security has showing up break in at the R&D Department.
if you don't wanna be in the game, get out now.
but the bridge and tunnel crowd are sure for surprise. Haha Haha
sweet Jesus.
shouldn't you be out there... You know, doing something?
it's my day off.
I gotta take a leak. Keep an eye up for me, will you?
now what? You need someone to shake it for ya? -- Hello!
Dent? Jesus, I thought you was dead! -- Half.
who picked up Rachel, Wuertz? -- Must be Maroni's men.
shut up!
are you telling me that you're gonna protect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?
I don't know! He never told me! Listen Dent
I swear to God, I didn't know what they were gonna do to you!
that's funny, because I don't know what's gonna happen to you either.
beautiful, isn't it?
beautiful, unethical, dangerous.
you've turn every cell phone in Gotham into a microphone.
and high frequency generator receiver.
you took my sonar concept, and applied it to every phone in the city!
with half the city feeding you sonar, you can image all of Gotham.
this is wrong. -- I've got to find this man, Lucius.
at what cost? -- The database is null-key encrypted.
it can be only access by one person. -- There is too much power for one person.
that's why I gave it to you, only you can use it.
spying on 30 million people isn't part of my job description.
this is an audio sample. If he talks within range of any phone in the city
you can triangulate his position. -- I'll help you this one time
but consider this my resignation. As long as this machine is at Wayne Enterprises
I won't be. -- When you finish
type in your name.
my officers are going over every inch of the tunnels and bridges. But with the Joker's threat -- They're not an option. -- Land route east?
backed up for hours. Which leaves the ferries with 30 thousand, ready to board.
plus I'm gonna use the ferry so I can get some of those prisoners off the island.
the men you intend put away, those are people I'm worried about. -- You should be.
whatever the Joker's planning, its a good bet that Harvey's prisoners might be involved.
I want to get them out of here.
so where is Harvey? -- We haven't found him.
Oh Jesus.
how long can you keep this quiet?
don't stop for lights, cops, nothing!
going to join your wife?
you love her? -- Yes.
you ever imagine what it'd be like to listen her die?
look, take it up with the Joker. He killed your woman.
he made you ... like this. -- The Joker's just a mad dog.
I want whoever let him off the leash.
I took care of Wuertz, but who's your other man inside Gordon's unit
who picked up Rachel? Must have been someone she trusted.
look, if I tell you...you let me go?
it can't hurt your chances.
it was Ramirez.
but you said... -- I just said it could hurt your chances.
you're a lucky man.
but he's not. -- Who?
your driver.
hey man! That ain't right! We should be on that boat!
you wanna ride across with them? Be my guest!
sir, they've stopped their engines. -- Right, get on the radio
tell 'em we'll come back and pick 'em up once we dumped the scumbags.
liberty, this is Spirit, come in. -- What the heck was that?
fox, there's something going on the ferries.
get down to the engine room now.
captain, there're hundred barrels down there ready to blow, and this...
Oh My God! -- Looks like some kind of detonator.
why would they give us the detonator to our own bomb?
tonight, you're all gonna be a part of the social experiment.
I'm ready right now to blow you all sky high
liberty come in, over?
it's dead. -- Anyone tends to get off their boat, you all die.
I'm zeroing in. -- Each of you has a remote
blow up the other boat -- -- The voice is on the ferry, but
it's not the source
west.
Gordon. -- I have the Joker's location.
Prewitt building, assemble on the building opposite.
at midnight, I blow you all up, if however
one of you presses the button, I'll let that boat live
so, who's it gonna be? Harvey Dent's most wanted scumbag
collection or the sweet and innocent civilians?
you choose. Oh!
and you might wanna decide quickly because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.
stay back! -- What and...who are you to decide?
we ought to talk this over, at least. -- We would all have to die?
those men had their chance. -- We are not going to talk about this.
why aren't we talking about? -- We're talking over the same exact thing on the other boat.
let's put it to a vote. -- Yes!!!
barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.
Jim needs you to pack up and put the kids in the car right away.
but there're units outside. -- Those cops can't be trusted.
Jim needs you away from them, as soon as possible!
I'll call them off for 10 minutes, and you'll have to move fast!
Where...where am I suppose to take them? -- 250-52 street.
be there as soon as the patrol car pulls out. -- OK!
she believe you? Because she trusts you!
just like Rachel did!
I didn't know what they were gonna -- -- Didn't know what they gonna do!
you're the second cop to say that to me.
what exactly did you think they were gonna do? -- They got me early on, my mother's hospital bills
don't! -- I am sorry.
live to fight another day, officer.
we found the missing hospital bus. -- Then we have a hostage situation.
this is a shooting gallery. Why would he chooses spot with such good windows?
we have clear shots on five clowns.
snipers take them out, smashed the windows, a team repels in
a team moves in by the stairwells, two, three casualties max.
let's do it. -- It's not that simple, with the Joker, it never is.
what simple is that every second we don't take him, those people on the ferries get closer to blowing
that won't happen! -- Then he'll blow both of them up!
we do not have time for paper -- -- I want everybody
to put their votes on this piece of paper.
if anyone's got pen, pass it along.
we need to get these voting quickly.
I need 5 minutes alone. -- NO! There's no time!
we have clear shots! Dent is in there with them, We have to save Dent!
I have to save Dent!
get ready!
two minutes. Then we breach.
fox, I need picture.
Jim, we're in trouble!
OK, we got POV on Alpha
omni on Beta.
looks like clowns and hostages are on two floors.
the SWAT team on stair way.
another SWAT team on the roof.
dives clear!
barbara, calm down. -- He has the kids!
Hello, Jim. -- Harvey ...
Where's my family? -- Where my family died.
blue team, acquire the target.
entry team, take the charge.
fox, the SWATs are targeting the wrong people! The clowns are hostages!
red team go, Red team go!
keep moving, go!
don't move.
take the shot.
those SWATs are coming in now. -- Clowns, put down your guns!
doctors get down! -- We're ready to fire! Drop your weapons!
Freeze! Stay in there and you
look up! See those bad guys on the floor above?
they're waiting for ambush the SWAT team coming up the elevator.
60 seconds.
here it is, 140 against 396 vote.
so go ahead! Do it!
we are still here
and that means they haven't kill us yet either.
go, go, go!
touble on the floor above.
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot!
we will shoot you, drop the officer! Please drop the officer
on your knees! -- We got him. He's out of the game.
step away from the edge!
stay down! Don't move!
be advice, clowns are hostages, doctors are targets
Ah, you made it! I'm so proud! -- Where's the detonator!
go get him!
no move!
you don't want to die, but you don't know how to take a life.
give it to me
these men would kill you and take it anyway.
no one wants to get their hands dirty?
fine! I'll do it.
those men on that boat, they made their choices
they chose to murder and steal
don't make any sense, for us to die too.
all the old familiar places.
standby.
red team, all secured hostages are safe!
give it to me.
you can tell them, I took it by force.
give it to me, and I'd do what you should did
ten minutes ago.
we really should stop this fighting, otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.
there won't be any fireworks.
and here we...GO!
what were you trying to prove?
that deep down, everyone is as psycho as you? You are alone.
can't rely on anyone these days, you gonna do everything yourself, don't we?
that's ok, I came prepared.
it's a funny world we live in, Speaking of it, you know how I got these scars?
no, but I know how you got these!
Oh...you...you just couldn't let me go, could you?
this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immoveable object.
You...truly are incorruptable, aren't you?
you won't kill me, out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness
and I won't kill you,
because you're just too much fun.
I think you and I, are destined to do this forever.
you'll be in a padded cell forever. -- Maybe we could share one?
then we'll be doubling up the rate this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.
this city, just showed you
that its full of people, ready to believe in good!
until their spirit breaks completely
until they get a good look at the real Harvey Dent
and all the heroic things he's done.
you didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul in a fist fight with you?
you need an ace in the hole
mine is Harvey. -- What did you do?
I took Gotham's White Knight
and I brought him down to our level
it wasn't hard. You see madness, as you know
is ... like gravity.
all it takes, is a little push!
dent!
this is where they brought her, Gordon. Have your man handed her over.
this is where she died. -- I know, I was here.
trying to save her. -- But you didn't
I couldn't. -- Yes, you can have...if you had listened to me.
if you stood up against corruption, instead of doing your deal with the devil.
I was trying to fight the Mob!
you wouldn't dare try to justify yourself if you knew what I'd lost!
have you ever had to talk to the person you love most, tell them its gonna be alright
when you know it's NOT.
well, you're about to know what that feels like, Gordon.
then, you can look me in the eye, and tell me you're sorry!
you're not going to hurt my family... -- No.
just the person you love most!
so, is it your wife?
put the gun down, Harvey... Harvey, put down the gun...
please, Harvey. Please! Oh God!
God damn it, will you stop pointing that gun at my family!
No! -- We have a winner.
no, Jim! Stop it!
Harvey! Harvey!! -- Don't let him
I am sorry!
for Everything!
please don't hurt my son.
you brought your cops? -- All they know is there's a situation
they don't know who or what, they're just creating a perimeter.
you think I want to escape from these? There is no escape from these!
you don't want to hurt the boy, Harvey.
it's not about what I want, it's about what's FAIR!
you thought we could be decent men, in an indecent time?
then you were wrong, the world is cruel
the only morality in a cruel world, is chance.
unbiased, unprejudiced...Fair!
his son's got the same chance she had. 50 - 50
what happened to Rachel wasn't chance. We decide to act. We three!
then why was it me, who is the only one who lost everything!
you wasn't. -- The Joker chose me.
because you were the best of us! He wanted to prove
that even someone as good as you, could fall!
and he was right. -- You're the one pulling the gun, Harvey.
so point it at the people responsible...
fair enough.
you first.
my turn.
Harvey, you're right.
Rachel's death was my fault.
please don't punish the boy
please punish me. -- We about to.
tell your boy it's gonna be alright, Gordon.
lie, like I lied.
it's going to be alright, son.
dad, Daddy, is he OK?
thank you. -- You don't have to thank me.
Yes, I do.
the Joker won.
Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for
undone.
whatever chance you gave us of fixing our city, dies with Harvey's reputation.
we bet it all on him
the Joker took the best of us and tore him down.
people will lose hope -- -- They won't.
they must never know what he did. -- 5 dead
2 of them cops, you can't sweep that off.
but the Joker cannot win.
Gotham needs its true hero.
no ... -- You either die a hero
or you live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I can do those things because I'm not a hero, unlike Dent.
I killed those people. That's what I can be. -- No, no, you can't. You are not
a hero. Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed.
nothing less than a knight... shining.
they'll hunt you. -- You'll hunt me
you'll condemn me
set the dogs on me
because that's what needs to happen.
because sometimes the truth isn't good enough.
sometimes people deserve more.
sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.
Batman?
Batman!
why is he running, Dad?
because we have to chase him. -- OK, we're going in! Go, go! Move!
he didn't do anything wrong.
because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now
so we'll hunt him
because he can take it
because he's not our hero
he's a silent guardian
a watchful protector
a Dark Knight.
three of a kind, let's do this. -- That's it? Three guys?
two guys on the roof. Every guy gets his share, 5 shares, its plenty!
six shares, don't forget the guy who planned the job.
he think he can sit it out and still take a slice. I know why they call him the Joker.
so, why did they call him the Joker?
I heard he wears make up. -- Make up?
Yeah, to scare people. You know, war paint.
alright everybody! Hands up! Heads down!
I said hands up heads down!
let's go pal, I'm making a withdraw here.
I said hands up! --No!
here comes the silent alarm.
and there it goes. -- Heads down!
alright, let's just get her out with me.
and just staying down here!
that's funny, it didn't dial out to 911 it was trying to reach a private number.
is it a problem? -- No, I'm done here.
sit down! Down!
I just said down here!
obviously we don't want you doing anything with your hands...
others than holding on to you life!
on to the ground! Stay on the ground! Nobody makes a move!
nobody! Stay down!
do you have any ideas who you are stealing from? You and your friends are dead!
he's out? Right?
where did you learn to count?
they wired this thing up about 5000-volt. What kind of bank does that?
mob bank. I guess the Joker is as crazy as they say.
Where's the alarm guy? -- Boss told me when the guy was done
I should take him out. One less share, right?
funny, he told me something similar. -- He wha-- NO! NO!
that's a lot of money. If this Joker guy was so smart he'd had us bring a bigger car.
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me soon as we loaded the cash.
Ah---No, no, no, no. I kill the bus driver.
bus driver?
what bus driver?
school's up. Time to go. Cop's not getting up, is he?
that's alot of money.
what happen to the rest of the guy?
think you're smart, huh?
whoever that have hired you
they'll just do the same to you.
Uh...criminals in this town used to believe in things.
honour, respect ... Look at you!
what do you believe in, huh? What do you believe in!
I believe, whatever doesn't kill you, simply makes you stranger.
mr Mayor, you were elected in the campaign to clean up the city
when are you going to start? -- On my guard, I believe I already have.
but this so-call, Batman. We heard he is doing some good, the criminals are running scared
but I say... -- No mate, not tonight.
what are you, superstitious? You got more chance winning the powerballs than running into him!
it works, Mayor says you're closing in on the Batman.
the investigation is on-going.
Batman Suspects
ever intending to see your wife again Lieutenant?
I thought you had to go look after you mother, detective.
I checked her back into the hospital. -- I am sorry.
so he hasn't shown up? -- I hope he doesn't.
I like reminding everybody that he's out there.
why won't he come? -- Hopefully
because he's busy.
that's why we bring--Dogs.
look what your drugs did to my customers.
buyer beware. I told you my compound would take you to places.
I never said they'd be places you wanted to go.
but this is repeat customers!
you don't like what I have to offer. You can buy from someone else.
assuming Batman left anyone to buy from.
my dogs are hungry!
pity there's only one of you.
that's not him.
that's more like it.
don't let me find you out here again. -- We're trying to help you!
I don't need help! -- Not my diagnoses.
what gives you the right? What's the difference between you and me?
I'm not wearing hockey pads.
can't resist showing us his face.
what's he hiding under that make up?
err, can we get a minute, people please?
him again? or the others?
another bunch of small timers.
some of the mark bills I gave you. -- My detectives have been making drug buys with them for weeks.
this bank puts another drug for the mobs, that makes 5.
we found the vault of their dirty cash. -- Time to move in.
we'll have to hit all banks, simultaneously... Swat teams, backups
what about this Joker guy? -- One man, or the entire mob?
he can wait. -- Well the new DA hears about this.
he wants in. -- Do you trust him?
it will be hard to keep an eye, I hear he's as stubborn as you are...
Wayne Enterprise Private Property No Trespassing
it'll be nice when Wayne Manors rebuilt.
you can swap not sleeping in the penhouse, to not sleeping in the mansion.
whenever you stitch yourself up
you do make a bloody mess. -- Yeah. It makes me learn from my mistakes.
you ought to be pretty knowledgable by now then.
my armor, carried too much weight. Need to be...need to be faster.
I'm sure Mr Fox can applied.
did you get mauled by a tiger? -- It was a dog.
huh? -- It was a big dog.
more copycats last night, Alfred. With guns.
why don't you hired them and take the weekend off?
that wasn't exactly what I had in mind, when I said I wanted to inspire people.
I know. But things had been improved.
look at the new district attorney!
I am, closely. Need to know if he can be trusted.
are you interested in his character? Or his...social circle?
who Rachel spends her time with is her business.
I trust you don't have me followed on my day off?
if you ever took one I might.
know your limits, Master Wayne. -- Batman has no limits.
well you do sir. -- Well, can't afford to know them.
and what's gonna happened on the days that you find out?
we all know how much you like to say "I told you so.
on that day Master Wayne, even I won't want to...Probably.
sorry I'm late folks.
where were you? -- Aren't you dare to step up?
Harvey, I know these briefs backwards. -- Well then, fair is fair.
heads I'll take it and tails is all yours.
Oh yeah, you wanna flip the coin to see who leads?
it's my father's lucky coin! As a recall, it got me my first date with you.
I won't leave something like that up to chance.
I don't. I make my own Luck.
all raise. Judge Surrillo presiding.
I thought the DA just play golfs with the Mayor, things like that?
tea off's one thrity. More than enough time to put you away your life, Sally.
with Carmine Falcone in Arkham, someone must have step up to run the so-call "family"?
is that man in this courtroom today?
could you identify him for us please? -- You win counsellor.
it was me.
I have a sworn statement
from you, that this man, Salvatore Maroni.
is the new head of the Falconey Crime Family. -- Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization. -- Orders!
permission to treat the witnesses hostile -- Granted.
hostile? I'll show you hostile!
Carbon-Fibre, 28 caliber, made in China.
if you wanna kill a public servant, Mr Maroni, I recommend you buy American.
get him out of here. -- You honor, I'm not done.
we'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni, so we wont be able to charge him
but the fact they're trying to kill you means we're getting to them.
I'm glad you're so pleased Rachel. I'm fine, by the way.
come on Harvey, you got those DA. If you're not getting shot at, you're not doing your job right?
you said you had rashes, you could take the rest of your day off.
I can't. Dragonhood in Major Crime is getting down here.
Oh Jim Gordon? He's a friend actually. Try to be nice.
I hear you get a hell of a right cross?
Its...its ashame Sals going walk.
yeah well good thing about the Mob is they keep you and your second chances.
lightly radiated bills.
fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?
I liaise with various agents. -- Save it Gordon, I want to meet him.
official policy is to arrest the vigilante Batman onsight.
then what about that flip light on top of MCU? -- If you got problems with malfunction equipments
I suggest that you take them out to alignment, counsellor.
I put every new money launderer in Gotham behind bars but the mob's still getting its money out.
I think you and your friend, had found the last game in town and you're trying to hit them where it hurts.
their wallets, its bold.
you gonna count me in? -- Well this town the fewer people know something, the safer the operation.
Gordon, I don't like that you got your own special unit.
and I don't like it is full of cops, are investigated in the internal affairs.
if I didn't work with cops you investigated, like you're making your name in I. A. I'd be working alone.
I don't get political points from being an idealist. I have to do the best I can with what I have.
you want me to back warrants for searching procedures on five banks without telling what we're after?
I can give you the names of the banks. -- Well, that's a start.
I'll get you your warrants, but i want your trusts.
Oh you don't have to sell me that Sir. We all know you're Gotham's White Knight.
yeah well, I heard they have a different name for me down in MCU.
I won't know about that.
in China, now security investment stands for dynamic new growth.
the joint Chinese venture will win enterprises, will be a powerhouse.
well Mr Lau, I speak for the rest of the board
and Mr Wayne, in expressing our own excitement.
sir, I know that Mr Wayne is curious about how's trust fund gets replenish, but
frankly, this is embarrassing. -- You worry about the due dilligence, Mr Reese.
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.
its done. It...the numbers are solid. -- Do them again.
wouldn't want the trust fund to run out now, would we?
another long night? This joint venture was your idea. My consultant loves it.
but I'm not convinced. Lau's company had gone by 8% annually like clockwork.
his revenue stream must be off the books. Maybe even Illegal.
OK, cancel the deal. -- You already knew?
just needed a closer look at their books.
need anything else you can trouble me for? -- I need a new suit.
Yeah, 3 buttons is a lil 90's Mr Wayne. -- I am not talking about fashion, Mr Fox,
I want these functions. -- You want to be able to turn your head.
sure make the backdown the driveway easier. -- I'll see what I can do.
took me 3 weeks to get reservation here, and I had to tell 'em I work for the government.
Really? -- This city's health inspector isn't afraid to pull strings.
Rachel, fancy that. -- Yeah Bruce, fancy that.
Rachel, Natasha. Natasha, Rachel.
Natasha, are you ...the... -- Premier Ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.
wow, Harvey's taking me next week. -- Really, so you're into ballet?
Bruce, this is Harvey Dent. -- The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel told me everything about you. -- I surely hope not.
so, let's put a couple of tables together. -- I'm not sure that they'll let us.
well, they should. I own the place.
how could you want to raise children in a city like this?
well, I was raise here, it turn out ok.
is Wayne Manor in the city limits?
the policies? -- Sure.
you know, as the new DA you might want to figure out the...where your jurisdiction ends.
I am talking about the kind of city that idolizes the masked vigilianty.
Gotham City is proud of the ordinary citizens standing up for whats right.
Gotham needs hero like you, elected official
not the man who thinks he's above the law. -- Exactly.
who appointed the Batman? -- We did!
all of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city.
but this is a democracy, Harvey. -- When the enemies were at the gates
the Romans will suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city.
it wasn't considered honour, it was considered a Public Service.
Harvey, the last man that they appointed to protect their republic was name Caesar
and he never give up his power. -- Ok, fine.
you either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become a villain.
look, whoever the Batman is he doesn't want to do this for the rest of his life. How could he?
Batman is looking for someone to take up his man-talk.
someone like you, Mr Dent?
maybe, if I'm up to it.
what if Harvey Dent is the "Kid Crusader"?
if I were sneaking out every nights, someone would have noticed by now.
well, I'm sold, Dent. I'm gonna throw you a fund-raiser.
that's nice of you Bruce, but I'm not up pre-election for 3 years.
no, you don't understand. One fundraiser with my pals
you'll never need another cent.
what the hell is this?
as you all aware, one of our deposits was stolen.
a relatively small amount...68 million.
who stupid enough, steal from us?
2 big white chap, wears some cheap purple suit and make up
enough of the problem, he's nobody.
the problem is -- our money being tracked by the cops.
thanks to Mr. Maroni's well placed sources
we know that police have indeed identified our banks using marked bills
end up planning to seize your funds, today.
and since the enthusiastic new DA has put all my competitors out of business
I am your only option. -- So what do you propose?
moving all deposits to one secure location, not a bank.
where then? -- No one can know but me.
if the police were to give pressure on one of you, everyone's money would be extend.
what stops them getting to you? -- I go to Hong Kong
far from Dent's jurisdiction, and the Chinese will not extradite one of their own.
how soon you move the money? -- I already have.
for obvious reasons, I couldn't wait for your permission.
rest assured, your money is -- safe.
and I thought my jokes were bad.
gimme one reason why I shouldn't have my boys here pull ur head off.
how about a magic trick?
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.
T'da!! It's ... gone!
Oh and by the way, the suit it wasn't cheap, you all'd know, you bought it.
that's it! -- I want to hear proposition.
let's wind the clocks back a year.
these cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you...
Ermm I mean...What happened? Your...Your balls drop off? Hmm?
you see, a guy like me... -- Freak!
guy like me... Look, listen!
I know why you choose to have your little group therapy sessions in broad daylight.
I know why you're afraid to go out at night.
the Batman.
you see Batman has shown Gotham your true colors, unfortunately
Dent? He's just the beginning.
and as for the television so call "plan"
Batman has no jurisdiction. He'll find him and make him squeal!
I know the squealers when I see them...And
what do you propose? -- It's simple, we...kill the Batman.
if it's so simple, why haven't you done it already?
if you're good at something, never do it for free.
and what you want?
Err...Half.
you are crazy. -- I'm not.
no, I'm not.
if we don't deal with this...now
soon little.err...Gambol here, won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma.
enough from the Clown!
let's not blow this out of propotion.
you think you can steal from us and just walk away? -- Yeah?
I'm putting a word out -- 500 grant for this clown, dead.
a million alive, so that I can teach him some manners first.
alright, so listen...why don't you give me a call when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously.
here's my card.
you're a hard man to reach.
Lau's half way to Hong Kong.
if you'd asked, I could have taken his passport. I told you to keep me in the loot.
all that was left in the vaults were marked bills.
they knew we were coming! As soon as you office get involve
my office? You're sitting down there with scums like Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking?
Oh yeah Gordon, I almost had your rookie called on the racketeering beat.
don't trying cloud the fact that clearly Maroni's got people in your office, Dent!
we need Lau back
but the Chinese won't extradite international under any circumstances.
if I get him to you, can you get him to talk?
I'll get him to sing. -- Look, if we going after the mob's life-savings
things will get ugly. -- I knew the risks when i took this job, lieutenant.
how you get him back in
he does that.
our chinese friend left town before I could tell him the deal was off.
I'm sure that you've always wanted to go to Hong Kong.
what's wrong with Hong Kong?
I think Mr. Lau deserves a more... personal teaching.
now for high altitude jobs, you gonna need oxygen and stabilizers.
well I must say I'm afraid your "usual" requests
jumping out of an aeroplane, is pretty straightforward.
then what about getting back into the plane?
I'd recommend a good travel agent. -- Without the landing.
now that's more like it, Mr Wayne.
the CIA had a program back in the 60's for getting their people out of hot-spots call "Sky-Hook."
you can look into that.
Yeah. -- Ok.
now.
hardened kevlar plates on a titanium-dipped fiber
for flexibility you'll be lighter, faster, more agile.
perhaps you should read the instructions first. -- Yeah.
now there is a tradeoff, seperation of the plates makes you more vulnerable to knifes and gunfire.
Ah, we won't wanna leave things too easy now, would we?
how well they hold up against dogs?
we're talking Rottweilers or Chihuahuas?
should do fine against cats.
I found one in Arizona.
that very nice man said that he could have it up and running in a week and he takes cash.
what about the flight crew? -- Star cruise smugglers.
they run flight to the Pyongyang below radar the whole way.
did you think they may hop by? -- Oh yes.
love Boat: Billionaire Asconds With Entire Russian Ballet.

you look tired, Alfred. You'll be alright without me?
you can tell me the Russian for apply your own bloody sun shine lotion.
yo Gambol, somebody here for you. They said they've just killed the Joker.
they brought the body?
so, the dead, that's 500
How're about a live? Hmm?
you wanna know how I got these scars?
my father was...a drinker
and a fiend.
then one night, he goes off crazier than usual
mummy gets the kitchen knife and defends herself
he doesn't like that, Not-One-Bit
so, me watching
he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it
he turns to me, and he says
why so serious, son?
he comes at me with a knife
why so serious, son?
sticks the blade in my mouth.
let's put a smile on that face!
and...
why so serious?
now. Our organization is small
but, there is a lot of potential for aggressive expansion.
so which of you fine gentleman would like to join our team?
Oh, there is only one spot open right now so we gonna have try outs!
try outs!
make it fast.
welcome to Hong Kong, Mr Fox. Mr Lau regrets he hasn't able to reach you in person today.
I understand.
for security purposes, I'm gonna have to ask you to check in your mobile.
of course.
I must appologize for leaving Gotham in the middle of our negotiations
there's a misunderstanding with the Gotham police force
I couldn't let such a thing threaten my company. -- Of course.
a business man of your stature will understand, and
with you here now, we can continue.
well I do appreciate you bringing me out here in such style Mr. Lau, but I really
we do not allow cell phones in here. -- Sorry, forget I had it.
no, I really came to tell you that our business deal has to be put on hold
you see, we can't afford to be seeing to do business with
whatever it is you're accused for being...I'm sure a business man of your stature will understand.
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call might have sufficed.
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think that he was deliberately wasting your time.
just accidentally wasting it.
that's very good, Mr. Lau. Accidentally. Very good.
Hi, Sir.
got better view from the peak tram.
how is the view from LSA holdings? -- Restricted.
lau has been holding up good and tight. -- What is this?
I had R&D work it out. Send out a high frequency pulse
with pulse that response back, for mapping an environment.
sonar. Just like a-- -- Submarine, Mr Wayne. Like a submarine.
and other device? -- It's in place.
Mr. Wayne. Good luck.
OK, very well.
hmm? Why the lights go on and off?
go check it out.
this is the lobby, can you hear me?
where are the cops? -- They are on their way.
we paid them for such slow service?
let me go! Let me go! Nooooo! I'll give you anything, let me go!
hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire!!!
please deliver to: Lieutenant Gordon.
look, give us the money and we'll talk about making a deal.
the money is the only reason I'm still alive.
Oh you mean, when they find out that you helped us, they will gonna kill you?
are you threatening my client? -- No, I'm just assuming your client's cooperation with this investigation
can solve everything. No?
OK, enjoy your time in county, Mr. Lau.
wait. I won't give you the money
but I will give you my clients, All of them.
you were glorified accountant.
what could you possibly had on all of them, that we could charge?
I'm good with calculation, I handle all their investments.
one - Big - Pot.
got it! -- One minute.
Rico. If they pool their money, we can charge them all as one criminal conspiracy.
charge them what?
in a Rico case if you can charge one of the conspirals with authority, you can
charge all of them, that's Great!
mr Lau.
what kind of details, do you have about this communal fund?
ledger? Notes-- -- Ammunity, protection and a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
after you testify in open court, and I'm just curious...with all you clients locked up
what's gonna happen with all that money?
like I said, I'm good with calculation.
he can't go to county.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells. -- What is this Gordon, your fortress?
well, you trust them over county?
I don't trust them here.
lau stays.
well I don't know about Mr Lau's travel arrangements
but I'm sure glad he's back.
put words out, we're hiring the Clown.
he was right, we have to fix real problem
Batman.
I'm not aware of any participation by the Batman
our boy looks good on you-tube.
you sure you wanna embarras me in front of my friends, lieutenant?
don't you worry, they're coming too.
have a nice trip, see you next fall. -- 712 counts of extortion,
849 counts of racketeery, 246 counts of fraud
87 counts of conspiracy and murders...
527 counts of extraction of justice. How do the defendants pleed?
order in court. -- 549 criminals at once.
how did you convince Surrillo to hear this farce?
she shares my enthusiasm for justice, after all she is a judge.
well even if you blow enough smoke to get convictions out of Surrillo
you're gonna set a record in the appeal, for quickest tick in the ass.
it won't matter. The head guy makes bail, sure. But the middle level guy, they can't.
they can't afford to be off the street long enough to trial appeal, they'll cut deals include in jail time
think about what you can do with 18 months of clean streets.
mr Mayor, you can't-- -- Now get out, both of you.
sit down.
public wise, that's the only reason that this might fly
but that means its on you. They all gonna come after you now.
and not just the Mobs, Politicians, Journalists, Cops ...
anyone's wallet who about to get lighter.
are you up to it? You better be...
cause they get anything on you
and those criminals are back on the streets, followed strictly by you and me.
I think your fundraiser will be a great success, Sir.
and why do you think I wanna hold a party for Harvey Dent?
well I assume it was your usual ways to socialition beyond myself and the scums of Gotham's underbelly.
good try to impress Miss Dawes. -- You are very drawl.
alfred you're wrong, it's actually...it's Dent.
the image is disturbing. -- Tell them your name.
Brian...Ouch...
are you the real Batman? -- No.
no? Then why do you dress up like him?
he is a symbol, so we don't have to afraid of scum like you.
Yeah, you do Brian. You Really do.
so you think, Batman makes Gotham a better place?
look at me, look at me!
you see this is how crazy Batman makes Gotham.
you want order in Gotham.
Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in.
Oh and everyday he doesn't, people will die.
starting tonight.
I'm a man of my word.
Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld. Scares to his death by the trust fund brigade.
Rachel ... -- Little liquid courage, Mr Dent?
Alfred, right? -- That's right, Sir.
Rachel talks about you all the time. You known her her whole life.
Oh not yet, Sir.
any psychotic ex-boyfriend I should be aware of? -- Oh, you have no idea...
I'm sorry that I'm late. I'm glad to see that you all got started without me
now, where...is Harvey?
where ... Harvey Dent, man of the hour.
more is Rachel Dawes. She is my oldest friend. Come here.
you know when Rachel first told me that she was dating Harvey Dent, I have one thing to say
the guy from these all over campaign commercials? "I believe in Harvey Dent" Ya, nice slogan, Harvey.
but, you got Rachel's attention. And then I started to pay attention to Harvey.
and all that he's been doing, as our new DA, and you know what?
I believe in Harvey Dent. I believe that on his watch
Gotham can feel a little safer, a little more optimistic
look at this face. This is the face of Gotham's bright future.
to Harvey Dent. Let's cheer it for him.
Harvey may not know you well enough to understand when you're making fun of him, but I do.
no, I meant every word.
you know that day when you first told me about that Gotham will no longer need Batman
it's coming -- You can't ask me to wait for that.
it's happening now. Harvery, is that hero.
he locked up half of the city's criminals, and he did it without wearing a mask.
Gotham needs a hero with a face.
good throw of party, Wayne. I'll give you that.
thanks again.
mind if I borrow Rachel?
lieutenant, that joker card pinned to the body, forensics found 3 subs of DNA
any matches? -- All three. The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb. -- The Joker is telling us he is targeting them.
get a unit over to Surrillo's house. Tell Wuertz to find Dent.
get them both to protect the custody. Where is the Commissioner?
city Hall. -- Seal the building
no one in or out until I get there! -- I got it!
Gordon! What are you up to?
Secure...I want a floor by floor search of the entire building.
sorry Sir, we believe the Joker's made a threat against your life.
these are dangerous people, Judge. -- Yeah, but you're not giving me enough information
even we don't know where you're going. Take the envelope, get in, open it
it will tell you where you're heading.
you can not leave me alone with these people. -- The whole Mobs are after you, and you're worry about these guys?- Yeah, but compare to these the Mob doesn't scare me.
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this for yourself, so
take my word. Police Commissioner under a lot of threats
I found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago.
think cunning for you makes you see things clearly. -- Yeah, I bet.
Yeah, it makes you think, about things you couldn't stand losing
about who you wanna spend the rest of your life with. -- It's pretty big commitment.
well, the Mobs has their way.
you got to explain to my wife, why I'm late for dinner, Lieutenant.
sir, the Joker card had traces of your DNA on it
don't do that. -- Alright.
must be serious then. -- Ok.
what's your answer?
I don't have an answer.
how did he get my DNA? -- Somebody with access to your office or your house must have left the
tissue, glass... Wait! Wait!
well I guess no answer is a "No." -- Harvey ...
is someone else, isn't it? -- Harvey ...
just tell me it's not Wayne, that guy is a complete
what are you doing?
get a medic!!!
they're coming for him.
we made it!
stay in.
good evening, ladies and gentleman.
we are...tonight's entertainment.
I only have one question.
where is Harvey Dent?
you know where Harvey is? Do you know who he is?
hands up, freak boy.
do you know where I can find Harvey? I need to talk to him about something
just something, a lil, huh? NO.
what's going on out there? Wayne!
Oh thank god you've got a panic room. -- Hey, wait!
Oh, you gotta be kidding.
you know, I'll settle for his love ones. -- We are not intimidated by thugs.
you know
you remind me of my father.
I hate my father. -- OK, Stop!
well, Hello~ Beautiful~
you must be Harvey's squeeze, hmm?
and you are beautiful.
well you look nervous, issit the scars?
you wanna know how I got them?
come here, here! Oh come here!
so I had a wife, a beautiful, like you
who tells me, I worried too much
who tells me, I ought to smile more
who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks
one day they carved her face. We got no money for surgeries
she can't take it.
I just want to see her smile again.
I just want her to know I don't care about the scars, So
I stick a razor into my mouth, and did this
to myself. And you know what???
she can't stand a sight of me!
she leaves. Now I see the funny side.
now I'm always smiling.
a little fight in you
I like that. -- Then you gonna love me!
drop the gun.
Oh sure, you just take off your little mask and show us all who you really are. Hmm?
let her go. -- Very poor choice of word.
are you alright?
let's not do that again.
is Harvey ok? -- He is safe.
thank you.
Jim, it's over. -- As long as they don't get to Lau
we cut off their funds. -- The prosecution is over
nobody is standing up infront of the judge while judges and police commissioners are getting blown away.
what about Dent? -- He's got any sense, Dent's half way to Mexico
so where do you keep your trash?
you have court
if your life're long enough to get you into record. -- You can't protect me.
you can't even protect yourself. -- You refuse to cooperate, you're not coming back here, you go to county.
how long you calculate you'll last in there?
targeting me won't get their money back
I knew that the Mob won't go down without a fight, but this is different.
they've cross the line. -- You cross the line first
sir, you squeeze them, you hammered them to the point of desperation
and in their desperation, they turned to a man they didn't fully understand.
criminals aren't complicated, Alfred. We just need to figure out what he's after.
with respect, Master Wayne. Perhaps this is the man you don't fully understand, either.
a long ago, I was in Burma, my friends and I were working for the local government.
they were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders by bribing them with precious stones.
but their their caravans were being raided in the forest north of Rangoon by bandit.
so we went looking for the stones.
but in six months, we never meet anyone who traded with them.
one day, I saw a child playing with a ruby the size of a tangerine.
the bandit had been throwing them away.
so why steal them? -- Well, because he thought it was good sports? Because
some man, aren't looking for anything logical, like money
they can't be bought, bullied, reasons or negotiate with
some man, just want to watch the world burnt.
... lincoln orchards, you'll find Harvey Dent there.
check their names.
richard Dent.
Patrick Harvey. -- Harvey Dent.
I need 10 minutes of the scene before your men containminate it.
us containminate it? It's because of you these guys are dead! -- Detective!
that's brick underneath, you wanna take ballistic of a shattered bullet?
no.
fingerprints.
well whatever you gonna do, do it fast.
because we found his next target
he's putting it in tomorrow's paper.
I'm not sure you made it loud enough, Sir?
what can I do for you, Mr Reese?
you want me to do the dilligence from the LSA holdings deals again?
well, I found some irregularities. -- Their CEO is in police custody?
no, not with their numbers, with yours.
applied Sciences, whole division of Wayne Enterprises just...disappeared, overnight.
I went down to the archives and I started point some old files.
you wanna tell me you didn't recognize your baby out there pancaking cop cars in the evening news.
now, you got the entire R&D Department burning your cash claiming, err
it's related to the cell phones for the army? What are you building for him now?
Err...Rocket ship?
I want 10 million dollars, a year, for the rest of my life.
let me get this straight.
you think that your client
one of the wealthiest, most powerful man in the world is secretly a vigilante
who spends his night beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands
and your plan, is to blackmail this person?
good luck.
keep that.
this is your original scan.
here it is, re-engineered.
and there's the thumb print he left when he push it around in the clip.
I'll get you a copy. Uh, Mr Wayne
did you reassign R&D? -- Yeah.
government Telecomunnication Projects. -- I wasn't aware we had any government contracts.
OK Lucius, I'm playing this one pretty close to the chest
fair enough.
with no word from the batman, even as they moan commissioner loeb, these cops have to be wondering
the Joker will make good on his threat in orbituary column of the Gotham Times
to kill the Mayor.
I've checked all the databases, there are four possibles.
cross refrences the addresses. Look for park side.
overlooking the parade.
I've got one, Melvin White.
1502 Rendalf Apartments.
angry vein in the soul, moved to Arkahm twice.
what do you got on the roof? -- We're tight, but frankly there's alot of windows up here.
commissioner Loeb, dedicated his life to law enforcement
and to the protection of his community.
I remember when I first took off, and I asked him if he wanted to stay on his commissioner, and
he said he would, provided I kept my vow
clearly he's not a man who meants word, no shit he had been.
number of policies that he had acted as commissioners
were unpopular, policies had flooded my office with angry calls and letter
who is this? -- What happened?
he took our guns and ...uniforms.
we must remember that vigilantes is the price of safety.
stand by. Honoured! Guard! All attention! Halt!
forward! Halt!
ready! Aim! Fire!!! Ready! Aim! Fire!!!
stay down, don't move!
Mr. Mayor! Get him out of here!
I'll see you later. -- Why are you going back!
get out of here!
tell me what you know about the Joker.
no!... -- I am sorry about that.
Jimmy, go find your sister. Go ahead!
if there's anything we can do, anything you need, we're here for you.
you brought this crazy disorder, you did! You brought this.
switch it off, he ain't coming.
he does not want to talk to us.
God help whoever he does wanna talk to.
can we go some place quieter?
can you, Salvatore? -- What makes you think I wanna hear you talk?
what?
yeah? Ok. Harvey, where are you? -- Where are you?
I'm where you should be, at major crime. I'm dealing with all these mess
can I have the fingerprint analysis? -- Rachel, Rachel, Listen to me. You're not safe there.
Oh, this is Gordon's unit. -- Gordon's gone Rachel -- He vouch for these men. -- And he's gone.
the Joker's name you next. God if there's someone. or anyone in this town we can trust.
Bruce...we can trust Bruce Wayne.
no, Rachel come on, I know you... -- Harvey, trust me.
Bruce's penhouse now is the safest in the city.
then you go straight there. You don't tell anybody where you're going and I'll find you there. I Love you.
I want the Joker.
from one professional to another. If you're trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot.
from this height, the fall wouldn't kill me. -- I'm counting on it.
where is he? -- I don't know. Always is he found us.
he must have friends. -- Friends? You met this guy?
someone knows where he is. -- Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.
there're ways to your act. You got rules, the Joker, he got no rules.
nobody's gonna cross him to you. You want this guy, you got one way
but you already know what that is. Just take off that mask, let him come finds you.
are you going to let a couple more people getting kill while you make up your mind?
you wanna play games?
how's that feel? -- You won't.
I would!
you don't think I will? You don't think I will?
no, no I won't.
that's why I'm not gonna leave it up to me.
heads, you gotta keep your head
tails...not so lucky.
so, you wanna tell me about the Joker?
let's go again. -- I don't know anything! I don't!
you're not playing the answer, friend.
let's do it again.
it's legal leave a life to chance? -- Not exactly.
his name is Jeff Thomas. He's a Paranoid Schizophrenic.
former patient of Arkham, the kind of mind the Joker attracts, what do you expect to learn from him?
joker killed Gordon. He's gonna kill Rachel.
you are the symbol of hope, I can never be.
you stand against organized crime as the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham in decades
if anyone saw this, everything will be undone
all the criminals you pulled off the streets will be released and Jim Gordon would have died for nothing.
you gonna hold a press conference tomorrow morning. -- Why?
no one else will die because of me, Gotham is in your hands now.
you can't! You can't give in!
you can't give in!!!
Harvey called. He says Batman gonna turns himself in.
I have no choice. -- You honestly think that's gonna keep the Joker from killing people?
maybe not, but I have enough bloods on my hands
and I see now, what I will have to become to stop man like him.
you once told me that if the day came, when I was finished, then we'd be together.
Bruce, don't make me your one hope for a normal life.
did you mean it?
Yes.
Bruce.
if you turn yourself in, they're not gonna let us be together.
logs as well? -- Everything.
anything that can lead back to Lucius or Rachel.
people are dying, Alfred. What would you have me do?
endure, Master Wayne.
take it, they'll hate you for it. But that's the point of Batman.
he can be the outcast. He can make the choice, that no one else can make
the right choice. -- Well, today I found out what Batman can't do
he can't endure these. Today you get to say:"I told you so.
today I...I don't want to.
but I'll do bloody tell you.
I suppose they're gonna lock me up as well, ...as your accomplice.
accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.
ladies and getlemen, thank you for coming. I've call this press conference for two reasons.
firstly to show the citizens of Gotham, that everything that can be done over the Joker killing is being done.
secondly, is the Batman offers to turn himself in.
but first let's consider a situation.
should we give in to this terrorist demand? Do we really think that if
you'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante than the lifes of the citizens?
the Batman is an outlaw
but that's not why we're demanding he turn himself in, we're doing it because we're scare.
we've been happy to let the Batman clean up ours streets for us until now.
things are worse than ever! -- Yeah! Yeah!
Yes, they are.
the night is dark just before the dawn.
I promise you...the dawn is coming.
one day, the Batman will have to answer to the law he's broken
but to us, not to this mad man.
no more dead cops! -- Yeah! Yeah!
he should turn himself in!
so be it. Take the Batman into custody.
I am the Batman.
[Man 2] Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts.
the first part is called " the pledge. "
the magician shows you something ordinary.
a deck of cards, a bird or a man.
he shows you this object.
perhaps he asks you to inspect it, to see that it is indeed real, unaltered, normal.
but, of course, it probably isn't.
where do you think you're going?
l'm part of the bloody act, you fool.
the second act is called " the turn. "
the magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary.
now you're looking for the secret, but you won't find it, because, of course, you're not really looking.
you don't really want to know.
you want to be... fooled.
but you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear isn't enough.
you have to bring it back.
that's why every magic trick has a third act.
the hardest part.
the part we call...
... " the prestige. "
[Man] The prestige? And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer, get to that final part of his trick that night?
no, sir. Something went wrong. - What went wrong?
l saw someone making their way below stage.
l followed him.
lt was Borden, watching Mr. Angier drown.
would you please describe your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter.
l'm an ingénieur, l design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for performing them.
so, Mr. Cutter, was this water-filled tank beneath the stage part of Mr. Angier's illusion?
no. The tank was brought on for the first trick and then taken offstage.
Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the end of it.
how large was this tank?
lt's a normal tank for escape under water, about 400 or 500 gallons.
how do you think he was able to move the tank under the trap door without anyone noticing?
he's a magician, ask him. - [laughing]
[Man] l ask again, would this man explain the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion.
the Real Transported Man is one of the most sought after illusions in this business.
l have the right to sell it on.
lf l reveal the method here, the trick is worthless.
how can we know that the tank wasn't simply some part of the trick that went wrong?
Mr. Cutter, l see your predicament.
but Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance.
lf you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private, l might be able to judge their relevance to the case.
might this be an acceptable compromise?
[Guard] l'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets.
not my idea, sir. The warden saw his show in Manchester last year where he vanished into thin air.
he's convinced he'll try and escape.
l told him the only way Borden's going to disappear is if l leave him out there with the other inmates.
check the locks...
...twice.
my name is Owens.
l'm a solicitor.
l represent Lord Caldlow, an accomplished amateur magician and...
[Borden] How much?
he is interested... - How much for my tricks?
five thousand pounds.
talk to Fallon, my ingénieur. Money's for him.
Yes, l did. He offered to sell me your tricks.
all except the most valuable one, The Transported Man.
well, l won't forgive myself for selling my greatest trick.
even for your daughter?
lf you are for the drop, your daughter is going to need looking after.
Fallon will take care of her.
perfect, Fallon.
a man with a past as obscure as your own.
the courts have motioned she be removed from his care. She will be an orphan.
l know you're no stranger to the workhouse.
lt's better than here?
l'm offering you a way to wrap up your affairs with dignity.
l'm offering your daughter a future.
as Lord Caldlow's ward, she will want for nothing...
well, think it over.
and Lord Caldlow would like you to have this, as a show of good faith. lt might be of interest.
robert Angier's diary, including the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick.
he never learned it. - Really?
on his return, he mounted a version of The Transported Man that the papers said was better even than your original.
lf you want Angier's secrets, you go dig him up and ask him yourself.
l want your secret, Mr. Borden.
consider your daughter.
[Angier] A cipher, an enigma...
...a search, a search for answers.
even if Colorado is the end of my journey, it'll take much longer to unravel the rest of Borden's secrets.
see, the cipher in his notebook is unlocked by a single word, but it will still take months to translate his writing.
and to know his mind.
well, my passion is equal to the task.
[Man] Mr. Angier, welcome to Colorado Springs.
the whole town has electricity. - Yes, sir.
well...
...quite a reception.
you're our first guest of the season, Mr. Angier.
your telegram didn't indicate how long you'd be staying with us.
as long as it takes.
l will need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain.
well, the peak's closed, sir.
for scientific experimentation.
Yes, l know.
that's why l'm here.
[Driver] You'll have to walk the rest, l'm afraid, sir.
[Man] l'm amazed how many of you newspaper writers can't read my sign.
not the welcome l was expecting.
l know you.
you're the Great Danton.
l saw your show in London.
seven times you guessed every object the audience had in their pockets.
l'm Alley. Sorry about the fence. People keep interfering with our work.
l've come to see Tesla. - Why?
he made a machine for a colleague of mine some time ago.
can you get me a meeting with him? - lmpossible, l'm afraid.
l've brought a lot of money.
l'm sorry, Mr. Angier.
l simply can't help.
l'll be staying at the hotel, indefinitely.
Hey, what am l holding?
your watch.
[Angier] Borden's journal entry for April 3, 1897, describes a show at the Orpheum Theatre.
that was just days after he first met me.
[Borden] We were two young men at the start of a great career, two young men devoted to an illusion, two young men who never intended to hurt anyone.
[Man] Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?
[Man] Me!
lf you would tie her wrists, bind her feet...around the ankle.
are either of you two gentlemen sailors?
no. - No.
l'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.
he's complacent, he's predictable, he's boring.
milton has gotten success, whatever that means, so now he's scared. He won't take any risks at all.
he's squandering the goodwill of his audience with tired, second-rate tricks... - They're all favorites.
give me something fresh. He won't even try a bloody bullet catch.
a bullet catch is suicide.
all it takes is some smartass volunteer to put a button in the barrel.
use a plant. - You can't for every trick.
no seats left for the punters.
all right, no bullet catch, whatever, but the point is a real magician tries to invent something new that other magicians will scratch their heads over.
then you sell it to him for a small fortune.
what? - l suppose you have such a trick?
l sure do. - Would you care to sell it to me?
no. No one else can do my trick.
any trick can be duplicated. - Wrong.
lf Mr.Borden has invented his masterpiece, he's prepared to do it.
milton is a showman, but Borden is right, he won't get his hands dirty.
lf you want to see what it takes to make real magic, go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman there and he really has what it takes.
chung Ling Soo. - l can't afford that.
l know the bloke run the door.
you two go and see that show, and whichever one of you can tell me how he does the goldfish bowl trick gets the prize.
which is? - Ten minutes onstage with my old friend, Mr. Ackerman.
Really? - Who's Ackerman?
the top theatrical agent in London.
l saw you drop the knot again. - [woman] l turned my wrists.
some nights you just don't get it, do you?
l mean, if that knot slips and Julia's on the hoist, she'll break her leg.
lt's the wrong knot.
like l said, the Langford double will hold tighter.
the Langford double isn't a wet knot. lt's too dangerous.
lf the rope swells, she can't slip it.
l can slip a Langford underwater. - We can practice.
Borden, he said no. - Oh, you know knots better than me?
listen, no more mistakes.
all right. Yeah? Do you? You want to take over?
just leave. - l didn't think so.
Hey, Cutter, where's he from?
where are you from? He shifts props for Virgil at the hall.
worried he'll steal your tricks? - Doesn't deal in methods.
how do you know? - Because l hired him to find out how Virgil does the orange trick.
l don't trust him. - He's a natural magician.
course you can't trust him.
l think he's all right.
you think everyone's all right. - Even you.
watch your sightlines. lf l can see you kiss your wife's leg every night, so can the blokes at the ends of rows three and four!
[Angier] You're wrong. lt can't be.
look at the man. - This is the trick.
this is the performance. Right here.
this is why no one can detect his method.
total devotion to his art.
a lot of self-sacrifice.
you know.
lt's the only way to escape...all this, you know?
l can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water.
or fish, look.
l don't know. Hang on a second.
he must be strong as an ox.
he's been pretending to be a cripple for years.
any time he's in public, any time he goes out. lt's unthinkable.
Borden saw it at once. But l couldn't fathom it.
living my whole life pretending to be someone else.
you are pretending.
l don't think changing a name compares.
not your name. Who you are and where you're from.
l promised l wouldn't embarrass my family with my theatrical endeavors.
l thought of a name for you.
the Great Danton. - [chuckles]
do you like it? But it's sophisticated.
lt's French.
[Angier] Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic.
but what does he know of self-sacrifice?
you bloody fool.
[Whimpering] He killed it. - lt's OK.
he killed it. - He didn't.
look, now he'll bring it back.
no, he killed it. - No, he didn't.
look, see, he's all right. He's fine.
look at him. - But where's his brother?
he's a sharp lad, your son.
Oh, he's my nephew.
Ah.
you're the lucky one today.
are you watching closely?
look closer.
never show anyone.
they'll beg you and flatter you for the secret, but as soon as you give it up, you'll be nothing to them.
you understand? Nothing.
the secret impresses no one.
the trick you use it for is everything.
well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.
you're welcome.
Alfred, it's Alfred.
so l could use a cup of tea.
l can't allow... lt's the landlord. lt's not...
you think that's... ls that enough to keep me out?
[Chuckling] l think so.
so l'll see you again?
milk and sugar?
what's in there?
Angier's machine.
you built this, Mr. Cutter?
Oh, no, sir. This wasn't built by a magician.
this was built by a wizard.
a man who can actually do what magicians pretend to do.
tell me, Your Honor, what happens with these things after the trial?
they've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.
an avid collector, very interested in the case.
Yeah. Well, don't let him take this.
why ever not? - lt's too dangerous.
l'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's got a simple and disappointing trick.
the most disappointing of all, sir.
lt has no trick.
lt's real.
this is the tank Angier drowned in?
Yes.
this is the...
...place where the performer's hand reaches through to the trick padlock.
a standard magical apparatus for escapes?
Yeah, with one important difference.
this isn't a trick lock.
lt's been switched for a real one.
what a way to kill someone.
they're magicians, Your Honor.
Showmen, men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths, to amaze, to shock.
even without an audience?
there was an audience.
you see, this water tank was of particular significance to these two men.
particularly awful significance.
[Milton] Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?
lf you would tie her wrists, bind her feet around the ankle.
are either of you gentlemen sailors? - No.
l'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.
no, no.
[Cutter] l knew an old sailor once.
they told me he went overboard, tangled in the sails.
they pulled him out, but it took him five minutes to cough.
he said it was like...going home.
what do you want, Borden?
l'm sorry for your loss, Angier.
which knot did you tie?
l keep asking myself that.
And? - And...
l'm sorry, l just don't know.
you don't know?
l'm sorry.
you don't know?
you don't know?!
Alfred? - Good news. We got our first booking.
l don't think we've had the pleasure.
Mr. Fallon is my ingénieur. - Where did you get all...?
l had to borrow and... don't ask. - He's a very enterprising soul is... is Mr. Fallon. So...
we can't afford to pay him. - The money will come with the audience.
but what about until then? What l earn, it's barely enough for us.
don't worry about it. l'll share half my food with him or something.
you're going to be doing that with someone else.
no. You're...
having a baby.
Oh, my God.
we should have told Fallon. That is great.
Oh, come here.
Alfred, what is this?
Oh, this is just the trick to work Ackerman up at the end of my act.
ls it the masterpiece, the great trick?
no, no, no, the world is not ready for that one yet.
this is just your run-of-the-mill, daring, spectacular bullet catch.
a bullet catch. - Yeah, but it's safe.
l promise. Look.
shoot me. - Shoot you?
go on, shoot me.
right there. - No, l can't.
no, no, not there. Shoot me here. Don't...
[Laughs] - How's that?
that's very good. Tell me how you do it.
no, l can't do that.
well, then you can't do it. - l can't do it?
l'm sorry, but l can't raise a child on my own.
you don't tell anybody that l told you.
OK. - Gunpowder.
wadding.
then the bullet.
ramrod.
hold out your hand.
the bullet is not even in the gun when the charge is fired.
once you know, it's actually very obvious.
well, l mean, you still get...
lt's dangerous.
people still get killed doing that. - How?
you get some smartass who could put a penny or a button or, God forbid, Sarah, somebody could put a bullet down there.
don't worry. Don't worry, because l'm not gonna let anything happen.
everything's gonna be all right because...
...l love you very much.
say it again. - l love you.
not today. - What?
well, some days it's not true, and today you don't mean it.
maybe today you're more in love with magic than me.
l like being able to tell the difference.
lt makes the days it is true mean something.
all right.
[Borden] Metal rings, ladies and gentlemen.
lf there are any ladies and gentlemen here.
solid metal. - [man] Seen that already.
who threw that?
this is what you came for, is it?
so...
...who wants to volunteer?
[Man] l do! - [man 2] Me!
me.
me.
are you man enough, sir?
Yes.
which knot did you tie, Borden?
which knot did you tie, Borden?
l don't know.
[Borden] He came in to demand an answer, and I told him the truth.
that I have fought with myself over that night, one half of me swearing blind that I tied a simple slipknot, the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double.
I can never know for sure.
how can he not know!
[Angier] How can he not know?
he must know what he did.
he must.
Sarah, that bloody hurts.
l don't understand how it can be bleeding again.
lt's as bad as the day it happened.
we have to get a doctor back. - We can't afford the doctor back.
you've woken her. - Great.
l'm sorry, l need this to heal so l can get back to work.
you've got to face things. What tricks can you perform with this injury?
l can do car pulls. l can do some prop tricks.
l can still do that. l can do the trick l've been telling you about.
the one that they're gonna remember me for.
come on.
l never thought l'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass.
hasn't stopped your looking.
heard about a booking. Nice little theater.
young, up-and-coming magician. - Who?
you. - Me? Booking? Why?
l want to keep on working.
who's going to hire the ingénieur that killed Julia McCullough in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?
someone who knows it wasn't your fault.
someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.
l hear he had a spot of bad luck catching a bullet south of the river.
that's a dangerous trick, that one.
we'll have to whitewash the windows, confound the more curious members of the public, but it will do.
we should see about an assistant. - l've made some arrangements.
you settled on a name?
Yes, l have.
the Great Danton.
lt's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?
no, it's sophisticated.
the birdcage can't be our climax. Everybody knows it.
not like this. - l don't want to kill doves.
then stay off the stage.
you're a magician, not a wizard.
you got to get your hands dirty, if you're going to achieve the impossible.
ln here, Miss Wenscombe.
no point in meeting Mr. Angier if you don't fit. On the right.
what's so hard about this? - Nothing.
you're going... down here.
and this will conceal, right? - Oh, sure.
tighten up on there. - Yep.
OK.
this ties up here?
ties in the back. - Good.
breathe as little as possible.
now, you see?
that's it. - OK.
she's not experienced, but she knows how to present herself.
a pretty assistant is the most effective form of misdirection.
thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, for my final trick, l will require the assistance of two volunteers.
Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?
Yep.
under? - Under, yeah.
come around his foot.
careful. - lt's all right.
your volunteer, put their hand there. - Yeah?
and another one here.
lf you'll place your hands on either side of the cage, please.
thank you, Olivia.
you best not be intending to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.
of course not. - Ready? Right.
one... - Two...
three.
that's bloody marvelous, Cutter.
very nice.
and the best part is...
l thought you said l had to get my hands dirty.
someday, perhaps you will.
l just had to know that you can.
very nice. Very nice, indeed.
l haven't had the chance to compliment you on your beautiful theater.
lt'll be a lot more beautiful when it's full.
don't worry.
you all say that. Why should l worry?
lf your tricks don't get them in, somebody else's will.
maybe somebody willing to do a bullet catch or a water escape?
cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.
people hoping for an accident, likely to see one too.
what would that do for your business?
[Chuckling] You got a week, John.
thank you, Mr. Merrit. - [chuckles]
thank you.
uh... Sir, in the third row there.
please stand up and show us your handkerchief.
[Laughter] - This isn't mine.
perhaps you'd return it to the lady in the aisle of the second row.
l believe she has yours.
l'm sorry. l'm so sorry. l'm making so many mistakes. l'm so nervous.
the audience doesn't seem to be responding.
they've seen a lot of tricks before, but not this next one.
cloth over.
keep your fingers crossed.
l'll have the champagne ready.
you've seen this one before? - [man] We've seen them all before.
l'll make it a little harder then, shall l?
two volunteers, please. A lady and a gentlemen.
to hold this cage with me.
l'll perform this feat in a manner never before seen by yourselves or any other audience anywhere in the world.
Madame, place one hand on the back of the cage, one hand on the front.
sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage one hand on the top.
l should've spotted him. - You had a lot of plates going.
don't suppose we can do this again. - No.
so, what's the climax of our show? - Show?
you don't have a show. - We have a week's engagement.
to perform magic, not butcher birds and break my customers' fingers.
clear out, anything here in the morning gets burned.
Mr. Merrit... - lt's done, John.
l've hired a comedian. You know l hate comedians.
[Cutter] Well, there's plenty of good theaters.
lf we can come up with a new trick, - change the name of the act. - The name stays.
right, well, then the new trick's gonna have to be irresistible then.
l have a couple of methods to try out.
and then we need a new angle on the presentation.
and if you need some inspiration, there's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week.
engineers, scientists, you know?
that sort of thing captures the public's imagination.
mind if l join you? Tesla sends me down here during the storms.
perfect excuse to come join the Great Danton for a drink.
two of them.
beautiful, isn't it? God, l miss New York, though.
why are you here? - The lightning lives here.
and not much else.
our work is secret.
that a cipher?
a rotating transposition that shifts every day of the diary.
simple but time-consuming to translate, even with the five-letter keyword.
which is?
we magicians have a circle of trust.
you have a circle of trust with someone whose diary you stole?
maybe l bought it.
and you're hoping to find a great secret in there?
l've already found it.
that's why l'm here.
tesla built one for another magician.
why would you want the same thing?
call it a professional rivalry.
Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people.
but he would never talk about it. - l understand discretion.
l just want the machine.
finish your drink.
l want to show you something. l think you'll have a special appreciation for our work.
l thought it was a secret. - You're a magician.
who's gonna believe you?
not long now.
our equipment requires a great deal of current.
tesla electrified the whole town in exchange for using the generators when we need them.
we do our tests when the townspeople are asleep.
Mr. Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone.
where are the wires?
exactly.
Where's the generator?
you saw it last week.
that must be ten miles from here. - Fifteen.
and l have to ride all of them before l get to bed.
l'll send word for you in a few days, Mr. Angier.
[Angier] Magic. Real magic.
[Man] Now appearing, only here at London's Royal Albert Hall, one of the miracles of our age.
a technological marvel. You've never seen anything like it in your lives.
your eyes will not believe what they're witnessing.
the miracle of Nikola Tesla, ladies and gentlemen.
free, clean power. Like to know the future?
the man who's speaking right now is going to change the world.
come one, come all. lmmediate seating, no waiting.
ladies and gentlemen, objections have been raised...
they should be raised. Does that look safe to you?
part of Thomas Edison's smear campaign against Mr. Tesla's superior alternating current.
[Man] We have asked Mr. Tesla to reconsider.
[Man 2] Which he will not!
but l've been told he refuses to appear under any such restrictions.
[Gasps] - This thing's gonna blow.
ladies and gentlemen, please.
[Borden] Hey.
Hello, Jess.
have you had a nice day with mommy? Huh?
l love you. - See, today it's true.
Yeah. - Hello.
[Angier] I saw happiness.
happiness that should have been mine.
but I was wrong.
his notebook reveals that he never had the life that I envied.
the family life that he craves one minute, he rails against the next, demanding freedom.
his mind... his mind is a divided one.
his soul is restless.
his wife and child, tormented by his fickle and contradictory nature.
so, what do you think you'll call her?
l don't know.
everybody needs a name, so, what's hers?
maybe Sarah.
that's a lovely name. That's a lovely name.
well, you talk about what you want to do for the rest of the day.
all right, go on, you talk with her.
are they taking her away?
to the workhouse?
you keep talking.
tell Owens l've reconsidered. Take it.
go on, take it.
lt's for the best.
let me see.
l'm gonna learn all the professor's secrets.
only if l teach you how to read.
they're just stupid tricks, right?
haven't helped you get out of here, have they?
or can't you undo real locks, professor?
maybe l'm just biding my time.
maybe one day l'll...
...open my hand, get your attention, ask, " Are you watching closely? "
maybe a magic whirl or two.
and then l'll be gone.
how'd you get so famous then?
magic.
Oi! Borden, get back here! - [all laughing]
thank you.
shut up!
Where's the bloody key?!
[Angier] February 8, 1899.
today, finally, a breakthrough.
Tesla's agreed to see me.
perfectly safe.
so this is the Great Danton.
Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions.
hold out other hand.
what's conducting the electricity? - Our bodies, Mr. Angier.
quite capable of conducting and, indeed, producing energy.
have you eaten, Mr. Angier?
[Chuckling] l need something impossible.
you're familiar with the phrase, " Man's reach exceeds his grasp " ?
ls a lie.
man's grasp exceeds his nerve.
society only tolerates one change at a time.
first time l tried to change the world, l was hailed as a visionary.
second time...l was asked politely to retire.
so here l am, enjoying my retirement.
nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive.
lf l were to build for you this machine, you would be presenting it merely as illusion?
well, if people actually believed the things l did on stage, they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.
think of sawing a woman in half.
have you considered the cost of this?
price is not an object.
perhaps not, but have you considered the cost?
l'm not sure l follow.
go home, forget this thing.
l can recognize an obsession.
no good will come of it. - Hasn't good come of your obsessions?
at first, but l have followed them too long.
l am their slave.
and one day, they will choose to destroy me.
lf you understand an obsession, then you know you won't change my mind.
so be it.
will you build it?
l've already begun to build it, Mr. Angier.
l hope you enjoy the mountain air. This will take some time.
uh... l thought you'd gone.
l don't really have anywhere to go.
you've been sleeping here?
cutter said it'd be all right till we get another booking. What are you doing?
uh... research.
part of a magician's job is to... watch his competition, see what illusions...
you're going to do something to that man, aren't you?
cutter's hoping you let things lie.
he says if Borden thinks things are even between you...
even?
my wife for a couple of his fingers?
he has a family now and he's performing again.
Borden is out there living his life just as he intended, as if nothing had happened and look at me.
l'm alone and no theater will touch me.
us.
you're going to need a better disguise.
l need a volunteer.
[Wenscombe] What happened?
did you hurt him?
what happened, Robert?
you, sir. Just a rubber ball, yes?
thank you.
just a rubber ball? No.
not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.
lt's magic.
he had a new trick.
[Wenscombe] Was it good?
lt was the greatest magic trick l've ever seen.
[Angier] Did they applaud when you saw it?
lt was too good. lt was too simple. The audience hardly had time to see it.
he's a dreadful magician. - A wonderful magician.
he's a dreadful showman. He doesn't dress it up, how to sell it. - How does he do it?
he uses a double. - No, it's too simple.
this is a complex illusion.
you say that because you don't know the method.
lt's a double that comes out. lt's the only way.
l've seen him perform it three times. The prestige is the same man.
no, it's not. - The same man comes out of the cabinet.
lt's the same man.
he wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers, but, if you look closely, you can tell.
he doesn't know how to sell it to an audience, but l do.
Yeah, we could use it as a climax to the show.
Yes.
the man stole my life, l'm gonna steal his trick.
we got to find someone who looks like you.
he doesn't use a double. - l don't know how Borden does it.
either... You either wait for him to retire and buy the secret, or you listen to how l would do it.
and the only way that l know how to do it is to find you a bloody good double.
all right.
take a good look. Let's get out there and find me.
Whoo!
look, look.
what's that?
lt's for you. - What's this for?
come.
[Sarah] You...
l asked you last week... - You caught me in a wrong mood.
but you won't ever... - Sarah, l'm gonna have to change my mind, aren't l?
the act is taking off. Soon we'll be in a bigger theater, things will work out.
l can't believe it. Thank you. Thank you. lt's beautiful.
Gerry? - [gasps] Darling, look at you.
Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier, l'd like you to meet Gerald Root.
Mm-hm.
a pleasure. Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.
would you like for me to tell you a little joke? Come here.
Yes. Are you laughing now?
l have to take a piss.
he's out of his mind. - Of course, he's an out-of-work actor.
he's perfect. He needs a little help.
but when l get done with him, he could be your brother.
l don't need him to be my brother, l need him to be me.
give me a month.
so you open the door...
...and...
come on.
couldn't you have found a softer one?
well, it's not for sleeping on.
so, if you come down through there...
...does Root go up through there? - Yep.
lt's going to be amazing.
well, it has to be Borden's trick is getting noticed.
the place was packed today.
you went and saw his show again.
ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?
all l have to do is keep myself stinking drunk, and no one will be able to tell the difference.
have a little faith, sir.
now, would you favor us with a performance, Mr. Root?
you'd drink, too, if you knew the world half as well as l do.
did you think you were unique?
l've been Caesar, l've played Faust.
how difficult could it possibly be to play the Great Danton?
you can go back to being yourself now, Root, for nothing.
l'd rather be him for now.
l find it, uh... amusing.
'my liege, l did deny no prisoners. "
you look wonderful. - Oh, thank you.
root has to keep a low profile. Anyone sees him, the game's up.
l don't know how you do things. l'm not sure l wanna know.
have you thought what we should call it?
there's no point being coy. Borden calls his trick The Transported Man.
ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen may be termed - as illusions or entertaining trifles. - [rimshot]
alas...
...l cannot claim this next feat as illusion.
watch carefully.
you will see no trickery, for no trickery is employed.
merely a technique familiar to certain citizens of the Orient and various holy men of the Himalayas.
lndeed, many of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who are not, do not be alarmed.
what you're about to see is considered safe.
to our achievement.
the manager says he's never seen a reaction like it.
mom was always anxious.
but dad would say..he is a boy, let him go.
he was like a dolphin.
full of energy, full of life.
my mom.
she is very proud of her Portuguese connection.
you know, people used to think she is my elder sister.
you talk to her.
l'll be back in a minute, l'm very hungry.
she's been like this since a child.
offer her food and she'll refuse.
and the she hunts for leftovers in the refrigerator.
this was Nikhil's room.
he set up everything in this room himself.
he made this painting when he was just 8.
he wouldn't let anything touch his things.
this was his space.
my little boy.
my husband Navin did not like my calling him so.
the first l cleaned his potty.
. you can't imagine what my state was.
that day Anita was out and l had to do it.
then l became an expert and l was even better than my wife.
l too was a sport man but had to give....it all up to join my dad's business.
we had an antique furniture store.
l didn't let that happen to Nikhil. l trained him myself.
dad, tell him to come out.
how was that dad?
good, you are doing very well. Now, you can come out.
once more.
come on now, stop showing off. l am very hungry.
okay, Okay l am coming.
sometimes l wonder what went wrong.
he was well brought up.
he was polite, disciplined and well behaved.
we were all very proud of him.
listen, l've to leave now.

'when the moon smiles. "
'when the wind whispers. "
'my presence. "
'.will be with you. "
'when darkness descends. "
'l will bring daylight to you. "
'Waves of memories flood me. "
'we will go where? "
'the earth meets the sky. "
'the soft sound of raindrops. "
'the first day of the monsoon. "
'Warm afternoon. "
'cool evenings. "
'every moment, every season. "
'you will find me with you. "
'every step of the way. "
'let me take you. "
we did everything together.
we had our first glass of wine together.
my first puff of cigarette.
we chocked to death.
Nikhil, you were leading.
what went wrong?
l think you were not focused.
no dad.
l don't know.
l wanted to see if any one was closing in.
I just got distracted that's when things went wrong.
this is why l tell you that you should not be partying.
dad, l haven't partied for the past ten days.
just stop it.
don't . my little boy any mroe
my little boy
you are making a sisi out of him
Sam, let's go for a walk yes, I need it
I hope you're not going out with your good-for-nothing friends
let him go.

God, you never ever stop Do you want some more that gig?
God! The old man is really on my case.
he's just nervous.
you should understand l know, but he too should chill.

ln through one ear and out through the other.
it's easier said than done. Hi guys - Hi handsome
anu you are looking gorgeous
no if only you are older my luck
shall we leave?
okay.
Nigel, drive carefully.
no . OK?
lf Nikhil gets injured, then dad.
Yeah, l know. From to be to not to be.
you know you are lucky.
Really?
lmagine, if dad was as obsessed with me.
.as he is with Nikhil, what would you do?
l would have died.
but how come he spared you?
lucky for me.
Nikhil came along soon after l was born.
well, l owe this one to your brother.
don't you find it strange at our house?
our constant squabbling, teasing and shouting.
everyone is so gentle in your house.
but l like it.
so full of life
OK, enough about family
now, let's talk about. - You and me?
about us?
where did you guys go?
what are you thinking?
sometimes expectations can really be a burden.
what do you mean?
what if l loose again tomorrow?
so what? There are more challenges.
l am sure you will win.
sometimes l get irritated.
as if, dad is trying to live life through me no see anything l want to lead my own life. l have my own plans.
what plans?
do you mean to say you swim for his sake?
you don't want to do it for yourself?
lt is not that.
then what is it?
tell me
some other time.
looks like you had a sleepless night.
honest speaking, this year, I am making the national
uncle, he'll be very disappoint of you
you don't need to worry about uncle.
relax man, I am just joking me also. Hey man, take it easy.
l'm sure you will beat me someday.
not someday, today
I am so scared lf you beat me today, l will throw party for you.
I completely forgot, tomorrow night I'm having a party
you too are invited.
to celebrate my winning
you put in your best today.
l don't know what went wrong, dad.
l was totally focused.
doesn't matter.
the next time, we will thrash him
now give me a hug
now go and change.
l want you to smile when you go for the model.
attention ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely sorry pronouce
due to a simple error there is a change in the result.
telli menses has .second
and the new state swimming champion is Nikhil Kapoor.
this was my victory too.
my dream.
that my champion fulfilled.
Nikhil was standing on the podium.
seeing him there.
none of us slept that night.
so darling what brings you back to Goa?
l want to set up a store in Goa.
and l was missing home and all of you.
how time flies lt seems that yesterday you were this small and now look at you.
where is Sam?
he is always late
he had coaching classes.
you always have an excuse for him.
he is not a loafer like you.
he's a busy man
I have to go in 10 minutes - Oh really?
and Nigel? Wasn't he supposed to come?
he had to go Panjim.
and you always seems to have excuse for him
Nikhil, why don't you show Leena your trophies?
how have you been? - I've been great
like l was four years back.
just a little more handsome, charming and ..and as modest as well
you haven't changed a bit.
so how does it look to be famous?
to tell you the truth, very bad.
but it's my fate.
what can I do?
very funny.
you tell me, how was New York?
new York is good
good, or very good
any hot boyfriend?
no.
Why?
you look okay.
you are reasonably tall.
well, what can l say?
l couldn't forget you.
do you remember?
Gary's party at Geoffery's
Oh that, that was childish nonsense.
not for me.
l missed you so much.
sorry, Sam, Nigel and lunch are all waiting.
l'm really surprised your dad asked me for lunch today.
me too
old man was in a good mood today.
why not?
he has found the right girl for his son.
what nonsense
Yeah, she was eyeing you all night.
just shut up, OK?
come on don't tell me you don't like her.
l can't help it if women fall for me.
modesty, thy name is Nikhil.
dad and uncle had decided years ago to get them married.
Ah, childhood sweethearts reunited.
touching my foot!
l don't plan to marry her.
lets change the topic or l'll leave.
but they are discussing engagements dates.
my engagements, without asking me?
Why? You like her, Don't you?
l told you l don't like her.
I am not interested, is that clear?
then what were you doing in.
tell us Anu, what did you see?
why shouldn't I?
tell me, was that kiss with miss, an accident, or did I imagine it all?
ls that late riser still sleeping?
did you like Leena?
she's nice
not my hair
what happened to you?
what?
the swelling.
Oh, that, just fell out the bike.
l told you, that bike is a curse.
don't start of early in the morning.
what do you think of Leena?
why do l have to think about her?
I think she's growing up to be a fine, and intelligent young woman
she's so respectful towards her elders.
the two of you look really nice together.
don't they make a lovely pair?
can we talk about something else?
Why?
you don't have to feel shy.
you will setting now
at your age l was the father of two of you.
you guys discuss his marriage.
l'm getting late.
teachers can't be late. Unlike you
take this.
don't worry; every one fears commitment initially.
but you'll be very happy!
l am not ready for it yet.
Why? What is the problem?
Nikhil, call from your teen doctor.
have you ever needed a blood transfusion due to an illness?
no doctor, in fact l donate blood myself.
twice a year.
any unsafe sexual practise? I mean.
prostitutes?
what's wrong doctor? Why are you asking me such questions?
whatever you tell me is confidential.
you can talk freely.
think carefully.
no doctor, actually a couple of times.
but it was always with someone l knew.
girlfriends
what is the problem?
can't say for sure, at this point.
tell me something, Nikhil
when you had food poison recently.
what's the matter?
nothing.
you don't want to marry her, right?
so forget it, you don't have to.
l'm with you.
nobody can force you.
Nikhil, what is the matter?
I love you a lot, princess
I love you too, bhai
everything will be okay.
Nikhil, the past six months have been hectic.
l think you should take a break.
break?
but why?
to give some new talent a chance.
you make it sound like l've been here for ten years.
and plus, I am a good form
Nikhil, l know that you are in form, but...it's my request.
please, Nikhil.
try to understand.
Nikhil, you can't go inside.
so when are you leaving for Calcutta?
l might not go for this tour.
Why?
coach was saying that...they want to try out new talent.
what nonsense
how can they drop the best for new talent?
lt's okay dad, l need some rest too.
you have been resting for three weeks now.
dad, let us not argue.
l think it is you who doesn't want to go.
this is the influence of your wayward friends.
and after all the hard work I've put in for you
dad, no one asked you to.
don't you dare speak to me like that
what are you doing here all alone?
just like that.
Why? What is wrong with Mr. handsome, charming. witty Kapoor, today?
nothing.
just thinking.
l see, a penny for your thoughts.
mom and dad have been talking about us.
yes they want us to get engaged.
l think we should do it after the monsoon.
l would like an outdoor party.
what do you say?
what is it?
any problem?
lt was different when we were growing up.
you don't love me
Leena, I like you very much. ls there someone else?
l like you as a friend.
just please leave me alone
what do you think?
ln my opinion they should just get married.
why are you forcing him?
let Nikhil take his own time
think of the devil
where is Leena?
she had to go back.
had to go back?
but she was supposed to have dinner with us.
Nikhil, what is happening?
first you cancel the tour, now.
dad, can we talk about this tomorrow?
l want an answer, right now.
l don't want to get married.
Why?
dad. lf he doesn't want to get married, why are you forcing him?
l'm talking to Nikhil.
but son, Leena such a sweet girl.
mom, when did l say she isn't sweet?
but I just, don't want to get married. l've noticed that you are behaving strangely these days.
are you into drugs or something?
dad, please.
Nikhil, l want to talk to you, let us go.
l don't want to talk.
l'm tired of the daily taunting.
behave youself
there is no need to talk to your dad in a raise voice.
mom, l am not a baby anymore.
please, stop shouting l learnt a lot from this dairy of his.
he had started writing it around that time.
actually I was quite suprised to how beautifully he express him self
reading this, l understood why he misbehaved...with dad that night.
the reason was something else.
there's something terribly wrong with me, Anu
Dr. Mukherjee was telling me.
.That there is some problem in my blood.
he did not say anything clearly.
l went swimming the other day.
every one got out of the pool as soon as they saw me.
l've also been thrown out of the team.
I don't understand problem in your blood?
I'm sure there's some misunderstanding
what did Dr. Mukherjee say?
no one is telling me anything clearly, Anu.
l'm very scared.
l went to the club that day, as l do every Saturday.
to have lunch.
everything seemed perfectly normal
then the waiter asked us to leave.
everyone, except us seemed to know..that Nikhil had AlDS.
at the very club where l went with my head held high...l was asked to leave.
dad.
useless bum, get up.
dad.
you nearly killed your mother when you were born.
and now you wish to kill all of us?
shameless, we cannot face anyone because of you.
dad, let go please.
please don't talk like this, he is your son.
son?
he was my son, not anymore.
he was bleeding.
but l continue to hit him and threw him out of the house.
mom.
you were born prematurely. l wish you had died then.
we wouldn't have had to see this day.
he stood there by my side.
alone, helpless.
and, l myself.
how did l say that to my love?
I killed him myself
I killed him that in myself
his own mother killed him.
l sat and watched as he left home.
he never walked back through the door.
what happened, you are bleeding?
Nikhil, what happened to you?
you have cut your lips. Wait, l'll get some Dettol.
Oh, yes Sam, hi.
Yes, he's here.
what happened man?
you want to come here?
Sam, there's no need. l shall take care.
ask Anu not to worry.
we'll meet tomorrow and talk.
sorry.
ls it burning?
what happened?
did you tell them?
no.
then what?
many things.
forget it. You rest now. We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Nikhil, wake up.
what time is it?
it's 11 o'clock. come on, get up l'll go and get some medicines for you.
have your tea.
listen.
l have to tell you something.
Yes, even l've to speak to you.
first let me get the medicine...than we can sit and chat at length.
see you
what's the problem, lnspector?
what is this? How did you hurt yourself?
l fell down.
you aren't bleeding, are you?
why have l been brought here?
keep your hands away.
why have l been brought here?
you are the state swimming champion, right?
Yes.
you must have had a lot of girls.
we need a list of all the girls you've had sex with.
excuse me?
l want to make a phone call.
didn't l tell you? Don't touch anything.
take him to the hospital.
go and get your medical check up done.
after he was taken away, the whole place had to be washed with Dettol.
duty does not mean we put our lives at risk.
we had to be careful.
why we should we suffer for his mistakes?
when his own father thrown him out, what do you expect us to do?
l sent four constables with him.
just in case he doesn't try to escape.
these days you never know what these boys are up to.
what do you say doctor?
who knows?
these celebrity types do anything.
careful, handle him only with gloves.
l think we should immediately send him to Bombay.
how can we risk our life because of him?
sir, please send him away fast.
all the patients are scared.
this disease never existed in Goa before.
take him away, and keep him locked at the sanatorium.
who did you have fun with?
was it a man or woman or both?
what have the times come to?
he looks healthy.
absolutely normal.
you should be killed.
you have had fun, haven't you?
now why are you wasting state money?
will you please stop at a phone booth?
l want to call home.
why, when you were having fun, you didn't think about them.
Nikhil is HlV positive.
Sam and l'll go looking for him.
we suggest you go to Bombay and get yourself checked.
Nigel, I know
and I love you
what were my first thought when I found out
fear of loosing him.
the fear of losing the person I was .too
my little brother
when l read his diary.
I can feel the humiliation he went through
and I feel very angry
they can't keep you here like this.
we are all with you.
say something, Nigel.
l've been saying.
Nigel should go to Bombay for a check up.
l am not going any where until he is here.
we are there, aren't we?
today, we are even meeting a lawyer.
Sam is right.
you must go for a blood test.
did l ask for your opinion?
don't tell me what l've to do.
I. I think you need to talk
we'll wait outside.
l don't know how it all happened.
anu is right.
you need to get a blood test done.
what difference will it make?
lt is too late now.
you are angry with me, aren't you?
of course l am.
hiding such a big thing from me.
l did not wish to hide it from you.
but l myself didn't know what was happening to me.
l just suspected.
at least you could have told me.
l was scared, Nigel.
scared to face the truth.
and when l was finally faced with the truth.
l wanted to tell you, but.
they arrested me l need not go for a check up.
everyone who was around him had to anyway get tested.
we couldn't even refuse. The whole town was hysterical.
the think it is a homosexual disease.
all my tests were clear.
our relationship has nothing to do with the disease I was not HIV postive
now that my son is dead.
then why do you want to spoil his name?
he has so many girl friends.
we had even fixed his engagements to Leena.
he was perfectly normal boy
this's what happened to you when you go against god and nature.
he ruin Leena's life
can you imagine what she had to face?
she had to leave Goa.
we shifted to Bombay three days after his arrest.
people use to stare at me in Goa.
as if I was some. dirty thing lt was impossible for our family to live in Goa.
according to Goa Public Health Act any HlV positive person should be kept under isolation.
as if he was a criminal.
the search began for a lawyer wiling to fight for Nikhil.
strange!
even a murderer can find a lawyer with ease.
this case will create a lot of publicity wanted and unwanted
are you ready for that?
Yes, we are ready.
lf only we could find a lawyer willing to support us.
we need to tell the public how Nikhil is being treated.
we need public sympathy.
the press is treating him like a pervert.
yes l know that.
we need to make people realize that this can happen to anyone.
but before taking up this case..l want to meet Nikhil.
we tryed to approaching the government
but not a single response.
we have sent not one or two but several letters, but.
as if we don't matter l have been rotting here for two weeks.
I want to thank you for taking up my case
but l have a request.
you must fight this case....not just for my rights.
but for all those who are HlV positive.
who have the right to freedom and happiness?
it's a constitution right
I was terrified l was tense till the blood test results came in.
you know I'd kissed him
I was afraid
I grew up loving him
we were considered a couple
yes we did live close by and went to school together.
he was a little strange you know
I wasn't really a part of his friends out there
yes we ...friends so good
but it was different then.
he was not infected
people began to avoid us.
we've became . family
this is where we spent the last two and half years of Nikhil's life.
we setted up together
there.
we would sit there for hours and watch the sea.
how did we meet?
l used to see him often.
.At Geoffery's.
he was always surrounded by girls.
but l always felt that...he was with them, but..
but not interested
you know what I mean?
water light?
Hi, I am Nigel. l'm doing research at the Institute of Oceanography.
l've seen you here often.
Yeah, l've notice you too.
you are quite popular here.
I hope so
are you not from Goa?
yes and no.
my folks are in Dubai.
but we are originally Goans.
try me for a drink?
sure l found his double standards irritating.
perhaps he did not wish to hurt his parents.
and l guess he was right.
they wouldn't understand.
only Anu could understand.
but sometimes l felt that.
there were some things that were just between them.
and l even l was not included.
I used to feel a little jealous l would always tease Nigel.
that l knew Nikhil much better and for much longer than he did.
anu always fought with me.
Nikhil likes this, Nikhil hates that.
you know there was a space between both of them
that me and Sam could never intrude in
one look was enough for them to understand each other.
he never like me smoking
excuse me
sometimes there was tension between us.
especially over the Leena issue.
l was scared that he might succumb to social pressure.
anu don't
Why?
why shouldn't I?
tell me
was that kiss with the miss, an accident or did I imagine it at all?
OK, Let's go now
listen to me.
Nigel, you misunderstanding lt had become an issue.
l didn't know that the coach had refused..to take him on the tour.
some soup?
juice or something?
yummy
want to have some?
so how was your training today?
l didn't go.
when do you leave for the tour?
why are you in such a bad mood today?
did aunty invite Leena for dinner again?
why are you bringing up Leena?
she kisses beautifully l said she forced herself on me. - Forced herself?
next you'll say that she raped you.
my friend, it's important to take a stand in life.
or soon your dad will force you into the marriage.
Nikhil, double standards
don't mess around with my mind.
what is this ? cut yourself l am the one who has the right to be angry, not you.
l told her today.
what?
that l am not interested in her.
lt became a major issue at home.
that's why you are snapping at me.
I am sorry
tell me something?
honestly.
what?
have you ever been with someone else, besides me?
what are you talking about, Nikhil?
nothing, just asking.
when my blood test result was clear.
l was relieved.
when l saw him at the sanatorium that day...it was suffocating.
no one had inhabited that place for two years.
anu was shocked
we are all leaving for Bombay tomorrow.
but uncle?
son, how can we live here now?
do you want to leave Nikhil and go?
l said all of us.
l'm not going anywhere.
Anu. You can't stay here alone.
l'm here to take care of her.
even if Sam wasn't there, l wouldn't leave.
listen, Anu. We can't live here after the disgrace.
he is still alone.
Nikhil needs us more than ever but only care about the disgrace.
we'll leave for Bombay tomorrow.
and that's final.
you may disown your son and leave.
but l'll never desert him.
we are leaving.
please don't ever tell him we have left.
take care of your brother.
and yourself too.
Hello, May I speak with Susan?
this is Anamika from. Hi Susan
you didn't come to work? Are you unwell?
Oh, I see
perhaps you should shut shop for a while.
no.
l would accept defeat.
whether any one comes or not.
l'll not close this place.
are you okay?
how are your folks taking this?
they will understand eventually.
l don't want your family to face any trouble because of all this.
don't get me wrong, but lf you want.
I mean, you can.
l am only worried about you.
we will go through this together.
you see people's reactions are dictated by .
people who were close to them turned their backs.
he was very depressed today.
even the doctors treat like an untouchable.
lt's been a whole month.
there has been no progress.
what do you think?
l did warn you.
lt was going to be tough.
lndian Health Organization is willing to support us.
we need to gather public sympathy.
to let them know that he is a champion, not a criminal.
he is the victim of a tragedy.
use the emotional angle.
lf your son were to meet with an accident.
and god forbid, he gets infected through blood transfusion
or a new born baby gets the virus through the mother.
would you isolate that baby too?
the issue is not how someone got the virus.
the issue is, can any one be locked up like this?
did you have your check up today?
anu won't be coming today.
she and Anjali have to meet some officials.
this nightmare will be over soon.
l've been hearing this for the last two months.
anjali is sure that the ministry.
mom and dad didn't come and meet me even once.
how are they?
they wanted to come and see you, but .
but they haven't come.
got this for you
love and not fear is the only solutionto this problem
today there is one victim, tomorrow there will be a lakh.
will you be able to isolate all of them?
according to artical 14, 19, 21, 226
indian Consititution garantees all indians the foundamental right to live freely
this force isolation, is violation of this right
he is just HlV positive.
lt could take years for it to become full blown AlDS.
how can you keep confinement indefinitely
look at this picture.
this is our state swimming champion.
we always were proud of him
what has he done that you have all deserted him?
anu it's not safe for you to stay alone any more.
Yes, Anu. You can stay with me.
even l feel lonely these days.
okay.
anyway there is nothing left for me here.
she was very brave and didn't get scared.
our efforts continued.
his school principal was very supportive.
he was respected by society.
slowly people started to accept his point of view.
and after three months.
Nikhil was finally freed.
we did it, Nikhil
congratulations
all the best
mom and dad had to go Bombay. Aunty is not well.
they will be back soon.
when did they leave?
the day after you were arrested.
what's up? What are you thinking?
I was .something
what?
you will not request them to come here.
l won't.
l have one more request. - What else?
I want to see you married
don't say such things.
you've come home today.
'when the moon smiles. "
'when the wind whispers. "
'my presence. "
'.will be with you. "
'when darkness descends. "

'Waves of memories flood me. "
'we will go where? "
'the earth meets the sky. "
let me take you.
l want to go back to work.
Nikhil, there is a problem.
they have had someone else for your position.
l was on leave.
Nikhil, you are not well.
l'm just HlV positive. l don't have AlDS, Anu.
l know but.
no buts. l am sick and tired of being restricted.
l need court permission to even step out.
you call this freedom?
lt is easy for you to say.
you are all free
I am not
I understand that
I want to fight for this l want to lead a normal life.
I want to be happy
we will fight, Nikhil.
we've decided to downsize.
I mean, we won't require your sevices any longer
sir, you know that you don't have the right to do this.
look, you will receive six months salary as compensation.
as well as your pension and other benefits.
sir, l have a contract that clearly says.
you forget that you aren't in the team anymore.
you were given this job because you were the state champion.
sir, you can't do this.
l have got a court order.
l can file a case against you.
Nikhil, be reasonable.
no one is comfortable working with you.
they have families.
they're afraid.
l should be the one scared of you people.
at this moment, you and your employees could...give me an infection that could be fatal for me.
and you are afraid of me.
we can fight back Nikhil.
we will win.
no.
Why?
what happened?
what is the point?
ln a place where everyone stares at me.
where everyone is afraid of me.
what is the point of working there?
they don't want me there
then what?
I will resign
resign?
you wanted to work.
why give up so easily?
l'm not giving up, Anjali.
this is an opportunity to fulfil a dream.
music
Gaston Roberge will speak to the student's parents...so that l can teach music in the school.
there are couple of other things.
good morning.
what happened?
nothing. Just that from tomorrow you.
so, what do you suggest? That l don't get married?
stay unmarried all my life?
l'm not going far.
just 10 minutes drive
anu, I really miss you
specially your, snoring l'll take your leave.
l have to take Nikhil and Anamika to the jeweller.
what time is the ceremony?
five in the evening.
okay.
lsn't strange?
today l saw mum and dad after a whole year.
but dad didn't look at me even once.
he didn't ask me to come home.
good.
you can continue to stay with me.
Nikhil, can l tell you something?
what? - l'm really scared of your dad.
Yes. l know.
doesn't the house feel empty?
Yes.
but it's okay.
what do you mean?
between you and your sister. I was feeling a little left
jealous
tell me something.
you never asked me...how l got the virus.
what difference will it make?
l shall not leave you.
how did Nikhil get the virus?
there could be several explanations.
but l don't want to discuss that.
because it's not important how he got it.
what is important is to understand that...how he was treated after he contracted this virus.
l can never forgive myself.
l'm his mother.
l could have done something.
I could have taken a stand l don't know why god is punishing me.
for the first time l felt distance from him.
Nikhil, all you need now is a tattoo and earrings.
l'm not a fashion victim like you.
need a trim here also.
please come in.
l'll bring some tea.
look at me.
don't be angry with me, son.
everything happened so suddenly.
without thinking about it l said some awful things.
whose side should l have taken?
how is dad?
you know how much he loves you.
come back home, Nikhil.
l'm fine here.
with Nigel.
lt's eleven thirty.
why don't you have dinner?
l'm not angry.
you should eat something.
your pills are kept on the table.
l'll eat when l am hungry.
you can go to sleep.
ls there anything else you need?
no.
good night.
Anita stopped talking to me.
as if l was the villain.
l'm a father too.
l too have lost a son.
l remember that he used to have nightmares as a child.
l used to sit by him all night.
I wanted to make him strong
never thought that in the end....that he would turn out stronger than me.
we set up a small group.
now l work here full time.
we collect data and information from all over the world...related to AlDS and HlV.
Nikhil started working again.
Gaston Roberge had convinced the parents that.
. there kids had nothing to fear from Nikhil.
how are you now?
I'm fine
he is so tiny.
would you like to hold him?
he is too small.
l feel scared.
it's oK
why don't you try holding him?
can I hold him? - Yeah, sure
are you happy that your brother has come to meet you?
Where's Sam?
he had to go for a meeting at the school.
hold him.
Nikhil was the happiest person when Ashish was born.
Nikhil would play with him for hours.
and Ashish too was the happiest with his uncle.
he was very artistic.
but of course, we never accepted it.
he had to be a sportsman, after all.
he started painting again, later on.
sometimes l feel he never really understood...the most beautiful side of our son.
superb, fantastic
what is it?
modern art, you wouldn't understand.
do you remember what the occasion is today?
what's it?
give me your hand.
a smile is not enough.
where is my gift?
you are still so greedy.
you are still so miserly.
okay, this time l let you go.
but next time you'll.
where is my Rakhi?
but you are my boy friend.
why didn't you bring Ashish along today?
today the naughty has gone with Sam to visit his grand parents.
lf we were at home today...mom would have made special food and sweets.
mom had come yesterday.
she was saying.
that she misses Ashish a lot.
go and visit our house some times.
l'll only go when you come with me.
by Mid 1992
Nikhil's condition had begun to deteriorate.
how are you?
great
Nikhil l mean.
l know what you mean.
you always understand things.
lt's me who is always unreasonable.
l'm coming after meeting the doctor.
tomorrow we shall take you for blood transfusion.
you'll feel much better, OK?
don't treat me like a child, Nigel.
l know what's going to happen.
my health is so good that...for 3 days l haven't been able to go for my music class.
you can easily walk around.
how would you understand?
you know l don't mean to.
Nikhil, to see you in this condition.
lt's not easy for me either.
but l'm trying.
l know that.
you reaaly care
that's why l am so scared to leave you guys.
you are not going any where.
that means l'll have to bear with you all my life.
'the distant echo. "
'of your voice. "
'small little things. "
'playful and mischievous. "
'the magic of those moments. "
'even now my heart cherishes those moments. "
'Waves of memories flood me. "

'let me take you. "
do you want to have some cake? lt's butterscotch.
your favorite.
mom, sit down. Mom.
this is the first time my grandson has come home, how can l?
and what about your son?
there was a time when this house echoed...with the sound of your voices.
and now.
lt's filled with silence and emptiness.
today l went to see him.
he was looking...very thin and weak.
mom.
what's the point of thinking about all this?
mom, Nikhil has been waiting for long time.
.for you both to bring him back home.
bring your little boy, home.
look he's smiling.
doesn't he look like Nikhil?
don't you ever miss him?
which year was it?
l think it was 84 or 85.
find out from Anu.
for the last two years...l've been waiting for you.
I let you know
you've always made me very proud, son
just as in my childhood days...assure me once again.
that this is just a bad dream...and it will pass by.
come, let us go home.
mom is waiting for you.
we will all celebrate new year together.
l was happy that Nikhil was going back to his house.
but, l also knew that...he would never be able to come back here.
'when the moon smiles. "
'when the wind whispers. "
'my presence. "
'.will be with you. "
'when darkness descends. "
'l will bring daylight to you. "
'Waves of memories flood me. "
'we will go where? "
'the earth meets the sky. "
'when life feels lonely. "
'when your eyes fill with tears. "
'and your heart feels heavy. "
'when you loose hope and feel weary. "
'you will find me next to you. "
'let me take you. "
why don't you rest for some time?
l'll keep watch.
ls he asleep?
no, aunty is with him.
how is he tonight?
go and see him, he was asking for you.
l can't go inside.
you to be strong, Anu
I can't be strong any more
don't ask me to be more strong.
tell him l went away.
l can't say him like this.
I don't want to cry in front of him
don't cry so much, princess.
l don't like it.
this is not fair
but l always have my way in this house.
please Nikhil, don't.
Sam, take care of my princess
I love you, Anu
take care of yourself.
don't ever feel that you are alone.
what is the time?
five o'clock ln half an hour.
.another day will begin.
every night we would wait for that moment.
after the night ended, before the day begun.
he did not want to miss that moment, that sight.
sometimes l feel lonely.
but then I think of him smile
I look forward to another sunrise
Gaston Roberge had organised the prayer meeting on Nikhil's first death anniversary.
this is an important event in Goa.
how are you son?
l am fine.
my parents want me to return to Dubai.
and are you leaving?
l don't know.
l don't feel like being here anymore.
son, you gave Nikhil so much love.
and we kept you at a distance.
we never accepted you.
now you are leaving too.
son, today when l saw you after a year...at the memorial service.
Nikhil would be very unhappy.
you have always been his hero.
but he has already gone.
whether l am weak or strong, cry or don't cry.
he is gone.
forever.
Nigel went to Dubai for a month.
both of us work for people positive.
which aims to help people like Nikhil.
now dad calls Nigel his son.
really
I just wish it happen a little earlier
so this was the story of my brother Nikhil
this camera is so old.
it's my father's - How's your mom? - Fine.
can you wait, Jong-hyun?
how long?
not too long. The machine is busted.
I will wait. There's no hurry.
she was mild and naive.
he liked taking pictures.
they fell in love, got married and had a baby.
but the birth of the babay was not blessing.
she stopping going to church.
he stopped taking pictures.
he threw out the baby without telling her
but she returned with her baby.
afterward
he became weaker due to illness and died.
soon after, she relized that she was pregnant.
she swore not to be naive any more.
but to be strong and raise the baby well.
in the following year I was born.
my Brother
this is right. Don't miss out on payments.
mom was a moneylender.
she took us around with her when collecting interests.
I hated that.
Hello? Du-sik's mom?
Du-sik was retarded.
they complained he and my brother gave the neighborhood a bad name.
I couldn't blame them.
I'm a leech? Pay on time then!
by next week! Don't mess with me.
bitch!
you stinking... - Shut your hole!
let's go!
Du-sik! Du-sik! Come here! - Cover your ears.
don't listen to her crap.
you're getting us wet! - You're getting us wet!
nicknamed 'Money Ghost'
she made sure they paid no matter what it took.
that hard-earned money...
every penny was spent on my brother's surgeries.
he's here, Doctor. Wait for a second.
not scared, are you?
afterward
I'll buy you whatever you want.
anything you want!
be brave, okay?
it's okay. - Operation is ready.
don't worry a thing.
mom.
can I ask you something? - What?
can you buy me new shoes if I have the surgery instead?
what greeted Sung-hyun into the world was a cold syringe needle not mom's nipples.
it seemed so easy for others but it took days for him to nibble on her nipples.
he was hare-lipped.
medically called a cleft palate it's one of those congenital malformations.
you' re so silly.
it'll go away in a few days.
mother. - What?
c-can you m-make this go away too?
no, I can't.
you know why?
it's a God-given token for an angel.
it'll stay there forever.
come here, baby.
my precious!
you're a good boy, Sung-hyun.
you listen to mom well.
you're good in class.
I always felt left out.
he had two more surgeries afterwards.
as she had wished we got into the same school.
he was a year older but we were in the same class.
die, son of a bitch!
listen, assholes.
this is freaking tiring.
I'll take you on as a group next time.
you heard him.
he'll take you all on... Assholes!
wait up, Jong-hyun.
quiet, quiet!
we're from the Lit. Club.
we guarantee opportunities to hook up with chicks.

Why?

he is so cute! Isn't he? - Yeah I saw him too!
lsn't he a bully? - He rules DongSung High.
he's so cute and bully as well?
it will be so lucky if I get to go out with him.
give it a try.
Asako and I met three times.
we shouldn't have met the third time.
I'm going to Chuncheon this weekend.
it's breathtaking out there.
I might not be able to see her ever again.
missing her all my life...
Ca.Can.Can't see - Damn.
I've had it!
you either see her or not.
who the hell is Asako? Your squeeze?
it was a kick-ass dream.
I have to dream it again!
why don't you get me one too?
an amulet that will get me into college without studying.
this is good.
he's a well-known diviner.
he went to Seoul Nat'l University.
what a wasted degree!
it cost me an arm and a leg. Try it on.
here.
gosh, you look great with anything on.
so handsome!
t-this is an expensive brand. - It is!
I'm not eating!
I wish you had his character.
Hey.
bring that Burberry jacket.
Jong-hyun, this isn't the real thing.
I know!
you know what?
genuine ones look fake on you but fakes look genuine on me.
you got that?
where are you going?
you don't need to know.
Hi.

Jong-hyun. - Sir.

you helped me... to see the light in the darkness.
I hereby pledge my loyalty to you.
that's right.
Jong-hyun! Come here.

Harelip!
Where's your bodyguard?

no idea.
can I ask you something?
aren't you upset you were born as a harelip?
were you born because you wanted to?
you got me there.
I just... I just don't think about it.
it's not life-threatening.
I read in a book that everything happens for a reason.
I'm sure there's a reason... why I was born like this.
who wrote that book?
I did.
shit, I'm getting dizzy again.
wow, it's awesome.
you can never see this from down below.
you okay?
there it goes. - What?
Du-sik is retarded! Du-sik is retarded!
C'mon... C'mon!
C'mon! C'mon!
let's go.
Hey, KiM Jong-hyun!
would you mind?
who's he? - Huh?
my younger brother.
what are you doing here?
I heard you fought over me. Is that true?
no way!
a poem recital is coming up. I want you to come.
let's see what she wrote.
waiting doesn't have to lead to meeting.
God, she's so talented!
let the heart ache.
let the wind blow your smile away.
days of wandering for my other half somewhere.
days of wandering. I like this part.
she must've wandered a lot.
if i were meant for someone upon birth, I'd like to meet him now.
what does she want to do with me?
this is good. She sure can write.
what? Envious? Don't be, It's a burden.
you focus on studying. That's what you do best.
should I try?
dear Mi-ryung
I'm your bodyguard. A bodyguard of love.
call me if you need my help.
I'm at your service 247...
so freaking corny!
forget it!
Blossoming...
son of a...
next is 'Four-Leaf Clover' by KiM Jong-hyun.
four-leaf Clover' by KiM Jong-hyun.
don't be so sad
because you have only three leaves.
if you had four leaves they would...
they would've picked you long ago
don't be sad because nobody...
pays attention to you.
my eyes are set on you.
let me be your missing leaf.
even if nobody sees... it your way...
you're the most beautiful leaf for my eyes.
your existence...
...is so special to my heart
knowing you... I couldn't be luckier.
firecrackers!
$5 for two! $1 0 for five!
firecrackers!
$5 for two! $1 0 for five!
here...
a poem shouldn't be difficult.
it should be easy to understand.
one that the most ignorant can grasp.
one that makes... tears roll down on your face...
that's a great poem.
got that?
here, It's for you.
it looks exactly like me.
did you draw this? - Huh?
Yeah, I did
lean over.
wow, It's so nice here.
let's come back.
Sung-Hyun, Go ahead.
I'll stay a little longer. Okay?
say... Mi-ryung!
what?
Ki...ss...
where did Mom go?
didn't I ask you a question?
go cook me noodles
what's going on?
didn't you hear me? - You do it.
what?
What'd you say? - Cook them yourself!
are you putting me down? - You always put me down!
want your ass kicked?
cook me noodles. - You do it!
cook it - You do it - Cook it - You do it. Asshole!
what?
are you high on something?
go cook me noodles.
you do it.
a piece of advice.
know your place, will you?
shit!
what... do you wanna be?
nothing
what about you?
don't laugh, okay?
an actress. - That's a long shot.
I know this agent in Seoul.
he's been asking me to come up.
don't get me wrong. He's just a friend.
Mi-ryung.
I don't think we're good together.
I came to tell you that.
Jong-hyun?
let's break up before I fall head over heels.
what do you mean?
I know.
it might not make sense to you. But it does to me.
Jong-Hyun...
we're strangers from now on.
Mi-ryung.
I'm sure you'll make it as an actress.
brother!
what are you doing? Go get her!
who the hell are you?
do you know who I am?
yes
what's your name?
KLM Jong-Hyun.
KLM Jong-Hyun...
I don't like by baby sister giviing me headaches.
I'd like to live in peace.
know what I mean?
I don't think so.
damn.
see you again, Jong-hyun.
excuse me.
is Jong-hyun home?
yes
I need to talk to him. Can you get him for me?
what's it about?
just get him please.
anything wrong?
go get him, will you?
tell him I'm not going anywhere until I see him.
what do you want?
is that all you have to say?
I think so.
tell me... Do you hate me?
Yes.
but why? Give me a reason.
I don't need a reason to hate you.
for the last time...
I wanted to see you.
I'm going to Seoul.
good-bye.
Jong-hyun!
KLM Jong-hyun!
let's go.
that was the last time I saw her.
Sung-hyun studied hard and got into med school at Seoul National University.
as Mom had wished.
after he moved to Seoul... things have changed.
I'd never realized his space until he left us.
as you can see, it's new with a good location.
great for business.
look at the brochure.
this, the interior will be way better...
once completed. A masterpiece.
Hey, it's going to the 3rd floor.
take a look around.
you know what they call you at the cram school?
burberry Man!
don't you have other jackets?
shut up, asshole. What'd you want?
neither of us is the academic type.
let's make money - How?
there's a way.
I already talked to my mom.
her savings account matures at the month-end.
let's start a street bar.
that's no money-maker.
you live once. Try to live with style!
then again...
your soon-to-be toctor brother will make money for you.
what's the occation?
got a problem I'm being nice?
mom - What?
you goto some money put aside? - I paid the down payment today.
you're walking on clouds.
you're not a business type.
didn't I tell you not to do it?
I can't be a moneylender... once your brother becomes a doctor.
why don't I start a street bar?
when I have the experience...
we'll open a restaurant like this.
sut up and keep studying.
you need a colledge degree for a doctor brother.
let me ask you something. - Sure.
Where's everybody?
don't you know? The company's gone down.
Mrs. SlM!
mom!
what's the matter?
Jong-Hyun...
I think I'm going insane.
what should I do?
Why? Anything wrong?
ever since I started doing the list, it'd just been me and Randy, but now my new wife Billie made three.
Mmm, watch this.
there's this part coming up that's really funny.
and I was starting to understand the expression "Three's a crowd."
he's gonna think that it's his wife licking his leg, but it's really gonna be the dog. Watch, watch.
Yep, there it is, just like you said.
thanks for telling me, so I could be ready for it.
and the way we watched TV wasn't the only change.
I used to drive my own car, but Billie thought I drove like a girl, so she insisted on doing it herself.
you better take five steps backwards right now, bitch.
unfortunately, she had a problem with road rage.
just forget it, it's gone. Go!
and I used to have my own money, but I spent it throwing an arsonist a prison prom.
and while it was an enchanted evening, it left me broke, and I was now living off Billie.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. How many tissues you got there?
two.
how many times you gonna blow your nose?
one.
you might want to check your math, Mr. Rockefeller.
and because Billie's money also paid for the room, she got to decide the sleeping arrangements.
of course he can stay with us, Earl. He's family.
he's just gonna have to be an outside brother.
my favorite part of the day was when Billie took a shower, until she started singing.
I don't get it, Randy. I just don't get it.
why would Karma want me to be with a woman who's driving me crazy?
you should just cut her head off like that King of England dude, or the guy who used to live downstairs.
it's not that easy.
Billie's supposed to be my reward.
karma brought her into my life to show me that I was doing things right.
you don't return a gift like that.
you do if she makes you sleep outside.
I got sprayed by a cat last night.
which is a lie-- it wasn't a cat.
it was a grown man.
I was too embarrassed to say that.
I know Billie's a handful, but I'm sure Karma has its reasons.
not to mention, before Billie hit me with her car, her life was a mess.
I can't let her go back to that.
I'm gonna go sleep on the balcony.
I kind of made friends with that Filipino grandmother from room 206.
they won't let her sleep inside either.
I couldn't help but think about how different my reality was, compared to my fantasy.
when I was in a coma, my relationship with Billie was perfect.
she made me cakes, she brought me lemonade, and when she kissed me, even her leg got excited.
I wondered why Karma brought me out of my coma only to make me more miserable.
and I wondered, was it just gonna get worse for the rest of my life?
Oh, there's nothing like a crap and a shower to make you feel better.
I think I'm just gonna go for a walk.
I married Billie 'cause I trusted Karma.
karma had never let me down before, but every day that went by made me lose a little more faith.
I did 25 minutes at level six.
if you can't beat me, you're a wuss.
come on, faster.
if we want to grow old together, we need to be healthy.
Yep, this marriage was definitely a mystery.
I need some advice, so I went to see the smartest person I knew.
there was a reason Joy and Darnell's trailer was on its side
a while back, me and some friends broke in to have a party.
normally, when you have beer and strippers in a trailer, you tip the strippers.
we went another way and tipped the trailer.
Hello?
crab Man?
Hey, Earl.
I really am sorry about this whole trailer thing.
Ah, don't sweat it, Earl. I kind of like it.
besides, with the grass growing out of the floor, Mr. Turtle has his own little park.
huh. Never seen him wag his little tail before.
Yeah, I'm happy for him.
listen, I need to ask you a marriage question.
how do you handle being married to someone who's difficult?
try this.
I just write down everything Joy does that bothers me.
most psychologists will tell you to express your thoughts and feelings without fear of confrontation.
these are individuals I call "people who have not met Joy.
Earl, you gotta flip this trailer right-side-up.
I got so many bruises from climbing through this door,
I look like a woman in a Lifetime movie.
I'm gonna do it, Joy. I just need to figure out how to get some money from Billie to rent a crane.
one way would be to grow some nads.
speaking of being nadless...
Darnell, are you showing Earl your poetry books?
uh, yeah, we were having a poetry slam.
let me read one.
today, she hit a new low.
got mad cooking dinner, and threw the chicken on the lawn.
once again, I see why everyone in our trailer park despises her and wishes we would move.
that's a terrible poem, Darnell. It don't even rhyme.
Hey, remember that time I drove chicken on the lawn?
you should write a poem about that, but make it rhyme.
did you pee a little?
Yep. - Me, too.
while I was getting advice about my wife, Randy was being tortured by her.
can I have a Klondike Bar, please?
that depends...
what would you do for a Klondike Bar?
Nah, seen it.
unfortunately for Randy, the motel was next to a costume shop.
would you like to buy some delicious cookies?
uh, two slim mint and three peanut butter sandwich.
now? - Almost.
and, unfortunately for Randy, the motel was also next to a street.
you loser!
bet you can't hit me with your trash
enjoy.
I rescued Randy and continued my quest for relationship advice by going to the happiest couple I knew.
the most important thing in a relationship is to take your time with foreplay.
all work and no foreplay makes Jack a dull boy.
I got that from a Will & Grace rerun.
you start by lightly trailing your fingers down your lover's chest.
let him know that you want him.
let the love flow. Call him "lover."
call your lover "lover" as often as possible.
whisper it.
lover.
lover.
lover.
lover.
they have just as much right to kiss in public as anyone else.
which one's the girl?
I don't know how this stuff works, Randy, I...
Oh, looks like it's Kenny.
my gay pals sure seemed happy, so I decided to take their advice.
I love foreplaying with you, lover.
you're such a good lover.
Hey, not on the menu.
I just figured from the way you were talking, you might be into a little bit of...
Nope, you are mistaken.
that was just the poke I need to continue the search for a way to make my marriage work.
so I decided to talk to the person who had made a marriage work the longest.
Earl, I'm just...I am just so excited that you'd come to me for marriage advice.
okay, first off, do you call each other "lover"?
Yeah, once. Not my cup of tea.
mmm-hmm, and you know about the foreplay and finding the G-spot?
is Dad here? 'Cause I may be better off talking to him.
Oh, Dad's working late at the shop again.
and when you figure that this is the last night we have to decide on the fabric for the new drapes...
Oh, actually, maybe you could give ME some advice.
I don't really know anything about fabrics.
no, just tell me which one you like.
uh, the middle one.
that one? Why would you pick that one?
I don't know, it looks nice.
nicer than the first one?
okay, I like the first one.
Oh, see... see, now you're just saying that.
this is gonna be the last time that we redecorate this house, Earl.
these are going to be the drapes that I die looking at.
you don't care enough about me to give me your honest opinion?!
no...
dad was lucky he wasn't home for this, but then I started to realize Dad was lucky like this a lot.
like how he missed all of Mom's Wednesday night dinner adventures.
well, we're not waiting for your father any longer.
tonight's voyage...
asia.
and not the American version either, real Asian food-- crickets.
pure protein.
our annual family portrait.
there's an emergency down at the framing shop.
apparently, all the 5x7 frames came in 7x5.
your father's going to be there all night.
we're going to have to take the white picture without him.
can my gerbil be in the picture?
is he white?
or every year when my mom wanted us to go caroling.
I'm sorry, boys. Your father has to work late again.
five nights in a row.
well, we're just going to have to do it without him.
or we could just blow it off and watch TV.
Oh, silly.
come on, big smiles, and get your umbrella.
it's pouring rain out there.
I knew then that Dad didn't just happen to miss certain things with my mom, he avoided them on purpose.
he threw himself into his job to make his marriage work.
it hit me that I need to do the same, only my job wasn't framing, it was the list.
I guess I'd find out if it worked.
Earl! You missed the Ethiopian adventure last night.
I got pickled ox tail.
gotta go. Something on the list.
dad was a genius.
I'd finally found a way to get along with my wife: by avoiding her.
so like a lot of husbands,
I decided to spend all my time at work, which for me meant finding something to do on my list.
here's a good one, Earl.
#275-- Never bought Randy a Ferrari.
or #276
never told chicks Randy was a fighter pilot.
okay, #277...
Randy, how many of these did you add when I was in a coma?
zero.
fifty.
that's it, Earl.
I'm done waiting for you to flip my house back.
I was walking past our ceiling fan, which is now on our wall, and it lopped off one of my ponytails.
you owe me 25 bucks.
I told you, I need money for a crane, and Billie's just getting stingier.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
what, did you buy stock in the toothpaste company?
I'll save some of it for the morning.
it didn't sound that wet.
what, you just gonna let some bitchy woman make your decisions for you?
if you had any self-respect, you'd do what the hell I say.
I didn't get it.
karma's mystery was getting deeper.
I was doing the list to get away from my nightmare of a wife, only to have Karma stick me with my nightmare of an ex-wife.
then I'm gonna take my foot out, and put it back in again, deeper!
joy, I want to help you, I just don't know how.
if we were ants, we wouldn't need a crane, Earl.
we could lift a million times our weight.
ants are so ripped. They must get laid all the time.
Randy had a good point,
not just about ants boning a lot.
ants also worked as a team.
come on, everybody, pull!
when I was doing bad things, no one would help me with anything.
but now that I was doing good things,
I had lots of friends willing to pitch in.
come on, pull, you lazy bastards!
you are so Spartacus.
no, no, you are so Spartacus.
you are. - Oh, no, you are.
come on, people! Let's put some muscle into it.
I am so sorry.
it's coming! It's coming!
keep pulling.
pull! It's coming.
keep pulling.
thank you so much, everybody.
I got pony kegs in the side yard. Enjoy.
help! My foot is stuck.
it was great to see everyone pulling together like that...
and pull together like that.
Plus, I was successfully staying away from Billie.
it was my first real good day since I got married.
Hey, Earl, your wife's on the phone.
I told her you were drinking a beer and she got really mad.
Hey, honey.
no, he's, he's crazy, it's just a soda.
God, I miss you. What's up?
I ordered a bunch of stuff to go from Chubby's Pulled Pork, and I need you to pick it up.
feel free to get something for yourself.
just stay on the left side of the menu.
Oh, man, I really love that dinner salad, but work's crazy. Gotta go.
don't wait up. Love you!
I need to pick another list item, but before I could, Karma picked one for me.
Oh, my God, Earl! I found a leg!
Oh, God, not another body.
this is not a graveyard, people!
pony up for your grandparents to have a decent funeral!
it's nobody's grandparent.
it's not even a real leg.
I knew it was fake, because I had ditched it under the trailer after committing #86:
stole a car from a one-legged girl.
stand back!
I wish I could say it was only her car I stole.
you said you loved me!
it doesn't make sense.
I'm doing the list to keep away from one nightmare woman,
karma sends me to deal with Joy, another nightmare woman.
now, it's sending me Didi, the biggest nightmare I've ever met.
what the hell's going on?
sometimes I wish Karma could talk.
that'd take a lot of guesswork out of what we do.
but if I only had one wish in the world,
I'd be an ant who was ripped and got laid a lot.
hopefully, I'll get two wishes.
I was wishing for something different: that I wouldn't be killed by Didi.
I figured we'd go by where she worked, so she'd have less chance of having her shotgun.
excuse me, I found a leg in my doughnut.
Randy. - Come on.
maybe we'll get a free doughnut.
I know we came from a keg party, but try to act sober, okay?
ow, that's hot.
freshest doughnuts in town, you son of a bitch.
after some discussion, I learned Didi already had her car back and didn't just want her leg, she wanted me to feel her pain.
and if I was gonna figure out what Karma was trying to tell me,
I guess I had to do what she said.
I want you to hop a mile in my shoe.
I never thought about how hard I made Didi's life by stealing her fake leg.
but she made me understand how even the simple things in life became complicated, like bringing home groceries.
getting them to the door wasn't too bad, but freeing up a hand to open it put too much weight on one side.
and, like how the lights are set to give people enough time to walk across the street, not hop.
get out of the street!
she made me learn how frustrating it was to pay full price for a pair of shoes when you knew you were only gonna wear one.
Didi made me realize that even trying to relax was difficult.
go back.
Didi must have realized I was getting the message, 'cause she let me share the half of her foot bath that she never used.
I am so sorry.
I forgive you.
you can cross me off your list.
my foot hurt so bad, I had to use the other one to get home.
I still didn't understand how suffering for Didi was Karma's answer to me suffering with my wife.
then came the weirdest thing yet.
look, Earl, I'm sorry I've been a little stingy with you.
it's our money.
here's an ATM card, so you don't have to ask me for it anymore.
there's a special card you have to put in.
and... I got you your own box of tissues.
you should be able to decide how many you need.
well, thanks.
I'll be right back.
I don't get it.
she was terrible and now she's nice. What's Karma trying to tell me?
it's so obvious, Earl.
if you pick up a trailer for one lady you pissed off and you hop around for another lady you pissed off, then your annoying wife will give you a box of tissues.
I think the ATM card is just random.
you bring up a good point, Randy.
I've pissed off a lot of ladies.
but when I made it up to two of them, the lady pissing me off got nicer.
I think you're just restating my tissue example.
maybe that's what Karma's been saying.
maybe if I make up to the women I've hurt, my marriage will start to work.
I just wish there was a way I could double-check.
Hi, Earl. - Catalina! Perfect. Come here.
when I saw you at Club Chubby on Christmas, I was a pig, right?
and, and I slapped your butt cheek.
Yeah, hard enough to leave a mark.
when Santa came, I couldn't even sit on his lap, and he's a big tipper.
well, then, be mean back. Make me suffer.
uh, you can slap my ass or...
thank you. That was perfect.
I thought so.
check it out.
they just added lemonade and Chubby Cakes to the vending machine.
I know you like them.
and there it was, just like in my coma fantasy.
I had a wife who brought me cakes and lemonade.
and, Randy, something for you, too.
what do I have to do?
smile.
then she did something that really blew my mind.
did you hear that, Randy?
she went to the bathroom and shut the door.
it's all clear now.
I've had bad marriages because I've deserved bad marriages.
I've been horrible to women.
but if I keep making it up to them, things will keep getting better with Billie and me.
Randy, I need to make up for the worst thing I've ever done to women.
#204-- Seduced seven virgins.
but, with the ATM card, I mean, don't abuse it or anything.
it's ours, but it's mainly mine.
and, Randy, you're still sleeping on the balcony.
you need to get to those virgins fast.
I'd been horrible to women in the past, with my new wife, Billie, was to make up for that.
I can't wait for you to fix this thing with Billie so I can stop sleeping on the balcony,
although, lately when I wake up facing the railing,
I feel like I'm in a giant crib...
which is nice.
if I was gonna get Randy off the balcony,
I need to make up for the worst thing I'd ever done to women:
#204, Seduced seven virgins.
way back when, a group of Amish settled near Camden.
everything was fine, until they started adopting modern technology.
behold... the wheel!
that is the devil's work!
it has no beginning and no end.
we shall have none of it.
and so, unwilling to change their deep-seated beliefs, half the group left and called themselves the Camdenites.
as the world grew up around them, the Camdenites decided that when each young girl turned 21, they would go out to experience regular society for 21 days.
those tempted by the evils of the outside world can choose to stay there, but those pure of heart shall return to the glories of a world with no wheels, no medicine and no advancements in knowledge of any kind whatsoever!
can thou give me a "hallelujah"?
Hallelujah!
I used to call it the Running of the Virgins.
every year, me and Randy were outside waiting for a bunch of innocent women who had never heard a pick-up line.
greetings, ladies.
is it hot out here, or is it just you?
me and my brother have just been sent out from the Nathanite religious settlement for 21 days.
Really? We are just now also on a journey into the world.
that's crazy!
how lucky are you to so quickly run into people you can completely trust?
come, let us explore the world together.
our goal was...
I think our goal was pretty obvious.
this barley soda's making me feel warm under the bonnet.
you know, that dancing thing looks interesting.
I'm afraid to try it alone.
Oh, do not be afraid, Earleth, I shall do it with you.
okay, but we gotta stay real close so the devil doesn't get between us.
if there's anything you're afraid of, I'd be willing to try it with you...
unless it's cauliflower.
I had a good thing going.
and I did it year after year.
some years, the crops were plentiful.
other years, there was a drought.
but a good farmer always finds something to plow.
Yes, yes! Call me a Jezebel!
so I went back to Camdenite Village and talked to their leader, Ruth, to see how I could make up to all those former virgins.
none of them are here.
they never came back.
they were alive when we left them, if that's what you're hinting at.
no, they all had such a great time in the outside world, they decided to stay.
wow, if they're happy now,
I guess it's not the worst thing I ever did to women.
maybe not to them, but it was to the rest of us.
you started a trend, and you know how kids are, always swept up in the latest craze, like zippers or those wooden figures on a stick that dance on your knee.
none of our daughters come back anymore.
and without women, the Camdenites will soon be gone.
maybe Karma wants me to make something up to you.
I know! We could buy you a pitchfork, so you could shovel horse food like a normal person.
we don't use pitchforks. They are the tool of the devil.
although I tried one once, and it was about a thousand times easier.
there-there's gotta be something I can do.
my niece Greta just turned 21, and in a few days, will go out into the world.
if you want to help, make sure she comes back.
Oh, and if she could bring back the recipe for flour...
we lost ours years ago.
ruth was hoping that if Greta returned after being in the outside world, other Camdenite girls would follow her example, and their community would be saved.
to convince Greta that she wouldn't want to live in the outside world,
I showed her the scariest thing I could think of: television.
this is all so violent and horrible.
this is a show called C. S.I. Miami.
that means "Crime Stuff in Miami.
that Creamsicle-looking guy, his name's Horatio.
Hello, cute hubby.
I've got a special surprise for you.
Randy, will you and your friend give us a second?
sure. I'll show you my bedroom. It's really big.
it's the entire outside.
guess what I got.
flavored body gels.
chocolate, strawberry and vanilla.
my plan seemed to be working.
I was taking care of my lady, Karma, so my lady was taking care of me.
all right.
I'm gonna go with the strawberry.
smeared chocolate puts me in the wrong frame of mind.
then, my mission to make Greta dislike our world hit a bump.
Oh, that is most wondrous.
on the farm, the only fun thing we have to chew on is ox cartilage, but the flavor is gone after two seconds.
no sooner did Greta start enjoying stuff from the modern world then Karma made Billie change her tune.
damn it, Earl!
didn't I talk to you about letting people sit on the made-up bed?
Yeah, well, aren't we about to mess it up?
you didn't know that when you let people sit on it.
I get it.
I know what's going on.
karma's making you mad at me 'cause the girl out there is on my list and I need to be dealing with her.
what the hell are you talking about?
great, she's chewing gum. That's a gateway candy!
Randy, make her spit it out.
honey, I really need to get out there.
no, we're in the middle of something.
look, I'm not trying to ignore you.
it's just that, if I don't make up to all the women I've hurt, you're gonna stay like this, and Karma's never gonna make you my reward.
wait, so that's what I am to you? Some kind of carnival prize?
no, not right now, but...
Oh, come on, Randy, you're killing me!
look, forget about the prize thing. Can we talk about this later?
cause you'll be in a much better mood once I get Greta off my list.
no, no list!
you need to decide what's more important,
me or that damn list?
Yeah, here's the thing.
if I pick you, Karma's never gonna let us get along, but if I pick the list, you're gonna go even more psycho on me, but Karma can fix that. So...
I'm gonna go with the list.
wrong answer.
if I wanted Karma to make Billie nice again,
I need to convince Greta the outside world was evil.
and that is when I said, "Excuse me, Sir, but that is not a bottle opener."
so, you dance for men?
just for money?
I dance, I jump, I grind.
I once hung upside down and let a man throw bologna at me.
Hello?
Hey, Earl, Joy would like a word with you, and based on her tone, I think it's gonna be a curse word.
Earl, you son of a bitch! You better get your...
that's a phone. Isn't it cool?
how does it work?
nobody knows.
I didn't believe what Joy told me until I saw it with my own eyes.
that bitch wife of yours tied a rope to your car and flipped my trailer back over.
I don't get it, if Billie's mad at me, why would she take it out on you?
where is she? I am so angry, I just want to beat her with my tiny little fists.
that's right, let it out, Cricket.
you're never gonna believe what Billie did.
it's not often we get to meet one of Kenny's girlfriends.
you are Kenny's girlfriend, aren't you?
I'm not sure I'm Kenny's type.
here, see for yourself.
please tell me he's blowing up a man-shaped balloon.
Earl, she told my parents she is going to undo your entire list.
the list!
Billie must've stolen it.
looks like there's a monster loose in Camden.
then I guess...
we're going monster hunting.
Yeah!
sorry.
I stepped on a nail.
once we figured out that Billie was trying to undo everything on my list,
Darnell helped us set up what he called a command center.
I put pins in the locations where she's already struck.
it will help us figure out where she's going to hit next.
according to my calculations, the only place I know for sure is safe is Pop's Hot Dog Cart.
Billie just burned down Pop's Hot Dog Cart.
all right, I was guessing, but damn, what are the odds?
Greta, she just wrote that in ink, right?
watch this.
are you magic? - Yes.
no, Greta, it's a dry erase marker, and they're evil, and you can get high from sniffing them.
I'll show you. - Randy, put it down.
Hey, Earl, thanks to your wife, our neighborhood's crawling with tourists.
everybody wants to see "freak town."
some guy tried to put me in a BabyBjorn.
I hate Austin Powers.
Hey, look there's a couple of freaks right now!
it's Horn Head and Tiny Guy.
feel free to point and laugh, as they do not have emotions like you and I.
we were trying hard to figure out who else she was gonna hit.
turns out, the real question was, who wasn'tshe gonna hit?
she got Didi.
she got Mistletoe the Stripper, first day back to work at Club Chubby without her back brace.
another one bites the dust...
she even made a recording of Nescobar-A-Lop-Lop, so he could hear his own accent.
Oh, God, that's what I sound like?
people should make fun of foreigners.
another one bites the dust.
and before I knew it, it seemed like I had the whole town in front of me.
people, people! I'll fix it all.
I'm doing my best.
Hello?
Earl, it's Billie.
you got to stop this, Billie.
Hey, you like spending time with your list so much, now you get to start all over again.
it's not right. You're hurting innocent people.
speaking of innocent, someone wants to talk to you.
we went shopping, Earl, and now we're having fast food.
I just ate beef that I didn't have to raise, name, and look in the eyes as I smashed its head with a killing hammer.
it's delicious!
Randy, I told you to watch Greta.
I did. I watched her go out the door and to the vending machine.
she's so cute, I can't take my eyes off her.
Oh, you meant watch, like keep track of her.
that, I did not do.
Billie, I swear, if anything happens to that girl...
it'll be your fault, Earl.
you made me do this when you chose your list over me, so if you keep doing your list,
I'll keep making bad things happen to people on it.
Oh, my God, she's talking about us!
that's when I realized, there was only one thing left to do.
so, for the last time, Earl, what's it gonna be
me or the list?
okay, Billie, I choose you.
I couldn't believe I had to give up my list, but I hoped if I could get Greta back to the Camdenites,
karma would make everything okay.
glad you finally manned up and did right by your wife, Earl.
Where's Greta?
I left her at Chubby's Burgers.
what do you care? You're here for me, not her, right?
see, now you're not even giving us a chance.
you didn't even bring her.
how do you expect Karma to do anything good for us?
screw Karma.
you shouldn't have said that.
Why? What's gonna happen to me?
you called the cops?
I- I didn't, I swear.
then who did? Karma?
it wasn't Karma. It was something much scarier than that.
there's the trailer-flipping whore.
there she is.
look, she's making a run for it.
tase the bitch! Tase her!
Hey, Earl. - Hey, Crab Man.
I trusted you.
you said you were putting me first.
well, now, I'm putting you first on my list..of people to kill..
that's a death threat.
I know for a fact that you can arrest her just for saying that and keep her for 24 hours without even pressing charges or letting her call her kids to say good night.
I can't. She just stepped on Camdenite property.
it's a sovereign land. Camden Police have no jurisdiction.
we try to keep that under wraps.
otherwise, all the criminals would hide out there.
good. Then I'll just hide out here.
see?
when you least expect it...
...I'll be coming for you, Earl.
don't worry, buddy. I'm gonna be out here 24/seven to nab her as soon as she leaves.
actually, 24/5.
in five days, it's the department bass fishing trip, which is gonna be a blast, but it'll leave us a little shorthanded.
I had five days to find Greta and convince her to return to the Camdenites, so Karma would be happy.
now, it wasn't just to save my relationship.
it was to save my life.
here, Greta!
here, Greta, Greta, Greta, Greta!
but she was nowhere to be found.
and after searching around the clock for five days,
I knew I was screwed.
Hey, Earl!
good luck!
[Lost: little woman in long dress (sorry no picture) Please return to Palm hotel]
I was out of time.
Billie could be coming for me any minute,
I still didn't know where Greta was.
turns ordinary water into champagne.
Greta, where-where have you been?
Randy's been hiding me.
damn it, Randy, you know my situation with Billie.
if Greta doesn't go back, I can't fix my Karma with women.
what about me?
everything's always about you and your list.
when I do I get a turn?
I don't have bad Karma with women, so why should I have to lose Greta to help your problem with Billie?
besides, I want to stay out here in the land of zippers and mirrors and tampons that are not made out of hay.
come on, Grettie.
you can't decide to change your whole way of life just based on a few days.
you changed your life in just one day, Earl, and that was right for you.
I said something smart, didn't I?
Oh, you always say something smart, Randy.
maybe Greta wasn't supposed to help me fix my Karma with women.
maybe she was part of Randy's Karma, rewarding him for being a good guy.
and that meant I needed to come up with something else to make things up to the Camdenites, but it was hard to think about that when I was worried about Billie being on the loose.
I knew I had to stay awake and keep an eye out.
wakey, wakey. Life's at stakey!
this time, I knew I wasn't dreaming, and Billie still had her key.
quick! Just pretend we're pillows.
it's okay.
I'm not here to hurt you.
then-then what's with the ax?
all Camdenite women carry them for protection when we leave the farm.
I suggested pepper spray, but it turns out, we Camdenites don't believe in spray... or pepper.
we Camdenites?
it seemed the Camdenites didn't have a problem with Billie using their land to hide out from the police.
but they did have a problem sharing their land with someone not willing to share the work.
and while it took some getting used to, she soon found that field work was a great way to get out her anger.
in fact, it made her feel pretty good.
been there one time Been there two times...
and, when she fell back into her stealing ways, it didn't work, 'cause in the Camdenite village, all the property was shared.
you can have it.
been there one time...
and even though she was used to being selfish, it was hard to be greedy around people who were so happy to give.
never going back again. Country road. Take me home. To the place...
Billie had spent her whole life searching for something.
she tried crime, nursing school, and then she met me, and tried Karma.
but nothing felt right... until now.
take me home. Country road...
I guess Karma didn't want to turn you into another me, after all.
I was just supposed to help you find the real you.
and now you could cross the Camdenites off your list.
but first divorce papers.
uh...you need to sign...
I know where to sign.
Thanks, Earl.
what's this?
maybe Karma didn't want me to be your reward, but it still wanted you to have one.
do good things.
dear Mr. Rockefeller, this $72, 000 is the remainder of my insurance settlement.
it would be more if you didn't double up on the tissues.
I think this money was always meant for you.
love, Billie.
I was glad Billie found where she belonged.
after I had spent time in prison...
after I doubted Karma and got hit by a car...
after lying for a pretty good while in a coma...
...I had my list again,
I was finally back where I belonged.
cheap SHIRT.
why DO I EVEN BOTHER?
Henry's LOOK DOESN'T SUIT YOU.
what's THE HURRY?
my APPOINTMENT SECRETARY, HENRY, HAS SCHEDULED ME TO PICK UP HIS DAUGHTER FOR SOCCER PRACTICE.
and HOW IS THE MISSUS?
Why? YOU JEALOUS?
I KNOW SHE'S JUST A JOB.
it's ALWAYS A JOB.
and YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
I HAVE TO GO.
and WHEN I GO, YOU GO.
Hey, BABE.
uh, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?
I'm ACTUALLY AT THE DENTIST.
uh, REALLY? WHAT, OUR DENTIST? THE ONE IN-- THE ONE IN BRENTWOOD?
Yeah, DR. WHITE.
he's REDOING THE OFFICE. YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THE NOISE.
Henry, I GOTTA GO.
um, I THINK THEY JUST CALLED MY NAME AT THE RECEPTIONIST.
can I CALL YOU LATER?
sure.
okay, BYE, HONEY.
Ruthy, SORRY I'M LATE. YOU READY?
what ARE YOU DOING?
nothing.
what ARE YOU TRYING TO HIDE THERE?
nothing.
come ON, LET ME SEE. - OKAY.
what IS IT?
Ruthy, THIS BELONGS TO YOUR MOTHER.
if YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR MOTHER'S STUFF, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK
because RIGHT NOW YOUR TENDENCY TO STEAL THINGS IS VERY CUTE,
but AT 18 IT BECOMES A FELONY.
I'm PRETTY SURE IT'S A MISDEMEANOR, DAD.
these ARE PICTURES OF YOUR MOM AND ME FROM COLLEGE.
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN THESE BEFORE.
Hey, DID YOUR MOM SAY WHERE SHE WAS GOING THIS MORNING?
hmm, NO.
all RIGHT.
let's PUT THIS STUFF AWAY AND HIT THE FIELD.
Oops.
um, RUTHY, I HAVE TO CLEAN THIS MESS UP, ALL RIGHT?
I'll MEET YOU BY THE CAR.
can I CHECK THIS?
go AHEAD. THE MEAT SHOULD BE DONE.
Hey, YOU.
so HOW WAS THE DENTIST?
Oh, FINE.
mom, THIS DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.
why ARE WE EVEN DOING THIS?
I'm NOT GOING TO COLLEGE FOR, LIKE, THREE YEARS.
because IT'S IMPORTANT YOU LEARN HOW TO COOK FOR YOURSELF.
why DON'T WE JUST START OUT WITH SOMETHING LIKE PASTA?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT OSSO BUCO IS.
Henry, TELL THEM ALL I ATE IN COLLEGE WAS CEREAL AND RAMEN.
I WAS DISGUSTING. - I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.
actually, EVERYBODY WAS PRETTY SURPRISED YOUR MOM PAID ANY ATTENTION TO ME AT ALL.
that's NOT TRUE.
okay, IT'S A LITTLE TRUE.
Where'd YOU GUYS MEET AGAIN,
like A FRAT PARTY OR SOMETHING?
no, ACTUALLY, YOUR FATHER WAS DATING MY ROOMMATE SARAH.
such A BALLER, DAD.
EW, IS THIS SUPPOSED-- - OKAY, YOU LITTLE CRITIC.
move.
Jack, I'M YOUR MOTHER.
trust ME, IT'S GONNA BE FANTASTIC.
it JUST NEEDS TO COOK A LITTLE MORE.
I HAVE LEARNED A THING OR TWO SINCE COLLEGE.
have YOU EVER BEEN IN LOVE, DR. SKINNER?
Janus DOESN'T OFFER MUCH ROOM FOR LOVE.
you KNOW THAT, HENRY.
Angie IS MY HOME. I CAN'T LOSE HER.
what MAKES YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO?
for YEARS I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST MY THERAPIST.
it TURNS OUT YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE INVOLVED THAN THAT.
I NEED YOU TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST WITH ME.
is ANGIE PLAYING SOME KIND OF PART IN THIS?
is SHE A SPY?
is THERE A REASON THAT YOU SUSPECT HER?
because IF YOU THINK SHE'S INVOLVED IN SOMETHING,
you CAN TELL ME.
no, NO, NO, NO.
no, I'M JUST, UH, I'M BEING PARANOID.
hmm.
the ONLY WAY I'LL KNOW ANGIE'S REAL IS BY SOLVING THIS CODE.
but IF YOU FOUND OUT FIRST, EDWARD,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'D DO.
I DO KNOW YOU'LL NEVER OPEN THIS BOOK.
place THIS HERE.
going TO PLACE THIS...
Hey.
daddy's LITTLE GIRL.
Oh, DID RUTHY TELL YOU ABOUT HER LOWER BACK TATTOO?
I ACTUALLY THINK A DRAGON IS PRETTY CLASSY.
well, YOURS GETS A LOT OF ATTENTION.
how's IT GOING WITH YOU AND MARY?
I'm STILL ON THE COUCH.
it CAN TAKE A LONG TIME TO GET OVER BEING BETRAYED.
I KNOW.
I REALLY SCREWED THIS UP, HENRY.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW IT CAN GET BETTER.
you THINK YOU COULD FORGIVE ANGIE IF SHE DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS?
boys, YOU'RE NEEDED IN HUMAN RESOURCES.
you GOTTA STOP DOING THAT.
what?
what AM I DOING?
has NO ONE EVER TOLD YOU THAT YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO HOVER?
no.
gentlemen.
this IS SERIK SHEFER.
he's RUNNING IN THE UPCOMING KAZAKH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,
and HIS SAFETY IS YOUR NEW TOP PRIORITY.
general RAVIL CHELYAKOV HAS BEEN RUNNING UNOPPOSED IN EVERY ELECTION SINCE THE BREAK-UP OF THE SOVIET UNION.
but SHEFER HAS BEEN ON A GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN
championing KAZAKH INDEPENDENCE FROM RUSSIAN OIL INTERESTS.
kazakhstan's GOT OVER 4 BILLION TONS OF PROVEN OIL RESERVES.
by 2015, THEY'LL BE PRODUCING MORE THAN 3 MILLION BARRELS A DAY.
they COULD BE THE NEXT SAUDI ARABIA.
SHEFER'S ELECTION MEANS EVERYTHING TO US.
right NOW ALL OF KAZAKHSTAN'S CRUDE IS PIPED TO RUSSIA FOR REFINING,
but SHEFER WANTS TO BUILD KAZAKH REFINERIES
and PROVIDE JOBS FOR HIS PEOPLE.
I LOVE IT WHEN WE HELP THE PEOPLE.
TRUMBULL WANTS MY TOP MEN ON THIS.
to THE BEST OF HIS KNOWLEDGE, THAT'S THE TWO OF YOU.
are YOU KIDDING?
this GUY TEARED UP WHEN WE DROVE THROUGH INGLEWOOD ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT.
I THINK WE'LL BE FINE, RAYMOND.
you GOTTA START WEARING A BELL.
the ELECTION'S IN THREE DAYS.
your JOB IS SIMPLE-- MOVE SHEFER TO OUR SAFE HOUSE
before CHELYAKOV HAS A CHANCE TO GET TRIGGER-HAPPY.
done.
SHEFER'S MEN WILL MEET YOU AT HIS FLAT IN ASTANA.
apres VOUS.
you FIRST.
if HENRY WAKES UP, I WANT A CLEAR SHOT AT YOUR HEAD.
looks LIKE CHELYAKOV'S MEN GOT HERE FIRST.
we're TOO LATE.
high OR LOW? - HIGH.
where IS SERIK?
are YOU OKAY?
they TOOK MY HUSBAND.
are YOU FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE, MISS SHEFER?
please, CALL ME MARIAM.
I REALLY DON'T REMEMBER MUCH.
the LAST TIME I SAW SERIK HE WAS ON THE BALCONY.
who DO YOU WORK FOR?
we're WITH U. S. INTELLIGENCE. WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.
your FOCUS SHOULD BE ON MY HUSBAND.
do YOU EVEN KNOW IF HE'S ALL RIGHT?
we're GETTING INTEL THAT GENERAL CHELYAKOV'S MEN ARE HOLDING HIM
in ONE OF THEIR COUNTRYSIDE ESTATES.
okay, I'M READY. TRANSFER NOW.
a LETTER WAS PUT OUT BY SHEFER CONCEDING THE ELECTION.
CHELYAKOV FORCED HIM. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
I'll COORDINATE A PICKUP.
we're GONNA BRING YOU BACK TO THE U. S.FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.
no, NO, WE'RE WASTING TIME.
we PUT A TEAM ON GENERAL CHELYAKOV.
we'll GET YOUR HUSBAND BACK.
you HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME. THE GENERAL DIDN'T TAKE MY HUSBAND.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
the KGB TOOK HIM.
they DON'T WANT TO MAKE A MARTYR OUT OF HIM BEFORE THE ELECTION,
but IN THREE DAYS THEY WILL KILL HIM, EDWARD.
how DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?
because I AM KGB.
my NAME IS MARIAM SHEFER.
I'm A KGB SLEEPER AGENT ASSIGNED TO SERIK SHEFER.
I'm HIS WIFE. I LOVE HIM.
and IF YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ME, HE'S GOING TO DIE.
we DON'T KNOW WHO THIS WOMAN IS. WE NEED MORE INFORMATION
what's HER PAST, WHO'S SHE'S WORKED FOR.
Tony's PULLING UP EVERYTHING HE CAN NOW
from OUR KGB BACK CHANNELS.
what MORE DO WE NEED TO KNOW?
she WAS SCREWING WITH SHEFER FOR STATE SECRETS
and NOW SHE'S SCREWING WITH US.
I'm NOT SO SURE.
there IS A POSSIBILITY THIS WOMAN FELL IN LOVE.
no, IT CAN'T BE THAT SIMPLE.
there's SOMETHING SHE'S NOT TELLING US.
well, IF SHE HAS A CONTACT THAT CAN GIVE US SHEFER'S LOCATION,
why DOESN'T SHE JUST TELL US INSTEAD OF DEMANDING?
that WE FOLLOW HER BACK TO RUSSIA?
miss SHEFER.
we HAVE MEN NOW ON THE GROUND AT CHELYAKOV'S CAMP OUTSIDE ASTANA.
but UNTIL WE CAN CONFIRM YOUR STORY,
we WAIT.
confirm MY STORY? I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.
you HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.
miss SHEFER
No! NO! NO, PLEASE, HE'LL BE DEAD BY THEN.
what's GOING ON? WHO'S THAT?
we CANNOT WASTE ANY MORE TIME.
please.
what DO YOU THINK OF ALL THIS?
I MEAN, THE WOMAN LIES TO HER HUSBAND FOR 16 YEARS.
I MEAN, THAT MEANS THAT EVERY NIGHT SHE SLEPT IN HIS BED, IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE LIE.
well, USUALLY NO ONE ASKS MY OPINION.
but, UM, I GUESS I'D SAY IT'S THE WORLD WE LIVE IN.
okay, MAVIS ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING WE HAVE ON MARIAM SHEFER.
Oh, THANKS.
actually, CAN I ASK YOU A FAVOR?
okay, SO THIS GOES IN
Nope.
switched ON. OKAY.
daddy.
Ah, YEAH, SWEETIE?
can YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE SOUL MATE?
what? OH, THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING A SOUL MATE,
that YOU HAVE JUST ONE.
is MOM YOURS?
Yeah, OF COURSE SHE IS.
but THE OTHER DAY MOM SAID THAT YOU DATED HER ROOMMATE.
Oh, RIGHT.
is THIS HER?
Yes, IT IS.
but I--I
I DATED SARAH WAY BEFORE YOUR MOM AND I WERE EVER TOGETHER.
we WERE BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND. IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.
did YOU LOVE HER?
Yes, I DID.
but, UH,
she DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT.
that's SAD.
Yes, IT IS.
but SOMETIMES WHEN THINGS HAPPEN LIKE THAT,
it CAN TAKE YOUR LIFE IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION.
so AFTER SARAH DIED,
your MOM AND I, WE REALLY STARTED TO DEPEND ON EACH OTHER,
and THEN, WELL, WE FELL IN LOVE.
uh, DON'T YOU HAVE SOME HOMEWORK TO DO?
Yeah, I GUESS.
Thanks, DAD.
love YOU.
won't BETRAY MY HUSBAND.
that's HOW I FEEL.
I'm NOT A TRAITOR.
fine, I HAVE 15 MINUTES. WHERE ARE YOU?
at INDUSTRIAL AND MATEO.
okay, I'LL BE THERE.
Hey, I'M JUST CALLING TO SAY GOOD NIGHT.
I GOT CALLED OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS LAST MINUTE.
you DID, RUTHY? THAT'S GREAT.
uh, NO, NO, YOU, UH
you DON'T HAVE TO PUT YOUR MOM ON THE PHONE.
just TELL HER I SAID GOOD NIGHT.
love YOU TOO.
Angie LOVES HENRY.
do YOU KNOW ABOUT ANGIE,
if SHE'S REAL OR A PLANT OR
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M
I'm SURE YOU DON'T FEEL ANY OBLIGATION TO TELL ME ANYTHING.
I KNOW I'M NOT GOOD AT THINGS LIKE YOU ARE.
I CAN'T SHOOT A GUN LIKE YOU.
I CAN'T TORTURE INFORMATION OUT OF PEOPLE.
but, UH...
I AM GOOD AT BEING WITH HER.
I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.
eh.
I FIGURED YOU'D COME BACK.
I GOT A LITTLE HELD UP.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, EDWARD.
and HOW IS THAT?
because YOU'VE ALREADY KILLED TWO OF MY DEAR FRIENDS TRYING TO FIND IT.
we BOTH KNOW YOUR PARENTS DIDN'T DIE IN A CAR ACCIDENT.
and WE BOTH KNOW THAT SOMEBODY IN YURI'S UNIT KILLED THEM.
so TELL ME, MARIAM, WAS IT YOU?
no, BUT I CAN HELP YOU.
my KGB CONTACT MAY KNOW WHERE SERIK IS.
I'm LISTENING.
if YOU GET ME OUT OF HERE AND HELP ME FIND MY HUSBAND,
I'll TELL YOU WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO YOUR PARENTS.
my CONTACT'S NAME IS VLADIMIR.
he IS AN INFORMATION BROKER.
he'll KNOW WHERE SERIK IS LOCATED.
and WHEN MY HUSBAND IS SAFE, I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO FIND YOUR PARENTS' KILLER.
why THE TRAIN?
Vlad WILL ONLY DO BUSINESS IN TRANSIT AND THIS IS OUR BEST OPTION.
no PASSPORTS.
no PASSENGER LISTS.
no METAL DETECTORS.
tell ME, EDWARD,
how DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU FIRST REALIZED THE KGB WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF YOUR PARENTS?
probably NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THEN HOW SERIK WILL FEEL WHEN HE DISCOVERS HIS ENTIRE MARRIAGE IS A LIE.
I LOVE SERIK. WHY ELSE WOULD I BE HERE?
I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU LOVE HIM OR NOT.
I'm HERE FOR INFORMATION.
no, YOU ARE HERE TO PUNISH WHOEVER MURDERED YOUR PARENTS.
there's A DIFFERENCE.
when THEY DIED, THEY GAVE YOU SOMEONE TO HATE.
and AN ENEMY CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL IN OUR LINE OF WORK.
be HONEST, EDWARD,
don't YOU EVER WONDER ABOUT THE LIFE YOU COULD HAVE HAD?
no, I DON'T.
this SEEMS A LITTLE PRIVATE FOR AN INFORMATION EXCHANGE.
well, VLADIMIR IS A BARTERER.
you HAVE TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING.
you HAVE TO TRUST ME.
here's YOUR AMERICAN OPERATIVE.
I've KEPT MY PROMISE.
now WHERE'S SERIK?
the ELECTION'S TOMORROW NIGHT. I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
I RARELY SEE YOU SO TIGHTLY WOUND, MARIAM.
if YOU REALLY CARE FOR YOUR HUSBAND, IT COULD GET YOU IN TROUBLE.
where IS HE?
is HE ALIVE?
they're STILL HOLDING HIM IN KAZAKHSTAN
at THE KGB BASE IN BAIKONUR.
I CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON YOU, VLAD.
have FUN WITH HIM.
Oh, VLAD,
the KEY.
I TOLD YOU I ALWAYS KEEP MY END OF THE BARGAIN.
I CAN SEE THAT.
Vlad LIED.
they WOULD NEVER KEEP HIM IN BAIKONUR.
half THE MEN THERE ARE KAZAKH LOYALISTS.
the KGB CLEARLY OUTBID US.
should I BE OFFENDED?
no, IF THEY WERE WILLING TO PAY HIM,
that MEANS THAT VLAD KNOWS HIS LOCATION.
he USUALLY CARRIES AN UNTRACEABLE SD CARD WITH ALL HIS INTEL.
get OUT OF THE WAY.
here.
if I FIND THE CARD, WE CAN FIND SERIK.
I NEED TWO MINUTES.
I DON'T HAVE TWO MINUTES.
I've GOT THE INFORMATION.
let's GO.
Yes, IT IS. TOM?
guess AGAIN.
Oh, RAYMOND, THANK GOD.
Edward's GONE ROGUE.
I'm ON A TRAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF SIBERIA WITH THAT KGB AGENT.
I JUST CAME TO IN THE MIDDLE OF A BAGGAGE CAR SURROUNDED BY DEAD BODIES.
all RIGHT, CALM DOWN.
Edward's NOT STUPID ENOUGH TO PUT HIS LIFE ONLY IN YOUR HANDS.
I'm FOUR CARS BACK.
where ARE WE GOING?
we're GOING TO GET SHEFER FROM THE KGB.
I BUGGED MARIAM'S CABIN.
best I CAN TELL THEY'RE HOLDING SHEFER UNDER THE TEREM PALACE AT THE KREMLIN.
the KREMLIN? I'M NOT GOING THERE.
does MAVIS KNOW ABOUT THIS?
who DO YOU THINK ACTIVATED ME?
now, A TAIL ON CHELYAKOV DIDN'T TURN UP ANYTHING.
so MARIAM'S OUR ONLY LEAD ON SHEFER.
but KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT ABOUT IT.
she STILL THINKS SHE AND EDWARD ARE FLYING SOLO.
and WE'RE STILL NOT SURE WE CAN TRUST HER.
you're NOT SURE YOU CAN TRUST HER?
I'm SURE I TOLD YOU GUYS SOMETHING LIKE THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.
I MUST BE ON RECORD SOMEWHERE SAYING
Hello?
Hello?
someone IS TRYING VERY HARD TO REACH YOU.
would YOU JUST LEAVE ME ALONE FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?
wait.
when THEY SET YOU UP WITH SERIK,
how DID THEY DO IT?
they CHOSE ME
because I FIT HIS TYPE.
25 YEARS AGO HE WAS A PROFESSOR.
they PLACED ME AS ONE OF HIS GRADUATE STUDENTS.
they PLACED YOU?
how CAN YOU SAY YOU EVER LOVED HIM?
it ALL STARTED WITH A LIE.
what? DOESN'T IT ALWAYS?
don't YOU SAY YOU LOVE THEIR FAVORITE AUTHOR
when YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM?
you SAY YOU'RE OPEN TO HAVING CHILDREN WHEN YOU KNOW YOU AREN'T.
but THEN YOU YOU GROW AND LEARN.
and ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU FIND YOU CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THE PERSON WHO STARTED OFF AS JUST AN ASSIGNMENT.
who's CALLING YOU?
my WIFE.
I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED YOU AS A HUSBAND.
do YOU LOVE HER?
more THAN ANYTHING.
she's THE ONLY PERSON I THOUGHT I COULD COMPLETELY TRUST.
and YOU'VE NEVER LIED TO HER, NEVER KEPT ANYTHING FROM HER.
where DOES SHE THINK YOU ARE RIGHT NOW, EDWARD?
talk TO HER.
be RIGHT BACK.
Henry, ARE YOU OKAY?
Yeah, I'M FINE.
I've BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU.
uh, I KNOW. I'M JUST, UH, AWAY ON BUSINESS.
listen, HENRY, I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS IN PERSON, BUT, UM,
do YOU REMEMBER MICHAEL?
we DATED FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS MY FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE.
do YOU REMEMBER HIM?
Yeah.
he ASKED ME TO LUNCH A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,
and I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS A BIG DEAL THEN,
so I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
but I THINK THAT HE SAW IT AS SOMETHING MORE.
he GAVE ME SOMETHING.
it WAS A NECKLACE.
and I TOOK IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHY. I WAS JUST--I WAS SO FREAKED OUT.
but YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT I TOLD HIM THAT NOTHING WAS GONNA HAPPEN.
Henry, ARE YOU THERE?
Yeah.
um, I'M HERE.
it's OKAY, ANGIE. IT DOESN'T MATTER.
none OF THAT MATTERS.
I'm SORRY, HENRY.
it's ALL GONNA BE OKAY, ANGIE.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU TOO, HONEY.
you SAID YOU WERE FOUR CARS BACK, WHERE
what THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
are YOU TRYING TO GET ME MADE?
I AM THROUGH WITH THIS, WITH EVERYTHING.
that's IT, I QUIT.
you CAN'T QUIT.
she's A SPY, RAYMOND.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'm TALKING ABOUT ANGIE.
tell ME SOMETHING, RAYMOND,
what HAPPENED TO YOU THAT SCREWED YOU UP SO MUCH
that YOU JOINED AN ORGANIZATION LIKE THIS?
Henry, BEFORE THIS YOU WERE CRUNCHING NUMBERS AND PLAYING FANTASY FOOTBALL.
right NOW YOU'RE ON A TRAIN TO MOSCOW TO MAKE SURE A DEMOCRATIC ELECTION TAKES PLACE.
you DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS ELECTION.
you'd JUST AS SOON KILL SERIK AS SAVE HIM.
all YOU CARE ABOUT IS FOLLOWING ORDERS.
you BETTER NOT FOLLOW ME, RAYMOND.
otherwise, IT'LL BLOW YOU COVER, AND GOD KNOWS ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS THIS JOB.
Oh, GOD.
this IS YOUR FAULT.
you AND THAT SICK ORGANIZATION YOU'RE A PART OF.
you WANTED TO MAKE SURE ANGIE WAS IN MY LIFE
so SHE COULD CONTROL ME, CONTROL MY FAMILY.
you PLACED HER.
you WERE AROUND IN COLLEGE WHEN I WAS DATING SARAH.
was HER CAR ACCIDENT EVEN AN ACCIDENT
or WAS SHE MURDERED LIKE YOUR PARENTS?
did JANUS KILL HER, EDWARD?
did YOU?
was THIS ALL SOME SORT OF BIG PLAN SO THAT I'D FALL IN LOVE WITH ANGIE?
well, GUESS WHAT, IT WORKED.
I DO LOVE HER.
Edward, IT'S TIME.
let's GO.
MARIAM'S LOCATING OUR WAY INTO THE KREMLIN NOW.
all RIGHT, I'M PICKING UP YOUR TRACER. I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU THE WHOLE TIME.
you TALKING TO YOURSELF?
I've GOT A LOT ON MY MIND.
Oh.
you KNOW, WHEN I JOINED THE KGB,
they TOLD ME I WOULD NEVER HAVE A REAL PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP AGAIN.
that WAS PART OF THE AGREEMENT.
was IT?
tell ME, WHEN YOU TRACK DOWN YOUR PARENTS' KILLER,
when YOU GET YOUR REVENGE,
what IS LEFT?
what DOES IT MATTER IF YOU HAVE NO ONE TO COME HOME TO?
I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I've BEEN ON A MISSION WHERE I FELT NERVOUS.
two TICKETS.
any EXCUSE FOR A PARTY.
it's BEING HELD IN THE OLD ARMOURY BUILDING.
it's STILL CONNECTED TO THE REST OF THE KREMLIN.
so I HOPE YOU BROUGHT YOUR TUX.
our TARGET'S NIKOLAI YELIKOV, THE BILLIONAIRE HUMANITARIAN.
as FAR AS THE PUBLIC'S CONCERNED, YES.
but BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, HE'S A DIRECTORATE CHIEF OF THE KGB.
so HOW DO WE PERSUADE HIM TO GIVE US ACCESS
to THE TUNNELS THAT LEAD TO SERIK?
nikolai HAS THE SAME WEAKNESS AS ANY MAN.
Oh, GOOD.
the KIND OF MISSION A FEMALE SPY CAN REALLY SINK HER TEETH INTO.
sure YOU GOT ENOUGH FIRE LEFT IN THAT FURNACE?
towering INFERNO.
this IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL THE FABERGES.
and AS WE SAY IN RUSSIAN...
come! YOU MUST SEE, HUH?
paying FOR HALF OF THE PARTY HAS ITS PERKS.
well. - YEAH?
if YOU INSIST. - I DO INSIST.
is THIS MAN YOUR HUSBAND?
no, NO, NO, BORIS IS MY GODSON.
Really? - YES.
you KNOW SOMETHING, I THINK I'LL GO TOO.
can I GET EITHER OF YOU SOME PUNCH?
uh, CATIA,
perhaps YOU WOULDN'T MIND GETTING THE PUNCH, HMM?
not AT ALL.
thank YOU.
that WAS FAST.
should I BE IMPRESSED OR DISAPPOINTED?
let's GO.
good.
there ARE 38 DOORS THAT SEAL OFF THESE TUNNELS TO THE KREMLIN.
now THAT SHOULD GIVE US ACCESS TO MOST OF THEM.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
they SAID YOU WERE DEAD.
we GOTTA MOVE.
we HAVE TO GO.
let's GO.
he's WITH US.
well, THEN TELL HIM TO RUN.
the KGB KNOWS WE'RE HERE.
let's GO.
if WE GET THROUGH THIS DOOR, IT'LL TAKE US TO THE RIVER.
there's A VAN WAITING FOR US TWO BLOCKS DOWN FROM THERE.
it's NOT WORKING.
try IT AGAIN!
we've GOTTA MOVE NOW OR WE'RE GONNA BE TRAPPED.
I GOT IT!
move! MOVE!
I LOVE YOU.
I SAID WE GOTTA MOVE. COME ON! COME ON!
go.
go. - NO, MARIAM!
No!
no, MARIAM!
No!
No!
what DO YOU THINK THIS IS BETWEEN US?
hello TO YOU TOO.
Henry EXISTS FOR A REASON,
to HAVE A FAMILY, TO FEEL LOVED.
he PROVIDES THESE THINGS FOR ME SO I DON'T NEED THEM.
I DON'T WANT THEM.
Where's THIS COMING FROM?
is THIS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MARIAM SHEFER?
when I JOINED THIS PROGRAM, I WAS TOLD I WOULD NEVER HAVE A REAL RELATIONSHIP AGAIN.
that's WHAT I AGREED TO.
having SOMEONE TO COME HOME TO ONLY COMPLICATES MY LIFE,
complicates MY JOB.
Edward, WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M ASKING FOR?
I KNOW WHAT WE HAVE. I KNOW IT'S NOT REAL.
I AM WILLING TO MAKE MY LIFE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED.
what IS IT?
are YOU ALL RIGHT?
are YOU OKAY?
Oh, GOD, YOU GOT TO HAND IT TO HIM, HENRY'S GOT IMPECCABLE TIMING.
I'm SORRY.
Dr. SKINNER?
Hello, HENRY.
were YOU JUST WITH EDWARD?
well, I CALLED FOR YOU.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS GETTING.
what HAPPENED IN RUSSIA?
SERIK WAS RESCUED.
mariam DIED TO SAVE THE MAN SHE LOVED.
I've BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT THE CONVERSATION WE HAD A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.
so HAVE I.
I ALREADY KNOW EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ANGIE.
did YOU KNOW JANUS KEEPS A FILE ON EACH OF US?
our HABITS, OUR HISTORIES, OUR FAMILIES.
downstairs YOU'LL FIND AN UNMARKED DOOR.
inside IS A SECURE COMPUTER SYSTEM.
that's WHERE YOU'LL FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
her CODENAME WAS CELANDINE. BUT YOU KNEW HER AS SARAH ROGERS.
recruited IN 1989,
her PRIMARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO START A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.
what ABOUT THE CODED PHOTOS THAT I FOUND AT THE HOUSE?
they WERE SARAH'S.
she COMMUNICATED WITH JANUS THROUGHOUT YOUR COURTSHIP.
Angie DID KEEP SOME OF HER THINGS AFTER SHE DIED.
but WHAT ABOUT THE ACCIDENT?
it WAS JUST THAT, AN ACCIDENT.
Henry, YOUR LOVE FOR ANGIE WAS UNPLANNED AND UNEXPECTED.
she WAS YOUR CHOICE,
not THEIRS.
why ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS NOW?
because I REALIZE THAT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW
whether OR NOT THEIR LOVE IS REAL.
thank YOU.
Hi.
I've BEEN SITTING HERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY I LIED TO YOU ABOUT MICHAEL.
cause WE STARTED TALKING A FEW MONTHS AGO,
and I SHOULD HAVE JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT IT THEN.
but HE WAS AN EX, AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO
did SOMETHING HAPPEN?
no, HONEY. NO, NOTHING HAPPENED.
I THINK I JUST APPRECIATED THE ATTENTION.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG BETWEEN US.
it's JUST...
I THINK WE WERE JUST IN A RUT.
we WERE IN A RUT?
I THINK THAT WE STOPPED NOTICING EACH OTHER, YOU KNOW?
but YOU GOT US OUT OF IT.
but, LIKE, A MONTH AGO IT'S LIKE YOU STARTED TO MAKE LOVE TO ME AGAIN.
it HAD BEEN SO LONG SINCE YOU LOOKED AT ME LIKE THAT,
since YOU TOUCHED ME LIKE THAT.
it WAS LIKE IT WAS NEW,
like WE WERE US AGAIN.
I AM SO SORRY.
if I EVER MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WEREN'T NOTICED.
you ARE MY BEST FRIEND.
and TRUST ME, I NOTICE YOU.
Oh, HONEY.
I LOVE YOU. - I LOVE YOU TOO.
I KNOW THIS MESSAGE IS GOING TO GIVE YOU TREMENDOUS JOY,
which IS WHY I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE IT,
but I FEEL OBLIGATED TO THANK YOU.
you MIGHT HAVE VAGUELY HELPED MY MARRIAGE,
and I APPRECIATE THAT.
I NEED TO TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MYSELF
for HOW I TREAT THE PEOPLE I LOVE.
I REALIZED TONIGHT THAT YOU AND THE ORGANIZATION AREN'T THE ONLY ONES THAT CAN SCREW UP MY LIFE.
I CAN TOO.
and MY FAMILY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD TO ME.
the THING IS, I THINK MAYBE THE SAME IS TRUE FOR YOU.
I FOUND THIS.
I THINK IT'S ABOUT YOUR PARENTS, BUT I HAVEN'T LOOKED INSIDE.
I've ASKED YOU TO STAY OUT OF MY FAMILY LIFE, EDWARD,
you BRAINWASHED ME?
brainwashing IS SOMETHING THEY DO IN THE MOVIES.
we MANIFESTED A SPLIT PERSONITY.
talk TO ME, TO - NAME'S NOT TOM.
I DIDN'T VOLUNTEER! - NO, YOU DIDN'T. BUT EDWARD DID.
your PAREN WERE NOT KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT.
they WERE MURDERED.
I BECAME A SPY SO I COULD FIND THE SPY WHO MURDERED THEM.
you SURE YOU WANT TO CROSS THIS LINE?
I'm NOT READY TO BURN AN ASSET AS VALUABLE AS EDWARD.
at LEAST, NOT YET.
you MURDERED THEM.
I'm ON VACI STREET.
perfect.
CESNIK IS SET TO MEET HIS BUYER
in FRONT OF THE HOTEL VADAS IN THE NEXT FOUR MINUTES.
we HAVE SECURITY VIDEO OF CESNIK CHANGING TRAINS IN BUCHAREST.
he's GOT THE WARHEAD WITH HIM IN A BRIEFCASE.
uh, GOT HIM.
I IMAGINE MOLDOVA'S NOT GONNA BE TOO HAPPY
when THEY DISCOVER THE DEFENSE MINISTER'S SELLING OLD SOVIET WEAPONS ON THE BLACK MARKET.
good WORK, AVENGER. THESE PHOTOS'LL PUT CESNIK AWAY FOR A LONG TIME.
any SIGN OF THE BUYER?
not YET.
whoop.
Hey, UH, WOULD YOU MIND IF I GOT A PHOTO OF YOU GUYS
for A MAGAZINE ARTICLE ON TOURISM?
how DID YOU KNOW WE'RE TOURISTS?
Oh, JUST A GUESS.
Ah, LOVELY.
thank YOU SO MUCH.
THERE...TONY, GET AN I. D. ON THE BUYER.
uh, HE'S, UH, HE'S NOT IN OUR SYSTEM.
give ME A SECOND.
who AM I LOOKING AT?
this IS WEIRD. THE IMAGE MATCHED TO A GUY BY THE NAM OF DANIEL SHAW.
it SAYS HERE HE'S EX-D. O.D.
most OF HIS FILE'S BEEN REDACTED. WE DON'T HAVE CLEARANCE.
get ELIZABETH Q OVER AT D. O.D. ON THE PHONE.
avenger, CHANGE OF PLANS.
the BUYER IS AMERICAN, EX-INTELLIGENCE.
we JUST DON'T KNOW WHETH HE'S WITH US OR AGAINST US.
do NOT ENGAGE. REPEAT, DO NOT ENGAGE.
UH...YEAH!
Yeah, UH UH, MY COMMS WENT DEAD FOR A SECOND.
please REPEAT.
stay ON SHAW, AVENGER, BUT KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.
uh, SHAW, RIGHT. GOT IT, GOT IT.
uh, TARGET'S ON THE MOVE.
with A BRIEFCASE.
okay, SHAW IS AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY.
and WHILE THE WARHEAD ALONE ISN'T DANGEROUS,
we ARE CONCERNED WITH WHAT HE MIGHT DO WITH IT.
avenger?
20 YEARS AT THE D. O.D.
I DITCHED OUT REPORT AFTER REPORT...
Ahh! GOD!
potential TERRORIST ATTACKS.
no ONE CARED.
now I BECOME ONE...
they FINALLY START TO LISTEN.
I COULD HAVE KILLED YOU BACK THERE.
but I WANNA KNOW WHO YOU'RE WORKING FOR.
WHO...DO YOU WORK FOR?
you're NOT STUFFY ENOUGH TO BE N. S.A.
no C. I.A. SWAGGER.
so...
let ME BE MORE SPECIFIC THIS TIME.
tell ME WHO IT IS YOU'RE LISTENING FOR, OR...
I WILL KILL YOU.
Aah! NO!
NOW...LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.
WHO...DO YOU WORK FOR?
S-SALVATION ARMY.
well, THAT'S TOO BAD.
cause WHILE I WANT THIS INFORMATION,
I DON'T REALLY NEED IT.
there's A BODY IN HERE. COME PICK IT UP.
Oh, GOD.
yes?
hey...it's ME.
thank GOD YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.
where IS SHAW?
target's IN THE WIND.
contact INTERPOL.
but LISTEN TO ME FIRST.
I THINK I FIGURED IT OUT.
I KNOW HOW HENRY AND I CAN BE FIXED.
I WOKE UP WHEN SHAW ELECTROCUTED ME.
it WASN'T CHANCE.
the SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN YOU USED THE DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES ON HIM IN THE AMBULANCE.
Edward, WE'VE TRIED HITTING THE CHIP WITH ELECTRIC PULSES BEFORE TO REBOOT IT.
nothing's EVER WORKED.
Yeah, BUT WE'VE NEVER USED ANYTHING THAT STRONG.
the OUTLET WAS 220 VOLTS.
50's ENOUGH TO KILL SOMEONE.
it's TOO RISKY.
I UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE DOING IT
to KEEP TRUMBULL FROM DISCOVERING THAT I'M BROKEN.
but SOONER OR LATE, HE IS GONNA FIGURE IT OUT,
and THEN HE'S GONNA KILL ME.
unless HENRY BEATS HIM TO IT.
no, THIS IS A CHANCEAT A REAL FIX.
TRUMBULL'S TALKING TO D. O.D. ABOUT SHAW.
if WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS,
we NEED TO DO IT NOW-- CALL NORA.
if WE'RE GONNA FRY YOU,
it CERTAINLY DOESN'T HURT TO HAVE A DOCTOR ON HAND.
no RAYMOND?
why NOT GET THE WHOLE TEAM TOGETHER?
we'll HAVE A BARBECUE.
Raymond's IN BOSTON RIGHT NOW ON LEGITIMAT AJ SUN BUSINESS.
pole DANCING SHOULD DEFINITELY BE IN THE OLYMPICS.
like SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING.
but WIOUT THE WATER.
or THE SUITS.
Hey, TOMMY...
how 'BOUT ANOTHER ROUND?
Ah, NO PROBLEM.
that's WHA THE CORPORATE CARD IS FOR.
Hi. ANOTHER ROUND, PLEASE.
Yes.
HEY...DO I KNOW YOU?
I DON'T THINK SO.
you SURE?
cause YOU LOOK REAL FAMILIAR.
you FROM AROUND HERE? - NOPE.
I NEVER FORGET A FACE.
sorry, BUDDY, I CAN'T HELP YOU OUT HERE.
I'm NOT WHO YOU THINK I AM.
here YOU GO.
take IT EASY.
Cheers.
that GUY HAVE A TAB GOING?
Yeah, OF COURSE.
can I SEE HIS I. D. PLEASE?
thank YOU.
I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THIS, EDWARD.
this ISN'T ABOUT YOU.
electroconvulsive THERAPY CAUSES SEIZURES.
it CAN TURN YOU INTO A VEGETABLE IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL.
then BE CAREFUL.
I've SHUT DOWN SECURI FEEDS TO THIS ROOM FOR THE NEXT 20 MINUTES.
Edward's VITALS LOOK GOOD.
and I'VE GOT A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE BLOOD FLOW PATTERNS IN HIS BRAIN.
it SHOULD TELL US WHEN HENRY WAKES UP.
are YOU SURE? - YES.
uh, YOU SEE,
this IS EDWARD, THIS IS HENRY.
they're THE SAME PERSON,
even BRAIN ACTIVITY IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
so IF EDWARD SWITCHES TO HENRY,
all THIS TURNS YELLOW.
Yeah.
okay, UH, WE'RE A GO WHEN YOU'RE READY.
I'm READY.
does THIS MEAN IT'S WORKING?
uh, NO, YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PARIETO-INSULAR CORTEX.
it's THE PAIN CENTER OF THE BRAIN.
uh, STILL NO SIGN OF A SWITCH.
this IS TOO MUCH FOR HIM! WE SHOULD TURN IT OFF NOW!
uh, YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.
his HEART'S NOT HANDLING THIS WELL.
if WE HAVEN'T SEEN A SWITCH BY NOW, IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
turn IT OFF!
he WAS WRONG.
it WASN'T WRONG TO HOPE THAT THIS COULD WORK, EDWARD.
you're NO WORSE OFF THAN YOU WERE THIS MORNING.
I KNOW, THIS MORNING HENRY ALMOST GOT ME KILLED.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MIRACLES I HAVE LEFT.
then TEACH HIM. HE CAN LEARN.
Oh, PLEASE.
every MISSION I GO ON IS A SUICIDE MISSION WITH THIS GUY,
and THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.
and IF YOU COULD?
what IF HENRY WASN'T YOU, BUT JUST SOME MAN?
I'd KILL HIM.
what ARE YOU THINKING?
good AFTERNOON, HENRY.
I've BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO WAKE UP.
as YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE STILL ALIVE,
no THANKS TO YOU.
but IF WE'RE GOING TO SURVIVE,
things HAVE TO CHANGE.
specifically, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE.
pick UP THE PISTOL ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF YOU.
when YOU WAKE UP ON MISSIONS,
you CAN'T DEPEND ON ME,
or SOON ENOUGH, YOU'LL GET US BOTH KILLED.
if THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, IT MIGHT AS WELL BE NOW
when NATIONAL SECURITY WON'T BE COMPROMISED.
so I'VE HIRED AN ASSASSIN TO KILL US.
What?! - HE'S ALREADY HERE.
in LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES, HE'LL FIND YOU.
if YOU CAN MAKE IT OUT OF THIS PLACE ALIVE,
you're HOME FREE.
it's EITHER YOU OR HIM, HENRY.
I HOPE YOU CHOOSE YOU.
your TIME TRYING TO FIND AN EXIT.
I've WELDED THE DOORS SHUT.
you SON OF A-- - AND THERE'S NO WINDOWS.
that's WHY I CHOSE IT.
okay.
nice TRY, EDWARD.
if I DIE, YOU DIE.
and IF THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW YOU CARE MORE ABOUT ANYTHING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD,
it's YOURSELF.
so I'M NOT PLAYING YOUR STUPID LITTLE GAME, OKAY?
I AM CALLING YOUR BLUFF.
Ohh! JEEZ!
you ALWAYS SEEM TO BRING ME BAD NEWS, ALISTAIR.
most NEWS IS BAD NEWS.
what's THE PROBLEM?
my PEOPLE CAN'T SEEM TO ACCESS A D. O.D. PERSONNEL FILE
for THE FORMER G. S.A DIRECTOR DANIEL SHAW.
well, WE QUIETLY PUT HIM OUT TO PASTURE A YEAR AGO.
he WAS EXTREMELY CRITICAL OF D. O.D. POLICIES FOLLOWING 911.
specifically, THE PATRIOT ACT.
Shaw's A CONSTITUTIONALIST?
Oh, QUITE THE CONTRARY.
he THINKS THE PATRIOT ACT'S A SLAP ON THE WRIST.
when HIS RECOMMENDATIONS TO BOLSTER DISCRETIONARY POWERS WEREN'T HEARD,
he WENT ROGUE.
well, THEN, I'M AFRAID THIS MAY BE THE BAD NEWS.
Shaw JUST PURCHASED AN ALAZAN-5 WARHEAD.
his FOCUS AT D. O.D. WAS ON R. D.D. ATTACK PREVENTION.
he KNOWS AN ALAZAN WARHEAD CONTAINS ENOUGH RADIOACTIVE STRONTIUM AND CAESIUM
to MAKE THREE DIRTY BOMBS.
if HE WANTS TO PROVE HOW WEAK OUR DEFENSES ARE,
he'll ATTACK A U. S. TARGET ABROAD.
everyone KNOWS...
policy DOESN'T SHIFT UNLESS AMERICANS DIE.
I'm GIVING YOUR PEOPLE LEVEL 8 CLEARANCE TO THE D. O.D. MAINFRAME AND ALL FILES ON SHAW.
find HIM.
where ARE WE ON SHAW'S FILES?
well, I LINKED INTO D. O.D.'S MAINFRAME,
and I'M CROSS-REFERENCING SHAW'S REPORT ON U. S. VUERABILITIES ABROAD
against STRATEGIC TARGETS FOR A SUITCASE BOMBING.
what's OUR TIME FRAME?
uh, I SHOULD THINK AT LEAST SIX HOURS TO MINE THE DATABASE.
and, UH, LISTEN, UH...
there's, UH, ONE OTHER THING.
I THINK I FIGURED OUT A DIFFERENT WAY TO ACTIVATE THE SWITCH BETWEEN EDWARD AND HENRY.
but, UH...IT'S RISKY.
he ALMOST DIED THE FIRST TIME.
I KNOW.
set IT UP...DISCREETLY.
maybe NEXT CHRISTMAS WE SHOULD GET SOME STUFF FOR THE KIDS TOO.
which ONE OF YOU BEAUTIFUL LADIES IS MARY GRADY?
who's ASKING?
name's GREENE.
I GO WAY BACK WITH YOUR HUSBAND RAYMOND.
but HE GOES BY TOM NOW, RIGHT?
I've NEVER HEARD ANYONE CALL HIM RAYMOND.
well, MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR HUSBAND AS WELL AS YOU THINK YOU DO.
excuse ME?
Yeah, I RAN INTO HIM IN BOSTON AT A STRIP JOINT, OF ALL PLACES.
and HE WAS HAVING A HELL OF A TIME.
you KNOW, I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE.
Hey.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
do YOU KNOW THIS GUY?
easy, RAYMOND.
I WAS ST CHATTING IT UP WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIFE.
my NAME IS NOT RAYMOND.
Tom, WHAT'S GOING ON?
Yeah, TOM.
why DON'T YOU TELL HER WHO YOU REALLY ARE?
it's NOT OFTEN YOU GO TO SEE A DEAD MAN.
I'm NOT A DEAD MAN. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
you're GOOD, RAYMOND.
when SULLIVAN GETS IN, YOU DROP THE ACT.
he DOESN'T ENJOY GAMES AS MH AS I DO.
all RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA CALL THE POLICE.
no NEED. I WAS JUST LEAVING.
nice TO MEET YOU LADIES.
Raymond, I'LL SEE YOU SOON.
are YOU OKAY? DID HE DO ANYTHING TO YOU?
did YOU MEET HIM AT A STRIP CLUB, TOM?
did YOU LIE TO ME?
Yes, BUT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME, I
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BELIEVE YOU ANYMORE.
in LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES, HE'LL FIND YOU.
if YOU CAN MAKE IT OUT OF THIS PLACE ALIVE,
you're HOME FREE...
please, I DON'T WANNA DO THIS.
I've GOT A WIFE AND TWO KIDS NOT MUCH YOUNGER THAN YOU!
Oh, JEEZ.
Hey.
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU HOME.
are YOU OKAY?
honey, WHAT HAPPENED?
Oh, IT'S NOTHING. IT'S JUST BEEN, UH...
it's BEEN A REALLY BAD DAY.
I, UH, I GOT INTO A FIGHT AT WORK TODAY.
a PHYSICAL ONE?
almost.
with WHO?
it's NOTHING. IT'S STUPID. IT'S, UH...
I JUST GOT REALLY SCARED.
well...
being SCED IS WHAT KEEPS YOU FROM GETTING HURT.
I WASN'T AFRAID OF BEING HURT.
well, THEN, WHAT WERE YOU SCARED OF?
I WAS AFRAID I WANTED TO HURT HIM.
I WANTED TO KILL HIM.
it's ONLY HUMAN TO FEEL LIKE YOU WANNA KILL SOMEONE, HENRY.
but FEELING LIKE IT AND NOT DOING IT IS WHAT KEEPS US FROM BECOMING MONSTERS.
and YOU'RE NOT A MONSTER.
is THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANNA TELL ME?
cause IF YO NEED ANYTHING...
I'm HERE.
I NEED YOU.
can't WE JUST STAY IN BED ALL DAY?
that WOULD BE NICE.
do YOU WANNA TELL ME WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WITH THE GUY AT WORK TODAY?
ang, I CAN'T NOW. IS THAT OKAY?
sure.
actually, NO.
you KNOW, I ALWAYS ASK YOU... HOW YOUR DAY WAS.
and YOU GIVE ME THIS VAGUE EXPLANATION.
and IT'S NOT OKAY, HENRY.
I MEAN, LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING TO TOM AND MARY.
come ON, THAT'S NOT US.
I KNOW, BUT IT COULD BE.
he DOESN'T TELL HER ANYTHING ANYMORE.
he's LIED SO MUCH THAT...
even I BELIEVED THIS GUY THAT WAS HARASSING US THIS ORNING WHO WAS ACCUSING TOM OF...
not BEING WHO HE SAID HE WAS.
w-wait.
uh, WHO DID THINK TOM WAS?
he KEPT CALLING HIM RAYMOND.
so YOU KNOW THESE GUYS?
Yep. YEP?
Raymond, AFTER BEING TORTURED AND TRAPPED ON A BOAT WITH A TRAINED ASSASSIN,
I JUST LEFT MY WIFE IN A NICE, WARM BED TO WARN YOU ABOUT THIS.
so ALL I GET IS A "YEP"?
Yep.
listen TO ME.
these GUYS THREATENED TOM, MARY, AND MY WIFE.
so YOU BETTER TELL ME WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON.
it's MY SITUATION.
I'll HANDLE IT.
well, YOU BETTER HANDLE IT, OR I'LL-- I'LL TELL MAVIS!
Ooh.
Oh, UM, HEY, UH... WE FIGURED IT OUT.
figured WHAT OUT?
how TO FIX YOU.
what?
Oh! HENRY.
Hey, UM, OKAY, LISTEN. UH, WHEN YOU WERE ASLEEP,
we CONDUCTED THIS EXPERIMENT,
which WE BELIEVED WOULD FIX THE SWITCH BETWEEN YOU AND EDWARD.
it DIDN'T WORK.
but I THINK I FIGURED OUT WHY.
wait, WAIT-- ARE YOU TELL ME THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE?
no EDWARD, NO JANUS, NO MISSIONS?
if IT WORKS, YEAH.
you JUST MADE MY DAY.
Oh, ALL RIGHT.
Mmm! COME ON.
edward WAS RIGHT ABOUT SHAW TRIGGERING A SWITCH.
he WAS JUST WRONG ABOUT HOW IT HAPPENED.
see, THE ICE YOU WERE SUBMERGED IN MAY HAVE DROPPED YOUR CORE TEMPERATURE BELOW 84 DEGREES.
so, CLINICALLY, HE DIED.
exactly.
with NO ELECTRIC CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH THE BRAIN TO POWER THE CHIP,
it TURNED OFF.
then WHEN SHAW ELECTROCUTED HENRY,
it REBOOTED AND WOKE EDWARD UP.
so WE'RE MIMICKING HIS DEATH TO TRY TO FIX HIM-- BRILLIANT IDEA.
it's REALLY NOT SO BAD, ONCE...YOUR LEGS GO NUMB.
are YOU HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS?
no, COURSE NOT. UHH!
I'll SLEEP BETTER AT NIGHT KNOWING MY FAMILY'S SAFE FROM ME.
the SOONER EDWARD'S OUT OF MY LIFE, THE SOONER...UH...
he STOPPED SHIVERING.
that MEANS HE'S REACHED LEVEL THREE HYPOTHERMIA.
Henry, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
Ah, HIS PULSE RATE'S DROPPED TO 46, BUT HE'S STABLE.
we're READY.
his OVERALL BRAIN ACTIVI IS DECLINING FROM THE COLD.
but WE'LL STILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE SWITCH HERE.
if EDWARD WAKES UP IT'LL TURN YELLOW AND STAY THAT WAY.
start THE E. C.T.
okay, HENRY, HERE WE GO.
what's HIS STATUS?
uh, STILL NO CHANGE.
his CORE TEMP'S FALLING. WE NEED TO UP THE VOLTAGE.
turn IT OF - WAIT, HOLD ON A SECOND. - TURN IT OFF!
he's FLAT-LINING!
we NEED TO GET HIM OUT NOW!
lift.
easy. WATCH HIS HEAD.
what DID YOU SEE ON THAT SCREEN, TONY?
I DON'T KNOW.
I've NEVER SEEN A BRAIN DO THAT BEFORE.
I SUGGEST YOU FIGURE IT OUT.
Edward. - UHH!
I THOUGHT THAT WAS IT,
that I'D ABLE TO COME HOME TO ANGIE WITHOUT ANY MORE BURDENS.
that I'D BE GIVEN SOME IMPLANTED ANSWERS FOR ALL OF HER QUESTIONS.
ignorance ISN'T ALWAYS BLISS.
I JUST WANT THINGS TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THEY WERE.
you SEEM QUITE SURE OF THAT.
I AM.
Henry, CAN YOU HONESTLY TELL ME THERE'S NO PART OF YOU THAT THOUGHT YOU MIGHT MISS THIS?
miss KNOWING WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU DAY TO DAY?
it's UNDERSTANDABLE.
you WERE MADE FROM EDWARD. YOU'RE PART OF HIM.
no, NO. THAT--THAT PSYCHOPATH JUST LOCKED ME IN AN ABANDONED SHIP WITH AN ASSASSIN.
but YOU GOT OUT.
I've BEEN YOUR THERAPIST FOR TEN YEARS,
and I CAN SAFELY SAY TWO MONTHS AGO YOU WOULD HAVE DIED ON THAT SHIP.
Ah, COME ON.
Henry, YOU'RE CHANGING, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.
you DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME.
what ARE YOU SO AFRAID OF?
Edward's NOT THE MONSTER YOU THINK HE IS.
edward LURED HIM TO THE UNITED STATES.
maybe YOU DIDN'T TAKE HIM DOWN, BUT THE C. I.A. DID.
trust ME, I KNOW EDWARD'S BY NO MEANS A PERFECT MAN, BUT...
I'll LET THAT LAST COMMENT SLIDE BECAUSE, SOMEHOW, I'M STILL ALIVE.
it's TIME WE FIGURED OUT A CODE WORD, DON'T YOU THINK?
Yeah.
Tony's TEAM SCOURED SHAW'S FILES AND FOUND FIVE PROBABLE LOCATIONS FOR HIS NEXT ATTACK.
we've ALREADY RECOVERED ONE BOMB EN ROUTE TO THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN ANKARA
in A DIPLOMATIC POUCH.
so THERE'S STILL FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FOR THE REMAINING BOMBS.
they're ALL PLACES SHAW WARNED US WOULD BE VULNERABLE
when HE WAS GLOBAL SECURITY DIRECTOR AT D. O.D.
I WANT A TWO-MAN TEAM IN EACH LOCATION.
you TWO WILL GO TO THE AMERICAN SCHOOL IN DUBAI,
and WE'LL COORDINATE WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM HERE.
will's UP IN 30.
I NEED YOU TO FLY SOLO ON DUBAI.
no WAY. I'M NOT ASKING.
I NEED TIME OFF THE GRID, AND I NEED IT NOW.
the ONLY REASON I'M AWAKE IS FOR THE MISSION,
and I GOTTA TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.
cause IF I DON'T, TWO GUY WILL PUT A BULLET IN TOM'S HEAD.
his FAMILY TOO.
you're GOING SOFT ON THEM.
unlike YOU, I DON'T BELIEVE OTHER PEOPLE SHOU DIE FOR MY MISTAKES.
take IT UP WITH MAVIS. - LOOK,
these GUYS WHO FOUND ME...
I STOLE A LOT OF MONEY FROM THEM A LONG TIME AGO.
I KILLED A FRIEND OF THEIRS.
Yeah.
you JOINED JANUS TO AVENGE YOUR PAST?
I EDED TO ESCAPE MINE.
and, AS YOU KNOW...
Janus DOESN'T TAKE TOO KIND TO CRIMINALS.
fine.
Thanks, PAL.
I'm ON THE PREMISES.
copy, AVENGER.
boy SCOUT?
his COMMS WENT DOWN IN TRANSIT.
route ALL COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH ME.
u. S. INTELLIGENCE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
this BUILDING, THIS SCHOOL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE EVACUATED THIS MORNING.
the POLICE SAID IT WAS CLEAR.
they CALLED US BACK AN HOUR AGO. - THERE'S BE A MISCOMMUNICATION.
you NEED TO GET THESE KIDS OUT OF HERE.
is THERE ANYBODY ELSE IN THE BUILDING?
the ENTIRE SCHOOL' IN SESSION.
well, LET'S GET 'EM OUT. COME ON.
okay, LET'S GO.
somebody PLEAS EXPLAIN TO ME WHY I'M LOOKING AT A CLASSROOM FULL OF CHILDREN.
evacuation PROCEDURES FOR THE SCHOOL ARE HANDLED JOINTLY BY THE U. S. EMBASS AND THE DUBAI POLICE FORCE.
we SOUND THE ALARM. THEY DO THE CLEANUP.
when D. P.F.'s BOMB SQUAD CLEARED THE SCHOOL,
they CALLED IT BACK INTO SESSI WITHOUT OUR GO-AHEAD.
get THEM ON THE PHONE.
this IS EXACTLY WHAT SHAW ANTICIPATED.
finding LOOPHOLES LIKE THIS WAS HIS JOB.
well, LET'S FIND HIM.
okay...
there ARE THREE LOCATIONS WITHIN THE SCHOOL
where THE DIRTY BO CAN INFLICT THE MOST DAMAGE.
lead THE WAY, TONY. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
Raymond CARTER RISES FROM THE GRAVE.
Greene TOLD ME, BUT THIS I HAD TO SEE FOR MYSELF.
it's BEEN A LONG TIME, LEO.
no MORE GAMES, TOM.
well, YOU'VE REALLY DONE WELL FOR YOURSELF, HAVEN'T YOU?
wife, KIDS.
basketball HOOP.
you GOT THE WHOLE DEAL, DON'T YOU?
What'd YOU DO, TURN STATES?
get INTO SOME KIND OF WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM?
somethin' LIKE THAT.
case YOU'RE WONDERING...
the ONLY REASON YOU'RE NOT DEAD YET
is BECAUSE I WAN MY MONEY BACK...
with INTEREST, OF COURSE.
of COURSE.
you GET ME THAT,
and GREENE'LL ONLY KILL YOU.
if YOU DON'T,
he'll DO YOUR WIFE TOO.
possibly THE KIDS.
we'll PLAY THAT ONE BY EAR.
I GOT YOUR MONEY.
well, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
not HERE.
you KNOW, YMOND-- - IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA GET IT, LEO.
fine.
Griffith PARK.
at 10: 00.
Shaw's MOST LIKELY TARGET IS THE ASSEMBLY ROOM.
it's IN THE CENTER OF THE SCHOOL
and WOULD MAXIMIZE CASUALTIES AS WELL AS MAKE A STATEMENT.
what ARE YOU DOING?
let's GET YOU OUT OF HERE.
the MAN SAID I NEED TO STAND HERE.
what MAN?
the BOY STAYS. AH AH!
I'll SHOOT HIM FIRST.
toss THE WEAPON...AWAY.
avenge WHAT'S YOUR STATUS?
let THE BOY GO, SHAW.
we GOT SHAW.
reroute ALL OF OUR RESOURCES TO DUBAI, IMMEDIATELY.
okay, NOW,
I CAN BE OUT OF HERE IN SEVEN MINUTES.
but I DON'T THINK ALL THOSE KIDS CAN.
so...
TOSS...THE GUN...DOWN!
okay, OKAY. IT'S GOING DOWN.
there IT IS. YOU SEE?
you HAVE EXACTLY THREE SECOND-UHH
to TELL ME WHERE THE BOMB IS.
Uhh! OH, CRAP.
the SCHOOL IS FULLY EVACUATED.
but IF THAT BOMB GOES OFF,
the RADIATION IS STILL GONNA TAKE OUT THOUSANDS OF THEM.
avenger, HAVE YOU LOCATED THE BOMB?
avenger, DO YOU READ ME?
listen TO ME VERY CAREFULLY.
if YOU DO NOT FIND THE LOCATION OF THIS BOMB AND DISENGAGE IT,
thousands OF PEOPLE WILL DIE OF RADIATION POISONING.
you ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DO THIS.
no ONE IS COMING TO HELP YOU.
no ONE CAN GET TO YOU IN TIME.
avenger, YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING NOW.
now, WHERE IS THE BOMB?
tell ME, OR I SWEAR TO GOD, I'LL KILL YOU!
seat 5-A.
u. S. INTELLIGENCE!
D. P.S. BOMB SQUAD. DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?
seat 5-A.
this IS AVENGER.
we GOT THE BOMB.
good WORK.
good WORK, EVERYBODY.
okay...
I JUST GOT CONFIRMATION FROM THE DUBAI POLICE FORCE.
the BOMB IS SAFELY OFF-SITE.
they ARE DEFUSING IT NOW,
and THE RADIATION WILL BE CONTAINED.
good JOB, EVERYBODY.
Hey, I JUST GOT HOME. WHERE ARE YOU?
I'll BE THERE SOON. I RAN TO THE STORE FOR SOME ICE CREAM.
you WANT ANYTHING?
uh, NO, I'M GOOD. - YOU SURE?
Yeah. THANKS.
I'll SEE YOU SOON.
onstar CENTER. - THIS IS TRINA.
how MAY I HELP YOU?
uh, HI, THIS IS MARY GRADY.
um, HEH, I'M SO EMBARRASSED.
but I CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE I LEFT MY CAR LAST NIGHT.
no PROBLEM, MRS. GRADY.
I SEE YOU'RE CALLING FROM YOUR HOME LINE,
so WE VERIFIED YOUR IDENTITY.
I'll BE HAPPY TO LOCATE THE VEHICLE FOR YOU.
can YOU GIVE ME THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER, PLEASE?
Yes, IT IS 2BRI 564.
it WILL JUST BE A MOMENT WHILE WE LOCATE THE VEHICLE.
Thanks.
What'd YOU FIND?
okay, I LOOKED AT THE FINAL THREE SECONDS OF THE EXPERIMENT AT LEAST 100 TIMES.
and THEN I SLOWED IT DOWN...
and SAW THIS.
you SEE, EDWARD WOKE UP.
and THEN HENRY, AND THEN EDWARD.
I MEAN, THEY WERE SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH SO FAST,
looked LIKE THE WHOLE BRAIN WAS ACTIVE.
you KNOW, IT WAS JUST BY CHANCE WE ENDED UP WITH HENRY.
if WE WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE E. C.T. A MOMENT LATER,
we WOULD HAVE ENDED UP WITH EDWARD.
so WE CAN CHOOSE WHO TO WAKE UP?
Yes! YES, IT WORKS.
it CAN ALL GO BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS.
well, I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D SHOW.
thought YOU'D RUN, LIKE LAST TIME.
I'm NOT THE GUY I USED TO BE.
I DON'T RUN ANYMORE, NOT FROM GUYS LIKE YOU.
open YOUR JACKET.
is THAT MY MONEY?
it's EVERYTHING I OWE YOU.
it's EMPTY.
what?
you KNOW, YOUR MISTAKES ARE ALWAYS GETTING OTHER PEOPLE KILLED.
it's TOO BAD. I LIKED YOUR WIFE.
she HAD A TON OF BALLS.
after ALL THESE YEARS, YOU STILL DON'T CARRY A GUN.
do YOU, LEO?
Yeah, THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH GUYS LIKE YOU.
you NEVER WANNA GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY.
why DON'T WE JUST FORGET ABOUT THE WHOLE THING?
consider IT FORGOTTEN.
walk WITH ME, HENRY.
you REALLY PROVED YOURSELF OUT THERE.
edward COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT BETTER.
whew, THANK YOU.
however, WE WON'T BE NEEDING YOU ANYMORE.
what, ARE YOU GONNA KILL ME?
no, HENRY.
we're GONNA FIX YOU.
but THAT EXPERIMENT DIDN'T WORK.
Tony's FOUND A WAY.
well, UH, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE HAPPIER.
me TOO, I JUST...
there WAS SOMETHING IN ME THAT I'D NEVER FELT BEFORE.
I MEAN, IT SCARED ME, BUT IT'S THERE, IT'S REAL.
maybe IT'S BETTER TO GET TO KNOW THE MONSTER THAN TO PRETEND IT DOESN'T EXIST.
I'm NOT SURE I WANT THINGS TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THEY WERE.
I DON'T WANT AN ARTIFICIAL LIFE.
I DON'T WANNA BE LIKE TOM.
I DON'T WANT YOU PEOPLE DECIDING THE KIND OF MOOD
I'm GONNA BE IN WHEN I COME HOME TO MY WIFE
or WHAT I'M GONNA SAY, HOW I'M GONNA FEEL.
ANGIE...SHE DESERVES MORE THAN THAT.
HENRY...I'M SORRY I GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU HAD A CHOICE IN ALL THIS.
cause YOU DON'T.
your VERY EXISTENCE IS A RISK TO NATIONAL SECURITY.
this ENDS...TONIGHT.
Tony's WAITING.
Tony, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Oh, MY GOD.
how COULD THIS HAPPEN?
nobody COULD GET IN HERE!
unless THEY WORK FOR THE COMPANY.
you THINK SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE DITHIS?
Yes.
and THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO BE FIXED.
you are not gonna get away with this.
I went to see Rafe Castle for help, help to fix what's wrong with us!
you may have created me in some sick, twisted way.
I may have come from you, but you are a monster, and I swear to god I am going to kill the monster!
Rafe Castle would still be alive if you hadn't gone to see him.
think about that, Henry. Own that.
you exposed your friend to information that could compromise national security.
the minute he saw the chip in your head, he'd seen too much.
I don't know how many times i'm gonna have to tell you this, Henry.
you can't talk about Janus to anyone!
did you see the paper yet?
uh, no. Why, what's up?
Rafe Castle was murdered last night.
I can't believe it.
you just went to see him.
do they know who did it?
they said that some drugs were taken. They think it might have been a robbery.
it could have happened while you were there.
a friend of mine was killed last night.
I hadn't seen him since college.
I went to see him the other day and now he's murdered.
how much of what I say here is confidential?
I'm your therapist, Henry.
what you tell me is privileged.
Yeah, but you work for the company.
my job is to help AJ Sun employees stay healthy.
I think I know who killed him.
have you told the police?
no, because the killer, we are-- Uh, we're close.
and, uh, if I turn him in, it'll destroy my life.
Henry, this is important.
is this person an imminent threat to you?
no, I don't think-- No, he won't-- He won't do anything to me.
and to anyone else?
I don't think so.
I need to go to the cops, don't I?
look, Henry, I'm your doctor.
you are my concern.
if you were telling me someone was in imminent danger, then, yes,
I would tell you you have to go to the authorities.
and if that's not what i'm telling you?
I'm not saying you shouldn't go to the police. In the end, that may be my recommendation.
but my job is to help make your life better, not to destroy it.
you say that's what would happen if you turned this person in, your life would be destroyed.
what do you mean by that?
that is, uh... Difficult to explain.
well, then maybe that's where we should start.
thank god you're home.
listen, I've been gone all day.
I took food over to Rafe's instead of flowers. That's better, right?
anyway, I just got home and something's wrong with the fridge.
and Mary called all hush-hush wanting me to come by asap.
so, is there any possible way that you could pick out a new fridge when you take Ruthy to the mall?
I really need your help on this.
excuse me, mom.
okay, yeah. I'll call a repairman.
you are so cheap, dad.
we need a new fridge.
she's not wrong.
but if you think the repairman can handle it, by all means go ahead.
I'm late for practice.
honey, I know it's not every girl's dream to go dress shopping with her father, but he tries really hard, so give him the benefit of the doubt.
love you, mom. - Honey, trash.
burly needs to go for a walk.
Hey, Burly! Burly!
sorry, she's friendly.
how old is she?
she's six, but she still acts like a puppy.
german shepherd. - Real loyal dog.
Yeah, she is.
come on. You got to be careful where you place your loyalties. Am I right, Henry?
how did you know my name?
special agent banks, FBI.
O-kay.
you're probably thinking this has to do with your involvement in Rafe Castle's death.
my involvement? What? - I can assure you the FBI couldn't care less about a local murder rap.
we're interested in the people you work for.
the other people you work for.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think you do.
we can help. Henry, we can make this all go away.
uh...I'm sorry.
I really don't know what you think I know.
you have a good memory.
memorize this.
and call it if you change your mind. Okay?
this bat mitzvah is gonna be so boring.
don't say that. It'll be fun.
it'll be educational.
Oh, no.
Uh...listen, I need to check something.
I'll meet you by the door.
what do you have to do? - I will meet you by the door.
go, please. Please? - Okay.
you are taking my daughter, Ruthy, shopping to buy a new dress for Ella Salsberg's bat mitzvah.
Oh, god.
okay
you are taking my daughter, Ruthy, shopping to buy a new dress.
I'm up. - Good.
gael Ramirez is back on the radar.
he's selling schematics to a new gen russian nuke.
the Cossack?
I'm sure Gael is contacting beijing, Islamabad, anywhere else he thinks he can generate a bidding war.
he sent Garcia to gauge our interests.
what's a Cossack?
honey, I'm on the phone.
I'm with Ruthy.
I'll send someone else. - No, he's my client.
I'll handle it.
the meet's in 30 minutes at the marina. Slip 63.
honey, we're gonna have to run a few errands before we go shopping.
dad! - I'll make it up to you.
okay.
I need you in Mexico.
to babysit Edward.
ed made contact with his number two and set a meet with Gael.
where?
we only know the lz is in the western Sierra Madres.
edward will parachute in.
gael's men gave the coordinates and will make contact at 0400.
I need you to ride shotgun on this.
thanks for coming by, Ang. I know you're swamped.
Oh, sure. What's going on?
I was looking through recent searches on our browser, and I found this.
okay. Porn.
when if found this, I couldn't help but feel like maybe I wasn't-- It's stupid.
no, it's not stupid.
and I know Tom, and he loves you, Mary.
I know, and it's great when he's at home.
but when he's away and he checks in with me, it feels like it's a chore.
what are you doing tonight?
well, when I'm done here, I have to pick up Hannah from the tutor.
what if I picked up hannah?
what are you talking about?
I think that you should go surprise Tom.
no, I couldn't. - Yes, you could.
it's a two-hour flight to portland and seeing him will make you both feel better.
go get your hair done, buy some lingerie, go seduce your husband.
we have a situation.
Dr. Lance Deitrich, chief architect of the dod's cold fusion program.
he's missing. - Missing?
could be an accident.
could be he got turned.
I'm scrambling all hands on this one.
Raymond-- Raymond's going to Mexico.
Why? The Cossack?
gael is Edward's contact.
he'll just have to fly solo on this one.
you're on Deitrich.
go show your mom the dress.
you sure about this? - Go.
okay.
mom! Here's the dress that dad bought me.
Ruthy got the dress for her thing.
all is right with the world.
tell me, Henry, how do you handle living such an exciting life?
mom saw the dress.
Oh, uh... Did she like it?
$2, 000?!
for what? What, the fridge?
no, sadly you paid a whopping $150 to fix a fridge that's still broken, but somehow spent $2, 000 on a dress for a 12-year-old.
wait, I spent $2, 000?
Ruthy, get down here!
don't yell at her. You're the one with the credit card.
uh...I thought it was 200.
did you even look at it?
Oh, god! - This is a hoochie dress.
I will take it back. - You can't.
it's store credit only.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
does anyone else work at AJ Sun?
I didn't answer it.
this time. Once. You work all the time.
Henry, I've been thinking about this all day.
what happened to Rafe could happen to us.
you can't know when something terrible could happen that changes everything.
I agree, trust me. - Then be with me.
be with us.
don't be so distracted that you think a $2, 000 dress costs 200.
this is not okay.
so what if I talk to people about Janus, huh?
what does that mean, you're gonna hurt me?
well, let me remind you. I can hurt you, too.
I can make doing your job a little bit more difficult.
watch this. Watch.
here we go.
ready? Huh, you watching?
Yeah.
I know a broken fridge and shopping for my daughter's dress don't seem real exciting to you, but you're not even trying. How about this?
you start trying to do a good job as me, and I'll start trying to do a good job as you.
until then, I'm gonna kick back.
Oh, god.
we're over the Sierra Madres approaching the lz.
confirm with Garcia the location of the pickup.
Yeah, roger that.
Tony, I think my better half is coming.
has he ever jumped out of a plane before?
I don't think so.
makes sure he knows the color of the rip cord is...
Tony, what's going on?!
Henry, listen, two things.
one, there's a tablet in your pack.
it contains a mission download.
read it after you jump.
jump? What jump?!
that's the second thing.
Mr. Albright, it's time!
no, no, no!
I'm not jumping!
you have to jump now, sir!
no, no, no!
sierra MADRES MEXICO
a broken pinkie?
what are you, a cub scout?
still, you showed initiative.
I figured i'd reward that by skipping the pain meds.
now about kicking back, it's not happening.
now open the pack, take out the case, place your thumb on the bio-metric scanner.
this is Gael Ramirez.
and this is the hell he creates.
gael sells black market weapons.
he doesn't care about the cause, just the cost.
it's taken me years to gain Gael's trust, and this is our only chance to take advantage of that because mi-5 is about to take him down in an armed sting they're running in Bogota.
the man on his left is Garcia.
he made contact with me in Los Angeles about selling schematics to a russian weapon known as the Cossack.
when you have the schematics, Mavis will transfer six million into Gael's off-shore account.
Garcia is coming to bring you to Gael.
when you're with him don't ask about his family, don't engage in small talk.
he's probably the one person on earth less interested in what you have to say than me.
now put in your comms.
Mavis has probably passed a stone waiting to hear from you.
and remember, you never know who's listening.
this is avenger!
do you copy?
avenger, this is the Nest. We copy.
what's your sit-rep?
I'm just waiting to be picked up.
copy.
contact upon rendezvous.
get in.
Dr. Lance Deitrich, architect of the cold fusion program.
he's missing. This is Theresa Chu.
she and Deitrich were having an online romance which ended about a month ago.
the day after he disappears, she quits her job.
now she's on an evening flight to Honolulu.
see if she lead us to Deitrich.
here you go, Mrs. Grady.
the Oregon Hotel Portland
your husband hasn't checked in yet, but when he does we'll bring his bags up to the room.
Oh, he's probably at dinner with a client.
how late do you have room service?
1: 00 a. m. - Perfect.
and this is a surprise, so please don't let him know that I'm here.
don't worry. - Thank you.
vancouver International Airport
whose bag is this?
is there a problem? - I just need to check it, ma'am.
okay, these are cool.
it swabs on a liquid crystal that provides electronic feedback over a secure channel only we can lock into.
have a nice flight.
Yeah, hi. This is room 110.
has tom Grady checked in yet?
no? Okay, thank you.
Hey, this is tom.
please leave a message at the tone.
sierra Madres Mexico
Eduardo, welcome!
something's wrong.
they won't let you in without being searched.
it's sop. - Sop.
occupational hazard, my friend.
what's that?
this is the latest in scanning technology.
it's still in r&d, but I got my sources.
I can explain that.
Hey, it's your job and you do it well.
he did not.
come on, let's have a drink.
you and I are men of few words, Edward, so let's cut to it.
about the Cossack, what's your final offer?
did you know him? - Who?
the man you just killed.
the guard.
he was my cousin. - Did you like him?
I'm just curious where you draw the line between people you like and people you butcher.
you were never curious before.
well, I've never been surrounded by psychopaths before, so...
I know that you and Edward are men of very few words, but trust me, you are gonna want to hear this.
" you and Edward." You are Edward.
Yes, exactly.
I am Edward.
and because of that an old friend gets killed and the FBI thinks I did it, which I did and I didn't.
my wife is having sex with somebody else, but she's not.
Oh, and by the way, my boss gave me a heart attack last week because I refused to believe she put microchip in my brain that makes me a super spy with a split personality.
so whatever you're gonna do to me, let's just get it over with!
I never knew that you were such an unstable bastard.
I love that about you.
come on, come on, let me show you something.
see that horse over there?
cost me $300, 000.
Hi, mama!
you spent $300, 000 on a horse for your daughter?
I want her to have the best.
that's what you want. But what about what she wants?
why wouldn't she want the best?
I don't know.
maybe something so expensive-- Could be a horse, could be a dress.
maybe it embarrasses her or makes her feel like she's got to like it.
you won't know until you ask her.
so, ask her what she wants?
that's good.
that's good.
I heard you got into a run-in with the russian, Uzi Kafelnikov.
what happened?
can I tell you something?
sincere.
I never liked you.
I know, we did business all these years together, but you were always so uptight.
but now why don't you go to Bogota with us?
Mi-5's about to take him down in an armed sting they're running in Bogota.
Bogota.
mi-5 is running a sting down there.
be careful.
just watch your back.
I cannot believe this.
what? - A Vacheron Constantin.
there's only 15 of these in the world.
Really? - May I see it?
sure, be my guest.
I've never been able to find one.
then it is yours. I insist.
no, come on.
I'm gonna take advantage of you while you're drunk, Eduardo, but only because i'm a bad man.
thank you.
I'm gonna have to take this. Then we go for a ride.
I'll finish your drink.
Oh, go ahead.
you are so golden, thanks to me.
the g-man?
not a huge fan of yours. But me, he loves.
I haven't gotten the schematics, so I'm guessing that will have to be on your watch, if you're up for it. Good luck.
sit down. Have some menudo.
takes the edge off. I - should go.
where are the schematics?
eat first, schematics later.
where are they, Gael?
man of few words again?
what a pity.
is that my watch?
it was your watch until you gave it to me when you were drunk.
I consider it a reminder of your better half.
be at this address in an hour.
Garcia will take you into town.
a courier will hand you the schematics once the wire transfer is confirmed.
how will I know him?
Oh, don't worry, my friend.
he'll know you.
Where's my gold star?
it'll have to wait.
we don't have a bead on Chu.
and while Tony's analyzing the SIM card, your better half has a family issue to deal with.
is it meatloaf night already?
she waited all night at Tom's hotel.
obviously he never showed.
anything I should know about?
scrape on my left knee.
damn stroller nicked me going through security.
got it.
okay, should be ready to go.
I hope you get the details straight, Tony, because if Tom's life gets complicated, mine does, too.
don't worry, your bases are covered.
kids!
honey?
Hey, what's wrong?
are you okay?
I went to your hotel in Portland.
you never checked in. - What? You came to see me?
to surprise you. Where the hell were you?
I was in Seattle.
Greg moved the meeting at the last second.
honey, Greg moved the meeting at the last second.
you didn't even know till you were at the airport.
you called Mary... ...six or seven times.
you didn't get my messages?
no, and I've had my phone with me the whole time.
what?
this doesn't make sense.
phone records.
voice mail.
- Hey, babe, it's me.
where are you?
I'm still in Seattle.
no, you never-- There wasn't a message on my phone.
I flew there, I waited in your hotel all night.
I bought lingerie.
honey, I'm sorry you had to be alone there.
I am sorry that you had to think for a second that I was lying.
come on, you know I love you.
I love you, too.
you don't believe me.- I want to, but how
Oh, Mary, what do you think happened while I was gone?
I don't know.
you are always going on these last minute business meetings.
I don't know what you're doing. - What do I need to do to make you believe me?
you want to ticket stubs?
you want receipts? You want the names of everyone I met with?
okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, tommy. I'm sorry.
I believe you.
I--I just miss you.
okay.
I'm sorry, Tom. I made a mistake. - It's okay.
hey... It's okay.
I'm sorry I yelled.
get out.
there you are.
Yeah, I'm on my way to meet the client in 15 minutes at the conference.
I need you to fax over the paperwork before I get there.
Edward's surfaced.
the meet's in 15.
prepare the fund transfer.
got it. You underestimated Edward.
again.
you've been doing that a lot lately.
hold on, something's off. - What is it?
wire transfer into gael's account is being delayed because another transfer is being made at the same time for ten million.
another buyer?
I don't think so.
it's coming from an account from a known front for the FSB.
now why would the FSB make a bid on a technology they already possess?
they wouldn't.
but ten million is the bounty Uzi put on Edward's life.
yeah? - It's a trap.
get out of there.
way ahead of you.
get in.
you set me up. - I know. Get in.
get in! Come on!
all clear.
not that I'm complaining, but why the change of heart?
I checked on Bogota.
you were right about the sting.
good to know I can handle my liquor.
the schematics.
so, I assume the wire transfer went through?
no, no, no. This one's on me.
because of Bogota?
partly.
and partly because for the first time, in I don't know how long,
I asked my daughter what she wanted.
it felt good.
and it's gonna save me a fortune.
thanks to you, my friend.
I tell you what.
give me my watch back, and we'll call it even.
when tony was digging around the records on theresa Chu's simm card, he found this.
I hope this is important. Tom and Mary have a hot date planned.
it's a chinese intelligence encryption program.
they already got to Chu?
no, she's ministry.
her real name is Peng Lihua.
supposedly she was killed in action four years ago.
right about the time our boy started his e-mail love affair.
how close is she?
I plotted the tracer's route against international aviation records, and it looks like she's on a Malaysian airlines flight to Beijing.
it lands in 10 hours.
it would be a shame for her to get there before you do.
Hey, I'm just walking out the door. Where are you?
I'm stuck at work. Can we take a rain check?
I'm not even sure I'll be home tonight.
Oh, okay.
you know what? Hannah's not feeling well anyway, so.
all right then. Well, you should look after her.
you there?
Yeah.
I'll make it up to you, okay?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
got to go.
I love you.
Yeah, in Los Angeles.
can I have the number for a private investigator?
I can see you're upset. I'm sorry.
I just want to make sure you understand what you're doing here.
I want to know what my husband does when he says he's away on business.
you're sure?
you may not like what you find out.
I'm sure.
beijing China
you're a long way from the Vancouver airport.
we got the schematics and saved the company $6 million.
and when I say "we" I mean me.
let me be clear.
you did not save my life.
you told gael about a classified mi-5 operation that, thanks to you, went bust.
his showing appreciation for that by coming to the market did not,
I repeat, did not, alter the outcome.
still, I might have gotten you a little something to acknowledge you didn't completely screw up.
although the next time you think about giving away my watch
Hey, Ang? Did you see this?
I did.
it came this morning.
thank you.
so, it seems like you're still mad at me, which means we didn't make up.
but I got us a fridge, which seems like a nice gesture, I think.
it is.
and I'm not mad at you, Henry.
I know that you have a lot on your mind with work, and this was the last thing either of us wanted to deal with.
but you did, and I appreciate it.
this has got filtered ice.
I know, and all the crisper drawers have humidity controls.
Ooh. - Yeah.
completely unnecessary, and somehow it's made me that much more attracted to you.
so, now for the important business.
you daughter is upstairs getting ready for the bat mitzvah.
I've bought her a new dress.
you might want to make sure it's not pleather.
deal.
come in.
daddy.
you look great.
Really?
this dress is perfect.
the other one should never have been bought in the first place.
that's okay.
I really didn't like it anyway.
then why did you let me buy it?
you didn't ask my opinion.
honey...
we were shopping for you, not me.
so next time if I forget to ask what you want, just promise you will tell me, okay?
okay, daddy.
I love you, sweetie. - I love you, too.
dad?
Yeah, honey?
that man that we saw when we stopped before we went shopping.
what man?
I know I was supposed to stay down in the car, but I peeked and I saw him.
Ruthy, what did you see?
nothing, I promise.
he just--he scared me.
what happened to his face?
agent banks, this is Henry Spivey.
I want to talk.
good. That's good.
we don't do this on the phone though.
meet me at the railyard, 11th street and santa fe, in an hour.
fine.
you made the right decision, Henry.
spivey wants to talk. Yeah, the meeting's been set.
understood. He mentions Janus, it means Edward's broken and we take him out.
Hello, Henry.
I'm glad you reconsidered.
you have to guarantee me that my family will be taken care of.
you have my word.
you have to promise me that they will be safe.
I will make it my personal responsibility to see to their safety.
thank you.
So...who do you work for?
I work for AJ Sun.
and who does Edward Albright work for?
edward Albright works for an organization called Janus.
nothing personal, Henry.
Hello, Henry.
to journey beyond the reaches of our solar system to the closest star...
would mean traveling the distance of more than five trillion miles,
yet the dimensions of the cosmos are so unimaginably vast...
units of measurement become...
I've been kissed three times, No, four times,
no, three times, All of them were people I never saw again...
which I hope doesn't mean something,
one was this counselor at this YMCA camp,
except he already had a girlfriend, ...under all this pressure...
the inner core of the star now implodes violently...
producing an explosion of unparalleled intensity,
one was this usher at my mother's cousin's wedding two years ago,
the wedding was in Milwaukee,
we stayed over at a motor lodge with a heated pool,
it was a double ring ceremony,
he was staring at me all through the ceremony,
later...
I found out he only kissed me because he had lost a bet,
the third kiss is the hardest to describe,
it was this guy I met on the beach last summer,
it was Labor Day,
it was the day I swam out too far,
that was the most exciting one...
except it may not count as an actual kiss...
since I was kind of unconscious,
I've never had an actual boyfriend, I don't know if that's normal or not, - You know that girl Dana? - Dana Odinger?
Dana. Hey!
she has hair tails, and three little studs in each ear.
she used to wear her eyeliner pointy and now she wears it smudged.
and her feet are perfect, small with a really high arch.
so, what about her? - Nothing, she just annoys me.
her lips are so puffed out it's like she siliconed them.
Really? Do you think she did?
you think she siliconed her lips, really?
Angela, he's gone. You can talk like a normal person.
Oh, God.
you have to progress to the next phase. Think of Rickie and me.
how much more can we take?
I just don't want to look like I'm throwing myself at him.
excuse me, people throwing themselves at people...
is like the basis of civilization.
she has a point.
if Jordan Catalano is nearby, my entire body knows it,
like one of those dogs that point, I'll keep talking and stuff...
but my mind won't even know what I'm saying,
I keep wondering if there's a term for this,
okay, now before we cut our hearts open...
people, it's a pig heart.
students opposed to the practice of vivisection may do research...
at the library instead, but you must put this belief in writing.
now, to review, an experiment must test a what?
a hypothesis.
and a hypothesis consists of several... anybody?
several assumptions.
and true experimentation depends upon... guys?
precision, observation, and clear concise communication.
what?
I said, I'm leaving now, so...
I guess I don't rate a kiss anymore. - Wait, what?
nothing. It's just you don't kiss me goodbye in the mornings anymore.
Patty, we'll be seeing each other in forty minutes.
Yeah, I know. Just because we're working together now that's no reason to stop
I mean, this isn't the time to start anything.
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot, a kiss must result in intercourse.
well, it's a law in this state.
there can be no kissing for kissing's sake a kiss must lead somewhere.
where did they drill that into you? Was it shop class?
I can't believe it.
I swore I would never fight with you again this early in the morning.
this isn't a fight, it's goodbye.
what are the elements of a true experiment?
and what sort of activity is an experiment?
it's a purposeful activity, designed to solve a what?
a particular problem.
how much money did you lose?
none.
so, Catalano. So, Tino says you can get my girlfriend a fake ID.
so? So could Tino.
Oh yeah, see, he does me so many favors I feel like...
I'm wearing him thin.
kind of with that out of state look? Like from Georgia or something?
my girlfriend really needs one. Angela?
it's like an emergency. - Why doesn't she ask for herself?
that's a long story. She's... French!
she's from France.
get out of here.
seriously. And with certain words she'll like...
forget how to pronounce them, or something.
it's like a mental block type of thing.
that girl I see you with... - Angela. Chase.
is French?
she was born there, I mean she hasn't lived there in quite a while.
she's a US citizen and all.
what kind of ID?
okay, important. I need to see the hands of those handing in...
their extra credit experiments on Friday.
okay, Justin, Sonya.
michael are you and Sonya working together?
come here!
okay, so that's Jeremy...
Shane and... Brian?
what happened to your lab partner? - She almost fainted. So...
and your extra credit project is?
controlled release of energy. Construction and use of a volumeter.
is that something you worked on alone or with Angela?
with Angela.
okay, people? Your hearts must be clearly labeled...
before returning them to the cart.
please do not drip.
what?
like Angela really helped you with your volumeter?
she's planning to.
look I mean, why would I say it if it wasn't true?
why would you say she was fainting? Okay, what was that?
I mean, some of us actually work, you know?
we don't just expect extra credit because our lab partner is smart.
she takes advantage of you, and you totally let her.
I pity you.
Oh, my God...
Hey, I did it for you. It's a good thing.
it's a definite good thing. - Wait, you were there, too?
no, but she told me the whole thing.
I bet people can actually die of embarrassment...
I bet it's been medically proven.
worst case, you get an out of state ID, which you need anyway.
just wait.
tell me everything he said. - You will definitely thank me.
it's true... I mean from what she told me, which was everything.
in fact, you should be thanking me right now. - God, let's stop talking about this.
so, how did he act? Did he act bored, or...
he flopped on the floor, uncontrollably, okay?
Rickie had to hold down his tongue... - And I wasn't even there.
what I dread, is when people who know you...
in completely different ways end up in the same area.
thanks for leaving me a whole heart to clean up.
and you have to develop this combination you, on the spot,
so Chavatal, she thinks we're both working on my volumeter.
his what?
it's this experiment. There's like a mouse involved.
what's your name again?
so you think that's fair? I mean I do all the work and you just...
I never said I was doing it. - She's giving you credit, so...
look, I already executed the entire apparatus...
the apparatus...
so, I think the least you can do, is just help me work on it.
tomorrow night. Because...
he wants you to work on his apparatus.
just shut up, okay?
what would your parents say? - They are out of town, which is...
which has nothing to do... - She'll be there.
Rayanne! - What?
Rayanne! - What? This is perfect.
as what? - Excuse me, what is a volumeter?
as a place to bring Jordan Catalano.
are you crazy? Were you raised in a satanic cult?
she wishes.
jordan Catalano? At Brian Krakow's house?
it's like against nature or something.
so?
chase! Are you going to help me or not?
yes or no? - Oh God.
Yes.
the plan is... wait, what's the plan?
you are going to so love having a fake ID.
I collect them. I'm a victim. Okay, the plan.
you go to what's his name's to help him with his...
volume thing. - Right!
meanwhile, Rickie and I, and Jordan Catalano will procure you an ID.
which we will then bring back to what's his name's.
where you and Jordan Catalano will then be.
but in my humble opinion, he's Jordan Catalano.
he's not going to do any of this.
Sharon refuses to come in.
okay, what's the deal?
you tell me. All Sharon will say is that...
Angela's been acting distant...
so then she called her on it in the girls' room one day...
and they both cried.
ever since, they've kind of avoided each other and that's all I know.
that's a miniseries compared to what I know.
hey Cherski. So, by the way, Chase is coming over tomorrow night...
to, you know, compile data.
so? - So, she's coming over.
so, to help me.
so That obviously proves that-- - What?
that you were obviously wrong about the whole situation.
right. I was wrong Krakow. Just keep telling yourself that.
remember when we stopped speaking?
Yes.
because you told everybody I made out with Mitchell Moscarelli...
behind the duck pond.
you did make out with Mitchell Moscarelli.
but not behind the duck pond.
Thanks. I don't know, I probably just put this in my closet.
should I cut my hair short?
I can't take this. I feel sick.
look, I was there.
and I was practically there from hearing it so many times.
and he is definitely semi-interested.
so you think he... - I think...
part of him is partly interested in you. Definitely.
I mean, he's got other things on his mind.
but that's the part that's so unfair. I have nothing else on my mind.
how come I have to be the one sitting around analyzing him...
in microscopic detail...
and he gets to be the one with other things on his mind.
that is deep.
it's this working together. It's pushing us apart.
God, that sounds like a Redbook article.
listen, if you've got to cut it, cut it. You know?
but let's face it, men like long hair.
who cares what they like. But they supposedly like variety, don't they?
they like long hair, and they like for you to wear red.
Yes, but don't they supposedly like it if you show up looking different?
Oh, God. Shoot me will you?
look. Your Cinderella. I remember when your dad gave you this.
I was so jealous. I was 12. And you were 11.
and I wore my hair exactly like this.
look, they say if you want to put the romance back in your marriage
no, I hate that expression. Like romance is this thing...
you misplace like an earring.
and all that stuff they tell you to do.
put rose petals on his pillow. Oh, I will.
let me just empty this kitty litter I'll be right with you.
wear satin panties.
like my dry-cleaning bill isn't frightening enough.
force your husband into a car and don't tell him where you're going.
I do that every other weekend it's called visiting my parents.
didn't Jane Seymour write a book about that?
Yes. And now she's divorced.
but she's remarried. She's that medicine woman.
and is her hair long or short?
she's got a new show, new husband, and probably all new children.
listen, Andy and I have been doing this thing...
it's kind of embarrassing, but it's really fun.
and you get to be with other people. And it really puts you in the mood.
is it legal?
the only catch is that you have to wear heels.
ballroom dancing? - Camille says it's a lot of fun.
Camille thinks Velcro is fun.
velcro really is pretty amazing, don't you think?
Neil, pass the pasta.
what's the magic word? - Pasta.
no, that's the magic carbohydrate. What's the magic word?
Neil is my father's younger brother, He isn't married,
whenever he comes to dinner my parents give him all these leftovers...
to take home, like they don't have food where he lives,
I know that ballroom dancing doesn't sound like...
something we would normally do.
it sounds like something no one would normally do.
it does. It sounds made up. - That's exactly what I was thinking!
doesn't it?
it's completely made up. There's no such thing.
I'm thinking of getting my hair cut. Short.
no, Mom, don't. - We like your hair how it is.
mom, just because I changed my hair doesn't mean you should.
what do you think?
short, like Hillary Clinton?
forget it. You know, Hillary Clinton is a brilliant woman...
and people should stop judging her by her hair.
who's judging her? I think she looks great.
I mean, don't you think Hillary Clinton looks great?
I think She should wear more red.
it's over, me and Marla, there's still a connection, I mean...
we still see each other sometimes, and once in a while...
we still have sex.
sounds like my marriage. Just kidding.
I screwed up. I just can't... I don't... Oh boy...
I mean I envy what you have with Patty.
Patty and I have our problems. - Yeah. Sure you do...
you do?
well I mean, it's only normal that things can't always be...
it's just not realistic.
not that I'm not, you know, happy.
what, are you kidding me? You and Patty?
you're the happiest couple I know. No question.
I know.
honey, no. We've discussed this. It's a school night.
mom, I'll be right across the street.
I think we should try that ballroom dancing thing.
Really? You really want to because I don't want to make
I said I want to. - Well, great.
mom. Mom?
maybe Neil could stay with Danielle...
and Angela told Brian Krakow that she would help him...
with some kind of science experiment tomorrow night.
apparently there's a mouse involved.
can't they bring the mouse here?
I don't think she wants Danielle around from the look on her face.
I think she has a crush.
on Brian Krakow? - She could do a lot worse.
I like Brian don't you? - Until a few seconds ago.
mom, can I go? Mom.
mom, stop singing.
I know, I'm not allowed to sing, I'm not allowed to dance.
Amish mom. - Can I go to Brian's yes or no?
just be back by 9: 30.
so, wait, seriously, should I?
cut my hair. I mean, pretend I'm not your mom.
mom. I can't pretend that.
once again, an experiment can be termed successful if what?
if the experiment yields meaningful results,
the thought that I might be seeing Jordan Catalano in a few hours...
was like, impossible to comprehend,
like when they first tell you about infinity,
I couldn't believe how long it had been...
since I had been inside Brian Krakow's house,
considering how many hours I spent here when I was little,
it smelled exactly the same which was reassuring, and annoying,
sort of like Brian himself,
that mouse can breathe, right?
it's measuring heat and energy. If it couldn't breathe then...
this clamp is coming loose.
listen, Rayanne Graff and Rickie Vasquez might be coming over...
for a minute, just...
to bring me something.
I knew you wouldn't be much help.
Hi. I hope I'm not late. - No. No, you're...
that's our instructor, she just...
Hi!
so, what do you think?
it's short. - Yes, it is.
it shows your ears more.
Mr. and Mrs. Chase? It's show time.
so. Thanks. So...
so Angela's got the money... - Right. So...
wait here, we'll send her out. Oh, I almost forgot, Tino...
Yeah. Didn't he say that...
Yeah. See, I mentioned that you'd be dropping us and he said...
tell Catalano I'll meet him there, I got something I want to tell him.
about Frozen Embryos?
what's that? - Just this band we might form.
Yeah, I think that was-- - I think that was it.
slow, slow, quick, quick. Slow, slow, quick, quick.
okay. Your slows are too quick, your quicks are too slow. Okay?
poor mouse. I hate just being in an elevator.
Angela-- - Wait. I have to talk to you.
look, I know this is your house and all...
but could you leave for a second?
so you actually admit it's my house.
that's really... Because I was wondering...
no. She's not saying...
I'm not saying leave the house. Just leave the kitchen.
just come here for a second please?
I'm really sorry, this won't take long.
and back, back, back, slide together...
okay, Patty, let him steer you because he's the one going forward.
when do I get to go forward?
see, it is the man who goes forward most frequently.
tell me about it.
do you have any idea how hard it is to do this backwards?
believe me, they had their free introductory class once too.
listen, a lot of times couples think they're going to just...
automatically dance like that but it's not quite that simple.
okay? And one, back, good, let's go, one, two...
she's not saying that she
I'm not saying. See there's thinking about him, right?
which is what I do. All the time. Like this...
obsession. - Right. So?
so, it keeps me going or something.
like I need it just to get through the day.
it... It's just... - It's an obsession.
right. And, and if you make it real, it's not the same.
it's not, it's not yours anymore.
I don't know, maybe I'd rather have the fantasy than even him.
I completely understand this.
I totally and completely disagree.
you want Jordan Catalano in actuality because...
there is no because. You just want him.
only you're programmed to never admit it.
that does have the ring of truth.
okay. Here's your free evaluation, which is easy...
because you both sort of have the same problem...
which is rushing.
like, ahead of the music.
I would strongly recommend group classes.
you should be dancing with other people.
what? Why? I don't want to dance with anybody else, I mean, do you?
I thought the whole point here was to do something together.
maybe it helps. I mean maybe...
he won't admit it but he's dying to dance with other people.
Hey, this was your idea. I didn't want to dance with anybody!
okay. This isn't easy. There are many different parts of this...
that have to come together.
like, the rhythm. Not too fast, not too slow.
the confidence to make the steps your own.
lots of people, they try so hard, They can't hear the music,
then, they start to feel lost,
so they want to look down,
don't look down, It will throw you off balance...
and you'll lose your footing,
so, look straight ahead...
look right into your partner's eyes...
and remember to smile,
Hi.
so, I have the money. So, you have my ID, right?
Yes.
so, this is your car?
get in.
I can't go anywhere. I mean I should stay here.
it's a long story.
I didn't say go anywhere. - Okay.
all right, so what's it called again? A volvo...
a volumeter. - And what does it do again?
it measures pressure. - Yeah, but like, what?
air pressure? There are a lot of pressures.
Acupressure? Emotional Pressure?
like the mouse itself must be under pressure.
that would be cool for an experiment.
figure out what the mouse itself, like what goes through it's mind.
was it hard to get it in there? - Shut up!
just shut up.
it was just a joke. You should measure your own pressure.
so...
the mouse makes pressure, just by breathing?
Yes. - I can relate.
but why are you... I mean, what is the point?
it proves... It's a system that's been devised...
and there are certain scientific principles that...
it's for extra credit.
what's amazing is when you can feel your life going somewhere,
like your life just figured out how to get good,
like, that second,
it looks real.
why does-- Hey.
I'm s-- I'm sorry, I just... - No.
I was... I was talking.
no... whatever.
so how come
quit it!
I mean, you have to work up to that.
I don't open that wide at the dentist.
how old are you?
I don't believe this. What is your point?
fifteen. - You act younger.
first of all, you don't know me well enough to say how old I seem.
and second-- - You talk a lot.
I've said, like eight sentences to you in my entire life.
this whole day has been one long thing that makes no sense.
we both stopped talking, Part of his sleeve was touching my arm,
I don't know if he knew,
then everything started to seem perfect, for some reason,
the feel of his shirt against my elbow,
the fact that I still had an elbow, It was the perfect moment...
for him to kiss me, For him to anything me,
I got to go, so... later.
I could have killed him,
you're back so early? Angela is not even due home yet.
I think Danielle is asleep.
what did you do to your hair?
boy. Patty can be really touchy sometimes.
I didn't say that I didn't like it. Anyway, I don't know.
it's going to grow back in. Not in our lifetime...
I met this girl.
what? What? I'm not surprised.
how can you say that? - I don't know, I just...
I didn't mean to meet her.
I was doing some printing for her and we started...
you know...
we would get into these really long conversations the kind where...
you look up and you're surprised to see other people.
you're burning your butter.
one day, out of nowhere, she grabs my tie, and she says...
I hate you. I can't sleep because of you." Right?
she starts saying these unbelievable things...
no, she was holding on to your tie at this point
the point is, we haven't really done anything but talk.
but-- - You can't do this to me.
I'm MEANIf you and Patty get a divorce where
shut up! No one is getting a divorce.
where am I going to go, I mean like, on holidays.
I'm supposed to meet her at this motel. Tomorrow afternoon.
God. That's such a cliche. - I know. I know.
cliches happen.
talk me out of it. - Don't do it.
well, don't. Look at you.
I mean you haven't even done anything really wrong yet...
and already you're acting weird.
you went dancing.
I know.
Hey! Where's... I mean is Tino here?
that's... I mean, that's Angela's.
shouldn't it prove that she's 21?
so?
so according to this she was born yesterday.
why are you here?
I live here.
is she really from France?
never mind. Just make sure she gets that, okay?
sure.
can I say something? I don't think that this was such a terrible evening.
I never said it was. - But you're sitting there thinking
you don't know what I'm thinking-- - Oh, shut up!
how could you say that about my hair?
what did I say? - That it shows my ears more.
it does. - Yeah, but what kind of a thing...
is that to say? Do you think I felt like tangoing with you after that?
I didn't know what to say.
all of a sudden there's all this all this pressure to...
you know, complement you.
and lead, and
there's something wrong here. Am I right?
we're drifting apart from seeing each other too much.
we've become like furniture to each other or something.
have we become incompatible because we are terrible...
we are terrible dancers.
so what?
how can we have been together for so long...
and not be able to dance together?
Because! Because we have been together for so long!
dance with me.
but we don't know how.
we know how.
I'm not going to take the extra credit.
whatever.
you forgot this.
so why did our generation always dance so far apart?
too rebellious, I guess.
I mean when we danced close, there were no...
right, no steps or anything.
we just made it all up.
never took the time to learn the real steps.
I thought I heard someone.
so, your mom and I went dancing.
it's hard. It's harder than it sounds.
dad, I don't feel like talking. No offense.
I don't feel like talking. Certainly not to you.
you want me to warm up that spaghetti?
I have to say that when my father warms something up...
it tastes better than when anyone else does,
so how did your experiment go with Brian?
he did most of it.
so is this like, a date?
dad! It's...
they're not...
people just hang out.
they're not, it's not dates. Just people.
together. In a bunch.
so, was there someone else there you like?
it's so strange how parents can out of nowhere turn psychic,
it's unnerving,
it's okay to like someone, but I mean...
boys your age, can sometimes
dad, I know.
can sometimes what?
can sometimes not know how to be what you want them to be.
my point is that...
it's really hard to figure out how to be a man.
practically every man I know is still working on it.
so that's what we're doing, we're eating.
really shows my ears more?
it's time for bed you two.
you two go ahead, I'll clean up.
it's me, listen.
I can't do this. I know I acted like I could but I can't.
you must think that I'm an idiot and maybe I am but...
it's not going to happen.
because it can't. Because there are so many reasons why.
look, I can't really talk, except... No this is not you.
this is not your fault. It's me. I'm sorry.
I just can't. I'm sorry.
you are going to have a hard time getting up in the morning.
daddy's home!
Hey! Hi, honey! - Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
Hello? Anybody here?
anybody? I'm home!
you never said he had stubble. - He doesn't, usually.
so, I'm going. I'm catching the 3rd Street bus. Are you coming?
UMM??? No, Amber said she'd pick me up later. Is that okay?
sure. - Okay.
Bye.
Hi. - Hi.
Oh, Look, Rickie and your dad are bonding.
come on.
Bye.
Bye.
they're exchanging fashion tips. - Rayanne!
Hey!
so, is this the famous Rayanne?
this is the famous Angela's Dad.
dad, your whiskers scratch.
Oh, sorry. - I did it!
good. All right. Okay, you're in the zone now.
so, The next batch will be great.
do you want something else? Honey. You want me? - I'll have fritters.
I can make you something else. - I am so hungry.
do you ever get hypnotized by food?
are you kidding me? Hypnotized By Food could be my Indian name.
honey, do you want to flip one? - Rayanne can do it.
I got to call my brother.
I can't believe I am cooking something not in a pouch.
I'll still eat it.
that's a weird sounding beep, Neil.
hey listen, you know that guy, Earl, that I did the rush for?
he laid two tickets on me to the Dead concert Thursday night.
Oh my God. - Save the date, call me back. Bye.
you're into the Dead? This explains so much.
Oh, yeah?
the undercurrent of connections between Angela and me.
you see, my mom's going to the Dead show Thursday night?
she's a former Wharf Rat.
the Grateful Dead is this thing that we totally share.
before she had me, she lived in a bus for months...
with a girl named Pop Tart.
well, Angela is not really into the Dead, am I right?
you will be. After you hear our bootleg stuff.
my mom got this tape from this guy, maybe you know him...
Mike in Boulder, Colorado? - No.
palo Alto, 1971. They closed with "Cosmic Charlie."
right, I was there. - Get out of here!
nice save. Sweetheart, may I speak to you for a moment?
sure.
when you're not sure you trust a person anymore...
say a person you really trusted, say your father, you start wishing...
they'd do something really wrong so you could be right about them,
OK, Bear with me, I'm upset.
Oh, look. I know how you feel about her, but she's actually not a bad kid.
who, that Rayanne person? Oh, please. She's the least of my problems.
good, because Angela wants her to stay to dinner.
fine. I don't care. Whatever.
listen, we got a really upsetting letter today.
Oh, man.
the IRS. It's not the "A" word-- I cannot believe we're being audited.
that Wood & Jones Printing is.
your federal income tax return has been selected for examination.
this is really scary. They must get Stephen King to write these.
I called Dad. He's going to come over so we can figure out what we want...
you told your dad about this, before you told me?
honey, look at the date, 1992.
that's the year he got sick, the year I took over.
he was not pleased. - Yes, he's been caught red-handed.
graham, he was flat on his back in a hospital, the spring of 1992.
if anyone is to blame, it's me. I'm the one who prepared the return.
because he was too cheap to hire an accountant.
promise me, we will handle this in our own way.
handle what? - Nothing.
well, We're being audited.
not us, exactly, Wood & Jones Printing. - Which, of course, is us.
Why? Did you lie about something? - Why are you looking at me?
nobody lied. It can happen to anyone. They pick people at random.
but, I'll lay even money that Grandpa lied.
so? Can Rayanne still stay for dinner? - Yes, yes.
just checking.
did you see that? You hear that? "Just checking.
did you notice that tone that she takes with me now?
I didn't notice anything.
something's not right between her and me.
she acts so all distant with this sort of silent contempt.
graham, she adores you.
and I've got dibs on her silent contempt, okay?
Oh man, this is the hardest homework I've ever seen.
look at this.
I like when you don't shave, Daddy. - You do?
I like how it feels.
I can't concentrate in here.
Finally!
I found a copy of the return.
you got a rain gutter out there about to fall off.
this just in.
hit someone on the head, and you'll have a lawsuit on your hands.
we know, Dad. - Hi, Grandpa!
Hello, cookie. Okay, that's enough.
the place is lit up like a Christmas tree. You know that?
every light in the house is blazing.
trying to support the electric company single-handed?
dad, would you like some fruit or... -- What have you got there?
well??? This is a copy of the 1992 return.
ran my own business for thirty years. Never got audited.
dad, they pick people at random.
yes? Never picked me at random.
well, anyway, they do.
send a girl to do a man's job. -What did you say, Dad?
never mind. It's not worth repeating.
well, so they do say that when a small business like us takes a noticeably large deduction.
that's hard to justify..
who would do that?
Oh, Dad. Look here, the car. So you took off 87%.
it was a business car.
I know. But, that's the kind of deduction that...
you have to back up, with a log or...
Hey, There's my girl. -Daddy?
hi you, honey bunch! - Hi, Grandpa.
Oh, this is good.
you don't jump on me, like your sister, do you?
you got big.
you're a good kid, okay, just give me the Walkman, please?
I don't have a Walkman. I don't? - I'll give it back after school...
catalano, give her the stupid Walkman!
God, people are so rude.
so, not to shock you, but your dad is attractive.
Oh, I'm sure.
not that I'd attack him or anything...
but I wouldn't leave me alone with him either.
Oh, so when I was leaving, he was there, and I was, like...
" well, hi," and he was "Well, hi," and I was...
"well, bye," and he was "Well, bye."
it's not just physical. He's nice. You just have a really nice dad.
he's really nice.
when someone compliments your parents, there's nothing to say,
it's like a stun gun to your brain,
Plus, his stubble is the perfect length.
he doesn't have a stubble! He ran out of disposable razors that morning.
he was all disturbed about it. - In-Touch-With-His-Emotions Dad.
shut up!
ignore Angela, she can't help herself.
she's a product of a two-parent household.
I know, my Mom's been on the phone forever. We're getting audited.
I talked to Neil, he said...
we're crazy to do this without an accountant.
you're right. We shouldn't go into a thing like this unprepared...
but I know him, Graham. He'll never agree to
honey, I don't know what kind of trouble your dad's gotten us into...
but if they found something, we got to pay up, you know?
Where's Angela?
locked in her room with that Rayanne person, why?
I was just wondering. She hasn't said two words to me all week.
join the club. I almost forgot, we have a time.
are you listening?
to meet with the IRS lady, this Thursday, 4 o'clock.
that will be easy to remember. It's the same day as the concert.
what? - I never mentioned...
that Earl gave me two free tickets to the Dead concert.
you're kidding. - Honey, come on. It's the Dead!
Graham. - Honey!
please, please tell me that you are not going to top off our audit with a rock concert.
please, Graham.
so, you don't want me to go?
it's-- - Timber!
Vallone! I'll get Rayanne.
Hi, honey bunch. Rayanne, your mom's here.
I just got to find my sock because it's Rickie's.
so, which day is your mom going to see the Dead?
Thursday. Her and her honey.
she'd never let him hit Pittsburgh and not make it.
Ah, yes!
so, would you two like to go with them? To see the Dead?
Oh my God, Angela! But wait, you really want to go.
no, I got work to do, and anyway, I'm too old for that stuff.
so, what do you think? Would you like that?
sure. - Thank you!
I mean, thank you. Night, Ang! Night!
good night.
I know you're not wild about the Dead like Rayanne is, but
no, it's fine.
so, where are the tickets?
Oh, here.
I found all those receipts I forgot I had...
also a dirty book, that little pearl earring I was so upset about...
birthday card I never sent to my mother.
what book?
I want that back.
I've decided to skip the concert.
thank goodness.
I gave the tickets to Angela and Rayanne.
what? - Seriously?
Oh, yeah, it'll be fine. It turns out that Rayanne's mother is going.
of course, Rayanne's mother is going, and Heidi Fleiss is probably...
meeting her there, but that doesn't mean that Angela should go.
Patty, listen
and, to top it all off, it's a school night!
I mean, could you have had a more completely terrible idea?
I'll get the tickets back. I didn't think it through.
I was... Are you still awake?
just my brain.
I'm so ashamed. I feel like I've been bad.
the government is going to ground me.
angela is really acting weird toward me, you know?
you know, I think I'm going to have to ask my dad to butt out of this.
it's like she's holding something against me, or something.
but how can I do that, how can I question his judgment?
he built this business out of nothing. He's this rare individual.
Patty, You are ten times smarter than your dad is about business.
turn that off. I can't watch that guy. I miss Johnny.
I know.
I felt for Johnny, married to all those JoAnne's.
I think of him all alone on some God-forsaken Malibu beach...
no guests. God, I miss him.
look, I'll call him tomorrow, and I'll take him to lunch.
at that new place, with the fountain, that does all the non-fat cooking?
mom's been wanting me to take him there.
that's a great idea. - Yeah.
and it will be on my turf and my terms...
and I will wait for the right moment and I'll say...
chili fries?
come on, taste one. When's the last time you had a chili fry?
I couldn't say.
probably tastes a whole lot better than that place you suggested.
with the no-fat, no-cholesterol, no-flavor, no thank you.
dessert? - None for me.
bring her a piece of that banana cream pie.
dad, I don't want any pie. - I may have a little bite.
you are not supposed to have any sugar. - It's banana, it's all natural.
dad, about the audit-- UMM...I THINK???
Oh, almost forgot. My driving log.
you kept a driving log? - You see it there, don't you?
banana cream pie.
dad, not that you did, but they can tell
Patricia, perfectly legal.
reconstruction of what happened.
best of my ability? I spoke to her.
to the IRS agent?
dad, we agreed
she has no objection to us doing this without an accountant.
of course not, she's probably thrilled.
they want to trip you up. They have got all sorts of techniques
Hey, I can handle the IRS. What I can't handle is my own daughter telling me what to do.
you don't know what you're missing.
excuse me. Whose classroom is this?
Mayhew's. - And where is Ms. Mayhew?
she is out of here. She couldn't deal.
aren't you guidance? - Yes.
we need guidance, Ms. Krzyzanowski.
okay, one at a time. Yes, girl with the red hair.
it's Ms. Mayhew's class, but I think she quit.
who has been teaching this class? - Mr. Rinaldi.
Mr. Rinaldi is the Spanish teacher. This is English.
what did Mr. Rinaldi do the last time he was here?
he showed a movie. - What movie?
alive. - Where is Mr. Rinaldi now?
Hey, Catalano! - Jordan.
Mr. Catalano! Join us.
okay, I'm going to pair you off...
and you are going to write three sentences on the movie "Alive..."
and you are going to trade papers and diagram those sentences.
and, I'm going to sit here and watch because my life is so empty.
okay, you and you, you and you...
you and the boy in the blue and...
you, in the pink shirt, you and you.
I couldn't believe that...
jordan Catalano was actually trying to diagram my sentences,
his sentences were really short,
tickets. For the Grateful Dead concert.
not that I like the Grateful Dead that much, but...
you know how sometimes the last sentence you said...
like echoes in your brain, and it just keeps sounding stupider?
and you have to say something else, just to make it stop?
Oh, I just remembered. I owe you thirty dollars.
for the I.D.? I don't have it on me, but I...
scalp your Dead tickets. - Really?
I don't know anyone who would buy them, do you?
you scalped our Dead tickets? - Rayanne.
you want me to talk to him? Maybe he hasn't sold them yet.
you're always saying we should think of ways to make money.
you want me talk to him? Because I'm willing to do it.
what are you talking about? Why are you talking about money?
we had Grateful Dead tickets.
people don't sell Grateful Dead tickets.
people give people Grateful Dead tickets.
I'm sorry. I just, I didn't think it was
your dad gave those tickets to both of us, including me.
I got to go. I got to go to Home Ec.
Oh my God.
she must really be upset. Why did you do it?
I mean, to have a reason to talk to Jordan?
not completely. - Then why?
I don't know.
dad, the meeting should be at the IRS office.
Yeah, but you don't know that she has an appointment with a chiropractor in this neighborhood.
she may have just told you that so she can get a good look at our-- What?
okay. Yes, say good night to Mom.
I'm so scared.
it's okay.
prison is not that bad, and I'll wait for you.
now he's got that agent coming here.
it's exactly what all the books say never to do.
I can't get him to listen. - Patty, listen...
you order people around all day long, people like me.
lunch was a disaster. He forced me to order pie.
and I actually ate it. I mean, what is wrong with me?
why do I become an eight year old around him?
so my rotten day is like foreplay?
I like it when you're... when you actually need me.
of course I need you.
did you talk to Angela about the concert?
I will, I promise.
what are you doing? - Get out of here!
I didn't know what I was looking for, Some kind of proof,
something that would make it make sense for me to hate him,
I lost part of my homework.
did you find it? - No.
ms. Mandeville. - Mrs. Chase.
that was my grandmother's.
she was completely dotty, of course. It's practically worthless.
keeps good time, though.
well, then it's not worthless.
you see, I was the one who actually prepared the return.
ms. Mandeville, I don't know if your records indicate this but...
I am a veteran.
so
I just didn't want to conceal anything, that's all.
I would also like to add that...
during the fiscal year in question, I was felled by a near-fatal heart attack
and was later found to be sick with diabetes.
well, you look just fine now.
well, I just don't think I should be penalized for bouncing back like I did.
why are you telling me this? Mr.? - No reason.
we've covered a lot of ground. Thank you. This was very helpful.
you can keep it if you like. - That won't be necessary.
Oh God, I forgot to talk to Angela about the concert.
anyway, it's obvious we'll be seeing a lot more of each other.
promise me you'll keep that in mind, Mr. Wood.
you won't go gallivanting off on some Caribbean vacation.
what?
I have been to the Caribbean exactly once. In 1956.
you're telling me you don't take lavish vacations?
cause I got the distinct impression that you...
Lavish?
my wife won't fly. She gets seasick. I've never been to Europe!
but you told me yourself that you do take a lot of time off.
we have to get away. But those are motoring trips.
we've always taken those. Like into the mountains.
sounds fun. What car do you use?
the wagon. I mean, either car. The compact usually.
OK. Here is what we're going to do. -Look. This has nothing to do with you.
we are going to pay all the taxes that we owe.
pay what? What did you say? - Chuck, come on.
daddy, please, just-- - Just what?
just let you sell me down the river?
daddy, I'm trying to help you here. - Help me? I don't need your help!
do we have an agreement? - We absolutely have an agreement.
agreement? Who the hell are you to make an agreement?
Hey! - Daddy, please.
Chuck, come on.
do what you want. I don't give a damn.
thank you. You have been very patient.
I'm sorry that
Angela! I have to-- - Dad, I can't talk right now.
I'm just sorry you had to witness that business between me and my father.
small potatoes compared to what I've seen.
we got a problem.
it's my mistake, I should have talked to your mother first.
the thing is, I can't allow you to go to that concert tonight.
what? The thing is your mother is just not comfortable with it.
so, I'm sorry. You'd better give the tickets back.
why do you need the tickets?
why do you need them, if you're not going?
just give them back.
Rayanne has them. And she's going to be here any second.
look, I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry!
I mean she's counting on me to come and I'm not going to do this to her.
Angela, look, let me call Rayanne.
I will explain it to her. - It was your idea!
I made a mistake. I'm not perfect.
Oh, believe me. That's become really clear.
there she is.
what the hell is going on? - Is she getting into Rayanne's car?
she's gone.
I cannot believe that you let this go this long.
Patty, I forgot, all right? - Come on? Why don't you just admit it?
you want her to go to this stupid concert!
all right! I admit it, okay?
look, I saw the Grateful Dead when I was fifteen years old.
it was one of the eight best nights of my life.
it's something I wanted to give her.
Oh? Fine. Leave. Just like he does. - You leave my father out of this.
what? What did you say? - It's not worth repeating.
and Brian, make sure the lid is on tight,
Hi.
it wasn't locked. And I can't go home right now...
and there's nowhere else to go, and it's so freezing.
are you meeting someone in here?
that's so unfunny.
what about my room? - What about your parents?
they won't even notice. They're balancing their joint checking.
mine are getting audited.
mine are probably getting a citation for best penmanship on a tax return, or something.
can I just stay here, just for a while?
why you can't go home?
my dad thinks I'm at a Grateful Dead concert...
and he'd be really upset if he knew I wasn't.
well.
your dad is so different from my dad.
look, it's my car. I think I have a right to know.
does this involve Jordan Catalano?
Angela, wait!
did you ever think that I could do something that does not involve you?
I mean that I may not be sitting around if you decide at that moment that you need my car?
so what were you doing? - Nothing!
you want my sweater?
okay.
try not to sweat into it.
why do you say things like that? - Why do you have to
Brian there's another bag of carriage. - I know!
no.
what's really horrible is being a witness while someone's parents orders them around,
it ruins the conversation, Brian?
so, wait, what were you saying? - Nothing. Just...
you shouldn't act one way towards a person when you need something, and then...
Dani, juice? - Not the pulp kind.
Oh, right. - I'll take some.
you left your Scottish sweater in my car, honey bunch.
Thanks, I was searching.
Angela, orange juice doesn't grow on trees.
it sort of does.
did you see how he's being?
don't call your father "he."
mom, he didn't want me to go to the concert, so fine, I didn't go.
but you let him think you were going...
and you sold tickets you had no business selling...
and you were less than forthright, to say the least.
why can't he just say that, instead of acting like I don't exist.
dad not even wanting to look at me is, like, the worst feeling.
I know.
Rayanne! - It was so beyond.
Rickie. - Oh my God.
finally, I've been looking everywhere for you guys.
anyway, so I'll see you at lunch.
I can't believe she's this mad. - I know.
but I can see it from your side, but I also see it from her side...
and from my own side.
but, I don't really have a side. Anyway, why did you do it?
I mean, were you mad at your dad?
what? Who said that?
well, With my dad, who's technically my uncle, but he raised me...
I mean, if he gives me something, and I'm mad at him, I can't open it.
but, that's different, because I'm somewhat afraid of my dad.
I mean, in the past, my dad has broken down my door.
my dad always knocks.
I had a feeling.
Rayanne, I feel terrible, okay?
and I have to go to Health in a few minutes.
Why?
why do I feel terrible?
Yeah.
because of what I did.
you didn't get to go to the concert.
no, I did. It was great. They played "Stagger Lee."
amber and Rusty took me, and Rusty ran into this guy he knew from Vietnam who was in a wheelchair.
he had an extra ticket. He had a sexy upper body, too.
making you feel bad is too easy, takes all the fun out of it.
look, your dad probably gives you stuff all the time...
so it's no big deal to you.
but to me...
the fact that he did that...
I guess that I'm envious like the green-eyed monster.
you don't know everything about my dad.
remember the night we couldn't get into Let's Bolt?
I saw him around the corner from our house...
and he was talking to this girl, like in her twenties.
so?
I'm lucky, my dad's had eight different girlfriends...
since he left, so I'm used to it.
but Angela...
whatever your dad may be doing with whatever girl...
and you don't even know if he is...
he's still the type of dad that would lay two Dead tickets on you.
out of nowhere.
that's what matters.
daddy? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
Patricia, you want to give me another heart attack?
what are you doing working so late? What's all this?
that's my master plan, Dad.
I want Wood & Jones Printers to move into the world of high speed copiers.
did you read it? What do you think?
well, it's an awful lot of money to spend in one fell swoop.
you know, that's exactly what I thought Dad, and then it came to me.
lease it. I mean, that way it'd only cost about eight grand a month.
I know, that's not peanuts, but...
Oh? Dad, it looks like offset.
people won't have to go to an offset printer.
they can come to us, we can keep more stuff in house.
well, I see you've got it all figured out.
you know, I could work sixteen hours a day and it wouldn't be enough.
you know how late I work.
I know you came here to make up with me.
me? I'm still waiting for an apology.
you'll be waiting a while.
dad, I have opinions.
I have to have them and stick to them.
make decisions. I have to. You asked me to when you asked me
I didn't ask you to bankrupt-- - No, Dad, you have to hear this!
when you asked me to take over, when you asked me to run this business...
maybe you didn't know, what you were asking, God knows I didn't...
and sometimes I miss how it used to be when I never questioned you.
but I've turned some sort of corner with this and I can't go back.
Yeah, well, that's your... that's your own business.
so why does there have to be this distance between us?
well. That's not my doing.
all right, now.
it's all right.
careful, I didn't shave today.
I don't have to do. That's the good thing about being retired. - I don't care.
when you were a little girl...
I'd go to give you a kiss good night...
but if I hadn't shaved, you pushed me away.
said my whiskers were too rough.
they were then.
that's what it is to raise a girl. Walking on egg shells half the time.
are you hungry?
come on, I'll buy you a piece of pie.
I thought you were asleep hours ago.
so, it seems that the breakup of the Beatles hadless to do with Yoko Ono, and more to do with the fact that...
paul wanted Linda's father to be their new business manager.
why do you think people give her such a hard time?
just because she can't sing?
I've worked so hard to please him, you know?
he doesn't realize...
what this all costs me.
he has never really known what I'm worth.
you know, sometimes I think...
that I partly married you because...
I knew... - Knew what?
that you'd be a really good father.
a different kind of father. You are.
Graham? Listen to me.
I don't want to lose her.
but you have to, just for a little while.
you have to let her push you away and not punish her for it.
all she's doing is pushing you off your pedestal...
and she's right to do that, she has to do it.
she's right on schedule.
she's not a thousand years late, like I am.
so, what do I do?
stand your ground.
you let her know that no matter how hard she pushes you away...
you'll still be there.
I love you.
I love you, too...
so much.
Hey! Hey! Hey, you want to give me a hand with this?
want to give me a hand?
for a second! Give me a hand!
this! Want to? Come over here! For a second. Give me a hand!
gee, thanks. I'd like to help you sir...
but I'm too busy picturing your daughter naked.
take that out to your father.
mom said I should bring this to you. - Just put it down there.
give me a hand with this. - Now?
Yeah, now. Come up here and, hold this in place, please.
hey? You want to use this thing, work out a little of that pent up anger?
you're the one that's angry.
so, tell me, what did you get for the tickets?
all together $120, but I owed this guy thirty dollars.
Really? And why is that?
dad, I can't get into it. It's too stupid and complicated.
so that leaves ninety dollars profit.
you'd better declare that as income.
declare it to who? - To me. You get my point?
so Rayanne said the concert was really good.
can I turn this off?
what do you like listening to these days?
I don't know.
smashing Pumpkins, Rage Against the Machine, Porno for Pyros
Oh yeah, I love their Christmas album.
stone Temple Pilots, I like Billie Holliday.
wait, you like Billie Holliday? - Yeah.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
if I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
newscaster: Before tonight's murder, there has been no clue as to who this killer might be.
but now the Riverton Ripper and the knife he uses have been caught by a high- definition security camera.
Sarah: Any day, now.
newscaster: Police say that the killer is a Caucasian male in his mid- to- late 30s.
it's too dark to see his face but the quality of the image has allowed forensic technicians to zoom in and enhance it enough to make out the word " Vengeance " etched on the blade of the Ripper's weapon.
no one was in the area at the time...
Sarah: That's beautiful, Abel.
and Leah's going to love that house.
shameless distraction device.
come to bed. The news is too scary for me to watch alone.
okay, sarah, l'll be up soon.
newscaster: we consulted local psychiatrist
Dr. william Blake.
Oh, shit!
newscaster: Here's what he had to say.
Dr. BLAKE: The identity of a killer of this sort may well not even be known to himself.
he could be anywhere and anyone leading a normal life, so far as he knows, and never dream for an instant that, every so often, he turns into a monster.
abel: What is this?
newscaster: Twenty-one-year-old Penny Anderson, a graduate student at Boston University... WOMAN: somebody! NEWsCAsTER: ...studying for a Ph. D. in psychology.
woman: Help me!
woman: Help me!
No!
dear God, tell me this is a dream.
abel: what's with the knife, Abel? what's with the blood?
it's really crazy stuff.
lt's not my knife, James!
l don't know what's with it.
l think someone has broken in.
no one has broken in. Come on, Penny.
female VOlCE: Please, Abel.
Blake said it could happen.
a one in a million chance, he said.
what if it did?
he said to call him, 24/7.
abel, listen. Call him now.
you've got to call Dr. Blake. Please put down the knife.
call the doctor.
female VOlCE: God will help you.
call Dr. Blake, and l kill your family.
sorry, sorry, l Just need a hug.
that knife is so scary, you know?
what knife?
Sarah: The Ripper's. They've got it on tape.
RlPPER: Don't do something stupid, Abel.
here's the deal.
just look the other way when I kill and your family stays alive.
turn me in, and you'll live alone in a house of blood.
Hello?
abel, this is Dr. Blake.
is everything okay?
no, no, no. Everything is not okay.
l found something.
what did you find?
a knife. Under my bench.
and not Just any knife.
the one on TV. The Ripper's knife.
I swear before God, Dr. Blake, I didn't know.
but the second that l went to call you there was somebody, and he said don't call you, or else...
Dr. BLAKE: Or else?
what?
or else he would kill sarah. And Leah. And the others, too.
abel, l'll be there in 10 minutes. l want you to tell sarah to take Leah, and drive to her sister's.
l haven't told her about this part of my life.
but you swore to me you would.
that's part of the agreement.
just get here before it's too late!
Dr. BLAKE: Abel, have sarah drive to May's house, with Leah.
may is working nights and sarah is sound asleep.
l can't Just wake her up. DR. BLAKE: You have to!
Abel?
you there?
Abel?
abel: No! No!
Dr. BLAKE: What the hell are you looking at? Break the door down.
abel: l won't let you do this! l won't!
Dr. BLAKE: Open the door. Abel!
abel: l won't...
Dr. BLAKE: Abel!
PATERsON: Police, open up!
BOBBY: Mr. Plenkov, open up.
Dr. BLAKE: Abel, open the door!
BOBBY: Plenkov! Open up!
PATERsON: Kick it in, Bobby.
Dr. BLAKE: Get up those stairs now!
PATERsON: Which room? On the right?
Mr. Plenkov! Mr. Plenkov!
Freeze!
shit!
Bobby, check him! Check him!
Hey, sweetie. Hey, sweetie, come here.
come here. What's your name? BOBBY: No pulse, Frank.
what's your name, huh?
BOBBY: l'll check the woman. No, no, no, no, look at me.
you're okay, all right? You're okay.
get away from me.
Bobby. Yeah?
get her downstairs.
BOBBY: Hey, sweetheart, here we go.
l got you. You're going to be fine.
PATERsON: Get in here.

PATERsON: He's dead.
so is Elvis. You never know.
you have an epi? We got it.
JEANNE: The mother is dead, too. Way dead.
you missed the kid, you fuck.
l'll get them all next time.
son of a bitch!
GUs: Epinephrine kicks ass! Hey! Hey!
JEANNE: Let's get the gurney, Gus.
abel, l'll get you to a hospital. Abel?
you piece of shit.
he's not a monster.
what do you call him, then?
l call him mentally ill.
thank you for stopping me.
Abel.
forgive me.
he's talking to you.
please!
would it hurt you to be human?
just once?
we'll let God sort it out.
thank you.
no, Abel!
abel, talk to me.
Abel's not here.
this is for you, you cunt!
that's for shut the fuck up.
how's Mrs. King doing?
baby is two months premature.
Dr. Carrie says he's blind, too.
seven births in one hour, all premature.
what's going on here? Anarchy!
may: What else you got?
we got a cop, Frank Paterson, who took two in the vest.
And?
and we got a perp. Go on.
mid- 30s, white male, under constraint and critical.
took multiple gunshots and stab wounds.
eeg flat.
Oh, and are you ready for this?
we think he's the Ripper.
what? Family guy.
killed the wife, tried to kill his kid.
you got a name?
Plenkov. Abel Plenkov.
GUs: May, you copy?
may?
he said he'd get them all next time.
what do you think he meant?
maybe he was talking about his other personalities.
my family is from Haiti.
and down there they don't say that someone like him has multiple personalities.
what do they say he has? Multiple souls.
what's the difference?
personalities die when the patient dies.
souls live on.
lt's all Just superstition, l suppose.
could you hand me my Jacket, please?
lt's cold as hell in here.
Thanks.
ls this your evidence bag?
get that fucker under control!
shit!
Frank!

GUs: Let me see!
PATERsON: Shit. Fix that!
PATERsON: Call for backup!
l got Plenkov!
PATERsON: Fuck!
crowd: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12!
BRANDON: The lights out!
BRANDON: Midnight!
all right! This is it!
let the day begin!
as you all know,
Ripper Day marks two things.
one of them bad, one of them good.
the good part is, it's the birthday of seven of us here born 16 years ago tonight.
Jerome King.
Hey, Jerome.
Alex Dunkelman.
Jay Chan, with a new Ripper puppet tonight.
yeah
bug Hellerman...
Hellerman?
Alex: lt's about time!
BRANDON: Better late than never, l suppose.
where you been? sleeping.
lt's okay, Bug takes a little longer because he's a little slower, l guess.
moving on to Penelope Bryte over there, by the ambulance, who, incidentally, knows God.
they speak daily.
and to the beautiful and gorgeous Brittany Cunningham.
and last, but, of course, not least...
all: Brandon O'Neil!
Yes, sir!
thank you, thank you, thank you very much. Pleasure.
now, it's time for the bad part, people.
we of the Riverton seven have had to share our birthday with a monster, the serial killer Abel Plenkov, who died at midnight the day we were born.
lt's the Ripper. CROWD: Ooh.
legend has it that we, the Riverton seven, are the mirrors of Abel Plenkov's personalities.
the ones that turned the Ripper in.
and that the Ripper still wants revenge.
so Abel Plenkov is dead, but his ghost isn't.
no, it lurks underneath the old railroad bridge.
you've seen it.
lt sleeps in the river.
lt roams the darkest corners of the woods
just waiting for the next Ripper Day to come around.
because, on that day, our birthday, tonight, the devil has told him that he can take his revenge.
but he can only come out of the river at this spot.
and every year, since we have been able, one of us Riverton seven has volunteered to drive him back into the river where he belongs.
and tonight is no exception.
and l, personally, have chosen to volunteer... GlRL 1: Brandon? GlRL 2: No!
...to volunteer Bug Hellerman, that is.
BRANDON: lt's your turn, Bug.
all the rest of us have done it.
we will now summon the Ripper from the river.
lf he appears yet again, then Bug must slay him, or we'll all die.
can you do it, Bug?
save us! Let's call him up!
lf you can hear me, Ripper, make yourself known!
all: Make yourself known!
make yourself known!
make yourself known!
make yourself known!
make yourself known!
BRANDON: Fear ye, Ripper!
all: Fear ye the Ripper!
shut up! JEROME: What did l do?
Alex: Bug is freaking out.
BRANDON: Fear ye the Ripper!
all: Fear ye the Ripper!
Oh, my God. What is that?
JEROME: lt's coming from the woods.
BRANDON: Whoa! Nice, Jay.
JAY: Damn right.
come on, Bug, it's Just a puppet. Knock it over.
all: Fear ye the Ripper!
JEROME: Come on, you can take him, Bug!
get in there, you pussy!
look at how scared he is!
Alex: Push him over. BRANDON: Down on your knees, Bug!
JEROME: Slay that beastie, Bug.
BRANDON: Damn, that is a big mother. JEROME: Bug, come on!
BRANDON: Get him! What are you doing?
l can't do this! BRANDON: But you must, or we'll die!
Alex: Come on, Bug.
just knock him down! That's all you have to do.
you know the rule
this is the police. Disperse immediately!
cops!
POLlCEMAN: You're in violation of the Riverton midnight curfew!
return to your homes immediately or your parents will face prosecution. Bug, run!
BRANDON: Police brutality!
POLlCEMAN: You want brutality?
I'll show you brutality!
BRANDON: God damn it!
Alex: Watch the tree, Jerome.
Alex: Sorry, Bug, sorry.
you're good?
he's still alive. lt's okay.
grab my hand.
l'm blind, Bug. Not you.
you good? Who's this?
JEROME: lt's not cool.
Alex: Why the hell are there cops here?
JAY: Jerome, big log. Big log.
get down.
what the fuck was that?
why did they stop us?
POLlCEMAN: Go home!
Ripper Day has been officially canceled.
JAY: Just better sit and wait.
why so glum, chum?
l failed.
because you couldn't kill him?
now we're all going to die, and it's my fault.
No! That's bullshit Brandon made up.
lf he was so worried about it, he should have killed it himself.
that puppet was scary. Thanks.
and the coat was creepy.
you added some moss and grass and shit, right?
Yeah, man, he lived under the river for like 16 years.
he's primeval, baby!
lf he rode in an ambulance on the way to the hospital, how did he get the coat and everything?
ln my version, the day after Plenkov supposedly drowned his house was burglarized, right?
and he took the boots, the coat, his whole outfit.
why would a burglar Just take clothes?
a burglar wouldn't, Bug.
but Plenkov would, if he was still alive!
Exactly! The Ripper's alive?
Alex: Could be. l thought you said he was Just a ghost.
no, he's dead.
no. Not necessarily. They never found his body.
and nobody really knew him or his wife very well.
they were new to Riverton. Yeah.
and, Plenkov could look completely different after 16 years!
like, cosmetic surgery, hair transplants, Weight Watchers.
and he could have changed his name.
snuck back into Riverton to get his revenge this year.
he could be Principal Pratt!
shut the fuck up!
l got to get home, guys.
wait, are you guys set for tomorrow?
for what?
JAY: The buzzard thing or whatever. Condor.
Yeah, we made a sock puppet.
a sock puppet? You'll put your class to sleep!
a good show- and- tell needs shock- and- awe!
lt's my fault.
l was too scared about tonight to think about it.
listen, Bug.
l'm scared of the Ripper, too. You are?
l got to cross that bridge twice a day.
l do what my grandma taught me.
spit in the river, and he won't come after me.
that works?
Yeah, for 16 years.
see you, guys! see you.
l got to go.
we should go, too.
Quint is going to kill me if he catches me out this late.
BOBBY: l don't know about this new curfew.
we should've let them kill him first.
PATERsON: Kill who?
Plenkov.
the Ripper.
very creative.
that's why every kid in Riverton has Ripper nightmares and the adults have memorial services.
lt's time to move on!
leave the past behind.
come on. Let's get out of here.
PATERsON: l'm glad they're getting rid of it.
rid of what?
that damn ambulance.
Pratt, the new principal at the high school convinced the chamber of commerce it was bad for tourism.
what?
no, no, no! lt's a memorial.
that's why it's still here.
tourism, Bob.
tourism is where everything is going.
'let's go to Riverton, honey, '
where that crazy fucker killed seven people and his wife. "
not.
JAY: What the hell?
fear ye the Ripper!
l spit in the river!
l spit in the river!
bug!
Alex!
No!
please, no!
what Just happened?
QUlNT: You better be in bed.
l'll kick your punk ass if you ain't!
lf you fuck with me, you'll be sorry!
shithead!
fear ye the Ripper.
Dr. COOPER ON RADlO: The California Condors are magnificent birds.
they can fly 15, 000 feet high, cruise at 55 miles per hour and cover 150 miles in a single day.
and they're so big, they're often mistaken for small airplanes on radar.
I mean... I mean, they're huge.
female RADlO HOsT: That's amazing.
you're listening to The Birding Hour, and the guest tonight is Dr. Richard Cooper, national expert on the California Condor and author of the bestselling book, Keeper of the souls.
please, Dr. Cooper, this is fascinating. Tell us some more.
Dr. COOPER: They've been pulled back from the brink of extinction a bit.
they're hanging in there.
the California Condor has always captured the imagination.
a Native American medicine man once said, " It's true that the condor literally eats death.
'but the great bird is not sickened by this.
'no, it has a secret.
'it keeps the souls of all the fallen creatures it consumes.
'and they are its treasure and its protection.
'and with each soul it takes in and shelters it grows larger and wiser.
'too large and wise to ever succumb to death itself. "
radlo HOsT: well, we all know that the California Condor was near extinction.
it's so nice to hear that they have a fighting chance now.
Dr. COOPER: Oh, they are surviving with the help of some terrific people.
and they have some very interesting ways of defending themselves, too.
radlo HOsT: Really? Could you share some of those?
Dr. COOPER: Not on the radio.
PENELOPE: And please watch over the missionaries, our soldiers in foreign lands, the President, Mom and Dad, and especially the seven of us, this day.
ls this the year? lt feels like it.
l know you can't tell me, but please keep Bug safe.
ln Jesus' name, amen.
Penelope's MOM: Penelope! lt's getting late.
l'm coming!
lt's getting late.
thank you. Message received.
crows, 10.
Snot- nosed kids, zip.
Ass- wipe!
get your little butt to school before l put my boot up it!
let's go!
now!
can you step back a little bit, Quint?
what's the matter? Don't you trust me?
of course l trust you.
don't trust anyone, you dumb shit.
Thanks, Quint. Felt good.
anytime!
l know you want me, Brittany.
speaking.
l've got today's assignment, Brandon.
got paper and pen? Of course l do.
bug Hellerman, three.
bug?
Alex Dunkelman, eight.
l need it done this morning.
Alex gets an eight?
you have a problem with that?
no, it's just that it's pretty high on Fang's punitive scale.
usually, giving an eight to the son of a felon comes with a bonus, is all.
don't say something stupid, Brandon.
nothing big.
a blowJob would do.
how about l have my dog bite it off and bury it in my backyard?
how big is your backyard?
woman ON RADlO: Good morning, Riverton.
it's hour 7
of Ripper Day 16.
and we're talking with Betty O'Neil, mother of Riverton star quarterback, Brandon O'Neil and head of the group, Citizens for a saner Riverton.
Mrs. O'Neil, why ban Ripper Day?
it's just kids having fun, isn't it?
betty: No, it's not kids having fun.
it's kids having nightmares, seeing the Ripper everywhere.
kids...
jumpy this morning, aren't we?
where is the sock puppet?
where did you come from?
your window, where else?
woman ON RADlO: Is Brandon damaged, do you think?
betty: Of course Brandon isn't...
what the fuck is that?
sock puppet.
on steroids?
kind of. Kind of?
only you wear it this time.
what? Excuse me?
like Jay said, " shock and awe. "
thought Edgar was a home crow.
raven. He's a guard.
he watches over you, you know?
you're still spooked by last night, right?
we were all watching the river and he came from the woods.
that's scary.
now, that's Jay's whole thing.
never do what they expect.
and now we got Edgar up there to keep him away. so...
you can have him if you want, after tonight.
Edgar. seriously?
Yeah. lt's your birthday.
well, thanks.
l should get you a present.
how about a weekend in Las Vegas with Brittany Cunningham?
Brittany doesn't know l'm alive. she's gonna, after two days and two nights of star- studded shows and high- stakes gambling.
Oh, yeah.
or l could just help you with that.
Yeah, that's Just as good.
lt's heavy.
lt's all the fluids.
fluids?
PENELOPE: The Lord is my shepherd.
l shall not want.
he leadeth me beside the still waters.
he restoreth my soul.
yea, though l walk through the valley of the shadow of death, l will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
thou anointest my head with oil.
my cup runneth over.
surely goodness and mercy will follow me through all the days of my life, and l will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Amen.
l know you're there, Lord.
and l know you're here.
Hello? MAY: You like it?
Yeah, it's great. Thanks, Mom.
I scotch- taped your number to it.
and mine, and 9- 1- 1.
happy birthday, Bug. I love you.
love you, too.
how do... do l close it?
hit the red button. Boom, done.
small! That bad?
no, that's good.
CHANDELLE: Jerome. Uh- oh.
get, Dunkelman.
Alex: Catch you later, Jerome.
what did l do now?
see you, Jerome.
lt's what you're not going to do, which is hang out with them.
why not?
lt's bad luck, is " why not. "
especially on Ripper Day.
you should totally come some year, Fang.
lt was wild!
like, Brandon set Bug up to fight the monster, which was huge, by the way.
and Bug, he was so scared.
Brandon didn't set Bug up.
l did.
do you know how to steam open an envelope so it doesn't show?
put it in the freezer for an hour.
lt opens itself and reseals perfectly.
this is to Bug. Oh, really?
here they come.
hold up, boys. What do you got there?
happy birthday, insect.
clueless as usual.
go.
Mr. Kaiser, sixth period biology.
lt'll be there.
Thanks, Jose.
so, you want to come over tonight?
we could burn the house down with my stepfather in it. Ha, ha, ha!
he give you anything for your birthday?
Yeah, a hematoma.
made it himself, too.
Oh! Behold, Bug, what light in yonder window breaks.
she is so beautiful.
she's hot for you, too.
you should go over there and talk to her.
excuse me, Officer Ramirez.
Maria told me you know all about baseball. Mmm- hmm. Uh- oh.
RAMlREZ: What do you want to know?
distraction maneuver.
run!
bug. This is a three.
Dunkelman, this is an eight.
that's the way the cookie crumbles.
Dunkelman, stay away from the Fang Zone.
and you, you stay away from him.
Alex: Thanks, Brandon.
felt good.
BRANDON: Ass- wipe.
not as good as your mother felt last night, though.
just bought yourself a 20.
Brandon O'Neil.
do not bring the wrath of Jehovah down upon you.
your sins are already a stench in the nostrils of an angry God.
like knocking up Melanie Pratt, who's only 15 and the principal's daughter.
what? Melanie's pregnant?
she's in my prayer group. Duh!
what men will do to you in prison is nothing compared to what demons will do to you in Hell.
on beds of fire. Through all eternity.
l'm going to get you for this, Penelope.
lf you do, God will get you, Brandon, and it won't be pretty.
when you least expect it, Dunkelman.
Hi, Bug! Hi.
happy birthday!
Thanks, Penelope. same to you.
did you get my note?
note?
l left it in your mailbox.
no.
lt doesn't matter. What?
pray for our souls, Bug. He's coming.
Jesus?
we should be so lucky.
don't forget me.
rise up and gird your loins, Alex.
the end is near.
why is Penelope always saying weird stuff like that?
parallel universe, baby.
l don't understand her, sometimes.
l mean, the way she said that.
pray for our souls, Bug.
he's coming.
what if she meant the Ripper?
l'm scared.
we're 16, Bug.
like it or not, we're men now.
l don't feel like a man. No man does.
that's why you got to fake it.
fake being a man to be a man?
that's the way it works. so, you can't run.
you have to face your fear like a man.
even though l'm not a man?
because you're not a man.
listen, the better you fake it, the better man you are.
just fake it? Well, fake it good.
like, if you're scared, act like you don't give a shit.
or if somebody hurts you, say, " Thank you very much. That felt wonderful. "
Thanks, Brandon.
l can't raise my arm. Feels good.
Yeah, there you go.
that all you got, Brandon?
l mean, l feel downright cheated.
l'm amazed that you're getting this so quick.
lt's tricky stuff.
l was faking that l did.
you were? Completely.
Yeah, but you were faking it good.
l was? Abso- fucking- lutely.
you now have permission to shave.
Mr. KAlsER: As you know, class, we're nearing the end of our reports on living creatures.
dogs, fish, honeybees.
we had an especially nice one from Brittany Cunningham last session on the butterflies of our state.
today's presentation will be by Adam Hellerman and Alex Dunkelman.
are you boys ready?
boys? ALEX: Bug, come on.
Mr. KAlsER: While we're young. Get up!
l believe this is yours.
'back from the Brink. "
by Adam Hellerman and Alex Dunkelman.
Brandon.
our subJect today is about a bird.
you having another one of your migraines, Adam?
shock and awe!
Adam!
our subJect today is the largest bird in North America.
unchanged since the Pleistocene Epoch and only recently rescued from extinction.
l present to you Gymnogyps californianus.
anus.
Mr. KAlsER: Brandon, second warning.
the California Condor.
good Lord.
are you ready?
fly, now!
his wingspan is 10 feet wide.
his body, more than four feet high.
he can weigh as much as 350 parrots.
as for soaring, he can glide effortlessly for days until he finds his food, which is carrion.
a dead, stinking body crawling with maggots is ice- cream to him.
Mr. KAlsER: Bug.
just showmanship, Mr. Kaiser.
the facts are correct.
a California Condor can consume the carcass of a cow in one day.
bullshit.
and if anyone tries to harm it, if anyone even so much as touches one of its feathers,
just one...
what are you going to do?
going to bite me, asshole?
the bird will vomit copiously on its tormentor.
and if that doesn't work, the great bird has another defense, too.
bottle two, Alex!
BRANDON: What the hell is that?
and that is why no one should ever screw with the California Condor.
thank you, Brandon. That felt so good.
Alex and l would like to thank you all for your kind attention.
hall pass. Go!
GlRL: That was so wrong!
didn't mean to scare you. You okay?
Yeah.
bug, that was amazing.
Oh, my God, that suit was genius.
l felt like Mothra.
how'd you come up with that? l don't know.
have a good puke? Couldn't.
try the finger thing? Nothing.
bummer.
we should get out of here.
Brandon's really mad now, l guess.
you don't know the half of it.
Brandon is way past mad.
he's been humiliated twice in two hours in front of Brittany.
he's approaching nuclear.
but he's not the one we got to worry about.
he's not? No, it's Fang.
Brandon only does what she tells him to do.
the fish stinks from the head.
why would Fang want to hurt us?
you? l don't know.
me, l got caught outside the girls' bathroom between 2: 00 and 2: 30.
that's when Fang and her crew talk business.
anybody caught in the Fang Zone during that half hour is treated like a spy.
just because you were out there doesn't mean you were spying.
l was spying.
there's a revolution going on here.
fang must fall!
fang, fall?
like the mob.
we need to get something on her so incriminating that she has to leave us common folk alone.
lf only we had some sort of listening device.
Hello?
Condor? Crow.
fang and her crew arrive in the bathroom in three minutes.
everyone else clears out five before.
that means we have a window of two minutes, starting now.
window?
to get your phone in there.
ln the girls' bathroom?
l'm sure Brittany is going to be there, as well, talking about you.
we could gather that kind of intelligence, also.
talking about me? Yeah, yeah.
you amazed her back there in biology, Bug.
she saw a new man standing there, fascinated, powerful, daring.
get your phone in there. You're going to hear it with your own ears.
but now, you only got a minute, 45.
what if there's somebody in there?
no, no. l got that covered.
l'm sorry. sorry, sorry. Wrong bathroom, Jerome!
yours is down the hall, around the corner.
did l scare anyone else?
no one else is in there, but it's a Fang Zone in 30 seconds.
glrl 1: Let's go! Come on, hurry up. GlRL 2: l am!
clear.
can you hear me? Ten seconds!
go!
come on, come on, come on.
Brittany, window, Chandelle, door,
Maria, you've got five.
go.
the sophomores have paid another year's protection for their bikes.
and the answers to next week's organic chemistry test are selling briskly.
bottom line, $2, 000 in the bank.
we got her.
good numbers.
speaking of numbers, apparently this morning there was a problem with Brandon giving the punitives?
a three and an eight, l believe.
the numbers were administered properly and on schedule, however, before Brandon could leave the area,
Penelope Bryte came out of nowhere and told him he was going to hell.
Brandon would enJoy hell.
kick some ass, take names.
there something you're not telling me?
well, Maria's dad was there.
l thought l told you to distract him with the baseball stuff.
l did, but Penelope's yelling got your father looking straight at us.
maybe Penelope needs a 10.
a 10? A 10?
what's her story, anyway?
she's obsessed with Bug.
girls find him attractive.
do you?
what?
find Bug attractive.
no, of course not.
sorry.
he's a lunatic, Brittany.
a brain- bomb waiting to go off.
his only real friend is Dunkelman, and Dunkelman
just uses him as his monkey.
he's been in and out institutions half his life.
bug has killed people.
killed people? Monkey?
wake up and smell the starbucks.
you're right.
he's pathetic.
Brandon's the one for you, Brit.
he's a diamond. ln the rough, l'll admit but a diamond just the same.
by comparison, Bug is a lump of coal.
trust me on this.
okay?
okay, Fang.
good girl.
bug, don't run away.
stop it. Bug, say, " Thanks, Fang, that felt great. "
l'd be lying.
that's the point.
Thanks, Fang. That felt great.
that felt fucking great.
that's a bad word.
be bad. lt makes things good.
everything's backwards with you.
just fake you're bad.
Thanks, Fang. That felt fucking great.
that felt fucking great.
good. But you do have to do one more thing.
l can't handle another fucking thing, okay?
you've got to get your phone back.
are you fucking kidding me?
l'm not fucking kidding you.
they're going to find it, they're going to trace it they're going to call your mom.
she's going to have to come in and get humiliated by Principal Pratt.
no fucking way!
way.
and enough with the " fucks " now.
you say " fuck. "
you're not me, okay? You're not me, okay?
stop it. stop it.
bug? Bug?
bug. Bug.
cut it out. Cut it out.
bug. Bug! Bug. Bug! Bug! Bug!
what Just happened?
nothing.
do you think l'm a monkey, Alex?
have you killed people, Bug?
not that l can remember.
well, l can't remember buying you bananas either.
l'll be right back.
Alex: Keep it down in there.
bug?
where are you?
what's taking you so long?
bug?
bug, someone's coming.
BRlTTANY: Alex, what are you doing here?
Alex: Hi, Brittany.
Brittany, why are you going back into the bathroom?
BRlTTANY: l forgot my purse. None of your business.
Alex: lncoming!
BRlTTANY: Hello? Please say this is a nightmare.
please say this is a nightmare. Anyone in there?
Hello? Who locked this?
he probably Just fell in.
accidents happen.
lf Jeanne- Baptiste is down there, we're not talking accident.
l could fucking feel it coming.
Yeah. You couldn't feel shit.
PATERsON: No, l could.
give me a minute, all right?
JEANNE: Hey, Frank. Hey.
he's been dead at least 12 hours.
what the hell hit him, Jeanne?
two miles of this, for starters.
any knife wounds?
nothing obvious.
could take an autopsy to know for sure.
come on.
JEANNE: What?
you're not thinking what l think you're thinking, are you?
PATERsON: What are you thinking?
probably there was alcohol last night.
might have gotten tipsy on his way home.
kid's in my 12- step. JEANNE: sorry.
well, we'll know quick enough.
the autopsy will tell us if there's any alcohol levels in the blood or any water in the lungs.
and l'll check for a knife wound.
l will.
sixteenth anniversary.
one and six is seven.
we didn't let them kill him last night, first time.
and it was Bug's turn.
lt's kind of funny.
l get scientific in 16 years and you go voodoo on me.
what did your grandmother say?
what?
did she tell you not to worry if somebody you thought was dead Just might come back alive?
lf he was evil enough?
call me when you know something, yeah?
okay.
connecticut Condor?
turkey Vulture.
you find Jay?
no, weird. He always answers.
l saw him.
where?
ln the boys' bathroom mirror.
he was in the river, l think.
he tried to say something, but...
bug, it's best not to think about your nightmares today.
lt wasn't a nightmare.
whatever it was.
look, all seven of us are on edge today.
seeing the Ripper in all sorts of weird places.
lt's like Brandon said, the way the cookie crumbles.
for us. Just for today.
you're a condor.
you eat death for breakfast, remember that.
where you going?
call me after Pratt.
pervert.
l'm sorry l screamed.
l don't blame you.
you should get out more, Bug.
shop. lt's what l do when l'm scared.
you're scared?
angry, is what l meant to say.
glrl 1: Stay safe.
glrl 2: Don't let the Ripper get you.
you idot
payback time!
think twice, Jockstrap!
you know what Fang would do if she knew you were moonlighting.
Yeah, well, nobody's looking.
but somebody's listening, sasquatch.
think about it.
l tell Chandelle, she tells Fang.
we all know how Fang doesn't like you off your little leash.
she'll mark you.
put you in the river with concrete flippers.
that's actually Just peachy, you know.
l'll let Ripper get you two.
you know, Bug, a lot of people have seen him already today.
lt's not even dark.
must be scary living in a house with no father to protect you.
you know, l bet if you look up " rectum " in the dictionary they would have a picture of Brandon there.
you don't know fear, Bug.
you puked on Brandon O'Neil.
you're a hero of the revolution.
Hey, Penelope.
Hey, Jerome.
what was it this time?
you're wearing those squeaky shoes again.
you can really hear that?
got to go. see you.
see you.
Hey. Hey.
so, l heard you're seeing Principal Pratt?
ln 15 minutes.
they called my mom at work.
l'm doomed.
we're all doomed, Bug.
lt's the human condition.
the next life's the thing to focus on.
lt's Melanie Pratt.
she wants me to pray with her.
you want to come?
l'll be with Father Pratt.
right. Well,
God hears you, wherever you are.
lf things get too hot, Just turn on the prayer- conditioning.
bug, it's best not to think about your nightmares today.
I've got to cross that bridge twice a day.
shop. That's what l do when l'm scared.
you don't know what fear is, Bug.
you puked in Brandon O'Neil's face.
I mean, you're a hero of the revolution.
must be pretty scary sleeping in a house no father to protect you. PENELOPE: Cops!
lf things get too hot, Just turn up the prayer- conditioning.
fear ye the Ripper!
PENELOPE: Lord, this is a sin not of hate but of love.
so please remember, you put the apple and the happy little snake together in one small garden, so, you know things can happen now and then.
and Just wrap your arms around Melanie and let her know that, no matter what, you're there for her and love her to pieces.
Amen.
Thanks, Penelope.
now you.
l'm so ashamed.
don't be.
lt's a baby, not a bomb.
Lord, it might as well be a bomb.
l mean, l feel so guilty.
but you know how Brandon is.
'please, please, pretty please. "
but l still should have said no.
he said it would make me feel special.
lt hasn't. lt's made me feel fat and stupid.
my father will be the laughingstock.
my mother will probably die.
my little sister Amy, she'll Join a cult or something.
who is that?
Melanie!
Melanie, run!
Melanie?
RlPPER: Die now.
lf l should die before l wake...
pratt: Adam? ...l pray the Lord our souls to take.
Adam?
Adam, Principal Pratt asked you a question.
the end is near.
did you know your daughter's pregnant?
what?
she's in my prayer group. Duh.
bug!
l'm sorry. l'm not myself, Mom.
Mr. Pratt, what was the question?
lt's not important.
you can go now, Adam.
and take your creature with you.
your mom and l are going to chat for a while.
we'll speak at home, Bug.
straight home. All right.
l'm so sorry.
l don't think he got much sleep last night.
Yes, Ripper Night.
lt's an outrage that it's lasted this long.
and for a sensitive child like Adam, it can be especially dangerous.
l was checking Adam's file and it's remarkable, not so much for what's in it, but for what's not.
pardon?
l've been a principal here for six months and l can find no medical files for him, except his vaccination records, of course, which are the one thing he absolutely must have in order to attend school here.
bug has no medical issues, really.
lf he did, we'd have no way of knowing, would we?
l'm his mother, l would. Well, that's right.
you're a nurse at Riverton Community.
head Nurse, OBlGYN.
uh- huh.
are Adam's records there?
Adam has never been hospitalized.
has Adam ever been tested? Neurologically, l mean.
Neurologically? Why would he be?
well, since l've been principal here, he's awakened twice in study hall screaming.
he's got chronic migraines.
he's claustrophobic.
claustrophobic?
last year, l was told a friend put him in an empty locker Just for fun and he was so hysterical he had to be sent home.
Brandon O'Neil is no friend.
he's a bully who never gets more than slap on the wrist.
l'm talking about Adam here, Ms. Hellerman.
he has serious issues.
and today he terrorized a classroom with this monstrous bird that he built.
lt vomited on them.
and worse, he's obsessed with this California buzzard.
not a hummingbird, not a robin, not an American eagle, but a bird that eats dead things.
california Condor.
whatever. lt eats dead things.
native Americans considered it sacred.
lt cleans the earth to make room for new life.
maybe they understood something we don't.
l want you to listen to me very carefully.
tomorrow, l am sending Adam for psychological testing to a state facility in Boston.
you what? For Adam's safety and the safety of the normal students in this school.
lt is my responsibility, and it is my legal right to do so.
Brandon's the one for you, Brit. He's a diamond.
a diamond in the rough, l admit, but a diamond Just the same.
compared to him, Bug's a lump of coal.
BRlTTANY: l know. Church in two hours.
l'll be there.
l'll be home in two shakes. Bye.
Hey, Brittany!
training for the marathon, Brandon?
Yeah. You know, l got to keep in shape.
you're in great shape.
you got time for that oral?
you're like a crotch dog.
you know, the kind that stick their nose in your crotch when you're not looking?
lt's like a handshake, really.
my father had a crotch dog.
mom had it put out of its misery.
misery is what l'm talking about.
come on, Brittany, l went the extra mile for you today.
l could've gotten expelled for that eight.
Plus, l got shit on twice.
once by a Jesus freak, once by a fucking buzzard.
Condor.
BRANDON: lt's Just got me tense.
BRlTTANY: Start a hobby.
this is my hobby.
besides, it's my birthday.
lt's all of our birthdays.
l know, but l need it. And l want it.
lt should make you feel special.
come on. Fang thinks we're a good match.
fang doesn't run my private life.
does she know that?
because l could bring her up to speed.
you threatening me?
l'm begging you.
ln the woods.
you hate the woods.
lt's spring. l'm feeling romantic.
count to 60.
you tricking me? l got a temper.
you're not the only one.
BRANDON: sixty seconds.
fifty.
Forty- two.
thirty.
fifteen.
three.
Hey, Brittany!
Hey, you fucking bitch!
Hey!
Hey! Wait!
BRANDON: Hey, Brittany! Where did you go?
Brittany!
Brittany!
Penelope?
Penelope.
now you're going to get it.
Hello?
BRlTTANY: Just because she embarrassed you in front of me, you killed her?
you are going to burn in hell.
what?
better start running the other way, Brandon.
I've called the police.
what? No, no.
Brittany, Brittany. Don't! Don't!
Brittany, Brittany, Brittany!
please don't get me arrested, all right?
l knocked up Principal Pratt's daughter.
he'll have me murdered in my cell.
Hey, do you understand what l'm saying?
Brittany, look, l know you're there.
l can hear you walking. Just...
l understand that you don't want to talk.
l probably disgust you.
lt's okay, l disgust myself, sometimes.
l know l'm a pig.
l can't help it.
No! Pigs are nicer.
actually, l'm Just what you said.
l'm a fucking crotch dog.
l'm sorry.
RlPPER: It's too late to be sorry.
who is this?
someone from your past.
you wouldn't remember.
put Brittany on, please.
she's not here.
well, where is she?
where you're going to go.
l'm going to go to the church.
no, you're not.
what do you mean, " No, l'm not? "
think hotter.
Miami?
RlPPER: Try hell!
anybody you want to say goodbye to?
my unborn child.
fuck your fucking unborn child.
now, where did l leave your bitch?
what?
whose phone?
Oh, my God.
operator: This is Riverton 9- 1- 1.
please hold.
all our circuits are busy.
we will get to your call as soon as we can.
be home, Bug Hellerman.
may: Okay, 10: 00 a. m. Boston Psychiatric Clinic.
l got to go.
l'm sorry l'm so late.
you should be.
have a seat. You're too big to spank.
okay.
sweater.
did you fall?
l was burying a friend.
my condor.
Brandon ruined it. l gave it a decent burial.
you gave me a start.
why, you think l killed somebody?
no, of course not.
make a wish.
do you want to know what l wished for?
no.
l wished that l could take back what l did today and make you proud of me instead.
l was trying to get my phone back, the one you gave me, and unfortunately, l fell into the toilet.
my phone fell into Brittany Cunningham's bag and l didn't have a chance to get it out.
what was your phone doing in the girls' bathroom in the first place?
we were trying to gather some information about something.
don't tell me. You and Alex?
l wanted to know what Brittany thought of me.
Brittany Cunningham?
she's a little sophisticated for you, isn't she?
l like her.
so did you find out what she thinks of you?
she thinks he's a retard like everyone else.
do not use that word in this house!
lt's okay.
just because Leah says mean things, doesn't make them so.
what if they are so?
what?
they are.
watch your nuts, little squirrel.
Leah told Brittany that l had been in institutions.
that l had killed people.
have l?
Leah will say anything.
you don't have the most supportive sister in the world.
who are you calling?
your phone.
mom! Come on, Mom. No, please.
Hey. Hey.
Penelope Bryte.
done with a knife, Just like the others.
Oh, fuck.
Hey, Frank!
keeps going to voicemail.
she's with Brandon.
how did you know that?
l Just do.
time for presents.
well, this is a first.
l don't give gifts Just to give them, May.
gifts should mean something.
happy sweet 16th.
what is it?
open it.
l don't understand.
bug! Huh?
go to your room, now!
what did l do?
just go!
what?
no, leave that thing here.
Leah gave it to me, so l guess it's mine.
how could you?
somebody's got to bust his cherry.
l'm sorry to hit you.
but you deserve it.
your friends are calling, May.
they want you at the church so you can all lie to each other again.
you know? How God works in mysterious ways and how everything works out for the good if you Just keep repeating the lies.
like, " The Ripper's dead, he's not coming back. "
would it kill you to look at things positively Just once, Leah?
you're scared of being human.
you get your friends to do your dirty work.
you're still in high school at 19
because you're too chicken- shit to get on with your life.
you hide behind what should be dead and buried.
like you hide behind me and Bug?
and my mother?
no, l did what l did to save Bug from what you've become.
and because my sister had more heart and courage on any given day than you have had in your whole miserable life!
fuck you, May.
Hi. Fuck you, too!
Leah.
Thanks, Leah.
that felt good.
why do you hate me?
l've never done anything to you.
you've ruined my life!
that's what you've done, you little shit!
Why?
Why?
l will tell you why, maggot.
from the moment you were born everything went to shit for me!
you were the miracle baby, and l was the painful reminder!
you got to live in this dream and l got stuck in a fucking nightmare!
l am sick to death of your innocence!
lt is an insult to me!
why am l innocent?
you are so clueless, it is stunning!
tell me.
do you know who your father was?
may said that he loved us very much.
but who was he?
l don't know. He died in a car crash.
on the way to the hospital to be with May when she was having you, right?
Yeah.
what a sad, yet beautiful story.
have you ever asked yourself why May doesn't ever talk about him?
or why there isn't a single fucking picture of him around the house?
maybe it's too painful.
do you know who Abel Plenkov was?
the Riverton Ripper?
besides that?
no.
take a look in the mirror, Bug.
abel: Remember how much l loved you, Leah.
Leah, unlock the door for Daddy.
Leah, don't! Don't listen to him!
get out of my way!
now you're going to get it!
Leah!
Leah.
PATERsON: Freeze!
abel: Open the door, you little bitch!
GUs: Get over here. We got a live fetus.
abel: Open the door for Daddy!
you did good, Mama.
we'll take good care of your boy.
Leah?
go away.
open the door, Leah.
do you want to die?
get out of my room!
fuck!
there. We're even.
where did you get that?
there's a revolution going on, Fang.
Hi.
Hi.
fang: Hello? ls Leah okay?
Leah's fine.
are you? You look...
l know you're not my mother.
bug, l'm so sorry. l never meant...
l hope you know something, too.
what?
that you are my mom.
that one you're stuck with, like it or not.
Marla: Fang, you still there?
are you still there?
are you okay?
Maria Just called.
they found Jay Chan in the river this morning.
No!
Penelope Bryte near the old ambulance.
Brandon and Brittany in the woods nearby.
l was a total shit to her today, and she's dead.
may: How can that be?
fang: You know how that can be, May.
our father is still alive.
may: Let's wait to see what really happened.
what's really happening, May, he's killing his way through the Riverton seven.
he'll get Jerome, and Dunkelman, and then he'll come for us.
no.
we'll go to the church and be with the others.
l'll go to church with you, May.
but this is the last time.
and l'm sorry, but l had to tell him.
l'll get the car and be out front.
get Bug, okay?
bug.
Leah? Ready?
l figured you'd come.
Really?
have you heard?
l've heard. l've heard a lot.
Oh?
the Riverton Ripper, Abel Plenkov?
yeah?
he was my father.
that l know.
you do?
the parents of all the seven know.
l think l'm the only kid.
my mother told me the day she died.
why didn't anyone tell me?
sorry, we thought you were too...
l don't know.
lnnocent?
l guess.
well, l'm not anymore.
Yeah. l can see that.
who beat you up?
Fang.
figures.
Penelope sent me a letter.
a love letter?
no.
she wrote to warn me that he'd be coming back for us.
my father.
she had a source.
Oh, yeah. she say anything else?
she said that there are two ways that he can come from.
one, if he survived 16 years ago, then he'll come back as Abel Plenkov.
dad.
option two?
option two is he did die and his soul went into one of the seven kids who were born the night he died.
hopped the nearest bus.
ln this version, he's one of us killing all the rest.
attack from the unexpected direction.
Yeah.
there's not many of us left to be unexpected, though.
you, me and Jerome.
Jerome's not a very good candidate. Mmm- mmm.
so, you or me.
that's option two.
well, l like option one better.
makes more sense.
the Ripper who was stabbed and shot had a little fender- bender, ended up in the river , no biggie.
he patched himself up with stuff from the ambulance.
survives on acorns and crawfish for 16 years.
so he Just crawled out of the river in a rotting overcoat to take his revenge.
l'll Just call the cops and tell them to keep an eye out for the Unabomber's evil twin.
or not.
what's that?
the biggest knife l could find in the kitchen.
bug...
what would you say if l told you l was going to kill you, Alex?
l'd say you weren't.
why not?
because you're my best friend.
you're Bug.
now you ask me.
you don't think l could kill somebody?
no.
you'd be wrong, Bug.
dead wrong.
you killed Penelope and Jay?
and the others?
of course not.
l killed my stepfather.
you killed Quint?
he was drunk.
he hit me.
for the first time in my life, l hit him back.
fell down the steps and broke his stupid neck.
Alex, it's okay, okay?
no, it's not okay!
what l did... lt's not okay for everybody to be killing each other all the time!
you don't want something to drink?
you got rat poison?
no, we Just ran out of rat poison.
l'm going to go get you water.
what is this?
Alex, l'll be right...
Ripper?
son of a bitch!
drop the knife, Bug.
now.
kick it over to me.
l'm sorry, l thought you were somebody else.
get your hands up. Up.
walk slow.
why are you pointing that at me?
that is far enough.
Why?
your phone was found next to Brittany Cunningham's body.
lt fell into her purse at school.
that was an accident.
you can ask my mom.
your mom is why l have to arrest you, Bug.
mom!
easy!
stay there.
l was there when they cut you out of your mother,
bug.
you were the one thing that made the whole bloody mess bearable.
a fucking...Miracle?
Yes!
something bright in the dark.
and ever since, for all of us that were there, Bug, that's what you've been.
fuck. How could you do this?
l didn't.
hold out your hands, son.
Where's my sister?
why don't you tell me?
RlPPER: lt's time.
RlPPER: They never should've cut you out of your dead mother.
RlPPER: What happened to your wings, angel?
RlPPER: Fucking piece of shit!
where is the knife?
shut the fuck up.
shut up.
RlPPER: Come out, come out, wherever you are.
lt's not as bad as it looks.
how did you get away?
l was already in the car.
l came inside Just to see where May was, and l found her dead.
l knew that fucker would come for us.
maybe he's gone.
no, no, no.
let's go.
l think we should...
die! Die! Die!
l saved you for last!
fuck!
Leah, call the cops.
fang: Son of a bitch!
Hey. Leah, l need you to get the lights on.
get out of the house, get to the neighbors and call the cops.
you think you can do that for me?
what are you going to do?
l'm going to give that fucker a 10.
make it a 20.
Ripper?
shit!
Jerome! Jerome, stop it! Jerome! Hey, hey! Hey!
Jerome. Jerome.
the Ripper's up here, Bug.
watch out.
lt's okay, Jerome. He's gone, all right?
what are you doing here?
you're supposed to be at the church.
Alex called me.
he said all three of us should be together.
watch each other's backs.
l was halfway through the window when the Ripper stabbed me.
how did he get up here?
he must have come up the rope like l did.
l passed out on the roof, and then l came to and l heard fighting. Was that you?
him and me. Yeah, it was.
he was kicking my ass, too.
l tried calling the cops but l knocked over something, and then l heard him coming for me, so l ducked for the closet.
you saved my life, Jerome.
l did?
Yeah, he was going to kill me, and then you distracted him.
good.
dude, it's going to be okay.
help is coming, all right?
you fought the Ripper, Bug.
you're a hero, like l told you.
l'm not a hero, Jerome. l'm Just...
Jerome?
Jerome?
what the fuck happened to you?
what happened to Jerome?
he's dead.
the Ripper got him.
a lot's happened since you've been gone, Alex.
where did you disappear to?
l saw Paterson pulling up outside.
l ran. l hid in the woods.
then l heard gunshots, so l came back.
l was afraid he shot you or something.
where is he, anyway?
downstairs. He's dead.
what? What happened?
the Ripper happened.
he killed Mom, too.
may?
l can't believe this.
you went to get me a glass of water and now your mom, Paterson, and Jerome are dead?
where were you?
l ran into Penelope.
Penelope is dead, Bug.
l saw her in the bathroom mirror.
she brought me Ripper's knife, and she made me take it.
then l heard something downstairs and l went to come check on you, and you were gone.
paterson wasn't after you. He was after me.
he thought that l killed Brittany and my Mom.
lt was the Ripper.
and where is the Ripper now?
l guess he got away out my window.
or went out Leah's.
hers is open, too.
and he tried to stab me to death with his...
stab you with what?
with his knife.
l thought you had his knife.
l did, but...
did you kill them, Bug?
what? No, l...
l didn't kill anybody.
not that you remember.
bug, l got to tell you something.
and don't get upset.
what?
my mom told me this.
your father was first diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 16.
just like you are now.
what are you saying?
lt's hereditary.
Plus, you were in your dead Mom forever.
oxygen deprivation. lt can make you crazy, too.
maybe all this stuff you've been describing didn't happen exactly the way you're saying it did.
you think l'm crazy?
no, l don't know what l think.
but l'm not walking away.
l've stuck by you through everything.
through nightmares and migraines, hell, puking vultures when everybody else was calling you a ticking time bomb.
so, if you're not innocent anymore, that's okay.
l mean, l killed my stepfather tonight. l'm no angel, either.
l'm not innocent anymore, Alex.
not with all of them inside me now.
what?
with who inside you?
the rest of the Riverton seven.
even Jerome.
all their souls are with me now.
bug, maybe you should sit down and take a few deep breaths.
you think l'm crazy?
l'm actually a lot smarter than l was yesterday.
let me ask you a question.
why is there blood on your left ear?
what?
the top.
almost like you were hit with a vase or something.
Brandon told me to look for that.
bug, you are officially bat- shit nuts.
l scraped it climbing up the roof.
come on, let's get real, here.
Jay says that Ripper's getup was a costume for sure.
Oh, and Brittany has run a timeline.
you would've had enough time to kill Mom and put the knife in the bathroom sink while l was hiding under the bed and Leah was outside in the car.
and if Jerome came through the window when l was in the bathroom getting you water, you would've had time to stab him, and go downstairs and kill Paterson.
you might have tried to kill me, too.
fuck. But if you'd heard Jerome upstairs, you would've had to get up there before he called the cops.
l could've killed you off earlier, remember?
bug, you've watched one too many Law and Order reruns.
besides, l'm a little guy.
you could beat me up in, like, 10 seconds.
unless you had the bad soul in you.
and then you would fight like you were possessed.
can't fucking believe you.
you're Adam Plenkov!
the son of a mass murderer!
everybody in your house, and all your friends, except me, have been murdered.
lf there's a bad soul here, you have it.
and you got it from your father.
maybe you have been in institutions.
maybe you have killed people, Just in your last life.
but you're too stupid and blind to see that.
maybe they'll find your Ripper costume buried along with your stupid condor outfit.
and they will come for you with torches.
what?
l didn't bury any Ripper costume with my condor.
somebody did.
you son of a...
evil doesn't forget betrayal, Plenkov.
you and the other sick Dr. Blake got me and then ran away like cowards.
jumped into the first babies you could hide in.
so l saved you for last.
and l'll kill you now, or you can say yes to a deal.
what deal?
same one l offered your father, 16 years ago today.
say yes, and you live.
say no, and l'll cut your throat.
say yes to what?
to my happy ending of Riverton's fairytale.
there was no Ripper. Just one of the Riverton seven that was a little crazy, dressed up like the Ripper, killed your mom, and Paterson, and four of his birth- mates before we finally stopped him.
one of the Riverton seven?
the one of the seven with the bad soul.
the Ripper's soul.
Jerome?
great twist, huh?
everybody will think you were the killer but it turns out the attack came from a totally unexpected direction.
you'd lay all this on Jerome?
he won't mind. He's dead.
you and me will be Main- street heroes helping each other forge a new beginning.
recovering from our tragic losses.
friends to the end.
what do you say?
deal?
you're pathetic.
l don't even think you're Alex.
l don't know who you are.
l'm the one that's going to kill you if you don't say yes.
and then l'll say you did it.
and l'll be the hero all by myself.
Leah saw the whole fight.
she'll vouch for me.
Leah doesn't live through the night.
that's part of the deal, too.
whoever or whatever you are, get out of Alex.
and go back to hell, where you came from.
l mean it.
okay.
but l'll take you with me.
l thought that guy would never leave.
Alex.
where is the biggest knife in the kitchen?
where it needs to be.
Condor?
crow.
lt's all right, Bug. Feels great.
feels fucking great.
fucking great.
fly now.
l know you're up there.
and l know we're down here.
cop 1: Police! COP 2: Police! Open the door!
open up!
open the door!
open the door now!
I am the condor.
the Keeper of the souls.
I eat death for breakfast.
I live in a house of blood and I accept that.
cop 3: Break it down!
that's all a man can do.
I was ready to be arrested that night.
I wasn't ready for what happened instead.
Leah had told them everything, and I was celebrated as a hero.
don't worry about it, man. They're on your side.
Alex Dunkelman killed his stepfather, a cop, a mother and five of the Riverton seven.
your sister's right over there.
and I alone had stopped him from killing more.
I didn't feel like a hero at all.
Adame
but if it makes Riverton feel safe at night, I'll fake that I'm their hero.
and I'll fake it good.
Alex wouldn't have it any other way.
my father told me about you guys.
listen, I know when you were younger, my father was probably cranky and liked to be left alone, but he is pretty sick now, and I'm taking care of him.
this isn't some spooky house.
there are no dastardly plans.
just a sick old man on a respirator.
so could you please leave my father to pass in peace?
sorry.
sorry.
your father was a great man.
why'd you do it, McGint...?
sorry.
Yeah, I did that.
Charlie. Come in, Charlie.
code 44 at Mrs. Kimmel's house.
I'm on it.
still warm.
that means it was hot when someone stuck their finger in there.
Eric McDonald.
joshua McDonald. - Eric McDonald.
Eric McDonald.
and we know his spot.
Hi. My name's Sammy.
I'm new to this school.
know where I can get some pie around here?
fuck, the Mystery Team.
I gotcha.
of course you got me, motherfucker.
you're 18.
if any teachers ask where Eric went, tell them three grownups took him off the playground to teach him a lesson about sticking his finger in things.
Yep. Boysenberry, all right.
only one question remains, Eric.
why'd you do it?
I'll bet you he gets his kicks giving old ladies the heebie-jeebies.
hell, no. I wanted to see if it felt like pussy, like in that movie.
Yeah.
well, you learned your lesson, so try and stay on the straight and narrow this time.
okay?
he's a good kid at heart.
faggots.
Hey, Dad, can I have the car keys?
there go three virgins.
excuse me. Is this the principal's office?
come in, Jason.
Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Jason.
I am Jason's father, and I just came down here to say that he will be punished, so there is no need to suspend him or call me, Jason's father.
I get a frantic call from Mr. Daniels over at Wilson Elementary, telling me that one of his students was taken off the premises by you.
do you know how serious that is?
Jason, Jason, Jason.
can you believe I'm his father?
Jason, I mean.
Jason, take off the mustache.
we meet again, old friend.
sorry I'm late, everybody.
my science teacher says my thesis needs to prove something, but I think listing all the dinosaurs proves there was a lot of dinosaurs.
Duncan, we got the yearbooks in today, and some of the staff was a little confused.
why did you fuck us?
Oh, my Trivia Corner.
you guys are stumped.
there's actually an answer key in the back.
no one said you could have a Trivia Corner.
well, Caleb, I just saw there was a blank page, - so I figured... - You're an asshole.
look, we're trying to sell yearbooks.
I figured people would want to match wits with the boy genius.
you're not a boy genius.
you just got a book of some Wacky Facts in second grade and memorized them because no one wants to be your friend except those two retards on your Mystery Team.
catch you guys later.
catch you guys later.
can you help me get started on the ramp?
I'll do you one better.
just... - I got it. I'm so close.
let me stay on the ramp.
dude, dude, dude, Hold on, hold on!
you all right.
Yeah. Thank you.
I must work on that stuff.
Hey, man, can you stop staring at us in the halls?
it's creepy.
Yeah, okay.
see you at practice.
no, you won't. You're not on the team.
you can't just say that.
look, I know when you were younger, the whole town, myself included, was very amused by you and the Mystery Kids.
mystery Team, okay?
mystery Team.
people used to call us heroes.
and it really razzes my berries when people don't take us seriously.
I mean, look how big my magnifying glass is.
your head's big.
put that down. That's enough.
you're an adult. Act like one.
you're excused.
I cannot wait to graduate in a month.
I'm so tired of school.
Yeah, I wish they'd all disappear like the Lost Colony of Roanoke.
they'd probably go What's Roanoke?
and I'd go "Shut up, Caleb."
all we need is one big case before people start respecting us again, like people did when we were 7.
people respect us.
Charlie, where's your book bag?
some kids took it and filled it with dirt.
Hi, Mom. - Hi.
Hi, Mrs. Rogers. You look nice.
thank you, Charlie.
Yeah, when I look at you, it feels like my body's smiling, you know?
Yeah.
so got any plans tonight, honey?
going out? Maybe a party with girls there?
yuck, Mom.
Hey, Dad.
where are you going all dressed up like that?
union meeting about a strike.
I can't believe they sold the lumber yard to this Holden & Charles, knowing full well that's the only thing keeping this town alive.
I'm going to get put out of work by these assholes.
[Mom] Darryl. - Hey, Dad,
mom wants me to go to a party with girls there.
can you say gross?
I can say disappointed.
gross.
that little girl's back.
what?
she's been coming by all afternoon.
something about a mystery.
a client.
I wish we had a girl.
Hi. Are you the Mystery Team?
the original and best.
I'm Brianna. I have a mystery for you to solve.
here's a dime.
what can we do for you, ma'am?
just fill out this form real quick.
mark the box by the appropriate mystery.
there's lost kitten, hopscotch dispute, sack lunch fraud.
kids your age are our best customers and also guilty of nearly 100% of the cases we solve.
whatever it is, we can handle it.
can you find out who killed my parents?
they got killed last night.
they took Mommy's ring.
it was really old and special because it was Grandma's.
I'm going to go have a word with my two partners.
is that okay?
okay.
Oh, my geez.
I know.
who's going to tell her we can't help her?
what? What are you talking about?
this is exactly what we wanted... a real case.
this isn't a real case, okay?
this is just some sad little kid.
and besides, the Mystery Team doesn't solve murders.
are you kidding?
what does it say on our sign?
we'll also work for fruit roll-ups.
the other sign.
no case too hard, no case too tough.
but that's not...
what's harder and tougher than a murder?
then people will know we're legitimate.
what are we going to do?
just walk into the police station and tell them we're taking the case?
they'll just laugh at us.
that's why we won't tell the police.
Oh, no. Now you're starting to sound like Dad.
you guys are worse than the principal.
everyone's saying that we can't do this.
well, I say we can.
let's show them that we're detectives...
grown-up detectives solving grown-up mysteries.
mystery Team?
mystery Team.
mystery Team.
Brianna!
Jesus, Brianna.
I told you not to wander away from me like that.
I've been looking for you for, like, 20 minutes.
I'm sorry. Can we help you?
I'm sorry if she bothered you.
you cannot go off the street like that, okay?
this is my sister Kelly.
that's enough.
I'm sorry about what happened.
if you need a place to stay, we keep an extra sleeping bad under the stand in case of emergencies.
we're staying with a work friend of my dad's until Child Services figures out what to do with us.
Yeah, it's... probably better.
it's a big house on the hill.
come on.
Actually...we'd like to take a statement.
what?
I'm sorry. We're the Mystery Team.
we solve mysteries, and your sister hired us to find out who...killed.
listen, she's 8 years old.
she thinks Mommy and Daddy are on a long vacation in heaven, okay?
so just let it go.
but we can help. We're real detectives.
no, thanks.
we can get your ring back.
baby, you have to forget about the ring, okay?
it's special. - It's not special.
the only thing I'm worried about right now is you.
we can get your ring back.
I promise.
big house up on a hill.
maybe they're staying at that place up on Cedar Street?
Yeah, it's great.
I mean, it's not great that her parents died.
it's great for the case that she lives so close and that she sleeps...right there.
okay. Let's show them what the old Mystery Team can do.
the old Mystery Team never solved a murder.
what about the time that frog got run over?
that's not the same thing.
Yes, it is.
a crime is a crime, from the tiniest marble that rolls down a storm drain to an autographed baseball that rolls down a storm drain.
now who's doing this?
because I'm in.
I'm in.
to the storm drain.
no, Charlie. - No.
okay.
now remember, this is murder, so we're looking at older suspects...
grades 4 through 6...
kids who have been lost in the system.
maybe it's Jimmy Miller.
he's been hot ever since the "two milks at lunch" incident.
my money's on Joey Cartwright.
he's got nothing to lose.
wrote "penis" on his arm in permanent ink.
fellas, I think we found our guy.
he's a little out of our age range, but in all of Oakdale, there's only one fiend dastardly enough for murder.
old Man McGinty.
he still live in that spooky old house on Sycamore Street?
does water boil at 100 degrees Celsius?
it does.
good.
then he lives there, then.
why'd you do it, McGint...
well, it looks like crankiness runs in the McGinty family.
Yeah. We can definitely rule out Old Man McGinty as a suspect.
Yeah. He couldn't murder anyone.
he's practically a corpse himself.
practically a corpse himself.
I think we're going to have to rule out all the usual suspects.
even Billy Meyers.
what? - I know.
he punched a dog in the face.
but murder is an entirely different game.
Yeah. Besides, he couldn't murder anyone.
he's practically a corpse himself.
Yeah, we got it, Charlie.
okay, okay.
tomorrow we hit the ground running, take this on like real detectives.
are we going to visit the scene of the crime?
better.
clues.
thank you for your cooperation.
the double homicide of Karen and Barton Peters has left the Oakdale Police baffled.
at approximately 5: 45 a. m. the couple was shot fatally in their home at 42 Maple Hill Road.
a vehicle was heard speeding off.
the Chief of Police said in a statement all preliminary signs indicate that this was a robbery attempt.
peters moved to Oakdale with his family one week ago to represent the Holden & Charles Corporation in negotiations regarding the ongoing lumber strike.
this doesn't give us any names.
how are we supposed to find suspects?
want me to go down to the playground?
bust a few heads?
no, no, no, no, no.
we got to do this by the book.
let's get a statement from Brianna.
she might know something.
I'll get it, Mrs. Finney.
the Mystery Team.
can we come in, Brianna?
we have a few questions we'd like to ask.
okay, Brianna, we're going to do something called good cop-bad cop.
it's like a game.
I'm going to pretend to be mean, but it's just part of the game, okay?
wipe that smile off your face. You think this is a game?
l... No.
I'm just pretending, remember?
okay, now Duncan's going to come in, and he's going to be the good cop.
that'll be fun, right? Okay.
my partner.
the guy's an animal, right?
you doing okay? Can I get you anything?
apple juice?
you know, I can make this real easy.
all right, the gloves are coming off.
Brianna?
what the hell are you guys doing?
are these friends of yours, Kelly?
no. Better. We're the Mystery Team.
my name's Jason, the master of disguise.
I'm Duncan, the boy genius.
and I'm Charlie, the strongest kid in town.
what is wrong with you?
sorry. Sorry.
they're my friends.
Oh, boy. Let's clean you up.
honey, get some paper towels.
why are you here?
now just relax, okay?
we were just shaking your sister down...
out. Now.
Hey.
is that your book?
Yeah. Great detective work.
now can you leave?
21st Century Detectives?
this is a book about being a detective.
someone stole that guy's face.
the Somerville Slasher.
they made a really bad movie about him.
I see. You're reopening the case.
no. I used to want to be a forensic pathologist.
that's like a baby doctor, right?
no. It's like a detective, but with science.
neato. Why'd you stop?
I don't know. I grew out of it.
it was stupid.
Hey, following your dreams is never stupid, unless you dream about water and then you pee the bed last Thursday.
what? - For example.
just hold that up there. You should be fine.
Thanks, Mr. Finney.
we should go.
Charlie?
I'm not sure if it's, like, a little kid word or something, but he said he wanted to stick his finger in the pie - to see if it felt like a... - Charlie!
all right, I'll make you a deal.
if we find your ring, then you'll believe that I'm a real detective.
deal?
great.
what do we do now?
if we can't talk to the victims' family, we're going to have to go to the street for information.
time to hit up our best informant.
Jordy. - Duncan.
Jordy.
shut it. It's the Mystery Team!
what is up, you guys?
Hey, Jordy. What's buzzin', cousin?
stayin' cool, fool.
Hey, I got a new gum flavor for you.
it's Watermelon Whirlpool.
Yeah, put it in your mouth.
Oh, thanks. - That's so boss.
it's on me.
neato.
wow, I haven't seen you guys in a while.
you guys used to come in here all the time back in the day.
you guys would solve a crime, and then you would come in here, and I would give you free ice cream.
and we're still doing it.
you guys are still solving crimes, and sure enough, I'm still right here.
we're doing it.
Yeah.
actually, Jordy, we're here to get some info.
Yeah, we're trying to solve a double murder.
Yeah, totally.
would you happen to know of anybody who'd be peeping in the area of 42 Maple Hill Road at around 5: 45 yesterday morning?
Yeah, that would be Sam around that time.
who?
Sam. He's a homeless gentleman.
he's always walking around.
comes in here every morning and gets a pack of smokes.
definitely a hobo.
they're constantly smoking to keep their lungs sharp for box car jumping.
what?
Oh, it's in this book I read.
Sully the Wandering Tramp.
it's a gritty and honest portrayal of the complexities of hobo society.
neato. Where can we find this Sam?
check behind the copy center, where they make the copies.
Thanks, Jordy.
no prob, Bob.
Hey, Jason.
paying you in advance, buddy.
ice cream!
ice cream. - Ice cream.
Thanks, Jordy. - You got it.
we're back!
okay. Now, if you have any trouble, we're right around the corner.
if they're grumpy, just cut a bean in half and offer to share it with them.
here. Don't forget your bindle.
it has your hobo treasures in it.
you mean trash? - Charlie, respect their culture.
all right. I'm going in.
well, don't just stand there.
back me up on the brown jug.
Hey. What do you want?
I'm looking for Sam.
I'm Sam.
well, I'm hoping to swap stories with you, my friend.
you didn't see or find anything over at 42 Maple Hill Road the other morn.
I saw a van speed away.
some stuff flew out.
bully. We'II, I'd like to take a gander at your haul, if you don't mind.
20 bucks.
all right. Hobo dollars?
real dollars.
you sure?
I got buttons.
you guys owe me 20 bucks.
Oh, man, this is my lunch money.
dad's going to ask for it later.
what kind of clues did we get?
it's pretty hard to call these clues.
two bottle caps.
maybe the perpetrator likes to drink pop.
the Soda Pop Strangler. Sounds good to me.
they weren't strangled.
moving on, then.
a can of bug spray.
maybe the murderer was their exterminator.
the exterminator. He's already in your house.
you trust him. Your kids love him.
and by that point...
what else do we have?
a Fun Lanes card, and it's been vandalized.
let's take this back to the lab and cross-reference it with the doodle archives.
right. Like we have five hours to spare.
I know Fun Lanes. It's a bowling alley.
you swipe your card, and they keep track of your scores.
are you saying this would have a name on it?
Yeah.
let's go to Fun Lanes.
hold on. We should thank the hobo so he doesn't put a curse on us.
good night, sweet hobo.
may your bindle be heavy with treasures but your heart be light with song.
excuse me, sir.
yo.
Ricky Appleman.
great. The fucking Mysterytards.
yo, what's up, fellas? How can I help you?
when did they let you out, Ricky?
what the fuck are you talking about?
september 15, 2007.
the Case of the Silver Screen Sneak.
you tried to see an extra movie for free.
not on our watch.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
that's right.
y'all motherfuckers ratted me out.
you know, I can't go see movies at that theater no more because of y'all. Thanks a lot.
you're welcome, and we're glad you learned your lesson.
now, if you could just scan this card for us.
this one?
you can shove it up your ass.
you know that won't work, Ricky.
you're right. He's right.
listen, I'm sorry, guys.
take the card. Fuck yourselves!
I thought you were about to tell us a secret.
mystery bitch.
that's a dumb-ass haircut.
that computer is the key to our case.
we're going to need a diversion to get that name.
Duncan, you still got your slingshot?
always.
Charlie, get ready to swipe that card.
just make sure you hit him in the left shoulder so he turns to the left.
you sure you can do this?
I'm aiming for the humerus, which is the longest bone in the body above the waist.
I think I'll be okay.
abort.
maybe there's a computer fact in my book that can help us.
here's one.
by the year 2000, the average computer will be as small as your bedroom.
how old is this?
we could get access to the computer if I got a job here.
Ricky could put in a good word for me.
swimming muffin, scuba muffin, s... dive muffin.
muff Diver?
Kelly's ring!
and he's smoking.
he did it.
but we need hard evidence to take back to the crime lab.
Duncan, you still got your spy camera?
always.
fuck!
what the fuck are you doing, man?
what a scoop... local boy bowls.
well, got to go.
fuck this shit.
catch you later, man.
he's leaving. We got to follow him.
I don't know, Jason. According to his shirt, he has no fear.
but we made a promise to Kelly to get that ring.
you made a promise.
on behalf of us, the Mystery Team.
mystery Team?
mystery Team.
mystery Team. - All right.
how are we going to get in?
gentlemen's club.
let me see what I can piece together.
Hello, my good man.
my boyos and I were in the neighborhood, and we thought to treat ourselves to a day of sport with other gentlemen.
heigh-ho. Perhaps there will be bear baiting?
I'm wearing a top hat.
gentlemen.
going to need to see some IDs.
well, of course.
Yes, uh, all right. Usual wallet.
there we go.
made of diamonds, I think. - Yes, yes.
velcro will do. - There we go.
okay.
a library card.
a school ID.
and a folded-up tracing of a hammerhead shark.
you got any money?
me and my colleagues are positively abreast with... currency.
go ahead.
Ah, yes. - Yes. Oh, yes.
I can't wait to bear bait.
I hear the mink is very good here.
Oh, the mink. I love mink.
England.
okay. Remember, act like gentlemen.
hello.
good day, my lady.
my pussy is so wet for you.
pussy.
okay.
suspect in sight.
there's... There's something on your stomach.
it's a C-section scar.
for 20 bucks, I'll let you come on it.
I'll give you 5 if you tell me what that means.
Eric?
Oh, shit. 5-0, 5-0!
Oh, no, no, no!
man, what the fuck I do now?
you didn't do anything.
what are you doing here?
my mom works here.
it's better than shaking your shit on the street.
we're tailing a suspect.
do you know that guy?
Oh, yeah. Dougie.
he's in here all the time.
likes to finger the girls.
Hey, you guys want to get dry fucked?
no, we're okay. - Yeah, we're good.
Hey, Tammy, these are my friends.
show them a good time.
perhaps if we pay her, she'll go away.
they're like pigeons.
suspect is on the move.
excuse me, Miss. I'm sorry.
ma'am, it's been a pleasure.
you guys okay?
Yep.
Yeah, I'm okay.
good.
sorry.
my penis.
I think he's in here.
found him.
no watching. Y'all got to go.
no. See, this is a stakeout, so it's fine. Okay, it's fine.
Charlie, take him out.
I need more time.
run!
this stage is wet! It smells like cold cuts!
sorry.
just keep going. I promise I won't watch.
I'll pay you to watch.
sorry.
thank you.
thank you.
how was it? - You tell me.
did you fuck... Are you kidding me?
get your hand out of my face.
do you want to give me crabs in my eyes?
Where's your ring, man?
what?
the fucking gay-ass ring you were wearing all day today.
where is it? Did you just drop it?
did you lose it somewhere?
no.
let me see it.
no. - Let me see it.
don't worry about it.
you fucking lost that ring inside of that slut's cooch.
just say it so everybody can hear it.
I don't care, all right?
I didn't pay for that shit. Leroy gave it to me.
talking about that guy that used to fuck your mom?
Hey, fuck my mom, all right?
my mom's a slut.
Jason.
Jason, we know where the ring is.
it's in the stripper's vagina.
not anymore.
what?
when she was peeing...
I heard a clink.
Oh, no.
are you sure?
Yes.
well, how are we going to get it out of there?
this looks like a job for the boy genius.
what? No, it doesn't
it's the bouncer.
Charlie, Charlie, the window.
it's too high.
Duncan, you have got to get this ring, okay?
Hurry!
everything is in this toilet!
come on!
Oh, there's something sharp inside of something soft.
come on! He's coming through the door!
got it.
Hurry! - Other hand!
other hand! - Help me, please!
just give me the ring. - He's coming!
Hey, guys.
great. You brought the ring.
Oh, pork chops and applesauce.
you smell like urine. - Dog urine.
I had to sterilize my hand after the strip club.
with dog pee?
Yeah. Did you know a dog's mouth is cleaner than a human's mouth?
therefore, through the transitive property, a dog's urine is just as clean as its saliva, and easier to get.
so you covered your whole hand in dog pee.
no, Jason. I'm not an idiot, okay?
I drank it. But it's worth it, right?
because we got the ring.
we got a ring.
Kelly needs to tell us if it's the right one.
what? You seemed certain it was.
I drank dog pee over this.
that's your choice.
that's not the issue.
for Pete's sake.
before you close the door, we are here to show you that we are mature and legitimate detectives.
what the hell is that smell?
I drank dog urine.
Yeah. You got to leave us alone.
I know, and we will, but before you go...
is this your ring?
where did you find this?
it's a long story.
no, it's not. A stripper peed it into a toilet...
Hey.
shut up.
the Mystery Team keeps its promises.
it's in our charter.
for wherever there is trouble, when a bully bursts your bubble, when a cat's been shaved to stubble...
when... - Thank you.
this means so much.
I feel bad.
it's my pleasure.
the... The urine's kind of backing up on me.
your skin's so soft.
it's like a dolphin's probably is.
what?
Yeah. I'm sorry, guys. These are done.
you can borrow some of my shirts.
did some get in your pants?
no.
are we not just taking off clothes?
you guys want something to drink?
chocolate milk.
so, like, what you guys' deal?
chocolate milk just tastes better than regular milk.
no, I mean, like, the whole dressing up in little kid costumes thing.
what?
the hair, the way you talk.
why do you guys dress like that?
because we're detectives.
Yeah. Who do you dress in dark clothes?
because I used to be Goth, and I don't like shopping.
is Goth like a forensic pathologist?
no. Forensic pathologists study the dead.
Goths dress like the dead and date closeted gay guys named Ember.
so what are you guys going to tell the police?
we...
about that.
we were thinking that we wouldn't do that, and we would just solve it ourselves.
no.
the cops have to follow the rules.
we only have to follow our own rules...
find the clues, solve the case, no comic books in bed.
we need our rest. - We're growing boys.
look, you guys are really sweet, and I really appreciate it, but if you really want to help, you'll go to the police and tell them where you found the ring.
you boys are lucky. My wife just did the laundry.
Oh, okay.
so we're definitely not just taking off clothes, then.
gotcha.
all right.
we promise to hand this case over to professionals.
but if something happens in the meantime...auxiliary walkie-talkie.
now, be careful with this.
it's two good report cards and a summer's allowance, okay?
okay.
it's for the best, Jason.
personally, I'm glad we're going to the police.
we're not going to the police.
what? But you just told Kelly we would.
I told Kelly that we would hand this over to professionals.
what does it say on our sign?
missing kitten purr-fessionals.
Oh, my God, I just got that.
we're keeping evidence from the police, okay?
we could go to jail for that.
you know what happens in jail?
no TV.
I'm finishing this case.
now, are we a team or not?
Jason! There's something fishy down at the sardine factory!
I think it's fish!
not now, Jamie.
are we a team?
Yeah, we're a team.
Yeah. We're a team.
Oh, there he is.
my favorite.
Hey, Jordy.
what do you know about a kid named Dougie?
dirty hair, skater shirts.
Oh, Dougie Sanders.
Yeah, he robbed this place once.
good kid, though.
he had a ring we were looking for.
he said somebody named Leroy gave it to him.
something about his mom.
that guy that used to fuck his mom a whole bunch...
like all the time... Leroy Maddox.
Yeah, he was a senior my second sophomore year.
he is a bad dude.
he's into some serious drugs.
he was on a drug deal once that went sour, then some Bosnians stole his van door.
still drove it around, though.
he don't give a fuck.
where can we find him?
last I heard, he worked at the lumber yard where they make lumber.
perfect. We'll go to the lumber yard, arrest Leroy, and Kelly will think we're real detectives.
who's Kelly?
Jason's lady friend.
nice.
you know, the old...
Yeah, yeah.
right?
poke her in the eye.
that's not what I meant.
how could you get that from that?
quite the ladies' man.
you, though.
no.
you remind me a little of me.
you know what I'm going to call you from now on?
little Me!
just came up with that right now.
but that's what I'm going to call you forever.
from now on, that'll be, like, our little thing, like you're, like, a little version of me.
I carry you around like... like in a papoose.
it would be amazing.
that's great, Jordy.
that's tops, that's tops.
okay. Let's go to the lumber yard, find this Leroy guy.
mystery Team?
mystery Team.
mystery Team.
Hey.
just paying you in advance, buddy.
one ice cream is enough for one day, right?
paying you in advance, buddy.
okay. Bye, Jordy. - Bye.
Bye.
wood.
nature's metal.
I brought some more wood to the wood place because I work here.
everything go smoothly?
Yes, I established credibility.
honestly, this is breaking and entering, okay?
it's illegal.
but it's for justice, so it's legal again.
okay, look for anything with Leroy's name on it.
what the hell are you doing in my office?
we could ask you the same question, Greg.
no, you can't. It's my office.
Yeah, well...
wait.
you're the kid from the strip club, right?
and you're the guy who puts milk in his butt.
Hey, boss, how was lunch?
it was good.
so...this is blackmail.
what else do you know?
lots. Duncan?
the capital of India is New Delhi.
hummingbirds can flap their wings 78 times a second.
fist, heart... same size. - Stop.
what department does Leroy Maddox work in?
we want to have a little chat.
he doesn't work here. He never did.
but we have information that says otherwise.
no one by that name has ever worked here, okay?
now get out of my office before I call the police.
but... - Get out!
I guess Jordy heard wrong.
did you see his face when we said Leroy's name?
it flipped faster than a Sunday morning pancake.
something's up.
nothing's up, okay?
we just broke into a man's office.
what are you doing?
Leroy's in that picture.
he was lying to us.
Leroy did work here.
why would he lie?
because they're in cahoots.
my dad said Holden & Charles is buying the lumber yard and getting rid of the union workers.
and Kelly's dad was a lawyer for Holden & Charles.
so Greg has Leroy kill Kelly's dad.
and then he covers his tracks by pretending that Leroy never worked at the lumber yard.
and this is the lumber yard.
right?
Hey, what are you doing?
who the hell's going to pay for this?
me. Leroy Maddox.
Yeah. I work here.
just... Just send me a bill.
actually, what is the address that you have for me in your computer?
because I'm planning on moving to Guam.
188 Rock Ridge Road?
just send the bill there.
I thought you said you were moving to Guam.
sir, please stay out of my affairs.
this must be it.
all right. Our best bet to infiltrate this place is as high school students trying to buy drugs.
we are high school students.
I know, but we need to make Leroy think we're high school students and not the weirdoes we go to school with.
real high school students.
what you want?
Hi. We'd like to buy some cocaine.
got money?
of course. We're high school students.
we've bought cocaine before.
get the fuck in here.
that's my girl Destiny.
Hey.
don't suck their dicks.
you guys cops?
Nope. Just regular high school students looking to buy some cocaine on a Saturday night.
good.
it's going to be 200 for an 8-ball.
do we need eight?
you know, let's treat ourselves.
you're right.
let's get eight balls.
Yeah. Looks like we've got a long night of cocaine ahead of us.
now, do we have to sign something?
because l...
chill here.
I'll be right back.
don't suck their dicks.
you want me to suck your dicks?
no, ma'am. - That's okay.
thank you, though. - Thank you.
I'm going to go...to the bathroom.
Yeah, that 50 grand you put in my account?
I'm thinking now it ought to be a hundred.
Yeah, well, whether you wanted them dead or not, they are.
and you take a fucking chill pill.
man, I told you we didn't see the fucking papers.
papers.
and if I'm really drunk,
I won't even tell them that I'm having an outbreak.
now you share something.
destiny, could you tell Leroy that I had to go?
something came up.
what's going on?
he said something about papers over at Kelly's house.
I got to go over and check them out.
stall him. - Stall him? Are you crazy?
Thanks, man. You're a pal.
I'm really close to solving this one.
he definitely killed them.
okay. Bye.
fuck!
Motherfuck!
he thinks I'm asking.
I ain't fucking asking.
Where's the other one?
that guy? We didn't know that guy.
we thought you knew that guy, so we should probably just go, then.
you guys trying to fuck me?
what?
he said do you guys want to fuck me?
no, that ain't what I said.
are you or are you not trying to fuck me?
we aren't trying to F anyone.
look, this is a bad time to buy cocaine anyway.
I mean, with the market how it is, it is better to rent cocaine.
till your friend comes back, you guys ain't going anywhere.
Oh, fuck!
Kelly?
what are you doing here?
getting Brianna's teddy bear. Oh, my fucking face.
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
no, I'm not.
whoa, Nelly! I really got you good.
what?
wait a minute. Why are you here?
well, there was some major progress in the case, so...
Jason, I swear to God, I told you...
I know. You told us to stop.
and that's fine because you don't know that you're wrong.
but we got a really good lead that something very important is in this house.
there's nothing here, okay?
the police took everything important to the case.
they're professionals.
okay, did your dad ever say anything strange about the union?
no. He did what he always did.
Holden & Charles, they would have a problem, we'd move, and we wouldn't leave until it was fixed.
okay, okay. I'll be more specific.
did your dad have any...papers?
Where's your buddy?
l... I don't know.
but, luckily for all of us,
I brought Travel Scrabble.
