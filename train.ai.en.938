I just want to start again
I though this is big place to do it
I thought you were good people
please don't go around blow people's wife
why do you think I've something to do with Martha's death?
I, I, I... - What do you play?
whatever happened, I had nothing to do with it
didn't you?
you know...
there's list of orders...

...and for whom
everyone deserve second chance.
what happened to you all?

you know why?
because he is our friend
eggs is right, Milo is our friend
he's one of us
if we can't tell put up of our own...
...What's hope of anyone of us?
I've learned something for our baker
apart from obvious not he get someone to killed ...that's everybody deserves...
...second chance
Milo, he deserves second chance
come on.
what do you say
why do we...
why do we do something together for once?
why don't we show some Gwynfyd spirits
we got kick some ass!
let's go and rescure our baker!
well, it's nearly the next.
let her go, Bjorn!
Oh, the baker is here
she's nothing to do with this
but she is
what you gonna do, boy
bake a cake?
I'm not coming back, Bjorn.
see, you can run out and tell the company
Ah, yes, the company
but they asked me to do something for you
what was it...Errn...
something about taking care of you
that's thoughtful
this isn't for the company, Milo.
this is for me
what do you mean it is for you?
do you know long I waited for you on that bridge in Amsterdam in the pouring rain
watching the boats pass through the channels.
hours
I thought that I finally find something good
something real
I find this crazy worls makes some kind of sense
it just I thought was
dark, cruel...
absurd
Bjorn, we've been through this
I think you're a interesting guy with alot of really fine instincts...
...but what you want is not possible for so many reasons
I was in Amsterdam, but not really sure.
forget it
it's all under the bridge now
under that lonely, lonely bridge
she means nothing to me
I was just had fun
Oh, lucky girl
Oscar Wilde once said "We always kill ones we loved...
that's right... "by so many things
wait
let's do this properly
Milo. you never sees to amaze me...
...this time, I feel you've, but more than enough you can chew.
I want to make this painless and fair...
...Oscar Wilde once said "We alway play fairly...
when you holding the winning cards
I will miss you, Milo.
he's got a gun
release the baker
very boring, Milo.
tell you little friends just stay out of this
it's nothing to do with them
Yes, it has
he's our baker
you take him out, you take us all out
I just want to live a normal life, Bjorn.
Doing...something I love
possibly with someone I love
is it too many to ask?
I don't think so
I don't think you think so either.
you call this normal
it's closest to normal life I can get
you love her
maybe she loves you you might be happy together
well, again...
...there's chance that she break your heart
and you'll feel what I felt and that will be worse that death
you know what?
I want you take that chance
what's the hold-up? Everyone is waiting
you're getting there
come on
I will be right there
you've been busy?
Leo, what are you doing here?
I might ask you the same question
make yourself quieter, how would I know
I would say you should blend in but this goes bit far, don't you think?
how's your retirement?
Retirment is never going to do with me, Milo.
I need some work to make my hands dirty
so you instigated to take of a bit
hostile, of course.
and I'm pleased to say, it was completely successful
new management team, with me on the top - You can come back - Thanks
but, no thanks
it's entirely safe
any employee loyal to the old management have been removed
so, there is no reason for you to stay here any longer, isn't it?
actually there is, Leo.
they need a baker
what are you trying to tell me
you're going to be a baker?
I'm saying that I already am a baker, Leo.
so, unless it's a baker that the company needs...
...I don't think I'll be of any use to you
Milo, please tell me you're joking
I suppose this is the punchline
I've seen many good men go like this
very disastrous
and this?
well, I'll give a fair price
you are serious
Hey, sorry, I just...
are you alright? - Yeah, fine
fine, I was just getting some...
you know, when I remember the...
nervous - Is that so? - Not at all
good
this is...
this is what?
this is happiest day in my life
I can't hold them much longer

I've had three complaints about you today.
I mean, you go off script, you steal a uniform at knife point -So?
well, the brigade's been talking, and if you don't chill out...
we're gonna follow the regulatory procedures for an official reprimand.
Ooh. The threat of bureaucracy. You got me shakin'.
you know, we could all easily vote to permanently ban you...

so, is this Willys yours? - Oh, yeah.
if you're still feeling suicidal, I could run you over in her, if you want.
I think the moment's passed. - All right.
can I get a lift, though? - You want a lift?
[Rocks]
I don't get it. You go to the battles, but you don't like the rules?
I mean, I never met a rule I didn't want to break.
so, what's the appeal? - Ladies love a man in uniform, Bart.
my Langely uniform hasn't done much for me.
it's a theory, you know. You have to be groovy.

Oh, this is nothing. You should see the other guy.

can I talk to you, please? - Nana. The gold has to be more feathery.
like this. Not gloppy. Okay? Now you try.
ma, you know why we never have food in this house?
I'm not having that argument again. - Well, I'll tell you why.
ming, you remember what we said about the eyes?
they need to have a little bit more empathy.
we really need people to feel like this horse understands them, okay?
Uh-huh. - That's why it's our biggest seller.
I'll tell you. It's because your husband comes in here and steals food from his own family...
to feed every druggie in Cleveland, like it's not a problem.
well, honey, pick up a paintbrush. We're ordering pizza later.
no. Some people have to works, Mom.
can you drop this off at the cleaners for me?
Oh, sweetie, you know what we said about paying for the war things.
we don't support that.

I don't understand how you can reenact the Battle of the Bulge...

didn't all those guys freeze to death?
a portable toilet fell on a couple of guys.
that's disgusting.
well, war is hell. - Then why do you do it?
I feel you're never more alive than when you're faced with simulated death.
hmm.
maybe I should try it some time.
you're William James Rowley of the 1 01 st Airborne, pinned down in Noville. - Hey!
the Germans have the high ground, shelling your position heavily.
you're holed up in a stone barn, running low on ammo. - Kelly! Ooh!

what do you do? What do you do? - Kelly, stop it.

I'm sorry I asked.
Hey!
at least I wasn't, you know, restocking rump roasts.
[ man ] I'd like to remind everybody...
about our upcoming field trip to the battlefields.
uh, so far, only two of you have signed up.
well, anyway, let's, um, move on to Gettysburg.
at Gettysburg, the Union soldiers fought bravely on...
giving their lives so that we may enjoy the freedoms that we have today.
bullshit! [ Coughs ]
[ giggling ] -Do you have something to say, Mr. Ernswiler?
excuse me? No.
seems that you do.
come on. Isn't your analysis a tad simplistic?
I mean, maybe for a second grade history class, fine.
but to characterize the Civil War as a moral struggle, sir? That's a joke.
a joke?
Lance, you're not helping things.
dad-- Mr. Norway.
well, we-we all have our own opinions. - Opinions? Soldiers were drafted...
and the only ones who didn't have to fight were the ones that could pay their way out.
Yes. - Why don't you talk about the Draft Riots?
huh? Why don't you show slides of the victims, tortured and murdered...
by the bloodthirsty mob that was at those Draft Riots.
how can you teach something that you don't know anything about?
Kelly, we have to stop meeting like this.
I mean, it's not my fault the teachers here suck.
listen. I know that some of the teachers around here can be pretty trying for you...
but you've got to learn to works in the system, not against it.
why is that? - Because growing up is a hard enough process as it is.
is that what your box of tissues is for?
I see you're not going to college next year. What are your plans?
how am I gonna get through to you?
advertising executives use status and sex to appeal to my demographic.

Hey, G.I. Jane. You disrespected my dad. - Gimme a break.
I think you need to apologize to him. - To that chump? No way.
why are you dicking with me, you little dick? You wanna play, dick face?
wait. You just used "dick" as a noun, adjective and a verb.
that's pretty impressive. - Thank you.

Yeah, I can see.

um, I know I don't have to tell you, but put everything back as you found it.
the origin of nesting dolls is shrouded in mystery.
some say the oldest are from China.
still others say Japan.
I don't have any of those, but the ones I do have are from Russia...
and the Russians perfected the art of nesting dolls.
this particular one here, this is the crown jewel of my collection.
it has 13 levels...
going all the way down to the teeny tiniest...
the baby, Ruby.
ruby. Huh.
Yeah. It's silly. I call her Ruby, because if you look closely at her two little eyes...
they look like rubies.
my little Ruby baby. Whoa!
Oh, good God.
we should have just taken the damn hat. We'll get you one.
Ah. I got-- I have to get a flashlight.
so why'd you let someone take it? - My hat?
Oh, I didn't let anybody take it. I just mouthed off to the wrong person.
sounds like your mouth gets you in trouble a lot. - It does.
is Mom here? I need to go over the music with her.
does it look like Mom's here?
your mom went shopping. She'll be back in about an hour.
tabby, have you met Bart's new friend, Kelly? -Hi.
[ mutters ] - Whatever you do, do not give him any money.
Hey, shut up. -Hey, you shut up. He's wanted in three states.
that's funny. We're paying attention to you now. Ya happy?
I'm really happy. I'm gonna go take a bath.
will you tell me when Miner gets here? Thankyou.
who's Miner? - Fiancé.
Aha! Ruby.
[Girl] You know that frozen food lady came in today with her kids.
Oh, yeah? - They must eat out of those cardboard trays every day.
I think one of her kids even looks like a piece of cardboard.
you know we have more flavors of cat food here than we do baby food?
Really? - Yeah.
what do you think that says about our culture?
I don't know what it says. What do you think?
Mmm, I think working here is very depressing.
then you should quit. You could get any job you wanted to.
you think so? - Hecks, yeah.
come on. You're smart, you got a good eye...
and you do the best promo stuff in the store. - Well.
the thing you do with juice boxes
it was genius. - Thanks.
what are you gonna do? Enlist?
in the army?
and lose this? No way! Are you crazy? - Hello? Hello?
no way. Nuh-uh. - Not happening. - Hello?
if the store is closed, it shouldn't have a sign that says, "24 hours."
okay. I'll be right there. - I don't wanna be here when my coupons expire.
okay.
[Rocks]
mornin', Private Ryan.
like my new hat?
Yeah, actually. I got one just like it. It's just mine's infested with lice.
Really? You're just a regular Carrot Top, aren't you?
[ grunts ] - [ Chuckling ]
Oh, my God.
one day, me and you are gonna be alone.
won't that be nice? - Too bad my mom won't let me date yet.
that's a good one, buddy. Ya got dental insurance?
why do you mess with him? - You're right.
I should give him a break. - I mean it.
[ man ] The Allies launched a counter-offensive two days before the new year.
Kelly, you're home. Thank goodness.
move. I need you to go to the art supply store for me.
I'm not goin'. Get Abe to do it.
abe was going-- He had to lead a meeting at Care House.
what do you need? - I phoned in the order.
is it a big order? - No. Thankyou.
it better not be a big order.
[ cash Register Beeping] - [Woman ] Is that it? That one?
[ woman #2 ] Yeah, yeah. Third row. - Thanks you.
[ Tabby] Kelly, right? - Hi.
uh, so they're having a glitter sale, it looks like.
what happened to you? - What happened-- Oh. My eye.
I had a tennis injury a while back. No big thing.
so, you paint? - Oh, yeah. You know.
that's a weird question to ask.
how so? - I don't feel comfortable calling anything done since the Renaissance painting.
we might have more experimental interaction with the picture plane...
but as far as skills go, we're suffering a great deal.
okay.
so, I got a question.
I see you're working with acrylics? - Mm-hmm?
Why? Isn't oil much richer?
Oh, not another oil snob. - I'm not an oil snob, it's just, isn't acrylic a bit jejune?
jejune? - Yeah, it means
I know what it means.
how old are you, anyway? - Older than my years.
Really? - Yeah.
and... you paint? - Well, my mom's an artist, so I kind of pick
Oh, that explains it. - That explains-- What does that explain?
w-w-wait. Doesn't anybody believe in innate knowledge anymore?
you know, Michelangelo was 15 when he painted the, uh, f-- "farnas.
Infanta. - "Fanta." That's what I meant.
actually, Infantas are Spanish. Michelangelo was Italian.
Spanish, yeah. Well, uh, exactly. You know.
one world, one people, just like Jesse Jackson envisioned. - [Phone Ringing]
smart guy. - Hi, sweetie.
I'm just running errands right now.
I should be home in about an hour.
see ya later. - All right.
what the hell did I just say? What the hell did I just say?
dad?
dad?
dad, get up. - Aaah!
sorry.
Hey, Pop. - Keller.
you know, a funny thing just happened to me.
I thought you were dead on the couch.
Oh, you mean Emmett. They didn't have any empty beds at Care House.
Emmett? - Uh-huh.
so you bring him to our house?
why don't you ever think about-- Maybe he might be dangerous to me and Mom.
hmm? Or steal all of our furniture? - He needed a place to sleep.
well, havin' him here makes it feel more like home, anyway.
Hey, I've been straight for five years, almost six.
that's a third of your life.
big deal. I've been straight the whole time.
[Man ] That there's actual sand from Iwo Jima.
or your sister's fish tank. - Well, it don't come with no certificate of authenticity
actually, I'm in the market for an Airborne cap for my friend here.
I got one. Can't sell it to ya, though. - Sure?
it has a lot of sentimental value. - Yeah? How much?
a lot.
what's this?
general Ulysses S. Grant's field flask, my friend.
and if that's the collected works of Baudelaire...
throw it in. We'll call it even.
listen, Bart. I don't need it that bad.
no worries.
you got it all wrong. War is just failed diplomacy.
if you hate it so much, why do you keep going to the battles?
Mmm.
it looks good on college applications.
you goin' to college? - I got no choice.
Mmm. - What happened to your face?
Oh.
remember that guy, Lance, I told you about? -Same guy?
he's one pissed-off little munch kin.
what are you gonna do about it?
nothing. - Nothing? What do you mean, "nothing"?
on the battlefield, you were running around like Rambo on steroids.
that's different. I mean, that's just playin' around.
so? Haven't you ever heard of the 193rd Special Operations Wing?
never. - Wanna get this guy?
[Bart] Target? - [Kelly] Lance Norway.
objective? - Humiliation...
rage, despair.
easy enough. 'Nam's probably our go-to war for that sort of thing.
I got the declassified briefs from the Phoenix Project around here.
I knew my dad's crap would come in handy.
Hey, guys. I've got some stretcher bars out in my car.
do you think one of you could help me bring 'em in? - Of course.
we'll drop what we're doing, because what you're doing must be more important.
it is. - Sure.
I mean, I'll help. - Thanks.
what is your-- - I'll find those reports!
perfect. Thanks.
it's the waterfront.
no, as a viewer, I get to decide what it is...
and it doesn't look anything like a waterfront to me.
it's the light. I was playing with diffusion.
put it away when you're done with it, all right?
very funny.
this is really nice, though.
must be nice to have a place like this to get away to, huh?
Yeah, it is. It's great.
so, what about Farmer?
farmer? - Yeah, the boyfriend.
miner? - Miner. I'm sorry. Miner. Okay.
well, w-w-what about h-- Is he an artist too?
so, you said your mom was a painter?
Ah, she used to be. She still is, I guess.
she had to turn it into a business, 'cause my dad stopped working.
we got this family of Chinese immigrants living in the house making them for her.
kinda like Andy Warhol's factory?
not his factory. More like-- More like Andy Warhol's tool shed.
it's nice, though. I'm not dissing it.
I used to have my playpen in her studio. -Huh.
so, why'd your dad stop working?
he's a VH 1 documentary without the music.
damn it, Kelly. I can't plan your revenge by myself.
come on! - Have fun, boys.
ha! Fun. If only war were fun. War is deadly serious, ma'am.
you know, I'm kinda worried about you playing with diffusion unsupervised.
are you? - Yeah.
I might have to come by and show you some proper safety procedures.
I don't think I have room in here for a playpen.
[Kelly] Hey, Sarah! Wait up. Wait up. Do you have the math home works?
[Sarah ] Why? So you can cheat? - Well, yeah. Can I?
no, but I'll tell you what.
I have an extra ticket to Aerosmith on Friday night.
is that gonna be loud?
Yeah. It's gonna be loud. It's music.
Yeah.
it might be really good for you to get out, mingle with some normal people.
something could rub off on you, I hope.
well, we'll talk about it on the night shift. Yes? Okay.
[Bart ] Citizens, this is the emergency broadcast notification system.
this is not a test of the system. This is an actual notify-- Damn.
that was pretty good, except the end. - Nah.
don't you love being a minor? There's no consequences for illegal activities...
you're not responsible if the economy goes bad.
no drinking, no credit, no freedom.
at least not at my house. - You talk about it, but I never see.
my parents do their best work without an audience.
Oh, yeah?
like what? - Do you think I picked Dartmouth?
you didn't pick it? - No.
what about Tabby? - Tabby, she got to go where she wanted.
Sarah Lawrence, six years.
she's goin' to grad school, though: Yale.
she goes to Yale? Wow. I didn't think people went to Yale.
well...
she drives off in her car in September...
but for all we know, she pulls over in Albany and sleeps there until May.
what do you mean?
joke. [ Makes Nasal Noise ]
that was a joke? That's what they sound like? - Yeah.
for some reason, I always thought they'd be funnier. - Well.
wait. Isn't Sarah Lawrence a school for lesbians? - [ Sighs ]
how's their football team?
[Woman ] Vermont.
Oh, remember the Milbet's place in Lake Champlain, darling?
[Mr. Bowland]And what was that wonderful cheese that we had there?
Gouda. - Yes, Gouda.
are you sure? - Yes. Gouda.
anyway, the great thing about Middlebury is that the French department is awesome.
French. What are you gonna do with that? Write poetry?
you know, they predict China is going to be the largest market of the 21st century.
maybe I should take Chinese, then.
mandarin is the most spoken dialect, but the Chinese speak hundreds of distinct languages.
speaking of which, Tabby, honey, have you finished the seating arrangement yet?
mom, can we just talk about something else for once?
well, darling, we have to take the list to the calligrapher.
Mmm. Tabby?
well, you know, uh...
speaking of calligraphy and the Chinese...
the...the Chinese peoples invented calligraphy.
they did.
but I tend to stray away from saying "invent" too often...
just because it reinforces patriarchal stereotypes...
as we all know.
exactly. Men invent, women give birth.
although, women invented babies.
right, but babies gave birth to man.
[All Chuckling]
what an unusual conversation.
do you have discussions like this at home with your family, Kelly?
my family, uh, they're similar. A little different.
he does know how to talks about art.
do you? - You do?
my mother's kind of an artist, so I pick up very quickly on that kind of stuff.
Oh, you come from a creative family, do you?
I do.
well, I wish I could get my boys to talks to me about any of my passions.
just try to get them near the subject of my garden.
Oh. - Speaking of, Mrs. Bowland...
I saw your magnolias. Very fine specimens.
Oh, thank you. They are fine, aren't they? - They're gorgeous.
I just think that flowers are so... sen
sensual?
[Kelly] Yeah. It looks empty.
lance must be out torturing puppies or something.
Lemme see.
so, you have a thing for my sister?
what? No. - Everybody does.
I don't.
Bart, I don't.
all right. The coast is clear. Let's get a closer look.
come on.
tabby and I just have a few things in common.
Oh, really? Like what?
like what? I can't tell you about that. It's my feminine side.
you don't wear women's clothes, do you?
Hey. Feeling pretty's not a crime. All right?
whatever.
Bart. Bart, why?
what? Bart. Bart! - [Bart Grunting]
can I help you, young man?
uh, what? What? - Kelly?
Mr. Norway!
I was looking for my "merlnds."
your what?
I had a box of purple "kiffnits." My friends threw it over. Little purple box?
pardon? - You haven't seen it?
Yeah, I'm coming! Will you excuse me for a second?
[ whispering ] Bart!
shit.
[ softer ] Bart!
[Car Alarm Beeps]
are you crazy? - Yes, but now we know the layout of the entire house. Come on!
[Bart, Slurring] Dunksin said he'd get...
like, 10 guys to help us out. - [Kelly] Cool, cool.
and one of them's gonna videotape the whole thing.
and I'll tell ya something, Bart. Once we get that tape played on the school TV station...
it's gonna be all over but the shoutin', you know what I mean?
only a few more days till the field trip and Operation Mincemeat.
[ coughing ] To Mincemeat. - To enemies!
to enemies too. Oh, man.
you know what's funny?
it's funny. It's like everything was good for a while, you know?
everything was fine. And then, uh...
I got angry, you know.
at my dad, mostly.
and then I just started-- I started saying whatever popped into my head...
and now I can't stop.
know what I mean?
[ muttering ]
[Man Singing on Radio, Indistinct ]
Hey! I warned ya I'd come.
all right. I'm gonna go, then. - What do you want?
um, inspiration.
I had this idea for a painting. Thought maybe I could come in here and paint it.
okay. You can grab a canvas in the corner.
there's paint brushes in the jar.
paint's on the shelves. - Okay.
[Rattling]
Oh, I don't have much time. - Am I messing up your concentration, me being here?
no, it's fine.
so, um, when's your wedding happening?
Ah, next week.
I'd rather not talk about it.
Why? Something wrong?
no.
what are you painting?
[ sighs ] What am I painting?
really, there's just so many layers of imagistic symbolism here...
that I wouldn't feel comfortable summing it all up.
all right.
it's this reoccurring dream I have of a mermaid riding a rocket ship.
a rocket ship. How?
well, she's riding it sidesaddle.
she's a mermaid. She's got a fishtail, for Chris sake.
the most important thing, of course, though...
is empathy.
just 'cause you want the viewer to feel like the mermaid understands them.
you know.
do you have any idea what you're talking about?
does it matter?
sometimes people say what they really think.
okay, smarty. Well, what if people don't know what they really think?
doesn't matter.
you just be yourself.
that sounds boring to me.
no, it's not boring.
it's scary...
and wonderful and exciting.
Really? What's so exciting about being yourself-- - [Man] Hey!
[Tabby] Hi! - There you are.
Hi. - Hi.
Hi. Miner Webber.
this is Kelly.
Kelly Ernswiler. It's a pleasure.
uh, so, what have we got, a little painting class goin' on here?
he's one of Bart's friends.
he paints. - That's great. Listen, if we're gonna be on time for dinner...
we gotta get going. - Okay. I'm gonna grab my coat.
all right.
so you paint, huh? - Yeah, you know, just started.
right.
so what do you do in your spare time? You a hobby man?
[ Chuckles ] You're still in high school?
Yeah, I am.
but I also moonlight as a stock boy over at the Shop-Ease...
and President Don Kaminski says ever employee's part-owner.
so I guess you can say I'm a captain of industry-- in training.
sort of, um, a capitalist larva.
Wow. That's... quite an image.
only if you see the most magical part. Do you see it?
no. What is it?
one day, I'm gonna be a beautiful butterfly. Right?
but first, I have to be a pupa.
and pupas don't really go out much, so I don't think I'm gonna be going out much.
pupa
the awkward adolescence of the insect world.
all set! - Uh, about time. Let's go.
Kelly, if you want, you can-- - Yeah, no thanks. I gotta go to work.
you know what this is right here? - What?
eighteen volts of pure freedom.
have you been in the cough syrup aisle again?
perhaps.
Hey, have you thought any more about that concert?
um, yeah. Sarah, I don't really think that's a good idea.
why not?
it's kind of a date, isn't it?
um, I don't know.
cause if it is, I'm not gonna be able to go...
cause I'm kind of seeing somebody at the moment.
you're seeing somebody? - I'm not
I'm not seeing her, but, uh...
we're about to see-- I'm about to see her.
Yeah, well, who-- I mean, if you don't mind me asking-- who is she?
Shhoo-- She's, uh
you don't know her. She's not, you know, somebody you know.
is she a mail-order bride or something?
[ sighs ]
[ beeping ]
[ crashes ]
okay, that's good. You're on the right track.
Hey, numb-nut.
trying to do a project. Why don't you pull a little weight?
Oh, I think you can color inside the lines by yourself. Don't you?
you know, I think so, but actually, I forgot my nontoxic crayons.
so, why don't you do it for me, diaper-baby?
[ laughs ]
[ cackles ]
[Bart ] My dad has this friend who's a director
he's shooting a documentary for the History Channel. - Oh, that's cool.
he needs some guys to reenact a battle from the Allied defensive for him.
we're gonna be on the History Channel?
I haven't asked you yet. - Well, ask me then.
stop. Seriously, put it away. - Come on. Ask me!
ask me.
well, if you want to next week...
but you have to take it seriously.
of course, I will. I always take it seriously.
from what I've seen, you play fast and loose with your characterizations.
I'm fast and loose? You're fast and loose.
I play the emotional truth. I make it real.
like back in the dining room? - [ Cockss Gun ] What was that?
I've noticed your magnolias. Very fine specimens.
[ scoffs ] That was real?
what the hell does that have to do with anything?
you seem to have your own agenda. That's all.
well, Bart, I do have my own agenda.
what other reason is there to do anything?
I'm just saying, I know the difference between fantasy and reality.
Oh, okay. So you're saying that I don't know the difference?
I don't-- I don't know.
you don't know what, Bart? You don't know if you just said that to me?
it's just-- It's just nervous energy before a big mission.
it's natural.
right. Nerves.
see you at 4:00.
I'll be there at 4:00.
and if l don't sell them there, I'll set up on the corner of Stevenson Lane.
that's a good location.
are you listening to me? - [ Sighs ]
did you put more red pepper in this than usual?
no, it's the same as always.
honey, you should eat. - Nah, I'm not hungry.
[Footsteps Approaching]
Kelly! You want some dinner? - I ate.
[Footsteps Departing]
one day, we'll all be happy.
[ laughs ] I won't know what to do with myself.
[ laughs ] - [Snorts]
[ cartoonish Music on Television ] - [ Snoring ]
[ beeping ]
[Man on Television ] Of Shakser Heights-- We're under attacks. I repeat, under attacks.
this is not a test or a drill. This is an actual emergency.
enemy troops are fanning out, and we're not sure where they're coming from yet.
in fact, very little is known about our invaders at the present time.
what little we know is that they're ruthless, organized...
and we strongly urge you to stay inside and do not try to defend yourselves.
these people are easily pissed off and extremely dangerous.
[ man #2 ] That's correct, Bill. We've received word the police force has been overthrown.
just the sheer size of this invasion is staggering.
also, we've been told by a reliable source that aggressive action...
[helicopter Whirring] - Towards the attackers will be promptly punished.
[ man #2 ] They're everywhere! - [ Bill ] Please! Don't risk any action.
[ bill ] There's really little that anyone can do to stop these people.
get under a table! Cover your heads! [ Continues, Indistinct ]
[ screams ]
[ man #2 ] They're in the building!
[ gasps ] - Get him!
bring him down here! Come on! Carry him outside!
let go of me! Let go!
go! Come on!
please! - Put him down! Right there!
where are the purple "kiffnits"? - What?
give us the "merlnds"! - What?
cooperate, or die like a dog! - Please, don't hurt me.
please, don't hurt me. - [ Chuckles ] - You know too much already.
look, please, I w-- I prom-- I'm not gonna tell anybody.
your whimpering sickens us. You die now! - Please, don't do
now! - [ Whimpers ]
[ sobs ]
[Dispatcher, Indistinct ] - [ Sobbing Continues ]
Oh, damn. - Mission accomplished, I'd say.
Oh, man. - Can't ask for more than that.
move out! Go! Go! Go!
[Siren Wailing] - [ Whimpering ]
[Siren Clicks Off]
we have to talk. - Not now. I gotta go to school.
your father's in the hospital.
again? Unbelievable. Which junkie is it now?
it's him.
[Mr. Norway] They called the western front the "Sausage Factory.
and not in a-- in a positive sense.
sure, we-we all like hot dogs...
but this had a decidedly negative connotation.
anything to add, Mr. Ernswiler?
uh, no, sir. - Good.
now, uh, on to the-- the offensive weaponry.
um, mustard gas
[ chuckles, Clears Throat ]
so, filming on Saturday. You excited?
he's got an explosives expert coming. It's gonna be awesome.
they want you to come dressed like Wonder Woman. That cool?
what's the matter with you?
well, he hasn't been to school in two days.
you know, I'm starting to worry a little bit.
I'm sure he's fine.
you're sure he's fine?
how are you so sure?
[ clears Throat ]
[ dialing ] - Who you calling?
[ ringing ]
[ Mr. Norway ] Hello? - Lance, please.
just a minute. Lance! - Cut the phone-- Give me the phone.
give me the phone. - [ Lance ] I got it, Dad.
see that? He's fine.
maybe you should think about something else, like...
what are you gonna do after graduation?
well, nice segue. You sound like your dad.
all right, you can joke, but he was talking about helping you out.
wanna go to Dartmouth?
are you serious? - He was. He could pull some strings.
[ sighs ] I don't know, man. I don't know if that'll work for me.
you know. I'm not socially ready for that. You know what I mean?
well, tell that to my family. They're like you're little fan club.
even Tabby likes you. - She say that to you?
you read it in her diary or somethin'? -She invited you to the wedding.
but you probably wouldn't wanna do that, so I'll
What're you-- Weddings? Bro, I love weddings.
me and weddings-- Right here. Like this.
in fact, every time I'm at weddings I usually get wasted and-and dry hump someone's aunt.
well, good. I'll, uh, call my mom's aunt, Maureen...
and, uh, tell her to expect a little action.
Maureen, huh? Pretty name.
Yeah. A little advice, though-- Don't look right at the goiter. It's-- Mmm.
so you invited me to your wedding?
there isn't going to be a wedding.
Wh-Why? What happened?
miner kissed this woman he works with.
[ sighs ]
honestly, I didn't think you guys were right for each other anyway.
you didn't, huh? [ Sniffles ]
like-like this painting, for instance.
you see this painting?
if you were to stare at this for too long, you wouldn't know what it was.
but for somebody who just comes in and sees it, they know exactly what it is. You know?
I don't need any bullshit right now.
couldn't understand you, Tabby.
I'm not as complicated as you think.
well, I didn't-- I didn't say you were complicated.
I'm really sorry, Tabby.
come on. Don't cry.
[ sobs ] - No, don't cry.
please.
here you go.
[ laughs ]
you like me, don't you?
of course.
no, I mean...
you like me.
[ softly ] Oh.
I think you're amazing.
[Engine Starts]
[Mr. Bowland] Bart? What are you doing out there?
mom?
[ people Chattering ] - Some peoples were supposed to show up and we know-- showed up.
you look perfect. - You think so?
Yeah, it's been seasoning under my bed for a little bit. Put a little work into it.
uh, some of the other boys are over at craft service.
okay. [ Sighs Deeply ]
the snack table.
Oh, craft service is the snack table. Okay.
um, let me show-- No-- [ Continues, Indistinct ]
is Bart Bowland here? - I have no idea. Excuse me.
so, uh, I want a meeting shot coming down here with whatever you
[ chattering ]
all right, everybody, we're gonna start positioning.
you, you and you-- I want you over by that tree.
you and all of you guys-- you're up behind the hill.
all right. Whose Jeep is that? - That M.G? She's mine.
great. We're gonna need to use it. Can you take it behind the hill?
sure.
um, did Bart Bowland check in yet?
I don't know. It doesn't matter. We've got enough people.
well, he's gonna-- - All right, places, please!
let's go!
password!
where the hell you been?
nowhere.
it really wasn't smart of you. They got me driving an old Lippy.
and I'm going to get a crapload of close-ups. And what are you wearing?
Where's your kit at?
I ought to kill you right now.
what?
you had to do it. - What're you-- Do what?
you just... do whatever the hell you want!
and consequences-- they don't matter, do they?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about your agenda again, Kelly...
which apparently includes hitting on my sister!
okay, picture is up! Roll camera! - Mark!
What'd you-- What'd you think she was gonna do? Run off with you?
you're a 17-year-old bag boy. She is a Yale grad student.
talk about living in a fucking fantasy world!
action!
cue the Jeep! - Bart, what do you want me to do?
you want me to be miserable like you? I can do that. Will it make it any better?
you got it all figured out, don't you?
[Woman ] Cue the Jeep! - Better than you do, daddy's boy.
[Engine Starts] - [ Grunts, Growls ] - Hey. Hey!
cue the Jeep!
[ men Shouting ] - Get out of the way!
[ groans ]
it's cool. We can use it. We'll edit it together with some newsreel footage.
It'll-It'll be fine.
what?
[ object Hits Something, Falls to The Ground]
where have you been?
listen, Mom, can we talk about this tomorrow?
your father's gone downhill. They have him on dialysis.
well, that's perfect.
why would you say something like that?
I don't know. It just seems to fit.
seems to fit.
do you understand what I just said?
no, Mom. Why don't you say it again? - [ Sighs ]
when are you going to forgive him?
when am I going to forgive him?
that's quite a question, Mom.
when am I gonna forgive him? Hmm.
uh, I don't know. Maybe when I forget all the lyrics...
to The Little Mermaid sound track he'd play every time he'd take me, so he could score.
maybe when we don't live in a house that's always for sale.
I don't know. I'll forgive him when I go to college. That's when I'll forgive him.
I can't go, can I?
cause he took the money out of my college fund and bought Mexican black tar with it.
and you're asking me to forgive this guy? No way.
all right. Come with me to the hospital.
this isn't about you anymore. - It's never about me.
what is wrong with you? I'm so sick of you being angry.
I wanna be angry. - Mom-- Enough.
you will not tell me what is enough!
you don't know about anything. You
I'm talking about the man I love.
[Door Closes]
Hey, Kelly.
Hey, look, I just-- I thought you should know that I gave my notice, okay?
Kelly? - Oh, hi, Mrs. Bowland.
Bart's not here, honey. - Actually, I was, uh, going to see Tabby.
Ooh. Uh, well, Tabby's at her final fitting. Wedding's tomorrow.
[Siren Wailing in Distance]
damn it!
Goddamn.
Oh
[Bell Tolling]
is everyone in their places? - Yes.
and the organist? - Ready.
where are the cars?
they'll be here in a few minutes. Calm down.
[ Chuckles ]
[Woman ] Hi.
what the hell are you doing?
what do you mean? I was invited. - I uninvited you.
you unin-- It's not your wedding, Bart.
why are you wearing that?
look, I can't let you come in. - Why not?
because you know why. Just go home.
Kelly! What are you doing?
just listen. [ Exhales ]
this is my wedding day. - I know what day it is. I know what day it is.
where do I fit in in all this? Huh?
I thought we really had something. - You know it wasn't like that.
no, I don't know it wasn't like that.
what was it?
it was a moment.
a moment? What the hell is that?
what do you wanna do? Do you wanna stop the wedding?
no. I don't-- I
Oh, come on. You
you shouldn't marry this guy. - Why?
it's like-- You're an artist. Do you know what I mean? You're an artist.
and he
he's not into-- You know what I mean? He's, um
what is he? What does he do? I still don't know.
he's, like, a corporate, money-making, money-manager.
it just doesn't add up.
that's the thing. It doesn't always add up.
[Mr. Bowland knocking] Tabby, honey? You coming out?
[Tabby] kissing you made me feel something that I needed to.
that's all it was.
I'm getting married right now, and I would like you to be happy for me.
[Mr. Bowland] Here she comes!
[Man, Distorted] Here she is!
[ laughing, Cheering ]
Kelly. Hey.
we're just about to start. What, are you taking off?
Yeah.
what are you wearing?
I grew out of my old suit.
Oh, yeah? Me too. Check it out. Rental.
it's funny, you know? A day like this in a guy's life, he doesn't even wear his own clothes.
Yeah. - It's just another thing that doesn't feel real, you know?
especially after everything Tabby and I have been through. [ Chucksles ]
[ softly ] No.
it shouldn't feel that way.
you know, today's the most important day of your life.
no.
no, man. This is just the beginning.
everybody screws up a little. It's what you do afterwards that counts. You know?
[Bell Tolling]
gotta go. See ya.
[Bells Chiming]
[Dog Barking ]
[Chattering ]
[Woman on P. A. ] Dr. Glade to Obstetrics.
[ beeping ]
you're lookin' good.
Keller. [ Laughs ]
out of bed, huh? - Yeah.
feeling better? - Yeah. Better.
they didn't give you shoes?
no, no. They're over there.
you, uh-- You wanna watch some TV?
[Dad] Looks at that. They bolted it to the wall.
my reputation precedes me. [ Laughs ]
come on.
so, any, uh-- Any battles this weekend?
a few.
he looks good.
so, you're new here, huh?
you got any hobbies?
well, that's good.
thanks for your help. Really.
your whimpering sickens us. You die now! - Please, don't do
now! - [ Whimpers ]
[Lance Sobs] - [Phone Ringing]
[Mr. Bowland On Answering Machine ] If you'd like to leave a message...
for the Bowlands-- or Ruby-- please do so after the beep. - [ Beeps ]
[ Kelly On Answering Machine ] Uh, hey, Bowlands. [ Laughs ]
um, it's Kelly.
just callin ' to say that, um...
I'm really sorry that I made a mess of the festivities that happened last weeks.
and, um
and Bart, uh, you know, I'm headin 'down to the Rat's Nest...
to sell off some of my stuff, so any chance you wanna catch me there, uh...
that's where I can be caught.
you're gonna make a killing.
Yep.
will we both be happy
to stand alone
here. - Mm-mmm.
here. - Keep it.
here. Hold it for me then.
I'll stop thinking
or we'll be ordinary love
sounds like you really made an ass out of yourself. - I did.
I did, man.
so if you liked this girl Sarah so much, why didn't you ask her out before?
[Kelly] 'Cause it was forbidden love. - [Bart ] What?
[Kelly] Well, fraternizing is against the Shop-Ease code of conduct. You know.
[ Bart Laughs ] Code of conduct? Dude, it's a grocery store.
[ Kelly ] Hey. Remember, I'm part-owner. All right?
[ Bart Laughs ]
can you hold on for a second? I'm just gonna go
Kelly. - Real quick. Hold on.
are you sure? - Please? Wait up.
one second.
I'm unarmed.
what, you lose your pony, you little, pretty pony boy?
no. No. I wanted to apologize.
for what? Your existence? - No, I was
me and my friends staged the invasion that-- [ Laughs ]
I'm not laughing 'cause it's funny. I'm laughing 'cause I'm nervous. We, um
well, you know, actually, it never happened. It was a dream you had.
well, I'm sorry for the dream. Okay?
all right. Fine.
we're good? - Almost.
what do you mean, "almost"?
[ groans, Coughs ]
[ coughing ] - Kelly!
Hey, Kelly. Hey! [ Laughs ] Hey.
[ groans ] - [ Laughs ]
are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
Ohh.
I deserved it. - [ Laughs ]
is it gettin' big?
Ah.
better.
are you finished now?
no, no. This is just the beginning. See?
because I find that in order to get where you need to go, - Hey!
you gotta cut through all the other stuff first. - [ Laughs ]
so, you know what I mean, kind of? - What are you talking about? Wait!
here, gimme a piggyback-- - [ Sighs ]
please. Please-- - All right.
all right. Up!
keep going! Keep going! Keep going! - [ Groans, Shouts ]

if Barker is clean, you get none worry about it...
but if he's not, you're either going down with him.
or you're gonna end up dead.
I don't care that he bends the rules.
it's the big picture I'm chasing.
don't ever forget again who you work for, either.
the word is, he saved your life this morning.
we got each other's backs.
I couldn't trust the communicators.
anywhere between here and Washington.
and neither can you. -In the bureau?
Yeah. Rogues. You could even be working for one and...
Barker's a part of something.
you don't trust me, do you? - earn it!
can I buy you a drink?
uh, yeah. You can buy me several.
I met a girl.
it's killing you to lie to her? Get rid of her.
no excess baggage. Nothing you can't leave behind.
who is it? - It's your neighbor.
easy.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
okay, time out.
where are you?
I'm standing right here. What?
all right.
I don't need you to look me in the eye.
and tell me how much I mean to you,
but when you're with me...
you need to be with me.
you know what?
forget it. I'm - I'm gonna go.
this is special Agent Michaels from New York.
he's come to help us with a Chinese spy.
who has walked in with leads on intelligence bills.
in half a dozen cities.
his name's Tre Lee Kuo.
he travels the country.
as a cultural attach? For the Chinese.
first spy from there we've turned in six years.
Why?
because the Chinese don't turn.
I'm asking why this one turned.
he's 66 with kidney failure.
we've got the best treatment in the world.
course, he doesn't say that.
throws in the usual stuff about human-rights abuse.
but I figure it's because he wants his plumbing fixed.
how do we know this guy's not a plant?
already given us a few gems that have played out real nice.
this guy's pure gold.
he's got a lead for us right here in Chicago.
even if Kuo doesn't know who,
somebody in your university is selling missile secrets.
they tell me nobody knows this city better than you.
correct me if I am wrong,
but you don't speak Chinese.
we've been over this. No.
then we must wait for our next encounter.
please forgive our manners, sir.
I had hoped for someone who spoke my language,
someone familiar with the Chee-main negotiations,
tensions in Taiwan.
I may be dying, but there are many good reasons why I must be careful to whom I give my information.
speaking Chinese. Speaking Chinese.
I know I'm not what you expected.
but, sir...
I have a feeling you are doing what you're doing.
because you love your country.
not its government, but its people.
Yes.
perhaps I do love them,
as much as you love your people.
if you please, could you grant me one question?
Yes.
how do we find the person selling the secrets?
it is my impression that he is a professor of mathematics.
you gave us that before.
it's his name we need.
in all secret documents,
he is known by the Chinese symbol "peace."
xie xie.
speaking Chinese.
listen, don't let, uh, Michaels rub you the wrong way.
he does not exist.
we, uh, ran with what Kuo said.
about the mathematics professor.
narrowed it down to one guy.
okay.
let's see who you are.
tianfang0011@gmail.com
hello. Yes, Bob. I'm very happy to be here today.
and, naturally, it's an honor to receive...
so, that's our man Shelby, huh?
reporter's asking him about the Abel Prize in mathematical physics, an award he just got.
I'm donating the prize money...
whoa. He gets a lot of awards.
and you think he's our spy?
he'd make a good one.
deserves to be shared with my...
he has the highest security clearance of any academic.
that consults for NSA and the department of defense.
for good money, says here.
maybe not good enough for Shelby.
degrees from Yale, Stanford.
I can't even read half of these articles.
Oh, really? Not even the one on Quantum Loop Theory?
I think I'll wait till that one comes out on the sports page.
I'm just grateful to give back to this great country.
look at this - six trips to Asia in the last eight years.
and five of them to China.
nothing makes me more proud than what I can contribute to our nation's defense.
the award citation says I'm a hero.
but the real heroes are the men and women in uniform.
what is that line about patriotism?
it's "the Last Refuge of a Scoundrel"?
there he goes. Just got out of class.
now, what makes you think a guy like that would turn?
money, pride...
feeling like the world doesn't know how special you are.
who gives a damn why?
now, listen, you want to be talking to students, colleagues, - The guy that washes his car. - got it. Got it.
and with an ego like he's probably got,
the list of people who hate him has got to be as big as Montana.
so, what's your first move?
recon found where his math study group meets.
math grad students.
good luck.
tell me about it.
so, where will you be?
somewhere else.
so, don't ever miss a meeting again.
and I hope you had a lousy time.
tell us, Adam.
I have class, and I don't want to spend all day on this.
okay, there's got to be a line.
that completes a circle in a mile.
not the South Pole, but near.
so rules that out.
I hate this.
north Pole, maybe.
you guys mind?
Oh, yeah, please.
mind if I ask what's the problem?
you a math student here?
thinking about it.
Adam is torturing us.
okay, how many points are there.
where you can walk one mile south,
one mile east, and one mile north.
and still end up in the exact same spot?
this ought to be good.
um, this...
this is just a guess, but...
that'd be an infinite number.
Squared...plus one.
the "plus one" is the North Pole.
look.
well, Jake, I really think you should consider Chicago.
well, the reason I'd come is to work with Warren Shelby.
Ooh, let me guess.
you saw his "World of Numbers" series on PBS,
and it changed your life.
like Jennifer.
well, actually, I'm more into his defense work.
probably never let his tas
get anywhere near that stuff, though.
not a chance.
truth is, he won't even notice you.
Why?
you don't have boobs.
anyway, it's what everybody says.
what does everyone say?
you heard about Jodi Williams?
what? Tell me.
girl two years ago got a little obsessed with Professor Shelby.
she committed suicide.
if Shelby didn't walk on water around here,
the police would be all over him.
he's not only potentially a seller of government secrets.
and not only is he screwing his students,
but he might also have been involved in one of them dying.
he broke it off with her just before it happened.
I don't know.
maybe she threatened to go to his wife.
have you found anyone that likes this Shelby?
his chairman.
says Shelby's, uh, gonna win a Nobel.
well, he'll be the first one to receive it from behind bars.
yes?
Mr. Sampson.
Yes. Professor Shelby.
you don't know how pleased I am. This is a true honor.
please.
thank you.
you have some credentials?
Absolutely.
an old cold war axiom.
trust, but verify.
thank you.
so, you come highly recommended by Kiteling.
and he is working on the same that I've brought you.
midcourse missile interception.
Mm-hmm.
you made progress?
now our problem is targeting.
that can sort through these decoys.
well, yes, that's the hard part.
Yes.
but the actual warhead has greater mass,
and even in space,
residual effects of gravity can be calculated.
so you'll give it a try?
I'll do my best.
wonderful.
now, it's pro-forma,
but I need to remind you of the protocol.
of course.
the data is on this thumb drive.
do not copy it.
do not remove it from this office.
the codes will only activate on this computer.
I understand. I'll get right on it.
have a good day.
how's it going? He fall for it?
hook, line, and sinker.
I got eyes on him right now. Good.
kuo will tell us when something appears on the Chinese side.
is the tap live? - Yeah.
computer, phone, GPS on the thumb drive, but he knows it.
so whatever he's doing, it's gonna be low-tech.
so do not let the man out of your sight, all right?
did you log your interactions with Thomason here?
guess who. No!
okay.
later.
wish I had more manpower here.
operation like this in New York, we'd have 100 men.
so, these are Kuo's contacts.
the Chinese have penetrated missile defense.
the Department of Energy.
who knows where Shelby's information will surface.
is your tail on him?
24/7.
Hey.
there's my girl.
you hungry?
we've already eaten!
you know I hate it when you shout from the other room!
sorry.
just had to finish a few things first.
I got another assignment from the Defense Department today.
that's good. Yeah.
daddy, do you want to play Mozart?
Yes, I would love to play Mozart.
how many men you got on him?
agent Ellis Dove. One guy.
for the Al Hamid case, I ran nine agents.
Yeah, in New York, maybe,
but a cavalry regiment in Highland Park,
just might draw a little attention.
Oh, wait -- which is also what I heard.
tipped off Al Hamid's backup, right?
he is still M.I.A. is he not?
97% I.O. rate.
best in the bureau.
yeah?
it's Kuo.
that's it.
that's the formula I gave him.
thank you.
it showed up in the Chinese database.
okay. We got the son of a bitch.
what's up?
uh, yeah, where's Shelby right now?
I'm looking at him.
he's playing piano with his daughter.
so, are you Agent Ellis, this is Michaels.
where was your mark an hour ago?
teaching his class, and then he came straight home.
well, nobody's been in his office.
the thumb drive hasn't been accessed since he left.
you -- you had to have missed it.
no.
Ellis didn't miss anything.
bullshit! Shelby made a drop.
your guy screwed up, Barker.
it's not possible. I've been sitting on him the whole time.
you said these guys were good. This is sloppy work.
your partner may have blown the case.
we don't have anything unless we catch Shelby in the act!
easy, Michaels. - This whole thing's amateur hour.
Ugh! - Hey, hey!
are you crazy?!
easy.
you owe my partner an apology.
apology?!
this isn't gonna be forgotten.
I should hope not.
Ellis, you, uh, still there?
that sounded like Barker just clocked somebody.
Yeah, you'd better come in.
you're cleaning this up.
man, I wish I'd seen it.
Uh...colossal mistake.
necessary, maybe.
and fun, I bet.
Ohh, yeah.
but still a mistake.
is Michaels gonna file a complaint?
to hell with him.
so, is there any way you missed that drop?
no.
the office, campus...
had to be electronic.
no, he was bugged.
did the thumb drive leave the office?
it is still in the same place.
so he cracked it, he copied it, he dropped it.
well, I don't know how.
which means right under our nose,
Shelby sent military secrets to the damn Chinese.
why don't we bring him in, then, if we know he did it?
we can't, because Michaels is right about one thing.
we can't use the transmission alone to arrest Shelby.
if we did, we'd be compromising Kuo.
we've got to find separate confirmation.
all right. I'll go back over the ground.
no, sir. I have a new job for you. Come here.
right there...
are 13, 000 pages delivered to us by Kuo.
so, you are looking for anything.
that even smells like it came from Shelby.
you got to be kidding.
Well...get to it.
they're not gonna read themselves.
so, you got anything?
just stuff that says he's a pretty good capitalist...
for a Communist spy.
tax shelters, houses - we knew all that.
so we trace the money.
follow up on the wire transfers.
they should head right back to his defense work.
not good enough.
no?
so, I just saw Michaels.
his men found something in those garbage bags from behind Shelby's house.
What'd they find?
a cellphone.
the throwaway kind from a convenience store.
you trace the luds on it?
7:00 p. m. on th17th, Shelby called a safe house.
7?
I would have seen him on the phone. I didn't see him.
obviously, you didn't.
and what? He tosses it behind his house?
come on, man. That doesn't make any.
the cellphone gives us all we need.
I'm standing in front of the Chicago Math Department,
where professor Shelby was arrested.
that was Conrad.
Shelby just confessed.
he also says Michaels is thrilled, we're a great team,
and all is forgiven - even the pop in the mouth.
I just don't see how he made the call.
maybe it was prerecorded or a time-set data dump.
bad guy's in jail. Michaels gets his victory lap.
everybody wins.
you met the guy. What do you think?
robert Hanssen walked the halls of the FBI for years,
and nobody knew he was selling secrets.
so the best can fool anyone.
still...
as we say in the corps, "jdfr."
just doesn't feel right.
so, you got anything else but a feeling?
Nope.
well, you can always do more digging.
you got an itch, scratch it.
maybe drop in on Michaels' Chinese source.
Kuo?
Yeah.
you gonna help me on this?
Unh-unh.
you're the one with the doubts.
as far as I'm concerned, god's in his heaven,
and one more bad guy's on the inside.
Kuo's dead.
where are you? - Chinatown.
passed some guy in a hell of a hurry in the hallway.
can you I.D. him?
happened too quickly.
kuo was trying to write something in Chinese.
maybe the contact.
looks like he got halfway through writing it when he...
can you fire it over to me?
Yeah. Should I call this in?
no, no, no, no. You go to cover, and you wait for my call.
all right.
you sure you want to do this without letting Michaels know?
you and he are just beginning to get right, you know.
I never figured we had much of a future, anyway.
can I do this?
what was the name you used - Sampson?
Yeah.
actually the name of my high-school math teacher.
never broke a "c.
I can't imagine what this is about.
I remember actually signing a confession.
right.
and I remember celebrating...
for a couple of hours.
and then what?
well, you got students.
I have one, too.
and he just started asking questions.
that's what a good student does.
asks questions, brings up problems.
so, here's one for you.
tell me what that is.
I can tell you it's Chinese. That's all.
Really?
I would think a spy for the Chinese should know.
that that is the character for a woman.
that'd be reasonable speculation on your part. Nothing more.
speculation.
I got a confession.
everything we found out about you.
it just pissed me off.
the way you stuffed your pockets.
you took what you wanted from everybody and everything.
nothing life had to offer was good enough for you.
I already told you I was guilty.
you got me painting a picture of a guy who would do anything - anything for a little secret glory.
but now...
you know the bottom line?
you're just not a good liar.
and whatever else you are, you're not a traitor, either.
you don't know anything about me.
you're right.
cause I sure as hell don't know why you're about to spend.
the rest of your life in prison for something you did not do.
I did this.
whatever happens to me, I deserve it.
okay.
but what exactly did you do?
a lot on your mind. I can imagine.
you married?
divorced. Two kids.
love them to death. Wish I could see them more.
why don't you?
why do you think?
came down to job or family. Tried to do both.
one was never satisfied.
well, I think you made the wrong choice.
I don't.
what were you thinking dropping in on Kuo?
double agent, foreign flag, ends up dead.
you know how bad this looks?
the most important Chinese asset in a decade dead,
and you were the last man to see him.
we got a dozen open cases that now we can't pursue.
you know I didn't kill him.
I'm on your side, but the bureau,
if they find out you were there, I can't protect you.
did Barker send you?
I went on my own.
you're so twisted around.
you don't know which way is up anymore, do you?
Barker went to Shelby, showed him a Chinese symbol.
yeah?
what did Shelby say?
that's not my case. Barker's my case.
all I want to know is where Barker got the symbol.
I don't know.
well, the assumption is, Barker's connected to Shelby.
he just wanted to know...
the trail ends at Shelby's door.
that's all.
we're closing in on Barker, Ellis.
you don't want to get caught on the wrong side of this.
get anything else out of Shelby?
washington's all jazzed - way we bagged him.
and I made it a big "we" - you and me.
well...
I think we bagged the wrong guy.
and you're basing this on...?
watching him.
Michaels, the guy is covering up for something.
or covering for someone.
look at that. That's what Kuo was writing when he...
Oh, Jesus.
don't tell me you were involved in his death - his murder.
kuo was dead when found.
"Found"? By whom?
that is the symbol for a woman.
I believe the contact is a woman.
but the confession, the cellphone.
I have reason to think.
that there may be a problem with the evidence.
wait. Wait.
if there was any tampering, I don't want to hear it.
now, we're all cops here, Barker.
we know about keeping a plant in your shoe.
in case a guilty man needs convicting - a gun, some dope.
if you went the extra yard here, I don't need to know it.
and I'll deny this conversation ever took place.
Michaels, if Shelby is guilty, that's one thing,
but if we got him wrong...
I'm not even considering that.
then we got two problems.
an innocent guy is behind bars.
and a traitor is still out there.
a traitor who can compromise our missile-defense system.
we have to reopen this case.
they warned me about you.
we won.
thank you for your service.
go home.
we're better than this.
Kuo's death - the way he died at his desk.
looks a hell of a lot like the way Shelby's girl did when she died.
same hitter.
one of theirs.
so, obviously, Shelby did not kill Jodi Williams.
actually...
I don't think he had a clue about any of this.
until Michaels showed up with the cuffs.
what about the phone?
what about the phone?
okay.
why did he confess?
you think Michaels' cub scouts forced it out of him?
there's only one reason I can think of.
check this out.
peace sign - the contact. We've been over this.
no.
if you draw a roof over it, it's a peace sign.
that symbol alone is the sign of a woman.
so Kuo must have figured out Shelby was not the contact.
we should have been looking for a woman all this time.
the wife?
she has the means, she has the motive,
and god knows the man could not keep it in his pants.
you want me to visit the wife?
might be a good idea.
will I be going with FBI consent?
Nope.
is there a problem with that?
Nope.
good.
Hi. Ellis Dove. I just called.
Oh, about the house. Yeah, of course.
I'm sorry that, uh, the place is such a mess.
I was hoping to get it cleaned up.
before I put it on the market.
the FBI do this?
just the inside.
the windows are courtesy of angry patriots.
but they have assured us that they will notify on the internet protest sites that we moved out.
in case that worries you.
actually, I'm not here about the house.
look, what else do you want from me?
my husband's in prison.
my daughter can't even go to school.
I - we have to leave our home.
I have told you people everything that I know.
I don't think your husband did this.
but someone close to him did.
a woman.
you know about Jodi Williams.
he broke it off with her a couple months before she died.
turns out that he fell for another student.
she became unstable.
she came to me and said that she was gonna blog.
about Professor Shelby's new girlfriend.
and then she died.
did Jodi give her name?
no.
but I met her.
you just know when you meet one.
he has a type.
this one was Asian.
if you knew about the women...
why'd you stay with him?
you should see him with my daughter.
so, there are two Asian grad students in Shelby's department.
one is Elsa Tan.
not Shelby's type.
and vice versa.
married with two kids.
and the other chick is this one,
Jennifer Ling.
I met her in one of the study groups.
that's our spy.
Yeah, but the thing is, she's Taiwanese.
they're fighting for independence from China.
why would she sell secrets to the enemy?
well, like any other country, there are traitors.
and there are those fooled by them.
go get her.
Jake?
none of us can believe what's going on.
with Shelby?
Yeah.
I-I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
but I hope you still want to come to school here.
walk with me.
I know about the affair.
what?
this must be some kind of mistake.
Nope.
I traced the records.
three weekend trips to his Wisconsin house.
I could care less about what you and Shelby were up to.
but the treason - see, that's a problem.
try and run.
I'll shoot you in the head.
I.
what I did, I did for my country.
and what, betray this country at the same time?
I have family in Taiwan.
I was just trying to help protect them.
you think you understand the Chinese threat?
they've got 300 icbms pointed at Taiwan,
less than 200 miles away.
they will use them.
Taiwan?
taiwan is where you think you're sending your information?
only missile-defense technology,
which America sells to them, anyway.
we're on the same side.
it's been going to the Chinese.
you're lying.
a man is about to spend his life in prison.
our Chinese asset is dead.
the only lie being told here is the one you are telling yourself!
now, what I need to know is how you got the data off that thumb drive.
talk!
when Warren first got his computer,
I replaced his motherboard with one that gave me backdoor access.
what did he tell you?
what are you talking about?
because I never involved him. He never knew.
what about the call to the Chinese safe house?
what safe house?
the call he made from the disposable cellphone.
warren doesn't have a cellphone.
he thinks they cause brain cancer.
he's like a nut about it.
he doesn't - he doesn't own one.
get in the car.
get in.
if she's telling the truth,
please tell me it was Michaels who planted the phone.
are you kidding me?
you planted evidence?
no choice.
I've trusted you every step of the way.
and, believe me, it hasn't been easy.
I was protecting your screw-up.
you just heard.
you know that I didn't screw up.
when national security is at stake,
often, there is collateral damage.
so, what are you gonna do now?
leave her with me.
you're going down the wrong road, Ellis.
you know what I'm starting to think?
you did that a long time ago.
it's right there on the corner.
so, is this where's around you make all your drops?
this month, yeah.
I have to ask you something.
he figured it out, didn't he?
that it was me, that I betrayed him.
Shelby never said a word about you.
but he confessed.
so he must have been protecting someone,
and it must have been me.
even if he knew you weren't spying for the Chinese,
he's throwing away his life.
I'm aware of that.
so? Do you know why?
because we were in love.
or he was, and he thought you were.
what?
nothing you'd understand.
try me.
I did what I did for my family and my country.
but I couldn't have let myself if I didn't feel love, too.
go make the drop. I'll be right behind you.
help me!
let me go!
let me go!
shut up!
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let her go, man.
let her go.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
it's okay.
I-I really can't - I can't take this.
this is - this is too much for me to...
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
stay with me, all right?
trust me. Okay? Okay.
listen up. You want to help me?
here's your chance.
find anything on him?
clean.
you did the right thing calling me.
you need to dispose of him...
and take care of her.
is she the spy?
she wasn't working for the Chinese.
she didn't know she was, anyway.
what difference does that make?
a lot. She thought she was helping Taiwan, our ally.
I don't care who she's selling secrets to.
a traitor's a traitor.
I'm not giving her to Michaels.
we going through this again?
I assume by now,
you know that Michaels planted evidence on Shelby.
why didn't you call Barker?
you gonna help me or not?
Yeah. Don't worry.
I'll dispose of the body.
in the next day or two,
you're gonna hear a rumor about a Chinese defector.
Why?
it'll explain his disappearance.
so they don't come looking for you.
am I going into a witness-protection program?
no.
we're gonna turn you.
you're working for us now.
what do I have to do?
your friend here thinks you can be useful since he killed the only one on their side who was onto you.
we're gonna keep you in place.
you keep doing what you're doing.
I...don't understand.
you want me to keep giving information. To the Chinese government?
Yeah. But it'll be stuff we want to give them
rock-solid disinformation.
Raymond here will hook you up with a defense lab in town.
I just - I don't know if I can do this.
what's your name?
Jennifer Ling.
Jennifer, we really don't want to have to say
that you don't have a choice.
so make it your choice.
Congratulations.
you may have just landed the FBI its new Kuo.
so, you turned the girl.
Yep.
Michaels help you set that up?
Nope.
then who?
sometimes you disappear...
make a call.
you got some interesting friends.
so do I.
it all worked out.
here he comes.
they told me I was free to go.
you are.
I have one question.
did you know
that Jennifer was selling your work to the Chinese?
I didn't - not until you arrested me.
why'd you cover for her?
doesn't make sense.
since when does love make sense?
I was trying to protect her.
and it was worth destroying your family,
letting the world think you're a traitor?
those were foregone conclusions.
the only question for me was whether I was gonna let this destroy her, too.
you want a lift?
where?
wherever.
there's nowhere to take me.
I have nowhere to go.
nothing.
whatever you're gonna say, don't.
Hey.
Hey.
you up for a race?
5 miles.
what's - what's going on?
look...
I don't want you to think this is something that it's not.
I don't.
I don't need it to be anything else.
didn't that occur to you?
how could I?
you'll disappear for days, and when you come back,
half the time, you look like you've been run over by a truck.
or you're evasive or you're an emotional wreck.
you could do so much better than me.
and you get to decide that?
Yeah. I'll see you around.
tell me you're gonna put your target to bed real soon.
I will.
but not on this case.
I played ball - let Kuo go to Barker.
so you'd have a shot at exposing him.
Barker covers his tracks well.
another mess. It's a mess every time I come down here.
maybe it's you.
how's the jaw?
you get anything from Ellis?
I will.
I've earned his trust.
more important than trust, he owes you.
and Jennifer.
I want to keep her clean. She's a big yield.
you losing steam?
Nope.
Barker made a mistake - a monster.
but when he realized it, he reversed field.
he wasn't about to let the wrong guy go down.
you were.
sometimes I feel they got me watching the wrong people.
you ought to keep that kind of thought to yourself.
it'd be safer.
to hell with safer.
tianfang0011@gmail.com
I have cancer, Rebecca!
I will be forever changed.
promise me you will not tell Sean.
clearly, Rebecca told you.
you should have told me.
I think we have to stop here.
we've done two rounds, and the tumors are unchanged.
I want a second opinion.
have you heard of a Dr. Atticus Sherman?
paul read about a stage IV woman who was completely cured after seeing him.
I got an appointment with Dr. Sherman!
welcome back!
you look awesome!
Oh, shit.
Hey, Mrs. Jamison.
welcome back. - Thank you, Han.
we're raising money for you.
we heard the treatment didn't work.
you don't need to raise m - I hope you don't mind.
we used your first name.
we like the alliteration.
cupcakes...
and cancer!
we didn't think about that.
on the house.
seriously, Washington had wooden false teeth.
he didn't even have to brush them. He would just repaint them.
Oh, hi. Can I help you?
this is my class.
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.
you must be Cathy.
well, kids, it looks like my job here is done.
that sucks.
she was only here for three weeks, people.
we'll miss you so much.
you're so sweet!
facebook me if you want.
she's a sub. She's just going back to wherever subs come from.
she's not dying.
well, uh... Good luck to you.
and to you.
I hate her too.
so...They take all the mirrors out of your house or something?
you don't look good.
thank you!
finally, someone telling the truth.
the interleukin kinda took it out of me.
you could still use some mascara.
glad you're back.
me too.
want a hug?
no, thanks.
Hey! How are you?
you okay?
Hey. You going to lunch?
why don't you ask me what you really want to ask me, okay?
how am I?
you know, am I totally bummed because my mom has cancer?
do I want another fucking cancer cupcake?
because they're free for me.
I just wanted to know if you were going to lunch.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
good.
I'll save you a seat, freak.
she had plushy toys all over my desk.
it's like I never existed!
come on.
kids always love the subs.
Oh, God, all those cancer faces.
it's like I'm starring in my own Greek tragedy.
okay.
your last round of treatment...
within $100 without going over.
1252
so sorry, Cathy Jamison.
correct answer is...
2, 047. 33!
that's a lot of cupcakes.
but insurance covers 90%, so please write a check for $204. 33.
you know, this is why stage IV people go so fast.
they can't afford to stick around.
Hey. No more downer talk.
tomorrow...
we are meeting the renowned Dr. Atticus Sherman, and I, for one, am prepared to be wowed.
you be wowed. I'll be drunk.
I'm going to work.
have a great day.
Sean, honey, are you just gonna sit in there all day with no pants on?
perhaps.
Loo...kI get that the whole "my sister has cancer" thing is a huge bummer huge.
but you have to start coping a teeny bit.
we're gonna have a baby.
well, you better hope that baby doesn't have a sister...
cause sisters lie and die.
they make pills, Sean.
you'll feel better.
I probably even have some in my bag right now.
no, thank you, nurse Ratched.
how many times do I have to write stage IV?
it's depressing.
sorry.
didn't mean to eavesdrop.
I used to get so annoyed writing that, I just started putting "royally f'ed" each time.
you're in a pretty good mood for someone who's royally f'ed.
I got some good news for once.
Dr. Sherman says I'm in great shape.
and I just made it into this terrific melanoma clinical trial he's running.
Oh, I like the sound of that. - Yeah, me too.
it's had remarkable results in Europe.
ask him about it.
I will.
I hope it's not forward of me, but...
here's my number.
in case you ever want to chat or have any questions.
I'm Nadine.
this is an angel coin.
it was my good luck charm but...
I think it's done its trick for me.
thank you.
good luck.
Mrs. Jamison?
how long has it been?
27 minutes.
so rude!
you know, I like that he's late.
it means that he spends a lot of time with his patients.
why do they always have paintings of women looking out of windows?
they waiting for us to jump?
well, hi, there.
paul Jamison. Husband.
Atticus Sherman. Catherine. Hello.
Cathy. Patient.
I figured as much.
although what's going on there, buddy?
cause there's a heart attack in there with your name on it.
okay, let's take a look.
no shortness of breath, muscle weakness?
not yet.
okay, that's good. Take deep breaths.
glad you came to see me.
I don't have good feelings about that Doogie Howser I talked with on the phone.
Dr. Mauer?
he sounded like he was 16.
I know, right?
did I make a mistake doing the interleukin 2 treatment?
no. You went in for the nuclear blast first.
it's a fine choice.
just didn't work out for you so, you know, onward.
I met one of your patients, Nadine, in the waiting room.
isn't she a trip?
she's got more energy than all of us. She's doing great.
she was telling me about a clinical trial you're doing?
Yeah. I'm very excited about the potential with that especially with the late stage patients.
fantastic. So when do we start that?
it's all filled up. There are no more spots.
Seriously?
Hey, no long faces. We'll figure something out.
wait a minute. So we're...we're done?
Yeah. Let me study your scans, and I'll be in touch.
we've been waiting 27 minutes.
here. Take my card.
email me with any questions.
Thegreatshermtini. com"?
Yeah, I do a little amateur magicianing on the side, you know, bend the occasional spoon for the kids.
no chance you can bend the rules for me and get me into that trial?
only spoons.
the Great Shermtini, my ass.
he couldn't put one extra person into his trial?
he said I was fat.
don't I deserve it as much as that other woman?
you deserve it more than that other woman.
don't say that.
it's true!
Yeah, you're right.
Nadine's what she's like 20 years older than I am.
she's already had that extra time.
I want that time!
plus he said she was doing great.
she doesn't need the trial.
it's not fair.
it's beyond not fair.
Oh, I shouldn't say that.
why not?
why don't you deserve to be angry about this?
I am! It is absurdly not fair!
let's go get a burger! I want a burger.
you want a burger? - I can't.
I've gotta go with Rebecca to her doctor.
Sean's too depressed to do it.
Aw, honey.
your life is so not fair right now. - I know.
you see that?
that's the beginnings of fingers.
look at that.
please tell me it doesn't have webbed feet.
it all looks fine.
the baby daddy is bipolar, so this kid could be a little wacky.
that's hereditary, right?
that's not my specialty.
what if the baby has it, and I catch it through the umbilical cord?
that can't happen.
can we concentrate on the positive here?
be happy.
there's so many other things not to be happy about.
she has cancer.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
is melanoma hereditary?
I can't believe I never asked!
Oh, my God! All right, enough!
you're having a child.
this is a miracle on so many levels, so we...
we have to celebrate this moment!
let's just enjoy this.
you hear that? The heartbeat.
Oh, my God!
is it a girl?
it it sounds like a girl.
it's a little too early to be 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing and not seeing,
I would guess it's a girl.
it's a girl.
I'm home!
Hey. How was school?
this was on my locker.
that's sweet.
no, mom, look at this. It's not sweet. It's creepy.
I mean, ever since school started three weeks ago, I've been getting more attention than that albino kid.
okay. The sparkles are a little creepy.
but you know...
they care about you and what you're going through.
you're the one with the cancer, mom.
thanks for reminding me.
Hey, Adam. - Hey, what's up?
what are you making? It smells like ass.
quinoa and cauliflower.
cruciferous vegetables are antioxidants.
haven't you been punished enough?
apparently not.
I was thinking about what you said earlier about staying positive.
good.
and, um, I want you to throw me a baby shower.
Oh, of course.
it'll be so nice in the spring. We could do it outside.
I was thinking maybe this week.
Oh, come on!
what, you said so yourself. We can't wait.
we have to celebrate every good moment.
Rebecca, you're what? You're, like, 11 weeks pregnant.
I mean, technically, that isn't even
think about the photos. We're at our peak.
neither of us is gonna look any better than we do right now.
we have to do this before I get fat and you get all...cancery.
in case I'm too sick to say it then, screw you.
Sean is in a tent, and you're dying.
having a little fun wouldn't kill us.
unfortunate use of words.
but I hear you.
Oh, good! Great!
so I'll invite a few gals and their daughters.
it doesn't have to be anything fancy, no gifts.
just hand me downs. That's what Sean would want.
not that he gives a crap about anything nowadays.
man, you really did a number on him.
Rebecca, it's complicated.
I think it would help if you apologized for lying and for not telling him for so long.
how about you apologize for telling him what I asked you not to.
what, I I You you have done enough.
you stay out of this one.
we're all family now, Cath.
seriously.
you are an awesome aunt.
I thought you might like to know we're having a girl.
what?
how do you know that?
I had my first sonogram today.
and you didn't tell me?
Jesus!
first Cathy and now you.
I'm surrounded by she liars.
like if I had told you, you would have gone?
well, maybe.
maybe you should have given me the option.
you know what, Sean?
this is supposed to be a fucking happy time.
I'm fucking pregnant, and I'm not gonna have you fucking bring this down, okay?
it's my baby too.
how do you expect to be a decent parent when you won't even put on a goddamn pair of pants?
Cathy, what are you doing?
do you think I can give this baby a broken lamp?
probably not.
you know, I've been digging through this crap for the last hour, looking for a present for this baby.
sorry fetus.
and God forbid Sean should come out of his tent depression and help.
honey, you're still recovering from your treatment.
you've got to take it easy.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, look at this!
they're my baby clothes my mom saved.
do you think Adam would want them when he has kids?
you think Adam will even have kids?
bet he will.
kids should have siblings.
make sure he has a bunch, okay?
what, so they can get along like you and Sean?
Rebecca...thinks this is all my fault.
well, you know what?
fuck Rebecca. And Sean is a grown up, okay?
look, how about this?
perfect.
Yeah, that could work.
Hey, Mrs. J.
what's up, mom?
Oh, I like you two together.
you'd make cute babies.
not now. Someday.
are you kidding me?
is that my old big wheel?
Yeah. I'm gonna give it to Rebecca for the baby shower.
what? You can't give this away.
it's mine.
come on, buddy, you're a little big for that, aren't ya?
Yeah, just a little.
Adam No. No. No way.
you don't even fit on it anymore.
totally can.
fine. You can ride it, you can keep it.
that's what I thought.
I think this cancer might be affecting him more than he thinks.
go!
three...
lift and spread. Lift and spread.
Rebecca, you're falling behind.
no, I'm not!
boom. Done!
Oh, my God!
13 seconds.
well, at least I have another six months to work on it.
thank you for helping me with all this.
I love a party, but seriously...
that lady should not be a mother.
you are really a diaper prodigy.
I was way into babysitting as a kid.
Hey, maybe I should hire you as my nanny.
Why? 'Cause I'm black?
ruby. What schools are you looking at?
did my mom say we were here looking at colleges?
she's taking me to Hazelden.
rehab?
ruby. You're ruining the party.
Oh, come on, I mean...
who here hasn't been to rehab, right?
pretty much all of us.
Oh, those are adorable.
they have Cs on them.
I I...I didn't have a lot of time to deal with food.
it's perfect!
okay. Great.
because I've decided that I'm gonna name the baby Cathy!
little Cs for Cathy.
but she's Cathy.
right! Isn't it awesome? - No.
wait. So this baby will be named Cathy Tolke like my mom was Cathy Tolke?
is Cathy Tolke. I'm not dead yet.
Cathy has cancer.
I mean, not my Cathy!
that Cathy.
see? It's already confusing.
okay, loo...kmaybe someone else healthy would be excited about this, but I'm sorry, I'm not.
out of all of the millions of names out there, you go for mine?
I thought you would be touched. It's an homage.
excuse me.
you're welcome.
Jesus.
how 'bout, how 'bout, you know, Monica?
or Lydia. Or Hannah.
how 'bout Hannah?
Monica was the name of my third grade teacher.
I hate Monica.
how about Monique?
or maybe one of the flower names.
okay. Okay.
so this whole Cathy Tolke thing is gonna be a big problem when she's growing up across the street and we start getting each other's mail and phone calls and such, 'cause I might be around for a while.
it was Dr. Sherman's office.
he added a spot for me in the clinical trial.
Yes!
that's so great!
I'm just gonna get some soda.
that's cool.
use it or lose it.
sorry about your mom and the whole cancer shit.
Yeah, well, sorry about rehab.
guess we're both fucked. - Yeah.
you wanna feel better?
no, I don't smoke, so...
I'm just gonna go upstairs.
that's not what I meant.
I have a girlfriend.
so do I.
wait Hello. This is Cathy Jamison calling.
is Nadine there?
I met your mom last week at Dr. Sherman's office, and I was Oh, my God.
I I'm... I'm so sorry, I - Nadine died. - Who?
the woman. Paul, the coin woman.
I called her to tell her that I got into the trial, and Man! She looked so alive.
well, now she's not.
he said she was doing so great. She died?
just like that?
that is royally fucked.
she gave me her lucky coin, and then she died.
Cathy, it's not your fault.
Oh, my God!
that's why there was an extra spot for me.
I climbed over a dead woman's body to get into that trial!
I am not gonna play that game with you, honey.
you got into the trial 'cause you deserve to get into the trial.
what, and she didn't?
I'm not saying she deserved to die, Cathy, but you deserve a chance to live just like she did Did something happen in the basement yesterday?
what? No.
I mean...No.
your mom thinks that Ruby was smoking pot down there.
Oh, yeah? Yeah. I I don't know. Maybe.
she was weird. - She was.
we and And boom!
there's your goldfish.
wait a minute! What's this?
what are you doing with that in your head?
let's put it back in.
Oh, it came out the other side.
how did I do that?
look at this.
Dr. Sherman.
I'm performing here.
well, your office told me you were up here. I just I need a minute.
this is my assistant.
this is Mrs. Jamison!
look at that. Very good. She's good, isn't she?
it was Nadine's space, wasn't it?
I replaced Nadine.
the Great Shermtini is gonna take a five minute break.
you told me you added a slot.
now, why wouldn't you tell me the truth?
why wouldn't you tell me she died?
I don't discuss other patients.
we're not patients. We're people.
but I don't know how you would know that, since you only seem to spend two minutes with each of us.
I know you're a 43 year old woman presenting with advanced metastatic disease.
I know you have a small tumor in the soft tissue behind your kidney which the last scans didn't show.
I know you're very sick, and I think this trial could save your life.
how can I trust you?
you told a dying woman that she was great. Why?
to make her feel better?
I don't wanna feel better.
I wanna be better.
what would you like to hear, Mrs. Jamison?
if you're gonna be my doctor if...
you're going to be my doctor, I need you always, always have to be honest with me.
you want honesty?
people die.
before trials, during trials.
half these kids are not gonna make it outta here.
and as groundbreaking as I expect this trial to be,
I'm still gonna lose patients.
we'll learn something from every death, so when the next patient comes through, maybe they won't suffer as much.
maybe they'll live longer. But make no bones about it.
we all get replaced.
I'm gonna die.
and some other doctor will come through here and replace me.
probably not your Doogie Howser but, you know, still...
look, I'm not going to beg you to do this trial.
if you're too shortsighted to not take the chance just because you don't like my bedside manner, trust me there are hundreds of people who are waiting to replace you.
that's the truth.
I'm wearing pants.
this is for Rebecca and the baby.
Thanks.
I'm sorry I lied to you.
and I'm sorry if my being sick is hard for you.
it's really hard for me too.
it has hands.
she has little hands.
Yeah.
I wanna be better.
then take the meds, Sean.
you know what they do to me, Cath.
they they dull me out.
they make me all normal.
I I wear button down shirts.
I watch TV.
Yeah. Sometimes you do.
I I don't want numb Sean to replace fun Sean.
you think you're having fun right now?
the tent's pretty cool.
do you have any idea how jealous I am of you?
here.
you can take a pill and spend all the time you want with your kid. I can't.
how the hell can you not fight to be better when that's all I'm doing right now?
you could make a good dad, Sean.
a really good dad.
I'm I'm sorry you're sick.
Yeah, well, I'm starting this new clinical trial, so God only knows how sick I'm gonna be.
and hey, no matter what, you'll always have a little Cathy Tolke in your life.
Rebecca hasn't told you.
told me what?
she wants to name the baby Cathy.
no. - Oh, yeah.
now, that...is insane.
Yeah, right?
I mean, who who would name their baby Cathy?
I
I trust my you - why - i lied.
let's come on
you got divorced anyway.
whenever his wife talked back, he packed her a one-two punch
from our feminist point of view, that's not right
Penisism?
l said l was going to divorce her, and her brother came with a 4×4
to beat me to death lf Big Mouth hadn't stopped him, he would've smashed me
big Mouth, that bastard
Hey, when he wasn't on drugs, he was in great shape
back then was my golden years
still have the strength?
l don't use any strength l use my head
lift up this table l couldn't lift this long time ago
what's wrong?
but raising it now would be a con
stop with the show and deal!
l have to fold l bet 100, 000
raise you three more l got your three
see if those checks are real
raise you five more
this is my last game folks 13 million more take it all
someone's treating to the club
call, l will
this will fool anybody Four of a kind
look at this
wait, Big Mouth had an ace before
Freeze!
don't move, damn it l'm pretty patient.
but not with cheating on cards.
Hey!
why'd you break the mood?
gasoline, play with my money
Hey, the odds on that is 0. 1936%
you're really fun
master Kim, it wasn't because of the money
clear it up for another round!
clear it up for another round!
master Kim, it wasn't because of the money
clear it up for another round!
Assoline
that bastard Chang-hyuk has got no respect
give me some more
Hey, do you wanna team up?
team up? Yeah
how could we double-cross Master Kim when we're all family?
family, my ass
we're just a bunch of swindlers
a bunch of swindlers?
so what's your plan? My plan?
hit and run!
so who could this woman be?
seo ln-kyung?
detective Park is trailing her, right?
after they met in the afternoon, she's back now with her belongings
how should l know why she's here?
the real estate agent told me that Master Kim put out the house, and a new owner's moving in tomorrow
thank you
so what will you do?
l can't reach my friend in Suwon
and a motel is too scary
that's too bad
a really sexy college student used to live in our neighborhood
while l was writing a letter to her,
Chang-hyuk kicked the door open, and wanted to fight for her l asked him if he was crazy l suppose he liked that girl, too
you two must like the sexy type
so who won?
me, of course l was kind of good at taekwondo back then.
then two days later, both of them ran off together
women are so strange
why do they like that sleazy style?
guys like Chang-hyuk how would l put it...
makes girls nervous and uneasy, while also excited
and he makes you want to follow him till the end l met him by coincidence
was it in the park?
mister, you know how dirty this water is?
the city says it's clean but that's all a lie
didn't you see the paper?
you could die from drinking this
breathe in and out!
what a coincidence!
what brings you here?
l was reading the paper, and l felt like jogging suddenly
wait a minute!
the roof won't cave in so come sit down l just feel like standing l have to go home fast because of Master Kim
are you some kid?
will Master Kim give you a whipping?
he'll kill me
think l'm that crazy to jog everywhere like that?
stop it and come sit here
so what will you show me?
you're so mean lf you had sat down, that wouldn't have happened
so come sit l think l injured my back while jogging
lie down for a second
No!
l just wanted to brief you on my future plans, so lie down for a sec.
what's that?
you can see it better if you lie down l made a pledge with my brother l'm gonna buy that land and build a pension there
when the 5-day workweek comes, people will want to relax
they'll come in droves later l'll make sacks of money lsn't that enough?
enough for us to get hitched
why are you living like this?
like what?
you cook and do all his chores
that's a depressing lifestyle
what's bad about it?
hold on
this angle is art
run on this side
this isn't funny
hold on
amazing
your skin is so beautiful
who is it?
lt's me
what brings you here?
were you with a woman?
no way!
the time you spent to answer the door was just enough for a girl to hide ln the state we're in how could l see a woman?
wait a minute
would you like a beer?
great
here's my plan for getting the checks
take a look
this is a great idea
of course since it's my idea
what's that?
Oh, that?
when l finish this project, l'm gonna hide there quietly, and run a pension there
pension?
don't you have one of those by now?
at my age you need only three things
money, a belly and pride ls the bathroom this way?
mister Choi come by in the morning
let's have breakfast
sure
master Kim your sweety's hiding in here
you bastard l hate you!
so l got away safely that day lt could've been really bad
miss Seo
yes?
l don't mind you staying here
but could you not talk about Chang-hyuk?
you can sleep here
you're an AB blood type right?
Yes, right
you can eat what you like in the kitchen
just turn the lights on and off here lf you feel stuffy go out on the balcony here for some fresh air
when's your birthday?
february 5th
then Chang-hyuk's birthday l'm sorry l wasn't going to mention him
that's okay
he was born on December 23rd
have a good rest
you, too!
damn
what the hell happened in August?
okay l'm in for now
the game is over
you're all dead l got lots of time
you and Swallow teamed up but you don't know where he is?
captain, l know a bit about Kafka
Kafka?
what's that?
absurdity l'm friends with Swallow, but l don't know where he lives
you're really incredible
detective Kim
what's that girl's name who Swallow dated?
her name is Cho Kyung-nan
go find her
captain, you think he'd be with the girl he swindled?
buddha can't even predict relationships
go find her now! yes
be careful on the road
big Mouth
when did you start the drugs again?
didn't l tell you that life's absurd?
quitting is easy l've quit over 100 times
but when Chang-hyuk asked where to get some l said
Hey, boy
Hey, boy!
l said to Chang-hyuk
anything that's addictive can kill you
crack Mah-jong
marijuana Cocaine
horse racing l got it, pussy
what, pussy?
you said anything that's addictive
who are you calling a pussy?
wait, that's them isn't it?
hold on l thought you quit
so l was going to buy Chang-hyuk one stick
but now they don't sell just one
how much is a stick?
we sell five in a set
so if Chang-hyuk takes one, how many is there left?
you teaching me math boy?
l'm sorry There's four
what's life got to offer?
absurdity
okay, let's go
what's wrong with you?
what's wrong with what? Let's go!
now, turn around
Freeze!
don't move l told you all not to move
freeze
don't move!
think this is some joke you assholes?
think we're playing games?
open the safe!
open the safe now! There's nothing to take!
open it now!
you shot up, huh?
no
even when l was getting beaten down, l protected this safe
and thanks to our well-trained staff, who never made a mistake
sir
the bank supervisory team is waiting for you l'm proud of them
thank you for coming
how are you?
are you hurt anywhere?
the bank's safety comes first
at our bank
anyway we usually report this but since nothing was stolen, there's nothing to worry about
thank you very much 'bank check'
when you swindle if the victim is at the table, the game is over
the problem is getting that person to the table
but that's not everything
my job is absolutely crucial
right, you bastards?
listen carefully lf you separate at four-degrees, a spot will show lt's noticeable through a microscope
so you have to do it through line prints
print it out 11 degrees, and roll it with different colors.
11 degrees isn't easy
try analyzing the original, and work with 11 sheets of film
your eyes will pop out l'll poke your eyes out l said to shut the fuck up
let's go
how much did you lose?
don't know!
Hey! Hey!
a left turn and straight into the residential street
welcome lnstall the police radio in the car
shall we go inside the Bank of Korea?
after you show the deposit check, a staff will guide you
down the hall and past two doors is the safe
okay
don't drink today and go to bed early
tomorrow is payday
asshole thinks he's Mr Know-it-all
this will fool anybody 'Emergency Transport'
every bank has its own reserves
know what it is?
that's common sense
tell me
the law laid it out lf a customer wants to withdraw money, the bank can't run out, right?
so the bank must always have from 10 to 15 percent in cash
that's what it is
that's right lf the bank runs short of cash, the Bank of Korea provides them with it
everybody okay?
okay Okay
so the Bank of Korea gives out current deposit checks to each bank to make a withdrawal lf you present the checks at anytime, they will give you cash
and the account is settled at year-end
what we forged are those very checks
go get our money.
l just need to check l heard that you all are restructuring lately ls this true?
lt's possible that Moody's will change the sovereign credit rate within this month lf so, we could work around it l hope the restructuring goes well
everything is correct
last is to call the bank for confirmation
Yes, of course
Hello?
this is the Bank of Korea's issuance department ls the withdrawal amount 5 billion won?
5 billion won is correct 2 billion in cash and 3 billion in bonds

sorry
there were four Donnelly brothers.
Sean, Kevin, Jimmy, and Tommy
they had this thing for always getting into trouble, usually 'cause Jimmy did something stupid like stealing a truckload of Hawaiian shirts leaving Tommy to clean up the mess.
did I mention that Tommy had this thing for Jenny Riley?
???
Kevin had a huge gambling debt.
damn.
so Jimmy got the idea to kidnap an Italian.
to get back at the Donnellys, the Italians beat up Sean.
to get back at the Italians, Jimmy killed Louis.
at this point, Tommy went to see Huey, the head of the Irish mob, to try and fix things.
but that didn't work out.
so in order to protect his brother
Tommy got Jimmy arrested for the shirt thing.
then, Tommy and Kevin killed Sal, the head of the Italian mob and Huey, the aforementioned head of the Irish mob and hoped that, somehow, no one would notice.
me? I always wanted brothers like that.
Joey, I am your lawyer, okay?
you don't need to lie to me.
wait. Who's lying?
I'm an open book. What do you wanna know?
why I'm representing you.
cause I'm an innocent man.
I just--I hear things. I pick up things.
like that night, for example,
I wasn't there.
so there's no way I could actually know what happened.
and that was Tommy's plan, see, to keep his brothers safe by keeping that night a secret.
who?
I don't know. It's just a feeling.
so we should go back and be seen in order to make sure that nobody saw us?
you don't have to use sarcasm on me.
Kevin, nobody saw us.
what about the parking lot guy?
hat was five blocks away.
Yeah, but he nodded at me.
o we should kill him?
No! No, of course not.
is not gonna change what we did.
uns are loud.
people heard us.
and what if Sal and Huey told someone that Jimmy was coming?
if they were planning on killing Jimmy, that's not something you tell somebody.
Yeah, but these guys-- Shh! Kevin.
no one saw us and no one knows.
as long as you keep what happened between the two of us, no one's gonna know.
okay?
okay.
but it's like the old saying goes.
you mean if one of them is dead. That's the saying.
obviously, we come from different neighborhoods.
what if there are guys waiting for us back at the hospital?
just gimme the damn gun.
OK.
we went for coffee.
Hey, Sean.
for such a pretty boy, you sure are one tough son of a bitch.
Sean, this is important.
if anybody asks you what happened, you say you were mugged.
and you didn't see who did it.
can you hear me?
do you understand?
okay.
Hey.
you okay? Yeah.
we just went down for coffee.
Yeah.
you coat's wet.
Tommy, wait.
tell me what happened.
you can tell me. It's okay.
what happened?
just tell me.
it's okay.
however, not all of the Donnelly brothers were enjoying the evening quite as much.
answer the phone, answer the phone, answer the phone.
pick up the phone!
you gonna be all day?
am I gonna be alday?!
the doctor wants to see us.
????
and he should respond favorably to treatment.
we'll monitor him for the next 24 hours.
and we'll need to do additional tests to determine what the long-term effects of his injuries will be.
???
his injuries are severe.
we won't know for awhile if there's nerve damage and the majority of the breaks have fused
what are you saying?
my Jimmy's a cripple?
Helen, let the doctor talk.
Mrs. Donnelly, we're hopeful that your Jimmy will make a full recovery, but you have to be prepared for the fact that he may not walk again.
that day, Tommy made a deal.
he would pay whatever price God demanded, if He'd just let Jimmy walk again.
but for now, Sean is stable.
hopefully, we'll know more soon.
thank you.
we gotta slip out. -Go ahead.
where we going? -Shopping.
man!
Kim? You're still here?
did we hear anything from the doctor yet?
she says Sean's stable.
good.
Hey, listen. Kim.
the guys who attacked Sean, did you get a good look at 'em?
I could definitely describe one of them.
you know what would be good? -What?
it would be the best thing for Sean for you not to remember what those guys look like.
how would that be better?
you think I love my brother?
of course you do.
it would really be better for him, okay?
okay.
Thanks.
and, uh, don't let my mother scare you.
I'll be all right.
Tommy, I hate shopping.
a few feet.
which means you got blood on your clothes, whether you can see it or not.
so I'll change and burn them.
and when someone remembers what you were wearing...
and they ask you where those clothes are?
I thought you said no one was going to ask.
how much money you got?
a cole bucks.
how's he doing?
how do you think he's doing?
Thanks. -You are welcome.
make sure the sensors are at the bottom.
where the hell did you come up with this?
science class.
you see why you should pay attention?
Sal Minetta and Huey Farrell.
gee, you think there's gonna be any fallout from this?
I got a couple guys say they work here.
no kidding.
if you ask me, this isn't the brightest idea you've come up with.
Really?
what do you think was my best idea?
the very best?
the best you can think of.
squeezing Jimmy Donnelly till he whacked Sal.
that worked out pretty well, didn't it?
why don't you have a little faith?
morning, Detective.
Nicky Cottero, right?
Yeah, that's right, Detective.
I was, you know, wondering if you had any news.
you a reporter now, Nicky?
Oh, Sal.
you know, he was a beloved employer.
so understand all the staff is gonna be upset.
I was just wondering if you had something
I could pass on to them. No.
right now, I just have questions.
like what was the head of the Irish mob doing down here with all these Italians?
drinkin'.
watchin' porn. I couldn't tell ya.
so what brings you down here this early in the morning is a responsibility to brief the staff?
well, I'm the beverage manager.
people are gonna naturally look to me for answers.
well, why don't you go upstairs and think of some?
and then when I'm finished down here, you can fill me in too.
I'm glad to help.
this is, uh, this is a terrible crime.
Thanks. You guys are doing a great job.
cocky son of a bitch came down here to plant a flag.
meanwhile,
Huey's brother, Dokey, was also curious about who killed his brother...
and was asking some questions of his own.
so you don't know anything, huh?
you know anything now?
??
???
????
??
damn.
I'm telling you, Tommy.
Kevin, will you stop worrying?
it's gonna be okay.
I can see the ink.
are you wearing two jackets?
how do you mean?
you are!
I told you we had to get rid of what we were wearing.
Yeah, but it's my favorite one.
throw it out right now! Oh, man!
I'm going to class. You do what you normally do.
we gotta act like it's a regularay and nothing happened.
what are you staring at, Kevin?
dammit, Jimmy!
here you go, fellas. Thanks a lot.
it's coming right up, May, okay?
Hey! Hey, Pop. Who hasn't ordered?
everybody's good. I got you covered.
you just coming from the hospital now?
Yeah.
they kept that boy in overnight?
Yeah, he's still in ICU. It's terrible.
Yeah.
yeah?
I hate to see anyone get hurt.
pop, just leave it for once.
there's just two sides to every story.
there's two sides to Sean being beaten so hard he might have brain damage?
what's the second side to that, Dad?
well, you don't give somebody a beatin' like that unless you got a reason.
are you good here? Because I'm gonna take a walk.
Jenny, listen to me, please.
I know you like Tommy.
and I don't think he's a bad kid.
it's just that
it's like something is in their blood.
and no matter how hard they try to do good, that blood is always gonna seep through.
and it poisons whatever it touches.
gosh, Dad.
why didn't you ever tell me you felt this way?
come on, Jenny!
you wonder why we have to keep buying new stools.
I should've known Jimmy was too messed up to take care of anything.
now we have to get rid of a body in broad daylight.
okay, so we'll wait till tonight.
Yeah, you're right, Kevin.
cause the smell of a rotten body is not gonna attract any attention.
let's wait. Again with the sarcasm.
I'm getting sick of it, Tommy!
I mean, how could he just dump it there?
what the hell is he thinking?
come on, where would you put it?
not in the dumpster behind our bar, Kevin.
okay, so where? I don't know.
how many bodies you get rid of before?
okay, what about the landfill?
I mean, we could sneak in, put him under some garbage, they bury him for us.
the landfill in, uh, Staten Island? Yeah.
so what, we just take a ferry?
just the three of us?
okay, we stuff him in a furnace.
our furnace?
no, of course not. Somebody else's.
Oh, you know someone with a furnace large enough for a body?
well, I'd have to think about it.
how about a tub full of acid?
Kevin, stop making suggestions. You're really freaking me out.
okay, we can bury him.
you know a place in the citywe can bu Jersey.
I know a place. [telephone ringing]
Hello?
where the hell have you been? Jimmy!
I been calling since 7: 00!
you should be down here to bail me out!
I don't know.
what, now it's my fault that I got arrested?!
you know, it's real smart, Tommy, talking about this on the phone.
just get down here and bail me!
not gonna do it. What do you mean?
I'm not arguing with you anymore.
you want to talk to somebody, you can talk to Kevin.
why me? Hey, Jimmy.
we're not gonna do it!
Kevin, listen to me.
there's a bag under the bar... from Sal.
you know what bag I'm talking about?
hold on.
where under the bar?
it's under the taps, I think.
this place is disgusting.
sorry. You know what? Stop looking.
I don't want you to get dirty.
why is everyone using sarcasm on me today?
okay, I got it.
just get down here and get me out.
wait, Jimmy, wait, wait! What?
if I took this to the track first,
I could double it.
you gamble a penny of that, I'm gonna bite your thumbs off.
you coming?
where you going? Nowhere.
what's in that bag? Nothing.
Hey! hey!
this is ransom money.
you think? Give it back, Tommy.
Hey! Give it back!
what the hell's wrong with you?
you think you can just bail Jimmy out
you wanna forget the fact he shot Louie?
Yeah, how many people did we shoot last night?
because of Jimmy!
I'm not gonna argue with you, either.
we don't have enough time because we gotta go clean up another one of Jimmy's messes.
look, there's 30 grand in there. We can bail Jimmy out with 5.
you don't get it, do you?
we're screwed here.
let's go.
wait!
how do you know any of this?
Oh.
well, maybe that particular time I was there.
Hey, you guys take off. I'll watch everything.
where the hell did you come from?
what? I been here the whole time.
don't worry. Mum's the word.
[clicking sound] Lips are sealed.
you pay for that beer?
probably.
Tommy. Ponycar.
we're not going for a joy ride, Kevin.
get in. I'll grab him on this end.
you get in.
I'm driving.
what's that got to do with anything?
you don't get in, I don't drive.
let's go!
Damn! The stench of him.
I feel like it's in my skin. Drive faster.
and get stopped for a ticket? Smart.
you lock the door at the back of the bar?
while you were berating me or while I was digging a corpse out of the dumpster?
that's sarcasm, isn't it?
don't make me laugh! I'm pissed at you!
you're pissed at me?
damn straight!
are you sure we're going in the right direction?
I'm sure.
how do you know about this place?
Jake Macey.
sed to steal cars and drag race out here.
it's right by a swamp.
no one around for miles. It's perfect.
this is it?
Yeah.
this is the abandoned swamp with no one around for miles and miles.
last time I was here. Yeah.
it's not like you had a better plan.
yeah? Now who's stupid, huh?
couldn't get a bigger barrel?
they don't make bigger barrels.
come on.
what are you doing?!
he's alive.
Where'd you get that?
how many guns did Jimmy have at the bar, huh?
come on. Grab his legs again.
No! Not until I know he's dead.
he's dead!
that was just gas escaping from his body.
then why'd you jump? Because you did!
Yeah.
we needed holes in the barrel anyway.
come on.
it's not gonna work.
stay outta sight. I'll be right back.
Hey!
wait, hey!
whoa. Whoa, whoa.
what's that for?
strip down.
what?
take off your clothes, Kev.
hold his ankles.
do it, Kevin.
come on, Kevin.
I can't.
Hello?
sorry.
I'm sorry I couldn't help over there.
I don't know what happened to me.
it's just like... I started shaking...
and everything went dark.
not now, Kevin.
please just
just shut the hell up.
did you take anything out of that bag?
no.
what are you doing?
counting the money.
we gotta get outta here!
you don't believe me, why do you even ask, huh?
I wanna see if you were lying to me.
all right, fine! I took some money, okay?
but only enough to bail Jimmy out.
what a great idea.
I turn myself inside out to get him into jail and rehab so that he won't be killed or kill himself, and you are gonna bail him out?
we're his brothers!
he's sick. He needs us.
I'm helping him.
no one gets help in there!
if you'd ever been in there, you'd know that.
gimme the money, Kevin. It's not your money, all right?
it was Jimmy's idea. You didn't want any part of it.
gimme the money. No!
I'm keeping it, all right?
it's my cut. I can do with it what I want.
there is no cut.
don't younderstand that?
this is ransom money and the Italians know who they paid it to.
you want a chance at living, we gotta give it back.
give it back, Tommy?
this is part of your big plan to make everything right?
Tommy, Louie is dead.
if they wanna kill us for that, giving them back the money is not gonna change anything.
nobody knows Louie's dead.
the only people who knew were Huey and Sal.
so what, they're gonna think he went on vacation?
nobody's gonna care.
what they're gonna care about is that money.
we're giving it back.
you give the money back, they're gonna blow your brains out.
then they're gonna come looking for the rest of us.
where is it? Keep your hands off me.
do it again, Tommy, I swear to God.
what are you gonna do, hmm?
go ahead, Kevin.
you're right.
I'm the one trying to hurt Jimmy.
shoot me.
pull the trigger. Come on, Kevin.
pull the trigger.
get up.
get out here, Kevin.
here?
Yeah...go home.
you been up for two days. Get some sleep.
you coming?
get out, Kevin.
not gonna need it.
go home.
I'll be there in a couple hours.
no, you won't.
Thanks, honey. Sure.
whenever I watch my boy sleeping,
I still see them as five years old in my head.
does that sound crazy?
always five.
well, they're not babies anymore, but they're not little men either.
I'm so sorry this happened.
thanks for hanging in with me.
I know it's not easy watching people suffer.
no, it's not.
do you know...
what happened last night?
how do you mean?
you know what I mean.
I think...
that if you know someone's good, you know it in your belly.
then you trust that if they had to do something, they had no other choice.
we're closed.
I'm here to see Nicky Cottero.
someone's here for Nicky.
it's Tommy Donnelly.
okay.
the stairs in the back.
this way? Yeah.
Thanks.
what the hell are you doing here?
I'm too tired to sleep.
stay put.
whatever you say.
I mean it. I'll be back in a minute.
I'll be here.
anything happens...
I'll be here.
come in.
take a seat.
you want a drink?
no.
no, thanks.
um, I heard about Sal. I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's a real loss.
you here to pay your respects?
I'm here with some unfinished business.
my brother Jimmy kidnapped Louie downtown.
my brother's a junkie.
never thinks things through.
so I took him to rehab and I let Louie go...
in hopes that it would end things.
I don't want any bad blood.
there's $30, 000 in there.
with Sal gone, I assume it belongs to you.
Where's Louie?
don't know.
like I said, I let him go.
every day Louie's missing, I lose money.
tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna accept this money in good faith.
I appreciate it.
but I need you to pay me $1, 000 a week until Louie gets back...
for disruption of business.
you understand?
that money makes us even.
you got a lost bookie, that'syourproblem.
I'll see you around.
Hey, kid!
tell your brother Jimmy
I'm gonna be seeing him real soon.
that'd be great.
he'd enjoy the visitor.
didn't you here? Jimmy was arrested yesterday.
he's been in jail.
and one more time.
???
Oh, yeah. You I was there too. e...
how'd it go?
like it went.
what the hell's Joey Ice Cream doing here?
I have no idea.
we were that tight.
they never took a step without me.
remember when I said how, as a kid, Tommy Donnelly tried to make that deal?
well, God didn't hear him right away.
so Tommy kept going back.
kept trying to get God's attention...
until he finally listened.
your mom's looking for you.
the doctor said Jimmy's gonna walk.
only thing is, Tommy never negotiated the price.
I should've just told you last night.
I love you.
you got customers waiting?
glad you came by.
Yeah, me too.
because I wanted to tell you that I can't.
can't what?
do this.
be with you.
I really am sorry.
Wait...Jenny.
if you want breakfast, come on down.
there was no way for him to know way back then that God was gonna take away the one thing Tommy wanted most.
but that's what life is like. Am I right?
when one door closes, another window opens.
Tommy, get in.
if you don't mind, I'd just like to walk.
put him in the trunk.
I'm getting in.
I guess you heard somebody shot my brother to death.
Yeah, I heard. I'm really sorry.
I can understand someone wanting to kill Huey.
he had enemies.
who doesn't, right?
I just can't figure out what he was doing in Sal Minetta's basement.
he didn't tell anyone?
I mean, the last thing anybody knows he went to visit you and your brother at the hospital.
he brought you the pie his wife made.
Yeah, he came by.
he was checking on Sean.
I heard that, uh, Sean took quite a beating.
is he okay?
he's gonna be okay.
that's good.
that's good you still got your brother.
did Huey say anything to you before he left the hospital?
where he was going...anything?
I wish I could tell you more.
me too.
all right. Get outta here.
Hey.
you hear anything...
I'll let you know.
okay.
（FBI HIGH VALUE BETAINEE SITE LOCATION UNKNOWN)
you ready?
well, now, that's a stupid question.
monday, 9: 07 A. M. examiner Hatch.
subject... Elizabeth Scott Keen.
here we go.
before Monday of last week, did you have, or have you ever had, - personal contact with Raymond Reddington? - No.
did Reddington notify you before he surrendered himself to the FBI?
no. Have you ever been convicted of a crime?
convicted? Not yet.
please answer "yes" or "no. " Have you ever been convicted of a crime?
you're wasting valuable time.
does Elizabeth Keen know why you surrendered yourself?
he's telling our people he wants immunity, that he's willing to cooperate, give us names.
what names? - He's got a list, alleges he can deliver us high-value criminal targets if the justice department grants him immunity.
what's his legal status?
the man sold secrets to the Hofstad network, to the Syrians.
he's not getting immunity. Talk to me about containment.
who knows we've got him?
including us in this room... A total of 26 people.
remember, he's been off the grid for over 20 years.
yet he seems to know things even you don't. About this, uh, Elizabeth Keen...
says her father has some kind of criminal record?
Yes. - Before Monday of last week, did you have, or have you ever had, personal contact with Elizabeth Keen?
no.
he's lying.
does Raymond Reddington know, or has he ever known, your husband?
his name's tom Keen. Schoolteacher, 4th grade.
he's currently in a medically induced coma, was nearly killed last week during an altercation on a case Keen was working. He gonna survive?
the situation is uncertain.
you're confident that the husband's not involved with Reddington?
no.
the truth is we don't have any idea who Reddington may be involved with.
then why should we trust him? You're asking the wrong questions.
I'm trying to help you with a matter of some urgency.
it's your choice whether you listen to me or not, but there will be an incident at 11: 00 this morning at the decatur industrial park.
I would send ambulances. We need to move quickly.
he's a prisoner. He has no legal position to negotiate from.
charge him under the patriot act.
see what he has to say then. He'll only speak with Keen.
it's not up to him. We decide who he speaks...
I don't think you understand how delicately the situation needs to be handled.
Reddington has brokered some of the most comprehensive international criminal activity in the past 20 years.
he has access to targets we don't even know exist.
now, he's telling us there may be some kind of an event about to happen at the decatur industrial park.
I don't think you understand.
you don't run the criminal division of main justice. I do.
the Attorney General is not going to accept a deal.
Reddington is a criminal, and we're gonna take credit for catching him.
our office will lay out the charges.
I hope you understand that from time t...
there is... No... Deal.
am I clear?
Yes.
and have you been truthful to the best of your knowledge?
so, what do we got?
swept the entire yard.
got multiple teams working the property, k-9 units.
nothing. I mean, look around.
I got two city blocks of hiding places, and I don't even know what the hell
I'm supposed to be looking for.
I need more information. What's the specific tip?
who did it come from? We got an informant who's dicking us around.
says we're gonna need rescue units here at 11: 00.
it's already 11: 20. Give it another 20 minutes and wrap it up.
I want bomb squads, medics. I want everybody out.
we've got a problem.
a passenger train just blew through.
come again? What was that?
I said you have a passenger train coming in your direction.
it's over speed.
clear the area. Get everyone out.
clear! Clear out!
get your men out of here! Clear!
those things I found under the floor, they're not yours, right?
he put them there...
the gun and the passports.
tell me Reddington did this, and not...
I wish you were here so you could explain yourself.
60 people have been confirmed dead and dozens injured after a passenger train derailed this morning at the decatur industrial park.
60 people are dead because of you.
60 people are dead because you don't return my calls, Harold.
if you want to save lives and catch the bad guys, pay attention.
they're not going to make your deal. That's unfortunate.
the next name on my list is an absolute snake.
the train. How did you know?
I know lots of things. But the train I didn't.
I knew the time, the place, but the train was a big surprise.
we've ruled out terrorism.
look at the list of casualties, Harold.
you'll find some councilwoman from Albany.
apparently she's been tangling with some rather cunning, powerful people.
you're saying the derailment was an assassination?
I'm not saying anything...
unless it's to Elizabeth Keen.
tell me about the train wreck.
if you had any idea how far I've traveled to see you again, lizzy.
my name's "Liz," not "lizzy. " To you, I'm agent Keen.
now, I've heard all your demands, but I don't think you've heard mine, so let me tell you how this is gonna work.
I ask the questions, you answer them.
screw with me, and I walk.
understood?
how is tom?
they're never gonna give you immunity.
not a chance.
Oh, I think they will.
otherwise, what am I doing here?
I'm perfectly happy to go back to the boat.
tell me about the train wreck.
what would you like to know?
everything.
the train accident was no accident. You know that.
but what you don't know is the man behind it...
is quite prolific.
he's responsible for a slew of other premeditated killings just like this one, disguised as accidents.
shall I go on?
a building collapses in moscow, a ferry capsizes on the brahmaputra river.
these are the events we've come to expect on the evening news.
but in truth, there's always more to the story.
hidden between the facts and figures, the victims and the heroes, there's always a murder.
the work of a man who disguises his killings in the headlines of everyday tragedies.
what proof do you have?
his work is difficult to detect, but the victims are there.
an appellate court judge in Ohio, a French diplomat who dies in a plane crash.
look closer. The pattern will emerge.
over the last seven years, more than 3, 000 innocent civilians have died, all collateral victims as a result of this man's unique methods.
in the 20-odd years I've been working my side of the tracks,
I have not encountered another contractor who's had as significant an impact on the civilian population as he.
he's rivaled only by governments and terrorist organizations.
and you've never heard of him.
I have it on good authority that his next contract will take him to New York.
this is not an opportunity to ponder or deliberate, because once he's done, he's gone.
this guy have a name?
they call him "the freelancer.
and how do we find him?
you don't find him. I do. What, are you two pen pals?
you guys send each other, uh, coded e-mails?
I don't have e-mail or a phone or... An address.
I prefer to handle my business face-to-face.
you've met him. Once.
I brokered a few jobs.
he works through an intermediary.
he might be for sale.
perhaps I should set a meeting.
maybe you should. You should come.
just the two of us... no wires, no clumsy agents in the bushes.
you want me to make an introduction, you need to trust me with my source.
Ah! What fun! You'll need a dress.
and where would this meeting be?
Montreal.
what do you know about the passports?
what passports?
you know what I'm talking about.
as far as I'm concerned, you put them there.
put what, lizzy?
the box. The money and the gun. The passports.
who else have you told?
what? Nobody.
have you told Cooper? No.
I want you to shadow Reddington to Montreal.
contact our people in the royal Canadian mounted police.
I want complete surveillance.
take them both down... Reddington and his liaison.
if you go to the police, they'll file charges.
if the gun's not registered, it's a felony.
the passports are 25 years each.
on the other hand, if you confront him, what good does that do?
he'll deny everything, and you'll continue to doubt him.
either way, it's...
an impossible situation.
before we do this, let me be clear...
I'm not here to socialize.
I have no interest in having dinner with you, nor do we have the time.
we meet your contact, we get the name of the freelancer's next victim, and we go. Understood?
I agree with you completely.
but it is a restaurant, and it is dinnertime.
so, what does this liaison look like?
let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Bonsoir. Sa va?
anyone asks, you're my girlfriend from Ann arbor.
absolutely not.
fine. You can be my daughter.
Bonsoir.
what would you like to drink?
I'll have wine. Chardonnay?
s'il vous pla? t, pour madame, un cocktail de I'aviation.
this one. Here. Bring that up.
running facial recognition now.
no hits off the database yet.
Ahh. Oh, this isn't what I ordered.
Merci.
to the future.
aviation cocktail.
Uh-huh? It's from the '20s.
tastes like spring, doesn't it?
tell me about your job.
the profiling.
I'm fascinated.
how close to the truth do you think you can really get?
Where's your contact?
tell me my profile.
why would I do that?
you've heard the debriefs.
you've read Ressler's book reports.
I so want to know how you... See things.
you're a loner. You keep your distance.
you travel freely through foreign lands.
you're rootless.
you're very comfortable here with your glass of scotch, but you're just as comfortable sleeping in a cave with rebels or sharing dinner in some hole-in-the-wall noodle shop.
your closest friends are strangers.
you understand that tight bonds can make you vulnerable, so you're careful not to have any.
and that's why you're so conflicted about me.
you need me.
and you hate that about yourself, because it makes you vulnerable.
tell me about your husband.
does he know you as well as you know him?
your contact is late.
does he know about you as a child?
it's been 35 minutes.
does he know about the fire?
why am I so important to you?
did you know my parents?
I asked you a question.
Oui, monsieur?
s'il vous pla? t, apportez-nous une bouteille quatre vingt deux chateau latour.
Bonsoir.
are you gonna keep trying to impress me with your knowledge of French wine, or are you gonna answer my question?
what if I were to tell you...
that all the things you've come to believe about yourself are a lie?
please excuse me for a moment.
what did Reddington give you?! Tip!
do you understand English?! Yes!
what the hell was that? You sold him out. You let him go.
I let him go?! Who notified rcmp?!
you compromised an asset.
he's number 4 on the most wanted list, Keen. What did you expect?!
and now he's gone because of you!
Hey, there, guys.
you planned this! You knew he would never show!
take a breath, agent Ressler.
you think I'm gonna fly all the way to Montreal for the cheese cart?
my contact was the first person I saw when I walked into the place.
I told you he would help, and he did.
the coat-check attendant.
I left payment in my hat.
in exchange, he left a photo of the assassin's next victim.
the human-rights activist? There you have it...
a solid lead delivered exactly as promised.
find Floriana Campo, you find the freelancer.
not bad for a day's work. Let's celebrate.
Hey, Donald. How 'bout that cheese cart?
Donald Ressler. Elizabeth Keen. FBI.
we need to have a word with you.
we have reason to believe someone's planning an assassination attempt on your life.
tonight's fundraiser needs to be canceled. Oh, it can't be canceled.
it's a donor event, and I have my own security.
it's too risky. We can't guarantee your safety.
nobody can guarantee my safety.
I have many enemies... traffickers, cartels.
we know what they did to your husband, what you've gone through.
your work, it's been an inspiration.
I wrote my senior thesis on your time in Kuala Lumpur.
I was going through a very bad time.
and in some ways, I think you helped me through it.
do you have children, agent Keen?
uh, Elizabeth.
and... If all goes well...
there is no work more meaningful than being a mother.
I didn't have kids of my own. This is my one regret.
but these girls that I'm trying to protect, they are my family.
tonight is for them. I won't cancel.
look, we can't force you to accept our protection, but we need your help to find the man contracted to kill you.
to identify him, to capture him, we need you to cooperate... you're our only link.
will you help us?
she spent 15 years with the u. N. stationed primarily in eastern Europe with small stints in north Africa.
in 2000, she helped pass the trafficking victims protection act.
since that time, her nonprofit has raised over $35 million in her campaign to eliminate human and sex trafficking around the globe.
three years ago, her husband was murdered by the Eberhardt cartel.
Eberhardt is the most ruthless human-trafficking cartel in Europe.
2008, their founder was killed leaving a power vacuum.
to this day, nobody knows who's actually running the outfit.
what we do know is that he's merciless.
murdered rival cartel leaders to expand his reach.
survivors tell stories of torture and forced addiction.
he killed Floriana Campo's husband, and he most likely hired the freelancer to kill her.
we're doing everything we can to disrupt the freelancer's plan.
we've changed schedules, travel routes.
and you've moved tomorrow night's event?
Yes, based on what we know about the freelancer, he takes months to plan these attacks.
if he had something planned for tomorrow, he's gonna need to pass through our security in order to pull it off.
what good does that do if nobody knows what he looks like?
I need your help.
you said you've seen this guy once.
we're compiling photos of the people who are scheduled to attend the event tomorrow, and...
please understand
I want more than anything to help you.
it's the reason why I'm here.
but I won't say another word until the terms of my deal are met.
I'm so sorry to bother you with these trivial details, but it's a simple yes or no.
no.
his lawyers drafted this? No. He did.
Reddington represents himself in legal matters.
a DARPA-tested, fully encrypted, 8- millimeter tag?
I don't even know what that is.
it's a tracking device.
and what's this about his "private security detail"?
he's given us a list of five names, wants us to pick two.
which are the two least offensive?
Ex-freedom fighter from South Sudan.
sources indicate he's Reddington's former bodyguard, goes by the name of "Dembe.
does Dembe have a last name?
no, ma'am. Just Dembe. Like prince or Madonna.
the second is Luli Zeng. Phd in economics from Stanford.
dodged federal prison twice.
s. E.C. Says she's untouchable.
we think she's moving Reddington's money.
how would I justify this?
you don't. It's off the books.
and he's what...
our informant, slowly working his way towards immunity?
which he's never going to get.
we have a chance to catch a mass murderer.
one condition... you bring in somebody I know and trust.
meera Malik, CIA.
she can help navigate international waters.
fine.
one day, you and I will be talking about this moment in front of a senate hearing.
God help us.
you got your deal. Our turn now.
compiled a list of the attendees for tonight's event.
is this really the right approach?
Hey. I'm right here. Talk to me.
honestly, is this how the FBI does things...
comb through the invitation list?
this guy didn't rsvp. I've seen the man.
if he shows up tonight, if you're going to have any hope of identifying him, you need to put me in that room.
so, you want to go to the party? Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
Luli, my dear.
watch yourself with her, Donald.
she hates men, and cops most of all.
you, I don't know. Meera Malik.
you look like the CIA.
Oh, yeah? What's the CIA look like?
attractive but treacherous. I guess we'll find out.
this is gonna be a gas.
so you know, the way this works, we don't typically drink on the job.
no, thank you.
your 7: 00?
no.
Where's that woman with the mushroom puffs?
you okay?
Oh, yes. I'm fine. A wonderful evening.
what's wrong?
I just got word that a shipment we were trying to track has gone missing. Shipment?
girls, more than 60 of them.
where? There must be something the bureau can do.
Oh, it's too late. They're gone.
ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention.
my name is Anya Kedrov.
I've been asked to say a few words.
I spent three years of my life in a 9'x9' room living in hell, forcibly addicted.
for all I survived, I still carry a daily reminder.
the people who took me, the Eberhardt cartel, they brand their servants by carving their symbol into the flesh on our backs.
but as bad as I had it, there is always someone who had it worse.
truth is, it's only through acknowledging and claiming these experiences that we can really put a face on the crime that is human sex trafficking.
tonight, I'd simply like to say thank you.
thank you, Floriana.
Oh, thank you, Anya.
and thank you for coming tonight.
I'm sure you've noticed we're not at the met.
we had to relocate for security reasons.
each one of you could have stayed home, succumbed to fear.
but you didn't.
you came. You're here.
you, I, Anya stand here in solidarity...
with the people who cannot be here with us...
yet.
it's him.
what?
the waiter.
the freelancer. I remember two years ago - my late husband was in South Sudan. - Clear the area.
now.
we saw a boy...
stop! FBI!
federal agent! - Clear the pool area!
it's the waiter! He's heading towards the stairs!
stop!
watch out!
close the door!
we're heading east! I repeat, heading east on 59th!
he's heading across town toward 63rd!
FBI. Out of the car.
I'm heading in your direction. Give me an update.
200 west 57th. He's gonna be coming out the back.
my leg.
I need an ambulance. Well, I need names.
tell me about the Eberhardt cartel.
I don't know what you're talking about.
who's in charge of the cartel?
who hired you to take out Campo?
sweep the floor. Lock it down.
we're all clear inside.
he asked you a question.
I can't. Last time. Who hired you?
No!
my friend here is with the FBI.
I'm from the CIA you know the difference, don't you?
now, we haven't got much time because you have a compound fracture and you're bleeding internally, so we're going to expedite things.
I can't.
a name.
he hired me.
thank you. For everything.
don't leave your suite.
it was Reddington. He hired the freelancer.
what? No. How could he?
the coat-check attendant. Think about it.
the coat check didn't leave the picture in red's hat.
red left it for him. He was signaling the hit.
Why?
couldn't get close enough to do it himself.
I have my own security. So, you want to go to the party?
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
it's him, the waiter. Pointing out the freelancer was a diversion.
he wanted us to empty that party. He wanted to get her alone.
how did you get in here? Where's my security?
your security is occupied.
this is because of you. The threats, the FBI.
the FBI works for me now.
why are you doing this, Raymond?
I offered to make you a partner.
my people came to you about the shipping routes.
you turned us down. I've never liked you.
you never liked me because you're a wanted man living in the shadows, and I am not.
I run my business, and I'm being wined and dined by the city's elite.
I don't know how you do it...
the duplicity.
how does the devil in you contend with the angel?
I would have kicked her out years ago.
you can learn a thing or two from me, Raymond.
I'm going to kiss that sweet, young FBI agent on the cheek and say, "good night,
and then go down to docks and pick up my next shipment of girls.
Hey! Where's my agents?!
get out of my way.
Oh, Elizabeth! Thank God you're here!
this is the man. He's the one who wants me dead.
you hired the freelancer. To do what?
was it the champagne? What's the headline gonna read?
italian dog born with two heads.
no?
how about "humanitarian, exposed as fraud, commits suicide"?
what have you done?
I didn't do anything.
I think the assassin may have slipped her a lethal cocktail of the same barbiturates she uses to drug her children.
what are you saying? She's not the woman you think she is.
you're a liar.
who's lying, Floriana? Shut up, Raymond!
Ooh, that was a mistake.
you know him?
everybody knows this son of a bitch!
I need a medic!
you don't need a medic. I have the antidote right here.
give it to me! I'd be happy to, as soon as she admits the truth.
give it to me now! She's not breathing! Tell her the truth, Floriana.
this will help you breathe.
madam Campo doesn't free children from slavery.
she imprisons them.
I don't believe you. Don't be so naive.
Floriana Campo is the largest distributor of enslaved children in the eastern hemisphere.
her foundation is a front to launder the profits of the Eberhardt cartel, which she runs.
she's been eliminating the competition.
good God. The woman had her own husband murdered.
give me the antidote.
all you have to do is tell her, Floriana. A simple nod will suffice.
what is with you in hotel rooms and pens in people's necks?
what's happening?
looks like she's dying.
definitely dying.
you look tired.
go home. Get some sleep.
unless you're avoiding your home.
what would you have done if the antidote had worked on time?
it would have exposed you as our informant.
there was no antidote.
we've confirmed that Floriana Campo was running a fortune through the kowloon bank.
you were right.
the woman ran the Eberhardt cartel.
based on the information you gave us, we were able to intercept the shipment and rescue the girls.
she preyed on the weak and the innocent while dressed in the wings of a savior.
I detested everything about her.
I had no idea.
I mean, I just...
I should have known.
we never really know anyone, do we?
what are you gonna do, lizzy?
about this situation with tom?
it seems you have two options.
either you turn him in or confront him.
or perhaps there's a third option.
Oh, my God.
tell us a little about Elizabeth.
Elizabeth? Uh, to me, she's always just been lizzy.
uh, I remember the first time she brought up adoption before we ever thought about coming to see you guys.
she was... she was so nervous.
she tried to cook dinner, which was a complete disaster, because she's, uh, not the best cook.
I think it was around my third bite of cold spaghetti, she just started to cry.
I, uh... I don't know.
I think she was afraid of disappointing me.
but she looked me in the eye, a- and she told me the truth...
that she didn't want to have a biological child, not with so many children in need of a loving family.
she wanted to adopt.
it was important to her.
in that moment, I just...
I- I don't think I've ever loved her more.
she's... she's gonna be a great mom.
I mean, she really is.
I know that.
what's going on? You're acting funny.
nothing. - Okay.
tell me.
tell me.
I need to ask you about something, and I need you to tell me the truth.
of course. What is it?
I don't get it.
a man was shot and killed in that hotel.
okay.
so, what's the question?
were you involved?
I-in... in what?
the murder.
you're not going anywhere.
Liz. Stop!
the people that I work for are very powerful.
now, I need you to tell me everything that you know.
I don't know anything. You're hurting me!
damn it, Lizzy! Do not lie to me!
I don't know anything! I swear!
Yeah, well, I wish that I believed you!
rise and shine.
the day is waiting. Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Oh, God. I hate you right now.
do you? Wake up, wake up, wake up. Get her, Hudson! Get her!
stop it, both of you!
Ouch!
I know that you've had a rough few nights, but today is gonna be a really great day.
Why? - Well, I have a doctor's appointment.
you hate doctors. - Yeah, but it's not for me.
It's...an ultrasound for our baby.
I thought Jeni was having second thoughts.
Yeah, she said we're the only married couple she knows who don't totally hate each other, so she's... she's giving us a baby.
that's... That's great news. - It's amazing!
when you get home from work tonight, you are finally gonna see what this little monster looks like.
wait. I'm not invited?
I just know how busy you get. But call if you can't make it.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
it's so good to see things finally getting back to normal around here.
my name is... is... My n... My name is Seth... Seth Nelson.
P-p-p-please, please... I'm begging you. D-don't...
why are you doing this?
save your breath, kid.
please, don't do this. Please...Don't!
what... What are you?
you got... You got the wrong guy! Please!
help me! Somebody!
your sources were correct, sir.
the Iranian is attempting to procure a high-level-intelligence package.
we believe it could lead to the answer you seek.
have it intercepted.
that may prove...difficult.
the seller hired the Courier to make the exchange.
the last time we attempted to intercept him...
I'm well aware of the men and resources we lost in Cairo.
perhaps this is an opportunity to let our new...friends at the FBI carry the water.
I've been ordered to include you in the oversight committee brief on Reddington next week.
Cooper told me.
here's the profile I prepared on him.
have I told you yet I don't place much stock in profiling?
and by "much," I mean "none." It's never once helped me solve a case.
you know what has? - Hm?
facts. - Yeah.
I also prepared a profile on you.
uptight, fueled by an inner rage, "capable of the occasional moment of tenderness, "which likely brings on the desire to stay up all night watching Asian porn.
not even close.
how about this?
you don't trust me.
you think I'm tainted somehow... Maybe a traitor.
you resent the fact that Reddington wants to work directly with me instead of you.
speak of the devil... It's the devil.
what is this place?
something of a hideaway.
it used to be home to one of the finest American writers who ever lived...
fredrick Hemstead. - Never heard of him.
no, you haven't. Nobody has.
dear Fredrick was waiting tables when we first met...
strange little man, built like a fireplug.
he was living here with his mother until she died.
poor Fredrick couldn't afford to stay on, so I bought the place for him.
please.
sadly, Fredrick died without ever being published, but this place is chock-full of his work...
manuscripts, poems, unsent letters, and lots and lots of this.
what is that?
no earthly idea.
some sort of distilled alcohol, I think.
there's bottles of the stuff stashed everywhere.
would you like me to pour you a few fingers?
why am I here?
they replace trust with fear and the threat of violence.
the next target on the blacklist is a physical embodiment of both.
he's known as the Courier, and his involvement in a transaction virtually guarantees success.
once he's hired to make a delivery, he can't be bribed, he can't be stopped.
if either a party attempts to double-cross the other, he kills them both.
the perfect middleman for an imperfect world.
Cooper's not gonna sanction a black op against the U. P.S. driver of crime.
at that price, it could be anything from a genetically engineered virus to a very important person's head in a bag.
does he have a name?
I'm sure he does. I don't know it.
skip to the part where you tell me how you expect us to find him.
I know the man he's planning on delivering the package to...
an Iranian spy named Hamid Soroush.
where are they making the exchange?
at the Winston farmer's market in... 2 hours and 45 minutes.
my 1: 00?
could be him.
same height, right age.
you reading me, Haircut? - Stay on him.
when it rings, pick it up.
he just gave him something.
it's a cell. He's moving.
what's he saying?
I don't know. We've got nothing.
get someone to point a mike at this guy.
he's off.
excuse me. Can you break a $100?
I think he just made contact.
all teams start casually moving to the east side of the market.
do not spook this guy.
chang, get closer on the produce guy's face.
I think he made us.
tactical teams, you're up. I want south side sealed off from the outside.
just made contact.
shots fired! Soroush is down! I don't have eyes on the shooter!
all teams, move in now.
you hit? - It's not my blood.
suspect's heading north on 6th.
I need local air and law-enforcement support now.
keys! Give me the keys! Give me the damn keys!
air support on the way. Engage... Two minutes.
cut him off at the next intersection!
do it.
we're at the corner of 10th and Spencer.
the Courier's vehicle has been disabled.
move and you're dead.
put your other hand up.
get your hands up! - Put it up now.
put your arm up now. - I can't.
put your other arm up.
Oh, my God.
let's try this again.
what were you supposed to deliver?
please. Help us, and maybe we can help you.
what about that Iranian spy whose head you exploded all over my partner?
huh? You remember him?
he had banking codes with a $20 million wire transfer in his pocket.
you're a courier. You were supposed to give a package to the Iranian.
Where's the package?!
we found nothing at the farmer's market, nothing in his vehicle, nothing on him.
what was he supposed to be delivering? - I don't know, Harold.
might it be conceivable your people actually missed something?
you're not telling us everything.
let me put your mind at ease. I'm never telling you everything.
I did my job here. I gave you a Blacklister.
there he sits.
obviously, good copbad cop isn't working here, so let's try bad copworse cop.
how's the arm?
looks painful.
Where's the package?!
smile all you want.
we're just getting started, pal.
why did he kill Soroush?
obviously, he spotted one of your agents, and poor Soroush paid the price.
there's a knife wound in his chest, scars all over his body.
you know how he got them?
that's interesting.
I always wondered if the stories were true.
no, we'll just stick him in some hole.
I think you may need to call a doctor.
I've read about cases like this.
your suspect has congenital anhidrosis.
it's a rare genetic disorder.
he can't feel physical pain.
that makes sense. - And the scarring?
people with the disorder obviously get injured more often, but not... not like that.
that... That's something else entirely.
we're more interested in the knife wound in his chest.
we think he might have placed evidence...
inside of it.
what evidence? - We're not sure.
we got a hit when we ran his name and face through the DMV servers.
my name... My name... My name is Seth... Is Seth Nelson.
w-why are you doing this? Please...
that's the only thing on the chip taken from his chest?
newspaper's from yesterday.
time stamp on the video file is 4: 29 this morning.
it's a proof-of-life video.
the oxygen mask, the tanks... Wherever this guy is, his hours are numbered.
we didn't find a package because there wasn't one, sir.
Soroush was putting up $20 million for this guy.
we just stopped him from delivering a ransom payment.
we got a hit when we ran his name and face through the DMV servers.
Seth Nelson... Lives in Maryland with his parents, works tech support for a cable company.
assuming each oxygen cylinder was full, he has maybe 20 hours before his air runs out.
ultrasound machine.
I want to know what other surprises the Courier has hiding inside him.
I also want to know why anyone thinks this kid is worth $20 million.
he's probably worth more.
my CIA sources just confirmed he's an NSA analyst... one of their best...
and only one of three people allowed to write and access the security protocols and software.
if he's coerced into working for a foreign power or criminal network, the damage would be catastrophic.
we need to make the Courier talk. There must be something he wants.
the guy's a psychopath.
luckily, we happen to have our own psychopath.
this is hilarious.
fredrick wrote to the editor of the Washington Post almost every day... thank you... about any and every subject.
listen to this one.
dear Mr. Bradley, what is up with all the rabbits..."
I need to know what you're not telling me about the Courier.
and what do I get in return?
my gratitude.
tell me what you've learned about your husband.
the gun that I found in the box is connected to an open homicide.
of whom?
It's...classified. I can't read the file.
I imagine you've found ways around that particular obstacle.
I know it happened in Boston last year.
I think it was a Russian tourist who was murdered... Victor Fokin.
you lived in New York at the time.
why would you think your husband would be in Boston?
because I was there with him.
he supposedly had a job interview, and we made it into a small vacation.
he killed two of them.
if he still has a taste for the poppy, there's a man who may be able to help us.
you're talking about a drug dealer.
I'm talking about a friend... a philosopher who practices an ancient ritual going back thousands of years.
there's a good chance he could be helpful in locating the Courier's safe house.
all I care about is finding Seth.
call your friend. I want the Courier's safe-house address.
thank you. - For what?
for being honest with me.
in my life, I don't encounter that frequently.
got a name. Tommy Phelps.
run it through the databases, see if it's even real.
you guys need to see this.
he had the Iranian buyer under surveillance for several days.
and this woman, I think she's the seller...
responsible for kidnapping Seth and hiring the Courier to pick up her money.
why the surveillance?
according to Reddington, the Courier kills anyone who tries to double-cross him.
he probably wanted to know where to find them if something went wrong.
find out who this woman is.
he has five objects embedded inside him.
some are surrounded with scar tissue... Been there for years.
what objects?
we've only been able to identify two. A key and another chip.
the others are just shadows.
I need a higher-resolution scan to I. D. them.
take him to Walter Reed. I want everything inside of him cut out.
the kid has... what... 14 hours of air left?
I can tell you where he is.
in exchange for what?
immunity.
I talk, then walk.
never gonna happen.
then the kid's dead.
I've been trying to figure out if there's anything in this world you care about.
how about him?
care about your little brother... Tommy?
we're bringing him in from Petersburg Federal Prison right now.
anything you want me to tell him?
you finally find him?
tell me about your brother... Who he works with, his contacts.
tell me about the people in his life.
there are no people in his life. - There's you.
tried to help you break out, didn't he?
from what I understand, he'd do anything for his little brother.
what's he moving now?
a 26-year-old M. I.T. grad.
lady, you don't understand Tommy.
I know his condition prevents him from feel...
no, I mean you don't understand him.
our old man knocked us around when he needed to, which didn't bother Tommy.
but dad hated that...
felt like he couldn't control his own son, and he couldn't.
so when he was 11, dad started hosting these dogfights.
not with two dogs, but with a dog and Tommy.
well, we had this barn. People would come from miles around.
they'd get drunk and make bets.
what it did to him over time...
Tommy's broken.
somewhere in his head, a switch flipped.
I wish I could help you, but...
you know how it goes.
you're here because somebody screwed up.
the deal went sideways.
and now the buyer and seller have targets on their head, if they're not dead already.
her name's Laurence Dechambou.
she's ex-French intelligence.
she now makes a handsome living selling secrets, mostly of a technological nature. I really don't understand any of it.
but she's clearly stepping up on this one, trying to make a legacy for herself.
she owns that nightclub.
last time I was there, we had a great deal of fun, until she tried to strangle me with her stocking.
I'll get a warrant. You'll have it by the time you get there.
she won't talk, and even if she did, what would you expect her to say?
she may know Seth's location. - she won't.
she's the only lead we have.
we arrest her and take our chances.
this is a bad idea, Harold.
actually, there may be another option.
she had to hand over Seth to the Courier somewhere.
we find the location, we might get lucky.
there could be security-cam or ATM footage of the exchange.
and we use it to track the Courier's movements last night.
that could lead to Seth.
and why would she tell you that, again?
she doesn't have to. She's still expecting her money.
we send someone in as the Courier, tell her the exchange was a setup, the deal's off...
she can pick up Seth where she dropped him off.
and we follow her to the drop-off point.
if you really want her to talk, I should meet with her.
every time you "meet," someone ends up dead.
we've gotten off to a rocky start.
you've killed three people. - I'm not perfect.
it's too risky. - He's right.
let me go. I can do this.
first sign this is going south, I want that club swarmed.
or just bend over any available piece of furniture and let her slap you on the ass. She loves that.
Oh, my God. Tom.
Oh, God. He's gonna kill me.
I'm so sorry. - You need to come home.
okay? I canceled the ultrasound.
Liz? - I can't do this right now.
look, I don't... I don't care what's going on at work, okay?
you and I need to talk. - Something incredibly important came up.
I don't care! You and I need to talk about something, and it's more important.
I promise we'll talk as long as you like, but later.
this is an emergen...
all teams stand by. Our man is entering the building.
here to see Dechambou.
I don't know what you're talking about.
line's over there, slick.
you need to make an example here.
you have to hurt him. That's what the Courier would do.
you know, I think we got off on the wrong foot here, uh...
isn't that her over there?
that was hot.
you know he can hear you, right? - Yep.
Hey. Come with me.
let's go. Come on.
would you mind excusing me for a moment?
you injured my doorman...
forced your way into my club.
is there a reason why I should not kill you right now?
you kill me, you kill Seth Nelson.
you're...
what the hell are you doing here?
we agreed the money was to be dropped off at a specified location.
plans change. - No. They don't.
the only reason I employed you was to shield me from unwanted attention, and you're at my front door?
there is no money. The Iranian was working with the FBI.
I killed him.
I've known Soroush for years.
well, if he didn't set me up, that leaves only one other person... you.
and I never trusted him.
that's why I employed you.
the bastard screwed us both here.
your NSA geek is where you left him last night.
we're done. Don't contact me again.
wait!
how do I know it's really you...
that I'm not being set up myself?
not my problem.
they say you can't feel pain. Prove it.
we're coming in. All teams prepare to mobilize.
first team, swarm the north doors on my...
is this what you need to see?
you want to watch me bleed, see if I react?
I've already lost the only thing in this world I've ever loved.
I have nothing in this world, except this job.
impressive.
except for one mistake.
if the Iranian is dead, the real Courier would have killed me, too.
which makes me wonder... - Get out... now!
who the hell are you? - Asset compromised. Hit the building.
she kidnapped Seth but has no idea where he is.
Yeah, well, the kid has less than eight hours of air left.
somebody had better get that Courier talking.
what do you suggest? Torture him? He doesn't feel pain.
he does feel pain.
he's got a brother serving 15 years in Petersburg...
the one thing in the world he cares about.
offer to reduce or commute his sentence in exchange for telling us Seth's location...
the life of a stranger for the life of his brother.
call the marshals. Get him back here.
we'll cut him open later.
he wounded two of the marshals and killed one with a concealed knife.
he was searched multiple times.
we think he used one of the objects hidden inside him.
he was carrying around his own escape package.
prisoner transport was found abandoned in Woodbridge, Virginia.
there's also a report of a stolen vehicle at the same site.
local police are searching for him now.
according to his brother, Woodbridge is where he grew up.
well, Seth could be there. - Find him... now.
in the meantime, see if you can get anything out of Dechambou.
she may not know where Seth is now, but she knows where she dropped him off last night.
I have a better suggestion... Let her go.
that's not gonna happen.
God, are you FBI.
when this woman was working for French intelligence, she was on track to be you, Harold.
since she's come over to my side, she's only gone up from there.
you really think you're gonna be able to prove anything against her?
we'll make something stick. It's only a matter of time.
you don't have any time.
pick her up in a week, in a month... next time.
but right now, if you want to save that man's life, you need to release Dechambou.
I'll make her talk.
how? - You don't want me to answer that.
how do I know you won't use what she says to get Seth for yourself?
you don't.
but I don't see that you have many other options left.
okay. Release her.
but if you screw me on this... - I'll consider it a bonus.
better make it a double.
if this is about that incident in Paris...
Oh, we'll always have Paris.
what do you want?
so many things.
but right now, I want some information.
where is the NSA agent?
I have no idea.
he was handed off to the Courier.
Yes. And he's been compromised.
who do you think he'll blame for that?
not me. The Iranian must have been working with the FBI.
laurence, the Iranian is dead, and you're next. You know that.
I did nothing wrong.
the world is rarely a fair place. That's why it needs people like me.
I'll get you out of the country and guarantee your safety.
there's a private jet awaiting your arrival right now.
in exchange, you give me the location where you dropped the kid off last night.
he's worth $20 million.
that $20 million is about to die.
this is not a negotiation.
how dare you?
I don't care who you are.
and I'm not going to let you swoop in at the last minute and profit from a mistake made by somebody I hardly know.
Oh, he knows you.
he knows where you live, where you work, where you play.
he knows you better than I do, and I know where that lovely little freckle is.
I give you a day and a half before he finds you.
try to be brave.
wait.
I will help you.
vehicle matches the description. - I have blood here.
all teams, we have the suspect's vehicle on the south side of...
he's outside!
Freeze!
on your knees.
Freeze! Turn around!
on your knees!
hands where we can see them.
check him.
he's dead.
how much time does that kid have left? - Less than 40 minutes.
at 4: 00 a. m. Dechambou left Seth in the back of a pickup truck at this rest stop in Manassas.
the Courier took the proof-of-life video at 4: 29 a. m...
just under 30 minutes later.
assume he spent 20 minutes minimum with Seth at the site.
that would give him 10 minutes of drive time from the rest stop, so he has to be somewhere in this radius.
this entire area's inaccessible.
the only place with road access is here at this open area. He has to be here.
how much air does he have left?
30 minutes tops.
with Dembe driving, we might make it just in time to see him die.
if we find our NSA friend and he's still alive, he might prove helpful.
you want Seth for your own reasons. - So should you.
he's in the dirt. - What?
the refrigerator... It's a coffin.
the Courier buries things under his skin.
he's in the dirt... right here.
he's not breathing.
I died once in Marrakech... Two and a half minutes.
you wouldn't believe what I saw on the other side.
who... Who are you?
the FBI... and friends.
we called your parents. They're gonna meet you at the hospital.
h-how can I ever repay you?
I'm sure we'll think of something.
don't even think about it.
what? The boy wishes to express gratitude.
I'm merely playing my part in the ritual.
you saved that kid's life, Keen. Good job.
that story you told Dechambou about...
your job being the only thing left... that was...
I was undercover. I said what I had to say to sell it.
agent Keen, got a delivery for you.
sign here, please.
thank you.
surveillance photos
white male
this man, the young NSA agent...
he allowed you access to the classified networks?
he did.
and I understand this was a one-time offer.
Yes.
the right question, and we could've made the world tremble.
finally found our adversary.
why did you waste it on the girl?
not "wasted," my friend.
circumstances are far more complex than we ever imagined.
I'm betting on the long play... The future.
your future's arriving now.
funny... all these wonderful manuscripts, and my favorite thing about this place is still the view from the sofa.
I love how the light breaks through the trees.
I don't even know why I'm here.
what's going on?
you got to see this.
sit down.
we need to talk.
that's funny.
I was just gonna say the same thing to you.
that you, Wilson?
Hello?
smile
what the hell?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
damn it!
David, it's me.
we have a serious problem. The network was breached.
I think they got the project files.
I'm headed to the backup site with the prototype now.
good morning, Mr. Kaplan.
gentlemen.
Oh, my God, what is this?
Vicu? a,100%. - How do I get one?
put it on your Christmas list, and if you're good...
okay.
let's see what we have here.
your ability to locate a crime scene never ceases to amaze.
you're like a human bloodhound.
I've been called worse.
how long? - Judging by the rate of decay, eight days, plus or minus.
the female died of strangulation.
male - gunshot wound to the chest, close range.
if you'd like a ballistic analysis, I'll need to perform a field autopsy.
as much as I'd love to see that, it won't be necessary.
the whodunit has already been solved.
perhaps another time, though.
all right.
I don't want any indication that we ever set foot here, so please put it all back the way you found it.
of course, dearie.
how do you want to handle this, Raymond?
your phone.
911, what's your emergency?
I'd like to report a missing person.
Oh, it was supposed to be a surprise.
I'm sorry, what is this?
I can't believe you teach fourth grade and have such little knowledge of pop culture.
I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about.
that is Uncle Flippo.
trust me on this, flashlight butt will get you some serious cred.
come on, now, let's be fair. I have cred.
Oh, yeah, says the man carrying the lunch box.
Mr. Keen? - Mm-hmm.
detective Debarros with Metro PD.
got a moment to talk about Jolene Parker?
how long has she been missing?
I was hoping you could help me with that question.
when was the last time you saw or spoke with her?
um... must have been last Sunday, right?
no, uh, Saturday.
I ran into her outside.
she was looking for an apartment in the neighborhood, so I referred her to a friend who's a real-estate agent.
but then she called back to say she'd changed her mind and that she was moving to Dayton with her fiance.
wasn't aware she had a fiance.
you have a name? - Uh, no, I'm afraid not.
you work with Miss Parker, is that correct?
we're talking to all her colleagues.
well, she, uh, subbed for Mr. Sinnard for a few weeks, but...
were you close?
uh, n-not particularly, no.
have you already searched her residence?
manager at the apartment hasn't seen her in about a week.
if she was planning to move, she didn't give notice.
if there's anything more we can do, please don't hesitate to ask.
I appreciate that. My, uh, number.
if you hear from her or anything comes up.
of course.
you're late.
sorry. Something came up.
is everything all right?
Yeah, fine.
what is all this?
just a little restoration.
of what? The timing mechanism for an explosive device?
should I be worried? - Yes.
man dies in
but not about this.
what am I looking at? - A car accident.
killed the driver, Nathan Platt.
why am I looking at it? - Because it was no accident.
the crash was engineered by a notorious cyber criminal known only as Ivan, or Ivan.
please. - And you know this how?
I've had some experience with the man.
he stole from me.
his brother and I spent a delightful evening sharing stories over a plate of meat jelly and half a gallon of vodka.
all the while, Ivan had his hand in my wallet.
my job isn't to settle your grudges, so I'm gonna need a little more than your gut instinct that Ivan was involved.
how about a confession?
Ivan took credit for the hit in some deep, dark recess of the internet
a place only inhabited by scary people and reckless teenagers.
a place where curiosity inevitably kills the cat.
so, Ivan ran some guy off the road.
or are you thinking it's something a little more sophisticated?
given his technological skills, he wouldn't even need to get his hands dirty.
Ivan's had a very long career
10 years of collapsing Russian markets, selling off government secrets, disrupting Siberian pipelines.
it sounds like his beef's with Moscow.
this is the first time Ivan's ever struck on US soil, a fact that should have you all very concerned, because whatever he has planned, this is only the very beginning.
here's the information we have on our victim.
Nathan Gregory Platt, 43, employed at Roy's TV Repair since '09. No wife, no kids.
and no affiliation with any government agencies or connections to Russian business interests.
doesn't fit with Ivan's MO.
if I could take a look at that car's ECU, I might be able to confirm whether it was electronically manipulated.
do it.
Aram. - What's up?
I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
I need to pull the phone records for this number.
the name's Jolene Parker.
okay. - Thank you.
let's see. Inventory number 760209.
here we are. - Thanks, we'll take it from here.
Hey, can I ask you something?
why are you here?
I'm assessing evidence.
there's no shame in taking a couple days off.
I mean, if it were me, I wouldn't want to be here.
job takes my mind off Audrey.
Hey, guys. This thing was definitely tampered with.
the airbag deployed before the crash, not after.
there's a message in the can bus deliberately left here for someone to find.
what is it? - 32 bytes, 011010
okay, translation, please? - It's binary.
it spells "Ivan." His digital signature.
what's that? - I'm not sure. Any ideas?
looks like some kind of RF shielding and a passive satellite tracking system.
doesn't look like something you'd find lying around Roy's TV Repair.
our victim's been moonlighting.
we should take it to the computer forensics lab.
step away from the car. Now!
get away from the car.
Hey, this area is restricted.
not to me, it isn't.
and you are? - Assistant Director Harold Cooper.
who the hell are you? - Agent in charge Galarza, NSA Special Projects.
why are you detaining my people, Agent Galarza?
your people had a piece of stolen technology in their possession.
everyone all right?
case was busted open when we found it.
whatever was inside was taken from the crash scene.
what kind of classified tech are we talking about?
unless you have TS/SCI vigil clearance, I'm not at liberty to say.
why is a special FBI task force investigating a car accident?
agent Galarza, you and I both know this is no simple car accident.
I have information on who killed your man, and if you want that information, you're gonna have to tell me what he took.
so you can either do that now, or we can dance for a few hours while I secure a warrant.
but by then, you may have lost another man.
Nathan Platt was one of ours - tailored access operations technician.
which means what, exactly? - That he didn't repair TVs for a living.
then what was Platt really working on?
this.
project Skeleton Key.
david Fisher is our lead engineer. He'll brief you on the details.
pleased to meet you.
the Skeleton Key is the culmination of five years of R&D into state-of-the-art cyber warfare.
it's designed to deliver a knockout blow to enemy infrastructure in wartime.
no cruise missiles or boots on the ground.
defense grids, weapons systems, and communications
the Skeleton Key can cut through the world's most secure networks with the push of a button.
so, you're saying our suspect is now in possession of this device?
a prototype for the control module.
we just finished it last week.
in fact, our whole operation was about to be relocated to a cybercom ops center in Colorado for field testing before it went missing.
so, the federal government has armed a cyber terrorist with the digital equivalent of a nuclear warhead.
another fabulous example of your tax dollars at work and yet another reason why I don't pay taxes.
state's reaching out to the Russians, but getting them to cooperate will be one thing, and actually finding this Ivan will be a separate problem altogether.
it's in Minsk, Belarus. That's where Ivan is currently.
wait, when did you learn this?
I've always known this.
and it didn't occur to you to say something earlier?
you FBI are such blunt instruments.
Lizzy, you don't just swoop in and arrest a man like Ivan, because you know what he'll tell you once he's in custody? Nothing.
I assume you have a better idea?
if you want to know what Ivan is up to, you have to get him to share that.
not because he has to, because he wants to.
how do I do that?
we create a problem for him and then solve it.
and to do that, we need to take a field trip.
Hello, Evan.
seat's taken.
perhaps the face escapes you.
my card.
FBI TEN MOST WANTED FUGITIVE
allow me to refresh your memory.
grand Cayman Bank account number 1210227579.
it held approximately $5 million, and then, suddenly, it didn't.
it was a clever hack. Kudos and all that.
but I've come to collect - with interest.
sorry, friend. I have no interest.
I wouldn't go out there if I were you.
is that some kind of a threat? - Yes, but not from me.
seems you've stirred up the borscht, Ivan.
murdering that NSA troll got the FBI talking to the FSB.
now you're neck-deep in the beets, Ivan.
they've issued an arrest order for you.
according to my informant, they're en route here now.
of course they are.
this piroshki is delicious.
my point
I can secure safe travel for you out of the country - for a price.
let me guess,$5 million plus interest?
thank you very much. I'll pass.
Oh, there's my cue. You're on your own, comrade.
I accept your generous offer.
I thought you might have a change of heart. Shall we?
$8 million. I want it transferred to this account.
fine. Let's get out of here.
you can't be serious.
they're gonna be here any moment.
then you'd better type fast.
thank you.
you are a true master.
okay. Done.
see?
do you find all those little fingerprints on the glass distracting, or does that sort of thing not bother you?
stop! Ivan!
you think he bought it? - Hell, I did.
I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you.
what are you doing up? Is something wrong?
Jolene Parker - her real name is Lucy Brooks.
what?
I heard from Detective Debarros. She's a wanted criminal.
what's a V-i-C-A-P? - ViCAP.
it's the Bureau's violent-criminal database.
she's a convicted felon
robbery, aggravated assault.
two years ago, her parole officer in Santa Fe reported her missing.
hasn't been seen since.
now she shows up as a substitute teacher in an elementary school
I mean, how does that even happen? - I am so sorry.
what are you sorry for?
she was here, in our house...
in our bedroom.
and it's because of me.
Liz, that's crazy.
no. If you knew what I do...
what do you mean?
God, if she had done anything to you...
come on, I'm a big boy. I can take care of myself.
don't beat yourself up.
you could never have known this.
you never really know people... do you?
I'm gonna find her - who she works for.
whoever they are, whatever it takes, I'm gonna find her.
uh, Agent Keen.
I got that information on Jolene Parker's phone records.
What'd you find? - You were her last outgoing call.
I was able to pull location data from the cell towers.
that's the address where she called you from - La Vista Street, over in Brookland.
Aram, you're amazing.
so, tell me, Ivan, what are your intentions?
I assume you took the Skeleton Key for one of three reasons
some dastardly deed you have planned, something dastardly someone else has planned, or you've lined up a buyer and have no idea what they have planned.
I'm curious, what's your price?
honestly, I haven't given it much thought.
don't be coy, Ivan.
whatever the number, I can likely double it.
you could probably use the retirement money right about now.
you have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
the hack in DC, the NSA agent - it wasn't me.
then who was it? - I don't know, but he's been using my name.
look, my contempt is not for the US. It's always been with Russia.
last thing I need is a Hellfire drone missile up my zadnitsa, right?
then if you didn't do it, who did?
whoever it is, they're very good at covering their tracks.
I haven't been able to ID them yet.
perhaps I could be of some assistance.
so, we've reviewed the information Ivan supplied.
it turns out this mystery hacker has only been operating for about three or four months.
we've linked his profile to a recent attack on an encrypted defense network coordinating special-access programs.
that would give him intel on black-budget projects.
the information alone would be worth millions.
may also be how he learned about the Skeleton Key in the first place.
as if that is not enough, he's also hacked himself access to pay-porn sites and a pile of "Mythcrash" gift cards, which is harder than it sounds.
he even breached the Social Security Administration to raise benefit payments for someone.
who?
as you can see, Ms. Lee, your payments went up by $1, 200 in September.
says who? - Social Security Administration.
you're saying you didn't notice the extra money?
it's direct-deposited into my account.
I never bother to check the statement.
I just balance my checkbook, same as I always do.
any idea of why these payments would have gone up like this?
I may be old, but I'm not stupid.
I know when I am being accused of something, and if you think I had something to do with this, you are mistaken.
we believe this is the work of a computer hacker.
we're just trying to figure out what his connection to you might be.
a computer hacker?
I can't even set my thermostat without the help of my grandson.
your grandson?
okay, you guys will have 55 minutes.
Number-2 pencils only, no pens this time.
everybody check and make sure your graphing calculators are set to radians.
if they're not set to radians, you're gonna have a bad time.
okay. You can begin.
you have a second? - Yeah, what's up?
I'm following up some leads on Jolene's case, and I came across an address.
what's the address?
1896 La Vista Street.
I've never heard of it.
it's not her home address.
maybe it's her fiance's? I thought I'd check it out.
I think you're cutting out.
Hey, can you hear me?
the place was ransacked before I got here.
there's even a cache of burnt documents in a bucket outside, but they're ashes now.
you get a visual on the suspect?
male, Caucasian, over six-feet.
uh... dark hair.
excuse me.
keen. - We have a lead on our suspect.
we're heading over to Lake Hill High School.
okay, I'm five minutes behind you.
I don't want to step on any toes, but...
you want to be looped into the investigation?
sure.
bantam Finance, how may I direct your call?
I'm having a problem with my account
number Delta-Sierra-451.
line is secure. Proceed.
watch post is compromised. Bona fide's in question.
tell Berlin I was forced to liquidate.
what does it say about me that my entire life fits into six cardboard boxes?
that you're not hung up on material things?
or that I'm boring.
do you know anyone in Briargate?
no. My dad does.
me, not so much.
first day is gonna be so awkward.
I really hate introducing myself to people.
you'll be fine. It's Colorado - free weed.
it's not free. It's just legal.
well, then, I guess you're screwed.
what's going on?
wait!
evac Drill Initiated
please proceed to the closest emergency exit.
please proceed to the closest emergency exit.
move, move, move! Sorry.
please proceed to the closest emergency exit.
so, how exactly does a 17-year-old kid slip through your fingers?
he hacked the school's security system and activated the automated evac protocols.
if you ever find him, ask him if he'd like to earn some extra money.
we'll find him. Forensics is processing his house, his computer, e-mails, cell records.
well, it sounds like you have everything well under control, which begs the question, why are you here?
have you ever seen this woman?
hand me that piece right there.
her name is Jolene Parker.
she was a sub at Tom's school.
but as of yesterday morning, she's a missing person.
I found high-end surveillance gear, a cache of documents, burner cells.
was there any evidence connecting any of this to me?
no.
then what exactly would you like me to do?
turns out Jolene Parker doesn't exist.
it's an alias.
I want to know who she is, and I want to know why the hell she's inserted herself into our lives.
I can't answer that.
you can't or you won't?
well, that's a matter of interpretation.
not to me.
you said there's always something you're not telling me.
just once, I'd like to hear the whole truth from you.
I wish I knew the whole truth.
you know what?
don't worry about it.
the truth is, I don't need evidence to connect this to you.
Jolene Parker is in my life because of you.
none of this happened until you arrived on my doorstep.
my life was great
my marriage, Tom.
thank God I have Tom, because with you, I never know what to believe.
I have never lied to you.
how the hell would I know?
have fun with your project.
Harrison was using some serious layers of encryption on his computer, but I was able to find a hidden partition filled with terabytes of data.
who is she?
her name's Abby Fisher.
any relation to - Yes, she's the daughter of David Fisher, lead engineer of the Skeleton Key program. And check this out
she's enrolled at the same high school as Harrison.
the photos look like they were taken from a webcam.
he breached her computer, surreptitiously watched her, and it gets worse.
he hacked into her cell, e-mail, texts.
hell, he even got into her mp3 collection.
he chronicles her every move. - He's stalking her.
get David on the phone.
Hello? - Mr. Fisher, this is Agent Keen.
I need to ask you a question about your daughter.
I don't understand.
is she familiar with a young man named Harrison Lee
uh, I lost him.
what's going on?
what happened? - I'm not sure. Hold on.
doesn't make sense.
all of DC is dark.
system down
he activated the Skeleton Key.
wtf
not all
where are you?
meet me
agent Keen, we got cut off. What's wrong?
we believe Abby may be in danger.
where the hell is she?
watch this.
how are you doing this?
follow the lights.
Harrison has the Skeleton Key in his possession, it's how he triggered this blackout.
is there any way to track it?
Yes, if it's active.
the key uses a standard LTE signal, right?
you should be able to triangulate his location using cell towers.
you just need the IMEI and the ICCID numbers.
signal triangulation failed
no good. All but one of the city's towers are offline.
Harrison could be anywhere in this five-mile radius.
how could he cause a city-wide blackout and access cellphone networks?
he can leave what he needs up and running - while keeping everything else powered off. - We could use that.
Aram, are any of the sub stations running within your five-mile radius?
uh, one, and it's pulling a lot of power.
to where?
it's a metro station. Green Line, Branch Avenue.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You'll need these.
Hello?
Jackie, is that you?
Hi. - Harrison.
what are you doing down here?
waiting. For you.
okay, this is gonna sound kind of crazy. I was just texting my friend Jackie.
you were actually texting with me.
what do you mean?
I just wanted this moment to be private.
just you and me.
w-we don't even know each other.
I feel like I know you.
I know that you listen to Jamestown Revival on repeat to fall asleep, that you bite your bottom lip when you're nervous.
don't be scared. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? I'd never hurt you.
can I just go home? Can I please just go home?
is that really what you want?
I know you don't want to move to Colorado.
I know you want to stay here and finish your senior year.
you told that to Jackie in an e-mail.
how do you know that?
now you don't have to move anymore.
I made that possible.
this - it's your dad's project.
it's why he was being transferred, why he had to go to Colorado.
how did you get that? - I stole it.
and now they can't continue the program.
don't you get it? You don't have to move anymore.
why would you do all of this?
because, Abby, I love you.
wait!
are you okay?
Abby, wake up.
go! I've got her.
Abby? I'm Agent Malik.
paramedics are on their way to get you, okay?
doors open
doors closed
one step closer and I send this thing off the tracks.
Harrison, my name is Agent Keen.
I have nothing to say to you.
you spent the last four months coming up with the perfect plan, and right now, nothing is going as expected.
all of this, it was a romantic gesture, wasn't it?
she was supposed to fall for me just like I fell for her.
you must feel like your whole world is falling apart.
but it isn't.
we can end this.
right now, you and I.
you're right. We can.
engine engaged
hazardous speed
Harrison, no!
it's too late. This train's gonna crash.
I can't stop the train.
it's impossible to override the control system without access to the Skeleton Key.
Harrison, I know you feel like this is your only option, but it's not.
you have a choice.
choice?
I'm a murderer.
you and I both know that the car accident was only that. An accident.
you did not want that man to die, did you?
this isn't what Abby would want.
ATCS override.
emergency brakes engaged
how much track does that train have left?
about 5, 000 yards.
is that enough?
we're gonna crash.
what happened? Did it crash?
I don't know.
you guys there?
stay put. We're coming to get you.
good work.
Yeah. You too.
Hey, you hungry?
Tom's cooking tonight, so that means there will be a ton of extra food.
Thanks, but I think I'll just head home.
you sure?
Liz, you have someone waiting for you at home.
you don't have to feel bad about that.
see you tomorrow.
see you tomorrow.
Hey, babe.
I need some wine, preferably the entire bottle.
Oh, no. That bad?
Hey, last we talked you were going into Jolene's apartment.
what happened? Any word?
it's not good.
there was evidence of foul play.
foul play? What does - what does that mean?
there's nothing concrete.
MPD's still processing the apartment.
Yeah. W-what do they know? Do they have a suspect?
they don't, but when I went to the apartment, there was someone there - a man.
he-- he knocked me down.
what? Did he hurt you? - No, I'm fine.
are you okay? You were attacked. Liz.
the police are looking for him.
did you get a good look at him, at least?
I wish.
just the thought of someone doing that to you - hurting you...
some stranger.
what do you need?
wine.
here
what is this?
be careful of your husband.
please, I didn't do anything.
I can only lead you to the truth. I can't make you believe it.
is everything okay?
I'm fine. It's just work.
you sure?
cause I hate to break it to you, but after two years of marriage, I know that that face means you're upset.
I'm fine.
I promise.
Really?
really.
you were right.
come in.
what's this?
it's a 1940s Sorrento music box.
I know this song.
when I was a little girl, I had these terrible nightmares.
I remembered...
flashes of...
of fire and smoke.
God, so much smoke.
my dad would lay in bed with me...
and hold me in his arms...
and hum that song.
he'd tell me I was safe
that everything was gonna be okay.
you spent days building that damn thing.
you knew about the song.
my father.
you knew I'd find out the truth.
and you wanted me...
to know that everything is going to be okay.
you're going to be okay.
you sure you're feeling okay? You were coughing all night.
I'm fine. It's probably nothing.
what time is Stella's talent show? - 7: 00.
any idea when she goes on, or do I have to sit and watch that Doyle kid do backflips for 20 minutes?
Oh. Be nice.
no, I don't want you to get what I got.
I'll see you tonight.
morning, Paul.
911. What's your emergency?
I need a doctor-- Westland Bank, 14th and Vermont.
what's happening? Are you injured?
do you record these calls? - Yes. What's your emergency?
Amanda... hey. It's me.
look... something happened. I'm sick.
I want to let you know how much I love you.
Paul, are you all right?
Paul, Paul. Look at me. Look at me. You all right?
someone call a doctor!
Paul, Paul, look at me. Paul.
Paul, look at me. Look at me. Relax. Relax, Paul.
what's going on? Hey, I-- - Back up, sir. Back up.
I said, "What's going on?" - Back up now.
look, folks, if I can have your attention, we have a situation that's gonna require everyone stay put.
I'm not staying. - Based on this man's symptoms, we have a reason to believe whatever he has may be contagious.
wait, you're saying that we're-- we're what? Infected with that?
let me out of here. - For your own safety, - Back up now. Back up. you need to remain in the building. Please!
my son, my son. Please. - Nobody's leaving. Nobody can leave.
I said, "Let me out"!
nobody is leaving this building! We're under quarantine.
I should have let you rough him up.
listen... I can't vouch for how Cooper or the Bureau may react to this, but this, Tom-- You're doing the right thing here, Liz.
no matter how this all turns out,
I'm gonna find Tom, or whatever the hell his name is, and I'm gonna take him apart piece by piece until he tells me everything.
and I'll help you do just that.
but right now, the only real way out of this thing is to go right through it.
you ready?
I first met the individual who calls himself "Tom Keen..."
on July 9, 2010, at a cafe in Georgetown.
I believe he was inserted into my life in an effort to locate Raymond Reddington.
I believe he had advanced knowledge that Reddington would contact me.
how or why, I don't know.
no. That stays.
I also believe that since making contact,
Tom Keen's dual purpose has been data collection and counterintel.
did you tell your husband you were working with Raymond Reddington?
I did not. And if you would refrain from referring to him as my husband, I'd appreciate that.
and you have no idea as to his whereabouts at this time?
no.
when Tom Keen realized I wasn't going to share my work details with him...
he insisted on surrendering himself to me so that he could front-door infiltrate this facility for further data collection.
you think that he wanted to be discovered by you in order that he could be detained here?
is that your belief? - It is.
he wanted inside this facility.
what have you learned about any possible accomplices?
I know three.
christopher Maly, who claimed to be his brother, Craig Keen.
Jolene Parker, also known as Lucy Brooks.
both are dead. Maly committed suicide.
and I believe Tom Keen murdered Jolene Parker.
the third is Gina Zanetakos.
I'm not sure how she's connected, but she is available for questioning, since she is serving a sentence for conspiracy and murder at Danbury.
no, Gina Zanetakos escaped two weeks ago when she was on a work furlough.
her whereabouts are unknown.
why didn't you inform the Bureau about Tom Keen after uncovering his initial deception?
I wanted to investigate him. - Why?
so I could see how deep this rabbit hole would run.
you didn't want to help him escape?
that's really a stupid question.
call Reddington. Tell him you lost the tail.
do it now.
they lost the husband.
how bad is it?
worse than I thought.
you know, I knew a guy once
he had a spider web all down his arm.
he had one ring for every body that he claimed credit for.
what's your name?
what's your name?
you a killer, Jesse?
I sure hope you're a killer, because I don't think you have a future in surveillance.
I-I can help you, man. Reddington-- he trusts me.
Reddington doesn't even know your name.
but I know for damn sure that he didn't tell you anything about his business.
that's not true. I know a lot. - He gave you a photo.
he gave you some cash up front, and he told you to follow me.
you don't know who I am.
but the man that you work for-- he's very careful.
he's cautious. He's controlled. He's ruthless.
I know all that 'cause I followed him for years. But...
here's the thing. The guy that I work for-- he's more cautious, he's more controlled, and he's far more ruthless.
maybe he's the guy I should be working for.
you don't choose Berlin.
he chooses you.
and he is coming.
man. That really is a nice tattoo.
what's this? - My letter of resignation.
Hello, Agent Keen.
as of today, I'm requesting an immediate transfer out of the task force.
look, Agent Keen, the revelations about your husband
I trust you had nothing to do with it. - I've made up my mind.
I have an urgent case.
he'll have to tell it to someone else. - That's not going to work.
I trust you had nothing to do with your husband.
the Bureau, not so much.
but they're willing to give you the benefit of the doubt precisely because they know how valuable you are.
I am only valuable because I'm willing to speak to Reddington, - and that is no longer the case. - Agent Keen...
he killed my father.
Reddington went into my father's hospital room when he was alive.
and when Reddington came out, my father was dead.
I'd like to have a word with Agent Keen privately, please.
no. - No?
this case relates directly to your husband and why he was here.
I have reason to believe an attack is imminent.
sir, Reddington should tell you what he knows, or you should detain him here indefinitely.
there was a piece of evidence in your storage unit-- Berlin.
is that what this is about? Something in Berlin?
people are going to die, Harold.
those lives are on his hands.
I don't want to seem dismissive, and I promise I will consider your request and all of your grievances.
but if what he says is true-- - Sir, please accept my resignation.
agent Keen, are you really willing to put your anger at me above the lives of innocent people?
I'll do the case.
but when it's over, I'm finished.
understood? I'm done.
earlier today, a man died at The Westland Bank in Manhattan.
reports indicate the cause of death may have been the Cullen virus.
hazmat teams have quarantined the bank.
the deceased has been identified as a Paul Blankenship, an armored-truck driver.
they're working to identify how he was infected.
paul Blankenship didn't pick up this bug while wandering through subtropical Africa.
I believe he was infected as part of a larger plot involving myself and this task force.
how does a man dying in a bank have anything to do with you?
threats on my life are a constant. I monitor them closely.
two days ago, I received word of a biological threat.
does this connect back to Berlin?
I suspect this incident at the bank is not what it seems, but rather the first shot in a larger, coordinated assault aimed directly at me.
I don't think Paul Blankenship was a victim of an outbreak.
I think he was a foot soldier in a biological army.
I think he was meant to carry out orders by a superior,
an outbreak of Cullen could lead to a global pandemic.
the very threat of an outbreak would cause panic, fear.
and fear is a valuable tool to get people to do what you want.
sounds like an elaborate plan just to get to you.
but I sincerely doubt his death was part of the plan,
Dr. Nina Buckner, CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service.
good to see you again. Thanks for taking the time.
we don't want to interfere with your investigation.
no, actually, you do, especially after what I'm about to show you.
we did a full work-up on the victim.
he was infected with what we call Cullen, a virus strain so lethal that two dozens of the world's leading virologists declared a moratorium on all research.
it's too deadly to study?
all known cultures are on lockdown. The risk is too great.
the influenza pandemic in 1918 killed 50 million people.
if this strain went airborne, it would wipe out that number in the first month.
if it went airborne. So you're saying you think it didn't?
correct. We've checked everyone in the bank.
incredibly, nobody else is infected.
it looks like this virus was intentionally mutated to contain itself in the original host. It doesn't spread.
so you're saying that somebody designed this virus, built it to target the infected victim.
Yes. He was poisoned.
I think we may have found the murder weapon.
this was in Blankenship's jacket.
that's the virus? - Well, we don't know yet. We're taking it back for analysis now.
why would somebody send it to him? Did he inject himself?
well, that's your department. But I'll say this
there are not a lot of scientists proficient enough to mutate a virus like this.
anyone working with Cullen is doing so in isolation, illegally, and for no good purpose.
you realize if you leave, the task force ends.
everyone's lives go back to normal, except yours.
this doctor friend of yours-- tell me about him.
he was the lead research scientist on infectious diseases at USAMRIID and the foremost expert on the Cullen virus.
was." Now he's a criminal.
no, the work he's done has been criminalized, which is why he left USAMRIID.
but if anybody knows anything about black-market viruses, it's Dr. Bruce Sanders.
this is a copy of Tom's code book.
it was used to pass information between Tom and his superiors.
I had my associate Borakove decode it.
there's surprisingly little about myself and my organization, but it contains speculation about our cases and a great deal about you.
I suggest you use some discretion as to how you disclose any of it.
it's an olive branch, Lizzy.
Dembe, do you mind trading seats with me?
I just heard back from the CDC.
syringe found on our victim?
well, it didn't contain the virus.
it contained the cure.
you're looking at the antidote to the world's deadliest virus.
antidote? I thought the CDC said there was no known cure.
there wasn't... until this. - I-I don't understand.
if Blankenship had the cure, then why is he dead?
forensics pulled text messages from Blankenship's cell.
your next treatment is on its way.
do your job on the 30th and treatments will continue.
do your job." What job?
the 30th is tomorrow.
this isn't an outbreak. It's extortion.
Blankenship was infected with a deadly virus and blackmailed for the antidote.
which he refused.
this guy chose to die instead of following orders.
Why? Blackmailed for what? To kill Reddington?
it still seems like a bit of a reach.
Reddington was right about one thing.
whatever this organization, Berlin, is planning, Blankenship was vital to it.
and with him gone, Berlin's gonna need a replacement.
Mr. Klein, you are dying.
I have infected you with the Cullen virus.
it is the single deadliest pathogen in existence.
within a matter of hours, your temperature will spike, rashes will spread.
you will experience blackouts, bleeding.
and within 24 hours, you will be dead.
medical science has no known cure.
but I do.
in the syringe before you, you will find your first treatment, which will sustain you for the next 24 hours.
contact the police or notify anyone, including your family, and there will not be another.
if you're still alive in 24 hours, you will receive your second treatment, along with instructions on how to proceed.
Dr. Sanders is incredibly well-respected by everyone on staff.
I've never seen anyone quite as dedicated to his work.
please, Monique, tell me he's not testing his pincushion voodoo on the patients.
he's still doing research? - Oh, yes.
and, mind you, it's all over my head.
but virology is Dr. Sanders' lifework.
I'll check on you in a bit.
one of the brightest men I've ever met.
Dr. Sanders. I don't know if you remember me, but
Liechtenstein. - Right.
december 2010.
no, no. January 2011.
Reming-- No, no, no. Reddington - Raymond. - Yes! Raymond!
sit down, Raymond.
sit, please.
I met Dr. Sanders here through a mutual friend to discuss a very delicate and underfunded research project.
as I recall, the science was awesome...
but financially precarious.
and we watched Space Ranger.
Yes. Space Ranger. What a memory.
I heard you went through a bit of a rough patch.
but it looks like you've landed on your feet.
I've never been better.
and you've relocated.
the, um... staff is not exactly what you would call "top drawer.
I have fired Monique twice, and she still shows up for work every day like clockwork.
I don't have the heart to pull her security badge.
Dr. Sanders is at the forefront of virology.
he's been working tirelessly to find cures for some of the world's most deadly illnesses.
a few years back, he injected himself with meningitis and along with what he thought was a synthesized cure.
but I'm-- no, I'm-- I'm-- I'm fine, really.
full recovery.
doctor, we've come to you on pressing business.
what can you tell us about the Cullen virus?
Oh, spooky. Spooky stuff.
bad news.
you've researched it?
well, it was recently used as a weapon to target a man named Paul Blankenship.
he must be the first.
there will be more. - How do you know that?
Cullen is the instrument of the Apocalypse.
the five horsemen are coming, and they will bring death and destruction unlike
there are four horsemen. - There are five!
this I know.
how do you know?
the Space Agent.
the Space Agent.
is he still active? - Active and operational.
UD-4126 was never
that wormy little bastard could barely land the simulator, let alone carry out an Alpha-level mission.
Chesterfield cleared him.
two days later, he came to me for research.
he wanted me to look at some-- some field tests, systematic observations.
anything you can share?
well, I've got research on Cullen, if that's what you mean, and activated carbon samples, absorption tests.
whatever you've got.
I'd love our people at the lab to give this a once-over.
Yeah.
UD-4126 is way out of line this time, way out of line.
well, I'll say.
space Agent UD-4126." How stupid do you think I am?
not the slightest. - He's a patient in a mental facility.
this little field trip had nothing to do with trying to solve the case and everything to do with you getting me alone in that plane so you could try to change my mind.
Lizzy, someone is using a unique and deadly pathogen.
Yeah, you keep saying that. Who? Who is this mysterious someone?
I don't know.
have you ever had a selfless moment in your entire life?
one where you weren't trying to think of some angle you could play or advantage you could gain?
my God, it's amazing.
if you expect me to forgive you...
what are you doing?
catching a cab to the airport. I'm flying back on my own.
you understand if Agent Keen walks, the deal is off.
Reddington will no longer have immunity.
I understand.
we'll imprison him, suspend Habeas Corpus indefinitely, and Reddington will likely never see sunlight again.
as for Agent Keen, I can tell you right now I've gone on record with the Director stating that I believe we've been overly indulgent with her.、
we still haven't fully surmised the true nature of her relationship with Reddington, and now her husband is a fugitive?
if you're trying to impugn her integrity, I can assure you
agent Keen has been nothing but an earnest and dedicated agent.
and I can assure you that given the way this task force is ending, your future at the Bureau is also in question.
but about Reddington
talk to me about how we're gonna bring him in.
what do you got?
what?
is it true? Are you leaving?
look, I'm sorry. - Liz, don't be sorry.
we support whatever decision you make.
Reddington sent over the research notes from the doctor you met with.
the "doctor" we met with.
Sanders is a patient in a mental institution.
Yeah, well, according to Dr. Buckner, he's created an antidote to Cullen.
Sanders is researching a lethal virus from inside a psych ward?
that's not all-- in order to test these theories, he'd have to synthesize the molecules, find out how they interact in vivo.
for that, he'd need a lab.
you really believe he's working with someone on the outside who's testing his theories, manufacturing an antidote?
if Sanders has a partner, he may be the one who infected Blankenship.
you've got to go back to him, find out who Sanders is working with.
Bruce Sanders won't talk to me. - Of course he won't.
I need your help.
I thought you and I weren't on speaking terms. - We're not.
how reminiscent of elementary school.
what's this? - A gift from your husband.
it's a tattoo from the neck of an associate of mine-- a message of sorts.
it's a reminder of the kind of people we're dealing with.
about our trip to see Dr. Sanders, will you be traveling with me, or are you flying coach again?
let's talk about Space Agent UD-4126.
no can do.
did he visit you here? - Don't remember.
did he come to you for help?
you said she was trustworthy. What are all these questions?
she's been cleared Alpha level.
you want me to get Chesterfield on the line?
I need answers.
well, I-- Yes, he came to me for help.
he, uh, asked me to look at some fieldwork.
who came to you for help? - UD-4126.
you have to give me the scientist's name. Who's doing the experiments?
I told you his name-- UD-4126.
his name. - He doesn't know his name.
4126. That's all I know. - Bruce, lives are at stake.
UD-4126-- I need some way of knowing who that is. - No!
the horsemen! I told you what I know!
it was a top-secret mission, this! That's all I know!
what is it? What did you see?
I ran every badge from every agency that responded to the incident at Westland Bank
homeland, FBI, FEMA and DCPD.
why limit the search to the bank?
because that's where I saw it-- a badge with the UD classification.
searching the preface "UD" turned up nothing.
so I widened to HHS, ADSTR, and I got a hit.
the only department that uses the preface UD is the Center for Disease Control.
space Agent 4126" is...
Dr. Nikolaus Vogel.
he lives in Arlington.
clear. - Go! Go!
basement. - Upstairs.
we need to have a few words, Dr. Vogel.
who are you blackmailing and why?
I asked you a question.
whatever the incident is, we know it's scheduled to happen today.
tell us what we need to know.
help up stop this. We can help you.
there's nothing to say. There's nothing you can do.
he's coming. - Who's coming?
you know what happens if you go through with your resignation.
they'll take him. Reddington disappears.
this task force, this group never existed.
he'll never go to trial. He won't be in jail.
he'll be shoved in a box and interrogated the rest of his life.
and knowing Reddington, that won't be long.
this isn't about my husband or even what Reddington did to my father.
this is... all of it.
it's too much.
I'm not strong enough.
you are. You've proven that.
where do you want it to happen?
anywhere he won't suspect.
Dembe, it's me. Is he there?
I need to see Reddington.
tell me about the people you blackmailed. Who are they?
you don't seem like someone with enemies.
Oh, no, they're not. They're not my enemies at all.
they're just... different people from all walks of life.
I'm gonna need names. - You can't have them.
and it won't make any difference, anyway.
how are you gonna help them?
I'm the only one that has what they want...
...what they need.
Hey, kids.
so, they're gonna carry out my instructions or die trying, no matter what you do.
that's how blackmail works, sweetheart.
I've got to hand it to you.
it's a pretty sharp play.
infecting people with a fatal virus that only you have the antidote for and then telling them they can't have that antidote unless they do exactly as you ask.
such a smart plan...
that I borrowed it.
now, I'm no doctor, so I don't know how fast this virus of yours takes to set in, but I know it will kill you, soon.
so you're gonna do what I say and give me those five names, 'cause that's how blackmail works, sweetheart.
let me know when you're ready to talk.
what do you know about recent criminal activity in Berlin?
Aussiedler"? How do you spell that?
what about the Tambov gang?
Oh, my God.
it's all connected. - What is?
all of it, everything-- the blacklist.
we've been looking at it all wrong.
we see these cases Reddington gives us as individual, as if they're disconnected, but what if they're not random?
what is there's a larger pattern to all of it?
Reddington got a number from Wujing, a code that he entered into ViCAP after helping us stop General Ludd in order to identify Lucy Brooks, also known as Jolene Parker, who he then tracked down using The Alchemist's client list.
they're connected. Maybe not all, but some.
Gina Zanetakos, the courier.
I believe they all trace back to one entity.
in Berlin.
so Reddington's using us to clear the table, wipe out the competition.
that's what I thought. That's what we're trained to think.
but that's not how he thinks.
look at this like he would, like a criminal.
Reddington said he's bracing for war.
and in a war, you need allies.
put yourself in his position. It's not just the FBI who's after him.
what if there's someone else, someone he can't stop alone?
what better way for a criminal to turn the tables on someone than to get the FBI on his side?
our resources and our protection
not to expand his empire, but simply to survive.
why wouldn't he just tell us who's after him? - Because he doesn't know.
Sanders said there's an impending apocalypse, and Vogel's words to us? "He's coming"?
who's coming? Berlin.
it's not a place. It's a person.
and that person is coming for Red-- today.
Dr. Vogel talked.
meet our blackmail victims
an electrician, a maintenance person, a retired air-traffic controller, and an armored-truck driver.
and they're connected how? - Airports.
Edger Pivens is a retired air-traffic controller.
the others have contracts with various airports in the area
waste management, security, and power upgrades.
the driver of the armored vehicle?
his company picks up payroll from regional airports.
paul Blankenship's replacement.
this last guy, Dimitri Federov
former pilot for Aeroflot, the Russian airline.
that's five victims. - Five horsemen.
that's a great band name.
and Vogel told you this was what? An attack? - He's not sure.
all he knows is that it involves some kind of prison transport.
this isn't an outbreak. - It's a jailbreak.
notify the FAA and alert Tactical.
put in a kite-runner to CENTCOM. Find that plane now.
sir, the new information about the cases, how they're connected
at the end of all this, Reddington is the target.
someone's after him. I really think my resignation
it's too late, Agent Keen.
the Director's made his decision. It's over.
agent Keen!
sir, I think I have something.
look at this from Vogel's computer.
your target is Langston Municipal Airport. It's very simple.
if you want to survive, you will complete your task.
another dose of the antidote will arrive after this task is completed.
you will take your break at exactly 2: 55 PM.
all we need are your credentials.
open the door to the server room.
an associate will take it from there.
I need you to come with me.
where? - You need to get in the car.
Why? - You need to get in the car now.
Lizzy, what have you done?
once inside, you will disable the security grid.
the system uses a quantum X storage processor-- multipath IP distribution.
circumvent the firewall at exactly 3: 00 PM.
move, move, move! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
let's go!
we've got
they
sorry.
control, squawk 4-4-6.
4-4-5-6, you are clear to land on Runway C.
proceed to a flight ceiling of 1-8-0-0.
abort, abort, abort, abort, abort! - Go! Go! Go!
runway has been compromised.
abort, abort. Do not land.
they voided your agreement. The deal-- it's off.
you don't have immunity.
and you set this meeting so they could take me.
we need to leave.
Lizzy, you're obviously here now because you sense this meeting was a mistake. Is that true?
we don't have time for this.
this mistake-- I'd like to hear more about it.
Raymond, we have to go.
not until I hear from Agent Keen.
you should wait in the vehicle, Dembe.
we need you two to leave. Let's go.
I'm sorry, Lizzy. Please go on.
you were going to tell me about your change of heart.
tiger Cat 51, you're clear for takeoff.
contact Departure Control when airborne.
Roger. Tiger Cat 51 clear for takeoff.
699, respond to redirection.
your flight plan has been altered under FAA emergency incursion status.
NORAD scrambled a pair of fighter jets.
they're telling us to set down at JFK. - No! No!
they have shoot-to-kill orders.
how long do we have? - 5, 7 minutes, max.
okay, put it down!
down?! - Put it down! Someplace soft.
how do you feel about the East River?
are you crazy? There's no time. We have to go.
what changed, Lizzy? - What are you...
do you want to spend the rest of your life in solitary confinement?
the full force of the FBI is coming for you. - None of that matters.
you want me to tell you you were right, don't you?
that's what this is about.
this is about Sam. - I'm not gonna give you that.
what did you learn about Sam?
I'm not going to forgive you for killing my father.
so, this is where it ends.
I know about the cases, how they're connected, somehow.
Ressler, you need to see this.
who the hell is this guy?
give me the key.
I know about Berlin-- that he's a person, that he's coming for you.
red, the FBI is coming for you.
they're already here, Lizzy.
what are they gonna do to me that hasn't been done before?
kill me?
none of it is worse than losing you.
please excuse the gun.
I'd hate for them to think we're in cahoots.
you don't always get to have your way. You don't get out of this.
drop the weapon now!
there's no way you're out of here! You're surrounded!
you should go.
if this is another one of your games to try to trick me into forgiving you for Sam...
put the weapon down!
...for what you've done...
you have ruined my life.
and I swear to God, right now, I want to kill you.
but there are answers I need, and I can't get them without you.
and I can't get them without you.
so I guess we're stuck with each other.
I was once on the island of Ko Ri, free-diving in the Andaman Sea.
I felt terribly ill-- stung by a lionfish.
I was dehydrated, in excruciating pain.
I had lost all sense of time and place.
I was completely disoriented.
but I knew I was dying, so I readied myself for it.
and in that moment, at death's door, I looked up, and standing over me in the brightness was this landless Moken sea gypsy just standing there, smiling.
she and her tribe nursed me back to health, good as new.
and when I left the island...
she kissed me.
it was like a burst of sunlight on my cheek.
it was...
it made nearly dying well worth it.
that's how I feel now.
tiger Cat 51, you're clear to engage.
Roger. Engaging the target.
now it begins.
everyone on the ground.
hurry up.
on the ground! Now!
6 minutes.
you're late.
how many? - Three.
this is the second time in as many weeks.
everything was very polite -- a few questions, a few answers.
then things got contentious.
this business with your wife, this pursuit, it's pushing you in ways that I don't like.
don't start with me, Kate.
I'll handle my business, you handle yours.
it's Worboliski.
henryk. - It's Warsam.
what happened?
they were hit -- 20 minutes ago.
what do we know? - Professional crew. Military precision.
six minutes in and out.
we have an inventory?
safe-deposit boxes popped, some cash missing.
they're running numbers now.
but you and I both know what they were after.
time to hit the road.
let's go. Let's go.
time to cover our tracks!
notify Dubicki. See if he knows anything about the team.
I want a report within the hour.
interesting.
Mr. Kaplan, I'm sorry.
you're right.
I'm out on the far end of the limb.
take a moment. Read a book.
you will find your wife.
Oh, dear.
Aw, hell.
monarch DOUGLAS BANM
Hello, darling.
listen, you've got it all wrong.
hurting me won't
Reddington doesn't care about me.
it -- it's why I'm in hiding, is to protect my ch-- my child.
you know what? You have such beautiful mouth.
it's perfect.
Lizzy! I'd like to introduce you to my manicurist, Rosa Heredia.
she's the one I was telling you about, who was dating that nine-fingered bullfighter from Juarez.
this woman is an artist, trained at the Latin-American School of Medicine in Havana.
medical school? - Trauma surgeon.
dropped out in the last year of her residency.
your ex-wife -- have you found her?
Jennifer. What have you learned about Jennifer?
I confirmed your daughter was placed in protective custody with her mother in 1990.
the marshal service lost contact seven years ago.
she is unaccounted for.
monarch Douglas Bank. - What?
the preferred bank of international criminals, dictators, terrorists, hedge-fund managers.
they're headquartered here in the U. S. deposits insured by the FDIC, which places them firmly within your agency's jurisdictional bailiwick.
they have branches in 63 countries, but their criminal operation is run out of an unassuming little branch in Warsaw.
and it is the last place on earth that anyone would ever want to rob.
well, less than two hours ago,
monarch's Warsaw branch was assaulted.
what was stolen? - According to the official statement, nothing.
and according to you?
everything.
Dante Stewart, the notorious arms dealer, the Juarez cartel, the entire Marbella crime syndicate.
Reddington claims these are just a few of the criminals who funnel money through Monarch Douglas.
our contacts at Treasury say Monarch's records are spotless.
they're in... full compliance.
despite that, according to Reddington, they're legendary for laundering the money of the criminal elite without any traceable accounting.
there has to be some kind of record.
that must be what they're looking for. - The ledger.
which is apparently more valuable than the millions in assets they left lying in that vault.
well, the bank can't cooperate without implicating itself.
we take down Monarch, we get the names of every criminal who funnels money through them.
I'll contact our legal attache in Poland.
I want you and Ressler on the next flight to Warsaw.
Yes, sir.
everything okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. Just...missed my train.
what?
what is it?
it was at the front desk.
warsaw POLAND - Agent Paul Salerno. - Agents Ressler and Keen.
we've established joint cooperation with the locals, as well as standing extradition orders for any suspects charged, but while you are in-country, you do not have the power to make arrests, and you will, of course, be unarmed.
we had a thorough briefing before we left.
hear you guys are part of some, uh, elite task force?
Where's the vault?
the scene's still being processed.
we're just in time, then.
our sources said that nothing was reported stolen.
your sources were wrong.
Matt Strickland, E. V.P. of branch operations.
agents Ressler and Keen, FBI.
we understand you're headquartered in Manhattan.
I flew out the minute I got the news.
our fault -- snafu in corporate communications.
the first press release was wrong.
they got away with over $400, 000 in bearer bonds.
we're releasing a corrected statement first thing in the morning.
we need access to your data -- operating procedures, your employees.
of course. I'll make arrangements.
anything you need...
I can assure you you'll have our complete cooperation.
thank you, Mr. Strickland.
if you'll excuse me.
what were you thinking with that press release?
the important thing is, The Formula
the Formula is the problem!
the Formula is missing. That means the money is missing.
clients are calling. They're concerned.
if we don't fix this now... we're all dead.
okay.
make me one.
Colonel Yusuf.
no inconsistencies in my witness statements.
they hacked the system, shut it down, deleted everything back to a half-hour before they hit.
what?
Traffic-police services forwarded their feeds.
you got picture? - Yep.
but lousy angle, though. Can't see what went down inside.
but they caught the bad guys coming in and going out.
I'm mirroring the feed now. You seeing this?
Yeah. Got it. Go.
we got five unsubs.
not so fast.
check this out.
six. I got six.
is that right? - Yep.
five went in, six came out.
uh, Aram, can you zoom in on number 4?
copy that.
that's a woman.
she looks scared.
this wasn't a robbery. It was a kidnapping.
there was only one employee who swiped into the Warsaw branch the day of the incident who didn't swipe out -- Kaja Tomczak.
what can you tell us about her? - Nothing, I'm afraid.
as E. V.P.I typically have little contact with branches of this size and no contact with junior account managers.
before robbery, she went home sick.
she must have forgotten to swipe her card on way out.
Oh. Johnny-on-the-spot.
had that one locked and chambered, did we?
I'm sorry -- I do not understand this "Johnny-on-the-spot.
that'll do, Kloza.
this is your American comedy?
shut up!
I'm sorry, Agent Keen.
tensions are running high. We've never been robbed before.
we're gonna need a copy of Kaja Tomczak's employee file.
of course.
the apartment is owned by Monarch?
yes -- this one, five, six more.
employees here on long business trips. Better than hotel.
did you know Miss Tomczak well? - No.
was nice, very nice, but never spoke to her alone.
men are always with her.
men? - Walk her to the door, pick her up.
bring food, take her to work
like guards. Always guards.
Yeah. We'll be right in.
they found the getaway van.
unsubs tried to torch it with some kind of accelerant.
fire burned itself out.
they should've cracked a window.
Hey, you guys see this up here?
is that blood?
I don't think so.
you know that's where people sit, right?
smells like roses.
set a match to it -- see if it burns.
check if it's flammable. - What? Why?
you got a light?
Yeah. It's flammable.
jam.
from the heart of the rum-soaked, rose-petal paczki.
I'm sorry, I don't know what a rum-soaked, rose
it's a jelly doughnut.
lovely. Now what?
now? Nothing. Just get some rest.
I'll be there in less than three hours. Then something.
the copper mine will have to wait. We're going to Warsaw.
your assets are safe. It's a minor systems problem.
I was told Warsaw was hit.
completely unrelated.
this is an I. T. issue that will be resolved within the next few hours.
I'm waiting to take possession of vital cargo that's now sitting in a container ship just off the coast of Mogadishu.
I can't get the cargo until I have a confirmation of a wire transfer I made 36 hours ago.
and we would be more than happy to advance funds.
you talking about a loan?
interest-free, of course.
Mr. Strickland, I think you will come to New York and I will talk to you face-to-face, you will answer all my questions to my satisfaction, all right?
no more food, suka.
my darling.
and Dembe. How is my sweet, gentle boy?
I've been dreaming of paczki.
I tried to curb my cravings in this little shop in the West Village in New York, but they fill them with prune jelly. Can you imagine?
idiota.
tes just like Patty Sutton.
I must admit, Moj droga, I have ulterior motives -- little business.
sales up, business good.
I finish inventory.
then you have something nice to pick from.
and maybe something for my little favorite, too.
my grandmother used to keep flour in the refrigerator. Why is that?
to keep the weevils out.
Oh, of course -- weevils.
it's come to my attention that that the Monarch Douglas Bank was robbed yesterday by some of your... customers.
and if your customers come under scrutiny, Apolonia, your business comes under scrutiny.
Moj boze.
God can't protect you.
but I can.
rece do gory! Hands in the air!
Kaja Tomczak. FBI.
what are you doing here?
good to see you, too.
you're safe now. - I was safe before you got here.
I was trying to escape.
what's the rendezvous point?
the safe house just across the river.
we're sending you the address now.
agent Salerno's on his way.
head toward the Vistula river.
and her associates? Have you identified them?
a Warsaw gang called the Mayerchak Group, known for armed robbery and money laundering.
rough trade for a bank clerk.
get her statement -- I want to know everything she knows before this extradition deal blows up.
if the police know where I am, so does Strickland.
we're doing a threat assessment.
you money men, you love military terms.
your tactics, strategies, your campaigns and hostile takeovers, huh?
now, you promised me that this would all be resolved by now, and it isn't.
do you think I would have flown to New York, met with you personally if I wasn't confident in our handling of the situation?
the situation is fluid. You need to be patient.
I like you, Mr. Strickland.
I like the way you and your people do business.
but I need you to understand
if you bungle this, the people I'm working with, they expect me to set an example
to peel you like a grape.
and I can assure you, as your banker, that your assets are protected by the formula.
the formula.
tell me -- how does she do it?
it's called hyperthymesia
highly superior autobiographical memory.
like a photographic memory.
it's why the bank hired me -- so there wouldn't be any paper trail.
pick a day -- any day, any year.
december 21, 2010.
it was a Tuesday.
I had dry toast for breakfast, bigos for lunch.
I picked up a copy of the Fakt.
two earthquakes -- one in Japan, Bonin Islands, another in Iran, 6.5.
there was a lunar eclipse. - That's incredible.
it could not be seen here, but...
anything interesting?
she drained the accounts of every criminal who had money at that bank.
she keeps it all in her head. That's how the bank does it.
she can give us account numbers, amounts.
who are our friends?
I'm not taking any chances until she's safely turned over to the local police.
out of the question. She's coming back to the States.
you don't make that call.
agent Harold Cooper already did. Perhaps you'd like to spe
a sheet of paper, I-I don't just look at it and remember every word.
I relive it -- the temperature of the room, the light.
the cameras in your apartment, the guards... They were watching you.
for my protection.
then...
you became the prisoner.
I staged it at the bank to ensure there'd be an investigation.
it's over, pal.
who do you work for?
you don't understand the national-security implications of what that woman knows and the damage she can do.
they're coming!
who the hell are you? - Samar Navabi -- Mossad. You're outgunned.
go. I'll cover you. - How do we know we can trust you?
go!
what was that back there?! You almost got me killed!
sorry -- wasn't expecting the mirror to explode 3 feet from my face.
guess it took me a few seconds to regroup.
more than a few. Your reaction time was crap.
bullet fragment. Must have passed through the house on our way out.
okay, I know, I know, I know. Just stay still. Stay still.
my seats.
you're ruining my car.
it's bad? - Yeah, it's bad.
you know I can hear everything you're saying?! - Okay.
okay. Good, good, good, good, good.
you're not going to -- - I need you to stay still, okay?
on the count of three, all right?
what is it?
it's my stomach. I'm -- I'm so sick.
bathroom? - Please.
what's going on? Why are we stopping?
the police. The road is blocked.
they're watching every move. We got to get out of here.
uh, w-where do we go?
how do we get out of here if they're monitoring the streets, the sidewalks?
over here.
let's go.
over here.
there was a bleeding woman in my car... - Shut up!
see?
where did they go?
they ran on that side by the stores.
take him.
there are three of them...
one is bleeding
back by the stores.
hello police.
my car was stolen.
two Americans.
they had... a girl. And she was...
bleeding.
please.
I'm at plac Dionizego Henkla.
please hurry!
what do you mean you're in a stolen car? - We had to!
Salerno's dirty. The safe house was assaulted by a tac team.
and why the hell are we being trailed by Mossad?!
say again? - Samar Navabi?
she took down Salerno, covered our escape. But Kaja's been shot.
listen to me -- you two need to ditch the car, dump your phones, and get off the grid right now.
Where's the nearest landline to their current location?
okay, uh, four blocks ahead, Corner of Stalowa and Srodkowa.
find it. I'll call you there in 10.
got it.
who the hell is Samar Navabi?
Mrs. Reddington! Enough is enough! There's no escape!
and the more time we waste, the harder it's gonna be for you when we find you!
Cooper? - Harold tells me the local police may not be your greatest ally.
get us out of here.
I've reached out to an old friend for assistance.
kaspar Dubicki's my man in Warsaw.
he's waiting for you under the Swietokrzyski bridge
2 12 kilometers east of your current position.
2 12 kilometers is a world away.
there are a million dirty cops between here and there,
and they're all after her.
I've arranged for a small diversion. Just get to Dubicki.
can we trust him?
no. You can trust me.
tell Reddington it is done.
yeah -- big boom.
it's clear.
the tracks run all the way to the bridge.
all right. Hang on.
Mrs. Reddington!
you're a clever girl.
keep that down.
take these. It'll help with the pain.
thank you.
account number 924386.
shell company is Gonzalez Cargo.
what are you doing?
dying declaration.
no. You're not dying -- not today.
I wasn't always a prisoner.
in the beginning, the bank paid me
gave me apartment, a car.
I knew what they were doing
terrorist cartels, organized crime.
but I looked the other way.
I helped them stay in business. I'm no better than they are.
what the hell?
we've got to be 10 minutes out.
Reddington. How did you
enough with the guns.
I love trains. My grandfather rode the rails.
have you ever seen "The General"? Buster Keaton?
Oh, my Goodness.
what are you doing?
Dubicki said the bridge was swarming with police.
we need to move quickly.
and Kaja? - Quite safe, I assure you.
on her way to my Gulfstream.
I'll arrange for an onboard medic to tend to her wounds.
we'll be wheels-up in 20.
I've also booked the two of you first-class tickets home.
no, you can't take her! No!
guys, guys. Enough with the pointing.
don't worry, Donald. They won't shoot you.
but they will restrain you -- rigorously if necessary.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have business to attend to.
be sure they make their flight.
no. No, no.
come on. Let's make some music?
yes?
it's him.
Yeah, hello?
I think it's time we met.
Coney ISLAND
this has been a long time coming.
I hope it's been worth it.
what a terrible waste.
time, blood, money.
and in the end, for what?
revenge.
that's my passion.
revenge isn't a passion -- it's a disease
that eats at your mind and poisons your soul.
I attended summer camp with this little stick of a girl
twila Stansberry.
hell of an athlete -- Capture the Flag.
had an unrelenting passion for fitness.
never skinny enough -- a pound here, a pound there.
ran like a deer.
until she couldn't -- could barely walk.
turns out she was anorexic.
the disease caused her to lose her sight.
I've never known anyone more obsessed with their body than Twila.
spent her entire life chasing something that destroyed her.
make sure your passion isn't your sickness.
your wife is coming apart nicely.
we have a common enemy.
who?
whoever told you that I killed your daughter.
you are finished with my wife.
think so?
Yes, you are.
I have something I suspect you value far more than revenge
your money.
what you're telling me is we have totally lost control of the situation.
Reddington and the witness are gone.
berlin -- gone. Red's wife -- gone.
can any of you tell me one thing that we've got going for us at this point?!
coffee machine still works.
at least it's finally clear now who our perpetrator really is.
is it? Illuminate me.
Reddington. He's the one who put the spotlight on Monarch Douglas.
my guess is, because he had significant funds on deposit.
and once he identified Kaja as their human hard drive...
he put us on her trail, had us deliver her into his custody.
Reddington double-crossed us.
no. He's up to something else.
we need to find that girl, find out where she's being held.
who? - His manicurist.
manicurist? - Well, she was trained as a surgeon.
of course she was.
find her -- now.
I have the girl.
and because I have her, I have control of all your assets at Monarch Douglas.
you're broke.
listen.
hear that?
that's the sound of your checks bouncing
from here to St. Petersburg, from Bangkok to Mozambique.
so, my proposal
your money for my wife.
you can give her back and we can continue this war, or you can kill my wife and I keep your money.
I almost gave up looking for you.
you were like a ghost for 12 years.
heard rumors.
and I followed them -- from Barcelona to Melbourne to Stockholm.
but always nothing.
until one day...
I made a connection.
that's why we're sitting here today
because of Keen.
I know you care for her as much as you care for your wife.
I think underneath it all, under that hat of yours, you're not much different from, uh, Twila Stansberry.
you have the power to destroy me, but you're offering me a way out because you're blinded by passion.
guess we both are.
have your associates set up the meeting. Okay?
Hey, Rosa.
we know you're treating Kaja.
Where's your patient?
I-I don't know
I came alone. I don't want to have to call for backup.
Lizzy. How was your flight?
I know what you're trying to pull, and it's not gonna happen.
what I'm trying to pull? Is that how we speak to each other now
as if I'm some kind of cheap, dime-store confidence man?
bank robber, embezzler, thief.
you put us on this case so you could get to the girl so you could steal Berlin's money.
once she left the bank, the girl was vulnerable.
I simply took advantage of an opportunity.
you're gonna use her to get your wife back.
storybook ending.
not for the thousands of people who are gonna lose their lives because of his actions.
this man is a psychopath!
that money is going to fund terror all over the world, and I'm not gonna let that happen for the sake of one woman.
you don't have a vote.
I found Kaja.
she gave you the routing numbers.
we froze the escrow accounts where you parked Berlin's cash.
my wife will die.
I'm sorry.
no, you're not -- not yet.
maybe someday, if you're very lucky, you might wonder, "At exactly what point did I become this...thing?
but not now. Right now, you're just doing your job.
don't go through with it. We can find another way.
the deal is moving forward.
you can't hold up your end. He'll kill you.
wish me luck.
my wife.
give him the codes.
enter passcode
transaction complete $6. 7 million on deposit from the FBI Wichita field office.
it's linked to Agent Salerno. He was laundering money through that bank.
there is no such person.
the bureau uses Monarch to finance sanctioned operations, including this one.
we're funded through Monarch.
you will purge all records of his role in this matter.
you're not protecting the bank. You're protecting the bureau.
I'm sorry.
for what? - In the taxi in Warsaw.
I came at you pretty hot.
fog of battle.
when Kaja was down, you talked her through the worst of it.
we could have lost her.
you did good.
you're right.
I was amazing.
this is very thorough.
I don't suppose you'd be willing to share your sources
how you came by this information?
I followed leads, exploited a few hairline fractures in the wall that surrounds your operation.
most of it, I gathered myself.
and the rest?
what do you want?
your door was open.
Yes.
thank you.
you're an asset I'm charged with protecting.
I transferred the money to keep you safe.
I was just doing my job.
as far as I'm concerned, every life that that psycho takes from this point forward is on you.
I hope she's worth it.
it's funny.
when I was standing there wondering if you had decided to let me die, a thought struck me
how did you know that Berlin had his money in that bank?
at first, I thought it was the girl -- that she told you.
but the accounts would be coded, moved through shell corporations
layers of protection.
and then I realized, "No. Somebody has a secret Santa.
a source.
Bravo, Lizzy.
when you're ready to share, I'd love to hear.
how do we know Kaja gave up all the accounts at Monarch?
what would possibly motivate her to do otherwise?
a new identity when this is all over
a sizeable contribution to her pension in exchange for protecting you and your friends.
Lizzy, don't be absurd. I don't have any friends.
how did it go?
I'm in.
I look forward to working with you.
well, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
you had to know we would find you.
I didn't run. - Yes.
I could have gone to the police.
and we would have gone to see your beautiful family.
please. There must be another way.
I wasn't sent to negotiate.
please! - Are you crazy?!
I almost killed you, man! - You've got to help me! Please!
calm down, man. Calm down.
there's a man. He's over there.
he's out.
pulse, blood pressure steady.
he's waking up. Let's get him into surgery.
please.
we have a drop site at southeast.
fielding is standing by for the corpse.
how long will you need? - Tell him no more than 40 minutes.
the doctor is scrubbing down.
I need 0. 05 of lorazepam.
let's get a 12-lead EKG, - CBC, BMP. - No! No!
sorry, Mr. Wyatt. You are out of time.
okay! Everybody up! It's 5: 00 A. M.
yo, let's get up. - Sir, don't forget your shoes.
Hey, you! - Let's go!
what happened to your clothes?
Yeah, let's go.
Oh, my God.
looking for this.
I'll scream. - Don't. Listen to me.
Reddington knows where I am.
he found me, and he is coming here, but you need to know that you can't trust him.
he is using you.
and when Berlin is dead, he will kill you.
if you're trying to help me, why don't you put the gun down?
has he told you?
has he told you anything about that night, about the fire?
you need to ask him, Liz, for the truth about why he turned himself in to the FBI.
no. - It's not what you think.
you should have killed him when you had the chance.
go ahead and ask him, Liz. - You should have finished it.
make him answer. You deserve to know the truth.
your father, Naomi Hyland...
red doesn't want you to know that that night, the night of the fire...
what do you want, Agent Keen?
what do you really want?
who are you?! I've seen you following me.
you've seen me at the Millbrook. I'm staying there, too.
I was just... I was just going to the gym.
open up your bag.
open up your bag. Open it up.
what the hell are you doing?
who are you?
I'm sorry.
the Indonesian government has finally agreed to turn over all day-to-day operations at the port to a private company.
I'd like that company to be operated by the syndicate.
that's unlikely. Our logistics company in the region is too small.
I agree.
so I've taken steps to change that.
I'm tripling our investment.
and what if we don't get the contract?
you're fighting a war with Berlin that drags all of us into the trenches with you.
this is a time for caution, not risk.
the fruit is ripe.
Niko, I've made my decision. The men behind you will take you to your car.
Where's Naomi Hyland?
you know, it's hard to say.
I've never been great at reading that woman's emotions.
I need to talk to her. - You want to talk to her...
perhaps some lingering personal questions you think my ex-wife can answer.
you're hiding her from me.
what do you know about Paul Wyatt?
same as everyone else, I guess.
he ran an investment firm but was being investigated by the S. E.C. for fraud.
he was stealing life savings and pensions.
only to turn up with his heart ripped from his chest.
probably by one of his clients.
police say that whoever did it was trying to make a point.
Oh, well, as much as I admire the police for their wonderful sense of irony,
I'm afraid they've got this one wrong.
the man who killed Paul Wyatt wasn't trying to make a point.
he was trying to make a sale.
his name is Dr. James Covington.
a few years ago, he was considered one of the top cardiothoracic surgeons in the country.
now he runs an illegal organ-transplant ring.
his operation, if you'll indulge the term, is one-stop shopping for anyone who needs a life-saving organ transplant ... that includes criminals and wealthy clients who don't happen to be first in line on the recipient list.
so, where do the organs come from? - Oh, that's not your concern.
what matters is that we do our very best to ensure their quality.
if there are complications within the first 10 years, we make every effort to rectify them.
he's harvesting organs...
killing innocent people to sell off their parts?
Lizzy, some of the worst of the worst are still alive because Dr. Covington is saving them.
and you know how to find him?
no. Slushie?
pass. - Oh, my gosh. You have no idea what you're missing.
try a grapefruit gusher. It's just like you today... a little sour.
two grapefruit.
Mr. Reddington was right. Covington was once a respected surgeon...
got his M. D. at Yale, fellowship in cardiothoracic surgery at Vanderbilt.
so what went wrong? - He had some kind of meltdown.
according to this, he falsified a document and stole a set of lungs from the donor pool.
did some kind of experimental operation on a 10-year-old child.
geez. - A few weeks later, the guy who was supposed to receive the transplant died.
the D. A. considered charging Covington, but he was already off the grid.
I want to introduce you to Samar Navabi.
whoa. You're tall.
agent Ressler. Keen.
I believe you two have already met. - In Warsaw.
glad to see you made it out.
agent Navabi is on loan to our task force indefinitely.
you're the one who found Reddington.
I'm sorry. Are those real-time NSA feeds?
I hunted the guy for five years. How long did it take you?
well, it was... uh, 74 days.
we were lucky.
they would kill to see these in Tehran.
how does an Iranian end up working for Mossad?
how did the FBI end up working for Raymond Reddington?
how did you find us in Warsaw? Who told you we were there?
medical examiner just called.
he needs to see you, stat.
how do we know we can trust her? - We don't.
but... she did save our lives.
that buys her some good will, don't you think?
you know Reddington sent her to Warsaw.
there has to be something going on there.
sounds like someone's a little jealous Uncle Red's got a new crush.
Dr. Ryerson, what did you find?
well... I, uh, just completed my autopsy on Mr. Wyatt here.
I was told that... that your theory was that the...
the... the heart was harvested. - It is.
Yeah, well, buy a hat and hang onto it, because, um, that theory may have a little wrinkle.
the incision in his chest was made over a prior midline incision.
tox screen was positive for immunosuppressive drugs, and, um, I am seeing scarring of the aorta.
all of which means what?
well, t... there's... there's residual foreign tissue left behind from when the heart was removed.
this guy had a... a... a previous heart transplant.
the heart that was taken from his chest wasn't his to begin with.
look, I wish I could help, but my life... it's in disarray.
we file for bankruptcy, and now this?
Mrs. Wyatt, we really need you to look at the reports.
we've been over your husband's medical files.
there's no reference to a heart transplant.
I don't know what to say.
we checked. There's no record of your husband ever receiving a donor organ.
they'll kill me if I talk.
unless you talk, there's nothing we can do to protect you.
Dr. James Covington.
your husband was one of his clients?
paul suffered from congestive heart failure. He needed a transplant.
H... he could have waited, put his name on the donor list like everyone else, but not Paul.
we had the money, so he found a way to get the transplant immediately.
he bought a heart from Covington.
yes and no.
the organs that Dr. Covington provides...
they're not available for purchase.
you rent them...
$500, 000 for every year you use the product.
when Paul's business was thriving, that wasn't a problem.
but after the S. E.C. investigation, we couldn't afford to pay.
and if you can't pay, you have to return the product.
excuse me?
my husband's heart wasn't harvested.
it was repossessed.
he'll never convince them to put us in charge of the port.
I don't care what Reddington says. It's reckless.
agreed. The Directorate General may be an ally.
but we all know who makes the decision...
Garong Sundri, the Deputy Minister of Transportation.
he's against us.
and Reddington's investing a fortune in new equipment to change his mind.
this could bankrupt us. - It's a desperate move.
gentlemen. - I'm afraid you've made a mistake, friend.
do you know where you are? - Yes, Niko, I know exactly where I am.
and I know who you work with.
and unfortunately for you,
I work with the one man in the world who doesn't care.
you work for Berlin? What do you want?
berlin sent me with an offer.
if I were you,
I would think of it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
repossessed for nonpayment like a house or a car.
exactly... he killed Paul Wyatt because he didn't get his 500 grand in the annual rental fee.
how does that work, anyway?
once a heart's been transplanted, can it be reused?
Covington didn't kill him to reuse the heart. He did it to send a message.
where I come from, fear is the only deterrent.
I'm from Delaware.
no, I... I'm just saying... I'm actually half-Jewish.
well, a quarter, really. Half-Muslim, too, so...
but, um... Who's counting?
I've been tracking the info we got from Mrs. Wyatt.
according to her, they paid the annual rental fee by making donations to a charity called the Wellbright Fund.
it's a registered 501 nonprofit.
did you pull a tax return, get a list of company expenses?
Yeah, and get this... the fund paid over 200 grand to a Dr. Gordon Albee for consulting services.
consulting on what?
Dr. Albee. - FBI.
sorry. No crime to fight. Poor Norman committed suicide.
you're the medical examiner?
the licensing board has you listed as a general surgeon.
Yeah, well, I wear several hats.
one of those involve consulting for a charity called the Wellbright Fund?
what exactly do you do for the fund?
listen, I'd be happy to help, but, uh, I have an autopsy waiting.
you know, um, if you'd call my office...
they paid you over $200, 000 last year.
call my office.
we've got nothing to charge him with.
and until we do, he's never gonna tell us what we need to know.
Mr. Vargas. Sounds like some shady character in a Humphrey Bogart film.
I like him already.
he said he worked for Berlin.
and his offer?
he said Berlin's opening up a short window.
if we break with you, he'll let us operate under his name.
and you think some of the others were receptive.
the others are supporting you at great risk.
if the port deal goes south, it could bankrupt us.
it's a very fragile proposition.
thank you, Niko.
I appreciate you coming to me with your opinion.
but I'm feeling... bullish.
keep an eye on the others.
if someone intends to defect, I want to be standing right in front of them.
Hello?
I need to talk to him.
I'd like to borrow Mr. Kaplan.
Oh, my God. He wouldn't stop talking.
but I was able to buy us another hour.
we need to wrap this up quickly, though.
he has bowling league at 6: 00.
maybe this was a mistake. - It's not.
you said yourself it would take weeks to secure the necessary court orders, and how many more victims will there be by then?
it's the same as the other three...
heart and lungs are missing.
this one still has a liver, but I see signs of cirrhosis...
probably wasn't healthy enough to be sold.
remember the time we made barley stew with that coroner from Des Moines?
it was Reuben soup.
how can I forgot? I was sleeping with his sister.
that's right.
your Dr. Albee's in a lot of trouble, sweetie.
this should be all you need.
four bodies, Dr. Albee.
you performed an autopsy on all four in the last year.
none of the four were registered organ donors, but all four were missing vital organs. How do you explain that?
fine. I'll answer for you.
you're a supplier for Dr. James Covington.
you provide him with vital organs for him to sell, and he pays you through the Wellbright Fund.
I don't know Covington.
I was approached by an associate I don't know his name...
about providing him with viable material.
you deal with bodies. I thought donor organs had to be fresh.
they do.
it only works in very specific circumstances once I get control of the body as M. E.
how much time do you have? - Depends on the organ I need.
anywhere between 30 to 90 minutes.
you transport them. How?
I call a number.
they send a courier to pick it up.
look, I'll cooperate. I'll do whatever you need.
but you have to protect me.
fine.
but first, you need to make a phone call.
what are the odds that Covington's courier will inspect the organ?
count on it. He's gonna have to make sure the size and weight are a match for their patient.
you don't think that he's gonna notice that he's staring at the heart of a 300-pound hog?
human and porcine hearts are nearly identical.
unless he's got some expertise, he won't be able to tell the difference.
aram just finished the mockup for the medical file on our fictitious donor.
old Porko's got a name.
gustavo Mosquera, 35, no history of heart disease.
killed in a hit-and-run.
time of death... - 30 minutes ago.
aram even generated a social and W-2 in case they run a background check.
what's our E.T.A. for delivery?
within the hour.
my men captured this two hours ago.
titillating.
but what Laskin and Russo do with or to one another in their spare time is none of my concern.
right, except a minute later...
a threesome? Interesting.
based on his sartorial splendor, I gather this is Mr. Vargas.
does that even look like real hair?
we have to assume they accepted his offer and cut the deal with Berlin.
why assume, Niko, when I can ask them myself?
I just sent you an image of a man who matches our suspect's description.
got it. I am processing him through the database now.
how much time do we have?
two hours viability max. Here's his file.
ronald Cassell. Check fraud, theft, battery.
but he does have some medical training...
former army combat medic out of Fort Drum.
everything checks out here. It's a match for our client.
excellent. I'll see you in 20 minutes.
good news, Mr. Babbitt. We're ready to begin.
heads up, everybody. Target's on the move.
Ressler, he's headed towards the front door.
of course it's a motorcycle.
he made me.
I'm gonna head him off. Hang on.
doctor, we have a problem.
go, go, go.
go, go, go, go.
gentlemen, thank you for meeting me on such short notice.
I know you two have had a very busy day.
nothing out of the ordinary.
I hear you boys engaged in a little tryst downtown this morning.
we had a meeting at the Corgate.
this an interrogation? - Yes.
I understand an offer was made by Berlin's representative.
red, look... - What I don't understand is why only one of my associates thought to bring that to my attention.
we didn't tell because there's nothing to tell.
J. P. I'm delighted you were able to hold dear Teddy's hand and help him overcome all his anxieties about me bankrupting our operation.
I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't concerned about this deal.
if I were you, Teddy, I'd be more concerned about the plans these gentlemen have for your immediate future.
what? What? What are you doing? - Wait a minute.
stop! Red, Red! - What's going on?
come on!
what the hell? Don't do this. Don't...
let me go!
we just lost our only lead to Covington.
maybe there's another way.
I just found this on Cassell.
it's a medical file of Covington's next client.
the one who's getting the pig's heart? Who is it?
his name is Bernard Babbitt.
bernard Babbitt, known as "B. B."
runs the Desobry Syndicate out of New Orleans moving drugs and weapons through the Fourchon.
Bureau's been trying to indict him on racketeering and murder charges for years.
so, you know him? - Know him?
Oh, my gosh.
I once shared a ride with the man on a twin-engine prop from Port-Au-Prince to Baracoa.
we had to counterweight the plane with three containers of Russian R. P.G. s just to accommodate his girth.
I would have thought he'd be more cautious about where he chooses to hang out.
well, B. B.'s an indulgent man.
he loves to be surrounded with what he loves the most.
just like a bear at a campsite.
you poor thing.
honestly, I don't know how you do it.
it boggles the imagination.
red.
I suppose it isn't any wonder you can justify cramming all this grease-drenched gristle into your face given that you've already paid to replace that rotted nub you call a heart.
how's that going, by the way?
I heard you had a setback... a problem with the donor not coming through?
give us a moment, mouche miel.
what do you want, Reddington?
the good Dr. Covington... he and I need to have a conversation.
and since you happen to be in touch, I thought you could connect us.
B. B... Surely you have some way to get a hold of the man.
you're in his care.
I have a number. But strictly for emergencies.
so I sure as hell ain't giving it to you.
last thing I need to do is piss this guy off before he cuts my chest open.
talk to me after my surgery.
B. B. you don't look well. Are you all right?
let me guess... irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, perhaps a little tingling in your nether regions?
what the hell are you doing?
those drinks you've been enjoying on the house?
they weren't from the house. They were from me.
I hope you don't mind. I took the liberty of adding a special surprise ingredient something to treat any localized dysfunction you may be suffering.
has the little man been falling down on the job?
it's a miracle drug, not so much for a glutton with a bum heart, however.
but look on the bright side... you'll die with a marvelous erection.
I can't... I can't breathe.
well, the two gentlemen behind me happen to be paramedics.
put me in touch with Covington, they'll be happy to assist you.
what do you think, B. B?
does this feel like an emergency?
you wanted to see me?
close the door.
I got the psych evals back from Dr. Friedman.
she has some concerns. - Oh, Ressler. Yeah.
she wanted to suspend him because he was... - She has no problem with Ressler.
it's you she's concerned about. - Well, that's ridiculous. I'm fine.
that's what she's concerned about.
and frankly, I am, too.
you're concerned that I'm fine.
that you didn't mourn or take time off to grieve...
not for your marriage, but for yourself, for what Keen put you through.
I will mourn when we get Berlin.
Dr. Friedman recommended a one-month paid leave.
fine. It will give me more time to hunt Berlin.
I'm not taking the doctor's recommendation.
but I am concerned. The investigation's ongoing, and you and I both know there's a good chance Tom Keen is alive.
what that's done to you, how you've coped, the hotel rooms...
your paranoia is understandable, but I'm worried it could become a problem.
well, I appreciate your concern, but I am doing the best I can to handle this.
Elizabeth... I'm not criticizing you.
if I were in your shoes...
I only want you to know that if you feel like you're under water, if you need to talk, my door is open.
thank you.
it's Reddington.
Hey. Did you get a lead on Covington?
what are we looking at? - We've got a number on Covington.
Aram's working a trace. - It's a digital VoIP line.
uh, man, this thing is getting bounced all over the globe to mask its origin.
the line just went active.
Covington's making a call.
what the hell happened to Cassell?
okay, hold on. If he stays on the line just a few more seconds, I'll have an address.
I need you here. We have a removal at 5: 00.
all right. I'm on my way in now. - Oh, no, no, no, no. Damn it.
I was only able to narrow his location down to this five-block area.
he said he had a removal. He's gonna repossess another organ.
well, we got to move.
if we don't find Covington in 43 minutes, we're gonna find another body.
is that the 5-7 you've been raving about?
indeed. See for yourself.
polymer over steel, ambidextrous controls.
be right with you.
we've been through this.
berlin prefers firearms manufactured in Russia or Eastern Europe.
just give me the same shipment as last time.
my apologies.
I expected to have that all wrapped up before you arrived.
where are we?
it's done. - Reddington bought the photo op?
I didn't even need to present real evidence his men had betrayed him.
he has become reckless, unstable.
it seems our arrangement is off to a promising start.
regarding that arrangement,
I think we need to revisit the terms.
I betrayed Raymond Reddington.
he is not gonna just absorb that blow and move on.
I need him taken care of.
if Berlin wanted Reddington dead, he would have done that already.
Yeah, well, things have changed.
you're doing business with me now.
I know everything about Reddington's operation, and I'm willing to hand over all of that to your employer, but I need Reddington gone.
I can't be an effective partner to Berlin if I'm always looking over my shoulder.
set a meeting with Reddington.
my people will take care of the rest.
landlord's still not answering.
this has to be the place.
we've been to every retail store, office park, and restaurant in the area.
we got 20 minutes till Covington kills his next victim.
what are you doing?
I like to keep a spare key in the trunk.
Hey. Anything?
a whole lot of nothing.
Hey, Keen. Look at this.
we got a stairway to the lower level. - Lower level?
Yeah. There's some kind of access stairway.
the building plans filed with the city don't say anything about a lower level.
hands. Hands. Let me see your hands.
you can't be in here.
I got this.
wait, sir. Look, don't go in there. - Sit down.
please. I'm begging you. - I said, "sit."
back away from the table.
I don't know who the hell you are...
hands in the air! Step away from the table now!
you don't know what you're doing.
it's over, Dr. Covington. We know about your business.
you lost your license for performing an experimental operation on a child.
well, not this one. Not today.
I'm not trying to hurt the boy. I'm trying to save him.
his name is Daniel.
if he doesn't get these lungs in the next 24 hours, he won't survive.
he needs to be in a hospital. - It's too late for that.
I'm performing this operation.
if you want to stop me, you'll have to shoot me.
won't be a problem.
there are strict rules controlling who gets access to donor organs and when.
in the present system, they offer adult donor lungs to adults, even if there are children with a more urgent need.
I'm not discussing this with you.
I took adult lungs and transplanted them into a little girl.
that's why I lost my license for saving her life.
so you know better?
okay, putting adult lungs into children is a risk.
but I believe, in many cases, we have an obligation to try.
and I'm not the only one. Times are changing.
there's even an official appeals process for these cases now.
then his parents can request an exception to the rule.
and risk being turned down.
at least here, I guarantee him a chance.
you killed Paul Wyatt. You ripped the heart out of his chest.
look, you can think whatever you want about me, but every dime I've made on criminals like Paul Wyatt has been spent to build and operate this place.
all that matters today is that there will be no tomorrow for this boy if I don't do this transplant.
the donor material is already here.
if we don't use it, it will die, just like he will.
if we take him in now, that kid won't make it.
can you live with that?
Covington's not just a surgeon, Keen. He's a killer.
Yeah, and right now, he's that boy's only chance.
look at his parents. What if that were your kid?
and what if something goes wrong?
what if he dies on the table? How do we explain that?
can you cover with Cooper and Aram? Just buy us some time.
Liz, this is way over the line.
we have to let him do this.
Niko, you're all in a sweat.
what's so important that it couldn't wait?
we've been partners a long time, and we've had more than our share of success, so I wanted to pay you the courtesy of looking you in the eye when I tell you you're out.
I see.
and you're speaking for... ?
everybody. We're united.
you've become a liability.
don't forget who you're talking to.
how could I?
especially since it's our last conversation.
Raymond Reddington, Mr. Vargas.
I may have misled you.
someone did take Berlin up on his offer, but it wasn't Laskin and Russo. It was me.
well played, Niko.
I didn't think you had it in you.
kill him.
I find chrome to be a bit ostentatious.
I'm sorry, Mr. Demakis.
the truth is I'm the one who misled you.
you know, when I was 15, I had a summer job installing carpets for Albert Kodagolian on Lake Charlevoix.
horrible job...
hot, indoors, forced to listen to "The Gambler" on 8-track while the rest of the world was at the beach.
three days into the job, I knew I had to quit.
I asked my father for advice.
all he wanted to know was whether I'd given my word to Mr. Kodagolian that I'd work the summer.
I told him I had.
my father suggested I stick it out.
I'd given my word.
worst eight weeks of my life.
until the last day.
Mr. Kodagolian shows up at the jobsite, pulls me aside, and tells me that in 27 years, no kid has ever made it through the summer, gives me a bonus... $40.
the most valuable money I've ever made.
a priceless lesson about life.
value loyalty above all else.
Oh! I buried the lead.
turns out the Indonesian government has chosen to contract our company to run the port of Tankulu.
the Deputy Minister of Transportation was not a fan.
fortunately, he was also gravely ill and in desperate need of a heart transplant.
he died this morning.
apparently, the arrangements he'd made to secure a donor heart didn't pan out.
the new deputy minister sees things our way.
lucky, I guess.
I don't believe luck had anything to do with it.
you're right. Luck rarely has anything to do with it.
honestly, how many times have we discussed this?
what?
you... you know I don't like being around the bloody st...
I need to be allowed to leave the room before the blood.
you know I don't have a strong constitution.
give him his seat. He's gonna faint.
Oh, my.
thank you.
Hey, you think Reddington knew that Covington was trying to save kids?
for every child Covington saved, there were three killers like B. B.
he kept alive to victimize innocent people.
it's a trade-off I'd make.
the fact that you're even thinking about what trade-offs you'd make, what rules you'd ignore...
the Agent Keen I met a year ago would have never done that.
you caught Covington, and the child is in recovery.
it sounds like a victory.
Yeah.
you guys don't celebrate when you close a big case?
come on. Let me buy you a drink.
Thanks, but I think I'm just gonna head out.
all you know about me is that I found Reddington and whatever you might have read in a slim dossier.
and now we're working together with all that that implies.
I'm sure you don't know what to think.
you're wrong. - I'm not wrong.
you're right not to trust me.
Oh, you're right about that.
you're wrong if you think you found Reddington.
if he was found, it's because he wanted to be and he wanted you to find him.
or maybe I'm just good at what I do.
is that so difficult to believe?
if he wanted you here, he has a reason.
that's why I don't trust you...
because I don't know what the reason is and I'm guessing neither do you.
Hey, sir?
look, I'm sorry about that incident with the, um, frisking.
don't worry about it.
so, is that your thing unprovoked frisking?
Yeah. That's my thing.
I'm a federal agent.
figured it would be something like that.
better safe than sorry, right?
have a good night. - You, too.
you look so different.
not as different as you.
I had to take it.
I mean, have you really thought about what he's gonna do?
everyone is gonna die... Everyone.
you did the right thing.
I'm gonna go to the police. I have to go to the police.
I'm gonna give it to them. If I don't, if he goes through with it...
if he finds you, he might hurt you again.
I'll come with you. Just... Tell me where you are.
just promise me you'll come alone.
I promise.
24 hour
I'm sorry.
where is it?
you get away from me.
you can't stop us now. Everything is in place. It's too late.
you get away from me.
I always thought you were different.
but you're just like the rest. You're selfish.
give it to me. - No.
help! Somebody call an ambulance!
that's crazy, man. I'm just like,"whoa.
she just stepped out. She jumped in front of that car.
I told you to get rid of him.
Lizzy, I'm not getting rid of him.
your safety is of great concern to me.
Yeah, I can handle myself. I just... I don't want him watching me.
what is all this?
there was an incident this morning in Dupont Circle.
a woman was struck by a taxi...
Maddox Beck's wife?
Yes. The leaders of the Front.
well, how is that possible?
they died trying to bomb BP's London Office in response to the Gulf oil spill.
so the world believes.
in truth, they took their work underground.
personally, I once admired Carrie Ann.
however, since going underground, they've become too radical for my blood, advocates for a level of destruction that... I find chilling.
so who killed her?
I believe her husband is responsible.
I don't understand. Weren't they partners?
didn't they found the Front together?
Yes, but their partnership was a tenuous one.
she was always the more moderate voice, only interested in operations that related directly to the environment.
Beck, on the other hand, views himself as a chosen one, a messianic figure who sees humanity as a virus that needs to be eradicated in order to save the planet.
I fear he got rid of his wife because she was trying to stop him from implementing a plan to do just that.
these are the last known photographs of Maddox Beck and his wife.
they're the founders of the Front.
2012... Firebomb strikes a biotech park in Boston, conducting genomics research, causing $64 million in damage.
2013... Four staff members were killed and 16 hospitalized.
ricin was mailed to the Fairbanks BLM Office, which manages transatlantic pipeline.
just got off with the M. E.
he'll have a tox work-up on Beck's wife within the hour.
we can't assume Beck killed her just because Reddington says so.
get to the morgue. I want a cause of death.
her body's not at the morgue. She's at City Memorial.
labor and delivery.
she was pregnant?
Yeah, 30 weeks.
from what they can tell, the... The baby's fine.
and the mother?
the doctors declared her brain dead.
they put her on life support until they can safely deliver the... The child.
most of the injuries were sustained, uh, during the accident, but she suffered some injuries beforehand, as well...
lacerations to the... The head and the hands and, and, um, defensive bruises on the forearms.
think he beat her?
I think she was in one hell of a fight.
you say in your notes she had clay under her fingernails?
clay? From where? That's odd, isn't it?
the really odd part is that the... The clay is 700 years old.
the soil found under the nails of Carrie Ann Beck dates back to the 14th century.
it's called Raw Sienna.
okay, so, what's it doing there?
raw Sienna was used by painters at the time, painters who belonged to what's known as the Sienese School.
the Prado in Madrid has an exhibit going on right now featuring paintings from the Sienese School.
last week, one of those paintings was stolen.
that's what she and Beck were fighting over, this painting.
maybe they were trying to sell it on the black market, fund their operation.
there were 22 paintings at the exhibit.
the one that was stolen had been on loan from the Santa Caterina Church in Pisa, and it was, by far, the least valuable.
then why did they steal it?
department
come on!
number 76.
number 76!
I've been busting my ass!
and now you fire me because I'm not, what, fast enough?!
I'll need all your research. - No!
and any leads as to her whereabouts.
you want me to find the girl? I'll find the girl.
but these things take time!
you don't have any leads.
you know what? I don't have time!
and yet you've had me waiting out there for over 45 minutes!
do you know the vending machine is broken?
it's as if you enjoy making people miserable!
I work at the DMV!
if you can't do this, I need to find someone who can.
everything rests on finding the girl.
I understand, and I'm trying my best.
but you didn't give me much to go on, and I've had some...
is something wrong? - You know what?
just forget it!
talk to me.
it's mom.
three months ago, she was in the shower, noticed this... Lump.
how bad? - Got into her bones.
they bombarded her with chemo.
we've tried everything... The pills and the diets, biofeedback, music therapy, the Flaxseed diet.
flax seed? - Part of the Budwig protocol.
I don't have time for this. - Oh, I'm sorry!
has mom's illness cramped your busy schedule?!
every time you can't deliver, you do this... These cockamamie stories!
my mother is dying!
Yes, and your brother-in-law had legionnaires disease, and your house was flooded, and I'm still no closer to finding the girl.
get out!
you're the most gifted tracker I know, Glen, but your mouth runs like a scalded dog.
I don't know why you're mad at me.
you're the one who came up short.
codes. What kind of codes?
you mean written on the back of the painting?
not on the back... Under the paint.
the museum sent us everything they had on the stolen painting.
when it was acquired last year, they ran a series of tests to determine its authenticity.
Yeah, they used thermal imaging to do microscopic and spectroscopic analysis and found this.
what's it mean?- Museum doesn't know. I spoke with the curator.
call the National Gallery. Get Lillian Sharp in here.
if anyone can make heads or tails of this, she can.
keen... Where is she?
she had an appointment.
look, when I agreed to do this, I...
it's just taking longer than I thought.
is he out there? - Yeah. I'm going out back.
this is for last week.
do it one more week, and I'll pay you double.
I'll be back in one hour.
it's a map. - A map to what?
a bedtime story.
it's a legend about the Apophis Strain, an ancient plague weaponized in the 14th century by both the Byzantines and the Ottomans that was mistakenly released and believed to be the real origin of the black death.
you're talking about the bubonic plague.
no... Pneumonic plague, which is airborne and far more fatal.
scientists now believe that was the plague that killed 200 million people, one of the largest pandemics in history.
that's why, to prevent armageddon, the sworn enemies agreed to task four priests to take the strain to the end of the world.
and this map indicates in which end of the world it's hidden.
agent Cooper, you're not taking this seriously, are you?
Maddox Beck is.
he killed his wife to get this map.
these symbols... Trust me. This map is worthless.
Thursday. Same time?
Lizzy, I need to see you. There's been a development.
this map is priceless. You need to move on this now.
if the Apophis Strain is out there...
you didn't tell this to the FBI?
Lillian is paid to embargo certain key details from your colleagues if she believes they may be of interest to me.
you sure she can be trusted?
I could say the same thing about you. - Ladies, please.
I'm surprised the two of you haven't met at a conference or company retreat.
does the FBI do a Christmas party?
one of the priests sent to guard the strain got sick.
and to protect it, the dying man swallowed it whole, taking it to his grave.
we know this because the others survived and created the map.
and the markings? What do they mean?
they're archetypal alignments.
when you connect them, they create lay lines linking a network of historically significant sites.
you said the priests were sent to the end of the world.
where? - Well, I said it was the end of the world...
not anymore. If I'm reading this correctly, the strain is buried here... in America.
red's source says the map points to Burial Ridge in Staten Island.
it's the largest native American burial ground in New York.
we've contacted local authorities. We're on our way now.
I-I don't know how to break this to you, but, Beck beat you there.
what are you talking about?
new York Field Office got called in on a grave robbery.
according to park police, our guy, Beck, he knew exactly where to look.
the bones contain the DNA of the plague.
once he has it, he can replicate it.
that's why he took the bones.
no, he wanted to take them, but according to park police, whoever was buried there was moved.
hundreds of years ago.
I'm sending you an image of what was left in its place.
got it. - We think it's a marker, some sort of addendum to the map.
it's Cyrillic.
it's ancient Cyrillic. It looks like some sort of equation.
P" equals 100.
o" that sort of looks like a ribbon equals 9.
those dash symbols in between denotes that the number to the right should be multiplied by 1, 000.
it totals 109, 120.
probably a measurement. Is there a standard form?
cubits.
uh, one cubit is half a yard.
109, 120 cubits is 54, 560 yards.
what? I was good at math.
there's another engraving here. Looks like, what, a moon?
or a sun, which rises in the east.
the strain's final resting place.
54, 560 yards or exactly 31 miles.
Hello, Aram. Agent Navabi.
you certainly look radiant.
Mr. Reddington. Um...
if you're looking for, uh, A-Agent Keen...
I'm not. I'm looking for you.
Aram, are you there? What is it?
what's 31 miles east of Burial Ridge?
this is the oldest church in the city.
the graves in the church, they're sacrosanct.
is there another way in here?
the southeast stairwell, behind the... - Show me.
you want me to find a girl.
you can't tell me her name, and none of the other people who work for you were able to find her.
Yes.
that's not much to go on.
it's not.
out of curiosity, the other people who couldn't find her, this... Girl...
W-what... What did you do to them?
Aram, this woman is critical in my war with Berlin.
FBI! don't move!
you know what I have in here.
you wouldn't be here if you didn't.
put it down.
it's incredible, isn't it?
finding America a century before Columbus, surviving, protecting the secret.
his life had one purpose... The plague.
you're not walking out of here.
do you know how contagious this is?
shoot me, I drop it, and then we're both infected.
I said put it down.
either you let me go, or we both die.
the choice is yours.
you're just like everybody else.
you're gonna save your life at the expense of millions of others.
is that why you killed your wife?
Carrie Ann killed herself.
she wasn't able to go through with it, but somebody needs to have the courage to do what's necessary.
radio Foster. Tell him we're on our way.
they have it. It's gone.
the plague, it's gone.
call state and local police.
tell them we want lookouts and checkpoints at every highway leading out of the city.
find Maddox Beck!
you had him. - He was in possession of the strain.
did you hesitate or not?
he threatened to release it.
and now a mad man is out there with the ability to start a pandemic.
enough.
if it's the pneumonic plague, there are antibiotics, protocols.
for the strain that exists today, not the one that's 700 years old.
we have to assume that there is no cure for whatever Beck got his hands on.
I said that's enough.
this is unbelievable.
alert the CDC. Tell them that a potential category 5 threat has just been identified with no cure and a high probability of exposure.
agent Keen.
whatever decision you made, I'm sure it was the right one.
I've seen you under pressure in the moment.
thank you. - I mean it.
the way you handle... take Mr. Reddington, for example.
he asked me to do one thing, and I freeze up, but you're always able to...
what? What? What are you talking about?
Oh, wait. Uh, no, just, um... You're solid.
Reddington asked you to do... - No, forget that... Bad example.
what did Reddington ask you to do?
that is the exact number of species that grows extinct every year.
that is 10, 000 times the natural rate of extinction, and one species is responsible.
ours.
the reason that we are making the ultimate sacrifice...
is because earth is literally dying.
everybody knows it, and no one will do anything about it.
to preserve life on earth, we need to become...
extinct.
it's time.
your wife made it perfectly clear your daughter has no interest in seeing you.
Oh, dear. - The FBI is not in the business of handling your personal affairs.
the FBI is in the business of my business.
why else would I be in business with the FBI?
if she is in danger, we will protect her, either from Berlin or you.
who told you she's my daughter?
you have no right to have anything to do with that girl, not since the night you abandoned her.
I'm touched.
you just upended your ex-wife's entire life.
I'm not gonna let you do the same thing to her.
as a rule, I consider jealousy to be a base emotion.
but in this case, it's quite endearing.
Oh, God. I am not jealous.
I assure you, Lizzy, my quest to find this young woman will in no way compromise our relationship.
our relationship"?
where are we on the case? - No, no, no. We're not doing that.
I understand you lost Beck. It must be disheartening.
let me be perfectly clear.
aram is not going to help you find your daughter.
and the guy you have following me...
either you get rid of him, or I will.
it's about agent Keen.
what's up? - She seems unusually agitated.
I'm not sure why, but I believe she's hiding something from me.
hiding what? - I'm not sure.
but I think she's worried you may expose her.
she's made it clear she wants you gone.
I told her that's not an option.
I think she may try to manipulate the situation.
don't worry. I've got eyes on her as we speak.
she's not going anywhere.
it's all well. I'll be handling, sir.
don't.
bite me!
you think it's a good idea you being here this time of night?
I need to go inside.
girl, you're pushing it.
can I go inside?
can you feel it?
Yes. I can feel it inside me.
I can feel it growing.
Amen.
unconfirmed reports indicate hundreds have been infected as a result of the outbreak.
the Capitol and the Supreme Court have been evacuated.
metro police have quarantined a 15-block area, reaching from constitution to Pennsylvania Avenue.
patient Zero has been I. D.'d as Sharon McManus.
prelim autopsy confirms we are dealing with a genetically modified strain of pneumonic plague.
modified how? - We have no idea, but it is working at an accelerated rate.
people in the quarantine, none of them look sick yet.
from what the CDC can tell, the contagion works in three phases, the first of which is incubation.
right now, it is dormant in their immune systems.
it is not airborne yet, but that is only going to last for the first few hours.
then what? - It turns the victim symptomatic, then infectious.
based on what we can tell from the time of death and the rapid depletion of Patient Zero's target cells, those healthy-looking people will be dead in nine hours.
how many people are we talking about?
roughly 2, 300 in quarantine, sir.
talk to me about the treatment protocols. - There are none.
in order to understand how the disease was altered, to find a cure, we need a sample of the original strain.
and Beck has the only one.
Hey. Full E. R.T. report on Patient Zero's effects just came in.
they found this on the victim's shirt...
hair from a rodent, a rat species specifically bred for scientific purposes.
Rattus norvegicus.
there are only two licensed suppliers for clinical trials.
and in the last month, they've only had one shipment that didn't go to a university or research facility.
you got Beck's shipping address.
two story property in Thurmont.
send the Biohazard team at Quantico.
clear!
I need you to come in.
I found your girl.
number 84.
the picture you gave me, the one of the girl...
I had it aged up in the system and marked as an FBI inquiry five weeks ago.
the vending machine is still not working.
then Dolly goes in for hair plugs.
she's the only one in the Southwest Service Center with access,
the woman grading the written tests needs to shower.
but this morning, Dolly comes back, and guess what.
old Dolly got a hit...
a 97% match on your girl.
as I said, these things take time.
what the hell is that?
it's a new vending machine. Yours is broken.
consider it a bonus.
the equipment looks like it's been used recently.
my God.
D. C. was just the beginning.
24 cities. On every continent.
they're gonna be on planes.
Aram, get me the FAA.
when an organism is ill, it develops antibodies to combat the illness.
nature creates the instruments to eradicate deadly disease.
in this case, the disease is humanity.
we're the antidotes.
climate change, water shortages, a population approaching eight billion...
we won't live to see it.
and there will be no one left to remember.
but our sacrifice will usher in the dawn of a new earth.
Sharon began our crusade,
to a new day.
to a new day.
cdc quarantined a vehicle found at Dulles.
there was an inhaler mask discovered outside of the car.
we won't have the official results for a few hours, but the toxins inside appear to match those found in Beck's lab.
vehicle's owner was one Ron Crocker,
every passenger on that flight will be infected.
we have Crocker's travel profile? - Yeah.
okay. Uh, one-way ticket, traveling alone, no checked baggage.
ticket purchased within the last eight hours.
can you apply the same criteria to passengers on flights from Dulles to the other target cities?
every matching profile is a potential follower infected with the plague.
okay, 31 matches.
of those... Seven are business travelers who made last-minute reservations using corporate cards.
are they already in flight? - All but one...
Chris Perez. Leaves Dulles for Toronto within one hour.
probably still in the incubation period.
we can take him down, isolate him before he boards.
you work with Aram. Notify the FAA of those infected flights.
you get to Dulles, make sure Perez does not get on that flight.
final boarding for flight 428, service to Toronto, please proceed to gate A17.
we've located four of the suspects.
two land in 45 minutes... Moscow and Sao Paulo.
get word to the air marshals on board.
have teams on the Tarmacs ready to quarantine those planes.
contact the TSA and have them patch us into the airport security feeds.
we have to assume the passengers are all infected.
quarantine won't help them, only the cure.
which we don't have.
follow me, please.
coming through! - Make way! Federal agents coming through!
stand aside, please!
coming through here! Federal agents!
he's not at the gate.
Aram, you got eyes?
looking. Looking now.
I'm gonna double back. - Okay.
come on.
go back... There.
that's him. There he is.
a black jacket with a gray hoodie, a green shoulder bag.
near gate C-13.
what's going on?
officer down! I need a medic!
you can't come in here.
samar, you're gonna bleed out! You've got to open this door!
it's out. I'm infected.
if you come in here, you will be, too.
you'll be okay.
18 of the flights have been quarantined, and the suspects have been arrested.
the others... Diverted with military escorts.
what about the infected?
Liz and Samar... How much time do they have?
worst-case scenario... Eight hours.
I was able to trace a credit card tied to the plane tickets Beck purchased, but he created a VPN.
the computer he used accessed the Internet within a 50-mile radius of Abingdon.
get our people in Virginia the coordinates have them start a canvass.
and the radius... Narrow it down.
Mr. Reddington, I-I'm calling about Agent Keen.
circumstances have changed, Aram. I found what I was looking for.
you have? I mean, uh, you have. That's so... That's fantastic.
but, uh, that's actually... That's not why I'm calling.
uh, Agent Keen, she and Agent Navabi, they've been infected.
when? - Just over an hour ago.
where are you on Beck?
he's somewhere outside Abingdon, but I don't know where.
I've searched the public record... Uh, tax bills, power, phone.
it's like... It's like he lives off the grid.
well, there you have it.
have what?
Hello?
what?
mm, nothing.
what made you smile?
nipple guards.
a year ago, I,uh...
Tom and I, we were going to adopt a newborn, and we were having a baby shower.
and one of the guests, this teacher, she brought nipple guards.
did she know you were adopting? - Uh, exactly, yes, she...
it was like she was reminding me that I wasn't pregnant.
I was just so pissed. I didn't even thank her.
God, I wish I could just go back and thank her.
I had it all figured out.
I was gonna have a baby...
and a husband.
and then he showed up.
you know everyone talks about it, right?
they don't want to bring it up with you.
why you? Who is he to you?
Reddington is...
the bane of my existence.
and yet, here he is, trying to reconnect with his daughter?
trying to find her?
and I find myself feeling possessive.
possessive of him, jealous of the girl he's trying to protect.
and if that's not embarrassing enough, that's exactly how he predicted I'd feel.
you think they've delivered that baby yet? Carrie Ann Beck's?
that's probably why she backed out, right?
because of that baby. - Mm-hmm.
and when they find a cure, when we walk out of here, it'll all be because of that baby.
Hey. Uh, I figured it out.
technically, Mr. Reddington figured it out, but I think I know where Beck is.
he's a radical environmentalist, so any electricity would be solar.
we have a 50-mile search area. That could be dozens of houses.
using grid-tied power.
but people who want to sever ties with the government, they would use off-grid systems, which are very uncommon.
how uncommon? - I could only find one with the capability to support a compound large enough for Beck and his followers.
um, I should mention... I'm pretty sure Mr. Reddington has a head start.
pepper, what's...
you two out here playing grab-ass in the woods just smacks of something biblical.
who the hell are you?
I'm the snake in the grass.
I was a big fan of yours at one time.
I remember you in that little, inflatable boat in the North Sea, going up against that oil platform, huge waves tossing you up against the pilings, fire hoses and steel oil drums raining down from above.
my God, it gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.
then I had the good fortune of sharing a cell in a prison outside Sochi
big bear of a man, 150 kilos on an empty belly.
as I remember it, Yevgeny went on hunger strike to protest some oil pipeline that threatened a vital something-or-other.
you probably remember better than I.
but the point is the old boy didn't eat for 74 days.
imagine that.
I wouldn't have the discipline.
my weakness is sausage and Peppers.
but Yevgeny...
he did it.
wasted away like Christ on the cross, dying for a cause...
your cause.
and I remember thinking that the only men I've known that have people who are willing to die for their cause are either saints or megalomaniacs.
and you... Are no Saint.
which is why I'm not surprised to find you and Pepper waiting out armageddon here in Eden.
you and I both know you're not gonna die for your cause.
put that down.
you dig up a plague, hatch a plan to spread it around the world, but before you do, you synthesize a cure...
for yourself and your Eve.
ironic, isn't it.
if you were half as dedicated to your cause as Yevgeny was, there would be no vaccine,
I wouldn't be here, and you and Pepper would be free to romp like bunnies until the convulsing and hemorrhaging started.
you're wrong. My actions are about our crimes against the earth.
I'll be frank, Mr. Beck, because I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I'm not here for you.
I think you know what I'm about to ask for.
what's he talking about?
you never told him?
told me what?
where is it?
please. don't.
never told me what?
we don't have much time.
my business is finished here.
I'll leave the two of you. I'm sure you have plenty to discuss.
just got off with the CDC. They've started vaccine protocol.
all quarantined victims have been treated, along with the passengers from those flights.
the girl, Carrie Anne Beck... She was taken off life support.
notify her next of kin.
tell them about the child.
cumbernauld, '55.
I believe you were staring at me.
was I?
so...
are you going to keep staring...
...or are you buying me a drink?
keys. - Where.
right pocket.
I've told you everything I know.
you've given me pieces. You've helped around the margins, but I need more. I need Berlin!
how much do you think I can do from in here, Liz, chained to the floor?
you need to let me go, and then I can help you.
the arms supplier... I want a name.
I can try to reach out to Berlin, but as long as I am in here, I can't.
I want a name!
what month is it?
november.
well, happy anniversary, Liz.
you go to Passionfish to celebrate?
I'm gonna freeze to death down here.
you know that, right?
he runs arms for Berlin. He'd be able to set a meeting.
that wasn't so hard, was it?
so, what exactly did Reddington say?
uh, it was Dembe. He said Red had another case but he specifically asked that you come along.
does that bother you? - Why would it?
I thought he only spoke to you.
don't want to step on your toes.
I'm... fine. My toes are fine.
Ah, ladies, thank God you showed up.
I took a left turn in the Rostropovich.
I've ended up completely lost in the Chico Hamilton.
this is an addiction.
I just can't decide between...
please pour some cold water on me, will you?
why did you want both of us here?
both... you're right. Thank you. Great idea.
anyway, funny story... stop me if you've heard it.
persian man walks into a bar, meets a beautiful woman, has a few drinks.
next thing you know, he's falling from a 12-story balcony.
I don't get it.
I imagine Agent Navabi does.
you're referring to Kian Nouri, the Iranian businessman who committed suicide in Dubai.
I am, except he wasn't a mere businessman.
he was one of Iran's top nuclear scientists in Dubai to supervise purchase of several borehole gamma something-or-others.
and he didn't commit suicide.
he was assassinated in a joint C. I.A.Mossad venture to undermine Iran's nuclear program, but, then, you know this already.
my understanding is, she took a little detour to Dubai for a rendezvous with Mr. Nouri so she could toss him off a building.
you killed him?
if you're asking me to comment on a Mossad operation, you know I can't do that.
I wasn't asking.
but I'm hardly one to judge.
george Orwell wrote,"Those who abjure violence can do so "only because others are committing violence on their behalf.
what a visionary, but, Good Lord, his books are a downer.
in any case, the bad news is,
I was sharing a bowl of shisha with a Misiri minister, and they plan to retaliate.
you kill their top scientist, they intend to kill yours, and they've dispatched a man known as "The Scimitar" to do it.
the Scimitar?
this is not your average killer, Agent Keen.
he's one part hit man, two parts con man.
I'm familiar with his work.
in 2009, his target was a Sunni tribal leader named Majeed Abd Bawi.
the Scimitar gained access by joining his militia.
Oh, that's right!
fought for the man for seven months until the day he got close enough to aerate Bawi's carotid with a fork.
he's dedicated, resilient, cunning, responsible for the murder of dozens of high-value targets, and, according to my sources, he's already on U. S. soil.
Harold, I'm the Assistant Secretary of NCB.
I run point on all international nuclear matters.
if this guy was the threat you claim, he'd be on my radar.
who's your source on this threat?
a confidential informant with an extremely reliable track record.
I'm afraid that's as specific as I can get.
if I'm right, what's our exposure on this?
cloud top.
it's the classified designation for a warhead project design.
it's staffed by our top three scientists.
if any of them fell into the hands of a rogue nation, that country's nuclear program would advance decades overnight.
what kind of security protocols do you have in place?
the DSS provides them with false identities, social security numbers, even cover professions.
we hide them in plain sight, sort of a Witness Protection for high-value assets.
that's not gonna cut it.
you need to pull these people off the streets and into protective custody.
all right, Harold. I'll put two of them on lock-down.
I can do that without drawing too much scrutiny.
and the third?
that's gonna be a problem.
the D. o.D. asset is Amalia Collins...
senior Engineer of our Warhead Design Team.
when she's not on active status, she serves as a professor of astrophysics at Duke.
it says here she's scheduled to deliver a talk tonight at a symposium at the Granville Hotel.
D. o.D.'s reluctant to call it off at the last minute because of the scrutiny it would draw.
they feel it could put her in further danger.
you mean they're not gonna pull her?
there's no indications the Iranians have any idea of her real value.
let's make sure it stays that way.
in the meantime, we need to track this Scimitar before he's able to I. D. our team.
uh, we need to talk.
I got things under control.
Uh-huh. When's the last time you used?
Sitka, almost a week.
this happens all the time... agents taking meds to get over injuries and then they get hooked. It's no big deal.
what are you gonna do, Keen? Tell Cooper I'm an addict?
I want you to get help.
and I'm telling you, I can kick this on my own, and if I can't, hell, I'll walk into Cooper's office myself.
I got no problems with that.
the camera's online.
we got what we needed.
you're looking at Agent...
...Jonathan Reese...
... of the Defense Security Service.
I got your text. What's the problem?
zebra mussels. Fish and game are running random inspections for invasive species.
zebra mussels. Did they go inside?
they tried to, but I held them off, but I don't know for how long.
we're gonna either have to move the boat or him.
talk to Volkov?
we have a meeting this afternoon.
I brought you some warmer clothes.
well, that's nice.
now you care about me.
is that it... now you're, uh, concerned... for my well-being?
you can try and make yourself feel better about what you're doing, but I told you... the truth.
I delivered on my word.
so, when are you gonna deliver on yours?
we've been over this.
you help me eliminate Berlin, and as far as I'm concerned, this whole thing is over.
until then, enjoy the view.
Liz... you can't keep me in here!
Liz! You can't keep me in here!
damn it, Liz!
Sevan Volkov! Thank you for meeting with me.
and what choice did I have?
Berlin.
I know you supply him with arms shipments.
and how do you know this? - Tell me where to find him.
if you know anything about Berlin, you know I can't do that.
thought you might say that, which is why I nominated you for our "Most Wanted" list.
C. I.D. has approved it. We're just waiting for the Director's signature.
eh, if you're gonna arrest me, arrest me.
so you can sit silent in a cell with an expensive attorney?
mm, I'd rather leave you out there, let the world know we're looking for you.
once news of this hits the streets, Berlin will know the U. S. government is spending limitless resources and time looking for you...
a man who has intimate details about him and his business affairs.
you have two options...
either you lead me to Berlin...
or I lead Berlin to you.
how exactly did you come upon this information?
a C. I.someone the Bureau trusts.
I don't believe you.
if the Bureau had a lead, they'd follow it.
you came to this on your own, and you're hiding it from them, coming to me instead.
you'd rather see Berlin dead than arrested.
berlin killed Meera. He nearly killed Cooper.
he put Tom into my life.
so if you're asking if I'm okay with a lethal outcome, damn right I am.
Yeah.
if you hadn't told me you'd killed Tom, I might think he was your source.
but I did kill him.
of course you did.
let me know when Volkov gets a time and location on Berlin.
I'll be there with bells on.
what's going on?
D. o.D. discovered a hidden surveillance camera at their Annapolis field office during a routine sweep.
how is that relevant to us?
technology was Iranian.
what were they recording?
okay, uh, the camera was placed outside the building with eyes to the front entrance.
it was relaying a live stream to some off-site location.
if I reactivate it, I should be able to triangulate the location where the feed's being transmitted.
Oh, man. I almost forgot.
in case someone's watching on the other end.
camera is live.
okay, RDF is up.
signal strength looks good.
Oh, accounting for time lag.
scanning
and... we have a lock.
it's a property just outside New Carrollton, and it looks like it's a construction site.
FBI!
clear! - Clear!
trailer's secure.
lock it down. I want eyes on all access points.
so, where the hell is everyone?
no idea.
but... could this be the man they were surveilling?
agent Jonathan Everett Reese, Defense Security Services.
they've got everything on this guy...
addresses, phone numbers, employment history.
dss is the division tasked with protecting our nuclear scientists.
they're logging his movements.
probably trying to find the most vulnerable point of attack.
it's the DSS shuttle stop.
he takes the train back from Annapolis every afternoon.
he'll be at the park-n-ride off Route 50.
we got to get there before they do.
jonathan Reese... FBI!
what's this about?- We need to move quickly. I'll explain in the car.
shooter's on the ridge! I don't have eyes!
I got threat assessments this morning of a possible Iranian Misiri action.
they want the names and locations of cloud top personnel.
you need to notify your people, activate all security protocols.
sir, I think we have a problem.
I can't reach Agents Keen or Ressler.
send a team to their last location. Find out what the hell is going on.
take it easy, Agent Keen.
you're at Bethesda.
I'm Dr. Rivera.
you and your partner were in an accident.
is he okay?
agent Ressler suffered significant head trauma in the crash.
he's had a C. T. scan. Radiology will take him for an M. R.I. shortly.
my arm?
fractured in three places.
we set it for now, but to be honest, you may need surgery to restore full mobility.
John Reese. The man who was in the car with us.
I'm sorry? Nobody else was transported from the scene.
no, no, no, no, but he was in the car.
I'm the attending on duty. No one else was brought in.
I need a phone.
listen... - Easy.
...that crash was no accident.
understood.
I'll have one brought in right away. - Okay.
we're seeing multiple 911 calls within the last hour.
they all report a black S. U.V. overturned just under a mile from where they picked up Reese.
cross-reference with local police activity.
two passengers were pulled from the wreck and evac'd by ambulance to Bethesda National.
only two? - A man and a woman.
we have to assume that's Agent Keen and either Ressler or the D. o.D. employee.
meaning what... one of them didn't survive the crash?
agent Navabi, I want you there as soon as possible.
I'll update Mullen at D. o.D.
here you go. - Thank you.
assistant Director Cooper. - It's me.
agent Keen.
you have no idea how good it is to hear your voice.
are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, but, uh... Ressler... he's hurt.
the Iranians have John Reese.
I heard some men's voices before I passed out. They were speaking Farsi.
someone needs to find Professor Collins.
the D. o.D. needs to cancel that speech and put her in protective custody now.
I've already alerted the D. o.D.
I'm heading to the event site myself to make sure she's on lockdown.
agent Keen, the neurology team at Bethesda's one of the best.
they'll take good care of Ressler.
agent Navabi's on her way to you.
get some rest.
thanks for coming. - I got your message.
John Reese was abducted by the Iranians a little over an hour ago.
we need to pull Professor Collins, and I need anything you can give me on Reese - so we can get to him... - Harold, I checked.
not in DSS, not in any sector.
our people spoke to Reese directly.
the Iranians have his profile, his DSS security badge.
thought it might be an alias, but it's not. He doesn't exist.
uh, sir? Just got off the phone with Bethesda National.
uh, the hospital has no record of Agents Keen or Ressler being brought in.
I just spoke to her.
how's everything in here?
okay.
you're doing okay, hon?
Yeah.
what happened to Radiology? They were gonna take him for another scan.
Oh, well, I'm sure someone will be down soon.
he's your partner, isn't he?
I understand.
I'll call them right now.
ma'am, A-Agent Keen, you can't be up.
no... we need to get the radiologist now! - Oh, o-okay.
okay, you're fine.
you're all right. - Oh, I'm sorry.
we need to get Radiology in... - Let's get you back in bed.
you're fine.
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry. - It's all right.
you just relax.
we need to get Radiology.
okay, take it easy. Take it easy.
thank you.
I never eat anchovies unless I don't know I'm eating them.
but I have to say, this is pretty delicious.
anchovies get a bad rap.
try the wine.
it would be better with beer.
it might very well be better with beer.
do you have kids, Kenneth?
I do... a daughter.
the two of you close?
it's complicated.
she doesn't like anchovies?
you know, I don't know about that.
I wish it were that simple.
my father... he and I...
my father did things I hated him for.
things that were... unforgivable.
have you told him?
I haven't seen my father...
in a long... long time.
what have you done?
it's okay. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
we got played. The Scimitar created John Reese.
which means we didn't find that construction trailer. We were led there.
everything in that trailer was designed to make us think John Reese was DSS.
Why? - So when we lost him, we would think the identity of our scientist was in jeopardy.
this was all done to trigger a reaction.
they isolated Keen and Ressler, made them believe that losing Reese was a threat to national security.
so, where the heck is Agents Keen and Ressler?
someone needs to find Professor Collins.
the D. o.D. needs to cancel that speech and put her in protective custody now.
we ran the name as soon as we heard it.
there's an astrophysics professor named Amalia Collins.
I'm looking forward to meeting Professor Collins.
you need to move quickly, sir.
I'm leaving now.
make sure to clean things up here.
and the Agents?
we're finished with them.
good news.
radiology called. They'll be down for your partner in the next 20 minutes.
Oh, that's great. Thank you.
what's that? - It's just a little something so that arm of yours doesn't get infected.
you tell me what's in the syringe...
...or I will stick it in you and find out for myself.
it's a sedative. Please don't.
what's in his I. V? - Same thing.
okay, who are you? Where is this hospital?
doctor!
can you hear me? We got to get the hell out of here!
they're definitely not at Bethesda.
Cooper went to secure Professor Collins.
uh, I traced the call Liz made to Cooper's cell.
their rerouting and encryption are incredibly sophisticated.
this is gonna take hours to untangle.
okay, so, what's next?
Cooper's pulled six teams from other assignments. He sent them...
Hello?
Dembe, it's Agent Navabi. We have a situation.
come on. We got to go now.
it's been over two hours. I don't need to tell you his reputation.
once he has the intelligence he needs... - Yes, I know, Agent Navabi.
tell me about this lead of yours.
he's not my lead. His name is Ali Hassan.
he's the target of a major Mossad initiative.
I have a slight but memorable acquaintance with Mr. Hassan.
Mossad has been tracking his movements for months.
my superiors believe he's the key to unraveling a dozen covert Iranian opts.
but you think he knows where to find The Scimitar.
perhaps.
Mossad has no tolerance for any agenda except Mossad's.
you'll be sanctioned for this indiscretion.
so be it.
I can't work with this task force unless my partners are my highest priority.
so this has become quite personal.
I understand.
but you may have an even more personal stake in this case than perhaps you realize.
and why is that?
because one of The Scimitar's little-known aliases is Walid Abu Sitta.
walid Abu Sitta is the man who ordered the bombing that killed my brother.
Yes. That's why I brought this case to you.
there.
what was that? You hear that?
farid, what's going on?!
Hassan! I love this club! - Son of a bitch!
carbon fiber? - Reddington, stop!
stop!
damn it! What have you done with my guard?!
Farid is taking a rest.
keep your plum covered. We're not alone.
I'll take your weapon.
I've always regretted sparing your life that night in the Strait of Hormuz.
but I see pity has its rewards. Live and learn.
you've been very careless, Ali.
my unit has been surveilling you for months, and the intelligence we've gathered has been very helpful...
so helpful that I fully expect to be disciplined for coming here without authorization.
just by being here, I have everything and, therefore, nothing to lose.
what do you want?
the Scimitar.
my friend here thinks you may know where to find him.
he would've needed support when he got to the States.
I'm guessing that support came from you.
I know what you must be thinking, Ali.
imagine your future, the rest of your life spent in a dismal Israeli prison, some dark hole they put you in, bending your fingers and pulling your toes until they forget you ever existed.
think carefully, Ali, because, as you are my witness, that future will seem very bright, indeed, if you don't tell us what we want to know.
he did make contact.
asked to use one of my warehouses.
said he needed building supplies.
for what, I don't know.
tell me about this warehouse.
Reddington, I have them.
director Cooper? Owen Doherty. We spoke on the phone.
where are we?- Well, we went ahead and canceled the event, initiated evac protocol.
we've placed Collins in a holding room.
does she have a security detail? - Yes, sir... two on the door.
take me to her.
who is it?
ms. Collins? FBI. I need you to open the door, please.
professor Collins.
you are going to pay the price for the crimes committed by your government.
but first... you're gonna help us create the weapon that will be used to bring this country to its knees.
you said there were two men posted outside the door.
there were.
on my ready.
clear.
not here, sir.
let's just hope she's still in the building.
nobody leaves until we find Collins.
Collins is missing. Cooper thinks she's still on site.
okay, listen up, folks!
we have a situation here! We need everyone to move inside!
now! Let's go! - Please. Move into the lobby!
Sir?! Sir?
sir, don't move!
hands where I can see them!
slowly!
Hello, Agent Keen.
I see you've made a spectacular recovery.
we've suffered a setback.
no, no, no, no, no. I'll need the full package...
new credentials, a safe house, and 50, 000...
no.
I'll need it within the hour.
all this running around. Really?
I'm so relieved when the people I'm chasing... come to me.
agent Navabi, you got my message.
we were just admiring the view.
how did you know?
Mr. Hassan provided for our friend before, and most criminals return to the same trough time and time again.
indolence, I suppose.
personally, I make it a habit to avoid habits.
I can call it in.
Yes, I suppose you can.
the question is, do you want to?
I offer him to you as a gift.
what am I supposed to do with him?
whatever you like.
nobody else knows he's here.
agent Keen just called.
her source provided Berlin's location.
forgive me. I have an appointment that can't be rescheduled.
don't do anything I wouldn't do.
he was my brother.
one of the many nameless, faceless men you killed in Pishin.
Pishin was the work of a suicide bomber.
acting under your direction.
you're wrong.
I know the name Shahin Navabi.
I saw him...
spoke to him the day he died.
you're lying.
if you think your beloved brother was just another faceless young man in that crowd...
you know nothing.
I will kill you.
like Kian Nouri?
the scientist you murdered last week in Dubai?
what do you know about my brother?
there's no country insisting you do your duty.
if you kill me, it'll be cold-blooded murder.
so, call the Mossad or the C. I.A.
or whoever's coming and be done with it.
I thought for a second we might lose you back there.
prospect of having to live without me...
must've been terrifying.
it was.
the irony is...
...with all the drugs they pumped in me, this is the best I've felt all week.
what about that? Is that gonna be a problem?
I just got a call from MPD Harbor Patrol.
they fished a man's body out of the Anacostia.
matches your description of The Scimitar.
get there. - Yes, sir.
hmm?
I'll catch up.
that's him.
shot point-blank to the head. This was an execution.
who would have done this?
talk to Volkov?
he gave us a location on Berlin.
we'll see how that pans out.
the information I gave you ...is good.
volkov will lead to Berlin.
Reddington will kill Berlin.
and my value to you... will end.
and then what?
you gonna turn me in, Liz?
lose your job, go to jail?
the only way to get me out of your life, Liz.
is to let me go because if you kill me...
if you go through with it, then we'll be linked forever.
even if you get away with it, even if nobody ever finds out...
...you're always gonna have to live with it.
Yeah, well...
...when I make my decision, you'll be the first to know.
Oh, I knew the second you brought me down here that you had no intention... of letting me live.
so, here's the deal... Liz.
you're gonna do whatever the hell you're gonna do.
you always have.
just do me a favor.
look me in the eyes when you do it.
I know you were expecting Volkov, but as luck would have it, he sold you out to Agent Keen.
it's surprising she came to me instead of the Bureau with the hope that I would kill you.
I have other plans.
first, understand I didn't have to come here alone.
in fact, I didn't have to come here at all.
I could've sent seven men and put an end to this war.
why didn't you? - Because this entire affair, every ounce of pain and suffering that all of us have endured has been the result of a tragic and, frankly, mysterious misunderstanding... one I intend to correct.
there's not much left I truly cherish in this world, but I swear on those few things I still hold dear,
I did not kill your daughter.
words, words.
the greater the words, the larger the lie.
my daughter is dead.
but yours...
my men tell me you've been spending a lot of time together.
maybe, when I've done to your daughter what you did to mine, we can finally be even.
I'm sorry.
is this the daughter you're referring to?
because she's not my daughter.
she's yours.
4 months ago - No. - We can't leave him alive.
please go. I'll finish it.
this is between us.
do it quickly. I'll be waiting outside.
Hey! What happened to you?
I went out front, and you were gone.
there were police.
is it done? - Yes. He's dead.
call Ellie.
Hello? - Hey, it's me.
it's about tom. It's urgent.
I could lose my license for this, go to jail.
you owe me.
why aren't we at a hospital? He could die!
he cannot die.
I'm gonna need supplies, proper tools.
Steven, hey. It's me. Uh, listen, uh... your boat.
is it still sitting empty or did you find a buyer?
he's lost too much blood.
you're a fed.
and he is responsible for Meera's death.
you were her C. I.and you told me that if I found the man responsible...
I thought you were gonna arrest him. - I will.
I just need you to babysit for a little while until I get some info.
day #2
I saved you because you have intel on Berlin.
I want a name.
Oh, you bitch.
Oh, I don't know, tom.
from where I'm sitting, you look like the bitch to me.
day #4
why you? Have you spied on others? Is this what you do?
Yes. No. I don't remember.
I want a name. What bank?
monarch Douglas in Warsaw. It's where Berlin keeps his money.
what about accounts, names of shell companies?
day #11
did you murder Jolene Parker?
what do you know about Reddington? - I don't know.
what do you know about Reddington? - I told you I don't know!
what do you know about Reddington?! - Stop asking me! I don't know!
day #22
when is this all over, when you are convinced that I have nothing left to offer, what then?
I asked you a question. Gina Zanetakos.
because you know when this is over, you're gonna have to kill me, right?
how often did you communicate with Berlin, his associates?
tell me about the guests at our wedding.
if you want Ellie to look at that infection, you're gonna have to answer my question.
I need a doctor! - I need a name!
day #77
what about the adoption?
we were married. Isn't that what married people do?
you know, all this time, you never asked me if I ever really loved you.
because I know the answer.
I don't think you do.
you told me if I gave you Berlin that you would let me go.
but I knew the second that you brought me down here that you had no intention of letting me leave.
so here's the deal, Liz.
you're gonna do whatever you're gonna do. You always have.
just do me one favor.
look me in the eyes when you do it.
your daughter told me your name is Milos Kirchhoff.
all these years, Mr. Kirchhoff, you've believed with the blackest of hearts that I murdered your daughter. And yet here she is.
the story was wrong, Milos.
please enlighten me.
what were you told and who did the telling?
it was in '91.
the Soviet union was falling apart.
a small group of us... Members of the Politburo, the military,
KGB, Stasi...
had a plan to push back the progressives, to stem the tide.
we were meeting and discussing strategy when a... Bomb...
the Kursk bombing.
15 men were killed and with them, our resistance.
rumors began that the Americans were involved.
one name emerged.
yours.
you came after my daughter.
you exposed her as a dissident.
she went to jail.
after that, my loyalty was questioned.
I was exiled to the Gulag, where, one by one, her bones were sent to me.
you fled.
you must have had help. Who?
there was a man.
he said he could protect me from... From you.
what was his name?
I never met him. I don't know.
his people... They called him "The Decembrist.
please. That's all I know.
you killed my friends.
you destroyed my life once. Isn't that enough?
at some point, I may call, ask for your assistance.
about what?
the Decembrist.
we can't let him walk out of here.
we agreed when this was over, I'd arrest him.
that was four months ago.
if you turn him in now, you're gonna go to jail. We both will.
I am not a murderer. - Neither am I.
look, you don't have to be the one to do it. There are people.
but he can't walk out of here alive.
close that door. Keep him quiet.
Whoa! Easy! Harbor master. - All right.
I'm gonna need to see some kind of I. D. - Put the gun down!
we... got a call...
reports that someone's been trespassing.
Yeah. That's why I'm here.
FBI. We're searching for two fugitives escaped from cumberland last night.
I cleared the boat, but they're said to be in the area and armed.
my office wasn't contacted.
bureau would have reached out, but Homeland's running point.
go figure. If you do see anything...
be careful. - Yeah, you, too.
Dembe. Where is he?
you're working with Berlin?
I need to talk to you about a bombing in the Soviet union...
kursk, 1991.
fella won't talk! - Keep pushing him.
I'm telling you! He's more scared of talking than he is of dying!
keep pushing.
I'm gonna need lunch!
tuna on Rye! Coleslaw if they have it!
what the hell is going on?!
we're shaking a few trees.
there's been a development.
it seems Berlin is merely a pawn who's been tragically manipulated.
manipulated by who?
that's what Brimley's trying to ascertain.
berlin killed Meera, he put tom in my life, and every time you have a chance to stop him, you let him go.
berlin will be held accountable for his actions after I acquire the name of the man who set him against me, a man they call The Decembrist.
if you want to find the one ultimately responsible for gutting Harold Cooper and killing Meera Malik,
I suggest you help me find him.
the man we're looking for is known as The Decembrist.
his acts are said to have contributed to the end of communism in eastern Europe.
how is he connected to Berlin?
he tried to assassinate him during a meeting in Kursk and faked his daughter's death.
berlin's been hunting Reddington, hunting us, and now Reddington wants to help Berlin get revenge?
Kursk... that bombing...
the men who were killed that day were leaders of the Soviet old guard.
you really think we should be helping these two settle scores?
our goal is to take down Berlin.
if that means solving a terrorism case along the way, I'm fine with that.
I'll contact the FSB. - They won't help.
the bombing was considered an act of patriotism.
that's why they never pursued it.
pull the Russian reports, the crime-lab data.
I want our own analysis.
they have the bomber's DNA?
Yes. The Russian crime lab reported finding epithelial cells on the lip of a coffee tin found in the debris.
how do you know it was the bomber's DNA? Didn't anyone else like coffee?
uh, the reports I. D.'D the explosive device as Semtex...
same explosives a bomber used to down pan am 103 by hiding the explosives...
in a coffee tin. Our guy copied that?
they have a name?
only a DNA profile, which was useless 20 years ago before they had a database to run it against.
but today... - You found The Decembrist.
Kiryl Morozov. 20 years ago, he was a low-level KGB operative.
and today?
one of the most powerful men in Russia.
someone there?
okay.
Oh, thank God.
please.
Kiryl Morozov is one of Putin's most trusted advisers.
the man runs the finance ministry.
and we have reason to believe he's responsible for the 1991 bombing in Kursk that left...
12 people dead. In Russia.
the FBI investigates crimes that happen in America or against Americans.
Reddington won't give us Berlin until we give him Morozov.
at the very least, we should go there and question the man.
I'm not sending you to Moscow to interrogate a high-ranking Russian official about an act of terror he may or may not have committed 25 years ago.
if Reddington gets to Morozov first, God knows...
Harold, that's an order.
that's it? You're just gonna stand down on this?
you heard her. My hands are tied.
but Reddington has anonymous sources. I'm sure he'll get that name somehow.
won't he, agent Keen?
Yes, sir. I'm sure he will.
tell me you have a name.
I do, but this can't come back on the task force. Are we clear?
hold on. I'll be right back.
what? Everything okay?
no, everything's not okay. We got a situation here.
uh, hey. I'm sorry. I got to go.
Lizzy, what's going on?
the Decembrist... His real name is Kiryl Morozov.
something's wrong.
I got a name.
so it's done?
no.
what are you proposing?
a trip to Moscow.
I went out for a smoke, and he was here. - What the hell?!
homeboy had a gun.
are you out of your mind?! - It was him or me.
he's got blood on him. What did you do? How are we supposed to...
if he doesn't answer that, someone is gonna come looking for him.
okay. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna let him go.
we're gonna move Tom. - Let him go? He's gonna talk.
so let him talk. He says anything, it's his word against mine.
and he's an informant.
look, lady. This is obviously official business.
I can look the other way. - You got to kill him.
No! Please! Listen. Listen...
look, if you let this guy go, he's going to the cops.
when he does, we are all going to jail, starting with you, for torture, kidnapping, wrongful imprisonment...
take your pick, sweetheart.
you got to kill him.
no. I can fix this.
I have a storage unit. We'll wait till it gets dark.
we'll keep him here temporarily until we can find ano...
No! - It's better this way.
let him do it. - Get off me! Get your hands off me!
Tom, no!
Tom, stop!
next one goes in your chest!
Tom, let him go!
I think maybe you should call Mr. Kaplan.
mercury City Tower.
Kiryl Morozov is paranoid and well-protected.
he has no clear weakness for women or drink.
however, like any politician, he does have an unending need to hide his ill-gotten gains.
the diamonds.
which he buys and sells through your broker at Mercury City Tower in Moscow.
there was a friendly and rather convenient diamond heist this morning.
when Morozov learns the broker has been hit, he'll insist on a meeting to assess his exposure.
when he does, we'll be there waiting.
Milos, focus.
I've made Morozov millions, and he's the one who set all this in motion?
Milos, the meeting at Mercury tower...
when it happens, it'll happen fast before the M. U.R. Arrives.
my people will be ready.
who are you?
what do you want?
I am retribution.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Kursk.
milos? - The bombing, my daughter...
all of it brings us here.
I did what I was told.
you're not The Decembrist.
it was the American. It was him.
they gave the order!
what people?
I can't say.
who is The Decembrist?
his name is Alan Fitch.
Milos, this you cannot do.
give me one reason. - Because he's mine.
yours? He gave the orders, discredited you, and you want to protect him?
this is not for you to do.
but I will.
alan Fitch is dead.
call The Florist.
the joint chiefs want another forward base.
that will only happen if we can convince Islamabad, which is unlikely.
it will happen if we tether it to foreign military investment.
sir, will you make the call?
a little early in the day, don't you think, Ray?
I'm still on Moscow time.
just got back from calling on an old friend of yours...
you met with the Russian finance minister? To what end?
to his end, as it turned out.
drink?
the finance minister of Russia is dead.
if a single word... A whisper of this gets out, - if anyone even suspects we sanctioned it... - I didn't sanction anything.
damn it, Harold. Your team discovers Morozov was behind the Kursk bombing, and 18 hours later, he's dead?
Reddington is behind this!
Reddington called an hour ago.
he believes Alan Fitch's life is in danger.
did Reddington bother to tell you why
berlin is suddenly interested in killing Alan Fitch?
he believes he's the one who orchestrated the Kursk bombing.
are you accusing the assistant director of national intelligence of being a terrorist?
we need to bring him in. - Alan Fitch is not your concern.
I'll contact the secretary of Homeland Security and have the situation handled.
ray, will you listen?
we had an agreement. - Yes.
I don't go after you, you don't come after me.
I know the terms, Ray.
but Berlin predates it.
you ordered the bombing in Kursk.
then you pinned it on me.
you blamed me for killing his daughter.
some years ago, a copy of this photo was left on the corpse of an associate of mine.
taking it as a warning,
I traced the girl to a man they call The Stewmaker.
he told me a story about the girl.
she was sent to him by a man she'd never met.
she was in trouble, needed to disappear, so he took her photo, put it in a locket, and sent it to her father.
all those years spent searching for the man who supposedly murdered his daughter, and it was you.
you sat here in this very room and pretended you had no idea who Berlin was or why he was coming for me.
he was coming, Alan, because you sent him.
I sent a lot of guys.
you and I were not on the best of terms at the time.
and since you're playing the innocent victim in all this, let me remind you...
you stole some very damaging information about us when you disappeared.
you violated our agreement.
no. I honored it.
I got the others to hold off, but Milos Kirchhoff, Berlin, whatever the hell name he's using...
he chewed through the leash.
I couldn't stop him.
well, now your dog is tracking a new scent... Yours.
and there's nothing I can do about that, Alan.
I have my people looking for him, but Berlin has gone into the wind.
and he's coming for you.
you have no allies in my group.
without me to protect you, they'll take you down and they'll let the chips fall where they may.
so this is as much your problem as it is mine.
sir, ODNI has credible intel that there might be an attempt on your life.
what did they say? - Still waiting to hear.
they want to move you to fort McNair to do a full briefing.
deputy Fitch, Homeland Security.
we need you to come with us.
guardian's en route. Delivery on schedule.
our office has notified the university.
we have the package.
contact the D. C. field office.
get me an update on any eyewitnesses, satellite footage.
alan Fitch's abduction must be on Mossad's radar.
reach out to your people in Tel Aviv.
and you... talk to him.
Elizabeth, we need to talk. Now.
what?
you told me tom is dead. He's not.
who told you he's alive?
I'm disappointed you haven't felt that you could trust me enough to tell me this.
look, okay, I lied.
but I only kept it a secret because I know you want him dead.
no, you kept it a secret because you didn't want to admit to yourself that you still love him, that even after everything he has done, after how horribly he treated you, you still can't let him go.
so... you're playing house.
I've been using him as a source, and he's been incredibly valuable.
normally, any intelligence you could gather from tom keen would be yesterday's news, but Berlin has gone to ground and is likely dependent on former assets he used when your husband was in his employ.
so it seems Tom may be of some value after all.
I need to know everything he can tell you about Berlin's former safe houses, former contacts.
all that matters is finding Alan Fitch.
this ends now.
I already gave you Berlin. I told you where to find him.
Yes. And he disappeared.
I did everything I could... from in here.
forget it. I already told you... - And I told you it's the only way.
take a look, Liz. This is a problem.
and time is not on your side.
I need information, not advice.
we both know that you are in over your head.
you are not equipped for this, Liz, because you are not a killer.
it's why I'm still alive and why you've got a corpse lying there that you have done nothing with.
and your bodyguard, the one that you shot...
where do you think he is right now?
he's getting a gun, Liz, so he can come back here and kill me and then probably kill you, too.
now, I told you... there is a way out of this.
I can give you Berlin, and all you have to do...
is let me go.
gosh, he's a popular guy.
I bet somebody's gonna miss him.
Berlin.
orenburg six.
Scorpio.
that function is no longer valid.
wait, wait, listen.
tell him Tom Keen wants to talk.
Liz, why would you do this?
I mean, you're risking everything.
to find Berlin.
you're a federal agent harboring a fugitive.
I mean, worse than that... You're keeping him captive.
500 cops are out there looking for Fitch right now, and we're gonna find him because of this.
I thought you were dead.
I need you to bring me in. - No.
listen to me. I can help you.
well, time has passed. Plans have changed.
I know you have Fitch.
I know everything they know about you and your operation, and you're gonna want to hear it, but I'm not telling you anything until you bring me in.
whether he leads us to Fitch or not, I got to take him in.
are you hearing me?
you had to know when you told me that this is where it was gonna go.
Liz, I can't be part of this.
he's an informant, like Reddington.
the difference is you're not in love with Reddington.
I got an address. - Where?
where? What difference does it make where?
what? You're gonna follow his lead to someplace he says Berlin is hiding?
no. There could be 50 guys waiting.
that's stupid.
Hey, shut up. I wasn't asking you.
you want Berlin or not?
there's no way I'm gonna let you go in there.
this is a setup, an ambush.
what are you, her boyfriend?
Hey!
what address?
3952 Spalding street, apartment 24.
Hey, pal. I'm coming for you.
good luck with that.
I think we have a problem.
clear it out. Let's go. Clear out. Clear out.
looks like we're dealing with a plastic explosive... C4, approximately 2 kilos.
sir, the blasting cap's wired to a receiver. We found our detonator.
this thing can be detonated remotely.
we need to jam the frequencies in case this nut job tries to set it off and blow us to hell.
then you're gonna disarm it?
we have a vehicle for controlled detonation.
it should be big enough to accommodate Mr. Fitch and one of my men.
once he's contained, then we can attempt to disassemble and disarm the device.
well, how long is that thing gonna take to get here?
half-hour minimum, unless you've got another R. F. Resistant armored box that fits two.
actually, I think it fits four.
we managed to gain access to the internals, trying to circumvent the keypad.
here's what we got so far.
the Semtex runs along the circumference of the collar, as you can see.
encased within that, approximately 14 inches of solid core wire connected to a microprocessor which, among other things, creates a closed circuit.
so if you cut the collar off, you interrupt the circuit and... bang?
then how do we disable it?
cautiously.
we need to chip through the semtex to see exactly what's underneath, make sure there aren't any redundant circuits or backups.
and you can do that without triggering that thing?
we'll find out, won't we?
look, I know I disobeyed a direct...
you found him. That's all that matters.
fill me in.
well played, Keen. I mean, look at it.
berlin's gone. Tom's free. - He brought us Fitch.
berlin handed us Fitch on a silver platter after he had a bomb strapped to his neck.
look, I've been thinking about what I said in the car, and...
don't worry about it, Ressler. I'll tell Cooper.
I understand you're responsible for finding Fitch.
about the source... - Yes.
does he have information about Berlin?
Yes, we believe he does.
I don't care if your source is confidential or what promises you've made him.
I want him here, I want him interrogated, and I want his name.
you must be kidding.
do I sound like I'm kidding?
it's Reddington.
her source is Reddington.
please excuse my intrusion.
I'm curious.
your father... I assume he's been trying to reach you. Has he called?
I thought as much.
sir, the device has a secondary detonator built in as a safeguard.
what kind of safeguard? - A timer.
we think it was activated when the receiver broke radio contact.
how long do you have? - It's unclear.
we can see the timing circuit, but there's no display.
it could be a minute. It could be an hour.
you're not hungry? - It's fine.
let's get you something else.
huh? Whatever you like.
I can tell them to go.
no. I'm the one who should go. I...
no, no. They make you uncomfortable, eh?
I'm glad you called.
you're scared.
I am, too.
I don't know how to talk to someone...
like you.
I really should go. - No. Please don't.
I know you have your life.
I have no place there. I know.
but I just want you to stay a little longer.
Hello, Milos.
thank you, my dear.
passports, tickets, and my eternal gratitude.
the bomb. I need to know how to stop the bomb.
I don't know.
that's the wrong answer.
I'm telling you... I don't...
think harder.
what's your name, son?
what?
your name. What... what is it?
sir, I need to be as still as possible.
any movement, the vibrations of your voice...
do you have a wife, kids?
that's what makes it the hardest... A wife and kids.
I've been in the intelligence field a long time now.
on my orders, 763 men and women have died in service to their country.
and there wasn't a grieving wife or mother or husband
I didn't either call or visit personally.
thank them for their sacrifice.
that's what makes it the hardest... The families.
you can't disarm it, can you?
sir, I asked you to be as still as possible.
763
that's more than enough.
I'm not gonna make it 764.
what's your name?
Mike. My name's Mike.
go home, Mike.
you've done everything you can.
Harold, I know you're listening.
tell Ray I need to see him.
no signal
what a long, strange trip it's been, Alan.
listen to me, Ray.
I don't know how much time we have, so you need to pay attention.
I've been able to hold everyone off, convince them that it's in their best interests to let you live.
but people aren't as scared as they once were.
some aren't so sure you even have it.
do you have it, Ray?
do you have the Fulcrum?
they're gonna demand proof.
I can't stop this thing, Alan.
I tried.
I can't.
my death will trigger a series of events.
the moderates are already outnumbered.
the closer we get to 2017, the more radicalized they'll become.
talk to Mitchum and Hobbs.
they might be persuaded.
Jasper sides with the Chinese...
all right. Listen to me, Ray. This is critical.
I have a safe. Get to it.
the combination...
remember that. Say it back.
Margaret's birthday.
you've had a wonderful life together, Alan.
51 years last month.
the safe.
the safe.
it's in St. Petersburg in the wall on the second floor of...
untie him.
thank you.
na zdorov'e.
I remember the parades from when I was a young boy, standing by my father, seeing those trucks coming by with the rockets and cannons. Beautiful.
and all those men marching as one, saluting at me as one.
our soldiers, our nation.
Yuri Gargarin was the first man in space.
we were so proud.
your gentleman friend with the earring said he moved the body.
Mr. Kaplan is with him now. We're trying to contain the situation.
you should have come to me.
I didn't need to.
look around you, lizzy.
we found Fitch because of Tom. - It wasn't worth it...
not if the cost was you, here in this...
filth.
I couldn't do it.
I told you I could kill Tom, but...
after you left, I just...
after all the lies and everything he did to me,
I told myself I was using him, that I was finally in control.
when you love someone, you have no control.
that's what love is...
being powerless.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
there's nothing wrong with you.
there's nothing wrong with you.
do you have it?
you are never to see her again.
Yeah. I got it.
I don't think you do.
look at me.
you are never to see her again.
you know, for what it's worth, I spent four months on that ship chained up...
and I never told her about us.
not one word.
Pesaro Castle
the apothecary prepared this liniment, my lord.
he mentioned it might hurt, but said the pain was worth enduring.
count again? - Yes, my lord.
otherwise the wound might fester.
and we are done, my good Lord Sforza.
damn horse. A viper must have startled him.
but we must count our blessings, my lord.
you may be some months in this little room.
at least your leg has been saved.
you have been kind to me, Lucrezia Borgia.
and it may be that...
I was not, in the first instance... kind to you.
please my lord, do not think.
I see now that nobility springs from the soul not from the blood.
I forgive you the accident of your family name.
I must accept your forgiveness, then, my lord, for the accident of my Borgia blood.
and I would, as a mark of thanks for your care, these past few days, lend you my horse.
your horse?
he is the very devil when he's not being ridden.
I will gladly ride him out, my lord.
king Ferrante of Naples sends his humble regards.
king Ferrante of Naples can neither hear nor see, - I believe? - Son.
he nevertheless sends his every good wish.
and in the face of all of the spurious claims upon his kingdom from Spain, from France from the Duchy of Milan, he would remind Your Holiness of the justice of the independent claims of Naples.
an independent Naples can only be to Rome's benefit.
and I, as his ambassador, am proud to present the suit, for your consideration, of his last unmarried daughter, Sancia, Duchessa of Squillace.
where is Squillace?
in the Kingdom of Naples.
my younger brother Joffre is all of 13 years old.
his Highness had understood the prospective groom to be the Gonfaloniere himself, the Duke of Gandia.
me? Well, this is most irregular.
I would never consider marrying the illegitimate daughter of the King of Naples.
would you convey our thanks to our friend and ally, King Ferrante, whose claim itondependence we fully understand, for his most generous offer?
you will have our response shortly.
my husband cannot ride.
he cannot rut.
he cannot even hunt. Even the deer are happy.
will I be punished for that? Will I be whipped?
for making the deer happy?
are you happy, my lady?
perhaps.
give the horse his heed. - But no whip?
no need for whip. Kick your heels.
you thought it appropriate?
I, Juan Borgia, and the illegitimate daughter of the King of Naples?
the Duchessa of Squillace?
our alliance with Naples is now of the utmost importance.
I am the Duke of Gandia.
the Gonfaloniere of the papal state.
the son of the Pope of Rome.
Oh, Brother, we both are that. - Oh, you marry her then.
you know marriage for me is not an option.
well, then, let it be Joffre!
Joffre still plays with his sister's dolls.
here we have a life-size one.
Lucrezia still plays with dolls. She got married.
she did.
are we to send all of our loved ones off to Pesaro? To Squillace?
I will not marry the Duchessa of Squillace.
but I will ride to Naples to present my young brother's suit.
Juan...
one of us must ensure that she is a suitable bride.
or would you prefer the honour?
I cannot. I am occupied in Rome.
Yes, so I 've heard.
what have you heard?
that beneath that cardinal's skirt, there may still be a man.
look at you. - Me?
like Narcissus. In the spring waters.
Narcissus?
you don't know Narcissus?
I can neither read nor write, my Lady Lucrezia.
narcissus fell in love with his own reflection.
in the waters of a spring.
do not move.
it is impossible.
to fall in love with a reflection?
to kiss it.
and I thought I would never know sweetness.
it's your residence, Cardinal? - For the moment.
you are spare in your tastes, Cardinal.
there is but one ornament I need here.
may I call you something other than Cardinal?
call me Cesare.
Cesare.
remind me why I'm here, Cesare.
because you want to be.
because...
your husband's absence makes it possible.
because...
it is time to stop pretending.
please. I do not trust my heart.
Oh, you must, to have come here with me.
can you love me, Cesare Borgia?
or is it just desires of the flesh?
I am very much afraid that it is both.
one or the other, I could deal with.
both, and I may be lost.
can a good thing come from a bad thing, Paolo the groom?
is this a good thing?
Yes. I think.
and what is the bad?
I think you know... Paolo the groom.
I have a second name.
and I don't want to know it.
I would call you Narcissus.
Oh, my God.
you make me hope.
and I'm afraid of hope.
hope for what?
for days like this.
in the future, with you.
if you were given them?
I beg you, do not make me hope.
he will be home in two days.
perhaps his business will detain him.
now, I desire a purely defensive union.
the terms of which have already been outlined by our respective ambassadors.
and I desire the happiness of our youngest son.
and 200, 000 ducats, surely. - Perhaps.
but we need this union more than we need riches.
the wolves are bearing down on the Papal States.
and... we would have a wedding if only to once again see our dear Lucrezia.
Naples
forgive me, Gonfaloniere Borgia, if I feed my father as we converse.
he has so few pleasures left.
but he does like his chicken!
what a coincidence.
chicken is my brother Joffre's favourite.
perhaps my sister can feed him thus.
he is all of 13 years old. Soon to be a man.
I am truly blessed then, in this union. - You are.
and your brother, Gonfaloniere, is he illegitimate, like me?
his father has drafted a papal bull to confer legitimacy on all his children.
and that has bearing on the matter of bastardy, does it?
we do not appreciate that term, Your Highness.
why not? I never minded it.
I found it gave one a certain licence.
let me just say that his rights of inheritance are secure, under law.
if my betrothed has anything like the vigour of his brother...
you would marry this Borgia here, would you not, dear sister?
I am your bastard sister, Alfonso.
I shall marry whomever I am told.
I am sure your brother should grow into your stature, Gonfaloniere.
it comes with many benefits: the Borgia name, the Borgia prowess.
I am told it is considerable, within and without the marital bed.
most important of all, the protection of the Pope of Rome for our poor, beleaguered kingdom of Naples.
we have enemies fast approaching, Gonfaloniere.
my father's name was once enough to terrify them.
perhaps your father's name should do the same?
I have been entruestd with all of my father's battles.
are you not scared, dear sister?
I fear... I fear, I fear.
perhaps after our meal, Gonfaloniere, my sister can give you the royal tour?
my father had a way of, uh, dealing with his enemies.
it might prove instructive for the future.
your father had them stuffed?
indeed.
clever.
his reputation then preceded him.
as does your reputation precede you.
does it? Should I be honoured?
in my father's case, it inspired terror.
what do I inspire, Juan Borgia?
lust.
then I must make do... with lust.
you would sample your brother's betrothed the way you would a mare?
but one of such beauty.
sample her, then.
I would know...
how she can be ridden.
Oh, she can. She can.
you find the art of politics more engrossing than... Than...
than the art of love?
did I say that?
they have more in common than you might think.
I would doubt that.
let us take your most elegant leg.
a perfect metaphor for Italian politics.
here we have France, the source of all disquiet.
but travelling south across the Alps, we find the dukedom of Milan. Hmm?
and below her, Florence.
and here, this little mound... is Rome.
but Naples is your elegant calf, your exquisite ankle, your heel,your sole,and your most delicious toe.
now lying here it may not seem important.
but try to stand, and you'll find that all your balance comes from here.
Naples. - Hmm. Naples.
but now, I'm going to invade fair France.
france
his Highness is testing a new cannon, Your Eminence.
perfected during a battle against those English barbarians.
fire!
your Royal Highness, may I introduce you to Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere.
cardinal Della Rovere, His Royal Highness, King Charles, of France.
your Royal Highness.
we have heard of you.
and I of you, Your Highness.
your military renown has travelled far - and wide enough of the pleasantries!
you are the one that would give us the crown of Naples?
the Kingdom of France has long had claims on the investiture of the Kingdom of Naples.
I would said, enough pleasantries, did I not?
just tell me, Cardinal, how you would place the crown of Naples on this ugly head of mine?
and it is exceedingly ugly, is it not?
your Highness bears all the vigour of the French race in his person.
he is afraid to say it!
is my head not ugly, General?
I can hardly bear to gaze at it.
so admit it, Cardinal.
I have all the graces of a carnival dwarf.
those words would never pass my lips, Your Highness.
well then, we may get nowhere. I appreciate only plain speech.
tell us then what you want of us, plainly.
my countrymen are accustomed to the show of war, not the reality.
they could never muster the courage to sustain your French fury.
you want me to march to Rome, depose that Borgia, give you the papal crown, in the hope that you'll place the crown of Naples on this ugly head?
I want to restore the Universal Church to her former dignity.
couldn't this Borgia do the same?
restore the Church?
place the Crown of Naples on this ugly noggin. - Noggin?
head.
either way, you must get to Rome, Your Highness. - Must I?
and my countrymen are accustomed to the show of war. Oh lord!
my husband has been absent all of a week now.
you said he went to Ostia.
are there not women in Ostia?
you say that so bluntly, Cesare Borgia.
it makes me fearful. - Of what?
of the consequences of your affections.
can you not give thanks for the time we have spent together?
thanks to whom?
to the moon. To Venus.
to, dare I say, the good Lord.
does he not look down upon us this minute?
if he sees what I see, he sees that it is good.
you were ordained a priest, and yet you blaspheme thus.
if appreciation of your beauty is blasphemy, consider me a blasphemer indeed.
a blasphemer and a heretic.
you frighten me, sometimes.
war is ugly, Cardinal.
far uglier than I could ever be.
one should approach it with extreme circumspection.
as one should approach you, perhaps?
he is learning to mean what he says!
but as to war, see here.
my new invention.
if it works, it will be... truly grisly.
it will usher in a whole new era of grisliness.
chained cannonballs.
both balls have to fire together. If they don't, we could be torn to shreds.
you wish to give the signal?
it would be my privilege, Your Highness. - It could also be your end.
your most grisly end. - Yours too.
proceed.
impressive.
yes?
narcissus.
if Lord Sforza were to find us - How could he mount those stairs?
what?
the devil!
butter, my Lord Sforza.
for the morning.
you met my betrothed, Brother? - I did.
your silence is alarming, Brother.
put little Joffre at ease.
rest assured, Joffre, she does not have hos.
is she pretty?
no.
is she kind? - I know not.
does she have any qualities to recommend her?
she has two legs.
the requisite number of eyes. Ten fingers.
so she is not pretty and she is not kind.
she has two eyes, ten fingers, and two legs. - Not forgetting toes.
ten of them, I believe.
I will only marry once, Mother.
little Joffre!
she is not only pretty. - No?
she is beautiful! - Really?
and she's an angel, sprung up on the soils of Naples.
in fact, if you will not marry her, I would marry her myself.
Really? - Yes. Really. Now, do I have your permission?
you may not, Juan. She is my betrothed. - Yes, she is.
and who's a lucky boy?
he looks wealthy. Who is he, do you think?
nobleman?
I don't know. We all look the same when we're dead.
certainly dressed the part.
you would entice me to battle but do you understand what that means?
it means a just war, in defence of Christendom. - No war is just.
war is chaos, brute force mustered against brute force, until one side is destroyed, utterly.
I have read of your Italian battles. Hired mercenaries, on feathered horseback, prancing like peacocks one against the other until one side retires, with something called honour?
but there is no honour in war.
the French learned that against the English.
there is blood, death, armour against armour, until one side surrenders, in death or domination.
be careful what you pray for Cardinal, if you pray for war.
you will find yourself in a place beyond prayer itself.
as St. Augustine said, Mother...
let me be married, Lord, but not yet!
my dear. - Theo.
your dear?
I'd heard you made your reappearance. - Juan.
is the house my father bought you not to your liking?
too cold? Too lonely, perhaps?
I would leave you, kind sir, and trouble you no further.
Yes, you will leave. - MY SON!
Yes, I am your son. Does this peasant's presence here mean that he thinks he's my father?
Juan, PLEASE!
he must have heard the rumours that one of us was fathered by this goatherd.
Juan, stop! - We are the sons of the pope!
and you entertain a goatherd? In my family home?
Juan!
what has this papacy done to you?
it has removed me forever from the likes of him.
go.
leave.
this is your home no longer. - I will return, Mother, when I please.
but I will not have him here! - I said...go.
I asked to meet you here because my husband has been found.
washed up on the shores of the Tiber, 3 weeks dead with stab wounds to his neck.
for those 3 weeks I gave my body to you.
I broke my marriage vows.
I thought perhaps I hoped you did so willingly.
you bought those 3 weeks with murder!
I told you he was riding on the road to Ostia that night.
admit it, Cardinal.
I admit nothing.
yet the crime is written on your face.
there was no murder. He fought. He lost.
I begged you not to meet him.
you begged me not to place myself in harm's way.
I had no idea you had such capabilities.
and to think I thought you knew me.
I thought I knew a man.
a man conflicted, perhaps, between the world and God. But not a murderer.
is it murder to defend your mother's honour?
to procure the freedom of one you could love even more than your mother's honour?
if it is, I am a murderer born.
maybe God can forgive you because I'm not sure I can.
do you think I care for the forgiveness of God?
I care for your happiness, your future.
and I have now given it to you. Libera me, you asked me.
you have not given me a future.
you have given me a lifelong penance.
I am party to your crime.
I feel for you still but I know not this monster beside me.
well, let me tell you.
I was born with a stain.
a mark.
like the mark of Cain.
but it is the mark of my father, my family.
the mark of Borgia.
I have tried to be other than I am.
and I have failed.
and if I have failed you in the process, I am truly sorry.
you...
you have the devil's insight, Cardinal.
you read what my heart wanted and you gave it to me.
you gave me joy, through a crime I could not have conceived of.
and now I must live my life in penance, praying for forgiveness.
where?
you will not know where.
you mean a nunnery?
I mean confinement.
I will search you out.
like Abelard and Eloise.
you may find a nunnery cell, but you will never be free of me!
you are right.
I will never be free of you.
are you out of your mind?
to spill the blood of your mother's husband?
to beat him like a common pimp?
if that is what he is, Father.
if that is what he is, then what does that make you?
you've heard the rumour.
that one of us was sired by him, and not by you, not by the Pope of Rome?
and you want to feed these rumours?
what is all of Rome talking about now? Hmm?
I will not have him in her house!
you will.
you will not?
do you have any idea what lengths I've gone to to keep your mother's reputation intact?
you were bred to be a soldier, a general, a leader of men.
is that any way for a Gonfaloniere to behave?
brawling like a common soldier, in your mother's home?
forgive me, Father, if my honour demanded.
your honour?
do you know what they say about you?
what they whisper about you?
what, Father?
that your brother would be more suited to your estate.
would you have us consider those thoughts?
promise you won't, Father.
if you promise to restrain yourself.
I do.
then promise me that I am of your blood and of no one else's.
you are our son.
no one else's.
do not make us regret that fact.
I will not.
how can I make recompense?
you can beg forgiveness from your mother.
and you can escort her to your brother Joffre's wedding.
Papa.
Papa.
Oh, my love.
I'm in heaven.
or am I still dreaming?
no, Father. It is I.
the Borgia pope has betrothed his son to King Ferrante's daughter.
how does that change matters?
the investiture of Naples must soon follow.
Ferrante would have not agreed to the match without it.
he is old, this Ferrante, and uglier than me.
but his son is not, my liege.
he would see his father invested before he dies, so he can claim the crown, and the kingdom.
if there is a moment to move, it is now.
Cesare!
excuse me, Cardinal. - Yes.
so tell me, Lucrezia.
marriage is...
It...was hard, at first.
but then it grew sweeter.
I need details.
you will not have them.
your husband, Giovanni...
he... fell off his horse.
foolish man.
he will go hunting.
I find the more confined husbands become the more... tolerable.
I could write a book about it.
perhaps I will.
and you, Brother?
what of your heart?
it was broken-by a nun.
a nun? Like Eloise?
will you spend a lifetime writing to her?
I could if I knew where she was.
but you can find out, surely.
I intend to.
how wonderful.
we can both write books.
the cutting of your hair is a symbol of the renunciation of your earthly beauty which is now in the service of our Lord God.
Jesus Christ.
you will be a bride of Christ, a handmaiden of Christ.
christ will be your love, your bread, your wine, your water.
most worthy Lord, do you agree, under the eyes of God, to accept the most gracious Sancia, Duchessa of Squillace, as your lawful spouse?
I do.
she is too beautiful.
I hate her.
you have promised to marry the most gracious Sancia, here present...
if you hate beauty, dear sister, you must hate yourself.
all right.
I will love her then.
but deep down, somewhere, I still hate her.
one can hate and love, I have found.
there was a poem, wasn't there, that said just that.
most gracious lady, do you agree, under the eyes of God, to accept the most noble Lord Joffre as your lawful spouse?
I do.
poor Joffre.
he deserved better than Naples.
are you becoming expert in genealogy?
I have heard the rumours of her monstrous father.
and you believed them?
why Naples?
our father has a realm to protect.
and Sancia will protect it?
we must wait and see...
you are now Duke of Squillace, Joffre Borgia.
how does that feel?
where is Squillace?
I have no idea.
but I am its duchess.
there's a castle, I believe, just south of Naples.
and a lake. An income.
you see, they had to give me something, so they gave me Squillace.
be nice to him.
promise me?
how nice?
he is my younger brother. - Yes.
but how nice?
that nice.
I can be that nice.
you will? - Yes.
good night, pages.
unless you would all join us?
no. That is a step too far, even for the Duke and Duchessa of Squillace.
now, my husband, are you ready?
you will have your war, Cardinal.
but I will only ask one thing of you.
please, my liege.
no one will question the behaviour of my troops, my captains, my generals, my arms.
you will have your war but it will be fought the French way.
are you the one?
Yes, my lady.
I knew I would be whipped.
if you speak of your affections, Paolo, I will see you hanged after you are whipped.
do you understand?
Yes, my lady.
and it would be a shame to maim that body of yours.
for all the pleasure it has given her.
you will prepare us 2 horses at dawn, already saddled.
I had a dream, my son.
or a nightmare.
of Lucrezia?
I dreamed that all of Italy had deserted us
Sforzas, Colonnas.
the French armies swarmed through Rome like a cloud of locusts.
on my feet...
...were the simple sandals of a Spanish peasant.
summon the Spanish ambassador.
he may be our last hope.
you must come with us.
my lord will kill you.
no. He will whip me.
but it will have been worth it.
when will I see you again?
when you return from Rome, perhaps.
when horses fly, as we must now.
before Lord Sforza awakes.
we granted your King Ferdinand and your Queen Isabella the title of Most Catholic Majesties.
we delivered a solemn papal bull, granting them everlasting rights over that vast new continent
but, with respect, Holy Father, what you ask is impossible.
the involvement of Spanish forces in the protection of St. Peter's and the head of Christendom
would amount to a declaration of war between France and Spain.
I warn you, Ambassador, favours granted can be rescinded.
and I would beg Your Holiness's forgiveness that I cannot meet his full demands.
must we face this...
...French apocalypse alone?
the populace is already fleeing Rome.
please thank Their Royal Catholic Highnesses.
and tell them...
...ur Saviour was kissed thus by Judas Iscariot.
we would review whatever forces we have at our disposal.
Where's your brother?
I know not, Holy Father, but...
...I suspect.
well, then, seek out the Gonfaloniere of the papal forces from whatever whorehouse he's seen fit to rest his head!
you know this man?
no, Father. He had no name last night.
brother. - You have a priest for a brother?
a cardinal. - A cardinal?
I should have charged you double.
I imagine you did.
your father would review the forces at his command, Gonfaloniere.
I am out of sorts this morning, brother.
this afternoon.
you know me, brother.
I disapprove of lechery, debauchery, drunkenness.
which is why our father made you the cardinal.
why, then, did he make you a duke?
because lechery and debauchery are the very marks of nobility.
most of Italy has galloped to the French side.
they have heard a sound that is new to their Italian ears: the sound of cannon.
and the Gonfaloniere has other duties besides lechery and debauchery.
there is the tedious business of war.
slow your horse, my love.
you were ill, remember?
and your condition needs nurturing.
once out of that gloomy castle, my health seems to improve.
we did doubly well to flee, then, and your father needs us both at this perilous juncture.
now, you tell me about this Paolo.
you mean Narcissus?
what would you know?
everything.
where are they heading?
the horses were gone, my lord, at dawn. I know not where.
you mean they saddled them without you stirring?
they must have, my lord.
you sleep very soundly.
like a babe in arms, my lord.
you lie.
would it be in my interest to lie, my lord, when my back is at your mercy?
your entire being is at my mercy.
the truth, peasant!
where are they heading?
she is headed as far from you as possible, my lord.
she can no longer stand the sight of you.
the smell of you.
the thought of you.
and nor, my lord, can I.
peasant.
we have pikes for 2, 000 footmen, lances for 1, 000 horse, bows for 1, 500 bowmen-- if we can find the soldiers to wield them.
what about cannon?
nobody worthy in the art of war ever uses cannons.
I have heard it rumoured that the French do.
and I have heard that they are vulgarians, my lord.
their cannon was vulgar, indeed, when they brought Lucca to its knees.
I have a stratagem, Holy Father, to outwit their cannon.
would you be so good as to...
share it with us?
indeed. Just give me some time with my condottieri.
time is what we do not have!
the barbarians are approaching.
Rome has been sacked twice in her past.
we would spare her a third such indignity.
cardinal.
there are precedents, of course, Your Highness, for the deposition of the Pope of Rome.
the Council of Constance, for example.
there were 3 popes with claims upon the papacy.
three?
it was a schism, Your Highness, a state to be avoided at all costs.
Pope John XXIII, Pope Benedict XIII, and Pope Gregory XII.
one of them held court in Avignon.
Yes, Your Highness.
commonly referred to as the Avignon Captitivy.
and what was the outcome of the Council of Constance?
well, Pope John XXIII was accused of various indiscretions.
and of what do you accuse this Borgia pope?
simony, usury, public lechery, and poisoning, perhaps.
so, your brother has a stratagem.
dreamed up in last night's whorehouse.
you will cease, Cardinal Borgia, in this constant denigration of your brother, the Gonfaloniere.
his leadership of the papal forces is at present our only hope!
which is the source of my concern, Father.
we have summoned an assembly of the College of Cardinals.
now, we are aware- painfully aware-- how readily they would abandon our papacy in this hour of greatest need.
but you, Cardinal, shall be our support in this crisis.
you will express every confidence in the arms at our disposal, under the leadership of your beloved brother.
they are like rats, my son, deserting a sinking ship.
thus our Saviour was abandoned by his Apostles, in his hour of greatest need.
...without protection, everyone moment we stay here is at our peril.
holy Father, it is rumoured that the Colonna arms are rushing to join the French side.
cardinal Colonna could perhaps answer that.
they are in danger of being beaten to the race by the armies of the Sforza.
cardinal Sforza?
holy Father, we should abandon Rome.
half the populace already has.
the Holy Father forbids any talk of abandonment.
we have all of us taken our vows as cardinals to spill our blood in defence of our Holy Mother Church.
we wait like lambs to be slaughtered?
the Holy Father has reviewed the papal forces.
he has every confidence in their ability to defend the Holy City.
as have I!
too often has iths city been abandoned at a time of intimate threat.
we have all of us been chosen by God...
...to represent his Holy Church.
and who knows?
perhaps God in His infinite wisdom has sent us this trial, this...
test of our faith in Him.
the Pope of Rome shall stay in Rome, in the Vatican, in St. Peter's.
and he has every confidence that the College of Cardinals shall do so too.
each one of you shall be called to account.
do not let the Most High God find you wanting.
it is settled then.
we shall stay in Rome.
see, up ahead.
who is it?
we must turn back.
they are French, are they not?
these are dangerous roads, fair ladies.
so it seems.
and you are heading?
to Rome.
well, then.
you have an escort of French arms.
bring them! - Yes, Captain!
en allez!
on the way!
what is cannon for, Holy Father?
for destroying fortification, surely.
exactly.
the French cannon may be useful to batter the gates of Rome, or to blow the walls of Lucca to the heavens, but meet them in the open field, and what use are their cannon there?
my son.
and I propose our armies do precisely that.
meet them far from Rome in the open field, where the advantage of their cannon is like blowing thistles in the wind.
our cavalry can feint around their rear, our bowmen target their gunners.
the Roman genius is for strategy and rapid movement; let us use it to the full.
and annihilate those French barbarians with their lumbering metal cannon.
see how fast they can turn them round.
do you agree, brother?
I know little of the art of war.
well, thank God someone in this family does.
we shall outwit them before they even get sight of our fair city, Rome.
and like Julius Caesar, like Mark Anthony, we will chase those barbarian invaders back across the Alps, dragging their cannon with them.
Am...I...correct, Father?
well, we can breathe again, my son.
the air is almost sweet with relief.
you...
...will be the saviour of Rome.
will the good Lord see the justice in our cause, Micheletto?
where warfare is concerned, Your Eminence, our good Lord will take a holiday.
have you ever seen such an army?
not since Hannibal crossed the Alps, my lady.
that is what my brother faces.
your brother is a Roman soldier?
he is to be pitied, then.
you must introduce us to your Hannibal, Captain.
and your names are?
tell him that Lucrezia Borgia, daughter to the Pope of Rome, and Giulia Farnese request the pleasure of his company.
we have a captive, my liege.
what kind of captive?
quite a prize, I am told.
a Borgia. - A Borgia?
the pope's bastard daughter, fleeing her husband, Giovanni Sforza.
ran into our hands. - A hostage, then?
if it pleases you.
and the pope's own mistress, Giulia Farnese.
this pope has a mistress?
for shame.
then he must surely be done away with.
why have I no mistress, General?
we need a stratagem, Giulia Farnese.
how to achieve our freedom.
we are quite uniquely situated to use what...
...weapons we have in our father's cause.
and what weapons are those, my love?
as you told me when I first met you: our beauty.
our wit.
cardinal.
la bella.
I trust the French soldiery caused you both no disquiet?
are we hostages, Cardinal?
on the contrary, Madame, you are being detained for your own protection.
good!
I would not like to be imprisoned.
it would so displease my father, the pope.
as, I am afraid, would your presence here.
no longer a man of God?
a soldier now?
I serve still God, my lady.
that would please my father.
he would not like to see blood on a cardinal's hands.
so why are you here with the French armies?
I am in your presence to invite you both to dine with His Royal Highness, King Charles of France.
which invitation we graciously accept, do we not, Lucrezia?
but you have not yet told us, Cardinal, why you are here with the French armies?
I am travelling with the French king to institute the deposition of your father as Pope of Rome.
Oh, dear.
that is certainly a reason.
on what grounds?
simony, bribery, and if you will both forgive my mention of such indelicacies fair ladies, public lechery.
public lechery?
with whom?
with your good self, my lady.
so a pope cannot be lecherous, Cardinal, in public or in private?
he cannot, my lady.
but is a pope's daughter allowed to be hungry?
if so, I would gladly accept the king's invitation.
because this pope's daughter...
...could eat a horse.
we are unused to kings in Italy, Your Highness.
we do have dukes, duchesses, principes, cardinals.
we even have, as you must know, a pope.
but kings are in short supply.
I have novelty value, then.
no more wine for the moment.
why not?
I would tell Your Highness's fortune.
his fortune? - Yes. In the cup.
my mother taught me.
she was a courtesan, Your Highness.
Really?
the prettiest in Rome.
and she knew her runes.
I see...
...one great army...
...meet another.
is there a winner?
there.
and I see his face.
is it handsome, this face?
no, I would not call iant hdsome.
is it... ugly, then?
no. - No.
but there is a great...
blemish upon it.
what is this blemish?
come closer, my liege.
I would have you see it too.
it looks alarmingly like a nose.
a nose!
is it ugly, this nose?
it is exceedingly ugly, Your Highness.
like mine?
no, not at all like yours.
the visage I saw in this cup was not yours, Your Highness.
it has none of the grace, the valour, the openness.
and now...
it is gone.
more wine for His Highness.
and the winner that you saw in the cup, Lucrezia...
was not as handsome as you, Your Highness.
nor as gracious.
nor as kind.
has he a name?
nobody.
there was no winner.
no loser either.
and no battle?
what a pity.
your Highness likes battle?
longs for it.
let me show you, fair Lucrezia, our ways of battle tomorrow.
my God.
so our stratagem was, Gonfaloniere, a feint to their left.
but I can see no left.
or right.
their army fills the whole horizon.
the pikes of our infantry are 12 feet long.
can you see them there, my dear?
why are the blades hooked so, my lord?
so they can tear out the guts of their opponents.
but we begin battle with the cannon.
the cannon? - Yes.
never risk a man until you've used your artillery.
learned that against the English.
I thought cannon were for purposes of siege, to break down walls, and such.
Ah, but in the open field, we have our own invention.
chained cannonballs.
chained cannonballs?
cuts through a front line like a scythe through butter.
cannons! Man the cannons! Cannons! Soldiers! At the ready.
man the cannons!
prepare to load!
Cannoneers to your guns!
who gives the command to charge?
you do, my lord.
load the cannons!
load powder!
is the cannon loud, Your Highness?
exceedingly.
I would cover your ears, my dear.
back in positions!
target ready! Cannon ready, Captain.
central cannons, fire!
fire!
run! Fire!
fall back! Fall back! Stay in line, men!
back to the front! Back, men, to the front!!
central cannons reload!
reload! Check the distance!
your Highness? - Yes, my dear?
could you halt the cannon for a moment?
pardon?
could you halt the cannon for a moment?
but why?
you were right.
they are exceedingly loud.
ready, Captain!
your Highness?
wait.
stand fast, men!
is it the white flag?
a parlay?
it's my sister.
we are in danger of losing the initiative, Your Highness-- Shh!
your Highness, I strongly urge you to take-- You will wait.
I will not harm her.
Lucrezia. My God.
they hold us hostage, brother.
us? - Giulia Farnese and I.
we were riding to Rome.
ride on then.
would you survive this day, dear Juan?
we have a battle to fight.
believe me, you have lost it already.
it has hardly begun.
I have heard one roar of cannon.
a hundred more and your whole army will be dead and bleeding.
and you have yet to see their pikes.
I will not accept defeat!
then do not call it that.
call it common sense.
say the French King got asked for terms.
you offered...
what did I offer?
his safe passage to Naples in exchange for...
...his bloodless entry into Rome.
Lucrezia, he will pillage the place; depose our father!
leave that to me.
yah! Ready!
target ready! Target ready!
it was my brother, Your Highness!
your brother?
the Gonfaloniere of the papal armies.
he thought you meant to sack Rome.
like the Goths and Vandal hordes.
I told him you were a gentleman.
you had no such idea.
you had no such idea, had you?
no such idea.
your goal is Naples.
Naples. Of course.
so, my brother, the Duke of Gandia, the Gonfaloniere of the papal armies, bids you welcome to Rome.
forward!
why the hurry, Cardinal?
you have heard?
we have heard the sun rose as always this morning.
we have heard a lark singing through the casement window.
but the Sistine choir at matins was silent.
perhaps they have heard what you have heard.
your son's army is in retreat.
the French plague is almost upon us.
did you not swear a solemn oath, when you first donned that cardinal's red, to spill your blood in defence of the Christian faith?
my cardinal's oath is not the issue here.
then what is? - You, Holy Father!
the French King has but one intent: your deposition.
I understand.
you would protect yourselves and not us.
you could ride with us, Holy Father, to the safety of Ostia.
our place is here.
as is yours, Cardinal Sforza.
you should leave, Holy Father.
we will stay here.
and we shall be here when you return.
if you return.
you may need those tomes, Burchart, in whatever haven you are fleeing to.
I would preserve these books for posterity, Your Holiness.
for posterity?
they have survived many invasions.
I will do my best to ensure they survive this one.
take care, then, you preserve this book on the Council of Constance.
you may need it in the near future.
why, Your Holiness?
for the proceedings of our deposition.
and if you are asked for an opinion, you will state-- as I know you will
that a College of Cardinals which elected a pope deemed to be iniquitous can itself depose said iniquitous pope.
must you all desert me?
I would preserve these books, Your Holiness.
I know, I know.
for posterity.
do they look victorious, Micheletto?
no, Your Eminence.
they are merely tired and exhausted.
the exhaustion of battle, surely.
the exhaustion of retreat.
is that why I see no prisoners?
you see no prisoners because there are none.
and Rome is like an old whore, waiting once more for her ravishment.
father.
do not blame him, Cesare, for retreating before the French hordes.
they have Lucrezia as hostage. Have you heard?
if they harm her...
cowards.
vermin!
rats deserting a sinking ship!
you're like lemmings running to your doom!
do you think a golden chalice will save you?
your brother did not fail, Cesare. Your father did.
your father, who placed that responsibility upon his shoulders.
who was blinded...
...By paternal fondness.
your fheatr, who has been abandoned by all that once supported him.
your father, who...
...faces his dark night of the soul.
alone.
I will not leave you, Father.
father.
my son. - We had no choice but retreat.
there's not a moment to lose.
so we believe.
the guards will take you to safety in Ostia.
no, we will stay here in Rome, my son.
the Castell St. Angelo then.
we will stay here in this Vatican.
the papal guard and yourself will take your mother to safety in Ostia.
but Father...
would you see her defenceless before the French invasion?
go.
go!
at times such as these, Brother Raphael...
...one needs old friends.
we have been called to trial.
we hope we will not be found wanting.
your very presence here, Your Holiness, attests that you have not.
attests.
I like that word, good friar.
it speaks of fortitude in the face of threat.
it speaks of bearing witness in the face of falsity.
it speaks of...
...courage.
your clothes.
my clothes?
your humble tunic.
the cowl you wear. Those unadorned sandals.
but why do you need my clothes, Holy Father?
we would wear them.
you would disguise yourself?
no, not at all.
I would face this trial that approaches, against which the entirety of Rome has fled, without the trappings of Holy Office.
I would face it as our Saviour faced His great trial: in a simple robe, sandals on our bare feet, with nothing but our faith in God to adorn us.
why are you here?
I want you to leave.
I cannot. I have taken vows.
you will be defenceless when the French army arrives.
I must put my trust in Jesus, then.
no.
you will put your trust in me.
I will not have you without protection.
do you not understand?
I cannot have you near me, Cesare.
I would betray our Saviour in a moment.
you said my name.
I have......made a promise.
a sacred vow.
I am sorry.
will you allow me to at least afford the abbey protection?
place guards on the gates?
you are our benefactor, Cardinal.
well.
now is the time of reckoning.
our task is of vengeance. But you must know by now, Cardinal.
work with us. Not against us.
we are family! We are one!
and we will only triumph as one!
we will have none of that; you are brothers, after all.
is His Holiness lacking something?
does my presence no longer fill him with joy?
you're very young, beautiful.
you are more Eve than Adam.
we propose a celebration for the entire populace of Rome.
whatever the cost.
let Rome be full of joy!
I gave my body to you. I broke my marriage vows.
you bought those three weeks with murder. Admit it, Cardinal.
I will search you out.
you may find a nunnery but you will never be free of me.
tell me again, my love. Who was his father?
a groom, Paolo.
impossible loves; they can become an addiction.
you fear for the constancy of your lover's affections? Don't do as I did.
allow him his fancy. Let him look both ways.
but be sure one of those gazes falls on you.
good, good!
excuse me, old man.
which way is Rome?
can you not smell it, from here?
does Rome smell? It stinks.
what do you want in Rome? I have a child there.
pity the poor child, then. Rome.
good!
get on! Go on!
we had a dream.
we were a trinity upon this bed last night.
what if there was no dream?
and we were three indeed.
was it by our invitation or by yours?
our memory is...
I'm afraid it was I, Your Holiness.
shall I be whipped for my offence?
you should be bound and whipped and ravaged.
when?
often.
you may leave us, sisters. Your Eminence. Your Eminence.
sister Martha. Cardinal.
you know what this is?
it is the fresco you have so graciously commissioned, Cardinal.
of the founder of our order.
St. Cecelia, the patron saint of music.
but it lacks a model. Which is why I have asked for you.
I am afraid I cannot. And I am afraid you must.
I am the Abbey's benefactor, after all.
St. Cecelia was renowned for her beauty.
but St. Cecilia was no nun, Your Eminence.
but if you would allow me...
you offend me, Cardinal! Perhaps.
I am sorry for it.
but I would restore this hair to what it was before God snatched it from me.
cardinal, please.
I know, I know. I blaspheme.
but it's for a higher purpose.
can you restore her hair, Pinturicchio? Gladly.
and can you make those lips live again?
from a throne to a Judas chair.
who could have thought it? Certainly not Prince Alfonso.
did you revive him often?
seven times, through one long night.
can you imagine pain, Doctor?
pain such as this.
I imagine it hurts.
and enough of this sophistry.
indeed. To work.
your Eminence.
you will die, Your Eminence, if you eat nothing, drink only rainwater!
I can trust only the rain, Sister.
we cook our own food!
who provides the grains? The meat?
is there no persuading the Cardinal?
perhaps a monkey...
a monkey?
a capuchin monkey.
some bread sir?
you are looking for a lady, young handsome man?
how did you know?
I imagine everyone walking these streets is looking for a lady.
what's her name? Come on now. She must have a name.
Lucrezia. I know a few Lucrezias!
she is noble, my Lucrezia.
you saying I'm not noble?
I would not be so bold, my lady.
your lady? Right.
I am your lady.
and I'll find you your Lucrezia.
can you never rest?
where do you sleep?
under silk covers, last night.
no, on a normal night?
on a straw bed on a studio floor.
so you know the streets of Rome?
the slums, the tenements.
you live among the common people? I am one of them, Your Holiness.
not for long, I would hazard, knowing your talents.
does the Pope of Rome not know his flock?
you have seen the gilded cage we live within.
we meet princes and potentates and prelates.
but very few of the common people.
we might need your assistance.
Ah, Cardinal Sforza.
you have come to view our...
Roman treasures? Etruscan, I would wager.
Ah, the cardinal is an expert on such matters.
the cardinal has seen Donatello's David and marvelled at the source of its eros.
now he knows. The cardinal thinks there may be scandal perhaps?
the cardinal does not care.
what the cardinal does care about are the Vatican finances.
Ah, yes.
you will excuse us, young maestro.
maestro? Well, assistant now, but he- Oy.
this nice young man here is looking for a Lucrezia.
do we have any Lucrezias? I'll be Lucrezia.
for a consideration. Her name is Magdelena.
I am Lucrezia. Oh, shut up, you trollop.
we'll all be Lucrezia for you.
do we have a second name? Borgia.
Lucrezia Borgia? She'd cost more than a shilling.
you do her a disservice, my lady. And I must consider this conversation to be at an end.
you mean the pope's daughter? I'd try the Vatican if I were you.
the Vatican finances- Are like Cardinal Piccolomini's hair.
getting thin? Cardinal Piccolomini is bald.
but he had hair once. And our beloved Vatican had finances once.
but His Holiness's celebrations have reduced them to a state akin to baldness.
but you are the vice chancellor. Vatican finances are your responsibility!
do something about it! We have hardly begun our task for the renewal of Rome.
the restoration of its historic monuments, our transformation of the lives and futures of its common people.
what does His Holiness know of the lives of the common people?
I would remind the Cardinal that unlike him we were born amongst them.
his Holiness's roots were in Spain, I believe. When he came here he was already a great prelate.
so I would ask him again, what does he know of the lives of the common people of Rome?
well, perhaps the cardinal would be so kind one evening as to walk us amongst them?
his Holiness must know that that is impossible
for either of us.
as, I'm sorry to say, is this project of renewal.
does the monkey have a name?
let us call him...
stop. You mock me, fair lady.
if I did, forgive me... kind sir.
my name is Paolo.
I mistook you for a client.
a girl has to work.
must you so debase yourself?
if I do not lift my skirts, I'll starve.
better to starve, surely. What, like the rest of Rome?
they were fed yesterday. But today they starve.
but there is such wealth in evidence here, my lady. How could anybody starve?
there is wealth, of course. But we starve.
whilst Lucrezia Borgia dines on a silver plate.
with a fork.
you have heard of a fork, Paolo?
no, my lady.
it is all the rage now.
and I'll bet Lucrezia Borgia dines with a fork of solid gold.
your day of celebration, Holy Father, was a great success. Triumph.
the mob does need bread and circuses.
the mob?
he means the people. I mean the mob.
but isn't the mob made up of people?
is this a riddle, Holy Father?
well, wouldn't you be one of them if you took away your titles,
Gonfaloniere, your dukedom, your linens and your laces- and your filigree codpiece?
it was a riddle. A bad one.
well, riddle me this.
when Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?
there are distinctions, Father, in the natural order of things between the peasant and the nobleman.
between the stallion and the mule.
between us and the common people? Of course.
but we all have an eternal soul.
tell me, if we were to go out one evening amongst the common people, which of you, our family, would guide us? You would need protection, Father.
the Pope cannot just walk amongst that rabble like one of them.
why not? Our Saviour did. Yes, but he was not the pope, was he, Father?
you see, it was a riddle, after all.
Ragazzi.
be careful.
how can people live like this? Because they have no alternative.
that shoe's worth something! Let her go! Fancy shoe... fancy blade...
go, go, go, go, go, go! Who are you?
alms, alms!
for the love of God! To feed the infant!
that child is dead.
to bury the infant then!
a grave costs money, even a pauper's grave!
come! Now, sir, sir!
the Roman emperors had their faults, Your Holiness.
as do we.
but they kept order on their streets...
and they provided water for their people.
they built aqueducts, they provided sanitation.
Yes, and now people sleep in filth.
pigeons everywhere.
where do they come from, these pigeons?
this was a bath house once, dedicated to the Goddess Sulis Minerva.
now the orphans of Rome make their bed amongst its ruins.
among the rats and the pigeons?
go on!
did Rome once provide for them? The pigeons?
no, Your Holiness. The orphans.
there is an entire branch of the Curia dedicated to charitable works.
but its bounty never reaches them.
well, we must see that it does.
come.
all right.
we will have you, Giulia Farnese, go through their curatorial accounts.
and ensure that money for the poor actually reaches the poor.
three!
will I have your full authority?
you will.
and we shall set ourselves another task.
to rid this city of its infestation of pigeons.
more wine!
and then we'll see who will be the most successful.
Hmm... Is this a challenge?
a wager.
which is the greater task, poverty or pigeons? Four!
now we will have two solidus on number one.
one! And we win!
you must insist the cardinal eats.
I will, sister.
he has a terror of food, since the event.
but if little Julius here deigns to eat, the cardinal will partake too...
I understand.
see him safe to the monastery in Perugia.
the brothers will arrange his passage to Rome. God be with you, Your Eminence.
cardinal Versucci. Your Holiness.
please.
you have been in charge of the office of public works for how many years?
as long as I have been cardinal, Your Holiness.
Ah. Two decades, then.
after which time the orphans of Rome find themselves destitute, and the cardinal has built himself how many palaces?
three.
you see the irony there?
the poor will be always with us, Your Holiness.
the poor. Like the pigeons.
I beg your pardon? Your Holiness.
does the cardinal believe that pigeons will be always with us?
is this a riddle?
we will have curatorial funds used for their declared purposes.
money destined for the poor should go to the poor!
so we will have you go through
the last two decades of your accounts with one we have designated to supervise them.
the Lady Giulia Farnese.
what Your Holiness proposes is unthinkable! What?
that monies destined for the poor should go to the poor?
that a woman should have access to curatorial accounts.
can a woman not count? Add, subtract?
count her children, perhaps.
there is a new method, Cardinal, devised by the Florentine bankers.
it is called double-entry book keeping.
it proves a valuable tool in tracing all missing funds.
so, the cardinal shall help you in your efforts to source those missing funds while we shall attend to another matter of what is of some import.
your Holiness.
cardinal.
so, you say a falcon eats pigeon?
when he can get one, in his natural habitat,
what is his natural habitat?
the forest of Umbria, Your Holiness.
he should be in paradise here in Rome.
think he's hungry now? Starving, Your Holiness.
well then.
Oh ho ho! Look it!
you must get me a battalion of those birds.
these are dangerous roads, Sister. I have heard so.
but you have a precious load there.
why do you say so, sir?
to keep it so well hidden.
but then...
...you keep your own beauty hidden.
forgive me, Sister.
sometimes goodness needs the help of a little badness.
lord have mercy.
you can ply your sad trade upon the Vatican steps?
there's no better place, my love.
and a cleric's skirt is easier to lift than a codpiece.
I have spent many profitable hours beneath them.
however noisome this Roman air, the Roman populace deserves their glimpse of us.
they have a thousand eyes, the mob, and those eyes will be fed, occasionally.
will you make your wish at Agatha's fountain? Yes, Brother.
I would throw a coin in the waters and say a prayer for my little Giovanni.
on blessed Saint Agatha's Day.
I hate Saint Agatha's Day.
stay close to me.
go away.
let me hear your wish, Sis.
my wish is for the fountain's ears alone, Juan.
make your own.
Lucrezia. My God, what effrontery!
a peasant to a pope's daughter?
I should colour this market with your blood!
let him be! Let him be!
you know this commoner? I do not.
then I will cut out his impertinent tongue. Do not ruin this day for me, dear brother.
let the commoner keep his tongue. He may need it in the future to explain his impertinence.
there will be more impertinence? No, my good lord.
and I beg your lady's pardon for any offence.
if there is anything I can do to make good my offence... There may be.
then, my lady, I would hear of it. Say a prayer by this fountain.
at midnight. Midnight.
and beg forgiveness of St. Agatha.
now be gone, while you yet have a tongue to speak with.
I beg pardon, my lord! Scatter!
Oh, thank you, kind father.
you look happy.
I have seen heaven.
I've seen it too. From a different angle.
was your heaven worth it?
Yes.
and if I understood her rightly, I'll see her again. Who?
my Heaven. Oh Paolo. You just made me cry.
please don't. Unless they be tears of happiness, of course.
just promise me...
you'll be careful, huh?
you have your spies, do you not? Who told you that?
a spy, of course.
we would have our ear to the ground in Naples.
Naples is unhealthy, Father. So we have heard.
prince Alfonso is no longer with us.
that is tragic, indeed.
he would have made a good match for your sister Lucrezia. What's a prince without a kingdom?
it will not always be thus.
king Charles cannot remain in Naples forever.
unless he wants to die of the pestilence himself.
but if he does have plans to leave that blessed kingdom, we would be the first to know of it.
watch over him this evening, Nurse.
may I? Please.
I have business to attend to. Certainly, my lady.
was that was my coin?
how would I know?
because there was a wish attached to it.
my Paolo. Is it really you? It is nobody else, my lady.
I have missed you so. As I have missed you.
but you know, my love, it is impossible.
impossible.
have you not yet read your romances?
I know, I know.
you still cannot read.
it's a bit past her bedtime, isn't it? Oh hush, would you.
so why did you come?
to punish me with longing?
I would see my son.
it was a son, was it not? It was.
a beautiful little boy.
I would see my boy before I die.
please, Paolo, do not mention death.
for you may die, if you stay in Rome.
then I will not stay in Rome.
but if there is any kindness in your Borgia blood, you would let me see you with my son before I leave.
were you not whipped, Paolo?
my back was at your husband's mercy.
Oh Lord.
is that what it is like?
love?
it must be.
I'll save myself for business then. One night.
if you promise me that you will leave Rome.
is Rome so deadly?
for innocents like you.
so promise me.
and meet me here again tomorrow night.
I promise.
Oh, do I hear the rattle of gold in your pocket, sir?
this coin is for the fountain.
it would find a better home here.
those lovers, do you know them?
that's the pope's daughter, Lucrezia Borgia.
to so shame herself in public?
with whom?
are you paying, sir?
some country bumpkin.
father of her bastard child. You would earn more of that gold coin?
where should we go, kind sir?
nowhere.
but I would have that bumpkin followed day and night.
so I needn't lift my skirt tonight?
no. Not tonight.
is he sleeping, Nurse?
he did miss his mother.
Cesare. You have a lover, Sis?
no, Brother.
but this child has a father. A stable hand.
who has come to Rome.
unwise.
you disapprove? Not yet.
which is why you go out hooded.
at night. Like a phantom.
Cesare, he suffered for me in absolute silence.
he would have died for me.
the least I can do is let him see his child. You loved him, Sis?
I did.
perhaps I do.
then you must see him.
you would help me?
once.
and only once.
just tell me what to do.
find us a room.
where we can spend one night together away from prying eyes. One night.
you promise.
I promise.
go to our mother's house, tomorrow evening.
she needs to see her grandchild, does she not?
And?
leave the rest to me.
you afraid, boy?
I was waiting.
I had hoped for someone...
one a lot prettier than I, perhaps yes? Perhaps.
are you saying that I'm not pretty? I have killed for less.
but not tonight.
come.
you are looking for your love. Yes?
then come.
what is your name, boy? Paolo.
tell me about love, Paolo.
I know nothing of love.
should I absent myself?
so my presence doesn't implicate me? In what, Mother?
a love that would displease your father.
is there such a thing? No.
your father is the pope of love.
but I would keep this tryst a secret, Mother.
Yes, I am aware.
affections can be lethal in this Rome of ours.
he has a right to see his son. He does.
but only once. Come, Mother.
let us dine together. Have you dismissed the servants?
of course.
tell me.
love.
what does it feel like?
it hurts.
Ah, like life.
yes?
like Micheletto.
my baby! Let me hold him.
does he have a name? Giovanni.
Giovanni. Say "Papa.
he's the most beautiful thing I've yet seen. yes...
I feel sorriest for him.
this needs to be our secret, Mother.
you know how I love secrets.
four noble women, all from the house of Castille.
so you would marry me to Spain?
well, it would be quite a natural alliance.
and Lucrezia?
would you marry her again? In time.
to a nobleman or a commoner?
what? A commoner?
is that wine going to your head?
look, stop drinking for a while and make a choice!
sister slut.
fuck off, whoever you are.
what are you, uh-you're busy tonight?
Yes.
but tonight I keep my skirts on.
pity.
no pity at all. It pays better. What does?
spying.
makes a change from fucking.
spying.
for who?
that gentleman there?
how did you know? I read your mind.
were you expecting visitors? No.
I would speak with my mother. Of what?
of a peasant from Pesaro.
who's had his way with our dear sister and made his way to Rome.
to what purpose?
if she finds that dog sniffing around our family,
I would have news of it.
she is sleeping, Juan. And you are drunk.
do you really want to her to see you like this?
tomorrow then.
best tomorrow.
was that an infant crying?
it was from my dovecote.
you loved those doves. Yes. And you woke them.
shame on you.
do you love me, Brother?
I would kill for you.
but do you love me?
as I love myself.
which, these days, is not a lot.
you are observant.
but you love your family.
and your family name.
he must feed now. And I must leave.
I wish it were different. But, yes, you must.
and by the back door, the back streets.
I would gladly die for you both.
I know.
so go now, my love.
I would have you live.
I will write.
you know I cannot read.
well, you must learn then.
who walks with me?
I mean you no harm, kind sir, whoever you may be.
suicide. A sin even the pope can't forgive.
because dead men can't confess, can they?
tell your tale to the river.
Yes.
Yes, sh, sh.
Yes.
the vultures are circling our family.
our Rome.
we must remove him from the chair of St. Peter's-and from this world.
vengeance is mine, saieth the Lord.
Ah, vengeance will be ours.
Catherina Sforza. If she does not kiss the papal ring, we will drag her in chains through the streets of Rome!
you would have me kneel to him?
bow?
I only kneel when it suits me.
Catherina Sforza shared her bed with me.
did she beg to be friends with us?
now we're in need of another alliance!
I will not marry.
it is a daughter's duty to marry her father's choice!
journey to Rome!
I will never bend my knee to the whore master of Rome.
fire!
we are under attack!
what should have been a glorious victory is an ignominious defeat.
father, we must discuss our brother.
he is hurtling towards ruin.
he will drag this whole family with him.
sleep well.
the pope is surrounded by a ring of steel.
I propose we use the weapon the Borgia family uses
Canterella.
I would gladly die to rid the world of the Borgia pope.
the thought of marriage turns my stomach.
the warm touch of a lover might ease the pain.
we grow weary of this game.
it is no game.
you are marrying for all of us, Lucrezia!
for family!
who are you?
I'm Prince Alfonso d'Aragona, suitor to the Lady Lucrezia.
Yes, I will marry him.
he has all the sweetness of an apple on the tree.
you want to inhabit my shoes, carry my sword.
you must resign yourself, Cesare.
one day you'll realize that everything I've done has been for your own good.
leave my baby!
Juan, leave my baby alone!
I will not have this family torn apart!
help him through his dark night.
have you come to beg forgiveness for your insult?
you're already forgiven.
we're Borgias.
we never forgive.
your brother murdered in cold blood.
who would do such a thing?
many people, Father.
I have wished him dead a thousand times.
find his murderer.
scour all Italy!
there will be no need of that.
do you know who did this?
I have taken upon my head the act that none other would dare commit.
if I cannot have your affection, can you at least grant me your forgiveness?
we realize now that we have brought this upon ourselves.
father!
help!
come with me! Hurry!
father!
stand back!
make way!
move! Move aside!
seal the city!
close the gates!
make way! Make way, make way.
Cantarella.
what can you do?
nothing, His soul is already departing this world.
his soul does not depart until I give it leave!
But-there is nothing-there is no remedy, no antidote
there is nothing to cure such a case.
there is something - charcoal.
but I have only read of it, never seen it done.
I need water, water.
open his mouth.
get this down.
come on! Help me!
force it in until he can bear no more.
and if he vomits, force more. You understand me?
but, this is witchcraft.
this is physick!
get to it! - Do what she says.
every detail.
and, if his soul departs, I shall ensure it does not do so alone.
hand me water.
push this down his throat!
get these people out of here.
I want this room clear.
gratia plena.
dominus tecum...
...benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus.
pater noster, qui es in caelis, sanctificetur
I found this in the boy's cell.
a Dominican salter in a Franciscan cell?
I have closed the city.
I must leave. Do what you can.
keep going come on
the last words I spoke to him...
it's not yet too late.
who's there, Brother?
stop! This is the house of God.
and God is angry.
where is Della Rovere?
my lord. Cantarella.
you, where he is?
tell me where you have hidden Della Rovere
or your life is forfeit.
show me - or I will gut you like a fish.
you threaten me?
we are men of God!
men of God who have conspired to murder my father.
your father.
did you really think I would not find you out?
look at me.
show me.
show him.
get up!
there is nothing more I know to do.
well, we cannot leave him here.
come.
we've lost him.
may not be answered.
on the nature of your prayers.
but should he die...
there will be opportunity.
there will be mayhem.
the Holy Spirit wants a Roman.
we should decide amongst ourselves.
find the safest pair of Italian hands and bless the martyr who brought about this outcome.
one of the great Italian families.
colonna, De Luca,
Piccolimini, Sforza, Versucci...
Orsini. - Yes.
he could be anywhere.
his arm, lift his arm.
I would need to know where you consider me.
della ROVERE: Cardinal Orsini.
cardinal DeLuca.
cardinal Colonna.
cardinal Sforza.
my brothers; I came as soon as I heard.
as soon as you heard.
of the pope's death.
cardinal Della Rovere, your information somewhat pre-empts the matter.
he lives?
in nomine Patri et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, amen.
the life has not left him yet, Eminence.
Cesare!
you!
your blade! Cesare! Put up your blade!
Cesare!
the least disturbance may tip the balance.
Cesare-please!
now think!
think of what?
of what happens next.
of what becomes of us if he dies.
you, me, Lucrezia.
do you think we've made friends here?
do you think we can turn to our allies?
where are these allies, Cesare?
who are our friends?
I'm not pope. Neither are you.
without him, what becomes of us?
will he die?
it hangs in the balance.
then we must wait to see which way the balance falls.
meanwhile, look to me for your safety.
we should align ourselves now to reap what we can.
an Italian then?
he has been long in the wilderness.
how long will any of the Borgias survive once he's gone?
I want the treasury.
and I want land.
he won't sleep.
take him back to the villa.
put him in his bed there.
we'll join you as soon as we know his grandfather's fate.
thank you.
be safe.
Yes, my lady.
you should go too. It's not safe here.
if it's not safe for me, how can it be safe for you?
it's not.
but I am a Borgia, and my place is here.
go back to your villa and...
when this is over - one way or the other
I will send for you, never fear.
I would protect you, you know.
the time may come.
but not now.
blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
holy Mary, Mother of God, Pray for us sinners...
cardinal...
tell me - um...
where are the lines of allegiance?
do not tell me that my father did not have you with your ear pressed to the wall on such matters.
I wish to know.
which cardinals owe favours to which other cardinals?
who is in whose pocket? Who seeks the papacy?
and who merely wishes an easy life?
you know all this, do you not?
Yes, your father encouraged me to, uh...
...to know all of this.
And?
I have a list in my private apartments.
names and notes.
did my cousin Catherina send you?
you are not welcome here.
this is a dagger's tip upon which all events turn, Cardinal.
we are at the fork in the road.
Rome must not be allowed to take the wrong path here.
did you do this?
no.
it took us by surprise.
but it was our intention, at the proper moment.
preparations have been made for some time now, certain... matters arranged.
all this has done is move things along a little faster than we'd anticipated.
you have always known this day would come, Ascanio.
all that has changed is that now
I require your assistance in the matter.
by what right dare you require anything of me?
by right of blood. Of family.
of kinsmen.
and by right of what is good for Rome.
and if I refuse?
you should not refuse.
if he dies
when he dies.
what comes after?
are you here to dangle the Papacy of Rome in front of me like a carrot in front of a hungry mule?
are you saying you would refuse, if it were offered?
understand me clearly.
your cousin Catherina will not be denied this chance.
he will die.
all?
the whole brood of bastards die tonight.
so you should give thought to where you want to be come the dawn.
come home, Ascanio.
you have been too long away.
of course.
thank you.
you believe that one of you can beat him.
you can't.
Sforza knows too well your strengths and weaknesses, your little corridor politics.
he'll set you against one another, let you vie for position, and then take down the winner without breaking a sweat.
I can beat him
if you lend your strength to mine.
none of you wants to be pope in any case.
what you want is power.
and that I will give you, all that you could eat of it.
water! Dottore, water, now!
Yes, my lord!
your Holiness!
Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto.
Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper, et in saecula saeculorum.
Amen.
Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto.
your place is in the Vatican, Cardinal.
Rodrigo.
I...
don't try to speak.
your throat will be torn from the charcoal.
it's safe.
it's safe, it's safe.
I saw the face of death.
well, you're not dead, Father.
you live.
for how long?
a day and a night.
by who?
della Rovere.
the Dominicans were hiding him right here in Rome.
but we have him and I will know how many others, their names, their families...
he will tell everything before I'm done with him, and then he will beg for death.
they settled like crows around me...
I heard them...
...praying for my death.
they're gone now.
I have disappointed them.
how come I did not die?
you owe your life to Lucrezia.
and the grace of God.
Yes, and that.
no, not God.
where is he?
who, Father?
Juan. Where is Juan?
look at me.
look at me.
you have us.
we are here.
one day and a night.
so much has changed.
well?
what of my family?
make way!
they're well, so far.
and whether they remain so depends on your answer.
there are five guards inside the villa.
I don't know how many outside.
where placed?
the main doors. Two in the garden.
the others move around, upstairs mostly.
I'm not sure of more.
that's good enough.
and the family?
they will return when the pope is well.
or when he dies.
the window in the washing room leads outside?
when the family returns, leave the window unlatched and walk away.
but you must promise me
please, spare the child. He has done nothing.
of course.
you have my word.
no harm to the child.
let's go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah! That's it! Go!
hit him! Hit him!
peck his eyes out!
Yeah! Get him! Yeah, that's it!
call it off.
what's happened?
he's alive!
you're certain?
when I left he was calling for water.
by now he's probably fucking some servant girl with a wine jug in one hand and a swan's leg in the other.
it's over.
don't be a fool.
are you deaf? He's alive.
so make him die.
the others die tonight in any case.
I've already given the word.
dear God.
there's no backing down now.
within the month Rome will have a new pope.
better for all that it is a man of moderation and wisdom such as yourself.
you're insane.
he trusts you.
toledo steel.
it's one of a pair.
what have you done with the other?
I told you, preparations had been made.
in the pope's chamber.
concealed in the crucifix upon his offering table.
my father lives.
you've failed.
what say you to that?
today he lives.
one day he will not.
and on that day, where will you be?
you do know what awaits you, hmm?
what we did to Savonarola will seem like the merest whimsy compared to what I will inflict on you.
wait...
what I said, I meant.
give thought to it.
where will you be when he's gone?
they will tear you down like jackals.
I can help you.
I have no need of your help.
I can pave the way.
every word from your lips is a lie.
I'm beaten. I have failed.
I know that.
what use am I to you dead?
I do not mean for you to be dead.
not for a long, long time.
I saw the face of death.
I know. You said.
and I was afraid.
I am so afraid.
don't be.
it would take more than cantarella to fell an ox like you.
no, you don't understand.
I didn't see the face of God.
he was not there.
why did He not show Himself to me?
but I heard the others.
I heard them.
Colonna. Versucci.
deluca, Della Rovere.
how they prayed for my death, and swore to see me buried and never again a Spaniard on the papal throne.
carrion crows pecking away.
and where was God to protect me?
you must rest.
now close your eyes and sleep.
he frets, as if in fever.
you've done such work today.
take mother home. Stay with her.
take some sleep for tomorrow.
I'll stay with him.
look after him.
I heard that voice.
in the room, before the poison took hold and darkness dragged me down.
I heard you call out to me.
father, Father.
and you held me in your hands.
come here. Come.
there was something before the darkness.
something you said, something you told me...
...that the world must never know.
your brother's murder was a terrible crime, and every crime must be seen to have a punishment.
so we must find the person who is to be punished.
you understand?
and I?
you have to find your own peace.
forward!
Orsini: I will speak with the prisoner.
you are relieved. GUARDS: Yes, Your Eminence.
what is this? This is your freedom.
don't forget who put it in your hands.
but why?
others may succeed where you have not. [screaming, gasping]
and then, Rome will have need of you.
guard.
I will not forget this.
go with them. They will show you the way.
God be with you. And with you.
my Lord Cesare's orders.
no...
della Rovere! Find him!
follow me! Yes, my lord!
search everywhere!
you scared me.
what is it?
do you not hear the child crying?
look at me.
I said, look at me.
I had no choice.
della Rovere is free.
what?
there are dead men strewn through my father's house and Della Rovere is free.
all is well here?
no...
no, all is not well here.
just tell me.
there is a plot to kill your family.
it is my cousin Catherina Sforza's doing.
when?
tonight. Now.
get in there!
do not leave his side.
do not let anyone else in.
fuck!
your sister's bedroom.
they were warned.
Ascanio betrayed us.
then we will have to find another way.
that will be difficult.
they will be watching for assassination.
no.
no more assassination.
what then?
those they have dispossessed...
those they have made enemies of...
those upon whom they have trodden in their ascent to power...
let us gather them to us.
the cardinals?
no.
if our own cousin fails us, why look to the rest of the Consistory?
go to their families.
the young bloods, blades for hire.
second sons. Roberto and Paolo Orsini.
Vitelezzo Vitelli.
prospero Colonna.
Gian Paolo Baglioni.
the families of Bologna, Umbria, Siena.
an alliance.
you think they would fall in?
for the most part they hate each other.
they hate the Borgias more.
bring them to us.
marshal them under our banner.
and then let us see where we stand.
what's this?
this is murder.
man: Taken out of the Borgia palace, so we heard.
run through and through with swords.
seems there's treason afoot.
best you keep your eyes open.
were you in time?
Yes.
I thank God for it.
two men were sent in the night to wipe my family from the face of the earth and came within a blade's breadth of doing so.
the maid's family is dead.
the maid too, I'm sure, would have been disposed of had we not finished her first.
there is someone thinking far ahead, tying up loose ends.
who?
his name is Rufio.
he is a man of my cousin Catherina Sforza's household.
I have known him since he was a boy.
he's the most deadly, the most lethal
we will find him.
no, no, you will not.
he's not a mere assassin.
he has made himself a student of the art of death.
you will not find him unless he wishes it.
and so he found you.
he came to me and told me to choose my allegiance.
and you chose Rome.
Yes, of course I chose Rome!
what do you take me for? A traitor?
why should I be surprised at one more...
...when there are so many?
where is Della Rovere?
gone.
who knows where.
he had friends.
friends within the Vatican.
I knew nothing of this.
I knew nothing before tonight.
you did well enough.
they came our family
everyone is well.
who was it? Della Rovere?
perhaps.
more likely, this past night, your poisoning has rattled the grass and all the snakes in Rome have slid forth.
della Rovere may not be the worst of it.
well, then who? Who did it?
Catherina Sforza.
that bitch.
and you knew nothing of this until it was upon us?
who is to protect this family, if not you?
Rodrigo!
you are truly safe!
and little Giovanni?
he's safe. I told you, Father.
he's safe. We're all safe.
this night is done,
they settled like crows around me
praying for my death.
cardinal Orsini, Cardinal De Luca.
I came as soon as I heard.
my father lives. You failed.
where are these allies, Cesare?
who are our friends?
without him, what becomes of us?
you should go. It's not safe here.
I'm to be your husband.
Yes, but you're not yet.
I will send for you.
what is this? This is your freedom.
don't forget who put it in your hands.
guards!
did you do this? No.
all this has done is move things along a little faster than we'd anticipated.
now I require your assistance.
and if I refuse?
your cousin Catherina will not be denied this chance.
he will die. As will they all die.
all is well here? No.
there is a plot to kill your family.
when?
tonight. Now.
all the snakes in Rome have slid forth.
who is to protect this family if not you?
Ascanio betrayed us.
then we will have to find another way.
the cardinals?
no, their families.
they hate each other.
they hate the Borgias more.
open your eyes.
we're not safe.
we are at war.
della Rovere's escape was orchestrated by whom?
of that, I must plead ignorance.
we are in a snake pit, surrounded by venom and smiling vipers, and our son pleads ignorance?
maybe it was you, hm?
let me.
maybe you helped him to live to see another day.
the day perhaps when your beloved father breathes his last.
if you believe that, Father, then you have lost all faith in me.
we have lost faith in everyone, everything, even the hand that guides us.
surely not in your own family?
our family.
that...
bosom of trust and tranquillity.
no.
we feel safe in the arms of our family.
but as for that nest of vipers
called the College of Cardinals
we shall cleanse them.
purge it.
as we ourselves have been purged.
so, Brother, who called us here?
this letter.
unsigned.
it promised sport against the Borgia family.
and what if a Borgia wrote it?
too clever surely - even for them.
can you think of a better way to draw out their enemies?
who's there?
paulo Orsini - and Roberto.
when did you take to writing letters?
we didn't.
you were summoned too?
we were summoned here by the Orsini?
you were summoned by me.
and you are?
I am the black heart of a Borgia nightmare.
I speak with Catherina Sforza's voice and she invites you all to join her in a confederacy of hatred.
a hatred of the Sforza?
we all sign up to that.
and she would call you fool.
she would remind you of the days when families ruled this papacy of ours.
Roman families.
bury your enmities, bury them until the Borgia snake is lanced.
and she has the power to do that?
with your help.
and then, we can happily hate each other again.
she will drink to that.
think of Rome as a spider's web, my son.
each family has its silken thread attached to an egg that is planted within these walls.
and each one of those diaphanous threads go back through their families to the tarantula of Forli.
the great Arachne, Catherina Sforza.
and every egg wears a cardinal's hat and a smile of obedience and piety.
and plots to murder you, your mother, your sister.
and the plot to murder your beloved brother...
...succeeds.
unforgiveable, surely.
so if you are to gain our love again, we would have you trace those silken threads back to the families outside these walls.
and let us deal with the cardinals within.
and then I never saw her again.
we're being followed.
warn him off.
Yes, my lord.
you! Be wise and go home now.
I am never wise.
go!
my Lord Vitelli.
my Lord Borgia.
you are in quite the hurry.
we were accosted.
Rome is a lethal place at times like these.
who bears you a grudge?
I know not.
my whole family was assaulted.
and but for the actions of my brave manservant, my mother, sister, and nephew would lie like carrion in the streets.
Yes, I heard as much.
you also heard who set the dogs upon them?
no, I don't trust rumour.
Catherina Sforza, it is rumoured.
it is also rumoured that she had help.
from whom?
who covets the papal crown?
the great Roman families:
a dangerous accusation, my lord.
and one that would need evidence. Indeed.
Micheletto - call the night watch.
there was some unpleasantness in the streets.
and so I shall escort the good Lord Vitelli safely home.
no, no. It's no good. Come here.
it's no good!
my love...
it happens to every man once in a while.
not to me.
to every man.
why, have you known so many?
no. I'm sorry.
forgive me. Forgive me.
come here.
we have never been unmanned before.
maybe it's the poison.
I mean, we want you.
we desire you.
you are tired.
you've been through too much.
we have been tired before.
we have never been undone before.
perhaps it's age.
you are the most vigorous man I have ever known.
"was," perhaps.
you are. And this will pass.
believe me, it will pass.
cardinal Orsini!
you could hear a pin drop, Micheletto.
if I had a pin.
do you have a pin, Cardinal?
no, my Lord, I have no pin.
but you have relatives here.
could you introduce me to them?
the Lords Paulo, Roberto Orsini: Lord Cesare Borgia.
at your service.
may I join you?
be our guest.
you were here for the game, I would hazard.
the pope falls ill. The game begins.
who will succeed him? An Orsini?
a Colonna? A D'Este?
or, would anyone dare bet on another Spaniard?
but the pope lives. Indeed.
the game is over. For now.
so then why do you still linger here in Rome?
we like the ruins.
you prefer them to your castle in Bracciano? We like that too.
but you must confer with your cousin, the cardinal.
which is difficult in Bracciano. His business is in Rome.
Yes, he serves the pope, in Consistory.
does that service include the attempted assassination of his family?
be careful, my lord. I am - most careful.
I gutted those incompetent dogs.
sent by Catherina Sforza?
by you? Or by a great combination of both?
but the pope survived, thanks be to God.
here, take it down.
so, be careful with your calumnies and your accusations.
Rome is a city of rumour.
and you had a brother, who was murdered.
and rumour has it that the culprit still lives.
he has yet to be found.
well, perhaps he's here.
are you accusing me?
or me?
come father, come!
where we going? That's the mystery. Come!
Ooh! Come!
father!
hold on!
hold me, Father
promise you'll hold me!
I... I...
No! Father!
Cesare, Holy Father, your loving son.
our only son.
Catherina Sforza seeks out allies.
you've come to talk to us about spiders.
in an alliance against us - With whom?
all of them: the great Roman families.
so it is time to act.
to snip those silken threads from their source.
the great Arachne.
and to give her a lesson in the elegance of revenge.
can revenge be elegant? Oh, yes. And eloquent.
we shall begin with words.
an inquisition, within these walls.
they will all cry innocent.
we will have one interrogate the other.
interrogate.
and of what do we accuse them?
of a hand in the conspiracy.
to murder our sacred person, and of our family.
the murder of your beloved son.
you surpass yourself, Cesare.
I have a lot to atone for.
we shall start with he who is closest to the tarantula of Forli:
cardinal Sforza.
holiness, I swear by the living God that I am innocent in this matter.
I have long forsaken all ties with my family.
I am a nameless orphan, in the service of God, my pope, and the Borgia family.
you would rather be a Borgia than a Sforza?
in everything but name, I already am.
and you wish to prove to us your innocence?
your Holiness, I must.
then find for us those responsible.
who else then lies under suspicion? Everyone.
anybody who wears a red hat. Interrogate them all.
I am hardly an inquisitor. Then become one.
we will cleanse this Vatican of ours of anyone who even thinks to question our fitness for this most holy of offices.
is thought to be a crime now?
begin with De Luca.
threaten him with loss of office and banishment and
...he will sing madrigals.
and if he doesn't?
take him to the Castel Sant Angelo.
acquaint him with the instruments of torture.
you cannot torture a prince of the church.
I know that. You know that.
but imagination is a great persuader. He saw Savonarola burn.
he'll soon begin to sing - if he hasn't already
like a nightingale.
and then?
then - seize his estates, strip his red hat.
banish him to some hermitage.
and arrest all those he has implicated.
and start the process again.
we are in a new world, Cardinal.
you were married before. Indeed, my love.
the whole world knows that.
and yet this child is not your husband's.
true.
the whole world knows that too.
if we are to be married, and happily my love, we must have no secrets.
then I have a confession to make to you, Lucrezia Borgia.
I'm listening.
I saved myself for marriage.
Ah! Thank God.
so you are all mine.
you misunderstand me. I am that most un-Italian thing.
a virgin.
well, we can soon put that to rights.
I made a vow to Saint Agnes.
the patron saint of purity.
the first woman that I'd lie with would be my wife.
well lie with me.
I will be your wife.
Yes, but you are not yet.
we must wait then.
Yes, we must wait.
and until that night, all this beauty will be just a promise.
perhaps the poison is still within you.
perhaps it strikes at the root of you.
the doctor said that the poison is gone. Perhaps it's God's punishment:
your lack of vigour.
or maybe His blessing.
in the past we have striven to subdue our passions.
maybe now we can succeed.
how can we love when the very air we breathe is poisoned with venom and hatred?
and trust no one - but you?
and we could not protect you when the assassins struck.
you can't blame yourself for that. We are God's minister on Earth;
he has abandoned us.
if we cannot keep you safe, we would rather give up our calling.
life without the papacy; what a thought.
but how would you spend your days?
tending your vines?
Yes! Oh!
we would sit together in the garden in the evening and watch our grandchildren grow.
a garden? We'd have a garden?
Mm. Flowers, a beehive
beehive. A soft spring well. Then we would find peace.
with all that we have, all the trappings of office and power, we cannot protect you, our family.
we would rather be a peasant in a garden with a pitchfork
if that would keep you safe.
cardinal De Luca.
I would speak with you.
he heard every word, the Holy Father.
every word, every plot, every insinuation.
he must know what happens on the illness of a pope.
he plotted so himself. This is not just any ordinary pope.
this is a pope whose son has been murdered and whose family almost died at the same blade.
he will take action. So tell me, what must I do?
first, you must confess. Well, I admit it then.
I am guilty. Of what?
of avarice - for advancement.
for, dare I say, the throne of St. Peter.
well, that may not be enough.
am I guilty of more?
who murdered the son?
the world awaits news on that.
there was a plot led by Catherina Sforza and Della Rovere to rid the earth of the Borgia family.
the plotters are in the Vatican walls.
I am a cleric, Cardinal.
I am adept at strategy; perhaps arranging votes on conclave, on committee.
as to my expertise in murder,
I would plead incompetence.
you are the cousin to Catherina Sforza.
the finger of such an accusation must surely fall on you.
indeed it does.
which may well explain my sense of urgency in this matter.
when the Holy Father was ill, he heard no words of mine.
and what are my options?
confession.
to a crime I would never even dream of committing?
then name those who would. The plotters.
and who are they?
Orsini, Versucci, Colonna. Pick who you will.
it doesn't matter. They all wanted him dead.
I could never.
Yes, I know; the very thought seems outrageous.
but we must learn how outrage becomes normality.
this Vatican of ours has changed...
...forever.
follow me.
follow you where?
into the future.
am I, a prince of the church, to be to put to the rack?
the very thought appalls me. But there are others less delicate than I.
so perhaps these instruments of torture may act as an aid to contemplation.
cardinal Sforza, Cardinal Sforza,
cardinal Sforza, please!
please, Cardinal Sforza!
please, Cardinal Sforza!
cardinal Sforza! Sforza!
No! Sforza!
may I enter?
will modesty allow it?
please.
little Giovanni.
he's a virgin.
he will punish me cruelly.
he will make me wait.
I have had word from my uncle,
king Ferdinand of Naples.
observe.
the sleep of the innocent.
you have come to kiss him good night?
or to kiss me?
my uncle's letter mentioned him: the child.
the child?
neither mine nor your husband's.
what of it?
my uncle has expressed his disquiet at the thought of...
the thought of?
the thought of a child without legitimacy in the palace of Naples.
well, you and your uncle will have to agree to disagree then.
of course.
you would never - Who negotiates your dowry?
my brother.
well, then I must go to him and insist that
perhaps I should broach the matter with him.
you?
my brother's passions can be intense where issues of family are concerned.
why have you forsaken me?
why have you forsaken me?
you are in the house of lies.
the devil's house?
think of them as your friends.
the rack? The iron maiden?
they have a message for you.
you have used them, I am sure. I have suffered on them.
your inquisitor believes that they elicit the truth.
they do not.
a man will say anything on the rack to make it end.
then why am I here?
to learn to lie. To say whatever is needed.
to avoid their embrace.
you are to negotiate my dowry, Brother.
with his uncle.
the King of Naples; yes.
so must I trade one love for another?
leave us. My lord.
do you mean me for him?
that too.
what do you mean?
I mean my son, Giovanni.
his presence in Naples might be unwelcome.
I could have seen that coming.
the King of Naples feels that one cannot carry into one marriage baggage from the last. Is your son baggage to you?
no.
he's the light of my life.
well, you could insist. I will, as must you.
but you must make the case for the son of a stable boy in a royal household.
listen.
you are Lucrezia Borgia.
you are the scandal of Italy.
you are also the envy of Italy.
and soon to be a princess of Aragon.
whoever gets in the way of your happiness will meet my wrath.
we are the unholy family.
let him know that.
I fear he knows already.
he will love you, he will serve you, and if Naples dares to take your son from you,
I promise... it will never know peace again.
can I get help, please?
help now! Yes, my lord!
did you sleep?
but I dreamed, Cardinal.
you dreamt without sleeping?
now that is miraculous.
call it a waking dream.
tell me.
I dreamed of a vast conspiracy encircling our beloved Vatican.
it has its roots in the hills of the Romagna, in the great families that would claim St. Peter's as their own.
and its tendrils spread like writhing serpents through the streets of Rome, breaking inside the Vatican walls...
where it becomes a many-headed hydra and each head wears a cardinal's hat.
why don't you tell me more?
Lucrezia? Is that my brother?
Yes.
the brother who loves me? The same.
come in then. See my wedding gown.
God, um - Come closer, Brother.
my gown. Do you approve?
the gold is um... divine.
I - I should leave, Sis - Why?
am I ugly, Brother?
the man who makes that claim will lose his tongue.
my foot.
it is ungainly?
too large, perhaps? Your foot is beautiful.
you can't tell from there.
feel it.
is this a game?
it is a game of want and wanting.
the toes are splayed a little.
God has made better feet, I'm sure. Not that I have found.
you are a connoisseur of feet.
Yes. And I have found none better.
my calf.
is it elegant?
is it smooth?
what is this game, Sis?
my betrothed will not bed me.
he will not touch me. He is a virgin.
you have the means to change that history, I'm sure.
are you sure?
that this body has the necessary charms?
I am certain.
he has made a vow to St. Agnes, the patron saint of purity
to remain chaste until married.
unwise.
I am a Borgia.
and I feel unloved.
positively foolish.
you look but don't touch.
my lady.
my lady, your fitting.
that will be the dressmakers to fit my wedding dress.
you must leave us, Brother. Yes...
for delicacy's sake.
Yes, of course.
come in!
there was a conspiracy, Holy Father, devised by the mistress of Forli, Catherina Sforza.
but it is a conspiracy so vast that we have no doubt that she had help.
from within these walls?
indeed.
and have no doubt, Holy Father, that he that denies such a conspiracy existed was part of the conspiracy himself.
we had feared as much.
a vast many-headed hydra, spreading from the families of the Romagna and each head wears a cardinal's hat.
the end was plain:
the murder of you and your entire family.
in the instance of your most sacred person, it almost succeeded.
in the instance of your beloved son, Juan Borgia, it succeeded only too well.
and the conspirators?
are they amongst us here?
they are, Holy Father.
and most shamefully, I must count myself amongst their number.
your honesty is noted.
but you must name names, Cardinal.
cardinal Francesco Todeschini Piccolomini.
liar!
accuse yourself, De Luca and that perfidious Orsini!
cardinal Giovanni Battista Orsini.
these are false accusations coming from Cardinal Rocca Colonna.
I have been party to no conspiracy, Your Holiness!
those cardinals, those who have betrayed our sacred trust
will be stripped of their offices and titles, their properties confiscated and returned to our Holy Mother Church.
they will be forbidden entry through the gates of Rome, and live under censure for the rest of their days.
is this why you would speak with me?
I who was once you.
you who will become me.
should I resign myself?
to being a mistress discarded?
I should be hating you, not providing a sympathetic ear.
advise me then.
is there another?
not that I know. Perhaps it is you, then.
something has changed between us.
I have felt it for some time.
does he still love you?
I hope.
perhaps you'll find, as I have that...
love deepens, regardless of whether you share the same bed.
you mean I may find it is truly over between us?
perhaps.
then you must state your terms.
negotiate your exit.
what would you have from him, if not his passion?
a palace like yours.
that's easy. The cardinals are falling like flies.
and...
a cardinal's hat.
for you? Have you no shame?
for my brother.
do you think she'd be happy here?
so she's to be banished from your life then?
no.
but a little distance might be beneficial between us.
have you told her that?
I did mention it.
And?
she was upset, but the tears didn't last long.
I mean, I think she was...
relieved, maybe, to be released from us.
everything has its end.
whose palace was this?
one of the cardinals who betrayed me.
it'll take more than a palace to keep her happy.
have you spoken to her?
she told me that your vigour had somewhat diminished.
I told her I couldn't imagine such a thing.
as I said before, it's a blessing in disguise.
why do you laugh?
because my life without you has turned out to be another blessing in disguise.
we are both blessed then.
together we're cursed.
but apart, at least I'm at peace.
my God, what a bed.
it would fit the whole Consistory.
perhaps it did.
what? This is a rare pleasure.
alone together.
we find ourselves becoming a little agitated.
you should call the guard.
we lack the voice.
little goat.
it's been a long time since you called me that.
well, every now and then I whisper it.
but rarely.
ah no, no, no, no, no.
you lack the vigour, remember?
it would appear no longer.
so the cause was not the poison, my love.
it would appear not.
you know...
we feel safe with you.
as if we've come home.
these offices I relinquish willingly.
these estates I place in the care of our Holy Mother Church.
this hat...
I now return to the hands that blessed me with it.
in nomine Patris et Fillii et Spiritus Sancti.
Amen.
but I would ask one last blessing before I leave our beloved Vatican forever.
confession.
I would confess to the pope's ear alone, and be absolved of my heinous sins by the successor to St. Peter.
now? Yes.
this is most irregular.
the business of defrocking alone will take hours...
your Holiness, I have been asked to effect my retirement with maximum and unseemly haste.
I have complied.
if my request is granted, I will be gone forever.
you need never set eyes on me again.
well... Please...
please.
we grant this blessing.
No!
with the utmost efficacy.
cardinal Sforza, take our place.
bless me, Your Holiness, for I have sinned.
and my sins are many.
but the greatest of them...
is this murder. Murder?
I must protest against this outrage!
this hat is red as a symbol of our willingness to spill our blood in defence of our Holy Mother Church!
whose murder?
a murder yet... to be committed!
for which the whole world will grant me forgiveness!
and I return it willingly since there is nothing of value
no residue of honour, of goodness, of sanctity left to defend!
there will be rejoicing in the Heavens as Hell welcomes you with open arms...
may it lie in the filth which will be its deserved home!
I'll gladly die with you.
as you sink into the darkness
call out His name, see if He replies.
or if you must hear the eternal silence.
next!
cardinal Colonna!
this is one endless confession.
close the door.
God must want us to live.
get up.
what?
you fell asleep again.
just 5 more minutes, please.
no... Get up.
Hey.
late night?
I guess. - Again?
again. - Hm, same guy?
no. - Do I know him?
maybe.
does he know me?
good morning everyone.
good morning. - Good morning.
talk to me, Lawrence, what we have for specials?
lobster in white wine sauce. - Mh'hm.
what else? - Spinach and almonds.
Linguini in a tomato sauce.
that looks good.
more than 25 no-sugar for Marshalls wedding?
welcome back, Mr. and Mrs. Dunning.
so nice to see you again. - Nice to see you too.
you remember Sophie?
she'll escort you to your usual table, have a lovely meal.
follow me.
Sylvie, table six needs help with wine.
alright, thank you.
good afternoon. - Hi.
huh... Vivian just told me you need a wine recommendation.
Yeah, we're having the "Petite Filet."
um...
I would... highly recommend the 87 "Castle Chateau."
it's a beautiful Bordeaux. - Hm...
no, I haven't heard of it.
it's not on our list...
we have it on special reserve down in the cellar...
I think you really would enjoy it.
why, thank you, that would be fantastic.
be right back.
um, table 18 wanted their checks. - Okay.
what's the matter? Excuse yourself...
and get Vivian to do it. - You Sure?
going out for a quick cigarette, alright?
okay.
that was great suggestion, that "Chateau Castle."
it's one of my favorite.
Yeah, what other kind would you recommend?
that'd be depending on the meal.
well, if that's okay to figure that out, tonight over dinner?
I don't socialise with customers.
this is where my father and that fucking slut burned.
how the fire start?
the cops said they left the gas on and it exploded.
so, it was an accident?
yeah... That's what the Sheriff said.
so, he was fucking when he died.
their bodies still stuck together because of the fire?
I had use a knife to cut them apart.
and who was the bitch?
some weird woman, from I don't know.
here's where they met.
catholic Pinko town.
now, what're you doing?
I think this was going, after dads head was burning.
why'd you bring, Xavier?
because he's my friend.
you bury your dad tomorrow you're running a circus.
I'm running a circus, bitch.
fuck you.
Hi, mama, aunt, Rebecca...
did you fight with Cristobal?
no.
because, I don't wanna hear anyone fighting.
now more than ever.
okay.
that's my dad's whiskey.
is it?
when the hell is he gonna drink it?
Santiago?
excuse me, father. - Cristobal.
your mom ain't going to the funeral.
neither Rebecca and me ain't going either.
this son of bitch doesn't deserve this funeral today, damn.
take care of everything, the both of you.
protecting us from evil.
for thing is the kingdom in Heaven...
forever and ever.
Amen.
in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
Amen. - Amen.
who are they?
I don't know.
and now we bid farewell, of our brother, Nick Martinez.
I hope your father's rotting in hell.
that wetback piece of shit took away the best thing I ever had.
Hey! Leave the boys alone.
alone?
it's their father's fault that my kids lost their mom.
and I hope you rot too.
what's the location?
there's a job over in the Free Azt calcium area.
anybody interested? - Good.
how much does the job pay?
how much do you pay? 50 pesos.
it's 80 acres. - Good, I'll do it.
the plane's ready to take off.
one, two, three, four, five...
Maria, come on!
I'm coming.
Maria, let's go!
Maria, stop playing and do what your papa tells you.
see you later.

Hey, Daddy, what up?
Hey, honey, we have a job.

Hi.
Hi.

I never been there.
but he tells me, it's far from everything.

it isn't the Hilton.
I want cereal, Mariana.
I wanted mine over easy.
well, that's too bad, eat these because I got 'em all done.
Hey, Mariana, what's for dinner?
you can fix you and your friends some cereals.
Hi, all.
the supermarket was packed.
the lines were wrapped around the isles.
did your daddy call?
Yeah, he said he's gonna be back day after tomorrow.
he's making a delivery to Abilene.
that's okay.
I'll do it.
Hey.
Hey, guess what?
senator Parks office just called.
he's coming in today for lunch with a party of eight.
shit! He couldn't call a day ahead?
Lawrence?
senator's party is coming in in 2 hours, they want the usual.
two hours? Was he expecting to get everything?
I'm gonna call Forresters fish market see what they got.

you promised never to ask any questions.
who the fuck with?
I have work to do.
I'll be right back with another bottle, you all enjoy your meal.
why is the Senators wine glass empty?
Sylvie, I'm sorry.
the Senator seemed pleased.
I'll say. He left a 500 dollar tip.
I think he wants us to vote for him in this next election.
you're unbelievable. - No, I'm not.
that's what I want for Christmas next year.
remember that.
have fun.
Sylvie! Who the hell's this guy?
Jesus Christ, John, don't do this right this minute,
it's just a friend, okay?
he's a costumer, I saw him having lunch here yesterday.
Yeah, yesterday.
Hey, wait. Just...
fuck whoever you wanna fuck... and that's it?
when you leave your wife... then you can talk.
let's go.
Jesus Christ. - I wanna talk to you.
unlock your door. - Hey.
come on! Talk to me! - Hey, come on, leave her alone.
fuck off.
Sylvie! - What?
what's your problem? - I wanna talk to you.
my friend, leave her alone. - I told you to fuck off.
Hey! - John. John!
Jesus Christ! What're you? Seven?
What're you doing? - I wanna talk to you.
Ah, this is bull-shit.
I leave you to figure this shit out with your boy-friend.
he's not my boy-friend. - Why'd you do this?
don't touch me.
give me five minutes.
What'd you think? Just keep fucking following me!
Hey, Sylvia. - You don't own me, John.
do me a favor and fuck off.
I'll... Let me take you home.
you okay? - What'd you want?
you okay? You okay?
I don't understand you.
Hey, hey! I take you home.

I take you home?

Sylvie.
Sylvie?

I'm not here to fight.

I just wanna know more, that's all.

okay, I'll come look for you then.
daddy!
daddy!
daddy!
Hey.
Hey, darling.
I thought you didn't get back until tomorrow.
Yeah, but I rapped up early. - Hm'hm.
Where're the kids?
they went to a baseball game.
you wanna wait and have lunch with them?
Yeah.
I'll get cleaned up.
here, hon. - Thanks, babe.
the tank's working in no time.

Yeah.

do you know my mom?
when I first met your dad, your mom already was gone.
why did she leave?
I have no idea.
your dad, looked for her for a long time...
and thinks it's his fault, why she left.
I'don't really wanna meet her. - Don't start that again, please.
your dad ask me, to have you meet her...
and her to meet you.
Hi.

look at this place.
you make me so happy.
Hmm...
well, I'd be even happier...
if we could have some hot water so I can take a shower.
you know... You taste better this way.
no... No, please.

Why?
because I don't like that part of my body.
how'd you know I wasn't gonna like it?
I had cancer... two years ago.
Hey.

I can't keep seeing you.
I'm gonna wait for you at the trailer, every day at noon.

Hi, Mom. - Hey...
I gotta surprise. - What's this?

Oh, come on, don't you wanna roast some marshmallows?
I'm not a kid, mom.
Mariana, how about you? Just for a little bit?
I have to go to Kate's house, to study for a school project.
Bye, daddy. - Bye, sweetie.
I can't.
I just can't.
I'm sorry.
you may wanna brush up on the worst traffic light lamp...
coming!
Hey.

they haven't been here either.
I think we should check the Palms.
if we don't find them here. They're gone.
believe me, a Mexican with a 12 year old girl are pretty hard to hide.
we'll find them.
we just keep looking.
when was the last time you saw her?
I lost her two days after she was born.
Why?
I didn't deserve her.
teachers must really like you.
Hey, hon. - Hey.
there's somebody here to see you.
Hi.
Hey, you never told us about Mariana.

Hey.

can I sit down?
I'm very sorry, I ran away like that yesterday.
I didn't...
it just...
Maria, do you speak English?
you're all grownup.
I think about you all the time.
especially on your birthdays.
try to imagine what you look like.
you're so beautiful.
you know, you look just like your father.
my dad's in the hospital.
Why?
his plane crashed.
is he okay?
I don't know.
he's a pilot.
he's a crop duster.
you don't know?
is everything okay?
your dad would like her to come to Mexico, we could take with us.
you think she'll come?
dear Lord, take care of us and everyone else. Amen.
okay... now bed.
have you said your prayers?
I don't pray anymore.
that's wrong, Mariana.
lots things are wrong, mom, which can't be fixed by praying.
you've been acting so strange lately.
tomorrow I want you to tell me what's on your mind.
good night, sweetie.
good night, mom.
good night.
that girl who brought home the other day...
is her daughter?
Yes, sir.
are you fucking her?
why you doing this?
it's none of your business.
you can't be doing this shit to your mom.
stay outta this.
it's not enough what already happened?
it got nothing to do with this.
you gotta stop seeing her.
you understand?
do you... understand?
you enjoy betraying your family?
I'm talking to you, you son of bitch!
I'm not betraying anyone. - You're worse than your father.
you get to bring her home?
you're gonna be burned in hell with him.
I'm sorry.
get outta here!
what happened?
tell me it isn't true.
look at this.
tell me this is a lie.
did you actually sleep with him?
santiago, my dad is on his way to get you.
go down, and come get me.
what grade are you in?
the eighth grade.
do you have a boy-friend?
no.
do you?
I don't have a boy-friend.
jose Sanchez Martinez.
I wanna have the plastic surgery and a new breast.
don't do it... I like how you look.
the scar is so ugly.
you beat death.
you fought and won.
that makes your scar beautiful.
don't erase it.
get up, mom...
get up, mom... Get up, mom. Get up!
mom!
how's he doing, Doctor?
can the girl stay and listen? It's her dad.
there are some complications.
his leg is badly infected...
if the medicine won't help to clear it up...
we'll have to operate and amputate his leg.
can we go see him?
you can go and see him, but he's sedated.
Hi, daddy.
no, girl, not so close.
he's gonna be okay, right?
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.
I... I love you, daddy.
don't...
you can't stay here. You have to go.
let's go.
Maria, come on...
we have to leave, okay?
come on.
wait! Can I...
can I just stay a little longer?
I don't know, what she's saying.
it's his wife, she'd like to stay a little longer.
two minutes.
Santiago...
it's me...
Mariana.
you're not ready to die, are you?
because if you die, I wouldn't know what to do with her, and...
I can barely look her in the eyes.
she needs you.
and I need you.
I'm so scared.
I always was able to take care of myself and now I can't...
I can't run away anymore.
I killed them.
I killed your father and my mother.
I didn't mean to, but...
now I can't get... away from that smell...
from them burning, I can't get rid of it.
why did you wanted me to come back here?
Why?
Why?
Mariana, where're you going?
Mariana, stop! - Let me go!
I will tell dad.
tell 'em whatever you want.
Hey, Maria, you can sleep in your room, I'll sleep out here.
no, it's okay.
what happened?
nothing, I just burned myself once.
you know dad has the same scar in the same place.
he said he did it to never forget you.
so did I.
I have a scar too.
how that happened?
I fell when I was three.
are you gonna stay with us?
I do not know, I have to talk to him.
it's been a long time.
you're leaving then, aren't you?
I'm tired.
good night.
good night.
where are we?
that's Mexico.
What're we gonna do over there?
live in peace.
I'll never have peace again.
I'm pregnant.
what?
I'm pregnant and I don't want it.
we can go to Mexico to live. The three of us.
no, I can't. I can't have it.
can I talk to you a minute?
Maria...
you ever think you can forgive me for not...
for not being here all these years?
I left you because I was scared that you'd be like me.
that you'd come out like me.
you think you can forgive me?
please...
I'm going to go see my dad now.
hello. - Hello, Doctor.
how is he?
he's fine, we were able to drain the infection, reset the bones...
and put his leg in a cast. - He's not losing his leg?
no, he's not losing his leg.
we'll keep him under observation, for now everything looks good.
can I see him?
Yes, you can go and see him.
my dad's gonna be okay.
are you coming?
thank you for the horse.
you liked him?
Oh, it's beautiful...
but I thought we were going sailing today.
you promised.
well, that one's too old.
see, now? That'll do.
come on!
come on, Mr. E.
it's broken. -Who says?
now, Edward, we agreed.
no more Mokelock.
Mokelock is the bogeyman.
Mokelock wants me where I am.
we can fix it.
sing a song of sixpence.
sing a song of sixpence.
a pocket full of rye.
four and twenty blackbirds.
baked in a pie.
rise and shine.
Mr. E is doing fine.
did we go sailing?
almost.
Mokelock showed up.
Mokelock is the bogeyman.
Mokelock wants me where I am.
Mokelock is a pain in the ass.
Where'd he get Mokelock again?
mother Goose.
what's the matter, Barry?
Edward's parents are here.
he needs a haircut.
he loves it when you visit.
my husband wonders if that's true.
he wants to place Edward in the hospital.
I'm sorry, Catherine.
Mr. Baines...
I've been working on this project for seven years.
I know, Henry. I know.
please don't take offense, Dr. Kent.
your work's invaluable to this company.
but you're not sure about me.
we've waited eighteen months for signs of progress.
there has been progress.
there's no proof, Catherine.
with all due respect, Mr. Baines...
I'm not the one who designed the procedure.
I mean, I wish I could take credit for it, but I can't.
I was chosen to do a job. They picked me.
but if you think there's someone better...
or someone who's more devoted to your son, then
no one's doubting your ability, Catherine.
what is it, then?
there's no proof, Catherine.
there's no proof the procedure works.
all you're giving me is the belief...
that your interaction with my son...
is not a...
hallucination.
shit!
I better get back to work.
Oh, good-bye, Mrs. Baines.
thank you. -Thank you, Mr. Baines.
come, shall we? Lucien.
lucky she worships you.
Why? Because he hates me?
I wouldn't say "hates.
Distrusts, dislikes immensely...
can't bear the sight of.
what's the verdict?
well, we've got another six months...
and Barry had to push for that.
I want to reverse the feed, Miriam...
now more than ever.
we've been through this a hundred times, Catherine.
it's too risky.
why not? What do we have to lose?
when I did social work, it was always better...
when we took the kids out of their environment.
foster homes can be scary at first...
but eventually they see that things can be different.
edward is like that right now.
He--he's living in a world that is not healthy.
let's show him a different place.
all right. Let's say we do it your way.
we reverse the feed, and we bring Edward into your mind.
can you imagine his shock when he finds...
that he's been thrust into this whole other world?
I do it all the time. -You're a willing participant.
you're aware of what's happening.
Edward's in a coma.
and besides, we don't know what effect it will have on you.
I mean, you're already exhausted.
have you been sleeping? -Yes.
any more nightmares? -No.
no. -Good.
leave work here.
don't take it home in this.
Hey, you.
what are you looking for, hmm?
want some milk?
that's fun. Let me try it.
not so much power. The animal is delicate.
Edward, is that you?
Edward, were there seagulls being killed on the beach...
while you were sailing?
don't hide, sweetie, please? Edward, is that you?
don't be afraid.
no one will hurt you.
Edward, is that you?
go to sleep.
help!
somebody, help me, please!
somebody!
help me!
can you hear me?
help!
thanks for waiting, Cole.
Teddy Lee, no problem.
special Agent Ramsey.
Cole. -Morning.
who found her?
the surveyorfor the railroad, about 6: 00 this morning.
Skidmarks appear to match the tire tracks from Reno.
and it looks like he scraped the rail and lost some paint.
it's on its way to the lab already.
dumped the body over there.
bleach.
she makes seven.
jeez, this stinks.
do they all look like dolls?
every unfortunate soul.
what's that?
some kind of a collar. part of his methodology.
the way he puts it there?
he makes it for them.
it makes him feel they belong to him.
is the water always this low?
Yeah, this time of year.
give me a coroner's report right away.
preliminary forensics, too.
I don't want anyone dragging their ass on this.
so, how was work?
Oh, exhausting.
I have no idea, Jean. For God's sake.
good luck with the monster. I love you, too. I gotta go.
OK. Thanks. Bye. -All right. Bye-bye.
hot off the presses.
there's nothing new to report, gentlemen.
a match on his semen.
water in her lungs...
show high levels of chlorine and rust.
what, pray tell, is this?
they say they found some dog hair?
from a canine unit?
no. There was no canine unit.
and Anne Vicksey doesn't own a dog, Teddy.
I want to see this.
what you got, Teddy?
Hypomelanosis.
and that means?
a complete absence of melanin.
the dog is an albino.
he'd love an animal like that.
gentlemen...
I believe an albino dog is a rare animal indeed.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
you poor boy.
you're gonna be OK.
baby, I'm so sorry.
Jesus Christ, Peter.
thought you were gonna get some sleep, clean yourself up.
I did.
they're waiting, you know. -I'm ready.
let's go.
we're gonna do this two ways.
breeders of German shepherds.
ford dealers.
I want you to be thorough, and I also want you to be fast.
this guy's accelerating.
he only waited six days this time.
when he first started, months could pass.
and that means one of two different things.
one, he thinks we're stupid, and we can't catch him.
two, which is the one that I believe...
he wants to be caught.
the dog hair thing is sloppy.
he leaves Anne Marie Vicksey in three inches of water.
he knew that we'd find her.
now, there's one thing I know for certain.
if we can't stop him...
he ain't gonna stop himself.
will this be all right?
Yes, ma'am, that's great. Thank you very much.
she was still living at home, ma'am?
we were looking through apartments.
but they're not moving in together...
until after the wedding.
Julia wants to be married.
did she ever mention anything out of the ordinary?
for instance, somebody she was seeing mad...
or somebody perhaps watching her or following her?
pardon me.
what if you made a mistake?
maybe this isn't the man.
maybe Julia's safe.
there's certain things that he does...
that make us pretty positive that this is the man.
last year, I lost my husband to cancer.
I went through such terrible pain.
but Julia, she was always there for me.
what's going on, Gordon?
riverside sheriff found a dog breeder in Woodcrest.
three years ago, she had a buyer...
for an albino shepherd pup.
sheriff checks D. M.V.
son of a bitch drives a '92 ford pickup.
guess what color. -Aquamarine.
Novak! -Where is it?
edison, just east of Loma park.
s. W.A. T.'s had the house under surveillance...
for about twenty minutes.
Carl Rudolph Stargher.
no registered weapons, no priors.
got a license for his dog, though.
named him Valentine.
you're the bad man, aren't you, Carl?
Mairzy doats and dozy doats
and liddle lamzy divey
a kiddley divey, too
wouldn't you?
Brock, Agent Ramsey, Agent Novak.
we got here as fast as we could. I briefed them on the way over.
where do we stand?
here's the situation.
we got a high-ground team on the roof...
a four-man element to the east.
we got an entry team in the van across from the house...
a two man element to the south.
have you seen him yet?
no. There's been some movement in the kitchen.
can't tell what it is.
you think the girl's in there? -We'll assume she is.
FBl! -Go!
freeze, motherfucker!
I got the dog!
clear. -Clear.
they'll take him to County General.
Reid's already there.
make sure he stays cuffed.
I want two men on him at all times.
I don't want anyone to treat him but Reid.
not so much as a thermometer up his ass, understand?
she's not here.
you should come downstairs.
mommy!
please take care of my little baby!
please, are you there? Hello?
please hear me.
can you hear me?
I need something.
I need you...
anybody here?
this is not happening to me.
this is definitely not happening.
please help!
have you ever heard of Whelan's infraction?
it's a form of schizophrenia.
it's very rare, and it's very severe.
in any schizophrenic...
these areas would be affected...
but in someone with Whelan's...
they're hit hard, and they're hit fast.
can't you load him up with thorazine or doxepin?
normal psychotropics don't work.
this thing is caused by a virus...
that infects the neurological system in utero.
it lays dormant...
until it's triggered by some kind of trauma.
most likely, he's exhibited symptoms for some time...
but the infraction, or the breach...
didn't occur until today.
the triggers can vary.
uh, usually water-related, but the results don't vary.
he's not just catatonic.
he's disappeared
Iike having a dream and never waking up.
for how long?
Oh, forever.
Lee, I think we might be missing the bigger picture here.
now, whatever state that he happens to be in...
there is a girl that is missing...
and her name is Julia Hickson...
and he is the only one that knows where she is.
he keeps them in this thing...
for about forty hours.
now, he took Julia Hickson at 7: 30 last night.
Peter, you know me.
if there were anything, anything...
what?
he provides them with food...
drinking water, and a toilet.
now, she thinks she's been kidnapped...
that there's a chance of survival...
but it's just a form of torture.
this is a kind of ritual for him
a cleansing before he takes them home...
and turns them into a doll, a toy.
now, this thing is fully automated...
and unless we find her by tonight...
this will happen to her.
at the request of Mr. Cooperman...
we've contacted your board of directors...
and they've given their approval.
and so have Edward's parents.
but the decision is yours.
it's up to Catherine.
she's the one who would have to face...
whatever risks there might be...
so, I support whatever decision she makes.
can I ask you something?
please.
if he wasn't like this...
if he was conscious...
do you think that he would tell you where she is?
there's always a chance of a confession. Yeah.
and there's things he's done that show a need for disclosure.
he hasn't had a sympathetic ear.
he wants someone to listen, to try and understand him.
look, I feel for this girl, I do...
but Stargher may no longer know the truth.
for severe schizophrenics...
there's no discerning between fantasy and reality.
is it possible?
if he came to trust me, yes...
but it takes months to earn that kind of trust.
is it possible?
daddy?
come here...
and save me! Save me!
I'm daddy's girl.
his levels are too flat.
what happened here?
we removed fourteen steel rings.
should have left him the way he was.
he used to suspend himself, didn't he?
they're comforted by the feeling of weightlessness...
Iike floating in water.
now, this, gentlemen, is the catalyst.
the neurological connectic transfer system...
not only maps the mind...
it sends the signal to another party.
all you need to do is tune in...
but you do much more than tune in.
you become part of the show.
he's ready.
why are there three stations?
for a while, we tried joint therapy sessions
two shrinks for the price of one
but Edward hated it and only talked to Catherine.
she has a gift.
are you sure?
I'm sure.
response signal...
functioning.
we implanted a touch-sensitive microchip in her hand...
so if she wants to stop the session...
or if it gets too intense, she can give the signal...
and we abort.
when we were ready for practical testing...
Miriam and I auditioned...
some of the best child therapists in the country.
and all they did was observe and report, nothing more.
Catherine was the least experienced...
but she came so highly recommended...
that we decided, what the hell, we'll give her a shot...
and immediately, we could tell she was different.
you're not human. You don't lie in my house.
you're an animal!
Hey, you.
Yeah, you like that, don't you?
is your name Carl?
you know, I know another little boy with a horse.
his name's Edward.
I mean the boy, not the horse.
what's wrong?
his victims.
where you come from?
gentlemen, she's back.
I'll be right there.
all right. Come on, Catherine.
she's had quite a journey.
unlike anything we've ever seen before.
so she's made contact? -Oh, yes.
she's gone very deep into his world.
at times too far.
it's cold.
that can be dangerous.
what are you talking about?
well, if she came to believe that Stargher's world is real...
then theoretically, her mind could convince her body...
that anything that was done to it there...
is actually done.
it's like the old wives' tale where you die in your dream...
you die in real life.
Henry, could you raise the temperature in here, please?
Dr. Kent? -Just a moment, please.
Dr. Kent, can I come in there and speak with you?
we have to be patient.
I mean, look at her. She's drowsy.
let her wake up.
we don't have a lot of time. Do you understand that?
our father, who art in heaven...
hallowed be thy name.
am I interrupting anything?
is it OK if l...
he knows you're here, doesn't he?
my friend Dr. Reid said...
that it's very unusual
schizophrenia, that is
in a child that's this young.
they usually think it's autism.
what you have to understand...
is there's nothing wrong with his body.
what's paralyzed is a part of his mind.
it's so damaged by the virus...
he can't even will himself to move.
you think you can change that?
do you believe there's a part of yourself...
that you don't show anybody?
I think everybody has that side of themselves.
during a session, when I'm inside...
I get to see those things.
I feel them.
with Stargher, I felt things I never want to feel again.
he's not even Carl Stargher anymore.
he's this idealized version of himself
a king in a very, very twisted kingdom.
the place for him to indulge every...
you know, I don't want to talk about this in here.
I could never do what you do
devote myself to understanding a mind like that.
I don't think we'll ever be able to understand a mind like that.
but you try. That's your job.
I guess so.
you don't like what you do?
I like it better than my old job.
used to be an attorney. I was a prosecutor.
what happened?
I had a case, um...
where this little girl was molested.
and because of this one tiny piece of evidence...
that was tainted, he walked.
uh, Charles Gish walked away.
nothing I could do about it.
the night after he was released...
Margaret's parents came home
that was the little girl's name
Margaret Sims.
and they found Charles Gish sitting in their living room.
he was watching television...
and Margaret was sitting next to him...
and he had cut her open right down the middle.
the parents found Margaret's heart in the freezer.
Charles figured they'd probably want to keep it.
after that, I left the D. A...
and joined the FBl.
figured I'd just try to catch 'em.
till now.
you know, I started to tell you...
that Stargher really isn't Stargher anymore.
well, that's true, and it's not.
the dominant side is still this horrible thing...
but there's a positive side that
positive side?
well, the way he sees himself as a child.
but isn't that him?
the boy Stargher made contact. He's curious about me.
if I could reach the boy...
then maybe he'd tell me about Julia.
whatever happened to Charles Gish?
old Charlie beat the murder rap...
because he was insane when he killed Margaret.
his attorney milked the jury for all they were worth.
said that a life of sexual abuse drove him to do these things...
and, you know, whatever the fuck.
all that same old bullshit.
why is that bullshit?
I believe a child can experience...
a hundred times worse the abuse than what Gish went through...
and still grow up to be...
somebody that would never, ever, ever hurt another living being.
and you're sure of that?
Yes, I am.
I'm sure of that.
Hey, where the hell you been?
I've been right here.
well, next time tell me, OK?
I didn't want to disturb you. You looked so cute, you know?
you're all sleeping when you get that look on you.
your colleagues want to know what to do with Stargher.
tell them to prep him. I'll be right there.
thank you, Catherine.
Stargher have any pets? You know, cats, dogs...
Yeah, you're a good boy, aren't you, Valentine?
that's supposed to help?
on a subconscious level, yes.
anything that was special to Stargher, gave him pleasure...
should make him more accessible...
more peaceful.
peaceful?
nice little pup.
Mr. Novak. -Doctor.
thank you.
round two.
Hey, not funny.
come on, stop playing around.
I'm not. It's a power problem.
we're locked out, Catherine.
I--I need you to check the circuit breaker.
I want you to check circuits six through twelve.
come on.
get up.
six through twelve.
I'm already in.
what did she say?
come here, boy.
can you take me to Carl?
need some help?
I've got a present for you.
if you need me...
or if you feel like I'm around but you can't find me...
just...
shine it like this.
go ahead, take it.
you like it?
Carl? -What's the matter?
what?
what's wrong?
what happened over here?
just broke all by itself.
did you break that plate? -I broke the plate.
did you break that plate? -I broke the plate.
well, hey, let's...
let's break 'em all, how about that?
you little fucking liar!
I should've drowned you like the runt of the litter.
you don't lie in my house.
this is my house!
he's just a boy. -Shut up!
you're not his mother!
she's not your mother.
do everything in your power to desexualize yourself.
wear a fanny pack, drive a Prius, attach electronic devices to your belt, whatever it takes.
and if you find yourself forced to talk to a woman, quickly find a way to mention the fact that you're married.
it doesn't even have to make sense.
Hi, how are you? Nice weather today. He's totally fucking married.
so I can't sleep with my wife, I can't sleep with other women?
what the hell is that?
marriage.
I think that's everything.
you got any more questions?
do you ever have any free time?
have you listened to a single word I've said?
there is no free time.
and at the end of the day, do you know what you get?
a fucking gun with a bullet to blow my head off with?
sometimes you wish.
Hi.
did you hear the good news?
Kinkabe and Amalgamated agreed to go into binding mediation in two days.
hold up. What do you mean? Two days?
so, I'll have my briefs on your desk by lunch.
that puts my balls on your chin by dinner.
that, right there, is Schedule IV sexual harassment.
