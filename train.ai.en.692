danone accused wahaha this week of setting up a parallel operation that bottled and sold the same drinks as the joint venture.
danone alleged that mr zong who managed the joint venture's 36 subsidiaries competed against its operations through at least 96 private companies, most of which also bore the wahaha name.
danone and wahaha formed a joint venture in 1996, and are now fighting over the terms of their agreement and the rights to the wahaha trademark in lawsuits and arbitration proceedings from samoa to stockholm, from the british virgin islands to los angeles, and in many different cities across china.
danone began legal proceedings in china against wahaha in april.
