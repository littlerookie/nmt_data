Iorgovan is here? - He is.
call the boy to water the horses.
stop! Who's there? - Come on, it's me.
where do you want to go? - Look for harvesters.
where?
what am I doing here?
don't you see the horse's dead- beat?
come! Come!
surprised?
I don't know.
Yes, I know I'm glad.
I've come to see how you are. You're in good health?
Yes, yes, why are you asking? - Just like that.
and you, Iorgovan?
I mind my business...
come to the harvest?
I don't know... Pa didn't think of going.
how about you?
me neither!
at last I saw you.
no use looking, Iorgovan, pa's not at home.
then why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?
I wanted to ask you last summer and I don't know what I didn't...
what do you want from me?
good day. - Good day.
pa, Iorgovan's come to call us to the harvest.
you covered all that road.
we had to to it, couldn't be helped.
then I'll get going, I'll wait for you at Curtici.
look at it! The poor horse!
look at it, it can barely stand up!
come on! Come on!
Oh, the poor beast!
welcome, folks! - Good day.
welcome, Toader, how are you?
you seem taller, and you're more beautiful.
go up, the old woman'll be glad.
Vico, come down see who's here.
well, Ion, how's things?
Sofron, where's the horse?
loss doesn't come out of the blue.
think I don't get it?
for the sake of a girl, spur the horse until you see it drop dead?
listen, Iorgovan, now there's too many folks here and I don't have time, but my heart can't stand such a thing.
be as merry as you can! Come on, be merry!
mirth and work, that's my philosophy.
work and mirth!
Hey, Birdie, why don't you dance?
Iorgovan, you don't feel like dancing?
I don't.
please do, that's how it's done.
what punishment you sent on me, God!
you can't, Ispir! - The deuce I can't!
what joke is that?
see for yourself... It's not that heavy...
what do I care if it's heavy or not?
I bet you can lift it too.
hear, hear, she says she doesn't care... Better said she can't!
you're wrong, Sofron!
fine piece of a girl!
I'm too old for this, uncle Neacsu, don't you think?
maybe.
fall in! At ease!
fall in At ease!!
Iorgovan. Come, it's late.
right. Right.
you'd better help them turn it up. -I'll do it with you and all.
come on! Come on!
Halt! Sop! Sofron!
I said stop!
simina. - Let me be.
simina. - Leave me alone, Sofron.
you know I want to kiss you?
you're stronger than me but kissing by force is no fun, I tell you.
let me be, Sofron, I'm embarrassed. - I won't if you don't kiss me back.
I want it ready by tomorrow! - We'll try.
come on, brothers, put more snap into it!
uncle Vasile, a little too much grain left behind.
uncle Toader, have you eaten today?
Iorgovan, go ahead, you know the place, come on.
you didn't tie the bale good. You didn't do it right!
bind that better!
you're mad?!
Sofron is a fool!
who dares gets the pie!
I don't understand, Simina, you want me to do what he does?
Oh, no, I'll do it.
you heat up fast, Iorgovan.
I guess you're ashamed of me.
don't say such things, Simina.
let's better be quiet. Having you close is good enough for me.
catch it, man!
I'd like to see you run to catch a flying bird.
he's crazy. I'd have been after it to catch it on the nest before I lifted the bale.
once it took off... I say one thing and you understand another!
I'd like to see you merry, like he is.
he must have reasons to be merry.
he doesn't. He just thinks he does.
it's enough to think you have, not to actually have! -Why don't you?
look at them!
they're fleeing from the city, driven out by cholera.
nothing serious, he's sick with the journey.
perhaps tomorrow it will be our turn.
I don't get it.
I didn't say anything, I was thinking of this life.
take the shovel and cover it up.
sing, so that people take courage!
come, brothers, come!
I'll never again hire these softies!
come on, we're wasting time!
my men, put more snap into it or Christmas will find us still here!
Hey, money don't come easy!
Simina, have you ever thought that we...
you'd had the courage?
why you think I've come now for all this disease?
I'm not afraid to die, Iorgovan.
cowards die before an early death.
Hey! - What's up, Birdie?
get out of here!
what's up? What's the matter, why are you laughing?
what? - Why are you laughing?
you smell so good! You put perfume on?
for me? - What's so funny about it?
you want to take off?
let me be...
I'll accept it, you know, but not now!
why do you force yourself on me?
forgive me! It's that I have this foreboding.
what foreboding? We'll all die, that's for sure.
don't joke with that!
death no longer is something that far away you might think.
you don't know what's downtown!
have no idea what cholera means! - You're really afraid to die?
call it zest for life, Simina, it's the same!
when you feel like me, pain...
as if someone pushes you from behind to do everything in one day.
Iorgovan, please wait...
Iorgovan!
let's not behave like animals, and do what they do. We're people!
where the deuce I put it? Whenever I look for it, it just isn't there!
what's the matter? Where you going? - To Curtici.
brother- in- law Busuioc called me. He has some trouble with Iorgovan.
I'll be back in no time, and I'll bring reapers, too.
all right!!
good day. - My respects, Father.
good work! - My respects, Father.
how many more days here? - Two.
then I'll wait for you at Socodor, as settled.
as settled. - Hope you haven't forgotten.
no, no. - My respects, Father.
who're you? - Lenuta of Mihut from Osasel.
very good. Fine work!
what's this? - Reaping, father.
where do you come from? - She's ours, father.
your daughter? - Yes.
where are you from? - From Zimbru.
we're church sextons. - From Zimbru, very good.
how's father, Toader? - Fine.
I'll be waiting for you at Socodor. - We'll be there.
in the company of a beautiful girl people work more briskly.
and what else do you say?
well, Father, I say you should wear a hat unless you want to get burnt.
those are quails, Iorgovan? - Yes, indeed.
then take your gun and come with me.
why didn't you fire? You thinking elsewhere?!
Iorgovan, mind you don't tempt Providence!
don't you dare hit on the girl.
if you want girls, your dad, Busuioc has enough wealth to get your married, and enough relatives to find you a suitable wife.
I don't want to hear bad things about you!
what? - What the heck can I say!?
I don't want her as my daughter-in-law.
but old as I am if I were a widower,
I'd do anything to marry her.
she's smart like a whip, well-stacked, and beautiful to kill.
brother-in-law, be good! You fear even your own shadow.
in time, he'll get fed up with her.
why don't you mind your own business? Let them deal with it.
let her knock her head against the wall.
it's rather him who'll do that! - Your health.
hark, folks! - Let everybody know this!
his Highness the Emperor, says his land is infested with cholera!
and he has decided thus:
nobody is allowed to eat unripe fruit!
prunes, apples, pears, cucumbers...
come over here - Who, me?
I have reapers, the wheat's gonna shed, if there's fear.
better go to the pub, say I sent you.
drink and eat as you please I'm buying!
let cholera be. If you have to go, God will take you anyhow.
what's the matter?
I'm tired, I've grown old.
don't work if you feel poorly. I'd better not come.
isn't it, my girl? Death won't get me so easily!
don't talk about death.
you think Iorgovan will marry you?
don't think so. - You're good, my girl.
simina!
what is it with this girl? - How about you and her?
I want to marry her. - I don't.
then leave her alone! - She won't leave me!
you're lying! You're lying! - He's not, Sofron!
he ain't lying!
we'll talk about it, there'll be things between us!
wait! What's up?
let's elope! I can't take it any more!
be brave, at least once!
where can we escape the worries we have with mom and dad, their fury, their money?
tell me about a spotless place on this earth!
cheer up! We must do something! Got to!
right, Simina, right, we'll leave. Tomorrow at dawn.
put it straight!
turn it.
Ispir, man! - Go away!
it's no good. - Ispir, my man!
go away! - lspir!
lspir, my man! - Leave, you fool!
mind your own business! Come on, pull! Now!
fix the belt right or it'll fall again!
fool, don't...
stop! Stop!
cursed be the hour when I brought you here!
a candle! A candle!
everybody feared cholera, and now it's sudden death.
God forgive him!
for things like this, you can't use people like Birdie.
the blood... Busuioc hasn't lost face.
they say he was his son, that's why he put so much trust in him.
stupid but from a mighty family!
can't be helped! - There's nothing you can do!
Sofron!
if pa looks for me, tell him I'll be back soon.
where you wanna go? - You know. Then why ask?
why do you make me say it? - OK, leave it... I'll go.
shouldn't have brought it indoors.
a dead man should stay, as the custom is, where he expired.
that's none of your business, and then you know Birdie had nobody.
I know very well who he had. May God rest him in peace!
he won't come. - Where is he?
not too far. - Where?
you can't go there. - Sofron, where's he?
at the pub. Petre!
he has this habit? Come on, I won't go alone!
my Goodness, what a frightful journey.
terrifying, see?
many villages don't even allow strangers in.
in other parts you can go as you please in the streets, the households are deserted...
how many died? - Who can tell?
some left like us, others locked themselves up in their homes...
Hey, folks, who knows whether there's pubs in kingdom come!?
Horatio or Virgil said this, or perhaps both. Right?
come on, rejoice while there's still time! Come on!
I have no time!
marcu thought he'd got it too, and all night long he kept his hands and head over the fire.
come on! - What?
how's that?
live just to keep death at bay as best we can?
but this is death!
old men think like this... - Let's just pretend we live.
old men think this is a cure.
nonsense, leave me be!
if you got it, nothing will help you pull through. It's fate!
anyway, I've had enough of this farce.
only for us is cholera a disease.
for His Highness the Emperor it's a godsend.
don't kill my joy or I'll send everything to hell!
just a word, and then you stay as long as you please.
I've come with Simina! She's outside!
yeah? Very good. I'll bring her in, to make merry with us!
our first night together. - Who?
you'll see!
come, girl! It's now or never!
let the girl be! Pity for two people like us!
she's not in your league! - Not in my league?!
what are you talking about? Why do you stick to her?
you forget who I am? You know who I am?
you're no good!
scum!
Busuioc's son who can do whatever he pleases as long as the old man's alive, then...
Sofron! - How dare you?
I am scum? - You're a laughing stock, better let's get in.
so you go with him?! - Sofron, mind your own business.
I'll come too!
Ratiu, Father Lucaciu... They're shut up in the Empire's jails while we...
What're gonna do, brother?
you like to make merry... As if you'd nothing to do with it.
it's not with memorandums but with Horea's lance that we should fight!
france and Britain staged solidarity demonstrations with the Memorandists...
and we're doing nothing At least this we can do: a protest demonstration.
don't heed him. That's how city boys are.
they're either lost in endless talks, or always reading some book.
by the way... You like to read, right?
I used to, in school. - Yes? How many years?
I did four. - Four!
was the teacher in your village handsome?
you're related to Iorgovan? - You're a cousin?
no. - How did you meet?
at the harvest. - Must have been beautiful.
Harvesting...
when you are alone what do you talk, you kiss?
what do you do? - Marta, you're upsetting me!
Why?
when I was little I liked harvesting very much.
and I liked best how girls used to sing at feasts.
by the way... Why don't you sing something? - Marta, leave her alone!
Why? I think she has a beautiful voice.
let's hear her!
Simina, if you want to...
high in the mount, three shepherds climb
two are brothers One's a stranger.
if you kill me take my little flute
give it to my mother.
perhaps I'm the bastard Sofron thinks I am.
you've got to understand me, I'm afraid! I'm afraid to live, to die, I'm afraid of us.
this fear gives you a terrific balance, brother Iorgovan!
half of you is afraid to die, while the other half in afraid to live.
see how man can become immortal?
only accidentally.
can you still forgive me?
leave me, I can walk by myself. - If you're uncomfortable, go ahead!
of course I'm uncomfortable! - Here!
Simina, I wouldn't like you to think I'm...
I don't know why, but I'm terribly happy you're with me now.
Simina, I know you since summer, but when I saw you now at the inn or with uncle Neacsu at the harvest, I could've not recognized you.
I felt... - What did you feel?
I thought that... - As I say!
I should hide you away, so that nobody else sees you...
look, from spring I'll no longer be a hired hand. I saved 900 silver pieces.
shepherd Busuioc loaned the money to folks at an interest.
Simina, I'll wait for you. I have all the patience.
I can see you won't love this man very long!
attention! Attention!
come! Come on in!
Iorgovan, tonight we sleep together.
you know I didn't mean to cross you, but we shouldn't get involved with them.
let's go. - No, pa.
don't ask me why, I don't know what to say.
I can't. Just can't.
it's like a curse.
welcome, father, come on in. - Cholera is now here.
two old folks and a man died tonight.
I spoke to him yesterday.
he could load a cart full of hay, he was strong, still the disease got him overnight and by morning he had spilled all his guts.
let's hitch the horses to the cart and take them back from where we took them.
it's easy for you to talk, you finished your work. How about me?!
if I don't hurry my grains will remain unharvested.
whatever you think fit, whatever God wills.
they can't leave home for the roads are closed.
at least at Socodor, folks'd work.
here they do nothing. - When do the roads close?
beats me!
they're talking about a sanitary cordon, with checkpoints here and there.
I'd hurry then, to take the wheat to Arad.
now?! That would be madness!
don't panic, Father.
only those who haven't got enough strength to stay healthy die of cholera.
I'm going, my girl.
don't forget we've always lived an honest, God fearing life.
I'll come too, tomorrow at the latest.
don't tempt fate, man! Don't go!
everybody's terrified of this epidemic only you won't see reason!
leave me alone, don't you see I'm up to my ears in work!
at least, let Iorgovan stay. - Ma, please!
I didn't call him! - Ma, please!
Iorgovan, where you want to go? At least you stay home.
Mr. Busuioc, wait. - You can't go!
I have to! - The roads are closed, you can't go anywhere.
to Arad, you see! - It's cholera. mister!
a peasant died on the road, one who worked for you.
pull the cart in the yard!
simina.
what relatives have you got?
an uncle at Zimbru and an aunt with three kids at Socodor.
why you ask?
your father died!
Pap!
why did he die? - Of cholera.
you know how he died?
I only know he had a candle with him.
what should I do now?
go and unbridle your hair.
I'm leaving for your uncle from Zimbru, and by dawn I'll bring the man here.
to wash and put him in state for the wake!
wake!
Sofron, don't go! Let some one else go.
you can't leave me alone.
you see...
no one else will go.
but I'm not afraid.
where do I lay father, where shall the wake be?
Simina, it's been arranged to bury him here, at Socodor.
for a while you'll live with us, to be closer to him.
I left father all by himself.
had I been with him... Or Iorgovan'd stayed at his schools...
Iorgovan!
Iorgovan, your pa is calling.
sit.
Iorgovan, it's not that you want or because I decided so but because it's God's will and also what your poor mother wants.
especially now that the cholera's gone, we think you should marry Simina.
Agreed? - No.
why not? Now I want it and your mother, Vica, wants it too.
why don't you want?
this woman is not for me. And I'm not for her.
Iorgovan, my boy, you don't really believe it.
I've been watching you long.
since this girl went away you had no peace.
you didn't sleep, you lost weight. You're pining.
the girl's beautiful and good.
she's suffered a lot and it's not proper that you turn your back on her.
you love her, Iorgovan, there's nothing to be ashamed of.
you tell me that?
you of all people?!
wait here. - Welcome.
my regards, sister-in-law. - Welcome.
the Father asks you to excuse him, he had to leave in a hurry.
the time's come to go a-wooing Simina.
tell me, shouldn't you talk to her kin, as the custom goes?
tell her to come here.
a derelict girl to hesitate when I go pay court to her?
God forgive me!
Simina... How about you?
you stay here, you go to your aunt, or you come for good to my house where you are so much desired?
for the time being I'll stay with my aunt at Socodor.
OK. I just wanted to know.
for now you want this. You'll let me know when you change your mind.
Yes.
how is it? - Alright.
from where I stand you look very down in the mouth.
it's all right. Couldn't be better!
it's you that fed me all this nonsense!
it's your fault!
how's that? Am I one to pick someone in the street?
sorry! But Simina has her kin!
she must confer with her relatives. Phew!
let the entire village know that l, Busuioc, have to woo her.
ask her down-at-heels folks for her hand.
because of you and of this wretch!
who is never sure what he wants!
just you wait, Simina, just you wait for me to come courting you!
what's the matter, Sofron, what happened? You forget something?
Nope. I just came.
Busuioc didn't send me. I want to talk to Simina, if that's possible.
alright, come in, Sofron.
sit down, Sofron.
look...
it's nothing, it will pass.
it took me by surprise.
I wanted to say...
it's good that you marry Iorgovan.
you'll never forget me for what I did to you.
who, l?
Sofron, I won't marry Iorgovan.
he separated me from father the day he died.
he separated me from you.
he lied to me exactly when...
he's weak, doesn't know his own mind.
look, not for me, who am unworthy...
but because you cared for the departed and he for you...
you won't stay with Busuioc, anyways.
so move here, to Socodor so that dad be not alone.
sure thing.
how could I not come?!
what?
I've come to settle our accounts.
time I went.
fine. Gladly!
but you know I don't have money on me.
I lent it to other folks.
call Toader and Oancea to me.
Hello! - Good day.
allow for one or two months.
I lost an ox this spring, then...
Gadly, but you know, the money's not mine.
talk to Sofron.
Sofron, give me one or two months.
I don't have money with you!
all my money is with Busuioc.
he has it and I don't know what he did with it.
I have nothing to say to you!
help catch the pig.
I've come for the money.
I tell you, Sofron! I don't need your money.
I just looked for folks who wanted to borrow.
Oh, no, I gave you the money.
when we made the deal it was included in the wage.
I worked my guts out to put it by and I didn't want to entrust it to anybody.
and I looked for a rich, honest person, who could give it back to me at any time.
here, I said, take this money and keep it for me.
wasn't that the deal? - That's it, Sofron.
only that I didn't take your money for myself.
I gave it with interest to folks.
sue the debtors for your money.
but I gave the money to you. That was the deal.
he shouldn't have done that! It stinks!
Iorgovan, don't forget he's your father and you have no right to judge him!
I've had enough! -Iorgovan!
I'm sick and tired of living in this house! Sick and tired!
calm down!
I'm a foolish man and don't know much. Don't make me do something bad...
anyway, my life isn't worth a thing.
but you have a pretty fortune and a child.
I'm afraid of myself so you too should fear yourself.
listen, Sofron, go find something to do in the yard!
sprinkle the dust with some water!
then we'll see. But quick! Let me enjoy my food!
well, now do enjoy your food!
the animal!
don't laugh, jackass! It's because of you!
the priest's wife's grown old!
Iorgovan!
we're celebrating!
it's the evenings of all feasts, right?
come, I see you're free of cholera. How are you? Sad or cheery?
I don't know. - That's it!
we celebrate and take comfort that what's impossible can't be possible!
and you, how are you? Do you love, hate, suffer, what?
I just drink.
I don't even take the trouble to look for reasons.
Yeah, we're neither live nor die.
we neither love nor hate.
we just make believe that...
forget it, have a glass.
at lest when it comes to drinking we don't pretend but actually drink!
men's affairs, right? To hell with your all!
you, father, mother, the Emperor...
this entire foolish world that gets to you,
doesn't let you...
everybody is so knowledgeable, gives you advice, tells you how to be or not to be!
what to say, how to pray!
but not a single soul to really understand you! That no!
speak less loud! - What? You think I'm afraid?!
franz, may the cholera get you! - What have I done?
what do you want? - What have I done?
I was talking about the Emperor.
God save and protect him, for I've had enough!
of course you can call names even to God above.
you've this edge. Your dad coughs the money and the authorities don't hear a thing.
but evil is in us. We're cowards, Iorgovan.
cowardly and slothful.
why bother, better lay the blame on others.
why am I to blame for being Busuioc' son? You want me to scold him?
what do you want me to do? What can I do?
what can we do now that there's no more cholera.
you really don't know?
it's simple, we wait for the pest or for leprosy.
I left you here I find you here. - What calamity is left for us?
they stole our schools, our land, and faith, even our thoughts.
words, man, words! - Words, you say?
gone is the time of words. Come with us?
we're staging a protest demonstration. - All right!
if we want to destroy everything we have, then fine.
we can wait and wait for there'll come no salvation.
I can't believe all the men born in the land of lancu and Horea have vanished.
you don't get it, at all! - Get what, man?
you want to move mountains? Others will come and put them back.
I'm content to be alive, understand? That's all I want.
I don't offend anybody by this.
I lodged a complaint to have him arrested if he threatens to kill me.
I want only my money. - I won't give it because I just won't!
let him sue me!
a trial lasts long!
I'll teach him never to threaten me with a knife!
I tell you now, I want no law suit.
but I either stab you, or set fire to your house.
sometime, I'll come out of jail.
you'll get out today, and let me worry about the money.
go with them. I'll come and get you out.
we'll see! - You'll see!
you found him? - Not yet.
why are you so late? - I found him only Thursday.
he told me to wait and I haven't seen him since.
Iorgovan didn't come.
a wife'd keep him at home more...
he's become so mean. - He'll be back.
better he stayed there. - He'll be back for sure.
Iorgovan is never equal to himself.
you'll see he'll come back even more ashamed.
he's cheated on me with the mill lately.
could've asked me for money instead of doctoring the figures.
and leave my inheritance to him to drink it up?
and run the household when I'm gone?
this way, in a few years he'll drink it all! There'll be nothing left!
Sofron, here is your money. 900.
count it.
Busuioc withdrew his complaint. I talked to him.
come on in!
listen here well, got to take care of these papers!
sign here.
this is a deed of property. You won't get other. Understood?
now, work and merriment.
I invite you to take off this city garb.
if you want to be a ploughman, then dress like one!
and don't let me catch you at the pub. Got enough wine in the cellar.
drink as much as you please, but at home, Iorgovan!
don't put me to shame in public!
think a little about your future.
why, papa? You already planned my future, right?
you're right here.
I'm always right!
don't cry, ma, from now on you'll really have reasons to.
I don't know what I'll do, if I meet him again.
hear, man? Come on!
Mr. Busuioc ordered me not to give you any more.
so Busuioc, a rich man from Curtici, but you see, I'm more than Busuioc, I'm his son!
it's not Busuioc who gives the orders around here but l!
and I don't fool around. Bring the wine!
well... Then I told him: "These are papers!"
but he was thinking of this woman whom he wants to bring home...
Iorgovan, do you remember the Forest Woman?
I do. Pretty well.
hell of a beautiful woman!
you know she's with Sofron now? Hell of a forest man!
what did you say? She's with him?
Simina is with him? What?
stop, stop!
what have you become, Iorgovan? And my family?
what have you done? -I did nothing.
you did everything.
look what he did to me. - Mr. Busuioc, the hell with...
look!
if there's anything else tell me and I'll pay. You know me, but forgive him...
come drink. This is your home, not the pub.
what is it? What?
come on!
leave him, he doesn't make any sense.
come on!
that's it, brother!
come on!
stop, fool! What are you doing? What are you doing?
I'll go to Simina, pa!
Iorgovan, wait Iorgovan! Wait!
boil some water and fetch some strips of cloth.
quiet now. Quiet.
it's pretty bad, but the boy's young and he could still make it.
we'll do everything we can.
I'll give you all my fortune, just that he lives and goes again to the pub.
no, pa, you'll see there'll be no more drinking for me.
Simina, don't go!
or you love him as much as I love you. Don't go!
I can't! See? I can't help it!
go. Now go! Go now!
Sofron... How's he?
fine, in good health.
you thought.
a candle!
Iorgovan! Iorgovan!
my baby!
my baby!
Iorgovan!...
cholera!
Iorgovan died of cholera.
I know it! This is cholera!
brother-in-law, don't panic.
he was good, honest, decent.
cholera doesn't pick. Cholera doesn't choose!
why do you die of cholera? Why are you looking at me?
don't you hear? Why don't they take measures?
we have cholera in the village!
take the drum and don't lose any time. Cholera I said, cholera you cry! Come!
my goodness, when are we going to get rid of this epidemic?
Oyez, Oyez! Oyez! Let everyone hear and note!
his Highness the Emperor said cholera's struck again.
nobody is to eat any apples, pears, anything. Don't eat anything, folks!
why are you standing still? Why are you giving me these stupid looks?
don't you understand, cholera's back! Iorgovan died of cholera!
he was good, clean and read in high schools.
this disease takes pity on no one!
do something. Must take measures.
don't you understand?
it's cholera!
cholera's got to the village!
ladies and gentlemen,
I made the film we are about to present.
please come and leaf through this album with me.
this is madame.
this is monsieur.
this is Monsieur and Madame Corniche, friends of monsieur and madame.
here are the three of us: the maid...
the cook...
and yours truly.
there's another gentleman who isn't in the film but whom I must mention. Here he is.
he's a composer.
the music you hear is his.
and I must mention Mr. Bachelet, who lit the film.
he's the director of photography, and a remarkable man.
Mr. Gernolle, who recorded the sound, also deserves credit.
the editor, Myriam, our assistant director, Gilles Grangier, and Guy Lacourt, our production manager.
you've probably guessed that the sets were designed by Mr. Jean Perrier.
I hope I didn't forget anyone.
and now, ladies and gentlemen,
I wish you a pleasant time in our company.
coming!
chartreuse, my love?
some wine?
no.
no, thanks.
I'll have some.
people usually offer what they want themselves.
what else is there?
what are you reading about? - Those stolen emeralds.
they suspected the maid, of course.
and it wasn't her. - Actually, it was.
what now?
just to keep her on her toes.
let's talk about our trip tomorrow so she hears.
I can understand your impatience, but Deauville without a valet is a frightening thought.
did madame ring?
our benedictine?
sorry, madame.
let's have a look at the news.
good cook, 35. Cannot leave Paris.
write to A. B. 11 bis rue Marbeau.
Augustine's leaving her new job again.
she never stays put.
madeleine will serve, and I can have a woman come in to help clean.
it's all decided. We're leaving tomorrow.
sorry about the benedictine. I completely forgot.
one must never forget anything, Madeleine.
let that be a lesson.
valet, 42, 1, 200 francs a month.
he's asking a lot.
what did they want? - I forgot the benedictine.
seven liqueurs in there, and they want something else.
she wasn't far from the cabinet, but she had to bother me to "teach me a lesson.
and then they expect us to like them!
what were they talking about?
what were they talking about? Us, of course.
what do you think?
anytime we go in, bosses are talking about us.
if they stop talking, it was bad.
if they keep talking, it's so we'll hear.
they pretend they haven't seen us and drop little nuggets like, "Madame So-and-so has found a gem for 600 francs a month!
Or..."People who steal from me don't last 24 hours.
this is my ninth position, and all my bosses ever talked about was money and servants.
unless they were fighting.
and that bachelor you worked for for a year?
that was different.
he married the girl after me. Didn't I tell you?
I found out a week ago.
anyone we know? - No. She's Belgian.
why didn't he marry you?
maybe he wasn't ready two years ago.
or she got pregnant. - I say you left too soon.
I'd had enough.
I stayed 18 months, and what did I get, besides wages?
twenty francs a time.
it wasn't that often either.
anyway, I'm not keen on that with employers.
they get too many ideas.
we think they like us as women... - but no.
they say, "No, keep your apron on.
in the end it's just lust, and that never turns into love.
sometimes they marry one of us.
so they get everything free.
so what were they talking about?
their trip to Deauville, of course. - And?
she says they're leaving tomorrow come what may.
with no valet? I'm not going!
don't go flying off the handle!
they said it in front of me to sound us out.
they're not stupid.
they wanted us to talk about it. - Then let's talk!
calm down. You can get so hot and bothered.
it must be the stove.
when I help her get undressed, we'll talk, and I'll tell her what I think. - What will you say?
has madame considered that Deauville is four times larger than here?
exactly.
and with two guest rooms, and six people at dinner, we can't do our work properly.
tell her this for me:
a cook can't work outside the kitchen and still cook well!
of course.
I want to know if we're going... - no last-minute surprises.
that's the third one today. - No, the fourth.
they have one hope left. - What's that?
they said a valet would be coming by tonight.
it's already 10: 00. He won't be coming now.
she was crazy to sack Emile. She won't find another like him.
maybe she doesn't want to.
between you and me, Emile went a bit far.
you'll burn yourself. - It's okay.
you can't pinch a cigar every single day.
Yeah, that wasn't smart.
he was like that with everything. Remember the liqueurs?
know what I really didn't like?
he drank straight from the bottle. That's just not right.
I tell you, I've never touched her powder puff.
if I'm out of powder, sure, I'll take a bit of hers, with the shoe horn.
but her powder puff is hers, see? - I do.
I'll go and act like I'm tidying up, or else they'll get up to you-know-what and keep us longer.
listen, how was my coffee? - Fantastic.
what about theirs? - She called it vile.
that's a bit much, but it is bad.
she wants us to eat first, so of course the second pot tastes like dishwater.
I'm sorry to stand in your way...
but I'm adamant about this.
may I clear? - If you like.
it's madness to go without a valet.
I intend to entertain, and I want a man to wait table.
no offense, my dear, but I don't think a woman has the physical strength.
I should apply for Augustine's job, since she's leaving.
if I may, a lady in your situation shouldn't be without a valet in Deauville.
you see?
tongues would wag in the other villas.
butter...
how much was the butter today?
thirty-four francs.
eggs...
leg of lamb...
67 francs, and cheap at the price.
things are bad in there!
Monsieur insists they can't go without a valet.
good! Then we're staying.
I have two questions. - Go ahead.
how much is seven and eight? - Usually 15.
and do you think they really love each other?
them? You gotta be joking!
they have too much to gain from being together.
she just wants him to marry her.
that's all she's been after for three years.
she gave up acting.
I hear it was no great loss for the theater.
if everyone with no talent gave up acting...
anyway, it was a sacrifice for her.
she wants to be Madame Montignac.
the thing is, all her efforts seem to put him off the idea.
but he is fond of her.
you can sense he's flattered to have such a stylish mistress.
but really love each other? That's a different kettle of fish.
maybe if the stakes weren't so high.
love for more than one reason isn't love.
you're very smart. - I think so.
but will he end up marrying her? - When he doesn't love her anymore.
what's this? That can't be my man yet.
I've come for the valet position.
what? Am I too late?
no, your timing's perfect.
good Lord, you shouldn't shout like that.
I'll tell madame. Who sent you?
what's she doing?
I got a message to be here before 11: 00.
I'm in time. - Yes. They're expecting you.
have a seat. I'll let madame know.
was that you?
let me ask you: What's it like here?
in what way? - As a place to work.
fine. Why?
otherwise I'd leave right now.
he's right. - It's a very nice position.
there's more?
wait a second. She's in such a rush.
one more thing: How many of us are there?
servants?
me, the maid and you. And the chauffeur.
very good. And how many of them?
there's just one of them. - "One of them"?
I mean, it's a single woman.
is that all right? - Maybe.
then I'll go tell her.
you're not done?
one more thing. Before she decides if I fit the bill,
I'd like to know if I fit yours, because I don't like trouble.
would you be glad if I took the position?
certainly! - Of course!
you can be frank.
better the truth now than moaning and groaning later.
I won't force myself on you.
why would we moan and groan?
I don't know.
perhaps you'd prefer another woman.
just the opposite.
then if you don't object...
on the contrary!
all right. Go on, then.
thank you.
kindly have a seat, monsieur.
certainly, madame.
you're not employed now? - Not since nine days ago. Why?
we may be leaving tomorrow for madame's villa in Deauville.
does that suit you? - Very well. I don't know Deauville.
does madame ask for references?
Yes. Don't you have any?
Oh, lots.
Madame's waiting. - Coming.
I'll leave my hat with you, if I may.
please take very good care of it.
when they heard, they went "Ah!
so they know me. - No.
ask them for 700 francs a month.
I was going to ask for 800.
please come in.
are you available now? - Yes, madame.
could you leave Paris tomorrow? - Yes, monsieur.
how much a month? - 800 francs, with wardrobe.
you have references? - Of course.
please let me see them.
caught you! - You did no such thing.
why are you doing up your hair? Anyway, what's wrong with liking him?
what about Victor? - What about him?
you've cheated on him before.
I've never cheated on Victor.
what about Marcel?
Marcel? - The old chauffeur.
what a memory.
I'd forgotten all about him. Proves it didn't matter.
he's better than Marcel, if you like that sort of thing.
you think he's ugly? - I didn't say that.
I just don't go for valets.
a man with no mustache looks like a show-off.
I don't mind a nice stocky man.
each to her own.
I hear a door.
he's coming back. - Already?
scared? - Don't be silly.
well? Is it settled?
I think so.
she said to wait here for five minutes, probably so they can chat.
or call your prior employer. - You think so?
maybe. That's what they usually do.
we can't stop them.
why did you say it was a single woman?
because it is.
then who's the gentleman with her?
her boyfriend. - How stupid of me.
of course, the boyfriend. So they live together?
no, he has dinner here but sleeps at his place.
they only live together during the summer in the country.
so she's not a slut?
we mustn't call her a slut, and we didn't.
it's just her way. - We need more like her.
she looks quite proper. - Very proper.
you'd never think she was in the theater.
she was at the theater tonight? - No, she was an actress.
Yes, no more than a year ago.
why does she put on those airs? Maybe to get him to marry her.
he caught on right away. - It wasn't that hard.
employers are strange.
they send for you, look you up and down, ask lots of questions.
we answer however we like, and it's settled.
we've got their number, but they don't know who we are.
very true. Why do you think that is?
I think it's because... - How can I put it?
the questions they ask are more important than the answers we give.
I don't get it. - Me neither, I'm afraid.
it's hard to explain a gut feeling, but it's like this:
the person asking the questions can't help giving himself away, and the person listening sees where he's going.
I think it's mainly that. Don't you think so?
no? Oh well.
you got that? - Perfectly. Didn't you?
I'm starting to. - She's sweet.
you be sweet too and go see if she phones my old boss.
happy to. - Sorry to impose.
not at all.
what do you think?
she's very cute.
no, I meant the boss. - Of course you did.
she has lovely eyes.
though personally I prefer blondes on the heavy side.
no answer.
just as well. Forget about that.
he makes a nice appearance.
he has an excellent reference. What more do you want?
she called, but no one answered.
we were just chatting.
there's an astonishing resemblance between him and Montignac.
are you joking? - No.
I've only seen pictures, but that man looks amazingly like...
why are you laughing? - Because it is Montignac!
the minister?
no wonder it looks like him.
that man's the minister?
he looks very proper for a minister.
he's very nice.
do we call him "monsieur le ministre"? - Now and then.
right. Best not to overdo it.
that must be for you.
who did you work for before? - Countess Diepchinska.
an English lady? - On the contrary.
I mean, she was an Algerian who married a Russian man who died. Sorry.
an amazing man, the kind that lives 100 years.
to see him on the morning of his death, who'd have thought that six hours later...
how did he die? - Run over.
I told you his life and death in a nutshell.
did you leave on your own?
my former boss? Yes and no.
we agreed to separate. Her reference says it all.
is it a good reference? - They always are.
well, that's that.
she called again? - No, she's hiring you.
Really? Why didn't she just say so?
I'm very happy, and I mean it sincerely.
you made a very good impression.
I'm not surprised.
and since the terms have been agreed upon, you can sleep here tonight...
to be ready at dawn. - Very well.
you have a nightshirt?
I brought one in my bag, just in case.
Where's my room? - Right next to mine.
like in Deauville. There they overlook the garden.
here we have two rooms on the street.
what about the cook here?
she's married.
my word!
she doesn't sleep here.
she married a policeman. Must be three years now.
he's only three? - No, three years ago!
I can just see a tiny little policeman...
what a laugh!
your room's this way, at the top of the stairs.
very nice.
you can come and go as you like.
Madame allows us out at night?
do you need her permission?
I don't want to be any trouble.
you can't stop a man from going out.
you're not a ladies' man? - A man is always a man.
sometimes, yes.
so it's just madame, you, and me who sleep in the house.
of course. I'll make up your room.
I'll do that myself.
starting tomorrow, yes, but I'll do it the first night.
you're leaving already?
it's past 11: 00. Victor must be waiting.
here he is now.
did you want me to stay while you make up his bed?
no, don't keep your husband waiting. I'll keep an eye on your kitchen.
good-bye, dear.
see you tomorrow.
trust me. Don't call that woman.
don't go looking for problems.
I promise.
see you tomorrow.
Monsieur is leaving. I have to check on madame.
well, good night, Mr?
a very nice name. Good night.
I hope we'll make a nice household.
Oh, I forgot to offer you a drink.
never between meals.
but if you had paper and an envelope...
no problem at all. Ah! Did I hurt you?
not at all.
here's the paper, and over here's...
the ink.
make yourself comfortable.
well, good-bye and good night.
coming!
Aha! The police are impatient.
sorry to bother you, but here's why I'm calling.
I just read your reference...
dear Mother...
fortunately...
it didn't take long...
to find...
a new position.
I have time to make your bed. She's calling right now.
my old boss? - I think so.
it's a very delicate matter.
you mustn't make me spell it out.
just one pillow?
just one pillow? - I only have one head.
it didn't take long to find a new place that...
well, I'll just wait.
he did something?
I believe you understand. I won't say more.
I beg you to keep this to yourself.
I promise.
it's such a grave matter.
indeed.
good-bye, madame.
good-bye, and thank you.
my sweetie...
Where's the bell board? They don't make it easy.
that's madame's voice.
I'd go see, but if she isn't dressed...
but I can't just let her shout. I have to help.
Madeleine, where are you?
she's not here, madame.
she's making up my room.
Ah, your room...
the thing is... - - Yes?
I just received a call from a friend whom I asked to find me a valet.
she just found one tonight.
now I'm in an awkward situation as far as you're concerned.
but why, madame?
if madame doesn't wish to keep me, she should just say so, but there's no point hiding the truth.
why, what...
Madame probably phoned my former employer, who convinced her not to hire me. - Not at all!
if I dared, I'd tell madame she doesn't lie very well and that she'd be doing me a favor by telling me.
if that woman means to continue wronging me,
I won't use her reference.
she gives me an excellent reference, then speaks ill of me in person.
that's not right.
that's twice this week.
I can understand employers sticking together, but let a man earn his keep.
forgive me, but may I ask if the lady told madame why I left?
she only intimated.
and did that frighten madame? - Well, yes!
of course.
I mustn't insist.
then I'll simply wish madame a good night.
here I was, writing my mother that it didn't take me long to find a position.
I'm sorry.
not as sorry as I am, I assure you.
come in.
forgive me, madame.
would madame mind terribly telling me exactly what the lady said?
I'd find it quite awkward.
but I swear on my mother's life I wouldn't tell a soul.
Madame realizes it's best I know what people are saying about me. - She wasn't really specific.
she just said that...
I promised her I wouldn't tell you.
but I've sworn on my mother's life.
Madame can believe me.
she said you did something. - Did something?
something so serious that she had to dismiss you on the spot.
that's all?
she didn't tell madame what it was I did?
what does madame imagine?
heavens, I...
does madame think I stole?
I can't have anyone thinking that! That's very serious!
let it be on that woman's conscience!
Oh, I can just see her saying that it's dangerous having me in madame's home.
Madame of course immediately thought of her jewels.
well, I can't have people thinking such a thing!
if that lady acts like this, there's nothing I can do, but I'm going to explain exactly what happened.
she and I were alone one night in her apartment and...
there! I said it.
but... I don't understand.
Madame doesn't understand?
I said that she and I were alone in her apartment that night. - And what of it?
Madame should think about what a man and a woman do alone.
Madame's put her finger on it.
Yes, it's what madame's thinking.
that lady will claim it wasn't her fault.
Madame knows these things can't happen if one party refuses.
a lady says, "Leave me alone," but you know what that means.
or she asks, "What are you doing?" when she knows full well.
I recognize that what I did wasn't right, but does one call one's valet to one's boudoir at 1: 00 a. m.
in a tiny negligee because the curtain is sticking?
Oh, I know what they say: "A valet is not a man.
well, now she knows.
I don't know how she feels, but it'll be a lesson to me.
from now on I'll avoid putting myself in awkward situations.
and to be honest, madame is less at risk with me than with a man with no such experience.
one can't be sure of oneself until one's made a mistake, but once it's done, one avoids repeating it.
but if madame doesn't trust me, I mustn't insist.
I'll take my leave.
did she at least acknowledge I was a good servant?
she did indeed.
on that score I have no fear.
honesty, cleanliness, impeccable service.
I'm of the old school. Fourth generation.
not a blemish in the family.
and I started as a page for the Marquis de Casselas.
so if madame ever wished to put on an elegant show, madame couldn't go wrong with me.
I don't mean to give madame advice, but madame would be wrong to be influenced by what amounts to foolishness.
foolishness?
Yes, madame, foolishness!
Madame is not my former employer.
and madame would be hurting herself by not hiring me.
certainly madame would never tolerate what happened to a woman of 42... - or so she says.
Madame can see I'm no satyr, but I am a man, and a man only needs to be clearly shown his place.
I know my heart well, and I can assure madame that she can trust me.
doesn't madame want to try me?
I mean, give me a trial?
well, I...
I can't believe madame would be scared of me.
of course not.
if I may,
I could say something to help madame decide.
what would that be?
I'll tell madame straight out.
Madame has nothing to fear from me in that regard.
why is that?
well... how can I put this without being impolite?
everyone has the right to their own ideas and tastes, do they not?
I understand. I'm not your type.
that's it! Madame does nothing for me.
no offense either, but just between us,
I prefer it that way. - So madame is keeping me on?
I mean, I think in madame's thoughts I'm already in her service.
I can see it in madame's eyes.
do say yes, madame, so I can send Mother the good news.
Madame is laughing... - a good sign.
very well. See you tomorrow.
Madame's scarf.
70 and 10 is 80, plus 4 is 84, plus my two tierces and my belote.
and I forgot my last trick. That makes...
144. How about that?
I'm so happy to be here that I don't even mind losing.
your turn.
so what do you think of Deauville?
it's wonderful.
you like the villa? - I should say so.
it's charming.
three... and three.
shall we retire? - It's early.
we'll be up early.
pardon me, but I think I'll hit the sack.
so early?
you know what I've got on my hands?
I have four clubs.
no, I mean I have 100 windows to wash tomorrow.
you must be exhausted.
I can't wait to snuggle up to my pillow.
are they going out? - They didn't mention it at dinner.
no, not the first night.
see? They're going to bed. - They're waiting.
Madeleine, come help me undress.
Yes, madame.
it's a lovely dress, madame. - Yes, very.
you can close up. We're going to bed.
shall I help monsieur?
no, thank you. See you tomorrow.
see you tomorrow, monsieur.
might I ask if monsieur is happy with me?
extremely. - Thank you, monsieur.
good night, madame.
what is it?
that was stupid of me. - What was?
I should have kept my ace of diamonds earlier.
to think one day you could be president.
why do you say that?
when I see you in your underwear, I can't help thinking about that.
what an idea!
see you soon, maybe.
good night, my dearest darling.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Madeleine!
come help me undress.
Madame is so beautiful!
Madame is so lovely! - What?
what lovely eyes!
now that's funny!
I don't want to!
leave me alone!
leave me alone!
well, I'll be!
well, well. What are you two doing here?
just came to say hello. - Very kind.
are we disturbing you? - Not at all.
are you waiting for them? - Not really waiting.
but waiting all the same.
you get attached to your employers.
very quickly.
and he's always sticking up for them.
to me, our employers aren't like us.
we must be very indulgent with them.
when I work for someone, they belong to me.
what's so funny? - Nothing.
I see. You came here to make fun of me.
fine. Back to work.
can't we have a laugh? - That's enough.
Monsieur is angry. Come on.
you first, Baroness. - After you, Duchess.
Adieu, Marquis.
good-bye, females.
what do those two idiots have to laugh about?
did you ring the bell? - They're back!
Julien, have dinner and come for us by 10: 15.
very good, monsieur.
no visitors? - No, madame.
did madame win at the races? - No, I lost, as always.
that's what happens when you bet on all the losers.
did monsieur win? - Yes.
corniche will help me make it up at baccarat tonight.
indeed. By the way, four for dinner.
are we done with our little mazurka?
it was so elegant and charming this afternoon.
I had an enchanting day. - I'm glad, my dear.
what is it? - Alone at last.
I've wanted a word with you since this morning, but we haven't had a moment alone. - That's true.
let's make good use of it - Anything serious?
sit down. - And now?
and now listen.
don't let my questions surprise you.
I think he's perfect. Don't you? - Yes, terrific.
but I mean apart from his work.
I don't understand your question.
as a man.
I've never considered him as a man.
why are you blushing? - Me?
Yes, you.
you're embarrassing me. - Nothing embarrassing about it.
ask me about Madeleine, and I'd just say she's pretty.
am I supposed to say he's not bad?
just tell me exactly what you think without getting upset.
I'm not upset. - Or angry.
I'm not angry! - You're shouting.
you're being a pain!
I'm a pain?
you've never said that before.
it's odd that you'd speak to me like that just discussing our valet.
my question wasn't offensive.
Yes, it was!
very well. I'll ask it a different way.
or his attitude toward you the slightest sign of any feeling you might have provoked in him?
stop right there. The answer's absolutely no.
he's never been anything but proper and perfectly respectful.
but you tell me: Have you noticed something?
not at all. - Well then?
did someone tell you, or write you an anonymous note?
did you learn something from his past employers?
no, nothing. - Then what is all this about?
let me tell you.
now that you've answered and I've seen how sincere you are,
I'll give you a good laugh.
do you remember your dreams?
my dreams? Never. I'm not even sure I dream.
do you remember what you dreamed last night?
last night? No.
what!
you talked so loud that you woke me up.
how awful! How could such a thing happen?
we don't choose our dreams, but put yourself in my shoes.
I can imagine! How awful!
I'm so upset. How you must have felt!
it was quite an unpleasant feeling, despite the humorous aspect.
humorous? - Let's be honest.
at least after a while it became humorous.
after a while? - Yes, because you see...
it's been going on for a week.
every night since we arrived here.
your frolicking wakes me up regularly around 2: 00 a. m.
don't laugh! This is terrible. What's the matter with me?
nothing. - It must be something.
you're mad. - Perhaps.
no, I mean to think it's more than just an obsessive thought...
poor dear, how awful!
is it always the same? - Exactly.
at first you resist. - I should think so!
then you give in and end up very happy.
Oh, do be quiet! How awful!
my God! - What?
his room is above ours. Do you think he's heard?
we have to find out. - How?
we'll do an experiment. - No, I'm not listening from his bedroom. - You have to.
then I'm not sleeping there tonight.
or anywhere else. - You're not going to bed?
I wouldn't dare go to sleep.
what's wrong?
I see it all now! - All what?
I remember it all! - All what?
my dream!
because we talked? - Perhaps.
you're sure? Then that cancels it all out.
you believe that?
did madame call? - No!
but I heard her. - Madame was singing.
that was singing? How odd. Sorry.
dismiss him immediately. - Why?
after what he's done!
don't take it so seriously.
wait a night or two.
if it keeps up, we'll have no choice.
it'd be a shame. He's a first-class valet.
the one time it works out... - what rotten luck.
is the newsstand where you buy your papers far?
no, very close. What do you want?
I'd like a little...
Madame rang? - For Madeleine.
Yes, but Madeleine is gone. - What?
I mean, she's gone out.
she's gone to the...
the man who removes stains. The cleaner.
of course. - Wait.
what paper do you want? - It's not a paper.
what is it? - Say the word, madame.
it's a little red book in the corner.
and it's called?
the Key to Dreams.
unfortunately they're all out, because I bought the last copy yesterday.
but of course I'll lend it to madame. - Okay.
pardon? - Okay.
I'm okay, thanks.
I'm not asking that. I'm telling you to go.
see? He's heard everything!
he wanted to understand my dreams!
calm down. Here.
look up what you're interested in.
we'll let it fall open to see what page he was reading.
erotic dreams...
always happen for a reason.
they point to a subconscious love of which the dreamer is still unaware.
that's stupid and vile!
the stupid thing is consulting a book like that. Give it here.
no, I want to try another page.
look what you did! You ripped the page!
I'll tear it out completely. - That'll be worse.
but he'll see what I was reading.
then let him!
who's doing that?
don't open the door now. - Why not?
I'm leaning against it. Go away!
it was nothing.
go on now.
what was it? - Nothing.
what time is it? 8: 10. Let's get dressed.
for what?
for what?
the Corniches are coming to dinner.
that's right. I wasn't thinking.
come give me a kiss.
you don't think I'm silly?
go get dressed.
may I serve, monsieur? - I should think so!
you're late, my friend.
you must be punctual around here.
God, how easy it is to take advantage.
why did he say that?
he himself told me never to serve before 8: 15.
maybe he's in a bad mood.
what? - Listen...
in bed for the night? - Come now.
Madame wants this tablecloth. - Fine.
I'll give you a hand.
very kind of you.
what's wrong? - What's wrong?
it's not in the middle.
it almost is. - Oh, sure. A little more.
Almost"! That's just like you.
almost good, almost straight.
that's good enough for you, but not for me.
you're so fussy.
no, I just like to do a good job.
and if you did your job better, you'd like it more too.
that's the thanks I get?
I didn't ask for your help.
you can be so unpleasant.
I just don't like how you act.
the way I act? - Yes.
I don't like people making fun of their employers.
I really hate it.
we can't all share your feelings for madame.
what's that supposed to mean?
you don't understand? - No, I don't.
and I don't wish to.
you don't say. - I do say.
you know what else?
stop grinning. - Or what?
or you'll have me to deal with.
for three or four days now, you've both been laughing when you look at me...
and I'm just about fed up.
you might ask why I laugh.
I'm not interested. - You should be.
not knowing won't kill me.
it might help you. - Then it's just my bad luck.
if you're not curious, you mind if I am for a moment?
who could stop you?
I have just one question. - Ask away.
it's a simple detail:
do you ever remember your dreams during the day?
remember my dreams? Sometimes.
then you must have quite a time!
sorry?
nothing... I mean, why did you ask me that?
for four nights you've woken me up with moans and cries that leave no doubt as to the nature of your dreams or the identity of the person they involve.
Oh, no need to blush so.
I'm not being mean.
I'm telling you in case you'd like to keep everyone else from knowing.
stop shouting.
architects who build villas don't think about these things, so be careful.
why did you wait four days to tell me?
the second day, I wanted to see if it would happen again.
by the third day it was getting monotonous, and the fourth day I told you.
don't look so upset.
don't be so nervous.
look at your fork.
first of all, it's not your fault.
maybe it's just a little outburst that lasts a few days.
don't give it too much importance.
dreams are just dreams.
dreams and lies," as they say.
but I was curious what they might mean, so I went to the newsstand to buy The Key to Dreams, but they said you'd bought the last one.
you carry it on you? Let me borrow it.
why not? - I can't leave it around.
I won't. Lend it to me. - Keep it hidden.
did what I tell you bother you?
no, what bothers me is that you overheard.
afraid I'll tell madame?
you wouldn't do something that low.
but if you heard me, maybe they did too.
or maybe they'll hear me tonight.
I'm sure it'll happen again now that we've talked about it.
imagine if they hear me shouting "Odette"!
no, you shout "madame.
in the third person? Almost as bad.
I don't dare go to bed. I don't dare sleep!
you mustn't get so worked up.
keep something else in mind.
Oh God, what now?
just because I hear you doesn't mean they do.
a floor is thicker than a wall.
shall you and I do something while they have their coffee?
you and me? Yes, that might help.
not that!
you go to your room, and I'll go to madame's.
we can't do anything that way.
you speak loudly, and I'll see if I can hear.
Oh, I thought... - Yes, that's a good idea.
see, I'm not so horrible after all. - It's true.
friends? - Friends!
now set the table. You're late.
it's true. I still have to dress.
and now the salt shakers.
and toothpicks.
Yes, one per mouth, right?
tell me...
are you sweet on her?
don't be silly!
then why do you dream about her?
you can't choose your dreams.
sure, but they usually come from things we think about during the day.
not on your life!
what does the book say? - Pure rubbish.
now...
the flowers...
and we're done.
there you go again. Listen, don't breathe a word.
I swear. But listen. - What?
admit you're in love with her.
you're jealous.
what?
I don't go for valets.
then we'll get along fine. I don't go for maids.
erotic dreams always...
what are you reading?
nothing, monsieur.
that's not your book, is it? - No, sir.
then leave it there.
odette, what time does the clock up there say?
0. 00590277777777778
if Corniche is at the club, when will we ever eat?
sorry? - It doesn't matter!
what?
nothing!
if it's that hard to hear from one floor to another, all's well.
I'm ready.
Oh, what a pretty dress!
you really like it?
it's ravishing.
the neckline isn't indecently low?
not low enough.
Oh, darling!
don't you think I look like a married woman?
Yes, too much. - Why too much?
I don't see the point. - Come now.
don't you like having a lady friend so chic that no man would dare be disrespectful?
of course.
what was the name of that actress in the green dress this afternoon?
she has a certain style.
yes... like a circus horse.
I hope I'm better than her. - Don't be silly.
and better than Madeleine too. - Madeleine who?
the maid. - Why do you say that?
I think you like her. - Me?
don't tell me I dreamed about her!
no, but you said she was pretty.
I don't recall, but since it means nothing at all,
I'll say that she is pleasing to the eye.
would you marry a woman of her appearance?
I've never had any intention of marrying Madeleine.
or anyone else, for that matter...
including me.
especially not you. - Why?
I love you too much for that. - What does that mean?
simply this...
they're here. 8: 40 isn't bad.
Oh no! I think she came alone.
she did. She came alone.
I can't stand it when he does this.
one doesn't send one's handicapped wife ahead like a scouting party.
we invite her because of him.
he may be a big shot, but he'll always be a boor.
and she's a pain in the neck. - Unbearable.
Oh, here she is!
my dear friend!
shall we sit for a moment?
you can serve now. - I heard.
Thanks. - Don't mention it.
shall I open the door? - Please.
I didn't dare ask.
dinner is served, madame.
after you, my dear.
the fact your husband couldn't drag himself away from baccarat is no reason for us to eat burnt saddle of lamb.
what did she say? - Nothing at all.
have a seat.
she didn't hear me?
I spoke loudly. - Apparently not loudly enough.
shall I sit here? - Yes.
and that's your husband's place.
Ah, my husband's place.
she heard!
let's hope it keeps up.
there's no soup.
Oh yes, I'd love a scoop.
that didn't last long. - This is exhausting.
anyway, she can see there's no soup.
I love lobster. - It's langoustine.
Yes, probably. Too bad, eh?
what did she think you said? - I don't care.
corniche will pay for this.
you don't send a deaf woman to dinner alone.
don't you think she's getting worse?
it's the sea air. - Possibly.
still, it's a frightful feeling to talk in front of her without including her.
she's used to it.
look at her. She doesn't care.
she eats enough for four instead.
very good!
good Lord, she frightened me!
why is she shouting? - Because she's deaf.
so tender! - Who?
the langoustine, of course.
serves him right. - The langoustine again?
he won't get any.
and she's dim-witted too.
her poor husband!
fished this morning.
your husband went fishing this morning?
no, the lobster. I'm sure it was caught today.
I hope so. - It smells of the sea.
it can hardly smell of eucalyptus.
better than in Paris.
no, I don't know what his share is.
a lost cause.
just give up.
may I offer a bit of advice?
Madame shouldn't shout. It's pointless and exhausting.
I had a relative who was deaf like this poor lady.
you won't get through like that.
you must speak quite softly but articulate well.
the lady will be able to read
Madame's lips, and monsieur's lips too, of course.
or if madame insists on shouting, do so in her ear.
like this, for instance.
veuve Clicquot? - Please.
does madame see?
serve quickly to cut this short.
like in a train station diner. I understand, sir.
pardon?
why is she speaking so softly now?
same reason.
she can't hear and doesn't realize it.
I didn't hear what you said.
Ah, so you're a little deaf too.
perhaps. How charming.
but it's true that if we articulate, she understands.
but you don't need to talk like this with me.
you're right. Sorry.
what were you saying?
I said your new valet is very good.
now he knows.
9: 15. - What time is it?
I can't see.
and she's shortsighted too.
9: 15. He must be losing a lot.
doesn't his firm feel that in his situation, an executive is wrong to play for such high stakes?
no, on the contrary.
he plays with his company's blessing.
he keeps his winnings, and 2l3 of his losses come from the advertising budget.
actually, these long silences are quite pleasant.
we can catch our breath.
do you play baccarat? - No, madame, never.
sorry, sir.
of course not. He's a minister.
I play the horses. - Horses are better.
man's noblest conquest.
that's what my doctor said.
while your valet is out of the room...
he's right there.
shall I leave, madame? - No, stay.
fine. Shall I skip the Russian salad too?
you'd have to remove the menu. - It's right in front of her.
would madame point at something outside?
how lovely! - My word!
I thought it was my husband. - No, the moon.
that's not the same thing!
I don't care about her, but aren't you cold in that dress?
no, but I would like my scarf.
I'll get it.
here you are, madame.
I almost put my foot in it.
I'd have felt awful.
I think you've found a gem there.
as attentive as he is attractive.
he arranged your scarf so gently. He seems to adore you!
listen to this amusing story.
your valet made me think of it.
do you know a certain crazy Russian woman,
countess Diepchinska?
I've heard the name.
her maid is my cook's sister, and she told me a hilarious story that took place about two weeks ago.
what are you looking for?
the bell.
so he can hear this? - So he'll finish serving.
aren't you listening? - Yes.
anyway, this countess had a valet like yours, from what I was told.
one evening...
you may serve. - Yes, madame.
no cheese for the lady either? - That's right.
sorry I'm late. Shameful, I know.
sorry, but you know how gamblers are.
did you win? - Yes, one million.
I should call the casino to see if he's still there.
he's right there.
he's right here.
well? - I lost.
how much? - 100, 000.
good evening.
Hello, my dear minister.
have you eaten? - I have.
that can't be true. - More or less.
I had a dozen sandwiches, but I didn't have dessert, so I'd love some of that ice cream, and coffee, of course.
how did it go?
as it always does.
do you have a toothache? - No, it's so she can't read my lips.
at 8: 00, I was down two million.
at 8: 45, I was breaking even.
twenty minutes later,
I was winning one million on three bancos.
so you won more than a million? - No...
because then I played a banco for 120, 000 at the next table and lost.
so you won 880, 000.
no, because at another table I bought a hand at 60, 000
that went round twice.
her dress is ravishing.
telephone, sir.
no, the minister. - Who is it?
your private secretary. - What now?
I'm coming.
I know what it's about. - What?
the cabinet resigned an hour ago.
sorry.
I heard at the casino, but I thought his secretary should tell him.
what's going on? - Back to work.
shall I lie or tell her the truth? - Come now.
here we go.
you know that France is a republic for the time being.
well, the present government has just fallen.
in other words, the cabinet is resigning.
and Monsieur Montignac? - Out on his ear.
Madame, may I ask why you look so lovely tonight?
Montignac is a lucky fellow. Are those eyes really yours?
do compliments bother you?
it depends on what they are and from whom.
will madame have coffee here? - Yes. All right?
as long as we have it together.
what?
did you see your valet's face?
that man is jealous.
if he's supposed to watch over you, beware!
he was incensed by my compliments.
what a notion.
but that won't stop me from saying...
that I've never seen you as gorgeous as tonight.
as if you did it on purpose. - Meaning?
well, let's just call it a coincidence.
what about her? - She can do without.
friends, I have upsetting news.
the cabinet is resigning.
you knew?
I heard at the club. - He told me all about it.
Delplanque resigned without telling us first.
I find that scandalous. Whom does he take me for?
I'm calling him to tell him what I think.
three or four of us were in his way, so he's forming a new cabinet with his own incompetents.
the Lisieux office doesn't accept calls after 10: 00.
you tell them it's from the minister of communications, and that I'll sack them all if I don't get through.
a minister has to be tactful, but they better watch out now.
my friend, I won't try to advise you, but here's what I'd do. - What's that?
here's what I'd do.
I'd take the 10: 50 train.
I'd storm in to see Delplanque, who wouldn't be expecting me.
the telephone's no good. - You're right.
cancel the call. - I'd like to slap that woman!
I'll change and be right back. - Yes, do that.
the poor boy's upset.
between you and me, he's the cause of all this.
he's made mistakes that have put Delplanque in an awkward situation.
or so I heard at the club.
look at the pretty newspaper!
he won't be a minister for long.
we're talking politics!
may I give you my honest opinion?
go ahead. - That boy needs a rest.
you know Egypt?
I hear it's lovely. - I'm sure.
the million I won tonight...
come spend it with me in Egypt. It would take about two months.
what do you say?
I knew you were crazy and ill-mannered, but to ask that of your friend's girlfriend, and in front of your wife!
I'll do anything for love.
I wouldn't brag about it.
then it's no?
very well.
I'm on a lucky streak and have no mistress, and since I'm crazy about you, I wanted you to benefit too.
pardon me, but do I look like a prostitute?
you? Never.
do you imagine
I'd offer a prostitute a million francs to come to Egypt?
Never! I hate prostitutes!
it's precisely because you look like a woman of breeding that I'd offer such a preposterous sum.
women will never understand us.
and you think men understand us?
I look like a woman of breeding, so you treat me like a prostitute?
very odd indeed!
0. 0072337962962963
no, we're off! I'm taking you.
I forgot that the 11: 10 train is a local.
you wouldn't be in Paris before 6: 00.
but my car, which does 75, can get us there by 1: 00 a. m. but we have to leave this instant!
then let's!
we're going? Where to now?
it's a surprise!
darling, I'll be back for lunch tomorrow.
you're not taking me? - What for?
quick, give me a kiss.
darling, don't leave me all alone.
be reasonable and think of my situation.
see you tomorrow.
start the car!
say something sweet before you go.
Montignac! - Coming.
you coming? - One second.
if I'm no longer a minister,
I'll marry you.
now that's something!
don't worry. She loves the foldaway seat.
what's going on, madame?
Monsieur was abruptly called to Paris.
he'll be back for lunch tomorrow.
is the minister really resigning?
poor country.
so monsieur won't be a minister anymore?
I hope not.
you never know. Will madame be going out?
no, I'm going right to bed.
come help me undress.
my God, to think a man would be such a boor.
I wanted to go out tonight, but I certainly can't now.
I couldn't leave her alone.
if anything happened to her, I'd feel horrible.
want a hand?
that's very kind of you.
you want a hand?
I'd love one. Most kind.
take that one, please.
listen...
did you hear what he told her?
I didn't. Did you? We can't help you.
I heard. - Then tell us.
if I'm no longer a minister, I'll marry you.
it's true.
look at that. He didn't make a mess.
he didn't eat, that's why.
her little crumbs...
you going out tonight?
I might step outside for a smoke.
take the key to the back door.
no, you can lock that. I'll use that door.
one other thing.
if you wake me up again...
just bang on the wall to wake me up too.
got it. Good night.
good night. - Is this my tip?
Thanks. - Don't mention it.
Madame is down here? - What are you doing in my room?
but madame...
Madame is down here?
how long have you been here?
let me see.
it's 3: 10 now. Since about 11: 30.
11: 30?
about 15 minutes after madame went to bed.
went to bed here?
no.
didn't madame go up after monsieur left?
then I tidied up and went outside for 15 minutes for a smoke.
then I decided to lie down in here, and I fell asleep. - You didn't turn on a lamp?
you didn't know I was here? - Certainly not, madame.
I would never sleep in the same room as madame.
but is madame sure she was here before me?
I'm positive.
from my room I saw you go out into the garden first.
then I did come in after madame.
my apologies, madame.
why didn't you sleep in your own room?
I don't know. No reason.
you sleep down here often?
no, madame. This is the first time.
what woke you up?
it felt like someone was calling me in my sleep. - Calling you?
by name?
but when you woke up, you realized you were mistaken.
once I woke up,
I heard nothing more.
well, I think you should go up to bed now.
surely madame doesn't mean to spend the night here?
I might.
Madame mustn't. The nights are cold.
it'll be very cold in here in an hour.
it's unwise. I'll stay down here instead.
I get up in a few hours anyway.
besides, tongues would wag if they heard madame slept in the sitting room.
we can both go back to our own rooms.
there's no reason either of us has to sleep down here.
indeed.
see you tomorrow.
what do you mean, no?
no, madame must allow me to say adieu. - Now?
I'll be gone when madame awakes tomorrow.
why are you leaving like this?
for what reason?
Madame mustn't ask questions.
if only madame had said adieu without asking questions.
why spoil the beautiful thing she did?
what beautiful thing?
Madame doesn't realize what she said to me?
no, I don't see what I could have possibly said.
all the better.
it's flattering that madame would unwittingly trust me with such a secret.
a secret? I haven't trusted you with any secret.
Madame's behavior is certainly curious.
does madame think I'm stupid?
that she can address me like a man one moment and a servant the next?
when I said I awoke thinking I'd heard my name,
Madame didn't ask if I realized I'd been mistaken.
I certainly did.
no, madame didn't ask me... - she told me.
when you woke up, you realized you were mistaken.
Madame gave me the answer.
and madame, as if still partially in her dream, trusted me, and that touched me so.
Madame must let me leave with that impression and not suddenly turn distrustful now that she's fully awake.
after all that, how can madame ask why I'm leaving?
Madame knows perfectly well, just like she knows we can never discuss it.
Madame must realize there's something between us now that nothing can erase.
Madame mustn't believe that servants don't understand.
however great the distance between two people, they're not so very different.
hold two hands close or far away...
they're still just like each other.
Madame asks why I'm leaving?
to keep the vow I made the night madame so kindly hired me.
I told madame that night she'd never need to fear me.
to give madame even greater confidence,
I even said that her beauty did nothing for me.
but now I'm not so certain I can keep my word.
I wasn't very sure a few minutes ago, and now I'm not sure at all.
things have gone on these last few days.
I made two mistakes. Madame's eyes that first night should have put me on my guard.
I shouldn't have tempted the devil by insisting she hire me.
my second blunder was to say I wasn't attracted to madame.
one must never say that.
the mere fact one says it proves it isn't entirely true.
it haunts one's mind. One wonders if it's really true.
so one does experiments.
no, I didn't watch madame through the keyhole, but from my window I watched her in the garden.
I observed her shoulders and hands at dinner, and her legs and ankles as she got in the car.
and it was such a good feeling those first days!
so good that I felt cured. I was so happy.
because I must confess, I was very scared of myself and anxious about taking this position.
because there was something I dared not reveal, but I'll reveal it now:
what I did with the countess, I'd done twice before.
Yes, the countess was the third.
the whole week before I took this position,
I wasn't attracted to any woman I saw out and about, and I thought if I was only attracted to my employers, then I was doomed.
imagine, a servant who is still fairly young, attracted only to his employers, whom he cannot love.
one must have this job in one's blood to understand how tragic that is, because I love my job, madame.
I heard monsieur speak once of the thrill of giving orders, but if madame only knew what bliss it is to obey!
to serve is a marvelous thing!
free to have no will of one's own.
open the door." "Close the window.
all other people's ideas.
and if it's a woman's voice, with a slightly stern tone, it's a delicious feeling!
how I envied the slaves!
that was the situation I was in after three days.
I did my job, and madame said nothing... - marvelous!
then, the third night, everything changed!
I start to dream about madame. Yes, me too!
a dream where nothing's forbidden, where everything happens the way it should.
next day, same thing. It's been four nights of torture.
I came down here so madame wouldn't hear me, because it seems I talked in my sleep too.
so I fall asleep and wake up, and what do I see?
Madame, sleeping in the same room, spending the night with me, as it were, calling for me, dreaming the same dream.
and madame asks why I must leave?
I won't ask anymore.
Madame thinks I should have held my tongue.
I spoke because of madame, but madame doesn't understand.
how could she?
has an employer ever understood a servant?
after a week with an employer, we know all their faults.
after a month, we can read their thoughts.
but even after five years' service, an employer knows nothing of us.
only when we leave do they even think to ask us our last names.
many of them would be amazed to learn what we know about them.
so madame, before I leave, may I give madame my opinion and advice?
Madame shouldn't seek to marry monsieur.
Madame would be lost married to a man like that.
Monsieur is a minister. Madame must never forget that.
he feels pressured by his colleagues to have a mistress.
if he married madame, there'd be another in her place.
Madame doesn't know that world like I do.
politicians are almost all from the provinces.
they try to look more Parisian by taking mistresses.
Oh, and madame should go back to acting.
an actress is flattering for a man.
doesn't madame listen to monsieur?
you'd think one only heard properly through closed doors.
1899/12/31 0: 04: 00
the sky's already growing light.
Madame will be very tired tomorrow, and it's my fault. Forgive me, madame.
let us come to an agreement.
when Madeleine awakes,
I'll tell her my mother is ill and that I'm leaving for Lyon.
I'll write to madame in two days, and madame will kindly send a reference written entirely in her own hand.
I'll show it to no one.
I'll guard it with great care as a memory of madame.
would madame say my name?
it's not such a nice name, but madame says it so nicely.
if you do, it's over with us.
Hey, Rocco, you forgot to tell me I needed a corkscrew.
[Doorbell ringing]
it's open!
she's here.
can't I just dig it out with a knife or hammer it in there or something?
take a deep breath and suck it out.
and go buy yourself a corkscrew.
you know, fuck you. You're a real big help, Rocco.
[Music playing on stereo]
hello. Hi.
how you doing, Leticia? Good.
wow, you have a beautiful place.
thank you, you know, I try.
Oh, my God, you really do cook.
I told you, I'm practically a gourmet chef.
you know, I worked in class "A" joints as a kid.
Sauté, soufflé, over easy, double-boil. I can do all that stuff.
wow, I'm so impressed.
[Laughing]
you didn't make any of this.
what are you talking about?
everything is in the wrong pots. The stove is ice-cold.
well, the stove is broken.
so I had to go over to my neighbor's house and use his.
you're lying to me again.
what are you doing? What is this?
what is this? And this? It's from...
lies. Lies. Lies.
you're a professional liar, huh? No, I just, you know...
Yeah, I think you are. You're a liar.
malo.
you don't wanna know.
we got mixed company, trust me. We wanna know, really.
all right.
making love with a skinny woman that's like having sex with a pair of elbows.
[grunting]
you need cushion for the pushin'!
early-bird Earl don't want your worm.
I want the whole damn apple, baby. And you might have it.
we need to talk.
you ladies mind excusing us?
I told him. I told him, "lf you start..."
now, we agreed you gonna stay east of Lenox Avenue.
now, my people are telling me you got your boys all over Fifth.
that would be east. It's too close.
I'm losing money.
move all your guys to Madison.
I want the whole area between Madison and Lenox empty.
that's not really the deal we made. We?
I ain't make shit with you, motherfucker.
brother relax.
you come in next week, we'll work something out.
first of all, I ain't your motherfucking brother.
and there ain't gonna be no next week unless we work this shit out now. Right now.
Nicky,you don't think it's a little out of line you rolling in here like this while we're out with our ladies?
and now what, you wanna start making threats?
who the fuck do you think you talking to?
threats, I'll show you threats.
forget it. Forget it, Earl.
what's the difference, man? We gonna move all our guys to Madison.
now hold the fuck up.
you making decisions for me and Rocco now? We work for you?
Nicky, just give me a minute, all right?
one minute.
I'll tell you what the fuck is right.
what's right is what we all three agree on together. Now, you know that.
I agree. But that kind of macho shit don't fly with what we got here.
we can't go to war with this guy.
finished our little meeting?
Yeah, we cool.
we cool.
all right.
6: 30 at night and you ain't left the house yet?
what you got on, boy? You look like you pump gas for a living.
I gave you money for clothes, didn't l?
[Doorbell buzzing] You went and spent it on liquor and chicks, right?
you give this shit out on the streets? That's what you do?
anybody home? We're back here, man.
this what you're doing?
check it out, Carlito.
mama don't want Revolutionary Reggie in her home no more.
so now I'm stuck with his dusty ass.
I'll get my own place. Yeah, with what?
[Laughs]
lend me some money, big bro. You got enough.
yesterday I asked him to run some number slips for Clyde.
where are the number slips, huh? Where are the number slips, Reggie?
still with Clyde? Still with Clyde.
now that's an easy fucking job.
I mean, motherfuckers lined up for that job.
then let one of them do it.
I've had my spot in Barbados over a year now.
ain't been there but one time.
we work hard, Earl.
I'm getting out the dope business, Carlito.
got a kid on the way. Getting married.
Yeah, motherfucker.
things gonna be different now. Come on, Hollywood Nicky got 20 kids.
houses in Europe, Hawaii. That ain't me.
governor Rockefeller, he putting some new laws on the books.
gonna come down heavy on dope.
ain't gonna be no five, out in three for good behavior.
gonna be 25, 35, life.
we made plenty of money doing this shit, Carlito.
it's time we get out.
man, I tried other things.
I mean, junk's the only thing that ever worked for me.
what about my policy business?
numbers? Yeah.
shit, I could never deal with them digits every day. I'll teach you.
runners robbing you. Bookkeeping.
that shit's for accountants, motherfuckers like you. It's safe. That's what it is.
listen, do me a favor with Reggie.
spend a little time with him. He ain't listening to me. I'm his brother.
you hang out with him, become his friend, maybe something rubs off.
teach him how to dress right, you know, command some respect.
maybe then he can work with me. Take over.
motherfucker.
you gonna move to Barbados.
you do something for me with Reggie.
he's a fuckup, but he's a smart kid. He just needs direction.
and he ain't taking it from his brother.
I ain't see no black folk working in here.
I was wondering if we was allowed to shop here.
you are here.
this the first time you ever fit a black man for a suit?
cool threads, Carlito. Don't know what to say.
how about "thanks"? Yeah,but you didn't work for the bread you paid for all this.
sucked it out of some poor motherfucker's arm.
[sighing]
you two, Earl, you're all the fucking same.
social parasites with no awareness of the changes taking place.
see, minorities trying to catch up and you motherfuckers going around hustling your own people.
there ain't gonna be no hustlers when the revolution comes.
revolution.
they all gonna get lined up against the wall with all the other oppressors.
oppressors.
[Laughing]
you ain't had an oppressed day in your life, Reggie.
Earl's numbers sent you to private school, a year of college.
you got food, clothes. Look at this. Moms owns a two-family house.
don't go badmouthing your brother.
you been sucking his titty your whole life.
Carlito, I would like you to meet my mother.
[Speaking Spanish]
my sister-in-law, Angelita.
pleasure to meet you.
this is my father, and my brother, Sigfredo.
Mmm.
this food is fantastic. Best dinner I've had in,I don't know, my whole life.
[Laughing] Gracias.
Oye, Carlito, how is your business with the musicians? Long hours?
we stay out late, that's for sure.
and a guy like Machito, he don't like going home after the show.
so you got to entertain him till like 6: 00 in the morning.
Machito? Machito?
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cruz. Next time Machito's at the Palladium...
I'm getting you all your own table right next to the stage. My guests.
that would be my husband's dream.
thank you.
don't thank me. I'm gonna make you take out Machito all night after the show.
like that, I can go home and get some sleep.
Oye, Leticia, what I tell you? One day you gonna meet the right kind of man.
you know, I never get to shop in the neighborhood no more.
your pops always had that wheelchair?
he was in a car accident two years ago.
how long everybody live here?
ever since the accident.
I had to leave college to run the business.
you know, my friend, Rocco, he's like my brother.
his family owns a whole string of buildings over on Second.
he can probably set your folks up with like a nice two or three-bedroom for next to nothing.
matter of fact, it would be nothing.
you'd still be right near the bodega.
we get by just fine without handouts.
Sigfredo, you got five people in two rooms with one toilet.
that ain't no handout. It'd be a favor.
Rocco owes me.
besides, maybe you can do something for me someday.
Yeah, like what? Take out Machito?
or cook dinner for Tito Puente? Huh?
I know who you are, Carlito Brigante.
Droguero.
you think you own this neighborhood.
and that all the hard-working people, they belong to you, but no.
all you own is the junkies.
you got it all wrong, Sigfredo.
people like you are the reason why everyone thinks that Puerto Ricans are a race of criminals.
all I'm trying to do is help you out, Sigfredo.
then I want you to go in the back and take a look at my sister.
cause she comes from a good family.
then I want you to leave and you'll never see her again. You understand me?
Yeah, well, unless you got some proof that says Leticia's a minor...
I'm gonna keep on seeing her. No, you will not.
besides your pops digs me.
who knows? Maybe he wants a successful son in the family.
[Speaking Spanish]
you get out of here, you hear me? You stay away from my sister.
you stay away from my family! You understand me?
you stay away from him. You understand?
he's the devil.
I kept it going with Leticia. But quiet.
too bad I ain't the marrying kind.
I'd have loved to see Leticia's brother moping around the wedding with half the gangsters in New York making toasts to me.
you don't have to keep working at Saso's joint anymore checking coats.
I'll take care of you. Carlito, I take care of myself.
[Music playing]
Mmm-mmm-mmm!
[Laughing]
compliments of Mr. Bottolota. Thank you.
you are beautiful.
Yes.
[Laughing] You want a black man to fuck you, baby?
I got $300 if you fuck me, baby. Come on, what's up?
you better straighten this kid out, Carlito.
brother can't get no action in here? What kind of shit is that?
you can't be banging broads at the table, Reggie.
I know they got a backroom.
Yeah. But you got to play it cool. Joint's got a liquor license.
anybody around here could be a cop.
listen, little while, we'll talk to the manager, slip him some cash and you go downstairs and have a good time.
Hey, Artie, Hey, Carlito. How are you doing?
thanks for the drink. You kidding me?
we ain't seen this much money since Prohibition.
you know, in that case I was thinking maybe...
I could be the first Puerto Rican made guy.
Hey, you never know.
Hey, Artie, this is Earl's kid brother, Reggie. Nice to meet you.
Earl's done good by us. Real good.
Earl was doing fine without you.
Carlito, you don't train your pet nigger before you let him out of the house?
why don't you go fuck your dead mother?
Artie.
fuck.
motherfucker!
[grunting]
Hey, tough guy Reggie, you're a big shot.
[People clamoring]
take it easy. Relax.
I'll kill you, you nigger. I'll fucking kill you.
please, everybody, just calm down. Please, relax. Calm down.
can I get somebody in here to help with this here?
relax. Just relax. Relax.
ladies, keep dancing. Smiles, ladies, smiles.
let me just clean this up. Can I have someone in here, please?
I'll help you. Just one minute. That's fine.
[Panting]
Hey, Jerry.
listen, do me a favor.
send a dozen bottles of the best champagne over to Artie's table.
let me have the whole check.
also, see if you can get ahold of Rocco, tell him to get his ass over here. It's an emergency.
you got it, Carlito. Thank you.
[inaudible]
fuck me.
come here, baby. Reggie gonna show you something.
drop dead.
let's get the fuck out of here. Reggie.
being here is the only reason why you're not full of bullet holes.
we're gonna wait for Artie and his boys to split.
we're gonna make a move out the back.
that could take an hour, two hours, or three fucking days.
but we ain't moving from this spot till they gone.
you got to take a leak, do it in that fucking glass.
I got a piece right in my sock, waste all them guinea motherfuckers.
Hey, Reggie, your brother, me, and Rocco, we're in business with those guys. Deep.
you were way out of line.
motherfucker called me a nigger and I'm out of line?
you wouldn't shake the man's hand, Reggie.
he sends champagne, comes over to your table, you treat him like a fucking hump.
for 30 years, man, we've been at war in Harlem, blacks, Ricans and ltalians.
so here, me, Rocco, and Earl put something together and you want to mess it all up? That ain't right.
what do you think you doing?
putting up schools and nursing homes?
you motherfuckers are heroin dealers.
Reggie, time to make a move.
come on. All right, all right.
where are we going? Yo, go back and get that chick.
[Laughing]
Oh, lookie who's here!
Carlito, you buy us all those drinks.
you ain't got to leave out the back door.
Reggie fucked up, all right. I apologize.
you ain't got to answer to us. He does.
what are you doing? Get the fuck off.
what do we got here? Little black motherfucker.
we're gonna let you go, Carlito. But first you gonna watch this.
Artie, that's Earl's brother, Artie.
well, Earl's brother just said his last words.
cause I'm gonna cut his fucking tongue out. You can't do that, Artie.
open his mouth.
[Groaning]
Artie! Fuck my mother?
huh?
you spit in my face?
who the fuck are you?
[Screaming]
Artie!
[Car tires screeching]
[Car door closing] Artie! Wait!
[Reggie panting]
let him go. All right, he's a piece of shit, but let us take care of him.
look, you know how much money we're gonna lose without Earl?
don't wreck our business over this.
you better fucking take care of this, Rocco. You understand me?
you better fucking take care of this.
let's go.
[men mumbling]
[Reggie coughing]
[Panting]
he just went at it with Artie. Over nothing.
[siren wailing]
they would've killed him.
who am I gonna leave my policy business to?
Clyde's your copilot.
Clyde ain't family. Yeah, who is?
you two family. Charlie doesn't want it.
you give it to me, Artie gets involved.
you'll never see another nickel.
Clyde's all right, man.
I want to propose a toast to my successor, Clyde.
I've been in business with this man for 12 years,he took over, and now he fired my ass.
cause you come to work late every day.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
and I want to propose another toast to my brothers of other colors, from other mothers, my two best friends in the whole world, Rocco, Carlito...
I love you and I'm gonna miss you.
[People clapping] I'm gonna miss all of you guys.
we're gonna have the wedding right there on the beach.
you two are coming, right? Like we have a choice.
fuck you, man. No, I want you to stay for a while.
it's a whole different vibe, man. I mean, slow, cool.
it's like, peaceful.
forget about it, Earl.
they're sending motherfuckers to the moon.
you don't think they can lock you two up?
Earl, we love you.
but we're not moving to the West lndies with you.
I'll see you on Christmas.
so, what time is your flight? 6: 30.
come on, man, one last drink.
me and the lady gonna stop for breakfast before we get on the flight.
breakfast? You just had dinner.
catch you at the beach, man.
Rocco.
get out of here, man.
[Car engine starting]
what do you think?
if you was me, would you throw in the towel and follow Earl down to paradise?
Yes. And I would take me with you.
I'd take you, too.
can't a man have a quiet drink in this motherfucker without you pushing a mop in his face?
fuck!
Charlie, if you don't mind, we'll drop Leticia off at home, you can get Reggie out of here.
you got it.
now that Earl's gone, you make sure we never see him again.
you know, ain't got nobody to blame but yourself that Earl passed you up.
you could've had the whole policy bank but you just wouldn't straighten your ass out.
fuck Earl and fuck you!
y'all ain't nothing but Rocco's niggers.
know what, Reggie? Walk your ass home.
it's freezing out here, man.
hop the bus.
you hung around close to a year, you ain't learned shit, you made no friends, no contacts.
all you do is go to black pride meetings, drink all night, and chase whores.
last time I checked, Malcolm X was a Muslim scholar.
no pork, no booze, no pussy.
prayed five times a day and wore a bow tie.
you don't know nothing about me.
a punk is a fucking punk, Reggie, black, white, Puerto Rican or Chinese.
the only reason why you're allowed to walk the streets is your brother.
he's gone now.
so you better go home, lock yourself in, and stay there.
I'm gonna tune you up one day, Carlito.
one day? Why wait, motherfucker?
if you're gonna make a move, make a move right now.
walk, Reggie.
cause next time I see you, it's gonna be bad.
[Car door opening]
[Car door closing]
[Car engine starting]
come on, Eddie. You can't shut down early on me.
it's 5: 30 in the morning, Carlito.
where you gotta go? Your wife can't stand your ass.
Yeah, yeah. Come on, have a drink with me. I'm buying.
why do you always do this to me, Carlito?
come on, Eddie. You know how much I love you.
when I die, I'm gonna leave you everything.
[gun firing]
[Groaning]
[gasping]
I warned you to stay away from my sister, Carlito.
all right? I warned you.
Oh, shit. Carlito!
somebody shot Carlito.
[respirator whistling]
[clanking]
we were successful in removing both bullets.
Mr. Brigante was lucky. No vital organs were damaged.
listen, Doc, if you need any more of my blood, I'm ready.
we're okay.
[Laughs]
can I talk to you for a second?
it's probably not a good idea for you to be here. All right?
I'll call you when Charlie wants to see you.
[sobbing]
private room. Not too shabby.
[whistling]
you must have 99 lives.
what can I do for you gentlemen?
tell you the truth we came by to see if there's anything we could do for you.
maybe let you flip through some mug shots.
I didn't even see the guy.
snuck up from behind me. Next thing I know, bang-bang.
must have been after my wallet.
we figured your goombah pals might have been getting sick and tired of whacking up all those dividends.
[sighing]
we're gonna make a little deal with you, Carlito.
you give us Artie Bottolota, his son, your little buddy Rocco, and the rest of the Pleasant Avenue crew and we won't start breaking your balls on a daily basis.
you got nothing to break my balls about.
I'm in the music business, fellas.
Carlito Brigante is a taxpaying citizen just like everybody else.
every jackass in East Harlem is stumbling around trying to suck his own dick on account of what you and your pals are putting on the street.
now, for old times' sake, we gonna let you grab your little piggy bank and fly away somewhere.
but you are gonna hand us everybody.
otherwise, you're going down with them.
feel better.
Hey, Carlito, you mind if I bring these home for my wife?
it's our anniversary. Knock yourself out.
[Mrs. Diaz speaking Spanish]
Carlito, please!
I beg you. Nobody is gonna get hurt.
Carlito. It's all right.
you know, if you had a brain in your head, you would've took off and gone back to Puerto Rico already.
some hotshot off the street gonna come in here think he doing me a favor and light this joint up.
everybody gotta split town.
buy the ticket. Catch that plane, and never come back.
otherwise your parents gonna be using that money for your funeral.
[siren wailing]
I'm staying here, Carlito. No.
you're going with them.
you got to take care of your pops. No.
in a while we get back together. No.
you have to go, all right?
it's not safe for you here.
every day, I want you to remember one thing:
you still alive 'cause of me.
you call and let me have your address when you get settled.
I'll come down and see you.
do you promise?
of course.
[sobbing] I love you, Carlito.
I love you, too.
[sighing]
no, Leticia.
no, Leticia, no!
[crying]
[Speaking Spanish]
[Screaming]
get in the trunk, you fat fuck.
Hey, I got a gun on you, motherfucker. All right.
what the fuck
[Groaning]
[All grunting]
Hey, Artie, take a look at this.
[Grunts]
[Panting]
Artie, you forgot to take out the goddamn garbage. Artie.
Hey, hey!
what the fuck are you doing? Get off him!
Hey! Artie. Artie! Artie!
[trunk slamming]
[Car engine starting]
[tires screeching]
[Doorbell ringing]
anything new?
how do we know it was Reggie?
Artie's wife said three black guys snatched him.
that don't mean nothing.
I listened in on the ransom call. It was him.
anybody besides you figure that out?
when Artie comes home they will.
[Scoffs]
maybe we get lucky, Reggie buries him in a fucking ditch.
[Clears throat]
how you doing, Artie?
we paid the money. $2 million cash over an hour ago.
I made the drop. No tail. No stakeout.
we did exactly what they said.
you think they'd kill my son?
no, no, Artie. Why would they do that?
[clock ticking]
[sighing]
[Phone ringing]
hello.
we finished counting all the cash.
good. I wanted you to have it with no problems.
it's $20 short.
huh?
so fuck you very much.
I'm killing this guinea cocksucker.
wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[gun firing]
[SCREAMS]
wait! What happened?
[Woman crying]
[Laughing]
[grunting]
[Panting]
april fools', motherfucker.
[sobbing]
I don't know if I can do this funeral without a body.
you need a body? I'll get you a body.
[banging on door]
[Woman sniffling]
Artie boy.
[exclaims]
[Laughing]
[All laughing]
you guys must have prayed hard for us.
I never thought I'd live to see old man Bottolota throw a hug around this Puerto Rican.
it was about two minutes before the other shoe came crashing down like a safe.
you motherfuckers was in on it.
Artie, Charlie wouldn't be here if that were true.
you shut your mouth, Rocco!
if we was in on it, we would have had Reggie kill you, don't you think?
they left me there to suffocate in that fucking trunk!
if the cops didn't drive by, I'd still be in there turning fucking blue!
enough!
maybe you was in on it, maybe you wasn't.
but Rocco brought you around us and then the both of you brought those fucking niggers around.
so you're responsible.
I'm putting Nacho Reyes on you.
worked with me in Cuba. Did more hits than all my guys together.
I'm giving him contracts on you, Rocco, and Earl.
and the only way they're gonna be canceled is if I find three dead niggers on my doorstep.
and my $2 million back in my pocket.
[speaks Spanish]
[Music playing on radio]
[sighing]
how is the food in this joint?
this is a bar. They don't got food here.
I'm talking to you, pendejo?
I'm fucking talking to you?
[inhaling]
[snorting]
Carlito.
I got a contract to kill you.
I don't want to do that.
so we...
we gonna go, we gonna find those three fucking cocolo, okay?
[Speaking Spanish]
nacho Reyes.
first-degree stone killer from them old Batistá days.
nacho got himself a bad blow habit.
he only worked two hours a day.
nacho, I don't want them in the car.
rest of the time it's all party and poontang.
man, you think I cover for that crazy fucking kid?
him come for me next.
Reggie was asked to leave our organization months ago.
he wanted to bomb police stations.
that's not what this movement's about.
we're about spreading progressive education for the uninformed not resorting to methods of violence. Why don't you come inside?
come on, come on. Let's go have a fucking drink already.
at the rate we're going...
Reggie and his boys gonna die of old age.
and me and Rocco a lot sooner.
don't touch the car, please.
don't touch me. Don't be touching my shit.
Nicky, I'd never bother you with something like this but if we don't find them cats soon, them crazy-ass ltalians are gonna come over and start shooting up the black side of Harlem.
[Laughs]
Carlito.
you don't find the motherfuckers that snatched Artie's kid, you the one that's getting shot up.
Yeah, well that, too.
and far as them ltalians coming my way, if one of them even set foot across Lenox Avenue, next time you're gonna see a live guinea again is on the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
now I believe I've been very nice about this situation.
I let you and them set up across town from me.
I appreciate that.
because one day you and them wal-yos, you're gonna run out of dope.
and all them junkie motherfuckers you all done raised gonna come scurrying over to me like a bunch of starved cockroaches.
if we run out of dope, you run out of dope, too, Nicky.
I got me a safe house with over 3 tons of pure Persian.
that's enough to keep this city nodding for the next six months.
are a bunch of cracker-ass scumbags.
I'm gonna wear my best tux to those motherfuckers' funerals.
Nicky...
but I'm gonna do this for you, Carlito. And you gonna owe me.
I appreciate it.
you know, Nicky, l...
you have the most beautiful automobile I've seen in my life.
if I can just drive the car one time around the block, papi, man, it would mean the world to me.
[snorting]
class-a Bolivian, man. Blow the fur right out that coat.
Carlito. How you doing?
there's two fuckup kids, never had a dime between them, now they're throwing parties and driving new cars on 137th Street.
what's the address? Address?
you don't need an address.
I got them both in the trunk of my car.
[chattering in Spanish]
[Music playing]
[grunting]
Hey.
[Shad and Lee screaming]
come on, let's go.
[snorting]
guys telling me Reggie took off to Barbados to see his brother.
that's bullshit.
that kid ain't getting through customs with $2 million in cash.
no way, no how.
Mira, he got some girlfriend, lives in the Bronx.
21 Collins Avenue, Apartment 3A.
time to hit the Bronx.
time to drop off these guys to Artie first. Vamos.
you want to see something nice, Carlito?
here's your guy. Here's your guy, too. Carlito, take your guy.
here's some more of your guy.
come on.
[whooping]
[Nacho talking in Spanish]
did you see Artie's face when he opened the first bag, Carlito?
[Laughing]
Hey, Carlito, I ain't never gonna eat in that fucking joint again.
come on, let's go, Nacho. Nacho, come on.
here we go.
[guns cocking]
Earl, what the...
now you know I ain't had nothing to do with this bullshit.
Reggie called me talking about he want to come down to the island and hide out...
I took the first plane smoking. There's my ticket.
I landed this morning.
Carlito, don't listen to that fucking cocolo.
shut the fuck up.
Reggie, where's the money? Fuck you.
Where's the money?
Reggie, tell them where the fucking money is.
just give it up and we'll let you walk.
nobody lettin' nobody walk.
[Nacho shouting in Spanish]
Reggie, there's six guys downstairs.
you kill us, you still ain't making it out this building.
tell me where the money is, we'll cook up a story for Artie and let you go.
Reggie, listen to him. This is your last out.
I'm supposed to believe that shit? Listen to him!
I'm trying to help you out, Reggie. Fuck you, Carlito.
you said next time you see me gonna be bad.
you shouldn't have come looking then, because you dying first.
Reggie! Reggie!
[gun firing]
Earl.
just let me be, man, let me be.
come on, Carlito.
let's take this cocolo and put him on the meat hook.
he'll tell us where the money is.
he don't know where the money is, Nacho.
on the meat hook he will know.
he don't know nothing about no money, all right?
just tell Artie Earl never showed up.
you know I can't do that, Carlito.
walk away, Nacho! Just walk the fuck away!
Papito, don't forget, I got a contract for you, too.
kill me then. Kill us both.
if that's what I have to do, that's what I have to do.
well then, come on, motherfucker!
you want to go to hell? Let's all three go to fucking hell!
pull the fucking trigger!
[sighing]
Carlito, Carlito.
you listen to Nacho.
this loyalty that you have for your friends, it's rare in this business.
but someday it's gonna get you killed.
Adios, Carlito.
Adios.
ain't nobody gonna find that money.
Reggie got it buried someplace.
you gotta get on the plane with me.
I do that, they kill Rocco-- They'll kill you and Rocco, whether you give them the $2 million or not, you know that.
we all got to get on that fucking plane.
Rocco's got family here.
running gonna buy us some time but it ain't gonna buy us forever.
I do not give a shit if you knock over Fort Knox.
if I don't get my $2 million back before the week's out, your testicles are gonna be jammed in your eye sockets.
you get that? In your fucking eye sockets!
how much you got stashed, Charlie? A little over $500, 000.
all right, I got $600, 000.
suppose we throw it together and make $1 million down payment to Artie tell him we'll get him the rest.
I wouldn't give Artie Bottolota a nickel for a fucking parking meter.
he should've kept his $2 mil, let Reggie whack Artie Jr.
like that there'd be one less scumbag hanging off the Bottolota family tree.
that's real insightful, Charlie. I'll let him know.
where you going? Someplace I can think.
make out my will.
now you figure, why not just whack Artie and his boys?
kill one of them wiseguys, gotta kill a hundred.
they just keep coming after you.
got to come up with that $2 mil, Jack.
$30 million? That's wholesale.
you start cutting the shit up, it's worth 10 times that. Maybe more.
you're gonna bring down Hollywood Nicky?
look, he's got 3 tons of pure uncut heroin stashed in his safe house.
Charlie, nobody knows where that is. I do.
Yeah, how's that? Earl told me a while back.
Earl?
you're trading tips from the nigger that probably ended up with my $2 million?
you know something, Carlito? Suck on this!
pops! Hold on!
listen. We clean out Hollywood Nicky, that's the end of his business.
all them junkies come running over to you, Artie. You'll be the kingpin.
now you want to start a 10-year war between us and the blacks.
the ltalians ain't taking down Hollywood Nicky.
the Puerto Ricans are.
it's not a bad idea, Pop.
you don't like the idea, pull the trigger.
you ain't never gonna see your money again.
okay, now. The cut dope goes out in laundry trucks every day.
the new dope goes in the same way twice a week.
Tuesdays and Fridays. Noon sharp.
we gonna boost one of the delivery trucks like half a mile from here.
we're gonna whack the driver and make the delivery.
only instead of 50 keys of junk it's gonna be me, Colorado and about 20 other guys.
there's just five armed guards that work inside that place. They're all relatives.
people Hollywood Nicky trusts.
all we gotta do is kill them all and take it all.
so, what do you think?
what do I think?
make the score.
should have been here two hours ago.
Yeah. That's 'cause Hollywood Nicky's throwing dirt over him by now.
now you can take care of the $2 million on your own.
[truck horn honking]
[gate opening]
that's some good shit.
Attaboy. You did great.
our cut should be half of what's there. Half?
you can have the whole thing. At wholesale.
$10, 000 a key.
[Laughing]
Artie, you got to be kidding me.
fuck you. Fuck you.
you two work for us.
get the spic squad in gear and start moving all that shit.
see you later, fellas.
[Laughing]
okay. To us. We're gonna be rich, Pop.
we're gonna be...
[crashing]
what the fuck is that? Motherfucker.
it's Hollywood Nicky!
[guns firing]
what the hell was that? I don't know.
[police radio chattering]
[police siren wailing]
you want to go back? Are you crazy? Let's get out of here.
[sighing]
what's going on, fellas?
thought I had a flat.
it don't look flat.
heard on the radio they just found your boys up the road in that meatpacking house with about 10, 000 pounds of heroin.
they arrest wouldn't come everybody? Peacefully.
now they're all getting measured for rubber bags.
mind if I check your trunk? Be my guest.
what's this?
it's a whole lot of money.
$200, 000. $100, 000 in each bag.
[Grunts]
pleasure doing business with you, Carlito. Pleasure was all mine.
good luck, fellas.
you son of a bitch.
why, thank you, gentlemen.
no prisoners on this one, Jack. Just corpses.
[Chuckling]
you son of a bitch.
come on, Rocco, it's not like we turned into stools.
what? You ain't got a problem with us hiring a couple of cops to do a little killing on our behalf, do you?
$200, 000? That's a world record ever paid for a hit.
[All laughing]
let's get the fuck out of here.
big Jeff and Little Jeff wound up with a chest full of medals for taking out the whole Bottolota crew.
and the big war between Hollywood Nicky and the Puerto Ricans never got declared.
me and Earl went to Nicky at the get-go, told him my idea.
cause all we handed to over to Artie and his boys were 20 pounds of heroin sprinkled over the top of 5, 980 pounds of baby laxative.
but the guys who check the evidence aren't real big connoisseurs of dope.
they just clock what's on the scale.
I sure hope nobody tries getting high off that shit.
they'll have to cook up a whole kilo just to catch a buzz.
I dig that idea so much...
I ain't even gonna charge you for the 20 pounds of real dope.
out of sight, baby.
just call it my contribution to a planetary improvement.
we appreciate it.
you're not getting into my car with that fried fish.
I'm just gonna keep it for later.
you're not getting in the car with that stinking-ass fish.
come on, I got to go home and get changed.
move your fat ass.
Hey, guys. Y'all want to go to the fight tonight? Ringside.
maybe next time.
Hey, Nicky, thanks for everything.
anytime, baby.
you know I got low blood sugar, man.
I gotta eat a lot of meals. Get your ass in the car.
we did it. No, you did it.
being retired, I had a lot of time on my hands.
so Earl dragged me down to Barbados help him get ready for his wedding.
over here.
this is gonna be the ceremony right here. Come on, Earl.
you're gonna have me and Rocco stand on the beach all day in tuxedos?
what are you complaining about? Come here.
Earl's right. It's paradise down here.
only one thing missing.
maybe it's time for me to do like Earl. Shake loose.
no more walking on the wild side for me, Jack.
Carlito. I done changed.
reformed. Retired my ass to paradise.
Yeah, baby.
paradise.
only thing gonna drive me crazy is never knowing what happened with Artie's $2 million.
when you got them hanging on the meat hook, they tell you everything.
[Music playing]
Roberta's mad at me. Sweetheart, can you feel it?
I'm not mad.
I just wonder, with only two days left, this is the most optimal use of your time, especially since we're missing vital one-on-one interface - with the swing voters at the Faneuil hall event... - Roberta
Roberta, plenty of time for all that.
we'll just be here 20 minutes.
then we'll need to get you straight down to the harbor for the EPA announcement, which will have crews from every local station.
cable news?
probably make tomorrow's "Globe" above the fold.
so 20 minutes, right?
Yes. 20 minutes.
you know, that's another thing. Who the hell is Alan Shore?
Hello, Samantha. - Alan.
hello. - Pleasure.
do you get any sleep at all?
Yes, about three hours a night.
20 minutes.
Jack, don't you think I should be part of the meeting?
no, Samantha and I will take this one alone.
Oh.
the accusations were shocking.
money laundering, tax evasion, obstruction of justice...
the verdict, guilty on all counts.
and now, believe it or not,
Jack Fleming wants to be our next mayor.
ask yourself, would you rather have a candidate with convictions, or a candidate who's been convicted?
paid for by the committee to re-elect mayor Thomas Snyder.
in your defense,
I suppose black and white makes us all look a bit like Moe Howard.
well, it gets me ticked off every time I see the damn thing.
and there's not a word of truth in it.
but apparently, that doesn't matter.
you know what? I've got three Harvard law professors and a former U. S. attorney, on my campaign steering committee, all saying that there is no way that I can get that ad yanked off the air, so...
I doubt if you've got a silver bullet here, Al, no offense.
Alan. None taken.
the ad is completely false.
Jack was never convicted of those charges.
it was a third-generation family real estate trust.
he was a passive beneficiary, a victim of a trustee whose greed got the trust prosecuted, not Jack personally.
I know you can help us.
you should feel flattered, Alan.
my wife seems to hold you in very high esteem.
and I her.
as you know, in college, not a day went by that I didn't long to sleep with you.
I hope I'm not being inappropriate.
as a matter of fact, you are.
then my apologies.
when you sopke of the truth a moment ago
I guess I mistook that as a preference for full disclosure.
uh, boys, we don't have time for this.
Alan, I know it's gonna be tough to get an injunction on this thing...
you've read the First Amendment then.
three days ago, we had a double-digit lead.
then they put this thing on the air, and our overnight polls dropped six points in 72 hours.
if we don't move fast, we're going to lose, all because of this late hit, these lies.
please help us.
let me see if I understand this.
in college, you longed to have sex with her. - Yes.
you ached to feel her naked body pressed up against yours.
Yes, well said.
and yet, nothing between the two of you ever happened.
we suffered from bad timing.
you're wondering if that's our destiny, yours and mine 20 years of unrequited foreplay.
is that what you want?
is that what you want?
well, it just seems that our timing might also... - Mr. Shore...
I saw you in the conference room with Jack Fleming.
what were you two doing?
Tai chi, actually.
I hope it is clear to you that it would be an unacceptable conflict of interest for you to represent Jack Fleming in any matter.
this firm is extremely close to mayor Snyder.
then this firm should take a shower, don't you think?
he is a callous, smug, and brutish man who hates the poor and abuses the powerless.
you're not following me.
we earn a great deal of money working for the city, due primarily to mayor Snyder's goodwill.
one would think that was obvious.
one would.
well...
now I have to take the case.
now, I'm gonna ask you a series of...
Denny Crane.
why did you just say that?
well, isn't that how you guys usually begin a mental status examination, by determining if the subject knows his own name?
well, yes.
Denny Crane.
got it.
and who am I, Mr. Crane?
you are Dr. Thomas H. Lee, neurologist.
good.
can you tell me what day of the week this is? - Monday, and a particularly crisp and beautiful one, too, I might add.
good. And who is the current president of the United states?
that would be Ernest Borgnine.
I'll bet you get lunatics in here every day that say that stuff for real, right?
the current president of the United states is George Walker Bush, son to George Herbert Walker Bush, whose father was the late united states senator Prescott Bush, who was an undergraduate at Yale, once wrestled my father in the nude, but that's a story for another day.
let's stick to the issues at hand.
Denny Crane.
flight risk?
your honor, my client can barely walk.
he weighs 300 pounds and suffers from acute rheumatoid arthritis.
Plus, I think I got a touch of the gout, judge.
I ain't going nowhere.
he was moving at a pretty good clip when he left that jewelry store.
it was a one-time adrenaline rush.
your O. R. motion is denied, miss Colson.
bail set at $50, 000.
we'll take 15, folks.
in this way.
you got a minute?
sure.
I need a good lawyer.
you available?
flattered. What's up?
well, Marcie and I split up.
Yeah, I was so sorry to hear that.
I can recommend somebody, Richard, but I don't do matrimonial work.
no, no, I already found somebody for that part.
there's something else.
five years ago, when my son was born, we saved his umbilical cord blood.
you mean in the delivery room?
right. We got it stored in one of those cryo labs, just in case Zachary ever needs to use it to treat a cancer he develops, god forbid.
welcome to parenting in the new millennium.
anyway, the account, it was opened in Marcie's name.
which, at the time, I didn't think twice about.
but now the lab is saying that makes her the responsible party, not the two of us jointly.
she's refusing to release the cord blood.
she won't let it be used.
your son is sick?
I'm sick.
multiple myeloma.
it was diagnosed six months ago.
Oh, Richard, I...
chemo hasn't worked so far, and they're saying that I need a bone marrow transplant.
but they can't find a suitable donor.
and your son's cord blood would work instead?
they think so.
it's just sitting there in a freezer.
just sitting.
without it, they gave me six months.
maybe.
you think I got a lawsuit?
let's meet with her first, hope we don't have to file.
good. Okay.
Thanks.
and then what happened, Mr. Shrum?
well, when I couldn't get the pop tart out of the toaster,
I unplugged it.
and then I jammed a fork down the slot, and I guess I must've jiggered it around pretty good, because the...
can you give us a moment, please?
mark, what did I tell you about volunteering extraneous information?
not to. - Right.
this is a deposition.
you answer the questions truthfully, but never volunteer anything, so don't add stuff like "jiggering forks around pretty good.
just answer every question with as few words as possible.
got it.
sorry.
all right, Mr. Shrum, when you repeatedly manipulated the fork around in the toaster slot and then received an electrical shock and second-degree burns, whose fault would you say that was?
mine?
uh, I can't answer any shorter. That was one word.
Denny...
we really do need to talk.
the partners are concerned.
about what? - Well, your billables, do you realize that so far this year you have only billed 1400 hours, which is 200 hours less than you had billed up to this point in calendar '03, which was, as you know, a year that saw a marked decline.
breakfast?
I already ate.
in short, Denny, you are coming in light by about $700, 000 a year, which means that, since calendar '99 alone, you have cost us $3. 5 million.
you ever forget things?
things like what?
I don't know, people's names, where you put the car keys, whether or not you showered, what a case you're arguing is all about.
not really.
well, you should get it looked at, just the same.
you could have what is called mild cognitive impairment.
it's a precursor to Alzheimer's.
Denny, you are theoretically our foremost rainmaker, but you haven't brought in a new seven-figure client in two years.
you haven't filed a class action in five years.
care to guess how much Lisby, Derucie & Floren billed as lead counsel in the tobacco class action?
$127 million.
it's raining cashout there, Denny.
we're not getting wet.
you could do crossword puzzles.
excuse me?
it's a great brain stimulator. So is learning new skills.
you know what else helps?
speaking from time to time in a foreign language.
what are you...
doing?
researching a case citation.
have you ever used a computer before?
an entirely new experience.
bottom line, your honor, if Mr. Fleming feels aggrieved by the way he's portrayed in my client's campaign commercials, then let him counter it with commercials of his own.
as justice Brandeis said, "the best antidote to false speech is more speech.
it's not surprising Brandeis would say that.
he was a well-known drunk and pedophile.
no, he wasn't.
that's right. He wasn't.
I made it up.
does anyone have a problem with me making provably false accusations about honorable people, just so my side can win?
because that's certainly their strategy.
he's amazing.
Yes, we're quite fond of him.
Mr. Shore is asking that you impose prior restraint on speech and not just any speech, but the robust dialogue of a political contest.
we don't do that in this country.
if they took a song from the Beatles catalogue and used it in a campaign commercial without permission, would you order the commercial off the air? Of course you would.
it's an absurd analogy, your honor.
what if they ran a campaign commercial with footage of this lovely young woman right here showering, footage secretly taken with a lipstick camera mounted in her health club locker room?
this is ridiculous. - The point is, in all of those cases, we absolutely would see injunctive relief granted because those are rights worth protecting.
and so is the right of Jack Fleming to have the truth told about his life.
but how do we determine the truth, your honor?
would Mr. Shore have us establish a government department of veracity?
Mr. Fleming already has a remedy available.
it's called the slander suit. - I'm curious.
when one wins a slander suit, does the court award votes?
because that's the issue here.
they're trying to cost him the election now even if they have to pay him a few dollars, years from now.
well, this has been fascinating, gentlemen, kinda like debate night at mensa.
Mr. Gelman, that TV spot you're defending is emphatically vile.
but, Mr. Shore, he's right.
political speech is not subject to prior judicial review.
and thank the lord, or that's all I'd ever do.
we're adjourned.
well, that was discouraging.
it was.
I'm sorry.
you tried.
what now?
I'm gonna recommend we do a gang-bang sit down with the four local anchormen.
and obviously, you by Jack's side, doing the whole "stand by your man" thing.
very important when accusations go to character like this, we answer every question, dominate the airwaves.
the message? Our guy is a superior piece of manpower.
feedback? - Sounds good.
that copacetic on your end? - Mm, sure.
copacetic on my end, too.
your end?
got it.
be right back with your coffee.
thank you.
well, we're very grateful that you agreed to meet with us.
did I have a choice? You were pretty insistent on the phone.
sorry, it's just a situation of some urgency, and I know you've said you didn't want to retain counsel, - but I would respectfully suggest... - We've spent enough on lawyers.
we had a five-star divorce, didn't we, Richard?
look, I have to pick up Zach from a play date, so...
well, what I came to say is simple, Marcie.
I'm sick, and I need your help.
I can't let you use Zach's cord blood.
I told you that when you called.
what if he gets sick and needs it himself?
we saved it for a reason.
Marcie, I can certainly understand your feelings, but perhaps...
do you have children, miss Colson?
no.
you want to protect Zach, and I understand that.
but how about protecting him from losing his father?
he's not gonna lose you.
you're strong. You'll beat this.
no, not without a compatible donor.
this isn't some simple transfusion we're talking about.
they need an exact match, and they can't find one.
they've tried, Marcie. Don't you get it?
well, they should keep trying.
but I'm running out of time!
please don't yell at me.
I'm sorry.
I was thinking on the way over here, uh, about the day Zach was born, and holding him and feeling as if I was part of some great continuum.
feeling as if...
it's stupid, but...
feeling as if I had thrown my DNA forward into the future, you know?
like some biological javelin.
he's my flesh and blood, Marcie.
I would never do anything to put him at risk.
I've read all the literature.
I mean, the chances of Zach ever needing to use this are about 1 in 2, 700.
but I need it now...
to live.
I am his flesh and blood, too, Marcie.
please, don't ask me about this again.
either of you.
it's okay.
I understand you provided representation to Jack Fleming after all, contrary to my explicit instructions.
I did.
but please understand, ordinarily, I place great value on all things explicit.
is it your feeling that Denny Crane will protect you from me?
it is.
to the extent that he recalls who I am.
well, perhaps it will jog his memory when I devote a large portion of next month's senior partners' meeting to a discussion of your situation here.
miss Wilson.
was that man threatening you again?
Yes. It seems to be his job description.
cnn said the election was too close to call.
Fleming is up two points, but it's within the margin of error.
I think that's what I'll call my autobiography.
within the margin of error.
will I be in it?
it depends on who ghosts it. I'll certainly lobby on your behalf.
well...
I'll expect a chapter...
minimum.
well, I would imagine you could earn a chapter quite easily...
I was wondering if you could help me with this product liability issue...
never mind.
no, please, I'm all yours.
hardly.
ever used a computer?
Denny!
um... Yes. Yes, I have.
remarkable machine.
let me ask you a question.
a manufacturer of toasters should anticipate that their written safety instructions will be ignored to the extent that they're counter intuitive and should plan for that contingency, right?
in an ideal world.
what are you doing here?
I was afraid you'd hang up if I tried calling you.
can we talk?
I have nothing else to say.
I think I know your secret.
it was only one time.
richard and I just had a huge fight.
I went to spend the weekend at my sister's, and there was a guy there, this houseguest of hers.
we were all drinking wine, and suddenly he and I were alone.
and it just happened.
I agonized about whether or not to have the baby.
and in retrospect, I can't imagine not, you know?
but I promised myself that Richard would never, ever find out.
you can't tell him.
you should tell him.
he deserves to know, especially now.
no, now would be the worst time.
being Zach's father, it's what he lives for.
if you don't tell him, I will.
I'm his attorney. I have an obligation.
just tell him I won't release the cord blood.
tell him to keep trying to find a match.
he needs to keep trying.
if Zachary's blood could save him, of course, I would let him have it.
and it tears me apart that I can't tell him that, but I can't.
how did you figure it out?
occupational hazard.
I watch people's eyes.
when Richard was telling you how he felt the day Zach was born...
promise me you won't tell him.
I have an obligation.
Samantha.
you're wet.
it's raining.
he's screwing her.
that media consultant Roberta...
she left a detailed message on his cell phone.
didn't know I was borrowing it.
come in and get dry.
buy me a drink?
maybe if he had done it with somebody extraordinary.
Roberta, she's...
she's just so...
sufficient.
I'm sorry.
it's fine. This is my regular place.
I bring crying women here all the time.
Oh, really?
well...
I guess I'm that cliche?
the credulous political wife, cheated on, humiliated, didn't see it coming.
I have to do that interview with him tomorrow.
stand by my man.
he doesn't know that I know.
what do I do?
what do you want?
I want out.
guess I am out.
guess I've been out.
I do want him to win the election.
I do. He'd be a great mayor.
he really does care about people.
as long as they're strangers to him.
you really don't like him.
is that why you made that joke in your conference room, when...
when I said not a day in college went by that I didn't long to sleep with you?
Yeah.
it wasn't a joke.
I had a place all picked out back then, a motel out on route 9, the Aloha inn.
I thought you might appreciate the tropical ambience.
I'm imagining a lot of rattan and plastic orchids.
there's a neon sign out front that blinks "Aloha" in orange, then "inn" in pink, then the hula girl's skirt in green, over and over and over.
it sounds lush.
and all night long, the rooms are flooded with the glow of that neon.
and I always wondered how you would look naked in all that...
pink, green, and orange.
Hi. - Hi.
you okay?
I'm gonna see if the candidate can squeeze me in for a moment.
moment of your time?
are you joking? We're about to start.
it's a pressing matter.
perhaps we could duck in there.
you've got 30 seconds.
then I'd better jump right in.
do you have a favorite movie about politics?
mine is "The candidate.
okay, we're done here. - I still have 20 seconds left.
I especially like that scene after Redford wins the election when he asks his top advisor, "Marvin, what do we do now?
goodbye, Mr. Shore.
you're a married man, Jack, having a furtive sexual relationship with your media consultant, which begs the question, "Marvin, what do we do now?
of course, your name isn't Marvin, and Redford had already won.
you, on the other hand, could still lose if anything unpleasant were to come up.
and does she know?
use her name.
does Samantha know?
Samantha knows.
this is a memorandum of agreement.
by all means, read it when you have a free moment.
but I'll need your signature right now, I'm afraid.
so, here are the headlines,
Samantha will do your little dog and pony showout there, and all other events with you from now through the inauguration, should you be lucky enough to have one.
she, of course, smiling at all times, exactly like Pat Nixon.
and in return, after the divorce, she gets a meaningful role in every high-level appointment and major policy initiative during your first term.
she put you here. She's earned it.
I would never, ever give her that.
do you understand?
perfectly.
so, then, we'll handle this transaction in the only currency that's really available to us.
Samantha gets the house in Nantucket, 75% of all funds in the various bank accounts as of close of business yesterday, the mutual funds in their entirety, and 60% of all other assets as determined by the forensic accountants that we will hire, and you will pay for.
Oh.
be sure to date it on the bottom there.
you can't lie to a client.
I know. I told her.
it's just, the news will crush him, Paul.
and to what end? What good will have been done?
he will have been dealt with truthfully by his attorney.
that's the good. - I know all the law school arguments.
let's talk real world here.
okay. Real world?
if I learned that an attorney in this firm knowingly told a lie to a client, a lie central to the matter the client had retained us to handle,
I would personally report it to the ethics committee of the state bar, regardless of whatever respect or affection
I might feel for the attorney in question.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just leaving.
Hey. - Hi.
and thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
I, I know I could have just faxed this over, but I wanted to massage some of the language with you.
clearly, you're gonna be a better judge - on whether the arguments here are too inflammatory. - Richard.
which is the obvious pitfall of filing appellate papers against your ex-wife.
Richard, listen.
I'll just shut up and let you read it. I'm sorry.
look, there's something I need to tell you.
and I don't know how to begin.
you said my client was here, Markhrum?
he was here. Mr. Crane came out to get him.
Denny got him?
I don't understand how Marcie could do this.
she feels deeply ashamed.
but the priority now has to be finding you a suitable donor.
but how could Marcie destroy the cord blood?
it wasn't intentional.
she was having it transferred last week from one lab to another.
I guess she wanted to hide it from you.
there was a shipping glitch.
it went 36 hours without being refrigerated.
she was devastated.
I talked to Denny Crane. He's a trustee of Boston General.
he's having their chief of oncology call you tomorrow.
thank you.
that's very kind.
they'll find you a match. I know they will.
you're gonna get through this.
let's hope.
editors of Times called it obnoxious.
this refusal of mayer Snyder to agree to debate his challenger.
of course, there was one joint campaign appearance, the two candidates sharing the same stage at one point several weeks ago when the Snyder camp called a debate...
feels good, doesn't it?
what feels good?
having sex with the candidate. What if he wins?
I bet the orgasms are even better if he wins.
I'm jealous.
and we're ready to make a call in the race for mayor of Boston.
okay, everybody, this is it!
based on exit polling, we are now projecting that mayor Thomas Snyder has lost his bid...
let's go.
he'll want you downstairs in the ballroom basking in the adulation, part of the deal.
new deal.
this is where I get off.
coming?
but one thing we do know tonight, the Thomas Snyder era is coming to an end.
and Boston's new mayor will be Jack Fleming.
Stan Forrester is standing by at the Fleming victory party at the Hyatt where a very happy crowd is waiting for the mayor-elect and his wife to make their way down to the ballroom.
can you hear me, Stan?
Denny,
I'm worried about you.
you're speaking French to the messengers, you got crossword puzzles spread out all over the conference table, you walk into reception, hijack one of Sally Heep's clients, actually have a meeting with him in your office.
did you even know what his case was about?
I took that test the other day, the one where they ask you a bunch of questions to see if you've turned into an imbecile, and they do a scan of your brain. You know what they found out?
that I have a lot of blue and yellow and red stuff colliding up there.
the damn MRI photo looks like a hurricane.
I don't remember what was the good color and what was the bad color, but the point is this.
they discovered that I remember some things and I forget others.
and that's the way it's gonna be.
you wanna know what that man's case is all about?
he stuck a fork in a toaster.
it's a little pissant lawsuit.
but I remember what you said the other day.
what was that?
seriously, Paul, you have to have that test.
you said that we weren't filing enough class-action suits, that we were missing out on a gold shower.
I, I believe I said a money shower.
when I heard the fact pattern of the Sally Heep case,
I was able to persuade Mr. Shrum that there was a greater good to be achieved.
and long story short, happily, the toaster company was open to my argument.
what argument?
that an attorney...
like Denny Crane with extensive class action experience could easily turn Mr. Shrum's case into a lucrative opportunity.
on the other hand, if they were to give Denny Crane their ongoing legal business, augmenting the fine work done by the in-house counsel, then Denny Crane would be unavailable to represent Mr. Shrum who, incidentally, is going to receive $50, 000 from the company as a goodwill gesture.
so don't you worry too much, Paul, about Denny Crane.
and I also wanna say to my wife Samantha, who unfortunately could not be here tonight, she's a little under the weather.
Samantha, I love you, and I wish you could be right up here beside me right now.
we love her, right?
that's right. Sure we do.
okay.
thank you all. God bless you, Boston.
you did the right thing.
Yes, I did.
I lied to him.
Lori, you realize you have exposed this firm to a potentially enormous liability award and imposed on me certain excruciating ethical obligations?
you'll do the right thing, too.
# At last... #
# My love has come along #
# My lonely days are over #
# And life is like a song #
# Ooh...#
# At last... #
# The skies above are blue #
# My heart was wrapped in clover #
we should have done this much sooner.
let's do it again.
Charles, you have finally lost your senses.
this venture is impossible.
for some. Gentlemen, the only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible.
that kind of thinking could ruin you.
I'm willing to take that chance.
imagine trading posts in Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...
the nightmare again?
I won't be long.
I'm falling down a dark hole, then I see strange creatures.
what kind of creatures?
well, there's a dodo bird, a rabbit in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.
I didn't know cats could smile.
neither did I.
and there's a blue caterpillar.
blue caterpillar.
hmm.
do you think I've gone round the bend?
I'm afraid so. You're mad, bonkers, off your head.
but I'll tell you a secret. All the best people are.
it's only a dream, Alice. Nothing can harm you there.
but if you get too frightened, you can always wake up. Like this.
Ow!
must we go?
doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.
they will notice.
Where's your corset?
and no stockings.
I'm against them.
but you're not properly dressed.
who's to say what is proper?
what if it was agreed that "proper" was wearing a codfish on your head?
would you wear it? - Alice.
to me, a corset is like a codfish.
please, not today.
father would have laughed.
I'm sorry. I'm tired. I didn't sleep well last night.
did you have bad dreams again?
only one.
it's always the same, ever since I can remember.
do you think that's normal?
don't most people have different dreams?
I don't know.
there. You're beautiful.
now, can you manage a smile?
at last. We thought you'd never arrive.
Alice, Hamish is waiting to dance with you. Go.
you do realize it's well past 4: 00.
now everything will have to be rushed through.
I am sorry. - Oh, never mind!
forgive my wife. She's been planning this affair for over 20 years.
if only Charles were here...
my condolences.
I think of your husband often. He was truly a man of vision.
I hope you don't think I've taken advantage of your misfortunes.
of course not. I'm pleased that you purchased the company.
I was a fool for not investing in his mad venture when I had the chance.
Charles thought so, too.
Hamish, do you ever tired of quadrille?
on the contrary. I find it invigorating.
do I amuse you?
no.
I had a sudden vision of all the ladies in trousers and the men wearing dresses.
I think you'll do best to keep your visions to yourself.
when in doubt, remain silent.
pardon us, sir. Miss Kingsleigh is distracted today.
Where's your head?
I was wondering what it would be like to fly.
why would you spend your time thinking about such an impossible thing?
why wouldn't I?
my father said he sometimes believed in six impossible things before breakfast.
come along.
Alice, meet me under the gazebo in precisely 10 minutes.
we have a secret to tell you.
if you're telling me, then it's not much of a secret.
perhaps we shouldn't. - We decided we should.
if we tell her, she won't be surprised.
will you be surprised? - Not if you tell me.
but now you've brought it up, you have to.
no, we don't. - In fact, we won't.
I wonder if your mother knows that you two swim naked in the Havershims' pond.
you wouldn't. - Oh, but I would.
there's your mother right now.
Hamish is going to ask for your hand.
you've ruined the surprise!
I could strangle them!
everyone went to so much effort to keep the secret.
does everyone know?
it's why they've all come. This is your engagement party.
Hamish will ask you under the gazebo. When you say yes...
but I don't know if I want to marry Hamish.
who, then? You won't do better than a lord.
you'll soon be 20, Alice. That pretty face won't last forever.
you don't want to end up like Aunt Imogene.
and you don't want to be a burden on Mother, do you?
no.
so you'll marry Hamish.
you will be as happy as I am with Lowell, and your life will be perfect.
it's already decided.
Alice, dear.
I'll leave you to it.
shall we take a leisurely stroll through the garden, just you and me?
do you know what I've always dreaded?
the decline of the aristocracy?
ugly grandchildren. But you're lovely.
you're bound to produce little... Imbeciles!
the gardeners have planted white roses when I specifically asked for red.
you could always paint the roses red.
what an odd thing to say.
you should know that my son has extremely delicate digestion.
did you see that? - See what?
it was a rabbit, I think. - Nasty things.
I do enjoy setting the dogs on them.
if you serve Hamish the wrong foods, he could get a blockage.
did you see it that time?
see what? - The rabbit.
don't shout.
now, pay attention. Hamish said you were easily distracted.
what was I saying? - Hamish has a blockage.
I couldn't be more interested, but you'll have to excuse me.
aunt Imogene.
I think I'm going mad. I keep seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat.
I can't be bothered with your fancy rabbit now.
I'm waiting for my fiancé.
you have a fiancé? - Hmm.
there! Did you see it?
he's a prince.
but, alas, he cannot marry me unless he renounces his throne.
it's tragic, isn't it?
very.
lowell?
Alice. We were just...
hattie's an old friend.
I can see you're very close.
look, you won't mention this to your sister, will you?
I don't know. I'm confused. I need time to think.
well, think about Margaret. She'd never trust me again.
you don't want to ruin her marriage, do you?
me?
but I'm not the one who's sneaking around behind her back.
there you are.
Alice Kingsleigh...
Hamish.
what is it?
you have a caterpillar on your shoulder.
EW.
don't hurt it.
you'll want to wash that finger.
Alice Kingsleigh, will you be my wife?
well, everyone expects me to, and you're a lord.
my face won't last, and I don't want to end up like...
but this is happening so quickly. I...
I think I...
I think I...
I need a moment.
hello.
it's only a dream.
you'd think she would remember all this from the first time.
you've brought the wrong Alice.
no, she's the right one. I'm certain of it.
she's the wrong Alice.
give her a chance.
curiouser and curiouser.
I told you she's the right Alice.
I am not convinced.
how is that for gratitude?
I've been up there for weeks, trailing one Alice after the next, and I was almost eaten by other animals.
can you imagine?
they go about entirely unclothed, and they do their shukrn in public.
I had to avert my eyes. - Doesn't look anything like herself.
that's because she's the wrong Alice.
if she was, she might be. - If she isn't, she ain't.
but if she were so, she would be. - But she isn't, nohow.
how can I be the wrong Alice when this is my dream?
and who are you, if I might ask?
Oh, I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.
contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum, he's Tweedledee.
we should consult Absolem.
exactly. Absolem will know who she is.
I'll escort you. - Hey, it's not being your turn.
so unfair.
Hey, leave off! - Let go!
are they always this way? - Family trait.
you can both escort her.
who is this Absolem? - He's wise. He's absolute.
he's Absolem.
who are you?
Absolem?
you're not Absolem, I'm Absolem. The question is, who are you?
Alice.
we shall see.
what do you mean by that? I ought to know who I am.
Yes, you ought, stupid girl. Unroll the Oraculum.
the Oraculum, being a calendrical compendium of Underland.
it's a calendar.
compendium.
it tells of each and every day since the Beginning.
today is Griblig Day in the time of the Red Queen.
show her the Frabjous Day.
Mmm. Yeah, Frabjous being the day you slay the Jabberwocky.
sorry? Slay a what?
Oh, yeah. That being you, there, with the Vorpal sword.
no other swords can kill the Jabberwocky, nohow.
if it ain't Vorpal, it ain't dead.
that's not me!
I know!
resolve this for us, Absolem. Is she the right Alice?
not hardly.
I told you.
Oh, dear.
I said so. - I said so.
contrariwise, you said she might be.
no, you said she would be if she was.
little impostor. Pretending to be Alice. She should be ashamed.
I was so certain of you.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be the wrong Alice.
wait, this is my dream.
I'm going to wake up now and you'll all disappear.
that's odd. Pinching usually does the trick.
I could stick you, if that would help.
it might, actually. Thank you. - My pleasure.
Ow!
Bandersnatch! - Bandersnatch!
wait.
it's only a dream. Nothing can hurt me.
what's she doing?
can't hurt me. Can't hurt me.
run, you great lug!
this way, east to Queast.
no, south to Snud.
no. No, no. This way.
someone has stolen three of my tarts!
did you steal them? - No, Your Majesty.
did you? - No, Your Majesty.
did you steal them? - No, Your Majesty.
did you steal my tarts?
no, Your Majesty.
it's cranberry juice.
I was so hungry! I didn't mean to! - Off with his head!
my family! Oh, please, please don't!
No! I have little ones to look after!
go to his house and collect the little ones.
I love tadpoles on toast almost as much as I love caviar.
Yes, Your Majesty.
drink!
Majesty?
Ilosovic Stayne, you knave, where have you been lurking?
Majesty, I have found the Oraculum.
that? Looks so ordinary for an oracle.
look here, on the Frabjous Day.
I'd know that tangled mess of hair anywhere.
is it Alice?
I believe it is.
what's she doing with my darling Jabberwocky?
she appears to be slaying it.
she killed my Jabber-baby-wocky?
not yet, but it will happen if we don't stop her.
find Alice, Stayne. Find her!
find the scent of human girl and earn your freedom.
for my wife and pups, as well?
everyone will go home.
dogs will believe anything.
it looks like you ran afoul of something with wicked claws.
and I'm still dreaming.
what did that to you?
banner or Bander... - The Bandersnatch?
well, I'd better have a look.
what are you doing?
it needs to be purified by someone with evaporating skills, or it will fester and putrefy.
I'd rather you didn't. I'll be fine as soon as I wake up.
at least let me bind it for you.
what do you call yourself? - Alice.
the Alice?
there's been some debate about that. - I never get involved in politics.
you'd best be on your way.
what way? All I want to do is wake up from this dream.
fine.
then I'll take you to the Hare and the Hatter, but that's the end of it.
coming?
watch what you're doing!
Hey, watch it!
okay, okay. All right.
it's you.
no, it's not. McTwisp brought us the wrong Alice.
it's the wrong Alice!
it's absolutely Alice.
you're absolutely Alice. I'd know you anywhere.
I'd know him anywhere.
well, as you can see, we're still having tea.
and it's all because I was obliged to kill Time waiting for your return.
you're terribly late, you know. Naughty.
well, anyway, Time became quite offended and stopped altogether.
not a tick ever since.
cup. - Time can be funny in dreams.
Yes, yes, of course, but now you're back, you see, and we need to get on to the Frabjous Day.
Frabjous Day! - Frabjous Day!
I'm investigating things that begin with the letter "M.
have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid! - Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
what? - Down with the Bloody Big Head, the Bloody Big Head being the Red Queen.
come, come. We simply must commence with the slaying and such.
therefore, it is high time to forgive and forget or forget and forgive, whichever comes first or is, in any case, most convenient. I'm waiting.
Hey. It's tick-tick... It's ticking again.
all this talk of blood and slaying has put me off my tea.
Ah.
the entire world is falling to ruin and poor Chessur's off his tea.
what happened that day was not my fault.
Oh, dear.
you ran out on them to save your own skin, you guddler's scuttish pilgar lickering shukm juggling sluking urpal.
bar lom muck egg brimni!
Hatter!
thank you. - Meow.
I'm fine.
what's wrong with you, Tarrant? You used to be the life of the party.
you used to do the best Futterwacken in all of Witzend.
futter what? - Futterwacken!
it's a dance.
on the Frabjous Day, when the White Queen once again wears the crown, on that day, I shall Futterwacken vigorously.
Oh, no.
Uh-oh.
the Knave.
goodbye.
hide her!
drink this quickly.
quick! Hide her!
Oh, dear.
Aye.
mind your head.
let me out!
well, if it's not my favorite trio of lunatics.
would you like to join us?
you're all late for tea!
we're looking for the girl called Alice.
speaking of the Queen, here is a little song we used to sing in her honor.
# Twinkle Twinkle little bat #
# How I wonder where you're at #
# Up a... #
if you're hiding her, you'll lose your heads.
already lost them.
all together now!
# Up above the world you fly #
# Like a tea tray in the sky #
# Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle #
# Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle #
# Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle #
Oh!
Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
would you like some cream?
would you like a slice of Battenberg? - Follow the bloodhound.
sugar? - Yes, please.
Oh, that's lovely. - You're all mad.
thanks very much.
pass the scones, please.
Oh! Pardon.
one moment.
there. Yes.
try this on for size.
Oh.
I like it.
good thing the bloodhound is one of us, or you'd be...
what do they want with me?
wait a minute, best take her to the White Queen.
she'll be safe there. Spoon...
your carriage, milady.
the hat? - Of course.
anyone can go by horse or rail, but the absolute best way to travel is by hat. Have I made a rhyme?
Oh, I love traveling by hat.
mally. Just Alice, please. Fairfarren, all.
what do you mean? Wait. Gae!
twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
all mimsy were the borogoves And the mome raths outgrabe
sorry, what was that?
what was what?
the Jabberwock, with eyes of flame Jaws that bite and claws that catch!
beware the Jabberwock, my son! And the frumious Bandersnatch!
he took his Vorpal sword in hand The Vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
he left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back
it's all about you, you know.
I'm not slaying anything. I don't slay, so put it out of your mind.
mind.
wait! You can't leave me here!
you don't slay.
do you have any idea what the Red Queen has done?
you don't slay.
I couldn't if I wanted to.
you're not the same as you were before.
you were much more muchier. You've lost your muchness.
my "muchness"?
in there. Something's missing.
tell me what Red Queen has done.
it's not a pretty story.
tell me anyway.
it was here.
I was hatter to the White Queen at the time.
Hightopp clan have always been employed at court.
Hatter? Hatter!
I'm fine.
are you?
did you hear that? I'm certain I heard something.
what?
Oh! Red Knights.
go south to Trotter's Bottom.
the White Queen's castle is just beyond.
hold on tightly.
down with the bloody Red Queen!
you were supposed to lead them away! The Hatter trusted you!
they have my wife and pups.
what's your name? - Bayard.
Sit!
would your name be Alice, by any chance?
Yes, but I'm not the one that everyone's talking about.
the Hatter would not have given himself up just for any Alice.
where did they take him?
to the Red Queen's castle at Salazen Grum.
we're going to rescue him.
that is not foretold.
I don't care. He wouldn't be there if it weren't for me.
the Frabjous Day is almost upon us.
you must prepare to meet the Jabberwocky.
from the moment I fell down that rabbit hole,
I've been told what I must do and who I must be.
I've been shrunk, stretched, scratched and stuffed into a teapot.
I've been accused of being Alice and of not being Alice, but this is my dream.
I'll decide where it goes from here.
if you diverge from the path...
I make the path.
take me to Salazen Grum, Bayard, and don't forget the hat.
there's only one way across.
lost my muchness, have I?
Bayard! The hat!
your Majesty.
so sorry.
splendid shot!
Where's my ball? Page!
Yes, Your Majesty.
I want to help you.
well, if it isn't the wrong Alice.
what brings you here? Mmm?
I've come to rescue the Hatter.
you're not rescuing anyone being the size of a gerbil.
well, do you have any more of that cake that made me grow before?
Upelkuchen? Actually, I might have some left.
not all of it!
Oh, no! Stop! No, no, no, don't. Don't do that!
page!
Oh, dear.
and what is this?
it... It's a "who," Majesty. This is, um...
um?
from Umbradge.
what happened to your clothes?
I outgrew them. I've been growing an awful lot lately.
I tower over everyone in Umbradge. They laugh at me.
so I've come to you, hoping you might understand what it's like.
my dear girl, anyone with a head that large is welcome in my court.
someone find her some clothes!
use the curtains if you must, but clothe this enormous girl.
I need a pig here!
I love a warm pig belly for my aching feet.
would you like one, Um? - No, thank you.
Sit!
Sit!
go away.
where are my fat boys? You must meet them.
fat boys!
Oh. There they are. Aren't they adorable?
they have the oddest way of speaking. Speak, boys. Amuse us.
go on.
no.
speak!
is that being... - No, no, it isn't. Not a bit. No.
contrariwise, I believe it's so.
no, it ain't so, nohow!
I love my fat boys. Now, get out.
he did pinch me. - He did pinch me.
and who is this lovely creature?
um, my new favorite.
well, does she have a name? - Um.
I believe your name has slipped the Queen's mind.
her name is Um, idiot!
from Umbradge.
any luck with the prisoner?
he's stubborn.
you're too soft. Bring him!
we know Alice has returned to Underland.
do you know where she is?
I've been considering things that begin with the letter "M
moron, mutiny, murder, malice.
we're looking for an "A" word now. Where is Alice?
who, that wee little boy? I wouldn't know.
what if I take off your head? Will you know then?
stop that.
what a regrettably large head you have.
I should very much like to hat it.
hat it? - Yes.
I used to hat the White Queen, you know.
wasn't very much to work with, poor dear.
her head is so small.
it's tiny. It's a pimple of a head.
but this...
what I could do with this monument, this orb...
nay, this magnificently heroic globe.
what could you do?
unbind him, Stayne.
how can he work if his hands are bound?
well, then, shall it be a bonnet or a boater?
or something for the boudoir?
Cloche, dunce hat, death cap, coif, snood, barboosh, pugree, yarmulke, cockle hat, porkpie, tam o'shanter, billycock, bicorne, tricorne, bandeau, bongrace, fan-tail, night cap, garibaldi, fez...
Hatter.
fez?
leave us.
the trees seem sad.
have you been speaking with them? - Yes, Your Majesty.
perhaps a bit more kindly.
would you all excuse me for a moment? Thank you.
what news, Bayard? - Alice has returned to Underland.
where is she now? - In Salazen Grum.
forgive me. I allowed her to divert from her destined path.
no, no, no, no. But that is exactly where she will find the Vorpal sword.
we have our champion. Rest now. You've done well.
have you seen a hat around here?
you must find Alice, Stayne.
without the Jabberwocky, my sister's followers will surely rise against me.
ugly little sister. Why do they adore her and not me?
I cannot fathom it. You are far superior in all ways.
I know.
but Mirana can make anyone fall in love with her.
men, women, even the furniture.
even the King?
I had to do it. He would have left me.
Majesty, is it not better to be feared than loved?
not certain anymore.
Oh, let her have the rabble. I don't need them.
I have you.
they're wonderful.
you must let me try one on.
it is good to be working at my trade again.
it's just a pity you have to make them for her.
what is the hatter with me?
Hatter?
Hatter.
have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
I'm frightened, Alice.
I don't like it in here. It's terribly crowded.
have I gone mad?
I'm afraid so. You're entirely bonkers.
but I'll tell you a secret. All the best people are.
here.
that's better. You look yourself again.
hat man! Where are my hats?
I'm not a patient monarch!
I'm told she keeps the Vorpal Sword hidden in the castle.
the rabbit will help you.
find it, Alice. Take it to the White Queen.
we'll go to the White Queen together.
why is it you're always too small or too tall?
Tweedles. - Alice.
how do you do, again? - Where's the rabbit?
how is it you're being so great big?
she ain't great big, this is how she normal is.
I'm certain she's smaller when we met.
no, she drank the pishsalver to get through the door, recall it?
Oh, yeah.
Where's the rabbit? - Over there.
what are you doing here? - I'm rescuing the Hatter.
I'm rescuing the Hatter.
he told me that the Vorpal sword is hidden in the castle. Help me find it.
I don't take orders from big, clumsy, galumphing...
Shoo!
what is it, McTwisp? - I know where the sword is.
the sword's hidden inside.
be careful, Alice.
I know that smell.
I'm not going in there.
look what that thing did to my arm.
dear, oh, dear. Why haven't you mentioned this?
it wasn't this bad before.
Hatter? Where are you?
Hatter?
Mallymkun.
do you still have the Bandersnatch eye?
right here.
I need it. - Come and get it.
Hey! Give it back!
I like you, Um.
I like largeness.
get away from me.
I have your eye.
no.
hmm.
you look stunning in that hat.
Yes. Next.
your Majesty has never looked better.
hmm. Another.
Oh!
I don't wish to alarm you, but it smells as though you might have dropped something.
never mind him, he's mad. Come along.
Stayne!
I suppose this makes us even now.
um forced herself on me.
I told her my heart belongs to you, but she's obsessed with me.
off with her head!
stand back, Mallymkun.
how's this for muchness?
no, no! It mustn't be used for anything...
arrest that girl for unlawful seduction!
Hatter!
take it to the White Queen. - I'm not leaving without you.
go!
run, Alice!
Alice?
run!
seize her.
Alice.
of course. Why didn't I see it?
well, it has been a long time, and you were such a little tyke then.
give me the sword. - Stay back.
the Queen will be so pleased.
she will take great pleasure in taking off your head.
Oh, Alice! - Bayard! To Marmoreal.
Majesty, Alice has escaped on the Bandersnatch, with the Vorpal sword.
how could you let this happen?
I may have underestimated her, but we have her conspirators, the Hatter and a dormouse.
off with their heads!
welcome to Marmoreal.
I believe this belongs to you.
Mmm.
the Vorpal sword is home again.
the armor is complete.
now all we need is a champion.
you're a little taller than I thought you'd be.
blame it on too much upelkuchen.
Oh.
come with me.
is the March Hare here?
you're late for your soup, you wee besom.
you're late for your soup. - Could use some salt.
come here, you!
give me that here. Choppy, chop, chop, chop.
leek and potato. Yes. That would be...
Pishsalver. Let me think.
a pinch of worm fat, urine of the horsefly, buttered fingers.
my sister preferred to study dominion over living things.
tell me, how does she seem to you?
perfectly horrid.
and her head? - Bulbous.
I think she may have some kind of growth in there, something pressing on her brain.
three coins from a dead man's pocket, two teaspoons of wishful thinking.
you can't imagine the things that go on in that place.
Oh, yes, I can.
but when a champion steps forth to slay the Jabberwocky, the people will rise against her.
that should do it.
blow.
feel better? - Much, thank you.
there's someone here who would like to speak with you.
Absolem? - Who are you?
I thought we'd settled this.
I'm Alice, but not that one.
how do you know? - You said so yourself.
I said you were not hardly Alice, but you're much more her now.
in fact, you're almost Alice.
even so,
I couldn't slay the Jabberwocky if my life depended on it.
it will.
so I suggest you keep the Vorpal sword on hand when the Frabjous Day arrives.
you seem so real.
sometimes I forget that this is all a dream.
will you stop doing that?
I've always admired that hat.
Hello, Chess.
since you won't be needing it anymore, would you consider bequeathing it to me?
how dare you?
it is a formal execution. I would like to look my best, you know.
it is a pity about all this.
I was looking forward to seeing you Futterwacken.
I was rather good at it, was I not?
I really do love that hat.
I would wear it to all the finest occasions.
I love a morning execution, don't you?
Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.
I'd like to keep it on. - Suit yourself.
as long as I can get at your neck.
I'm right behind you.
off with his head!
I can't watch.
good morning, everyone.
chess, you dog.
madam, you are being heinously bamboozled by these lickspittle toadies you surround yourselves with.
what is that?
I'm not the only one, Majesty. Look!
a counterfeit nose. You should be ashamed.
me? What about that big belly you're so proud of?
liars! Cheats! Falsifiers!
off with their heads!
the abused and enslaved in the Red Queen's court, all of you stand up and fight!
rise up against the bloody Red Queen.
Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
release the Jubjub Bird!
you're right, Stayne, it is far better to be feared than loved.
come, boys. Quickly! Come on!
Hatter!
come on, Mally, quickly. Come on. Come on.
prepare the Jabberwocky for battle.
we're going to visit my little sister.
I had hoped to have a champion by now.
why don't you slay the Jabberwocky yourself?
you must have the power.
it is against my vows to harm any living creature.
we have company.
have a look, Bayard.
Bielle.
I'm so happy to see you. I thought they were going to...
so did I. But they didn't, and now here I am, still in one piece.
and I'm rather glad about that now that I'm seeing you again.
I would have regretted not seeing you again, especially now that you're you, and the proper size.
and it's a good size. It's a great size. It's a right proper Alice size!
Hatter. - Size. Fez. I'm fine.
Where's your hat?
Mmm.
Cheshire. - How's the arm, love?
all healed.
goodbye, sweet hat.
have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
let me think about it.
you know what tomorrow is, don't you?
Frabjous Day. How could I forget?
wish I'd wake up.
still believe this is a dream, do you? - Of course.
this has all come from my own mind.
which would mean that I'm not real.
afraid so. You're just a figment of my imagination.
I would dream up someone who's half-mad.
Yes, yes. But you would have to be half-mad to dream me up.
I must be, then.
I'll miss you when I wake up.
who will step forth to be champion for the White Queen?
that would be I.
you have very poor evaporating skills. I should be the one.
I'll do it.
no, me. - No, me.
no other slayer, nohow.
if it ain't Alice, it ain't dead.
Alice, you cannot live your life to please others.
the choice must be yours, because when you step out to face that creature, you will step out alone.
nothing was ever accomplished with tears.
Absolem?
why are you upside down?
I've come to the end of this life.
you're going to die? - Transform.
don't go. I need your help. I don't know what to do.
I can't help you if you don't even know who you are, stupid girl.
I'm not stupid.
my name is Alice. I live in London.
I have a mother named Helen and a sister named Margaret.
my father was Charles Kingsleigh.
he had a vision that stretched halfway around the world, and nothing ever stopped him.
I'm his daughter. I'm Alice Kingsleigh.
Alice, at last.
you were just as dim-witted the first time you were here.
you called it "Wonderland," as I recall.
wonderland.
what do you call yourself? - Alice.
the Alice?
then I'll take you to the Hare and the Hatter, but that's the end of it.
she's the right one. I'm certain of it.
Ah, Thackery, not at the table, please.
have some tea.
you're not Absolem, I'm Absolem, stupid girl.
and what is this? - I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.
contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum, he's Tweedledee.
you'd think she would remember all this from the first time.
curiouser and curiouser.
it wasn't a dream at all, it was a memory.
this place is real, and so are you and so is the Hatter.
and the Jabberwocky.
remember, the Vorpal sword knows what it wants.
all you have to do is hold on to it.
Fairfarren, Alice. Perhaps I will see you in another life.
Hello, Iracebeth. - Hello, Mirana.
on this, the Frabjous Day, the Queens Red and White shall send forth their champions to do battle on their behalf.
Oh, Racie. We don't have to fight.
I know what you're doing.
you think you can blink those pretty little eyes and I'll melt, just like Mummy and Daddy did.
please.
No! It is my crown! I am the eldest!
Jabberwocky!
this is impossible.
only if you believe it is.
sometimes I believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
that is an excellent practice.
however, just at the moment, you really might want to focus on the Jabberwocky.
Where's your champion, Sister?
here.
Hello, Um.
six impossible things. Count them, Alice.
one, there's a potion that can make you shrink.
two, and a cake that can make you grow.
so, my old foe, we meet on the battlefield once again.
we've never met.
not you, insignificant bearer.
my ancient enemy, the Vorpal one.
that's enough chatter.
three, animals can talk.
four, Alice, cats can disappear.
five, there's a place called Wonderland.
six,
I can slay the Jabberwocky.
the Hatter's interfering! Off with his head!
off with your head!
kill her!
we follow you no more, Bloody Big Head.
how dare you? Off with his head!
Iracebeth of crims, your crimes against Underland are worthy of death.
however, that is against my vows, therefore, you are banished to the Outlands.
no one is to show you any kindness, or ever speak a word to you.
you will not have a friend in the world.
Majesty, I hope you bear me no ill will.
only this one, Ilosovic Stayne, you are to join Iracebeth in banishment from this day until the end of Underland.
at least we have each other.
Majesty, please! Kill me! Please!
but I do not owe you a kindness.
take off my head! - He tried to kill me.
Majesty! Please! Please! - He tried to kill me.
I offer you my head! - He tried to kill me!
Oh, the Frabjous Day! Callou! Callay!
what is he doing? - Futterwacken.
blood of the Jabberwocky. You have our everlasting gratitude.
and for your efforts on our behalf...
will this take me home? - If that is what you choose.
you could stay.
what an idea. A crazy, mad, wonderful idea.
but I can't.
there are questions I have to answer, things I have to do.
be back again before you know it.
you won't remember me.
of course I will. How could I forget?
Hatter, why is a raven like a writing desk?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Fairfarren, Alice.
she left me standing there without an answer.
a case of nerves, no doubt.
Alice? - Good Lord.
are you all right? - What happened to you?
I fell down a hole and hit my head.
I'm sorry, Hamish. I can't marry you. You're not the right man for me.
and there's that trouble with your digestion.
I love you, Margaret, but this is my life. I'll decide what to do with it.
you're lucky to have my sister for your wife, Lowell, and you be good to her. I'll be watching very closely.
there is no prince, Aunt Imogene.
you need to talk to someone about these delusions.
I happen to love rabbits, especially white ones.
don't worry, mother,
I'll find something useful to do with my life.
you two remind me of some funny boys I met in a dream.
you've left me out. - No, I haven't, sir.
you and I have business to discuss.
shall we speak in the study?
Oh. And one more thing.
my father told me he planned to expand his trade route to Sumatra and Borneo, but I don't think he was looking far enough.
why not go all the way to China?
it's vast, the culture is rich, and we have a foothold in Hong kong
to be the first to trade with China, can you imagine it?
you know, if anybody else had said that to me,
I'd say, "You've lost your senses."
but I've seen that look before.
well, as you're not going to be my daughter-in-law, perhaps you'd consider becoming an apprentice with the company.
Hello, Absolem.
# Tripping out, spinning around #
# I'm underground. I fell down #
# Yeah, I fell down #
# I'm freaking out. So, where am I now? #

# I... I'll get by #
# I... I'll survive #
# When the world's crashing down when I fall and hit the ground #
# I will turn myself around. Don't you try to stop me? #

Prof: Today I want to talk about what I think of as one of the most significant failures of environmental law in the twentieth century.
so what is the plastics problem ?
in part, it's the enormity of the industry.
about 119 billion pounds now produced each year in the United States.
this is roughly about a $400 billion industry.
and I mentioned earlier that just to give you a point of comparison to the pesticide industry, the pesticide industry produces about ten billion pounds.
so it's about ten times smaller than the plastics industry.
and the annual sales from pesticides are about ten to twelve billion dollars per year in the nation.
so compared to the attention that pesticides have been given over the past thirty to forty years, the plastics problem has been just about fully neglected by Congress.
although it did pass the Toxic Substance control act back in 1976.
and this law was intended to encourage premarket testing of chemicals.
and what we'll see today is that the majority of chemicals remain untested, that the ingredients are unlabeled, the country of origin is unknown for most products.
the recovery rate is exceptionally low.
and recycling failure occurs for many reasons, but we'll explore several of those later in the session.
environmental contamination at a global scale has occurred.
there are plastic particles, molecules in ambient air outside and indoors.
plastics have contaminated underground aquifers as well as surface waters in many parts of the industrialized world.
there's been universal human exposure.
that exposure is chronic, you get it on a daily basis.
and the health effects that we now are beginning to understand have to do predominately with endocrine disrupting compounds, chemicals that are mimicking human hormones.
we rely, unfortunately, for the most part on animal studies to give us some insight into what the effects on humans are likely to be.
but we rely on that evidence for many other classes of compounds as well.
so this area has received virtually no attention from the Environmental Protection Agency, and I want to talk a little bit today about why that is.
so 850, 000 people employed in this industry.
that number is now up about $400 billion per year, and plastics comprise seventy percent of the synthetic chemical industry in the nation, including 500 different resins.
plastics labeling is confusing to many people.
you may not look on the bottom of a milk carton or you may not look on the back of many different products to look at the recycling code.
the recycling code in the United States is completely voluntary.
there is no legal obligation to post the chemical content, the origin of the plastics or what should be done with it once the product is discarded.
so, give you an example here.
polyethylene, PET, has the symbol number one.
so bottled drinks such as Pepsi and Coca Cola are packaged in PET.
sometimes it's called PETE, polyethylene.
there's a high-density version of that, which is number two.
and there's a low density version of that, which is number four.
so carrier bags and bin liners, for example, are the low-density polyethylene as opposed to say the gallon milk jugs which are the high-density polyethylene.
the polyethylenes are the most likely to be recycled among all plastics.
polyvinylchloride, by comparison,
pvc for short, is contained in many different products.
water pipes, and I'll show you some examples of that in a few moments.
it's almost never recycled, which means that it's either buried or it's burned once it is finally discarded.
polypropylene, you may find polypropylene in rugs.
you can find it also in margarine tubs, different kinds of food packaging products.
but also in these microwavable meal trays.
polystyrene, most people understand what styrene is.
you are all familiar with styrene balls.
but it's also an absorbent material that's put at the base of meats in packaging.
and I mentioned to you that the packaging problem is, especially related to food, is incredibly complex.
there's no way for you to know what chemicals are in the packaging materials that you buy in the grocery store.
seven is reserved for other kinds of plastic resins.
so only those that do not fall into the other categories are given the number seven.
and we'll concentrate on one of those today, which is called bisphenol-A.
bisphenol-A is what's used to form polycarbonate plastic that's very dense, very hard, and often it's in clear form.
it can be colored.
so Nalgene bottles are a good example of number seven, the polycarbonates.
and also you might think of the headlamps on a car or a motorcycle helmet or a visor.
these are all examples of polycarbonate.
here is a chart that lists the recycling rate in yellow for all the different classifications.
and you basically see PVCs are at the bottom of the list.
so PVCs are not recycled because the chemical content is so complicated.
the highest degree of recycling occurs with the polyethylenes.
so the PETE bottles have roughly a twenty to twenty-five percent recycling rate on average in the United States.
and this is highly variable by region in the nation.
and also by time of the year.
the polypropylene is almost never recycled, nor is polystyrene.
Polycarbonates, the hard plastic composite that exists, for example, in my glasses, these are also almost never recycled.
so what happens to them?
I'm going to take you on a quick Cook's Tour of plastic in your life.
and you remember that I challenged you to try to find out if you could avoid purchasing plastics for a week, and if you are able to do that, I challenged you to avoid using plastics for a week.
and I believe that today is a virtual impossibility.
so I started to do a little inventory in my own life and actually got quite disturbed at myself and my own ignorance and what I had exposed my family to.
and I became extremely interested in trying to kind of reconstruct why I was so clueless about the thousands of different products that had made their way into my life and into my family's life.
contact lenses are a good example.
there are hard contact lenses and there are soft contact lenses.
the hard lenses could contain bisphenol-A, it's a polycarbonate.
the softer contact lenses that will change their shape with your eye or as they rotate across a surface that is not completely even, those contact lenses normally contain phthalates.
phthalates are softeners, so bisphenol-A is the hardener, phthalates are softeners.
and these phthalates are a particular problem with respect to one, which is called diethyl phthalate, DEHP, that I'll talk about a little bit later.
my daughter wears a retainer.
she's ten years old, my youngest daughter.
and I don't know what's in that.
but I would imagine that it's predominately polycarbonate.
she wears it about twelve to fifteen hours per day.
and also, most people have dental sealants.
dental sealants are pretty interesting.
so that you can test people's saliva after the dental sealants are put in and you can find the bisphenol-A in the saliva.
also, there's a protective characteristic of these sealants.
they prevent you from getting cavities that would demand putting a different kind of plastic into your tooth or a metal amalgam.
and many people in my generation and my parents' generation have fillings in their mouths that include metal amalgams, including compounds such as mercury.
so it's a very interesting kind of a tradeoff one might make.
think about different other sources of plastic in your life.
most of you are probably familiar with that smell of the vinyl shower curtain when you first open the package and for a couple of days it's off gassing in your bathroom.
different kinds of clothing, raincoats, fabrics,
gore-tex, for example, are made out of different plastic resins.
and these also are generally non-recyclable.
and I want you to think about the built environment.
when a house is built in the Northeastern part of the U. S., it's generally framed out of wood.
you see the plywood there that's being tacked onto these two by fours or two by sixes.
and then you see the plastic sheathing that is being attached made by DuPont called Tyvek.
Tyvek is an interesting product in that it seals the house from mold.
and that also has a protective effect in that molds are known to threaten human health and induce asthma or exacerbate it, as one example.
but this product also is extremely rarely recycled.
Tyvek also you can find in a variety of different settings.
here's a Tyvek disposable coverall that is claimed by the corporation to protect against more than 150 hazardous chemicals.
so for those people that work with hazardous chemicals, here's a product that helps to protect them
the idea of it being disposable caught my attention.
it's advertised as being disposable.
certainly most things are disposable, but that doesn't give you any clue about where they might end up eventually in the environment.
in this case, this will not break down for probably hundreds if not thousands of years.
now think about a house.
this house has plastic in many different areas.
it's got vinyl siding on it, it has pillars, you can see pillars here on the front and over on the side.
you might think those pillars are formed out of wood or perhaps that they're ceramic, but they're generally plastic.
you see the light post, that's plastic as well.
you see the railing on top of the front porch near the front door here.
this is also probably a polyvinylchloride plastic.
also the doors are commonly plastic.
the windows, the window frames are plastic.
and how do they seal?
when your door shuts, it doesn't shut with hard plastic meeting hard plastic, it's got a separate liner that lies next to the door that will absorb the shock and also it will prevent heat from escaping.
so generally with a window, you'll have several different kinds of plastic, the same with doors.
the vent that you see up here near the peak of the roof also would be plastic.
so that the exterior surfaces of this structure are predominately made out of plastic.
many paints also contain plastics within them.
think also about cord or wire
wire is generally coated with vinyl, polyvinylchloride.
and just as an example, there are, in a new building like Kroon Hall, where I've got my office, there are probably hundreds of miles of electrical conduit that circulate through that single building.
and then think about power lines and the sheathing that exists on the power lines.
well how many miles of power line do you think there are in the United States?
well, one thing you could do is you could just calculate on Google, type in number of miles of roads in the United States, because most roads are also corridors for power lines.
so I would estimate that we probably have hundreds of billions of miles of electrical cable that's sheeted in polyvinylchloride, all of which is not recyclable.
interestingly, the value of copper inside the wire is high enough to encourage its recycling.
but the value of the PVC is negligible.
now I'd also like you to think about your own water supply.
think about where you grew up.
do you know where your water came from?
do you know how it was piped to your faucets?
well, here's an example of a water supply being fed by copper pipes at the top.
and then there's a distribution network throughout the house, going to say the refrigerator or going to the kitchen sink, going to toilets in different parts of the house.
well this also is made out of plastic.
and one would think that somebody would have demanded that these chemicals be tested to understand whether or not they would leach out of the lines.
and in many cases, particularly with newer houses, you'll have a filtration system.
and you may have seen these cartridge filtration systems.
they look like canisters.
they come in various sizes.
I've got one in my house that's a sediment filter as one example.
and it was put in before I understood this whole plastics issue.
and I also can tell you that it's almost impossible to find a water filter that's not made out of plastic.
so within this plastic canister, it's got a top that screws on.
so to change the filtration you take the filter material out and then you put a new one in after a certain number of months.
so that most water filters also are plastic.
also, nobody asked the question, well, what's leaching out of the filters into the water line?
now I'd like you to think about the vehicle environment. It's kind of interesting.
I use the phrase that people are spending in the United States about ninety percent of their time indoors.
well it's about eighty-seven percent of their time indoors and it's about three to four percent of their time within vehicles.
and think about the interior cabins.
on the upper left here, a new vehicle, so that this probably has maybe a couple of dozen different polymers in it, ranging from the TV screen and all of its components down through the plastic steering wheel, plastic dashboard, the plastic console between the seats.
different kinds of plastics in the seat itself, including the polyurethane foam inside the seat, almost none of which are recyclable.
so eventually most of these parts that are made out of plastic are simply going to be burned, which gives off quite a bit of energy in an incinerator because of a high carbon content in the plastic.
so remember that most of these plastics are derived from what?
they're petroleum-based.
so that it's very important to recall that fossil fuels, oil is the predominant source of plastics.
the interior of a subway or in this case, and Amtrak train on the upper right, also is predominantly plastic, as is the interior of an airline cabin.
and this is all for an interesting and really important purpose.
and that is to lighten the weight of the vehicle.
so thirty years ago, vehicles were much heavier than they are today.
so an average vehicle today might be 2, 500 pounds, but an average vehicle perhaps forty years ago was perhaps 300 or 400 pounds more than that.
indeed, there are about 300 pounds of plastic in every new vehicle.
and it's pretty much guaranteed that that material would not be recycled.
also, I'd like you to think about coatings, the whole idea of coating things.
I realized that fairly late in my career that I hadn't paid any attention to coatings.
but if you think about the number of buildings that exist in the world, the number of buildings in the United States, think like say Sherwin Williams, the paint industry. You know what their phrase is?
you know what their corporate motto is?
their corporate motto is "Cover the Earth.
and you see this red paint, their symbol is red paint that is flowing down across the top of a globe.
well, think about the surface area simply of this room.
think about the surface area in your house.
the flooring, think about the walls, think about the ceiling.
and if you're an executive for a paint company, you're thinking "Oh my gosh, we have such a huge market.
everybody is going to want to paint something a different color, and should we make the paints to be more stable or not quite as stable so that they would want to repaint after a certain number of years?
so just as another example, I've done this myself,
I've refinished floors, which is a pretty nasty business.
you don't want to spend much of your life refinishing a floor, especially if you are dressed such as this gentleman is, with no respirator on.
because he's breathing in a pretty nasty mixture of dusts that include of course the wood flooring, but it also includes the plastic, the polyurethanes that are put down on the floor.
you can see them right here up on the podium.
you can see the shiny coating on top of the desk, and you can see it also on the desks on the side of your chairs.
so that the number of surface coatings in the world is enormous in area, and we don't really think about the long-term consequences of that.
what would happen if we didn't coat these surfaces?
what would happen to the floor?
I mean, could you wash it?
could you not put a coating like polyurethane or varnish on walls like this?
would they decay or break down more quickly?
and the answer is, no.
and I've been wondering about that and I've been wondering about the origin or aesthetic of smoothness.
we love smooth things, whether or not it's skin, whether or not it's a surface.
if something is rough and harsh then it has a negative attitude toward it.
so if you're in the business of making these coatings, you play on that.
also, if you're in the business of selling cosmetics, you also play on that.
what about other sources?
I've mentioned fragrances in the past.
these two contain plasticizers, diethyl phthalate has been found in a number of common perfumes as well as in some air fresheners.
and also, think about other kinds of products in your life.
now why is a diaper absorbent?
why is a personal hygiene product absorbent?
well this diaper has probably two or three different kinds of plastic within it.
and what's going to happen to this?
well certainly, it's not going to be recycled.
it's likely to be burned or buried.
think about where you sleep.
what is your mattress made out of?
anybody here know exactly what your mattress is made out of?
well, it's a very difficult thing to discover.
again, there's no requirement to label the content of your mattress or your pillow.
you get a broad description of it, like polyester filled, polyurethane foam, but you really don't know what the environmental fate of these compounds might be.
so what I'm doing is I'm painting a picture for you here that we're all as innocent, you're all as innocent as I am in thinking that, well, somebody must have been paying attention to this.
nobody would really want us to be lying with our noses within a half an inch of a surface where we had no understanding of what the chemical content is.
think about toys.
ninety percent of the toys produced in the world now, between eighty percent and ninety percent are produced in China.
and increasingly, they are made out of plastic.
you know, consider yourself to be the executive of McDonald's and you're thinking about the introduction of a new meal, a new supersized meal or maybe an environmentally responsible downsized meal.
what are you going to do?
well, one of the first things you're going to do is you're going to try to contract out with a toy manufacturer to try to figure out what the next toy is going to be that you're going to give for free so all the children, when they come to McDonald's, will sit and play with the toy while they eat their hamburger.
well, what happens to those toys?
the overwhelming majority of them get discarded within a week of when they're issued.
and these also are not recycled.
think about your own entertainment, what you purchase.
and by the way, all of these toys are wrapped in plastic of different forms.
and think about the polycarbonate CD disc, the number of CD discs that you have lying around your house or your apartment or your dorm room.
and think about how you bought it?
well, it came in a cover that looked something like this.
and it probably was also wrapped in some other additional kind of a vinyl coating, plastic coating on the outside that makes it actually difficult to get the disc out, at least in the store in an unobtrusive manner.
so think about your iPhones, think about your iPods, think about your computers, think about your electronic world.
I want to talk a little bit more about food.
because food, as it turns out, is now believed to be the predominant source of chemical components in plastic that are now measurable in human tissues.
and I'd like you to think also about the way that we store food, the way that we buy food, the way that it's processed and how it's packaged and sold.
and it's done in very specific ways to promote its freshness and to avoid food-borne illnesses, and this is very important.
but we haven't been thinking ecologically about how to manage this problem, because really no one has designed these products so that the end of the life fate is being considered.
indeed, no producer really has responsibility for disposal or the ultimate fate of the product.
think also about your electronic world with respect to computers.
I became fascinated when I read that a printer I was using had ink in it.
and the ink, I mean obviously, the printer is formed predominately out of plastic or different kinds of plastics, including the electronics board.
but I didn't know that the ink itself could have plastic in it.
why would ink have plastic in it?
well, it turns out that the plastic in bisphenol-A has an effect on paper that it prevents the ink from spreading into the fibers of the paper once it's applied.
this is apparently more common with the inkjet printers or the heat-driven printers that you get as a credit card receipt.
think also about bisphenol-A and polycarbonates and the next generation of water bottles and containers.
so that many people have recognized now that when infants are fed formula, it's very common for a mom or a dad or whoever to fill up a bottle, a plastic bottle, either with hot water or to put it in the microwave.
so that the idea that heating of these products could energize the molecules and cause some of them to migrate into the food or the liquid itself, this was not tested.
it was not required to be tested in a sufficient way by the Food and Drug Administration.
although the Food and Drug Administration has the legal authority to do so.
so what I'm doing is painting a picture here that the Environmental Protection Agency has the responsibility to implement the Toxic Substance Control Act.
they have not required prior testing.
they have not demanded that hazardous components, those chemicals that are found to adversely affect the health of other species, that they be eliminated from the product.
and there's no labeling involved, either in the country of origin or in the chemical composition of the product.
so there's absolutely no way that the consumer has to discriminate between a safe or unsafe or environmentally responsible products.
also, I want you to think a little bit more about what we drink from.
and many of these containers have some fibers, plant material in them.
but they are often coated with plastic as well.
this is a typical grocery store.
and the next time you walk into a supermarket,
I hope you walk down the aisles.
and I want you to pay special attention and look particularly for products that are not wrapped in plastic or they're not stored in plastic environments.
the same thing goes with respect to Coke.
I gave a lecture similar to this several months ago.
and I was struck.
a gentleman came up after the lecture, he was a very heavyset guy.
and he said, "I drink three to four liters of soda every day.
and he said, "From what you said,
I'm worried about the plastic chemicals migrating into the liquids and whether or not it's building up in my body.
I'm thinking, oh, three to four liters of soda per day.
that's not good with respect to the sugar alone.
and he said, "Well, from what you've said, the internal lining of the cans is lined with an epoxy resin that often contains bisphenol-A.
now, should I choose to drink Coke in cans or should I drink the Coke out of these liter bottles that are made out of polyethylene.
well I said to him, I thought for a couple of minutes and I said, "Well, you know, I think I would avoid the cans because at least the polyethylene does not have a hormonally active compound in it such as bisphenol-A.
well he was not pleased about the story.
but it gives you some insight into the way that the epoxy resins are being used in order to prevent oxidization on the inside of all sorts of cans.
canned tomatoes, think about your dining hall, any of you work in the dining hall, think about the large cans that they have their food delivered within.
and all these are potential sources of exposure.
think of the way that meats are packaged, that are wrapped in vinyl that are sitting on polystyrene, none of which is recycled.
what happens when you get your food home?
well, you bring it into a refrigerator.
and where do you store it?
you store it inside plastic bins.
and my refrigerator looks quite a bit like this.
and what I am not showing you here is the water supply.
so that some refrigerators have a little interior cut out in the front door where you push a glass into it to get fresh water or it's an ice dispenser.
so that tracing the origin of the water to that will lead you to plastic tubing, which is made out of a phthalate, could be bisphenol-A.
what happens to all these products once we get rid of them?
well, it's kind of ironic that we take them out and we put them in a plastic trash bin.
I just walked in past Vanderbilt Hall and you all know the walkway.
and there are about fifteen or twenty different plastic garbage cans all lined up.
what happens to those when they crack?
where do they end up?
similarly, most will end up either underground or they will end up in incinerators.
think about sports.
I was thinking about Lindsey Vonn.
and as I was skiing over Christmas break,
I thought about my own gear that I have on.
I had plastic skis on, I had plastic boots on,
I had a plastic polycarbonate helmet on,
I had plastic goggles on, on top of my polycarbonate plastic lenses.
I had a Gortex jacket on, I had waterproof pants on that not only were synthetic and formed at least in part out of plastic, but they also had been applied with a waterproofing agent that we talked about earlier, a compound that basically is designed to prevent molecules from resting on them.
so that they shed water, they shed stains, stain-resistant chemicals.
and also, I had underwear that was long underwear that was made out of fleece.
fleece is polyethylene often.
and fleece actually can be recycled, so that some people claim, such as Patagonia, that they use a certain percentage of recycled polyethylene when they make some of their products.
the poles themselves are made often out of plastic, as are the handles and the baskets.
so that just about any sport you can imagine is now dependent quite heavily on plastic.
the sleds that they use, the sled that won the Games the other night for the U. S.
has an outer shell that would be polycarbonate, so it would have reduced weight but great strength.
by the way, I really appreciated plastic in my car about two years ago.
I was driving down ninety-five and I was rear ended by a maniac who was going about ninety-five miles an hour, the police estimated.
and I was doing about seventy or seventy-five.
but my car survived quite well.
it's a Toyota.
and the Toyota absorbed the shock in the back and I fishtailed back and forth in the passing lane and eventually brought my car over.
I got out and looked at the back and the back end was all banged up and smashed up.
and that's when I realized, boy, they really have a system down here with these collapsible bumpers where they have different kinds of plastic that are lined up that have different degrees of hardness in them to basically distribute the energy from a crash.
so the use of plastic compounds for their lightness, for their energy conservation, for their safety, it is clearly growing in public acceptance.
think also about other recreational equipment.
many of you may have a Camelbak.
what's in a Camelbak anyway?
well, it's a plastic bladder made from polyurethane, but it contains no bisphenol-A or no phthalates.
there is an antimicrobial silver lining.
so when people started realizing that they didn't want to buy the sport bottles, such as Nalgene because of bisphenol-A,
Camelbak was quite fortunate that they had chosen a different material.
and think about stainless steel bottles, such as these Klean Kanteens.
these are not lined with an epoxy resin that contains bisphenol-A.
and I told you the story about my own well water.
but this is a good example here of a tank that also has a-- this is my water supply.
a tank that has an epoxy resin coating on the inside, and then over here on the right-hand side, you can see that canister, that water filter that I was describing to you earlier.
think about the Brita filter system.
brita also is made out of a plastic polycarbonate and also a styrene.
and if you pay attention to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, you know that bottled water curiously is under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration, whereas EPA is responsible for tap water.
that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
there's a separate set of compounds that one might expect in bottled water, based upon the potential for the compounds to leach from the plastic into the water.
so overall, the plastic problem is that it surrounds us, we live in it, we eat from it, we drink it, we play with it, we work with it, we listen to it, we watch it, we cook in it.
so where is this material going in the environment?
for one of the phthalates, the DEHP I mentioned earlier, here's an example of mean concentrations detectable now in the environmental.
it's detectable in surface water.
it's detected in ground water.
it's detected in drinking water.
it's in sediments in the bottoms of lakes as well as streams and rivers.
it's found commonly in soils.
it's found especially in soils that are beneath landfills.
so when we buried the plastic material, nobody thought about how bad the soil contamination might get, how concentrated, and where it might migrate and could it get down into the underlying aquifer.
it's found in indoor air, 109 nanograms per cubic meter.
it's found in outdoor air, which to me is really quite surprising.
again, this is a function of the sensitivity of the detection technology.
but this is really quite a comment on our neglect of chemicals and misunderstanding their movement through the environment and their ultimate fate.
it's detectable inside in house dust.
it's detectable in waste water.
that should be no surprise.
and why would that be?
well, my gosh, I mean, we're feeding ourselves with water that's coming in pipes that are made out of plastics, and then we're disposing of waste, the drainpipes themselves are polyvinylchloride.
so why wouldn't you find residues in the waste water?
and for me in one way this is maybe the most disturbing, it's in the rainwater, so that it's detectable in rainwater just the same way that strontium-90 was detectable in rainwater.
so here's a case where we've got an industry that basically has a legal framework that most of the other chemical companies, like tobacco, pesticides, pharmaceutical companies,
I mean, they would kill to have a legal license such as is being enjoyed by the plastics industry.
this is an example of serious failure, and it would be a really interesting kind of a longer-term research project if anybody's looking for a senior essay down the road to ask the question, especially if you're interested in political science, why wouldn't this industry be more heavily regulated than it is?
how did they escape control?
how do they fly underneath the radar screen?
again, I'm reminded of Dustin Hoffman's film, The Graduate, where a middle-aged guy walks up to Dustin Hoffman and pulls him aside at a party where Mrs. Robinson is hovering around in the background next to the pool.
and he walks up and he says, "I have one word for you, son.
and it's plastics.
now this was back in the mid-1960s.
so that we've had this explosion of an industry that's gotten into hundreds of thousands of different products.
the chemicals, plastic chemicals have gotten into the products, they've made their way into our life.
and most of us have recognized what's plastic and generally what's not.
but we really haven't thought about what it might mean for either our health or environmental quality.
so I want to spend just a couple of minutes having you think about the hormonal question that's being raised by plastics.
and this was first recognized by Rachel Carson when she wrote Silent Spring back in 1962.
and I've mentioned this on occasions before, but not with respect to hormonally active compounds, where she discovered along with colleagues that exposure to a variety of pesticides that where hormonally active prevented calcium metabolism in eggshells.
so that it caused reproductive failure in certain species, especially large raptors.
well that concept--that we need to worry about reproductive effects of some of these chemicals
it really escaped much attention on the part of government through the majority of the '60s and 1970s and then 1980s.
and then in 1996, Theo Colburn, who also is a wildlife ecologist like Rachel Carson, wrote Our Stolen Future. So if you're interested in this history,
I would encourage you to read Our Stolen Future. It's written as kind of a mystery story, a scientific detective story they say in their subtitle.
but she wrote this with Diane Dumanowski, a longtime reporter with the Boston Globe, and John Meyers, who also is a wildlife ecologist.
if you want to follow this in more detail,
I recommend Ted Shettler's and Gina Solomon's book called Generations at Risk.
so thinking about how our fertility might be affected by these chemicals, that we're experiencing mixtures without our knowledge, without our consent.
this is really the subject of most of these books.
so I want to look more carefully at one of these compounds, bisphenol-A, because it's one that I think almost everybody now has detectable levels of BPA in their tissues.
and it's now recognized to leach from containers.
it's in soils and surface water and fish.
and it's highest in kids aged one to six.
now that's really pretty curious.
why would it be highest in kids ages one to six?
experts inside EPA and FDA now believe that food and beverages are the dominant sources of exposure.
by the way, there is yet no good answer to the question why the kids are more heavily exposed.
the effects in animals include female reproductive tract abnormalities, including abnormalities in the ovary and abnormalities of the reproductive tract in older female mice and changed vaginal morphology among post-pubertal offspring.
and it also influences the male reproductive system in different species, including reduced sperm production, reduced mice testis weight and enhanced anogenital distance.
it also has been shown to induce mammary gland development in mice.
so thinking about this chemical and thinking about the different decision making standards that exist in different environmental laws that we've got,
I'm curious about this in that in bisphenol-A were being sold as a biocide, as a pesticide, the EPA could not possibly license this chemical for use.
the persistence of the chemical, its environmental fate, its threat to health as evidenced by these studies would be significant enough to prevent that from happening.
it's also been associated more recently with insulin resistance, raising questions about diabetes.
and also, there is some evidence of impaired immune function.
now think about the fact that we're all being exposed to hormonally active chemicals and mixtures without really understanding it.
we don't really know what the intensity of our exposure is.
so what are we seeing out there in terms of fertility or diseases of reproduction in humans?
well, we're seeing a rise in the prevalence of infertility, a serious rise over the past several decades.
and we're also seeing a rise in some negative effects in humans, in males, particularly in young males, increase in hypospadias, which means that the opening of the penis does not occur at the end of the penis, it occurs further up the shaft.
and also cryptorchidism, which means that little kids don't have fully descended testicles when they're born.
so that there are a variety of different reproductive problems occurring in the population at higher incidence than formerly.
well, it's curious when a debate like this occurs, when a product is out there on the marketplace, it's traded globally, what do we do about it?
well, the government, the regulatory agencies tend to call in experts and get expert opinions.
so the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, convened a panel, it turned out the panel was put together and some of the reading materials were put together by some representatives of the industry itself so that many had a view that this was not really an independent analysis of what the effects of bisphenol-A might be.
and they concluded with a phrase "That there is some concern that exposure to bisphenol-A causes some of these reproductive problems.
a second panel was convened of independent scientists that had no connections to the plastics industry or the industry at all.
and they concluded something quite different.
the wide range of adverse effects of low doses of BPA in laboratory animals exposed both during development and adulthood is a source for concern with regard to the potential for similar adverse effects in humans.
so that this idea that you take a question of science and you raise it in front of a group of experts really forces one to think carefully about what the conflicts of interest might be for those experts.
how could you put together a committee that clearly was independent?
well, full disclosure is one way of doing that.
so that demanding the people disclose their income tax records or disclose their affiliations or their consulting relationships with different industries could clarify in the public's mind whether or not there is a high probability of a bias.
well, remember what I said about bisphenol-A being the hardener, the phthalate, DEHP is a softener, it's produced in a much lower volume, 260 million pounds per year.
it's also found in our bodies.
it's added to PVC plastic.
and its recycling percentage is close to zero.
and it also is widely found in the environment.
and it's been found with similar kinds of adverse effects in males, in test animals, including reduced sperm production and early onset of puberty.
and all of this exposure is coming predominately because of the failure of the Toxic Substance Control Act.
so Congress really recognized that we needed to test these chemicals before they made their way into the market back in the early 1970s.
so they passed TSCA and gave the authority to EPA to demand pre-market testing.
but they didn't do anything about it.
so again, the universe of chemicals is big, 82, 000 chemicals traded in commerce, they have some commercial value.
about 20, 000 of those were added since 1986.
and what that means is that this statute, the way it's worded, it granted exemptions as chemicals that were grandfathered or protected in the marketplace that couldn't be removed by EPA to 62, 000 different compounds.
the statute is unusual also because it places a high burden on EPA to demonstrate that there is a significant danger before it can demand from the industry that they produce the evidence.
now, just pharmaceuticals and like pesticides and other products that we've talked about, how much sense does it make to have the industry producing the data themselves and then presenting their case to the Environmental Protection Agency for licensing?
where should this occur?
should there be some sort of an independent organization set up that would be more protected from potential bias?
well clearly, there's an economic stake involved, and industry is anxious to spend that money.
but this high burden on EPA to demonstrate danger is the primary reason for the failure of the Toxic Substance Control Act.
so that over this period of time, they have demanded testing for only 200 different chemicals.
and out of those 200, only five have been prohibited.
so what are states and other governmental agencies doing about this?
well, a variety of state initiatives, including here in Connecticut, have been launched.
and a number of us have been involved in drafting legislation in different states.
but here in Connecticut, we now have a statute on the books as of last year that requires that bisphenol-A be taken out of products that are intended to be used by young children.
and similar statutes have been passed in these other states.
you can think about regulatory policy being of testing a chemical, figuring how dangerous it is and then figuring out how you might regulate it.
or you might just say, here's a clear threshold.
if a chemical behaves in this way, say it's persistent, it's bioaccumulative, it's found in human tissues, and it's demonstrated to be hormonally active, that that's it.
it's out of the marketplace.
that's a prohibitive policy.
so once you decide not to employ a prohibitive policy, once you decide not to ban, you basically require the regulatory agency to figure out exactly which uses would be allowed and which would not.
and it creates a very expensive and difficult, time consuming monitoring and enforcement problem for an agency.
so the regulation--chemical by chemical, use by use
is not likely to have much effect in solving a problem such as this.
california is requiring a listing of DEHP under its Proposition 65.
and this was required in 2008.
and what it's done is, it's limited the concentration of DEHP in products to less than 0. 01 percent.
now what would that do?
you're going to limit the concentration of a chemical in a product to 0. 012 percent.
it's going to force the government into becoming a monitoring organization.
so it's got to go out and it's got to test in order to find products that do not comply.
again, very expensive, and a strategy that's not likely to work.
now, the European Union is taking a very different approach.
they have adopted a law in 2006 known as REACH.
and REACH requires toxicity and environmental fate testing for 1, 500 of the highest volume chemicals, the highest amount produced among the 80, 000 chemicals that are out there that are poorly tested.
it's also a program that's been delayed.
the endocrine screening program will not begin until 2012.
the mixture problem remains.
they still are not going to tackle the issue that we're exposed in mixtures that might act via the same mechanism.
and also, they will be grandfathering many of the chemicals that are produced in the smaller quantities.
but why would it not make sense to focus exclusively on the high-production volume chemicals?
well, you've got to think about the fact that there could be some chemicals that are extremely potent and extremely dangerous at very low doses.
so plutonium again is a good example of that.
also, corporations are acting on their own, so that PVC corporate phase-out policies have been adopted by a variety of firms, including these.
and this is having a very significant effect.
number one, it's educating a lot of people.
when they see a label that says PVC free or BPA free, they start to pay attention and ask questions, why that might be.
and I want you to back up and I want you to think about really what the core of this problem is.
it really is consumerism, the fact that we buy much more than we need.
we don't pay attention in a way to the ingredients of different products that we bring into our environment.
it also has to do with the ignorance of our effects of our own behavior.
when I was preparing this lecture over the past couple of days, I have to admit that I got really angry with myself.
I got angry and I got surprised, because I think of myself as somebody that should have known better.
I should have adjusted my lifestyle to what I recognize as a potential threat, not just to the environment, not just to the population, but to my own kids.
so there are many reasons for that that don't have to do with me.
but I should have known better than that.
and hopefully after taking this course, you will not make this kind of problem yourself.
you can think about national regulation as a partial solution because the markets are global.
people are trading these products and chemicals across national borders all the time.
so what does it mean if the United States passes a law, but say Germany does not pass the law?
or Germany's got a more restrictive statute than the United States?
that's a recipe for trade barriers that are likely to be eventually litigated.
so think also about the concentration and dispersion of products and the effect of one corporation like McDonald's or say Toyota to make a choice that they are going to not use certain products.
that they're not going to distribute a billion new toys over the next two years with their new market line.
or that they're going to demand ultimate accountability for the eventual fate or end of life of their product, the way that some of the printer companies have that have demanded the recycling, or not demanded, but offered to take back the ink cartridges once they are empty.
so basically, the government has been neglecting externalities and there has been an absence of accountability.
so here is a list of potential solutions.
and I know we're out of time.
go through these.
these will be up on the website later this afternoon.
so I'm going to conclude there and just remind you that the electronic exam will be emailed out to you today at five o'clock, that you have forty-eight hours to return it, and return it both to the Classesv2 server drop box, but also please return it to your teaching assistants.
thanks very much, and good luck.
and I probably won't see many of you before break,
==TLF HALFCD ==
martin bedell.
his name was Martin bedell.
he was in century work camp with you.
right up until the escape.
so I knew him.
you knew him.
everybody knew him.
but he doesn't know this one, does he?
not this Martin bedell.
no, another Martin bedell.
maybe it's just coincidence.
how many coincidences named Sarah Connor got killed,
before skynet finally locked in on you?
so why would they want to kill him?
he had experience and knowledge John needed.
military prep school, then west point.
bedell had real training.
he helped John put the resistance together.
okay,
there were three Martin bedells in l. a.
now there are two.
so how do we know which one is the target?
they both are.
machines are thorough.
only good thing about them.
so it took you, what, 30 seconds to find those names?
if there is a triple-eight out there,
he's found them too.
where are you going?
martin bedell number one.
closest address.
without a plan?
Yeah, I've got a plan.
it involves guns.
wait.
you're not going with him.
no. everybody wait.
P. alto.
we thought it was a person. it's not, it's a place.
it's a military prep school in carlsbad.
here's the student directory.
martin bedell number two.
maybe we got a head start.
I'll load the truck.
we'll go.
we will, will we?
it's a boys school.
I can do this.
I am doing this.
nothing complicated.
find the kid,
throw him in a hole, babysit.
it's as safe as anything we do.
go.
two.
two Sarah Connors were murdered
before they found me.
cameron and I will find the other Martin bedell.
maybe we can stop the triple-eight
before he gets to you.
he's not a soldier.
no.
not yet.
you haven't said a word since anaheim.
that's 40 miles of quiet.
U, u, u thinking or worrying?
thinking.
about Bedell.
after we grab him, where are we supposed to hide him?
who said we were going to hide him?
martin bedell hiding in a cave somewhere
might as well be Martin bedell dead somewhere.
no use to John Connor.
besides, it's a military school.
soldiers, guns,
can't do much better than that.
so you own this nuclear plant, serrano point?
I have an interest in it.
is this the same company you were referring to the other day?
the one you wanted me to look into?
it is.
the near-meltdown a few weeks back...
the news said an employee caused the accident.
Mr. ellison,
there are no accidents.
[Presidio Alto Military Academy]
Kansas, this is hammerhead. do you copy?
Kansas, respond! it's kyle. he's back.
tin cans just hit kansas bunker.
survivors?
prisoners now.
one ogre tank, three monkey wagons.
the convoy will roll out
down wilshire to century in the next hour.
and I'm thinking
no, uh-uh. we've got our orders.
Connor wants this corridor controlled.
so we sit tight,
we observe skynet movement,
and we'll report back
at regular intervals, and that's it.
what's that report going to say?
that we observed skynet move these people into a death camp
while we sat?
I know! I know it sucks, all right?
but if we lose eyes on this road,
we could lose a lot more than one bunker, kyle.
if Connor were here
Connor isn't here.
corporal, get below.
round up every tunnel rat you can find.
Martin.
you know what he'd say.
you know what Connor would say.
Yes, I know what he'd say.
if Connor wants to shoot me for disobeying orders,
he can get in line behind the tin cans.
we're doing this.
you all right?
we see a lot of boys like your nephew, lieutenant.
single mother. socially withdrawn.
move around a lot.
tend to cling to male authority figures.
lost his dad, you said, in the war?
killed.
on a mission.
can't tell you any more than that.
don't know?
can't.
I understand.
well...
good grades. good test scores.
good kid.
here's what I'll do.
three weeks as a plebe.
if he likes it, he can stay.
then we'll talk tuition.
thank you.
I'll give him the news.
lieutenant.
I lost one of my tacs a couple weeks ago.
reservist. had to go.
tac. teacher-advisor.
they keep the cadets
from going all lord of the flies on us.
hired a replacement, but he's not due for a week.
I'm shorthanded.
sir... respectfully,
I'm probably the last guy you're looking for.
guys like you get dropped into the ass end of nowhere.
you can handle 30 adolescents for a week.
good news. you're in.
and what's the bad news?
I'm in.
man up, nube!
you don't want to get owned.
stop crying about your internet connection,
and learn to play.
I got to e. f.k. man.
martin bedell?
yes?
come on, let's go.
hurry up! Go!
go! go!
drive.
you good? you okay?
seatbelt.
who is that man? he should be dead.
how come he's not dead
and where's my mom?
no more questions.
your mother's current location is unknown.
that man is a cyborg
sent to kill you.
Cameron!
get your seatbelt on.
I don't care about the reports, mr. nelson.
I know what they say.
what I don't know is what really happened.
people who wrote that report are bureaucrats.
you know what bureaucrats do when the facts
don't fit their little checkboxes?
ignore them.
or change them.
so this valve supposedly blew open
sure. okay.
not likely, but let's grant mother nature that one.
so how in the hell did it force itself closed?
okay.
how strong do you have to be,
to force it open and push it back?
on a scale of one to ten?
Superman.
report says this damage
was caused by a transformer explosion.
you want to see what the security tapes say?
there are no tapes.
they're gone. that they are.
and who took those?
Carl greenway, on the way to hanging himself?
those mystery employees who shut the reactor down?
you ask the same questions I would.
putting together a report for the nrc.
they're going to crawl up this place's ass
with a wire brush.
it's going to play hell with the schedule.
schedule?
what schedule is that?
august 2009.
new automated system comes online.
we're back in business.
that's what they say.
of course, that ain't going to happen
if the feds are on a war path.
you jammed? yeah.
you know sports?
like wrestling?
no, it's a mnemonic.
sports. s-p-o-r-t-s. may i?
all right. so you want to slap.
pull.
observe.
release.
tap.
shoot.
all right. thanks, plebe.
you're welcome, I think.
Baum.
I'm cadet captain Martin bedell.
commandant asked me to keep an eye on you.
prep you for o. c.c.
what's this?
it's a merit... for squaring away Pyle.
and that's a demerit.
next time you have a problem,
flag down a senior cadet or an instructor.
you run, Baum?
I love to run.
you look ate up.
Oh, no. this is great.
Yeah. imagine how it's going
to be with a marine d. i. screaming at you.
like everything's life and death.
I can imagine.
that the new tac?
good ambush point.
in case you're looking for one.
or in case you choose to jog in the woods.
you should be careful.
of that, too.
it's tar. la brea.
it's everywhere.
that stuff smells terrible.
it smells like
jet fuel.
so...
you're out here jogging, in the open,
exposed, with...
bedell.
I've heard a lot about you.
a lot of good, I hope, sir.
lot of good.
so when do I get to call my mom?
when it's safe.
when's that?
soon.
do you do this every night?
Yeah.
well, what happens when you go to sleep?
she happens.
let's find you something to wear for bed.
something in here should fit you.
try these.
this is too small.
how do you know? just try them.
they're for a five year old.
how 'bout this?
uh, that's for playing soccer.
uh, this isn't your stuff. is it?
no. it's not our stuff.
I want to call my mom.
she was supposed to get me a book.
for my book report.
if you call your mother,
that man will use her to find you.
then he'll kill her.
he'll kill you.
uh, cameron.
would you like a bedtime story?
we made a tactical error.
we should have engaged the triple-eight.
with a little boy in the crossfire?
the boy is not important. he is not our mission
he is now.
it's just a meet and greet, sir.
say hi.
ask them how they're holding up.
then company dismissed.
it's easy.
Oh, they're probably going to want
we take the juniors through field exercises.
obstacle courses, simulated missions.
running around in the woods, you know?
it'll be fun.
fun.
Hi, I'm lieutenant Baum.
I'm your new tac.
so I've been told
that my job is to make sure that you're all doing okay.
well, you all look okay to me.
so, um...
any questions?
all right, then.
sir.
we heard you were in the war.
heard you seen action.
Yeah.
Yeah, I've seen action in the war.
got a lot of kills?
say again?
kills, sir.
I want to go infantry as soon as I get out of here.
maybe rangers. maybe delta.
best of the best.
best of the best.
counting kills.
like it's a game.
like it's just a game.
I remember one particularly fun day.
a guy in my squad
got his stomach blasted open in a fire fight.
he spent six hours holding his own guts in.
his buddy carried him on his back
to the nearest aide station, just praying that someone
could put the dumb son of a bitch together again.
the game, Pyle,
the game is played with your buddy's life.
with the life of your squad.
your platoon.
the game is played by you.
on behalf of the whole damn human race.
meet my friend, the e. f.p.
he sits in the middle of the road
and blows up metal.
this is his life's ambition.
I intend to help him achieve it.
we've seeded the street with these things.
we got to make sure that ogre cooperates.
corporal reese will take you
and set up over at lacma and the page.
when the convoy rolls to your position, open fire
on this bunker.
the ogre will think it's metal on skin
and move to assist.
and when it does, boom.
questions?
move out.
they're kids. they key off of you.
I know.
your uncle...
he's an intense guy.
Yeah, I know.
he's a good guy, though.
he's just-- he's a lot to take sometimes.
all that he's been through.
you know...
what are you supposed to say to that?
you mean, how do you measure up?
every man in my family, going back five generations,
has been a general or statesman,
ceo, something amazing,
they all went here.
but you know what the best part
about presidio alto is?
the cross-country course.
you know, sometimes when I'm out there
when I'm all alone,
and I'm going flat-out
everything just, sort of,
falls away.
but sometimes, I wish that...
wish you could just keep on running
and never look back.
I met this girl
her name is Hlicia.
she's amazing, dude.
she started at dartmouth this year.
she's a runner like me.
she's coming home in a couple of weeks.
when she goes back,
I think I want to go with her...
and never look back.
that's a secret, Baum.
you treat it as such.
I always do.
I was just on the roof.
there's flat terrain all around,
but, uh, the woods are a problem.
when the triple-eight comes,
that's where it'll come from.
you're alone and exposed here.
it's not good.
and you're going to tell me I know better.
bedell is quitting.
leaving school.
no, he isn't.
he won't.
well, he is.
he doesn't.
he graduates.
goes to west point.
Why?
because the future already happened
and he's just going through the motions?
he doesn't have a choice?
he's got a choice.
we've just got to help him make the right one.
like everybody does with me.
there are three exits within 20 meters,
two of them lead to a parking lot,
d d the's a black hatchback
three cars in with the doors unlocked
and the keys above the visor.
I do know better.
we're begging you.
be merciful and keep our son safe.
Marty, if you can hear this,
we're going to get you back.
you're dad and I love-- turn that off.
what the hell were you thinking, letting him watch that?
he wanted to see his mother.
you all right?
I told you people.
and I told you I had to get it done by monday.
and it's friday already.
and I haven't even started,
and I'm already in trouble,
and when you don't do It,
the teacher makes you stand up in front of the whole class!
Marty, slow down.
you're hyperventilating.
there.
take a breath.
tell me what this is about.
I told you.
my book report.
book report?
Yeah. it's due by monday.
and I haven't even picked out a book, yet.
don't you listen?
let's find you one.
there's got to be something for you somewhere.
it was John 's favorite.
who's John ?
the machine won't stop.
he'll go back to that kid's house,
find his parents, find his mom.
I would.
the police'll be there by now.
police won't matter.
I know.
you don't need to be here.
there are other places to be.
you want me to protect his parents?
I want you to keep this contained.
something you need, officer?
good eye.
job requirement.
right.
private sector.
looking into the plant accident.
when Carl greenway went nuts?
Yeah. when Carl greenway went nuts.
I understand he used to come in here.
they all do. including carl.
sit right where you're sitting.
drink alone.
drink a lot?
tonic water.
like you, I bet.
was he alone like me?
pretty much every night.
I don't know why the guy came in here at all.
still, I do remember some hottie
chatting him up at the bar the night before
everything went down at the power plant.
probably one of sandy's friends.
Sandra runs h. r. at the plant.
her birthday party that night,
I got pictures.
may I?
find who you're looking for?
actually, quite the opposite.
these going to kill it?
no, a speed bump. that's all.
now, this...
Raufoss.
mark 211 round.
tungsten core, armor piercing.
high explosive incendiary.
hits with the force of a 20 millimeter cannon.
saw your dad take down an h-k with one of those.
he liked it better than his plasma rifle.
so this is going to kill it.
it'll make it stop.
reconsider its life choices.
that soldier...
the one you talked about in your story.
my dad carried him to that aid station,
didn't he?
Yeah.
he spent a whole night in the bunker,
trying to get the blood out of his fatigues.
you know what's funny?
I saw a deer the other day.
it made me think of him.
we were together the last time I saw one.
before judgment day?
no. after.
we were up in griffith park, hunting for food.
it was a big bastard too.
your dad had never seen one before.
I mean, not like that.
after I killed it and we got close...
your dad started crying.
you know, more than I'd ever heard
or seen him.
I didn't know how to make him stop.
I buried the deer.
we went hungry.
he was just a boy.
so were you.
Yep.
I guess I was.
you see how the metal is twisted?
you can have the steelers' entire offensive line
Tuggin' on that valve
and not generate enough force to do that.
so you agree it was a machine,
as I thought.
two machines.
one machine ripped the valve open,
and I'm guessing
the other closed it.
and I'm pretty sure there was a fight between them.
two machines.
this is new.
where did they come from?
why did they fight?
um, I wish I knew.
I wish any of this made sense.
I do know I'm not the only one asking questions.
the plant manager, nelson.
he wants the nrc to investigate.
it'll be a nightmare.
that will complicate our respective goals,
won't it, James?
what would those respective goals be?
I'd like my company
to lead the world into the next century.
and I'm fairly sure
you're an avenging angel.
so let's keep looking.
before the nightmare begins.
last one.
Hey, it's for my heart.
you never heard of the french paradox?
those frogs eat foie gras
and gargle red wine
they live till they're 90.
Yeah, but it's the chemicals
in the grape skins that do It.
well, uh...
Bonjour.
Resvera...something.
I saw it on 60 minutes.
you don't say.
you're so beautiful.
sorry, Hlicia.
that's never happened before.
don't worry, sweetie.
I bet that never happened before, either.
the fbi has moved Marty's parents.
and the triple-eight?
he's made no attempt to acquire them.
so what would you do now?
in your professional robot opinion.
Marty's trail has gone cold.
I'd switch targets to the other Martin bedell.
so go to the other Martin bedell's house.
wait for the triple-eight.
when it shows up, blow it's head off.
he can put it back on.
Marty likes the crust cut off.
here you go.
my teacher doesn't like us to pick books
that have been made into movies.
she thinks we'll just cheat and watch the movie instead.
you'd be in big trouble if you did.
the movie is pretty different than the book.
Really?
how?
well, the slippers aren't ruby.
they're silver.
and there are two good witches, not one.
and dorothy's not 16,
she's nearer your age.
smart and brave.
if that guy finds me,
he's really going to kill me.
he won't touch you.
I promise.
Baum.
how you holding up?
shouldn't you be digging a tunnel outta here or something?
I'm not just going to skip out on my buddies.
I owe them this much.
not everybody gets to run away, you know.
pick up the pace, Baum.
I'm not going to carry you up this hill.
triple-eight has been to that kid's house.
it knows about the school. it has his picture.
how long?
cameron says two, maybe three hours.
she's on her way.
you tolde you'u'throw that kid in a hole.
babysit. nothing complicated.
it won't touch him.
I won't let it.
you better not.
cause if you do,
pray that triple-eight gets to you before I do.
is, uh-- is everything okay?
everything's fine.
look, I'm sorry. I didn't
I didn't mean this.
this was never the plan, ever.
what was the plan?
I don't know.
you can't always have one. not all the time.
sometimes you just do.
and I did.
to you.
well...
you saved my life, right?
so... good plan.
thank you.
I said thank you.
I know. I just...
I haven't heard that in...
I haven't heard that.
you're welcome?
say it.
you're welcome.
now say, "Marty...
let me help you with your book report.
I can't call my mom and...
you're not doing anything.
so...
thank you, Marty.
you're welcome.
tonight's exercise is a rescue extraction.
meet old Fred.
he weighs about 75 pounds,
and needs to be carried from place to place.
this is his life's ambition.
and I intend to help him
forget that! all eyes on me.
seniors...
get your people online.
ten meter spacing. eyes up.
what about the obstacle course?
new exercise.
a guy with a gun is going to come through here.
do not initiate contact.
not even for laughs. are we clear?
you see him, you send a hand signal up the line.
if I see that hand signal before I see our infiltrator,
you win.
exercise over.
and where will you be?
looking for that hand signal.
you're with me.
you too.
those are detonators.
claymore simulators.
here, here, and here.
now you wait for the signal.
you watch for me
to lead the infiltrator past this line.
when he enters the kill zone,
you hit the detonator, simulators go off.
end of story. we go home.
wait, sir.
the last-minute change of mission?
pre-positioned equipment?
claymore simulators?
what?
we're not having fun?
Aw, son of a bitch!
no, no, no, no!
Aw! got to be a little more specific.
straight shot from one of the kids must've.
must've hit one of the f-p's.
it's set them all off, it's a chain reaction.
we're just swinging in the wind.
Where's the ogre?
it's coming to kill us all.
where the hell do you think it is?
where is the tank?
about a block away.
moving towards us.
there's no way we've got enough powder to kill it.
I'm going to lay down some covering fire,
maybe drop a couple endos.
that'll give kyle enough time to get back.
Reese...
we can kill that ogre.
we got one more magic bullet.
we just got to get it out there.
the emerald city was soon left far behind.
as they advanced, "the ground became rougher and hillier.
for there were no farms nor houses "in this country of the west.
before night, "dorothy, and toto, and the lion lay down "upon the grass and fell asleep, "with the woodman and the scarecrow keeping watch.
now, "the wicked witch had but one eye.
yet she could see everywhere.
she saw dorothy lying asleep,
with her friends all about her.
the wicked witch looked out with her one eye.
she said to the king crow, fly at once to those strangers.
peck out their eyes.
tear them to pieces.'
the wild crows flew in one great flock, "toward dorothy and her companions.
when the little girl saw them coming,
she was afraid.
come here.
but the scarecrow said, "'this is my battle, 'lie down beside me and you will not be harmed.'
look over here!
it's me! Connor!
John Connor!
the witch got into a terrible rage.
she couldn't understand how all her plans "to destroy the strangers had failed.
there was only one way left
to destroy dorothy and her friends.
want me to read for awhile?
the sky darkened and a low rumbling sound "was heard in the air.
there was a rushing of many wings, "a great chattering and laughing, "and the sun came out of the dark sky "to show the witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys.
go to the strangers and destroy them all,'
said the wicked witch.
but dorothy they did not harm at all.
careful and gently, they lifted dorothy
in their arms and carried her to the witch.
the witch looked into the child's eyes "and saw how simple the soul behind them was, "and that she did not know of her wonderful power.
the witch said to dorothy, "'come with me;
for if you do not, I will make an end of you.'
the little girl grew angry.
you are a wicked creature!' she cried.
in her anger, she picked up a bucket of water "that stood near and dashed it over the witch, "wetting her from head to foot.
the witch gave a cry of fear.
as dorothy looked in wonder, "the witch began to shrink away.
see what you have done!' the witch screamed.
I shall melt away.'
with these words, she fell "into a melted shapeless ms.
the wicked witch had come to an end.
being at last free to do as she chose, "dorothy ran,
no longer a prisoner in a strange land.
six stops down, there's a pay phone
to call your mom.
you got your money?
if you get into trouble, you call me.
say "book report" and I'll come.
whatever it is, I'll come.
are you a spy?
no, I'm not a spy.
are you a mom?
Yeah, I'm a mom.
you kind of suck at it.
I know. I'm working on it.
let's catch your bus.
so this...
this is what I'm supposed to do?
stay here, graduate, go to west point?
like I don't know the end of the world is coming?
like any of this-- any of it really matters?
it does matter.
it all matters.
you believe that?
I've got to.
I'll see you around, Connor.
Yeah. I guess you will.
sometimes I wish
I could just wake up from all this.
like from a dream.
but I can't, can I?
you want to know what happened...
to bedell-- what really happened?
I don't know. do I?
guess it depends on who I'm talking to.
John Baum or John Connor.
Baum is just a name.
I'll go.
Reese, I run faster than you.
you run like a duck.
you'll never make it.
he's my brother.
you want to save kyle or die trying?
give me the damn e. f.p.
please.
I want to take this one.
run like hell, okay?
bedell, you run like hell.
when this thing goes off, you pop those wagons.
you get those people out.
don't be a hero.
go!
and he ran.
he ran so fast.
fast enough to get to that tank
before it got to kyle's position.
fast enough to blow it sky-high.
we rescued 40 prisoners that day.
one of them was John Connor.
martin was always a great runner.
but n one...
no one could outrun a blast like that.
he died, John .
he died for you.
we all die for you.
a restored film
angels OF SIN
this film was inspired by a French Dominican congregation founded in 1867 by Father Lataste.
the authors are responsible for the story they created, yet also tried to convey, by means of images and details taken from reality, the atmosphere of these convents, and the spirit of their mission.
ave Maria.
we'll have the tall, devoted driver I asked for?
good. Have him wait.
you're excused, you're sick.
please, I'm better. I had to stay in last time.
that's why it didn't work. - Then come. You'll bring us luck.
I made a sketch so we don't make the same mistake as last time.
mother Subprioress will wait in a taxi on the corner.
Yes, Mother.
mother Mistress and I will go to the door.
bring a flashlight, it'll be dark.
Yes, Mother.
if it works, we head for the car.
if there's trouble, we head this way.
mother Mistress's signal will be 3 flashes.
then come meet us this way.
don't worry, Mother St John.
edouard's driving. He's a former boxer.
I ask the community to pray while we're gone, even all night, so as to ensure our success.
inmate 42-16 is here, Mother. She's waiting.
Agnes!
mother, thank you for coming!
ready to follow us?
I've waited all month!
you have your release papers? - Here.
mother...
I know. Someone asked about you, wrote to you.
the letter begged me, threatened me.
don't shake, dear. Have no fear.
anything suspect? - The guard saw prowlers...
wait till his next round.
no, we don't have time. Come, Agnes.
mother, it's him!
I'm Anne-Marie. - Mother Prioress is waiting.
you know the life you'll have here?
a wonderful life, with my outcast sisters.
Yes, sisters in misery.
we welcome those freed from prison.
sins and misfortunes are divine guarantees.
you're from a gentler background, and this is a hard legion.
I must ensure you're up to it. Are you happy?
very. - Healthy?
enough for the world I left.
you bid it farewell? - To an old couple on the train.
and a dog that resembled mine.
I'm ready.
the rehabilitated nuns have the same rights, commitments and religious honor as you.
you agree to live among them, leading the same life, being seen as one of them?
that's why I'm here.
then you're welcome.
so gloomy, Mother St John?
you light up when you like novices.
I won't light up, as you say, today, Mother.
let's hope you do in 2 weeks when she dons her habit with Agnes.
are you ready?
does it suit me?
it does. Look at my face to be sure.
here, our only mirror is another Sister's eyes.
I'm so silly!
mother Dominique!
hurry, they're waiting for us.
mother Dominique, I can't see myself!
what do you ask for?
for God's mercy, and yours.
stand up.
God's mercy is not ours to give, but your gesture leads us to believe you have it.
as for ours, we give it freely.
you have a year to experience our life.
if you don't like it, or we dislike your behavior, you're free to go as we're free to send you away.
approach and join our family.
what should I give you? - Make a sacrifice.
I've only won'thless mementos.
that's why you must give them away.
this belt can replace Sister Marthe's.
give the pen to Sister Beatrice, our secretary.
I've also a gold pencil. For you.
what about these books, letters and photos?
they won't please anyone. Let me keep them.
girls we take from prison keep nothing.
be an example.
just a few days. - As you wish.
when your whole world is your papers, they weigh heavily.
what's wrong? - My mirror's gone, Mother!
it was right here...
it's going around the convent. It's not important.
my chain and pencil are gone, too!
they couldn't have been stolen?
they merely took a special path to Mother Prioress.
stand up.
forgive me for the pain I caused!
but I've been 5 years without a mirror.
who did you see in it?
a thief masquerading as Sister Agnes.
I also stole this chain and pencil.
forgive me. - Go in peace.
if you'll fight against your bad habits, you may stay.
don't be so good to me, I need your severity.
yours is sufficient for today.
mother Prioress kept the mirror. Here's the rest.
they are no longer mine. Give them away.
why did you come here, Sister?
to see you. - We're not interesting.
to see the most miserable of you.
I've a brother, always wanted a sister to have poverty as the family I lack.
it's not a family, it's a sickness. Like leprosy.
to embrace lepers, you need great courage.
or great pride.
some Sisters here think you're proud.
if pride is thinking I was chosen to win over the guiltiest or the most stubborn here, I am.
an angel couldn't win some of them over.
they're those I wish to meet.
I long to go on prison visits with Mother Prioress.
your jail held bad criminals?
it's not those who committed the worst crimes who resist.
there are others. - You had them?
one. Who even we were afraid of.
she was clever and fought hard.
her beauty was twisted by hate.
why was she there? - She was convicted of theft.
what did she tell the Sisters? - Nothing.
what's her name? - Thérèse.
what was that?
we said we have no Sister Thérèse, we need one.
is she still in jail?
her 2 years are almost up.
I beg a favor, Mother.
Yes, my Daughter?
to accompany Mother Prioress to the prison.
you're new. This is unusual. Why?
I feel I'm being called. - Your mission is here.
I must go. Before it's too late.
go to our Founder's grave, Sister.
he'll tell you to seek our peace.
I went. He urged me to do this. - Sister!
forgive me, Mother. - Go.
she's the opposite of what we need. An agitated soul...
but a soul, nonetheless.
we like your daughter, ma'am. - Who wouldn't?
imagine how hard it is to be separated from her.
if she were happy, I'd bow out.
but this convent... I came for her.
you'll see her.
Anne-Marie loves beauty, luxury, cleanliness.
how could she be happy amongst criminals?
I can't imagine being with one.
yet it's easy, ma'am. I'm one of them.
I'm sorry.
we like Anne-Marie, but I'm not holding her.
nor any who haven't taken their vows.
I count my flock each night with anguish.
they're all there.
we'll miss Anne-Marie if she leaves, but we'll abide by that.
thank you. - For what?
saying you were a criminal.
maybe it's bad. It might have been vanity.
Anne-Marie!
you're so beautiful, mother!
I'm so lucky you're my mother.
your hair!
not a strand is missing.
darling!
I came for you. - Came for me?
you won't stay another day.
you said I could.
be devoted to God, not criminals. - What's the difference?
darling! Fight misfortune by doing charity work with me.
you'll help the deprived, who deserve you more.
there are murderesses here!
you don't understand.
what's to understand?
you must be sure of yourself to do what you're doing!
do you not know me, either? You think I'm weak?
dear child!
I'm your child, but I'm strong, mother dear.
I didn't leave the world because it was hard, but because there were no challenges.
I came to fight misery, to help people.
I can do that here. I'm happy here.
but sad I cause you pain.
you can't offer God the suffering of others!
forgive me.
what's wrong, Clotilde? You cried?
I wasrt honest...
the convent's not for you?
we'll find you a job.
I long only for the convent.
but I'm in for 20 years!
so?
I'll be 45 in 20 years, it will be too late!
why too late?
powder, Janine?
plaster. Sorry, Mother.
plaster? - From the wall.
it makes you pale, you've no color.
you'll get some with us.
the Council accepted you.
here, if you want. - Perfect.
you could say hello.
here's one who'll never amount to anything.
she's hopeless.
sorry, Sister! She stained your habit!
no matter. - She did it on purpose!
she stains anything white. Just like her!
come on!
why didn't you speak to her, Mother?
she doesn't want me to.
for her, words come from those who command, punish, insult her.
had we spoken, we'd be the same.
she'd have lumped us with the guard.
blame me for the kiss?
no, you didn't speak, either.
go on!
what is it? - 17-21, sir.
her again?
she looks so sad. - Her own fault.
that rebel was transferred here 3 months ago, for us to change her.
nothing worked.
she screams for days and nights.
she's hostile to all the guards.
why does she rebel? - Listen to her!
17-21 is in the hole, Warden. - Good.
she stays until her release. - When?
in 2 weeks. Unless I isolate her, she'll get extra time!
you're Thérèse?
Yes, I know your name. I say it daily.
say it when I'm gone.
Thérèse.
who sent you?
no one. I'm a Sister to everyone here.
not mine! I'm innocent! Go!
the law makes mistakes.
go see your thieves, I stole nothing!
he set me up!
he made me steal and turned me in.
I'm locked up and he's free!
he has 2 more weeks to be happy.
you'll be free. Do you think...
go! You keep me from screaming!
scream if you wish.
it won't keep me from hearing your pain.
there's one remedy: Forgiveness.
I found another. Found it my first day here.
I've planned it. The guilty can forgive, the innocent get revenge!
too bad for him!
why are you here listening to me?
warden send you for my secrets?
what secrets?
sister Elisabeth, you'll choose the texts, as the youngest.
I'm scared.
of what?
of being the chance that gives each sister the text that will be her motto all year?
there is no chance, Sister. Everything is a sign.
sister Gabrielle.
Pascal:
all things are mystery...
funny, the verses are picked by chance, but they always fit.
St Eulalia called them "miraculous."
sister Berthe.
Angelus Silesius:
love, unannounced, soon has God's ear.
intelligence and wit He takes longer to hear.
mother St John.
St Teresa of Avila:
do not obey my orders, obey my silences.
sister Anne-Marie.
St Catherine of Siena:
if you hear God's word joining you to another, "listen to no other words: They are merely its echo."
what's wrong, Sister? Are you ill?
I hear the word. - Which word?
the word from my text.
I already heard it the other day in the prison.
help me speak to you, Mother.
what I must ask you is difficult.
explain, my child.
that's just it, allow me to not explain.
see Thérèse when she's released!
you're giving orders now, Sister?
it's a humble but insistent prayer.
she needs us, but she won't come here.
we must go to her.
I beg of you.
go.
insufferable child!
to which children did St Benedict tell us to listen sometimes?
the insufferable or the wise?
at 9: 00, Mother. 5 more minutes.
2 minutes, Mr. Roger.
if Mother Prioress' watch says 8: 58, I believe it.
I'll stay here, Mother.
you talk to her, I trust you.
some role you ask me to play!
I must look like a cat waiting by a mouse hole.
here she is!
there should be 350 francs.
it's raining. Want to wait?
go on. You'll manage.
you're young and smart.
above all, don't abuse your freedom. You'll be fine.
Hello, Mother. You're here to see me?
I'm off to court. It's 9 AM.
very well, Warden.
I'm happy you're free. You were here a long time, right?
2 years.
going to your family? - I have none.
friends? - I haven't any.
you live in town?
I live nowhere.
then your solitude allows me to speak to you.
if things get hard, our house is yours.
you're welcome there.
very well, Mother.
if you have any problems, come speak to me.
I'll be happy to help you out.
thank you.
some people won't understand, they'll shut their doors.
farewell, Mother.
Thérèse, come, I beg you.
leave me alone. You're crazy!
I'd like a revolver. - Large caliber?
medium.
I have a Herstahl for 75 or a Reduro for 100 francs.
Reduro's best. Know how the catch works?
no. - Here.
safety to the right, fire to the left.
6 bullets. 12 with the extra clip. Is that enough?
if it's not, I'll come back.
I didn't bring Thérèse back, Mother. You win.
sister Anne-Marie, some feelings are unwelcome here.
Self-Iove is one.
forgive me, but it has the word "love."
so, Thérèse called you crazy?
to tell me I was right. No, Mother?
I'm glad you've such devotion, but don't waste it.
it's for all your Sisters, not just Thérèse.
allow me to speak to You directly.
your Saints will understand why I didn't solicit them.
see me, hear me Yourself.
deliver me from this anguish in my heart.
tell me the task You gave me by letting me hear a poor, tormented soul's secret is but a test from which my greatest joy shall be born.
protect us now and forever.
deliver us from evil...
it's you? Hello. - Hello.
so St Francis said to him:
brother Wolf, you've done great harm in this region.
destroying God's creatures "without His permission.
you not only slay and devour beasts, "you're so brazen as to kill men made in God's image.
so you deserve to be put to death as a thief and murderer.
everyone cries out against you.
what is it?
mother, someone's at the door.
you have good ears, we heard nothing. And then?
and then? - Go on.
everyone cries out against you, "the whole world is your enemy.
brother Wolf, I want to make peace, so you no longer offend them, "and they forgive all past offenses. So neither men nor dogs..."
the door again. Why not open it?
read, Sister.
I'm sure it's Thérèse, Mother!
it's been opened!
Thérèse, my child!
what a lovely surprise. You have something to tell me?
please take me in. - You look sick. We'll care for you.
you'll take me? You won't send me away?
I can't go back, I hate the world.
you speak nonsense. You don't understand.
hate didn't bring you here.
sister Anne-Marie will be happy, she was worried.
worried?
I'm so happy! I knew you'd come!
you called her name loudly. She heard you.
she can stay, right?
the Council will decide. For a few months, on trial.
she's too unwell to leave now.
have you eaten? - I'm not hungry.
take care of her, Sister Anne-Marie.
I was so scared!
scared of what?
of misfortune, of evil.
that you'd gone to seek revenge, but not forgiveness.
but I was sure you'd come.
Why?
by grace.
I'm sure I felt everything you felt yesterday.
you felt my call. I saw you everywhere...
think they'll accept me?
they're all expecting you.
I've made a place for you. Even your habit is ready.
Thérèse, I'll teach you to find true happiness.
teaching a pupil beatitude, being God's seamstress...
you've brought me this gift, thank you.
you have the weapon?
still no leads? - One, it's a woman, of slight build.
she shot in a panic, bottom to top.
two, it's revenge. Nothing was stolen.
no prints is the print of revenge.
revenge!
start with his friends!
all this joy, songs, festivity are for you, rewards for your suffering.
we werert Sister Thérèse, yet had the same ceremony.
and in your new robe you've stayed the same.
true. - I'd recognize her with a veil.
my hair shows? Why wasrt it cut?
our last tie to the world isn't cut till we take our vows.
my name wasrt changed?
out of respect for you. At my request.
Why?
it's none of your business.
be careful, you took a bad pupil.
she's more trouble than you think for your place in heaven.
2 PM, in the laundry room.
at 2, Sister Anne-Marie and I sing.
she's taking care of you.
at 5, she reads me The Golden Legend.
at 7, she has me say a special prayer.
she gives you much of her time.
her time, heart, and soul. Too much!
show her she's going too far.
she doesn't understand.
you came here for her. Seeing you is her reward.
she shows me off like a curiosity.
with all of her lessons, I feel like I'm being exhibited!
she's really exhibiting herself.
there's the devil!
horrible Blackie!
what's that?
Blackie, Mother St Johrs cat.
show me your eyes, Sister Thérèse.
that's not quite it.
your eyes aren't joyful.
I've shown you how.
it doesn't work.
that's what worries me. Your eyes don't change.
I've an idea, come on. - Where?
to the garden. You'll cut flowers for the altar.
sister Marie-Josèhehe can come.
Yes, Reverend Mother!
to show me what flowers are?
no, what a bouquet for God is.
we'll innovate. Instead of the usual mixed bunches, we'll make bouquets with roses, carnations and lilies.
know the language of flowers?
no. - I'll teach you.
I haven't much to tell them... - Sister Anne-Marie!
where are you going? - To the garden.
you were excused from your duties?
this is urgent. - Obey the rules!
rules? This is the one place where the heart rules!
I'll report this to the Chapter of Faults.
my heart won't proclaim.
go to your cell, Sister Anne-Marie. I'll take Sister Thérèse today.
anything new? - No.
you? I'm not surprised.
you think criminals return to the crime scene.
they're no longer that considerate. They're too busy!
and you?
one lead. A woman friend released from jail the day he was killed.
what's she got to say? - She's vanished.
got a description? - Yes, and photos.
why are you beating your laundry by hand?
St Hildegard did. She respected everything white.
wort make you a Saint.
why not? That's why we're here.
all but you. You're a lay sister, lay sisters aren't canonized.
if I chose the lay sisters, there'd be saints galore.
like Anne-Marie?
why not?
St Gertrude said: "Happiness begets saintliness.
she's the happiest one here.
it's nice to see her happy.
and so self-confident.
she should be careful.
maybe we should warn her.
about what?
the Superiors admire her.
as do we.
but she worries them.
they think she's self-centered.
she's unaware of the danger.
she's in no great danger. - Yes, she is.
no more than us, we're still here.
we're imperfect by nature.
but rehabilitated sisters must be flawless.
she's so nervous, she makes a scene over anything.
want a place, Sister Thérèse? - Thank you.
you look worried, Sister Thérèse.
I don't think so. - Yes, what's wrong?
I'd best not tell you.
very well.
sister Anne-Marie!
there's a conspiracy against you.
a conspiracy? Don't say that word, it's bad.
you're denied prison visits.
we take turns! - Mother St John banned you.
who says so? - Everyone does. She's wrong.
the others lack your gifts.
mother Prioress knows.
she loves us all.
you're her favorite.
she likes your spontaneity, your enthusiasm.
my enthusiasm?
your impulsiveness.
everything Mother St John hates.
I heard you singing, it's a call I can't resist.
it's not exactly a hymn, Sister. I heard you whistling.
it's the prettiest hymn of all, the finches' song.
we don't have songbirds in cages?
nightingales and finches love liberty.
we mustrt cage them!
your cell's untidy.
it's even a bit dusty.
flowers cheer it up. - Pretty.
but the rules also say we may not cage flowers.
they begged me to pick them.
if every pretty thing begged to be in a Dominican cell, where would we be?
every pretty thing is in mine, I collect them.
hence the untidiness.
the beauty in my books so awed me that I replaced them badly.
I awoke to such a fine day that my bed's unmade.
your head's so full of pretty images your hair sticks out.
mere details...
there are no details in life.
saints treat all duties the same way.
details are born of negligence.
job wasrt clean, sitting on manure.
were he here, he'd make his bed and wash his eyes in 2 hours!
unless your cat left him a gift!
don't pick on Blackie. He's ugly, but rids us of mice.
where'll I put the flowers? Now they're unwon'thy of the chapel.
you see, you kept them from their mission, made them yours.
we'll take them to the cemetery.
the dead like what belonged to the living.
don't dedicate your days to Sister Thérèse, neglecting others and yourself.
abandoning her is a betrayal!
to? - God and myself.
mother St John knows very well who betrays and who is loyal.
play anything, tell riddles.
I only know one.
which one?
what goes up white and falls yellow?
I know: The sun.
Why?
it's a Dominican.
what is it? - An egg.
mine's funnier.
what's worse, dust on furniture or the soul?
why that question?
mother St John thinks dusty tables shock God.
And?
I think He's more offended by dust on the soul.
dust on the soul?
hypocrisy, for instance.
why this example? It's not a casual choice.
no, it isn't.
a dusty table is better than Sisters petting Blackie and cursing him behind Mother St Johrs back.
right, Sister Marie-Josèhehe?
me? What did I do?
sister Colette?
sister Anne-Marie, bring your criticisms to the Chapter of Faults.
it's not a matter for recreation time.
you know that. I disapprove.
don't be so harsh!
I'm sure you and my Sisters agree.
there's a way to find out what we think. Request it.
sisterly correction! I'd be happy to do that.
sisterly correction, Sister Henri.
what do you think of me? - Good, but stubborn.
unpretentious, but proud. Intelligent, but excitable.
is that bad?
I'm here to enlighten you, not to judge you.
sister Jacques?
you're hot-tempered, prejudiced and vain.
irascible. - Thank you, Sister Jacques.
sister Thérèse?
how do you value me?
above the others.
it's not about you. I'm vain, right?
you're outspoken, but ashamed.
full of self-Iove? - You want others to like you.
I'm edgy, messy, stubborn?
you're loyal, you're yourself.
sister Madeleine?
you think highly of yourself.
you don't understand people.
not Madeleine, Sister Madeleine.
coquettish, ambitious, stubborn.
that's not true!
why do you all say this?
we all feel the same.
the others could be mistaken, but not you!
I thought you knew me. I thought you loved me.
you had ready the words that hurt me most.
your anger is like town gossip!
we're in God's light here.
thoughts and actions have a higher meaning.
and you behave like ants!
you're unwon'thy.
thank you, Sister.
you're jealous. You're mean.
I know.
you show me my flaws, I believe you.
but there's only one voice that I shall obey.
no one can stop me.
...suffered at the hands of many, "even those whom she'd most helped in her days of prosperity."
among them was an old woman "who had received food and mercy from the Saint during a famine.
meeting her in the street, "that they had to cross on a plank because of the sludge, the miserable woman pushed her benefactress, who fell into the mud."
she was thus exposed to disgrace and mockery, "to which the Saint responded..."
what is it?
stop petting Blackie.
...happy to suffer such humiliation out of love for Jesus Christ, "who fills the hearts of the faithful with consolation..."
I proclaim Sister Anne-Marie for mistreating an animal.
for penance, she'll read the Litanies.
I did not yield the way to an older Sister on entering the Chapter.
proclamations for Marie-Josèhehe?
Yes, for petting an animal.
what?
in the workshop... - No explanations here.
for penance, this week she'll enter last for services.
I laughed and turned around in chapel.
any proclamations for Sister Colette?
I proclaim her for petting an animal.
she'll sweep the chapel.
I am guilty of interrupting a Sister.
proclamations for Sister Thomas?
for petting an animal.
cease your proclamations!
the Council doesn't understand your proclamations.
mother St John surely does.
explain! You can't proclaim Sisters for petting animals.
they pet the Devil! - That's nonsense.
it's true, that beast came to hurt us.
it's an innocent animal.
it's Beelzebub! He should be judged.
because of him, Sisters commit mortal sins.
they rightly hate him.
he steals, hates us all, is a burden.
but Mother St John likes him.
they pet him for her, kick him behind her back.
Beelzebub proudly walks around.
look in his eyes, see a path of lies and hypocrisy!
sister!
a bluebird used to come here, it brought joy and sincerity.
and a toad that made us feel compassionate.
mother St Johrs cat ate them.
I'd proclaim her if I could, for not opposing it.
leave. You'll learn your penance in the refectory.
I impose a public penance for the scandal she caused.
sister Anne-Marie will kiss all her Sisters' feet.
when the appointed time had come, "the Son of God, "after 30 years of silence, "went forth to sow the celestial seed "of His Divine message...
I demand the rule be enforced.
she knows if she refuses she may be sent away?
she does.
sister, do you refuse you penance?
continue reading.
when the appointed time had come, the Son of God, "after 30 years of silence...
where will I go?
your family is expecting you. - My family!
I gave up that world.
sending me back is unfair.
my dear child...
I loved the world I left.
you don't know how much I loved it.
I ripped it from my heart to come here.
it was horrible, but I did.
I'll never again find peace there.
you force me to return to what will only be unappiness.
I beg of you, keep me.
I'm sorry, Anne-Marie.
my God, I'm no longer Sister Anne-Marie.
God knows you have no better friend than me.
I've esteem for your character, but there's no advantage for the community if you stay.
I'm asking for a huge sacrifice, but consider it to be a sacrifice and not a penance.
farewell, Mother.
is it raining?
no, my umbrella ensures sunshine.
very wise.
our prison visits are always rainy.
Yes, this is the convent.
mother, it's Anne-Marie's family! She hasn't returned.
she said nothing? - No.
Hello?
Yes, Anne-Marie left that day.
she was well.
no, I'm not worried. She's like that.
I'll ask around. I'll call you back.
you're really not worried?
let's ask Sister Madeleine.
sister Madeleine!
Yes, Mother?
did Anne-Marie say where she'd go?
she didn't return to her family? I knew it!
she said nothing?
no, nothing.
let's not be late.
you're holding the saw wrong, Sister.
get closer, bend over it, unless you want to tire yourself.
did you grease the saw?
sister Marie-Josehe, your woodpile will collapse.
Yes, Reverend Mother.
why "Reverend Mother"?
why can't you do anything right today?
unlike you, since Sister Anne-Marie left!
you're overjoyed that she's gone!
what's she have to do with it?
I'll tell you: You drove her away!
I don't know why or how, but you did.
you hated her, you're glad she's gone! She was too good!
you set her against Mother St John.
you're such a hypocrite,
I feel like hitting you!
what's going on?
two Sisters chatter instead of working!
sister Therese, oversee them.
it's already done.
you've a full hall, Mother, 30 applicants.
anyone new? - One who's surprising.
each prison has a rebel.
it used to be 17-21. Remember Therese?
another wants to see you.
let's go.
I got a call about Therese.
a friend of hers was murdered.
shot. The police are looking for her.
she must know the motive.
she may be an accomplice.
I wouldn't be surprised if she did it.
no one here would be if she killed herself, too.
do you remember her? Remember the scene she caused?
I remember very well.
council meeting, at once!
mother Prioress is back from prison sooner than usual.
we can't take risks for someone trying to save herself.
in the here and now or the hereafter?
vocations are often bred of crime.
true, Mother.
we must not concern ourselves with her guilt, but with her redemption.
I have great doubt as to that.
Why? She's obedient and follows the rules.
if only they were all so easy...
I'm not afraid of scandal, as you well know.
we must reach a decision, her trial period is over.
we won't turn her in, or abandon her.
but after having had to expel a pure soul like Anne-Marie,
I can't be lenient in this doubtful case.
I could find a religious home to protect her and give her work.
do it fast.
someone's trespassing, there's a hole in the hedge.
someone stealing our peaches. - No.
sister Agnes, who once stole them, now checks them.
none missing.
anything odd in the convent?
not so far. - Any footprints?
I saw none... but you may.
I'm flattered to be promoted to detective.
our Founding Father's here, what could go wrong?
Yes, someone came through.
someone who didn't fear the nettles.
it's a small hole. Maybe a lamb...
I'll fill it up with thorns tonight.
you, in your sleepless slumber, whose eyes see all of us, thank you for receiving me each night!
the hole was full of thorns tonight.
the others think I am an intruder who comes to steal a little eternal peace, but I shall always be your Daughter.
when I leave my barn to come here, the path that brings me to you is as wide as the world.
you are not yet a Saint.
you wanted to share our misery for as long as possible as a simple human being, as our Brother.
that is why, before my prayers, I beseech you...
help me! My punishment was too severe.
and Therese...
Therese, who you entrusted to me...
allow me to hear her voice in this song, as I am no longer allowed to sing...
is she dead? - She's breathing.
but she's so cold.
sister Anne-Marie!
let's take her to the infirmary.
you won't kiss her?
Therese?
she's here, hush. You'll see her.
she came through the hedge. - Every night.
she's very sick.
what does the doctor say?
there's no hope. Her heart may give out any moment.
such fine news I hear!
did Mother Prioress tell you?
she says I'm dying. - Sister Anne-Marie!
convents panic. They give you Extreme Unction for a cold.
this will be my first Extreme Unction.
you must tell her. She can't go without knowing.
she doesn't want to know.
how strange not to sense death approaching.
it's horrible to have to tell her.
but I can try again...
don't forget my penance, Mother.
I must do it fast.
my Sisters' feet keep passing in a procession before me.
of course. When you're able.
see, you're granting me a respite.
don't be sad, Mother.
I assure you, God couldn't be so cruel...
as to give me such an important mission...
and only allow me to throw a cat into the hall.
he wouldn't allow it.
he knows what He's doing. We've only to wait.
I'm waiting, Mother.
well?
Therese won't leave yet.
Therese? - Anne-Marie's holding on for her.
that's why she thinks she can cheat death.
we can't separate them now, when their game is unfolding.
you hate me, don't you?
why would I?
because I treated you badly.
you had good intentions.
I behaved foolishly.
as if I could teach you, when, in fact, I knew nothing.
I was foolish.
no, you werert.
my only excuse is that I did it out of love for you.
I thought I knew you, but I didn't.
no harm, I'm not interesting.
you are.
you alone interest me.
I know that now.
I know why you're here. - I think not.
I made you lie to me, tell me you came because of me.
it was childish of me.
don't speak so much.
you came to hide.
from whom?
from whom or what isn't my concern.
something horrible happened to you when you got out.
you saw your world aflame, you saw a ghost...
you came here to hide. - Not true.
instead of abandoning life, you abandoned the world.
I should have helped you, but I didn't.
I made you into the Prodigal Child.
I dragged you into the light.
cried out your name to all, to God...
I was grotesque. - Sister!
I strutted proudly beside you...
you, who had been flayed alive.
I now see what you needed.
though it may be too late. - What did I need?
a silent presence, someone to stop your tears with silence, and your suffering by her presence.
simply a friend.
a friend... Why are you getting up?
because I'm leaving.
I don't want to be near you!
you're lying again!
you're trying something else on me!
prestige wasrt enough. Now friendship!
no, you don't understand.
there's one cure for my suffering: Indifference.
flayed, that's right.
you can't caress the flayed, or dress the flayed...
God, when can I be alone?
you are.
that's what hurts so much.
it's me, Therese.
I see you.
I'm not getting better, am I?
there must be a cure.
there is one cure. It'll work.
tell Mother Prioress.
our Mother can't help.
I'm dying because I failed to get what I wanted.
you're too ambitious.
maybe so.
you thought the world was pretty, that life had hope.
I still do.
I thought I'd heal a broken heart.
a broken heart can be healed, but not a dead one.
if I thought I could do it, I'd live.
it may take 100 years.
then I'd live 100 years.
you look better.
Yes. Maybe it's the first day of my 100 years.
is that you, Mother?
I was right the other day,
Therese is the killer.
Yes, I assure you.
the gunsmith...
the gunsmith who sold the gun recognized her photo.
sorry I had to tell them you had contact with her.
they'll have to come to the convent.
let go of my hand! - It helps me.
that's not why you hold it, you want to know what it did.
your hand is a question.
then answer it.
you pry into my eyes, watch my gestures!
even when you pretend to sleep, I know you listen to my steps.
you spy for Mother Prioress!
sister Therese! - Look at this face.
look at it well, and remember what you see. You'll never see it again!
I can't go on.
you know my secret now. Are you glad?
you held my hands to handcuff them.
go ahead! Turn me in!
if I speak of you, it won't be in this world.
no one in the convent will turn you in.
but you can't keep living a lie, or deceive our Mother.
I can't get up, Sister Therese.
please tell Mother Prioress.
I'm going.
beloved Sister, we entrust you to Almighty God, "who created you from the dust you return to."
now your soul shall leave your body.
shining angels are ready to greet you.
the Apostles shall judge you.
the triumphant, white army of martyrs is coming toward you.
the choir of virgins draws you into the blissful sleep of the patriarchs.
the Holy Mother of God...
Yes, I am ready.
I said goodbye to an old woman.
what did she say? Can she pronounce her vows?
she's delirious. We'll wait.
the Sister with birds!
you swim so fast, I can't keep up!
I feel so ill.
I feel so wonderful.
she's dying!
Yes, sing the Salve Regina.
the police. Tell Mother Prioress.
the police!
the police.
let them wait.
let them wait. I've waited, too.
mother Prioress will fix everything.
sister Anne-Marie, can you take your solemn vows?
Yes, Mother. But hurry...
the Book of Constitutions.
I, Sister Anne-Marie, profess to you...
I can't speak...
Therese...
I, Sister Anne-Marie, profess to you...
that I shall obey...
God, the Most Holy Virgin Mary, the Blessed Patriarch Dominic, and you, my Mother, according to our rule.
and I shall remain obedient until my death...
see you soon, Sister.
a restored film
angels OF SIN
this film was inspired by a French Dominican congregation founded in 1867 by Father Lataste.
the authors are responsible for the story they created, yet also tried to convey, by means of images and details taken from reality, the atmosphere of these convents, and the spirit of their mission.
ave Maria.
we'll have the tall, devoted driver I asked for?
good. Have him wait.
you're excused, you're sick.
please, I'm better. I had to stay in last time.
that's why it didn't work. - Then come. You'll bring us luck.
I made a sketch so we don't make the same mistake as last time.
mother Subprioress will wait in a taxi on the corner.
Yes, Mother.
mother Mistress and I will go to the door.
bring a flashlight, it'll be dark.
Yes, Mother.
if it works, we head for the car.
if there's trouble, we head this way.
mother Mistress's signal will be 3 flashes.
then come meet us this way.
don't worry, Mother St John.
edouard's driving. He's a former boxer.
I ask the community to pray while we're gone, even all night, so as to ensure our success.
inmate 42-16 is here, Mother. She's waiting.
Agnes!
mother, thank you for coming!
ready to follow us?
I've waited all month!
you have your release papers? - Here.
mother...
I know. Someone asked about you, wrote to you.
the letter begged me, threatened me.
don't shake, dear. Have no fear.
anything suspect? - The guard saw prowlers...
wait till his next round.
no, we don't have time. Come, Agnes.
mother, it's him!
I'm Anne-Marie. - Mother Prioress is waiting.
you know the life you'll have here?
a wonderful life, with my outcast sisters.
Yes, sisters in misery.
we welcome those freed from prison.
sins and misfortunes are divine guarantees.
you're from a gentler background, and this is a hard legion.
I must ensure you're up to it. Are you happy?
very. - Healthy?
enough for the world I left.
you bid it farewell? - To an old couple on the train.
and a dog that resembled mine.
I'm ready.
the rehabilitated nuns have the same rights, commitments and religious honor as you.
you agree to live among them, leading the same life, being seen as one of them?
that's why I'm here.
then you're welcome.
so gloomy, Mother St John?
you light up when you like novices.
I won't light up, as you say, today, Mother.
let's hope you do in 2 weeks when she dons her habit with Agnes.
are you ready?
does it suit me?
it does. Look at my face to be sure.
here, our only mirror is another Sister's eyes.
I'm so silly!
mother Dominique!
hurry, they're waiting for us.
mother Dominique, I can't see myself!
what do you ask for?
for God's mercy, and yours.
stand up.
God's mercy is not ours to give, but your gesture leads us to believe you have it.
as for ours, we give it freely.
you have a year to experience our life.
if you don't like it, or we dislike your behavior, you're free to go as we're free to send you away.
approach and join our family.
what should I give you? - Make a sacrifice.
I've only won'thless mementos.
that's why you must give them away.
this belt can replace Sister Marthe's.
give the pen to Sister Beatrice, our secretary.
I've also a gold pencil. For you.
what about these books, letters and photos?
they won't please anyone. Let me keep them.
girls we take from prison keep nothing.
be an example.
just a few days. - As you wish.
when your whole world is your papers, they weigh heavily.
what's wrong? - My mirror's gone, Mother!
it was right here...
it's going around the convent. It's not important.
my chain and pencil are gone, too!
they couldn't have been stolen?
they merely took a special path to Mother Prioress.
stand up.
forgive me for the pain I caused!
but I've been 5 years without a mirror.
who did you see in it?
a thief masquerading as Sister Agnes.
I also stole this chain and pencil.
forgive me. - Go in peace.
if you'll fight against your bad habits, you may stay.
don't be so good to me, I need your severity.
yours is sufficient for today.
mother Prioress kept the mirror. Here's the rest.
they are no longer mine. Give them away.
why did you come here, Sister?
to see you. - We're not interesting.
to see the most miserable of you.
I've a brother, always wanted a sister to have poverty as the family I lack.
it's not a family, it's a sickness. Like leprosy.
to embrace lepers, you need great courage.
or great pride.
some Sisters here think you're proud.
if pride is thinking I was chosen to win over the guiltiest or the most stubborn here, I am.
an angel couldn't win some of them over.
they're those I wish to meet.
I long to go on prison visits with Mother Prioress.
your jail held bad criminals?
it's not those who committed the worst crimes who resist.
there are others. - You had them?
one. Who even we were afraid of.
she was clever and fought hard.
her beauty was twisted by hate.
why was she there? - She was convicted of theft.
what did she tell the Sisters? - Nothing.
what's her name? - Thérèse.
what was that?
we said we have no Sister Thérèse, we need one.
is she still in jail?
her 2 years are almost up.
I beg a favor, Mother.
Yes, my Daughter?
to accompany Mother Prioress to the prison.
you're new. This is unusual. Why?
I feel I'm being called. - Your mission is here.
I must go. Before it's too late.
go to our Founder's grave, Sister.
he'll tell you to seek our peace.
I went. He urged me to do this. - Sister!
forgive me, Mother. - Go.
she's the opposite of what we need. An agitated soul...
but a soul, nonetheless.
we like your daughter, ma'am. - Who wouldn't?
imagine how hard it is to be separated from her.
if she were happy, I'd bow out.
but this convent... I came for her.
you'll see her.
Anne-Marie loves beauty, luxury, cleanliness.
how could she be happy amongst criminals?
I can't imagine being with one.
yet it's easy, ma'am. I'm one of them.
I'm sorry.
we like Anne-Marie, but I'm not holding her.
nor any who haven't taken their vows.
I count my flock each night with anguish.
they're all there.
we'll miss Anne-Marie if she leaves, but we'll abide by that.
thank you. - For what?
saying you were a criminal.
maybe it's bad. It might have been vanity.
Anne-Marie!
you're so beautiful, mother!
I'm so lucky you're my mother.
your hair!
not a strand is missing.
darling!
I came for you. - Came for me?
you won't stay another day.
you said I could.
be devoted to God, not criminals. - What's the difference?
darling! Fight misfortune by doing charity work with me.
you'll help the deprived, who deserve you more.
there are murderesses here!
you don't understand.
what's to understand?
you must be sure of yourself to do what you're doing!
do you not know me, either? You think I'm weak?
dear child!
I'm your child, but I'm strong, mother dear.
I didn't leave the world because it was hard, but because there were no challenges.
I came to fight misery, to help people.
I can do that here. I'm happy here.
but sad I cause you pain.
you can't offer God the suffering of others!
forgive me.
what's wrong, Clotilde? You cried?
I wasrt honest...
the convent's not for you?
we'll find you a job.
I long only for the convent.
but I'm in for 20 years!
so?
I'll be 45 in 20 years, it will be too late!
why too late?
powder, Janine?
plaster. Sorry, Mother.
plaster? - From the wall.
it makes you pale, you've no color.
you'll get some with us.
the Council accepted you.
here, if you want. - Perfect.
you could say hello.
here's one who'll never amount to anything.
she's hopeless.
sorry, Sister! She stained your habit!
no matter. - She did it on purpose!
she stains anything white. Just like her!
come on!
why didn't you speak to her, Mother?
she doesn't want me to.
for her, words come from those who command, punish, insult her.
had we spoken, we'd be the same.
she'd have lumped us with the guard.
blame me for the kiss?
no, you didn't speak, either.
go on!
what is it? - 17-21, sir.
her again?
she looks so sad. - Her own fault.
that rebel was transferred here 3 months ago, for us to change her.
nothing worked.
she screams for days and nights.
she's hostile to all the guards.
why does she rebel? - Listen to her!
17-21 is in the hole, Warden. - Good.
she stays until her release. - When?
in 2 weeks. Unless I isolate her, she'll get extra time!
you're Thérèse?
Yes, I know your name. I say it daily.
say it when I'm gone.
Thérèse.
who sent you?
no one. I'm a Sister to everyone here.
not mine! I'm innocent! Go!
the law makes mistakes.
go see your thieves, I stole nothing!
he set me up!
he made me steal and turned me in.
I'm locked up and he's free!
he has 2 more weeks to be happy.
you'll be free. Do you think...
go! You keep me from screaming!
scream if you wish.
it won't keep me from hearing your pain.
there's one remedy: Forgiveness.
I found another. Found it my first day here.
I've planned it. The guilty can forgive, the innocent get revenge!
too bad for him!
why are you here listening to me?
warden send you for my secrets?
what secrets?
sister Elisabeth, you'll choose the texts, as the youngest.
I'm scared.
of what?
of being the chance that gives each sister the text that will be her motto all year?
there is no chance, Sister. Everything is a sign.
sister Gabrielle.
Pascal:
all things are mystery...
funny, the verses are picked by chance, but they always fit.
St Eulalia called them "miraculous."
sister Berthe.
Angelus Silesius:
love, unannounced, soon has God's ear.
intelligence and wit He takes longer to hear.
mother St John.
St Teresa of Avila:
do not obey my orders, obey my silences.
sister Anne-Marie.
St Catherine of Siena:
if you hear God's word joining you to another, "listen to no other words: They are merely its echo."
what's wrong, Sister? Are you ill?
I hear the word. - Which word?
the word from my text.
I already heard it the other day in the prison.
help me speak to you, Mother.
what I must ask you is difficult.
explain, my child.
that's just it, allow me to not explain.
see Thérèse when she's released!
you're giving orders now, Sister?
it's a humble but insistent prayer.
she needs us, but she won't come here.
we must go to her.
I beg of you.
go.
insufferable child!
to which children did St Benedict tell us to listen sometimes?
the insufferable or the wise?
at 9: 00, Mother. 5 more minutes.
2 minutes, Mr. Roger.
if Mother Prioress' watch says 8: 58, I believe it.
I'll stay here, Mother.
you talk to her, I trust you.
some role you ask me to play!
I must look like a cat waiting by a mouse hole.
here she is!
there should be 350 francs.
it's raining. Want to wait?
go on. You'll manage.
you're young and smart.
above all, don't abuse your freedom. You'll be fine.
Hello, Mother. You're here to see me?
I'm off to court. It's 9 AM.
very well, Warden.
I'm happy you're free. You were here a long time, right?
2 years.
going to your family? - I have none.
friends? - I haven't any.
you live in town?
I live nowhere.
then your solitude allows me to speak to you.
if things get hard, our house is yours.
you're welcome there.
very well, Mother.
if you have any problems, come speak to me.
I'll be happy to help you out.
thank you.
some people won't understand, they'll shut their doors.
farewell, Mother.
Thérèse, come, I beg you.
leave me alone. You're crazy!
I'd like a revolver. - Large caliber?
medium.
I have a Herstahl for 75 or a Reduro for 100 francs.
Reduro's best. Know how the catch works?
no. - Here.
safety to the right, fire to the left.
6 bullets. 12 with the extra clip. Is that enough?
if it's not, I'll come back.
I didn't bring Thérèse back, Mother. You win.
sister Anne-Marie, some feelings are unwelcome here.
Self-Iove is one.
forgive me, but it has the word "love."
so, Thérèse called you crazy?
to tell me I was right. No, Mother?
I'm glad you've such devotion, but don't waste it.
it's for all your Sisters, not just Thérèse.
allow me to speak to You directly.
your Saints will understand why I didn't solicit them.
see me, hear me Yourself.
deliver me from this anguish in my heart.
tell me the task You gave me by letting me hear a poor, tormented soul's secret is but a test from which my greatest joy shall be born.
protect us now and forever.
deliver us from evil...
it's you? Hello. - Hello.
so St Francis said to him:
brother Wolf, you've done great harm in this region.
destroying God's creatures "without His permission.
you not only slay and devour beasts, "you're so brazen as to kill men made in God's image.
so you deserve to be put to death as a thief and murderer.
everyone cries out against you.
what is it?
mother, someone's at the door.
you have good ears, we heard nothing. And then?
and then? - Go on.
everyone cries out against you, "the whole world is your enemy.
brother Wolf, I want to make peace, so you no longer offend them, "and they forgive all past offenses. So neither men nor dogs..."
the door again. Why not open it?
read, Sister.
I'm sure it's Thérèse, Mother!
it's been opened!
Thérèse, my child!
what a lovely surprise. You have something to tell me?
please take me in. - You look sick. We'll care for you.
you'll take me? You won't send me away?
I can't go back, I hate the world.
you speak nonsense. You don't understand.
hate didn't bring you here.
sister Anne-Marie will be happy, she was worried.
worried?
I'm so happy! I knew you'd come!
you called her name loudly. She heard you.
she can stay, right?
the Council will decide. For a few months, on trial.
she's too unwell to leave now.
have you eaten? - I'm not hungry.
take care of her, Sister Anne-Marie.
I was so scared!
scared of what?
of misfortune, of evil.
that you'd gone to seek revenge, but not forgiveness.
but I was sure you'd come.
Why?
by grace.
I'm sure I felt everything you felt yesterday.
you felt my call. I saw you everywhere...
think they'll accept me?
they're all expecting you.
I've made a place for you. Even your habit is ready.
Thérèse, I'll teach you to find true happiness.
teaching a pupil beatitude, being God's seamstress...
you've brought me this gift, thank you.
you have the weapon?
still no leads? - One, it's a woman, of slight build.
she shot in a panic, bottom to top.
two, it's revenge. Nothing was stolen.
no prints is the print of revenge.
revenge!
start with his friends!
all this joy, songs, festivity are for you, rewards for your suffering.
we werert Sister Thérèse, yet had the same ceremony.
and in your new robe you've stayed the same.
true. - I'd recognize her with a veil.
my hair shows? Why wasrt it cut?
our last tie to the world isn't cut till we take our vows.
my name wasrt changed?
out of respect for you. At my request.
Why?
it's none of your business.
be careful, you took a bad pupil.
she's more trouble than you think for your place in heaven.
2 PM, in the laundry room.
at 2, Sister Anne-Marie and I sing.
she's taking care of you.
at 5, she reads me The Golden Legend.
at 7, she has me say a special prayer.
she gives you much of her time.
her time, heart, and soul. Too much!
show her she's going too far.
she doesn't understand.
you came here for her. Seeing you is her reward.
she shows me off like a curiosity.
with all of her lessons, I feel like I'm being exhibited!
she's really exhibiting herself.
there's the devil!
horrible Blackie!
what's that?
Blackie, Mother St Johrs cat.
show me your eyes, Sister Thérèse.
that's not quite it.
your eyes aren't joyful.
I've shown you how.
it doesn't work.
that's what worries me. Your eyes don't change.
I've an idea, come on. - Where?
to the garden. You'll cut flowers for the altar.
sister Marie-Josèhehe can come.
Yes, Reverend Mother!
to show me what flowers are?
no, what a bouquet for God is.
we'll innovate. Instead of the usual mixed bunches, we'll make bouquets with roses, carnations and lilies.
know the language of flowers?
no. - I'll teach you.
I haven't much to tell them... - Sister Anne-Marie!
where are you going? - To the garden.
you were excused from your duties?
this is urgent. - Obey the rules!
rules? This is the one place where the heart rules!
I'll report this to the Chapter of Faults.
my heart won't proclaim.
go to your cell, Sister Anne-Marie. I'll take Sister Thérèse today.
anything new? - No.
you? I'm not surprised.
you think criminals return to the crime scene.
they're no longer that considerate. They're too busy!
and you?
one lead. A woman friend released from jail the day he was killed.
what's she got to say? - She's vanished.
got a description? - Yes, and photos.
why are you beating your laundry by hand?
St Hildegard did. She respected everything white.
wort make you a Saint.
why not? That's why we're here.
all but you. You're a lay sister, lay sisters aren't canonized.
if I chose the lay sisters, there'd be saints galore.
like Anne-Marie?
why not?
St Gertrude said: "Happiness begets saintliness.
she's the happiest one here.
it's nice to see her happy.
and so self-confident.
she should be careful.
maybe we should warn her.
about what?
the Superiors admire her.
as do we.
but she worries them.
they think she's self-centered.
she's unaware of the danger.
she's in no great danger. - Yes, she is.
no more than us, we're still here.
we're imperfect by nature.
but rehabilitated sisters must be flawless.
she's so nervous, she makes a scene over anything.
want a place, Sister Thérèse? - Thank you.
you look worried, Sister Thérèse.
I don't think so. - Yes, what's wrong?
I'd best not tell you.
very well.
sister Anne-Marie!
there's a conspiracy against you.
a conspiracy? Don't say that word, it's bad.
you're denied prison visits.
we take turns! - Mother St John banned you.
who says so? - Everyone does. She's wrong.
the others lack your gifts.
mother Prioress knows.
she loves us all.
you're her favorite.
she likes your spontaneity, your enthusiasm.
my enthusiasm?
your impulsiveness.
everything Mother St John hates.
I heard you singing, it's a call I can't resist.
it's not exactly a hymn, Sister. I heard you whistling.
it's the prettiest hymn of all, the finches' song.
we don't have songbirds in cages?
nightingales and finches love liberty.
we mustrt cage them!
your cell's untidy.
it's even a bit dusty.
flowers cheer it up. - Pretty.
but the rules also say we may not cage flowers.
they begged me to pick them.
if every pretty thing begged to be in a Dominican cell, where would we be?
every pretty thing is in mine, I collect them.
hence the untidiness.
the beauty in my books so awed me that I replaced them badly.
I awoke to such a fine day that my bed's unmade.
your head's so full of pretty images your hair sticks out.
mere details...
there are no details in life.
saints treat all duties the same way.
details are born of negligence.
job wasrt clean, sitting on manure.
were he here, he'd make his bed and wash his eyes in 2 hours!
unless your cat left him a gift!
don't pick on Blackie. He's ugly, but rids us of mice.
where'll I put the flowers? Now they're unwon'thy of the chapel.
you see, you kept them from their mission, made them yours.
we'll take them to the cemetery.
the dead like what belonged to the living.
don't dedicate your days to Sister Thérèse, neglecting others and yourself.
abandoning her is a betrayal!
to? - God and myself.
mother St John knows very well who betrays and who is loyal.
play anything, tell riddles.
I only know one.
which one?
what goes up white and falls yellow?
I know: The sun.
Why?
it's a Dominican.
what is it? - An egg.
mine's funnier.
what's worse, dust on furniture or the soul?
why that question?
mother St John thinks dusty tables shock God.
And?
I think He's more offended by dust on the soul.
dust on the soul?
hypocrisy, for instance.
why this example? It's not a casual choice.
no, it isn't.
a dusty table is better than Sisters petting Blackie and cursing him behind Mother St Johrs back.
right, Sister Marie-Josèhehe?
me? What did I do?
sister Colette?
sister Anne-Marie, bring your criticisms to the Chapter of Faults.
it's not a matter for recreation time.
you know that. I disapprove.
don't be so harsh!
I'm sure you and my Sisters agree.
there's a way to find out what we think. Request it.
sisterly correction! I'd be happy to do that.
sisterly correction, Sister Henri.
what do you think of me? - Good, but stubborn.
unpretentious, but proud. Intelligent, but excitable.
is that bad?
I'm here to enlighten you, not to judge you.
sister Jacques?
you're hot-tempered, prejudiced and vain.
irascible. - Thank you, Sister Jacques.
sister Thérèse?
how do you value me?
above the others.
it's not about you. I'm vain, right?
you're outspoken, but ashamed.
full of self-Iove? - You want others to like you.
I'm edgy, messy, stubborn?
you're loyal, you're yourself.
sister Madeleine?
you think highly of yourself.
you don't understand people.
not Madeleine, Sister Madeleine.
coquettish, ambitious, stubborn.
that's not true!
why do you all say this?
we all feel the same.
the others could be mistaken, but not you!
I thought you knew me. I thought you loved me.
you had ready the words that hurt me most.
your anger is like town gossip!
we're in God's light here.
thoughts and actions have a higher meaning.
and you behave like ants!
you're unwon'thy.
thank you, Sister.
you're jealous. You're mean.
I know.
you show me my flaws, I believe you.
but there's only one voice that I shall obey.
no one can stop me.
...suffered at the hands of many, "even those whom she'd most helped in her days of prosperity."
among them was an old woman "who had received food and mercy from the Saint during a famine.
meeting her in the street, "that they had to cross on a plank because of the sludge, the miserable woman pushed her benefactress, who fell into the mud."
she was thus exposed to disgrace and mockery, "to which the Saint responded..."
what is it?
stop petting Blackie.
...happy to suffer such humiliation out of love for Jesus Christ, "who fills the hearts of the faithful with consolation..."
I proclaim Sister Anne-Marie for mistreating an animal.
for penance, she'll read the Litanies.
I did not yield the way to an older Sister on entering the Chapter.
proclamations for Marie-Josèhehe?
Yes, for petting an animal.
what?
in the workshop... - No explanations here.
for penance, this week she'll enter last for services.
I laughed and turned around in chapel.
any proclamations for Sister Colette?
I proclaim her for petting an animal.
she'll sweep the chapel.
I am guilty of interrupting a Sister.
proclamations for Sister Thomas?
for petting an animal.
cease your proclamations!
the Council doesn't understand your proclamations.
mother St John surely does.
explain! You can't proclaim Sisters for petting animals.
they pet the Devil! - That's nonsense.
it's true, that beast came to hurt us.
it's an innocent animal.
it's Beelzebub! He should be judged.
because of him, Sisters commit mortal sins.
they rightly hate him.
he steals, hates us all, is a burden.
but Mother St John likes him.
they pet him for her, kick him behind her back.
Beelzebub proudly walks around.
look in his eyes, see a path of lies and hypocrisy!
sister!
a bluebird used to come here, it brought joy and sincerity.
and a toad that made us feel compassionate.
mother St Johrs cat ate them.
I'd proclaim her if I could, for not opposing it.
leave. You'll learn your penance in the refectory.
I impose a public penance for the scandal she caused.
sister Anne-Marie will kiss all her Sisters' feet.
when the appointed time had come, "the Son of God, "after 30 years of silence, "went forth to sow the celestial seed "of His Divine message...
I demand the rule be enforced.
she knows if she refuses she may be sent away?
she does.
sister, do you refuse you penance?
continue reading.
when the appointed time had come, the Son of God, "after 30 years of silence...
where will I go?
your family is expecting you. - My family!
I gave up that world.
sending me back is unfair.
my dear child...
I loved the world I left.
you don't know how much I loved it.
I ripped it from my heart to come here.
it was horrible, but I did.
I'll never again find peace there.
you force me to return to what will only be unappiness.
I beg of you, keep me.
I'm sorry, Anne-Marie.
my God, I'm no longer Sister Anne-Marie.
God knows you have no better friend than me.
I've esteem for your character, but there's no advantage for the community if you stay.
I'm asking for a huge sacrifice, but consider it to be a sacrifice and not a penance.
farewell, Mother.
is it raining?
no, my umbrella ensures sunshine.
very wise.
our prison visits are always rainy.
Yes, this is the convent.
mother, it's Anne-Marie's family! She hasn't returned.
she said nothing? - No.
Hello?
Yes, Anne-Marie left that day.
she was well.
no, I'm not worried. She's like that.
I'll ask around. I'll call you back.
you're really not worried?
let's ask Sister Madeleine.
sister Madeleine!
Yes, Mother?
did Anne-Marie say where she'd go?
she didn't return to her family? I knew it!
she said nothing?
no, nothing.
let's not be late.
you're holding the saw wrong, Sister.
get closer, bend over it, unless you want to tire yourself.
did you grease the saw?
sister Marie-Josehe, your woodpile will collapse.
Yes, Reverend Mother.
why "Reverend Mother"?
why can't you do anything right today?
unlike you, since Sister Anne-Marie left!
you're overjoyed that she's gone!
what's she have to do with it?
I'll tell you: You drove her away!
I don't know why or how, but you did.
you hated her, you're glad she's gone! She was too good!
you set her against Mother St John.
you're such a hypocrite,
I feel like hitting you!
what's going on?
two Sisters chatter instead of working!
sister Therese, oversee them.
it's already done.
you've a full hall, Mother, 30 applicants.
anyone new? - One who's surprising.
each prison has a rebel.
it used to be 17-21. Remember Therese?
another wants to see you.
let's go.
I got a call about Therese.
a friend of hers was murdered.
shot. The police are looking for her.
she must know the motive.
she may be an accomplice.
I wouldn't be surprised if she did it.
no one here would be if she killed herself, too.
do you remember her? Remember the scene she caused?
I remember very well.
council meeting, at once!
mother Prioress is back from prison sooner than usual.
we can't take risks for someone trying to save herself.
in the here and now or the hereafter?
vocations are often bred of crime.
true, Mother.
we must not concern ourselves with her guilt, but with her redemption.
I have great doubt as to that.
Why? She's obedient and follows the rules.
if only they were all so easy...
I'm not afraid of scandal, as you well know.
we must reach a decision, her trial period is over.
we won't turn her in, or abandon her.
but after having had to expel a pure soul like Anne-Marie,
I can't be lenient in this doubtful case.
I could find a religious home to protect her and give her work.
do it fast.
someone's trespassing, there's a hole in the hedge.
someone stealing our peaches. - No.
sister Agnes, who once stole them, now checks them.
none missing.
anything odd in the convent?
not so far. - Any footprints?
I saw none... but you may.
I'm flattered to be promoted to detective.
our Founding Father's here, what could go wrong?
Yes, someone came through.
someone who didn't fear the nettles.
it's a small hole. Maybe a lamb...
I'll fill it up with thorns tonight.
you, in your sleepless slumber, whose eyes see all of us, thank you for receiving me each night!
the hole was full of thorns tonight.
the others think I am an intruder who comes to steal a little eternal peace, but I shall always be your Daughter.
when I leave my barn to come here, the path that brings me to you is as wide as the world.
you are not yet a Saint.
you wanted to share our misery for as long as possible as a simple human being, as our Brother.
that is why, before my prayers, I beseech you...
help me! My punishment was too severe.
and Therese...
Therese, who you entrusted to me...
allow me to hear her voice in this song, as I am no longer allowed to sing...
is she dead? - She's breathing.
but she's so cold.
sister Anne-Marie!
let's take her to the infirmary.
you won't kiss her?
Therese?
she's here, hush. You'll see her.
she came through the hedge. - Every night.
she's very sick.
what does the doctor say?
there's no hope. Her heart may give out any moment.
such fine news I hear!
did Mother Prioress tell you?
she says I'm dying. - Sister Anne-Marie!
convents panic. They give you Extreme Unction for a cold.
this will be my first Extreme Unction.
you must tell her. She can't go without knowing.
she doesn't want to know.
how strange not to sense death approaching.
it's horrible to have to tell her.
but I can try again...
don't forget my penance, Mother.
I must do it fast.
my Sisters' feet keep passing in a procession before me.
of course. When you're able.
see, you're granting me a respite.
don't be sad, Mother.
I assure you, God couldn't be so cruel...
as to give me such an important mission...
and only allow me to throw a cat into the hall.
he wouldn't allow it.
he knows what He's doing. We've only to wait.
I'm waiting, Mother.
well?
Therese won't leave yet.
Therese? - Anne-Marie's holding on for her.
that's why she thinks she can cheat death.
we can't separate them now, when their game is unfolding.
you hate me, don't you?
why would I?
because I treated you badly.
you had good intentions.
I behaved foolishly.
as if I could teach you, when, in fact, I knew nothing.
I was foolish.
no, you werert.
my only excuse is that I did it out of love for you.
I thought I knew you, but I didn't.
no harm, I'm not interesting.
you are.
you alone interest me.
I know that now.
I know why you're here. - I think not.
I made you lie to me, tell me you came because of me.
it was childish of me.
don't speak so much.
you came to hide.
from whom?
from whom or what isn't my concern.
something horrible happened to you when you got out.
you saw your world aflame, you saw a ghost...
you came here to hide. - Not true.
instead of abandoning life, you abandoned the world.
I should have helped you, but I didn't.
I made you into the Prodigal Child.
I dragged you into the light.
cried out your name to all, to God...
I was grotesque. - Sister!
I strutted proudly beside you...
you, who had been flayed alive.
I now see what you needed.
though it may be too late. - What did I need?
a silent presence, someone to stop your tears with silence, and your suffering by her presence.
simply a friend.
a friend... Why are you getting up?
because I'm leaving.
I don't want to be near you!
you're lying again!
you're trying something else on me!
prestige wasrt enough. Now friendship!
no, you don't understand.
there's one cure for my suffering: Indifference.
flayed, that's right.
you can't caress the flayed, or dress the flayed...
God, when can I be alone?
you are.
that's what hurts so much.
it's me, Therese.
I see you.
I'm not getting better, am I?
there must be a cure.
there is one cure. It'll work.
tell Mother Prioress.
our Mother can't help.
I'm dying because I failed to get what I wanted.
you're too ambitious.
maybe so.
you thought the world was pretty, that life had hope.
I still do.
I thought I'd heal a broken heart.
a broken heart can be healed, but not a dead one.
if I thought I could do it, I'd live.
it may take 100 years.
then I'd live 100 years.
you look better.
Yes. Maybe it's the first day of my 100 years.
is that you, Mother?
I was right the other day,
Therese is the killer.
Yes, I assure you.
the gunsmith...
the gunsmith who sold the gun recognized her photo.
sorry I had to tell them you had contact with her.
they'll have to come to the convent.
let go of my hand! - It helps me.
that's not why you hold it, you want to know what it did.
your hand is a question.
then answer it.
you pry into my eyes, watch my gestures!
even when you pretend to sleep, I know you listen to my steps.
you spy for Mother Prioress!
sister Therese! - Look at this face.
look at it well, and remember what you see. You'll never see it again!
I can't go on.
you know my secret now. Are you glad?
you held my hands to handcuff them.
go ahead! Turn me in!
if I speak of you, it won't be in this world.
no one in the convent will turn you in.
but you can't keep living a lie, or deceive our Mother.
I can't get up, Sister Therese.
please tell Mother Prioress.
I'm going.
beloved Sister, we entrust you to Almighty God, "who created you from the dust you return to."
now your soul shall leave your body.
shining angels are ready to greet you.
the Apostles shall judge you.
the triumphant, white army of martyrs is coming toward you.
the choir of virgins draws you into the blissful sleep of the patriarchs.
the Holy Mother of God...
Yes, I am ready.
I said goodbye to an old woman.
what did she say? Can she pronounce her vows?
she's delirious. We'll wait.
the Sister with birds!
you swim so fast, I can't keep up!
I feel so ill.
I feel so wonderful.
she's dying!
Yes, sing the Salve Regina.
the police. Tell Mother Prioress.
the police!
the police.
let them wait.
let them wait. I've waited, too.
mother Prioress will fix everything.
sister Anne-Marie, can you take your solemn vows?
Yes, Mother. But hurry...
the Book of Constitutions.
I, Sister Anne-Marie, profess to you...
I can't speak...
Therese...
I, Sister Anne-Marie, profess to you...
that I shall obey...
God, the Most Holy Virgin Mary, the Blessed Patriarch Dominic, and you, my Mother, according to our rule.
and I shall remain obedient until my death...
see you soon, Sister.

I spread the investments as wide as I could.
just the unfortunate state of the economy we all behind...
Hello? Mr Dean?

your candy taste like shit.
Hey, it's not your fault. - Whose fault is it then?
I never even met this guy.
I just move around some numbers.
now he's screwed.
well so everyone screwed, stop mopping.
maybe I should have taken today off.
and then you would've miss your chance.
what do you mean?
what? - Today is her last day.
she's quitting? - That's what I hear.
no. - Yeah.
don't be a bitch and go ask her out.
I tried that already.
I mean I said it myself.
right, because you can't say the word "date."
what did you call it again?
I asked her if she wants to meet up for a gathering.
gathering? What is she, a wizard? - I don't know why I said that.
did she carry a wand next to her purse?
it just came out. - That's rough.
if you didn't, I ask her myself. - Thanks bro.
welcome.
come on. Come on. I messing with you, go talk to her.
I can't - Why can't you?
because I left my balls at home.
no, not again. - Yeah.
left them right there on my dresser. - Right next to your night gal?
Yeah, right next to it.
in fact it's probably covered in little people to keep them warm.
that's good. Like a... a male penguin.
like a male penguin? - Yes.
I don't know what that means. - That's fine.
see you Monday. - What about the Christmas party?
Ah...

Yeah, nothing say good times like streamers.
and bitches. Streamers and bitches, that's what its all about.
that is life, Dave.
sometimes, its all about going home. - Well you said, you give me a ride.
that's crazy, Corey, because all those yellow cars out there with a signs on top, if you give them some money, they'll take you where ever you want to go.
get out of here. - Yeah. I swear.
that's cool, look the point is if you leave now, you're going to blow with her forever.
life's about choices man, one bad one can ruin every good one you've ever made.
you had to read that somewhere.
no, I don't read.
alright, I'm wondering. - That's what I'm talking about.
it's going to be a good night bro. I could feel it.
let me go and smoke the joint at the break room.
thank you.
alright, so I purposely ordered the pizza like 3 minutes before midnight...
on new years eve? - Yeah.
what everyone doing for new year this year?
who gives a shit. I'm telling my story.
it's going to be easter by the time you're up.
you know, ever since you grew facial hair, Jerry, you like a different person.
a different person that I don't like.
where was I?
you were talking about having pizza on new years eve...
right. So anyway 3 minutes passes, the ball drops facing the new year and behold 10 minutes later, there's a knock on the door, and it's the point of the story finally showing up.
good one. Another good one from Jerry. Just you got a word count today, Jerry.
so you got to get at a certain level and so it is.
it's a pizza guy and I said you'd better not be charging me for this thing.
I ordered the damn thing last year.
right.
did you end up paying him? - What? Luke.
the pizza, did you pay for it? - No, I heard you the first time.
I was saying what for emphasis.
I think you are naive to follow me along now. Alright.
anyway...
shit! - Come on, man.
what the hell? - I'm sorry.
I just get some napkins over here.
I'll just um... Luke, what's going on, man?
what? - I feel like you're not here.
Oh, hey, Emily. - Hi, David.

Oh, no, I'm good. I'm was just leaving.
Yes, I heard that.

Oh, no, Corey told me you got a job at MPO or something.
Oh, right. No, I did and then I was leaving the...
whatever.
well, Congratulations! - Thanks.
Yeah. - Thanks.
you need a change, I guess.
Yeah, I guess I go as far as I can handle and find it.
Yeah, I know how that is. - Yeah.

okay.
I'd better get going. - Well, good seeing you.
and you. Thanks for the drink, for the offer...
that I already have.

okay, bye. - Bye.
maybe I'll catch you later. That was pretty cool.
Emily.
Hey, you forgot your hat.
Oh, you have a... - Yeah, that's not mine.

well, consider this a going away present from whoever it is that owns it.
I'm really going not that far you know, my office is only like a few block up town
did you want to grab lunch sometime?
Oh...
Oh... It's cool I understand. - No, no, I would.
sorry.
I think I'm nervous. - Nervous? About what?
about this, about us talking.
Really? - Yeah.
well, we talk plenty of time before.
Yeah, at work, you called me at my desk and asked me if I had a balance sheet.
but that was a...
I never care about the balance sheets.
Really? - Yeah.

I'll just go with you right now.
I told you I'm going to give Emily a ride home.

it would take ten minutes.
you live like twenty minutes the other way.
you're not going to make me walk, right?
alright.
let's go. - Okay.
see you guys.
just going to make sure this isn't poisonous.
James, you might wanna close your legs, because I'm going to see your vagina.
Oh, it is? - Check it on my seat.
no? What about a... Check them at the table?
Yeah. Yeah, it's about right.
leave it on my desk.
just leave it on my desk, Jerry.
don't look at my photos. Hello?
he found it?
Jerry on drugs again, man.
for sure, remember when he was drinking cough syrup?
remember when we called him Little Wayne for like 8 months, because he was always getting drunk.
your battery dead, by the way. - Let me see it.
dude. - My bad.
I'm sorry by the way. - For what?
I realize we're going the other way.
no, it's fine.
I'm enjoying the company.
it's true, I am good company.
I'm starving.
I'm so hungry, you know what I'm saying?
that you hungry? Yeah, we heard you.
so why don't we this, what's good with getting food?
it's after midnight. - And what am I? A Gremlin?
Yes.
thanks... I appreciate that Emily in a big way.
dude, eat at home.
I don't have anything at home, and let just stop somewhere, it's not a big deal.
Corey, nothing's open.
what about that pizza spot?
it's open right now, it's right near here.
let's get a slice or two.
Yeah, but I kinda want to bring Emily home.
I want you to bring Emily home. I want to paraphrase with that,
I just want to eat something because I build blood sugar on dyslectic, and I just did if I eat, this third wheel, shenanigans would end right after.
dude, you're killing me right now.
I'm sorry about him. - Oh, it's fine.
that's cool, I need to stop by the ATM by the way.
just use your debit card.
okay, I can't use my debit card because they only take cash, unless you want to spot me.
alright. Where's the ATM?
alright, we're here.
no. This is what we're doing.
you need an ATM, right? - Yeah, I need a walk too.
are you punishing me? He's punishing me. Look out.
alright.
Emily. Do you need like a deposit slip or anything related to banking?
I'm good, Corey. - Okay.
what? - Nothing.
I'm sorry about him.
I'll make sure he's fast at the pizza place.
Oh, I don't mind.
they actually make pretty decent pizza.
they got a mushroom and garlic that's good that I had a few times with before.
they also have like a pepperoni, that's good.
I'm sorry I don't know why I'm telling you all this.
I thought I was the nervous one.
what are you talking about? I'm not nervous.
you're not? "I'll catch you later...
okay, that was... I was a little nervous then...
but I like it, it's cute.
what's that?
it's nothing.
Oh, yeah.
protect me, my passenger and all who pass by with a steady hand and watchful eyes
it's stupid, I don't know how I got it. Just...
it came with the cars. - It's nice, I like it.
there's nothing wrong with having a little faith,
I like it.
it back for you and your car.
what is it now?
you got to be kidding me.
I'll be right back. I'm sorry.
what's wrong - Nothing
I just don't want to wait in the car.
I will just be a second. - It wouldn't lock by the way.
Yeah. The clicker thing is broken.
why are you taking out money?
Corey's card is not working.
don't embarrass me in front of Holly.
I'm just saying. - I'm going to pay you back
my magnetic strip messed up. I'm freezing.
that make me feel warm.
all set. Let's go.
what?
who the hell is that?
who gives a shit. Let's go - Wait - For what? - Just wait.
why is he out there? Probably want to use the ATM.
why didn't he come in then? - Who cares, I'm freezing. Lets go.
wait. Just wait a second.
dude, he's waiting to use the ATM. There's no big deal.
Where's his card? - Probably in his wallet.
what if he want to rob us - He's not going to rob us.
Corey it's one in the morning
why else would this guy be standing there within an empty parking lot?
the same really we're here.
did he just walk here alone?
I don't see a car.
this is retarded. I'm going to leave.
what was that? - I don't know!
why did he do that?
maybe he thought we were done, so he thought he can finally come in.
should we call the police? - No.
I think we should.
look let me just ask him why he is here then
hey buddy!
do you want to use the ATM?
what does he want then?
probably our money...
does he have anything on him?
do you see? - I don't know, I can't tell.
are you guys being serious right now?
who cares about this jerk off, let's go!
says this guy who got scared back in the booth.
yeah whatever. If we all leave at once, we'll be fine.
he's just watching us.
maybe he's homeless. - Yeah probably is.
so give him food and let's get out of here.
he doesn't look homeless - What makes him not look homeless?
well you're that big.
all right go ahead.
what he's doing?
how it's going?
is there something I can help you with?
Oh my god! - Oh shit!
hey...
Oh my god - Did you see that?
shit! Call 911. Call them.
I don't have my phone.
where is your phone?
in my purse. - Where's your purse?
in the car - Shit!
don't this thing has a panic button or something?
I can't find it.
what about a hard line? - What do you mean?
I don't know, like an elevator phone or something that connect to...
right. Right.
there's must be something. Something we can do to get someone's attention.
who? There's no one else out there. There's a guy with the dog.
dude you saw what happened to him.
what doesn't he come in here?
I don't know maybe he doesn't have an ATM card.
why would that stopped him?
you need for the security buzzard right?
does the guy with the dog has one?
has he checked? - How the hell should I know.
no he hasn't. - We have to do something.
where are my keys?
here.
maybe I can get to the car. - You'll never make it.
you don't know that. - He's right there.
you never get within 10 feet of it. - We have to do something.
what's he doing?
he's going to my car.
Where's he going?
is he leaving? - No. I can't tell.
shit! He went around the back.
should we go? - I don't know
shit!
your phone, are you positive it's in your purse?
on the front seat? - Yes!
no. No. No - He's back there.
by the time he get around the booth I'll be half way to the car.
what about the other half way?
he has a gun.
no, he would've shot at us by now.
this glass probably bullet proof.
no it's not.
maybe Corey's right. We should just wait.
it will light up soon the parking lot will be full of people.
no. The sun won't be up for hours.
this is insane! - David.
it's too dangerous,
okay?
what?
what was that? What happen?
he cut the power.
there's no heat. He cut off the heat.
no ... No ... No!
shit!
he's back.

this thing is going to have an alarm on it.
Corey where is your lighter?
I don't have one.

it's driving away - They don't see us.
Oh god where is it going? - They don't see.
I'm so cold
Corey, how much money do you have in bank?
I don't know. Why?
you didn't think you giving that asshole money are you?
he just killed the guy Corey.
all right. If you take out 500 too maybe a thousand would be enough.
dude. My card is not working.
shit! That's right!
here. Take these.
okay!
wait if your card broken how did you get in here?
what do you mean?
if the magnetic strip in your card is messed up like you said then

what?
your card were fine right?
you just being too cheap to take out money.
right?
no... No...
No!
okay I'm gonna toss this to the side of him away from the door
if he goes for it, we run the other way before he made around - Yeah okay - No.
what? - What if there's more of them?
what do you mean? What?
him
what if he's not alone?
I'll go alone.
Oh boy, you're not going to strand us here.
I'm not stranding anybody!
if I make it to the car the I can go for help.
there's 500 dollars in here. Plus a watch and a pair of ear rings
it's yours all of it, okay?
please, just let us go.
we not going to tell anyone about this.
we never even seen your face
you can just take this and disappear like nothing happen. Okay?
its that okay?
I'm just going to toss this to you and it's yours.
Dave he's coming!
Hey! - No. David!
no. Leave him! - Go! Go!
come on. Come on!
are you alright? - He cut the wires.
Oh my god!
here.
are you okay? - Yeah, so do you.
what is he doing?
what is he doing?
shit!
help
wait. What's back there?
cement - Son-of-a-bitch
let me see your card.
I took out as much as I could. - I know - Here - What is it?
wait you're doing it backwards - I know
I know.
I remember hearing enter a pin backward, into the ATM it automatically alert police.
it's like a panic code.
in case you're getting rob.
that's bullshit, it's an urban legend.
how do you know that?
well what if you pin is like 4224, you're screwed.
it's still worth trying right?
where did he go?
did you see him leave?
I turned around he wasn't there anymore.
did you actually see him walk away? - Who cares?
this could be our only chance. Let's go.
what if he went out back?
even if he did we're less safer here then we are out there.
but we're still alive - He's not.
Corey.
please don't.
if he wants to get in here, he can.
he doesn't know that.
he can smash one of this windows with a rock.
or drive the damn car right at us.
then why hasn't he? - I don't know!
I don't know.
card HAS BEEN SECURED IN ATM VAULT
shit!
it took my card.
why is he doing this to us?
I don't know - Maybe we did something like...
like what?
what about that guy from work today?
what guy?
the guy that was screaming at you on the phone.
what did you do him? - Nothing.
bullshit nothing!
you lost half his 401K for 3 days before Christmas right?
yeah I know that. Corey, but this guy isn't him.
how do you know? - Because I know.
you said it yourself you never seen him in person
no I haven't.
but that guy was in his 60's.
if anything this guy could be one of the thousand of people you piss off everyday.
you lost his retirement plan?
Emily this guy isn't doing this because I lost his money. Okay?
if that were the case why did he kill some guy walking his dogs?
it doesn't make sense.
you think it's a reason?
Oh god.
this is all bullshit.
I guess you got it all figured out.
I can't feel my fingers. - Neither could I.
here give me your hand.
Corey.
here rub your hand like this.
Hey. - What?
who's that? - Oh shit, that's the cop.
it's the police.
it the same one from before.
okay, as soon as the cop sees us, we're going for it. Alright?
Yeah.
it's a security guard. - So what?
he can't do shit to stop this guy - Where is he? - I don't know.
call the police. - What?
call the police. - Are you okay in there?
watch out! He's out there.
Hey!
he is trying to kill us.
Oh, Jesus!
Emily, are you okay?
Emily?
leave me alone.
would you please just leave me alone.
she got to keep moving. - I know. I know.
we should make a run for it. - No.
come on, either one of us is going to get away.
who's going to play bait? You?
because I'm sure as hell not going back there again.
do you have any plans? - What?
plans?
I don't always thought there were plans.
she's disoriented as hell. - I know.
we can't stay much longer. - Yeah, no shit!
is he...?
what do we do now?
leave.
we have to call the police.
Yeah, we will.
let just get out of here first.
are you okay?
Hey!
are you okay?
what?
how does he...?
what did you do? - We didn't do anything.
he was going to kill us.
who is this? - I don't know
if that's him, who is this?
I don't know.
what are you doing? - I'm looking for his cell phone.
who is it?
Harold Wesburg.
8th Frederic st.
what is he doing here?
he was using the ATM.
no... No. We don't know shit about this guy.
for we know he could be helping that douche bag outside.
he got a wife and kids.
that could be bullshit.
he was a janitor. He was just going to work.
you had to make me stop. You couldn't just go home.
don't try to make this my fault. - It is your fault.
nobody makes you stop. - You did. You make me stop.
I didn't make you do anything. You could've said no.
I did say no twice, but as usual you don't give a shit.
don't make this my fault. I think it's your fault.
my fault? - How's this my fault?
get out of my face.
fuck you! - Stop it.
but you still don't have to do that, right?
stop it, stop it.
stop it.
you did it too, you kill him.
get off me. - You did it too.
he's gone again. - He's out there somewhere.
I'm tired of this thing. I'm tired of this.
I'm tired of this shit.
I'm tired. I'm tired of hiding.
I'm tired waiting for trouble to come save me.
it's the only option we have. - By you maybe.
what are you going to do? - I'm gonna get the hell out of here.
that is exactly what he wants you to do.
he's one guy and there's three of us.
I can't go out there.
don't.
are you leaving?
I didn't care anymore.
I don't care if you want to stay here and die. That's your choice.
but I'm done with this. I'm done.
Corey.
please don't go, Corey.
no.
I'm tired of waiting.
enough with the tough... Corey, get back here.
get back inside.
Corey.
No!
don't, David. David, you cannot leave me in here.
Corey, look out. Corey!
no. No, David.
no, it's too late. - Let me go.
please!
this can't be happening.
the hat.
I know it wasn't yours.
I grab it back off someone chair - Oh yeah? Why you?
I was desperate. - For what?
for a way keeping you from leaving.
yeah?
I wish I just let you go.
I'm sorry. - Don't be.
you should be at home right now - David.
this is all my fault.
it's all of our fault.
we've been here for hours now trying to control what happening to us, you know, waiting for a reason, and what?
because we didn't do anything wrong. We're somehow suppose to be protected?
by who?
the police?
alarms?
little of them visor clips with saint on them?
you still shouldn't be here.
I could have taken a cab.
I could have skipped the party.
I could have never worked at Starweather in the first place, but I did.
I did ... I did all of those things.
I did a million random things in between.
now that my life brought me here to be with you.
so...
so ...
although I was just thinking considering the circumstances that lunch might've been a better option.
Oh my god! - He's alive.
get him off.
let's headed for the big road. - Let's get him inside.
come on.
hurry.
just hanging there.
go.
get the door.
Corey.
come on.
Emily, what are you doing? I need your help.
come on, buddy.
watch me, Corey, come on. We gotta get him out.
cover it with something. - With what?
anything. - Give me something.
Emily, hurry. - Here.
what should I do? What should I do? - I don't know.
should I pull it out? - No... No. Don't pull it out.
that could make it worse. - It's not stopping.
okay.
good, good.
come on, buddy.
come on. Good.
Corey.
we have to get him to a hospital.
how? - I don't know
but if we don't, he's going to bleed to death.
I got some pressure on him. - Keep going like that.
where are you going? Corey? - Just hold him there.
What're you doing?
it will send a signal to the police if it was broken, won't it?
I don't know.
something in this thing has to insult somebody at the god damn bank.
we're locked in. - What's he doing? What's he doing?
grab him.
Emily, help me grab him.
come on, buddy, hang in there, hang in there.
come on. Look at me. Look at me.
you'll be alright.
Oh, shit!
come on, David, help me.
David, help me. David.
get him on the shelf.
prepare to lift him, are you ready?
1, 2,3.
come on. - I can't.
come on, higher. - I can't.
come on. Hey, buddy, make it there.
come on, lift him one more time. Okay?
okay, here we go. - 1, 2,3
higher, higher, higher.
we almost there. - I can't.
get him off the water.
bring him to the corner.
come on, we got to get him in the corner. Hanging there, buddy.
put him in the corner right there. Come on.
look at me.
he trying to drown us. - After minutes it will freeze us.
it's his cigarettes. - Is there a lighter?
there's one.
Corey, hanging there, buddy.
come on.
hold my legs.
stop it! You're not going to reach.
okay. Alright. Okay.
find something to burn - Corey, hanging there, buddy.
help me if you could find anything.
okay, it's good.
okay, now put it in. - Now hold it right there.
are you ready? - Bring me more.
you should get it hurry.
give it to me. Careful.
am I near it? I cannot see it. - No
it's still too far. Careful.
okay. Alright - Okay, hold it.
hold it right.
I've got you.
I can't see it.
damn it.
we got to find something.
David, come here. Help me out.
what aare you doing? - The fire is burning out.
well, we're wasting time.
pull me up on your shoulder, and I'll be able to reach it.
okay, pass it to me.
okay, okey, okey.
you got it? - I got it.
okay.
Yeah. Okay. There.
right there.
it works.
Emily.
Emily. Emily. No, look at me. Don't give away, okay?
don't give away. No.
hold on Emily. Hold on. No.
no. Look at me please.
get down on the ground.
he's right there. He's right there.
What're you doing? He's right there.
What're you doing? He will be right there. He's right there.
no. No. No.
please.
What're you doing? No.
he killed them. No, he killed them.
What're you doing? Listen to me please.
I didn't do anything. What're you doing to me?
please listen to me.
Mrs. Alsop's out!
Mrs. Alsop's out!
did you turn off the gas? - What gas?
which is her room? - Er, this one.
we must move her. Where's the landlady?
not home. - Where's your room?
two floors up.
take her shoulders, I'll take her feet.
come on, Miss.
pick up my bag.
sorry, you'll have to do that yourself.
open the windows. She needs lots of fresh air.
so do I.
shall I call an ambulance? - No time.
she needs an emetic first. Glass of water, please.
here it is.
I need 2 quarts of warm water and some towels.
towels, coming up.
you found this bottle clutched in her hand?
certainly did, from your dispensary.
I see. How long have you known this girl?
about five minutes.
she'll need looking after for a couple of days.
how about the ambulance? - It isn't necessary now.
she's out of danger.
besides, sending her to a hospital would start an inquiry.
and attempted suicide means jail.
however, in a couple of days she'll be fully recovered.
meanwhile, let her rest quietly.
if she's thirsty give her orange juice.
and tomorrow, if she has an appetite a little chicken broth, but no tinned food.
now, if you'll be at my dispensary in ten minutes
I'll have a prescription for you.
for me? - No. For her, of course.
headache?
where am I?
in my room. I live two floors above you.
what happened?
I came home this evening and smelled gas coming from your room so I broke in the door, called a doctor, and together we brought you here.
why didn't you let me die?
what's your hurry?
are you in pain?
that's all that matters. The rest is fantasy.
billions of years it's taken to evolve human consciousness and you want to wipe it out.
wipe out the miracle of all existence.
more important than anything in the whole universe!
what can the stars do?
nothing... but sit on their axis!
and the sun, shooting flames 280, 000 miles high...
so what?
wasting all its natural resources.
can the sun think? Is it conscious?
no, but you are!
pardon me, my mistake.
here you are, and there you go!
well, bless me. Heavens alive!
look at that. Look at me door!
house breaking, that's what it is!
I suppose she's taken her things. She'll go to jail for this.
I knew she was no good.
that quiet type.
still waters that run deep usually stink!
that's funny, she hasn't taken a thing.
and she won't, either.
not until she's paid 4 weeks rent.
smashing in a door!
nice festivities going on behind my back!
well, she's out now and she'll stay out!
Mr. Calvero! Oh Mr. Calvero!
is that you, Mr. Calvero?
your laundry. I was about to leave it on your bed.
just a moment!
hold it, hold it!
hold everything!
you dropped these.
and here's your oranges.
thank you.
so this is how she spends her evenings.
you take your hands off me!
what's she doing in your room?
the opposite of what you think.
I'd like to know who smashed in the door downstairs.
I did. - You did!
you have a leaking gas pipe.
I have a what?
I mean that room has a leaking gas pipe.
there's something fishy about this.
who is she anyway? - You ought to know by now.
came six weeks ago. Said she was a working girl.
that's what they all say. Why are you so interested?
the girl tried to kill herself.
took poison, turned on the gas. I came home just in time.
I'll call the police and get an ambulance.
it'll be in all the papers. You don't want that.
she's not staying where she is.
my good woman, I don't want her! Let her go back to her room.
I should say not. Besides, it's rented.
you can't throw her into the street!
she's not going back to her own room.
then she'll have to stay where she is.
what? And scandalize my household!
we could be man and wife for all anyone knows.
Oh, could you? Well, you'd better not be.
you'd better get rid of her, and quick.
man and wife!
you watch out for that hussy.
she's no good. And she's been sick since she came here.
it wouldn't be dandruff, would it?
ready?
I am an animal trainer
a circus entertainer
I train animals by the score Lions, tigers and wild boar
I've made and lost a fortune In my wild career
some say the cause was women Some say it was beer
then I went through bankruptcy And lost my whole menagerie
but I did not despair I got a bright idea
while searching through my underwear
a thought occurred to me
I'm tired of training elephants so why not train a flea
why should I hunt for animals and through the jungle roam
when there's local talent to be found right here at home
I found one but I won't say where
and educated him with care
and taught him all the facts of life
and then he found himself a wife
I give them board and lodging free
and every night they dine off me
they don't eat caviar or cake
but they enjoy a good rump steak
off my anatomy Off my anatomy
it is an odd sensation
when after meals they take a stroll around the old plantation
now I'm as happy as can be
I've taught them lots of tricks you see
and now they're both supporting me They're both supporting me
so walk up, walk up I've the greatest show on earth
walk up, walk up and get your money's worth
see Phyllis and Henry Those educated fleas
cavorting and sporting On the flying trapeze
so any time you itch Don't scratch or make a fuss
you never can tell you might destroy Some budding genius
Phyllis! Henry! Stop that!
what do you think you're doing?
you ought to be ashamed of yourselves, fighting like that!
alright. Phyllis, stay in the box! Henry!
you should have done that before I opened the box.
do you hear? Come on!
do you want me to squeeze?
stop that now!
come up from there!
Phyllis, you hear? Remember you're on a diet.
Phyllis, have you gone mad?
stop that, do you hear? Stop it!
Phyllis, do you hear? Come up at once! You go too far!
Phyllis, what are you doing?
crazy little creature!
Phyllis, Henry wants you.
come, Phyllis.
Phyllis, stop that.
Phyllis, come out here! Come out!
where do you think you're going? You nitwit!
Phyllis! Stop that now!
do you want me to scratch?
that's not Phyllis.
Where's Phyllis?
Oh, there she is!
are you awake?
your husband said to look in on you.
who? - Your husband.
he said to warm up some chicken soup for you.
husband?
let me help you. Come on.
you haven't eaten a thing all day.
a nice warm soup will do you good.
thank you, no.
your wife won't eat.
well, that's a blessing to a poor married man.
how do you feel?
much better, thank you.
good.
pay no attention to this wife business.
it's a front of respectability for the new housemaid.
however, as soon as you get well you'll be free and divorced.
I think I'm well enough now.
not quite. I think you'd better stay another day or so.
you're very kind.
I think I'm able to get back to my room now.
I'm afraid that isn't possible.
Why?
Mrs. Alsop's rented it. The people are moving in today.
Oh, I see.
however you're welcome to stay here until you know what you want to do.
what can I do? I'm helpless.
why didn't you let me die and get it over with!
that's no way to talk. You're alive and you better make the most of it.
I'm destitute. Ill.
listen...
I don't know what's wrong with you, but if you're ill, and if it's what Mrs. Alsop thinks, you should do something about it. It isn't hopeless.
if it's, uh...
you know what I'm talking about.
I don't think I do.
well, let me put it this way.
a young girl, alone, thrown into the world, gets ill.
if it's anything like that, you can be cured.
there's a new drug performing miracles, curing thousands.
if it's anything of that nature don't be afraid to tell, maybe I can help.
I'm an old sinner, nothing shocks me.
it's nothing like that.
are you sure?
positive.
but you have been ill?
Yes. I was five months in the hospital with rheumatic fever.
is that all? Then what are you complaining about?
it's ruined my health. I can't work.
what do you work at?
I was a dancer.
a dancer!
a member of the Empire ballet.
and I thought you were a...
so, you're a ballet dancer.
pardon me, we haven't met formally. What is your name?
thereza Ambrose. But I'm called Terry.
charming. How do you do. I'm also in the business.
my name is Calvero. Perhaps you've heard of me.
you're not the great comedian?
I was. However, we won't go into that.
whatever brought you to this state of affairs?
ill health, mostly.
then we'll have to get you well.
it isn't the ideal spot for convalescing, but you're welcome to it, if you can put up with being Mrs. Calvero. In name only!
it won't inconvenience you?
not at all. I've had five wives already.
one more or less makes no difference.
moreover, I've arrived at the age where platonic friendship can be sustained on the highest moral plane.
now let me see, your mother was a dressmaker and your father a lord?
the fourth son of a lord. That's quite different.
how is it he married your mother?
she was one of the family housemaids.
sounds like a novelette.
did he have any money? - No, the family cut him off.
so your sister's the only one living?
Yes, and she's in South America.
tell me, was it just ill health that made you do what you did?
that, and... - And what?
the utter futility of everything.
I see it even in flowers, hear it in music.
all life aimless, without meaning.
what do you want a meaning for?
life is a desire, not a meaning.
desire is the theme of all life!
it makes a rose want to be a rose, and want to grow like that.
and a rock want to contain itself and remain like that.
what are you smiling about?
your imitation of a rose and a rock.
I can imitate anything.
ever seen a Japanese tree? They're lopsided, they grow this way.
of course pansies grow this way.
the dark ones frown and go like that.
however, the meaning of anything is merely other words for the same thing.
after all, a rose is a rose. Not bad, should be quoted.
think how meaningless life was a moment ago.
now you have a temporary husband and a home.
here's your drinking water, and in case of any emergencies, the first door on the left, the same on each floor.
good night.
spring is here!
birds are calling
skunks are crawling
wagging their tails for love
spring is here!
whales are churning
worms are squirming
wagging their tails for love
what is this thing Of which I sing
that makes us all bewitched?
what is this thing That comes in Spring
that gives us all the itch?
Oh, it's love
it's love, It's love love love love
pardon me, but have you a fly swatter?
I beg your pardon.
if you beg around here, I'll call the police.
I repeat, I beg your pardon.
I don't care what you've eaten.
I've eaten nothing.
poor dear. Here, get a sandwich.
sir, I demand an apology! - I don't know you.
who are your people? Are you in the social register?
my name happens to be Smith. - Never heard of them.
that shows you're asinine.
I should have worn my overcoat.
you've interrupted me in the middle of my sonnet.
in the middle of your what?
not in the middle of my what, the middle of my sonnet.
my ode to a worm.
Oh worm, why do you turn into the earth from me?
tis Spring! Oh worm!
lift up your head whichever end that be and smile at the sun untwine your naked form and with your tail, fling!
high the dirt in ecstasy!
tis Spring! 'Tis Spring! 'Tis Spring!
ridiculous! A worm smiling at the sun!
why not? - A worm can't smile.
did you ever appeal to its sense of humor?
of course not. - Well then!
but it doesn't make sense.
why should poetry have to make sense?
don't you know there's such a thing as poetic license?
I've given you no license.
Oh no, don't!
this thing is so much bigger than ourselves!
at this moment I'm grasping the meaning of life.
what a waste of energy.
what is this urge that makes life go on and on?
you're right. What does it all mean?
where are we going?
you're going south. Your hand's in my pocket.
naughty.
how did it get there? - Pure magnetism, old dear.
why are you antagonistic towards me?
must we be serious?
you make it difficult to know you.
read my memoirs in the Police Gazette.
you're a funny man. - Why?
to talk about worms the way you do.
why not? Even flies are romantic.
flies? - Oh yes.
coming from the stable to the table, chasing each other over the sugar and meeting in the butter.
you've read "The Life of the Bee"? - No, I haven't.
the bee's behavior in the beehive is unbelievable.
Really?
Gezundheit! - It certainly does.
I beg your pardon? - The dress. It goes on tight.
you're awful dusty tonight, my dear. Turn around.
where do they keep you? On the top shelf or something?
fuller's earth? Johnson's powder? I know! Cornstarch.
just think! All life motivated by love.
how beautiful.
by no means beautiful. - It certainly is.
no, it's vile, wicked, awful! But wonderful.
I like you. - Really?
you're sensitive. You feel things.
don't encourage me.
it's true. So few people have the capacity to feel.
or the opportunity.
allow me.
use it only for what you wish.
come in.
good morning. How do you feel?
better, thank you. - Good.
what a day!
the sun's shining, the kettle's singing, and we've paid the rent.
there'll be an earthquake, I know it.
what would you like for breakfast?
we have eggs, bacon, cheese, spring onions...
that's broken my dream!
I dreamt we did an act together, all about Spring.
interesting.
I get lots of ideas in my dreams, then I wake up and forget them.
you know, I've been dreaming a lot about the theater lately.
doing my old acts all over again.
kippers. Aren't they superb!
what's wrong?
it's my legs! I tried to get up this morning and I collapsed.
I can't even stand.
you got up too soon.
no, it's not that. I have no feeling in them.
they're paralyzed. I know it!
don't upset yourself. After breakfast we'll call the doctor.
I'd better go to a hospital.
you know best, but see what the doctor says first.
I can't stay here, causing you all this trouble.
I'm not complaining.
you should, I'm such a bore.
but it's not my fault. You would save my life.
well, we all make mistakes!
I'm sorry.
you should be. A young girl like you wanting to throw your life away.
when you're my age, you'll want to hang on to it.
Why?
well, at this stage of the game life gets to be a habit.
a hopeless one.
then live without hope. Live for the moment.
there are still, there are still...
there are still wonderful moments.
but if you've lost your health!
my dear, I was given up for dead six months ago, but I fought back.
that's what you must do.
I'm tired of fighting.
because you're fighting yourself. You won't give yourself a chance.
but the fight for happiness is beautiful.
happiness...
there is such a thing. - Where?
listen, as a child I used to complain to my father about not having toys and he would say "this" is the greatest toy ever created.
here lies the secret of all happiness.
to hear you talk, no one would ever think you were a comedian.
I'm beginning to realize that. It's the reason I can't get a job.
Why?
because they have no imagination.
or think because I'm getting on in years I'm old, all washed up.
Never! After hearing you talk.
perhaps I drank too much.
there's usually a reason for drinking.
unhappiness, I suppose.
no, I'm used to that.
it was more complicated.
as a man gets on in years he wants to live deeply.
a feeling of sad dignity comes upon him, and that's fatal for a comic.
it affected my work.
I lost contact with the audience, couldn't warm up to them.
and that's what started me drinking.
I had to have it before I went on.
it got so I couldn't be funny without it. The more I drank...
it became a vicious circle.
what happened?
a heart attack. I almost died.
and you're still drinking?
occasionally, if I think of things.
the wrong things I suppose, as you do.
what would you like for your breakfast?
what a sad business, being funny.
very sad if they won't laugh.
but it's a thrill when they do.
to look out there and see them all laughing, to hear that roar go up, waves of laughter coming at you.
let's talk of something more cheerful.
besides I want to forget the public.
never. You love them too much.
maybe I love them, but I don't admire them.
I think you do.
as individuals, yes. There's greatness in everyone.
but as a crowd, they're like a monster without a head that never knows which way it's going to turn.
it can be prodded in any direction.
I keep forgetting about breakfast. How about some poached eggs?
come in.
a telegram. - Oh, thank you.
are you all right?
this is what I've been waiting for.
good news?
redfern, my agent, wants to see me.
wonderful!
you're right. This is the turning point.
those managers have been holding out on me, breaking my morale.
but now they want me!
and now I'll make them pay! For their contempt and indifference.
no, I'll be gracious.
that'll be more dignified, put them in their place.
I'm to be at Redfern's office at three.
I'll call the doctor and tell him about your legs.
but I forgot your breakfast!
how about some nice kippers?
nothing for you, or you, or you...
nothing for you.
anyone waiting? - Miss Parker.
anyone else?
Yes, Calvero. He's been here since three.
I forgot all about him. Show him in.
good afternoon, Calvero. Sit down.
sorry about yesterday. I was held up over some important business.
however, I've good news for you.
I can get you a week at Middlesex Music Hall.
at what terms?
I don't know yet, but I wouldn't bother about that.
no bother at all.
however, if money's no object, - what billing am I to get? - I wouldn't bother about that either.
I'm not to get star billing at Middlesex?
I'm not sure we can book you there.
you think I'd allow those managers to throw in my name with a lot of nondescripts just to build up their reputation!
calvero's still a name to conjure with!
you're mistaken. Today it means nothing.
then why do they want me?
they don't want you. They're doing me a favor.
very kind of them. I hope you appreciate the fact.
I'm going to be perfectly frank with you.
I've been talking Calvero to them for over six months.
your name is poison. They don't want to touch you.
they couldn't if they tried.
I'm sorry, but you must be made to realize the facts.
you're succeeding splendidly.
I'm trying to help, that's all. But you must cooperate.
whatever you say, I'll do.
that's the spirit.
as soon as the contract's confirmed, I'll let you know.
however, cheer up.
if my name is poison to them, I won't use it.
I'll go by another name. - I think that's a splendid idea.
well doctor, how is our patient?
the condition is cleared up, but I find nothing wrong with her legs.
didn't she tell you she's had rheumatic fever?
Yes, but I don't think she has.
the heart would have been affected and it's perfectly sound.
I believe it's a case of psycho-anesthesia.
what's that?
a form of hysteria that has the characteristics of paralysis without being so.
how do you account for it?
in her case, I'd say it's psychological, self-imposed.
having failed at suicide, she's decided to become a cripple.
is there any way I can help?
primarily she must help herself. It's a case for a psychologist.
doctor Freud.
well, I'll see what I can do.
good day, Doctor. - Good day.
tell me more about your sister Louise.
there's nothing more to tell.
when she couldn't find work she was driven to the street.
how old were you when you discovered this?
about eight.
tell me about it.
it was after my mother died. I loved Louise.
she was everything to me, supported me, had me taught dancing.
then one day I realized what she was doing.
I was coming home from dancing with the other girls and I saw her, and the other girls saw her, walking the street.
what did you do?
I just ran and wept.
ran and wept.
then what happened?
I tried to forget.
I was sent to boarding school. At 16, I left and joined the Empire Ballet.
Louise went to South America. I haven't heard from her since.
up to that time, you had no trouble with your legs?
no.
when did it start?
about two years later. After Melise joined the ballet.
who's Melise?
one of the girls from the dancing school.
one who was with you when you found out about Louise?
Mr. Freud would say that since meeting this girl again, you don't want to dance.
Why?
you've associated it with the unhappy life of your sister who paid for your lessons through a life of shame.
you've been ashamed to dance ever since.
I'd despise myself if I thought that.
that's the trouble, you do.
that's the trouble with the world. We all despise ourselves.
Streetwalking!
we're all grubbing for a living, the best of us.
all a part of the human crusade, written in water.
but enough of that.
ever been in love?
no, not really.
I think it was more a feeling of pity.
the plot thickens. Tell me about it.
it's a ridiculous story. I hardly knew the man.
it was something I built up in my own mind.
it was after I came out of the hospital.
I took a job at Sardou's stationary shop.
he was one of the customers, a young American.
he used to buy music paper in large and small amounts, according to his finances.
he seemed so lonely, so helpless and shy.
there was something pathetic about him.
I wouldn't have noticed him, but someone tried to elbow in.
when I ignored the other man, he smiled in gratitude.
the old charwoman who worked where he lived told me he was Mr. Neville, a composer, and that he occupied the top room.
there were days I knew he went without food to buy music paper.
I could see it in his eyes.
the haggard look.
sometimes I'd throw in a few extra sheets.
once I gave him more than his proper change, which he might have noticed, but I wasn't sure.
often after work I'd stroll by his house and hear him playing piano, repeating musical passages over and over again.
and I'd stand listening, excited and melancholy.
well, what then?
then for weeks I never saw him.
the charwoman told me he was ill. Creditors had taken his piano.
eventually he came into the shop looking very pale and asked for two shillings worth of large orchestral sheets, placing a two shilling piece on the counter.
I knew it was his last.
if I could only help him! If I only dared!
I could lend him money. I wanted to tell him so.
but I was also shy.
nevertheless I was determined to help.
I gave him some extra sheets and as he was about leave
I called him back:
you've forgotten your change.
there must be a mistake, he said.
not at all, I answered.
you gave me half a crown, here's sixpence change.
then I realized I had created a ridiculous situation.
to make matters worse in came Mr. Sardou:
can I be of any assistance?
it isn't necessary, I said quickly.
the gentleman gave me half a crown and forgot his change.
however, Mr. Sardou made him take it.
but as soon as he left Mr. Sardou went through the till and finding no half crown there, became suspicious.
the discrepancy was discovered and I was discharged.
what did you do then?
I tried to get back to dancing, then I collapsed with rheumatic fever.
did you ever see this young composer again?
Yes, five months later. After I came out of the hospital.
I saw him from the gallery of the Albert Hall.
his symphony was played there. It was a great success.
of course you're in love with him.
I don't even know him.
you will. Life is a local affair.
I can see it happening.
you'll be at the height of your success and he'll call on you, and tell you he met you at some super party.
won't I recognize him?
Oh no. He's grown a beard. Musicians do.
he'll tell you he's composed a ballet for you.
and you'll realize who he is, you'll tell him who you are and how you met, and how you waited on him.
and gave him extra music sheets.
and that night you'll dine together on a balcony overlooking the Thames.
it'll be summer.
and you'll be wearing pink mousseline.
and he'll be conscious of its fragrance.
and all London will be dreamy and beautiful.
and in the elegant melancholy of twilight, as the candles flutter and make your eyes dance, he will tell you he loves you.
and you will tell him you have always loved him.
where am I?
Yes, life can be wonderful if you're not afraid of it.
all it needs is courage, imagination and a little dough.
now what's the matter?
I'll never dance again! I'm a cripple.
pure hysteria! It's in your mind. - It isn't true.
otherwise you'd fight! - What is there to fight for?
Ah, you see? You admit it.
what is there to fight for? Everything!
life itself! Isn't that enough?
to be lived, suffered, enjoyed! What is there to fight for?
life is a beautiful, magnificent thing.
even to a jellyfish.
what is there to fight for? You have your art, your dancing!
but I can't dance without legs!
I know a man without arms who can play a scherzo on a violin and does it all with his toes.
the trouble is you won't fight. You've given in.
continually dwelling on sickness and death!
but, there's something just as inevitable as death and that's life. Life, life, life!
think of the power that's in the universe!
moving the earth, growing the trees!
and that's the same power within you.
if you'd only have courage and the will to use it.
good night!
faster, faster. Come on, dance!
beautiful.
I fooled you that time. Come on.
take that away. Come on!
what's the news?
europe in a race for armaments.
anything interesting?
a write-up about Mr. And Mrs. Zanzig, the mind readers.
I played with them years ago.
they say they can transfer thoughts to each other.
nonsense!
then how is it done?
not transference. I was with him once when he sent his wife a telegram.
more coffee?
just a half cup.
I'm sorry, I didn't intend...
Oh no, it's good exercise.
look at you, hopping around like a two year-old.
I think there's an improvement.
definitely.
but I get so nervous doing nothing. - Nothing?
I welcome every new hole in your socks.
housework and cooking, what more do you want?
keep fighting, that's all.
that reminds me, Mrs. Alsop's on the warpath again.
she wants to know how long I'm going to stay.
tell her to mind her own business! We pay our rent.
Oh no, there's a month owing.
since they postponed the Middlesex opening, it's upset everything.
don't worry. I can handle the old girl.
all she needs is a little pinch and a pat.
don't you think I should go to a hospital?
I do not.
you'd have one problem off your hands.
after the Middlesex, our problems are over.
you know, preaching and moralizing to you has really affected me.
I'm beginning to believe it myself.
I haven't taken a drink since I've known you.
wonderful.
and I'm not going to, even on opening night.
you don't need it.
you're excruciatingly funny without it.
Oh, yes.
what's that? - Maybe a letter from Redfern.
just the man I want to see!
how thrilling!
this is no joke. When are you getting rid of that girl upstairs?
don't be jealous. - Jealous!
what have you done to your hair?
where are your spit curls?
never mind all that! You owe me four weeks' rent.
have I denied the fact? - You'd better not.
Sybil, you really want to hurt me, don't you? You little minx.
behave yourself!
I get so full of nonsense when I'm around you.
you fool!
what about that girl upstairs?
now, now. Be patient.
you'd better get rid of her this week.
bear with me. I know it's been a trial for both of us.
both of us! Who are you kidding?
you!
you wonderful little plum pudding, you!
but we must behave ourselves.
that takes care of the rent.
was there any post? - No. That was for Mrs. Alsop.
Oh for the life of a sardine That is the life for me
cavorting and spawning every morning
under the deep blue sea
to have no fear of a fisherman's net Oh what fun to be gay and all wet
Oh for the life of a sardine That is the life for me
funny thing,
I dreamt I was a sardine.
I dreamt it was lunchtime, and I was, uh...
swimming along, looking for a little bit of bait and I found myself passing a large bed of kelp.
and there on it, I mean in it, was the prettiest little fin you've ever seen.
that's what we call them in the fish world: Fins.
the way she maneuvered her tail, with such finesse.
she seemed to be in trouble.
all right old boy, let's all go home.
Yeah, you're right. Good night.
I beg your pardon.
Blasted! These shoes are too tight.
good night.
what are you doing up so late?
I just couldn't sleep.
then I saw the partition doors open, so I got up an hour ago.
some hot soup?
no, thanks.
you look tired.
do I?
I know you're worried, but the Middlesex contract's signed, it's just the delay.
there's no delay.
what do you mean?
it happened tonight.
the Middlesex?
why didn't you let me know?
I didn't want you to go through the suspense of it.
then forget everything now, and get a good night's rest.
they walked out on me.
they haven't done that since I was a beginner.
the cycle's complete.
but you've changed your name! They didn't know you.
no, I wasn't funny. The trouble is, I was sober.
I should have been drunk before going on.
I still insist they didn't know you.
just as well they didn't.
naturally! You can't expect too much the first performance.
you haven't worked in a long time.
but you'll see, tonight when you go back it'll be different.
I'm not going back.
Why?
they've terminated the contract.
but they can't do that!
they can. They have.
you were engaged for the week! You can insist.
it's no use. I'm finished.
through!
nonsense.
are you, Calvero, going to allow one performance to destroy you?
of course not! You're too great an artist.
now's the time to show them what you're made of. Time to fight!
remember what you told me, standing there by that window?
remember what you said?
about the power of the universe moving the earth?
growing the trees, and that power being within you?
now is the time to use that power, and to fight!
Calvero, look! I'm walking!
I'm walking!
I'm walking!
just think, I can walk!
well, I can't any further. I have to quit right here.
do you realize it's almost five o'clock?
I know. But I couldn't stay in that room another minute.
I don't blame you.
cheer up.
look, the dawn is breaking.
that's a good omen.
I know it. It will be.
it must be.
don't be discouraged. You'll get on your feet again.
on my what again?
but think how fortunate we are!
at least we both have our health.
now I can get a job. There's always chorus work to keep us going.
us?
Yes.
us.
you and me. Together.
Mr. Bodalink! - What is it?
the front office, sir. - Thank you.
Terry, I was about to leave you a note about Calvero.
have him see me tomorrow morning before your audition.
he's all set for the part. - Wonderful!
just a minute.
why, Terry! I didn't hear you come in.
how could you?
allow me. My friends,
Mademoiselle Thereza.
how do you do.
we're just having a little beer, Bach and Beethoven.
isn't it rather late for music?
not if we play a nocturne.
proceed with the butchery, only make it soft, sentimental, largo.
I'll stick to beer if you don't mind. - Coming up!
but what will Mrs. Alsop say?
a fine thing! After climbing up three flights of stairs,
I've just discovered I've got nothing but a lot of empty beer bottles.
why, Terry, is the show out?
I didn't realize it was that late.
it's very late.
that's our cue, we'd better go.
you're not going! We were just about to celebrate.
but it's almost one o'clock. - So what?
wait a minute!
Calvero gave me three horses and I doubled up on them!
now that only happens once in a lifetime.
wait a minute. Those stairs are steep. I'll lead the way.
that's all right, I can handle myself. Don't you worry about me.
good night.
I'm sorry, my dear. I'm drunk.
it's your health I'm worried about. You know what the doctor said.
Yes, I shouldn't drink. It's bad for the heart.
what about the mind?
I suppose that should be clear and alert so I can contemplate the future.
the prospects of joining those gray-haired nymphs that sleep on the Thames embankment at night.
you'll never join them while I'm alive.
Oh, I forgot to get your supper! I'm no good.
I'll get it later on. First I'm going to put you to bed.
but you've had nothing to eat.
did you take your medicine?
what medicine?
you didn't. It's to give you an appetite.
I've quenched my appetite.
you'll be ill again, if you don't eat.
well, I much prefer to drink.
a man's true character comes out when he's drunk.
me, I'm funnier.
too bad I didn't drink at the Middlesex.
I've got good news for you.
Mr. Bodalink wants to see you tomorrow morning.
who's he?
our dance director. He wants you to play a clown in the new ballet.
I'm through clowning.
life isn't a gag anymore. I can't see the joke.
from now on, I'm a retired humorist.
you'll feel differently in the morning.
no, I hate the theatre!
someday I'll buy an acre of ground somewhere and raise a few cut flowers, and make a living that way.
what do you think? It's all settled. I play the clown.
let's sit down over here and you can tell me all about it.
of course, the salary isn't much.
two pounds?
but it's a foot in the door. Naturally I'm not using my own name.
this Bodalink's a nice chap. Says you're quite a dancer.
if you'd have come to the theatre, you might have known it.
why didn't you tell me you were auditioning?
I wanted to surprise you.
I'm not sure of the outcome. It depends on Mr. Postant.
Postant! I thought he'd retired years ago.
why, do you know him?
last time I worked for Postant, I was the headline here.
Footlights!
your hands are quite cold.
I think I've got the girl. Young, sympathetic, a brilliant dancer.
bring her on!
Thereza, please!
you understand it's purely improvising.
that's how I always judge a dancer.
this is Thereza, Mr. Postant.
you'll be dancing to Mr. Neville's music. Listen to it first.
this is Mr. Neville, our composer.
how do you do. - How do you do.
I believe we've met before.
Really?
it's 12: 30, we'd better call lunch. Lunch everybody! Back at 1: 30.
allow me to congratulate the next prima ballerina.
you're sopping wet, my dear. Get your coat.
put in on and then we'll talk business.
allow me.
may I also congratulate you? - Thank you.
come dear. We'll meet at my office at 2: 30 and fix up her contract.
but we're rehearsing at 2.
make it 6, after rehearsal.
run up to your dressing room before you get a chill.
Where's Neville? - Coming!
all right Frank, turn off those lights.
here I am.
I was looking for you outside.
what are you doing sitting in the dark?
I'd be ridiculous in the light. Look at me, I'm shameless.
but I can't help it.
my dear, you are a true artist.
true artist.
this is absurd. Ridiculous.
I've waited for this moment.
I love you.
I've wanted to say it for so long.
ever since the day you thought I was a woman of the street.
you took me in, cared for me, saved my life, inspired it.
but above all that, I just love you.
please, Calvero, marry me.
what nonsense is this? - It isn't nonsense.
my dear, I'm an old man.
I don't care what you are.
I love you. That's all that matters.
latest news, express!
while you're having lunch, I'm going to see about my wig.
then I'll go with you.
you'd better have lunch first. I might be delayed.
I'll see you back at the theatre.
have a good lunch.
Oh, hello there.
I'm the man at the piano who played a moment ago.
it's quite crowded.
always is at lunch time.
two?
very well.
your order, please.
bacon and eggs, toast and tea.
the same.
that's always safe.
beautiful day to be rehearsing.
although the papers are predicting more rain.
Really?
what's the joke?
I finally have the chance to talk to you and I've nothing to say.
what is more eloquent than silence?
I'd better change tables. - I won't bite.
I'm not too sure. I was severely frostbitten a moment ago.
what do you mean?
this morning. When we were introduced.
I don't understand.
my reception was rather cool, I thought.
I still don't understand.
I'm sorry.
I seem to be getting a little involved.
you see, I had an idea that we'd met before.
well, perhaps we have.
if we haven't, then you have a twin sister.
who is she?
do you really want to know?
Yes.
a young girl who used to work at Sardou's, a stationary shop where I bought music paper.
a very shy, reticent girl.
she seldom spoke.
but her smile was warm and appealing.
I read many things into it.
I also was shy. It was a bond between us.
she used to give me extra music sheets, and occasionally extra change.
which, frankly, I accepted. Hunger has no conscience.
the day after my symphony played the Albert Hall,
I went back to the shop, but she'd gone. They said she'd left months ago.
you haven't seen her since?
well, have I?
Yes, you have.
I know.
I lost my job giving you those extra music sheets.
you won't hold that against me? - Of course not.
I was very young then.
you're very young now.
I don't know. Soon I shall be an old married lady.
then I wish you lots of happiness.
thank you.
I wish that waitress would hurry.
before we do the choreography, I'll explain the story.
it's about Harlequinade.
Terry is Columbine. She is dying in a London garret.
Harlequin, who is the lover, and the clowns, are at her bedside.
she asks to be carried to the window.
she wants to look upon the rooftops one last time.
the clowns weep. She smiles.
their clothes are not for sorrow but for laughter.
she wants them to perform, do their tricks.
the clowns can do their comedy.
while she's dying? - Yes.
let me see, where am I?
as the clowns perform, she becomes delirious.
spirits of Columbines dance before her.
then she dies. That's the first scene.
next is the graveyard where Columbine was buried.
Harlequin, her lover, enters in the moonlight.
he tries to resurrect her from the grave.
but he fails.
the spirits tell him not to grieve.
his love is not in the grave, but everywhere.
then Terry appears.
that's your solo, then the finale.
we'd better get a move on. It's only 3 weeks to the opening.
Calvero!
what is it?
how's it going? - Wonderful. Thumbs up.
I wish the dance was over. - You've nothing to worry about.
I'm scared. Pray for me.
God helps those who help themselves. Good luck.
I can't go on! - What?
my legs! I can't move!
it's nerves. Just move.
no, I can't move. I'm paralyzed!
pure hysteria! There's your cue, get on stage!
no, I'm falling! It's my legs, they're paralyzed!
get on that stage!
see? There's nothing wrong with your legs.
whoever you are, whatever it is, just keep her going, that's all.
I've lost a button.
one of these.
it's all right.
Where's Calvero? He told me to wait for him here.
I'll send the call boy to look for him.
supper is served. You're sitting next to Mr. Postant.
supper is now being served in both lounges.
come along, my dear. You're next to me.
Bodalink, you're down there my dear fellow.
destiny must be a headwaitress.
Why?
she seats us together again.
she might be your nemesis.
I think I'll stand up under the punishment.
however, my congratulations. Tonight you were wonderful.
that's what they call the old army game.
Neville, they tell me the army's caught up with you.
you've joined the army?
on the contrary, the army joined me. I was drafted.
that's awful!
I agree. It's carrying the war too far.
however, there's the possibility of joining up here.
would you like to dance?
I appeal to your patriotism. You can't refuse a soldier.
governor, I remember when you played Widow Twankey at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham, in 1890...
go easy there laddie, go easy.
let's have a drink.
Calvero, old boy, how's the world treating you?
rather aggressively at the moment.
you don't know me.
the fact is most gratifying.
is that supposed to be funny?
my man, you will never know. Have a little drink.
only have it at the other end of the bar.
pardon me, Miss Thereza is waiting for you in the dress circle.
what is it?
miss Thereza is waiting for you in the dress circle.
will you kindly tell her not to worry, I've gone home to bed.
very well, sir.
what's happened to Calvero?
he left word that he was tired and had gone home to rest.
I must go at once. Say good night to Mr. Postant for me.
I'll get you a cab.
I'll walk home.
he must be asleep, poor dear. Too much excitement for him.
I'm beginning to feel the strain myself.
then I'll be going.
shall we see you before you leave for camp?
I leave this morning.
good bye, Terry.
no, don't!
say you love me, just a little.
please!
I've tried to fight it, but I can't.
please, it's useless.
you're as helpless as I am. We love each other.
I never said I loved you.
every look, gesture says it!
no, don't say that!
I know how devoted you are to Calvero, but marrying him isn't right. It isn't fair to you.
you're young, just beginning life.
this devotion is idealistic. Your youth!
but it isn't love.
no, you're wrong. I really love him.
you pity him.
it's more than pity.
it's something I've lived with, grown to.
it's his soul, his sweetness, his sadness...
nothing will ever separate me from that.
good night, Terry.
good bye.
listen to this one:
with ease, Thereza pirouetted and flexed radiant authority.
she was light, quicksilver, efflorescing!
a Diana spinning wisps of beauty about her.
very good.
well, you've done it.
how's it feel to wake up famous?
that's right, have a good cry and enjoy it. It only happens once.
let's marry, soon.
if we could only get away. That house in the country, where we could have peace and happiness.
happiness.
the first time I've ever heard you mention that word.
I'm always happy with you. - Are you?
of course. I love you.
wasted on an old man.
love is never wasted.
Terry, you're like a nun, shutting everything else out for my sake.
it isn't fair, wasting your youth.
you deserve more than this.
let me go away.
what's come over you?
I can't help it! If I only had the strength to leave!
but I stay on, tormenting myself.
the whole thing is false.
in the few years I have left, I must have truth.
that's all I have left.
truth.
that's all I want.
and if possible, a little dignity.
if you leave me, I'll kill myself.
I hate life! The torment, the cruelty of it.
I couldn't go on without you! Don't you understand, I love you!
you want to love me. - But I do, I do!
it's Neville you love. I don't blame you.
that isn't true.
he's the composer you knew at Sardou's.
Yes. I didn't tell you because I thought it...
inevitable. I prophesized it, remember?
a balcony overlooking the Thames!
but it isn't true!
in the twilight he will tell you he loves you.
and you will tell him you've always loved him.
but I don't love him! I never did.
it was his music, his art.
he meant a world that had been denied me.
you look so well together.
but I don't love him! I never did.
please, you must believe me! You must!
dancing's excellent, but the comedy's poor.
we'll have to get rid of that clown.
I've called Blackmore's Agency, they're sending down another man.
you know who that clown is?
I don't care if it's Calvero himself. He isn't funny.
but that's who it is. - What?
Calvero, only he's under another name.
why the devil didn't you tell me?
he didn't want it known.
poor old Calvero. Well, that's different, we'd better keep him.
after all, the comedy isn't too important.
but I didn't see him at the supper party on opening night.
he didn't show up. That's why Thereza left so early.
what's he got to do with her?
believe it or not, she's going to marry him.
that old reprobate?
bless my soul, there's hope for me yet.
it's time for rehearsal.
wait a minute.
I'll call Blackmore's and cancel that fellow before he gets down here.
if you finish rehearsing early, don't wait for me.
I've so many things to do, but I'll be home by six.
Calvero? - Griffin!
I haven't seen you in ages! Where are you working?
nowhere. I'm looking for a job.
Blackmore sent me down to see this new ballet.
the Harlequinade?
I understand the clown's not very good and I could get the part. Wish me luck.
good luck, old man. - Thanks.
Mrs. Alsop!
what is it?
what on earth is the matter?
Calvero, where is he? Have you seen him?
what do you mean? - He's left me!
he's gone!
would you like to contribute?
captain, would you like to contribute?
no, that's all right, put it in.
I've no false pride.
sit down, have a drink.
thank you, old man, not during office hours. But I'll sit down.
may I?
how are you?
never felt better in my life!
and how is the army treating you?
not so bad.
I get up to London every other week.
have you seen Terry?
how is she?
after you left she was quite ill.
but she's all right now?
she's been touring the continent. Since she got back she's much better.
good.
she never told me what happened between you.
what could happen, but the inevitable?
you see a great deal of her?
good.
somehow I knew it would work out that way.
time is the great author.
it always writes the perfect ending.
great Scott!
how do you do, Mr. Postant?
just a moment. You're just the man I want to see.
would you like to contribute?
are you with that outfit outside?
I am, sir.
Oh, thank you.
you oughtn't to be doing this!
why not? All the world's a stage.
and this one is the most legitimate.
I must go, or my confreres will think I've run off with the takings.
thank you, gentlemen.
don't you think I should tell Terry I've seen you?
knowing I'm doing this sort of thing might upset her.
although I don't mind it.
there's something about working the streets I like.
it's the tramp in me, I suppose.
wait a minute. Why don't you come and see me at my office?
what about? - Business.
I never discuss business, I leave that to my agent. Call him up.
however I'm booked up solid, you know.
au revoir, Gentlemen.
driver, stop! Please, turn around.
keep the change.
Cyrano de Bergerac, without the nose.
let's sit down.
so they told you, huh?
I've been searching all over London for you.
the same Terry.
am I?
a little more grown up, that's all.
I don't want to grow up.
none of us do.
but I had to, after you left.
it's all for the best. All for the best.
perhaps.
I don't know.
but something's gone.
gone forever.
nothing's gone, it only changes.
I still love you.
of course you do.
you always will.
Calvero, come back.
you've got to come back!
I can't. I must go forward.
that's progress.
then let me go with you.
I'll do everything in the world to make you happy.
that's what hurts. I know you will.
Mr. Postant said he'd give you a benefit.
I don't want his charity.
it isn't charity.
he says it'd be the greatest event in theatrical history.
I'm not interested in events.
but I would like a chance just to show them I'm not through yet.
of course.
I've still got ideas, you know.
I've been working on, working on... a comedy act, for myself and my friend.
it's sort of a musical satire.
wonderful!
you know he's a very good pianist, and me with the violin...
a lot of very really really very funny business.
come in.
sit down, my dear. You look tired.
I've been working with the claque, going over Calvero's jokes.
I gave them cue sheets so they'll know exactly where to laugh.
are the jokes as bad as all that?
I'm worried. If he fails tonight, it'll kill him. I know it.
he won't fail. The audience will be most sympathetic.
but he doesn't want sympathy. He keeps saying that.
he wants to be a genuine success.
what does he expect? You know he's not the man he was.
he mustn't be told that!
tell me, my dear, are you still going to marry him?
I'll do anything in the world to make him happy.
he's a very lucky man.
he's a very, very lucky man.
I never thought we'd come to this.
here we have the star dressing room without a dresser.
Oh well, I guess we can put up with it for one night.
Fred, the stage manager.
come in, Fred.
like old times, seeing you in this room again.
what's on your mind?
you've got 10 minutes, because there's 20 other acts to follow.
you're in a song first, finishing up with a musical act.
I'll ring down after you fall in the drum.
no, after I'm carried off in the drum.
right you are. Thank you, sir.
if anybody else says it's like old times, I'll jump out the window!
first the doorman, then the call boy, now the stage manager.
it's me, Postant.
it's like old times seeing you here again putting on your war paint.
I'll be down watching the other acts.
Yes, like old times. Only in those days you were drunk.
I'm supposed to be funnier when I'm drunk.
maybe, but you were killing yourself.
you know, anything for a laugh. How's the house?
packed. Every face card in Europe is out there:
kings, queens, jacks...
is Neville out there? - Yes. Came up specially.
and what a program!
take a look at that. Every star in the business is appearing.
it'll be something, following all this talent.
don't worry. Tonight you'll make them look like amateurs.
that's all any of us are. Amateurs.
we don't live long enough to be anything else.
well, as one old amateur to another...
good luck. - Thank you, Mr. Postant.
come in.
how do I look?
funny.
I know what you're thinking, my health and all that.
but I had to take a drink.
there's a creamy white light turning off and on in my stomach.
and that's not so good, if I'm to be a success tonight.
is it really worth it?
not that I care for success, but I don't want another failure.
whatever happens, there's always that little home in the country.
this is my home. Here.
I thought you hated the theatre.
I do. I also hate the sight of blood but it's in my veins.
come in.
Mr. Calvero, on stage please!
good luck, sir. They're all waiting for you.
Thanks.
I don't like it.
everyone's so kind to me.
makes me feel isolated.
even you make me feel isolated.
why do you say that?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Oh, your change. - No, no.
of course!
all right, turn it off up there!
your change is all ready.
good luck, my darling.
aren't you going to watch? - I can't.
but remember I love you.
Really?
always. With all my heart.
ready, Mr. Calvero?
good luck, my darling.
let her go!
I'm an animal trainer A circus entertainer
I've trained animals by the score Lions, tigers and wild boar
that's not Phyllis!
Where's Phyllis?
there she is!
when I was three My nurse told me
about reincarnation
and ever since I've been convinced
thrilled with anticipation
that when I leave this earth
it makes my heart feel warm
to know that I'll return
in some other form
but I don't want to be a tree
sticking in the ground
I'd sooner be a flea
I don't want to be a flower
waiting by the hour
hoping for a pollen to alight on me
so when I cease to be
I want to go back I want to go back to the sea
Oh for the life of a sardine That is the life for me
cavorting and spawning every morning
under the deep blue sea
to have no fear for storm or gale Oh to chase the tail of a whale
Oh for the life of a sardine
that is the life for me
you're 3 minutes over!
it's the audience.
bow and finish.
I've another act to do.
bow and finish!
what am I to do?
just finish. There are 15 other acts to follow.
look, I've got Postant on the telephone!
please, please. Will you give me a chance?
what's wrong? Why isn't he doing an encore?
I can't keep the other acts waiting. They're complaining.
that's your problem. He does an encore.
do your encore!
Mmm, you darling!
here, take this. - What is it?
I have a terrific pain in my back and chest.
Dr. Blake is in the house. Shall I get him?
Yes, get him at once!
what's wrong? - He's hurt his spine.
did you send for the doctor? - Yes.
then carry him to his dressing room.
I'll tell the audience there's been an accident.
no, don't do that! Carry me on.
I'll talk to them. You'll ruin the evening.
on behalf of my partner, and myself...
this is a wonderful evening.
I'd like to continue, but I'm stuck.
take off his makeup.
is there a couch in his dressing room?
no, but there's one in the prop room.
take him in there.
everyone else must wait outside.
Where's Calvero? Where is the old scoundrel?
I want to congratulate him. Where's Calvero?
in the prop room. He's had an accident.
here's the doctor now.
I want an ambulance at once.
is it serious, Doctor?
very. It isn't his back, it's a heart attack.
is he in pain? - Not now. I've given him something.
I'm afraid he won't last the night.
what have they been telling you?
are you all right?
of course.
I'm an old weed.
the more I'm cut down, the more I spring up again.
did you hear them?
I don't mean the claque.
wonderful!
that's how it used to be.
that's how it's going to be from now on.
we're going to tour the world.
I've got ideas.
you doing ballet, and me comedy.
and in the elegant melancholy of twilight, he will tell you he loves you.
it doesn't matter. It's you I love.
the heart and the mind... what an enigma.
miss Thereza, you're on, please.
I won't be long, my darling.
I believe I'm dying, Doctor.
but then, I don't know. I've died so many times.
are you in pain?
no more.
where is she?
I want to see her dance.
wait a minute.
bring the couch into the wings.
I must see about that ambulance.
did you see what's happening?
come on, come on, let's go!
Hey, what's going on?
in there. It's on the news.
then, 18 minutes later, a second one went into the other twin tower:
can you paint us a picture of the situation in New York...
an everyday morning situation, presumably pretty busy in the streets, people going about their business.
well, it's a beautiful day here in New York.
everyone is out in the street, everyone's on their rooftops, everyone's on their mobile phones
I don't think people can quite believe what's happened.
given that this is the financial district, is it your understanding that people...
you're American, aren't you? Sorry, mate.
may actually be inside the World Trade Center?
I mean, without a shadow of a doubt there will be people in there. They get to work very early.
and what about the emergency services?
I, John Patrick Ryan, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, so help me, God.
come on, then! - I got one!
let's hear it! - Richmond Webb.
you serious?
my man was a seven - time Pro Bowler.
I'm just saying Brown's better.
man, how come every cat from Baltimore always got to bring up Orlando Brown?
because Brown's the most underrated offensive tackle in the business.
have you ever seen him play?
Yes, this is Lieutenant Ryan.
Yes, sir, I did. I was wondering if you had a chance to forward my report on the Saabir Khan Bridge to anyone in intel.
Yes, sir, they are the same findings I already reported.
I just can't help noticing a correlation between traffic patterns there and the region's other...
well, if they do respond,
I would be happy to explain it to whoever's in charge of regional...
sir?
still no love from the C. O?
I don't get it. I'm just trying to help.
Hey, guys. Buckle up in the back.
we're running into a little turbulence.
you all right there, Private?
sir, yes, sir! - Good man!
man, I still don't get why you requested this detail.
big brain like yours, man, why aren't you behind some desk somewhere?
you requested this?
I just figured if I was gonna serve, I should serve.
man, that's some patriotic shit right there, you see that?
you're all right, Lieutenant. Even if your team is wack.
Oh, stop talking trash on my Ravens, homeboy.
I'm a Bengals fan.
the Bengals?
rookie, get that harness on and stop trying to be down.
man, you got a lot to learn, Davies.
left in, right twist, click.
thank you, sir!
you want some help?
chopper crash. Spinal cord should be okay, but he's got two shattered vertebrae and no feeling in his legs.
lieutenant Ryan!
lieutenant Ryan! Did anyone else make it out alive?
Yeah, two. Ryan dragged them both out.
with a broken back?
okay, we're gonna have a look at you and it's gonna hurt, okay?
x - rays are on the board.
okay, turn him!
okay, clear him!
down on three. One, two, three.
can't do anything from here.
evac him to NATO trauma in Kandahar right now.
get an ear out to Dr. Hardesty.
tell him to prep for a foraminotomy or possible spondylolisthesis.
we've got spinal compression and root damage at minimum.
lieutenant has about a 90 - minute window if he wants to walk again.
let's go. Come on, come on!
out of the way! Out of the way!
that guy's done in this war.
gently.
push more to the next level.
good.
that's really good, Jack.
come on. You can do this.
get up.
I don't like you very much, Doctor.
I'm not a doctor. I'm a 3rd - year med student who is four credits short in P. T. until you decide to walk.
you're sick. You're a sadist.
come on, meet me halfway.
give me two Percocet.
get up and I'll ask them for one.
how long's he been here? - Eight months.
think he'll ever walk without the crutches?
maybe. If he decides he has somewhere to go.
I'd like to talk to him.
sure.
not yet.
but soon.
will you do me a favor and wait two minutes before you take that?
Why?
so that you know you can.
lieutenant Ryan? - Yes, sir?
please, at ease. Commander Thomas Harper, U. S. Navy.
why the uniform today?
I beg your pardon?
I mean, you were wearing a suit and tie the last time you were here.
you watched me from behind the glass in rehab.
what can I do for you, Commander?
you've already done it.
I just want to say thank you for your service.
I appreciate that.
John P. Ryan, right?
that's right.
the one who wrote Liquidity Events in Post - Soviet Markets?
two - thirds of it, yes. My... My dissertation.
the same John P. Ryan who filed three separate reports on traffic patterns in and around the Saabir Khan Bridge?
Yes, sir.
it's impressive work.
how did you get a hold of that, sir?
I'm in the CIA.
Jack?
so, this is... This is good - bye.
I'm glad I found you.
no more P. T. work for you?
no, just eye - doctoring.
Congratulations.
I'm hungry. You wanna buy me dinner?
you know I can't. - All right, you win. I'll buy.
I'll make you a deal. The day you run all the way out of here, we'll have dinner.
and split the check.
see ya.
see ya.
good luck.
Jesus, you weren't kidding. You are in the CIA.
somebody has to be.
why didn't you finish your Ph. D?
I joined the Marines. - And saved two of your men.
you handled yourself like a hero.
if you still want to serve your country, there's another way.
you're not really in the CIA, are you?
what are you?
Treasury? Foreign Asset Control?
you know, I'm not supposed to tell anybody what I do for a living.
and now, look, I've just told you twice.
what do you want from me?
I want to send you back to school to finish your doctorate.
then you'll join Financial Intelligence as an analyst.
you'll work in a series of private banks on Wall Street, where you'll use your position to uncover funding for terror groups.
covertly.
Yep. So you have to keep it to yourself.
your employers won't know you work for us.
the people you love won't know you do, either.
it's gonna get lonely, but it's how we like to do things.
you know, people don't like you guys very much these days.
waterboarding. Rendition.
not my unit.
come on. You can do better than that. - I can.
and I do. And so do the people in my unit.
which unit is that?
the one that makes sure we don't get hit again.
I knew. I knew when you saw me ride it, you'd want one.
nice.
Oh, her name's Sarah, by the way. - Who?
the one you like in Arbitrage.
how'd you know that?
why else would anybody buy a motorcycle?
Teddy Hefferman? - Sarah, yes.
Jack Ryan said you could help me with the Balfour arbitrage.
How're you doing?
what do you have?
this looks good.
the World Bank urging caution as volatilities in emerging markets continue to remind investors that with unprecedented global interconnectivity, even the strongest economies are vulnerable to collapse.
this just in. Last minute negotiations are expected today as the security council of the United Nations votes.
russia 's bitterly opposed to a new Turkish pipeline, which could see Russian economic dominance of oil exports shattered.
the big question, will the U. S. defy Russia?
the only thing that the Turks and the Georgians would undermine with their pipeline is Russia's monopoly on the Eastern European natural gas market. We both know that.
if you block our proposal and the pipeline is approved, oil falls below $79 a barrel and the Russian government goes bankrupt.
in our judgment, your assessment is extreme Thank you.
our request comes from my country's highest level.
and it is respectfully denied from mine.
then we will regard this as an act of economic war.
while Wall Street talks up the robust performance of the dollar many commentators look to the U. N.
and the bitter standoff between the United States and Russia.
the U. S - has the upper hand for now,
harper will want you. Just get yourself to Moscow.
our Russian partners are hiding accounts from us for the Russian economy of America's U. N. veto.
tell him he will need somebody in Moscow.
he'll want you. - No, I'm just an analyst.
our Russian partners are hiding accounts from us.
it's all in the data.
nobody else understands the data.
harper will want you. Just get yourself to Moscow.
Hello?
Jack?
you home yet?
I bet you looked cute.
overseas, where we see a surprisingly sturdy performance by the dollar;
holding its ground in spite of the Turkish pipeline vote at the U. N.
and the latest deficit news. Anika, your reaction ?
well, surprised, pleased certainly but this is extremely unusual behavior by the market.
commodities should be moving in the opposite direction of the dollar:
you'd see a very different direction by investors as well.
they usually waver from one day to the next...
is work okay?
Yeah. Yeah, it was good. Sorry about that. Yeah.
so, you feel like a movie this weekend?
sure.
there's a revival of Sony Wrong Number at the Film Forum.
I was thinking that might be fun.
Yeah.
have you ever seen it?
you know what I haven't seen is the waiter for, like, 10 minutes. Have you seen him?
no.
okay. So, should we go?
sounds good. - Good.
Yeah. Let's do it.
for you, sir? - Ah. Yeah, the lady will try it.
Yes, I will try it. Thank you.
sorokin wants to meet you now.
ten minutes.
Yes, Minister.
I warned them of the outcome at the U. N...
it was entirely predictable.
it was a mistake for us to force a vote.
you started moving assets when the vote went against us, I hope?
Yes, Minister.
you understand the Kremlin must remain entirely distanced.
anything you activate must be self - contained.
is it the hour for 'Lamentations'?
Lamentations?
the Russian government is unaware of any such activity or operation.
but of course.
you want to go to Moscow?
I think we have to.
they're unnamed, uncategorized, scattered all over the world.
they're hidden accounts, Rob.
these are just the ones I managed to find.
how did you find them?
you pay me to look. - Not to look that hard.
joke.
you think they're ripping us off? - I don't know what to think.
Jesus H. Christ.
you're the compliance officer. It's your call, but can I ask one thing?
don't screw up the most lucrative partnership this company has.
please? I'm not kidding.
Viktor Cherevin is completely unpredictable.
and it's Russia.
insider trading is legal over there. It's the Wild West.
they're still ideologues, but the new ideology is money.
they're not a country, they're a corporation.
which is why we're there in the first place.
I know, don't rock the boat. - It's not a boat.
it's a goddamn luxury yacht and we're all on it together.
so, don't fucking sink us.
why don't you want me to come? - you'd be bored out of your mind.
it's Moscow. How would I be bored?
I'll be working the whole time.
what about Paris?
what about Paris? - Well, it isn't boring.
and you won't be working.
they owe me a long weekend. You can meet me there when you're done.
what do I have to do to take a vacation with you?
you can marry me and call it a honeymoon.
why didn't you tell me about the movie?
what?
sony Wrong Number. You'd already seen it. There was a stub in your pocket.
you went through my pockets.
I folded your pants because you throw them on the floor and what I asked you...
why won't you just marry me, Cathy?
are you having an affair?
Oh, God, no. No. Is that what this is? Is that what you think?
who did you see the movie with? - By myself.
I'm a compliance officer. I do everything by myself!
it was a 1: 45 show.
I couldn't stare at the goddamn computer screen any more.
you know what? If the job isn't right for you, Jack, maybe it's time to move on!
Paris.
you and me.
okay?
Dr. Ryan. Embee Deng.
private security for Cherevin Group.
I'm your protective detail.
I need a bodyguard?
think of me as your fancy driver.
where are you from, Embee? - Uganda.
Cherevin only hires foreigners for security.
that way they know we're not FSB.
good afternoon, good afternoon.
this way, Mr. Deng.
wow, St. Basil's Cathedral. Beautiful.
it looks like ice cream. Ice cream top.
the Kremlin.
Yes, yes.
Ah, you speak some Russian.
you go and register. I'll help you upstairs with the bags.
no. That's okay. I can get it from here. - I'm supposed to check the room.
okay.
welcome, Mr. Ryan.
just your signature, please. - All right.
Mr. Cherevin hopes the room will be to your satisfaction.
Ah, yes. And the view is second to none.
Wow.
it's magnificent!
this is Cornerback. I have a situation.
you have 85 seconds.
I need help. - Category?
somebody tried to kill me. There's a body. - Are you intact?
close enough.
location?
Cornerback?

go quiet until 21: 30 local and surface at location Gamma.
contact bench at the base of the stairs.
I don't remember where that is.
confirm.
I heard you, I just don't remember the address, okay?
I'm just an analyst. I only did three weeks at the Farm.
you are breaking protocol, Cornerback.
I'm out of my goddamn element is what I am. I just need the address.
go back to your room and stay there until the phone rings twice.
then leave quickly and quietly.
keep out of sight until 9: 30 local time.
then, go to Staraya Square, the steps.
your contact will be on the bench.
Cornerback?
Yeah.
you're a Marine. It's the reason you're still alive right now.
remember your tradecraft and you'll be fine.
thank you.
time 's up.
Hey, I was just about to call you.
Hey. Yeah, I only landed a couple hours ago, so...
Oh, good. I'm not trying to hassle you, I just...
I just wanted to make sure the trip was okay.
Yeah. Yeah, it was, you know, uneventful.
well, that's the best kind.
so, what are you doing now?
I just left the hotel. Gonna... Got to go meet a colleague.
anybody interesting?
I don't think you know him. What are you up to?
well, I was just on call for a 48, but Saidelman says that he can cover me for the weekend.
so I thought, if I got on a plane tonight, I could be in Paris in the morning.
you think you could get away early?
Hello?
Yeah, you know, I...
I don't think so, Cath.
I think I'm gonna be tied up longer than I thought.
I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to make it there at all.
well, it sounds like you're having fun.
look, sweetheart, I'm...
I'm late and I'm tired. I'm pretty jetlagged.
can I give you a call in the morning, my time?
okay.
I love you desperately. You know that, don't you?
Yep.
don't lose faith in me.
okay.
you okay?
sit down.
you got to pick somebody to trust, Jack. Now, sit down.
you brought your dog?
Q. P. dog.
quasi - Personal. Why else am I out for a walk?
grabbed it out of somebody's yard.
they'll be thrilled when he turns up in the morning.
it's better they're shaking afterwards than during.
first person I ever killed, Jack, was innocent.
what did he do? - She.
she didn't do anything. She was a bystander.
somebody who just...
just came up behind me too quick.
Jesus.
how do you get over something like that?
if you're lucky, you get past it.
that's not the same thing. - No, it isn't.
now talk me through your very scary memo, but keep in mind I don't have your Ph. D.
two weeks ago, I noticed a series of accounts in our Russian partner's records to which our company's computers are denied access.
massive currency accounts, all in U. S. Treasuries.
Cherevin's made a total commitment to U. S. dollars when there's been a hurricane in the Gulfand a string of negative economic reports.
what does it mean?
it's external sterilized intervention.
like I'm an idiot, please?
the dollar should be going down, but it's up.
a few cents every day, the past week.
I think they're propping us up.
Why?
I think there's a coordinated plot within Russia to collapse the dollar and crash the U. S. economy.
and it's going to happen soon.
it'll be timed to follow a terrorist attack on U. S. soil.
no, that'd be crazy. The Russians would lose as much as anybody in a collapse.
no. No, no, no, the Chinese will lose more.
and once the Russians start to sell, the rest of the world is gonna dump every dollar they have.
all right, let's say it's happened.
let's say you're right. What's the aftermath?
they'll recover.
we won't. We don't have their oil reserves.
we're looking at the Panic of 1837, the Panic of 1893, the Soviet Famine of 1932.
hyperinflation - Bread lines. Rioting. - I know, I get it.
and at first, though, they'll call it the American crisis, but within about six weeks, they're gonna start calling it what it is.
the Second Great Depression.
the attack and the sell - off have to be timed to each other.
a massive series of transactions like that have to be programmed in advance and stored in Cherevin's system.
once I start the audit, I can get the date and time of the attack down to the minute.
you stick to the scheduled audit tomorrow.
everything official, everything in public.
you'll be fine.
I need for you to be fine.
your room should be clean by now.
we'll put a watch on it.
I drowned him.
in about that much water.
you know, you sold this as an office job.
you're not just an analyst any more.
you're operational now.
we will avenge our mother Russia.
you will avenge our family.
america will bleed.
good luck, Aleksandr.
everyone is in place, sir, in America and in Moscow.
let it begin.
Hi. Jack Ryan to see Mr. Cherevin.
one moment, please. - Dr. Ryan? I'm Katya,
Mr. Cherevin's assistant. He's expecting you.
I may be here a few days. Will I get my own card?
as a foreign guest, you'll need to be accompanied.
you understand?
of course.
Viktor Cherevin.
Jack Ryan.
how was your flight? - Fine, thank you.
and the jet lag?
that first night can be brutal.
I survived.
that's a nice painting. Napoleon at war.
so, you know your history.
what can I do for you?
routine audit.
so routine it couldn't be done from New York?
not when you're concealing accounts from us.
you Americans like to think of yourselves as direct.
but I wonder if perhaps you are just rude.
you Russians think of yourselves as poets, but perhaps you're just touchy.
nothing here is concealed. Only secured.
excuse me.
I hope I can count on full access to your account files?
you won't need it.
I ordered the companies which concerned you, quite unnecessarily, I might add, to be sold, at a profit.
your firm's percentages are detailed in this report. The funds were transferred this morning, too late, alas, to stop you from getting on your flight.
so, you see, an audit would be quite without purpose at this point, Mr. Ryan.
I See..
partnerships are delicate, Mr. Ryan.
sometimes, they end violently.
Dimitri Lemkov, our head of security.
Jack Ryan.
I'm sorry you had to come all this way for nothing, Mr. Ryan.
I hear the finest restaurant in Moscow is across the street.
in honor of our partnership and to, quite frankly, apologize for my mistake, perhaps I could take you to dinner.
no.
but I'll take you.
and I insist my driver pick you up from your hotel.
moscow can be very dangerous.
our own man, for example, who collected you from the airport. Embee.
we are very concerned. He has simply disappeared.
I'm sorry to hear that.
no doubt he will turn up in a day or two, hung - over and remorseful.
will your wife be joining us tonight?
I'm not married.
I was just told that she had arrived at your hotel.
my girlfriend.
even better, and our little secret.
you're having fun with me.
not nearly enough. Bring her along tonight. We won't go othenwise.
I'll be sure to ask.
a pleasure to have met you both.
he's dangerous.
I lost him.
you're done already?
he's outplayed us. - You didn't get anything?
nothing. Not one thing.
he sold all the assets.
he probably moved them to other shell companies.
but I can't audit what they technically don't own.
all right. We still need the algorithm.
Yeah. I invited him to dinner.
the restaurant is across the street from his building.
what if we...
what if What?
I don't know. - What, Jack?
well, what if we...
you wanna break into their system? - Yeah, I think someone should.
you think we can? - Yeah... I don't know.
put it up, the restaurant.
the orders to sell the dollar would be encrypted on the computer of the security director.
Dimitri Lemkov?
former FSB.
we can't break into his office. It's secured six different ways.
so, what about the office next to his?
well, that's Cherevin's.
can we get into that?
maybe someone could if they had his access card.
we're developing a security guard, but we don't have him yet.
well, develop harder.
he drinks, right?
like a Russian.
also chases women. The more married, the better.
okay, tell your guy once he's in there, he needs to enable all encrypted financial sell order packages.
tell him to look for dark pool algorithms.
and if your guy, if the guy...
I'm the guy, aren't I?
Yeah. You're going to be great.
but you've got another problem, Jack.
so I dropped everything, and I called in every favor that I knew and I spent four hours at the consulate begging for a visa.
you know, I wanted to make this grand gesture.
I wanted you to see what you meant to me. So, I'm here.
and you have to say something.
well, maybe it's... Maybe it's awful or hurtful or shameful.
I don't know. But you have to talk to me.
you can't let me think that I'm crazy any more.
because now I know that I'm not.
just talk to me.
will you meet me halfway?
I'm in the CIA.
thank God.
I thought you were having an affair.
is everything in place?
Yes, Mr. Cherevin, our asset in the U. S. has been contacted.
he's prepared?
Yes, sir. Merely awaiting your order.
we will strike... tomorrow.
very well, sir. Sell orders have all been entered.
it's time.
we will activate our asset immediately.
and this must be Aleksandr.
the prodigal returns.
he may not be a regular churchgoer, but he's a good man, my son.
he just turned 21.
and he already has a job at the auto plant.
it was stupid to mention the job.
a real mother would.
it wasn't necessary.
today's reading is from the Book Of Lamentations...
chapter 2, verse 2...
lamentations.
we've been activated.
thank God.
he has torn down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah.
he has brought her kingdom...
and its princes down to the ground in dishonor.
the timing of the attack has been brought forward.
Hey.
take nothing with you.
there is one loose end to tie up first.
playing the hottest music in Detroit. Feel the heat now.
excuse me.
you look kind of lost.
so, I'll have to keep him busy at the table for what?
ten minutes? To be on the safe side?
what are you talking about? You're not going.
you said he insisted I come to dinner.
it'll look suspicious if I don't show up. - No, no, it won't.
she's right, Jack.
to him, something will be off. - You're not involving her in this.
you involved me in this by not telling me.
you got to get her out of here. Send her home.
well, what are you gonna tell Cherevin? That I'm homesick?
these are dangerous people, Cathy. You cannot be here.
if you'd told me who you really were, I wouldn't be.
I took an oath!
I took an oath.
I couldn't tell you unless we were married. And you wouldn't marry me!
that's why you wanted to marry me, - so that you could tell somebody that you were in the CIA? - No, of course not.
you lied to me for three years and you were good at it.
I think you actually enjoyed it.
can we have a minute, please?
no, you can't.
I would like to talk to Jack alone.
this is geopolitics, it's not couples therapy.
do I really have to remind you what's at stake here, Jack?
there's a very real scenario here where we don't get out of this alive.
any of us. And neither do a lot of innocent people back home.
now, we had about eight minutes to discuss this little...
this little development. We just used four of them.
we don't need you to break into Lemkov's computer, just into the office next to his.
you plug this into any 220 outlet that shares the same wall with him.
we use the building's own electrical wiring to access Lemkov's hard drive.
how much time will he need to run the program?
five, six minutes, including movement.
so the answer to your question, yes.
10 minutes at the table ought to do it.
all right.
you know, we catch a few breaks, we can all be headed home on a plane by midnight.
Cherevin will be at dinner in... 55 minutes.
then I should get dressed.
I like her.
if Cherevin touches her, I'll kill him.
it's just dinner, Jack.
the most he can do is look.
and to be honest, we need him to.
good morning. - Morning.
do you know what happened three years ago today?
you agreed to stop wearing cargo shorts?
I did. I did, it broke my heart.
all that storage capacity. Incredible.
incredible shorts. No, but once I did agree to make pants a part of the new me, you finally agreed to go out with me.
well, I couldn't very well date a patient, could I?
could you marry one?
cause I'm in love with you, Doctor.
Oh, my God.
I'd appreciate it if you would wear the ring in public.
I left it in the hotel room.
I know.
I found it.
he's expecting to meet my fiancee. And this is his driver. So please don't embarrass me.
Ah, the Ryans.
perfect American couple. Welcome.
Viktor Cherevin, my fiance, Dr. Muller.
Dr. Muller, you are so beautiful.
Lemkov's headed out.
Jack, it's show time.
I hope you will enjoy the Haut - Brion.
it's a very special wine.
you find it amusing.
Jack had an early start. - So it seems.
Hey. Can I get another one of these?
this is good, Viktor.
Jack has a back injury.
from Afghanistan.
me, too.
different time, different empire, same graveyard.
my son's, also. - Sorry to hear that.
mujahideen grenade fragment is lodged in my hip to this day.
I wouldn't think a hand grenade would be the first thing you'd wanna keep on your desk.
a reminder of a vanquished rival.
you lost the war. - But I beat your grenade.
my grenade?
one supplied by your CIA.
perhaps.
perhaps.
well, I'm no medical doctor like my illustrious fiancee here, but I would recommend a Percocet or three for that hip.
with a nice, hearty red like this, you won't know your own name in an hour.
what? Come on, don't give me that look, Cathy.
I'm not gonna be policed at the dinner table.
do you want one?
I think not. - Are you sure?
Oh, I'm sure.
you are so attractive like this.
chin - chin.
will you excuse me, please?
Jack, I speak no Russian.
is it too much to ask to be escorted?
Oh, it's just the bathroom, Cathy. It's just the bathroom.
please. Allow me. - Thank you.
nice work, Jack.
I'm sorry.
I got it.
okay.
exit.
snowball is rolling.
okay to go.
step it up.
Viktor!
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor. Tell me.
which would you rather? Pick one.
either you live in some miserable shithole, you have no money, but you're single.
or you're rich, you live in some fantastic apartment, but you have to be, good God, you have to be in a relationship.
what do you think?
I'll leave the night to the two of you. - I won't allow it.
I think one of us needs to take a walk.
I think you should consider her suggestion.
please, sit down.
he's in.
you flew all the way to Moscow to surprise him or to catch him, which was it?
that's a rather personal question.
would you prefer impersonal?
I'd rather talk than make chit - chat, wouldn't you?
if we're going to be married, I'd like to know that I can trust him.
trust.
truth.
I think it's like most opinions, best unexpressed.
you talk like Pechorin.
you've read A Hero Of Our Time?
I had a misspent sophomore year.
Really?
I love Lermontov. That Russian romanticism is so achingly desperate.
desperate, yes. And insatiable.
it's about not aging before your time.
you don't understand. Aging isn't the problem.
dying the proper way, that is the problem.
not if you've lived a life without regret.
how on earth does one do that?
regret. It piles up around us like books we never read.
well, that's the past.
can you live the rest of your life without regret?
Yes, perhaps. If I feel I have done something truly great for my country.
something my children would have found important.
would have?
you're incredibly beautiful.
I hope Jack Ryan realizes how fortunate he is.
ready. - Okay.
go.
okay.
Lemkov's on his way back.
okay, you're on the clock. Three minutes, 37.
seal the elevators.
no one goes in or out.
find Cherevin now!
how advanced is your cirrhosis?
you have a yellow tinge to your skin tone.
spider - web veins on the backs of your hands.
you're stage three, aren't you?
you see? Now we're talking.
excuse me. - No, please take the call.
they tell me I have less than three months but you probably know that because you are clearly a brilliant doctor.
Jack.
hey Teddy it's Jack. I'm in Cherevin's office and I need your help really quick
I'm having dinner with her.
what?
Sarah in Arbitrage.
that's great. Look, I need a favor, Teddy.
I'm at Cherevin. I'm having a little trouble accessing a group file code without a partner - level ABA dodge.
can you grab Rob for me?
I know he's in a meeting right now.
for you, the world.
Jack!
Hey, Rob.
you find anything juicy over there?
Oh, you know, accounts bullshit, hookers and hotels, same old, same old.
did Teddy tell you I need that dodge?
I'll give it to you on one condition.
shoot.
if you get one whiff that FSB is involved in whatever this is, you run, do not walk, to the nearest airport.
they play rough over there, Jack.
under two, Jack. Step it up.
understood. Yeah, understood, Rob.
I worry about you, you know.
Thanks. I appreciate it. Look, I'm a little pressed for time on this end.
ready? - Yeah. Shoot.
four... One...
seven.
you getting this?
one... Eight...
three...
six.
Jack?
we're in.
I'm not there yet. How we doing?
okay, unless he ran the red lights.
back on site.
he ran the red lights. Get out.
got it! Got it!
Jack? You got trouble.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
main elevator is N. G.
we 're working on another exit.
I need it now.
Yep, Yep, Yep
there it is. Private elevator.
back of Cherevin's office. Go.
hit the service entrance button
texting you Cyrillic icon now.
there's an external staircase.
Harper.
Jack.
Jack.
Harper. Harper, can you hear me?
damn it.
I'm flushed. Must be the wine.
or perhaps the company.
are you about to misbehave? - Would you like me to?
I haven't decided yet.
telephone.
Jack, stop.
hurry up, Jack. He's got Cathy and he's on his way back to the building.
duck.
keep moving, Jack.
staircase is clear to the ground. Go.
control, you're on.
Cathy.
I'm so sorry.
did you enjoy your walk, Dr. Ryan?
Mr. Cherevin, I have to apologize. I had too much to drink.
excuse me, Doctor!
yes?
Viktor.
your wallet, let me see it.
what is this?
you missed a fascinating conversation I had with Dr. Muller.
I did? What was that?
things we regret. Let's you and I have that same talk soon.
you know, we should get home. I am so sorry about tonight.
have them followed.
get us to Beta.
copy that. Let's hit the safe house.
we clean the premises and get the hell out of there.
I have max - level data coming in for analysis now.
we are tracking them.
the same old weaknesses, Viktor.
vodka, vanity,
women.
your son would be ashamed.
Ryan has it.
the algorithm's uploading to Langley.
once we break it down... - It's tomorrow.
what? - The sell order.
it's programmed for 9: 06 a. m. Eastern Time.
they're dumping everywhere.
tokyo, London, Shanghai, a dozen other exchanges.
it's almost two trillion. It's gonna be a Wipeout.
that's 18 hours.
how do we stop it?
they're not gonna flood the market unless the terror attack is successful.
they'd lose everything.
and the attack will be coordinated right before that, 9: 00 a. m. tomorrow.
get down!
go, go, go!
albatross, we are compromised at rendezvous Beta. Request immediate backup.
No! Get off me!
get off me!
Cathy!
Jack!
I don't know what you're saying.
Harper. Harper, can you hear me? Do you have her?
are you sure she's wearing it?
Yes! Of course! I put it on her myself!
we played the whole scene for the driver.
now where is she?
got her. It's working.
Jack, send me a ping from yours.
southwest on Kashirskoye Shosse. It's a kilometer from you.
go! Go!
off the highway.
headed north toward Kuznetsky Most.
third exit ahead of you, due north.
I hope you enjoyed your meal.
Cathy.
I hope for her sake you have not yet transmitted the information you stole from me.
I'm going to find you. I'm going to find you.
how far?
nine blocks behind him and closing.
we haven't started transmitting yet. I still have the stick drive.
very good, Jack. Let us hope Cathy and I can believe you.
if not, I have always found that in these situations the swiftest results are achieved by working with loved ones.
you know I have what you want. Put her on the phone!
doctor?
talk to your fianc
Cathy, talk to me!
what? You think your...
silence is in some way heroic?
Cathy!
we will do this other way.
so let me tell you something, Jack.
if you squeeze a neck just right, human beings can't keep their mouths closed.
a light bulb will go into her mouth because in
lubyanka and Lefortovo prisons, we discovered in torture that vacuum glass explosion inside mouth causes damage to...
soft tissue, to enamel, to bone, and to lungs, also.
it's quite a bit of, what do you say, havoc for forty watts.
hard left coming up. Just two blocks and you got him.
push it! - I am!
but when you look at this, Cathy, you will know and, Jack, you will understand, that I am very serious when I say that I want what you stole from me and I want it now.
do you think Jack will get to you?
or do you think he thinks it is a game?
you think this is game, Jack?
you think my country bled for so many years before your feet for game?
Cathy!
you think my son died for game?
you think I will let myself die for nothing?
no, it is America that will soon know what it is to have nothing.
he's got to cut back, Jack.
you can catch him at the corner Run straight ahead.
I put bulb in her mouth, Jack!
now, I have my hand beneath your bitch chin!
and now in moment, I will crush her jaw so she bites down on it and begins slow and painful death!
so, I will say it once more,
I want what you stole from me and I want it now!
Cathy!
come on! Let's go!
let's go. You're all right. - We need to go, now!
keep moving! We need to go!
the attack is going to happen, Ryan!
you can't stop it.
Jack, we need to get out of here. The police are coming!
I got her! She's in! She's in! She's in!
turn it on! Let's move! Let's move!
okay. Here's what we have. Aleksandr Borovsky,
aka Andrew Bernstein, age 23.
last known address, in Dearborn, Michigan.
move, move, move!
let's go!
cover my six!
the location's burned. They're up and out recently.
they leave anything? - Ashes and melted plastic.
FBI was tipped that he might be a sleeper agent.
a sleeper agent who was handpicked. This guy was groomed for it.
this is personal.
wait a minute. Cherevin's son.
what?
last night, Cherevin mentioned something about his son having died.
what if he didn't?
cross - referencing Moscow hospital records, coroner's reports.
got it! Aleksandr Cherevin, age nine.
apparently died in a drowning accident, June 2004. Cherevin's own signature is on the certificate.
aleksandr Borovsky entered the country in '04 with his parents.
aleksandr Cherevin, age nine, and Aleksandr Borovsky, age nine.
they're the same kid.
he took a cash advance of $6, 000.
and then he went black? - Right.
by now, he could be anywhere.
Hey, AI. Where you been?
you in some kind of shit?
FBI was crawling all over here yesterday looking for you.
wait. The guy knew that the FBI made his phone.
he would dump it, right? He'd dump it.
michigan Bell. Is there a listing near his house?
bear with me.
off - site delivery?
there's a way into him, I know it. We just got to find it.
all right, drive safe.
that fake death certificate, pull it up again.
Cherevin couldn't do this alone.
that second signature right there.
the attending physician, Mikhail Yureyovich, emigrated to the U. S. in '08.
attained U. S. citizenship two years later.
give me his Social Security number.
377 - 31 - 8622.
perfect. You have that?
the doctor served with Cherevin in Afghanistan.
it looks like he's been subsidized for years by Cherevin's firm.
he's got at least four offshore accounts.
found the pay phone!
six blocks away. - Let me see.
they ran it, but it didn't cross with anything.
all right. All right. Here, here.
someone called a pay phone in Pennsylvania from the pay phone nearest to his house.
Pennsylvania... Pennsylvania... Pennsylvania... Seventeen calls.
that's it! That's it. That's it.
we're searching for recent nonresidential real estate transactions made by Yureyovich.
like a warehouse or storage facility.
got it. Barn at 211 Swallowsdale Road and same zip code as the pay phone.
sold six months ago to Dr. Mikhail Yureyovich. All cash.
he's in Pennsylvania.
nobody blows up Pennsylvania, Jack.
Tom, he's in Pennsylvania.
you're going to Pennsylvania.
that's right. Get FBI to that barn.
I need people there now. Thank you.
we still don't know where the attack's gonna come, Jack.
if Borovsky's on the move, we need to know where the hell he's going.
cell phone triangulation. Where does this guy travel to?
where has he gone? - Michigan, Michigan.
Michigan. He hasn't been anywhere.
bullshit! We're not digging hard enough!
everybody goes somewhere.
it's his parents.
they're a unit, right? They're a unit. If he didn't travel somewhere, maybe they did. Where did they go?
did they post pictures online?
no, no, no. They wouldn't do that. They're too smart for that.
we're looking for extended family. Look for extended family.
Oh, did they hit anybody's Instagram, Facebook, Hopscotch? Reddit?
Nope, none.
here. Image Locker. An uncle in New York
Borovsky's father accessed the account from his phone four times, right here.
put it up on the main screen. Get it up.
they're going to hit Manhattan.
Jesus.
our guy never went to New York.
he had someone scout it for him. and they posted the pictures so he could plan the attack.
wait, wait, stop.
back up.
there, that.
you know that building?
Jack works there. it's Wall Street. - Oh, Jesus.
an attack on downtown Manhattan.
I'd say that'd start a panic.
get me Harper.
feds just uncovered evidence suggesting he camouflaged a van stolen from work.
discarded tags, auto paint, paint thinner.
tire tracks indicate we're looking for a Ford Econoline, white or blue body, long wheel base.
tell FBI we can be at the site in ten minutes.
Dr. Muller, there's a car to take you home.
an agent will stay with you.
no. Take me to Lennox Hill Hospital. They might need me.
if I don't make it back...
look. I will see you tonight. We're having dinner.
and we're gonna split the check.
sir? Excuse me. The chopper is ready.
have you been in one since?
don't worry about me.
I haven't yet.
move! Bomb disposal going in!
the market has opened in New York, Mr. Cherevin.
margin calls from creditors are imminent.
do we sell?
not yet.
please proceed as directed by officers.
I repeat, a total evacuation...
Jesus Christ.
emergency vehicles only are allowed access beyond this perimeter:
emergency vehicles only...
we got a dozen ESU trucks coming in right now.
I put the alert out to the FBI and Counterterrorism to expand the EBU's search to a 30 - block radius.
no, this isn't right.
I repeat, emergency vehicles only are allowed access beyond this perimeter:
I want air traffic shut down over the city.
emergency vehicles only are allowed access beyond this perimeter:
Harper!
Harper!
Harper!
Teddy!
Jack! I thought you were in Moscow.
I was. I need the bike.
Jack!
we recommend immediate execution of sell orders.
wait.
Jack.
I got him! - Jack, where are you?
it's a diversion!
the painting in Cherevin's office, it's right out of Napoleon 's playbook. It's Waterloo!
he's not going to the building, he's going under it!
Jack?
Jack!
I need a cross - section of what's underneath this building. I need it now.
the greatest upward blast amplification, where would it be?
the convection chimney. Here.
if the force of the blast is channeled up through it, you're looking at shock over pressure, six or seven buildings come down.
Jesus. That's half of Wall Street.
let's get this thing up!
come on, clear the area! We got to move!
open it.
secure the ropes. We're going down!
Oh, God, no.
trading is about to be suspended in New York.
Mr. Cherevin, we need to act now.
please... Aleksandr.
where are you, Jack? I've got people coming to you!
we got nothing here, Harper!
the sell - off's programmed for 9: 06, that's two minutes from now.
Harper, we're not talking about 10 or 15, 000 people. More like 100, 000.
just get me a clear path to the water!
head north on Front Street.
sorokin wants to meet you now.
it was always for Russia.
so is this.
you didn't pick this life. I did.
but I picked you.
I can't even kiss you.
Yeah, you can. - That side?
it doesn't hurt that much. - Really? You sure?
commander Harper? Dr. Ryan? They're ready for you.
direct. Clear.
concise. If he doesn't ask, he doesn't want to know.
okay.
any way you can get that boy - scout - on - a - field - trip look off your face?
not a chance.
that's what I like about you.
Harper, when do you ever sleep?
you know what, don't answer that.
I kind of like the idea that you don't. Let me keep thinking it.
and what's your name, son?
Ryan, Mr. President. Jack Ryan.
once upon a time, on the North Shore of Long lsland, some 30 miles from New York, there lived a small girl on a large estate.
the estate was very large indeed and had many servants.
there were gardeners to take care of the gardens and a tree surgeon on a retainer.
there was a boatman to put the boats in the water in the spring and scrape their bottoms in the winter.
there were specialists to take care of the grounds, the outdoor tennis court and the indoor tennis court, the outdoor swimming pool and the indoor swimming pool.
and a man of no particular title took care of a small pool in the garden for a goldfish named George.
also on the estate there was a chauffeur by the name of Fairchild, who had been imported from England years ago, together with a new Rolls-Royce.
Fairchild was a fine chauffeur of considerable polish, like the eight cars in his care.
and he had a daughter by the name of... Sabrina.
lt was the eve of the annual six-metre yacht races and, as had been traditional for the past 30 years, the Larrabees were giving a party.
lt never rained on the night of the Larrabee party.
the Larrabees wouldn't have stood for it.
there were four Larrabees in all, father, mother and two sons.
Maude and Oliver Larrabee were married in 1906.
among their many wedding presents was a town house in New York and this estate for weekends.
the town house has since been converted into Saks Fifth Avenue.
linus Larrabee, the elder son, graduated from Yale, where his classmates voted him the man most likely to leave his alma mater $50 million.
his brother, David, went through several of the best Eastern colleges for short periods of time, and through several marriages for even shorter periods of time.
he is now a successful six-goal polo player and is listed on Linus's tax return as a $600 deduction.
life was pleasant among the Larrabees, for this was as close to heaven as one could get on Long lsland.
come on down from there, Sabrina! Come on.
you'd better go and finish your packing.
who's that girl, Father, dancing with David?
her name is Gretchen Van Horn. Chase National Bank.
l hate girls that giggle all the time.
you hate every girl David looks at.
you can't go on like this about David. You've got to get over it.
Yes, Father.
lt's good you're going away. l only hope it's far enough.
Yes, Father. - Come along, Sabrina.
ln a minute, Father. You go ahead. l'll be up soon.
Oh, it's you, Sabrina. - Hello, David.
l thought l heard somebody.
no, it's nobody.
Gretchen! Yoo-hoo! Tennis, anyone?
what is this, mixed singles?
No! You have to stay on your side of the net.
that'll be a little difficult, Gretchen.
you know the rules of the game. - OK, l'll serve.
Sabrina!
Sabrina...
Yes, Father? - Don't leave your passport tomorrow.
lt's not every girl that's lucky enough to go to Paris.
and it's the best cooking school in the world.
lf your mother were alive, she'd be happy you were going there.
she was the best cook on Long lsland.
l'm not saying you have to be a cook, as she was, or that l want you to marry a chauffeur.
but you know how l feel.
your mother and l had a good life together.
we were respected by everyone.
that's as much as anyone can want.
don't reach for the moon, child.
no, father.
besides, it never hurt a young girl to learn how to cook, did it?
l'll wake you at seven. The boat goes at noon. Good night.
good night.
what's going on?
Fairchild! Fairchild!
anybody here?
who's that?
Sabrina, come out of there.
come on, out of there.
hello.
what are you doing here?
just checking the spark plugs. - The what?
father was worried because a spark plug was missing.
l wanted to find out which one it was.
so you started all the motors?
l didn't want to disturb anyone. - You might never have done so again.
does your father know? - No! l wanted to surprise him.
we'd better get out.
there now. Breathe deep.
that's right. Now deeper.
what happened? - You passed out.
l'm all right. You don't have to carry me.
of all the idiotic things...
haven't you ever heard of carbon monoxide? lt kills people.
what would have happened if l hadn't come along?
l'd have died. - And fast.
eight cars! One would have done it.
good thing Mrs Van Horn asked me to drive her home.
Mrs Van Horn? Gretchen's mother?
why didn't she drive her home? - We can't find Gretchen.
she... - She what?
nothing.
the next time you start a car, leave the garage doors open. Understand?
a chauffeur's daughter should know better.
Yes, sir.
Bonjour, mesdames et messieurs!
yesterday we have learnt the correct way how to boil water.
today we will learn the correct way how to crack an egg.
voil, an egg!
now an egg is not a stone. lt is not made of wood.
lt is a living thing with a heart.
so when we crack it we must not torment it.
we must be merciful and execute it quickly, like with the guillotine.
lt is done with one hand. Kindly watch the wrist.
voil. One, two, three, crack!
you see? lt is all in the wrist.
and now, everybody, take an egg.
one, two, three, crack!
new egg.
one, two, three, crack!
new egg. One, two, three, crack!
new egg. One, two, three, crack!
take an egg. Crack!
the wrist, huh? Like a whip. You watch.
one, two, three, crack! New egg.
one, two, three, crack!
new egg. One, two, three, crack!
new egg. One, two...
'dear Father, or Cher Papa as we say over here. "
'lsn't my French getting good? "
'we finally finished our four-week course in sauces, thank goodness! "
'Soups were tough but sauces just about killed me. "
'l almost flunked my hollandaise. lt kept separating on me. "
too much vinegar. Does she mention David?
mr Linus is ready to go into town.
what does she say about David? - Not a word.
no, wait. Here's something.
'l don't think of David very much. " - That's good.
'Except at night. " - That's bad.
'l decided to be sensible and tore up his picture. "
that's good.
'please mail me some Scotch tape. " - That's bad.
morning, Fairchild. - Morning, sir. Beautiful day, sir.
take the Parkway. Two windows open. 35 miles an hour.
morning. Where are you off to?
the office, where do you think? - On Sunday?
today is Wednesday. - Wednesday?
this is KL 75263. Get me Bowling Green 91 099.
good morning, Miss McCardle. How did the market open?
lndustrials, 24 7. 63. Up a dollar, ten.
rails, 94. 7. Up 58 cents.
utilities, 4 7. 23. Off 1 1 cents.
l'm just leaving. Put the coffee on in 45 minutes.
lnter-office memo to David Larrabee.
dear David, you are a junior partner of Larrabee lndustries, located at 30 Broad Street, New York.
your office is on the 22nd floor.
our normal week is Monday to Friday. Our working day is nine to five.
lf this is inconvenient you may retire with your pension.
after one year, your entitlement is 65 cents a month for the rest of your life.
what did you hear from your daughter?
she still loves him. - l beg your pardon?
l mean she loves the cooking school, sir.
but she'll get over it.
and now, mesdames et messieurs, soon we will see how you have learnt the lesson of the souffl.
the souffl, it must be gay. Gay.
like two butterflies dancing the waltz in the summer breeze.
very well. You have five seconds!
four seconds.
three seconds. Two seconds.
one second.
to the ovens!
too low.
too pale.
too heavy.
too low.
too high. You are exaggerating.
fair.
so-so.
sloppy.
Mmm! Superb! My dear Baron, you have not lost your touch.
much too low.
l don't know what happened. - l will tell you.
you forgot to turn on the oven.
l have been watching you.
your mind has not been on the cooking. lt has been elsewhere.
you're in love. And l will venture to go a step further.
you are unhappily in love. - Does it show?
very clearly. A woman happily in love, she burns the souffl.
a woman unhappily in love, she forgets to turn on the oven.
am l correct? - Yes. But l'm trying to get over it.
why try to get over it? You speak of love like it was a bad cough.
he doesn't even know l exist. l might as well be reaching for the moon.
the moon?
Oh, you young people are so old-fashioned!
have you not heard? We are building rockets to reach the moon.
to begin with, you must stop looking like a horse.
horse?
'his name is Baron Saint Fontanel. "
Baron?
'he came here for a refresher course in souffls "
'and liked me so much he decided to stay on for the fish. "
what does she say about David? - David? She's got a baron!
'the Baron is 7 4 years old... "
'...and very sweet and very wise. "
'he has a box at the opera, a racing stable, wonderful paintings "
'and his own vineyards. "
'tomorrow night he is taking me to a very fashionable charity ball, "
'and l have a dress just for the occasion. "
'lf David could only see me in it. "
'Yards of skirt and way off the shoulders. "
good morning, sir.
what's going on? - A letter from Sabrina.
wouldn't you like to read it? There's something about you.
poor Sabrina. - What's wrong with him?
he's getting married again.
he is? - Number four.
who says so?
Cholly Knickerbocker. Don't you people ever read the society columns?
ls my brother in? - Yes, but he's very busy.
l want to see him.
l want to see him now! - l'm sorry. l have my orders.
he's working on the plastics deal.
press that button, or l'll break that door down using you as a battering ram!
mr David! - Make up your mind!
Linus, l want to talk to you!
ask for an appointment. - Don't give me that! l'm mad!
all right, gentlemen, l'll be ten minutes.
now what's the trouble?
how did this get in the paper?
'david Larrabee is to marry again. "
'the girl is Elizabeth Tyson of the Oyster Bay Tysons. "
Congratulations. - Did you plant this?
lt's common knowledge about you and Elizabeth Tyson. Don't you like her?
l like her a lot. l like a lot of girls a lot.
you can say that again. - What are you doing with that gun?
put that thing away, Linus!
look at that. The greatest plastic ever made. Not a scratch.
l wonder how this'd stand up against a bazooka?
miss McCardle, ask General Stanton if we can borrow a bazooka.
Yes, Mr Larrabee.
to get back to my problem... - Lend me your lighter.
Linus, l have no intention of marrying Elizabeth Tyson!
doesn't burn, doesn't scorch, doesn't melt. How about that!
l've been married before. l've had it three times.
this time the family approves.
you're going to do something constructive. Taste it.
what's constructive about marrying her?
taste it. - lt's sweet.
lt's made of sugar cane.
sugar cane. Wait a minute...
the Tysons own the largest holdings of sugar cane in Puerto Rico!
second largest. The largest have no daughter.
lt's all beginning to make sense.
mr Tyson owns the sugar cane, you own the formula for the plastics and l'm offered as a sacrifice on the altar of industrial progress!
you make it sound as if the son of the hot dog dynasty had to marry the daughter of the mustard king.
surely you don't object to Elizabeth because her father has $20 million?
that's very narrow-minded of you.
just one thing. l haven't proposed and she hasn't accepted.
Oh, don't worry. l proposed and Mr Tyson accepted.
did you kiss him? - Elizabeth is a lovely girl.
sooner or later you'll propose. l'm helping you make up your mind.
then you marry her. - Me?
what's so funny?
lf l got married, l'd have to take a Dictaphone, two secretaries and four corporation counsellors along on the honeymoon.
l'd be unfaithful to my wife every night with vice presidents, boards of directors, slide-rule accountants...
this... this is my home. No wife would ever understand it.
nor me. You've got all the money in the world.
making money isn't the main point of business. Money is a by-product.
what's the main objective? Power? - Ah! That's become a dirty word.
what's the urge? You're going into plastics. What will that prove?
prove? Nothing much.
a new product has been found, something of use to the world.
a new industry moves into an undeveloped area.
factories go up, machines go in and you're in business.
lt's coincidental that people who've never seen a dime now have a dollar and barefooted kids wear shoes and have their faces washed.
what's wrong with an urge that gives people libraries, hospitals, baseball diamonds and movies on a Saturday night?
send in the secretaries. - Yes, Mr Larrabee.
you make me feel like a heel.
lf l don't marry her, some kid will run around Puerto Rico barefoot!
look at this stuff. Planes and suits will be made of it and you'll probably be able to eat it.
we're organising Larrabee Plastics. Larrabee Construction has the plans.
Larrabee Shipping bought nine more freighters to handle the traffic.
the wheels are in motion already? - That's what l mean.
would you demonstrate the weight test to Mr David, please?
Linus, l believe you. - Up you go.
l want you to see how resilient it is.
bounce, please, ladies.
some plastic, eh?
we'd like a summer wedding to get in on this year's sugar crop.
Yeah.
l think you're going to be very happy.
dearest Father, we shall be graduating next week and l shall be getting my diploma.
l want to thank you now for the two most wonderful years of my life.
l shall always love you for sending me here.
lt is late at night and someone across the way is playing La Vie En Rose.
lt is the French way of saying, " l am looking at the world through rose-coloured glasses. "
lt says everything l feel.
l have learnt so many things, Father.
not just how to make vichyssoise or calf's head with sauce vinaigrette, but a much more important recipe.
l have learnt how to live, how to be in the world and of the world...
and not just to stand aside and watch.
and l will never, never again run away from life, or from love, either.
l am taking the plane home on Friday, Father.
you needn't pick me up at the airport.
l'll just take the Long lsland Rail Road and you can meet me at the train, the 4: 1 5.
lf you should have any difficulty recognising your daughter, l shall be the most sophisticated woman at the Glen Cove Station.
taxi, miss? Cheapest rates in Glen Cove.
Hello! How are you?
well, l'm fine. How are you? And l might add, who are you?
who am l? - Am l supposed to know?
no, you're not supposed to know.
are you stranded? - My father was meant to pick me up.
whoever your father is, l'll be eternally grateful.
that is if l can give you a lift. - You can drive me home.
good! l'll get your bags.
where do you live? - Dosoris Lane.
Dosoris Lane? Say, that's where l live!
Really? - Sure. We must be neighbours.
and l believe in loving thy neighbour.
Oh, so do l.
come on, David.
David? ls his name David? - Yes, it is.
that's funny. My name's David, too.
that is funny, isn't it?
sure you don't want to tell me your name?
positive. l'm having much too much fun.
all right, if you want to play games...
have you always lived here? - Most of my life.
l'd swear l know every pretty girl on the North Shore.
you take in more territory than that.
this is maddening. l've seen that face before.
let me see your profile again.
l know l know you.
l have a feeling l've seen you... with your father.
ls your father Admiral Starratt? - Hardly.
funny. l keep seeing him in a uniform.
give us a hint. What does your father do?
he's in transportation. - Transportation?
railroads. New York Central. - No.
planes. TWA. - No.
boats. United States Lines. - No.
l pass. - Automobiles.
Oh? Chrysler?
Yes, Chrysler and Ford and General Motors and Rolls-Royce.
ls he on the board of all those companies?
you might say he runs things.
l bet my brother Linus knows him. - He certainly does.
they often drive into town together.
they do?
straight through to the garage, please.
l feel so stupid l could kill myself. - You'll be all right in a minute.
here we are.
l'm not just pretending we've met somewhere before. We have met...
you don't live here. l live here.
Hi, neighbour!
Sabrina!
Hello, Margaret! lt's so good to be home!
look at you! You've come home such a beautiful lady!
Oh, welcome home, Sabrina!
Ernest! Jenny! How are you?
don't cry, Margaret. lt's nothing to cry about.
l've brought you a hat, a Paris hat for you to wear to church on Sundays.
Jenny, l've got something for you...
father!
l'm sorry. l had to take Mrs Larrabee to the hairdresser.
lt doesn't matter. lt doesn't matter.
l wouldn't have recognised you anyway.
david had a little trouble, didn't you?
Yes. Yes, l did.
l'll make coffee. Will you come to the kitchen?
as soon as l've opened my bags. - l'll take them upstairs.
as old neighbours the two of us should have a reunion.
lt's only fair. - Tonight?
do you really want to see me? - Very much.
sure? - Yes, l'm sure.
all right. - We'll go out on the town.
we'll drive to New York, have a quick drink, then go for dinner.
l know a wonderful French restaurant on First Avenue.
l guess you wouldn't think so much of it after Paris.
l'll love it!
we'll go dancing.
when they throw us out of El Morocco, we'll go to the Village.
you like Dixieland bands? l know the greatest. lt's...
wait, l forgot. We're having a party here tonight.
with an orchestra and dancing? That'll be even more fun.
l don't know. A lot of dull people. Family stuff.
l don't mind if you're there.
Sabrina? - ln a minute, Father.
l have a lovely evening dress with yards of skirt.
shall l wear it? - Yes, of course.
this couldn't be nicer. A homecoming party!
l'll... get the dress out and press it. See you tonight.
Hello, Linus. l'm back!
lt's Sabrina. Would you have recognised her?
that scrawny kid who'd run away when she saw us, her knees painted with Mercurochrome.
how do you like those legs now? Aren't they something?
David, the last pair of legs that were something cost the family $25, 000.
look what l brought you from Paris.
Sabrina, l should have mentioned it in a letter...
here. Do you like it? - But l didn't want to upset you.
aren't they gaudy?
Sabrina, David is engaged. He's getting married again.
l know. Margaret wrote me.
brandy. And this is for you to wear on your day off.
then you don't care? - Not too much. He's not married yet.
l don't like that. l don't like the sound of it.
father, everything has changed.
nothing's changed. He's still David Larrabee.
and you're still the chauffeur's daughter.
and you're still reaching for the moon.
no, Father. The moon's reaching for me.
l wish the wedding were tomorrow, David.
don't you? - Yes, dear.
ten more days. lt'll seem more like ten years.
Yes, dear.
father had planned for us to fly to Honolulu afterwards. l said no.
l don't want to spend the first 1 8 hours of my honeymoon in a plane.
do you? - Yes, dear.
David! - What? l mean, no. What did you say?
aren't you interested? - Of course, dear.
aren't they a sweet couple! - Charming. Elizabeth is lovely.
why do young men wear white jackets in the evening? They look like barbers!
now, Oliver... - My throat's dry.
have you been smoking? - l've stopped smoking.
lt's sad that after 48 years of marriage distrust should creep into our relationship.
l'll join the men in the library.
David? l think l ought to have a talk with your chauffeur.
what for?
father wants to give me a car and your chauffeur could tell me...
sure, sure. Of course.
what's his name? - Sabrina.
l mean Fairchild. l'll talk to him. Don't bother.
all right, darling. l know you'll take care of everything.
what is it, David?
would you like to get some food? - No, thank you.
a drink? - No.
l'm terribly sorry! - lt's my fault. l didn't see you.
will it wash out? - Yes.
you'd better do it now. - Come on, Elizabeth. l'll help you.
Sabrina!
David!
hello. - You look wonderful.
thank you. l'm a bit late. - l worried.
were you afraid l'd forgotten the address?
lt crossed my mind. Shall we dance? - Right here?
who is that girl? - l don't know.
l wonder what happened to Elizabeth.
what a lovely party. - lt is now.
the nicest one you've ever had. And l've been to all your parties.
you have? - Standing up there in that tree.
Sabrina, if l'd only known.
Oh, Sabrina, Sabrina, where have you been all my life?
right over the garage. - Right over my car.
right up in that tree. What a fool l was.
and what a crush l had on you.
lt's not too late, is it?
l don't know, David. ls it?
you should see her! You should see Sabrina!
the prettiest girl. The prettiest dress. The best dancer. The belle of the ball.
lt's as if she belonged up there. - l don't like it.
ls she dancing with David? - That's right.
he's holding her so close l don't see how she can breathe.
and the way they look into each other's eyes...
l don't like it. - Tom, be happy for her.
this is what she wanted. lt's where she belongs.
lt's not. And it's not where l belong.
remember the chauffeur on the Harrington estate?
his daughter fell in love with the son.
next he was driving the family to the church, changing his uniform and then giving the bride away. That's not for me, l don't like it.
that was 25 years ago.
come on. Let's sneak up and see her.
David?
Hello, Mother. - l don't know this lady.
you do. - Good evening, Mrs Larrabee.
mother, this is Miss Fairchild. - Sabrina?
Yes, of course.
Yes, of course.
of course. Sabrina.
you didn't recognise me, did you? Have l changed?
you certainly have. You look lovely, Sabrina.
l thought it'd be fun to ask her to the party as a welcome home.
David's been wonderful. He met me at the station.
did he? How nice of him.
she's been to Paris. - Yes, l know.
come and cook something very special for us, Sabrina.
l want to see what you've learnt. - l've learnt a lot.
Bye.
this is such fun. So much more fun than just watching from that tree.
l'm glad you came home. l'll never let you go away again.
never? - Never.
would you like to kiss me?
would l? - Yes. A nice, steady kiss.
not on roller skates this time. - Roller skates?
you don't remember? - l remember l had a pair.
l was nine and you had your arms around me because you were teaching me to skate backwards.
suddenly, you kissed me. l've never forgotten.
Sabrina, let's get out of here. - Yes, let's.
l tell you what. You slip away first. l'll meet you at...
the indoor tennis court.
and you'll bring champagne. - Of course.
you saw a lot from that tree!
will you have the orchestra play lsn't lt Romantic?
naturally.
Where's David? - He's being a good host.
l'll get him out of circulation. Thank you.
got a minute, David? - Not now.
the old man wants to see you. - l'm busy.
he's frothing at the mouth.
what about? - You guess.
animal, vegetable or mineral? - Definitely animal.
Linus, this boy should be drummed out of the family!
what have l done now?
l'm not saying all Larrabees have been saints.
thomas Larrabee was hung for piracy. Benjamin Larrabee was a slave trader.
and Joshua Larrabee was shot while attempting to rob a train.
but no Larrabee has behaved as you have behaved tonight!
exactly what have l done? - Done?
father, remember your basal metabolism.
making love to a servant in your mother's house!
she is not a servant. - She's a servant's daughter.
you have embarrassed your mother and our chauffeur.
l've too much respect for Fairchild to intrude on his personal life.
you should have that respect for her.
l have so much respect for her l invited her.
that's overdoing it. - l love her!
he loves her! Next thing he'll elope with the girl in the middle of the night!
maybe! - l'll overlook you're an engaged man and remind you of your marital record to date.
l know, Father. l made three mistakes.
first, that Hungarian countess, who married you to bring her family over.
her parents and five brothers, all of them needing costly dental repairs!
do we have to go through it again? - Then that Twyman girl.
her family 50 years on the social register.
she wore on her wedding dress not a corsage but a Stevenson button!
you promised not to swear. - Then that great actress!
all she does is commercials on television for an underarm deodorant.
and now our chauffeur's daughter!
father, are you through? - l am not through!
l'm sure Linus has a few words to say.
l do. But you won't like them, Father. You're being unfair to David.
David's old enough to live his life.
lf she's the girl for him... - Nonsense!
you really mean that? lt would knock your plans.
the plastics merger? Forget it. lf you love her, take her.
this is the 20th century. - The 20th century?
l could pick a century out of a hat and get a better one!
you will get rid of that girl and apologise to your fiance!
now, Father, don't push him. Let's discuss this like civilised people.
sit down, David. - Thank you, Linus.
l have to go. You two work it out.
do you want me to help you? Then sit down.
you're the only one who understands.
what is it? What happened? - Champagne glasses. l sat on them.
on the chair?
Sabrina?
hello.
you did order champagne, didn't you?
what are you doing here? - David sent me.
lsn't he coming? - l don't think he can make it.
what happened? - He got stuck.
stuck? - Nothing serious. One of those things.
shall l serve it up there or will you come down?
up there? All right. - No, l'll come down.
we meet under the most peculiar circumstances.
either you're under eight cars looking for a spark plug or you're up here umpiring a tennis match between two imaginary players.
Oh, you look lovely, Sabrina. And very grown up.
l'll get back to the party. - And leave me here?
what did David say? - l haven't seen him in such a state since he was kicked in the head by a polo pony.
that's nice. - Amnesia has definitely set in.
he's completely forgotten he's engaged. He wants you.
and l want him. l've been in love with him all my life.
there goes the engagement! - You don't object?
object? To you? lt's as though a window had been thrown open and a lovely breeze swept through this stuffy house. How could l object?
even though the breeze comes from the garage?
this is the 20th century, Sabrina.
thank you. Let's drink to that.
sorry it isn't David here instead of me. But it's all in the family.
when you walked in, l was sure you'd been sent by the family to deal with me.
to deal with you? - Like in a Viennese operetta.
the young prince falls in love with a waitress and the prime minister is sent to buy her off.
buy her off? - Yes.
he offers her 5, 000 kronen. " No, " she says.
'1 0, 000? " " No. "
1 5, 000 kronen? - No.
25, 000 kronen? - No.
25, 000 dollars? - No. How did dollars get into this?
25, 000 dollars after taxes, that's a lot of money.
what are you saying? - l'm making it worthwhile.
no self-respecting prime minister would offer kronen.
no self-respecting waitress would take dollars.
good girl.
say, how does this operetta end? What's the last act?
l don't know. l guess they run away to America on a zeppelin with everybody singing like mad.
they open a brewery in Milwaukee? - Yes.
a love that made Milwaukee famous. - Prosit.
there it is.
the song they were playing the night before l went away.
david was right here, dancing it with somebody else.
tonight, l wanted it to be me.
lt's all in the family.
how can we make sure that all the fragments have been removed?
simple. We will reconstruct the two champagne glasses.
l cannot possibly be hurting you. The area has been anaesthetised.
lt's not you. lt's that song.
Sabrina? - Hmm?
lf David were here now, you'd expect him to kiss you, wouldn't you?
here's a kiss from David.
lt's all in the family.
come in. - Hi!
how do you feel? - l never felt better in my life.
you look fine. Has the anaesthetic worn off?
l guess it has. l brought you a present.
what happened last night? Was Sabrina mad because l didn't show up?
not mad, just disappointed.
poor kid. What did you tell her? - The truth.
that the family objected to her, but you stood up like a man, and sat down like a jerk.
23 stitches.
this ought to make you feel better.
a plastic hammock? - Uh-huh.
with a trapdoor. l designed it and ran it off this morning.
on Sunday?
you were in pain, so l had 'em open up the plant.
what a brother!
let's try it on for size. Come on. On your feet.
l'll never drink champagne again.
what do you think of Sabrina? - Wonderful girl.
were you nice to her? - As nice as l could be.
what a brother. l'm still trying to finish my poem to her.
what rhymes with glass? - Glass... Glass...
alas. - Of course.
right on the nose. - Linus!
sorry, David.
lf Sabrina were only here.
how about smuggling her up here? - What if Father sees her?
Yeah, we wouldn't want to spoil it. - No, we sure wouldn't.
Linus, do me a favour. - Any time.
lt's a bore for you, but could you keep an eye on Sabrina?
l already am. We're going sailing this afternoon.
sailing? - ln your boat.
honest? Oh, Sabrina... Tell her we'll be off, just the two of us, the moment the stitches are out.
you've already made up your mind? - Absolutely. This is it.
l wanted to make sure. lt's been it three times before.
l was blind. lt's been Sabrina since we were kids. l just couldn't see it.
what about Elizabeth, Father and Mother?
Elizabeth will be so broken up she'll buy three new hats.
mother will go to bed with a severe headache.
father will take to the bottle and threaten to exile me to Butte, Montana.
that's where you come in. - How?
l don't want to go to Montana. You are going to help me?
Oh, yes, l'm going to help you, aren't l...?
what a brother...
how's my poor darling?
l brought you six books and Scrabble.
l'm in no condition to play Scrabble!
that's all you are in a condition to do.
why were those glasses in your pocket?
l was taking them to the tennis court. Somebody was waiting.
there was a game going on. - ln the middle of the night?
Yes, that's why he needed the glasses.
Yes, that's why l needed the glasses.
Ow!
shall we play three-handed? - No, l'm going sailing.
Yes, he's got to go sailing. - No more false moves now.
Yes, Linus. - We don't want any complications.
so long, Elizabeth. So long, Scarface.
good afternoon, Father. - l thought it was your mother.
l don't mind you smoking in my room, but not in my closet.
lt's good for the moths. Now, that girl over the garage...
david wants to run off with her. - With the chauffeur's daughter?
l don't care who he runs off with so long as it's not the plastics merger.
lt's simple. We'll fire Fairchild. - Not after 25 years.
then a nice cheque will make her forget David.
she doesn't want money, she wants love.
didn't they discontinue that model?
the last of the romantics. L'amour, toujours l'amour.
why pick on David? Why not someone else?
we will do our best.
ls that the idea? Have you got someone in mind for her?
Yep. - Who?
Oh, no! - What's the matter?
not you, Linus? - lt's no fun for me.
l've got a whole deskful of work. There's the sulphur deal.
the Puerto Rican operation has to be set in motion.
and l'm about to make an ass of myself with a girl of 22.
look at me! Joe College, with a touch of arthritis.
could you use this, sailing into the sunset?
l wish l were dead. - Just a thought.
music might help. l had a portable phonograph in my freshman days.
l only hope you remember what to do with a girl.
lt'll come back to me. lt's like riding a bicycle.
this is a very unusual song. ls it popular?
Oh, yes. - Why haven't l heard it?
you've been in Paris for two years.
how did they think of those words? - They are clever, aren't they?
may l play another? - Of course.
you need dusting. - l beg your pardon?
l didn't mean you, Linus! - Thank you.
how's David? - Better, now he's flat on his back.
l miss him. Not that l'm not having a good time.
Sabrina, would you mind if we... turned this off?
Why? - Because.
don't you like it? - l used to like it.
certain songs bring back memories to me, too.
did you love her? - l'd rather not talk about it.
l'm sorry. - That's all right.
so strange to think of you being touched by a woman.
l always thought you walked alone. - No man walks alone from choice.
as a child, l used to watch you from the window over the garage.
coming and going, always wearing your black homburg, carrying a briefcase and an umbrella.
l thought you could never belong to anyone, never care for anyone.
Oh, yes, the cold businessman, way up in his executive suite.
just ice water in his veins, ticker tape coming from his heart.
and yet one day, that same cold businessman, high up in a skyscraper, opens the window, steps out on a ledge, stands there for three hours, wondering...if he should jump.
because of her? - No, that was another woman.
Sabrina, do you find it hard to believe someone might want to blot out everything, for sentimental reasons?
l believe it! lt was for sentimental reasons that l...
l went to Paris to blot it out.
maybe you should go to Paris.
lt helped me. Have you ever been there?
Oh, yes. Once. l was there for 35 minutes.
changing planes on my way to lraq on an oil deal.
but Paris isn't for changing planes. lt's for changing your outlook.
for throwing open the windows and letting in...
letting in la vie en rose.
Paris is for lovers. Maybe that's why l stayed only 35 minutes.
Hi, David. Hello, Father.
Margaret has some dinner for you in the kitchen.
funny. l used to be so afraid of him.
aren't you hungry?
father, you've driven Linus for so many years.
what do you know about him?
a chauffeur keeps his eyes on the road.
only once in a while does he glimpse in the rear-view mirror.
lf you looked a little longer, Father, you'd find him nice.
and quite human.
good morning, Miss McCardle. First, a wire to Hannegang, Fort Worth.
unable to attend Larrabee Sulphur board meeting.
slight hitch in plastics merger. Got that?
next. Here's the itinerary for tonight.
l want two tickets to The Seven Year ltch.
table for two at The Colony before the show, table for two at The Persian Room after the show. A corner table, dark.
l'm just passing La Guardia field. Put the coffee on in ten minutes.
Fairchild, l need you tonight. - Yes, sir.
l'm taking Sabrina out again. - Yes, sir.
would you have her at my office at seven?
Yes, sir. - Anything wrong, Fairchild?
l would prefer not to be involved in these dates with my daughter.
lt makes for a rather awkward situation.
that never occurred to me. Sorry. - lt's just not right, sir.
l like to think of life as a limousine.
we're all driving together, but there's a front seat, a back seat and a window in between.
Fairchild, l never realised it, but you're a terrible snob.
Yes, sir.
have her drive in herself, in David's car.
thank you, sir. lt's all so distressing.
first Mr David, now you. l wish Sabrina had stayed in Paris.
so do l.
may l ask, sir, what exactly are your intentions?
my intentions? Unethical, reprehensible but very practical.
l'm shipping your daughter back to Paris.
you are, sir? - l'm going to try to.
may l ask how, sir? - First class, of course.
don't worry about money.
lt's not money l'm worried about. lt's Sabrina.
l don't want her to get hurt. - l'll be as gentle as l can.
l hope so. She's just a displaced person.
she doesn't belong in a mansion, but then doesn't belong above a garage either.
the meeting of the board of directors will now come to order.
as chairman, l would like to say at the outset...
the chairman is so dizzy.
meeting adjourned. Have a frozen daiquiri.
l once saw an office like this in Fortune magazine at my dentist's.
has David got an office like this? - Something like this, only larger.
lnstead of a desk, he has a putting green.
please, before my fingers get frostbitten.
ls this the ledge? - What ledge?
you know, the ledge. That woman. When you almost...
Oh, the ledge. Yes. Yes, that's the ledge all right.
what made you not do it?
there were some children playing hopscotch on the sidewalk.
l'm very fond of those children.
look at all these gadgets. You press a button and factories go up.
or you pick up a telephone and 1 00 tankers set out for Persia.
or through a Dictaphone you say, " Buy all of Cleveland and move it to Pittsburgh. " You must be clever.
lt's just a knack, like juggling three oranges.
lt isn't oranges, it's millions. Suppose you dropped one?
suppose l did? What's at the end of a million? Nothing. A circle.
Sabrina... - Yes, Linus?
can you keep a secret? Yes, of course you can.
l want you to look out there. Uptown.
you see the French Line pier? - Yes.
you see the boat? - Yes.
that's the Libert. lt sails on Thursday. l'm going to be on it.
you are? - Yes, l am.
l'm sick of pushing buttons in this office. l'm breaking out, Sabrina.
l'm running away. - Good for you!
l've been thinking about Paris ever since you mentioned it.
lt'll make a new person out of you. You'll double your money back.
l'm so glad you're going.
or am l?
a reservation at The Colony.
ready, Sabrina? Tout de suite, as they say in Paris.
l used your brother's name at The Colony to get the darkest corner!
l'm sorry, Mr Larrabee.
this is what you do on your very first day in Paris.
you get yourself, not a drizzle, but some honest-to-goodness rain, and you find yourself someone really nice and drive her through the Bois de Boulogne in a taxi.
the rain's very important.
that's when Paris smells its sweetest.
lt's the damp chestnut trees. - l see.
you're very clever, Linus, and very rich.
you can order yourself some rain. - Sure.
l can order myself some rain, l can get myself a taxi. That's easy.
but can l find myself someone really nice?
that's not so easy, Sabrina.
how do you say in French, my sister has a yellow pencil?
ma soeur a un crayon jaune.
how do you say, my brother has a lovely girl?
mon frere a une gentille petite amie.
and how do you say, l wish l were my brother?
ll me dit des mots d'amour
des mots de tous les jours
et a me fait quelque chose ll est entr dans mon coeur
une part de bonheur...
why are you looking at me that way?
all night l've had a terrible impulse to do something.
never resist an impulse, Sabrina, especially if it's terrible.
l'm going to do it.
there. - What's that for?
you can't go walking up the Champs Elyses looking like a tourist undertaker! And another thing.
never a briefcase in Paris and never an umbrella. There's a law.
how will l get along in Paris without someone like you?
who'll be there to help me with my French, to turn down the brim of my hat?
suppose you meet someone on the boat the first day? A perfect stranger.
l have a better suppose, Sabrina.
suppose l were ten years younger and you weren't in love with David.
suppose l asked you to...
l suppose l'm just talking nonsense.
l suppose so.
suppose you sing that song again. Slowly.
Hi! l thought you two had eloped. l wouldn't mind, but not in my car.
Hello, David. - Did you have a good time?
so-so. - Where did you go?
we saw The Seven Year ltch and went on to The Persian Room.
lousy dancer, isn't he? - So-so.
l bet he slept through the show then bent your ears about Dow Jones averages and profits taxes.
we talked about a lot of things.
how's your little mishap?
shaping up beautifully. Dr Calaway wants to show it to his class.
l'm sorry, Sabrina. - lt's very funny.
say, Linus, while l was lying in that hammock l got a great idea.
he thinks l'm an idiot. How does this strike you?
plastic champagne glasses, just in case.
brilliant. What else did Dr Calaway say?
stitches come out Thursday. - Thursday?
l'm a fast healer. - You sure are.
so if you two have long-range plans...
l thought she'd like to see the Stock Exchange and our Jersey plant.
Oh, l don't think so.
then we'll just have dinner and go to a show.
but that's all. Come Thursday, the first team takes over.
what's with the homburg?
l guess the undertaker had better turn in.
you'd better crawl back into that hole in your hammock.
au revoir, Sabrina. - Good night, Linus.
he's a little on the dull side, but you can't help liking him.
kiss me, David. - l'd love to, Sabrina.
again.
that's better.
what's the matter? You're not worried about us? l'm not.
there'll be a big stink. Who cares?
David, l don't think l'm going to have dinner with Linus.
l don't want to go out with him. - Why not?
l want to be near you.
l know how you feel. lt must be an awful bore.
but if Linus wants to take you out, be nice about it.
lt's important. He's our only ally.
father will try to cut off my allowance and send me to Larrabee Copper in Montana.
we don't want to go to Butte, Montana, do we?
hold me close, David.
we'll have a wonderful time, darling.
we'll build a raft and drift across the Pacific like Kon-Tiki.
or climb the highest mountain, like Annapurna, just the two of us.
keep talking, David.
we thought pink roses for the cherubs and white gardenias for the names.
lt'll take 2, 000 gardenias. We'll float it in our pool.
lndoor or outdoor? - Outdoor.
we drained the indoor to make room for presents.
Where's the provision determining the ratio of investment to controlling interest?
page 62, paragraph six, subdivision B.
father, where's the list? - Here you are, darling.
would you like to see the invitation list?
.7 40 under trust of lllinois, 550...
the way this merger's worked out, l have all the titles and you have all the controls.
l always make it a point to have controls.
lt's your good luck the kids are fond of each other.
l make it a point to be lucky, too.
come along, Father. Linus, you won't forget the gardenias?
Tony has a sweet idea.
he'll fly over the chapel and throw rice from his plane.
with David the bridegroom, maybe he'd better use wild rice.
all l can say is David better show up at this wedding.
l have a horrible vision of Elizabeth waiting at the altar, and 2, 000 gardenias floating in the pool spelling " disaster " .
memo to Miss McCardle. First, call Brunson in Larrabee Shipping.
we need 2, 000 gardenias.
tell him to start cornering the market.
we're not having trouble with...
l can't remember that garage girl's name.
Sabrina.
what right has a chauffeur got to call her that?
what would you suggest? Ethel?
you've taken her out three nights in a row. ls that situation in hand?
l think so. lt's resolving itself into a straight export deal.
l want two accommodations on the Libert.
one in the name of Sabrina Fairchild. One in my name.
what? You and that girl going off on a boat together?
have l spawned two idiot sons?
who said l was going? She is going. She'll think l am, but l'm not.
ls that clear? - lt is not!
l'll tell Sabrina that l'll meet her on the boat.
when the boat is ten miles out, she'll find out l'm not on the boat.
my cabin will be empty. Just a note of apology and a few presents to soften the blow.
excellent. - Yes, l thought you'd like it.
miss McCardle, l want flowers in Miss Fairchild's cabin.
candy, fruit and the usual what-have-yous.
cable Michot to get her a car in Paris. Also an apartment.
a letter of credit on our Paris bank.
she can draw up to 50, 000. - Easy, now.
transfer to Thomas Fairchild 1 , 000 shares, Larrabee Common.
1 , 000 shares?
make it 1 , 500 shares, Larrabee Preferred.
there must be a less extravagant way of getting a chauffeur's daughter out of one's hair.
how would you do it? You can't even get a little olive out of a jar.
eat it.
going up?
no, thank you.
yes? - Miss Fairchild for you.
send her in. - She's on the phone. lt's on five.
Sabrina? What happened to you? lt's twenty past eight.
good evening, Linus. l know l'm late.
l guess l should have called you earlier.
l can't see you tonight.
l'm sorry. l just can't make it. l tried but l'm all tied up.
no, l'm not in Long lsland. l'm in New York.
downtown in a phone booth. ln a building.
what difference does it make what building?
l can't see you tonight.
all right, it's the Larrabee Building, but l'm not coming up.
look, Sabrina, suppose you tell me exactly what's on your mind, slowly and clearly?
you talk and l'll listen.
lt was really David's idea l go out with you. He wants you to help him.
but it's not helping me. l shouldn't have been seeing you.
l shouldn't be talking to you on the phone.
ln fact, l'm really only calling to say goodbye.
tomorrow, you'll be on the boat to Paris.
ln a way, l'm glad you're going.
you do know what l mean, don't you?
Linus? Hello, Linus?
where are you?
your three minutes are up. - Hello.
lt's silly. l was talking to myself.
you've wasted a dime, too. Come on.
you're not angry? l have a perfectly good reason why l shouldn't see you.
not here, Sabrina.
all right, Sabrina, what is that perfectly good reason why you shouldn't see me?
what is it? What's bothering you?
lt's me that's bothering me.
please don't.
l'm sorry.
l know l'm not making much sense, Linus.
would you like a drink? - l don't think l want a drink.
l think l do.
why don't you sit down? - l can only stay a minute.
mind if l turn on this little one? - lf you want.
l'd hate to fix myself a martini with crme de menthe.
l cancelled your dinner reservation. What about the theatre tickets?
l couldn't possibly go anywhere.
they're all yours, Miss McCardle. Good night.
you're sure you won't have even one?
no, thanks. - You must be hungry.
l hadn't thought about it. - Well, l'm starved.
l was sort of saving myself for 21 tonight.
l've spoiled your evening.
no, you haven't. We can have dinner right here.
let's see what Miss McCardle is hoarding.
probably maraschino cherries and stale crackers.
tomato juice, puffed rice, sardines, tomato juice.
that's an awful lot of tomato juice.
could you fix something out of this?
l suppose so. l'm a graduate cook. l have a diploma.
lt'll take a diploma.
l wanted to be so sure l couldn't go out with you tonight.
and here l am cooking for you.
l guess maybe l should have worn an apron.
one apron, coming up.
pots. Pans. Can opener. Stove.
all the comforts of home.
miss McCardle cooked dinner here for the board of directors.
after the first course, there was a move to adjourn.
lt was passed unanimously.
what do we start with?
l haven't decided yet.
now, Sabrina, let's have none of those.
l'm so ashamed, Linus. - You have no reason to be.
l've known you just a few days, really.
and l've been in love with David all my life.
l can't understand what's the matter with me.
l went away to grow up and l thought l had grown up.
l guess l haven't, really.
l just got myself a new hairdo, that's all.
please say something. - Like what?
l don't know. Tell me l'm imagining things.
tell me you never thought of taking me on the boat to Paris with you.
tell me to put on my coat and go home before l make a complete fool of myself.
don't let me go home. l couldn't bear it.
this is the last time we'll see each other.
l'll behave. l'm all right now. - That's good. How about dinner?
l just remembered l didn't have any lunch today. Or any breakfast.
that may account for a lot of things.
would you like a souffl for dessert? - Out of tomato juice?
out of crackers, of course. - Not too soggy.
you'd better get out of the kitchen.
which one is the Libert?
the one on the right. - Are you sure?
you mustn't take the wrong boat. - l'll try not to.
you haven't forgotten my instructions, have you?
never an umbrella in Paris, and under all circumstances rain the very first day.
l haven't forgotten a word, Sabrina.
my sister has a yellow pencil.
ma soeur a un crayon jaune.
very good. Trs bien.
watch. One, two, three, crack.
new egg. lt's all in the wrist.
there must be an egg beater somewhere.
Linus!
why didn't you tell me? You do want to take me with you, don't you?
these don't mean what you think they mean.
l know why you didn't tell me. You think it's wrong.
they'll say l'm too young, there'll be a scandal, and the market will go down.
linus Larrabee, Esquire is taking me to Paris.
Sabrina, l...wasn't going to take you to Paris.
l was going to send you.
alone? - Yes, all alone.
but there's a ticket for you. - For an empty cabin.
you were joining me in Paris? - l'm afraid not.
l think l understand. - l'm sorry.
but why? Why did you do it, Linus?
high finance. Expansion. Marriage. A merger.
a new plaque on the Larrabee Building. You got in the way.
David? - That's right.
how inconsiderate of me.
and how inconvenient for you, such a busy man, having to waste so much time to get me on a boat.
l'm ashamed to say l enjoyed every minute of it.
and l suppose, in your empty cabin, there would have been a farewell note, dictated to and typed by Miss McCardle?
and perhaps a few flowers. - A little more than that.
a letter of credit. An apartment in Paris. A car.
1 , 500 shares of Larrabee Preferred for your father.
you're very generous.
we regard it as a necessary business expense.
l'll just take one of those tickets.
l was happy in Paris.
l think you would have been, too.
good night, Mr Larrabee.
l'm sorry l can't stay to do the dishes.
good morning. - Good morning.
mr Larrabee? - Come in, Miss McCardle.
good morning. - You're late.
l had to make my own coffee. Worst ever.
sorry. l had a very bad night. - l know exactly how you feel.
you better get that pad. We have things to do.
l used your theatre tickets and took my mother.
are you ready? Call Larrabee Shipping.
tell them to radio our tankers bound for Puerto Rico to turn back.
tell Larrabee Construction to stop work on the plant.
we're cancelling the merger. - We are?
l want Mr Larrabee Senior,
mr Tyson and Miss Elizabeth Tyson here in this office.
get a large bottle of smelling salts.
we're calling off the wedding. - We are?
when's your mother's birthday? l'm sending her 2, 000 gardenias.
here's a ticket for the Libert. Transfer it to the name of David Larrabee.
get his passport out. Make sure it's in order.
locate David. The boat sails at noon.
l've called the house and he isn't there.
try Dr Calaway. Try everywhere, but get him.
do you want me to send those presents to Miss Fairchild's cabin?
no. We're sending David instead. - Good morning.
the stitches are out. lt's as good as new.
Congratulations. l've been looking for you.
l've been looking for you.
you're leaving for Paris today. - No kidding?
with Sabrina. She's going to be on the boat.
Uh-huh? Does she have to be in here?
all right, Miss McCardle. You've got a lot of work to do.
aren't you pleased? What's the matter?
l saw Sabrina when she came home last night. Found her packing.
what did she say?
nothing. She just kissed me. - What's wrong with that?
l may know nothing about Dow Jones, but l know about kisses.
you could lecture on that at Vassar.
this one tasted like a goodbye kiss.
you're just imagining things. - No, it had a few tears in it.
lt took me until this morning to add two and two together, like two champagne glasses and the plastics deal and Sabrina.
you know what l got? - What?
sorry to do it to a tired businessman.
that's all right. Well, now we're even.
go home and start packing. l'll take care of Elizabeth.
l'm calling off the merger.
miss McCardle has your passport and ticket. Let her know if you need money.
l want you and Sabrina to have a good time in Paris. Goodbye.
what makes you so sure Sabrina still wants me?
she's wanted you all her life.
until you came along in that silly homburg.
straighten that silly hat and go. You'll miss the boat.
don't worry, l won't miss the boat. l'm going.
funniest thing.
linus Larrabee, the man who doesn't burn, scorch or melt, throws a $20 million deal out the window.
are you sure you don't want to go with her?
why should l want to go with her?
you're in love with her.
you won't be annoyed if l cry at the boat, will you, Sabrina?
l'll be disappointed if you don't, Father.
l'd feel better if you'd be angry with me for allowing this to happen.
lt wasn't your fault, Father. lt was mine.
l should have believed you.
there's a front seat and a back seat and a window in between.
lf it's any consolation, one good thing's come out of it.
you did get over David, didn't you?
dear David. Yes, l did get over that. l'm cured.
now, how to get over the cure!
lt wouldn't have worked out really.
the papers would have said how fine and democratic for a Larrabee to marry the chauffeur's daughter.
but would they praise the chauffeur's daughter? No.
democracy can be a wickedly unfair thing.
nobody poor was ever called democratic for marrying somebody rich.
why don't we start this meeting and sign the papers?
we're waiting for David, of course.
that boy has no sense of time, of direction.
as a matter of fact, he has no sense. Where is he?
we'll get to that in a minute.
here are the smelling salts. l got you the largest size.
look what l bought him for Waikiki Beach.
l hope they're loud enough.
l hope they're returnable.
l see no need for any further delay. Suppose we get down to business?
what about David?
that's a very good question. Not yet.
mr Tyson, members of the board... Are you with us, Father?
present.
we are here to put our signatures to the Larrabee-Tyson merger.
much effort has gone into making this union possible.
long hours. Many obstacles to overcome.
nobody knows better than l.
however... Not yet.
however, sometimes even the most conscientious of businessmen can botch up a deal for one reason or another.
understand, l don't mean to say that our merger has hit a snag, or failed to gel or gone up in smoke, or fallen through.
let me put it this way, gentlemen. lt has sailed away.
l seem to have missed something. Would you mind starting again?
now, Miss McCardle. Elizabeth, l hate to break the news, but at this very moment, your fianc, David Larrabee...
ls late, as usual.
Hello, everybody. Hello, darling. Hello, Linus. How are you?
what are you doing here?
l heard there was a board meeting. Where are the contracts?
Where's Sabrina? - Sabrina? Who's Sabrina?
that name! - She's on the boat, l guess.
but the boat has sailed.
and there she goes. - Who goes?
Sabrina. - Who is Sabrina?
why did you do it? - Do what?
she's all alone out there.
not according to the afternoon papers.
lt says here that Linus Larrabee, that's you, and Sabrina Fairchild, that's she, have reserved adjacent deck chairs on the Libert, sailing today.
all columnists should be beaten to a pulp and converted into paper.
did you plant this? - Me?
l thought it was common knowledge about you and Sabrina.
who is Sabrina?
our chauffeur's daughter, that's who. How about that?
linus Larrabee, wizard of finance, chairman of the board, getting mixed up with his chauffeur's daughter.
that's enough, David.
she went after me, but she switched to Linus.
l guess it's because he's got more money.
we know about those kind of girls.
believe me, this one is no different, just seems to be.
l said that's enough.
maybe you got smart, or maybe you just got lucky, because you're here and she's out there.
she would have taken you for plenty.
l was just helping you make up your mind.
you are in love with her!
what are you waiting for?
there's an elevator outside, a police escort downstairs and a tugboat standing by.
get moving!
lf you'll excuse me, it appears l have a previous engagement.
that's the 20th century for you. Automobiles. Garages.
chauffeurs. Chauffeurs' daughters!
lnasmuch as l seem to be the only member of the Larrabee family who is not out of his mind, l will take it upon myself to call this meeting back to order, as soon as David Larrabee removes his carcass from this table.
sit down, Father.
the olives!
miss Fairchild? ll y a un monsieur sur le bateau qui voudrait bien que vous lui arrangiez son chapeau.
voila. - Merci beaucoup.
you walk here?
alright, good. Turn around.
legs out.
the bag.
gotta still hit the farmers' market.
what time is it? - 10: 00-ish.
it's 10: 00? - Mm-hm.
I gotta pick up the kid. Where's Tony?
Tony and I were out late last night. But don't worry, he's gonna be here.
you got this? - Yes.
he's not gonna flake. Neither am I.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!
Yes, Chef. - Wake up.
we got a critic coming today.
why you think I slept here for, bro?
let's get going on the soup. We're behind on the egg prep.
and get the mise on the steak. You still shitfaced?
no, I'm good. I'm good, Chef. - Alright.
help Martin with the pig. We got the pig.
Lechon!
Hey, pal. - Hey.
buckle up, buddy. Sorry I'm late.
I'm used to it.
listen, pal, I don't think we have time to catch a movie today.
is it 'cause you're getting reviewed?
Yeah, how'd you know about that? - Mom told me.
What'd she say?
she said you might be a little worried.
she said I was worried? - Yeah.
well, Mom doesn't know me that well, OK?
she's pretty spot-on about you. - Oh, yeah?
you know what Mommy thinks I should be doing?
what? - That I should get a food truck.
I like food trucks. - Yeah, I like food trucks.
who doesn't like food trucks?
can you picture me driving a food truck? I'm a chef.
I work in a restaurant. - OK.
listen, I gotta go to the farmers' market, pick up some ingredients.
OK. Can I come?
I thought I'd drop you off at the restaurant.
Molly's there. - No, I wanna go with you.
you're not gonna ask me for everything you see? - No.
it's not about you eating, it's about me buying groceries.
I know. - OK. Good.
you got the purple and white? - Just orange.
just orange? Alright, give me six bunches of those.
or eight of the small. - Dad.
hang on a second, buddy. And on the radishes here, I use the tops, OK?
I need consistent tops. - Dad.
is that what's happening? Six of these. Let's see what we got.
dad. - What do you want, Percy?
can I please have kettle corn? - Daddy's working, OK?
no, you're not gonna get kettle...
why don't you get a piece of fruit? - I don't want fruit.
how can you even ask for kettle corn? You know what it is?
no. - It's carbs covered with sugar, OK?
look at this piece of fruit.
huh? It's beautiful.
how could you even want kettle corn with gorgeous fruit like this in front of you?
why don't you have a piece of fruit?
so apparently they're sending a big reviewer who's also some huge food blogger.
you know what a food blogger is? - Yeah.
a guy who writes about food on the internet.
I know what a food blogger is.
well, this guy's a big one, and a lot of these big guys, they don't like me.
they got it in for me because I got good write-ups when I started out.
they're haters. - Exactly.
we didn't have that word when I was growing up.
there was no word for hater.
the most you would say is that somebody was, like, jealous, which didn't really capture it.
the sausage guy's here. You ever try andouille sausage?
no. - It's spicy.
you like spicy? - No.
it's not so spicy. Come on.
that's from New Orleans. You ever heard of New Orleans?
Yeah. - Yeah?
it's part of the United States.
it's part of the Louisiana Purchase from Napoleon.
Yeah. Um, that was...
I mean, like, now. That was a long time ago.
1803. - Whatever.
talking about the food, the culture, you know?
like this andouille sausage.
beignets. You ever hear of that? - We can get it here.
not the same.
when you have it here, it's good because it reminds you of, like, a whole world of memories that you have of being there.
cause it's like... I'm telling you, it's like a whole different world.
we should go there sometime. - Definitely.
for real? - Yeah.
I mean, not now.
but, like... - When?
I don't know. I got... Everything's very full for me.
I got this reviewer coming. - After the review?
Yeah, after review. That'd be good.
I'm off school next month.
next month? Yeah. We could go next month.
awesome. - Or whatever. Or, like, if you're...
if it doesn't... I'll ask Mom.
if it doesn't work out next month, we'll go later.
but we'll definitely check it out. - I already did. She's cool with it.
you asked her already? - Mm-hm.
Where'd you get a phone? How come you have a phone already?
everybody your age have phones?
yo, Popeye, get the sauce on there, OK?
whose bacon is this, huh? I gotta watch this too?
when I find out who it is, grab your ankles, 'cause here comes papi chulo.
where we at? Talk to me, people. How we doing?
the stock's simmering, the pig's broken down, bacon are fine.
the stock is simmering. That means reducing.
good. Guys, big night tonight. You all know what's happening?
yeah? OK, let me know as soon as he's here.
I want people having fun at all the tables around.
call your pretty friends, bring 'em in. Tell 'em the tickets are on me.
the stemware looks crooked. Let's get out there.
don't make me get the fucking ruler out. Thank you.
Oh, Chef. - I got the good shit.
you see this, Martin? - Look at that. That's a specimen.
baby carrots. - I got you curry paste with...
copy that. Copy that. - Carl.
not right now, please.
where the fuck did you get these juicy-ass tomatoes?
Riva's here. - OK, you got it? Let's get...
what the hell's Riva doing here?
I don't know. He was on his way back here.
I got him espresso, bought you maybe five minutes of time.
you should meet him out on the floor.
stall him for five minutes. Let me get the staff going. Please.
OK. Fine. Expect him to come back here.
Yeah, thank you.
how you gonna keep that psychopath from coming back here?
you gotta have a plan. - You want me to pickle these?
Yeah, pickle these. I want you to pickle...
is Carl in there? - Yeah.
Hey, Carl!
Carl.
are you, uh... are you planning on altering the menu?
Yeah, I can't do this right now. Please, just...
you know a lot is on the line today. - I know.
that's why the menu has to be perfect.
give me five minutes with my staff, I'll walk you through the menu.
I've done this before. I can help guide you.
I don't need guidance right now. I need space.
OK?
thank you.
could we have a little privacy, uh, guys?
huh?
I ask you to leave, you gotta look at Carl?
OK, everybody, tomen cinco. Take five.
you good? - I got it. Go, go, go.
grab a coffee.
let's get something straight. - Yeah.
you don't fucking talk to my staff like that. I talk to my staff.
that side of the pass is you, this side is me.
that was the arrangement when you hired me.
OK, now will you listen to me for a minute?
Carl, I get ideas. Sometimes my ideas work.
I really don't care what magazine said that you're the next big thing.
the fact is, you work for me, in my restaurant, right?
I've had chefs before you in this kitchen.
I'll have chefs after you. OK? - Alright, good talk.
let me get back to work. - You know who's coming tonight.
we're being reviewed by the most important critic in the city.
Yes. I'm aware. - His online blog was sold to AOL...
for $10 million. - That's right.
you knew that? - Yes, I know.
OK. - He's a big deal.
that's why I wanna cook a good menu. - You wanna cook a good menu?
I wanna cook him some good food. - Yeah. Well, then...
and our place is in a fucking creative rut.
in a rut? - In a creative rut.
you do know we're doing better than any place in the neighbourhood?
I'm not talking about how much money we're making,
I'm talking about creatively... the food that we're serving.
we've served the same food for five years.
remember what happened when you put guts on the menu?
are you talking about my sweetbreads? Is that what you mean?
Yeah. When you put that artsy shit on the menu, people don't like it.
not one person ordered your sweetbreads.
please listen to me.
I sank a fortune into the remodel to get you the French cooking top, whatever it is, that tabletop.
french cooking suite. - Right.
not every chef gets that. You know why you get it?
I appreciate it. - Do you know why?
because you deserve it.
see, you don't know that. But I know it.
you deserve it.
so be smart just for tonight.
look, if you bought Stones tickets and Jagger didn't play 'Satisfaction', how would you feel?
would you be happy?
no. - No!
you'd burn the place to the fucking ground.
your menu works.
people love it.
Carl, do what you want tonight. OK? You're the chef.
you know what I think?
I think you should play your hits.
alright, let's go. Pre-shift, guys.
big night tonight.
here's what we're doing.
we're gonna go with the favourites.
starting with the caviar egg...
scallop, French onion soup...
frisée salad...
lobster risotto...
filet.
and we're gonna finish strong with a crowd pleaser, chocolate lava cake.
talk to Molly about wine pairings.
let me know when he gets here. And let's have fun.
put your heart in it, people, big night. Let's have some fun.
good, good.
# I'm so tired of being alone #
# I'm so tired of on-my-own #
# Won't you help me, girl, just as soon as you can? #
# People say that I've found a way #
# To make you say that you love me #
# Hey, baby, you didn't go for that #
# It's a natural fact #
# That I wanna come back #
# Show me where it's at #
# Baby, yeah #
# I'm so tired of being alone I'm so tired... #
dad.
dad.
dad! Come on. Let's go.
look! It's up, it's up. It's up, it's up. The review's up.
to the review. Here we go.
to you, baby, to you. - Here we go.
my culinary hero. - To the team.
Gauloises - eager to please.
Whoo! - Yes!
10 years ago, I had the good fortune to dine at Chef Casper's revelatory Miami bistro, Marrow.
Miami in the house! - Marrow, baby!
that's your house!
the sheer audacity of this fresh, brave voice of the culinary scene reminded me why I write about food as a vocation.
Yeah! - That's a lot of pressure.
it is nearly impossible to separate my glowing regard for Chef Casper and how much he inspired me from my expectations as I sat down to dine at the recently remodelled Brentwood Gallic staple, Gauloises.
Yeah, this is good! - Oh, how times have changed.
over the last decade, Carl Casper has somehow managed to transform himself from the edgiest chef in Miami to the needy aunt that gives you $5 every time you see her in hopes that you will like her, but instead causes you to shrink from her cloying embrace which threatens to smother you in her saggy, moist cleavage.
the signature app, intended to impress the country club brunch crowd, is the caviar egg.
a shirred egg topped with a dollop of caviar is an excuse for the chef to overcharge us for his insecurity and lack of imagination.
Carl Casper can best be summed up by the first bite of his needy and yet by some miracle also irrelevant chocolate lava cake.
Casper didn't even have the courage to undercook the cake, thus curiously lacking its signature molten centre.
this sad dessert is emblematic of Carl Casper's disappointing new chapter.
his dramatic... weight gain can only be explained by the fact that he must be eating all the food sent back to the kitchen.
two stars.
I don't get it. I don't get it.
everyone loved it. He loved it, even.
who cares? Who cares?
I do. 'Cause I could have done better.
I should have cooked the shit I was gonna cook.
you're ignoring the fact that everyone was happy and you're making a problem where there's no problem.
it's not hard to make people happy.
there's certain things you could put on a menu that'll make everybody happy.
if you put ahi tuna on a menu, it will sell out.
it's guaranteed. You know that.
but I cooked the beef cheek, which is a better dish, and nobody wants to even try it.
it was good, though. - Yeah, for family meal.
well, who you cooking for, though?
that's my point. Why do I have to pick?
why do I have to choose? Why can't I have both?
there are chefs that cook food that they believe in and people will try because they're open to a new experience and they'll end up liking it.
what do you want me to say to you? - The truth.
you want me to tell you that you're the best chef that I ever worked with.
and it's true, because you are.
you are, Carl. You are the best chef I've ever worked with.
OK. - I mean it.
well, thank you.
you're welcome.
we both agreed not to do that. - I know.
why don't I just cook you something?
Oh, OK. Fuck it. Let's go.
Mmm!
mom wants to talk to you.
Inez?
Inez.
are you OK?
I got two stars.
getting two stars is good, right?
I mean, I don't read that shit normally, but, you know, then he starts writing all this personal shit about me and...
how many people you got working? You got, like, 50 people.
and Percy's 10 years old. Does he still need a nanny?
he's in school all day. What does she even do here? Hi, Flora.
Hi, Mr. Carl. - I mean, what does he need...
what's she doing here? - You know that he's hurt, right?
because I was late? I already apologised to him. We're fine.
late? He waited for you for one hour alone outside.
well, I didn't realise it was that long.
it's just... that was the day that...
you're right.
I didn't like what they wrote about you.
I didn't like it either.
it hurt, alright?
you OK?
I'm alright.
good.
I'm gonna make it up to him.
that was fun, right? - Yeah.
where you going? - I gotta work on a menu.
it's still early. Can I watch?
Yeah, sorry, it's at work.
I won't get in the way. - Yeah, I gotta go work.
OK. Bye. - We'll have fun next week.
OK.
what the hell are you doing here, man? What's this madness, huh?
this is crazy. - Yeah.
you didn't go home, did you? - No.
come here. Check it out. - Go home, man.
you've been here all night. Go home. - Come here.
get some sleep. Fuck Twitter. Come on, get outta here.
"fuck Twitter"? What are you talking about, "Fuck Twitter"?
I mean, you know, fuck 'em. That's what I mean.
who reads that shit anyhow? - I'm not on Twitter.
I don't know what you're talking about.
nothing. Just classic bullshit. What is that?
that's carne asada. Check it out. - Wow.
Wow!
good? - It's fucking unbelievable, man.
is it? - Holy shit!
no, seriously. - No, I'm serious.
tell me the truth. - I'm telling you the truth.
it's incredible. - Is it good seasoning?
the seasoning's perfect. - Roll that shit!
chef Big Dog up all night cooking!
come on in, buddy. - Come here.
Tony, check this out. - Shut up and taste this.
come here. - What we got?
Wow. - It's good?
huh? Look at that.
too much heat? - That's perfect, Chef.
it's good? Seasoning? - Oh, it's perfect.
it's nice and spicy. - You like it?
Oh, man. - Ha, jefe? Look at that.
I do. - Yeah?
it's fucking great. - Is it good?
don't fuck with me. - But it's so good.
see, jefe? I told you. - It's flavourful as fuck, man.
it's nice, right? - Umm.
is it good? - Yo, Big Dog, fuck Twitter.
"fuck Twitter." Again with the "Fuck Twitter."
why should I fuck Twitter?
you're not on Twitter? - No.
you're getting too much pussy? Is that the problem?
it's gotta be, right?
what does Twitter have to do with pussy?
have you not heard of the term 'social networking'?
Yeah. - Well, that's what it is.
it means pussy? - Like, pussy.
or, like, getting tickets to something.
or finding about a new band. - Flash mobs. That kind of stuff.
anything that requires a database. - So pussy requires a database?
Yeah!
so show me what's on Twitter that's so bad that I should see.
Oh, shit, is that gochujang? - Nothing. Nothing.
damn, you made fucking gochujang? - Yeah, that's under the squab.
but he's gonna 86 it. Riva's gonna 86 it, I know.
yo, this gochujang is good. - Don't worry about fucking Riva.
he ain't gonna let you serve that Korean shit.
let me handle him. Don't worry about that. I got it.
he says I can cook whatever I want.
alright. Alright. - We're gonna cook like this.
did you try that? Oh, hey. - Oh, man.
that's broccoli rabe l'anchois. Check this out.
this is ridiculous.
what you got over there? - I got...
mom cuts off the crust. - Yeah, well, I don't.
it's good. - You bet your ass it's good.
can you turn that down, please?
Oh, sorry.
Arrgh!
you know about Twitter?
Yeah, I have an account. - Yeah?
how's it work? - It's cool.
it's cool? That's how it works, it's cool?
you tweet on it. - Is that like texting?
no.
sign me up. - OK.
so, what do you want your username to be?
Carl.
you can't just put Carl. It has to be at something'.
at Carl Casper.
@CarlCasper.
taken. - Someone took my name?
@ChefCarlCasper? Is that cool?
Yeah, that's good.
at... Chef...
Carl... Casper.
so is this for sex?
Eww! Is that what you're doing this for?
no, I'm not doing it for that. Someone wrote something bad.
I wanna see what they wrote.
good.
Oh, shit.
Hey. You can't talk like that.
I don't care if Mommy's not around. I don't want you cursing around here.
that review went viral. - What does that mean?
it means it got picked up and re-tweeted everywhere.
so all these people have read the review?
Yeah. - Oh, shit.
I think it's kinda cool. - I don't.
no, I mean, us doing this. - Doing what?
you know, just hanging out.
we hang out all the time.
no, like, hanging out and doing something.
well, we do things.
no, not just, like, watching something or doing something.
like, hanging out and talking.
and learning things from each other.
I figured, you know, with you living at Mom's house and me working all the time, when we hung out, you liked to do fun things.
I think this is kinda fun. You know, just figuring stuff out.
like when you lived at home.
Yeah, I miss that too.
then why don't you move back home?
Percy, I can't just...
you're not the reason that I'm not living at home. You know that, right?
Mm-hm. - 'Cause it's true.
then why? - Then why what?
well, why don't you live home?
well, Mommy and Daddy, you know, we... we both grew apart, in different directions.
but we're still really good friends.
it's just better if we don't live in the same house.
and that we're not married. - Oh.
you understand? - No.
it's hard to explain.
Hey, listen, could we twitter each other when we're not in the same place?
Yeah. - Could you show me how to do that?
Yeah. OK.
so, first you click here and you have to enter your username.
right. - You could also log in on your iPhone.
Uh-huh.
you click this button here, it posts your feed so all your followers can read it.
OK.
dad? - Yeah.
you got 1, 653 followers since last night.
Oh, is that good? - It's amazing.
Oh, good. What does it mean?
it means that 1, 653 people are reading your Twitter feed.
Mm-hm. I thought it was like texting.
did you post anything since last night?
no. - Are you sure?
Yeah, I just sent a private message to somebody.
to who? - To that A-hole food critic.
you could only send private messages to people who are following you.
I think you might have posted that publicly.
no, he wrote something nasty about me and then I hit reply and it let me send a message to him.
dad, replies are public. Everybody can read them.
and it looks like he re-tweeted it to all his 123, 845 followers.
and he wrote back.
what did he say?
I don't think I should read it. - Just...
can you read it to me, please?
@ChefCarlCasper...
I would rather have you sit on my face after a brisk walk on a warm day than suffer through that fucking lava cake again.
he wrote that to me?
he wrote it to everybody.
you gotta be kidding me. - Wow.
you realise how many people have read this?
I'm up to 2, 000 followers since last night.
you're trending, bro. - They're sending me messages.
they're goading me into responding to this prick.
don't do it. Don't do it, man. - Don't do that, Chef.
don't respond. Take the high road. - I know.
but half the people are saying he's right.
Yeah, but half the people are saying he's wrong.
that's the fucking internet. - That's right. Listen to him.
that's social media. You on Twitter? - Yeah, I'm Twitter.
what's your name? - Little Marty.
but all the people following me, I don't wanna hang out during the day.
I avoid all... Oh, hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
this guy. - Don't. What are you writing?
chef, don't... That's not a good idea.
just listen. I won't send it until we all say it's OK.
why don't you come by again tonight?
I got a whole new menu just for you, asshole.
no, gimme the phone. - That's not good. Not a good idea.
don't do it!
that's out there now, bro. - It happened.
why'd you do that? - You can't take that back.
you know what? I threw down the gauntlet.
so get ready for a fight.
I'm gonna go drop Percy off and come back and cook the menu we should've cooked last time.
so where are we going today? - I gotta drop you off, kid.
I gotta go shopping for tonight. I'm sorry.
can I come with you? - No, I'm sorry.
how come I'm, like, never allowed to be in the kitchen?
because it's hot and it's loud and there's a lot of bad language.
so? I hear bad language all the time.
where? - Online.
what kind of website could a 10-year-old get on that has bad language?
youtube. - YouTube has bad language?
could I at least come shopping with you?
no.
I got a lot to do and a lot on my mind.
look who's waiting for us. Hi, Mommy.
come here. I miss you. Give me a kiss.
Hi. - Hi.
so my publicist said that she can talk to you.
why don't you talk to her? - About what?
about Twitter? - Everybody's reading what you wrote.
I don't think you get it. - Get what?
let's call her. Go inside with me and we'll call her.
Yes, please, tell her to call me immediately.
I have Carl with me. I'm at home. Thank you.
alright, I'm gonna go. - No, no, she's gonna call right back.
she was on the other line. - You're making more of this than it is.
I just don't like to see you like this.
like what? I'm fine. I have to get to work.
you're never going to be happy cooking for someone else.
is this about the food truck? I don't wanna talk about it again.
why not? You can cook your own food. You can be your own boss.
I can book you for all the parties that I'm doing.
I appreciate the offer, but I don't need any charity from you or your ex-husband.
why are you being so proud? - Because I'm working.
and despite what you might think,
I have complete freedom to cook whatever I want now.
I like my life.
and as far as your publicist goes, when she calls back, you let her know that I understand I shouldn't tweet any pictures of my dick and any career advice should be kept to oneself.
OK? I'll see you later. Thank you.
I got all this shit in the trunk. - Want me to do this?
is it on? - Yeah. We're doing it.
we're doing it, guys. - Come on. Let's get everything out.
I want the Cambros, the delis out so we can start plating, OK?
Carl, can you tell me what's going on for tonight?
no, no, no, how many covers do we have tonight?
how many? We are overbooked. But I just printed out all the menus.
good. It's not the menu you got printed. It's different.
that's what I understand. - We're doing a tasting menu.
Carl, I have to put the wine... - A tasting menu for Ramsey Michel.
I know, but we... - He's coming. He knows about it.
did you see the "Eater" article? - I did.
I'm so excited for you. - It's all over the internet.
I love it so much when you're like this. - Taste the food.
bring in the waitstaff, have 'em taste the food.
make them understand what we're going for.
OK. - OK?
we're not pushing specials today. The whole menu is special.
I'm excited. - I'm excited. I'm finally happy.
I'm happy, OK?
am I allowed to be happy at work?
Carl. Carl. We're staying with the same menu, right?
I have something really good planned for tonight.
I'm gonna let you... It's not sweetbreads.
you're gonna be able to taste it. - That may be true.
but we have the most reservations on a work night since we opened.
you realise that? - I know. I was on Twitter.
Yeah. - I was promoting the restaurant.
I was on Twitter. - What? Yeah, that's another thing.
from now on, before you post anything online, I'm OK. Alright?
the whole reason everybody's here tonight is because I called out Ramsey Michel online and they're all coming to watch me stick it in his ass.
Yeah, and you're gonna twitter an apology for calling the most respected critic in Los Angeles an asshole.
I'm not gonna fucking apologise. - What do you mean, you're not...
you see what he wrote about me? - I don't give a fuck...
he started it! - What he wrote. I don't care.
you're a cook. You're a chef.
this is what you've been cooking for years, and it works.
and either you cook the menu that our customers have come to ex...
you want me to cook the same food? - The same exact...
the same food that he ripped apart? The same guy who's coming tonight?
the restaurant isn't filled with critics!
it's filled with people that've been eating your food for the last 10 years!
well, be an artist on your own time.
listen to me. - No sweetbreads!
listen! - No calves' brains.
I'm not cooking sweetbreads! Listen to me.
the kitchen is my domain. That was our deal.
I don't give a fuck what the deal was!
the deal is now changed. Either you stay or you go.
it's up to you. End of discussion.
we got a full house of people... who are coming tonight... - Yeah. Yeah.
to eat my food. - No, it's not your food, Carl.
it's not your food.
by definition, it's my food because it's my restaurant.
I pay for the glasses. I pay for the napkins.
I pay for the spoons. I pay for Molly's salary.
I pay for your entire staff's salary, OK?
so you either cook my menu or Tony can.
Tony, you've been cooking it half the time anyway.
tell the truth. Right?
so you're threatening to fire me now?
am I threatening to fire you?
no, I'm telling you what I'm prepared to do if you don't cook my menu.
subject closed.
well, why don't you cook the menu without a chef and we see how it goes tonight?
let's go, Tony. Fuck this.
Tony.
good luck.
Oh, no way. - Good luck, Jack.
no way, man! - Martin, Martin.
no. Hell, no. Come on. - You stay. Stay.
Martin, come on. Let me go, buddy. Don't do it.
don't do it. Just stay.
call me. Call me. - You'd better believe it, yeah.
Tony, you got a full house tonight. Be a pro, OK?
let's go! Get the leg on. Coming up.
get that lava cake out, table 22.
bring that shit back. Bring that shit back.
this is table 22.
just a moment, please.
no, no, we gotta chiz this. You didn't chiz it.
welcome back.
lovely to see you again, Mr Michel. Right this way.
thank you.
I hope traffic wasn't too bad. - No, it wasn't.
30, I got one. - Table 30's still missing the risotto.
what's going on with all these tickets, man?
yes? How can I help you?
isn't this, um...
wasn't this on the menu last time I... I... I visited?
I believe it was.
I was under the impression that tonight was gonna somehow be...
be different, more of an event.
I understand.
is there something we can do to make you more comfortable?
um... Could I actually...
could I speak with the chef? With Chef Casper?
I have a wonderful '09 that I just opened to let breathe.
um... - If I may?
the last time I was in Napa, at the vineyard, they shipped me this bottle as a gift, and I've just been waiting for the right occasion.
that... that's very generous of you.
is Chef Casper here?
unfortunately, he was called away.
is he coming back?
I'm afraid that was left ambiguous.
I need you out front. They're three deep in the bar. Get off the phone.
please let me do my job. - Please go to the bar.
Tony! - Carl, I can't talk right now.
we are in deep weeds. - This guy's tweeting me.
this guy's calling me out online. What the fuck are you serving?
I don't know. They're serving the same shit.
what's he eating? - I think he's...
what course is he on? - He's...
he's eating the chocolate lava cake right now.
you just keep him right where the fuck he is.
What?! - I'm parking the car.
Carl, what? - Don't let him leave.
keep the motherfucker there!
is he here? Is the fucker still here?
Oh, fuck. - Let's go into the back of the house.
I just wanna say one thing. I just wanna say one thing. Just one thing.
let's go to the kitchen.
stop it. Stop it for a second!
let's just...
I've been waiting to talk to this prick for a long time.
OK. - I am not cloying. I am not needy.
I don't care what you think.
you're not getting to me. I'm not needy!
chocolate lava cake is not just undercooked chocolate cake.
that's not what makes the centre molten.
you take a frozen cylinder of ganache and you set it in the ramekin so that as the outside cooks fully, the inside becomes molten!
OK. OK.
it's fucking molten, see? Its fucking molten, you asshole!
and you don't do anything. What do you do?
you sit and you eat and you vomit those words back.
to make people laugh.
you know how hard I work for this shit?
do you know how hard my whole staff works?
what sacrifices I make to make you happy and then you just smugly just fucking shit on my shit?
OK.
it hurts! - Yes.
it fucking hurts when you write that shit!
it hurt you. - It does. It does.
he was... He thought you were gonna close his fucking restaurant down!
you asshole!
and what do you? You just write shit to make...
you just make shit up! It was molten!
it's fucking molten!
asshole!
you're not getting to me! - OK, Carl.
he's not getting to me! - No, he's not.
I know, but you're a publicist. Don't you have relationships?
isn't that what you're hired to do? To take these things off the internet?
but it's out there.
even if I could persuade one site to pull down one clip, there are a dozen others from other cell phones.
what should we... should we at least lawyer up and threaten legal action or something?
you threatening them with lawyers builds on a story that's already getting a lot of play.
and then you get another week of headlines.
and then you got this food critic posting fresh blogs about you nonstop.
and they're all getting picked up, and the picked-up headlines are getting picked up by each other.
you know, it's absolutely unbelievable.
so... - I've never seen anything like...
wait a second... you're saying there's nothing I could do?
to get the footage down? No, that lives forever.
great. Awesome.
but there just might be an opportunity here.
how can this possibly be an opportunity?
well, I was holding off until we spoke, but I'm fairly certain we have a good shot at 'Hell's Kitchen'.
wait, what? - The reality show.
I don't think you understand what's going on here.
I'm a real chef with...
you said you needed money, right? - A job.
a job, not money. I need a job, like I had.
well, your Twitter account says you've got 20, 000 followers.
that's pretty damn big. - Yeah, I'm gonna cancel the account.
don't worry. - Don't cancel it!
I can get you money to mention a few products.
are you listening? I don't wanna get involved with any of that.
I wanna cook food. - You got two choices.
you can either lean into it and work it for all it's worth...
like Honey Boo Boo. I don't want that.
you know how much she pulls down? Or her mother?
I don't care what she makes. Get to your point.
or go underground and wait till the storm passes. You got two choices.
I thought this shit lives forever online.
it does, but there's so much news out there and it's so fast and there's so much white noise, nobody remembers anything.
OK, thank you for taking the time and walking me through everything.
it was very illuminating.
Oh, you're hanging up? OK, listen.
I want you to call any time. I'm right here.
if you can't get me, I'm on a cell phone and I've got a pager.
OK. Thank you, and thank Inez for me. - No, thank you.
and what about 'Hell's Kitchen'? - What about it?
you still want me to pursue it, right? - No, I don't want you to.
OK, I won't call 'em, but I'll email. - Are you not listening to...
I'm gonna go, OK? I got a call coming in.
OK. Alright. I'll tell you how 'Hell's Kitchen' goes.
fucking idiot.
Oh, man.
Hey, Inez. - Hi.
did you talk to Jen? - Yeah, I just got off with her.
And? - And, uh, you know, it's terrible.
what do you want me to tell you? I just wanna cook.
everything is going to work out.
half-a-dozen places tried to poach me when I was back at Gauloises.
I'm trying to line up some interviews for next week.
that's good.
Yeah, so, listen, until this whole job thing works out, could you keep Percy for me?
but you're still taking him with you to New Orleans, right?
is he there?
I'll tell him.
Ah, let me... let me talk to him.
put him on.
Hey, Dad. I understand if we can't go to New Orleans.
Oh, man, thank you so much for saying that.
just Daddy's so busy with work right now. You're the best.
maybe some other time.
Yes, we will, for sure. Thank you.
Bye.
Oh, Jefecito.
what's up, man? Look, everybody. Jefe's here.
come on, give me some drinks. Something premium.
Ketel One for the man.
Oh, dude. Oh, you're everywhere.
you saw it? - Ohh!
it's bad. How bad is it? - You saw it? You saw it?
I saw it. It's everywhere. - It's terrible.
is it bad? - You're never gonna work again.
I am, though.
no, seriously, there are people... there are people who are calling me.
dude. Oh, great. I'm glad to hear that. - Yes. Yes.
I knew you would have something bigger than this.
you don't care about coming back here. - Yeah.
so you came back to tell me you got me a gig?
cause I'll leave Gauloises like that, baby.
no. Trust me, the first phone call as soon as something becomes real.
don't leave me behind again. - I will not.
don't ever do that again. - Don't hit me.
this guy. - Please don't hit me. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry. I was on the spot, bro.
I had been drinking that day. I... I... I didn't know what to do.
I'm a pussy, basically. I'm sorry. - It's OK. It's over.
I vouch for that. - It's fine. What are you gonna do?
it's a big opport... - But then they put you on YouTube.
and I felt so responsible for that shit.
that shit was funny, by the way. - What was funny about it?
it's not funny for me. - Just that everybody I know saw it.
I know, I know. - I kinda felt famous by knowing you.
is it a little bit funny? Like... Like, is it... they're laughing at me or with me?
a little bit of both.
they're laughing with you and at you at the same time.
it's so embarrassing. - Oh, it is terrible. It is so bad.
but it's funny too at the same time.
it makes you kind of likeable in a weird way.
Yeah. That guy deserved it. Everybody knows that guy deserved it.
but, seriously, I'm sorry. - It's alright.
you know, I'm gonna land on my feet.
Oh, you will. - Yeah, good. I know.
I'll get my next gig. - I'll be there with you.
everything will be fine. - I'm your sous-chef now and forever.
you're not my sous-chef anymore. You are chef de cuisine.
but I wouldn't even be there... - It doesn't matter.
Riva's right about one thing.
it's a big opportunity for you.
to Tony's big new opportunity. - To Tony's big opportunity.
to chef de cuisine. - I don't like how it happened.
but I'm happy it happened. OK? - Two words, man.
you guys. I love you fucking guys.
I love you, Tony. I love you. - Thanks, Chef.
look at that. - Mmm.
I love both of you.
we love you, man.
let's have a three-way right here. Come on. Come on.
hang on a second. Hang on. Hang on. - I love you, man.
I'm glad you made up with him. - Thanks. Did you take the garbage out?
the truth of the matter is nobody's calling me.
I got no job prospects whatsoever.
what about those offers you got? - No. They got none. It's all dried up.
why, from the online shit? - It must be from the online thing.
come on. - I'm like... I'm like a fucking cat playing a piano.
I don't even know what that means.
I'm everywhere.
okay? Like, I'm, like... I'm, like, a meme.
know what a meme is? I'm a meme. I'm a fucking meme.
Carl, you need to take a break.
I've been on a break. I've had too much of a break.
no, you need a real break. - I need to work.
I need to get back to work in a kitchen. I don't care. - You don't... Carl Carl...
I wish I never would've op... I should've cooked the shit he wanted me to cook.
what? You gonna... You gonna go work for another Riva in some other restaurant?
you've been miserable here as long as I've known you, Carl.
that's not true. We've had a blast. - Yes, we've had a blast.
and now it's time for you to go.
you don't belong here anymore. You know it. Come on.
what's th... Who's this girl?
Carl. - What?
be real with me. - I am.
you've been ignoring a lot of things in your life that need your attention, like Percy.
I'm not dad material right now, if you hadn't noticed.
I'm embarrassing.
he sees all this shit on the computer.
well... - His friends have...
maybe it's important for you to talk to him about it, then.
I just... - He needs you, Carl.
I'm... I don't know him, Okay? He's at a weird age.
why don't you take this time to get to know him?
I want you to be happy.
you're not happy.
you're never gonna be happy here.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I've never not known what I was gonna do. I've always known.
there's always been the next thing to do.
and now that it's all ended, and I'm... I'm, like... I'm, like, fucking lost.
I think that's a good place to start.
come here.
you're the best. - Yeah.
I'll hold down the fort. I promise. - Okay. You do that.
thank you.
Hi, Flora. Percy here?
Percy aqui?
he's inside. - Can you tell him I'm here?
sure. - Thanks.
Hi. - Why are you here?
I'm here to see... here to see Percy.
Oh. - It's been a while.
I'm glad you're here, but why didn't you call to say that you were coming?
I don't know, because... - He said he's sleeping.
okay. I'm gonna go talk to him. - No, no, wait one second.
she said he says he's sleeping, but if he was sleeping, she'd just say he's sleeping, so he's not sleeping.
let me talk to him. - No. Wait. Can you talk to me for one second first?
please? Come.
Percy and I are going to Miami to see my father.
so why don't you come with us?
what? - Yeah, come with us.
you want me to go... I... I can't come with you to Miami.
I don't... I don't... I got all...
I don't... I don't have any money.
I need to wait for another job, for all this shit to blow over with the internet, Twitter, all that shit.
Yeah, but you know, I could lend you some money before you...
I don't want your money. I can't take charity from you.
you know that he's really upset because he couldn't go with you to New Orleans, right?
he's hurt. He misses you.
okay. What do you want me to do?
you know that the nannies can't get on the plane.
so why don't you come with us and you take care of him while I work?
so you need me to come with you to watch Percy?
Yeah. - So I'm the nanny?
Yes, his nanny, in Miami.
it might be good. That's where it all happened for you.
that's where Percy was born.
that's where you got your first job as a chef.
maybe it will just, like, clear your mind out.
you think Percy would be Okay with that?
Percy would love it.
Hm?
what do you say?
I have to run out for a quick meeting, so make sure when you go upstairs that everything is pressed, order him some food, make sure he takes a nap, a bath...
wait, wait, wait, a nap? - Get him ready for tonight.
I'm 10. - It's gonna be a long night.
we're gonna see Abuelito play.
where? At... At Hoy Como Ayer? - Mm-hm.
isn't he a little young for that? - Young for what?
he's not gonna perform forever.
he wants his grandson to see him play at least once.
alright, well, better keep an eye on him.
that place could get pretty crazy. - Me keep an eye?
that's why you're going too.
where are we? - This is Little Havana.
like in Grand Theft Auto? - No, this is where I grew up.
you did? - Yes.
and this is where Abuelito lives and works.
grandpa still works? What does he do?
I can't see.
eh, no, Papa. - What did he say?
no, he's asking if we're back together.
no, no, we're friends. I'm helping watch the baby.
wait, what's he... I don't understand.
maybe since last time, I understand, but, actually, recently, I'm down... I'm down 15 pounds.
20? - He's saying that he lost 20 pounds.
20. - I know... I know what he said. But I'm down...
that is in two months. I'm down... In... In two weeks, I've lost 15.
my suit doesn't even... doesn't even fit me anymore.
he's saying his pants might fall.
20 pounds. 20.
why does he have to say 20? I say 15, he says 20.
I could... Alright.
these are really good. We should wake up Percy so he can try one.
he say he knows. Let him sleep. It's too late.
no, but he's never had a real Cuban sandwich. I want him to try it.
he says you should make him one.
I... I want him to have a real one from here, from Little Havana.
Abuelo... Everything Okay?
this is really good, by the way.
yours are way better.
you think people would like this kind of food back home?
you think they would like it? - Yeah, it's real food. Why not?
maybe I'll talk to Marvin. - Mm-hm.
let me hear him out. You know.
see what he's got in mind for the food truck.
think he's in town?
I don't know, but, you know, I can find out tomorrow... I'll call him.
you know he's here. Is this the whole reason you brought me out?
I don't know what you're talking about.
try this. The yogurt's amazing.
I love yogurt.
you're full of shit.
Hi. I'm Carl Casper. I'm here to see Marvin.
booties? - Excuse me?
in case you don't want to remove your shoes.
thank you.
follow me, please.
Casper's here. - How ya doing?
glad you're here. Look at you. - How's it going?
come over here. Candy, come over here.
you're a sight for sore eyes.
wouldn't you want to eat something? I want to see you eat something.
alright? I'm worried. Eat some crackers or something.
Thanks.
look at you.
she's pregnant. Just found out.
the... This one?
pissed on a stick, came in, laid it on me five seconds ago.
is it... So it's yours?
I don't know. That's what she's saying.
you don't... - I know.
I got a problem, 'cause she's... best receptionist I've ever had.
Yeah. - Good news is I had my tubes tied in '08.
so, clearly, she's also a fucking liar.
right. That's tough. - What do you want?
you want a coconut water?
um... - You Okay?
I'm alright. I'm alright.
do you want a drink? - I would... No.
let's make some decisions together. Let's start right here.
alright, so... - Let's start off easy.
we got shit to talk about. Look, bang, you got four swatches, right?
let's start off easy and then we'll get into the uncomfortable stuff.
pick it. - The... For the...
for here? I don't know.
Yeah, I'm putting a carpet down, 'cause people keep slippin' around like it's a fuckin' ice rink in here.
you could always get 'em... take the booties off and, uh...
can't do that.
we'll go with, I don't know, this one?
you like that one? - I think...
if I had to... But if you're not gonna paint, I would...
this just seems like it goes with anything.
people aren't walking on the walls, Carl.
or I could keep it if I want.
the... - Keep the kid.
Yeah. - Knowing that it's not mine.
Yes. - You know, for once, I'm a good guy.
she stays on my desk and I fucking got something on her.
but you decide. What do you think?
are we... we're talking about the carpet now or are we talking about the, um... the...
we're talking about... - I don't even know anymore.
I think, um...
I'd go with the brown.
and as far as that goes, that's a personal... that's...
I don't know. - You're not a turd, Okay?
I don't want you to feel that way coming in here with your hat in your hand.
you went fucking crazy on the Internet. That was awesome.
you lost respect, which I love, 'cause it's passion.
you know, you lost everything.
you know, you're not a loser, but you have lost, Okay?
you're not a turd, a turd that lost.
I don't know that I feel like a turd.
good. - I feel like I had a bad week.
I feel like I lost my job. I made an ass of myself on the Internet.
I'm divorced. I'm old. I got no money.
I live in a shitty apartment in Venice.
but you know what makes me feel like a turd?
that I'm in my ex-wife's ex-husband's office and asking for a fucking favour and all he's doing is busting my balls.
I like this humility. It's good.
truth be told, food trucks are a great idea. You know what I mean?
I think we take it back to something simple.
let me see if I got something to say anymore. I don't even know.
it's no problem. - I'll pay you back.
as long as it's not weird for you... I don't want you to feel like because you were with Inez and you guys were sleeping together and I was with her and we had this...
I was with her, then you were with her, and then maybe I fucked her after.
I don't even know what happened with us.
I came out to LA for a Clippers game once and I think we had a couple of drinks and we went to Islands.
and I think she had... - What happened between you two?
I don't even... You know what? It doesn't matter. Here's what happened.
we're talking about a white-on-white '88 Chevy Grumman food truck.
it's a blank canvas for your dreams.
I'm gonna have 'em pull it around.
thank you.
don't thank me till you see it.
Yeah. I'm in Miami now.
none of the prospects panned out.
for real? - Yeah.
it sucks.
I guess you'll have to stay there for a while, bro.
Hey, Carl. Hey, papi, mira, I don't know if you heard or not, but um...
I got bumped up, man, to sous-chef.
sous-chef? - Yeah.
no shit! That's excellent!
congratulations, man. That's a big deal.
thank you, man. That means a lot coming from you, seriously.
Yeah, but enough about me. What... So, what are you gonna do?
you're gonna laugh.
I got a food truck. - Get the hell out!
no shit. You got a fucking taco truck?
Tony! Tony, Carl's got a fucking taco truck.
for real?
Jefe! Like with tacos and shit? - I just...
Yeah, I would assume. What are you gonna cook?
you know, Cuban sandwiches, plátanos, arroz con pollo.
simple shit like we used to do for family meal.
Oh, yeah, I remember those days, man.
fuck he doing with a taco truck? - Goddamn.
I'd love some of that shit now. - What's he doing with a taco truck?
it's good, right? It could be cool. - Yeah.
get the fuck off the phone, bro. Let's go!
alright, alright, alright! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.
Attila the Hun is calling me. I gotta go, man.
alright. Be good, man.
is this the new truck? - This is it. This is the truck.
Ahh! - It's got good bones.
it's gonna need a lot of work, though.
what doesn't?
wanna take a look around, champ?
do I have to? - Go!
go and look at your dad's new truck.
can I... uh... Can I ask you a question?
is something wrong?
did you sleep with him? - With who?
with Marvin. Did you sleep with Marvin?
but of course I did. He's my ex-husband.
I mean, since we were divorced. Have you slept...
who... Who did you sleep with last, him or me?
I'm sorry, but this is none of your business what I did...
I think it might be. - After I divorce you.
second of all, I don't ask you what you do with your hot ittle waitress.
that's completely different. - OK, really.
and that's not fair. - Yeah, yeah.
this is somebody you loved and shared a life with...
why do we have to talk about this right now?
because I took a business meeting with the guy.
this is not the moment. - It is. I wanna know why.
