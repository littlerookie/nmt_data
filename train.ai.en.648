van huis adds: "we're looking at ways of grinding the meat into some sort of patty, which would be more recognisable to western palates."

van huis told me that purified insect protein is "the ultimate possibility," but that isolating it remains difficult.
van huis's ideas are not unique: scientists have made similar proposals since the 1970s, when fears of global famine surged.
van huis's latest research, conducted with colleague dennis oonincx, shows that farming insects produces far less greenhouse gas than livestock.

van nistelrooy trained with the rest of his united team-mates at carrington on thursday morning, as rumours that he had already jetted off to madrid for talks over a possible transfer proved unfounded.
van nistelrooy's advisers say they are bewildered by ferguson's rather vague comments about a "couple of incidents in training" damaging team spirit.
van nistelrooy's spell on the bench is part of modern football's need for squad rotation.
van nistelrooy, having flirted with the idea of leaving united several times in recent years, is certain to mull over the matter as he spends this week on international duty with holland, doubtless aware that clubs in italy and spain continue to covet him.
