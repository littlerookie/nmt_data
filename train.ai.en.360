what we -
what we Spartans call a beautiful death.
what we accomplished and achieved here.
what we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.
what we acquire along with our first wrinkle
what we acquire along with our first wrinkle
what we acquire without sweat we give away without regret.
what we actually think is happening here.
what we actually use are two radio telescopes,
what we affectionately refer to as the blood poop -
what we agreed? Your partner called me.
what we all called you behind your back.
what we all do, be a wheelwright.
what we all have in common.
what we all knew when we first auditioned you.
what we all mean to each other and, of course, your mother and me...
what we all need is a manual on how to worry intelligently.
what we all need now is proof that the Coon exists.
what we all need right now
what we all need to do is provide reasons that have some purchase for other people in their capacity as fellow citizens, whatever their world-views.
what we all said about politicians is certainly unrepeatable.
what we all want to know - who killed Laura hunt.
what we all want, really. You know?
what we already knew it was, right?
what we already know about gravity, how it works...
what we already paid for.
what we also know for a long time. You killed Sarah delporte.
what we also know is that a somnolent and acquiescent board has been shocked into a state of alertness that might even rival that of rupert's wife.
what we always do.
what we are about to attempt has never been done before.
what we are and what I am. And now she's heading back to the carcass.
what we are asking of you this evening is......
what we are concerned with here is how you can realize this truth-that is, make it real in your own experience.
what we are confronted with is, in my opinion, nothing less than a sharp risk of dismantling, or at least damaging the global economic machine at the risk of deglobalisation.
what we are dealing with here is a perfect engine.
what we are discussing here, and what is my job,
what we are doing here is fighting for wrestle rettes, which I founded.
what we are doing here,
what we are doing now...
what we are doing today is more than donating some money.
what we are effectively saying is, don't buy this Porsche, buy a stamp.
what we are facing here, is a product of intellect, it was assembled by those
what we are feeling by touching, is perhaps a feather on the universe, or even smaller.
what we are going to achieve together.
what we are going to be doing
what we are going to be facing is going to fundamentally alter
what we are going to do is give much more leeway and flexibility at the corporate level. "
what we are going to explain now is nothing more and nothing less than why the so-called paradox of saving is entirely wrong from the standpoint of economic theory (hayek 1975, pp. 199263).
what we are going to shoot.
what we are gonna do
what we are gonna do that little brat gets here?
what we are instead of what we were a nanosecond ago,
what we are is required to follow orders.
what we are is trouble for the other groups.
what we are living for?
what we are living through now is the end of 500 years of western predominance. This time the eastern challenger is for real, both economically and geopolitically.
what we are looking at here,
what we are looking at is definitely -
what we are looking for here is.
what we are looking for is support
what we are never changes. Who we are never stops changing.
what we are not going to have are__6__deadlines, we are not going to have__7__on the generals on the ground, in a bill, the president is not going to signs such a bill.
what we are offering you is to participate
what we are offering you is to participate
what we are offering you, the government,
what we are planning is cutting-edge technology never seen in Australia before.
what we are seeing is a broad transformation of the world, with many countries succeeding in achieving modernity.
what we are seeing is a candle flame.
what we are seeing is pure apathy.
what we are seeing is the village near luxor, which is characterized by the typical houses built with mud and straw.
what we are seeing represents the third major rally in global grain and oilseed prices in just half a decade.
what we are seeing today, therefore, is a gradual renationalization of european foreign policy, fueled in part by incompatible economic preferences and in part by recurring fears that local (i.e., national) identities are being threatened.
what we are seeing, in short, is an epidemic of private sector frugality-just as many economic doctors recommended.
what we are seeking, after all, is not simply an agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
what we are seeking, is a prelude to majority rule.
what we are selling is confidence, a better you.
what we are sure of, and what's most important for
what we are talking about is the strategic, and not the tactical, counter-offensive.
what we are talking about would have been a historic change.
what we are to each other.
what we are to mission control,
what we are trying to answer is, should they become schizophrenic,
what we are trying to do is that knowing
what we are urgent needed is matrial.
what we are voicing is the desires of the people.
what we are waiting to comprehend is the heart of light.
what we are witnessing as a result is chaotic fluctuations of all kinds--economic, political, sociocultural.
what we are witnessing in this country is the spread of yob culture.
what we are witnessing is a passing of the torch from one group of thinkers, the traditional literary intellectuals, to a new group, the intellectuals of the emerging third culture.
