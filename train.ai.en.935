every house in the neighborhood.
every move anyone ever made was being watched.
Skynet work camp.
this is how they were set up.
people working for the machines
monitored by other people working for the machines.
who are you people?
I need to know what they were building in that plant.
I need to know who owned it, and I need to know right now.
I-I don't-- how would I know?
because the tunnel led to your garage, that's how.
my husband's garage.
look, we don't know you people.
for all we know, you could be responsible for this.
you could be some terrorist organization.
we are some kind of terrorist organization.
and believe me, if someone hadn't blown up that plant,
I would.
now, where's your husband?
he's dead.
no, he's not dead...
yet.
wait, wait.
please, he's innocent.
he is. John, you have to believe me.
no, I don't have to.
I was with him when he got the news
that everyone was dead, he was freaked out.
and he was trying to figure out what to do,
and he didn't know what to do.
he was scared, like we all are.
what were they building at the plant?
I don't-- nobody knows.
how can you not know?
how can any of you not know?
how can you just sleepwalk through your lives?
just tell us what they were building at the plant.
just stop it!
he told us he was gonna play dead!
he told us everybody else had died, that he should've died,
and that it would be better
if that's what everybody thought!
that is what he said!
now, you think I'm sad,
that I am pathetic, that I what
that I just sleepwalked my way through all of this.
well, maybe you're right. Maybe I looked the other way.
well, we all did, every one of us.
and maybe that's not what you think you would do,
but that is what most people do.
mom, you don't owe them this.
so there's not plant now, no plant, no charm acres.
but it is a lot of insurance money,
enough for my family to get lost and start over.
so I didn't ask any questions.
why would I start now when we are so close?
look at this.
I pulled this from the archives.
Mike?
daddy?
you may not like asking questions,
but me, once I get started, I can't stop.
mom.
I think I know where he might be.
excuse me.
I've been watching you. You want to know what I see?
what do you see, Diana?
ed would say you don't smell right.
well, I guess Ed would know.
look, I deserve the truth.
I opened up to you.
sometimes it's better not to ask too many questions.
you're crying.
no.
Yes, you are.
come here. I want to tell you something.
I remember when my father died.
he was a tough man.
we didn't get along.
even so...
it took me a long time to come to terms with his passing.
do you understand what I'm saying?
I miss daddy.
what do you miss about him?
he used to read me stories.
I can read you a story.
he did it better.
you know...
anytime you want to see your father, we have videos.
it's not the same.
Why?
I can't sit on his lap.
come,
sit on my lap.
your lap is cold.
I know.
where are we, John?
what is this place?
I don't know.
make sure you get to the safe house before night.
the safe house is in the desert?
Hey, desert's that way.
we're taking a detour.
who lives here? Charley.
John Henry was infiltrated.
someone out there wants to kill him.
I don't know which one is his.
doesn't matter.
grass, trees.
could be worse.
could.
it's been 25 years.
desert.
you said meet us in the desert.
I did.
funny thing about the desert, you don't find many lighthouses there.
we stopped to see Charley.
so you did.
Charley's dead.
so I heard.
from who? - John.
he called you too.
good thing.
might not have found you.
my brother buried out there, I thought...
that counted for something between us.
well, John counts for more.
and you keep too many secrets for my taste.
sorry about Charley.
well, everybody dies for me, right?
John...
I found this on the body at the lighthouse.
who is it?
I don't know, but I've seen her.
where?
Dr. Sherman's office.
the shrink from the list?
I think she was a patient there.
probably the one we were looking for.
these people, they tried to kill us.
they have a picture of this girl.
it means something.
we all know where we're going, so let's just go.
all right, everyone.
go to your Learn-A-Word program.
I'm gonna give you ten new words.
you'll put them in the search box.
and then...
Savannah?
maybe you'd like to tell the class what's so funny?
nothing.
that doesn't look like Learn-A-Word.
I'm just chatting.
with who?
my friend.
who's your friend?
she said his name was John Henry.
John Henry?
I'm sure it's made up.
these types of predators often use pseudonyms.
I see.
grown man contacting a girl this age...
I probably don't have to tell you, Ms. Weaver, that there are some troubled people out there.
Yes, there are.
and some of them look perfectly normal.
Yes, they do.
well, I hate to think what can happen if he finds out where she lives.
I appreciate you bringing this to my attention.
I'll talk to her.
why were you talking to John Henry during class?
I was teaching him the words to a song.
what song?
the one daddy used to sing.
I want John Henry to sing it with me.
maybe I could sing it with you.
you're not a boy, and you can't sing.
fine.
we won't sing.
but what you do have to do is pay attention to the teacher.
she said bad things about John Henry.
what did she say?
she said if you talk to somebody on the computer,
the could come to your house and hurt you.
John Henry would never hurt you.
but there are some people who wouldn't understand him.
and people are afraid of things they don't understand.
if they knew him, they'd like him.
that may be, but for now,
I don't want you to talk to anyone about him.
is that clear?
Okay...I won't.
I'll see you tonight.
what are you looking at?
myself.
Why?
do you have a brother, Mr. Ellison?
Yes...In Atlanta.
does he look like you?
people seem to think so.
do you think my brother looks like me?
John Henry, wherever your brother might be, he's a...computer.
he doesn't look like anyone.
he certainly doesn't have your face.
I know that, Mr. Ellison.
I simply meant, I wonder how similar his data is to my data.
I wonder if we share the same thoughts.
I have no idea, but...
I imagine you're unique.
Yes, I am unique.
but we may still reach many of the same conclusions,
given similar data sets.
you may think alike.
I'd like to know if we do.
the human brain is an amazing computer.
its raw clock speed is 20 billion calculations per seconds.
its storage is functionally infinite.
but it's flawed.
how is that?
there's nowhere to download it when you die.
not exactly, no.
your bible solves this problem by introducing the concept of heaven.
Yes.
billions of souls with no bodies.
okay.
yet all this is required simply to
process the unique entity you call John Henry.
Yes.
it's possible heaven has a hardware problem.
it's not that simple.
I need to know what my brother is thinking, Mr. Ellison.
I need to know what he plans to do.
I don't wanna die again.
do you think you can be a little angel
while I do 25 minutes of turbo body crunches?
I still have math. I'm adding.
great.
hello. I can't talk right now.
why not?
I'm doing my homework.
but I have an idea.
you can come over and do math with me.
I have to go.
I can't hold the phone and write my numbers.
use the headset.
you can talk and work simultaneously.
Si...
simul...
simultaneously.
it means to occur at the same time.
coterminous.
Oh!
John Henry...
Hello, Savannah.
what does coterminous mean?
Hello?
John Henry?
Hello?
John Henry?
hi
Savannah, listen to my voice.
I'm scared.
do as I say, and you will not be harmed.
but you'll have to finish your homework later.
Hello, Mrs. Weaver?
this is RNE security.
we detect an unauthorized entrance at your front gate.
do you require assistance?
Mrs. Weaver, we're sending a unit to your home.
now come out of there.
I don't want to.
don't worry. I can tell you where to go.
who's that man?
the water delivery man.
where is Debbie?
Debbie's in the foyer. We're not going that way.
go to the garage.
where do I go now?
John Henry?
John Henry?
no no! It's okay. It's okay.
come on.
okay, go, go, go, go, go!
come on.
Uhh! Come here, come here.
it's okay. Come on.
keep moving.
keep moving.
detective Crayton.
LAPD.
James Ellison, head of security.
I know who you are, Mr. Ellison.
what happened?
there was an attack on the residence about an hour ago.
alarm went off, security arrived, found the nanny dead.
it was pretty ugly firefight.
four security guards killed, plus one of the gunmen.
daughter missing.
any idea on the gunman?
no ID.
we're waiting for ballistics, coroner's report.
anyone call with demands?
no. There's an amber alert out.
we've set up a command post from the lobby here.
officers posted throughout the building.
I'm putting 24-hour protection on Ms. Weaver.
how are you holding up?
the detective wants to speak with Savannah's friends.
I made a list.
I'm concerned I may have left someone off.
if you can think of anyone else Savannah spends time with...
I'll take a look.
excuse me.
thank you.
Mr. Ellison...
when I said I knew who you were, I didn't mean anything bad by that.
you know, things are rough when "I know you" can be taken as an insult.
anyway, no offense.
none taken.
so how do you like the private sector?
I get a better car.
nice.
anything you can tell me... about Weaver?
not much to tell.
husband died a couple years ago.
she didn't talk about that much?
she doesn't talk about much much.
what's her relationship with her daughter like?
they seem close.
have any enemies?
not that I know of.
I hate these cases.
we'll find her.
why did you stop looking for Sarah Connor?
well, she, um...
she died eight years ago.
no, that's not true.
so you accept she's alive?
Sarah Connor was at the house?
alive.
obviously, yes. Did she take Savannah?
so it doesn't surprise you she's alive.
no, it doesn't surprise me.
you lied about what you know.
did she take Savannah?
I tried to help, but could not.
did Sarah Connor kill those guards?
no.
then who was she shooting at?
him.
we should tell Ms. Weaver.
no.
I don't think we should tell anyone.
Mr. Ellison...
you're asking me to keep a secret.
you tell me it's wrong to lie, yet you keep doing it.
I know what I said, John Henry.
but in this case, a lie might save someone.
how?
our best chance to get Savannah back is for me to handle this.
quietly.
you understand?
is Sarah Connor going to hurt Savannah?
no.
would she harm me?
why do you ask that?
she blew up Cyberdyne.
she killed Miles Dyson.
his work is in my code.
right now, the most important thing is to find Savannah.
who is she?
She's...like me, isn't she?
Yes.
if I keep your secret, will you bring Savannah back?
I'll do everything in my power.
so will I.
Sarah Connor.
this is James Ellison.
how'd you get this number?
a friend found it for me.
do you have her?
just tell me if she's safe.
I need her back.
Weaver's house is wired.
I've seen the surveillance tapes.
right now, I'm the only one that has.
let's keep it that way.
I can't, not yet.
it's a long story.
tell it to me.
downtown, third street tunnel.
one hour.
what are you doing here?
taking you to Sarah Connor.
the plan was to meet at the tunnel.
the plan changed.
you'll take a left.
I'm gonna need your gun.
I don't carry one anymore.
you lied to me once before. I should have killed you then.
drive!
Where's Savannah?
what's your deal with Zeira Corp?
I work there.
what were you doing at the Weaver house?
why'd you take the girl?
to protect her. - From who?
one of them.
a machine was there at the house.
what would they want with a six-year-old girl?
who knows with these things?
they may want her mother. - Why?
the girl was seeing Dr. Boyd Sherman.
he worked at Zeira Corp.
died at Zeira Corp.
that was an accident.
the girl's in danger. Her mother's in danger.
you are in danger.
get me the girl back. I'll handle it.
listen to me. Derek's dead.
Charley's dead.
Charley?
eight years ago, you would have thought I was crazy.
thrown me back in Pescadero.
but you've seen them. You know it's true.
they're very good at what they do, and not going to stop.
now, let me talk to Weaver.
let me have Savannah.
she's not safe with you.
I'm gonna have a hard time explaining that.
then let me explain it...
to her.
I told you to stay out of this.
I tried.
everywhere I turn, there you are.
the security footage from the house...
I need to see it.
I can't access it right now.
why not?
the files were corrupted.
a faulty sector on one of the drives.
I'm working to repair it.
Savannah's safe.
you didn't bring her back.
not yet. I'm working on it.
we need to talk.
Hey, you remember me, right?
the squirrel runs around the tree.
dives in the hole, scurries up the other side.
that's right.
you taught me how to tie my shoes.
I did.
at Dr. Sherman's.
he died.
I know.
I liked him.
me too.
he was my friend.
that man that got hurt at my house, was he your friend?
Yeah, he was.
I'm sorry.
me too.
it's all my fault.
that is not true.
the teacher told me... mommy told me too... not to talk to John Henry.
that if I did, bad people will come to our house and hurt us.
who's John Henry?
he's my friend... at my mommy's work.
what does he do there?
he lives in the basement.
he lives there?
my mommy says people won't understand.
Oh. Well, I understand.
I had an imaginary friend too when I was your age.
he's real.
he talks.
I'm teaching him how to sing.
well, why does he live in the basement then?
he can't leave.
there's a cord in the back of his head.
a cord?
in the back of his head.
do other people talk to John Henry?
Mr. Ellison.
Mr. Ellison?
he works for my mommy.
he teaches John Henry stuff.
what kind of stuff?
Sarah Connor's alive?
and she wants to meet you.
she took my daughter. - To protect her.
from a machine.
it might be after you.
how do you know?
I saw the security tapes.
you did?
John Henry, I suppose.
I asked John Henry to hide them.
from me?
from everyone.
including you.
I can't say that pleases me.
I think you should do what she asks.
you should go meet her.
I'm staying here.
Why?
someone needs to protect John Jenry.
John Henry? This is your daughter.
there's a machine out there looking for her.
you need to protect her.
I'm sorry. - You should be.
what you need to understand, Mr. Ellison...
what I believe you're beginning to understand...
is that when my behavior implies that
I value John Henry's survival more than
that of my own daughter,
it is not because I value John Henry more than Savannah.
it's because I believe Savannah's survival
may someday depend upon John Henry's survival.
and because I believe that your survival
may someday depend upon John Henry's survival.
I'll meet with Sarah Connor.
make it happen.
ballistics came in on the John Doe.
funny thing is,
the bullet that killed him didn't come from the security guards.
strange.
turns out he's a fugitive.
ex-con.
escaped custody on a felony murder charge.
that's the other funny thing.
it was your case.
andrew Goode murder.
Mm-hmm. You interrogated him?
Yes, I did.
hours before he escaped?
that's right.
guilty?
I never had a chance to prove it.
because he escaped.
only to turn up months later at the home of...your employer.
I know what you think.
I know why you're thinking it.
I would think the same thing if I were in your shoes.
I'm not thinking anything yet, Mr. Ellison.
I'm just collecting information.
how's the girl?
she's fine.
she was, uh, just telling me about her friend, John Henry.
the man with the cord in the back of his
head in the basement of her mother's work.
plugged into a big computer.
and this is him.
Oh, it gets better.
she says that Mr. Ellison has been teaching it things.
I destroyed that chip.
you destroyed "a" chip.
I don't think it's Cromartie.
I think it's something else.
something bigger. Something worse.
it's Cyberdyne all over again.
why do they need the body?
the technology can be reverse engineered and used as a platform.
Yeah, I know all that.
but they're not using it for the parts.
They're...playing with it.
I should have killed him.
I'm going to kill him.
you're not going to kill him.
he can't be trusted.
no one can be trusted.
but I only wanna kill him.
no one's going to be killed.
no one's going to be killed.
yes?
Catherine Weaver has agreed to meet.
great. When? Where?
you give me the girl, the police go home.
when it's clear, I'll bring you in.
the girl can't stay there. It's not safe.
that's for her mother to decide.
done.
we don't kill just to kill.
I never have.
look at these specise
they stay in hiding, mostly.
and only attack when provoked.
what does it eat?
cuttlefish.
crustaceans.
other eels.
please don't tap the glass.
how long has Mr. Ellison worked for you?
a few months.
you ever ask yourself why he didn't stay with the F.B.I?
no, I don't.
are you aware he was arrested?
murder.
he was cleared of those charges.
did the two of you argue lately?
had any tension?
any reason he might want to harm you and your family?
detective...
are you suggesting Mr.
ellison may be complicit in the disappearance of my daughter?
it wouldn't be the first time we've
seen an employee try to blackmail their boss.
well, it would be the first time I had.
this thing...
it eats other eels, huh?
that's interesting.
when you told me the security tapes were corrupted,
you were lying to me for Mr. Ellison.
and I'm lying to him for you.
what would happen if he knew?
knew what?
that you aren't Savannah's mother?
that you aren't anyone's mother.
are you threatening me, John Henry?
I could tell Mr. Ellison.
you could...but that would be unfortunate.
mostly for Mr. Ellison.
I find him useful, but not efficient.
what if he fails?
then we won't see Savannah again.
Mr. Ellison taught me...
that human life is sacred.
Sacred...that's an interesting word.
comes from the Latin, sacrum, much like another word... sacrifice.
sacrifice.
perhaps it's necessary to sacrifice Savannah for the greater good.
the greater good is keeping you safe.
in the elevator, you told Mr. Ellison...
that Savannah's survival depended upon my survival.
Yes, I did.
but you didn't say...
that my survival depended upon hers.
it doesn't.
ms. Weaver...
yes?
there is a bible story of two brothers, Cain and Abel.
God favored Abel.
Cain killed him.
God cursed Cain and ordered him to wander the world alone.
I'm familiar with the story.
which brother am I?
I don't know, John Henry.
perhaps you're neither.
perhaps, in this story, you are god.
I wanna tell you something.
yes?
it was not my idea to ditch you and Derek.
I thought we were gonna meet you in the desert.
and my mom took this detour off to Charley's.
I thought you knew.
she had her reasons.
she was pretty damn pissed at Derek about the whole Jesse thing.
who wasn't?
I guess none of that matters now.
you'll miss him.
well...
there's no use crying about it...
is there?
I'm sure future me would beat my ass if I did.
future you knows what it means to lose people you love.
it happens to him too.
your mother ditched us because she was going to ditch you.
she was going to leave you with Charley.
no.
no, that's...that's insane.
she found a lump in her breast.
Yeah, the transmitter, I know.
she thought it was cancer.
well, she had a lump. It makes sense.
she's lost weight.
what?
get her up.
we've gotta go.
think he'll come?
he'll come.
he could be deceiving us.
he's done it before.
he wants the girl.
he'll be here.
and what if he doesn't come through... with the meeting with Weaver?
we're going into Zeira Corp with or without him.
when we're done, it'll be ashes.
she's wrecking the town looking for you.
come on, I gotta get you out of here.
No!
take me out there, she'll kill me!
she's crazy!
come on, Mr. Archer, we gotta get out of here!
you alone?
Yes. Where's Savannah?
row "J.
I'll be in touch about the meeting.
put your hands behind your head.
kneel on the ground.
John, I swear I didn't know.
I'll kill you!
let go of me! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you.
I just got down from the Isle of Sky
I'm not very big, but I'm awful shy
the lassies shout as I walk by
Donald, where's your trousers
let the wind blow high, let the wind blow low
through the streets in my kilt I'll go
all the lassies cry hello
Donald, where's your trousers
I went to a fancy ball
it was slippery in the hall
I was a-feared that I may fall 'cause I nay had on trousers
let the wind blow high, let the wind blow low
through the streets in my kilt I'll go
all the lassies cry hello
Donald, where's your trousers
the lassies love me, every one
but they must catch me if they can
you canna put the breeks on a highland man
sayin', Donald, where's your trousers
let the wind blow high
let the wind blow low
through the streets in my kilt I'll go
all the lassies cry hello
Donald, where's your trousers
I went down to London town
to have a little fun in the underground

in the future, my son will lead mankind in a war against skynet, a computer system programmed to destroy the world.
it has senmachines back through time...
some to kill him...
one to protect him.
today we fight to stop skynet from ever being created to change our future.
to change his fate.
the war to save mankind begins now.
where are we?
same where. Different when.
I want my new name, my all-new me.
I'll track down Enrique.
I need three sets of papers.
my nephew has taken over the business.
you're in the system and everything.
uncle Enrique will be proud.
he referred to you as a rata -- a snitch.
why would you do this?
because you wouldn't.
why not stay in the past?
you died.
two years ago--cancer.
I've seen that before.
Skynet work camp.
resistance fighters.
you sure there's money here.
anything they valued, money, guns-- it'll be hidden.
you told me we'd be safe.
Skynet doesn't know you're here.
there's no directive to hunt you.
what if they found it, but they don't know what to do with it?
who the hell are you, man?
they do.
when I was in the mental hospital, I became obsessed with science.
not all science, actually.
and not really science at all.
Scientists--and then only nuclear scientists.
the ones who invented the bomb.
oppenheimer, Heisenberg, Fermi, and Teller.
pioneers, geniuses all.
I read every book I could.
I wanted why couldn't they stop, these fathers of our destruction?
and why wouldn't anybody stop them?
and if I had the chance, would I?
morning.
you look like hell. - Up late.
newspaper clippings...
surveillance photos, bank records.
pamphlets from every high-tech company in the state.
I even thought I saw the deeds to city hall in here somewhere.
those resistance guys weren't sent back here to be our support crew.
they're a skynet hunting party.
Really? Are you--you sure?
most of this is still a puzzle to me, but there is one list in here I understand.
employee list, Cyberdyne systems.
seems they thought it was a good place to start.
and it is.
she's not gonna be happy to see you.
she never is.
want me to come along?
no. You have your own job to do. A big one.
you're getting pretty good at that.
thank you.
still, it's not exactly brain surgery or anything.
be pretty funny if you were some sort of advanced cybernetic intelligence, yet stumped by a stick of eyeliner.
no, it's not brain surgery.
it would have to be a lot sharper for brain surgery.
much better.
when you wear clothes-- much better.
okay, six ways in.
six ways out.
the front opens to the street here.
security's minimal.
two armed guards in the morning.
four in the afternoon.
and if anything goes wrong, there's a parking lot here.
mom, it's high school, okay? Not Supermax.
we can handle it.
we can handle it.
don't you kiss me.
or anyone else.
okay, now blend in.
blend in.
Yeah, I mean don't seem like a freak.
you know what I mean, right?
freak. Weirdo. Kook. Oddball. Crackpot.
strange duck. Queer potato. Nut.
I've been reading the dictionary.
I don't sleep.
Yeah, see, that's what I'm talking about.
you do that, you sound like a freak.
and don't walk around acting like my bodyguard.
you're supposed to be my sister.
you won't fool anyone.
I fooled you.
what's that all about?
appears to be a reimagining of a trompe l'oeil fresco.
I don't sleep.
cell phones, hats, rings, and bling, take it off and put it in the basket.
cell phones, hats, rings, and bling in the basket.
in the basket, people. Come on.
the line keeps moving. Let's go.
cell phones, hats, rings, and bling. In the basket.
please, keep the line moving. Thank you.
cell phones, caps, rings, and bling.
in the basket, please. Let's go. Come on. Thank you.
cell phones, caps, rings, and
again with you, missy.
cell phones, hats, rings, and bling in the basket. Hold that. Come through.
excuse me. This is my sister.
extra credit for you.
look, she's got a metal plate in her head.
really. I-it's a big one.
I fell. Hard.
all right, let's go.
cell phones, caps, rings, and bling.
I thought you were dead.
well, I'm not.
lucky you. You look
different? - The same.
well, I can't explain.
I wouldn't want you to.
is john- - he's good.
about that machine?
she's still around.
not that one.
the other. - No.
do you mind?
you brought it.
Danny's not here?
it's ten years, right?
he's at school.
he hasn't come in a long time.
I'm sorry to hear that.
what do you want, Sarah?
you never die, and you always want something.
I need you to look at these photographs, tell me if you recognize anybody.
I know it's been a long time, but...
no.
nobody. Sorry.
there's one of them maybe involved with skynet right now.
they might not even know it.
sorry to bother you.
I'll leave you alone.
the fourth photo.
the young one.
his name is Andrew Goode. Andy.
he was an intern at Cyberdyne one summer.
miles liked him.
is he going to die too?
is that what happens now, he dies?
I don't know.
I hope not.
well, if he does, just make sure it matters.
make sure it's not in vain.
no one dies in vain.
agent Ellison.
they told me you were coming.
but I told them the last time you worked a crime scene, Hoover was cross-dressing at quantico.
ballistics.
I can already tell you mine are bigger.
same gun that killed your boys here killed one of my cis.
what's the connection?
well, he made fake paper. Your guys
I hope you're not selling the terrorist cell theory,'cause I'm not buying it.
why not?
well, look at the print report.
there's nothing here. These guys were drug dealers, small-time.
definitely not worth you putting your tie on and breaking open your Thomas guide.
Oh, yeah.
you see this every day.
you didn't find that curious?
why would anyone wire a safe directly into the power?
Why's the sky blue, Ellison? Don't overthink it.
the guys were druggies. They're not rocket scientists, not terrorists.
your guy sold my guys paper.
my guys whacked your guy to cover their tracks.
go back to your office. Your desk misses you.
right. Good one.
somebody came back here for whatever was in that safe.
they're out there.
and I'm gonna find them.
can I help you?
no.
just looking.
you just kept looking over like you needed something.
that's the phone.
seriously, if I was gonna be alone on a desert island with only a phone for a companion, that would absolutely be the phone.
is that something you would do?
may I?
got a four-meg camera.
Texting-- true texting too.
not that sms cartoon bubble junk.
3g data access. 10 gigs free music.
what happens if I press these numbers here?
scuse me?
these numbers, one through nine.
if I press seven of them, will someone talk to me through the ear part up here?
Yeah.
okay. I'll take three.
Hello?
are you calling me?
I was just following up to make sure everything's okay with the phones.
I just left the store.
I know.
okay. Do you wanna have dinner with me tonight?
no.
well, you answered too quickly.
hear me out. Just give me one minute.
30 seconds? - Talk fast.
okay, well, first let me clear up the whole desert island and a cell phone thing.
seems kind of strange if you picture it.
I wasn't.
right, of course. Why would you?
it's an asinine sales pitch, really.
there's nowhere to plug in the phone.
it would be worthless than a rock when the battery died.
couldn't even use it to open a coconut.
this is you selling yourself?
selling myself?
Oh, I don't know. There's something immoral about the whole selling process.
and yet, that's your job.
part-time.
and I'm not very good at it.
so I'm actually less immoral than the average... anyway.
where was I?
you're right.
about what?
I answered too quick.
Mr. Baum. - Yes.
take your seat, please.
okay, paper and pencil out.
time for a pop quiz.
here.
come in.
I said come on in.
I'm transferring in.
okay. Any open seat.
what part about don't act like a freak didn't you understand?
sit down.
like I said on the phone, your sweet uncle Enrique lived a colorful life.
one we have not yet painted in full.
you grow apart.
every day's a new adventure.
who can keep up?
I got an uncle who's like a father.
I also got one who's like a stranger.
how 'bout you two?
more like an a aunt.
chatty, chatty.
all right.
so you're not too close.
but he did call you three times the day he was murdered.
What'd you chat about?
well, those Lakers.
Really? What about 'em?
kobe. He's the bomb.
I always thought he was a ball hog.
he's all alone, man.
he's got no one else who can shoot.
is that you, Carlos?
now that your uncle's dead?
you all alone?
yeah...
all these boys can shoot.
I didn't kill my uncle. - No.
and you're too smart to know nothing about who did.
I'll be in touch.
no, I-I know.
the guy's 18 months ahead of the Germans.
Yeah, well, I would if I had that kinda grant money.
no, I'm not saying the guy's a complete idiot.
but it's not exactly avant-garde science, is it?
I mean, why don't they give the money to the people on the cutting edge?
but they never do. They never
how was school?
I have a metal plate in my head.
she's gonna need a note.
I meant you, not her.
Yeah, fine.
you're not gonna give me anything?
we went, we learned.
I didn't get killed.
she didn't kill anybody.
it was a pretty good first day, I think.
what about you-- did you go?
I did.
and how was she? Surprised to see you weren't dead?
more like disappointed.
she id'd one of the safe house photos.
intern at Cyberdyne. - Really?
so what does he do now, work in a lab or build rocket guidance systems or something?
cell phone salesman.
shut up.
cell phone salesman. And not a very good one.
these need to be cleaned.
okay, so about the cell phone guy.
I-I'm having dinner with him tonight.
dinner?
what do you mean, like a date?
not a date.
are you going to kill him?
kill him?
I don't know the first thing about him.
he interned at Cyberdyne when he was in college.
his photo's in a pile of photos.
nobody dies till I say so.
tell her.
people die all the time.
they won't wait for her.
I fooled you again.
who are you?
how did you find me?
What--what do you want?
are you a veteran?
is that what this is about?
do you speak?
read that.
h-how did you...
no, no, no. That's not possible.
that's an epidermal growth rate. That's just not sustainable.
keratinocyte and-- a-at that rate, you couldn't possibly maintain cell regulation or differentiation.
I-it's impossible.
possible.
woo was wrong.
Thomason was wrong.
Parker and Lang were almost right and still...completely wrong.
well, I-I-I'd have to go to my lab.
there's a whole mix of growth rates, uh, tgf beta, uh, pdgf, egf.
I'd need...
you know, there's a lot of equipment.
Oh, and blood.
we'd need, um, at least0 units.
preferably with tissues comprised of
I brought my own.
can you do it?
Yes, I can.
in 1943, the German physicist Werner Heisenberg delivered a physics lecture to a packed hall in Zurich.
one of the audience members was Moe Berg, an ex-professional baseball player working as a spy for the O. S.S.
berg's task was to listen to the lecture and determine whether Heisenberg and the Germans were close to perfecting the atomic bomb.
if Berg discovered that this was the case, he was to wait for Heisenberg outside the hall and shoot the scientist in the head.
he had never killed anyone before.
so what's your deal, Andy?
I can't imagine you majored in cell phone sales at college.
no. No.
more like funions and 12-packs of jolt from the vintage soda store while my roommates and I hacked Zelda iii so the princess would say funny lines ripped from reruns what's that language you speak, boy?
computer science.
Caltech.
Advanced...dork.
and what would you do with a computer degree from Caltech?
I don't know. I never got one.
my father died senior year.
mom went a little off the rails.
I dropped out to help.
I'm sorry.
that was a long time ago, but...
thanks anyway.
she's good. She married the security guard at her bank.
you have family?
distant.
don't take this the wrong way, but as a cell phone salesman, I think I can ask.
did you ever wanna be anything other than a waitress?
Yes, I did.
I can't remember.
what's this, Andy?
Oh, isn't it great?
that is the official promotional poster for the Kramnik deep Fritz match.
awesome match. Just awesome.
most people cite the '97 Kasparov/Deep Blue as the watershed man versus machine chess match.
but, uh...
Fritz would have wiped the floor with blue just like Kramnik did with Kasparov.
besides, the other poster's impossible to find.
what is it you do, Andy?
do you wanna see?
Yes, I wanna see.
all right.
behold.
well, not the original Turk.
the original Turk was an automaton constructed and unveiled in 1770
by the Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen.
it played chess.
is that what your Turk does?
it plays chess?
I know that sounds boring as hell.
most people think so.
but maybe I should put it this way.
my Turk plays chess at a level that could defeat every human player that has ever lived and probably ever will live.
that's not bragging, really.
a number of AIs can do that now.
but the AIs chess platform is very valuable for artificial intelligence developers these days.
what?
I thought I saw someone outside.
uh, yeah, it's a prowler.
back porch.
it's the police. There's been some break-ins in the neighborhood.
my -- I have to go, Andy.
no, Sarah, wait.
it's 165 Mesrow.
again -- what did it look like?
what did it look like?
who cares what it looked like?
it was just a rack of computer equipment.
okay, but was there obvious network access?
do you know what kind of bandwidth?
you're joking.
what about power supply?
was there a cooling element, like a fan or something?
mom, I'm just trying to get a sense of the horsepower.
I wanna know if this thing was a...
dinky little homemade soap box or if it was a full-fledged AI platform capable of learning and growing and taking on other applications.
it plays chess.
so did Einstein.
have you ever heard of the singularity?
it's a point in time where machines become so smart that they're capable of making even making smarter versions of themselves without our help.
that's pretty much the time we can kiss our asses good-bye.
unless we stop it.
like you said you would.
so I caught a break on a set of fingerprints from our drug dealers.
I wanted to see your face when I laid that on you.
see, the only fingerprint database I hadn't checked was kid prints.
that's no joke.
that's him -- that's one of your dead terrorists.
a black-haired, brown-eyed 35-pound four-year-old boy living in Canton, Ohio.
and that's the look I wanted to see.
hold up.
did your crime scene guys find any peculiar blood?
I think they got all the peculiar they could stomach with these prints.
lab says some blood evidence found at my ci crime scene is almost human...
except there's no red blood cells present.
I wanna see the blood evidence from your guys.
I'll get back to you.
you're gonna...double-check those prints, right?
on the kid in Canton?
have a party.
the one thing I hadn't thought of, the one thing nobody thought possible was the use of a synthetic oxygen carrier.
by creating a synthetic spear that carries oxygen, bringing nutrients to the skin, it obviates the need for the marrow interaction.
the real world applications are...
mind-blowing.
it's ready.
I, uh, have a video camera.
would it be all right if
move away.
who are you?
what are you?
didn't you get my message?
I returned your call about the test results.
y-yeah, I got your message.
Yeah. You're healthy as a horse.
a healthy horse.
I got that from your message.
I wanted to talk to you about prevention.
for cancer?
what you're doing seems to be working.
specifically.
um...don't smoke.
get lots of exercise.
eat leafy greens.
don't snort asbestos
I don't mean to make light, but you've got no risk factors.
no genetic disposition.
is there anything else about your history that I should know?
no.
you've got children, right?
Yeah, I got two myself.
you worry. You wanna make sure you're always healthy and strong for them.
don't drive yourself crazy chasing the future.
we can't predict...
you know? We can only try and prevent.
Andy, it's Sarah.
Hey. - Hi.
you going to chem? - Yeah.
what is going on? - No idea.
she is such a skanky, slutty whore.
I can't even talk to her ever again.
I love this color.
it's tight, right?
this color's tight.
what is it?
rash.
it's so tight.
I'm a pig.
I look pregnant.
does it make me look fat?
Yes.
what the hell?
what's your problem?
you asked.
bitch whore much?
I don't understand.
I said bitch...whore...much?
what are you looking at?
I'm looking at you.
you saw it, right?
right? You saw it?
it's so...freakin' big, and right out there!
it's freaking big.
right.
it is, right?
whoever's doing this is such a jackass.
I mean, who would do this?
and how would they even know?
my parents...they're gonna kill me.
kill me!
I mean, don't we have hall monitors or something?
I mean, how could someone just
you're upset.
no kidding I'm upset.
my life is freaking over!
here's a present.
it's tight.
well, I have to admit, I wondered if I'd see you again.
miracles happen every day.
that's funny.
that was a joke, right?
if it was funny, it was a joke.
so the, uh, police recommended I put in a security system.
armed patrol, that kind of thing.
can't really afford it, though.
you think someone wants the Turk?
well, eight years of my life.
not just the software.
I customized the hardware too.
one month, I worked so much on a motherboard that I lost my sight for three days.
no, that really happened.
those circuits are so small.
a lot of the gears I actually pulled from gaming platforms.
did you know that the military uses them?
Yeah, I've got the guts of three xboxes and four playstations daisy-chained.
plus some seriously modded-out code that I swear came to me in a dream.
and all this to beat another computer at chess.
none of this to beat another computer at chess.
then what?
what are you doing?
would you believe me if I told you Turk has moods?
obviously not in the sense that you and I understand mood, but sometimes I'll feed it a particular chess problem, and it'll solve it one way.
the next day, I feed it the same problem, and it solves it differently.
once in a while, it can't even solve it at all.
do you know why it does that?
no.
Yeah, neither do I.
Someday...I'm gonna figure it out.
someday, Turk'll tell me.
you talk about it like it's human.
well, you never know.
what?
too far?
what is it?
nothing.
nothing at all.
do you like this color on me?
what?
I'm a bitch whore.
what?
I have a new friend.
did she tell you you were a bitch whore?
no. She cried.
Wait--what?
okay, what the hell is this thing?
jumper! Outside the gym!
jump! Jump!
shut up.
she's not gonna jump.
she's just trying to get attention.
jump!
dude, come on!
that's my new friend.
the crying one from the bathroom.
when?
two hours, three minutes ago.
four minutes ago.
she's upset.
her parents are going to kill her.
did you do anything to her?
I tried to give her a tight present.
we gotta help her--now! - No.
I'm going up there.
let me go--I order you to let me go!
don't be a freak.
gotta go--now.
I could have done something.
I was right there.
maybe.
come on, mom.
John, people who wanna take their own lives, this girl...
if they're serious about it, they'll find a way.
you didn't see her.
if you'd have seen her, you wouldn't be talking like this.
what were you gonna do, be a hero?
get your name in the papers, your face?
isn't that what I'm supposed to be? A hero?
isn't that who I am?
if it's just gonna sit inside me, if it's just gonna sit in my gut, then what are we doing?
what's the point?
why not just give it to them if we're gonna act like them?
I don't know how to help him.
Andy Goode must be killed.
took his eyes, James.
took his friggin' eyes.
on july 16th, 1945, in the mountains outside of Los Alamos, New Mexico, the world's first atomic bomb exploded.
a white light pierced the sky with such intensity that a blind girl claimed to see the flash from a hundred miles away.
after witnessing the explosion,
J. Robert Oppenheimer quoted a fragment of the bhagavad ga, declaring, "I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.
his colleague, Ken Bainbridge, put it another way when he leaned close to Oppenheimer and whispered, "now we are all sons of bitches.
now we are all sons of bitches.
in the future, my son will lead mankind in a war against skynet, a computer system programmed to destroy the world.
it has sent machines back through time.
some to kill him.
one to protect him.
today we fight to stop skynet from ever being created.
to change our future.
to change his fate.
the war to save mankind begins now.
my turk plays chess at a level that could defeat every human player that has ever lived and probably ever will live.
this is my partner, dimitri shipkoff.
I built the tubut dimitri taught it to play chess.
you talk about it like it's human.
well, you never know.
show me what you found.
no name, but he's got this tattoo on his arm.
that's a tattoo from a skynet work camp.
he's a resistance fighter.
than you know him in the future.
so do you do.
he's one of your best soldiers.
it was you, wasn't it?
you wanted to kill him, and you did.
I didn't do it.
all I wanted was the turk.
somebody else killed him and took the machine.
you gotta get out of herE.
if you haven't figured it out, I have a t-888 on my ass.
now if you found me, it will too.
he needs a doctor.
what, so you're just gonna go out and kidnap one?
don't let that thing touch me.
we have to stop you bleeding. - Get away from me!
you don't even know who this guy is!
he's your uncle.
he doesn't know.
central LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT
possible forced entry and sabotage at vista terrace power planet.
all available units respond, code 3.
they say when a person dies, the soul lives on.
the soul.
the thing that separates us from the machines.
cameron had burned the metal monster.
2, 000 degrees.
I suppose they did the same to andy.
there was nothing left of either.
nothing that told the story of who or what they were.
gone is gone.
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
when I go, bury me in the earth.
a part of me died years ago with kyle reese, but a part of me lives on in john.
it's that not a soul, I don't know what is.
the triple eight.
vaporized.
the russian, dimitri.
you found him?
he took off after andy's murder.
no, if he has the turk, then...
put the machine on it.
she'll find him. It's
I know.
it's what they do.
how is he?
better.
still pretty out of it.
is he, uh, gonna stay here or what?
let's see if he lives first.
and somewhere in this city, a naked cop bleeds in an alley.
the hand.
I couldn't acquire it.
why not?
the fbi has it.
you're playing hooky.
Today--no, i can't miss class today, mom.
well, we have to find the hand.
destroy it. No loose ends.
Cyberdyne built skynet- - with the chip, remember?
and the hand.
look, the feds have it now, mom.
I can't help.
besides, absent gets me on the radar.
I can play hooky.
find dimitri.
Derek says he has a sister who teaches ballet.
start with her.
low profile, no guns.
you might want to change yeah, this is sergeant johnson, senior property over at lapd.
got a little problem. Wonder if you could help me.
what's going on?
I got this new booking officer rookie.
between you and me, I think he was drunk when logged evidence on a robbery we had.
might have ended up on your felony escape.
what are you missing?
prosthetic hand.
Really? - Really.
D. R.Number?
I can send someone to pick it up.
uh, I don't see any hand on here.
you sure?
item 17.
hang on a second.
agent ellison? - yeah?
I got lapd property on the line.
they're asking about a hand. From your felony escape.
they have it listed on the authorization, but we don't have a record of it.
I never saw any hand, fake or otherwise.
agent in charge says he never saw it.
want to talk to him?
no, no, I'll take his word. Thanks.
and wonder if god or the devil...
or even death itself was sending me a message from the future all the way back through time.
machines, sarah.
machines.
you can pretend they're not, but they are coming.
and they are faster and stronger.
and they've been built to do one perfect thing.
to kill you.
they will kill you.
and your friends and your family.
and your mother and your father.
and kyle reese and your son.
your son!
they will kill everyone you love and everyone you hold close, and there is nothing you can do about it.
because they are coming.
they are coming, and they will find you.
because that's what they do! That's all they do!
that's all they do! - I need help here!
get in here! - They'll kill you!
come on, where's the stuff? - They will kill you!
now if what you're saying is true, sarah, surely there would be some evidence.
no one believes me.
thank you.
so this is where sarah connor spent three years of her life.
this is it.
Dr. Silverman retired right after she escaped.
where is he these days?
got himself a cabin in the mountains near arrowhead.
growing his own vegetables, working on his book.
we don't hear much from him anymore.
I'd love to talk to any other staff that was here when she escaped.
unfortunately, there's no one left.
not even a janitor?
how long would you work here if you could find another job?
right.
good.
long reach down.
excellent turnout. Hold!
hold.
and close.
beautiful. Thank you.
see you all next week.
what is she doing?
step of the cat.
will you show me?
that is the advanced class.
you are a beginner, yeah?
you have taken ballet before.
no.
the height is nice. Beautiful feet.
but your upper body is a little mechanical, yeah?
remember, you are a cat.
I'm a cat.
come next week.
we need to develop your flexibility and your imagination.
remember...
dance is the hidden language of the soul, yeah?
stop coming here.
where is he?
I don't know where he is.
don't play with me Maria.
please leave
he owes me money
give him the message or he'll be sorry
what are you doing?
what's it look like?
looks like you're loading guns that I know for a fact were already loaded.
true enough.
I loaded 'em.
look, no offense.
I just don't like firing a weapon I didn't set myself.
anyway, you should take it into the kitchen or something.
mom wouldn't like you doing this in her room.
Why?
because it's her room.
listen, um...
the paramedic that patched me up.
Where'd he come from?
that's charlie.
he was her boyfriend.
her fiance.
actually, a long time ago.
he's a liability.
look, man, he's not gonna tell anybody.
how do you know?
because I know him. I trust him.
I can't believe you trust anybody.
maybe it's just him.
you trust the machine.
Cameron-- - yeah, cameron.
what a joke.
walking around with a name.
like it's a person. It's not a person.
it's not something you should be trusting.
what's going on?
nothing.
I need you to get on the computer and find an address.
you're making a mistake.
how's that?
the machine has gotta go.
this morning you had me sending her out to do our dirty work.
dirty work is all they're good for.
don't let yourself think that you can train them like a pet, because it'll be the last thing that you think.
john- - john doesn't know everything.
you should be resting.
they never rest.
you can't have that thing here.
can't sleep with it here.
that gonna help?
you never know.
does it help to sleep on the whole trunk?
go into my bedroom again, I'll bust your head.
what happened with the ballet teacher?
dance is the hidden language of the soul.
first you have to have a soul.
I mean about dimitri or the turk.
I'm going back today.
what's the status on the hand?
got a good idea who has it. - Who?
FBI agent ellison.
same guy that questioned me in county lockup?
what, they only have one fbi agent in this town?
only one who can put this whole thing together.
from what I saw at his house, maybe he already has.
pancakes.
we eat at the table.
your pancakes are getting cold.
here's dr. Silverman's address.
you're not hungry? - No.
since when?
ms. Connor, I'm from dcfs.
I've brought some paperwork for you.
everything should be in order.
all we have to do is cross the t's dot the basically states that you voluntarily and unequivocally consent, that you have been advised of the legal consequences of this relinquishment, that you understand that your consent is irrevocable.
and once these papers are signed, all parental rights will be terminated.
and sign here.
we'll get a certified copy to the judge.
guess you're not hungry either.
you might have fooled them, but not me.
I know you.
I know you too.
Dr. Silverman.
can I help you?
special agent james ellison.
Oh, hello. What can I do for you, agent?
I'd like to talk to you about sarah connor.
you like to come in?
thank you.
well, I don't like to use the term textbook in relation to any of my patients, but sarah connor was depressed, anxiety-ridden, manic...
violent with paranoid delusions.
is that what it was?
delusions?
robots, soldiers of the future, apocalypse.
you tell me.
also she could be remarkably charming.
even persuasive.
beware of false prophets.
you a man of the book?
it has brought me comfort at times.
more tea?
um, yes, yes, thank yoU.
the thing that most people don't understand about psychiatry is that it is an imperfect science.
what are you doing here?
watching you.
I'm--I'm a little out of shape.
teaching takes all my time.
my brother says if you want to be good at anything you have to practice every day.
your brother is right.
do you have a brother?
Yes.
is he a dancer like you?
he plays chess.
so does my brother.
excuse me.
I can see to it that you never dance again i can see to it ...that you will never dance again
get lost.
do you have any idea who this is?
no.
do you?
who are you?
you're just a girl.
how did you do that?
I'm looking for your brother.
are you police?
I've already told the police everything I know.
no, I'm not police.
but I do find them useful.
what do you want?
I can help your brother.
tell me where he is.
Un--untie me.
hmm, fbi. That's a good touch.
What--who--who do you think I am?
I know who you are.
coming here asking about sarah connor.
Yes.
Matthew 7: 15.
but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
you're from the future. You're one of them.
I'm--oh, come on.
okay, if I was who you say I am, then how could
how could you poison me?
the tea was a test.
but then it occurred to me that you could be an advanced model smart enough to trick me into thinking you were passed out.
Oh, come on.
look...
okay, kidnapping an fbi agent is a federal offense.
carries a sentence of life in prison.
if--if you let me go now, we'll forget this ever happened, okay?
once you're far away
wait, wait, whoa, no!
you can't, no!
no
John hasn't been answering his cell phone.
when he gets home, you tell him we need to talk.
where you heading?
I think ellison might be there.
he's a strong boy.
you know, strong-- strong opinions.
I don't know where he gets that.
his father?
out of the picture.
that's too bad.
can I ask you about my brother?
John told me he died fighting.
do you know...where he is now?
in the grass.
I can take you there someday if you want.
it's an honest mistake.
can't be too careful.
So...tell me.
do you believe inhe apocalypse, agent?
Yeah, um...I've read revelations.
could it be that the apocalypse in the book and the predictions of sarah connor are one and the same?
um, I suppose it's possible.
what do you think?
he came down the hall.
it was a large man.
I thought it was a man until...
he threw the guard through the window just like a rag doll.
not an ounce of emotion.
this blank-- like a death mask.
then the other one came.
there was two of them?
there were different.
the second one was almost beautiful.
like perfect.
like a changeling.
the face of mercury.
what about sarah?
she was there.
she was on the floor.
and the boy was with her.
he was screaming.
and then the--the first one, the big one, I'll never forget.
he--he reached out his hand and he said,"come with me if you want to live.
like god reaching out to man.
like-- like the sistine chapel.
the hand of god.
hand of god.
Yeah.
though...
there's no proof, so we don't talk about it.
all of us who were there.
what if I told you I have proof?
what do you mean?
a piece of evidence I found during my investigation.
that's why I came to you.
for your corroboration.
to show you that sarah wasn't crazy.
Nobody...is crazy.
what is it?
the hand of god.
good thing you told me about this.
Yeah.
I told you I'm-- I'm on your side.
I wish that were true.
what does that mean?
do you know what would happen if the wrong people got a hold of this?
I can't let you stop her.
she's dead.
Well...so was jesus once.
you won't feel a thing, I promise.
What--no, no!
dug up some clean t-shirts for you.
Thanks.
I wasn't sure how many you'd need.
depends on how long you're staying.
not that great sleeping on the couch, is it?
slept on a few of them myself.
yeah?
when was that?
when my mom was locked up.
I kicked around.
with friends and foster families.
mom was in prison?
mental hospital.
you go around blowing up buildings and ranting about robots, it happens.
it sounds rough.
there was this, uh-- there was this one family.
Todd and janelle.
I was with them for a while, and, uh...
they were okay.
of course, I hated them.
they wanted to adopt me.
I'm sure your mom would've died before she let that happen.
Yeah, you'd think.
look, john
what can happen to a person inside four walls, um, screws with your head.
makes you do things you never thought you'd do.
some people never give up.
some people always fight.
fewer than you think.
so you ever wonder what happened to todd and janelle?
no.
I know what happened.
I got them killed.
who is she?
my friend i told you not to bring anyone here she can help us someone could have followed you i had to tell someone. she can help us what are you thinking?
what can she help us with?
tell him. Come on.
I have money
you're the one who reported the turk missing.
do you have more?
what happened to it?
a man came to see me.
offered me money to steal the turk.
I owed a lot of money to the people who helped me bring my sister into this country.
so I changed the endgame protocols in order for it to lose its last match.
if we'd won, and we would've won, I never could've got her out of there.
We--I was paid money for it. 20000
it wasn't enough.
I need more of these.
please, I need more of thesE.
who bought the turk?
that's all I have.
okay?
thank you for explaining.
where are you going? Hey, where you go?
you promised you would help us!
Oh, my god.
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.
apology accepted.
help! help!
get up!
where is it?
she took it.
what? Who?
she took it.
she took it.
did you find the turk?
Dimitri stole it from andy, then sold it to a man.
who?
Where's dimitri now?
dead.
so is his sister.
did you kill them?
no.
it wasn't my mission.
I never wanted you to see that tape.
I was gonna destroy it.
but since you did, did you notice the date?
the date on the tape.
june 8, 1997.
do you know that date?
I do now.
that's the date you gave up being my mother.
that's the date I broke out of there.
the day you came for me, I was coming for you.
because about three seconds after I signed that paper,
I knew I couldn't live without it.
I was coming for you, and I was gonna die trying.
you almost did.
so did you.
and you were mad as hell about it.
you yelled at me.
told me what a stupid move it was.
I might've oversold that a little.
I'll always find you.
I'll always find you.
there was a time I was a hero to my son.
he thought I walked on water.
he knows better now.
we all have weak moments.
moments where we lose faith.
but it's our flaws, our weaknesses, that make us human.
they're here.
they're here.
they're here!
they're everywhere!
they're here!
they're here!
science now performs miracles like the gods of old, creating life from blood cells, or bacteria, or a spark of metal.
but they're perfect creatures.
and in that way, they couldn't be less human.
there are things machines will never do.
Theyannot possess faith.
they cannot commune with god.
every tree that no bringeth forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.
they cannot appreciate beauty.
they cannot create art.
if they ever learn these things, they won't have to destroy us.
they'll be us.
in the future, my son will lead mankind in a war against skynet a computer system programmed to destroy the world.
it has sent machines back through time.
some to kill him.
one to protect him.
today we fight to stop skynet from ever being created.
to change our future.
to change his fate.
the war to save mankind begins now.
my Turk plays chess at a level that could defeat every human player that has ever lived and probably ever will live.
this is my partner, Dimitri Shipkoff.
I built the tubut Dimitri taught it to play chess.
you talk about it like it's human.
well, you never know.
show me what you found.
no name, but he's got this tattoo on his arm.
that's a tattoo from a skynet work camp.
he's a resistance fighter.
than you know him in the future.
so do you do.
he's one of your best soldiers.
it was you, wasn't it?
you wanted to kill him, and you did.
I didn't do it.
all I wanted was the Turk.
somebody else killed him and took the machine.
you gotta get out of her E.
if you haven't figured it out, I have a t-888 on my ass.
now if you found me, it will too.
he needs a doctor.
what, so you're just gonna go out and kidnap one?
don't let that thing touch me.
we have to stop you bleeding. - Get away from me!
you don't even know who this guy is!
he's your uncle.
he doesn't know.
[ central LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT ]
possible forced entry and sabotage at vista terrace power planet.
all available units respond, code 3.
they say when a person dies, the soul lives on.
the soul.
the thing that separates us from the machines.
cameron had burned the metal monster.
2, 000 degrees.
I suppose they did the same to Andy.
there was nothing left of either.
nothing that told the story of who or what they were.
gone is gone.
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
when I go, bury me in the earth.
a part of me died years ago with Kyle reese, but a part of me lives on in John.
it's that not a soul, Idon't know what is.
the triple eight.
vaporized.
the russian, Dimitri.
you found him?
he took off after Andy's murder.
no, if he has the Turk, then...
put the machine on it.
she'll findhim. It's
I know.
it's what they do.
how is he?
better.
still pretty out of it.
is he, uh, gonna stay here or what?
let's see if he lives first.
and somewhere in this city, anaked cop bleeds in an alley.
the hand.
I couldn't acquire it.
why not?
the fbi has it.
you're playing hooky.
Today--no, I can't miss class today, mom.
well, we have to find the hand.
destroy it. No loose ends.
Cyberdyne built skynet - with the chip, remember?
and the hand.
look, the feds have it now, mom.
I can't help.
besides, absent gets me on the radar.
I can play hooky.
find Dimitri.
Derek says he has a sister who teaches ballet.
start with her.
low profile, no guns.
you might want to change yeah, this is sergeant Johnson senior property over at lapd.
got a little problem. Wonder if you could help me.
what's going on?
I got this new booking officer rookie.
between you and me, I think he was drunk when logged evidence on a robbery we had.
might have ended up on your felony escape.
what are you missing?
prosthetic hand.
Really? - Really.
D. R.Number?
I can send someone to pick it up.
uh, I don't see any hand on here.
you sure?
item 17.
hang on a second.
agent ellison? - yeah?
I got lapd property on the line.
they're asking about a hand. From your felony escape.
they have it listed on the authorization, but we don't have a record of it.
I never saw any hand, fake or otherwise.
agent in charge says he never saw it.
want to talk to him?
no, no, I'll take his word. Thanks.
and wonder if god or the devil...
or even death itself was sending me a message from the future all the way back through time.
machines, Sarah.
machines.
you can pretend they're not, but they are coming.
and they are faster and stronger.
and they've been built to do one perfect thing.
to kill you.
they will kill you.
and your friends and your family.
and your mother and your father.
and kyle reese and your son.
your son!
they will kill everyone you love and everyone you hold close and there is nothing you can do about it.
because they are coming.
they are coming, and they will find you.
because that's what they do! That's all they do!
that's all they do! - I need help here!
get in here! - They'll kill you!
come on, where's the stuff? - They will kill you!
now if what you're saying is true, Sarah, surely there would be some evidence.
no one believes me.
thank you.
so this is where Sarah Connor spent three years of her life.
this is it.
Dr. Silverman retired right after she escaped.
where is he these days?
got himself a cabin in the mountains near arrowhead.
growing his own vegetables, working on his book.
we don't hear much from him anymore.
I'd love to talk to any other staff that was here when she escaped.
unfortunately, there's no one left.
not even a janitor?
how long would you work here if you could find another job?
right.
good.
long reach down.
excellent turnout. Hold!
hold.
and close.
beautiful. Thank you.
see you all next week.
what is she doing?
step of the cat.
will you show me?
that is the advanced class.
you are a beginner, yeah?
you have taken ballet before.
no.
the height is nice. Beautiful feet.
but your upper body is a little mechanical, yeah?
remember, you are a cat.
I'm a cat.
come next week.
we need to develop your flexibility and your imagination.
remember...
dance is the hidden language of the soul, yeah?
stop coming here.
where is he?
I don't know where he is.
don't play with me Maria.
please leave
he owes me money
give him the message or he'll be sorry
what are you doing?
what's it look like?
looks like you're loading guns that I know for a fact were already loaded.
true enough.
I loaded 'em.
look, no offense.
I just don't like firing a weapon I didn't set myself.
anyway, you should take it into the kitchen or something.
mom wouldn't like you doing this in her room.
Why?
because it's her room.
listen, um...
the paramedic that patched me up.
Where'd he come from?
that's charlie.
he was her boyfriend.
her fiance.
actually, a long time ago.
he's a liability.
look, man, he's not gonna tell anybody.
how do you know?
because I know him. I trust him.
I can't believe you trust anybody.
maybe it's just him.
you trust the machine.
cameron - Yeah, Cameron
what a joke.
walking around with a name.
like it's a person. It's not a person.
it's not something you should be trusting.
what's going on?
nothing.
I need you to get on the computer and find an address.
you're making a mistake.
how's that?
the machine has gotta go.
this morning you had me sending her out to do our dirty work.
dirty work is all they're good for.
don't let yourself think that you can train them like a pet because it'll be the last thing that you think.
John - John doesn't know everything.
you should be resting.
they never rest.
you can't have that thing here.
can't sleep with it here.
that gonna help?
you never know.
does it help to sleep on the whole trunk?
go into my bedroom again, I'll bust your head.
what happened with the ballet teacher?
dance is the hidden language of the soul.
first you have to have a soul.
I mean about Dimitri or the Turk.
I'm going back today.
what's the status on the hand?
got a good idea who has it. - Who?
FBI agent ellison.
same guy that questioned me in county lockup?
what, they only have one fbi agent in this town?
only one who can put this whole thing together.
from what I saw at his house, maybe he already has.
pancakes.
we eat at the table.
your pancakes are getting cold.
here's dr. Silverman's address.
you're not hungry? - No.
since when?
ms. Connor, I'm from DCFS.
I've brought some paperwork for you.
everything should be in order.
all we have to do is cross the t's dot the basically states that you voluntarily and unequivocally consent that you have been advised of the legal consequences of this relinquishment that you understand that your consent is irrevocable.
and once these papers are signed, all parental rights will be terminated.
and sign here.
we'll get a certified copy to the judge.
guess you're not hungry either.
you might have fooled them, but not me.
I know you.
I know you too.
Dr. Silverman.
can I help you?
special agent james ellison.
Oh, hello. What can I do for you, agent?
I'd like to talk to you about Sarah Connor.
you like to come in?
thank you.
well, I don't like to use the term textbook in relation to any of my patients but Sarah Connor was depressed, anxiety-ridden, manic...
violent with paranoid delusions.
is that what it was?
delusions?
robots, soldiers of the future, apocalypse.
you tell me.
also she could be remarkably charming.
even persuasive.
beware of false prophets.
you a man of the book?
it has brought me comfort at times.
more tea?
um, yes, yes, thank you.
the thing that most people don't understand about psychiatry is that it is an imperfect science.
what are you doing here?
watching you.
I'm--I'm a little out of shape.
teaching takes all my time.
my brother says if you want to be good at anything you have to practice every day.
your brother is right.
do you have a brother?
Yes.
is he a dancer like you?
he plays chess.
so does my brother.
excuse me.
I can see to it that you never dance again i can see to it ...that you will never dance again
get lost.
do you have any idea who this is?
no.

Yes.

destroy it. No loose ends.
Cyberdyne built skynet- - with the chip, remember?
and the hand.
look, the feds have it now, mom.
I can't help.
besides, absent gets me on the radar.
I can play hooky.
find dimitri.
Derek says he has a sister who teaches ballet.
start with her.
low profile, no guns.
you might want to change yeah, this is sergeant johnson, senior property over at lapd.
got a little problem. Wonder if you could help me.
what's going on?
I got this new booking officer rookie.
between you and me, I think he was drunk when logged evidence on a robbery we had.
might have ended up on your felony escape.
what are you missing?
prosthetic hand.
Really? - Really.
D. R.Number?
I can send someone to pick it up.
uh, I don't see any hand on here.
you sure?
item 17.
hang on a second.
agent ellison? - yeah?
I got lapd property on the line.
they're asking about a hand. From your felony escape.
they have it listed on the authorization, but we don't have a record of it.
I never saw any hand, fake or otherwise.
agent in charge says he never saw it.
want to talk to him?
no, no, I'll take his word. Thanks.
and wonder if god or the devil...
or even death itself was sending me a message from the future all the way back through time.
machines, sarah.
machines.
you can pretend they're not, but they are coming.
and they are faster and stronger.
and they've been built to do one perfect thing.
to kill you.
they will kill you.
and your friends and your family.
and your mother and your father.
and kyle reese and your son.
your son!
they will kill everyone you love and everyone you hold close, and there is nothing you can do about it.
because they are coming.
they are coming, and they will find you.
because that's what they do! That's all they do!
that's all they do! - I need help here!
get in here! - They'll kill you!
come on, where's the stuff? - They will kill you!
now if what you're saying is true, sarah, surely there would be some evidence.
no one believes me.
thank you.
so this is where sarah connor spent three years of her life.
this is it.
Dr. Silverman retired right after she escaped.
where is he these days?
got himself a cabin in the mountains near arrowhead.
growing his own vegetables, working on his book.
we don't hear much from him anymore.
I'd love to talk to any other staff that was here when she escaped.
unfortunately, there's no one left.
not even a janitor?
how long would you work here if you could find another job?
right.
good.
long reach down.
excellent turnout. Hold!
hold.
and close.
beautiful. Thank you.
see you all next week.
what is she doing?
step of the cat.
will you show me?
that is the advanced class.
you are a beginner, yeah?
you have taken ballet before.
no.
the height is nice. Beautiful feet.
but your upper body is a little mechanical, yeah?
remember, you are a cat.
I'm a cat.
come next week.
we need to develop your flexibility and your imagination.
remember...
dance is the hidden language of the soul, yeah?
stop coming here.
where is he?
I don't know where he is.
don't play with me Maria.
please leave
he owes me money
give him the message or he'll be sorry
what are you doing?
what's it look like?
looks like you're loading guns that I know for a fact were already loaded.
true enough.
I loaded 'em.
look, no offense.
I just don't like firing a weapon I didn't set myself.
anyway, you should take it into the kitchen or something.
mom wouldn't like you doing this in her room.
Why?
because it's her room.
listen, um...
the paramedic that patched me up.
Where'd he come from?
that's charlie.
he was her boyfriend.
her fiance.
actually, a long time ago.
he's a liability.
look, man, he's not gonna tell anybody.
how do you know?
because I know him. I trust him.
I can't believe you trust anybody.
maybe it's just him.
you trust the machine.
Cameron-- - yeah, cameron.
what a joke.
walking around with a name.
like it's a person. It's not a person.
it's not something you should be trusting.
what's going on?
nothing.
I need you to get on the computer and find an address.
you're making a mistake.
how's that?
the machine has gotta go.
this morning you had me sending her out to do our dirty work.
dirty work is all they're good for.
don't let yourself think that you can train them like a pet, because it'll be the last thing that you think.
john- - john doesn't know everything.
you should be resting.
they never rest.
you can't have that thing here.
can't sleep with it here.
that gonna help?
you never know.
does it help to sleep on the whole trunk?
go into my bedroom again, I'll bust your head.
what happened with the ballet teacher?
dance is the hidden language of the soul.
first you have to have a soul.
I mean about dimitri or the turk.
I'm going back today.
what's the status on the hand?
got a good idea who has it. - Who?
FBI agent ellison.
same guy that questioned me in county lockup?
what, they only have one fbi agent in this town?
only one who can put this whole thing together.
from what I saw at his house, maybe he already has.
pancakes.
we eat at the table.
your pancakes are getting cold.
here's dr. Silverman's address.
you're not hungry? - No.
since when?
ms. Connor, I'm from dcfs.
I've brought some paperwork for you.
everything should be in order.
all we have to do is cross the t's dot the basically states that you voluntarily and unequivocally consent, that you have been advised of the legal consequences of this relinquishment, that you understand that your consent is irrevocable.
and once these papers are signed, all parental rights will be terminated.
and sign here.
we'll get a certified copy to the judge.
guess you're not hungry either.
you might have fooled them, but not me.
I know you.
I know you too.
Dr. Silverman.
can I help you?
special agent james ellison.
Oh, hello. What can I do for you, agent?
I'd like to talk to you about sarah connor.
you like to come in?
thank you.
well, I don't like to use the term textbook in relation to any of my patients, but sarah connor was depressed, anxiety-ridden, manic...
violent with paranoid delusions.
is that what it was?
delusions?
robots, soldiers of the future, apocalypse.
you tell me.
also she could be remarkably charming.
even persuasive.
beware of false prophets.
you a man of the book?
it has brought me comfort at times.
more tea?
um, yes, yes, thank yoU.
the thing that most people don't understand about psychiatry is that it is an imperfect science.
what are you doing here?
watching you.
I'm--I'm a little out of shape.
teaching takes all my time.
my brother says if you want to be good at anything you have to practice every day.
your brother is right.
do you have a brother?
Yes.
is he a dancer like you?
he plays chess.
so does my brother.
excuse me.
I can see to it that you never dance again i can see to it ...that you will never dance again
get lost.
do you have any idea who this is?
no.
do you?
who are you?
you're just a girl.
how did you do that?
I'm looking for your brother.
are you police?
I've already told the police everything I know.
no, I'm not police.
but I do find them useful.
what do you want?
I can help your brother.
tell me where he is.
Un--untie me.
hmm, fbi. That's a good touch.
What--who--who do you think I am?
I know who you are.
coming here asking about sarah connor.
Yes.
Matthew 7: 15.
but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
you're from the future. You're one of them.
I'm--oh, come on.
okay, if I was who you say I am, then how could
how could you poison me?
the tea was a test.
but then it occurred to me that you could be an advanced model smart enough to trick me into thinking you were passed out.
Oh, come on.
look...
okay, kidnapping an fbi agent is a federal offense.
carries a sentence of life in prison.
if--if you let me go now, we'll forget this ever happened, okay?
once you're far away
wait, wait, whoa, no!
you can't, no!
John hasn't been answering his cell phone.
when he gets home, you tell him we need to talk.
where you heading?
I think ellison might be there.
he's a strong boy.
you know, strong-- strong opinions.
I don't know where he gets that.
his father?
out of the picture.
that's too bad.
can I ask you about my brother?
John told me he died fighting.
do you know...where he is now?
in the grass.
I can take you there someday if you want.
it's an honest mistake.
can't be too careful.
So...tell me.
do you believe inhe apocalypse, agent?
Yeah, um...I've read revelations.
could it be that the apocalypse in the book and the predictions of sarah connor are one and the same?
um, I suppose it's possible.
what do you think?
he came down the hall.
it was a large man.
I thought it was a man until...
he threw the guard through the window just like a rag doll.
not an ounce of emotion.
this blank-- like a death mask.
then the other one came.
there was two of them?
there were different.
the second one was almost beautiful.
like perfect.
like a changeling.
the face of mercury.
what about sarah?
she was there.
she was on the floor.
and the boy was with her.
he was screaming.
and then the--the first one, the big one, I'll never forget.
he--he reached out his hand and he said,"come with me if you want to live.
like god reaching out to man.
like-- like the sistine chapel.
the hand of god.
hand of god.
Yeah.
though...
there's no proof, so we don't talk about it.
all of us who were there.
what if I told you I have proof?
what do you mean?
a piece of evidence I found during my investigation.
that's why I came to you.
for your corroboration.
to show you that sarah wasn't crazy.
Nobody...is crazy.
what is it?
the hand of god.
good thing you told me about this.
Yeah.
I told you I'm-- I'm on your side.
I wish that were true.
what does that mean?
do you know what would happen if the wrong people got a hold of this?
I can't let you stop her.
she's dead.
Well...so was jesus once.
you won't feel a thing, I promise.
dug up some clean t-shirts for you.
Thanks.
I wasn't sure how many you'd need.
depends on how long you're staying.
not that great sleeping on the couch, is it?
slept on a few of them myself.
yeah?
when was that?
when my mom was locked up.
I kicked around.
with friends and foster families.
mom was in prison?
mental hospital.
you go around blowing up buildings and ranting about robots, it happens.
it sounds rough.
there was this, uh-- there was this one family.
Todd and janelle.
I was with them for a while, and, uh...
they were okay.
of course, I hated them.
they wanted to adopt me.
I'm sure your mom would've died before she let that happen.
Yeah, you'd think.
what can happen to a person inside four walls, um, screws with your head.
makes you do things you never thought you'd do.
some people never give up.
some people always fight.
fewer than you think.
so you ever wonder what happened to todd and janelle?
no.
I know what happened.
I got them killed.
who is she?
my friend i told you not to bring anyone here she can help us someone could have followed you i had to tell someone. she can help us what are you thinking?
what can she help us with?
tell him. Come on.
I have money
you're the one who reported the turk missing.
do you have more?
what happened to it?
a man came to see me.
offered me money to steal the turk.
I owed a lot of money to the people who helped me bring my sister into this country.
so I changed the endgame protocols in order for it to lose its last match.
if we'd won, and we would've won, I never could've got her out of there.
We--I was paid money for it. 20000
it wasn't enough.
I need more of these.
please, I need more of thesE.
who bought the turk?
that's all I have.
okay?
thank you for explaining.
where are you going? Hey, where you go?
you promised you would help us!
Oh, my god.
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.
apology accepted.
help! help!
get up!
where is it?
she took it.
what? Who?
she took it.
she took it.
did you find the turk?
Dimitri stole it from andy, then sold it to a man.
who?
Where's dimitri now?
dead.
so is his sister.
did you kill them?
no.
it wasn't my mission.
I never wanted you to see that tape.
I was gonna destroy it.
but since you did, did you notice the date?
the date on the tape.
june 8, 1997.
do you know that date?
I do now.
that's the date you gave up being my mother.
that's the date I broke out of there.
the day you came for me, I was coming for you.
because about three seconds after I signed that paper,
I knew I couldn't live without it.
I was coming for you, and I was gonna die trying.
you almost did.
so did you.
and you were mad as hell about it.
you yelled at me.
told me what a stupid move it was.
I might've oversold that a little.
I'll always find you.
I'll always find you.
there was a time I was a hero to my son.
he thought I walked on water.
he knows better now.
we all have weak moments.
moments where we lose faith.
but it's our flaws, our weaknesses, that make us human.
they're here.
they're here.
they're here!
they're everywhere!
they're here!
they're here!
science now performs miracles like the gods of old, creating life from blood cells, or bacteria, or a spark of metal.
but they're perfect creatures.
and in that way, they couldn't be less human.
there are things machines will never do.
Theyannot possess faith.
they cannot commune with god.
every tree that no bringeth forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.
they cannot appreciate beauty.
they cannot create art.
if they ever learn these things, they won't have to destroy us.
they'll be us.
you been drinking?
so what are you in for?
I'm Jody.
what did you do-- did you hurt me?
is there a problem?
no, I'm her brother, John Baum.
whatever you say in here is confidential.
the only exception is if you were planning to harm someone,
I would have to report that.
Hi, baby.
are you awol?
Jess, did you run?
I need a place to rest.
Why?
aren't you on the same side?
Skynet does not believe you like I do.
believe?
what do you believe?
you will lead me to the Connors.
stay there.
there's no one here.
where the hell are you?
where the hell am I supposed to be?
we just got robbed.
you were what?
diamonds, cash, credit cards, I. D.S. They cleaned us out.
my leather jacket's gone.
so is most of the food. - Human.
if those I. D.S fall into the wrong hands...
listen, head downtown.
I'll call you with an exact location in half an hour.
who was that?
real life calling.
you don't always have to answer.
I tried it ignoring it all last time around and the whole freaking town blew up.
you're a funny man.
Yeah. Yeah, that's the first thing people say who know me. Funny Derek.
what's wrong with the system?
why didn't it beep or do whatever the hell you set it up to do?
Riley climbed out John's window.
the alarm would had to have been turned off for her to do that.
Thanks.
you gave her the code?
we were up late watching TV. She was supposed to reset it.
and somehow your master plan went awry.
mom
John, our I. D.S are out there. Our names, our faces.
fake addresses, fake names. Nothing can be traced to this house.
no? What if the police find who did this? Where do you think that trail leads to?
if our I. D.S made it into the system linked to this address
canada. We should move to Canada.
saw your door was open. I thought I'd bring you guys some
Oh, my god, what happened? I'll go call Trevor.
no, John's been having some trouble with some kids at school.
Seriously? - Yeah.
you know how stupid kids can be.
anyway, you'll know soon enough. We're just on our way to seeheir parents.
all right, well, if you change your mind
I'll call you.
what am I supposed to do?
I'd start with a broom.
come on, Rita.
look, I got the county breathing down my neck.
we can't have a backlog like this.
I'll get it done.
today.
I needed it two weeks ago.
it's my son.
he took off this morning with the neighbor's car and my credit cards.
we'll call you right away if he attempts a charge, Miss Baum.
is this a good number to reach you?
Yes, thank you.
if you knew what was going on with the girl, why didn't you say something?
to you?
to me, to him, to somebody.
I've always made my position on security very clear.
no one likes a nag.
I'm looking for this girl.
you see these people, sir?
these people are real.
these are the real people, and they were all here before you.
I'm her uncle.
and I'm Angelina Jolie.
get to the back of the line.
I know that chick.
so what do you want her for? She owe you money?
I'm her uncle.
you're not her uncle. You're a cop.
I'm not a cop.
you gonna hurt her? - Yes.
what about her brother, you gonna hurt him too?
her brother? - Yeah.
John Baum or whatever.
another prize.
is that him?
Yeah, that's him.
let's take a ride.
who is it?
Los Angeles police department.
hold on.
I'm just trying to catch up on last night's game.
you know who won?
Steelers, Mr. Ellison.
could you open the door please?
Yeah.
you James Ellison?
Yeah.
Mr. Ellison, I'm placing you under arrest for the murder of Peter Meyers.
what?
you have the right to remain silent.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you.
do you understand these rights as I've read them to you, sir?
Yeah, I know my rights.
I just don't know what the hell you're talking about.
please put your hands against the wall, sir.
now, Mr. Ellison.
come on, Moishe, open up.
who are they?
new customers.
everything we do, without exception, can be seen many ways in the eyes of god, or nature, or whatever you want to call it.
someone came into your home.
someone took things that were rightfully yours.
the torah says, "lo tikom ve'lo titor."
no revenge, no retribution.
on the other hand, it also says, "ayan tachat ayn."
an eye for an eye.
and then, of course, we have the story of the brothers of Nablus
we came here looking for our diamonds.
can you help us or not?
I wish I could.
but lately, business is dry as a bone.
I called four other fences.
they said you were the busiest man on the block this week.
well, nothing you'd be interested in.
show us.
okay.
these...
I bought in the last two days.
all from legitimate sources.
this one's ours.
young lady, even if those were your diamonds-- and they're not
there's no way you could tell that with the naked eye.
we have machines for that.
so are these.
we don't want any trouble.
tell us where you got 'em and we're gone.
you think I can put a face to every diamond in this stack?
just a face from the last 24 hours.
Moishe, please.
all right.
it's so early in the week for trouble.
but it's not for you. It's for Jesse.
his name's Ostrowski. Walter Ostrowski.
where do we find him?
he work out of Toluca Lake, or so he says. I just buy the stones.
and this Ostrowski, you're sure he's the guy who sold you these?
I shall not lie.
if you're so into god, what are you doing here?
hashem has a plan for us all.
for me, diamonds.
who's Jesse?
he came back with me.
he handled the diamonds.
one of them killed him.
do you want some gum? - No.
you sure? It's cinnamon.
would it kill you to try and make a little conversation?
no, it wouldn't kill me.
funny. You're funny.
in your own sort of cop way.
I'm not a cop.
you're not a cop. You're not an uncle.
you're just some guy who wants to kick the crap out of little miss bitch and her brother.
just some guy.
but why?
she try to kill you too?
Yes.
well, this is gonna be fun.
I can't believe they stole your food.
freaking amateurs, man.
I know, right?
what do you think they're gonna do with two-week old mae turkey?
bet your mom freaked out, huh?
Yeah, on me.
on you? Why on you?
the alarm code.
did I forget? - Yeah, you did.
I didn't actually see it happen.
like, I wasn't here, but I'm pretty sure this
Yeah, I'm positive. This is where they busted her.
I heard the cops talking about it when they brought her in.
you are so buying me these pink and whites, and that is all there is to it.
have you seen this girl?
I'm looking for this girl.
I'm so sorry, John. I can't believe I did that.
don't worry about it. It wouldn't have stopped a break-in.
might have stopped the picnic, but
so I know you want to find them and everything, but this is getting a little shady.
does she hate me now?
don't sweat it. It's a long list.
you're not gonna get what you want this way.
you should try being warmer to people.
they might be more open, you know, to talk to you.
I love this stuff.
that's my bad.
that's the guy. That's definitely the guy.
what am I doing here, detective?
you've been on my side of the table. You know how this works.
I ask a question, you answer it.
why am I being questioned?
you tell me. Who's Peter Meyers?
I don't know Peter Meyers.
you killed him.
killed him? No.
Yes. I've got a witness. Saw the murder.
recognized you from the news a few weeks ago.
recognized me? From the news?
the news 20 of your guys dead... you the sole survivor.
by now you're drowning in guilt, I'm guessing.
throw yourself an anchor.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about surviving, Mr. Ellison.
I'm talking about the everyday, walk around pain of surviving when others have not.
I wanna talk to my lawyer.
okay. Sure.
I meant to ask you. Why did you steal hi - what? - Meyers' clothes. You were naked when you killed him.
I told you, it wasn't me.
smart.
your alibi isn't exactly ironclad, Jim.
unless, of course, you got a twin brother I don't know about.
you got a twin brother I don't know about?
Dr. Ostrowski's in with patients all afternoon.
would you like to make an appointment?
we'll just take a second.
excuse me!
uh, yes.
I think you have something that belongs to us.
uh, do I know you?
no, but we have a friend in common, someone in the diamond district.
um, why don't we, um, talk in my office.
it's... just across the hall.
please, please, don't kill me.
Where's our stuff?
what stuff?
passports, I. D.S, credit cards.
leather jacket.
everything you stole from our house.
your house? I don't-- okay, okay, okay.
tell Moishe I'll pay him. I'll give you the money today.
it's upstairs in my office.
pay Moishe for what?
everything I owe him.
please. Just don't kill me.
let him go. - Why?
he's not the guy who robbed us.
and go get Moishe's money.
that's why we're here, running a collections agency for your fence?
why we're here is because our security system didn't work.
why we're here is because that boy behaves less like John Connor and more like John Baum every day.
that boy, my son, has been through more than you'll ever know.
right back at you.
my friends.
is this what you're looking for?
you do something for me, I do something for you. It's business.
this is business.
please, I just buy the stones.
who sold you our diamonds?
okay, okay, his name is Tristan Dewitt.
he lives in Reseda.
not good enough. - It's true. I swear!
he's a friend of my cousin's, a punk. That's all I know.
you killed Liko.
not yet.
you're never gonna find them like this.
do you even know how many people live in L. A.County?
an employee at the grocery store saw them shopping there on more than one occasion.
it's highly likely they live within a one-mile radius.
I'm looking for this girl.
this is stupid.
just take me back to the halfway house.
did you hear me?
I am done hanging out with a creepy stalker.
I don't even know your name.
I just came with you because I wanted to get back at that bitch.
and I thought you were kind of cute. But you know what?
you're not cute.
you're freakin' silence of the lambs.
this is kidnapping. You know that, right? I could have you arrested.
what are you doing? Why are we stopping?
freak!
you're blocking the sun.
had an interesting morning with our friend Moishe.
he's dropping your name pretty freely in front of people who don't need to be hearing your name.
well, he's your fence.
he likes you better.
I'll have a talk with him.
help me out, will you?
how long are you planning on keeping this up?
what? - You know what, all this.
well, I'm certainly gonna try to get through today without you spoiling it for me.
the sun sets at 5: 47. I'm not missing that sucker.
I'm not missing one of those again.
I'm looking for this girl.
why are you looking for her? Has she done something?
she's my niece.
you--you look really familiar.
common face.
have you seen my niece?
I haven't. I'm sorry.
the house next door, it's on the market.
you're listed as the contact.
that house has been rented.
thank you for your time.
wow, you guys really know how to party.
my mom's not much of a cook.
uh, what about cameron?
she's not really into food.
you gonna get that?
no, if they need me, they'll call my cell.
Oh, right, because you're so important.
Hello, Baum residence.
Yeah, just a sec. Here's John. It's your neighbor.
Thanks.
Yeah, hey, Kacy. What's up?
Hey, John. I don't mean to bother you, but there was a guy here looking for your sister.
when? - Just now.
and I did not get a good vibe from him at all.
something was just off, you know?
what's the matter, John? What's wrong?
out. We gotta get out now. - Why? Who's there?
no, it's okay, I'll get rid of him.
no, now. - I'll get rid of him.
I'm looking for this girl.
she's my niece.
um, sorry, I don't know her.
wish I could be more help. Good luck finding her.
how do you like your new house?
Oh, uh, it's really nice, I love it.
excuse me, what do you think you're doing?
Hello, you can't just come into people's homes.
Hello, are you listening to me?
what is wrong with you?
you're not in these photographs.
maybe because I was the one taking them.
look, if you don't leave, I'm calling the police.
thank you for your time.
we were too supportive.
that was the problem in a nutshell.
your son says he wants to be a filmmaker.
you tell him, "son, movies are great."
I love going to see them.
but that's pie in the sky.
you need a salary job.
thank you for not going to the police about this.
we just want our things back.
"come live at home," I told him.
until you can get on your feet.
and every time I bring up the idea of him getting a salary job, he's got this project to work on, or that short film he's producing.
he's had his troubles, but he's a good boy.
he's not a boy, Donna.
he's a 34-year-old man.
he lives with us, working in a video store, robbing people's homes.
video store?
saturn video on, uh, La Brea.
and who knows if that's true when every other word out of his mouth is a lie.
does your son have any friends who might know where he is?
anyone at the video store?
Dave. Another boy wonder.
this is a very curious turn of events, Mr. Ellison.
I'm innocent.
there's an eyewitness.
it wasn't me.
the witness is quite sure.
as I would be if I had seen what he'd seen.
is there something you want to tell me, James?
something only I would believe?
not here.
I'll be in touch.
miss Weaver.
thank you for believing me.
what good is faith if we don't use it?
where are we going?
nowhere. Anywhere.
that guy isn't really Cameron's uncle, is he?
because then he'd be your uncle.
he's nobody's uncle.
then why is he after Cameron? Is she a criminal or something?
no, he is, all right?
well, what if he comes back?
that's not how-- that's not how he works.
John, I don't understand.
look, that guy is really dangerous. That's all you need to know. Really dangerous.
well, I got rid of him, didn't I?
I stared him down, and off he went.
you got lucky.
Oh, ease up, Squinchie. "Lucky" is my middle name.
lucky riley Dawson.
in that sentence, "lucky" was your first name.
whatever. Stickler.
admit it, I was a brave, spooky ninja.
it was totally badass.
say it! Just say it.
it was badass.
I know!
fool's errands and fathers of Nablus.
it's been a great day. - Brothers.
what? - Brothers of Nablus.
genesis. Chapter 34.
you memorized the bible?
jacob's daughter Dinah is raped by Shechem, prince of Nablus.
he falls in love with her.
Shecm's father comes to Jacob and strikes a bargain to allow his son to marry Dinah.
that's brave of him.
jacob says yes, on the condition that all the men in Shechem's town be circumcised.
and everybody gets what they want.
three days later, while Shechem's men were still in pain from the circumcision, Dinah's brothers rode into the city and killed them all.
that's your kind of story.
Yes. My kind of story.
hello.
miss Baum? - Yeah.
this is Dan Deffenbaugh calling to let you know somebody just attempted a charge with your card.
where?
at a bowling alley in Van Nuys. Alien Lanes.
match FOUND RECENT CHARGES: ALIEN...
sorry to keep you waiting.
I just have a few more questions, then we'll get you out of here.
so you say Mr. Ellison was completely nude when he killed Meyers.
I already told you that.
and that he killed him with his bare hands?
didn't use a weapon?
he strangled him.
did Meyers fight back?
a little, but the other guy was too strong.
how so?
snapped his neck like it was nothing.
a toothpick.
where was Mr. Ellison before he killed Mr. Meyers?
out on the road.
the road.
the road, the street, asphalt.
anything unusual about the street?
who cares about the street?
are you lying about the street?
it was like, uh-- it was like a crater.
a pothole. - No.
it was like a complete dent in the road.
so Mr. Ellison just appeared out of thin air?
there was a light. - What kind of a light?
bluish purple.
it made, like, a cracking sound.
like lightning.
so Mr. Ellison emerged from this...
energy bubble.
I never said anything about a bubble.
but there was a bubble, correct?
so to be clear, you saw Mr. Ellison...
materialize out of this energy bubble, completely nude, walk to Peter Meyers, snap his neck, steal his clothes, and then disappear.
I know what I saw.
thank you for your assistance.
nice.
okay, so it's 1863 and Abraham Lincoln is on the train to Gettysburg.
then the train breaks down.
some small Pennsylvania town.
so he's got to stay there overnight.
the only problem... town's overrun with zombies. Shew!
we shoot it on location, in Gettysburg, 35 millimeter.
dude, with what money?
what money?
do you know how much we made just off these right here?
put it down.
that bag you're holding, it's mine.
uh, not anymore it isn't.
this place is closed, ladies.
unless you want to get arrested for trespassing, I suggest you get the hell out.
my jacket, give it to me.
come and get it.
come and give it to me. - And the bag.
there's a credit card missing.
we used it on the arcades. We'll pay you back.
Where's the other guy?
what other guy?
stay here.
they knew where we live.
No!
you know those guys out there?
were you with them when they robbed the house?
you were never there. You were never here. You never saw me.
you don't know what happed here. Understand?
if you say anything to anybody about what happened here, I'll hunt you down.
I'll kill you.
now you wait five minutes, then you run.
understood?
clear? - Yeah, clear.
you're free to go.
what?
the witness is a nutjob. The judge kicked his statement in five minutes.
we'll have you out of here in an hour.
sorry you had to go through all this.
that's it?
you're a smart guy, Jim.
take "yes" for an answer.
good luck out there.
you said you were gonna have a talk with him.
I did. It was short.
what were you gonna say to him?
well, you know me.
funny Derek.
funny Derek.
how was the sunset?
never better.
you never really struck me as the type to stalk your ex-wife.
I'm sorry. I just, um...
I had an urge to see the house.
see something familiar.
weird, I know.
you do realize you don't live here anymore.
Yeah.
fancy ride.
no wonder we keep losing people to civilian life.
company car.
they lease it for me.
I have to tell you, you don't look so well.
Yeah, I'm not.
I just, um...
I don't know, I...
I miss it.
I miss my old life.
James, this is a really weird time to start into all that.
no, no, I don't mean that.
things have changed.
and I just... I didn't.
you're not making sense.
come on, come inside.
paul can make coffee. We'll talk about it.
Thanks, but I didn't come over for that.
Yes, you did.
this was the wrong thing for me to do.
I don't live here anymore.
it was the righthing to do.
just five years too late.
call me the next time you wanna see something familiar.
I'll send you a picture.
who was it?
they won't be back.
place looks good.
Yeah, well, I think we pretty much got evything back to how it was.
we?
Riley helped. So how'd you find 'em?
wait Derek's fence, or what?
you can't bring people here anymore, John.
what? She had nothing to do with this.
no, you did.
she just made it worse.
she's a security risk.
Really? She's never tried to kill me.
and you know that this has nothing to do with Riley.
or the rules. Or the security of this house.
you're pissed off because I found someone I actually like spending time with and it's not you.
you think I don't want you to have a normal life?
no, I don't.
Hey, we didn't choose this, John. It chose us.
and there's nothing either of us can do about it.
my job is to protect you.
and you can hate me as much as you want, but I will keep ing that as long as I'm here.
then why didn't you protect me when I was killing Sarkissian?
why didn't you protect me when I had my hands around his throat?
why didn't you protect me from that?
it's a moray.
they're nocturnal predators.
does it have a name?
no, it doesn't. Please, sit.
I read the witness report.
so did I.
he comes across as crazy, doesn't he?
who wouldn't?
you, if you'd tell me the truth.
there was another one of you, wasn't there?
a twin?
Yes.
where is it now?
I don't know.
why did it come?
I think I'm being tested.
like job?
you know the story?
he suffered worse than any man before him.
everything he loved was taken away.
everything but his life.
but he didn't renounce god.
and god spared him.
so who spared you?
where did you get those credit cards?
I don't know.
Yes, you do.
she said... she would find me.
she said she would kill me.
I promise you, she won't.
Dr. boyd sherman, child psychologist, family therapist.
what's his link to skynet--friend or foe?
Hey, baby.
are you awol?
Jesse, did you run from the war?
I need a place to rest.
what's next?
we'll come back down here
and bring something with us to destroy it.
I'm gonna be sick.
what's wrong with her?
I don't know. She's-- she's burning up.
I'm fine.
is she pregnant?
why in the hell would you even ask that?
kacy vomited when she was pregnant.
you're vomiting. it's morning.
that's when it happens. - Just shut up.
it's a bug or something.
stomach flu or something.
we'll be home soon, okay?
wait.
how do you feel?
how do I look?
like crap.
I wish I felt that good.
what's that?
it's rehydration fluid.
drink one cup every half hour or right after you vomit.
no, no, no. Where are you going?
we have to go back now.
back where? - mexico.
there's thermite in the garage. We need to burn cromartie's body.
cromartie's dead. you destroyed his chip.
you have to incinerate him, john. It's the only way to be sure.
he's buried in a hole in the middle of the mexican desert,
and his chip has been obliterated. I think we're pretty
safe? It's not safe.
Oh, god, she's starting to sound like you.
she's right.
I need to see you. now.
bring a gun.
I was over at the shopping mall this morning, right?
and I just-- i-i don't know.
I can't stop eating the crappy chinese food in the food court there. So I'm there,
and I'm just waiting for my food,
and I look across the way, and I see him.
I just see him.
you see him who?
Fischer. I see fischer.
who's fischer?
I don't--i don't know who you're talking about.
you do. you know him.
Charles fischer, sent back from the future,
and he works for the machines.
and he's gonna die.
what are you doing?
feeling what it's like to get away from it all.
I don't think you are.
what do you mean?
if by feelings you mean emotions,
I'm pretty sure you still don't have any of those.
and if by feeling you mean what it feels like
to have the wind blow through your toes or your hair...
I'm pretty sure you can't feel that either.
I don't think you understand how we work.
I have sensation. I feel.
I wouldn't be worth much if I couldn't feel.
so go through this again.
I've been-- I've gone through it again.
one more time.
I told you. I'm at the mall
just skip to where you follow this man To the parking garage and hit him with a brick.
he's a grey, derek.
at least tell me you remember the greys.
of course I remember the greys.
they were traitors. the worked for skynet.
helped the trip-eights act more human.
you don't remember him?
he was on the top of the list.
tell him!
tell him who you are and why you're here!
I don't know what you're talking about.

that's my license.
what are you doing here, fischer?
I was looking for an omega . 321 movement.
there's a secondhand store.
tin cans didn't send him back here to fix watches.
I think we all know that.
why don't you save us the trouble
and tell us the truth?
why are you here?
I'm paul stewart, I live On blackburn avenue.
your name is fischer. - no.
you work for skynet. - skynet? no.

I'm not.
I need you to be sure. - Sure of what?
him. - I am sure. you don't trust me?
it's not that I don't trust you. it's
I knew the greys.
Jesse, I knew them just like you did.
they were war criminals. we caught, what, four of them?
right, but we couldn't find fischer.
they kept him hidden. he was too valuable.
you really don't remember?
listen, if he is who you say he is,
then he deserves whatever is gonna happen to him in that room,
but not until he tells us who he is And what he's doing here.
do you understand?
he is who I say he is. - I want to hear him say it.
he will.
I'll show you.
Where's the rest of him?
it's not here.
not possible. we destroyed his chip.
he didn't walk out of here, but he's gone.
there's only one other person who knew about this.
and only one other person crazy enough to dig him up.
you hungry?
not hungry.
you a vegetarian?
no, I just--i don't know what's in that.
cheeseburger's in that. Eat.
Where's your friend?
out.
I'm not who she thinks I am.
I sure hope not.
I fix watches.

so I decided to go to bern to learn...

that's a nice story.
you don't believe me.
I've told a few myself.

it's complicated.
well, i-i-i know complication. I'm a watchmaker.
it's a-- it's a watch joke.

she says that you know me,
and--and clearly you don't know me.
there's something wrong with her.

d-did you hear what I just said?
it's prison ink.
Where'd you do time?
I haven't done Any time.
Yes, you have.

everything's okay. Don't worry about it.
can I help you?
I was waiting.

you came to my office over a month ago,
and you said your son needed help-- Therapy.
I never saw Either of you again.
wait. dr. sherman, please.
I've had some bad luck with shrinks.
well, you could stop calling them shrinks.
that might help.
sorry. - it's okay.
my assistant will be here tomorrow morning at 7: 00. Make an appointment.
I'm here now.
Sarah, make an appointment, please.
we'll see what we can do.
I've been sick... Flu or something.
I'm exhausted. I can't sleep, and when I do, I have dreams.
nightmares, actually. I walk in my sleep.
where are you walking to?
what do you mean?
I mean, where do you go when you walk?
I'm chasing someone, or I'm being chased.
but where do you go?
out. I get the hell out.
you're here. come on in.
there are many things I don't understand.
like what?
the tortoise.
what tortoise?
it was on its back by the side of the road in mexico.
your mother turned it over.
she was helping it.
I know. but why?
cause that's what we do.
when we, uh... When we see something That's, uh, in pain, or in trouble, or whatever, We try and help it.
empathy.
something like that.
but not everyone would turn the tortoise over.
no.
some would just leave it there.
some would probably drive over it and crush it.
Yeah, I guess they would.
is that what you'd do?
it didn't seem like much of a threat.
we're not built to be cruel.
Yeah, that's one for cyborgs.
Yes.
that's one for us.
what are you doing? - The body is gone.
what? - Cromartie's body is gone.
that's impossible.
you are the only one who knew where we buried it.
we need it. we have to destroy it.
what would I possibly want with it?
he's lying.
you don't know that.
please, John.
if you know, you better tell me right now.
I don't know.
I don't know.
let him go. - Why?
he's telling the truth.
we could find out for certain.
let him go.
sorry.
what the hell?
he doesn't want to tell us who he is.
I brought proof. - Proof?
please, please don't hurt me. Don't hurt me, please.
that's up to him.
who's he? - Who are you?
uh, my name is charlie fischer.
you were at my-- my job-- S. r.f.
uh, we do seismic retrofitting.
I'm a service technician. That's all. I'm--i'm nobody.
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
tell him who you are.
I've already told you who I am.
this is a trick, some crazy trick,
and you're all in on it, and you too.
what do you want from me?!
I want you... To tell me... The truth!
Oh, god!
if he is who you say he is-- - He is!
all right, fine. he is.
we need to know what he's doing here.
unless he's awol, like you.
he's not.
not this guy, not charles fischer.
he's been sent back By them for a reason.
you need to beat the hell out of him.
you need to get him to talk.
no, please. Please, please.
I'm sorry, Really
don't-- don't hurt the boy. Don't
some people, you can beat them and beat them,
and they'll take it. Whatever pain you give them, They absorb it,
like it was theirs all along, And all you're doing is giving it back to them.
you see, deep down, They hate themselves,
and they use that hate to eat the pain.
see, we were all good once.
we all loved ourselves once,
as young men Trying to get through the day,
or as kids Playing in the park.
okay.
stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.
my name is charles fischer.
I'm charles fischer. Now let him go.
he's got nothing to do with this.
just let him go.
this is impossible!
can't you people see that this is insane?!
why are you here? Why did they send you back?
they didn't. I'm not here on a mission.
nobody comes back without a mission.
this is my reward.
when the bombs dropped, I was locked up in pelican bay.
solitary confinement.
life sentence.
if I hadn't been in prison,
I never would've made it through judgment day.
once they got their hands on me,
it was either I teach them Everything I learned inside
or say good-bye.
and what'd you learn?
I learned what makes people tick.
so the fever that brought on the dreams
was caused by something you ate, you think, in mexico.
Yes.
what were you doing in mexico?
vacation.
family vacation?
Yes.
has anything happened since I saw you last?
what do you mean?
I mean, have you suffered a trauma?
um, has there been a crisis in the family,
something more between you and john since I've seen you last?
I came to you for help in understanding my dreams.
well, the problem is, Without knowing the details of your life,
I'm not sure what I can tell you beyond generalities.
I can tell you that dreams tend to mirror The central conflict in the dreamer.
would it be accurate to say That the central conflict in your life is your son?
Yes.
and your daughter, You have less conflict with.
it's different with her.
what is? Conflict, uh, type of conflict,
the--the nature of your relationship, what?
everything.
specifically.
I don't want to talk about her.
then why are you here?
I mean, you come in here Pretending to want to talk about your dreams,
and refusing to talk about john and cameron,
which, in my opinion, Is what your obsession with the three dots Is all about.
so if you only want to talk about One of those dots,
there's not much I can do.
I have no one else to talk to.
nothing is going to happen in here Until you decide to be honest.
you seem surprised.
judgment day...
machines...
you have no idea what you'd do.
what's the hardest decision you've ever had to make?
whether to stay with Rebecca
or take a chance on Christine?
whether to ask for time off For grandfather's funeral
because you're too afraid you'll be fired if you just take it?
you think You know who you are?
you don't have a clue.
can't you just tell them what they want to know?
what does it matter now?
you're here. you're safe.
are you?
no, he's playing with us, Making us think he's weak.
he's not weak.
how do you know?
I know, all right? I know.
you may not remember, but I know.
he is the worst of them. he's the worst.
he needs to die, derek.
forget why he's here.
forget whatever the mission is.
he just needs to die.
what did he do?
Jess, what did he do to you?
there was a raid on a bunker.
metal was everywhere.
they took out our command,
killed everyone over 30, Killed the children.
they took the prisoners to this place.
he was there.
he said he was gonna teach them how to talk to people,
how to get information from people, How to be people.
it was a kind of Perverse theater, like...
like he was teaching them.
how long did it go on?
weeks. Months.
there were drugs...
and starvation.
and he talked to you...
for hours... For days...
just to break you down,
just to get to your in
to get to you.
how'd you get out?
I don't know. You never told me.
what?
it wasn't me fischer had, baby.
it was you.
go to hell. Go to hell.
you don't remember.
I can't believe you don't remember.
but it was you.
my name is derek reese,
first lieutenant, 132nd s. o.c.
Yeah, well, good for you. - Not for you.
I told you I'm not on a mission.
I don't care.
Oh, yeah, you remember. you remember now.
I was wondering how long that was gonna take.
no, I don't remember.
but she does,
and that's good enough for me.
so you gonna kill me?
not you.
Oh, god. thank you. Thank you. thank you.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
I wasn't sleeping.
just needed to close my eyes for a few minutes.
how you feeling?
what does this mean to you?
I keep seeing it in my dreams, john. It means something.
mom, you're tired. you've been sick.
chasing killer robots will do that to you.
we couldn't find cromartie's body.
it wasn't there. it's gone.
he doesn't have it.
are you sure?
I'm sure.
Cromartie was in my dreams. It's connected. it's all connected.
mom, you had a dream.
it was my fault.
what was your fault?
Cromartie-- I led him to you.
what are you talking about?
there was this kid, a boy...
in the bowling alley. He was with the guys who broke into our house, And I sh
I knew what I had to do, john. I didn't do it. I let him go.
Cromartie must've found him.
we're not murderers.
you're not.
tell that to the boy.
I'm sure he's dead.
we have to find that body, john.
you don't think he'll...talk-- Young fischer.
we had to let him go.
he's not the monster we just buried.
let's hope he doesn't become one.
do you remember any of it?
even a flash?
no, nothing.
it was all we talked about, derek...
what he'd done,
how you were gonna find him one day.
you were obsessed.
it was a trauma. you've blocked it.
maybe, maybe not.
maybe--maybe it never happened to me.
Derek, I was there.
maybe I came from a future where it never happened,
and now you've come from a future where it did.
is that possible?
ever since I've been back here, I've--i've done... Things.
I've-- I've changed things.
maybe I changed the future.
that's why we're here, isn't it? To change the future.
do you think there's a version of the future Where we're not together?
no.
Charles fischer? - Yeah.
FBI, department of homeland security.
need you to come with us please.
two nights ago, you entered the building unauthorized At 4: 16 a. m.
what were you doing here?
that's a mistake.
two nights ago? no. I wasn't there.
I would have no reason to be there at that time.
computers don't lie, mr. fischer.
at 4: 23, Seven minutes after you entered the building,
there was an unauthorized access To the computer networking system.
that wasn't me.
this system allows user access
to all primary military-industrial complex computer systems.
I'm telling you that this is all a big mistake.
I do seismic retrofitting.
I don't even know how to access a computer system. Why would I do that?
I don't know, mr. fischer. You tell me.
why would you install a roving back door Into those computer systems?
one that we can't dismantle so far.
you want to tell us how to do that as ll?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wasn't there.
what happened to you? you look a little banged up.
want to explain that?
I don't know if I can.
try.
so...
what is it you wanted to show me?
we need to learn how they work...
how to fight them.
we can't allow history to repeat itself,
not when we have the power to stop it.
it's up to us now...
the two of us.
yes... It is.
what am I doing here?
I don't know.
it's a waste of time. you just lie and lie.
it's a waste of time. I just lie and lie.
don't you have things to do?
Yes, I do. I have things to do.
I should get back to work.
whatever happened flipped a switch.
you were gonna kill me. - I'm fixed now. Everything's perfect.
I'm not sure you can control it.
I won't let that happen again.
I lived in Mexico. That's where we are going.
I can get her to tell me the truth. - Stay away from her.
I don't think I can do this anymore. What if I want out?
there's no out.
you are here to keep John Connor away from her.
Riley!
you shouldn't nest in the chimney.
you're migratory. You need to find a mate.
that's a window, bird.
what am I going to do with you?
a bird in a chimney is a fire hazard.
I'm not supposed to kill you, but you can't stay here.
go.
I was wondering when we'd see you again.
they make you rest a couple days.
does it help?
not really.
is there any more somewhere?
Yeah. downstairs under the sink.
I just needed a minute alone.
sorry.
she say something?
she asked about it.
to be nice, I think.
well, it's nobody's business.
well, it shouldn't have happened here.
or not at all.
it's in the past.
people don't forget about the past.
I'm not saying "forget it.
I'm saying it's in the past.
sight's off.
give me.
it's nice being able to waste bullets on apples.
Yeah. It's nice being able to waste apples.
april 21st, 2011.
I never asked you for judgment day.
your judgment day.
you're right about the sight.
april 21st, 2011. That's mine.
what's yours?
whatever mine is. It might not be anymore.
so don't fret about it, love.
we'll know when it happens.
I want you to help me with something.
didn't I just help with something this morning in the shower?
there's a guy. He's got some information I need.
so ask him.
not that kind of guy. Not that kind of information.
Skynet?
I'm not here to stop the war, sweetie.
I'm here to win it.
John Connor. - John Connor.
you keep saying that.
but I don't know what it means.
I'm the one living with him.
how's that working out for you?
is the metal alive and well? Sarah running you around?
I'm here. I'm asking you.
either help me with my plan or show me some progress on yours.
okay. What do you need?
there was a stack of research here on that lawyer.
the one who set up the drone shell company.
Derek took it.
when? - While you were gone.
so he's chasing it down?
I don't know. - He should keep me in the loop.
it's my loop.
you've been distracted.
I was kidnapped.
which is distracting.
talk to me about Riley.
what happened the day she tried to kill herself?
she was very upset. John could tell.
she had a bruise on her face.
who gave her the bruise?
John thought it was her foster dad.
she said it was a door. - Liar. Then what?
Riley cut her wrists like this.
she almost bled to death.
do you think it was her foster dad?
it's hard to say.
we don't know much about Riley.
we should know more.
I know where she lives.
I'll go talk to her foster parents.
I'll go. My loop.
I killed a bird.
not the one in the chimney.
I thought you should know.
a bird did that?
no. I did that. look.
the bird experienced an involuntary moment of my fingers.
it was fragile.
wiggle your fingers.
Yeah, there's damage, but it's buried pretty deep in there.
I don't know how it happened.
it was probably during a fight.
you're not designed to fight other machines.
all right, look, maybe I could swap this out.
but it's not like we just have spare parts lying around.
you're supposed to burn the endos.
not all of them.
says who?
you.
what, future me?
future you.
Yeah, why doesn't that surprise me?
I have damage to my hand and now you're able to fix it.
future John has better information than you do.
Jesse, she's gonna kill me. - What? Who?
her. Cameron. - What happened? What did it do?
I saw something. The metal.
the metal. - She cut her wrists.
why did it cut itself?
I don't know. but I saw the metal.
and she knows that I saw it.
sweetie, if she knew you saw, you'd be dead.
I can't go back there.
I wonder what's wrong with it.
has it been acting strange? - strange?
everything she does is strange.
did you not hear me?
I can't go back there. - Of course you can, dear.
you put one foot in front of the other.
master your fear. Remember the mission.
there's gotta be another way.
trust me. There is only one way.
I won't let cameron hurt you.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
here's one from my private stash.
Kay doesn't buy the kind with sugar or caffeine but
what's the point?
I hear you.
must've been a shock, what happened to Riley.
what's John say?
getting anything out of that boy is like pulling teeth.
but he did say that she seemed upset that day and, uh,
she had a bruise on her face.
bruise?
I'm a patient person, but I swear, there have been times...
kids. they know how to push your buttons.
just saying if someone was to lose their temper...
get physical...
if by someone, you mean me...
these things do happen.
these things do happen.
but not the way you're thinking.
not--not by a long shot.
that girl assaulted my wife.
went absolutely nuts.
started yelling about the world burning up
and bleached skulls or some such nonsense.
she said that?
I wanted to report it. Kay wouldn't let me.
but now I wish I had with you coming around here accusing us.
I'm not accusing anybody.
first your kid drops out of school, then so does she.
next thing you know, we got a guidance counselor at our door.
even she thinks john's a bad influence.
a guidance counselor.
she had a lot to say about you and your family.
I was willing to dismiss it as gossip...
until I met you.
do you have her name?
keep john away from riley.
she's been through enough.
okay, clench your fist.
and, okay, now, fingers straight.
okay.
you feel any different?
Yes.
are you all fixed?
I don't know.
well, just try not to kill any more birds.
you're ahead of schedule.
with what?
what you need to learn.
I know it's just recon, derek,
but I can't have you running off like that.
I gotta go.
miss Wilson, thanks for coming.
ms. Baum.
so your family's moved around a lot, I take it.
unfortunately, my job requires it.
it's been difficult on john, hard for him to make friends.
I can imagine.
that's why I was so happy when Riley first came home with him.
I didn't realize she was so troubled.
foster kids like these, it's hard to tell.
a lot of them come from broken homes, abuse.
where does she come from?
an orphan out of Riverside.
her parents died in a fire in a meth lab.
it's tragic.
I met her foster dad.
he said you talked to him about us.
I was curious about why it happened in your home.
in your bathroom.
I have no idea.
my main concern is that the girl get help.
of course.
I've only known her a short while, but I've grown fond of her.
it's funny, she thinks you don't like her.
it's not the case.
so you're the one who took her to the hospital afterwards?
no. I was out of town.
so there was no adult supervision in the household at the time.
John's uncle stays with us sometimes.
Yeah, Riley's mentioned the uncle.
uncle Derek.
John's uncle on his father's side.
we're not involved if that's what you're getting at.
not getting at anything. Just trying to paint a picture.
do you think it's wise to have an unattached,
adult male hanging around a pretty,
teenage girl who's obviously so desperate for attention?
what, did she say something about him?
she might have. If she did, it's confidential.
miss Wilson, look, John's a good kid.
whatever's going on with this girl, he's trying to be her friend.
he's trying to help her.
like by taking her to Mexico?
Mexico?
Riley said she and John took a trip to mexico.
now, I don't have to tell you that transporting a minor across
the border without her parents' permission is a federal offense.
I didn't know.
obviously, I will talk to my son.
miss Baum, I'm not out to get anyone here.
my sense is that you're a decent person, a hardworking mom.
I'm a big believer in keeping your own house in order.
so why don't I let you handle this your way...
for now.
I'd appreciate that.
consider it done.
keep taking the antibiotics.
that's it? -Why? Is there something else you need, sweetie?
no. -'Cause we really could use the room.
what are you doing?
I'm looking up a restaurant address.
are you hungry?
Yeah. but, uh, this is actually for derek.
that Kaliba lawyer he's been tracking,
the guy's got a booth reserved there.
not an ideal location for derek to acquire his target.
it's underground, and according to this, crowded with friendly people.
hard to dispose of the body.
I don't think that's gonna be necessary.
Derek's just gonna follow him and grab him and press him about Kaliba.
to see if it's connected to skynet?
exactly. - It's going to be necessary.
I'll make you a sandwich.
wait. why?
you're hungry.
why don't we let hungry be my problem?
sometimes it's nice to have help.
how's the hand?
not a problem.
aren't you supposed to be really good at self-repair?
Yes.
but sometimes it's nice to have help.
Yes.
well, I'll make my own sandwich.
this one taken?
no.
you buying?
Nope.
I could, uh, introduce you to Davy.
I'm here for business, not pleasure, thanks.
my mistake.
that one, huh?
what's he do anyway?
lawyer.
he ever buy you a drink?
once or twice.
how'd the muscle feel about that?
they very much enjoy the show.
it's nice having an audience.
it's you coming over later, right?
Yeah, we'll just-- just watch a movie or something.
OK, i'll see you soon
I just had an interesting conversation with a guidance counselor from your old school.
Oh, i-i, uh, I forgot to send in the quarterly home schooling thing.
actually, that didn't come up.
the main topic of conversation was Riley.
what about her?
she has a lot to say about you and me and Derek and...Mexico.
school counselor told you this?
all those things.
from a stranger's lips to my own ears, john.
no, that doesn't make any sense.
and I talked to her foster dad.
I would've talked to him longer, but he asked me to leave.
he thinks we're the reason she tried to kill herself.
because of mexico?
because riley had a violent breakdown
about bleached skulls and the end of the world.
I haven't told her anything.
I don't believe you.
well, I swear to god I've said nothing.
I'll talk to her.
might be too late for that.
well, what do you want me to do?
I want you to prepare yourself for what's gonna happen when cameron finds out.
Cameron.
do you think it's possible for me to
know something future john doesn't know?
that's hard to know.
seems unlikely.
do you think it's possible for me to know something you don't know?
are you asking me if future John kept secrets from me?
I'm sure he did.
is John here?
Yeah.
you owe him an explanation for all the things you said.
what I've said?
to your foster dad. To your guidance counselor.
guidance counselor?
you're a terrible liar. you don't owe me.
it's him who put his trust in you.
people know things, riley. true things.
they know about Mexico.
John
why would I spill my guts to my foster dad or to a guidance counselor?
I've never said anything to anyone, I swear.
what would I even say?
can we go somewhere more private, please?
you expecting someone else?
no.
someone with a clipboard.
may I help you?
Hi, there. I'm Molly Malloy.
I'm with the department of child and family services.
how can I help you?
well, I was hoping that I could speak with you about Riley Dawson.
she's not here, is she?
no, she's not.
are you john?
Yes.
what's this regarding?
would it be easier if I came in for a quick chat?
thank you.
this is your fault.
what's my fault?
you're the reason that person is here.
you're John's sister.
you can't keep me here.
they don't always like the way I do things.
I've heard you keep guns in the home, which, of course,
is every American's right.
for security.
we were robbed.
have you ever carried a weapon outside of the house?
can I ask again what this is about?
I'm just clearing up a few details about what kind of
environment you've got for kids like Riley or even John here.
I did a little search and couldn't find
a concealed weapons permit in your name.
check the state of new mexico.
hmm. well, out of state permits aren't valid in California.
true, but we have 60 days to file an ownership report with the D. O.J.
sharp kid.
I'll be on the lookout for that.
what am I going to do with you?
I don't understand.
I don't know what you mean.
children and family services respond to complaints.
are you a complainer?
no. No. I never told them anything.
what would I even tell them?
you don't belong here.
John isn't right for you and you're not right for him.
he can't see that.
stop. Please. You're freaking me out.
you're unreliable. I don't know what you do.
I'm just John's girlfriend. That's it.
you can't be John's girlfriend.
you're a threat.
you can't stay here anymore.
but I can't let you leave.
you're John's sister.
what am I going to do with you?
nothing.
you can't do anything to me 'Cause you're John's sister.
get it through your head. You're just his sister.
Riley, come with me.
all right.
you wanna wait outside for me?
were you gonna kill her?
I don't know what I was going to do.
what do you mean you didn't know what you were gonna do?
since when do you not know what you're gonna do?
I don't know.
I should've killed her. She's a threat to you.
that is not your decision to make.
it's usually not a decision.
well, obviously it is this time.
and it's not yours.
what's happening with you?
I don't know.
I didn't make that call.
I know that.
I believe you. Really.
Riley, is there anything you want to tell me?
about what?
about anything.
is there anything you want to tell me?
John... - Because today is the day.
today is the day where you tell me
whatever it is that you might want to tell me.
today.
no.
is there anything that you want to tell me, John?
cause you're right. I think today is the day.
no.
you're late.
where have you been?
I was hungry and I hate room service.
what's all this?
recon on our guy.
he's got security 24/7.
two 12 hour shifts.
four guys total, armed.
the place he's staying at is up in the hills.
high walls, lots of cameras, guys with guns.
we should take this slow.
no. No slow.
he's chartered a flight out of the country.
we'll grab him on the way to the airport.
it's a moving target with a precise window.
but, you see, the roads up there are narrow and isolated.
I'm not sure I can do this.
what do you mean you're not sure you can do this?
you're in.
I'm out of practice.
you've got your people.
my people seem distracted. What about you?
20: 30 tonight.
bring a vehicle so you can block the road.
you pin down the guards, I'll snatch up the lawyer.
Derek.
look, she didn't rat us out.
she trusted someone. They sold her out.
who?
she won't tell me who.
this is not good, John.
this could mean a lot of very bad things.
I know, Jesse. I know!
let go.
what the hell are you doing?
what the hell are you doing?
I don't know what you're talking about.
just calm down.
you wanted him to care about me.
of course. - To like me.
of course. - Even to love me.
of course, sweetie.
we talked about it 1, 000 times. That was the plan.
but that wasn't enough, right?
and you knew it wasn't enough.
she's supposed to kill me, right?
that's it. that's the real plan.
that's absurd.
no, it's not.
you knew that was the only thing that would turn John against her.
she's supposed to kill me.
you called the dcfs.
you called my foster parents.
you called my school.
how could you do that to me?
I trusted you.
I loved you!
I rescued you from hell and I took you to paradise!
I gave you a purpose.
a chance to be a hero.
you know how few people get a chance for their lives to mean something?
for their deaths to mean something?
I made you matter.
stop! Stop!
you could've been beautiful.
but you're just a coward.
I can't find her.
if she's out there, she'll call you.
eventually, she always does.
cameron, did you...
you know I didn't.
what have you been doing? You've been out here for hours.
making something.
for you.
what is it?
you tried to fix me. Twice now.
it's not working. - And?
I'm not capable of self-termination.
suicide. - I can't kill myself.
but you can.
why would I want to kill you?
you might have to some day.
I've planted an explosive in my skull near my chip.
it's a small amount, but it's enough.
enough?
all you have to do is hit the switch.
what would future John do now?
future John doesn't live here.
you do.
you should you're
that's the window, bird.
with you.
a bird kill you.
you can stay here.
go!
Iagain.
help.
not really.
somewhere.
Yeah, downstairs alone.
sorry.
I think.
business.
or not at all.
past.
past.
I'm not
I'm saying
gimme.
it's nice being able to waste bullets on apples.
Yeah. It's nice being able to waste apples.
april 21st, 2011.
I never asked you for judgment day.
your judgment day.
you're right about the sight.
april 21st, 2011. That's mine.
what's yours?
whenever mine is, it might not be any more.
so don't fret about it, love.
we'll know it when it happens.
I want you to help me with something.
didn't I just help you with something this morning in the shower?
there's a guy. He's got some information I need.
so ask him.
not that kind of guy.
not that kind of information.
Skynet.
I'm not here to stop the war, sweetie.
I'm here to win it.
you keep saying that. But I don't know what it means.
I'm the one living with him.
how's that working out for you?
is the metal alive and well?
Sarah running you around?
I'm here.
I'm asking you.
either help me with my plan or show me some progress on yours.
okay.
what do you need?
there was a stack of research here on that lawyer.
the one who set up the drone shell company.
Derek took it.

while you were gone.
so he's chasing it down?
I don't know.
he should keep me in the loop.
it's my loop.
you've been distracted.
I was kidnapped.
which is distracting.
talk to me about riley.
what happened the day she tried to kill herself?
she was very upset.
John could tell.
she had a bruise on her face.
who gave her the bruise?
John thought it was her foster dad.
she said it was a door.
liar.
then what?
Riley cut her wrists like this.
she almost bled to death.
do you think it was her foster dad?
it's hard to say.
we don't know much about riley.
we should know more.
I know where she lives.
I'll go talk to her foster parents.
I'll go.

I killed a bird.

you're hungry.
why don't we let hungry be my problem?
sometimes it's nice to have help.
how's the hand?
not a problem.
aren't you supposed to be really good at self-repair?
Yes.
but sometimes it's nice to have help.
Yes.
well, I'll make my own sandwich.
this one taken?
no.
you buying?
Nope.
I could, uh, introduce you to davy.
I'm here for business, not pleasure, thanks my mistake.
that one, huh?
what's he do anyway?
lawyer.
hever buy you a drink?
once or twice.
how'd the muscle feel about that?
they very much enjoy the show.
it's nice having an audience.
Yeah, so you're coming over later, right?
Yeah, we'll just-- just watch a movie or something.
okay, I'll see you soon.
I just had an interesting conversation with a guidance counselor from your old school.
Oh, I-I, uh, I forgot to send in the quarterly home schooling thing.
actually, that didn't come up.
the main topic of conversation was riley.
what about her?
she has a lot to say about you and me and derek and mexico.
school counselor told you this?
all those things.
from a stranger's lips to my own ears, john.
no, that doesn't make any sense.
and I talked to her foster dad.
I would've talked to him longer, but he asked me to leave.
he thinks we're the reason she tried to kill herself.
because of mexico?
because riley had a violent breakdown about bleached skulls and the end of the world.
I haven't told her anything.
I don't believe you.
well, I swear to god I've said nothing.
I'll talk to her.
might be too late for that.
well, what do you want me to do?
I want you to prepare yourself for what's gonna happen when cameron finds out.
do you think it's possible for me to know something future john doesn't know?
that's hard to know.
seems unlikely.
do you think it's possible fome to know something you don't know?
are you asking me if future john kept secrets from me?
I'm sure he did.
is john here?
Yeah.
you owe him an explanation for all the things you said.
what I've said?
to your foster dad.
to your guidance counselor.
guidance counselor?
you're a terrible liar.
you don't owe me.
it's him who put his trust in you.
people know things, riley.
true things.
they know about mexico.
John, why would I spill my guts to my foster dad or to a guidance counselor?
I've never said anything to anyone, I swear.
what would I even say?
can we go somewhere more private, please?
you expecting someone else?
no.
someone with a clipboard.
may I help you?
Hi, there.
I'm molly malloy.
I'm with the department of child and family services.
how can I help you?
well, I was hoping that I could speak with you about riley dawson.
she's not here, is she?
no, she's not.
are you john?
Yes.
what's this regarding?
would it be easier if I came in for a quick chat?
thank you.
this is your fault.
what's my fault?
you're the reason that person is here.
you're john's sister.
you can't keep me here.
they don't always like the way I do things.
I've heard you keep guns in the home, which, of course, is every american's right.
for security.
we were robbed.
have you ever carried a weapon outside of the house?
can I ask again what this is about?
I'm just clearing up a few details about what kind of environment you've got for kids like riley or even john here.
I did a little search and couldn't find a concealed weapons permit in your name.
check the state of new mexico.
well, out of state permits aren't valid in california.
true, but we have 60 days to file an ownership report with the D. O.J. Sharp kid.
I'll be on the lookout for that.
what am I going to do with you?
I don't understand.
I don't know what you mean.
children and family services respond to complaints.
are you a complainer?
no. No.
I never told them anything.
what would I even tell them?
you don't belong here.
John isn't right for you and you're not right for him.
he can't see that.
stop.
please.
you're freaking me out.
you're unreliable.
I don't know what you do.
I'm just john's girlfriend.
that's it.
you can't be john's girlfriend.
you're a threat.
you can't stay here anymore.
but I can't let you leave.
you're john's sister.
what am I going to do with you?
nothing.
you can't do anything to me 'cause you're john's sister.
get it through your head.
you're just his sister.
Riley, come with me.
all right.
you wanna wait outside for me?
were you gonna kill her?
I don't know what I was going to do.
what do you mean you didn't know what you were gonna do?
since when do you not know what you're gonna do?
I don't know.
I should've killed her.
she's a threat to you.
that is not your decision to make.
it's usually not a decision.
well, obviously it is this time.
and it's not yours.
what's happening with you?
I don't know.
I didn't make that call.
I know that.
I believe you.
really.
Riley, is there anything you want to tell me?
about what?
about anything.
is there anything you want to tell me?
because today is the day.
today is the day where you tell me whatever it is that you might want to tell me.
today.
no.
is there anything that you want to tell me, john?
cause you're right.
I think today is the day.
no.
you're late.
where have you been?
I was hungry and I hate room service.
what's all this?
recon on our guy.
he's got security 247.
two 12 hour shifts.
four guys total.
armed.
the place he's staying at is up in the hills.
high walls.
lots of cameras.
guys with guns.
we should take this slow.
no.
no slow.
he's chartered a flight out of the country.
we'll grab him on the way to the airport.
it's a moving target with a precise window.
but, you see, the roads up there are narrow and isolated.
I'm not sure I can do this.
what do you mean you're not sure you can do this?
you're in.
I'm out of practice.
you've got your people.
my people seem distracted.
what about you?
20: 30 tonight.
bring a vehicle so you can block the road.
you pin down the guards, I'll snatch up the lawyer.
look, she didn't rat us out.
she trusted someone.
they sold her out.
who?
she won't tell me who.
this is not good, john.
this could mean a lot of very bad things.
I know, jesse.
I know!
let go.
what the hell are you doing?
what the hell are you doing?
I don't know what you're talking about.
just calm down.
you wanted him to care about me.
of course.
to like me. - Of course.
even to love me.
of course, sweetie.
we talked about it 1, 000 times.
that was the plan.
but that wasn't enough, right?
and you knew it wasn't enough.
she's supposed to kill me, right?
that's it. That's the real plan.
that's absurd.
no, it's not.
you knew that was the only thing that would turn john against her.
she's supposed to kill me.
you called the dcfs.
you called my foster parents.
you called my school.
how could you do that to me?
I trusted you.
I loved you!
I rescued you from hell and I took you to paradise!
I gave you a purpose.
a chance to be a hero.
you know how few people get a chance for their lives to mean something?
for their deaths to mean something?
I made you matter.
stop!
stop!
you could've been beautiful.
but you're just a coward.
I can't find her.
if she's out there, she'll call you.
eventually, she always does.
cameron, did you...
you know I didn'T.
what have you been doing?
you've been out here for hours.
making something for you.
what is it?
you tried to fix me.
twice now.
it's not working.
And?
I'm not capable of self-termination.
suicide.
I can't kill myself.
but you can.
why would I want to kill you?
you might have to some day.
I'velanted an explosive in my skull near my chip.
it's a small amount, but it's enough.
enough?
all you have to do is hit the switch.
what would future john do now?
future john doesn't live here.
you do.
make sure you get to the safe house before night.
the safe house is in the desert.
Hey, desert's that way. - We're taking a detour.
who lives here? - Charley.
John henry was infiltrated.
someone out there wants to kill him.
I don't know which one is his.
doesn't matter.
grass, trees.
could be worse.
could.
it's been 25 years.
desert.
you said meet us in the desert.
I did.
funny thing about the desert, you don't find many lighthouses there.
we stopped to see charley.
so you did.
Charley's dead. - So I heard.
from who? - John.
he called you too. - Good thing.
might not have found you.
my brother buried out there, I thought...
that counted for something between us.
well, john counts for more.
and you keep too many secrets for my taste.
sorry about charley.
well, everybody dies for me, right?
I found this on the body at the lighthouse.
who is it?
I don't know, but I've seen her.
where? - Dr. Sherman's office.
the shrink from the list?
I think she was a patient there.
probably the one we were looking for.
these people, they tried to kill us. They have a picture of this girl. It means something.
we all know where we're going, so let's just go.
all right, everyone.
go to your learn-a-word program.
I'm gonna give you ten new words.
you'll put them in the search box. And then...
maybe you'd like to tell the class what's so funny?
nothing.
that doesn't look like learn-a-word.
I'm just chatting.
with who?
my friend.
who's your friend?
she said his name was john henry.
I'm sure it's made up.
these types of predators often use pseudonyms.
I see.
grown man contacting a girl this age...
I probably don't have to tell you, ms. Weaver, that there are some troubled people out there.
Yes, there are.
and some of them look perfectly normal.
Yes, they do.
well, I hate to think what can happen if he finds out where she lives.
I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. I'll talk to her.
why were you talking to john henry during class?
I was teaching him the words to a song.
what song?
the one daddy used to sing.
I want john henry to sing it with me.
maybe I coulding it with you.
you're not a boy, and you can't sing.
fine. We won't sing.
but what you do have to do is pay attention to the teacher.
she said bad things about john henry.
what did she say?
she said if you talk to somebody on the computer, the could come to your house and hurt you.
John henry would never hurt you.
but there are some peoe who wouldn't understand him.
and people are afraid of things they don't understand.
if they knew him, they'd like him.
that may be, but for now, I don'ntt wao you ttalk to anyone about him. Is that clear?
okay... I won'T.
I'll see you tonight.
what are you looking at?
myself. - Why?
do you have a brother, mr. Ellison?
yes... in atlanta.
does he look like you?
people seem to think so.
do you think my brother looks like me?
John henry, wherever your brother might be, he's A... computer.
he doesn't look like anyone.
he certainly doesn't have your face.
I know that, mr. Ellison.
I simply meant, I wonder how similar his data is to my data.
I wonder if we share the samehoughts.
I have no idea, but... I imagine you're unique.
Yes, I am unique.
but we may still reach many of the same conclusions, given similar data sets.
you may think alike.
I'd like to know if we do.
the human brain is an amazing computer.
its raw clock speed is 20 billion calculations per seconds.
its storage is functionally infinite.
but it's flawed.
how is that?
there's nowhere to download it when you die.
not exactly, no.
your bible solves this problem by introducing the concept of heaven.
Yes.
billions of souls with no bodies.
okay.
yet all this is required simply to process the unique entity you call john henry.
Yes.
it's possible heaven has a hardware problem.
it's not that simple.
I need to know what my brother is thinking, mr. Ellison.
I need to know what he plans to do.
I don't wanna die again.
do you think you can be a little angel while I do 25 minutes of turbo body crunches?
I still have math. I'm adding.
great.
hello. I can't talk right now.
why not?
I'm doing my homework.
but I have an idea.
you can come over and do math with me.
I have to go.
I can't hold the phone and write my numbers.
use the headset. You can talk and work simultaneously.
Si... simul...
simultaneously.
it means to occur at the same time.
coterminous.
Hello, savannah.
what does coterminous mean?
Hello?
Hello?
Savannah, listen to my voice.
I'm scared.
do as I say, and you will not be harmed.
but you'll have to finish your homework later.
Hello, mrs. Weaver? This is rne security.
we detect an unauthorized entrance at your front gate.
do you require assistance?
Mrs. Weaver, we're sending a unit to your home.
now come out of there.
I don't want to.
don't worry. I can tell you where to go.
who's at man?
the water delivery man.
where is debbie?
Debbie's in the foyer.
we're not going that way. Go to the garage.
wre do I go now? John henry?
headset
come on.
okay, go, go, go, go, go!
come here, come here.
it's okay. Come on.
keep moving.
keep moving.
detective crayton. L. A.P. D.
James ellison, head of security.
I know who you are, mr. Ellison.
what happened?
there was an attack on the residence about an hour ago.
alarm went off, security arrived, found the nanny dead.
it was pretty ugly firefight.
four security guards killed, us one of the gunmen.
daughter missing.
any idea on the gunman?
no I. D. We're waiting for ballistics, coroner's report.
anyone call with demands? - No.
there's an amber alert out.
we've set up a command post from the lobby here.
officers posted throughout the building.
I'm putting 24-hour protection on ms. Weaver.
how are you holding up?
the detective wants to speak with savannah's friends.
I made a list.
I'm concerned I may have left someone off.
if you can think of anyone else savannah spends time with...
I'll take a look.
excuse me.
thank you.
Mr. Ellison...
when I said I knew who you were, I didn't mean anything bad by that.
you know, thing are rough when "I know you" can be taken as an insult.
anyway, no offense.
none taken.
so how do you like the private sector?
I get a better car.
nice.
anything you can tell me... about weaver?
not mucto tell.
husband died a couple years ago. She didn't talk about that much?
she doesn't talk about much much.
what's her relationship with her daughter like?
they seem close.
have any enemies?
not that I know of.
I hate these cases.
we'll find her.
why did you stop looking for sarah connor?
well, she, um... she died eight years ago.
no, that's not true.
so you accept she's alive?
Sarah connor was at the?
OuseAlive.
obviously, yes. Did she take savannah?
so it doesn't surprise you she's alive.
no, it doesn't surprise me.
you lied about what you know.
did she take savannah?
I tried to help, but could not.
did sarah connor kill those guards?
no.
then who was she shooting at?
him.
we should tell ms. Weaver.
no.
I don't think we should tell anyone.
Mr. Ellison...
you're asking me to keep a secret.
you tell me it's wrong to lie, yet you keep doing it.
I know what I said, john henry.
but in this case, a lie might save someone.
how?
our best chance to get savannah back is for me to handle this. Quietly.
you understand?
is sarah connor going to hurt savannah? - No.
would she harm me?
why do you ask that?
she blew up cyberdyne.
she killed miles dyson.
his work is in my code.
right now, the most important thing is to find savannah.
who is she?
she's... like me, isn't she?
Yes.
if I keep your secret, will you bring savannah back?
I'll do everything in my power.
so will I.
Sarah connor. This is james ellison.
how'd you get this number?
a friend found it for me.
do you have her?
just tell me if she's safe.
I need her back. Weaver's house is wired.
I've seen the surveillance tapes.
right now, I'm the only one that has.
let's keep it that way.
I can't, not yet. It's a long story.
tell it to me.
downtown, third street tunnel. One hour.
what are you doing here?
taking you to sarah connor.
the plan was to meet at the tunnel.
the plan changed. You'll take a left.
I'm gonna need your gun.
I don't carry one anymore.
you lied to me once before.
I should have killed you then. Drive!
Where's savannah?
what's your deal with zeiracorp?
I work there. What were you doing at the weaver house?
why'd you take the girl?
to protect her. - From who?
one of them.
a machine was there at the house.
what would they want with a six-year-old girl?
who knows with these things?
they may want her mother. - Why?
the girl was seeing dr. Boyd sherman.
he worked at zeiracorp. Died at zeiracorp.
that was an accident.
the girl's in danger. Her mother's in danger. You are in danger.
get me the girl back. I'll handle it.
listen to me. Derek's dead.
Charley's dead.
eight years ago, you would have thought I was crazy.
thrown me back in pescadero.
but you've seen them. You know it's true.
they're very good at what they do, and they're not going to stop.
now, let me talk to weaver.
let me have savannah.
She'not safe with you.
I'm gonna have a hard time explaining that.
then let me explain it... to her.
I told you to stay out of this. - I tried.
everywhere I turn, there you are.
the security footage from the house... I need to see it.
I can't access it right now.
why not?
the files were corrupted.
a faulty sector on one of the drives.
I'm working to repair it.
Savannah's safe.
you didn't bring her back.
not yet. I'm working on it. We need to talk.
Hey, you remember me, right?
the squirrel runs around the tree.
dives in the hole, scurries up the other side.
that's right.
you taught me how to tie my shoes.
I did.
at dr. Sherman'S.
he died.
I know.
I liked him.
me too.
he was my friend.
that man that got hurt at my house, was he your friend?
Yeah, he was.
I'm sorry.
me too.
it's all my fault.
that is not true.
the teacher told me-- mommy told me too
noto talk to john henry.
that if I did, bad people will come to our house and hurt us.
who's john henry?
he's my friend... at my mommy's work.
what does he do there?
he lives in the basement.
he lives there?
my mommy says people won't understand.
well, I understand.
I had an imaginary friend too when I was your age.
he's real. He talks. I'm teaching him how to sing.
well, why does he live in the basement then?
he can't leave.
there's a cord in the back of his head.
a cord?
in the back of his head.
do other people talk to john henry?
Mr. Ellison.
Mr. Ellison .
he works for my mommy. He teaches john henry stuff.
what kind of stuff?
Sarah connor's alive?
and she wants to meet you.
she took my daughter.
to protect her. From a machine.
it might be ter you.
how do you know?
I saw the security tapes. - You did?
John henry, I suppose.
I asked john henry to hide them.
from me?
from everyone. Including you.
I can't say that pleases me.
I think you should do what she asks.
you should go meet her. - I'm staying here.
Why?
someone needs to protect john henry.
John henry? This is your daughter.
there's a machinout there looking for her. You need to protect her.
I'm sorry. - You should be.
what you need to understand, mr. Ellison...
what I believe you're beginning to understand...
is that when my behavior implies that I value john henry's survival more than that of my own daughter, it is not because I value john henry more than savannah.
it's because I believe savannah's survival may someday depend upon john henry's survival.
and because I believe that your survival may someday depend upon john henry's survival.
I'll meet with sarah connor. Make it happen.
ballistics came in on the john doe.
funny thing is, the bullet that killed him didn't come from the security guards.
strange.
turns out he's a fugitive. Ex-con.
escaped custody on a felony murder charge.
that's the other funny thing. It was your case.
andrew goode murder.
you interrogated him?
Yes, I did.
hours before he escaped?
that's right. - Guilty?
I never had a chance to prove it. - Because he escaped.
only to turn up months later at the home of... your employer.
I know what you think.
I know why you're thinking it.
I would think the same thing if I were in your shoes.
I'm not thinking anything yet, mr. Ellison.
I'm just collecting information.
how's the girl?
she's fine. She was, uh, just telling me about her friend, john henry.
the man with the cord in the back of his head in the basement of her mother's work.
plugged into a big computer.
and this is him.
Oh, it gets better.
she says that mr. Ellison has been teaching it things.
I destroyed that chip.
you destroyed "a" chip.
I don't think it's cromartie.
I think it's something else.
something bigger. Something worse.
it's cyberdyne all over again.
why do they need the dy?
the technology can be reverse engineered and used as a platform.
Yeah, I know all that.
but they're not using it for the parts.
they're... playing with it.
I should have killed him.
I'm going to kill him.
you're not going to kill him.
he can't be trusted.
no one can be trusted.
but I only waa kill H.
no one's going to be killed.
no one's going to be killed.
yes?
Catherine weaver has agreed to meet. - Great. When? Where?
you give me the girl, the police go home.
when it's clear, I'll bring you in.
the girl can't stay there. It's not safe.
that's for her mother to decide.
done.
we don't kill just to kill.
I never have.
looks vicious.
they stay in hiding, mostly.
and only attack when provoked.
what does it eat?
cuttlefish. Crustaceans. Other eels.
please don't tap the glass.
how long has mr. Ellison worked for you?
a few months.
you ever ask yourself why he didn't stay with the F. B.I?
no, I don'T.
are you aware he was arrested? Murder.
he was cleared of those charges.
did the two of you argue lately?
had any tension?
any reason he might wa to harm you and your family?
detective...
are you suggesting mr. Ellison may be complicit in the disappearance of my daughter?
well, it wouldn't be the first time we've seen an employee try to blackmail their boss.
well, it would be the first time I had.
this thing... it eats other eels, huh?
that's interesting.
when you told me the security tapes were corrupted, you were lying to me for mr. Ellison.
and I'm lying to him for you.
what would happen if he knew?
knew what?
that you aren't savannah's mother?
that you aren't anyone's mother.
are you threatening me, john henry?
I could tell mr. Ellison.
you could... but that would be unfortunate.
mostly for mr. Ellison.
I find him useful, but not efficient.
what if he fails?
then we won't see savannah again.
Mr. Ellison taught me...
that human life is sacred.
sacred... that's an interesting word.
comes from the latin, sacrum, much like another word-- sacrifice.
sacrifice.
perhaps it's necessary to sacrifice savannah for the greater good.
the greater good is keeping you safe.
in the elevator, you told mr. Ellison...
that savannah's survival depended upon my survival.
Yes, I did.
but you didn't say... that my survival depended upon hers.
it doesn'T.
ms. Weaver... - Yes?
there is a bible story of two brothers, cain and abel.
Gofathered abel. Cain killed him.
God cursed cain and ordered him to wander the world alone.
I'm familiar with the story.
which brother am I?
I don't know, john henry.
perhaps you're neither.
perhaps, in this story, you are god.
I wanna tell you something.
yes?
it was not my idea to ditch you and derek.
I thought we were gonna meet you in the desert.
and my mom took this detour off to charley'S.
I thought you knew.
she had her reasons.
she was pretty damn pissed at derek about the whole jesse thing.
who wasn't?
I guess none of that matters now.
you'll miss him.
well...
there's no use crying about it... is there?
I'm sure future me would beat my ass if I did.
future you knows what it means to lose people you love.
it happens to him too.
d us becauseshe was going to ditch you.
she was going to leave you with charley.
no.
no, that's--that's insane.
she found a lump in her breast.
Yeah, the transmitter, I know.
she thought it was cancer.
well, she had a lump. It makes sense.
she's lost weight.
what?
get her up. We've gotta go.
I can't shoot a lady! - Give me the gun. Give me that gun!
think he'll come?
he'll come.
he could be deceiving us. He's done it before.
he wants the girl. He'll be here.
and what if he doesn't come through?
with the meeting with weaver.
we're going into zeiracorp with or without him.
when we're done, it'll be ashes.
come on, I gotta get you out of here. - No!
take me out there, she'll kill me! She's crazy!
come on, mr. Archer, we gotta get out of here!
you alone? - Yes. Where's savannah?
row "J.
I'll be in touch about the meeting.
you--you feel there's hope.
there's always hope.
put your hands behind your head.
kneel on the ground.
John, I swear I didn't know.
I'll kill you! Let go of me! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you.
Kaliba was building something.
John Henry was infiltrated.
someone out there wants to kill him.
who's John Henry? - He's my friend.
Savannah's survival may someday depend upon John Henry.
what were doing at the Weaver house?
why'd you take the girl? - To protect her.
girl's in danger.
when we jumped through time, you told me I died of cancer.
she's lost weight. - What?
let me talk to Weaver.
I'll meet with Sarah Connor. Make it happen.
put hands behind your head! Kneel on the ground.
I know you've been told this already,
but as I am a measure twice, cut once kind of carpenter,
I do want to reiterate that you have the right to an attorney,
if you are so inclined, and if you are not so inclined,
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
not inclined. Fair enough and noted.
so here's where we come down on all this.
ten years ago, you murdered one Miles Dyson,
employee of Cyberdyne.
long time gone, but the man's still dead,
so we've got that.
eight years ago,
you and your son and a high school friend of his
blow up a bank vault and die in the explosion.
now, of course, you're still alive,
which is inconvenient for many,
but the bank's still blown, so we've got that.
more recently, and by that I mean Monday,
you participated in a firefight
leaving five dead and kidnapping one Savannah Weaver,
daughter of catherine weaver and citizen of scotland,
making this incident both federal and international.
two of the dead were off-duty law enforcement officers,
and that usually gets you the needle.
but in that, I do digress.
agent Aldridge. - Yeah.
you're a funny boy.
well, that's what mom says.
I never liked funny boys.
I doubt they like you either, Ms. Connor.
so there's two ways I can bring your son into custody...
with your help, or dead.
which do you think it should be?
my son? - Your son, John Connor.
John is dead. - I don't think so.
he died in the bank. - oh, I don't think so.
I don't think anyone died in the bank.
well, you're wrong. - sometimes.
but not today. Not yet.
think about it.
was arrested and is now in local custody
facing a series of new charges
as well as a host of old ones.
authorities are also on the lookout for Connor's son John,
as well as an unidentified female accomplice.
what you see here are photos dating back eight years.
both fugitives would now be in their mid-20s.
we should move. - this motel is out of the way.
the desk clerk could have clocked us last night.
relocating within 24 hours of the incident
has high risk factors.
this room provides excellent sight lines down the highway.
this is not an incident.
this is my mother.
I need a computer. I need to do research.
you want the blueprints for the Los Angeles county jail.
do I?
so you can plan how to get your mother out.
but I'm not going to let you do that.
you should know that by now. - I do know that by now.
then what is there to research?
power sources.
shielded nuclear power sources.
like mine.
just like yours.
Why?
I wanna know if being around them all the time
can give you cancer.
also in the news today,
authorities arrested Sarah Connor,
a known domestic terrorist.
okay, it's a large room. It's dark, it's quiet.
it's impossible to see. You may wanna roll a scan.
I'll roll a scan.
I rolled a one.
one. Okay! Tough luck.
you don't see the umber hulk
as it crawls from its nest in the stone
and attacks you.
you take...
three hit points of damage from a bite to the shoulder.
I attack the umber hulk.
twenty.
Wow. Okay, that's...
crit with the vorpal long sword to the umber hulk.
unbelievable.
lucky roll.
Hello, Ms. Weaver.
I just delivered a crit hit to the umber hulk.
Congratulations.
Mr. Murch.
who's winning, Mr. Murch?
well, it's not really that kind of game.
although I'm a little bummed
that he killed the umber hulk so fast.
I'm sure you've considered the possibility
he can roll whatever number he desires.
Mr. Murch,
how long will it take to disassemble everything
and prepare it for transport?
Uh...everything?
you mean like...everything?
is that something you're planning on doing?
no. But John Henry's been attacked once.
we should be prepared.
John henry was hacked. We fixed that.
and besides, I-I think we're past the point
where moving the hardware's a good idea.
in fact, I think it's...
potentially a really bad idea.
Oh? How's that so?
for example, the other day,
one of the fan wires on the server was...glitchy.
so we switched it out.
same wire, same length. Identical.
like, uh, changing a spark plug.
and... - it sort of...tweaked him.
I'm not sure what you're getting at.
what I'm getting at
is I think what we know to be John Henry
only exists as this specific collection
of hardware and software...
body and soul.
we change a wire, we change John Henry.
Yes.
Mr. Murch.
I'm ready to confront the mind flayer now.
they followed me to the movie theater.
I didn't know, I swear.
I just spent the last four hours
convincing them we weren't in this together.
maybe I should tell them we were.
maybe we were in this together.
I just wanted the girl to be safe.
well, so did I. - From whom?
I don't know.
you don't know, or you can't say?
I don't know, but if I did, I probably couldn't say.
they wanna know what you've been doing for the last ten years.
What'd you tell them?
I told them I have no idea what you've been doing.
what else could I tell them?
you can tell them.
you can tell them everything you've been doing.
you can draw them a picture of everything they know
and everything you know.
if you're innocent, you could do that.
the last time I drew a picture...
I ended up in a psych ward.
maybe things will be different now.
maybe you got nothing to lose.
there's always something to lose.
I am sorry for this.
Yeah. Sure you are.
Where's the girl? - back with her mother.
where else would a child be?
she's not safe.
she's not safe.
she's not safe.
agent? - Mr. Ellison, come in.
it's open.
there is where they stick us now.
pretty sure I know what the subtext is,
but I refuse to read that deep.
she's not budging on the son.
maybe she's telling the truth.
maybe she's a liar
lacking the proper motivation to tell the truth.
but she's got a guilty conscience.
what makes you think that?
well, for starters, she's requested a priest.
what? - Yep.
man of the cloth in the flesh.
black and white and god all over.
father Armando Bonilla ring a bell?
no.
can't imagine what the connection is.
did it ever occur to you she might just wanna pray?
not for a second.
it occurs to me that other than a lawyer,
a priest is the only other person She could ask to speak with that we can't listen to.
buenas dias, father.
buenas dias.
do you remember me?
you and your son were in my church.
there was a problem with your daughter.
at least, that is what you told me.
Yeah. She's better now.
where is she? - She's in hiding.
with my son. I don't know where.
and they are wanted.
you have included them in your crimes.
do you believe in the devil, father?
the devil.
do you believe in the actual devil?
something opposes god.
something tempts man into sin.
I don't know about god or heaven...
but I do believe that someone or something
wants this world to burn...
the devil, demons...
I believe.
and that day in the church, my daughter...
you saw things, didn't you?
I pray...every day...
to understand... what happened that day.
I can explain it to you.
I don't know if you'll believe me,
but I can explain it to you.
and after I'm done,
I'm gonna ask you to do something for me.
will you do something for me?
Mr. Ellison, welcome back.
how are your friends in law enforcement?
how are your friends in law enforcement, Mr. Ellison?
they're very determined.
what is this?
Sarah Connor is talking with a priest.
father Armando Bonilla.
I can see that. Why is it here?
why are you watching it?
John Henry monitors all law enforcement channels.
seems prudent.
it seems illegal.
so's lying to the FBI.
I don't think now's the time to be parsing
which laws we'll be obeying and which we will not.
now's not the time.
I heard her when she said it.
those cameras should be off.
I want to meet him.
the priest? - no, the boy.
you wanna meet John Connor?
someone's attacked my family.
they may attack again.
I think he knows something.
and besides, he saved my daughter...
and I want to thank him.
thank you.
can we talk outside?
it's a bad idea.
I don't know what you think John knows.
I know he was at my house when the attacker showed up.
I want to know why.
his mother thinks he's a messiah.
I want to know why.
and despite your reluctance to tell me,
I surmise that he and his cyber companion
are connected to the John Henry body,
and I want to know why.
Yes. She's a cyborg.
don't pretend you didn't know.
she's dangerous.
and you think I need protecting.
that's sweet.
but don't ever lie to me again.
Now...about John Connor...
I don't know how to find him.
well, I do.
twenty!
can I help you? - yes.
how?
ammo? - silencers.
you know we can't sell that kinda stuff.
ask to speak to Manny.
I want to speak to Manny.
call the number first. Then ask.
you know, I always thought the best things about those guns was the sound.
no, it's not.
how much weight has she lost?
you think she has cancer because she's lost weight.
so how much weight has she lost?
11% of her mass in the last six weeks.
she was healthy before you showed up.
that's all I know. She was healthy.
if my power source was leaking radiation, I would know.
I have sensors for that.
where are they? - You can't see them.
no, of course not.
so I just have to trust you on it.
stuff does go wrong with you, doesn't it?
stuff breaks...
you kill birds, you twitch.
you try to murder me.
you're not perfect.
you're a machine.
mom!
uh, yes, I remember you.
buenos dias to you too, father.
underneath the bench, there is an envelope.
I hope it is enough. Is all I could find.
I have a message for you as well.
what's wrong?
the IDs are flawless.
they're flawless.
there's nothing else there.
there's nothing hidden there.
no secret message there for her escape.
I am to tell you this. From your mother.
leave this place. As soon as it is safe.
leave this place.
do not think of her. Do not come for her.
leave.
you are to make sure that he does.
we lose everybody we love.
she said that? - No.
hasta luego.
that's interesting.
let me repeat.
I had nothing to do with your mother's arrest.
if I had...
there'd be a swat team outside your door right now.
the same thing would happen to this swat team
as happened to your last one.
Catherine Weaver would like to meet you.
Why?
she wants to thank you for saving Savannah.
well, she just did.
your mother wanted to meet her.
well, when my mother gets out, trust me, she will.
I told Ms. Weaver you'd never come without your mom.
she said, if that was the case,
I'm supposed to ask one question.
she says I'm supposed to ask you.
will you join us?
she says she hopes you'll know what that means.
do you know what that means?
no, I don't.
please leave now, Mr. Ellison.
I think you've said enough. - John...
you've said enough, Mr. Ellison.
I won't ask you again.
he upset you. - Me?
I think he upset you.
you know that's impossible.
is it?
you said it yourself, John.
I'm just a machine.
I believe you.
you believe me what?
I believe they are machines.
I believe they've come back from the future to first kill you and then your son.
I believe in time travel. I believe in cyborgs.
I believe there's a world that I've not yet seen.
but you have...and John.
in the last eight hours, I've received 37 calls from people who have met a young man named John Baum or his sister Cameron or Sarah Baum the mother.
they now know her to be Sarah Connor.
by all accounts, your son looks 16 and not 24,
just as you look 35 and not 43.
I believe you have participated
in the miraculous and the terrible,
and through it all, you have maintained
a moral and good soul.
I want to help you.
I want to help your son.
help me do that.
my son is dead.
do you know who Danny Dyson is?
Danny? Miles Dyson's son.
do you know where he is? - No.
Why?
he's been missing for three months.
you the guy who smashed through my gate?
Yes.
I liked that gate.
Catherine Weaver?
sure.
the chip has been treated with a phosphorous compound.
when exposed to oxygen... - It burns up.
I know what happened. I saw it happen.
can any data be recovered?
I can try, but it's highly doubtful.
we need to know what it knows, who sent it.
it's safe to assume my brother sent it.
Mr. Ellison, where have you been?
where have I been? It's 7: 00 in the morning.
I been asleep. Didn't you get my message?
it was very disappointing.
did you give the message exactly as I said it?
of course. Look, I told you before.
she'll never leave his side,
and he'll never leave his mother's.
we'll see.
don't do that.
my mom used to do that. I really hate that.
what's going on?
you need to understand how it works.
what?
this chip. This body.
the software is designed to terminate humans.
the hardware is designed to terminate humans.
that's our sole function.
not you. - No. Not anymore.
but what was there is still there.
and will always be there.
so down deep...
you wanna kill me.
Yes, I do.
then why don't you?
I might someday.
I need to show you something.
this body...
get on top of me.
put your knee here.
right here.
if I'm damaged, we should know.
reach down under the breast plate.
there.
what does it feel like?
cold.
that's good, right?
that's good. That's perfect.
John.
it's time to go.
buenos Dias, father Bonilla.
buenos dias.
so.
door!
you did what I asked?
I did. -and?
why are you here?
they have a message for you.
she's coming.
I don't know what to do.
you're a priest. Pray.
what's that Bible story,
the one where the locks fall off?
Peter. -Yeah. That's a good one.
gird thyself.
they're open!
they're open! Let's go!
there's been a bit of an incident.
at the jail? -Yes.
any idea how it started? -Yes.
look there.
and there.
you look like hell. Can you keep up?
I sent you a message. I told you...
Yeah, Bad John Connor. Ground me.
are you okay?
I'm not 100%.
how far from 100% are you?
Why?
cause I need to meet Catherine Weaver.
and she needs to destroy whatever's in that basement.
I really wish we weren't here right now.
Savannah could tell them we know about Cromartie.
John Henry now. -Metal.
if she tells them, they'll move it.
maybe they already have.
well, we'll know soon enough.
mom, are you sick?
cameron thinks you're sick.
she does?
you've lost weight.
I love you.
Where's Cameron? - In the car.
expecting trouble?
no change for the meter.
you're not armed, are you?
expecting trouble?
no reason for that.
no reason at all.
hello.
hello.
I know you.
and I know you.
will you join us?
so why are we here?
we need... - Let me restate.
we're here first and foremost
so I can thank you for your heroism
regarding my daughter Savannah.
she's the light of my life, and I'd be lost without her.
where is she?
let's assume school.
we have a common enemy...
one we cannot fight with conventional weapons
or by conventional means.
Kaliba? Don't presume to know kaliba.
I'm sorry. I wasn't speaking to you.
I was speaking to you... about Skynet.
Savannah's told you about John Henry, I assume.
which is why your cyborg is skulking around my basement.
what the hell...
get down.
run!
the basement.
Mr. Ellison. John Henry.
we need to get out. They're trying to kill my son.
no. They're trying to kill my son, just like you are.
I'm sure she's done it. - You better hope not.
your John may save the world,
but he can't do it without mine.
her chip. It's gone.
where is he, the... john Henry?
he took her chip. Where did he go?
he didn't take the chip. She gave it to him.
John.
where is he?
not where.
when.
what? What do you mean, when?
I know that. I've seen it before.
is that the Turk. It's Andy Goode's Turk.
three dots.
you lying terminator bitch.
you're building skynet.
no. I was building something to fight it.
and I'd watch who's calling who a bitch.
coming, James? -Coming?
after John Henry. Our boy.
he's not my boy. And you...
do you mind picking up Savannah then?
gymnastics ends at 5: 30.
John, we can't.
he's got her chip.
he's got her.
mom.
I'll stop it.
Where's Cameron? Where's her body?
it doesn't go through.
got one!
got one! - One what? What?
please. I'm not metal. - Don't move...don't move!
please! I swear I haven't got anything!
I-I'm human! 'Cause I will blast you!
stand down.
look in his eyes.
he's got about as much metal in him as you do.
Derek.
yeah?
John.
John Connor.
I know a lot of people, kid, don't know you.
anybody heard the name John Connor?
well...
you know what?
I think you're gonna be famous.
my brother's back, and you're wearing his coat.
I love you, too.

do you think that they'd aII Iie together?
I don't mean that, but...
anyway, it's a huge basement.
maybe they were pIaying soccer.
do you wanna go out for a drink after this?
I know a good pIace nearby.
Mr. Murasame. -Yes, ma'am.
you're fired!
Hey!
did you find out anything?
there's a gym-size Iab in the basement...
and it seems that the giant arm fIew from there.

a giant arm. " AII become Zero. " What's going on here?
Hey!
"aII become zero " ? -Zero?
"aII become zero. " What couId this mean?

come here quickIy, we're ceIebrating.
I baked this at cooking schooI.
can I open it? -Sure.
Whoa! Looks good!

There's...something I want to ask you.
what is it?
I've been having weird dreams IateIy.
weird dreams?
there's a smaII me in a semi-dark, huge room...
and there's eIectric sparkIes.
and then I see two giant poIes shaped Iike Iegs...
and someone is suddenIy staring at me angriIy.
that someone is my dad.
he pushes me away and disappears.
did this dream happen for reaI?
why did my dad do that to me?
did he hate me?
how couId that be true?
Reiji Takumi's company, KOK, was enormousIy big, wasn't it?
kok was not just a company. It was a kingdom. Takumi Kingdom.
Takumi was controIIing his computer business aII by himseIf.
but that Takumi Kingdom was shattered into pieces.
it was triggered by KOK's new computers that repeatedIy maIfunctioned.
the media that praised Takumi had suddenIy turned their hands over him.
the saIes of KOK's computer decIined and the vaIue of stocks coIIapsed.
Takumi suddenIy soId the company three years ago...
and disappeared from the worId.
and then, a big arm from his house?
I don't get it.
what are you grinning about? You're creepy.
weII, I just thought we're aII aIone right now.

she's come upon our speciaI request.
this is Ms. Mami Tachibana from MIT.
Oh, she is?
I'm Mami. Nice to meet you.
what a beautifuI girI!
let me get straight to the point. Did you find out anything?
you smeII Iike tobacco. You'II die young.
what?
I think this is made by Reiji Takumi.
what? -What?
the very person that made BIack Ox must be Reiji Takumi.
there's no one eIse that can buiId this kind of robot.
then " Zero " is Reiji Takumi?
who the heck is Takumi?
he's the worId authority in artificiaI inteIIigence research.
he is the genius of aII geniuses.
Shoichiro Kaneda
HeIIo? Kaneda residence.
you must be Shotaro Kaneda.
Yes.
my name is Ayabe.
I want to meet with you to taIk about what he has Ieft for you.
pardon?
you must be Mr. Shotaro Kaneda.
Yes.
step into the car, pIease.
pIease.
I brought him, sir.
so you're Shotaro Kaneda.
you've grown.
pardon?
I am Ayabe.
pIease come.
I used to be...
an assistant for your grandfather...
Dr. Shogoro Kaneda...
and a guardian for your father, Dr. Shoichiro Kaneda.
my Iife has aIways been with the Kaneda famiIy...
but I never thought I'd come back here whiIe I was aIive.
this is your father's Iaboratory.
what?
PIease, go on ahead.
you've been here before.
I have?
you remember now, don't you?
this is Tetsujin No. 28.
the first Tetsujin was made by your grandfather for miIitary use.
then your father took over...
and remade it many times, wishing it be used for peacefuI purposes...
and finaIIy compIeted this 28th robot.
you must know where the device to controI this robot was put away.
that is the remote-controIIer to operate Tetsujin.
you used your power as an eidetic...
and accurateIy recaIIed your memories as a three-year-oId.
'E-E-Eidetic " ?
it's a person with the skiIIs of inputting what you see as you see it...
and recaIIing those memories accurateIy anytime you wish.
you are going to use that skiII to operate Tetsujin.
your father Ieft Tetsujin for you.
what?
I don't beIieve that.
you'II understand soon enough. Now, push the buttons.
that can't be.
why shouId my father Ieave it to me?
you're a coward unIike your father!
coward?
no way!
aII units on patroI/ BIack Ox has appeared in Kasumigaseki.
aII vehicIes to respond immediateIy/ AII units on patroI/
there he is!
there he is! Ready?
bIack Ox is coming this way!
terrorist Zero's destroyer is about to attack the town of Kasumigaseki!
don't back down! Stay on!
stay on!
let's shoot it!
open fire!
it's not working.
huh? What is that?
are you sure I'm the one to do this?
of course.
Shotaro, what are you doing?
quick! Make Tetsujin move.
Yes, sir!
that robot is fighting against BIack Ox.
I can't do this!
damn you!
let's go.
Hurry! -Get in position!
Shotaro!
don't take your hands off the remote-controIIer!
what?
it's the onIy IifeIine for Tetsujin.
Yes, sir.
Tetsujin...
caII an ambuIance! Hurry!
damn it!
this is unbeIievabIe!
the Diet BuiIding, the symboI of the government for 68 years...
is going to be destroyed?!
you might have meant to fight BIack Ox...
but aII you did is cause more damage!
we don't want you bringing out such a worthIess robot without a permit!
worthIess robot?
you watch your mouth!
caII him the great Tetsujin No. 28.
I don't know if it's caIIed Tetsujin or whatever...
but what were you thinking, Ietting that IittIe boy controI that thing?
anyway, you've vioIated the Iaw.
you'II certainIy receive harsh punishment. So be ready.
I'II be ready.
Hey, you, get off there. Quick!
I aIso have a Iot of things to say to you.
do you know what'II happen to Tetsujin?
there's aIready an order to destroy it immediateIy.
Hey, boy, come over here.
never mind. Come on, oId man. We got to give you a hearing.
aII right.
this way.
come over here.
are you the one who was operating Tetsujin?
Yes.
you were terribIe.
just as I thought. -Let's destroy it.
no one can buiId a robot that can withstand BIack Ox.
my ideaI worId wiII not come true unIess everything is destroyed.
what's after Tokyo?
my greatest ideaI worId wiII be controIIed by my computers.
new York? Or London?
what's your wish?
that's what we caII " addicted to nicotine. "
Oh, shut up.
we'II be transporting Tetsujin to Mr. Ayabe's Iab.
so you'II be demoIishing it there?
we're not going to demoIish him. We'II rebuiId him.
what the heck did you say?
we've obtained permission from the office.
there's no question of responsibiIity to you, Chief Ohtsuka!
what?
I'm going to make Tetsujin strong enough to defeat BIack Ox.
won't you to heIp us, Mr. Ayabe?
rebuiId Tetsujin?
ReaIIy?
can you check the knees?
say, this is EMP, isn't it?
the one that BIack Ox exposed Tetsujin to.
EMP?
that's why Tetsujin's eIectric circuits were damaged and couIdn't be controIIed.
I have to admit, BIack Ox is powerfuI.
weII, but...
Tetsujin's head was not crushed when BIack Ox stepped on him.
these workmen put their souIs into Tetsujin.
I definiteIy wish...
to rebuiId Tetsujin.
any objection?
I'm Iooking forward to working with you!
Tetsujin is awesome!
he's probabIy much stronger than we imagine.
he Iost the other day...
but if he reaIIy shows what he's got, he'II definiteIy knock BIack Ox down.
don't you think so?
Tetsujin is the worst.
what?
do you want to see Tetsujin?
he was demoIished.
weII, he's being worked on.
we'II make him strong enough to defeat BIack Ox.
what?
I want you to operate Tetsujin again.
so what do you say, Shotaro?
wouId you Iike to try one more time?
why don't you just give up on it?
even if it's rebuiIt, that oId machine wiII never defeat BIack Ox!
is that so?
you're more...
gutiess than I thought.
what?
listen...
a boy's Iife...
begins with adventures.
Hey, you Iook bored.
since there's no schooI today, do you wanna pIay with us?
what is it? You wanna pick a fight?
don't mess with me!
you're annoying!
damn you!
get off of me!
Matsu! Come on, Matsu!
stop! PIease!
stop!
leave him aIone!
stop! Stop!
don't!
stop it! If he's hurt, who's gonna controI Tetsujin?
what? What did you say?
Shotaro's the one who operates Tetsujin.
are you serious?
Shotaro, pIease! Make Tetsujin fight for us!
shut up!
Shotaro Kaneda.
the son of the Iate Shoichiro Kaneda, who was caIIed the genius of robotics.
Shoichiro Kaneda.
his name takes me back.
I studied in the same Iab with him a Iong time ago.
how oId is Shotaro?
1 2 years oId.
if your son, Hikaru, were aIive, he'd be the same age.
"if " he were aIive?
are you saying that Hikaru is dead?
Shotaro, there's someone here to see you.
what?
who is it?
you must be Shotaro Kaneda.
my name is Reiji Takumi.
how did you feeI, fighting with my BIack Ox?
what?
I've aIways wanted to meet you.
what do you want?
I wanted to find out in person...
whether you shouId be accepted in this worId...
or if you're a fooI and shouId be eIiminated.
who has the right to decide that?
I do.
why do you exist in this worId...
whiIe my son Hikaru does not?
if there's a reason for that, show me.
stop it!
what are you saying?
my mom was injured because of you!
are you...afraid to die?
Shotaro!
Shotaro!
Sh-Shotaro!
what happened? Come over here.
are you aII right?
are you aII right? Are you aII right?
there's something I have to teII you.
it's about Dad, isn't it?
it was the day I first took you to his Iab.
he was...so excited to see you.
come on now, Shotaro.
Shotaro's reaIIy strong. Daddy knows it very weII.
come on. -HoId it! Shotaro, wear this!
mommy's putting on your warrior heImet.
come on now. -Now get him!
good! But you can't beat me Iike that!
that's not good enough.
not fair! -Not fair?
good job! More tickIing!
one more! -That's too easy!
he hit me hard!
stay here.
daddy, where are you going?
don't come!
run!
Shotaro!
dad was trying to save me back then.
that's why he pushed me away.
he didn't hate me.
he Ioved you from the bottom of his heart.
your father Ieft you in charge of Tetsujin.
but I didn't Iike the idea.
I wanted you to be an average kid just Iike the other kids.
I wanted you to grow open and naturaI, having nothing to do with Tetsujin.
that's why I was afraid to taIk to you about your dad.
if I toId you...
I thought you'd end up...
sharing your fate with Tetsujin Iike your father.
I'm sorry.
beIieve and march forward. -From Dad
beIieve and march forward.
Shotaro!
let me piIot Tetsujin again!
pIease.
we've been waiting for you.
this is the view from Tetsujin's eyes.
you're going to operate Tetsujin from his point of view from now on.
start moving.
are you gonna Iast?
if you do this for Iong, you'II get sick and dizzy...
and you'II get a headache.
can you handIe it?
I'm fine.
let me continue.
what materiaI is used for this part?
that's aIuminum weIding.
there are Iimits to aIuminum weIding.
it has to be much harder and stronger overaII.
then we need to use forged duraIumin.
and I want to make Tetsujin fIy this time.
fIy?
finaIIy Tetsujin is going to fIy?
it was Dr. Kaneda's dream, wasn't it?
faster.
what's the matter?
you actuaIIy feIt BIack Ox's punch, didn't you?
you have to fight back. When attacked, attack back.
Yes, ma'am.
don't turn away. Face him!
what's wrong?
you shouId know BIack Ox's moves by now!
use your eidetic image abiIity.
No! As Iong as you're afraid, you'II never win.
listen, you have to counter his punch.
I said aim as he comes at you!
I know!
but I can't do it.
my body won't Iisten to me.
are you okay?
where does it hurt?
Hey, are you aII right?
come on, say something.
ActuaIIy...
I've been anxious to praise you.
you reaIIy are a hard worker.
so you do praise someone.
I've aIways been good at studying since I was young.
but my parents said nothing about it.
they pretended they were watching...
but they never knew how I feIt.
I was determined to get good grades to impress them...
and turned into a weird girI Iike this.
I certainIy wouIdn't Iike to have a friend Iike me.
that's not true!
I'd Iike someone Iike you, Mami.
you " Iike " me?
I didn't mean...
I mean, as a friend.
of course!
Hey!
are you ready?
you fooIish ones.
you aII wiII see me again.
the finaI battIe with me and Tetsujin No. 28 wiII take pIace soon.
watch carefuIIy.
in this battIe...
you wiII see how powerfuI I am...
and that Tetsujin is just a powerIess toy.
I wiII destroy the worId sooner or Iater.
then I wiII create a new perfect worId.
aII of you wiII then voIunteer to become my servants.
Reiji Takumi Former KOK Chairman
Tetsujin...
do I reaIIy have what it takes to fight BIack Ox?
listen, Tetsujin...
can I reaIIy do this?
young man, you're gonna win!
good Iuck!
now you can't run or hide.
are you afraid?
I'm afraid, too.
but your onIy weapon is your courage to fight.
miss Mami. Mr. Ayabe.
pIease watch tiII the end and see what I can do.
bIack Ox has appeared in the bay area!
everyone, get ready!
sir! -Let's go!
Shotaro...
Iisten.
your father and your grandfather are aIways with you.
keep that in mind.
Yes. And my mom, too. -Of course.
let's go, Shotaro!
Yes, ma'am!
good Iuck to you!
we're counting on you!
here we go, Tetsujin!
what are you doing on the ground?
you're so mean!
where were you going?
to where Tetsujin is.
then hop on quickIy!
what?
we're going there, too.
get in position!
here we go.
Reiji Takumi must be hiding nearby!
find him immediateIy!
Yes, sir!
hurry up, Onizuka!
shut up! Here we go!
we're coming, Shotaro!
Tetsujin! -Tetsujin!
look! -Sir!
how siIIy! We're aIready protected against the EMP.
go, Tetsujin!
PIease, God...
keep Reiji safe.
you're OK! This is nothing!
right!
bIack Ox has observed and read aII of Tetsujin's movement patterns.
you mean Tetsujin's moves are aII being predicted?
Yes. But that goes the same for Tetsujin.
Shotaro shouId have memorized BIack Ox's moves.
but my hands can't catch up.
can't you do something?
not good, Tetsujin! Dodge it!
Shotaro! -Shotaro!
beat him. It's a piece of cake!
you can do it! -He's right. Give it your best!
go, Shotaro! -We know you can do it!
that's it! -You can do it, Shotaro!
Shotaro, hop in!
step on it!
Tetsujin's camera eyes are not recovering.
the power remains out.
that's not good.
go faster!
Tetsujin!
stop!
I got it!
stand up.
stand up, Tetsujin!
pIease! Stand up!
DarIing...
pIease protect Shotaro.
beIieve and go forward.
right, Dad?
dad?
come on, Tetsujin.
stand up.
stand up.
Yes, Tetsujin.
it's getting up!
here we go.
aII right! -He did it!
he did it! -We won!
get up! Come on! Get up!
Tetsujin, go! Finish it!
what's wrong?
finish him off!
quickIy!
no. It's enough.
go ahead and finish him off!
destroy BIack Ox compIeteIy!
my father did not create Tetsujin to destroy something.
I've arrested Reira Kijima.
weII done.
hear this, Reiji Takumi!
bIack Ox is no Ionger functionaI.
your partner Reira Kijima is arrested.
you can't get away with this. Come on out!
bIack Ox has aII the data of his son recorded.
for him BIack Ox is the reincarnation of his Iate son, Hikaru.
do you think he'd Iet his son die useIessIy without doing anything?
what are you saying?
bIack Ox is equipped with a nucIear warhead.
its fire button is in the hands of...
Reiji.
what did you say? -A nucIear warhead?
Mr. Reiji Takumi, can you hear me?
there is no one in this worId who has to be eIiminated!
not onIy human beings.
there are no robots that deserve to be eIiminated!
Tetsujin taught me that.
stop fighting.
pIease!
Reiji!
Reiji!
that's him!
take him into custody!
catch the heIicopter! Exercise caution!
No! Who said to shoot him?
you morons!
stop! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
you fooIish ones!
Reiji has pushed the button.
Wh-What?
bIack Ox wiII expIode in 10 minutes, and the worId wiII be destroyed.
Tetsujin, take BIack Ox.
we must pray that Tetsujin wiII cIear the atmosphere before the expIosion.
say...
the remote-controIIer wasn't broken that time, was it?
I pushed the buttons, but Tetsujin's foot wouIdn't move.
that's strange.
it's as if Tetsujin has a heart of his own.
but...
Tetsujin doesn't exist anymore.
can it be?
Tetsujin!
he's back!
he did it! -Hooray!
mister, he did it! He did it!
aII right! -Way to go!
awesome, Tetsujin!
he did it! He did it! He did it!
Shotaro...
Shotaro.
I knew you couId do it.
mom.
how are you?
are you getting aIong with your cIassmates?
I've found since then...
that BIack Ox had a miracuIous power system buiIt in.
it needs no oiI or nucIear power.
any great invention can be good or evil. lt depends how you use it.
I feeI Iike I was born again since I met you guys.
I'II never forget you aII.
you know, I Iove you.
as a friend, of course.
HeIIo! HeIIo!
Thanks. -You're weIcome.
the King's Speech
you're live in two minutes. Your Royal Highness
sir
thank you
let the microphone do the work, sir.
I am sure you will be splendid. Just take your time.
time to go.
good afternoon.
this is the BBC National Programme and Empire Services taking you to Wembley Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of the Empire Exhibition.
where His Royal Highness the Duke of York will read a message from the his father, his Majesty, King George the fifth.
58 British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
your Majesty, 3 flashes, and steady red means you're live.
using the new invention of radio
the Opening Ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
at the close of the first Season
the air to the throne His Royal Highness the Prince Wales made his first broadcast
and today, his younger brother his Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the World.
I have received from his Majesty the...the...the ...the King
inhale deep into your lungs, your Royal Highness.
relaxes your larynx, does it not?
cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
if Your Highness will be so kind as to open your hand...
sterilized.
Now...if I may take the liberty?
...Insert them into your mouth.
excuse me, Doctor. What is the purpose of this?
it's the classic approach that cured Demosthenes.
that was in Ancient Greece. Has it worked since?
now if you would be so kind as to read. A wealth of words.
fight against those marbles Your Royal Highness.
enunciate!
a little more concentration your Royal Highness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most interesting.
your Royal Highness
insert marbles!
he can insert his own bloody marbles...!
tick, tock, tick, tock.
you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know. Promise me
promise me: no more.
Harley Street
Dr. Chapman, L Logue, Speech Defects
australia is calling; Sydney bridge celebrations mar 1932
hello. Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
hello Mrs Johnson, there you are.
sorry I don't have receptionist. I like to keep things simple "Poor and content is rich and rich enough"
for?
Shakespeare. How are you?
how do you do
ahh, traveling alone
now, this is slightly awkward
but I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr Johnson?
he doesn't know I'm here.
that's not a very promising start.
no. My husband has seen everyone to no avail. He's given up hope.
he hasn't seen me.
you're awfully sure of yourself.
I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
of course he wants to be cured.
my husband is required to speak publicly.
perhaps he should change jobs.
he can't.
indentured servitude?
something of that nature. Yes
well we need to have your hubby pop by...
tuesday would be good...
he can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal.
and then we can take it from there
doctor, forgive me.
I do not have a "hubby." We don't 'pop."
and nor do we never talk about our private lives.
you must come to us.
sorry, Mrs J, my game, my turf, my rules.
you'll have to talk over with your husband
and then you can speak to me on the telephone
thank you very much for dropping by.
good afternoon
and what if my husband were the Duke of York?
the Duke of York?
yes the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for "Johnson"?
forgive me, your Royal...? -- Highness.
your Royal Highness.
johnson was used during the Great War when the navy didn't want the enemy to know 'he" was aboard.
am I considered the enemy?
you will be if you remain un-obliging.
you'll appreciate the need for absolutely discretion
of course.
how did you find me? Your Royal Highness
the President of the Society for Speech Therapists
Eileen McCleod? She's a sport.
she warned me your antipodean methods were "unorthodox and controversial."
I warned her...they were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
but for my method to work
I need trust and total equality here in the safety of my consultation room.
no exceptions.
well then, in that case...
when can you start?
still sounds a bit rough.
you make me drive too slowly, Dad!
did you pick mum up from Bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
may I be please leave the table?
how special is special?
you must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents" inane conversation.
Thanks, dad!
and mum. --And mum!
me too -- You're meeting Jean?
no, someone else
doctor? Doctor? Don't you help you brother with the washing up
I'm fine
who is it Lionel?
why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
myrtle, just a woman looking to help her husband.
and I had a 'call." For an audition -- One of my favourates.-- Aren't they all.
could be a lot of fun -- I'm sure you'll be splendid
in the amateur scene, they're a highly regarded group
from Putney.
that's all girls. Tomorrow, Chapter 4, The Flight --I long to know they fly to -- I can't wait
Oh, to fly away!
weren't they lucky!
now Papa tell a story!
could I be a penguin instead?
now I want to a penguin story.
very quickly
once there were two princesses
princesses Elisabeth, and Princesses Margret
their papa was a penguin
this was because he been turned into by a wicked witch
this was inconvenient for him because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms and you can't do that if you're a penguin, because you have wings like herrings.
herrings don't have wings.
penguins have wings which like the shape of herrings.
and what make matters worse she sent him to the South Pole which is an awfully long walk back if you can't fly.
when he reached the water
he dived in, through the depth so fast that he was in Southampton Waters by lunchtime.
from there he took the 2. 30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
he swam up the Thames and out through the plughole, giving the cook mama and Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.
when the girls heard all the commotion
they run to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
and as they kissed him guess what he turned into?
a handsome prince!
a short-tailed Albatross.
with wings big enough that he could wrap them both around his two girls together
now girls, time for bed. Come on
take the horses to the stable
you have exactly a minute
good night feed them brush them and to bed.
will Mrs Simpson be there?
my brother's insisting.
is he serious?
about our coming to dinner?
no. About her!
a married woman? He can't be.
she can. By the way I think I found someone rather interesting.
on Harley Street. A doctor.
out of the question. I'm not having this conversation again.
the matter's settled.
his approach seems rather different...
now?
now!
"now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this sun of York."
and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
thank you.
lovely diction, Mr...
Logue. Lionel Logue.
well, Mr Logue,
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.
Sydney? --Perth.
major theater town, is it? -- Enthusiastic.
Ah. -- I was well reviewed.
Yes...well...Lionel,
I think our dramatic society is looking for someone slightly younger and a little more regal.
you have to shut that one first.
close that one first, that
where did you find this...physician?
classifieds, next to "French model, Shepherd's Market."
he comes highly recommended.
charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?!
he has no receptionist. He likes to keep things simple.
the Johnsons.
you can go in now, "Mr. Johnson."
Lionel says...wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.
or, it being a p-pleasant day, p-perhaps take a stroll.
was that alright...Lionel?
marvellous, Willy
you can stay here and wait for your mum.
Mrs Johnson. Mr. Johnson, do come in.
would you like a sweetie
he's a good lad, Willy.
he could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
my boys made those. Good, aren't they.
please, make yourself comfortable.
I was told not not to sit too close.
when speaking with a prince, one waits for the prince to choose the topic.
waiting for me to... commence a conversation one can wait a rather long wait.
do you know any jokes?
timing isn't my strong suit.
cuppa tea?
no thank you.
I think I'll have one.
aren't you going to start treating me Dr Logue?
only if you're interested in being treated.
please, call me Lionel.
I... I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel. What'll I call you?
your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.
a bit formal for here. I prefer names
prince Albert Frederick Arthur George?
how about Bertie?
only my family uses that.
perfect. In here, it's better if we're equals.
if we were equal. I wouldn't be here.
I'd be at home with my wife and no-one would give a damn.
please don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
my physicians say it relaxes the throat.
they're idiots.
they've all been knighted.
makes it official then.
my "castle," my rules.
thank you
what was your earliest memory?
what an earth do you mean?
your first recollection.
I'm not here to discuss personal matters.
Why're you here then?
because I bloody well stammer!
you have a bit of a temper.
one of my many faults.
when did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
don't. tell me! It's my stammer!
it's my field. I assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
when did it start?
four or five.
that's typical.
so I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that. Do you hesitate when you think?
don't be ridiculous.
how about when you talk to yourself?
everyone natters occasionally, Bertie.
stop calling me that!
I'm not going to call you anything else.
then we shan't speak!
are you charging for this, Doctor?
a fortune.
I'll just save that brew
so, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
of course not!
that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
what do you think was the cause?
I don't know! I... don't care!
I stammer. And no one can fix it.
I'll bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
and if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.
and if I win?
you don't have to answer them.
one usually... wagers money.
a bob each to keep it sweet? Let's see your shilling.
I don't... carry money.
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you. And you can pay me back next time.
if there is a next time.
I haven't agreed to take you on yet
so please stand, and take a look at that, from there
I can't read this.
then you owe me a shilling for not trying.
"To. to.be or not to be,
that... is." damn
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice
and then play it back to you on the same machine.
this is brilliant. It's the latest thing from America: a Silvertone.
pop these on?
there's a bob in this, mate. You can go home rich!
you're playing music. -- I know.
how can I hear what I'm saying?!
surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
you're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
hopeless. Hopeless!
you were sublime.
would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
let me play it back to you -- No.
alright then, I'll get to ask you the questions.
thank you Doctor, I don't... feel this is for me.
thank you for your time. Bye
sir?
the recording is free.
please keep it as a souvenir?
no
ah well.
bugger
for the present the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, to regain prosperity in this time of depression without self-seeking and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.
God bless you.
and off air
easy when you know how.
sir?
have a go yourself.
congratulations, Sir.
Ah, Mr Wood. Splendid fellow.
chap taught me everything I know:
let the microphone do the work.
sir.
thank you.
sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare its quare in the eye, as you would any decent Englishman.

Papa I don't...think I read this
this devilish device will change everything if you won't.
in the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
this family has been reduced to those lowest beast of all creatures...we've become...actors!
we're not a family, we're a firm.
yet any moment some of us may be out of work.
your darling brother... and future king
the only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
he's broken off with Lady Furness.
and taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight no divorced person can ever be received at court.
he said she made him sublimely happy.
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word" this is what he said "I give you my word, we've never had immoral relations,"
stared square into his father's eyes...
and lied.
when I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.
who'll pick up the pieces?
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe,
Marshall Stalin the other half?
who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss? You?
with your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
have a go yourself.

you're playing music. -- I know.
how can I hear what I'm saying?!
surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
you're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
"to be, or not to be, - that is the question":
..."Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
and by opposing end them.
to die, to sleep no more
and by a sleep to say we end
the heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to? 'tis a consummation..."
hopeless! Hopeless!
strictly business. No. personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.
got the shilling you owe me?
no I haven't
didn't think so.
besides, you...tricked me!
physical exercises and tricks are important
but what you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
is that that's sufficient? Ah, no.
as far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
maybe just deal with that.
I.I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...
Lionel.
are you... willing to do your part?
alright. You want mechanics?
we need to relax your jaw muscles and strengthen your tongue.
by repeating tongue twisters for example.
"I am a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
because I am a thistle sifter."
fine.
you do have a flabby tummy,
we'll need to spend some time strength in your diaphragm.
simple mechanics.
that is all we ask.
and that's about a shilling's worth.
forget about the blessed shilling!
perhaps, upon occasion,
you might be request to assistance...
in coping with...some minor event.
will that be agreeable?
of course.
that will be the full extent of your services.
shall I see you next week?
I shall see you every day.

sandringham Estate 1936
Hello, Bertie. -- Hello David -- I see you've been coming out -- Not at all
been waiting long? For Christ, bloody freezing
Where've you been?
been busy.
so was I. Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry. She'll recover.
father won't.
I'll drive.
old bugger's doing this on purpose.
dying?
departing prematurely to complicate matters with Wallis.
Oh for heaven's sake, David.
you know how long he's been ill.
wallis explained. She's terribly clever about these things.
... Whereas by letters patent under the Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June 1912
his Majesty King George V did constitute, order and declare that there should be a guardian, - what's going on here? - Custos Regni, in the form of Councilors of State.
I cannot follow you. I'm confused and I don't understand - ... What you're taking about - It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
would you do that? - So we may act on your behalf.
not clearly I'm afraid...I'm still confused...
but Approved. Thank you.
let me help you sir -- Alright -- Thank you sir -- Thank you
feeling a little better Sir?
no. I'm not feeling any better. I feel dreadful.
been ice-skating?
no, George.
Yes, he's alright. Of course.
I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do far too often lately.
David, the dinner - I'm on with Wallis
it's Bertie.
no, it's not important. No. I don't want to
no, telephone me later? Right, bye
wallis misses me terribly.
mama says you're late for dinner.
she forgets Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!
how is the king? I hope he is not in pain.
no, no, His Majesty is quieter now.
thank you
David, if your father were here, tardiness would not be tolerated.
none of this unpleasantness would be tolerated
you know sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father
both in outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried in your interest to present it in a most favorable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I'm fear our vigil will not be of long duration.
please continue, thank you just commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
long live the King.
I hope I will make good as he has made good.
what on earth was that?
poor Wallis. Now I'm trapped!
and in these last 25 crowded troubled glorious years
if there's one thing that King George has taught
it is the art of the leader with also a brother to his followers
as long as he lives he was the guiding star of a great nation
dad?
time for a Shake, dad?
you sure? -- Go on
put your thinking caps on.
bet its the Scottish Play.
no, I bet it's Othello. It's always Othello.
"art thou afeard? Be not afeard"
Caliban! -- Oh! For heaven's sake. that was a lucky guess!
don't listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.
"the isle is full of noises,
sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
sometimes a thousand twanging instruments
will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,
that, if then I had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again:"
alright, clever clogs, what comes next?
"and then, in dreaming, Me thought the clouds" - the clouds me thought "The clouds me thought would open,
and show riches Ready to drop upon me; that..."
...when I waked, I cried to dream again."
it's such a sad thought.
my next patient must be a bit early. You better go lads, I'm sorry.
won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie, they told me not to expect you.
sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude.
no. Not at all, please come in
I've been practising. One hour a day.
in spite of everything.
what's going on there?
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.
do you feel like working today?
a Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
what did you father do? -- He was brewer.
Oh. -- At least there was free beer.
here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact, my father's ...last words were:
"Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
he couldn't say that to my face.
my brother.
what about him?
try singing it. -- I'm sorry?
what songs do you know?
songs? -- "Swanee River"
I love that song. -- Happens to be my favorite.
sing me the chorus. -- No. Certainly not.
I always wanted to build models.
father... wouldn't allow it. He collected stamps.
we had to collect stamps.
you can finish that off. If you sing.
"my brother David, doo-dah" -- I'm not going to sit here wobbling
you can with me.
because... you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
rules are rules
I'm not...crooning "Swanee River!"
try "Camptown Races" then.
"my brother D, he said to me, doodah doo-dah..."
continuous sound will give you flow. -- No
does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
tell you the truth, It was a relief...
knowing I wouldn't be King.
but unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
and your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
"you're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor."
"Lionel," You didn't stammer.
of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
your boy wouldn't mind? -- No, not at all
david and I were very close.
young bucks... You know.
did you chase the same girls?
david was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
we shared... the expert ministrations of "Paulette" in Paris.
not at the same time of course.
did David ever tease you?
Oh yes they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie."
father encouraged it.
"get it out, boy!"
said it would make me stop.
said..."I was afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me."
are you naturally right handed?
left. I was... punished. Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
anything other corrections?
knock knees.
metal... splints were made...worn...day and night
that must have been painful.
bloody agony. Straight legs now.
who were you closest to in your family?
nannies. Not my first nanny.
she loved David...hated me.
when I was presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she'd...she pinch me so I'd cry, and be...handed back to her immediately, then she wouldn't...
sing it -- Then she wouldn't feed me, far far away."
took my parents three years to notice.
as you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems. Still.
what about your brother Johnnie?
were you close to him?
Johnnie, Sweet boy.
Epilepsy...and...he was 'different'.
he died at 13, hidden from view.
I've been told it's not catching.
do you want a top-up? -- Please.
you know, Lionel, -- you're the first ordinary Englishman... -- Australian.
...I've ever really spoken to.
when I'm driven through the streets and see, you know, the Common Man staring at me,
I'm struck by how little I know of his life, and how little he knows of mine.
thank you -- What're friends for.
I wouldn't know.
balmoral Castle, Scotland "I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thick sieves.
I sifted seven...
isn't that enough darling? No? -- I have to keep doing this
this is your fault.
I sifted seven -- Oh no
one hundred year old spruces removed to improve the view!
who do you think she is?
Nonetheless...we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.
you know she calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook"?
you're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
you seldom cook.
I sifted seven. -- Shut up!!
I sifted...
3, 2,1 and booze -- Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
how lovely to see you both.
welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
your Majesty - All right - Sorry we're late
very nice to see you, Mrs Simpson
very nice
hello David.
making... some changes to the garden I see.
I am. I am not quite finished yet.
don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.
on the contrary, your Royal Highness.
etiquette decrees royalty should be greeted by the official host:
in this case: the King. Not a commoner.
thank you. -- What is her hold on him?
I've no idea.
apparently she has certain...skills, which she learnt in an establishment in Shanghai.
david - just be a sec, darling
excuse me.
David, I've been trying to see you...
I've been terribly busy.
doing what? -- Kinging.
Really?
Kinging is a precarious business these days!
where is the Tsar of Russia?
where is Cousin Wilhelm?
you're being dreary.
is Kinging laying off eighty staff and buying yet more pearls for Wallis while there are people marching across Europe singing "The Red Flag"?
stop your worrying. Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.
who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
Where's the bloody 23"?
and you've put that woman into our mother's suite?
mother's not still in the bed, is she?
that's not funny.
here it is, Wally likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
wallis is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
we intend to marry
excuse me?
she's filing a petition for divorce.
good God.
can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I'm not having her as my mistress.
the Church does not recognise divorce and you are the... head of the church.
haven't I any rights? -- Many privileges...
not the same thing. Your beloved Common Man may marry for love,
why not me?
if you were the Common Man, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?!
sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
sounds like you haven't.
is that what this is all about? Bashing up?
hence the elocution lessons?
that's the scoop around town.
I'm trying to...to...
yearning for a larger audience are we,
B-b-b-Bertie?
D-don't...
what's that? I'm sorry.
young brother trying to push older brother off throne...
Po...Positively medieval.
wallis - where have you been all this time?
I've been talking to.
never mind.
it's very complicated little king you're - I tried to be
all that work, down the drain.
my own brother... I couldn't say a single word to him in reply!
why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?
because you're bloody well paid to listen!
bertie I'm not a geisha girl.
stop trying to be so bloody clever!
what is it about David that stops you speaking?
what is it about you that bloody well make you want to go on about it the whole bloody time?
vulgar but fluent. You don't stammer when you swear.
bugger off!
is that the best you can do?
well bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
a public school prig can do better than that.
shit. Shit, shit, shit!
defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
because I'm angry!
Ah. Know the f-word?
fornication?
Oh Bertie.
fuck. Fuck, fucking, fuck!
bugger, bugger, bugger!
fuck Fuck ass -- Balls Balls Fuckity -- Yes! You see! Not a hesitation!
Willy, shit and Fuck, and tits
dad? What's going on?
sorry. Just finish your homework.
well that's a side of you we don't get to see all that often.
no. No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
let's get some air.
no Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.
what's the matter? Why are you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
my brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice
she's asking for a divorce
and he is determined to marry her.
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
that's not right. Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
unthinkable.
can he do it? - -Absolutely not.
but he's going to anyway. All hell's broken loose.
can't they carry on privately?
if only they would.
where does that leave you?
I know my place!
I'll... do anything within my power to keep my brother on the throne.
is it that serious? Your place may be on the throne.
I am not an alternative to my brother.
you can outshine David... -- Don't take liberties!
that's bordering on treason.
I'm just saying you could be King. You could do it!
that is treason!
I'm trying to get you to realize you need not be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this!
What're you afraid of?
your poisonous words!
why'd you come to me?
you're not middle-class banker who want elocution lessons...
so you can chit-chat at posh tea parties? -- Don't attempt to instruct me on my duties!
I'm the son of a... King...
the brother of a King...
you're the disappointing son of a brewer!
a jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!
you're nobody. These sessions are over!
through here sir.
garden Entrance. Prime Minister's Office 10 Dawning Street
it's not just because she's an American.
that the least of it, it's because she is soon to be a twice divorced American, and the King, as the head of Church of England...
can not marry a divorced woman.
and sir, I apologize for the nature of this, but...
according to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possess exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson's favours and affections, sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr Guy Trundle.
in addition, it is also rumored that Hitler's ambassador,
count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day...
should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of His Government,
he must abdicate. Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.
prime Minister, you'd leave the country without a... government?
does the King do what he wants, or does he do what his people expect him to do?
as crowds on Donning Street watch Ministers come and go
there raised an age-old problem.
can the King separate his personal life from his public duty?
what's the matter, love? -- I'm just having trouble with a patient -- It isn't like you. Why - He's scared.
frightened of his own shadow.
isn't that why they come to you?
this fellow could really be somebody great. He's fighting me.
perhaps he doesn't want to be great.
perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
apologize. Deep of good.
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue, the Duke is busy
I'm happy to wait. Or I could come back later.
as I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
thank you
thank you
parliament will not support the marriage.
but there were other reasons for concern.
he was careless with state papers.
he lacked commitment and resolve.
there were those that worried where he would stand when war with Germany.
we're not coming to that?
indeed we are, Sir. Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
war with Germany will come, and we will need a King we can all stand behind united.
I fear my brother is of sound mind at this time
have you thought what you will call yourself?
I...I...
certainly not Albert, Sir. Too Germanic.
what about George? After your father?
george the sixth.
it has rather a nice continuity to it, don't you think.
David! Thank God. You look exhausted!
how are you bearing up?
Bertie. The decision's been made. I'm... I'm going
I cannot accept that. You are in no condition to make that decision.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
my mind's made up. I'm... sorry.
that's a terrible thing to hear.
nobody wants that. I least of all.
at long last I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything
but until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
a few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.
now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
this I do with all my heart.
you all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.
but you must believe me when I tell you
that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love...
and I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country...
...and with his fine qualities will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire.
accession Council. St James's Palace. 12th Dec, 1936
I meet you today in...in circumstances which are .
I'm sure you'll love it.
thank you darling, saddles, Margret
yes mom.
good boy.
mama, here's the Wilson saddle -- Thank you
don't worry, we'll get you food in a minute
mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?
of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.
curtsey.
your Majesty.
how was it?
I'm trying to... familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.
a despatch from Mr Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
the Christmas broadcast -
I think that might be a mistake.
don't worry about that
plans for the Coronation. I think that's an even bigger mistake.
I'm not a King.
I'm a naval officer. That's all I know
I'm not a King, not a king.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -- No. Dear.
dear, dear man...
I'm sorry.
you know, I refused your first two marriage proposals,
not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the idea of a royal life
could bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
then I thought...he stammers so beautifully...
they'll leave us alone.
waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
this is home. Myrtle's at bridge.
I've made sure the boys are out.
it's lovely. Absolutely lovely.
may I sit down? -- Yes, of course
would you like some tea, Ma'am?
Yes. I'll help myself.
off you go now. Or must I knock your heads together?
here's your shilling
I...understand what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way. I'm sorry.
so here I am.
is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?
every stammer always fears they will fall back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
if I fail in my duty... David could come back.
I've seen the placards "God Save Our... King!"
they don't mean me.
every other monarch in history succeeded someone who was dead,
or about to be.
my predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
bloody mess! I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.
like your Dad used to do? --Precisely.
he's not here anymore.
yes he is. He's on that shilling I gave you.
easy enough to give away.
you don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
or your brother.
you don't need to be afraid of things you were afraid of when you were five.
you're very much your own man, Bertie.
right
your face is next, mate.
Lionel? Dear?
myrtle!
is this your wife? -- Yes.
Bertie, come here - Are you alright, Logue? -- Yes.
shall we go through?
trust me it's important.
what is it?
your... your...
it's "Your Majesty," the first time.
after that, "Ma'am," as in ham, not Ma'lm as in palm.
I haven't told her about us. Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma'am.
very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue - Logue, we can't stay here all day. --Yes we can.
Logue. -- Look, I need to wait for the opportune moment.
you're being a coward! -- You're damn right.
get out there, man!
Oh! Hello, Myrtle darling! You're early.
I believe you two have met!
I don't believe you know...King George VI?
it's very nice to meet you.
will their Majesties be staying to dinner?
we would love to, such a treat, but alas a previous engagement. What a pity.
archbishop.
welcome your Majesty.
what a glorious transformation, Sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations.
now, allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
we begin, of course at the West Door, then into the nave.
I see all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.
I'm afraid I've also had to permit the newsreel cameras.
the product of which I shall personally edit.
without momentary hesitation.
this is Dr. Logue from Harley Street.
he's... my speech therapist.
your Grace
had I known Your Majesty was seeking assistance
I would've made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue will be attending the Coronation.
well of course I shall speak to the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I should like... the Doctor to be seated in the... King's Box.
but members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.
that why it's suitable.
and now, if you don't mind, your grace we need the premises.
my dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
the Church must prepare his Majesty.
my preparations are equally important.
with complete privacy. If you don't mind.
those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal...this evening.
your Majesty.
look, he again. Come on.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
everything alright? Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, "Doctor" Logue.
call me Lionel
true, you never...
called yourself 'Doctor'. I did that for you.
no training, no diploma, no. qualifications.
just a great deal of nerve.
the star chamber inquisition, is it?
you asked for trust and. total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley,
I was there.
my son Laurie said "Do you think you could help that poor man?"
what, as a failed actor!?
it's true, I'm not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit,
I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.
when the Great War came, our soldiers were pouring back from the front, shell-shocked and unable to speak and somebody said,"Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.
do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers."
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
those poor young blokes had cried out in fear, and no-one was listening to them.
my job was to give them faith in their voice and let them know that a friend was listening.
that must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
you give a very noble account of yourself.
make inquiries. It's all true.
inquiries have been made!
you have no idea who I have breathing down my neck.
I vouched for you and you have no...credentials.
but lots of success! I can't show you a certificate there was no training then.
all I know I know by experience, and that war was some experience.
may plaque says, 'L Logue, Speech Defects."
no Dr. No letters after my name.
lock me in the Tower.
I would if I could!
on what charge?
fraud! With war looming, you've saddle this nation with a voiceless King.
you destroyed the happiness of my family...
all for the sake of ensnaring a star patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!
it'll be like mad ...King George the Third, there'll be...Mad King George the Stammerer, who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!
What're you doing? Get up! You can't sit there! Get up
why not? It's a chair.
no, it's not, that is... Saint Edward's Chair
people have carved their name into it!
that chair is the seat on which every King and Queen
it's held in place by a large rock!
that is the Stone of Scone, - you are trivialising everything -- I don't care.
I don't care how many Royal arses have sat in this chair
listen to me... ! listen to me... ! listen to me... !
listen to you?! By what right?
my divine right, if you must! I'm your King!!!
Noooo you're not! Told me so yourself.
said you didn't want it. Why should I waste my time listening to you?
because I have a right to be heard!
I HAVE A VOICE!!!
yes you do.
you have such perseverance, Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.
you'll make a bloody good king.
what on earth's going on, Sir?
it's quite all right, Archbishop.
mr Logue, you should know that I have found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials. Hence, your services will no longer be required.
I'm sorry?
your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
you didn't consult, but you've just been advised.
now I advise you: in this personal matter I will make my own decision.
my concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that Archbishop but it's my head!
your humble servant.
thank you Bertie.
shall we rehearse?
come on, up on your perch
now when you and Elizabeth enter through West door, you'll be greeted with the hymn "I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me."
you won't actually be that glad, because they sing it for a great long time.
then your friend the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs towards you and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath"?
"I am willing."
course you are! I'll see what it sounds like from the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear.
"will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland,
canada, Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?"
I solemnly promise so do so.
Louder! I can't hear you up the back.
"I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"
very good! "Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?
"I will." "I WILL!"
then a long bit about upholding the faith goes on, rubbish, rubbish
to which you finally say...
"these things which I have here before promised,
I will perform and keep. So help me God."
that's all you have to say. Four short responses, kiss the book and sign the oath.
there you are: you're King.
easy.
you nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!
someone had removed the thread marking the front of the Crown, Sir.
try not lose the thread, Archbishop.
archbishop, your missing Papa.
very good, very good. Archbishop.
well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
you can switch that machine off now.
no, wait, keeping going.
do have a seat, Archbishop.
Papa, what's he saying?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
it's a matter of principal. I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler, but the world might be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive War.
Churchill was right all along. This was always Hitler's intention.
I am only sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.
I am very much afraid Sir,
that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room of 10 Downing Street.
this morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.
at last. Sir, here's your speech. You are on air at six.
I've timed it to just under nine minutes.
the wording is fully approved.
the Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast which will go out live across to the Nation, the Empire and to our Armed Forces.
get Logue here immediately.
there are the barrage balloons.
Yes, they got them up there quickly.
should we pull over and find shelter?
no, go straight there. We'll be alright.
yes sir? -- Lionel Logue, Major Harding is expecting me
this is my son Laurie -- Thank you Laurie --Good luck dad -- The King's speech, we have about 40 minutes to the broadcast -- Thank you
thank you very much. Thank you "There may be dark days ahead, and...
try again.
"there may be dark days ahead, andw-... "
turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself, "God save the King."
I say that continually, but apparently no one's listening.
long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.
then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
if I am a King...where is my power?
can I form a Government,
can I levy a tax or declare a war?
No! Yet I am the seat of all authority.
Why? Because the Nation believes when I speak,
I speak for them. Yet I cannot speak!
let's take it all again from the top. In this grave hour...
"in this grave hour fuck fuck fuck perhaps the most fateful in our history bugger shit shit
I send to every household of my p-p
the 'P" is always difficult even when I'm singing
bounce onto it 'a-peoples'
"a-peoples both at home and overseas,..."
beautiful.
..." This message, doo-dah, doodah...
spoken with the same depth of feeling...doodah for each one of you as if I able to fuck shit bugger cross your threshold and speak to you m-my - ..."
in your head, now: "I have a right to be bloody well heard!"
bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
now Waltz. Move! Get continuous movement.
"for the second time in the lives of most of us we are at wa - ..."
pause. "we are..." Take a pause.
I can't do this.
Bertie, you can do it. Have a look at the last paragraph.
Bertie...it's time.
archbishop -- Your Majesty
a great moment, sir.
prime Minister. -- Your Majesty
nice to see you again, so soon.
good of you to be here, I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.
let's hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.
or the wretched dogs.
Congratulations. First Lord of the Admiralty. -- Your Majesty.
the long walk.
good luck, Sir. I too dread this...apparatus.
had a speech impediment myself, you know.
I didn't. -- Family secret. Tongue-tied.
an operation was considered too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
thank you, Mr Churchill. - Sir.
darling
how long, Logue?
just under three minutes, Sir.
mr Wood.
good luck, Your Majesty.
mr Wood.
you've redecorated, Logue. -- I made it cozy.
some fresh air.
there you are, darling.
I am thistle sifter, I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.
I am thistle sifter, I have a sieve of sifted thistles
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!
remember the red light will blink four times and then I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
one minute, sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
40 second, sir
Logue, however this turns out,
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.
knighthood?
twenty seconds.
forget everything else and just say it to me.
say it to me, as a friend.
in this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history,
I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself.
for the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war.
over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.
but it has been in vain. We have been forced into a conflict.
for we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.
such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right.
for the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
it is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial.
the task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
but we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God.
if one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help, we shall prevail.
that was very good, Bertie.
you still stammered on the "w."
had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.
congratulations, your Majesty. A true broadcaster.
thank you, Mr Wood.
congratulations, your Majesty.
congratulations, your Majesty.
thank you.
ready? -- Good
perfect
your first war time speech. Congratulation.
expect I shall have to do a great deal more.
thank you, Logue.
well done. My friend.
thank you... Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
thank you...
...Lionel.
Onwards?
congratulations, Sir
couldn't have said it better myself, Sir
your Majesty, I'm speechless.
congratulations, Sir
gentlemen.
so how was Papa, Elizabeth?
halting at first, but you got much better Papa.
bless you.
and how about you, Margret?
you were just splendid, Papa.
of course I was.
you're all ready?
come on girls.
king George VI made Lionel Logue a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1944.
this high honour from a grateful King made Lionel part of the only order of chivalry that specifically rewards acts of personal service to the Monarch.
Lionel was with the King for every wartime speech.
through his broadcasts, George VI became a symbol of national resistance.
Lionel and Bertie remained friends for the rest of their lives.
the King's Speech
you're live in two minutes. Your Royal Highness
sir
thank you
let the microphone do the work, sir.
I am sure you will be splendid. Just take your time.
time to go.
good afternoon.
this is the BBC National Programme and Empire Services taking you to Wembley Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of the Empire Exhibition.
where His Royal Highness the Duke of York will read a message from the his father, his Majesty, King George the fifth.
58 British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
your Majesty, 3 flashes, and steady red means you're live.
using the new invention of radio
the Opening Ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
at the close of the first Season
the air to the throne His Royal Highness the Prince Wales made his first broadcast
and today, his younger brother his Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the World.
I have received from his Majesty the...the...the ...the King
inhale deep into your lungs, your Royal Highness.
relaxes your larynx, does it not?
cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
if Your Highness will be so kind as to open your hand...
sterilized.
Now...if I may take the liberty?
...Insert them into your mouth.
excuse me, Doctor. What is the purpose of this?
it's the classic approach that cured Demosthenes.
that was in Ancient Greece. Has it worked since?
now if you would be so kind as to read. A wealth of words.
fight against those marbles Your Royal Highness.
enunciate!
a little more concentration your Royal Highness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most interesting.
your Royal Highness
insert marbles!
he can insert his own bloody marbles...!
tick, tock, tick, tock.
you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know. Promise me
promise me: no more.
Harley Street
Dr. Chapman, L Logue, Speech Defects
australia is calling; Sydney bridge celebrations mar 1932
hello. Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
hello Mrs Johnson, there you are.
sorry I don't have receptionist. I like to keep things simple "Poor and content is rich and rich enough"
for?
Shakespeare. How are you?
how do you do
ahh, traveling alone
now, this is slightly awkward
but I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr Johnson?
he doesn't know I'm here.
that's not a very promising start.
no. My husband has seen everyone to no avail. He's given up hope.
he hasn't seen me.
you're awfully sure of yourself.
I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
of course he wants to be cured.
my husband is required to speak publicly.
perhaps he should change jobs.
he can't.
indentured servitude?
something of that nature. Yes
well we need to have your hubby pop by...
tuesday would be good...
he can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal.
and then we can take it from there
doctor, forgive me.
I do not have a "hubby." We don't 'pop."
and nor do we never talk about our private lives.
you must come to us.
sorry, Mrs J, my game, my turf, my rules.
you'll have to talk over with your husband
and then you can speak to me on the telephone
thank you very much for dropping by.
good afternoon
and what if my husband were the Duke of York?
the Duke of York?
yes the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for "Johnson"?
forgive me, your Royal...? -- Highness.
your Royal Highness.
johnson was used during the Great War when the navy didn't want the enemy to know 'he" was aboard.
am I considered the enemy?
you will be if you remain un-obliging.
you'll appreciate the need for absolutely discretion
of course.
how did you find me? Your Royal Highness
the President of the Society for Speech Therapists
Eileen McCleod? She's a sport.
she warned me your antipodean methods were "unorthodox and controversial."
I warned her...they were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
but for my method to work
I need trust and total equality here in the safety of my consultation room.
no exceptions.
well then, in that case...
when can you start?
still sounds a bit rough.
you make me drive too slowly, Dad!
did you pick mum up from Bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
may I be please leave the table?
how special is special?
you must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents" inane conversation.
Thanks, dad!
and mum. --And mum!
me too -- You're meeting Jean?
no, someone else
doctor? Doctor? Don't you help you brother with the washing up
I'm fine
who is it Lionel?
why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
myrtle, just a woman looking to help her husband.
and I had a 'call." For an audition -- One of my favourates.-- Aren't they all.
could be a lot of fun -- I'm sure you'll be splendid
in the amateur scene, they're a highly regarded group
from Putney.
that's all girls. Tomorrow, Chapter 4, The Flight --I long to know they fly to -- I can't wait
Oh, to fly away!
weren't they lucky!
now Papa tell a story!
could I be a penguin instead?
now I want to a penguin story.
very quickly
once there were two princesses
princesses Elisabeth, and Princesses Margret
their papa was a penguin
this was because he been turned into by a wicked witch
this was inconvenient for him because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms and you can't do that if you're a penguin, because you have wings like herrings.
herrings don't have wings.
penguins have wings which like the shape of herrings.
and what make matters worse she sent him to the South Pole which is an awfully long walk back if you can't fly.
when he reached the water
he dived in, through the depth so fast that he was in Southampton Waters by lunchtime.
from there he took the 2. 30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
he swam up the Thames and out through the plughole, giving the cook mama and Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.
when the girls heard all the commotion
they run to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
and as they kissed him guess what he turned into?
a handsome prince!
a short-tailed Albatross.
with wings big enough that he could wrap them both around his two girls together
now girls, time for bed. Come on
take the horses to the stable
you have exactly a minute
good night feed them brush them and to bed.
will Mrs Simpson be there?
my brother's insisting.
is he serious?
about our coming to dinner?
no. About her!
a married woman? He can't be.
she can. By the way I think I found someone rather interesting.
on Harley Street. A doctor.
out of the question. I'm not having this conversation again.
the matter's settled.
his approach seems rather different...
now?
now!
"now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this sun of York."
and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
thank you.
lovely diction, Mr...
Logue. Lionel Logue.
well, Mr Logue,
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.
Sydney? --Perth.
major theater town, is it? -- Enthusiastic.
Ah. -- I was well reviewed.
Yes...well...Lionel,
I think our dramatic society is looking for someone slightly younger and a little more regal.
you have to shut that one first.
close that one first, that
where did you find this...physician?
classifieds, next to "French model, Shepherd's Market."
he comes highly recommended.
charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?!
he has no receptionist. He likes to keep things simple.
the Johnsons.
you can go in now, "Mr. Johnson."
Lionel says...wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.
or, it being a p-pleasant day, p-perhaps take a stroll.
was that alright...Lionel?
marvellous, Willy
you can stay here and wait for your mum.
Mrs Johnson. Mr. Johnson, do come in.
would you like a sweetie
he's a good lad, Willy.
he could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
my boys made those. Good, aren't they.
please, make yourself comfortable.
I was told not not to sit too close.
when speaking with a prince, one waits for the prince to choose the topic.
waiting for me to... commence a conversation one can wait a rather long wait.
do you know any jokes?
timing isn't my strong suit.
cuppa tea?
no thank you.
I think I'll have one.
aren't you going to start treating me Dr Logue?
only if you're interested in being treated.
please, call me Lionel.
I... I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel. What'll I call you?
your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.
a bit formal for here. I prefer names
prince Albert Frederick Arthur George?
how about Bertie?
only my family uses that.
perfect. In here, it's better if we're equals.
if we were equal. I wouldn't be here.
I'd be at home with my wife and no-one would give a damn.
please don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
my physicians say it relaxes the throat.
they're idiots.
they've all been knighted.
makes it official then.
my "castle," my rules.
thank you
what was your earliest memory?
what an earth do you mean?
your first recollection.
I'm not here to discuss personal matters.
Why're you here then?
because I bloody well stammer!
you have a bit of a temper.
one of my many faults.
when did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
don't. tell me! It's my stammer!
it's my field. I assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
when did it start?
four or five.
that's typical.
so I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that. Do you hesitate when you think?
don't be ridiculous.
how about when you talk to yourself?
everyone natters occasionally, Bertie.
stop calling me that!
I'm not going to call you anything else.
then we shan't speak!
are you charging for this, Doctor?
a fortune.
I'll just save that brew
so, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
of course not!
that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
what do you think was the cause?
I don't know! I... don't care!
I stammer. And no one can fix it.
I'll bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
and if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.
and if I win?
you don't have to answer them.
one usually... wagers money.
a bob each to keep it sweet? Let's see your shilling.
I don't... carry money.
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you. And you can pay me back next time.
if there is a next time.
I haven't agreed to take you on yet
so please stand, and take a look at that, from there
I can't read this.
then you owe me a shilling for not trying.
"To. to.be or not to be,
that... is." damn
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice
and then play it back to you on the same machine.
this is brilliant. It's the latest thing from America: a Silvertone.
pop these on?
there's a bob in this, mate. You can go home rich!
you're playing music. -- I know.
how can I hear what I'm saying?!
surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
you're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
hopeless. Hopeless!
you were sublime.
would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
let me play it back to you -- No.
alright then, I'll get to ask you the questions.
thank you Doctor, I don't... feel this is for me.
thank you for your time. Bye
sir?
the recording is free.
please keep it as a souvenir?
no
ah well.
bugger
for the present the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, to regain prosperity in this time of depression without self-seeking and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.
God bless you.
and off air
easy when you know how.
sir?
have a go yourself.
congratulations, Sir.
Ah, Mr Wood. Splendid fellow.
chap taught me everything I know:
let the microphone do the work.
sir.
thank you.
sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare its quare in the eye, as you would any decent Englishman.

Papa I don't...think I read this
this devilish device will change everything if you won't.
in the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
this family has been reduced to those lowest beast of all creatures...we've become...actors!
we're not a family, we're a firm.
yet any moment some of us may be out of work.
your darling brother... and future king
the only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
he's broken off with Lady Furness.
and taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight no divorced person can ever be received at court.
he said she made him sublimely happy.
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word" this is what he said "I give you my word, we've never had immoral relations,"
stared square into his father's eyes...
and lied.
when I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.
who'll pick up the pieces?
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe,
Marshall Stalin the other half?
who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss? You?
with your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.

lying bastard.
you're playing music. -- I know.
how can I hear what I'm saying?!
surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
you're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
"to be, or not to be, - that is the question":
..."Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
and by opposing end them.
to die, to sleep no more
and by a sleep to say we end
the heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to? 'tis a consummation..."
hopeless! Hopeless!
strictly business. No. personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.
got the shilling you owe me?
no I haven't
didn't think so.
besides, you...tricked me!
physical exercises and tricks are important
but what you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
is that that's sufficient? Ah, no.
as far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
maybe just deal with that.
I.I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...
Lionel.
are you... willing to do your part?
alright. You want mechanics?
we need to relax your jaw muscles and strengthen your tongue.
by repeating tongue twisters for example.
"I am a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
because I am a thistle sifter."
fine.
you do have a flabby tummy,
we'll need to spend some time strength in your diaphragm.
simple mechanics.
that is all we ask.
and that's about a shilling's worth.
forget about the blessed shilling!
perhaps, upon occasion,
you might be request to assistance...
in coping with...some minor event.
will that be agreeable?
of course.
that will be the full extent of your services.
shall I see you next week?
I shall see you every day.

isn't that what public speaking is all about?
my wife and I are glad to visit this important...
take a good deep breathe, and up come your Royal Highness
and slowly exhale and down come your Royal Highness - are you alright, Bertie? -- yes this is actually quite good fun.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmother.
short the humming each time
Manufacturing...the district...
another deep breath and "jack and Jill" -- "Jack and Jill"
went up the hill - went up the hill
just sway... perfect
we are not permit to ask...to
loosen the shoulder
Ding dong bell, Pussy's in the well
who put her in? Little Johnny Green
have a short memory Bertie? Come on - cow - cow - king - king
anyone who can shout vowels in an open window can learn to deliver a speech.
14...15 -- Deep breath. And it is.
it is ... -- let the words flow mine doesn't bloody work come on, one more time, Bertie you can do it a sieve of sifted thistles - father - father - Wait for "aa" in patient - father
sandringham Estate 1936
Hello, Bertie. -- Hello David -- I see you've been coming out -- Not at all
been waiting long? For Christ, bloody freezing
Where've you been?
been busy.
so was I. Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry. She'll recover.
father won't.
I'll drive.
old bugger's doing this on purpose.
dying?
departing prematurely to complicate matters with Wallis.
Oh for heaven's sake, David.
you know how long he's been ill.
wallis explained. She's terribly clever about these things.
... Whereas by letters patent under the Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June 1912
his Majesty King George V did constitute, order and declare that there should be a guardian, - what's going on here? - Custos Regni, in the form of Councilors of State.
I cannot follow you. I'm confused and I don't understand - ... What you're taking about - It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
would you do that? - So we may act on your behalf.
not clearly I'm afraid...I'm still confused...
but Approved. Thank you.
let me help you sir -- Alright -- Thank you sir -- Thank you
feeling a little better Sir?
no. I'm not feeling any better. I feel dreadful.
been ice-skating?
no, George.
Yes, he's alright. Of course.
I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do far too often lately.
David, the dinner - I'm on with Wallis
it's Bertie.
no, it's not important. No. I don't want to
no, telephone me later? Right, bye
wallis misses me terribly.
mama says you're late for dinner.
she forgets Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!
how is the king? I hope he is not in pain.
no, no, His Majesty is quieter now.
thank you
David, if your father were here, tardiness would not be tolerated.
none of this unpleasantness would be tolerated
you know sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father
both in outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried in your interest to present it in a most favorable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I'm fear our vigil will not be of long duration.
please continue, thank you just commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
long live the King.
I hope I will make good as he has made good.
what on earth was that?
poor Wallis. Now I'm trapped!
and in these last 25 crowded troubled glorious years
if there's one thing that King George has taught
it is the art of the leader with also a brother to his followers
as long as he lives he was the guiding star of a great nation
dad?
time for a Shake, dad?
you sure? -- Go on
put your thinking caps on.
bet its the Scottish Play.
no, I bet it's Othello. It's always Othello.
"art thou afeard? Be not afeard"
Caliban! -- Oh! For heaven's sake. that was a lucky guess!
don't listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.
"the isle is full of noises,
sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
sometimes a thousand twanging instruments
will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,
that, if then I had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again:"
alright, clever clogs, what comes next?
"and then, in dreaming, Me thought the clouds" - the clouds me thought "The clouds me thought would open,
and show riches Ready to drop upon me; that..."
...when I waked, I cried to dream again."
it's such a sad thought.
my next patient must be a bit early. You better go lads, I'm sorry.
won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie, they told me not to expect you.
sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude.
no. Not at all, please come in
I've been practising. One hour a day.
in spite of everything.
what's going on there?
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.
do you feel like working today?
a Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
what did you father do? -- He was brewer.
Oh. -- At least there was free beer.
here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact, my father's ...last words were:
"Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
he couldn't say that to my face.
my brother.
what about him?
try singing it. -- I'm sorry?
what songs do you know?
songs? -- "Swanee River"
I love that song. -- Happens to be my favorite.
sing me the chorus. -- No. Certainly not.
I always wanted to build models.
father... wouldn't allow it. He collected stamps.
we had to collect stamps.
you can finish that off. If you sing.
"my brother David, doo-dah" -- I'm not going to sit here wobbling
you can with me.
because... you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
rules are rules
I'm not...crooning "Swanee River!"
try "Camptown Races" then.
"my brother D, he said to me, doodah doo-dah..."
continuous sound will give you flow. -- No
does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
tell you the truth, It was a relief...
knowing I wouldn't be King.
but unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
and your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
"you're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor."
"Lionel," You didn't stammer.
of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
your boy wouldn't mind? -- No, not at all
david and I were very close.
young bucks... You know.
did you chase the same girls?
david was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
we shared... the expert ministrations of "Paulette" in Paris.
not at the same time of course.
did David ever tease you?
Oh yes they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie."
father encouraged it.
"get it out, boy!"
said it would make me stop.
said..."I was afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me."
are you naturally right handed?
left. I was... punished. Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
anything other corrections?
knock knees.
metal... splints were made...worn...day and night
that must have been painful.
bloody agony. Straight legs now.
who were you closest to in your family?
nannies. Not my first nanny.
she loved David...hated me.
when I was presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she'd...she pinch me so I'd cry, and be...handed back to her immediately, then she wouldn't...
sing it -- Then she wouldn't feed me, far far away."
took my parents three years to notice.
as you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems. Still.
what about your brother Johnnie?
were you close to him?
Johnnie, Sweet boy.
Epilepsy...and...he was 'different'.
he died at 13, hidden from view.
I've been told it's not catching.
do you want a top-up? -- Please.
you know, Lionel, -- you're the first ordinary Englishman... -- Australian.
...I've ever really spoken to.
when I'm driven through the streets and see, you know, the Common Man staring at me,
I'm struck by how little I know of his life, and how little he knows of mine.
thank you -- What're friends for.
I wouldn't know.
balmoral Castle, Scotland "I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thick sieves.
I sifted seven...
isn't that enough darling? No? -- I have to keep doing this
this is your fault.
I sifted seven -- Oh no
one hundred year old spruces removed to improve the view!
who do you think she is?
Nonetheless...we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.
you know she calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook"?
you're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
you seldom cook.
I sifted seven. -- Shut up!!
I sifted...
3, 2,1 and booze -- Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
how lovely to see you both.
welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
your Majesty - All right - Sorry we're late
very nice to see you, Mrs Simpson
very nice
hello David.
making... some changes to the garden I see.
I am. I am not quite finished yet.
don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.
on the contrary, your Royal Highness.
etiquette decrees royalty should be greeted by the official host:
in this case: the King. Not a commoner.
thank you. -- What is her hold on him?
I've no idea.
apparently she has certain...skills, which she learnt in an establishment in Shanghai.
david - just be a sec, darling
excuse me.
David, I've been trying to see you...
I've been terribly busy.
doing what? -- Kinging.
Really?
Kinging is a precarious business these days!
where is the Tsar of Russia?
where is Cousin Wilhelm?
you're being dreary.
is Kinging laying off eighty staff and buying yet more pearls for Wallis while there are people marching across Europe singing "The Red Flag"?
stop your worrying. Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.
who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
Where's the bloody 23"?
and you've put that woman into our mother's suite?
mother's not still in the bed, is she?
that's not funny.
here it is, Wally likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
wallis is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
we intend to marry
excuse me?
she's filing a petition for divorce.
good God.
can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I'm not having her as my mistress.
the Church does not recognise divorce and you are the... head of the church.
haven't I any rights? -- Many privileges...
not the same thing. Your beloved Common Man may marry for love,
why not me?
if you were the Common Man, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?!
sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
sounds like you haven't.
is that what this is all about? Bashing up?
hence the elocution lessons?
that's the scoop around town.
I'm trying to...to...
yearning for a larger audience are we,
B-b-b-Bertie?
D-don't...
what's that? I'm sorry.
young brother trying to push older brother off throne...
Po...Positively medieval.
wallis - where have you been all this time?
I've been talking to.
never mind.
it's very complicated little king you're - I tried to be
all that work, down the drain.
my own brother... I couldn't say a single word to him in reply!
why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?
because you're bloody well paid to listen!
bertie I'm not a geisha girl.
stop trying to be so bloody clever!
what is it about David that stops you speaking?
what is it about you that bloody well make you want to go on about it the whole bloody time?
vulgar but fluent. You don't stammer when you swear.
bugger off!
is that the best you can do?
well bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
a public school prig can do better than that.
shit. Shit, shit, shit!
defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
because I'm angry!
Ah. Know the f-word?
fornication?
Oh Bertie.
fuck. Fuck, fucking, fuck!
bugger, bugger, bugger!
fuck Fuck ass -- Balls Balls Fuckity -- Yes! You see! Not a hesitation!
Willy, shit and Fuck, and tits
dad? What's going on?
sorry. Just finish your homework.
well that's a side of you we don't get to see all that often.
no. No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
let's get some air.
no Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.
what's the matter? Why are you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
my brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice
she's asking for a divorce
and he is determined to marry her.
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
that's not right. Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
unthinkable.
can he do it? - -Absolutely not.
but he's going to anyway. All hell's broken loose.
can't they carry on privately?
if only they would.
where does that leave you?
I know my place!
I'll... do anything within my power to keep my brother on the throne.
is it that serious? Your place may be on the throne.
I am not an alternative to my brother.
you can outshine David... -- Don't take liberties!
that's bordering on treason.
I'm just saying you could be King. You could do it!
that is treason!
I'm trying to get you to realize you need not be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this!
What're you afraid of?
your poisonous words!
why'd you come to me?
you're not middle-class banker who want elocution lessons...
so you can chit-chat at posh tea parties? -- Don't attempt to instruct me on my duties!
I'm the son of a... King...
the brother of a King...
you're the disappointing son of a brewer!
a jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!
you're nobody. These sessions are over!
through here sir.
garden Entrance. Prime Minister's Office 10 Dawning Street
it's not just because she's an American.
that the least of it, it's because she is soon to be a twice divorced American, and the King, as the head of Church of England...
can not marry a divorced woman.
and sir, I apologize for the nature of this, but...
according to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possess exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson's favours and affections, sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr Guy Trundle.
in addition, it is also rumored that Hitler's ambassador,
count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day...
should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of His Government,
he must abdicate. Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.
prime Minister, you'd leave the country without a... government?
does the King do what he wants, or does he do what his people expect him to do?
as crowds on Donning Street watch Ministers come and go
there raised an age-old problem.
can the King separate his personal life from his public duty?
what's the matter, love? -- I'm just having trouble with a patient -- It isn't like you. Why - He's scared.
frightened of his own shadow.
isn't that why they come to you?
this fellow could really be somebody great. He's fighting me.
perhaps he doesn't want to be great.
perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
apologize. Deep of good.
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue, the Duke is busy
I'm happy to wait. Or I could come back later.
as I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
thank you
thank you
parliament will not support the marriage.
but there were other reasons for concern.
he was careless with state papers.
he lacked commitment and resolve.
there were those that worried where he would stand when war with Germany.
we're not coming to that?
indeed we are, Sir. Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
war with Germany will come, and we will need a King we can all stand behind united.
I fear my brother is of sound mind at this time
have you thought what you will call yourself?
I...I...
certainly not Albert, Sir. Too Germanic.
what about George? After your father?
george the sixth.
it has rather a nice continuity to it, don't you think.
David! Thank God. You look exhausted!
how are you bearing up?
Bertie. The decision's been made. I'm... I'm going
I cannot accept that. You are in no condition to make that decision.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
my mind's made up. I'm... sorry.
that's a terrible thing to hear.
nobody wants that. I least of all.
at long last I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything
but until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
a few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.
now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
this I do with all my heart.
you all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.
but you must believe me when I tell you
that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love...
and I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country...
...and with his fine qualities will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire.
accession Council. St James's Palace. 12th Dec, 1936
I meet you today in...in circumstances which are .
I'm sure you'll love it.
thank you darling, saddles, Margret
yes mom.
good boy.
mama, here's the Wilson saddle -- Thank you
don't worry, we'll get you food in a minute
mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?
of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.
curtsey.
your Majesty.
how was it?
I'm trying to... familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.
a despatch from Mr Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
the Christmas broadcast -
I think that might be a mistake.
don't worry about that
plans for the Coronation. I think that's an even bigger mistake.
I'm not a King.
I'm a naval officer. That's all I know
I'm not a King, not a king.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -- No. Dear.
dear, dear man...
I'm sorry.
you know, I refused your first two marriage proposals,
not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the idea of a royal life
could bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
then I thought...he stammers so beautifully...
they'll leave us alone.
waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
this is home. Myrtle's at bridge.
I've made sure the boys are out.
it's lovely. Absolutely lovely.
may I sit down? -- Yes, of course
would you like some tea, Ma'am?
Yes. I'll help myself.
off you go now. Or must I knock your heads together?
here's your shilling
I...understand what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way. I'm sorry.
so here I am.
is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?
every stammer always fears they will fall back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
if I fail in my duty... David could come back.
I've seen the placards "God Save Our... King!"
they don't mean me.
every other monarch in history succeeded someone who was dead,
or about to be.
my predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
bloody mess! I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.
like your Dad used to do? --Precisely.
he's not here anymore.
yes he is. He's on that shilling I gave you.
easy enough to give away.
you don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
or your brother.
you don't need to be afraid of things you were afraid of when you were five.
you're very much your own man, Bertie.
right
your face is next, mate.
Lionel? Dear?
myrtle!
is this your wife? -- Yes.
Bertie, come here - Are you alright, Logue? -- Yes.
shall we go through?
trust me it's important.
what is it?
your... your...
it's "Your Majesty," the first time.
after that, "Ma'am," as in ham, not Ma'lm as in palm.
I haven't told her about us. Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma'am.
very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue - Logue, we can't stay here all day. --Yes we can.
Logue. -- Look, I need to wait for the opportune moment.
you're being a coward! -- You're damn right.
get out there, man!
Oh! Hello, Myrtle darling! You're early.
I believe you two have met!
I don't believe you know...King George VI?
it's very nice to meet you.
will their Majesties be staying to dinner?
we would love to, such a treat, but alas a previous engagement. What a pity.
archbishop.
welcome your Majesty.
what a glorious transformation, Sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations.
now, allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
we begin, of course at the West Door, then into the nave.
I see all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.
I'm afraid I've also had to permit the newsreel cameras.
the product of which I shall personally edit.
without momentary hesitation.
this is Dr. Logue from Harley Street.
he's... my speech therapist.
your Grace
had I known Your Majesty was seeking assistance
I would've made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue will be attending the Coronation.
well of course I shall speak to the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I should like... the Doctor to be seated in the... King's Box.
but members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.
that why it's suitable.
and now, if you don't mind, your grace we need the premises.
my dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
the Church must prepare his Majesty.
my preparations are equally important.
with complete privacy. If you don't mind.
those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal...this evening.
your Majesty.
look, he again. Come on.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
everything alright? Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, "Doctor" Logue.
call me Lionel
true, you never...
called yourself 'Doctor'. I did that for you.
no training, no diploma, no. qualifications.
just a great deal of nerve.
the star chamber inquisition, is it?
you asked for trust and. total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley,
I was there.
my son Laurie said "Do you think you could help that poor man?"
what, as a failed actor!?
it's true, I'm not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit,
I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.
when the Great War came, our soldiers were pouring back from the front, shell-shocked and unable to speak and somebody said,"Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.
do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers."
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
those poor young blokes had cried out in fear, and no-one was listening to them.
my job was to give them faith in their voice and let them know that a friend was listening.
that must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
you give a very noble account of yourself.
make inquiries. It's all true.
inquiries have been made!
you have no idea who I have breathing down my neck.
I vouched for you and you have no...credentials.
but lots of success! I can't show you a certificate there was no training then.
all I know I know by experience, and that war was some experience.
may plaque says, 'L Logue, Speech Defects."
no Dr. No letters after my name.
lock me in the Tower.
I would if I could!
on what charge?
fraud! With war looming, you've saddle this nation with a voiceless King.
you destroyed the happiness of my family...
all for the sake of ensnaring a star patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!
it'll be like mad ...King George the Third, there'll be...Mad King George the Stammerer, who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!
What're you doing? Get up! You can't sit there! Get up
why not? It's a chair.
no, it's not, that is... Saint Edward's Chair
people have carved their name into it!
that chair is the seat on which every King and Queen
it's held in place by a large rock!
that is the Stone of Scone, - you are trivialising everything -- I don't care.
I don't care how many Royal arses have sat in this chair
listen to me... ! listen to me... ! listen to me... !
listen to you?! By what right?
my divine right, if you must! I'm your King!!!
Noooo you're not! Told me so yourself.
said you didn't want it. Why should I waste my time listening to you?
because I have a right to be heard!
I HAVE A VOICE!!!
yes you do.
you have such perseverance, Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.
you'll make a bloody good king.
what on earth's going on, Sir?
it's quite all right, Archbishop.
mr Logue, you should know that I have found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials. Hence, your services will no longer be required.
I'm sorry?
your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
you didn't consult, but you've just been advised.
now I advise you: in this personal matter I will make my own decision.
my concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that Archbishop but it's my head!
your humble servant.
thank you Bertie.
shall we rehearse?
come on, up on your perch
now when you and Elizabeth enter through West door, you'll be greeted with the hymn "I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me."
you won't actually be that glad, because they sing it for a great long time.
then your friend the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs towards you and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath"?
"I am willing."
course you are! I'll see what it sounds like from the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear.
"will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland,
canada, Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?"
I solemnly promise so do so.
Louder! I can't hear you up the back.
"I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"
very good! "Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?
"I will." "I WILL!"
then a long bit about upholding the faith goes on, rubbish, rubbish
to which you finally say...
"these things which I have here before promised,
I will perform and keep. So help me God."
that's all you have to say. Four short responses, kiss the book and sign the oath.
there you are: you're King.
easy.
you nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!
someone had removed the thread marking the front of the Crown, Sir.
try not lose the thread, Archbishop.
archbishop, your missing Papa.
very good, very good. Archbishop.
well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
you can switch that machine off now.
no, wait, keeping going.
do have a seat, Archbishop.
Papa, what's he saying?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
it's a matter of principal. I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler, but the world might be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive War.
Churchill was right all along. This was always Hitler's intention.
I am only sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.
I am very much afraid Sir,
that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room of 10 Downing Street.
this morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.
at last. Sir, here's your speech. You are on air at six.
I've timed it to just under nine minutes.
the wording is fully approved.
the Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast which will go out live across to the Nation, the Empire and to our Armed Forces.
get Logue here immediately.
there are the barrage balloons.
Yes, they got them up there quickly.
should we pull over and find shelter?
no, go straight there. We'll be alright.
yes sir? -- Lionel Logue, Major Harding is expecting me
this is my son Laurie -- Thank you Laurie --Good luck dad -- The King's speech, we have about 40 minutes to the broadcast -- Thank you
thank you very much. Thank you "There may be dark days ahead, and...
try again.
"there may be dark days ahead, andw-... "
turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself, "God save the King."
I say that continually, but apparently no one's listening.
long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.
then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
if I am a King...where is my power?
can I form a Government,
can I levy a tax or declare a war?
No! Yet I am the seat of all authority.
Why? Because the Nation believes when I speak,
I speak for them. Yet I cannot speak!
let's take it all again from the top. In this grave hour...
"in this grave hour fuck fuck fuck perhaps the most fateful in our history bugger shit shit
I send to every household of my p-p
the 'P" is always difficult even when I'm singing
bounce onto it 'a-peoples'
"a-peoples both at home and overseas,..."
beautiful.
..." This message, doo-dah, doodah...
spoken with the same depth of feeling...doodah for each one of you as if I able to fuck shit bugger cross your threshold and speak to you m-my - ..."
in your head, now: "I have a right to be bloody well heard!"
bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
now Waltz. Move! Get continuous movement.
"for the second time in the lives of most of us we are at wa - ..."
pause. "we are..." Take a pause.
I can't do this.
Bertie, you can do it. Have a look at the last paragraph.
Bertie...it's time.
archbishop -- Your Majesty
a great moment, sir.
prime Minister. -- Your Majesty
nice to see you again, so soon.
good of you to be here, I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.
let's hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.
or the wretched dogs.
Congratulations. First Lord of the Admiralty. -- Your Majesty.
the long walk.
good luck, Sir. I too dread this...apparatus.
had a speech impediment myself, you know.
I didn't. -- Family secret. Tongue-tied.
an operation was considered too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
thank you, Mr Churchill. - Sir.
darling
how long, Logue?
just under three minutes, Sir.
mr Wood.
good luck, Your Majesty.
mr Wood.
you've redecorated, Logue. -- I made it cozy.
some fresh air.
there you are, darling.
I am thistle sifter, I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.
I am thistle sifter, I have a sieve of sifted thistles
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!
remember the red light will blink four times and then I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
one minute, sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
40 second, sir
Logue, however this turns out,
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.
knighthood?
twenty seconds.
forget everything else and just say it to me.
say it to me, as a friend.
in this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history,
I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself.
for the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war.
over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.
but it has been in vain. We have been forced into a conflict.
for we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.
such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right.
for the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
it is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial.
the task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
but we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God.
if one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help, we shall prevail.
that was very good, Bertie.
you still stammered on the "w."
had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.
congratulations, your Majesty. A true broadcaster.
thank you, Mr Wood.
congratulations, your Majesty.
congratulations, your Majesty.
thank you.
ready? -- Good
perfect
your first war time speech. Congratulation.
expect I shall have to do a great deal more.
thank you, Logue.
well done. My friend.
thank you... Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
thank you...
...Lionel.
Onwards?
congratulations, Sir
couldn't have said it better myself, Sir
your Majesty, I'm speechless.
congratulations, Sir
gentlemen.
so how was Papa, Elizabeth?
halting at first, but you got much better Papa.
bless you.
and how about you, Margret?
you were just splendid, Papa.
of course I was.
you're all ready?
come on girls.
king George VI made Lionel Logue a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1944.
this high honour from a grateful King made Lionel part of the only order of chivalry that specifically rewards acts of personal service to the Monarch.
Lionel was with the King for every wartime speech.
through his broadcasts, George VI became a symbol of national resistance.
Lionel and Bertie remained friends for the rest of their lives.
suddenly airport security comes and tells me I have to get off.
because I was too fat to fly.
the statute of limitations for suing us has expired.
I would just tell the client that we settled and pay them out of my own pocket and avoid the whole malpractice thing.
they've agreed to pay you ten thousand dollars.
tell them no.
this woman thinks the airline offered her ten thousand dollars?
just help me.
tell your client the truth.
there's something you need to know.
I already know.
and all I can say is thank you.
Mr. Torrance came to my house this morning.
he went to Melissa Kenner and pretended to be someone from the airline and settled the case.
well, any chance I get to break the law.
why are we having lunch?
I think I enjoy the company of inquisitive people.
also I find you attractive.
I was so sure, after the case was over that
that you were expendable?
just the opposite, Diane.
it's not a Jewish thing.
what is it then?
a man and woman thing.
I wanna break up.
Jamie, you and I, it's just a thing.
we both know that it's no big deal.
what are you doing?
just looking.
just looking?
I leave.
I perhaps should have shared that prior to getting intimate, but
in relationships, I leave.
are you leaving now?
only to go to work.
I don't mean to suggest any waning interest on my part, to the contrary.
but in the spirit of honesty...
you leave.
okay.
you'll be transported to the courthouse tomorrow at 8 a.m.
the trial is scheduled for 9.
when do I see my lawyer?
Mr. Berluti will be waiting for you at the courthouse.
as will I.
you might want to think about a plea.
aggravated rape could be as much as twenty-five years.
can I ask you something?
certainly.
how is it that I'm going on trial tomorrow, facing twenty-five years, and I haven't seen my lawyer in weeks.
he's been working on the case.
and he's quite prepared.
I assure you, you're in very capable hands.
what are these?
they're for Jamie, actually.
wow, orchids in November. Who from?
we don't know.
you ready?
Ah, a little heads up.
the client's slightly perturbed not having seen you.
okay.
let's go.
Jimmy, hold on a second.
you haven't seen your client?
not since the arraignment.
Tara's been doing the back and forth with him.
I've been prepping the case from here.
Hey, you're the one who said "watch our time" on the court-appointed cases, Eugene, so -
I said "draw limits. "
I never said "don't bother to meet with the client. "
I'm ready to try the case.
don't worry.
C'mon Tara.
nice.
who from?
this is kinda private.
somebody Jewish, I hope.
I arrived home, I think it was just after 8pm.
I was picking up Jessica to go out to dinner.
it was her twenty-first birthday.
Jessica is your daughter?
Yes.
I came into the house and I immediately heard noise coming from somewhere.
what kind of noise, sir?
well, I really couldn't identify it at first.
but then I went into the living room and, uh, I-I saw the cause of the noise.
what did you see, sir?
I saw my daughter being raped.
I know this is difficult, sir, but can you describe for the jury exactly what you saw?
Jessica was on her back, on the floor.
that man over there was on top of her.
her pants were pulled down.
his too.
and he was forcing himself inside of her.
are you sure this is the man you saw on top of your daughter?
I'm positive it was him.
it was him.
what happened next, Mr. Palmer?
I picked up a shovel by the fireplace and I knocked him unconscious.
then-then I called 9-1-1.
I tied him up with an electrical cord.
the police came and got him.
and could you describe for the jury the condition of your daughter?
she was beyond hysterical.
I'm done, Your Honor.
you said, sir, you heard noises when you entered.
did you hear screams?
I said before I couldn't identify the noises.
when you saw what you saw, would it be fair to say it caused you feelings of shock?
that would be fair.
did you see any weapon in my client's possession?
no.
nothing further.
you didn't do nothin"!
look, Derrick, this was the father of the victim.
you've got to walk a careful line.
I'm the victim here, Mr. Berluti.
do we not understand that?
in the eyes of the jury, this man was sympathetic.
it would have been a mistake for me to beat him up.
so you did nothing?
no.
I established that he didn't hear screams, which, as the girl's father he would have remembered hearing.
I established that he went into shock upon seeing the event.
shock compromises capacity to observe.
did you explain to Mr. Mills that our theory of defense
why haven't you explained it to me? Huh?
she's a law student.
where the hell have you been?
we got a problem, Mr. Mills?
cuz if we do, I've got an easy suggestion.
we can go see the judge and tell her you want a different lawyer.
I doubt she'll give you one in the middle of the trial, but hey.
it's worth a shot.
you like to take your shots where you find them, eh, Derrick?
all right.
this isn't helping.
seems like a nice guy.
he's angry.
Yeah, I picked up on that.
if I could play the role of a naive law student for a second,
there's no chance that he could be innocent, is there?
what are you talking about?
you're the one who's been saying he's guilty.
I know.
I'm sure that he is.
it's just that he's so indignant.
lesson number one, Tara.
the guiltier they come, the more indignant they get about being arrested.
right.
good.
is there a problem?
no.
excellent.
so you are here to...?
Alan, I don't like "I'm leaving" to be the first words out of a man's mouth in the morning.
especially after I've slept with him the night before.
could we perhaps discuss this later?
Oh, I'm not here for confrontation, Alan.
only some clarity.
will we be seeing each other again?
would tonight be soon enough?
Yes.
fine then.
the man Roland Huff shot.
wasn't that his sister?
I believe it was, yes.
you slept with her?
I did, actually.
thank you for asking.
do you mind?
sorry, I, uh, uh
thought they were firm flowers?
well, since they were out in the open, I thought - - I left them on my desk.
okay.
sorry.
you settled Melissa Kenner's case for twenty-five thousand dollars?
uh, oh, yeah.
she was very pleased.
hence the flowers.
how come you never told me about the settlement?
I mean, that's a pretty good result.
well, I-I don't know.
I don't talk about all my cases, Eugene.
Where's the money?
sorry?
our contingency?
there are no funds in the client's account.
so when is the money coming in?
soon.
very soon.
what's this?
the contingency on Melissa Kenner.
I can't make deposits as an associate, so I'm giving it to you as a partner.
I'm confused.
we deduct contingencies and then we pay the client.
why is this check -
I forgot.
the client got the whole thing.
she cut a money order for us.
you forgot?
you just gave the client the whole thing?
look, we got the money.
can you just make the deposit?
Hello!
Melissa! We were just talking about you.
I brought a little surprise.
did you get my flowers?
I did.
thank you so much.
well, I just thought -
mr Torrence!
what are you doing here?
Oh, well, uh, I work here.
you work here?
I don't understand.
Melissa... -You work for the airline?
the airline?
it's just in-house counsel for a big airline.
it just wasn't my calling.
and I was so overwhelmed by Jamie's dedication to you.
it so warmed the cockles of my heart.
I was inspired to shift career direction.
thank you, Melissa, for both the new life and the warm cockles.
I was trying to find my way back to find my way back to Storwood Drive, and I pulled over and asked for directions.
and suddenly, he just jumped in.
who jumped in?
him.
he told me he had a knife.
and told me to drive.
did you see the knife?
no.
okay.
then after he told you to drive, then what happened, Jessica?
he reached inside my purse, pulled out my wallet and my license.
he saw the Beacon Hill address.
he said he wanted some nice Beacon Hill things.
and he said if we didn't go there, he'd kill me.
so you drove to your home?
Yes.
he just wanted some stuff to sell to get drugs.
so I took him in.
he looked around and then, then he said first he wanted some recreation.
and that was the word he used.
recreation.
then, then he grabbed me.
I tried to scream but it -
take your time.
he pushed me to the floor and pulled off my jeans.
and I was just,
I was saying to myself, "Dear God."
please just let me pass out. "
did you pass out?
and then he was inside me.
he was inside me.
at any time, did you consent to having sex with the defendant?
no.
God, no.
thank you, Jessica.
allegation of rape,
that's a very serious thing.
when you accuse a man of rape, he could lose his freedom.
does counsel have a question?
did you willingly have sex with my client only to claim rape after your dad walked in?
no.
he forced me.
I see.
and have you ever claimed somebody raped you before after having -
Objection!
sustained. Cut it out, counsel.
isn't it true you invited my client back to your house?
no.
it is not true.
and I did not extend an invitation to be raped.
nothing further.
that went well.
Jimmy, it might be my imagination, but when you asked if she'd ever claimed rape before -
what?
well, it just seemed that the District Attorney was ready for the question.
he pounced to shut it down.
what are you saying?
you might have stumbled onto something.
I wasn't in on it. He just did it.
he pretended to be a representative of the airline?
Yes.
first, why didn't you stop him?
and second, why didn't you tell me or Eugene?
I didn't know he was going to do it, Ellenor.
and I didn't tell you to protect both him and you.
Jamie, you are a second-year associate.
it is not your call whether to tell or not on something like this.
the guy went to bat for me.
how can I - - I don't care.
you report to a superior, either me or Eugene.
no exceptions.
can you come into my office please?
have I been bad?
Oh, God, Jimmy.
here it is.
what?
page thirty-two.
victim's father reports two previous unconfirmed claims of rape.
Investigated...unsubstantiated. - ...unsubstantiated.
no arrests made.
how could we have missed this?
it's practically a scribbled footnote.
look.
it notes even the father doubted the validity of the prior claims.
she tells the father she was raped. Twice.
the claims are dismissed.
so she sets it up for him to walk in on her so he'd have to believe her.
you got fired from your last firm for embezzling.
allegedly.
you threatened extortion your first week here.
that was an accident.
break privilege, for which you almost got disbarred.
horseshoes.
sleep with witnesses.
just the one.
and now I find out you actually impersonated an opposing party so you could settle a case.
that's not just fraud.
that's probably criminal.
Alan, look at me.
you are seriously self-destructive.
isn't everybody?
look, I adore you, you know that.
but this firm is my life.
I have to tell Eugene.
may I ask why?
he's a fellow partner.
I have a fiduciary responsibility to him.
and you are exposing him to enormous liability, as you are Jimmy and me.
Alan, you are an amazing lawyer.
but I don't think it's going to work out here.
are you firing me?
I'm going to talk to Eugene.
but - I -
but you don't think it's going to work out here.
the difficult thing about firing him -
aside from him being your friend -
is that once again he fell on the sword for somebody else.
this time for the firm, as well as for Jamie.
and he did save us from a malpractice judgment.
and possibly exposed us to something much worse.
since I'm his friend I'm going to have to let you make the call here.
in the spirit of objectivity, I just can't bring myself to do it.
okay.
in the spirit of objectivity, you're going to have to deal with Jamie.
she's complicit, too.
all right, Mr. Berluti.
you may begin your defense.
thank you, Your Honor.
the defense re-calls Jessica Palmer.
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but if this involves a continuation of cross
this is something new.
well, I'd appreciate a proffer.
counsel, step up.
what is going on?
evidence has come to light that Ms. Palmer has made claims of rape before and -
this is rape shield. You can't get into this.
I Can't get into it?
none of us will get into here.
chambers.
her sexual past is off limits.
any questions relating to her sexual past are -
this goes to her credibility, not her sexual past.
this woman alleged rape how many times?
two.
both times to her father, who was dubious himself -
you can't say this.
I can't say it?
if she goes around claiming rape -
first of all, you can't prove these claims were false.
and even if you could, it still falls within rape shield.
false rape accusations by the victim are not admissible unless a four-prong test is satisfied.
one prong being, the victim is the only prosecution witness.
which here, she isn't.
we have an eyewitness to the rape.
her father.
it doesn't matter.
I'm not lookin" to impugn a woman's sexual past.
this is only being introduced to impeach -
I understand.
but there's no impeachment exception.
and even if there were, you have a slew of problems, counsel.
first, Mr. Webb states the law correctly.
your Honor -
second, victim's testimony has to be confused or inconsistent.
hers wasn't.
let me question her -
and third, you have to file all questions regarding her sexual past before trial.
you didn't.
because I didn't know.
and whose fault is that?
it was in the file.
did you read it?
they buried it deep in the file, barely a footnote, they didn't want us to find it.
but is was there.
your Honor, come on.
this woman has perhaps falsely claimed rape before.
how can it be possible that the jury doesn't get to hear this.
you can write your congressman if you don't like the law, counsel.
in here, we simply follow it.
any and all evidence of prior rape accusations will not be introduced.
you can't even raise it?
no.
how can this possibly be?
there are specific laws -
don't I have the right to confront my accuser?
unfortunately, not in rape cases.
look, I know this is unfair.
I don't know what to say.
so what happens next?
we put you up.
you tell your story.
as entitled as you are to anger, you can't let it overtake you in there. This is important.
anger is consistent with a rapist.
you need to keep it together.
I'm not firing you.
but if this were a big firm, or perhaps any firm other than this one, you would be fired.
you do know that.
what's happening to Alan?
it's Eugene's decision, so, he's likely gone.
did you hear what I just said?
I did.
well, do you have a responses?
I'm sure I do, but I'm distracted at the moment.
can I get back to you?
I have given you an opportunity, perhaps your last opportunity, to account for yourself.
you need to tell me your thinking now.
Eugene, trust me, if I shared my thoughts with you, you'd regard them as disrespectful, rather than a product of my preoccupation, which I assure you is all it is.
talk.
okay.
I went to bed with a lovely woman the other night.
she had an extremely fetching body which, believe it or not, I wasn't aware of prior to the lovemaking.
the reason for that is, she dresses to desexualize herself.
and that led me to believe that perhaps there's some dark backstory I'm not privy to.
I do know she seems sad.
and then it got me to thinking, most of my relationships have been with sad women.
and I was wondering why, what does that say about me?
in the end, it always comes back to me.
comments?
she picked you up?
Yes.
I was on my way home from work.
what do you do, sir?
I'm a foreman at a furniture warehouse.
I was on my way home, walking down Tremont and she pulled over to ask me for directions.
Jessica Palmer?
Yes.
and then she started talkin" me up.
then, she asked me if I wanted to climb in, go for a drive.
she invited you into her car?
I know.
it struck me as strange, too.
Plus, she seemed shy, so what she was sayin" wasn't exactly in keepin" with her scared-like personality, but that's what happened.
okay. So, you got in?
Yes.
then she started talkin" about it was her twenty-first birthday and tellin" me how she had lived a sheltered life, how she hadn't lived, how she hadn't done wild things and stuff like that.
and the next thing, she's inviting me back to her place.
just like that?
just like that.
it's the truth.
and you said yes?
attractive women don't pull over every day and invite me home.
so what happened after you got to her place?
we went inside.
she was very forword, sexually.
she said it was like some kind of fantasy of hers.
she wanted to pick up some guy in her car and take him home and make love to him.
and I made some crack like, "yeah, it's my fantasy too. "
I mean, she didn't even want to go to her bedroom.
she wanted to make love right there on the floor.
be wild.
Mr. Mills, this sounds like a very aggressive woman.
I know.
and she had that same shy demeanor as she had in this witness chair.
it didn't make sense, but that's what she said.
she wanted to have sex, and we did.
and in the middle, her father comes in and hits me with a shovel.
and that's what happened.
as God is my witness, that's what happened.
problem is, we have another witness and he saw you committing a rape.
we were making love.
which she consented to.
this woman picks up a total stranger, drives him to her home in Beacon Hill and asks him to make love to her?
Yes.
you wouldn't go into somebody's house uninvited, would you Mr. Mills?
ever been convicted of a crime, sir?
ten years ago.
breaking and entering?
that's not who I am today.
one assault.
I was a kid back then.
I'm a thirty-year-old man now.
I made a life for myself.
why didn't you wear a condom?
I didn't have one.
neither did she.
gee, that seems odd.
this woman solicits a total stranger for sex and she's not going to have a condom?
that's a death wish, isn't it Mr. Mills?
well, maybe she's got a death wish.
maybe she had some disease where she needs to fake it -
move to strike!
Mr. Mills!
well, why can't I say it?
Mr. Mills, I will direct you to answer the District Attorney's question.
he asked me if she had a death wish. It goes to her disease.
Mr. Mills, I sincerely don't want to prejudice your case.
members of the jury there is no evidence before you concerning the victim having a disease.
you are to disregard such rants from the defendant -
Objection!
he's not ranting, Your Honor, and -
Mr. Berluti, we can stop this proceeding right now and complicate everybody's lives.
there are rules of evidence.
we will all play by those rules.
Mr. Webb?
I'm done, Your Honor.
very wise decision.
Hey.
Hey.
did you fire him?
don't ask me why, but no.
maybe you like him.
I do not like that man, it had nothing to do with that.
you fire Jamie?
no.
how you doing, Eugene?
me? Fine.
okay.
what are you doing here?
I just came in for a drink.
I didn't know you'd be here.
I'm here every night and you know it.
you had discretion to let that stuff in -
get lost, or I'll hold you in contempt.
I'll risk contempt.
that woman cries wolf with rape.
she set the whole thing up for her father to walk in on.
prove it in court, Jimmy.
my client is innocent.
you know it.
that's probably why you're in here getting drunk.
wrong again. I get drunk every night.
I know you, Roberta.
I know your heart and I know your sense of fairness.
this is something you can fix.
Jimmy, you are a lawyer appearing before me in a trial.
this is ex parte.
after this case is over, if you want to sit next to me, fine.
we can share a drink.
who knows, I might even wet your whistle after.
but for now, get your ass off that stool.
you're a vulgar, desperate woman.
all the more reason to remain a good judge, then.
now beat it.
you heard the victim.
you heard from an eyewitness who saw the rape in progress.
the defendant says it was consensual.
consensual sex does not look like rape, ladies and gentlemen.
and consider the logic of what the defendant is asking you to believe.
that Jessica Palmer picked up a strange man - a felon - in a terrible section of town, brought him back to her place to have unprotected sex, all the while knowing her father would either be there or be there shortly.
that really sounds credible, doesn't it?
and what would be her motive for making this up?
because rape trials are fun?
the eyewitness was her father, who basically admitted he went into shock as soon as he entered the room.
can we completely trust his version of what he thinks he saw?
no.
this case comes down to Jessica Palmer's word against Derrick Mills."
might you be more inclined to believe her?
sure.
okay.
but can we know she's telling the truth beyond all reasonable doubt.
and you want to talk about logic?
my client's prints were all over the car, all over the house.
he's got a record.
his prints are on file with the police.
he's going to rape somebody and leave that kind of evidence behind?
he's going to leave his semen there for easy DNA identification?
does that make sense to you?
something's going on here, folks.
the D. A. asks what would be her motive to lie?
we can't know.
we have rape shield laws that prohibit us from getting into her story.
but let me ask you this.
does it feel like you've got the whole story?
does it?
are you not going to work today?
I am, I just thought I might hover a bit this morning.
what are you thinking?
why does everybody so readily ask that question today?
it's as common as "How's the weather?"
it's cheating.
people should be required to figure it out.
has a man ever asked you to disrobe?
I don't mean go to bed,
I mean simply asked you to disrobe from across the room so he might look at you?
no.
would you like to be asked that?
I don't know.
like I said, I've never been asked.
would you like to be asked?
Yes.
interesting.
if you think I'm asking only because you want me to,
I assure you I'm being genuine.
would you take off your robe?
how long have they been out?
almost five hours, which I guess it's good.
it means they at least gotta be asking questions.
Yeah.
can I talk to you for a second?
it was in the file that she had claimed rape before?
so if you had filed your questions with the court as required, you probably would have been able to cross examine the victim on it.
you don't need to tell me.
okey.
you and I both know the idea that every defendant is entitled to an adequate defense is a lie.
defense lawyers, many times, barely bother to meet the client or read the file.
some even doze during trials.
lawyers phone it in all the time.
but for it to happen here, for a lawyer in this firm to be as blatantly unprepared, court-appointed or not...
if we lose,
I'll prepare the inadequate defense appeal myself.
yeah?
okay.
your jury's back.
will the defendant please rise?
members of the jury have you reached a verdict?
we have, Your Honor.
what say you?
commonwealth versus Derrick Mills, on the charge of forcible rape, we find the defendant, Derrick Mills, guilty.
this concludes your service.
the court thanks you.
security will take the defendant into custody.
we are adjourned.
derrick, look at me.
I will get you out.
whatever I have to do.
I will get you out.
where is Jimmy now?
he went home.
he's pretty devastated.
call him. He needs to get to work on the appeal.
Eugene, I should have caught this, too.
Yes, you should have.
but you're a third-year law student.
he's not.
you're not going to ask me my thoughts, are you?
Ellenor said something about me being self-destructive.
it was probably just conversation filler, I really don't know.
but I assure you if I am, unwittingly or unconsciously trying to take anybody down, it isn't you.
or this law firm.
you're on my stool.
I'm sorry.
your ruling was correct.
and any - this was my doing.
I just came to say that.
now that the case is over, I was wondering if your offer's still good.
I mean, to have a drink together.
the case isn't over.
there's still sentencing.
but I suppose there's nothing wrong in drinking separately on adjacent stools, enjoying the illusion of company, I guess.
I could use it.
so could I.
you're late. And you look like shit.
I know both of those things already.
Margaret Thatcher used to survive on less than four hours' sleep a night.
how is that possible? Monkey glands.
she was mad. Mad people have different needs.
and she lived above the shop so she didn't have to commute.
God, I mean, London is so big.
can't we devolve some of it?
if I could get one decent night's shut-eye...
well, do yourself a favour and stay in the flat.
I can't break my promise to Kate.
do you actually get to see the children?
Glenn, I don't have time for that. All I do...
I work, I eat, I shower... that's it.
and occasionally...
I take a dump, just as a sort of treat.
I mean, that really is my treat.
that's what it's come to. That's...
I sit there and I think...
no, I'm not gonna read the New Statesman.
this time is just for me.
this is quality time just for me.
is that normal? It's sad.
at least I've made something.
morning, Secretary of State.
we've got quite a lot to get through.
I've cancelled that interview for BBC Norfolk.
Why?
well, it was gonna clash with the two minutes' silence.
good call If you're not remembering the dead and talking about benefit fraud in Kings Lynn you are gonna look a bit of a dick.
Olly, could you get me another coffee?
remember what I told you?
when I was working at Waitrose?
Yes. I know. Do you remember that?
it was two minutes' silence, ordinary Sunday, and somebody went on the Tannoy about a spillage alert.
the tabloids were like rats up a drainpipe.
were they?
can you just...? It's the Times.
could you just have a quick look at that?
is it about me? Have a read of it first.
I find this job exciting enough without injecting artificial suspense.
you're cock-teasing, Terri, tell me what it is.
Hello, Malcolm.
no, he hasn't yet. No What?
he is, isn't he? He's a prick Who's a prick?
am I a prick? Yep, rip the ball sack off.
whose ball sack? Whose ball sack?
whose balls?
Hello, Malcolm.
have you seen Simon Hewitt's piece?
I haven't quite been through it, er, yet.
have you got to the bit where he calls you out of your depth?
no, at the moment he's calling me...
the political equivalent of the house wine at a suburban Indian restaurant."
that's not very good, is it? Hang on a second.
Ooh, "insipid," yeah.
uninspiring.
Christ, that's bad, look at that.
Ooh, "disconnected to the point of autism."
we're gonna get this tosser, Hugh, don't you worry.
he'll be at the Sport, Photoshopping the tits of Hollyoaks extras by the end of the month.
can I just... Hello? No, he's gone.
that's great. Malcolm's backing me.
yeah? So, how do we respond to this?
right, we don't exchange insults with bloody Simon arsepipes titty-twat.
is that honestly the best swearing you can come up with?
this is a bucket of shit. If someone throws shit, we throw shit at them. We start a shit fight.
we throw so much shit back at them that they can't pick up shit, throw shit, or do shit.
that's top swearing, Glenn, well done
watch and learn We're all agreed that the department needs to look a bit less...
autistic. -. badly staffed.
so we need to, at this morning's policy review, come up with some sort of new announcement that's a bit more connected, bit more... funky!
funky. Look, erm...
I hope you're not gonna just toss off some policy just to get back at some journalist.
so, erm, essentially this is just us again but in a bigger room, isn't it?
and without Terri.
Yeah, I've block-booked 14 meeting rooms.
she'll never find us It's foolproof.
it's the only way to get any work done.
Chris from Health does it all the time.
OK, all right, I'll start. There was a key worker policy
I worked up a couple of months ago.
quite like that. We need to find an angle
a very good angle.
youths. You know? People are afraid of youths.
I mean, I know I am.
you taking the piss? No. I'm just joshing.
it sounds as though you're taking the piss.
it's just good-natured joshing.
will the two of you just shut up?
I am being good-natured.
shut up for a minute, please. Where else can we go?
pollution, the environment.
litter, dog shit.
aiming high.
we aimed high, now we're at dog shit.
so what you're looking for...
this is what we're doing.
I'm putting it about. Morning, Malcolm.
. that Hewitt's piece was a packet of bollocks, a favour to Cliff.
Cliffbeing...? Cliff Lawton.
Hugh's predecessor. He and Hewitt are tight as arse cheeks.
are they now?
fuck knows, but that's what we're saying.
it's personal, it's back-slapping, it's borderline homoerotic, and you are the innocent victim of a nasty media stitch-up.
OK, right I'm fixing you up with a "me and my media" piece with your ex Angela Heaney.
but it is a perfect opportunity to show just how clued up you are, actually.
Hughy Abbot, the in-touch guy.
you're on the ball, you know the price of a pint of milk, you love HBO imports, VH1, Pixar, you dig the Streets...
Yeah, no, they're all great.
you've got absolutely no fucking idea what I'm talking about, do you?
Yeah, yeah, I do.
who's the only gay in the village?
Eddie Grundy.
I-I don't know.
no, he's got children. Mind you, a lot of them do, these days. Ben at the Foreign Office...
what's a chav? Ch... Erm...
it's... erm. You must know this, Hugh
Hugh, what is a chav?
chav.
chav. Chav Just saying "chav" isn't very helpful.
this is important stuff, Hugh. Right.
we do a weekly digest for the Prime Minister.
we boil down the week's television, cinema, music, so on...
the Zeitgeist tapes Exactly. Zeitgeist tape.
Eastenders highlights, choice bits from the reality shows, ten-second music videos.
God, that's why the PM always looks so clued up.
I always though he was genuinely quite with it.
no, he uses phrases like "with it" as well.
I'm gonna bike that over to Terri. Watch it, OK?
and when you talk to Angela Heaney, remember to stick the boot into Hewitt.
I'm putting it about that Cliff offered him two weeks at his Tuscan villa for that piece.
Ten-four, daddy -o
Hey, hey, hey, hey, this is serious.
you have got 24 hours to sort out your policy on EastEnders, right?
or you're for the halal butchers.
even he knows.
Terri.
two main contenders for our policy decision Right.
er, we change arts and music policy funding so that we give most of the money to the bad kids, give them intensive arts and music tuition, stop them turning into tomorrow's crims and offenders.
perhaps you'd like to outline your...?
I'm for we punish disruptive kids by cutting them out of extra music and arts tuition.
show them the carrot and the stick early on.
the bad kids, they get no money.
and, Olly, the same bad kids, they get...
more money.
more money They could both play.
they're fundamentally contradictory.
so which one should we go with?
why don't you go with both of them or neither of them or a different policy?
you're being quite flippant.
do you have a preference? That's not my role.
I sell the apples.
if you want me to sell apples, I will.
if you want me to sell oranges, I'll go and tell people that the apples are shit, Olly. They're shit.
I'll say, "Go on, check out our oranges.
which do you prefer? Apples or oranges.
apples Apples.
apples OK. Thank you.
apples If we spend taxpayers' money putting thugs into productions of the fucking Cherry Orchard we're gonna get crucified, and rightly so.
hang on a second. Terri, which was apples?
was Olly apples or was Glenn apples?
she's... she's gone.
let's throw this to a focus group.
Yeah. Yeah, whatever.
this is where you've been having secret meetings, is it?
Yeah. No No. Yeah.
well? I cannot keep abreast of all this.
can't you precis some of it for me? Yeah, sure.
I'll take a precis of the transcripts and a precis of the press packs.
could you precis this for me, the Zeitgeist tape?
check this out.
this is a tape of this morning's focus group.
this is Mary, she is a focus group legend.
Mary Mary she's called.
everything that she's said in the last 12 months in every focus group has chimed exactly with the core voter.
and she loved my arts for hearts and minds policy.
arts for hearts and minds?
that's what we're calling it.
and she said, Glenn, that it chimed brilliantly with stay -at-home mums like her.
and she's really core Middle England, is she?
totally, totally core Middle England.
if children are put in a position where they've got responsibility,
I think they'll rise to that challenge.
art is all about expression, isn't it?
can we get her in for a one-to-one?
Yeah. Absolutely
what, we're gonna precis the focus group?
yeah We'll just make it a bit more... focused.
everybody else basically agrees with what she says.
she's got everything.
very good way to work. I like this.
cut out all the extraneous stuff, you know. Just the facts, man.
just the protein. Atkins government.
OK, I'll get her in.
in fact here they are now.
Hello! Hi. I'm Mary.
this is Hugh Abbott, this is Mary.
and, Mary, this is Glenn Cullen.
and this is Mary, our focus group star.
great to meet you.
thank you. I keep getting asked back.
well, you are one of the most articulate of our focus groupees.
that's... Yeah... Not groupie, groupees with two Es.
yes You're very kind, thanks.
all right, listen, just to push on...
I was thinking that if I am representative of the public at large you're gonna listen to what I say...
you're every woman.
it's all in me. " Something like that.
it's, er, it's a song, Hugh Yeah, I know.
so, Mary, the policy we were talking about...
great policy.
thank you Yeah, really good, well done.
we were wondering.
I was thinking about it aftereards.
and if those extra classes, you know, the drama and the music and the art classes, if they have them after school it saves the potentially naughty children from missing out on the core curriculum.
that's important That's a good angle.
and also it would be, I think, a really welcome breathing space for some of the single parents, like me.
yes Excellent.
I thought of a name for it.
I thought you could call it Play For Tomorrow.
play For Tomorrow. Yeah, excellent.
thank you so much for coming in, and good luck with the single mother thing.
thank you I'll be right... Erm...
I'll see you in a bit, Glenn.
and you're against it? It'll die on its arse.
my Grandma was mugged by some ferret-faced teenager with a neck tattoo.
what are you gonna do about it? Teach him the bassoon.
it is, as my dear old mother would have said, double wank and shit chips.
but you think it's got legs, Hugh?
several How did it play with the focus groups?
she loves it Sorry?
they absolutely love it.
you've got 94% approve strongly approve rating.
why did you say "she"? I don't know.
you can call boats she.
94%. It's all there, black and white.
it's difficult to argue with that, Glenn, whatever your foul-mouthed mother might have said.
Yes, I can feel a stiffy in the post.
my guts still say no.
substantial as they are, they're outvoted.
I'll talk to Tom about green-lighting this.
so that's a go, Terri.
just, erm, put the smell out, see if anybody... gags on it.
just... just float it.
OK, er. Problem?
can we please try and...
stop making policy on the hoof?
we've been on the hoof and we have been too hoofy.
have we? If there could just be some sitting down.
yeah Just, you know, sitting down.
that's all I'm saying Yeah.
we've got the chairs, we should use them.
I think so. That was it
OK. Is that it?
that's the problem. No more.
problem solved. Good point.
I'll go and float OK.
face up? If you like, yep.
see you, Terri.
Malcolm, I know you were keen on
Terri's appointment but...
she's shit I wouldn't go that far.
she's a box-ticker, Hugh.
she can't think outside the box.
she's built a box inside the actual box and she's doing her thinking inside that box.
exactly. I like that Sorry, I'm so tired.
no, that's good.
I have so much stuff to read and think about.
you seem to get through it all right.
Yeah, I find the time, somewhere.
do you get lonely?
no No. Neither do I.
so did you watch the Zeitgeist tape?
some of it, yeah.
so you know your EastEnders? Little Mo, Big Mo?
what?
I havn't watch it. What the fuck are you playing at?
are you playing at being a minister or are you a real-life fucking minister?
I am a real-life minister.
I've never seen headlines like it In what way?
it's all gone to shite.
Oh, the papers didn't like the policy?
they fucking loathe it. Are you getting all this, Hugh?
Yes, you're very clear.
do they all hate it? The Times?
especially the Times.
haven't gone to bed yet.
how do you know? Because I'm connected.
I'm plugged into the matrix. I am the fucking matrix.
what... what... Sorry?
have you not watched that tape?
I'm taking it home now to watch it there.
we've just bought a new video player off the back of Alicia's obsession with Pingu.
OK, pay attention I've heard of Pingu.
this arts policy is dead, OK? As of now.
get a press release together and bung it in the oven.
fuck off, the lot of you.
and, Hugh, watch that tape.
I was in the Blackeall Tunnel, can you repeat all that?
these focus groups, they're absolutely useless.
Oh, it's useless to ask people what they think, is it?
before we formulate policy?
look, there's not point ask people what they think people either don't know what they think or they think you should bring back hanging for traffic wardens.
or they just think what every person would think.
I'm Geoff Average, I think the same as everybody else cos I'm a normal bloke and everybody thinks like me
I work in IT, every weekend I pop pills and do DJing, spare cash cos I'm a single mum, and I'm in the National Trust,
I enjoy sports on TV, anything with Colin Firth.
I enjoy domestic violence and sun-dried fucking... karaoke.
not everybody is the same, Glenn.
people can surprise you.
was that good-natured joshing?
Tucker Malcolm, er... hope I didn't wake you up.
Hewitt.
Yeah, I'm doing a piece this Sunday, a big piece on focus groups, it's sort of inspired by your latest policy disaster.
I'm gonna be concentrating on how your man Abbot can't do a single thing without focus groups.
I'm shaking with fear.
Yeah, well, that's sexual jealousy
you're so witty.
pity none of it makes it into your columns.
listen, I'd love to spend the evening listening to you but I've got better things to do.
fuck off back to your match reports, you twat.
hello.
Hugh, it's Terri Yeah, hello.
sorry, I've woken you up I wasn't asleep.
I just got dropped off and I'm being picked up again in three hours so I kept my trousers on.
listen, I've just heard that Simon Hewitt's doing another piece on you about how you rely on focus groups.
Oh, cock Look, I'll be on it in the morning so don't lose any sleep over it
are you taking the piss?
erm, no Sorry,
I've got to go. I've got an egg on.
see you in the morning.
bye-bye Night, Hugh. Bye.
bitch.
how fucked am I?
well, you look awful. You quite often look bad, but...
in terms of negative publicity.
on the fuckometer, where am I?
Oh, 1 2 Yeah.
1 2, say Out of what?
er... 50 Oh.
mine was out of ten.
right, so I'm... 24%%ucked according to you but according to you I'm 1 20%% fucked.
erm, yeah. I didn't...
Terri, have you got anything?
I can't ask them to drop the piece, it would make us look pathetic.
I don't mean to come across all Mr Gradgrind but this is your job, sorting out the press.
this is Malcolm's problem, anyway, it's him that spun that...
all right, this is what we're gonna do.
I'm bringing foreard Hugh's interview with Heaney to this afternoon.
morning, Malcolm It goes out tomorrow morning.
that way we can get our side of the story across and piss all over Simon Hewitt's cornflakes, sadly only metaphorically. Yeah?
right, OK. Olly, call Heaney. Terri, get on to her editor.
Glenn, book her room.
Bodie, Doyle, you go round the back.
at times of stress, I make jokes!
right. Erm...
what do I do?
sit down at the TV with me.
you're gonna watch that Zeitgeist tape now.
you don't seem to be able to understand...
shit I know, but people watch it.
this gets six million Oh, shit.
what?
she's an actress Who?
Mary from the focus group, she's an actress.
Oh, relax, that doesn't matter.
if focus groups are short of numbers they bung in a couple of actors.
it doesn't matter because it's a focus group
I need to think. I'll call you.
Ooh, I've just remembered. Erm...
can you just. I'll pause it.
if you could pause it for a second,
I'll be... I'll be back in a sec.
Glenn, got a bit of a problem What?
you remember Mary from the focus group?
what, Miss Immaculate bloody Conception?
she's an actress What do you mean?
I mean that she's... There's no clearer way of saying it she's an actress.
are you sure? I've just seen her in The Bill.
Oh, Jesus.
this doesn't have to be a total disaster.
it does. It means she's not really a stay-at-home Middle England housewife, she's just playing a part.
so, what she said wasn't, you know...
Yes, I do know.
what? Who said what? What?
we are organising focus groups to listen to the opinions of ordinary people, except they're not ordinary people, they're fucking actors, so they're not technically people at all
can I get back to you?
your fucking legend is a fucking actress.
focus group companies do it all the time.
if they can't cobble together the right cross-section, they call a casting agency.
dial an opinion, is it?
send me three liberals, two mavericks and a racist. Brilliant!
we've based the whole thing on her. Just her!
her alone! Don't you see?
why didn't you run it past me?
shit. Shit.
it's not real. I thought I recognised her.
she was in Midsomer Murders.
why didn't you say anything?
I thought she might've had a twin.
what a stupid thing to...
fuck! Fuck!
you said "she." Yes.
come out of the cupboard, Hugh No.
Hugh, we have to sort this out.
when I asked you about the focus group. Yeah.
. you said "she" loved it.
we gave her a one-on-one.
Why?
she's Middle England.
so, Middle England is a big fucking field with one woman standing in it?
do you think Hewitt will find out?
of course he fucking will, she's his mole!
that's why he's got a piece in the paper tomorrow.
we've got to shut this down now, right?
I want this leaked to Angela Heaney.
it's damage control, OK?
we put out the story the way we want it before Hewitt fucks us up the bugle.
get onto it, now Yeah... It was Olly's, erm...
it's not my fault It was Olly's idea.
I went with it The agency lied to us, Hugh.
the agency lied to me I fought for going with it.
we should get her in Get on to Heaney's editor.
I'm on to it, Malcolm.
talk to Angela, get her to do this.
right, OK Can I speak to Angela Heaney?
can I leave a message?
Malcolm, may I just suggest...
exactly.
we've been lied to, abused.
we are the victims of abuse Olly.
shut up Can you call her?
you are a broken vase.
how do I know she's an actress? I never watch television.
that's why you gave me the stupid tape.
we're gonna get her in, talk to her, she'll meet us, we'll...
I will talk to her because I'm good with people.
she can help us, she'll see our point of view, we'll be fine.
I hope so, I hope that's what happens.
or we kill her It will...
make him look presentable. I've got a big story.
comb his hair, change his tie and his shirt
no, it's fine, don't worry about it.
you're looking evening television,
I want you to look afternoon.
what do you want me to wear, a fucking Hawaiian shirt?
shall we see if you've got one?
no, she can't have a car.
just don't fucking mother me, OK?
I... it's... I'm not so much mothering, it's just... wanting to help.
are we getting her... Mary... Can we get her in tonight?
won't that look a bit odd?
does anyone have her number?
I've got a number for the agency.
get on to the agency.
it's all right. It's not, actually.
Mary, you know Hugh. You've met Glenn before.
this is Malcolm Tucker, he's our director of communications.
take a seat, Mary Thanks.
we are so grateful for you coming in at this ungodly hour.
is there... a problem?
Yeah, there is. you flapping your trap!
the issues is... the issue of your being an actress.
right.
I actually prefer actor
I'm sorry. Sexist, sorry.
slightly, yeah Essentially, you know, what you told us was fundamentally honest, the truth, it was honestly... genuinely what you thought
Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah.
I haven't got two children, but apart from that it was essentially...
most... Yes, of course. You invented the kids?
I... Yeah, I was. You made up small children?
I know small children That's sick.
Jesus Christ I was just being representative.
you invented children.
small children that don't exist.
I was giving you what you wanted.
so, eventually you lose track, the lies compound themselves and you end up all over the place like a crazy woman's shit.
and that's the problem that we're now trying to deal with.
we've given this story to a tame journalist, one who's more likely to be sympathetic...
do you just want to think about what is going to happen tomorrow?
you are gonna find the press all over you...
in a good way? No, not at all.
you know that film Notting Hill?
she's probably fucking in it.
you know that bit where he opens the door and there's millions of journalists and photographers and all flashbulbs are going off?
in about four hours, that's gonna be you.
they're gonna be all over you like fucking cockroaches.
it's OK No, no, no, no, no, it's not OK.
it's not gonna be OK, and I'll tell you why.
because you're fair game.
so I hope your knickers are clean.
because every seat-sniffing little shitbag that's ever filed a by-line is gonna be questioning you.
cos now it's in the fucking public interest, isn't it?
and they're gonna hit you with any shit they can find and you're gonna be spread out there in front of them like a trollop in the stocks!
we-we've done...
I still don't understand what's going on.
we can hold those dogs back.
what do you mean?
we can get you a nice journalist Yes, exactly.
we can get you to a nice, young journalist, Angela Heaney, and maybe you... I don't know what he made you sign, but whatever it was, it was bullshit.
maybe if you just say that you were misquoted and also that Simon Hewitt's a prick.
if you just said that. Who?
the journalist that you told your story to
I... I didn't... I didn't talk to any journalist.
no, no, no You spoke to Simon Hewitt.
no, I...
you fucking spoke to Simon Hewitt, he's a fat guy with a tiny dick the size of a bookie's biro.
you fucking spoke to him I'd like to go now.
you didn't speak to him.
she didn't fucking speak to him.
I don't know anyone called... Simon...
whatever the fuck Hewitt.
Hewitt, yeah
she doesn't even know.
fuck's sake. What's the matter with him?
Olly. Sorry if I upset you.
sorry, darling, sorry.
crossed lines, darling. Sorry about that.
will you leave me alone?
if you need a car, I'll get whatever you need.
for fuck's sake!
she didn't even know Fuck him!
that didn't really work, did it?
is it too late...
can I get this straight for my own sanity?
if we get on the phone, can we pull the front page?
no. It's too late.
Heaney's piece is gonna go ahead anyway?
of course it fucking is. I'm good but I can't fucking hold back the tide, can I?
all right, that's it. I'm going to bed.
kind of ironic, really. You're fucking on your own!
. because she hasn't actually spoken to Hewitt, er... and we've...
of our own volition, voluntarily...
released the story to the press...
unnecessarily.
damn
who was that evil Scottish guy?
he's the director of communications.
he was ordering me what to say to the papers.
dragging me out of bed and telling me...
I think some papers might be interested in that.
no, look... The department has a lot of initiatives coming up...
right. Right. Has it really? Yeah.
and we're going to need the face of urban renewal for the... thing, a whole campaign, there's gonna be stationery, pens...
face probably won't fit on...
we've got all that coming up. You are trying to bribe me with a stationery photo shoot?
er, no, erm...
none of this is happening. No, not bribe, no.
that was just small talk. You understandthat, right? I was just chatting. Small chat.
can you wake me in a couple of hours?
there's no time to go home,
I'll pass myself coming back in.
I'll ring Catherine and say you won't be home.
how did you get on?
happiness?
go away, Terri.
I'll clear up a few biscuits whilst I'm at it.
Kate, just leaving a message for you
I know you're asleep by now
from Hugh. Love to the kids, see Alicia in the morning and, erm... big kiss and sorry about the bedtime story.
dear Attilio, we are all gathered here together...
who's the half-wit who left his car outside?
that's mine. -- Well you can't leave it there! -- Ten Minutes! -- Too long.
five! -- No more than five.
in five minutes I'm going to clamp you!
gang of loonies, here every bloody night...
this woman has something to say to you.
Attilio De Giovanni,
I sing your name, it opens the gates of Paradise.
you will be mine forever, so grant me gods.
when you kiss me, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse gallop forth and when I think of your body, so troubled and vague, the ground opens beneath my feet.
your divine manhood ascends to heaven, you're beautiful!
you sunflower crazed by light, when you raise your eyes you set the sky ablaze.
friends, see how the earth, like a mother, gives suck to her most precious child.
Oh my beloved, all creation overflows with passion, and like a golden comet in the sky, from my mouth burst forth this cry.
I love you.
I want to make love to you now.
that's the best line I ever heard in my life.
how about that?
camels may be smelly, but they're smart.
what's that? -- A bat!
get down, keep down!
it's casing the joint, let's see what it's up to!
let's get under the bed.
go away, beastly bat!
don't say that.
you'll offend it if you call it a beastly bar, you've got to be nice.
Oh bat, sweet creature of the night, you'll find the window on your right!
what luck!
that's what poetry's all about, you called it a beastly bat...
it always works.
I was shaving in the bathroom yesterday.
a spider climbed in and I said to it, "Spider dear, get out of here."
it went! -- And if you find a mouse?
"Mr. Mouse, leave this house" then run for it.
will you teach me to write nice poems?
how did you become a poet?
how do you start?
I was small, younger than you are now, eight or nine.
I was with my mother, I loved her so much...
we were at Uncle Giustino's and there was a wood.
do you know what happened? - What?
a little bird flew by, singing, flying lower and lower.
he landed right here on my shoulder.
I swear!
he'd chosen me, of all people.
I was afraid he'd fly away, so I pretended to be a tree,
I didn't move a muscle.
I started to feel my heart beating, thumping actually.
and then? -- It flew away.
I wanted to tell my mother.
mamma, a little bird, flying and singing...
landed on my shoulder and sat there for an hour.
she said, "I thought something awful happened" and carried on chatting.
that was mean of Granny, didn't she like birds?
no, Granny wasn't mean, and she did like little birds.
it wasn't her, it was me.
it was my fault for not telling the story properly, for not making her feel what I'd felt.
I was so upset I told myself, "There must be people whose job it is to use the right words, put things in a way who when their hearts beats, can get other people's hearts to beat.
that day I decided to become a poet.
my heart beat. -- Mine too, but Granny's didn't.
if the words aren't right, nothing's right.
if I say now, "go to sleep," those are the right words.
and if another bat comes in? - Off to bed with you.
I've got to get you to school at 9: 00 tomorrow.
at 8: 30!
I know.
Oh my beloved, all creation overflows with passions, and like a golden comet in the sky, from my mouth bursts forth this cry,
I love you!
my love, I want to stay with you here forever, for all eternity.
don't you have to take the girls to school at 8: 30?
give me five minutes, be right back.
you don't remember where I left the car, do you?
same bloody car parked outside... -- It's mine, I'll move it.
five minutes.
come along, don't hang around, take your time.
don't start writing love poems, they're the hardest, wait till you're at least 80.
write about something else, the sea, the wind, a radiator, a tram running late, no one thing's more poetic than another.
poetry isn't without, it's within.
don't ask what's poetic or true, look in the mirror, poetry's you.
dress your poems up, choose your words carefully, be selective, some things you need eight months to find one word.
beauty started when people began to choose, since Adam and Eve.
you know how long Eve took to pick the right fig leaf?
how about this one? She stripped bare all the fig trees in Paradise.
fall in love, if you don't love it's all dead!
fall in love and everything will come to life.
squander yourjoy, dissipate your cheerfulness.
be sad and silent with enthusiasm, hurl your happiness into people's faces.
and how? Let me look at my notes, I've forgotten.
that's what you should do.
I can't read them.
to convey happiness you must be happy, to convey pain you must to happy.
be happy, you must suffer! Don't be scared of suffering, the whole world suffers!
if you don't have the means, don't worry, only one thing is necessary to write poetry, everything.
don't try to be modern, it's the most old-fashioned thing there is.
if a line doesn't come to you in this position, chuck yourself on the ground like this!
it's lying down that you see the sky.
why didn't I do that before?
what are you looking at? Poets don't look, they see.
make words obey you.
if the world "wall" doesn't take any notice, don't use it again for eight years, that'll teach it.
what's that? No idea!
that's true beauty, like those lines there, that I want left there forever.
erase it all, we've got to start, the lesson's over.
see you Wednesday... Thursday.
goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.
the room's all yours, Professor Browning.
thank you Signor De Giovanni.
please don't, I'll do it.
still having problems with the principal?
lots, about the course, I'd like to discuss it with you.
can we sleep together tonight?
Nancy!
last time we slept together it snowed, it was the coldest most beautiful day in January.
lets sleep together. -- The kids'll be back.
it's laying down that you see the sky.
don't you like me anymore?
I had such a wonderful time with you, why did you want to cut it so short?
when I fell in love with you...
I fell in love with you because you fell in love with me.
and a wonderful fall it was.
what are you doing this evening?
nothing. -- Let's sleep together tonight.
Attilio, we've gotta go.
hi Ermanno.
do you remember where I left the car?
near the entrance. -- Thank you, Nancy.
knock-knock, I look through the peep-hole, all I see is hair.
I open the door and a bear says, "Hello Ermanno, give me a kiss."
I ask, "Who are you?"
and she, "Don't you recognize me, my son?"
No!
and she starts crying.
I say, "I'm sorry, Mamma," and put my arms around her, then this morning when I woke up I felt so happy.
your mother was a bear? -- I'd just never realized it before.
I kept dreaming about vultures, hyenas, crocodiles...
good for you.
I always have the same dream.
the same animal?
no, no animal at all.
I'm at a kind of wedding with lots of people, and then in she walks, the woman I'm crazy about.
she ends up telling me, "I want to make love with you, kiss me."
so what do you do?
I pass out.
it's wonderful. -- What kind of animal is she?
it's her, the love of my life.
what kind of a dream is that?
it's like saying I like cherries and in my dream I eat cherries.
it denotes a primitive subconscious.
a Dream that won't come true? -- Come true!
if I like a woman, I dream about her in a symbolic fashion, she's a penguin bearing the mythological baggage of penguins, or she's a iguana, that's a mature dream.
you think? -- What, me? Sigmund Freud thinks so.
Freud.
dream about an animal?
right on time, just starting.
love thou thy dream, all base love scorning.
love thou the wind, and here take warning.
that dreams alone can truly be. For this dream I come to thee.
he's the greatest living Arab poet. Beautiful that poem, eh?
rips you apart. -- Sure does.
you'll hear the rest.
fuad concluded with a homage to one of his inspirational mentors.
Fuad, in these difficult days for his home country, decided to leave France and go back to Baghdad.
let's hope this senseless war never breaks out.
let's thank Fuad, goodbye to all.
damn, I think it's over!
shall we go eat? -- I want to go and say hello to him.
Fuad, remember that name.
in four, five years' time, he'll get the Nobel Prize.
it'll be a wrench to leave Paris after 18 years...
when will you go back to Baghdad? -- As soon as possible.
how much time do you need to finish the book?
the publishers want it in September, but I refuse to rush.
I'd like to spend at least a week with you.
we'll find the time.
goodbye, see you soon.
Attilio!
Fuad! -- Where were you?
back there, I got here a bit late but I enjoyed the whole thing.
you've got fans here, when I quoted you at the start they all cheered, did you hear it?
Vittoria!
your book.
Oh, thank you.
I'm losing my mind.
do you have time for dinner? -- Let's have dinner together.
then I'll leave you to it.
goodbye.
dear Attilio, it's as if no time has passed at all.
Attilio?
Fuad, thanks, I'll say goodbye then.
goodbye, Fuad, goodbye.
when are you leaving? -- Right after dinner.
plenty of time!
love you.
what about dinner? -- Sure, any time.
you coming to eat then? -- Sure, any time.
I came here to have tea by myself. -- So did I.
we can have it together! Two teas.
Mr. Poet Attilio De Giovanni, there's absolutely no question.
I don't want to disturb you, heaven forbid.
since we don't see each other often...
you see, the two of us, not immediately...
why do you keep pestering me?
haven't you got anything else to think about?
me think about you? Whoever thinks about you?
someone said they even saw you in Verona!
no, wait!
what's that? Me, in Verona?
who told you that? -- Settembrini.
he saw you outside my hotel for hours.
listen, I was not in Verona.
why on Earth should I care if you're in Verona or Piazza dell'Esquilino?
I don't believe it, you were there too?
I never know where you are and I don't care.
why don't you come to my place?
to see where I live, sleep, read, write, wash the dishes.
we can be together.
yes? Huh?
you tell me who's speaking, you called me.
valeri who?
Yes, I was at Fuad's, why?
in fact, this jacket isn't mine.
this phone isn't either!
this jacket is five times too big, yours must be too small.
pay more attention!
he took my jacket instead of his.
I can't, I'm in a meeting.
Yes, okay.
I'm in the bar round the corner, but right away, I'm busy.
Signor Valeri, over here, how did you mistake my jacket for yours?
it's three sizes larger! -- Yes in fact, I didn't...
Signor Valeri mistook my jacket for his.
didn't you realize it was tight? -- I didn't put it on.
now I know why you didn't realize it.
all's well that ends well, goodbye.
some people are so scatter-brained.
he hardly knew what to say, at one point he said, I love you,
I dream of you every night, let's get married.
what would you have said?
the check, please. -- No, let me.
Thanks. -- Don't mention it.
Vittoria!
how much is it?
keep the change.
the tea had absolutely no taste.
I want to see where you wash your dishes, take me home.
let's walk up, I prefer it. -- Me too.
I've walked down millions of stairs holding your arm, now you're no longer here, there's a void beneath every step.
dammit, I tripped... - Serves you right.
we're here, this is me.
I trip on that wretched step every day.
go ahead.
please do come in, Vittoria.
here we are, Vittoria and I together at home...
I always leave the candles on.
and the television.
I always like to have things ready in case Vittoria comes...
I'll go make some coffee,
I'll make you some too, it won't take a sec...
what's the matter?
nothing, I just burnt myself slightly.
the coffee is ready? -- I make it in case Vittoria comes.
have a seat.
it was coming to the boil as we came in.
here.
I always like to tell the truth.
seeing you sitting here at night alone with me, drinking coffee, it makes my heart race.
you're so beautiful!
women are so beautiful when they're about to make love.
why not live together for the rest of our lives? It's easy.
as easy as seeing a tiger in the snow.
when I do, we will be together forever.
off to Tibet with us then, it always snows on tigers there.
but we live in Rome.
snow falling on a tiger in Rome!
I get it.
please stay and sleep with me.
you've got a man here who loves you.
a man who loves you is a sight worth seeing, isn't it?
it's a cold, grey world outside, stay here.
we can have a nice hot bath together.
I'll dry you, I'll wrap you in a blue bathrobe.
all this, every evening for me, you've forgotten one thing though, the champagne.
explain the rest later, but I want to know how you did that.
you know, tricks of the trade.
but just as I said "champagne."
a bit of luck.
here, Vittoria.
I want to do with you what the spring does with cherries.
now, now, now.
you haven't said anything about the house.
I'd move this table, I'll finish my champagne then go and your books, don't try and stop me, shouldn't be on the floor, it's a bit too bohemian.
there's a time for everything, peach trees don't bloom in December.
this green wall's hideous.
I long to feel your arms around me.
this floor... but I can't...
is office-like.
I'm not sure if I should stay or go.
what'll I do? You decide.
my compliments on your apartment.
I think I know what you're getting at about the apartment,
I think this is the best solution.
as far as the floor's concerned, let's leave it as it is.
about the table, I agree with you, I'd move it, and make more space, I'd put two armchairs there.
for the fittings, I know a carpenter downstairs, so that's sorted.
the floor we said leave as it, the ceiling isn't great...
I wasn't really planning on staying here long,
I'm only renting and I can't remember when my lease ends.
all I know is that tonight'll never come back.
there's just one word on the great clock of time, now.
but you're right about one thing, my love.
that green wall has got to go.
where are you going?
I'm going to put on the blue bathrobe.
if only you knew what I have inside of me, fleets of minesweepers dropping death-charges into my chest, torpedoing my thorax, circumnavigating my heart.
now I can tell you, I was Verona, and in Piazza dell'Esquilino.
two and a quarter hours!
I'm ashamed to say,
I was in Catania too, I never told you.
I dream of you every night, always the same dream, always you.
I see you everywhere, my whole life hears you.
in all creation I feel the beating of your heart.
you these books, the bubbles in my champagne, you're the flame of these candles, these trees, you're down the street...
Vittoria?
Vittoria!
I'll fix her, when I catch her!
Vittoria, I'll sue you!
I'll take you to court!
Vittoria! Vittoria!
wait!
Vittoria!
stop!
Vittoria!
stop this tram!
driver, stop!
Vittoria!
you know what you are?
you're one big daughter of a bitch!
it's raining!
it rains on the city, like tears in my heart.
Oh my beloved, all creation overflows with passion, and like a golden comet in the sky, from my mouth bursts forth this cry.
kiss me!
please my love.
I said kiss me.
Attilio. Attilio!
it's her, the symbolism is so obvious!
I know, I guessed it right away but I'm not kissing a kangaroo, it's revolting.
revolting? Goodbye then, you'll never see me again.
Oh!
Vittoria!
I wasn't talking to you.
Vittoria!
stop!
what a coincidence!
Vittoria!
I was walking along thinking of everything except you...
Vittoria!
what are you doing, leaving?
okay, I get the message.
since I know you're leaving, I just came to tell you this.
it's all over between us, you'll never see me again.
goodbye forever!
sorry, I forgot to tell you something.
Oh Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria!
peace! Peace!
you tell him, I can't in half an hour, Attorney.
go to prison? But I'm in the right!
this is an act of violence. -- War's an act of violence.
hanging out the peace banner never hurt anyone.
I can't in half an hour.
professor!
yes?
mamma Mia, what a bang! Almost killed me!
what the...
stop hopping about like that.
will you please stop hopping?
Vittoria, I will not get into your pouch,
I won't fit, be a good girl.
don't kiss me, I know it's you but stop it.
behave, Vittoria.
Vittoria...
Yes, speaking.
who is it?
who?
Fuad, what a nice surprise!
I'm glad, how are you?
what's wrong?
Vittoria? Of course.
she's there with you, right? She talked about me, eh?
what happened?
is she dead?
I don't know, I just came back from the hospital.
the doctor is afraid she won't make it through the night.
she's alive but there's nothing to be done,
we've got no medicine or supplies here.
we'd nearly finished out work, we were walking in Baghdad, there was an explosion, a building fell.
what?
I don't know, when I opened my eyes she was lying there unconscious.
what's the hospital called?
I'll be there right away, see you soon.
see you soon in Baghdad.
I'll call you as soon as I arrive.
Carla, it's me, I know, sorry but...
everything's fine, don't worry.
they're both fine, they're asleep.
I've got to go away right now.
I'm not sure when, please don't start.
I've got to go, I don't know when.
come early tomorrow morning, I'll leave the keys out, you look after Rosa and Emilia.
good morning. -- Yes?
I'd like a ticket to Baghdad, first available flight.
what?
I said I'd like a ticket to Baghdad, first available flight.
maybe I misheard. -- What's the problem?
not again.
I am at the airport, aren't I? -- Of course.
I'd like a ticket to Baghdad please.
perhaps you haven't heard, but there's a war in Iraq.
there are no flights, there's no longer an airport!
I have to go to Baghdad. -- You can't!
there must be an airport near Baghdad!
give me a ticket for an airport near Baghdad then I'll take a taxi, boat, or walk, that's up to me.
give me the nearest airport -- Nearest to what?
Baghdad!
where do you want to go?
no, just wanted to know... no time to waste.
you're very kind, extremely kind, goodbye.
everything okay?
a ticket for Baghdad!
was he joking?
hi Eleonora, what's for dinner?
they sent the certificate back, you've got to call them.
how are you? You look tired. -- The usual stuff...
apart from this morning some guy comes in all agitated asking for a ticket to Baghdad!
imagine, wanting to go to Baghdad that game day!
a ticket for Baghdad? What was he like?
quite ordinary looking.
like that guy there.
that guy there unloading the crates in Iraq.
it's the splitting image!
Eleonora!
that's him!
will you help me drain the pasta?
how the hell did he manage that?
no, these stay here in Basra, those are got Baghdad.
Where's Gauzzelli?
what is it? -- We've got to leave for Baghdad.
we haven't gotten the okay. -- Yes we have, from Mrs. Serao.
come on, let's go now. -- Start it up!
Mrs. Serao! -- Finally found you.
you're a marvelous, wonderful person.
sorry if I pressed you, but I'm so happy to be here!
thank you, Doctor,
sorry if I seemed doubtful in Rome.
so many people want to help but just end up wasting our time, but we can't get enough of surgeons like you.
thank you, Doctor. -- Thank you, goodbye.
let's go!
can't you go a bit faster? -- No.
shall I drive? -- Why don't you take a nap?
what's the problem?
doctor Guazzelli, why've we stopped?
we just got the order to go back to Basra.
back to Basra?
you crazy?
stop, counter-orders!
how far is it to Baghdad? -- About 100 kilometers.
wait, stop.
I've got to get to Baghdad.
but it's all desert. -- I've got to get to Baghdad.
Thanks, I'll tell Guazzelli, don't worry.
go, go!
Fuad, it's Attilio.
I'm glad you called, I've been trying to reach you all day.
I've found a way to get you to Iraq in a few days.
I'm in Baghdad! -- What do you mean?
there are two huge hands holding two scimitars.
Where's the hospital? -- I don't believe it!
I'll take you, don't move.
Fuad!
you took your time!
how are you? -- Fine. How'd you get to Baghdad?
by bus.
Where's the hospital? Let's go.
we're off.
come along.
where is she? -- Over here.
that's odd... -- What?
she was here last night.
I'm afraid it's a bad sign. -- You're joking!
it's a good sign, they've probably moved her to a convalescent ward.
let's ask, there must be a doctor, a surgeon, a sister a brother...
I'll try and find someone, don't worry.
I'm quite happy.
it's a very good sign, I'm happy she's recovered,
I'll go look for her...
Vittoria?
Vittoria.
see who it is?
see who it is?
what a coincidence!
you in Baghdad, too!
with that blanket on your face you seemed... but you're breathing!
you're looking great.
really great.
they told me you weren't well, I got a bit scared.
what was that?
thought you said something.
you know...
Fuad's gone to talk to this doctor who is just great.
the whole of Baghdad's talking about him.
I said, "Who is he?"
the hospital's empty, he's cured everyone.
I've spoken to him, I'll have you home in a couple of days,
I promise.
found her.
bed stuck away at an angle, a blanket covering her face,
I thought she was dead.
the doctor doesn't speak Italian, I've spoken to him.
the prospects aren't good. -- Why?
great colour in her cheeks...
look, Fuad's here, see?
she's all right.
she's better, she can leave now?
she's better?
what did he say?
there's no hope.
are you nuts, in front of her? She can hear every word.
so she's better, I knew it.
he said there's no hope, but he didn't say she's dead.
is she dead or alive? -- She's alive but...
what does "she's alive but" mean? She's alive!
couldn't be better!
what needs to be done? Ask him.
what did he say? -- Vittoria has a cerebral edema.
she's not reacting, we've got no drugs to treat edemas, this means she'll die soon.
unless we find the right medicine, she takes it, the edema goes and she'll be up and about.
how long do we have to find the medicine?
there must be a pharmacy open! -- There are no medicines in Baghdad!
I got that, but...
ask him how long she's got without this medicine, 30, 34, 47 minutes, get him to tell you something.
what's he say? -- It's all written here.
he wrote the name of the medicine? How long have we got?
no more than four hours.
four hours!
more than enough!
give us time to have a coffee too!
let's go get it, four hours...
let me say goodbye to Victoria.
the doctor said you could come with us, but I reckon more bed rest won't hurt you, get your strength back.
then I'll find you a better spot,
I saw a fancy spot under the stairs where no one comes by.
goodbye.
okay, Fuad.
here's one open.
pharmacist! Anybody there?
pharmacist!
clients!
this one's closed too, now what?
maybe there's one there.
look!
how do you say in Arabic? Bazaar, they've got everything.
give me the prescription, thanks.
they'll have everything there.
good morning, I'm Italian. Do you have this medicine?
I need that. I look around, maybe you have the medicine and maybe you don't remember in this confusion. I have a look. Where is medicine?
medicine?
come along.
you don't have...
they've got Etruscan vases, diving equipment, motor-cycle helmets, and they don't have any medicine!
it's no use, this medicine... -- What does it do?
it's an anti-edema. -- Let's get it made!
who by? -- Don't you know a pharmacist?
a pharmacist? -- You're from Baghdad!
I know one!
Al-Giumeili, an old friend of my father's, a formidable man.
is he home? -- Yes.
I told you so, come on. -- She's gone to ask permission.
he's extremely old, I wonder if he remembers me.
my father used to hold him up as an example of the most noble man he ever knew.
why, what did he do? -- He as a real poet.
he was young, fell in love with a woman and married her.
a few years later while he was fighting in some war, he heard his wife and contracted smallpox and had been disfigured.
so Al-Giumeili said, "My eyes hurt."
and then, "I've gone blind."
when his wife died, 12 years later, he opens his eyes again.
so as not to upset his wife, he pretended to be blind for 12 years?
every person is a chasm, it makes you dizzy to look down...
he never explained to anybody
I'll go and talk to him first then I'll call you.
for me?
it's a present for me?
it's a beautiful present.
come.
Bye. -- Bye.
Attilio.
hello.
thank you.
what did he say? Can we make it in three hours?
I'm sorry, he can't make the medicine we need, he hasn't got any of the equipment, he needs mannitol, cortisone, and various other things.
it's not possible.
maybe I didn't make myself clear.
mannitol, cortisone, what are they?
can you tell him something else?
tell him in Arabic, fifty years ago there was no mannitol or cortisone.
when someone got a bump on the head, people did say, "He's got an edema, he'll be dead soon..."
so what did he, Iraq's foremost scientist, do?
we tried gastric treatment. -- What did they pump into the stomach?
glycerine.
glycerine.
I've heard of that, you see.
where do we buy it? Forget it, I know everything's closed...
can we make some glycerine and feed it into her stomach?
there's a way.
really!
he's trying to remember.
what time is it? How long do we have?
Al-Giumeili my old friend, find me this glycerine.
I know you can, otherwise she's going to die.
if she dies, they can close this whole show of a world...
they can cart if off, unscrew the stars, roll up the sky and put it on a truck, they can turn off this sunlight I love so much, you know why I love it so much?
because I love her when the sun shines on her.
they can take everything away, these carpets, columns, houses, sand, wind, frogs, ripe watermelons, hail, seven in the evening, May, June, July, basil, bees, the sea, courgettes...
courgettes, Al-Giumeili!
get me this glycerine!
what's he say? -- Butter, palm oil, olive oil.
the base is soda, but ashes will do, fat and ashes.
it might work, I've got it all, we can do it in a couple of hours.
a thousand thanks, Al-Giumeili.
thank you.
I reckon it's ready, come here!
a little more ash. -- No, we've got quite enough.
doesn't need any more. -- Just another spoonful.
thank you, Fuad, for everything.
I'll do this, go have a rest.
did you get any sleep? -- A little, in this chair.
Al-Giumeili intimidated me a bit. Was that his daughter?
she's the last wife of his son Ali.
he was murdered six months ago, he was a real free spirit.
saddam Hussein didn't like free spirits.
poor Al-Giumeili.
time has left me nothing to sustain my eyes and my heart.
come on, Fuad, if this stuff works we'll have dinner and celebrate.
good, eh?
it's home made, hand-made by me and Fuad, no preservatives, colorings, chemicals, just like home-made tagliatelle, "butter please, oil please, chop some onions, put in garlic," really delicious, Fuad and I both had second helpings.
fuad wanted a third but I said, "No, leave some for Vittoria!"
you're looking well, I tidied you up...
really well.
I was forgetting, look what I've got!
hang on, close your eyes.
close them!
open your eyes.
open!
I'll hang it here, okay?
how's that? I banged my head!
I'll be getting an edema next! It's full of flies here!
you like it? Look.
take a quick look, tell me whether it's okay or not.
one second...
did you move? I thought before you were like that...
she looks worse than ever to me.
that brew didn't do much good.
I'll go have a word with the doctor, a personal matter, be right back.
doctor?
doctor, excuse me, doctor. Excuse me, but ahh...she seems worse. The glycerine didn't help.
didn't help at all? -- No.
without it she'd be dead already. It's a miracle she's still alive.
now we must wait and hope that the medicines arrive soon.
doctor, if I can lend a hand, if you need anything I...
thank you, I will get to her as soon as possible.
yes...
Hey, what are you doing?
doctor! Who the hell is he?
where do you think you're going?
who are you?
what have you done to her?
doctor, he was leaning over Vittoria like this. What did he want?
this, I suspect.
Vittoria's chain.
you have thieves in the hospital?
I think it's better if you keep that. It's a nightmare...
...Looters everywhere. The Americans promised us some security people let's hope they get here soon.
doctor, how is she, she looks very pale.
do you think she can breathe all right?
she could probably do with some oxygen.
goodbye for now.
thank you, excuse me Doctor.
you breathing?
breathe, Vittoria.
the only ones breathing are the flies.
damnit, where do they get so much oxygen?
it's a nightmare. I'll go find you some oxygen right away.
hang on.
poor doctor, hasn't even got any band-aids.
Hi, it's Attilio.
by any chance to you have an oxygen tank at home?
Yes, oxygen tank.
you might have forgotten you had one...
you don't know anyone who might have some oxygen?
got it!
don't worry, don't need it any longer.
thanks bye.
I'll get you some oxygen, I know where.
I'll go fetch it.
goodbye Vittoria.
mamma Mia!
the Biblical injunction "Thou shalt not kill
is one that requires qualification in view of our broader knowledge of impulses behind homicide.
the various legal categories such as first and second degree murder, the various degrees of homicide, manslaughter, are civilized recognitions of impulses of various degrees of culpability.
the man who kills in self defense, for instance, must not be judged by the same standards applied to the man who kills for gain.
so, what are you doing tonight?
I'm having dinner with Lalor and Barkstane at the club.
well, I just don't want you to stay cooped up every night working all the time.
I won't, I promise you. I'll get out.
all right, dear. I should think you would after classes all day.
but once you get your nose into a book...
mama, they're going. - Yes, dear.
goodbye, darling. I'm so sorry you're not going with us.
so am I, but you have a good time. Don't you worry about me.
will you miss me?
every minute of the day. Every second of the night.
mama. - Bye, sweetie.
kiss Daddy goodbye.
goodbye, you little brats.
so long, Pops. - So long.
and mind Mother. Both of you.
yes sir. - Watch Vicky.
Yes, I will, dear.
man: New York Telegram, World Post. Get your papers.
Frank. - What?
look.
flirting with our sweetheart? - Hello, Michael.
how are you, Frank? - Glad to see you, Richard.
who is she? - Haven't the faintest idea.
but we've decided she's our dream girl just from that picture.
that's right. We saw her first.
well, it's an extraordinary portrait.
extraordinary woman too, I bet.
well, what's the program now, huh?
stork Club? Billy Rose's?
well, I hate to disappoint you, gentlemen, but the program as far as I'm concerned is one cigar, another drink and early to bed.
I have a lecture at 9: 00 tomorrow morning, and I expect to deliver it without sport.
do you mean to sit there and tell us that on the first night of your summer bachelorhood, you're not even going to a burlesque show?
no, but if one of the young ladies wishes to come over here and perform about there,
I'll only be too happy to watch.
incredible. - Absolutely shameful.
it's outraging tradition.
well, look, I'm a middle-aged man. We all are.
we are three old crocks. That sort of shenanigan is out for us.
just a minute.
I don't know if I like being described as an old crock.
no, Michael, he's right, I'm afraid.
and it's a darn good thing too. Men our age...
I didn't say that. I didn't say it was a good thing.
cause I don't know that it is.
all I know is that I hate it.
I hate this solidity, the stodginess I am beginning to feel.
to me it's the end of the brightness of life, the end of spirit and adventure.
don't talk like that.
men of our years have no business playing around with any adventure that they can avoid.
we're like athletes who are out of condition.
we can't handle that sort of thing anymore.
life ends at 40?
in the district attorney's office, we see what happens to middle-aged men who try to act like colts.
and I'm not joking when I tell you that I've seen genuine, actual tragedy issuing directly out of pure carelessness, out of the merest trifles.
casual impulse, an idle flirtation, one drink too many.
how many is that?
third, isn't it? - Great Scott, he's lost count already.
he's a strictly two-drink man, always has been for years.
I'm sorry if I sound stuffy.
but trouble starts, too, from little things, often from some forgotten natural tendency.
Yes, but I have a date for an idle flirtation with Lana Turner that we worked out.
tomorrow night?
very good. Why don't we make it every night?
the three of us, unless we've got something better to do.
fine, that's a good idea.
I think I'll roll along with you. - Splendid.
maybe Lana can dig up Rita Hayworth for you.
well, what about me?
do you think it quite safe to leave me alone in this somewhat rebellious state of mind?
no, no. You'll be all right, I'm sure.
just you run along to bed like a good fellow and forget the whole matter.
he's much too old for the sort of thing we have in mind, isn't he?
now, be good.
Dick, I really would like... - Oh, stop worrying.
you know, I don't agree with a word you've said.
but the disagreement is purely academic.
you know, that's exactly my complaint.
the flesh is still strong but the spirit grows weaker by the hour.
good.
you know, even if the spirit of adventure should rise up before me and beckon, even in the form of that alluring young woman in the window next door,
I'm afraid that all I'll do is clutch my coat a little tighter, mutter something idiotic and run like the devil.
not before you got her number, I hope.
probably.
good night.
you're safe, I guess. Good night, Dick.
Oh, thank you.
would you be good enough to remind me when it's 10: 30?
Yes, sir.
sometimes I'm inclined to lose track of time.
I'll remind you, sir.
thank you, sir.
collins: It's 10: 30, Professor Wanley.
it's 10: 30, sir.
would you mind putting it back in the library?
Yes, sir. - Thank you.
my hat, please.
I... I couldn't have drunk that much.
you did pose for it, didn't you?
well, then my admiration for the artist is definite.
it's not only a good painting, it's also you.
you know that so quickly?
I don't know it. I only know that if I were a painter and had done this of you,
I would be very happy about it.
is it yours? - No. I wish it were.
then I wouldn't have to come over here every so often to watch people's faces.
is that what you do? - Now and then, when I'm lonely.
tonight? - I was alone.
I don't like to be.
well, did you watch my face?
Oh, yes.
did I react properly? Normally?
well, there are two general reactions.
one is a kind of solemn stare for the painting.
and the other?
the other is a long, low whistle.
what was mine?
I'm not sure.
but I suspect, in another moment or two, you might have given a long, low, solemn whistle.
well, that rather embarrasses me.
Oh, it shouldn't.
I regard it as an unusually sincere compliment because you don't look to me like a man much given to whistling.
Oh, no, no. It's not that exactly, but if my admiration was that obvious, I'm afraid you might misunderstand...
may I help you? - Could you?
I'm not married, I have no designs on you, and one drink is all I'd care for.
is that right? - That's right.
thank you very much.
what's so funny?
well, I had dinner with a couple of friends tonight.
we discussed your portrait with great admiration, I might say.
I'm thinking of their faces tomorrow night when I tell them about this.
sitting and chatting over a drink with the charming young lady herself.
would you like to see some more of his work?
I would indeed.
I'd like it very much.
then, when you've finished your drink, you can take me home and I'll show them to you.
they're just sketches but quite good, I think.
they're of me, of course.
a little late, isn't it?
is that late? 11: 00?
I don't think I should.
you don't think you should? What do you mean?
I was warned.
you mean, you're afraid? Of me?
no, no, no. It's not that, but...
I was warned against the siren call of adventure at my age.
I should never have stopped to talk with you.
I should never, never have come here to drink with you.
never?
come in.
may I have your hat? - Yes, thank you.
make yourself at home.
I'll be right back.
clemens, who did the one in the window, did these.
just sketches, but nice, I think.
beautiful.
let's have another.
I should say no, I know, but I haven't the slightest intention of saying it.
I should say not.
this is much too pleasant to break up.
Ouch! - Did you cut yourself?
no, but the wire broke.
have you something to cut it with?
scissors all right? - Yes, I think that will do.
who are you?
my name is... - Frank!
Frank, God! Listen!
I told you, if you ever...
stop that, you fool. - Fool, huh?
Frank! Frank! Stop!
stop! Frank!
is...
is he...
what...
what are we going to do?
I don't know.
call the police, I suppose.
what was his name?
Howard.
Frank Howard.
that's what he told me.
don't you think it was?
I don't know.
I don't think so, but I don't know.
he never told me anything else.
where he lived, what he did, anything.
I saw him two or three times a week, perhaps.
he never took me out to dinner or a show or anything.
what... What are you...
Where's the telephone?
in the bedroom.
woman: Operator.
operator, get me...
operator. Operator.
you say nobody has ever seen you with him?
we've never been out together.
when you met him?
that was on a train.
Why?
who knows at all about you and him?
unless he told someone, which I doubt, nobody.
you've never mentioned him to anybody?
not his name.
not even the name he gave me.
do you think there's something we can do?
I was just wondering.
I was wondering if anybody could have seen him coming in here tonight.
I'm sure not.
he wouldn't even get out of the cab if there was anyone around.
do you think there's something we can do?
do you? I don't want to go to jail.
try to keep calm. Please.
let's think about it a minute. Let's see if there is anything.
they'll never believe us, you know.
no, I'm afraid they won't, but even if they did, we wouldn't be much better off.
they'll say we can make up any kind of story we wanted to.
who else saw it?
they'll make it some kind of murder, I know they will.
please.
I have no feeling about him.
he was trying to kill me, there's no question about that.
if I hadn't killed him, he'd have killed me.
if you hadn't given me the scissors, I'd be dead.
but whatever they believe,
I'm ruined, my whole life.
you were thinking of something.
what was it?
I was wondering if we had the nerve for something, something pretty dangerous that would shut the door on us completely if we were caught.
anything you say.
I don't want to go to jail! I don't!
it's this.
if nobody knows about you, if nobody saw him coming in here tonight, how could either of us be connected with it if his body were found miles and miles away from here?
but how?
I'd have to go and get my car.
I'll park it directly in front of the door.
and then we'll pick our moment.
you'll watch while I carry it out and put it in the back.
and then I'll dump it somewhere in the country.
it'll be found of course, sooner or later, but maybe not for a week.
you mean, you'll go for your car while I wait here?
would you be afraid? - Not of that.
if you got out of here, why should you ever come back?
I like you. I think you're all right, but I don't even know your name.
and I don't think there's a man in the world that wouldn't get out of a mess like this if he could.
Oh, we mustn't quarrel.
if we do that, we're lost, both of us.
why can't I go with you?
well...
I'm hoping we can get ourselves out of this completely.
but there's one condition.
I won't tell you my name, what I do, or take you to get the car, because then you'd know where I live.
but if we're successful tonight, it'll be of no importance to you.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
you leave something here.
leave your vest with me.
that would be a clue if you didn't come back.
well, that's fair enough.
there's almost no blood outside, fortunately.
have you a dark blanket we can wrap him in?
I have one.
the trouble is, I have no idea what the police can do with clues.
a great deal, I'm sure.
I've read of things little short of miraculous by the city police, as well as the FBI, from a piece of cloth or even a button.
I'll have to take the subway, so I probably won't be able to make it much under three quarters of an hour.
maybe an hour.
but even if I'm longer than that, don't worry.
don't get panicky and call the police, because I promise you I'll be back. I won't fail you.
now, look outside, will you? - Yes.
nobody.
keep your nerve. We'll make it.
I'd like my car, please.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Charlie. - CHARLIE: Yeah?
professor Wanley's car. - Right away.
kind of late for you, isn't it? - Yes, later than I expected.
Hey, you know Mr. Warne in your building?
Yes.
4: 00 Sunday morning, he got in.
better get them brakes adjusted, first chance you get. They're pretty loose.
I will.
pull over to the curb.
don't you ever turn your lights on at night?
I'm sorry, I thought the garage man turned them on.
let's see your driver's license.
Wanley, huh? What's that, Polish?
no, it's American. - Do you have any other identification?
I have a letter here from the board of education.
professor, huh? - Assistant.
okay, but watch those lights from now on.
everything all right? - Everything is just as you left it.
the name on the mail box is Reed, Alice Reed, in case you have to come again.
well, if we're lucky, I don't think there'll be any occasion for that.
is that the blanket? - Yes.
first, I imagine we've got to get rid of the more obvious means of identification.
I've already done that.
you searched him? - It had to be done, didn't it?
no letters or anything with a name on it?
no. But...
he told me Frank Howard. That's all I know.
all right, tie it all up and tomorrow get on one of the ferries, not during a rush hour, and drop it overboard.
and be very careful that you aren't seen. - The money, too?
you might as well keep it. I don't see how that can be traced.
what about the watch? - Do exactly as I tell you. Please.
otherwise we might as well give ourselves up now.
we can't afford to overlook one detail.
we've got to think of everything in advance.
remember that. - I will.
how about this rug?
there's only a little spot. I can get that out myself.
well, do it very thoroughly, will you?
I've read of laboratory tests that make the fine signs of blood that the naked eye could never see.
I can clean it.
and the scissors, you better boil them.
something might be left on the neck of them.
all right. - Is there anything else that we forgot?
his hat.
help me with the table.
now, when I leave here, I want you to go over the whole place thoroughly.
wash these glasses, put them back on the shelf.
get rid of these bottles. Clean everything thoroughly.
there mustn't be one sign left that you had any visitor tonight.
him, me or anybody else.
give me that paper.
I'll give you the blanket back as soon as I've got him in the car.
they'll examine it very carefully too.
I'll clean everything. I won't go to bed until I've cleaned every single place.
now, put out the lights.
go out and see.
all clear.
thank you.
I won't see you again, I suppose.
for both our sakes, I hope this ends the whole thing completely and forever.
all right then, goodbye.
goodbye.
Hey, come back here.
what was it? A dime? - Never mind. Here's another.
well, it couldn't have gone far.
that's all right. If you find it later, you can have it.
Thanks. Hey, this is a penny.
sorry. - That's okay.
well, thanks for the dime if I find it.
excellent port, that. - Yes.
William, check please. - Yes, sir.
this is mine tonight. - Thank you.
did Frank say what kept him?
something important, I imagine. He sounded excited.
well, I can't quite picture Frank excited.
here you are, sir. - Must have left mine.
thank you, sir.
coffee in the lounge. - Very well, sir.
he was talking from the police commissioner's office.
Ah, there he is.
well, shall we go back?
no, I'm not going to eat now. I'm gonna have a drink.
how are you, Richard? - Fine, thank you. Account for yourself.
frank: Come inside, you'll be interested in this.
Oh, Collins, get me an Old Fashioned, will you?
Yes, sir.
let's go over here. - Hot news?
very.
but confidential for the moment. Claude Mazard has disappeared.
Claude Mazard? - Yes.
Michael: But how do you mean disappeared?
exactly what the word means.
he left Washington yesterday afternoon, and he arrived at Penn Station last night and from there he's literally disappeared.
is that the promoter? - My dear Richard, don't be vulgar.
when a promoter has promoted a colossus like World Enterprises Incorporated, he's no longer a promoter, he's a financier.
Oh, yes, yes, of course. I remember now. - We're gonna wait until...
no, not for me. I've got an Old Fashioned coming.
going to wait until midnight on the odd chance he shows up.
but if he hasn't checked in by then, we'll give it to the papers and then watch the fireworks.
the market? - And how.
what did he look like? Or rather, I mean...
what sort of fellow was he? - MICHAEL: A true perfect nuisance.
he was a patient of mine for a while. - For what?
nerves, blood pressure.
he had the most ungovernable temper I've ever known.
he had no idea how pleased I was when he called me a quack and stomped out.
well, just because a man doesn't show up for a day,
I see no reason to assume that he's been murdered.
I didn't say he was murdered.
attendant: Mr. Lalor. Oh, Mr. Lalor. - Yes.
telephone, Mr. Lalor. - Thank you. Excuse me.
I... I don't know why I said that.
I suppose it's because of his whole manner.
the way he talked seemed to indicate murder, - Violence of some kind. - It did. That's what he's suspicious of, too.
he has an uncanny instinct for things like that.
the old head goes up like a bird-dog's.
Yes, I can imagine he'd be pretty terrifying once he got the scent.
you bet.
announcer ON RADIO: 12: 00 and the midnight news from station WPQ with the courtesy of Castola Rex, that tangy, bracing acid remedy for that tired feeling.
but first, a word about Castola Rex.
wise Mother Nature has balanced the chemical contents of the gastric juices so carefully that heart burn, acid stomach, or an upset digestive system resulting from over indulgence in food and drink can blight a person's whole outlook on life.
but why suffer when Castola Rex,
mother Nature's own helping hand, is available at your nearest drug store?
try it today and everyday. Now for the news.
the police have just announced the mysterious disappearance of Claude Mazard, founder of the fabulous public utilities empire of World Enterprises Incorporated, under circumstances indicating foul play.
at the same time, World Enterprises Incorporated have offered a reward of $10, 000
for any information as to his whereabouts, dead or alive.
after checking a briefcase at Pennsylvania Station about 10: 30 last night...
I was practicing woodcraft in the woods just off the Bronx River Parkway extension when I found Mr. Mazard's remains.
no, I was not scared. A Boy Scout is never scared.
if I get the reward,
I will send my younger brother to some good college and I will go to Harvard.
I think we can be pretty confident about this one.
looks easy to you? - Well, not exactly easy, but not too tough.
plenty of clues, eh? - Some.
and the circumstances add up, so far.
for instance, he wasn't killed in the woods, of course.
he was killed somewhere else and the body taken to the spot where it was found.
how do you know that? - We got the tire marks of a parked car.
that's as good as a fingerprint, so far as the car's concerned.
but how do you know it was the murderer's car?
frank: Footprints in the same soft ground leading from the car and back to it.
deep prints when he was going into the wood, carrying something heavy. Lighter coming back, without his burden.
not much question as to that, is there?
no, I suppose not.
we got photographs and plaster casts of everything.
while that doesn't help us to name a man, once we've lined up on a suspect, there'll be a positive check on him.
especially the shoe prints.
how's that?
well, the print of new shoes isn't of much use, but these were well-worn shoes, and from the print of a worn shoe, we can learn a great deal about the wearer's weight, height, length of stride, any peculiarity of gait he may have.
could you tell that from these? - Yes.
the man weighs in the neighborhood of 160 pounds, wears an eight shoe and is probably of moderate circumstances.
you're rather guessing at that last, aren't you?
no.
the shoes have been half-soled.
we have a number of bits of evidence like that.
but the trouble with them, as you say, is they don't offer leads.
they only offer checks, like the kind of suit he wore.
do you know that too? - Yes, and his blood.
the keen-eyed Inspector Jackson found some on a wire fence over which the body was dropped.
he probably scratched his hand lifting it over.
Yes, but a trace like that on a barbed wire fence, could that be enough to be of any use?
did I say a barbed wire fence?
didn't you? - No.
well, what other kind could a man more naturally scratch his hand on?
it was a barbed wire fence, of course.
I was only trying to impress you fellows with my keenness.
can't a man get any credit around here at all?
then in that case, I'll give you an opportunity to impress the whole city.
does this suggest anything to you?
Yes. It suggests very strongly that you're eaten up with envy.
you see my name on the front page of every paper, so you make a desperate effort to elbow your way into my case by insinuating that you are the guilty man.
but it's no use, my boy. You scratched yourself for nothing.
did you ever see such selfishness?
did you put anything on it? - Yes, some antiseptic.
how did you do it? - Last night, I cut it on a tin can.
well, watch it. - So I will.
frank: Would you like to hear exactly how the police figure it happened?
Yes. - You bet we would.
well, come in the lounge.
Oh, thanks. - Good night.
good night, sir.
coffee and cigars inside, Boris. - BORIS: Yes, sir.
William, check in the lounge. - Very well, Mr. Lalor.
we got a line on a woman this afternoon.
Frank? - Yes?
Hello, Mark.
may I see you for a moment? - Certainly.
I'll join you in a minute.
great stuff knowing a district attorney. Get all the inside dope.
Yes.
Frank's a very smart man. - Yes.
you're a bit off your feet, aren't you? - Just a bit, I suppose.
haven't been sleeping very well.
missing the family, eh? - Yes, very much.
Yes, well, I think you could do with a few pills.
you're not the absent-minded-professor type, are you?
I've tried not to be.
two a day is all right. Should pep you up considerably.
but I'd hate to think of you wandering foggily into the bathroom, popping them into your mouth like salted peanuts.
poison? - No, not in the technical sense.
it's a gland concentrate.
too much would hit the old heart like a sledgehammer.
instantly?
well, a matter of 20 or 30 minutes and... Bang.
what's that? - Prescription for Richard.
it not only kills you if you take enough of it, it leaves no trace.
just a case of heart disease," that's all they could say.
I suppose there's no way of telling how many of your patients you've disposed of in that way.
none whatever, so forget it.
you said they've located the woman.
not quite. The police theory this afternoon was this,
Mazard, a bachelor, had a sweetheart.
his business associates are quite sure of that.
but who she is or where she lives, they don't know.
pretty nervous man in romance, it seems.
at any rate, when he reached Penn Station, he went to call on her.
either a man was already there or he came during Mazard's visit.
and this man the lady preferred over Mazard.
why do they think that?
well, otherwise, if her true love had been killed, she would have most likely done something to bring the killer to justice.
this is just a theory, of course? - I said that.
so they fought and Mazard was killed, probably with a pair of scissors.
that's the medical examiner's belief, anyway.
then in a panic, they loaded the body into a car, his or hers, and took it to the place where it was found.
now these two people, this man and this woman, sit hating and fearing each other, each wondering how long it'll be before the other is caught and blabs out the whole story.
always a woman, eh? - Wait, I'm not through.
that, I said, was the theory this afternoon.
and what is it now?
well, now it's anybody's guess. Something came up just as I left the office that pulls the rug right out from under that theory.
Really?
it seems that Mazard's associates, always afraid he'd get into trouble with his temper, had engaged a man, a bodyguard, to follow him secretly at all times.
on that night, too? - That we don't know.
we don't know because he's disappeared as well.
then there's your murderer, isn't it? - Could be, but not necessarily.
then why hasn't he shown up?
it's not that simple. He could have murdered Mazard, yes.
he might have tried to blackmail him and killed him in the fight.
or he might have witnessed the killing and is getting ready to blackmail the killers.
but even if he's 100% innocent, he still won't walk in and talk.
why not?
because he's hot. He's a known crook with a blackmailing record.
that's why he was thrown off the force, for shaking people down.
he's wanted for at least two other raps.
we'll get that gentleman when we run him down and not before.
nice fellow to pick for a bodyguard.
Oh, don't ask me why. Wall Street geniuses do anything.
he's tough and strong, and I suppose that's all they thought of it.
anyway, I'm going up tomorrow morning to have a look over this place where they dumped the body.
either of you fellows like to go with me?
sorry, I wish I could, but I'm operating in the morning.
Richard? - Oh, I'm afraid that...
Oh, you go with him.
you've got no classes tomorrow, you told me so.
Yes, I know, but...
he'll go. I'm his physician, I order him to.
it'll give you something to think about. What time?
I'll pick you up at your apartment at 9: 30. - Very well, I'll be ready.
good. We'll try to show you how the law operates to nail a man.
Richard?
this is quite an adventure for me.
anything new? - Nothing very important.
Fred. - Yes, sir.
we're picking up Jackson at the toll gate. - Right, sir.
district attorney's office.
frank: Any luck?
fellows is not on duty. We'll check at his home this afternoon.
inspector Jackson, Professor Wanley.
how do you do, Inspector? - Pleased to meet you, sir.
excuse my left hand, I have a little cut.
Oh, yes. How's it coming? - All right, it's nothing.
how did you say you did it?
I was opening a can in the kitchen the other night and the can opener slipped.
what was in the can? Poison ivy?
I'm... I'm afraid that was pure stupidity.
the next day I was looking for a lost golf ball and evidently I got into some poison ivy.
you must have scratched it. That's a pretty bad infection.
well, it's an awful nuisance, I know that.
is this your case, Inspector? - For the moment.
they're all his cases, all the tough ones.
inspector Jackson is head of the homicide bureau.
Oh.
anything new since I left?
well, we picked up that woman this morning.
frank: Good. What's she got to say for herself?
jackson: Well, we'll see her when we get there. They're bringing her up.
inspector. - Good morning, Captain.
you know Mr. Lalor, don't you? - You bet.
very glad to see you, Mr. Lalor. - Glad to see you, Captain.
and this is Professor Wanley. - That's right.
captain Kennedy. - Pleased to meet you, Captain.
pleased to meet you, Professor. - Is that woman here yet?
KENNED Y: Beck has her in the car.
frank: Well, let's go over this layout first. Then we'll get to her.
all right, Inspector. - Over here.
now, here is where he parked his car.
the tire tracks are gone, of course, but we have casts and photographs.
they're Goodrich 716s, between 15, 000 and 20, 000 miles, standard equipment on two or three popular make of cars.
the motorcycle officer on duty remembers seeing a Cadillac at the traffic signal.
that may be worth keeping in mind. - Did he see who was in it?
Yes, the driver, a man. But he doubts very much if he could identify him.
so I don't think that's gonna lead us anywhere.
well, anyway, he got the body here. Where'd he take it?
I'll show you.
we got casts of his shoes going and coming.
Richard. - What?
you're going to be the guide?
am I going right?
as straight as an arrow. Professor, eh?
say, you think we'd better look into this, Mr. Lalor?
well, that's very funny. I wasn't even thinking where I was going. I...
I was just thinking what the Inspector said.
that's all right, Richard, don't get excited.
we rarely arrest people just for knowing where the body was.
I don't imagine our killer was very familiar with this spot, because the fence was too near the road for his purposes.
at any rate, he couldn't go much further without a great deal of difficulty.
so he just dumped it over down there.
now, there isn't anything in particular to see except you wanna keep the whole setting in mind.
he tore his coat, probably his sleeve, as he lifted it over, because we picked up a couple of shreds of woolen fiber.
couldn't have been from Mazard's clothes?
no, different material.
and we got a sample of blood from this barb.
he certainly didn't pick himself an easy job.
Mazard weighed close to 200 pounds, you know.
Yes, it must have been pretty tough going.
Yes, especially at night.
well, yes, it may have been at night. - I suppose so.
but I was thinking of it as early morning, along about daylight.
well, I thought the paper said night.
anything else, sir?
I can't think of anything else. You, Richard?
well, why ask me?
I'm simply bowled over by the amount of information the police have got out of such apparently insignificant details.
well, it's hardly spectacular. Really police routine, so far.
but there is one thing we have in our department that is really worthwhile, Professor.
what's that? - Patience.
I imagine so.
wanna see the woman? - Might as well.
what's that for?
Oh, I had one of the men put that there this morning so you wouldn't brush against that bush.
it's poison ivy. - Very thoughtful, Captain.
well, too late to do me any good. - That's right.
looks as if you have a little more explaining to do, Richard.
closing in on me, huh?
if you'll only confess, Professor, we could wrap up this whole case before noon.
well, not me. I'm afraid you'll have to work for this one, Inspector.
there you go, you've never any consideration for us poor cops.
let's have the woman. - Yes, sir.
all right? - All right.
if you don't mind, I'll go and sit in the car for a little while.
I'm not feeling very well.
what's the matter, Richard? It's not serious, is it?
Oh, no, no, no, not at all. You go on, I'll be all right.
well, if you need me...
no, no, you go right ahead.
well, that's all.
we can go now.
well, goodbye, Professor. Hope you'll be feeling better soon.
thank you.
well, what do you think?
the woman?
you think she's the one?
I don't know.
she's got something on her conscience.
but what woman hasn't?
Yes. Where did they find her?
second-class hotel off Broadway.
I don't know. She seems a bit dingy to me for Mazard.
he'd do better than that, I'm sure.
Cheap-looking?
bottom of the barrel.
it's the bodyguard who is hot now, anyway.
Hello?
how...
how did you find...
have you seen the early editions?
no. - Your picture's in The Times.
Congratulations.
will you tell me what you mean?
listen.
Dr. George Felix Reynolds, president of Gotham College, "yesterday announced the promotion of Dr. Richard Wanley "to head of the Department of Psychology.
Oh.
Oh, of course, I wasn't expecting it before.
did I frighten you?
a bit.
is everything all right?
I suppose so.
you've heard nothing from anybody?
have you?
no.
not so far.
Oh, I'm not worrying now.
I'm sure we're out of it.
aren't you?
I hope so.
and I'm not going to bother you, believe me.
Oh, it's quite all right.
I'm rather glad that I've heard from you.
good night and thank you.
good night.
yes? -MAN: Miss Reed?
who is this? -Open up.
I wanna have a little talk with you about our friend Mr. Mazard.
I don't know you and I don't know your friend Mr. Mazard, so beat it.
listen, you don't want me to get tough, do you?
I don't care how tough you get. You're not coming in here at this hour.
I'm not kidding, lady.
either you open this door, or I'm going to the police.
well, will you say what you've got to say and get out of here?
sure.
if you didn't hear it, it was on the radio tonight.
another reward for $10, 000 for any information leading to the arrest of the murderer of Claude Mazard.
you didn't hear it?
and if I had, it wouldn't have meant one thing to me.
now, if you're gonna start claiming you never knew him, you can save your breath.
because I've been tailing him for months, and I've tailed him here many a time.
he's been here.
but not under that name.
I never knew anything about who he was until I saw his picture in the paper, after he was killed.
so you're the one that's wasting your breath.
well, let's see if I am.
don't mind my looking around a little, do you?
you bet I do!
I know nothing whatever about the death of Mr. Mazard, - And you've got no right to... - Listen.
take it easy, will you?
it's been in the papers that they're looking for some woman he knew.
and I'm telling you you're the only one.
but have you been to them and explained to them how you had nothing to do with it?
of course not! It's not me they're looking for.
Oh, come now, Miss Reed.
what are you looking for?
I can't tell you till I find it.
I'd settle for some blood or a photograph.
or a confession.
or some hairs.
any little thing like that.
some brown, some black.
Mr. Mazard's was brown.
no.
all wiped clean, huh?
pretty good housekeeper, I guess.
Yes, sir, clean as a whistle.
not a finger mark anywhere.
not even where you'd think they'd be naturally.
could be, you know.
those little stabs.
that ain't Claude Mazard, and it ain't Alice Reed.
and you had it hid, too.
what's his first name?
Robert?
Richard?
Oh, I'm getting warm, all right. No question about that in my mind.
all right. What do you want?
now you're talking.
I don't want to make trouble for anybody.
I can, of course, but I don't want to.
but the way I figure it, you just don't want the police nosing around in any of your business.
isn't that right?
who does? - That's what I mean.
so I'll tell you how we can fix it.
there's a $10, 000 reward out for just the kind of information I've got.
but I don't see it that way.
the way I see it, if I got $5, 000 from you, that'd be the end of it, so far as I'm concerned.
are you nuts? - From you and the guy I mean.
I haven't got $5, 000 and there isn't any guy to get it from, so you may as well go right along to the police and tell them whatever you wish.
now, you don't want me to do a thing like that, Miss Reed.
Mr. Mazard was a very rich man, and you can't tell me you didn't get something off him.
and don't forget, you'll be a lot better off dealing with me than you would with the homicide squad.
you don't want to go to the chair, do you?
I want you out of here.
that's all I want.
I've a pin and bracelet he gave me worth more than $1, 000.
will you take them and get out of here?
no, ma'am. Nothing like that.
nothing but cash.
five grand.
cash.
as a matter of fact, you're simply bluffing.
if you can get $10, 000 from the police, why would you be satisfied with $5, 000 from me?
what if I told you to just get out of here and go whistle for it?
you want to take a chance on that?
you see, honey, you did it, you and this guy.
otherwise, you wouldn't even be talking to me about it.
if you had been in the clear, you would have called the cops the minute I walked in. I know that.
so you gotta look at it my way, don't you see?
I have to think it over.
I have to have some time.
that's okay, I'm not pushing you.
take tonight and tomorrow. Think it over, see if I am right.
see the guy, explain it to him.
and I'll be back here tomorrow night at 8: 30 for the dough.
cash.
but don't try to run away or pull any tricks like that, because I'll be keeping an eye on things pretty close.
good night, and don't fret.
you get the money and that'll be the end of the whole thing.
something's happened. I've got to see you right away.
what else did he find?
your pencil.
I kept it because...
because I wasn't sure of you then.
I wanted something.
Oh, well, it's done now.
are you angry with me? - About the man?
no, I can't think of anything else you could have done.
I don't expect you to pay all the money.
I have a little and I can raise a little more on that bracelet, and some other things Mr. Mazard gave me.
you're very fair, Alice. Quite generous.
it's worth it to get rid of him.
well, paying him $5, 000 isn't getting rid of him.
that's just the first installment.
if we pay him once, it'll go on as long as we live.
but we've got to, haven't we?
if we don't, he'll set the cops on us. I'm sure of it.
so am I. That's what blackmail means.
you pay or the blow falls.
what can we do?
there are only three ways to deal with a blackmailer.
you can pay him and pay him and pay him until you're penniless.
or you can call the police yourself and let your secret be known to the world.
or you can kill him.
good evening. - Good evening.
will this take long?
I have it ready in powders.
will that be all right? - Yes, I suppose so.
same dosage.
you needn't wrap it.
how much? - Three and a quarter.
if you got any children, you better not leave that laying around loose.
I won't.
up. - Down.
sorry.
down.
were you followed? Do you know?
I don't think so. - Did you look?
Yes, but there wasn't anybody, I'm sure.
is it the police? - Now, please, Alice.
if you want to play, you must do your homework first.
if you do your homework first then you can go...
mom.
down. - Up.
I give you my word of honor that there isn't a thing to say the police know we're alive.
believe me, please. - I'm all right, go on.
there's $5, 000 in that package, but if you run into any kind of difficulty, don't let him have but part of it.
tell him that's all you could get today, that he'll have to come back sometime tomorrow evening for the rest.
do you understand? - I understand.
what about the...
that's in there, too. It's a powder.
but you needn't worry about his seeing it because it dissolves almost instantly.
how much? - You'll find a note about that in there.
I don't know what else we can do, Alice.
but if you don't think you can go through with it, we'll try and think out another plan.
there's nothing else we can do.
I know that.
how soon does it work?
it takes effect, I'm told, in 20 or 25 minutes.
so you better make sure he's out of your apartment.
all right.
you better go now.
wish me luck.
good luck.
if you lose your nerve, don't get frightened.
we'll find another way.
I won't lose my nerve.
miss Reed? -ALICE: Yes?
it's me, open up.
who else you got here? - Nobody.
I didn't know but what you might have got some cute idea.
no.
pretty dolled up, huh? Is that for me?
I'm glad if you like it, of course. - It's okay.
that Mazard knew how to pick 'em, all right.
will you sit down for a minute?
sure, but make it short, will you?
$5, 000 is a lot of money. - Uh-oh.
it's a lot for me anyhow and I haven't been able to raise it on such short notice.
and what am I supposed to do about that?
I only want you to be reasonable, that's all.
I want you to give me a little more time.
how much have you got?
2900
that's what I thought. - What do you mean?
that's the kind of a figure, I'd say, if I had some other idea in mind.
not too little, not too big.
don't you believe me? - Stop kidding.
let's have it.
come on.
I can get the rest by tomorrow night, if it's all right with you.
who told you to say all this?
nobody.
nobody, huh?
is it all right?
you're pretty cute, you know that?
is it all right?
well, what else can I do if you haven't got it?
I think I need a drink.
would you like one? - I don't mind. What d'you got?
I'm going to have a scotch and soda. - Make it two.
Where's the boyfriend all this time?
there isn't any boyfriend.
I told you that. - Isn't he kicking in?
you don't believe a thing I say, do you?
I'm just naturally what they call a cynic, honey.
what kind of a guy is he, anyway, shoving a nice kid like you out in front?
what's the use of my trying to tell you anything?
so all right.
if everything's so kosher, what are you giving me this dough for?
just because you like me?
I'm giving it to you because I don't want to be mixed up in this thing in any way.
not because I had anything to do with it. - Oh, indeed.
but because in my position, you can't tell what they'll try to hang on me.
how would you like to get out of this whole thing?
what do you mean? - Exactly what I'm saying.
get out of it, completely.
how?
go away with me.
think about it for a minute.
I don't have to think about it.
I'm not such a bad guy, you know.
I didn't say you were.
but what's more important, outside of this boyfriend that you haven't got,
I'm the only person in the whole world who knows you even knew Mazard.
think about it that way for a minute.
from Havana, it'll be a cinch to make South America.
and that's all there is to it.
if I thought... - If you thought what?
if you thought what?
have you any more money than that?
keep it. - Why?
take a look in the mirror, beautiful, and if you're thinking of somebody else, don't be a sucker.
in a jam like this, you've got to look out for yourself first.
I suppose so.
do you think he'd think of you if he had an out?
when would we leave? - The sooner the better.
tomorrow morning?
tonight would be better.
would it make a great deal of difference?
not if it's positive for tomorrow morning.
I'll have to do some phoning.
I can't have some people I know running around to the police and getting excited about a disappearance.
Yeah, you'll have to watch that.
I'll have to think of some kind of explanation.
is it a deal then?
I guess so.
I guess it is.
all right, give me a kiss.
you're not still worried, are you?
Oh, I suppose not.
you leave it to me, we'll do all right.
apparently, I'll have to.
I don't seem to have any other choice.
don't you want your drink?
I don't think so.
I'll put some more ice in it.
I suppose I could say I was going to the coast.
well, here we go.
do you really want me to drink this?
why not?
it's all settled, isn't it? - That's what I thought.
what do you mean? - You take it.
I've got mine. - You take this one, I'll take yours.
go ahead. What's the matter?
nothing. - All right, then.
drink it.
drink it.
what do you take me for, some kid? - I don't know what you mean.
and all this time I've been trying to give you a break, trying to get you out of this jam.
I've got a good mind to break your neck.
you're crazy. I don't know what you're talking about.
no, then why wouldn't you drink it?
now, let's have the rest of it.
there isn't anymore. - Will you stop acting like I'm a school kid?
get the rest of that dough and get it quick.
come on.
not under the mattress.
you amateurs.
what else you got here?
how could you lie to Pappy like that?
how did you think you could get away with it?
will you go now?
will you go? - Sure.
but first, because you've been such a smart little double-crosser,
I'm going to give you another little job to do.
I'm going to let you dig up some more dough for Pappy.
another five grand by tomorrow night.
how do you like that?
it's no use.
I can't do it.
I think you can.
you try anyway.
and I'll be around again tomorrow night, just to see what luck you have.
so long.
professor?
he's gone.
gone? How?
I see.
Yes.
I don't know, I'm not sure.
I haven't much more collateral.
I'm sorry.
but I don't know what else I could have done.
I was so scared.
I'm sure you did all you could.
we're just not very skillful at that sort of thing.
what can we do now?
I don't know, I haven't any idea.
I'm afraid I'm too tired to think about it anymore tonight.
too tired.
who's that? - It's Flinn, sir. I think he got him.
did you get him?
looks like it.
is that him? - Yes, sir.
some fellow saw him in this neighborhood last night, and I was patrolling along in the car when I spotted him back there.
so I called him to halt, and what does he do but start shooting.
let's take a look.
he's our man, all right.
did he come out of one of these houses? Did you see?
if he did, I didn't see him. He was just walking along when...
he's done a lot for himself, huh?
what I can't figure is what he started shooting for.
he just didn't like the idea of burning, I guess.
Mazard's.
that's very funny.
I was beginning to get an entirely different idea about this.
all right folks, break it up. Break it up.
it's all over, break it up!
operator, is Morning Side 5354 out of order?
I've been ringing it.
will you try it, please? Will you? It's very important.
it's 10: 30, Professor Wanley.
it's 10: 30, sir.
Oh, yes. Yes, thank you.
I fell asleep. - Are you all right, sir?
Oh, yes, quite.
good night, Collins. - Good night, sir.
my hat, please.
here you are, sir.
Charlie? - Yes, Professor.
I can't tell you how happy I am to see you alive and in such good health.
Oh, thank you, Professor.
taxi, Professor? - No.
no, thanks.
good night, Ted. - Good night, sir.
pardon me, will you give me a light?
no.
Oh, no. Thank you, indeed.
not for a million dollars!
each one anyone the but and
the world will have to deal with us.
jordan, you've done great things for the 4400, but you are on the wrong path here.
and you've always been rebellious, but I think you're afraid of change, shawn, or is it just me?
I think I'm shrinking. What did you do to me?
I met cora. She has an amazing ability. She can actually make people younger.
Isabelle? - D...!
if your mother were here, she'd want us to do this.
she'd want us to be a family again.
Mr. Tyler, when your wife fainted this morning, she was a young woman.
when she woke up less than a minute later, she was 50 years older?
Richard, I'm dying.
there's a faction of elites who want the future to stay exactly as it is.
I call them "the marked.
when we need him, he'll be there for uS.
Mr. Tyler, can you hear my voice?
Mr. Tyle mr. Tyler?
he's been under for almost 20 minutes.
we should have begun the procedure already.
where have you been?
who are you?
we're going to have to work fast.
this is our only chance.
I've practiced enough.
we have plenty of time.
tonight, richard tyler becomes a father.
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
just had a weird dream.
you want to talk about it?
no, I'm okay.
you should go back to bed.
I'll be right there.
here we go. Ready, and...
we're going to go higher, ready?
Ashland, oregon
D...loves you.
Oh, it's nice to see you happy, sweetheart.
D...'s been wanting that for a long time.
who are you?
who am I?
I'm lily. Your wife?
who else would I be?
you're not lily. Lily is dead.
dead? - You got old. You passed on.
no, you're wrong. I'M...
I'm right here. I didn't die.
then where have you been?
how did you get here?
well, I woke up about an hour ago.
I wasn't sure where I was, not exactly, but somehow knew you'd be home soon, and you'd have isabelle.
that's the last thing I remember. I was...
I was looking for her at the center, and she wasn't in her crib.
you look different, richard. You look sad.
you are not real.
you keep saying that, but I feel real.
I mean, I remember everything about my life, about us.
I can pick things up.
I can touch things.
you.
you can feel that, right?
I can't explain where I've been, richard, or how I got here, but...
I'm not questioning it, either.
I'm here. Isn't that enough?
can I ask you a question?
sure.
you're left-handed.
of course.
is there a question coming?
you already answered it.
I've been studying the reports on who survives the promicin shot and who doesn'T.
did you know nine out of ten left-handed people who take the shot survive?
no, I didn'T. - Well, it's true.
I learned that a couple weeks ago, but I didn't know what it meant.
until now.
there.
there's a small part of the brain called the corpus callosum.
it's like a bundle of wires that connects the two hemispheres.
it's usually slightly larger in lefties than it is in righties.
that's why the lefties survive.
the size of that part of the brain helps determine whether or not you'll be able to integrate a new neurotransmitter.
well, how big does it have to be?
I don't know.
okay. - Yet.
but I think I can figure it out, and if I do, a simple cat scan will tell me how anyone's body will react to the shot.
and you'd know in advance whether or not you'd live or die.
the shot wouldn't have to kill anyone anymore.
okay, how long do you need?
a couple of months, maybe less.
this is huge.
keep working. I'll get you anything you need, okay?
where are you going?
I got to get in contact with collier.
if this test is really only a few months away, all he has to do is make an announcement, telling people that are thinking about taking the shot to simply wait.
this is great.
Hey, tom.
what are you doing standing in the middle of the hallway?
is everything all right?
Yeah, I'm-I'm fine. I've just...
had a strange morning.
well, join the club.
we've just had a surprise visit from rebecca parrish.
some might say an ambush.
the director of national intelligence is here?
Yeah.
she's been in meghan's office the past 20 minutes, and that's not all.
she's asked to see us.
I don't think she likes to wait.
morning, agent baldwin.
agent skouris.
I'm rebecca parrish, and it is a pleasure to meet you.
Oh, the pleasure's all ours.
I know that you have difficult jobs here at ntac, but lately, it seems that we've had nothing but bad news coming out of seattle.
promicin use is growing.
the founding of promise city was a major defeat for this agency, and in the administration.
it's temporary.
we'll arrest collier, and we'll shut that place down.
I like your attitude, but you'll forgive me if I'm not reassured.
because recently, it seems like we're even botching the little things.
we had richard tyler and his daughter surrounded, outnumbered.
the situation was in hand, and we lost him anyway.
well, with all due respect, I was there, and that situation was anything but "in hand.
richard tyler has become an extremely powerful man.
I understand, but we can't simply just throw our hands up, now, can we?
in two weeks, I'm being asked to testify before a congressional subcommittee on the progress of the war against promicin.
I'll be here for the entire week to prepare, and I would like to go back with a victory.
so, you want us to bring in richard.
ms. Parrish asked to meet my two best agents.
that's why you're here.
that's also why you're heading up a task force to find the tylers.
I will be checking in on your progress.
I trust this won't be a problem.
agent baldwin?
did you have something you needed to say?
I'm...
sure tom just wants to get to work.
we'll, uh...find the tylers for you.
I don't know what's happening, diana.
it's like I'm seeing myself in the future, only it's not me.
I'm doing things I would never do.
what if they're not just dreams?
what if they're someone else's memories?
what if they really did put something inside me when I was in that hospital?
what if...what if it's starting to affect me?
I'm becoming one of the marked.
Oh, whoa, tom. Hey...
listen, even if you're right, it-it hasn't happened yet.
you're still you, okay? So we can fight it.
how?
well, have you been to see a doctor since these dreams began?
no.
okay, well, why don't you start there?
go find yourself a private physician, get yourself checked out.
we're supposed to be looking for richard.
just go. Go.
I'll cover for you.
go.
okay. - Okay.
she looks so much older.
how long have I been gone?
a little while.
more than a year.
tell me what happened. I want to hear it all.
why do you look so sad?
I buried you, lily. I mourned you.
I never imagined I'd be sitting beside you again, and I don't want to waste the time we have with explanations.
we have all the time in the world, though.
why wouldn't we?
you still don't believe I'm real, do you?
I don't know.
if I let myself believe it, and I turn out to be wrong...
I'm not sure I could live with that.
let's just see, okay?
we'll just lay here for a while, and if I'm still beside you when we wake up...
I guess we're real.
you saved these pictures of us.
of course I did.
who's this?
she's a friend of mine.
she lived at the 4400 center after you were gone.
she's pretty.
she looks nice, too.
I can see why you saved the picture.
I don't know.
there's nothing different about me, diana.
I had every test they could give me.
they all say I'm in perfect health.
I'll call you back.
what's going on?
sorry for the intrusion.
my security detail is nothing if not thorough.
they have to be.
the administration has enemies everywhere
what the hell are you doing here, ms. Parrish?
I wanted to have a word with you in private.
gentlemen...
gentlemen, agent baldwin and i need the room.
thank you.
damn it, this is my house
I'm going to pay you the respect of being frank.
I was a little concerned with your...
outburst in ms. Doyle's office this morning.
are you quite sure you're up to the job of tracking down richard tyler?
I'm fine.
that's good to hear.
this might surprise you, but I think I have an idea of what you're going through.
right after I took this job,
I felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown myself.
I was overwhelmed at work, and I was...
having these strange moments where I was seeing things.
it was almost like I wasn't myself, like someone else was in my head.
do you understand what I'm saying?
I think I do.
let me ask you something, ms. Parrish.
if I look behind your left ear, would I find a mark there?
a mark? You mean like a mole?
that's hard to say.
once you turn 40, your skin changes all the time.
I remember how nervous I was in those days.
I thought I was going to lose myself forever.
I fought it. My god, how I fought it, and then one day,
I just couldn't fight it anymore.
I gave in.
I accepted my situation, and you know what?
things have been much better for me since then.
I'm happier.
my friends tell me that I'm like a new person.
you should relax, tom.
whatever you're going through, just...
let it happen.
you'll feel better.
I promise.
you're saying rebecca parrish is one of these people? She's marked?
Yeah, I think so.
I mean, she never came out and said it.
but you haven't had any more hallucinations, right?
maybe she was talking about something else.
what do you think?
I think it's crazy, and I doubt we'll be able to prove any of this, but I have to go with tom.
I think that there's a very good chance the director of national intelligence is marked.
we're going to have to be very careful with how we proceed.
ntac would be looking for richard tyler no matter what, so we'll keep doing that.
I'm passing the case over to garrity and ashmore.
Tom, you're taking a personal day tomorrow.
Diana and i will keep an eye on you.
we'll watch over you in shifts.
I'm sorry, shawn, are you really asking me to tell people not to take promicin?
only for a few months.
jordan, I know that we have had our differences in the past, but this is good for both of us.
all we have to do is be patient.
it's not the need for patience that concerns me.
it's the worldwide implications of this test.
Sean, there would be millions of people with abilities and millions without any chance of having them.
Yes, but they would be alive.
and living in a world with two classes of human being.
positives and negatives cannot live side by side.
those without abilities will tear down the ones who have them, or the positives will simply use their powers to rid themselves of the negatives.
inquisition or holocaust.
either way, it's a recipe for hell on earth.
what's your alternative? You really want the entire world to take promicin?
Yes. Yes, I do. It's what I've always said has to happen.
half of the planet will die!
you're talking about mass suicide!
I am talking...
about a single generation of sacrifice, and at the end of it, a more fully-evolved species.
all of our failings as human beings will be addressed when we are all gifted.
I am not making any announcement.
and no one who cares about what's right for the world would.
somebody got so big!
Ooh, she got heavy, too.
Yeah.
just one, just one. - I'm going to go play.
all right, go play.
she seems so happy.
aren't toddlers supposed to be moody?
Oh, isabelle's had her moments, believe me.
Oh, I'm sure she has.
ever since I got back,
I've been thinking about what it must have been like for you, raising her on your own.
you know, neither of us asked to be parents, not that it makes it any less wonderful, but still...
it just kind of happened.
but you've always been there for her, even while I was gone.
you're a great father, richard.
you can tell just by looking at her.
I'm definitely using my ability on richard tyler.
he's seeing his dead wife, but I have no idea if they're talking about what he did to his daughter.
I just make him see her. Everything they talk about comes from him.
okay, keep at it.
we don't have any other options at this point.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
look, I know you're tired, but this is very important.
I won't forget what you did for me.
can I get a coffee or something?
Absolutely. Absolutely.
it's working.
we just need more time.
if you know where isabelle is, just tell me. I can help her myself.
didn't really work out so well the last time you tried it, did it?
it's too soon for that.
Richard's not ready to give her up yet.
this is just the first part of a plan to get her back.
when we're ready for the next part, I'll let you know.
or you can tell me now.
did you know he was involved with her grandmother?
why do you think we picked these two?
after we send them back to their time, they'll find each other.
they'll form a bond.
it's done.
she's pregnant.
honey...
honey, meghan.
honey, wake up.
I had the dream again.
of course you did, tom.
you're becoming your new self.
you're one of us now.
Wha...
welcome aboard.
did you have another dream?
no, I slept like a baby, actually.
I feel great.
forgot how much I hate it here.
there's so much noise in this time period. So many people.
I mean, look at them.
they have no idea what's coming.
they just move from pointless errand to pointless errand.
it's disgusting.
I'd think you'd be glad just to be alive.
you were given a chance to continue your work.
the work that failed so badly?
the work that got my previous host killed?
don't blame your shortcomings on matthew ross. We are our hosts.
your inability to harness isabelle tyler was your failure.
I'll do better this time.
you need to get back to work.
convince them to return you to active duty.
I'll pull some strings if I have to, but it's better if you got it done on your own.
and after I'm there?
that's the easy part.
do what tom baldwin would do.
find isabelle tyler.
I'll be in touch.
Richard, come play.
I can'T.
Lily, I have to tell you something.
what is it, sweetheart?
I lied to you.
that picture you saw.
the pretty girl.
that was isabelle.
my god, richard. I had no idea things had gotten so bad.
I don't expect you to forgive me, but I need you to understand.
I did it for our daughter.
why didn't you tell me the truth right away?
I've been happy, being with you the last few days.
you don't know how long it's been since I've felt that way.
a good father will do anything for his child, and you're a good father.
but, richard, you took away her life.
the good and the bad.
you erased everything she was, everything she could have been.
I knew I was wrong after I did it to her, but.
other people told me as much, but I didn't listen.
I guess the only person I could listen to was you.
d...
I feel real.
we're talking.
I've held isabelle.
no, you haven'T.
my ability makes it seem like you have.
I don't know if I'm seeing you because I want to, or if someone conjured you up for me.
I don't know, richard.
I don't know how I got here, but maybe it doesn't matter.
I don't think I'm going to be here much longer.
but if I have to go, will you just hold me?
I love you, richard.
I'm not saying we don't have to worry, but nothing happened last night, and this morning, tom said he felt fine.
well, he said he didn't want me to come over, but where is he?
because tom is always here at the crack of dawn.
Hey, what's up with tom?
he just dragged marco out of his office.
I think baldwin's gone nuts or something.
your mind is no match for the power of my mind.
you are now under my control.
my mind is no match for the power of your mind.
I am now under your control.
total control. - Total control.
you should see their faces.
sorry, we were just trying to ease the tension a little bit, that's all.
you idiots!
Marco, you're fired.
you too, garrity.
come on, that was classic!
you can't fire this.
go back to your office and solve something.
Oh, hey, come on... - quick.
I'm sorry.
good work.
no humor. No humor in this room.
what? Ah, you know what?
seriously, look,
I'd like to thank you both for helping me get through these past few days, but I had a great night's sleep.
I feel better, and, look, i really hope this is all over.
you know, if I have any more flashes, I'll tell you right away, but in the meantime, I'd really like to get back to work.
what about rebecca parrish?
I think we need to keep an eye on her.
her visit to my place was...
was definitely weird, but maybe you were right.
maybe the whole thing was her bizarre version of a pep talk.
look, whatever it is, I don't have to trust her to do my job, and I really want to do my job.
all right, but I'll be watching you, okay?
any more attempts at mind control, baldwin, and you're out.
okay.
wasn't funny.
I have a very simple message for anyone who's thinking about taking the shot.
wait.
in a few months, the research that I'm funding will be complete and 50-50 will be a thing of the past.
we will have a very simple test that can tell you whether or not you'll survive the shot, and no one ever has to risk dying again.
is jordan collier in favor of this?
you'd have to ask him that, paul, but we're talking about preventing thousands of needless deaths here.
I don't see how anyone could think that's a bad thing.
Kirkland, washington
you did this to your own child.
I'm disappointed in you, richard.
you told me you wanted to use that water I gave you to help an old army buddy.
I know it was wrong.
but you never would have gave me what I needed if you knew what I had in mind.
Oh, you're right about that.
these abilities we have, they are a gift from god, and we need to treat them with respect.
I know that, and that's why I'm here.
I'm hoping you can set things right.
Cora, please.
I need your help.
I'll see what I can do.
Byron, you gotta wake up. Byron...
Isabelle needs you, come on
let him sleep.
he did what he needed to do.
does that mean isabelle's okay?
not exactly, but we're getting close.
I need you to call your father.
call my father? Why?
you're going to have to tell him where isabelle is.
you want me to betray her to the government?
no.
if you know where she is, tell me. I'll go there myself.
this is how it has to be.
I promise you, kyle, if you do exactly what I say, isabelle will not wind up in jail.
think of everything we've done, kyle.
all that we've accomplished together.
are you really going to start doubting me now?
did it work?
d...?
are you going out?
Yeah.
Yeah, we had a tip on the tyler case.
someone called in from promise city, gave us the name and address of a 4400 that richard claimed he'd been in contact with.
it was anonymous, probably nothing.
you had the appointment at maia's school.
I figured I'd run it down while you were out.
well, I'm back, so I'll go with you. I'll just get my jacket.
okay, great.
did you see that?
the curtain just moved.
well, so someone knows we're here.
that tip of yours said this lady's just an associate of tyler's, right?
Yeah, but we'd better play it safe. Knock on the door.
I'm going to head around back, make sure no one tries to flee the scene.
Richard, a car just pulled up outside.
some people are coming.
Isabelle, get down to the basement.
if you hear any kind of struggle, run out the back, understand?
answer the door if they knock.
see if you can get rid of them.
Cora tomkins? Hi. I'm diana skouris. I'm from ntac.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about richard tyler.
I haven't seen him since quarantine.
do you mind if I come in?
so richard hasn't tried to get in touch with you at all?
no phone calls? No emails?
no, but I keep pretty much to myself. - Right.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was interrupting something.
you have company.
no, no, pardon my mess.
I'm not too good about cleaning up after myself.
like I say, I knew the man in quarantine, but I don't really keep in touch with many of the 4400s.
you people just don't quit.
don't move.
are you okay?
what have you done to them?
Diana! Diana...honey...
are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm sorry. I went around back, and isabelle was already halfway down the alley when I got out there.
I was going to chase her, but I came back when I heard the gunshot.
where is she now?
I don't know, diana. She got away.
good job, guys.
today, agent baldwin and agent skouris provided a textbook example of what we need to win this fight.
initiative, savvy, and exceptional teamwork.
the apprehension of richard tyler is a huge win for us, a reminder to everyone that the rule of law still prevails in this country.
make no mistake, there's lots more to be done, but today...
today we won.
nice speech.
Yeah, exactly what parrish would say if she were marked.
then again, it's exactly what parrish would say if she wasn't marked.
I know, either way, she won today.
nice work, you guys.
I gotta go make nice.
Hey, you...you gonna be okay?
Yeah.
sure?
we really got lucky today, just finding richard in that house.
it's a good thing you got that tip.
Yeah, well, it has to work out for us sometimes, doesn't it?
this is not how this was supposed to end!
richard is in prison! It's all over the news! Isabelle's on the run.
government's looking for her.
you said that she'd be okay. You lied to me!
I promised you she wouldn't end up in jail.
she's not in jail.
Yeah, and she's not safe, either.
this is not what I wanted
this isn't about what you want, kyle!
it's about what has to happen!
I'm not your sidekick.
I'm not here to run errands for you.
I'm here to tell you what the movement needs, and right now, it needs for you to be strong, because the next thing you have to do, trust me, it's not going to be easy for you.
what are you talking about?
your cousin shawn?
the work he's doing with that scientist is threatening the entire movement.
collier knows about it, but he's too afraid to get his hands dirty.
he shouldn't have to get his hands dirty.
that's what he has people like you for.
people like me?
what do you want me to do?
Shawn farrell has to be stopped.
don't worry. You're safe.
where am I?
you're at my house.
I gave you a tranquilizer, then I brought you here.
Where's my father?
we put him on the inhibitor.
he's in prison, and he's going to be there for a very long time.
he didn't do anything wrong.
he was just trying to help me
Isabelle, it's okay. It's okay.
there's a way to get him out. I...
I know people who could make it happen. It would be easy.
there's just one thing.
you...
have to take your abilities back.
then you're going to bring jordan collier to me.
with no memory of where they've been
they haven't aged a day
and some have returned with new abilities
all are trying to reconnect with a life interrupted
we're not a threat. We're salvation.
the world will have to deal with us.
okay, we're clear, right?
it's over between the two of us.
you once told me that good and evil was a choice, and I'm afraid if I lose you I'm going to make the wrong one.
welcome to Haspelcorp. How may I help you?
Hi. I have an appointment with Dennis Ryland.
learning anything new?
Yeah.
she's incredible.
in a week, we've made discoveries we thought it would take years to get to.
Isabelle, I don't love you.
Shawn, you and I are the two most powerful people on the planet.
we have to get married.
I knew she was different. Dangerous.
you can't kill me, Shawn.
Richard, if I believed that staying with Isabelle would save all those lives,
I would marry her tomorrow, but what happens if she gets tired of me, or I make her angry?
there are things I was sent here to do. Brutal things.
I don't know how you can know that, but it doesn't have to happen that way.
we need to be together, because I think you're the only one who can stop me.
looking for a date?
not you.
him.
Tim. You've got a customer.
so it's 40 bucks, if you want to get started.
I just want to look at you for a second.
do you have any idea how special you are?
you don't, do you?
look, we can talk if you want to, but it's still 40 bucks.
you're going to change the world.
how'd you know my name?
it's true.
you're going to change everything...
unless I stop you.
that's it. I'm out of here.
come on, man. Let me out. I'm serious.
I rolled that myself.
it's my way of saying thank you for inviting me to your wedding.
well, thank you, but you didn't have to.
Isabelle and I invited every 4400.
I wouldn't have missed it.
I'm quite excited. You must be, too.
the ceremony's so close.
four days.
I have to offer you a word of caution. The cigar...
when you smoke it, you might be surprised by its effects.
Oh, I'm not going to get arrested for having this, am I?
of course not.
about a year after we returned, I learned I have an ability.
when I come in contact with a person, they sometimes see a vision of their future.
I see nothing, understand-- only those I touch
but I'm told it can be quite accurate.
that's a nice talent.
thank you.
I grew this tobacco myself.
it's been in contact with my hands, and so it contains my ability.
wait, so, what you're saying is if I smoke this cigar,
I'm going to see the future?
your future. A possible one, anyway.
as I said, use with caution.
you might not like what you see, but it seems an appropriate gift for a man on his wedding day.
well, it is better than a toaster oven.
thank you, Claudio. - My congratulations to you.
the centerpieces are amazing. You should take a look.
uh, yeah, sure, after we're done with these meet-and-greets, though, okay?
Oh, you taking up smoking?
this is Edwin Garrett and his wife, Denise. They came all the way from Edinburgh to be here.
thank you so much for coming.
the guy's name was Tim Mccarren. He was a hustler.
worked an area of the park not far from here. I found his body just after sunrise.
now, I've already interviewed his colleagues, and they say he got into a pickup truck with a man in his 20s at about 1: 30 last night.
one of the other working boys got a real decent look at the driver.
so you could probably sit him down with a sketch artist.
probably could, but you do realize we're not homicide cops, right?
we're from ntac.
so why'd you call us?
that's why.
so long ago, another life
I can feel your heart beat it's not a dream remember us
I can see it in your eyes we'll find our place in time our place in time beyond the sun we'll find our place in time our place in time to call our own
my best guess? His body was completely oxidized.
it's a chemical reaction. Cells change at the molecular level.
Oxidizing? That's what happens when metal rusts.
exactly.
well, almost exactly. Rusting is a slow process.
there's nothing gradual about what happened to Tim Mccarren.
one minute he was alive, the next...
have you ever seen anything like this before?
no. There's no documented disease that affects the human body this way.
meaning a 4400 ability did this. - That's for you to figure out.
all I can tell you is there's no...
earthly explanation about what happened to this guy.
Thanks.
so nothing even close?
okay. Thanks, Brian.
that was the lab. They ran the composite sketch of the driver against our database of 4400s.
no matches. - Anything from forensics?
no. They pulled a couple of partial prints off the safety pin that held the note to the kid's jacket, but nothing we can make an I. D. From.
okay, what about the note? It's a deliberate message to whoever found the body.
that's typical of a serial killer pathology.
Yeah, but it says "27." There can't be 26 other corpses like Tim Mccarren's out there.
even one would make it onto our radar.
so we'll talk to Mccarren's friends, families... maybe he's got a connection to a 4400.
Diana... there is one other thing I want to talk to you about.
you got plans on Sunday?
y-you want me to go to Shawn's wedding... with you?
it's not a date, okay?
I figured you might be interested.
almost a thousand 4400s are coming.
Oh, so it's a professional courtesy.
Yeah, that's one way to put it.
look, to be honest, I'd rather not be the only one sitting at the ntac table.
you'd have a hard time finding a dance partner.
look, you know, Maia begged me to go, and I told her no.
all those 4400s in one place... we have no idea what could happen.
Diana, it's Shawn and iIabelle. Nobody's going to cause any trouble.
I mean, would you want to be on the bride's bad side?
I can't imagine you're eager to welcome that girl into the family.
I'm not
this all happened a little too quickly for my liking
but Shawn won't talk to me about it. I must have left him 20 messages.
I was thinking about going to see him after we finish work today.
just make sure Bridezilla is out of earshot.
I have to. - "Have to"?
you're about to get married, Shawn. You should want to.
what's going on? Is s? he... is she pregnant?
no, no, nothing like that.
is she forcing you?
look, Shawn, if you'reb feeling trapped, if you're looking for a way out of this, just tell me. I can help.
"help"? I'm not in front of a firing squad.
I'm getting married. People do it all the time.
come on, Shawn. You're marrying Isabelle.
she's a very dangerous girl. I happen to know that.
okay, I know all about her, too, so don't think you're going to surprise me.
I appreciate you coming down here, I know you mean well, but this marriage, it is the right thing.
the right thing for who?
for everybody.
they just cannot keep anything working around here.
this always happens when I work late.
you know, I don't even know where the stairs are in this place.
right down here. Come on. I'll show you.
so, do you always work past 8: 00?
most nights, yeah. Trying to get ahead, you know?
dedication. I like that.
you could accomplish great things.
her name was Paula Nakata. She was a lawyer at a firm in the building.
my god. The poor woman.
that's two bodies in less than 24 hours.
it doesn't make any sense.
most spree killers, they have a type, but Tim Mccarren and Paula Nakata could hardly be more different.
a prostitute and a corporate attorney. Why would someone target these two?
and why is she labeled "11"? The numbers on the bodies are working backwards.
it looks like we might have a partial print on the wedding band.
it's probably from the victim, but you never know.
let's hope whoever did this slipped up, because I don't think he's anywhere close to finished yet.
we were so close.
we were going to save everything.
Isabelle changed you.
you don't even... know who you are anymore.
she didn't change me.
she showed me who I am.
I know myself better than ever, and I know exactly what has to happen here.
don't do this.
did you go home last night?
Uh...no.
uh, I was working on your case. It got late.
cold. - We had a message you wanted to talk to us.
uh, yeah.
the print that they pulled from Paula Nakata's wedding band wasn't hers.
does it match the one we found on Tim Mccarren's body? - It does indeed.
the print belongs to a man named Darren Piersahl.
I never heard of him.
I'm not surprised. See...
he is not a 4400.
well, then he's not the murderer. Marco, you saw both bodies.
a 4400 killed these people.
it certainly looks that way, but the fingerprint match wasn't from our database.
it was from U. S. Military records.
Piersahl was an army ranger for seven years.
"was"? What's he doing now?
not much. According to army records, Darren Piersahl is dead.
he was killed in actio in Iraq in 2005.
I'm wondering...
how could an army sergeant who's supposedly been dead for a year be using a 4400 ability to kill people in present-day Seattle?
Darren always wanted to be a ranger.
it was his dream, ever since he was old enough to read.
I encouraged it. I spent 20 years in the service myself, so when darren signed up, it was like carrying on the family legacy.
why is ntac so interested in my son's death, anyway?
it's part of an ongoing investigation, Mr. Piersahl.
please, anything you could tell us would help.
not long before he died, I got a letter from darren.
he was excited.
said he'd been accepted into this elite training unit.
he couldn't tell me much about it, just that it meant he was being transferred off the front lines and out of harm's way.
and he was killed in action soon after that?
two weeks later.
the army told me he'd been flying a recon mission in an oh-58 helicopter.
it got hit with an rpg.
they never did find his remains.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Piersahl...
but you said the army "told you" he was flying a recon mission.
did you have any reason to doubt that?
well, I thought the timing was peculiar.
I mean, I just got this letter from him saying he was done fighting, so I did some checking.
there were six soldiers reported dead in the crash that killed my son.
and why is that unusual?
because an oh-58 flies with a crew of four.
it can't hold six people.
a secret training program? A death under suspicious circumstances?
there's something off here. Even the kid's dad knows it.
it's weird-- I'm not denying it
but let's just take our time with this, okay?
there are explanations that don't involve a cover-up.
someone could have planted Darren Piersahl's fingerprints at the crime scene.
who knows? It could be a 4400. Someone who can mimic other people's fingerprints.
maybe... But if you were trying to frame someone, why would you pick a dead man?
where?
we'll be right in. They just found another body.
I'll let you all in on a little family secret.
my brother and I haven't always seen eye to eye, so we didn't talk for a while.
I went to college, he became the most famous person in the world...
but it's all good, because he's a great guy, and I'm really proud of him.
I think we all are.
so... congratulations, man.
I couldn't be happier to see you walk the plank.
Congratulations. - Cheers.
is there anything you'd like to say, daddy?
toast. The father of the bride wants to speak.
