Kostov knew Rachel as a patient and as a client.
Kostov wasn't the victim's only plastic surgeon.
these are ten-times magnifications of the victim's jawbone surgery.
Kostov doesn't do work this sophisticated.
meaning she had more than one plastic surgeon.
I live to serve.
Zack, this facial surgery
the edges of the bone are almost scalloped, as if the blade simultaneously cut and applied torsion.
you need to know if this procedure is recognized and sanctioned by the American Medical Association.
you think Kostov is performing illegal surgical procedures?
it won't help us to discover the identity of our victim, but it might help us catch her killer.
that's the point, Bones.
what? - To catch the murderer.
I'm sending you a catalogue of all the stuff they sent me.
soil samples, pollen, particulates, etc. That were on the body parts.
nothing too surprising except for e-glass fibers.
she didn't pick that up in a field.
no, it's marine fiberglass.
the victim was on a boat shortly before she died.
also, look at this.
a fingernail-- probably her own.
I sent it to the FBI crime lab so they could run DNA tests.
that's zirconium, by the way, not a diamond, so I'm guessing she wasn't your top-drawer, high-class prostitute.
all the osteological perturbations are consistent with recent elective surgeries, except for compound fractures in the right tibia and fibula, which indicate traumatic compression ante-adrenarche.
the victim had her leg crushed.
probably in a car accident around age 13...
excuse me, that's my cell phone!
I analyzed the molars.
oxygen and strontium isotopes in the enamel indicate early childhood in new England, while the dentin suggests six to ten years in southern California.
Hey, Ms. Bardu, hi. Special agent Booth. I reconsidered your offer.
I was wondering if I could have one of your ladies visit me today.
you're ordering a prostitute from my cell phone?
I was wondering if Rachel ever took part in any of those two-on-one specials.
Hey, the old two-on-one special-- classic.
what's a classic? - That's great.
just send me whoever she worked this the most.
you're ordering a hooker to my hotel?
did I hear you say hooker?
how come I never get to go on these out-of-town trips?
cause you have much looser daily allowances than I do.
well, have fun.
I have to get up early tomorrow. - Why?
I'm meeting the producer.
Oh, you're one of those guys.
what guys?
one of those guys who say they just want to talk.
I do just want to talk.
I'm an FBI agent.
okay, I get the drill.
what am I playing?
no, really, Leslie, I...
I really am an FBI agent.
I just want to ask you some questions, that's all.
about what? - About your friend Rachel.
look, I'm sorry, but I think...
I think she's been murdered.
this can't be happening
Oh, god.
Rachel was so nice.
she was really an actress.
you know, the way I'm really a singer.
we all say we're something different than what we are.
none of us want to be what we are.
you know Rachel's real name?
but I doubt that was her real name.
she said she was from Stockton, but I told her I was from Coeur d'Alene, and I was lying, so...
do you know why anyone would want Candice dead?
we see things we shouldn't all the time.
we know things about powerful people they don't want us to know.
Candice have anyone in her life?
for a while.
I forget his last name, but he played some kind of terrorist on 24.
he got killed in like four seconds.
Nick know that Candice was a call girl?
no. Not at first
and when he found out he was really mad.
he smashed out all the windows of her car.
I'm sorry, miss, but you're gonna have to leave.
listen, buddy, I don't know what your problem is, but this is my little sister, okay? I'm visiting from c'Oeur d'Alene, and I asked her here for a drink which is taking a hell of a long time, by the way.
I'm sorry, sir, but we have strict rules...
you might want to have a little respect.
and check on those drinks for us, okay, pal?
Yes, sir. - Thank you.
thank you.
so...
we're just gonna sit here and have a drink?
that's all?
that's all, Leslie.
have a drink, enjoy the view and, hopefully, catch us a killer.
agent Booth, can I have a moment, please?
have I done something to offend you?
look, I'm not really into this whole west coast in touch with your feelings thing, okay? So...
Yeah. Um...
I'm really good at my job and I've been nothing but cooperative and helpful to you, but you just freeze me out.
Mm-hmm.
and I know you have nothing against working with women because you're partners with Dr. Brennan, so...
your problem must be with me.
look, I don't have anything against you, agent Finn.
I just don't like the way you view the FBI.
what do you mean?
this is a proud and noble job, but you're using it to get to something else.
my advice:
write you script, get an agent
hell, have a little plastic surgery
but quit using my federal bureau of investigation as a stepping-stone into something that you think is better.
because in my book, there is nothing better.
I'm here with Penny Marshall, one of the most prolific hyphenates in Hollywood, actress, producer and director of such hits as a league of their own and big.
her latest project is "Bred in the bone."
it's a thriller based on the novel by crime fighting anthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan.
okay. So, how did this all come together?
I have no idea.
well, my brother Gary gave me the book and I liked it, and then this whole bidding war started, and I don't usually get into that kind of thing, but in this case...
a bidding war?
that's got to be a thrill for a first-time author.
I wasn't actually there.
you must be a big fan of Penny's films.
so, which one's your favorite?
well, I enjoyed her humorous treatment of the time-space paradox.
big!
Yeah. Very funny.
time-space paradox.
penny, who is going to write the script?
don't...
I get to do that?
we'll talk.
cut. Stop.
whatever you say.
well, I want to come with you.
I have to go 'cause we have a suspect and... I have to go.
would you look at that passion.
pretty good chance that one of these leaping loses is our killer.
you always think it's a boyfriend.
well, he loved her, found out that she was a prostitute.
I'd say anyone who plays this stupid game is capable of murder.
well, then, you got this case sewed up,
why don't you just go and arrest them all?
excuse me, guys.
ladies.
ladies, gentlemen. Excuse me. Please.
Hey, everyone who isn't Nick Harbison go get the ball.
God, she was so sweet.
I actually thought about getting back together with her, even though...
... you broke all the windows in her car?
well, what would you do if you found out your girlfriend was a prostitute?
when did you last see Rachel?
her name was Sandra Kane, at least as far as I knew.
when did you last see Sandra?
about a month ago.
I was tending bar at a function at the colony.
did you speak to her?
no.
no, I was working.
so was he.
I didn't kill her.
how could you not know what she was doing for money?
did you even know her at all?
she said she was modeling. The thing about Sandra is that, and as pretty as she was, she was just never pretty enough.
she'd be all black and blue, and then she would heal and she would look beautiful.
I mean really, really beautiful, and we'd be sure that something was gonna break for her, and, of course, it couldn't.
and then she would be back in front of that mirror, and no matter what I said...
look, look.
I-I never knew her, I never understood her.
I'm probably the last guy you should be asking about her.
he's an actor. Of course he's convincing.
I don't know. Doesn't seem to work very much.
he's playing volleyball in the middle of the day.
just an observation.
I have an announcement.
you are unable to positively authenticate the skeleton.
that is correct.
told you.
given the inconsistencies between the specimen's geographic location, physiognomy and artifacts,
I cannot in good faith authenticate the find.
is this because of how I made him look?
cause there's a certain amount of subjectivity involved in recreating a face.
a certain amount, yes, but, the fact is, he displays Pictish features.
for all we know, this skull doesn't belong to this body.
even though on X-rays it looks as though the head is properly attached to the spinal cord, we could actually go in and look, confirm the authenticity.
I decline to continue the investigation at this time.
we will store the remains in the interim.
I knew this was gonna happen.
because we have been colleagues on this, more than superior and subordinate, I've allowed you to be insubordinate, but I warn you, Dr. Hodgins, that is over.
do you want my letter of resignation?
you know what would be better?
put them on the table and measure. Right?
okay, look, everybody just turn and walk away.
if you want me to resign, just say so.
ms. Montenegro is right.
you think you just won something.
I'm telling you, Goodman was the bigger man.
isn't it against your ethical code to have sexual relations with a patient, or do you guys even have an ethical code?
sex with patients is frowned upon.
that's why he said the implants were stolen.
no way to prove that he was the one who installed them.
I did not know Rachel was dead when you last visited, and I did not kill Rachel.
I made her beautiful.
you mean you took what was unique and particular about her and destroyed it.
you have a serious neurosis on the subject.
do you have a boat?
I do four boob jobs a day, 20 grand a pop.
of course I have a boat.
that's all you get without a lawyer.
so what do you do, huh? Pay him in hair plugs?
still working on the murder weapon?
if it's not a knife, maybe it's some kind of sharpened screwdriver.
why are you being so mean to Dr. Goodman?
I'm not being mean. I'm being critical of his process.
why are you being so critical of his process?
Goodman should be looking at the facts.
is this skeleton authentic or not? That's all.
instead, it's all a mishmash of conjecture.
what I think is he's forgotten how to do the science and doesn't want to admit it.
why a screwdriver?
because there's more torsion in the cut than a flat-bladed knife could bear without snapping.
it twists without breaking.
the killer would have to be incredibly strong, and even then, the blade would snap.
that's what Brennan said about the jaw surgery thing.
what? - I don't know.
I do bugs and silt, but she said the words "torsion" and "twist" and "cut.
this is the type of situation where people say, "oh, my god."
pretend you're a person and say it.
Oh, my god.
scenario number one:
prostitute gets breast augmentation from plastic surgeon in return for sex.
she threatens to tell on him. - Plausible.
scenario number two. Jealous boyfriend. Well, yada yada.
you know the rest.
which do you like? - Neither.
because there's no real evidence.
unless you count a volleyball.
it sounds like you're getting ready to quit.
quit? No.
the deputy director wants me to hand the case over to L. A. Field office.
we supposed to give agent Finn what we got and... go home.
what? Forget it.
you don't even like agent Finn. You think she's an idiot.
bones, the whole case is a bust, it's a blank.
we-we don't have anything. We checked her apartment. Nothing.
there are no pictures, nothing.
we don't know what she looks like. We don't know her name...
it's like she lived on the world instead of in it.
Cullen is calling you back because he thinks I'm at a dead end. You...
you have to tell him he's wrong.
is he wrong?
we know we're looking for someone who grew up in new England, moved here about eight years ago.
her leg was crushed in a car accident when she was 13.
she was on a boat shortly before she was murdered.
we know some of her names and some of her faces.
that's all your stuff.
usually, by now, we know more about my stuff.
we have separate stuff?
Yeah. By now, I usually have a feel for the person.
what they wanted, how they felt...
what was going on in their lives-- with this girl, nothing.
she thought she was ugly.
she did everything she could to make herself beautiful, and all she did was make herself more invisible.
everybody in this city thinks they're ugly, and nobody is.
I'm starting to get why you have anonymous death so much.
we're born unique.
our experiences mold and change us.
we become someone, all of us, and to have that taken away by murder, to be erased from existence against our will, it's just...
evil? - Unacceptable.
these bones you bring me
I give them a face, I say their names out loud,
I return them to their loved ones, and you arrest the bad guy.
I like that.
so do I.
I feel like we should be arresting these...
doctors, because whether they killed her or not, they...
they still erased her.
well, maybe I could hold Cullen off for a day.
that's not good enough.
you're welcome.
the murder weapon is a larger version of the surgical implement used on the victim's jaw.
you compared the wounds to the marks left on her jaw?
that's brilliant, Zack.
it was Hodgins-- well, Hodgins quoting you, so...
it was us. Go team.
but get this.
according to the national plastic surgery association, there's only one surgeon who does this procedure.
tell me he's in L. A.
he's in L. A.
okay, Dr. Henry Atlas Rodeo drive, Beverly hills.
go.
Hically bound to ask you for a warrant before revealing the identity of any of my patients.
let me try this then.
the job procedure which Dr. Brennan described to you was my innovation, yes.
there's an adage in my business:
you can't alter the bone.
I've proven it incorrect, given the right patients.
how many have you done?
perhaps half a dozen.
and if you get a warrant,
I will release the names of my patients; otherwise...
do you use special operating instruments?
yes; I designed them myself, specially for the procedure.
have you patented them, or shared the design with anyone?
not yet.
he's waiting till he has enough success stories to cash in.
he's going to be short one success story.
that's right. Let's see what we got here:
any of these women-- they ring a bell?
as I have reiterated...
I have a search warrant here to collect your surgical instruments.
you'll... you'll shut me down.
you will cost me a fortune.
the only ones we require, Dr. Atlas, are the ones you've designed yourself.
she told me her name was Susan Shepherd.
brilliant.
you wanted to see me?
you are a very difficult and stubborn man, Dr. Hodgins.
right now, I'd like nothing more than to fire you.
in my position, very few people...
tell me the truth anymore.
I find I enjoy it...
in some... perverse way.
you willing to admit you bailed on the authentication?
Yes.
Seriously?
but not for the reasons you think.
true, we might be able to authenticate the skeleton by taking him apart, destroying him.
if he's a fake, that would be fine, nothing lost. But I think...
he's the real thing.
you do know he's been dead for 1, 500 years, right?
I am an archaeologist.
this is what we do.
we step outside the facts and tell ourselves the story of an individual or a culture.
and if the story I tell myself about this man who lived 1, 500 years ago is true, if he was laid to rest by people who respect and loved him...
don't I owe it to them not to let the pure scientist desecrate his remains?
or...
you could be totally rational and say you were waiting for imaging technology to improve to the point where it wasn't necessary to disassemble him.
Ah...
Yes.
I suppose I could say that; it's less, uh... sentimental.
for the pure scientists.
I've got the murder weapon.
we have the murder weapon.
we have trace evidence from your boat.
we have testimony from your staff that you argued with a woman you knew as Susan Shepherd, shortly before she died.
so what you need now is a confession.
your patient list is what's known as, uh, "a-list," right?
Oscar winners, supermodels, super-agents...
moguls.
so how is it that a call girl makes the grade?
you can answer that, Henry.
I did Susan's procedure pro Bono.
Why?
because she volunteered.
she was a guinea pig.
how'd you meet her?
Aw, come on.
Susan didn't just walk into your office, did she?
Oh, just tell them, Henry.
through another call girl-- one I used regularly.
sometimes, these girls from the high-class establishments start to have expectations beyond the professional.
she thought you were gonna marry her?
something along those lines, yes.
so I made a change. I started requesting Susan.
did you trade plastic surgery for sexual favors?
obfuscate, Henry.
we did each other favors.
went fine for a few months.
until Susan wanted you to marry her, too.
no. In my opinion, Susan had become addicted to plastic surgery.
I refused to do any more procedures.
that's what my staff heard us arguing about.
what was Susan like?
she was the girl next door.
simple, healthy...
the girl before Susan was the opposite. She was very flashy.
she had diamonds in her incisors, diamonds in her fingernails.
bones, didn't Hodgins find a fingernail?
Yes, with a fake diamond in it.
but Susan was the girl-next-door type.
it wasn't her fingernail.
jealousy. Like I said.
so, what was the name of the escort before Susan?
the flashy one, the one who thought you were gonna marry her?
tell the man what he needs to know, Henry.
she thought Atlas was gonna take her out of the life.
he wanted the girl next door.
you were right:
jealousy.
Ah, it's an old story.
bet your 1, 500-year-old friend back home heard a version.
when she thought Rachel was stealing her man
she killed her
what did she ask you?
what?
she asked you something after she was arrested-- what was it?
she asked me...
if I thought she was beautiful.
I got one more thing: I had the bureau search for adolescent girls that were injured in car crashes in the upper northeast, ten to 12 years ago.
daughter's right leg was crushed.
her name was Alison Holmes.
her father and her brother are still alive somewhere in Bangor, Maine.
we'll return the remains.
Thanks, Booth.
well, Bones...
you do your thing,
I do mine.
look at her.
Yeah;
pretty little thing.
insect activity...
volatile fatty acid levels in the soil, due to putrefaction...
suggests she was buried for approximately six months.
typically, gravediggers are necrophiliacs looking for a little action.
dental exam shows shoveled incisors and striated enamel.
Indicating? - Malnutrition.
which is consistent with anthropometrics, suggesting the victim is from Central America.
the body was found in a Salvadoran neighborhood.
in Pikeville, Tennessee, a guy dug up the graves of all these people, because he wanted to make sure their bodies were still there.
they weren't. - Make a sketch of the face.
I'm not sure if we'll find a match. She might have been undocumented.
Goodman is an expert in religious iconography.
maybe he'll be able to determine where this rosary was made.
depression fracture on her occipital bone straddling the left lambdoidal suture.
looks like one hard hit congruent with, say, a baseball bat.
she was religious.
she should have had a casket...
a proper burial with her name on a headstone.
we are going to find out who she is and we are going to give her that.
warlord of the Venganza Roja street gang.
according to this, you... you are one fierce, fierce guy.
well, it didn't stop your guys from picking me up.
they tell you why?
someone took a shot at some Mara Muerte espuma. - Not a shot, hmm?
a couple dozen shots. A drive-by.
hardly anyone is stupid enough to shoot at those guys anymore.
your name came up. - It wasn't my people.
so, are you gonna charge me with something or let me go?
extortion, drugs, assault, attempted murder.
I could hold you for a while, if you want to play that game.
what's your problem, man?
what's my problem? My problem is that somebody shot at me.
shot at me and my partner. Plus, you know, a bad guy got away, so I'm a little cranky about the whole thing.
I don't really scare that way, you know, the whole in your face staring thing?
no? - No.
give me a chance, man. I'm just getting started.
so, somebody shot at you, huh? - That's right.
think about it.
when was the last time you heard of a drive-by where no one got hit?
innocent bystanders, mostly.
it's not like you always hit what you aim at.
think, just for a couple of seconds, about why the guy never got hit.
Ah, yeah, you see? You got it now?
you're saying that Mara Muerte did a drive-by on their own guy?
a drive-by happens, yeah.
and you all hit the deck.
and the gangbanger makes a run for it.
okay, I have it on good authority that the guys who shot at our killer were doing it so that he'd have a chance to escape.
the victim was pregnant when she was hit over the head.
pregnant? - Yeah, five weeks along.
get your hands off there.
I ran samples from the body, shovel and burlap through the gas chromatograph, and it all came back full of organic compounds: Plant detritus, root remnants, fertilizer.
sounds like stuff you'd find in a cemetery. - Yeah, well, I also found this.
Fernaldia pandurata, otherwise known as loroco buds.
loroco is an edible flowering plant. It's native to El Salvador.
it's grown in vegetable gardens, not cemeteries.
she was buried in a vegetable garden?
okay, can you recognize this loco plant?
Loroco. I've eaten it, but i wouldn't recognize the plant.
it's quite distinctive.
I'm also analyzing the dirt and particulates on the shoe you got off the suspect.
at first glance, it matches the egetation we've already found, but with a couple extras i'm still checking out.
okay. Hodgins, suit up. You're coming with us.
we're going to the barrio. - Field work. Cool.
do I get a gun? - You can't arm Hodgins and not me.
what is it with you people and the guns? Huh?
look at this.
the government bankrupts itself giving tax breaks to the rich so there's no money left to help these people with job training, educational resources, health care.
just look for a garden with the plant.
and those who do manage to land a job are working for a minimum wage - that hasn't seen a hike in eight years. - That's for those who are here legally.
the undocumented do a lot worse. - What is this? NPR radio, huh?
what, are you two running for office?
look, over there.
it's the same approximate maturity that would have yielded the buds we found.
adipocere.
it forms on the body in response to moisture on the ground.
Trogid beetles.
they have a thing for decomposing flesh.
I found a couple on the burlap.
the rest of the rosary.
there's another freshly-overturned pile of dirt over here.
more adipocere. - Not from the same body?
another body was buried here, but it's gone now.
double homicide.
I spoke to the city development office.
the garden is scheduled to be excavated next week for construction.
my guess is we interrupted a gangbanger moving the body of two murder victims.
a gangbanger who buries his victim with a rosary?
what? You find any gunshot wounds? - Nope, just head trauma.
you really like this part, don't you?
I like answers, yes.
Oh, localized staining on the endocranial surface, indicating...
subdural hematoma.
the head wound caused internal bleeding, but death was not instantaneous.
she may have been conscious for some time after the assault.
but there's no sign of bone remodeling. She died soon after the assault.
there's patterning on the ectocranial surface.
whatever weapon was used, it left a mark.
our gang unit's gonna bring in the leader of marauerte, see if we can identify the gangbanger who got away.
why would a gang leader cooperate?
cause I'm gonna ask him very, very nicely, bones.
you know that book i'm reading about getting along with your coworkers?
it says that sarcasm is never helpful.
I could lend it to you, if you want. - I found spodoptera ornithogalli and tetranychus urticae on the suspect's shoe and on the victim.
I also found notonectidae and corixidae.
it's aquatic fauna typically only found in and around ponds and streams.
there are no ponds or streams at the burial site.
Yeah, and here's the kicker: There was also evidence of genetic material from a franklinia alatamaha on his shoe.
you're kidding? - I'm in shock. Franky alabama? You don't say.
did you hear what I said about sarcasm?
it's a rare flowering plant that hasn't been seen in the wild since 1800.
the only known specimen in this area- outside a specialized botanical garden
was given to senator Alan Corman as a gift.
Oh, I love going after senators.
whoa, just, you know, simmer down here, Hodgins, okay? We're gonna check out the botanical garden first.
fine.
it's at the White House.
okay, you guys should do that even less than normal people.
make sure to keep your eyes open for backswimmers and water boatmen while you're there, and remember, the notonectidae can be different colors.
you know... - that's a nice try, okay? You're coming with us.
I call shotgun.
I called "shotgun."
what does it mean to a society when the niceties are no longer observed?
okay, look, we got two bodies, all right?
one unaccounted for. We've been shot at, and now we know that there's a gang member walking around a U.S. Senator's place.
any theories?
Oh, come on, guys. Let's think of it as a puzzle - and there's a missing piece. - I like puzzles.
I find them relaxing. I just finished the anatomy lesson. Rembrandt.
you're kidding, right?
what do you find relaxing?
I restore vintage cars.
I know what I find relaxing.
everybody finds what you find relaxing, relaxing.
senator Corman is a big supporter of business leaders in Central America.
that means supporting repressive regimes that use death squads to silence any opposition from the working people, which are the same people who flee to the states.
okay, that's great, that's good. Okay, let's focus. It's good, 'cause now we have a link between Corman and the Salvadorans.
now you think the senator murdered two people?
I just think we got another piece of the puzzle, that's all.
because of my husband's official work in El Salvador we've formed a bond with the country and the people.
in fact, we have several Salvadoran immigrants working here at the house.
I've actually sponsored quite a few for citizenship.
citizenship screening would keep out members of death squads.
just because i'm anti-socialist doesn't make me pro-death squad.
Dr. Brennan has found evidence that a gang member's been on your property recently.
well, we employ 20 staff members, give or take.
all of our staff members are either legal aliens or citizens.
our house manager is in charge of hiring them and managing them.
do you recognize this man?
no.
I assume he did something worse than trespass on my property?
house manager... is he from El Salvador?
Yes.
agent, you didn't answer my question.
we're investigating a death, senator Corman. You understand why I can't talk about it.
perhaps we could show this picture to your house manager?
of course.
franklinia alatamaha. It's beautiful.
Yes. We're the only people cultivating it privately.
senator, do you have a pond on the property?
Yes, on the other side of the shrubs. It's small.
could Dr. Hodgins take a look at it? - Of course, be my guest.
Logan, come say hello. We have guests.
it's our son. He's studying landscape architecture at Georgetown.
he likes to supervise the men sometimes.
Logan, this is special agent Booth from the FBI and his associate Dr. Brennan.
what's the FBI doing here?
they would like to ask Hector some questions.
Yeah.
Yes, sir?
Hector, I'm special agent Booth. Do you recognize this guy?
no, I don't think so.
it could be Jos?
he works here sometimes, as a gardener.
Really?
I don't think so.
Jos? Who? - Jos，Vargas.
Logan, agent Booth said he was in a gang.
a gang? No, no way.
jos is a nice guy, you know, wife and kid.
I found both backswimmers and water boatmen.
what is it?
looks like we found the second body.
Puparial casings of tineid moths puts the time of death of this one at about a year.
six months before the girl.
heart-shaped pelvic inlet. Long projections of bone into the rib cartilage suggests we have a male over 60.
Anthropometrics suggests Hispanic origins.
we reassembled the rosary found on the young woman.
the carving of fire in the center piece is an archetypal symbol found in an area of El Salvador since the Chaparrastique volcano erupted in 1787.
so this might indicate where the female victim's from.
a village called Milagro de la Paz in the southeast of the country.
I was there three years ago, identifying victims of the death squads.
I finished the sketch of the woman.
she was pregnant, starting over in a new country, so I gave her a smile, made her look hopeful.
Thanks, Angela.
all right, let's clean the bones so we can find a cause of death.
I think I just found it.
it's a bullet.
looks like steel core, copper jacket.
military issue.
those are the kinds of weapons gangs like.
they escape from the death squads and wind up being killed by the same weapons they were running from.
I got Jos's address from Logan.
let's check it out.
FBI. Make your presence known.
look, he has a family, a baby.
is anybody here?
you don't have to be afraid.
of course, they're gonna be afraid, Bones. I have a gun.
that's where the victims are from.
they had to have been here a few minutes ago-the bottle's still warm.
they're still here. - How do you know?
they're prepared for this kind of thing.
hiding from death squads, people learned to build false walls.
closet. Okay, hold on, Bones.
let's just pretend that I'm the cop for a second. Okay?
What'd you say?
that we just want to talk to Jos?
that they'd all be safe, they have nothing to worry about.
do you want to be deported? Do you want to see your baby again?
because if he was born here, he doesn't have to go back with you.
we can keep him. - Booth. Stop. She's frightened enough.
bones, we have a double murder on our hands.
but she didn't do it.
just tell her what I said, okay? Tell her we're calling immigration.
tell her we'll get to Jos?
no, she's lived with terror and intimidation her whole life.
I'm not going to add to it. - All right, you know what?
you're acting like I'm gonna hurt her or something.
I'm just trying to get information.
I am asking you, as a favor, not to make me do this to scare her.
please.
this is interesting. - Interesting or horrible?
because sometimes it's the same thing with you.
this hole in the sternum. It's definitely not a gunshot wound.
it's a sternal foramen.
I found the same exact thing on the female victim's sternum.
it seemed like a meaningless anomaly... - It's a hereditary condition.
the two victims were related.
based on their ages... father and daughter?
so father and daughter buried next to each other, right?
then dug up.
but then father is reburied.
Why? - The gangbanger was probably taking the daughter to be reburied when the cops pulled him over.
this is the stuff that booth is good at. The murky ways of the human heart, all that.
we work the hard evidence. - We used up all the evidence.
okay, okay, let's just... you know what?
let's just pretend we're Booth, okay? - Ooh, let me try.
the daughter got pregnant from the killer in El Salvador, then came here.
he catches up to 'em, they fight...
he joins a gang and then kills her.
the father comes after him seeking revenge, and the killer kills him.
no, no. The father's death preceded the daughter's by at least six months.
I have found something.
I can't get this bullet out of the pelvic bone.
the bone started healing around the bullet. See the remodeling?
th wound healed years ago.
he didn't die by being shot. - Tough old bastard.
how was he murdered?
he wasn't murdered.
metastatic carcinoma.
probably originating in the prostate.
so, he survives being shot, but then he dies of cancer?
Mega-tough old bastard.
Yeah.
anything? - Yeah.
immigration has the wife.
she got a lawyefrom the Salvadoran league of something-or-other and she's not giving us anything about jos?
are you mad at me? - No.
but, you know, I could have gotten something back there if you hadn't gotten...
all mushy on me. - I was uncomfortable with...you always say I'm not a cop.
you're right.
especially in a situation like that.
it's okay. We're not going to need her anyway.
Really? Why?
cause I had the gang unit put a lean on Roberto Ortez.
he's the head of Mara Muerte.
the gang that Jos belongs to? - Yeah.
they convinced Ortez to bring Jos in for questioning.
why would he do that?
Ortez's sister is in the can on possession charges.
I... I promised him I could make that go away.
can you? - I don't know, it's a local beef I'm federal, but, hey, I'm a cop, and, uh...
thank god for bad sisters, huh?
he has a collapsed lung, several broken ribs, one arm is broken, the other shoulder's dislocated.
but we can talk to him? - You can try.
wow, your own guys, they do this to you?
Hey, geez, I wish I had my own gang.
I don't belong to no gang.
I'm a gardener. - Oh, a gardener with a Mara Muerte tattoo on his neck who can now understand english and who likes to plant bodies.
Hey, maybe that stuff's private. - Hey, you know what?
you're an illegal immigrant. You're a gang member.
you're under arrest for transporting a dead body in a stolen car, and you're under suspicion for murder. I'm gonna call ICE.
and have you and your wife deported back to El Salvador.
I got a son. - Forget it. We keep the son.
that's my son.
it's my only son.
you got kids? - No.
Yes, you do. - Difference is, I'm a fit father.
I'm not going around murdering guys and...and little girls, burying them, digging them up...
I don't think he murdered those people.
you can tell if he murdered someone by looking at his X-rays.
he has the same genetic condition the two victims had.
a sternal foramen.
they were probably his sister and his father.
that true?
Hey, you know what, buddy, you want to be on my good side, because I wasn't joking about keeping your kid.
Yes.
it's my sister, it was my father.
your father died of natural causes. Fine, but...
your sister was murdered.
eh, you know what? Forget it.
gang is the only family Jose cares about, you know?
enjoy your trip back home, and have fun explaining to your wife why she doesn't have a baby in her arms.
give us something.
help us to do the right thing for your sister.
I cannot.
just... anything.
at least you could tell us their names.
you want their names, huh?
was our family name.
Maria was my sister; our father was named Augustin.
Jose's sister hated him.
hated him? Why? - She didn't approve of his associations.
you mean associations, like the leader of one of the most murderous street gangs in the country?
if she hated Jose so much, why was he moving her body?
the burial site was threatened. He wanted to move her to a better place.
and his father.
real family guy, you know?
I'm not the leader of the whole gang, just the dc chapter.
you shot at us so Jose could have a chance to get away.
Mara Muerte takes care of its own.
even a throwaway like Jose. - Can I ask you something?
Yeah, go ahead.
Jose's all beaten up, so he won't tell us anything, but you, you don't even ask for a lawyer, but you hardly stop talking.
bones... - Hey, I'm the boss, lady, okay?
Jose's a subordinado.
that retraso not as smart as me. - You intimidate him into silence, but you can walk in here to the FBI, say whatever you want and walk away like you own the place.
that's right.
look, all I need to know is, who would have the guts to kill his sister.
who cares, man?
come on, Ortez, a sister of the mara muerte. It's the most feared gang in the city.
she wasn't my sister, man.
it had to be somebody else in the gang, somebody more important than Jose.
you know what, lady?
you think too much.
maybe you need a man like me to get your mind off of things, you know what I'm saying?
I can be your adorin' Salvadoran.
look, I didn't know who killed Jose's sister.
but I'll tell you what, because I like you so much,
I find out who did it, I'll kill him.
you been waiting for me?
push that button again, and we can go down together.
you think you can intimidate people into doing what you want?
okay, I'll push it myself.
how do you handle someone who isn't afraid of you?
just get out of my way.
I said, move your ass.
I wouldn't...
that's gonna hurt in the morning.
feel better? - Yeah.
you beat up a gang leader?
booth told you that? - You did.
you got into a fight with a gangbanger.
you're mad at me? - The guy's a killer, Brennan.
Angela, relax. We were in the FBI building.
look, I know you're all about self-reliance and fighting your own battles and standing up for yourself, but now, as your friend, and knowing how much you hate psychology here...
you need therapy.
I'm sorry I upset you.
it's just that I've dealt with him before.
with who? - People who get what they want through fear.
gangbangers, members of death squads... - I know it's psychology again, but you said "him," like, one guy.
I didn't mean Ortez specifically I meant... people like him.
on my last trip to El Salvador... - Yeah, I remember
I tried to get you to go to Italy with me.
I was in a tent set up by one of the grave sites.
I was working with the remains of a young girl, maybe 13.
she'd been shot in the head and dumped into a well.
this cop shows up, and he might have been a soldier, it's not easy to tell.
I thought he was there to guard me, but he told me to stop.
when I refused, he called in two others.
they put a bag over my head and tossed me into a cell with a dirt floor and no windows.
for how long?
later I found out it was three days.
but I thought it was a week, maybe more.
he came in every day and made me believe I was going to die.
he said that he'd shoot me and toss me into a well, and that no one would ever know who I was or what became of me.
I promised myself, if I ever had the chance, I'd get even.
that doesn't mean I need therapy.
I identified the type of wood in the weapon that killed Maria.
am I interrupting a female moment?
no. What was the wood? Quarter-sawn cumuru.
definitely not from a shovel handle.
what is made out of quarter-sawn cumuru?
very expensive furniture.
Senatorially expensive? - Most definitely.
I don't recognize her, no.
neither do I, I'm afraid. - How about you, Hector?
her name was Maria.
she used to work as a maid here.
she had papers.
fake ones- probably supplied by our friendly neighborhood gang.
Hector couldn't possibly be expected to identify forged papers.
what happened to Maria?
one day she didn't show up for work. That's all.
did she interact with anyone here besides Jos?
I don't know about that kind of thing.
what kind of thing, Hector?
I don't know anything.
what do you mean, Hector?
was Maria involved with the senator?
what? Of course not. - No.
no, not the senator.
well, tell the truth, Hector- this is the FBI.
Logan. She was involved with Logan.
what kind of "involved"?
I'd rather not say.
Maria's dead, Logan. - M-Maria's dead?
Yes.
of course that changes things.
Maria and I were...
what, you were lovers?
bones, what the hell are you doing?
how long have you had this bed?
uh, since I was, like, 15. Why?
do you know what kind of wood it is?
Curu... cumuru. Something like that. Why?
cause Maria's skull was banged in by something made out of cumuru wood.
there's dried blood and skin on this post.
I caught Maria dancing once, in the hallway.
she thought no one was watching, but...
I was watching.
I had noticed her before.
she was, uh...very pretty.
more than what these pictures tell you.
Logan, I will say again that I do not advise answering questions.
you're not under arrest.
perhaps you'd like to check with the senator and see if he'd rather I'd officially arrested Logan before asking these questions, because I'm sure the press would love that.
when did you start having a sexual relationship with Maria?
perhaps six months ago. - You kept it a secret?
Maria was certain that...
if my parents found out she'd be fired.
are you aware that she was in this country illegally.
I advise you do not answer that question.
were you aware that she was pregnant?
m- Maria was pregnant?
Logan, there's no proof that you were the father.
no, shut up.
of course I'm the father.
what about the father?
a powerful man with lots to lose, I mean, why kill her?
why not have her deported in the middle of the night?
that leaves Hector.
he's responsible for hiring the servants.
I mean, one of them gets pregnant, he feels like it's his mess to clean up.
we still can't figure out how maria's skull was fractured by the bedpost.
well, that's sort of your line of work, Bones, okay? So, go have fun.
your top three suspects are senator Corman, six foot one, Logan Corman, five foot ten and Hector Santiago, five foot six.
Maria was five foot one.
the bed is a California king with seven-foot posts.
and assuming that they argued near the foo of the bed...
given there relative heights, the angle of impact doesn't match.
her skull connects well below where you found the traces of blood.
what if they were standing on the bed?
well, it's high enough, but her head struck the outside of the post.
how tall would her assailant have to be to fit the evidence?
that... that's tall.
seven foot eight.
somebody you'd notice around the house.
let's think outside the box.
what do you mean- like go non-human?
no. What else explains striking the bedpost in that manner?
I guess... falling. - Falling?
Maria was a maid. Do you have a schematic version of the room?
if she fell backwards...but it doesn't explain the damage done to her skull.
okay, what force does explain the damage?
206 pounds per square inch, which means she would have had to have fallen from a height of...
it's no good.
I know what happened.
she was yanked off the ladder.
you mean somebody pulled her off?
Yes. The missing 84 pounds per square inch can be explained by a hard yank from a full-grown man.
I don't know if it's murder, but someone is definitely responsible for Maria's death.
this is not about the gang.
the gang had nothing to do with her death.
Maria was pulled off that ladder.
I got nothing to say.
what did the senator offer you, huh?
asylum?
for the whole family?
I know what happened.
your father died of cancer.
around the same time, your wife was pregnant.
you wanted your child to be born an American citizen, so you couldn't reportyour father's death for fear of being deported.
you buried him yourself.
in the garden.
when your sister died, you buried her in the same place.
as my father died, he said to me, "you take care of your sister."
you joined Mara Muerte so you can get fake papers, so she could work for the senator.
Maria, she was so angry she would, she'd get so angry sometimes she just doesn't speak to me.
she didn't understand what you had to do for her and your family.
it was the only way for me to keep my promise to my father.
look at me now, huh?
all because I wanted to give my sister and my father a beautiful place to rest.
it's near... it's near a pond.
it's beautiful, huh?
it's all for nothing.
my family's ruined.
she didn't fall. - No, she was pushed.
no, senator, actually she was pulled, probably off that ladder.
pulled? Pulled by who? - Perhaps by your son or the senator.
Oh, my god. I do not pull maids off of ladders.
will you please open that up?
and, and why would they do something like that?
because Maria was pregnant by your son.
what?
even if that were true, that is not how we would handle the situation.
Yeah, you'd have her deported in the middle of the night.
it would be handled, and not by pulling her off a ladder.
senator, would you mind reaching up?
what is that gonna prove?
are you refusing, sir?
I'm trained in kinesiology, the study of human movement.
Oh, and you're gonna be able to tell who pulled her off the ladder.
absolutely, yes.
Oh, for god's sake, Alan, just do it. Just do it.
fine.
well? Was it me?
Hector? - Sir?
would you please pull me down off this ladder?
no. No, I won't.
Hector, just do as she asks.
how did it happen, Hector?
you told her to stay out of Logan's room, didn't you?
you didn't approve.
you knew what was going on. - Hector?
if it wasn't you, just pull me down.
Maria defied you, she went to Logan's room.
you got angry, you pulled her off the ladder.
it was an accident.
Yeah.
it was an accident.
I can't believe that worked. - Psychology, Bones, is a very powerful force.
I gave her $500 and I drove her home.
I- I thought she was going to go to a doctor.
she was afraid she'd lose her job and get deported.
you should have told us.
you don't want to know.
you don't want to know about any of this.
I know my job.
I know what you want.
Hector Alvarado, I'm placing you under arrest.
on suspicion of manslaughter.
booth? - Yeah.
message from the gang task force unit.
uh, Mara Muerte has put a hit out on your lady scientist.
Oh, man. You got a response?
Yeah, just tell 'em...
tell 'em I got the message. Tell 'em thanks. - Sure.
this is nice of you.
not many people would pay for a funeral like this.
where is Booth? - He said he'd come.
are you crazy? This is my neighborhood.
you put a hit out on my partner? - She's not FBI.
I never said anythg about FBI.
she's my partner. And if anything happens to her i will find you and I will kill you. I won't think twice.
look at me. Look in my eyes.
look at my face.
if anything happens to her, I will kill you.
this is between you and me. Nobody sees, nobody knows.
you got nothing to prove. Understand? You understand?!
Yeah. I thought so. Okay?
now, if you don't mind, I'll leave first because I have somewhere I have to be.
I will pay you back for this funeral.
don't worry about it.
it's my family. It's my duty.
aren't you leaving for El Salvador tonight?
my child is an American.
he's... he's not gonna grow up the way that Rosa and I did.
she says that we're gonna bring him back.
I understand.
one way or another, your son will have a better life than you did.
am I in trouble?
you're late for a funeral.
of course you're in trouble.
sorry. I apologize. I...
everything okay here?
where were you?
I had something to do. - More important than a funeral?
I thought so at the time.
Engelsviken Norway, we got a tip that it could be human what do you think？ I need to get closer? close enough?
definitely human, definitely human, and according to the orthodonture, American, American?
are you certain?
Yes. America. Good, let's give it back to them
Norway?
we don't have enough crucified corpses of our own?
now the Vikings are sending them?
the annual murder rate in Norway is 0.7.
less than one murder a year?
in that case, they should solve the ones they have or they'll never get any practice.
the victim is American.
still, if a Norwegian was murdered here, we'd conduct the investigation.
but the Norwegians say the victim died here and then got shipped to Norway.
what's their evidence?
nothing forensic.
it's just police work.
the remains were found in the possession of a Norwegian black metal band.
what's black metal?
I don't know, it's Norwegian.
whole different kind of black.
apparently, it's a genre of heavy metal featuring macabre imagery of death and horrific violence.
that's the name of the band-- Skalle.
Oh, it means "skull."
you speak Norwegian?
no, I'm a forensic anthropologist.
I know how to say "skull" in just about every language.
well, Skalle... - "Skall-eh.
Skall-ay... - "Skall-eh.
they stole the body from an American metal band while on tour in DC six months ago.
the remains are male, late teens.
significant staining on the...
Skall-EH.
SKALL-eh.
it leached into the bone.
desiccated flesh on the face and scalp.
perhaps enough for DNA.
if the scraps of clothing and the boots were actually on the victim when he died, then...
maybe Hodgins can give us something.
what's, what's the story on this?
the posterior ribs were either broken or severed.
detached at the spine and then fanned out.
it's the Blood Eagle.
beg pardon?
it was an ancient torture in which the victim was held face down while his back was sliced open.
the ribs were then broken at the spine and then spread to look like an eagle, thus the name.
absence of blood on the periosteal surface of the fractures suggests the ribs were broken postmortem.
I'll remove the bones from the cross and clean them, see if we can find the cause of death.
this is definitely murder.
there are other possibilities.
I have to admit none spring to mind.
Drug-abusing teens robbed death- a grave and reenact an ancient torture.
Ah, just another Saturday night.
right, okay, so for the Norwegian crucifixion case,
I'm gonna need to know all there is about the heavy metal music scene in DC.
okay, and tell me what, get me all the recordings that you can.
I think you're going to have to be more specific than that, Agent Booth.
there's black metal, speed metal, grindcore, thrash, doom, drone, glam, sludge, metalcore, stoner metal, death metal, and deathcore.
must you shake my hand with quite such a vise-like grip?
right, yeah, okay, did you get all that? Go, go, go.
thought you were a psychiatrist. How'd you become such a musical expert?
Oh, I've got quite a, quite a musical background, you know.
Oh, yeah, right, Saint, um, Weatherby's Glee Club in Doo-Daw-on-Henley?
so...I thought we loaned you out to Interpol?
Yes, part of the serial killer task force, traveling the globe bathed in perversion and gore.
have a seat.
and on a happier note, I'm to meet your bright young thing.
Dr. Sweets?
sweets, why Sweets?
well, he wants to interview me for the book he's writing on you and the lovely Dr. Brennan.
anyway, I can see you're busy.
listen, uh, perhaps while I'm here I can barbecue for you one evening.
Oh, no, no, I am the barbecue master, remember?
you can do the boiling.
Ah, I have it on good authority that my culinary skills have advanced somewhat since last we ate.
anyway, it's good to see you.
Yeah, you, too.
I have a computer rendering of what our victim might have looked like.
look at him.
he's a puppy.
278-pound puppy.
sometimes puppies are big.
prelim tox results came back negative for embalming fluid.
so he was never buried in a sanctioned grave?
so probably murdered.
murdered and his remains crucified for the entertainment of people who hate life.
it's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. Sweets.
Dr. Wyatt, I am a huge admirer of your book on the role of sexual sadism in female serial killers.
do I detect a certain caveat in your tone?
uh...Well, the sample is small.
comparatively speaking, there are few female serial killers.
I was wondering if you had a chance to take a look at...
your manuscript?
Yes, indeed, and may I say, Dr. Sweets, that I think this is probably the best work I have ever read on the dynamics of opposite personality types working towards a common... cause.
okay, now I'm hearing a caveat.
I-it's a small one.
it's just that Brennan and Booth aren't in any way opposites.
wow, small?
what is that-- British understatement?
well, yes, he's a man; she's a woman.
he's instinctual; she's empirical.
opposites.
superficial ephemera, Dr. Sweets.
okay, what about the sexual component in their relationship?
would you agree that they have both sublimated their attraction to each other out of fear of endangering their working relationship because their working relationship is paramount to both of them?
alas, I'm afraid I wouldn't agree with that, no.
which part?
with everything you just said.
Yes, one of them is acutely aware of that attraction.
struggles with it daily, as a matter of fact.
I'm sorry I keep saying that...
but which one?
it's your book, Dr. Sweets.
I would never tell you what to write.
I was actually going to ask you to write the introduction.
that's very flattering, but I'm retiring.
I am relinquishing the field to young Turks like you.
do you think she actually enjoys this?
this whole sexual abstinence thing-- totally twisting her out of shape.
Oh, here, the, uh...staining on the skull was propylene glycol dicocoate, alkyl benzoate, and sorbitan sesquioleate.
what is that, some kind of systemic poison?
that's common theatrical makeup.
it leached into the skull during decomp.
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I put the music on to get me in the right space.
well, extrapolating from the stains on the skull, it turns out that at the time of his death, our victim looked like this.
looks like your puppy moonlighted as a zombie werewolf.
Yeah, I ran this through my facial recognition program with an image search of metal Web pages.
check this out.
there's our boy.
spew.
it's very evocative.
so our victim-- Mayhem-- was the bassist.
the drummer is Wrath and the guitarist Pinworm, but they do have a new bassist now.
his name is Grinder.
what about real names?
I imagine they play that pretty close to the vest.
Yeah, kind of ruins the magic when you find out that Satan's name is Todd or Larry.
okay. I'll tell Booth to search for a death metal band named Spew.
wait a second.
what do you mean Gordon-Gordon is going to quit psychiatry?
well, I asked him to write the intro to my book about you two.
he told me he couldn't because he was retiring.
is it possible he just hated your book?
thank you.
perhaps now he'll find a pursuit worthy of his intellect-- neurochemistry, for example.
Yeah. Booth. Hold on, slow down.
okay, why would a man with Wyatt's insights into the human psyche want to be a mere scientist?
no offense.
perhaps because psychology is a field which is ill-defined in conception and ineffective in execution.
thank you.
okay, sounds great.
so Cam says we got to track down a death metal band named Spew.
they're totally underground-- no concerts listed, no contact information.
a death metal band? - Yeah.
but our victim's skeleton was found in the possession of a Norwegian black metal band.
death metal, black metal, what's the difference?
in essence, death metal is about brutal technical proficiency while black metal is about emotion.
now, both of 'em exploit adolescent feelings of alienation, depression...
right,'cause it all just sounds like a truck full of cymbals crashing into a saw factory for me.
historically, picayune internecine squabbles account for a huge number of deaths.
bones, just figure out cause of death for me, all right,"interoserine" or whatever.
how do you know so much about this?
I was really into death metal...as a teenager, not anymore.
obviously.
Really?
Oh, come on.
come on, what?
I don't like that anymore.
according to Booth, there's no way to track down this band Spew.
no bars, clubs, or high schools.
the cross is carved of 120-year-old black oak and was stolen from St. Benedict Episcopal Church six months ago.
that is some determined desecration going on.
Yeah, well, the bones themselves were covered in a patina of smoke, tobacco, marijuana, meth, animal blood, semen, and saliva.
who are these people?
sweets sent over a briefing.
concerts are set up at secret locations, and then only insiders are invited.
then, how do we find them?
well, the dried mud from the treads of the boots that were duct-taped to the victim contained bovine fragments and infectious prion proteins.
a slaughterhouse?
a slaughterhouse closed down due to mad cow disease.
death metal enthusiasts prefer morbid, horror-centric venues for performance.
in addition, they tend to perform for their fans in the same place they practice and sometimes squat.
like maybe this horror-centric, condemned slaughterhouse.
wait. How do we know that those are his boots?
he was in Norway for months.
you are going to be so proud.
the victim's foot size is 11, same as his boots.
we need something more than a matching shoe size.
he's not finished.
wear on his calcaneus and cuboid suggest our victim walked mostly on the outside of his feet.
Supinator.
one percent of the population are supinators.
that's a lot.
one percent of size 11 teenagers isn't good enough?
this missing toe...did it fall off after decomposition, or was it a preexisting condition?
that's exactly what I was thinking.
you see here?
his toes left an impression inside the boot, but there is no impression corresponding with the big toe.
are you satisfied that this was the boot worn by the victim while he was still alive?
it's a reasonable conclusion.
you want to say,"King of the Lab"?
no.
so, why do I have the feeling that I'm being taken somewhere terrible for a...
a gangland whacking?
we are going somewhere terrible. We are.
look, we... we need your expertise.
well, I'm sure the estimable Dr. Sweets is more than qualified.
booth is lying about needing you. - What?
he wants to talk you out of quitting psychiatry.
bones, I was easing into that, okay?
as a matter of fact, I might be able to help.
you know, as a young man, I dabbled quite extensively in the rock music scene.
Oh, wait a second. What were you, lead dulcimer in a flute band?
as a matter of fact, I was the founding member of a proto-glam rock outfit.
I don't know what that means.
it means that for three glorious years, I wore spandex, silver lam?
pancake makeup, and played a guitar shaped like a spaceship.
I was quite pretty in my way.
wait.
you... you were Noddy Comet.
what's that?
noddy Comet! I always wondered what happened to you.
you were Noddy.
I changed jobs. That's all.
I got to get some of those original tapes.
actually, you know, that fellow playing the bass is really rather good.
what?
okay, let's shut it down, guys. Come on. FBI.
let's go!
Hey, I said...
FBI. Shut it down.
Yes.
now, if you recall that it was shooting inanimate objects that had you brought to me for therapy in the first place.
I thought it was a justifiable shooting.
I agree.
she agrees, see?
you going to put your gun down?
don't rush me, okay?
well, are you coming?
Nope, I discharged my weapon.
I pulled desk duty until the paperwork clears.
you're 50 feet away.
at my desk, okay, so just put in the earplug and let's do this.
don't tell Sweets about the ear bud.
booth wants us to interrogate them.
Yeah, he's not really supposed to be watching on his laptop and talking in your ear.
so, just tell him that's not happening.
these are their real names: Monty Bigelow, Matt Stickney, and Darrel Moss.
all right, Bones, so just ease into this.
what was Mayhem's real name?
or you can just go at them like a freight train.
dabbler.
his stage name was Mayhem, not Dabbler.
Mayhem's a dabbler.
a poseur.
a douche.
do you want to spend time in jail, Pinhead?
you can't actually arrest people, Bones.
we live in a slaughterhouse.
you got something worse than that?
all right, let's start over.
tell us the name that Mayhem's mother and father gave him, and we'll charge you with assaulting a federal agent.
Oh, no, you have that backwards.
no, Bones, he's right, okay? They want to be arrested.
reverse psychology.
that term is almost always misused.
look, just tell Tapeworm that felony assault is the best you can do.
felony assault is the best we can do...
tapeworm.
take it or leave it.
when did you last see Justin?
when I killed him, ate his heart, and took his job.
I killed him, too.
I never even noticed he was gone.
I ate his face off before I killed him.
I am so much better at interrogation than I thought.
those aren't legitimate confessions.
all right, guys.
come on, give us a real answer.
about a year ago, when he quit the band.
how about those charges?
Oh, where's he going?
booth. - Yeah?
the one called Grinder is different from the others.
his body language displays an emotional connection to the murder victim.
okay, so, uh, what do you think we should do?
we should arrange to have him cleaned up-- revealed, so to speak -
so that Dr. Wyatt and I can talk to him and exploit that connection.
Okay...all right, then.
you do that. I'll stay here on desk duty.
okay.
posterior ilium, right side, damage to the cortical bone layer, extending into the trabecular.
this skeleton was carted from DC to Norway, then used as a prop at ultraviolent concerts.
there's bound to be damage.
I enlarged the X-ray.
see the multiple clefts and wastage?
suggesting the damage done to the pelvic bone happened very near time of death?
now, because Dr. Brennan isn't here, I'll guess that these gouge marks came from a knife.
someone went digging into the victim's gluteus?
Yes. Bone damage consistent with a bullet wound.
So...the victim was shot in the ass, then killed in some way yet to be determined, then the killer dug the bullet out of the...
Gluteus. Yes.
okay. Let's have Hodgins swab for trace evidence.
God knows what he'll find.
maybe a little piece of Norway.
Ah, Darrel Moss.
come in. Sit down.
my name's Grinder.
grinder, have you looked in the mirror?
where are the other guys?
did you delouse them, too?
no, nobody else.
just you, Darrel.
you're the new guy in the band, right?
you replaced Mayhem on bass?
I told you.
I killed him for the job.
Dr. Wyatt tells me that you are a skilled, classically trained bassist influenced by...
who is it? - Jaco Pastorius.
but you do everything you can to hide that, don't you?
I never heard of him.
no, no,'cause that would...that would ruin your street cred.
Justin Dancy's remains show evidence of being used as a stage prop for approximately the last six months, four of those in Norway.
his name was Mayhem.
he wasn't always Mayhem.
just as you weren't always Grinder.
look, there he is.
there's Justin.
and that's you, Darrel.
Justin and Darrel.
you see, what we want to do is find whoever it was that killed your boyhood friend.
what makes you think I even know?
everyone knows everything in the metal world.
it's a small world breeding whispers, conjecture...secrets.
you may have even heard rumors of who murdered him.
but you're not going to tell us, are you?
cause we're outsiders.
that would be breaking the code.
so, we're just going to ask: who had him before the Norwegians?
who crucified your boyhood friend?
we would have got him back, you know.
got him back from who?
excuse me?
that lame deathcore outfit?
they consider themselves deathcore.
I consider them crapcore.
what they did to Justin, though, was totally awesome.
it was brilliant.
and what would you have done with Justin if you had stolen him back?
we would have hung him up behind us, man.
it would have been epic.
legendary.
I'm disturbed that despite my extensive training as an anthropologist, all of these bands sound alike and appear to share identical belief systems and mores.
Yeah, right, except for the trained anthropologist part, that's how my dad felt about Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys.
I have no idea what you're saying.
listen, Bones, I don't want you there alone, okay?
just get a good look at this guy, and you get out; do you understand?
you ready?
sweets is there? - Sweets?
well, I think it's him.
Yeah, I had to meld to get information.
Zorch's lead singer is Murderbreath.
look at that. Who does he think he is? The guy with the tongue from Kiss?
do you know what? Just tell Sweets to leave Gene alone.
just get a photo, and get out of there.
Zorch and Spew are sworn enemies.
it started out with the fans throwing feces at each other, then some attacks.
culminating in medieval torture?
do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
wait. He's got a knife. - Who's got a knife?
do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
Nah, don't worry. It's totally fake.
that's... not fake.
whoa, whoa, what's happening?
Murderbreath slit his own throat.
excuse me.
we need a compress.
you could've asked.
hold this against the wound.
booth, can you call it in?
listen, I'm not hanging up, Bones...
help is coming. - Bones?
stand back, please. FBI. Stand back!
why'd you arrest me? I'm the one with the cut throat.
maybe you shouldn't talk too much.
uh, no, his larynx wasn't affected.
this is my actual voice.
sounds exactly like when you sing.
like gravel in a hubcap.
so, that was a very good night for you.
word gets around that you slit your own throat for real...
you got it.
tonight, I'm a legend.
do you have any idea who switched your prop knife?
one of the guys in the band, a fan, someone from another band, maybe I did it myself. Who cares?
I bet it was Spew. - How about Spew?
evidence indicates that you killed and crucified their bassist.
this just gets better and better. I'm getting credit for that?
no. See, the thing is, that same credit could send you to prison.
okay, listen, Bones, just tell him you don't care if he did it or not, you'll just throw his ass in jail.
look, it's all right to lie during an interrogation, Bones.
it's a technique.
the evidence is inconclusive regarding your guilt, but I'll damn well make sure it's conclusive!
whoa, what? - Attagirl. Give it to him.
I will perjure myself if I have to, because you...
make... me... sick, punk.
Dr. Brennan...
I'll put your ass on death row and laugh at your execution.
I will testify that your knife was used to make these gouges.
I will also prove that whatever implements we find -
any props, knives, cleavers, all of your stage ware -
I will show that it was used to mutilate his remains.
which they probably were. - Good to know.
there's no rock concerts in prison.
there are no rock concerts in prison. - Rock concerts?
I want immunity from desecration of human remains.
no promises, dirtbag!
just tell him that we will talk to the prosecutor on your behalf.
but we'll see what we can do.
maybe six months ago, there's a rumor,
Mayhem's dead and buried under Bridge 6, westbound lane State Road 66.
6-6-6-- the sign of the devil.
who told you? - I dunno. Nobody.
everybody. It was in the air, man. Dug up the bones.
somebody heard about this old Viking torture thing.
sounded like a great gag, and it was, until Skall stole it.
Skall-eh.
doesn't matter. - Just trying to help.
I dug him up, stole the cross, fastened the bones to it.
but you didn't kill him.
I believe him.
now, my last official task as an FBI shrink is to declare you fit for duty.
Gordon, Gordon, gun under the table.
I'm sorry. Sorry. Jeez.
so, Booth is back? - He's back.
Hey, so, what's next for you, Doc?
I mean, when you stop shrinking heads?
I've been accepted by the Institute of Culinary Arts.
you're going to be a chef? - That's correct. Yes.
I'm going to put good things into people instead of taking out things that are bad.
which I know sounds rather Freudian, but...
Sigmund's been largely discredited so to hell with him.
I don't see why you can't do both.
well, we still don't know who murdered Justin Dancy.
baby steps. You will prevail.
this subculture takes every notion of community and turns it upside down.
well, no matter what they say, the fact remains that they are artists.
they create. No true nihilists ever creates.
these dark tortured people may rail against the night, but they make music.
on an oscilloscope, what we call "music" is demonstrably distinct from we call "noise.
your Dr. Sweets liked it as an adolescent.
he's turned out rather well...
for the most part.
for the most part?
well, I read his book.
and, as is the case with most writing, it reveals more about the writer than about the subject matter, which, in this case, is you.
can you provide an example?
for one thing, he finds it extremely frustrating -
your lack of willingness to discuss your childhood experiences with him.
what does that tell you? - No, do not ask him that.
he's going to think we both had traumatic childhoods. - We did.
your father was a violent drunk and mine abandoned me.
great, thank you. Just tell everybody here at the diner, won't you, Bones? Go ahead.
Sweets...has scars on his back.
old ones. - Really?
what kind of scars?
well, like he'd been whipped. - Whipped?
I saw them.
that explains his near-obsession with your childhood trauma, doesn't it?
okay, I did an Internet search of Spew's concerts.
now, this stuff is all uploaded from cell phones, so the quality is crap.
all right, check this out.
this girl runs up. Here's the gun.
she fires, then Mayhem literally spews the blood all over the crowd.
and there's the blood.
okay, obviously fake.
Yeah, it's a set piece. I've seen this same setup maybe 60 times in two years.
is it the same girl every time?
I'm pretty sure it is.
the image quality stinks.
except I combined all the different cell phone versions...
nice! We can get an ID from that.
can you arrange these shows in chronological order?
well, they all contain embedded cell phone codes so, yeah.
did he ever bleed from his ass?
because that's where we found the bullet fragments.
Clark determined that the gunshot wound to the victim's ilium occurred ten months prior to his death.
there.
he fell down that time behind the audience.
have you got another angle on this?
Oh, there. The bullet splinters his instrument.
right into his ass. That's our money shot right there.
not so tough when the blood is real, are you, metal boy?
so, this is you, isn't it?
my manager said not to talk to you until he gets here.
death metal chicks have managers?
Ah, look at that.
metal to what? Power punk?
it's a much larger market, but I still retain my artistic integrity.
right. Do you still shoot bass players in your new gig?
is that was this is about?
not my fault, someone replaced the blank with a real bullet.
no, I think you knew that the bullet was there.
otherwise, you would've shot the guy in the neck like every other time.
I'm waiting until my manager gets here.
okay. We can do that. In the meantime, I'm going to show you this picture here.
you see... Your boyfriend is flinching before you even pulled the trigger.
I say the two of you were working on this together.
it was Justin's idea, okay?
he was always trying to prove to the other guys he was more hardcore than them.
was he? - Well, uh...
he wanted me to shoot him, so, yeah, I gave him his props.
so, what? Now that I'm making some money, he's coming after me for shooting him in the ass two years ago?
Justin's dead. He was murdered.
what? Oh, God, those stupid bastards.
those stupid...
you have to get them. - Get who?
you know, probably a fan found out.
you know, maybe someone in Spew.
this is totally my fault. - Okay, found out what? Why is it your fault?
maybe a year ago, he gave me a call saying that, you know, he wanted to get back together, join my band.
some hardcore metal fanatic found out and killed him.
the striae and kerf width on each side of the bisected ribs match the saw that the FBI found at the Zorch concert.
fingerprints are all Murderbreath's.
he already confessed to digging up the corpse and mutilating it.
so you're looking at the greenstick fractures?
Yes.
would you mind getting on all fours?
uh, is that strictly necessary?
Yes, please.
so the fractures are adjacent to the articulation with the spine.
now, with evidence of inward bowing ...
incomplete fractures, evidence of inward bowing-- if I place my knee in your back...
tunnel vision, Dr. Brennan.
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.
that scenario explains all the bone damage and fractures.
so stabbed and then garroted?
what if the wounds to the C5 aren't from a stab, but instead the result of the victim being garroted?
the puncture occurred on the back of his neck.
but what would do that?
barbed wire.
Yeah.
Yes, his ex-girlfriend is right.
following her into the mainstream would be seen as the ultimate betrayal.
Mmm, like leaving a cult?
we think that the victim was garroted, most likely with barbed wire.
the murderer will lay claim. He'll keep a souvenir.
Yes, in the same way that a serial killer will.
right, but it isn't for his own satisfaction.
it's a way of boasting of what he's done to the community.
Yeah, it's a totem, a signifier of some kind that can only be discerned by the cognoscenti.
okay, now how are we going to figure this out?
none of us speak Italian.
he does that, doesn't he? He wants to be underestimated.
you, you're one of the cognoscenti, Dr. Sweets.
Oh, no. I've out grown that. Mostly.
okay, maybe sometimes I'll listen to a few bootleg tapes when I've had a bad day...
but that's good because this music sucks, and the people who listen to it are defective.
thank you so much.
I have no doubt that your parents said the same thing to you when you were listening to my music, Agent Booth.
now, according to one of your squint reports a bullet was gouged out of the victim's ass?
you read Clark's report?
well, only because I was on desk duty.
now, that bullet could be a good totem pole.
a totem, Booth. A totem pole is much larger.
Yes, but nonetheless, it would be a good totem pole otherwise.
so someone murdered the kid for leaving the fold...
then uses a knife to gouge out the bullet.
buries the body under the bridge.
knowing that the cognoscenti will see the bullet and assume he is the murderer.
but Murderbreath finds the body, puts it on display.
Mm-hmm, stealing credit.
so, we're looking for a bullet then?
look here.
our good, happy friend Pinworm wears a smashed bullet around his neck inside of a cross.
is it too much to hope that the fellow's scratching out his confession in block letters?
right here, right inside the cross: . 22 caliber.
completely consistent with the mark it left in the victim's ilium.
okay, Bones and I are going to go in there.
what we do not need to hear is a lot of psychological mumbo jumbo stuff in our ears.
okay, so are you bored with psychiatry?
is that it, people don't have the capacity to surprise you anymore?
Oh, people surprise me. You surprise me.
me?
few people looking at you would know what you'd been through.
I beg your pardon?
well, you were adopted.
and the people who adopted you were an older couple.
probably too old for standard adoption of an infant, meaning you weren't an infant.
you were, what... four?
six.
six, yeah. Special needs.
a child who'd been through some sort of hell, a damaged child.
but these were loving, wonderful people.
Yes.
they saved you... but now, they're gone. You're an orphan?
my parents died within weeks of each other.
recently, I'd say. The wound is still fresh.
just before I came to work here.
so now, you're mostly alone in the world.
but they had time to save you.
they gave you a good life, and that's why you believe that people can be saved by other people with good hearts.
that's the gift your parents left you.
that, and the gift of a truly good heart.
that gives you a deeper calling I do not share.
I don't remember where I got this bullet.
well, you dug it out of Justin Dancy's pelvic bone with a knife.
hardcore, man.
I-I dug it out of his ass, and then hung it around my neck.
legendary.
if people think that means I killed him, there's nothing I can do about it.
you know... you're one of us.
up to your elbows in corpses and murder.
it's hot. - Thank you.
so what, was, uh, Lexie like your Yoko Ono?
what is that? A Bible reference?
so let's just say Justin decided to go with Lexie.
what would that do to your band?
no way any member of Spew does that.
never happen.
why not?
well, because we are the real thing, the genuine item.
our music isn't made to be enjoyed.
it's made to be feared.
it comes straight from hell.
right. You don't know anything about hell.
and you do?
well, see, I was a soldier and a cop.
I've identified hundreds of victims of genocide.
I accept hell as a metaphor for what I've seen.
you haven't seen hell until you've been inside my head, dreamed my nightmares.
your delusional, cozy reality doesn't even come close.
he's, uh, he's enjoying this attention.
it's what he feels on stage, isn't it? The... the power.
but his sense of power is totally dependent on an audience.
um, ruminate on Milton, Agent Booth.
think Paradise Lost.
what does that mean?
Oh, uh, Satan's greatest sin was pride, vanity.
right, okay-- well, you know what? You're free to go.
uh, what?
well, my associate here tells me that Murderbreath confessed to the murder and crucifixion of Justin Dancy, so you're free to go.
whoa, what? Murderbreath? - Yeah. You're free to go. Come on.
no, Murderbreath did not kill anybody.
he weighs, what, 40 pounds? Have you not seen Mayhem?
Murderbreath didn't strangle somebody with barbed wire.
it takes heft to choke a big guy to death.
barbed wire?
wow, well, you know, nobody said anything about barbed wire.
I think the correct term is "gotcha.
look at that, unbelievable.
this is you singing?
well, yeah, my alter ego, I supposed you might say.
a bisexual spaceman with a taste for six-inch platform shoes, spandex, glitter and an exhibitionist's disdain for underclothing.
well, here's to Gordon-Gordon.
without him, we would not have been able to solve the murder.
I hate to admit it, but it's true.
to Gordon-Gordon.
stop, please.
look, this is exactly what Sweets wanted.
I'm too good a psychiatrist ever to leave, et cetera.
well, no... Just put your glasses down, would you? Please.
might I offer you a word of advice regarding young Dr. Sweets?
might we try to stop you?
why do we need advice about Sweets?
we don't. Sweets is just fine.
he most definitely is not fine.
I've read his book.
what, does he say something mean about us?
on the contrary.
you might as well know that he lost both his adoptive parents just before he came to work for your de facto crime-fighting unit.
jeez, what are we, The Land of Misfit Toys?
well, he's a good lad, Sweets, but this book he's writing, he's using it as the vehicle to get what he actually wants, which is...
a family.
so he imprinted on us? Like a baby duck?
so what do we do? - Nothing.
okay, Sweets is not a baby duck.
he wants what we all want.
he wants to find out his place in the world.
we can find a permanent place for him. Right?
Gordon-Gordon is going to want us to divulge or share or bond or something awful.
look, perhaps you might just show the lad that he's not the only one with scars on his back.
but he is. Too literal?
by the way, what I'm making here, this is the masterpiece that got me accepted into the Culinary Institute.
all right, but it doesn't keep.
so, uh, be back in an hour, yeah? Let's go.
but where are we going? - Duck hunting. Come on.
not literally. Right? - Come on.
I miss you, rock and roll. I really do.
sweets?
what are you doing here?
well, uh, Gordon-Gordon is, uh, making dinner for us at my place, family-style.
and, um, you're invited.
thank you, but I've actually got a lot of work here...
my foster parents locked me in the trunk of a car for two days when I broke a dish.
I was a very clumsy child.
they warned me it would happen, but the water was so hot and the...
soap was so slippery.
I still don't think it was fair, even though they gave me fair warning.
the water was so hot...
no, it wasn't fair at all. It wasn't your fault.
you said that "scars on the Bones, whaback" was a metaphor.
isn't that why we're here, to metaphorically compare scars?
I came to bring Sweets back to my place for dinner, that's all.
scars on the back"?
I saw them, Sweets.
so...
what? You decided to just are something from your past?
that is so unlike you.
I still hate psychology.
okay. Your turn. Go.
I came here to bring Sweets back to my place for dinner, that's all.
okay, if it wasn't for my grandfather, I probably would've killed myself when I was a kid.
that's all I'm going to say on the subject matter. Understand?
are you okay, Bones? - Yeah, I'm fine. Here.
why are you nodding? - Nothing. Just...
Wyatt made an observation about you two, and I think I just saw what he saw.
you coming?
booth means that we'd like it if you joined us.
thank you. - Great! Here we go. Let's go.
Gordon-Gordon is making cassoulet. - It's stew. It's bean stew.
cassoulet is better than regular stew, Booth.
just because it's French doesn't mean it's better.
bones
it sounds better than stew.
see?
it's stew. - Sounds better.
it's stew.
: do you have therapy today?
it's not therapy.
well, you're seeing a psychiatrist.
not for therapy.
it's an official evaluation, okay?
person who found the body is in the living room.
great. Crime scene first, then we talk to the witnesses.
corpse is going to be in the den. Thanks.
what is that? What's what?
your tie, it's staid.
Staid? Yeah, boring.
it looks like J. Edgar Hoover picked it out.
look, it's something I'm working on, okay?
in therapy?
Gordon-Gordon says that the, you know, the wild socks and the fancy ties are all just, you know, quiet rebellions helping me suppress other impulses.
isn't that good?
you'd think so, right?
but you know, apparently, all the other issues have to just rise to the top.
why do you call your psychiatrist Gordon-Gordon?
because that's how he introduces himself, you know.
Hi. I'm Gordon. Gordon Wyatt.
like James. James Bond.
bond. James Bond.
not James. Ja... Jam... Whatever.
SAROYAN: We're over here.
and you might want to tuck your pants into your socks.
the flies get in everywhere.
what, no cartoon characters on the socks?
never had cartoon characters on the socks.
they were just... Um... Never mind, okay?
what do we get here?
three weeks decomp, give or take.
Ah, the place was tossed, huh?
no forced entry.
the victim is probably the man of the house:
his wife Clarissa identified the watch and wedding ring.
this isn't good for me.
Yeah, it's pretty gross.
no, not that.
there's too much soft tissue for me to tell anything.
in fact, why am I here at all? The Bancroft family asked for us specifically.
what, they got some kind of pull?
the Bancroft Wing at the Jeffersonian?
60 million bucks will buy a lot of goodwill.
BOOTH: Typical.
this dried crust here at the mouth.
when the jugular's cut, the air mixes with venous blood and the negative pressure causes an air embolism.
death is very quick.
so just sit there and stop complaining.
bound. Multiple stab wounds.
we need photos of these spatter patterns.
bet this statue is worth more than my house.
you know, you should ask your therapist about your issues with rich people.
you're in therapy?
he's seen the socks.
SAROYAN: The victim's wife is in the kitchen.
I was, I was at the Vineyard for a month.
and Terry was supposed to be at his fishing camp in Idaho, so the house was closed up.
and you didn't try to contact him at all during that time?
we spoke three weeks ago, um, the day before he was supposed to leave.
the cabin doesn't get cell service.
I heard the officers talking about a possible home invasion?
definite possibility.
well, Terry supports a youth center on the other side of the Anacostia River.
rough neighborhood, tough kids.
I was always afraid to go there, but he said it was because I didn't really know them.
Yeah. Listen, I'd like you to put a list of things together that might have gone missing, and give me a call.
the Bancroft case?
Yeah.
looks like a home-invasion homicide, right?
Yes, I'm running dental records now.
cam is finishing up the autopsy.
but Booth is pretty sure it's Terry Bancroft?
Yes.
there was a lot of insect activity.
samples are at your work station.
also, the extension cord used to tie him up and everything that was on top of his desk.
he was tied up?
his heart was perforated, but there's no blood in the thoracic cavity.
he was stabbed after he was already dead.
what, what killed him?
his jugular was punctured.
multiple stabs are congruent with killers jacked on crystal meth or just plain adrenaline.
why kill him?
no sign of forced entry. He probably knew his attackers.
we have a match.
confirmed. Terence Bancroft.
he knew his killers.
are you all right?
Yes.
Yeah, absolutely.
I'll get on insect analysis right away.
yeah? Hey.
Hi, good morning, Angela.
I have blood splatter patterns on my computer, if you need to match them to anything you have here.
uh, yeah, thanks. I'll come take a look after I get through with the evidence from the desk.
you okay? Mm-hmm, yeah.
yeah?
want to have lunch later?
okay, yeah.
what? Do I get to play?
uh, no, you will be cheering and watching.
what fun is that?
I am a mad sagger.
I-I-I wear my shorts very, very low.
you suck hugely at being a girl.
okay, okay, anthropology, anthropology.
Oh, okay, think of it as a social ritual in which I impress you with my manly prowess during a game of basketball.
you want to impress me?
I'm traditional that way.
why don't you just bonk me on the head with a giant club?
I'd much prefer you came to the game and ogled my butt crack.
you know, it's law enforcement versus public defenders;
guys with pony tails and love handles.
we're heavily favored.
so?
Hi, Clarissa.
Jack... I...
you heard about Terry?
can I come in?
last time I saw you, you didn't have a beard.
Yeah, last time you saw me, I couldn't grow a beard.
I'm sorry about Terry.
it makes everything that happened between us look...
meaningless.
at least a lot less important than it seemed at the time.
I got over us, Clarissa.
then how come it took Terry getting murdered for you to show up at our door?
where did you get this?
I work at the Jeffersonian Institution.
I'm on the case.
they showed up with the evidence.
I don't understand.
why are you bringing it to me?
if my bosses were aware that I knew the victim or his wife, they'd remove me from the investigation, and I would really like to help catch whatever son of a ...
murdered my friend.
so someone introduces us...
nice to meet you, Ms. Bancroft.
and you, too,
Dr. Hodgins.
got it.
Terry and I were...
...having some marital problems, but we were getting through it.
that's going to make me a suspect, isn't it?
I can't talk about it, Clarissa.
man, we're really gonna miss that guy around this place.
foot the bill for this place?
Oh, you know, he was more than a checkbook.
I mean, Terry, he took a personal interest.
how personal?
don't even go there, man, all right?
Terry, he was one of the good guys.
these kids are pretty hardcore, huh?
Oh yeah, yeah, you know, drugs, gangs, violence.
any recent arguments or incidents?
well, apparently the night before Terry was gonna head up to his cabin, he caught a kid with a couple pounds of heroin.
a couple pounds?
the kid was a mule.
Yeah, he was running deliveries to Baltimore on the bus.
did you see Bancroft take the drugs from the kid?
no.
how about any of these kids, did they see it?
sure, yeah, you know, until you ask 'em, and then nobody saw nothing.
well, did Bancroft call the police?
Oh, man, come on. We did that, no kid would ever set foot back in this place.
huh. Then what, huh?
flushed it down the toilet?
no, no, it's not like that.
I mean, Terry, he would always deliver whatever he snagged to the cops.
otherwise, the supplier would think they would get ripped off and then the mule ends up dead.
so this... is Julio Diaz' locker.
Oh, blood on the kid's sweatshirt.
no, no, Julio would never kill anybody.
I mean, he might deliver drugs, but he really liked Terry.
maybe Julio's supplier?
when was the last time Julio was here?
the day Terry took the heroin.
all right, look, if it wasn't for Terry Bancroft, this place wouldn't exist.
come on. I need one witness who saw Terry take the dope from Julio Diaz. Just one.
sorry, man.
MONTENEGRO: What is not to like?
go watch Sully play basketball.
he still hasn't made a move on me.
how many times have you gone out?
four or six, depending on how you define "go out."
right. Bumping into each other at the diner does not count as going out.
four. There along the interior cervical vertebrae.
is that shadow a glitch?
I don't do glitches.
four, huh?
so the question is is this Sully damaged goods or is he just very respectful?
those are my choices?
damaged goods, you run away, very respectful, you hang in.
I should just make the first move.
no, Brennan!
for once can you just pretend that you're the girl?
why is everyone so anxious for me to be a girl?
listen, go to the basketball game, let him show off for you, and see what happens.
I don't know. It sounds so passive.
now you've got it.
BOOTH: You just don't get it.
what?
I'm asking for guy advice, you are a guy.
what's not to get? First of all, guys, they don't ask for advice and secondly,
I'm not going to help you get my partner into bed. Why not?
it's not like you want her.
unless...
do you want her?
Nah, come on, huh? Bones is, you know...
she's my partner. Oh...
that is why you need psychiatric treatment, because you have the hots for your partner.
I'm not in psychiatric treatment.
okay? It's an evaluation.
big difference.
I can tell that Brennan is the go-slow type, but you gotta help me out on how slow, because too slow is worse than not slow enough.
agent Booth? Yeah?
district cops got a kid matching your APB down at the morgue.
man: John Doe number120806, male, approximately 14 years old.
his body was found under the Anacostia Bridge on the sixth.
that was almost 20 days ago.
I-I-I think that's Julio.
that's definitely his gold chain, for sure.
cause of death?
single gunshot wound to the back of the head.
execution style.
Yeah, if, uh...
if Terry hadn't gotten the drugs to the cops, the supplier would've come after Julio.
Terry Bancroft got killed for that heroin.
Dr. Brennan saw a shadow on the X-rays.
I removed the tissue from the bones and found a fungus. Not odd.
if you were decomposing for three weeks, you'd probably work up a fungus or two as well.
the interior cervical vertebrae.
spell it out, bone-boy.
the jugular was cut and the blood pooled here.
he was lying on his back for several hours.
BOOTH: Anything new?
Yes.
the victim was killed by the puncturing of his jugular, left lying there for several hours, then the murderer came back.
forced the body into his chair.
and stabbed him 14 more times.
Oh, to make it look like a home invasion.
the blood on Julio's sweatshirt found in the locker was definitely Bancroft's.
well, that doesn't make sense.
Bancroft confiscates the kid's dope, kid runs to the supplier, they go to Bancroft's place, scare him into telling them where the dope is, then kill him.
only that doesn't scan. I mean, why murder the kid?
cause he was there. 'Cause he cried.
cause he blew his nose on a red hankie.
they don't need much reason. Well, I don't like it.
doesn't mean it's not true.
Hodgins: Calliphora vomitoria.
Prepupal stage of the third instar.
does that give us a postmortem interval?
18. 5 days.
whoa, whoa, you can be that accurate from flies?
doj Forensics has new statistical models of maggot growth to pinpoint death within a six-hour window.
hmm. Then I was right.
about what? Julio Diaz was killed 20 days ago.
18. 5 days ago is after his body was found.
then how did Bancroft's blood get on Julio's sweatshirt?
Julio Diaz was dead under that bridge.
Sully's looking good. Hot.
you know, Scotty says Sully won't shower with the other guys.
that guy's got some kind of an issue.
guys only got one kind of issue, girl.
then I guess we know why they call him Peanut.
Ah, in point of fact, it is therapy.
what? No. No, it's not. It's an evaluation.
no, I've already certified you as fit to carry a gun and go back to work.
okay, then why are we meeting?
well, because you discharged your weapon at an ice cream truck.
my provisional certification of your mental health only holds as long as you continue to meet with me.
great. For how long?
till I'm satisfied that you won't start firing at confectioners again.
what's your objection to therapy?
you know what, Doc? I am not the kind of guy who's got anything to hide.
do you know I often find that when people declare what they are not, it almost invariably turns out that's precisely what they are.
great. Then you know what?
no more declarations for me.
you do know what you just said is, in fact, the very avatar of a declaration? Avatar?
that's great. Can I get a cup of coffee and a, uh...
tea, please. Tea.
let me ask you a question, Doc.
why is it that every time you introduce yourself you always say your name twice huh?
: "hello, my name is Gordon, Gordon Wyatt."
well, now you're simply lashing out, aren't you?
why don't we talk about the case you're working on at the moment? What?
well, I am trained as a forensic psychiatrist. I might be able to help.
okay, fine. Great.
I have a dead rich guy, works with at-risk youth, gets brutally murdered after confiscating a couple pounds of heroin from one of his kids.
interesting the first word you used to describe him is "rich."
Ah, second. First description was "dead."
why do you think you have a problem with wealthy people?
this case, a perfect example.
this guy, he makes up his own rules.
what's that word that you used?
entitled. Yeah, entitled.
that's what got him killed.
now did this rich guy, by any chance, have a wife?
Oh, what, are we changing the subject now?
and does the rich guy's wife have a lover?
I just told you.
the murder has to do with the heroin.
the boy the victim took the heroin from also turned up murdered.
and is this boy from a modest background?
doesn't get any modester.
so is there any chance that you would rather catch the boy's murderer than the wealthy fellow's murderer, so you have decided that they are one and the same?
any chance that you've based this assumption purely on your bias against rich, entitled people?
you know what?
I did the belt buckle, I did the tie, I did the socks, what else do you want from me?
what would you say if I told you that my name actually is Gordon Gordon Wyatt?
that my first and middle names are the same?
Yeah, baby! WOMAN: See you there?
I'll see you at the restaurant. Okay.
I'll go get Scotty.
: so, you ready to go?
don't you want to take a shower?
eh, I don't sweat that much.
won't you be uncomfortable at the restaurant?
it's a skuzzy bar.
I'll be one of the best smelling things there.
next to you, of course.
you played very well.
thank you.
in fact, you were the best.
see, that's why I wanted you to come.
you know, to be impressed.
it was an impressive display of manhood.
well, thank you.
athletics as an analog for battle.
in effect, you were a warrior tonight.
Wow. You really were impressed.
there are quite a number of ways that men judge their relative maleness with respect to other men. Uh-huh.
muscles.
income. Cars.
attractive mates. Tolerance to alcohol.
hair loss. And, of course, the size of the sexual organ.
save something for us to discuss at dinner.
well... women don't care about that.
dinner? Or-Or hair loss?
the size of the sexual organ.
ours or yours?
penis size only matters to other males.
see, I was hoping you'd comment on how I shut down the other team's offense.
well, their offense wasn't really all that good.
Oh, you know how to hurt a guy.
it's not a bad thing. I like it.
a little sauce, a little zing.
okay, the flake on the trachea was India Ink.
it came from this.
it's a scrimshawed letter opener.
wiped clean, but there are still minute traces of Terence Bancroft's blood in the etchings.
I need to pull a little con on the wife.
your wife? No, the victim's wife.
Why?
to find out if she was cheating on her husband.
I thought the murder was because of the heroin.
well, it is, but, you know,
I need you to come along and, you know, collect some dust or pollen or seeds or whatever the hell it is you do so I can get in and figure out if she's got anything to hide.
how will you do that?
Oh, got my ways. Come on.
wow, you know, I'm really busy here with the murder weapon.
Plus, you found a fiber in the victim's throat.
it's actually muskrat.
muskrat, hey, that's a perfect cover. We'll go to the mansion, you go inside and look for anything made out of muskrat. Come on.
why are you dragging your feet? Let's go.
I'll... I'll get my kit.
Yeah, get your kit.
good evening, Ms. Bancroft.
this is, uh... Dr. Hodgins from the Jeffersonian.
I was wondering if... Very pleased to meet you.
nice to meet you, Dr. Hodgins. Clarissa Bancroft.
Dr. Hodgins, uh, needs to take a look inside in the den, if that's all right.
uh, what are you looking for?
muskrat.
how long will Dr. Hodgins be in there?
well, you know, a homicide investigation is pretty invasive.
the family and the victim, they lose all their privacy.
I understand.
do you?
because, uh... it's inevitable that we find out everything.
what kind of doctor is Jack?
bugs. Slime.
there's fancier names, but that's about it.
you know, don't you?
you know that I had an affair.
it's best you tell me everything.
it ended three months ago.
Terry and I were working through it.
separate vacations?
I didn't say it wasn't difficult.
you can love someone and still hurt them.
you need his name?
Yeah. Leland Oliver.
he's our financial consultant.
if you'd divorced your husband...
I would've gotten, at most, half of his money. This way, I get it all.
Leland knew that better than anyone.
that's exactly why
I didn't say anything earlier.
how did you know Dr. Hodgins' first name?
you introduced us.
I never said his first name.
just tell him, Clarissa.
all right, look, I'm sorry.
but it doesn't change anything.
Hey, this is not a problem.
not a problem? Not a problem, huh?
I ought to arrest you for tampering with evidence.
this goes to trial, you're in Ibiza or Antarctica on vacation.
start looking for another job.
Hodgins, what is the significance of the muskrat fur?
Yeah, Hodgins, what is the significance of the muskrat fur?
muskrats have an under layer of fur;
the outer layer is coarse hair.
this is muskrat hair.
fur, hair...
I doubt our victim's jugular was cut by a muskrat.
is there something going on?
you want to tell them?
the muskrat hair was colored with a new dye that's just been patented by a menswear company in Canada.
so the murderer was dressed in one of these jackets?
BOOTH: Wait a second...
that one.
brennan: The leather bomber with muskrat liner.
BOOTH: That's the one Robert Fraiser was wearing.
the director of the youth drop-in center.
then we have our murderer.
good job, Hodgins.
not "Good job, Hodgins."
he might have blown the whole case.
I told him it is not a problem.
brennan: What happened?
I don't care what he does in his time off, but when he screws around with evidence to get in the pants of an old girlfriend on one of my murder cases?
watch JULIAN: I already got no proof how the victim got hold of that heroin.
now you're saying I can't put Hodgins on the stand? Why?
you don't want to know the answer to that.
why doesn't she want to know?
as the prosecutor in this case,
I'm obliged to share everything I know with the defense.
just because Clarissa Bancroft and I...
whoa.
good night.
did you not hear what she just said?
there are some things she can't know.
clarissa and I were engaged.
she and Terry started something up and...
it unfolded the way those things do.
I haven't contacted or heard from either of them in eight years.
then Terry got killed...
and like every other rich guy in the world, you decided the rules just didn't apply to you.
Hey, the guy used to be my friend, all right? And Clarissa...
you tampered with evidence.
the glass and frame were evidence.
the photograph I removed was not.
I wanted to work Terry's murder.
obviously, you're off the case.
he should be off the job.
that is not your decision, Booth.
I apologize.
I will deal with this however you see fit.
JULIAN: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my good friend, Mr. Barron, is going to give you a long speech about what "reasonable doubt" is.
he's mostly going to be right.
but facts are facts, ladies and gentlemen, and the fact is Mr. Robert Fraiser killed Mr. Terence Bancroft for a few pounds of heroin.
they've got anthropologists and psychiatrists and particulate experts and blood experts, the whole weight of the Jeffersonian Institution, all interpreting the facts for you.
and I stress the word "interpret."
because you, as the jury, are the arbiters of common sense that gets lost in all the science.
would you describe how the victim was killed?
Mr. Bancroft died when a sharp instrument was thrust into his jugular.
ADDY: This is a dried fleck of India ink left in the victim's trachea.
it matches the ink on a scrimshaw letter opener the FBI found at the scene.
postmortem, the vicious attack on the victim continued.
objection. Categorization of the attack as "vicious" is prejudicial.
14 times a man was stabbed.
how many stabs does it take to be vicious, exactly?
sustained.
using a 2-D image from a stereomicroscope,
I was able to create a three-dimensional model.
these kerf marks are congruent with a double-edged blade, one side serrated, the other not.
Yeah, that's the knife we found in the toolbox in Robert Frasier's truck.
that would explain the prints found by the FBI forensics lab?
it would explain the prints, but not the victim's blood.
Yeah, this is the jacket Robert Frasier was wearing at the time of his arrest.
brennan: The hair on the left came from the victim's larynx, the hair on the right came from the jacket.
and they came from the same jacket?
they came from the same muskrat.
how did this hair get into the victim's larynx?
the larynx and the trachea were both punctured by the murder weapon.
and that was most logically achieved by the murderer approaching the victim from behind, putting a choke hold on him, and plunging the murder weapon into his throat.
in doing so, the murderer inadvertently stabbed through his own jacket, thus depositing the muskrat hair in the victim's throat.
JULIAN: Let the record show that that witness is wiggling his finger through the jacket in a very convincing manner.
objection to the use of the phrase "very convincing manner."
sustained.
Why?
why what?
why was Terence Bancroft killed?
did you discover a motive, Agent Booth?
I need five minutes, Your Honor.
look, man, I saw Terry take the dope from Julio.
I don't see how that's going to help burn Frasier, though.
it's called chain of evidence.
it'll help, okay? Trust me.
I'll say what I saw.
Terry was a good man.
so are you.
come on, let's go.
Terry was, like, "Open that bag, Julio."
JULIAN: What did Julio do?
he just stood there.
Terry went over, took the bag from him.
he opened it up
it was packed with pounds of blast.
tell the jury what that means.
heroin.
at least two bricks.
and like, everybody knows what happens if Terry catches you holding
you get sent out for 72 hours.
and the drugs?
straight to the police.
you believe Robert Frasier killed Terence Bancroft for that heroin?
Yes. Robert Frasier turned out to be a junkie.
that's why he wore that jacket all the time.
objection. Assuming facts not in evidence.
what do you mean?
the defendant has every needle disease in the book except HIV.
same objection.
Plus, Ms. Julian seems to deeply desire to testify herself.
Yes, I would like to testify, because then I'd know what answers I was getting.
judge: All right, settle down.
this is a murder trial, not a night at the Improv.
the victim was killed and left for between ten and 15 hours.
the murderer returned and forced him into the chair.
this is also when he was stabbed 14 times.
that ten to 15 hours gave the murderer time to soak Julia Diaz' sweatshirt in the victim's blood, in order to put the blame on either Mr. Diaz or the drug suppliers.
but you do not believe that the defendant killed the boy.
no, but he might as well have.
Objection!
I'll hear it.
Terence Bancroft intended to give that heroin to the police, in order to keep Julio Diaz square with his suppliers.
thank you.
Julio Diaz was 14 years old.
your Honor...
the prosecution apologizes,
your Honor.
and rests.
MONTENEGRO: Wait.
you still haven't slept together?
I know the problem.
: his religious upbringing?
his penis.
what's wrong with it?
apparently, it's small.
Oh, well, that maybe explains why he hasn't made any moves on you yet.
he's insecure.
so, I should make the first move, right?
Yeah.
take Sully for a little test drive.
maybe he's got unlimited mileage.
that'll make up for the fact that he's a subcompact.
BOOTH: Hey, Doc, what we're doing here, would that be considered therapy?
Oh, absolutely, especially as I'm about to inquire whether you've experienced any outbursts of temper since I requested you alter your dress code.
Yeah, one of the, uh, the squints-- Hodgins
decided the rules, they didn't apply to him.
he got entitled and jeopardized my murder case.
Ah, and you confronted him physically?
physical confrontation-- that's my main skill.
entitled, you said.
is he a wealthy man?
Yeah, like the guy who got killed.
the murder victim who... he tried to help a child and then died for it?
and your...
squint? Yeah, squint.
: extraordinary.
your squint tried to help a friend?
so they both endeavored to do good.
with no clue of the way things are.
the way things are as defined by a working-class lad from Pittsburgh.
that's right.
where I'm from, all right, from the streets where you get a sense of how the world really is.
Yes, I'm sure that's true, but has it occurred to you that without the distortion of reality provided by a privileged upbringing, there'd be no such thing as the Sistine Chapel, the Taj Mahal or Three Rivers Stadium, home of your beloved Steelers?
three Rivers Stadium was demolished in 2000.
it really was a great place, though. I mean, that Lambert...
no doubt. The point is...
you rebel in your way, your friend rebels in his.
we, all of us, have to overcome our upbringings, rich and poor alike.
you know what?
I'm going to ask you to go back to your bilious socks and your ostentatious ties and your provocative belt buckles.
Oh, you're saying if I wear flashy socks,
I'm gonna forgive Hodgins?
I'm not sure I'm that good, but, well, perhaps I am, hmm.
Oh, hey, Doc, Doc, Doc, uh...
w-why is it that the, uh, the belt buckle is provocative?
Oh, it's a modern-day codpiece.
it forces the eye to the groin.
BARRON: What process was used to match the India ink on the letter opener with the flake in the victim's trachea?
hydropneumatic elutriation.
BARRON: Which involves dissolving the sample in a solution, correct?
Yes.
essentially destroying it?
Yes.
and how was the muskrat hair processed?
liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry.
and did you perform this test personally, Dr. Saroyan?
no, it was done by a specialist at the Jeffersonian.
and who might that be?
SAROYAN: Dr. Jack Hodgins.
the same man who used flies to estimate the time of death?
Yes.
the same Dr. Jack Hodgins who was once engaged to the victim's wife, Clarissa Bancroft?
Objection! Assumes facts not in evidence.
sustained.
quite right, Your Honor.
the defense calls Dr. Jack Hodgins to the stand, after which, we will be moving for a dismissal of all charges.
Hodgins and Clarissa Bancroft?
that's a classic defense move.
you just check out the wife for motive, run through the ex-lovers.
well, the judge didn't dismiss the case, which is a miracle.
better you don't know, Caroline.
I figured it was something small like a typo in a search warrant but, no, turns out Hodgins had motive to kill the man himself.
eight years ago, maybe, but not now.
I've got Angela.
hello. If I might continue.
the judge has allowed you 24 hours to come up with additional evidence that has never been seen, heard, smelled, touched or considered by Dr. Hodgins.
24 hours.
Hodgins was all over this case.
we need something brand-new, or something that Hodgins didn't touch.
both weapons, blood spatter evidence...
trace evidence from the scene, the heroin, the sweatshirt.
I mean, we've covered it all.
the answer is here, in front of us, just like always.
the fungus.
SAROYAN: What fungus?
the fungus Zack found along the interior cervical vertebrae.
typical cadaver mold.
brennan: Let's have it identified.
that would usually be Hodgins' job.
not this time.
it's my letter of resignation.
your science was dead-on perfect.
that's all I care about.
I don't need your resignation.
he didn't actually tamper with evidence.
Dr. Hodgins endangered a case by hiding his relationship with a suspect.
I'm saving Dr. Saroyan the trouble of firing me.
well, how much trouble is it?
you're fired!
that's no trouble at all.
a child could do it.
I appreciate it.
so we all agree it's aspergillus?
ADDY: But there are 185 strains of aspergillus.
Clavatus?
Glaucus? Flavus?
and they all look totally alike to me.
no, no, these two are different.
I don't see it.
well, they're both... puddly.
Puddly?
well, by "puddly" I mean the hyphae are septate and hyaline and the conidiophores originate from the basal foot cell located on the supporting hyphae and terminate in a vesicle.
aspergillus ustus.
you found it.
exactly how much time have you been spending with Hodgins?
pie good?
I quit.
handed in my letter to Cam.
idiot.
should've got fired.
now... no severance package.
I figure, a guy like you,
I resign, that puts things right between us.
do we need to discuss it past that?
what are we... girls?
piece of pie for my friend.
JULIAN: I will remind the jury that they have heard previous testimony from Dr. Clifford Lonsdale, a clinical expert in drug addiction.
why should the jury care about some Latin infections?
we found a fungus on the victim called Aspergillus ustus.
is that not very common?
the fungus in the victim matches exactly the strain Dr. Lonsdale found in the defendant.
what are the chances of that occurring?
incalculable.
which is something I've never said before.
ms. Montenegro, how did this happen?
when the defendant punctured the victim's jugular, he nicked himself.
thus introducing the bacteria directly into the victim's blood stream.
the fungus developed only where blood from the fatal stab pooled.
here, along the spinal cord.
it did not spread throughout the body.
which means?
that only Mr. Fraiser could have infected the victim and only within moments of the victim's death.
and who found this fungus?
brennan: Dr. Zack Addy.
and who identified it?
brennan: Ms. Angela Montenegro.
and who realized the significance of it?
I did.
BARRON: Dr. Jack Hodgins participated in no way whatsoever?
Objection!
the implication is offensive.
that objection has no standing in law, Ms. Julian.
the witness will answer.
despite the fact that I have absolute faith in Dr. Hodgins' integrity and objectivity, in this instance, he was not involved.
then the evidence stands.
I don't see how they can do that.
who? Lawyers.
do what?
brennan: Be all friendly.
SAROYAN: The only people lawyers like are other lawyers.
well, they were married.
well, they have a daughter, second year at M. I.T.
does anyone else see the irony here?
listen up, you people.
the verdict is going to come down any minute.
maybe we'll win, maybe we'll lose, but this I do know.
you people have got to get your sand together, you hear me?
booth and you scientist- android brainiacs, you got something very special here.
but you are losing it
dropping serial killers off balconies and blabbing suspects' names to vengeful fathers, cutting into heads before their times, getting poisoned, getting blown up because you go grabbing for things you shouldn't ought, taking photographs from frames, getting a perfectly good car smashed to bits for no good reason!
get it together!
start using your oversized heads.
this is the real world.
now... I know bug man here handed in his resignation.
my official Justice Department recommendation is the following:
we win the case, he gets his job back.
we lose,
booth shoots him.
the jury's returned with a verdict.
okay, let's go face the music.
will the defendant please rise?
Madame Foreperson, please read the verdict.
FOREPERSON: We, the jury, find the defendant guilty.
judge: This court is adjourned.
you look happy.
you look really happy.
you made the first move.
you told me I should.
how was it?
I mean, I don't mean "it."
no, no, I do. I mean "it."
I discovered something very interesting about cops and nicknames.
anthropologically interesting?
anatomically interesting.
they call the bald guy "Curly"
and the fat guy "Tiny."
it's ironic.
so when they call Sully "Peanut..."
he doesn't like to shower with the other guys because he diverges from the quantifiable morphological norm.
what? What's that mean?
stands out from a crowd.
do you have a nickname, Booth?
something the other cops call you.
Why? What have you heard?
congrats, Brennan.
those socks, those are amazing. That's right.
the socks, the tie, the belt buckle-- all escape valves for my socioeconomic rage.
I hate psychology.
well, you know, they help me deal with the day-to-day irritations of dealing with people that are more privileged.
I slept with Sully last night.
Oh, I thought you already...
no.
last night.
Oh, it's really none of my business.
except we're partners.
Yeah, there's that.
and you told me about your socks.
sex, socks-- pretty much the same word.
do we have a case, or are you just visiting?
Yeah, I'll fill you in on the way.
it's messy.
better get some protection.
let me get my gum boots.
okay. Dr. Brennan, Agent Booth.
together. A little closer.
okay, yeah, that's perfect.
beautiful.
now keeping your back straight,
I want you each to lean forward.
no.
excuse me? - Come on, Booth.
I'm sure this is just one of those meaningless exercises meant to illustrate the importance of supporting each other.
we agreed to see another therapist, not be action figures for a 12-year-old.
I'm 22, Agent Booth.
I have a doctorate in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania, where my dissertation on the effects of job stress was published.
that's great. I'm sure mom is really proud of you, Sweets.
Dr. Sweets, or Lance, you know, if you're more comfortable with informality, but I'd prefer, out of respect for each other and the process of psychotherapy, that we at least try to, uh...
sign the forms so I can get out of this suit and I could have a Saturday night.
I don't care how young you are.
I've never believed in psychotherapy.
Mm...
agent Booth, Dr. Brennan, this isn't a game.
the FBI is considering severing your partnership.
what?
Why? - Why?
dude, you arrested her father.
he was just doing his job.
Yeah, but come on, he, like, he arrested your father.
he's going to have to be a witness against him.
circumstances such as these tend to stir up a lot of scary feelings.
I don't have scary feelings.
maybe you need a little night-light at night to sleep.
agent Booth, you've been trying to intimidate me since the moment you stepped in here.
and you've succeeded. - Don't...
scare the boy, Booth.
now, I need you both to, uh, fill out these questionnaires and get 'em back to me.
don't share your answers.
it'll help me evaluate whether Dr. Brennan's services signed to a new agent.
that's not going to happen.
like it or not, Agent Booth,
I'm the therapist in charge of this case, so I suggest that we work in cooperation rather than conflict.
I can cooperate.
good.
agent Booth?
I'm still going to call you Sweets.
Yep.
it's some kind of personality test.
I can't believe he gave us homework.
you know, probably his.
what kind of kid works on a Saturday night?
Oh, that's my fault.
I told him I wasn't available during the week.
whoa, whoa, why'd you go and do that?
you know, I had, I had seats right behind the dugout.
booth.
don't look on my paper.
okay, yeah, got it.
well, there's only one thing more fun than therapy on a Saturday night and that's a dead body.
look at all the cars.
I thought the VA hospital was closed.
well, it is, Bones, but I mean, come on.
it's the weekend, right?
an abandoned building surrounded by acres of secluded land.
use your imagination.
teenagers, hormones.
you're saying they're here to fornicate.
Yes. Nice image, very, uh, biblical.
these two were on their way to a romantic encounter under the stars and literally tripped over the remains.
Oh, I'm guessing that killed the mood.
I've got patchy tissue.
but this level of decomp...
pushes things into your territory.
I haven't touched it yet.
definitely not homeless-- nice watch, good shoes, at least what's left of them.
male, middle-aged.
level of decomp would suggest he's been out here a few weeks, but...
I don't get it.
kids coming here every night and they're just noticing him now...
dumped at the top of the hill?
and he rolled down.
would explain the amount of fresh mud and leaves on the body.
these bones are still greasy.
did you take an internal temperature?
with this degree of decomp, why would it matter?
maybe he hasn't been dead as long as he looks.
the body is still radiating a lot of heat.
wow, you're not kidding.
we used to use the local golf course.
I remember taking Mary Ann Milano to the ninth hole-- sand trap.
she had long hair all the way back to...
you are so going to regret telling this story.
okay, now what do you got?
127 degrees?
wow, that's really not normal.
no, that's way past really not normal.
you're saying that before the body was dumped it was...
cooked. - Cooked?
cooked.
has it occurred to either of you that this might be another victim in the Widow's Son case?
based on what?
there's no evidence here to suggest cannibalism
no bite marks. - No condiments.
we have a bullet hole in the sternum, Dr. Brennan.
what guy in Germany?
he ran a computer ad online, said he was looking for someone to eat.
there's an excessive amount of mud and debris from the dump site.
it makes it difficult to get a clear view of the injury.
Yeah, tell me about it.
I have to separate and distinguish particulates and insects from the body's original location.
people actually replied to the ad?
Oh, yeah.
guy ended up feasting on a computer engineer.
that's extremely disturbing.
well, hello, my exotic princess.
what a charmingly inappropriate greeting, Dr. Hodgins.
I think he's talking to a bug.
well, now I feel a bit...
rejected.
looks like something from the Nitidulidae family.
where did you come from, you gorgeous creature?
do you have any friends?
boy, he melted like ice cream on a hot summer day.
so when do I get my turn with him?
Oh, we should be finished within 20 minutes.
excellent.
Wow.
I'm finding a large concentration of bristletails and harvester ants dead by the victim's feet.
that is odd.
the guy was cooked, Hodgins.
odd is kind of a relative term.
Hey.
angela called. She wanted me to...
Hey, is that the test from Dr. Sweets?
Yes.
well, what'd you put for number seven?
because I put 12 to 15 times a day, and now I'm thinking I really misunderstood the question.
we're not supposed to discuss our answers. - Come on,
bones, the teacher's not in the room, let me see.
is this how you got through school, Booth?
no. Well, maybe algebra, but...
Hey, Booth, I got your I. D.
Franklin Curtis, age 54.
his wife Margie reported him missing yesterday.
whoa... Augusta county. He was rich. - Yeah.
founder of the Natural Sun organic supermarket chain.
there's one near my apartment.
excellent selection of local produce.
totally overpriced.
a carrot is a carrot.
Hey, it's worth it.
organic, there's no pesticides.
it's from sustainable farms.
every time that I buy something there, I feel so virtuous.
guy started off with a single roadside produce stand, which he grew into a nationwide supermarket chain.
an organic capitalist.
ambition like that is bound to create a few enemies.
I tested fabric samples from the victim's pants.
they were covered with chloropicrin.
why the pinchy face, Bones?
Franklin Curtis built his whole career on organic produce and chloropicrin...
is a pesticide.
I was at a yoga retreat with my daughter.
when Frank didn't answer the phone, I got worried.
here, Mom.
Ignatia Amara.
it's a homeopathic remedy for grief.
when we came home, there was a cup of herbal tea on the counter as if he'd just...
stepped out for a moment.
I noticed the fields as we drove in.
you still operate the farm?
no matter how big the business got,
dad always wanted to remember how it all started.
your farm, it's...
certified organic, correct?
no pesticides besides natural predators?
of course.
your husband, was he having any personal problems, recent arguments?
no, everybody loved Frank.
mom.
your dad was a wonderful man.
my dad was kind of obsessed.
he'd pressure conventional farmers to go organic.
"pressure" makes it sound so...
he was an extremely generous man.
he offered to support them financially, while they made the transition.
what if a farmer didn't want to switch?
dad would turn things over to his lawyers.
they'd find some legal loophole.
property taxes, zoning, who knows?
eventually Dad would just buy them out.
and he'd force people off their land.
I see.
any farmers he was trying to convert?
Yeah, Mr. Harding?
something I can help you with?
Yeah, FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.
this here is my partner Dr. Temperance Brennan.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Franklin Curtis.
you can tell that son of a bitch that the only crop that will ever grow in this land is tobacco.
I don't give a crap how many suits he sends over here to scare me.
he, he didn't send us, Mr. Harding.
Franklin Curtis is dead.
well,
I wish I could muster up some remorse.
Wow.
no love lost between the two of you, I see.
the man was trying to kick me off of my own land.
my family has been on this farm for over 150 years.
tobacco built this country, yet these self-righteous eco-hippies have the nerve to look down their nose at us.
did you see Frank last Thursday?
n-not that I can recall. - Really?
because Virginia Pesticide Control Board reports that you registered an application of chloropicrin to your field last Thursday, the same day Frank disappeared.
so? It's a fumigant insecticide. It's perfectly legal.
it was all over Frank's clothing.
all... over.
okay, he did come over.
he said he was giving me one last chance before he started playing dirty.
I was spraying the fields.
I may have accidentally aimed the chem hose at him.
accidentally. - Look, I swear I wasn't trying to hurt him.
I just wanted him off my property.
you understand?
who the hell was he to take my land from me?
I'm just saying the guy had a point.
if pesticides are so bad for us, then how come people live longer now than they did before they used pesticides?
you're over-simplifying an enormously complex issue.
meaning you don't have a good answer.
the arguments in favor of organic farming aren't just about food safety.
they're about prevention of soil erosion, protection of water quality, carbon emissions from shipping, not to mention...
whatever, you know what, you're not going to see me paying four dollars for a tomato.
you know, a researcher at the University of Florida proved that alligators who swim in pesticide contaminated waters have smaller genitalia than their clean-water counterparts.
no way.
way.
see?
right there.
there's some kind of pattern on what's left of the skin tissue.
I'm hoping a more artistic eye than mine can make sense of it.
regular circular shapes, cross-hatching,
I'd say button marks.
like buttons from the victim's shirt were pressed into his flesh while he decomposed.
Yes, that's exactly what they are.
glad to help.
here's the thing, though.
our victim's clothing doesn't have any buttons.
Yeah, in this whole environmental footprint thing, right, I mean, why shouldn't I leave a footprint?
I'm here, right?
Hey, why should I have fewer rights than any other species?
Hey, Bones, you know we're having a lively discussion here.
tobacco has to be cured.
Yeah, I know, and it kills you.
we're on the same side with that one.
curing at tobacco farms is done in curing barns, using indirect fired burners.
Oh, so if Frank's body were in Harding's curing barn, that would explain how it got cooked.
Brennan.
that should be enough to get a warrant to search the farm.
there's what?
skin slippage.
our victim was pressed up against another body and during whatever heating process the two went through, the second corpse's tissue basically melted onto our victim.
Thanks. - What, we got big news from the nerd posse?
when we search the tobacco farm, we'll be looking for more than the murder site.
we'll be looking for a second victim.
I'm making lemonade.
lemonade!
it's awful hot today.
it's an intrusion, Elizabeth, not a garden party.
agent Booth, ma'am.
Elizabeth Harding. - Pleasure to meet you.
listen, we won't be any longer than we have to.
shame about Mr. Curtis.
uh, we don't have to talk to them, Elizabeth.
don't mind Mr. Grouchy.
did you know Mr. Curtis personally?
Oh, of course.
although, maybe not as personally as he might have liked.
how's that?
Andy didn't tell you?
no. - Oh, he gets so jealous. No reason.
looks aren't everything.
Mr. Curtis was a big flirt.
always making passes at me.
it didn't seem relevant.
and right under his poor wife's nose, too.
fool thought he could get me to convince Andy to sell the farm.
Elizabeth...! - Oh, don't you start again.
when I told Andy, I don't think I have ever seen him so mad.
what a temper you have.
thank you, Mrs. Harding.
you have been very helpful.
tell Andy.
he doesn't think I can do anything right.
so how many lemonades?
Oh, how many lemonades?
make a pitcher. Great.
put solar panels on my house.
compact fluorescents in every socket and still feel guilty when I use a paper napkin.
I've been looking at low-impact housing.
I saw a free-standing house that was 118 square feet.
this entry to the sternum might not be a bullet hole.
wait, wait, wait.
118 square feet?
dude, that's smaller than the janitor's closet.
there's room for a bed, kitchen on one wall and a small bathroom.
I don't really see why I would need more.
isn't the goal to reduce our impact on the environment?
our lives aren't only about function.
we are allowed to enjoy ourselves occasionally.
that's why I work.
Yes, finally. Identified my mystery bug.
Carpophilus nitidulidae. King of the lab!
it's an agricultural pest, found on pineapple plants.
agent Booth?
there's nothing, the curing shed is clean.
Yeah, but the body was cooked, and there should be another body, too.
not here.
more lemonade?
Yes, please.
no, no, no, just go back inside and check.
I'll take half a glass.
Thanks.
booth.
he was around pineapple plants at the time of his death.
pineapples?
Hodgins found insect activity that's only found on pineapple plants.
but the closest place they're grown commercially is Florida.
you're saying that the body was moved from Florida?
I don't have an explanation, I'm just giving you the facts.
I found this article about the environmental impact caused by transporting crops over long distances.
it mentions this farmer in Virginia who was trying to grow tropical crops in a hot house.
like pineapples?
like pineapples.
Thanks.
Thanks.
boy, sorry to hear about Frank.
he was a good man.
a big supporter of what I'm trying to do here.
all right, Mr. Paige... - Please, call me Lyndon.
you ever eat a pineapple the same day it was picked, Agent Booth.
actually, no, and...
let me make you each a smoothie. - That's okay.
I'd love one.
Frank Curtis ever visit your hot house?
once, back when I first built it.
he had some advice on how to maximize sun exposure.
what's he doing?
he's powering the blender.
the wheel rim is attached to a generator.
this is rather ingenious. - Stay fit and save energy.
everyone should do it. - I'm sure it'll catch on; so, you and Frank, you ever have any problems?
no, never.
probably helped that I didn't have a wife for him to flirt with.
seems Frank had a habit of hitting on other people's wives.
all great men have their foibles.
go ahead and check out the hot house.
I'll bring these out soon as they're done.
Frank Curtis's wife stood to gain the most from her husband's death.
if she found out he was cheating...
but you said her alibi is solid.
that doesn't mean we can't, you know, double check.
I bet Sweets was picked on all through school.
and that's relevant now, why?
you're kidding me, right?
scrawny kid like that sees me coming, a former jock, and he's thinking to himself, "Time for a little payback," you know?
make him fill out all those stupid forms.
threatens to take my partner away from me.
these tubs are too small to fit anything.
we're not going to find the second victim here.
Yeah, you know what, you're right.
so what do you say we go check...
bones, was that you?
was what me?
that smell.
I don't know what you're talking about. - Come on.
why don't girls just admit it?
it's a natural bodily function.
you're a scientist.
booth, I don't...
that had to be you. - It wasn't me!
he who smelt it, dealt it. - How do you even know that phrase?
phew, sorry about that smell.
guess I left the vents open.
community composting facility is about a mile away, but when the winds blow westerly, it smells like it's around the corner.
do you take agricultural wastes to the composting facility?
sure, almost every organic farmer in the county does.
it's a great program.
you give them your waste and in return, they give you certified organic compost at a fraction of the cost.
whoa, I wasn't done with that. - I have an idea.
thank you very much, Lyndon.
your smoothies are excellent.
Hey, hey, hey, do you have any "to go" cups?
the road to the apocalypse is paved with disposable food containers, my friend.
compost, of course.
the identifying organisms would have started dying as soon as the body was removed from the heat.
but how high do the temperatures get?
inside a large compost heap, as high as 170 degrees.
that's hot enough to cook a body.
and if Lyndon contributes his waste to the pile, that could explain why the pineapple beetle was there.
Hey, you guys going to check out a large compost pile?
it's wrong how excited he sounds.
we've got five people on staff full time.
but there's 43 farmers with keys to the gates.
you all right? - Yeah
Oh, just the smell.
we've probably got a couple masks in the office, - you two want me to go... - I'm fine.
agent Booth tends to be squeamish.
look, I'm fine, okay?
so you were saying 43 farmers?
they're welcome to dump their own waste, otherwise we schedule a pickup with our truck when it's ?
Aw, it's right.
Hey, Gavin. - Wooh, Tim Peck,
clay Ainsley, couple of our local farmers.
this is Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan.
they're here about Frank.
truck stopped running again, Gavin.
I think it needs a new fuel filter.
I just replaced it two weeks ago.
Yeah, when I switched to bio-diesel,
I went through at least four fuel filters.
it's a conversion, loosens up the deposits. - You work here?
Yes, sir. Charlie Rogan.
did you know Frank Curtis?
very well.
I only just heard what happened to him.
I dated his daughter all through high school.
Gavin introduced us.
if there's anything I can do...
Mr. Curtis was a great man.
Oh, you disagree?
Frank Curtis was in it for the money, not the cause.
then why did he donate his entire estate to environmental groups?
we're talking millions.
even our corp could see some. - You ever been to his house?
4, 000 square feet, brand-new everything.
left his air conditioner on all the time.
Yeah, fat lot that man cared about the environment.
don't mind him.
the smell out here always puts him in a foul mood.
look, I'm going to need names and addresses of every employee-- god...
and a list of participating farmers.
and the facility has to be closed until all of the compost is searched.
we can get a warrant if you want.
I do.
two independent people often find themselves...
agent Booth, are you listening?
what?
the judge will call when the warrant is issued,
booth, pay attention.
what, I'm in the middle of an investigation.
I get distracted. So it's not my investigation, too?
it's too early in the morning for this.
no, no, no, this is good, let's talk about conflict.
when you guys argue, how do you come to a resolution?
we don't argue. Come on, remember, zone of truth, right here. Fine.
we might bicker a little bit, but that's not arguing. Bicker?
I don't bicker. No?
what about the whole environmentalism thing?
that was a discussion. You pretty much told me my penis was going to shrink if I didn't eat organic food.
that's not bickering, that's being a good friend.
my penis is just fine, thank you.
now we're getting somewhere.
all right, I think we're in that truth zone.
stop with the whole truth zone thing. All right.
bones and I are trying to catch a guy who cooked a tree hugger.
so just score the personality test so we can get back to crime fighting.
Yeah, that's good, Agent Booth.
now let the anger lead you to the fear.
you can't be whole, you can't do your job to its fullest, unless you get in touch with that fear you feel.
now Dr. Brennan and I are going to close our eyes.
follow the anger, all right?
feel it?
feel it softening.
you feel that?
very mature, guys.
uh...
got to run, Sweets. Got the call.
let's boogie, Bones.
and, um, look, next time, you really should tell me if there's going to be an essay on the test.
I just got off the phone with Hodgins.
he's knee-deep in compost.
he must be happy.
happy as a pig in...
what pigs like to be in.
a sty?
you said you had things to show me?
from the injuries, it appears there was a struggle.
you can see the bruising and fresh hairline fractures on the femurs and left ulna.
consistent with defensive wounds?
that would be my assessment.
so, there was a fight before he was shot?
he wasn't shot.
I thought you said it was a bullet hole.
I was mistaken.
it occasionally happens.
the hole is actually?
a sternal foramen.
so we're back to no known cause of death? Not quite.
I found multiple puncture wounds with hinge fracturing on the scapula and posterior aspects of several ribs.
he was stabbed?
by what?
I'm working on it.
okay then. Enjoy.
Oh, God, I'm never going to get over that smell.
this place is awesome.
the thermophilic bacteria content is off of the charts.
no security cameras.
too high-tech for the granola crowd.
that means we have about 100 suspects.
are you coming in?
no-- you know what? That's your thing.
and I'll just, uh, mess things up if I come up there.
whoa. Oh!
I just heard a crunch.
definitely not plant life.
I'd love to try this feeding fungi.
that's adipocere.
is that good or bad?
good for us.
bad for the victim.
female, probably in her early 20s.
PID decomposition to the microbial activity of the compost pile...
she's been dead about the same time as Curtis.
even dead, Frank was lying with another woman.
these three phalanges still have some tissue.
and fingernails.
I may be able to get some scrapings, maybe even a print.
Calliphoridae didn't have a chance to oviposit.
she must have been buried in the compost just hours after she died.
can you pinpoint how long it would take for her to reach this level of decomp?
well, given the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the compost I sampled, she's been in there since last Wednesday.
meaning she died the day before Frank?
who catches two people cheating, but kills them a day apart?
my sketch isn't matching any of the missing women on file.
well, maybe no one's missed her yet. Poor thing.
everybody should be missed.
Oh, you are such an angel.
I will get a bucket of cold water, I swear. There's perimortem trauma to the skull.
but it's not severe enough to cause death.
I also found multiple broken ribs, and the sternum is severely fractured.
somebody tried to crush her?
no, these injuries are consistent with inexpert use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
somebody tried to save her.
the woman you found
who was she?
well, we were hoping you might know.
I told you, I was out of town.
I have no idea. But you were aware that your husband wasn't always faithful.
yes?
Yeah, you stayed with him.
I get it.
big house, comfortable lifestyle.
I stayed with Frank because I loved him.
I accepted his faults.
I'm sure you'll accept the life insurance money, too.
I'm not even thinking about money, Agent Booth.
how can you even...?
my husband hasn't even been dead for a week.
I'm aware of that.
since you were so forgiving of your husband's infidelity, why didn't you mention that in our first conversation?
Kat.
I couldn't do that to our daughter.
she idolized Frank.
I can't ruin that, especially now.
mom.
Mrs. Curtis, I...
I came over to tell you and Kat how sorry I am.
Gavin said he'd try to stop over later.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
no, Charlie, it's okay, stay.
mom, I knew since high school.
Charlie knew, all my classmates knew.
Oh, God.
come on, Kat.
not now.
I pretended that I didn't.
for you.
okay, so Margie said Frank kept an office in town.
turns out that office was an apartment.
where he took his women.
Yeah, okay, Bones, that's right.
come on, let's go to the apartment.
you know I used that device once in one of my novels, and my editor thought it was trite.
ha! Maybe it was Frank's take on being environmentally friendly, making a friendly environment.
get it?
apparently not.
okay.
you know, I really hate these gloves.
no. No sign of forced entry.
these sunglass frames are made of bamboo.
Oh, is that weird?
well, most frames are made of metal or plastic, sometimes vinyl.
maybe they belong to the Eco Avenger.
who?
Frank. Toiletries in the bathroom, bra hanging over the shower rod.
definitely a woman living here.
dried blood on the coffee table.
let's call forensics and have the place swept.
send everything to the...
to the Jeffersonian, yup.
got it. Including the whole...
Yeah, the entire coffee table.
here...
here we go.
take-out receipt from, uh, two weeks ago.
hop Lee's Chinese Kitchen.
name on the credit card
booth? Yeah.
I think we found our second victim.
she has an interior superior margin fracture to the C-5 vertebrae.
what about the posterior half of the vertebral body?
any linked sagittal fractures?
Yes.
so...
if she fell and hit her head on the coffee table at this angle, that could account for the broken vertebrae.
it's a statistically rare possibility, but one that would have killed her instantly.
FBI sent over some info on our latest victim.
she was a cashier at one of Franklin Curtis's
natural Sun Markets in New Jersey.
how'd she end up in Virginia?
they think she was hiding.
earlier this year, she accused one of her coworkers of stalking her.
check him out.
wouldn't want him following me. I know, right?
guy's name is Noel Liftan.
he was fired.
Emma filed a restraining order.
booth is trying to track him down.
any progress on time of death?
right. Not so accidental.
Hey, Booth.
what about the murder weapon used on Frank? Find anything yet?
these puncture wounds...
I still can't find any weapon this small and curved.
they're close together.
he didn't seem to move much.
which is odd, because the wounds appear deep.
okay, call me after.
booth found Emma's stalker.
he's been staying at a motel right across the street re Efrwa whemma s killed.
don't look at me like that.
you can't arrest me for renting a motel room.
I didn't break any laws.
I mean, I followed her, okay?
but the motel room is over 150 feet from Emma's apartment building.
I measured. Then I guess
I got no reason to suspect you.
I mean, you were just keeping an eye on her.
I was.
Yeah.
who? Frank Curtis.
Frank Curtis You should talk to him. Okay.
he treated Emma like he owned her.
it was so messed up.
Wow.
the reflections on this table, the patterns are beautiful.
focus.
Frank Curtis.
Oh, sure.
Frank comes in for one of his regional visits.
you know, and has the manager hire Emma.
the next time he comes in, he can see that Emma's falling for me.
so he has me fired and then tells Emma to take out a restraining order.
Oh, the fact that you called her 20 times a day and slept in her driveway, that had nothing to do with it?
I guess you've never been in love.
where were you last Wednesday and Thursday?
mostly I just stay in my motel room, you know, keep an eye on Emma's building.
only times I ever leave is to go out and sell my products.
your products?
hemp oil-based body products.
I make them myself.
there's a surprise.
I guess you're telling me you don't have an alibi.
I reviewed the forensic samples from the apartment.
traces of triglycerides, diglycerides, and free fatty acids on both the carpeting and the furniture.
it looks like some vegetable oil.
could it be hemp oil?
booth said the person stalking Emma Billings sells hemp-based body products.
Yeah, that's one possibility.
re-examine any clothing from Frank and Emma's bodies.
see if you can find additional traces of the oil.
okey.
fracturing to Emma's sternum I concealed a malformation that became apparent once I finished reconstruction.
a sternal feramin.
Emma Billings and Frank Curtis both shared a congenital abnormality.
when Zach told me his findings,
I decided to run DNA tests on the tissue samples from both victims.
at Multiple mching RFLPs.
our victims were related.
I've tested over 40 different knives, ice picks, leather awls.
I couldn't find a murder weapon to match.
well, with decomp and postmortem trauma from being rolled down the hill, it's very difficult, Zach.
okay, this will help you visualize the pattern of the wounds.
usually I can determine the weapon.
this is a very frustrating murderer.
I'm sure he'll apologize when we catch him.
there are five puncture wounds to Frank's chest.
the result of repeated stabs by an unknown and very frustrating object.
perhaps s not.
what if Frank Curtis had broader shoulders?
Angela, move tcapuli apart slowly.
a little more.
the wounds become equidistant.
you're probably looking for an instrument with multiple sharp pointed objects projecting from it.
a pitchfork.
how'd you get pitchfork?
these three wounds mark the termination of a three-tine pitchfork's penetration.
makes sense.
I'll go match the exact type and make.
I've got results from the clothes.
you were right.
same vegetable oil on both Frank and Emma's clothing.
but I found a high concentration of methanol and sodium hydroxide mixed in.
so, the oil isn't from body products.
no, it's from bio-diesel fuel.
so your suspect is going to give me a description of your suspect?
I'm not following. Yeah, the stoned hippie guy.
he's all we have so far.
I mean, he'll tell you what the guy looks like who went into Emma's place and then you draw.
you know, I've never really found stoned guys that dependable.
except for cookies.
they always have good cookies.
you're grasping at straws, Booth.
we should wait for more information.
it has to be somebody in the composting facility.
uh, they have pitchforks to turn the heaps, don't they?
pitchforks are used on every farm in the area.
but not bio-diesel, okay?
the owner, Gavin, said he just replaced a fuel pump on his truck when he switched to bio-diesel.
one of the other farmers also said that he just switched.
and he has a key, he could've dumped the b the middle of the n
I'm sorry, but whose side are you on?
uh, don't say the facts, because that just annoys me.
you want us to base our actions on your gut again?
Yes.
you have your shiny machines, I have my gut.
is it always like this when you two are together?
Yes. No.
it's kind of hot.
what the hell is he doing?
it's a Vedic chant.
all right, Noel, let's go, on your feet.
a bass player taught it to me.
I'm trying to calm myself, man.
Emma's dead and I'm innocent.
how many times do I have to tell you that?
all right, you know, Noel
just want to ask you some more questions, that's all.
who are the chicks?
Hey, be respectful, be a gentleman.
let's go, up, up, up... Ow!
come on. There you go.
that's it, okay.
this here is Dr. Brennan.
angela Montenegro, she's an artist.
cool. Yeah, groovy.
did you see a truck parked outside Emma's apartment building last Wednesday?
how would I know?
I mean, it's not like I kept a log of everyone going in and out of the building.
listen, Noel, you're the primary suspect in Emma's murder.
so if you do not cooperate, you're looking at 20 solid years keeping tabs on your cell mate.
all right, fine.
I remember a truck, it had a cool logo from some organic composting place.
we need to know who was driving the truck and if he went in to Emma's building.
what, you think I have bionic vision or something?
no, but you got binoculars
they're in every starter stalker kit
so give Angela something to draw.
I like artists.
I'll crush you like a bug, dude.
describe the guy.
uh, he's a young dude, maybe 26, about my height, average, kind of buff, Caucasian, brown hair, he was wearing sunglasses.
kind of looked like they were made out of wood or something.
far out, huh?
wood.
Hey, do you guys have medical marijuana in DC?
because I get anxiety attacks.
give Angela something to draw.
um... he had a, uh, square jaw, um, straight nose, cute ears.
Charlie Rogan got 'em from Frank Curtis.
Why? What's going on?
why did Frank give Charlie a pair of sunglasses?
no real reason-- Frank wore 'em one day to pick up compost,
Charlie admired 'em, so Frank gave 'em to him.
he was like that. Can you think of any reason why Charlie would want Frank dead?
of course not-- he's a good kid; he loved Frank.
this is the murder weapon.
there you go. Bag it.
it seems like Charlie and Frank had a thing for the same girl.
Charlie gets jealous, he gets into a fight with the girl, kills her, and then he goes after Frank's story.
as old as time, my compost friend.
need something, Gavin? Yeah. Charles Rogan, you're under arrest for the murder of Frank Curtis and Emma Billings. Oh, God, no.
th-this isn't what you think!
Gavin, I didn't...
I swear I didn't... Don't.
don't say a word, Charlie.
cam, we've got the murder weapon used on Frank Curtis, plus evidence linking Charlie to the scene of Emma's murder.
Yeah, well, I hate to throw ants in your picnic, but I recovered DNA from beneath Emma's fingernails...
Charlie Rogan didn't attack Emma Billings.
her assailant was female. What is it?
Charlie didn't kill Emma. What? He was there.
but there's more.
I noticed some odd similarities, so I compared Emma's own DNA to that of her attacker.
there was a 25% commonality.
half sisters.
it was Cat Curtis-- she killed Emma.
my father promised he'd stop fooling around.
my mother was so humiliated.
so you went to Emma.
I had the key.
I was waiting for her.
I scared her, I guess.
and you fought.
she fell.
I never meant to hurt her.
I just, I wanted my dad to end things.
it just looked like she bumped her head.
but she was dead.
cat called.
we were still friends.
I knew she'd never hurt anyone.
it was an accident.
so you told Cat you'd get rid of Emma's body while her and her mother went out of town.
but you leave your sunglasses.
it's not like I'd done this before.
and Frank sees them the next time he goes to visit Emma.
he came at me, man, one night at work.
Frank went nuts.
wanted to know why I was at his place, where Emma was.
he had a pitchfork.
I was turning the compost when he was yelling at me.
he knew what would happen to you and Kat if you found out.
he came at me.
I didn't even know I'd done it.
it was like someone else jabbed him with it.
but the body, Charlie, why'd you move Frank's body?
for my mom, for the insurance.
of course, no payout without a body.
so I tossed him where we knew he'd be found.
dad left everything to nonprofits.
that insurance money was all my mom would have.
you did it for your mother?
I never meant for any of this to happen.
I never meant to hurt anyone, I just...
I wanted my mom to be happy.
your father wasn't having an affair with Emma.
he'd had a relationship with her mother a long time ago.
Emma Billings was his daughter.
she was your half sister.
what? Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, no.
Oh, my God, no!
so, case finished?
Yes. Congratulations.
Yeah.
you don't seem too happy.
well, because sometimes, if you win, you end up with somebody else's pain and screwed-up life.
you work for the FBI, you should know that.
must be a challenge for you to access those feelings.
okay, stop.
you don't know Booth.
you don't know me, you have a limited view of us based on superficial data you've accumulated on a standardized questionnaire, and a subjective analysis from talking to us that is not at all scientific, so back off.
just trying to help.
what? By questioning his humanity?
okay, Bones, now you're going a little bit overboard.
he's just a kid. Right?
I mean, the worst thing that's probably ever happened to him was he lost at Mortal Kombat.
are you normally this protective of him, Dr. Brennan?
we are partners.
our lives depend on being protective of each other.
and you feel the same way, Agent Booth?
sweets, I can only hope that one day you know what a real partnership is.
you two are very close, that was evident in your superficial, standardized questionnaire and my unscientific observations.
yeah?
you complement each other.
no, she never compliments me.
did you compliment me in the questionnaire?
"Complement," not "compliment."
ple.
he means that we complete each other, as a team.
Yeah, right.
now, we've got a lot to work on over the next few months.
meaning we get to stay together?
Yes.
I'm sensing a "but."
however, It's the same as "but.
I have observed some underlying issues that need to be addressed.
issues? Yes.
there's clearly a very deep emotional attachment between you two.
we're just partners.
and why do you think I would have thought otherwise?
cause you're 12.
don't read into anything that Booth said.
we're professionals.
there's a line that doesn't even need to be there.
not at all, I mean, if there were no more murders,
I would probably not even, you know, see her.
that's very true.
might have coffee.
probably not. What?
what?
you wouldn't even have coffee with me?
well, in your scenario, we wouldn't even know each other because there are no murders.
were. I said "no more murders."
then fine.
I mean, we could have a coffee.
so that's clear, then?
I mean, we'd have coffee and that's our relationship?
coffee
Dr. Brennan, Dr. Hodgins, Mr. Vega, thank you for coming.
you get a "notice to appear" from a federal judge, you appear.
I assume this has something to do with the Grave Digger.
the only thing the three of us have in common is that kidnapper.
my name is Heather Taffet.
I'm the United States Attorney assigned to the Grave Digger case last month.
what happened to Ms. Kurland?
she was killed in a car accident in Boston.
so, what, you think the Grave Digger had Kurland killed because she was getting close?
she wasn't getting close.
she was barely conducting an investigation.
nothing has moved in the Grave Digger case in months.
it turns out something did move.
some evidence has gone missing.
you suspect that one of us stole Grave Digger evidence?
from the FBI?
Mr. Vega is a former FBI agent as well as a best-selling author on the Grave Digger.
you both contract out to the FBI...
let me make this very clear
if any of you has any evidence linked to the Grave Digger case,
I am ordering you as a federal judge to turn it over to Ms. Taffet.
turn it over to me today, and you get full immunity.
look at that.
Oh, it's got to be Bones, I guarantee ya.
Yep. I'm hurrying, Bones.
do you need directions?
no, I do not need directions, because I am driving.
my GPS can provide perfect directions in several languages.
well, get this. Okay, Parker got me this new watch and it does the same thing.
in several languages? - No.
well, then it's not the same thing.
I bet you are looking beautiful, huh?
because I am in the finest tux that money can rent.
well, I'm on my way home to get dressed, but you need to be there an hour and a half before me to watch the tribute video.
my GPS indicates that it is a 25 minute drive for you.
this is my big night, Booth.
all right, Bones, listen, don't worry.
I will be there when they crown you super scientist.
I will be the guy in the cocky belt buckle and the snazzy rented tux.
someone's knocking on my door.
how can there be a knock at your door if you're already driving?
you're late.
I know. It took my longer to get dressed than I thought.
but don't worry, my GPS will get us there on time.
it's not a time machine, sweetie.
I call shotgun.
no. - No?
I have taken Seeley Booth. He has been buried alive.
he has 21 hours to live.
bring the evidence to the SW5 DC boundary stone in return for which you will receive GPS coordinates.
if you involve law enforcement, I will know and Seeley Booth will die.
this is my final communication.
what's going on?
the Grave Digger has Booth.
booth? - He's not here. I told you.
I was hoping it was like a prank call or something.
the door was locked. - What does that mean?
well, I doubt that the Grave Digger would take the time to...
give me the shoe.
would take the time to lock the front door on his way out.
Yeah, especially lugging 190 pounds of unconscious Booth.
he was dragged to the window.
Oh, my God.
okay, all right, um, we need to call the authorities.
we're in way over our heads here.
no. No, no, no. I read up on this guy.
if we want Booth back, we need to pay the ransom.
the Grave Digger wanted evidence.
what evidence?
it has to be the same evidence that the state attorney and the FBI think that I have, which I don't.
what... What are you doing?
they called in Hodgins, too.
you think he stole the evidence?
I know you didn't.
okay, okay...
could you stop that, please?
I was just working off adrenaline.
how long ago did the Grave Digger get Booth? What kind of time do we have?
I know you have what the Grave Digger wants.
the evidence that the judge told us about-- the Grave Digger thinks that I have it.
but he's wrong. It's you.
give it to me.
who's there? Who's that?
it's me.
who's me?
best buddy you ever had.
your words.
this isn't real.
I'm gonna go with real.
nice monkey suit, by the way.
I never would have thought to go formal to a kidnapping.
look, no... no offense, but, you know, I've been...
I've been drugged, electrocuted, stuffed in a Beatles toy.
you're... You're an hallucination, that's what you are.
you're... You're an hallucination.
that's nice. I show up to help you, and you toss me off as a hallucination.
you're dead, Corporal. I felt your heart stop.
no use crying over spilt milk, Sarge.
you know what? You're not real. This isn't real.
I am going to focus on what is real, right?
real-- like getting out of this place. Okay. Yeah.
Nah, Sarge, it's too high. How about that one?
I already saw that.
now you're getting competitive with a hallucination.
what? Oh, right. Nah, still here.
you really haven't changed, Sarge.
once you knew what had to be done, nothing could stop you.
enough already, okay?
Yes, sir, Sergeant. - I got this.
Hey, look at that-- making progress.
there. That's everything.
the judge was after a specific piece, Hodgins.
something that you stole from the FBI.
I remember that.
that was embedded in your leg. - Yeah.
probably came off the bumper of the vehicle the Grave Digger used to run me over.
that would be shortly before he buried me alive.
with me.
pretty close to discovering the manufacturer.
which will help us narrow down the suspect pool.
booth doesn't have that kind of time.
what is that?
evidence that the Grave Digger wants.
sweets, you shouldn't be here.
the Grave Digger said no FBI involvement.
I'm a psychologist, not a agent.
an FBI psychologist.
Dr. Sweets, get gone now.
you stole evidence?
you don't know what it was like being buried in that car.
I do. I was there. - I know.
and if we turn over that evidence, we will never catch the Grave Digger.
booth only has 19 hours.
okay, okay, then let's just take ten of those hours and see if we can do both.
Brennan, I'm telling you the answer is there.
ten hours.
eight. And Dr. Hodgins is never left alone.
you don't trust him?
no, I don't.
I scanned the new recording.
bring the evidence to the SW5 DC boundary stone in return for which you will receive GPS coordinates.
if you involved law enforcement, I will know and Seeley Booth will die.
this is my final communication.
along with the recording that the Grave Digger gave when you and Hodgins were kidnapped.
you okay to hear that?
okay.
Temperance Brennan and Jack Hodgins have been buried alive.
wire transfer $8 million to the following Grand Cayman accounts or they will suffocate to death.
and Seeley Booth will die.
or they will suffocate to death.
now, despite the voice scrambler,
I was able to extract specific phonemes by running the waveform through a Fourier Transform.
Graphically, they're identical.
can we hear the unscrambled voice?
no, the coding was too complicated.
but the voice scrambler was triggered to compress at a certain set level.
now, in this case, it was set to the volume of a human voice.
so when the Grave Digger isn't speaking...
right, the background noise pops into the foreground, uncompressed.
what is that?
um, I'm still working on that. Sorry, I...
we'll get Booth back.
you can't know that.
Brennan, I just think that... - Just work, please.
okay.
let me try another algorithm.
birds?
gulls. Seagulls. The Grave Digger was near the water.
fresh one? What?
Oh, hallucinations can't help out a little?
give me that. - You're welcome.
no, Sarge, pry with your legs. Watch you don't hurt your back.
that can't be good.
hang on, Teddy, you're gonna make it.
might want to close that up, Sarge.
Hey, guys.
uh, there was no voice match, but there was a point of origin on the call.
seagulls?
I talked to Booth an hour and 47 minutes before I got the ransom call.
that merry-go-round...
the boardwalk. King's Beach boardwalk.
I got it.
Vega lives in a penthouse apartment just off the boardwalk.
you think this is my fault.
if you hadn't stolen the evidence, the Grave Digger would never have taken Booth.
rationally speaking, it was inevitable.
it would have happened anytime we got close.
is that Vega's car?
who is that? - It's Vega.
he's dead.
looks like he was killed somewhere else and then placed here.
we should take his body back to the lab.
obviously, the Grave Digger killed him.
there's got to be some evidence that we can use.
remove a body from a crime scene?
that would be a very bad idea.
step away from the car, please.
agent Perotta.
look, if the water rises up far enough, I'll be able to get to that door and open it.
what, the room isn't filling up quickly enough for you already?
you were here for an interview?
Mr. Vega was writing Surviving the Grave Digger. He wanted to talk to us.
at 5: 00 in the morning?
it was a breakfast meeting.
were you following us, Agent Perotta?
Yes, Dr. Brennan, I was.
you two are both suspected of stealing evidence.
this doesn't exactly clear you of suspicion.
well, was he under surveillance?
because a fat lot of good the FBI did him.
well, it appears that he was the one who had the evidence.
are we free to go now?
why not? They have us under surveillance.
I'll be in touch.
tell you what, you were always the guy to be with in a tough spot.
you never said anything like that, Sarge.
mostly, you just grunted, made me get coffee.
so what makes you think what's behind that, uh, hatch is gonna be any better than the last thing we opened?
I'll tell you what, I'm either gonna drown fast or really, really slow.
okay.
coming up pretty fast here, Sarge.
Vega's dead.
Oh, God, Vega's dead. Right, like murdered dead?
we had no opportunity to examine the remains before the FBI interrupted us.
what? FBI?
Yep, FBI Special Agent Perotta.
we're going to swing by, pick up the evidence and deliver it to the Grave Digger.
what? You mean just do what he wants?
we have no other choice. You spoke to the FBI.
we didn't talk to the FBI, they talked to us.
somehow, I don't think the Grave Digger's gonna take that into consideration.
we still have time to catch the Grave Digger and to save Booth.
the odds are not acceptable. - Why?
because we don't have Booth to help!
let's be clear here.
what we intend to do next constitutes felony conspiracy.
not you. Me. I can do it alone.
no, no. Nobody does anything alone.
Vega was alone.
what's the hell is that supposed to be for?
it's a fulcrum, Sarge.
we, uh, both work it together.
there, right there. Ready?
there we go. All right, get in. - Real people go first, Sarge.
get in before I change my mind, will you?
okay, get-get a grip, Sarge. You're attacking your own hallucination.
only you are not an hallucination. You helped me open up that hatch.
I wouldn't have been able to open up that hatch without you.
okay, okay. So w-what does that make me?
you are a ghost.
I'm a ghost?
Hey, why aren't you scared?
you being a ghost is not even on the list of things that scare me.
I kept telling you, I said, "Learn to pick a lock."
you remember your response, Sarge?
Yeah. "Any lock worth picking is worth kicking." And I still stand by it.
well, hey, please, stand by it.
advice like that, it's a miracle I lived as long as I did. You got a cuff link?
Yeah.
twenty. - What's that?
you were 20 years old when you died.
still am.
you, Sarge, I got to say, you've, uh, put a couple years on.
Hey, is it true that the 30s is when your body really starts going south on you?
Hey, you got any kids, Sarge?
Yeah, I got a boy.
what's his name?
Ah, you're probably gonna take this wrong.
Why? What'd you do? You name him something stupid, like-like Cutter?
what, Tanner? Brady?
Oh, God, you didn't name him Sebastian?
I named him Parker.
that's my name.
it's your last name. You know, and your lock picking sucks.
you named your kid after me? - Yeah.
what's he like?
he's, uh, he's just like a kid, you know? But, uh, he's even better.
does he like you?
of course he likes me. He loves me. I'm his dad, you know?
he even got me this watch.
what about his mom?
Yeah, she, uh, she likes me.
but, uh, she didn't love me.
you loved her though? - Of course I loved her. I still do.
I just... I just don't like her too much.
you saw I picked the lock, right?
we're on a ship.
uh, Sarge? - Yeah.
this particular ship ain't gonna be floating much longer.
C-4 explosives. Finally a car that revolves around you.
there's a boundary stone through the clearing.
this is weird-- something nearby is broadcasting a video signal.
there. A camera. Up in that tree.
that's how the Grave Digger will see that we brought what he wants.
I might be able to hack into the camera's broadcast frequency.
I got to say, doesn't seem to be the smartest move to just hand over this evidence.
we need to be rational.
we should maximize the chances to catch the Grave Digger, not minimize them.
listen to me, Brennan. Somebody you love is buried alive.
you're allowed to save them, no matter how irrational.
I don't love Booth.
Yes, you do. So do I. So do all of us.
just take my advice, and hand over the evidence and get Booth.
let's do it. Come on, let's do it.
watch your monitor.
tell me if anything changes, okay?
by anything, you mean... - Anything.
okay, I'm in.
I've locked into the video feed.
I hate this guy.
I mean, I really, really hate him.
I will find you!
did you do that?
no. No, uh, that's the Grave Digger. It's the vial he's after.
God, and his receiver's within a 500-yard radius. He's really close.
Oh, uh, Angela, this pointy bit here just got way pointier.
at what frequency? - 2. 2 something.
Oh, my God! - What?
that signal's not coming from the camera. Get back!
run! Run!
go, go! Go!
what the hell is going on here?
you okay? - Yeah. Come on.
we followed Dr. Brennan's car to the boundary stone.
we arrived moments after the explosion.
what the hell were you people doing?
we have nothing to say.
we found evidence at the crime scene believed to be related to the Grave Digger investigation.
I believe they returned evidence to the Grave Digger.
agent Perotta, you will deny all of these people access to this case.
may I make a request, Your Honor?
I'd like to see Thomas Vega's remains.
I need to examine them immediately.
you will examine nothing.
you people will stay away from anything to do with the Grave Digger.
we're in a ship stuffed with toys and explosives.
and that make some kind of sense to you?
Yeah.
what they do, Sarge, is they sink ships for reefs.
they get school kids to do all the decorating.
Why?
the fish. Why else?
fish love decorations.
here's the transponder.
we have six hours and 23 minutes here.
what, no ideas?
according to you, I'm already a ghost. As a result, I got no sense of urgency.
hang on. Maybe we can use the transponder to send a signal.
but that's the only fail-safe.
once you disconnect the transponder, nothing can stop the ship from blowing to hell in six hours and 22 minutes.
sense of urgency now?
it's been almost two hours. Why hasn't the Grave Digger sent us Booth's coordinates?
I think we have to accept that the Grave Digger isn't gonna release Booth.
he's cleaning up.
cleaning up?
Yeah, he destroyed the evidence, now he's trying to destroy everyone who had gotten close to him:
Vega, Agent Booth, you and Hodgins.
it's over. Booth's dead. It's my fault. We're out of options.
no. No, it's not over.
and I know exactly who to ask for help.
so what's so important you couldn't tell me on the phone?
your brother has been kidnapped by the Grave Digger.
Seeley's been kidnapped? When?
booth will be dead in six hours.
what I need for you to do is hijack the remains of a murder victim and then bring them to me.
I'm in military intelligence. We don't hijack dead bodies.
the victim's name is Thomas Vega.
so you want me to steal the remains of a murder victim from the FBI?
Yes. As soon as possible, please.
I can make a few calls...
no, this is not a situation where you make a few phone calls.
that's who I am, Tempe.
I am the guy who makes a few calls.
booth has never turned his back on you.
you are a selfish coward and you never deserved him.
we can feed the transponder's signal through the ship's antennae.
well, you taught me sometimes you gotta stand and fight and sometimes you gotta run like hell for help.
hang on, Teddy. Stay with me.
Sarge? Sarge?
we never should have gone on that last mission.
I mean...
taking out another sniper, that was...
it was way beyond your capabilities. It was... You couldn't have...
that's why you're haunting me, right? You're...
can't an old army buddy just show up to lend a helping hand?
Yeah.
you got a partner now? - Yeah.
you two tight?
Yeah, we're, uh... You would, you'd like her. She's...
her? Way to go, Sarge.
look, just focus here, all right?
corporal, all right, whoever is monitoring the sinking of the ship should be able to pick up the signal, right?
very cool, sir.
you shorted it out. It's useless now. - No.
look, don't worry, Sarge.
Hey, at least we still got this flashlight.
Vega's remains. - Thank you.
so, just to sum things up, the ship's about to explode and now there's no way to stop it.
rub it in-- I got you killed twice.
where we going?
we got to get out of here.
Hey, even if we get up out on the deck, we're gonna have to jump into the ocean.
that's right.
where if the fall doesn't kill us, we'll get hypothermia and drown.
Oh, no, I get hypothermia and drown.
who knows what'll happen to you.
if you die, Sarge, I'm gone.
there's not a single person left on the planet who will remember me. It'd be like I was never here.
no. - No?
no, there's that, uh, that girl. She won't forget you.
you mean Claire?
Yeah, Claire. You know, every day on the anniversary of your death,
I go to your grave and I visit you and there's always flowers from her there.
you ever see her?
from a distance, yeah.
why don't you talk to her?
cause she blames me for your death.
that's crazy.
that's not crazy. I blame me, too.
here we go.
Sarge? - Yeah?
tomorrow's the anniversary. I need a favor.
if I survive this, anything.
I need you to tell Claire I loved her.
you never told her? - I was 20. I didn't know how to say it.
well, you say "I love you." I mean, what's so hard about that?
what, you've never loved somebody and didn't say it to 'em?
see? Maybe that's why I'm here.
get you to say I love you to somebody.
we can get through here.
get through the solid metal wall? - No, the stairs. You see?
the stairs; the thinnest interior bulkhead of a ship is gonna be along the stairs.
we're gonna blast our way through this.
rigor indicates he's been dead less than 24 hours; about the same time Booth disappeared.
Vega must have been killed just after we were threatened by that judge.
two full-thickness burns to the posterior triangle of the neck corresponding with a high-amperage stun gun.
stun gun.
how did you pull this off?
it's masked as a military intelligence operation. National security.
well, how long before
not long if you keep talking so loud.
you're gonna get in trouble, Jared. Definitely lose your job.
I'm aware.
these burn marks are not in the usual place.
on all the other victims, they were equidistant from the inferior nuchal line.
this time they're angled about four centimeters to the right.
this is deep.
the stun gun was held here near his heart for an extended time.
caused fatal fibrillation. That'll be cause of death.
here's a hairline fracture to the olecranon process of the right ulna.
what does that mean?
the victim damaged his right medial and lateral epicondyles as well as his coronoid fossa, possibly consistent with a defensive response to a posterior assault.
our victim got a piece of the bad guy.
he elbowed the assailant.
striking someone that hard, there's going to be damage, at least broken ribs.
got it.
good job, kid. What the hell is that supposed to be.
a well-shaped charge.
it's a mermaid, get it?
it's not sexist 'cause she's mostly fish. - All right.
okay.
all we need now is a power source.
right, that's what the flashlight was for.
I have an injunction here reclaiming jurisdiction in this case.
on what grounds?
one missing FBI agent is not a case of national security.
grab a coffee, guys.
do you have the warrant?
right here, signed by the judge.
I don't think there's any more reason for us to keep the truth from Ms. Taffet.
no, wait, the Grave Digger said that we...
you've been in touch with the Grave Digger?
the Grave Digger has Agent Booth?
she can't seem to extend her arm. - What?
what do you think? - About what?
it's possible.
she had complete access to FBI files and evidence.
nobody wanted the Grave Digger case. It's a career killer.
but with Kurland out of the way...
have you injured yourself recently, Ms. Taffet?
what the hell does that have to do with anything?
don't let Dr. Hodgins go.
could I see the warrant, please?
broken ribs.
she's the Grave Digger?
it's her. - Can you prove it?
no, we can't. Is that a problem?
not for me.
you got a place to lock her up?
Where's Booth?
she's not gonna say anything.
you haven't even asked.
Yeah, I've read extensively on the Grave Digger.
I'm acquainted with the profile.
very intelligent, very calm. She won't speak.
then what do we do?
you have to do spring cleaning on her.
what is that? Is that some kind of torture or something?
nothing. It doesn't exist.
the government keeps secret, black, illegal files on every U. S. citizen.
it's called spring cleaning, 'cause everything's brought out into the light and turned upside down.
o - Okay, that is complete paranoia, right?
I'll need access to a secure terminal. - Follow me.
and only conspiracy nuts call it spring cleaning.
uh, Sarge?
corporal Parker, I really need you to stifle yourself at this juncture, okay?
okay. Yeah, I get it.
I mean, if these two leads touch, that explodes, you become Booth jam.
that's correct.
or if, say, a bead of sweat completes the circuit, then boom!
can I ask you one more question? - What is it, Corporal?
it's just, how are you gonna complete the circuit from a hundred yards away, at which distance you might survive the blast?
one thing at a time, okay?
okay.
first time I've ever heard of a cowardly ghost-- what a wuss.
I'd like to kill you. I hate her. I think I could murder her.
if any group of people could murder someone and get away with it, it'll be us.
I'm not gonna ask you any questions.
I'm just gonna tell you what's going on right now.
I went through your file.
as Heather Taffet, you have lead a very tiny, transparent life.
but in 1998, you married a man named William Burton for exactly one month before you had the marriage annulled.
which was long enough to create an entire identity, a whole, untraceable identity ...
which you used for one thing and one thing only:
to rent a storage locker in Spring Hill.
I gotcha, bitch.
I got to get closer.
you're too close now, Sarge.
you're too close. I'll get it. I'll get it.
you got to get your hands on some truth-telling drugs.
what? - Would you rather torture her?
I know a little bit about that.
no. What? We don't do that.
booth will die.
character is who you are under pressure, not who you are when everything's fine.
we're the good guys; we don't-we don't torture people.
evidence is being compiled against you as we speak, Miss Taffet
tell us where Agent Booth is. You don't want another murder on your head.
okay, see, that's not gonna work.
her pathology necessitates controlling the game.
she's created her own morality-- she's not gonna relinquish control.
Hey, they brought in everything from her storage locker.
okay, back to work, everybody.
Teddy? - Yeah?
I can't see very well.
I looked at the flash. You're okay? Yeah?
uh, I think I could use some help.
is that light?
did we find a way out?
you always find a way out, Sarge.
I'll be your legs. You be my eyes. Come on, Teddy.
which way, Corporal?
towards the light.
Oh, that sounds bad, huh?
move towards the light.
hold up-- these boots were worn recently.
Hey, uh, Jared, can I see your black file of spring cleaning or whatever?
the contents are on my PDA.
talk to me while you analyze.
aedes Sollicitans-- it's a common marsh mosquito.
blood's still in its gut.
indicating it was worn how recently?
at least in the last 24 hours for sure, but... Wait a second.
I got some paint chips here.
run it through the Mass Spec, see if there's anything special about that paint.
Yep. I'm on it.
you still with me, Teddy? - Yeah.
but I got to tell you, I feel like we've kind of...
been here before.
I'm sorry I got you killed.
I was so anxious to get off that shot, take out my target, that I forgot to tell you...
you told me to get down twice.
you gave the order, and I didn't listen. - What?
Sarge... stop.
I didn't come here to haunt you.
I came to tell you it wasn't your fault.
active amine hydrogen, epoxy, hydroxyapatite and silica.
it's an obsolete composition of deck coating used by the navy prior to 1961.
so she was on a navy vessel within the last 24 hours?
Yes. Yeah, an old one-- most likely decommissioned.
wait a minute, a ship? Listen to this.
Taffet was a volunteer at the aquarium.
they were prepping some sort of old navy ship to be sunk.
what? - They're making some sort of reef.
the navy's not afraid of explosions or sinking ships.
Plus, it'll really annoy my brother, the Army Ranger, to be saved by a squid.
Brennan, they know where Booth is.
Jared is getting a helicopter to take you there.
he's on an old navy ship.
you can put me down, Sarge.
you don't have to carry me anymore.
doesn't work that way, Teddy.
temperance, can you hear me? I'm patched through via cell phone.
Jared, I don't understand, why aren't you here in the helicopter with me?
typical navy red tape; nothing to worry about.
but listen, they couldn't cancel the detonation.
something's wrong with the transponder.
what do we do now?
the ship blows in nine minutes-- the navy's only giving you five to get there and get Seeley off.
no, Jared! Booth could be anywhere on that ship!
five minutes is not enough time!
these guys don't negotiate, Tempe. They won't risk any more lives.
are you all right?
it's all worth it as long as you save my brother.
Rangers lead the way, Sarge.
Rangers lead the way, Corporal.
there. All right?
Sarge.
I knew what you did for me.
how far you carried me.
Sarge.
one more thing I got to tell you.
no way you're getting the deposit back on that tux.
booth! Hurry! Come on!
hurry, Booth! Come on!
booth, come on! Hurry!
thanks for coming to get me, Bones.
you should have stayed in the hospital another day.
no, I didn't mean...
getting me out of the hospital, I meant...
coming out on the helicopter to the ship.
thanks for saving my life.
I got you this.
cocky! How'd you find that? That's hard to find.
I read through your report.
seems you would need two people to do most of what you did.
I had help. There was a ghost.
you were... injured, drugged, disoriented, breathing bad air.
there are no such things as ghosts.
Hey, who's the new guy?
that's not a guy.
Hey, baby!
I swear to God, I'd give my left cajoneto take her for a spin.
Hey, the Lord is not pleased with lustful thoughts, man.
Hey, he put her here.
if he wants me to keep it in my pants, tell him to send me a sign.
holy Mary, Mother of God.
it's the Blessed Virgin. Please forgive me.
mama?
all right, let's go everybody. Move back.
Hello? FBI. Watch out. Excuse me.
watch out. - You folks clear a path, please.
thank you. Let's go.
folks, I'm gonna ask you to please stay back. This is an active crime scene.
Oh, my God. It's the Virgin Mary.
have you Googled the grilled cheese Jesus?
cause that was just a faulty griddle.
we're here because someone suspected a crime, Booth.
Oh, I'm just saying, life is a lot more than what you cook up in your chemistry sets.
miracles do happen.
well, religious visions are nothing but pareidolia, random stimulus being perceived as significant.
Oh, yeah? Did you ever hear of the Shroud of Turin, Dr. Burn-In-Hell?
sorry, big guy, that was debunked 20 years ago.
carbon dating doesn't lie.
neither does phenolphthalein.
this was not a miracle.
it's dried blood.
Oh, all right. Let's get this bale of hay down. Come on.
grab the left. - Yeah, let's go! Easy.
all right, here we go. Don't got all day.
there you go. - All right.
let's do it.
careful. - Okay!
okay, I'm going to give you this one.
maybe it's not a miracle.
the fractures I can see are consistent with the baling machine.
based on lack of hemorrhagic tissue, she was dead before ending up in the baler.
can we remove her from the cardboard?
not until she's completely processed.
I don't even know how I'm going to tox her.
the cardboard soaked up most of her bodily fluids.
her blouse looks like it's got patches of glaze on it.
could be extruded body fat.
Ooh, hello, maggots.
maybe Hodgins can use these little devils to give us time of death.
the second joints of the victim's middle toes have been shaved.
I think she was tortured.
no. The victim had her toes surgically shortened.
on purpose? - For vanity. Women love shoes.
like I said on the phone, this is definitely my patient.
I remember I threw in a toe tuck for free.
a toe tuck?
what can I say? Toes are the new nose.
the Board of Plastic Surgeons hasn't approved this for elective surgery.
they haven't condemned it, either.
right, okay. So, who's our girl?
Oh, um, Meriel Mitsakos.
she wanted the surgery 'cause she was getting married.
had her eye on a pair of Christian Louboutin sandals, but her middle toes stuck out.
I said it was an easy fix.
what, you cut her toe off, so she could fit into a pair of shoes?
self-mutilation for an antiquated ritual. It's barbaric.
well, come on, marriage is very important to a lot of people, Bones.
it's ridiculous. No one can guarantee how they're going to feel about someone for life.
we are not a monogamous species.
marriage has been around since the beginning of time.
women from Amazonian tribes expressed their love by spitting in their partners' faces.
I hope we've progressed past that.
okay, well, you know what? Sometimes love trumps logic.
love is a chemical process which causes delusion.
an intellectually rigorous person would never get married.
never say "never."
that's a paradox. It makes no sense.
am I still needed here?
we're not a couple. - No, we just work together, that's all.
Meriel Mitsakos was murdered.
and as of now, you're the only one we know who's taken a knife to her.
Meriel wanted everything to be perfect for our wedding.
including her feet?
I told her I loved her just the way she was, but that...
that doctor made her...
feel like her feet were unsightly.
I... You checked him out, right?
Yeah. He was in Europe at the time of Meriel's murder.
Meriel was my oldest friend.
I was going to be her maid of honor. She asked me in tenth grade.
why would Meriel plan a wedding if she didn't have a groom?
you had to know her. Meriel get everything that she wanted.
and all she ever wanted was to be a bride.
but don't misunderstand. We loved each other very much.
Mike, when was the last time you saw her?
four days ago. About 2: 00-- we had a...
a wedding cake tasting.
I don't want to come off as sounding offensive, but do you think maybe she got cold feet?
we were in love.
all we wanted was each other.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
just find out who did this to Meriel.
where did this come from?
the Egyptology Department.
they let you borrow it?
well, no one was using it.
tell me you're kidding. - No. I left a note.
uh, well, Dr. Saroyan won't let me take the victim off the cardboard, and Dr. Brennan's going to kill me if I don't get her complete X-rays, right?
Wendell, you cannot just take a...
fluoroscopy machine.
I've always wanted to use one, and this is the perfect opportunity.
I just got a call from Ethan Lawrence in Egyptology.
something about a Post-it note where his fluoroscopy machine used to be.
Oh, um, well, their victims have been dead for thousands of years.
there's very little chance of catching the perpetrators.
I figured it was a priority thing, right?
no, really it's more of a firing and arrest thing.
did you really think for one minute...
I found something. Looks important. Very important.
would have gone unnoticed without the, uh... fluoroscopy.
I'm sorry. Did I interrupt you, Dr. Saroyan?
Oh, he's good. - Just show me.
something embedded in the anterior superior iliac spine.
what is it?
a straight pin.
right. Dead bride wearing a strapless bra, plus a straight pin...
she must have had a bridal gown fitting right before she died.
Yeah, well, according to her maid of honor, this is where she ordered her dress.
size six, coming through!
ladies, watch the toes! Man, these women are crazy.
well, you know how I feel about weddings.
Yeah, what's happening here is definitely not about love.
hello.
you're beautiful. Your size is on that rack.
Oh, no, we're not looking for a dress.
no, never. Ever. Ever.
Oh, cold feet. You'll get over it.
you two are obviously meant for each other.
no.
we're, uh, looking for the manager.
I'm Lucia Bertolino. Is there a problem?
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.
this here is my partner, Dr. Temperance Brennan.
how are these treated?
we dip them in glycerin. They're freeze-dried. They last forever.
I'm sure they do. Listen, we're investigating a murder.
we believe the victim was here getting a bridal fitting shortly before she was killed.
uh, a Meriel Mitsakos.
hard to forget Miss Mitsakos.
she had a fight with Anya, our best bridal consultant.
she was screaming at her and calling her incompetent.
right. Is Anya here today, working?
actually, I had to let her go. Anya slapped her.
miss Mitsakos threatened to sue.
I didn't have a choice.
did Anya show any other signs of violence?
was she dealing with something else in her life?
Oh, this place was her life.
well, I'm going to need her contact information.
Oh, Anya couldn't kill anyone.
well, had she ever slapped anyone before?
let me get it for you. - Thank you.
Oh, come on, Bones, huh?
you must've dreamt about being a bride before your heart turned to stone.
just because I don't want to take part in a meaningless ritual doesn't mean that I'm not a warm and affectionate person.
there are even some children who have taken to me.
Oh, my God, I love it! Isn't it perfect? Do you think it's perfect?
it's Daisy. - What?
turn around. Turn around. That's Daisy Wick. Sweets' girlfriend.
don't look. No, she cannot see us.
Why? - Why? Because...
she is buying a wedding dress and some guy is hugging her.
she's marrying someone else without telling Sweets?
don't you think he'd be upset about that? - Yeah, of course.
well, I like Sweets. We should tell him.
no, no, no. No. No. It's got to be our little secret.
here is Anya's information.
Oh, thank you. - Thanks.
you know, this veil would be perfect for you, dear.
uh, well, it's a symbol of virginity and I've been sexually active since I was...
okay, Bones, we really have to get going.
thank you so much for your help. Come on, this way.
a woman buys a wedding dress to get married, Booth.
you know, if you're such a strict adherent to monogamy, then shouldn't you warn Sweets that he's being cuckolded?
now, listen, Bones. There are complicated emotions that are involved here.
it's definitely not your thing.
it's a matter of honesty.
bones, just trust me on this one, all right?
it's none of our business. It's none of our business.
what's none of your business?
we were just discussing our latest case.
the dead bride? Yeah.
that would be completely your business, though, wouldn't it?
no, we were just... - Am I missing something?
Daisy. - What?
no, crazy. Daisy. You must really miss Daisy.
Yeah, we manage. - Let me ask you a question.
could dealing with crazy brides all day make someone, you know, snap and commit murder?
no, the bride snapped first. She had a fight with a bridal consultant.
right, well, if the bride's physical or emotional needs are not met, yeah, she might act out.
violence is rare, though.
Infidelity's more common; using some disposable sap as an emotional Band-Aid.
fascinating. - Let's go.
and spending her free time with a lover...
right, but, uh, physical violence is definitely a possibility, right?
Yeah. - So we got to get going. Come on, Bones.
it is, but you interrupted Dr. Brennan.
we have somewhere we have to be. We're late. See you later. Later.
I worked at Bertolino's for 29 years.
no matter what a bride looked like coming in, when I was done with her, she was beautiful.
but that one-- Miss Mitsakos-- ugly from the inside out.
okay, why don't you just tell us about Meriel.
every time she dropped a pound, she made me adjust that bodice, which would have been fine, but Friday, she decided instead of a drop waist, she wanted a natural waist.
she suggested I start from scratch.
she insinuated I didn't know what I was doing; that her dress issues were my fault.
she pushed me away. Pushed me!
and then you slapped her?
no. I slapped her after she threw the pins at me.
you got fired. You must have been angry.
I pride myself on being a gentlewoman.
I would rather not talk about this any further.
I understand. Just one more thing.
you had Meriel's personal information-- her account, address, et cetera.
can you account for your whereabouts the day after you got fired?
I know what you're implying, Agent Booth.
I was at home. I live alone.
but I have spent the last 29 years bringing joy to young women.
so, no alibi.
I am a gentlewoman.
Hodgins found gravel in her hair, but death by gravel is unlikely.
time to get her off the cardboard?
how? She's basically been absorbed into the substrate.
we could cut underneath, but that runs the risk of compromising the bones.
we have to scrape her off.
look at this.
tox screen results on the pureed maggots: tequila.
the maggots were hammered.
which means Meriel was, too.
Yeah, but it gets better.
the weird glaze on the vic's clothing wasn't extruded fat.
it was glycerin.
according to Dr. Brennan, Bertolino's uses glycerin to preserve bridal bouquets.
looks like Bridezilla might have messed with the wrong old lady.
I used to work at Anthony's Famous in Georgetown.
Oh, that is some seriously good pizza.
the secret is the crust.
it's all in the crust.
does this relate to our victim at all?
this is basically how we get the pizzas out of the oven.
and every pie was perfect.
everybody ready?
this is so far out of my job description, it's not even funny.
okay, we are in.
mm, she's sticking.
it was always tough getting the pie out.
the cheese would bubble over onto the oven and stick.
the pie could break apart.
I wouldn't serve a pie like that.
can we save your war stories for a more appropriate time, Mr. Bray?
Oh, yeah.
careful. Careful of the skull.
okay, perfect.
now that's something I'd serve.
if she were a pizza, which she's not.
so-so, I'll-I'll stop now. - Ready?
carefully. Careful.
can I remove the flesh?
knock yourself out.
so, do you think the bridal consultant killed Meriel?
not really, but, you know, hey, I've been wrong before.
you're usually quite certain.
no, that would be you, Bones, okay?
I'm never getting married.
you've never married. - Well, I will.
that's impossible to know. - You know what?
obviously, you have issues with this, so next time we see Sweets, you should bring it up?
sweets is having an affair with a woman who's engaged.
he's hardly one to give advice.
you know what? You are scared. That's what it is-- you're scared of love.
Dr. Brennan, Agent Booth.
Hey, mind if we join you? - Look at that.
it's Sweets and Daisy.
Dr. Brennan, it's so good to see you.
I want you to know, that even though you fired me twice, I have nothing but warm feelings toward you.
then you wouldn't mind if I spoke freely?
of course not. - All right! We were just leaving.
no, we haven't gotten our food yet. - We don't need the food.
Oh, great! - And she sits.
you know, every time I get stuck on my dissertation, I think to myself,"WWBD."
I have no idea what that means.
what Would Brennan Do?
I mean, it really should be "WWDBD," "What Would Dr. Brennan Do?
but that seems unnecessarily formal since I'm only thinking it silently.
isn't she cute?
Yeah, she's adorable. Come on.
multiple wives is the norm in most of the world.
sweets and Daisy would have no problem if the same were true here.
beg your pardon?
you see, Bones is just so into the murder of this bride, that the facts just start pouring out.
you would really kick ass on that Millionaire show. Come on.
I can only imagine what it would be like to have your brain.
that's true.
Oh, look at that. Text flying in. We gotta go. - I don't see a text.
Hey, how about the four us grab some Mongolian barbecue tonight?
Oh, I'm busy. I already have plans.
with whom? - That's none of our business.
I have yoga class. You don't mind, do you, Lancelot?
it makes me limber. - Oh, here we go.
we really have to get going here. Come on. Come on. Let's go.
uh, so we can take your table? - Have the food, too.
all right! - Wow, they're so nice.
if they want a healthy monogamous relationship, they should be forthright and honest.
Yeah, well, that's not the way a relationship is supposed to be.
most of the boxes don't have any identifiable markings, but the surface scratches on this one look like they may be handwriting.
Daisy Wick is having an affair.
Really?
poor Sweets. He loves her.
booth doesn't want to tell him. He says it's none of our business.
exactly.
but wouldn't it be kind to spare Sweets any emotional pain Miss Wick's infidelity might cause him?
if Sweets is in love with Daisy, and she's cheating on him, somewhere inside he knows.
and if he doesn't, then it's because he doesn't want to.
will you hand me that lemon juice?
I think you are correct.
good. A person's love life...
the scratches on the cardboard should take on a higher concentration of lemon juice than the surface area.
you just want to tell him, don't you?
sweets says that he's an expert in human psychology.
he should be able to handle a problem this common.
come on, sweetie, be kind.
of course.
look, it looks like we can read the writing on the box.
Okay,"Champagne Lounge,"271 Beloit Avenue, Washington, DC.
I'll tell you what. You know what, Bones?
these bubbles are gonna stain my suit.
these bubbles are formed using glycerin.
maybe that's how the glycerin got on Meriel's clothes, not the flowers.
Yeah, right.
Hey, Buddy, over here. - What can I get you?
information. You working here Friday night?
Yeah.
do you recognize this woman?
Oh, wish I didn't.
she sent her drink back three times.
dirty martini-- too dirty.
Mojito-- too sweet.
vodka on the rocks... - All right. Who was she with?
I don't know. Some guy.
rectangular cranial structure, dominant maxillary bone.
look, all I remember is that the dude paid for her drinks.
probably used a credit card, so why don't you go look for those receipts for me?
must have served a thousand drinks Friday.
when I get a chance, I'll look for it. - You should get the chance soon.
better yet, why don't you think about it when I go I card these two blondes over here.
Thanks.
what do you do with those boxes?
recycling Dumpster off the back alley. Why?
all right.
all right, it always stinks in the back alleys, doesn't it?
come on. Okay, let's go. Break it up.
FBI. Come on. Back inside.
all right, no worries. - Thank you.
pea gravel. Hodgins can determine if it's a match for what we found in the victim's hair.
right.
Yeah, Special Agent Booth, 22705.
look, I need a crime scene unit here at 271 Beloit.
back entrance. Thanks.
look at that, huh? I think I may have found the woman's cell phone.
Yeah.
booth? - What do you got?
come here.
Oh, thanks.
we got some blood there, huh?
booth says that if we can pull the call history, he won't have to subpoena the phone company records.
Yeah, I've heard of that place, the Champagne Lounge.
a lot of couples use the alley for a quickie.
okay, well, it looks like it's just the battery.
maybe she was regretting her decision to limit her sexual activity to one man.
you just can't let it go, can you?
all right, this ought to do it.
all fixed.
well done. - Yeah.
Oh, my God, she's getting a call.
What-what...what do you want me to do?
answer it.
Oh, my God.
it's Hodgins.
okay, this is embarrassing.
Yeah, it's worse than that because your picture just popped up on a dead woman's cell phone.
because my phone was within 100 yards of hers.
hey,don't go all squinty on me, okay, Hodgins?
I want an explanation.
it's a dating service.
you're using a dating service?
Yes. Along with millions of other people.
it's called "Date or Hate"?
when a potential match is within 100 yards, both our cell phones ring.
you can either press "date" or "hate."
if we both press "date," then we get each other's cell numbers.
but Meriel was engaged.
why would she be using a dating service?
I don't know. Maybe she forgot to cancel.
guys, sex.
it's a no-brainer.
is that your reason? Because weren't you and Angela sexually compatible?
it's not about the sex.
I was looking for a meaningful connection.
I get it, Jack.
you do?
Yeah.
Hey, guys, dead body, all right? Murder.
did you know the victim before she was a pizza?
no. But she would definitely have many other potential dates.
you should talk to the agency.
the "Date or Hate?" offices are local.
doesn't she work in the cafeteria?
Ouch. She just pressed "hate." You're out. - Okay, all right, just...
we have 8, 000 registered users in the DC area, and almost 200 marital success stories.
well, one of your registered users, a Meriel Mitsakos, was murdered.
did you know the victim?
no, but I'm in the process of securing venture capital to take my company national.
if this gets out, I could lose my investors.
right. Well, we're going to have to take a look at Meriel's "Date or Hate?"activity.
Oh, that's private.
well, she's dead, Mr. Rossi.
or maybe your investors would like the publicity of a court order.
in the last month, she was matched with 20 potentials.
she hit "hate" on 14 of them,"date" on five.
she never responded to the last guy-- a Jack Hodgins from earlier today.
when did she last press "date"?
7: 45 p. m.last Friday.
that was the night she was murdered.
do you have a name?
he pressed "date," too.
I don't believe it.
there's no way Meriel was cheating on me.
you're sure?
we were engaged, Agent Booth.
would you want someone to tell you if your girlfriend was cheating?
or do you favor denial?
no, I mean, I'd know if Daisy were cheating on me, Dr. Brennan.
I'm trained to recognize the subtleties of human behavior.
so, it's a moot point.
you know, I think you found out she was cheating.
I mean, she wasn't really discreet.
using your cell phone to meet other guys.
it's understandable that you snapped.
are you sure about this list?
Yeah.
that's what makes it so understandable.
where were you the night that she disappeared?
dance class.
genie told me how important that first dance was to Meriel and I just wanted to be perfect for her.
in our sessions, you put a high premium on honesty, don't you, Dr. Sweets?
of course. You think he's lying?
uh, no.
I'm talking about you and Daisy.
what? No.
you're wrong, Dr. Brennan. That can't be. You're wrong.
obviously, you can't read all the psychological subtleties that you think you can.
he hugged her and twirled her around in the air.
that's impossible, Dr. Brennan.
I would have known.
this is denial, right?
no, I mean...
Oh, God.
booth felt that I shouldn't tell you, that it was none of our business, but I think that now you can make an informed decision.
either share Miss Wick...or move on.
I'm sorry.
could you excuse me for a moment.
I need a minute to myself.
sure.
booth is finished anyway, so...
I found fractures on the piece of the cranium inconsistent with the compression from the baler.
stop. That's a good one.
Dr. Brennan thought we might be able to find the cause of the fracture by reexamining photos of the tissue.
isolate her head full frame.
I don't see anything, guys.
we're not looking on the surface, we're looking beneath it.
okay, well, I need to enhance the details.
I can shower the image with various wavelengths of light.
next, I apply the filter software.
finally I blacken the blacks, maximize contrast and sharpen the focus.
perimortem bruising.
that's a tire tread.
she was run over by a car.
seems like our victim was flattened before she was flattened.
he was dancing the night away.
I told Sweets about Daisy.
bones, why?
well, I felt like I was lying to him by keeping it to myself.
how about the others?
the others? He was dating other people?
no, the other suspects in Meriel's murder.
what about Owen Smith?
the Bureau's doing a background check.
Smith-- he was using a disposable phone and his e-mail accounts were cancelled.
according to Kurtis, it's a common MO for married men to get a little something-something on the side.
why did you have to tell Sweets?
he's going to come in here, he's going to cry and stuff.
excuse me.
Oh, God.
um, you have a minute?
of course.
I was talking to Agent Booth.
I'd like a minute alone.
sure.
well, I'll get right to it.
Dr. Brennan told me that Daisy is engaged to another man.
I'm sorry, Sweets. I...
it's okay, it's okay.
Dr. Brennan was being honest-- I appreciate it.
no, you don't. Come on.
I don't! I don't! I feel like an idiot!
have a seat. Come on.
she's been canceling on me all the time lately.
like yoga the other day,
if you were your own patient, what kind of advice would you give yourself?
impressive.
turn the question back on me.
it's a classic therapeutic technique.
it's really, really annoying.
did it work?
Yeah, I should confront her.
I should be candid.
you're right. You're right. It's the only way.
thank you.
any time.
it was very helpful.
the session's over.
Hey, you think maybe we could...hug?
like men, of course.
d be comforting for me under the... - No.
no? - No.
I don't hug things out. You know, we just kind of good slug on the arm.
it's more of a manly thing to do.
okay. - Okay.
sure. - Okay?
could you do it again?
sure.
want more?
no.
see ya.
thank you.
Wendell's data suggests that she was struck by an SUV.
the patella fractures are several centimeters higher than a standard car bumper.
you didn't find any incised wounds with glass or paint, did you?
no, why?
I'm just confirming that the victim didn't wrap around the hood.
which means that her center of gravity thrust her backward, something like this.
Hey, whatever happened to your online dating thing?
I didn't have the time to properly sort through all the potential matches.
you thinking of trying it?
I think Sweets should sign up.
did you really tell Sweets that Daisy was cheating on him?
everyone seems to think that I've done something terrible.
I didn't want to lie.
in this case, it was definitely the way to go.
okay, ladies, It's ready.
in newer model SUVs, the grill protrudes almost as far as the bumper.
it's like being hit by a battering ram.
I thought you said you found tire treads on her head?
no, I'm not finished.
assuming this was done on purpose, the driver backed up to see where his victim had landed.
and then, he gunned it.
the multidirectional fractures on the skull are consistent with a tire's downward vertical force.
the killer ran her down, and then made sure she was dead by running her over again.
that is much worse than anything I might have done to Sweets.
I'll call Booth.
excuse me, Dr. Hodgins.
Yeah.
I wanted to tell you that I'm going to the Founding Fathers for a drink tonight with some friends.
girlfriends.
girlfriends.
Yeah. I've got a bunch of friends who are girls and we get together and hang out like we're guys...
it's not as confusing as it sounds.
most of them are single.
trying to fix me up there, Wendell?
I'm offering you an opportunity to meet some great people.
who have breasts.
that they do.
I think they'd like you.
you don't really know me.
I grew up on the streets, Dr. Hodgins.
it doesn't take me long to get a feel for someone.
first round's on me.
booth got the name of the victim's drinking partner from the bartender at the Champagne Lounge.
he works in this building.
there's another SUV.
DC plates, F793A4.
those plates are registered to Joe Fillion.
so this guy ran her down, then backed up and ran over her again?
that's a bad date.
these stains could be blood.
what was the height of the patella fractures?
uh, 54 centimeters.
undo my necklace.
I need to measure if the point of impact matches.
what happened to your measuring tape?
I don't know.
it's missing.
there was a Post-it note from the Egyptology Department in its place.
exactly one and a half lengths high.
consistent with the patellar point of impact.
the victim's skull was crushed by a tire.
it was the proximate cause of death, yes.
the victim had black hair, right?
Yes.
I think we found the murder weapon.
so, were you at the Champagne Lounge to meet women in general or Meriel in particular?
no, I was meeting Meriel.
look, there's no secret-- her friend Genie knew.
I wanted to get my engagement ring back.
you were engaged?
Yeah, she broke it off when she met that Mike guy.
the ring was my grandmother's.
did she give the ring back?
no.
she sold it to pay for her wedding.
she sold your grandmother's ring?
are you kidding me? That's only the half of it.
when we were talking, her cell phone rang.
it was one of those "Date or Hate?"match thingies.
and Meriel presses "date."
wow, that must've made you mad, Joe.
Yeah.
Oh, c...Oh, come on, look, man, you're not going to blame me for this.
all right, no, look, she is not going to screw me again!
whoa, look at that. That is the Lab calling. They tore apart your SUV.
anything you want to tell me before I pick this up?
Yeah.
I want a lawyer.
well, you know, he didn't do it. At least not with that vehicle.
what about the hair and the blood?
uh, he hit a dog last week.
when he talked about it, he burst out into tears.
you know, he was more upset about that than he was about Meriel.
well, she lied to him and he hates her for it.
cam thinks that I should've deceived Sweets, too.
you know, I don't understand.
our lives are devoted to the pursuit of truth.
bones, you can't go around telling everybody what's on your mind even though it's the truth.
okay, look, what if you and I were going out, right, and you were, you know, taking forever to get ready and you came out in this dress, and I told you I didn't like it.
what are you gonna do?
I'd reevaluate, change, or ignore you.
of course you would, Bones, good answer.
here's the guys that Meriel met on that "Date or Hate?
we're looking for Owen Smith.
here he is, Owen Smith.
hmm, he looks weird.
Why? The guy looks perfect.
I know, that's what's weird.
he doesn't look real, right?
seems too young for plastic surgery, but these wide flaring cheekbones
there's no way that they could coexist with this nasal bridge.
he is real.
Owen Smith, her final date.
connected at 7: 45 the night she disappeared.
I don't know...
what's so important, Lancelot?
you miss me too much?
please, sit down, Daisy.
what's wrong?
I've-I've devoted myself to this relationship.
I've given you everything. My heart...
are you breaking up with me?
I love you, but I can no longer...
Youarebreaking up with me.
tears will have no impact on me, Daisy.
Why? What have I done?
you're engaged to someone else, for God's sakes!
I'm not gonna be your little boy toy.
what?
all those classes that you go to...
you probably don't even take yoga, do you?
if I wasn't taking yoga, how could I do a Shirshasana?
what about the wedding dress?
baby, my cousin is out of town.
Bertolino's was having their annual sale.
we're the same size.
it was 50% off, one day only.
okay, and that man you were with?
not mine.
I love my Lancelot.
Oh, my God.
I was so jealous.
how could I have doubted you?
we're both beautiful people, Lance.
I mean, we're bound to get jealous sometimes.
I wish we could run home together right now.
I can't wait that long.
I can't believe I didn't see that before.
see what?
what are we looking for?
okay, Owen is a composite of these four other dates.
look, he has Graham Mouw's chin, Mel Jensen's eyes, Frank Henley's mouth, and Mickey Jasper's nose and cheekbones.
someone created the perfect man in order to meet our victim.
someone who had access to all these photos.
that's insane. Why would I create a fake person just to meet some girl?
because your facial morphology is subpar.
your supraorbital torus is too high and thick, you lack a mental eminence.
he gets the picture.
this is crazy.
right, we checked with the DMV. We know that you drive a sport utility vehicle.
you see, the forensic team is examining your SUV right now.
it was an accident.
hitting her once might have been an accident, but running over her twice seems very deliberate.
she said she wanted a funny, smart, successful guy. That's me.
I just wanted a chance.
really, and you thought she'd overlook the fake photo that you put in there, too, huh?
all these beautiful women on my service, but...
none of them will look at me.
I'm better than half the losers that sign up.
she laughed you off and you followed her?
no.
he alley on my way home.
she was having a smoke.
I rolled down my window to talk, just talk, and she gave me the finger and walked away.
and you ran her down.
twice.
I don't know what happened.
I'm a nice guy.
I'm smart.
I'm just what she asked for.
what? - Booth, it's Bones.
Yeah.
I should've called.
no, come on in.
you kidding me?
I saw Sweets and Daisy, and I was wrong.
she wasn't cheating on him.
well, that's a good thing, right?
well, I wanted to spare him pain, but all I did was cause it.
you meant well.
I made him so jealous, I almost ruined their relationship.
I should've listened to you.
maybe next time you will.
Hey, I was just gonna go out and grab a bite to eat, some Chinese, maybe some...
I'd rather drink.
do you want one?
Yeah, we could do that.
my good bottle of scotch.
uh, bottoms up, Bones.
you know, intellectually I know that jealousy is absurd.
but I see that it's real for people.
I even experience it myself.
so...
who are you jealous of?
you.
Why?
because you all want to lose yourself in another person.
you believe that love is transcendent and eternal.
I want to believe that, too.
Hey, you will.
I promise.
someday you will.
you will someday, okay?
you will.
but people are as wrong about that as they are about everything.
in the darkest moments before dawn, a woman returns to her bed.
what life is she leading
is it the same life the woman was living half an hour ago
a day ago
a year ago
who is this man
do they lead separate lives or is it a single life shared
do you love me
Yeah. Do you want me to prove it to you
if you're not too sleepy.
a storm approaches.
it is still over the horizon, but there is lightning in the air.
are either of them aware of the gathering turbulence
can they feel the crackle of electricity in the wind
or are they aware of only the power that they generate between themselves
I love when you do that.
the first hint of this storm is not a thunderclap.
it is a knock.
get it.
No! You get it!
no, you get it. You get it!
great. I get it.
what ! what !
good morning. I'm Detective Saroyan.
Yeah, I know who you are. You're my brother's partner.
she prefers the term "boss."
official visit. See the badge
what's going on
there's my robe.
uh, a body was found at your nightclub.
so who was still at work when you left
Zack came in just before 4: 00, brought the car around for me.
and then Fisher was supposed to come in at 5: 00
so they could do inventory.
do you think it was one of them
well, you know what? They should have said more than, "There's a body."
they found him laying in the bathroom.
is it terrible?
when Zack saw it, he, he screamed.
I heard him from the kitchen.
Yelped, not screamed.
ready
I was taken aback.
it was a scream.
she has never seen a dead body before.
he was in the Army, and has seen too many.
recognize him?
no.
you didn't see this guy last night?
no.
neither of us was on the floor much last night.
what about this
you ever hear of a place called Amicangelo's Hmm-mm.
which one's closer to the washroom, Your office or the kitchen
my office.
how is it the chef heard your assistant shout, but you didn't hear a gunshot
maybe I'd already gone home.
I left at 4: 00 A. M.
blood coagulation suggests time of death occurred between 1: 00 and 3: 00 A. M.
obviously, you weren't where you said you were. So where were you
from midnight until 4: 00 A. M. I was in my office.
then I went home.
let's go, honey.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
you think that was insensitive
I don't know. Implying that she was cheating on her husband maybe could've waited until he wasn't standing right next to her.
Why? They bust up and you finally get a crack at her.
that's what you want, right
I know you all worked late last night.
may be short on sleep, but I need to prepare you for what happens next.
anybody not heard about our murder
good, because you are all suspects.
somebody turned off the security cameras.
you think one of us is the killer?
you mind, Detective Saroyan
I am conferring with my clients.
are you, in fact, acting as our solicitor in this matter
I'm the nightclub's lawyer.
you are welcome to call up your own.
if we didn't do it, then why do we need a lawyer
I didn't kill anyone.
Zack screamed when he saw the body, so he's off the hook, right? Yelped.
he screamed like Slutty Girl #1 in a teen horror flick.
from here on in, you do not answer questions you don't get asked!
consider me your top suspect.
Oh, for God's sake.
I'm a trained chef, all right
finest schools in Europe, but my professional life consists of cooking chicken wings designed to make people drink more beer.
I'm a man on the edge.
your wings have been voted "Best in the City" two years running.
not best. Tallest.
I'm the originator of the "Tower of Wings."
which'll probably be on my tombstone.
never seen him in my life.
you're the hostess.
you see everyone who comes in.
uh, maybe if you had a picture of him alive
I don't have a very good visual imagination.
he looks like a lot of guys.
is that his real hair?
let the record show that my client is indicating with his head that he does not recognize the victim.
like all my clients.
next question.
have you witnessed any altercations, any differences of opinion at the club lately?
well, Mr. B-- that's what we all call Mr. Booth
told this hip-hop impresario, "C-Synch."
who is actually very cute, by the way
that he would never book him or any of his acts into the club.
C-Synch, yeah. He's, uh, he's all right, isn't he
right hand full of talent, left hand full of street cred due to the fact that his brother is a big-time gangster.
aka C-Synch
you restrained him from lunging at your boss?
I heard C-Synch shouting all the way at the back of the coat check.
he was mad.
are you aware of a city councilman named Max Keenan
everybody knows Max. He's around all the time.
Max Keenan is upset because he never got his "facilitator's fee
for getting City Council to rezone us for live entertainment.
why would a crooked politician tell you that he was upset about not getting a payoff
I'm a bartender.
I'm practically a psychologist.
a Persian named "Ara" something wants to buy the nightclub.
Bren's met with him about 40 times.
Mr. B does not want to sell.
it was me who shut off the security cameras.
I wanted some privacy with my boyfriend, whom I will not name.
okay, me and Daisy, we got a thing, but the thing that we have isn't, you know, isn't a boyfriend/girlfriend thing.
it's a thing.
it's just not a thing.
ms. Julian warned us that you have to make an arrest in this case.
I just want to say that just because
Jared Booth and I went out on a couple of dates and he cannot accept the fact that it is going nowhere, does not mean that I should go to jail.
didn't your lawyer tell you not to answer any questions that you weren't asked?
should I mark your people down as "stupid" or "uncooperative" ?
put 'em down as "well-represented" .
how about I put 'em down as "accessories after the fact"
how long will they keep the club shut down
Oh, as long as they want. It's a murder scene.
financially, that's gonna hurt.
I'm your councilman. Maybe I can help.
how much is that gonna set us back
I want you to consider the possibility that this unfortunate incident...
you mean the homicide
maybe if you had remembered to reimburse the people that went out of their way to get you that zoning change.
okay, really
what, are you gonna put the squeeze on us retroactively
why is it so hard for you husband to see the ways of the world
because he wants me to be proud of him.
I'm afraid you won't be able to reopen the nightclub for quite some time.
where can I appeal that decision
Wow. What they said about you is true.
what's that? That you're kind of a cold fish.
if by "cold fish," you mean pragmatic and rational, then that's what I am.
no, I meant more like somebody when a human being is murdered, cares more about reopening the club than catching the murderer.
I have my job, you have yours.
where were you really last night
who were you with
I had a very satisfying go around with my husband at about 5: 00 this morning. How about you
the victim was killed by a gunshot wound to the chest.
guns are loud, but you did not hear it.
you were not in the building.
either we talk about this now, maybe it goes no farther.
otherwise, I gotta pursue this line of inquiry in a graceless manner.
so this is blackmail
you pride yourself on being pragmatic.
I figured you'd appreciate the logic.
this guy, the Persian, whatever.
how bad does he want your place
who, Vaziri
kind of guy who won't take no for an answer.
Why? - Because the guy comes up shady.
but he's got an alibi for last night.
twin hooker alibis.
I'm gonna tell you something, something Cam doesn't even know yet.
coroners found fibers inside the bullet track from something used to muffle the gun.
that would explain why Bren didn't hear the shot.
Yeah. It's amazing what forensics can do these days.
now, if we we happen to find that particular item, it could lead straight to the killer.
so you think I know where it is
I'm just saying the best thing is that item never turns up.
cam says everybody thinks I'm a cold fish.
what you are is Iceland.
cool to the touch, but underneath, you're all volcano.
I don't like people thinking that I'm a cold fish.
look, if you were really a cold fish, you wouldn't care.
you used logic on me. That's sweet.
cam says the reason
I didn't hear the gunshot is because I'm cheating on you.
Oh, Jared thinks, you know, I'm the killer and is helping me get away with it.
so, you're a murderer, I'm unfaithful
we're a very exciting couple.
except the real reason you didn't hear anything is that the gunshot was muffled.
that's Caroline's phone. What's she calling for
hello.
you've reached Bonnie and Clyde. Murder, Incorporated.
how may we help you
Yeah, it's, uh, it's Max.
Max, what are you doing on Caroline's phone
I don't own a cell phone.
big Brother always knows where you are when you got a cell phone.
I guess when you're as shifty as Max here, paranoid is good.
you're open for business tonight.
well, how'd you pull that off
let's say I went in the front door, Max slipped in the back, and we got it covered.
what does that even mean
just means you got to remember what they say about one hand washing the other.
that particular clich pertains to people with clean hands, Max.
you do not qualify.
there's a blood stain on the bathroom wall.
Yeah, someone smashed the victim's head against the wall, knocked him out, and then came back, finished him off with a shot to the chest.
very cold-blooded execution, in fact.
how did you know that
I eavesdropped on the cops.
also, they're looking for something that was used to smother the sound of the shot.
why do you have a gun
what-- Oh-oh! Okay, I'm English, all right
we don't use guns.
we use our foreheads.
what you've just picked up is most likely the murder weapon.
why would the murderer hide the gun in your stuff
perhaps because the murderer sussed me out as, you know, the type of fellow who'd be smart enough to get rid of it.
evidently, he didn't expect you to be here when I discovered it.
maybe we should get rid of it.
you and I are not in collusion. - Why not?
because you're the type of moron who goes to jail for a murder he didn't commit, and I, uh, am not.
then what do we do? Okay, what I should do is kill you with the gun and then tell the cops that you attacked me after confessing to the murder.
it's hard to believe that someone was murdered just over there.
means nothing to me.
I'm a bestselling pulp crap crime novelist.
I trade in death daily.
theoretically.
what liquor best exemplifies death by substance abuse
irish whisky, of course.
but what spirit best represents murder most foul
you know, everyone that works here is a suspect.
I'm working with a murderer.
now, do you have a picture of this poor bastard that was murdered
fisher sent this to me this morning, before the cops arrived.
I'll only show you if you lose the Irish accent.
take a look.
the man is obviously a hired killer.
you get that from a phone pic
his hair, his suit, his ring, the fact that I talked to him last night...here.
here? In this bar?
I didn't see him.
gotcha.
Yeah, right.
none of us did.
very good.
murder most foul.
Yeah. Do you feel that?
I mean, this place is magic.
your stage has mystic properties.
no, that is a ridiculous urban legend.
then explain to me how so many people that played here over the years have gone on to fame and fortune.
maybe because we have good taste.
this place had the power before you got here, and it'll have it after you're gone.
all I want is my piece of the legacy.
sing, sing, baby.
and if you had good taste, you would book me first
well, dig this. I recognize your personal talent.
...because of your brother.
so you're just brazenly racist
sorry? Speak louder.
this is exactly where I did not want this conversation to go.
my husband is concerned about your gang ties.
which is not you, but is your brother.
look...
there's Cain and then there's Abel.
you see a mark on my forehead
Nah.
so that makes me Abel.
and on top of that, how are you gonna...
how is that fair? As your lawyer,
I must advise you, if Mr. Edison lodges a suit, the outcome is not assured in our favor.
we will discuss it.
since we are partners.
aye, aye.
look, um, I know whatever you're doing is-is very important.
it's-- C-Synch. C-Synch.
Hey. What's up
be glad you're a pasty Brit albino, Vinnie.
Cheers.
um, I need to talk.
Oh, no.
200 million unregistered guns in the country, this one finds its way into my gear.
anybody touch it?
did anybody touch it?
legally, if it's with my stuff, can I just, like, claim it as my own and toss it into a volcano
Caroline is an officer of the court.
she has to report it, right
I sure as hell do now.
.38, right
matches the murder weapon.
Zack touched it.
will you two let me do some of the detecting, please
Saturday night special.
totally disposable.
my theory, it's the murder victim's gun.
taken away from him by persons unknown, who shot him in the chest then hid it here thinking that Vincent would find it, panic and throw it away, because he's, well...English.
who's this, now
very successful crime novelist.
they never get anything right.
I'm not gonna fare well in jail.
I'm lovely.
don't worry about it, Vincent.
I'll bail you out.
you, too, Zack.
no Vincent, no DJ.
no DJ, no entertainment.
time to carpe your diem, bub.
you mean the band
get a girl to smack the tambourine, you maybe got a shot.
you mean Angela
of course I don't mean Angela.
you don't stand a chance with Angela.
her.
pansy or Buttercup.
mysterious Persian real estate mogul who's been trying to buy our home away from home.
what nefarious reasons does he have
I want this club 'cause I know how to turn it into a gold mine.
boring.
good business, like a good marriage, is outwardly boring.
sorry.
last night, I go home a little before 3: 00.
I check to make sure Bren is locked in safe.
I wonder, did somebody tape the door after I checked it 'Cause this guy got in somehow.
you mean the dead guy or, uh, whoever killed him
there's nothing tacky on the bolt here, so it wasn't taped.
that means either the dead guy hid in the club after closing or Bren let him in after my sweep.
no, she didn't. Whoever killed this guy either had a key or was also already in the club.
Bren was the only one inside the club.
you seem pretty sure this is the way it played out.
the dead guy...
chats me up last night.
okay, why didn't you tell the police
creepy old guy, trespassing around our club during the night
I know what I'd do if I caught him.
did you catch him
Nope.
did you? 'Cause until I get the specific answer to that question, my loyalty's with you.
I didn't catch him, but I appreciate your loyalty.
Hey, Arastoo, how you doing?
he's making me another offer on the nightclub.
Really? How big of a bump do we get for murder?
well, the offer is lower.
this place is under a cloud.
things like this occur when people are not reasonable.
implying that you are behind the murder trying to scare me to sell.
ballsy move, pal.
behind it? No.
merely taking advantage.
it's good business.
right, well, my nightclub is not for sale.
but my booze is. So either get a drink or get the hell out of here.
Hey, Booth, Bren.
heard about Vincent being arrested.
can my band audition- No.
come on, what's the harm
be ready in one hour, pal.
Yes! Yes!
you won't be disappointed.
Why？ - I got a soft spot for the kid.
well, you're made of soft spots.
you're still gonna make the call, right
of course I'm gonna make the call.
I'm not soft in the head.
what is the call?
it's why I own this place and you never will.
okay. So...drink or you gonna leave
Hey.
awkward.
very awkward.
awkward. Angela, what is awkward
it's a floor plan for the nightclub.
Yeah.
I drew it.
for the murder victim, last night.
you know how what I always really wanted to do is interior decorating, right
I mean, I'm very good. I sort of have a knack.
and he told me that he owned a nightclub and that he'd hire me to
and I figured he was probably hitting on me, but then Jared showed up and asked me out for, like, the hundredth time.
why are you showing this to me
because if I show it to Mr. B, his head will explode.
you're a cooler customer.
I'm not a cold fish, I'm Iceland.
okay.
if I had a firmer grasp of geography,
I might know what you mean.
why would his head explode
well, note the X at this office.
traditionally, X marks the spot.
the safe? You think he wanted to rob us?
well, yeah, maybe.
or it's possible that the X marks a whole other objective.
the only thing left is...
me.
why didn't you show this to the police?
because they'll take it without telling me if it means what I think it means.
what do you think it means
people know the best way to hurt him...
is to hurt you.
the Persians are capable of sending a very bad message.
what do you mean, bad message
head cracking.
leg breaking. Neck snapping.
finger snipping. Like that.
it's possible they sent this guy.
to break my legs
and the gangbangers make him and they kill him to make a statement.
so, Booth was right about the gangbangers
everyone serves somebody.
something your-your husband refuses to accept.
I know he's stubborn.
he's a man of principle, and I mean that as a terrible insult.
now, if he had just paid me off, none of this would have happened.
who do you work for that could scare off the Persians and the gangbangers
ask your brother-in-law about the Gravedigger.
because he's a cop
because he and I work for the same guy.
hello
the murder victim has been identified as Dick Vorstenbach.
he was a security consultant for a waste disposal company in Newark.
ha. A mobster named Vorstenbach? What's the world coming to
so, what was he doing at our place?
that's a mighty fine question.
where did you get this? What's that?
it was slipped to me anonymously by someone who drew it for Vorstenbach last night.
your office is marked.
meaning Vorstenbach was in your club last night, but nobody saw him.
excuse me, Cam, but this napkin proves that Vorstenbach was sent to hurt my wife.
that is one of our theories, yes.
could the Gravedigger have sent Vorstenbach
now, where'd you dig that up
isn't he some old mobster type Has his finger in every pie
there's no Gravedigger.
Max Keenan likes to say he works for the Gravedigger.
it makes him scary. Exactly, so forget the Gravedigger.
look, our first job is to find out who killed Vorstenbach, finding out who sent him is totally secondary.
right, but here in the real world, when do we get our DJ back
never. Your people are lying to me and till I find out why, you can't have your DJ, nor your assistant, nor anybody else I can scoop up.
now, now, it's blatant police brutality to use the word "nor" so aggressively. Hmm
violent death, murder, it sends out shockwaves.
the closer you are to it, the greater the shock.
Max told me that he works for the Gravedigger.
but he told me something else.
he said that Jared works for him, too.
don't get so mad. Max could be lying.
look, I'm mad because I don't find it hard to believe at all.
all right. Did Max give you the napkin
Nope. Angela.
what? What? What do you mean, what
why are all our employees holding out on the cops
they love us.
especially you.
they love us. We're lovable. So, okay...
what math gets them to obstruct justice
they all know that you'd kill anyone who was going to hurt me.
and that man, Vorstenbach, was going to hurt me.
they think I'm the killer?
that's the math that gets them to lying to police and obstructing justice.
Hey! So, uh, we're Gormogon.
um, I mean the name of the band is "Gormogon."
some people think that I'm Gormogon, but I'm not.
it's like there's no one named "Floyd" in Pink Floyd.
just play, Sweets. Yeah.
Gormogon? That's a stupid name.
what does it even mean? Every single step I take... Seems to go the other way
from the one that I'd intended. Thought this lunacy had ended. And the seasons never change. They just always stay the same. Like a band with just a drummer. I'm in never-ending summer. And I'm alone now
man, I'm telling you, I'm looking at Sweets in a whole different way.
Really? And I'm alone now. And I'm alone now
thank you. That was wonderful. That was wonderful.
why did they even invent piano? The thing is, it's a...It's a nightclub. Um...
and people, they got to dance, not just...
fall in love.
uh... You're really good.
Oh, stop.
uh, it was great stuff, though.
you know, uh...
people, they got to...It's a dance club.
big beat. Big noise. You understand.
all right.
Hey. My brother would like to talk with you.
he's waiting for you out back.
right. Sweets, why don't you play another song for the girl there
Oh, come on.
what's going on, boss? - Oh, I got a meeting with an angry gangbanger in the alley.
Why? - I got my gun.
you got a gun? - He's the leader of a gang.
he's killed people. And he hates your guts.
I ain't no mathematician, but that adds up bad.
okay, hang back. - All right.
I want my brother to play in the club!
open the door, boss! I'm right here. Come on!
I'm coming!
that makes sense of them Sinking to the starting line Where our love was just a fin...
well, who is that?
C-Synch's brother. Head of the gangbangers.
don't move or I'll blow your head off.
you want to drop that
thank you.
Hi, honey.
Hey. You okay
Yeah, you should see the other guy.
so, who do you want to arrest
let's take them all.
look, man, my brother don't sag, slang, or bang.
what about you
I mean, Clark barely talks to me, you dig
why do you care
he's my brother. And your club is on my block.
do the math, man. Look, I been here before, okay
place becomes a gang hangout, East Coast meets West Coast.
somebody gets popped.
says the dude with the dead body in his bathroom.
Yeah. For all I know, you did it.
I pop somebody, I don't muffle the shot, brother.
I shoot him straight on in his face.
ask anybody. Look, man.
what if I decree your place off-limits to my crew or any other crew
you can decree? - He's my brother, man.
I want to see him get his cheese, see his face on buses.
fine.
C-Synch in the house.
you still think it could be him
Nope. He'd have taken credit if he did it, used it to scare your brother.
that guy's got nothing to do with Vorstenbach's murder.
let him go.
Thanks.
now they have my assistant, our doorman, and our DJ.
all right, well, I can watch the door until they release Wendell.
what about entertainment
I thought Sweets was fantabulous.
we got the crew.
what crew? - Hey.
uh, so, Daisy told me something and I figured you need to know.
that murdered guy?
I sort of had a conversation with him.
and you didn't tell the police
well, it's what they discussed that's important.
it's Daisy, so they discussed sex.
that's mostly true.
please, what is the point
Lance's songs were so romantic, which made me amorous.
Oh, maybe skip ahead a little.
well, Lance was nervous we'd get caught because I'm unabashed about noise.
okay. Is it "skip" or "ahead" or "point
that she doesn't understand
well, I told Lance that I knew a place where a couple in love could find some privacy.
we also told Vorstenbach
Yeah. That's the point.
when Wendell does his sweep, he never checks the lost and found.
Vorstenbach could have hid back here, and waited for the club to be empty.
remember all those wooden matches around the body
he was here.
why didn't you tell the police you saw Vorstenbach
fisher says that Mr. B probably killed the guy to save you and we should do everything we could to impede the investigation.
was that wrong
it felt right.
they let you out? - Yes.
someone stole my shoes.
of course they did.
sweets found your coat.
I don't get the connection.
it was jammed into a case of premium gin.
he brought it to me.
I found the bullet hole.
someone used my coat to muffle the gunshot
well, what did you do with my coat
that's my expensive Belgian corduroy coat
I decided to douse it with pure grain alcohol and burn it.
so, you two conspired to keep this big secret from the rest of us
Mr. B had the strength to bash the guy's head against the wall and you have the...
clarity of will to shoot him.
well, is that why you picked up the gun
in case my fingerprints were on it
I've learned a lot from Mr. Hodgins's books.
Zack and Sweets found my Belgian corduroy coat and burned it because it had a bullet hole in it.
are you serious? - Yeah.
they figured that you bashed his head against the wall, l, l,Yeah. and then I shot him.
should I be upset that everyone thinks that we're murderers or just happy that everyone's trying to help us get away with it
you should recognize that everything they do to help makes us look more guilty.
especially you.
why me
because you are strong enough to smash his head into the wall and I'm not.
Oh, so, we having some doubts
not about anything important.
here.
Yeah, the fibers we found in the victim's wound are Belgian corduroy. How'd you know
we can't find Bren's coat.
if it's in that club, we will eventually find it. So...
Yeah, I know, I heard you the first time
find the coat, get rid of it, burn it, whatever.
the only problem is I didn't kill the guy.
Max says you're in the Gravedigger's pocket.
did he send this man? - Max is nuts.
and crooked as a stick in water.
look, hey, hey.
somebody put this Vorstenbach guy on Bren.
what?
you're not going to like it.
somebody comes into my club to hurt my wife
of course I'm not going to like it.
Bren was cheating on you with the Persian.
you got that wrong.
met with him over a dozen times.
over 70 phone calls in the past three weeks.
how many times a day you talk to her
this is what happened.
they get into a thing. It goes South.
Bren figures out that it's not true love, that the Persian wants her for your nightclub.
and then he threatens her.
he sends this Vorstenbach guy on the job.
but you don't see it because you don't use your head.
you think everything that you feel is true.
take it outside.
you need to grow up.
Hey, Mr. B.
anybody else get arrested
not that I know of.
listen, Ange, you know the napkin you drew for Vorstenbach
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I didn't know what he wanted it for. - No, I know that.
it's just, why wasn't it finished
Oh, well, I got interrupted.
interrupted? By who? - By Jared.
he came in to ask me out.
Jared saw Vorstenbach and the napkin
Mm-hmm.
right.
you see Max?
Yeah, um, table 11.
Hey, as soon as the crew gets here, we'll do a sound check.
that's great.
what time you want us to go on
midnight. You got it, give or take.
so, the cops think I committed the murder.
the cops are the least of your worries.
make the payment. - Right.
you know, you tell the Gravedigger, unless he's willing to kill me, it's over.
Oh, one more thing.
anything happens to my wife, it's you I'm coming after.
Oh, me? I'm just the messenger. Right.
you know, I don't know how you got Jared to believe that crap, but my gut is telling me you're nobody's messenger.
it's only money.
I hate when people say that.
so did the police try to convince you I was having an affair with Arastoo
that's what they do, you know.
drive wedges.
but it wouldn't be irrational to think I was having an affair with him.
he's very handsome.
Yeah, I'd feel it if the energy was bad between the two of us.
I'd know.
same way that you would know that I couldn't murder someone.
I believe you would murder someone for me.
and I believe you'd lie about it, so I wouldn't have to carry the burden.
Hey, Nikki, Vince. What's up
excellent update on the lid, Mick.
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hello, hello, hello.
check, check, check.
listen, go bigger, go louder or just go home.
how did you convince them to leave Cruefest and appear here tonight
benefit for the kids.
we're doing a benefit for sick kids
poor Cam and Jared.
if this murder is any indication,
I don't know how any homicide is ever solved.
everyone lies, everyone has a secret agenda.
I'm glad we're nightclub owners and not crime-solvers.
I know who did it.
so do I.
awesome, it's the Crue.
I've been bounced by a rock band.
when did you realize it wasn't me
you would kill for me, I know that, but whoever did this, knocked him out then went and got my coat before executing him.
you would never do that.
Jared is different.
my brother killed a man to save my wife.
what are we going to do?
do? Thank him and shut up.
Bren, this is murder.
it's more like a rescue.
God, everything is just so clear to you.
it is this time.
I don't think I can live with this.
boss.
I'm not going to prison.
GPS puts you in this building at the time of the murder.
Hey, I told you-- no cell phone, no GPS.
you should have listened to me.
lose the weapon, Detective.
Jared, just take out your gun.
Oh, that's exactly what I'm going to do.
you ready?
I'm a quick bastard.
by the barrel, very slowly.
that's not how it's going to go.
we know how this is going to go.
it's okay.
it's all okay.
thank you.
you helped us.
now please let us help you.
please welcome Motley Crue!
put the handcuffs on, Jared.
you love someone, you open yourself up to suffering.
that's the sad truth.
maybe they'll break your heart.
maybe you'll break their heart and never be able to look at yourself in the same way.
those are the risks.
locking up, boss.
Thanks, Wendell.
you know, I think...
I think you're right, you know.
we should sell out.
you're not afraid of this Gravedigger person
no.
I told him if he doesn't leave us alone, I'd kill him, and he believed me.
you mean, you told Max to tell him.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Caroline says if they can't trace the gun to Jared, they can't find my coat, he's going to walk.
we can't sell the club.
your brother might need a job.
Plus, I have another confession.
what
you see two people and you think they belong together, but nothing happens.
well, you know that glass of wine that we share every night
Yeah.
I have to stop that.
Oh, come on, Bren.
just because you have one glass of wine every night with your husband, doesn't mean you're an alcoholic.
that's not why.
no.
yeah !
you are pregnant
a little baby boy, huh
or girl.
the thought of losing so much control over personal happiness is unbearable.
that's the burden.
like wings
they have weight.
we feel that weight on our backs, but they are a burden that lifts us.
burdens that allow us to fly. ...Allow us to fly.
it was such a weird dream.
you're awake.
so real.
your operation was a success, but you reacted poorly to the anesthesia.
you've been in a coma for four days.
it took you so long to wake up.
it felt so real.
it wasn't real.
who are you?
okay, so the guy here says he was out doing routine track maintenance and saw the bones, he thought it was a deer.
human dentition is completely different.
another example of our country's deplorable educational system.
all right, until every kid becomes a dentist, we have some psycho throwing a hacked-up body out of a speeding train.
no. These bones were under the train.
if body parts had been thrown out a window, they'd be scattered in nearby foliage.
level of decomp suggests the remains have been exposed to the elements for at least two months.
drunk? Suicide?
conjecture. There's evidence of sharp-force trauma on the sternum.
stabbed. - More conjecture.
beaten. - Would you please stop that?
come on. It's a beautiful day, Bones. We must enjoy conjecture.
there's a distinct lack of hemorrhage.
this victim was dead before being hit by the train.
all right, so, someone killed him, dumped him on the tracks in hopes of trying to make it look like a suicide.
well, I can't determine motive, but I can say the train dragged the victim, and his body broke up as it smashed against the rails and ties.
we're saying the bones and the body gunk were scattered along the track here?
Yeah. For miles. Yes.
all trains should be diverted from this track until we locate the rest of the remains.
but do you know how much chaos that's going to cause Amtrak?
well, I told you, Booth. I'm not interested in conjecture.
you know, when I was a kid, Bones, I always wanted to be a hobo.
I wanted to ride the rails, play the guitar...
be malnourished, riddled with preventable disease.
tell you what. You know what? You could make Santa Claus cry. You really could.
Hey, you're wearing your belt buckle again. Cocky.
Yeah. Ever since the whole coma thing,
I just kept staring at it, thinking to myself, "Why would I wear something like this?"
cause you love it. You always have.
Yeah, that's what I landed on, Bones.
well, I'm glad you did. I like it. It's... it's Boothy.
Boothy? - There's a bone cyst on this femur.
the result of the parasite Echinococcus granulosus.
it's extremely uncommon in the U. S.
immigrant, illegal.
sorry. No conjecting. I'm just being Boothy.
so, what do you got there?
pelvis is male.
partial epiphyseal fusion indicates the victim to be in his teens.
he was just a kid.
the markers on these bones are anomalous, even for an immigrant.
I'd like to get them back to the lab to run some tests.
all right, well, hold on, Bones.
FBI Forensics can continue the search.
I'll send Clark to supervise.
bones, time-out. Hold on.
you might want to take the skull back there that my people are holding.
so, you and Perry going to get something to eat after the library?
probably. - Okay. But promise me you're going to...
call if I'm going to be late, I know. - Sorry. New mom.
it's okay.
Oh, um, I wanted to ask you, you know that dance this weekend?
the... formal? - Yeah.
Perry and I thought it might be fun to, you know, make a whole night of it.
like, we'd rent a limo and go to breakfast in the morning and...
the whole night? Where would you sleep?
we wouldn't. That's the point.
so, you and Perry would be spending the night together, not sleeping?
why do you say it like that?
just thinking it through. That's all.
Oh, Here's Perry. I thought you liked Perry.
well, I do, but... - You feel... You'll think about it?
Yeah.
Hey,'Chelle. Dr. Saroyan.
cam, Perry. Call me Cam.
Bye, guys. - Bye.
flora! Oh, Clark, you shouldn't have. I presume that is for me.
Yeah, knock yourself out.
Brennan said she found a skull, so...
I can give you a face. - Yeah. It's right here.
complete with perimortem fractures on the parietal.
looks like the victim was badly beaten.
Hey, Brennan said this was a teenager, right?
Yeah. These clothing scraps look hand-stitched.
like his mom made them.
that makes it sadder somehow.
Where's Dr. Brennan?
she's doing an isotope analysis.
she thinks the victim might be from another country.
Oh, that makes sense.
his cavities suggest that his drinking water wasn't fluoridated.
when do teenagers start having sex? - Hello!
if they could, they'd start in the morning and go until they drop.
please tell me this is about the case.
this is about Michelle, isn't it? Is she having sex?
working here is like being on The View. - No. I meant "what age"?
Dr. Saroyan, um, may I be excused to attend to something more... case-related?
Oh, Dr. Brennan already requested that you suit up to supervise the FBI techs' retrieval - of the remains at the train tracks. - Wait.
Dr. Brennan wants me to put on a jumpsuit and walk along a railroad track?
that is not a good look on a brother.
I bet you were an early starter, weren't you, Clark?
a prodigy, maybe?
um, in case you haven't heard, um, Miss Montenegro, I have, uh, work to do.
so, excuse me.
no pesticides. No evidence of processed foods.
the kid's from the boonies.
no, it's more significant than that, Booth.
our victim grew up with no bone markers that indicate modern life.
no evidence of contact with electricity or petrochemicals.
fine. Then we're back to an immigrant. Maybe a developing nation.
no. Isotopic analysis of his bone matches the geology of the Mid-Atlantic states.
I don't get it. - Well, neither do I.
our victim was a teenage boy who died about two months ago, but according to the data, he grew up in the early 1800s.
I... discovered the origins of our victim's markers.
what? Discovered what? Markers. Great.
he wasn't from the 19th century.
I took dual X-ray absorpitometry scans of the pelvic bone and then computed...
I trust your methods, Dr. Brennan.
you can just skip to the conclusion.
our dead teenager was Amish.
Amish, like buggies and hats Amish? - Yes.
then let's call Booth. Maybe something will turn up on Missing Persons.
he's already checking. I'm going to meet him.
is that a cartoon rendering of a penis in your book?
why, I guess it is. Look at that.
why is it talking? - Isn't Booth expecting you?
it's cute.
so, Levi Yoder's parents filed a missing persons report about two months ago.
kid's a ringer for Angela's sketch.
he was probably on his rumspringa.
that would explain the DMV photo.
well, what do you mean?
Amish don't drive while living in their community.
no, I mean, uh, rum... rum what?
Rumspringa.
it translates to "running around."
that's crazy. - No more crazy than your religion.
Hey, look, we reject Satan, and... they reject buttons.
rumspringa is a quite rational way to help teens make an informed decision as to whether or not to be baptized into the Amish faith as adults.
right, take a bunch of sheltered kids and set them loose-- recipe for disaster, if you ask me.
well, actually, over 85% of Amish teens return and become full members of their church community.
Really?
how many baptized Catholics are still practicing their faith in adulthood?
here we go with the Catholics again. You know what?
I don't want to hear about the Pope's hat... again. Okay?
he's got to wear it just like, you know, the guys in front of Buckingham Palace have to.
well, it's quite ornate for a vow of poverty. Don't you think?
we're very sorry for your loss.
I tried to protect him.
I told him the English world was dangerous and seductive.
well, where did he go? - Washington.
he went with another boy, Josef Beachy.
so, then, he wasn't really missing.
not at first. He promised to call us once a week to check in.
there's an English family down the road that let us use their phone.
then the phone calls stopped.
I spoke to Josef's parents.
Josef told them that he and Levi hadn't been living together for quite some time.
we contacted the police and filed a missing persons report.
the last time you spoke to your son, did he seem disappointed or sad about anything?
no. He sounded alive. Happy.
would it be all right if we took a look in his room?
okay, the good news is that this span of track only uses southbound trains, which means the body most likely came from the north.
and the bad news?
well, we're still missing a lot of body parts.
and north of this section, there are multiple switch points where the tracks branch out into dozens of other lines.
Clark's looking at a lot of hot hours under the sun.
okay. Send him the routes he has to search.
what's going on with Michelle?
Michelle has this boyfriend, Perry...
Oh, I met him. He's a hottie.
who's a hottie? - Perry. Michelle's boyfriend.
Yeah, sure. If you like athletic, confident, young...
studly. - Okay. Let's not say "studly," please.
do you have something for me?
Yeah, that vine on the bones-- it's kudzu.
the growth rate suggests the body parts had been undisturbed for approximately two months.
so, the victim must have died shortly after the last time he spoke to his parents.
perry's a senior, isn't he?
you know, that might be why he's pressuring Michelle to have sex.
why do you think he is pressuring her?
women want sex just as much as men.
Yeah, well, she's a child. She still has stuffed animals.
well, I did, too, at 16. And I also had Brian.
all you can do is tell her to respect herself and use protection.
during the Crusades, knights used to lock up their wives and daughters.
how helpful. Anything else, Hodgins?
and let's try something case-related this time. - Right. Yes. May I?
so, the victim's bones,
they were covered in a sedimentary rock dust comprised of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, so as indicated, he was most likely hooked beneath a coal car.
well, that eliminates the need for me to search for passenger-only trains.
which means I can focus on which lines used coal cars.
Hey, listen, Cam, every teenager goes through this.
think about what you went through. - Yeah. Me? Oh, God!
wh-what am I gonna do?
well, there's no posters, there's no video games.
tell you what, if I was a teenager, I'd want out of this place, too.
nice quilt, though, huh?
what do we have here, huh?
what is this, some kind of an Amish thing, Bones?
rock collection. I don't, I don't think so.
Mrs. Yoder, do you have any idea why your son would keep these under his bed?
no. I've never seen those before.
right. We should get these to Sweets. Take a look at.
Why? Hodgins would be the one to know if stones would have any evidentiary value.
a kid hides rocks underneath his bed. They're gonna mean something.
not to Hodgins. Here.
that photograph of Levi, is it possible for me to keep it?
the Amish don't use cameras.
she probably doesn't have any other pictures of her son.
Yeah. Of course. Here you go.
okay, that's great. Thanks.
so, listen, the FBI is tracking down the address for this Josef kid.
we'll have it in a few.
hello there.
are you here about Levi?
were you two friends? - Sarah.
you're needed at home. - Well, clearly she's busy right now.
no, please, it's okay. It's my brother.
I have to go. - Sarah!
excuse me. Listen.
if you need anything, here's my card. You can call me any time.
Sarah, now!
the males are clearly dominant.
Yeah, clearly. Look. So we got the address for Josef Beachy. Here we go.
Josef Beachy! FBI! Open up!
seriously, I yelled "FBI," and you opened up the door holding that?
you were, uh... There's nothing going on here, Officer.
you're holding a bong!
Josef Beachy? - Yeah, that's me.
come on. You're coming with us. Come on.
this is not in the proper spirit of rumspringa! - Bones!
levi moved out a few months ago. I haven't seen him since.
well, we were told you were going through your rumspringa together.
why would he leave?
parties weren't his thing.
that's kind of what rumspringa's for, right?
cut loose, go a little crazy.
getting busted for smoking weed.
it's supposed to be a time to contemplate your future faith.
well, yeah.
I was seeing how in the future I wouldn't want to smoke weed.
maybe Levi threatened to tell your parents that you were a stoner, and you had to stop him.
look, man, Levi had his own secrets.
no way would he risk telling on me.
what kind of secrets?
I don't know, but he used to disappear for hours, never tell anyone where he was going.
even back home, there were times he'd tell his folks he was at work, but I knew that that wasn't true.
do you know where Levi went after he moved out?
uh, like I said, we didn't really keep in touch.
you know, I know I will end up going back to the church.
I just got to get all the wild out, but Levi...
he always seemed like he had other plans.
are those the rocks from the victim's room? - Yup. Just finishing up now.
what are you doing?
Oh, Booth asked me to take a look.
at rocks? That is so my domain.
meaning you found something?
depends how you define something.
I mean, all rocks are a tangible representation of the awe-inspiring passage of time - on this tiny planet that we call... - Hodgins.
they're your basic Paleozoic era metamorphic rocks.
they're the kind of rocks that you clear away when you're plowing a field, so there's nothing distinguishing about them whatsoever, except for the awe-inspiring passage of time thing.
what about the feathers?
uh, eastern bluebird. They're a pretty common songbird.
guys, I think I know what these are.
there are 88 of these. 52 relatively light in color. 36 dark.
okay. - Piano.
you think this is a piano?
for Fred Flintstone, maybe. - No. Like a practice keyboard.
you've seen them. I used to use one when I took lessons.
Plus, the songbird feathers are further signifiers of music.
he kept it hidden under his bed because Levi was ashamed.
the Amish aren't supposed to play musical instruments.
so then, where does a kid like Levi learn about pianos?
well, Booth said that he had a job in town, right?
every small town has at least one piano teacher.
I'll tell Booth.
what are you doing?
playing the theme to Titanic.
even not hearing it, I hate that song.
not the way I play it.
were you able to get some photos of brake rigging?
Yeah, I got them.
I got the photos, got the bones, I got bit by God knows what kind of bugs out there.
Oh, perhaps Hodgins can identify them for you.
trauma is consistent with his body lying face up as an exposed gear lever hooked him in the sternum.
have you found the cause of death yet?
no, not yet. There's evidence of perimortem fractures, but until I get more bones, I won't be able to see a pattern.
Dr. Bernard covered all the tracks between the bridge and the, uh, switch point.
well, we're still missing over 60% of the vertebrae.
not to mention a number of extremities.
animal scavengers must have made off with the rest of the bones.
you have to regroup the tech team and start another search, this time focusing on secluded brush areas within 50 yards on either side of the tracks, where animal feeding sites would likely appear.
actually, I'm more of a lab rat, Dr. Brennan.
perhaps somebody more outdoorsy would be better.
Clark, if there's spinal damage that corresponds to the compression fractures on the lung bones, we could have cause of death. I need those bones.
you're the most qualified. Don't scratch your neck with the gloves.
well, is it all right if I get a drink of water, boss?
you know, uh, it's awful hot out there, and the tools are mighty heavy.
of course you can get water. Why are you talking like that?
never mind. I'm going.
I'm... going.
Michelle! What are you doing here?
we got out early for an assembly, so...
come in. Sit down.
Oh, thanks.
I was wondering.
have you had a chance to think about the dance?
Michelle, are you having sex?
excuse me? - It's no big deal. I just...
well, no, it is a big deal. It's a really, really big deal.
this is none of your business.
it is. I'm your legal guardian, Michelle.
Oh, so you can just boss me around any way you want?
no. I think I'm understanding, but sex... sex is...
well, when two people have sex, when the body is secreting hormones...
when men and women and sex are...
some people believe that God will smite you.
just a thought.
you're not my mother.
I know, Michelle. I...
I love you, and I don't want to see you get hurt.
your only job was keeping me out of foster care after my father died, d you did that.
so don't pretend there's anything more. - Michelle...
I've got homework. - Michelle...
that was only his third lesson. He was playing Handel by ear.
I had to record it. I was so flabbergasted.
so, Mrs. Tuner, you said that, uh, Levi worked for your husband?
in construction, yes.
uh, Levi brought some receipts to our home a couple years ago, and I was with a student, and she was practicing Fur Elise.
Beethoven.
I took a few piano lessons, but, you know, all thumbs, so couldn't quite work it out.
levi was fascinated, so I invited him to watch.
and after my student left, I suggested Levi touch a few keys.
well, he was shy.
but once he sat down, the boy was a natural.
you started giving him lessons?
I never charged him. He was a prodigy.
Mrs. Turner, during these secret lessons, did you notice if he was conflicted at all?
Oh, my, yes.
I encouraged him to use his rumspringa to decide whether his love of music was strong enough for him to consider leaving his faith.
did you keep in contact with him?
for a while. Then I never heard from him anymore.
this was the last thing Levi sent me.
he wanted me to know that he had made friends.
they were helping him to audition for the National Conservatory, and he seemed so excited.
it's just not fair that he's gone.
such a gift.
okay, we know he was in D. C. but it would be helpful to have an area of town to focus on.
okay, I'll see if I can locate any distinctive architectural markers outside the windows.
okay, Karen, let's switch.
Hey, Tony, do the Mozart.
Mozart? - Yeah.
you can hear them call each other Karen and Tony.
these are some talented kids.
these buildings have Queen Anne detail like a corbeled cornice.
most of the older neighborhoods have these. I'm going to need more.
okay, Levi, do your audition piece.
he's adorable.
did you hear that? That noise in the background?
maybe we don't need architectural markers.
the train.
architecturally, these buildings could be in one of six neighborhoods.
but this building here is the only one that's right next to the train track.
I'll triangulate the structures outside the windows and bingo, there's the apartment building.
it's so sad. - Poor kid.
so, that's, uh, your apartment in the video, isn't it?
levi lived in some party place. I had room.
my building's not the greatest but it was better than where he was living.
so, how did you two know Levi?
it was about six months ago, Karen and I were walking by one of the practice rooms of the conservatory.
we heard this piano, it was so beautiful.
Levi, he'd snuck in to play.
one thing just led to another, and we sort of adopted him.
I had this gold medal, not real gold, just something I'd won at a music competition when I was a kid.
but to Levi, it was the most beautiful thing ever.
so, I gave it to him for good luck.
I guess it didn't work very well.
how come you didn't file a missing person's report when he disappeared?
we just figured he'd changed his mind about the conservatory and gone back to his family.
why would you think that?
his dad had come to see him and probably convinced him to come home.
Amish don't approve of playing music.
hold on. His dad was there?
a few days before Levi was supposed to audition,
I went to the apartment and when I left, I saw a full-on Amish guy heading towards the building.
and I tried to introduce myself, but he just ignored me.
he seemed pretty pissed, to be honest.
how dare you accuse me of harming my own son?
Mr. Yoder...
I would never raise a hand to my boy!
not even if your livelihood was at stake?
levi was your only child.
I-I can see the arthritis in your metacarpals and phalanges.
you needed a son's help to keep this farm going.
you found out about the audition, you and Levi fought, there was an accident.
you took his body to the tracks...
how can you say those things to me?
you think this farm is more important to me than my own son?
he was my son!
my husband hasn't left this farm in over two years.
what are you talking about? What audition?
for the National Conservatory.
a conservatory?
your son was an extraordinarily gifted classical musician.
no. There are no instruments here.
I know, that's why your son had to sneak into town for lessons.
we would've known something like that.
not if he knew you'd disapprove.
so he ran away because he couldn't trust us?
I don't believe he had anything to do with it.
what, your gut again?
I'm a father, he's a father.
okay, it's something you just wouldn't understand.
would you advise Parker that sexual intercourse at age 16 is a wise decision?
what? How did you know that? Wait, what are we talking about?
Michelle. Cam is afraid Michelle is having sex.
Oh, no, that's not good.
well, you just said that you were having sex when you were 16!
Mm-mmm, that's different. - Oh, so there's a double standard?
of course. You know what? Cam needs to shut that down. Finished.
I said that Michelle should wait until she's at least 17-and-a-half.
is that how old you were?
no, I was 22. - Twenty-two?
well, don't.-- why do you sound shocked?
no, it's just... That's a good age. Twenty-two?
it was an important decision. I gave it a lot of thought.
I finally found a man who could provide a skillful introduction and...
okay, you make it sound like it was a class that you took.
all right, you know, the first time you should be in love.
you know, totally... "goo-goo" for the other person.
were you when you were 16?
well, part of me was.
and if Michelle feels this way, do you think she should be having sex?
no, Michelle should not be having sex until she's 22.
yeah? - Yeah, there's someone here to see you.
she just spent hours on a bus by herself.
says she only wants to talk to you.
levi and I, we were in love.
a few months before he left Lancaster, we started courting.
did you know why he was going to D. C?
music.
I thought it was important he get it out of his system before we married.
did you stay in touch with him while he was in the city?
he wrote me letters.
he talked about going to the conservatory.
I began to worry I'd lost him.
I shared my fears with my brother, Amos.
I'm afraid now that was a mistake.
your brother, Amos, has a temper, doesn't he?
it's been a struggle for him.
did he get upset with you when you talked to him about Levi?
Yes. I told him how close we'd been.
sexually? - No!
levi and I, we didn't do that.
but I don't think Amos believed me.
about two months ago, he left for the day.
said he had some business to do.
do you think he was going after Levi?
I'm not sure.
but shortly after that, Amos told me that I should try to forget about Levi.
that he might never come back.
and then when I didn't hear from Levi again, I just...
it's okay.
I love my brother.
I hate to suspect him of something so awful.
but I had to tell someone.
why are there two massive train wheels blocking the loading dock?
they're filled with dried, mangled body bits and bones.
Dr. Brennan wants me to examine them for defensive wounds.
only she didn't ask you to bring in the whole train.
we may have cause of death.
Karen Lin's apartment is on the fourth floor of the building.
underneath the balcony in the alley is a Dumpster.
now, I swabbed the perimortem fractures on the victim's skull.
I found a powder coating similar to the type used on industrial-strength Dumpsters.
I identified the perimortem ring fracture on the base of the skull as well as the corresponding damage on the top of the spinal column.
those injuries indicate that the victim fell from Karen Lin's balcony and then landed headfirst into the lid of the Dumpster, thereby severing his spine.
FBI techs confirm that the Dumpster has a dent consistent with our scenario, as well as residue of dried blood on the steel, which matches Levi Yoder.
anything linking the assault to Karen Lin or her boyfriend?
no. That's why I should start digging the remains out of the train wheels.
levi abandoned my sister after courting her.
what kind of brother would I be if I didn't try to intercede?
I told him his rumspringa was over.
that it was time to do the right thing and come home to Sarah.
that's it?
he said that there was something pulling him away.
he felt possessed.
music?
how could he leave my sister for something so frivolous?
and you wanted to hit him.
I shook him.
I grabbed him and I shook him and it was shameful.
I apologized.
then he tried to explain. He played something for me.
I never heard anything like it.
it was called "Clair de Lune."
and it,
something that beautiful, I have to believe that it came from God.
hmm, and that's not what your religion says.
I cannot pretend to know what the Lord has planned for any of us.
that's the greatest sin, you know?
speaking for God.
I told Levi that I would make sure that Sarah was looked after.
and that's it?
no.
he was going to be my brother.
I hugged him.
and then I left.
I didn't mean what I said. I know you care.
Oh, it's okay. I...
I handled things badly, I guess.
can I sit?
I think so.
look, Michelle, I...
this is all new to me, too.
so, I'm sorry if we got off on the wrong foot.
my dad always wanted me to be independent.
to think for myself, you know?
and you talked to him about boys?
are you kidding? How weird would that be?
did you talk to your dad about boys?
Oh, God, no. No, my mom told him to go bowling.
she knew he'd have a meltdown.
my dad still thinks I'm a...
his little girl.
I didn't know. Never had a mom.
so, you and Perry...?
no.
he wants to, but he's not pressuring me or anything.
but I'm scared. Is that weird?
I mean, it's just sex, right?
it's all over the TV and everywhere.
whoa, there's no such thing as just sex, Michelle.
every time, you give a bit of yourself to the person you're with.
so, it's okay to wait. As long as you want.
but I don't want to lose Perry.
if Perry doesn't understand how you feel, he doesn't deserve you.
I wanted to talk to you. I really did.
but I just didn't want you to be disappointed in me.
Oh, Michelle.
that's what I was afraid of, too.
have you found anything pertinent on the bones you found in the wheels?
I'm still reassembling the fragments from the right foot, but the left arm and hand are all there.
the fractures on these phalanges, there's barely discernible rounding along the edges.
the fractures occurred before Levi was killed.
whatever injured him was most likely a flat object with a straight edge.
wait, how much force would it take to do something like that?
hmm, about 120 pounds per square inch.
Hey, the keyboard lid could've exerted that much force.
it could've happened when he was practicing at the conservatory.
so, someone breaks a piano player's hand a few days before his big audition.
there was only one place available at the conservatory.
Tony was already in, but Levi was competing with Karen for the spot.
which means that she had motive to try to sabotage his audition.
she accidentally injures him, hoping that he'll slink back to Amish Country.
and when that doesn't work, she kills him.
agents have picked up Karen Lin and are bringing her to the FBI.
I'll pack everything up.
all right, I'll go get the car.
don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.
Perry, right? Michelle's boyfriend?
Yes, sir, Perry Wilson. Michelle's with Cam. She told me to wait here.
FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.
F... FBI? - Michelle's, uh, family to me.
I'm her number one uncle.
really, sh-she didn't mention...
in fact, I'm also a trained sniper.
okay, wow.
listen, Perry, all right.
you're a red-blooded, young man, and, uh, Michelle is a, you know, she's an attractive young girl.
so, I assume that you, uh... - What?
No! No, no. - All right. Because Michelle deserves your respect.
you understand? - I do. I do respect her.
we were just gonna go to a movie tonight.
all right, and if you behave any way less than a gentleman towards her, I'll find you.
I think we understand each other, right?
Yes, sir.
Michelle, hi! We were just talking about what you were doing tonight.
Yeah, we're going to the movies.
just a movie. That's all, movie.
Hey, Bones, um, you've met Perry, Michelle's boyfriend.
Yes. Nice to see you again. I heard about Princeton.
you have a very bright future ahead.
I hope so. - Me, too. You have fun tonight, okay?
sniper. Good man.
so, you were competing with Levi for a spot at the conservatory.
no, I wasn't.
my grandfather used to be a dean, and I've been taking private lessons there since I was six.
so, my admission had nothing to do with the audition process.
yet you were the only pianist in your class.
Yeah, because none of the other applicants were good enough to get in this year.
sure Levi would've gotten in. I mean, he was better than everyone.
he was better than me.
did you see Levi at the conservatory the day before he disappeared when his hand got smashed?
his hand? I-I have no idea wh...
someone crushed his hand, Karen. Didn't want him to audition.
he died at your apartment. You were the last person to see him alive.
this is crazy!
he wasn't even there the last time that I went.
his stuff was there, but his money was gone.
how do you know his money was gone?
levi didn't trust banks, and I had this old rolltop desk with a secret drawer in it and that's where he kept his money and it was gone.
but his stuff was still there?
Yeah, I just, I figured that if his father made him come home, then he wanted to leave everything from this life behind.
guaranteeing you a place at the conservatory.
I was trying to help him get in!
I picked his audition piece.
I could never hurt Levi. I loved him.
you loved him? Did your boyfriend know that? Right, maybe he just liked him out of the way.
Tony wasn't even around the weekend that Levi disappeared.
you can ask his parents.
he was at his grandma's funeral.
I'm not gonna say anything else.
I don't have to. I'm not saying anything.
FBI techs found a grand piano at the conservatory with bits of dried flesh and blood inside the keyboard lid.
what about the fingerprints?
there were some partials on the lid directly above the spot where Levi's left hand was broken.
we still have Karen Lin in custody.
we can get her prints for comparison.
don't need to, we already have a match.
the prints are Levi's.
levi broke his own hand?
that's what the evidence says. - Thanks, Cam.
levi broke his own hand? It's not logical.
if Levi decided to move back to his family, he wanted to remove all temptation, so he wouldn't change his mind.
you-you seriously think that he was choosing his religion over his music?
or maybe it was just over this girl, Sarah.
I mean, either way it makes sense.
no, it doesn't! To destroy a gift like that for a girl or religion, it's awful.
and it-it still doesn't give us a killer.
wait a minute. Money, what about the money?
what if this was all about the money? - What money?
the money. Levi's cash we never found.
the cash and that fake gold medal that Karen supposedly gave him.
did that ever show up? - Not yet, no.
the cash. What if this was all about the money?
come on, Bones.
it was a petty thief.
we arrested him in Baltimore.
several other residents in Karen Lin's building reported missing items right around the time that Levi died.
jewelry, silverware, cash.
so, it was just a robbery.
well, the thief was some stupid kid who hocked a bunch of stolen items about a month ago.
he also tried pawning the gold medal.
he didn't know it was fake.
the kid said that's what Levi was fighting for when he fell over the railing.
levi was just the wrong place at the wrong time.
guess that will certainly justify his parents removing themselves from the world.
can't blame them now.
but what Levi discovered...
the gift he had...
would their God really want them to deny their son that?
levi planned to return.
we thought it was important that you knew that.
he considered life outside the community, but he wanted to come home.
we brought you something.
I'm sorry, but we can't accept that.
in this case, I think God will understand.
Levi, if you want to get into the conservatory, you have to learn to perform.
you're amazing! - Our son.
it's so beautiful.
Sayler's Creek was the beginning of the end for the South.
we dug in and held you Yankees off for two days.
which is why we live in the Confederate States of America, I guess, right?
our boys had set up a perimeter along this here creek.
if we had been able to get supplies...
Oh, I hate to rub it in, Duval, but you rebels had more soldiers surrender at Farmville than in any other battle of the war.
you could always switch sides, you know, join the winners.
what the...?
what is this?
Oh, my God.
is that a dead soldier?
that's one of them Yankees we killed. Yankee?
that's a... That's a rebel yell if I've ever seen one.
he's screaming for his mother.
that's how you can tell he's a Yankee.
general Sheridan, we got a dead rebel over here, sir! No way!
dead Yankee...! Yes, we do!
dead rebel! Dead Yankee!
rebel! Yankee!
clearly a rebel! Clearly a Yankee!
is that work or Solitaire?
little brother, look at you. Hey.
how are you? What's going on?
Hey, good to see you.
I thought you were biking across India.
I was. You know what else? Ah.
I survived. Survived.
I biked through Sikkim.
I hiked to the top of Himachal Pradesh.
I even learned a few dirty jokes in Hindi. You want to hear one?
you didn't get yourself in any more trouble, did you?
not unless you count falling in love.
Wow. Falling in love. Really?
how?
I was swimming with elephants in the Andaman Islands, when out of nowhere, Padme swan dives off a cliff, nearly killing both of us.
it's a beautiful name, right?
I'm thinking of asking this girl to marry me.
you... Congratulations. That's...
I got to get that.
it's my special murder line.
okay, you... you go ahead and save the world.
all right, I'll, uh... I'll catch up with you later. All right.
Jared's only known her for a month. One month.
the Confederate soldiers at Farmville were so hungry, they scavenged seed and corn from horse excrement.
tasty. But who marries someone after a month?
Oh. I thought you believed in love at first sight.
only in movies, all right?
and not for Jared. Oh!
look at this.
what is with the red dirt?
well, the pine needles left behind tannic acid, which acts like red dye.
who are these guys? Well, he's right.
and years of tobacco farming drained the land of nutrient.
which caused the topsoil to wash away... Mm-hmm.
which left behind hard clay.
well, you're better informed scientifically than your apparel might suggest.
well, as amateur historians, we've studied this battle, the terrain, military maneuvers.
you don't say.
could you by any chance tell us if that's a fallen Union soldier, or a dead rebel?
the angle of the jaw indicates a male.
otherwise, I can't tell anything until we get the remains back to the lab.
all right, you know what? We're gonna need a backhoe.
and a cement cutter. And a cement cutter.
you really love the heavy machinery.
this trauma to the sternum is degraded.
it's as though the bone has demineralized over time.
maybe he got bayoneted, and then the clay leached out the calcium.
during the American Civil War, diseases such as typhoid fever, dysentery and tuberculosis killed twice as many men as battle wounds.
that could be relevant.
it is not. Why?
that was not a Civil War casualty.
reconstructive surgery.
titanium screws.
which were not introduced until the mid-sixties.
completely relevant to the matter at hand, I believe.
it's going to be very difficult to extract the remains from this clay without damaging the bones.
perhaps we could spray it with liquid nitrogen?
give it a short, sharp shock.
no. Freezing the clay with gas would make the bones brittle and could destroy evidence.
but as an idea, the fast-freezing option needed stating.
Whoa! What-What happened?
spiders.
I don't like spiders, and there are thousands of little spiders coming out of...
I'll go get Hodgins.
I really don't like spiders.
I don't mind them, actually.
the spider eggs were on the body before it was encased in the clay.
and the heat in the lab caused the eggs to hatch, and when you shone your flashlight, they headed for the light.
based on mandibular dentition, the victim is late 20s, early 30s.
Dr. Hodgins, I can, uh, still see one in his mouth. Yup.
these bad boys are Frontinella communis.
they're non-poisonous.
Yeah, still with those gross spider faces and legs, though.
this spider is not found in the area where the body was discovered.
indicating that the victim was most probably offed elsewhere.
any idea how to, uh, remove the body from the sediment?
well, I mean, if we remove the moisture from the clay, then it should just fall away without effecting the bones at all.
I just need four dehumidifiers.
you okay there, Dr. Saroyan?
Yeah, I'm just itchy all over.
I'm gonna go burn all of these clothes and maybe my hair.
some male spiders are known to actually... to pluck their webs, like a guitar, to attract the females.
someone should tell them, it's drummers that get the girls.
we were in Bangalore visiting the Karnataka Belur temple when a pickpocket stole my wallet.
Jared climbed onto the roof of the building and tackled the thief.
you know, all that hero stuff?
I learned it from my big brother.
that along with hotwiring cars and stealing cable.
Jared's very proud of you.
Yeah. What can I say?
you know, it's normal big brother stuff, that's all.
I'm amazed at how good your English is.
it's perfect.
that happens when you grow up in Alexandria, Virginia.
I'm third generation American.
Yes, you are. Thank you for setting me up and making me look like an idiot.
Yeah, it's just normal little brother stuff.
so, basically, you went all the way to India to meet a girl who lives down the street from you?
Seeley thinks every decision I make is wrong.
like you said, typical big brother.
Yeah.
so, what is it that you do for a living,
Padme? She's a bank robber.
it's a normal question, you know?
she's very glamorous.
I thought maybe she worked at some glamorous job.
hardly. I teach grade school.
Seeley's got a kid in third grade. His name's Parker.
there's no one named Parker at my school.
she's the kid's favorite teacher, Seeley.
phosphate and calcium have leaked from the bones into the clay in several places, making the bones softer and the clay harder.
I see you started with dentition.
interesting juxtaposition.
substandard dental work, but top-of-the-line materials.
I thought that might help with identification.
I've seen that before in people who get their treatment for free at a dental school.
suggesting that the victim was poor.
specious leap, Mr. Nigel-Murray.
tendonitis in his elbow.
the hook of the hamate shows wear from torque, rotational force and repeated tugging.
I only have inappropriate comments off the phrase "repeated tugging.
these are occupational markers for many professions, including funeral directors, surgeons, dentists, mechanics.
a dentist would most likely have his dental work done by other students, while in dental school.
that would explain the work on his teeth.
next, I'd like theories as to what might have caused the initial damage to the sternum.
E-Even though it's been severely degraded by demineralization?
Yes.
okay.
I'll have to remove the rest of the clay first.
Oh, I will get you to praise me, Dr. Brennan.
I will have you look at me with admiration and astonishment at my...
I'm sorry, Mr. Nigel-Murray.
were you speaking to me?
no, Dr. Brennan.
I was simply... I was running through my, uh, knowledge of clay.
you think your brother's girlfriend is hinky?
is that slang for pretty or buxom?
no, it's just slang for iffy.
well, iffy is already slang.
I don't see the need for slang for slang.
the point is, there was just a-a hinky vibe between me and her.
look, you know what?
I don't expect you to understand, Bones, though. Yeah.
the victim's dental records confirm his identity.
dentist. Lives alone.
are they happy together?
what? Jared and Padme.
do they seem happy?
you've put a high premium on feelings.
don't go twisting this around, Bones.
well, you used to think that people could find true love.
I still do, okay, but this is Jared, all right?
he only just got sober.
well, if he's sober, he should be able to find love.
I don't understand the rules.
Ah, there are no rules.
there's just life, okay?
there's just life.
big house for a single man.
looks like he's doing some serious remodeling, huh?
door's open. Hold on.
hands up.
no, no, no.
okay. Okay, this is not what it looks like.
I'm allowed to be here. Who are you?
my-my Social Security number is three-zero-eight, one-two...
okay, Mr. Pickford, what are you doing here?
I'm Danny's contractor.
I-I live over the garage.
he said I could come in any time and use his TV.
Danny is dead.
he's dead?
that's where he's been?
Oh, that's right. He's been dead.
I thought he just... met someone.
Danny once took off for three weeks and never said a word.
Ah, big-screen TV, cold beer-- it's not a great motive for murder, but I've seen people killed for less.
why would I kill Danny?
he owes me money-- like, three grand.
you shouldn't be hassling me.
you should talk to his ex.
they had a bad breakup.
right. What's her name? Chris.
but she's a him.
I mean, it's a...
christopher Chris, not a Christine Chris.
he rents a place on Dahlgren Road.
there's no faster way to clean the skeleton?
oddly, no.
not in a localized fashion.
Dr. Brennan seemed very anxious to get at the sternum.
uh, Dr. Saroyan, not to come across as in any way needy, but have you ever seen Dr. Brennan, um, compliment or praise one of us interns?
I wouldn't worry about praise, Mr. Nigel-Murray.
strive for mild approval.
then, back to work I go.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho. Did you...
clean the victim's teeth?
a small sign of respect for a dentist.
if you want praise,
I'd concentrate on the sternum if I were you.
something hit him there.
hard.
let's see if we can't figure out what that was and, uh, whether it killed him.
okay.
I worked two jobs to put Dan through dental school.
as soon as his practice was up and running, he dumped me.
and since Virginia doesn't recognize gay marriage or civil unions, you weren't entitled to anything when he left you.
how is that fair?
it's not.
I'm sorry to inform you that we have identified some human remains as Daniel Pinard.
wait.
uh, Dan is dead?
when was the last time you saw him?
I haven't heard from him, but...
it's got to be a year.
all right.
were you, uh...
were you upset when he broke it off with you?
what?
well, like you said, you...
you didn't have any legal options.
not upset enough to kill.
I moved on.
I met someone after a couple months, and bygones are bygones, right?
is that everything now?
because Danny was a part of my past, and like I said, I've moved on. Actually, no.
I'd like to ask you, uh, quite a few more questions, if you don't mind. I do mind, so, if you'll excuse me...
booth? Yeah.
what do you got there?
looks like an arrowhead.
is that yours?
I'm a bow hunter-- whitetail deer.
Yeah.
I'm gay and I hunt. Get over it.
that bow in his truck would generate sufficient velocity for this arrowhead to cause the trauma in the victim's sternum.
hmm. What is she saying?
basically, she's saying you have a choice.
either you come with us willingly and answer my questions or...
I arrest you.
the damage to the sternum is not the cause of death.
so, the ex-boyfriend's off the hook?
at a velocity of 82 meters per second, a hunting arrow would not only pierce the sternum and the heart, but would sever the spinal column.
I will point out, uh, however, that the angry ex-boyfriend might still have killed the victim, but either he didn't use a hunting bow or he-he made an amazing shot from the-the absolute... the limit of the bow's range, which-which would be... very far.
I sounded very much like Dr. Brennan then, did I not?
up until the "very far," yes.
what did strike our victim in the chest?
it could easily have been postmortem.
probably as a result of being tipped into a creek.
so, we don't have cause of death.
rhubarb.
uh, rhubarb?
uh, the victim was killed by rhubarb?
approximately ten kilos.
all right. I'm usually pretty good with following your jumpy little brain, but you've totally left me in the dust on this one.
if you can acquire for me the rhubarb,
I can deliver unto you a skeleton free of clay.
Rhubarb!
rhubarb it is.
okay, well, you know, our victim wasn't killed by an arrow.
Yeah.
but hey, you know, the good news
our victim's dental hygienist says that he gave her hepatitis C.
the dental hygienist is gay, too?
I don't know. I'm going to ask her.
her?
did the victim have heterosexual relations with his hygienist?
I don't know. I'm going to ask her.
miss Bryson, I'm Agent Booth.
they said Dan is dead.
what happened?
well, we were hoping that maybe you would be able to help us with that.
me?
how did you work this up without me?
when I told Dr. Saroyan that the sternum wound was not caused by a hunting arrow, my brain jumped to different types of arrows, which led me to the image of a giant wasp, which was silly, but which then led me to stinging nettles, which are covered in thousands of tiny little arrows, and on the tip of each tiny little arrow is a drop of oxalic acid, which not only stings, but works very well at dissolving silicates.
silicate causes clay to adhere...
and rhubarb is full of oxalic acid.
okay. Next time someone says your brain is a jumble of disconnected chaos, you just send them to me.
uh, people say that?
you need me to stir?
don't you have lots of spiders to trace?
well, there's over 30 separate breeding grounds within a 200-mile radius of the body site.
I'm analyzing the egg sacks to see if I can narrow it down further.
I've got some time.
and this is so cool.
you want to know if I had sex with Dan?
well, you filed a grievance against him requesting the ADA revoke his license because he gave you hepatitis C.
no, we didn't have sex.
Dan nicked me during a procedure. Really?
so, he nicked himself and you?
what about the patient?
it was while preparing a syringe.
my husband and I tested positive after that.
who believed that story?
did your husband believe that story?
it ha... it happened.
how did you really get hepatitis C?
tell you what, before you answer that question, this here's a report from the ADA saying that Dan never had hepatitis C.
I had an affair.
I... I got hepatitis C.
I just... I needed a way to explain it to my husband.
right, so maybe you killed Dan so your husband wouldn't find out the truth, or your husband did.
no. No, neither of those things happened.
on the day that Dan Pinard disappeared, he canceled all of his appointments so he could, uh, go see Dr. Hibbert.
only problem is, we can't find this Dr. Hibbert.
D-Dr. Hibbert is the name that Dan wrote in his appointment book when he canceled patients at the last minute.
any idea who it might have been that day?
I was already fired.
right.
you ran a background check on Jared's girlfriend? Well, yeah.
you do things like that for people you care about.
do you do that when I go out with someone?
look, Bones, you're the one who says not to jump to conclusions without all the facts.
but you always say, in matters of the heart...
Ah, the heart is just a muscle.
see? I'm learning from you, huh?
anyways, this whole background check came up hinky.
hinky how?
four years ago, this woman was an escort.
Jared's going to be crushed.
Why? I'm sure she possesses sophisticated sexual skills, and if she's reformed...
she's just... reformed? She's a reformed escort.
well, maybe Jared already knows.
no, he doesn't know.
how do you know he doesn't know?
because, if he knew, he wouldn't be talking about getting married.
he wouldn't be saying stuff like that.
Hey. Look what Vincent did.
he turned our victim into rhubarb pie.
fractures are evident on at least half a dozen bones, including possible cause of death.
hmm. Fracture to the glabellar region on the frontal bone.
head trauma could definitely be cause of death.
tendonitis of the shoulder, broken ribs, knee trauma and a nick to the ankle.
that's all just the right side. Sounds like he was tortured.
he also had Bennett's fracture of the thumb, broken left clavicle, and his knee... You know what?
these are all common football injuries.
some of the injuries are over a decade old, but others show almost no remodeling, which means...
he was still active in the sport.
a gay dentist who plays football.
do the significant looks you are exchanging mean that you doubt a gay man can play football and be a dentist?
no.
I mean, for me, the answer is no.
what I'm thinking is that American football is a bastion of testosterone- fueled masculinity.
maybe one too many lingering glances in the locker room got him in trouble.
well, does that happen often?
Yeah. I mean, with me, it happened all the time.
if I'd killed everyone who looked at me lustily,
I wouldn't have made it out of school.
there's only one amateur full-contact league in the DC area, so it wasn't hard to find out which team Dan played for.
well, they are not unlike mountain rams that butt heads in an attempt to attract a mate.
it's hard to believe that brain damage isn't a result.
it's amazing. You can even make football sound bad, Bones.
come on, ladies. My little sister hits harder than that.
Fillmore, do you want me to get you a skirt?
he's challenging their masculinity to enhance aggression. That's coach talk.
it's the way coaches talk.
let me handle this. Excuse me.
coach, FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.
this here is my partner, Dr. Temperance Brennan.
like to ask you a few questions about Dan Pinard.
Yeah, well, he better be in prison.
that's the only excuse I'll accept for how long he's been gone.
we found his body.
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
did any of Dan's teammates or opponents have any problems with him?
what, he was murdered?
no. Oh, no.
uh, all the guys loved Dan.
is it possible that someone's masculinity was threatened and that person killed Dan because he was a homosexual?
way to ease into that one, Bones. That's smooth.
no, that's definitely not an issue with my guys.
what makes your team so highly evolved, Coach?
meet the Cardinals, Agent Booth.
we're all gay.
good hit!
so, anybody here have any problems with Dan?
disagreements, arguments, fights?
everyone here joined this team because a lot of the straight players don't want us on their teams.
we're like family.
no one here hurt Dan.
no way.
and you're all gay?
Oh, I suppose, statistically, we could have two or three straights who are still in the closet.
booth, this is Dan's equipment bag.
I found his protective headgear inside.
that's a helmet, Bones.
there's blood on the inside of the lip.
it approximates the location of the fracture on Dan's forehead.
the force could have cracked his skull and killed him.
are you sure nothing happened here?
one of your guys, they probably could have hit Dan-- you know, in practice a little too hard, try to cover it up.
what are you saying? I mean, you lose your insurance, you're kicked out of the league.
but hey, it was just an accident, right?
all right, I'll tell you what.
anybody who's got plans for this weekend, just cancel 'em.
because of blood on a football helmet?
because of blood inside of a football helmet.
isn't that right, Bones?
that's correct.
I was draining the vat when I noticed these white things floating in the rhubarb stew.
spider eggs, right?
no.
no, the boiling water would have destroyed the eggs.
so what are they?
I have no idea.
always glad to sow confusion.
this man endured a remarkable amount of abuse.
it must have been tough.
Yeah, this ain't England, pal.
being gay in America is still a tough go.
I was referring to being a football player.
Yeah, I-I knew that.
four years ago
Jared's girlfriend was a hooker?
an escort.
I believe, in the hierarchy of prostitution, an escort ranks equal to "high-class call girl.
and now she teaches grade school?
I don't see any other injuries to the bone that could be cause of death.
that leads us back to the head trauma.
apparently the rule is: once a sex worker, always a sex worker.
you know, it really would have been better if Booth never ran her record.
he said it was my influence, that it was the rational thing to do.
no, sweetie, he's rationalizing, which makes what he did irrational because he's rationalizing that Jared cannot make rational decisions for himself-- you do the same thing all the time.
maybe that's what he learned from you.
in order to be fatal, whatever struck the frontal bone had to be pointed enough to pierce the brain.
now, wait a second.
is Booth going to tell Jared about this?
I believe that's his plan.
what if Jared and this woman are really in love?
booth could ruin everything.
well, not if, as Booth always asserts, love conquers all.
Yeah, well, this is going to be one hell of a test case.
I ran blood tests on the items in Dan's athletic bag.
I found evidence of someone else's blood.
football is a contact sport.
there are bound to be traces of other people's DNA on his uniform.
this was more than a trace, and it wasn't on his uniform.
it was all over his towel.
we ran it through CODIS and got a match.
32-year-old man named Sid Ziegler.
Ziegler is a firefighter and a former marine.
he lives in Greenbelt, Maryland.
he plays for one of the, the other teams in Dan's league.
one of the straight teams?
Yeah, was a big game.
Ziegler fumbles, the victim recovers, scores a touchdown, game over.
well, I doubt even a homophobe would kill for that.
Yeah, but a fight ensues.
Oh, so they fought?
if Dan won a physical altercation in front of both teams, then there-there's a certain personality type that might feel impugned enough to strike back.
go on. Gay guy beats up a certain type of straight guy, straight guy can't handle it.
well, see, that's what I wanted to know.
now, did the victim and Ziegler have any contact since their fistfight?
well, the two of 'em-- they played against each other in a game the weekend before Dan disappeared.
okay.
Hey, Seeley, your message sounded urgent.
what's going on?
uh... thanks for the gay insights.
you're welcome.
okay.
you got that big brother look all over your face, like the time you had to tell me the puppy I brought home was a rat.
uh, well, um, that sort of happened again.
okay, what the hell are you talking about?
there are some things that you need to know about Padme.
you ran a background check on my girlfriend?
no, she was arrested for prostitution four years ago.
shut up, Seeley, shut up.
the charges-- they didn't stick, but you need to know that she was an escort.
you just can't stand to see me happy, can you?
no, that's not true. If I were in your shoes,
I'd want to know if my girlfriend was hiding something.
no, you wouldn't.
okay, I have watched you for years.
I learned.
you would make your own judgment.
you wouldn't care what other people said.
you'd say exactly what I'm gonna say.
go to hell.
look, I called him a fag, the dude kicked my ass, end of story.
you got a problem with gays?
no, that was over a year ago.
look, what's this all about?
I'm trying to put together a sequence of events before Dan Pinard disappeared.
disappeared?
W-what do you mean "disappeared"?
we, uh, found your blood on his towel.
I-I cut myself during a game-- big gash on my leg.
Danny used his towel to stop the bleeding.
what do you mean "disappeared"?
he came up to you in the locker room and he presses that towel on your leg?
I thought...
I thought it was only me.
I thought Danny didn't want to see me anymore.
I-I called him, I went by his place a hundred times.
nothing.
why do you think he didn't want to see you again?
because, I mean, Danny had it all figured-- who he was.
I wasn't ready.
to come out of the closet.
for any of it.
that made Danny mad sometimes, you know, frustrated.
is Danny dead?
you, uh, you think I killed him.
Danny was, uh
the only time I've ever been happy was with Danny.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
I don't guess anyone would understand.
looks like cause of death to me. Cause of death, yes, yes, but I cannot discern the cause of the cause of death, so to speak.
okay, bugs and slime pal.
different discipline entirely, sorry.
there appear to be three separate fractures on the skull.
w-we couldn't see them before because all of the fracture lines connect.
okay, so the victim was hit three times instead of once.
Dr. Brennan thinks that the brain was pierced when the skull was hit.
brain piercing, yeah, sounds very death-causing to me.
the beveling on the exterior of the skull suggests that all three fracture points emanate from inside the skull.
his forehead exploded from the inside out.
again, very deathy.
wait a minute.
what would cause someone's forehead to explode from the inside?
I was hoping that you'd say it had something to do with those bulbous seedy jobbers that I thought were spider eggs.
no, I mean
Oh, wow.
wow?
what wow?
so Ziegler was a marine.
he gets married to a woman, it lasts six years.
Why?
why did his marriage last six years?
no, why did he get married?
well, most likely Ziegler was trying to conform to social norms.
in many cultures, homosexuality is revered.
anthropologically, it makes no sense for heterosexuals to be threatened by homosexuals because they are actually removing themselves from competition for mates.
right, so Ziegler forces himself to conform, and the dentist comes along and forces, you know, Ziegler to confront...
Ziegler couldn't come to terms with his sexual orientation, so when the victim elicited this flood of unwanted feelings in him, he transferred the self-loathing from himself to the victim.
native Americans believed that homosexuals were of two spirits, held them in high esteem.
so what's the problem?
it's no problem. Why are you looking at me like that?
I was a soldier. I mean, gay guys-- they saved my life in battle more than once.
so are you saying that if a former prostitute saved your life in battle, that would solve the problem with Jared's girlfriend?
what? Seriously, you're going to bring that up in front of Sweets right now?
it's a rational question.
I'm sorry, Jared's involved with a prostitute?
former, former prostitute.
bones. What?
Oh, did you run a background check on Jared's girlfriend?
okay, why is everybody saying that to me like it's some sort of terrible thing?
cause it's kind of terrible.
look, I'm just looking out for my brother, that's all, so can we just, you know, focus on the case?
Yeah, uh, well, the fact that the suspect carries in his wallet a photo of them together-- it doesn't really jibe with homosexual panic.
great, thanks, that's all I need to know.
I got enough.
Thanks, appreciate it, Sweets.
wow, that was...
I have to go, too.
thank you, Dr. Sweets, for your invaluable psychological insights into the human condition.
do you know what Vincent Nigel-Murray is?
he's a genius.
Yes, but so are we all, except for Angela.
Oh, right, and yet, who do you turn to when you need pretty pictures?
Dr. Hodgins figured out what caused the fracture to the frontal bone.
Vincent found these small particulates floating in the rhubarb stew, right?
well, I identified them as silica phytolith, which is a, a razor- thin, clear hard shell which protects seeds.
now, the victim was tossed into the creek bed where his body quickly decomposed.
flooding from the rain washed the clay and debris into that creek bed, which encased the body.
now, in all that muck, three periwinkle seeds became embedded within the victim's skull.
okay. It's called floral circumnutating.
over time, soft can become even harder than hard, like a sliver of grass that grows through cement.
the same kind of process that causes tree roots to destroy pipes.
so a seedling fractured the frontal bone?
three of them.
so head trauma was not cause of death.
we have no cause of death.
did she seem disappointed to anyone else?
she definitely seemed disappointed to me.
the pollen from the egg sack is from hickory pine trees.
but they don't grow where the body was found.
she didn't even want me to help her examine the bones.
okay, you're not listening to me.
Yes, the, um-- the-the keening shriek of intern anxiety is interfering with my hearing.
there is a slice on the medial malleolus.
Yes, uh, duly noted in my report.
but you didn't note what that might mean.
I would, uh, most definitely have done so, if-if
I had the slightest inkling of what it might mean.
whatever caused the nick on this bone must have cut the posterior tibia artery.
Oh, yes. Tissue.
um, posterior tibia artery... massive bleeding.
dude, you should totally just toss culpability onto Cam.
I need to know if the weapon that caused this left any trace in the bone.
well, Vincent's rhubarb stew completely washed away all the surface particulates.
see how that's done?
we can sand down the top layer of bones cells and analyze what lies beneath.
thank you.
my bad.
you can't blame Mr. Nigel-Murray.
the nick was on the bone, but I should've realized the implications for the flesh.
and I didn't.
I agree.
then why are you letting him worry that he's disappointing you?
Mr. Nigel-Murray should be aware by now that I don't hold others to my level of expertise.
otherwise I'd have no one to help me.
how would he know that if you don't tell him?
tungsten carbide, which is a compound used to coat various types of tools.
including dental tools.
I distinctly remember saying to you once, "Good job,
Mr. Nigel-Murray.
I'm saying it again now.
Cheers.
brilliant, that.
one of the suspects was Dan's dental hygienist...
Hey, where does she live?
Fairfax, Virginia.
okay, the pollen I found in the sheet weaver spider's egg sack came from hickory pine trees.
they don't grow where the body was found, but you can find them all over that part of Virginia.
motive, theoretical weapon, spiders.
that should be enough for an arrest.
so, according to Grace Bryson's statement, she and her husband were at a yoga retreat when Dan Pinard disappeared.
well, the retreat was in Silver Spring.
that's close enough to drive back, kill Dan and then return to the spa.
right. It could be both her and her husband.
when your gut speaks to you, do you think it could be an increase in stomach acid, due to anxiety?
huh?
I feel some anxiety.
okay, about what?
about your sudden abandonment of a belief system.
really, it's-it's making my stomach upset.
okay, you know what? You are really just, um
crack a window there, Bones. All right, just get some air.
you told me that my father's criminal past didn't matter.
that the love between us was real and that was all that mattered.
because I believed you, my father and I have a relationship today.
okay. I'm glad I could help out.
but I'm anxious because I can't see any meaningful difference between my father and your brother's girlfriend.
can you explain that to me?
it's a question of logic, so I'm just going to be quiet now while you work your way through it.
I already told you where I was, at the yoga retreat.
Yeah, we know that. But you would have had more than enough time to, uh, leave the retreat and return.
well, I didn't.
so, can you leave me alone?
after Dan fired you, you couldn't find a job, could you?
well, that wasn't Dan's fault.
that was the hepatitis.
ms. Bryson, do you own a set of dental tools?
well, I had to buy a set when I was in school. Why?
can we see 'em?
no.
not without a warrant.
when did you put in this driveway?
excuse me?
when were these paving stones laid?
a few months ago.
is there something illegal now about doing home improvements?
what's going on, Bones?
look at the stones.
well, you know these stones look just like the ones that were at Dan's house.
it's the same contractor.
Lucas.
I met him at Dan's office, before I was fired.
well, he said he had some extra materials left over from Dan's job and he could give me a deal.
that's a scam.
Lucas was reselling the supplies that Dan had already paid for.
well, I didn't know that.
was Lucas working on the driveway when you were at the yoga retreat?
Yeah.
he was finished by the time we got back.
was the fastest he ever finished anything.
we need to dig these up.
backhoe and a cement cutter.
the bottom of the paving stones are covered in blood.
all the samples I've taken are a match for the victim.
he bled out on the ground.
then it was paved over.
behold, Lucas Pickford's grout scraper.
he used it for installing the paving stones.
coated in tungsten carbide.
please tell me it's a match.
it is, in fact, a perfect match for the injury to the victim's ankle.
Yeah. Cheers.
brilliant. Hmm?
no, she didn't say anything.
I-I discerned a lovely
a little glint of approbation in her eye.
I-I admit it.
we had an argument.
about the paving stones?
Yeah. Did you call him something?
a vulgar slur for "homosexual?
in the heat of the moment, maybe.
I mean, but you should've heard what he was calling me!
Dan knocked me down and he started kicking me.
so I grabbed the-the scraper, and swung it at him to get him off me.
self-defense.
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
I-- I'll admit it.
it was self-defense.
Yeah, except, um, you didn't call 911.
no. You just watched him bleed to death, and then you dumped his body in a ditch.
if he charged me with theft,
I lose my contractor's license.
my whole livelihood.
for what?
a few dozen paving stones?
the guy attacked me for a few dozen paving stones.
you robbed him.
you lied about it, and you called him a "fag.
to him, that was a big deal.
I'm sure Jared wants to talk to you alone, Booth.
no, he asked for you to be here.
I really don't want to be in the middle of a fight.
I'm not going to fight. There's going to be no fighting.
I promise, all right?
so, you really think I was wrong?
I don't know if you were wrong.
but I fail to see the point of being right.
okay.
I've really been thinking about what you said.
what if I ruined it for him? What if he was really happy with her?
I imagine you would never forgive yourself.
Thanks.
well, on the bright side, he might totally ignore you.
great. Thank you.
well, perhaps Jared will think for himself.
isn't that all you've ever really wanted for him?
well... Hey, sorry we're late.
padme, this is Temperance Brennan.
this is my brother's partner, slash friend.
nice to meet you.
pleasure.
so...
here we are.
think we can talk outside, privately?
no.
whatever you want to say, you can say to both of us.
see, we don't have secrets, Seeley.
never did.
about anything.
I suspect Jared is implying that he already knew about Padme's past as an escort.
great, thanks, Bones. I got that.
Jared and I have come to grips with... everything.
Yeah.
so, the question is: Are you in or are you out?
I'm in. Good.
that's good, 'cause, uh,
I really wanted to know if you'd be my best man.
Wow.
so soon.
it's only been what, a month? Ow.
what?
temperance, she kicked me under the table.
pretty sure she was aiming for you.
definitely meant for me.
well, if that's true,
I like her.
I'd like to make a toast.
what is this?
it's her new thing. She likes to make
she's really good at making toasts, though.
maybe we should get some champagne, though.
no, Jared is an alcoholic.
no secrets.
when Booth and I first met,
I didn't believe that such a thing as love existed.
I maintained that it was simply brain chemistry.
but perhaps Booth is correct.
perhaps love comes first and then creates the reaction.
I have no tangible proof, but...
I'm willing to accept Booth's premise.
to love.
to love.
to love.
to love.
Sayler's Creek was the beginning of the end for the South.
we dug in and held you Yankees off for two days.
which is why we live in the Confederate States of America, I guess, right?
our boys had set up a perimeter along this here creek.
if we had been able to get supplies...
but you rebels had more soldiers surrender at Farmville than in any other battle of the war.
you could always switch sides, you know, join the winners.
what the...?
what is this?
Oh, my God.
is that a dead soldier?
that's one of them Yankees we killed.
Yankee? That's a... That's a rebel yell if I've ever seen one.
he's screaming for his mother. That's how you can tell he's a Yankee.
general Sheridan, we got a dead rebel over here, sir!
no way! - Dead Yankee...! Yes, we do!
dead rebel! - Dead Yankee!
rebel! - Yankee!
clearly a rebel! - Clearly a Yankee!
is that work or Solitaire?
little brother, look at you.
how are you? What's going on? - Hey, good to see you.
I thought you were biking across India.
I was. You know what else?
I survived. - Survived.
I biked through Sikkim.
I hiked to the top of Himachal Pradesh.
I even learned a few dirty jokes in Hindi. You want to hear one?
you didn't get yourself in any more trouble, did you?
not unless you count falling in love.
Wow.
falling in love.
Really? How?
I was swimming with elephants in the Andaman Islands, when out of nowhere, Padme swan dives off a cliff, nearly killing both of us.
it's a beautiful name, right?
I'm thinking of asking this girl to marry me.
you... Congratulations. That's...
I got to get that. It's my special murder line.
okay, you... you go ahead and save the world.
all right, I'll, uh... I'll catch up with you later.
all right. - Okay.
Jared's only known her for a month. One month.
the Confederate soldiers at Farmville were so hungry, they scavenged seed and corn from horse excrement.
tasty. But who marries someone after a month?
I thought you believed in love at first sight.
only in movies, all right?
and not for Jared.
Oh!
look at this.
what is with the red dirt?
well, the pine needles left behind tannic acid, which acts like red dye.
who are these guys? - Well, he's right.
and years of tobacco farming drained the land of nutrient.
which caused the topsoil to wash away...
which left behind hard clay.
well, you're better informed scientifically than your apparel might suggest.
well, as amateur historians, we've studied this battle, the terrain, military maneuvers.
you don't say.
could you by any chance tell us if that's a fallen Union soldier, or a dead rebel?
the angle of the jaw indicates a male.
otherwise, I can't tell anything until we get the remains back to the lab.
all right, you know what? We're gonna need a backhoe.
and a cement cutter. - And a cement cutter.
you really love the heavy machinery.
this trauma to the sternum is degraded.
it's as though the bone has demineralized over time.
maybe he got bayoneted, and then the clay leached out the calcium.
during the American Civil War, diseases such as typhoid fever, dysentery and tuberculosis killed twice as many men as battle wounds.
that could be relevant.
it is not. - Why?
that was not a Civil War casualty.
reconstructive surgery.
titanium screws.
which were not introduced until the mid-sixties.
completely relevant to the matter at hand, I believe.
it's going to be very difficult to extract the remains from this clay without damaging the bones.
perhaps we could spray it with liquid nitrogen?
give it a short, sharp shock.
no. Freezing the clay with gas would make the bones brittle and could destroy evidence.
but as an idea, the fast-freezing option needed stating.
Whoa!
what-what happened?
spiders.
I don't like spiders, and there are thousands of little spiders coming out of...
I'll go get Hodgins.
I really don't like spiders.
I don't mind them, actually.
the spider eggs were on the body before it was encased in the clay.
and the heat in the lab caused the eggs to hatch, and when you shone your flashlight, they headed for the light.
based on mandibular dentition, the victim is late 20s, early 30s.
Dr. Hodgins, I can, uh, still see one in his mouth.
Yup.
these bad boys are Frontinella communis.
they're non-poisonous.
Yeah, still with those gross spider faces and legs, though.
this spider is not found in the area where the body was discovered.
indicating that the victim was most probably offed elsewhere.
any idea how to, uh, remove the body from the sediment?
well, I mean, if we remove the moisture from the clay, then it should just fall away without effecting the bones at all.
I just need four dehumidifiers.
you okay there, Dr. Saroyan?
Yeah, I'm just itchy all over.
I'm gonna go burn all of these clothes and maybe my hair.
some male spiders are known to actually...
to pluck their webs, like a guitar, to attract the females.
someone should tell them, it's drummers that get the girls.
we were in Bangalore visiting the Karnataka Belur temple when a pickpocket stole my wallet.
Jared climbed onto the roof of the building and tackled the thief.
you know, all that hero stuff?
I learned it from my big brother.
that along with hotwiring cars and stealing cable.
Jared's very proud of you.
Yeah. What can I say?
you know, it's normal big brother stuff, that's all.
I'm amazed at how good your English is. It's perfect.
that happens when you grow up in Alexandria, Virginia.
I'm third generation American.
Yes, you are.
thank you for setting me up and making me look like an idiot.
Yeah, it's just normal little brother stuff.
so, basically, you went all the way to India to meet a girl who lives down the street from you?
Seeley thinks every decision I make is wrong.
like you said, typical big brother.
Yeah.
so, what is it that you do for a living, Padme?
she's a bank robber.
it's a normal question, you know?
she's very glamorous. I thought maybe she worked at some glamorous job.
hardly.
I teach grade school.
Seeley's got a kid in third grade.
his name's Parker.
there's no one named Parker at my school.
she's the kid's favorite teacher, Seeley.
phosphate and calcium have leaked from the bones into the clay in several places, making the bones softer and the clay harder.
I see you started with dentition.
interesting juxtaposition.
substandard dental work, but top-of-the-line materials.
I thought that might help with identification.
I've seen that before in people who get their treatment for free at a dental school.
suggesting that the victim was poor.
specious leap, Mr. Nigel-Murray.
tendonitis in his elbow.
the hook of the hamate shows wear from torque, rotational force and repeated tugging.
inappropriate comments off the phrase "repeated tugging.
these are occupational markers for many professions, including funeral director surgeons, dentists, mechanics.
a dentist would most likely have his dental work done by other students, while in dental school.
that would explain the work on his teeth.
what might have caused the initial damage to the sternum.
E-Even though it's been severely degraded by demineralization?
Yes.
okay. I'll have to remove the rest of the clay first.
Oh, I will get you to praise me, Dr. Brennan.
I will have you look at me with admiration and astonishment at my...
I'm sorry, Mr. Nigel-Murray.
were you speaking to me?
no, Dr. Brennan.
I was simply... I was running through my, uh, knowledges
you think your brother's girlfriend is hinky?
is that slang for pretty or buxom?
no, it's just slang for iffy.
well, iffy is already slang.
I don't see the need for slang for slang.
the point is, there was just a-a hinky vibe between me and her.
look, you know what? I don't expect you to understand, Bones, though.
the victim's dental records confirm his identity.
dentist.
lives alone.
are they happy together?
what? - Jared and Padme.
do they seem happy? You've put a high premium on feelings.
don't go twisting this around, Bones.
I still do, okay, but this is right?
if he's sober, he should be able to find love.
I don't understand the rules.
Ah, there are no rules.
there's just life, okay?
there's just life.
do some serious remodeling, huh?
hands up.
no, no, no.
that what it looks like.
I'm allowed to be here.
who are you?
my-my Social Security number is three-zero-eight, one-two...
okay, Mr. Pickford, what are you doing here?
I'm Danny's contractor.
he said I could come in any time and use his TV.
Oh, that's right. He's been dead.
just... met someone.
Danny once took off for three weeks and never said a word.
Ah, big-screen TV, cold beer-- it's not a great motive for murder, but I've seen people killed for less.
he owes me money-- but I've seen people killed like, three grand.
you shouldn't be hassling me.
you should talk to his ex.
they had a bad breakup.
right. What's her name?
Chris. But she's a him.
I mean, it's a... Christopher Chris, not a Christine Chris.
he rents a place on Dahlgren Road.
there's no faster way to clean the skeleton?
Dr. Brennan seemed very anxious to get at the sternum.
uh, Dr. Saroyan, compliment or praise one of us interns?
if you want praise, I'd concentrate on the sternum if I'm there.
let's see if we can't figure out that was and, uh, whether it killed him.
put Dan through dental school.
is practice was up and running, he dumped me.
and since Virginia doesn't recognize gay marriage or civil unions, you weren't entitled to anything or civil unions, - It's not.
I'm sorry to inform you that we have identified some human remains as Daniel Pinard.
wait.
uh, Dan is dead?
when was the last time you saw him?
I haven't heard from him, but... got to be a year.
all right. Were you, uh...
were you upset when he broke off with you?
what?
well, like you said, you do not have legal options.
not upset enough to kill.
OK, I met someone after months and bygones are bygones, right?
and like I said, I've moved on.
because Danny was part of my past, questions, if you don't mind.
I do mind.
go got there?
looks like an arrowhead.
is that yours?
I'm a bow hunter-- whitetail deer.
Yeah. I'm gay and I hunt. Get over it.
that bow in his truck would generate sufficient velocity the victim's sternum.
what is she saying?
Basically，Either you coming with us willingly or I arrest you.
the damage to the sternum is not the cause of death.
so, the ex-boyfriend's off the hook?
at a velocity of 82 meters per second, a hunting arrow would not only pierce the sternum and the heart, but would sever the spinal column.
however, with at the angry ex-boyfriend might still or he-he made an amazing shot from the-the absolute the limit much like Dr. Brennan then, did I not?
up until the "very far," yes.
what stroke our victim in the chest?
it have been postmortem.
probably as a result of being tipped into a creek.
so, we don't have cause of death.
rhubarb.
uh, rhubarb?
uh, the victim was killed by rhubarb?
approximately ten kilos. - All right.
I'm usually pretty good with following your jumping brain but you've totally pretty good Rhubarb it is.
okay, well, you know, our victim wasn't killed by an arrow.
but hey, you know, the good news
our victim's dental hygienist says that he gave her hepatitis C.
the dental hygienist is gay, too?
I don't know. I'm going to ask her.
her?
did the victim have heterosexual relations with his hygienist?
miss Bryson, I'm Agent Booth.
they said Dan is dead.
what happened?
well, we were hoping that maybe yo
me?
how did you work this up without me?
when I told Dr. Saroyan that the sternum wound was not caused by a hunting arrow, my brain jumped to different types of arrows, which led me to the image of a giant wasp, which was silly, but which then led me to stinging nettles, which are covered in thousands of tiny little arrows, and on the tip of each tiny little arrow is a drop of oxalic acid, which not only stings, but works very well at dissolving silicates.
silicate causes clay to adhere...
and rhubarb is full of oxalic acid.
okay.
next time someone says your brain is a jumble of disconnected chaos, you just send them to me.
uh, people say that?
you need me to stir?
don't you have lots of spiders to trace?
well, there's over 30 separate breeding grounds within a 200-mile radius of the body site.
I'm analyzing the egg sacks to see if I can narrow it down further.
I've got some time.
and this is so cool.
you want to know if I had sex with Dan?
well, you filed a grievance against him requesting the ADA revoke his license because he gave you hepatitis C.
no, we didn't have sex.
Dan nicked me during a procedure.
Really?
so, he nicked himself and you?
what about the patient?
it was while preparing a syringe.
my husband and I tested positive after that.
who believed that story?
did your husband believe that story?
it ha... it happened.
how did you really get hepatitis C?
tell you what, before you answer that question, this here's a report from the ADA saying that Dan never had hepatitis C.
I had an affair.
I... I got hepatitis C.
I just... I needed a way to explain it to my husband.
right, so maybe you killed Dan so your husband wouldn't find out the truth, or your husband did.
no. No, neither of those things happened.
on the day that Dan Pinard disappeared, he canceled all of his appointments so he could, uh, go see Dr. Hibbert.
only problem is, we can't find this Dr. Hibbert.
Dr. Hibbert is the name that Dan wrote in his appointment book when he canceled patients at the last minute.
any idea who it might have been that day?
I was already fired.
right.
you ran a background check on Jared's girlfriend?
well, yeah. You do things like that for people you care about.
do you do that when I go out with someone?
look, Bones, you're the one who says not to jump to conclusions without all the facts.
but you always say, in matters of the heart...
Ah, the heart is just a muscle.
see?
I'm learning from you, huh?
anyways, this whole background check came up hinky.
hinky how?
four years ago, this woman was an escort.
Jared's going to be crushed.
Why?
I'm sure she possesses sophisticated sexual skills, and if she's reformed...
she's just... reformed? She's a reformed escort.
well, maybe Jared already knows.
no, he doesn't know.
how do you know he doesn't know?
because, if he knew, he wouldn't be talking about getting married.
he wouldn't be saying stuff like that.
look what Vincent did.
he turned our victim into rhubarb pie.
fractures are evident on at least half a dozen bones, including possible cause of death.
fracture to the glabellar region on the frontal bone.
head trauma could definitely be cause of death.
tendonitis of the shoulder, broken ribs, knee trauma and a nick to the ankle.
that's all just the right side.
sounds like he was tortured.
he also had Bennett's fracture of the thumb, broken left clavicle, and his knee... You know what?
these are all common football injuries.
some of the injuries are over a decade old, but others show almost no remodeling, which means...
he was still active in the sport.
a gay dentist who plays football.
do the significant looks you are exchanging mean that you doubt a gay man can play football and be a dentist?
no.
I mean, for me, the answer is no.
what I'm thinking is that American football is a bastion of testosterone - fueled masculinity.
maybe one too many lingering glances
well, does that happen often?
Yeah.
I mean, with me, it happened all the time.
who looked at me lustily, I wouldn't have made it out of school.
there's only one amateur full-contact league in the DC area, so it wasn't hard to find out which team Dan played for.
well, they are not unlike mountain rams that butt heads in an attempt to attract a mate.
it's hard to believe that brain damage isn't a result.
it's amazing. You can even make football sound bad, Bones.
come on, ladies.
my little sister hits harder than that.
Fillmore, do you want me to get you a skirt?
he's challenging their masculinity to enhance aggression.
that's coach talk. It's the way coaches talk. Let me handle this.
excuse me. Coach, FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.
this here is my partner, Dr. Temperance Brennan.
like to ask you a few questions about Dan Pinard.
Yeah, well, he better be in prison.
that's the only excuse I'll accept for how long he's been gone.
we found his body.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry. Did any of Dan's teammates or opponents have any problems with him?
what, he was murdered?
no.
uh, all the guys loved Dan.
is it possible that someone's masculinity was threatened and that person killed Dan because he was a homosexual?
way to ease into that one, Bones. That's smooth.
no, that's definitely not an issue with my guys.
what makes your team so highly evolved, Coach?
meet the Cardinals, Agent Booth.
we're all gay.
good hit!
so, anybody here have any problems with Dan?
disagreements, arguments, fights?
everyone here joined this team because a lot of the straight players don't want us on their teams.
we're like family.
no one here hurt Dan.
no way.
and you're all gay?
Oh, I suppose, statistically, we could have two or three straights who are still in the closet.
booth, this is Dan's equipment bag.
I found his protective headgear inside.
that's a helmet, Bones.
there's blood on the inside of the lip.
it approximates the location of the fracture on Dan's forehead.
the force could have cracked his skull and killed him.
are you sure nothing happened here?
one of your guys, they probably could have hit Dan-- you know, in practice a little too hard, try to cover it up.
what are you saying?
I mean, you lose your insurance, you're kicked out of the league.
but hey, it was just an accident, right?
all right, I'll tell you what. Anybody who's got plans for this weekend, just cancel 'em.
because of blood on a football helmet?
because of blood inside of a football helmet.
isn't that right, Bones? - That's correct.
I was draining the vat when I noticed these white things floating in the rhubarb stew.
spider eggs, right?
no.
no, the boiling water would have destroyed the eggs.
so what are they?
I have no idea.
always glad to sow confusion.
this man endured a remarkable amount of abuse.
it must have been tough.
Yeah, this ain't England, pal.
being gay in America is still a tough go.
I was referring to being a football player.
Yeah, I-I knew that.
four years ago Jared's girlfriend was a hooker?
an escort.
I believe, in the hierarchy of prostitution, an escort ranks equal to "high-class call girl.
and now she teaches grade school?
I don't see any other injuries to the bone that could be cause of death.
that leads us back to the head trauma.
apparently the rule is: once a sex worker, always a sex worker.
you know, it really would have been better if Booth never ran her record.
he said it was my influence, that it was the rational thing to do.
no, sweetie, he's rationalizing, which makes what he did irrational because he's rationalizing that Jared cannot make rational decisions for himself
you do the same thing all the time.
maybe that's what he learned from you.
in order to be fatal, whatever struck the frontal bone had to be pointed enough to pierce the brain.
now, wait a second.
is Booth going to tell Jared about this?
I believe that's his plan.
what if Jared and this woman are really in love?
booth could ruin everything.
well, not if, as Booth always asserts, love conquers all.
Yeah, well, this is going to be one hell of a test case.
I ran blood tests on the items in Dan's athletic bag.
I found evidence of someone else's blood.
football is a contact sport.
there are bound to be traces of other people's DNA on his uniform.
this was more than a trace, and it wasn't on his uniform.
it was all over his towel.
we ran it through CODIS and got a match.
32-year-old man named Sid Ziegler.
Ziegler is a firefighter and a former marine.
he lives in Greenbelt, Maryland.
he plays for one of the, the other teams in Dan's league.
one of the straight teams?
Yeah, was a big game.
Ziegler fumbles, the victim recovers, scores a touchdown, game over.
well, I doubt even a homophobe would kill for that.
Yeah, but a fight ensues.
Oh, so they fought?
if Dan won a physical altercation in front of both teams, then there-there's a certain personality type that might feel impugned enough to strike back.
go on.
gay guy beats up a certain type of straight guy, straight guy can't handle it.
well, see, that's what I wanted to know.
now, did the victim and Ziegler have any contact since their fistfight?
well, the two of 'em
they played against each other in a game the weekend before Dan disappeared.
okay. - Jared.
Hey, Seeley, your message sounded urgent.
what's going on?
thanks for the gay insights.
you're welcome.
okay.
you got that big brother look all over your face, like the time you had to tell me the puppy I brought home was a rat.
uh, well, um, that sort of happened again.
okay, what the hell are you talking about?
there are some things that you need to know about Padme.
you ran a background check on my girlfriend?
no, she was arrested for prostitution four years ago.
shut up, Seeley, shut up.
the charges-- they didn't stick, but you need to know that she was an escort.
you just can't stand to see me happy, can you?
no, that's not true. If I were in your shoes,
I'd want to know if my girlfriend was hiding something.
no, you wouldn't.
okay, I have watched you for years.
I learned.
you would make your own judgment.
you wouldn't care what other people said.
you'd say exactly what I'm gonna say.
go to hell.
look, I called him a fag, the dude kicked my ass, end of story.
you got a problem with gays?
no, that was over a year ago.
look, what's this all about?
I'm trying to put together a sequence of events before Dan Pinard disappeared.
disappeared?
W-what do you mean "disappeared"?
we, uh, found your blood on his towel.
I-I cut myself during a game-- big gash on my leg.
Danny used his towel to stop the bleeding.
what do you mean "disappeared"?
he came up to you in the locker room and he presses that towel on your leg?
I thought... I thought it was only me.
I thought Danny didn't want to see me anymore.
I-I called him, I went by his place a hundred times.
nothing.
why do you think he didn't want to see you again?
because, I mean, Danny had it all figured-- who he was.
I wasn't ready.
to come out of the closet.
for any of it.
that made Danny mad sometimes, you know, frustrated.
is Danny dead?
you, uh, you think I killed him.
Danny was, uh-- The only time I've ever been happy was with Danny.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
I don't guess anyone would understand.
looks like cause of death to me.
cause of death, yes, yes, but I cannot discern the cause of the cause of death, so to speak.
okay, bugs and slime, pal.
different discipline entirely, sorry.
there appear to be three separate fractures on the skull.
w-we couldn't see them before because all of the fracture lines connect.
okay, so the victim was hit three times instead of once.
Dr. Brennan thinks that the brain was pierced when the skull was hit.
brain piercing, yeah, sounds very death-causing to me.
the beveling on the exterior of the skull suggests that all three fracture points emanate from inside the skull.
his forehead exploded from the inside out.
again, very deathy.
wait a minute.
what would cause someone's forehead to explode from the inside?
I was hoping that you'd say it had something to do with those bulbous seedy jobbers that I thought were spider eggs.
no, I mean
Oh, wow.
wow?
what wow?
so Ziegler was a marine.
he gets married to a woman, it lasts six years. Why?
why did his marriage last six years?
no, why did he get married?
well, most likely Ziegler was trying to conform to social norms.
in many cultures, homosexuality is revered.
anthropologically, it makes no sense for heterosexuals to be threatened by homosexuals because they are actually removing themselves from competition for mates.
right, so Ziegler forces himself to conform, and the dentist comes along and forces, you know, Ziegler to confront...
Ziegler couldn't come to terms with his sexual orientation, so when the victim elicited this flood of unwanted feelings in him, he transferred the self-loathing from himself to the victim.
native Americans believed that homosexuals were of two spirits, held them in high esteem.
so what's the problem?
it's no problem. Why are you looking at me like that?
I was a soldier. I mean, gay guys
they saved my life in battle more than once.
so are you saying that if a former prostitute saved your life in battle, that would solve the problem with Jared's girlfriend?
what?
seriously, you're going to bring that up in front of Sweets right now?
it's a rational question.
I'm sorry, Jared's involved with a prostitute?
former, former prostitute.
bones. - What?
Oh, did you run a background check on Jared's girlfriend?
okay, why is everybody saying that to me like it's some sort of terrible thing?
cause it's kind of terrible.
look, I'm just looking out for my brother, that's all, so can we just, you know, focus on the case?
Yeah, uh, well, the fact that the suspect carries in his wallet a photo of them together
it doesn't really jibe with homosexual panic.
great, thanks, that's all I need to know.
I got enough.
Thanks, appreciate it, Sweets.
wow, that was... - I have to go, too.
thank you, Dr. Sweets, for your invaluable psychological insights into the human condition.
do you know what Vincent Nigel-Murray is?
he's a genius.
Yes, but so are we all, except for Angela.
Oh, right, and yet, who do you turn to when you need pretty pictures?
Dr. Hodgins figured out what caused the fracture to the frontal bone.
Vincent found these small particulates floating in the rhubarb stew, right?
well, I identified them as silica phytolith, which is a, a razor - thin, clear hard shell which protects seeds.
now, the victim was tossed into the creek bed where his body quickly decomposed.
flooding from the rain washed the clay and debris into that creek bed, which encased the body.
now, in all that muck, three periwinkle seeds became embedded within the victim's skull.
okay.
it's called floral perturbation.
over time, soft can become even harder than hard, like a sliver of grass that grows through cement.
the same kind of process that causes tree roots to destroy pipes.
so a seedling fractured the frontal bone?
three of them.
so head trauma was not cause of death.
we have no cause of death.
did she seem disappointed to anyone else?
she definitely seemed disappointed to me.
the pollen from the egg sack is from hickory pine trees.
but they don't grow where the body was found.
she didn't even want me to help her examine the bones.
okay, you're not listening to me.
Yes, the, um--the keening shriek of intern anxiety is interfering with my hearing.
there is a slice on the medial malleolus.
Yes, uh, duly noted in my report.
but you didn't note what that might mean.
I would, uh, most definitely have done so, if-if I had the slightest inkling of what it might mean.
whatever caused the nick on this bone must have cut the posterior tibial artery.
Oh, yes.
tissue.
um, posterior tibial artery... massive bleeding.
dude, you should totally just toss culpability onto Cam.
I need to know if the weapon that caused this left any trace in the bone.
well, Vincent's rhubarb stew completely washed away all the surface particulates.
see how that's done?
we can sand down the top layer of bones cells and analyze what lies beneath.
thank you.
my bad.
you can't blame Mr. Nigel-Murray.
the nick was on the bone, but I should've realized the implications for the flesh.
and I didn't.
I agree.
then why are you letting him worry that he's disappointing you?
Mr. Nigel-Murray should be aware by now that I don't hold others to my level of expertise.
otherwise I'd have no one to help me.
how would he know that if you don't tell him?
tungsten carbide, which is a compound used to coat various types of tools.
including dental tools.
I distinctly remember saying to you once, "Good job, Mr. Nigel-Murray.
I'm saying it again now.
Cheers.
brilliant, that.
one of the suspects was Dan's dental hygienist...
Hey, where does she live?
Fairfax, Virginia.
okay, the pollen I found in the sheet weaver spider's egg sack came from hickory pine trees.
they don't grow where the body was found, but you can find them all over that part of Virginia.
motive, theoretical weapon, spiders.
that should be enough for an arrest.
so, according to Grace Bryson's statement, she and her husband were at a yoga retreat when Dan Pinard disappeared.
well, the retreat was in Silver Spring.
that's close enough to drive back, kill Dan and then return to the spa.
right. It could be both her and her husband.
when your gut speaks to you, do you think it could be an increase in stomach acid, due to anxiety?
huh?
I feel some anxiety.
okay, about what?
about your sudden abandonment of a belief system.
really, it's-it's making my stomach upset.
okay, you know what? You are really just, um
crack a window there, Bones.
all right, just get some air.
you told me that my father's criminal past didn't matter.
that the love between us was real and that was all that mattered.
because I believed you, my father and I have a relationship today.
okay.
I'm glad I could help out.
but I'm anxious because I can't see any meaningful difference between my father and your brother's girlfriend.
can you explain that to me?
it's a question of logic, so I'm just going to be quiet now while you work your way through it.
I already told you where I was, at the yoga retreat.
Yeah, we know that.
but you would have had more than enough time to, uh, leave the retreat and return.
well, I didn't.
so, can you leave me alone?
after Dan fired you, you couldn't find a job, could you?
well, that wasn't Dan's fault.
that was the hepatitis.
ms. Bryson, do you own a set of dental tools?
well, I had to buy a set when I was in school. Why?
can we see 'em?
no.
not without a warrant.
when did you put in this driveway?
excuse me?
when were these paving stones laid?
a few months ago.
is there something illegal now about doing home improvements?
what's going on, Bones?
look at the stones.
well, you know these stones look just like the ones that were at Dan's house.
it's the same contractor.
I met him at Dan's office, before I was fired.
well, he said he had some extra materials left over from Dan's job and he could give me a deal.
that's a scam. Lucas was reselling the supplies I don't know that.
when you were at the yoga retreat?
Yeah.
he was finished by the time we got back.
was the fastest he ever finished anything.
we need to dig these up.
backhoe and a cement cutter.
the bottom of the paving stones are covered in blood.
all the samples I've taken are a match for the victim.
he bled out on the ground.
then it was paved over.
coated in tungsten carbide.
please tell me it's a match.
it is, in fact, a perfect match for the injury to the victim's ankle.
Yeah. Cheers. Brilliant.
no, she didn't say anything.
I-I discerned a lovely-- a little glint of approbation in her eye.
I-I admit it.
we had an argument.
about the paving stones?
Yeah.
did you call him something?
a vulgar slur for "homosexual?
in the heat of the moment, maybe.
I mean, but you should've heard what he was calling me!
Dan knocked me down and he started kicking me.
so I grabbed the-the scraper, and swung it at him to get him off me.
self-defense.
Yeah, that's it.
I-- I'll admit it.
it was self-defense.
Yeah, except, um, you didn't call 911.
no.
you just watched him bleed to death, and then you dumped his body in a ditch.
if he charged me with theft, I lose my contractor's license.
my whole livelihood.
for what?
a few dozen paving stones?
the guy attacked me for a few dozen paving stones.
you robbed him.
you lied about it, and you called him a "fag.
to him, that was a big deal.
I'm sure Jared wants to talk to you alone, Booth.
no, he asked for you to be here.
I really don't want to be in the middle of a fight.
I'm not going to fight.
there's going to be no fighting. I promise, all right?
so, you really think I was wrong?
I don't know if you were wrong.
but I fail to see the point of being right.
okay.
I've really been thinking about what you said.
what if I ruined it for him?
what if he was really happy with her?
I imagine you would never forgive yourself.
Thanks.
well, on the bright side, he might totally ignore you.
great. Thank you.
well, perhaps Jared will think for himself.
isn't that all you've ever really wanted for him?
Hey, sorry we're late.
padme, this is Temperance Brennan.
this is my brother's partner, slash friend.
nice to meet you.
pleasure.
so... here we are.
think we can talk outside, privately?
no.
whatever you want to say, you can say to both of us.
see, we don't have secrets, Seeley.
never did.
about anything.
I suspect Jared is implying that he already knew about Padme's past as an escort.
great, thanks, Bones. I got that.
Jared and I have come to grips with... everything.
Yeah.
so, the question is: Are you in or are you out?
I'm in.
good. That's good,'cause, uh, I really wanted to know if you'd be my best man.
Wow.
uh... so soon.
it's only been, what, a month?
what?
temperance, she kicked me under the table.
pretty sure she was aiming for you.
definitely meant for me.
well, if that's true, I like her.
I'd like to make a toast.
what is this?
it's her new thing. She likes to make-- She's really good at making toasts, though.
maybe we should get some champagne, though.
no, Jared is an alcoholic.
no secrets.
when Booth and I first met, I didn't believe that such a thing as love existed.
I maintained that it was simply brain chemistry.
but perhaps Booth is correct.
perhaps love comes first and then creates the reaction.
I have no tangible proof, but... I'm willing to accept Booth's premise.
to love.
to love.
to love.
to love.
they put me in charge of all of this.
I'm like one of those big shots on Wall Street, only I deal with laundry instead of money.
not many people know it, but this is the nerve center of the entire hotel.
well, I would have thought it would be room service.
no way. Proper washing at this volume depends on water quality, bleach concentration, time, and of course, agitation and heat.
agitation and heat.
Yeah, I definitely got that.
we're going to be late for dinner.
I pushed our reservations.
check this baby out.
energy Plus.
that means not only am I washing away the filth and the fluids that people get on your hotel sheets,
I'm also on the front line of the fight against global warming.
what was that?
foreign object in the wash barrel. It happens.
it looks gooey. Won't it gum up your machine?
whatever it is, this baby can handle it.
okay, so the only way the body could have gotten down here is if someone threw it down the laundry chute.
well, that would seem to suggest homicide.
Yes, it would.
is that a new tie?
Yeah, yeah, yes, it is. You like it?
well, I'm not sure why you'd want to wear frolicking cetaceans around your neck.
well, because Catherine got it for me. Look, look, they're little dolphins.
the marine biologist?
Yeah. Yeah, it was a present.
interesting.
what do you mean, "interesting"?
check this out.
good luck on the I. D.
too bad they didn't do him on the delicate cycle, huh?
obviously, the manufacturers didn't anticipate human remains.
you know, according to the laundry guy, the body could have been sitting in the pile of dirty sheets for two days before it got thrown into the wash.
well, the heat in here would have sped up decomp.
look out. I'm going in.
judging by the concavity of the rib end, the victim was middle-aged.
dismemberment occurred postmortem, most likely during the spin cycle.
Hey, what's so interesting about my tie?
a gift is a social contract, a basic anthropological construct.
by giving you the tie, Catherine has entered into a social contract with you.
Really?
fabric softener has permeated the soft tissue, everything's swollen.
speaking of social contracts, do you like your gynecologist?
she's extremely competent, yes, but I don't think she's accepting new patients.
I thought you were happy with Dr. Oksenberg?
all right, listen, can you two just save the lady part discussion for when I'm not here?
Dr. Oksenberg moved to California, and I am looking for a doctor for Michelle.
she's at that age, you know...
Oh, no, no, no.
we are not gonna be discussing your daughter's sex life because,
a: she's a good girl- she doesn't have sex; and, B: you're touching a dead body.
I don't follow your logic.
I'm always touching a dead body, Seeley.
if I let that be a barrier to conversation, I would nev...
okay, can someone just please remove the eyeball.
this is not an eyeball.
what is it?
I'll put it this way: our victim was male.
would you rather us go back to talking about lady parts?
the skeleton appears to have suffered a great deal of damage in the washer.
Oh, that wins the understatement award for today.
it's going to be very difficult to find cause of death.
well, if the three pounds of muck I've got here in the catch is any indication, then that washing machine must have been a beast.
Dr. Brennan, I found something.
right here, at the junction of the maxilla and palatine.
what is that, a bullet wound? He was shot?
VAZIRI: The hole is a result of surgery, not a gunshot.
most likely for oral cancer.
there's also bone degeneration on the mandible.
our victim was probably a cigar smoker.
anything else? - Condom.
unused. Never mind.
I also found a number of fully remodeled fractures.
here's one on the right hamate bone.
it's approximately three years old.
an injury like this is most typical for professional baseball players.
the great Tony Pena suffered a similar fracture.
Oh-for-11 as a utility infielder before being traded by the Royals...
to the White Sox after successful surgery to repair his hamate.
Oh, and our All-American Muslim drives in a run.
nice one, Arastoo. - Thank you.
I thought our victim played baseball, but then I saw these.
a number of mostly repaired compression fractures in the tibia and tarsus.
an injury pattern most commonly sustained by rock climbers.
and these fractures occurred about a year after the hamate fracture.
and here's where I go for the triple because...
another remodeled fracture, about a year old, and to the hyoid.
with an accompanying microfracture on the parietal.
almost certainly indicating our victim was involved in a high-speed collision while wearing a helmet.
what does this mean?
Rock- climbing, baseball- playing, crash test dummy?
is there a testicle up here?
four that I know of.
brennan: I thought you located them at the scene.
just the one that scared Booth.
I've cataloged the loose tissue, and all the victim's organs and glands are accounted for, but the other testicle seems to have vanished.
brennan: Well, it's not here.
but it does appear our victim was in the habit of injuring himself annually in a variety of risky behaviors.
so the guy with one gonad actually had balls.
well, if you'll excuse me, I've got an appointment.
BOOTH: So you're telling me I should be looking for a cigar-smoking, thrill seeker missing one of the family jewels?
that's correct.
you know, stereotypical male behavior such as cigar smoking and risk-taking could be a form of overcompensation in a man who was born with only one testicle.
I could write up a profile.
there's no reason to assume the victim was born without one.
he could just as easily have lost it in one of his dangerous pursuits.
if a testicle is severely twisted or de-gloved, it almost always necessitates removal.
I- In the case of penetrating trauma...
no. No. No. Uh, let's...No.
do you think we can go 20 minutes on this case without talking about testicles?
please. - Great.
booth has made a social contract with the marine biologist.
sorry?
it's amazing you go from injured testicles to the woman I'm dating.
and you, you're supposed to say "Oh, that's interesting" in a very annoying way.
it was a logical transition.
but it is very interesting.
booth and I are friends. Catherine is an intelligent, attractive woman, and I'm intrigued by their developing relationship.
Yeah, that's nice. I think.
Yeah, I think it is nice.
thank you, Bones.
you two seem to be handling dating very well.
I'm impressed.
well, you've known me for two years, Sweets.
you should expect to be impressed by me.
you were board-certified in '99?
that is correct.
and you did a fellowship at Vanderbilt in...
reproductive endocrinology.
boy, you really did your research.
you were recommended by Dr. Oksenberg, but I wanted to make sure this is the right fit.
Oh, yeah, no, of course.
do you consider yourself easy to talk to?
especially about delicate topics, like...
someone's first time having sex.
um, their first time with a new partner?
no, no, their first time.
losing their virginity.
well, uh, yes, of course.
I- I'd be, uh, very sensitive with that topic.
trauma? My God.
uh, why would you bring up trauma?
well, when an adult woman, such as yourself, forgoes sexual activity, there are often deeper issues at play.
what?
there's been a misunderstanding here.
I'm looking for a gynecologist for my daughter, who's 16.
great.
I mean, yeah, that just makes more sense.
I deal with a lot of teenagers.
and, uh, they feel very comfortable with me because they know they're free to speak about anything, and it will remain confidential.
excellent.
well, obviously, you're respectful and highly qualified.
I think this will work.
I'm glad.
thank you.
actually, I, um, don't have a husband.
Michelle is my adoptive daughter.
I see.
so thank you, Dr. Lidner.
uh, Paul, please. You could just call me Paul.
you have something for me?
Yep, fingernails.
I don't think they're gonna help with the I. D.
I also have clothing remnants, mostly denim, a chain, also most likely part of the victim's apparel,
some pieces of a molded silicone elastomer.
the missing testicle.
Oh, God. - It's a prosthetic one.
they're made of a silicone shell and filled with saline.
now, obviously this has suffered a lot of damage in the wash, but if we can get a serial number off this, we can get an I. D.
okay, I photographed each piece of the silicone elastomer, and I used the photos to reassemble a virtual prosthetic.
well, the serial numbers were pretty worn from the washing machine.
Yeah.
you know, I have to say that this whole finding I. D. by testicle definitely beats facial reconstructions.
does that prosthetic seem overly large to you?
well, it isn't to scale, Cam.
guess it's...been a while.
MONTENEGRO: Okay, uh, I got the serial number for you.
I'll get it to Booth.
it's pretty big.
BOOTH: Richard Cole. 42, single, commercial real estate developer.
left his entire fortune to the American Cancer Society.
so that rules out, uh, financial motive.
researchers can be ruthless.
Yeah, well, look at this.
this article he did last spring in Cigar Connoisseur.
he had oral cancer. He shouldn't have smoked.
that is not his biggest problem right now.
he talks about going to fantasy camps every year for his birthday.
fantasy camps?
they're expensive camps where grown-ups, they get to pretend to be, uh, you know, race car drivers, uh, professional ballplayers- pretty much anything.
that would explain the yearly injuries.
you could easily crush a testicle at rodeo camp.
look what's going on this week at the hotel.
God, I wish I had enough money for this one.
why, what is it?
did you ever dream about jamming with your favorite musical heroes or playing gigs in front of throngs of screaming fans?
well, please join us at the one and only fantasy camp created by the legendary music manager and promoter: me, Simon Graham!
music camp? - That's not music.
that's rock and roll, baby. Yeah.
according to Cole's lawyer, he was trying to buy a property that Simon Graham didn't want him to have.
you think Graham murdered Cole to safeguard some property?
it's possible. But don't say that Cole is dead.
I don't want anybody panicking or trying to flee the scene.
I was a very big fan of Toad the Wet Sprocket.
you might want to keep that to yourself, all right?
now don't get overwhelmed. It's gonna be very loud in here and...
man: So, are you going to the seminar on string height?
I have a class on tone control then.
Oh, that's great.
BOOTH: They're all in line...
they're not even pushing.
this is not my rock and roll fantasy.
no, no, this can't be right. Rock and roll's not about seminars.
come on, people. "Does anybody remember laughter?"
Hey, I remember. Zeppelin, man.
dude, you can lose the tie around here.
he- he likes it. It's a gift from a woman.
right. FBI Special Agent Sealy Booth.
hacker get you anything?
a subscription to Lapham's Quarterly. - Sexy.
can I help you guys with something?
you know, 'cause I really don't want to be late for class.
I paid a fortune to be at this camp.
Yeah, we're looking for Simon Graham.
I think he's near the stage. Walk this way.
aerosmith.
Hey, you know your music. This is Bebe. I'm Gino.
is something wrong?
it's about one of your camp mates- Richard Cole.
he hasn't been around for a couple of days.
he probably got tired of fighting with Simon.
Really?
GRAHAM: Boys and girls, Erik Dalton!
Simon's in there. Erik Dalton is starting his workshop.
what? Erik Dalton is here?
bones, this is more like it.
booth? - Just give me a minute, huh?
shouldn't we try to talk to Simon?
woman: I love you, Erik!
who unplugged me? No one unplugs me!
he's right. No one unplugs Erik Dalton.
well, apparently I do.
it was the only way to get your attention.
get her out of here, Simon!
you're yelling unnecessarily, probably due to hearing loss from the music you play.
what do you think you're doing?
okay, listen. Simon Graham. FBI.
we just have to ask you a few questions about Richard Cole.
what the hell is this? I'm running a business here!
I understand. It's not gonna take long.
dude, I'm really sorry.
VAZIRI: I've identified 83 injuries to the skeleton that occurred either at the time of death or in the washing machine.
I can't tell which.
so no cause of death?
not without evidence from hemorrhagic staining, and these remains went through a wash cycle with industrial- strength bleach.
I was pitching a no-hitter, and now I can't find the plate.
this baseball thing.
were you allowed to play?
no. The Quran strictly forbids baseball, lacrosse, of course, and board games with hungry hippos.
that's a yes, with an additional comment on my ignorance.
I was a State All-Star in high school.
I even got scouted by a couple of farm teams.
no way.
Yeah, I still play on the weekends.
my mosque is in a league. We play against churches and synagogues.
you should join us sometime.
Oh, come on now. I can't be on an all-Muslim team.
I m a lapsed Episcopalian.
every team has a few ringers. The Jews have a Unitarian batting . 400.
Really?
never tried to beat the infidels before.
as long as you find something in your washer goop that helps me determine cause of death, you can play shortstop.
you're on.
Hey, is it, uh, is it true that Simon Graham's here?
Yeah, he's in the conference room.
okay, I can provide a valuable insight, Agent Booth.
this man practically invented a rock subculture.
you need me.
you just want to meet him.
there's a little of that, yes, but I'll be professional.
you know I'm a good profiler.
okay, professional.
Yes, sure.
do you know how many seminal rock concert tours he's managed?
Yeah, the guy's a god, but maybe a murdering god.
so use your ears, not your mouth. Just listen, you understand?
Yeah.
the camp is for people who love music, not wannabes in designer jeans and fancy guitars they never touch.
you're describing Richard Cole?
well, you know, he's the idiot that wanted me to turn him into Jimmy Page when the only guitar that he ever played came from a video game. I mean...
that would offend you.
that's a personal affront to someone who's dedicated their life to nurturing real musicians.
well, shouldn't it?
what can you tell me about The Stockyard?
Oh, it's a famous rock club in downtown Baltimore.
all the greats used to play there.
Mr. Graham used to run it in the '80s.
you weren't asking me. Sorry.
once Cole's deal went through, he was gonna tear it down, wasn't he?
sweets: That's why you and Cole were fighting, right?
Yeah, we settled that, though.
what are you talking about?
well, Cole said that he'd leave the club alone if I let him do one song with Erik Dalton at the end of camp night.
Erik Dalton's one of your guests?
Erik Dalton's one of your guest stars?
he blackmailed you.
so, did you agree to let Cole play with Dalton?
well, yeah. I mean, it's The Stockyard we're talking about.
how did Dalton feel about that?
how do you think he felt?
listen, guys, do you mind if I go back to work?
sure.
one- one quick question.
bar fight: who wins?
prince and the New Power Generation or Korn?
never mess with Prince.
never mess with Prince.
I...honestly, I think you'll like Dr. Lidner.
you should have someone else to talk to, especially if there's anything...anything you'd prefer I didn't know about.
I told you, Perry and I are not having sex.
I know, and I believe you, but you're growing up.
your body, it's a woman's body now, not a child's.
and you should treat it like a woman.
and I'm gonna stop talking now.
it's no big deal, Cam.
it's just a doctor.
I know, it just means you're growing up for real.
and you don't quite know how to handle that.
what? No.
Yeah, kind of, but I will. We will, right?
I mean, you don't know how to handle me either.
do you?'Cause that would be embarrassing.
we're fine, Cam.
because you and Perry aren't having sex, right? Okay, okay.
fry?
how's it going?
Dr. Brennan's waiting for cause of death.
at this rate, I'm gonna be John Gochnaur.
okay, boys, I'll bite.
who is John Gochnaur?
the worst major league baseball player ever.
Cleveland Indians.
187 batting average, zero home runs, and 146 errors.
well, is that bad?
Yeah, that's incomprehensibly bad.
here, this might help. I found it in the washing machine catch.
what is it?
well, it's bone, so it's your department.
crosshatching.
it may be bone, but it isn't human.
Hodgins: Well, then what is it?
it can't be.
what can't it be?
it's a piece of bone- tusk, actually- from a...
a woolly mammoth.
there was a prehistoric elephant in the washer with him?
what, are you nuts?
no, it has Schreger lines on the grain. It's a woolly mammoth.
but no help to me.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
see how this top edge curves?
now, if the curve continued, and then down here, before it got worn away in the washer, there was a point.
a guitar pick?
exactly.
why would someone want a guitar pick made of an extinct prehistoric mammal?
well, according to my dad, guitarists have this thing about their picks.
different materials make different sounds.
Bryan May- he uses an English penny.
my dad uses a Nicaraguan Cordoba.
some guys use tortoise shells or shark's tooth.
do you know of any famous guitarists who use woolly mammoth picks?
Mr. Dalton's pick ended up in the washing machine with the dead body.
that poses some serious questions, don't you think?
Yes, I do.
and Dalton isn't exactly known for keeping his cool.
check out this video from a concert in Australia two years ago.
Hodgins: This guy's got a seriously short fuse.
so, Richard Cole stops showing up for his private rehearsals with you, and you don't notice?
are you kidding me? I was thrilled. I was sick of kissing his ass.
Hey, what are you doing, baby? Can I help you with something?
you have no expertise that would be of value to me.
I wouldn't be so sure. Why don't you come sit next to me?
excuse me. I really like your music- doesn't mean I'm not gonna clock you, all right?
let's just focus.
so, Simon Graham, he pays you a boatload of money, and you still treat the campers like crap?
the guy's a poser, dude.
I got stuck with an asshat.
couldn't even play rhythm for Toad the Wet Sprocket.
Oh, I love them.
Mmm, suddenly the inside of my pants isn't such a happy place.
personally, I find your music discordant and irritating.
rather reminiscent of Murawari death wailing in its capacity to annoy.
so, maybe Cole pisses you off, throw in a little coke in the mix, and you lose control.
it's not like it hasn't happened before.
Hey, man, I've been clean for two years.
I even do yoga.
and that hurts.
booth? - Yeah?
the splintering is fresh.
something hit the side of this table quite hard, and there are scuff marks on the wall beside it that could indicate a struggle.
was there a fight in this room?
a party. I had some campers over Tuesday night.
gives 'em a story to tell their friends.
there's blood on the carpet.
I don't know anything about that.
when things got wild, I left.
caught a cab across town to spend some quality time with a girlfriend.
well, I'm gonna need that girlfriend's name and number.
and I'm gonna need this carpet.
sure.
Hey, how did it go?
fine.
you really didn't need to come with me.
I just wanted to make sure you were comfortable.
sure. He's cool. Easy to talk to.
good. That's excellent.
uh, excuse me, Dr. Saroyan.
um, do you have a minute?
a couple of insurance questions is all.
sure.
be back in a minute.
is there a problem with Michelle?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
She's- she's great. In perfect health.
and she spoke to you...
about things.
confidential things.
I can tell you she's a wonderful girl.
but that's not why I wanted to talk to you.
right. Insurance.
uh, not about insurance, either, no.
now I'm stumped.
um, I just thought...
would it be weird if I asked you to, uh, go out with me sometime?
Yes, that- that, um...would be weird.
of course. Uh, very weird.
Yeah, right? It- it is weird.
totally. Totally weird.
but, um, I would say yes.
Really?
That's...great.
does that mean you're asking?
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
work. I've got to go.
Oh, I- I am, though.
what? - Asking.
I'll call you?
I would like that.
so we know that the microfractures radiate out of each trauma site.
now, the trick is to separate out those points of trauma where the radiating microfractures just keep going because there were no earlier fractures to cross paths with.
VAZIRI: In this way, we can identify the perimortem fractures, and therefore, determine that cause of death was trauma to the skull and chest cavity.
Cole was beaten to death.
excellent work. - Thank you.
and Angela, of course. Double play, right?
Yeah.
I assume you were talking about baseball again, although I have no idea why.
well, it's baseball season, sweetie.
this is when boys like to hit balls with sticks when the snow melts.
I don't know why.
well, what about the murder weapon?
I'm going to make castings of the pertinent injuries.
I'm making him 3-D scans so he can focus on all the un-remodeled fractures.
sweets would probably say that the need to hit balls with a large stick shows that you're insecure with your manhood.
I can assure you...
I think it's probably just enjoyable to hit things.
Erik Dalton's hotel room's a good bet for the murder scene. We found two sets of DNA.
so, two people bled on this carpet?
Yes. The first set of DNA belonged to our victim.
perhaps the second set belongs to our killer.
I found traces of Klonopin in the mystery blood, which means, whoever it belongs to either has a panic disorder or epilepsy.
we should cross-reference the list of campers with the prescription drug database.
booth seems to like Catherine, don't you think?
I do. I'm glad. It's been a long time since he's dated anyone.
I know. It's important for Booth to share his life.
I prefer being alone.
but you're seeing Hacker.
Yes, and I like him, but not like Booth.
I mean, not like Booth wants to like someone.
all organisms evolve and develop along patterns only recognized in retrospect.
your life doesn't exist outside the laws of nature.
then in ignorance, I await my own surprise.
although the odds of it involving a commitment to another person are remote.
I never thought I'd be dating now; yet I am.
you met someone?
I think so.
we're going to have lunch.
it's been quite a while for you.
and thanks for pointing that out.
Oh, Booth wants me to meet him at the hotel.
go. I'll call you if I get a hit on the Klonopin.
all right, now reverse on the chords.
booth, I'm not sure this is a worthwhile use of our time.
Why? We're still waiting for an I. D. on the blood, right?
I mean, Come on. We've got a few minutes to spare.
this is pathetic, Booth, pretending to be something you're not.
it's dilettante camp.
okay, listen. What if this was, like, anthropology fantasy camp, and you got to meet- I don't know- Margaret Mead?
she's dead.
well, who would you want to meet?
me. - You?
Yes, if I were an anthropology enthusiast,
I'd want to go to fantasy camp to meet me.
Ah, come on, Bones. Play along.
it's rock and roll fantasy camp.
it's cool, right?
you hear that? That is our song. Remember? "Hot Blooded."
the last time we sang this song, Booth, someone tried to kill you.
Yeah, but it was fun up until the blast, right?
come on?
wait a second. You play the guitar?
well, I play the Akontig, the folk lute of the Jola tribe, but the guitar is not dissimilar.
cam got an I. D. the other blood found in the hotel room.
Fred Keaton. He's also registered here as a camper.
all right, look, one more verse.
I didn't do anything.
you took off from fantasy camp.
you disappear, and you end up hiding out in some cheap motel?
I wasn't hiding.
we know you and Richard Cole had a fight in Erik Dalton's hotel room.
your blood is on the carpet with his.
he had it coming, okay?
what was the fight about?
I told him I was still hoping to be discovered.
I know it's ridiculous, but I've spent years in my garage playing, and I'm good. It could happen, right?
just keep going.
last Monday, we had a jam night at camp.
this guy came up to me, told me he's with Rolling Stone.
told me my guitar playing is amazing; he's gonna include me in an article called "The 100 Best Guitarists You've Never Heard Of.
Oh, that sounds like a good thing.
sounds too good, I'm guessing.
then these girls come up, told me I'm going to be a star.
asked if they could keep me company for a few hours.
what- what for?
for sex, Bones.
quite a lucky night for you.
it was a prank. See, he was messing with you, wasn't he?
how was I supposed to know?
I called my wife, told her I wanted to take a break.
then at Erik Dalton's party, Cole starts laughing.
tells me the journalist was an actor.
and the groupies were... - Professionals.
rich bastard ruined my life.
excellent motive for murder.
what are you talking about?
richard Cole is dead, and I'm thinking you killed him and took off.
no.
I left to do damage control.
my wife won't even let me in the front door.
she wouldn't even talk to me.
look, I have no idea who killed Cole, but what he did to me, he deserved it.
angela scanned the castings I made of the fatal injuries so we can get a better sense of the murder weapon.
Yeah, and I cleaned up the edges, and these are the shapes that caused the injuries.
which means that Cole wasn't killed there.
no two of these injuries share the same impact surface area.
VAZIRI: I know.
so it appears the guy was hit with various weapons that were each used once.
well, you know, this could be a tailpiece.
a what?
and- and that could be a tremolo arm, which means that those lines are from strings.
Hodgins: Wait a minute.
out victim was beaten to death with a guitar?
I've actually seen this before.
solid body guitars can prove quite lethal.
VAZIRI: There have to be over 50 guitars at the fantasy camp.
without cause, we can't get warrants for all of them.
Yeah, but that shape.
I mean, the bottom is too curved to be a Tele or a Strat, but...
it's not an SG because the tailpiece wraps around, and then there's the distance to the jack plate.
you know, I think we're looking for a '57 Gibson Les Paul.
that is so hot that you know that.
interesting. It's- it's interesting.
well, it's not like I know every guitar, but I do know the expensive ones.
how expensive?
I'd say our victim was beaten to death by about a quarter of a million dollars.
SAROYAN: And then after a perfectly nice evening,
I could tell he didn't even want to shake my hand.
he looked positively pained.
he's a science professor.
no. Associate professor.
people get weird when they find out that I handle dead people all day.
now I just say I'm an insurance underwriter.
good one.
I'm an accountant.
no. - Oh, yeah.
no one wants to talk about work with an accountant.
or an insurance underwriter.
except other accountants or underwriters.
so, do we share any other great deceptions?
I can make a coin disappear and come out of your ear.
I hate magic. I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.
but it always worked for my Uncle Dave.
of course he was in a nursing home.
am I smiling like a fool?
cause that would be embarrassing.
Ah, well, you look beautiful embarrassed.
then I'll keep smiling.
I should get back to the office.
and I have a murder to solve.
Oh, right.
um, what do you say we catch a movie on the weekend?
Yeah.
I'll see what my parental duties are and give you a call?
sounds good.
BOOTH: Do you remember when Simon told us that Cole showed up at camp with a fancy guitar?
Yeah, he wasn't kidding. A '57 Gibson Les Paul?
Yeah, well, it disappeared at the same time that Cole did.
you think he was killed for his guitar?
all we know is, he was killed with his guitar.
with a '57 Gibson Les Paul.
that's like whacking someone with the Mona Lisa.
I got agents checking out dealers in the area.
see if anyone tried to sell it.
well, unless the killer destroyed it.
killing something like that would be like killing Altamont or, uh, "Smells Like Teen Spirit."
you know, the guitar has long been recognized as an unconscious symbol of copulation.
the, uh, head and the shaft are phallic, the body feminine.
maybe our killer was acting out of sexual confusion.
or maybe someone just wanted the guitar.
wouldn't you? - Yeah.
Oh, look at this. I got a hit, dealer in DC got the guitar,
said it was brought in by a woman with a pierced eyebrow.
whatever. Jimi Hendrix choked to death on his own vomit.
the autopsy was inconsistent, and Hendrix's manager confessed to shoving pills and red wine down his throat, hoping to cash in on an insurance policy.
you really know your rock and roll deaths.
Oh, hi again. Yeah, I guess I do.
we need you to come with us.
what for?
we have some unanswered questions about Kurt Cobain's death.
we thought maybe you could give us some insight.
Seriously?
I believe he was being ironic.
but if you do have information about this Cobain person,
I'm sure the FBI would appreciate that, too.
Thanks, Bones.
Cole is dead.
I thought he was just missing.
BOOTH: That why you thought you'd get away with selling his quarter-of-a-million- dollar guitar?
how much?
that dealer totally ripped me off.
stay on topic, all right?
after Dalton's party, I snuck into Cole's room and took the guitar.
it was sitting on the stand all polished.
he usually kept it filthy.
I don't know why he suddenly gave a crap about it.
how did you get in?
I had a key.
We...hooked up the first night of camp.
you know, after all the loser musicians I dated,
I thought I finally found a decent guy, but...
what happened?
Cole told me that he was planning on sleeping with every woman at camp as part of his own "rock and roll fantasy.
he thanked me for being such low-hanging fruit.
so you killed him and you stole his guitar.
he was a poseur. He didn't deserve that guitar.
look, I know it was wrong to take it, but I swear to God, I didn't kill him.
I believe her.
me, too. Too bad she's going to prison for grand theft.
then who killed Cole?
well, everything that you've learned about the victim, uh, indicates that he was only interested in the external signifiers of the rock and roll lifestyle, correct?
Yes, the clothes, the instruments, the groupers.
groupies, Bones.
well, groupers would be more logical.
male groupers have harems of multiple females.
if you enter into a social contract with a marine biologist, you should know these things.
Yeah, well, a fish can't play the guitar.
well, apparently, neither could Cole.
you don't have to keep bringing up Catherine.
well, you're welcome to bring up Andrew.
I have an opinion on motive, if anyone's interested.
right.
to a true music fan, the fact that Richard Cole was playing the ultimate guitar would be sacrilegious, profane, even.
and the fact that the killer put it back in Cole's room, rather than destroy it, further demonstrates his reverence for rock and roll.
so, you're saying that the music is the motive.
I know it's wrong, but I am liking our killer better than our victim.
this is gorgeous.
I wish my dad was here.
no prints other than those of the dealer.
the killer did an excellent cleaning job.
take it apart. See if he missed anything.
okay, um...
I'm not going to watch that.
I'll do it in the Ookey Room.
Arastoo, little help here?
will you excuse me?
Dr. Lidner left a message at the house.
was there anything wrong with your tests?
no.
he was confirming your date for Saturday night.
that. Yes.
I was going to tell you...
you're dating my gynecologist?
it wasn't my fault. It just happened.
what?
think about what you'd say if I said that to you.
I'd ground you.
I'm...Sorry. We had lunch. We liked each other. That's all.
and that was wrong.
very, very wrong.
is that why you sent me to him?
so you could get a date?
I know you haven't seen anyone since I've been living with you.
no. He's a good doctor. That's all.
who just happens to be cute.
Yes. No. God.
why didn't you tell me? Don't you trust me?
you have to sneak around behind my back?
no. Wait. How did we switch roles here?
I can't go back to him now.
that would be extremely skeevy.
we just had lunch. I swear. I will never see him again. I promise.
Yes, you will.
what?
you've been so focused on being a good mother that you've totally ignored yourself.
do you know what kind of pressure that puts on me?
no, I...I didn't realize.
you need a life- for my sake.
but don't sneak around behind my back.
you two seem like a good fit. Have a little fun.
but don't go too fast. You're out of practice.
excuse me?
I thought you believed in honesty.
all right. I'll go slow. Very, very slow.
and find me a new doctor- a woman.
sure. Right away.
I've got to get back to school.
love you.
love you, too.
what do you have, Dr. Hodgins? Anything?
a walk? A single?
don't strike out, please.
Mr. Vaziri, your obsession with sport will no doubt diminish your mental acuity.
Oh, on the contrary, Dr. Brennan, baseball is a game built on mathematical certainty, the physics of force and velocity, as well as its anthropological significance as being one of the unifying cultural traditions for Americans.
intellectually, it's quite stimulating, and, uh, I like swinging a bat.
okay, this fret is cracked.
what, from impact?
no, no.
the cracks are tiny.
Yeah, you know, every fret in the lower register is cracked.
the guitar is old.
Yeah, but that doesn't matter.
this is from chlorine.
see, the frets are made out of nickel, and nickel reacts like this when exposed to chlorine.
there's a rooftop pool at the hotel.
if Cole was murdered there, the killer might have cleaned the guitar with pure chlorine.
that's why it was so clean when Bebe stole it.
well, the strings are made out of nickel, too, aren't they?
Yeah, but they're brand-new.
I mean, there's no cracking.
VAZIRI: The killer must have known he couldn't get all the blood off, so he didn't even try.
well, if the killer restrung the guitar, then maybe he left us a little present.
bingo.
brennan: Is that a hair?
Yes. Yes, it is.
purple.
I think I know whose that is.
someone who would kill to play with Erik Dalton.
I believe we would call this a home run.
guess what, uh, kind of pick Bebe said Gino uses.
woolly mammoth?
man: Yeah, rock and roll!
gino: Come on! I love it! Yeah!
I couldn't let that poser play with it.
go ahead, man.
it was worth it.
I'm sure it was.
come on.
woman: The Feds busted Gino, man.
BOOTH: You know, our killer plays a mean guitar.
I'm sure that they have, you know, a band in prison for him.
you're a very good singer.
thank you, Bones.
and you...you play the guitar in a very interesting fashion.
I know.
does Catherine play?
I don't know.
only been out with her twice, Bones.
last night, Andrew gave me a CD with music he likes.
Mix-tape.
talk about a social contract.
that's what I surmised.
our partnership is still important to me.
you know that, right?
sure.
Yeah.
you die for your partner.
that's the way I look at it.
I liked Andrew's taste in music except for a band called Led Zeppelin.
except for a band called Led Zeppelin"?
Yes.
what? You kidding me? Led Zeppelin is, like, the best rock and roll band ever.
I mean, they had a reunion tour in '07 in London.
I would have killed for those tickets.
Really? My publisher offered me tickets, but when I heard "Zeppelin,
I thought it was for some sort of air show.
air show? You turned down what probably was the last concert that Zeppelin would ever play?
are you going to kill me?
you're unbelievable!
well, it's just a band, Booth.
it's not just a band, okay?
this is Led Zeppelin. You know what? I am your partner.
you offer your partner those kind of things.
I didn't know that. - Offer your partner the tickets.
help me!
help me!
Dr. Brennan!
Hodgins! - Dr. Brennan, help me!
booth! God!
stay with me.
help!
the gravedigger case finally begins today with an evidentiary hearing.
the defendant, prominent federal prosecutor Heather Taffet, will be defending herself against multiple charges of kidnapping and murder.
one charge involves ten-year-old Terrence Gilroy, who has never been found.
testimony is expected from three kidnapping victims:
seely Booth, an Agent with the FBI, as well as scientist Jack Hodgins and Temperance Brennan of the Jeffers...
you okay, Bones?
of course. Why wouldn't I be?
well, we're about to come head to head with the woman who tried to kill both of us.
so are you. Aren't you okay?
sure. Yeah. You know, I'm just checkin' in.
I just want to make sure you're okay and if you need anything, I...
it's just another case, Booth.
right. - Dad!
what, what are you doing here?
I just thought you should have a little support from somebody who's been through the legal system a few times.
why is everyone treating me like a child?
because I don't want you to get your hopes up. This is far from a slam dunk.
that's exactly why Caroline is here, all right?
we have five cases, multiple counts:
bones, Hodgins, the ten-year-old boy...
whose body has never been found.
your prosecutor's getting desperate.
Max, she knows what she's doing, okay?
I thought you were here for support, dad.
okay, you all ready to play nice?
always, your honor.
your honor, since I'm representing myself, I'd like to request that my shackles be removed while I'm in court.
this is only an evidentiary hearing, your honor.
there's no jury to prejudice.
and frankly, I feel a bit more secure with her in chains.
spare us the dramatic flourishes, Ms. Julian.
when we go to trial, we can revisit the request, Ms. Taffet. First witness.
burn marks were found on the victims that were consistent with injuries one would sustain from a three-million volt stun gun.
the stun gun was found in the suspect's storage locker.
it matches the stun gun that was used in the attack on me, as well as...
the suspect's steel-toed boots were also found in the storage locker.
this storage locker was found with information obtained illegally, wasn't it?
we didn't know that at the time, your honor.
we obtained a legal warrant to search the locker.
the fact that Agent Booth's brother gave you the lead didn't make you suspicious?
he was an officer assigned to homeland security.
we had no reason to question the information he provided.
the warrant was obtained without malice.
that's irrelevant, your honor.
everything found in that storage locker should be dismissed.
I submit that a warrant wasn't even necessary.
under precedent of imminent danger, law authority had the duty to enter that storage locker without a valid warrant.
agent Booth's life was in danger.
imminent danger applies only if law enforcement hears a violent threat or struggle at the scene.
I'm sorry, Ms. Julian, but no matter how pure the intention, the warrant was obtained illegally.
therefore, any and all evidence gathered during the search and seizure is inadmissible.
thank you, your honor.
this was not a personal favor, Ms. Taffet.
I am restrained by the law.
I'd like to move that all charges be dropped, your honor.
you'd like that, wouldn't you?
we still have dirt samples from the crime scene, - the ransom tapes - Your honor, this is a waste of the court's time and the taxpayers' money.
if I lose, I'll send everyone a note of apology.
you aren't left with much, Ms. Julian.
are you sure you want to proceed?
Yes, your honor.
okay. The charges stand.
we're going to trial.
court is adjourned.
if you're so brilliant, Dr. Brennan, why couldn't you find something as simple as the number?
let's go, come on.
you all right? What'd she say to you?
she says I missed some evidence. - Evidence?
she doesn't think I can find it.
booth is getting her arrest records, as well as old case files from when she was a prosecutor.
okay, uh, I'm pulling every record we have so far associated with Taffet social security numbers, birth dates, blood test results.
ages of the victims?
got those. I'm using a recursive search algorithm which analyzes and cross-references the data.
since they're related, any inconsistencies can raise a red flag.
I think Taffet is just messing with us again.
no, I have to disagree. I mean, her pathology is consistent;
this is all a game to her.
she won the first round, so now she's upping the stakes by challenging Dr. Brennan.
Yeah, or maybe she knows there's something in the soil samples we already have, so she's just trying to distract us.
you analyzed those soil samples a hundred times.
are you telling me to give up, Sweets?
no, of course not.
but I mean, I understand the need to cling to anything...
"Cling"? Okay, so I'm crazy now.
that's not what I meant. - Go, Dr. Hodgins.
look at the soil again. You might find something.
you know, he still gets nightmares.
says he wakes up in a sweat.
I should have been more sensitive.
this must be difficult for you, too. If you need any...
I'm fine. What about the weight and size of the victim's remains?
Yeah, it's a good idea. I'll check it out.
here are the first set of documents you asked for.
more numbers than I've ever seen in my life.
right. Thanks. You okay?
Oh, you mean because this case is a career killer?
I'm cute. I can always find a job.
come on. Look, they're gonna come up with something. They always do, right?
do you really believe that, cherie?
well, they saved my life, remember? And that was impossible.
I'll give you that one.
so, how's your girlfriend holding up?
she's fine.
she's not my girlfriend.
Oh, so those little looks between you?
nothing. - Right.
I hope you're more believable on the stand.
have Angela run these numbers as quickly as she can.
the judge isn't gonna give me more than a day.
if I don't receive the money in the numbered account within eight hours, your child will die.
this is the last time you will hear from me.
there will be no further communications.
what happened to the numbers?
well, I came up dry.
Brennan and Booth are compiling another set.
but until then, I'm trying to drag Taffet's voice from these ransom tapes.
well, any luck?
she used a variable band inversion, so the wave is broken up into hundreds of small sections, each section scrambled with different frequency sequencing.
you didn't ask me if I found anything new in the soil samples.
did you? - No, of course not.
I mean, Sweets was right. You knew that.
I'm barely keeping it together here, Ang.
well, you were, uh, you were sane enough to marry me.
but I don't feel strong enough to tell anybody yet.
I feel like she's still got me locked up, you know?
I mean, when I see her, there's just this, um, anger, I mean, this kind of helplessness that...
I know, I know.
when I was buried in that car,
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again.
and now I feel like she's still in between us.
well, she's not.
look at me.
she's not.
nobody can get between us.
come on, Bones, you've been at it for hours. You gotta eat something.
in a little while.
her old court documents from when she was a prosecutor have case numbers, criminal code numbers, and then there are zip codes.
well, that's great and all, but you know, it's not gonna be any good if you starve yourself to death.
she was laughing at me, Booth.
I-I can't let her win.
she won't. - You hope.
she may be amoral, but she is brilliant.
well, you're more brilliant.
what if her dispassion makes her more logical?
what if that gives her an advantage over me?
wait a second. Now you're upset because you're not more like a psychopath?
I just think maybe I've lost my advantage because of all the people I'm involved with now.
all of the relationships- they complicate logical thought.
you don't mean that.
could we please just work?
sure.
salt Lake City?
what?
when they arrested Taffet, she used her one phone call from jail to Salt Lake City.
area Code 801.
well, she's representing herself, so it couldn't be to a lawyer.
who would she call in Salt Lake City?
Larry's pizza, how may I help you?
none of the employees at the pizza place have a connection to Taffet, and...
none of them here have any criminal records.
well, the phone records show that Taffet hung up after ten seconds.
she didn't request another call.
Angela's matching the number with a numerical sequencing program.
this is the number, Booth.
this has to be the number.
so, I'm running a numerical sequencing program to see if there's a match with any of her victims.
but I'm coming up with nothing.
Oh, my God, the number is a GPS location.
let's go, everybody out.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
it's the kid, isn't it?
Terrence Gilroy had a remodeled right ulna from a break when he was eight.
this is the boy she kidnapped.
I'm going to call the parents.
why did she lead us here, Booth?
why did she want us to find him?
hands off!
ma'am? No one touches a thing.
what are you talking about?
this is our chance to get some hard evidence they can't dismiss.
not if you touch it.
you can't act as an expert witness in a case when you are also a victim.
we aren't victims in this crime.
we filed one complaint with seven counts.
since the trial started, you and Dr. Brennan are linked to all the crimes.
that's why Taffet wanted us to find the boy.
she knows we're the only people who have the skills to connect her to the crime.
and now our hands are tied.
not if you drop our case.
excuse me?
if Caroline doesn't prosecute our kidnappings, we'd be free to testify as expert witnesses in the boy's case.
U'd be willing to do that? - No.
no. Caroline has to prosecute our case
Taffet tried to kill us.
all of our evidence has been throw out.
the rational thing to do is to pursue a case with fresh, untainted evidence.
are you kidding me?!
is it really that easy for you to forget what happened to us?
I will never forget what happened to us, or to Booth, or this boy.
you are not the only one suffering, Dr. Hodgins.
but your emotions have no relevance not if we want to convict Taffet.
this better work.
I'll have the charges dismissed in the morning.
you can start right after that.
okay, so the Gilroy kid-- he was last seen at the Rockland Mall on June 23.
I'm gonna check all Taffet's credit card records for that day, too.
Caroline said you can't give expert testimony if she's prosecuting your case.
I told Caroline to drop my charges, too.
I'm not gonna let you do this alone.
she's going to see the judge tomorrow morning at 10: 00, and then we can dive in on all this.
Thanks, Booth.
we're partners, it's what we do.
right?
if Taffet is acquitted on this count, she can never be tried again.
maybe that's why she wanted us to find the boy.
Yeah, well, she's arrogant like Sweets said. And she's misjudging you.
I have nightmares, Booth.
Hodgins is bleeding...
you're drowning...
I-I can't help anyone.
look, all right, you know what?
she's never gonna get the better of you, all right? Just know that.
all right? I promise, okay?
these are perimortem fractures, bilaterally on the fifth, sixth and seventh ribs on the posterior axillary lines.
and injuries to the greater cornu and the left lateral thyroid and cricoid cartilages.
I see injuries like this in victims who've been strangled.
perhaps he struggled, and Taffet was trying to subdue him.
Taffet tasered all her victims.
three million volts. That should be enough to knock out a ten-year-old boy for at least a few hours.
he wasn't unconscious. These are defensive wounds, consistent with the boy resisting being placed in the freezer, arms outstretched.
I'll take samples from under his fingernails.
maybe he scratched her during the struggle.
maybe she knew the facts in this case wouldn't be consistent with the other crimes, and would give her reasonable doubt.
we have evidence from credit card charges that the defendant was at the Rockland Mall on the day that Terrence Gilroy was abducted.
the team at the Jeffersonian discovered that the number Taffet called...
turned out to be the same GPS coordinates as to where the boy was buried.
the same M. O. , same ransom tape, the same demands as the other kidnappings.
do you have any evidence that the Gilroy boy was abducted from the mall?
it was the last place he was seen.
so, no.
did anyone else make any purchases at the mall that day, or was it just me?
of course they did, but...
as for the phone call that I allegedly made, is it possible that the number was placed in my file by mistake?
objection. Conjecture. - Sustained.
did you know that the officer on duty the night I was arrested was from Salt Lake?
answer the question, Agent Booth.
no.
isn't it more likely that he made that call, and the number was placed in my file by mistake?
objection. Conjecture again.
I thought it was reasonable doubt.
very reasonable.
your honor... withdrawn.
no further questions, your honor.
you know that Taffet's playing you, right?
we're fine, Max.
no, she's got you all on defense.
we got the boy, all right?
it's because she wanted you to.
every psycho takes one step too far and hangs themself.
not before a lot of innocent people get hurt.
I'll see you later.
Hey, sorry to bother you. You have a minute?
Yeah, sure.
how's it going?
I don't know, actually.
that's why I'm here. I-I'm...
I'm worried, Dr. Sweets. I-I...
this case is taking its toll on everyone.
including you?
including me, yes.
it's a very stressful situation.
I mean, you're not immune to that.
I feel like everything's fraying around the edges.
we're all searching for some piece of evidence that can put Taffet away.
but we keep coming up empty. Everyone feels manipulated by her.
and I-I should be able to pull everyone together
keep them on track.
you want to guarantee the outcome.
I wish that were possible.
but you know, we knew this was going to be an uphill battle.
but did we really believe that?
we all knew she was guilty.
so someplace, we assumed that in a just world she'd pay for what she did.
that assumes a just world, I'm afraid.
these are my people she hurt, my friends.
I should be able to do something.
I know.
Max, you didn't think I was going to follow you?
Max, is this what you want?
don't trust the system, Booth.
you miss, you compromise the case, Taffet walks.
I don't miss!
when are you gonna learn to stop messing with me, huh?
you're making a big mistake.
Tempe could die.
Yeah, come on.
he tried to kill her?
well, he had a rifle pointed right at her, so you do the math.
Why? Why would he do that?
to protect you. And a career criminal like Max
he obviously doesn't trust the legal system.
I'm sorry, Booth.
I wish he were different. - Yeah, me, too.
you know, he socked me in the eye, too.
Hey, honey.
I need you to bail me out.
What?! No, dad.
I was doing it for you.
no, I don't want you to kill people for me.
just buy me a sweater, like a regular dad.
leave her alone, Max.
booth says you're not getting out until after the trial over.
I have to go. - Whoa. I've got a bad back.
you know what the beds are like in jail.
good-bye, dad.
look, I'm sorry, Bones.
I'm sure this is the last thing you want to deal with.
Yeah.
part of me wishes he'd done it.
well, not the good part, so let's just keep our eye on the ball.
so, any news about the boy?
I'm getting an accurate recreation of the assailant from the fracture patterns on his remains, and it's a match for Taffet.
I'm putting a presentation together for court.
the kid-- he put up a good fight, huh?
there's evidence of strong resistance.
Yes. - Yeah, at least he didn't go easy.
Parker... he'd do the same thing.
probably bite her ear off and run.
he'd bite her? - Yeah.
Ten-year-olds- it's kind of their thing.
they bite.
I have to get back to the lab.
if the boy bit her, there should be some evidence on his maxilla, mandible or his teeth.
the teeth seem to have been cleaned.
Taffet probably wiped them off.
second left premolar is chipped.
there might be some trace in the abrasion, maybe some tissue from Heather Taffet.
saliva contains amylase that would have broken down any bits of tissue.
not if it were imbedded between the teeth or under the gum line.
if I don't receive the money in the numbered account within eight hours, your child will die.
this is the last...
okay, this encryption is a rolling code split band voice inversion.
individual frequencies between the clicks are inverted and recombined.
I applied software that decrypts each of the 423 separate segments until the voice becomes clear.
if I don't receive the money in the numbered account within eight hours, your child will die.
this is the last time you will hear from me.
there will be no further... - You did it, Angela.
it's Taffet.
like to see her explain away that one.
if I don't receive the money in the numbered account within eight hours, your child will die.
this is the last time you will hear from me.
there will be no further communications.
and in your expert opinion, Ms. Montenegro, whose voice is that?
it's Heather Taffet.
the frequency and vocal patterns are an exact match when compared to unencrypted recordings of her voice.
thank you.
no further questions.
that was very impressive, Ms. Montenegro.
could you share your credentials with the court?
I have a bachelor of fine arts from the University of Texas with a minor in computer science.
and I've also studied biomedical illustration at American University.
but you do not have a degree in sound engineering, is that correct?
no.
objection. Ms. Montenegro has numerous patents pending from her work in auditory forensic reconstruction.
the homeless man on my street has a patent pending for a time machine.
that doesn't mean I'm going to ask him to testify in court.
that's enough, Ms. Taffet.
do you have anything else for this witness?
Yes, your honor.
I'd like to introduce into evidence item 461b, which is a deconstruction of the same ransom tape by former FBI special Agent Graham Steele, who has a Phd in forensic auditory analysis from the University of Pennsylvania.
if I don't receive the money in the numbered account within eight hours, your child will die.
th-that isn't me.
he obviously manipulated the pitch and the timbre of the voice.
isn't that what you did? - No.
those sound waves have an underlying pattern of frequency modulation.
like a fingerprint.
whatever the technical jargon, it seems clear that anyone, even someone without any credentials, can make one voice sound like another.
Objection!
counsel is making speeches.
sustained. - I'm sorry, your honor.
no further questions.
Hey, Bones, you ready for court?
Yes. I have a video presentation which shows the victim sustained rib fractures as well as a fracture of the lateral epicondyle of the left distal...
what do you say we ease up on the scientific stuff, okay?
the science gives us the height of the assailant.
162 centimeters-- Taffet's height.
that's, that's, that's good and all, but Taffet's kind of had a field day, you know, trashing the whole technical goobledy stuff.
and the jury seems to like her for it.
but those are the facts.
it's how you present the facts that win or lose a case.
bones, the jury needs to know what that little boy went through.
I've...
I've testified before, Booth.
I'll be fine. We-we should go.
okay.
Terrence Gilroy's left greater cornu of the hyoid was compressed, indicating that the assailant strangled the young boy using only one hand
the dominant left hand, in this case.
I'd like to submit writing samples which confirm that the defendant is left-handed.
no objection, as long as it's also noted that eight percent of the general population is also left-handed.
including you, your honor.
continue.
the victim sustained a fracture of the lateral epicondyle and the shaft of the left distal humerus.
perhaps I can be clearer.
Terrence Gilroy's bones could only have been broken by someone kneeling on top of him as they pushed him into the freezer.
the radiating fracture lines show that this assailant had to be between 125 and 135 pounds
the weight of the defendant. - Objection. This is speculation.
are you questioning my qualifications?
because you will not find a more experienced or respected forensic anthropologist anywhere in the world.
so I'd appreciate not being interrupted until I finish testifying.
Dr. Brennan,
I'll make the rulings here.
overruled. Continue.
since these broken bones were caused by the assailant's knees and the chipping on the boy's kneecaps was caused by the toes of her heavy boots, we can determine the length of her shin.
and what is the significance of the shin length?
it gives us the height of the assailant, which is five feet, four inches.
the same height as the defendant.
it is clear from the circumstantial evidence and these facts that this child was attacked with vicious cruelty by Ms. Taffet.
objection.
the jury makes that determination, not the witness.
the five-foot-four assailant...
crushed the boy's chest, choked him, and finally caused him a torturous death by burying him alive.
objection. Speculation.
she can't know what the witness felt.
I was buried alive.
which makes me uniquely qualified to comment on its horror.
objection, your honor. This is grandstanding.
unless the witness has any additional facts...
sustained.
do you have any further questions for Dr. Brennan, Ms. Julian?
no, your honor.
I learned everything I need to know.
your witness.
Dr. Brennan, don't you think your trauma as a kidnapping victim prevents you from being objective?
objection. She is testifying as an expert witness, not a victim.
she brought up being buried alive, your honor.
she did, Ms. Julian.
overruled.
it's only natural that you would want to construct facts that would give you some closure and peace.
I resent your implication.
I do not let my emotions cloud my findings.
no, not intentionally, of course.
is there a question coming?
Yes. Sorry.
Dr. Brennan, you are currently seeing an FBI psychologist, are you not?
what... that has nothing to do with...
a yes or no is all that's required,
Dr. Brennan.
are you currently seeing an FBI psychologist?
Yes, but... Thank you.
no further questions. No, that has nothing to do with this case.
my findings are sound.
you may step down, Dr. Brennan. My findings are sound.
a dust mite?
so that little bug is gonna save us?
Oh, don't call it a bug.
sounds insulting.
we reexamined the boy's teeth and found it wedged between the right lateral incisor and canine.
dust mites eat dead human skin cells.
and this one's stomach sac is full.
if the boy bit Taffet, the skin cells are probably hers.
whatever's left is gonna be small, but there might be enough to give us DNA.
this is a dermatophagoides farinae.
for those of us who don't speak insect, what is that, exactly?
it's a dust mite
an insect found on clothes, but it also feeds on the cells of the person wearing those clothes.
and where was this dust mite found?
between Terrence Gilroy's teeth.
it was transferred there when the boy bit the person who kidnapped him.
and how do we know that?
the dust mite contained human female epithelial cells.
we extracted those cells and ran them through several DNA databases.
the cells belonged to Heather Taffet.
nothing further, your honor.
your witness, Ms. Taffet.
it seems that you have neglected to include a sample of the evidence that I could have tested independently.
since there were so few cells in the mite, the testing destroyed the sample, but the procedures and results are all contained in our documentation.
let me get this right.
I have access to your notes, but I can't examine the actual evidence because you destroyed it?
your honor, in California versus Trombetta, the Supreme Court ruled that the prosecution could destroy a sample to test for DNA because there was no bad faith.
bad faith?
the motives of every single person at the Jeffersonian are suspect, and now their only physical evidence is gone
if it existed at all.
I've just about had it with your snide, unsubstantiated allegations.
as have I. - That's enough, Ms. Julian.
your honor, I would like to file a motion to have this unverifiable DNA evidence dismissed.
protocol has been followed, Ms. Taffet.
it's up to the jury to decide how the evidence will figure in the outcome of this case.
your motion is denied.
did you see Taffet's face? She was completely blindsided.
okay, Caroline's closing
it's going to kill.
all right, so here we go.
that's it, huh?
are you okay, Bones?
your team just nailed Taffet.
I'm just tired.
Yeah. Yeah. It's been a... it's been a tough case.
it's not just the case.
I'm tired of all of it.
I'm tired of dealing with murders and victims and sadness and pain.
well, Bones, that's what we do.
all right? We catch the bad people, and we make the world a better place.
no, Booth. That's what you do, and somehow, - I got caught up into it. - Wait a sec.
hold on. You were dealing with dead people long before we got together.
as a researcher, an anthropologist.
that's how I can make the world a better place.
and you do. Come on.
you make the world a great place.
Hey. Cheers to that, all right?
you're just anxious.
all right? And tomorrow, when we have won, everything will be perfect.
it'll be fine.
we are here to seek justice for this ten year-old boy who was kidnapped, brutally beaten and buried alive by Heather Taffet.
Taffet was seen where this child was abducted.
she matches the size of the assailant.
she's left-handed.
her voice was discovered on the ransom tapes.
it all sounds very reasonable, doesn't it?
these so-called facts were compiled by people who themselves were victims of a vicious criminal who has not yet been caught.
they need a scapegoat.
but only Heather Taffet could have the DNA that was found in this child's mouth.
that evidence was delivered to us in death by this brave boy.
and yet, the only people who saw that dust mite, the only people who touched the alleged epithelial cells were two kidnap victims
one a known conspiracy theorist, the other a traumatized anthropologist who's currently being treated by a psychologist.
and Dr. Saroyan, who couldn't perform her job without destroying the evidence, conveniently preventing me from mounting a defense.
because she has no defense, except slandering these experts.
they have told you what Heather Taffet did to that boy.
the law is clear.
you cannot convict a person based on innuendo or groundless accusations.
I weep for that boy.
no child should suffer like that, and whoever did this...
...should never be allowed to walk among decent people again.
for that boy, for justice, you must return a verdict of...
...not guilty.
because it's clear that I am a scapegoat.
I am innocent.
thank you.
What'd I tell you, huh? Caroline nailed it in there.
Taffet was pretty convincing in there, too. - You know what, Hodgins?
you ever see the bright side in things?
you know what, Booth? You're right.
because no matter what happens in there, - I've got Angela. - Hodgins.
it's okay.
I don't care, Angie.
look, Taffet's not going to make the rules anymore.
I want our friends to know.
I want everybody to know. Okay.
angela and I are married.
what? - Ohh...
Hey, look at that, huh?
what? When, Ang? - In jail.
Hodgins wanted to wait until this was over, so everybody could be happy for us.
this isn't another pregnancy scare, is it?
no. No, this is...
this is love.
so... Why were you hiding this from us?
Oh, I was having trouble dealing with things because of the trial.
then I thought... screw it.
the jury's back.
the defendant will rise for the reading of the verdict.
in count one, the kidnapping of Terrence Gilroy, the jury finds the defendant, Heather Taffet, guilty.
order, or I will clear the court.
in count two, the murder of Terrence Gilroy, the jury finds the defendant...
guilty.
the defendant is remanded into custody until sentencing.
we are adjourned.
this isn't over.
I was out of town for a couple of days.
well, I knew Tempe had everything under control.
she didn't need me. - Uh-huh.
all right, let's just raise our glasses here.
to the squints, okay? - Come on. To Booth.
Hey! Oh, and Caroline.
hear, hear. - Hear, hear.
you know, I never doubted any of you- not for a minute.
Where'd you come from? Oh, come on.
Oh, please.
okay, let's not forget the happy couple over here.
Yes, best wishes for a successful blending of familial obligations, as well as monetary and property consolidation.
what?
I guess I'll go home.
a real bed is probably going to feel good.
I'm sorry that I, uh... that I doubted you.
sweets would say that subconsciously you wanted Booth to catch you so you and I wouldn't have to be separated again.
smart guy, that Sweets.
I love you, honey.
thanks for leaving me with the bill again.
that's nice of you. - Your fault, Booth.
my wallet got stolen in jail.
Yeah. - Bye.
can't believe they actually got hitched.
I know.
I have this sense that everything's changing, Booth.
well, not everything.
look-- we're still partners.
right?
and-and Taffet... She's... she's put away.
I mean, you're feeling good about that, right?
you almost died, Booth.
that can happen again. What if, next time, I can't get to you?
it's not going to happen again.
I envy your ability to substitute optimism for reality.
you know what? Maybe you just need to take some time off.
go to a beach.
lay in the sun.
I might need more than a little time.
don't make any decisions about your future right now.
I'm just staying...
you know when a dentist gives you anesthetic and tells you not to operate any heavy machinery or make any important decisions within 24 hours?
all right, this case was bigger than a root canal.
come on, let's just go back inside and have one more drink. Come on.
just one. - -No. I'm tired, Booth.
I-I-I'm going to go home.
all right. Come on.
let's... we'll get you in the cab.
I know, it's... it's been a long, long day.
all right, get in there, all right?
Hey. I'll see you tomorrow, all right?
help me!
help me!
Dr. Brennan!
Hodgins! - Dr. Brennan, help me!
booth! God!
stay with me.
help!
the gravedigger case finally begins today with an evidentiary hearing.
the defendant, prominent federal prosecutor Heather Taffet, will be defending herself against multiple charges of kidnapping and murder.
one charge involves ten-year-old Terrence Gilroy, who has never been found.
testimony is expected from three kidnapping victims:
seely Booth, an Agent with the FBI, as well as scientist Jack Hodgins and Temperance Brennan of the Jeffers...
you okay, Bones?
of course. Why wouldn't I be?
well, we're about to come head to head with the woman who tried to kill both of us.
so are you. Aren't you okay?
sure. Yeah. You know, I'm just checkin' in.
I just want to make sure you're okay and if you need anything, I...
it's just another case, Booth.
right. - Dad!
what, what are you doing here?
I just thought you should have a little support from somebody who's been through the legal system a few times.
why is everyone treating me like a child?
because I don't want you to get your hopes up. This is far from a slam dunk.
that's exactly why Caroline is here, all right?
we have five cases, multiple counts:
bones, Hodgins, the ten-year-old boy...
whose body has never been found.
your prosecutor's getting desperate.
Max, she knows what she's doing, okay?
I thought you were here for support, dad.
okay, you all ready to play nice?
always, your honor.
your honor, since I'm representing myself, I'd like to request that my shackles be removed while I'm in court.
this is only an evidentiary hearing, your honor.
there's no jury to prejudice.
and frankly, I feel a bit more secure with her in chains.
spare us the dramatic flourishes, Ms. Julian.
when we go to trial, we can revisit the request, Ms. Taffet. First witness.
burn marks were found on the victims that were consistent with injuries one would sustain from a three-million volt stun gun.
the stun gun was found in the suspect's storage locker.
it matches the stun gun that was used in the attack on me, as well as...
the suspect's steel-toed boots were also found in the storage locker.
this storage locker was found with information obtained illegally, wasn't it?
we didn't know that at the time, your honor.
we obtained a legal warrant to search the locker.
the fact that Agent Booth's brother gave you the lead didn't make you suspicious?
he was an officer assigned to homeland security.
we had no reason to question the information he provided.
the warrant was obtained without malice.
that's irrelevant, your honor.
everything found in that storage locker should be dismissed.
I submit that a warrant wasn't even necessary.
under precedent of imminent danger, law authority had the duty to enter that storage locker without a valid warrant.
agent Booth's life was in danger.
imminent danger applies only if law enforcement hears a violent threat or struggle at the scene.
I'm sorry, Ms. Julian, but no matter how pure the intention, the warrant was obtained illegally.
therefore, any and all evidence gathered during the search and seizure is inadmissible.
thank you, your honor.
this was not a personal favor, Ms. Taffet.
I am restrained by the law.
I'd like to move that all charges be dropped, your honor.
you'd like that, wouldn't you?
we still have dirt samples from the crime scene, - the ransom tapes - Your honor, this is a waste of the court's time and the taxpayers' money.
if I lose, I'll send everyone a note of apology.
you aren't left with much, Ms. Julian.
are you sure you want to proceed?
Yes, your honor.
okay. The charges stand.
we're going to trial.
court is adjourned.
if you're so brilliant, Dr. Brennan, why couldn't you find something as simple as the number?
let's go, come on.
you all right? What'd she say to you?
she says I missed some evidence. - Evidence?
she doesn't think I can find it.
booth is getting her arrest records, as well as old case files from when she was a prosecutor.
okay, uh, I'm pulling every record we have so far associated with Taffet social security numbers, birth dates, blood test results.
ages of the victims?
got those. I'm using a recursive search algorithm which analyzes and cross-references the data.
since they're related, any inconsistencies can raise a red flag.
I think Taffet is just messing with us again.
no, I have to disagree. I mean, her pathology is consistent;
this is all a game to her.
she won the first round, so now she's upping the stakes by challenging Dr. Brennan.
Yeah, or maybe she knows there's something in the soil samples we already have, so she's just trying to distract us.
you analyzed those soil samples a hundred times.
are you telling me to give up, Sweets?
no, of course not.
but I mean, I understand the need to cling to anything...
"Cling"? Okay, so I'm crazy now.
that's not what I meant. - Go, Dr. Hodgins.
look at the soil again. You might find something.
you know, he still gets nightmares.
says he wakes up in a sweat.
I should have been more sensitive.
this must be difficult for you, too. If you need any...
I'm fine. What about the weight and size of the victim's remains?
Yeah, it's a good idea. I'll check it out.
here are the first set of documents you asked for.
more numbers than I've ever seen in my life.
right. Thanks. You okay?
Oh, you mean because this case is a career killer?
I'm cute. I can always find a job.
come on. Look, they're gonna come up with something. They always do, right?
do you really believe that, cherie?
well, they saved my life, remember? And that was impossible.
I'll give you that one.
so, how's your girlfriend holding up?
she's fine.
she's not my girlfriend.
Oh, so those little looks between you?
nothing. - Right.
I hope you're more believable on the stand.
have Angela run these numbers as quickly as she can.
the judge isn't gonna give me more than a day.
if I don't receive the money in the numbered account within eight hours, your child will die.
this is the last time you will hear from me.
there will be no further communications.
what happened to the numbers?
well, I came up dry.
Brennan and Booth are compiling another set.
but until then, I'm trying to drag Taffet's voice from these ransom tapes.
well, any luck?
she used a variable band inversion, so the wave is broken up into hundreds of small sections, each section scrambled with different frequency sequencing.
you didn't ask me if I found anything new in the soil samples.
did you? - No, of course not.
I mean, Sweets was right. You knew that.
I'm barely keeping it together here, Ang.
well, you were, uh, you were sane enough to marry me.
but I don't feel strong enough to tell anybody yet.
I feel like she's still got me locked up, you know?
I mean, when I see her, there's just this, um, anger, I mean, this kind of helplessness that...
I know, I know.
when I was buried in that car,
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again.
and now I feel like she's still in between us.
well, she's not.
look at me.
she's not.
nobody can get between us.
come on, Bones, you've been at it for hours. You gotta eat something.
in a little while.
her old court documents from when she was a prosecutor have case numbers, criminal code numbers, and then there are zip codes.
well, that's great and all, but you know, it's not gonna be any good if you starve yourself to death.
she was laughing at me, Booth.
I-I can't let her win.
she won't. - You hope.
she may be amoral, but she is brilliant.
well, you're more brilliant.
what if her dispassion makes her more logical?
what if that gives her an advantage over me?
wait a second. Now you're upset because you're not more like a psychopath?
I just think maybe I've lost my advantage because of all the people I'm involved with now.
all of the relationships- they complicate logical thought.
you don't mean that.
could we please just work?
sure.
salt Lake City?
what?
when they arrested Taffet, she used her one phone call from jail to Salt Lake City.
area Code 801.
well, she's representing herself, so it couldn't be to a lawyer.
who would she call in Salt Lake City?
Larry's pizza, how may I help you?
none of the employees at the pizza place have a connection to Taffet, and...
none of them here have any criminal records.
well, the phone records show that Taffet hung up after ten seconds.
she didn't request another call.
Angela's matching the number with a numerical sequencing program.
this is the number, Booth.
this has to be the number.
so, I'm running a numerical sequencing program to see if there's a match with any of her victims.
but I'm coming up with nothing.
Oh, my God, the number is a GPS location.
let's go, everybody out.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
it's the kid, isn't it?
Terrence Gilroy had a remodeled right ulna from a break when he was eight.
this is the boy she kidnapped.
I'm going to call the parents.
why did she lead us here, Booth?
why did she want us to find him?
hands off!
ma'am? No one touches a thing.
what are you talking about?
this is our chance to get some hard evidence they can't dismiss.
not if you touch it.
you can't act as an expert witness in a case when you are also a victim.
we aren't victims in this crime.
we filed one complaint with seven counts.
since the trial started, you and Dr. Brennan are linked to all the crimes.
that's why Taffet wanted us to find the boy.
she knows we're the only people who have the skills to connect her to the crime.
and now our hands are tied.
not if you drop our case.
excuse me?
if Caroline doesn't prosecute our kidnappings, we'd be free to testify as expert witnesses in the boy's case.
U'd be willing to do that? - No.
no. Caroline has to prosecute our case
Taffet tried to kill us.
all of our evidence has been throw out.
the rational thing to do is to pursue a case with fresh, untainted evidence.
are you kidding me?!
is it really that easy for you to forget what happened to us?
I will never forget what happened to us, or to Booth, or this boy.
you are not the only one suffering, Dr. Hodgins.
but your emotions have no relevance not if we want to convict Taffet.
this better work.
I'll have the charges dismissed in the morning.
you can start right after that.
okay, so the Gilroy kid-- he was last seen at the Rockland Mall on June 23.
I'm gonna check all Taffet's credit card records for that day, too.
Caroline said you can't give expert testimony if she's prosecuting your case.
I told Caroline to drop my charges, too.
I'm not gonna let you do this alone.
she's going to see the judge tomorrow morning at 10: 00, and then we can dive in on all this.
Thanks, Booth.
we're partners, it's what we do.
right?
if Taffet is acquitted on this count, she can never be tried again.
maybe that's why she wanted us to find the boy.
Yeah, well, she's arrogant like Sweets said. And she's misjudging you.
I have nightmares, Booth.
Hodgins is bleeding...
you're drowning...
I-I can't help anyone.
look, all right, you know what?
she's never gonna get the better of you, all right? Just know that.
all right? I promise, okay?
these are perimortem fractures, bilaterally on the fifth, sixth and seventh ribs on the posterior axillary lines.
and injuries to the greater cornu and the left lateral thyroid and cricoid cartilages.
I see injuries like this in victims who've been strangled.
perhaps he struggled, and Taffet was trying to subdue him.
Taffet tasered all her victims.
three million volts. That should be enough to knock out a ten-year-old boy for at least a few hours.
he wasn't unconscious. These are defensive wounds, consistent with the boy resisting being placed in the freezer, arms outstretched.
I'll take samples from under his fingernails.
maybe he scratched her during the struggle.
maybe she knew the facts in this case wouldn't be consistent with the other crimes, and would give her reasonable doubt.
we have evidence from credit card charges that the defendant was at the Rockland Mall on the day that Terrence Gilroy was abducted.
the team at the Jeffersonian discovered that the number Taffet called...
turned out to be the same GPS coordinates as to where the boy was buried.
the same M. O. , same ransom tape, the same demands as the other kidnappings.
do you have any evidence that the Gilroy boy was abducted from the mall?
it was the last place he was seen.
so, no.
did anyone else make any purchases at the mall that day, or was it just me?
of course they did, but...
as for the phone call that I allegedly made, is it possible that the number was placed in my file by mistake?
objection. Conjecture. - Sustained.
did you know that the officer on duty the night I was arrested was from Salt Lake?
answer the question, Agent Booth.
no.
isn't it more likely that he made that call, and the number was placed in my file by mistake?
objection. Conjecture again.
I thought it was reasonable doubt.
very reasonable.
your honor... withdrawn.
no further questions, your honor.
you know that Taffet's playing you, right?
we're fine, Max.
no, she's got you all on defense.
we got the boy, all right?
it's because she wanted you to.
every psycho takes one step too far and hangs themself.
not before a lot of innocent people get hurt.
I'll see you later.
Hey, sorry to bother you. You have a minute?
Yeah, sure.
how's it going?
I don't know, actually.
that's why I'm here. I-I'm...
I'm worried, Dr. Sweets. I-I...
this case is taking its toll on everyone.
including you?
including me, yes.
it's a very stressful situation.
I mean, you're not immune to that.
I feel like everything's fraying around the edges.
we're all searching for some piece of evidence that can put Taffet away.
but we keep coming up empty. Everyone feels manipulated by her.
and I-I should be able to pull everyone together
keep them on track.
you want to guarantee the outcome.
I wish that were possible.
but you know, we knew this was going to be an uphill battle.
but did we really believe that?
we all knew she was guilty.
so someplace, we assumed that in a just world she'd pay for what she did.
that assumes a just world, I'm afraid.
these are my people she hurt, my friends.
I should be able to do something.
I know.
Max, you didn't think I was going to follow you?
Max, is this what you want?
don't trust the system, Booth.
you miss, you compromise the case, Taffet walks.
I don't miss!
when are you gonna learn to stop messing with me, huh?
you're making a big mistake.
Tempe could die.
Yeah, come on.
he tried to kill her?
well, he had a rifle pointed right at her, so you do the math.
Why? Why would he do that?
to protect you. And a career criminal like Max
he obviously doesn't trust the legal system.
I'm sorry, Booth.
I wish he were different. - Yeah, me, too.
you know, he socked me in the eye, too.
Hey, honey.
I need you to bail me out.
What?! No, dad.
I was doing it for you.
no, I don't want you to kill people for me.
just buy me a sweater, like a regular dad.
leave her alone, Max.
booth says you're not getting out until after the trial over.
I have to go. - Whoa. I've got a bad back.
you know what the beds are like in jail.
good-bye, dad.
look, I'm sorry, Bones.
I'm sure this is the last thing you want to deal with.
Yeah.
part of me wishes he'd done it.
well, not the good part, so let's just keep our eye on the ball.
so, any news about the boy?
I'm getting an accurate recreation of the assailant from the fracture patterns on his remains, and it's a match for Taffet.
I'm putting a presentation together for court.
the kid-- he put up a good fight, huh?
there's evidence of strong resistance.
Yes. - Yeah, at least he didn't go easy.
Parker... he'd do the same thing.
probably bite her ear off and run.
he'd bite her? - Yeah.
Ten-year-olds- it's kind of their thing.
they bite.
I have to get back to the lab.
if the boy bit her, there should be some evidence on his maxilla, mandible or his teeth.
the teeth seem to have been cleaned.
Taffet probably wiped them off.
second left premolar is chipped.
there might be some trace in the abrasion, maybe some tissue from Heather Taffet.
saliva contains amylase that would have broken down any bits of tissue.
not if it were imbedded between the teeth or under the gum line.
if I don't receive the money in the numbered account within eight hours, your child will die.
this is the last...
okay, this encryption is a rolling code split band voice inversion.
individual frequencies between the clicks are inverted and recombined.
I applied software that decrypts each of the 423 separate segments until the voice becomes clear.
if I don't receive the money in the numbered account within eight hours, your child will die.
this is the last time you will hear from me.
there will be no further... - You did it, Angela.
it's Taffet.
like to see her explain away that one.
if I don't receive the money in the numbered account within eight hours, your child will die.
this is the last time you will hear from me.
there will be no further communications.
and in your expert opinion, Ms. Montenegro, whose voice is that?
it's Heather Taffet.
the frequency and vocal patterns are an exact match when compared to unencrypted recordings of her voice.
thank you.
no further questions.
that was very impressive, Ms. Montenegro.
could you share your credentials with the court?
I have a bachelor of fine arts from the University of Texas with a minor in computer science.
and I've also studied biomedical illustration at American University.
but you do not have a degree in sound engineering, is that correct?
no.
objection. Ms. Montenegro has numerous patents pending from her work in auditory forensic reconstruction.
the homeless man on my street has a patent pending for a time machine.
that doesn't mean I'm going to ask him to testify in court.
that's enough, Ms. Taffet.
do you have anything else for this witness?
Yes, your honor.
I'd like to introduce into evidence item 461b, which is a deconstruction of the same ransom tape by former FBI special Agent Graham Steele, who has a Phd in forensic auditory analysis from the University of Pennsylvania.
if I don't receive the money in the numbered account within eight hours, your child will die.
th-that isn't me.
he obviously manipulated the pitch and the timbre of the voice.
isn't that what you did? - No.
those sound waves have an underlying pattern of frequency modulation.
like a fingerprint.
whatever the technical jargon, it seems clear that anyone, even someone without any credentials, can make one voice sound like another.
Objection!
counsel is making speeches.
sustained. - I'm sorry, your honor.
no further questions.
Hey, Bones, you ready for court?
Yes. I have a video presentation which shows the victim sustained rib fractures as well as a fracture of the lateral epicondyle of the left distal...
what do you say we ease up on the scientific stuff, okay?
the science gives us the height of the assailant.
162 centimeters-- Taffet's height.
that's, that's, that's good and all, but Taffet's kind of had a field day, you know, trashing the whole technical goobledy stuff.
and the jury seems to like her for it.
but those are the facts.
it's how you present the facts that win or lose a case.
bones, the jury needs to know what that little boy went through.
I've...
I've testified before, Booth.
I'll be fine. We-we should go.
okay.
Terrence Gilroy's left greater cornu of the hyoid was compressed, indicating that the assailant strangled the young boy using only one hand
the dominant left hand, in this case.
I'd like to submit writing samples which confirm that the defendant is left-handed.
no objection, as long as it's also noted that eight percent of the general population is also left-handed.
including you, your honor.
continue.
the victim sustained a fracture of the lateral epicondyle and the shaft of the left distal humerus.
perhaps I can be clearer.
Terrence Gilroy's bones could only have been broken by someone kneeling on top of him as they pushed him into the freezer.
the radiating fracture lines show that this assailant had to be between 125 and 135 pounds
the weight of the defendant. - Objection. This is speculation.
are you questioning my qualifications?
because you will not find a more experienced or respected forensic anthropologist anywhere in the world.
so I'd appreciate not being interrupted until I finish testifying.
Dr. Brennan,
I'll make the rulings here.
overruled. Continue.
since these broken bones were caused by the assailant's knees and the chipping on the boy's kneecaps was caused by the toes of her heavy boots, we can determine the length of her shin.
and what is the significance of the shin length?
it gives us the height of the assailant, which is five feet, four inches.
the same height as the defendant.
it is clear from the circumstantial evidence and these facts that this child was attacked with vicious cruelty by Ms. Taffet.
objection.
the jury makes that determination, not the witness.
the five-foot-four assailant...
crushed the boy's chest, choked him, and finally caused him a torturous death by burying him alive.
objection. Speculation.
she can't know what the witness felt.
I was buried alive.
which makes me uniquely qualified to comment on its horror.
objection, your honor. This is grandstanding.
unless the witness has any additional facts...
sustained.
do you have any further questions for Dr. Brennan, Ms. Julian?
no, your honor.
I learned everything I need to know.
your witness.
Dr. Brennan, don't you think your trauma as a kidnapping victim prevents you from being objective?
objection. She is testifying as an expert witness, not a victim.
she brought up being buried alive, your honor.
she did, Ms. Julian.
overruled.
it's only natural that you would want to construct facts that would give you some closure and peace.
I resent your implication.
I do not let my emotions cloud my findings.
no, not intentionally, of course.
is there a question coming?
Yes. Sorry.
Dr. Brennan, you are currently seeing an FBI psychologist, are you not?
what... that has nothing to do with...
a yes or no is all that's required,
Dr. Brennan.
are you currently seeing an FBI psychologist?
Yes, but... Thank you.
no further questions. No, that has nothing to do with this case.
my findings are sound.
you may step down, Dr. Brennan. My findings are sound.
a dust mite?
so that little bug is gonna save us?
Oh, don't call it a bug.
sounds insulting.
we reexamined the boy's teeth and found it wedged between the right lateral incisor and canine.
dust mites eat dead human skin cells.
and this one's stomach sac is full.
if the boy bit Taffet, the skin cells are probably hers.
whatever's left is gonna be small, but there might be enough to give us DNA.
this is a dermatophagoides farinae.
for those of us who don't speak insect, what is that, exactly?
it's a dust mite
an insect found on clothes, but it also feeds on the cells of the person wearing those clothes.
and where was this dust mite found?
between Terrence Gilroy's teeth.
it was transferred there when the boy bit the person who kidnapped him.
and how do we know that?
the dust mite contained human female epithelial cells.
we extracted those cells and ran them through several DNA databases.
the cells belonged to Heather Taffet.
nothing further, your honor.
your witness, Ms. Taffet.
it seems that you have neglected to include a sample of the evidence that I could have tested independently.
since there were so few cells in the mite, the testing destroyed the sample, but the procedures and results are all contained in our documentation.
let me get this right.
I have access to your notes, but I can't examine the actual evidence because you destroyed it?
your honor, in California versus Trombetta, the Supreme Court ruled that the prosecution could destroy a sample to test for DNA because there was no bad faith.
bad faith?
the motives of every single person at the Jeffersonian are suspect, and now their only physical evidence is gone
if it existed at all.
I've just about had it with your snide, unsubstantiated allegations.
as have I. - That's enough, Ms. Julian.
your honor, I would like to file a motion to have this unverifiable DNA evidence dismissed.
protocol has been followed, Ms. Taffet.
it's up to the jury to decide how the evidence will figure in the outcome of this case.
your motion is denied.
did you see Taffet's face? She was completely blindsided.
okay, Caroline's closing
it's going to kill.
all right, so here we go.
that's it, huh?
are you okay, Bones?
your team just nailed Taffet.
I'm just tired.
Yeah. Yeah. It's been a... it's been a tough case.
it's not just the case.
I'm tired of all of it.
I'm tired of dealing with murders and victims and sadness and pain.
well, Bones, that's what we do.
all right? We catch the bad people, and we make the world a better place.
no, Booth. That's what you do, and somehow, - I got caught up into it. - Wait a sec.
hold on. You were dealing with dead people long before we got together.
as a researcher, an anthropologist.
that's how I can make the world a better place.
and you do. Come on.
you make the world a great place.
Hey. Cheers to that, all right?
you're just anxious.
all right? And tomorrow, when we have won, everything will be perfect.
it'll be fine.
we are here to seek justice for this ten year-old boy who was kidnapped, brutally beaten and buried alive by Heather Taffet.
Taffet was seen where this child was abducted.
she matches the size of the assailant.
she's left-handed.
her voice was discovered on the ransom tapes.
it all sounds very reasonable, doesn't it?
these so-called facts were compiled by people who themselves were victims of a vicious criminal who has not yet been caught.
they need a scapegoat.
but only Heather Taffet could have the DNA that was found in this child's mouth.
that evidence was delivered to us in death by this brave boy.
and yet, the only people who saw that dust mite, the only people who touched the alleged epithelial cells were two kidnap victims
one a known conspiracy theorist, the other a traumatized anthropologist who's currently being treated by a psychologist.
and Dr. Saroyan, who couldn't perform her job without destroying the evidence, conveniently preventing me from mounting a defense.
because she has no defense, except slandering these experts.
they have told you what Heather Taffet did to that boy.
the law is clear.
you cannot convict a person based on innuendo or groundless accusations.
I weep for that boy.
no child should suffer like that, and whoever did this...
...should never be allowed to walk among decent people again.
for that boy, for justice, you must return a verdict of...
...not guilty.
because it's clear that I am a scapegoat.
I am innocent.
thank you.
What'd I tell you, huh? Caroline nailed it in there.
Taffet was pretty convincing in there, too. - You know what, Hodgins?
you ever see the bright side in things?
you know what, Booth? You're right.
because no matter what happens in there, - I've got Angela. - Hodgins.
it's okay.
I don't care, Angie.
look, Taffet's not going to make the rules anymore.
I want our friends to know.
I want everybody to know. Okay.
angela and I are married.
what? - Ohh...
Hey, look at that, huh?
what? When, Ang? - In jail.
Hodgins wanted to wait until this was over, so everybody could be happy for us.
this isn't another pregnancy scare, is it?
no. No, this is...
this is love.
so... Why were you hiding this from us?
Oh, I was having trouble dealing with things because of the trial.
then I thought... screw it.
the jury's back.
the defendant will rise for the reading of the verdict.
in count one, the kidnapping of Terrence Gilroy, the jury finds the defendant, Heather Taffet, guilty.
order, or I will clear the court.
in count two, the murder of Terrence Gilroy, the jury finds the defendant...
guilty.
the defendant is remanded into custody until sentencing.
we are adjourned.
this isn't over.
I was out of town for a couple of days.
well, I knew Tempe had everything under control.
she didn't need me. - Uh-huh.
all right, let's just raise our glasses here.
to the squints, okay? - Come on. To Booth.
Hey! Oh, and Caroline.
hear, hear. - Hear, hear.
you know, I never doubted any of you- not for a minute.
Where'd you come from? Oh, come on.
Oh, please.
okay, let's not forget the happy couple over here.
Yes, best wishes for a successful blending of familial obligations, as well as monetary and property consolidation.
what?
I guess I'll go home.
a real bed is probably going to feel good.
I'm sorry that I, uh... that I doubted you.
sweets would say that subconsciously you wanted Booth to catch you so you and I wouldn't have to be separated again.
smart guy, that Sweets.
I love you, honey.
thanks for leaving me with the bill again.
that's nice of you. - Your fault, Booth.
my wallet got stolen in jail.
Yeah. - Bye.
can't believe they actually got hitched.
I know.
I have this sense that everything's changing, Booth.
well, not everything.
look-- we're still partners.
right?
and-and Taffet... She's... she's put away.
I mean, you're feeling good about that, right?
you almost died, Booth.
that can happen again. What if, next time, I can't get to you?
it's not going to happen again.
I envy your ability to substitute optimism for reality.
you know what? Maybe you just need to take some time off.
go to a beach.
lay in the sun.
I might need more than a little time.
don't make any decisions about your future right now.
I'm just staying...
you know when a dentist gives you anesthetic and tells you not to operate any heavy machinery or make any important decisions within 24 hours?
all right, this case was bigger than a root canal.
come on, let's just go back inside and have one more drink. Come on.
just one. - -No. I'm tired, Booth.
I-I-I'm going to go home.
all right. Come on.
let's... we'll get you in the cab.
I know, it's... it's been a long, long day.
all right, get in there, all right?
Hey. I'll see you tomorrow, all right?
mom, it's snowing!
are you jumping on your bed again, Dylan?
Yeah, 'cause it's snowing!
come make a snowman with me!
Oh, what have you done in here?
sweetie, come here.
Oh, my God!
what's wrong?
it's not the good kind of snow, honey.
cool! Dibs on the skull.
who keeps this much junk?
washington Capitals puck from the '80s.
that's classic.
victim is male... in his 40s.
that's it? That's all you got?
I mean, usually you have just a list of specifics.
I don't even understand.
I'm very distracted. - Yeah.
I bet you are with all the junk here.
no, not that.
you probably heard about the full set of interspecies hominid remains that were found in the Maluku Islands.
no, I missed that one.
Where's Mypoopoo?
Maluku. Indonesia.
anyway, this could be a crucial link in the evolutionary chain.
could be huge, I bet. But what about the 40-year-old dead guy here?
there are apparent perimortem injuries to the temporal and parietal bones, and the squamosal suture.
so, he got hit in the head, huh?
let's go see if what hit him is upstairs.
and I'm keep in' the puck- that's vintage.
I tried to get him to clean up his place.
he wouldn't answer the door, he wouldn't pick up his phone.
well, it's probably clean by now.
most of his stuff came crashing through the ceiling of the downstairs apartment.
Yeah. You know what'd be great?
if it didn't get out that Murphy died in the apartment.
makes it tougher to rent.
a big hole in the floor probably makes it less desirable, too.
Oh, not one of those guys.
what guys?
a hoarder.
this is an anthropological microcosm of this man's life.
how are we gonna find any pertinent evidence in all this crap?
all this "crap" is evidence, Booth.
Oh, this is a little slice of heaven.
cockroaches, fleas, rat droppings, bat guano.
one of those guys. - Oh, yeah.
I think I'll be happier downstairs with the dead stuff.
Oh, who could live in this stench?
put on the fan there, will ya?
sense of smell- it's destroyed after a while.
must be a survival mechanism.
in the Maluku Islands.
it's a remarkable find.
better than upstairs?
well, upstairs can't really shed light on the interspecies similarities of human evolution.
now this guy must've been dead for a long time. -Maybe not.
Hodgins found so many insects and rodents, they could've cleaned the flesh quite rapidly.
anyway, remains were found on the islands which suggest Homo floresienses may have mated with early Homo sapiens.
I've been in touch with the organizing committee.
Really?
that shouldn't cause surprise.
I'm an anthropologist.
who's been focusing on murder lately.
lately.
Hey, down below.
you might want to check this out.
did you find more remains?
not exactly.
I did, however, find 36 waffle irons.
no syrup though, so what's the point?
right.
behold.
I'm thinking cause of death might have something to do with blood loss.
there.
a place for everything, and everything in its place.
the place for this guy's flesh is on his bones, not in the buggy bellies of thousands of maggots.
dental records confirm that these are the remains of Timothy Daniel Murphy, age 48.
you'll excuse me if I'm a little bit excited.
Oh, you have a thing for hoarders, do you?
Oh, Lord, no.
they make a little nauseous, actually, but I have excellent control of my gag reflex.
there are two sets of parallel cleft wounds to the parietal and temporal bones, consistent with an attack with some kind of blade.
hacked to death- that would explain all the blood.
weren't we talking about me?
it always seems that way.
it's just...
I've been accepted to go to the Maluku Islands!
hearing loss, Ms. Wick.
that is excellent news.
wow, that did not sound sincere.
if it weren't for that letter of recommendation you wrote,
I would not have made the cut.
well, I had no idea that recommendation was for the Maluku project.
but it was.
this is amazing.
I could be referenced in research materials.
Daisy, you have to stop making that noise.
hacking suggests a crime of passion.
any blade marks on the other bones?
Dr. Brennan.
Yes, Ms. Wick is indeed very fortunate.
the Maluku anthropological team could influence scientific thought for many years.
perhaps we could return from the Maluku Islands and focus on the murder?
Disposophobics.
what's that?
it's the psychiatric term for those who hoard.
these photos indicate that the victim was a level five hoarder.
five out of ten?
no, out of five. - Well, things are usually out of ten.
well, they should be out of ten.
but level five is extremely severe.
you'd be classified as a level one.
me? - Yeah.
I've seen your office, your apartment.
you cling.
I don't cling, okay? I collect things.
it's a big difference.
okay.
level five disposophobic might also be an agoraphobic, which would limit his relationships in the outside world.
you'd be dealing with a very small pool of suspects.
why are you staring at that soldier?
that's not a soldier.
that's a full bird colonel in the U. S. Rangers.
and you know what? He's staring at me.
I hope this is coincidental.
most definitely not, Master Sergeant.
no, I'm not a master sergeant.
FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.
why'd they send you?
I told them you'd talk to me.
so far, so good.
I'm not talking to you.
this is me not talking to you.
we're losing men every day, men who don't have to die and wouldn't if you trained them.
your country needs you.- Oh, no.
don't say that word.
I served my country, Colonel.
who's that guy?
do me a favor, huh?
just head back to the murder victim's apartment, see if you can pick out any psychological clues from the garbage, okay?
Hello?
Hey.
look at you, all squinted up.
Yeah, they didn't really get me a pair that fits.
to be honest, I'm feeling kind of pinched in my... Wow.
those photographs did not lie.
Nope. - So have you found anything that points to the killer?
no, not unless he was trying to hoard the hoarder's hoard.
well, there might have been something of value in all this, right?
what, you think someone actually tried to take something from here?
how would he even know where to look?
did I just see a snake?
Thamnophis sirtalis.
it's a common garter snake.
we're on the third floor.
how does a snake get in here?
probably followed the bats, rats, mice, squirrels, and fleas.
there's also extensive termite damage, which explains why the entire floor fell into the apartment below.
four, five, six fans, and there are air fresheners hanging all over the place, so obviously there were complaints by the neighbors.
Yep, suspects. I mean, heck, wouldn't you kill him if you lived next door to this?
Whoa! Daisy said that the victim was killed by a blade.
hacked to death maybe.
this could be the murder weapon.
Yeah, well, you can put it over there with all the others.
well, maybe all of these fell on him and it was just an accident.
uh, no, no, that wouldn't explain the blood spatter.
this is going to be very difficult because everywhere you look, there's a weapon.
what's wrong? - He's back.
who's back?
Angela's father.
okay, I saw him down there.
I know you do not believe me, but I saw him.
no, I totally believe you.
the man carries a black cat bone in his back pocket.
Oh, God help me.
Yeah, of course I got complaints,
and not just from his floor,
from the whole building, from people passing by on the street.
why didn't you just evict him?
Oh, I tried and tried and tried.
look, "eviction notice for cause, to wit: health, hygiene, damage to the building.
here's a summons and a complaint, both of which Mr. Murphy ignored, and multiple filings with the health department, including mold, mildew, dust mites, vermin...
and there are snakes in the apartment, Agent Booth. Snakes.
why couldn't you have just turned off the heat?
Yeah, because that would be illegal.
he could sue me.
all this stuff must have made you pretty desperate.
Yeah, I know you think I killed Murphy to get him out of the apartment.
well, you know, the building is rent-controlled.
you know, you could have just kicked him out and charged your new tenant double.
more like quadruple, but I didn't kill him.
I went through the proper channels, which you can see- look.
these are the court filings which Mr. Murphy ignored, the last one filed three days ago.
you sure came prepared.
Yeah, well, I got to pay for the ceiling that collapsed.
I can't afford that and a lawyer.
Hi.
Hey, Bones. What are you doing here?
well, you asked me here to compare notes on the murder.
right. Yeah.
who was that soldier?
Oh, just, uh, just an old army buddy of mine.
you didn't look like buddies.
what, all of a sudden, you can tell stuff like that?
well, you've taught me to be more observant of human interaction.
I can also tell that you're reluctant to be honest about your real relationship with him.
secretary of Defense?!
they want you to go back into the Army?
as a Sergeant Major?
wait. I thought you were a Master Sergeant.
they're just trying to tempt me with a promotion, but, you know, I'm not going.
this lists your commendations.
you were really good at being a soldier.
why do they want you back?
Yeah, you know, they just think that my experience as an FBI agent and a sniper in the first Gulf War...
you could train soldiers in techniques for tracking and apprehending insurgents.
Yeah, well, I'm real happy tracking and catching murderers right here.
they say you could save lives.
course they gonna say that. It's the Army.
they say that 'cause that's what they want.
you don't think you'd save lives?
well, yeah, but I mean, anyone would in that position.
not everybody is as good as you.
I served my country, and I have a kid here.
I got responsibilities, all right?
I'm not going to go to Afghanistan, and you're not going to the Makapoopoo Islands.
right. Exactly.
you know what?
we have our jobs here, right?
Yeah.
excuse me, Dr. Brennan.
if I could just have a moment.
and I'd like to preface my statement with a caveat.
your unquestionable brilliance.
what is it, Ms. Wick?
okay, okay. In your preliminary report, you said the injuries to the temporal and parietal bones and squamosal suture were inflicted at time of death.
that's correct.
"That"-- meaning what I said, or "that" meaning what you said?
I'll read what you wrote verbatim.
that's not necessary.
there are apparent perimortem injuries to the temporal and parietal bones and the squamosal suture.
that sounds correct.
how angry would you be if it were not correct?
you mean if I were wrong?
I would never state it in those kind of bald terms.
does inaccurate sound better? No.
um, erroneous?
what have you found, Miss Wick?
you'll know instantly when I point it out.
here...
and here under 40 times magnification.
remodeling.
the wounds started to heal before the victim died.
which means we have no clear cause of death.
and even after your superlative recommendation,
I am stumped.
please conduct a histological study of the bones.
Yes, yes, of course.
may I ask why you want to do that?
there's something funny about the way these bones feel.
bones have a feel?
Yes. Touch them.
compare them kinetically to the thousands of other bones you've examined.
lighter.
my God, yes.
I wish you were coming to Maluku.
it seems odd that you'd be missing something so important.
the histological study, Ms. Wick.
the victim's apartment is like an archaeological dig.
we should be able to put together a picture of his life from his effects.
now, Hodgins is dating each pile of junk according to insect larvae, rat droppings and the yellowing of the paper.
apparently, he's been hoarding stuff for about four years.
the oldest stuff is where he fell through the ceiling.
hoarders often organize their holdings by category and value, much like one would find in a museum.
Oh, so he was curating garbage?
well, the term garbage is relative.
the only intrinsic value things have is what we give them.
it seems odd now, but in Holland, tulip bulbs were once as valuable as houses.
maybe we all overvalue things that are...
essentially worthless.
well, that was more than a comment on this case.
what's going on, Brenna.
what separates what I do here from what this man did?
so, going to Malulu is worth more?
Maluku. Yes.
the murders will never stop, but this find has real, finite value.
I'd be able to answer questions about our origin, evolutionary track.
it has implications for history, science.
listen, you're allowed to make life changes without picking a fight with your old life.
but I need a break from that life.
I'm worried all the time.
worried that Booth might get hurt on a case, and I couldn't prevent it, worried... about what our partnership means.
so you want to get away from Booth?
no. It's just...
I just need some perspective so that I can view my life with some objectivity.
have you talked to him about it?
the Army wants Booth to go to Afghanistan.
to train soldiers in the apprehension of terrorists.
is- Is he going to go?
even though he said he wasn't, it felt like he wanted to.
perhaps it's all for the best.
you two at opposite ends of the world?
I don't... don't think so.
we have work.
traditionally, hoarders have one section of possessions that has a greater value than the others.
we should be looking for that.
where did you learn how to throw a fast ball like that, huh?
you were amazing.
you taught me.
No! No. Hey, I'm not that good.
right? Yeah.
dad? - Yeah.
are you going back to being a soldier?
uh, why are you asking me that?
mom said the Army called our house, looking for you.
I'm not in the Army anymore, bub.
I'm out, okay?
I made a decision to stay with the FBI to be with you all the time.
so... it's my fault?
is what your fault?
it's my fault people are going to die?
no. That's-That's not what I meant.
I want you to save lives.
Yeah, well, I do that here.
no, here, you catch people that kill other people.
there, you would make it so people won't die.
isn't that better?
it was just a phone call, buddy.
that's all. It's over with, all right?
I got an even better idea.
what do you say we go get one of those huge, -giant, root beer floats that you love so much, huh? - Sure.
Yeah.
all right. My kid.
where are the Maluku Islands?
formerly known as the Spice Islands, indicating they smell very good.
there are earthquakes and volcanoes, and a number of venomous creatures.
what about our wedding?
we could elope in the Maluku Islands.
Oh. Okay. What then?
what would I do there?
I know this isn't easy for you, Lancelot.
but this is the biggest career opportunity I've ever had, and, like my mentor, Dr. Temperance Brennan, my career means everything to me.
everything.
for now.
and I know you're not exactly Mr. Adventure, so this has to be difficult for you.
but this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
I have to go.
for a year.
What?!
if you do decide to follow me, here's some literature on the Maluku Islands.
you were a swimmer in college.
there seem to be some lucrative opportunities in the pearl-diving trade.
hello.
Yeah. Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Hey, Booth, - I found something. - What kind of something?
it's accounting records dated four years ago.
they seem to have been neatly put away.
Hey, what if the traumatic event that turned him into a hoarder was work-related?
I mean, remember Enron? Madoff?
those guys would've loved to have killed their accountant.
I'm just saying, you never know what secret lives people have in their past.
you know what I mean?
Yeah, I do.
all right, well.
I'm going to crate these up and I'll go ahead and send 'em over to you and... you hung up, didn't you?
booth? okay- Yeah,
that wasn't a scream.
that was a yelp.
it's perfectly understandable.
this is a... crime scene, so, technically, no one should be here.
you're not afraid of me, are you?
you?
no.
good.
so now that you're family,
I'm gonna have to go ahead here and, uh, ask you for a favor.
anything for family.
dad.
I can't believe this.
tim and I worked together eight years.
the exciting world of corporate accounting.
when was the last time you saw Mr. Murphy?
he left the firm a year ago.
I haven't seen him since, but we've talked on the phone, though.
do you know anything about these accounting records?
well, there's nothing special about them.
it's simple receivables, cash receipts.
it's office supplies, mostly.
it's the kind of thing that we take to the recycling bin each quarter.
which we found in Tim Murphy's apartment.
I'm sure.
see, this is where it started.
he'd take home stuff from the office.
it was garbage, really, but he acted like it was gold or something.
the, uh, signature on these documents...
it's mine, yes.
Oh, wait, you're wondering if there's some kind of crooked accounting here?
like I might have a reason to hurt Tim?
kind of crossed my mind.
you can have any forensic accountant look at these.
they're worthless.
tim had problems, Agent Booth.
Yeah, the hoarding.
we know.
Yes.
he was agoraphobic, too.
he wouldn't leave his apartment.
that's why he lost his job.
we tried an intervention, a year ago, a bunch of us from work, but he wouldn't even let us in the apartment.
I told him he was going to smother in all that junk.
but to him, it was treasure.
about a month ago, he said me a guy offered him $50, 000 for something.
you know what it was for?
I didn't take him seriously, Agent Booth.
tim was a very sick man.
starved to death?
Yes. Notice the demineralization, particularly in the large bones.
but his place was full of food.
not good food, but basic sustenance.
the histology report shows decreased bone mass, and a marked deficiency in calcium.
he starved to death.
after being hacked? - Yes.
that could take anywhere from several days to a month.
so, after he was attacked, he was somehow immobilized?
based on insect activity,
Hodgins says he was trapped under a collapsed pile of his hoardings.
Oh, that's horrible.
Oh, my God!
I'm so excited. I just heard the news.
I could burst!
what news?
Dr. Brennan has been asked to head up the Maluku Island project!
isn't that so exciting?
I just knew they were going to ask her!
someone offered him $50, 000?
for what? - She didn't say.
just said a guy offered him 50 grand for something.
a disposophobic has a delusional regard for the value of the things he hoards.
Yeah, that's what Dr. Brennan said.
but she used anthropology speak so it sounded more science-y.
the marks on this door here.
you're saying it's from termites?
Yeah, there's termite damage all through this area.
I don't think so.
see this wood there?
that is splintered.
you're right.
so, uh, door was probably pried open.
so, a robbery, motive for murder.
hoarder has an actual treasure, somebody wants it, he won't sell, he's robbed, murdered.
Yeah, it fits.
I don't think it's possible to tell if anything got stolen from this place.
so, Daisy's going to, uh, Indonesia.
she doesn't really care if I go with her.
sweets, no offense, but you might be better off without her.
Dr. Brennan was asked to head up the expedition.
will you be better off without her?
excuse me? - Daisy told me.
no, Bones is not going anywhere.
if it's any consolation,
Angela's dad got cheated out of his car in a card game with some bikers and he wants me to steal it back.
how's that any consolation?
travails d'amour, mes amis.
the things we do for love.
great. You guys stay here and see if this guy's got anything in here that's worth 50 grand. You understand?
so, uh, I'll help you get that car back.
Really? - Yeah.
you know why?
cause I'm Mr. Adventure.
I'd rather you were Mr. Sneaky Killer Ninja Assassin, but, hey, a guy can't be picky in the sidekick market, huh?
Nope.
the Raman spectroscope uses lasers and light diffusion to measure minute changes in chemical composition.
this machine would be very useful on the Maluku Islands.
I've already suggested it to the organizers.
so you're coming?
agent Booth and I are partners.
I have to discuss it with him first.
he's probably going to go be a big hero in Afghanistan.
he says he doesn't want to go.
lance said that Booth has the psyche of a true warrior.
that it's a miracle he hasn't gone back long before this.
maybe you're holding him back the same way he's holding you back.
I shouldn't have said that.
but sometimes my mouth just has a mouth of its own.
we have to determine the precise day the victim was struck.
the day of attack, not the day of death.
Yeah.
how?
I want you to measure the amount of remodeling that occurred since the attack.
Oh, my God, that's genius.
you have to come to Maluku.
you don't want me being honored by the National Society of Anthropologists without you, do you?
remodeling, Ms. Wick.
okay, what I did was modify my mass-recognition program,
patent pending,
to scan the photographic reconstruction of the crime scene to find areas of comparatively less chaos.
awesome.
you understand what she's saying?
not in the least, but I'm so turned on by her brain.
I'd like to see her brain totally naked.
it's a terrible image.
it's just terrible.
okay, Sweets, you'll understand this.
we have a hoarder.
we also have a possible intruder.
the intruder comes in to look for something.
okay. Stacks of... Crap.
...crap grow organically, in a way.
but if someone came in and disturbed the hoarder's system, then put everything back, it would look different.
it doesn't look different.
well, it does to my program.
there.
okay, now somebody, not the victim, rearranged that pile.
okay, wait.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Where?
so you're going to go towards the window.
okay.
transmitting
window.
now turn right.
right.
you're getting warmer.
warmer.
to the left.
okay, there.
there.
does anything look strange? Anything missing?
Yes.
there are silverfish eggs here.
so something was on top of these eggs that prevented them from hatching.
I'll take some samples and figure out exactly what it was.
so, Bones, here we are.
what's all the mystery about?
I've been offered the chance to head up the Maluku Island project.
Yeah, I heard.
Daisy told Sweets and Sweets told me.
I'd like to accept.
I thought you already had.
we've been partners for five years, Booth.
I wouldn't make a decision like this without talking to you.
bones, look, you don't need my permission.
okay, it's- it's cool.
you say that, but you won't look at me.
you're the one who taught me the value of making eye contact.
so, please...?
sorry.
I just...
I don't do really good with change, I guess.
well, you're better than I am.
the pyramids are better at change than you are.
it was a joke. Hey, I was being affectionate.
will you go back to the Army?
it's what's best for me right now.
I'll only be gone for a year.
me, too.
so, hey, what's a year?
it's the time it takes the Earth to make a full revolution around the sun.
in the scheme of things.
you know, the grand scheme.
just saying, a year is just, you know...
it's not too bad.
right. - Right?
we can come back, pick up where we left off.
nothing really has to change.
no, things have to change.
you know what?
Hey, I taught you about eye contact, you taught me about evolution.
so... here's to change.
to change.
so, here's what you got so far:
a crazy hoarder got knocked down, buried alive under his own hoardings, by a robber who stole something that maybe killed bugs, then the hoarder died a little while later, then fell through the ceiling of the apartment downstairs.
it sounds better in my report.
which raises the question:
you usually add a little spice to your reports when you know your case is weak.
there was no question in there.
it was implied.
connect the dots.
okay.
aren't you a little old to go off fighting wars?
I'm not going to be fighting.
I'm just going to be training soldiers to investigate, pursue and detain.
I guess that answers my next question as to whether or not you intend to go.
what about your partner? - Oh, Bones.
she's going to Indonesia. You know what?
maybe it's time to find another, you know.
FBI guy and a forensic anthropologist.
Yes, on account you're both so replaceable.
you gotta act like a big boy on this one.
you don't want me to go?
no, you go, you stay, that's up to you.
but before you go, you clear this case, not just dress up nothing in a nice report.
I took the unhatched silverfish eggs, made a milkshake, and ran it through the mass-spec.
to find out what poisoned them?
not poisoned, but rendered infertile.
Oh, suggesting chemical agents or radiation.
radiation.
what I found were phyllosilicate minerals, along with some interesting metal oxides, very small traces of vitrified clay and Uranium 235.
so, an atomic bomb?
no, something much more interesting than that.
an atomic gnome?
basically. Yeah.
this is the Fiestaware Christmas Gnome, circa 1941.
now, the uranium was a common ingredient in the glaze on these gnomes until the Second World War, when all production of the red Fiestaware gnome was halted.
the victim claimed he possessed something worth $50, 000.
how much is the gnome worth?
50000.0
we have our motive.
now we just have to find the person who collects radioactive Hobbits.
Mr. Adventure's here, ready to kick some biker ass.
please don't explain.
you sure this is the address?
Yeah, absolutely sure.
this is pretty extreme, man.
of course, because I've got a father-in-law that plays poker with bikers.
is that his...
you mind turning him around? - Why?
why, because the gnome knows what you did?
and you don't like him staring at you with his soulful little eyes?
how do you even know that's my gnome?
we found it in your basement.
someone planted it there.
Why?
because I'm a well-known aficionado and purveyor of Fiestaware.
so, the phone records indicate that you called Mr. Murphy several times during the days leading up to his death.
someone on the Fiesta message board mentioned Murphy scored the mother lode at Alea market few years back.
he only bought it for bucks.
I was trying to see if he'd sell.
Mm-hmm. Last time you contted him was on April 29.
the day he was assaulted.
so, you have an alibi for that?
I went to talk to him.
I was willing to give him 50 grand.
I mean, he didn't even appreciate the gnome.
he was insane.
so what-- what, did you attack him with a kitchen knife or a machete?
no.
no, he saw.
I pushed the guy, and I took the gnome, that's all.
you expect him to answer, Rocky?
he already did.
he said, "Shut up and get a lawyer."
art.
smart gnome.
I need more.
come on, Caroline, we got this guy.
cause of death, means, motive, opportunity.
what caused the hacks to the skull?
we don't know.
well, he died of starvation, anyway.
the assault caused him to starve.
still manslaughter.
which will get tossed if all I have in court is this.
if it's gonna be your last case together, then do it properly.
it's not our last case.
we'll be back in a year.
tight as a drum, that's what I want.
and trust me, the way you two are running from each other, you'd better be damn sure of these little trips you're taking.
if Angela was going to the Maluku Islands, I'd go.
even if it meant you becoming a pearl diver?
Hey, even if it meant my having to listen to Daisy.
so, what, I should just go?
I should give up my career and my life and my friends and my practice, and go to Indonesia?
Hey, I'm about to risk dismemberment just to impress my scary father-in-law.
how are you going to get past the dogs?
I don't know.
how are you going to start the car?
I don't know.
how are you going to get the car through the gate?
I don't know.
how are you going to evade the angry bikers?
Oh, I haven't got a clue.
okay, good plan. What do I do?
survive and tell the story of my love.
this wall is high.
Nah. No problem.
are you okay?
what happened?
just gravity.
dogs at 3: 00.
a test? Really?
you could have done this by yourself.
Oh, sure I could, but family's about doing things together.
so, you sicced dogs on me for nothing?
well, not exactly, but we should really get going.
Wow. For real?
okay, yeah.
what do I do?
it's been my experience, if you drive at 'em, people clear out the way.
the gate!
what about the gate?
it was built to keep people out.
they are so gonna chase us.
lock the gate!
you been here all night?
wha- is it morning?
Yes.
I've been here all night.
you find anything new?
Yes. These marks weren't caused by a hatchet or a knife.
the direction of force is opposite to the direction of impact.
what would do that? - A propeller.
so, he walked into a plane?
no. A fan.
the crime scene is full of fans.
are you really leaving the Jeffersonian?
Yes. For a year.
I can provide you with a list of forensic anthropologists who can do this job.
no, Dr. Brennan.
you can provide me with a list of forensic anthropologists.
I don't know what that means.
I think we got all the fans.
I really am sorry about leaving you there.
no problem.
Mr. Adventure can take care of himself.
Plus, Daisy rewarded me handsomely for my bravery.
Oh, dude.
Yes, I am the dude.
she still going?
Yeah.
Angela's program recognized this as the o area of the apartment that was the most cared or.
these must have been an escape valve for him, ages of a life outside of here where he wasn't mented by his compulsion and agoraphobia.
we found your fingerprints on the fan.
I was in love with Tim.
when was the last time you guys were together?
over a year.
I ought if I could get him out of that apartment, maybe if t sun hit his face, he would chang and we could have a real life, so...
so I pulled him to the window, and...
and I ripped down the curtain, and he lost it.
you two fought?
well, he attacked me, so I pushed the fan at him, and I ran away.
but I didn't think I killed him.
I loved him, but...
there was nothing I could do.
well, that's that, then.
they're free to go.
you don't think this success might make them change their minds?
you know what?
you're a nice kid, but today is a good day for you to grow the hell up.
you're giving him the car?
Oh, no, honey.
I'm giving him you.
the car is just a little something to remember his new dad.
welcome to the family, son.
that is one weird, scary dude.
Yeah.
so Brennan's going to Indonesia with Daisy.
not talking about that.
well...
sweets and Daisy- they're gonna break up.
not talking about that, either.
booth is going to Afghanistan.
not gonna touch that one.
you and I will be staying here.
no. We... are not.
Oh, really?
and where are we going?
Oh, for our honeymoon?
no. For a year. Because I have no desire to break in a new forensic anthropologist and an FBI agent, do you?
no.
I do not.
well, everything's changing, huh?
yeah.- What do you think's going to happen?
not sure.
but I do know that we'll be together.
ready?
Lancelot, do you hate me?
no, Daisy. No.
do you think you' wait for me?
that would be really romantic.
I don't think so.
I don't think you should wait for me, either.
I've really enjoyed working r you, Dr. Brennan.
in fact, Dr. Saran,
I worked for you. We both know better.
okay, I made you this chart of all the poisonous reptiles and insects, what they look like, how to avoid them, and what to do if you get stung or bitten, so...
thank you, Dr. Hodgins.
I love you, too.
booth informed me that the proffering of overly solicitous advice is indicative of love.
I hope you find something that just changes the entire notion of what it means to be human.
will.
okay.
Dr. Brennan, we really have to go.
Yes.
Dr. Brennan?
Oh, my God.
sorry. Couldn't get a pass.
I had to sneak off the base to come say good-bye.
listen, Bones, you got to be really careful in that Indonesian jungle, okay?
booth, a week, you're going to a war zone.
please don't be a hero.
please just... don't be you.
one year from today, we meet at the reflecting pool on the mall.
right by the...
coffee cart.
I know.
one year from today.
are you there?
no, I'm in South Beach, working on my tan.
all right.
you need Sweets to sign your post-Afghanistan Fitness for Duty report.
did you forget? - Me?
well, generally you wear more clothing, and you've been avoiding this for weeks.
well, I couldn't sleep. And I got up at the crack of dawn.
do you always have this pronounced a release of gas in the morning?
is it that bad? - Synovial gas, that's what the cracking is.
synovial gas? What's that mean?
what do you mean,'certain point'?
booth, you've been shot and beaten, and jumped out of airplanes.
the skeletal damage alone is...
Oh, God, I'm falling apart.
you're fine.
it's your skeleton that's falling apart.
the compression fracture to your T3 alone should have incapacitated you years ago.
fractures to your metatarsals from when you were tortured.
rib pitting from when you foolishly tried to act as a human shield.
rib pitting? - And that's before we even get to your compromised ligaments, both intertransverse and interior longitudinal.
how do you have room in your brain to remember all that?
I care about you, Booth.
and the more abuse a body takes, the sooner it degenerates.
that's it? That's all you got for me?
well, it can be a good thing.
in tribes, men like you are elders.
they don't have to hunt any more.
well, I want to go hunting.
well, perhaps you'll feel better after you get your form signed.
you know I will.
agent Booth! - Doctor Brennan!
you should be at work, Ms. Wick. It is a very important day.
can you sign this?
are you serious? - Sign.
just sign and get back to your fun.
Dr. Brennan, about this morning... - What about it?
I don't want you to think that Lance and I are dating again, because we're not.
that was purely accidental intercourse.
you had intercourse accidentally?
what were you trying to do, Ms. Wick?
I was returning a book.
and your pants fell off?
door on your right.
where do you want this?
take it up on the platform. - Got it.
okay. How much of this is there?
I have no idea.
so when you said, old remains, the ship part of it just slipped your mind? - No, of course not.
this is incredible.
I can't believe this is an actual slave ship.
where did they find it? - Off the coast of Maryland.
this could shed enormous light on the slave trade.
or give me nightmares. One or the other.
Mytilus edulis. Blue mussels. Wow.
Hey, they said this was for you.
how? These people have been dead for nearly 150 years.
Yeah, well, this might help.
it's a copy of the outgoing manifest, and it lists all the slaves they were transporting to New Orleans.
there's age, and race, and degree of color.
slaves were considered property.
they were as carefully catalogued as livestock or silverware.
male child, under ten years old.130 centimeters.
the marine mussels compromised the bone, but the skull shows a mix of Negroid and Caucasoid characteristics, suggesting that he would be listed as mulatto.
got it. Polidore Nelson.
symphyseal rim well defined.
partial ectocranial suture closure.
female, 40s, five feet tall.
okay. There's only one woman that small.
over here. Now.
uh, n-not kidding, even a little bit. Dr. Hodgins.
yeah? What have you got?
that. What the hell is it?
Wow. It's some kind of organism that anchored to the bone.
interesting.
alien sea life hitchhikes in on a slave ship, and that's all you can say - 'interesting'?
I think in this context.
a temporary condition, I assure you.
all right, listen up!
pull any other bones with pink slime and bring them over here.
it's possible that 'alien' is an appropriate adjective.
I mean, we may be looking at NTI, here.
what's he talking about? - I have no idea.
NTI, as in Non-Terrestrial Intelligence? - Oh, no.
if alien life-forms were going to exist somewhere on Earth, the ocean floor would be it.
please tell me you're kidding. - Judging by weight and texture, all of the affected bones appear to belong to the same skeleton.
something is very wrong.
come on, Bones, do I really got to look at these images?
Yes. Penetrating trauma to cribriform plate and palatine bones.
okay, you mean that jaggedy-looking hole there?
this man was hooked through the mouth like a fish.
okay, got it. Thank you very much.
I just don't know how I can help you with a murdered slave, though.
they may have found him in a slave ship, but given the condition of his cartilage, this man died less than a month ago, and... this is murder.
abrasions to the pisiform.
it's likely this person was wearing manacles.
why are you working on remains from the slave ship when you know our recent murder victim has priority?
maybe we should discuss the murder victim's X-rays instead?
incomplete epiphyseal fusion.
he was at most 20 years old.
chipping on the zygomatic arch.
hairline fractures to the mental foramen, all heavily remodeled.
metaphyseal fractures to the left tibia and right ulna.
never properly set. - I've seen these before.
suggestive of child abuse?
we have to identify him.
what is taking Dr. Hodgins so long?
we are looking at what could be a clue to the origin of life itself.
the origin of life looks like a pink Chia Pet?
according to one theory, billions of years ago, organic molecules hitchhiked to Earth on comets that plummeted into our oceans, forming the seeds of life as we know it.
okay, now you've lost me.
look at this.
the organism operates like hair follicles.
anchors its root system to the bone.
you know, it's actually kind of attractive up close.
Yeah, for a mucous-excreting underwater insect.
well, let me scan the skull, and then I can build the facial reconstruction from it.
how can you compare a murder victim to ocean snot that looks like something that Barbie wore to the prom?
you compared them to a Chia Pet.
Yeah, well, that's not the same thing.
you're right, because if these guys are new, and I get to identify them, then I get to name an entire species.
Really? - Really.
so, the dead guy got caught in a fishing net, and the fishing net got caught on a slave ship?
Yeah. A net gets lost, it floats around for years.
they call it a ghost net.
Wow. Ghost net caught a ghost. That's...
something like that. - That's ironic.
okay, why are you still here?
I'm weak. I'm weak, Agent Booth.
I broke up with Daisy, but I can't keep my hands off her.
what's new? All right, you're a guy. Life goes on.
Yeah, that's the problem. We broke up, but it just goes on.
it's like she's a magnet. Should I just let it happen?
here. Pick it up.
Yes, definitely. You think?
I don't know. How am I supposed to know?
years of experience? The perspective of age?
age. How is it I went to sleep Han Solo, and I woke up Obi-Wan Kenobi?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
looks like Angela finished the victim's facial reconstruction.
Oh. There is our ghost.
he wasn't on the Missing Persons Database, but I got a hit from the FBI's facial recognition software.
Yeah, his wife lives in, uh-- what is it-- Calvert County.
he's married? - Yeah, he's got a kid and a dog and a cushy aerospace job.
no, that's not possible. He's 19, 20... 21 at most.
all right, Bones, he's 28. - No, there's no way.
booth, you really need to double-check these things.
look the battle scars are to the body, not to the brain, okay?
you're being very touchy. - I'm not being touchy.
this is Casper's driver's license.
it's the same face Angela drew right there.
okay. It's possible he had cerebral palsy.
that could retard bone development.
or you're just wrong.
I'm not wrong. - You're wrong.
Nuh-uh.
yes? - Mrs. Casper?
yes? - I'm Special Agent Booth.
this here's my partner, Dr. Brennan.
how can I help you? - You mind if we come in?
I'm actually in the middle of something right now.
it's about your husband.
we believe we found his remains off the coast of Maryland.
any reason to believe that he might have been on a boat recently?
ask him yourself. Mike?
victim got a driver's license with your name and his picture.
used it to charge up a fortune in credit card debt.
Yeah, I get it. The guy that got killed is the same guy who stole my ID, but it's got nothing to do with me. I'm not exactly a violent guy.
Mike's very easygoing.
this is a conversation between you and your credit card company, Mr. Casper.
you know how they say they record calls for quality control?
well, turns out it's true.
I'm sorry, sir, but because you failed to notify us within the...
how could I tell you when I didn't know?
you should have contacted the credit reporting agencies.
in the future, if you place a fraud alert on your credit report...
all right, you want to know what I'm going to do in the future?
I'm going to find the scum who stole my ID, and I'm going to kill him.
what did you expect me to say? They froze my cards.
our credit was ruined. That piece of dirt.
he cost us the house we were trying to buy.
if we need to have a lawyer...
we don't need a lawyer, Claire. We haven't done anything.
my husband is telling the truth. He is not a violent man.
sweets, tell them what you told me.
according to the latest clinical data, identity theft can cause serious maladaptive psychological and somatic symptoms.
Yeah. No kidding. I haven't slept in two months.
those symptoms aren't limited to insomnia.
the hell is that supposed to mean?
okay, that would be one of the maladaptive psychological symptoms.
uncontrolled rage.
how could I kill him when I didn't even know who he was?
I noticed you have a boat hitch on the back of your car. You own a boat?
Yeah. I fish. So what?
you have any big hooks on that boat?
Why? - The body was found about a mile off the coast.
I'm thinking maybe you're doing more than just fishing on that boat...
all right, I want that lawyer. Now.
Dr. Brennan really needs these.
I don't understand why you can't just pluck.
if I pluck them off one by one, it's going to take a week, Ms. Wick, so what you need to do is stop telling me how to do my job.
I don't see how this is going to hurry things up.
if I figure out what they are, I figure out how to get them off.
any more questions?
not at this moment.
Aha. Yes. It's a type of benthic worm.
see? Progress.
okay, the only way I can get DNA to ID our ID thief is by using bone marrow, but your alien organism has sucked it dry.
okay, contrary to popular rumor, it is not my alien organism.
not yet, anyway.
but I have narrowed it down to a type of benthic worm.
how can you not be able to ID a fluffy pink worm?
how many of those could there possibly be?
Oh, you'd be surprised.
how am I supposed to figure out who killed him when I can't even figure out who he is?
all I can tell from the X-rays is that he had multiple fractures that were never properly set.
so, child abuse.
he wasn't on the Missing Persons Database, so it means no one was missing him.
you have a very strange tendency to state the obvious.
if you were a kid who got the crap beat out of him over and over again, what would do you do?
you'd think about running away. Or you do run away.
but he wasn't a kid anymore, Booth. He was 19 or 20 when he died.
doesn't mean he didn't run away before.
and when a kid runs away, someone reports him missing.
a school, a neighbor. Someone.
we were looking at the wrong database.
we need to reverse the craniofacial growth patterns and run the results against the Missing Children's Database.
send him back to childhood, huh?
retain the cranial proportion, but reduce the jaw, narrow the neck, and raise the ears.
change the proportion of the head to one part facial mass to two and a quarter parts cranial mass.
decrease the size of the upper and lower jaw.
done.
you know, it's hard to believe that ten years from this, he's going to be stealing IDs and getting himself killed.
okay. That's him. We found him.
nine-year-old Liam is tonight's 'Thursday's Child' .
I like all kinds of sports, but mostly basketball, even though I'm kind of short.
but maybe I'll grow, right?
and I'm really good at math. Cause I like numbers.
if Liam can find a family, all those numbers are sure to add up to one very bright future.
okay. That sounds a little like puppy adoptions, you ask me.
well, when I was in the foster system, we used to think the kids that got on 'Thursday's Child' won the lottery.
you know? One day they're on TV, next day, a big car pulls up to take them to the suburbs.
every single time.
Yeah, well, Liam didn't get adopted.
would have saved the juvie system a whole hell of lot of time if he had.
the court unsealed his records because of the murder.
he was busted two years ago for a B&E with another foster kid by the name of Hunter Lang.
we're trying to track him down now. - Oh, why?
well, Liam testified against Hunter in exchange for a suspended sentence.
Ooh, that's not good.
rule number one: foster kids stick together.
well, was that the kind of thing a guy would kill for?
depends on the guy.
I know these kids. I'll talk to him, let you know.
has anybody else noticed this is like a giant jigsaw without the edge pieces?
one person gets killed, and it's murder.
millions get killed, and it's history.
I'm trying to just think of them as bones. It's easier.
female. Approximately 25.
right here. Hany Beaufort.
Yeah, but they're not just bones.
what does that mean?
I'm gonna need to borrow these skulls.
why does nobody seem to be working on our murder victim, Ms. Wick?
still waiting on Dr. Hodgins.
are you okay?
it's nothing, Hany.
was my great-grandmother's name.
if you two can't stay focused on the Molony case, we're going to have issues.
well, we're trying, but Hodgins is...
I got it! Thank you, Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force, a fine collection of marine biologists dedicated to making sure that if the alien ever shows up, we can jam it in an airlock and kiss it good-bye.
I lost out on the naming rights, babe.
but I'm a big boy. I can handle it.
so happy to hear that.
turns out, our little feathered friend is the Osedax mucofloris, otherwise known as the bone eating snot flower.
you've got to be kidding.
not kidding. Allow me to demonstrate.
Viola. - Oh, no.
now, the bone eating snot flower burrows into the bone like so.
it cracks through the hard shell straight down to the fatty marrow.
and then...
now, each female has maybe a dozen dwarf males inside of her.
basically, sperm holders...
Canoli? No? Anyone?
no, never again. I cannot even tell you.
can you please get to the point? - I figured out how to remove them.
you have to back me up with Dr. Brennan.
she hasn't said anything, but I know what she's thinking.
it's an emergency.
what? What am I supposed to say?
you have to explain what happened this morning.
sex is a normal part of the adult experience.
you don't need to apologize for it.
do you know what happened when I was little?
my dad and I saw these two deer going at it on the side of a hill, and I asked him what they were doing.
and he said the nice deer in back was pushing his friend up the hill.
Seriously?
and now we're those deer.
only no one's explaining that you were just pushing me uphill.
I have issues.
I had no idea.
you're happy we broke up, aren't you?
look. Dr. Brennan is not a prude.
I would suggest that she doesn't even care that we had sex, just that it was right in front of her.
that would be logical.
not that it would ever come up again anyway, - Since it was an anomaly. - Totally.
but maybe there's nothing wrong with that if it did come up.
I mean, just as long as it wasn't here. Seems reasonable.
totally reasonable.
so, the parole officer didn't have an address on Hunter Lang.
you know, it's possible he was drawn to the sea because the isolation mimics his childhood environment.
you know, you're overthinking this.
there's no such thing as overthinking.
you may think incorrectly, or inadequately or falsely, - But the notion of... - Great, got it. Got it.
okay, so, since you guys both saw the incident.
I've decided to take Agent Booth's advice.
anyway, even though Daisy and I aren't dating.
I've decided we can still enjoy each other's company, casually, once in a while.
I'm not sure why I should care.
are you planning on having sex somewhere that I will witness it?
I hope not. - Then I definitely don't care.
I'm with her. This way.
ladies! Shoving off!
Yeah, well, so much for that isolation theory,
Mr. Expert on Foster Care.
well, I've heard about these events.
they're designed to facilitate intercourse - between older women and younger men. - We got that, Bones.
hurry up, ladies! Cosmos are waiting!
we're ready to cast off! - Oh, okay. Time to board.
excuse me. We're looking for Hunter Lang.
uh, he's one of our bartenders. Nadia, they're looking for Lang.
jealous husband? - FBI.
Oh. Well, can this wait? We'll be back by 10: 00.
how about we come with you?
only if he comes, too.
that was the plan. - Done!
I'm sorry. What just happened there?
if this were the Malukus, I'd say it was some sort of virgin offering.
virgin? - Quasi virgin offering.
the male guests seem to be enjoying themselves.
Oh, come on. Are you kidding me?
look at this kid. He's barely out of diapers.
wouldn't you like to be on a boat full of nubile young women? - No.
the, uh, socially acceptable age difference is half plus eight.
come on. Everyone knows that.
they do not. If everybody knew that, Booth would know that.
okay, so you're okay with dating somebody who's 20.
sure. If she were mature. Uh-huh.
that means it would be well within the social norm for me to date a man of 24.
he's 24. Would you date him?
well, not literally.
I'm definitely getting the look here.
the look? - The precursor to sexual overtures.
let's see what you got.
mama like.
all right, ladies. You know, he's got a curfew.
he's got to be back by 12: 00, midnight. - You're going to leave me?
Yeah. - Okay. Hi.
the atmosphere is very festive. Thank you.
Oh, uh, thanks. I'm fine. No... no need. I'm working.
anthropologically speaking - Yeah?
women were attracted to older men because they could take care of them.
the world has changed. These women can take care of themselves.
Yeah, right. It's just wrong, that's all, just wrong.
Why? Because it's hard on men like you who are past their prime?
Oh, I'm not past my prime. - Well, prime is 18.
okay, maybe just a little.
Hey. Bones, there's Hunter Lang.
Oh. The posterior surface of your forearm is absolutely magnificent.
Thanks. I work out.
you can work out somewhere else. She's not interested, okay. Come on.
don't be so hasty. - Are you kidding me? Hasty.
who's the old dude? - I'm her partner.
he's my partner. - She's too old for you, and too young for you, all at the same time.
I think what he's trying to tell you is that I haven't yet reached my sexual prime.
I have. Definitely.
definitely? Give me this. Really? Right now. Okay, come on.
sweets? We're working. Put the drink down.
I'm trying. - Here have this.
Yeah, lock your lips around that, sweetheart. Come on, this way.
want me to tuck you in?
I know you had it rough, Hunter.
I was a foster kid, too.
sure you were.
how many foster homes did you live in?
11, 12. Who keeps track?
I did. Four places by the time I was six.
not something you forget.
yeah? What was your score?
score? - Supervision score.
one means doesn't need supervision, five means bring out the meds and lock him down.
makes it easy on the check-cashers, huh?
that's what we called foster parents. I was a two.
I was a four. A real pain in the ass.
great. So what was the deal with you and Liam Molony?
Oh, no, dude. No deal.
and I'm not saying that because he's dead.
he testified against you.
I got over it. Are we done yet? - No.
kids I was placed with-- we leaned on each other.
if one of those kids betrayed me, that would hurt a lot.
look, what Liam did, I was, like, whatever. You know?
we talked about it when I got out of juvie, and it's all good, no big.
so when was the last time you saw him?
labor Day. Yeah, he was, uh... he was working the cougars.
you see, most of the guys that come here, they come for the free booze, the easy sex, but not Liam.
he was smarter than that.
he used to get the extras from the old ladies, like, uh, money, gifts...
no, I'm not.
okay, on Labor Day, did you two leave together?
no, no. He must have bailed when I was cleaning up.
ask Nadia. She'd know.
why is that? - Well, he was one of her favorites.
Yeah, Liam would always show up with a car full of cubs.
Nadia would get her boy bait and then, Liam would have all the cougars he could handle.
how many would that be?
come on, man. He's 19.
was 19.
look, can I get back to work here?
listen, I'm going to go find Bones, talk to Nadia.
you get the rest of his information, all right?
Yeah.
hello there.
me?
aren't you a scrumptious little tidbit.
Oh, no, no. In case you haven't notice I really don't fit this demographic, okay?
Uh-uh. You got it all wrong, sugar.
why would I want to be with them when I could be with you?
I just needed to know what they were, and now...
I know what will eat them. Piranhas.
and they won't damage the bones?
Nope. the bubbles agitate the water and encourage them to feed.
may I ask you a personal question, Dr. Hodgins?
no. I have got a beautiful wife, a fulfilling job, and I just figured out how to remove snot flowers.
I'm gonna go ahead and savor the moment here, Ms. Wick.
perfection.
that's curious.
there are significant abrasions to the bone.
can I see that ulna?
one ulna, coming right up.
they look like kerf marks, but they don't go into the bone.
they go along the bone.
and the staining says they're definitely perimortem.
well, I'll swab 'em, and see what we got.
the abrasions are everywhere.
all along the anterior surface of the bones.
you know, I know it's one of the few areas of non-expertise, but does it look to you like somebody attacked our dead guy with a grater?
I understand. Yes.
good-bye, Ms. Wick. - So what did the lab say.
the victim was attacked by a sharp pierced object with multiple grooves.
some kind of very large grater.
hmm. Before or after getting hooked like a fish?
I have no way of knowing that until I examine the bones.
you know what? We got to find the party planner around here.
she throws a very good party.
I enjoyed my conversation.
Oh, with the zygote? - Well, he was charming.
he likes long walks on the beach, and he enjoys watching the sun set.
that's a line, Bones. They're lines.
you're what they call prime real estate around here.
well, I'm prime real estate anywhere.
never mind. Hey, Captain, you seen Nadia Blake?
uh, probably below deck.
that's some fragrant coffee you got there.
I brewed it myself. Uh, got to keep sharp.
Hey, Bones? Our guy was hooked through the mouth like a fish, right?
Uh-huh. - That fit the bill?
the shape is consistent with the damage to the palatine bone and the cribriform plate.
right. Whatever that means.
could be our murder weapon, right? Yeah.
we have to bring it back to the lab and test it for trace evidence.
Hey, Bones, could this be our grater?
well, it is if it corresponds to the abrasions on the bones.
which means Liam Molony didn't get off this boat alive.
don't! - Whoa. I got it.
stop it. - Freeze!
I mean it! Do you mind?
okay, come on, cover up.
need to ask you a few questions about Liam Molony.
do you mind if get dressed first?
you got 60 seconds.
look.
what do you got, Bones? - Hey, what happened to my 60 seconds?
maggots, most likely blowfly maggots, indicating that at some recent point, there was rotting flesh here.
okay, you, pony boy, let's go, out, come on. Here you go.
you need a key to open this lock.
bones, excuse me.
you people are crazy. - Look at that.
you said Liam was last seen on this boat?
and I'm thinking that he was killed and stashed in here until they got out far enough to dump the body.
what do you think? - I think you're right.
the last time Liam was seen alive was on one of your cruises about a month ago.
Hey, I don't keep track of the boys who go on my cruises.
my God, that would be a full-time job.
as opposed to arranging hook-ups?
for a cub, he certainly knows how to take the romance out of things.
we're not talking about him. We're talking about you.
so, middle-aged women pay you to hook up with younger guys?
no, they don't. They pay to go on my cruises.
what they do when they get off is up to them.
right. Well, one of your guests ended up fish food at the bottom of the sea.
I'm not seeing the romance in that.
and he usually does, which means, there really isn't any.
Hey, I liked Liam. He was very good for business.
Yeah, you took advantage of a kid who didn't have a mother.
you basically fed him older women.
he needed mature companionship, and my ladies needed a fresh face.
and youthful physique? - Exactly.
you know, there are plenty of guys in their 30s and 40s who have youthful physiques.
Yeah. Yeah. It's different. - Yeah.
not in a bad way, but... - Yeah, in a bad way.
you're not helping your case.
if something happened to Liam that night, I have no idea what it is.
guy was stuffed in a fish locker in a cabin that you seem to spend a lot of your quality time in.
okay, how could I put him in a locker I don't even have a key to?
who has the key? - Well, Captain Kelly.
maybe it's him you should be talking to.
do you have the results back on the maggots from the Cougar Cruise?
maggots are next on my list.
ms. Wick has already confirmed the murder weapon, everyone else is working on the slave ship, which makes you the clog in my drain, Dr. Hodgins.
still trying to figure out the trace from those bone scrapes.
it's very strange and sticky.
three primary proteins, including a trypsin-like serine protease.
this is my "what the hell are you talking about" look.
it's a waterproof marine epoxy.
glue.
why would the victim have glue on his bones?
Yeah, that's exactly what's got me stumped.
ponder it while you put the maggots in the blender.
hopefully, you can pull enough DNA to prove that Liam Molony was in that locker.
after he was dead, but before he got tossed overboard.
I'm on it.
your boat hook killed him. His name is Liam Molony.
I've seen him before, but I barely know the guy.
why would I kill him?
you tell me. You got a wife, Captain? She hook up with Molony?
conversations - Oh, please. I'd have paid him. - Would you knock it off with that?
they're from Ms. Wick and Hodgins. It appears to be urgent.
all right, just get on with it, all right? Be quick.
she doesn't really listen to you, does she?
it's really none of your business.
Dr. Hodgins blended the maggots.
they don't have remnants of human DNA.
they have mono-calcium paracaseinate.
which means? Explain. - Cheese.
What?! - The maggots ate cheese, not Molony.
okay, okay, you, that's not funny.
Yeah, it is.
look, I don't just do the horny broad cruises.
I do gourmet parties once a month.
your point is?
last week's dinner, there was a bunch of this, uh, you know, illegal Italian cheese.
I took one of them.
Oh. I see.
no, I don't. What does Italian cheese have to do with maggots?
there's a traditional Sardinian sheep milk cheese called casu marzu.
it is riddled with live insect larvae.
I told you, look, I had nothing to do with this.
all right, all right, do you remember seeing this guy on the Labor Day Cougar Cruise?
I might have seen him out on deck with a woman.
nobody goes out on deck on account of the bar's inside.
can you describe her?
well, I was, um... a little under the weather.
drunk. - A... possibility.
then how are we going to get a description?
somebody forget about lunch?
Oh, I'm ... I... How long have I been sitting here?
hours. I had a Caesar salad with a side of Ms. Wick.
we talked about Sardinian cheese, at length.
I'm so sorry, babe. I totally lost track.
no, these are amazing, Angie.
you're doing a sketch for every set of remains?
kind of feel like I have to.
you also have to eat.
I mean, you've a baby, remember?
well, yeah, but he was somebody's baby, too, and I want our baby to know that.
Oh, wow. I sound like a crazy woman, don't I?
actually, you're sounding like a mom.
Oh, crap. Already? - Yep.
then I should take that sandwich.
okay. You keep working. I'm on it.
you want a peanut butter and egg salad?
Yes. I know, pregnancy is so weird.
I love you. - I love you, too.
even the charcoal-y bits.
three separate studies suggest this is a very effective method.
it's called 'state dependent 'learning.
if we want him to remember what happened when he was drunk, - We just have to get him drunk. - Right. Is this really going to work?
memories are anchored in internal contexts.
Yeah. For example, if I had a drink,I would instantly remember Daisy and how champagne just makes her eyes sparkle.
sweets. Is he drunk enough already?
I'd say yes. - Okay, let's just focus here, all right?
labor Day cruise. Liam Molony's on the deck with a woman.
can you describe her?
he's confused. For example, if I were to describe Daisy,
I'd say she was five, five, beautiful brown hair.
Oh, for God sakes. Sweets. - What?
I remember. Her hair was red.
she kept, uh, flicking it.
booth, that sounds just like... Claire Casper.
the wife of the man whose identity Liam stole.
get his keys. - Why?
we got to go solve a murder.
just give him two aspirin and put him in a cab, all right?
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
we've got witnesses, and they all put you on the Labor Day Cougar Cruise.
big whoop. I go on a lot of party cruises. They're a fun night out.
fun night out with Liam Molony?
all right. You really want me to say this?
Liam and I hooked up a few months ago.
he used to come by the house when Mike was at work.
Oh, okay. So when Mike's ID got stolen, you realized that it was Liam.
could've been real easy for him. All he had to do was grab some mail.
that must have really pissed you off.
you think I cared? That boy went like a hot little pipe.
Oh, you definitely cared, cause your whole little world was about to come crumbling down.
you went on that cruise, looking for him, didn't you?
what did he say?
threaten to tell your husband about the affair?
I didn't kill Liam.
and there's nothing you can do to prove different.
Hey. We're almost wrapped up.
Yeah. Booth called.
he thinks Claire Casper did it, but there's no evidence to tie her to the crime.
no, I was actually... I was talking about the Amalia Rose.
the remains have been identified, and they're moving them into the exhibit.
the press conference is tomorrow.
great.
not that this is any of my business, but, um, I sort of thought that you'd be more interested.
interested? Is that what I'm supposed to be?
I just thought... - That because I'm black, I should be all over this.
I already know what happened.
my family were property, along with about 15 million other Africans.
they were traded like cattle, and they died like cattle.
and I am trying really hard not to let those bones out there get to me.
I'm sorry, Cam. I should have been more sensitive.
it's fine. It's all good.
Hey, so, new developments. Am I interrupting?
no. Uh, What's going on?
I ran a couple more tests, and the sticky stuff on the bone abrasions wasn't marine epoxy, it's barnacle secretion.
I think I know what happened.
now, imagine this platform is the party boat, and I am Liam Molony.
and I'm Claire Casper, sexually predatory suburban housewife.
right. Okay. So... Molony and Claire, they struggle.
now, Molony, he's strong.
we know that from the bone attachments.
but Claire, she's got rage on her side.
and I shove him overboard.
don't worry. We thought this through.
Molony... he tries to climb back onboard, scraping himself on the barnacles.
but Claire-- she grabs the boat hook.
and stabs him with it, straight through the mouth.
the hook tore through his palate, into the frontal lobe, fracturing his front teeth as it was removed.
what's wrong?
there may be evidence in the barnacles.
and that is why I sent the techs out to the marina to check the boat.
barnacles grow at a prescribed rate.
we dated these little ones back to the night Liam Molony disappeared.
he tried to climb back up the side of the hull.
Yeah, and these baby barnacles grew in their place.
DNA's back from the blood we found under those barnacles.
there's two types.
one is consistent with Liam Molony.
the other's a match for Claire Casper.
she must have gotten cut when they struggled.
booth wanted evidence. Looks like we got it.
a jury's going to believe this, Claire. We got you.
it was an accident. I...
I told Liam I knew what he did.
we started fighting.
my glass broke and I got cut.
I looked down and saw blood, and I got so mad, I shoved him.
he went over. - Into the ocean.
I grabbed the boat hook to get him. I was going to pull him out.
then what happened?
I never thought of myself as old until then.
just like a fish.
I wanted him to die, Agent Booth, but I...
I didn't want to kill him.
here's the thing, and as much as it pains me to say...
I don't like casual sex. - You don't?
I mean I like sex. I love sex.
okay? I just...
I don't only want to spend time with you 'cause I'm getting my freak on.
but I like giving you the freak.
if you want to keep seeing me, we need to have substantive conversation and shared interests.
well, that should be easy. I mean, we have lots in common.
okay. Like what?
we both love Indian food.
can't stand it. Only ate it for you.
Really? - Uh-huh. What about travel?
since the Malukus, I'm totally over it.
hiking? - Hate it.
dogs? I love dogs.
I'm allergic.
remember that time when you had the flu and we stayed in bed and watched the Saved by the Bell marathon?
Yeah, and we decided you're just like Jessie, cause she's so smart and ambitious, right?
and you were like Screech 'cause he was the geeky genius.
but they never hooked up. - Which, they totally should have.
right? 'Cause they had more in common than they realized.
we could watch it again.
I have issues with the last season.
me, too!
forgotten until today.
they will be buried at the Great Oak Cemetery in Maryland, but their names and faces will live on here, in the Jeffersonian.
ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to present the victims of the Amalia Rose.
Jim, no last name.
Rebecca, no last name.
Eliza, no last name.
Franklin, no last name.
she's 6. 5 centimeters. It should be a matter of minutes.
Oh, I should go. I don't think we're gonna make dinner.
she's almost done.
it's... really late.
right. - And I've been waiting for five hours.
we can go to breakfast.
there's a place around the corner, makes the best French toast.
I really have to go.
you'll miss the miracle of birth.
death's calling on the other line.
uh, coffee later today? 3:00?
think you can get away?
I will. I'll clear the afternoon.
okay.
get this baby out of me...!
Neechy, uh, neechy... what?
Nixtamalization.
the traditional Aztec method used to prepare kernels for consumption.
maize was a very important aspect of Mesoamerican life.
where are we?
I have no idea.
I should have brought the GPS. - Or a periscope.
here. You can be the periscope.
no, thanks.
you want to be the guy holding the periscope?
what do you see?
everything.
this height is extremely advantageous.
see the crime scene?
Yes. The crime scene is over there.
here they come.
I hear Cam!
there you are.
I... I thought we were lost.
this crime scene is very remote.
and the corn is creepy.
it is, right? For a vegetable. Or is it a grain?
maize is actually a grass.
why are you so dressed up?
paul and I were headed to dinner when one of his patients went into labor and one of mine turned up in a cornfield.
Ooh, bummer.
nobody's touched it. I was waiting for you.
state of decomposition and the height of the plants beneath the body suggest some passage of time.
well, what do they say about corn,"Knee high by the Fourth of July"?
how would you know?
I did Oklahoma! in high school.
with the dry weather we've been having, I'd say he's been dead maybe four weeks?
victim is male, early 40s.
and judging by his clothes, he was here to work.
any ideas about cause of death?
Oh... there we go.
this is a homicide.
evidence of a bullet wound to the sternum, gladiolus and the true ribs.
right.
see a bullet in there? - No.
I-I don't see the exit wound clearly.
looks like the muzzle of the gun was held in intermediate proximity, close to the chest.
there's got to be a bullet around here somewhere.
uh, that was thunder.
there's lots to do.
let's pull some soil samples and get out of these guys' way.
are you prepared to remove the body?
I got the bag right here.
forget about the bag-- you need a tarp. Now. This is about to turn into Woodstock.
Oh, uh, which way is the car?
I have no idea. We didn't anticipate rain.
Yeah, you never know.
let's cover him up before he's soup.
you got off easy, kid.
mother Nature cleaned these bones.
she did a crappy job.
she can hear you.
we bagged the body before the hard stuff came down, but five minutes later, it was a mud bath.
man, why do I always miss the fun?
well, something has been snacking on this guy-- a rodent with large incisors.
muskrats.
the farmer who owns the land said he's been having a problem.
well, did he, by any chance, shoot at them?
I don't think so.
he has severe rheumatoid arthritis.
look at this, Dr. Saroyan.
I see a tangential entry wound, but no radiating fractures.
it's consistent with the close-range shot.
what's the diameter?
15. 89.
which could be anything between a 9mm and a 38.
has Agent Booth found the bullet?
last I heard, FBI has a team out looking.
I'll... check on the progress.
not yet" is not an answer, all right?
so just keep looking. Right.
what are you doing here? - Any luck with the bullet?
Aw, you know. They're changing the expression from, uh, "needle in a haystack" to "bullet in a cornfield.
well, let me know as soon as you can.
ballistics gets backed up this time of year.
right.
you know what it means if we don't find it.
the guy wasn't killed in the cornfield.
that's it.
Yeah, so, why are you here, again?
to be honest, Seeley, I... I want your opinion about something personal.
this is about your boyfriend.
uh, Paul's not my boyfriend.
we just see each other once in a while.
and every time we do, somebody's water breaks and he's got to go.
that's not his fault.
he shares this practice with six doctors.
he chooses to be this busy.
you like this guy?
okay, look, then it's all about communication.
you just got to give this guy a chance.
but I feel like I have. How many chances does he deserve?
nine. - That's cats.
applies to men and cats.
all right, so listen. All I'm saying is you deserve someone great, and if you feel as though this guy is the one, then don't let him get away.
this doesn't make any sense.
a clayshoveler's fracture at the C-7 indicates a life of hard labor,
he baled hay and drove a tractor.
but look at the muscle attachments.
they're a result of repetitive motion?
Yes.
and there appear to be stress fractures forming at the radiocarpal joints.
it's as if this man spent a great deal of time supporting his weight on his hands while engaging in a repetitive motion.
I get it.
this motion would be reminiscent of a primate having intercourse.
we are looking for a horny farmer. Yes, we are.
it's Booth. Brennan.
ed Samuel, 41.
he rents farm equipment in the area where the body was found.
he went missing about a month ago. He was wearing a plaid shirt, blue jeans...
that sounds consistent.
we'll need to confirm with dental records.
ask if he was horny.
Oh, wa... was he promiscuous?
I don't know.
his wife Maryanne's at home right now. Okay?
I'm going to come pick you up. - Okay.
what difference does it make if he was promiscuous?
the evidence seems to indicate that the victim spent a lot of time copulating.
these are my children and my, um, father, Dan; and my sisters, Beth and Carol.
how do you do?
FBI Special Agent Booth. This here is my partner, Dr. Temperance Brennan.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
thank you. - And thank you for coming.
Hey, kids, let's go to the park, huh?
let's go.
can we? - Oh, sure.
do you mind if my sisters stay?
of course not.
so... tell about your husband Ed.
uh, well, he was raised right here in town.
he always farmed his parents' land.
and when I was pregnant with our first son, he started the equipment-rental business, to help make ends meet.
how many children do you have?
eleven.
we always wanted a big family.
ed must have enjoyed having sex with a pregnant partner.
I can tell how much time he spent copulating.
so the night that Ed disappeared...?
it was... just any other night.
we were here, making dinner with the kids, and, um... he just never came home.
eventually, we called the police.
any reason to believe why somebody would wa to hurt your husband?
no.
everybody loved Ed.
so did you or your husband own a gun?
Yes, we do.
uh... Ed liked to keep one for protection.
it's in the bedroom.
I can show you to the bedroom.
this way.
hey... Check out this Solanum tuberosum.
why are you walking like that? - Like what?
slow. You usually walk fast.
just thinking.
Ah, that's her pensive walk.
care to share what you're pensing about?
Oh... nothing.
life.
you have a life?
no... Dr. Hodgins, I don't.
is everything okay?
everything's fine.
what's this about potato particulates in our cornfield?
uh, not in the cornfield.
I found them in the chest wound.
lots of them.
uh, and look what I found on his shirt.
they're called, uh,"anthers.
it's the pollen-bearing part of certain flower stamens.
cornflower or potato flower?
neither. We're talking about a whole other plant entirely.
this victim, he was like a full-blown salad of plant particulates.
then you should be a happy man.
there is no one happier.
see, Dr. Saroyan, it's okay. No one has a life around here.
are any of the children the result of multiple birth?
no.
they're congenitally deformed.
why would you say such a thing?
cranial proportion indicates that all of these subjects are less than 18 months old, divided by average human gestation...
they have small heads. Bones.
they look very cooperative in that picture.
I mean, someone takes a picture of my kid, he hits them.
the children are a blessing.
here's his gun. He doesn't use it. It's just for protection.
does he have any bullets?
I don't see any, but I will go to the closet in the other room and check.
great.
the small heads! - They're statistically impossible.
you don't just say things... - Who's that?
Oh, it's Cam. Hey, what's up?
if it helps, Hodgins found potato particulates in the wound.
Oh, they used a potato as a silencer.
is there a pillow shortage in Virginia?
I don't know; it's a country thing-- shoot through a potato. I got to go.
this is all we've got.
all right, thanks.
uh, do you know anyone who farms potatoes, by any chance?
I suppose some people do.
um, our family photos are private.
not during a murder case.
I understand your secrecy.
you must face great stigma in the United States.
bones, we should go. - I understand the practicality.
I studied a similar tribe in Papua New Guinea.
I take it back. Those children, are not deformed, Booth.
bones. - They...
let's just-- I'm sorry-- let's go.
they have three different mothers.
look... Ed and Maryann: Ed and Beth.
ed was married to both of you?
and Carol.
these women aren't just sisters... they're sister-wives.
american polygamy is primarily limited to one tradition.
uh, these people are fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints.
Mormons.
no, they're not at all sanctioned by the mainstream Church.
mormons abandoned the practice of plural marriage a long time ago.
how do you know about this, Sweets?
college paper.
no. Television.
the mainstream media depicts plural marriage as if it were the, uh, proverbial bug in a jar.
that's just pretty strange if you ask me.
was Ed Samuel legally married to all three sisters?
one.
the other two were married in a religious ceremony.
that's how he stayed out of jail.
then it's merely a personal choice.
polygamy is a viable response to many socioeconomic conditions.
Really? How so?
well, I can see why a man might fantasize... - Sweets.
didn't ask you. Bones, go ahead. How so?
for instance, in ancient China, the male-to-female ratio is skewed.
we're talking about Virginia here. Okay? Ratio is just fine.
swingers. These guys were swingers.
swingers are, by definition, couples, who with permission of...
just stop, all rightI'm saying is that, you know, multiple marriages-- great motive for murder.
you're applying your own bias.
no. Actually, I agree with Agent Booth on this one.
thank you. - You're welcome.
polygamy may make sense anthropologically, but jealousy is a very powerful emotion.
free love taught us one thing: open relationships don't necessarily work.
I mean, did these women claim to be happy?
they said they were.
did they have alibis?
they were at home, shouldering their economic burden communally.
right. Clipping coupons.
you know what I should do? I should call the sisters' dad, Dan Lambertt.
how could he be cool with this?
that's a good place to start.
I'm right behind you. - Thanks.
cam. - What's up?
we still on for that coffee?
I can't. I'm sorry. I hate to jerk you around like this.
no, I get it.
I told this woman to stay off the trampoline.
you do what you got to do.
we've all got responsibilities.
all right, listen.
uh, when I say tomorrow, I mean tomorrow. I promise.
talk to you then. Safe delivery.
that gun looks nice.
Dr. Lidner, she's crowning.
honestly... I thought my girls were out of their minds.
however, you spoke with Ed on a regular basis for years.
ed and Maryann met at church, when they were teenagers.
his family, our family-- all of us attended the same place.
right, at, uh, let's see, that Mormon church up at Balding?
I thought he was good for her.
I couldn't have been happier when they got married.
then a few years later, he comes to me wants to take Beth as his second wife in some ceremony, with Maryann standing right there.
says it was Maryann's idea.
what did you say?
I was shocked.
I mean, I... the girls had always been close, but like this?
they said it was what they wanted.
so you just went along with it.
it's not my business to make life harder on my kids.
where were you the night that Ed disappeared?
at work.
I'm retired, but I still take some shifts at the hardware store.
you know, your daughters; they haven't really been forthcoming about their situation.
I'm sure they weren't.
they don't have it easy around here, Agent Booth.
my girls don't deserve this.
neither did Ed.
no one should have had a problem.
who had a problem?
a lot of people. You talk to Pete Mill?
who's Pete Mill?
he owns that pecan orchard up the road.
a month ago, someone scratched "plig" on the hood of Beth's car and bashed out the windshield.
that's, uh, derogatory for "polygamist." - Right.
you think he's the one who did this?
I know he did.
so, Mr. Lambertt, you... you own any guns?
Yeah. A few for hunting.
you can take 'em. Take 'em all.
Oh, that poor man.
three... - And they're sisters.
I heard you the first time.
but they don't engage in sexual intercourse in a group setting.
rather, they keep a strict calendar.
why would one man even want three wives?
well, with three wives, he can produce 11 children in eight years.
I guess, more people to do dishes.
what is she doing?
what are you doing?
shooting a gun into this big tank.
it's homicide season.
the FBI ballistics lab gets all backed up.
but you can't run ballistics. We haven't recovered the bullet yet.
well, when they do, I'll be ready.
is it safe to shoot in the lab?
probably not.
uh, can you stand behind the line?
can I do it?
no. You go look at some bones. Take some ear protection with you.
this gun is mine.
fire in the hole!
have you made any progress with the manble?
I can hear you.
what's wrong with Dr. Saroyan?
uh, it's likely she's experiencing sexual frustration...
but Cam is a very... private person.
the mandible... I don't know what caused the condition, but I've ruled out cancer and pesticides.
I also... I also found a perimortem bruise on the pelvis, specifically the frontal curve of the right iliac crest.
and look at this.
there are particulates embedded in the exit wound.
look at the posterior aspect of the seventh rib.
a result of blowback.
the bullet struck a hard surface upon exit, causing the particulates to...propel backward.
that's correct.
who let Cam shoot a gun?
the Second Amendment.
what's that?
that is the answer to our anthers.
behold the catkin.
it's a cylindrical bud cluster found on several flowering plants;
in this case, the Carya illinoinensis, otherwise known as the pecan tree.
wait. This... flower is from a pecan tree?
certainly is.
Hey, Pete Mill, right?
you own Mill's Pecans; an orchard near the field where the body was found?
I don't know anything about that.
you don't know if you farm pecans?
I farm pecans.
I don't know nothing about no dead body.
it's a small community.
can't deny that you knew the victim.
he wasn't a friend or nothing.
I just knew him.
but you didn't like him.
you know what his deal was, right?
he was a polygamist. - Pervert, I call it!
he was living in sin, defying the laws of nature.
and it was your job to let him know, right?
tell me about the car.
what car?
you scratched a word on the hood of Beth Samuel's car-- "P-L-I-G.
that's it. I need a lawyer.
work with me here, Pete. Nobody cares that you keyed a car, but you don't want to go down for murder if you didn't do it.
son, I believe in family values.
marrying three girls from the same family ain't right.
Amen. Did you kill him?
the sanctity of the institution of marriage is everyone's business.
marriage should be between one man and one woman; not two boys, not a cow and a frog, or a...
actually, you may need that lawyer.
do you own any guns, Mr. Mill?
Yeah. An old . 22.
and a new . 22.
granddad's revolver, new shotgun, old shotguns, rifles, pistols, you name it.
I sent over the guns from all of our suspects.
I see. Over there, guys.
find the bullet yet? - Nope.
it's officially not there.
so... we know the body was moved and we have no idea where he was killed.
that's right. - Okay.
I'll get to work.
I've got nothing else to do tonight.
Oh, what? You don't have a date with the doc?
eh, he cancelled this afternoon. I'm starting to feel like a sap.
Aw, come on. You know you've been called a lot of things, but sappy is definitely not one of them.
Hey, Seeley, I was thinking... I have a theory about this case.
all right, go ahead. Shoot.
why do people kill other people?
money, jealousy, love... - Bingo.
okay, look. There's no way that all three women were okay being in King Ed's harem.
uh... how do you know? - I just know.
I don't have to tell you about plural marriage and the Bible.
okay, that is the Old Testament.
both Testaments reference it without fanfare. It was a given.
you know what? That was a long time ago.
and no need to take it so literally.
you believe that Jesus walked on water.
we really don't need to have this argument right now.
who are you to choose what should be taken literally in a sacred text?!
you can't have it both ways.
exactly my point-- you pick a wife and you go with it.
history suggests that monogamy would only guarantee extinction, not happiness.
right. Well, history is wrong; that's all I can say.
booth.
right.
thank you.
you're about to say something that supports your argument.
well, Maryanne Samuels, better known as contestant number one, filed for divorce from her husband six weeks ago.
how is that for happiness?
I know I should have told you.
right. Well, you do know that it's illegal to withhold information during the course of a Federal investigation. Makes you look really guilty.
I'm sorry. I haven't even been honest with my sisters about the divorce.
Really?! You don't say,'cause, you know, I thought you shared everything.
not yet. I... didn't want them to be hurt.
I... Ed was still trying to talk me out of it.
okay, you do realize this looks, more and more, like a motive for murder.
well, it's not.
I know it's hard for you to understand why we live the way we do.
it is our religious belief.
you're right. You're absolutely right. I don't understand.
I just wanted to look after my sisters.
I didn't mind sharing Ed, as long as it was with them.
right. You cited irreconcilable differences. Can you be more specific?
what, that you wanted to sleep with, uh, Ed on Wednesdays and Fridays instead of, uh,Tuesdays and Thursdays?
No!
ed was having an affair.
what are those?
they're particulates from the blowback that were lodged in the victim after he was shot.
that wasn't clear at all, was it?
uh, I stopped listening.
okay. After he was shot, right, the bullet went through him, and then it hit the wall, or something, and then the debris blew back and lodged into his spine.
that any clearer?
I don't know, honey. I stopped listening.
the baby was moving.
man, I am so jealous that I don't get to feel him yet.
Oh, don't be upset.
it's only the most amazing thing in the world.
you're so cruel.
you know, with this baby coming, we could, uh... we could really use another wife.
Really?
you want me to marry another woman?
no, not you.
me. I could use the help.
I'm gonna be like a 24-hour restaurant.
I will be your slave. You know that.
would you want another wife?
truth?
Oh, I'm not sure.
if I could marry you twice, I would do it in a heartbeat.
I wish we could have sex at work.
Really?
it's this lab coat, isn't it?
well, they're organic.
the particulates-- it's some kind of plant.
well, he was found in a cornfield.
Yes, but this is not corn.
this baby's going to be so proud of me.
your phone is ringing.
it's Paul.
Oh, hot doctor Paul?
that's the one.
what did he do?
nothing.
we're just two ships passing in the night.
I don't think it's going to work out.
he must have done something.
no, he didn't.
okay. He hasn't kept a date in three weeks.
what is his excuse?
women in labor.
no. It's a good excuse-- don't get me wrong-- but I'm...
I'm just starting to wonder how much he cares for me.
I mean, best case scenario, he's a workaholic.
well, then it's a match made in heaven.
if we ever saw each other.
I get it.
you're blowing him off so he'll come crawling back.
uh, no, that's not it at all.
Yes, it is.
I'm all for it.
I'm way too old to play that game.
this isn't a game.
you're Cam. You don't wait around.
go ahead and make your plans, and if they don't include him, then he'll catch up.
booth says I need to communicate.
there's more than one way to communicate.
do you have a better strategy?
so, due to the presence of blowback in and around the wound, we know that the bullet came into contact with a hard object upon exit.
for instance, the wall?
well, we don't know that. But let's say the wall.
is that a plausible scenario?
I think so.
do we have any more information on the assailant?
booth thinks it may be the victim's first wife.
is the representation of the victim's height accurate?
it seems Maryann may be too short to hold the gun comfortably.
no, the representation is accurate.
I cracked this nut wide open.
how?
the particulates we found in the blowback are actually pecan.
we already know the victim came into contact with the flower of that same plant.
Yes, but I'm not talking about an ordinary pecan.
this pecan had undergone a unique digestive process rendering it into, for lack of a better word, a rock.
digested pecan?
what animal turns pecans into rocks?
good question.
when we find the answer, there's where Booth will find his magic bullet, and thus, the scene of the crime.
let's see what happens when I put him on the floor.
why did you do that?
well, what digested pecan would be on the wall?
good point.
it's far more likely for feces to be on the floor.
there you are.
I found out why our victim had a mush mouth.
isotope results indicate high levels of radium.
that's a bone-seeking isotope.
someone was likely trying to poison Ed Samuel.
he was poisoned?
it makes sense.
his teeth and jaw clearly suffered exposure over time.
he was drinking it.
that's the number one way that wives off their husbands.
it is? - Seems like it is.
but ultimately, Ed Samuel was shot.
after she got tired of waiting around for him to keel over on the dining room table.
which one do you think it was?
I don't think the wives would have access to radium salt.
who would?
the use of radium salt is limited to scientific experimentation.
right. Would a college laboratory have it?
it's possible. - Possible.
cause Ed Samuel was dating a grad student in his spare time.
how did you meet Ed Samuel?
I tutor his son Jasper in Chemistry.
ed brought him to the lab on campus.
were you aware Jasper had three mommies?
no.
I thought Maryann was his mother.
she picked him up once in a while.
so you slept with her husband?
Yeah.
I mean, I know it was wrong, but really, it was no biggie.
no biggie?
what do you want? I'm 22.
he bought me a really nice used convertible.
how did you find out about Beth and Carol?
when they showed up one night while I was finishing up an assignment for the next day.
all three of them.
but Maryann did all the talking.
what did she say?
she was calling me a whore and said, like, all this scary Bible stuff.
I ran out.
now, do you have something called, uh, radium salt in your lab?
we used to.
we studied its use as a fertilizer.
it has to be kept in a special box lined with metal, marked "radioactive.
what happened to it?
I don't know. I went to look for it the other day and it was gone.
I-I should have called the cops.
okay, so does anyone want to speak up?
that's not ours. At least it's not mine. - No, it's not mine, either.
someone is trying to frame us.
I don't know anything about it.
well, we will soon.
they're testing for fingerprints right now.
and since you all live here, you can all be held legally responsible.
it's mine. Okay? It-It's mine.
believe me, Agent Booth. I did this alone.
Maryann and Beth knew nothing about it.
what were you thinking?
she has always been a troublemaker.
I thought inviting her into the family would help.
if you were having problems, there are other ways.
like divorcing him secretly?
Really? Now the truth comes out.
who was getting a divorce?
I was.
I-I didn't want to ruin your lives.
I was going to tell you. - No, you weren't.
I saw the paperwork in your trash two weeks ago.
what were you doing in my bathroom? - I needed something.
ladies. Please.
no one is allowed in anyone else's bathroom.
I admit, it is fascinating to watch a tight-knit group fracture under pressure.
that and they're dangerous. - Right.
okay. Ladies. Everybody, please. Calm down.
obviously, you've all been under an enormous amount of stress.
tell us exactly what circumstances lead you to poison your husband.
we went to talk to that Heather Lakefish.
and I saw the radium salt right there.
but I didn't want to kill him.
I just wanted more time with him.
I thought you kept a strict schedule to avoid complications.
we do, but we have different responsibilities, and when Ed is sick, he stays with me.
I went to nursing school.
Oh, then you know that poisoning leads to death.
I... I didn't give him that much.
just enough so I could see him once in a while.
we never got to be alone.
they're always hovering.
they're jealous.
you are so ungrateful.
well, at least she tells the truth.
okay, ladies. We're done, all right?
Carol, you're being booked attempted murder.
I, uh, see it's not a good time.
Paul, what are you doing here?
you weren't answering my calls.
then again, maybe you didn't hear them.
I got your message.
messages. I should have called.
excuse me.
uh, Dr. Saroyan, Dr. Hodgins is beginning the feces project, if you'd like to join.
how can you say no?
it can wait.
and can you come with me?
um, I know why you're angry.
no, I'm not angry.
okay, maybe a little.
I have too many patients and they take up too much of my time.
no, you're good with your patients.
and it's not just you.
we're both strapped to a schedule.
I just don't know where that leaves us.
Hey, you don't want to start catching babies, do you?
all right, then we'll come over here and shoot guns.
Oh, I wish it were that easy.
we could make it easy.
cam, the reason I came here at an incredibly inconvenient time for both of us is because I had to say this.
I care about my job, but I'm starting to realize I care more about you.
I love being with you, Cam.
I mean, you're brilliant and gorgeous, and I think about you all the time.
I-I... don't know what to say.
I don't want anything to get in the way of this relationship. Okay?
not even the career I've worked for my entire life.
you have responsibilities.
so do you.
but I have to prioritize, and so do you.
angela said we're both workaholics.
mother's intuition kicking in. She's right.
that's why I lied to my patients.
I told everyone I'm going to Thailand for my sister's wedding.
I made reservations for dinner tonight at the Founding Fathers.
and I bought you a scarf.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I have a murder to solve.
then stand me up.
I'll feel better. We'll be even.
8: 00, I'll be at the bar.
no, no. Really, I can't, Paul.
but I-I will call you next week. I promise.
so that's a yes?
see you at 8: 00.
what are you doing?
I'm watching a live feed.
Peter Mill distributes his surplus pecan crop as food for livestock through a local co-op.
for sheep, pigs and... and ostrich?
good God, man, did you go to college?
is that an emu? - Yeah, that's better.
so you feed them pecans, and then you plan to retrieve their, uh...
feces. - Right.
to see which animal's excrement best matches the evidence found in the blowback.
correct.
care to take a field trip this afternoon?
I got two shovels.
Oh, I-I can't. I... I'm busy, you know.
Really? Busy, huh?
Yeah. Just...
too busy to go through feces?
this moron was poisoned and shot.
I'm surprised he wasn't stabbed and burned up, too.
okay, how about nitwit or doofus?
what was that? What's going on?
Oh, adaptive cruise control.
when the Prius senses the car ahead is too close, it warns you and slows down.
so the car is smarter than our victim.
anthropologically, the victim...
no, no, no, no. No more anthropology. All right?
you live with three women-- it's like a breeding ground for revenge and violence.
you want to know why?
because human beings are more complex than anthropological tropes.
what might work for one culture is an anathema to another.
wait, are you agreeing with me?
no.
I'm merely stating what is... currently accepted.
you're agreeing with me. You are.
only in so far as the victim should have realized how complicated his relationships would become in our present culture.
in that case, and in that case only, he-he was a... he was a nitwit.
he was a nitwit.
did you just laugh?
I did. I think I did. I'm sorry.
bones. - It's wrong, because a man is dead.
that's right. You're right, it's sad.
Yeah.
he was a bonehead.
I like that term.
it's very appropriate for my profession.
right. Right, Bones? Bonehead. - Bone. Get it?
how about this-- ass hat?
the guy was a real ass hat.
Oh, we're terrible. - I won't tell if you don't.
ass hat.
right. Right. Okay, right, all right.
so is Hodgins any closer to finding out about the pecan poop?
he's narrowing it down.
it will tell us where he was killed before he was moved to the cornfield.
poisoned, shot, and rolled in poo-poo.
twit. - Chowder head.
numbskull.
we really are terrible. - We're terrible.
we're really terrible. - We're bad.
doofus.
they've arrested one of Ed Samuel's sister-wives.
I heard.
but she wasn't trying to kill him?
only maim him.
we still don't know the identity of the shooter.
what do you think of this?
angela asked me to take a look.
but something's not right.
did she check the figures pertaining to the bullet's angle and velocity?
they're accurate.
and placing the assailant directly over the victim is consistent with the blowback and the direction of the beveling.
true.
but why wouldn't the victim get back up?
it takes two hands to shoot someone through a potato.
I see your point.
the kinesiology is questionable.
I'll need you to gather all of the possible weapons and measure the length of each barrel immediately.
then prepare full ballistics reports.
I don't... I don't think so.
why not?
y... You don't need me tonight.
of course I do.
but it can wait, can't it?
I... suppose.
it's important, but... - So is... my love life.
I-I'm... gonna go home and get ready for a date.
see you tomorrow.
Where's she going?
to have sex with Dr. Lidner.
good for Dr. Saroyan.
I have an idea.
please lie down.
what?
Oh, one of these.
okay.
ed Samuel was a fairly large man.
what would the killer have to do to subdue him?
the perimortum bruise on the iliac crest!
one woman could not have overcome the victim.
well, are you talking about multiple killers?
no.
we found no evidence to support that theory.
I believe this crime was committed by one man.
a man who feeds turkeys.
based upon?
are you two familiar with the principles of aviary digestion?
no. - No.
in the simplest terms, the digested pecan particulate we found in the blowback is the result of intense dehydration and compression, thanks to the unique gizzard structure of the common turkey.
is there an uncommon turkey?
Yes. The oscellated turkey, lives solely in the Yucatan Peninsula.
but assuming this crime happened in Virginia...
I asked the co-op to provide a list of who feeds turkeys in the area, and take a look.
Dan Lambertt is on this list, the victim's father-in-law.
we go to where he keeps his turkeys, I bet we find the bullet.
fire in the hole!
found this gun in your septic tank, and the bullet was right here.
how could he do that to my girls?
he was having an affair; he was cheating on them.
weren't three wives enough?
you understand, don't you, Agent Booth?
you know why I did this.
that doesn't make it right.
I tried to talk some sense into him.
he wouldn't listen.
well, that doesn't give you the right to take it in your own hands and do what you did.
Hi, Cam. - Hi, guys.
you'll be relieved to know at we caught the killer.
Oh, good. Who-who did it ?
the father of the sister-wives.
wait, isn't that your prospective partner over there?
it is. Hey, Doc.
I am such a fool.
would you like to join us?
Oh, God, no.
n... I mean, no. No. You guys can...
Yeah, I think she wants to be alone.
you look beautiful.
thank you.
well, a night off can do wonders.
Yeah. It's nice, isn't it?
we should make it a habit.
let me get your coat.
wow, is that my scarf?
Yeah.
go ahead.
they make a nice couple, don't they?
Yeah, they do.
should you call Hannah and ask her to join us?
she enjoys drinking alcohol very much.
Nah, she's working late, you know?
Hey, could I get the usual here?
coming up.
so, this case proves that, um, two's company.
you were right.
the Samuel wives only appeared to be happy with their arrangement.
right. The one guy who was happy ended up dead.
do you think Ed Samuel loved all of his wives equally?
no, mm-mm, he loved the first one the most.
how do you know? - The schedule.
but each week each wife was assigned two nights apiece, and he spent Sunday nights alone.
well, he was supposed to spend Sunday alone.
he didn't?
he went back to the first one. - He did?
every Sunday, that's what they said.
what does that mean?
well, it means, Bones, that, you know, you could love a lot of people in this world, but there's only one person that you love the most.
well, how do you know which person you love the most when you're confused by chemical messages traveling throughout your limbic system?
you just do.
what if you let that person get away?
that person's not going anywhere.
we are a good team, all of us.
the best.
can't believe you forgot your binoculars.
a lepidopterist without binoculars is like a day without sunshine.
guess I was nervous to meet you. Never done the online date thing before.
there's a red-banded hairstreak.
it's so beautiful. Look what's next to it.
right. Another butterfly. - Hckberry Emperor.
of course. Guess I'm just tired.
we've only been at it for a few hours.
when you e-mailed me and said you were into butterflies, it sounded romantic, not like school.
you're not really a lepidopterist, are you?
no, Gary. I'm just a woman looking for a man.
Yeah. And I brought a blanket.
fantastic!
look at these. Oh, look at these.
a swarm of Silvery Checkerspots.
Oh, my God. This is romantic.
but you're going to remember this a lot more than those butterflies, Gary.
they don't usually swarm like this. - Neither do I.
I hate online dating.
partially skeletonized. Ribs splayed open.
I have a feeling this wasn't natural causes. Animal or psycho?
probably. The angle of the mandible and the brow of the skull indicate a male.
about 40 to 50, judging by the wear on the mandibular teeth.
Hey. What's - what's with all the butterflies?
Chlosyne nycteis. They're the Silvery Checkerspot. Indigenous to the area.
they're probably just attracted by the remains.
whoa, whoa, wait. Butterflies eat dead people?
Oh. Right. - What the hell?
something smells like sulfur. It's coming from the remains. It's...
hate when you do that.
it's not a typical... odor associated with decomposition.
who would leave a goat out here? - Who cares about a goat? Okay?
we're dealing with a dead body here. Look, shouldn't there be more blood?
Yes. It-it appears all of the blood has been drained from the victim's body.
I'm guessing psycho.
but look at the ribs, two through six, on the left side.
bite marks. - Cannibal?
no. It-it's not human dentition.
I'm confused. - Me, too. And I don't like the feeling.
so, the heart is gone?
well, it's like someone ate it right out of his chest.
the victim's right ankle has a vertical transarticular pin that was surgically implanted to fix a past fracture.
could be a helpful identifier.
very good, Mr. Nigel Murray.
while I have your attention and affection, there's something that I'd like to say.
can you speak while working? - Of course.
as you may be aware, I am currently participating in Alcoholics Anonymous, pursuant to my unfortunate downward spiral in the aftermath of my Jeopardy! win.
I had no idea you were in AA.
Yes, well, as with everything else, discretion has been my watchword.
except when I was vomiting into someone's hat.
these look like spiny bristles from some kind of animal.
Oh, and the evidence on the X-rays shows bone damage on the ribs from long fang-like teeth.
Oh. Maybe the heart was eaten.
but anyway, I'm currently at step nine of 12,
not necessary. Don't even remember being wronged.
I urinated in your tadpole tank, Dr. Hodgins. - What?
Mr. Nigel Murray, that's disgusting. - Of course.
anyway, Dr. Hodgins, I apologize.
Dr. Saroyan. - No.
all I want to hear from you right now are facts about this case.
okay. At this point, from all of the evidence that I've gathered from the X-rays, as well as the observable evidence on the remains, - indicates that our victim was killed by a cryptid. - Cryptid?
a creature yet unrecognized by scientific consensus. Of course.
Oh, no. You guys aren't going to start talking about werewolves, are you?
no, no, no. I would posit that it was a chupacabra.
a spiny creature the size of a bear.
but no one has ever captured or verified this chupacabra.
no. But reports show that it sucks out its victim's blood, and leaves behind the scent of sulfur.
and you found a goat tethered to a stake there.
Chupacabra means " goat sucker.
so for cause of death, you want me to put down " goat sucker.
Oh... What is that?
the murder victim's stomach contents.
you know, if you're hungry, there's uneaten food in the kitchen.
you're right. I'm sorry.
there's just something about a pregnant woman that precludes twisted humor.
what's up? - So I looked at the clothes that our guy was wearing.
apparently, he did not scrimp on the duds.
everything was brand new. It was like he was wearing a costume.
so maybe he wasn't really an outdoorsman at all.
Oh, and guess what? Vincent just apologized to me.
Oh. Step number nine: making amends?
Yeah. He apologized for using my letter opener to clean his fingernails.
and for telling his entire darts team that he slept with me.
Oh, my God. What is with him?
he was drunk. - Well, but still?
it's not like I'm going to run into his darts team.
well, you are a better person than I am.
Really? I'm not going to forget that you told me that.
you identified the victim how?
well, no real hunter goes out to the woods in brand-new clothes, right?
so he had to be a tourist.
so I sent his description to the hotels and lodges in the area and I got a hit.
pine Tree Manor.
Yeah, they said they had a guest by the name of Lee Coleman, who disappeared and left his stuff behind.
the Lee Coleman.
why do you keep saying his name as if I should know him?
lee Coleman. Kill the Myth.
it's a TV show on the Wilderness Network.
I've never seen it. - Wow. Do you even own a TV?
of course. It's in the closet.
well, naturally. Anyway, on the show, Coleman would go out and he would debunk different myths and legends.
you know, the Loch Ness monster, the yeti, psychic healers, yada, yada.
I'm not familiar with the "yada yada yada" myth, but the rest of them don't need disproving, because they don't exist.
I mean, you haven't seen the backside of the moon, but you believe in it.
what?
just trying to think of an amusing quip about the backside of your moon.
all right, great. What if Coleman was in the woods trying to disprove the chupacabra for Kill the Myth?
and the myth killed him instead. - It could happen.
no, it couldn't. You can't be killed by something that doesn't exist.
well, you can if it does exist.
I don't think you understand what the word "myth" means.
now what?
perhaps you could see your dark side if you mooned a mirror.
because "moon" is a term that refers to exposing...
I know, Bones. - Get it? It - it's pretty clever, right?
it's clever, yeah, clever.
Yeah, I'd laugh but it's that, uh, I'm afraid of driving off the road.
I understand. - You do, right?
safety first. - Oh, yeah.
I understand.
odd that they would call it the Pine Tree Manor when it's obviously clad in cedar.
I was just thinking that.
Really? - No.
hello. - Hello.
welcome to the Pine Tree Manor.
it would more properly be called the Cedar Siding Manor.
right. Uh, FBI, Special Agent Seeley Booth.
this here's my colleague, Dr. Temperance Brennan.
you must be here because of the myth guy.
I'm Randy Shepard, I own the place. Is it true what we're hearing?
what are you hearing? - That something got the guy.
out in the woods. Something... horrible.
and how'd you hear that? - From me.
who are you? - I'm Melissa Lawson.
Melissa's our activities coordinator.
what does that mean?
fishing, hikes, bird-watching, nature trails, hunting.
Mr. Coleman sort of monopolized Melissa the three days he was here.
he was filming an episode of that show of his.
to debunk the chupacabra. - Yeah. And it got him.
we've had sightings.
people used to come from all over just to get a glimpse of one.
what's it look like?
Hello?
so, I've analyzed those dermal cells we found on the remains.
turns out they are skin, but not human.
now, judging by the heavily keratinized stratum corneum, they appear to be reptilian.
Reptilian? - There's more.
that's hair. - Mm-hmm, and definitely mammalian.
no. Th-th-that makes no sense.
reptile scales and mammalian hair don't coexist on any known animal.
Really? What about this?
chupacabra.
I'm Lee Coleman, and I've made it my life's mission to disprove some of the world's most tenacious myths, legends and monsters.
don't be a fool.
myth killed!
kill the myth and find the truth.
join me next week as I brave the deep woods of West Virginia in search of the mythic chupacabra...
...a creature whose name means "goat sucker.
but I'm going to prove that if you believe in him, you are the sucker.
that promo wasn't shot in West Virginia.
it was a park near the studio. I can't believe he's gone.
well, you were his producer. You must've known he was going out there.
I rarely knew what Lee was up to.
he insisted on doing all of his own research.
can you think of anyone who would want to harm Lee?
he made a career out of making people look like fools.
everyone he debunked probably wanted him dead.
believers in superstitions like these, they turn to illogical explanations as a way of deriving control in a frightening and uncertain world.
they're nuts. - That's a more succinct way of putting it.
but when a person like that has his way of life challenged, becoming violent would not be surprising.
you know, Lee was attacked once, by a dog.
he debunked a dog? What - what was it pretending to be?
he debunked a pet psychic. She lost a lot of clients.
um, one day Lee was coming out of the studio, and this dog just went for him.
and the pet psychic was just across the street watching the whole thing.
was it her dog? - She denied it, but why else would she be there?
that mutt latched onto Lee's leg, he fell, broke his ankle, had to have surgery, and we couldn't even touch the psychic.
when was this? - Last year.
but he insisted on re-running the episode two weeks ago.
he disappeared right after that.
I told him he should forget about her.
she's a loon, but he wanted to go after her again.
I've never seen bone damage like this before.
normally, puncture marks resulting from carnivorous scavenging are accompanied by pits in the cortical bone surfaces.
which are not in evidence.
mysteriously.
so I'll analyze the wounds and try and establish which were caused by small animals and which might have been caused by the chupacabra.
you are not letting this chupacabra thing go, are you?
I'd be skeptical if you told me that there was a venomous, egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed mammal, and yet, the platypus... it does exist.
Mr. Nigel Murray, do you need me to take that alcohol away from you?
no, don't be absurd. This is, uh, 80% ethyl alcohol.
I would most likely go blind if I were to drink this.
if... yeah, yeah. Take it away from me?
Yeah. - Take the top.
Dr. Saroyan. Sorry.
I really need you to let me apologize to you. For my sobriety.
fine. Shoot. - Thank you.
I once went into your office, uh, when you weren't there, and I noticed that your desk drawer was open.
and I saw a stack of grocery coupons from the Sunday paper.
okay. Continue.
and I took some of the coupons.
I took one, it was for a soda, and I took another one for a cheese snack, and the third was for a frozen fish dinner.
three coupons. - Yeah. I was tipsy.
I understand. And as long as that's it, I forgive you.
what?
I also told some mates from Paleontology that you and I, that we enjoyed a passionate and extremely gymnastic sexual relationship.
what? - Yes. I did... it's all true.
I can't believe you did that.
I - I - I know, I know, and I am deeply, deeply sorry. It was the hooch.
Oh, forget it.
the injuries on the bones...
I would like an explanation for them as soon as possible.
one that will not be met with derision.
I shouldn't have told her about the coupons.
I think the victim is providing a valuable service by debunking these myths.
take a look at this. This is your proof.
Oh, no, don't be angry at me.
your priest is the one who has tricked you.
look. I put up a hidden camera, and this is what it recorded last night.
your priest has rigged this statue to cry.
you know, some of these segments that Coleman recorded used hidden cameras.
he wouldn't need a camera crew.
for his exposé on the chupacabra, he might have put up cameras.
they could still be there.
exactly. - I should watch this show.
you know, not all miracles are fake, Bones.
there's a reasonable explanation for all phenomenon.
you know I saw a yeti.
don't be ridiculous. Yetis don't exist.
I was in Nepal. Rangers have a secure training base there.
I was doing field exercises, about to rendezvous with my platoon, and... I saw it.
about 30, 35 feet in front of me.
you were in the snow.
in unfamiliar terrain, alone, hallucinations are common.
it was over ten feet tall. It was huge.
I looked straight in its eyes.
I pointed my rifle at it, and it ran. This was no hallucination.
booth, I'm sure you thought... - Okay, why don't you just trust me, here?
why can't you just use that brilliant scientific mind of yours
you-you're serious?
just forget it. You know, you talk a really good game, Bones, but when it comes down to it, you're no different than people who were certain that the Sun revolved around the Earth.
that's not true.
well, I did some readings for Nancy Reagan.
her dog, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Rex... cute little thing...
he had some issues with being in the public eye.
you can understand. - Sure, sure.
well, Hobart likes you.
thinks you have a kind and understanding face.
hello. Hello.
hobart looks like a very nice bird as well.
I'm here to ask you about... - Lee Coleman. I know. Horrible man.
he has no idea how many animals he hurt by spreading those lies about me.
you were angry about that. - Well, we all were.
Uh-huh. Well, he thought you were responsible for the dog attacking him.
that's nonsense. Hadley acted on his own.
of course. But you were with Hadley when he attacked.
I mean, you could've restrained him.
well, we were taking a walk, it all happened very fast. - Hello.
and he does regret the pain that he caused.
he told you that?
we communicated, yes.
Yes, I was seeing a client. A horse.
he felt emotionally displaced because his owners got a pony.
well, the farmer who hired you said that you came and went on your own schedule.
what are you implying?
you're the psychic, Ms. Michaels. I'm sure you can figure it out.
you know, your business was hurt. You felt humiliated and ridiculed.
you wanted revenge.
I did not kill that dreadful man.
I was at the farm. Ask the horse.
or the chickens. They all saw me.
right. - I am not crazy, Dr. Sweets. And I do want to help.
I heard that you found a goat at the murder scene?
if you want me to talk to him...
Nah. No, thank you. But thank you.
good-bye. - I'm just going to leave.
so if Coleman used a hidden camera out here, he probably would've had it aimed where the goat was tethered.
you really had to volunteer us for this, huh?
Yeah! Thought coming out to the woods would be nice, you know?
little fresh air.
honey, let me share something with you. There's a human growing inside me.
recent studies show that mothers who gain excess weight during pregnancy make their babies more prone to childhood obesity.
Oh. That's interesting.
I read a study that says that husbands who suggest their pregnant wives are fat are far more prone to being slugged by them.
right. Okay, then. Cameras.
Yes. - Cameras...
so I watched the segments of Kill the Myth that Brennan sent, coleman always seems to use the same type of camera.
it's a fixed-lens infrared surveillance camera, with a maximum focal length of 20 feet.
you know what I don't understand? - What's that, babe?
how come a creature whose name means "goat sucker" didn't suck the goat?
cause there's no such thing as a chupacabra.
Oh. This coming from the woman that believes the stars control our fates.
of course you're going to belittle astrology. You're a Virgo.
think I got something.
well, h-how are we going to get up there? - It's just a little tree.
Hey, babe, you're going to be a father. I don't want anything to happen to you.
okay, but please, please be careful.
okay.
got it. - Hold on tight.
all right, now I'm going to throw this down to you, okay?
Yeah.
got it.
um, it looks like there's some water damage, but I might be able to recover some data from the memory card.
if this timestamp is correct, this was taken on the night that Lee Coleman was killed.
he might have recorded his own murder.
this is the original image of the damage done to the victim's ribs and torso.
now here I've eliminated all injuries caused from postmortem scavenging, leaving only the wounds incurred during the initial attack.
what is this triangle? - That is a bite mark.
presumably the result of two upper incisors and a single lower incisor.
I'm not familiar with any animal with that configuration of teeth.
like that.
legend says that that is how the goat sucker drains blood from its prey.
Hodgins is analyzing the swab from the injury site.
we'll see what he comes up with that doesn't rely on legend.
I'm-I'm very very sorry.
Why? You've done more than satisfactory work.
Oh! No, no, no, no. Um...
as part of my recovery, uh, for drinking a lot, and having fun,
I have to make amends.
all right. What for?
one night, I borrowed your iguana and wore it as a hat.
at a party.
well, you must have taken care of him because I didn't see any damage.
and also I have to apologize for spreading a rumor...
that you and I were lovers.
but it was nothing serious. We were on and off.
we were just each other's sexual playthings.
and please remember that I'm apologizing for things that I did when I was besotted with drink.
why are you laughing?
I mean, your-your friends must be very gullible.
no, they're not. Not particularly.
then they must have been inebriated and incapable of rational thought.
stranger things have happened.
I've been told that I'm an... I'm an excellent lover.
so...
it appears that I've hurt your feelings.
no. No, no, it's-it's all part of the process, and I have to accept the consequences of my actions as part of my recovery.
then I'm glad that I could help. I must say that I'm impressed that you were able to get my iguana to stay on top of your head.
I'm clever with ribbons.
here you go.
I'm so sorry to bother you, Agent Booth, but I really need to talk to you about Lee Coleman's murder.
sure. Come on in. No problem. Have a seat.
I started thinking that if someone killed Lee, - I could be next. - You?
maybe I'm crazy, But before I produced Lee's show - I worked with a man named Terry Bemis. - Okay, who is Terry Bemis?
he had a show on the Wilderness Network: Seeing Is Believing.
he's probably the most famous cryptozoologist in the country.
that's very impressive, but I don't know what that means.
cryptozoology is the study of hidden animals.
animals whose very existence is in doubt.
Oh, right. Like the chupacabra?
look, the point is that Lee got Terry booted off the Wilderness Network.
Oh, so you left crypto guy and you went with Lee.
Yes. The network wanted me to.
Terry was very angry, as you would expect.
he started making threats, which I didn't believe at the time.
but I did get this e-mail yesterday.
heard about Lee. " Some people get what they deserve, I guess.
wonder how things will turn out for you?
do you know where I can find Terry Bemis now?
where else? Public Access.
this is the footage from the hidden camera we found in the tree.
my goat friend and I have been waiting here for eight hours.
the only thing we've been attacked by are mosquitoes.
which is strange, because if these woods are supposedly riddled with chupacabra, you would expect at least one of them to jump on the only goat within a hundred mile radius.
what he's saying makes sense, but he's really unlikable.
the sun's gonna be up soon, and since these creatures are supposedly nocturnal, Billy Goat Gruff and I might as well call it a night.
nothing for us there.
that's what I thought at first, too, but check this out.
okay, here it is. - What?
look at the goat's ears just before Coleman shuts off the camera.
Oh, wow, he heard something.
Mm-hmm. Something Coleman didn't hear.
can you work some sort of audio magic, see if you can pick it up?
Yeah, it's worth a try.
did a GC Mass Spec on the swab results from our little triangular bite.
I expected to find saliva, but instead I got that.
bisphenol A, diethyl propane and amorphous silica. " What is that?
no clue, but as much as it pains me to say, it's probably not chupacabra spit.
did you I. D. the dermis and those needles we found on the body?
Yeah, I did. The reptile scales belonged to Ctenosaura pectinata;
or Mexican spiny-tailed iguana, and the needles, the needles were from a wild boar.
are those rare? - No, not anywhere you can buy a hairbrush.
this seems to be shaping up to be nothing more than a hoax.
don't sound so sad.
do you really want to live in a world where chupacabras roam free?
Yes, I really do.
so, our friend the animal psychic has an alibi.
don't tell me.
she was feeding a flock of pigeons in the park, and they're all willing to testify.
close. Counseling a horse. - I was making a joke.
I know. Still, just afraid of driving off the road. You know, great.
anyway, the horse's owner placed her on the farm.
I did some research. - Really?
the tracks you saw in Nepal are easily explained.
I believe they were the tracks of smaller animals widened by the afternoon sun.
I didn't see just tracks. I saw the Abominable Snowman himself, hmm?
he looked at me, and I looked at him.
I believe you saw what you say you saw.
but you believe it was a hallucination. - No, I believe you actually saw it.
Ah. A yeti? - No.
what you saw was Ursus arctos isabellinus.
they're usually red or sandy in color, but the one you saw was covered in ice.
a seven-foot-tall bear covered in ice?
Yes. Ursus arctos makes this sound much like a human being grunting.
you did a lot of work on this.
Yes. I believe you saw exactly what you say you saw.
you're simply calling it by the wrong name.
Ah, thank you, Bones. I appreciate you, you know, giving me the benefit of the doubt.
you're welcome.
okay, look, this guy has got two motives, okay.
one, revenge for getting booted to Public Access, and two, he earns a living talking about mythical animals.
also, he'd be an expert at faking a chupacabra attack. - Three, two, one.
I received word this week that there was a sighting of one of the most elusive cryptids:
the Bukit Timah Monkey Man, an immortal hominid that lives in the forests of Singapore.
what more proof do you need?
well, this is a treat.
it looks like we're being joined today
forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan is here.
please, join me, Doctor. Kevin, get a chair!
should I go? - Why not? It's not like anybody's watching.
hello.
Hello! Welcome. - Thank you.
it is always a pleasure to meet a fellow scientist.
I do not accept the premise that cryptozoology is a science.
I would point out that every major advance in the history of science was at first dismissed as fairy tale or pseudoscience.
Cryptozoologists begin with a conclusion and then work backwards to prove it.
that is not science. That's the opposite of science.
I'm sorry, did you just come here to insult me and my work?
no, I came here because you're a suspect in the murder of Lee Coleman.
and we'll be right back.
so now I have to talk to a shrink?
why, because I believe there are creatures the scientific community doesn't accept?
no, no, I think this has more to do with the e-mail you sent to Ms. Tweed.
it was an e-mail! A piece of paper.
not even... until it was printed.
the FBI sees it as a threat.
so I'm here to try and understand why you sent it.
I was angry that I lost my show. I'm sorry.
look, I know people think I'm a little off because of my field of study.
Oh, no. I mean, I study the human mind,
Yes. Right, yes.
and you had a forum on the Wilderness Channel to educate people.
I was gonna get a publishing deal and everything.
to distribute your findings.
I could have legitimized cryptozoology.
you must have been very angry.
the son of a bitch destroyed my life and he took my producer.
I'm on a community college station now.
my show airs at 2: 00 in the morning. How would you feel?
angry.
not angry enough to kill someone.
I didn't kill him. I didn't have to.
the chupacabra beat me to it.
Coleman had such disdain for my work.
the FBI's convinced that the whole attack was faked, that there's no such thing as a chupacabra.
there's ample literature that proves otherwise.
is this your own self-published literature we're talking about?
it doesn't matter.
with all the media frenzy over Coleman's death, those woods are like Grand Central Station.
I'm sure the chupacabra has long since fled.
it's like the Loch Ness fiasco all over again.
Yeah, possibly.
uh, but the forensics team is combing though all of the evidence.
so I'm sure they'll find the truth.
that's what you want, isn't it? The truth?
you just turned up the volume. I could've done that.
I also used a multiband digital noise gate to remove the ambient sounds and I reconstituted the compressed information above the Nyquist frequency. Okay?
I think you've made your point, yes.
this is what we have left.
they both sound animal-like. - Yeah, well, the first one is.
I've identified it as the mating call of a whitetail deer.
and the second sound? - Well, I haven't cracked that one yet.
it sounds like an animal, but look at it on the EQ visualiser.
it has a recurring consistent pattern that suggests it's mechanical.
Oh! We have an audio database?
Yeah, we sure do. It has over 35 million sounds.
check this out. So this is an Italian man sneezing.
this is the engine of an old Model T.
how about an F3 tornado?
here's a raisin falling in milk.
did someone just drop a raisin into some milk?
sorry to interrupt.
there's something that I need to show you, Dr. Saroyan.
no confessions? - I confess, no.
I sorted through the dentition of dozens of carnivorous animals, and I finally found a match to the puncture wounds on the victim's ribs.
they are consistent with the bite of a black bear.
a black bear?
Yes. And also, when I looked back at the X-rays,
I noticed a uniform separation of the bones in the joints of both ankles, totally even. And that's odd.
I also found evidence of abrasions on the tissue left on the ankles.
and look at this.
the cervical and lumbar vertebrae appear to be separated.
this is all consistent with him being hung upside down by his ankles.
which would explain the abrasions.
of course. His blood wasn't sucked out by some mythical creature.
it was drained using the same method employed by hunters.
remember that chemical compound I found in the bite mark?
bisphenol A, diethyl propane and amorphous silica.
dude, this isn't Jeopardy!
I finally figured out what contained those three chemicals.
jaw Jelly.
are you thinking of taking up taxidermy?
no, this is relevant to the case.
I believe the bite marks to Coleman's ribs came from a taxidermied bear.
right, so he was killed by a stuffed animal?
whoever simulated this attack used a bear tooth to imitate the tripartite incisor pattern ascribed to a chupacabra.
and I know where we can find a stuffed bear.
it's a lot busier here than it was.
well, it looks like a monster attack is what this place needed, eh?
look at that. $159 a night now.
that's a bear.
one of the bear's incisors has been removed.
I can use the corresponding incisors to confirm that the tooth used to stab Coleman came from this bear.
I expect nothing less. - Back again?
Yeah. Wow, business really is booming, isn't it?
well, I hate that it came on the back of Mr. Coleman's misfortune, but I'm grateful for the guests.
can I see your hands? - My hands?
Yeah, you know, the things at the end of your arms there. Your hands.
look at that. Rope burns.
it's what happens when you hoist animals up to drain their blood.
isn't that right, Randy?
a psychologist? - It's my job to determine whether you're capable of murdering and mutilating a human being.
a guy would have to be crazy to do something like that, right?
what do you think? - Yeah, I guess so.
I'm not crazy. So I guess I couldn't have done it.
our people did find Lee Coleman's epithelial cells on the rope in your supply closet.
rope burns on your hands and vestiges of your DNA on the rope.
can you explain that? - I didn't kill him. I'm not crazy.
all right, you just said that as though you know who did kill him.
I did? - Yes. Do you know who killed him?
no. How would I?
all right.
what are you writing?
hmm? Oh, don't worry. I just advise the FBI.
I don't actually decide who's arrested and tried for murder.
so what are you telling them?
I am advising them that in my professional opinion, you're lying.
that and the rope and the skin cells...
they'll probably arrest you. You'll be needing a lawyer.
all right, thank you for your time.
wait.
I-I didn't kill the guy, but I did the rest.
the rest?
Yeah, the draining of the blood, the heart. Yes, I did that stuff.
Why?
I came across the body. Since he was already dead,
I thought if it looked like he was killed by the chupacabra, then he wouldn't have died in vain.
you know, most people who find a corpse in the woods, they call the police.
the lodge is in debt, I was gonna lose it.
Coleman was my best chance at saving my business.
that's not crazy, is it?
exactly how did you fake the attack?
took the bear tooth and made the bite marks with it.
spread some insecticide around to make it smell like sulfur.
and then you tore out his heart and hung him up to drain the blood?
but I didn't shoot the guy.
nobody said anything about shooting.
well, I just meant... - Who did? Who shot him?
it wasn't me.
I didn't even have the heart to kill the goat.
Where's the bullet?
I buried it with the heart.
since I didn't kill the guy, that's not so bad, is it?
no, it's bad. It's very bad, Randy.
very bad.
you wanted to see me?
Yeah, I want to show you something on the rope.
Oh. Oh, good.
what? You seem nervous.
truth be told, I thought that you might be upset that I told the world I was sleeping with your wife.
Vincent, you were drunk. Come on. I understand.
Oh. Oh, wonderful. Okay, the rope.
Yeah, yeah, just take a look at the epithelial cells through the microscope.
they look no different than before to me.
hmm. Yeah, that's-that's what I thought, too, so I was just...
I was just... checking. Thanks.
Oh, no, no, you're welcome.
do you really think I'm that petty?
no, no, of course not. Thank you.
you are a kind and understanding man, Dr. Hodgins.
so this is the mating call of a whitetail deer.
and this is the first sound on the tape again.
that's not a match. - 'Cause it's not a real deer.
so I went back in the audio database.
this is the sound... ...of a man-made deer call.
that's a match. What about the second sound?
a motorcycle?
actually, it's a gas-powered four-stroke engine.
an all-terrain vehicle like the kind they had at the lodge.
so someone was out hunting.
she shot him accidentally?
well, she actually said it was his own fault for not wearing an orange vest in the woods.
this is why I'm against hunting.
not because of Bambi? - All right, mostly because of Bambi.
Melissa told Randy what happened, and he used it to his own advantage.
so if Coleman had just worn an orange vest, he'd still be alive, and Randy wouldn't have mutilated him to increase business.
Yep. Here's to stupidity and greed, the two elements that keep us employed.
Cheers!
all right, everyone. That was fun.
see you later, guys. - Good night. Good night.
bones, at any time did you think that the chupacabra was real?
no.
then why did you believe that I saw the yeti in Nepal?
because what I said you saw was totally rational.
I never saw it.
you see, what you did was rationally explain something that never happened.
you never saw the yeti? - Or did I?
no, you didn't.
but you... you did?
are you trying to confuse me? - I might be.
okay, what is your point? - That things are confusing, okay?
just because you can explain something doesn't mean that it's explainable.
do you mean "explicable"? - Sure, like us.
we don't make any sense at all.
good night. - Bye!
how did we even find these remains?
we passed the middle of nowhere about an hour ago.
that's not a legitimate geographical reference.
anonymous call gave us the exact GPS coordinates.
Everglades makes it FBI jurisdiction.
bones makes it your jurisdiction.
that is right.
male, late 20s.
visually impaired.
I kind of figured that out with the glass eye there.
so, where are the clothes? There's no clothes.
well, when you want to get rid of a body, you don't want nothing between the teeth and the meat.
extensive evidence of mammal, fish, reptile and bird scavenging.
this appears to be scoring from human teeth.
Yeah, we get that.
cannibals. - Feral hogs.
hogs got people teeth.
I know a guy made his own set of dentures that way.
feral hogs?
sure.
the serial number for this prosthetic eye is discernible.
great that's all I need.
just give me the serial number, I'll just text it back to the Miami field office and we'll know the identity before we even get back to civilization.
isn't that right, Sheriff?
you bet.
you identified Sam through his glass eye?
acrylic eye, yes.
does that mean his eye is all that's left of him?
well... - Pretty much.
Yeah, I'd say pretty much.
we specialize in historical maritime artifacts.
was this some kind of an accident?
body dump.
murder?
who would murder Sam?
traditionally, that is the question we ask.
there's something you should see.
that's Sam Nozik?
Yes. He failed to report for work ten days ago.
72 hours later, we reported him missing.
this is the last footage we have of Sam.
what is he doing?
something sneaky, that's for sure. I mean, look at him.
he stole an 18th century nautical chart fragment.
our most recent acquisition.
what's it worth?
well, that depends who you talk to.
we're talking to you.
it's worthless, until it's authenticated.
authenticated as what?
the final resting place of the Spanish treasure ship Santa Esperanza.
she sank during a storm in the spring of 1774.
treasure ship?
so when you say worthless, what you actually mean is the exact opposite.
no.
Yes, I get your point.
but there have literally been dozens of these things over the years, and none has turned out to be authentic.
when it comes to such things, it's realistic to be a pessimist.
looks like your security guard was an optimist.
bones, you know those guys who use a forked stick to find water in the desert?
Diviners? - I know one.
I know a man who can do third degree polynomial equations in his head.
no, Bones, I'm not trying to have a conversation with you.
what I'm saying to you is I actually know somebody I could put on the case.
to find the treasure?
treasure maps have gotten people killed for hundreds of years.
it's a chart, Booth.
charts reference water, maps reference land.
find the map, find the murderer.
possibly.
how does he find things?
that son of a bitch has got the finder power.
which one is the son of a bitch?
the him there who isn't a her or the big man that's reading a book. Come on.
you mind? We got an important "philiosophical" debate to resolve.
I think you mean "philosophical" which also does not apply to "Ninja versus Samurai.
A. - You know what?
he's right. I'd definitely go with him.
ninja is all stealth. My bet? Straight up, right on the warrior.
nobody said anything about a bet, Booth.
you still gambling?
it's a figure of speech, Wally.
who sent you?
we need you to find something.
of course you need him to find something.
that's what he does.
his question was, and I quote,"Who sent you?
who are you?
Leo, Walter's legal advisor. Ike there is his bartender. Who are you?
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian Institute.
all right, look. You still on retainer with the FBI?
well, if you were legitimate FBI, you'd know the answer to that question.
I'm going to have to see some credentials.
okay.
you see that? FBI. No.
how about you? - Here you go.
no, don't give him that. - Why not?
just give... That's going to be bad.
too late now.
he's very suspicious. - Why'd you give him that?
you shouldn't just...
now he's biting my ID. He's going to ruin the magnetic strip.
give me the ID, Wally.
Wally, give me the ID. - I'm not done with it yet.
give me the ID. Give me back... Give me back the ID.
a little help.
cold beer while you wait?
wait for what?
for the boys to get reacquainted.
it wouldn't do you any good.
a while back I found the attorney general's son in a crack den.
what is the connection between those two statements?
Walter here has a, uh... shall we say a guardian angel on his shoulder?
isn't that right, Wally?
we can't touch him.
people are very grateful when it comes to the what was once lost and now is found.
uh, Pudge here is blind in one eye.
how can you tell?
it's the way he holds up that scrap of whatever is is to the light.
whatever it is" is a map.
it's a chart fragment, Mr. Sherman.
Oh, please, call me Walter.
Seriously? Focus. Can we? Thank you. Really.
are you two sleeping together?
no. - No.
would you sleep with me?
you know what? You find the map, maybe you got a shot.
what?
he's drunk.
look at him wobble and belch.
the last location was the Santa something.
Esperanza. - Santa Esperanza.
so are you in or are you out?
you know, you're supposed to find that Chinese satellite what crashed to Earth in East Texas.
that doesn't sound real.
Oh, it's real.
I'll squeeze you in, for my old compadre.
but I'm the finder, you're the catchers.
I don't know what that means.
it means I'll find the chart fragment, but it's on you guys to catch the killer.
great. Done deal. Let's go, Bones.
uh, can I get your cell number, please?
