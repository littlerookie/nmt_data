least of all me.
that's what I was sore about.
and the other day, when you drove up in that last straw...
...I knew my goose was cooked. Here I had gone along...
...figuring all the time that I was competing with your passion for fame.
and suddenly, in one fell swoop, I realized I'd been wrong all along.
now, it is just hopeless for me to try and compete...
... with a man who drives a foreign car and wears a silk suit...
...and, no doubt, real gold cuff links.
also, I had a good look at this Joe...
...and, well, I'm only being honest with myself when I say that...
...in my opinion, he's even better-looking than I am.
although I personally have reached a point where I sort of like my looks.
but then, of course, I've been around with them for quite a long while.
well...
...be that as it may...
...I never got around to bringing up the subject of "I love you.
but no doubt you're aware of it.
I'm sorry to bother you with all of this, but...
...I couldn't face handling it in person, and I can't write.
so this is probably the best way.
the reason I did not wanna just disappear...
...is because I wouldn't want you to ever think badly of me.
in fact, I hope that you can remember me...
... with some amount of affection...
...because that is the way I intend to remember you...for the rest of my life.
goodbye, Gladys.
what's doing?
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no!
what do you say? Time's a-wasting. -I hate this idea.
we'll talk later. Put it in your mouth.
no, I'm telling you-- -Just do it, will you, Gladys?
all right, let's have the pose.
just let your arms hang down. That's right.
and look miserable.
I can do that without even trying, mister.
and don't talk.
that's it. Let's get the next one. Snap it up now.
why did I let you rope me into this? -Rope?
this is one of the best touches we've hit.
I feel foolish, and I don't like to feel foolish.
why, sugar?
because. -Don't you realize that every place...
...that uses this display, we get $20? They're talking about 1 000 displays.
don't you understand what that means? 20, 000.
there's one thing you forget. -What?
it's a fake. -Oh, come on.
not only that, it's dishonest. -Well, don't worry about it.
and it's not dignified. -Well, isn't tomorrow dignified?
what tomorrow? -The Air Force.
I got them to name a plane after you and your picture taken...
...with generals and colonels and everything. Isn't that dignified?
well, yes, but this isn't.
well, will you let me run it, baby?
I've done a lot of things in my life, some stupid, but never crooked.
okay.
and certain people I know, they're gonna know it's a fake.
what do you care? -I don't mean everybody.
but a few people. One.
I care what they think. Him. He.
I don't even know where he is, but wherever he is
will you close your mouth?
I wrote a speech for you for tomorrow. You have to memorize it.
and wear something simple and dignified.
because tomorrow is dignified.
Yeah, but today isn't.
what do you say? -All set.
okay, clear it. Here we go, Gladys.
let's have the pose.
let's see a smile now.
Oh, no! A real smile!
think of the money.
think of not doing this anymore.
good! Hold it!
to think that of all the girls in America...
...you have
no. You men of the...
...military air transport service...
...have chosen me "the girl we would most like to...be up in the air with.
and all I can say, from the bottom of my...
from the bottom of my... -Heart.
from the bottom of my heart. Let me read it from the paper.
gen. Dunkley, Col. Wiley and all you fine men.
this has been the greatest day of my life.
to think that of all the girls in America...
...you men of the military air transport service...
...have chosen me "the girl we would most like to be up in the air with.
hold it! Hold it! -Move in closer, fellas.
put your arms on them. Everyone look at her.
quiet, will you, please? We're trying to tape this. Start again, Gladys!
gen. Dunkley, Col. Wiley and all you fine men
kiss her, somebody! Kiss her! One on each side.
look like you enjoy it! -Quiet! Quiet! Start again, Gladys!
gen. Wunkley, Col. Diley and all you fi
fine men...
...to think that of all the girls in America, you men of the military...
...air transport service have chosen me:
the girl you would most like to be up in a plane with." And naming this...
...magnificent plane after me, I can only say, from the bottom of my...
heart. From the bottom of my heart, this means...
it's all right. She's just nervous. Stay there. We'll be back.
she's okay, nothing to worry.
what's the matter? -I don't know.
you sick? -No.
what are you trying to do? This wasn't easy to set up.
I don't care. -You don't care?
who are you not to care? Now, come on. Pull yourself together here.
get through with this, or I'll drop you like a hot potato.
I wish you would. I wish everybody would drop me. Just leave me alone.
where do you come off throwing temperament around here? You cluck!
what? -You heard me.
you're a nobody that I've blown up into a property.
you haven't done so much, Mr. Clinton.
you just made me a freak. -You were a freak...
...when I first met you, only I'm showing you how to cash in on it.
you've been doing all right too, right? -Sure, sweetie.
we've been doing all right, and we can continue.
and we can do better, only you have to stay in line.
No! -Why no?
because it's all over, the whole thing. The whole goofy thing.
there's no sense to it, no nothing.
what's the good of being above the crowd all the time?
what's wrong with being part of it?
what is all this? -Well, if you don't understand...
...I'm just sorry for you, that's all.
it isn't just making a name. What's that?
it's making a name stand for something...
...even on one block, instead of for nothing all over the world.
now, wait a minute-- -What most people want is privacy.
that's about the greatest thing anybody can have.
you know what's the trouble with you? You're not real.
I'm real enough to pop you one. -Try it.
all right. Now we blow off the steam.
now let's get down to the facts.
the fact is...
...there's only one thing I want.
like what? -You can't get it for me.
I don't even think I can get it myself.
but I'm gonna have to try.
what's happening? -Just a spin. Be right there.
Roger. -Yeah, yeah, roger.
now, listen, Gladys-- -Okay, I'll do it.
that girl.
now, look, kid. I'll forget everything you just said...
...and you forget everything I just said. Fair enough?
look, honey, don't conk out on me. We got all this stuff going for us.
and listen, Gladys, the way the dough is rolling, I figure
and listen, Gladys, the way the dough is rolling, I figure
hold it, fellas. Ladies and gentlemen...
...on behalf of Gladys Glover, she just wants me to say that, well...
...she was a little overwhelmed, but she's all right now.
gen. Dunkley, Col. Wiley...
...and all you fine men...
...this has been the greatest day of my life.
not only because you wanna name a plane after me...
...but because today I found out I don't want you to.
and why?
I'm nobody to name a plane after.
I don't stand for anything.
but that plane does...
...and so do you fellas.
that makes you somebody, even if nobody knows your names...
...Whatever they are. Because every one of you are one of the crowd.
Hey, that's an idea.
why don't you call your plane One of the Crowd?
because that's what it is, and that's what makes it great.
gen. Dunkley, Col. Wiley...
...and all you fine men...
...hooray.
that's it. Laugh it up!
that's it. Don't go away, anybody.
so I really appreciate your help, folks.
you see, the idea is this. We're making this picture...
...on how the people who come here look to the animals. See what I mean?
now, the shot that we're trying for is you looking at the chimp, you see?
okay, here we go. Now, everybody watches me just as if I'm the chimp.
you see what I mean?
you know?
everybody's looking up at me.
that's it!
that's it! Everybody watches me. Let's go, kids.
all right. Somebody down front, throw a peanut at me, would you? That's it.
one at a time.
take it easy, will you?
that's it. Take it easy! Take it easy.
one at a time. One at a time. That's it.
everybody's watching the chimpanzee.
every...
well, wouldn't you know it? Just as we're getting it going almost.
Hey, Pete! Look, will you?
I figure we can make it to Pittsburgh before dark.
like to get just past and get a nice little room...
...in one of those motels and get right to bed.
then in the morning, get in an hour on the road before breakfast.
can't we have breakfast first?
I'll tell you what. I will get up first and bring you back your breakfast in bed.
how about that, Mrs. Sheppard?
fine.
you don't like me because I don't smile for the camera.
you don't like me because I don't suck up to the press.
you don't like me because I make a lot of money.
but you love me.
because I'm one of the greatest hitters alive.
announcer: We're back in Milwaukee, and the sound you hear reverberating across the cities and farms of the great state of Wisconsin is the roar of the Brewer faithful for their longtime hero, Stan Ross.
and here he comes with that trademark arrogant scowl.
2, 999 hits to date in his illustrious career.
will this at-bat, July 29, 1995, against the rookie right-hander Billy Earll, be the historic moment when Ross joins only 20 other major leaguers in that elite 3, 000-hit club?
Stan.
you're gonna be the best-looking cat in the Hall of Fame, that's for doggone sure.
yo, scrub!
you want my autograph now or after I make history?
you ain't getting this hit off me.
this is gonna be your one career highlight.
you're gonna be a game-show answer.
well, I'll take "Kiss my Ass" for $1, 000.
make it 3, 000.
you hear that language on that rookie?
kiss my ass.
how about you, Ernie?
you're gonna tell me to kiss your ass, too?
why don't you suck my...
I'll show you what kiss my ass look like.
I'll show him. I'll put up this...
damn it, Joe! He know better than to get me pissed off!
announcer: No pitcher wants to be the one that gives up that 3, 000th base hit.
clearly Earll just sent that message.
a purpose pitch to get Ross angry.
come on, this is the one. You know what I'm talking about!
hope he trips and breaks his leg.
Uhh! -ANNOUNCER: Oh, my!
it's a vicious line drive off Earll's...
well, it's a bell-ringing base hit.
that's what it is.
Stan Ross is safe at first.
Hey, Coach, get me that ball.
that's the ball that got me to the Hall of Fame.
you want this ball, Ross? -Yeah. Thanks, man.
there goes your damn ball.
you see that, Coach?
you see what he just did?
he threw my Hall of Fame ball in the stands.
what's your problem?
back up. Back up. -Move, man!
you be out when I get back, or someone will have to pull a piece of baseball history out the crack of your ass!
what you looking at? -Make a move.
okay, I'll shrink your big ass.
you'll get some, too.
you saw what he did, Coach.
all right, guys.
that ain't gonna mean nothing.
get back in.
who got my ball? Open that gate.
all right! He's coming on up.
Hey, congratulations, Stan! -[ Laughing ]
[ laughing stops ] -Give me my ball.
what? -WOMAN: What'd he say?
give me my 3, 000-hit ball.
don't look at your daddy. Give me my ball!
whoa, make him a trade at least.
give him your cap or an autographed bat.
I'm not trading him! -Hey, whoa!
what the... Are you all right, pal?
why don't you take his cotton candy while you're at it?
were you glad to get number 3, 000 here in Milwaukee?
sure. You ask any of the all-time greats, man.
we all got a special connection with our hometown fans.
what connection did you make with that kid who caught the ball tonight?
what you talkin' about?
people in that section say you threatened him.
I gave him good advice.
what the hell wrong with you people?
I just became a legend like Willie Mays,
Stan Musial, and Carl Yastrzemski.
y'all gonna try to speak on something negative?
that's what I'm talkin' about. That's why I'm quittin'.
what? -What?
what do you mean, quitting?
quittin'. I'm done.
hangin' it up.
now that I got this, I ain't playin' no more.
and that means no more talking to you stank-ass reporters.
excuse me? -That's right.
I'm talking to you.
and I said "stank-ass.
why now with the Brewers still in the race?
couldn't you wait until after the season?
I'd have quit last season if I didn't think you were gonna try to block me from the Hall of Fame.
but it don't matter 'cause I got mine.
3000
like it or not, I'm a certified immortal.
and there ain't nothin' you sons of bitches can do about it.
nothin'.
announcer: Attention, all Milwaukee leprechauns.
Stan: Hey, all you Milwaukee leprechauns.
this is St. Patty's Day.
get your shamrock groove on at Stan Ross' Mr. 3000 Sports Bar,
Iocated on Peacock Street in Waukesha County.
we got 3, 000 different kind of beers.
we got Wild lrish Rose and anything that you might want.
but wait. There's more.
you want to get that heavy vibration from that special someone?
get your page on at 3000 Beeps.
get your hair dyed, fried, and laid to the side at 3000 Cuts.
knickknack patty-whack, get your dog a bone.
and get your woof on at 3000 Paws.
get your Szechuan feast on at 3000 Woks.
bring the whole family down to Mr. 3000 Shopping Center.
Stan: First year, I was 150 votes short.
come here.
second year, I was less than 50 and so on.
last year, I was just 4 votes away.
sportswriters hate me.
but my numbers don't lie.
I got 3, 000 up there, one for each one of my hits.
they gotta let me in.
it's my year, and everybody knows it.
what about him?
who's that?
you know who that is.
that's T-Rex Pennebaker.
best player on the Brewers.
T-Rex Pennebaker ain't nothin'.
I don't even know why you bother learning his name, especially what you got in front of you, a living legend.
a certified immortal.
and I know you don't know a lot of immortals.
[ laughs ] Hey, easy, old man.
old man?
what you mean is "aged," like U. S. D. A. beef.
it's what's for dinner.
not on my plate.
no? -No.
monstrous.
just ain't like the old days, huh, Boca?
Mnh-mnh.
Wow. -Spring training.
you can practically smell the grass, can't you?
can't say I can, man.
what, you don't miss it?
miss it?
Nah.
Nah.
Stan didn't make many friends when he was playing here.
he wasn't very good with the press.
we invited him to Old-timers' Day every year since he retired.
that's nine years.
and he never RSVP'd once.
he might not want to do this, you know what I'm saying?
no. What are you saying?
I'm just saying, "Stan Ross Day.
retire his number.
the fans, man.
did he go for it?
did you hit him with the fans bit?
how about where you say you didn't know if I would do it?
Boca, I swear, when you get to going, you can talk a stripe off a zebra.
monstrous.
man: And welcome to beautiful Miller Park.
ladies and gentlemen, we're here today to retire number 21, worn by one of the Brewers' all-time greats.
seven times an All-Star, a member of that exclusive 3, 000-base-hit club, the Wizard of Wood, the Count of Contact, and the King of the Swing,
Milwaukee's own Mr. 3000, Stan Ross!
Wow!
Damn!
I still look good.
he hasn't lost his touch, has he?
and joining us today to pay tribute to Stan,
Iet's welcome former teammate Bill "Big Horse" Berelli.
who?
I think he played with you a couple of months in '79.
he was a middle reliever.
what happened to Paul Molitor, man?
Robin Yount? Cecil Cooper? What happened to them?
they declined.
we're lucky we got him.
you know, a lot of people said that Stan only looked out for himself.
that he wasn't a team player.
but I'm here to tell you that if you get 3, 000 hits, you don't have to be a team player.
what?
if you have a lifetime . 314 average, you don't have to be a good guy.
if you lead the league in batting for three years, you can be the biggest jerk in the world.
he laughin', man. He laughin'.
so on behalf of all of us who played alongside of you, congratulations.
go on, go on, man. You can't help me now.
also here with us today, you remember him well, number 8, Anthony Carter.
all right, come on. Tell them like it is, Boca.
come on, baby. Now we're talkin'.
me and Stan were teammates.
man, could he hit the ball.
tell 'em, baby.
and I loved him for that.
I love you more.
that's it? I'm trying to get enshrined.
that's it? Man, y'all killin' me, man.
all right, Milwaukee,
Iet's hear it for our Brewers' own Stan Ross!
thank you so much.
first, I want to thank you, Mr. Schembri, and the entire Milwaukee Brewers organization.
and to my main man, my best friend, Boca Carter.
and to you, Old Donkey.
big Horse! -Whatever!
but most of all, I want to thank you-all.
the fans.
you were always there for me.
and I know for a fact, if it was up to you,
I'd have been in the Hall of Fame a long time ago.
but unfortunately, it's up to a bunch of sportswriters.
some metalhead half-asses.
how the hell do you bat 3, 000 and not be selected into the Hall of Fame?
what type of bullshit is that? -[ Feedback ]
let me tell you something.
you-all believed in me when I was at my best.
you-all believed in me when I was at my worst.
you, the fans!
[Cheering]
that's why I know for a fact
I can depend on you-all to bring me, Stan Ross, to Cooperstown.
I can hear you say "Stan!
crowd: Stan!
say "Stan Ross"!
Stan Ross!
Stan Ross!
Stan Ross!
he's the boss!
he's the boss!
say "Hall of Fame"!
hall of Fame!
it's a damn shame!
over here, say, "Hell, yeah"!
hell, yeah!
say, "Hell, yeah"!
hell, yeah!
say, "You're the man"!
you're the man!
let me hear it again!
you're the man!
they love me. -You're the man!
you got a minute?
hang on. What?
you know how when we think somebody's gonna be voted in, we run the numbers.
every win, every home run, every hit?
Yeah.
we were running that for Stan Ross.
a list of every one of his 3, 000 hits.
there's an error. -One of the hits was an error?
no, all the hits were hits. There just aren't 3, 000 of them.
okay. Start over.
okay, there was a game in May 1982 that was called for curfew.
when they finished in August, the hits were recorded twice.
once in May, once in August.
Stan Ross had three hits in that game.
that means that three of the hits don't count.
so you're telling me... -Stan Ross, Mr. 3000, -has only 2, 997 hits. -2, 997 hits.
as Yahko tried to escape across the rope bridge, he realized that he was trapped by both sides by the dreaded, evil boars.
Yahko knew his only hope was to do the unthinkable, and that was to jump far, far below into the raging, raging river.
hold on, kids.
Hello?
hey...
Hey, man, the press is eating it up.
what happens to Yahko?
shh, shh, shh, shh.
what happened to Yahko? -What?
what happened to Yahko? -What happened to Yahko?
shut up!
boy: I can't believe you said that.
man, that's bullshit!
Oh, Mr. Ross. -CHlLDREN: Ooh!
please, the children. -Man, hell with the kids!
Yahko's dead!
Scott: The Hall of Fame vote is in, and Stan Ross is not.
the always-controversial ex-Brewer had slowly crept to within four votes of enshrinement, but this time finished 147 votes shy, following a correction in the record books that left him three hits short of the magical 3, 000.
Stan's gonna wait -Turn it off.
till next year to wait till next life.
from the green...
I can't let them do it to me.
I can't let them take away my legacy.
# Watch me! #
# Watch me! #
# I got it #
# Watch me! #
# I got it. hey! #
you love me because I'm one of the greatest hitters alive.
# I got somethin' that tells me #
you love me because I'm one of the greatest hitters alive.
# I got soul. and I'm super bad #
you love me because I'm one of the greatest hitters alive.
# I got soul #
# And I'm super bad #
# I got it. hey! #
I'm back!
the King with the Swing, the right arm they call "The Gun,
Stan Ross.
nitroglycerin himself.
number 21, the man with sweetest swing in the major league, is back.
[ slurring ] You gotta be joking.
how old are you?
47 and getting younger.
that's why I love you, man.
man, what the hell? What's your damn problem, man?
that was 4/10 of a second.
that's how much time you have after the ball leaves the pitcher's hand to decide whether it's a fastball, a split-finger.
wait, wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
what you know about the game? You played in the majors?
figures. He's drunk.
no, I've just been a Brewers fan my whole life while you treated the team and the fans and the city like dirt.
yo, Boca, get this man another bottle.
thank you. -You're welcome.
I want you to try it again. -What?
cause last time I wasn't standing at the plate.
come on, try it again.
Yeah.
Boca. See that?
three more of these.
three more hits.
as I said before, Stan Ross is back.
better talk to him, Boca.
ladies and gentlemen, number 21, the great, the fantastic,
Mr. Incredible.
Stan.
man: I thought when we retired his number, we wouldn't have to see that prick anymore.
man #2: He's a senior citizen. Do you think I want him here?
and he hasn't played the game in nine years.
it's not like we're in the American League anymore, so he's gotta play the field.
can he even handle first base at his age, let alone hit?
fellas.
we are in fifth place, and we are not drawing flies.
and we've got two very long months ahead of us.
the biggest crowd we've had all year was the day we retired Stan's number.
now, we give him a physical.
give him a month to get in shape.
then after that September roster expansion, if he's up to it, we put him in the lineup.
Bo, all I need is a bat.
that's it, baby.
look at him.
he ain't got no waist on him. He got nothin'.
Stan Ross. -Hey.
Eddie Richling. I'm the conditioning coach.
he here to carry you home?
the only thing Boca gonna carry is my plaque.
that's why I love you. -I love you more.
is that right? How many push-ups can you do?
one arm or two?
well, I'll tell you what, last time I counted, what was it, about 40, 50?
I got 5 bucks in my pocket says you can't give me 10.
that's easy money. Back up, man.
you better help your boy down. -He didn't help me in.
come on, let's see what you got.
okay, well, that's one.
how many is that?
Oh, I don't know. I'd say 40, 50.
that's four.
come on, Stan. You got this one.
Oh, oh! Your knee touched, man.
that's a girl push-up. -You see my knee touch?
well, it might have, yeah.
but who said girl push-ups don't count?
Yeah, who said girl push-ups don't count?
how you want to pay me, cash or check?
Oh, look at them arms starting to shake.
come on.
come on.
Aah! Oof!
okay, Stan, now you ready to get started for real?
man, what type of shit is this?
hydrostatic weighing.
it's how we determine how much body fat you really have.
I don't need my balls washed to tell you how much I weigh.
hold your breath, Stan.
this ain't nothin' but a Southern baptism.
it's called modern technology, Stan.
recently, the Brewers have incorporated new methods of training into their exercise regimen.
we're gonna get you started on this bad boy.
look at this. -Mm-hmm.
this looks like some punishment.
actually, it's very gentle.
it's called Pilates.
Pi-what?
breathe in.
okay, feel the extensors now.
I feel like Flipper.
B, that's what I'm talkin' about.
I'm gonna start off real light, about 463.
you can throw 463 on if you want to, chicken chest, but your equipment is right over there.
remember what I told you. Keep that ass up.
all right, push!
whoa, where you going?
is this a joke?
it's only a joke if you think weak abs are funny.
feel it in your lats?
you ask me about my lats. Yeah, I feel it.
my spine and my butt, too.
push it! Push it! Push it!
come on! -Aah!
# It's fun to stay at the Y. M. C. A. #
# It's fun to stay at the Y. M. C. A. #
# They have everything for young men to enjoy #
# You can hang out with all the boys #
whoa, where you going? Get back here.
# It's fun to stay at the Y. M. C. A. #
Whoo! Yeah!
# You can get yourself clean. you can have a good meal #
# You can do whatever you feel #
stand up.
sit down.
come on, now up.
look at this boy go. Look at your boy.
what's your name? -Stan Ross.
tell 'em your name. -Stan Ross.
who are you? -Stan Ross!
Louder! -They call me the boss.
who? -'Cause I pay the cost.
Why? -'Cause I'm Stan Ross!
# You can get yourself clean. you can have a good meal #
# You can do whatever... #
so, tomorrow, man, you ready?
game's changed a lot since we last played.
I still see the ball. I still hit the ball.
all day.
but I do miss playin'.
I know I always said I didn't, but I do.
ain't nothin' like hittin' in the major leagues.
bein' a part of that great tradition.
I never felt that type of respect that I felt on the ball field.
that kind of attention.
Oh, shoot, that reminds me.
you got a call this afternoon.
some ad-agency guy from New York.
endorsement?
was it Reebok?
it's not Reebok.
adidas or Nike?
Viagra.
what?
Viagra, man. You'd be the spokesman.
I ain't gonna be no damn spokesman for no Viagra.
I can still swing my bat, Bo.
SCHEMBRl: Are we ready to roll here?
okay, the Milwaukee Brewers are pleased to be able to help a member of the Brewer family reclaim his rightful place in baseball history.
so it is with great pride that I introduce to you the once and future Mr. 3000, Stan Ross.
thank you.
thank you, Mr. Schembri, and the Milwaukee Brewers organization.
and I promise, it won't be like last time when I'm in front of the microphone with all that cussin' and shit, you know?
Hey, Stan. -Yes?
is this only about getting back to 3, 000 hits, or do you believe you can help make the Brewers more competitive on the field?
how could I not make them more competitive?
let me be a little polite here.
the Milwaukee Brewers are weak.
man: Here we go. -Who they got?
they're a Little League team. You all know it. They need me.
how do you think you'll adjust to the contemporary game?
you ever heard of Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes?
earth, Wind & Fire?
some things just always play well.
a little "old school" is what this team needs.
you nervous? -What if you don't hit?
what's that?
I said, "What if you don't hit?
if all this talk is just talk and it becomes obvious you're hurting the team, will you take yourself out of the lineup?
I said I'm gonna hit.
when I say I'm gonna do something, I do it.
that's not always how it works.
well, it is for me.
not the way I remember.
maybe you remember something you thought I said I was gonna do, but didn't say I was gonna do it, 'cause I cold-blood do everything I say I'm gonna do.
[ laughs ] Is that the way you were raised?
straight up and down, like 6: 00.
so what does your mama think about this comeback foolishness?
why are we getting on this Mama stuff?
okay, that's it for today, folks.
thank you very much.
man: Just get one more question.
get in line.
you really nailed him on that one.
Maureen.
Hey.
what you doing here?
what do you think? I'm covering the story for ESPN.
Uh-huh. Why you, though?
[ scoffs ] They sent me.
just by chance, you ain't here to see me?
no, I'm on assignment.
they asked me to cover a story, so I'm covering it, period.
I'll see you at the ball park.
Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo. Wait, wait.
how about an exclusive?
see?
you and me?
huh? [ Laughing ]
you think you'll get three hits in your first three at-bats and get this thing over with?
come on, Mo, I'm 47 years old.
it'll probably take me maybe four at-bats.
you're one of a kind, Stan Ross. Thank you for sitting with us.
good luck tonight.
thank you.
that's it. Thanks, guys. That's a wrap.
that wasn't too bad, was it? -That was great.
after I get my hits today, you want to come by and celebrate?
you know, you better keep your mind on the game, Mr. 3000.
you thinkin', eh?
well, we'll see in a few hours, won't we?
Stan, you da man.
livin' legend, baby.
Yes, sir, all you got to do is walk up in there and take those youngsters to school.
Hey, oh, good. Buddy, come here.
help me out, please, with the zipper.
Hey, can you give me a hand? -You best mean a handshake.
wait a minute. You're Stan Ross.
Stan! Stan! Huge fan. You gotta help me out.
you gotta unzip me.
I'm gonna tell my buddies. "Stan Ross unzipped my pants.
you crazy.
Oh, crazy? Thinkin' I'm crazy?
where is he? Stan, Stan, Stan, Stan.
let me tell you something. I am crazy!
crazy for asking you to give me a hand!
woman: Yeah, good luck on tonight's game.
now, this shit is all right.
Uh-huh, sound effects could be a little bit louder when a brother hit.
that shit should sound like a cannon!
Mr. Ross.
I'm Rick, the clubhouse assistant.
just Stan. I'm just Stan.
all right. That's your locker over there.
man ON TELEVlSlON: The Arizona Diamondbacks and the Milwaukee Brewers.
go ahead, man, it's in my locker.
I'm Stan Ross. -I know very well who you are.
I grew up watching your excellent play on television.
you are hero to many young Japanese players.
but you have hole in your ass.
hole in my ass?
what's his problem? -That's Fukuda.
he was taught English in school in Japan, but they never taught him to cuss worth a damn.
but why he cuss me out? I never did nothin' to him.
brother, you're looking at 25 Little Leaguers in here who want to give you an ass-whupping.
Oh, 6-3! 6-3, man!
you're right, 6-4. I was trying to cheat.
Minadeo, Skillett. Second and short.
they'll go at it over anything.
what are you talking about? No! That's half out.
lt all got to be in. -lt half went in.
it has to go in, all of it.
you're always trying to pull this.
what do you say, Grandpa? Does that count?
grandpa?
man: Here it is. -Uh-oh. Lineup!
base hit, dinner's on me.
Ah, yes! Now batting leadoff.
skills that pay the bills. [ Laughs ]
Whoo!
was Panas here yet back when you were playing?
Yeah, he was here.
I don't think I was one of his favorites.
Stan Ross, you bat eighth! Ha ha!
eighth? That's for banjo hitters.
man, I never batted lower than fifth in my life.
you bat that now, you son of my dick.
son of my dick?
Hey, what size you swinging over there, Old School?
34 ounce, like I always have.
you sure you can still get around with that at your age?
don't you worry about me.
I've been swinging this thing sweet before you knew which side of the bat was the good end.
Whoo!
Yeah, I swing a 36 myself.
Yeah, that's big talk.
I got a hammer my damn self.
Whew.
come on, Coach.
man: Ross, you suck!
how's it feel, Stan?
how about an interview after the game?
come on, now, don't distract me when I'm hittin'.
hitting's my business.
that's what I'm talkin' about. -Lookin' good, Stan.
man: Stan! Still the Wizard of Wood!
bingo.
Oh, yeah.
I'm about to take care of business.
crowd: Charge!
charge!
charge!
announcer: Bottom of the third, and the cheers you hear, and the boos, for that matter, are for Stan Ross.
it's the reason most of the 38, 000-plus fans are here tonight.
man ON P. A. First baseman, number 21, Stan Ross.
this guy throws pretty hard, Pops.
is that right?
well, I hit pretty hard, son.
strike one.
come on, Stan.
be aggressive.
I am.
stay focused. Keep your eye on the ball.
I'm looking dead at it.
I don't need you to tell me what to do.
come on in.
I've been here before.
this ain't my first picnic, baby.
Ooh, Stan was a hair off timing that big breaking ball from Hamilton.
of course, all season, a lot of hitters, who aren't 47 years old, have been fooled by Hamilton.
and we're the Little Leaguers?
not so aggressive, baby.
Whew. Focus.
he playin' to you.
let him play to you, baby. Come on.
come on, Stan.
come on, baby.
strike!
announcer: lnside fastball, and Stan Ross is out of there on three straight pitches.
it looks like it could be a long night for the King of Swing.
what up? Welcome to "SportsCenter.
Stuart Scott with you. We got some more baseball.
braves at Brewers. [ Chuckles ]
who cares?
well, Stan Ross cares.
the first week at bat was a lot like the first week out of the womb for Stan.
a lot of drooling and a lot of just flailing around for the erstwhile King of Swing.
let's check out the highlights.
well, Stan the man more like Stan the statue, just chillin' at a curve for strike one.
next pitch. Now, wait a second.
what was it that Stan said about the rest of his team?
the Milwaukee Brewers are weak.
who they got?
they're a Little League team.
they need me.
Uh-huh. Little Leaguers, huh?
well, my 9-year-old has a better swing and better eyes than that.
Oh! Just chillin' at a called strike three, and, well, that'll get you some halitosis action.
Yeah, when you get just a little too close to the umpire.
Stan's not done. He decided to do a little spring cleaning.
either that, or he just wants to symbolize how well he's been playing.
Yeah, garbage!
now, I'm not gonna say that every Brewer but Stan had a hit, but I am gonna say that every Brewer but Stan that played had a hit.
our Maureen Simmons was at the game and had postgame duty.
not the day Stan Ross or the Milwaukee fans had in mind.
word around the organization is that manager Gus Panas is particularly unhappy having Ross back in the lineup.
apparently he hasn't forgotten the way Stan abandoned the team in the middle of the pennant race nine years ago.
Stuart.
the press is having a field day.
Hey, they're just getting even with Stan for all those years of abuse.
for turning this team into a laughingstock.
five games and hasn't gotten close to a hit.
how long do we let this go on?
we got 35, 000 people in the park today.
we're committed to this.
whether Stan Ross ever gets another hit or not.
you sure you don't want anything stronger than club soda?
Oh, no, I'm good.
Thanks, Boca.
why you call him Boca?
look at him.
he look like he's ready for Boca Raton with them tracksuits.
Stan don't appreciate my velour.
that's all he wears.
Mo, I swear, he has a black one for funerals.
just comin' from me, I think my man take his old Reebok endorsement deal a little too serious.
Hey, a lifetime supply. -That's why I love you.
no, that's why I love you. -No, I love you more.
no, I love you more.
no, no, I started the love.
and your life's been richer ever since.
I hear you.
nice to see you again, Mo.
mm, you too, Tony.
so, you hire a fancy decorator to help you do this place?
girl, you need to quit fightin'.
you know doggone well you thought I was gonna be old and tired when I quit the game.
I never thought about it. -You thought it.
but I got news for you.
I own this place, and I own all the stores next door.
3000 Suds, 3000 Woks, and 3000 Beeps.
that's why you're comin' back. So all them names make sense.
sister, you know why I'm comin' back.
cause I deserve to be in the Hall of Fame with the immortals.
you know, you really shouldn't word it like that.
ls that right? -Mm-hmm.
what? -Oh, you know what.
you better hush.
you eatin' that steak. Let me see something.
come here. Flex. -Mnh-mnh.
Mo, Mo, baby, look at you. Come on, Mo.
look at you, Mo.
oho!
and quick still.
you gonna eat this?
you sure got time to eat.
baby, you hungrier than a hostage.
Ooh, take a bite out of crime.
that killed me there, I'll tell ya.
I thought the lady must have...
wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.
you don't train no more. You don't drink no more.
what's up with that?
cause I remember you used to drink half the American League underneath the table.
I realized I had to start cuttin' loose from those things that weren't getting me anywhere.
where you need to be gettin'? -On with my life.
we don't stay young forever.
come on. You know we're young enough.
Ooh, I don't think so, Mr. Ross.
come on, I know you remember what it was like.
you can't say we didn't have something special.
good night.
what about Kansas City? That was a mind-blowing weekend.
you mean to tell me you forgot about that?
Bye-bye.
Cleveland, when I had your toenails poppin' off like Redenbacher.
Bye. -Come on, how about Toronto?
God.
Uh-huh. -Oh.
come on, say it. -Come on, now.
you know I didn't expect you in Toronto.
you know how those Canadian groupies are.
come on, now. -You know what?
don't give me that crap.
you're a selfish man. You always were.
okay, if you so upset, why was you willing to get back with me?
we got together for a night, but I didn't stay for breakfast, did l?
we'd still be doin' it if you didn't take that ESPN gig.
when there's a better offer on the table, you gotta take it.
I'll pay for it.
Bye-bye. -[ Tires screech ]
announcer: The count is 1-1 on the second baseman Minadeo.
brewers down by 4.
runner at first.
they sure could use a little spark here.
glickman now on the mound, working from the stretch.
throws to first and picked him off.
Skillett is caught napping.
when is this ball club going to wake up?
another mistake.
Minadeo steps back in.
here's the wind and the pitch.
swung on, a one-hopper back to the mound.
he bobbles it, but what's Minadeo doing?
he's not running. Now they pick it up.
the throw to first, and he's out.
Aah! -Come on!
Stan: Look at that.
there should be a man on first and second right now.
but easy, Gus. Don't get excited.
I don't want you to pop no blood vessel.
what you-all havin', prayer?
announcer: The only shining star on the team these days is their strapping young outfielder, T-Rex Pennebaker.
but even his impressive power numbers have done little to stop the Brewers' losing streak.
Pennebaker digs in.
and here's the windup and the pitch.
swung on and a deep, deep drive to left field.
it's going, going.
it is gone!
4-1.
yet another bases-empty home run for T-Rex Pennebaker.
what the hell is that?
that right there?
that's a little somethin' for "SportsCenter.
Plus, that's gonna look tight in next year's video game.
what the hell you call yourself doin'?
yo, I'm puttin' the show in the show.
but your team losin'.
instead of playin', you makin' like Mr. Bojangles.
I just hit a home run, son.
maybe you was takin' a grandpa nap during that part.
but your team gettin' picked off.
your boys ain't beatin' out grounders.
there should've been two men on when you hit that homer.
it should be a ball game right now.
so yell at them, Old School.
get up out of my face. I did my job.
you the superstar.
you set the tone.
listen here.
when you get a base hit in this millennium, then you can come on down there and talk to me.
is that right?
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, Stan, you think that diaper's affecting your swing?
maybe you should use something lighter.
how about a Wiffle bat? [ Laughs ]
how 'bout I shove my Hall of Fame bat up the crack of your mascot ass?
make you a hot dog on a stick, bitch.
yeah? I might be a sausage with teeth, but you sure as hell ain't no Hall of Famer.
# If you disrespect # -What?
# Everybody that you run into #
Stan: Looks familiar?
familiar?
you ain't changed nothin' since back in the day.
in fact, I don't think you even vacuumed.
well, why mess with perfection?
Oh, I can think of a lot of descriptions for this couch, and "perfection" ain't one of 'em.
what's the deal there?
how come I hardly see you on "SportsCenter" anymore?
you know.
they got some pretty young thing they tryin' to groom.
that's bull. They can't treat you like that.
I remember once upon a time I pushed out the 40-year-old.
I been playin' this game long enough to know how it goes.
but I've been lookin' ahead toward it, you know?
I'm gonna start producing next year.
I'm goin' behind the camera. -Oh, you go, girl.
like I've been telling you, you can't beat Father Time.
well, how come you really haven't settled down?
the right man wasn't right.
[ Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" plays ]
# I've been really trying. baby #
what's the matter with you?
that's my song.
# Trying to hold back this feeling for so long #
come on, bump with me. Don't leave me hangin'.
come on. I need you, now.
don't leave me hangin'. Come on.
come on. Come on out here.
all right, only 'cause I like this song, too.
not 'cause I like you. -I'll take it.
# Whoo. Iet's get it on # -Come on.
# Oh. baby #
# Let's get it on #
Hey. - # Let's love. baby #
# Let's get it on # -[ Chuckles ]

# Sugar #
# Let's get it on # -Still got it.
Stan. -Yeah, baby?
honey, stop chasing the butt.
you know what, Mo?
the best sex I ever had was with you.
what? -Yeah.
you had girls in every city in baseball.
it wasn't the best.
why is that? We do it longer?
not really.
more positions, then?
I ain't goin' there.
Mm-hmm.
more times a night?
Oh, you still hold the record.
I don't know, baby. I guess I like the rest of it.
the rest of it? What's left?
well, you know.
I like the sleepin' and the talkin'
and hangin' out and stuff like that.
# Giving yourself to me #
# Can never be wrong # -But that's not sex.
it is to me.
no, it's not sex.
what you call that, then?
# Ooh-ooh #
# Now. don't you know #
# How sweet and wonderful life can be? #
# Ooh-ooh #
# I'm asking you #
before we go too far, I can't spend the night.
why not? -Early flight.
where you got to go?
I got three games before we go on the road.
but I got to get back. -You got to get...
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
are you givin' up on me, Mo?
what you got to say? -I don't have a say.
I just go where I'm assigned.
you tell 'em I'm startin' to swing the bat good again?
I'm just a reporter.
I don't make the news or decide what is the news.
you're givin' up on me, too. -Mnh-mnh.
you just got to make the news, baby.
start hittin' that ball. -Come on.
what? -Come on.
you want to go up? Stay down? What?
no.
I'm not in the mood right now.
you...
you're kiddin'. You're not in the mood?
no. -Oh, come on, baby.
no, I got a headache.
Really? You gonna tell me you got cramps, too?
maybe.
you know...
whatever.
all right, now. I'm leavin'.
Lord, just when I thought I'd seen it all.
t-rex: When you get a base hit in this millennium, then you can come on down...
Stan: I can still swing my bat.
MO: You think you'll get three hits in your first three at-bats?
Scott: More like Stan the statue.
t-rex: When you get a base hit...
MO: You just got to make the news, baby.
start hittin' that ball.
man: One, two, three strikes, you're out!
Oh, bat boy.
Ooh, ooh, a little testy. A little testy.
anybody have a Stan Ross rookie card?
quite valuable.
if you look on the back, you'll see it's written in Latin.
you see, very old.
very old card. It's on parchment.
[ channel changes ] -He's now 0-27 in his comeback.
at what point, Peter, does the rust come off?
I'm not sure it does.
remember, Jim Palmer tried to come back after he was in the Hall of Fame, and he kept himself in better shape than Ross.
why does the media hate this guy so much?
he's a jerk.
because T-Rex is the best in power and performance.
find it at Radio Shack.
radio Shack. You've got questions.
we've got answers.
cause I want my hits that got stolen from me.
those hits are my ticket to the Hall of Fame.
he's not going to the Hall of Fame!
you think three hits are keeping you out?
3, 000 hits, baby, it's automatic.
look at me.
you're 47 years old. You're fat. You're out of shape.
favorite portion of the show, the comedy portion.
I'm gonna say it here, the woman that puts on the sausage outfit that races around Miller Park has got a better chance of getting a hit than Stan Ross.
[ audience jeering ] -That's not fair, Tom.
he's a black athlete.
black athletes age slower.
george Foreman didn't know when to get out.
Mike Tyson didn't know when to get out.
michael Jordan struggled, and he was only out two years.
this guy hasn't played since I was married to my first wife.
it just isn't possible to get out of his day.
he's a bad teammate.
Stan Ross was a great athlete. -Stan is all about Stan.
the Brewers knew what they were getting into.
it's a publicity stunt, just like when the White Sox hired that midget.
Tom, you can't say "midget.
he's small. That guy was small for a friggin' midget.
it's like if the Red Sox thawed out Ted Williams, although he'd hit better than Stan.
listen, Stan's playing like he's frozen.
Stan is embarrassing. He's embarrassing me.
he's embarrassing him. He should give it up.
but when an athlete gets to that point, he loses all his pride.
Yeah, you're making me cry. I don't think he's embarrassed.
I think he's having a party at his place, got bitches all around and counting all his money.
I don't think Stan cares.
man: Wrong! He's embarrassed.
he used to be able to hit, cannot hit now.
SALLEY: Very embarrassing, especially with all the bitches he got around.
Hey, Boca.
you think I should quit?
do your thing, man.
you think?
I'm just saying.
Yeah, you're right.
I got three home games against the Astros before we go on the road.
I'm gonna play those games, and that's it.
if I don't get a hit, it's over.
I'm not goin' on the road.
what you think, Boca?
do your thing, man.
you think?
I'm just saying.
Yeah.
you're right.
you want to get married?
you the only one that love me. I'm serious.
I've been waitin' 20 years for you to ask me that.
and now that you have, I don't know.
Yeah, you right.

Kazik. Kazik, speak to me.
let's get out of here!
go to your side! Go to the Ghetto.
officer, I am a veteran of the Polish armed services.
then you're a fighter, huh?
mordechai Anielewicz? You're wanted for work detail. Let's go.
work detail? Where? - Who knows? What's the difference?
all Jews, ordered to report.
how will I know what to wear? - Don't get smart.
let's get moving.
this work detail, it wouldn't be a German work detail?
I warned you.
I only work for my people. - Move!
you, a Jewish policeman, are a traitor to your people. I should kill you!
but often I ask myself: Can a moral man, that's me, maintain his moral code in an immoral world?
does this question interest you?
get out of here, before I hurt you.
Papa, why are so many people moving here?
just be glad you've got the bread, Tosia.
what now?
please, stop. Stop! - Let go.
they create a Jewish police force to do their dirty work...
...unless they feel like having fun.
of course, divide and conquer.
what is next?
what are you doing with this car? - Driving.
did you steal it? - Now, Mordechai...
why steal what I can have for free? - What are you up to?
I am the official driver for Adam Czerniakow.
head of the Jewish Council?
that's who I'm here to pick up.
help us set up a meeting with him.
if I did that, I'd put my position at risk.
if you don't, you help the Germans. This doesn't worry you?
I'd worry more if I couldn't feed my family.
never mind about the Jewish police. Or how we school the children.
we all have families.
we don't want him to lose his job.
I wish you well.
Mira's contacted sympathizers at the border.
they might be able to get some of our students out of Poland.
but it has to be now. What do you think?
if you can get them to Palestine,do it before the opportunity is lost.
I think you're right.
wish me luck. - Luck.
you're taking them illegally.
all Jewish men, 12 to 60, are to perform forced labor.
but their documents! - And you are...?
zuckerman, their teacher. Look at these!
they're exempt from forced labor. - They are, aren't they?
today everyone works, Zuckerman.
see that Zuckerman gets the opportunity to work as well!
we understand we might be leaving for Palestine.
I have to leave. But I hope to return soon and address this rumor.
okay, who remembers today's topic? Anybody?
help me out because I forgot to write it down.
something about morality. - Yes, Frania.
can a moral man maintain his moral code in an immoral world?
very good. Okay, Julian?
you can work with that topic? - Sure.
good.
okay. Today's topic:
can an immoral man maintain his moral code on a first date?
so everything is arranged until you get to the border.
still, you'll have to get across on your own.
And?
and if you find a safe passage... - Yes?
if you find a safe passage and return safely, then you will get a reward.
what kind of a reward?
perhaps the fulfillment of your dreams.
seeing your students make the desert bloom and become fertile.
that's it?
it's a lot of work. The danger alone is...
all right. Well, perhaps the eternal gratitude of your people.
and of a certain person in particular.
who? - Someone very close to you.
what kind of gratitude?
what if I find two safe passages?
you can take off your armband now.
go.
now, be careful, Tosia.
get down to the stream and follow it. Over there is the border.
is it very far? - No.
you should reach a safe house before night. They're aware of your journey.
I will receive my payment now.
thank you very much. - Good luck to you.
see if you can pull around them.
so, Kazik, how did you get this assignment, driving my car?
your other driver was taken to slave labor.
And? - And I was chosen to replace him.
Kazik. - Yes, sir?
do not steal the car.
Yes, sir.

about the hostages taken to Pawiak.

about the other matter...

...all because a Polish police officer was roughed up.

...make sure they do so by 6 p. m. Tomorrow.
you should get busy.
stop.
what are you hiding there?
smells good.
be better with jam, but... Try it.
get out of here.
my father's sick. He needs it badly. - How badly?
please.
now get out of here.
Tosia, come.
are you all right, Mama? - I'm fine.
it's too dangerous to go out like you do.
Hello, dear.
go, Rachel. - Papa?
we're going to sell a few books. We'll try and keep your favorites.
I think we need more.
do you want another blanket?
I won't allow you. Do you hear me?
I'm going to keep your favorites and I'll bring back bread.
your mother thinks I don't know she's sewing for a rich woman. I do.
make sure she's careful on the streets.
it's so dangerous.
promise me you won't tell her I know.
I promise. - We have to hurry, Rachel.
I promise, Papa.
be careful on the other side.
I will be, Papa. I will.
now light the Shabbes candles.
sorry I'm late.
you heard about the ransom demand? - It's a terrible situation.
we must ask your men to speak to the relatives of the hostages.
see what they can contribute. - How much time do we have?
tomorrow night, 6: 00.
for 38 years, this is on my hand.
here.
put it in the envelope, Mrs. Rochon.
will you get my David back?
he's a good boy.
they have no business taking him.
you are a good boy too.
your mother must be proud, Calel. - Good day.
captain Szerynski, this is the ring you wanted to see.
this is the money from Captain Szerynski's men.
this is all you received? - Yes.
and you've counted it twice? - No.
three times.
they're short. - I know.
they're 80, 000 zlotys short. - I know!
it's 4: 00. Why didn't Szerynski call? - He said he's doing his best.
get me Rabbi Lebowicz.
come, Rabbi. Please.
excuse me, but a rabbi should not go into an establishment of such ill repute.
Mr. Asher, in the Jewish faith, it's customary we demonstrate our love of God through our good deeds.
it is true.
and in this manner...
...God is able to bestow his great blessings upon us.
also true.
I believe today you have a special opportunity to demonstrate your love of God should you wish to do so.
preferably before 6 p. m.
Mr. Czerniakow, I wish to thank you for affording me this special opportunity to receive God's blessing.
should you ever bring a rabbi here again...
if you pull a stunt like this again, I'll kill you.
make no mistake about it.
commissar Auerswald!
he is not here. - He must be.
there's a deadline for the hostages, 6: 00.
he was called to Berlin for important meetings.
then who's in charge? - Do not stand so close to my desk.
who is...? - I'm asking you...
who is in charge?
I'm here to pay the full fine.
I know nothing about this. He left no instructions.
someone must. Who's handling this? - Step back from the desk!
I do not wish your diseases. - This is the payment.
call Pawiak. Tell them it's been delivered.
did you say Pawiak? - Pawiak prison, yes. 23 hostages.
I saw a notice on Pawiak. Here it is.
on the authority of the commissar's office, 23 prisoners were executed at 10 this morning for crimes against the Polish people.
no.
these were not crimes. There were no crimes.
these were innocent people. There were children!
you are with child. Did you know there were children?
I know nothing about this situation.
if you wish to discuss this, the commissar will return Tuesday.
have you no connection? - I have answered your questions.
you are free to go now.
this morning at 10: 00...
...the 23 hostages...
...were executed...
...By order of the commissar's office.
I am very sorry.
how long have you been here? Six months?
so you still don't want to tell me who your comrades are, huh?
maybe I can be more convincing.
very convincing.
we've had 4000 deaths by starvation and typhus. - The population is 450, 000.
they're rationing calories.
we're calculating 2613 for German nationals...
...699 for Poles and 184 for Jews.
Auerswald's ordered the council to pay all costs...
...labor and material for this Ghetto wall.
I want you all to know I do not believe our situation...
I do not believe it to be hopeless.
I believe that if we remain strong and active that somehow, some sense of reason will return. That's it.
we must persevere.
wait!
let me see what's in your coat!
I don't have bread. - I see it!
I don't! Leave me alone! - I have money.
No! You have to give me the bread.
Ah, Yitzhak.
you look like crap. - Danke.
but you were never good-looking to begin with.
don't worry. He'll survive.
yitzhak, I brought you a little something.
a gift from my travels.
the first of many, I hope.
here.
in case you run into trouble again.
we'll put a stop to this, yes?
we've begun bringing factions into one underground organization.
and the Bund, are they with us? - They're still unconvinced.
we have so much to do and so little time.
we've organized underground kitchens, schools and hospitals.
it's our own little society. It's just surrounded by a brick wall.
what about...? - No.
I have been unable to get you a meeting with Czerniakow. He refuses.
he refuses.
I don't see him. Do you?
his car is there.
over there with Szerynski and that pest, Calel. He'll be here.
so, what made you give up your fancy car and join the Resistance?
there's no better way to meet women. Under these circumstances.
always the idealist, huh?
there he is.
sir?
so you refuse to meet my friend.
tell me, my recently departed driver...
...whom am I refusing to meet?
Ringleblum's friend, who has an interest in history.
and in protecting our people.
and you think writing up flyers and underground meetings and preparing resistance will accomplish this?
it's not all I propose. We must strike back any way we can.
and the German "collective responsibility"?
you are proposing to spit at them. They'll retaliate against innocents even harder than they did last time.
they suffer anyway. They die of disease, starvation and worse...
...and you negotiate as if Germans are reasonable?
Yes, I do. I try to minimize the harm. - So do we!
please, give us a chance. Give us support to get started.
yours is a romantic notion that will get you all killed.
and I will not support them. I will not.
and you should be wearing a hat. In this weather you can get pneumonia.
good day.
plie and stretch.
Releve, down.
grand plie...
grand plie...
they're gone.
it's clear.
they're gone.
so you talked to Czerniakow?
what did he say? - He won't support us now.
what about later? - We're going to be more persuasive.
perhaps we can rendezvous tonight and discuss your views more fully.
we must talk about many things. We must find women couriers who can pass as Gentiles and work on the Aryan side.
why not men who can pass? - Clara.
men do not fare as well in a strip search.
circumcision.
I know you think it's dangerous, but I have some bread for you.
look.
I have bread for you!
the children marching Sun themselves, one, two, three
you're okay here?
Yes.
because you can stay with me. You know this? It's fine with me.
you feel safer here, don't you?
Yes. On the street, I'm afraid.
and if you were to be taken, I would be alone.
you've been thinking about this. Okay.
go to class. Go.
Tosia, is this the child? - Yes.
you found her near the cemetery? - Correct.
and lack the resources to care for her?
I have nothing.
this child is not well.
Mrs. Linder, can we afford to take another child?
we cannot.
we cannot take another child.
but then, we have no choice, do we?
I want you to meet my family. - Yes.
my wife, Elza. - Pleasure, madame.
this is Calel Wasser, one of our finest young officers.
and this is our daughter, Inka.
we'll let you two get acquainted.
we have reports of mass killings in the village where your parents live.
no one survived.
and the rumor the Gestapo's offered you a certificate to Palestine?
it is not a rumor. It is the truth.
I refused.
thank you for your help raising money for us.
I wish I could do more for the children.
then, by all means do more.
do not lose your temper. Let me do the talking.
you do it.
Mr. Chairman? You have received our latest request?
I have. You want to buy arms. - And the council?
they're aware. - And?
you want to buy guns. And then what?
jewish honor.
jewish honor.
a father who's hiding his son is not honorable.
a rabbi who is teaching a child his lessons is not honorable.
a mother taking care of her children and many more, she is not either.
no. For you, honor can only come out of the barrel of a gun.
you talk about Jewish honor. I talk about Jewish responsibility.
call it what you like. Will the council support the Resistance?
no, they will actively oppose it.
what? You've heard of the mass killings!
not rumors, but facts from our own people.
outside Chelmno, thousands of Jews were taken in sealed vans with hoses pumping gas into them.
I know this because my parents were among them.
instead of opposing them, you'd leave our people's fate in their hands.
mothers protected their children from the gas.
when they were found alive...
...the Germans swung them against trees to kill them. Graphic enough?
that's not the point. - That is!
then let's just salute.
salute?
salute what? - Your followers. Your foot soldiers.
my what?
they're all over there. In the parade.
that's your honor, chairman.
Halt!
Halt!
Halt!
this is an illegal gathering!
you're to return to your homes immediately.
is this really necessary?
I struggle to find why our recital is injurious to the Third Reich.
that concludes today's program.
please join us tomorrow for a very special salute to Richard Wagner. Good evening.
Jew!
play something for us. - We've been instructed to go home.
I instruct you now.
play something.
you. Play something.
Kazik, grab the guns.
I'm sorry about your friend.
what were you doing? - Avenging a murder.
they'll retaliate! - They do what they want anyway.
this isn't a responsible organization! - Then we're not one.
no, you! You mustn't act impulsively! We must plan every action!
I'm sick of watching, waiting, of standing by, being passive!
I won't do it anymore! - We are not passive!
prudent in our actions.
we need to get weapons from the Polish underground. Arie needs help.
you'll look after my sister? - I will look after Gina. Go.
move!
what is this?
you are Czerniakow, chairman of the council?
I'm Dr. Fritz Hippler, with the Public Information Office.
under Goebbels, we're documenting Ghetto life.
we wish you to participate.
what do you wish me to do? - Conduct business as you would.
what is this? - This makes the picture look good.
I would not have that.
good. Now, I want you people to talk and conduct business as you would on any normal day.
have a seat.
are we ready? - Yeah.
and roll camera. And begin.
begin talking.
Adam. - Yes, Nathan.
are you aware there's a rather large candelabra on your desk?
Yes, I'm aware.
keep talking.
and that wax is dripping on your work?
Yes, I see that.
then why would you have it on your desk...
...if it drips on your work?
I have it, Nathan, because it is good for the picture.
stop. Stop. Stop.
just a moment, please. - Excuse me.
the lighting is all wrong. Look.
he has a good Hebrew nose, and I can't see it.
commissar Auerswald, there is talk about deportations and the putting to death of people in the camps.
just talk. Rumors.
I can assure you, no truth to them whatsoever.
places, people!
please?
would you sit down, please, in your chair? Can we see that?
Yes, that's much better.
there's one thing, though.
you're all being very still. Too still.
jews move their hands when they talk. So move your hands more, yes?
let me see that.
like this. Bigger.
and you?
very good. Yes, that's...
something like that. Good. All right.
roll camera and begin talking.
and use your hands.
Adam. - What?
are you aware there's a candelabra on your desk?
Yes, Nathan.
you can rest assured I am fully aware of all that is transpiring.
an essential trait of the Jew is that he always tries to hide his origin when among non-Jews.
people!
I want you to work faster.
wherever rats turn up...
...they carry destruction to the land and spread diseases...
...just as the Jews do among mankind.
this is a conspiracy against all non-Jews...
...By a sick, deceitful, poisoned race...
...against the Aryan peoples and their moral laws.
thank you, Marek. - Enjoy your work, but do it faster!
remember:
work will make you free.
come on, Sarah.
for you, two work permits. Listen to me.
these two cards right here, they will save your life.
all Jews, regardless of sex and age, with some exceptions are to be deported to work camps in the East by 4 p. m.
today, we expect you to provide a contingent of 6000 people.
this will be the minimum daily quota.
the children in orphanages... - Regardless of sex and age.
perhaps... - Regardless of sex and age.
lieutenant, I am Adam Czerniakow.
chairman of the Jewish Council. I've been given assurances at the highest level, concerning the treatment of children.
I fully expect those assurances to be honored.
kindly sign this proclamation.
I will not.
Mr. Czerniakow...
...if the deportation is impeded in any way by you or your people...
...the consequences will be dire.
this is an assault on our existence as a people!
what do we do in this horror? Do we sit and wait...
...for the next slap in the face from the enemy?
or do we hide within ourselves so the blows don't hurt us so much?
or do we look to God and pray for the Messiah to come?
Messiah, are you coming? I don't think he is. So what do we do?
we use our hands and arms our lives, our deaths, and we fight back, we resist.
if you can't fight, run or hide. But you must resist.
you must. - Rachel! Mama!
mama, show them the permits!
show them! - I did but they didn't care!
I want to go with you!
I want to go with you!
those willing to resist must work together.
we must share arms, information and... What?
we must leave for Warsaw. - What is it?
we must leave. Now.
they've asked me to kill children with my own hands.
this I cannot do.
...Czerniakow.
don't forget your diaries. There'll be time to record your thoughts.
you said we had 15 minutes!
and we will take our 15 minutes!
and when we get to the camp we will all get to see the most beautiful pine trees and birch trees.
and if there are beautiful trees, what else will we see?
birds! - Birds. Yes. That's right.
and what else? - Rabbits?
rabbits, yes. Very good.
And? - Squirrels.
squirrels. Very good, Leon.
many, many squirrels.
don't forget the flag.
there'll be many adventures here One, two, three
don't let them know you're afraid. Don't let them know.
children are marching down the road One, two, three
do your Bund friends have contacts with rail workers?
Yes.
can you make it out again? - I can try.
go, Z ygmunt, follow the trains. Tell us definitively where they are going.
above the road the sun is shining Smiling at the children
forward, forward There'll be many adventures here
I'm separated from my wife and children.
can I find them so we can board together?
on the train. - No, sir, please.
take these. They are worth a lot. Give me a minute! I beg you!
on the train!
on the train!
Dr. Korczak. Why are you here? You are exempt from this order.
what about the children? - The children must board.
then I will do as well.
you mustn't do this. I won't allow you on the train.
then kill me here and now in front of the children.
let me stay with you! Don't let me go with my parents!
I'll be safe with you! Don't let them take me away!
don't let them take me away!
what is it? Where are we going?
Marek said they want workers, but they're not taking cripples.
it's your only chance.
quickly now! Before the guard returns!
it's your only chance.
but I am a dancer.
clara, hold your breath.
Gina was taken to the camps.
Z ygmunt is back from Treblinka.
...It's Mordechai. Can you tell us what you saw?
collect yourself...
...and tell us.
children, women...
...By the thousands...
...gassed to death in showers.
they can hide everything...
...but not the stench of the dead.
this is the map of a camp of death.
this is the map of Treblinka.
and the people pleading for their lives with this scum!
this scum! I want their blood on my hands.
we know that Adam Czerniakow has committed suicide.
we now know that 300, 000 Warsaw Jews...
...have been sent to Treblinka, a death camp, or simply murdered.
for now, deportations have ceased.
when they resume, we will no longer submit.
we're going to respond with armed resistance!
we must use this time to root out traitors...
...acquire weapons, prepare our plan...
...and to let all who remain in the Ghetto know...
...that we can and will fight our enemy now!
with all Jewish groups finally under one banner, with one purpose!
perhaps we can save some lives or remove a few Germans.
but this much I promise you. We will live with honor!
and we will die with honor.
jewish honor.
I am ashamed of what I have been party to.
I am a lawyer by training.
I just wanted to save my family, to survive, like everyone else.
now I am ashamed to wear my uniform.
you should be ashamed. And stop crying like a child.
I don't trust him.
send him on a mission. - I don't trust him!
we'll see which side he's on.
Zachariah will observe. If he fails, we'll execute him...
...like the others who have been cruel to their own people.
if not, keep him in uniform. A policeman working for us is useful.
we want you to go to the Aryan side to smuggle weapons.
are you willing to do that? - Yes.
good. - She has no family anymore.
this is a map of Treblinka.
get it to one of our couriers. It must get to England.
do you see your name?
you are to hide this map inside your shoe.
I say we go out in broad daylight and shoot as many as we can.
forget dying in a blaze of glory! Why give them the satisfaction?
we should wait so we can acquire more weapons and train.
no, we have to escape to the woods create a larger organization and fight from outside the Ghetto.
we'll never make it! We'll be informed on and slaughtered!
let's take them hostage and make them listen to German folk music until they lose their minds.
this is serious! - Every day of peace is another day to prepare for an organized attack.
we need to send messages to the Jewish police and council...
...to our own people and to the Nazis.
we need to do it now. We can't wait. They have to know we mean business.
even if it means using up... - All the weapons?
then we pray.
for what?
for Tosia to get the map out.
and for she and Arie to smuggle more weapons back in.
go in the shack.
come on, go in the shack.
place of work? - The Schmidt foundry.
location? - Chmielna 2.
give me your coat and dress.
now the rest.
want these too?
shoes.
I said shoes.
do you want me to use this?
another one.
another one!
a Jew has escaped. We must capture him! Quickly.
get dressed and get out of here.
quickly.
where are you going? - To work. I just passed my inspection.
Hey, Jew, what are you selling today?
it's Kazik.
I couldn't get close to the gate. It wasn't safe. I followed your wagon.
come, walk.
blackmailers up ahead. We need to laugh.
laugh? - Yes.
jews look down. Jews look sad. Jews avert their eyes.
blackmailers can smell fear. So can you laugh?
try again.
no. If you do it, you do it big. Like this.
I said sleep, not sheep. Sleep!
not bad.
keep practicing.
so he was good.
I want to arrange a meeting with your boss, Szerynski.
you can accomplish this?
Yes.
good.
I'm sorry. It's been in my shoe for a couple days.
gives it character.
do you realize this map of Treblinka will travel by special courier all the way to Prime Minister Churchill?
with the other documents, it should persuade the Allies...
...to get us weapons to bomb the German trains...
...and hopefully even the death camps.
do you understand now?
Yes.
come on. Z ygmunt, let's go!
captain, I have a message from the Jewish Fighting Organization.
for traitorous activities and collaboration...
...you have been tried and condemned to death. Goodbye.
goodbye?
Papa!
is it too heavy? - No, I can carry it.
but what if it gets dropped?
you wouldn't want to drop dynamite. - I know, but what if something falls?
you wouldn't want that.
what if it gets bumped? - Bumped could be okay.
good work.
good job, Calel.
Calel, welcome.
welcome to the family. - Now the Germans will come to us.
Hey, lady, wait! Hold on.
remember: One round, one German. No wasted rounds.
okay, front row kneels.
all right. Steady.
Viatia. - You're with friends here.
steady and fire! Good. And steady...
mordechai, Tosia has brought us gifts.
perfect timing. When can we expect more?
Arie said momentarily. He'll smuggle them personally.
good.
steady...
...and fire!
Devorah, I said aim.
it's very important to aim. Almost as important as firing itself.
Marek, look what Tosia has brought us.
good rule of thumb: Never pat the bomb-maker on the back while he's working.
what's this?
dynamite. Excellent.
I also need potassium chlorate.
I also need bottles. Can you get those? - I'll try.
I also need new lungs.
he worked in the hospital lab. - This is more fun.
anything else, Mr. Engineer? - More. Just more of everything.
more.
you're under arrest!
put down your bombs and return to the Umschlagplatz!
heil Shitler!
heil Hitler!
intelligence estimates there are only 40, 000 left, Reichsfuhrer Himmler.
I'm disappointed, Colonel von Sammern. There are so many.
they sabotaged our factories, attacked our soldiers.
there. Look. You see? And another.
we have an understanding? - Absolutely.
so that would bring us here, right?
who's that girl with the pistol? - Devorah Baron.
she's with Marek and Gutman at the brushmakers.
such a coincidence.
I was thinking I should be stationed at the brushmakers.
don't you agree, boss?
it's a blockade. We are surrounded.
Mordechai! It's a blockade. We are surrounded.
all right. Let's go!
guns up here, ammo up here!
you know what to do! We've been waiting for this!
get the guns out! - Don't forget your ammo!
clara, let's go! Come on!
out! Out!
get in line!
get in line, I said!
up here! There are Jews inside!
they're inside. - Here!
look out! Move!
look out!

Picasso discovered his talent for painting...
when he was nine. Oh. Thanks.
Oh! Tiger Woods swung his first club...
well before his second birthday.
me? I was eight when I discovered my purpose in life.
I was at the St. Thomas Church next to the Wyatt Regency in Weekend, New Jersey.
it was my cousin Lisa's wedding.
here, Dad. Let me.
it was our first big family event since Mom died...
and Dad was not in great shape.
daddy, can you take me to the girls' room? I have to go pee.
uh, come on, Tess. Let's go.

Oh, Janey, I'm sorry. It's okay. We have cable.

the heck am I gonna do?
thank you so much, sweetie. You saved the day.
Janey, get my train.
and that was the moment. That's when I fell in love with weddings.
I knew that I had helped someone on the most important day of their life.
and I couldn't wait for my own special day.
Oh, Jane, that's stunning. It really is. It's the perfect dress.
Oh, my God. You look so beautiful.
Really? You really think so?
it's amazing, like it was made for you.
it's for you. It's the bride. Oh, great.
thank you. Hi, Suzanne.
Jane, is it ready? Yeah. They just finished hemming it.
it fits? I know. Thank God we're the same size.
are you coming now? I'm gonna have it over to you in just a minute.
don't worry about anything. This is your day. Thanks, Jane.
come on. Get that out of here.
there you are! You look great.
Thanks! Okay. Let's go. Come on.
Oh. Here.
what's this? I brought you a shawl, Visine, Tylenol...
a pair of my earrings. Ooh.
about your hair.
what? The bitch said, "Up." It's up.
okay. I'll fix it inside.
what's all this stuff?
let's just hurry.
aren't the dresses great? The best thing about them is...
you can shorten them and wear them again. Definitely. So true.
give me a smile.
okay. Excuse me. On the right.
we are gathered here today to celebrate the union...

No! Okay, then.
okay. Which one do you want? The brunet or the blond?
I kinda want the blond. I'm not gonna lie.
Casey, can't you keep it in your pants for one wedding?
are you kidding? The only reason to wear this monstrous dress...
is so some drunken groomsman can rip it to shreds with his teeth.
what time is it now? Well, I'm just gonna be about two more hours, so
I'll call you back.
#Lovely is the feeling now #
Hey! Wrong shoes! Wait a minute. Wrong shoes.

Jane, I'm so hungry. Did you eat anything?
Oh, yeah. It looks gorgeous. I haven't eaten anything.

I'll tell ya. Whoa. Fall right off.
did you meet my grandma?
Yeah. She was great. I really enjoyed her.
I think she's having fun. Oh, yeah. Lots.
#Don't stop till you get enough #
#Keep on with the force #
#Don't stop till you get enough # #Keep on, baby #
#Don't stop till you get enough ##
Jane, what is that thing on your forehead?
I'd like to take a moment to give a special thank you to a girl...
who's really gone above and beyond.
the girl who not only hosted my shower and helped me design the invitation
she went with me to the caterer, the florist, the wedding cake bakery
and to eight bridal stores...
where she helped me cling to my selfesteem.
as I tried on dress after dress.
so thanks, Jane!
Thanks, Jane.
okay! Everybody ready?
is she all right?
is she all right?
whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy. Just take it easy.
you don't wanna move around too much. Okay. This is a serious injury.
I need you to give me some ice. You, give me a bottle of 100proof liquor...
and something she can bite on stat!
all right. She's fine, folks.
just a little bump on the head. Carry on.
you a doctor?
no, but Tweedledee and "Tweedledrunk" were bugging me, so Okay. Do you know your name? Jane.
Jane. I'm Kevin.
hmm. Thank you for helping me.
sure. Got it? Uh huh.
okay. You're good? I'm fine.
all right.
whoa, whoa. Okay. Why don't we get you a cab?
all right. Nice and easy. Let's walk.
# That I'm irresponsibly mad #
#For you ##
I loved your thong, by the way.
you buzzed past me earlier. I saw you changing gowns.
you were in two weddings in one night, weren't you?
that's a little upsetting, don't you think? They're both good friends...
and their weddings happened to be on the same night, so what was I supposed to do?
Oh, no. That's not the upsetting part. How do you stand it?
I mean, isn't one wedding bad enough? I love weddings. I always have.
Really? Yeah.
which part, the forced merriment, horrible music or bad food?
actually, it's meeting upbeat people like yourself.
love is patient. Love is kind. Love means slowly losing your mind.
what is it you do again? I'm a writer.
right.
this is my building. I got it.
no. I got it. Sure?
Yeah.
all right, sweetie. A hundred and forty. You know what you did.
Hey! What's No. He's gonna be right back. Hold on.
don't you think it's a whole lot of ritual for something that.
let's face it It's got about a 5050 shot of making it out of the gate.
how very refreshing. A man who doesn't believe in marriage.
I'm just trying to point out the hypocrisy of the spectacle.
that's so noble of you. Do you also go around...
telling small children that Santa Claus doesn't exist?
cause someone needs to blow that shit wide open.
so you admit that believing in marriage is kind of like believing in Santa Claus.
no. I...
I don't know why I'm arguing this with a perfect stranger.
but, yes, marriage, like everything good and important, isn't easy.
cynicism, on the other hand, always is.
it was very interesting meeting you. Bye.
Yeah.
you gonna be in more weddings next weekend?
I have to go. How many have you been in, by the way?
just, like, ballpark. Good night.
Hey, you know what? Could you...Yeah?
forget it. Yup.
okay.
death. Destruction. Wedding vows. Yea.
come to mama.
Oh.
jeter hit a walk off in the ninth. Did you see it?
uh, no. I work Saturday nights, remember?
here. From the happy couple. Oh, that's right.
you were eating coconut cake and doing the Electric Slide.
so how'd it go? Oh, let's see.
the bride wore a gown that sparkled like the groom's eyes...
as he saw her approaching through a shower of rose petals.
and you're not getting laid?
commitments is the gold standard of wedding announcements.
every girl on the planet rips open that page, first thing Sunday.
brides kill to get in there.
do you have any idea what you can be doin'?
you mean to women who are about to get married? Yeah.
they won't call you. They won't bother you.
they will pretend they never even met you. You can't beat that.
well, it's not gonna matter much longer anyway.
you're looking at my ticket out of the taffeta ghetto.
keep on dreaming.
uh, go away. Yes. Okay.
what? I wasn't gonna come to work in my bridesmaid dress.
today walk of shame outfit. Elegant.
what happened to you the other night?
you were barely there, and then you disappeared.
you meet someone? Come on. No.
Oh. Ridiculous question.
good morning, Gina.
you haven't seen my Filofax anywhere, have you? No.
no. Okay. I'll go look for it.
did you get those catalog pages in for George? No.
okay. No worries. I'll get them from production.
Attagirl. Show her who's boss.
I'm not her boss. You're the boss's assistant.
same diff. What's the good of your job if you can't abuse the power?
Casey, go to Accounting. Now you're bossy.
where the hell did I put that thing?
that is a great idea for the front page of the section.
Oh, come on, Doyle. How many times have I heard this from you?
I'm telling you, Maureen. It's a great idea.
Really?
as great as your last great idea, an expose on price fixing at wedding bakeries?
Yes! Yes! They're ripping people off. Flour costs pennies per ounce.
that's an 8000/0 markup. It's outrageous.
Yes, it is. Also, no one cares.
what about the piece I wanted to do on the exploitation of workers in lace factories?
that is a killer piece. Oh, right.
that's what people really wanna read about in the Style section.
Kevin, this section practically pays for the entire paper.
our advertisers want fun, upbeat, colorful human interest stories...
opposite their products.
so that's what we're about now? Making money?
get out. All right. Listen. That was not right.
I get it. But this one is. Look, this woman...
has been in seven weddings，So?
this year. She was in two on Saturday alone.
but it won't just be about her.
it'll be an incisive look at how the wedding industry has transformed something...
that should be an important rite of passage into nothing more than a corporate revenue stream.
in a fun, upbeat, you know, cheerful way.
look, Maureen, I am dying back there in Commitments.
if I have to write another sentence about baby's breath,
I'm gonna shoot myself.
this is a real story. This is what I wanna do.
I need you covering weddings. That's what you're good at.
and that's what I need you to do.
if you don't start giving me feature stories, I'm gonna have to quit.
one chance. If I don't like it, you go back to Commitments for the rest of your life...
with a big smile on that ridiculously handsome face of yours.
deal.
you think he'll like these? Yes, I do.
I think those photos for the fall catalog will cause George to take you into his office...
and make sweet love to you for hours and hours.
tell me that crazy crush is the reason you work as hard as you do, 'cause it's upsetting.
just like my job. Okay?
no. You just think that one day...
george is gonna wake up and realize that he is madly in love with you...
and he's gonna make some spectacular gesture of love
flowers for Jane Nichols.
Yeah. That's me. Thank you.
that's great. I spent two days in bed with a guy, and you get flowers.
nice. There's no note.
Oh, Jane. You don't seriously think they're from your dream guy, do you?
Gina, can you take these to my desk for me?
sure. No problem. Thank you.
would you please stop saying that? Nobody knows.
everybody knows, Jane, except George.
it's true.
Gatsby! Hi, buddy. Hi!
Whoa! Come on, Gatsby. No slobbering on the ladies.
Hi.
how was it? It was phenomenal. Up and back...
in 10 hours our best time yet.
isn't that, like, the eighth time you climbed Mount Whitney?
how do you remember that stuff, Jane? I don't know.
so we just got these in. What do you think?
I think they're too corporate.
that's what I was thinking. They don't have enough of a feel of being
outdoors. Right. I mean, there's no adventure.
there's no danger. Plus, everyone looks way too put together.
Yeah. Like models. Got it. I will talk to Marketing.
see? That's why I keep you around, Jane.
I mean, who else could finish my sentences?
your design meeting is at 11: 00.
and the 92nd Street Y called to confirm that you'll be attending their benefit.
you wanna go? Do I have to make a speech?
just a few words about ecologically responsible business practices.
something light and fun. You in?
Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Put it on the calendar...
but I'm probably gonna need to dig up a date for that, huh?
Yeah. Probably. At least that's the one thing in my life...
you don't have to take care of for me, right? Yeah.
Oh, my... God!
leave me alone. Jane!
yeah? Did you put that breakfast burrito on my desk?
I just thought you might be hungry.
that's why I love ya.
I love you too.
Oh! Yeah.
Yeah. You're right. I needed that.
okay, everybody.
I hope to see you all at my engagement party tonight.
and, Jane, thanks again for arranging everything.
no problem.
do you wanna come over to my place before the party?
some of the guys from Shipping are coming...
and they're bringing tequila and bubble wrap.
fun!
I can't. I gotta pick up Tess from the airport.
God! Wouldn't it be great if there was a service that you could hire to do that?
like yellow cars or shiny black sedans.
I want to pick her up. She's my baby sister.
Plus, she needs my help, so See ya. Wouldn't wanna be ya.
Hi!
Yea!
Hey! When did you start traveling so lightly?
Oh.
I always meet the nicest people on planes.
hmm. Come on. Parked in P9.
Rudolfo said he wanted to come back to New York with me, of course...
but I told him that I needed space, you know?
Spazio, Rudolfo! Spazio.
Oh! This is so tiny and cute. I love it.
Ah. Feels so good to be home.
six months away feels like forever.
mom was my age, you know?
almost to the day. Yeah.
it was the perfect wedding
the Boathouse, the big band, ceremony at sunset.
except that dress.
I mean, the synthetic lace and the inverted box pleats.
I think it was perfect.
well, they really did love each other.
what are these? Wedding announcements?
I'm No. They're just I was...
excuse me. I was going to recycle them.
well, excuse me. Into what? Wallpaper?
it's just this one guy.
Malcolm Doyle I only keep his. He writes the best ones.
I just I love the stories The crazy proposals...
the engagements.
Yeah. Never mind. It's not really your thing. So, um, how long you stayin'?
um, a week or two 'cause the fall fashion shows are done, so I don't have much work.
speaking of work. I am meeting up with some people from the office tonight for a party.
you wanna come?
actually, I'm having drinks with some friends from Milan.
all right. So, let me get this straight.
you would rather go have drinks with Italian models...
than come to my awesome work party?
weird, huh? Yeah.
but I'll try to make it. Well, thanks.
grey Goose is in the freezer. Red Bull's on top of the 'fridge.
in the cupboard there are Strawberry Pop Tarts. Jinx!
I said it first. I beat you.
St. Marks and A. You got it.
Hi, Gina. Hey, George.
great party. Thanks for comin'.
you got them champagne glasses and a bottle of Cristal.
all right. Any way she's gonna believe that it actually came from me?
maybe. I wrapped it like a car ran over it.
nice. Nice touch.
Ah, look. I'm gonna go to the bar, get a couple of drinks.
you guys need anything. A little liquid courage?
maybe some hair of the dog for you?
I'm good. Thanks.
he asks if you want a drink, you smile and you say, "Vodka soda."
if you already have a drink, you down it. Then there's some flirting, some interoffice sex...
an accidental pregnancy, a shotgun wedding and a life of bliss.
how many times do we have to go over this?
I don't want him to think I'm irresponsible.
Yeah. That's what guys want, responsible. Mmm!
you're wrong. George appreciates me for the way I am.
what good is it being appreciated if no one is naked?
Hey, Jane. Look. By the way...
did you get that thing I left on your desk this morning?
on my desk? Yeah. Was that okay?
okay? It was great. Okay. Good. Good.
cause, you know, we haven't really had that kind of relationship before...
so I just wanted to make sure you were okay with it.
George! All right. Excuse me.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He gave me flowers. He gave me flowers.
okay. Stop it. This is real life. This is not a fantasy.
you have to go over there and tell him how you feel.
okay. It's now or never, so so now.
now, now. Go. Now! Yeah.
Jane. Sorry.
George, this is my sister, Tess.
Tess, this is my George No! I didn't mean it like that.
Jane is my assistant. Kind of like my right hand.
lucky her.
Yeah.
it's kind of like whatever I need, she takes care of.
as if I don't take enough advantage of her already...
I even dropped my dry cleaning slip off on her desk today.
your dry cleaning slip.
it was an emergency, so Of course.
good fluffandfold is no joking matter.
Yeah. Especially when you're down to your last pair of socks.
right.
you wanna get a drink? Mm hmm.
came to have a drink with my sister.
Janey?
Hi. How are you?
were the flowers too much?
they're from you. Uh huh.
you sent them. The angry marriagehater.
Oh, that's such...a good news.
good news. Hey, Kev, can you hold this for one sec?
uh, sure. Thanks.
Motherf
Why? Why?
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
Congratulations.
fifty. Wow. That's...
I'm sorry. You were saying.
uh, I just asked if you'd got my flowers.
Oh, and I have something for you.
I wanted to give you Here you are. Oh, my God. Thank God.
Yeah. You left it in the cab.
it was either the engagement party tonight...
or Thursday's bikini wax, so I thought that You read it? Yeah. Well, no. I tried to read it.
it was very hard. All your little notes in the little cramped handwriting.
it's very unabomber. You know, they do have these Space Age computer date books now...
that take care of everything for you. Oh, yes.
I don't need to be taken care of. Thank you.
uh, have a drink with me.
yeah? Uh, you know
thank you for bringing back my Filofax. That was very nice.
it's a drink. It's not a week in Oahu. Come on. It'll take the edge off.
come on. Just one drink.
I'm sorry. I'm really not gonna be very much...
fun tonight.
got it. Totally got it. So maybe I'll bump into you on Thursday.
maybe not. I'll see you around.
who was that? And where can I get one?
is he coming back?
that's freakin' insane. I could never do that.
no, no. You didn't eat it?
Oh, my God. I didn't even see it. I promise.
it's late. You must be exhausted. Let's You wanna
let's go dancing. What? No. I don't George, you don't wanna...
Yeah. No. I'll go. Okay.
Yeah, but I gotta warn you. I'm a terrible dancer. Come on.
no. It's true. In fact, on several occasions, they've had to call the paramedics.
you wanna come too, Jane? Um
no, no. You guys go.
have a good time. Okay. Let's go.
go to sleep, Jane.
go to sleep. 3: 00 a. m?
# Well, sometimes I go out by myself #
#And I look across the water #
#And I think of all the things what you're doin'#
#And in my head I paint a picture #
# 'Cause since I come home #
# Well, my body's been a mess #
#And I miss your tender hair #
#And the way you like to dress #
#Oh, won't you come on over #
#Stop making a fool out of me #
# Why don't you come on over, Valerie ##
Oh, hi, Tess. How was your date? Nice? What?
you talked about me the whole time?
don't feel bad. I'm a really important part of his life.
we spend every hour, every day together.
Hey! Still up? Hi.
Yeah, just doin' a little bit of cleaning. Harnessing my chi.
Janey, I had...
the best night ever.
Oh, that's right! I totally forgot you went out.
Ow! Is that weird for you?
what? Weird? Why would it be weird? He's my boss. I don't care. Whatever.
okay. Great. 'Cause we're having lunch tomorrow.
that's so great!
Yeah. I think so too. Except not quite at that decibel.
so tell me about George.
Oh. Well.
uh, he, uh
well, he dropped out of college...
and then climbed every major peak in the world.
and then he started Urban Everest from his apartment...
and turned it into one of the most ecofriendly philanthropic businesses in the world all before he was 30.
Wow. Yeah.
and that's just his resume.
he is an unbelievable boss. Everybody loves him. Everybody.
and he loves his dog, Gatsby, more than anyone.
he doesn't eat red meat, which is kinda cool.
and he would rather spend all his time outside than anywhere else.
my God. He sounds amazing.
Yeah, but he has flaws. He does.
he is flawed.
what do you mean? Well, he hates cashews...
which is weird.
and sometimes he doesn't wear socks with sneakers.
I just think that's gross.
Jane, those aren't exactly dealbreakers.
deal. What deal?
I mean, nothing happened between the two of you tonight, did it?
did it? Well.
Oh. I got ya. Nice.
Mmm. Fun.
sounds fun.
dad? Oh, hey, sweetie.
how are you? Oh, you didn't have to
Tessie! Oh! Oh!
Hi. Look at you.
Oh, Dad. This place looks exactly the same.
now that's not fair.
I got a brand new awning. I just stripped and revarnished all the woodwork. Look.
new cash register. Digital. Oh.
wow, Dad. I'm sorry. I don't know how I missed all these...
remarkable improvements.
give me that. Let's go upstairs.
there we go.
dad, aren't we a little old for these?
no. Good, 'cause I love 'em!
so, Tess, how long you here for?
one to two weeks, right? That's what you said.
um, actually, it just depends on how a few things pan out.
what things?
What，what，what few things? What's Hello? Hi! Let me guess.
some new guy is chasing after her?
I wouldn't call it "chasing."
Oh, George. I would love to...Jane?
what? You okay?
Yeah! Oh, yeah. Great. Fine. Everything's fine.
of course.
I gotta stop.
she's gonna call me. I guarantee it.
I got a way of making the ladies reach out to me.
Oh, yeah. How?
Oh, God.
Whoo! Ah. Hello.
you ripped a week out of my planner. Are you insane?
it's a little experiment. See how you do without every second of your life mapped out.
by the way, your life is insane.
what do you do besides work and help people get married?
you know what? I don't see how that's any of your business.
how do you afford these weddings?
I mean, the dresses, the airfares, the wine of the month clubs?
Hey, people love that gift. And I'm a frequent member.
so sometimes they throw in a free gewurztraminer.
Wow. That is terribly sad. I'm sorry about that.
Ah. Well, look. I wanna make it up to you.
okay? How about a new date book or maybe just a date?
uh, yeah. Sure. Let me just pencil you in.
except, hey! You already did.
every Saturday for the rest of the year.
you know what? Can you please, please find someone else to be creepy with?
Nope. Tell you what. Anytime you wanna hang out with somebody...
who doesn't need you to take them to a fitting or a cake tasting...
or a coed monitor and burrito rehearsal dinner, just give me a call.
Yeah. Okay.
Oh, God.
Hey! Hey!
are we getting too old for hugs? No.
thank you.
there he is.
Pedro. How's it goin'? Hey, what's up?
so Pedro is my...uh I'm his little brother.
from the Big Brother Program at the Y.
Oh. Pedro, Tess happens to be Jane's sister.
Oh. Hola, Pedro.
Yeah. Um, look, Jane, Tess and I...
are gonna take Pedro to his baseball game if you wanna join us.
I can't. I've got so much work to do. I should stay here.
are you kidding me, Jane? Look, your boss is a jerk anyhow.
let's go. I don't wanna have to fire you. Okay.
all right? All right. Let's go.
Hey. How you doin'? All right.
let me get three Diet Pepsis, three fries and Chili dog. You want a chili dog? Uh, no.
not unless it's a tofu dog with meatless chili.
I'm sorry. What?
you're a vegetarian? Uh huh. It's recent.
Oh, is it? You know, 'cause I'm a vegetarian too.
I used to be a vegan, but it was too much of a hassle.
Oh, God. I know. I mean, even being a vegetarian is a challenge.
I mean, every time I go hiking, I have to bring my homemade to furky jerky.
you go hiking? I mean, no offense...
but you hardly seem like the kind of girl that hits the trails
especially in those shoes.
the best "to furky" is made by publicists in kitten heels.
I can see how you would think that, but I actually love...
all that outdoorsy type of stuff.
you know, hiking and biking and climbing up things.
but, to tell you the truth,
I haven't been hiking since，well, since my dog died.
see Jane and I had this dog growing up, Tory.
I just I loved him.
he would just go on nature hikes and climbing adventures.
not a day goes by that I don't think about that bag of fleas.
good ol' Tory.
Jane, how come you never mentioned Tory?
I don't know.
I must have repressed the memory of "Toby."
Yeah. His name was "Toby,"
but I called him "Tory" because I had a lisp.
a lisp that turned your "B's" to "R's"?
you know what? When I was a kid, I had a stutter.
no way!
we have more things in common than I thought. Yeah, me too.
I'm gonna go out and shag some flies with Pedro.
Ooh! I'm jealous. It sounds fun.
what are "shagging flies"? What are you doing?
what? You hate dogs and tofu and being outside.
no. I like yachts. I like flowers. I like, you know, tanning.
I mean, it's not exactly the same
and you hated Toby.
you hated him. The only animals you ever cared about are dead ones with sleeves.
you're just saying all this stuff because George is so... attractive.
or some people think he is. I did not hate that dog.
I just hated it when he slobbered on me.
and I could like soy milk and hiking if I tried it. Maybe.
Hey, Tess. What do you say you come out here. Let's see that arm.
Ooh. Fun. Are we gonna shag now?
ever done this before? No. I don't know how to do this.
here you go. Okay. Like that?
put this arm down there. All right? Hold that elbow up.
okay. All right. Hold it there.
Hi.
thank you. Thank you.

which one sucks less? This one.
good. Maybe, uh, would you mind again? Nope.
thank you. I do it for my dad all the time.
you okay? You seem a little bit nervous.
Yeah. No. I'm cool.
how's it look? Great.
here you go. Mm hmm. Thank you.
Oh, hey. Guys, guys! Hold it. She's not the one. She's not the one.
Hey. Jane.
I'm so sorry. I should've called, but you forgot your wallet.
Oh. Well, thanks.
sorry I'm late.
Hey, guys. Now, now.
Jane, what's going on?
come here, boy.
golly. Here you go.
Oh! Hey, Tess.
sorry. Um
will you do me a favor? Sit down a second.
okay.
so, Tess. My parents met playing hopscotch when they were, like, eight years old...
and they were married for 42 years.
and I've been waiting my whole life to feel the way my dad felt about my mom.
and maybe I've been too busy trying to make something of myself...
but, I think I... Oh!
missed some of those moments.
but, Tess, the second that I saw you... Okay.
I knew that we could be great together.
so, um
Tess, will you marry me?
Yes, of course I will.
George.
so, wait. Does this mean that you're moving back here?
Yup.
whoa. Well, I...I don't know what to say.
you give Jane a job...
then you get Tessie to move back home.
George, you're my hero. I mean it.
Oh, thank you. You have a couple of pretty great girls here.
wait. Just a second. I wanna get somethin'. Don't go anywhere.
who isn't?
I'm so excited that we did this today.
he's so happy. Tess.
daddy!
your mother would've wanted you to have it. Daddy, thank you!
okay.
thank you. Okay.
Jane, you don't mind, right? No. No.
you can have it after me.
no. That's good. It's right. Mom would've wanted that.
Yeah. Mom would've wanted that. That's my Jane.
okay. Yeah. That's right.
it was my mother's.
isn't that amazing? That's beautiful.
dad, I don't even know what to say.
uh, so I'm just trying to figure out why you decided to meet with me.
you've been ducking me and then, all of a sudden...
my little sister's getting married.
Ah, before you. That's not what I'm upset about.
then what are you upset about?
you don't know Tess. She's gonna want me to do everything.
I'm not gonna just be her maid of honor.
I'm gonna be taking care of everything.
so why don't you just say, "No"? What?
say, "No."
you have said, "No," to people before? Yes. Of course.
many, many times. In this situation, never. Not once.
Ah, but you want to say, "No."
but I can't. It's my sister.
but you can say, "No." Because it's your sister
all right. You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna practice.
all right? We're gonna practice saying, "No." You think I'm kidding?
turn around. We're gonna play this game. Come on. Humor me.
all right. Jane, give me 50 bucks.
No! Jane, it's 50 bucks. I'll pay you back.
no.
Jane, I need you...
to give me 50 bucks.
no?
eh, not bad.
can I have your drink? Sure.
No!
Oh, no. You were doing so well.
that's terrible. Mm hmm.
so you went by the flower shop and ordered the favors? Yup.
what about the invitation mockups?
done. This is so much fun!
did I tell you I asked Julie to be one of the bridesmaids?
who? Cousin Julie. Second cousin twice removed.
what about Mimi? Cousin Mimi? Oh, no way.
she's so pregnant. It'll just throw off the aesthetics.
I'm sorry. I know you don't love Julie.
what's not to love about a woman who asked me if I chaired...
the Itty Bitty Titty Committee all through my teen years?
just don't listen to her. Your boobs came in eventually. They just missed high school.
as for the third bridesmaid, I want you to ask your friend...
that really rude one. Casey?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. My Casey?
she's really pretty. She can pull off the strapless.
I don't have that many girlfriends. For some reason, girls just don't like me.
I don't know why.
okay. Fine. I know why. Will you just ask her?
sure. Of course.
so I was also thinking we could do a slide show for the rehearsal dinner.
you know, put pictures of George and I together and say funny things.
okay. Oh, and guess what.
that writer you obsess about...
he wants to do a whole Commitments column on us in the Journal.
he called me. Can you believe it?
at this point, I absolutely can.
listen, um, I've been thinking a lot about what you said, and I think you're right.
I think it would be so special if I did a wedding just like Mom and Dad's.
just like? You know, especially since I'm wearing Mom's dress.
so, tada!
the Boathouse? Uh huh.
at first, when I called, they said they had no availability for 18 months.
but then the ninth time I called, they said they had a cancellation.
apparently the bride slept with the groom's father and brother...
and sister and all these people.
so, obviously, it got canceled and they were all devastated.
but which means...
we're getting married in three weeks.
three weeks?
uh huh. Oh, Jane. I know you can pull it together quickly.
and I didn't wanna wait that long anyway, so
uh, you could be a little excited for me.
no, I am. It's just
it's just that you wanted to get married at The Boathouse in Mom's dress too.
I know.
no, I just I didn't know that that's what you wanted...
but if it is, then I just want you to be happy.
you know that. Great!
okay. Now can we talk about more important stuff?
come on. I really don't like the linens, and I think we need to rent new ones...
because they do not go with the color scheme that I picked out.
that selfish whore.
Namaste. Namaste.
I can't believe it. I cannot believe it.
there is no man that won't fall for her. Even a dogooder like George.
men just become hypnotized by her voodoo and they lose their minds.
you can't plan your sister's wedding to the man you love.
it's sick.
to be fair, she didn't know how I felt about him.
and nor should she...He's my boss.
I'm just gonna have to get over it. I don't really have a choice.
and neither do you.
she wants you to be a bridesmaid.
you are shitting me.
Hello? Please.
no. No, I won't do it, on principle.
I say, "No," on principle. No. You can count me out.
please don't leave me alone in this.
please, please, please. Fine. Fine.
because it's you. But if she crosses me, I'm gonna kick her ass.
and then I will kick your ass. Then I'm gonna have a couple drinks.
there's no sign that says, "No talking."
three weeks? It cannot be done.
it is not enough time for one of my creations! Okay, um...
Antoine, remember when I brought you the Schecters...
and they commissioned that sixtiered, heartshaped masterpiece?
then, of course, the tower of edible gifts...
for the SchifmanGuardino outdoor fiesta.
you can do anything, and we both know it.
you're gonna do the cake, and you're gonna do it in three weeks...
and I would like a discount, please. Three weeks?
it pleases me. Delightful.
we have a cake.
what are you doing here?
Hi. I'm Malcolm Doyle.
what? Oh, yes. I didn't wanna believe it till you were here.
um, this is my fiance, George. Hi. Congratulations to the both of you.
thank you.
Oh. Babe, I gotta take this. All right?
okay. If there's a cake emergency...
I'm right over here.
Oh, and this is Jane, my sister.
she's obsessed with your stories.
she keeps them, but pretends she doesn't, but she does. Okay.
she's your number one fan.
not in a creepy way though.
right. You said your name was "Kevin."
as in "Kevin."
well, I use "Malcolm" for the byline so I don't get stalked by crazy brides.
so how did you meet George? You're an asshole.
Jane. What? I'm sorry. He said his name was "Kevin."
I'm just I'm a little bit confused. Wait.
you guys know each other?
well, we both work the wedding circuit, so...
can you just give us one second? I'm just gonna over for one second...
talk to talk about you.
Antoine.
you lied to me.
no. I told you I was a writer.
I didn't tell you what I wrote.
but But you write the most beautiful things.
do you actually believe in love and marriage and pretend to be a cynic...
or are you a cynic who knows how to spin romantic crap for girls like me?
I didn't follow that at all. But I think the second one, the spinning crap one.
Oh, my God. I feel like I found out my favorite love song was written about a sandwich.
um, can I steal you away to tell you about George and me?
of course. Of course. That's why I'm here.
what? Tess is not here.
I'm here to see you. Why?
come on. I have to talk to all of the friends and family.
it'll take five minutes. Please?
for George and Tess?
well, okay.
thank you.
may I come in? Just ask me what you wanna ask me.
or would you prefer to lie some more? I didn't lie to you.
I don't know why you keep saying that.
I may have left out a couple of things.
can we just get this over with?
the maid of honor is a peculiar young woman.
so tell me how you feel about Tess's whirlwind romance.
I couldn't be happier. She's my kid sister.
I taught her how to tell time, how to ride a bike...
how to steam flounder in the dishwasher.
I mean, I practically raised her Oh, please, don't print that.
that would kill my father.
wait. What are those?
nothing.
are those...No!
are they bridesmaid dresses? This is none of your business.
Oh! Good God.
what? You kept them all? You have a whole closet full. Why?
I have a lot of friends and I like to keep them.
right. Well, that makes complete sense...
because they're beautiful. Some are not that bad.
not that "bad"? I'd like to see one of them that's not that bad.
fine.
um, well.Not that one.
this one...This one is really...
horrible. Right? Was the word you're looking for.
what color is this? Vomit?
no, it's like a It's an "olivey" green. It's very in.
I'm telling you, it looks great on.
uh, no. I'm telling you that this is an instrument of torture...
inflicted on you by a bride who wants you to look ugly.
no. Jenna picked it because it looks good on everybody.
slightly delusional and will believe anything anyone tells her.
that is not true and I'm going to show you you are wrong.
see?
it's not so bad. This sash is really very flat.
okay. You are totally right about the dress. It is not that bad.
but, come on. The color? Please.
well, it's your flash. I think it's blowing it out weird...
and if it were just a normal Okay, it's not very good.
you kind of look like a shiny mermaid.
you should be flattered. She didn't want to stand next to a tall, beautiful woman...
and have you actually looking decent.
it's really not the worst one.
if I had to pick one I got a good one.
this is my favorite. Oh, my God.
what the hell is that? Theme wedding.
what was the theme, "humiliation"? God!
no, people do not have Gone With The Wind weddings.
I have been to three.
let's do it. All right.
y'all say, "Diddlydee." Diddlydee.
Oh!
I feel sick. All right. What else you got? Show me some more.
okay. Okay.
you have to show me Benihana. Give it.
Aha!
very pretty. Do you feel pretty?
adorable.
every bride loves her accessories.
men wore dresses. Women wore suits.
Whoa!
Kevin? Yup.
Oh!
um
what was the theme here?
l. A. Wedding.
# You gotta party If you're feeling hearty #
#She's in love now #
# Would you rather see #
# That you know Yeah #
#Come on #
Twentyseven dresses. You gotta be kidding me.
I don't get it. All right. You...You do the thing, you have the dress.
just throw it out. That's a huge closet.
you live in New York. You cannot be eating up space like that.
strange as it sounds, I've had some really good times in those dresses.
weird as that may be. I don't believe you.
I don't care if somebody wants me to wear a funny dress.
it's their day, not mine.
God bless you.
and if supporting them when they get married means...
snowshoeing to a mountaintop in the Alps or...
helping to caulk a fountain for some swans, then
you actually did that?
Oh, I'm a really, very good caulker.
likes caulk.
all right. But come on. Seriously.
I mean, how much time do you spend doing this for other people?
what about What about you? You don't have any needs?
no, I don't. I'm Jesus.
someday God...knows when...But someday...
it'll be my day.
and then all those people will be there for me. So
that is if I ever
sorry.
you don't get it.
that's fine. Why would you?
Hey. I need your registry list.
I thought you were gonna wait downstairs.
what is that?
george is in Telluride. Who's in here?
no one.
let's talk in the hall. Tess.
Jane
he was looking for a part time job.
he's... cleaning the apartment.
# Oh, boy # Look, don't tell George.
it's Pedro and my little secret, okay?
#I don't really know what I'm doing #
Kevin!
that bridesmaid story what do you have so far?
uh, it's a little rough. I'm still working on it.
I want to see it. I'm not even Right now. Email it. It's not I'm not finished with it. It's not done.
can you go away, please? I did not invite you.
well, luckily Tess did.
when I cover a wedding, I gotta see every aspect.
you know, your sister wants so many presents from so many stores...
that she physically cannot register for them all herself.
she's pressed for time. It's a short engagement.
good God. Another one?
to you, it's just another casserole dish.
to Tess, it's the pot she's gonna cook my mother's Christmas roast in.
Oh, Tess cooks?
all right. Well, I'm gonna cook it. But Tess will be there...
with George.
and this isn't just another "vahze."
vase.
this is the "vahze" that Tess will get out...
when George brings home flowers, just because he felt like it.
I see. And this this is the rooster shaped umbrella holder that will hold all of George's umbrellas.
fine. Be a jerk.
all I'm saying is that this isn't just stuff.
these are the things that make up a life together. No.
this is the useless crap that the 70billiondollarayear wedding industry...
has convinced us all that we have to have or we won't be happy.
you know what I think?
I think that all your statistics and theories...
are just a smoke screen.
Oh, really? For what?
your little secret whatever it is.
your parents got divorced.
you haven't found the right girl.
you're afraid you never will. Mm hmm.
and I think you love weddings so much...
because you'd rather focus on other people's Kodak moments than make memories of your own.
you're right. Know why?
because weddings are the perfect place to forget about being single.
I think you want a wedding not a marriage, a wedding.
what is your problem?
did you have your own fancy wedding and your wife left you or something?
bingo.
what?
with my roommate from college, by the way.
so I think you get an extra bingo for that.
Oh, shit. Kevin, I'm
I'm so sorry. It was just It was a guess.
it was a good one.
for someone who has no insight whatsoever into herself...
you nailed me right on the head.
want to find the ugliest stuff in the store and register Tess for it?
let's do it.
Wow.
I told you I was not done with it yet. No, it's good.
I meant, "Wow, it's actually decent."
I have to admit, I was shocked...
but, uh, it's smart and, uh, biting...
and actually entertaining as hell.
well, thank you. You really nailed this girl.
we're running it Sunday, front page of the section.
um, here is where you jump up and down with gratitude.
Oh.No, no, no, no. I just...
I just don't think it's perfect yet. I really want to get this right.
we should just hold it a week.
wait. You've been begging me for months...
and now you want me to hold the story so you can move some commas around?
I don't know. Now that I'm in it, she's more than just this perpetual bridesmaid.
you know, I don't know. There's There's a lot more to her than that.
huh. If I didn't know you any better...
I would say that you'd developed a little crush.
very funny. Look, I know I can make it better.
it's good the way it is. Will you just give me a week? Just a week.
fine. Get out.
Hi. Oh, hey. Thank you for coming on such short notice.
Oh, it's no problem. I'm happy to help.
and I have more experience eating than Tess does, so you're in good hands.
now, we've planned your wedding dinner to your exact specifications.
Jane's phone. Tess?
Hey, it's Kevin. Hey! How is the article coming?
uh, I think it's gonna be a great piece. I think you'll be very happy.
I can't wait. Hey, listen. Any chance you know where Jane is?
Yeah, you know, the thing that I like about Tess is there's no bullshit.
you know, she's not afraid to be herself.
George, about Tess There's something that I want to say.
what?
I'm just so happy for you, that you found what you were looking for.
all right. So what's your favorite part...
of a wedding?
Oh, that's easy.
you know when the music starts and the bride makes her big entrance...
and everybody turns to look at her?
that's when I look at the groom. 'Cause his face says it all.
you know, the pure love there.
that's why I go.
okay. So when you get married and you make your entrance...
I have full permission to look at the groom?
Yes. Please do. Please make sure the poor sucker is still standing there.
are you kidding me? Some guy would be lucky to have you.
and the way that you attacked that tomatillo before Who could resist that?
very sexy.
Doyle?
Hey. Hey.
what are you doing here?
are you guys picking out the wedding meal?
Where's Tess? She's... getting her hair done.
I'm just helping out.
we're heading up to Rhine beck to pick out some linens from an antique store.
Yeah, we really should go, because Tess and I have dinner with my parents.
well, why don't I just go with you? What? No. No. That's okay.
um, I can get you back on time. I got my dad's Volvo, and that thing books.
all right, look. I really don't mind. It's totally fine.
I got a couple more questions to ask you anyway for the article.
which I'd be happy to answer, by phone or email.
if you wouldn't mind, that would be a great help.
I don't mind at all. I insist.
it was like a light bulb.
the second I saw you mooning at him over polenta.
of course you're upset.
you're planning your sister's wedding...
to the man that you're in love with.
you're stuck in this creepy little love triangle...
and all the while, you're about one monogrammed party favor away from blowing your brains out.
that is ridiculous.
Oh, come on. Course you can't tell him because you're Nice Jane, you're Sweet Jane.
you don't know what you're talking about, okay?
he's my boss. She's my sister.
I am thrilled to be planning their wedding tickled even.
like I have been for every wedding that I've been a part of.
but you can't understand that because you're you're mean... and dark and cynical.
and, well, that's your problem, pal, not mine.
Pal"? "Pal"? Yeah. Uh huh.
Hey, pal. Pal." This is bad. You're calling me "pal."
Oh, will you just be quiet?
look, I get it. You're mad. I just ruined the whole afternoon...
of you pining over somebody that you'll never, ever have.
stop it! Just stop.
okay. Would you slow down just a little bit so I can read this sign?
okay. My Spidey vision's not working so good.
do you think you could slow down just a little bit? Would you leave me alone!
seriously. Crazy Lady, we're gonna hydroplane. Slow down.
come on. We are not gonna hydroplane.
Whoa!
Whoa! We're hydroplaning. We're hydroplaning!
we're gonna die! We're gonna die!
we're gonna die! We're gonna die!
don't say anything.
you got anything? No.
I said don't! Nothing.
excuse me. Uh, your pay phone's dead.
nice work. You're like one of those guys on C. S.I.
uh, any chance we could use your phone?
could I get a scotch, three fingers, no ice, please?
what are you doing? Well, it's late...
we're not getting a tow, and we're in East Deliverance, New York.
I'm gonna have a drink.
come on. There's nobody you can help right now.
why don't you just sit down, relax, have a drink?
it's been a long day.
here you go.
fine.
just one!
Ah! Okay. February 12, 2006.
the Keller wedding. You wrote a column that moved me to tears.
it was downright, flat out the most beautiful thing I have ever read.
Oh I don't remember it. How can you not remember that?
I don't remember it. How can you not?
it was the anniversary of the father's death. The brother flew home from Afghanistan.
you cannot fake emotion like that.
Oh, yes, you can.
a good writer can. You're not that good.
nice!
there's gotta be one thing about weddings that you like.
open bar. No.
all right.
so when the bride comes in and she makes her giant, grand entrance
I like to glance back at the poor bastard getting married.
cause even though I think he's an idiot...
for willingly entering into the last legal form of slavery...
he always looks really, really happy.
and, for some reason, I
what the hell are you looking at me like that for?
are you shitting me right now? What?
that's my favorite part.
Oh, my God. We have something in common.
Yes. Well, statistically that was bound to happen.
uh huh. I think you should just admit that you're a big softy.
that this whole cynical thing is just an act so that you can seem...
wounded and mysterious and sexy.
whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that last one? What?
did you say sexy? What?
do you think I'm sexy? No.
it's okay if you do. You think I'm sexy? I don't.
no. I think you think you're sexy. That's the point I'm making.
you think I think I'm sexy? Yes.
great song. I love this song.

I cried like a baby at the Keller wedding.
Mmm.
Mmm.
morning, sunshine.
Hi. Here you go.
thank you. Mmm. Tow truck's on its way.
okay.
I just want you to know.Well, you know, I never do this.
Oh, I know. No, really. Never. I never do this.
really, I know. Last night, you kept saying it, over and over again.
I never do this. I never do this. I never do this.
I never do this. I never...Okay.
I just wanted you to know.
no. No, I do. It's true.
here's your order. Thank you.
anything else? No, thank you.
HHHey! It's "Bennie and the Jets."
re # BBBBennie and the Jets #
#Bennie ##
you guys Oh. That was awesome. Oh, thanks.
all right. I'll see you later. Okay.
Oh, my God. I sang "Bennie and the Jets" last night, didn't I?
Mm hmm. Very loudly.
and, might I say, you were a little pitch.
I'm sorry. Me? What about you?
you hit notes only dogs can hear. What?
truly. Truly high pitched.
no. I was in key, at least though, right?
my God. You're that girl.
Yeah, I'm Bennie. He's the Jets.
Hey, it's the girl from the paper.
what paper?
shit.
always, Always, Always a Bridesmaid by "Malcolm Doyle"?
what is this?
Jane Oh, my God! Let me...Let me explain. Oh, my God.
Jane.
Jane!
look, I told my editor not to run it.
nobody reads that section anyway.
come on. Will you please just...
what the hell happened? You said you were gonna hold it.
well, you don't make those decisions. I do.
Oh, God. I didn't even get a chance to tell her it was running. She was ambushed.
Hey, I gave you 24 inches in the Sunday paper.
the only thing you should be saying to me right now is "I love you."
Oh! How could you let this happen to me? What?
if Jane is the prototypical, accommodating bridesmaid...
then her sister, Tess, is cast as the overbearing, overindulged bridetobe...
who at any moment, one worries, might start stomping around Manhattan...
breathing fire and swatting planes from the sky.
I had no idea he was writing an article about me.
you? He called me "Bride zilla" in the New York Frickin' Journal!
I could tear him apart, I swear. I could tear him apart limb from limb.
what? Can I speak to Jane, please?
the only person that you're gonna be speaking to is my attorney!
and I don't even have an attorney, but I'm sure gonna get one!
asshole!
I gotta get outta here.
Oh, but you better alert Traffic Control...
because Bridezilla's on the loose!
Kevin Kevin
Kevin, stop calling me!
before you say anything, can you just not say anything?
I don't understand.
to what are you referring?
Oh, come on. It's no big deal.
it's just an article... on the front page of the section...
with a million pictures of you on it.
who's upset? Jane.
let me just explain. I had no idea what he was writing.
Jane, the guy was a jerk. Okay? He took advantage of you.
don't worry about it. I know. I just I feel like I should've seen it coming.
I'm so sorry. Would you please stop apologizing?
the only reason I called you in here was to make sure that you're okay.
Oh. Well, I've been better.
I'm just trying to get through it.
look. I wouldn't worry about it, all right?
does anybody read that section anyhow? No.
so after we hem it, I wouldn't...
Jane, is that you? Yep.
we'll talk about it after. Hi. Hi.
Hi, Sue. Hi.
so, listen. I've been doing a lot of thinking about the article fiasco...
and I've decided to forgive you.
Mmm. You're just very trusting...
and it's not your fault, I guess. Mmkay.
that's very big of you, Tess. Thank you.
wait. Are you checking me off your list?
um, about the slide show, I know exactly what I want you to say.
so I wrote out a script. And Dad says that you have all the family photos.
Yep. Mm hmm. So I'm gonna send you George's as well.
um, here. Please say this and only this.
cause we don't want to be embarrassed again. Okay. You got it.
here it is.
step in. Okay.
Yep. There you go.
it's beautiful. You might have to unbutton that back.
one second. Okay.
perfect. So what do you think?
I I thought you were wearing Mom's dress.
it is Mom's dress. Well, parts of it.
it was just so oldfashioned, you know? So we could just use a few pieces here and there.
parts? Mm hmm. Yeah.
like this, and the lace.
you cut up Mom's wedding dress?
well, technically Mary Ella did.
but don't worry. We saved you the rest.
and, I mean, if you want, you can wear this...
as long as a silhouette's still in fashion.
Mary Ella, I think just the bottom needs to be hemmed a little bit.
no, no, no, no.
No!
okay, fine. You don't have to wear it.
God, you don't care.
you don't care about anyone but yourself, do you?
I have made excuses for you because Mom died when you were little.
but enough is enough!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I can't undo what you've just done.
but I won't let you hurt George.
he thinks he knows the truth about you, but all he knows are the lies you've told him.
you even had Pedro keep a secret from George.
you tell him the truth right now!
he is not one of your Euro trash boyfriends, Tess.
he is a good person.
and you cannot start a relationship based on lies.
Oh, really, Jane?
and you know this because of all your successful relationships?
you tell him the truth, or I will.
no, you won't. You wouldn't hurt a fly.
and you definitely wouldn't hurt me.
I'm your sister. That was yesterday.
today you're just some bitch who broke my heart and cut up my mother's wedding dress.
well, it wouldn't have fit you anyway.
Oh, Jane. You look wonderful.
good for you.
Oh, honey, it must be so hard to watch your younger sister get married before you.
Yes. Yes, it is.
but then I remember that I still get to have hot hate sex with random strangers...
and I feel so much better.
enjoy the party.
Whoo! You clean up good. I might even be into you.
okay. It's on the desktop under "Tess and George."
you okay? Yep.
that's not water. Okay.
okay.
Hi.
Jane, thank you so much for doing all this. It's great.
sure.
hors d'oeuvre? Yeah. Oh, look. Pigs in a blanket.
want one, Tess? No. I don't eat that stuff, Jane.
right. That's right. Got it.
well, I'm gonna go do the slide show.
Jane. Mmm?
you're only gonna say what I wrote, right?
of course. The perfect bridesmaid always does what she's asked.
not getting cold feet, are you?
what was that? With this one? Never.
Hey, everybody.
in case you haven't already read...
I have been to my fair share of weddings.
so, to start things off...
I thought you should all know the truth about Tess and George.
Tess and George are a perfect couple.
no, a divine couple.
a couple whose love is the stuff of myths.
their compatibility is so exact...
that it can only be described as having been designed by the gods.
since a picture is worth a thousand words...
I put together a slide show so you can all see for yourselves.
from the very beginning, Tess and George were destined for each other.
george and Tess have always shared a love of God's furry creatures.
as they grew up, they both shared the same level of dedication and commitment...
to their education.
nice. And civic responsibility.
#So happy together #
he was interested in international affairs.
and so was she.
whoa.
and today, Tess and George still share the same values.
#Me and you and you and me #
their love is based on a deep understanding...
and acceptance of who the other person really is.
#So happy together #
#Bah, bah, bah, bah #
the love of two true soul mates...
Tess and George.
so here's to the most perfect couple brought together by destiny.
I'm so proud of you, Baby Sister.
okay. Okay.
all right. Well, that was...
Yeah. So, um...
to keep the merriment going, um, George's "little brother" Pedro...
wanted to say a few words.
Pedro.
so, safe to say you're not a vegetarian.
George, that was taken a really long time ago.
why exactly were you wearing your engagement ring then?
thank you.
as all you know, George is my big brother.
but he's more than that.
he's my best friend.
and now George has Tess, who's who's really really, really cool...
cause she's gonna help me start my own cleaning business.
Oh. Tess told me not to tell you, George.
but I'm so excited.
so I'm only doing George's place right now.
but if anyone is in the market for a really good cleaning service...
please see me in the lobby.
thank you.
that's great. No, it's...it's not. George.
George, wait, please. Let me explain.
so what happened?
he needed to know the truth. You could've told him facetoface.
I mean, I know that my moral compass doesn't exactly point due north...
but if I say something's wrong, something's wrong.
you're the one who is always telling me to stand up for myself.
Yeah. But that's not what you did.
what you did was unleash 20 years of repressed feelings in one night.
it was entertaining don't get me wrong but if it was the right thing to do, you'd feel better right now.
do you feel better right now?
the wedding's off. I hope you're happy.
Oh, God. What?
why are you here?
you wouldn't return my phone calls. What do you want?
you want another picture for your paper?
Jane, I'm sorry. Believe me.
please. You used me to get ahead in your career.
be a man and admit it. Or don't.
but please, please don't pretend that you give a shit.
will you just please let me explain? No, it doesn't matter.
I just destroyed my life, and I didn't need your help to do it.
great! Finally.
I saw what you did in there. And you know what? I thought it was amazing.
was it absolutely, certifiably nuts? Yes, it was. But you did something, Jane.
for the first time, you were not just the perfect bridesmaid.
I'm not doing this with you again. I don't even know why I'm standing here talking to you.
you know what? Let me tell you. Look. Come here. Listen to me.
do you want to know the real reason why I came here tonight?
because I knew this was gonna be hard for you.
and for the first time in a really long time, I wanted to be there for somebody. Yeah.
all right. I messed up. I did. I'm sorry.
and I'm gonna turn around, I'm gonna walk away. I'm gonna vanish.
you'll never see me again, I promise.
but I want you to know that I think you deserve
I think you deserve more than what you've settled for.
I do. I think you deserve to be taken care of for a change.
I I believe that.
I forgot to give you this.
it's a gift...
so you don't have to carry around that crazy Filofax from 1987.
this will take care of all the stuff you need to do.
perfect for starting over.
okay. Will you take it, please, so I don't feel like such a jerk?
#Don't let your mind get weary and confused #
# Your will be still Don't try #
#Don't let your heart get heavy, child, inside you #
# There's a strength that lies #
the story got a phenomenal response.
looks like you got yourself bumped from Commitments.
that's great.
Kevin, be happy.
you got what you wanted, right?
#Don't let your soul get lonely, child #
#It's only time it will go by ##
all I'm saying is you two are sisters.
you have got to work this out. I'm telling you, she doesn't want to talk.
no, no. She loves you. Everything is gonna be fine.
okay. If you just...Dad?
what the hell is she doing here?
Tess, this is between you and her.
I'm out of this.
you know, Flo, have you seen the new weed whackers we've got out front?
the latest model.
I feel terrible.
I'm so sorry for what happened Sorry?
you humiliated me in front of every single person that I know...
and you think you could just say sorry?
II know. But Jane, you were always jealous of me.
what? Always! My clothes! My boyfriends!
stop it! You've just been waiting for the chance to tear me down.
that's not true. Yes, it is!
and you took the one thing that was finally working out.
Oh, please! This is so typical, Tess.
you're not taking any responsibility for the fact that you lied to George.
you manipulated him. Put down the bug spray.
put down the bug spray, Tess!
did you even love him? Or was it just convenient?
Oh, please, Jane. Get off your high horse.
just admit it. You resent me...
because you're the one who always had to braid my hair...
and make my Halloween outfits and go shopping for my prom dress.
no, I have never resented any of that. Yes, you have.
you always thought that my life was so easy. It was!
it is! You have never had a care in the world.
you're beautiful and fun and charming.
your life is perfect. Perfect? Are you crazy?
you have no idea.
you want to know the real reason why I decided to stay in New York?
I got fired from my job.
and to top it off, Rudolfo dumped me.
he dumped me.
and then George came along, and he was nice to me.
and he treated me well, you know?
and I just wanted to be someone that he wanted.
I was trying to be someone who deserved him...
someone he could respect.
I was trying to be you.
Why?
why would you want to be me when you get to be you?
this is a mess. I know.
Jane, you've been trying to take care of me ever since Mom died.
I had to. No, you didn't have to.
but...but if I don't then But if you don't...
then you'll just be my sister, which is what it should be.
maybe when I was young you needed to help me out. But now?
you gotta stop taking care of me...
of everybody.
Hello? Hi.
Yeah.
Yeah. It's no problem. No, of course.
Yeah, I'll be right there. Okay, bye.
you look great.
so I guess you did need to find me a date for this benefit after all.
I guess so.
George, before we go anywhere,
I just want to apologize for last night.
I shouldn't have done what I did.
look, you did me a favor.
all right, it's not your fault I was about to marry someone I barely knew.
I mean, what the hell was I thinking, right?
so what do you say we forget the whole thing? Okay. If you're sure.
I'm sure. Now, I hate to ask you for another favor...
but I need to print up my speech for tonight, and I cannot find the file.
Oh, yeah. I can get it.
Jane, I am so thankful that I could call you tonight.
I can always count on you. You never say no.
which I love.
what?
well, I I just meant...
I'm sorry. Did I ...Did I say something wrong?
Oh, God.
George, I quit.
Yeah.
I quit. What do you mean, you quit?
when I came here after college, I was blown away by this company and by you.
and I got so caught up in the job that I never bothered to get my own life.
I think I got too comfortable to leave.
then I had to be here every day to see you because I was so madly in love with you.
Yeah. Horrible.
crazy crush. Crazy.
but you'll be fine, George.
you will. You'll get somebody in this position...
who will stay for two years max, because that's what's acceptable and appropriate for this
I...I'm sorry. Really sorry.
I don't know. It just kind of, like, all of a sudden. No. It's okay.
I've always wanted to know what that would feel like.
And?
nothin'. I didn't feel a thing.
that hurts.
maybe we can give it another try. Okay. Yeah. Okay.
Nope. Not even a blip. You?
Mmm. If I'm being honest, not really.
Yeah. That's not what it's supposed to feel like.
when you're with the person you're meant to be with...
it should feel like...
wait. What is that?
I gotta go.
how many sick days do you think we can really take without getting in trouble?
if we took four in a row, we could take a whole week off and go down to, like, Cancun.
excuse me. Hello?
do you know where Kev um, Malcolm Malcolm Doyle is?
Yeah. He's covering his last wedding.
Hey. You're the girl from the article. You're famous.
Yeah.
taxi?
pier 17.
Oh, my God.
only got one dress tonight, Ziggy. So just go.
Oh, come on! Oh. Just go!
good luck! Thanks, Ziggy.
Where's the wedding? Okay. Straight down to the end.
Oh, good. Well, I got it. Thank you very much.
Mm hmm. You're welcome. Appreciate it.
Hey, pull it back!
all clear!
are you all right? I'm fine.
you okay? I'm fine. Really.
it's all good.
Oh, my God. No way! No freaking way!
you're the girl from the article.
what are you doing here?
um, well.Okay.
long story short. There's this guy.
Oh! Okay. Tell me more. Tell me more.
Kevin?
Kevin Doyle?
Oh, my God.
there he is.
um hi.
come on. You can do it. Say it.
uh, I just wanted to say...
that you were right about me, about all of it.
I just didn't want to hear it, especially not from you.
can we get a follow spot?
Ah. There you are.
um, okay.
uh, Kevin, I've been waiting my whole life for the right guy to come along...
and then you showed up.
and you are nothing like the man I imagined.
you're cynical...
and cranky and impossible.
but the truth is, fighting with you...
is the best thing that's ever happened to me.
and I think there's a very good chance that I'm falling in love with you.
so... that's it.
that's all I had to say. So... I'll go now.
excuse me. Sorry.
Kevin, I just really, um
get over here.
#I wonder why it is #
#I don't argue like this #
# With anyone but you #
#I wonder why it is #
#I won't let my guard down #
#For anyone but you ##
so Tell me, what do you think makes this wedding special?
who are you? I write the Commitments column for the Journal.
maybe I could buy you a drink later. It's an open bar.
maybe I'll buy you a drink. Yes!
Hi. Thank you.
God, look at how hot Tess looks.
think she'd go for me? I am a year older.
I don't know. I'll put in the good word for you, big guy. All right?
hello. Hi.
um, I'm the maid of honor.
I, um, live in Williams burg with a roommate...
and I just started designing my own line of deeply fabulous handbags.
and I'm completely broke. But that's okay.
I eat a hamburger a day, and my idea of a pet is a rock.
well, it's very nice to meet you. Tess.
Tess. Got it.
well, wait until you see the bride. She looks gorgeous.
ready?
everything's perfect.
and this dress the best thing is I can shorten it and wear it again.
definitely. So true.
all right.
okay. Ready?
Yes.
that day, I woke up and put on my 28th dress.
I went to a wedding where no one asked me to hold the bouquet...
fold a place card or hold their dress while they peed.
everything was perfect. And I didn't care...
because right then, the only thing that mattered...
was the person waiting for me at the end of the aisle.
and he was looking at me the way I'd always hoped.
so is this moment everything you hoped for?
no.
it's more. It's much more.
dearly beloved, we are gathered here today...
to join Jane Nichols and Kevin Doyle in holy matrimony.
marriage is a cause for celebration.
it turns out I was right about one thing.
I knew they'd all be there for me someday.

nobody ever stood up for me before.
yeah? Maybe if you weren't such a spaz all the time, I wouldn't have to.
all right, guys, inside corner of the bag.
Hey, guys...
...Iet's bring it in. Come on, to the dugout.
everybody to the dugout. - Buttermaker.
Yeah. - Remember that time I played sick, and mom went to work and then you busted me?
and then-- - You guys, sit down!
and then we went to Zuma and went bodysurfing?
we should do that again. - Sit down.
I got something to talk to you about. - Mr. Buttermaker.
Mr. Buttermaker. - What?
I gotta leave early today. We're doing leather tanning in art club.
all right, guys, listen up.
okay. Oh, another class. Great. Okay.
to Coach Buttermaker from league headquarters.
regarding player safety and league liability.
a reminder that according to Regulation 236, all players must wear a comprehensive genital defense apparatus.
now, basically, what that translates to is that if any of you guys get hurt, they're going to sue my ass so hard, they're going to garnish my turds.
so wear these things.
pass them down, sweetie.
also, you'll wanna write your names on them, because that's how you get crabs.
and trust me, you don't want to spend your Sunday afternoon picking through your pumpkin patch with a little comb.
give me one. Gotta protect the family jewels.
who you kidding? When is the last time you even saw them?
does that make any sense? - Yeah.
do you speak Latin? I'm much better at Latin.
I don't need these.
Really? - I'll take it.
all right.
he can throw all right, but you think he can hit?
let's find out. - Here.
is that all you got?
okay.
got a smart-ass here. Burn it up.
don't hold back.
Hey, what time you get off?
engelberg, what kind of diet lets you eat seven hot dogs?
no buns.
I can have as many as I want, dipshit.
my dad says the only people who put ketchup on hot dogs...
...are mental patients...
...and Texans.
chinese people count with beads.
could you please remove your hand from my space?
I think it is clearly defined by the perimeter of my plate.
Hey, cut it out, poop-face!
Poop-face?
are you kidding me?
Elmo flips better shit than you.
well, perhaps you can help me to broaden my lexicon.
perhaps.
she don't lie, she don't lie. She don't lie
cocaine
Hey, coach.
out!
three feet! He missed it by three feet!
three feet! Three feet! Oh, you want to see spit?
Yeah! Oh, that's nice.
there's spit, okay? And what are you on? I want some.
out!
one, two, three! Angels!
safe!
come on, get out of the way.
damn it!
let go of me!
watch it, asshole.
I said watch it!
let go of me!
let me tell you something-- Hey!
put me down! Put me down!
put me down! Damn it.
thank you. - God bless you, Fransois.
sorry I'm late, but I've been up to my ears in rat pellets all day.
that's okay.
thank you for coming.
no sweat.
I got you something.
infused vinegars.
don't ask me where I find the time, but I made them myself.
basil and tarragon, red pepper and oregano.
Shiso and rice vinegar.
it's...
...great on chicken.
Yeah, well, I got a spastic colon, but I'll give it a shot.
Buttermaker, you deserve a celebration.
what you have done for Toby and those children, it is nothing short of miraculous.
I mean, we are one game away from the championships.
it's...
...unbelievable. It's...
Congratulations. Thank you.
well, the kids are great. They really are.
so, it's, you know, kind of their deal.
you know, I have to admit that while growing up, I was never much for sports, or the sports-type, really.
but since I've been watching you turn the team around,
I have been thinking a lot about you.
I have that effect on women.
really. - Yeah.
well, I haven't paid for sex in years.
I think a lot of it has to do with getting older and...
...you know, being more distinguished.
I was thinking more along the lines of the dangerous type.
what you hear about...
...the bad boy, the sexy scumbag, the serial killer who gets married in prison.
I have never felt like that until I met you.
well, thanks.
Mr. Buttermaker.
what do you say, Whitewood?
what are doing here?
listen, kid. I...
there's something...
...that you need to do, and that's oil your mitt all the time.
so I came by to check and make sure you oil your mitt.
Really?
Oh, yeah, I'm always watching.
okay, I'll go get it.
be right back. - Good deal.
look at you.
gorgeous.
gorgeous. - I don't know, it's a little
looking good.
Hey. - What, you joined the circus?
Tanner! - Where's the toilet?
I gotta pinch a mean one.
Engelberg! These are my friends!
it all right, sweetie. I got a little butterball just like him at home.
down the hall and to the left, fatty.
what are you jerk-offs doing here?
the Giants beat the White Sox.
if we beat the Giants, we're in the championship.
Really? - Yeah, we're celebrating.
so take off the hooker suit, let's go.
come on.
I don't have to tell you who we play for the pennant when we blow past these Giants today.
right now, we're the hottest team in the league.
what does that mean for the Giants?
bad news for the Giants!
here we go. One, two, three! - Break!
Hey, Kelly, hang on.
listen, I want you to be like a vacuum cleaner out there today.
anything even close to you, you suck it up.
these boys are weak. I don't want to blow it.
we're knocking on the door, understand? Come on, let's go!
all right, guys, let's go.
way to go, Kelly! Way to go, buddy!
way to hustle. Way to hustle.
strike three!
I got it! I got it!
Hey, I told you I got it.
Yeah, sorry.
way to go! Tanner.
good job, buddy. Good job.
I am not acting alone.
Hey, hey, hey. Now's not the time to punk out, okay? Understand me?
you do what I told you, you hear me? Do what I told you.
you are not going to screw this up for me. Understand?
understand?
go get your bat. You're up.
otherwise, why are you here?
leading off for the Bears, Kelly Leak.
strike one!
come on, Kelly!
strike two! - He could have hit that.
time! Time-out.
time!
Kelly, come here.
come here.
come here. What, are you playing mind games with me now?
we're that close to the championship.
you got daddy issues or something? Hit the goddamn ball.
now get in there. Come on.
Yeah!
it's a home run for Kelly Leak.
the Bears win 2-1.
the Bears advance to the finals this Saturday against the Yankees.
way to go, Kelly! We're going to the championship!
see you there.
it's cold.
it's supposed to be cold. Just keep your arm in it.
Hey, Buttermaker, Mom's gonna be here tomorrow.
perfect.
you know, I was thinking, maybe afterwards, we can go to Tony Roma's for the Carolina Honeys, right?
right.
like I'm gonna take you little shits to a fancy place like Tony Roma's.
do you think I'm made out of money? - Fine. Just us, then.
Amanda, you really...
you got to quit trying to make me daddy, because
I didn't say that.
just friends.
you know, we can hang out.
we can go to Zuma.
go bodysurfing.
why are you talking about bodysurfing?
remember when I played sick, and we went to Zuma?
don't you remember?
no, I don't remember that.
I don't know what you're talking about.
but, you know, I was always drunk in those days, so I forgot a lot of shit.
look, the fact of the matter is...
you don't have any business hanging out with me.
I'm a damn loser, and you know it. - No, you're not. Not to me.
come on, Amanda.
I'm a drunk.
you said it yourself.
I make a living killing rats to pay rent on a trailer.
in Sun Valley.
I'm a washout.
come on, Buttermaker-- - Just stop it!
don't you think if I wanted to play house with you,
I might have called you sometime in the last three years? But I didn't, did l?
you know what--? - Just stop it!
you're here for one reason, and that reason is sitting in that ice right now.
just leave it at that, will you?
I know why I'm here.
just felt sorry for you, that's all.
I'm just saying, keep your glove oiled.
I mean, he came over to check mine.
Really? - Yeah.
Hey. - Don't talk to me.
I'm only here for them.
yo, what the hell? - What?
something wrong? - You would know, dickweed.
what did you say? - You heard me.
Hey, what's up with you guys?
he's a ball-hog! - Yeah?
well, that ball-hog won your last game.
so calm your ass down.
stay out of it, Engelberg! - Speak for yourself, shorty.
taking sides, Slim-Fast?
you got a problem, Tanner?
no, you do. It's called me putting a foot up your ass.
guys, come on!
break it up! - Hey!
Hey!
break it up! - Break it up!
come on, come on, come on.
get up, get up.
get up!
now, stand still and listen to me.
I said stop it. Okay?
now, what the hell is going on?
he's a dick. He thinks he's better than us.
who? - Him.
he is. How do you think we got this far?
wasn't your playing, that's for sure.
I don't need this crap, I'm out.
come here. - No, stop.
you stand still. Stop it! Stop it!
I said stop it!
now, I told him to cover for you.
so if you're going to yell at somebody, you yell at me, okay?
you did? - Yeah, I did.
you wanna win, right?
isn't that what you guys wanna do, win?
now, quit acting like a bunch of damn babies.
because we got a chance.
pick your gloves up.
we got a championship to win.
the entire season and everything we've worked for comes down to the next six innings that you play.
how you do, and the result of that effort, is gonna have a big bearing on how you feel about yourself in the next year.
you gonna go through the world seeing yourself as a winner...
...or a loser?
because believe me, being a winner is just...
is just-- I don't know, is just better.
the way I see it, that trophy up there has got your name on it.
and those guys over there are trying to steal it from you.
whose trophy is it, Danny? - Ours, coach.
whose name is on that trophy, Sanchez?
Yankees?
take a good long look at your opponents.
do they look like champions?
not for me to say.
but no, they don't.
you're a great team, it's been a great season, but it's not over yet.
let's go finish it, huh? One, two, three!
Yankees!
all right, let's go, guys.
bears!
hustle up, guys. Let's go get them.
B-E-A-R-S! Go, Bears! Go, Bears!
go, Toby!
now batting for the Yankees, number 10, Jimmy Wilkins.
strike one!
all right! All right, Amanda!
way to go, honey.
safe! - Way to go, Jimmy!
good hustle.
that's pretty good, guys. Did you see that? Damn near got him.
way to get down the line.
if it wasn't for Kelly and that chick, you guys wouldn't even be here.
excuse me? - You heard me.
none of you can play worth shit. - Oh, yeah?
Yeah. What are you going to do about it, Oreo?
now batting, number 9, Joey Bullock.
there it is!
let's go, let's go!
take third! Take third!

Amanda, your training bra's too tight!

safe!
you okay? Come on, get up.
come on.
all right!
you okay, sweetie? - Here's what I'm gonna do, cracker.
Hey, get back in the dugout. Hey!
break it up! - Break it up, guys. Come on!
see you, Mr. Shitty!
damn right, loser!
get off him! - Get off of me!
get behind the plate. Come on. - Get back. Get back.
back on the field!
get out there! - You guys are a bunch of punks.
is this what you teach them?
you bowl over little girls like that? Is that what you do?
it's called baseball, or maybe you forgot.
don't talk about fair play when your kids are throwing punches.
it's horseshit baseball, and you know it! So you watch them, okay?
traded it all in for booze and broads, you're disgusting.
what did you say? - You can't hear me?
say it again! Say it again!
get back to your dugout, you crybaby!
listen to you, crybaby.
get to your drug-out, you... - Buttermaker, dugout!
sorry, chief. Sorry.
you want to play ball, Grape-Nuts? Let's play!
all right?
piece of shit.
play ball! - Cream it, Whitewood!
come on, Whitewood.
come on, buddy. Get a piece of it.
come on, Joe.
you're better than that, son.
good job, Toby. - Thanks.
I would've tagged you out, but I was afraid your mom would've sued the ball.
let's go, Abdul. Let's go, buddy.
keep it going.
Ahmad-- Is it Abdul or Ahmad?
Ahmad. - Whatever it is.
ahmad, let's keep it going, buddy! Way to go!
Hey, that was your play! That was your play.
get your ass over there. Pull your head out, son.
Hey, Garo, come here.
listen, you hit lefty, so he's gonna pitch you in tight, all right?
so I want you to lean into it and take the hit.
I can't.
see, here's the thing. If you get on, we're loaded, and Kelly is up next.
now, come on. Let's do it. - I just want to hit the ball.
well, sometimes it's better if the ball hits you.
it's called taking one for the team. Now, let's go. Come on, Garo!
let's go, buddy!
be alert, guys!
now batting from the left side of the plate, number 10, Garo Daragebrigadian.
ball! Take your base.
that's the way, buddy! That's what I'm talking about, right there.
that's what I'm talking about. Way to take it, buddy.
next batter for the Bears, - number 5, Kelly Leak. - Come on, Kelly!
kick some ass!
Hey, Buttocks!
watch this. - Yeah.
what are you guys doing?
strike two! - That's okay, Joey.
it's all right. Focus. Just relax. Relax!
your old man help you pee too?
shake it a little more, Joey.
don't want to get any stains on your underwear.
keep talking, fatty.
whatever.
God!
see you later, Joey.
have a nice time on the bench.
now batting, number 3.
go, baby! Go, baby! Go, baby!
watch it, watch it. Go! Yes!
Yes! Yes!
get out there! That's how you do it!
Hey, Buttermaker!
time!
what the hell is wrong with you?
why don't you just put a bow on it, huh?
it's my arm. It's killing me.
don't wanna hear it. Want Toby in?
no, I don't. - Yeah, you want to win?
Yeah, I do. - Yeah?
Yeah. - Then get it together.
number 12, Mike Van Horn.
safe!
good hustle, Van Horn! Way to beat it out!
what in the hell are you doing? This is not T-ball!
you guys watching that? Let's go, let's go. Good job.
Jesus Christ.
number 14, left fielder, Jeff Wong.
fair ball!
safe!
wait. Whoa. Hey, hey, hey ump.
what are you talking about? He got it.
the throw was here on time. That was stupid!
what, are you Helen Keller?
he was under the tag, coach.
Butterballs, stay in your dugout!
keep your eyes peeled, man. It's your job.
stop embarrassing yourself, crybaby.
it's a good call, ump. Very good call.
Garo, that was perfect last time.
do the same thing. Lean in, just get on base. Kelly's up next.
why can't I just hit the ball like everyone else?
because that's selfish. Think about the team.
I know it stings a little, but it'll be worth it. Come on.
next up for the Bears...
let's go Garo! -... Garo Daragebrigadian.
let's go, buddy.
you got this guy, Joey!
out. - What in hell are you doing out there?
get in here!
UMP, time! Time.
what the hell is the matter with you, kid?
what's the matter with all of you?
my arm hurts.
why can't I hit away like the other kids?
do you remember what it was like? The first game, they laughed at us.
now we got their backs up against the wall, they're scared of us, and you want to give up. Is that the deal?
I thought you wanted to win. I thought you wanted to be champions.
well, do you?
do you?!
look...
you're up next, Kelly. Come on, let's go.
let's play ball.
now batting, number 5, Kelly Leak.
go, Joey.
catcher, Mike Engelberg.
Hi, Joey.
kiss my ass.
time.
here comes daddy.
how you doing?
fine. - All right.
the way this guy is hitting, and the way you're pitching today,
I think maybe we ought to walk him.
next batter's an easy out.
but I can take him.
I know you can.
come on, Dad. - Hey.
do as you're told. Come on.
let's get them. Let's go!
Hey, hey! What was that?
you tried to hit him.
did you try to hit him? - No, it just got away from me.
that's bullshit, Joey!
don't you ever throw at a batter! Never ever throw at a batter!
you understand me? You never do that! Never do that.
get up.
you could have hurt him.
Shari-- - You son of a bitch.
he could have hurt him. Don't overreact.
I'm taking him home. Now.
are you kidding? It's the middle of the game.
he finishes the game. After that, you can take him wherever you want.
don't do the arm cross.
do not do the arm cross.
Hey, Engelberg...
Yes, go.
...you're on the mound.
strike two!
strike three!
going into the sixth and final inning, Bears lead 5-4.
okay, Jose, you and Tanner sit this one out.
what? - What the hell?
lupus, you go to second base.
Hooper go to right field. Prem-- Where's Prem? Go to the left.
are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure. - What?
you heard me. Right field. - Are you crazy?
I can't go out there, I'm in a wheelchair.
I thought you wanted to play baseball. - Hell, no.
why the hell would I want to play baseball?
I'm a damn paraplegic.
so you just wanna sit here and get splinters in your ass all season?
is that what you want?
if you won't play ball, why are you here?
last time I checked, this is a baseball team.
and you're all on the team.
every one of you.
so do what I said.
you guys go out there and play baseball, okay?
Whurlitzer, where are you going?
to finish the game.
not with that arm, honey. - What?
you go and put it on ice. Come on, sit down.
Toby, hit the mound.
Really? - Yeah, hit the mound.
you'll be all right.
I know you're not good at listening to me, but for a change, just sit here and enjoy the game with me, all right?
and try to forgive an old drunk for being an asshole.
all right, guys. Let's show the Yankees what bad news is all about.
look at Hooper.
I bet it's just blowing their minds.
you pitched a great game, honey. Come here.
and Hooper, the kid in the wheelchair, he goes to right for Whitewood.
what does that do to your batting order?
well, one goes to four, four goes to five, two goes to three, three goes to two, six goes to one, and seven, eight, nine are cool.
I guess you know what you're doing.
Yeah, I do.
batting practice.
all right, let's keep the rally going, guys. Come on.
Hey, Toby, you need to scoot up a little bit?
batting for the Yankees, Danny Patello.
you're out!
here we go, Ritchie! Keep it going.
you're out!
Yes, sir. Way to go, Kelly!
good throw, buddy. Good throw.
two out. We need one more out, guys. Come on.
one more out! Come on!
next for the Yankees, Mike Van Horn.
come on, kill it!
did you see that? Unbelievable.
way to go, Hooper!
the little crippled boy did it!
and at the bottom of the sixth, Yankees lead 8 to 5.
pretty impressive, guys. Way to go, Lupus. Way to go, man.
that's a hero right there.
all right.
Hooper! Come on, man. - Yeah, Hooper!
get in here. Put that thing in fourth gear.
good going, man. - Great catch.
nice catch. - All right, Hooper.
Hey, guys, four more runs, we win the game.
how about that?
Prem. Where's Prem? You're up, buddy.
I have to remind you, Mr. Buttermaker, that my batting average is well below the norm.
and what's that?
zero for a lifetime.
well, you're due one, man.
so get out there.
Really? - Absolutely, buddy.
let's go, guys. All right. - Buttermaker, come here.
excellent.
this should be fun.
listen, I'm a little busy right now.
what the hell are you doing? We had the lead, and now you're putting wheelchairs in the outfield?
I mean, you're letting Toby pitch? What are you thinking?
you know, he's your son.
Yes, and he wants to win just like everyone else.
Really? How would you know what he wants?
when do you see him, between basket weaving and ballet?
you have some goddamn nerve.
are you actually telling me how to raise my child?
no, I'm not telling you how to raise your child.
but maybe somebody should. I got a game to coach.
leading off for the Bears, number 19, Prem Lahiri.
let's go, Prem.
let's go. Keep your eye on it.
I'll be damned. Way to go! Way to go, Prem. Way to go!
safe! - Did you see that?
way to go, buddy! Way to go!
now batting, number 4, Timmy Lupus.
strike one! - Come on, Lupus.
strike two! - Come on, Lupus!
if you want to hit the ball, you gotta swing the bat!
look at that! Lupus hit the ball!
run! Run!
run! Run! - Run!
run! Run! - Run! Run!
safe! - Lupus!
all right, guys. Hey, Miguel. Miguel, you know what to do.
next up, number 14, Miguel Agilar.
let's go, guys!
you're out!
dadgum it!
it's okay, Prem. It's all right, buddy. Way to hustle. Way to hustle.
good hit, Miguel.
lucky hit.
sorry, Paco, no habla.
it means you're a bag of douche, shithead.
all right, Kelly, let's tie the game, buddy. Let's go. Come on.
now batting number 5, Kelly Leak.
let's go, buddy. Let's go. Let's go.
Collins.
ball one!
chicken!
ball two!
two outs. Come on, one more.
Hey, Garo. Garo, come here.
hit the ball, buddy.
number 10... - No pressure, guys!
... Garo Daragebrigadian. - Let's get that out!
come on, Justin!
right to him!
strike one!
come on, guys!
strike two!
one more, baby. One more!
come on, Justin!
slide! Slide! Slide!
you're out!
we won!
it was a hell of a hit, son.
I'm proud of you, man. I'm really proud of you.
Hey, who wants a beer?
what are you doing?
we're celebrating.
you deserve it. - Wait. Nonalcoholic.
what's the damn point? - Just drink it, man.
there you go.
all right, guys...
I want you to listen up.
I wanna tell you something.
in all my years of being associated with baseball teams, being around them, seeing them, whatever...
I gotta tell you, this is my favorite team.
I'm real proud of you guys.
you played your asses off against...
well, pretty-- Pretty big odds.
but...
look at those little bastards over there.
Jesus Christ. Well, let's go get this shit over with, okay?
on a game like this, kids,
I just want you all to know that there's no losers, and there's no winners.
I mean, technically, yeah.
but these things, they don't mean anything.
that's some good weight. Jimmy, you wanted to say a few words?
you guys had a good season.
you started off pretty lame, but then you got better.
we just wanted you to know that you got our respect.
respect. - Right on.
and to the Bears...
...your second-place trophy.
gee, thanks, mister.
Hey, let's bring it in and give them a cheer, huh?
bring it in here.
one, two, three! - Bears!
Hey, Yankees!
you can take your crappy trophies and shove them right up your asses.
nice.
see you next year, bitches!
way to go, guys!
Hooper, I told you I was gonna make you into a ballplayer, didn't l?
good game, Buttermaker.
you too, sweetie. You too.
and by the way, I meant to tell you this. It was Redondo Beach.
what? - When we went out to the beach, surfing and all that stuff, it wasn't Zuma, it was Redondo Beach.
you wore that stupid yellow bathing suit.
you remember.
of course I remember.
next time, we'll go to Zuma. How's that?
okay.
great game. I'm proud of you.
good game. Way to go, Lupus.
this is what's called a moral victory, Toby.
now, it's not quite as good as the real thing, but it's very nice.
way to go, Garo. Good game, brother.
I told him we won.
you're looking like pieces of bacon on a plate.
it's disgusting! I smell the fat!
he scares me. Me, too.
Lillan: But he's an excellent motivator.
that's true.
what are you looking at?
Oh, Shit, he sees us. Oh, God.
Hey! Hey!
if you want to take this class, you're going to have to pay for it like the rest of these bitches!
what, are you dancing? In the park... Dance class?
you are not dancing. You are not dancing in the park!
go, go, go, go! Instructor: Freeloaders!
I'm coming over there.
is he coming? Instructor: I'm coming after you!
sorry, Rodney. We're on a budget.
Instructor: Oh, come on! It's only 12 bucks!
Oh, my God!
come on! You fucking freeloaders.
we are out of our minds. I know.
that's okay. I'm so glad that we got to do this.
I feel like I haven't seen you in forever.
Mmm. I've been in Chicago a lot.
I know. Sleeping at Dougie's house.
well, it's just closer to work.
how is it going with him anyway?
I don't know. I mean, it's fine, but I just feel like he's been distant lately.
and I don't know...
he calls me "dude" a lot.
that doesn't mean anything.
I think everything is fine.
I don't know. Anyway, what did you do last night?
what did you do last night?
you are not telling me something.
I hung out with Ted for a little bit.
I knew it! We had fun.
it was fun. Here's what I don't like about it.
you hate yourself after you see him, every time.
and then we go through this, and then you feel like shit, and it's almost like you're doing it because you feel bad about yourself.
he called me late, and we hung out.
it wasn't a big deal. And you know what? It was fun.
EW! You had sex with him.
we had an adult sleep over.
Ooh. Did you let him sleep over in your mouth?
Annie! I'm sorry!
you're unbelievable. He kept putting it near my face.
they do that, don't they?
why do they do that? Let us offer.
if we don't offer...
please. You're supposed to slap it away.
I couldn't.
you don't want to look right at it.
no.
it's too aggressive. It's like...
hello.
that's my impression.
those are the balls?
Yeah. I'm trying to make it round, but I can't because I have elbows.
he is so hot, though.
look, I know you say he's cute and all that stuff, but it makes you feel like shit, you know?
you're a total catch, and any guy would be psyched to be your man.
you should just make room for somebody who is nice to you.
you know what? He's honest!
he told me that we are what we are and we're just having fun. And I like that.
he also told you that you need dental work. He's an asshole.
I don't need dental work.
you're right.
there is nothing wrong with my teeth.
you are so beautiful.
will you marry me? Yes.
I love you.
I love you.
I don't want to go to work today. Mmm-mmm.
let's see how many times Terry's called me.
Oh! Only 15!
you know what, Terry? I don't want to pick up your monkey lamps. Sorry!
monkey lamps?
Ugh. I cannot wait to never work for a psychopath again.
Oh! Annie!
I'm sorry. I should have gone down Mason.
annie: Well, I'm the genius that opened a bakery during the recession.
they were good cakes, Annie.
thank you.
come on. Look away, look away, look away.
do you have any ideas of styles?
Oh, I don't know. What do you think, honey?
whatever you want.
look at how you guys are making this decision together.
that's sweet. You guys love each other, huh?
Yeah. Yeah.
Ohh! That's sweet. That will go away.
you cannot trust anybody, ever.
especially someone you're in a relationship with.
cause they're living with you, you don't know who you're sleeping next to. It is scary.
I mean, look at him. He may not even be Asian.
it is scary.
so did you guys want to look at these engagement rings?
we're going to browse. Okay, sure.
I'll be here.
thank you.
what was that about?
umm, nothing. They had to run. They had to go somewhere.
and no wonder. You're selling life long happiness.
you're not telling everyone about your problems and how your boyfriend left you, and maybe marriage will work out.
show me your "love is eternal" face.
no, that's two years, four years tops. That is not eternal.
Kahlua, can you come over here for a second, please?
what's up, Don-Don?
you make up the best nicknames.
you don't need a nickname because Kahlua is so delicious.
don't sue me for touching you.
show Annie your "love is eternal" face.
that looks like you have menstrual cramps.
thank you so much, Kahlua.
now, why can't you be more like Kahlua?
look, I'm trying really hard.
you've just got to try harder.
the whole reason you have got this job, Annie, is because your mom is my sponsor in AA, and I'm doing her a favor.
I understand.
Oscar, get back to work.
you shouldn't be behind the counter.
man on TV: Andrew, you are not the father!
that's great. Yeah.
stop that. Don't do that.
Hey, Brynn.
Oh, hey, roomie.
guess what happened to me today. Hmm. What?
I got a free tattoo. You did what?
I could not believe it. The guy said, "Do you want a tattoo?"
just a random...
Yeah, opened up the side of his van. No.
he said, "It's for free!" And I said, "Sure."
you said yes? Yeah!
Yeah. Look. See here?
what is it?
see that?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Brynn!
it's a Mexican drinking worm.
it's a Native American symbol meaning "wasted."
okay, Brynn, just so you know, it's...
Gil, hi. Hello. How are you?
have you seen your sister's tattoo? It's really infected.
better get a little bit of ice on it.
Yeah, a little bit.
stick some frozen peas on there.
Yeah. It can't hurt. All right.
so, I just wanted a quick word.
you know that tomorrow the rent is due.
I was getting my check, and I wondered if I could get your check, too?
Yes. I'm getting the money.
it's been a little slow.
you have to keep it in the bag and put the bag on it.
so, the check?
Yes. Yes. Yeah.
because it's a kind of, like, "needing it today"-type situation.
it's coming.
Lillian: Who is it? Annie: Me!
who is it?
Oh, my God. Hurry up, your creepy neighbor asked me if I wanted to watch the news again.
sorry. He is so gross.
please, come on in. Let me take your magazines.
welcome to the magazine and wine party. Ooh!
have a seat.
I'm very happy that you are here.
what? Because I want to eat an apple.
would you like some apple?
what is that? I got engaged.
what? He asked me last night.
what? I know!
that's why he's been acting so weird cause he's a terrible liar, and he thought he was gonna blow it.
he was ignoring me and I thought he was going to break up with me.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh!
I know!
Lil!
I'm shocked, still.
but I'm happy. Can you believe this?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I just got hot.
you did? Are you okay?
Yes. My pits are sweating.
my stomach hurts. I'm hot. What does that mean?
Oh, my God! What is happening?
I don't know. I'm wearing a ring.
I can't believe it.
Lil, you're getting married.
I'm getting married.
and you'll be my maid of honor.
God, of course I will!
it will be super fun. It's gonna be really fun.
Yeah. You know, we can plan everything together.
my God! Planning your wedding...
are you sure you're up for it?
I know it's a lot to ask and to put on your plate.
and you're going through a tricky time, and you're super-busy...
stop. It's a lot to ask.
stop. Okay.
it's fine. And I'm more than happy to do it, and it's not too much.
Oh! Look at that. It's my fiance calling.
Oh, your fiance.
Hi, baby, what's up?
it's Annie. I just told her! Yeah, she's so happy.
no, I'm not!
"yay," she said.
what, baby?
I know, I miss you, too.
Yeah, I'll meet you in an hour.
I love you, too.
Annine: Wow.
Wynonna Judd.
that's really good.
painting those giant bangs was a royal pain in my can.
and those teeth! I should have painted her mouth shut.
can you just get dressed? We're gonna be late for the engagement party.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, honey. What?
forgot to tell you. What?
I signed up to speak at AA tonight, and I just have to.
mom! No.
I forgot. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I keep telling you, you're not supposed to go to those things.
you're not an alcoholic.
only because I've never had a drink.
what? They are inspiring.
there is this one story I've just got to tell you. Sit down.
okay.
this gentleman who started blow-jobbing to get crack. His name is Marvin Johnson...
mom, anonymous. You keep... It's no names. Okay, okay.
forget it. Marvin J. Whatever.
too late. Well, he became a gay prostitute.
and he realized that he had hit his bottom.
and I have been thinking, honey, that maybe this is your bottom.
I'm telling you, hitting bottom is a good thing.
because there's nowhere to go but up.
because there's nowhere to go but up.
right? Yep. That's what you say.
Yeah, a positive message. Yeah.
Yeah. Thanks for the pep talk, Mom.
honey. Anytime, anytime.
all right. I guess I'm going to Lillian's party by myself, then.
don't talk to me about being by yourself.
I go everywhere by myself.
thanks to that new whore, Barb.
mom, come on. No, I don't like to say it.
they've been married 12 years.
okay. But she's still a whore.
I'm sure she greets him in the evening, beaver first.
I bet she got that car by giving your dad something sexually.
cause there was one thing I would never do, and I'm sure Barb is a champion at it.
I don't want to know.
it's called a "chicken coop." Of course it is.
you start at the back and you peck your way to the front like you have a beak.
and then you end up with two eggs in your mouth.
that's gross.
well, I'm sure your dad likes it.
of course, he grew up on a farm.
okay.
you sure you don't want to move in with me?
mom, thanks, but no way.
no way in hell. Yeah?
no, thanks.
think about it. Okay.
all right, I'm going to go. All right.
holy shit.
Ohh. Valet. Perfect.
sorry. Needs a wash.
you have to punch it a few times.
Annie!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Lillian. I know.
this is your engagement party. Isn't that crazy?
it's so beautiful.
I can't believe Dougie's boss is a member here.
I know, and his parents, too. And Dougie, I guess.
gosh, and me, I guess, too, now.
come on, let's go say hi to the rest of the bridal party!
you remember my cousin Rita?
Rita. Annie.
I haven't seen you since you graduated high school.
she has three kids now.
three boys. LILLIAN: They're so cute.
they are cute, but when they reach that age, they are disgusting.
they smell, they are sticky, they say things that are horrible, and there is semen all over everything, okay?
disgusting.
I cracked a blanket in half.
do you get where I'm going with that? I do.
I cracked it in half.
what?
Lillian: Annie, this is Becca, my friend from work.
we are in the trenches together.
Hey. It's great to meet you. Hey, how are you?
nice to meet you.
this is my husband, Kevin.
Hi. "Husband."
I like to say it. We are newlyweds.
Wow. Congratulations.
thank you so much.
we went on a sweetheart honeymoon. Oh.
where did you guys go?
disney World. Disney World.
we finish each other's sentences. Sorry.
sorry. Is this your husband?
no, no, no, no, no.
I don't know him. I'm sorry.
do you want to go for a walk later?
Oh. I can't.
all right. I can't. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm not with anybody. I'm here solo.
let's start it again. I'm Becca. Rewind.
this is my husband. You don't have a husband.
sorry.
and this is Dougie's sister, Megan.
Hey. Annie: Hi.
my grandma is not supposed to have wine. I'll be right back.
Hey. Hey. How is it going?
it's going great. It's going great. I'm on the mend.
I just got some pins in my legs.
believe it or not, pins in my legs, I can still do this. Right?
I fell off a cruise ship, but I'm back.
Oh, shit. Yeah, "Oh, shit."
Yeah, "Oh, shit.
took a hard, hard, violent fall. Kind of pinballed down.
hit a lot of railings, broke a lot of shit.
I'm not going to say I survived, I'm going to say I thrived.
I met a dolphin down there.
and I swear to God, that dolphin looked not at me, but into my soul.
into my goddamn soul, Annie.
and he said, "I'm saving you, Megan."
not with his mouth, but he said it, I'm assuming, telepathically.
we had a connection that I don't even know if I can... Jesus.
Hey, shut my mouth. Look at... Unbelievable.
you must be Annie's fella.
I'm Megan. It's a pleasure.
he's not... I'm not... He's not... I'm not with him.
sorry. All right.
I'm glad he's single, because I'm going to climb that like a tree.
okay. You have to meet Helen.
there she is. Helen.
Lillian: Come here!
Helen, this is Annie.
Hi! Ohh!
there she is. Maid of honor.
so lovely to meet Lillian's childhood friend.
you are so pretty.
you are so cute! You are so sweet.
Helen is married to Dougie's boss, Mr. Harris. Perry.
Perry. And they are so close now, they are literally joined at the hip.
which is good, because so are we.
I know. I'm so glad you guys are finally meeting.
I know. Me, too. I know. It's lovely.
well, excuse me, I better go check on the hors doeuvres.
but it was great to finally meet you.
it's a great party.
enjoy. Lillian: Bye.
Bye. Helen: Bye.
she's great, isn't she?
she's awesome.
Lillian's dad: And I really look forward to having Doug as part of our family.
so much so that you two should get married right now and save me a shitload of money.
dad.
everybody always laughs at that, but I'm not joking.
I'm not joking.
and here's to Doug and my baby girl, Lillian.
Cheers! Cheers!
I love you, Dad. Lillian's dad: Enough of me.
let's get the maid of honor up here.
all right. Annie?
umm. Hi. I'm Annie Walker.
yay, Annie!
I'm not going to go on with a big speech, so I'll just say this.
I'm so happy to be a part of this celebration.
and you two deserve each other, as well as a lifetime of happiness.
thank you. Annie: Cheers.
love you guys. Guests: Cheers.
Thanks, Annie. Cheers.
thank you, Annie. That was so sweet. Thank you.
Lil, remember that trip we took to Miami with the boys?
and they were working the entire weekend, and we just sat and drank wine and ate peanut brittle.
and I shared things with you that I've never shared with anyone.
and you made me realize how I can trust people again.
so let me just say,
Lillian, you are my best friend.
and I'm so proud of you.
sorry. And, Dougly...
I'm sorry, inside joke.
you better not keep my Lil on a leash
everybody raise your glasses to the couple of the decade,
Doug and Lillian.
have a great night. Dessert wine is out.
dessert wine, yummy. Excuse me.
umm...
I just wanted to say really quick that
you are so special to me, because...
well, one of the reasons is because I've known you my whole entire life.
and you've really helped shape who I am.
I know you had some other choices, but you are like my sister, and I love you.
well, that concludes the speeches for the night.
thank you. One last thing.
it's rare to meet someone as an adult who you really connect with, and that's you, Lil.
I went to Thailand recently with my husband, Perry, and there is a beautiful saying that I learned there.
it means, "You are a part of me, a part that I could never live without, "and I hope and I pray that I never have to.
and that's it for tonight. Thank you for coming.
really quick, Thank you all for coming.
I just wanted to say really quick...
dessert wine is out. Consuelo?
really quick. Speaking of Consuelo,
Lillian and I took Spanish together in school.
and so, I would just like to say to you, and to everyone here...
thank you.
thank you. I feel so close to you and can trust you.
you are my angel and soul mate.
and I feel I can communicate with you with simply a look.
thank you for coming.
here, I'll take that. I'll take that.
Yep, I got it.
Lillian...
keep smiling, keep shining
knowing you can always count on me
for sure
that's what friends are for
in good times and bad times
in good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
I'll be on your side forever more
that's what friends are for
that's what friends are for
Lillian: Man, engagement parties rule.
it made me feel awesome, like I can go out and catch another dude to marry.
so, what's up with her, anyway? With Helen?
what? I'm just like...
I don't know. She's in your wedding and you've only known her eight months, though, right?
come on. Get it out, get it all out.
I'm just... Like, the whole gown, and the... thing.
it's just weird, right? You know what?
she's actually really cool, Annie.
she's really... She's a good one. I'm telling you.
well, I'm sure if you like her, I will like her.
you have to just get to know her.
Yeah. Which I think you really should.
and... Will you just do me a favor?
would you just hang out with her once, just the two of you. All right?
as a favor to me.
okay, I will.
I love you, Annie Lou. I love you, too.
Bye. Bye.
Oh. Hi, I'm Helen.
you live in Milwaukee? I'm sorry.
have you met Lillian? She's my best friend.
Yeah, I know. We've only known each other for five minutes.
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Cute.
no. No. Come on.
see? Okay? I'm not drunk. I told you.
so, you are just a terrible sober driver?
ha ha. Very funny. Can I stop walking now?
you can stop walking when I tell you to stop walking.
Hey, look. If I was drunk, would I be able to do this?
stop it. Stop it. Please, stop.
please, stop. I believe you. You are not drunk.
but I'm still gonna have to give you a ticket.
what? Why?
it's a funny thing about brake lights. You have to have them.
I knew it. God, those have been out for a year.
I'm so stupid.
look, please.
please, I promise I will get them fixed.
this week, I promise. Please. Do you have to give me a ticket?
Yes. License and registration, please.
Thanks.
look at that, you live on Wynnewood Drive.
Yep. We are neighbors.
I just live over on Ashley. Ahh.
I used to work on Ashley.
you did? Where?
I had a bakery on the main part of the street there.
Oh. Cake Baby.
you are Cake Baby! Yeah!
Yeah, you had your sign. It was your face.
Yeah! That was you?
that was me.
you made good cakes.
Thanks.
you used to make these little pastry things, and you'd put something in them, like a cream or a custard...
cream puffs.
cream puffs, that's what you call them. Delicious.
I used to get served by this tall, broad guy, with, like, a wormy face.
Yeah, that was my boyfriend.
sorry. No, no. It was...
he was my boyfriend, and then he left me when the business went under. So, anyway...
you're kidding?
what a dick.
I'm glad I never tipped him.
you know what? Let's forget about this.
let's just forget this one. Really?
under one condition. What? What?
get your taillights fixed...
I promise. I promise I will. I promise. Thank you.
...before you kill someone.
I'm not going to kill anybody.
all right. Here, there's your ID.
and I'm going to give you this.
it's a buddy of mine. He has a body shop in Milwaukee.
he'll fix those right up for you.
bill Cozbi?
Yeah, with a "Z."
different guy. Yeah.
and don't mention the whole "Bill Cosby" thing to him.
it drives him nuts. I mean it.
okay, I get it. Thanks.
you know what? If you mention my name, that I referred you, he'll give you a particularly good deal.
my gosh. Thank you.
I really appreciate it. Thanks.
okay. Well, I appreciated your cakes.
so, we are even.
that's me, there. Rhodes. Officer Rhodes.
that's really nice of you.
thank you.
we are not all bad.
what?
I was just saying, we are not all bad!
Oh. Yeah.
actually, the rest of them are, but not me.
I'm the best of them.
okay. Thank you.
anyway.
thank you.
I didn't know you played tennis.
Yeah, I played a little in high school.
I'm so glad we were able to do this.
I'm really glad we could do this, too. It's nice we get to hang out.
I know, right? Yeah.
it's too bad Lillian couldn't play with us today.
poor thing, she is so busy.
Ohh. I know.
but she's not really that into sports.
she certainly enjoys playing tennis now.
it's funny how people change, isn't it?
Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Do people really change?
I think they do.
Yeah, but, I mean, they still stay who they are, pretty much.
I think we change all the time.
I think we stay the same, but grow, I guess, a little bit.
I think if you are growing, then you are changing.
but, I mean, we are changing from who we are, which we always stay as.
not really, I don't think so.
I think so. I don't.
Annie! These are my kids.
step-kids. Step.
they are so hilarious.
funny.
excuse me, my husband's kids.
Hellen: What are you guys up to?
going to the snack bar.
awesome. You need a ride home later?
fuck off, Helen.
okay. Put a quarter in the swear-jar.
good to see you.
they are so cute.
sweet kids.
Carol!
get your shit together, Carol!
Yes!
I've seen better tennis playing in a tampon commercial.
umm...
I've been thinking, and...
brynn needs to start paying rent. That's it.
she's been here long enough.
the three of us live here, it's not fair for me to be paying half.
we split it three ways. What do you say?
well, she can't work. She's on a tourist visa.
Yeah. So, technically, I'm only allowed to tour.
well, you know...
I have no way of earning money, unless I just go and prostitute down on the street.
I don't want you to do that, no.
Yeah, but we... "Put your American sausage "in my English McMuffin.
no, we did that. All right.
okay, I don't even know what you're talking about anymore.
there's three people living here. Yeah.
Brynn: I'm not. ...she has to leave.
is this about the diary again?
what diary?
your diary proved very interesting to read.
you read my... You read my journal?
at first, I did not know that it was your diary.
I thought it was a very sad, hand-written book.
what? That does not make any...
but, because of the deep personal details and the bits that mentioned Gil and Brynn... Annie: No, no, no, no.
don't read my journal! Gil: And the crumbs.
then... Don't go in my room!
well, hello! I think, before you make those sort of demands, you need to, maybe, think about putting a note on your door saying, "Do not come into my room, read my diary and wear my clothes."
Becca: Wow, I've never been to this part of town before.
look, you can get your checks cashed next door.
I know it looks a little scary on the outside, but the food is really good, authentic Brazilian.
annie: I'm telling you, this is where Brazilians come to eat.
I got to say, Annie's really good at this.
she always drags me to the weirdest places and the food is always incredible.
and plus, you get a lot for your money, too. So that's good.
all right. Let's do it.
let's do it.
somebody likes Brazilian food.
to my bridesmaids.
Cheers. ALL: Cheers.
cheers to Lil!
this is such a stone-cold pack of weirdos, and I'm so proud.
and I just want to toast all of you ladies.
I'm so happy to get to know you guys, and happy to say that I have four new friends.
Absolutely. Cheers.
so, Annie, do you have a date for the wedding?
um...
I don't... I don't think I'm bringing anybody, I guess.
please, can I set you up? Please?
Annie, you can't go to the wedding alone. Please?
if you go alone, people might think you're a prostitute.
maybe.
I'm sorry.
I hope that you're all hungry for churrasco Brasil. What would you like?
Yeah, I'll have some of that, please.
I'll start with this.
I'd say yes. Hello, chicken.
this is crazy good, ya'II.
Helen, aren't you eating any meat?
it's not good to eat a big meal before a fitting.
I feel a bit bloated, so...
not me.
Helen: No? No. Physically, I don't bloat.
lucky. That is lucky.
it's a gift.
I can't wait to be married for as long as you've been married.
and to have kids.
and be a mom. Becca?
yeah?
the other night, I'm slaving away, making a beautiful dinner for my family.
my youngest boy comes in and says he wants to order a pizza.
I said, "No, we're not ordering pizza tonight."
he goes, "Mom, why don't you go and fuck yourself?"
he's nine.
okay, now that Lillian's in the bathroom,
I just wanted to talk to you guys about the shower really quick.
I was thinking it could be French-themed, since she's always wanted to go to Paris her whole life.
so I figured we could bring Paris here and have champagne and little cookies.
they'd say "Lillian and Dougie" on them.
we can dip them in chocolate fondue, and get cheese from the nice part of the store.
I love that. Good idea, Annie.
we can have French invitations, the whole thing.
don't you think that'd be nice?
that's adorable! That's really cute.
good. Great.
I don't know. It's really cute.
but I feel like, personally, the Paris theme's a bit, "Been there, done that."
I just feel like we can top it.
we should throw some ideas around.
see if anyone else has a theme they had in mind or something they'd been thinking of.
what about a Pixar-themed shower?
and we all come dressed as our favorite Pixar character.
that, and I'll just snowball on top of that, also Fight Club.
female fight club.
we grease up, we pull in.
Lillian doesn't know, so it's, "Surprise! We're going to fight!"
we beat the shit out of her.
she's not going to forget that.
we just fucking attack.
can I be honest? No.
I'm at home with three boys all day, every day.
what about the bachelorette party?
that's what's more important.
I've got a new tube top, I want to cut the tags off.
I'd like to take advantage of this opportunity.
where are we going? Megan: I'm going to second her.
we'd better blow this shit out. Yeah.
that poor girl, Lillian, who we're all here for, is in the bathroom probably bawling her fucking eyes out.
because she's realizing, "Holy shit!"
I've got to spend the rest of my life with Doug.
he's my brother. I love him. But he is a fucking asshole.
I think we can all agree on that, right?
we can... We'll figure it out.
I mean, I can think of stuff, and it will be great.
we just have to make sure it's really, really special.
belle en Blanc? This is the place. Great job, Annie.
Thanks. Annie.
belle en Blanc. Reservation name?
I don't have one. We're just here to shop, just to try on some dresses.
okay. Well, the next available appointment for bridesmaids' fittings is in seven weeks.
absolutely no walk-ins.
Whitney? It's Helen.
Helen Harris? Yeah!
Hi! Hi.
Oh, my God. Hi. Listen, I'll buzz you right in.
great, thanks. Okay.
hello. Welcome, come in.
you look wonderful. Great to see you.
welcome to Belle en Blanc, ladies.
welcome to heaven. Lillian: Thank you.
MEGAN: Oh, man!
this is some classy shit here.
Jesus, Megan!
I'm sorry, I want to apologize.
I'm not even confident on which end that came out of.
Whitney, back to you. I'm sorry.
anyway, take a look around. Get to know the dresses.
if you need anything, I'll be in my office.
have fun.
Oh, my God.
it's a Fritz Bernaise.
ladies, I... Oh, my God!
I just don't think we can do any better. This is...
this is beautiful. That is gorgeous.
it's unique, it's special, it's couture.
this is made in France.
Helen, this is $800.
are you kidding? It's on sale.
Lillian: Are you serious? Oh, my gosh. What a perfect combination.
Helen: You guys, it was meant to be.
Oh. That's nice.
there's other dresses we should be looking at.
Nope, not that one.
Lillian, Lillian, look at this one.
isn't this pretty? Yeah.
it's really pretty and sweet, and...
we don't want to upstage Lillian with a big fancy dress.
maybe we should just get something kind of simple.
Oh.
please do not worry about upstaging me.
because guess who Helen is friends with and who's designing my wedding dress.
lady St. Petsois JuJu.
I just sent my measurements to France, y'all.
RITA: No, you didn't.
where were you when I was getting married?
ladies, let's not decide on this bridesmaids' dress straight away.
let's let our bodies decide.
try some things on and have some fun, okay?
Yeah, let's have some fun, girls.
ladies, start your engines.
RITA: Oh, yeah. Becca: Lil, Lil.
Lillian: Amazing. This is so cool.
ladies. Ladies, if I may interject.
I just want to say you all look stunning.
that's a given. Head to toe.
but, sadly, we need to agree on one.
well, I mean, ladies, you all look beautiful.
but I just think, personally, the Fritz Bernaise is just...
I mean... It's a Bernaise.
Helen: This is one of a kind. I just...
I don't think there is a question.
no. No question.
there might be a question.
I might... I might have a question.
I think this dress would look great on everybody.
it's a great color. It's a great length.
it's fun. You can twirl.
you can move in it.
you can spread your legs apart.
and it's a great price.
this is designer as well.
is anyone else hot?
it is like an oven in here.
okay, well, maybe this might help you decide.
while you gals were in the changing room,
I happened to rustle up a two-year-old Lady JuJu dress in storage.
I had Lillian put it on so you could see what you'll be standing next to.
Lillian, honey.
my God.
beautiful length.
breathtaking.
holy shit! You look amazing.
that's a dress. That dress is so pretty it makes my stomach hurt.
Lillian,
I don't know what to say. You look...
Megan, are you okay?
MEGAN: I think...
my dress was probably just tight.
Oh, my God.
you got food poisoning from that restaurant, didn't you?
no, I had the same thing that she had and I feel fine.
Oh, my... Okay. Oh, no.
why is this happening? Nothing is happening.
Oh, my God.
RITA: I don't really care which dress we get.
it doesn't matter to me. I just need to get off this white carpet.
Oh, God. Okay. No, not the bathroom.
everybody go outside. I'm serious!
there is a bathroom across the street.
I think everybody has the flu.
shit!
I need the toilet! I need the toilet!
I need the toilet!
No!
no. No, Megan. No! No!
look away! Megan, no!
look away!
you don't look very well, Annie.
I feel fine.
are you sure? It wasn't that gray kind of lamb?
you ate a lot of that weird chicken.
was it that?
no. I'm...
I... I feel fine.
I think you'd just feel better if you threw up.
I don't have... I don't have to throw up.
I am so sorry.
get away from me!
you're not sick?
no. No?
in fact, Helen, I'm hungry.
and I wish I had a snack.
you're hungry?
I'm starving.
what did we eat?
the sink is a goner. What are you doing?
it's coming out of me like lava!
Oh, my God.
don't you fucking look at me!
hmm?
jordan almonds.
these are great.
thank you.
better?
I was... I was just hungry.
Yeah.
Annie, everybody is really sick from that restaurant.
but it wasn't the restaurant. No, no, no, no.
Lillian, where are you going? No.
I need a bathroom.
Lil!
no. No.
Lil, where are you going?
Helen: Be careful. What are you doing?
it's happening. It's happening.
it's happening. It's happening.
it happened. Annie: What are you doing?
it happened.
no. Don't you dare ruin that dress!
Ohh. You're really doing it, aren't you?
you're really shitting in the street.
we'll just take five of the Fritz Bernaises.
thank you, Whitney. They really do look better.
right. Thank you.
you okay?
I crapped my wedding dress. I crapped...
I... I crapped my wedding dress.
lunch was fun, though, right?
it was a good time, all the girls together.
is this a sign, Annie?
no. I'm just going to pull over really quick, though, because...
what?
...my tire just feels a little...
where are you going?
my tire just feels a little low.
I just want to check my tire real quick.
Oh. Could I borrow your razor, please?
thank you. Mmm-hmm.
have a good date. Thank you.
is the guy that you're going out with also over 40?
I'm not over 40. Forget it.
lift up your arm. Point up.
Ow! Sorry.
Hi. Annie.
Pete? Yeah.
come on in.
all right. Thank you.
Oh. This is my son, Tyler.
Hi, Tyler. Hi.
these things are always so awkward. Yeah.
I'm not really a setup guy. Me, either.
but Becca spoke so highly of you.
she had a lot of really nice things to say about you, too.
that's nice to hear.
I'm going to go upstairs, throw on a couple of finishing touches.
the babysitter's not here yet, so just hang out with Tyler and I'll be right back down. Okay.
okay.
so, how old are you?
do you watch movies?
are you afraid of dying?
hmm?
are you afraid of dying?
um...
I don't know.
I mean, I guess everybody is. I don't know. Why?
because my mom is going to kill you.
you're making me uncomfortable.
your hair looks burned.
okay.
are you going to make a baby with my father?
I don't... I don't know.
my grandma died where you're sitting.
she died right here?
right where your underpants are.
you wanna watch me dance?
sure.
peter: I can't do this.
listen to me. I miss you so much.
I'll come over right now.
okay, I'm not over you yet, that's why.
she's not even pretty.
I'm not doing it. I can't. No.
what are you doing? Did you eat one of those?
did you eat one of those?
I ate Saturday.
okay. Oh, boy. You know what?
something's going to happen to you. I don't know what it is, but something's going to happen to your body.
that was fun. Oh, my gosh.
you know what I was thinking?
you should come with me to Lillian's wedding, maybe.
not like that. Not like anything serious.
but just like a fun time, you know?
we can get dressed up, and we can go dancing and have a drink.
it'll be fun, right?
no. I mean, I don't want to make you have to explain to all those people what our relationship is.
that would suck for you. Right?
Yeah. I guess so.
I'm just thinking of you. Yeah.
no, it's okay.
I have someone else I can ask, anyway. So...
Really? Yeah.
who?
umm... This guy, George.
george Glass.
okay.
who is this George?
he is a very hot, nice guy who likes me a lot, and would probably love to be my date.
Really? Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
well, let me ask you this.
can this George Glass do this to you?
probably.
you know what? It's getting really late.
you should probably go. I'm going to miss you so much.
Oh.
Annie Walker.
Hi.
Hey. Hey.
what brings you in here so early?
I've just had a bad night. Boy stuff. Ohh.
do you want me to arrest anybody?
I could do that.
actually... No.
do you want to talk to a cop about it? We are just like priests.
except we can tell everybody about it afterwards.
Oh. I won't, though.
doesn't sound very inviting.
you want a carrot?
right now? Yeah.
I'll share. I've got plenty.
sure, I'll have a carrot.
okay.
Ohh. Yeah, that sounds rough.
it's going to get better, right?
I wouldn't have thought so.
you know, my sister was a maid of honor at our cousin's wedding, and she found it so stressful, her hair started falling out.
that's terrible. Yeah.
it grew back, but it was...
it was pretty gross.
planning a wedding should be fun.
you know what? If I ever had a wedding,
I'd want everybody to be stress-free.
I'd like it to be like a carnival.
like, people win prizes for guessing the bride's weight.
dunk tanks.
Yeah. You know?
Mmm-hmm. You could have elephants, and the bride and groom can walk on a little tightrope.
okay, what you are talking about there, that's a circus wedding.
it's a totally different... Right.
you missed it. Yeah.
Hey, you know, instead of stressing out about this wedding, you know what you should be doing?
setting up a new bakery!
hmm.
no, I'm kind of done with that.
what?
I don't do it anymore.
all right.
you got the ugly carrot. What?
there is one in every bag. You have to eat it. It's good luck.
I'm not eating this.
Yeah! I'll eat it.
it's the lucky carrot? No, don't eat it! Don't eat it. Don't eat it!
well, don't litter! I'll fine you. I'm sorry.
you know what? Actually, I'm going to pick it up.
it really bothers me. Sorry.
I'm sorry. It's just that I'm anal about that kind of thing.
I didn't know that you could be a cop here if you weren't a citizen.
you can't. No?
no. No, you can't.
but they made a special dispensation because I'm so tough and strong.
Oh. Right. And handsome.
okay.
you're pretty... You're pretty tough.
I am tough. You're tough. You're a tough cop.
look. You're saying it, but you're laughing.
no, you're... You're...
you didn't let me flex that time.
that was unfair. I'm really tough.
so am I. No.
Yeah. I could be a cop.
you think you could be a cop? Yeah.
okay. Yeah.
let's see. You know what?
the sun is nearly up. Let's go and see if you've got what it takes.
that's right. Now, plant your feet.
annie: Okay.
good.
and take aim.
now, put your left hand behind your head.
Yeah. And just drop your left hip.
I'm kidding. Put your arms out straight. Okay.
you want to hit the middle of the license plate.
that's where you get the most accurate reading.
okay. Okay, here we go. You ready?
okay.
fifty-eight. What's the speed limit?
okay, they were all right. We'll let them go.
you were born to do this. Look at you.
okay. All right, here we go.
you are missing some good ones here.
people are on their way to work. Why ruin their day?
okay, watch this. 48.
forty-eight. How did you do that?
it wasn't! Yes, it was.
that's never happened. Are you serious?
it was 48? Yes, 48!
Yeah. I'm so impressed.
I'm pretty impressive.
I'm very impressed by you.
Whoa! Damn!
that was 91. 91?
Yes. Can we go?
we can go.
come on, hot dogger.
RHODES: Let's get that fucker.
annie: Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
...family lake house. Perfect.
Hello? I just got your e-mail. Lake house?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's Lillian's parents' house.
we used to go there all the time in the summers and everything.
it's one of... A bachelorette in a cabin?
wait. Can you... Hold that thought. Hold on.
Hello?
fucking Helen. Hello?
Annie, it's Rita.
Hi.
listen, I need a trip that I can fantasize forever so that I am able to have sex with my husband.
that's why I'm thinking Vegas.
Vegas?
hang on. Hey!
shut your filthy fucking mouths! I'm sorry.
I'm surrounded by savages.
you know what? I should probably run. My other line is ringing.
you know, I can get cocaine from my hairdresser.
okay, bye. Hello?
Annie. Yeah?
I'm so excited. Helen just called. She said we can go to Vegas.
you know... Yeah, but we have to... We have to fly there, and...
okay, Annie, I know you are afraid of flying, but I want to see Criss Angel, but I'm scared.
which I sort of love.
can you just hold on for one second?
Oh, sure, sure, sure. I... Thanks. Hold on. God damn it.
Hello? Hey, Annie, it's Megan.
Hey.
I just had some thoughts about the bachelorette party.
okay, here we go.
easy-peasy. Vegas it is.
Helen called you, didn't she?
Yeah, she got the jump on you.
I want balls in my face.
honestly, I think it's Vegas.
I love puppets. Balls.
I guess we are undecided.
I feel so bad Annie's stuck back in coach.
I know, I offered to pay for her so she could sit in first class, but she said no.
she's too proud.
it was nice of you to offer.
no carry-on, huh?
no. Yeah, I noticed.
I noticed you didn't put anything in the overhead bin either.
and I get it.
I get it. I want you to know, protect and serve
air Marshal-style.
what?
I don't want to infringe on your privacy, man.
I just... I really appreciate what you do for this country.
and I respect the hell out of you.
that's great.
I'm not an Air Marshal. I'm going to take a nap.
awesome. Cool.
I'll take the first watch.
I'm not an Air Marshal. You don't need to take a watch.
okay.
I've got the first watch.
pilot: Please check your seatbelts and that your seat backs are in an upright position before take off.
gosh.
I am really hoping this flight is quick, and we get there on the ground safely.
I'm not a good flyer, I'm sorry.
I had a dream last night that we went down.
Yep. It was terrible. You were in it.
what? It sounds like something's happening.
Annie, what are you doing up here?
you are supposed to be in your seat.
I know. I'm freaking out a little bit.
ma'am, we're still ascending. You're gonna need to return to your seat.
okay, I was just...
Annie, I have something.
take two, you'll fall asleep, wake up and we'll be there. Here.
ma'am, you're going to have to return to your seat, please.
it's fine. Okay. All right.
Stewarddess: Ma'am! All right. All right.
Oh, my God, I feel terrible. I should be sitting back there with her.
I shouldn't be up here in first class. I feel like such a jerk.
Lil, this is your weekend, okay?
you are treating yourself. Just relax.
she will be fine. She will make friends.
there is much more sense of community in coach, I promise you.
she'll be fine.
I can't believe you've never been with anybody else.
just Kevin.
I'm sorry. I just...
Becca, I just can't help but feel bad for you.
you don't even know what you want.
I got to know where you keep the gun, man.
I mean, is it ankle, hip, lower back?
you don't... Between the cheeks, do you?
no, I don't stick a gun up my butt. That's stupid.
I didn't say "up."
I just knew of a guy, that guy did a lot of undercover work.
and all I know is he had tape marks all up and down his cheeks.
that can't be true.
people don't keep guns up their asses because if you needed to use it, how are you going to get it?
he cut a hole in his pocket.
what? In his back pocket.
you have got to get something out of your ass and you cut a hole in the back of your jeans, you want to tell me you can't get to something?
I don't have a gun for you to put up my ass to make your point.
I can put my Nano. I will show you.
I will... If you get me scissors,
I will cut a hole in my pocket.
and you will never find this again until I want you to find it.
Kevin can only have sex in bed, in the dark, under the covers, only after we have showered separately.
and sometimes, by the time we are finished cleaning ourselves, he's too tired.
and then I pretend I'm tired, but I'm not tired. I'm not tired. I'm not tired.
that's why every girl needs those slutty college years.
to experiment, get it out of your system, find out what you like.
excuse me, could I have a glass of alcohol when you get a chance?
two double Seven and Sevens.
is that...
you will like it. It's sweet.
I have to go to the bathroom.
but I heard about a woman who went to the bathroom on a plane.
she got sucked into the toilet.
sucked right in.
are you okay?
Yes.
Yeah, I just think that what you gave me didn't really do anything.
I just have too much adrenalin or something. But, thanks.
why don't you take my scotch?
it will just give the pill a little kick that it needs.
honestly, I do it all the time. Yeah?
Yeah, and I'm much smaller than you, so you'll handle it.
well, thanks.
yeah? Okay.
yummy?
Yeah, it's good.
you should just toss it back. Don't waste any more time.
okay.
Ohh. Look at that.
okay, that'll do it. That'll do it.
so you don't even have sex anymore?
no, I have sex constantly.
the sex is constant.
but he hasn't kissed me in five years.
what are you doing when you are having sex, then?
thinking about other things and wishing it would stop.
you know, sometimes I just want to watch The Daily Show without him entering me.
it's the Wet Republic Ultra Pool. No.
are you kidding?
what is it again?
Helen: There is a bar in the pool and a tiger.
Lillian: What?
Helen: It's crazy. It's Vegas at its best.
wait a minute. Is this that place that was on The Real World?
are you kidding me? Oh, my God. It's...
Hey, buddy. How you doing?
I'm good. I'm so much more relaxed. Thank you, Helen.
I just feel like I'm excited, and I feel relaxed.
and I'm ready to party with the best of them!
and I'm going to go down to the river
Wow! It looks like somebody is really relaxing now.
what are you guys talking about up here?
we are going to a restaurant tonight. I know the owner, so...
you do?
Ohh. Helen knows the owner.
Uhh!
big whoop.
let's go take a nap. What do you say?
miss, you cannot be up here.
Hello, grandpa.
I'm sorry. I just want to be here with my friends, because I'm with this group.
the sign just went off. Can't she stay up here for a minute and just talk?
Steward: Absolutely not.
coach passengers are not allowed up here in first class.
it's policy. I'm sorry.
Ooh!
this is a very strict plane that I'm on.
welcome to Germany.
auf Wiedersehen, asshole.
all right.
why don't you go lay down?
I'm going to go take a nap. I'm tired.
I think it's a good idea.
I'm looking for status on 99 Alpha, please, between Valle de Trinidad and Milling.
they race the clock in a land that defies time.
sharing an adventure in a place where reality is on holiday.
it's the most beautiful place in the world. It's the most scary place in the world.
and it's the most desolate, quiet place.
you love it, you hate it, you love it, you hate it, you love it, you hate it.
you don't wanna be there, you wanna be there.
it's like a girl that breaks your heart.
I hate you, I never wanna see you again.
I'm sorry. Can I come over?
you look up at the stars and there's no smog.
you smell the ocean breeze, you hear the birds.
you hear the whales, you hear the seals.
I think Baja gives you that opportunity to feel that, to get closer to something that's more instinctual.
it's difficult to put into words because it's an emotion.
that's what Baja is, something you feel.
what do you call a race where anybody with any vehicle can enter.
a race where 200. 000 spectators come but no one pays admission.
a race that takes 32 hours for 1. 200 people to battle 1. 000 merciless miles for a million different reasons?
call it the Tecate Score Baja 1000.
someone asked Parnelli Jones, and he said it's like being in a 24-hour plane crash.
cause the 1000, so much can go on.
think about what happens, you know, in the Daytona 500.
and they're going around a smooth track, and the pit's in the same spot every time.
you know, we got buses and cows and horses and...
mountains and beaches and deserts.
you 're in dust, you 're in rocks.
it's gullies, it's washouts, it's 100 miles an hour, 20 miles an hour.
so many roads out there, and little ranches here and there.
every one of these jumps, every one of these turns is different than the last one.
tell you what, you don't fall asleep here.
I lived it, I ate it, I slept it, and I can totally understand when other people get caught up in the mystique of it, trying to beat time itself and get to the finish line.
it's an unreal feeling.
it's only about 100 miles south of San Diego.
but Ensenada is a whole nother world.
and the closer you get to it. The more confusing it becomes.
mouse had the inspiration and Fish gave his approval.
but it was my good buddy Scott Waugh who convinced me to make this movie about the longest nonstop point-to-point race in the world.
my name is Dana Brown.
and when I thought I knew. I hadn 't a clue.
we got Dana Brown. Dana just came out of Step Into Liquid.
they are doing a feature called Dust to Glory on the Tecate Score Baja 1000.
that's Sal Fish. He's in charge.
an honest promoter.
why not? This whole thing started with a stuntman nicknamed after a rodent.
there's the odds. - Hey, we're three-to-one.
this is Mouse. A real force of nature.
somehow you always end up doing whatever he's doing.
take his posse... one legend and two childhood friends.
also getting sucked into Mouse's orbit were the Griders. Andy and Neil.
Andy won the 1000 last year.
can you bet this? - Yeah, at Caliente.
Hey, Billy, you can bet this at Caliente.
let's put some odds on ourselves. Let's go bet on ourselves.
I think in Mexico you can do that. It's not like...
who's that guy... Pete Rose?
seems like everybody enters the 1000.
they've raced everything here from Rolls-Royces to Winnebagos.
the Bago didn 't make it very far.
these racers are from all walks of life.
including the prodigal son. The Hawaiian surfer.
the father. Son. And grandson. King of the Beetles.
team Estrogen. The perennial champs.
the greatest ever. And those Indy dudes.
they don't close the race course off for anybody.
you 're out there with Joe Public, or in this case, Jose Public.
for the people of Baja. This is one of the biggest days of the year.
we can really relate to racing, off-road racing.
and you meet people, you just start talking.
start talking about the last race, the next race.
you remember this and you remember that.
you end up with four or five guys around you, and that's called picking up dust here in this town.
as the party atmosphere fades.
all the contradictions and metaphors begin to make sense to me.
this isn 't about a race. It's about the race. The human race.
which I figure is exactly how Sal Fish intended it.
the roads aren't closed. Locals driving backwards on the course.
you 've got locals racing right next to you.
you 've got chase vehicles, and they're on the course where they shouldn't be.
you know, I mean, this is not for wusses. Let's face it.
without question. Sal Fish is the Baja 1000.
he marks a different course each year.
he deals with the concerns of the ranchers. Of the police.
as well as demands of contestants and spectators.
I haven't met anyone that has the stupidity, I guess, that I have that would do it the way I do.
and I never stop thinking about this. It's a 24-hour deal and I love it.
get families together and guys with the $10, 000 vehicle and guys with the $2 million vehicle.
I could never imagine having Sal Fish's job.
having 300 people like Robby Gordon showing up there wanting to go racing, and everybody has their own agenda.
everybody plays by the same rules. They all pay the same entry fee.
I wanna make sure our hardcore grassroot guys are always at Score and there's a place for them to race.
Sal's values are reflected in a race that's open to everyone.
from the little guy to the big guy. The famous and anonymous...
all equal. All simply racers.
Pre-dawn.
air temperature. 45 degrees.
motorcycles and quads will start three hours ahead of the field.
a flurry of flashbulbs announces Johnny Campbell's arrival.
a win today would be a record-breaking seven in a row.
trying to keep loose was 62-year-old J. N. Roberts.
a true legend in off-road racing.
always gotta keep moving. Harder target to hit.
mouse arrived. He's very quiet. Unusually subdued.
mouse doesn't know this but when I was a little kid, he was my hero.
he'd go out smokin' everybody.
Wow," who's this Mouse McCoy?" Then all of a sudden, disappeared.
I started racing when I was four years old.
and by 17 I was just flat burned out.
nothing you could do about it.
you don't have any context of what you 're doing as a kid.
all you know is you hate it, you 're done, you 're sick of it.
actually that's the best thing that's ever happened to me 'cause now I love riding motorcycles more than ever.
and maybe I wouldn't have loved it so much had I kept going.
for every bike there's usually three. Four. Or five riders.
Johnny Campbell would be riding the first 205 miles before handing it over to Steve Hengeveld.
we'll see ya at the finish line.
J. N. Would ride 110 before giving it to his son Jimmy.
mouse McCoy wouldn 't run 100. 200. or even 500 miles.
mouse had a different plan.
he was gonna race the entire Baja 1000 solo.
one man 's name is synonymous for racing the Baja solo...
the Ironman. Ivan Stewart.
well, to do a 1, 000-mile race in a car is tough, but at least you can sit down and get a drink of water and you 're protected a lot more.
and to do it on a motorcycle, I mean, I can't fathom it. That's tough.
anybody can trail ride the thing for the thousand miles.
but to be competitive and do it was a whole different deal.
and I knew I looked up to him, and now, wow, I'm really gonna look up to him if he finishes this thing.
this is gonna be amazing.
people say, "Don't you worry about your son?"
no, I don't worry about him because he's gifted.
and he usually gets there.
I think Mouse is one of the best when it comes to preparing.
he pre-ran down here more than anybody I've ever seen.
supercross legend Ricky Johnson.
who's like Mouse's big brother. Had some reservations.
not because he's a bad rider. He's a great rider.
not because he was out of shape. He was in great shape.
but for those exact things.
he knew how good a shape he was in and he knew how fast he was.
and I knew if he got into a competition with other riders that are fresher, fresher, fresher, fresher,
I was afraid he was gonna die.
survival. That's all it is. You survive, you 'll win it.
soft and smooth, brother. Soft and smooth.
at 6: 30 the race began.
they'll leave 30 seconds apart.
at 6: 31 and 30 seconds. Johnny Campbell takes off.
Chris Blaze of the Honda B Team leaves the line at 6: 33.
if a car pulls out in front of a speeding car.
results are dented metal and possible injury.
if a car pulls out in front of a speeding motorcycle.
results are probable death.
which was exactly the fate of former Baja champion Danny Hamel in 1995.
only a few miles outside of Ensenada.
mouse McCoy. 6: 37.
and the rhythm of the race begins.
at 6: 46: 30. the quads began to join the fray.
mile 38. there is no flagman. No flagman.
by the 50-mile mark. Johnny Campbell had settled into his usual lead.
in second was Chris Blaze of the Honda B Team.
mouse. In an effort to show his newfound maturity.
had gone from sixteenth to fourth in the first hour.
for a motorcyclist to compete at the front of the pack he has to fully commit.
he has to hurl himself into the void.
mouse was on fire.
and just as amazing was J. N. Roberts passing riders a third of his age until our camera helicopter got a little close and J. N. went down.
we missed the shoot.
and 30 miles away. Jimmy Roberts had a sudden premonition that he'd miss his ride.
if J. N. Couldn 't get back on the bike. Their day was over.
it didn 't seem fair. J. N. 's a living legend.
winner of the first Baja 1000 back in 1967.
that was an era when as many as 3,000 riders would start a California desert race.
and J. N. Roberts would win 27 in a row.
when I was growing up, of course he was the man in the desert.
and any time we'd be out riding motorcycles and I'd do something that my dad thought was pretty good, he'd say, "Oh, all right, J. N. Good job, J. N."
so J. N. Was this mythical figure in my mind.
so when I had the chance to actually race with him it was a pretty awesome experience for me.
I wanna make sure it works for J. N.
first time back in 30 years to Baja for him.
it's kind of exciting to go riding with him.
he can't seem to get the bike started, though.
new technology. - Get it to the top of the stroke.
J. N. Won two of the first three Baja 1000s.
he'd come back to team with Jimmy. Who was racing in his first.
he just recently won the Vet World Championships.
and now here he is two weeks later racing Baja.
and then in January he signs up for Social Security.
so he's had quite a year.
don't rub it in. Hey, Social Insecurity.
Yeah.
J. N. Didn 't get a lot of time to reminisce about his past victories because Jimmy. Mouse. And Greg Tracy had him on a rigorous pre-run schedule.
pre-running is when you get to practice your section of the course.
now. In Mouse's case. All the sections were his section.
so J. N. Got to do a lot of pre-running.
I'll tell you what, the ol' butt in the last few days is taking a lickin'.
taking a licking. - No pun intended.
we still live in different states, so we don't see each other all the time.
but when we do see each other, it's usually around a motorcycle-based environment.
and he's so, like, compulsive disorder kind of...
really goes over things over and over and over.
and I can see myself when I'm by myself becoming that a little bit myself.
I love you to death, but some of your habits drive me crazy.
but the roles reverse. It's just funny. It's just the way it is. It's life.
look at the McCoys. We've seen that yesterday with them.
Yeah, they have the same relationship, kind of.
they're kind of bagging on each other all the time.
like a couple ol' hens most of the time.
what can you do about it? It's your blood. They can't fire ya.
Jimmy and J. N. Are less father and son. They're more like clones.
well, I know I'm a lot more cautious than he is.
let's try and be nice.
he's just, you know, "Yeah, pin it, Dad."
well, I don't know what's over that hill.
so I back off and roll it off a little bit because I'm gonna go home and cut wood this winter.
I got things I gotta do. Where he's just got a little more...
you gotta have a little faith, trust yourself.
I do trust myself, but that's still who I am.
I don't have it that way, but I think that comes with doing a lot and age.
J. N. May talk about getting old.
but how many 62-year-olds can pick up a 300-pound motorcycle?
no matter his age. J. N. 's a father.
and he's not about to let down his son.
by any standard. J. N. Roberts is a true motorcycle legend.
50% of a legend is better than 100% of someone like me.
when Jimmy finally got his turn he took full advantage of it.
getting all the way up to eighth place overall and not being passed for 300 miles.
J. N. 's shoulder was possibly separated. Putting in jeopardy the plan for him to ride the last 50 miles to the finish later that night.
in the meantime there was nothing to do but sit back and reminisce about the good old days.
a few of the old-time boys used to come down here and...
but long before it was a race.
just to see if they could get from Tijuana down to La Paz.
and just to find your way was a chore.
you telegraph the time you leave and you pick up the telegraph and check in your time when you get to La Paz.
that's the only way you could document it.
there wasn't anybody down here with helicopters flying in those days to follow us.
when promoter Ed Perlman announced plans for the inaugural Mexican 1000.
race legend Malcolm Smith immediately thought of two things...
get J. N. Roberts for his partner and buy a map.
I tried to get him to read the guidebook so he'd know his way.
he said, "I don't need any guidebook. I can always find my way."
on the day of the race. The press was told the first vehicle would arrive at San Ignacio. The halfway point.
at around 5 a. m.
Malcolm arrived at 5 p. m... a full 12 hours earlier.
and eight hours ahead of the next vehicle.
as evening settled in. J. N. Began his journey guided by a weak front headlight and a unique sense of direction.
I seen this light and I thought I was going the right direction, and it was a star, and I just kept following it.
I said, "There's a checkpoint. It's gotta be a checkpoint."
kept going on. I totally went to the other side of the coast, which I shouldn't have went to.
out of gas. J. N. Managed to refuel at a local fishing village.
he then crossed the entire peninsula one more time.
where he ran out of gas again.
he had traveled hundreds of miles and hadn 't made an inch towards the finish line.
we found him sleeping under a cactus.
he says, "I don't have a clue where I am. Can I follow you in?"
I think it took him, I don't know, 14 hours or something.
but he slept six of them anyway.
I'll tell you what. I don't remember half of it.
it was the '60s and '70s, wasn't it?
Yeah, the '60s and '70s were real good to me.
despite the nocturnal adventure. J. N. And Malcolm would be crowned the inaugural motorcycle champions.
you know, as you go through life, if you knew you were making history, you would've paid more attention to it.
if one man legitimized the Baja 1000. It was Parnelli Jones.
winner of the 1963 Indy 500. His presence.
along with fellow competitors Steve McQueen and James Garner.
gave birth to the Baja mystique.
and over the years. Everyone seems to have raced the Baja.
but there's one notable exception who's never managed to make it until now...
the greatest race car driver ever. Mario Andretti.
great opportunity, and so happy that I did it because I got some taste of it.
Sal Fish invited Mario to be this year's grand marshal.
his mere presence can make grown men act like schoolchildren.
mario Andretti could've been anywhere in the world, and he was in Ensenada at the Score Baja 1000.
that, to me, I'll never forget that. It was a highlight of my career.
say the name Andretti, and that's speed, that's auto racing. That's it.
and it's global. It's a universal word.
he's the best. I love that guy.
I gotta get the car heated up and my seat buffed cause Mario's coming.
he's gonna sit right there.
for Todd. This culminated years of hero worship.
a chance to bond with his idol.
Mario's, I think, taken the bait.
he's thinking, "You know, I can do this."
I want you to drive it slowly, and I'm gonna sit there...
Yeah, sure.
he took the wheel before Todd could cry for help.
there's a very good reason the name Andretti is synonymous with speed...
because it's synonymous with speed.
feeling the pre-run truck here,
I could see how you could all of a sudden find yourself in a ditch upside down really easy.
all of a sudden he's pushing the thing pretty hard, we're on the right-hand side, stuff's going right by me.
so I said, "Hey, Mario, you gotta slow down. I think there's some horses coming up."
there weren't horses coming up, but anything to get this thing slowed down.
what did you think of that?
what did you think of that? I loved it.
Todd's hyperventilating had stopped.
unfortunately. So did his truck. 20 miles from civilization.
it's died. We've got no battery.
didn't go fast enough.
you didn't go fast enough to charge the battery.
eventually a ride pulled up.
the lady in the truck obviously didn 't follow racing.
but she knew a good head for hats when she saw one.
I'm sorry to do this to you, but...
the husband. On the other hand. Knew instantly that the man carrying his dirty laundry was a living legend.
Chris and Sam, you 're my saviors. - Mario Andretti, it's a pleasure to meet you.
I've heard of you for years and years.
the couple happily drove 20 miles out of their way.
compensated with a mere autograph.
pure Baja magic.
everything goes wrong and then works out perfectly.
see, you turned out to be the highlight of our day.
well, you 're the highlight of ours, too.
mario couldn 't get over the potential in off-road racing.
it's incredible, you know, what has been developed.
but I keep saying, I mean, the imagination is the only limit.
these are for the rock stars of the Baja. The unlimited classes.
the big-money race teams that use choppers for chase vehicles.
it's the most dynamic thing you can do. You have everything you want.
you have 800 horsepower, you 've got three feet of suspension, you got a chromoly cage, you got a breathing apparatus, you got a co-rider telling you you need to do these different things.
if you could look under "macho" in the dictionary, there'd be a trophy truck.
the racer most identified with the Baja 1000
is NASCAR driver Robby Gordon.
I mean, this is his world.
it isn't in NASCAR. This is where he's the king.
and you can see everybody defer to him here.
Robby was just a kid when I took him for a ride out in Saddleback in one of the blazers, and I can remember seeing his helmet up here.
you know, he just loved it.
Robby became Baja's boy wonder.
he's gone on to make millions racing from Daytona to Indy.
but he never forgets his roots.
I left home on Sunday night, we flew out in a helicopter, got on a commercial airline, and flew to L. A.
left at 5 a. m. To come down here. We pre-ran Monday and Tuesday.
did the whole course in two days.
he was a little cocky and, you know, it probably hurt him in a lot of ways.
I know where everybody's at.
I'm gonna watch every car go by the wayside.
the car's good enough that at 75%, it's as fast as everybody else.
you know, a lot of good race drivers are cocky.
numbers are drawn for starting position. Robby got the last spot.
while starting at the very front of the line was Hawaiian Alan Pflueger in his very first race in a trophy truck.
you can't really describe it. You 've gotta experience it.
and it's awesome. It's a controlled explosion.
it's like trying to hold a piece of dynamite, keep the explosion in your hand.
it's driving that fine line where you get off that line, it gets hairy.
it gets really hairy.
but it's fun. It's fun on that line.
you need binoculars to drive 'cause you don't look at the bumps.
you just look at, you know, like an aurora that you might come off this side and hit the other side.
you 've got the ability to go so fast.
but the challenge is to be smart enough to go slow enough to finish the race.
cause any dummy can go out there and put their foot down and go fast.
but you gotta know when to lift and put that brake on.
the highways are open to all traffic during the race.
matter of fact. All the roads are.
they have things like speed limits. But since it's a race and boys will be boys. Most ignore them.
after all. Who's gonna catch 'em?
I wasn't speeding.
well, the authorities were slightly miffed.
but Pflueger immediately saw the error of his ways and turned state evidence and was deputized.
when we were listening on the radio to where the cars were,
I hear there's a bunch of cops have pulled over all the heroes in the sport and they're on the side of the road having a doughnut convention.
and just like that. Two of Baja's finest stopped 70 people and $50 million of race equipment.
meanwhile behind them. The open-wheeled brother to the trophy truck.
the Class 1 buggies. Surged off the line.
these vehicles are unlimited. Meaning the engine size is unlimited and so is the budget.
ranging between $300. 000 and $ 1 million.
these are expensive cars.
if you win. Four grand maybe.
behind the big money of the Class 1 buggies is a lot of heart.
a quality best exemplified by an off-road racing dynasty.
the McMillin family.
my dad and brother decided they were gonna race one race in 1976
for the Baja 1000, just race it once, and then sell the car.
just to say they did it, you know?
and when I was in that Class 9 with eight inches of wheel travel, a 50-horsepower motor, I really thought I was gonna win overall.
I mean, I thought, "I got a chance here."
at 74. Corky McMillin is still chasing his dream.
you know, people ask me today, with my age and everything...
I said, "Well, the only person I really have to please is myself."
and if I feel like I'm competing and doing good and hanging in there,
I'm happy, I'm satisfied.
the McMillins are a successful family in more ways than one.
and I see Corky still line up to get a shower in the morning before the race in a line at a campground behind all the guys that work in his company.
and you can't tell which one's Corky and which one's driving nails the next day.
it makes us all have something in common to kind of get together with, and it's not the bosses and the employees.
I mean, we're all just a bunch of people trying to have fun and enjoy life, and we're doing it.
he's had to miss a couple because of health reasons, but you know what?
take one race at a time, and the next race he was back.
my body thinks my brain's gone crazy.
the McMillin with the most championships is Mark.
he's also one of the most successful drivers in the history of the Baja 1000.
but it's been 14 years since his last victory.
there's ups and there's downs.
but something that I've always taken from my dad and I'm trying to give to my boys is you never, never, never give up.
whether it's at work, whether it's racing, or something you 're trying to accomplish at home with your family, we just never, ever, ever give up.
mark McMillin got off to a fantastic start. Roaring through the first 80 miles.
but once again. Bad luck struck.
at Ojos Negros he'd have to change his entire transmission.
way too early. Way too early.
it'll be a long day. We'll get a finish out of it, that's for sure.
and off the line in Scott McMillin 's buggy was a rookie driver.
his 16-year-old son Andy.
ever since like I was two or three years old, lused to go pre-running with my dad.
I started driving a clutch when I was probably six or seven years old.
I had a lot of trust in him as we, you know, developed our relationship driving and just taught him what I learned from my dad.
at first Andy had a little problem staying on course.
watch it. Remember. There's a hole here. Remember? Stop.
here. Go this way. Stop!
I think about it, and I think when I have a kid,
I'm never gonna have like the trust that he has in me.
now take your time. Take your time doing it.
but he settled down.
go. You 're running with the big dogs. Boy.
the trust that Scott had in his son was well deserved.
after a couple of wild rides early. Andy had gotten it together and was in first place in his class when he turned it over to his father.
probably hit him a little too hard. Bud.
you got it. You got it. Make some dust. Good man.
while the McMillins have fun on the cutting edge of technology.
there are those who enjoy something slightly more antiquated.
this is Class 11. which gives a whole new definition to the word "underdog."
you really get the satisfaction of talking to someone that races a trophy truck, a Class 1 motorcycle, looking at you and saying, "Oh, you race Class 11."
guy, you must be crazy.
Hey, those guys are the toughest guys out there.
you know, they've got little support, you know, vehicles that are extremely challenged, and they go for it.
that's the hardcore Baja racer right there.
these are unmodified Volkswagen Beetles.
not the New Beetle. But the old Beetle. Pre-1982.
no modification of the suspension or engine is allowed.
we are losing our dashboard.
what they lack in speed they more than make up for in passion.
it's a feeling inside of this one.
we born know Bajas, and we die knowing Bajas, too.
I think they're real men. I mean, there's some stuff that I have no idea how they get through.
racing Class 11, it's very, very important to finish the race.
sometimes there are no signs left.
our time limit is sometimes very, very narrow for us.
so it's very significant to go through whatever you have to go through in getting there, just getting there.
stand by. He's on his way. Air clear.
looks like we're going right.
by noon everyone had left the starting line and racers began to settle into their groove.
which isn 't always a good thing.
well, that's the end of our race.
isn't that a shame?
Yeah, that sucks, man.
that rock is what got me.
just the average person who has a 9-to-5 job has 10, 000 close calls over the course of a life.
it's the light that you run through.
go through an intersection and that split second later somebody runs a red light and goes behind you, you never even saw it.
down here you 're doing like all 10, 000 in one day.
I think when you get back home, after you do something like that, it's like slo-mo, life is slo-mo. Everything else, that's no big deal.
you got a job interview or you 're showing up for something big, well, what's the worst thing that could happen?
somebody says no, you know, to a sales job?
well, I just almost got killed 40 times. So not really that big of a deal.
it's key to deal with adversity.
al Hogan uprighted his truck and was back in the race.
we know it was gonna roll over. It don't seem to phase this one.
this truck likes it, I guess.
rides better now than it did before.
getting them shocks broke in from rolling it over.
Yeah.
what was that all about?
I don't know. Good thing there wasn't a rock there, though.
Mike, I'm telling you, the back end is just softer. It's just too soft.
the good Baja racer is prepared for anything.
like number 560. who did a complete roll just outside of Ensenada.
Unphased. He straightened the windshield wipers out and his daughter. Who knew a thing or two about twist ties. Got the door shut.
and believe it or not. He finished the race 835 miles later.
twist tie in place.
then you have the example of Team Hibachi.
who opted for an impromptu pit stop to demonstrate two very distinct methods of firefighting...
the hyperkinetic smother method which got the flames 60% contained.
and the much more laid-back low-altitude water drop.
but there are those who are just not prepared.
like this fella. Who lost his gas cap.
and the fire, it was about this wide when I looked back.
you got a gas cap?
we got something we could probably set up for ya.
look at that fit. That'll work.
you got some tools that are salvageable in here.
you don't see help like this every day.
you need a flashlight?
Jason, I think you 're gonna be okay, my friend.
we're pretty sure he made it. Despite some evidence to the contrary.
there are things that are impossible to prepare for.
like your engine falling off. Sitting there. Mocking you.
near the ostrich ranch. 15-year-old Kevin Denault was prepared.
his video camera at the ready to shoot his Uncle Bob as he raced past.
the ostriches were in shock. Even cars fly better than they do.
it turned out that young Denault had the only footage of his uncle's wreck.
which had taken place right in front of him at the only place their paths would cross for a thousand miles.
what a re the odds?
probably about the same as being eaten by an ostrich.
the buggy wasn 't prepared to stop in the middle of the road.
and the Volkswagen wasn 't prepared for such little room.
neither were prepared that the buggy would start from the bumpers touching and that the Volkswagen wouldn 't start.
then a good Samaritan came along.
waved along the truck. Which got its fender ripped off...
...Thus starting the Volkswagen.
a pattern had begun to develop.
there's one element that is more feared and loathed than any other...
silt.
silt is bottomless talcum powder.
when you get home, the silt still comes out of your eyes and your nostrils for two and three days later.
you can't fathom what Baja is until you 've experienced it.
explaining silt to someone, that you hit it and you can't see anything and you have to keep your foot down.
I thought I had it all figured out.
the first time I hit silt, I was going, "Oh, my..."
don't let off the gas. Whatever you do, do not let off the gas.
in Baja. Everyone agrees about two things...
silt sucks. And you should never question authority.
the civility displayed by the racers during the trophy truck debacle had convinced the police to let them off with a stern warning and an escort off the highway.
now. For some reason. Mark Post decided starting second wasn 't asking too much.
mark Miller. Already in second. Wasn 't buying it.
so Post decided to settle for starting third.
third place Herbst was indignant. A feud had begun.
ironically. The roadblock and police escort had erased the 30-second gaps used at the start of the race.
which meant a concern for safety would spawn a 20. 000-horsepower free-for-all.
nice, very nice.
alan Pflueger. Who had already been crowned the season champ in the protruck class. Was making his debut in a trophy truck and shocking everyone. He was running away with it.
go, go, go, Pflueger, go!
running second through Valle de Trinidad was Mark Miller and Ryan Arceiro.
mark Post had been knocked back to sixth place by vengeful Herbst.
but not for long.
he was roaring back. Hellbent on getting even.
bouncing past Dan Smith. Terrible Herbst lies ahead.
they hit Valle de Trinidad like something out of the Book of Revelations.
through the center of town side by side at over 100 miles an hour.
amazingly. No one was hurt.
just some metal got bent... the racer's calling card.
the only way people know in off-road racing that a car's behind you, you come up and give 'em a little bump in the back and they kind of move over 'cause they know a faster vehicle's behind 'em.
if they don't move out of the way, take 'em for a ride.
you don 't know fear until you look in the rearview and see Robby Gordon.
got Ken on your tail. He's catching up to you pretty quick here.
everything that could've gone wrong went wrong.
it's not a pit stop.
got one crazy mad driver right there.
Robby had gotten a flat but his pit crew was unprepared.
putting Robby in full tilt.
he blazed through 30 miles on a flat tire to nearly be in first place before finally getting a change.
while the trophy trucks and Class 1 buggies represent the power and glamour of the Baja 1000.
the true symbol of victory is the motorcycle.
specifically a motorcycle ridden by Johnny Campbell and Steve Hengeveld.
with six straight overall titles. Johnny and Steve stand atop a mountain with seemingly nowhere to go but down.
the pressure of winning is always there.
and when you win several times in a row, not only do you wanna do it again for yourself, but, you know, when you got a corporate company like Honda, let's say, for Johnny and Steve, they want them to win, and they know that.
you don't see it the way you used to see it when you used to look up.
you know you 've conquered it, you 've won it, and you just wanna win another one.
you expect it. You just expect it.
anything less is unacceptable.
to beat the elements, to have the equipment stay together, there's really a lot of things against ya.
I mean, I've bounced off of front ends of cars,
I've bounced off of fences, I've bounced off of cattle.
you know, it's a little bit like Russian roulette.
after he won his tenth Baja 1000.
Larry Roeseler decided to stop competing for the overall title on a motorcycle.
he felt his time was due.
the next year. Danny Hamel. Starting in Roeseler's traditional spot.
would have his fatal accident.
there is certain risks you take.
you can't live in a box, or you 're just gonna run from everything.
how do you let him do what he does?
and I said, "One, we make our living at it. Number two is, the day I tell him that he can't, he's gonna die in a car accident going up the 405 to Torrance, you know?"
I mean, when it's your day, it's your day.
he's expecting Honda 1-X.
like everything else in Baja. Communication is difficult.
it can take a while to hear bad news.
we need a new front axle and a new front wheel. Do you copy?
I copy, a new front axle and a new front wheel.
that's affirmative. He had a problem early on and clipped a big boulder and had to change a front wheel once already but the axle's tweaked and this wheel's wobbly. So he'll need to. Just like you say. Make it right.
Johnny had dislocated his thumb.
and all he wanted to do was turn the bike over to Steve and assess the damage.
only two minutes behind came Chris Blaze of the Honda B Team.
for the first time in years. Johnny's lead was tenuous.
he'd tape his hand and be ready for the next leg.
unfortunately there are accidents that require more than gauze and tape.
that's when it's time for the Weatherman.
from a repeater station atop Mount Diablo.
Bob Steinberger is the eyes and ears of the race.
score Ops, copy Weatherman. I have an emergency.
advise the hospital that we need immediate...
for over three decades. Steinberger's been head of communications for the 1000. a job he does for free.
in the early '70s he was doing relays, and he was putting up an antenna with weather balloons and someone called him the Weatherman, and it stuck.
you know, my dad's 65 years old. He climbs to the top of this 50-foot tower on top of an 11, 000-foot peak and puts this antenna up, and right over it's like a 5, 000-foot drop down a sheer mountain.
it's crazy. I mean, he's a great guy and he loves this sport.
we have an injured driver at race mile 55.
weatherman, Score helicopter.
okay. We have two injuries. Two back injuries.
we are transporting the first one right now to Ensenada.
weatherman. Could you contact operations. Advise the hospital?
we have a spectator hit by motorcycle. No pulse.
so we need immediate transfer.
I heard somebody saying they had a spectator with no pulse.
I have no comeback on that yet.
weatherman, that 's affirmation over 26. 9. spectator hit by motorcycle. No pulse.
okay, this is an emergency. Stand by, everybody.
spectator hit by a motorcycle at 26. 9, no pulse.
rescue One. Rescue One. Do you copy?
helicopter 0-830.
ETA approximately 17 minutes. 1-7 minutes.
score helicopter, copy Weatherman.
we copy, Weatherman. We 'll be on our way.
it's gonna be...
boy. It's gonna be an ETA of probably about 20 minutes or so.
weatherman.
I don't know what to do at this time.
the spectator that died wasn 't hit by anyone in the race or any vehicle in the race. But by another spectator on a motorcycle going the wrong way on the course.
my biggest fear is not me tearing up the truck, me getting hurt, it's me killing some kid, me swapping out and going into the group of people or some guy pulling a truck out and I bounce off of him and kill these people that weren't doing anything.
but why quit what you love for a situation?
you don't quit driving on the road because somebody gets in a car accident and dies.
I mean, I'm not gonna stop flying because of 9/11.
do I feel anguish for it? Yeah.
I don't ever want that, or want that for anybody.
but I can't stop my life because of it.
they don't understand. I don't understand.
I just do it. I just do it.
the Weatherman knows death is neither fair nor just.
and there's nothing to do but to go back to work.
I was concerned that he had checked out.
to make sure he's all right or are there other problems.
everything will be fine.
great. Brian passes along a thank-you to you.
fortunately there would be no more fatalities.
Jetboat. Greg Tracy. Mace. And his son Chad were on a mission.
they wanted to get to Race Mile 205 and set up pits in plenty of time for Mouse. Who was now in third place.
do I hear a bike? - I hear a bike.
no, I hear a tractor.
Ricky Johnson. Slated to race that night in a protruck.
stopped on by to see if he could help.
he's a mile and a half out. - Coming up on five...
coming up on five minutes. So we got two more minutes to sweat.
senior McCoy seemed nervous. Although he denied it at every turn.
that's a good look, Greg.
he's trying to go for that whole retro, "I'm chilling, I'm not nervous" look.
and the E. M. Erin's man.
but they know nothing other than a married man would ever wear that.
could mean every chick's man. Don't put that in the film.
that's him. - That's it, that's it.
Ricky Johnson decided to pitch in and give Jetboat a hand.
as I'm doing the tire change, he's in my ear going, "Slower's faster, slower's faster.
and that just gave me chills.
a seven-time national champion, a hero, a god to a lot of people, is helping me do a tire change.
they didn't? - No, you 're 13 miles up to the Honda pit.
I feel good, bro. I'm having fun.
relax. You got a thousand miles to go ride.
you need to just relax and chill. "No, I'm good, I'm good."
don't try to win this. "I'm not. I'm not."
see you guys at 319.
you know, he's giving me the answer that I wanna hear.
I watched him take off. You know, I say a prayer.
you know, we go down to Mexico as a band of brothers.
the Baja is a family affair passed down from one generation to another.
my dad always talked about Baja 1000, Baja this, Baja that.
wow, that'd be neat, you know?
you know, I had a real tight family and we rode motorcycles, we surfed.
my father suddenly passed when I was 16, at a point in time where a boy kind of needs some direction and stuff.
and my mom was there and she saw that we wanted to race, and so she supported us.
before, it was Honda, factory.
and so we used to run it up and down, do all the pits ourselves. So it was fun.
in Mexico. Johnny Campbell is the hero.
even more than the charismatic Robby Gordon.
it's Campbell's posters that can be found from Tijuana to Cabo San Lucas.
he takes this responsibility seriously as he's very aware of the impact his heroes had on him as a kid.
you are his idol.
yeah?
you know, sometimes you just gotta step out of the element for a little bit, think about what's really going on.
so, you know, I thought the best thing I could do is just give the kid a jersey.
it's not a replica or something that can be bought in a store.
it's the real thing. A Johnny Campbell race jersey.
Johnny Campbell's a good man. His father would be proud.
his mother is.
women in general have had a big impact in Baja.
including this year. With the BC-10. An all-woman team comprised of the wives and daughters of other racers.
we were kind of on the sidelines last year, and all the guys were out there racing.
and we kind of all looked at each other and we're like, "Why are we standing here? Why aren't we out there racing?"
my sister raced, my mother raced.
they had enough girls at that time where they raced a class that was called powder puff.
and they would race after the guys raced in whatever cars were left over, and go out and race each other.
by the time I came along, they just didn't have that anymore, and I was determined I was gonna race.
and here I am, still racing.
all of us know that we have to get the car to the next one.
and, you know, to finish first, you have to first finish.
I think also women have this image of not being good drivers.
but we always tell people on the tours that the women tend to do better than the men because we don't have quite that ego behind us, - like something to prove. - Exactly.
women will ask for directions.
a lot of times you 're taken as a joke until you go out and show that you 're not a joke.
you know, you 're taken very lightly.
call BCA and tell them we're on their ass.
I'll hit them when I have to. - Okay.
the horn was my job. As soon as we were getting close to someone, that was my job, to hit the horn, warn them, and Bekki sure rammed them.
okay.
I think they must know I'm here. - Oh, yeah.
we all have someone that we're competing against that we're related to.
and I think that's pretty uncommon, that a family can come together and support each other even though they're competing against one another.
we started off bonding when they were just that high by skiing together.
but what it really does is that it makes you friends.
and if you 're friends you have respect, and that makes for a great family.
I've always had that competitive edge to hopefully beat my husband out there, so that'd be nice.
actually having my wife compete in the event this year meant more than I ever thought it would.
she's happier, healthier, she's more just full of herself.
Bob Sutton putting together the girls' team happens to be one of the biggest moves that I've had in my little career down here.
families compete as well as friends.
when the Honda helicopter informed Steve Hengeveld that his lead had been cut in half. Steve didn 't even ask why.
he knew his friend Andy Grider had gotten on the bike.
Andy. Steve. And Johnny had been teammates the previous year on the Honda A Team.
he was one of the defending champs.
it's probably the highest notch on my wall right now, besides being a father, you know.
it's right under being a father.
a corporate decision bumped Andy from the A Team just two weeks before the race.
he and his father Neil were headed home when Chris Blaze asked if he wanted to race on the Honda B Team.
it's not about the race.
it's about being down here, having fun, being with your family.
when I say family, I mean the whole community of off-road racing.
and once I figured it out, everything started clicking and the race just went smooth from there.
it doesn't matter if you 're racing off-road or playing the piano, you try, you give your best to life.
and when you have a son that does that, it brings me to tears sometimes.
I mean, I was so proud of him.
Andy and Neil had a plan...
prove the folly of leaving Andy off the A Team.
they wanted to lead the race. Not just on time.
but physically. So they would be making first dust.
through checkpoint four. Andy had been reeling Steve in.
the once four-minute lead had shrank to 30 seconds.
it took me probably 50, 60 miles for my arms to loosen up.
but in that time I was catching Steve.
I could see the helicopter getting closer and closer and then all of a sudden I was in his dust.
okay, just take it easy. Let the pit strategy get you in the lead and see what happens after that.
if the rear tire holds. The impossible can be achieved and Andy will be at the front of the entire Baja 1000 field.
it's 22 on the highway.
there's about a 30-second split between 1-X and 11-X.
knowing that Andy had started behind him,
steve has no choice except to pin it.
and that's gonna tear his tire up, which is okay with him because he knows he's getting a new tire at this pit.
what he didn't know was that we were running a different tire compound.
front wheel okay, Steve? - Yeah.
gas only! Gas only!
gas only! Gas only!
go!
11-X. 1: 05: 55. 30 seconds apart.
1-x is right behind him.
Andy didn 't only wanna take the lead. He wanted to keep it.
the first place he led was the last place he wanted to...
the silt beds. Where a motorcycle can be swallowed whole.
he took a center line. Held it wide open. And prayed.
while Andy headed for the coast as fast as he could go.
Johnny took the perfect line.
he knew where every nook was and every cranny.
as luck would have it. One of the few witnesses of this race was the man who cut Andy from the Honda A Team.
he's riding in that helicopter.
while the course is marked. There is sometimes certain creativity.
although you do run the risk of missing a checkpoint because the checkpoints are kept secret.
a lot of racing down here is doing your homework.
part of Baja is a lot of free running.
I had some alternate ways and lines and stuff, and if I had to use them I would.
at the top of the screen is Andy's dust cloud.
for Johnny. It's like a red cape to a bull.
he's flat out at 110 miles an hour.
one kelp pocket or tide washout. And his day ends in a heartbeat.
Andy holds his lead.
miles later. Johnny tries it again.
coming up on the left-hand side of the screen.
Andy Grider neck-and-neck with Johnny Campbell.
Andy holds the lead and will all the way to the highway.
today is his day.
by this point in the race.
Andy had battled the 1-X bike for over 200 miles.
it seemed beyond comprehension.
Neil had set up Andy's pit 12 miles down the road from the Honda A Team.
for Johnny. This was the end of the race.
steve would ride the next 350 miles to the finish.
get Mark with the oil.
tell Mark we need oil. Oil.
Andy was finished as well.
Chuck Dempsey would take over the bike.
we're probably gonna need to patch it at both ends.
Hey, my radio ain't working. I can't hear Bruce for some reason.
steve was off.
he had 12 miles of pavement before he hit new dust.
go! - Let's go, let's go!
go! - Good job, good job.
make some dust!
make some dust, buddy! Make some dust, Chuck!
clear it out, clear it out.
go, go, go!
steve Hengeveld. The best night racer in the world. Was flat out.
trying valiantly. Chuck Dempsey could not close the gap.
but it didn 't matter.
because for an afternoon.
Andy Grider had accomplished the impossible.
I've had what I would consider a few moments that I felt greatness when I raced.
a lot of people, if you ask them...
if you say, "Okay, break it down. What was your best race?"
and it might not be they won, but they had a moment that you 're so present in everything that's happening...
flawless and effortlessly.
and outside is utter chaos, but that chaos is around them, and they're sitting in the middle of the tornado, the eye of the storm.
you make a correction before a reaction starts.
they're not scared, they're not afraid.
they don't think they can be hurt.
you don't have time to be afraid. Afraid's afterward.
you know, it's like...
man, I just avoided death once again.
a father and his son.
an icon and his legacy.
an epic race witnessed mostly by cactus.
no TV. No adoring crowds. Just the clarity of the moment.
a clarity that can give a racer a greater appreciation of place and of people.
an awareness of the give and take. The golden rule.
for six-time champion Malcolm Smith.
giving back is more important than any victory.
one of Malcolm 's favorite things to do is to visit a little community just outside of Trinidad.
he and his son Alex bring their bikes and buggies and give the local kids a thrill.
how can I give back to Baja some of the enjoyment I've had?
we started donating time and effort and money about eight years ago here.
they only had a little bit of one house done when we first started here.
no, it's really fun.
we come down here every year and I've been seeing kids here for eight years now.
and it's kind of nice to come down here and see 'em over and over again.
two days after we filmed this.
Malcolm. Alex. And a dozen of Alex's classmates poured the foundation for a library to be built right there on turn four.
the kids truly appreciate the time and attention the Smiths give them.
being orphans. They know it's not always available.
they are all from Mexicali, Tijuana, Ensenada.
and we have a few from the local town, Valle de Trinidad.
it brings tears to my eyes thinking of these kids being abandoned on the streets of Mexico, and now to think what they have here and what opportunities they have here.
to me that's the most important thing about Malcolm.
he wants to be here.
he wants to feel what it's to be with our kids and, you know, spend some times and, you know, give them some joy, not only the bunk beds they receive, not only the water pump they receive, or all the things they have because of Malcolm Smith.
I learned lessons from 'em, like you can never quit down here 'cause if you do, it's a major problem for you.
you can never quit on any race, 'cause then, I mean, somebody else might have the same problem you do and they might quit.
but if you don't quit, you might win.
among the original Baja racers. Giving back is an unspoken tradition.
Baja has a magic to me.
I can be kind of sick and have a backache and come down here and ride my motorcycle and be free, and I feel better right away.
I mean, the farther you get away from the civilization on these really back roads, the more the magic is.
the back roads of Baja are endless.
and a beauty can be found in the most unusual places.
take Coco's Corner.
a kingdom built from what's been left behind...
old beer cans and bent motorcycle frames.
the unexplainable. The bizarre. And the long-forgotten.
this is a place where a man 's dream only needs one leg to kick reality's rear.
of course. Coco wouldn 't tell you anything like that.
because for him. This is just his place.
and everybody is invited.
okay, you can go inside and camping, please.
Yes, this is free. I no charge nobody.
fifteen years ago. Coco was a valet in Ensenada when a car accident took his leg.
soon after. Bound to a wheelchair. His supposed friends took his self-worth.
I wanna stay in Ensenada. And everybody, he close.
he said, "You too old, you sick."
so that's why I come here.
that's why I open this place 13 years, seven...
so. Coco's Corner is a ticked-off plan B.
buy a little campground just outside of nowhere where the 1000 races past every now and then.
and in time. The pre-runners and pit crews stop by.
and Coco has them sign this book.
write or draw. As long as you make your mark.
Coco has created an off-road oasis. A kingdom where nothing is disposable.
and the only thing that outnumber the beer cans are his friends.
how are you, my friend? - Good to see you.
thank you coming back again.
while he's never competed in the race,
Coco embodies the spirit of the Baja 1000.
good luck, everybody.
Baja has a wonderful way of just grabbing ahold of you.
and you 're just looking around going, "Wow."
Where's all this coming from? You know?
actually, we have stopped just to look around.
they battle a peninsula.
a place between the old west and the twilight zone.
they challenge it not for money or fame.
but for simple bragging rights.
during the Second World War,
president Roosevelt turned to the Mexican government and said, "We want to put guns along the coastline "to protect ourselves from the Japanese.
could we not put a little paved road down the length of Baja?
well, Mexico is neutral, so they said no.
so that was the end of that.
just imagine if they'd put in a paved road the length...
if they had said yes.
maybe we wouldn't be sitting here. There wouldn't be any off-road racing.
a little water for ya.
I ain't getting my truck all dirty and scratched up.
what the hell's wrong with these people?
they're getting all hot now.
they're getting splashed all with water on their face.
it's a long. Tough day.
race for an afternoon in the Baja.
and you 'll have a year's worth of stories.
at least. That's the case for Mike and Robby Groff and Indy Car champion Jimmy Vasser.
Vasser has a relationship with the Groffs a lot like Larry Fine had with Moe and Curly Howard.
twenty-five minutes, and he said, "For sure I knew it was Robby Gordon, you know?"
and when he finally caught and passed, it was like a truck full of Mexicans going, "Go! Go! Go!"
my earliest memory of the Groff brothers was in Columbus, Ohio, at the Grand Nationals in 1974.
at eight years old, he was already a stud, and he has this leather racing jacket, and he has this patch with Wile E. Coyote holding the Roadrunner by his neck, and it said "Beep-beep my ass."
and I said, "I gotta know this guy."
and here we are.
last year's 1000 was their debut as a team.
a series of problems led to Vasser getting in the car at sunset while the light bar was still a hundred miles away.
and I jumped in the car with no lights, and the sun was going down, no moon or nothing.
you know, like a Toyota pickup... looked like they were inebriated...
were honking their horn at me trying to go around.
that's how slow I was going.
and I'm in the race, right?
and eventually, we found a stop, and I borrowed two lights off of the paraplegic Israeli team,
I swear to you.
but he said, "I'll give you that one and that one."
so I got 'em and I rigged 'em on the front.
I had two lights to go like a hundred miles, and with no front brakes, I might add.
I had to have a Lear jet pick me up. I had to abandon the race.
I had a Lear jet pick me up in the bay of L. A. On a dirt strip 'cause I had to get back to this cart banquet.
they wouldn't let me get out of it.
otherwise, they wasn't gonna give me the prize money for the season.
it was a nightmare.
I slept in the runway and in, you know, the desert.
I started reminiscing.
I started looking back, thinking about it and started telling stories to my friends, what happened.
I thought, "I had a great time." You know?
I finally realized.
took a couple months for me to figure it out... I had a great time.
unfortunately. This 1000 would give the Groffs and Vasser many more stories.
electrical problems ended their day before the sun set.
others had problems. Too. Like Mouse McCoy who got a flat tire and had to ride on it for 40 miles to get a spare.
still. He forged ahead. Mile after mile.
eleven hours straight at that kind of pace...
physically, yeah, it's tough, but more so mentally.
cause you don't wanna make a mistake, especially at night, you know.
they might find you the next day.
so it just... really, mentally just wears you down.
is that... - That's him, that's him!
reaching the halfway point of the race. Mouse is greeted by Jetboat and crew.
plus Andy and Neil Grider who waited to see how he was doing.
Hey, you 're okay. You 're fine.
I got a flat coming off the beach.
I had to ride for 40-something miles till I got up to Catavena, and then I scrounged a wheel off some dudes.
I'm having a little bit of problems with my hands, Greg.
Yeah.
they're really like this. They're locked up, man.
fresh gloves and goggles if you want 'em.
Yeah, I need a fresh...
you 're not far back. Eight came through here not long ago.
who?
eight, and 449 just passed a minute ago.
they did? - Yeah. A minute ago.
I'll get 'em back. Hey, I lost like 45 minutes.
I was third overall, back... gonna pass the guy.
started what, 16th? Or something like that.
and I was gonna pass the four... or third overall.
I was... - You 'll get 'em in the woods.
you 'll get 'em in the woods. - I'll get 'em in the woods.
but I'm feeling it.
you 're doing a huge accomplishment.
take... keep yourself hydrated and take it easy.
you 're doing great.
I was in third, Neil, almost.
I know. That's okay. You 're doing fine.
then that flat, dude. - You 'll get it back.
he's right up there. Don't worry.
it's only half over. - I know.
mouse remembers something important to tell Andy.
I had to ride for 40-something miles till I got up to Catavena, and then I scrounged a wheel off some dudes.
I'll get 'em back. Hey, I lost like 45 minutes.
I was third overall, back... gonna pass the guy.
he's telling you a story.
he was a click out of delirious.
bike's running, he's telling you a story. It was great.
wait, I got four more seconds.
I have a great story. You 're gonna love this one.
the pit crews are the backbone of the Baja 1000...
guys like Jetboat.
I was on Indy Car teams for years... Arceiro's.
at Indy, changing a tire close to the wall with a car coming in at 120, your adrenaline's pumping for about 15 seconds, and then it leaves, you 're done.
this race, just all the planning and preparation and wondering where Mouse is at, your adrenaline's pumping for about 24 hours.
and it's just the most amazing high that you can ever be on in your life.
while Jetboat chases Mouse. Others wait for their racers.
these are the pit crews of the big-money unlimited classes.
their surroundings are like a gearhead Xanadu.
and they live like firemen. Ready whenever for whatever.
we may drive by and just wave and say, "Hey, thanks for being here."
but if we need something, they're there.
you could not be a mechanic workin' full-time in the racing business if you didn't love it.
and they just... you know, it's almost an addiction.
you 're coming down here, the truck's only gonna be here for like 40 seconds.
done, and we're done. - No, we're packing up.
you gotta find something to do.
drove all this way, you gotta do something.
idle hands can be the devil's playthings.
Oh, my God!
the pit crews are forced to amuse themselves for hours on end.
as night falls. A full 25% of the field has dropped out.
and many pit crews'jobs are just beginning.
but for Jimmy Roberts. His day is over.
he's gotten his team back into the top ten.
get off. Your work is done.
good job, bro.
Greg, my dad crashed.
Greg Tracy would take over the bike.
and take it the next 300 miles into the night.
it's only half over. And Greg's a hell of a night rider.
if my dad's there, I'm sure he'll take it in at the end, but if he's not, he's gonna have to ride it in.
good job, man. - Yeah.
good job, brother. - Thanks, man.
give me your helmet.
jetboat and crew are headed back to Ensenada with one obstacle.
the first 15 miles of their trek back was on a live course.
they were going 50 miles an hour headed north.
while coming at them were trophy trucks at 140 miles an hour.
and their lights are so bright, you can't see.
and those roads are so tight that you literally have to just close your eyes.
Jesus.
and it's like a spaceship passing on the road.
around dusk. The first automobile in the race. Alan Pflueger.
pulled into the pits.
his front end was coming off.
they tried welding everything to it...
wrenches. Golf clubs. Whatever it would take.
forty-five long minutes later. After being passed by five different cars.
Pflueger's day had turned for the worst.
but the Hawaiian kept an even keel and remained positive.
down the road. Robby Gordon pulled into his pits like a tornado pulling into a trailer park.
his crew looked ready to run screaming into the night.
but Robby's not the kind of guy to stand back and whine at people.
he jumps right in there.
busting his knuckles and shouting at the top of his lungs.
it's the kind of insane intensity you can 't help but admire.
off went Robby raging into the night.
playing the beast to the beauty of the all-woman team.
they'd been in first place in their class until their transmission failed.
leaving them stranded in the pits.
Iooking far too clean. Too cute. And too composed.
when do you guys think you 'll be pulling back into Ensenada?
as the night progresses. Things just get weirder.
the crowds don 't dwindle but increase.
they come in droves.
the later it gets. The more people show up.
it's 4: 30 in the morning.
we're off in the middle...
we're nowhere near any road, and people are out there, you know, with their coolers, their little barbecue, a little fire going, cheering you on all night long.
since elementary school, our families took us there.
so it's very, very important for us that people still are waiting for us.
we have a lot of good reactions, like the Jeep... they make like bets.
is it gonna make it? Is it not gonna make it?
and once we get there, they start like celebrating and stuff, and they really pump you up, you keep going.
the Volkswagen is painfully far behind.
which for them is right on schedule.
meanwhile. At the other end of the race.
mouse. Amazingly. Was still going strong.
Scott Dunlavey was now in charge of his pits.
and he brought with him racing legend Eddie Mulder to surprise Mouse.
just trying to keep him focused, you know.
he was very tired at that point.
got some food in him, and got some liquids in him.
and, you know, he's complaining about his hands.
we were third overall, and I got a flat out on the beach.
I've been trying to gather those guys back up for a while, man.
I was pretty bummed out, cause first of all, 40 miles on a rear flat.
push it to third overall, man.
you 're rocking, dude. You 're rocking. I know.
I feel strong, but my wrists go numb.
they just lock up.
that's my issue right now.
if I could shake that flat off...
you know, it works your brain over...
I had to slow down.
hey I lost like 45 minutes.
I was third overall, back... gonna pass the guy.
go get them, Mouse.
Dunlavey and Mulder will chase Mouse on his journey to the finish line.
he's a little wrung out, huh? - Yeah, he's a little... he's pinging.
on Mount Diablo. The temperature dropped to freezing and the wind was blowing 50 miles an hour.
all hell was breaking loose.
the nearby observatory started to complain about the light that was leaking from the Weatherman 's tent.
threatening to ruin experiments that had been going on for a quarter century.
so the Weatherman put his assistant on the 30-gallon trash bag duty.
meanwhile. Robby Gordon 's day continued to unravel.
why is Robby stopping here?
because he ran out of gas like half a mile back.
we've got one pissed-off driver.
and we're hoping that he stops.
and if he doesn't, we're gonna have to chase him to the next pit.
it hasn't been a good day.
rob, how many you want? - Tell them it's pump gas only.
Tim, it's pump gas only.
No! Get it out. Don't put that stuff into my car.
get out of the way! - Ready to go.
you got 30 miles left.
again. Robby disappeared into the darkness.
joining a long list of things to be feared in the Baja night.
when you 're a little kid, and the coat rack turns into the monster, you know there's something under your bed.
well, when you 're in Baja and on a motorcycle by yourself, there is, you know.
you 're driving at night when you see a forest of cactus.
I mean, they're absolutely just flying by you, and these things look like they're alive.
they look like they're talking to you, you know?
I went to go the bathroom, so I left the car running, and then my ears were starting to hurt.
and then I saw like a light.
and I told this kid, "Check out this ligh"t.
it's like a flying saucer or something.
you 're full of it.
but it was a real one, you know?
very close... like a block, you know, from here.
but he was very, very, very scared. And I was, too, yeah.
strange lights can be disconcerting. No lights can be downright depressing.
that's what happened to Andy McMillin. With his lead so great.
that when engine problems slowed him.
he checked the rearview and didn 't see a flicker.
and then they got disoriented out there and thought maybe that they were lost.
and we got on the radio with him and said, "Andy, just put trust into your GPS."
good job.
got a left here.
kind of funky on this side. All right!
okay. You 're the most important guy on the course right now.
the storm atop Mount Diablo seemed to engulf the whole peninsula.
clear the road! Get out of the way!
weatherman. Copy. Just confirmed San Felipe.
weatherman...
we have a fire that started.
nobody knows how...
he's onto the right course.
some people have changed the course markers. Leading people astray.
score. Copy. Weatherman.
we are in the helicopter with a doctor onboard.
I need somebody to respond to me.
when Mouse had parked at 11, he didn 't talk about the usual 40 miles he'd spent getting another tire or how he'd been in third place overall.
instead he had a very specific question.
how far ahead was the bike in front of him?
that was third place.
I'm gonna get back to my goal, which was being on the podium.
I really wanted to get on the podium solo.
he had about 30 miles up in the mountains, came back down, picked up like three spots.
I mean, here's a guy that's blowing bubbles, and he just picked off two guys who were fresh.
through checkpoint 12.
mouse was only 60 miles away from the finish line in Ensenada.
he was about to make the impossible possible.
broken ribs. Slight shoulder separation. Broken finger.
in danger of being run over. Mouse crawled to the shoulder.
Baja has a way of educating you.
push that edge that far down there, and you 're done.
it was around 5: 00 in the morning when Robby Gordon.
who'd stayed in the race on sheer fury. Finally had to admit defeat.
if we were to continue down to the big bumps we were at in San Felipe, we'd basically break the back half of the truck off with it slamming as hard as it was slamming.
we made a unanimous decision to load the thing on the trailer, and that was probably one of the hardest things to do, especially all the hard work that the whole team put into getting to the Baja 1000.
if you can't win, you at least wanna finish.
and this year's 1000 we didn't finish.
a driver will often work up to eight hours to get back in the race.
when he sees the trailer. It's a feeling of embarrassment and emptiness.
why do they do t?
it's not 'cause you 're crazy or you got a death wish.
it's competition.
fighters don't fight to hurt people, they fight to win.
racers don't race because they wanna die.
they wanna go fast. That's my high.
that's the way I manipulate my life, is through mechanics of a machine.
off-road racing is chasing rainbows.
it's not like Indianapolis where if you did something, you 'd get something for it.
all you 're doing down here is just endangering yourself for the glory.
when you first start racing, the first thing you wanna do is to win a race.
then you wanna win a championship. Then you wanna win the Baja 1000.
you want all these things.
and then there's gonna be some day when you 're probably gonna win your last race.
probably five or six miles from the end I kept thinking, "Gosh, I wish it would go on."
you know, cause I don't want it to come to an end.
gimme another mile. Gimme another half mile.
I want this feeling just a little bit longer, you know.
by race's end.
27 vehicles will have placed first in their individual classes.
but only one will be fastest overall.
this is the domain of legends like Stewart. Roeseler. Smith. And Evans.
and this year's winner belonged to that company.
approaching the baseball stadium.
his name being announced for the seventh year in a row.
with a time of 15 hours. 39 minutes. And 52 seconds...
I wanna introduce to you the motorcycle champion for the Baja 1000...
steve Hengeveld and Johnny Campbell. Steve.
until you experience it, you can't really explain it 'cause it's just so great.
it has so much mystery and experiences and the stories we get out of it, and it's a lifetime of experience, each and every one.
the second fastest motorcycle was the Honda B Team that included Andy Grider.
John Gregory was fastest on the quad.
the fastest on four wheels was the Class 1 buggy of Doug Fortin.
while Ryan Arceiro crossed the line with the quickest trophy truck.
but the most impressive story on four wheels was that of 16-year-old Andy McMillin.
a high school junior who'd just gotten his license three months earlier.
Andy finished second in class and sixth overall...
the most impressive debut since Robby Gordon 18 years earlier.
I'm proud of ya. You did a great job.
great job. Thanks for everything, you guys.
what a great family. Honor to have you guys with us, it really is.
I had a friend tell me today that in Baja, if you 're dumb, you better be tough.
having survived 300 miles with a faulty headlight.
Greg Tracy's arrival meant J. N. Was back on the bike.
well, if we get third, we'll be good.
well, whatever we get. Dude, we had no frigging lights.
Jimmy didn 't need to worry because his dad had been within two blocks of the stadium for quite a while.
he couldn 't find the entrance.
when he did make it. Victory towel wrapped around his neck. Just like the old days.
well. It was 1967 all over again.
but that's what happened the first time, so that's only fitting.
some things are timeless.
there he is standing there, you know, 30 years later.
he had that smile, and you could feel the excitement of there he was, you know, at the finish line of the 1000.
and gosh, again, he could be anyplace in the world and doing anything he wants to do.
and there he is.
you can get your social security check now.
a little past 5: 00 in the morning. The number 227 of Matt and Steve Scaroni collected the win in the protruck class.
after a dozen tries. The father and son team had finally done it.
they give a lot of the credit to the third driver. Ricky Johnson.
you fall back to the little kid in the underwear and the six-guns and the cowboy hat.
you 're a cowboy.
at sunrise. Two-thirds of those cowboys were still out in the course.
some as far back as the halfway point.
like number 806 of Todd Wyllie and Mark Julius.
who'd had a rotten night.
they'd lost a transmission. Iost a front end. Simply got lost.
but could not lose Jethro the know-it-all.
you never finished a 100-mile race, you never finished a 500-mile race.
come down here, how's he gonna finish a 1, 000-mile race?
mark Julius. In an attempt to lose his publicist Jethro.
was off and running.
and then a funny thing happened.
arace broke out for 195th place.
the buggy's race strategy was hard to figure.
after closing a half-mile gap in a matter of minutes.
he simply locked onto the rear bumper and stayed there as if hypnotized.
and the one chance he had to make a pass.
he saw open air. And it scared the hell out of him.
he went right back to his happy place.
after hitting the straightaway.
the buggy couldn 't keep pace with Julius and the truck.
and where it had taken 20 hours to finish the first half of the race.
it only took him a mere eight hours to come into the finish.
Julius and Wyllie had done it.
Where's my key?
we made it. We made it. A thousand miles.
buddy.
good job, Mark.
best adventure of my life. Thank you, sir.
I couldn't begin to tell ya.
the dreams will come true, man.
where do we go from here?
rewarded with a pin. Finishers celebrate all day long.
hour after hour as the clock ticks down to the 32-hour time limit.
in spite of being denied a record-breaking 10th overall Baja 1000.
mark McMillin crossed the finish line with a big grin on his face.
told ya I'd make it back for ya.
you did. You stayed true to your word.
no, we don't give up. We don't give up.
proving that even rich handsome guys don 't give up.
alan Pflueger crossed the line with a big aloha smile.
it was up front. It was up front.
see that. Then the front broke off.
hawaiians never quit. - That's true.
same hula gal, or did you replace the hula gal?
no, same hula girl.
gotta get her a new grass skirt, but that's all right.
Yeah, I like this one.
kind of had to do some testing on this thing.
the ukulele ones last.
the other ones lose their arms, so it's all good.
although there are many examples of Baja's never-say-die spirit.
few have as good a time as the off-road version of the Terminator... AI Hogan.
you 'll be able to find pieces of his truck all the way back to the starting line.
nothing left but his pride and his sense of the obvious.
tired, man.
what can you say? That's Baja.
sometimes the course wins.
we only got 364 more days till the next one, right?
one after the other. They would cross the line.
dusty and tired. But overjoyed they finished.
as the day wore on. There were still many on the course.
Amy Thomas searched for the BC-10.
which was still a hundred miles out.
headed for home in a race against the clock.
and only seconds behind the women 's team came Eric Solorzano's Volkswagen bouncing up the goat trail outside of Trinidad.
hoping to finish. Just to finish.
wh le the vol ks wagen would n 't ma ke t, the women 's team would. With ten minutes to spare.
it was Mouse's drive to finish that had us worried the night before.
we decided to send helmet cameraman Louis Franco out to find him.
hoping he'd bring him back.
mouse was up. But not in the best condition.
lucky for him. Jeff Kaplan happened by.
I just saw him out of my peripheral vision.
he told me that the next place I could see somebody, tell 'em that he was stuck there.
and I just told him to follow me in.
but we ended up going fast. Really fast.
surprisingly fast for one light.
at speeds near a hundred miles an hour.
kaplan paced Mouse for over 20 miles until finding Scott Dunlavey.
the motorcycle's junk.
I beat the thing into submission so it was at least halfway rideable.
he's goofy, he doesn't even know if it's left or right.
he'd hit the wall, he'd pushed through the wall and kept going and going and going and got bit.
and now it was a matter to get back to some sort of semblance of focus to get to bring it all the way home.
mouse McCoy... 18 hours. 2 minutes. 40 seconds.
the sixth motorcycle to finish. The twelfth overall vehicle.
not too bad.
there were 246 vehicles behind him.
there's a connection between people who make a commitment.
a passion shared.
you let me ride side by side all the way to Ojos, man.
I'll never forget you. You got me there.
this wasn't just a solo effort.
it might've been a solo effort as far as me being in the saddle, but the collective effort was about my friends and family carrying me through it, and that's why it means so much to me, that we all did it together.
Congratulations. - Yeah, congratulations.
thank you, guys, for letting us in your country to race here.
Hey, anybody know where a good taco stand is?
a cold beer?
a cold beer and a taco is what I need. I haven't eaten much today.
it's a hell of a race.
arace against the clock in a country that defies time.
in a competition which forges lifelong friendships.
maybe only one drives. But they search for glory as a team.
they look for it in the win. In the finish. And in the attempt.
because the journey can justify the destination.
in one word, the Baja 1000 for me is... love.
it's romantic.
it's awesome.
tough.
exciting.
a challenge.
perseverance.
tough.
patience. A lot of patience.
it's beautiful.
for me, it's just adventure. I mean, it's such an adventure.
well, I got a different word, now that I'm thinking about it.
it's more mystical.
it is mystical.
it has a sense and a spirit of its own.
I think it's just life.
in one day, you kind of get to experience everything.
you get great things happen and terrible things happen, and it's how you deal with 'em at the end of the night.
it's like life.
a thousand miles and 32 hours can be a lifetime in a blink.
do they find glory?
I couldn 't say. Because the race never ends.
but if they do. It's in the dust. And it won 't wash away.
what it is, it's like a flying couch. You know?
that is probably the best way to explain it.
it's like sitting in your living room.
Yeah, it is a living room and a flying couch and just stay out of the big ditches.
my buddy, here's my buddy Steve Matzinger.
Yeah, baby. Oh, yeah. Baja!
he really wants to make the cut. - I wanna be in the movie!
he's not gonna be on the movie. - I wanna be in the big pictures.
Baja!
and as soon as we turned off the little light on the generator, we saw the... thought the floor was moving.
we turned it on, and it was solid cockroaches.
I was, like, "Oh, my God."
so I ran out to my pack and got a gallon of gas and ran a moat around my pack.
and me and Bob, we had to sleep in the same bed.
I said, "We're probably gonna get asphyxiated, but at least we're not gonna get eaten."
and in the morning there was a bunch of melted cockroaches.
I'm Don. I'm one of the sound mixers.
right now we're making up cables, custom cables for each camera.
we've got one of Don's... What kind of mike is that?
active... a 48-volt mike, which is a supercardioid pattern.
check, check, check. Check, check, check one, two.
check on this side, right, check on left side.
check. Check.
when those motorcycles turn on, it's loud. Loud!
we're yelling right now because we've got a bunch of loud motorcycles back here.
so we're just checking the levels, and see how they're doing.
how's that?
these cameras have a lot of switches that need to be in the right places, we discovered.
right.
what would Scorsese do? Talk real fast. We know that.
you know, Joe Pesci, he hit all these guys in the head with a shovel.
not bad.
not bad. But where we gonna get Joe Pesci, let alone a shovel?
editor... Dana Brown.
he's trying to cover up Matzinger, which I got it.
I still got... I can still make out Matzinger.
do you mind?
with the constant... the constant paparazzi trip.
like a candid camera.
you know what you do? You can fix your hair in this thing.
Hey, there's a camera behind that big piece of glass.
Dana's crazy. This is the biggest, craziest movie ever made.
ever.
sorry man, I'm just going, "Whoa, I'm gonna knock that guy on his butt."
saw
Yeah, well, you only missed him by about 12 inches.
yeah?
what were you shooting, Herr producer?
we were shooting a little place called Valle de Trinidad.
see all that spit fly like that? - Yeah. Yeah.
that's the effect that I have.
who said there wasn't special effects on this movie?
Yeah, is that...
is that you speaking Spanish, spitting all over?
that is. It's...
this is the first time we're going off-roading.
so, driver... - We're attempting the off-road race.
here we go. Off-road.
and we're off! - Here we go, Matzinger in the front.
good! - Matzinger! Matzinger!
here we go!
safe at last.
I think we're definitely trophy truck material now.
how fastidious you've become, Wormtail.
as I recall, you once called the nearest gutter pipe home.
could it be that the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you?
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.
I only meant...
...perhaps if we were to do it without the boy.
No! The boy is everything!
it cannot be done without him. And it will be done.
exactly as I said.
I will not disappoint you, my Lord. -Good.
first, gather our old comrades.
send them a sign.
Nagini tells me the old Muggle caretaker...
...is standing just outside the door.
step aside, Wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
Avada Kedavra!
Harry.
Harry!
are you all right?
Hermione. Bad dream.
when did you get here? -Just now. You?
last night.
wake up! Wake up, Ronald!
bloody hell.
honestly, get dressed.
and don't go back to sleep.
come on, Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready!
Ron, where are we actually going? -Don't know.
Hey, Dad. Where are we going? -Haven't the foggiest.
keep up!
Arthur!
it's about time, son.
sorry, Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start.
this is Amos Diggory, everyone. Works with me at the Ministry.
and this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right?
Yes, sir.
this way.
Merlin's beard! You must be Harry Potter.
Yes, sir. -Great, great pleasure.
pleasure to meet you too, sir.
Yes, it's just over there.
shall we? -Oh, yeah.
we don't want to be late.
come on. Nearly there now. Get yourself into a good position.
why are they all standing around that manky old boot?
that isn't just any manky old boot. -It's a Portkey.
time to go!
what's a Portkey?
ready! After three. One, two... -Harry!
...three!
let go, kids!
What?! -Let go!
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?
total shambles, as per usual. -Thanks.
go on, look at that!
well, kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!
stay together! Keep up, girls!
look!
come on! Keep up, girls!
blimey!
parting of the ways, I think, old chap.
see you at the match. -See you.
Cedric. -Ced, come on.
see you later, Cedric.
home sweet home.
what?
excellent, excellent. -Ginny, look!
all to the bath. -Look.
girls, choose a bunk and unpack.
Ron, get out of the kitchen. We're all hungry.
Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron! -Feet off the table!
feet off the table! -Feet off the table!
I love magic.
get your Quidditch World Cup programs here!
blimey, Dad. How far up are we?
well, put it this way:
if it rains...
...you'll be the first to know.
father and I are in the minister's box...
...By personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself.
don't boast, Draco.
there's no need with these people.
do enjoy yourself, won't you?
while you can.
come on up. Take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for.
come on!
it's the lrish! There's Troy!
and Mullet! -And Moran!
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!
here come the Bulgarians! -Yes!
who's that?
that, sis, is the best Seeker in the world.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
Krum!
Yes!
good evening!
as Minister for Magic...
...it gives me great pleasure...
...to welcome each and every one of you...
...to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!
let the match...
...begin!
Krum! Krum! Krum!
there's no one like Krum.
Krum? -Dumb Krum?
he's like a bird, the way he rides the wind.
he's more than an athlete. -Dumb Krum.
he's an artist.
I think you're in love, Ron. -Shut up.
Viktor, I love you
Viktor, I do
when we're apart My heart beats only for you
sounds like the lrish have got their pride on.
stop! Stop it!
it's not the lrish.
we've gotta get out of here. Now!
get out, it's the Death Eaters!
get back to the Portkey, everybody, and stick together!
Fred, George! Ginny is your responsibility.
go!
Harry!
keep up, you lot! -Harry!
Harry! Harry!
Morsmordre!
Harry!
where are you? -Harry!
we've been looking for you for ages!
thought we lost you, mate.
what is that?
Stupefy!
stop!
that's my son!
Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right? -We came back for Harry.
which of you conjured it?
crouch, you can't possible-- -Do not lie!
you've been discovered at the scene of the crime.
crime? -Barty! They're just kids.
what crime?
it's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark.
what, Voldemort?
those people tonight, in the masks, they're his too, aren't they?
his followers? -Yeah.
death Eaters.
follow me. -There was a man, before.
there!
all of you, this way!
a man, Harry?
who?
I don't know.
I didn't see his face.
anything from the trolley?
anything from the trolley?
anything from the trolley, dears?
packet of Drooble's...
...and a Licorice Wand.
on second thought, just the Drooble's.
it's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry. -Just the Drooble's. Thanks.
two Pumpkin Pasties, please.
thank you.
anything sweet for you, dear?
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.
anything from the trolley?
this is horrible.
how can the Ministry not know who conjured it?
wasn't there any security or...?
loads, according to Dad.
that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses.
it's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar.
I'm fine.
you know Sirius will want to hear about this...
...what you saw at the World Cup and the dream.
Hedwig. There we go.
clear the runway!
well, there's something you don't see every day.
well, now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement.
this castle will not only be your home this year...
...but home to some very special guests as well.
you see, Hogwarts has been chosen...
Yes, what is it?
what is it?
tell them to wait. Tell them to wait. Wait.
so Hogwarts has been chosen to host a legendary event:
the Triwizard Tournament.
for those of you who do not know... -Brilliant.
...the Triwizard Tournament brings together three schools...
...for a series of magical contests.
from each school, a single student is selected to compete.
now let me be clear.
if chosen, you stand alone.
and trust me when I say...
...these contests are not for the faint-hearted.
but more of that later. For now, please join me in welcoming...
...the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...
...and their headmistress, Madame Maxime.
bloody hell.
blimey. That's one big woman.
and now our friends from the north.
please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang...
...and their high master, lgor Karkaroff.
Oh, it's Krum!
blimey, it's him!
Viktor Krum!
Albus.
Igor.
professor Dumbly-dorr, my horses have traveled a long way.
they will need attending to. -Don't worry, Madame Maxime.
our gamekeeper, Hagrid, is more than capable of seeing to them.
but you know, Monsieur Hagrid...
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.
you idiot!
your attention, please!
I'd like to say a few words.
eternal glory.
that is what awaits the student who wins the Triwizard Tournament.
but to do this, that student must survive three tasks.
three extremely dangerous tasks.
wicked. -Wicked.
for this reason, the Ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule.
to explain all this...
...we have the head of the Department of lnternational Magical Cooperation...
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.
bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.
Alastor Moody? The Auror? -Auror?
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.
he's supposed to be mad as a hatter, though, these days.
my dear old friend, thanks for coming. -Stupid ceiling.
thank you.
what's that he's drinking, do you suppose?
I don't know, but I don't think it's pumpkin juice.
after due consideration...
...the Ministry has concluded that, for their own safety...
...no student under the age of 1 7...
...shall be allowed to put forth their name for the Triwizard Tournament.
this decision is final. -That's rubbish!
that's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!
Silence! -They're not too happy about that, then.
the Goblet of Fire.
anyone wishing to submit themselves to the tournament...
...need only write their name upon a piece of parchment...
...and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night.
do not do so lightly.
if chosen, there's no turning back.
as from this moment, the Triwizard Tournament has begun.
Alastor Moody.
Ex-Auror...
...Ministry malcontent...
...and your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
I am here because Dumbledore asked me. End of story, goodbye, the end.
any questions?
when it comes to the Dark Arts...
...I believe in a practical approach.
but first, which of you can tell me how many Unforgivable Curses there are?
three, sir. -And they are so named?
because they are unforgivable. The use of any one of them will
will earn you a one-way ticket to Azkaban, correct.
the Ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do.
I say different! You need to know what you're up against!
you need to be prepared.
you need to find another place to put your chewing gum...
...besides the underside of your desk, Mr. Finnigan!
no way. The old codger can see out the back of his head.
and hear across classrooms!
so which curse shall we see first?
Weasley! -Yes?
stand.
give us a curse.
well, my dad did tell me about one.
the lmperius Curse.
Oh, yeah, your father would know all about that.
gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago.
perhaps this will show you why.
hello.
lovely little beauty.
Engorgio.
Imperio!
don't worry. It's completely harmless.
if she bites...
...She's lethal.
what are you laughing at?
get off!
talented, isn't she?
what should I have her do next? Jump out the window?
drown herself?
scores of witches and wizards have claimed...
...that they only did You-Know-Who's bidding...
...under the influence of the lmperius Curse.
but here's the rub:
how do we sort out the liars?
another, another.
up, up. Come on.
Longbottom, is it?
up.
professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology.
there's the...
the Cruciatus Curse.
correct, correct. Come, come.
particularly nasty.
the torture curse.
Crucio!
stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him? Stop it!
perhaps you could give us the last Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.
no?
Avada Kedavra!
the Killing Curse.
only one person is known to have survived it...
...and he's sitting in this room.
brilliant, isn't he?
completely demented, of course, and terrifying to be in the same room with...
...but he's really been there, you know? He's looked evil in the eye.
there's a reason those curses are unforgivable.
to perform them in a classroom... I mean, did you see Neville's face?
Neville?
son?
you all right?
come on. We'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something.
we're gonna be late!
come on, Cedric. Put it in!
eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?
three years from now, when we're old enough to be chosen.
Yeah, rather you than me.
Yes!
thank you, thank you.
well, lads, we've done it. -Cooked it up just this morning.
it's not going to work.
Oh, yeah? -And why is that, Granger?
you see this? This is an Age Line.
Dumbledore drew it himself.
so?
so a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled...
...By a dodge as pathetically dimwitted as an Aging Potion.
but that's why it's so brilliant. -Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.
ready, Fred? -Ready, George.
bottoms up. -Bottoms up.
Yes! -Yes!
Yeah!
Yes!
ready?
Yes! -Yes!
you said! -You said!
Oh, right, you want a piece of me?! -I'll tear your ears off!
now you're making me laugh. -Take this! Come on!
fight! Fight! Fight!
sit down. Please.
now the moment you've all been waiting for:
the champion selection.
the Durmstrang champion is Viktor Krum.
the champion for Beauxbatons...
...is Fleur Delacour.
the Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!
Excellent! We now have our three champions.
but in the end, only one will go down in history.
only one will hoist this chalice of champions...
...this vessel of victory...
...the Triwizard Cup!
Harry Potter.
Harry Potter?
no. No.
Harry Potter!
go on, Harry.
Harry, for goodness sake.
he's a cheat!
he's not even 1 7 yet!
it's wrong, I tell you! -You French tart.
everything is a conspiracy theory with you! -Quiet! I can't think!
everything is a conspiracy theory! -I protest.
Harry. -I protest!
did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?
no, sir. -Did you ask one of the older students...
...to do it for you? -No, sir.
you're absolutely sure? -Yes. Yes, sir.
but of course he is lying. -The hell he is!
the Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object.
only an exceptionally powerful Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it.
magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year.
you seem to have given this a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.
it was once my job to think as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...
...perhaps you remember. -This doesn't help, Alastor.
leave this to you, Barty.
the rules are absolute.
the Goblet of Fire constitutes a binding magical contract.
Mr. Potter has no choice.
he is, as of tonight...
...a Triwizard champion.
this can't go on, Albus.
first the Dark Mark. Now this?
what do you suggest, Minerva?
put an end to it.
don't let Potter compete.
you heard Barty. The rules are clear.
well, the devil with Barty and his rules.
and since when did you accommodate the Ministry?
headmaster, l, too, find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence.
however, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events...
...perhaps we should, for the time being...
...Iet them unfold.
what--? Do nothing?
offer him up as bait?
potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.
I agree. With Severus.
alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?
I can do that. -Don't let him know, though.
he must be anxious enough as it is...
...knowing what lies ahead.
then again, we all are.
how did you do it?
never mind. Doesn't matter. Might've let your best friend know, though.
let you know what? -You know bloody well what.
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.
okay?
you're being stupid. -Yeah, that's me.
Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's stupid friend.
I didn't put my name in that cup.
I don't want eternal glory. I just wanna be...
look, I don't know what happened tonight, and I don't know why.
it just did.
okay?
piss off.
what a charismatic quartet.
hello.
I'm Rita Skeeter.
I write for the Daily Prophet.
but of course you know that, don't you? It's you we don't know.
you're the juicy news.
what quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks?
what mysteries do the muscles mask?
does courage lie beneath those curls?
in short, what makes a champion tick?
me, Myself & l want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers.
so who's feeling up to sharing?
shall we start with the youngest? Lovely.
this is cozy.
it's a broom cupboard.
you should feel right at home, then.
don't mind if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?
no.
so tell me, Harry.
here you sit, a mere boy of 12
I'm 14. Sorry.
about to compete against three students...
...not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself...
...but who have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt...
...in your dizziest daydreams.
concerned?
I don't know. I haven't really thought about it.
just ignore the quill.
then, of course, you're no ordinary boy of 1 2, are you?
fourteen. -Your story's legend.
do you think it was the trauma of your past...
...that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament?
no, I didn't enter.
of course you didn't.
everyone loves a rebel, Harry.
scratch that last.
speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel?
proud? Or concerned...
...that your attitude shows, at best, a pathological need for attention...
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?
Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past.
Harry, I couldn 't risk sending Hedwig.
since the World Cup, the Ministry's been intercepting more and more owls...
...and she 's too easily recognized.
we need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.
meet me in the Gryffindor common room, 1: 00 this Saturday night.
and make sure you 're alone.
Sirius.
P. S.
the bird bites.
Sirius?
Harry Potter, age 12...
...suspect entrant in the Triwizard Tournament.
his eyes swimming with the ghosts of his past...
...and choking back tears...
Sirius. How--?
I don ' t have much time, so let me get straight to it.
did you or did you not put your name into the Goblet of Fire?
No!
I had to ask.
now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.
but who was the third man in the room?
I don't know. -You didn't hear a name?
no.
Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.
and what was that?
he wanted...
...me.
I don't know why. But he was gonna use this man to get to me.
but, I mean, it was only a dream, right?
Yes.
it's just a dream.
look, Harry.
the Death Eaters at the World Cup, your name rising from that goblet...
...these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.
what are you saying?
I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff?
he was a Death Eater. And no one, no one stops being a Death Eater.
then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone. Sent his own son to Azkaban.
you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet...
...but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.
I'm not ready for this, Sirius. -You don't have a choice.
someone's coming. -Keep your friends close, Harry.
who were you talking to?
what? Who says I was talking to anyone? -I heard voices.
maybe you're imagining things. Wouldn't be the first time.
you're probably just practicing for your next interview, I expect.
amazing.
amazing! -Neville. You're doing it again.
right, sorry.
"magical Water Plants of the Highland Lochs"?
moody gave it to me. That day we had tea.
it's already been through enough people.
why don't you just go and talk to him yourself?
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.
what do you want me to say again?
go.
ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him...
...that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid's looking for you.
is that right? Well, you
what?
are you sure you won't do this? -Do it.
Dean was told by Parvati that...
please don't ask me to say it again.
Hagrid's looking for you.
well, you can tell Ronald-- -I'm not an owl!
did you bring your father's cloak, like I asked you?
Yeah, I brought the cloak. Hagrid, where are we going?
you'll see soon enough.
now pay attention, this is important.
what's with the flower?
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?
as a matter of fact, I have.
you might like to try the same thing now and again.
Hagrid?
the cloak! Put the cloak on!
bonsoir, Olympe. -Oh, Hagrid.
I thought perhaps you weren't coming. I thought perhaps...
...you had forgotten me.
couldn't forget you, Olympe.
what is it you wanted to show me?
when we spoke earlier, you sounded so...
...exhilarated.
you'll be glad you came. Trust me.
can we get closer?
dragons?
that's the first task?
you're joking. -Come on, Harry.
these are seriously misunderstood creatures.
Oh, crikey!
although, I have to admit, that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work.
poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him, you know.
Ron was here? -Oh, sure.
his brother Charlie helped to bring him over from Romania.
didn't Ron tell you that?
no, he didn't.
he didn't tell me a thing.
you cheat, Potter. -You stink, Potter.
good luck, Potter. -Potter stinks!
Cedric rules. -Thanks.
like the badge?
excuse me.
Harry.
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!
can I have a word?
all right. -You stink, Potter!
Potter, you stink! -Harry Potter smells!
dragons. That's the first task.
they've got one for each of us. -Come on, Ced!
are you serious?
and Fleur and Krum, do they--?
Yes. -Come on, Ced, leave him.
right. -He's not worth it.
read the badges, Potter! -Hey, listen. About the badges.
I've asked them not to wear them, but-- -Don't worry about it.
it's not like I try to blow things up, exactly.
it just happens a fair bit.
you have to admit, though, fire's pretty fascinating.
you're a right foul git, you know that?
you think so? -I know so.
anything else?
Yeah. Stay away from me. -Fine.
there's Potter. Cheat. -Why so tense, Potter?
my father and I have a bet, you see.
I don't think you're gonna last 10 minutes in this tournament.
he disagrees. He thinks you won't last five.
I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy.
he's vile and cruel. And you're just pathetic.
pathetic? -Oh, no, you don't, sonny!
I'll teach you to curse someone when their back is turned!
you stinking, cowardly, scummy...
professor Moody! -...back-shooting
what are you doing? -Teaching.
ls that a--? Is that a student? -Technically, it's a ferret.
stand still! Stand still!
my father will hear about this! -ls that a threat?
professor Moody! -ls that a threat?
professor!
I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair!
Alastor! Alastor. -lt doesn't end here!
we never use transfiguration as a punishment!
surely Dumbledore told you that.
he might've mentioned it. -Well, you will do well to remember it.
away!
you. Come with me.
that's a Foe-Glass.
lets me keep an eye on my enemies.
if I can see the whites of their eyes, they're standing right behind me.
wouldn't even bother telling you what's in there.
you wouldn't believe it if I did.
now...
...what are you going to do about your dragon?
well, you know, I just thought l'd...
sit.
listen to me, Potter.
your pal Diggory?
by your age, he could turn a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time.
miss Delacour?
she's as much a fairy princess as I am.
as for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust...
...but Karkaroff's is not.
they'll have a strategy.
and you can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths.
come on, Potter.
what are your strengths?
I don't know.
well, I can fly. I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But l...
better than fair, the way I heard it. -But I'm not allowed a broom.
you're allowed a wand.
bets! Place your bets!
bets taken! Bets taken here!
step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter in today's bloodbath?
smart money's on Krum to survive! Any bets?
Yes, sir?
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go. Thank you very much.
your attention, please.
this is a great day for all of us.
each of the three tasks involves very considerable danger.
please keep your seats at all times.
this will minimize any risks you may be exposed to.
Harry? Is that you? -Yeah.
I'm sure we all wish our champions...
how are you feeling? Okay? -... the greatest of luck.
the key is to concentrate. After that, you just have to
battle a dragon.
young love.
how...
...stirring.
if everything goes unfortunately today...
...you two may even make the front page.
you have no business here.
this tent is for champions...
...and friends.
no matter. We've got what we wanted.
good day, champions. Gather round, please.
now, you've waited, you've wondered, and at last the moment has arrived.
a moment only four of you can fully appreciate.
what are you doing here, Miss Granger?
sorry, I'll just go.
barty, the bag.
champions, in a circle around me.
miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.
and, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here. That's right. Now...
...Miss Delacour, if you will.
the Welsh Green.
Mr. Krum.
the Chinese Fireball.
the Swedish Short-Snout.
which leaves... -The Horntail.
what's that, boy? -Nothing.
the Hungarian Horntail.
these represent four very real dragons...
...each of which has been given a golden egg to protect.
your objective is simple:
collect the egg.
this you must do, for each egg contains a clue...
...without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task.
any questions?
very well. Good luck, champions.
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon, you may
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!
three of our champions have now faced their dragons...
...and so each one of them will proceed to the next task.
and now our fourth and final contestant.
Harry! Harry! Harry!
your wand, Harry! Your wand!
Accio Firebolt!
Yeah! -Yes!
Oh, my God.
Yeah! -Yeah! Well done, dragon!
Yes! Yes!
Yes, Harry! -Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.
or an arm. -Pack it in altogether?
Never! -Never!
shush!
go on, Harry. What's the clue?
who wants me to open it? -Yes!
do you want me to open it? -Yes!
what the bloody hell was that?
all right, everyone! Go back to your knitting.
this is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosy sods listening in.
I reckon you have to be barking mad to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.
caught on, have you? Took you long enough.
I wasn't the only one who thought you'd done it.
everyone was saying it behind your back.
brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.
least I warned you about the dragons. -Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
no, no, no, I did.
no, don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you...
...that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.
Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along.
I thought we'd be all right, you know...
...after you'd figured that out.
who--? Who could possibly figure that out?
that's completely mental.
Yeah. Isn't it?
I suppose I was a bit distraught.
boys.
Hi, Harry. -Hi, Harry.
Cho, Harry's looking at you.
shush.
look at this!
I can't believe it! She's done it again.
miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl...
...seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards.
her latest prey, sources report...
...is none other than the Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.
no word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.
parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.
thank you, Nigel.
not now, Nigel. Later.
go on.
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.
mum sent me a dress.
well, it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?
nose down, Harry.
Ginny, these must be for you. -I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.
what are you on about?
they're not for Ginny.
they're for you.
dress robes. -Dress robes? For what?
the Yule Ball...
...has been a tradition of the Triwizard Tournament...
...since its inception.
on Christmas Eve night, we and our guests...
...gather in the Great Hall...
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.
as representatives of the host school...
...I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward.
and I mean this literally, because...
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...
...a dance.
Silence!
the house of Godric Gryffindor has commanded the respect...
...of the wizard world for nearly 1 0 centuries.
I will not have you, in the course of a single evening, besmirching that name...
...By behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.
try saying that five times fast, huh?
now, to dance...
...is to let the body breathe.
inside every girl, a secret swan slumbers...
...Ionging to burst forth and take flight.
something's about to burst out of Eloise Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.
inside every boy, a lordly lion prepared to prance.
Mr. Weasley. -Yes?
will you join me, please?
now, place your right hand on my waist.
where? -My waist.
and extend your arm.
Mr. Filch, if you please.
never gonna let him forget this, are you?
never. -Never.
everybody come together. Boys, on your feet!
why do they have to travel in packs?
how are you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?
blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons. If you can't get a date, who can?
I think I'd take the dragon right now.
I take after my mum.
though I didn't know her very well. She left when I was about 3.
no, not the maternal sort, her.
broke me dad's heart, though. He was a tiny little fella, my dad.
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with one hand and put him up on the dresser.
he laughed so hard at that.
very funny.
and then he died just when I started school, so...
so I sort of had to make me own way, as it were.
but enough of me. What about you?
this is mad. At this rate, we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
well, us and Neville.
Yeah, but, then again, he can take himself.
it might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
now I'm really depressed.
get a move on or all the good ones will have gone.
who you going with, then?
Oi, Angelina? -What?
do you wanna go to the ball with me?
to the ball?
Yeah, all right.
Oi, Hermione.
you're a girl.
very well spotted.
come with one of us?
come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone.
for a girl, it's just sad.
I won't be going alone, because, believe it or not, someone's asked me!
and I said yes!
bloody hell.
she's lying, right?
if you say so.
look, we've just gotta grit our teeth and do it.
tonight, when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?
agreed.
Cho! -Harry!
watch yourself on the stairs. It's a bit icy at the top.
okay, thanks.
Cho?
yes?
well, I just wondered if you
I wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
sorry, I didn't catch that.
I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
Harry...
...I'm sorry, but someone's already asked me.
and...
well, I've said I'll go with him.
okay. Yeah. Great.
fine. No problem.
okay. Good.
Harry?
I really am...
...sorry.
it's all right, Ron.
it's okay, Ron. It's all right. It doesn't matter.
what happened to you?
he just asked Fleur Delacour out.
what? -What did she say?
no, of course.
she said yes? -Don't be silly.
there she was, walking by. You know how I like it when she walks.
I couldn't help it. It just sort of slipped out.
actually, he sort of screamed at her. It was a bit frightening.
and what did you do then? -What else? I ran for it.
I'm not cut out for this, Harry. I don't know what got into me.
Hi, Harry. -Hi, Harry.
I always liked looking at them from behind.
she's never gonna forgive me, ever.
Hey!
bloody hell.
bloody hell.
bloody...
Oh, bloody...
what are those? What are those?
my dress robes. -Well, they're all right!
no lace. No dodgy little collar.
well, I expect yours are more traditional.
Traditional?! They're ancient! I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.
murder me, Harry.
leave it alone!
poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room, crying her eyes out.
who? -Hermione, of course.
come on, Harry, why do you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?
because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
nobody asked her. Would've taken her myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.
Hello, boys. -Hello, boys.
don't you look...
...dashing.
there you are, Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
ready, professor? -To dance.
it's traditional that the three champions-- Well, in this case, four.
are the first to dance.
surely I told you that. -No.
well, now you know.
as for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.
Oh, there you are. -Come on, then.
come along this way.
Oh, come on.
Hi. -Now, I need you all to line up...
...in the procession, please. Oh, you are very late.
this way. This way. Come along.
she looks beautiful!
Yeah, she does.
guardian of the universe protecting us against the forces of evil.
he can catch a bullet. Halt a speeding train.
and leap tall buildings in a single bound.
up in the sky! - Is it a bird? Is it a plane?
a mailman by day. The city's guardian by night.
defending the citizens of New York from the forces of evil.
the world has been protected by a group of extraordinary men and women...
... who have dedicated themselves to fighting crime.
mysterious traveller from another dimension.
he has powers far beyond the capabilities of mere Earthlings.
I always wondered why nobody did it before me.
I mean, all those comic books, movies, TVshows.
you'd think that one eccentric loner would have made himself a costume.
I mean, is everyday life really so exciting?
are schools and offices so thrilling...
... that I'm the only one who ever fantasized about this?
come on, be honest with yourself.
at some point in our lives we all wanted to be a superhero.
that's not me, by the way.
that's some Armenian guy with a history of mental health problems.
who am I?
I'm Kick-Ass.
that's me... back before any of this crazy shit happened.
I guess I was the last person you'd expect to become a superhero.
I'm not saying there was anything wrong with me...
... but there's nothing special, either.
asshole! - I wasn't into sports.
I wasn't a mathlete or a hard core gamer.
I didn't have a piercing or an eating disorder or 3, 000 friends on MySpace.
my only superpower was being invisible to girls.
and out of my friends, man, I wasn't even the funny one.
like most people my age, I just existed.
good morning, class.
please open your books to Act Two, Scene Two.
kick in my bedroom door and you'll probably find me watching TV...
... or talking to my friend Todd on Skype.
you watching 'Family Guy'? - No.
me neither. Turn on nippleslip. Com. It's good.
or jerking off, mostly to my English teacher.
Dave Lizewski. Don't think I haven't noticed you looking at my tits.
Oh, I want your hands all over me, Dave. Please.
sure, a lot of what got me through the average school day...
... was making deposits in the whackoff warehouse for later.
though, to be honest, it didn't take much to set me off.
I swear, when my hormones balance out...
... shares in Kleenex are gonna take a dive, man.
Dave Lizewski. Shouldn't you be looking at 'Hamlet' right now?
Yes, Mrs Zane.
sorry.
but don't get me wrong. I like girls my own age, too.
especially Katie Deauxma. - Hey, gorgeous.
Hey.
Oh... no.
you meant Erika.
I know. I knew that. I was just kidding.
okay, cool.
Oh my God.
Hey, look, I'm Todd's mom.
that's funny. This is your dad.
no, that's still my mom, actually.
Oh, the fuck!
I was just a regular guy.
no radioactive spiders, no refugee status from a doomed alien world.
you know what? Todd said they do still make Count Chocula.
they just don't sell it at the store any more.
my mother was killed by an aneurism in the kitchen.
as opposed to a gunman in the alley.
so if you were hoping for any...
I will avenge you, mother!
... you're out of luck.
in the 18 months since my mother died...
... the only epiphany I had was realising that life just goes on.
did they change the bee's face?
no.
how come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?
boy, I dunno. Probably because it's fucking impossible, dipshit.
what, putting on a mask and helping people, how's that impossible?
that's not superhero, though.
super's like being strongerthan everybody and flying and shit. That's just hero.
no, it's not even hero. It's just fucking psycho.
Hello? Bruce Wayne? He didn't have any powers.
Yes, but he had all the expensive shit that doesn't exist.
I thought you meant how come nobody does it in real life?
Yeah, Todd, that's what I meant.
dude, if anybody did it in real life they'd get their ass kicked.
they'd be dead in, like, a day. - A day.
Yeah, okay, I'm not saying they should do it.
ljust can't figure out why nobody does.
seriously, out of all the millions of people who love superheroes, you'd think one would give it a try.
Jesus, guys, does it not bug you?
why thousands of people wanna be Paris Hilton and nobody wants to be Spiderman?
Yeah, what's with that? She has, like, no tits at all.
maybe it's a porn tape. He doesn't have a porn tape.
you guys never saw 'One Night In Spiderman'?
Oooh, guess who?
is it me or do you kinda feel sorry for Chris D'Amico?
must be terrible to have a rich dad and everything you want.
I wish you wouldn't have said anything cos I feel like I'm gonna start crying...
the fact that he's always on his own.
we should, like, talk to him.
see if he wants to hang out with us.
Oh, I didn't say we should talk to him, ljust...
think about it. Come on, it'd be awesome.
if he was ourfriend, noone would everfuck with us again.
go on then, Todd.
you wanna go talk to him? - No, no, no. No.
no, you wanna go talk to him? I can move.
Dave, Dave should go. - Dave should go.
Why? - Dave, you should totally go.
you're a dick. - Don't be afraid, Dave.
you're a pussy.
fuck off!
did you spray anything overthere? - I think I might have shat my pants.
if that guy spoke to me like that I would have kicked his ass.
Todd, when have you ever kicked anyone's ass?
whatever, man. I would have just gone for his knees.
well, you're not making sense.
well, what I'm saying is the superior force of Batman's Batarang would undoubtedly penetrate the Joker's force field, leaving him totally vulnerable to the...
all right, and then... but, you know... - Whoa, whoa, whoa Pussy patrol.
phones. Money.
dude, not again, come on.
phone.
I don't have one Someone else jacked it last week.
pussy. - Give me the bag.
it's just comics. - Yo, you wanna get cut?
look at this asshole just watching.
come on, be honest with yourself.
would you do anything differently?
we see someone in trouble and we wish we could help, but we don't.
the world I lived in... heroes only existed in comic books.
I guess that would have been okay if bad guys were make-believe, too.
but they're not.
Frankie, I'm telling you, man, I swear I'm not making this up.
this fucking guy comes out of nowhere.
kicks our asses and steals all the coke.
the guy that looks like Batman? - I didn't say he looked like Batman.
you did Tre, you said the guy looked like Batman.
he said like a mask and stuff. - And a cape.
Yeah, like Batman.
I didn't say "like Batman." I never said "Batman."
okay.
let me tell you the problem I got with that, Tre.
our mole with the Russians tells things a little different.
according to him, you sold him my coke and you took the money.
that's a fucking lie!
I can't believe that you would believe this shit from a fucking Russian, man!
let me see, Tre, what's more likely, huh?
that you're a greedy little cock-sucker or all my coke was stolen by Superman?
Batman. - I never said Batman!
enough!
my son is waiting to go to the movies and I ain't gonna disappoint him.
Joe, you're in charge.
that's gotta be the worst fucking excuse I ever heard, Tre.
sorry you had to wait, buddy. - The movie is starting in 10 minutes.
it's okay, we're cool.
we're only gonna miss the trailers. - Yeah, but I wanna get some popcorn.
when we get in there, get Chris some popcorn. Okay?
what d'you wanna drink?
you want a Pepsi? - Yeah, that's fine.
get him a Pepsi and I'll have an Icee. Mixed.
like when they mix the red one and the blue one.
and a pack of Twizzlers.
the comic books had it wrong.
it didn't take a trauma or cosmic rays or a power ring to make a superhero.
just the perfect combination of optimism and naivety.
you are fucking awesome.
come on then, bring it on!
daddy, I'm scared. - Come on, Mindy. Honey.
be a big girl now. There's nothing to be afraid of.
is it gonna hurt bad? - Oh, child.
only for a second, sugar.
a handgun bullet travels at more than...
700 miles an hour. - 700 miles an hour.
so at close range, like this, the force is gonna take you off yourfeet for sure...
...but it's really no more painful than a punch in the chest.
I hate getting punched in the chest.
you're gonna be fine, baby doll.
how was that? Not so bad.
kinda fun, huh? Now you know how it feels.
you won't be scared when some junkie asshole pulls a Glock.
I wouldn't have been scared anyways. - That's my girl.
all right, up you get. Come on.
two more rounds and then home.
again? - Uh-huh.
only if we can go by the bowling alley on the way back.
the bowling alley? - Yeah. And ice-cream after.
okay. Two more rounds. No wincing...
...no whining, and you got yourself a deal, young lady.
Yeah! I'm gonna get a hot fudge sundae.
good call, baby doll.
so, have you thought about what you might want for your birthday?
can I get a puppy?
you wanna get a dog? - Yeah, a cuddly fluffy one.
and a Bratz Moviestar Makeover Sasha.
I'm just fucking with you, Daddy.
look, I'll have a Benchmade model-42 butterfly knife.
Oh, child. You always knock me for a loop.
you know what? - What?
I'm gonna get you two. - Two?
one Balisong. Two Balisong. That's what you get.
the glass of fashion and the mould of form.
the observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
and I, of ladies most deject and wretched...
I'll be honest, there wasn't a whole lot of crime-fighting in those first few weeks.
but even so, my new vocation kept me plenty busy.
shit.
I called it preparation.
but if you called it fantasizing, it would have been hard to argue.
all I knew was I'd never felt so good about myself.
fuck!
okay, maybe I was still in the beta testing phase.
but it was a start.
what the fuck are you looking at?
nothing. - Get the fuck out of here!
like every serial killer already knew, eventually fantasizing just doesn't do it for you any more.
it was time to engage.
hurry up, man.
what the fuck?
the fuck you looking at?
I said what the fuck are you looking at?
two cheap shit losers screwing with a car...
...that someone probably worked their ass off to pay for.
say what? - Leave it be, man.
this motherfucker's obviously high.
I'm not high. Ljust think it sucks you guys think you can do what you want.
just walk away from the car and we can forget about this.
you're crazy, man.
fuck this shit.
shit. - Let's get out of here.
I came round long enough to beg the medic not to tell anybody about the costume.
he promised he wouldn't.
all I knew was my dad was gonna kill me.
why can't I have a gun? I'm a security guard.
you're a doorman now. You don't get a gun no more.
I look like a putz.
you look sharp. All them buttons. Do your job, open the fucking door.
have a nice day.
good morning, Frank. - Hey, Joe, how you doing?
great.
want some coffee? - Maybe later.
morning, Ange. - Morning.
Chris. - Morning, Joe.
Frank, we got a thing.
it's a big thing, Frank.
okay.
sorry, hon. - Do what you gotta do.
Chris, where do you think you're going? - I gotta talk to dad.
Christopher.
Frank, honey.
where do you think you're going?
I don't mind you talking business. I was just gonna sit quietly.
I should probably start learning this stuff anyway.
Hey, go finish your oatmeal.
God-dammit, I'm gonna be 18 in 8 months, for Christ sakes.
take a seat.
so what's the problem?
our Russian says that Tre just sold him another 5 K's at half price.
which Tre? Tre Tre? - Right. Dead Tre.
so now I'm getting fucked in the ass by a ghost?
or Tre was telling the truth.
what, this is my choice? I gotta believe in ghosts or superheroes?
not the part about the superhero, Frankie.
just that he might have really been gaffled by somebody.
I think we better invite our Russian overfor a friendly chat.
see what's really going on.
Hey, early birdie. You beat me to it.
I wanted to get you breakfast this morning.
happy birthday, sweetheart.
check this out.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Oh my gosh! Dad.
Wow. Watch, Dad.
okay, pop quiz. What's the proper name for one of those?
easy: Balisong. It's Filipino. Ask me another.
excellent, good.
the AR15 was a lighter...
...smaller calibre version of what design?
Eugene Stoner's AR10. Now give me a hard one.
the name of...
...John Woo's first full-length feature?
tie Han Rou Qing'. 'The Young Dragons'.
daddy, look.
Hey, come on, you're not looking.
the point is some fucker is killing our guys.
and until we find out who that is,
I don't wanna see any of you bitches sitting around on your asses, all right?!
what the fuck d'you...
hello.
Hey, Joe, yeah.
no, he's just training right now. One second.
dad. Phone.
dad, the phone's for you.
who is it? - It's Joe.
what's the problem?
Yeah, Frank...
turns out we ain't got the vice here no more.
Really? - Uh-uh.
but we do got a brand new industrial microwave -they use it for treating the lumber.
well, that is neat.
I think you must be confusing me with someone who gives a shit about the fucking lumber!
Yeah, o-okay. All right, Frank. - Now quit bugging me and - All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? I... - get the fucking rest of the information.
all right, okay.
right, come on, go ahead.
Hey, look, the guys tell me he's Tre Fernandez.
what do I know, huh?
shut up. - Now you say Fernandez is dead.
okay, he lie. - Get inside. Shut up.
he lie about... - Fucking mamaluke...
this work like a regular microwave?
fuck do I know? We're not making a Hungry Man dinner. Just turn it on.
here we go.
okay, I wanna know who sold you our coke.
and don't tell me somebody who's dead this time.
can he hear you? I don't think he can hearyou.
I said who really sold you our coke?
who sold...
...you... our... coke?
Oh, shit! Shit!
this is awesome!
I look like fricking Wolverine.
you still have that metal detector at your school?
Yeah. It's gonna have a meltdown.
Dave, I need to ask you something.
okay.
the police report. They found you naked.
you said you didn't remember why.
the muggers, they didn't...
what?
no. Jesus. No, I... I wasn't even...
in the ambulance they threw my clothes away because of the blood.
okay, okay.
seemed like no time at all before I was back on my feet.
Dave's what? - Keep it down.
apart from some messed-up nerve endings, the doctors fixed me up pretty good.
did you feel that? - No.
you're like fucking Jason Bourne or something, man. That owns.
how about that? - No, Marty.
give it a fucking rest.
I've only been back like half a day and
he's right. I'm sorry. I'm acting totally childish.
stop with the fork. - Watch this.
Hey.
Dave, hey.
Oh, hey.
how are you? You look better.
I'm good. Yeah, much better.
you're into comic books, aren't you?
well, me and Erika sometimes hang out after school at this really great store -Atomic Comics.
they make the best white chocolate milk-a-latte.
yeah?
I could buy you one sometime if you need someone to talk to.
sure. Thank you. - Okay.
sweet. Well, I'll see you later.
did you see that? - Yeah?
Katie Deauxma just offered to buy me coffee.
Yeah. You know, I really don't think that's what it looks like.
what are you talking about? - The point is...
...Katie's all about the lame ducks.
what's this got to do with me?
I've been trying to figure out how to tell you this.
there's a rumour going around... - Right.
...that you... - What?
...are gay. - Gay?!
what kind of rumour's that? - Well, getting mugged and...
you guys have been mugged. - I know, but...
...we didn't get beat up and have all our clothes taken off.
it's not even true. The medic threw my clothes away.
don't worry about it. Rumours don't mean shit.
we know the truth.
right?
Yeah. - Yeah.
who knows, this might even get you laid.
no, not if she thinks he's gay, Todd. You fucking retard.
that's really fucking helping me! - I'm just being honest.
I was getting back to my old self.
I should have quit, of course...
... but you can't just re-programme yourself...
... what you want, who you are, your purpose in life.
no, I'm just standing around.
no, I'm not!
it is what it is. - How about that, huh?
Oh, yeah. Didn't see that, did you?
think it's best that you just walk away.
well maybe you shouldn't do that.
what? Huh?
are you looking at me?
well, this is my business.
me? My hardware was fixed now.
I was back and running Kick-Ass version 2. 0.
excuse me. Have you seen this cat?
no? Okay, thank you.
excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this cat?
I'm sorry, did you see this cat?
no? Okay.
Oh, great!
here, kitty. Here, Mr Bitey.
come on. No, no, no, no, no.
no, no, no. Mr Bitey, come on.
back here. Come on, let's get you home. Come on.
fuck you, Mr Bitey!
Oh, God, I'm so sorry, man.
you fucking...
Thanks, freak.
leave him alone. - Fuck off, it's none of your business.
yes it is.
Hey, call 911!
Hey, there's a dude dressed like a superhero fighting a bunch of guys.
it's fucking awesome!
leave him alone!
give it up, man. Just walk away.
no, never.
what the fuck is wrong with you? You'd rather die for some piece of shit...
...that you don't even fucking know?
you 3 assholes laying into 1 guy while everybody else watches.
and you wanna know what's wrong with me?!
Yeah, I'd rather die. So bring it on!
you're fucking crazy, kid.
thank you.
What?!
thank you.
that fucking rocked. Who are you?
I'm Kick-Ass.
dude, you gotta check this shit out.
what is it?
and coming up after the hour.
a costume vigilante has become the latest internet phenomenon...
... after a Hamilton Park resident filmed the man's remarkable intervention...
this is awesome. - Fuck, yeah!
welcome to this special edition of Eye On New York.
how far would you go to help your fellow man?
this colourful individual has been all over the news...
... after a video of his intervention of street gang violence...
... became the most watched clip on the internet.
you 3 assholes laying into 1 guy...
my MySpace: 38 friends. Kick-Ass's MySpace:
... 16, 000 and counting.
this thing was going crazy and I was loving it.
and finally, we want to know who is this man.
does anyone have any idea who this wetsuit crusader is?
he must be someone's son, someone's brother, someone's next door neighbour.
holy shit. What happened?
what happened? This guy happened.
it's a great day for America, everybody.
everybody's favourite superhero right now. Kick-Ass, right?
Yeah!
I like Kick-Ass. His costume is crappy.
he looks like a transvestite...
you know what? Everyone likes Kick-Ass.
did you see the clip? He was actually pretty good.
good at getting his ass kicked.
he should call himself Ass-Kick instead.
that doesn't even make sense.
that guy's gonna end up dead, that's what I think.
are you serious? The guy owns.
I'd e-mail his site if I had a problem worth fixing.
I got 100 guys can fix a problem, you'd hire some putz in pantyhose?
I wouldn't wanna get in the way of your 'business' where I'm not wanted.
I know you have mistaken me for Kick-Ass, but I am not Kick-Ass.
so you don't actually read comics?
ljust started.
I got recommended some like Scott Pilgrim and Shojo Beat, that kinda thing.
I'm not really into the whole superhero thing, though.
so I guess you're not gonna line up forthat new Kick-Ass comic, then?
I guess not. But I was seriously thinking of mailing his site.
I mean, I could really use some help from a guy like that right now.
help? Really? What with?
you know I volunteer at the Needle Exchange?
no, I didn't.
well, there's this one guy, Rasul. I felt so sorry for him and...
...the more I found out about his upbringing and stuff, ljust...
wow, that's weird. I'm usually the one playing therapist.
can I make a confession?
ever since I was little I've always wanted a friend...
...like you.
is it okay to say that? That's not homophobic, is it?
I mean, I don't think you're all the same or anything.
of course not, no.
thank you.
I don't know if I was everything Katie dreamed her gay BFF would be...
... but I tried my best.
more importantly, I talked her into mailing Kick-Ass.
long story short, this particular lame duck of hers...
... turned out to be more of a lame cobra.
she didn't want the money back she'd given him...
... or an apology for the black eye he'd given her.
she just wanted him to get that they were through and leave her alone.
and let's be real, no other request could have given me more pleasure.
who the fuck are you supposed to be? The Green Condom?
you know it ain't Hallowe'en for another few months, kid?
I'm here to see Rasul.
who the fuck are you?
I'm Ki... I'm a friend of Katie's.
kids nowadays in their tights.
so, which one of you guys is Rasul?
I'm Rasul. Can't you tell by my big titties?
what is this? Trick ortreat or something?
fuck. Now I'm dead.
I've a message for Rasul about Katie Deauxma.
Katie?
Oh, you're Rasul?
okay. You gotta stay away from Katie now. It's over.
so if you just leave her alone everything will be fine.
what?
yo, kid. Who the hell are you?
and what is this?
I'm Kick-Ass. Look me up.
and this is me giving you a message. Leave Katie alone.
or what?
or... I'll come back...
...and break your fucking legs.
I'm right here now, baby.
fuck!
hold him.
you are so fucking dead, man.
okay, you cunts. Let's see what you can do now.
Eeny, meeny...
...miny, mo.
what the fuck?!
Hey, I got one of those.
come on.
so you wanna play.
what the fuck?
Oh, dude, that is one gay-looking taser.
relax, we're on the same team.
Hey, get up.
now, Hit Girl, we always keep our backs where?
to the wall, Daddy, I know. It won't happen again.
nice shot, by the way. - Thank you.
let's go.
Hey, asshole, you can't use the front door now.
wait, wait, wait.
what?
who are you?
me?
I'm Hit Girl.
and that's: Big Daddy.
come on.
come on!
hit Girl and Big Daddy.
they were the real deal.
me?
I was just a stupid dick in a wetsuit.
what is this? What am I looking at here?
it was Sal's phone. They found it in his hand.
he must have taken that right before he died.
I know this sounds fucked-up, Frankie, but that guy in the picture...
...I think it's that superhero nut job from the TV.
who?
Kick-Ass?
one guy?
hold on, you're telling me one guy killed 8 of my men tonight?
8 at Sal's place. 4 at that kid Rasul's.
we have no merchandise on the street at all?
right.
one guy? - I think.
if you're right, we'll look like the biggest pussies in New York.
what do you want me to do?
I want Kick-Ass's fucking head on a stick, and I want it now.
I didn't say anything to anyone, I swear.
good move, Ass... Kick. Let's keep it that way.
you know what this is?
it's all the cartridge crap that comes out of your gay little taser when you fire it.
you do know the police could have traced this right back to you if they'd found it?
but lucky foryou... I picked it up.
thank you.
let's call it insurance. Makes it easier for us to take your word.
don't take it personal. We don't trust anybody.
I re-routed your IP address.
finding you was way too easy.
Oh, shit. Shit, I hadn't thought. My God.
I, I owe you.
I'm thinking of shutting my site down anyway.
quitting. I mean, this is... it's fucking insane.
I'm in way over my head.
it's a shame. You have potential.
your call. But you know we're around if you need us.
how do I get a hold of you?
you just contact the Mayor's office.
he has a special signal he shines in the sky.
in the shape of a giant cock.
you need us, put on your website you're on vacation. We'll find you.
hit Girl, back to headquarters.
sweet dreams.
I need you to get rid of Kick-Ass.
yo. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's up? - What's up?
kick-ass is killing my men, Gigante, that's what's up.
my condolences, Frank.
but I'm afraid I can't help you on this one.
little bit outside my jurisdiction. - Outside your jurisdiction?
you're a fucking cop and he's breaking the law.
that's so inside it's ball-deep in your jurisdiction's ass.
listen to me.
the cops pay me to nail the bad guys. You pay me not to.
everything else is in the grey area. - Fuck you very much. Just do it. Okay.
Un-fucking-believable.
Where's Cody? He's late.
thank you, Cody. We appreciate your co-operation.
let me out now?
I gave you all them names and addresses.
Hey, I won't say nothing to nobody.
you and your crazy mid get friend can go bash whoever you want.
Hey, come on.
Hey, I know some very bad people up town. Really nasty individuals.
let me go. Hey, come on.
Hey, hey, don't do this. You don't need to do this. Come on.
please. Hey.
come on, no, no...
no, no, no! Come on, please!
Hey, you're crazy. Please!
what a douche.
you have done self tan before, right?
Yeah, like, I do it all the time.
murder, super heroes breaking into my bedroom.
my life had turned into some fucked-up dream I couldn't wake up from.
even the good parts were totally surreal.
Oh, hey, I read those old Ditko Spidermans you gave me.
they're actually pretty good.
Yeah, they are.
and it's been a whole week since I've heard from Rasul.
that's great.
once upon a time there were 2 supercops called Daddy and Marcus...
... who were very good at getting bad guys.
Frank D'Amico was the baddest guy of them all...
... and he came up with a plan to get rid of Daddy.
being framed as a drug dealer was the worst thing that could have happened to Daddy.
prison was not his natural habitat.
he was very upset.
with Daddy in prison, his pregnant wife was all alone...
... and could not cope.
but all clouds have a silver lining and out of her death...
... Mindy was born.
Marcus became the child's guardian...
... and Daddy started a plan of his very own.
5 years later he left prison, and he was ready.
now it was time for Mindy to get ready, too.
how did you find me, Marcus?
one of us is still a cop, remember?
is this how you brainwashed Mindy?
you say brainwashed, I say made it into a game.
you call this playing, Damon?
vigilante justice. Mass murder. Come on, partner.
so where is she?
she's safe. - Can I see her?
I miss her.
I miss you both.
I appreciate your concern, but you need to go now.
I should warn you, that asshole Gigante is looking for Kick-Ass.
he got something to do with you, Damon?
you started some kind of fucked-up superhero club?
never heard of him. - Okay. Heads up, all right?
you keep carrying on like you been carrying on, it's only a matter of time before Gigante is looking foryou.
he's been on D'Amico's payroll ever since you passed up the opportunity.
you know I'm not gonna stop.
not until D'Amico and his whole damn operation...
...are burnt to ashes and buried.
it ain't gonna bring her back, Damon.
this is not the life for Mindy.
you owe that kid a childhood.
I'll tell you who owes her a childhood.
Frank D'Amico!
holy shit.
I don't fucking believe it.
follow him, round the corner.
not too fast.
what's with the high-fives?
I'll give you a mother fucking high-five.
high-fiving bullshit. Keep going, keep going.
not too close.
he's going in the alley.
he's going in the alley.
okay, when I tell you, stop the car. Ready?
Hey, Kick-Ass.
how you doing?
kill my men, huh? Take my fucking coke!
whoa, whoa, whoa, boss. What are you doing?
boss, come on, we gotta go, baby.
fucking scumbag! - Come on, let's go.
boss, come on, he's had enough.
come on, Frank, he's had enough. Come on.
what the fuck are you looking at? Huh?
come on, come on. Come on, let's go. We gotta go.
fuck. Shit. Damn.
come on, come on, get in.
burke: Chapter one.
sometimes, despite your best efforts otherwise, life will give you lemons.
when that happens, you've got two choices, friend.
you can wear a or make lemonade.
I never should have booked this city.
come on, come on, come on.
Finally!
huh?
what, did you swim here? Might as well have.
this is exactly why I tell you you gotta fly in the night before.
the less time I spend in this city, the better.
I know, I know, I know. But you'll be enthused to know that I reamed customer service.
your bag is gonna be on the very next flight.
but have no fear.
there is a brand-new suit waiting for you right here.
Where'd you conjure this up from?
well, rainmakers make rain...
room key.
there's a gorgeous latte-colored silk tie in there.
I think you're gonna love it. It's subtle... Latte?
okay, there's a red one in there, too. Okay?
can you please just look your best? Please, okay?
listen, all three Unicom suits will fly in from New York day after tomorrow to see if we can make a deal.
all three of them?
I'm Lane goddamned Marshall.
Burke, for once in your life, can you please take the elevator?
see you.
coming to the seminar? Okay.
okay. Big day. Big day.
lane: And don't forget the DVDs and audio books available for purchase all through the week at our booth down the hall.
and now, without further ado, the author of the bestseller A Path Through Grief, my friend...
no, my inspiration, Burke Ryan.
all right!
Thanks, Lane. Wow!
Whoo!
you guys make a guy feel good.
I'm feeling okay. How are you?
all: A-Okay!
good. Let me ask you a question.
any football fans in the house?
certain college team not too long ago lost their season opener.
they're going nowhere fast.
then something happened. Thank you.
an event that changed everything for their coach.
the guy started sleeping at the office, reinvented the playbook, studied film.
he was on the case 24.
they went on to win the national championship.
well, after all the fanfare and the champagne, he traipsed on home, went upstairs, went to his closet and removed his Browning double-barreled shotgun, put it to his chin and pulled the trigger.
see, the event that changed it all back at the beginning of the season?
his brother, his best friend in the world, died of a heart attack.
you might be able to get back on the horse, do great things.
hell, you might even win a national championship.
but if you don't pay the piper, he will come calling.
I want to thank each and every one of you for having the courage to really feel the loss of loved ones.
I know it's not easy.
I've been there.
how are you? You okay?
all: A-Okay!
good. All right. Say it one more time. How are you?
all: A-Okay!
all right. I'll see you in workshop.
Jessica: Perfect. Perfect.
good. Good. Great.
come on, loosen up a little bit. You need a drink?
maybe you need a drink. Waiter!
please, no drink. Chapter 12.
alcohol's no more a cure-all than a Band-Aid on a bullet wound.
all right. Now flash me that sign of yours.
great. Give me that.
great. So, tell me, what motivated the book?
uh, my wife died.
I know.
why tell the whole world about it?
it was a way to coach myself how to get through it.
you know, I never intended for anyone to actually read it, but my manager gave it to a publisher and here I am.
Yes, you are. What happened?
uh...
she was driving us to dinner.
dog in the middle of the road.
car swerved into a pole.
she died instantly.
it must have been awful. I'm sorry.
appreciate it.
well, I think I got what I needed.
great! Fantastic. Nice to meet you, Jessica.
nice to meet you.
you take care.
woman: Thanks.
this way, guys. Follow Burke.
all right, everybody.
those of you who signed up for the morning work group, you're in for a treat.
let's go! Let's go!
come out in the middle here. Excuse us.
thank you. Excuse us for a second.
sorry. Come on out here.
come on, everybody out.
I want you to take a moment and look around and tell me what you see and what you hear.
okay? All right.
okay.
Lorraine.
cars. Honking cars.
good. Natalie?
jackhammers.
anybody else? MAN: Stoplights.
stoplights. Cement.
a homeless person.
trash.
middle fingers.
good. Excellent.
now remember that and follow me.
burke: All right. Now what do you see? Lorraine?
the ocean.
good. MAN 1: Trees.
man 2: The Space Needle.
skyscrapers.
mount Rainier.
man 3: Rivers.
man 4: Beautiful rivers.
woman: The sun. Good.
man 5: Naked hot-tubber.
Wow. Little bit different up here, isn't it?
and yet, it's the same.
we haven't gone anywhere.
we're just looking at things from a new perspective.
inside of each of you, there are sirens, honking horns and gridlock, but there's also this.
we just have to do the work and climb the stairs to find it.
you have the reporter at noon and I think you're gonna like her a lot.
look, I don't really give a rat's ass what your cancellation policy is.
I am leaving and I want my money back.
sir, it's not that simple. I'll be right back.
our cancellation policy clearly...
Hi. Becky? What seems to be the trouble here?
Mr. Ryan, this gentleman is refusing to adhere...
thank you. Hi. I'm Burke.
you are?
Walter Mayfield.
Walter. Where you from?
Billings. Drove out from Billings.
Montana. That's quite a drive.
Yeah. Look, I don't think this thing is for me, okay?
okay. You mind if I ask why?
well, frankly, my sister talked me into it, and the...
you know, the whole... And the feelings...
I understand. I understand.
can I ask you, why did your sister think it was so important for you to come here?
my son.
and what's his name? Stephen.
and when did he... Does it really matter?
it matters to me, Walter. I'd like to hear.
do you have a picture?
I'm sorry.
Walter, I know how you feel. I've been there.
my wife died. Three years ago.
I want you to know that you've taken the first step just by walking through these doors, and something inside you, whether you know it or not, made you drive all this way.
if you want to leave, we'll honor your request.
I hope you don't.
Thanks, Becky. Think about it.
burke: Chapter two. Happiness is a state of mind and, like all things, it takes practice.
devote five minutes a day to smiling, just smiling, and after a while it'll come naturally.
sorry. I didn't mean to...
Hey, you forgot your pen!
what can I get you?
I would like another Seven-and-Seven, and a tomato juice for my virtuous friend here.
tomato juice.
thank you.
so, as far as Unicom knows,
I'm a hair away from signing a deal with Time Warner. Okay?
I'm expecting the offer by lunchtime tomorrow.
that means TV, radio, publishing. All of it.
are you as hot for me right now as I am hot for me right now?
so hot.
and check it.
Ted Vernon, the CEO himself, is gonna fly in for the end of the seminar.
my guess, a little warm and fuzzy contract-inking party.
who knows?
your drinks, gentlemen.
thank you.
I'll get you a Learjet.
you like Learjets?
lane.
come on. You know that's not why I wrote it.
you do know that you're helping people, right, man?
this is your moment.
you have to give yourself permission to enjoy it, brother.
come on, man. Live a little.
Yeah.
Yeah.
what?
you're right.
excuse me. I'm sorry.
Hi. Do you remember me? From the hallway upstairs?
you dropped your pen.
um...
would you like to have a cup of coffee?
Ah.
right. Um...
well, we could bring him along if you want. Double your pleasure.
I'm sorry. I... I... You...
see you, Ricky.
later, Eloise.
Hey, baby. What's this? Delivery.
Wow. I was in the neighborhood, so I figured I'd bring you lunch 'cause I knew you'd be working so hard.
wow, you didn't have to do that.
polished up, ready to go.
Hey, Eloise.
ELOISE: Hi, lan.
how's your boss treating you today?
Oh, he's all right.
the lead singer of the Stereo Kings trashed his Les Paul.
look at that fretboard, man. As good as new.
make sure he signs for it.
Ian: No problem.
did you have company?
um...
Yeah. I told you Frank and I were working last night.
Frank wears lipstick?
Hey, listen. EI, it's not what you think.
it's business. Totally platonic.
you know what? You used that one last time.
no, she's got ties to Sony. Hey!
listen to me. You gotta listen to me. Eloise!
I don't want to hear it.
burke: How you doing today?
man: Pretty good, thanks.
all right. Okay.
what's your name?
Alberto.
see you at workshop, okay? Goodbye.
Mr. Ryan.
you are something. Yes, sir.
say, would you mind signing that to "Donald and Shirley," please?
there you go.
say, do you mind if I share?
share?
Yeah. See, there's this fellow in his 60s and he thinks he's just gonna, you know, sail through his retirement.
but then one day, three years and 13 days ago, his daughter dies.
and the truth is he hasn't been doing very well.
he doesn't sleep much, and he and his wife, well...
you can understand.
but his daughter's husband, well, he doesn't seem to be having any of these kinds of problems. No.
she was crushed to death in a car crash, but he, well...
he's making lemonade out of lemons. Isn't that how it goes?
when are you gonna stop lying, son?
hypocrite.
Burke, I am so sorry.
God. The balls on him!
I'm fine.
who does he think he is?
her father.
even so, way over the line.
forget that. You know what? She'd be proud of you.
all right, you're pissed off at me.
a thousand times you said no to Seattle, but I wouldn't listen.
you gotta be pissed off at me.
I'm fine.
Burke?
CYNTHIA: So, take a good look at them, mister. A little preview of tonight.
I know how you love the high heels.
I'll see you tonight at 8: 00. Standing tall.
big kiss.
love you.
MARTY: "So, my ass don't fit no Cosmo cover "You think I can't be some hot animal lover?
you scared of my cerebral cortex? That I'm Gloria's fish, chromosome X?
or maybe you're just afraid of my battery-operated sex
what do you think?
hello.
there's something wrong with that girl.
she said she wanted to hear it.
Marty. Slam poetry, coffee house.
my shop, work. Please.
Yes, ma'am.
are there any new receivables?
just that birthday arrangement I told you about.
right. Great.
Marty, you did not cauterize the stems.
Oh.
I was just about to.
you know what? Here's what happens.
the sap pollutes the water and then they die twice as fast.
I know, I know, I know, I know. I'll get it. I promise.
I don't understand this. We have roses, we have all of these.
I mean, come on. These are flowers living out of water.
are you all right?
look, I just had a really... I've had a really bad couple of days, okay?
would you like to talk to me about it?
no, I don't.
because you weren't this mad the last time I forgot to cauterize.
Tyler.
and some groupie.
again?
Yeah.
no. No!
I know. It's crazy.
I can't believe it.
God, you know what? No, I can believe it. I can totally believe it.
excuse me. What does that mean? What does that mean?
it's so clear to me.
Oh.
it means that you manage to choose guys that guarantee that at some point, we are going to be standing here having this same conversation again.
and you're gonna be shocked at the outcome of the relationship again.
but most of all,
I just hate seeing you get so disappointed and hurt every single time.
am I being too harsh?
Yes. No.
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna...
cauterize. Yeah.
burke: It was because they were feeling pain and resentment.
I want you to re-read Chapter 12, okay?
the cigarettes are more than just a habit. They're a denial mechanism.
Oh.
okay?
mental health begins with...
physical health." Okay.
and how you always say it's important to remember the person, how they lived, not how they died?
well, my husband loved my oatmeal-raisin cookies so much.
so, I took his ashes and...
meet my Stanley.
don't those look delicious?
I'll see you in workshop.
Oh, thank him.
...event next week in the Junior Ballroom.
but then Julie was wondering if we could get the side...
excuse me. ...arrangements. Excuse...
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, there's been a healing.
you like making a fool of people, pretending to be Helen Keller?
uh, well, technically, she was blind also, so...
okay. Will you excuse us for a second?
thank you.
see, I happen to know a thing or two about people.
you get approached a lot.
probably have since the day you strapped on your first training bra.
but you're smart and you're creative and you're caring and deep.
but how come the guys only see the package it comes in?
sure, you're flattered, but ultimately, ultimately, it's tiresome because it has nothing to do with you. You were born that way.
you can't take credit for it. Your insides, though. That's yours.
that's what you want someone to truly see, even a stranger.
ergo, you fake a handicap rather than deign to have a conversation with a fellow human being.
you prefer sign language? Fine.
smooth. Real smooth.
ha!
excuse me. This is the men's room.
you know what? Excuse me.
what did you have in mind?
some sweet, romantic courtship in the bar over some warm peanuts before we consummate our love in the glow of Spectravision porn?
you...
God, I'm so sorry your little ego took such a bruising.
but you know what? I bet the next chick that you meet in the elevator or, I don't know, the gym, is gonna fit that bill just fine. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
even though I bet you have a wife who is actually stupid enough to believe that you're the one guy with integrity. The one guy.
until, of course, she finds that lipstick mark on your boxers, and then it's game over, pal.
and that one thing that you held so dear, that one thing that you loved more than anything in the world, is tainted and ruined and destroyed like that.
ergo, if you had a brain in either head, you would realize that I was doing us both a favor.
excuse me.
sure. No problem.
is that my flower you're wearing?
no.
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, it is.
but I... I took it before, when I thought you were deaf.
hmm?
not that I would steal from a deaf person.
all right.
goodbye.
my God.
all right, this one's ready.
Where's that headed? Don't know.
he said you'd know where it was going.
Hi.
Hi.
don't you look grand.
thank you. My, my, fancy.
thank you. All right.
the concierge said it's good.
that's good. He should know.
Yeah.
it stopped raining.
it sure did.
Carrot-ginger and the spinach soup.
you know, I have to say, I have never been on a date with someone who has a cardboard cutout of themselves.
well, I mean, they're... They're really...
they're good for the carpool lane.
Oh.
got it.
you know, we take long walks on the beach together, go fly kites.
he's the kite.
because he's cardboard. Right.
your salads. Enjoy.
thank you. Thank you.
so...
Quidnunc"?
Yeah.
you weren't really supposed to see that, but, you know...
they're just... They're just words.
so, there's more than one, or...
Mmm-mmm.
thank you.
well, your concierge called it. That was real good.
right. Thank you.
my pleasure.
so, I gotta... I'm gonna go. I've got...
it's a school night for me, so...
I understand.
it was very nice. Thank you. Okay.
all right. Thank you. Great.
goodbye. See you later. Thanks.
Eloise!
Eloise!
Oh.
you know, I haven't... I haven't been on a date in three years.
cause see, I was... I was married.
and I mean, normally, I'm... I'm quite dashing and debonair and whatever other "D" word there is that would really impress you.
but it's painfully apparent that I'm... I'm a little rusty.
why... Why wouldn't you just say so?
I don't know, a desperate attempt to hold on to whatever shred of masculinity that I have left?
okay. So...
so then I'm your... I'm your first since a divorce?
uh, you are the first... Well, that's good.
because that explains a lot. Because that in there...
it was... It was bad.
really bad.
well, I have to go pick some phalangiums right now.
would you like to come with me?
Yeah.
good.
personally, I like to put the waffles and bacon in first.
I'm increasing the pH level.
Hey. You do your thing.
I'm still trying to wrap my head around what your thing is.
you're just gonna have to read my book.
you're slippery.
I prefer "mysterious.
how long you been at this?
Oh, I've always wanted to do it.
I finally got up the guts a couple of years ago to open my own shop.
good for you.
Julie, we have never met...
no. Hey!
Wow. Nosy.
I'm sorry.
sorry. I don't mean to...
but these are just... They're from deliveries.
they're copies I've made of cards that have, you know, stuck with me.
so... Can I...
Really? Would you... Yeah. I'd like to.
okay.
Julie, we have never met, "but I've watched you lovingly all these years.
congratulations and have a beautiful wedding.
love, your father.
may I?
um...
let's see.
Stacy, these are supposed to last two weeks.
I'll be back in time to see them bloom.
Yeah, deployed Marine. He never saw them bloom.
one last one.
my dearest wife, happy 50th anniversary.
sorry about the rug burns last night.
thanks for the visual.
life on a 3-by-5.
okay, well, I mean, if this is the candle of truth, then I guess I should be honest.
I... I used her life insurance money for a down payment on a condo in Mexico.
well, because we had talked about it before. He liked the idea.
so, I... I made a mold of his, you know...
that way, when he was gone, we could still, you know...
burke: Who's next?
Walter?
not much to say, really.
Walter, there's always something to say. Come on, tell us.
how did your son die?
I used to be a contractor. He was my little right-hand man.
only 12, but he could frame a garden shed better than I could.
we stopped by my construction site.
I had to pick up some blueprints from my trailer.
I told him to wait in the car.
he fell off a scaffold and snapped his spinal cord in two.
just like...
just like that.
and every day...
every day is...
I should've known he wouldn't stay in the car.
Walter, you said, "I used to be a contractor.
I can't even walk into a hardware store.
I clean buildings at night now.
and I lost my business.
my wife left me.
thank you, Walter.
there's a dirty little secret. It's fear.
how many here don't fly anymore?
come on, raise your hands.
who here gets an annual checkup three times a year?
how many of you don't take elevators or gave up skiing, biking, surfing, kayaking, whatever it might be?
well, listen to me. Fear is a state of mind.
we're gonna prove that right now.
burke: Let's put our hands together.
ready? Here we go.
step, step, step, step.
okay? Come on, Natalie.
burke: The only thing separating you and me is in your head.
come on. You can do this. Come on.
okay. Walter?
come on, Walter! MAN: Come on, Walter!
burke: Here we go!
come on, Walter!
here we go.
woman: Come on, Walter!
come on!
Walter.
it's okay. It's okay.
I'm sorry. This is just silly.
I'm not gonna feel A-Okay because I walked across some damn coals.
okay, then it shouldn't be that big of a deal, Walter.
it's not a big deal. It's just...
it's a step.
it's an important step.
well, it has nothing to do with my Stephen.
Walter, would Stephen want you like this?
or would he want you to move on, to take a step forward?
you don't know anything about my son.
Walter, watch.
Walter, come on.
come on, Walter. You can do this.

he'll get there.
all right, well, let's give ourselves a round of applause
for daring to kick fear right where it hurts.
buddy, this stuff is gonna hurt.
how many layers of skin do you think you have?
not enough.
you know, you can't do the work for them.
you know that, right?
the guy needs help.
fine, but you can't do it for them.
this is gonna sting a little bit.
ready?

Ooh.
look at that. I like that picture.
Wow. Are you kidding me?

Hey, I gotta take them down to the museum and show them around like an idiot...
did that beep? Hey, Burke. It's me, Eloise.
burke: So, where are we going?
ELOISE: It's all good. You'll see.
okay, I will be right back.

I'm just gonna go grab something.
I mean, you're more than welcome to come in.
okay.
okay.
ELOISE: Hi, Mom.
Oh. Hi, honey.
Bob left the keys on the counter.
Oh, great.
great. How was your day?
Oh, fine. I had lots of coupons.
Oh, really? So, that was busy, huh?
Mmm-hmm.
Hi. I brought you flowers.
Oh. Those are so pretty. Thanks.
mom, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
I wasn't expecting company.
Hi. I'm Burke.
Burke Ryan!
Ellie, you didn't tell me you were dating a celebrity.
well, we're not dating.
I wish you would have told me. I look like hell.
not at all. It's just the opposite.
I see where Eloise gets her looks.
let's show him your pictures.
you know, no, I don't think so...
I'd love to.
no, really.
you know... Okay, I'm gonna get the keys.
my word, you have Pocahontas here.
Eloise was state archery champion two years in a row.
no. Oh, Mother.
don't be modest. This is Burke Ryan.
I loved you on The Today Show.
now how old is she here?
okay. I got those keys, so thank you for that.
we gotta go. Look how cute you are here.
A-Okay. A-Okay.
it was very nice meeting you. Nice to meet you.
hope to see you again. Yeah. Take care. Bye-bye.
I am so glad you're not dating that musician.
mother. Oh, God.
I love you. Thanks. Thank Bob.
Burke Ryan. Oh, my God!
Wow. She's so sweet.
she loves you.
I really enjoyed that.
it was very sweet.
Oh, Mom. No, no, no. This way. Come on.
where are we going?
it's fun not knowing, isn't it?
Ah.
you'll see.
what, are you trying to avoid the FBI?
you'll see. Please, just get in the truck.
I think I forgot my hard hat.
Oh, really? Well, here you go.
what you doing?
your chariot awaits.
Seriously? Me, in bucket?
Yes. Trust me.
have you had any cold medicine today?
not today.
we're good. Okay, now watch this.
very dangerous. Fingers. Uh-huh.
lock us in. Got it?
do you know what you're doing? Uh-huh.
ready? Oh, Lord.
are we in? Buckled?
locked? Loaded? Okay.
all right, here lies Burke Ryan, dead...
Oh, stop it. I had a crash course this morning from Bob.
who is Bob, and why is my life in his hands?
Bob's my mom's neighbor.
current boyfriend of the moment.
Mmm-hmm.
okay. Here's what I was thinking.
I wanted to pick up from last night.
and I wanted to get you tickets to Rogue Wave, but they've been sold out for weeks.
so, I figured where there is a will, there is a way.
man: Heaven is a switchboard that you want to fight
she would even miss you if you taught her sight
power politician leaning to the right
baby's got a trust fund that she'll want to go off like that
get off my stack
leave a little window
get off of my stack
now we wear same-colored yellow uniforms
sky is burning but at least we're warm
if I had a nickel for every time I saw a concert from a telephone truck, I'd be...
thank you. It was exquisite.
don't thank me. Thank Bob.
thank you, Bob.
Hey, I got your book.
I'm halfway through it.
Really?
well, wait till you get to the recipe chapters.
they're top-notch.
I'm sorry about your wife.
how come you didn't tell me that's what happened?
I don't know. Never came up.
well, it sounded like you really loved her.
Yeah, I did.
but that was a long time ago.
three years?
twenty-one in dog years.
I had a really, really great time.
me, too. That was really fun.
what?
I'm waiting to watch you strut back to your bitchin' rig.
all right.
Bye.
dear Michael. Of course it's you. Who else could they send?
who else could be trusted?
and I know it's a long way and you're ready to go to work.
all I'm saying is wait, just wait, just... Just please hear me out.
because this is not an episode, relapse, fuckup.
I'm begging you, Michael, I'm begging you.
try and make believe this is not just madness...
... because this is not just madness.
two weeks ago, I came out of the building, okay?
I'm running across 6th Avenue, there's a car waiting...
... I got exactly 38 minutes to get to the airport, and I'm dictating.
there's this panicked associate sprinting along beside me...
... scribbling in a notepad, and she starts screaming.
and I realize we're standing in the middle of the street...
... the light's changed and there's this wall of serious traffic speeding towards us.
and I freeze. I can't move.
I'm suddenly consumed with the overwhelming sensation...
... that I'm covered with some sort of film.
and it's in my hair, in my face. And it's like a glaze, like a coating.
and at first I thought, "Oh, my God, I know what this is."
this is some sort of amniotic, embryonic fluid.
I'm drenched in afterbirth.
I've breached the chrysalis. I've been reborn.
but then, the traffic, the stampede, the cars, the trucks, the horns...
... this poor woman screaming, and I'm thinking, "No. This is not rebirth."
this is some kind of giddy illusion of renewal...
... that happens in the final moment before death.
and then I realize, "No, no, no, this is completely wrong..."
... because I looked back at the building...
... and I had the most stunning moment of clarity.
I realized, Michael...
... that I had emerged, not through the doors of Kenner, Bach and Ledeen...
... not through the portals of our vast and powerful law firm...
... but from the asshole of an organism...
... whose sole function is to excrete the poison...
... the ammo, the defoliant necessary for other larger...
... more powerful organisms to destroy the miracle of humanity.
and that I had been coated in this patina of shit...
... for the best part of my life.
and the stench of it, the stain of it would take the rest of my life to undo.
and you know what I did?
I took a deep, cleansing breath and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.
I said to myself, "As clear as this may be, as potent a feeling as this is..."
... as true a thing as I believe that I have witnessed today, it must wait.
it must stand the test of time.
and, Michael, the time is now.
I'm not sure what else I can tell you that I haven't already.
tell me about U/North, Barry. They're your clients.
so you tell me why you're settling a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.
because I'm writing this story whether you like it or not.
what does that exactly mean?
give me something I can print.
we found 97.
I've got that cunt from The Wall Street Journal on my cell phone.
she will not go away.
Marty Bach. How can I help you?
Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein. We're going with a story tomorrow...
... about a settlement in the U/North defoliant case. You wanna comment?
case you're referring to is now, as it has been for the past six years...
...pending and unresolved.
till such time as our client has their day in court...
...or the plaintiffs drop the suit, I'll have nothing of value to tell you.
come on, Marty, you're closing the U/North case. You're settling.
I know that. I know you're up there with 600 people jamming this thing through.
here's what I know. Your deadline was 20 minutes ago.
so you're fishing for a story or trying to get out of writing a retraction.
in either case, I wish you the best of luck.
where the fuck is Karen Crowder?
I'll see the turn.
check.
check.
check.
half the pot. Two hundred.
two hundred to go.
you don't remember me, huh?
we played together a couple times.
that lamp place on Bowery.
that guy's showroom? All the lamps and shit?
the Galaxy. - That's it.
you had a restaurant you were opening, right?
my old partner bid that job, the plumbing.
you don't remember me? - I remember you.
because I lost a lot of weight since then.
you bought some hair too.
with your money.
so, what happened with the bar?
you just had to be a rock star, huh?
shit, man. I want to listen to Larry King, I go home and put the fucking TV on.
that was a good location.
Yeah, that's what my partner kept telling me.
action's on you.
I bet the pot.
good to see you again.
Hello?
Michael. - Walter.
Michael, thank God, there you are. Look, I got a situation.
a big problem, all right? A client of mine, he just called, he hit a guy with his car.
he thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.
just now?
Yeah, just now. Ten, 15 minutes ago. He's driving home.
he's home now. He's there waiting.
where?
Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda. He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.
is he drunk?
no. It's the first thing I asked him. He's good, he's sober.
tell him to stay off the phone.
all right. But you're on it? You can get up there?
because this guy, he's a huge client.
this is half my book, this guy, okay?
I'm walking to the car now.
okay. Look, look, let me call him right back and I'll get the address.
just let me know you're on the way, and I'll get back to you with the details.
all right. I'll be in the car.
what they did, see, they changed the grade there.
they widened the street.
I'm sure somebody told them that that was an improvement.
but now, you see, when it rains and when there is fog, and with this new angle...
...and they've got these new... These... These...
these sodium lamps, it's blinding.
that corner there. It is blinding. - They'll have to work that out.
and it's not just tonight. I've been saying this for years.
I mean, how many times have we talked about that corner? Dell?
Mr. Greer, we don't have a lot of time here.
so the circumstances, the road conditions, none of this holds any interest for you?
what interests me is finding the strongest criminal attorney...
...that can be here in 15 minutes.
well, that sounds ominous.
we have some good relationships up here in Westchester.
so, what are you? What are you? You're not a lawyer?
not the kind you need. - What kind is that?
a trial lawyer.
somebody who can see this through. That's not what I do.
okay. I think we're gonna have to pull Walter back in on this.
I wanna get Walter back on the phone, get him back into the mix.
because, I'll be frank with you, I don't like the way this is going.
sir, we don't have time for Walter. Your options are gonna get smaller quickly.
what options? I'm not hearing any options!
I suggest you go local...
...and I'm telling you there are people here I like for this.
great. That's it? That's what you got for me?
Hey, you believe this?
I have been a client at Kenner, Bach for 12 years!
you think I paid that retainer every month for a place at the back of the line?
Mr. Greer, you left the scene of an accident on a slow weeknight...
...six miles from the state police barracks.
if there's a line, you're right up front.
I can get a lawyer any time I want. I don't need you for that.
we're not sitting here for 45 minutes waiting for a goddamn referral!
I don't know what Walter promised you...
a miracle worker! That's Walter on the phone, 20 minutes ago.
direct quote, okay? "Hang tight. I'm sending you a miracle worker."
well, he misspoke. - About what?
that you're the firm's fixer? Or that you're good at it?
Elliot.
the guy was running! In the street!
you take that, you add the fog, you add the lamps, you add the angle...
what the fuck is he doing running in the middle of the street at midnight?!
you answer me that!
what if someone had stolen the car?
happens all the time.
cops like hit-and-runs.
they work them hard, they clear them fast.
right now there's a B C.I. Unit pulling paint chips off a guard rail.
tomorrow, they're gonna be looking for the owner of a custom-painted...
...hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-12.
and the guy you hit?
if he got a look at the plates, it won't even take that long.
there's no play here.
there's no angle. There's no champagne room.
I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor.
the math on this is simple.
the smaller the mess, the easier it is for me to clean up.
that's the police, isn't it?
no.
they don't call.
hello.
Jerry, it's Michael Clayton.
Yeah, look, I'm sorry to wake you up.
no. I'm in the neighborhood.
you got a pen?
mom, where's my cards?
Where's my cards?
is my other deck in here?
did you eat?
dad's down there waiting already.
there were cards in our bathroom.
Yes, I had a waffle.
since we're out of waffles, I don't see how that's possible.
it's a miracle.
gloves?
Henry!
come on.
get in.
got it?
so no one's even sure exactly where they are...
...because there's no borders or landmarks or anything.
and the town? It's not even a town really.
it just is this camp where all these people have gathered to hide.
right.
all these deserters and guys that got cut off from their armies.
all these people that are hiding in the woods, trying to stay alive.
this is where they all came.
there's Thieves, Gray Mages, Unbidden Warriors...
...Dark Avians, Riverwynders and Sappers.
there's, like, 15 different characters, okay? - Okay.
and nobody has any alliances.
you can't even say who you are because, you don't know...
...maybe the person you're talking to...
...maybe they're like your mortal enemy in the wars.
so it's just completely like everybody for themselves.
sounds familiar.
it's really good. I'm serious, you should really read it.
right. But by the time I finish it, you'll be on to something else.
how much you wanna bet? - I don't know. How much you got?
you got your bus pass? - It's in my locker.
you're not even gonna look at it, are you?
the book? - Yes.
bring it on Saturday, I'll...
I did already. I left it in your kitchen. It's got a red cover.
okay.
well, here we go.
go. Teach these people something, would you?
see you later, Dad. - Yeah, kiddo.
Thanks.
lot 52, lot of assorted mixing bowls, assorted sizes.
thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars. Thirty dollars I have.
you can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50. Sixty dollars back there.
sixty dollars, get me to 70. I got 70 dollars.
seventy dollars, I have now, 70. Eighty dollars there.
eighty dollars, this gentleman here. Eighty dollars.
ninety dollars there. Give me 100. One hundred I have now.
he says you're still gonna be short.
how short?
sixty. Plus the points, 75 thousand.
that's liquor and everything? - What'd you think it was gonna be?
I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.
he took 1500 on a refrigerator I paid four grand for.
make a bid.
are you telling me you don't have the 75 thousand?
just lying around, no.
we both know it's your brother I should be talking to.
forget that.
Michael, look, you wanna front this, that's up to you.
but Timmy's name stays in the book till we're clear.
if I know where he is, I don't have to keep asking.
he's upstate. His wife took him back. I don't know where he is.
he's gotta have something.
he's got the two kids with her.
he's got Jennifer, the coke-dealing waitress that he knocked up.
he's got four Michelin radials that he stole from my sister's garage.
make an offer.
I had a wife who was a drunk. She was a beautiful girl, young girl.
but live like that? Even they do a program... She did, I think, once, two years.
and then they slip? Forget it.
it's like you're strapped to a bomb.
what's my timeframe here?
I don't know.
I didn't think it'd be a problem.
I'll ask.
Hey, Michael. - Morning, Carl.
I don't know. Del, I don't know how hard you want me to press here.
let me know how brave he wants to be.
well, I'm not sure how brave he can be right now.
we just got a confirmation hearing scheduled.
any chance she knows that?
well, it was in the paper. Who knows? Maybe she got someone to read it to her.
she called his wife yesterday. She's calling his house.
this is a total nightmare.
well, my guess is she's gonna want the condo.
come on, that's insane.
well, what can I tell you? Don't piss off a motivated stripper.
it's just unbelievable.
all right. Well, find out his pain threshold and get back to me.
or you can tell him to call me directly.
all right, I hear you. Let me get into it.
Thanks.
Hey, where are we with Marty?
we left word.
hold on. Go back. How old is the kid?
he's not a kid. He's 22.
this is Miami? - Nope. Key Biscayne.
and they charged him.
reckless endangerment. My client...
I think really what they want, they want a reality check on the attorney down there.
Yeah. - Wayne said you have some connections?
Yeah, let me get a pen. - Thank you.
now, if she calls the INS directly, she's gonna get nowhere.
even with the appointment?
it's retail, Evan. It's like the DMV over there.
unless they get a call from a district supervisor, then nobody moves.
but your guy can do that?
he's a former commissioner.
none of this comes back to me? Because that doesn't do any good.
no, look, I'm gonna be the one that's asking.
can you hang on a minute? - Yeah, sure.
are we merging?
Marty Bach's in London.
they said he was in Atlanta, then Lara said he was in the building.
so I called back. I know you want this meeting.
now she tells me the truth. He's really in London.
so are we merging? I mean, that's what everyone's saying.
all these Brits? That this time it's for real.
like I would know.
I don't know.
but even if we are, I mean, even if they merged, it wouldn't affect us, right?
your phone's ringing.
Evan?
Hey. Okay, here's what I'll do.
let me give him a call and set up a meeting for next week.
I'll walk her in, I'll make the introduction...
at the moment, U/North currently has 70, 000 employees...
... in 62 countries around the world.
around the planet.
operating in 62 countries around the planet.
at work in more than 60 countries around the globe.
we have... We have, right now... We have...
at U/North right now, we've got 75, 000 employees...
...in over 60 countries around the planet.
we are a very successful and highly diversified company...
...so you can imagine...
...the volume and the variety of legal issues we have to deal with is...
overwhelming.
it's just enormous.
so you can imagine, the volume of legal issues...
it's quite substantial.
and as general counsel, what I do...
...what our in-house department does...
...is to analyze the dimension of the problem or the opportunity...
...to determine the jurisdiction...
...and to outsource our business...
...to those firms and talents that we think can help us the most.
so with all that pressure and workload...
... how do you keep a balance between work and life?
balance?
I think that's... That's something that...
...you search for your whole life, isn't it?
it's a shifting balance, really.
it's, you know, you... You try to...
when you really are enjoying what it is you do...
...who needs balance?
there's your balance. There's your balance.
when you're really enjoying what it is you do, there is your balance.
when Don asked me to take...
when Don Jeffries brought... Don Jeffries brought me...
don Jeffries brought me in here 12 years ago...
...trusted me, mentored me.
welcomed me into the U/North family.
and when he moved up to the boardroom, I never really...
...dreamt that I would have the opportunity to move into his position.
but, is it challenging? Yes.
and I think that it's possible that those first few months were a little shaky.
but then you realize that you've been taught to be ready, and you take the helm.
because if you're not comfortable with that level of responsibility...
...you're in the wrong place.
it's your department, your capacity to make tough decisions in real time, and...
we're in the middle of an interview.
they said it was urgent.
Jesus.
for chrissake.
you're saying he did this in...?
Oh, my God.
Barry. - Hang on.
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked in a deposition room in Milwaukee.
Oh, Michael...
... I took a deep, cleansing breath and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.
I said to myself, "As clear as this may be, as potent a feeling as this is..."
... as true a thing as I believe that I have witnessed today, it must wait.
it must stand the test of time.
and, Michael, the time is now.
this moment, today, here, this room, this air...
... and this, especially this, Michael, that you're here.
there's a reason.
a reason it's you, Michael.
surely, you have some sense of that, how it pulls together, how it gathers.
nurse Michael, the secret hero, the keeper of the hidden sins.
tell me you can see that, Michael, for God's sake.
but, I mean, yeah, yes, yes. The nudity, the parking lot, I admit it.
it was... It was... It was a mistake. It was wrong. It was lame.
it was obvious. And therapeutically, it was completely useless...
...because I swear, I could stand here and tear off my fucking skin...
...and I could not get down to where this thing is living.
six years, Michael. Six years I've absorbed this poison.
four hundred depositions, a hundred motions, five changes of venue...
...85, 000 documents in discovery.
six years of scheming and stalling and screaming, and what have I got?
I've spent 12 percent of my life defending the reputation of a deadly weed killer!
we had an agreement, Arthur. - One night.
one night, right? I look up and there's Marty in my office.
he's got some champagne.
he tells me we just hit 30, 000 billable hours on U/North and he wants to celebrate.
so an hour later, I find myself in a whorehouse in Chelsea...
...with two Lithuanian redheads taking turns sucking my dick.
I'm laying there and I'm trying not to come and I wanna...
I wanna make it last, so I start doing the math.
I think, "Thirty thousand hours, what is that? That's 24 times 30.
that's 720 hours in a month, 8760 hours in a year...
Arthur. - No, wait, wait, wait!
because it's years! It's lives!
and the numbers are making me dizzy and, you know...
...now, instead of trying not to come, I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.
I mean, is this me?
am I this freak organism that has been sent here to sleep and eat...
...and defend this one horrific chain of carcinogenic molecules?
is that my destiny? Is that my fate?
listen, you promised me. - Is that it, Michael?
is that my grail? Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?
is that the correct answer to the multiple choice of me?
you wanna go off your medication, that's fine. But you call me first.
that was our agreement. - Sue me.
we okay in there?
we're fine. We're fine.
they killed them, Michael.
those small farms, the family farms.
did you...? Did you...? Did you meet Anna?
no.
you gotta see her, you gotta talk to her. She's a miracle, Michael.
she's God's perfect little creature.
and for 50 million dollars in fees, I've spent 12 percent of my life...
...destroying perfect Anna and her dead parents and her dying brother.
when did you last take one of these?
no. I'm not losing this. Everything is finally significant.
the world is a beautiful place. I'm not trading that.
if it's real, the pill won't kill it. - I have blood on my hands.
you are senior litigating partner of one of the largest...
...most respected law firms in the world. You are a legend.
I'm an accomplice! - You're a manic-depressive.
I am Shiva, the god of death.
let's get out of Milwaukee, we'll talk about it.
we came back from the hospital and everybody was crying...
... and we were in shock, but we still... We had to milk.
the cows won't wait, will they?
no.
and when you went to the barn?
we found the note. My sister found it.
from your mother? - Yes.
could you read it for us, please?
just read the third paragraph, just the highlighted section there.
I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy or any of the people...
Anna.
Anna. - Down at...
it's all right, Anna, go on.
I'm just... - Excuse me.
Anna, they're... - What's he doing?
excuse me. She's a... No, this is testimony. This is...
excuse me, I have an objection.
you can be a witness here. You can be a witness.
I am not a witness to this, sir, l...
Anna, I love you.
and I'm sitting here and I'm listening to you and I swear...
... that I love you more than anything in the world. And this is my moment.
this strange conference-table moment.
turn off that camera!
this is my offering! - No, I want this on the record!
how do I turn it off?
this is my offering. My clothes are my offering. This is my shame.
my credentials! I'm ashamed!
and I love you, and I swear to God...
I guess that's it.
when do we get Don?
she said to try back in half an hour.
and how about the flights? What's the story at O'Hare?
closed four minutes ago. - Shit.
there is a foot of snow in Detroit already.
Todd, could I get that coffee now?
who is this guy they sent from New York? Clayton? I never heard of him.

and then in 1990, he starts at Kenner, Bach and Ledeen.
so he's a partner?
no. He's listed as special counsel.
says he specializes in wills and trusts.
he goes from criminal prosecution to wills and trusts?
he's been there 17 years, he's not a partner?
this is the guy they send? Who is this guy?
Hi. - Close the door.
all right. So nobody, none of you, had any idea he was coming?
to Milwaukee? For a deposition?
we thought there was a settlement. There's been some rumors.
okay. Look, it's very simple. Arthur has a chemical imbalance.
he's supposed to be taking his medication. He's fallen behind on that.
he's on the mend. He'll be fine in three or four days.
now, I wanna make this crystal clear. What happened here stays in this room.
this is not a piece of information you wanna be out in front of.
anybody has a problem with that, I need to know right now.
all right.
we're stuck here overnight.
I'm gonna take him home tomorrow if I can.
who's in charge of the deposition schedule?
I am. - Where do we stand with that?
I guess it's on hold. We didn't know what to do.
nothing is on hold. Keep doing what you were.
other side wants to talk, they can call New York.
I need his briefcase. - Arthur's? I don't... I didn't see it.
he said it was in the room. - It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.
find it.
so all these people, they all start having these dreams, okay?
you know what a vision quest is? You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?
Yeah. I think so. Like a...
like a special dream.
except this is like a whole bunch of people having the same dream.
they're all having this dream that they should go to this one place.
they don't know why or anything.
they just have this feeling that they have to go there.
that they've been summoned.
that's the chapter.
seriously, that's what it's called: "Summons to Conquest.
that's the title.
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know they're all having the same dream?
no. That's what's so cool.
they all think it's just them.
that maybe they're, like, going crazy or something, so they don't wanna admit it.
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?
no. It's real. It's really happening.
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?
something larger than themselves and they're not ready, are they...
...to hear it?
Yeah. But later they will.
so if you're gonna read it, I don't wanna spoil it.
what are you doing? Who you talking to?
I called my dad. It's a friend of his.
who? - Mr. Edens. You don't know him.
Hello? Hello? - Henry, it's after 11.
I gotta get off now.
no. Wait, wait. The book. I need the book. The title.
the book is Realm and Conquest.
realm and Conquest.
it's Book One, with the red cover. - Henry, give me the phone.
I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Thank... Thank... Thank... Thank you, Henry, thank you.
realm and Conquest. Thank you.
Karen? Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.
you're late. - I know.
I'm sorry, it was more complicated than we thought.
where is he? We've been here since 5: 30.
he's asleep. - Well, wake him up.
that's not gonna happen. We just got him sedated.
once he gets back on his regular medication...
...then it's just a matter of time.
have you seen the video? The tape? - I heard about it.
what happened after is worse.
this is in the parking lot, okay? People running for their cars.
he's there in his socks, nothing else.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I will not sit with this sickness any longer.
I cannot aid this sickness any longer.
what does this mean?
I'm not sure.
you've been with him the whole evening. What's he saying?
he wasn't really making much sense.
this is totally unacceptable.
this is a 3-billion-dollar class-action lawsuit.
in the morning, I have to call my board.
I have to tell them that the architect of our entire defense has been arrested...
...for running naked in a snowstorm, chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.
I understand.
what sickness is he talking about?
I don't know. It could be anything. - Well, give me one.
frostbite.
you think this is funny?
look, his wife was sick and she died last year.
his daughter doesn't talk to him. He's all alone. All he does is your case.
he skipped his pills. He had a bad day. That's it.
and you're somehow the authority on this?
his last episode was eight years ago. I was there.
I helped bring him home. I watched him get better. That's it.
come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy because of his low-key regularity...
...you hired him because he's a killer, because he's brilliant...
...because he's crazy enough to grind away on this case...
...for six years without a break. - We pay for his time.
I thought you wanted an explanation.
in the morning, I'm calling Marty Bach.
but, then, you know that. Thank you, Michael.
he was mostly just quiet.
I heard him moving around, I gave him a pill 15 minutes ago.
he took it? - A deal's a deal, right?
a super job, Elston.
you get to New York, you need tickets to the game or anything, you let me know.
I'll do that for sure.
did you see her?
who? - Anna.
no.
no, I didn't see her. She probably went back to the farm.
well, we need her.
Marty, even then, and the rest of them, they won't understand.
well, if anybody can explain it to them, it's you, Arthur.
no, they're lost.
they have what they want. - Let it go, man.
this what you wanted?
to be a janitor?
live like this? All this?
do what you do?
it can't be.
it's...
it's a burden, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
that's... That's how it feels.
well, I know that we've been summoned.
get some sleep.
Hello?
Yes. Hi, I'm looking for Verne?
you have a number?
don Jeffries gave me the number. He said I could call at any time.
no. The account number.
the code? I do. I have it right here. One moment.
excuse me one moment.
it's right here. 12-BKR-6.
am I speaking with Verne?
it's Mr. Verne.
Mr. Verne. I'm sorry, it's so late.
don said that I could...
I'm not exactly sure how this works.
do you have e-mail at your current location?
I do.
are you alone? - I am.
okay, I'm gonna upload you a little encryption package we like to use.
it's pretty self-explanatory.
okay. - Okay.
but you have to give me a minute to get to my desk. Hold on.
okay. Thank you.
what I was wondering is...
...I have an option on the lease for six more years.
I was wondering if there's any way I could lay that off.
is the lease worth anything?
eighty-nine hundred a month. It's...
the fixtures are gone, but there's...
but there's the bar, there's a kitchen, it's a great space.
but there's a...
Yeah, I understand. No, I understand.
okay, yeah, I will.
all right. Thanks.
come on, Arthur.
Arthur!
Arthur, open the door.
Arthur, open the door!
Arthur, open the goddamn door!
Arthur, op...!
open the fucking door!
Arthur!
goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking...!
Arthur?!
Mr. Verne, hey. - Hey, Danny.
you guys are early. I was pulling the other bags.
you can put them back. There's been a change of plans, sorry.
we ready? - Yep.
for chrissake.
don Jeffries signed this?
that's really his signature?
Where's the original?
we had a warehouse fire five years ago. We lost a number of documents.
what the hell is this doing in Arthur's bag?
well, I don't know, Marty.
that's something I was hoping you might be able to tell me.
what are we looking for?
if it says U/North, pull it aside. Anything that says U/North.
what a mess this is.
I want all this...
...everything here, I want it all packed up and sent up to the house.
any luck, Michael?
he booked a limo from Newark Airport at 3, got out at West Fourth Street...
...tipped the driver 100 bucks and walked away.
did you try his apartment?
he moved. - I know.
it's a loft. No doorman. I rang, nobody answered.
I called, I got the machine. - So he could be anywhere.
Arthur downtown is not a good idea. Some goddamn loft.
Where's his daughter? - I don't know. Spain, India.
Mars. She's crazier than he'll ever be.
Barry's taking over on U/North.
we got a lot of groveling to do.
you didn't exactly charm Karen Crowder.
I was punting.
you gotta saddle up here and get things under control.
saddle up?
he needs to be under a doctor's care. He needs to be admitted.
where? - Does that really matter?
Michael, U/North needs to know he's under control.
he's in a facility. They've been shook up. They need to be reassured.
it's not gonna be that easy. - Why the hell not?
because the laws in New York are pretty tough on involuntary commitment.
did you see this fucking tape?
I'm not arguing with you, Barry. I'm telling you how it is.
you know what, guys? We got 600 lawyers in this place.
why don't we find out which one knows about psychiatric-commitment statutes?
I can tell you that right now. It's Arthur.
I'm at the door. We're good to go.
Yeah, roger that. Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?
every five minutes, copy that.
Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.
if you wish to leave a message, please do so after the tone.
Arthur, pick up the phone.
Arthur, pick up the phone and talk to me.
no? Not gonna do it?
what happened yesterday morning, forget it. It doesn't matter.
someday you and I are gonna laugh about it.
but you gotta call me back.
you gotta call me back soon, Arthur.
I'll tell you what.
because you said it yourself. Part of this is definitely madness.
and there's a chemical part. We both know it.
but if you're willing to start with that...
... then I'm more than willing to meet you halfway and say, yes...
...this situation sucks. This case sucks. U/North sucks.
we can start with that. All right, Arthur? You hear me?
you're right about what we are.
I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying that your behavior is out of control.
but I'm telling you you're right.
you called it. We're janitors, I get it.
but we came to this, Arthur.
we made decisions. It didn't happen overnight.
you can't just suddenly stop and say, "That's it, game over. I'm into miracles."
Arthur. Come on.
goddamn it, pick up the phone and talk to me.
because whatever else you think is so important...
...you better let me help you, because I'm telling you...
...janitor to janitor, I don't see anybody else with a broom on the horizon.
it's me, buddy. I'm the...
mailbox is full. Your message cannot be recorded.
Hello? - Hello. Is Anna there?
hang on.
Anna!
where is she? Anna!
Anna! - Anna!
Anna, you've got a phone call!
where is she? Anna!
Hello?
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.
Hey. - Did you get some sleep?
I guess.
did you think about what we said?
Yeah. - You didn't tell anybody, did you?
no. My sister's spying on me, but that's normal.
Yeah. Because I meant what I said.
I know. I know. It's just...
...there's, like, 450 people in this lawsuit.
why are you choosing me?
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?
that's for sure.
I mean, does it...? Does it really matter?
I mean, isn't it what we wait for? To meet someone? And they're...
they're like a lens...
...and suddenly you're looking through them and everything changes...
...and nothing can ever be the same again.
who you talking to?
it's for me, okay? I get calls too.
that guy?
same guy. Same guy.
sorry.
no. That's... That's okay. My mother used to listen to my calls.
she can't believe I can do anything on my own.
well, that'll change.
I guess.
Yeah, but, see, that's something we can show her.
that you can do something.
that we could... We could do that together if you want. I mean...
I mean that I can help you do that.
I can get you 12,000 by Monday.
twelve's weak. Twelve looks bad.
how do you figure that?
they look at 75,000 and they look at you and they wonder what the problem is.
you say 12,000. That's gonna make people nervous.
this was the day before yesterday. Let me get my ducks in order.
what's the car worth?
it's a lease. It's the firm's.
so? You go to the bank. You've got the apartment. You refinance.
I can't. I did that three months ago.
are you back at the tables?
like I need that kind of action. I don't have enough going on.
I hope you're kidding.
if he finds out you're playing cards with his money, there's no dialogue after that.
do everyone a favor.
get out the treasure map and start digging.
you got a week.
Hey, Michael. How are you? - Hi, Cindy. I'm good.
come in. He's been on the phone all morning. What else is new?
I am trying to get him out in 15 minutes.
is he upstairs? - He's taken over the living room.
what are you guys doing? Get down here.
Soroyo, I told you to keep an eye on these kids, make sure they're downstairs.
Marty?
you know what he's doing? He's making their case.
I'm going through his files here, I'm reading this...
...he's building a case against U/North.
nobody's gonna let him do that. - Let him?
who the hell's gonna stop him?
you know what I just heard? He's calling these plaintiffs.
this woman from the deposition, he's calling these people now.
he's got these discovery documents. This is a fucking nightmare.
I tried him. Can't even leave a message. He's got the machine jammed up.
is that his briefcase? - Yeah.
Why? - We've been looking for it.
I don't know. It came up here with all the other stuff from his office.
you can't believe the crap he's got in here.
listen, Marty...
...I'm in a bind here.
I need a loan. I need 80 grand.
I thought you were done with that. - It's not that.
it's not the cards. It's none of that. It's the restaurant.
eighty thousand.
I'm sorry to jump you like this.
I've been trying to get a meeting with you for two weeks.
and I know about the merger, whether I'm supposed to or not.
there's nothing final on the merger.
well, that's why I'm asking you now. You're my meal ticket.
once you're out, it's me and Barry with strangers...
...and I'm trying to explain what I do.
everybody knows how valuable you are. Everybody who needs to know.
I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.
I've been riding shotgun for 12 years and I got no equity.
I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.
nobody told you to go into the bar business.
I only opened it so I'd have something else, a way out.
I had no idea you were so unhappy.
how many times did I ask you to put me back on a litigation team?
how many? - Anybody can go to court.
you think that's special?
I was good at it. - Wonderful. So are a lot of people.
at this, what you do, you're great.
for chrissakes, you got something everybody wants. You have a niche.
you made a place. You made a niche for yourself.
and if it's nostalgia..."You should've seen me when I was a DA back in Queens."
let me give you a serious piece of advice: Leave it there.
God forbid you're not as good as you remember. I've seen that happen too.
but I didn't come here for advice, did I?
so this is what? I give you the loan or you don't help out with Arthur?
I never said that. - No?
maybe you should have.
I don't know how you're gonna take care of this, but this, this is cancer.
this is something, we don't get it reined in and cleaned up soon...
...everything's vulnerable. Everything.
what are you telling me? - That I'm counting on you.
I'm telling you that by this time next week, Arthur will be under control...
...and everybody who needs to will have been reminded of your infinite value.
Jesus, Marty.
Hey.
when did you get so fucking delicate?
I'm late.
why don't you just call Uncle Gene and get the cops to help you?
it's not that kind of a problem.
how much longer are we doing this? - I don't know.
if he comes back to get his car, you call that number and let me know.
thank you very much. I appreciate it. - Okay. You're welcome.
if we're not gonna get to the movie, why don't you just say so?
what? - I wanna go home.
come on, Henry.
hold up!
stay in the car. Lock the door.
Arthur! Arthur!
wait up.
Michael. Jeez. You scared me.
making a delivery? - No, no, no.
very funny. No, nothing like that.
here, take one, please. Really. It's... It's still warm.
it's the best bread I ever tasted.
so welcome home.
I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.
I was beginning to feel a little overwhelmed.
but you're feeling better now? - Yeah.
much better, definitely. - Not enough to call me back.
well, I was trying to gather my thoughts...
...before I called you, and that's what I was doing.
and how's that going?
Yes, it's good, very good. I just...
well, I just need to make my thoughts a little bit more precise. That's...
that's my goal.
as good as this feels, you know where it goes.
no. No. You're wrong.
what makes this feel good is that I don't know where it goes.
how do I talk to you, Arthur? So you hear me?
like a child? Like a nut? Like everything's fine?
what's the secret? Because I need you to hear me.
well, I hear everything. - Then hear this.
you need help. Before this goes too far, you need help.
you got great cards here.
if you keep your clothes on, you can do any goddamn thing you want.
you want out, you're out. You wanna bake bread, go with God.
there's only one wrong answer in this whole goddamn pile...
...and you've got your arms around it.
well, I said I was sorry. - You thought the hotel was overwhelming?
you piss on this case, they'll cut you off at the knees.
I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm covering for you.
I'm telling them everything's fine. You're fine. Everybody's cool.
I'm out running this "price of genius" story to anybody who'll listen.
and then I wake up this morning and I hear you're calling this girl from Wisconsin...
...messing with documents and whatever else.
how can you know that? - They're gonna take everything.
your partnership, your equity. They're gonna pull your license.
how do you know I called Anna? - Marty told me.
well, how does he know? - I don't know. I don't give a shit!
you're tapping my phone. - Jesus, Arthur.
then explain it. Tell me how Marty knows!
because you're chasing a girl through a parking lot with your dick hanging out.
you think she didn't get off the phone and dial her attorney?
no. She wouldn't do that. I know that.
Really? You think your judgment is state-of-the-art right now?
they're putting everything on the table. You need to stop and think this through.
I'll help you think this through.
I'll find somebody to help you think it through.
don't do this. You're making it easy for them.
Michael, I have great affection for you.
you lead a very rich and interesting life, but you're a bagman, not an attorney.
if you wanted to have me committed...
...you should have kept me in Wisconsin, where the arrest report, the videotape...
...and eyewitness accounts of my inappropriate behavior...
...would have had jurisdictional relevance.
I have no criminal record in the state of New York.
and the single determining criterion for involuntary incarceration is danger.
is the defendant a danger to himself or others?
you think you got the horses for that?
well, good luck and God bless. But I tell you this:
the last place you want to see me is in court.
I'm not the enemy.
then who are you?
we find the seed.
we shape the soil.
we speed the harvest.
we feed the planet.
we find the seed.
we shape the soil.
we speed the harvest.
we feed the planet.
what the hell is he doing?
we find the seed.
you've reached the voicemail of Arthur Edens at Kenner, Bach and Ledeen.
please leave your message after the tone.
Yes!
here we are, all together. Is everyone listening?
this is the moment you've been waiting for. A very special piece of paper.
so let's have a big, paranoid, malignant round of applause...
... for United Northfield Culcitate Internal Research Memorandum 229.
june 19th, 1991.
conclusion:
the unanticipated market growth for Culcitate...
...By small farms in colder climates demands immediate cost-benefit analysis.
would you guys like a little bit of legal advice?
never let a scientist use the words "unanticipated..."
...and "immediate" in the same sentence.
okay? Okay.
in-house field studies have indicated...
... that small short-season farms dependent on well water for human consumption...
... are at risk for toxic particulate concentrations at levels...
...significant enough to cause serious human tissue damage.
well, this is a long way of saying that...
...you don't even have to leave your house to be killed by our product.
we'll pipe it into your kitchen sink.
... that it is tasteless, colorless and does not precipitate...
... has the potential to mask and intensify...
...these potentially lethal exposures.
now, I love this.
not only is this a great product...
...it is a superb cancer delivery system.
chemical modifications of the Culcitate product...
... the addition of a detector molecule, such as an odorant or colorant...
... would require a top-down redesign of the Culcitate manufacturing process.
these costs, while assumed to be significant...
... were not summarized here.
which, loosely translated, means:
it's going to cost a fortune to go back on this, and I'm just an asshole in a lab...
...so could someone else please make the decision?
clearly, the release of these internal research documents...
... would compromise the effective marketing of Culcitate...
...and must be kept within the protective confines...
...of United-Northfield's trade secret language.
you don't need me to tell you what that means.
goodbye.
it seemed to warrant my coming to... - Yes.
you have to contain this.
contain? - Right.
well, that's my question.
what are the...? What's the option that we're looking at?
along those lines.
you're talking about the paper, the data? I don't...
well, I'm wondering if there is some other option.
I mean something I'm not thinking of?
we deal in absolutes.
okay. I understand that. I do.
the material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer. We try, we do what we can.
well, the other way?
is the other way.
maybe you wanna bring Don in on this. - No.
this is nothing to do with Don. He's busy. This is nothing to do with Don.
do you think it's doable?
Yeah. We have some good ideas. You say move, we move.
if the ideas don't look so good, we back off, reassess...
okay.
is that, "Okay, you understand," or "Okay, proceed"?
are you 1? Are you 2? Are you 3?
are you 4? Are you 5? Are you 6?
are you 7? Are you 8? Are you 9? - Come on.
come, come on. Come on, I said. Hey!
come on.
go on, Dad, make a wish.
if I get what I wish for, it'll kill me.
you're a maniac. Unbelievable.
give me a hand, Eddie, huh?
all right, Eddie.
now, I did not make this myself and I don't wanna hear any complaints.
happy birthday.
you have time for cake?
Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.
you going in?
I'm late already. - Shit.
you're not both running out?
I got a situation.
you can't hang? - You're going in.
Yeah. I got a shift. - So do I.
come on, man. You haven't been up here in months.
if you go back now, Mickey, Henry's staying here.
good. You can drive him home.
just stay for an hour.
the girls did all this stuff.
he'll be asleep by then.
Timmy's been calling me.
he's afraid to talk to you.
he should be.
it closed out bad, right? - Is that what he told you?
the kids are freaking out.
the in-laws are freaking out.
Pammy can't stop crying long enough to start freaking out.
she took him back. - So what? Fuck her and the kids?
no. Fuck Timmy. And nothing's closed, okay?
I sold everything and we're still short. So don't talk about Pammy and the kids.
I got my hands full.
if it was you, he'd be in traction.
Yeah, he's sick, all right?
he's sick. It's a sickness. - There's a fresh perspective.
I've seen a lot of people falling off the wagon lately. It's going around.
is that pointed at me?
when do I see you? How do I know what you're up to?
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.
I haven't been in a card room in 10 months.
I gambled on the bar. I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.
that was my big play, all right?
I put up my walk-away money and it's gone and I'm scrambling.
okay. Okay.
cool down. I hear you.
I'd be pissed off too.
just hang for an hour.
okay? - Yeah.
ready? And, lift.
ready and go.
wipe.
you better hit it.
we're good.
okay, I found it. That's his number.
Dr. Mullien. See if you have any more luck.
if I can. As soon as I get a chance.
it's Medicaid. They're running us in circles. I can pull the file...
let him go, Steph. He's got a date.
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.
take a night off, Mickey. - You look tired.
I'm okay. See you soon. - Be good.
all right. Bye. - Bye, Hen.
Bye, Pop. - Bye.
uncle Timmy, hey! - How you doing, Henry?
Henry, get in the car.
good to see you, Hen.
what do you want? - I've been sober eight days now.
been back at the meetings. I wanted you to know.
in front of the kid?
Mickey, please. I know how bad I did, I swear.
I don't know how to make it right again. It's all I think about.
what do I do? I don't know what to do.
get Stephanie her tires back.
is he crying? - I don't know.
because of drugs, right?
that and everything else.
what?
your Uncle Timmy...
...and I mean this, on his best day, is never as tough as you.
I'm not talking about crying or the drugs or anything.
I'm talking about in his heart, in his heart. You understand me?
and all his charming bullshit, this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss bullshit...
...and I know you love him, and I know why.
but when you see him like that...
...you don't have to worry. That's not how it'll be for you.
you're not gonna be someone that goes through life...
...wondering why shit keeps falling out of the sky around them.
I know that. I know it.
okay?
I see it every time I look at you. I see it right now.
I don't know where you got it from, but you got it.
okay?
Hello?
the neighbors came by. They're renovating the loft downstairs.
they had water flooding from his bathroom down to their place.
his front door, fire escape, he had everything locked up pretty good.
it took our guys 10 minutes. They had to knock the thing down.
there's pills all over the place.
just the scene alone is pretty definitive for suicide.
then I spoke to some of your partners...
...who ran down these problems he'd been having lately, so...
is there a note? - No. They looked.
it could be an accident or he was gonna write a note and just messed up.
can I get in there?
his place? Not now. It's sealed.
once the seal goes up, it's frozen. We're gonna try and reach his daughter.
I guess she's off in Europe. But she's gotta come in.
or the M. E.'s gotta come back with a toxicology report.
that's a couple of weeks at least that it's gotta stay like that.
sorry.
sure.
okay.
I know your brother a little. My wife works the 190 out in Queens.
I'll tell him hello.
if something comes in, I'll get back to you.
Yeah. I appreciate it.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Michael. - Jeff.
this is tough.
Yeah, it is. He in here?
dumb son of a bitch.
what a thing.
hold on. - I don't even know...
I'm so sorry. - Yeah. All right.
I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.
that crazy goddamn bastard.
what a waste. What the hell was he thinking?
Marty? I gotta set this up.
go. Go.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
come on, let's get you a drink.
I just keep replaying all this back. Like, did I push him too hard?
not a chance.
I just couldn't get through to him.
what, you scared him to death? Come on. The man was a bull.
never happened. - Why does he fold, then? Why does he...?
it's gotta be an accident.
no, no. Arthur without a note?
he couldn't piss without leaving a memo. Has to be an accident.
I don't get that. I don't understand that either.
one minute he's gonna take on the whole world...
...and then 12 hours later, he's sucking down pills. Why?
Why?
because people are fucking incomprehensible. "Why"?
thirty years I know Arthur.
good years.
and what I feel right now, if I'm honest?
I can't even say, it's so awful.
you can say it.
we caught a lucky break.
we did, didn't we?
Marty? We need to get up to the office.
they accepted? - In principle.
don Jeffries wants us on the phone in half an hour.
I tried to explain about Arthur, but they're short on sympathy.
wait a minute. U/North is settling?
they see a window. They wanna try. It's their show. What are we gonna do?
you did what you could, Michael. We all did.
it's...
it's what we got.
you need a ride? - No, thanks, I'm fine.
hello.
hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.
who is this?
michael Clayton. I'm an attorney in New York. I got your number from Arthur.
you have got some nerve. - Excuse me?
you get her all the way to New York City and then leave her at the airport?
this is not a complicated person.
this is a girl who's never been farther than Milwaukee.
wait a minute. Now, wait. - No, you wait.
she's coming home tomorrow and when she does, if you call here again...
are you telling me she's in New York right now?
this is a young girl, do you hear me?
she's in the city right now?
what kind of people are you?
listen. You just stay on the phone one second. One second.
Anna.
Anna?
my name's Michael Clayton. I'm a friend of Arthur's.
I spoke with your sister. She told me you were here.
please open the door, Anna.
what are you thinking?
I don't know. I'll watch the door. You check his car. Let's get some details.
he didn't want to say exactly what it was.
just that when I got here, he would pick me up...
...and show me, and I would see...
...that it was something that would win the whole case.
even this morning...
...I mean, I thought:
okay, if I get to the airport and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.
okay, you're stupid, and you can go home now.
but it was there and he paid, like, 800 dollars...
...for a first-class ticket.
and I just...
I got on the plane.
I believed him.
you think maybe he was in some way disappointed?
let's say that he knew that you told somebody else about all of this...
...and, I don't know, in some crazy way, he was disappointed by that?
but I didn't. - You must have told somebody else.
no.
he made me promise.
you didn't tell anybody else about this? Not one other person?
no.
he really was crazy, wasn't he?
you talking about this? - Let me see.
you know what that is? - Yeah.
you said a favor. That's more than a favor.
well, nobody's gonna know where it came from.
are you that jammed up? - What are you talking about?
who asked for this? It's the restaurant, right?
one of these guys you owe? "Get me a seal.
you really wanna know?
this just gets better and better.
what are we doing?
Freeze!
right there, asshole! Don't move!
it's all right, I'm a friend! - Get your hands up!
get your hands up now! Now!
what's in your hand? - It's a book.
drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!
turn around. Slowly. - All right. All right. Okay.
who else is here? - Nobody.
I said, who else is here? - Nobody's here!
check in there.
you move, I'll take your head off.
now I owe this scumbag and his wife... Who's a complete piece of shit in my unit.
now I owe them both my balls. - I'm sorry.
you know I am. - "Nobody will know it's me."
you know what happens they don't bury this, that I gave you this?
it's bad. I know it.
I'm 18 months away from my 20. You just put my pension in jeopardy.
you made your point. - It's not a point!
who called 911? - What?
the building was empty. I was quiet. I wasn't there very long.
who called it in? Does that make sense to you...?
this never happened.
you got these cops thinking you're a lawyer.
you got these lawyers thinking you're a cop.
you got everybody fooled, don't you? Everybody but you.
you know exactly what you are.
we tried calling you six times.
but your machine must be busted or something.
we gave it our best shot.
we ran out of red covers. We only had 2000 in stock...
...so we did the other thousand in blue.
is everything all right?
it's fine, yeah.
you have a van or something? Because I have 25 boxes back there...
do me a favor. Hang on to them.
I'll come back and pick everything up next week.
Seriously? Thanks, man. - Yeah.
hello.
don. You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.
what?
do you know Michael Clayton?
Yeah, why?
we have a situation.
Hey, did they find you?
who? - Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.
Marty.
your phone's off. There's too much going on for your phone to be off.
I need a minute. - Yeah, well, we're late...
we never got to finish last night.
did you close the place? You look like hell.
no, I left right after you left. - If you say so.
we've been here all night. We had to make an announcement.
Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you. I had to pull the trigger.
I put Bob Nast and Kim, probably a mistake.
they're gonna pull together a memorial service by the end of the week.
I told them to call you if they need any help.
no, no, no. The other one. The other one.
so we cut you a check this morning.
there's some strings attached. And Barry...
there's no way around this, Barry's gonna have to be involved.
what if Arthur was on to something?
what do you mean? On to what?
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy? What if he was right?
right about what? That we're on the wrong side?
wrong side, wrong way, everything, all of it.
this is news? This case reeked from day one.
I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?
what would they do? What would they do if he went public?
what would they do? Are you fucking soft? They're doing it.
we don't straighten the settlement out in 24 hours...
...they're gonna withhold $9 million in fees.
then they'll pull out the video of Arthur doing his flashdance.
they'll sue us for legal malpractice.
except there won't be anything to win because the London merger will be dead...
...and we'll be selling off the goddamn furniture.
that's 80,000.
we're calling it a bonus.
three-year contract at your current numbers.
that's assuming this all works out.
you're doing this now?
look, I agreed to this, okay? But there's rules now.
you want the contract, you sign a confidentiality agreement.
it's gonna be bulletproof and retroactive.
because Marty's too nice to say it...
...but with all you know about this place, the clients and people who work here...
...it makes it a little weird when you ask for 80 grand.
if I was gonna shake anybody down, I'd come to you...
...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand. Is this him or you?
if I'm wrong, I apologize. - You're way the fuck wrong.
so there you go.
enough. Okay? Everybody.
he's an asshole, but he knows it.
and you're on the record. Okay? Everybody happy?
don Jeffries is here. - We're on the way.
call Bob Nast. Just see if they need help with this thing.
you're welcome.
you said 12,000. This is 75,000.
well, don't get too excited. You want a drink?
no. I'm working.
so we're square, then. No bad blood.
you're just doing your job.
that's right.
take it easy, Gabe.
Michael.
check.
check.
check. - Half the pot. Two hundred.
two hundred to go.
so, what happened with the bar?
you just had to be a rock star, huh?
what are you doing? You just got here.
guy plays nine hands, walks away.
I scare you away? What did I do? Did I scare you away?
get out.
get out of the car now.
Walter? - Michael.
Michael. Thank God you're there. - Yeah.
you have eight...
get out of the car.
tell him to stay off the phone. - All right. But you're on it?
am I clean?
just keep walking.
you copy. Am I clean?
just keep moving. He's walking to the car.
to let him know you're on the way. I'll get back to you with the details.
just give me two minutes. - I'll be in the car.
I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.
it's loose. I got a pulse. He's up there somewhere, but...
let's find a way to boost the signal.
I don't know what Walter promised you... - A miracle worker!
that's Walter on the phone, 20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?
I'm sending you a miracle worker.
well, he misspoke. - About what?
about the fact that you're the firm's fixer? Or that you're any good at it?
we're up. Just got a signal.
there's nothing back this way. What's he doing?
maybe he's lost.
wait a minute. - That's him.
he was alone, right?
Yeah, I think so. - Call it, yes or no?
we gotta turn around.
talk to me.
it's strobing.
no, we're good. I think we're good. Just keep going.
no, he turned. Somehow he turned.
where? - He took...
he took a left. - I don't have a left.
east. He's southeast. - What, so we missed it?
or the grid is wrong. - Hang on.
we gotta go back to one. - One is what? Where's our one?
half a mile straight ahead. Just keep driving. Just go.
it says we're closing. But that's west. It can't be west.
the signal or the grid?
it's both. It just keeps dropping out. - Goddamn it.
give me the cell.
our signal's good.
what?
Thanks, Mickey.
just get me out of here.
I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this, soon as we can. Thursday at the latest.
I think we should have someone from the equity group there. Maybe McDonnell...
yeah? - Did you hear?
Yeah, yeah. They closed U/North. - No. Michael Clayton.
what?
car bomb. Upstate. This morning. He was killed.
what?
holy shit.
it has been and it remains the U/North position...
... that this lawsuit is baseless and without merit.
our reluctance to negotiate was anchored by this belief...
...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand for settlement...
...in excess of 3 billion dollars.
the reason that we are all here today is...
...that several key elements in the case have changed.
you all have a tentative proposal packet...
... which outlines the details, but the bottom line is this:
over the past several months we had gotten word...
...that the plaintiffs were growing impatient...
...and were in the process of revising their settlement numbers.
we also learned...
... that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees were capped at 32 percent...
... up to 400 million dollars...
...above which, their fees dropped to 24 percent.
so we knew that there would be this motivational dead zone for them...
...in the middle there.
finally...
...our finance team informed us that they had run the numbers...
...and that the tax benefit...
...and within this fiscal year...
...that the write-off on this settlement would essentially pay for itself.
the package that you have before you represents, in my judgment...
... the strongest possible position for our company under the circumstances.
and, as chief counsel...
...it is my recommendation that this proposal be confirmed.
thank you, Karen. If you just give us a few minutes to talk about it.
certainly. I'll be right outside.
well...
how'd it go in there?
pretty freaky, huh?
did you see Arthur? He's wandering around here somewhere.
I'm kidding. Lighten up.
you got one of these? It's a great memo. It's an oldie but a goodie.
got your heart racing, don't I?
I don't know what it is you think you're doing.
what do you think I'm doing?
the suit's over. We have a deal.
whatever that is, it's meaningless at this point.
you think? I must have gotten it wrong. I thought you had a tentative proposal.
I didn't realize you'd signed all those checks.
that's a drag. I got a thousand of these. What am I gonna do with them?
I'm calling Marty.
good. Good. Do it. That's a great place to start.
let's find out who told him Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.
let's find out who tapped those phones.
this memorandum, even if it's authentic, which I doubt, I highly doubt...
I know what you did to Arthur. - It's protected. It belongs to U/North.
I know you killed him. - It's attorney-client privilege.
see, now, that's just not the way to go here, Karen.
for such a smart person, you really are lost, aren't you?
this conversation is over.
I'm not the guy that you kill. I'm the guy that you buy.
are you so fucking blind you don't even see what I am?
I'm the easiest part of your whole goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?
don't you know who I am? I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.
I do everything from shoplifting housewives to bent congressmen...
...and you're gonna kill me?
what do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.
you want a carry permit? You want a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?
I sold out Arthur for 80 grand and a contract and you're gonna kill me?
what do you want?
what do I want?
I want more.
I want out.
and with this, I want everything.
is there a number?
ten is a number.
ten? Ten what?
ten million?
where do you think I'm gonna get 10 million dollars?
you know what's great about this?
did you read it to the end? You see who signed it?
let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...
...if he wants to pass the hat for a worthy cause.
this would have to be a longer conversation...
...and would have to take place somewhere else.
where? My car?
all right.
I'm gonna make it easy. Let's make it 5.
five and I'll forget about Arthur.
five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something that we could talk about.
good. And then the other 5 is to forget about the 468 people...
...that you knocked off with your weed killer.
let me finish up this meeting. I'll talk to Don...
do I look like I'm negotiating?!
Karen?
one second. - Everything okay?
Yes.
ten million dollars. Bank of my choosing. Offshore. Immediately.
Yes. - Say it!
ten million dollars, your account, the moment this meeting is through.
Karen! Everyone's waiting. - I'm coming, Don.
you have a deal.
you're so fucked.
what?
you're fucked. - What do you mean?
take a wild guess. - Is there a problem?
I don't understand. - Let me get a picture while I'm at it.
you don't want the money? - Keep the money. You'll need it.
is this fellow bothering you?
am I bothering you?
Karen, I've got a board waiting in there. What the hell's going on? Who are you?
I'm Shiva, the god of death.
Ron! Ronny, I need security out here immediately.
all right. Here we go.
that guy right there, stop him. Grab that guy.
what are you doing? - We're detectives with the N. Y.P. D.
come back with us and we'll explain everything.
check on her. Make sure she doesn't need any medical attention.
you guys go into the ballroom. Nobody leaves.
have your guys cover every exit.
will you please explain to me what's going on here?
did you get all that?
Yeah. Got it.
you okay? - Yeah. Just gotta get some air.
sure.
welcome to "The Tom Dobbs Show." Please have your tickets ready for the ushers.
please turn off all cell phones and pagers.
take your seats, please. Tom Dobbs will speak to you before the show.
this story might fall under the heading of "one thing leads to another."
it started on August 20th.
at 7 p. m. Tom Dobbs, who had a successful cable show featuring political comedy, was talking to the audience during the warm-up routine prior to the taping of his show.
thanks for coming. This isn't the actual show. The cameras are pointing at nothing and some critics have said that too.
but I'm just here to talk to you, warm up the audience, a little bit of foreplay.
sorry.
I'll back up now for harassment reasons.
the government said recently... Well, a lot of people said that we're cutting back spending.
but NASA actually spent $28 million to develop a fountain pen to write upside down in space in zero gravity.
the Russians solved the same problem with five-cent pencil.
very easy, writes upside down, zero gravity. After two cases of vodka, still writing.
if you have the GPS, be very careful. I bought a Mercedes recently with the talking GPS.
up ahead, take a right. I opened the door and the car went, "Are you Jewish"?
but soon all of your appliances will talk to each other.
you'll get on the scale and the scale will go, "Psst! I've talked to the microwave."
I notice many of you with little cell phones. Soon they'll get so small they'll just be inside...
hold on, I got a call. Hello.
no, I'll make it louder. Hold on.
wait a minute, I'm taking a picture.
Oh, wait. I got mail.
it was during a Q and A that a woman made a statement.
Yes, ma'am. - Hi.
I feel so frustrated with the political system and my friends say the same thing all the time.
maybe you should run for President.
the comment was quickly forgotten and minutes later the show got under way.
senator, I think the public is pretty frustrated with the polarization of the parties and lack of accountability.
it's crazy. A woman tonight said I should run for President.
maybe I should.
within three hours there were four million emails endorsing Dobbs for President.
overthe course of the next week, Dobbs mentioned this four more times.
the internet was on fire.
over eight million emails.
it was a grass-roots movement fueled by the power of the internet and the cult of personality.
ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for your patience.
we have a great show for you tonight, so without any further ado...
on September 2nd something very, very unusual happens.
tomorrow I will officially announce my candidacy for President of the United States.
did you write that? Where's the punch line?
maybe it was sheer vanity, maybe it was a political stunt, or maybe it was because Tom believed his audience demanded it. Who knows?
as Tom Dobbs'manager I was as shocked as everyone around me and I wasn't exactly pleased.
does this mean I'm out of a job?
shortly thereafter, Tom Dobbs was on the ballot in 13 states.
that was part one of the unusual progression of events.
on the West Coast the second domino toppled over.
Voterconfusion...
endless recounts...
unreliable results...
democracy held hostage.
in today's AMerica, technology empowers the public in nearly everything they do.
and now, voting with confidence.
introducing the Delacroy voting system.
congress decided that Delacroy Systems would have the national franchise for computerized voting in the coming presidential election.
in hindsight, not one of their better decisions.
Forease of voting, speed and accuracy of vote.
it eliminates long lines and confusion at the polls.
it was of course a majorcoup forthis Silicon Valley-based company.
when the dubbed versions come in I need to see the contracts.
Delacroy.
as C. E.O. Of Delacroy, James Hemmings lovingly watched his stock rise.
in the bowels of the building, something else was about to take place.
I got the ballot from San Mateo so I thought I'd run my own election with the referendums, propositions and just add the candidates' names.
Why?
we've never run a configuration like this ballot, so I thought I'd give it a test drive.
Oh, God. I think I burned my lip.
it's like democracy on the head of a microchip.
Yes, but no matter how you slice it, it's what you're voting for and not how easy it is to vote.
whether she was being diligent in her work, whether she was obsessive-compulsive, or whether she didn't have a personal life, who knows?
but late that night she found something that seemed very wrong.
mills, I voted for you three times as much as I voted for President Kellogg.
why did the President win?
like a good, dedicated employee, she sent an email to C. E.O. James Hemmings.
she wrote that something was wrong.
she used phrases like "a glitch in the system," "compatibility problem," things like that.
Hemmings read the email and reacted as a C. E.O. Whose stock fortune was wrapped up in his newest enterprise.
if there really was a problem it was too late to correct it, so he ignored the memo and hoped the problem would go away.
I've read a lot of Op-Ed pieces recently saying that Tom Dobbs doesn't talk about the issues.
all right. I will address the issue.
the issue revolves around representation. The people of America are not being represented.
our political leaders are too indebted to special-interest groups and party politics.
this country was founded on the principle of government of the people, by the people, for the people.
we are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, we are the most powerful nation on this planet, and yet we can't educate our own children.
thought that went pretty well. - Lincoln got more laughs at the Gettysburg Address.
don't start.
everybody Loves Raymond is doing huge numbers in reruns.
comedy sells. Can we remember that? - I don't want to get into this.
I don't care what you say, but say it with humor. These crowds expect it.
you give speech after speech, nothing's funny.
they'll get funny when I'm back on the show. - It's too dry.
I came on the campaign to talk about issues.
there's no pop, zing. There's no oomph.
remember the motto "It's no joke?" It's no joke!
Tom, can't you do just two jokes of mine?
you're a comedian who talks about politics. So when you talk about politics without the comedy, it's like wanting to get laid and forgetting to bring along the woman.
you'll quickly discover something is missing.
we should have politicians who represent us and not special-interest groups.
whenever they want to distract you they use weapons of mass distraction
they bring up a constitutional amendment to ban burning of the flag.
by spending time in Congress talking about that, you deny otherthings - education, environmental issues...
I'm here to talk tonight about political commercials.
that's where most of the money goes in any political campaign.
politicians have to spend so much money just to buy TV time.
this is where the special-interest groups start.
when you have a political campaign that costs $200 million, you owe someone something somewhere down the line.
that's why I refuse to run television commercials.
just be entertaining. Look at it this way. Who would you rather have dinner with:
richard Pryor in his prime, or Kofi Annan, the head of the U. N?
tell me which dinner is gonna be more interesting.
if there's no candles, Richard.
but I'd like to be with Kofi just to say, "Coffee, Kofi"?
what? Coffee, Kofi? Kofi, coffee?
he's in the debate?
he's in the debate!
Tom Dobbs is gonna be in the debate! - What?
they're gonna let him participate in the debate. Have we struck gold or what!
Oh, my God! - We'll have to start writing.
we can write it, but is he gonna do any of it?
praise the internet! - 16 million emails spoke loud and clear!
the following is a quote from our debate advisory standards;
all candidates who demonstrate seriousness of purpose and significant support going into the final 30 days of an election "should be included in debates." Unquote.
Yes!
well, I fully agree with the debate committee's inclusion of Tom Dobbs.
he's by farthe strongest of the independents and I'm very much looking forward to the debate.
I'm more than confident of my decisions, my positions, and my relationship with the voting public.
and my hair.
Oh...
I think the first thing you gotta do is say you have unconfirmed information that the other candidates have had sex with farm animals.
it goes back to the Johnson thing.
president Johnson said he wanted to accuse his opponents of having sex with animals. OK?
his staffer said, "How can you prove that?
he said, "I can't, but I wanna hear them deny it.
seriousness of purpose. - The debate is gonna be a night full of pomposity.
the air will be full of bullshit. They'll be thanking everyone, do all those niceties.
they'll thank their wives, children, all their campaign supporters.
this is our night to shine, Tom. This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
it's like the comic who gets to play Carnegie Hall but shows up and plays the violin.
it's not what they go to see.
how many analogies do you have left?
how many does it take to make my point?
I didn't mean to yell.
you gotta cut loose. In this debate, get your show attitude in there.
Yeah, but may I reiterate?
they got me in because of my seriousness of purpose.
that's why we're in this debate. - Serious talk puts us to sleep.
you wanna talk about a serious issue, nowadays people tune out.
wait a second. Do you think anybody remembers the issues?
when there's a debate...
when was the last time any human being, any American, watched the debate and went:
Oh, God! Did you hear what he said? - "I believe he talked about fiscal policy."
Oh, my God! My eyes are open and I can hear again!
all they remember is Nixon sweating like Elizabeth Taylor after a Mexican meal.
that's not good.
I'm begging you, please. I'm like a man without water. An acerbic comment, would it kill you?
more and more people are watching your show, Jon Stewart, Bill Maher for news.
news from comedians. How crazy is that?
let's move on. Alison, Jenny, your thoughts.
I hope this doesn't sound silly, but the other two candidates are family men.
OK? And, Tom, with all due respect, how are you gonna come off as family-friendly?
well, I could hold my mother's ashes.
I know, we'd lose a certain amount of people there. But Chicago, the dead vote.
she's right, Tom. As soon as the program starts and we see the candidates' wives in their red suits...
you mean I have to get married before the debate?
campaign during the day, date at night. It's like some weird reality show.
it's not a bad idea really, is it? Part West Wing, part Bachelor. Hey, that's not bad.
here's our first contestant. Your name, please?
Yes, my name is Rachel Tensions.
Yes, indeed, dear. Contestant No. 2, your name?
my name is Miss Sogyny.
Yes, I thought he was really hot.
but when I found out about his radical environmental policy, I went, "Mm-mm."
I like a dirty environment, if you know what I mean.
I want a man who's not afraid to go in the wetlands and drill.
deep drill, you know? Get down in the mud and take it home, daddy. That's how I feel.
it's a piece-of-shit idea that could work.
Yeah, but you're running...
you're running because the people wanted you to run.
why do you think they wanted you to run? To listen to you talk about issues? Are you kidding me?
I can barely listen to you talk about issues. - Have I not said this a hundred times?
in Chicago I'm doing the same thing I've been doing. That's how I got here.
I wanna keep doing it because I sense that'll work.
you gotta go to makeup, Tom.
Menken.
look at this. - It's like the circus.
this is nuts. - When I was a kid, I was in the circus.
no. - Yes. I used to shave elephants.
you started in the tent, you're back in the tent.
I'm not kidding. They grow these big beards. In the wild they rub it on trees.
in the circus you shave them with a blowtorch.
one of those pump things with gasoline. You throw it all over their face.
you gonna have coffee?
because I need it to stay awake. - Do you have any green tea?
how long have you been smoking? - Since I was seven.
since you were seven.
my father was a big smoker.
while President Kellogg and Senator Mills have spent approximately $195 million apiece on the campaign for media advertising,
Tom Dobbs has not spent one cent.
he refuses to spend money on media, saying, "Candidates are not products."
here's the very latest. Dobbs is running at about 17% in the 13 states where he's on the ballot.
you want a beer or soda? - Soda, please.
...compared to a network show, he has been extremely influential in some smaller circles.
we got some clips. Are they ready? - I TiVo all his shows.
here's some excerpts.
swedish car maker Volvo has announced they are replacing air bags in their new sedans - with breast implants.
the numberof rear-end collisions has increased 95% in Sweden.
a lot of guys just like to bump their car and see what happens.
also Pope Benedict has mechanized the Swiss Guard and said, "It's my choice. I do it forthe Church and forthe Fatherland."
you know, I didn't mention this at the time when he was chosen Pope.
I was always hoping in my own heart for a Brazilian Pope - Pope Raul
just so you could have the nuns in the thong and the feathers.
I was thinking that would bring a lot of people back to the Church.
you've got really great skin. - Thank you.
a little bit of a tan. - Thanks. I went to a tanning salon.
I wanted to look like a Kennedy, but I think they set it on George Hamilton.
george Hamilton. Doesn't he have a grill? - No, that's George Foreman.
you wanna get married? I need a wife before the debate.
interested? - Uh... I don't know, Mr. Dobbs.
we could find a nice house on Pennsylvania Avenue, nothing ostentatious.
helicopter pad in the back, couple of thousand phone lines, staff of 60. Come on.
are you nervous?
why else would I propose to a woman I never met before?
but you have your own TV show. - But on the show I ask the questions.
you've got two minutes, Tom.
here we go.
good evening. Welcome to this last presidential debate between the major candidates for President of the United States.
the candidates are: the Democratic nominee, President Kellogg, the Republican nominee, Senator Mills, and forthe first time included in tonight's debate, the independent, Tom Dobbs.
my name is Faith Daniels and I'll be the moderator - for tonight's 90-minute debate which is coming... - Cute.
cleavage. Is that legal? - Very cute.
the format has been agreed to by representatives of both the Republican and Democratic campaigns.
there is no subject matterthat's restricted.
as always, each candidate will have up to two minutes to make a closing statement.
the order of those, as well as the formal questioning tonight, were decided in advance by drawing.
gentlemen, again, good evening and welcome. Let's begin.
Mr. Dobbs, how would you explain yourdecision to run for President of the United States?
I decided to run because I'm fed up with party politics.
I'm tired of the Republican Party and of the Democratic Party.
edgy! - There's no real difference.
it's a Mr. Potato candidate.
basically, you have a thing here where, here's the operative word; party.
behind closed doors, I think they just have a good time.
when you read the transcripts, some of the things your Secretary of Defense says, - I think there must be an open bar somewhere.
the bottom line is, they've lost track of what they're responsible for.
they're responsible to the people, not party loyalties
and definitely not lobbyists.
that's why I want to run for President. - Not punchy enough.
you have one minute remaining on yourtime. - Needs a little more flare.
can I get a refund? - We will continue.
senator Mills, I'd like to ask you the same question.
first of all, thank you, Faith. And thank all of you who are responsible for having us here.
I'd also like to thank my wife and children, who have been very supportive of my candidacy.
this guy smiles so much, it's upsetting me. - I thank all of those who made this possible.
and if I may reiterate some of the comments of Senator Mills with respect to family, children, wives and immediate family, and the enormously important role that they play in our failure or success
and in my case, success;
my love to them, my love to all of you who... - What?!
he's talking about his wife and children. - Why's he running on? Who cares?
thank you so much.
and that's why I have been a very rigorous advocate of tough security measures.
president Kellogg and I think alike in this area.
I am in total agreement, without equivocation, that security measures have got to remain tough.
- Thank you.
Mr. Dobbs, what would your position be on national security?
come on. - Tom, go for it.
do it. - Some of these measures are already tough.
if you've ever been through passport control, you stand in line with thousands of people, eventually you get to an immigration officer who takes your passport.
he looks at your passport picture, looks back at you, says, "Why did you have your haircut?" "I don't know."
they have a video camera that takes a picture and compares it to your previous picture.
they're very tough about that. They're very skeptical.
he's got to make his move. - More oomph!
meanwhile, at the southern borders of ourcountry, four million illegal aliens are crossing the border with bedroom sets and night tables.
hit 'em again! - And we're trying to reenterthe country legally!
they ask you tough questions like, "Where have you been? Why?"
you start to doubt yourself. "I forgot why I was there."
I guess it was pleasure. It was a vacation. I'm sorry, I took a vacation! I don't know why.
and then...
the next thing you know, they're patting down an 85-year-old lady in a walker.
listen, if there's an 85-year-old lady in a walker and she'a terrorist, - basically, game's over, folks.
and when they start to put on that rubberglove and look at me, I'm going, "OK..."
maybe we should have dinner first before we do this.
I'm saying let's have real security, not just the illusion of security...
Whoa! Yeah! - Oh, yeah! All right!
I... fully support hydrogen cars. - But you're backed by oil companies.
you'll have yourturn, Mr. Dobbs. - Sorry.
some of my colleagues and I in the Senate have come up with an interesting strategy...
if you're in bed with oil companies, you can't talk about fuel efficiency.
it's like being a kosher pig farmer. - He's getting angry.
this is not yourtalk show. - And you're not on your private plane, flying to the golf vacation you took with the heads of the majoroil corporations.
Wow. - It's like something I never saw before.
or did you fly in in that lovely helium plane? Oh, that's a blimp, I'm sorry.
no smoking in the hydrogen... Boom! Hindenburg!
Mr. Dobbs, please. - Of course he's for hydrogen.
it'll take 30 years to develop. Meanwhile, we haven't got any more fuel efficiency.
we're not exploring alternative fuels like methane - it's hard to hold that chicken over the gas tank.
or ethanol, which is basically fuel alcohol. - Mr. Dobbs...
if you get stopped by the police, say, "My car's been drinking, not me!"
or maybe helium, cause if you have a helium car...
if you have a helium car and you get rear-ended... "Hey, something's wrong!
- You have got to return to your podium.
can we get some order here? - You talk about responsibility!
your Treasury Department lost $28 million! - Please, return to your podium.
tell me that you are not receiving major campaign finance contributions from oil companies.
boom! - I don't take kindly to you calling me a liar.
if this is a debate, you should answer questions honestly.
you should be accountable for who you are.
the voters should know what you represent, and if you represent special-interest groups, we should be like NASCAR.
we'd be in the Senate with our suits on, and if you're backed by something, it'd be like little patches like they wear in NASCAR.
vioxx - the backaches end, the heart attacks begin.
put the big one on the back; "Enron - we take your money and run."
smack down!
it's all about accountability...
we have a format that we have agreed upon. May I remind you...
for God's sakes. We got some real trouble here. ...and the airlines...
faith, can you... Faith, can you hear me?
can you get control of this, please? Get control of this!
we deal in weapons of mass distraction. They push your buttons.
he's talking about hydrogen fuel. He wants an amendment to the Constitution on flag-burning.
it's an emotional issue! They talk about the desecration of the flag, but if you go online right now, you can buy flag underwear!
- Wow!
you can see an old lady wearing a flag thong and go, "Grandma, don't tell me where Old Glory is!"
it's all about distractions! - Mr. Dobbs...
no, no, Mr. Kellogg. Mr. Kellogg wants to pass an amendment against same-sex marriage!
anybody who's ever been married knows it's always the same sex!
Mr. Dobbs! - They don't know what to do.
what's up with that? - Mr. Dobbs!
it's a distraction! They point over here, they point over there - they want you not to know.
you don't want an amendment to the Constitution on burning the flag. Make it out of asbestos!
please do not make a mockery of this. - Let someone else speak, Mr. Dobbs.
return to your podium. - It was a mockery a long time before I came.
now we got applause. This is wonderful.
we're absolutely out of control.
$200 billion, you could buy a few books! - Mr. Dobbs!
it's hard to say how voters will react to Dobbs
either he's a hot dog or the genuine article.
he did make some issues come home to people, and if he could actually follow through, he may have scored points.
good point. But this wasn't just funny in the abstract, it was very pointed and very to the point.
he was making political points through his comedy, and it was incredible entertainment.
how good the politics is, we'll have to wait and see.
it's going to be difficult to assess how the American public will respond to the level of undisciplined behavior Tom Dobbs exhibited.
I'm feeling good. Almost euphoric. - Jack. Excuse me.
can you go see Tom right away? He thinks he screwed up.
Yeah, I'm euphoric, he thinks he screwed up!
who gives a shit what talking heads think? Different is good.
when I first saw you, I liked you because you were different, new.
you talked too fast - couldn't understand you half the time - but you were fresh.
these politicians today look like they're borrowed from the wax museum.
they're already in their suits, waiting to be buried.
you wanna be like them? Waste of time - you wanna be different.
all bets are off.
you're a good candidate, Tom - as loony as that seems - but...
what?
...you could be... an even better one.
are you all right?
what's wrong? - I'm just a little short of breath.
- Let's get you to the hospital.
it's his emphysema. He has a problem with the enlargement of his heart, but he's stable.
there seems to be a link between smoking and heart disease. Or am I just making that up?
lt'll be the first time I'll be in front of an audience without him.
you do what you did tonight and things could get really interesting.
the old bastard's right. Look at that. You gotta be different to make an impression.
I'm shaking it up there.
forget trying to be presidential. You end up looking like them - another stiff in a suit.
I gotta play my game.
they thought I was wild in the debate? Watch me in the next two weeks.
I'm back.
how do you answer the allegations that you were arrested for smoking marijuana?
I definitely was, yes. I did inhale, because I thought, "What the hell? I'll inhale it."
you're not denying these charges? - Not at all. I was 25, I was stoned.
do you think it'll affect the campaign? - You wanna know my history?
when I was a young boy, I used to look at pictures of naked ladies. Hence, my right hand is very strong.
at 17 years old, I beat up a guy.
when I was 21, I went to a prostitute. I was so bad, she gave me a refund.
I once had a blind date that I left in the theater. I felt so bad, I married her.
that's my ex-wife, who I am not on good terms with. I just farted a little while back there.
if you find any other nonsense you'd like to talk about, I'll be glad to discuss it.
ladies and gentlemen, it's now time for the campaign.
it's gonna be a whole new ball game, so brace yourselves, people.
are you tired of the Democratic Party?
are you tired of the Republican Party?
are you tired of a Congress that does nothing?
are you tired of having twice as many lobbyists as they've ever had before?
then I... I have an idea: Don't vote for the congressmen or senators.
you don't have to vote. Know how we're gonna pick 'em?
No! - The same way we pick a jury.
you'll get a more interesting cross section than the folks you got right now. I guarantee it.
do you want a better healthcare system?
you have an HMO that says, "We'll give you Viagra, but we won't pay for glasses."
you can have a hard-on, but you can't see where to put it.
we're gonna change it, aren't we? Yeah! - Yeah!
we're not just talking liberal or conservative - big-time change.
recently, a lot of the past administrations said it's unpatriotic to question the government.
if it was unpatriotic to question the government, we'd still be English!
the Boston Tea Party wasn't people going, "Oh, hello."
it was a lot of guys in Boston going, "Here's your tea, right here!"
I'm tired of the Democratic Party I'm tired of the Republican Party
we're talking about freedom of speech. And freedom of religion
practicing any religion you want, anytime, anywhere.
you could be Bewish - Jewish and Buddhist. You sit and you wait for things to go on sale.
we're talking about freedom of religion. Occasionally, religion crosses over.
you have people saying, "You must teach intelligent design."
look at the human body. Is it intelligent? I find it more interesting.
you have a waste-processing plant next to a recreation area.
they attack environmentalists: "You're a tree-hugger."
I go, "No, I've done more than hug a tree."
if you find the right naughty pine, you're gonna have a good night.
who's your woodsman? Who's your woodsman?
I'm not just a tree-hugger, I'm an air-breather. I'm sorry.
it's bad enough with the squirrels going... "Please help me. I can't breathe today."
if you put enough chemicals in the water, you'll be fishing, going: "I love catching two-headed bass."
they're good eating once you get past the tumors.
I'm tired of the Democratic Party Now I'm tired of the Republican Party
that's why we're here -'cause you want change! Yeah!
you wanna shake it up! You have to be eyes wide open, ready to move on!
arm in arm, hand in hand, everybody together, moving forward, because the future is now!
you're the greatest!
thank you. - You sure you don't want one of us to drive?
it's eight hours back to Chicago. - I just wanna be alone with my Barry White tapes.
uh, Tom, the doctors say that Jack's pretty weak, so he could doze off before all the results are in.
what's new? He used to do that during my act!
Hey, pick up a couple of cartons of cigarettes for Menken. They're cheaper on the road.
you're so thoughtful.
it's my middle name. - Compassion.
exit polls are very close.
kellogg and Mills are running about even, with Dobbs at around 17% of the vote.
as you can see, President Kellogg is winning by a small margin over Senator Mills in Rhode Island,
connecticut and Massachusetts.
but in all three states, the numbers are very close.
see the numbers? The computer glitch is happening the same way.
it looks as if Delaware now is going to President Kellogg by a very close margin.
what do you mean, it's not computing right? - Something's wrong.
an unusual turn of events in Virginia; with now 87% of the vote in, comedian Tom Dobbs is leading.
that will surprise more than a few of the experts.
the Dobbs numbers have been increasing since the last debate.
most of the polls had him with 10 to 11%.
so, if this vote holds true in Virginia,
Dobbs is going to surprise a lot of people.
Ding-dong!
ready for your pina colonic? - What are you doing here?
thought I'd spend the evening with someone who gets on my nerves.
how about Virginia? - Virginia's OK, but Debbie... Such a slut!
a little intensive care package here. Red wine.
a good month. - Yes.
OK. A little cheese and pate - always good after a heart attack.
sit.
comedian Tom Dobbs has won New Jersey as well as Virginia, a blue and a red state, which indicates that his message cuts across political lines.
it's gonna be interesting.
you're not gonna win this election, but at least you didn't go gently into the good night.
from all the signs tonight, that Delacroy voting system has worked extremely well.
we're not hearing anything about long lines at the booths orother snafus.
it seems that this has probably straightened out some of those voting problems of the past.
excuse me. - Hey, Eleanor.
have you looked at these numbers? - Yeah. Yeah.
I emailed you. I told you I thought there was something wrong with the system.
I was told the glitch was limited to my computer. - Yeah.
what? Are you calling me a liar?
no. All I'm saying is, these numbers, these results, this is what I mentioned to you in my email.
why did you decide to test the system? - I don't know.
why'd you need to run a test at such a high count? - I don't know.
if you found a system error, how were we gonna fix it?
I'm not sure. - Look into your soul and ask yourself this:
why would you test the computer at such limits with so few days left to fix a problem if you found one?
I... was just double-checking.
do you want to destroy this company? Because that's what you may do.
you understand the ramifications. Do you want to put over 1, 000 employees out of work?
do ya? - But the election will be a fraud.
here it is: The people are voting, there is an election, the democratic process is working.
the only sour note? They won't end up with the person that they voted for to be the President.
but we can celebrate the process. The democratic process which we hold so dear will have worked.
everybody's gonna be satisfied.
unless somebody discloses indiscriminately, willy-nilly.
it will appear democracy is in the shithouse, and by tomorrow Delacroy will be nonexistent.
now, was that your motive? - No.
america votes, a leader is chosen.
but one thing could disturb this beatific vision.
I... I just want to be truthful.
perception of legitimacy is more important than legitimacy itself. That's the greater truth.
don't fuck with our democracy. Don't undermine our way of life.
every American believes their vote counts. Now you wanna tell them that's not true?
but the results of the election will be wrong! One candidate will win because of computer error.
how do we know that? - I'm telling you!
based on what? Guessing. Listen, this is your project, Eleanor.
if you wanna tinker with it for a future election, it's not only your prerogative, I encourage you.
the Delacroy voting system is your baby. You're a perfectionist and you wanna make it more perfect, but do it alone and with an eye to the future, because it is the future that interests us.
now is the past.
as I understand it, there's no problem.
And?
and...
I tell you, they seem to like this guy Dobbs. - Oh, Danny, please.
so this is all part of the same computer error? - Yes.
I'm going home.
well, I don't know if she's enrolled in the program, I'll tell you that.
what does my legal counsel suggest, then?
I'm gonna make a phone call.
there was some research done saying more and more people are getting their political news from Leno, Letterman, Jon Stewart, Tom Dobbs and Bill Maher more than from newspapers and actual news programs.
there you go. My thoughts exactly.
you're kidding me? Aw, come on!
it should be on the news any minute. It looks like we're gonna take North Carolina!
what? And Indiana? You're sure?
Oh, this is so insane. Insanity, it's sweet insanity!
and Indiana goes to Dobbs.
it's just been confirmed that comedian Tom Dobbs has won Arizona.
if I'm correct, comedian Tom Dobbs has won every state where he's been on the ballot.
comedian Tom Dobbs wins the Sunshine State.
so New York wants a comedian as President.
comedian Tom Dobbs... Another big win for Dobbs.
with 99% of the vote in, comedian Tom Dobbs has won Texas.
the funnyman has conquered the Lone Star State.
according to my calculations, comedian Tom Dobbs has got 146 electoral votes right now. He's got 'em.
there are five more states to be counted where he's on the ballot, out of the 13 to be counted.
and it's possible, if he takes all five states, that could put Dobbs overthe top of the 270 needed.
I believe I've got my figures correct, but it's a possibility - not a likely possibility, but it's a possibility.
this is the happiest night of my life...
and I can't stay awake.
our exit polls have only in some cases proven accurate.
perhaps voters are keeping their voting choices...
...close to the vest.
now, Senator Mills has very strong numbers, but not strong enough to beat President Kellogg.
in fact, the incumbent has beaten Senator Mills in every state where they've been going one-on-one.
...they are still confident of an election victory.
Tom Dobbs has been gaining momentum since the debate.
now, right afterthe debate, there was a mixed reaction, but what we've seen since then is that the public apparently sees him as a candidate forchange.
he has been formidable, as we've seen in these numbers...
we are now going to go live back to Election Central, where Chris Matthews is standing by. Chris?
hold on to your hats, folks.
Tom Dobbs...
comedian Tom Dobbs is the next President of the United States.
at 01:23 East Coast time, comedian Tom Dobbs has been elected President of the United States.
the free world will now be led by a comedian.
Mr. President? Donald Tilson, Secret Service. I'll be taking over.
you don't find this a little bit absurd?
thanks for your honesty.
always been a big fan of your work, sir.
Jack, you're the manager of the President of the United States.
comedy Store to the White House.
we must look into computer fraud.
I mean, we've had problems in other states - Florida, Ohio, elsewhere
where it's not only questions of malfunction but also questions of legitimacy.
are these computers hackable?
there isn't a paper trail. It's not the way the Delacroy system is set up. Congress knew that.
let's face it, the reality is a comedian was elected President of the United States.
case closed, end of discussion.
any thoughts as to the make up of your cabinet?
I looked at the IKEA catalog and didn't see anything I liked, but I'm hoping for a dark walnut with a nice veneer. That'd be lovely.
what was your vice president's response?
shocked as the rest of us. " Guess I'll have to clear my calendar for the next four years."
can we get back to questions of the cabinet? - Certainly.
it will be diverse and include Republicans and Democrats and people of no party affiliation. I want diversity.
I believe democracy is a collision of ideas. I'm not of the school that if you're not for us you're against us.
that being said, if I had my druthers, I'd love an all-lesbian cabinet.
it'd be fun to think about what they're doing behind closed doors.
thank you, everyone. We're on our way to Washington. Wish us luck.
it'll be an adventure, and you're all part of it.
Hello? - Hey, Ellie. Sorry, I didn't see you there.
well, maybe if you paid a little more attention instead of daydreaming.
sorry. Just give me a cappuccino, please. - Sure.
Hey, Angus. Cappuccino. - Can't you see he's busy getting mine right now?
I was just giving him my order. It's not a big deal. - It's not a big deal.
well, apparently it is, 'cause this is taking forever.
it's forever. - Hold your horses.
Hey, Angus, do you have any of those cookies I like? - God, can you please just let me get my cappuccino?
OK.
didn't realize you were such a bitch.
anytime during this millennium would be terrific.
Thanks.
cappuccino? - Yes. Thanks.
Oh! Ow. Ow.
Oh... shit.
shit. Shit.
let me give you a hand. - I got it.
just let me take care of it for you. - I got it. I got it!
it's no... - I got it!
I got it.
OK.
I got it. I got it. I got it.
who stole my purse? - Ellie. Ellie, it's right here.
did you empty out my purse?
did you touch my things? - No!
you touched my things.
I can't believe you touched my things. - Ellie, I didn't...
you touched my things. What is wrong with you?
he went through my things!
dammit.
I made a mess. I've made a mess.
I've made such a mess. I've made such a mess.
but it's my mess! It's my mess and I'll clean it up. - OK.
I'm gonna clean up my mess.
it's my mess. It's my mess.
Ellie? Do you want me to get some help?
my mess. - Can someone call 911?
we have a deadline. In terms of appointments, there are roughly 7-8, 000 slots to be filled, 1500 of which will require Senate confirmation.
7-8, 000? Do we know that many incompetent people?
well, in LA, maybe.
Oh, and over 400 just for core White House staff.
we have to announce 14 cabinet secretary positions, or at least float some of your possible choices.
well, just off the top of my head, I was thinking Bruce Springsteen as Secretary of State.
joke. - Little one. Little joke.
sorry. I'm just a little nervous, guys. I do care.
phew, hope this works.
Oh, it'll work. I think.
thank you. Sorry I'm late - my horse pulled up lame.
thank you. Nice tie.
president-elect Tom Dobbs paid an impromptu visit to Congress and, literally, brought down the House with laughter.
as word spread quickly, more and more members of Congress left theiroffices to see Dobbs'costumed visit firsthand.
that reception was extraordinary. I will try and be brief, 'cause I know Tuesday's bingo day in Congress.
it should be duly noted, Chairman, that this not a scheduled visit, it is not on the docket fortoday, it's not really official, so no rules have been violated, it's just our little secret - between you, me and the world media.
I also have some disturbing news.
I took a poll, and one third of Congressmen and women thought this was still the present fashion.
Otherthird thought I looked like former first lady Barbara Bush...
I'm looking at the toxology report. It's overwhelming.
she's got Benzedrine, morphine, codeine, cocaine, GHB, Talwin.
historians have written that our founding fathers were brilliant and courageous men, but they sometimes made difficult decisions, sometimes had to pass unpopular legislation.
what will they think about us 200-and-some years from now? What will they write about this Congress?
will they say that you're brave and brilliant? Courageous?
will your legacy be as extraordinary as theirs?
we have a lot to live up to.
I think we can do it. I know we can do it.
you can't just say it didn't happen.
when have you ever known me to ever take any kind of drugs?
I'm even afraid of NyQuil.
I got a promotion. They're sending me to Ireland.
Oh, Danny. - What?
they're just trying to pay you off.
they just don't want you talking about the computer problems.
gotta let people know the election's a fraud.
do you think anybody'll believe you? - Sure. Why not?
maybe because you flipped out and you're in a hospital and you've been doing drugs?
I don't do drugs. - Cocaine...
I don't do drugs. I don't do drugs. I don't.
who believes you? Who's gonna believe you?
...innercities, infrastructure, environmental issues - that's what's before us.
he will.
turn left.
OK.
talk to me, baby, talk to me. - Drive 0. 4 miles, then turn left.
OK.
I am now the manager of the president-elect of the United States.
15% of the President's salary is nothing compared to what Dobbs normally makes on a yearly basis.
this is a monetary sacrifice I am willing to make since I am now the first show business manager ever to handle a president.
Oh, I wish I could walk.
Oh, man.
happy birthday, Mr. Menken.
Eleanor Green, FBI.
Hi. Eleanor Green, FBI.
everything all right? - Oh, just fine.
just fine.
I'm just here just making sure everything's secured.
I probably shouldn't have introduced myself. I'm sorry.
no, you have to.
anyway, happy birthday again. - Again? Did another year just pass?
I taught Tom everything he knows about comedy. - Except how to be funny.
I can see that. - A put-down from the FBI.
no, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it...
please. It's all right. He's only annoying when he's happy.
it's an old Irish tradition.
you wanna dance? - I don't dance.
they didn't teach you to dance at the FBI? J. Edgar Hoover was a wonderful dancer.
fat, but light on his feet.
could we just talk and not move?
sure.
so, what do you do when you're not pretending to be an FBI agent?
it's that apparent? - Yeah.
you're not concerned? Me crashing the party?
please. I've played in clubs for years.
had to deal with drunks, hecklers, and angry waitresses, one of which is my ex-wife.
I have an eye for that and you wouldn't be on my dangerous list.
good. That's good.
too fast? - No, I'm fine.
so, what do you really do?
um...
well, I-I did work for Delacroy Voting Systems.
but they had... cutbacks.
I... Laid off.
laid off? I thought they were making the big bucks. That's weird.
well, it was a small cutback, actually.
it was a very small cutback, actually. Just me.
Oh, so would "fired" be more appropriate than "cutback"?
well, if you wanna be picky... - Oh, picky with words, then yes, then I guess fired...
fired would be it.
may I ask why?
Oh, none of my business. - It is.
look, you're having such a good time. I don't wanna spoil it.
you have to do the birthday toast now.
OK, I'll be right there. Yeah.
listen. We're staffing up right now and...
staffing up? - Yeah.
Tom. 60 seconds. OK.
Oh, staffing up? No, that's not what I meant. - OK.
that's not why I'm here. - That's all right. This is my personal cell.
and, you know, if you need anything, you call. OK?
Yeah! Yes, indeed!
to Jack Menken, a man who once said:
if Mama Cass had shared a sandwich with Karen Carpenter, they both would be alive today.
I... I'm sorry.
he's so sensitive, someone once asked, "What do you think of gay marriage?
and he said, " I think gays have a right to be just as miserable as the rest of us.
to Jack Menken, an incredible human being.
a great manager. - A great manager.
made you a star. - Mm-hm.
made you the President, and by doing so has put me out of work.
God bless him. God bless Jack Menken!
Danny, hi. - Hey. Where the hell are you?
are you alone? This is yourcell phone?
Yeah, why? What's going on? - Paranoid, I guess.
I got a chance to meet him. Dobbs.
you didn't tell him, did you? I mean...
no, but he should know, don't you think?
let it go. Nothing good can possibly come from revealing what happened.
is anyone trying to figure out what happened with the system?
I don't know. You know, it's not the sort of thing that I'd hear about.
they'd be going through the private channels for that sort of thing. You know how that goes.
Ellie?
good night, Danny.
James Hemmings' office. - Yes, is Mr Hemmings in? This is Tom Dobbs.
just a minute. - Mm-hm?
it's a Tom Dobbs. Is that the Tom Dobbs, President-Elect Dobbs?
well, did you ask? - No. I was too embarrassed to.
all right.
James Hemmings. - James. Tom Dobbs, president-elect.
uh... yes, sir. Yes, of course.
I know this is a little out of the ordinary, but did you have an employee named Eleanor Green?
uh, yeah. Um... Is something wrong?
I need some information. Strictly confidential, just between you and me.
Yeah, well... I mean, well, you know, where do I begin?
I know that she was fired by Delacroy.
Mm. Uh, look, I'm a little confused. Is she...
is she applying for a job with you? - No.
did you meet with her personally?
Yes. That's how I knew that she was a Delacroy employee and that she was fired.
Yeah. Yeah. Did she add to that? - Add what?
did she mention that she had a bad drug problem? She had a breakdown here.
she had to be hospitalized. - No, she didn't mention that.
I'm surprised she's there. She should be in drug rehab.
that's weird. She doesn't seem like the type.
do you know how I might reach her?
I guess we both have a problem in that area. - Yeah. Yeah.
look, if I hear anything I'll contact you.
Delacroy Systems has completed a deal with the European Common Market which will invest in theircomputer voting system.
with this announcement, Delacroy stock hasjumped 37% on the Big Board.
come on!
Yeah, there are two of them. - All right.
Yeah, two N's. That'll get you on the board with $1800.
Yeah, there are two of them. Got almost $3, 000 in that kitty.
I'd like to buy a vowel. I'd like to buy an I.
well, there are two I's.
it'd be a good time to find a letter or two. - M.
or three. Yes.
double G's before double L's.
double B's before double G's.
Yes! Yes!
double G's before double L's.
double B's before double G's.
it's alphabetical.
it's alphabetical.
OK. You mean to tell me that we didn't shut down her access when we let her go?
evidently not. - That's smart.
her ID's showing up in the log. She's been in the mainframe, poking around the code depository.
do we know where she is? - Not yet, but we will.
what's the matter? - You know. I'm unhappy.
you're unhappy about what?
what do you think I'm unhappy about? - You agreed to play the turkey.
I never agreed. - It's not a big deal. All you do is cluck.
first of all, we don't cluck, we gobble, OK? And if it's not such a big deal, why don't you be the turkey?
you want me to be the turkey? - Yeah, come on.
you want me to be the turkey? - Yeah.
Tom here.
Hi. - Eleanor, is that you?
Yes. - How do you turn the music down?
we're having a little post-Thanksgiving outing. Can I pick you up?
an outing? No, I-I had something I had to tell you.
good, good. Give me an address.
Eleanor! We're going paintballing.
I brought you some camouflage and thermals 'cause it's gonna be cold up there. Follow me, men.
what? - Cold.
I can't believe it.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
are you all right? - No!
I'm out. - Well, thank God.
I'm out of ammo!
the president-elect's just been shot.
he's dead. Let's go round them up.
what a pleasant way to spend the day, huh? Killing your friends?
that's all the exercise I'm ever gonna need.
did that hurt? - Yeah. Yeah.
Hey.
Tom, could I talk to you for a minute?
sure. We have to walk away from those who have listening devices.
um... do they have listening devices?
no, they can't hear. Well, they hear each other, but not us.
OK.
um...
because I haven't been...
uh...
I haven't been forthright with you about certain things.
maybe "forthright..."God.
forthright isn't the word I'm looking for.
maybe I haven't disclosed enough, and that really isn't easy for me, especially now that I know you...
I mean, OK, I don't know you. I mean, I know you...
no, I know you because you're Tom Dobbs, I know you, but I don't really know you...
you got a lot of setup here. You don't need that much.
it's too much of a lead-in. Just the punch line.
you're going to be President of the United States. - Yeah.
maybe that's not so bad. - I hope.
Oh, God. Oh, God. I worked at Delacroy and I worked so hard, and I cared.
I cared so much, and I am so full of guilt.
I can make this a lot easier for you.
what do you mean? How?
well, I called Hemmings at Delacroy. - What?
Yeah. Well, you know, I wanted to find you. I remember you said you worked at Delacroy.
I wanted to see you.
you did? - Mm-hm.
you wanted to see me. - Yeah.
Wow.
God. That's good. - Well, good. Well, good, not so good.
no, it's good. - Well, he told me about your drug problem and...
Oh, no. No, no, no. I don't have a drug problem.
it's all right. - Tom, I do not have a drug problem.
it doesn't bother me. - I hate to interrupt, but the Secret Service wants you outta here by dark.
by the way, drug dealers have this place booked until dawn.
I didn't tell him. He's just making a joke. We'll talk about it later, honestly. It's OK.
there's no drug problem. - That's all I need to know.
there's a lot to discuss here. - Yeah. I think...
that just doesn't look clear to me. Another 30 minutes?
Yeah, maybe. - The wing is...
whoa, whoa, wait a minute. We may have a problem here.
I like it crispy. I like a nice crunchy skin. - I know, Menken. I know you do.
just wanna make myself heard. - Uh-huh.
I'm a producer. I've produced a lot of turkeys. - Yes, you have.
look at this old C-SPAN. Congress is in session and no one's there.
Harkin's speaking about an amendment to a budget bill. It's empty.
how do you get people in their seats? It's crazy.
they have things to do. - Like?
like, hello, they've got lobbyists to deal with. They've got trips the lobbyists have sent them on.
they've gotta go do TV shows to explain to people what they're not doing while they're not there.
this makes golf look like porn.
shouldn't you be giving that up?
did you know there were once ads that said four out of five doctors recommend this brand or that brand?
come on. You're kidding me.
doctors used to recommend cigarettes? - Said they were good for you.
there was one slogan before my time:
not a cough in the carload.
it's a little too late now.
I'm sorry.
you like our Tom Dobbs, do you?
unfortunately, I do.
I see that.
I have to talk to you in private. - Now?
Yes. - OK.
Thanks.
you've got a great group.
Ellie, whatever your problem is...
what? You can fix my problem?
is this the president-elect speaking or just Tom Dobbs the comedian?
just Tom Dobbs. - Good.
because Tom Dobbs is not the elected President of the United States. There. I've said it. Kill me.
it's true.
there was a problem with the computer voting system.
I tried to warn them. It's that error that's made you the next President of the United States.
I didn't win? - Not even close.
what do you want me to do? - I don't know.
I had to say it. I've been living with this. I just had to tell you.
do you want to go public with this? - I can't.
I could, but nobody would believe me. Not anymore.
but somebody has to know. Somebody. At least you.
I mean, I don't know. Look, I don't know.
maybe it is best that you're the next President of the United States even if they didn't vote for you.
out of curiosity...
did you vote for me? - No.
I don't vote. To be honest with you, I don't vote.
politicians will say anything in the world to get elected. Maybe I'm jaded.
honestly, I didn't even think you had a chance.
I know it's ironic I'm talking like I'm concerned. I don't even vote.
I'm gonna talk this over with Menken. Come on, I want you with me. Come with me.
no, I can't. - Why not?
Tom, I can't! - Why?
I had to tell you. You do with it what you want.
happy Thanksgiving.
happy Thanksgiving.
is something wrong?
you guys have a fight?
she knows a lot about computers. More than you ever wanna know, really.
should I be impressed?
it's improbable, I winning the election.
well, Mark Twain once wrote, "The only difference between reality and fiction "is that fiction needs to be credible.
we are, my friend, in uncharted waters.
she just told me I didn't win the election.
Whoops.
computer malfunction.
she knows this? For sure? - Yeah.
she tried to warn the Delacroy Company and they hid it. Bad for business.
you don't believe her, do you? - I do. It's true.
I always thought the TV Nielsen ratings were full of shit, but this?
it's hard to believe that many people watched JAG.
I never met anybody who'd say, "Hey, did you see JAG last night?
don't believe her so quickly, Tom.
she knows what she's talking about. - That's debatable.
so... what's she gonna do?
nothing. She left it up to me.
leaving it to you. Well, Delacroy's not gonna say anything, and she's not gonna say anything, so...
there's no problem.
no problem? - We move on.
Oh, like nothing happened? - Something like that.
if you tell a joke and it stinks but you put a laugh track over it, the joke still stinks.
I'm President, but not really.
this is where we are. You wanna throw it away or go for it?
I never told you which gigs to take, I only advised, but to me this decision is a slam dunk.
Yeah.
Tom?
Eleanor, tomorrow at 11 o'clock I'm gonna have a press conference and tell the American people that I'm not the legitimate President of the United States.
I'm so sorry.
I-I'll call you tomorrow, OK?
Danny, I told him.
why did you tell him?
I had to. And now I hate myself.
does he believe you?
he's calling a press conference at 11 tomorrow. He's gonna make the whole thing known.
Oh, shit. Look what you did.
I wish I hadn't told him.
I mean, I know I did the right thing. I know I did the right thing. It was the right thing to do.
and yet... And yet...
M-m-maybe I've done the wrong thing, and how can that possibly be?
I mean, did I do the right thing ordid I do the wrong thing?
I know it's the right thing to do, so why do I feel like this?
we've got to preempt his press conference.
and very early tomorrow morning.
press conference set up? - Uh, yeah. What the hell's going on?
OK.
Jack? Jack?
got a reporter says Delacroy's going to make a major announcement.
some big story, something to do with Eleanor Green.
this is what we got going on today.
they're called the Witches of November. A storm from the Great Lakes.
that's going to spread one to three inches of snow right across the D. C. Area.
I don't think there's any more than that, not a lot of moisture here.
it's a pretty closed-up system, and it's gonna move up quickly...
we interrupt this broadcast to bring you this breaking news.
we have some dirty laundry that needs to be addressed.
recently Delacroy had to dismiss an employee, Eleanor Green, who was suffering severe psychological problems. We made an effort to get her medical help, and subsequently discovered that she was heavily involved in the use of barbiturates and cocaine.
we would have kept this private, but additional facts concerning Miss Green have come to light.
we have evidence that Miss Green manipulated the prototype of ourcomputer voting system.
Tom here. - Turn on the television.
what channel? - Any channel.
her motives aren't quite clearto us, apart from the fact that she seemed obsessed with Tom Dobbs, to the degree that she actually tried to corrupt the computer system to get him elected.
we also know that the president-elect has been seen in her presence recently, but let me make this clear- we are not suggesting any impropriety on behalf of the president-elect.
pull over. - We are a family at Delacroy.
we have an extensive healthcare program.
lots of people have psychological problems, mental problems, health problems of one kind or another.
it's not something you sweep under the rug, you gotta talk about it.
we believe that strongly, and we make our best effort to find out about it as soon as possible and give help.
the good news is, all the computer voting systems installed in polling stations remained secure.
therefore, there were no irregularities in the election and our safeguards proved to be impenetrable.
and that's all the information that we have at this time. I'll take any questions now, if you got 'em. Yes?
take a look at this. Take a look at this. Perfect, just perfect.
she's a piece of work, huh? Flipped out in the company cafeteria, on all sorts of drugs.
clearly a mental case. Hospital said she had more pills in her than a pharmacy.
I believe her.
she didn't seem that crazy.
you're in love with her. She could tell you Gandhi ate hot dogs and you'd believe her. Take a look at this.
if what she says is true, I'm really not the president-elect.
"if" is becoming a very large word.
did you forget the first time we met her, she said she was working for the FBI?
she said she knew about the computer fraud, but takes three weeks to tell you.
by the way, you're not the President. Happy Thanksgiving.
if she's not psychotic she's a stalker, and if she's not a stalker she's a CIA operative.
or maybe, just maybe, she's a succubus. - What's that?
a succubus is some sort of a demon that sucks the life out of healthy men.
I was once a healthy man.
what are you talking about? Please, please stop.
don't get off track.
can I get change for this, please? My dollar won't work in your machine.
you're that Miss Green from the television.
I wasn't sure, 'cause you always pay cash.
did your uncle get ahold of you? - What?
your uncle. He was trying to call your room. He said he couldn't get through.
by the way, that machine doesn't work.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I'm in her hotel now.
I think she may have figured out the glitch.
bring it back, bring her back. I want constant updates.
Yes, sir. When I find her, I know what to do.
boy, if she's figured out this computer glitch and goes with that to the press, we're royally screwed.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mr. President, we have that luncheon speech followed by a White House meet-and-greet.
what do I do?
go be presidential.
speech today will give some insight into the Eleanor Green situation.
Jack, I've been trying to call her but I can't reach her.
you have a busy schedule. Keep your head in that.
that's terrific.
Saturday Night Live wants you. What do you think?
did I hear "Saturday Night Live"? - Yeah.
do it. - Why?
because it's a great opportunity. Say you were blinded by love, you didn't know she was popping pills.
it isn't like you were in some side street gettin' head like, uh, hugh, uh, what is name.
you're so sensitive. OK. I'll do it.
Yep, he'll do it. I'll call you later for details.
it's hard to believe it's a year since we've gathered together, but we are very pleased to have a most honored guest with us...
I wrote down some lines for you. They're fantastic, if I must say so. I even threw in an old Hitler joke.
how's that supposed to work? - You'll see.
...Tom Dobbs!
knock 'em dead.
thank you very much.
I guess we should get this over with at the beginning, because you've all heard there's a little bit of a rumor going around right now.
so I'll share the big scoop with you, 'cause, uh, Oprah was booked.
I'm not even President of the United States yet, and I'm involved in a scandal with a woman.
I did not have sex with that woman.
I wanted to.
I'm single.
and, uh, you've elected a man as President who is probably the unluckiest man in the world in that area.
in high school, most of my dates were with myself.
I would take myself out for dinner, bring myself home, put on music that I liked, have my way with myself and then go, "Should I drive myself home now?
pretty much the bottom line. If I was in Italy I might get lucky.
they elected an Italian porn star to their senate.
which is wonderful. There's no sex scandal there, just great posters and incredible downloads.
I think that's the bottom line. In a democracy, we can have a sense of humor about ourselves. We have to.
you're allowed to make fun of those in power.
but even in the face of tyranny there is comedy. Two old Jews were sent to kill Hitler.
they waited in an alleyway. They were supposed to kill Hitler at 12: 30. They have guns, bombs, knives.
12: 30, no Hitler.
12: 45, no Hitler.
one o'clock, no Hitler.
finally one turns to the other and goes, "My God, I hope nothing happened to him.
it's good to see us back. The fact that we can laugh is wonderful. But the last few years we've been divided.
red states, blue states.
there are no red and blue states, there's only the United States of America. That's what we're about.
that's why I say you can't spend 200 million dollars on a campaign and not be owing people something.
next thing you know they have to deal with the special interests, they're doing special favors for special people and not dealing with what you need:
education, healthcare, environmental issues.
they have to deal with oil companies, chemical companies, drug companies, and they owe them.
and in the process, people get neglected.
the poor have no advocate, because the poor can't afford a lobbyist.
the Statue of Liberty says, "Give me your tired, your poor,
not "your wealthy, your gifted and your endowed.
I worked out your bit with SNL. They really liked it.
has Eleanor called the headquarters yet? - No.
she hasn't called me either. - Well, you never know with females.
I had an ex who used to do enough tranquillizers to put a flock of sheep to sleep.
Why?
she said it made the sex with me more bearable. - Eleanor didn't do drugs.
Oh, no. And ball players don't do steroids, they just wake up one day looking like Mack trucks.
pump a little iron, you look like a Humvee. - With little tiny balls.
this is a meet-and-greet, nothing more.
Oh, the house is so close to the street.
whoa, boy, that's a desk.
I mean... wow.
I, uh, I never really sat behind a desk before. I mean, the one on the show is just a prop. This...
where do you do your writing? - Usually on the back of a napkin, sitting in a bar.
well, there's a lot of history to this desk.
the first time I sat behind it, I had a sort of nervous chill.
some of the greats and not-so-greats have sat here.
please.
thank you.
excuse me, Mr. President.
Hello? - Tom? Tom?
Eleanor? Hold on.
Mr. President, I'll just be a minute. Thank you.
Tom, t-t-two guys broke into my hotel room. I don't know what to do.
who? Who are they?
they're connected with Delacroy. I think they know I broke the code.
code? What code? - I figured out what caused the computerglitch.
where are you now? - I'm in a shopping mall.
shopping? - No, I'm not shopping.
why are you there? - I didn't know what to do. I thought this was safer.
Mr. President-elect, I'm on a bit of a tight schedule.
listen, Eleanor, I'm with the President. - What?
I'm with the President of the US in the Oval Office.
you're with the President? You're in the Oval Office?
look, Tom, I don't know what to do... Hello?
Tom? Hello?
Hello?
sorry, sir.
Wow.
it's been a pleasure, Mr. President. Thank you.
by the way, Mr. Dobbs, I never thought you had a chance.
I underestimated you.
well, just between you and me, Mr. President, you didn't underestimate me at all.
Really? Why?
Oh, but that's so weird. I never said anything to him.
no, he said stuff to me. Like, what am I gonna say back?
but seri... Hold on a sec.
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.
I need a charger for this phone that I can plug into my cigarette lighter.
we don't stock the charger for that anymore. How long have you had that phone?
well, it's not like it's a relic. It's a year old.
well, there is a problem - it's a year old.
Mr. Stewart would like to see you at Delacroy.
why does he want to see me? - He just wants to talk to you.
reasonable people can come to reasonable solutions.
you figured out the computer glitch. You should be paid.
the Delacroy jet is at the private terminal. I got her.
get in.
get in.
shit!
Yeah.
I'm tracking her on her GPS.
Uh-huh.
Yes, first opportunity I get I'll pick her up, bring her to the airport.
Uh-huh.
the FBI will confirm that you had no contact with Eleanor Green prior to the election.
you're off the hook in terms of being involved in any attempt to fix the election.
sir, we've got to get you to the airport a little earlier. A storm front is moving in.
Oh, for God's sake.
well, after Saturday Night Live tonight, then I'm gonna be heading on.
why so soon?
well, Menken thinks it's for the best. No sense postponing the inevitable.
will you be disappointed to go back to television?
Oh, no. I have a glorious love-hate relationship with TV.
how so? - TV scares me. It makes everything seem credible.
why is that so bad?
if everything seems credible, nothing seems credible.
TV puts everybody in those boxes side by side.
on one side there's this certifiable lunatic who says the Holocaust never happened.
next to him is this noted, honored historian who knows all about the Holocaust.
and now there they sit, side by side. They look like equals.
everything they say seems credible. And so, as it goes on, nothing seems credible anymore.
we just stop listening.
in the Times, 60% of the voters would've voted for Dobbs if they could.
well, yeah. He sounds different. That's why they can hear him.
Hello?
my cell phone died and some guy is after me. - I thought two guys were after you.
no, this is someone else. - Who?
I assume he's from Delacroy. He has a pickup truck.
Eleanor, I... I think you need help.
he tried to abduct me from the mall!
in the mall. OK.
I think it has to do with the fact that I figured everything out.
she's in a phone booth off Route 173.
you see, Mills and Kellogg both have double L's, but Kellogg trumps him with double G's and you trump him with double B's.
I don't know what that means, Eleanor. Listen, where are you?
I don't know. I don't know where I am. It's dark, there's a factory,
I see a Christmas tree...
I don't know where I am.
what do you want me to do now, sir? - I'm willing to offer her big money. Big money.
she's running away now? Why is she running away?
she's impossible. I don't know who she's talking to, what she's saying.
all right, go to the airport. You go to BWI private terminal.
there's a plane there. We'll get on that plane, I'll take you to New York and we'll solve your problem. OK?
private terminal at the airport? I don't know how to get to the airport.
all right, I'll try. I'll look in my GPS or something.
Hello? Eleanor?
more on that breaking news. There has been a very serious traffic accident.
it is tying up traffic out on the Baltimore-Washington Parkwayjust where it meets Route 495, and that is the Capital Beltway.
there has been one serious injury. Police have identified the injured woman as an Eleanor Green.
Oh, my God.
if that sounds familiar, it's the same Eleanor Green... - Menken!
you have to see this!
sir, we just got a report of an accident. It's Eleanor Green.
not now, please.
excuse me.
are you with the ambulance? Eleanor Green?
she's in a stable condition, sir. - Thank you.
Oh, shit. Why does he have to get himself into this mess?
kid driving the truck is from Pittsburgh. Apparently he lost control on the ice, went right off the road.
Tom, we've gotta get to Saturday Night Live. - There's time.
double B... double L... double G.
double B, double L, double G.
double B...
double L... double G.
double L, double G...
they're trying to discredit her. She's not psychotic, OK?
I believe her, for Christ's sake. Look what they did.
last night you were willing to give it all up. Now you want to do it again.
police said a truck lost control.
she was trying to tell me something. - It was snowing.
she said she knew what the computer glitch was. Now it'll be a couple of days before we can find out.
Where's the proof? Give me something to justify what she's saying.
we don't have time to keep playing this game.
she was trying to explain it to me. But it didn't make sense.
she kept saying, "Double B, double G, double L." It's like a code.
whatever the hell happened, we'll never know for sure.
only one thing remains true - you're the President.
you're either getting on that plane or not.
Tom, come January 20th, the White House is yours.
nothing can change that. No one can. Except you.
you coming?
from Studio 8H in the Rockefeller Center, it's Weekend Update with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler!
Hi. I'm Amy Poehler. - I'm Tina Fey. And here are tonight's top stories.
a Malaysian man, famous for pulling planes and buses with his hair, died this week of heart complications.
tragically, he would still be alive but he insisted on pulling his own ambulance.
Hey, I just went through the cue cards, and you're gonna kill.
it's gonna work like a charm. Don't worry about a thing.
do a couple of those Eleanor Green jokes and we get this stuff way, way behind you, all right?
all right. - You can go on and be President.
forensic scientists say they have recreated George Washington as he looked at age 19, while Tom Dobbs has recreated how Thomas Jefferson would've looked if he were crazy.
...and when the source is finally identified, Tom Dobbs will sleep with it.
a report suggests that more species of birds mate for life than previously believed, while other species only mate for votes.
this week Tom Dobbs' presidential transition team briefed him on day-to-day activities in the Oval Office.
however, Dobbs became upset when he learned that Monday would no longer be re-runs.
I heard that! - Uh-oh, who said that?
- Do we have a special guest?
hello. Welcome. You know my wife.
president-elect Tom Dobbs.
just in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop by.
I always wanted to say that - sounds like Bob Hope. "Thought I'd drop by.
thank you for coming. Make yourself comfortable.
lovely. Thank you.
so, we all saw you in Congress in that outfit the other day - that was quite flattering.
those wigs, it's kind of nice.
I love the buckled shoe, though - it's part pimp, part pilgrim.
you can eitherget off the "Mayflower" or have fourgirls in a Cadillac.
they love him. - Yeah, it's working like a charm.
I'm thinking - and this is just out loud that I should go with the Manolo Blanco, just to give you that little...
to lift your ass. - Lift the ass!
next time I want to go stilettos, something crazy.
now, the FBI cleared up any suspicion that you knew Eleanor Green before the election.
not at all, no. - Good.
I guess that absolves you of any conspiratorial thing that you fixed the election.
so what do you make of this woman's obsession with you?
well, Tina, I have just one question: Is this a face that a woman would be obsessed with?
well... - By your pause, I understand.
because I think a woman can be obsessed with a movie star like Brad Pitt - hello!
and I could be obsessed with Angelina - I just want to wet her lips and stick her to something.
and also you could say obsessed with rock 'n ' roll stars
women rushing the stage, fainting, for Elvis, for the Beatles, for Mick Jagger, just to say, "This is your baby!
but women don't rush the stage for comedians.
if they throw their panties on stage for me, it's 'cause they want them fluffed, folded and back by Friday.
I threw my underpants at Britney Spears once... 'cause I thought she needed a pair.
God bless.
I thought you were gonna say you threw it at Paris Hilton and they stuck.
that's a good re-write! - Good night, good luck!
that's from our new book, One Night in Paris.
but, I mean, for me here's the basic thing.
how plausible is it that a woman would fix an election because she's obsessed with me?
I mean, where's the hanging chad?
Where's the governor being your brother? The Supreme Court ruling against the voter?
come on, where's the conspiracy in that? None, really.
and here's the real question: It's like, if that's not why, what is the real answer?
what is the real answer?
thank you for picking that one up. - Where's he going with this?
the bottom line is Eleanor Green came to me and told me that there was a computer glitch in the Delacroy computer voting system.
she warned the chief executive of Delacroy, James Hemmings, but they decided to cover it up for economic reasons.
it's not good for the stock offering, really.
the truth is, I'm not the elected President of the United States.
bottom line is it was a computer error. Not fraud, but a faulty program.
Hal decided it liked me.
today I was in the Oval Office on a preparatory meeting and I sat behind the President's desk and I had a reality check. It kind of overwhelmed me.
I sat there and went, "Wait a minute. I'm a jester.
a jester doesn't rule the kingdom, he makes fun of the king.
and for a brief moment, I thought, you know, "I could be the President of the United States.
I thought I was President of the United States till Eleanor talked to me.
it's... I know. We're not on book anymore and the cue-card guy is going...
we just usually do fake news and jokes.
we don't usually have real news and...
nonjokes.
so watch out, Oprah.
cause we're gonna go real, girl. But here's the deal. A lot of you voted for me, or at least some of you.
Yeah, thank you.
and I know you voted for me because you were fed up with the status quo.
but you were voting forchange, forthe sake of change.
listen, you could vote for someone better. You can do a lot betterthan me.
you can do better than most politicians you've elected recently, and definitely don't put your faith in a machine that has less controls than a Vegas slot machine.
so you don't want to be a part of the reelection? - Oh, no. Please. No, that's not a stage I belong on.
this is where I belong, with folks like you, finding the funk in dysfunctional.
mark Twain said irreverence is the champion of liberty, if not its only defender.
that's why we're there. We're there to shake it up, and that's what we've gotta do.
how many of you think the educational system is working?
Whoo-hoo! - One girl. Thank you.
I learnt to read.
do you realize that 40% of American high-school graduates think that Joan of Arc was Noah's wife?
so Tom Dobbs walked away from being the President of the United States.
OK, so he wasn't really elected, but if he hadn't told anyone...
shortly thereafter, Tom Dobbs went back to his political comedy show.
I'm gonna get on the desk like Tom Cruise.
he was biggerthan ever.
everyone's gonna be writing about how honest you are, how straightforward.
I just hope your honesty doesn't undercut your irreverence.
I wanna do a show about gay farmers and call it "Cropsuckers." Is that offensive?
not for me.
nothing but the best.
yeah?
Hey. - Hi.
like some company?
I left the night-light on.
Eleanor became his producer, and close companion.
lover. Later his wife.
the two Delacroy executives were arrested and later convicted because Eleanor's theories on the computer glitch proved to be correct.
for those of you thinking of getting implants, there's something new to try.
a lot of people, they get the large ones. Those are lovely.
do something new for your boyfriend. Put in a little squeaky toy.
it's about the same. We're pretty easily amused.
you realize that's what it is for us. We're like cats.
also, remember the best birth control, ladies. The best birth control and the cheapest is simply this.
as for President Kellogg, he won against Mills in the reelection, and in his second term was betterthan any of us expected.
not great, but better.
maybe Tom Dobbs had something to do with it. Who knows?
but I like to think that one thing does lead to another.
I'll remember this, ladies and gentlemen. It's an old phrase, basically anonymous, but politicians are a lot like diapers.
they should be changed frequently and for the same reason. Keep that in mind when you vote. Good night.
what's this one do? - Exfoliator, 11. 99.
Oh, gee. - All right.
Hello? - It's me.
glory can't make it. She's got a bad flu.
Oh, no, I need her here. - I told you, Josey, she's sick.
well, can I talk to her?
josey, she's not coming, all right?
what are you doing?
what I was saying was I think we should go to Pearson.
you know? Tell him what's going on. - What do you get out of this?
jeez, Peg, I'm just trying to make things better.
not you. I'm talking to Sherry. How much do you get paid to sell this stuff?
five percent of each sale.
don't expect to get rich from me. I'm not buying.
what about what happened to you, Peg...? - That's my business.
actually, it's all of our business.
it's happening to all of us. - Tell you one thing...
...l'm sick of having my ass grabbed by a bunch of old men.
maybe you've been asking for it.
ever think of that? - Up yours, Peg.
Hey, you could quit tomorrow. Go sell your face cream.
I need my job. - You don't know shit about me.
I need this job just as much as you.
okay, okay. Now, what would you even say to Pearson?
that we've been sexually harassed?
honey, he'd laugh you out of his office. - Not to mention what the guys would do.
all that "never rat on a brother" crap. - Yeah?
union oath says, "Respect fellow members." Where's our respect?
where is it?
come on, who's coming with me?
what else you got there? - A lot.
will it get all the soot off my hands?
sherry, Sherry, quite contrary Kiss my ass, it's really hairy oh, a real funny guy.
what are you doing in the pit?
filling in for Glory while she's out. - Just in time to use the new Porta-Jane?
you don't mind, we took a big dump in that this morning.
Oh, how charming.
sherry!
Hey, cut it out! Stop it!
cut it out!
what the hell's going on? - They got Sherry in the crapper!
stop it, guys! Cut it out, it's not funny!
somebody's gonna get hurt. - Knock it off!
let her out! That's enough.
turn this fucker over!
what the hell?
send her in, please.
miss Aimes. Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Please, sit.
gentlemen.
I asked some of my colleagues to sit in, if you don't mind.
no. - I believe you know Mr. Pavich?
Yes, I do. Mr. Pavich was the one who told me I had to take a day off work...
...to come and see you.
I didn't want to waste your time, sir. - Well, I appreciate that.
but it's not a waste at all.
miss Aimes has a problem, and we're gonna solve it.
thank you, Mr. Pearson.
that's... That's really great.
I didn't want to forget anything, so I wrote a couple of things down...
...on a piece of paper here.
excuse me, Josey... Do you mind if I call you Josey?
no. - I'd like to make this easier for you...
...if you don't mind.
I know what you're going to tell me. I've been well-briefed.
great. I just thought that a few of these...
please, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
okay.
well, the current union contract requires...
...that an employee provide us with two weeks' notice before leaving his position.
however, given how obviously emotional this has been for you...
...we're willing to do something special in this case.
we've decided to waive the two-week requirement...
...and allow you to tender your resignation effective immediately.
no. I'm sorry, I'm not resigning.
Mr. Pavich will take care of the details. - Happy to.
no.
I'm not quitting.
I need this job.
well, then I suggest you spend less time stirring up your female co-workers...
...and less time in the beds of your married male co-workers...
...and more time trying to find ways to improve your job performance.
does anyone else have anything to add?
that says it.
josey, thank you again for making the drive down here.
now, if you don't mind, we have other business.
to teach at Oral Roberts University opened up.
when I informed him that I was leaving in July...
...I recall that his response was that now I would no longer...
...have an excuse for not going out with him.
I told him that I still preferred not to do so. - Hey.
where have you been?
he made a comment that I will vividly remember.
he said that if I ever told anyone of his behavior that it would ruin his career.
this was not an apology...
Sammy, can I come in? - Why?
I was only 20 minutes late.
don't freak. - You know, I'm still the mom here.
Yeah, right.
what's that supposed to mean? - Nothing.
just most people's mothers cook and clean.
they don't work at the mine.
remember you used to tell me you want to be a doctor when you grew up?
so? - So.
I used to tell you you could be anything you want.
isn't it the same for me?
aren't I allowed to be anything I want? - Not when you're doing someone else's job.
bill white's signing some autographs down at the rink on Saturday.
we could go... - I don't want an autograph...
...from one of your loser boyfriends. - He's not my boyfriend.
and he's not a loser.
he broke some record in high school or something.
Yeah. A million years ago. - Jesus, I'm just trying here, you know.
it was something we could do together.
you love hockey... - I quit the team.
you quit?
when?
who cares?
I care.
you love that team. Why didn't you talk to me about it?
because I don't want to talk to you.
don't you get it?
I'll get her to call you.
I'm not leaving till I see her.
she doesn't have the flu, Josey.
God.
guess he told you, huh?
how you feeling? - Great.
I never heard of... I mean, I've heard of Lou Gehrig.
I just never knew about the disease. - I know.
it's...
it's kind of like piece by piece, your body quits listening to you.
like a bullheaded teenager.
so how's Sammy doing?
hates me.
I'd like to say time heals all, but...
well, sooner or later, my liver's gonna crash and burn on me, so until then...
...l'm still in the driver's seat.
you never could keep a secret.
me? The whole town knows I only have one ball because of you.
you only got one what? - Now the whole town knows.
jeez.
does it...? I mean, can you...? - Works great.
you only need one. A big one.
Oh, God.
watch out.
okay? - Yeah.
Hey, you mind if I use your bathroom? - No, go ahead.
but come back smiling, or I'll describe to you what's gonna happen to my asshole.
God, what's that smell? - Toilets overflowed again.
I suggest you ladies get some sponges and buckets...
...and get that room cleaned before somebody gets sick.
what's going on? - Go in.
look for yourself.
Oh, my God.
they can't do this to us.
sure, they can.
they're gonna keep on doing it worse, as long as you keep opening your mouth.
sherry, what they did to you... - You didn't help any.
that's for sure.
don't look at me. This is our lives you're screwing with.
your mess, start cleaning.
Hey, Josey, how you like your new scratch-and-sniff wallpaper?
was it him? Was it?
I give a piece of my check to that union, like everyone else.
you fucked up. What do you want me to say?
Hey, lovebirds, wanna get to work? Or should I dim the lights for you?
josey, get your ass down here. I got a job for you in the Powder Room.
you're one crazy bitch, you know that?
you said you had a job for me. - Yeah.
you like that, don't you?
you like that. To grab your pussy like that, don't you?
forgot you like it a little rough.
you're gonna learn the goddamn rules if I have to beat them into you myself.
damn you, Josey.
he attacked me.
who attacked you? - Bobby, in the Powder Room, just now.
Bobby, you lay a hand on her? - Sure you wanna ask that, Rick?
the answer's no. I wasn't in the Powder Room all day.
he was working the concentrator with me all afternoon.
see? You gonna call me and Earl liars now? Come on.
Ricky.
can somebody drive me home, please?
Where's your dad? - He's on nights.
just take my keys from my locker. - Betty.
don't.
where do you think you're going?
I quit.
the rules are clear. Go around the union, you broke your oath.
glory.
what you doing here? - What's it look like?
I'm here for the meeting.
well, you're not an employee anymore. You're not required to be here.
Yeah, well. Thought maybe I could help you out.
kind of out of control up there, isn't it?
I'm not saying Josey should've gone to management or anything...
we were all sorry to hear you're sick.
glory... - Don't. Don't help me.
I mean, if you help me, I'll cry. Please don't.
need an autographed hockey puck?
got a hundred of them out here. - I need a lawyer.
I wanna sue the mine. The company. All of them.
well, good luck with that.
I'm saying I wanna hire you.
sorry, don't do that anymore.
that sucks, because you're the only lawyer I ever met.
well, the good news is, all roads lead to lawyers.
tell you what. I will buy you a beer, though.
I don't need a beer.
I need a lawyer.
look, Josey, the illusion is that all your problems are solved in a courtroom.
the reality is that even when you win, you don't win.
I know, but I'm right.
I'm sure you are, but right has nothing to do with the real world.
look at Anita Hill. Because she's you.
you think you're outgunned at the mine, wait till you get to a courtroom.
it's called the "nuts and sluts defense."
you're either nuts and you imagined it, or a slut and you asked for it.
either way, it's not pleasant.
take my advice. Find another job. Start over.
I don't have any start-over left.
look, you're a beautiful girl... - Yeah, I'm a beautiful girl.
I could find a guy to take care of me.
I'm done looking to be taken care of.
I wanna take care of myself. Take care of my kids.
you know it's happening to all of us.
every woman up there.
but you don't give a shit, do you?
if somebody like her came to see me back in New York with this dogshit case...
...you know what I'd do?
I'd take it.
settle quick, pocket the contingency...
...make more money than her, never see a courtroom.
Pearson would never settle.
sure he would. - No.
it would be her word against everybody else.
all the guys up there can't be bad, which makes some of them witnesses.
that mine is bread and butter for people around here.
nobody wants to shit where they eat.
what is this place? Like a pet cemetery or something?
why, you got a lot of pet elk at home?
so they never picked on Glory, why?
would you wanna pick a fight with Glory?
no, Glory became a union rep early on. She did some good things.
got their respect.
Plus, she doesn't wanna run with the herd.
keeps her head above the fray. - Safety in numbers.
herds. They stay together, they have a chance.
they separate, they're easy prey.
can you get the other women?
you know what a class action is?
it's when a bunch of plaintiffs have the same issue.
file a claim on behalf of the whole group, the class.
it's tough for the company to argue that you're all lying.
you're all crazy. It's why you have to get the others.
why'd you change your mind?
it's never been done before.
sexual harassment class action.
so you'd be doing this just because it's never been done.
Yeah.
can you live with that?
sue them?
are you kidding? - You know what's going on up there.
life is too short, trust me.
not too short to do something good with it.
how do you know? You're still alive.
so are you, you know. - You call this alive?
get out of here.
I didn't... - Get the hell...
...out of here.
it's not just one or two bad guys.
it takes a village to do what's being done here.
I'm not saying all of them.
but enough of them.
in the plant, out in the pit, and even up in the offices...
...all with the foot on the throat of every woman in that mine.
it's not just my client who needs relief from this court, Your Honor.
we are asking for an injunction to protect all the women.
further, we ask the court to certify a class.
a class made up of every woman working at Pearson...
...because every one of them deserves protection under the law.
doesn't a class actually require more than one plaintiff?
this complaint was filed on behalf of one Josey Aimes.
the key word being "one."
by comparison, we have affidavits from 13 women...
...all stating there have been no incidents of abuse...
that is not true.
Hey.
sit down.
it's not true. - Sit down.
your Honor, are you as confused as we are?
I don't think Miss conlin is supposed to be waving around a pile of paper...
...without letting us see it first, is she?
no, she's not. Miss conlin. - They'll be submitted to the court today.
it doesn't matter what kind of document they've been intimidated into signing...
give me a break. - Please.
get me three plaintiffs. - Your Honor, please.
counselor, if those affidavits are legitimate, you shouldn't have an objection.
I'll continue to hear evidence on Aimes v. Pearson, et al.
if you find three plaintiffs with similar grievances, I'll give you your class action.
thank you, Your Honor.
okay, then, here we go.
we'll just hold it against your throat.
push the button. Push the button.
there you go. Give it a try now. - Glory.
ms. Dodge?
my name is Leslie conlin. I'm an attorney. I represent Pearson Taconite and Steel.
we know who you are.
what do you want?
I brought one for you to look at.
get the hell out of here.
I said, get out. - You should be ashamed of yourself.
she's not represented by counsel. I have the right...
she's represented by me.
I'll have to ask you to leave.
as long as you're alive, you can be subpoenaed.
why, you...! - Fuck you.
bitch.
you keep this crap away from us, you understand?
glory.
the reason I'm here is to ask you to reconsider.
Jesus, are you fucking kidding?
it's not your decision, Kyle. It's hers.
glory, you know all this is not just about Josey. This affects everybody.
she already decided.
you think I don't want to stick it up their asses?
then why don't you do it? - And what if we lost?
and I had to go back to that mine every day and face those sons of bitches?
no way.
who else you got so far?
lt'd just be you and me.
are you crazy?
you know what they did to me.
no way, man.
I got my own problems.
Hey, Mama. You okay?
if she gets any other women, they'll get their class and you'll lose this case.
Leslie, why do you think I hired you?
because you're the smartest lawyer I could find?
no. I hired you because you were the smartest woman lawyer I could find.
but if you're getting soft, I need to know now.
I'm not soft.
but I am pragmatic. - Do the Minnesota Vikings...
...have to put a girl in at quarterback? Of course not.
some things are for men and some things are for women.
mining is men's work. - Like lawyering.
see, a man would never say something like that.
women take everything too personally.
you're gonna take it personally if she wins.
first of all, you're not insured for punitive damages.
Plus, a loss here will change the way you run your business.
Porta-Johns will be a blip on the radar.
there'll be paid leave for pregnancies. Lawyers to draft sexual-harassment policy.
not to mention that you will have helped establish...
...a legal precedent that will affect every single company in America...
...including the Minnesota Vikings. - Except she's not going to win.
this woman is a single welfare mother with two kids out of wedlock...
...a sordid sexual history... - we don't know if that's true.
send him in, please.
Mr. Sharp.
would you share with Miss conlin what you told me today?
mom?
everything all right?
how are you and the kids supposed to eat if you don't have a job?
I'm your mother, Josey.
I haven't always been the best at it, I know.
but I'm here.
you give away my hard-earned money, then you toss your shoulders at me?
I didn't give it away.
I gave it to Josey. - I work hard for that money, Alice.
Oh, and I don't?
maybe I should charge you for every load of laundry.
she said Bobby Sharp attacked her at the mine.
not the story I heard. - There's only one story, Hank.
your daughter's. - Those girls are just asking for trouble.
Oh, are you saying Josey asked for it?
I'm saying I had to find some sandpaper for the bathroom wall the other day.
stuff was scratched right into the metal.
what's going on up there? - They don't belong.
they never did, and you know it. - I know she's our daughter.
our daughter's brought nothing but shame on this family.
and I'm so goddamn sick of her!
she had a baby, Henry.
she didn't rob a bank.
Alice.
is Hank with you? - No.
he's not.
I need a room, Tom.
you know, I can't help it if she wants to get into my pants.
Oh, Jesus.
you okay?
I never did anything to this bitch.
that's right.
now she wants to sue all of us?
you know what a class action is, don't you?
it means it's all of them against all of us!
that's right, this bitch wants to take...
...every single swinging dick in this room to court.
now, the other women have shown us something here in the past few months.
telling the truth for a change.
how about you? How about that, huh?
who knew? Who knew?
how about you, ladies?
I just hope nobody's thinking of breaking the ranks.
okay, that's it, let's go.
okay.
we all thank Mr. Sharp and the others for their enthusiastic comments.
before we take the oath, are there other brothers who want a turn at the gavel?
Yeah, I'd like a turn at the gavel.
Oh, she's really lost it now.
get the fuck out of here!
get your ass home! - I asked if any brothers would like to speak.
bylaws say no meeting can adjourn if a member wants to speak his or her mind.
I got your gavel right here, bitch!
I am s...
I'm still a member of this union.
come on. Come on! - Well?
say it! - Yeah!
my... My name is Josey Aimes, and... - Hey, Josey!
show us your tits!
don't look at me, Hank! I'm not the one can't control his family.
listen... No. Rules say she gets to talk.
you can have the gavel next, but right now she's got it.
I'll take it next and... - All right, but she's got it!
she's got it.
can't hear you. - I can't hear you.
my father never wanted me to work here.
that's right. - Sit on this and talk.
pretty much stopped talking to me because of it.
some of you here think I wanna shut down the mine.
don't worry, sweetheart, we won't let it happen!
I don't wanna shut down the mine.
I just wanna go to work like everyone else.
get paid end of the week, feed my kids, and hell...
...maybe now and then have enough for a beer at Tee-Gees Saturday night.
and not a woman in that back row don't know what I'm talking about.
you all know what's been done.
time's up! - We need these jobs.
and it's not gonna stop until we say stop!
three-minute rule! - There's no three-minute rule!
you heard the man! Get the fuck out!
it's not gonna stop until we say stop!
I have a right to say... - Give me that, please.
three-minute rule. - There's no three-minute rule!
may I have it, please? - Pop.
I'm not done. - I know. Please.
come on, Hank. - Please.
come here, baby.
stay with me.
let her go, Hank. - Come on, let her go.
my name is Hank Aimes.
and I been a ranger all of my life. - So have I!
but I ain't never been ashamed of it till now.
when we take our wives and daughters to the company barbecue...
...I don't ever hear anybody calling them those names...
...like "bitches" and "whores" and worse.
I don't ever see nobody grabbing them by their privates or, you know...
...drawing pictures of them on the bathroom walls doing unspeakables.
unspeakables.
so, what's changed?
she's still my daughter.
isn't she?
it's a heck of a thing...
...watch one of your own get treated that way, you know.
you're all supposed to be my friends.
my brothers. Well...
right now, I don't have a friend in this room.
fact, the only one here that I'm not ashamed of...
...is my daughter.
Oh, it's tough stuff, getting up in front of all those sons of bitches.
no. "Tough" is sticking this shit out day after day...
...without bitching and moaning.
what are you doing in here?
that stuff really gets the soot off your hands.
doesn't it?
all I'm saying...
...It's easy for her to get up and say whatever she wants when she already quit.
the rest of us still gotta work here. - Easy? I'd like to see you do it.
it's easy when you're crazy.
she's definitely crazy.
Hey, let me borrow some of that cream. - Buy your own.
creep took half of mine. - So you're okay getting on that stand...
...and saying she's lying, right?
I'm gonna do what I gotta do.
Plus, we all signed those affidavits already...
...which means we don't have a choice anymore, right?
right, Betty?
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
who is Sammy's father?
I don't know who Sammy's father is.
because you've had so many sexual partners?
objection. Plaintiff's sexual history is irrelevant, Your Honor.
overruled.
miss conlin, who is the gentleman entering the courtroom?
Mr. Paul Lattavansky, Your Honor, Miss Aimes' high school teacher.
we've subpoenaed him as an impeachment witness.
I have so many objections, I don't know where to start.
witness will answer. - Again:
miss Aimes, who is Sammy's father...? - My son...
...has got nothing to do with any of this.
is it true that you and your teacher...
...Mr. Lattavansky, had a sexual relationship at one time?
a "relationship"?
what the hell you been telling them, Bobby?
miss Aimes, did you not, at the age of 16, engage in a sexual relationship...
...with your high school teacher?
Oh, Josey, stay a moment, would you?
I'd like to have a word with you.
later.
okay.
what are you doing hanging around a boy like Bobby Sharp?
you have so much more going for you...
...than a kid like that'll ever have.
do you like me, Josey?
far as teachers go. - Yeah.
you're my favorite student.
did I ever tell you that?
no. - Yeah.
frankly...
josey? - Yeah?
I'd like to think of you as more than that.
no, no, it's okay.
maybe even as a friend.
what are you doing? - It's okay.
what are you doing? - No, it's okay.
please don't do this, Mr. L. - No, it's okay.
it'll be our little secret, okay?
no, no, no!
No!
No! No, stop! Stop!
stop it! I don't wanna do this! Stop it!
it's okay. It's okay. - Stop!
stop!
are there any other witnesses to this alleged rape?
anybody besides Mr. Sharp that can corroborate your testimony?
no.
isn't it true that there was no rape? In fact, you have a long history...
...of inappropriate sexual relationships... - objection.
at the very least, we're talking statutory rape.
it's outrageous. - You raped my daughter...
Hank! - Order! Bailiff!
help! - Remove that man!
everybody take your seats.
miss Aimes? Miss Aimes, return to the stand, please.
return to the stand, Miss Aimes!
your Honor, move for recess? Please.
josey, wait. Slow down. - No, I can't. I've gotta get home to Sammy.
we're gonna stay here tonight.
that's crazy, Mom.
he's gonna come home.
all the same.
we're gonna stay here.
I'd rather give you money...
...if that's all right with you.
that's a pretty old watch.
was just looking at it.
she's lying, you know. She didn't get raped by that teacher.
she was just saying that so she'll win her lawsuit.
it's illegal for her to say that if it's not true.
she should go to jail.
I don't care.
she's a whore, just like everybody says.
I wonder if it's illegal to call your own mother a whore.
sure sounds bad enough to be. - She's a liar.
my father didn't die in the Army.
he's a scumbag raper.
it's a hard truth to tell, Sammy. - That's crap.
I got a right. - Yeah, you got a lot of rights...
...starting with the right to be pissed off.
in fact, you got a right to hate the whole world right now.
I don't hate the whole world.
I just hate her.
takes a lot of work to hate someone.
you ready to put in that kind of time?
to really hate your mom...
...you gotta think over and over again about all the things you hate about her.
she's mean to you.
never proud of you.
never comes to watch your hockey games.
leaves you hungry, never buys you clothes. - I'm not stupid.
I know what you're doing. - What's that?
I know she does all those things.
Yeah.
but you hate her anyway.
Yeah.
I hate her guts.
well, you're lucky.
she never gave up on you as quick as you're giving up on her.
when she was a bit older than you are now...
...she got pregnant in a way nobody should get pregnant.
would've been a lot easier...
...to give you up to someone else.
nobody would've blamed her if she did, but she didn't. She stuck by you.
and she's still sticking by you...
...even though she knows you hate her.
she's still there waiting...
...hoping you'll get your ass home.
take it. - What?
well, if you wanna run off, you can sell it and use the money.
or just put it on your wrist.
either way, it's yours.
one friend to another.
Karen, go to bed.
I'll wake you when he comes back.
it's me.
I didn't want you, Sammy.
something bad had happened to me, and I just wanted it to be over.
but every day my belly grew, and it just reminded me of it.
never even occurred to me that there was a baby in there.
that you were in there.
that day, what that man did to me...
...it made me into something different.
and I guess...
I guess I thought...
I was a girl who was raped, and you were this...
...thing...
...that just kept reminding me of it.
Oh, God, I've dreaded this conversation since the day you were born.
I don't want any more secrets between us.
this one night...
...I was lying in bed...
...and you moved inside me...
...like this tiny little butterfly, just fluttering around in there.
and all of a sudden, I realized...
I just knew...
I knew you weren't his.
you were mine.
you were my baby.
and we were gonna be in it together.
just the two of us.
you had nothing to do with that ugliness, you hear me? Nothing.
and there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do to be your mom.
I should've told you.
it's over, isn't it?
not yet.
Mr. Sharp, do you know the difference between consensual sex and rape?
Oh, yeah.
but when you're having a good time like she was...
...ain't no rape. That's for damn sure.
are you a virgin?
no. I ain't a virgin. - Objection, Your Honor. Relevance?
she can ask about my client's sexual history, but I can't ask this witness?
no, you can't. Sustained.
why didn't you help her? - Objection.
you saw Josey being attacked.
miss Aimes' testimony has not been corroborated by evidence.
neither has his. And my client would like to prove that he's lying.
I'm allowing it. For now.
Bobby?
when you saw Josey being attacked, why didn't you help her?
you know, you can use all the lawyer mumbo-jumbo you want...
...this still was no attack. - I asked around about you, Bobby.
folks say you're kind of soft. - They ain't man enough...
...to say it to my face. - Are you a red-ice player, then?
how's that? - I had a coach used to say:
win or lose, leave your blood on the ice.
good coach.
Yeah.
you're what coach would call...
...a yellow-ice player.
the kind that wets his pants when things get rough.
objection. Argumentative. - Denied.
she was your friend. You watched him put his filthy hands on her, and you ran away.
it wasn't like that. - Your Honor.
sustained. Mr. White... - what, he held her down, spread her legs...
...jammed himself up inside her...? - Mr. White!
Rangers are hard as steel, huh?
not this one.
this one's made of butter.
you gonna keep lying about your friend, or you gonna stand up and be a man?
objection. - I'm not lying.
you wanna run right now, don't you? - Fuck you.
that's enough. - You wanna run?
I didn't run. - Or you gonna put your guts on the ice?
what's it gonna be? Yellow?
or red?
yellow or red?
yellow or red?! - What was I supposed to do?!
he was raping her, wasn't he?
Yeah.
and you ran.
what was I supposed to do?
what are you supposed to do...
...when the ones with all the power are hurting those with none?
well, for starters, you stand up.
you stand up and tell the truth.
you stand up...
...for your friends.
objection, Your Honor. - You stand up...
...even when you're all alone.
you stand up. - All right.
Mr. White, if you are through... - Excuse me.
what is going on back there?
this is Glory.
she worked at Pearson's.
she wants to say:
my name is Glory Dodge.
and I'm not fucking dead yet.
I stand with Josey.
your Honor? - Your Honor said we needed three plaintiffs.
it's still only two.
ready?
Yeah!
nice.
Yeah! - Oh, yeah!
Hey, your son was just telling me how rich you guys are now.
Oh, really? - You gonna buy me a car?
no. You're not old enough to drive yet. - So?
why are we stopping?
well, if you want a car someday, you gotta know how to drive it, right?
first lesson:
driver sits behind the wheel.
come on, move your butt.
seat belt.
all right.
what do I do? - Okay.
put your foot on the accelerator. Gently, okay?
and stay on the road if you can.
go on, go on.
all right. Let's take a tiny little bit at a time. Okay.
slow down.
slow down, racecar driver.
there you go. You're a natural.
and in their triumph die, like fire and powder...
which, as they kiss, consume...
gran?
Edward, don't! She will see you.
okay.
grandma, I would like you to meet...
happy birthday, Bella.
happy birthday, Bells.
I thought we agreed, no presents.
well, the one from me is not wrapped.
so, don't count.
it's actually great. Thanks, Dad.
uh, goes with this one from your mom.
we coordinated. Well, she coordinated me.
it's to put your pictures in, from senior year.
senior year.
how'd you get so old so fast? - I didn't.
it's not that old. - I don't know.
is that a grey hair?
No! No way!
happy Birthday.
it's really funny.
another missing hiker brings the total to three presumed deaths.
the Rangers are searching for the killer animal...
Oh, it's Bella. Bella!
today is the big day, Bella.
uh, "R and J" essay due? - Oh, yeah!
wherefore art thou, Bella?
I wanna take a picture of you guys. My Mom...
wants me to put together, like...
a scrapbook full of memories. - Oh, of course, yeah.
I take them, I'm not in them. - No, no, no, come here.
you'll photoshop my nose if it looks big, right?
don't worry, I'm in the picture. No one will be looking at you guys.
it's good.
Oh, good. Cullen's here.
well, catch you later.
happy birthday. - Don't remind me.
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
but my aging is not. - Your aging?
I think 18 is all youngster, don't worry about that.
it's one year older than you.
no, it isn't.
I'm a hundred and nine. - Wow!
maybe I should not be dating such an old man.
it's gross!
I should feel certainly repulsed.
we have to go to class. - Ok.
wait a second.
someone wants you.
Bella. - Jacob!
I'll leave you to talk.
Hello, biceps!
you know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.
well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
you know, wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
we should switch schools.
then you can come hang out with the pale faces.
I'm alright.
I prefer the Residential School's exclusivity.
they let any old rift raft into this place.
I see. Why are you summing it?
I was just buying a part for the "Rabbit."
you should really come, take a ride, when it's done.
is it fast? - Huh, it's decent.
okay. - Okay, good.
Hey, happy birthday.
your Dad told my Dad. So...
Yeah, of course, he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
it catches bad dreams.
it's perfect.
thank you. - No problem.
see you soon. Bye. - Yeah, see you later.
so, how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
because I have nothing to give back to you.
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.
see? Thank you. That's all I want.
Bella!
happy Birthday! - Shhh!
I thought, I said no presents.
I've already seen you open it and guess what?
you love it!
you're gonna wear it tonight, our place.
come on, please? It will be fun.
okay. alright. - Great! Okay, I'll see you at 7: 00.
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.
sorry, Bella.
happy...
never mind.
you can't trust vampires.
trust me!
o, my love! My wife!
death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath.
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
thou art not conquered.
beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
and death's pale flag is not advanced there.
I hate being celebrated.
there are worse tragedies.
hm, look at Romeo.
he kills his true love out of sheer stupidity.
Yeah.
though I do envy him, one thing.
Juliet. She's like perfect.
if you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
no, not the girl, dear.
the suicide.
it's nearly impossible for some people.
for humans, a little poison...
a dagger to the heart...
so many different options.
why would you say that?
because I considered it once.
I didn't know, if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of...
plan.
and what was the plan?
I would go to Italy, and provoke the Volturi.
the what? - The Volturi...
now, who would like to repeat the last few lines...
just to show, they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen.
Oh, yes, Mr. Birdy.
o, here.
will I set up my everlasting rest,
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
eyes, look your last!
arms, take your last embrace!
and lips, O, you, the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss.
a dateless bargain to engrossing death!
eyes on the screen, people.
thus with a kiss I die.
the Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess, the closest thing to royalty my world has.
is that Carlisle? - Yeah.
he lived with them for a few decades.
described them as very refined.
no respect for human life, of course, but respect for the arts and science as at least.
and the law， above all of law.
and vampires have laws?
not very many.
there's only one and it's regularly enforced.
what is it?
to keep the existence of our kind a secret.
we don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously.
unless, of course, you want to die.
we have to stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.
and I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
that's not true.
Victoria? She will come for me one day.
Alice will see what she decides and...
we will be ready. - I can protect you.
if you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
you're my only reason to stay alive, if that's what I am.
but it's my job to protect you.
from everyone... except my sister.
it's time!
it's time! It's time! It's time!
sorry about all this. We tried to rein Alice in.
like it's even possible.
happy big Birthday, Bella! - Thanks.
I found it in your bag, mind?
dating an older woman? Hot!
what?
you first, Rosalie.
it's a necklace.
Alice picked it up. - Thanks.
show me the love!
this is from Emmett.
already installed it in your truck.
finally, a decent sound system for that piece of...
Hey, don't... don't hate the truck.
open Esme and Carlisle's.
just a little something to brighten your day.
we think, you looking kind of pale lately.
paper cut.
Jas... Jas!
it's okay. It's just a little...
blood.
get Jasper out of here.
I'm sor... I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
check on Jasper.
I'm sure, he's very upset with himself.
and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward?
I never wanted that party. - It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
how do you do it?
years and years of practice.
did you ever think it of...
just doing it the easier way?
no.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
brings me happiness.
even if I'm damned about this.
damned?
like... like hell?
Carlisle, you can't be damned.
you couldn't, it's impossible.
thank you, Bella.
you always been very gracious about us.
so, that's it?
that's why he won't change me?
imagine the situation in reverse.
if you believed as Edward does...
would you take away his soul?
you can't protect me from everything.
at some point, something's gonna separate us.
it's gonna be an accident, or illness, or old age.
as long as I'm human.
and the only solution is to change me.
that's not a solution, it's a tragedy.
you're not gonna love me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you? No?
Carlisle told me...
how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
so don't worry about mine.
you should go inside.
it's still my birthday.
can I ask one thing?
kiss me?
I love you.
I love you.
Hi.
come for a walk with me.
we got to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's supposed to be ten years older than he looks.
people are starting to notice.
okay, I...
I gotta think of something to say to Charlie.
when you say "we..."
I mean to my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper? - It's nothing. - You're right.
it was nothing.
nothing the way I always expected.
and nothing compared to what could have happened.
you just don't belong to my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
no, you don't.
I'm coming.
Bella.
I don't want you to come.
you don't want me?
no.
this changes things. A lot.
alright.
but if it's not too much to ask...
can you at least promise me something?
don't do anything reckless.
for Charlie's sake.
and I'll promise something to you in return.
this is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back.
and you can go on with your life...
without any interference from me.
it will be like...
I never existed, I promise.
if this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want without you. - It's not about your soul.
you're just not good for me.
I'm not good enough for you?
I'm just sorry, I let this go on for so long.
please...
don't.
goodbye.
Edward?
Edward!
Edward!
I'll try to call Cullens place again.
the Cullens left town, Charlie. - Good riddance!
where did they go?
we'll find her, Charlie. - Thanks, Harry.
Charlie?
she's alright.
I got her.
thank you, Sam.
Alice, you have disappeared.
like everything else.
but who else can I talk to? I'm lost.
when you left...
and he left...
you took everything with you.
but the absence of him is everywhere I look...
it's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
but in a way I'm glad.
the pain is my only reminder that he was real...
that you all were.
alright, that's it.
what?
you're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
bells...
he's not coming back.
I know.
it's just not normal, this behavior.
quite frankly, it's scaring the hell outta me, and you Mother.
baby, I... I don't want you to leave.
I don't.
but... just go...
go to Jacksonville, make some new friends...
I like my old friends. - Well, you never see them anymore.
I do, yeah.
I'm...
gonna go shopping tomorrow, with Jessica.
you hate shopping.
I...
I need a girl's night out.
alright. Girl's night.
shopping.
I like it, go.
buy some good stuff.
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.
Oh, yeah, Bella Swan.
I don't know, why you wanna sit through all those zombies eating people, and no hot guys kissing anybody. It's gross.
like why there are so many zombie movies anyway?
is it supposed to like draw a parallel with leprosy?
my cousin had leprosy, it's not funny, you know?
and like is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
because don't be so pleased with your own like...
self-reverential cleverness, you know?
like, some girls like to shop.
not all girls, apparently.
