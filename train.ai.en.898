it's not a test. It's a lesson...
the first of many. This one is simple.
to stop me, you're going to have to sacrifice the people you care about, even the ones you care about just a little, like Cyrus there.
as a bonus, your friends in Romania are about to suffer as well.
I'm sorry.
I told her.
KRILOV FACTORY, ROMANIA
target reached. Moving in.
got you in view.
hold positions.
Rlex
old news.
ops, We got an empty nest here.
sig INT ERFERENCE
ops, signal is lost. Can you
if you really wanted to teach me something, why aren't you here
it's not in the lesson plan, not this time.
I'll give you 20 seconds.
Nikita, we have to go. - I'm not leaving.
listen to Michael. She will kill you.
and believe it or not...
that would upset me very much.
please, go.
no.
I get it now...
the lesson.
the things we care about can hurt us, so the trick is not to care.
Nikita, no!
let's see how well you learn.
what are you waiting for
do it!
do it!
cover me.
what now
how did
michael said you might need some backup.
why'd you do this for me
why'd you risk your life
don't take this the wrong way, but I didn't.
Amanda wants to teach me a lesson, she can't do it if I'm dead. She cares too much.
she's not done with me yet.
so what are we looking at-- a farm in Iowa, maybe something by the beach in Maine
we were wondering, after St. Lucia and Romania, if you think you can still operate your business.
it'll take some damage control, some fence-mending, but, yeah, absolutely.
consider yourself reinstated.
help us get what we need to run operations and shut the doors on Division.
what's this
it's a list of organizations and individuals with whom you can no longer do business, not as a sanctioned American agent.
it's, like, everyone I ever sold
I like a challenge.
good.
we'll be in touch.
what?
I knew you were warming up to me.
I knew you'd pick a side.
what's the real reason you didn't give me up to Percy
you were doing the right thing.
let's just say that you remind me of someone.
you're still here.
Yeah, just debriefed with Ryan.
great.
look, about Romania, I just wanted to say
no need to explain yourself. It's fine.
well, I wasn't gonna explain myself.
I-I just wanted to say thank you.
michael asked me to do a job, and I did it.
that's all.
another rogue in from the cold, and we've taken the Sideswipe off the black market for good.
any update on the mole
Yeah, I think I'm, uh, getting close.
and what about Amanda
any theories as to her next move
Yes.
before today, I thought that Amanda just wanted me dead because I was the obstacle to her plans.
but that's not it.
I am her plan.
she doesn't want to kill me.
she wants me to suffer, and that means destroying everything I care about.
I'm not her target.
all of you are.
1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE 5: 28 PM
division
division TWELVE HOURS EARLIER
saying your good-byes?
more like good riddance.
my trip to Washington was very fruitful.
the president came through. We're getting our pardons.
should have them by week's end.
she kept to her word.
that's because she's afraid of us.
she knows what we know, what we could do to her.
she's one of the only people in the world who knows about Division.
she should be afraid.
Nikita, is there something you want to say?
now's not the time to do anything rash, Nikita, or I may have to do something rash in return, like push the trigger to activate the nanotoxin in Michael's blood.
I just can't believe the end is in sight.
Yeah.
there were plenty of times I didn't think we'd make it.
so you're okay with letting go of pursuing Amanda?
michael convinced me to move on.
Yeah.
now, that is what I call true love.
what did you want to show me?
remember when Nikki went hunting for Amanda in that aqueduct?
you mean when your comms went out?
Yeah, see, my comms don't just go out.
not like that.
I ran some tests.
there's nothing wrong with the tech.
well, maybe Shadownet's not up to snuff yet. Shadownet's got plenty of snuff.
it's got snuff coming out of its ears.
no, I did some digging
there was a jamming field dropped over the entire area.
jamming field?
last time we saw one of those, it was- - Amanda.
she used it in Colombia when you guys went after Ramon.
I checked.
it's the same power signature.
why would Amanda jam that aqueduct?
she didn't want us to hear something, or someone.
Nikita said there was no one down there, just her.
Yeah, see, that's the other thing.
Nikki was out of contact for 22 minutes.
that's a long time to be wandering around a supposedly empty aqueduct.
you saying she lied?
if the power signature fits--look, Mikey, we still don't know what Amanda did to her in that chair.
we've seen this before, the lies, the cover ups.
it's Alex all over again.
where is she?
I need more time.
my conditions were clear.
I gave you 24 hours to kill the president.
I need-- I need tactical plans.
I need mission support. I need a team.
no. No help from anyone.
you tell anyone, and Michael is dead before you finish the sentence.
listen to me, you bitch
this is not a negotiation. - I could't
they say every good plan allows for some unpredictability, but I confess, I fail to see the need to enlist as volatile an element as Nikita.
the group wants the president dead.
I want Nikita branded a killer for the whole world to see.
our interests dovetail perfectly.
trust me, this is how we all get what we want.
Ryan, you really need to see this.
this is Dr. Tolcher.
the scientist who developed the poison?
not just a poison. A nanotoxin.
microscopic particles that lie dormant in your blood until someone triggers them to release a toxin.
scientifically, it's an incredible achievement.
what's your interest?
this guy was experimenting on human subjects.
where did they come from?
in other words, human trafficking.
how does a guy like this get hooked into that world?
the Pormise of Nanomedicine
how does he get mixed up with some shadowy global organization that trades in innocent lives?
this is medical.
Yeah, Sonya, is Nikita down there with you?
no. - Has anyone seen her?
she was in Ops.
well, she's not here anymore.
Why? What's wrong?
we think Nikki's been acting weird.
like Amanda weird.
hang on.
someone just started the car lift.
she's headed up top.
where are you going?
to take care of a few things.
I'm in a rush.
is that what it feels like?
like what you have to do is so important that it just can't wait?
Michael-- - It's not real.
Amanda has gotten into your head, just like she did with Alex.
that's not it.
Nikita, put the gun down.
think about what you're doing.
this is--this is Amanda. We've seen this before.
Yes, we have.
I'm sorry, Michael. I can't help it.
she's in my head. I can't shut her out.
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.
Nikita, you can fight this.
let me help you.
there's so much I want to say.
not now.
not until we can be alone together.
I wish I knew when that will be.
sorry, Michael.
I can't help it. She's in my head.
I can't shut her out.
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.
Nikita, you can fight this.
let me help you.
something's not right.
what Amanda does isn't possession.
when I did the things that I did, my actions felt natural, the result of my own choices.
I wasn't aware that I was being manipulated.
so you're saying this isn't one of Amanda's Jedi mind tricks?
I don't think so.
Nikita's doing this on her own?
doing what? And why the act?
to send us a message.
Georgetown
Georgetown 9: 12 AM
Susan?
Janet Malcolm.
president Spencer's personal aide. We met in Toronto during the G20.
I arranged for you to get into the gala.
Yes, of course. How are you?
good. - It's good to see you.
you too. Well, what are you doing here?
I'm teaching a seminar at Georgetown.
the press department was looking for you in Toronto.
Yeah, they wanted to do a little media package on your close relationship with the president, get you talking about her impact on your life.
she has had an impact.
Janet, I'm glad I ran into you.
I need to ask you something.
I need to get on the President's calendar today.
today? - I know it's short notice, but I have something very important I need to speak with her about.
well, I'm sorry, but no one gets on the President's calendar that fast.
I mean, not unless World War III is breaking out.
and plus, the Secret Service would still have to pre-screen
I'm sorry. I really am.
but I'm not asking.
she said there were things she wanted to say, but we had to...
wait until we can be alone together.
wait until we can be alone.
maybe she knew we were watching her on security cams?
or maybe Amanda was listening.
when Amanda forced me to be her mole,
I couldn't tell any of you, because I knew that she was monitoring me.
that's why Nikki was acting so squirrelly.
Nikita was trying to tell us she's been bugged.
Tolcher's subcutaneous comm.
Amanda could have implanted one in Nikita.
Birkhoff, can you reverse engineer the chip in Tolcher?
isolate the frequency Amanda's using?
we might be able to use that to
to track the comm that's in Nikki.
Yeah, I think so.
you want to go play operation?
call in, tell them you'll be out sick, and get me on the President's schedule.
I don't have the authority to do that.
Janet, I found you.
I can easily track where your home is, your family.
Tracy. Could you do me a favor?
I forgot to put someone on the schedule.
a Susan Mason.
okay, I got a lock on the frequency.
it's coming from D. C.
she's in Washington?
I just checked the armory.
in addition to her Glock, she took a silencer, a PSG-1 sniper rifle and scope, plus match grade ammo.
that's a kill mission kit.
she told me Spencer should be afraid of her.
she was trying to warn me.
warn you of what?
she's going to try and kill the President.
look, I'm not going to hurt you, all right?
a construction crew will be here in a few hours.
they'll find you. You'll be fine.
you try to get by Secret Service without clearance, and they will shoot you.
if I fail, there'll be no reason to live.
Amanda, the president is inside the White House all day.
no chance to sniper from long range.
but I did get an appointment to see her.
I knew you'd find a way.
I still have to get past White House security.
I told you I needed a team for this.
not that you would know anything about needing friends.
Oh, I know all about how valuable having the right friends can be.
get me Stirling.
Nikki, I'm talking to you through your car's onboard navigation system.
Birkhoff? - No time to explain.
we have a very short window.
win window for what?
you have to get out of here now.
let me go.
you don't know what you're doing.
we know about Amanda's bug.
Birkhoff's jamming it.
no.
you can't. She'll know.
no, it's disguised as interference.
she'll think you went through a tunnel or something.
as long as we don't cut her out for too long.
just long enough to stop you from killing the President.
we know. We got your message.
I've lost Nikita's signal.
if you can't clear it up in a few seconds, let me know.
yes Madam.
we know Amanda didn't alter your brain, so what did she do to you?
she didn't do anything to me.
she did something to you.
the nanotoxin is embedded in the carbon fiber bone of your new hand.
if I don't fulfill her mission, she won't give me the antidote.
I kill the President, or you die, Michael.
I have to go. Amanda's going
there's no way I'm letting you go through with this.
what happens to you if you do? I'd rather
you'd rather die?
that's why I didn't tell you.
you can't just-- - What choice do I have?
why did you give us clues if you didn't want us to stop you?
because if I have to go through with this, I wanted you to know why.
what if there's another way?
we take the nanotoxin out of play.
we know there's an antidote.
no, we already used the last dose on Maryam Hasan.
okay, so we find more.
in the research, we found another scientist.
his name is Kang.
if anything, it looks like Tolcher was working heavily from his theories.
he may be able to make more antidote.
I can't go. Amanda's watching.
we can.
stick to your plan so she doesn't suspect.
we'll go find the antidote.
I can buy you some time.
Michael, if you want to save me, save yourself.
how do we know Dr. Kang isn't working for the Shop too? - We don't.
part of me hopes he's dirty.
at least I could punch someone.
Alex, look.
if this goes bad, I'm worried about what it'll do to Nikita.
make her understand that her family, the one that she's built, is there for her.
she started this journey by herself.
I need to know she will not end it alone.
she won't.
I promise.
excuse me. You can't be here.
Dr. Kang, CIA.
we need a moment of your time.
white HOUSE
white HOUSE
white HOUSE
I'm here on Commander Evan Danforth's orders.
you have anything about this?
this is Blue 1.
we have an unsub in the tunnels and are investigating.
lock it down.
this is...
this is outrageous.
so you recognize what Tolcher was doing?
he took my nanoparticle drug delivery system and weaponized it.
how did he get this?
the people he's working with have eyes everywhere.
so someone's spying on my lab?
possibly. More importantly, is there a way to counter the nanotoxin?
I don't know. Maybe.
nanocells are designed to mimic human tissue, so they can't survive without a live host for more than 20 minutes.
doctor, yes or no?
Yes. Yes, if I had a live, infected subject to work with.
well, you've got one.
these tunnels are classified.
how did you get access?
I'm a covert operative for Commander Evan Danforth.
he told me to use them.
commander Danforth is dead.
I know.
but my mission is still active.
I couldn't risk being seen going through a public route.
I have very important intel for the President.
regarding what?
for her ears only.
we'll check out your story.
I'm going to need supplies.
we have a lab ready to go.
why can't I just work here?
security could be an issue.
well done.
so Dr. Tolcher had you infect Kang with the nanotoxin?
Yes, sir.
a failsafe in case Kang ever discovered that we had been hacking his research.
excellent foresight.
let's--let's keep this between us, shall we?
Amanda might feel compelled to do something rash in response to this action, which wouldn't be prudent for anybody.
of course.
come with us. - Where are we going?
uncuff her.
return to your posts.
sir, we really should stay with
I said, dismissed.
I've cleared agents from the blue sector for the next ten minutes.
I can get you as far as the Oval Office.
you'll need this.
how much did Amanda pay you to betray your country? - I don't work for Amanda.
but the people I do work for want to make sure she gets what she needs, and this has nothing to do with money.
then why are you doing this?
be a good girl and take the gun.
I told you, Nikita,
I know all about how valuable it is to have the right friends.
then why not have him do the job?
do you really need to ask?
you're the one who has to suffer, so you're the one who has to take the fall for this.
now, no more excuses or unforeseen problems, because I've thought of everything.
Birkhoff, do you have a read on Nikita's position?
just give me a sec.
if I'm not careful, Amanda's going to figure out she's on a party line.
you find the Doc?
he's dead. Where is she?
just outside the oval. - Can you patch me in to Nikita over Amanda's command - without Amanda hearing? - Are you nuts?
if Nikita's signal drops out now, Amanda's definitely going to know something's up.
I just need a few seconds. Can you do it?
technically, yes-- - Then do it.
single shot to the head. Make it count.
ms. Mason, you can go in now.
thank you.
what are you doing here, and how the hell did you get on my schedule?
there's something I have to do.
I've settled everything with Fletcher.
you have no more obligation to me or the government.
this is about saving someone.
have you ever had to decide between two impossible choices?
of course.
but if you step back, you'll usually see that one is more important than the other.
Nikita, can you hear me?
Michael? - What?
it's okay. Amanda can't hear us.
do you have the antidote?
have you lost your mind?
okay, look, I-I don't have a lot of time, so
Michael, do you have the antidote?
tell her.
we don't have it.
Yes. We have it.
the threat's been neutralized. You can abort.
Oh, thank God.
I love you.
I love you, too.
there's something you need to know.
there are people trying to kill you.
a lot of people are trying to kill me.
I'm the President of the United States.
I'm talking about your inner circle.
one of your Secret Service gave me this to kill you, to take you out.
that's from my security?
Yes, it is.
I know who, but there could be more.
do you understand what I'm telling you?
do you know what you have to do?
I know exactly what I have to do.
get trauma down here now.
eagle is down. Eagle is down.
eagle is down.
I told you...
I've thought of everything.
eagle is down. - Lock down castle.
alert the M. U. Eagle is down. We need a trauma unit.
get the Vice President to the bunker.
initiate priority security protocol.
put it locked on.
use the tunnels. No eyes. Go. Go.
please tell me that didn't just happen.
it happened. It--it really happened.
the President is dead.
and somehow, Amanda was responsible for it.
this was all a trap to frame Nikita.
it was a contingency.
Amanda made sure Nikita would go down for the assassination even if Nikita couldn't pull the trigger.
the game was rigged all along.
but how?
could she have gotten in Spencer's head?
somehow gotten her in her chair?
Oh, how would she gain that kind of access?
and if she did, why not kill the President then?
guys, this is the Shop we're talking about.
it's got to be some kind of
none of this matters.
what matters is we have to save Nikita.
the Secret Service is going to be all over her by now.
that's if they haven't already dropped her in the deepest hole they got.
where are you going?
getting her out.
Michael, you're at risk-- - Screw that.
look, Michael, we will rescue Nikita, but you can't do anything if you're dead.
I'm dead already. Kang is gone, as is any chance of me getting an antidote.
and I'll be damned if I stand around while Nikita's in trouble.
wait, you're not dead yet.
look, I've been thinking, Kang said that the nanocells react just like living tissue.
they die when the host body dies.
so?
so what if the host body dies?
I get it.
we kill Mikey, we kill the nanocells.
then we revive him.
it's what Amanda did to me to deactivate my kill chip.
we don't have that time.
you remember what Nikita said?
to save her, you have to save yourself.
what's that? - It's to lower your body temperature.
we have to stop your heart for 20 minutes.
that's how long Kang said it takes to kill the nanocells.
the only way to prevent brain damage is to induce hypothermia.
preventing brain damage would be good.
you're trying to figure out why I did it this way, aren't you?
see, my associates needed the President dead, but they also needed a specific narrative.
so I gave them an assassin with an axe to grind.
from now until the end of history, every man, woman, and child will know your name.
booth, Oswald...Nikita.
you know, it's funny, I'm the only one who hasn't gone through this.
all of you have already done this resurrection thing.
well, it's about time you joined the club.
your story's not going to hold up.
you're right.
your testimony could confuse matters, which is why I can't allow you to speak to anyone, ever.
stand down.
there's been a change in orders.
sir?
return to castle. The suspect's coming with me.
no, stop. Don't listen to him.
sir, the protocol is very clear.
we're changing the protocol.
now turn her over. That's an order.
he's working with the people who killed the President.
agent, you've lost control of your prisoner.
will you shut her up?
this is Stirling.
I have control of the situation.
all agents stand down. All agents down. - Wait a minute.
he's on Amanda's frequency.
I might be able to overload the relay.
make it look like she got loose and killed the others, but not before they fatally shot her first.
Thanks, Birkhoff.
listen, whatever you guys are going to do, do it fast, because Amanda is definitely going to be on to us now.
welcome to Division.
start the clock.
Stirling, report in.
send the kill signal, and trigger the nanotoxin now.
Birkhoff, how is he?
he's--he's dead, but, not the way you think.
we had to flatline him to kill the nanotoxin.
what? What about the antidote?
they, uh, they never got it.
it's okay, though. Alex is on top of it.
20 minutes, and they're going to bring him back.
I'm on my way. Birkhoff, listen to me.
don't let him die. Do you understand?
don't you dare let him die.
we sent out a signal but never got a valid response.
the nanotoxin was never activated.
there's a group of gentlemen I hired for quite a bit of money recently.
former employees, actually. They're on standby.
I'd like you to tell them it's time to go to work.
what orders shall I give them?
tell them to return to Division and wipe everyone out.
one, two, three, four, five.

everybody, we've got bad guys on the way down.
you guys go.
I'll stay with Michael.
it's Okay. Go. - OKay.
who are they? - I caught a couple faces.
dirty 30s are attacking us?
Amanda. She's got Shop money now.
she can afford them.
let's get them away from medical.
fall back!
how you like me now?
clear!
I'm out.
me too.
I got three rounds.
make them count.
draw them up top.
we'll flank them.
I got something I want to say.
I never liked you guys.
well, then, you got nothing to lose.
we'll be fine. Go.
go.
he's been down for so long.
I don't know if his body's strong enough.
all right. Okay.
he's strong enough. Come on, Michael.
give him the adrenaline. Now.
do you remember when I told you that you were the strongest person I'd ever met?
we were standing in the snow.
we'd just gotten Kasim, and you told me about the life he took from you.
and I thought, how could anyone survive that?
you did.
you did.
and then you saved me, too.
Michael, you pulled me out of the darkness when there was no other way.
and I need you to be strong for me right now.
if you want to save me...
save yourself.
please.
all of you went through that?
manhunt
as the nation continues to mourn President Spencer's death, the country's law enforcement agencies have launched the largest manhunt in history as they begin the search for the assassin.
the Secret Service has released the following description.
female, dark hair, roughly 5'7."
they've also released an image, taken from security camera footage within the White House.
the image is grainy, but take a close look.
if you have any information regarding this person, you are asked to contact local authorities.
we're going to clear your name.
no question. They got nothing.
that could be Bigfoot.
they'll find a better image.
we'll expose the truth before that happens.
the problem will be getting people to believe it.
I know the truth, and I can hardly believe it.
that's why we need to get to the bottom of what's really going on...
find out why Amanda and the group wanted the President dead, how they made her commit suicide.
those answers are what's going to clear Nikita's name.
we'll need somewhere to work from.
do you think maybe you could convince your hacker buddies to let us use this place for a while?
we're going to need a safehouse, since we lost those presidential pardons.
I'm putting you all in the line of fire.
we can handle it.
no. This will be heat like we've never seen before.
bring it on.
Nikita, we can beat this.
I was ready to die today, but you and Alex and everyone refused to let that happen.
you remember when Amanda tried to teach us that our loved ones were a liability?
well, it's a good thing you've got more than one.
okay.
till death do us part, right?
a toast to a successful beginning.
Nikita's still alive.
we tend not to view these things as zero-sum games.
what needed to happen happened.
the President is dead.
at least, to the outside world.
you should know that I am worthless as a hostage.
the United States will not negotiate with terrorists.
typical of an American to think she's being held as some type of leverage.
it is understandable.
grabbing her, as you did, at the G20, she probably suspects some foreign enemy.
it could all come crashing down because of Nikita.
we could release a clearer image, make sure people know who they're chasing.
no, meddling now would raise too many questions.
remember, we are the Invisible Hand.
Nikita has a habit of chopping off hands.
then we shall grow another.
these are all Shop facilities.
Yup. - A lot of these locations correspond to known hubs for human trafficking.
maryam Hasan offered me a position at the U. N. to work on the global trafficking problem.
if I took it, I'd have the influence and cover to get us into a lot of these places.
you want to be a diplomat?
it'd be a chance for Alexandra Udinov to do some good.
make the name into something that I could finally be proud of.
and it'll help us nail the people working with Amanda and get us closer to clearing Nikita's name.
that's not a bad strategy.
she was right here.
come on, Nikita.
answer your damn phone.
answer, damn it.
answer your phone.
don't be late. - Yes, sir, sergeant sir.
sorry I'm late. They keep changing scheduling in here.
they do that. I'll be quick.
I need you on sentry duty for the next 3 days.
I'm about to raise a little hell out there, And I need you to tell me when division responds.
got it. What are you gonna do?
something I should have done a long time ago.
be ready.
sorry. - No worries.
you're pretty good at that. - Thanks.
you look just like your dad.
you knew my dad?
thank you.
Lisa, don't move.
Oh, God. Please don't hurt us.
that would be a mistake.
since when do you own a gun?
since you killed my husband.
relax your hand.
if I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.
your husband, Victor, he was a good man.
what did he tell you about his work with homeland security?
his work was classified. He never told any...
he was trying to take down the red circle triad.
they deal in slave labor for some of the major fashion houses.
6 years after his death, their business is booming.
that's why I'm here, Lisa.
I'm going after the triad.
but you work for the triad. - No...
but I believe they hired the people I used to work for.
they used me to get close to your to gain your trust.
well, that worked, didn't it?
I didn't have a choice 6 years ago. I do now.
I'm going to bring down the bosses who called the hit,
but I can't do that until I know you're safe.
you're going to take that car.
you and Sophie. You're gonna drive it upstate to a Lake house.
you're gonna stay there till you get my call.
no. No way.
listen to me.
once I go after these people, They are going to come looking for you.
the only way to be safe is to take that car
and drive to the address on the navigation system.
Lisa, I'm not asking for your forgiveness.
I'm asking you to protect your daughter.
well, that's what we agreed.
you know, I don't care.
talk them down, or I'm pulling the line.
sandy, call wholesale and make sure they get that price.
ms. Wiles . Roxanne Barnes. I'm the buyer from midland.
Midland. I thought you were coming next week.
I know. Our schedule got shifted.
I hope it's OK.
and I just want to get it out of the way...
personally, I'm a huge fan.
Ah, so, you're here to put all my clothes
beside lawn mowers and shotguns all across America.
the world, actually.
we have 3, 600 stores. Beautiful.
the quality's amazing, considering where it's made.
excuse me?
Oh, Ms. Wiles, midland has no problem keeping costs down.
your secret is safe with us.
I'm sorry. I'm not following you.
Oh, well, I've got samples. Maybe this will help.
here we are.
what is this?
it's just 63 people who were going to be your employees.
port authority found them last week, suffocated.
a tragic accident of human smuggling.
your clothes are all made in sweatshops.
the red circle triad?
they provide your slave labor, don't they?
who are you?
somebody who would never buy your crap.
tell me where the sweatshop is.
you've had your lawyers running interference on this,
so I know you know where it is.
tell me. - Get out of my... ohh!
you scream, and I will snap your neck.
not so glamorous, is it, feeling powerless?
now be a good slave
and give me the address.
good morning.
as you are called upon for field work, you can count on one thing...
you'll be asked to perform highly involved tasks in exigent situations.
what we like to call grace under fire.
you've all been schooled in basic ied interdiction,
but can you do it in a pinch?
there's a bomb under this car.
you have 30 seconds.
who wants to go first?
Alex, you're up.
and begin.
I can't move.
get me out of here.
stop!
get me out of here!
it's OK. It's OK.
it's all right. It's all right.
I got this. - It doesn't look like it.
what, are you checking up on me?
not at all.
you're wanted in operations.
she ided herself as Roxanne Barnes.
that's the name of an actual fashion buyer
apparently Nikita broke this lady's wrist.
she's pissed off about something.
so what does Tonya wiles do?
you mean besides providestylish ready-to-wear fashion
here's a flag.
she was questioned last year by customs
about a forced labor scam run by the red circle triad.
everybody lawyered up. It went nowhere.
she's going back to her first mission.
her first kill.
got a bead on her yet?
well, she took on Tonya in Manhattan.
uh, 27th street fashion district.
am I missing something here?
why would Nikita follow up on a kill she made 6 years ago?
the case is way closed.
maybe she's re-opening it.
Nikita, have a moment?
I've been down here a year.
I got nothing but moments.
good,'cause I'm on a schedule.
what have you got behind your back?
nothing.
I may just have to fight you for it.
you scared?
terrified. - Well, OK.
one arm behind my back?
it's your funeral.
Ohh! Michael.
want to even the odds?
that was pretty good.
that's the big secret?
a key card?
it's your ticket to the outside world.
you've been activated for your first op.
I get to leave?
no, the activation's provisional.
you have to come right back here after you complete the assignment.
like a learner's permit.
but you have to see Amanda first.
such a tease.
don't attack so hard.
I thought that was the point.
Kobudo's about defense.
if all you do is thrash at your opponent, you're gonna get nailed.
you still haven't let go of what happened this morning, huh?
Hey, where you going?
I gotta go to the computer lab.
right now?
2 out of 3 after lunch?
Yeah, I'm there.
Amanda would like to see you.
Yeah, I gotta go... - now.
what do I always say about preparation?
it's the key to success.
your first provisional assignment.
it's a big step.
please don't say,"you're a woman now.
well, you have grown up over the last year.
I take some measure of pride in that.
the truth is, you've earned our trust.
what is my first assignment?
just remember.
trust is not something you win.
it's something you build.
and that's your assignment...
to build a trust so powerful that it would make someone welcome you into their family.
family?
congratulations, Nikita.
your references are stellar.
I can see why my wife wants to hire you.
Oh, it's not just that, Victor. It's Sophie.
she likes Nikita. I can tell already.
honey. - Oh, sorry.
no one said this thing was going to take over my life.
sentry 1 to sentry 2, front yard is clear.
what is it you do, Mr. Han?
I work for this new agency called homeland security.
bush just created a new, uh, cabinet post for it.
you work for the government?
Yes.
and I've got a few enemies already.
stop asking him questions.
you're supposed to be gaining their confidence, not blowing it.
if you feel uncomfortable, Nikita...
no, I just...
I didn't know this is what I'd signed up for.
complete the mission.
OK, then...
it's fine.
I was an Au pair for an expat family in Shanghai.
they had all kinds of armed guards around.
then we're good.
you'll be safe, and so will my little girl,
as long as we keep her away from peanut products.
no, that's your thing, honey.
we don't know that princess is gonna have
the same little peanut allergy as daddy, do we?
welcome to the family, Nikita.
I gotta go. Protect the homeland or whatever.
I was hoping not to use that.
this is pointless.
I had a freak-out. So what?
you had a panic attack, Alex.
an involuntary reaction. To what, I'm not sure.
let's talk about it.
I'm fine.
I've seen this a thousand times, Alex,
especially with new arrivals.
we take you in, turn you into something new,
even better than you were before.
but there's always something you can't let go of.
what triggered the attack, Alex?
what was going through your mind?
you really want to know?
it's this place.
it reminds me of how I used to live.
how I was forced to live.
when you were held by the Russians.
why don't we just say it?
when I was a sex slave.
they locked me in a hole and woke me when it was time to perform.
at least they had the decency to keep me high the whole time.
you make a good point.
and you're obviously suffering from post-traumatic stress.
here. Let me help you.
there. Happy? I feel better already.
we still need to work on your manners.
sorry to ruin the whole day-spa vibe you've got going in here,
but I don't need your help.
Alex, you don't have a choice.
OK, so what is this place?
headquarters for the red circle triad in New York.
nothing much going on right now, But at night it turns into a pretty happenin' spot.
lady gaga was there last Friday.
that's great. Where's the boss?
name is Chen lo, according to the Intel group.
he runs the business from a back room in the northeast corner.
give me a second.
OK, I got eyes inside.
see for yourself. The guy in the suit is Chen lo.
you catching that?
Yeah, congratulations.
looks like Nikita hit the sweatshop,
but she let the sweatshop boss get away.
let him get away?
that's not in her DNA.
exactly. Run a scan.
see if you can snag any wideband Rf transmissions.
got a signal coming from that room.
she put a tracker on the sweatshop boss so she could follow him to Chen lo.
crafty.
she have to be nearby to track it?
no. Military-grade transmitter.
she could be anywhere in the city.
man, Nikki's all hard-core about this, huh?
kinda crazy how she's going back to her greatest hits,
no pun.
just have the team on standby, all right?
Nikita, I'm gonna head out to the farmer's market.
I want to get some stuff for dinner. You good?
Yes, we are, mama. Yes, we are!
we're very, very good.
I thought so. I'll be back.
Bye-bye.
we'll be here.
Bye-bye, mama.
take the baby for a walk.
of course, my husband can't come.
just had to work on Sunday.
Hey, I'm trying to protect an entire nation.
it's gorgeous out.
I think I'm gonna take her for a walk.
good idea.
don't want the hubby home alone with the young nanny.
Oh, all right.
you just may have to pay for that.
just make sure to take one of the guys with you, Nikita.
that's good. Keep walking.
give me the baby.
what do you want with a baby?
give me the baby now.
I'm not giving her to you. Or to him.
we're not going to hurt her, Nikita.
this is roan.
standby for abort and clean.
do not get ahead of yourself, do you hear me?
control your asset, or I will.
Sophie will be returned to her mother.
we have orders to not hurt them.
so Victor Han is the target.
why does he have to die?
look, if you don't do this, division will call a clean.
that means they clean everything and everyone, including you and that child.
and there's not a damned thing I can do about it.
you got that?
we don't have a choice. Give me the child.
put the device in the crib, arm it and leave.
Hey, hey, hey.
she asleep?
out like a light.
I'm gonna go enjoy some more of the day.
go for it.
Nikita. Thank you.
I don't know what we'd do without you.
clear.
Alex, where are you?
do you like it?
it's part of our spring collection.
get this off of me.
it's not up to me. It's up to you.
the jacket has an electronic lock which is synchronized
with the heart rate monitor around your chest.
if you can bring your pulse down to 51 beats per minute,
the lock will release.
you panicked during a simple exercise, Alex.
division won't tolerate that kind of physical liability in a recruit.
you have to prove you can pass this test,
or it may be your last.
I got nothing.
Birkhoff, anything?
no, but I like this channel.
keep your eyes on the models.
you know how she likes to dress up.
I should have known.
when they told me some crazy bitch burned down my factory, I wasn't sure.
all these years, I thought I killed you.
you were triad.
well, like they say...
no, you couldn't have pulled this off on your own.
and homeland wouldn't have stood for it.
you made a deal with Percy.
that's why we faked your death.
he's gonna get an earful from me after today.
how could you?
you had a wife and a daughter.
the insurance took care of them, Nikita.
everyone came out a winner...
except you.
in a matter of seconds, you're going to be surrounded.
what do you think you're doing?
I hate chatting online.
let's do this face-to-face.
it's bulletproof.
so you gonna take down the triads now? Is that it?
it was just gonna be their man in New York.
then I found out Victor Han is their boss.
what?
you don't know.
Victor Han is alive, Michael.
of course you don't know.
you never asked.
you probably don't even know why he was a targeted.
he had to be dirty.
Oh, he was.
he was a double Agent for the triads.
he got a big fat promotion thanks to Percy's bait-and-switch.
not for long.
I need a location on Victor Han in Hong Kong.
who've you been talking to?
no, let me guess.
What'd she say?
how could Percy do such a thing, Michael?
make a deal with a criminal?
you want to know how?
I assume you had your reasons.
and you knew never to ask.
I always loved that about you.
did the right thing, Michael.
the government came to me with a serious situation.
a triad double Agent had worked his way so high up into homeland security,
he was attending NSC briefings at the West wing.
now, maybe you don't recall,
but this was 2 years after 911.
homeland was brand new.
do you have any idea what would have happened if that information had gone public?
it would destroy their agency.
the government came to us with a problem, and we solved it.
making him into a martyr was my idea.
Yeah, but to keep him alive. Why?
wouldn't want any blowback from the triads.
of course, you didn't take any money from them, either.
you better get going.
I'll text you Han's address.
Nikita's probably on her way to Hong Kong as we speak.
madam, don't you think you should have declared these
before returning to Hong Kong?
hmm. Yes, I was.
I was going to. I'm sorry.
is this the part where you tie me up?
listen, I will pay the fine. It's fine. It's totally fine.
I just... I don't want to go back in that line out there
because it's a little long,
and isn't there a side door or something I could go through?
certainly. - There you go.
something wrong?
no, I just didn't know we had company.
51 beats per minute. Then you'll be free.
face the flame.
breathe in through the nose, exhale through the mouth.
without blowing it out.
tell me about your pain, Alex.
it's the only way to let it go.
maybe I like my pain.
there was a girl who used to say the same thing.
turned out to be one of our best.
but she didn't become great until she set herself free.
by confronting her deepest, deepest fears.
I was 13.
I was with my parents.
we were driving.
there was an accident, and we fell into the River.
we were sinking.
and there was so much...
water.
my papa lost control.
I tried to scream, but I couldn't.
my parents died in that car accident.
and you people put me under that car.
I'm proud of you, Alex.
you really do remind me of Nikita.
you flew all the way out here for me.
that is just simply stupid.
I just had to see you again.
I spoke with Percy.
it's funny.
he didn't want to get into it.
Percy's not really a talker.
that's OK, I worked it out.
so you went and grew a conscience, Nikita?
now you're a thorn in Percy's side 'cause you think you can, what?
make a difference in the world?
you in prison being man-raped.
that'd be different.
you're going to tell me who knows about this.
did you tell Lisa and Sophie?
Oh, you remember their names.
don't get sanctimonious.
you know all about living a lie, Nikita.
Victor Han was a name I created to infiltrate homeland.
as for the wife and kid,
they were just my cover.
they were your family.
I have a family, here.
a wife and two children, and I want to keep it that way.
I'm not really a talker, either.
that's OK.
my boys here got a few power tools to help bring you out of your Shell.
you think you're gonna break me?
nobody likes a crusader, Nikita.
I tried it for a few months. I got blown up.
I can't believe I ever thought you were cute.
I can't believe I never had my way with you.
you couldn't handle me.
not then, not now.
the nice thing about the slave business
is that I can handle anything I want.
honestly, I think we would clash.
sort of like lipstick and peanut oil.
Please...Please.
shut up before I change my mind.
Victor Han, a former high-ranking official
in the United States department of homeland security,
a man thought to be dead,
found on the steps of the police department, Bound and gagged.
apparently left there by an unknown crusader.
no, it's not going to be a problem.
it's going to be an opportunity.
for who? For you.
Yeah. No, no.
easy, easy.
look, we both agree Victor was sloppy.
but you... you could take over the operation, couldn't you?
no, you're right. No... no commission.
for the time being.
when they returned her to me...
the people you used to work for...
they threatened me.
told me not to talk.
who knew her own father was behind it?
he'll pay for what he did.
I decided I'm not going to tell her.
as far as I'm concerned, Victor died that day.
you said you didn't want forgiveness,
but you deserve it, Nikita.
at least from me.
thank you.
the people who made you do this, can you ever stop them?
it's going to take some time.
what else you got?
pulse never broke 60.
damn, girl. What'd Amanda do to you?
I don't know. We just, uh, talked.
guess it worked.
Yeah, well, wait till I get under there.
thanks for pulling me out the first time.
you would have worked it out eventually.
I mean it, Thom.
so, uh, didn't you say 2 out of 3 with the Bo staff?
I did, didn't I?
you really want to get your ass kicked by a girl?
girls get no mercy.
that's the first rule of kobudo.
yeah? What's the second?
so how'd you do it?
I'm not done.
what do you mean?
she's hiding something.
sorry I missed you earlier. Got caught up.
how'd it go on your end?
you're supposed to be in logistics.
just tell me, straight.
why did we have to kill an innocent man?
one that works for our own government?
we don't ask questions.
you'd follow him over a cliff, wouldn't you?
just like that.
Percy gave you a gift.
he gave you a second chance.
he can have it back.
you don't have a choice.
what about you, Michael?
do you have a choice?
grow up.
why are you so loyal to Percy?
Why?
because I owe him my life.
6 years ago, I was taken from prison and forced to become an assassin for a secret unit of the government.
a black ops program called Division that has now gone rogue.
they destroyed my identity and they destroyed the man I loved.
I escaped, and now the man that trained me, someone I trusted, is hunting me.
what division doesn't know is that I have a partner on the inside
Alex. A new recruit with a dark past who I've trained in secret to resist their control.
together we're going to take Division apart one mission at a time.
and the last word they'll breathe before the end will be my name.
in here, sir.
take your time. I'll be right outside if you need me.
everyone down!
this is a robbery!
everyone down! Get down!
get down! Get down!
you stay down!
damn it!
shut up!
we're going for a walk.
wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.
take me.
I'm a better shield.
get your ass on the floor.
now!
we've isolated the Wahabbist terror cell from Pakistan.
all strike teams have entered the theater.
we've got 5 heartbeats grouped in the northwest corner.
snipers have visual confirmation on
hasan and 4 bodyguards.
bring us to green.
Percy.
guardian Canada one.
unsecured.
go. Secure.
the package is out in the open.
has it been compromised?
no.
the data update was interrupted.
I've taken a wound from local authorities.
they're looking for me.
how the hell did this happen? What--don't answer that.
just find cover and go quiet.
I'm coming to you.
re-dial this number precisely at 16: 00.
alpha and bravo teams in position.
I need to be in Montreal in 2 hours. - What?
first available flight.
got a commercial jet leaving out of JKF at 11: 00.
not good enough.
we're in the middle of an operation-- in Pakistan!
only other thing is a military cargo transport taking off from Mcguire in half an hour.
get me on it.
all right. Don't expect bloody marys and peanuts.
what the hell's in Montreal?
so what the hell's in Montreal?
keep your voice down. - 3 weeks.
that's how long it took to plan this mission.
it's too important to screw up.
good thing I'm leaving you in charge, then.
so what's in Montreal?
something I need to take care of.
something more important than Division?
I am Division.
Percy's on the move to Montreal.
Percy never goes into the field.
pretty sure he takes his vacations in logistics.
well, he's gone. He and Michael went at it, then he bolted.
the grown-ups were fighting?
right in front of the kids.
so something got his attention in Montreal.
Percy's rattled.
that's not like him.
unless it's Nikita.
he wouldn't go alone if it was her.
why hide it from us? It's gotta be something else.
is there any flash traffic from Canada?
Nope. Zilch-o.
does the CIA have a station there?
in Montreal? Yeah.
they're monitoring the world's most polite terrorists.
give me the news feeds.
are you sure you want to get all up in Percy's bidness?
Montreal.
there's a...
labor strike in an oil refinery.
the Canadiens want to trade for a defenseman.
some bystander went all robocop at a bank robbery this morning.
stop.
pull that last one up.
laid down suppressing fire.
definitely a professional,
possibly military trained.
we're extremely fortunate to just come away with injuries.
the suspects who robbed the bank weren't so lucky.
he created chokepoints here and here.
there's no chance of pursuit. That's our S. O.P.
he's Division.
I was about to thank the man for saving my daughter's life, and then he just marches out the door and starts firing.
that bugger moved so fast, it was like he was a superhero or something.
bank officials say the man in question, who had come in to check out a safety deposit box, is a landscaper from Saint-Henri.
authorities are already searching his apartment.
he has been identified as Owen Elliot.
he is still at large and considered extremely dangerous.
no Owen Elliot on personnel or noc lists.
that's 'cause he's off-book.
the only reason he surfaced is 'cause something went wrong.
I go rogue, Percy sics Michael on me.
you get his personal attention.
ecole St. Julien Le Pauvre
I'm sorry, Miss, this area's an active crime scene.
chill, CSI. I'm not a reporter.
I'm just going to see my friend.
is that legal?
thank you.
no, no, no, no. Wednesday's not going to work.
I sent you the schedule and I specifically said
hang on. Hi.
how much for the glass pieces?
sorry?
the stained glass in the window.
it's handmade, right?
my boss saw them, and now he has to have them for this lobby we're redesigning.
do you have a contractor discount?
sorry, they're not for sale.
please, hang on one second.
listen, let me call you back, ok?
listen, I'm really sorry, but if I go back empty-handed, my boss is gonna kill me.
please. Please, please, please, please, please.
let me, uh, see what I can part with.
Thanks.
you're saving my life.
I really just make them for myself, but I think I've got a few I can spare.
so you're a designer?
well, no, my boss is.
what's all the commotion next door?
I just got home.
is it that guy from the news?
I knew I recognized this neighborhood.
did you know him? - Not really.
He...kept to himself.
wow, that's beautiful.
Oh, ha. These really aren't my best, but...
they're perfect. Thank you.
how much? - Oh, it's ok.
consider them professional samples.
Really?
you rock.
he's going to love 'em. Thank you.
how can I help you? - Hi.
my husband, the idiot, he lost his phone and, um, he can't remember where he put it, of course.
and I was talking to a friend of mine and he said that you guys can find cell phones now using gps or cell towers or something computer-y like that.
account holder's name?
Owen Elliot.
account number?
password?
I can't release the information without the password.
right.
listen...
I'm not actually looking for the cell phone.
I'm looking for the cheating bastard attached to the cell phone.
the password is probably the slut's name.
Bambi or Chloe or Jenee with two es.
the man could not keep it in his pants if it was tied to a zipper,
do you know what I'm saying?
girl, you're preaching to the choir.
just hold on a minute.

hands. Put 'em up slowly.
good place to hide.
school gone to hell.
remind you of division any?
is that what you got from the bank?
Percy send you? - Hello?
gun. Means question time's for me.
though I am here because of Percy.
that's one of his black boxes, isn't it?
see for yourself.
where did you get that butterfly?
Hey, listen
what did you to her?
she didn't compromise the mission, the box is secure!
what did you do with Emily?!
I'm... not division.
who are you?
you're early. What went wrong?
my position was blown.
an operative made a play for the package.
it's still secure but you may want to move up your timetable.
female, 5 foot 6?
who is she?
Nikita. A rogue agent.
how come I wasn't briefed?
briefed?
Owen, what did she say to you? - Nothing.
she wanted to know who I was.
I was able to get the drop on her.
but you let her live. - I had a choice
either pursue her or protect the package.
now my mission is
to protect the box. You made the right choice.
location alpha, one hour.
I'll meet you there myself.
and if you see Nikita again, you're to terminate on sight.
I'll take care of her. - No.
for once, she's not the priority.
take your men and secure the rendezvous point.
and Roan, once the delivery's been made,
I want complete containment.
you want me to cancel the courier.
he's had advanced training, so be ready.

thom.
call me.
I don't have your number.
I think you do.
Wow. Snappy banter.
you should write for reality TV.
has it really been that long since you've had sex?
at least some of us have had sex.
What'd you say?
nothing, sir.
uh, sorry, how do you put this into pairing mode again?
Thanks.
I can't stand that guy.
Yeah, me, neither.
just don't let him know that.
Owen called you, didn't he?
what are you doing here?
told you to leave work early.
that he'd talk to you when he saw you.
I'm calling the police.
they're gonna kill him, Emily.
not the police.
the people he works for;
people I used to work for.
Owen's a landscaper.
you still believe that?
he told me not to believe the news.
he's not the man they're describing.
he's...
he's shy.
he didn't even talk to me the first year he was here.
why would anyone want to kill him?
because he made a mistake.
several, actually, starting with you.
what?
most people want to make a connection.
they want to feel safe.
they want to feel loved.
in Owen's line of work, those feelings get you killed.
they're what got my fiance killed.
I don't want to see it happen again.
are you criminals?
it's a little more complicated than that.
he lied to protect you, but he can't do it anymore.
why should I believe you?
because I've been through it.
I am the only one who can save Owen.
all positions, do you see the target?
this is 4. Target acquired.
I repeat, target acquired.
600 meters.
Emily.
we need to talk.
what's he doing?
Where's Emily? - She's safe.
where is she?
we're at her place. She's fine.
but she won't be if you give Percy that box.
I'm going to kill you.
what is he doing?!
stop him!
all positions green light, take him down.
he's out of range.
what happened?
he's on his way.
this isn't cool, man.
you punched in a clean code, right?
Yeah. But what are we doing here?
we can't close the books on backhoe without command level sign-off. We need percy for that,
but I need details on his current mission before contacting him.
OK, cool.
and what are we really doing here?
well, let's put it this way, Birkhoff-- you can either help me
or I can tell percy what you've been doing
after hours in the video conference room.
with the girls in Amsterdam.
Owen Elliot?
Owen Elliot.
got a hit.
Percy's got him under a privileged NOC file.
what's his assignment?
landscaper. Dude's a freakin' gardener.
that's nowhere near a standard issue cover.
doesn't even give him legitimate excuses to travel.
check this out
his designation, Guardian.
never heard of that, have you?
no.
he's got cleaner-level training.
dude's a bad ass.
he's also checked out on some hardware I've never heard of.
serial number BB-4905.
so that's what you're there for.
what's what you're there for?
Michael?
what's what you're there for?
we need to talk.
she's safe, Owen.
where is she?
I'm not your enemy.
where is she?
Owen.
Hey. Come here.
wait.
what do you want?
I want the black box, and I want to help you escape from Division, with Emily.
Why?
why did you save that little girl?
at the bank? You could have waited out the crisis;
figured out an exit.
it's what your training tells you to do.
but you didn't.
you acted differently because it was the right thing to do.
thanks to Emily, you know how that feels.
leave her out of this.
she's in this, Owen. We all are.
do you even know what that black box is?
that hard drive contains evidence of every job Division's ever done.
all the nation's dirty laundry, and more.
as long as Percy has it, he is untouchable.
it's been his leverage against the people who put him in power.
that is why I need to destroy it
because it is the right thing to do.
is what she's saying true?
I don't know.
because Percy doesn't want you to know.
you have only one way to be sure.
Where's the black box?
what the hell were you doing, huh?
nothing. Just having some fun.
having some fun?
by breaking into Percy's office?
you want to put a gun to your head, fine.
it was nice knowing you.
I thought I could find my file.
your file?
don't you ever wonder, Thom?
why we're here?
you know why we're here, Alex.
I don't mean what they're training us for.
I mean, why us?
why me?
what is it that they saw?
what made them say, she's not such a waste of space.
that she's someone worth saving.
I have questions, too.
we all do.
but what you did was reckless.
you put me in a bad position.
you pull something like that again, and I'll be forced to turn you in.
you buried it.
like in the ground? Where?
you first.
how'd you escape Division?
how'd you remove your tracker?
I will tell you. Not now.
we don't have...
no, no, no, no!
Hey. Honey ，look at me. Look at me.
Emily.
she's gone, Owen, we gotta go.
Owen! Go!
Owen! Go!
where is it, Owen?
you took something that was mine;
something I entrusted you with.
and I want it back.
you know how this is going to turn out.
eventually your brain will cease to be able to distinguish between reality and hallucination, and you will cough up the location.
it's inevitable.
I'm just curious
what did she tell you?
that Division is an evil empire and I'm the big bad wolf?
she had a problem with her kidneys.
one day she collapsed in the hallway.
so I picked her up and brought her to dialysis.
and the next week and the week after.
her name was Emily.
Robinson.
you took something of mine, too.
I'm telling you, man, this isn't good. Not good.
I thought you said we got in clean.
we did! But, I don't know, I must have missed something, because these security logs clearly have me entering Percy's office.
OK, so we'll explain it to him.
I can make the case that it was legitimate division business.
easy for you to say, teacher's pet.
me? Whipping boy.
so what do you want me to do?
sir? You've got a call.
Percy? - Nikita.
thanks again for helping me with that phone hack.
what? Whatever.
no, the workaround you figured out was genius.
Yeah, yeah, I'm very brilliant. Now move.
Birkhoff, get a trace on this.
this is Michael.
Hello, Michael.
Oh, Nikita. Where are you?
Fiji. I needed some R&R.
definitely North America.
Yeah, I hear Nadi is lovely this time of year.
it's pretty humid.
I wish I could chat, but this isn't a social call.
I need to speak with Percy.
he's indisposed.
find him.
damn, she spoofed the tower pings.
switching to satellite tracking.
go ahead and patch her through to Percy.
Percy.
Hello, Percy.
Nikita.
your ears must have been burning.
just talking about you with your boyfriend here.
how is he?
he's been better.
what do you want?
what do I want?
what I want is to empty a clip into your face.
Yeah, well, we both know that's not going to happen,
right? I mean, unless you plan to do irreparable damage to the country.
Yeah, yeah, you're protected. For now.
what I want today is a trade.
you give me Owen, I give you back your black box.
I know what you did. - What?
you need to work on your sneaky-sneak, Nancy Drew.
you went somewhere you ain't supposed to be.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Thom's room?
I saw you coming out of there.
he was just helping me out with a problem.
Uh-huh.
you doubling down on that?
look, Jaden, you want Thom? He's yours.
just get out of my face.
she's gotta be in Montreal.
Yep. Northeast quadrant.
trace Percy's location, too.
she may be trying to close in on his position.
on it.
what the hell is she doing?
I miss you, Nikita. I really do.
you had the most natural tradecraft instincts of anyone I've ever seen.
no matter what the situation;
no matter how desperate, you always had some gambit, some bluff you could play.
you think I'm bluffing.
I think you're bluffing.
black box serial number BB-4905.
tell me you weren't stupid enough to give the box to Nikita.
you didn't give it to her, did you?
did you?!
is that a bad thing?
shoot him.
do that and you'll never get your box back.
what do you think,
I don't have back-ups?
losing one means nothing to me.
all right, well, in that case,
I'll take a peak inside this one.
I'm sure there's tons of useful information.
maybe even some secrets about you.
you're messing with the wrong weapon.
no.
you made that mistake a long time ago.
circle gets the square. She is 3. 5 miles from Percy's position.
Where's percy?
freighter down by the old docks.
you got yourself a deal.
tomorrow morning.
7:00 a.m, Olympic Stadium, north side.
bring owen. No one else.
agreed.
and you're sure this is what you want?
he's a blip.
a rounding error.
I could kill 'em and no one would notice.
that's the difference between you and me, Percy
you'll kill anyone, at any time.
I don't waste life.
Percy.
we found her location.
she's not far. I could call the local
no. Don't bother. I've got men, I'll send them,
but she'll be long gone.
we'll be ready for her tomorrow.
Thanks.
earlier today, we had a security breach.
someone entered Percy's office without permission.
we're going to find that person.
you step forward now, take responsibility,
and I will personally
put in a word for you.
OK.
where were you at 15: 00?
in my room.
funny, there's no log of that.
in fact,
you were completely off the grid at that point.
not my fault.
anyone here that can vouch for her?
I didn't think so.
Oh, this is bull.
I didn't do anything!
you're trying to set me up,
you think I don't know that?!
Hey! What the hell's going on in here?
Michael, Michael, Michael, listen.
I got us covered here, man, ok?
better one of them take the fall than us.
but we can fix it so it's only a slap on the wrist,
maybe a meal penalty, solitary maximum.
everybody get out.
go.
look, this has nothing to do with the recruits.
I was in Percy's office.
I'll take responsibility. If there's any blowback,
it'll be on me and me alone, you got that?
all positions, check in.
she's here.
clever.
we need to get you off-site, now.
I will take care other things down here.
drop the weapon.
was it worth it?
No! Drop the gun, Owen.
I can't let you kill him.
I want him dead just as much as you do.
just let me do this.
I can't.
you kill him now, those black boxes get out to the world.
innocent people will be hurt.
innocent people like Emily?
Yes, like Emily.
she told me about you.
how you cared for her.
shut up.
you cared about someone, Owen.
remember that. I will help you get through this.
we will destroy the black boxes, and then we'll kill this smug son of a bitch.
do this now, people will die.
there's just one problem.
I don't care.
Hey.
Hey.
still working on that BIOS hack, huh?
you kinda sucked at it in class.
I had it under control. - Right.
so the CPU was supposed to start smoking like that?
well, I was still thinking about the demolitions lesson.
listen, um...
I wanted to...
I didn't get the chance...
I could have dealt with...
you're welcome.
look.
I know what you're going through, all right?
you ask yourself, did they make a mistake, do I really belong here?
but you gotta forget about all that.
this is your second chance at life.
how often do you get a gift like that?
Thanks.
don't.
I got it.
I'm not...
forget about it.
thom.
I'll see you later.
Hey, chief, you wanted to see me?
operation backhoe went well.
the strike team took out Hasan and his men cleanly.
no losses for us.
computer breach?
Yeah, um...
Yeah, that was part of.
that is--there was
a legitimate
you should talk to michael.
it was his call.
they're called division Black ops program that has now gone rogue.
and the man that trained me, someone I trusted,
was hunting me.
I was coming here to double cross you. - Well...You didn't.
you're the strongest person I've ever met.
this is too dangerous.
you're supposed to be working on the assignment.
I got a new one. Bearing you.
I had a dream.
I saw a future for myself with nathan.
I have a chance to get out before it's too late, And I have to take it.
wait...
so you decided... To infiltrate - Yes. But we had a plan.
Yeah, you and this nikita person.
a plan to get back at the people who killed your parents?
Yes. Nathan, please...Just let me say what I have to say.
hear me out. - This is crazy.
Hey, you promised. - I know.
but I thought you were gonna say You were in trouble with the mob or something,
you know, you owed money. Government assassins?
they're government funded, but they've broken away.
they're out of control. - I can't do this.
I shouldn't hear this.
no. You have to!
you're the reason everything's changed. - What?
you're the reason I wanna get out!
I'm getting out, nathan.
Nikita has an escape plan to get me free and clear,
and I have someone on the inside, michael,
who's gonna help fake my death.
why are you telling me all this? - Because I want you to come with me
and you can't decide to do that or not Unless you know the truth.
Nikita has a plan for you too.
I'd go first, And then we'd meet up somewhere in a month or so.
where? - Wherever you want.
greece, brazil.
you said you like the music there.
michael your boss that stopped by for dinner?
he he wasn't on our side then. He is now.
well...
did we?
no.
Alex, hey.
Hey, you all right?
no.
what is it?
come on. You've been tense the last couple of days.
I can't help you if you won't talk about it.
I haven't been honest with you.
and I think it's eating me up inside.
that's gonna end...
right now. Are you ready?
from the second you open your eyes, Nothing but surprises.
that's what I love about you, alex.
it's alexandra.
Hello? - Alex, you need to come in. Immediately.
we're pressed for time,
so you'll go straight from the briefing To tactical review.
after that, birkhoff will meet you in logistics To go over your infiltration kit.
Michael... I thought I was getting out.
Nikita said she told you.
I realize we're on the same team,
but that doesn't mean we speak about it in here...Ever.
I'm sorry. But why are you putting me on a mission?
is it something we're trying to stop?
no. This mission is on the level.
and you're gonna run point. - What?
you're being assigned A provisional agent.
I realize the two of you have had your differences, But thrust me when I tell you
there is no one else for this job.
profiled in last month's vanity fair "the children of power.
kalume's father is the president of liberia,
So...Life is good.
Kalume lives like a prince, parties like a rock star.
if that's all that he did, we wouldn't care.
but kal, as his harvard classmates like to call him, Is also something of an entrepreneur.
so he uses conflict diamonds To fund his illegal weapons operation.
according to our intel, he is at the moment Arranging the sale of a new nerve toxin
which is extremely lethal and compact.
he designs his weapons himself In a private laboratory underneath his home in geneva.
you two are going to blow it up. - How?
there's an economic summit In geneva tomorrow night at the eagleson center.
Kalume will be attending with his father's delegation,
and afterwards he'll be throwing One of his legendary parties at his home on the lake.
let me guess. We're invited.
actually, you were chosen.
kal has a...Weakness for fashion models.
last week he met with a division agent Who was posing as a broker.
looked through some photos and...He chose the both of you.
sale goes down in 23 hours.
let's go do what division does bestStrike first, strike fast, leave no trace.
Alex. This is a big deal.
we're counting on you.
how could you do this?
you knew we were planning her escape,
and now you're sending her on an overseas mission?
I'm not sending her anywhere.
by the time percy looped me in, She and jaden had already been picked.
you could have fought it. - On what grounds?
you want percy to start asking questions?
it'd put her in more danger.
we do it tonight then. - what?
fake your death. Car accident, like we said.
your id packet's all ready to go.
we'll stage it on the way to the airport. - Out of the question.
we have a very tight window on this mission,
and losing alex would jeopardize that.
this mission?
a division mission.
it's a good mission. - Good for who?
Percy? - For our country.
this nerve toxin can be used in a terrorist attack.
Or...To line percy's pockets?
he won't get his hands on it.
I've designed the explosion To completely incinerate the toxin.
what if it killed me too?
we're supposed to blow up the lab, right?
what if we faked my death on the mission?
that's too risky.
Nikita, that is too risky.
so that's how you want to do this.
in the middle of an operation with division monitoring?
kinda makes it sweeter.
not the point.
listen, if she blows up on foreign soil,
it's not like percy can send a bunch of cleaners To sift through the rubble.
she'd die a hero too.
all we're talking about Is altering the exfil.
could work.
as long as the original mission gets finished.
so we can do it.
Yeah.
Yes.
as long as we don't step on division's toes.
right?
Jaden, now, based on recent performance, You remain on provisional status.
Alex is the lead agent.
are we clear? - Clear.
and, alex, I trust you'll remember the lessons we've shared here.
I will always treasure them.
I thought so.
Alex, you need to understand something - Look, don't even.
I'm not gonna fight you on this. - Good. 'cause I'm not fighting you.
there's two things waiting for me On the other side of this mission a promotion Or a coffin.
and I'm claustrophobic.
trust me.
no one wants this mission to succeed more than I do.
then there won't be any surprises.
not from you and not from me.
we'll watch out for each other.
no surprises.
this is your comm unit.
use that device. It'll override division's channel,
and birkhoff will never hear a thing.
you, me, and alex will have a separate frequency During this operation.
got it.
you were right about the weapons lab.
ventilation room up top, just behind the house.
you can leave the exfil kit there, like you said.
I told alex about it.
perfect.
all right. What was that all about today?
you put the mission before alex. - Absolutely not.
I explained to you that percy - You put the mission before alex,
because you've always believed deep down That there's something good about division.
there is.
Really? All these years, - percy's manipulated you - Percy will pay for what he did.
trust me.
but division has done more good than most people will ever know.
like what?
taking kids off the street and turning them into killers?
or brokering girls like sex workers?
Alex and jaden were picked out of a catalogue By a sociopath.
and they're about to get inside where nobody Not the cia no one could ever get.
this is what I'm talking about.
you don't want to stop this nerve agent?
I do. Of course I do!
I just don't think there's anything good about division.
that can change.
I love you.
I just hate where you work.
and you want me to hate it too? - Yes!
Yes.
Nikita, when I was in the navy...
I felt like I was a part of something...
much bigger than myself.
and that didn't change when I joined division.
I need to know...
that I can make a difference.
it's a part of who I am.
it's a part of who you are too.
I better get going.
I'll call you when I'm on the ground.
Eglisson Center Geneva, Switzerland
we cannot have peace unless we make it for ourselves.
isn't that why we've gathered here today?
we must imagine a region free from unrest And famine and woe.
we must look to the future, and yet...
if this summit is to truly be about peace,
then there are many things we must let go
fear, anger, recriminations from our past.
I have often talked about this with my son.
what I see for the future of our countries And our region
is a peace as strong and bright as the jewels We provide the world.
he's right about one thing.
the rocks are very bright.
one of his flunkies just gave us some swag.
he is good. I'll give him that.
my father keeps telling me I need to let go of childish things.
I tell him, "I will do that,
as soon as you stop lecturing me.
ladies. I see you have been tagged.
tagged? - Yes
isn't that what they do to the wildlife In your country?
they're beautiful.
so have you seen the other girls?
Kalume... Didn't they tell you?
we're not like the other girls.
kalume. Time to go.
this is edgar, part of my father's security team.
the bus is waiting.
ladies, edgar will escort you.
nice work. He's already into you.
nothing I hate more than an entitled rich kid.
ungar Compound-Lake Geneva
they're in.
good. Eyes inside?
no cameras installed.
I guess he likes to keep his orgies on the d l.
we'll be fine with audio.
if the girls don't get what they need from kalume,
I can't hack the door on that lab.
they'll get it.
you don't like the man you work for.
I work for president ungara. Kalume is a boy.
Oh, he likes to have a good time. What's wrong with that?
as long as he never meets my daughter.
Amen.
I wanna see...
how hot these look on you.
let's see.
I'm sorry, baby.
let me see those beautiful eyes again.
I think you've had enough, girl.
you know what?
I can't hold onto these And another drink.
so why don't you be a doll...
and hang onto them for me? All right?
Hey, I paid her to party, not complain.
trust me...
you'll get more bang for the buck with me.
I've got the sunglasses. I'm moving down to the lab.
good. Alex, remember to place the charges On the chemical containers.
it'll act as an accelerant and incinerate the toxin.
it'll destroy the lab without affecting the house.
Nikita, it's me. I'm on the private comm.
we're on schedule.
the exfil kit is in the ventilation room.
one more thing. Once you're free, You're gonna have to be alone for a while.
I know you'll be smart and I know you'll be careful, But...
please be strong.
for yourself. God knows you've been for me.
she must be down in the lab by now.
this party's a blast.
I hear it gets even better afterwards.
you'll just have to wait and see.
you're early. - I'm on schedule. Where is it?
it's in the lab. I'll take you there.
kal, where you going? - You stay here.
you won't even know I'm there.
stay here.
this is jaden.
he's moving to the lab. I think he's got a customer.
copy that. I'm almost there.
OK
the nerve toxin.
it's not what you expected, huh?
you see, I've developed a way to store it in resin form.
then I use a small electrical charge To ignite and disperse it.
what about the delivery system.
you don't expect me to walk into the summit with that brick.
have faith, anya.
the delivery system is the best part.
in resin form, the toxin can be shaped And polished.
the jewelry is a self contained detonator.
let go of me! Let go of me!
and the trigger?
there's an app for that. - What do you think you are doing, kalume?
you have lost your mind. - Tell that to my father.
your father?
if he knew what you are doing down here...
he's trying to bring peace to our country.
with what? Reform?
transition?
he has shown a weakness, edgar.
it's time for me to take the power I deserve!
you are just afraid He will cut off his supply of diamonds to you...
and then you won't be able to buy your whores.
that is the only way you can get a woman to sleep with you.
put him in the box.
if you attack him at the summit, They will know it was you!
no, edgar! Attack them all...
and no one will know who the target is!
you bastard!
let me out! Let me out!
each set of earrings has its own unique code.
Anya, just hit...
send.
let me out of here! Let me out!
let me out of here! Let me out! Out!
No!
these will get you into the summit.
and these...
I think you could make work.
we need to talk.
meet me in the ventilation room.
wait a minute, alex. Slow down.
she wasn't a customer?
no. She's using the toxin, but she's gonna kill his father
and make it look like an attack on the whole summit.
she's gonna gas all of them.
Nikita, are you listening to me?
we have to tell michael. - No.
Anya is on her way.
if we tell michael, he'll follow division protocol
and he'll put you and jaden on the immediate threat.
he'll call off the operation.
Alex...We are this close to getting you out of division.
you have to blow the lab, And they have to believe you're in it.
but the attack. - I'll stop the attack.
you stay on mission. ok?
stay strong.
good luck.
you too.
you did what?
I told alexTo stay on mission. - Nikita...
if the attack is imminent, I need all available resources On it now.
Yeah. I'm available. I've got anya's description,
and I already put the summit into the nav.
I'm ten minutes out.
you know, if percy finds out about the attack,
he'll pull alex off anyway.
he won't find out, Because he won't have time to find out.
Alex will call in, pretend she's trapped,
blow the lab from the outside. She'll die a hero.
look, you can't blow the lab. It'll tip off kalume.
he might accelerate the attack.
or he might get spooked and call the whole thing off.
Michael, let me ask you something.
if I was still at division and this was happening,
who would you put on?
come on. I'm an agent all over again.
isn't that...Some kind of fantasy of yours?
all right. I want a report when you're on the scene.
then we'll blow it. - Michael
Bye.
Alex, do you copy?
Yes. I have one charge left to set.
okay. Finish setting the charges, But don't blow the lab not yet.
you talked to nikita? - Yeah.
look, I know how much you want this.
I do. But we have to wait.
and I believe that the future of peace in our region Begins here.
sweet.
what do you got?
just a nice little pair of c 4 bricks Rigged to blow outside the summit.
what about the nerve agent? - Nothing yet.
and anya? - No contact. Michael...
this is the same van I saw outside of kalume's place.
this has to be part of the plan.
I've already disabled it, so...
why don't we let alex do what she needs to do?
not until you've located anya.
Michael, I'm here. You know I can stop this.
you're asking me to risk innocent lives.
no. I'm asking you to trust me.
Hey, baby.
come on. I wanna dance.
we found these in the lab.
what are these?
those are...Sequins.
don't get cute with me.
this is from your friend's dress where is she?
who said she was my friend?
this is michael back in operations. Report.
are the charges set?
all the charges are set.
but you're still in the lab. Get out of there.
so I should proceed according to plan.
proceed as planned
what is this, spy 101? Just do it.
wait. We have a problem. I'm stuck in the lab.
I see other guards. I think I'm trapped.
let me go!
operations, do you hear that?
I don't know what she's talking about, dude.
I can't hear anything.
no, we do not. What's going on?
stand by. I think it's jaden.
get over there. - Her comm has been damaged.
who are you? Who do you work for?
no one.
Jaden, do you read me? Are you in the lab?
where is your friend?
I know you're working together.
Yes. Yes is the answer.
can you get out of there?
Keep...Talking.
only thing I'm gonna do...
is blow you away.
Blow...You...Away.
now!
Alex...What is going on?
Jaden's been captured.
what?
Alex, report.
I'm gonna save her.
who else knows about the attack on the summit?
who knows?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Cooperate...Or things are gonna get very nasty.
this car bomb makes no sense.
this is supposed to be a nerve gas attack.
frankfort. Three years ago.
remember we stopped that attack by the volksfrei movement?
the corporate retreat.
wait. Didn't the volksfrei do an armed assault?
Yes, they did. But like this summit,
it was a large group in an even larger space.
so what'd they do?
they blew a car and made it seem As if the terrorists were attacking from outside.
they timed it to go off five minutes ago
so that security can herd them all in one place.
a smaller area...
where they could easily gun them down.
or gas 'em.
I'm going inside. Is alex back on?
I'll let you know when it's done.
all right. I'll call you after I take this bitch down.
stop where you are
hang on!
you promised me more bang for the buck.
trust me... I will take that offer.
you have no idea what I'm capable of.
I know exactly what you're capable of.
you think I don't know you? I know you.
and I know what that gun is making up for.
I know you better than you think.
I loved someone just like you...
when I was just a girl. Crushing on you.
then came the night When you tried to use your gun
to take everything away from me.
but you blew it.
and you know what I did to you, superstar?
stuck a knife in the back of your neck While you were sleeping.
people I work for...
they thought I showed initiative.
forget this.
we'll do this the old fashioned way.
down on the ground now. - stop
old fashioned way.
Alex, be advised.
there are three bad guys moving in off the perimeter Coming to you.
you're in charge. How are we doing this?
I guess the hard way.
ladies and gentlemen, please calm down.
there's been a explosion outside, But that's all we know so far.
for security reasons, They have asked that we make our way
to a small room located through those double doors.
we'll be safer there.
Michael, flash traffic is saying There's been an attack
on the developing nations summit in geneva.
we haven't received any reports. We've been a little busy.
they're evacuating the conference,
so pull them from the compound and send them to the summit.
as soon as they finish surviving, sir.
I'm out!
OK
hold on.
not bad for a couple cover girls.
Where'd you get that?
uh, one of kalume's gift bags.
and you gave it up for little old me.
Alex, report.
the lab is destroyed.
jaden with you? - Affirmative.
we're on our way to the extraction point.
copy that. They're safe.
good.
send them to the summit And intercept the threat.
right away.
I left my phone downstairs.
round two.
do I have to beat you again?
cocky. I like that.
you have no idea.
can you hear me now?
those aren't from my country.
appearances can be deceiving, mr. President.
a diamond is dust.
a loyal son a terrorist.
I'm sorry.
Anya weimer. I would love to get my hands on her.
been hunting her for years, and then the swiss capture her.
Really? The swiss.
sounds like she slipped up.
well, maybe she wasn't that great.
you two, on the other hand, were outstanding.
your country thanks you, and I thank you.
good work, alex.
you have a great future here.
all I had to do was press a button...
kalume, the lab, jaden
they would have all been gone.
I'd have been free and clear.
so what stopped you?
you did.
I asked myself, "what would nikita do?
you know what she would do if she were you? Get out.
we can still make that happen, alex.
I'm staying put.
the day I was recruited inside division,
you told me I had a chance to make a difference.
this mission...
Felt...Right.
felt good.
do you really think that percy's Gonna let you hold on to that feeling?
I don't know if I want to stay inside division.
but I am going to stay in this fight.
our fight.
you know where to find me.
she has a right to decide for herself.
that's what scares me.
so it got a little rough.
Yeah. But it was worth it.
are you're telling me You think there's a good side to division?
no.
not unless you're running it one day.
or you are.
Oh, I like windows.
you needed this, michael.
it was a good victory.
it was.
and you got to boss me around again.
not that you listened.
just like old times.
not old times. New times.
you know what this is.
Alex's report on the mission.
what's it say?
it's...Actually very complimentary . that's sweet.
I left this out of my report...Like you asked.
I always did love your initiative.
congratulations, jaden. You're an agent now.
van,
don't shoot!
stay
don't shoot.
news footage triggered a match in our system.
she's a division agent, listed as "presumed dead.
Kelly. She was tossed in a turkish prison four years ago.
she broke out today.
the video was taken about an hour after her escape.
put everyone on this, track her movements, look for people she might contact, places she might go
anything that could help us find her.
and i want to send a team.
a retrieval? - A clean.
is she a threat? She's been in prison for years, why would she talk now?
Kelly wasn't a threat as long as i knew where she was.
call alex in. I want her on this too.
does alex know kelly? - No. But nikita does.
look at her.
she looks so pale, like a ghost.
I'd say she looks pretty good for someone who's supposed to be dead.
well, i checked the box.
there's nothing on here about kelly being alive.
she's logged as k-i-a on operation broken eagle.
operation broken eagle?
your big houdini escape moment.
Michael, you told me that kelly died on a mission after that.
I-I knew that if i told you, you would feel responsible, and i didn't see the point-- she was dead. Or so i was told.
turkish
I've got two border officers ahead.
they're not supposed to be there.
I guess something changed since your last scouting trip.
I think i found a shortcut.
so i am responsible.
I got out on operation broken eagle and kelly gets captured.
that's not a coincidence.
no, you don't know that.
what do you know?
Percy said kelly reported your death and tried to complete the mission without you.
she was shot crossing the border into turkey.
wait, that's your shortcut?
there's no cover on that bridge. - We leapfrog-- i go first, you cover me.
once i'm across the bridge, you can come.
this is why no one wants to be partnered with you on missions.
you take crazy risks.
telling percy that we failed is an even bigger risk, all right?
we're already behind schedule, and he's waiting for this.
if someone's watching-- - if anything happens you turn around and run like hell.
call division. They'll send help.
tac one, nikita is taking fire. - Abort mission. Pull back to waypoint three.
Hey, it's all right.
you're right. Kelly'll head for the border. We need to help her.
the woman in that video didn't look like she needed anyone's help.
when i escaped, michael, i believed that she would make it out, and i was wrong.
she won't be happy to see you.
she's been in prison for four years because i left her behind.
who'd be happy about that?
it's very busy out there.
getting ready to overthrow some poor, unsuspecting government?
we'll get to that. First, i'd like to discuss what happened with the kochenko assassination.
not much to discuss. You asked me to kill him, and i did.
I ordered you to abort the mission, and you disobeyed that order.
Sergei semak stole everything that mattered to me, and kochenko helped him do it.
if you didn't want me to take the hit, you shouldn't have put the gun in my hand.
I understand why you disobeyed me.
because of that, i'm giving you a second chance, an opportunity to redeem yourself.
I didn't know i needed to be redeemed.
I want you to go to turkey and track this woman.
who is she?
former associate of nikita's.
someone she became rather close to during her time at division.
I believe nikita may try to help her.
and you expect me to drop everything to go after them.
what do i get in return?
Sergei semak is not a fan of russian winters.
every year, he picks a sunny spot to spend a month or two.
his location is a closely guarded secret.
we have eyes and ears inside his broker's office.
you would have all the intel you need to plan a hit.
Semak what
a top-level zetrov executive was killed on your watch, gregor.
I suspect this visit from the ceo might be related to that.
I want a progress report on kochenko's shooting.
don't disappoint me and tell me that there is no progress.
we don't know how the shooter got past security.
a lone wolf terrorist is the most difficult to stop or catch. - You agree?
I believe a great deal of effort went into crafting the illusion that this was the work of one man.
perhaps our chief of intelligence has been living with the spies too long.
he sees plots and conspiracies around every corner.
that is why ari will take over the investigation.
sir, i'm in the middle of an operation. I have agents
your agents work for me.
Gogol was created to protect zetrov and its interests.
and you failed to protect kochenko.
now, finding out who shot him and why is your priority.
my men are more than capable of handling the investigation.
I don't need the help of your...
shadow to tell me how to do my job.
Ari, you've been promoted.
this is... Quite unexpected. Thank you, sir.
now tell me your theory on kochenko.
I've heard the americans are unhappy that zetrov is expanding onto their continent.
no, this is personal.
Percy and his bosses feel that they are owed a piece of zetrov because i used a division strike team to take out nikolai udinov.
if the truth got out that you... Instigated his demise.
Percy holds that secret on his little black boxes.
if he reveals it, he exposes the american government involvement as well.
why challenge the stalemate? - And why now?
Oh. That is for you to find out.
I'm late. Clean this up.
first task of my new job?
sometimes a man in my position needs to delegate.
we've been tracking kelly's movements.
there's the jailbreak and the incident with the guards.
this is where she abandoned their vehicle.
she's going west.
if her goal was to get out of the country, she was closer to the eastern borders.
I've never been to turkey, but i'm pretty sure border patrol would notice a woman in a prison uniform trying to cross the border without a passport.
how would someone with no money or contacts get new documents?
she doesn't need new documents.
not if she already had a backup.
where was she staying on that last mission?
a safe house in ankara.
we abandoned the property after that mission four years ago.
if she had a safety net, it's stashed there.
she has to go back to get it.
do we have a location? - We?
it's your job to track nikita.
my job starts when you find her.
don't start. Alex is in turkey. That's why i'm here instead.
Oh, right, kelly. Yeah, i caught her on the news.
it's amazing how division keeps becoming more visible.
tell me what you know. I need this operation to go smoothly.
I know. Bit rocky lately.
bet oversight's been breathing down your neck.
I can handle oversight. - The way you handled kochenko?
that's why you're here, isn't it?
kochenko's death created a situation, didn't it?
and now you don't know who to go to.
you're all alone.
I'm doing fine.
come on... Talk to me.
Alex is becoming impatient.
she wants to go after semak sooner than you planned.
go ahead, take it. But, uh, do come back later, so we can discuss the semak matter over tea like civilized people.
ankara,
Kelly? It's me.
it's nikita. I'm here to help.
division should be on their way. You need to get out of there.
do you remember that park near the parliament building?
meet me there in three hours. I can get you out of the country.
and i can explain... Everything.
how can you be sure she'll show?
if it were me, i'd want that explanation.
I think i see her.
behind the hedges across the path.
Hey, partner.
cleared out the safe house. I want my stuff back.
you don't have to do this. - I want to do this.
take off the bag and hand it over. - All right.
slowly.
I'm not division. - I told you i'm here to help.
Yeah, and last time i followed you across the border, i ended up in prison.
what's your plan this time? To get me killed?
somebody must have made a phone call.
you've got half a dozen local police headed your way in a hurry.
we have to get you out of here. We need to split up.
that's not a good idea. We talked about this.
we didn't expect a police chase either. We need a distraction.
you're coming with me. We can finish this fight after we escape.
excuse me.
a silver sports car? Was it stolen?
no report's been filed yet.
then how are they sure that it's kelly?
she fired at them before fleeing.
none of that sounds right.
y-you pick a fancy car because who would suspect a fugitive in that?
and then you shoot at the police, to what? Make sure that they follow you?
do the police cars have gps tracking?
I'm already in the system.
the police just left the park. Do you want me to monitor their route?
no, listen. The police are chasing a decoy.
Nikita and michael already have kelly. They're leading the police away.
one of those cars should be heading off course.
I've got one headed north.
okay, that's nikita. Watch that car, and tell me where it stops.
eskisehir
there should be fewer police here than at the ankara station.
we'll be safe here until we... Have to board the train.
good.
I saw you die!
I needed you to.
division had to believe i was dead.
you should have warned me.
you would have reported me to division.
it's protocol, nikita.
you were always like that.
Yeah, well, i wasn't as special as you.
I couldn't bat my eyelashes at michael and get out of trouble.
speaking of michael...
who'd you have to screw over to get him out?
I didn't screw you over. Not on purpose. Division did.
you were captured-- division washed their hands of you.
I found out you're alive, i dropped everything to come here.
four years in prison... They did nothing.
I hid this here.
you'll need a disguise to get past the police.
I'm out of options...
so i'll go along with your plan.
but don't expect a thank-you.
I'm not here for your thanks.
you deserve a second chance.
I want to give it to you...
if you'll let me.
Nikita said kelly agreed to the plan. But i don't trust her. Why does she?
you know, i never understood that relationship. It's like oil and... A martian.
when kelly arrived at division...
she was very quiet. Stuck to herself.
Nikita hadn't had an easy transition either.
so they sort of... Gravitated towards each other.
I remember kelly as pretty intense.
not the kind of person you want to cross.
that's my worry.
Nikita's alone with kelly. And i can't protect her.
keep an eye on 'em, huh?
I've got nine on them right now.
may look let
I don't speak french, but do you ladies speak english?
see, we were not, uh, sure what the officer was asking.
he would like to see your identification, and he would like to know the purpose of your visit.
Oh! We're on holiday and next is istanbul, and then, unfortunately, back home.
went so fast, no? - So fast.
Oh, merci, merci.
may i?
we have a few hours... If you want to get some rest.
I don't think i can.
what happens when we get to istanbul?
well, we meet up with michael, get you across the border.
then you're free. You can go wherever you want.
I don't know where to go.
I hadn't thought that far ahead.
how'd you find a way out?
they were taking me back to the cell when a guard got hurt.
the others left me to go help him.
they forgot they hadn't locked my door yet. So i ran.
you won't have to run much longer.
what about you?
why aren't you hiding out somewhere on a beach with michael?
I do want that.
except the hiding part, of course.
Kelly, when we make it to that beach, i want to be free of division and everything we've done.
that's what we're working on. Trying to make things right.
what we've done, nikita...
that's not something you can fix.
Nikita has to be here. The police car she stole is parked out front.
once the train's moving, there'll be no means of escape.
all
is there anything else you remember about that day?
maybe...
maybe something you forgot in all the chaos?
I don't know.
kochenko was on stage
something before the shooting.
something that...
would have seemed unimportant at the time.
there was a girl.
a photographer.
she wanted a better view than the press area provided.
and she was a pretty girl, i'd guess.
it's probably why you let her go.
Oh, no.
no press passes were issued to any female photographers.
that's all right. Maybe you can work with a sketch artist.
tell me... What do you remember about her?
sh-she was a young russian woman.
maybe 20. about 5'6," blue eyes, long, brown hair.
uh, excuse me. English? - Yes.
um, i'm looking for my friends on the train, but i can't find them.
you know, we were going to meet in istanbul tonight, um, but i got on the earlier train.
so anyway, um, have you seen them?
I'm sorry, i don't recognize them.
you know-- you know, these are old pictures.
look again. They might look a little different now.
there were two women. They're up ahead. Fourth car, i believe.
thank you so much.
Yeah. - You have to get off the train now!
kind of hard, birkhoff. It's moving.
I've got roan and alex entering the train station just before you pulled out, and i think they're onboard.
No! It's locked! We have to stop this train.
or we fight. I think we can pick off the girl pretty easy.
we can't kill her. - Why not? She's a division agent.
you don't know her, kelly. I do.
okay. Fine, fine. Maybe we can disable her.
we have tactical advantage back there. Only one way in.
there's only one way out. These people would be defenseless.
unless we get them out of here before the fighting starts.
Oh, my god! Found them.
come on.
you can't be serious.
when can we get off this thing?
Sonya, can you stop the train?
I tripped a switch about 15 minutes ahead.
they'll have to stop to manually reset it.
while we're stuck here, check...
the area for gas stations, restaurants, anything.
Nikita's going to need new wheels.
Hey. We're off the train. Don't ask. We need a new plan.
uh, can you make it to the docks in istanbul?
Birkhoff will find us a freighter or something.
let me see what i can do. I'll call you when i'm on my way.
I'm gonna use the ladies' room while you car-shop.
maybe i can fix this poor thing.
Hey, it's kelly. Can you trace us?
I didn't expect to hear from you so soon. Something wrong?
division just showed up.
does nikita have the black box? - Not on her.
and she hasn't said anything about it. Are you sure she has it?
one of our associates swore that she didn't, and then he threatened to kill me.
he was a terrible liar. She has it... Somewhere.
they seem to have a home base. Maybe the black box is there.
when i find it-- - deliver the box, you'll get everything we agreed upon.
these division agents-- do i need to send someone to clean that up?
no. They're alive.
Nikita refused to kill one of them. Some girl.
Nikita protecting a division agent?
how unlike her. Who was the lucky lady?
her name's alex. She must be new.
describe her to me.
early 20s, white, maybe 5'6," brown hair, blue eyes.
I've sent you an image. Is that her?
Yeah. Who is she?
she's an assassin, who i would very much like to speak with.
forget the box. Find the girl, bring her to me.
forget the box? - Don't worry, our deal stays the same.
in fact, i think your job just got a lot easier.
your new target is already chasing you.
what? No luck with the wig?
uh, it was kinder to put it out of its misery.
this it?
we'll be in istanbul before he even knows it's gone.
so where do we start?
there's a restaurant right up ahead.
it's the closest spot from where they jumped.
I keep wondering why you wanted to protect that division agent.
Alex isn't like us. The way she got into division...
it's different, it's-- it's complicated.
then explain it.
we were partners.
before michael and birkhoff, it was alex and i against division.
that's how you took down percy.
you had a man inside.
what happened?
I was trying to protect her.
there were things that i...
didn't think she could handle, so i kept them from her.
when she found out, she realized she couldn't trust me.
guess no one warned alex about saint nikita.
what's that supposed to mean? - It's how you operate.
you're the only one who can handle the truth.
you're the only one who knows the right thing to do.
you know, amanda had a theory about that.
I don't care. - Liar.
she said you need people but you don't trust them.
you withhold information to keep them dependent on you but make their choices for them so they can't disappoint you.
so i get why alex doesn't trust you.
but why stay at the place she tried to destroy?
you know amanda. She's got her confused.
she's made her believe that she needs division.
I should've never let that place get its hooks into her.
Alex defied you. She killed kochenko...
and wants to go after semak now.
I think she's finally coming into her own.
the baby bird prepares to leave the nest.
will you be willing to let this one fly away?
or are you gonna make her chew her own foot off, like nikita did, in order to escape you?
or is that a coyote metaphor?
Alex doesn't have to escape me.
I only want what's best for her.
I made the mistake of underestimating your ambition once. I won't do it again.
you wanna replace semak with your own little puppet. I know.
I'm helping alex regain what's rightfully hers.
though i believe that when she's back at zetrov, she'll remember who her real friends are.
for what it's worth, when nikolai died, several members of his inner circle vanished.
if you were to be able to find them, perhaps they could help you reestablish alex's rightful place on the throne...
so to speak.
I appreciate the information.
but i have to ask, why are you willing to help?
what do you want?
you know what i want.
actually, i wouldn't mind having my clothes back.
not into the onesie.
found this in the ladies' room. It's not like nikita to be this sloppy.
they must've found a car. Although no one here has reported one stolen.
I'm looking for my phone.
this is the last place i used it, but it's not in my purse.
maybe we have another way to track them.
we'll pull in here and meet michael on the other side of the road.
it's the tire.
let me see if there's a spare.
I'm never getting out of this country.
michael will come get us.
we're gonna need to take cover before he gets here. I'm gonna take a look.
find a spot with a view of the road. We don't need any more surprises.
are you at the docks?
no, i'm on the side of the road with a flat and no spare.
I knew we shouldn't have split up.
do you know of a safe place where you can wait for me?
Kelly's out looking, but there's nowhere to hide the car.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
wait. Nikita.
Kelly, we have your location. I've sent a team to capture the girl.
so i found a spot. It's not too far uphill.
I think there's a great, big tree
so how long you been working for gogol?
Birkhoff, nikita hung up on me, and i can't get her back on the line.
do you have her location?
she's just off the main road. I'm sending you coordinates now.
you work for ari?
I'm not working for anyone.
I sat in a cell, waiting to die.
Ari offered me a way out.
so ari broke you out to kill me. What are you waiting for?
killing you wasn't my mission.
as much as ari wants you dead, he wants percy's black box more.
all i had to do was get it.
you lost your shot at it.
pretty stupid, keeping the phone on you, too.
when i told ari about alex, my orders changed.
I went from trojan horse to bait.
and that phone is how gogol knows we're here.
division's still a few minutes out, but she's not alone.
based on the satellite system these transmitters are using, these guys are not division.
get in.
Michael, kelly works for gogol.
the flat tire... It's a trap for alex.
look, birkhoff's picked up russian transmitters at your location.
Gogol is already there, nikita.
according to the cell phone signal, they should be here.
run.
we are under attack! Please send backup to the
come out, nikita!
or i shoot your old partner in the head.
your choice.
you won't shoot her. Ari's orders are to take her back to gogol.
maybe we should just shoot you.
you okay? - Yeah.
okay, i'll do a sweep.
Gogol set a trap for me?
Kelly saw you. She told ari.
he sent her to grab you. I'm not sure why.
if they know who i am-- - we can help you. Come with us. Please.
if i say no, are you going to shoot me again?
I'm sorry.
I've made a lot of mistakes, starting with not telling you the truth.
we were partners. I should've treated you like one.
I have to go back to division.
if i'm a gogol target, it will be the safest place for me. They can protect me.
we can protect you.
I have to kill semak. And not just for revenge now.
if he realizes that i am alive, he will want to fix that mistake.
division has the resources that i need, and they won't let anything happen to me. You know that.
I know you, alex.
you're a good person.
I know you'll make the right choice.
Gogol targets down. Backup is five minutes out. Where are you?
you guys, backup's coming. You gotta run. - Okay.
uh, we can't go back up to the road. But i know another way.
Kelly's here. She's dead.
no sign of nikita.
there's no way you could've known.
as cons go, it was a pretty good one.
Kelly really sold it, right down to the dead prison guards.
I really wanted to help her.
even after i found out the truth.
I would've freed her from everyone, including ari.
that's who you are.
when you find someone in trouble, you wanna help.
and alex almost got captured.
Yeah, well, she wasn't.
because of you.
we wouldn't have gotten out of there if it wasn't for you.
Thanks. That's my job. We're partners.
can we, uh, think of another word?
I don't have a very good track record with partners.
well, your track record doesn't matter anymore because we're together now.
so you can call it whatever you want.
boy toy?
except that.
look, something good came from this.
you wanted to help someone you cared about, and you did.
Alex is safe.
back at division.
well, she let us escape. That's a good sign.
I think she'll come around.
I'm glad you're back, safe and sound.
you did some excellent work. I believe even roan was impressed.
I didn't get nikita or the black box.
you took care of the situation with kelly, and that could've been very damaging to us.
well, it doesn't feel like a win.
Gogol targeted me, and i don't know why.
I suspect it has something to do with kochenko.
though they never have targeted a division agent like that before.
they already know what i look like.
how long do you think before they figure out who i really am?
I will lose the element of surprise, and that was my one advantage.
no. You have me and all of division behind you.
we'll get semak.
he'll come after me. - He will.
and division will be here to protect you.
we'll keep you safe.
you've made progress on the kochenko investigation?
I've identified the shooter.
division, as we suspected.
I believe i know why they've made this move against you.
I knew you were the right man for the job.
tell me about the shooter.
young woman. Russian.
it's funny... There was something familiar about her, but i didn't place it until i learned her name.
it's alex.
she's alive?
division didn't kill her that night. Someone got her out.
why would she come back?
my guess is she wants to kill you and reclaim her birthright.
who else knows about this? - No one. I've snipped all the loose ends.
Oh, and i took the liberty of canceling your winter vacation.
you'll be safer here.
if word gets out, she'll have supporters within the company.
people will expect me to restore her to her rightful place.
I can put together a small team of men dedicated to finding her.
whatever you need, it's yours.
but your orders are not to find her, ari.
they are to shoot on sight.
I want alexandra udinov dead.
welcome to the former new york branch of zigzag, Yet another dot-com startup gone bye-bye.
place was actually a steal considering the square footage Up in this piece.
office space, birkhoff? Really?
Yeah. Nikita incorporated, baby.
live and work all in the same space, Just like the enterprise.
thought you were looking for a beach house.
Yeah, uh, i'm still, um, still working on that.
it's secure, at least. Should be okay until i get back.
get back? Where you going?
London. - London? What are you doing in london?
I'm going to visit my son. Is that okay with you?
your what?
I didn't know you had a-- Wait a minute, are you talking about cassandra's boy?
as in only child of the ex-belarusian first lady?
his name is max.
Birkhoff. Seriously, stay out of it.
you're not thinking about bringing the kid back, are you?
cause i'm not really set up for a... - All right, i asked you nicely.
no, no, no. Listen.
we're all in this together. We shouldn't keep secrets.
Max is mine.
cassandra told nikita right before we left belarus.
and no, i'm not bringing him back here.
and i just want to see him.
I don't really have a plan after that.
so are you coming back?
Yes. My guess is it'll be a short trip.
no wonder you guys are in such a bad mood.
rise and shine, killer. It's almost 8: 00.
briefing's about to start. - Briefing?
we should get somebody to swing by your apartment, Pick up some new clothes.
in the meantime...
where are we going?
to see the boss.
morning, recruit.
why did you let him out of his cell?
I didn't. You did.
no, technically, i blackmailed her.
wait. Where are you going?
home.
which home? Your apartment?
Oh, i wouldn't recommend it.
did you forget that there's a gogol hit squad Currently scouring the city for alexandra udinov?
or were you referring to the family home, la maison de famille,
which lies amidst the ashes of your parents-- A crime you still fail to avenge?
I'm trying to. - Really? How?
by hiding under the covers while amanda protects you From the big bad?
Sergei semak is out there, Living like a king, running your father's empire, Laughing at you.
you let me out of here now.
but i thought you said you wanted to go home.
need to talk.
Nikita. She told you.
all i'm asking for is five minutes.
for what?
I just-- I just want to look at him.
you owe me that much.
five minutes.
and you don't tell him why you're here.
as far as max knows-- - His father was buried two weeks ago, i know.
senator madeline pierce has been head Of the subcommittee for state and foreign operations For the past 12 years.
no wonder division's been able to move so freely On international soil.
we need to profile one of her staff, Preferably someone low on the totem pole.
what? - W--nothing.
just--you know, you told me to scan The london street cabs and erase images of michael.
you wanna come check my progress? - You know what you're doing.
so you're not curious. - No.
so if i were to tell you that he and cassandra Are out on a walk right now,
you wouldn't want to see that.
you were supposed to be scrubbing. Not spying.
it must have been a shock to find out about max.
I guess i should explain myself.
I got you stuck in a false marriage You had to pretend was real.
you did what you had to do.
what the hell? - Just take it easy. It's just a walk.
anyway, she can't kick ass like you.
shut up, birkhoff. Zoom in on that guy.
looks like he's shadowing them.
I knew if i stayed in belarus, i'd never be able To get out from under ovechkin's reputation.
his oppressive politics. All of it.
that's why i came here. I wanted a fresh start.
do you know anyone in the city?
when i headed up to your place, i saw someone leaving.
Oh. Oh, you mean nigel.
he's a friend. I've known him since oxford.
Hey. Is everything okay?
you've got a tail. 7: 00. peacoat.
how are you-- - london street cams. He's moving in.
here, come here. Get away from here, now!
Oh, my god. - I think those guys were after me.
no.
they were after me.
it's all right.
get me on a charter to heathrow. Whatever gets me there fastest.
you're going to london? - Michael's in trouble.
Yeah, no kidding.
he's asleep finally.
good. Keep away from the windows.
you don't have to do this.
Cassandra, those two guys tried to kill you.
I'll get the security detail. - You have one.
you can't protect me. There are too many of them.
who are they?
ex-soldiers. They work for a man named tupelov.
general tupelov. He was a member of my husband's cabinet.
when he died, tupelov lost all his power.
he believes i had something to do with my husband's death.
I thought ovechkin's bodyguard was responsible.
tupelov never accepted that.
he made some threatening phone calls, But i never thought it would come to this.
why don't you get some rest?
Michael, please. The building is secure.
I've turned on the alarm. - Then we shouldn't be disturbed.
so you'll just stay up?
all night?
you never needed much sleep.
I was always jealous of that.
then take advantage.
I'll see you in the morning.
you wanted to see me?
I don't have to be here. - Actually, you do.
if i told amanda you warned nikita about dear old dad, You might just lose your head.
speaking of nikita, Now that you two are palling around again,
you got any bright ideas On how you might be able to get that black box back?
does put you in a bit of a pickle, doesn't it?
if you don't get amanda the box, She won't get to the resources you need To eliminate semak.
what do you want?
I want you to think About what you really need In order to take out semak.
reinforcements? Weapons?
nothing you couldn't buy on your own.
if i had the money, which i don't. - But what if you did?
see, i just happen to have this offshore account With some funds that need shuffling.
you make a transfer for me...
I'll give you 100, 000 bucks.
that should be enough to get your mission Off the ground, don't you think?
why would you need to make a transfer? You can't buy anything in here.
Amanda's been trying to get her hands on that money Ever since she betrayed me.
and i'm not about to let her get it.
I could take everything. Wipe you out.
you could.
but the account we're talking about is hardly everything.
you'd be closing the door on any further opportunity, And you'd be pissing me off.
we're close to sealing this deal. I can tell.
let me put a bull's-eye on the target for you.
after burning your family's home to the ground...
has rebuilt it to its former glory.
he's living in your old house, alex.
take a look at the satellite pictures. See for yourself.
how much longer you gonna let him get away with that?
here you go.
why is your friend here at 8: 00 in the morning?
Nigel's been taking max to school The last few days.
school? Is that safe? - Michael, please.
half of st. John's students are children Of foreign dignitaries.
the campus has armed security.
I will go with them, all right?
Nigel will walk me straight back here Once we drop off max.
sorry. I didn't know you had company.
this is michael.
he's an old family friend visiting from out of town.
Cassandra's told me a lot about you. She says you two go way back.
funny, she never mentioned you at all.
you here for business or pleasure?
business. I'm an art dealer.
Ah, that must be why she keeps you around.
has she driven you mad searching for that Jules breton of hers?
we better get going.
I look forward to seeing you again. - Likewise.
I'm sorry about this. - It's not your fault.
no, i just keep thinking about what you said About bringing danger with me.
you didn't bring this. These clowns aren't division. Okay?
okay. What'd birkhoff dig up on tupelov?
you know, your basic thug promoted to general, Busted back down to thug.
thanks to cassandra, or so he believes. Is he in london?
not even hiding it. He's up in tottenham at a joint called tovarish cafe.
Oh, and birkhoff says he's got backup. - So do i.
we're here to see general tupelov.
I am intrigued.
what could two americans possibly want At a hole-in-the-wall that serves potato babkas?
we just came here to give you a message.
leave cassandra ovechkin alone.
I don't know who sent you, But mrs. Ovechkin and i have unfinished business.
trust me. You don't want to get involved.
I'm already involved.
I was hoping you'd do that.
no, michael. He got it, he got it.
stay away from her.
mother, you have to take this seriously.
Gaines named you before he died In front of nikita.
Sean, i have my own security.
and i don't think nikita would risk a direct attack On a united states senator.
you have no idea what she's capable of.
and you do. What have you learned about her?
her weak points.
specifically, the people she cares about. - Michael.
Alex.
her former mole.
there's still a bond between them. Trust me.
and unlike michael, I know exactly where alex is.
so you plan to use her as bait.
if there's still a bond there, she won't cooperate.
unless she forms a different bond.
what does that mean?
Oh, sean. Seduction?
mother-- - It's risky. That's all.
unless she's already taken a liking to you.
just let me take care of it. Okay?
the sooner i take down nikita, The sooner you're safe.
and the sooner you can walk away from division.
Amen.
she gave you a key. - Yeah.
with everything going on, She wanted to give me the spare.
18 missed phone calls? Somebody's been trying to reach her.
Hello?
I believe we met this morning. At the restaurant, yes?
you took a long time getting back to the apartment.
your paramour has gotten herself into some trouble.
and according to her, You're the only one who can get her out of it.
where is she?
first tell me where my $200 million is.
$200 million?
you think ovechkin would leave her with that kind of money?
shoulda picked a different heiress to ransom.
it's too late to play games.
she confessed she gave you the money for safekeeping.
you have till 9: 00 p. m. this evening To return it to me.
after that, everybody's luck runs out.
school says max is fine. Please confirm.
just got a visual on st. John's prep.
place is a fortress.
and max just scored a soccer goal. Holler. He's safe.
any leads on cassandra?
Yeah, a green jeep picked up her trail When she was on the way to school with max And some guy.
looked like a real douche boat.
it's nigel. We should track him down.
maybe he saw something. - Nothing i'm not seeing already.
it should be pretty easy to pinpoint The jeep's location.
you better, because at 9: 00 tonight,
tupelov's gonna open up his bank account And realize the 200 million is not there.
we need to find cassandra before he does. - Or we find the money first.
we search this apartment, her accounts, We give the general what he wants.
what makes you so sure she has the money? - She confessed to tupelov.
so he would call me.
we're her best shot at getting her out of this alive.
but you don't trust her at all, do you?
she seems to have a history of... Hiding the truth.
I just don't want to go into a situation blind. That's all.
I got her.
after cassandra dropped off max, She stopped in some boho espresso joint.
she goes into the bathroom, never comes back out.
few minutes later, street vid shows A giant duffel bag going into that same green jeep.
that's how they grabbed her.
Satscan shows the suv in canvey island, Middle of nowhere.
it upsets me that things had to escalate like this.
but when you took the money your husband left me, You forced my hand.
people know who i am.
and they know you're after me. You won't get away with killing me.
unless i have the perfect alibi.
see, while i'm out having dinner, You will join the likes of princess diana And princess grace -
a grisly car wreck After one too many dirty martinis.
at least, that's what the coroner will say.
I'll call when the money's in.
Hey, have you seen the boss?
she had some meeting off-site today.
why, you plan on raiding her closet?
you'll need a computer that isn't linked To the division server.
it's the only way to elude amanda.
are you familiar with the tech impound? - Sure.
when agents bring back enemy phones, Computers to be vetted, that's where they're stored.
but i don't have access.
you know, embrace your ingenuity.
it wouldn't be the first time You've lifted somebody's fingerprints.
not a lot of foot traffic on sub-level 8, But it is patrolled, so you'll have to be quick.
the funds you're transferring Are at luxembourg banque rocher, Account number 4398473.
pin number 0996.
it's going to el banco islas, Account 9129483.
once that transaction's been confirmed,
you can transfer the 100, 000 into an account Of your choosing.
you wanna tell me what the hell You're doing down here?
there's at least four on the perimeter. Let's flank the shed, overlapping arcs.
they took her!
get cassandra!
I'll figure out a way out of here. - How?
save cassandra!
no.
why didn't you listen to me? - Because you'd be dead.
No! No! - Michael!
thanks for thinning out the ranks.
six men was a bit much, even for me.
especially when your resistance to fentanyl Isn't what it used to be.
how did you-- - Fight like you?
I didn't.
americans use krav maga. We at mi6 practice straight jiu-jitsu.
wait, you're british intelligence?
that entire time in belarus -
I had been embedded in my cover for two years When you began your op.
so you were lying when-- - When i met you, lying to me?
Yes. - You knew i was an agent.
I suspected as much.
figured you could be a valuable source of intel.
listen, right now i just want to get max.
Max is fine. We checked on him.
does mi6 know that max is-- - No.
they think he's ovechkin's, And i plan to keep it that way.
look, tupelov doesn't know we took out his men,
but he will in a couple hours When the money doesn't go through.
our window is closing.
then we have to neutralize him before his deadline.
I can't believe you would help percy.
I'm not waiting around in here any more.
there's no way it's as easy as it seems. There has to be some kind of catch.
maybe. But the price was right.
so cash is suddenly the answer to all your problems.
it won't help you get the black box from nikita.
I only need the black box to get amanda's help.
with this money, I can get semak on my own.
it always comes back to revenge with you, doesn't it?
Sean, you don't know what it's like To have your family targeted Because of who they are, and losing them Because of it.
I understand family loyalty. I know i'd go a long way for mine.
someone's coming.
Mr. Pierce.
no need for alarm, boys. Just checking out some evidence.
how'd you get in here?
Amanda gave me clearance.
is there a problem?
no. No problem, sir.
not bad. For a boy scout.
I got a merit badge in lying.
don't you have a transfer to finish?
when mi6 found me, I'd been studying in london for years.
but i still looked and sounded like a nice girl from kletsk.
they thought i'd be the perfect fit To get close to valeri ovechkin.
that's a big ask. Being the president's wife.
nobody was expecting a marriage proposal.
but with the access it gave me, Nigel was thrilled.
Nigel? Your friend?
my handler. I've reported to him since i first went to belarus.
actually, he should be on his way with max right now.
when he gets here, we can explain you're cia, Maybe tell him you yanks had an angle on tupelov.
that's what brought you here.
we're not cia. We're independent. Rogue.
if six found out, They'd turn us in to the cia.
they'd try us as traitors.
why didn't you tell me all this?
I don't think you get to ask me that question anymore.
look, i'm gonna have birkhoff trace tupelov's cell.
if we want to keep him in the dark, He can't know why he's not reaching His men on the cliff.
I'm sorry, michael. - No, no. I...
the first time i met you, I told you hundreds of lies.
I can't judge you for doing the same thing.
one day it just hits you, doesn't it?
no one in your life knows your real name, What your real job is or...
what your real dreams are.
that's why i decided to keep max.
he's the only true thing in my life.
and i only have him because of you.
that's nigel.
Nigel, where's max?
they're looking after him at the school.
why didn't you bring him home?
because i didn't want him to see this.
hands up. Nice and easy.
clear the premises. - Yes, sir.
what is this?
I want to know why an american intelligence officer Is skulking around on british soil,
seeking out my agent five years after they met On his mission.
clear.
upstairs is clear.
please, he was just trying to help. - He has no sovereignty here.
I can explain. - I hope so.
cause he's not leaving this house Until i know exactly what's going on.
no proper identification.
no contact name for your superiors in the states.
you have some explaining to do.
why don't you start by telling me What you were doing with my agent?
she was in trouble. I helped her out.
cassandra has the force of the s. i. s. behind her.
why seek out your protection from tupelov?
she was trapped. He was demanding the money.
so you know about the 200 million.
where do you think it went? - How the hell should i know?
well, cassandra has confided in you quite a bit.
over the years she's confided in me as well.
I've been her handler since belarus, And she tells me everything.
except when it comes to you.
Yeah, with you, she gets a bit cagey.
it's curious.
five years after you meet, you drop in on cassandra Out of the blue.
surely it wasn't just to say hello.
and cassandra's not on a mission right now, So i'm guessing it was over a personal matter.
five years.
Max is five years old. Isn't he?
I'm not sure who you read too much of...
le carre or conan doyle.
either way, you're looking for a mystery Where there isn't one.
I will not let the two of you compromise this agency.
you're gonna tell me everything cassandra told you About her cover, tupelov, The money, all of it.
and it's sir conan doyle.
did you honestly think you could take them out Without alerting nigel?
have to start somewhere.
if the people we worked for know michael's here,
they'll come for him, and they could come for max too.
you have to get him released.
if nigel knew i was out here, it'd be bad enough.
I disobey direct orders, and six will string me up.
there'd be no one to take care of max.
but you're not under their command.
9435 is the code to my alarm system.
I unlatched a window in the basement.
what if they realize you helped me?
I trust you not to get caught.
what about your handler?
I'll take care of him.
Nigel. - You'll get your chance to talk.
I know everything is messed up right now.
but i just got a tip from one of my belarusian contacts.
tupelov is planning to flee the country in an hour.
slow down. We'll send a team.
there's no time.
I'm ending the threat on my family tonight.
with or without your approval.
wait.
I'm coming with you.
we'll get back to this in a few.
I can't get sherman on the radio. Go check.
Thanks. - Yeah, don't thank me.
thank cassandra. She's the one who got nigel outta here.
there's something off about that guy.
one minute he's suspicious of cassandra.
the next he's trying to help her get tupelov.
he keeps asking about the money.
wait, she would've reported back the 200 million, right?
after she learned about it in belarus.
including the account numbers and the access codes.
wait a minute. When ovechkin died
Nigel probably figured this was his chance To swipe the pot.
cassandra has no idea.
hands. Now.
almost 9: 00.
you probably thought your money was coming Any minute now.
you've won.
let me go, And you'll never hear from me again.
why wait?
what are you doing?
just cleaning up.
I'll hold 'em off. Get inside.
you came here to apprehend tupelov, But he shot you.
bastard.
come on, then, love.
give us a kiss.
you okay? - Yeah.
come here.
wire order's in.
just waiting for confirmation.
let's just hope it's quick.
why are you doing this?
doing what? - Helping me.
what's in it for you?
let's just call it payback For that hit you took for me in the park.
you paid me back when you took out the shooter.
what are you doing down here, anyway?
God, you are paranoid. - Tell me.
I don't have to tell you anything.
you're the one down here breaking the rules, remember?
so why don't you turn me in?
because i don't care for the rules here either.
not good enough. What's your angle?
why do i have to have an angle?
because everyone has an angle.
fine. Kiss me.
what?
you want my angle? There it is.
and since apparently the normal rules of attraction Don't apply to you,
and you insist on some sort of trade Or price to be paid for my good deed, There it is.
a kiss.
and the reason i came down here to the impound Was i was looking for you.
I started at your room.
transfer is complete.
give me your hand.
you never said where.
to: guardian france one from: percy secondary protocol activated - if you need anything-- - I will call.
but we're fine. Nobody is after us anymore.
Yeah, well, some of tupelov's men might be out there.
you might want to alert max's school.
Michael, i've got a handle on it.
and if i don't, mi6 does.
that's right. You gonna stay with the agency?
if they'll let me.
I'll cooperate with the investigation of nigel,
and then i'm hoping my assignments Will take me out of the field.
less liabilities.
what?
you don't see it yet.
see what?
something's happening.
and i can't let it go, And i can't push it away, Because i've done that, and it's always ended badly.
if this is about cassandra
it's about max.
can i ask you a question, michael?
you're safe now.
but are you willing to walk away And never look back?
what?
are you willing to walk away And never see your child again Or his mother?
no, because that's not my only choice.
it is. You just can't see it.
I know you. Better than anyone.
I know your heart.
I know the way it works.
you focus all your energy on one point.
that's how you survived division all those years.
focusing on revenge for your family.
you made yourself blind to the truth.
until you showed it to me.
Nikita, i love you. - I love you too.
but i'm not like you, michael.
you lost something i never had.
now you have a chance to get it back.
Nikita, no.
and because of that, You have to take it because if not, You are going to be left with "what if?
that is the most dangerous question i know.
I didn't plan for this.
there's no plan for this.
only a question that you need to resolve.
and you can't do it with me here.
operation Pale Fire.
division collaborated with Sergei Semak to kill Nikolai Udinov and his family.
I saved the daughter, Alexandra.
your partner?
that's why she's working with you to take down the Division.
her focus has shifted. - Revenge.
that's where I'm going...
to get the man who ordered my parents to die.
and I'm going to kill him.
mom?
the guardians... they're gathering, and Percy is behind it.
we don't know if anything is happening with Percy, but what we do know is that Ari has the Box.
I'll go after the guardian. You go after Ari.
and you'll be fine with him.
no. Michael goes with you.
you're chasing Ari Tasarov into the heart of Gogol territory.
you don't even know where he's headed.
Yeah, she does. I put a tracker on his car.
I don't know what I'm going to find there, but it's the right thing to do.
Hello, Ari.
operation Pale Fire...
background is need-to-know.
this is the target zone.
these are the Tangos...
peration PALE FIRE
Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear.
our man on the inside has provided extensive Intel to the layout of the home and all the security measures that are in place.
Papa Bear likes to maintain a semblance of normalcy for his family, so the estate grounds will be far more heavily guarded than inside the house itself.
patrols will be shifted to the North, so you will come up through the woods from the South, up the drive, and into the front door.
current alarm codes will be in your briefing packet.
review the material, be ready in two hours.
dismissed.
Roan, stay back a minute.
is there a problem?
how?
how?
mama...
I thought you were dead.
they said, mother down.
no. Nikolai... he heard men downstairs...
shooting. He left me.
I can't remember.
I saw a gun.
I woke up in hospital.
you were dead.
everyone was dead.
my baby girl, my baby girl!
it's okay, Momma.
I made it out. We both did.
I'm right here.
how?
someone took me.
she saved my life.
bingo.
Michael: Have eyes on box. They're trying to crack it. May see a way to grab!
AMESTERDAM, HOLLAND
what's that? Update for Nikata.
she's found the Black Box.
I know you guys want to replace the Box you lost, but maybe she should just let it goe
we can't let Ari keep that Box.
if he finds a way to decrypt it, I don't want to think about what he'd do with those dirty secrets.
you should be with her.
I could've tracked this guardian on my own.
he's going to meet up with the other guardians.
you want to take on all three by yourself?
no. Nikita was right.
we got to grab that Box and then figure out what the guardians are up to...
what Percy's up to.
What'd you find?
I narrowed it down to these six hotels.
those are some nice places.
I thought the guardians were more "bed of nails" and all.
easier to get lost in a crowd at a big hotel.
these are the right size, near public transportation, with multiple points of egress.
okay, so we zero him down, track him to the gathering, and figure out how Percy's pulling the strings.
why are you still in London? - Excuse me?
Nikita says you're staying in London to be with the kid.
is that gonna be a permanent thing or...?
why is she even talking to you about this?
she needs to talk to somebody.
it's getting harder for her.
maybe she can't talk to you'cause she thinks she already lost you.
she hasn't. - I know.
that's why I'm warning you.
you need to make a choice before someone makes it for you.
and who's gonna make that for me...
you?
I don't have a kid.
you killed her fiance.
Yeah. Nikita said he was a nice, normal guy...
didn't deserve to die...
neither did Emily.
she was innocent, just like your son.
she died because of me, because that's what happens when normal people get sucked into our world.
they get hurt.
mama, have you been here all these years...
in this house?
what happened?
I have to hide.
what?
no one can know I'm here.
Why?
are you all right?
I heard voices downstairs. What's happening?
I'm attending to some business.
why are you so nervous?
whenever I hear too many voices downstairs, it makes me think of the men who...
who cannot hurt you now.
the house is protected. No one knows you're here.
Oh, I don't need that.
let's not go through this again, Katya.
you need some rest.
take the pill.
I should've killed Semak when I had the chance.
Alexandra... - It's okay, mama.
I understand now.
Semak was always jealous of papa.
he always wanted everything papa had, so he took it.
he can have Zetrov, but he can't have you...
not anymore.
I just don't understand.
I have to leave for a few minutes, but I'll be right back.
just stay here.
we are leaving.
crap.
Hello, Ryan.
how are you feeling today? More cooperative?
if this is about oversight...
I need to neutralize them now, in a way that doesn't raise questions or leave evidence to trace back to me.
I've given you their identities. You've had a while to think.
I kept you alive because I thought you might be useful, but if I was wrong...
then I should correct my mistake.
I told you...
the only way I can help is if I know everything on Division, oversight...
even the details you don't think are relevant.
you know...
today is your lucky day.
I'm gonna have to take you to the files.
they don't transport well.
so, now you want to take down oversight.
and your big hope is the little librarian.
that's just sad.
I need some leverage to keep the lights on around here.
bringing down oversight is something we all want...
you, me...
even the librarian here.
remind me... what's in it for me?
fine.
I'll give you your things back, if you give him something useful.
how about I give him the mercy of a quick death?
well, that wouldn't be very polite, would it?
yeah? What are you gonna do about it...
kill me?
three words, Percy... Medically induced coma.
consider the consequences.
play nice.
what a bitch, right?
why are you here?
Ari Tasarov has a Black Box.
I'm here to steal it back.
so your plan is to cut the power, let everyone freak and grab the Box in the chaos?
that was the...
Yeah.
Oh, careful. Can't let you do that...
not without screwing up my plan to rescue my mother.
she's alive, Nikita. She's upstairs.
your mother? How? - I don't know.
but if I'm gonna get her out, no one can know we're here.
where are we with the Box?
well, we think we found a way around the biometrics lock, but the data encryption may take weeks to break.
I've never seen anything like it.
Percy is nothing if not paranoid.
it's one of his few admirable qualities.
keep on it.
Mr. Abramov, did you receive the photograph I sent you?
it's her... The girl who bought my weapons.
she's here in Russia.
tell no one else. I'll take care of it.
Yes, Mr. Tasarov?
increase patrols on the estate immediately, then come up to the house.
I'd like to discuss the perimeter breach we spoke of earlier.
I have to disable the alarm.
let me sneak her out, then I'll go.
look, you can blow up this damn house, for all I care, after I know she's safe.
baby, no.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.
no, no...
I have to go.
perimeter point six.
all clear.
what are you doing?
when he misses the next check-in, they're gonna know something's wrong.
perimeter point six.
all clear.
I got a plan.
the Black Box can wait.
we're gonna get your mother out...
tonight.
nothing on the hotel guest list matches our guardian.
well, that's our fourth strike.
that's a guardian.
not that I should say this, but...
I kind of wish you were still on the regimen.
so do I.
is that a bad thing?
he's picking up his shirts?
Geranggraeht Hotel Mr. SHOLE, your shirts for pick up.
he's at a four-star hotel.
why would he send his shirts out for cleaning?
Percy loved all that cold war spy crap...
dead drops and code words and...
in two hours, he's gonna be at the dry cleaner's.
maybe then we'll find out where the meeting is.
once we do, I'm pretty sure we got a way inside.
so I'll go in the way I did before...
through the cellar and up the laundry chute, which puts me here... Right outside the bedroom door.
I'll take my mother down the back stairs, and if you wait at this door, we can take the guards out then.
it should buy us enough time before they realize there's a breach.
you're missing something.
how do we get off the estate?
we both got here on foot through the woods.
I don't think that's an option for your mother.
we have to steal a car.
but that could draw too much attention.
depends on the car.
Ari's here, right? - Yeah.
he's got his own car and driver.
only an insane Gogol agent would try and stop Ari Tasarov's car.
how do we know which car is his?
Ari's driver never leaves the car, for security reasons.
I'll deal with him, get behind the wheel...
if they follow us... - They won't.
I'm going to disable all the other cars.
it's a little trick Michael taught me.
if you can delay your enemy for even a few minutes...
it might be enough to win the day. You taught me that.
thank you...
for helping us.
don't thank me yet.
has anyone missed their scheduled check-ins?
no, sir. They've all reported in.
let's be vigilant.
I want you to go out personally and check with your own eyes that everyone is at their posts.
Yes, sir.
I have new information with regards to Ms. Udinov.
I believe she's here...
somewhere on the property.
Amanda thinks that you're going to be able to come up with the scheme to dismantle oversight?
that offends you? - It does, yeah.
I mean, I had them under control.
and then they got to Amanda...
and she got intimidated.
now she's running into the ground everything you took years to build...
well...
you and oversight.
there's always a group behind the group.
division was mine. It was my concept.
snap out of it.
mama, mama...
I found us a way out. It's time to go.
you came back to me.
I'm gonna need you to be strong now.
who is it?
Alex - Mama, it's okay. It's okay. - No!
welcome home, Alexandra.
we have the intruder in custody.
we're bringing her downstairs now.
it is a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance.
well, you'll understand that I can't say the same.
of course, of course.
I've heard that Percy is being held prisoner inside Division.
have you seen him? What's his cell like?
Yes, let's talk about Percy.
I'm curious why he saved you.
and what was he planning to do with you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
you were supposed to die, yet here you are.
why would Division spare your life?
Percy never struck me as a soft touch.
Oh, my God.
that story Yuri told about me being brainwashed...
that wasn't just some cover story.
you actually thought it was true.
I thought it was quite a brilliant plan.
I'm sorry to disappoint.
division didn't rescue me that night... Nikita did.
that... that is the...
rogue agent, yes. She is a soft touch.
I infiltrated Division.
I wanted to make Percy pay.
mission accomplished. He's in a hole.
my new mission is to kill you.
your mission has failed, Alexandra.
night's not over yet.
that's enough. You know where to take her.
is the car out front?
it's time to transport our...
guest.
it's seven o'clock.
I think this is our guy.
I seem to have misplaced my ticket.
what are you picking up?
three shirts... blue...
lightly starched and pressed, boxed.
this isn't a clue to the meeting.
this is the meeting.
I say we bomb the place...
no more guardians, no more Black Boxes.
this meeting is our only chance at figuring out what Percy's up to.
last time he had a big secret plan, he tried to level the seventh floor of the CIA.
so you're gonna walk in there, alone, and meet with two guardians?
we barely managed to take down one of them together.
I'm not going in alone.
we'll be on comms, and that Box is my backup.
be ready when I give the word. - I got ya.
I seem to have misplaced my ticket.
what are you picking up?
three shirts... blue...
lightly starched and pressed, boxed.
you're the other guardian?
when did that happen?
I thought you were Percy's right-hand man.
that's why he chose me.
thanks to Nikita, you guys were dropping like flies, and Percy wanted extra insurance.
right before Amanda took over, he gave me a Box and told me to run.
I don't believe you.
then I'll prove it to you.
can't believe he didn't tell us.
well, things happened pretty fast that day.
are we missing a Box?
I see only two, but there are three of us.
did you lose something?
how'd you go from oversight's golden boy to its chief extortioner?
downside of being invisible?
lack of visibility.
running this place, you've become a deniable asset...
someone who could be wiped away if he stepped out of line.
you needed leverage.
that's what the Black Boxes are for.
but there had to be a catalyst, right?
some incident that soured your relationship with oversight.
well, that reached critical mass with Operation Pale Fire.
in 2005, a Russian conglomerate...Zetrov...
refusing to do business with the United States.
it was a threat to national security?
oversight saw it as a threat to financial security...
theirs, in particular...
so they came to me.
and I discovered that the ceo's number two...
a man named Sergei Semak... Might be pliable.
you turned him...
plotted with him to kill Zetrov's founder...Nikolai Udinov, Alex's father.
I know the backstory.
it was Semak's idea to kill the family.
he said that if he could have control, he would be our man on the inside...
expand U. S. interests throughout his hemisphere.
that's a pretty big promise.
exactly what I said.
I said he couldn't be trusted, and I was right.
he took over...
and reneged on the deal.
Yeah. They want to blame me for it.
now, Amanda and oversight think that Alex is going to take over Zetrov.
well, that ain't gonna happen.
she's going to kill Semak and plunge the company into complete chaos.
Amanda has lost control of her girl.
history does tend to repeat itself.
you say that that mission was when everything went sideways with oversight.
no. No, the real threat wasn't forming over your head.
it was happening right under your nose.
pale Fire was the first time Nikita ever disobeyed orders.
she rescued Alex that night...
her first strike against Division...
and the first step of your journey right into this cage.
you sent Nikita on that mission and sealed your own fate.
how bad is it?
looks worse than it is.
take this, okay?
what are you doing?
wait for my call.
I want you to tell Katya who I am.
you're going back?
I told you, we're getting your mom out tonight.
guardians...
did everyone make it?
three guardians... Present.
open your packets.
visually confirm each other's identity.
maintain security profile Alpha.
we rendezvous in New York in two days.
passport
you're right. I'm not a guardian.
I'm just a guy who rigged a Black Box with explosives.
don't stop until we get to Brussels, just to be safe.
I'm not slowing down till this thing runs out of gas.
Nikita hasn't called me back.
it's been a while.
who are you?
I'm a friend of your daughter's.
I'm here to get you out.
okay?
here...
talk to her.
you will get her killed.
no, she's safe.
I saved her from Ari's men.
I made her safe.
I told Sergei she was here...Not Ari.
Alexandra is sick, very sick.
Yes. - Mr. Tasarov...
we have two guards down at the back of the house.
secure Mr. Semak.
do not leave his side until I tell you otherwise.
have your men sweep the entire house.
someone else is here. Find them.
the Americans took her, and they filled her head with lies...
lies about Sergei.
now she wants to kill him?
Sergei wants your daughter dead.
no.
no, he wants to help her.
we want to put her someplace safe where the doctors can come and heal the damage done to her mind, make her see the truth.
you want to know the truth?
he hired the Americans to wipe out your family so he could take control of Zetrov.
this is a lie.
I was there, Katya.
I was on the strike team. We had everything.
we had alarm codes. We had floor plans.
we had security patrol schedules... All given to us by Semak.
I killed your husband.
no. No, Sergei loves me.
he wanted Zetrov, and he wanted you.
he had me.
we had each other.
you were having an affair.
that's why you survived that night.
it was part of his deal with Percy, wasn't it?
right now you come with me.
I'm not asking.
help?
let's go. - Okay.
you feeling better?
I don't feel anything now...
if that's what you want to know.
you were screaming and tearing the room apart.
you could have hurt yourself. I had to do something.
I've lost her again.
now she'll never come back to me.
let's hope not.
you won't hurt her.
we had a deal.
she and her associate killed half of my men.
I cannot let that stand.
you promised not to hurt Alexandra.
but she's not your Alexandra anymore, Katya.
you must see that now.
I see many things now.
living down here, I've had time to reflect.
you know what I've come to realize?
you like your reflection.
I've seen that I've made mistakes.
but that I can also learn from them.
sometimes all you need is a slight shift in perspective to bring things into focus.
you have had time to reflect.
I've also had time to plan.
against oversight?
I told you, they're irrelevant.
as you said, there's always a group behind the group.
if you look close, you'll see there's a door up there.
where could you possibly go?
to a higher place...
not the place you're thinking of.
brussels, BELGIUM
I think the phone's a dead end.
well, we know they're headed home.
and Roan's running things.
he's how Percy's communicating with them.
we were his insurance policy.
what? - The guardians.
we were the thing that kept Percy alive.
but Percy planned for every contingency.
in the event of his death, we were to upload the Boxes.
maybe in the event of his capture...
you break him out.
I'll stay home until you get here, and we'll figure out the Percy stuff then.
Owen thinks we should let him escape and then shoot him.
that's not a bad idea...
although we'd probably fight over who got to shoot him first.
and we should talk...
about us and...
where we stand.
I'll be here.
you don't have to go on this one.
I can talk to Percy and find another agent for Pale Fire...
maybe Kelly.
Oh, she'd love that.
I'd never hear the end of it.
I know you hate these kinds of missions...
with civilians.
it's important to Percy, right?
it'll be good for me to go.
you're a capable agent.
you don't have to prove that to him anymore.
you once told me that Division was a second chance...
an opportunity to be a new person, make a difference.
this mission...
this is how I prove to myself what kind of person I've become.
you know, for years, I've had...
these memories to hold on to...
an image in my head of what I'd lost.
no matter how bad things got, I could close my eyes, and...
they were there.
that's what got you through.
but it was a lie.
and now I can't even trust my own memories.
her and Semak...
I never had a clue.
you were a kid who loved her parents.
I've wasted so much time and energy...
avenging what?
a father that loved me, but wasn't innocent and...
a mother that...
maybe never loved me at all. - Alex...
I don't understand Katya's choices, but I do think that she loves you.
you can't know that.
she could've been in on Semak's plan all along.
no, I think that she's misguided and not facing reality.
but when she said that she wanted to keep you safe, I believed her.
she was afraid of losing you.
she was more afraid of losing him.
I don't know how to get past that.
you don't have to figure it all out right now.
don't give up on her...
not yet.
I heard you...
on the phone. You...
even after you knew what she did, you still tried to reach her.
people make mistakes.
you know, they make bad choices.
and then to make up for them, they make even worse ones.
but if you give them a second chance, sometimes they surprise you.
Yeah.
sometimes they do.
operation Pale Fire.
division collaborated with Sergei Semak to kill Nikolai Udinov and his family.
I saved the daughter, Alexandra.
your partner?
that's why she's working with you to take down the Division.
her focus has shifted. - Revenge.
that's where I'm going...
to get the man who ordered my parents to die.
and I'm going to kill him.
mom?
the guardians... they're gathering, and Percy is behind it.
we don't know if anything is happening with Percy, but what we do know is that Ari has the Box.
I'll go after the guardian. You go after Ari.
and you'll be fine with him.
no. Michael goes with you.
you're chasing Ari Tasarov into the heart of Gogol territory.
you don't even know where he's headed.
Yeah, she does. I put a tracker on his car.
I don't know what I'm going to find there, but it's the right thing to do.
Hello, Ari.
operation Pale Fire...
background is need-to-know.
this is the target zone.
these are the Tangos...
peration PALE FIRE
Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear.
our man on the inside has provided extensive Intel to the layout of the home and all the security measures that are in place.
Papa Bear likes to maintain a semblance of normalcy for his family, so the estate grounds will be far more heavily guarded than inside the house itself.
patrols will be shifted to the North, so you will come up through the woods from the South, up the drive, and into the front door.
current alarm codes will be in your briefing packet.
review the material, be ready in two hours.
dismissed.
Roan, stay back a minute.
is there a problem?
how?
how?
mama...
I thought you were dead.
they said, mother down.
no. Nikolai... he heard men downstairs...
shooting. He left me.
I can't remember.
I saw a gun.
I woke up in hospital.
you were dead.
everyone was dead.
my baby girl, my baby girl!
it's okay, Momma.
I made it out. We both did.
I'm right here.
how?
someone took me.
she saved my life.
bingo.
Michael: Have eyes on box. They're trying to crack it. May see a way to grab!
AMESTERDAM, HOLLAND
what's that? Update for Nikata.
she's found the Black Box.
I know you guys want to replace the Box you lost, but maybe she should just let it goe
we can't let Ari keep that Box.
if he finds a way to decrypt it, I don't want to think about what he'd do with those dirty secrets.
you should be with her.
I could've tracked this guardian on my own.
he's going to meet up with the other guardians.
you want to take on all three by yourself?
no. Nikita was right.
we got to grab that Box and then figure out what the guardians are up to...
what Percy's up to.
What'd you find?
I narrowed it down to these six hotels.
those are some nice places.
I thought the guardians were more "bed of nails" and all.
easier to get lost in a crowd at a big hotel.
these are the right size, near public transportation, with multiple points of egress.
okay, so we zero him down, track him to the gathering, and figure out how Percy's pulling the strings.
why are you still in London? - Excuse me?
Nikita says you're staying in London to be with the kid.
is that gonna be a permanent thing or...?
why is she even talking to you about this?
she needs to talk to somebody.
it's getting harder for her.
maybe she can't talk to you'cause she thinks she already lost you.
she hasn't. - I know.
that's why I'm warning you.
you need to make a choice before someone makes it for you.
and who's gonna make that for me...
you?
I don't have a kid.
you killed her fiance.
Yeah. Nikita said he was a nice, normal guy...
didn't deserve to die...
neither did Emily.
she was innocent, just like your son.
she died because of me, because that's what happens when normal people get sucked into our world.

mama, have you been here all these years...
in this house?
what happened?
I have to hide.

I'm attending to some business.

I should've killed Semak when I had the chance.
Alexandra... - It's okay, mama.
I understand now.
Semak was always jealous of papa.
he always wanted everything papa had, so he took it.
he can have Zetrov, but he can't have you...
not anymore.
I just don't understand.
I have to leave for a few minutes, but I'll be right back.
just stay here.
we are leaving.

I'm curious why he saved you.
and what was he planning to do with you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
you were supposed to die, yet here you are.
why would Division spare your life?
Percy never struck me as a soft touch.
Oh, my God.
that story Yuri told about me being brainwashed...
that wasn't just some cover story.
you actually thought it was true.
I thought it was quite a brilliant plan.
I'm sorry to disappoint.
division didn't rescue me that night... Nikita did.
that... that is the...
rogue agent, yes. She is a soft touch.
I infiltrated Division.
I wanted to make Percy pay.
mission accomplished. He's in a hole.
my new mission is to kill you.
your mission has failed, Alexandra.
night's not over yet.
that's enough. You know where to take her.
is the car out front?
it's time to transport our...
guest.
it's seven o'clock.
I think this is our guy.
I seem to have misplaced my ticket.
what are you picking up?
three shirts... blue...
lightly starched and pressed, boxed.
this isn't a clue to the meeting.
this is the meeting.
I say we bomb the place...
no more guardians, no more Black Boxes.
this meeting is our only chance at figuring out what Percy's up to.
last time he had a big secret plan, he tried to level the seventh floor of the CIA.
so you're gonna walk in there, alone, and meet with two guardians?
we barely managed to take down one of them together.
I'm not going in alone.
we'll be on comms, and that Box is my backup.
be ready when I give the word. - I got ya.
I seem to have misplaced my ticket.
what are you picking up?
three shirts... blue...
lightly starched and pressed, boxed.
you're the other guardian?
when did that happen?
I thought you were Percy's right-hand man.
that's why he chose me.
thanks to Nikita, you guys were dropping like flies, and Percy wanted extra insurance.
right before Amanda took over, he gave me a Box and told me to run.
I don't believe you.
then I'll prove it to you.
can't believe he didn't tell us.
well, things happened pretty fast that day.
are we missing a Box?
I see only two, but there are three of us.
did you lose something?
how'd you go from oversight's golden boy to its chief extortioner?
downside of being invisible?
lack of visibility.
running this place, you've become a deniable asset...
someone who could be wiped away if he stepped out of line.
you needed leverage.
that's what the Black Boxes are for.
but there had to be a catalyst, right?
some incident that soured your relationship with oversight.
well, that reached critical mass with Operation Pale Fire.
in 2005, a Russian conglomerate...Zetrov...
refusing to do business with the United States.
it was a threat to national security?
oversight saw it as a threat to financial security...
theirs, in particular...
so they came to me.
and I discovered that the ceo's number two...
a man named Sergei Semak... Might be pliable.
you turned him...
plotted with him to kill Zetrov's founder...Nikolai Udinov, Alex's father.
I know the backstory.
it was Semak's idea to kill the family.
he said that if he could have control, he would be our man on the inside...
expand U. S. interests throughout his hemisphere.
that's a pretty big promise.
exactly what I said.
I said he couldn't be trusted, and I was right.
he took over...
and reneged on the deal.
Yeah. They want to blame me for it.
now, Amanda and oversight think that Alex is going to take over Zetrov.
well, that ain't gonna happen.
she's going to kill Semak and plunge the company into complete chaos.
Amanda has lost control of her girl.
history does tend to repeat itself.
you say that that mission was when everything went sideways with oversight.
no. No, the real threat wasn't forming over your head.
it was happening right under your nose.
pale Fire was the first time Nikita ever disobeyed orders.
she rescued Alex that night...
her first strike against Division...
and the first step of your journey right into this cage.
you sent Nikita on that mission and sealed your own fate.
how bad is it?
looks worse than it is.
take this, okay?
what are you doing?
wait for my call.
I want you to tell Katya who I am.
you're going back?
I told you, we're getting your mom out tonight.
guardians...
did everyone make it?
three guardians... Present.
open your packets.
visually confirm each other's identity.
maintain security profile Alpha.
we rendezvous in New York in two days.
passport
you're right. I'm not a guardian.
I'm just a guy who rigged a Black Box with explosives.
don't stop until we get to Brussels, just to be safe.
I'm not slowing down till this thing runs out of gas.
Nikita hasn't called me back.
it's been a while.
who are you?
I'm a friend of your daughter's.
I'm here to get you out.
okay?
here...
talk to her.
you will get her killed.
no, she's safe.
I saved her from Ari's men.
I made her safe.
I told Sergei she was here...Not Ari.
Alexandra is sick, very sick.
Yes. - Mr. Tasarov...
we have two guards down at the back of the house.
secure Mr. Semak.
do not leave his side until I tell you otherwise.
have your men sweep the entire house.
someone else is here. Find them.
the Americans took her, and they filled her head with lies...
lies about Sergei.
now she wants to kill him?
Sergei wants your daughter dead.
no.
no, he wants to help her.
we want to put her someplace safe where the doctors can come and heal the damage done to her mind, make her see the truth.
you want to know the truth?
he hired the Americans to wipe out your family so he could take control of Zetrov.
this is a lie.
I was there, Katya.
I was on the strike team. We had everything.
we had alarm codes. We had floor plans.
we had security patrol schedules... All given to us by Semak.
I killed your husband.
no. No, Sergei loves me.
he wanted Zetrov, and he wanted you.
he had me.
we had each other.
you were having an affair.
that's why you survived that night.
it was part of his deal with Percy, wasn't it?
right now you come with me.
I'm not asking.
help?
let's go. - Okay.
you feeling better?
I don't feel anything now...
if that's what you want to know.
you were screaming and tearing the room apart.
you could have hurt yourself. I had to do something.
I've lost her again.
now she'll never come back to me.
let's hope not.
you won't hurt her.
we had a deal.
she and her associate killed half of my men.
I cannot let that stand.
you promised not to hurt Alexandra.
but she's not your Alexandra anymore, Katya.
you must see that now.
I see many things now.
living down here, I've had time to reflect.
you know what I've come to realize?
you like your reflection.
I've seen that I've made mistakes.
but that I can also learn from them.
sometimes all you need is a slight shift in perspective to bring things into focus.
you have had time to reflect.
I've also had time to plan.
against oversight?
I told you, they're irrelevant.
as you said, there's always a group behind the group.
if you look close, you'll see there's a door up there.
where could you possibly go?
to a higher place...
not the place you're thinking of.
brussels, BELGIUM
I think the phone's a dead end.
well, we know they're headed home.
and Roan's running things.
he's how Percy's communicating with them.
we were his insurance policy.
what? - The guardians.
we were the thing that kept Percy alive.
but Percy planned for every contingency.
in the event of his death, we were to upload the Boxes.
maybe in the event of his capture...
you break him out.
I'll stay home until you get here, and we'll figure out the Percy stuff then.
Owen thinks we should let him escape and then shoot him.
that's not a bad idea...
although we'd probably fight over who got to shoot him first.
and we should talk...
about us and...
where we stand.
I'll be here.
you don't have to go on this one.
I can talk to Percy and find another agent for Pale Fire...
maybe Kelly.
Oh, she'd love that.
I'd never hear the end of it.
I know you hate these kinds of missions...
with civilians.
it's important to Percy, right?
it'll be good for me to go.
you're a capable agent.
you don't have to prove that to him anymore.
you once told me that Division was a second chance...
an opportunity to be a new person, make a difference.
this mission...
this is how I prove to myself what kind of person I've become.
you know, for years, I've had...
these memories to hold on to...
an image in my head of what I'd lost.
no matter how bad things got, I could close my eyes, and...
they were there.
that's what got you through.
but it was a lie.
and now I can't even trust my own memories.
her and Semak...
I never had a clue.
you were a kid who loved her parents.
I've wasted so much time and energy...
avenging what?
a father that loved me, but wasn't innocent and...
a mother that...
maybe never loved me at all. - Alex...
I don't understand Katya's choices, but I do think that she loves you.
you can't know that.
she could've been in on Semak's plan all along.
no, I think that she's misguided and not facing reality.
but when she said that she wanted to keep you safe, I believed her.
she was afraid of losing you.
she was more afraid of losing him.
I don't know how to get past that.
you don't have to figure it all out right now.
don't give up on her...
not yet.
I heard you...
on the phone. You...
even after you knew what she did, you still tried to reach her.
people make mistakes.
you know, they make bad choices.
and then to make up for them, they make even worse ones.
but if you give them a second chance, sometimes they surprise you.
Yeah.
sometimes they do.
OVERSIHHT GEMINI MODELING MERCE
according to the Box, each mission is authorized by Oversight.
Nikita knows I'm a member of Oversight.
the sooner I take down Nikita, the sooner you're safe.
you said you had a way to get to her through Alex.
it belonged to your father. - Thank you.
then activate the plan immediately.
gates HOUSE OVERSIGHT
the situation is critical.
our entire effort, everything that we have worked for is in danger of being destroyed, and why?
because of one person.
she is determined to bring down Division at all costs, and she feels the quickest way to do that is to target its sponsors.
two of us are dead now...
thanks to her, and she won't stop until we join them.
I could go to the president, request secret service protection.
tell him what?
that the shadow government that he's not even aware of can't stop an assassin that it created?
you going to track all that sand in here again?
I'm not the maid, you know.
clearly.
you know, Division doesn't even need to kill you.
you're doing just fine on your own.
what's the update on the guardians?
well, your boy Owen lost track of the last two somewhere near Brussels.
I'm helping him out with sat surveillance, but it's like trying to find a needle in a needle stack.
Mikey's on his way back here.
he thinks the guardians are en route to the states.
to break Percy out of Division?
well, their Black Boxes are gone.
what else is a'roid-raging Terminator going to do with his spare time?
speaking of meds...
I caught our little house guest trying to swipe my pain pills.
thought you should know.
you know, you can stay here as long as you want, but if your plan is to get high again, you're going to have to do it somewhere else.
those were one of the things my mom was taking, you know, to make herself numb and push the pain away.
the truth.
Alex, I was a part of the operation against your family that night, and even I don't know the truth.
maybe she doesn't either.
she was having an affair with the man who killed my father, and she is living with him in the house that I grew up in.
doesn't mean that she was part of the attack or the takeover.
it doesn't matter.
Alex, you're going to have to find a way to let this go.
I'm not saying let her go.
then what are you saying? - I'm saying I...
I understand.
more than you know.
before Division, there was a woman at a halfway house.
her name was Carla.
"this is a safe place," she used to say.
and I remember, hearing that meant so much to me.
and then, one day, she left town.
no good-bye.
no nothing.
what happened?
I fell to pieces.
off the wagon and landed in prison.
Yeah.
all I remember thinking was that she never came to visit me on death row, not once.
and I remember feeling like I would never forgive her for that.
and I thought there has to be a reason why she did what she did.
and whatever that reason was,
I think it was supposed to help me.
you can stay here.
this is a safe place.
one rogue element is not the problem.
Bruce, she won't give up.
put it another way, she's not the only problem.
well, we're on the subject of disasters, let's talk about Alexander Udinov.
I seem to recall her sitting down with us and striking a deal.
we help her take revenge against Sergei Semak, she neutralizes Nikita.
neither of which has happened.
whose fault is that?
well, you're making my point.
the problem, as you say, is deeper. Systemic.
Amanda, Nikita, Alex.
what do they have in common?
division. - Our problem is Division.
maybe we need new leadership.
we already tried that.
Amanda was no better than Percy.
division's grown too powerful for anyone to run it.
no, no. What we require here is something more drastic.
and we all know what it is.
clean sweep.
division HEADQUARTERS RURAL NEW JERSEY
you're a little late.
Really? Have you figured out a way to tell time down here?
I just would've thought, after conferring with your asset, that you'd come straight down.
there's nothing you told Ryan Fletcher that you didn't want me to hear.
his prediction is that you're planning an escape, which we both know is impossible.
impossible is a word found only in the dictionary of fools.
you're a little tall to be quoting Napoleon.
his exile did last nearly a year and, you're right.
I'm not that patient.
well, take a look around, Percy.
there is no way out of here.
no way that you can see, but you will, before this day is done.
and my favorite part is, there's nothing you can do to stop it.
not long ago, I received reliable Intel on a major threat against Division, most likely an attack on this facility.
I have reason to believe it will occur within the next 24 hours.
I am putting Division on high alert.
as of now, nobody will be allowed in or out without my approval.
I want to remind you that this bunker was built to withstand a Soviet nuclear strike.
we can handle anything that is thrown at us.
that does not mean, however, that we will sit back and play defense.
the sooner we identify the threat, the sooner we eliminate it.
call General Turgeson at Stratcom.
tell him I need a satellite re-tasked.
where to? - Directly above us.
I want to see everything within a five mile radius.
establish a perimeter above ground.
every person, every vehicle needs to be accounted for.
even if one of that farmer's Holsteins wanders onto our land up there,
I want it checked out.
get to it!
Sean. - We just did another perimeter sweep. Everything's clear.
I need to speak with you.
look, I know you rejected the idea of taking over Division.
mother, I don't have time for this now.
just hear me out!
what about dismantling it?
oversee the re-assignment of personnel, a temporary post.
I don't want any post at Division.
then a lot of people are going to die.
they're talking about a clean sweep in there.
complete liquidation of the facility, including all personnel.
mass murder.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
I'm going to try and talk them down, but I'm already outnumbered three-to-one.
when are they thinking of doing this?
soon. I've called for a break, but I don't know how long I can hold them off.
where are you going?
I may have a lead on Nikita.
how?
so the tracker you placed on Alex?
Alex has nothing to do with this, but it's a solid lead.
I need you now, Sean.
I'll do it. I'll dismantle Division.
maybe after today, that's all we'll have left to do.
Thanks.
when's Michael getting here? - Soon.
how are you two doing?
I don't know.
none of my business.
no.
I mean, I don't know.
things were great. We were a team again.
then we hit a snag in Belarus, and what?
Belarus? When were you in Belarus?
couple of months ago. We were getting the first lady out.
we were there too, at the exact same time.
who's we? - Me and Sean Pierce.
Sean Pierce? - Yeah, we were taking out the Dictator Ovechkin.
what? - He had it coming. We made it look like the bodyguard did it.
after Michael snapped that dude's neck.
that was Michael?
he almost got me killed.
well, your car bomb almost got Michael and I killed, so I think we're even.
close call. - Way too close.
hate to interrupt you ladies reliving your spyjinks, but I could use a little help on our current mission.
the guardians didn't just decide to do this on their own.
Percy's got to be pulling the strings somehow.
how?
he's in complete isolation in a glass cube at the bottom of the silo.
he doesn't talk to anybody?
only me and Amanda.
any chance those two could be teaming up, you think?
there's no way.
I mean, he would ask to speak to me instead of her.
they're like divorced parents, and I'm the kid stuck in the middle.
he's never had you, relay any messages or pass anything to anyone?
no, I would never.
money I used to get to Russia.
wait, you weren't funded by Division?
no, Amanda kept dangling the carrot and I got sick of waiting.
Percy gave me a cut of a bank transfer.
an electronic bank transfer.
it was my fault.
bader FIELD TRENTDN , NEW JERSEY
what's the occasion, fellas?
the occasion?
well, most people book a jump for a birthday or an anniversary or a midlife crisis.
just want to see the countryside.
well, you're going to see new Jersey like you've never seen it before.
place will almost look clean.
anyway, I know you guys are licensed, but I still got to give you the safety spiel.
it's rare, but accidents do happen.
you'll be staggered around the perimeter in teams of two.
keep your eyes and ears open.
we'll hit them before they even know we're there.
we're just about to board.
should be taking off shortly.
safe travels. See you soon.
I have a proposition for you.
we could save lives and ammunition if you tell me your scheme, and I'll make sure you get that room with a view you requested.
better idea, you take me up to operations, tell everyone there's been a little mistake, and that I'm back in charge.
for your sake as well as mine.
you know Oversight is out to get you.
my relations with them might be strained, but it is nothing I can't handle.
Oh, stop it.
they played you. I had them handled.
why do you think they were so eager to get rid of me?
maybe those private deals you were doing on the side.
they gave me no choice.
nickel-and-diming me at every turn, trying to save a dollar at the expense of national security.
and your personal bank account?
this was never about the money for me.
what, then? The power?
you wouldn't understand. - Try me.
no.
no, it's like trying to explain Alpha behavior to a lap dog.
cause that's what you've been acting like.
no ambition. No vision. No master plan.
admit it, whether it's Oversight or me, you prefer the submissive position.
release me. We join forces and the Boxes protect both of us.
it's just good business.
Oh, you know better than that. You know this is personal.
Hey, occupy beach house.
can you grab me a fresh one of these?
you want ice?
I prefer mine neat.
Hey, about the pills. It won't happen again.
I'm sure it won't.
Thanks.
I'm going to run to the store.
do you want anything like bread, milk, actual food?
beer. I know you got I. D.
security ALERT: MAIN GATE
head's up. We got someone at the gate.
it's Michael.
how's it going, buddy?
well, you know what they say.
whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
I always thought that was a load of crap.
Yeah, no kidding.
however...
didn't expect to see you here, Alex.
Yeah, me either.
I heard about Russia.
Yeah, no place like home, right?
you know, I couldn't have gone through it without Nikita.
I'm going to let you two talk.
Yeah, I've got, uh, that thing to check on too.
look, Michael, what I did in London, I did what I always do.
I made the decision for you and...
Hey, no, it's okay.
it was a good thing.
I needed some time.
I've gotten to know Max now.
he's a bright kid.
and he's starting to get to know me.
but even when we were, I don't know, in the park, kicking around a soccer ball,
I found myself looking over my shoulder, wondering and I can't live like that.
I don't think anyone can live like that.
we have to end this fight that we're in, once and for all.
but we beat them and then... then what?
stop, stop.
no. You stop.
let's get him inside.
Where's your back-up? Where's Division?
Birkhoff, give me the binos. I'm going up on the roof.
damn it. We just got here.
you know how much ballistic glass costs?
Kevlar blinds?
we are not leaving a Navy seal alive if we're fighting off an Alpha team.
he's right. They come busting through that door, you're the first one we drop.
he's clean. No tracker, no comms.
if they were here, they'd have attacked already.
they're not out there, are they?
no tracker, no comms, no back-up.
nobody knows where you are, and you don't want us to know that.
how'd you find us?
he must have followed me.
it's the only thing that makes sense.
you used me, I know it. How'd you do it?
how?
must have put a tracker in it.
my father's watch?
my father's watch?
we got to smash it.
Hey, hey, no, no, I can get it out.
I can get it out without smashing it. Give it to me.
not even your mother's going to save you now.
his mother?
Yes, his mother is a member of Oversight.
he didn't tell you that?
you are full of surprises.
I almost wish you'd tracked me down with an Alpha team instead.
that way I could use you as a body shield.
why didn't you bring them?
Why?
I didn't want you to get hurt.
how did it ever get to this?
when you kept operation sparrow from me.
that was for your own protection.
or else you would have ended up in the adjoining cube.
it's the truth.
no, here's the truth.
we were a great team, you and I.
no one could have run Division better than we did.
but you weren't satisfied, you wanted more, so little by little, you became less about the country and more about you.
it was always about me. I created Division.
it never would have thrived without me.
I never denied your contribution.
then why don't you treat me as an equal?
because you weren't one.
I was the don and you were the Consigliore.
I valued your counsel, and that's as far as it went.
maybe in your eyes.
no, I know. You saw this as a relationship.
and you encouraged the recruits to view us as mommy and daddy.
and somewhere along the way, you deluded yourself into thinking you had feelings for me, when all you ever loved was my power.
we had something.
we had nothing.
it couldn't happen because you're incapable of love.
just remember, Percy.
I gave you a chance.
ground.
gun
received word from roan.
he advises we approach from the west.
I say we cap him.
it's not like we can ever let him go. He knows where we are.
we let seal team six-pack there leave, he's going to roll right back at us with the cavalry.
why kill him if we can use him as a bargaining chip?
we've all seen how far he's willing to go for his mother.
let's see how far his mother's willing to go for him.
I don't think the other members of Oversight give a damn about this guy.
when push comes to shove, they'd save their own skins over his.
I say we keep him tied up and leave him.
by the time anyone came here, we'd be gone.
are you kidding me?
this guy takes a shot at us and we have to move?
this isn't Sean's fault.
what?
I always wondered what a guy like that was doing at Division.
now I know. He'd do anything to protect his mother.
great, so he's Norman bates. Let's add him to the team.
Birkhoff, he's wrong. He doesn't deserve to die.
you want to know about my time in Division? Here it is.
Sean came to me asking for the truth about Ryan Fletcher.
this guy has his doubts.
he's never heard our side of the story.
maybe we should give it to him.
try to convince him we're not the bad guys.
you really think you can turn a Navy seal?
I think we have some common ground.
if you want to make peace, you don't talk to your friends.
you talk to your enemies.
before you consider wiping out Division, there is the problem of Percy.
I hadn't thought of that.
the dead man's switch on his heart, upload the Black Boxes.
not exactly a "clean sweep," if our operation is exposed to the public.
if Percy's not exposed, neither are we.
Amanda's got him at the old titan-2 silo, sealed off in the bunker, so he's shielded from the attack.
if my son has agreed to supervise a phase down, why are we even debating this?
Debating? I thought we were just working out the details.
there has to be a better option.
consider the alternative.
when we moved back into Iraq, first thing we did was disband Saddam's army.
those men, every one of them, became our mortal enemies.
killed thousands of our soldiers.
what would happen if we tried to disband Division?
a group of the world's most highly trained killers, set loose on the country?
is that what you want?
Kenneth, bring in the case, please.
Bruce, we have a duty.
for the citizens of this country, to protect them against all threats, foreign and domestic,
division has become a domestic threat.
you look thirsty, soldier. Can I get you some water?
Sean... this isn't an interrogation.
it's a conversation.
what do you know about me?
I know you're trying to kill my mother.
I've never killed a member of Oversight.
you have. All Oversight does is fund Division, and we both know that that place doesn't deserve to be in business any longer.
let me ask you a question.
what would have happened if you had succeeded in killing us?
what then?
you think they'd let you go back to your seal unit?
they know if they go after me, I'll go straight to the authorities.
you would never get that far.
if they feel you're a danger, not even your mother can help you.
and, if she objected too strongly, she'd suffer the same fate as her son.
you've seen how Oversight eats their own.
you're protecting her from the wrong people.
and who are you? The right people?
nice to meet you. Now, let's try this again.
you look thirsty, soldier. Can I get you some water?
senator Pierce, please.
escape. You're certain about this?
he told me. - He told you?
let's not forget who we're talking about.
what precautions are you taking?
many, but I only need your approval on one.
I'd like to place Percy into a medically-induced coma.
what does that mean, exactly?
I'll administer a cocktail that will make him the equivalent of brain dead.
his dead-man's switch won't be activated because his heart will continue to beat.
you're the one who wanted to keep him conscious in the first place, Amanda.
seems that was the wrong call.
you have our approval.
I'd ask you to hand me that, but...
here, just...
beats waterboarding.
you had that coming, you know.
I know.
you know, sometimes, you do things in these situations you're not proud of.
but you did it anyway.
it wasn't like me.
that's why it worked.
how did you know I'd meet Nikita in Russia?
I didn't.
so you wanted me to go after Semak.
and you didn't tell Amanda?
it was what you wanted.
why do you care?
being posted at Division, it's not my choice, it's my duty.
if I couldn't leave, the least I could do was help you get out.
you sure you want to turn on that thing?
relax. This place has more jamming than a Santana concert.
I followed your progress in Russia for a while. What happened?
I failed.
how? - I trusted someone I shouldn't have.
my mother. You must know what that's like.
wait a second, your mother is alive?
Semak keeps her out of site, strung out on pills.
she's his prisoner?
not exactly.
you can't judge family the same way you do other people, especially when they're in trouble.
Oh, yeah? How's that working out for you?
so far, so good.
ahoy, shipwreck. You know you've got a bug in your phone?
what? - What?
initiate ACTIVATION CODE
device ACTIVATION COMPLETE OPERATION CODE 5532, FREQ CHANNEL 0052, SYSTEM SETTINOS 0552 STATUS: ARMED
were they tapping my phone conversations?
they were bugging you whenever you had your phone on.
call or no call. - Amanda.
my mother told me Oversight wasn't happy with her, that they were looking for new leadership.
she was listening.
wait a minute. Oversight's unhappy with Amanda?
that's great.
Yeah, if you're okay with mass murder then, by all means, enjoy the show.
what are you talking about?
oversight is thinking about executing clean sweep.
wait, clean sweep? What the hell is that?
years ago, when Percy created Division,
oversight insisted he build in a failsafe, so he could erase the evidence at any time.
there's a tanker of VX gas tapped into Division's ventilation system.
20 minutes after Oversight pulls the trigger, the place will be a mass grave.
nobody would ever find it, because nobody even knew it was there.
all those people...
you mean all those people you're trying to kill, right?
the hell we were. That was us once.
they're not there by choice.
we wouldn't have killed the foot soldiers if we'd captured their leaders.
we tie them to their crimes, and send them over to the authorities.
why is Oversight doing this? They sound panicked.
black Boxes, rogue agents, failure to catch Nikita.
thanks to you, Division has become expendable.
my mother's trying to stop it, but she's the sole voice of dissent.
she has no leverage.
she's about to get some. Birkhoff, set up a scrambler.
we're going to call Oversight.
thanks to you, we have the number.
what are you going to tell them?
I'm going to tell them that they trigger clean sweep, we upload the Black Box.
it's something they can't clean.
last time I checked, we don't have one of those.
they don't know that.
and, luckily, we have someone they trust.
you don't have to make that call.
I will.
can you talk? Good.
I'm taking certain steps and I wanted to make you aware because it changes the plan.
we're inside the perimeter.
take a good look around.
these are the last people that you will see for a long, long time.
maybe ever.
aren't you forgetting something?
the Boxes are irrelevant.
you know what happens when I die?
you're not going to.
the pentobarbital will slow your metabolic rate, as well as your cerebral blood flow.
you may end up with some brain damage, but I'll try to avoid that.
you know I never wanted this.
then don't do it.
for old times' sake?
for yours.

Sean, you have to get back here right now.
that depends entirely on you.
is he alive?
for now.
I'm here. They got me.
listen, I told them about clean sweep and they have other plans.
if Oversight implements the protocol, they will upload the contents of a Black Box.
what Black Box? You destroyed it.
somehow they managed to get their hands on another.
I'm looking right at it.
look, I know this isn't the solution that you wanted, but it might be the one that we...
what the hell was that?
we have to get out of here now.
on your knees!
mother? Mother?
one must have a mind of winter, and been cold a long...
who are we dealing with here?
I take my orders from the same man I always have, even after you threw him down a hole.
I recognize that voice. It's one of the guardians.
that's why they were gathering. Their target was Oversight.
Hello?
I want to make this very quick because you don't have much time.
release Percy or you will eliminate all the members of Oversight?
sounds good to me.
keep listening.
failure to comply will result in the activation of clean sweep.
they've got the button at hand, as they always do, which means now, it's at my hand.
if you attempt evacuation, we trigger it immediately.
you wouldn't.
I told you. Division is mine or no one's.
you had your chance.
there's nothing you can do to stop this.

Yeah, I'm aware of that.
you looking for me?
not anymore.
well, good.
then get your ass off my paint.

Hey, you got a hearing problem?
911 Emergency
Yes, I'd like to report the brutal and senseless murder of a newark police detective.
I forgot how good you are when you're angry.
I forgot how easy you are to beat.
nice try.
I can't believe I made it.
two division tails.
the one on the train and one on the street.
I think the satellites are hot, too.
I got ten minutes. Tops.
Amanda has you under surveillance? What are you doing here?
I asked her to come.
what's the update?
Amanda definitely has complete control of division.
she's strutting around the place like she just won top model.
no oversight, no boundaries.
and you wanna know what she's doing with all that power?
nothing.
no missions have been activated, nothing is in prep.
the only thing she's running is the propaganda machine.
I mean, look at it. Oversight gets wiped out, but nobody's the wiser.

she's turned it into a national tragedy.
the world thinks that some anti-government wacko did it.
that can't be all she's up to.
Oh, I asked her.
she says that I should think of division as a boutique agency.
only the most vital missions. - Vital to whom?
and why is she telling you this?
there is one mission she's prepping.
she wants to help me get my mother out of Russia.
says she has a plan.
okay, listen to her. And then say no.
she can't, she won't.
I wouldn't.
are you saying that I should do it?
well, I'm saying that if you want to get your mother out of Russia, it's better that amanda works with you instead of against you.
keep your enemies closer. Right?
if you get close to amanda, you'd better know what she's up to.
she wants Zetrov.
and I'm the perfect way for her to do that.
so what happens when you change your plans?
we'll blow that bridge when we come to it.
for now it's a - It's a smart plan.

slain Detective Was Involved In Death Row Case
Newark police detective peter edmonds was shot and killed outside this local bar last night and the case has a bizarre and shocking twist.
you're looking at the late nikita mears, runaway and drug addict sentenced to death for killing newark police officer eric deros, detective edmonds's partner some ten years ago.
Mears was executed by the state of new jersey,
for Nikita but apparently she's still got some fans.
a 911 call wasn't any help in identifying the shooter.
could you tell us your name, sir?
I'd like to remain anonymous.
what the hell is he doing? Trying to expose you?
no.
because that would expose division and he still wants that back.
Nikita, what did you want?
you don't have a choice! - Get back!
shut up!
he's trying to shake me up.
Newark police detective peter edmonds was shot and killed outside this local bar last night and the case has a bizarre and shocking twist.
senator madeline pierce's office, please hold.
sentenced to death for killing newark police officer Eric Deros.
detective edmonds's partner some ten years ago.
news has been posted. I can see that.
thank you for hold.
Yes, would you tell her an old friend from division is calling to see if she's okay?
she'll want to pick up.
it's from the senator's office.
going secure.
I have percy on the line.
can you trace it through your equipment?
Percy called your office? What does he want?
he wants to speak with you.
transfer it.
I take it you got my message.
Yeah, it was subtle, but I caught it.
I'm glad the senator could help facilitate this call.
it shows she still has some use left.
what do you want? - I'm seeing the appeal.
being on the road, on the run.
it's exciting. - Percy, what do you want?
well, just that it occurred to me as we are both rogue now that we share a common enemy.
the only person I want to kill more than amanda is you.
I was afraid you were gonna say that.
I like you afraid. - No.
I am afraid for you.
you see, Nikita, I had a plan to overthrow amanda and restore order to division.
but your vindictiveness has denied me that.
so now I'm gonna have to hurt you.
Oh, you wanna meet on the playground after school?
all right, I'm in.
you're not listening.
you took something from me and now I'm going to take something from you.
someone you love, because now I'm feeling vindictive.
bring it on.
all the people I love carry guns.
not carla bennett.
Hello? Anyone there?
she abandoned me. I don't care about her.
no, of course you don't care about the woman who got you clean.
the woman you loved so much you wanted to call her mom.
sweetheart, I know more about you than you know about yourself, and I'm gonna use it to cause you pain.
you won't be able to find her.
one good thing about not having division anymore is that I need only focus on one operation at a time.
you wanted daddy's attention, you got it.
so, then he looks at me and he says...
NWEARK 10 YEARS AGO.You're hired.
what?
Oh, you did it! - Yeah.
I, start tomorrow.
that hospital needs somebody just like you.
I mean you have helped me so much since you've come here.
I mean look at how much this place has changed.
I'm scared, carla.
when he said I got the job, I...
just wanted to run.
that's because you have been told all your life that you're not worth it.
and when you're young and you hear that over and over again, that starts to sink in.
but you are so much stronger now.
you're a wildflower.
wildflowers, they grow in the desert.
the most horrible place on the planet.
because they save their strength and they wait for the rain to come.
and they reach for the sun and they bloom.
and that's what you're gonna do, nikita.
you're gonna bloom.
why are you doing this for me?
because one day you're gonna do this for somebody else.
that's the way it's supposed to work.
okay.
Carla bennett got me clean.
she was the only good thing I had in my life till division made me who I am.
I'm not gonna let percy hurt her.
Nikita, you know this is a trap.
what choice do I have?
he says he's gonna go after her he's gonna go after her.
he's using you to get her into the open.
what if he's already on to Carla, and he's
waiting for us when we get there?
Oh, I hope he is, Michael.
I really, really do.
you don't owe this woman anything.
she abandoned you, she let you down.
no.
I let her down.
I just don't like to think about it.
what are you talking about?
Carla got me clean.
but I relapsed.
I was really sick, Michael.
I couldn't let go of my life.
I couldn't forgive.
and then the job.
the new job was too much.
so I ran.
I got high.
and I went back to find her.
I needed help.
there were a couple of cops there.
that's when things got out of control.
you shot one of them, that part I know.
Yeah.
Carla was on the run from a drug charge in another state.
she was an addict too. Before.
after that night she had to run again.
it was my fault.
is that why you haven't been looking for her?
I wanted division dead and gone so that my life wouldn't affect her life.
same way that you don't want any of this to come down on your son.
okay.
if she's underground...
it's going to be difficult to track her.
but we'll find her.
how's this gonna work exactly? - You'll see.
I'm glad you're taking me up on this, Alex.
I just need to know one thing.
what's that?
there will be no more rogue behavior.
no running off half-cocked to do this all by yourself.
we're working together.

your reappearance as alexandra udinov will raise a lot of questions.

nice headline.
maybe I'll have the paparazzi follow me around.
how's that gonna bring down semak?
it will paralyze him.
your very existence puts semak in a precarious position.
the only reason he has control of zetrov is because the world believes all of the udinovs are dead.
everything he has is rightfully yours.
I just want my mother away from him.
I don't want the company.
we know that. Semak doesn't.
that's your power.
we cannot escape our destiny.
it calls to us.
and if we don't respond, it finds us.
as the lone survivor of this horrific attack, my destiny is to ensure that this kind of tragedy never befalls us again.
and yet I find myself searching for strength.
I'm reminded of one of my constituents.
a woman who helped those less fortunate than her.
she used to say,"wildflowers survive in the desert because"they save their strength.
they wait for the rain, they reach for the sun.
and finally they bloom.
senator Pierce Statement on Gates House
I would very much like to hear from this wonderful woman again.
she has the strength that will help me face my destiny.
thank you.
clever, clever.
they brought you in through the tunnels?
everything went like clockwork.
it's been a bit of a madhouse here.
so you've had some calls?
too many.
you make one appeal to talk to a constituent, the phone starts ringing off the hook.
I can't thank you enough, senator.
wildflower has a special meaning for the two of us.
she'll know it came from me.
it might take a while but if carla heard that phrase she will call.
good.
could be a long day.
senator, it's another call.
this one gave her name as carla.
Carla? - Nikita?
is it...
Yeah, it's me.
how are you?
I need to see you. Can I see you, Carla?
Yeah.
it's important.
you name the time and the place.
okay, I'll come to you.
Yeah, I know where that is.
down by the tracks. I'll see you there in an hour. - Okay.
Baltimore.
security can take you up the same way you came in.
we'll show ourselves out.
there's no telling who might be following us.
senator.
Baltimore.
can't tail them, don't know how they got in.
but I heard half the conversation.
we should be able to get close.
Baltimore, Maryland
I'm right here.
you're all right. You're all right.
listen, you're in a safe place.
let me see your arms. Let me see your arm.
you're all right. You're all right.
it's okay. Just relax, just relax.
just breathe, just breathe, just breathe.
hey there, wildflower.
you look so good.
I never thought i'd hear from you again.
through a senator no less.
Hey, Carla, my name is Michael.
is there a place where we can all talk?
you said you live around here?
Yeah, I...
I live right over here.
that's odd.
what is it? - I'm not sure.
well, what is it?
senator Pierce.
active SYNTAC
wildflowers survive in the desert because they save their strength.
a phrase she used in a speech tripped one of amanda's alerts.
official Santion Carla Bennett
Amanda's?
on her personal task list.
it brought up a file on a convicted criminal named Carla Bennett.
wait, wait - This is a standing kill order.
Yeah, first on the list. Even above percy.
Amanda wants this woman very dead.
after that
I had to go to mexico.
I worked my way back to the states a few years later, but it's been tough keeping my head above water and it's even tougher these days.
Carla, I had no idea.
I had no idea about you.
it's a good thing you're friends with a senator.
I only get three channels on this.
the gates house is covered on all three.
we should go.
Yeah, Carla, it's cold out here.
our car's over there. Let's go.
what about my car? I mean I can't leave it here. Some people will take my stuff.
I have enough money for you to start over.
just come with us.
how are you doing so well?
we gotta move.
how are you not in prison? - I was.
you got out after seven years for killing a cop?
not exactly.
what, you broke out? The senator helped you?
I was on death row, Carla.
what?
how are you standing here? Was your case thrown out?
it's complicated.
I gotta take this.
Yeah.
Hi, do you remember when you told me about that woman who helped get you clean, Carla Bennett?
I do.
there's a standing kill order out on her.
listen up.
Carla Bennett is priority target number one.
Nikita she's on Amanda's personal task list.
above Percy, above you.
why would division want to kill her?
I gotta go.
you're division?
what? - Don't lie to me.
what the hell is division? - Government program.
kill for them or you die. It's how I got off death row.
I've been running from them for four years.
I'm still running, and I thought that they were using you to get to me.
Oh, Michael. She's on the top of Amanda's kill list.
Amanda?
what happened to Percy?
so you are division.
it wasn't called that when I was there.
Nikita, I had no idea.
come on.
it's Percy!
they're gonna try and flank us!
we gotta leapfrog back!
what about Carla?
they're not gonna hurt you again!
get down! - Not 'cause of me.
well, been a long time.
you wanted to talk to me?
very much so. - Then drive.
and leave her the hell out of this mess.
she was real. She was, I knew her.
how?
Nikita, I haven't heard the name carla bennett before you told me.
and I've worked at division for ten years.
it's too big of a coincidence, Michael.
the one person I know who's farthest from division?
it can't be a coincidence, there has to be an answer.
did she select me?
she set me up?
we didn't operate that way.
the selection process for recruiting starts with the bureau of prisons.
Yes, but if you know what division's looking for, you can put something in their path.
I did it with Alex.
maybe division was after Carla.
you said she was on the run when you knew her.
maybe she was running away from... Them.
Yes, but why would they find me and not...
the gun.
what gun? - That night.
it's all about that night.
detective edmonds was shaking her down for running an unlicensed halfway house.
I had just lost the job and gotten high again.
I can collect that, if you wish.
and we can avoid all that paperwork down at city hall.
Carla, don't listen to him.
Nikita? - Wait your turn, honey.
Eric, check her pockets, see if she's holding.
I'm sorry.
don't touch me!
and sammy got defensive. - I said, stand back!
let's just be calm. Come on, come on.
let me just talk to her.
Nikita, what did you take? What are you on?
I said stand back. - Shut up, you pig!
can we get back to business, please? - Back!
you punk ass, bitch ass piglet!
I'm not gonna tell you again.
would you calm your partner down?
my guy's doing his job, all right?
no, he's not! - Nikita.
Nikita, come here. - Nikita, don't.
Sammy, he's not gonna do anything.
don't touch her.
Oh, that's it. You're going down.
that's when everything went sideways.
let me guess.
detective edmonds wanted to cover it up.
Oh my god. I thoght it was Eric. I thought...
he pulled a gun.
you hear me?
he pulled a gun, you shot him in self-defense.
no.
right? - No.
look, you do not want to play with me.
that's a good kid right there. A family man!- And he shot
you can find another tweaker to tweak in your next town!
he's a good man! Nikita! Nikita!
I am not in this. - You are in this.
and you don't have a choice!
get out of the way.
get out of the way! - Stop!
no, no.
come on, come on.
she put her hand on the gun.
to stop me from killing edmonds.
and it only takes one fingerprint to hit the grid.
that's how she got back on division's radar.
and how you got on their radar in the first place.
but it doesn't explain why percy wanted her alive.
wait, what?
what do you mean?
this wasn't a trap.
he didn't use Carla to find you.
he used you to find Carla.
but why?
Roan, what happened to your face?
you met her.
good lord, look at you.
look at you.
the captain of an empty ship.
well, it's temporary.
just tell me what you want, Percy.
to apologize, for starters.
for sending an agent to my house to kill me 12 years ago?
I didn't do that.
no, no, Amanda did.
but you must have known about it.
what I know is what she told me.
that you were gonna expose the program.
that is not the truth.
then why did you run?
why didn't you come to me?
could I have?
I'm not gonna do this.
this is pointless.
we are paying the price for the things that we did.
then let's make it right.
we both know she's always had it out for you.
what I don't understand is why Amanda's so afraid of you.
she's afraid of me?
I don't know.
she must be holding a grudge.
come on, you've been off the grid, and even that wasn't good enough for her.
the day after she put me in the cell, she reinstated your kill order.
it was the next day, right?
that's a long way to go for a grudge.
a 911 call wasn't any help in identifying the shooter.
could you tell us your name, sir?
I'd like to remain anonymous.
I don't understand.
why would percy be involved with a newark policeman?
he's digging up Nikita's past.
and that's connected to this carla bennett person. Who is she?
find Percy.
I want all assets, all surveillance focused on newark and the surrounding area. Now.
if carla was on the run from division when I met her, she was already their enemy.
there's no way she would have put me in there.
that's why she walked to Percy.
she was taking the hit for you, she was trying to make things right.
Yeah, but she didn't take the hit, she just got in the car.
Michael, I need answers. I mean, I need them.
I know, I know. And we're gonna get them.
how? - Find Percy.
how?
I don't know.
I just want to put a bullet in him.
well, now you can.
his dead man switch is useless.
his dead man switch.
it's like a pacemaker, right?
it's designed to send out a signal?
Yeah.
is there a way we can hone in on that signal?
Nikita. - Use it like a tracker implant.
lead us straight to him.
we already thought of that.
Birkhoff and I. It won't work.
why not? It's just reverse ping.
Yes, the signal can only be reverse-pinged through division satellite nodes.
so we'd have to be inside division?
inside operations.
what's happening? - Oh, you know.
mind blowing tragedy. Just another tuesday.
what? - Never mind.
I need your help. - Did you find Carla?
no, you're gonna find her for us.
by finding percy. - What?
you need to do it from inside operations, using division satellites.
how am I gonna keep it from Amanda?
you're not.
so once I have the right frequency I just reverse-ping it?
that's it.
this is very impressive, Alex.
how did you come up with it?
you know all that time percy made me spend with him in his cell?
while he was rattling on I was dreaming up ways to shut him up.
I wanted to use the trigger to short circuit his heart but I knew that wouldn't work so I thought up this.
are we sure he even has a heart?
I'm getting a signal.
industrial sector, corner of rayford and commerce.
rayford and commerce.
Yes, on the northeast corner.
send in the strike team immediately
how long was Nikita in the program?
I wanna know what happened to her.
later. - Now.
you first.
what about Amanda?
come on.
don't you want your life back?
I don't know.
you have changed.
no, I mean I don't know why Amanda tried having me killed.
well, she's a woman with secrets.
you must have discovered something.
I know one day something changed, but...
I don't know what triggered it.
think.
I don't know what.
why would I lie?
I scored some plans from the hall of records.
there's a foreman's office in the middle of the factory floor.
if I had carla that's where I'd keep her.
you hear the way she asked about him?
like they were old friends.
well, we're here to get answers, not jump to conclusions.
careful what you wish for.
if there's one thing I know...
the truth can set you free.
or put you in a whole new prison.
looks like percy's car.
Nikita, I know you have a lot of questions but don't forget.
Carla did save you.
and if it wasn't for her...
you and I would never have met.
there they are.
those aren't grab teams, Michael.
Yeah, I know.
we got this.
sir, me countermeasures just logged what looked like a division satellite node snooping around.
they appear to have pinged a device in this room.
all this stuff is dead.
my computer's secure.
she's clean.
might have been a reverse-ping, sir.
then it's not a device, it's me.
took care of the car?
Yes, sir. - All right, then move out.
team one, disable the evac car.
no way they're getting out of here.
that was quick.
sir, do you copy?
go ahead. - It's division.
the main circuit's been cut.
teams must already be inside.
what are you doing? - Saving your life.
get down.
okay, go!
let her go!
you won't do it.
no, you're right.
No!
this is Amanda.
don't bother tracking the dead man switch.
we're jamming it now.
Congratulations.
not the first time I've shut you out?
what do you want, Percy?
to share.
as you may know, I ran into an old friend of ours today who is still very pissed off at you.
some people just don't know when to let go.
you're pulling my leg, right?
you can talk all you want, Percy, but the fact is I'm here and you're out there.
division is mine and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Yeah, well maybe Nikita can.
she's with her now.
nighty night.
tell me again, Alex.
tell me again why you're doing this.
to save my mother.
do you love her?
of course.
I don't really know her, and that's something that I wanna change.
this is not just a mission for you.
confronting a ghost from your past is never easy.
you have to be willing to do whatever it takes.
you speak from experience?
remember, you won't be alone.
and I don't just mean division.
I'll be with you.
no matter what comes.
good to know.
I told you you'd save somebody else someday.
Nikita, I know you have a lot of questions.
I have spent so much time on the run.
just lost in my own head.
and then to see you.
when you told me that you were in division, I couldn't believe it.
I thought it was a trick.
and then I couldn't accept the coincidence.
but then I remembered there are no coincidences.
I don't care...
about your philosophy, Carla.
I want the truth.
the truth is...
this is a nightmare for me.
you being involved in this and me being the cause.
how could I have ever wanted this for you, Nikita?
all I ever wanted to do was to help you.
but what's so crazy is that you didn't just survive in the desert, you thrived.
I mean, when I last saw you you couldn't even hold down a job.
stop.
Nikita, just listen to me.
what I'm trying to tell you is that everything that has happened to you is a gift.
no, more than that.
I believe it's destiny.
our destiny.
all right, that's enough.
I don't believe a word you're saying.
I was at division for ten years.
I never heard of you.
when nikita escaped, Percy and amanda said she was the first to ever escape.
and that's true.
because I wasn't in the program.
I created it.
seven years ago, I was taken off death row and trained to be an assassin by a secret unit of the government called "Division."
it was run by Percy, who, after a failed power move, was replaced by Amanda, his second-in-command.
Carla Bennett is priority target number one.
Carla Bennett got me clean.
she was the only good thing I had in my life till division made me who I am.
this is a standing kill order.
first on the list, even above Percy.
Amanda wants this woman very dead.
so you are Division. - It wasn't called that when I was there.
when Nikita escaped, Percy and Amanda said she was the first to ever escape.
and that's true because I wasn't in the program.
I created it.
it's part of an old missile silo.
it's secure, out of view, underground. - It's huge.
in just one year, our little program has outgrown our old facility.
I don't know, this is a lot bigger than anything we ever discussed.
it's time to think big.
this is where our future begins, Carla.
you know, in those first days at Division, they were ripping out the person I used to be...
I only survived because of my memories of you.
and now... All of my memories are a lie.
when I met you, you were a confused kid, and we were both on the run.
do you really think I should've told you the truth about what I was running from?
it's harder to hear now. - Why?
at least now you can believe me.
how could you create something so evil, Carla?
don't say that. It's not evil.
I was saving lives - lives that the system was going to throw away.
only to put them back into another system that turned them into killers.
that was Amanda. She is evil.
she took my idea of transformation and giving second chances, and she corrupted it.
without her, it can be saved.
everything can be saved.
why are you so focused on Amanda?
because she tried to have me killed.
Where's your entourage?
securing the Stafford arms for the press conference.
we don't have much time. - I know.
Carla Bennett?
don't worry about her. We'll find her.
it's over. - No.
Carla Bennett is with Nikita, which means it won't be long before Nikita learns your secret, and we know what happens then.
Ari. - I doubt that Semak will even bother to send an agent.
he'll just come put the bullet in my head himself.
Ari, there's a way out of this.
Yes, there is...
but it requires a sacrifice you will not want to make.
Alex.
what do you think?
too downscale for the heir to a multibillion-dollar fortune?
who's been missing seven years and just clawed her way out of a human trafficking ring, remember?
right.
Where's Amanda? - Out.
I'm glad. She's been running us ragged with this Carla Bennett search.
what's the deal? - Need to know.
we're all shut out.
let's go over the conops again.
zetrov has closed a deal to buy the New York corsairs.
the hockey team. - It's a major international purchase for them.
sergel Semak himself is going to make the announcement.
and the whole world will be watching.
perfect time for Alexandra Udinov to make her return.
what's the security like? - Heavy.
they've rented out the entire hotel for the press conference.
only accredited media allowed entry.
Ari Tasarov will be running point for Gogol after their last security chief was let go.
God, I hate that guy.
look, lady, we've been trying to crack Amanda for a while.
she doesn't have any weak points except for you. Come on, think.
what do you have on Amanda?
I told you, I don't know.
she just - She hated me from the start.
well, that might explain why she tried to off you the first time but not why she's devoted to taking you down now.
she's afraid of you or something that you might know about her.
that's what Percy seems to think.
and we all know he'd never lie.
Percy wants to take Amanda down just as much as you do.
I mean, you do wanna take her down, right?
I want to take down Division, and Percy wants it back. There's a difference.
incoming. Encrypted line.
it's Alex.
Alex? - Operation Alexandra is a go.
good. You ready? - Guess so.
it's weird, I feel like I'm about to tell everyone I'm iron man or something.
well, yeah, you've been in hiding a long time.
it's gonna feel weird, stepping into the light.
just remember, I got your back.
always.
thank you. - Now tell me about your approach.
Nikita has someone on the inside?
it's a long story.
Nikita saved her, turned her life around.
guess it's not that long.
if this Alex is on the inside, I mean, why don't you use her to get to Amanda?
it's too dangerous. Even if she survived the attempt, she would never escape alive.
well, maybe she could poke around and get Amanda to tell her the secret.
I doubt Amanda would just tell anyone.
they're right. We're gonna find this thing that Amanda's afraid of.
it's gonna be through you.
so... Start from the beginning. Tell us everything we don't know.
we've got time.
we are out of time.
Semak must be dealt with before he learns the truth.
and the only way you can think to accomplish that is for Alex to die.
we could kill Semak.
and then we would be left with nothing.
no, this the only way.
we were going to rule an empire.
now what will we have?
Gogol's operating budget is $300 million.
after we frame Semak for Alex's death, there will be a period of chaos within Zetrov.
I can siphon the account without anyone noticing and we're away, free and clear, together.
what's wrong?
she's come so far only to suffer the same fate she escaped seven years ago.
it's not ideal, but it is either her or me.
Carla Bennett?
who are you?
relax. I'm not going to arrest you. I'm a fan.
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just a prison counselor.
faking inmate deaths, colluding with the warden to transfer them to different prisons.
I'm saving lives.
want to do it legally?
I don't know if you realize this, but you have discovered a method of creating deniable assets.
invisible men and women - A valuable commodity in our world.
you work for the government?
and so can you. Think about it.
instead of breaking the law, you could get federal funding for your project.
as opposed to doing yard work or whatever, your people could be serving their country.
you mean like soldiers?
I mean like heroes.
in the beginning, it was just Percy and me.
and we started out of a back office in d. c.
and after some early successes, he wanted to expand, get a bigger sponsor, and he found one.
oversight.
it was codename for the group.
it was illegal.
I didn't know that.
I just identified the candidates for renewal.
when did Amanda get involved?
like I said, Percy wanted to expand.
this is a lot bigger than anything we ever discussed.
it's time to think big.
this is where our future begins, Carla.
and if you're concerned about the increased workload...
I've already taken that into account.
Carla, this is Amanda, a rising star in psy-ops.
Percy's told me of your work. Very impressive, for a layman.
Amanda's already got some ideas about how to set up our home here.
all active operations will be run up here with a lower level dedicated to recruit training and living space.
no. Recruits will not be segregated.
they need to see agents coming and going, heading into the real world.
they need to see what they can become.
this isn't a summer camp. - It's also not a prison.
they need hope, or they'll die.
even a "layman" can tell you that.
this is good. Nothing worthwhile comes without friction.
we're gonna make a great team.
we were at each other's throats from that day on.
but still I was surprised when she sent someone to kill me.
I didn't think she would take it that far.
but she made one mistake.
she sent Brian to do the deed.
Brian? - One of my firsts.
Brian told me that Amanda had doctored evidence, made it look like I was going to go to congress, blow the whistle on Percy, expose the program.
it's why he approved the hit.
but Brian was one of mine.
and he said that he would go back and tell everyone that I was dead.
he gave me time to run.
so Amanda thought you were gone?
she must have been shocked when your print came up on my gun.
wait a minute.
Yeah, yeah. I remember this.
she came, uh, storming into ops freaking out about a, uh, print match, wanted me to double-, triple-check it, make sure the cops hadn't screwed up the chain of evidence.
she was looking for confirmation that you were truly alive.
and because of the time we spent together, you were the only one that could tell her for sure.
do you remember what Amanda was like when you first met her?
do you remember what she asked you about?
I don't think about those days.
if you're serious about trying to figure out what she was afraid of, you're going to have to.
ma'am, can you open your bag, please?
make sure you have the Zetrov graphics ready to go, the one with the market cap figures.
can I help you? - How would you like to win a Pulitzer?
she's made contact. - Copy that.
Alex has completed phase one.
good. Make sure all mobile units continue providing backup.
is there any progress on tracking Carla?
no, search grids still come up empty.
the level of incompetence around here can be breathtaking.
perhaps we need some cancellations to properly motivate all of you.
unshakable and in control.
that was my first impression of Amanda.
she brought me into her office, and she just focused on me.
make yourself comfortable, Nikita, have a seat.
or not.
what are you, a concierge?
if need be.
I can also be an advisor, a teacher, but most of all, a friend.
I don't need friends.
no, of course not.
you survived all those years on your own. No one ever helped you.
that's right.
not even Carla?
I read your file.
and it seems this woman meant a great deal to you, which is why I'd like to know more about her.
so I can get to know you.
it will help us decide whether or not to keep you in the program.
I haven't seen her since the night I was arrested.
she never visited you in prison?
she couldn't. - Oh, I see.
she's on the run just like you?
she used to always say that it was fate that we were both running for five years, or we would've never met.
five years.
that's enough for today, Nikita. We'll pick this up again tomorrow.
she changed my protocol completely.
that session was about building trust, not threats.
she left a new recruit alone in her office? What fire was she going to?
interrogation.
she went to interrogation.
why did you let Carla go?
all I'm asking for is the truth, Brian.
the truth will set you free.
Carla gave me my life. That's the truth.
Amanda. I think we're done here, aren't we?
he lied to us about his target.
so she's alive after all, huh?
what target? - Before your time.
what is he doing here?
I'm showing him the ropes.
michael has proven to be a top-notch operative, so I'm putting him in charge of agent operations.
do you have a sidearm?
Yeah. - Give it to me.
she needs to die.
we need to kill her.
no arguments there.
Carla. - Don't you see?
this is the reason why you found me. This is the reason why we're together again.
all those years I spent on the run,
I knew that someday it would come full circle and that Amanda would get what she deserves.
okay.
yo, showtime.
the deal is not just about the purchase of the hockey team.
it represents an important step in the globalization of Zetrov.
Mr. Semak, you've often spoken of your role at Zetrov as being the caretaker of Nikolal Udinov's vision.
do you think he'd approve of this deal?
Yes, I do.
I think about my dear friend Nikolal every day, and I've dedicated all I have done to the memory of him and his family.
and what would you say to the Udinovs if they were here today?
excuse me?
what would you say to the Udinovs?
um, well, I would say, uh...
I hope they can see everything that I have done for Zetrov.
I have.
and can you tell us who you are?
I am Alexandra Udinov, daughter of Nikolal and Katya Udinov.
it's been a long time, uncle Sergel.
now, that is one nutty press conference.
Birkhoff, tap into surveillance.
make sure Alex doesn't have any surprises.
usual cast of supporting characters.
Gogol thugs in trench coats, Gogol thugs in suits, Lord Voldemort.
Wait-Wait a second. Just g-go back.
I know that guy.
Ari Tasarov?
what do you think you're doing? - You're about to find out.
that was the darkest period of my life.
the attack on my home cost me my parents.
the time in those brothels cost me my soul.
six months ago, I got out. I got clean.
and now I feel like I'm ready to come back to my family, at least to the family that I have left.
what does this mean for control of Zetrov? Will Ms. Udinov take over?
well, no one wants to believe in what happened here today more than I, but, uh, what's important - Uh, that we take time to understand these developments.
Alex, where will you go from here?
I don't know. I'm sort of living on the road.
well, in this case, she can stay here in the hotel in the finest suite, to be paid for by Zetrov, of course.
that will be all for today, but we'll have another follow-up press conference tomorrow.
thank you.
hold on. - I'm going to make this easy.
I could press my claim for the company, drag you through a long, messy, public battle, or I could disappear, drop out of your life forever.
all I want is an offshore account funded by a 10% share in the Udinov family trust.
10%? Do you know how much that is?
and my mother.
you will give me my mother, you son of a bitch.
you have until tomorrow morning to decide.
and thanks for the suite.
Ari Tasarov, director of intelligence for Gogol, and, as of a few months ago, head of security.
started his career off in the KGB working in the first chief directorate.
then a stint in s.v.r. before joining Gogol.
this ring any bells?
you don't understand.
I wasn't in operations.
I only worked with recruits.
but he wasn't Russian.
nice to meet you again.
he was American.
maybe southern.
so he was undercover.
where did you meet him, here or somewhere overseas?
it was somewhere local.
somewhere public.
like a restaurant?
a hotel?
city SQUARE HOTEL 1999
what are you doing here?
I'm meeting a friend for dinner.
I'm sorry.
Carla, this is Bill Clay of the department of defense.
procurement department.
nice to meet you, ma'am.
well, we should get going.
I didn't make much of it,'cause back then Amanda would meet with a lot of government types.
Amanda and Ari?
could Ari be a Division asset?
Percy sent me to kill him a few years ago, so no.
maybe Amanda's a Russian mole.
cross-reference Amanda's travel patterns for the past ten years with known sightings of Ari, please.
how the hell did this happen?
we're looking into it.
we didn't anticipate that.
Udinov would take such a direct approach.
just kill her. Kill her now.
sir, we need to be careful.
like it or not, all the eyes of the world are on us now, not to mention that we're on American soil.
she will ruin everything.
which is why I have sent a man to her room with orders to stage an overdose.
to the world, this will look as though young Alexandra was overwhelmed by all the attention and suffered a tragic relapse.
just make sure it looks like an accident, for Katya's sake.
no crosses between Ari and Amanda.
if they've been meeting, they've kept it on the down low.
I also charted recent Gogol activity, looking for anything weird - Nada.
last time we ran into Gogol was - The Gates house.
the attack on oversight.
we'd assumed they'd tracked a guardian to that location, but what if they didn't?
how else would they have found it?
the only ones who knew were us and - Amanda.
she's been working with the Russians?
that's why she wanted you dead.
you were the only one who could connect the two, identify the partnership, even if you didn't know it.
I gotta warn Alex.
I'm in.
And?
she's in the shower.
wait until she's out before you subdue her. Do you have the weapon?
500 milligrams uncut.
six minutes to cardiac arrest, three more to brain death.
I'll be clear in nine minutes.
radio silence until it's done.
we'll have confirmation in nine minutes.
while we wait, I'm going to check on tomorrow's press conference.
given the number of media requests, we're going to need a larger venue.
I've got the recording.
do you know how you want to leak the video?
I have a few options.
not as many as you think.
you've got this all wrong.
Really?
I'm trying to help you.
by killing me.
no, I'm on your side.
I can prove it.
Alex, this is Amanda.
Ari is telling the truth.
we've been - We're working together.
we have been for a while.
all this tells me is that everything you said about protecting me has been a lie.
no, no. I've been trying to help you.
by collaborating with a man who's trying to kill me.
Ari has been working behind the scenes to protect you.
I wasn't able to say anything because I couldn't compromise his safety.
his safety.
from what I understand, you know all about the dangers of living as a mole.
Alex, you have to believe us.
what do you think?
what do I - Shh!
I don't trust him.
ask him: why didn't he stop the guy they sent to your room?
why didn't you stop the guy sent to my room?
Semak has been watching my every move.
that's why I came here - To send a - a warning to you through Amanda.
I'm facing knives at every turn.
must be tough.
Alex, I hate Semak just as much as you do, and I've been working for a long time to bring him down.
but I've had to move very carefully.
Amanda and I both have had to move very carefully.
believe me, we all want the same thing.
just kill her.
kill her now.
an end to Sergel Semak.
it's been 14 minutes since the last check-in.
go to the room and see what happened.
and where is Tasarov?
he says the plan was to release the video as evidence against Semak.
Alex, that plan only works if you're dead.
tell her I'm on my way.
Mr. Tassrov, come in.
this is command.
Yes.
a unit has been dispathced to be the girl's room.
and Mr. Semak would like to see you.
understood.
we haven't much time.
as soon as they discover that the hit has failed, the backup plan goes into effect.
backup plan?
there are men all throughout the hotel.
they have orders to shoot to kill.
won't that be a little bit hard to cover up for the media?
Semak will just come up with a story.
you were mugged, or a crazed fan broke in.
all he wants is to see you dead.
he'll clean up the mess later.
listen, if you don't believe me.
all units check in.
main entrance standing by ......
south corner standing by ......
elevator banks standing by ......
the only way you leave here alive is to let me guide you out.
Michael's on his way to you.
he won't make it in time.
looks like I'm going to have to trust this bastard.
trust won't be necessary.
put him on the phone with me.
Yes.
you're not the only one who can make a recording, Ari.
playback
I hate Semak just as much as you do, and I've been working for a long time to bring him down.
I hit one button, this thing goes live over the hotel's P. A. System.
everyone in the building will hear it, including Semak.
you got that?
Alex dies - I die, yes, I understand.
keep this channel open.
it will let you hear everything going on in the command suite.
where am I headed?
the sub-basement.
all the ground-floor exits will be covered.
your best bet is the service driveway - Two guards, both outside, and avoid the elevators.
I wish you luck.
you better.
hold on, hold on, you are not gonna make a deal with him.
not now, Carla.
he is Amanda's partner.
Alex, can you hear me?
you've been through worse, okay?
yeah? Refresh my memory.
this ready to go?
just hit send.
you hear that?
we got a gun to Ari's head.
he goes down, Amanda goes down too.
without his bankroll, Amanda will lose Division.
it is in their interest for you to survive.
exit
it's about damn time.
your man is dead, and Alexandra is gone.
tell all units we're moving to plan B.
make sure the ground floor is covered.
she'll probably head there.
and can you scrabble the hotel security cameras?
I want to make sure Gogol can't see Alex.
done.
I routed the real feeds here.
guest rooms there, service area there.
and I'll send the exterior to the tablet.
Where'd you put it?
Carla, what are you doing?
something I should have done a long time ago.
I'm gonna destroy Amanda.
wait. Wait.
lady, put that down now.
what about the stairs and elevators?
units three and four, head to the stairwells.
start at the ground floor and make your way up.
cut all power to the elevators.
is that what you want, Nikita?
you want to kill me to save Amanda?
Birkhoff, just put the gun down.
I can handle her. Carla
I hate to tell you this, but your friend is cuckoo for a certain cereal.
Birkhoff, just put it down and disable the tablet, please.
I can't do that.
the audio file's already been uploaded to the hotel system.
you see?
it's our only chance while he's in that hotel.
if you do this, Alex loses her support.
she could die.
Oh, come on.
you've already blinded the cameras.
Michael's on his way to help, and from what I can see, she is more than capable of handling herself.
wait.
just wait.
wait till I find out that she's okay.
we can't wait.
with Amanda, you will never know when you're gonna get another shot.
she always finds a way out.
we have to take her down now.
which bring us back to put my hardware down, bitch.
tap into the hotel's cameras, track any open radio frequencies, and get me the agents on site.
I'll have it on the board right away.
no, feed it to my office.
but how will we - In my office.
are we clear?
Yes, ma'am.
units three and four, check in.
heading to the laundry room.
compliments of Amanda.
she's clear.
good.
keep them off her tail.
copy.
the service entrance is just up there.
I'll cover you.
Carla, you have my word.
we will get Amanda - We can't wait.
we will get Amanda.
you said so yourself, she's lost her funding.
if she hooks up with the Russians, there will be no way for me to save the program.
save the program?
we get rid of Amanda, and we can restore it to what it once was.
I told you it can be saved.
we are so... Far past that.
there is no saving division.
Yes, there is.
we kill Amanda, and there is.
she pushes that button, and Alex is out in the cold.
and we don't do that.
we don't leave our friends to be Amanda's victims.
that's right.
I am promising you... We will get her.
just let me make sure that Alex is safe.
you've waited years.
give me one day.
one.
please.
unit six, check out service entrance "B."
this way.
service entrance "B" is secure. Move to A.
but she's heading outside.
lock the exits.
don NOT ENTER WARONG WAY
division.
get in.
I know you all have been waiting.
uh, my apologies.
I'd like to begin by, - Where is Alexandra Udinov?
the truth is, we don't know.
we were not able to locate her this morning.
clearly, this was an individual who had been through a lot, and, - it seems she decided not to subject herself anymore - Look, there she is.
thank you, uncle Sergel, not only for your hospitality but for all of the years of hard work.
you've taken care of Zetrov as if it were your own.
but it's time for me to step up.
I would've preferred to have done this with my father and mother by my side.
but Nikolal Udinov founded Zetrov, and I'm here to tell you...
an Udinov will run Zetrov once again.
ALEXANDIRA UDINOW NEWS CONFERENCE
Yes.
I thought she didn't want the company.
she doesn't.
so what the hell is she doing?
she's declaring war.
no, I haven't spoken with her yet.
she's doing this on her own.
in which case, this has worked out far better than we'd hoped.
brings us back to our original plan.
if Alex is truly serious about challenging Semak for control of the company, we're going to have to be even more careful now that she and Nikita know about us.
Yes, but now we're aligned against a common enemy, Semak.
though I see your point.
you never know what Nikita is going to do.
look, about yesterday, I, - You did what you had to do for your friend.
and I made you a promise.
but, Carla, I can't expose Ari and Amanda's relationship.
not yet.
I know.
you do?
I told you, Amanda always finds a way out.
she didn't.
with your girl pressing deeper into the lion's den, she's gonna need Ari and Amanda to protect her.
she's angry right now, so she's not gonna want to back down.
I know how she feels.
you've been away a long time.
you don't know what Division has become.
I know what I set out to do, and I know it can be that way again.
I also know I was wrong.
I let my hatred for Amanda get the better of me.
you were right, wildflower.
I've got a lot to learn from you.
it's me.
I have to say, I'm surprised you called.
makes two of us.
I need your help.
what about Nikita?
let me be clear about this, Percy.
we're going to reboot the program and put it on the right course.
we're making heroes, right?
Absolutely.
we'll be partners again just like we used to be.
but this time you're gonna know better than to listen to someone like Amanda because we are defined by the company we keep... Like Amanda and Ari.
Tasarov?
they're working together.
course.
but not that Nikita will use that information to help us.
she says that other priorities are more important.
nothing is more important than Division.
that's why I'm coming to you - Because you're the only one who understands that.
division must be saved.
continue due West.
you're within 30 meters of the tracker.
it hasn't moved.
on the other side of the concrete barrier.
advise when you have eyes on him.
it's Paul.
we have confirmation.
go for extract. Alert medical.
we're gonna get you out of here, okay?
ma'am, I'm tracking local police on approach.
they're responding to an anonymous 911 call reporting a body at that location.
sniper!
pull back. Return to base.
what about Paul? - Leave the body.
they can't I. D. him.
that's our fourth agent down in three days.
it's Nikita. She's stepping up her fight, taking us out directly.
it's not Nikita.
how do you know?
just make sure Mason's team makes it back here.
send a support unit to meet them.
we'll find who's behind these deaths.
in the meantime, we will not let it deter us from our course.
send me a status update on our Zetrov operation.
what the hell was that?
she doesn't care that we're being targeted?
Amanda's dealing with a lot right now.
Really? 'Cause the only thing I see her dealing with lately is her precious Alexandra Udinov.
moscow
I don't care what Amanda wants.
let her and Ari think that I'm ready to take over Zetrov.
that's never gonna happen.
all I want to do is get my mother back.
I want that too, Alex, but, as long as you're there,
I can't make a move against Amanda or Ari.
and I really, really want to.
two more days. That's all I need.
I promise. - For what?
I'm going home again.
this time, with the media.
as long as there's a camera nearby, emak won't risk an attack.
how do you know that your mother will leave with you?
I don't.
but I have to try to convince her, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, you do.
two more days.
she's as stubborn as you are.
worse.
I just wish that you could see the big picture.
what happens if Amanda uses Alex to overthrow Semak and gains control of the company?
Alex doesn't want the company.
I believe you.
that's why Amanda is gonna betray her.
work it so Ari can take the throne, at which point she gets billions of Russian dollars and no one to stop her.
it's never gonna happen. - It's happening now.
look, sometimes you have to put what's right ahead of your personal feelings for the greater good.
my personal feelings are right.
first, you protect the people you love.
then, you talk about the greater good.
I guess I was wrong.
you're definitely more stubborn.
Birkhoff found something.
we need to talk to you.
and it's sensitive information.
Michael, Carla's on our side. It's okay.
you know what, that's okay.
I actually want to get more air.
what's up?
there be some serious rumblings in the shadow world this week.
three related homicides, all in the tri-state area.
in each case, the victim was grabbed at home, bodies dumped in random locations.
you found a serial killer?
with a taste for victims who work for a certain black ops group.
Amanda is stepping up her plans.
you've got to take Division away from her now.
what's the situation with Nikita?
she just doesn't get it. It's really frustrating.
well, I've got a solve for that.
give me your location.
I'll send roan and Patrick over to pay her a visit.
no, I told you she's off-limits.
now what are you doing about Amanda?
am I answering to you now?
look, let's just sit tight, let this hand play itself out.
Amanda's obsession with Alex is gonna help us get Division back.
trust me.
found a new one.
that's Paul.
someone's declared open season on Division, and they're killing agents at random?
it's a good day to be rogue.
no, I don't think that it's random.
remember a few years back when Percy got all paranoid about Gogol?
Yeah, he thought Semak was building a private army.
good call on that.
I remember. He set up a Gogol taskforce.
right. Well, he assigned me to pick the agents.
these agents.
so you think Gogol's behind this?
I mean, doesn't Amanda's boyfriend run that joint?
Yeah, but their relationship is on the D. L. so maybe the orders come straight from Semak.
Ari still has to pretend to carry them out, right?
I don't know, but, based on this list, I'm pretty sure I know who the next target is.
sucks to be them.
no. Not today.
Oh, come on.
not again with the rescuing and the saving of the enemy. - We could possibly build another alliance.
come on, Division's been battered this year with us, Oversight, Amanda versus Percy.
the place is ripe for rebellion.
can we talk?
you're shooting up your getaway car.
those weren't Gogol agents.
that was a guardian.
I think I know .
we want to know what your Division is planning for Alexandra Udinov.
there's been a mistake.
I'm not who you think I am.
you are agent of Division.
I don't know what that is.
we don't believe you.
she's holding up well.
she's almost through her restraints.
shall I give Patrick the green light?
Yeah, go ahead.
she'll be back at Division within the hour.
right on schedule.
who's next on the list?
so Percy's kidnapping Division agents and framing Gogol for it?
remember when you said Division was ripe for a little rebellion?
that's exactly what Percy is hoping for.
these attacks are specifically designed to damage Amanda's leadership.
that means Percy knows about Amanda and Ari's secret.
but how?
I mean, we only figure it out because I saw Ari at Alex's press conference last week.
just because you couldn't remember doesn't mean that Percy stopped digging.
he must have found out some other way.
another agent?
Caleb. His tracker went offline an hour ago at his cover job.
he wasn't on the list you gave me.
Dina, I'm glad you're back.
let's get you debriefed. - Let's save time.
it's Gogol. They're behind this.
it makes sense.
we found tula shell casings near the bodies.
the place I escaped from is in the middle of Bratva territory, Gogol's mafia connection.
a few shell casings and a building in Brooklyn prove nothing.
Amanda, we can't sit back while they hit us.
we need to show our enemies that there are consequences for attacking Division.
I will put an end to those attacks, Mason, believe me.
I already know how to stop the attacks.
the men who took me wanted to know about Alexandra Udinov.
they want us to stop helping her.
Sean, what are you doing...
Nikita didn't tell you. I'm your new bodyguard.
and I'm starving.
you can't be here.
that is no way to talk to the man who might take a bullet for you.
you can't be here.
you're seal team six.
if you hang around me, I guarantee someone will take your picture and blow your covert status.
that's long gone.
my identity came out with the whole gates house coverage.
although I can't say I have my own hash tag like somebody I know.
what are you really doing here?
the last remaining evidence of my mother's involvement with Oversight is all recorded in one place.
the Black Box. Last time I saw that it was...
the house we're visiting today, right?
what's in the case?
I brought some gear to neutralize the box in case we run across it. Cool by you?
Sean, if you screw this up for me...
Hey, I knew the deal when I came here.
job one: Protect you. Job two: Make sure you get your mom.
so relax. Don't be scared.
why would I be scared?
cause you don't think you can convince her to come with you.
you're afraid that she won't see things your way.
she will.
when she sees all you've done to save her, she will.
I know Percy is behind this, and his game is working.
my troops think your agency is responsible.
the mood here has turned against me, and my hands are tied.
so are mine.
I can't divert Gogol resources to help you.
I'm supposed to be preparing for young Alexandra's arrival, remember?
he's going to ruin everything.
how did he find out about us?
how do you think? Carla Bennett.
they spent the better part of a day together before my Alpha team raided his rathole.
now I have no idea where he is.
and if I send one more agent out to die...
you need an outside hire.
there must be an independent contractor somewhere out there who can track Percy.
found it in my bag.
must have switched them while we were prepping.
sorry.
I didn't mean for you to see that.
forget about me for a second.
what if someone else saw it?
you never know how close your enemies are gonna be, Michael.
what, you think Division's gonna find the beach house?
Sean Pierce did.
Amanda found our last place.
if she finds out that you have a son...
you're right.
I'll be more careful.
it shouldn't exist.
are we still talking about the photograph?
I don't want anything to happen to Max.
guys, just got a ping through an x-band relay that we monitor.
Amanda wants to chat.
it has to be a trap. - Chill.
she can't trace us here, okay?
set it up.
my agents think Gogol's the threat.
they're wrong, but I can't very well explain how I know that.
well, gee, Amanda, I guess you were right.
personal relationships outside of Division really are a bad idea.
my connection to Ari is irrelevant.
Percy has to be stopped.
he's the one responsible for this bloodshed.
you're responsible.
you corrupted Division, and now you want to sell it out to the enemy.
Carla. Self-righteous as ever.
no, just plain righteous.
I don't manipulate people to further my own agenda.
manipulating subjects was the basis of your entire program, though I have made significant improvements on it since then.
thanks for thinking of us, but we'll pass.
find someone else.
I was speaking to Nikita.
Oh, I talked to her.
she said there's no way in hell she's helping you.
then maybe there's someone else you'd like to help.
can you hear me?
is that Fletcher?
no, he's gone. Nikita was there.
What'd you do, Amanda?
have your techs splice together some old recordings of Ryan's voice?
no.
listen, the first time we met, we were in that bunker in Chile.
I asked who you were, you said,"Nikita. You hung up on me.
you died. How?
surprised me too.
I mean, the part where I was alive. The dying thing, I...
I kind of saw that coming.
are you okay? She isn't...
I'm still in one piece.
Amanda's kept me alive to help her work on her special projects.
I really hope for his sake that's not a euphemism.
here's the offer.
you bring me Percy, I'll give you Ryan.
deal?
bring you Percy?
unfortunately, I need him alive to answer for his crimes.
you got a deal.
just like I remember it.
and yet the original actually burned to the ground.
how'd you feel when you heard that Sergei Semak had constructed an exact replica of your childhood home?
it was very... emotional.
but now that I'm here I can feel my family's presence.
like my mother is upstairs waiting for me right now.
maybe we should go through here.
right. My father's office.
not an exact replica.
Mr. Pierce, I thought we discussed the route of today's tour.
I'm sorry. I have a terrible memory.
if you continue down that corridor, you'll make your way to the conservatory.
thank you so much, Mr. Tasarov.
Sonya, who's working on Caleb's abduction case?
my team's on standby. - No one.
look at the monitors.
Amanda's got a special team on it.
who? What team?
you should talk to Amanda.
I've got a lot of data to sort through here.
what took you so long?
your old hard drives were a mess.
I've seen hoarders with better organizational systems.
true genius cannot be contained.
so it's official.
we're working for Amanda.
well, technically, I'm only working with Sonya here.
Nikita thought putting our two giant brains together gave us the best chance of finding Percy.
Sonya, you remember Carla?
you guys tried to have her killed last week.
I found the file. What does it do?
well, when Nikki first came back to town, this is before your time, she kidnapped a certain Division asset...
I've heard this story.
she left you duct-taped to a swing set.
actually it was a rocking horse.
whatever.
the point is, she jammed my tracker.
when I got back to Division, I started working on a back-channel system.
a way to find someone even if their signal was being jammed?
search Detail Searching for matches to footage
have you tested this?
I don't see how it will work...The hard work
it is not yours to question the genius, only to marvel at it.
all I need from you is a frequency for the missing agent.
Sonya, you can change his frequency later.
after we pull his ass out of Percy's frying pan.
if we find the agent... - We find Percy.
your call.
Amanda is using your sympathies against you.
don't let her.
I can't worry about punishing Amanda right now when I can save Ryan and get Percy off the streets at the same time.
this isn't about punishment or revenge.
it isn't.
look, in the right hands, under the right leadership,
division can save so many more lives.
Carla, Division is not a shield.
it's a sword.
and it bleeds everything it touches.
Percy Nikita's working with Amand. They're
carle They're tracking the agents you kidnapped. Get out now.
we're sure his tracker can't send out a signal?
been dead for almost an hour.
the chip is useless.
why take the chance?
get that body out of here now.
got him. Whoop, there he is.
so fast?
I'm still not really sure what just happened.
and that is why you fail.
except at hotness.
at which you succeed. - What?
you heard me.
he's in Manhattan. Downtown.
go on.
you can reach it.
it's okay. I got you a new hat.
you... you mind if I do the honors?
please.
Hey, boss.
actually, I meant...
pathetic.
Carla, look at you.
teaming up with the motley insurgents.
have they shown you the secret handshake yet?
this is not the time to be making jokes.
I can't help it. Forgive me.
okay, interrogation. I'm terrified.
what do you want to know? - Nothing really.
we just need you to speak in that microphone, confirm you're a happy, healthy hostage.
you're not curious as to my grand design?
Oh, we worked it out.
Amanda did too, by the way.
she knows you're behind these attacks.
working with Amanda.
big victory for her.
I know she was always pained by your defection.
it's a one-time deal.
I made an exception for you.
how do you feel about that?
I don't like it.
but what we're getting in return is worth it.
I'm being traded?
for what? Or whom?
I actually kind of like the kid. He's got spirit.
but worth as much as me?
Yeah, well, you can take it up with Amanda.
we about done here?
you don't actually think this trade is gonna happen, do you?
all of Amanda's favorite people in one place, and she's just gonna play by the rules?
interesting.
why don't you grab my phone and shoot roan and Patrick a text?
round up everybody for the big kill.
don't worry, Percy.
if everything goes sideways...
I'll make sure you die first.
the trade is set.
Hauppauge steel factory.
three hours.
this trade is an opportunity.
Nikita will be expecting a double cross.
let's not disappoint her.
perfect. Semak's art collection ought to keep them busy for a while.
good. I was getting bored.
I never understood that whole bedazzled egg thing.
where are we going? - Back stairs.
they lead to the wing where my mother's kept.
now those guards... - Hey, guys.
Hey, I'm guarding Alexandra.
so I'm a little bit jumpy.
and I kind of took that rude comment that you said as a threat, and I kicked your ass.
that's the one.
he took her.
Percy's right. Amanda will double-cross you.
it's what she does best.
that's why we're not bringing Percy.
what? - At least not right away.
Michael, can you hold him here?
top of this old machine shop?
Yeah, that's good.
I'll have a line of sight on the trade area.
soon as we know they've got Ryan, we bring him down.
great.
insurance.
you can never have enough against Amanda.
it's from Carla.
Percy will be at the Hauppauge steel factory, top floor of the machine shop in three hours.
Aye. Let's collect him then.
you okay?
you seem preoccupied.
no.
I'm just amazed.
at you and how you just throw yourself into harm's way, no questions asked.
someone once told me.
it only takes one person to make a difference.
Yeah.
I know we haven't really been seeing eye to eyeover this thing, you'll understand where I was coming from.
I do.
you moved my mother. Where?
no, the protection detail checked on her last night before bed.
well, then they're incompetent, and so is your florist, 'cause those flowers up there are two weeks past their sell-by date.
Semak must have moved her without telling me.
I don't believe you.
Alex, I would never have risked moving Katya, not with all the cameras pointed at your family right now.
that means Semak doesn't trust you, in which case you're no use to me.
you can't help me if he suspects you.
if he's suspicious, it's because I have been helping you.
you've survived four attempts on your life.
the timetable on Semak's death must be moved up.
what?
we need to get rid of him before he kills us both.
unless of course you think he's just going to step aside, hand you the keys to the kingdom along with your mother.
you're already planning something.
Semak's going to have a fatal accident.
at least, that's how the world will see it.
conspiracy theories will swirl of course, and the kill will be pinned on a foreign intelligence service.
which one? - Not important.
I have a mole burrowed deep within that agency waiting to be activated.
it seems now is the time.
we're done here.
the hell was that? I wasn't done with him.
you actually think he's gonna tell you where she is?
remember that gear I brought to wipe the Black Box?
I just used it to copy Ari's hard drive.
if we want answers, we'll get them ourselves.
Hauppauge
I can't believe this place is even on a map.
operation ZONE
they're here.
tell her you want to see Percy first.
Where's Ryan? - Where's Percy?
I thought Percy was supposed to be at the top floor of the machine shop.
Nikki must have changed her mind.
it ain't there.
must have hit repeat on the TiVo,'cause here we go again.
Nikki knew you were dirty the second Percy started killing agents.
you're making a mistake.
no, you made a mistake.
you think we tracked that dead agent at Percy's place?
there is no backchannel system.
we piggybacked on your text.
you gave us the location.
it was all Nikki's idea.
the student becomes the master.
worked so well we let you do it again.
now roan thinks Percy's on the top floor of that building, which is exactly where we want him to go.
because that's where Amanda's guy will be.
agent Wyatt, are you in position?
I'm set.
soon as they're all together, fire the missile.
you can't do this.
you can't let Amanda win.
didn't you hear me?
we're double-crossing her double cross.
none of you are gonna win.
you know what really pisses me off?
after all this is over, she's still gonna forgive you.
see, that's the thing about Nikki.
no matter how many times the people she loves let her down, she keeps on doing the right thing.
cause it's the only thing she knows how to do.
now turn around and put your hands on your head before I shoot you in both kneecaps.
Hey. Did you not hear me?
shoot me.
stop.
I've worked with my share of killers.
I worked on death row.
remember?
you don't have it in you.
stop.
Carla, stop!
sorry.
Birkhoff, they're on the move. Do you copy?
all right. Okay.
sorry.
okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Mason, is that you?
operations, we've got Percy.
Fletch lives.
negative contact. Targets are still alive.
they're alive. - Open fire on everyone.
Carla was wrong. Percy's not here.
they're in the factory. Let's go.
stop right there!
did you know that Amanda called Nikita and sent her after me? - Shut up.
probably has her on speed dial.
I said,"shut up.
you were ordered to kill me, weren't you?
you're probably wondering, like I am, where Amanda's getting her orders from these days.
as soon as I get back, I guarantee you, there will be no doubt about authority.
and you will be rewarded.
smart kid.
he has a future.
wait, wait. Just wait. We called a doctor we trust, okay?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. - Carla, please don't.
we made a deal...
Percy and I.
we made a deal.
to save Division.
to make it good.
like it was supposed to be.
like I know it can be.
I know it can be.
because it made you.
it made you.
we're setting up another safe house.
you can lay low until this all blows over.
you think it's ever gonna blow over?
it has to.
I don't know what happened, Nik.
I told her to stop. She wouldn't stop.
the gun just went off.
she knew what she was doing.
you got that?
she knew.
Yeah.
all I'm seeing are details on guard rotations, nothing about my mother.
what about that file?
it's the only one that's been updated recently.
Yeah, it's a personnel record for a deep cover operative, codenamed Ohotnik.
it means hunter.
nice. Deep cover. Where?
mi-6. British intelligence.
Ari said that he had someone in a foreign agency.
someone he was gonna use to kill Semak.
so who is it?
we know her.
you were right about this.
it's too dangerous to keep around.
you never know how close your enemies are gonna be.
continue due West.
you're within 30 meters of the tracker.
it hasn't moved.
on the other side of the concrete barrier.
advise when you have eyes on him.
it's Paul.
we have confirmation.
go for extract. Alert medical.
we're gonna get you out of here, okay?
ma'am, I'm tracking local police on approach.
they're responding to an anonymous 911 call reporting a body at that location.
sniper!
pull back. Return to base.
what about Paul? - Leave the body.
they can't I. D. him.
that's our fourth agent down in three days.
it's Nikita. She's stepping up her fight, taking us out directly.
it's not Nikita.
how do you know?
just make sure Mason's team makes it back here.
send a support unit to meet them.
we'll find who's behind these deaths.
in the meantime, we will not let it deter us from our course.
send me a status update on our Zetrov operation.
what the hell was that?
she doesn't care that we're being targeted?
Amanda's dealing with a lot right now.
Really? 'Cause the only thing I see her dealing with lately is her precious Alexandra Udinov.
moscow
I don't care what Amanda wants.

that's never gonna happen.
all I want to do is get my mother back.
I want that too, Alex, but, as long as you're there,
I can't make a move against Amanda or Ari.
and I really, really want to.
two more days. That's all I need.
I promise. - For what?
I'm going home again.
this time, with the media.
as long as there's a camera nearby, emak won't risk an attack.
how do you know that your mother will leave with you?
I don't.
but I have to try to convince her, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, you do.
two more days.
she's as stubborn as you are.
worse.
I just wish that you could see the big picture.
what happens if Amanda uses Alex to overthrow Semak and gains control of the company?
Alex doesn't want the company.
I believe you.
that's why Amanda is gonna betray her.
work it so Ari can take the throne, at which point she gets billions of Russian dollars and no one to stop her.
it's never gonna happen. - It's happening now.
look, sometimes you have to put what's right ahead of your personal feelings for the greater good.
my personal feelings are right.
first, you protect the people you love.
then, you talk about the greater good.
I guess I was wrong.
you're definitely more stubborn.
Birkhoff found something.

Sean, if you screw this up for me...
Hey, I knew the deal when I came here.
job one: Protect you. Job two: Make sure you get your mom.
so relax. Don't be scared.
why would I be scared?
cause you don't think you can convince her to come with you.
you're afraid that she won't see things your way.
she will.
when she sees all you've done to save her, she will.
I know Percy is behind this, and his game is working.
my troops think your agency is responsible.
the mood here has turned against me, and my hands are tied.
so are mine.
I can't divert Gogol resources to help you.
I'm supposed to be preparing for young Alexandra's arrival, remember?
he's going to ruin everything.
how did he find out about us?
how do you think? Carla Bennett.
they spent the better part of a day together before my Alpha team raided his rathole.
now I have no idea where he is.
and if I send one more agent out to die...
you need an outside hire.
there must be an independent contractor somewhere out there who can track Percy.
found it in my bag.
must have switched them while we were prepping.
sorry.
I didn't mean for you to see that.
forget about me for a second.
what if someone else saw it?
you never know how close your enemies are gonna be, Michael.
what, you think Division's gonna find the beach house?
Sean Pierce did.
Amanda found our last place.
if she finds out that you have a son...
you're right.
I'll be more careful.
it shouldn't exist.
are we still talking about the photograph?
I don't want anything to happen to Max.
guys, just got a ping through an x-band relay that we monitor.
Amanda wants to chat.
it has to be a trap. - Chill.
she can't trace us here, okay?
set it up.
my agents think Gogol's the threat.
they're wrong, but I can't very well explain how I know that.
well, gee, Amanda, I guess you were right.
personal relationships outside of Division really are a bad idea.
my connection to Ari is irrelevant.
Percy has to be stopped.
he's the one responsible for this bloodshed.
you're responsible.
you corrupted Division, and now you want to sell it out to the enemy.
Carla. Self-righteous as ever.
no, just plain righteous.
I don't manipulate people to further my own agenda.
manipulating subjects was the basis of your entire program, though I have made significant improvements on it since then.
thanks for thinking of us, but we'll pass.
find someone else.
I was speaking to Nikita.
Oh, I talked to her.
she said there's no way in hell she's helping you.
then maybe there's someone else you'd like to help.
can you hear me?
is that Fletcher?
no, he's gone. Nikita was there.
What'd you do, Amanda?
have your techs splice together some old recordings of Ryan's voice?
no.
listen, the first time we met, we were in that bunker in Chile.
I asked who you were, you said,"Nikita. You hung up on me.
you died. How?
surprised me too.
I mean, the part where I was alive. The dying thing, I...
I kind of saw that coming.
are you okay? She isn't...
I'm still in one piece.
Amanda's kept me alive to help her work on her special projects.
I really hope for his sake that's not a euphemism.
here's the offer.
you bring me Percy, I'll give you Ryan.
deal?
bring you Percy?
unfortunately, I need him alive to answer for his crimes.
you got a deal.
just like I remember it.
and yet the original actually burned to the ground.
how'd you feel when you heard that Sergei Semak had constructed an exact replica of your childhood home?
it was very... emotional.
but now that I'm here I can feel my family's presence.
like my mother is upstairs waiting for me right now.
maybe we should go through here.
right. My father's office.
not an exact replica.
Mr. Pierce, I thought we discussed the route of today's tour.
I'm sorry. I have a terrible memory.
if you continue down that corridor, you'll make your way to the conservatory.
thank you so much, Mr. Tasarov.
Sonya, who's working on Caleb's abduction case?
my team's on standby. - No one.
look at the monitors.
Amanda's got a special team on it.
who? What team?
you should talk to Amanda.
I've got a lot of data to sort through here.
what took you so long?
your old hard drives were a mess.
I've seen hoarders with better organizational systems.
true genius cannot be contained.
so it's official.
we're working for Amanda.
well, technically, I'm only working with Sonya here.
Nikita thought putting our two giant brains together gave us the best chance of finding Percy.
Sonya, you remember Carla?
you guys tried to have her killed last week.
I found the file. What does it do?
well, when Nikki first came back to town, this is before your time, she kidnapped a certain Division asset...
I've heard this story.
she left you duct-taped to a swing set.
actually it was a rocking horse.
whatever.
the point is, she jammed my tracker.
when I got back to Division, I started working on a back-channel system.
a way to find someone even if their signal was being jammed?
search Detail Searching for matches to footage
have you tested this?
I don't see how it will work...The hard work
it is not yours to question the genius, only to marvel at it.
all I need from you is a frequency for the missing agent.
Sonya, you can change his frequency later.
after we pull his ass out of Percy's frying pan.
if we find the agent... - We find Percy.
your call.
Amanda is using your sympathies against you.
don't let her.
I can't worry about punishing Amanda right now when I can save Ryan and get Percy off the streets at the same time.
this isn't about punishment or revenge.
it isn't.
look, in the right hands, under the right leadership,
division can save so many more lives.
Carla, Division is not a shield.
it's a sword.
and it bleeds everything it touches.
Percy Nikita's working with Amand. They're
carle They're tracking the agents you kidnapped. Get out now.
we're sure his tracker can't send out a signal?
been dead for almost an hour.
the chip is useless.
why take the chance?
get that body out of here now.
got him. Whoop, there he is.
so fast?
I'm still not really sure what just happened.
and that is why you fail.
except at hotness.
at which you succeed. - What?
you heard me.
he's in Manhattan. Downtown.
go on.
you can reach it.
it's okay. I got you a new hat.
you... you mind if I do the honors?
please.
Hey, boss.
actually, I meant...
pathetic.
Carla, look at you.
teaming up with the motley insurgents.
have they shown you the secret handshake yet?
this is not the time to be making jokes.
I can't help it. Forgive me.
okay, interrogation. I'm terrified.
what do you want to know? - Nothing really.
we just need you to speak in that microphone, confirm you're a happy, healthy hostage.
you're not curious as to my grand design?
Oh, we worked it out.
Amanda did too, by the way.
she knows you're behind these attacks.
working with Amanda.
big victory for her.
I know she was always pained by your defection.
it's a one-time deal.
I made an exception for you.
how do you feel about that?
I don't like it.
but what we're getting in return is worth it.
I'm being traded?
for what? Or whom?
I actually kind of like the kid. He's got spirit.
but worth as much as me?
Yeah, well, you can take it up with Amanda.
we about done here?
you don't actually think this trade is gonna happen, do you?
all of Amanda's favorite people in one place, and she's just gonna play by the rules?
interesting.
why don't you grab my phone and shoot roan and Patrick a text?
round up everybody for the big kill.
don't worry, Percy.
if everything goes sideways...
I'll make sure you die first.
the trade is set.
Hauppauge steel factory.
three hours.
this trade is an opportunity.
Nikita will be expecting a double cross.
let's not disappoint her.
perfect. Semak's art collection ought to keep them busy for a while.
good. I was getting bored.
I never understood that whole bedazzled egg thing.
where are we going? - Back stairs.
they lead to the wing where my mother's kept.
now those guards... - Hey, guys.
Hey, I'm guarding Alexandra.
so I'm a little bit jumpy.
and I kind of took that rude comment that you said as a threat, and I kicked your ass.
that's the one.
he took her.
Percy's right. Amanda will double-cross you.
it's what she does best.
that's why we're not bringing Percy.
what? - At least not right away.
Michael, can you hold him here?
top of this old machine shop?
Yeah, that's good.
I'll have a line of sight on the trade area.
soon as we know they've got Ryan, we bring him down.
great.
insurance.
you can never have enough against Amanda.
it's from Carla.
Percy will be at the Hauppauge steel factory, top floor of the machine shop in three hours.
Aye. Let's collect him then.
you okay?
you seem preoccupied.
no.
I'm just amazed.
at you and how you just throw yourself into harm's way, no questions asked.
someone once told me.
it only takes one person to make a difference.
Yeah.
I know we haven't really been seeing eye to eyeover this thing, you'll understand where I was coming from.
I do.
you moved my mother. Where?
no, the protection detail checked on her last night before bed.
well, then they're incompetent, and so is your florist, 'cause those flowers up there are two weeks past their sell-by date.
Semak must have moved her without telling me.
I don't believe you.
Alex, I would never have risked moving Katya, not with all the cameras pointed at your family right now.
that means Semak doesn't trust you, in which case you're no use to me.
you can't help me if he suspects you.
if he's suspicious, it's because I have been helping you.
you've survived four attempts on your life.
the timetable on Semak's death must be moved up.
what?
we need to get rid of him before he kills us both.
unless of course you think he's just going to step aside, hand you the keys to the kingdom along with your mother.
you're already planning something.
Semak's going to have a fatal accident.
at least, that's how the world will see it.
conspiracy theories will swirl of course, and the kill will be pinned on a foreign intelligence service.
which one? - Not important.
I have a mole burrowed deep within that agency waiting to be activated.
it seems now is the time.
we're done here.
the hell was that? I wasn't done with him.
you actually think he's gonna tell you where she is?
remember that gear I brought to wipe the Black Box?
I just used it to copy Ari's hard drive.
if we want answers, we'll get them ourselves.
Hauppauge
I can't believe this place is even on a map.
operation ZONE
they're here.
tell her you want to see Percy first.
Where's Ryan? - Where's Percy?
I thought Percy was supposed to be at the top floor of the machine shop.
Nikki must have changed her mind.
it ain't there.
must have hit repeat on the TiVo,'cause here we go again.
Nikki knew you were dirty the second Percy started killing agents.
you're making a mistake.
no, you made a mistake.
you think we tracked that dead agent at Percy's place?
there is no backchannel system.
we piggybacked on your text.
you gave us the location.
it was all Nikki's idea.
the student becomes the master.
worked so well we let you do it again.
now roan thinks Percy's on the top floor of that building, which is exactly where we want him to go.
because that's where Amanda's guy will be.
agent Wyatt, are you in position?
I'm set.
soon as they're all together, fire the missile.
you can't do this.
you can't let Amanda win.
didn't you hear me?
we're double-crossing her double cross.
none of you are gonna win.
you know what really pisses me off?
after all this is over, she's still gonna forgive you.
see, that's the thing about Nikki.
no matter how many times the people she loves let her down, she keeps on doing the right thing.
cause it's the only thing she knows how to do.
now turn around and put your hands on your head before I shoot you in both kneecaps.
Hey. Did you not hear me?
shoot me.
stop.
I've worked with my share of killers.
I worked on death row.
remember?
you don't have it in you.
stop.
Carla, stop!
sorry.
Birkhoff, they're on the move. Do you copy?
all right. Okay.
sorry.
okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Mason, is that you?
operations, we've got Percy.
Fletch lives.
negative contact. Targets are still alive.
they're alive. - Open fire on everyone.
Carla was wrong. Percy's not here.
they're in the factory. Let's go.
stop right there!
did you know that Amanda called Nikita and sent her after me? - Shut up.
probably has her on speed dial.
I said,"shut up.
you were ordered to kill me, weren't you?
you're probably wondering, like I am, where Amanda's getting her orders from these days.
as soon as I get back, I guarantee you, there will be no doubt about authority.
and you will be rewarded.
smart kid.
he has a future.
wait, wait. Just wait. We called a doctor we trust, okay?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. - Carla, please don't.
we made a deal...
Percy and I.
we made a deal.
to save Division.
to make it good.
like it was supposed to be.
like I know it can be.
I know it can be.
because it made you.
it made you.
we're setting up another safe house.
you can lay low until this all blows over.
you think it's ever gonna blow over?
it has to.
I don't know what happened, Nik.
I told her to stop. She wouldn't stop.
the gun just went off.
she knew what she was doing.
you got that?
she knew.
Yeah.
all I'm seeing are details on guard rotations, nothing about my mother.
what about that file?
it's the only one that's been updated recently.
Yeah, it's a personnel record for a deep cover operative, codenamed Ohotnik.
it means hunter.
nice. Deep cover. Where?
mi-6. British intelligence.
Ari said that he had someone in a foreign agency.
someone he was gonna use to kill Semak.
so who is it?
we know her.
you were right about this.
it's too dangerous to keep around.
you never know how close your enemies are gonna be.
Cassandra, my asset. She helped me topple ovechkin.
this is my son, Max.
micheal is Max's father.
she seems to have a history of hiding the truth.
you're british intelligence? - Yes.
sergel semak ordered my father's death.
the only reason he has control of zetrov is because the world believes all of the udinovs are dead.
everything he has is rightfully yours.
an udinov will run zetrov once again.
as long as there's a camera nearby, semak won't risk an attack.
I've been working for a long time to bring him down.
I'm facing knives at every turn.
Semak must be dealt with before he kills us both.
and the kill will be pinned on a foreign intelligence service.
I have a mole burrowed deep within that agency.
london
Max is growing up.
looks more like his father all the time.
how did he take ovechkin's death?
I think the change in scenery has done him good.
and how about his mother?
I've settled in.
I've never given you more than you could handle, have i?
no. I can make this work.
you always do.
cassandra was put in belarus by mi-6 to spy for the british.
but according to this...
the whole time she was also working for gogol.
women make the best double agents.
trust me.
Ari told you he had a mole lined up to do the hit.
now if this means what I think it means, then belarus barbie is going to kill semak.
which is you want, right? - Of course.
well, then what's the problem?
you don't have to do that.
yeah I do.
besides, there's not that many handymen that specialize in bullet holes.
it's okay to mourn her.
I know carla was like a mother to you.
who taught me not to trust mother figures.
Lemme give you a hand with that, okay?
Hey, Alex, what's up?
I'm sending you over something we stole from ari's computer.
it's a personnel file on a mole.
who is he?
it's a she. She's mi-6.
what?
what are you doing? - Watch the house.
where are you going?
I'm going to london to get my son.
wait, wait a minute- - For what?
Cassandra, we just found out, is gogol.
and gogol is the enemy.
Yes, but Max is innocent. - I know.
that's why I'm going to bring him back here.
here. Where there's no danger at all.
what happened to finishing this fight?
we don't. We get out.
and we go somewhere where they can't find us, and we live there.
we get out? We go somewhere?
are you listening to yourself? We raise a kid?
Yes! Absolutely.
no, Nikita, let me make myself clear.
I love you.
and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
it's just that it's been very hard making these pieces fit.
between you, now Max, this war with division-Maybe...
this will work.
I think you're getting ahead of yourself.
no, I don't think I am.
then...
I think...
I think you're getting ahead of me.
I'm not... Mother material, Micheal.
why not?
because I'm-it's friday, and my life is insane and not stable.
and Max has a mother.
whose lies are putting him in danger.
he would be better off with you than her.
what you're talking about is kidnapping.
taking him away from his mother to be raised by strangers.
it's gonna mess him up. Trust me.
you don't want him to pay for the mistakes of both of his parents.
you gotta confront her, face-to-face.
mi-6 HEADQUARTERS LONDON
for a while now we've known gogol agents were trying to steal plans for our new drone.
finally we've been able to identify the courier they're using.
I think you will agree this is very troubling.
troubling.
Madame director, it's a provocation.
I'm dispatching your team to russia immediately.
I want you to teach gogol a lesson.
moscow
so you won't tell me what's bothering you?
Sean, I told you, this has nothing to do with you
I'd say it does.
if it affects the hit on semak, it affects my ability to protect you.
must be the tv crew. - They're not due for a while.
Semak. Why are you here?
search the rooms! - For what?
Katya-I know she's here. - She's not.
whoever told you you were a good liar, they were lying to you.
you didn't take her? - Why would i?
so that I couldn't see her.
where is she? - I told you-I don't know!
let him go.
you could have just knocked.
several days ago she ran away.
if she didn't come here, she must have gone to a place you know about.
you must help me find her.
and why would I help you?
because we both love her.
I know you think all I ever wanted was zetrov, and I kept katya as a trophy, but it's not the truth.
he's pretty good - I almost believed him.
I did.
M1\I-6 SAFE HOUSE MOSCOW - Anything? - Nothing yet.
do you know what always amazes me about the russians?
they're the only people who drink as much as we do?
I was gonna say how much they like the cold, but you're right.
hard to believe they built an empire when half the time they couldn't even march in a straight line.
and how is that any different than the british?
we're better looking.
Ay-up, there's the courier.
and far as I can tell...
the coast is clear.
good.
all I ask is you bring it back in one piece.
yourself, not so much
toggling street cam.
I've got eyes on the courier.
Tony, can you enhance that?
what is it?
probably nothing.
probably?
I'm going to check it out.
in case nothing turns into something.
how did you find me? - What's the gun for?
micheal, I am on a mission. - For mi-6 or for gogol?
I have a mole too. - I never wanted this.
micheal, I've been trying to get out for years!
so you've been gogol
since I was too young to know better.
they're going to be looking for me.
well, you better talk fast.
I was born in kletsk, raised in oxford, that is all true.
Gogol approached me when I was 19.
to spy for them? Or to work as a honeytrap?
I was broke, it was exciting.
I got to travel, see the world...
infiltrate british intelligence, sleep with a few dictators, maybe have a kid along the way.
Max is the one true thing in my world.
he is why I have to get out.
you've never done anything you regretted the rest of your life?
I did...
and it got my whole family killed.
that is why I'm here
to make sure that doesn't happen to Max.
so am i.
I finally convinced ari to let me leave gogol, retire from mi-6.
this is my last mission.
if you survive it. - Why wouldn't I survive it?
killing sergel semak is hardly a soft target.
semak? What does he have to do with this?
Cassandra, just give it up. I know.
this is just a hunting pack - Surveillance only.
mi-6 is supposed to grab a case containing phony blueprints.
Ari wants them chasing a mole that doesn't exist.
either you're lying or ari is.
I swear...
on our son's life.
Stuart is not here to assassinate anybody.
who's stuart?
the agent tailing the courier to lenin square right now.
lenin square?
that's zetrov headquarters.
that's where the courier's leading your man.
this is a frame job.
Stuart is not going to be the assassin
no, he's going to be the patsy.
Nikita, the agent you're following is walking into a trap.
makes sense.
shoot him-finger mi-6 for killing semak.
it's easier to plant a smoking gun on a corpse.
sir.
thank you for coming.
this better be worth it.
I have some information about something i'd like to share.
of should I say someone.
you found katya?
I would ask you to accompany me, but this is a delicate matter.
timur, you and your men stay here until I return.
follow me.
he was about to take a shot at me!
somebody jumped him!
she's a pro
abort the mission and get out of there.
not while they're having a go at each other
I can grab the case.
stop.
are you okay? - Yeah, better than him.
who are you? Americans?
CIA.
what are you doing here?
same thing you were.
hang on, where you going with that?
sorry. It's ours. - How do you figure?
there's two of us, and one of you.
Cheers.
how can you believe anything that man says?
he was afraid, sean. He couldn't hide it.
but you're not going to actually help him find your mother?
I don't know where she is.
right now, i'm not even sure who she is.
my mother betrayed the country.
but at the end of the day, I will do anything in my power to keep her safe.
what-what did I say?
I'm glad you're looking out for me, sean.
I know I don't always make it easy.
well, nothing worth doing is ever easy.
Alex, we're ready for you.
so Alex, what's it like?
being back after all these years?
it's surreal.
uncle sergel has restored the house completely.
so when I walk down the halls, I still expect my mother and father to come out to greet me.
even though I know that's not possible.
if they did... What would you say to them?
that I love them.
and I miss them very much.
especially my mother.
why do you say that?
the last time we were together we had a quarrel.
I didn't understand how she was acting, what she was saying.
but I've had some time to think about it.
and I think that I understand what she must have been going through.
if I could just see her again, I would try to make things right between us.
INTERWIEWWITH ALWXANDRA UDINOV
I miss her so much.
is katya okay?
you're taking me to her, right?
this isn't about katya.
but it couldn't wait any longer.
who did this?
it must've been mi-6. - Why oleg?
he wasn't the target. You were.
at least that's what the story was going to be.
correction. What it's still going to be.
what story?
the story of your fall.
and my rise.
good to see you.
I mean, aside from you being on every tv and newsstand in the country.
too much?
just as long as you remember it's not about you.
you're fighting for something much bigger than yourself.
this must've been under the door.
fan mail? - How did it go with cassandra?
did you stop her from making the hit?
for now. That's why we're here.
we're trying to help you find another way to take semak down.
since, you know, I was in the neighborhood.
we can't stay for long. If ari finds out we're here, then it'll blow everything.
someone called from the front desk.
he didn't a message, no phone number.
it says it's from babochka. - Who's babochka?
it's not a person, it's a place.
the family dacha. We used to hunt babochka there.
butterflies.
it's my mother. She got my message.
she's telling me where she is.
Semak's been murdered.
they cornered us in the alleyway...
we tried to fend them off, but they shot oleg.
and then they executed sergel.
did you get a good look at them?
it happened too fast.
but judging by their accents and their firearms, my first guess would be mi-6.
what?
Spyder found evidence that a group of their agents landed in moscow hours ago.
they set up shop in an abandoned storefront by pushkin square. Assemble a team immediately.
I want the men responsible for this dead before they leave russia.
of course.
Hello?
no, no-it's too soon.
people will get suspicious.
in a day or two.
what is it?
that was ari. Sergel semak is dead.
that's what you wanted, right?
how do you feel?
empty.
it's all I've thought about for so long.
now that it's happened...
I feel...
just...
revenge never turns out the way you think that it would.
something's not right.
Ari goes through all the trouble to find a fall guy, we prevent that, and he kills semak anyway?
there's a safe house full of fall guys.
Ari knows exactly where it is. - We'll help you.
no, you have a lead on your mother.
you gotta find her.
okay.
you can't honestly want us to tuck tail and run?
our jet is waiting on the tarmac.
you can come with, or hitch another ride on your own.
how did they find us so quickly?
Darren, are you all right?
looks worse than it is.
try not to move, mate.
hold your fire, i'm coming in!
CIA. I'm here to help.
you.
she's one of the yanks who pinched our intel.
how did you make us
later. My partner's out there holding them off.
my guess is back up'll be here any minute.
come on.
you two have a knack for timing, i'll grant you that.
what are you waiting for, an invite from the queen? Get in!
just like I remember.
what the hell? - What's wrong?
Gogol? - No, division.
you're right. I've seen those guys around ops.
what are they doing here?
drop your weapons now!
Alexandra! What are you doing?
these men are protecting me.
I gave you nine men.
we had the british dead to rights.
then Nikita came out of nowhere.
Nikita?
are you sure it was her?
her and her partner ambushed us.
I think they were working with mi-6.
I saw them take off in a car together.
mi-6 couldn't have tipped them off.
but somebody else might have.
I've sent you a file. I need you to leak it for me.
to mi-6.
let's see how fast they turn on cassandra.
we don't have much time, do we?
the debrief officers are driving up from london.
they'll take our after-action reports, try to contact your superiors at langley
and discover we don't actually work for the cia.
maybe I can distract them while you slip away.
no, I think we can actually fight our way out of here.
you want my help?
Yeah, act surprised.
don't forget your tea.
pretend this is not control.
act as if we're chatting about something mundane, the weather for example.
it's warmer here than in Moscow.
Yes, it is.
cassandra is a gogol spy.
are you sure it's gonna rain?
look, I can show you the intercept
I look forward to it.
I convinced the goons to give you guys some privacy.
you threaten to knock heads? - More like knocking glasses.
go easy on 'em. - I won't.
sergel loved me.
I know.
but that love got your father killed.
knowing that made it impossible to stay with him.
he sent men looking for you.
one of them found me. ari.
he said he was on my side, that he had no love for sergel as well.
he even posted american guards to protect me, so sergel would never know I was here.
why did you come here?
because everybody had forgotten it.
except me.
when I remember the three of us as a family, I think about this place.
you were very young. Pfft... As were we.
it was back when nikolal wasn't an oligarch.
he was just a father.
Priviet.
Yes, I'm fine. I'm here with Alexandra.
Yes, I called her.
I keep underestimating your resourcefulness.
you also keep lying to me.
I was planning it as a surprise.
I was going to tell you at the appropriate time.
and when was that?
once semak was out of the picture. Otherwise you would have led him straight to her.
this was what I was hoping to meet with you about.
well, that and one other matter-I have a proposition for you.
so, stuart...You got quiet all of a sudden.
well, there's not much to say, is there?
it always amazes me what people keep to themselves, don't you think?
I was supposed to die, wasn't i?
that guy I was following, he was no courier
Stuart, I don't know what you're talking about.
you damn well know! So does control.
she's gogol.
just because the mission failed doesn't mean it was compromised.
when you slipped out of the house back there, did you give us up?
were you talking to someone?
excuse our mess.
hell, if it hadn't been for the cia sticking their noses into our business, we'd all be dead...
and gogol would probably be pinning you with a medal.
good, keep your mouth shut.
make us torture it out of you
don't make me shoot the other one.
I'm sorry.
mi-6 will be all over heathrow and gatwick, but not where we're headed.
how far back are they? - I can't see them anymore.
don't take your foot off the gas, we haven't lost them yet.
we need to get Max, now.
is he at home? - With gerald, the sitter.
mi-6 will be heading there. We have to hurry.
mi-6 is on our tail now. If you want to keep Max safe, you lead them in the opposite direction.
no, they will use him as leverage.
she's right. - We need to get him.
I'll get him.
they're on the lookout for you, not me.
call your sitter, tell him to take Max for a walk in regent's park.
Hey, I'm not gonna let your son grow up without his parents.
I'm putting him in your arms, today. I promise.
you gotta keep driving.
you don't want me to slow down?
a little.
you want me to sign over all my shares in zetrov over to you.
you'll be well-compensated, of course.
and why would I do that?
to assure your mother's continued safety.
you'll be free to go with her wherever you like.
don't take my word for it.
congratulations, you won.
why don't you put us on speaker?
I think your mother should hear this as well.
when you transfer your shares to ari, we will give you and katya enough money to live well for the rest of your lives.
that's not what this is about.
of course it is. You never wanted zetrov anyway.
I'm sending you a contract.
you might wanna answer that, gerald.
Cassandra?
Yes, of course. He's playing with his jet.
she's right here.
okay, I guess I can do that.
there it is.
she got him out.
thank god.
Yes.
I think we should tell him you're his father.
I don't think it's the right time right now.
if he missed me before- - Maybe he won't have to.
maybe you could come with us.
you risk your life to get us out of trouble.
get yourself out as well.
Cassandra, remember when you were talking about Max being the thing that gets you through life
no matter how hard it gets or how tough it gets...
I knew what you were saying...
because I have someone like that too.
there's no way i'm gonna leave her.
I'm afraid, Micheal.
we'll get you to safety- - For how long?
now I have two intelligence services hunting me... And Max.
every moment i'll be wondering if the other shoe is about to drop.
that is never going to happen.
we're not gonna let it.
I have a lead on cassandra.
she used her expense account to charter a private plane.
so I closed the account, but the transaction's still going through.
mi-6 must have gotten the message.
she's feeling the heat.
you want me to send a team?
no. Track the plane.
we'll be waiting wherever she lands.
you're not actually considering this, are you?
how could I not?
you can't let them force you into doing this.
it's not about that. It's about getting what we deserve.
and that is what they will give us.
nobody gives you anything, mama.
you have to earn what you get.
zetrov belonged to papa.
and do you know how he earned it?
other people's blood.
it's not a company. It's a curse.
and now we have the chance to rid ourselves of it.
you think it's a curse now - Imagine what it'll be like if amanda gets hold of it.
zetrov destroyed your father. And sergel.
it will destroy them as well.
don't let it destroy you. Let it go.
you should listen to your mother, Alex.
she knows what's best.
no she doesn't. You do.
so I get what I want...If you get what you want.
it's called "everyone wins.
except Nikita.
what?
you're pinning semak's death on cassandra. Nikita's with her now.
Nikita is not your problem, Alex. You don't need to fight her war anymore.
this is about what you deserve.
that's just the thing, amanda. You don't deserve to win.
and I'm not gonna let you.
if you walk out that door, we will hunt you down.
mama!
we're not out of the woods yet.
are you sure you want to do this?
Yeah, i'll do whatever it takes.
control, i'm at the airfield.
no, we're too late. She just took off.
we can figure that out later. Contact raf brampton.
tell them to scramble jets to intercept a turbo-prop, tail markings lima, tango, alpha, kilo
bloody thing just burst apart.
it was a gogol jet-They must've slipped a bomb on board.
she got what was coming to her.
Cassandra's plane has disappeared.
where did it go?
down. The emergency crews are looking for survivors.
there won't be any.
another one of mi-6's "accidents.
my flight got canceled. I'm gonna need a ride.
we'll see you soon.
I don't know how to thank you enough.
we'll think of something.
and we'll be safe there?
Yes, you will. Sean's gonna take good care of you.
but I thought we would be going together.
mama, I want to be with you more than anything.
it's not that simple.
I'm a part of something much bigger.
and I want to be a part of that fight.
you are so strong.
is this what your father taught you?
Nyet.
now that nobody's looking for you, you shouldn't have a problem getting out.
it's a little hard to believe I'm "dead.
you get used to it.
I'm sure Max will miss his...Friend.
we'll be in touch.
Yeah. I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.
Look...You're going to disappear.
but I'm not.
those people that are after you-If they were to track me down, follow me and bug me.
I could lead them right to you, right to Max.
and I would never forgive myself if that happened.
that means I can't tell him about his father.
I know.
you... Be safe.
you too.
both of you.
good-bye, Micheal.
good-bye, Max.
thank you.
you're doing the right thing. - Am i?
when I was growing up, I thought that any parent that gave their child up was unforgivable.
that there would never be a reason or an excuse for it.
and now I'm standing here.
what you did...Was an act of grace.
you're a good father, Micheal.
Maxwell AIR FORCE STATION
Maxwell AIR FORCE STATION NORTH DAKOTA
we're one of the top satellite facilities in the country.
I'm talking tracking, telemetry, control.
only NORAD's got more birds up there.
let me show you the command center.
really glad to have you here. We're seriously understaffed.
these motherboards. Where are they?
what?
these haven't been active in 20 years.
get 'em.
there's not a lot of hardware around that can run these.
I don't know who'd want them.
I do.
it's going to take some time to install these.
they're ancient by today's standards.
then you must treat them as you would a precious artifact...
with great respect.
the fate of the world lies in your hands.
so do be careful.
you were born here.
and you were always meant to die here.
division is going to change the world.
he's planning something big.
radioactive
first, he's going nuclear.
welcome home, Nikita.
it's okay.
I'm awake.
good Morning.
good morning.
we should get going.
I don't have to be anywhere.
I can't get him out of my head, Michael.
I never thought he'd come between you and me, at least not here.
he's this close to getting a nuclear weapon, and everything goes quiet.
are you thinking what I'm thinking?
storm's coming.
impressive, but weird.
it's not weird. - It's not normal.
you're the judge of what's normal?
it's voodoo, man. - What is?
good morning.
Fletch here is the data whisperer.
I figured Percy is gonna need engineering help with his nuclear plans, so, I'm trolling through the CIA data Kendrick gave us to see where he might find it, and I happen to notice...
that three former aerospace guys in their 60s all died from natural causes in the last two weeks.
what's weird about that?
talent KEYHOLE
well, an expert swimmer drowns in his pool, then a guy with no coronary problems has a heart attack, and the last one dies from anaphylactic shock. But he never had any allergies.
anaphylactic shock was a division staple.
we used that all the time.
so just for giggles, Johnny Mnemonic here has me run a check.
turns out all three of these guys were posted at Maxwell air force station back in the mid -'80s.
like I said, voodoo.
they were working on a classified satellite project called "crossbow" along with two other guys
Henderson and Mizuyama, both of whom are still alive, as far as I can tell.
what would Percy want with a satellite?
communication, intelligence, navigation...
navigation.
damn it.
what?
well, the early ballistic missiles used navigation satellites for targeting.
if Percy was able to hijack one, then...
he could use it to guide a missile.
he's already got enough plutonium for a warhead.
get Alex and Sean over here.
I gotta call director Kendrick.
I'm in with the president, hammering out the final details on the Afghan-Taliban peace treaty, so this had better be good.
I think we know what Percy's up to.
it's got something to do with Maxwell air force station.
how the hell do you know about the attack?
what attack?
I just got a call from Maxwell.
some gunman took out the staff and stole control hardware.
they i. d. Him? - Security cameras caught him, but he doesn't appear in any of our databases.
that's because he doesn't exist.
another one of Percy's ghosts.
here's the security tape from Maxwell air force station.
Robbie. - Who's Robbie?
he's a recruit. He snapped.
he went on a shooting spree inside Division.
we were told he'd been canceled.
fake death special. - Yeah. Tell me about it.
you got enough to run a facial recog?
sure. Coming up.
are you okay?
I knew him.
for a minute, I thought I could save him.
I know.
you know, I get why Percy wants to hijack satellites, but why kill retired engineers?
what we do know is they want him dead, which means we want him alive.
Percy's making his move. We gotta get ahead of him, guys.
any luck finding the other two?
nothing on Mizuyama, but Henderson...
feds keep track of guys who used to have top secret clearance.
accessing DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
last entry's 16 years ago. Says he's off the grid.
dropped out of society?
colloquially, yeah.
literally, off the electrical grid.
no bills from the power company.
so how do we track him? - Propane.
propane, power source of choice for the off-grider.
and you can't get a big tank without making a deposit, so...
searching "PROPANE DEPOSIT"
search COMPLETE
Yeah, sometimes I amaze even myself.
got my own magic, voodoo man.
Donald Henderson recently purchased two tanks of propane near an abandoned shipyard in Philly.
okay, so he's still alive.
maybe.
facial RECOGNITION MATCH
or maybe not.
shadownet just coughed out a hit on Robbie.
security cam has him boosting a motorcycle in a back alley.
Birkhoff, if he's after Henderson, we're too late. Can you warn him?
wait, hold on. It's a false alarm.
Robbie's not heading to the shipyard.
in fact, he's not even in Philadelphia.
he's in... Upstate New York.
Adirondacks, route 86, headed north.
that's away from division. Where the hell's he going?
let me take him.
please? Okay.
you guys find Robbie.
Michael... We go after Henderson.
Dr. Henderson.
you're from the government, aren't you?
no.
see? That's what you always do.
you lie, you lie about who you are.
we just want to talk to you.
yeah? That's the way it always starts.
next thing you know, you got electrodes attached to your privates.
tell us about project crossbow.
if you're not from the government, how do you know about crossbow?
look, we don't have a lot of time.
yeah? - Too bad.
cause I got nothing to say.
it's over, it's finished.
I moved on. I suggest you do the same.
if you won't talk to us, tell us how we can reach Keith Mizuyama.
he's in danger, and so are you.
we need to reach him.
he's dead.
ten years ago, cancer got him.
what's Robbie doing in the Adirondacks?
who the hell's Robbie?
he's the guy who stole the control boards.
somebody's after crossbow? Wait a second.
you're not telling me those fools actually got it online?
what do you mean,"got it online"?
the satellite's already in orbit.
I know, I put it there.
Oh, man.
I knew it, I knew they'd find a way to make it work.
nothing gets in the way of our military boys, no, Sir, especially not scientists.
it's my fault. Look at me.
I thought I could save mankind.
what did I do?
I gave it a way to commit suicide.
how is this your fault? What does crossbow do?
you have no idea, do you?
get down.
Henderson?
now what?
research REACTOR LIPSTATE NEW YORK
what is this place?
what's with the flying saucers?
your tax dollars at work.
some kind of... Government research reactor.
that's the bike Robbie stole.
you think Mizuyama's here?
for his sake, I hope not.
Alex, we don't have to worry about Mizuyama anymore.
according to Henderson, he's been dead for a while.
Nikita, we're standing outside a nuclear reactor.
if Robbie isn't after this guy, what is he doing here?
spotted him.
all right, I gotta go.
hands.
never thought I'd see you again.
likewise. On your knees.
walk away and I won't hurt you.
I'm the one holding the gun.
you have no idea who you're dealing with.
see, I'm not that same recruit you once knew.
neither am I.
I'm a cleaner now, Alex.
you know how many people I've dissolved in acid?
you were friends with this guy?
it's no fun living alone for this long.
lot of meals spent by yourself.
it's not cold.
project
Birkhoff, we found something.
bringing it back. You got a way to play betamax?
what are you doing here, Robbie?
I know Percy's up to something big.
well, if you won't tell me what you're up to, at least tell me how you got here.
we were told you were going to be executed.
so was I.
but then Division saved my life again.
said that I showed them something, some depth they didn't know I had, the way I murdered those guards without hesitation.
they made you a killer, Robbie.
I am a killer.
Percy's the only one that doesn't want to change that.
in fact, he's made me a better one.
I tried to get you out.
I offered to sneak you through those vents.
and I know why now - 'cause you're a traitor.
Percy told me how you turned on Division.
Percy's the one who turned on Division.
bet you don't even know what you're doing here.
whatever it is, it's probably gonna get a lot of people killed, yourself included.
you didn't save my life, Alex.
division did.
I'm willing to die for them if I have to.
what do you make of this?
can't tell if it's a transmitter or a receiver.
I'd say let's beat it out of him, but I think he'd only enjoy it.
where did you dig up that thing?
found it in a box next to my parachute pants.
let's hope he didn't tape a ball game over it.
Hello, I am Dr. Donald Henderson, lead scientist of project crossbow, which is the key component of president ronald reagan's strategic defense initiative.
to shield the nation from a Soviet nuclear strike.
crossbow will be a series of military satellites equipped with particle beam weapons.
once in orbit, these satellites will target and destroy incoming soviet missiles.
guess there's a reason they called it star wars.
"star wars"?
this thing worked about as well as the phantom menace.
it's a missile defense system that couldn't hit any missiles.
that's why they pulled the plug before it even got off the ground.
then why does Percy want it?
what does he know that we don't know?
before he died, Henderson was so freaked out that he thought they'd gotten crossbow online.
maybe they did.
what if Percy's satellite isn't meant to guide missiles?
what if the satellite is the weapon?
Birkhoff, I thought you said this thing couldn't hit the broad side of a barn.
well, it couldn't hit a moving target, but it might be able to hit a fixed object on the ground.
wait, it can reach the earth?
if this thing had enough juice, yeah.
you're talking about a lightning bolt that melts through anything in its path.
how do we stop it?
you ask the scientist who built it to find a weakness, only they're all dead.
so if Percy got rid of all the guys who could disarm it, then...
he basically has control of his own personal death star.
Where's Ryan?
in Washington, briefing Kendrick.
good, get him on the phone.
we need to bring one of the higher-ups into this.
we can't-we can't stop this on our own.
what makes you think Kendrick can?
I had someone else in mind.
if we weren't in the oval office, I'd swear that I was being punk'd.
I assure you, Mr. President, this is not a joke.
do you have any proof?
Fletcher's been working with a team of covert operatives who've been monitoring the situation for quite some time now.
and you trust these people?
with my life, Sir.
so I'm under threat from something that this government created, though I wasn't told about it.
actually, two threats, Sir. - Excuse me?
they're also in possession of a satellite weapon from the SDI program.
the boards are green.
you have full control of the satellite.
all right, excellent.
task crossbow to... these coordinates.
let me take her up for a spin.
I know you killed those people at the satellite base.
I know if I turn you over to the military, you're going to disappear down a hole for a very long time.
and part of me doesn't want that to happen.
I remember when we were recruits.
you tried to help me get through it.
you told me to focus on the future, on the knowledge that I would get out.
it's hard for me to take your future away, Robbie.
let me go.
not until you tell me what you know.
Percy's no future either.
do what you have to do.
all right.
let's get out of here.
I'm sorry, Robbie.
get out of here or you won't have a future either.
he flipped a switch on this thing? What does it do?
nothing, as far as I can tell.
but he thought it was worth dying for.
could be anything.
a transmitter, a beacon, the golden snitch.
Birkhoff, pull me up a satellite view of the Adirondack reactor.
the satellite fired its retro-rockets and changed its trajectory.
we no longer have control.
damn it.
if we had this weapon in our arsenal, why didn't you tell me about it?
sir, the CIA was kept out of the loop, too.
is that the hot phone?
yes? - My name is Percival Rose, and I created Division. Ring a bell?
it's him.
black ops, deeply covert branch of your government...
no worries.
we're need-to-know.
and besides, we've spun off on our own recently.
spun out of control sounds more like it.
you are playing with fire.
you might put it that way, Mr. President.
I have commandeered an SDI satellite and re-tasked it to a position above the eastern seaboard.
hard as that may be for you to believe
our people have been monitoring the situation for some time now.
kudos.
glad to have you up to speed.
now the demonstration will have greater impact.
what demonstration?
what demonstration?
watch the birdie.
okay, what would the military use to target long range weapons?
GPS, mostly.
no, I mean, like, in the '80s.
well, they'd get a spotter close enough to paint the target with some sort of homing beacon to...
transmit coordinates.
the facility just had a big power spike.
I don't see a laser.
Yeah, the beam's invisible, but it's heating up the reactor like gas on a fire.
emergency SHOTDOWN
Alex, get out of there.
last we spoke, you asked how I hoped to prove myself.
do you expect me to be impressed by your feat of so-called domestic terrorism?
any hillbilly with a pickup full of fertilizer and nitrate could have done that.
but would he have the most powerful man on the planet under his control?
although I'm sure, to you and your associates, that title has a hollow ring.
I sincerely doubt you can play puppet master to the potus.
then allow me to prove myself.
what would you like the puppet to do?
let's start small.
a public statement.
if I'm satisfied, we can aim higher.
I'm aiming higher - Membership in your group.
we'll see.
as far as the president goes,
I've always admired a certain quote by Edward Teller.
I only have a few moments.
he's about to address the nation.
any word from Alex and Sean?
they're safe, they got out. Stayed upwind from the blast.
they should be back here soon.
what is the president gonna say? - What can he say?
my fellow Americans, we're "screwed"?
if the truth of this comes out, it could shatter people's faith in the government.
maybe that's what Percy wants.
I don't know.
chaos is bad for business.
deep down, Percy's all about his own self-interests.
Ryan, then why hasn't he revealed his endgame?
he called again.
Percy? What did he want?
it was an odd request.
I'm going to make some remarks, then take a few questions.
first off, our hearts and our prayers go out to the victims of this terrible tragedy.
at this moment, though details are still coming in, it appears to have been an accident.
we were fortunate that this occurred at a research reactor and loss of life was contained to the facility itself with minimal fallout.
at a trying time such as this, I am reminded of what nuclear scientist Edward teller once said.
president: "life improves slowly, and goes wrong fast, and only catastrophe is clearly visible."
his master's voice.
all right, Percy, you have our attention.
let's take this to the next level.
happily...
provided you're taking me to the next level.
I feel like somebody just stuck their hand up my backside and made my lips move.
what the hell was that quote for?
some kind of joke? Assemble my security team.
I want options on how to deal with this bastard right now.
Yes, Sir.
Hello? - Well done, Mr. President.
very convincing performance.
you got what you wanted. - That was just a test.
here's the task.
tonight, instead of signing the treaty as planned, you're going to announce the peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban have failed.
we've worked on that treaty for years.
if we pull out now, the entire region goes up in flames.
don't blame me. I'm just the messenger.
messenger for whom? - Let's keep it simple.
for the time being, I am your commander-in-chief.
that's ridiculous, I've staked my presidency on this.
are you willing to stake millions of lives on it, too?
because the next strike is going to take place in a heavily populated area, and you're not gonna be able to whitewash it.
scuttle the talks, or your presidency won't be the only thing melting down.
you have three hours.
it's as bad as we thought.
I'd say it's worse.
not only does Percy have one of the deadliest weapons ever created, he's using it to blackmail the president into committing political suicide.
president's got to have something up his sleeve.
the air force could try to shoot a missile at it or seals could do a ground assault.
it's too risky.
if Percy gets word of an attack, he'll trigger the weapon immediately.
crossbow could get another shot off before a missile hits it.
let's face it. Percy won.
we're probably next.
no, we're not. He is.
Nikita, I get that, but what do we do?
we take away his trump card...
the satellite he controls from Division.
you think I haven't thought of that?
this is ancient tech.
it's all about the motherboards, not the software.
you can't hack it.
I'm not talking about hacking it.
I'm talking about going into Division.
are you kidding? We can't go at that place.
why not? - Because it's suicide.
so is the alternative.
I've been running from Division for five years, running and running and running while Percy gets stronger.
I am not running anymore.
I don't want to go in there, Michael.
I have to.
this ends today.
Nikki, you have flirted with the crazy before, but this is flat-out starkers.
I am not talking about knocking on the front door, genius.
I'm talking about a surgical strike.
all right, let's approach this tactically.
what exactly are we talking about here?
horrible, gruesome death.
first, we would have to disable the crossbow control boards, break in, fight our way through teeming hoards of psycho killers, and make our way down to the server room, which is on the ninth sub-level, a.k. a. The basement of hell.
if we take the abandoned silo all the way down, we pass the main levels.
think about it.
we go in through the exhaust vent...
and straight to the server room.
the hatch was removed when Nikita escaped division.
no, it wasn't removed.
it was sealed by me.
we welded it shut with steel brackets.
we can blow through that.
okay, but let's not forget that, to even get to the hatch, we have to get past the farm, which is manned by two full-time sentries, and don't let their civilian cover fool you.
ma and Pakent are still Division agents.
Sean and I can handle them.
and you can't kill them.
if they die, their trackers go offline, and somebody in ops notices that...
horrible, gruesome death.
all right. Birkhoff, you quarterback.
Sean and Alex, you get us in.
michael and I will infiltrate.
we get down to the server room.
we plant a charge that can be remotely detonated.
when we exfil, we blow the charge.
Hey, listen, Nikki...
I really hope this isn't the last time we ever see each other.
thanks for reminding me, nerd.
I'm the one whose ass is on the line.
I know.
may the force be with you.
Mikey, you can kick my ass when you get back, okay, buddy?
will do.
it's crazy, right?
the attack.
it's definitely a hail mary, but I think we can pull it off.
Michael, I don't want to do the thing where I'm deciding for everybody.
you're not.
we all know what we're getting into.
if this goes wrong...
my worst nightmare is dying in that hellhole without you.
that's never gonna happen.
you can't get rid of me that easily.
options.
bunker buster. We drop a GBU-28 on them.
it worked in Iraq.
it did, madame vice president, except this facility was designed to withstand a nuclear attack.
what about sending in special forces?
all the entrances to Division are choke points.
they could hold off ten times their number.
it'd be a bloodbath.
and once any offensive action is detected, Percy will instantly activate crossbow.
so what are you telling me?
that the combined might of the united states military forces is helpless against a madman?
in New Jersey?
Thanks, Jack.
be back for that baling wire tomorrow.
so you later.
easy.
now we're even.
Nikita, we're on our way. Meet you at the designated spot.
listen, you're the only one of us in there who knows Percy...
and can admit it.
I need you to remain here as my liaison while I go back to Langley and work up those casualty figures.
wait, Sir. We cannot send in the marines.
that's not up to me.
all we need is a little more time.
is there something I should know about?
not if you ever need to deny it.
I hope to be pleasantly surprised, Fletcher.
but you're on your own.
Yeah, things are spinning out here.
you better have some good news.
too soon to tell.
they just started their run.
straight to the mouth of doom.
target has eyes on me.
Dalton?
now I owe you one.
keep them out of sight.
we'll be back as soon as we can.
almost there.
okay, I register two standard Division trackers.
no other signals or listening devices.
they're clean.
Nikki, how you guys doing?
home, sweet home.
damn. - What is it?
ladder's gone.
Amanda must have taken it out when she retrofitted the place for Percy's cell.
looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way.
that's why you're gonna lower me down.
what?
splitting up wasn't a part of the plan.
you got a better idea?
at most, there'll be two techs in the server room.
I get down, I plant the charge, I'm back up before you know it.
fine. I'll go.
Michael, no, you're too heavy for me to lower.
not that I'm dissing your girlish figure.
the first sign of trouble, you get the hell out of there.
you scare the crap out of me, but I love you anyway.
I love you anyway, too.
Alexandra Udinov, the traitor.
nice to meet you, too.
what are you doing here?
is this a Gogol attack?
or some rogue action with Nikita?
you can't possibly think you can take on division on your own.
doesn't matter.
whatever you're trying to do, it won't work.
we'll stop you.
division will stop you.
how long you been working on this cover?
months? Years?
long enough to see what life outside of Division is like.
division is what makes this life possible.
no.
division is what is keeping you from having a life.
if Division dies, you can live.
I'm in.
thank the maker.
tech support is down.
okay, the communications server is the middle column.
which panel?
the one with all the blinking lights.
Thanks, that helps me a lot.
you're gonna have to feel around for it.
find the one that pops open.
Nikita's reached the server room.
halfway home.

you had it wrong.

you don't have a minute.

Nikita, you are burned. - Not yet.
all right, I'm coming down.
Mikey, don't do it. It'll never hold your weight.
okay, we're onsite.
the techs have been neutralized.
Michael, blow the charge.
wait. If I blow this now, they'll be swarming all over the place.
you'll be trapped.

they're in here!
they're about to find it. It's our only shot.

blow the charge!
then allow me to prove myself.
if I'm satisfied, we can aim higher.
I'm aiming higher. Membership in your group.
we'll see.
damn. Percy's going nuclear. - And Nikita?
she just thinks i'm building a bomb.
well, the early ballistic missiles used navigation satellites for targeting.
what if the satellite is the weapon?
I have commandeered an s. d.i. Satellite.
all right, Percy. You have our attention.
let's take this to the next level.
Mr. President, you're going to announce that peace talks between the afghan government and the taliban have failed.
Percy doesn't get to win. - Nikita, what do we do?
we take away his trump card...
the satellite he controls from division.
Birkhoff, you quarterback. Alex and sean, you take out the division agents that control the entrance.
michael and I will infiltrate.
are you kidding? We can't go in that place. - It's suicide.
blow the charge!
everyone, stop!
just calm down.
you don't want to do this.

open it or he dies.
I can't.
let me out of here.
there is no out.
Michael, crossbow's down.
Percy's satellite is disabled.
still training 'em real well down here.
Birkhoff, copy back.
status?
the explosion took out server two, but core systems are intact.
exits are sealed.
this is Percy. Division has been breached.
weapons restrictions have been lifted.
you may arm yourselves at will.
michael and Nikita are in the facility.
find them, kill them, and you will be rewarded.
Alex, are you there?
Yeah, I'm taking fire!
just lost Nikita and michael.
same here!
damn it. It's gotta be a lockdown.
I'm out!
here. - Alex!
what do you mean, dead?
no signal traffic in or out.
only the guards can talk on a dedicated line.
division lockdown is designed for when a recruit tries to escape.
or an exrecruit breaks in.
also means I can't tell you if the big particle beam in the sky is offline or not.
damn it. I gotta go.
Mr. President.
we're out of time, mr. Fletcher.
Percy's ultimatum was pretty clear.
sir, may we contact him?
tell him you need more time, the cabinet doesn't agree.
this lunatic's already melted down one reactor with that particle beam.
I will not stand by and watch him do it near a major city.
I have to play along for now. Do you understand?
are the marines in place?
they're about a mile from the farm.
sir, I think you should reconsider the military option, especially against division.
is there something that you're not telling us?
the covert operatives I was working with Two of them are inside division right now.
doing what?
trying to disable the satellite.
I don't know if they've succeeded, but I do know if you send those marines in, they'll be pinned down.
I'm about to kill a peace treaty that this country's been praying for for a decade.
do you think my presidency's gonna survive that?
if I go down, Percy goes down.
as for your people, they're on their own.
Michael, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
we're on the party line.
awesome. Hey, division.
it's great to be back. I've missed you.
they're on the security channel.
look. We can't update birkhoff until we get up top.
I need to get you out of here.
where do you want to meet?
well, the only place in division we ever had any fun.
copy that.
live FROM THE WHITHE HOUSE
good evening, everyone.
I've come to the conclusion that certain warrior cultures are incapable of finding peace, and it is for this reason and many others that I officially withdraw my support for this treaty.
it is deeply flawed, and it does not serve america's interests to support it.
peace may come, but not here, and sadly, not tonight.
call off lockdown. - Sir?
I need to make a phone call.
lockdown ACTIVE
lockdown CLEARED
it is for this reason and for many others...
that I officially withdraw my support...
I'm watching.
ask and ye shall receive.
knock and the door shall be opened.
so I'm in.
the group has approved your status.
however, you may have another problem heading your way.
those are u. s. Marines.
vehicle signatures confirm it.
you sure this is the only place we ever had fun?
sounds like we're about to have some more.
how many?
multispectral analysis puts the number of troops at...
205
I don't understand. Division's part of government.
why would the marines be here?
I asked for them.
they're here to make sure that Nikita and her little band of insurgents don't escape the perimeter.
it won't be an issue if we find them first.
I'm almost up top.
what are the jarheads doing?
they're in fourman units, taking positions along the perimeter.
they're making the cordon. It's usually followed by a raid.
they don't know us from the real targets, so just sit tight.
that's the only way to sit right now.
you all right?
there's only one way for this to go.
downhill.
after this whole thing's overyou know, this whole storm the castle, save humanity thing I think you and me ought to go on a proper date.
are you kidding me?
Hey, come on. Let me down easy, why don't you?
there's literally hundreds of marines out there, and you're thinking about that?
Hey, you know, that That helps me focus.
it gives me, something to look forward to, you know?
like a goal.
you are unbelievable.
that's funny. It's not the first time I've heard that.
although usually, it's after the date.
I'm just glad you're okay.
Oh, Ryan, we'd be so much better without a couple hundred marines waiting for us.
I tried to call them off, but the president really wants Percy's head.
especially now that crossbow's down.
well, starting a war won't help.
tell the president we got a plan to hijack the comm system and get a message to everybody inside.
if they find out the truth about Percy, they'll hand him over.
hang on. Call coming in.
bold speech, Mr. President.
historical.
your satellite weapon's dead.
you won't be far behind.
see, that's why I didn't vote for you.
you don't know how to solve the problem that's right in front of you.
you're just like every tinpot dictator I've ever had to shake hands with.
you are a small man with a big chip on your shoulder, a common thug.
there's nothing common about me.
and as far as my satellite weapon being dead, it was never alive in the first place.
what the hell are you talking about?
power, Mr. President. Real power.
the kind that changes history.
the kind that cortez had over the aztecs.
they fell to their knees and gave up without a fight.
Why?
because they believed he could turn off the sun.
all he did was check the charts and saw an eclipse was coming.
you're saying there was never any satellite?
Oh, it's It's up there.
took some trouble to get control of it too.
I even retacked the trajectory just to seal the deal.
but the particle beam That was always fiction.
brilliant science fiction.
they never got that to work.
how did you blow the reactor?
very Easy.
put a little plutonium inside a demon core, and the next thing you know, kaboom.
a cataclysmic reaction that you naturally took to be a laser beam from outer space.
this whole thing's been a giant con.
you, Mr. President...
in your loincloth, with a bone in your nose, trembling with fear and awe at my feet as I turn off the sun.
and I'm gonna do it again.
the remaining plutonium is in the hands of my most trusted operative.
he has orders to cause another meltdown, this time in a major metropolitan area, unless he's told to abort.
what do you want?
to surrender.
I've saved this country more times than you or anyone else will ever know.
a warrior deserves a little respect, don't you think?
I will walk out of here, mr. President, maybe not a hero, but on my own terms...
immunity and the retirement of my choosing.
if my operative doesn't hear from me in the next 30 minutes, he will proceed as planned.
what if I say no?
don't say no.
his most trusted operative.
it's gotta be roan.
Birkhoff, do you have any idea how to find him?
off the top of my head, no.
roan doesn't exactly smile for security cameras.
what about his vehicle?
he's probably using a division car.
could work, if I could get my hands on a vehicle manifest.
Nikita, we need to find roan and get the plutonium out of the equation.
I agree.
Alex and sean, you go after roan.
got it. - What about us?
we go after Percy, take him out of the equation.
I knew she was gonna say that.
unless we all think that he's gonna retire.
look, it's just another play.
he's probably got somebody waiting on the outside.
then it's settled.
are you forgetting about the marines?
I can get you past the marines.
Birkhoff, try and hack the vehicle manifest.
Nikita and michael, good luck.
alpha team seven, I've got you in the west service corridor.

I'm in a serious jam here.
I really need your help. Look.
Percy is a bad guy.
you know that, right?
just nod.
I need to find roan. It's important.
look, if Percy strikes again and another reactor melts down, those marines out there are gonna melt you down.

alpha team five, a panel's been breached inside the environmental control room on sublevel two.

the panel was opened with a small charge.
it was left here.
they were trying to draw the teams there.
why would they do that?
Freeze!
trust me. I'm not gonna move.
but if you shoot me, things might get messy.
you trained us for this, sir.
we're fully prepared to shoot you and jump on that grenade.
in the event of a breach,"the integrity of operations must be maintained.
if your actions threaten that, you regroup and form a new approach.
apparently, I didn't train you well enough.
you were probably busy training me.

finally realized what I hate about this place.
it's the hum.
Hello, Nikita.
we're not letting you go.
Michael, I'm in amanda's old place.
wait, stop.
there's an alpha team right outside.
get rid of them.
don't.
all right, everyone, listen up.
most of you people know me, and you know i'm not the enemy.
neither are they.
what did Percy tell you they were here for?
to help catch you.
they're here for Percy.
open your eyes.
Sonya, she's on sublevel four.

as we say in the trade, that's for me to know and you to find out.
where is he?
where? - You can't kill me.

the second I die, roan gets a signal.
the meltdown begins.
then I'll torture it out of you.
we got time.
no, you don't.
the search team will be here any minute.
it's gonna take longer than that to break me.
then we'll buy some time.
you're gonna get on that intercom, and you're gonna call off the boys, or I take off your boys.
they won't believe me.
sure they will, because you're gonna tell them something they've never heard before.
the truth.
this is Percy.
I'm sure you're all very curious to know what's been going on today.
I started this organization not just to pre t thoteccountry, but to save young lives, give them a new direction.
and I guess somewhere along the way, I lost direction myself.
stopped seeing you as great americans and started to view you as mercenaries.
a means to an end.
little by little, division became a criminal organization.
those marines are out there to shut us down, bring it to an end.
by morning, you'll all be dead or renditioned to a secret prison or some godforsaken place because of me.
I betrayed you, each and every one of you.
and I don't regret a minute of it.
if anybody has a problem with that, - come to my office, - You are pathetic street trash.
what are you doing?
throwing gas on the fire.
let's get him.
they don't care what happens to me.
they don't care if I die.
but you should.
you bastard.
this is your final mission, Nikita.
stop the meltdown. Save the world.
the only way to do that is to get me out of here alive.
relax.
I'm not gonna shoot you. You're my bodyguard.
I need you.
Nikita, the natives are getting restless.
you gotta move.

says he works in waste remediation at a classified government site.
he's like a super secret janitor.
it's something called n. m.r.
never heard of it. Must be over my clearance.
Mr. President?
we believe Percy may be targeting something called n. m.r.
do you know what that is?
of course.
it's the national mall reactor, right below us.
a nuclear reactor under d. c?
it's kind of a backup generator for the government.
we put it in during the y2k scare.
Birkhoff, did you get that?
I got it, and we're on it.
almost through, sir.
advance team, prepare to breach.
Nikita, there's an alpha team on your six, just around the corner.
interesting name.
you are going to serve your country.
welcome to division.
someone order up a cruel irony?
so, the national mall reactor.
you never could resist cheap symbolism.
parting shot at the prez.
I'm afraid you'll never find roan in there.
Alex and sean are tracking him right now.
the princess and the seal?
there's a circus act if ever there was one.
it's too late, Nikita.
after tonight, no one will be able to touch me.
what is that supposed to mean?
it means I'm done with division.
I'm moving on.
but you?
everything in your life, anything with any meaning, came from inside these walls.
you'll never be able to let go of this place.
has he swiped the stolen i. d. Through any checkpoints?
not yet. - How about the facility?
there can't be that many places for him to inject the plutonium.
actually, there can.
the cooling system has multiple access points throughout the compound.
fantastic.
Oh, and guns and nuclear reactors don't play well together.
just saying.
okay, I think we should split up.
you go that way.
I'll take this way. Better chances of finding Roan.
okay.
Hey, I didn't meant to put you on the spot before.
Oh, it's okay.
I justI get nervous in the field.
about you.
I can take care of myself.
so is that a no?
you still haven't asked me yet.
Birkhoff, what's the update on roan?
you'll never find him. - Shut up.
unfortunately, I think he's right.
we got Alex on site, but we're talking serious maze.
maybe Percy was lying about the n. m.r.
Yeah, he's lied about everything else.
drop it! Drop it now.
you don't want to be doing this.
please.
trust me. I hate him too.
I'm in a hurry.
commander, this is red team.
go ahead.
we got two tangos near the barn, sir.
one of them says he's surrendering.
copy that. Escort them to my position on the double.
that's far enough!
it's over, Percy.
you got what you wanted. Call off the meltdown.
well, I guess this is goodbye.
one last thing, though.
I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.
down the hatch.
help me up.
I'm done helping you.
if I die, roan gets the signal.
Birkhoff, there's gonna be a signal from the division silo in about five seconds.

this is no longer your mission.
advance team, what's your status?

advance team, come in!
listen to me.
division's back is up against the wall.
they will fight to the death.
if you pursue this course, I am telling you, all you're doing is upping the body count on both sides.
what course would you have me pursue?
right now, they are in a command crisis.
their master is dead.
they're looking for orders.
let me go down there.
you? You're their enemy.
division agents only respect what they've been made to fear.
they've been made to fear me.
my fight was never with you.
it was with Percy. You know this.
I've spoken to the vice president.
told her that I could negotiate the peaceful surrender of all personnel.
she believed me.
but I think you all know better than that.
don't you?
the second you put down your guns, they'll gun you down, because legally, division doesn't exist.
that's gonna change today.
and they're just gonna have to deal with it.
you are not invisible.
you exist.
and if they want to get to you, they're gonna have to go through me first.
let's talk.
immunity, identity, absolution.
never gonna happen. But I can promise no custody, no extreme rendition.
rendition? How do you think we got here?
the government told us they were giving us a second chance, but they never gave us a choice.
the oval office is never gonna give everyone in this facility a golden parachute.
the problem is a lot bigger than this facility.
division field agents all over the world have heard about this breach.
they're not gonna come in from the cold, Ryan.
they'll go rogue.
I know.
that's why I told the vice president the ideal unit to control the fallout from division is division itself.
keep division running?
until we can clean up the mess it's made.
there are still monsters out there.

I heard Percy tell the president he was just a messenger, probably for whoever is on the other side of his surrender.
we need to find out who that person is.
so division is going to run itself.
no.
they want me to run it.
I'm not gonna do it without you.
this isn't going to work.
it's the only way it works.
Nikita, you can trust me.
this isn't what we've been fight for.
I thougt you fight for justice.
is that what you call this?
this is the best thing we can do.
I was saving lives, lives that the system was gonna throw away.
are you telling me you think there's a good side of division?
no.
not unless you're running it one day.
or you.
when they gave you the ability to kill, they also gave you the ability to protect.
they want an answer.
what's it gonna be?
division is in good hands with Ryan, Nikita.
we can go.
where?
home.
remember? You did say that.
I said it.
but I don't know what a home is, michael.
I've never had one.
all I know is...

I learned right from wrong here, and I fell in love here.

you see, I could've assisted you in the planning phase.
that's my thing.
are you seriously miffed that I didn't check with you first? - No.
I'm mildly miffed you didn't check-in with me afterward.
see I had to find out when I was deleting evidence files from the Hong Kong police.
see, Engagement ring among the line items.
we're not going to Ops? - No.
see, this is what I'm talking about, man. You keep blindsiding me.
he trained a lot of the agents here, right?
I figured there may be conflicted loyalties.
Yeah, I wouldn't worry about that.
everybody pretty much hated his guts.
he was, like, the drill sergeant from hell.
Yeah, I see Percy had him reassigned in '02.
no, not reassigned, replaced.
Wade was Division's top trainer.
every recruit under him had an almost perfect record of killing high profile targets.
so what happened? - Like I said, almost perfect.
one of the recruits failed to complete his first kill mission, so Wade beat him to death with his bare hands.
Yeah.
Percy was like,"I do the canceling around here, thank you very much."
he shipped the psycho out into the field, and replaced him with a sleeker, broodier model of trainer.
well, the psycho lifted a prototype explosive from Fort Granville last night.
I think he's planning an attack.
RDX-- experimental shape charge.
not ready for field use because its polymer bonds degrade in 48 hours.
up till then, it's a lethal explosive.
so he has only 48 hours to use 'em?
36 now.
and we have no clue where.
all we know is where Percy reassigned him
Boston. Cover was a travel agent.
who even uses those anymore?
honeymooners.
honeymoon packages, excellent.
let me just get your info for our file.
Kenny and Jenny Braxton. We should already be on file.
we spoke to someone before. Who was that, honey?
ward? Wade?
Oh, Wade.
Yeah, unfortunately he left the company last month.
but I can pick up right where he left off.
maybe our file is still on his computer?
when he left, he erased his whole hard drive.
if he ever comes back in here, I am gonna give him a piece of my mind, believe me.
that's too bad.
okay, so plan "B," copy machine.
do you have a restroom here?
Yeah, at the back there.
great. Thank you.
ImagdeDay 6600 Color Pritner/Copier User Guide
I'm at the copier. Imageday 6600.
so on the main screen, hit menu, then load tray table.
when it pops out, lift it up and pull lever "C," should be the green lever.
take a look at this.
okay, then what?
then go ahead and get engaged without telling me about it.
Birkhoff, I didn't know Ryan was gonna tell Sonya first.
I didn't even know that Michael told Ryan.
now imagine all my frustration at being the last to find out, and use that to pull the lever.
she goes, like, once a year.
Really? - It's stunning, yeah.
hard drive.
you're a genius, Birkhoff, a true genius.
it's gonna take a lot more kissing up than that.
payment authorizations.
do you recognize any names?
Yeah, every Ruth and Gladys in America that never heard of Orbitz.
fail, Wade, fail.
teach all the Krav Maga you want, in my class, we learn copy machines have hard drives.
he must've used this credit card to make a reservation somewhere.
better.
online purchase links to an address in Lexington, Massachusetts.
say hi for me.
might wanna take a look at this.
looks like some kinda weird training area.
No!
it's okay. It's okay.
we're not gonna hurt you.
what's your name?
Where's Wade?
I know who you are.
you're Division.
he prepared me for this day.
and if you don't let me go, he's gonna kill you all.
have you gotten her to talk?
not a word.
so what do you think?
doc says no sign of sexual abuse.
physically, she's in good health.
and mentally?
a severe case of dissociation, separation from her true emotional self.
it's one way of coping.
she had to be walled off to survive in there.
could take months to recover.
well, we've got less than 28 hours to find out what she knows.
any lead on her identity?
her name's Liza Abbott.
she was kidnapped walking home from school two years ago.
we have to get her home.
she's got a point.
wait, hold on.
we need to track down Wade and the RDX.
right now, Liza is our only lead.
her parents have been in the dark for two years.
look, we will get her home safely after we find out what she knows about Wade.
I promise.
okay, I'll talk to her.
we've got some common ground taken against her will, kept underground, forced to train
she wasn't his captive, she was his recruit.
Hi, Liza.
I'm Nikita.
look, we gotta talk.
this is a safe place.
you can tell me anything you want, anything at all and I'll listen.
you hungry?
no.
I heard you say the word "Division."
does that mean anything to you?
because that's where we are right now, you know.
I know everything about this place.
let's talk about your place, the place I found you.
how long has Wade been keeping you in his basement?
you don't have to be afraid of him.
he can't get to you in here.
okay.
you're right.
he does know this place very well.
Wade was held captive here for years.
this is the place that scares him.
nothing scares him.
Liza, is it cool if I call you Liza?
I don't know who that is.
your name is Liza Abbott.
your parents are Elaine and Paul.
you live at 412 Orangewood Drive.
and your favorite sport is gymnastics.
mine is too.
I was just never any good at it.
Liza, you never have to see the place he made you live, not ever again.
it's not a place.
it's my home.
Mikey. Anything?
hand drawn blueprints, with what looks like notes made by a kid, sending your way.
he had map of this building.
these are plans for a commercial building.
look at the structural supports.
maybe we should consult an actual engineer first.
maybe you should use your actual eyes.
excuse me? - All right, settle down.
and just try and run a match.
incoming phone.
where is she? Where's Sarah?
well, I don't know who Sarah is, but Liza Abbott is safe.
her name is Sarah.
and if you know what's best for you, you'll return her to me.
she's at Division, and you're welcome to come join.
listen, everything you did under Percy's orders will be pardoned, but you need to stand down and come in.
listen to you-- tough guy voice.
it's a wonder you managed to train anyone at all.
it's pathetic.
I didn't lose your job for you, Wade.
you did that.
you wanna know what pathetic is?
pathetic is kidnapping a 12-year-old girl to make up for the recruits you no longer have to order around.
I'm gonna give you one order, and one chance to follow it-- release Sarah.
we'll release Liza to her parents once we know she's safe.
it's not her safety you need to worry about.
mobile three, cut him off!
inbound. Two minutes.
you know what?
I hate answering questions too.
so, I'll make ya a deal.
you can ask me anything you want, and I'll answer.
how about that?
can I leave?
Yeah.
but as soon as you tell me about Wade.
Why?
we need to know what he's planning.
we think he's gonna hurt other people.
Liza, listen to me.
this is gonna help you get back to your family.
what family?
what's the first rule recruits are taught when they graduate?
don't phone home.
right.
contact anyone from your old life, you will be killed and so will they.
what if Wade taught that rule to Liza?
maybe she's afraid he'll kill her parents, and that's why she won't talk.
Sonya, dispatch a survey team to the Abbotts' house in Nyack.
they may need protection. - Thank you.
I'm glad you're on board, because you're headed there too.
for protection?
they may know something that can help us break through to Liza.
but they can't know what's going on yet.
got you covered.
agent Pierson
Pierce, ma'am. Special Agent Pierce.
I'm sorry.
I don't recognize this man.
how is he connected?
he may not be.
it's just a possible lead, but one we have to follow.
Mr. Abbott.
no.
please, sir, if you could just take the time.
take my time?
Yes. There's no rush, but it really
let me tell you about time.
they say it heals all wounds, and it's true.
it works very slowly, but it works.
and the pain gets less and less.
and then one day, you see a face, hear a voice, and you think it's her.
and the hole in your heart gets ripped open all over again
just like when you hear about another "possible lead."
please don't feel
he's just
paul needs to move forward.
and he wants us both to, but I can't.
that's why I wear this.
it's beautiful.
we got matching ones when we went to Santa Fe one summer.
mine's the mom, Liza's the daughter.
I never take it off.
you know, you look just like that Russian heiress who was in the news.
she disappeared years ago, and then she popped back out of nowhere
I, don't believe I read that story.
see, I follow every story just like that one.
because sometimes they do come back, even when everyone else has given up.
see, I know in my heart that I'm going to see Liza again.
I know it.
keep believing that, Mrs. Abbott.
don't ever stop.
Liza was keeping this in her room, in a very good, hidden spot.
how'd you find it?
luck.
anyway, I thought you could use it to help her.
so, figure out what building this is?
too many cities, too little time.
the RDX is only lethal for the next 11 hours.
great, so the only thing we go going for us is Wade really wants Liza back.
he's not getting her. - Exactly.
I think she's key to his attack.
it's not just an attack, it's a test--for her.
look at these numbers.
these are times added up.
they're drills.
what kind a test?
the only one Wade knows.
it's a kill mission.
Liza's graduation.
or Sarah's, as he kept calling her.
that's a common tactic in training child soldiers.
new names severs kids from their real selves, makes 'em more malleable.
she kept this hidden in her room all this time.
the kid's stronger than he knows.
can you clear the south corridor for me?
I lived underground too.
they only let me out for two things
eating and training.
this was my nightmare.
but I managed to turn it into my little corner of the world.
who kept you here?
a man who ran this place like a prison, but I fought back.
Percy?
Oh, right.
I forgot you know everything about this place.
Hey, you wanna see something that no one else knows?
I've only shown this to one other girl.
there's a slit back here, just deep enough to fit a key card in it.
right there.
so I hid one here.
I stole it from a guard.
so every night, I would sneak out.
I'd wander around this place and I'd memorize it.
then I'd let myself back in.
then I'd map it all out.
what?
you wanna ask me something, don't you?
good. I told you you could ask me anything.
what happened to him?
to Percy?
I dropped him down a 300-foot shaft.
I think we all hold onto something that gives us hope.
Liza, Wade didn't find it, we did.
he has no idea you've been fighting back all this time.
the interpreter of my past.
the inspiration of our future.
the interpreter of my past.
the inspiration of our future.
the interpreter of my past.
the inspiration of our future.
Liza, honey. He can't hurt you or your family.
Liza, you don't have to be Sarah anymore. Okay?
you don't have to be Sarah anymore.
you can really stop him?
Oh, I'm going to stop him as soon as you tell me what he's planning.
he's going to New York.
he's going to Hotel Normandy.
we've got a perimeter alert!
security ALART - What? - Outside the barn.
it's Wade.
I told him she was here.
he's knockin' on the wrong door.
get responders at the surface and take him out.
I'll find out what's going on.
you're needed in operations immediately.
he's coming for me, I told you!
Hey, look at me, look at me. Read my eyes.
it's one man against all of us.
we are trained fighters.
there's no way he's getting past Division or me.
you don't understand.
I need you to stay with her.
please don't leave me.
I'll be right back.
be right back.
they can't actually expect to win.
failure's not an option for this guy.
well, it's about to become one.
is it him? - Yes.
Wade is attacking Division.
Where's Michael?
taking mobile one and two, armed and armored.
everyone else is securing internal.
just stay calm, okay?
I don't wanna be by myself.
I'm right here if you need anything.
but I'm scared.
it's okay.
everything will be fine
no. Liza!
how did you exfil?
through the auto bay.
now you see why I had you study all those maps of Division.
Yes, sir.
what does chance favor?
chance favors the prepared mind.
who interrogated you?
someone named Nikita.
did she torture you?
no.
maybe it really is a new Division.
what?
let me see your teeth.
I wasn't sure that they'd pass on that I'd called you Sarah.
I heard the name, that's when I knew to make my move.
as we drilled.
you're Jessica now.
Yes, sir.
and what does Jessica do?
she completes the mission.
I'm sorry
we still have time.
and you did well today.
you'll do better tomorrow.
matching FLOOR PLAN MATCHING FAILED
no match on the Hotel Normandy?
not from any angle.
square peg, round hole.
she lied, just like she was trained.
I thought I was getting through to her.
Hey, you were. I watched you in medical.
she said five sentences.
when you helped me get clean,
I never let you know it was working, but it was.
I was just too afraid to show it.
what else did she say?
she said that, Wade was the interpreter of her past, and that she was the inspiration of the future, something like that.
the interpreter of our past, glory of our present, inspiration of our future.
it's the Pakistani national anthem.
bring up Wade's file.
who was the target he failed to kill?
who, Wade? - No, the recruit
the recruit that Wade beat to death.
who's the target he failed to kill?
Oh, it was some low-level politico from Pakistan.
he was mixed up in opium.
saeed Tamir, former minister of defense.
pakistani ambassador to the U.S.
she was sending a message under duress.
she was trying to help.
run a locate on Saeed.
match plans to the Pakistani consulate.
there's a NATO summit in New York this weekend.
Tamir's scheduled to attend.
as for tonight, he's giving a speech at an east-west youth summit at the Pakistani consulate.
blueprints are a match.
this is all about correcting one failed mission, proving that he had a perfect record.
Wade's lost his mind.
Yeah, I think we've pretty much covered that.
alert the State Department.
they'll cancel the function. Slight problem.
the youth summit's televised.
it's already under way.
all right, people, let's move.
we have two targets.
Nikita, I'll see you up top.
send everything to my office.
why are there two targets on the board?
look, she assaulted an agent.
Wade is the target. Liza is the victim.
it's not that simple. - Yes, it is.
change the target back.
I am doing this to protect you.
and I won't take chances where that's concerned.
help me get there.
we have a new lead on a suspect.
is it the man in the picture?
Elaine, it's very important that you understand this is only a lead.
we will do anything we can to help, anything.
there's something that you've already done.
that's why I'm here.
I don't understand.
I looked up that case you were talking about
Alexandra Udinov.
did you know that she carried her father's watch around with her?
I think I remember reading that.
evidently, she looked at it every day as a reminder of who she really was.
if she carried anything special, it would be her Indian girl.
can I borrow yours?
it could help.
of course.
I'll return it, I promise.
don't worry about that.
just find Liza.
this is her mom's-- matching set.
nice one, Alex.
now I just gotta get in there.
any line on Wade?
Michael's checking the perimeter.
why don't you go join him? - Copy.
okay, Niki, you take the first hallway on the left.
I used to monitor my recruits' missions from a van.
Wade could be anywhere.
I'm picking up an encrypted wireless frequency nearby.
it's an ad-hoc network.
tell me it's close.
you're right underneath it.
Madison building, 10th floor.
can't get more specific.
Liza, I know you're in here.
yeah?
the marked points on these plans, they're not just random stars.
they're vents.
she's in the ducts.
ladies and gentlemen, I can think of no better way to kick off a NATO conference than with an east meets west youth summit.
our youth is our future, and in turn the inspiration for our international policy making.
65 countries are represented in New York this weekend.
but in their youth, we have unlimited global possibilities.
four minutes.
weapon armed and set.
begin egress.
the vents are the only unguarded entrance to the basement.
just below the lobby where Tamir's standing.
he's standing on a bomb.
so, what I say to you today is this:
the ground has shifted right before us.
I'm in the basement.
security's tight on the outside.
change of plans, detonate now.
detonate now, and escape the chaos.
remember, chance favors the prepared.
Birkhoff, servo-rifle!
same model.
on it, I'm on it.
hey there, Michael!
just in time to see how it's done for real.
I'll get you right after, I promise.
easy.
Nikita. Nikita's here.
what?
Detonate!
Liza, honey, this isn't you.
you can change your mind right now and you won't get in trouble, I promise.
Where'd you get that?
your mom gave it to me.
she kept hers all these years.
do you still have yours?
she told me to tell you that she loves you, and she's still waiting for you.
what is the delay?
Birkhoff! - Hang on. Hang on.
I'm downloading my sweetness to your mobile now.
okay.
get it close to the servo, within ten feet.
that's easier said than done.
connecting
I am Wade's servo-gun.
I now betray my overlord.
exterminate.
Exterminate!
so, one whose future depends on our mutual progress.
your name is Liza Abbott.
your parents are Elaine and Paul.
you live at 412 Orangewood Drive.
and you're really good at gymnastics.
your mom says, "please come home."
detonate now, or you will know what pain truly is.
who's Nikita?
my recruit.
it's okay, honey.
we're gonna get you home, okay?
we're gonna get you home.
Transpo's ready.
I thought you might wanna see this one through.
Yeah.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
one question, though.
what's that?
the Indian girl necklace.
she hid it for two years.
Wade never found it, but you did.
recruits seem to think their rooms hide behind an invisible force field.
you searched my room?
do you remember Percy's routine inspections?
Yeah.
I always passed them.
Yeah, that's because I was the one who found your key card.
the crack in this wall wasn't as hidden as you thought.
and you never ratted me out?
I always had your back.
look familiar?
can I
can I go over the cover story again?
of course, if you want.
okay, so Wade took me coming home from school.
he locked me in his basement and told me I was his new daughter.
he didn't hurt me, but he never let me go.
yesterday, I heard a gunshot from upstairs.
after I was brave enough to look, he was lying dead on the kitchen floor.
he shot himself.
so I picked up his phone and dialed 911.
and you've never heard of the Pakistani consulate.
or Division.
what's Division?
I'd probably make a really good agent one day?
Hello? Just kidding.
but seriously though.
I'm probably one of the youngest girls you've ever saved, right?
there was one other girl.
Liza, honey.
Alex is gonna walk you up to the house now, okay?
me? Don't you wanna-- - No.
I got the last girl.
I want you to have this one.
get her home.
come on.
CK-2402 PRISON, RUSSIA
do it.
I can't.
orders?
operation skeleton key.
skeleton key?
that was a long time ago.
you're looking for the device.
let me out, and I'll tell you where it is.
sir?
yes?
four hours.
Yes.
Oh, no, thank you.
thank you.
I would like to make a toast.
long overdue, for which I apologize.
well, we've all been a little busy.
still rogue agents shouldn't keep us from properly celebrating your engagement.
the night's young.
don't jinx it.
to michael and Nikita.
meant to be.
it's been a long road and hardfought...
but it's got to get easier from here, right?
where do I start?
and I hope you know i'd do anything for you.
you mean more than taking a bullet?
it's okay. I've taken a shot for Alex before.
actually she shot you.
in the kevlar.
to save her life.
few things say I love you like a bullet to a nonessential area.
well, then, honey, why haven't you shot me yet?
keep talking.
and your toast.
to us.
we can survive each other, we can survive anything.
Cheers. - Cheers.
Cheers.
Birkhoff wants us in now.
he's just upset because we're off shift and he's not.
don't worry. We got it.
what was that?
we don't need to get into this now.
get into what?
something you're not ready to hear.
what?
you need to leave division.
I know you think you owe Nikita something.
you're right.
I don't want to hear it.
so, listen, I've been I've been thinking about the way we left things.
maybe we should have dinner, you know?
I appreciate the offer, but I think we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
we've finally reached a place where we can peacefully coexist at work, and I don't want to complicate that.
another dirty 30?
not exactly.
Oh, my god.
I know you and I have more in common than you think, Owen.
division took everything from me too.
if you ever need anything...
I'll be around.
okay?
he's alive.
he dropped off the face of the earth six months ago.
how'd you find him?
evening news.
according to reports, Owen elliot tried to rob a bank in montreal.
same bank where he stopped a robbery two years ago.
nothing was stolen, and he was long gone by the time the cops got there.
it wasn't a robbery.
he's sending me a message.
how do you know it isn't a trap?
Owen wouldn't do that.
why not pick up a phone and call?
he wouldn't know where to call.
last he knew we were in the beach house, and that's long gone.
that's why he's back on the grid.
he wants me to find him.
I know where he's headed next.
take a team. - A team?
Ryan, we've been looking for Owen for six months.
he's not some rogue agent who just refuses to come in.
he probably doesn't even know what's happened here.
and we don't know what's happened to him.
an abandoned school?
after Owen fled that bank two years ago, he went to ground. This is where I tracked him.
don't worry. They know the drill.
nonlethal only.
Yeah, what about you?
I'll try not to shoot him.
where is she? Where's Nikita?
where is she?
No! Owen, Owen, Owen, I'm here.
I'm here. It's okay. Let him go.
he's not a threat. They're with us.
they're with you?
they're division!
Yeah, and so are we.
I know. It's crazy.
but it's a long story.
Percy's dead.
Amanda's gone rogue.
Owen, no one is gonna hurt you, but you have to let him go.
things are different now.
Michael! - What?
I didn't shoot him.
this is ridiculous.
Owen already told us after he got taken by gogol that he was thrown into a russian prison.
we have no evidence to back up his story.
let's just interrogate him and make sure this isn't some ploy.
say what you want about the guy, but Owen isn't exactly a criminal mastermind.
Gogol probably bribed some prison official to keep him off the books, and that's why we couldn't find him.
then there's nothing to worry about.
we verify that he is telling the truth, - and that's the end of it. - Fine.
I'll talk to him.
Nikita, you're too close to this.
okay, we need someone impartial, someone he doesn't know.
Hello, Owen.
I'm Alex. - So you're Alex.
last time I saw Nikita, you guys were on the outs.
so, what, you kiss and make up?
there wasn't any kissing, but yes.
now it's your turn to talk.
you told Nikita you were in a russian prison.
how did you get out?
one of your division cleaners broke me out.
Exdivision.
now rogue.
you knew anne.
were you two friends?
Anne doesn't have friends.
if you and anne weren't friends, why would she help you?
she wanted information on an old mission.
which mission?
operation skeleton key.
NSA had some genius dude in their basement developing unbreakable encryption algorithms.
the thing is, this guy wasn't just designing 'em, he was also figuring out how to crack 'em.
let me guess. Percy found out and, while it's not technically treason, it was close enough for him to blackmail genius dude.
Owen faked the guy's death, and Percy turned him into his pet engineer.
the engineer.
the designer of the black boxes.
before Percy snapped his neck right in front of me.
what's this device that anne was after?
cryptograph.
master key.
access to any system in the world.
any system?
FBI, cia, nsa?
division.
probably why the device was stored offsite for safekeeping.
only three people knew where Percy, the engineer...
and Owen.
and Owen's the only one left.
you've been busy.
Percy, amanda, ari.
checked a lot off your todo list while I was gone.
I got a hair cut too.
you skipped over one thing
shut down division.
what the hell are you doing here?
I'm helping people like us who deserve a second chance.
seems more like you're hunting down and killing people like us.
not killing. Bringing in.
how many you brought in so far?
we are saving lives, okay?
there was a couple of cia assets.
there was a young girl who was kidnapped.
we got her back to her family.
how many rogue agents have you found?
three, but - And how many did you bring in alive?
so when you say things are different, what you really meant is nothing's changed.
look, I've had my doubts like you, but we're still trying to find our feet.
it's only been a couple of months.
is that how long it takes to get numb?
actions have consequences, Nikita.
you told me that.
are you thinking about all the consequences?
we're prepped for retrieval.
we just need to know where to go.
you remember how I told you the engineer's a little bit weird?
the engineer kept his supersecret decoder ring in a cemetery?
he was paranoid.
he hated that Percy kept the black boxes in banks 'cause banks always get robbed.
looks a lot different now.
I guess they got a lot of new dead people.
well, why don't we split up?
what are we looking for? - Anthony george.
it's a flat marker.
Anthony GEORGE 1834-1880
got it!
what is this? Armed grave robbers?
taking fire! We need backup!
Michael, cover me.
I'm going to find Owen.
Mikey, your backup's on the scene.

what, does anne have a freakin' army now?
Anne's just a soldier.
it's amanda's army.
how exactly did amanda build an army without us knowing?
we knew she was recruiting.
well, that explains anne, but not the other wellarmed mercenaries.
I think some of them are exgogol, just like ari tasarov.
I think they might still be together.
lovely. Well, at least exgogol agents have real identities that we can track.
one of the gunmen from the cemetery survived.
he's in medical. We'll start with him.
what?
I can't figure out why anne tried to grab Owen again.
she had the drop on him. She could have taken him out and split with the cryptograph.
maybe she wanted Owen for something else.
she takes orders from amanda.
so the question is, what does amanda want with Owen?
relax.
no one's going to hurt you.
is this another hospital?
something like that.
what is that? What are you doing?
I'm going to help you.
what are you doing down here?
looking for answers.
I thought if I could remember what amanda did to me back then, maybe I'd know what she wants with me now.
we'll find out what amanda's up to.
we've got one of her guys.
when he wakes up, we're gonna get started on him.
I never told you everything about me.
I never told you about my life before division.
well, I know youyou never liked to talk about it.
cause I can't remember it.
any of it.
my life before division is...
is a blank.
that's impossible. You have to remember something.
I used to think it was a side effect from the drugs they put me on.
I mean, the regimen screwed with everything else.
why not my memories too?
all this time why didn't you tell me?
because there was so much going on.
the black boxes, Percy, the guardians.
I figured i'd have plenty of time - to work it out later. - Yeah.
then you ended up in prison with nothing but time.
that's when I realized, every time I try to remember my life before division,
I get these These headaches, you know.
worse than anything.
they erased your whole life.
she erased my life.
Amanda did this to me, and I want to know why.
why don't you help me find her?
we'll ask her in person.

she should be opening it soon.
I don't know why he's unconscious.
there's no sign of head trauma, though I am seeing some fluid buildup near the lungs.

Hello, division.
you must all be wondering how such a terrible accident could have happened in this place where you've always been safe.
well, let me assure you.
this was no accident, and you no longer have a safe place.
Nikita murdered Percy and forced me out.
she killed your friends and comrades, and now you follow her because she told you a story.
you got anything? - We're completely shut out.
if you played along like good little boys and girls, the government would forgive all your sins.
how the hell is she doing this?
it's her shiny new cryptograph.

but for those of you that stay...
I will hunt you, I will find you, and you will pay with your life.

that's why you went into the field.
you wanted to make sure that your human bioweapon would end up on Nikita's doorstep.
some things can't be delegated.
how did you know they wouldn't kill him?
they trained the medical staff on how to handle injured prisoners and prep them for interrogation.
besides, he was too valuable.
I should have been consulted.
I'm tired of waiting.
it's time to act.
well, congratulations.
in one step you've managed to unite Nikita and all of division against us.
you really think they're gathering up torches and pitchforks?
Ari, they're rats scrambling for a way off a sinking ship.
you're not thinking clearly.
you're letting your anger towards Nikita
I am perfectly clear.
I gave Nikita everything.
that little street urchin with the bad eyebrows, she wasn't a leader.
she was worthless.
I created the Nikita people fear and respect.
then she used the gifts I gave her against me.
I'm ready to return the favor.
Amanda lies. We all know that.
I made a promise to each and every one of you, and I intend to keep it, no matter what.
so let's get back to work. Let's find her.
let's get the other bodies out of the building.
I don't want to take any more chances.
I have something.
we may be able to use amanda's signal to track her.
she thinks she can taunt us.
looks like she overplayed her hand.
Sean?
what are you doing here?
well, you're not returning my calls.
and then I heard that amanda set off a bomb inside division, so, you know, I figured i'd stop by and see if you were still alive.
I'm fine.
I wasn't anywhere near medical when it happened.
look around.
as long as you're here, you're in danger.
you got shot last week, and you could have been killed today.
but I wasn't.
I know you want to protect me, but I made a promise to Nikita.
come here.
I made a promise to my mother, and she ended up dead.
you did everything you could.
when she told me about division,
I could have told her to shut this place down, resign from office, and run like hell.
we are shutting division down.
but it's gonna take some time. And, once we clean things up
when I came here, it was a temporary post.
supervise the cleanup. That's what she said.
but no matter what I did the mess just kept getting bigge and a year later she's gone, this place is standing, and you are still standing in it.
now I can't tell you what to do, Alex, but I'm not gonna stand by and watch this place destroy another person that I love.
what?
I love you.
but, if that's not enough of a reason for you to leave, then I got no reason to stay.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
please tell me we're going amandahunting.

Birkhoff, guide me to Owen's tracker.
I need to get you to safety.

Owen's not here.
I'm looking at the screen right now.
you should be standing on top of him.
wait a minute. You are on top of him.

turn around slowly.
I want to know what you did to me.
why'd you screw with my head?
your brain was screwedup way before I got to it.
you were a broken soldier they had to keep locked away.
I fixed you.
keep him still.
everything is going to be all right, Owen.
we'll fix this.
you don't look well.
tell me, are the headaches back?
Hey, you okay?
I got the cryptothingy.
great. Let's go.
come on.
I should shoot you.
Oh, but you need me.
you want answers, and I have them.
damn it. Tell me what you did.
where do you want me to start, Owen?
or should I call you sam?
that's what your friends used to call you before you killed them all.
isn't that right, sam?
maybe you should give this to me.
we don't want you to hurt anyone else.
Anne, shoot Mr. Elliot.
no. He comes with us.
I didn't go to all this trouble just to have you kill him.
all this trouble?
I can't get in the room. It's a steel door.
what room? I'm looking at the plans right now.
there is no room.
it's new.
what's Owen's position?
he's at your two, four meters in.
this was never about the cryptograph.
you knew where it was the whole time.
you wanted Owen.
you would never have agreed to break him out if you didn't think he had something to offer.
now he offers a distraction.
Owen's hurt! I need help!
Amanda's, she getting away.
Oh, she said she knows!
now It's okay. We'll get her.
don't you worry.
I need help!
Hey, you've reached sean pierce.
I'm not here to take your call, so leave a message.
you're still a terrible patient.
you're supposed to be laying down, you know.
Yeah, if you want your patients to stick around, you should probably get a tv in here or something.
somebody's head is better.
you're making complete sentences again.
I'm still a little fuzzy.
I don't know what she did to me, but she must have shortcircuited my brain or something.
you know, after emily died,
I got up every morning thinking that today would be the day that I'd finally put an end to Percy.
you know?
that's what drove me.
now he's gone, and the whole world has changed.
I'm not really sure what's next.
hell, I'm not even really sure who I am.
you know who you are.
you're our first success.
you're the first rogue agent we've brought in...
alive. - Yeah.
finally get to chalk one up in the win column?
Yeah, well, I think it just means that we might...
be getting the hang of it.
you know, it only counts if I stay.
my schedule is pretty clear.
I guess I could stick around.
I don't know about you, but I'm starving.
you're sta...
Oh, you want to...
I would love to, but I'm right in the middle of...
what?
what is all this?
I kept thinking about amanda's prophecy of doom.
so she used the cryptograph to get into our system, but how did she know when to do it?
maybe she knew when the gas had been released, like it was some sort of trigger for the video.
I thought of that.
she didn't access our system until an hour after the attack.
for her to know that, she would have had to have someone on the inside.
I couldn't think of another explanation.
show me what you've done so far.
thought you were hungry.
we'll order in.
you can pay.
we'd have to kill the delivery man.
true.
since we blew up amanda's safe house, she and ari are back on the run.
it's not a total win, but it's a start.
Owen's staying. It's a win.
I took a look at the room you found Owen in.
and something caught my eye.
we don't know what the chair does, but birkhoff recognized this.
it's used for brain surgery.
Amanda tried to lobotomize him with it.
you think she was gonna use that on Owen?
she already did something to him.
Owen's tests showed scarring in his brain.
it's not recent, and it's not due to an injury.
they're surgical scars.
that's what caused his memory loss.
most likely. Amanda won't stop.
she is angry, and her rage is focused on you.
I can handle amanda.
in the last 48 hours, she has ambushed us, tried to kidnap Owen, and set off a bioweapon within these walls.
that is one hell of an opening move.
then we figure out what she's gonna do next.
antwerp, BELGIUM
I have a task for you, anne.
Owen?
Oh, that ship has sailed.
Nikita knows I wanted Owen for something.
she'll be too suspicious for my original plan to work, but I have an even better idea now.
why not just kill Nikita?
I could have done it in the cemetery if you'd allowed it.
death is the last step of her journey, and we're not there yet.
her journey?
Oh, I'm not done teaching her, anne.
I am not done teaching her.

Oh, no, thank you.
thank you.
I would like to make a toast.
long overdue, for which I apologize.
well, we've all been a little busy.
still rogue agents shouldn't keep us from properly celebrating your engagement.
the night's young.
don't jinx it.
to michael and Nikita.
meant to be.
it's been a long road and hardfought...
but it's got to get easier from here, right?
where do I start?
and I hope you know i'd do anything for you.
you mean more than taking a bullet?
it's okay. I've taken a shot for Alex before.
actually she shot you.
in the kevlar.
to save her life.
few things say I love you like a bullet to a nonessential area.
well, then, honey, why haven't you shot me yet?
keep talking.
and your toast.
to us.
we can survive each other, we can survive anything.
Cheers. - Cheers.
Cheers.
Birkhoff wants us in now.
he's just upset because we're off shift and he's not.
don't worry. We got it.
what was that?
we don't need to get into this now.
get into what?
something you're not ready to hear.
what?
you need to leave division.
I know you think you owe Nikita something.
you're right.
so, listen, I've been I've been thinking about the way we left things.
maybe we should have dinner, you know?
I appreciate the offer, but I think we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
we've finally reached a place where we can peacefully coexist at work, and I don't want to complicate that.
another dirty 30?
not exactly.
Oh, my god.
I know you and I have more in common than you think, Owen.
division took everything from me too.
if you ever need anything...
I'll be around.
okay?
he's alive.
he dropped off the face of the earth six months ago.
how'd you find him?
evening news.
according to reports, Owen elliot tried to rob a bank in montreal.
same bank where he stopped a robbery two years ago.
nothing was stolen, and he was long gone by the time the cops got there.
it wasn't a robbery.
he's sending me a message.
how do you know it isn't a trap?
Owen wouldn't do that.
why not pick up a phone and call?
he wouldn't know where to call.
last he knew we were in the beach house, and that's long gone.
that's why he's back on the grid.
he wants me to find him.
I know where he's headed next.
take a team. - A team?
Ryan, we've been looking for Owen for six months.
he's not some rogue agent who just refuses to come in.
he probably doesn't even know what's happened here.
and we don't know what's happened to him.
an abandoned school?
after Owen fled that bank two years ago, he went to ground. This is where I tracked him.
don't worry. They know the drill.
nonlethal only.
Yeah, what about you?
I'll try not to shoot him.
where is she? Where's Nikita?
where is she?
No! Owen, Owen, Owen, I'm here.
I'm here. It's okay. Let him go.
he's not a threat. They're with us.
they're with you?
they're division!
Yeah, and so are we.
I know. It's crazy.
but it's a long story.
Percy's dead.
Amanda's gone rogue.
Owen, no one is gonna hurt you, but you have to let him go.
things are different now.
Michael! - What?
I didn't shoot him.
this is ridiculous.
Owen already told us after he got taken by gogol that he was thrown into a russian prison.
we have no evidence to back up his story.
let's just interrogate him and make sure this isn't some ploy.
say what you want about the guy, but Owen isn't exactly a criminal mastermind.
Gogol probably bribed some prison official to keep him off the books, and that's why we couldn't find him.
then there's nothing to worry about.
we verify that he is telling the truth, - and that's the end of it. - Fine.
I'll talk to him.
Nikita, you're too close to this.
okay, we need someone impartial, someone he doesn't know.
Hello, Owen.
I'm Alex. - So you're Alex.
last time I saw Nikita, you guys were on the outs.
so, what, you kiss and make up?
there wasn't any kissing, but yes.
now it's your turn to talk.
you told Nikita you were in a russian prison.
how did you get out?
one of your division cleaners broke me out.
Exdivision.
now rogue.
you knew anne.
were you two friends?
Anne doesn't have friends.
if you and anne weren't friends, why would she help you?
she wanted information on an old mission.
which mission?
operation skeleton key.
NSA had some genius dude in their basement developing unbreakable encryption algorithms.
the thing is, this guy wasn't just designing 'em, he was also figuring out how to crack 'em.
let me guess. Percy found out and, while it's not technically treason, it was close enough for him to blackmail genius dude.
Owen faked the guy's death, and Percy turned him into his pet engineer.
the engineer.
the designer of the black boxes.
before Percy snapped his neck right in front of me.
what's this device that anne was after?
cryptograph.
master key.
access to any system in the world.
any system?
FBI, cia, nsa?
division.
probably why the device was stored offsite for safekeeping.
only three people knew where Percy, the engineer...
and Owen.
and Owen's the only one left.
you've been busy.
Percy, amanda, ari.
checked a lot off your todo list while I was gone.
I got a hair cut too.
you skipped over one thing
shut down division.
what the hell are you doing here?
I'm helping people like us who deserve a second chance.
seems more like you're hunting down and killing people like us.
not killing. Bringing in.
how many you brought in so far?
we are saving lives, okay?
there was a couple of cia assets.
there was a young girl who was kidnapped.
we got her back to her family.
how many rogue agents have you found?
three, but - And how many did you bring in alive?
so when you say things are different, what you really meant is nothing's changed.
look, I've had my doubts like you, but we're still trying to find our feet.
it's only been a couple of months.
is that how long it takes to get numb?
actions have consequences, Nikita.
you told me that.
are you thinking about all the consequences?
we're prepped for retrieval.
we just need to know where to go.
you remember how I told you the engineer's a little bit weird?
the engineer kept his supersecret decoder ring in a cemetery?
he was paranoid.
he hated that Percy kept the black boxes in banks 'cause banks always get robbed.
looks a lot different now.
I guess they got a lot of new dead people.
well, why don't we split up?
what are we looking for? - Anthony george.
it's a flat marker.
Anthony GEORGE 1834-1880
got it!
what is this? Armed grave robbers?

I got niki and Owen.
we're looking for amanda.
if you do see amanda, you might want to avoid eye contact.
maybe you won't turn to stone, but why risk it?
thanks for the tip, nerd.
our people are in position.
we're a go.
clear.
this is Alex. Heading for the cryptograph.
turn right and go across the hall.
eyes on amanda.
where?
Birkhoff, guide me to Owen's tracker.
I need to get you to safety.
kill them!
cover me!
go!
Owen's not here.
I'm looking at the screen right now.
you should be standing on top of him.
wait a minute. You are on top of him.
basement.
turn around slowly.
I want to know what you did to me.
why'd you screw with my head?
your brain was screwedup way before I got to it.
you were a broken soldier they had to keep locked away.
I fixed you.
keep him still.
everything is going to be all right, Owen.
we'll fix this.
you don't look well.
tell me, are the headaches back?
Hey, you okay?
I got the cryptothingy.
great. Let's go.
come on.
I should shoot you.
Oh, but you need me.
you want answers, and I have them.
damn it. Tell me what you did.
where do you want me to start, Owen?
or should I call you sam?
that's what your friends used to call you before you killed them all.
isn't that right, sam?
maybe you should give this to me.
we don't want you to hurt anyone else.
Anne, shoot Mr. Elliot.
no. He comes with us.
I didn't go to all this trouble just to have you kill him.
all this trouble?
I can't get in the room. It's a steel door.
what room? I'm looking at the plans right now.
there is no room.
it's new.
what's Owen's position?
he's at your two, four meters in.
this was never about the cryptograph.
you knew where it was the whole time.
you wanted Owen.
you would never have agreed to break him out if you didn't think he had something to offer.
now he offers a distraction.
Owen's hurt! I need help!
Amanda's, she getting away.
Oh, she said she knows!
now It's okay. We'll get her.
don't you worry.
I need help!
Hey, you've reached sean pierce.
I'm not here to take your call, so leave a message.
you're still a terrible patient.
you're supposed to be laying down, you know.
Yeah, if you want your patients to stick around, you should probably get a tv in here or something.
somebody's head is better.
you're making complete sentences again.
I'm still a little fuzzy.
I don't know what she did to me, but she must have shortcircuited my brain or something.
you know, after emily died,
I got up every morning thinking that today would be the day that I'd finally put an end to Percy.
you know?
that's what drove me.
now he's gone, and the whole world has changed.
I'm not really sure what's next.
hell, I'm not even really sure who I am.
you know who you are.
you're our first success.
you're the first rogue agent we've brought in...
alive. - Yeah.
finally get to chalk one up in the win column?
Yeah, well, I think it just means that we might...
be getting the hang of it.
you know, it only counts if I stay.
my schedule is pretty clear.
I guess I could stick around.
I don't know about you, but I'm starving.
you're sta...
Oh, you want to...
I would love to, but I'm right in the middle of...
what?
what is all this?
I kept thinking about amanda's prophecy of doom.
so she used the cryptograph to get into our system, but how did she know when to do it?
maybe she knew when the gas had been released, like it was some sort of trigger for the video.
I thought of that.
she didn't access our system until an hour after the attack.
for her to know that, she would have had to have someone on the inside.
I couldn't think of another explanation.
show me what you've done so far.
thought you were hungry.
we'll order in.
you can pay.
we'd have to kill the delivery man.
true.
since we blew up amanda's safe house, she and ari are back on the run.
it's not a total win, but it's a start.
Owen's staying. It's a win.
I took a look at the room you found Owen in.
and something caught my eye.
we don't know what the chair does, but birkhoff recognized this.
it's used for brain surgery.
Amanda tried to lobotomize him with it.
you think she was gonna use that on Owen?
she already did something to him.
Owen's tests showed scarring in his brain.
it's not recent, and it's not due to an injury.
they're surgical scars.
that's what caused his memory loss.
most likely. Amanda won't stop.
she is angry, and her rage is focused on you.
I can handle amanda.
in the last 48 hours, she has ambushed us, tried to kidnap Owen, and set off a bioweapon within these walls.
that is one hell of an opening move.
then we figure out what she's gonna do next.
antwerp, BELGIUM
I have a task for you, anne.
Owen?
Oh, that ship has sailed.
Nikita knows I wanted Owen for something.
she'll be too suspicious for my original plan to work, but I have an even better idea now.
why not just kill Nikita?
I could have done it in the cemetery if you'd allowed it.
death is the last step of her journey, and we're not there yet.
her journey?
Oh, I'm not done teaching her, anne.
I am not done teaching her.
I only need one of you.
did Nikita send you...
or Michael?
where is your hit team?
or is it their precision strike squad?
or does Division not believe in that kind of killing anymore?
I'd heard they'd gone soft
redemption, forgiveness.
whatever stooge the president put in charge has no clue what Division is about.
you want forgiveness?
sir, do you need help?
I forgive you.
they're ready for you, sir.
Yeah.
thousands gathered to celebrate the special election of Alexi Markov as President of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
his swift rise to power came on the heels of the sudden death of former President Zelensky last month.
this guy was Division?
to the world, he's Alexi Markov.
to us, Edward.
sent into deep cover six years ago to infiltrate the People's Liberty Movement
uzbekistan's main opposition party.
how the hell did he become-- - Master of his domain?
a little luck, a lot of cojones.
he carved out a role for himself as the party's enforcer.
he wormed his way up the ranks, then when the PLM rose to power last month, he found himself a heartbeat away.
he made sure that heart didn't beat very long.
one of the dirty thirty is the leader of a foreign country.
my God, this is a disaster.
we talked about these rogues being loose cannons.
this one's a loose nuke.
at least we know where he is. We head to Uzbekistan.
you and what army?
cause this guy literally has an army.
he already wiped out our advance team.
he's gonna be on high alert.
this can't be an away game.
he's got a White House state visit on the books for next week.
tricky. If a leader dies on American soil, whether real or if we fake it, it'll look suspicious.
that's why he's not going to die.
we take him and swap him with a double.
then we plot his death on our own timeline.
look, I have read the files.
I know Division's done this before.
Yeah, with carefully selected assets, months of vetting, and plastic surgery.
we don't have the time.
unless you ask the president to delay the meeting.
the President?
and what do I tell her when she asks why?
that she'd be helping us get one of our targets.
I'm not telling the president that a rogue Division Agent is currently running Uzbekistan.
now, we intercept Markov after he arrives in the states but before he gets to the White House.
I want conops and mission breakdown on my desk by close of play.
I'm just gonna say it.
there are lots of brands of decaf that are just as tasty as the real thing.
I say we make the switch.
I know. I'm sorry.
but this is a volatile situation.
we realize that.
we all know how high the stakes are.
you need to trust that we know what we're doing and we're not gonna let you down.
can you do that?
of course. - Okay.
but, I mean, based on how tightly wound you've been lately, I'm not so sure.
I'm not just talking about today.
Birkhoff and Sonya came to me with something.
looks like Amanda knew exactly when the attack on medical went down.
knew how?
the bad version -- somebody told her.
a mole.
well, I guess we shouldn't be surprised.
probably too much to hope that this was one big, happy ship.
the Titanic was a happy ship right until the end.
let me put Alex on it. She's experienced with this.
right.
it takes a mole to catch a mole.
you sure that's all?
the Markov situation isn't helping.
I knew these rogues would be trouble.
I had no idea how much. - Don't worry about it.
we'll catch this guy.
talk to Birkhoff and Sonya.
they can get you access to the entire network.
keep it quiet. - Right. Sneakysneak.
you're authorized to question anybody you think is of interest.
yeah? Where are you going?
except me.
did anyone see you enter the tunnels?
Nope. Maybe someday I'll get to use the front door.
Madame President.
gentlemen, let's make this quick.
this PDB highlights an incident at Senator Herek's rally as a matter for concern.
the briefing before that flagged the theft of an experimental explosive from...
fort Granville.
fort Granville as the work of possible coverts.
Madame President, in both cases, we
I have thrown them off the scent.
I told them that we had more important work to do, which we do.
we are making progress.
we brought down some serious threats.
we have strong leads on several others.
my priority is the running of this country.
this week I am hosting a delegation from Uzbekistan because they finally have a president who is willing to work with us.
that is the work that this administration needs to be doing.
I can't let the specter of some rogue Black Ops group overshadow that.
if the public gets even a hint of what Division has done, my entire agenda becomes an afterthought.
do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes. Yes, I do.
and we are working on improving our containment strategies.
we are scrubbing the place clean of Percy's legacy.
was Percy really the problem?
excuse me?
or is Division the disease itself?
ma'am, you have to be politic. I don't.
what does that mean?
you know damn well what it means.
special Forces have been placed on ready alert.
we made a deal.
commander Danforth is not saying this has to happen.
but you need to know that it will happen if necessary.
within minutes of the scramble order, they will raid your compound and scrub it clean.
the objective was to shut Division down discreetly.
the objective is not being met.
so you go the other way...
with an attack so loud it can't be covered up?
the cover story's pre-written.
dead assassins can't contradict it.
okay, Evan, stop.
the only person that can give that order is me, and I'm not giving it yet.
the purpose of this meeting was to get on the same page and to get our priorities clear.
Fletcher is promising to color within the lines.
Danforth is saying keep your junk in your pants, or we'll cut it off.
is that politic enough?
the next time we hear of Division in a negative light will be the last time we hear of Division.
how the hell are we gonna get this guy?
his security profile's pretty solid.
once his personal guards turn him in to the Secret Service he's basically untouchable.
so the White House is the end zone.
we can't let him in.
the most secure building in the world?
that's kind of a nonstarter. That leaves his hotel.
he's gonna be there one night before he meets President Spencer.
even if we grab him there, how are we gonna replace him?
the miracle of science.
it's an electro-active polymer.
it changes shape when you run a current through it.
darpa's been developing it to create artificial muscle for wounded soldiers.
if you have detailed enough data, you can achieve...
a mask.
is that you?
it's pretty, ain't it? The perfect replica
same tone and consistency as real skin and muscle.
so who's gonna wear it?
someone the same height and build as Markov, someone who speaks Russian and has experience in cover missions.
you. - Da.
only hitch is, we need ultra-detailed measurements to get this thing to work, which means a laser scan of Markov's face.
should take about two hours.
so we need to build in a two-hour gap between grabbing Markov and replacing him
I mean, me.
so I can see how we get to him, but extraction?
it's not gonna be easy transporting him out of there, not quietly.
we don't have to transport him.
he's gonna transport himself.
all clear.
da.
how's whack-a-mole?
Ryan brought me up to speed.
I'm glad. I could use your help.
I've been scanning server traffic.
find anything?
no. I've been checking for incursions, but all of the packet filters are intact.
if anyone hacked in, they've covered it up really well.
look for a protocol-wrapped tunnel.
a shell program? First thing Seymour had me do.
I told him it would be pretty obvious, and he got all huffy.
I don't know what's worse for Birkhoff
the fact that someone pulled one over on him or that it was me and Nikita.
firewall BREACH 1
someone's breached an internal firewall.
are they contacting someone on the outside?
encrypted NETWORK MEDICAL ACCESS
no, they're on an older server archived records, low-level data.
the access point is medical.
whoever's doing this is there right now.
Nikki's on approach.
detaching from glider...now.
Oops, Nikita. Touchdown.
copy that. Target's in the zone.
okay, you're looking for the H-VAC unit.
it's at the southeast corner.
tap the number three line.
got it.
all right.
is he ready for room service?
almost.
Hey, bring me back some of those chocolates, will you?
they'll be on your pillow tonight.
Thanks. - Sprucing the place up?
making it homier.
no, they're retrofitting the place with new biocontainment safeties.
because of Amanda's Sarin gas attack.
it's the gift that keeps on giving.
Hey, guys, you want to give us a couple minutes?
Thanks.
what's up?
still having problems with your memories?
no change, if that's what you mean.
it must be really frustrating knowing Amanda's got all the answers.
probably very tempting to try and reach out.
what are you talking about?
a restricted server was breached coming from this location.
did anyone ask you to go looking for something?
I don't know what you're talking about, but, yeah, I was hunting... for information on my past.
the file Nikita gave me had nothing, so I figured I'd search the archive.
Yeah, on a classified volume. How did you break in?
just 'cause I was a cleaner doesn't mean I didn't go through the rest of the training.
I didn't realize you were watching me.
why are you asking about Amanda? - Can't be too careful.
if you're worried about her getting into the system, why are you monitoring internal traffic?
you think she has a mole.
that's it, isn't it? Let me help you find him.
wake up.
Yeah, there's a com in your ear. That's why you can hear me.
in your mouth is a modified M67 frag grenade...
which is now armed.
do exactly as I say, or you're gonna have a very, very unhappy dentist.
no, no, no.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
there's a bag next to you. In it is a rappelling harness.
there's a line already outside the window, get yourself down to the street and don't let security see you.
Oh, also...
you have three minutes.
hands!
you stupid bitch.
do you even know what you've done?
taken a murdering psychopath with delusions of grandeur out of commission-- am I in the ballpark?
this could lead to Amanda.
I can't talk to you about this.
you said it yourself.
Amanda has answers about my past.
shut up. - Look, I'm not gonna let you
no, no, seriously shut up.
you hear that?
get in the car.
you have ensured the destruction of Division.
is everyone okay? - Yeah.
Owen and Alex were the only ones here--they got clear.
I'm fine.
how long do we have before we have to get Markov back?
four hours, tops.
let's get him to Birkhoff. Start the scan.
we got to get you changed.
I still have to sample his vocals.
traces of corrosive on the edge.
this was planned. - You sure?
I know my acids.
that mole does not want to be found.
you weren't supposed to say anything.
I didn't tell him. He guessed.
why do I get the feeling you all think I'm an idiot?
okay, pull all the duty rosters, find out who had access, and start questioning them.
if anybody asks, this was an accident.
everyone's jumpy already.
go to the arms locker, get a sidearm.
the mole knows you're on the hunt.
all right, once the mapping's done, it shouldn't take long to shape the polymer.
sampling of his vocals are complete.
how's the hair going?
I'm on it.
all right.
so...
how long are you going to be in cover?
a couple of weeks
just long enough to go to Uzbekistan and arrange for a nice, natural death.
I got to say, I'm not really crazy about you leaving for so long.
we've been apart before.
well, not since we've been engaged.
it makes a difference?
surprisingly, yes.
pitiful.
Percy gave you a gift, a new life, a chance to serve you country.
and what did you do?
could you stop him from moving?
he's gonna screw up the scan. - You betrayed him.
you turned your back on your duty, and for what to play house?
division used to stand for something.
now what do they do?
they hunt down and kill their own.
you had a chance to do the right thing - and turn yourself in. - I did the right thing...
with a little help from Amanda.
Amanda?
Yeah, she helped me craft a message for you.
what message?
you know me as Alexi Markov, duly-elected President of Uzbekistan.
but for ten years, I was an undercover operative with a covert American Black-Ops group known as Division.
my public background and my life--it's a lie.
I was placed in this country to spy on and disrupt local government through murder, torture, and violence.
just like I spied on and disrupted other governments
some of them U. S. allies.
the file has a text attachment names, dates, places.
this video gets released to every major media outlet unless I give my people a password every morning.
let me go, or in a few hours,
division will be exposed to the world, and the full force and fury of the U. S. military will be turned on you.
that's a nice bluff.
I think he knows it's not a bluff.
that's not gonna happen, is it?
how did you find out?
Amanda assumed that the president would have a kill contingency in her back pocket.
what the hell is this guy talking about?
it's okay.
I don't want that video out there any more than you do.
how would I go back to being president?
so I'm gonna make you a deal.
once I sign this military aid agreement with President Spencer, billions of U. S. dollars will be flowing into Uzbekistan.
once I skim my fair share off the top, you'll never hear from me again.
so let me go.
and hurry up?
I got to clean up before I meet the Prez.
get him ready for transport back to the hotel.
you can't be serious.
tell me this isn't true, that you're playing some kind of con.
what does he mean that the government will destroy Division?
the president has made it clear she can't let Division become a liability to her administration.
if it does, Special Forces will come in here and wipe us out.
and unlike the Marines who were set to attack last time, these troops are fully prepped, with complete floor plans and a full roster of every agent and where they live.
plans and rosters-- how could they get them?
I gave it to them.
it was the price for sparing this place the first time.
look, the president had to have a contingency.
a contingency?
you're talking about mass murder.
how could you keep this from me? - Because that's my job!
do you want to do it?
I didn't think so.
we will get Markov another day.
but today, we should let him go.
I'll give your best to the president.
uzbekistan's army-- how big is it?
cause you're gonna need every last man to stop me from getting you.
those are big words. And for what?
your pathetic new Division is not worth saving.
now, if we have any more questions, we'll be in touch.
this is going nowhere.
anyone could have gotten to that oxygen tank.
don't they restrict access to the sublevels anymore?
no. We let people roam around more freely now.
Oh, good...
cause I may move, you know, get out of here.
gas attacks, explosions
I was safer in a Russian prison.
well, if you hadn't been there today,
I would be dead.
actually, I wasn't supposed to be there today.
how could anyone have planned for that?
you weren't the target.
who would want you dead? - In here?
who wouldn't?
I was a reaper.
I killed agents and their loved ones.
that's why Percy kept me out of here for so many years.
what are you doing?
cross-referencing your mission files with the duty roster.
do you recognize any of these names?
Yeah.
no, I'm telling you, I can find the source video.
we still have the cryptograph we nabbed from Amanda.
now, I can get into any system-- Birkhoff
No! I can get into any system in the world with that thing!
okay? We delete all the copies of the video, neutralize the threat, huh?
and Markov makes another video.
you got a better idea? - There aren't any better ideas.
Yes, there is.
we run...
tell everyone in here that their government is trying to kill them, and then we open the barn doors.
you can't be serious.
and have 300 agents panic and go rogue?
or what-- wait to be slaughtered?
it's not gonna come to that.
can you guarantee that?
are you giving me your word, Ryan?
I got another idea.
we can go public, and we can tell our story to the press.
if we go loud enough, the government wouldn't risk touching us.
there'd be too much scrutiny. - No.
why not? - It won't work.
well, why not?
because we're criminals, Michael.
there's a reason the president doesn't trust us.
most of us are ex-prisoners.
some of us are convicted killers.
if we go public, they send us right back to where we were.
and for me, that's death row.
maybe they're right.
maybe we can never change who we are.
no, Nikita, you have to trust
you have lost the right to ask for my trust!
let her be...
for your own safety.
I ain't going back to prison, man.
I'm just putting together an accident report.
okay.
you've been working in medical this week, right?
Yeah, I've been upgrading the biofilters.
right. Do you know Owen?
excuse me? - Owen, the patient in medical.
no.
Owen used to carry out what Percy called "internal sanctions,"
which basically means killing other agents.
and I had Owen look through some old files, and he remembered your name from a mission profile a few years ago.
there was something about you having a relationship with another agent.
I can't remember her name.
I don't know. Was it...?
Julia. Her name was Julia.
right. Julia.
I canceled her.
Owen, we agreed I would handle this.
Percy gave the order, but I carried it out.
you were right to target me.
hold on. Hold on. Hold on. - Carl, drop it.
Owen, move. Drop the knife, now! - Hold on.
drop it.
drop the knife!
Alex? Alex-- - Nikita, stay back.
Nikita - Carl's the one who sabotaged medical.
do you know what he's done? - Yes, I do. Believe me, I do.
then you know why he has to die.
Carl, listen to me. Owen's a different person now.
no, he isn't. He's Division.
that part of you-- that never changes.
you want to kill me? Go ahead.
cause if we really can't change and you're right,
I don't deserve to live.
there's a lot of my past that I don't remember, and some people say I should be able to live with that.
but I can't.
I need to remember...
the good...
and especially the bad.
otherwise how am I going to make up for my sins?
so, yeah...
I remember Julia.
I remember her apartment.
she wore a blue shirt with yellow flowers.
she fought.
she fought so hard.
it should have been me.
she didn't deserve that.
she didn't deserve it.
no one does.
I'm sorry.
the last head of Division lied to me too. He's dead now.
Percy was lying to protect himself.
I was trying to protect all of you.
and you lost everyone's trust, and you let the bad guy get away.
we've still got another shot at Markov.
we've got time until he gets his money, time to figure out how to bring him in.
no, we don't.
I used the cryptograph to get into Markov's personal server.
I found this.
by now, the world knows that President Spencer is dead.
what you don't know is why I had to kill her.
it was her fear and cowardice that lead directly to the murder of a truly great leader.
Percy was a patriot and a visionary.
he took me from the gutters and made me into one of the elites someone who could do anything.
I owe my life to Percy.
he's the greatest man I've ever known.
we got a die-hard Percy loyalist on a suicide run.
it's scheduled to hit in six hours.
he pre-recorded this.
he could snap her neck at any second.
he became president of Uzbekistan just to get into range.
Where's Markov now?
motorcade already left the hotel.
white House itinerary calls for the greeting ceremony in three hours.
what are you doing?
warning the president.
no, no, no.
you tell her the truth about Markov, she triggers the attack on Division.
tell him, Mikey.
Birkhoff, we have a duty to our country.
screw the country. I'm not becoming seal chow.
then I suggest you join Nikita and start running.
no one's running. You're right, Birkhoff.
damn straight.
you tell her the truth, they'll kill us.
we say nothing, he kills her. - No.
we are going to stop Markov.
division is going to save the president's life without her even knowing her life was in danger, because she is wrong about us.
we have changed.
not that I haven't seen you do the impossible, but how exactly are we planning on doing this?
same as before
we grab him, make the switch, fake his death later.
but he's headed for the White House now.
so are we.
okay. I am in the White House security system, courtesy of the cryptograph.
I'm gonna miss that little beauty.
you sure we gotta give her up?
unless you've got a better idea on how to get an audience with the president on short notice.
okay, here we go.
guys, another 500 yards, then turn east.
that will dump you out in the main artery.
it's a good thing I mapped out this level during the underground nuclear reactor situation.
Yes, Birkhoff. Good job, Birkhoff.
shut up, Birkhoff.
Birkhoff, we clear?
good to go.
anyone on the radar? - No.
what's Markov's 20?
Markov is approaching the diplomatic reception area.
this is Rover 1.
V.I.P. has arrived. He's in the D.R.R.
president Markov.
on behalf of the president of the United States,
I'd like to welcome you to the White House.
thank you.
I, uh, am most eager to meet the president.
she is very eager to meet you.
Madame President. - This is gonna have to wait.
I'm sorry but this is a matter of national security.
I'm gonna be a few minutes.
this...
this is the cryptograph. Division recently recovered it.
how's it look?
so cool.
okay, Mikey...
secret Service office is just up to the right.
rover 1, do you have a visual on V.I.P?
affirmative.
did you give him clearance to blue sector?
negative.
bring him here. We need to sort this out.
excuse me, sir. Would you come with me?
are we going to see the president?
not just yet.
with its ability to hack into any computer system in the world, the cryptograph can be an incredibly powerful weapon.
that's great. Get it over to NSA.
I also believe that recovering the cryptograph is proof of Division's benefit and not just with regards to the rogue agents.
this isn't high school, Fletcher.
you don't get extra credit.
just pointing out we're on the right path.
we can discuss this later. - Sorry, Madame president.
but we have an ongoing security incident.
you're gonna have to stay here.
president Markov, thank you for coming.
what is this about?
you understand we need to investigate any uncleared incursions into the restricted sections of the White House.
what does this have to do with me?
I was just wondering how you got into this area.
what?
okay, Markov is with the Secret Service.
I'm gonna draw them away with a distraction.
you should have a 30-second window of opportunity.
copy that--30 seconds.
I've wiped your images off the cameras.
if it was due to a breakdown in our security, we need to make sure it's addressed.
this is ridiculous.
take care of your business on your own time.
sir, if you don't mind
Oh, no, that's not good.
killer in the White House! Killer in the White House!
what happened? - He just took out the agents.
he's making tracks to the Oval Office, and he's armed.
so, whatever you're gonna do, do it now.
we just brought an assassin within 50 yards of the president.
Hey, Eddie.
there you are. Get away from me.
get away from me!
they're coming back this way.
go. I got him.
he's down this way.
I think there's something wrong with him.
they dragged me into a room. It was like the refugee camp.
come on, Nikki, get out of there.
come on. Come on.
what happened?
where am I?
security has contained the situation.
apparently President Markov had some kind of post-traumatic stress episode.
he attacked two agents, but it's under control now.
things are, uh, not clear.
how is he? - I should leave.
guys, Nikita's in the northwest corridor.
we're clear.
copy that.
only ten days after his first visit to the U. S.
president Alexi Markov of Uzbekistan has died from a ruptured brain aneurysm.
his unexpected death brings a dramatic end to a growing scandal regarding his recent election.
last week multiple reports of voting improprieties surfaced, calling into question the results that swept him into power.
the scandal was a nice touch.
I figured it would deter anyone from looking too closely into the death.
was it hard to find the evidence?
not when you're the president.
you guys can count the video as dead and buried too.
I fed a worm into Markov's servers.
anything with even a whiff of that guy is gone.
there might be a few side effects, though.
the entire country's gonna be without Internet for the next couple of days...
possibly Afghanistan too.
apply the ointment for two weeks and let me know if there's any pain.
Thanks.
you're lucky scars are sexy.
yeah? 'Cause I could go find Carl and ask him to grab his knife again.
no, that's just being greedy.
okay.
can I ask you something? - Yeah.
what you told Carl about Julia...
do you remember that much about all of your victims?
if I don't remember them, who will?
what's the butterfly?
I don't talk about that one.
some memories I like to keep for myself.
or maybe I used to catch bugs as a kid.
I don't know. Who knows? My memory's shot.
right.
I got to go. Try and stay out of trouble.
I will.
when I agreed to run Division, I told the president that I couldn't do it without you...
all of you, and that is still true.
so, if I no longer have your support,
I will step down immediately, no questions asked.
this was never about our support.
this is about trust, Ryan.
you didn't have to carry this burden alone.
if I told you when we started this that the president had a gun to our heads, how would you have reacted?
the real question is,
exactly.
under Percy, it was obey or die.
I come in and promise a way out.
then people learn there's one small catch.
there'd be no predicting their actions.
a lot of people in here are still volatile.
tell me about it.
so what, we're just supposed to keep this on the low?
for now.
I know we're not all one big, happy family, but we are in this together...
for better or worse.
I need to believe it's for the better.
if we continue hunting the dirty thirty, we have got to do it smarter, quieter.
forget small footprint. It's got to be no footprint.
so can we do this?
let's find out.
let's be honest, sacrifice is for losers.
I mean, Martyrdom is what it is.
it's exciting.
your family's proud of you, also sad.
but you're not around to reap the rewards, unless we're talking about the afterlife, which, come on, big roll of the dice.
I mean, sure, there could be 77 virgins waiting for you.
there could also be one 77-year-old virgins.
you never know.
we're not interested in suicide.
either am I.
that's why I say live longer, stay remote.
with the Mark 2 Longarm, you can resolve your differences from the comfort of your living room, remote target from anywhere in the world with an optional Sat upgrade.
on this model, we've sacrificed nothing, because sacrifice is for losers.
and what does that make you, Cyrus?
what's this?
come on, you guys didn't think you were the only ones bidding on this, did you?
that's exactly what you told us.
you're right. Shoot her.
I don't even have a gun.
now I do.
me too.
nice to finally meet you, by the way.
big fan. Let's go back to Division.
I'll get you an autograph after I bring you in alive.
Thanks.
but right now I'm a little more concerned about you.
that's a Glock 17, ten box mags, sights are off
classic choice
whereas this is a state-of-the-art, air-cooled, 1,200-round per minute, seven six
seven six two armor-piercing discarding sabot with an automated reload.
you sold one to Wade. He used it on us.
damn it.
you know, it's guys like that give us rogue agents a bad name.
you're the one currently pointing an assault cannon at my fiancee.
fiancee.
Congrats.
I walk, he lives. You keep the Longarm.
think of it as a wedding present
and all that.
Oh, I don't know.
honey, wasn't there a problem with the override systems thing?
Yes, yes, Birkhoff found it kind of easy to hack.
how about that autograph?
how about that wedding present?
anything you want, name it.
uzbekistan present suddenly dies.
this is her handiwork, her latest triumph.
I still think you should let me kill her.
death would be a mercy, Anne.
Andallusa, Spain.
she doesn't deserve mercy.
what does she deserve, then?
Nikita thinks she can run Division without selling her soul.
she's wrong.
she's going to have to sacrifice more than she could ever imagine.
that is the lesson she needs to learn.
how will she learn it?
the same way she's learned everything she knows
I teach her.
when?
if one is patient, the oportunity will always present itself.
perhaps sooner than anticipated.
Nikita returned from Mission-0930
there it is.
is the mole sending another message?
they're not done yet.
will learn more
can we piggyback our trace to Amanda's location?
I'm trying.
it keeps getting lost in dark space.
okay, okay, just try and isolate the terminal they're sending from.
Rerouted... multiple times.
son of a bitch. How does he keep doing this?
how do you know it's a he?
okay, daughter of a bitch.
whoever it is, they're in the building right now.
I got to go tell Nikki.
you keep trying to trace the source terminal.
do we have a clear path to interrogation?
Yeah, no one's going to see you.
so what about the mole hunt ? - We're closing in.
mole is active.
he knows you're back, but not where you went or who you got.
who do you got, by the way?
Birkhoff, hey, how did you manage to hack the Longarm?
you guys busted your ass to find this guy, the gun guy?
he knows where Amanda is.
I told you, I haven't seen Amanda in years.
why do you want her so bad?
she declared war on us.
VZ58 super shorties with modifications.
your modifications.
we recovered these on a raid of Amanda's safe house in Luxembourg.
once I figured out that you sold them to her,
I put you at the top of our list.
I made a list.
Yeah, when you cut out your tracker and refused to return to Division.
Percy put me into the world to be his guy who could get anything.
special orders, untraceable gear, stuff that you could drop in the field that wouldn't point back to Division.
the world was my office.
champagne, yachts, and women.
so excuse me for not immediately reporting back to the underground bunker in New Jersey when so commanded.
my heart breaks for you. It really does.
but if you ever want to see the sun again, you're gonna tell me exactly what I want to know.
I like the sun.
Amanda-- you supply her.
I want to know where you're supplying her next and when.
she moves around.
I deal mostly with her boyfriend now.
russian guy.
always making special orders.
some of the stuff I can't get, some I can.
I'm on the trail of a next-gen weapon right now.
I was gonna pick it up this week in the Caribbean
St. Lucia.
and when you get it ? - I contact Ari.
he tells me where to meet.
you grab him, you get to dragon lady.
and why do I smell a catch there is one？
not a good idea.
you just caught this guy.
I know, but this is how we get Amanda.
listen, you're gonna love it.
this is what Cyrus is buying-- Sideswipe.
it's a missile jammer.
actually, it's a multispectral array.
it can trick anything you shoot at it, from an RPG to a Sidewinder.
it jams missiles.
and other stuff.
look, check it out.
the Pentagon slipped a prototype to the Egyptian army for the war on terror.
but this man,
general Tariq Rafat, has fled the Egyptian army, and he's taken the Sideswipe with him.
he's on his way to St. Lucia to sell it to Cyrus.
what's Cyrus want with it?
profit. Resell it to Ari Tasarov.
what's Ari want with it ? - More profit.
he plans to resell it to his old contacts in Russian defense.
which would put their helicopters on par with ours - in a heartbeat. - It'll never get that far.
we're gonna run a tight screen on Cyrus at the sale.
you get Sideswipe, we get Ari, but, you know, most importantly...
we get Amanda.
but first, we've got to put this snake back in the pit and give him the real tech
risk it falling into the wrong hands.
Ryan, it's already in the wrong hands.
Amanda's got a mole in here. She's hunting me.
I want her first.
the only way to get to her is through Ari.
those two are attached at the hip.
okay, Cyrus, let's make a deal.
ten men for surveillance?
I need it.
well, I need a security detail.
don't be unreasonable.
when it comes to Nikita, I can be very unreasonable.
look what happened in Luxembourg.
you happened in Luxembourg.
your obsession with Nikita almost killed both of us, and now I have to recoup our losses.
all you care about is money. - Open your eyes, Amanda.
our soldiers don't work for free.
they're hired with the money from the deals I made, money that is meant to build something.
after this deal, you'll have all the resources you could ever need.
sometimes to get what you want, you have to make sacrifices.
you know, this tracker thing really ruins my bikini line.
michael thought you might try to run when we get to St. Lucia.
so paranoid. - I know.
I told him to relax, everything's under control.
what the hell was that?
I upgraded your tracker with a little voltage spike to the sciatic nerve.
makes running a little bit ouch.
I thought torture was Amanda's thing.
your lucky you didn't have one of Amanda's trackers.
they were paired with kill chips
drop an agent like that if they got out of line.
we deactivated them, every last one of them.
you really think you can turn Division around, don't you?
and you don't think I can.
this place was designed to do some very bad things and keep secret.
old habits die hard.
you feel weak.
and you're angry because you feel weak.
you have a right to feel that way.
you're an addict.
you're not the only one in Division, which is why we do random searches.
oxycodone from medical.
I didn't have any.
but you wanted to.
you will always want to.
and sometimes that need will become rage.
you can use that, Alex.
take it easy on that arm.
it's not 100% yet.
I'm fine.
you don't look fine.
have you heard from Sean?
Michael, do you really want to talk to me about boys?
no.
I'm just anxious to get back out there, that's all.
Yeah, well, don't be too anxious.
jet leaves in 20.
SOBELEX.
St. LUCIA
so how many guys does the general usually roll with?
Tariq?
four or five guys since they have the Sideswipe.
shouldn't be too much trouble, once they see how relaxed I am chilling with my lady.
we got a couple minutes to kill...
at least.
was that necessary?
for Michael, it was.
he's got your head in a rifle scope right now.
easy there, Romeo.
can you believe this guy?
I got two suits taking positions on the rooftop of the pavilion.
tariq must be close.
they're packing sidearms, maybe a subgun.
I don't know if they've got vests, but maybe we should switch to A. P. rounds.
Alex, we knew they'd be packing.
we're not here to start a fight.
something wrong?
just keep to your target.
you know, you've been on edge ever since we got off the plane.
if you want to talk about it, maybe I could
save me?
help.
why do guys think they always need to fix or save or help?
look, I have no trouble with you getting Amanda or whatever you want, as long as I get what I want.
and what do you want?
after we get the Sideswipe and we get Ari's location, you let me vanish.
give me one good reason.
because you owe me.
Oh, this should be good.
how do I owe you, Cyrus?
you think you're the only person that can track someone through their weapons.
when you went rogue and declared war on Percy, you didn't just pick up a 12-gauge from Big 5.
that Beretta A. R.X. with the ACOG scope and modified stock for your petite frame
I tracked that particular cocktail through the back channels designed to make it untraceable and it led me to...
your fabulous loft in Chelsea.
nice pad, by the way.
my favorite lair of yours, by far.
that A. R.X. I got from Travis in, what, June 2010?
you're telling me you knew where I was the whole time?
the dealer's name was Trevor.
it was July, and I'm telling you
I knew where you were the whole time, and I never told a soul.
Why?
upstairs.
it's go time.
Sammy, have you seen Birkhoff?
he's not in his club den?
no, I was just there.
can I ask you something?
have you heard this rumor about a mole?
what rumor?
just whispers.
I thought maybe you heard something from the round table.
the round table?
you know, Camelot...
Nikita's inner circle.
they always seem to know more than they're telling us.
since you're dating Birkhoff, I thought maybe you heard
how did you know I was dating Birkhoff?
come on, you know it's hard to keep secrets in here.
that's Division. Someone's always watching.
whoever it is, they're in the building right now.
ow, now, boys, no need to get paranoid.
we're buying goodies today, not carrying them.
he's clean.
general, how's that Rhino working out for you?
Oh, I love it.
I plan to order a few more from you.
make my day.
baby, you got to try this out. I'm gonna get you one.
Oh, I'm good. I don't like guns.
this gun you're gonna love. Trust me.
let's get down to business.
we never fully settled on a price.
I think that's fair.
nice. Mind if I try?
I don't have a missile for you to jam, but go ahead.
signal's blocked.
connecting lost.
so is Cyrus' tracker.
sig interference.
where the hell are you guys?
that's not good.
all good.
one problem.
she's an Interpol agent.
I'm under duress, and this meeting's about to get busted right now.
you son of a-- - Take her!
no.
good luck.
he's down!
what the hell are you?
come on.
come on! Come on!
he has the Sideswipe.
and we don't have him.
nice place you got here...
very medieval.
actually, it was rebuilt after the second World War.
the catacombs below
they date back to the Crusades...
when blacksmiths were forging the blades of the holy wars.
I guess back then my business was God's business.
Amen.
we heard there was some trouble in St. Lucia.
anything we should be worried about unless you're an Egyptian national wanted for war crimes.
it was only a matter of time before Interpol caught up with Tariq.
excellent work, Cyrus.
Nikita returned from Caribbean.
Andalusir, Spain.
Cyrus' tracker is back online.
must have handed over the Sideswipe to Ari.
where is he?
southern Spain.
your payment.
it's all there.
ow, if you'll excuse me, I have a plane waiting.
Sideswipe, I hardly knew you.
how long will you be gone, dear?
not long at all.
I don't mean to impose, but do you mind if I get out of these clothes? - It's been a long trip. - Down the hall.
okay, we can have a team out there in under seven hours.
forget it. -- He won't be there for more than one.
he's probably cutting out his tracker as we speak.
so we didn't get Tasarov.
he got the Sideswipe.
he's about to deliver it God-knows-where, and Cyrus is out in the wind.
we know where they met. We know Ari is in Spain.
Amanda's probably there too.
let's go now. - They won't be there.
they'll move on after Cyrus warns them.
he's team Amanda, remember.
no, he's team Cyrus. He made that very clear.
look, I have no problem with you getting Amanda or whatever you want, as long as I get what I want.
well, he left us with zero.
just a gun.
this gun you're gonna love.
trust me.
wait a minute.
what is it?
son of a...
you get what you want,
I get what I want.
Krilov Industries.
you owe me twice. What does that mean?
Ari Krilovnu owes me twice!
Krilov, where is that?
Ari's headed to Romania.
we grab him. -- He will lead us to Amanda.
feeling better?
like new, thanks. But I better get going.
so soon.
well, you know how this business is.
got to keep moving
I can smell her on you.
I selected that perfume for Nikita years ago.
I know a lot of women.
I'm only interested in one.
all right, easy, easy.
you don't need that.
we're all friends here.
Nikita grabbed me a couple days ago.
she tried to edge in on my deal and get Sideswipe.
I shook her and came straight here.
then why not tell us that when you arrived?
why lie?
you get Sideswipe, I get paid.
the rest is just noise.
see, I don't think so.
I think you're protecting her.
I know you, Cyrus.
remember our sessions?
you used to talk about your father.
the sad tale of the police officer charged with corruption.
rings a bell.
he was innocent, and everyone knew it.
but he still lost his badge and drank himself to death.
it must have been so sad for a little boy to watch someone he loved suffer so much.
I got over my issues.
you should try it sometimes.
see, I used to think that this experience explained your aggressive neutrality.
no good deed goes unpunished,
wait, wait
I told her.
she knows about Romania.
she knows about Ari's deal.
I think deep down you're more like your father than you want to admit.
I can see it.
there's good in you, and I'm betting Nikita saw it too.
but, now, this is something I can work with.
you see, Anne,
I told you an opportunity would present itself.
the factory Cyrus told us about is abandoned, which means it's gonna be easier to raid, but we need to grab Ari and the Sideswipe before the Russians get there.
I can get an Alpha team in there.
Michael, you'll have to guard that door.
Alex, we'll need you on the roof.
got it.
Birkhoff, the mole cannot get wind of this.
where are you on the hunt?
tracking the source has been tough.
I did solve a big piece of the puzzle, though.
what?
the messages aren't being sent in real time.
they're on a 30-minute delay.
guys, we just intercepted a video call on our private relay.
it's Amanda. Start a trace.
futile trace is already in process.
Hello, Nikita.
I'm sorry I missed you in Luxembourg, but I had urgent business elsewhere.
Oh, no doubt.
you needed to find some rat trap to hole up in.
my new home is quite comfortable -- Thank you.
in fact, I have my very first houseguest right here.
a friend of yours.
say hello to Cyrus.
he's no friend of mine.
Cyrus has been quite reticent when it comes to you, specifically what you two talked about back in Division.
it wasn't really that interesting.
then this should be easy.
you tell me what Cyrus is holding back, and I give him the gift of a quick death, or I find out the truth my way
your choice.
do me a favor, Amanda.
keep those ropes tight. He's slippery.
you could've told her something false and spared him the pain.
that pain is gonna buy him time.
I'm going after him. Where？
tracker says he's still in Spain--Andalucia.
that's probably where Amanda is.
correction-- that's where Amanda's trap is.
she's luring you there.
that's why she kept his tracker online.
Michael, I owe him. - He made his choices.
I know. That's why I got to go get him.
Nikita, you know I can't authorize this.
I won't stop you, but I can't send a team with you.
Yeah, I know. I'm going alone.
Oh, you're not.
okay, you can't be in Spain and Romania at the same time.
your plan to get Ari and the Sideswipe is good.
you designed it.
who's gonna carry it out.-- I'll do it.
I can prep a team, be wheels up in an hour.
I am just dying to say hello to Ari.
all right.
it's decided.
let's do it.
I know. I'll make sure they're covered.
both of them.
all right, all right, all right.
filter program on.
server protocols active.
flux capacitor fluxing.
ready.
let's see your moley ass get out of this one.
got ya!
unauthorized traffic.
Oh, yeah.
tracing source terminal.
where have you been?
I am hot on the mole.
turns out they were sending messages on a 30-minute delay.
what about the source terminal?
that has been a little bit trickier.
using a new filter program that hunts down rerouting algorithms.
found the last relay, but it didn't...
didn't find the source yet.
where was the relay?
terminal on sublevel nine.
it just said...
Nikita has left. Destination unknown.
well, we should investigate that terminal and see what we can find.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll,-- I'll go down there with you.
don't let anyone see you in transit, just to be safe.
Nikita has left. Destination unknown.
I bet I know where she's headed.
she's on her way to rescue you.
Nikita doesn't care about me.
disagree, but that's why we test.
car's ready.
we going somewhere?
goodbye, Cyrus.
it's just up there.
is this the terminal the mole used?
you tell me.
how long?
since I've been here?
please.
since we were together?
is that why we were together?
don't.
was any of it real, what happened between us?
any of it?
take one more step, and I will kill you.
then do it.
I'm dead anyway.
Amanda--she reactivated my kill chip.
on my way home to my apartment three weeks ago, a van pulled up, and this woman grabbed me.
Anne, she was a cleaner.
they threw me in the back of the van and
stop. Stop it! Stop!
I don't believe you.
she showed me the uplink.
Amanda's not here.
so she can't know if you asked for help, which you never did.
there's someone else inside.
she told me there was someone else and that they'd be watching.
and in Division, there's always someone watching.
you can't know that's true.
I can't know that it isn't.
she has me restricted.
I have to send her an update every two hours.
I haven't slept the night in weeks.
if I even walk in the direction of medical, which Amanda gas-bombed as a warning to me, her spy will see and tell her, and she will trigger the chip, and I will drop
okay, okay, all right.
all right.
I wanted to tell you.
I was so scared.
I was scared that they would see it on my face, and they would know.
okay.
all right.
we can beat this.
when my people get back from overseas.
no. - Yes.
I'm gonna fill them in quietly, yes.
Oh, you can't tell anyone. It could be anyone.
it's not Nikita, okay. It's not Michael or Alex.
how do you know? - I know.
you don't know! You don't know!
okay, all right. You need to calm down.
if there is another spy, they can't see you like this.
they can't know anything's wrong.
they have to think you're still with the program.
when do you have to send your next update? 12 minutes.
all right, we give them something.
something true but low value.
that'll buy us some time.
and then we will figure a way out of this.
Oh, we're in Spain. She is in Romania.
Yeah, that's right. Do you have the coordinates?
no, no, trust me. Thank you.
all good. - Let's hope so.
you. - I will be.
Hey, whatever happens, I'm really glad you're here.
please, you know I love Spain.
I know I pushed too hard on this.
all right, then do me one favor.
if Amanda really is here, push harder.
this time, kill the bitch.
where is she?
she's gone.
you really shouldn't have come for me.
how's it wired? -- Pressure plates?
no. No, it's remote.
she wanted to be the one.
so glad you could make it.
and I see you've brought your fiance
what a nice surprise. Congratulations, you two.
we're not here to chat.
well, then let's start the lesson, shall we?
if we get any closer, we're in the blast radius.
Nikita, just go. Go!
there's no way to disarm the bomb on site.
what's the point of a test I can't pass?
it's not a test. It's a lesson...
the first of many. This one is simple.
to stop me, you're going to have to sacrifice the people you care about, even the ones you care about just a little, like Cyrus there.
as a bonus, your friends in Romania are about to suffer as well.
I'm sorry.
I told her.
Krilov factory, Romania.
target reached. Moving in.
got you in view.
hold positions.
Rlex.
old news.
ops, We got an empty nest here.
sig interference.
ops, signal is lost. Can you
if you really wanted to teach me something, why aren't you here?
it's not in the lesson plan, not this time.
I'll give you 20 seconds.
Nikita, we have to go. - I'm not leaving.
listen to Michael. She will kill you.
and believe it or not...
that would upset me very much.
please, go.
no.
I get it now...
the lesson.
the things we care about can hurt us, so the trick is not to care.
Nikita, no!
let's see how well you learn.
what are you waiting for?
do it!
do it!
cover me.
what now?
how did?
michael said you might need some backup.
why'd you do this for me?
why'd you risk your life?
don't take this the wrong way, but I didn't.
Amanda wants to teach me a lesson, she can't do it if I'm dead. She cares too much.
she's not done with me yet.
so what are we looking at? A farm in Lowa? Maybe something by the beach in Maine?
we were wondering, after St. Lucia and Romania, if you think you can still operate your business?
it'll take some damage control, some fence-mending, but, yeah, absolutely.
consider yourself reinstated.
help us get what we need to run operations and shut the doors on Division.
what's this?
it's a list of organizations and individuals with whom you can no longer do business, not as a sanctioned American agent.
it's, like, everyone I ever sold.
I like a challenge.
good.
we'll be in touch.
what?
I knew you were warming up to me.
I knew you'd pick a side.
what's the real reason you didn't give me up to Percy?
you were doing the right thing.
let's just say that you remind me of someone.
you're still here.
Yeah, just debriefed with Ryan.
great.
look, about Romania, I just wanted to say
no need to explain yourself. It's fine.
well, I wasn't gonna explain myself.
I just wanted to say thank you.
michael asked me to do a job, and I did it.
that's all.
another rogue in from the cold, and we've taken the Sideswipe off the black market for good.
any update on the mole?
Yeah, I think I'm, uh, getting close.
and what about Amanda?
any theories as to her next move?
Yes.
before today, I thought that Amanda just wanted me dead because I was the obstacle to her plans.
but that's not it.
I am her plan.
she doesn't want to kill me.
she wants me to suffer, and that means destroying everything I care about.
I'm not her target.
all of you are.
should have responded to your recall earlier.
you made the right choice.
chance to bury Division?
I'm in. - It's what we do.
welcome to the winning side.
ops, I got visual on target.
okay, Nikki, be careful.
we don't know what her contact is armed with.
relax.
I have to warn her. I have to warn Amanda.
no.
if she finds out I didn't warn her, she will trigger my kill chip, and I will die right here.
that's not gonna happen.
she's going down. You're getting free.
I'm sorry.
I already did. I had to.
Nikki, look out! It's a trap!
well, that worked out.
why didn't you tell me?
because he didn't trust you.
I no longer require your services.
No!
just tell her.
just tell her.
I can't breathe, Nikki.
nerd?
are you ever not armed? Seriously?
why are you shadowing me?
I had to make sure nobody else was.
okay.
you said you felt like you were being watched for, like, a month now.
Yeah, but I haven't spotted anyone till now.
there's a good reason for it.
trust me.
Sonya is the mole.
what? - She needs your help.
about three weeks ago,
Amanda's cleaner grabbed her coming out of her apartment.
they reactivated her kill chip.
now if she doesn't update them every two hours, she's considered compromised.
she couldn't take ten minutes to ask for help?
we can remove her chip in medical.
no, no, no, there's a second mole.
someone whose sole job it is to watch her, make sure she stays in line.
she has access to you, to us.
Yeah, Amanda wants her to focus on personal dirt.
she doesn't care about the missions.
she's playing the long game.
she wants to see me suffer.
you did the right thing telling me.
but we--we gotta tell the others.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
I told Sonya that
listen, I'll keep it quiet.
trust me, I promise.
okay.
in the meantime, make sure Sonya plays along.
you are now division's most wanted.
most wanted.
that's what I like to hear.
how do you know she isn't playing you?
do I detect a hint of jealousy, Anne?
no. Suspicion.
why do you trust Sonya?
she has an explosive in her brainstem that I have on speed dial.
who needs trust?
as long as you know when to use it.
let's check the weather then.
partially cloudy but still a balmy .
you see?
Wailea Beach?
if our friend on the inside senses Sonya is flirting with betrayal, the forecast on this weather site changes, and I retire Sonya.
this must be what it felt like to be Nikita.
on the run from place to place, launching her war from a laptop with a mole inside Division.
she lives inside stronger walls now.
but in a way, she's weaker than ever.
even the strongest walls can come crashing down.
all you need to find is a single crack on the surface.
what are you doing here?
it's a nice day. I took a walk.
Yeah. - It's a little warm to wear that jacket?
not really. Were you following me?
should I be? - No.
I--I just-- lately I've been feeling like someone's been watching me.
we all have.
we're letting Amanda's mind games get to us.
or maybe you just took too many of these.
Sobelex?
I thought I saw the signs on you a few days ago.
give it back, Michael.
Why? They're not yours.
they're Division's.
it's an experimental painkiller designed for combat use, not recommended for ex-drug addicts.
I was only taking it for my shoulder.
I wanted to help out. - Help?
this doesn't just put your life in danger, Alex.
this puts my life in danger.
nikita's.
and anyone who relies on you to shoot straight and back them up in the field.
I do.
it's Nikita. - Okay, look, Michael.
look, you're right, okay? I'll stop, I'll stop.
just please don't tell Nikita. Please.
I'm on my way.
we're needed back at the office.
thank you. - Don't.
I made the decision to talk to you before Nikita because this would hurt her more than anyone, on account of everything she's gone through for you.
so you are gonna be the one that tells her.
and in the meantime, you're gonna clean up, and you're not going back out into the field until that happens.
what did Nikita want?
looks like we're both gonna find out.
all right, people, we need to up our game.
let's close the net.
now we know that she was in Luxembourg three weeks back and Andalusia six days ago.
we need to figure out where she's going next.
let's go!
Sonya, where's the list of her confiscated inventory?
almost done.
we need it now. Bring it into briefing.
Yes, sir.
that should buy us some time.
you call that believable?
okay, people, we need to up our game.
Birkhoff, calm down.
it sounded fake.
we should be doing this in Ryan's office anyway.
then I couldn't be here.
your fake inventory, sir.
are you sure there's a second mole?
no, but I can't take the risk.
let's start going over our options.
surgery, remove the chip.
we lost our best surgeon in Amanda's attack on medical.
surgery takes six hours minimum.
and I have to check in every two.
which rules out a trip to an outside hospital as well.
why can't someone else check in for you?
the second mole would see and alert Amanda.
what about deactivation?
three hours. Laparoscopic procedure.
portable equipment.
still gotta buy the extra hour.
wait, didn't Amanda deactivate your kill chip once?
how'd that work?
she electrocuted me.
I was clinically deceased for 32 seconds.
it fooled the chip.
I'm not getting killed to save my life.
I have to get back to my station.
wait, there is another way.
we kill the threat at its source.
we kill Amanda.
how?
she relies on you for intel. We set a trap.
end this for good.
no, no, no, no, no.
that means leaving her kill chip active.
this is about how we deactivate it.
but this could be the only ...
No!
no, we're not risking her life any further.
it's not your life, Seymour.
it's mine.
everyone in here is trying to save me, and all I've done is jeopardize your lives by not asking for help sooner.
besides, I want revenge for what she's done to me.
let's bait the bitch.
I knew I liked her.
Brikhoff developing new
my partner
top secret Birkhoff device.
not interested.
no,
better step it up, honey, or it's die time.
you wanted to see me?
Yeah.
Yes, I did.
what do you think?
it's nice.
nice?
this is a hydraulic battering ram with spike deployment.
we've got N. O.S. booster, onboard radar, oil slick.
see those headlights right there?
they launch laser-guided missiles.
Really?
no, but how cool would that be if they did?
that's why we all gotta get on board and convince Ryan it's worth spending the cash.
Michael, spare me the Psych 101, okay?
well, she's all you ever talk about at home, here.
it's always about Amanda. I'm getting sick of this
awkward.
we were just leaving.
Yeah, we were.
see, this is exactly what I'm talking about.
we can't get a moment alone in here.
is this what's wrong, or is there something else bothering you?
why does there need to be something else?
because lately it feels like you're holding back, - No, no, no. - you're suppressing something.
the only one who's holding back is you.
you are holding us back.
once we got rid of Percy, we were supposed to be done with this place, but now with your obsession
what? No! No! - Yes, yes, with your obsession, you are blind to the problem in front of you.
what?
are we done yet?
the camera stopped ten seconds ago.
I just didn't want you to break character.
are we sure this is gonna work?
you and me fighting, Amanda catnip.
okay, I will compress and upload the video to her, and then I will tell her that Michael has gone off to the pub to drown his sorrows in drink.
no, send the video, let it marinate, and then on your next update, let her know where Michael will be drinking.
and we're positive Amanda's gonna show up?
I don't know, could be she sends Anne.
she sends Anne, we follow her to Amanda.
either way, we have to plant the bait, so let's get started.
we're on a schedule, go.
Hey, guys, I just wanted to say how much it means to me
Hey, Nerd, can we do this later?
you have another mole to I.D.
Ryan and Alex are waiting, phase two.
right, cool. - Great.
you're awesome.
what?
let's not fight like that.
phase two, whac-a-mole.
all right, people.
everybody listen up.
we've got our first lead on Amanda.
with your help, we can finish this.
Alex is gonna bring you up to speed.
based on our intel, we believe Amanda has a safe house within a 2-mile radius of Hofgarten.
I want everyone to pool their resources and do whatever you can to close the circle even further.
okay, stations 2, 5,6, 8,10, and 13.
that many people spiked at the mention of Amanda?
Yeah, now let's narrow it down even further.
see who reacts to Sonya reacting.
go.
and then there were four.
better get going and prep the next phase.
on it.
it's Alex. Ops, we're a go.
is this what's wrong, or is there something else bothering you?
okay, why does there need to be something else?
because lately it feels like you're holding back.
do you see what I see?
I see why you forbid relationships when you were running Division.
Nikita is perceptive. Michael is hiding something.
and I have an idea what it might be.
well, it's all coming together or falling apart.
contact the Watchman.
tell him I have another assignment for him.
I don't understand how he gets so close to take these pictures.
we all have our specialty.
you have your knife. The Watchman has his eye.
I find the cracks on the surface.
anything yet?
she should have responded by now.
what if she knows?
she doesn't.
wait.
Dealtown Shoe Outlet?
Amanda encodes her orders on regular websites using steganography.
why would Amanda have Sonya watching the two of you?
she must have had someone following us.
us? Both of you?
we ran into each other this morning.
Michael, stop.
Nikita, a couple weeks ago, I started using again.
what?
michael found out and confronted me.
she was supposed to tell you.
she was supposed to?
but it wasn't the right time.
this thing with Sonya- - Wait, using what?
Yes, using what, Alex.
Sobelex for my arm.
it helped me retrieve the cryptograph, okay?
no, if I had told you, you would have had me benched.
you're damn right I would have.
Nikita- - No, you understand even less.
a member of our team is unstable, and you don't warn me, you don't warn Ryan?
I wanted to avoid this type of overreaction.
overreaction? She is an addict, Michael.
all right. Guys, guys, stop.
listen to yourselves.
okay, this is what Amanda wants, the lies, the blame.
fracture.
Birkhoff's right, we set out to fake a fight for Amanda, and here we are in a real one.
well, this was my fault, so I'll stand down.
no.
we are going to adjust, and we are going to work with what we have.
we have confirmation that Amanda is tailing us.
we've suspected it for weeks.
I didn't see anyone, and I was looking.
if you were surveilled, it had to be at extremely long range.
or extremely close.
Amanda has another rogue on her side.
Oh, sit. The Watchman.
who's the Watchman?
he's a Division legend and now our ticket to Amanda.
she thinks something's going on between the two of you.
let's give the lady what she wants.
excellent work on the last batch of photos.
exactly the kind of intel I was looking for.
doesn't come cheap.
stay with Michael and Alex.
don't worry about Nikita for now.
whatever's happening between the two of them is more important.
I'll begin as soon as the money hits my account.
already on its way.
this was taken from a park cam earlier today.
here's me and Alex, and here's the Watchman.
how can you be sure that's him?
because we had Birkhoff run his facial recog program through all the surrounding cameras.
he was able to track everyone from the coffee cart about 12 blocks.
this guy vanished in one.
vanished?
that's his specialty.
the Watchman was Division's close surveillance expert.
he was able to change his appearance at a moment's notice, he made it a habit.
his job was to surveil a target without making them aware they were even being followed.
only Percy and Amanda knew his name and what he really looked like.
what's in his file? - Never had one.
his other job was to investigate Division agents.
he did routine checks on everyone, observed them in their cover lives and made sure they didn't break any rules.
which is why he only reported to Percy and Amanda.
he's about to write his last report.
I'm still not sure about this.
you want Michael and I to pretend to rendezvous in some nightclub.
Sonya will feed the address to Amanda.
this is a photo op.
wherever you go, the Watchman will follow, and I will follow him.
when he makes contact with Amanda, we trace his communications and zero her location.
now what about the second mole?
they're still in play.
Birkhoff's got that under control.
okay, people, look alive.
what are we doing down here?
what's with all the questions?
so Halon system went off, covered the tower, fried eight of the nodes.
did it malfunction? - No.
our fire prevention system suddenly became self-aware and decided to attack us with whipped cream.
that's a joke.
anyway, people, the point is we're in the middle of the hunt for Amanda.
we need to be up and running at full capacity.
so I want each of you to choose two nodes and rebuild them from the ground up.
what? That'll take hours.
then you better stop whining and get to work.
cause none of you are leaving until the job's done.
enjoy.
malfunction, my ass.
this looks like sabotage.
what do you think, Baker?
another present from our friendly neighborhood mole?
I think you should just stop talking.
we've got a lot of work to do.
I don't want to be stuck down here all night with you and your conspiracy theories.
excuse me.
you guys are supposed to be having an affair, not on the most awkward date ever.
well, it is awkward.
I'm on a date with my best friend's boyfriend, and her voice is in my head.
fiance. Now pretend you like each other.
you know what, why don't we start with pretend you know each other?
so what do we talk about? - I don't know.
I've never cheated on anyone before.
me neither.
well, as long as we're here, we might as well talk about your recovery.
there's a detox treatment, it's called buprenorphine.
Bupawhat?
it makes it easier to come off the stronger stuff.
it also eases the pain.
that's just the first step.
what's the second?
you need to talk to someone.
I'm pretty sure that if I told a shrink about the secret government agency I work with, they would have me committed.
Nikita, any news on our shapeshifting friend?
well, he came here for a show, and you guys are giving him nothing.
we need him to accomplish his mission, force him to exit.
what do you have in mind?
kiss her.
are you joking?
Michael, jokes are funny. We're on a mission.
okay, be a good, little spy, and kiss her.
it's okay.
sorry. Just when I thought this couldn't get any more uncomfortable.
she ratchets it to a whole new level.
gotcha.
Birkhoff, do you have an image?
Yeah, but it's not gonna do much good.
he's gonna change up his look to screw with my street cam algorithms.
I'm gonna have to do this manual.
call it out.
get ready to adjust your image for tan raincoat.
I lost him.
12th and Bennett. Probably went out the front.
got him.
he just hopped in a cab off Bennett.
following him now.
Birkhoff, you got him?
I'm on the leader.
go. Go, go, go.
okay, he's at 69th, just off Amsterdam Ave.
523 69th Street, Apartment One.
got it.
he's transmitting directly to an I. P. address in Quebec City.
pulling the coordinates now.
he's all yours.
Oh, yeah.
ready for your close-up?
Birkhoff, got some trash for pickup.
you guys should be set.
wish I was going with you.
you should be here.
Birkhoff's gonna need someone to watch his back when he starts the deactivation.
who watches the Watchman?
did you kick him in the peeping Toms?
Yeah.
speaking of, there are a lot more photos on this than we actually thought.
what? - Well, he's got a couple shots of you proposing to me in Tribeca.
what?
after I took ten showers,
I was thinking it might actually be a nice keepsake.
can you give this to Ryan? Yes, absolutely.
I know it's been a rough day, but we'll talk about your relapse when I get back, okay?
be careful. - Okay.
it's a two-hour flight to Quebec City.
you can change on the plane.
Michael, do you think I'm obsessed?
what?
with getting Amanda.
that was our fake fight.
I'm having trouble keeping track.
Yeah, Amanda knows how to hurt us more than anyone else.
I know that I won't be able to breathe easy until she's gone.
I just have this feeling that something's gonna happen.
something.
to Sonya?
Nikita, we can't control the future.
what's important is, whatever happens, we face it together.
that's all that matters to me.
let's finish this.
we can't wait.
we can't wait any longer.
we've got to start this thing now.
Nikita and Michael aren't in position yet.
they're an hour outside Amanda's location.
deactivation takes three hours.
let's get this thing going.
okay, we haven't the second mole yet.
we can't wait for that.
what if the mole has a check-in time?
we don't know.
we don't even know if the mole is real.
all I know, the kill chip is active.
I need to make it the other way.
where do you want to do this?
sublevel 12.
Amanda's old torture room?
Yeah, nobody goes down there. We won't be bothered.
how long will our suspects be occupied?
four hours, tops.
do it.
if anyone leaves, I'll deal with them.
I've got your back.
okay, I'm freaking out.
why are you not freaking out?
I don't see how that would help.
I'm focusing on the plan.
there's gotta be another way we can do this that doesn't involve risking your life.
we've already narrowed down the list of suspects to four.
they're under surveillance.
so you can finally disable this damn thing in my head.
how can you be so sure this is gonna work?
I'm about to let you poke at my brain with a needle.
apparently I trust you.
okay, come on.
make yourself comfortable.
okay, just lean forward.
just like that.
looks scary.
actually, it's a very...
a simple procedure.
okay.
now just relax.
just...
stay calm.
take deep breaths.
okay, now this is just a local anesthetic.
a slight pinch.
gonna need you to hold very still.
whatever you say, Dr. Birkhoff.
I'm supposed to keep asking you questions to make sure your brain's functioning properly.
I think the sarcasm quadrant is working just fine.
ask away.
are you serious?
anything to distract me.
okay.
what are you gonna be for Halloween this year?
a princess.
Oh, a princess?
Leia?
Zelda.
I knew you were gonna be Zelda.
well, then why'd you say Leia?
3% progress.
because it distracted you.
didn't it?
hard part's over.
damn it!
stupid cart.
that looks serious.
I'm gonna go to medical. - Right.
server room.
Yes, this is Alex. Is Baker there? I've got a question.
you just missed him. He's headed to medical.
accidentally cut himself.
did Baker come by here?
I don't see anything.
movement, second left.
now I can't get a clear shot.
we're gonna have to go inside, up close and personal.
we can't risk breach until Sonya's chip is deactivated.
Birkhoff, how is she?
47% and climbing.
you always did like the recruits, didn't you?
your friend Marcel contacted Ari.
he's willing to meet, but only if you're there.
where? - Serbia.
I've got a Netjet waiting for you at the local airport.
I hate Serbia.
but at least I'll get some work done on the plane.
lost?
cut myself.
going to medical.
you're about 12 floors off.
what does Amanda have on you?
what does she have?
she has my loyalty. She's always had it.
you're the traitor here, and traitors die.
what's happening? - I don't know.
what the hell's going on out there?
it was Baker in the server room with the candlestick.
baker, really? Dude had skills.
I never liked him.
guy was a douche bag.
you should call Nikki, tell her the good news.
is it green for Amanda?
we're at 72%.
so the mole is down, but the chip is active?
correct. - Where are we at?
72%. - Minutes, Alex.
B, how many minutes?
five, six?
five or six.
is it five, or is it six? - Nikita, look.
she's out of pocket.
change of plan. She's on the move.
we're on the move. Damn it.
you're too close. - We can't lose her.
that's strange.
the weather inside Division hasn't changed at all.
that's good, right?
I mean, there's been no refresh in the data, no update at all.
deactivation. - It's done. - It's done?
you're safe.
Nikita, chip is down.
we're green to strike.
it's Nikita.
how did she？
activate chip kill chip offline.
what are you doing?
they're shooting at us.
wait!
grenade!
Anne, stop.
do not kill her.
are you okay?
my arm's stuck.
Nikita, just go.
no, the tank's gonna blow.
I know, I want you to live. Just go, please.
I am not going. - I love you. Damn it, just go!
I love you.
we gotta go, it's gonna blow.
magnificent.
Gustav Klimt, from his Vienna years.
it's in excellent condition.
the previous owners took great care in its handling.
and the thieves who stole it from the owners last week?
those gentlemen are very meticulous.
rest assured, we don't consort with garden-variety criminals.
we only represent the elite.
all works for sale come complete with forged provenance papers, and if art isn't your fancy, we have goods in the back.
guns, black market technology...
Oh, I'm not the buyer.
my employer is.
I'd like to introduce you to him.
Mr. White.
be back in a minute.
okay, Angela's office is in the southeast corner.
did you get her phone? - Yes.
it'll transmit an encrypted I. R. code that'll help you get past the security reader.
Owen, buy her some time.
copy. - Excuse me?
these are copies, right?
of course not. What kind of operation do you think this is?
I'm realizing why Percy gave him a job that required no human interaction.
Owen, get it back.
compliment her.
clearly one of a kind... just like your dress.
Thanks.
Nikita, you better hustle.
I don't know how long Owen can keep this up.
almost there.
the safe's in the floor.
two minutes. - Acknowledged.
two minutes. How's Owen doing?
like a puppy trying to catch a butterfly.
which is why I've always loved Chinese food.
no. You're losing her.
engage. Ask her a question.
you want to...
you want to grab dinner some time?
No! No, don't ask her that.
let me check my schedule.
are you--...
can you tell me more about this painting?
I think I could make a deal...
Nikita, time's up.
I'm in. - Okay.
you're looking for a flash drive.
my phone is missing. Do a sweep.
all units, lockdown protocols.
locking down.
Owen, be prepared to exfil by force.
I'm so sorry.
I ran into a rather tiresome countess who I haven't seen since art basel Miami.
boring, boring.
I did find this in the ladies' room.
do I leave it with you, or...
thank you. It's mine.
Mr. White, we do have that engagement.
Yes, of course.
nice shirt.
I know, it got a little rough. - Contact, engage, escalate.
make contact with the subject, engage their attention, and escalate their interest. It's tradecraft 101.
we got it, didn't we? - That is not the point.
Michael, we know that Owen has no experience working undercover.
which is why we practiced for this.
what happened to "Any mission you walk away from is a good mission"?
look, if our source is correct, and Angela is working with the Dirty Thirty, then Birkhoff's gonna find a lot of goodies on this, right?
would it be insensitive if I gave him the finger?
he's just frustrated.
Oh, great. I get to be his chew toy.
michael and I had a certain way of doing things when we were in the field.
it can't be easy for him, watching someone take his place.
the myoelectrics look good. I adjusted the feedback sensors.
should give you more sensitivity.
Thanks.
you get satellite TV on that thing?
cause I'm missing the Redskins game.
what are you doing here?
I heard there was a man down. I had to make sure he was okay.
I appreciate the sentiment.
I heard you've been sleeping here.
don't you want to go home?
it's just been easier being close to medical.
you know, I know a lot of soldiers who have been through this.
they all say that the best thing to do is to get back to a normal routine as fast as possible.
I know.
some of them don't get it, but I do.
it's time to move on.
have you seen Dr. Lester? I need him to
what are you doing here?
well, you guys all need to work on your greeting skills.
I'm here to see Michael.
sorry to interrupt. I better go.
I gotta go see Birkhoff.
look, you haven't seen her in what, a month?
I mean, if she hasn't come around yet, then...
maybe you should let it go.
what do you got?
that flash drive Nikki stole from the art gallery led us to another one of our wayward souls.
a couple weeks ago, Angela took in a shipment of stolen military tech from China.
according to her records, the seller was...
I remember him.
he taught our SERE class. - Sere?
survival, evasion, resistance, escape.
what to do when you're stuck in enemy territory.
so he has a military background.
two tours in the Gulf.
dishonorably discharged when he came home and chopped up some dude with an axe 'cause he thought the guy was tappin' his wife.
bought himself a ticket to death row.
Yeah, and from there to Division.
Yeah, here's the funny thing, though.
he didn't take money for the stolen tech.
he traded it.
traded it for what? - A bunch of stuff.
some basics-- rifles, ammunition
some a little more exotic, like...
shock-sensitive shaped charges, the type of thing you'd find in anti-tank missiles, landmines.
the target could be anything, anywhere.
or anyone.
cast LANSDDWNE, PENNSYLVANIA - Why would I be lying? - I'm not saying you're lying.
I'm telling you, I saw Ray. He was watching me.
Could--couldn't you be imagining it?
I mean, you know how jumpy you get.
okay, but what about the phone calls at night?
a wrong number. - Jason, it's his voice.
it's him. He is following me.
you know that's not possible.
your ex-husband was a lot of things, but he's not a ghost.
Hi, Kate.
No! No!
Kate! Listen to me!
listen to me, listen to me.
everything's fine. I'll explain everything soon, but we've got to go.
you have no idea how long I've been waiting for this.
I'm back, baby.
so Ray was here?
police reports say an intruder broke in last night.
prints at the scene were inconclusive for them, but not for Shadowbot.
it was Ray, for sure. - What'd he do?
kidnapped a woman, shot her boyfriend, an off-duty Pennsylvania state trooper who was lucky enough to still be wearing his vest.
according to his report, he never got a clean look at the shooter.
who's the woman?
Kate Barrett, Ray's ex-wife.
what do we know about her?
married Ray in Texas in '04.
after he Lizzie Bordened that dude and went to prison, she petitioned the state for divorce, moved to Philadelphia.
she's been laying low ever since.
no old photos, anywhere.
she was trying to leave her previous life behind.
Oh, this is good.
it means we have a shot at keeping this quiet.
I don't think so.
young woman taken from the arms of her cop boyfriend by her supposedly dead husband?
Hello, People magazine, do I have a cover for you.
if this story blows up, questions will be asked.
questions that lead to Division.
we won't let that happen. - Or what?
what, am I missing something?
if people find out that Ray's death was faked, Division could be exposed.
the President herself has told us that she will not allow that, - meaning- - Division gets wiped out.
Yeah, I'm a cleaner.
I know how these things work.
what are you doing here?
FBI. - Yeah, the men told me.
what I want to know is what the Feds want at a local crime scene.
who are you?
lieutenant Jason Decker, Pennsylvania state police.
that's the boyfriend, the one who got shot.
lieutenant, we believe that your suspect is someone we've been hunting.
he's wanted in the abduction of several women, all in different states.
I don't think so. I know who did this.
you do? - Kate told me her ex-husband's been stalking her.
you're mistaken. We've gone through the file.
miss Barrett's ex-husband was executed by the state of Texas six years ago.
I know, I know, that's what I've been telling her.
but some--some mistake must have been made.
a misidentification, a clerical error.
she told me he'd been following her, even calling her at home.
she probably was being followed.
just not by who she thought.
look, this is not uncommon.
she's been through a traumatic experience in the past.
now that this new threat has come up, her mind jumps to the first thing that scares her, - her ex-husband.- I don't know.
you were shot during the attack.
took three in the vest, right? - Yeah.
what are you still doing on the case?
I was placed on administrative leave.
Yeah, but--you shouldn't even be here.
right?
she's my girlfriend.
if you're suggesting we look for a dead man, you're clearly not of much use.
perhaps you're right about your suspect.
all right, you got him off the scent, but keep him close.
don't need him talking about his dead man theory to anyone else.
lieutenant, we do need someone to help us coordinate with state police, and you obviously know this case better than anyone.
officially, you would be special advisor to the FBI.
it'll keep you in the hunt.
how is this possible? How are you here?
it's a long story, but just know
know--that I was serving my country.
I never wanted to leave you.
ever! I didn't have a choice.
the people that recruited me, they wouldn't let me contact anybody.
ray, you've got to let me go. - What?
I don't know where you've been or how you're here, but that part of my life ended a long time ago.
see, you don't understand.
it'll be exactly like it used to be.
like it used to be?
like when you would threaten to kill me if I looked at another guy?
I've changed. I can prove it. - Stop the car.
you're not listening to me! I did this for you.
I did all of this...
okay. - Everything, for you!
michael looks good... considering.
he's getting better.
and Nikita? How's she?
okay.
it's been rough on her.
well, it's hard to watch someone you care about get hurt.
Yeah, it is.
good thing she's tough enough to handle it.
some people would have just bailed.
is that what you think I did?
I think you made an ultimatum, and then headed for the hills.
an ultimatum.
that's what you got out of that?
most people would have- - most people would have what?
left their friends when it got too tough?
I didn't leave anyone behind.
it was the only way to get you to understand.
I was thinking of you, of your safety.
by running away from the fight?
you're not hearing me.
I've never run from a fight in my life.
until you left Division.
where are we going?
I just need to collect a few things.
I'm hungry.
meal
can I get a pop?
just stay where I can see you.

Hello, hello.
our missing chica's ATM card was just used at a storage facility in Western Pennsylvania.
can you get me eyes?
security cam's online.
he's taking off.
there's only one road away from that facility.
no way on or off it for a while. If he makes it to the highway, though, we could lose him in all the traffic.
can we send a team out there, cut him off?
at the rate he's going, he'll make the highway in 20 minutes.
fastest we could get a team out there is 1/2 hour, minimum.
Nikita, we found Ray.
he's on an access road near Brookville.
only in 20 minutes, we'll lose him on the interstate.
we can't scramble another team in time.
you and Owen are the closest to the scene.
we'll never get there.
you're gonna clue in the cops?
Nikita, you can't let them get to Ray.
it's one thing if we scrub records.
it's another if a dead inmate is sitting in front of the authorities in the flesh.
Yeah, I know, but the state troopers are the only ones with the resources to close that road in time.
we need them.
lieutenant. - Excuse me.
we need you to set up a roadblock.
you have access to a chopper, right?
we set up roadblocks at both ends of the road, but he never reached them.
so we closed in and found his car here.
any other vehicles go through? - No.
anyone approach it?
they've been told to wait for you.
wait here until we signal you.
once we get Ray, we've gotta keep him out of sight.
where are they?
could he have doubled back on foot?
no, the troopers would have seen them.
we got a car, no Ray.
what's Ray's training in again?
survival expert.
Percy used him for missions in hostile environments.
deserts, jungles- - forests?
Nikita, Ray was not on that road to get to another destination.
that road was his destination.
here? Why?
because... He's in the woods.
Allegheny National Forest. 1/2 million acres, spread out across two states.
police begin a search in the morning.
Yeah, why don't you ask them if they can also find the Boba Fett figure I lost in second grade.
they got about as much chance of finding that.
the tree canopy makes satellite imaging useless.
what about thermal?
sure, if you want to check out every bear in the woods.
this is Ray's home turf.
he can survive there indefinitely, which is why he was stocking up on supplies.
actually, Owen versus bear would be pretty sweet.
we do have one lead.
Birkhoff recently analyzed the phone calls made from Kate's phone.
a few of them pinged off a cell tower near the area.
the tower's coverage radius intersects part of the forest.
that narrows our search area.
which gives us the jump on the police.
you two are the lead team.
alpha Two runs support, but the priority remains the same:
get Ray, and get him first.
you came on too strong with Decker.
Nikita had him hooked. You almost lost him.
but we didn't. - It's not always about the immediate.
when you work a cover, it's about leaving no questions behind.
anything else? - Yeah.
your diction could use work.
my father trained me in forest survival.
I could lead the support team, help navigate.
you're still benched. - I am on track with my rehab, and I know you could use the help.
it's already covered.
did you get anything from the maps?
the guy's got SERE training, right?
so he's gonna want an area with clear sightlines, probably on higher ground.
if he's thinking long-term, he'll need access to fresh water.
okay. Team two is gearing up.
we leave at first light.
what are you doing?
I'm joining the fight. Sit and watch.
you've been pretty tough on Owen lately.
no, he's making it tough on himself.
