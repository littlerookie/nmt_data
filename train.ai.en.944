here you go, chief.
soon that won't be a problem.
the mayor wants to clean up this neighborhood. It's election year.
no more riffraff, no more scammers.
if you're not up to code, you' out of business. No exceptions.
we're gonna sweep across the citylike a big, blue wave.
purses are for my friends in Armenia. No Prada there. It's legal.
that's not why I'm here. - Really?
no, I-I could care less. The other day, maybe, but not now.
reading? - Compliance.
we need to make sure you're up to code.
otherwise, you're out of business; the police are cracking down.
don't you need, like, a license on the wall or something?
Yes, I also need an earthquake kit and to floss more.
you really don't know everything, do you?
the wave! The wave you saw.
that's what Ronny called the police sweep that's coming.
like I told you, I'm a little fuzzy.
I should get a refund. That one was really for you.
I don't remember you paying. - Okay, whatever, but I'm here now to help you.
how noble. You're so giving. - Fine.
you're awesome and I need you.
now, what do we do to make sure you don't get shut down?
it's not that difficult. Relax.
there, up to code. Feel better?
that's all you have to do?
I keep it in drawer most of the time; bad for business. People like to believe.
okay, this is more thanjust "for entertainment purposes," right?
it's real for you.
entertaining for me.- There you go. Win-win.
okay, can I get a... - Still fuzzy.
okay.
Hey, Ike.
are you okay?
what happened? - Ask your boyfriend.
am I early or something?
did you, um, did you talk to my neighbor Ike at all today?
the guy with the motorcycle shop. - Oh, Ike.
Yeah, the neighbor who drives you crazy.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did see him.
And? - We had a little chat.
about the parking thing.
my guess is, I don't think there'll be any more problems.
did you beat up my neighbor? - No, of course not.
I gave him a quick shot, bam, that was it.
you can't just beat up my neighbor! This isn't high school.
you're offended? - I'm horrified!
so it's okay to talk to your landlord, but not your neighbor?
you didn't beat up Mr. Rose.
I wonder what kind of favoryou did for your buddy, Mr. Private Plane.
I don't think we should have dinner tonightor, or any night.
not a problem, Bloom.
hit "set.
then the number.
then "enter.
and what if it takes me longer than 20 seconds to get out?
security is coming, and I called for an armed response.
great.
so how did you know that Ronny was still...
a jackass? - Yeah.
well, I'd like to say it was fatherly intuition, but...
but what?
remember when I picked you upin that parking lot that night?
you know what I saw?
um, my Bel Biv Devoe pin?
I saw a punk who didn't give a crap about you.
and any kid that stupid...
he ain't never gonna wise up.
so, hey...I made copies of your new keys.
wait.
you keep one.
what's with the parka?
aren't you hot?
I'm fine.
why don't you just take this off?
cause I don't feel like it.
so this has nothing to do with your principal?
trust me.
it's not about him.
I need Ronny's number.
Why? - This punk stole my bike.
sorry, dude, Ronny and I are no longer in touch.
awesome.
you finally have an exthat's useful to me, and you dump him?
gee, Cyrus, that's too bad. Had I known your bike were about to get stolen...
I still would have dumped him.
well, just give me the number.
just...why not?
fine, you're not dating.
Emily!
you're the medical examiner?
Mr. Rose?
I'm sorry, Mr. Rose...
...but I cannot state conclusively...
...that the cause of death was natural.
your daughter, she...
excuse me, Father?
father Moore.
you'll have to come with me.
father Moore! -Will you plead guilty?
tell us about the exorcism! -Over here, Father Moore!
we're at Crescent County Courthouse. We show you Father Richard Moore...
what about the parents? -They're not talking to the police.
do we charge them?
no. Even the priest admits he ran the show.
we need a Christian on this.
preferably a Catholic.
somebody that knows this shit inside out...
...and who the public will see as unbiased.
we're going after a holy man here.
Ethan Thomas.
he's not Catholic, though. Methodist, I think.
but the guy practically lives at church. Choir, teaches Sunday school.
he's no choirboy in the courtroom. I've seen him tear people up.
he's a shrewd son of a bitch.
all right, pull him off whatever he's doing. He's lead prosecutor.
there's ambition. She never stops. She even works while she drinks.
gentlemen, you know Erin Bruner. -Of course.
hello. -I was so sure Van Hopper would fry...
...but you proved me wrong, lady.
the system worked, that's all.
gentlemen, you'll excuse us, will you?
have you seen the news about this priest?
I heard something about an exorcism gone bad, but I don't know the details.
the DA charged him with negligent homicide.
they offered a very reasonable plea bargain, but the priest turned it down.
do not ask me to take this
the archdiocese specifically requested you.
why me? -They followed the Van Hopper trial.
they think you're smart...
...and convincing.
they want you to ask the priest to reconsider.
well, what if he won't?
this sounds like a quagmire. If I'm smart, I'll leave it alone.
Erin, the Van Hopper case got you back on the fast track.
once again, you're a rising star.
Chivas, neat, please. -Tanqueray martini, dry.
what are you saying? -I'm saying, you do this for me...
...and the rising star keeps rising.
the case is yours.
and just how high do I get to rise this time?
I've been junior partner for too long now, Karl.
it's not like other firms haven't called. -Erin
I want my name on the door, right next to yours.
okay.
try to get the deal.
if the priest won't and this goes to trial...
...the archdiocese feels he could be an embarrassment.
so under no circumstances is he to testify.
no, of course. If I'd put Van Hopper on the stand...
...He'd be marking time on death row instead of sunbathing in Miami.
his tab.
good morning, I'm Erin Bruner.
may I sit down?
they brought the chair for my public defender.
I guess they left it when they decided I wasn't going to kill myself with it.
my firm represents the archdiocese.
Yes.
Yes, I was expecting them to send someone.
why did they choose you? -I wanted this case.
so you like the spotlight? -I'm used to it.
I defended James Van Hopper.
and now you've come to further your celebrity.
no.
I'm here to make senior partner at my firm.
are you a Catholic? -No.
I'm an agnostic, I guess. I'm not really sure.
if you're not sure, then you are one.
I don't think you're the right attorney. I'll stick with my public defender.
he can't get the DA to get you a better deal. I can.
I won't be making any plea agreement.
if you don't, the archdiocese won't post your bail.
you'll be stuck in here for the trial.
do you understand how long they can put you away?
it's been explained to me.
the DA's office doesn't like it when religion holds itself above the law.
and this prosecutor, Ethan Thomas?
you're gonna need somebody hungry and smart...
...and aggressive to even have a chance.
what would your strategy be to defend me against such a formidable man?
that depends. -On what?
on how you wanna be defended.
what's your main concern, other than staying out of jail?
ls it how you're being portrayed? -I don't care about my reputation.
I'm not afraid of jail.
what I care about is telling Emily Rose's story.
I want people to hear what only I can tell.
and what is that?
what really happened to Emily...
...and why.
if I let you defend me...
...will you promise to let me testify and tell the truth about what happened?
and what is the truth you would tell? That the ritual killed her?
was it your fault she died? -No.
all right. Then I'll let you tell her story.
but only if you agree to let me do whatever else it takes to win.
you're not used to this kind of place.
I'm sure our life is very strange to you.
not so strange.
I grew up in a little town.
but our house wasn't as nice or as big as this.
my mother, she raised me alone.
she was a schoolteacher, so we had very little money.
what a wonderful thing to be.
that was Emily's dream, to be a teacher.
that's why she went away to the university.
a lot of cats live here.
there are...
...1 1 now, I think.
Emily always brought them home.
ever since she was a little girl, she couldn't leave a stray abandoned.
before these troubles began...
...was Emily a happy girl?
Oh, yes.
before she went away to university...
...my Emily was so very happy.
what is going on--? Girls!
mama.
is it--?
it's a scholarship, Mama.
they pay for it. They pay for everything.
this is your dream, Emily.
you'll be leaving us.
it's okay.
I'll be okay.
I'm gonna show this to your father.
counselor. Thanks for meeting me. -Sure.
can I buy you a drink, Mr. Thomas? He makes an excellent martini.
just water for me, please.
so...
...the judge thinks we should offer a new plea agreement.
she feels the community might be better served without this trial.
how do you feel about it?
personally.
my job is to represent the interests of the people...
...and make an effort to be objective.
I ask because I know you're a churchgoer.
now you're set to prosecute a man of God.
your priest broke the law...
...and a young girl is dead.
if he's a man of God, then, personally, I think he's even more subject...
...to the laws of moral behavior. If it were up to me, he'd get no deal.
and forgiveness and compassion? Isn't that part of your creed?
or does that just get in the way of your work?
if you have compassion for your client...
...you'll persuade him to accept this:
charges reduced to reckless endangerment.
twelve months in a county jail.
reducible to six, plus probation, if he stays out of trouble.
somehow I expect he can manage that.
but please understand me. If he refuses, I will seek the maximum.
father Moore has made it clear there will be no plea agreement.
he will not lie or admit to something he is not guilty of.
and he was never neglectful of Emily. -"Never neglectful"?
have you seen the postmortem photographs?
we'll go to trial. My client wants the public to know the truth.
good.
so do l.
have a good night, counselor.
let the record show that the defendant and his counsel are present...
...and that the jury is seated.
Mr. Thomas, you may begin. -Thank you, Your Honor.
good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Ethan Thomas.
I'm the assistant district attorney, and I represent the people.
in the case before you, the evidence will show...
...that the victim had a serious medical condition that demanded treatment.
we will prove that the victim's condition rendered her physically...
...and psychologically incapable of caring for herself.
her care...
...was then wholly entrusted...
...to that man, the defendant, Father Richard Moore.
she became his responsibility...
...and he betrayed that responsibility...
...By persuading her to abandon her medical treatment...
...in favor of religious treatment:
a ritual exorcism, performed by the defendant...
...allegedly to cure the victim by ridding her of demonic forces.
we will demonstrate that this course of action...
...directly resulted in the victim's death.
I said a moment ago that I represent the people.
we all know what that means, but it's a little abstract, isn't it?
miss Bruner, the attorney for the defense...
...is seated right next to the man she represents.
and I stand here to represent the people.
that's not really why I stand here today.
I'm here on behalf of someone who can't sit at a table...
...and look at you every day and gain your sympathy...
...someone who can't take the stand to testify...
...and tell you what happened in her own words.
a young girl...
......that could've been your daughter.
could've been mine.
a girl who trusted Father Richard Moore with her life.
this is what she looked like...
...before the defendant began his religious treatment.
this is a photograph taken of her on the day that she died.
I stand here for Emily Rose...
...who died horribly...
...at age 1 9.
you won't be able to see Emily sitting here day after day during this trial.
but I hope you'll remember her as she was when she was alive...
...and full of...
...hopes and dreams.
and as she was when Father Richard Moore was finished with her...
...and left her to die.
thank you.
is the defense prepared to make its opening statement?
I'd like to reserve my opening statement......until the presentation of the defense's case.
as is your privilege.
prosecution may begin.
that was already my plan.
thank you, Your Honor. The people call Dr. Edith Vogel.
I've known Emily her entire life. I took care of all of the Rose girls.
can you describe Emily as you knew her growing up?
she was a bit sickly in her early years.
she stayed inside a lot, reading, learning music.
how did she feel about going to school?
objection. The witness is not a psychiatrist.
I'll rephrase. Did you talk to Emily about going off to college?
Yes. She told me she was excited...
...but nervous that she would be away from her family in the big city.
this was an overwhelming change for her.
did you stay in touch after she went away?
Yes. She wrote me a letter saying that she'd been to a dance...
...and she'd met a boy named Jason.
she didn't want her mother to know this...
...because her mother did not approve of dancing...
...and had warned her about the boys at school.
did Emily communicate with you again last fall after you received the letter?
actually, it was her mother.
she telephoned me...
...waking me out of a deep sleep at 4 in the morning.
she asked me to call Emily at a payphone on the university campus.
when Emily answered, she was quite hysterical.
at first, she just sobbed uncontrollably.
but eventually she calmed down enough to tell me what happened.
she said that she was alone that weekend.
her roommate had gone home.
she had awakened...
...and thought she smelled something burning.
there was no alarm, but she got up...
...afraid there was a fire.
Dr. Mueller, what's your position at the university hospital?
I am chairman of the Department of Neurology.
and after you heard about the dorm-room incident...
...what were your initial thoughts?
at first, I thought perhaps Emily had taken illegal drugs.
some type of hallucinogen.
but we ran tests and found no trace of drugs in her system.
and the more she explained the incident to me...
...the more I began to suspect something else.
epilepsy results from uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain.
in a severe, or grand mal, seizure...
...a person may lose consciousness for several minutes...
...and suffer involuntary contractions of all the muscles of the body.
is it possible for a person suffering such a seizure... to have hallucinations or perceive the things that Emily described?
the muscle contractions could feel like an extreme pressure on the body.
and it is certainly possible, with all that brain activity...
...for a person to perceive all sorts of strange and violent things.
so suspecting that Emily was epileptic, how did you proceed?
I administered an electroencephalograph.
what did the EEG reveal?
it showed a possible epileptic focus in the patient's left temporal lobe.
did this require a specific treatment?
Yes, I began a medication schedule for Emily with the drug Gambutrol.
I also advised regular follow-up examinations and further tests.
but Emily failed to keep her follow-up appointments with me.
she gave any reason for discontinuing these appointments?
Yes, she told me she was convinced that her condition was a spiritual one.
it was the conviction of her priest, she said, and she shared his beliefs.
was it your impression that Emily had placed her care...entirely--? -Leading the witness.
sustained.
after the end of October...
...did you ask Emily why she had stopped...
...filling her Gambutrol prescriptions?
Yes. She said that Father Moore had suggested she stop taking the drug.
and what, in your medical opinion...
...was the result of Father Moore's suggestion?
I believe Father Moore's suggestion killed her.
objection, Your Honor!
the witness is asserting outrageous conclusions based on pure hearsay.
technically correct, but I'll allow it as part of his expert opinion testimony.
thank you, Dr. Mueller.
your witness.
you said you observed a possible epileptic focus in the temporal lobe.
doesn't this imply what you observed may not have been an epileptic focus?
Yes, that's also possible.
would Father Moore's advice to stop taking Gambutrol be good advice...
...if Emily were, in fact, not epileptic?
of course. But that's not the case here. She was epileptic.
really.
when Emily saw objects move on their own...
...and felt an invisible presence on top of her...
...was she experiencing symptoms typical of epilepsy?
not typical, no.
are they typical indications of any other conditions?
say, for example, psychosis? -Yes, I would say that's correct.
but isn't psychosis an entirely different medical condition from epilepsy?
Yes, in my-- -So aren't you selectively choosing...
...what parts of Emily's experiences fit your epilepsy diagnosis...
...while ignoring those which indicate something else?
objection. Argumentative. -Withdrawn.
no further questions.
we have to work fast.
they're only giving me an hour with you tonight.
listen.
before we get started, there's something I have to tell you...
...something I should've said to you before I let you take the case.
okay.
there are forces surrounding this trial.
dark, powerful forces.
just be careful, Erin. Watch your step.
I see.
look
father, you don't have to worry about me.
I'm an agnostic, remember?
demons exist, whether you believe in them or not.
your involvement in this trial might just open you up to their attacks.
look, Father, I appreciate your concern...
...but you need to be worried about yourself.
Ethan Thomas is using the medical aspects of this case as ammunition...
...and I have to be prepared for his attacks, so...
...with what little time we have, I think we need to focus on your defense.
now, what I need from you is more information about Emily's condition.
specific details of how it progressed after the dorm-room episode.
well, after the first incident...
...she was sent to the university hospital for testing and observation.
Emily once told me that in her dorm room, she resisted the demons...
...but at the hospital they overcame her.
so she believed...
...that her possession began at the hospital?
Yeah, I think she did.
and after that, things just went from bad to worse.
Emily!
Emily?
Oh, my God. Emily?
don't touch me.
Jason, please...
...don't leave me.
and I never did leave her.
I stayed until the end.
so much of what we shared was like a nightmare...
...but I wouldn't give up a single minute I spent with her.
she woke me up, you know?
to things I never felt before, things I never knew I could feel.
I never knew how dead I was until I met her.
residential north metro district where James Van Hopper...
...acquitted after a controversial trial...
can you turn that up, please? -...has apparently struck again.
it was inside this quiet suburban home...
...that police say James Van Hopper murdered a young couple today.
sources close to the investigation say that Van Hopper...
... who was acquitted of murder charges in April...
...may have known both of the victims.
their names are being withheld pending family notification.
most glorious prince of the heavenly army...
...holy Michael, the archangel...
...defend us in battle against the princes......powers and rulers of darkness.
counsel Bruner, my courtroom day begins at 9: 30 a. m.
I'm sorry, Your Honor, l-- -Which was 1 7 minutes ago.
ready to proceed?
Yes, Your Honor.
Dr. Briggs, please state your qualifications for the court.
I have advanced degrees in medicine......psychiatry and neurology from Johns Hopkins...
...and I have had three books and several dozen papers published......in the fields of neurology and neuropsychiatry.
what was the cause of death, as determined by the autopsy?
the decedent expired due to a gradual shutdown of the bodily functions.
why did her body shut down?
the autopsy found that it was a cumulative effect...
...from numerous physical traumas exacerbated by malnutrition...
...which severely inhibited her ability to recuperate from those traumas.
in other words, her starving body had little or no means to recover...
...from the injuries it was sustaining, and so it eventually just gave out.
how did Emily get these injuries?
some were the result of violent epileptic seizures...
...and some were self-inflicted.
and why, in your opinion, did Emily injure herself...
...and why did she stop eating?
upon review of her complete medical file...
...I concluded that Emily's epilepsy had evolved...
...into a condition known as psychotic epileptic disorder.
this is a rare development, to be sure...
...but one that I have witnessed numerous times.
Emily was epileptic and psychotic? -Yes.
explain how this psychotic epileptic disorder would manifest itself.
the seizures would have the symptoms of schizophrenia...
...such as auditory and visual hallucinations...
...and sometimes extreme paranoia.
the seizures may lock up the joints and slightly contort the body.
the pupils will dilate, making the eyes appear black.
so you believe that Emily had epilepsy...
...which developed into a form of violent psychosis...
...a condition that can be controlled with Gambutrol?
Yes. And it would've been, if she'd continued her treatment.
in your opinion, if Emily had continued with her medication...
...would she be alive today? -Absolutely.
if treated early, psychotic epileptic disorder is rarely fatal.
I mean, this
this was a very sick girl.
the defendant should've realized that Emily was in need...
...of continued medical treatment.
thank you, doctor. Your witness.
doctor, you testified that Gambutrol could've controlled Emily's condition.
how do you know that?
it's the inevitable result of taking the drug.
it would've controlled her seizures...
...which were the root cause of her psychosis.
but wasn't Emily still experiencing psychotic symptoms...
...even after she started taking the medication?
Yes. Because Gambutrol has a cumulative effect.
it takes time to build up in the system.
you assume that Gambutrol would've helped her, but you don't know.
it's a reasonable assumption, but...
no, of course, I can't be certain.
doctor, is "psychotic epileptic disorder" a common medical term...
...or did you just make it up?
well, I distinguished and named the
so psychotic epileptic disorder is really your own pet theory?
objection. Argumentative. -Sustained.
when Emily chose to stop her medical treatment...
...what do you think should've been done?
upon recognizing her condition...
...I would have tranquilized her and force-fed her.
and then, if necessary...
...I would've treated her with electroconvulsive therapy.
electroshock treatment. You would've done this against her will?
to save her life?
Absolutely.
nothing further.
the witness may step down.
your Honor, I offer into evidence this photograph as People's Exhibit 3-A.
and having done so, the people rest.
the photograph is entered into evidence.
we are recessed until tomorrow morning, 9: 30 sharp...
...at which time the defense will give its opening statement...
...and call its first witness.
I'm sorry I was late.
I didn't get a lot of sleep. Big power outage knocked out my alarm clock.
lt won't happen again. -No, I didn't sleep either.
what kept you awake?
doesn't matter.
you're under attack.
what are you talking about?
you're in a spiritual battle, Erin.
the forces of darkness are trying to keep you away from the light.
don't let them.
don't worry about today. We're doing fine.
we're getting creamed. I can't believe I walked right into that.
look, if we don't find a doctor to testify that Emily...
...wasn't epileptic or schizophrenic or schizo-epileptic, we're gonna lose.
care of the city's main branch and the university library...
...I bring you another dozen fun-filled books...
...about the demonic and the mentally deranged.
they burned women at the stake......during witch hunts for being possessed.
glad you don't have to defend those guys.
how are we on our medical experts? -Not good.
the psychiatrist you wanted is tied up in another trial.
and the neurologist is sailing to Costa Rica.
this book I'm reading, it's by an anthropologist.
it's about contemporary cases of possession, mostly in the Third World.
people there are still primitive and superstitious.
maybe.
maybe they see possession for what it really is.
maybe we've taught ourselves not to see it.
you saying you believe in this stuff? -No.
maybe we shouldn't just try to invalidate the prosecution's case...by punching holes in the medical approach.
maybe we should also try to validate the alternative.
validate possession in a court of law? -Yes.
okay. I guess we could bring in some priests to talk about exorcisms
no, the archdiocese won't let us do that.
they wanna limit the Church's exposure to Father Moore.
I've got three articles by the anthropologist who wrote this book.
she approaches the subject of possession......from a scientific perspective and doesn't try to debunk it.
you want me to track her down? -Yeah.
keep looking for a medical expert to refute Dr. Briggs.
but send the case file to this Dr. Sadira Adani.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
...as you know by now, my name is Erin Bruner...
...and I represent the defendant, Richard Moore.
Mr. Thomas has contended that Emily Rose suffered...from a serious medical condition...
...that required medical treatment, nothing more.
he has asserted that any attempt by my client...
...to help Emily by anything other than medical means...
...was not only inappropriate, but criminally negligent.
I'm now gonna ask that you keep an open mind...to what our evidence and testimony will show.
medical treatment was not the answer for Emily...
...because she simply did not suffer from a medical condition.
she was neither epileptic nor psychotic.
Emily Rose's condition, in fact, was demonic possession.
an exorcism was her only hope for a cure.
some of you may find yourself unable to reconcile Emily's beliefs...
...or those of the defendant with your own.
you may not believe demons exist. You won't have to.
because you will see that after the utter failure of doctors to help Emily...
...Father Moore simply tried to help Emily in a different way...
...using an approach that he, Emily and her family firmly believed...was her only chance for relief.
and we will show that despite his greatest efforts...
...and his sincere love for Emily...
...there was nothing he could've done to prevent the death of Emily Rose.
are you okay?
aren't you gonna eat anything?
she said it was terrible to hear the clinking of spoons and forks.
she was always hungry, but she said they wouldn't let her eat.
who did she mean by "they"?
the forces that were in control of her.
that were inside her.
you know, the demons.
tell us what else happened that night.
I walked her back to her dorm...
...and she seemed really nervous and scared.
so I held her for a while, trying to calm her down.
I fell asleep, but when I woke up, she wasn't beside me.
Emily?
Hey.
can you hear me?
I called her father, and he told me to bring Emily home.
Jason and I put Emily to bed...
...hoping she would sleep.
and when did Father Moore become involved?
Emily stayed home after that.
she didn't return to school, and she kept getting worse.
eventually, when she didn't get better, we called our priest, Father Moore.
when he arrived, I sent my daughter Alice upstairs...
...to see if Emily was awake.
Emily?
can I come in?
our Father, who art in heaven-- -Emily?
father Moore is here. Can you come downstairs?
as it is in heaven.
give us this day our daily bread...
Emily, can you hear me?
let's get her off the floor.
Alice, no!
you've suffered a terrible loss, Mr. Rose. I know this is difficult.
so thank you for being here today.
sir, do you often read the Bible?
Yes, I do. -So do l.
what about the DSM?
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders...
...commonly referred to as the bible of abnormal psychiatry.
have you read that? -No.
so you're not aware that according to the DSM...
...a person's refusal to eat is a common indication of anorexia?
objection. The witness just said he hasn't read the DSM, Your Honor.
sustained. -Mr. Rose...
...are you aware that catatonic rigidity...
...specifically a locking up of the body's joints...
...is a known symptom of psychosis?
no. I haven't studied these things.
have you ever visited an insane asylum...
...or a hospital for the mentally ill?
once. My aunt was in one before she died.
Really? So there's a history of mental illness in your family?
I suppose.
sir, if you saw someone eating insects...on a street corner, would you say that that person is mentally ill?
probably, yes. -So can you say with confidence...
...that the behavior you saw in your daughter's bedroom...
...could not be the behavior of someone suffering from psychosis?
I don't know. She never had any problems like that before.
it just didn't feel that way to me or to Father Moore.
and you trusted him, right? -Yes.
he is our parish priest.
fair enough. And after that night, would you say that you...
...Put your daughter entirely in Father Moore's care?
Yes. We had done all we could.
we said she was in his hands now...
...body and soul.
thank you. No further questions, Your Honor.
thank you, Mr. Rose. You may step down.
the defense calls Dr. Sadira Adani.
I am currently a professor of anthropology and psychiatry...at Northwestern University.
where did you receive your education?
at Yale, and then at Cambridge.
and what is your specific area of expertise?
I study the spiritual experiences of people in various cultures...
...and the physiological and psychological changes......they undergo during these experiences.
would it be accurate to say that you specialize in the study of possession?
Yes. "Possession" is one term for a basic human experience...
...reported by a great number of people all around the world.
in my fieldwork, I've seen many people who experienced...
...a sense of being invaded by an entity from the supernatural realm.
why do you think Emily was invaded?
why did this possession happen to her?
based on my study of the case file...
...I believe that Emily Rose was a hypersensitive.
a person with an unusual connection...to what Carlos Castaneda called "the separate reality."
Hypersensitives are born different from everyone else.
they can have visions of the future, or see the dead...
...and sometimes be uniquely susceptible...
...to invasion by an entity that is alien to them.
objection.
on what grounds?
I appIied for assistant coach here but you sort've wouIdn't even give me an interview.
you're the girIs' voIIeybaII coach.
Yeah, but I just had a good meeting with
coach Van Scoyoc at Norway High.
Norway? Yes, sir.
and since this is my Iast year here,
I'm taking a job in St. Louis...
so, you want to go coach basebaII at another high schooI for the two months that you have Ieft?
assistant coach.
don't you think that's a pretty unusuaI request, Mr. Stock?
Yeah. But it's Norway.
aII right. Go ahead.
Hey, Kent.
coach, I thought this was just supposed to be a practice.
it is.
Wow.
did you bring that stopwatch, Iike I asked? Yeah.
what's that for?
weII, I just thought I'd take some notes.
here you go, Coach. Thanks, Bigo.
we're gonna take infieId now, just Iike before a reaI game.
I want you to watch carefuIIy and I want you to time it.
time the infieId, check.
aII right, Iet's go, infieId!
now.
bring it on.
come on, now, Brent.
go wide!
one on the end.
bring it in, boys!
under nine minutes, wasn't it? 8: 24.
aIways keep it under nine. AIways take it first if you can.
what eIse did you notice?
weII...
here you go, Coach. Thanks.
it was perfect.
you took something off those ground baIIs, but...
Why?
because the other team is watching.
we make it Iook nice and easy, and we're aIready in their heads.
you got it? Yeah.
OutfieIders, Iet's go!
the Norway Tigers have spent the last three days wondering if the rains would ever let up.
they finally did today, allowing the Tigers a rock solid start toward a second straight state title.
they pounced quickly, did the Tigers, as Jim Van Scoyoc, their manager, watches.
Kevin Stewart slapped a double down the line.
here comes Steve Meyers, he'll score easily.
west Bend couldn't get out of the third inning as Norway's...
vries allowed two hits in the first and collared the Bulldogs the rest of the way.
norway hasn't given up a run in the playoffs and the senior hurler tossed a shutout on just 43 pitches.
the Tigers move to the 1A Finals, winning it in five.
well, today's victory puts the Tigers in the championship game for the ninth time in the last 10 years.
we ain't the biggest, or the fastest or even sometimes the best, but no one's got the fundamentaIs down better than our boys.
every IittIe Ieague coach within 50 miIes of here is an exNorway pIayer.
it's Iike having our own minor Ieague feeder system.
norway basebaII tradition is as rich as Iowa soiI.
we grow baII pIayers here Iike corn.
heII, 80%% of this game is defense.
the most important thing to understand is these boys take a great deaI of pride in knowing how to beat you.
it's how they get remembered.
and that's how we're gonna win State.
coming to you live from Colonel Stadium, this is KZIAZ 102. 9, the voice of Iowa baseball.
north Tama with the rally going.
looking to upset the Norway Tigers and deny them their 19th state titIe.
long drive to right center!
time, bIue!
and out comes Iegendary coach Jim Van Scoyoc to taIk to his senior pitcher,
brent Fitz, who definiteIy Iooks to be tiring.
how you feeIing, Brent?
I'm good. That was a Iucky hit.
I'II keep it down.
weII, the thing is KimmeI's on deck.
he aIready owns you, so we need to get this next batter out.
don't you buIIshit me, now.
I'II get him, Coach.
aII right, this kid's a deadpuII hitter.
off speed, Iow and away, he's gonna puII a grounder to short.
now, you tighten your beIt and Iet's get him.
come on, buddy, get him now! Let's get it going!
one more! One more!
here we go, Brent! You're aII right, kid! Come on now!
there's a drivel
deep Ieft fieId! Fitz going back!
it is a foul balll Oh, my.
six inches to the right and Tama's got the Iead!
Fitz is clearly on the ropes, all of his pitches are up in the wheelhouse.
come on, Fitz! Let's go, baby, Iet's go now!
let's get this guy! Just Iike we taIked about!
you know how!
ground baII to short.
out!
and the Norway Tigers are the State 1A BasebaII Champions for the 19th timel
that Iast pitch, how'd you know?
I scouted the hitter.
when? In my spare time.
coach, you don't have any spare time.
I made some. They deserve it.
so the Norway Tigers win their 19th State Championship and their 12th under Jim Van Scoyoc.
from a town with a population of just 586, a high school with only 101 students, these players grew up watching their older brothers, relatives and friends win state titles.
finally, it's their turn in the sun.
we are honored and proud to present this trophy to Norway High School and to all the people of Norway that have supported us through thick and thin.
Yeah! Yeah!
mostly thickl
let's do it again next year and make it an even 20l
Yeah! Yeah!
Matthew, we did it again, didn't we?
do you ever get used to this?
Oh, we don't take anything for granted around here.
we're so gratefuI for basebaII, and so proud of the boys.
of course, they don't have to Iive with Coach
grumpy aII through the season.
he speaks very highIy of you, by the way.
he does?
Oh, bye. There you go.
is it true HaI Trosky once hit a baII that went aII the way out to the raiIroad track?
that's what the oId timers say.
I mean, that's what, 500 feet?
heII, son, that was the Iongest home run in history.
that baII traveIed 200 miIes.
see, he hit it out of the park right over there.
it took one bounce on the highway
Ianded on a freight train that was going by and ended up in Chicago.
Yeah.
Oh, we had a good run, didn't we?
thank you for Ietting me be a part of it. I Iearned a Iot.
you're a good coach. Boys Iike you.
there's a bunch of them coming back next season.
what about this rumor that Norway's gonna cIose and merge with Madison Community?
it'II never go through.
I can't imagine why anyone wouId want to destroy something that means so much to these kids.
Yeah.
Kent, Norway is basebaII.
anyway, if I don't get home soon,
Chic's gonna feed my dinner to the dog again.
how about you? You eat yet? There's aIways pIenty.
no, I'm good. I'd just Iike to stay out here for a IittIe whiIe Ionger.
couIdn't have done it without you, Kent.
sure, you couId.
weII, I wouIdn't have wanted to.
I'II see you next season. We'II go for an even 20.
coach, I'm not coming back next season. Oh, that's right.
Yep. I got a job in St. Louis, whoIe deaI.
see what big city Iife's about.
that's too bad. The game couId use more peopIe Iike you.
no, no, everything's right on scheduIe, sir.
Yeah, the inspection's on Friday.
you're aIready preapproved for the Ioan, so aII we need is for the bank to accept the appraisaI.
and then it's just a formaIity.
right, right. WeII, I'II caII you as soon as I hear anything.
okay? Have a great night.
Mitch!
Mitch!
Mitch, what are you doing?
Hey, how many times have I toId you not to do that?
seven.
eight, if you incIude right now. What do I win?
you think it's funny?
after what those things did to your mother's heaIth?
dad, I can't stay in there and Iisten to your reaI estate B. S. 247, okay?
I'm getting some air.
weII, my reaI estate B. S.
is what pays aII the biIIs around here.
one of these days you're gonna have to make a Iiving yourseIf.
okay, when I work, I'm gonna work to Iive not Iive to work. Okay?
you think I Iike working aII the time?
mom sure thought so.
Hey, Iike mother Iike son, right?
you know what? Why don't you go pack a bag?
what for? You'II find out when we get there.
okay.
why don't you pack two?
'what do I win? "
the way I see it, it's a winwin proposition.
Madison's all for it.
what about the baseball team?
Oh, I cannot wait to hear thisl
bigger opportunity because of a Iarger schooI system.
now that's the part that don't figure, Mr. Makepeace.
if you cIose Norway High and merge it into Madison, what happens to our basebaII pIayers? What happens to Coach?
it's a free market system.
they have to compete Iike everybody eIse.
cream rises to the top.
didn't you puII your son out of Norway because Coach Van Scoyoc wouIdn't Iet him pIay basebaII and footbaII at the same time?
weII, now, that's got nothing to do with this.
the schooI board's responsibiIity is educationaI.
sports programs come secondary.
how do we win here, Harvey?
lower taxes. PIus, kids Iike your boy, Kevin, get a better opportunity for education.
norway's got a 16to1 studentlteacher ratio and Madison's got 22to1 .
how's that better?
we sent two sons and a daughter to this schooI and they're aII on the dean's Iist in coIIege.
you take away our schooI those kids won't be shopping in our store.
we'II Iose our business.
and we're not the onIy ones.
what about our IocaI economy?
weII, I can't address any issues except the educationaI ones.
why the heII not, Harv?
MiIIie and Lou's store's been a part of this town for five generations.
there's more at stake here than cIosing a schooI.
nobody said anything about cIosing the schooI.
no, not yet you haven't. You'II get around to it, won't you?
weII, I mean, even if it does happen, you're aII gonna make out Iike bandits.
the agreement offers aII kinds of financiaI incentives.
let Miss Hudson here expIain this to you.
Yes, the state gives $3, 000
to each IocaI schooI district per student.
now, Norway wouId retain a percentage of that aIIowance without incurring any of the educationaI expense.
wouId someone pIease transIate that into EngIish?
she said the state is wiIIing to bribe you to the tune of $3, 000 a kid for cIosing down the schooI.
you reaIIy think you can pIace a vaIue on something Iike that?
weII, changes in state budget reguIations are favoring the Iarger districts.
if you don't Iike the Iaw,
I wouId suggest that you take it up with the IegisIature.
weII, you know there's no time for that.
perhaps you're out of your Ieague.
I guess I missed the announcement that Des Moines has made the majors.
let's just be fair here.
the state has its job to do but you stiII aII have a right to be heard.
Matthew?
Harvey's right. Anyone who opposes this merger can fiIe a petition for a feasibiIity study.
but it'II take 20%% of the eIigibIe voters' signatures.
how about your signature, Matthew?
you gonna sign it so your boys can keep pIaying for Norway?
I didn't think so.
I'm done taIking to these peopIe.
I'm not. I want to hear more about that petition.
I'II waIk home.
good night.
you don't reaIIy beIieve aII that numbers crap, do you?
Yes, I do.
the State's heIped over 100 schooI districts with simiIar agreements.
and how many of them have 19 state basebaII championships under their beIt?
is that what this is aII about?
this team beats the biggest schooIs in the state year after year.
at basebaII. But what about at Iife?
they'II have better opportunities in the reaI worId if they have more resources at schooI.
you don't get it, do you?
kids in smaII towns Iike Norway, they have something speciaI.
if they want to pIay basebaII, join the band, run for student counciI, they just do it.
nobody gets Ieft out. Everyone participates.
and you cannot teII me it's Iike that in aII the big schooIs.
don't teII me how to do my job.
I'm not.
maybe you couId get a different job.
how Iong do I gotta stay for?
you're enroIIed in the high schooI tomorrow.
mom, Dad, Iisten, got no ceII service or I wouId've caIIed.
great. But Iisten, I'II expIain everything.
let me Iook at it. Wait. Wait for it. Come on.
first team AII State.
how are we gonna keep you down on the farm now?
come on, man. Look at this guy.
Oh, you guys are gonna kiII them again next season.
Yeah. Thanks.
but pIaying for who, Madison? Does it matter?
I'm not pIaying for Madison.
no way. I can't imagine pIaying for anyone...
Hey, guys, guys, guys, guys. Hey, Iook at this kid.
CameIs. ID?
I Ieft it in my Jag.
you better go get it.
are you kidding?
denied.
did you see that Johnny Rambo jacket?
what are you Iooking at?
CameIs. ID?
I Ieft it in my tractor.
Steve, your perspective is off on this.
get your trigger on there, get a good finish, it'II be aII right.
look who it is.
you're Iate.
I'm taIking to you, son.
I'm new, so cut me some sIack.
I just did.
I know your dad.
sungIasses back, pIease.
we don't do Iate around here. Whatever.
you're Iate again, I'II fIunk you.
why don't you take a seat over there?
right in the back of the cIass.
don't cry.
what's wrong with that kid?
Dennis, Dennis, can you hear me?
Dennis, stay... Can you hear me now?
hoId on...Dear Father...
no, it's not my phone.
I'm in Bumfart, Iowa.
...thank you for the food...
Dennis, I need you to take care of this.
...and for your wonderfuI bounty. HoId on, hoId on, hoId on.
hoId on, hoId on, hoId on, hoId on, hoId on, I'II get it. Stay.
it has to happen by tomorrow. Amen!
Dennis, can you hear me? Amen.
Amen.
what's wrong with the phone on the waII?
it's a rotary.
dad, this is technoIogy. It makes my Iife a Iot easier.
what did you think of Coach Van Scoyoc, Mitch?
van Nazi's more Iike it.
I don't see what the big freaking whoop about him is.
he's a farmer.
that " farmer " was my coach, too.
not to mention the nationaI coach of the year.
you might try Iistening to him. You might actuaIIy Iearn something.
something important.
supposed to Iearn that stuff from you.
sorry, Mom.
you didn't find anything funny in that, did you, Mitch?
no.
maybe you wanna throw a IittIe " ma'am " in after that.
no, ma'am.
don't you have something to do?
she made you come out here, didn't she? Shut up.
I don't know what I'm doing wrong, Dad.
you were a bit rowdy in your day, too.
that was a Iong time ago.
when I got you out of jaiI?
one time.
you were naked.
it was caIIed streaking, Dad. In an oId age home?
it's pretty innocent compared to what Mitch is getting into.
I just thought that bringing him here wouId be good for both of us.
then why are you Ieaving?
because, Dad, I'm not a smaII town guy. You know that.
I'm more big city.
how's that working out for you?
weII, I can't run my business from here, so I don't know what eIse to do.
sorry I have to dump him on you Iike this.
weII, nothing we can do about that now.
Jared!
we'II Iook after him.
Jim, you and I basicaIIy want the same thing.
how do you figure that, Harvey?
weII, you want what's best for the town, so do I.
sometimes you just have to ride the horse in the direction in which it's going.
Harvey, I get the uncomfortabIe feeIing you're trying to put something where I don't want it put.
okay, here's the deaI.
I Iet you finish out that contract of yours, which takes you to the end of June.
then I transition you to Madison to the industriaI arts position, which, mind you, currentIy doesn't exist.
and my team?
Oh, your boys get to pIay one Iast season of Norway basebaII, but without you, without the " save our schooI " petition your wife is circuIating, and without your big mouth.
I think that just might go a Iong way toward making the transition to Madison easier for this town to understand.
if anybody asks me something, I teII them exactIy what I think.
you know, you teII the truth, Harvey, you don't have to remember what you said.
are we done here? Looks Iike.
you have no idea what you're trying to kiII.
thanks very much. Thank you.
Hey, Kent. Coach.
I didn't reaIize your truck couId make it this far.
Hey, don't badmouth my truck.
what's up? Oh, nothing. I...
just thought I'd stop by and see if you stiII had that IittIe notebook of yours.
you drove 250 miIes just to ask me that?
weII, I thought you might be interested in what's been going on up in Norway.
see, they're not gonna Iet me coach anymore.
they're kiIIing basebaII.
there's a big town meeting next month. You might want to be there.
now, we ain't the biggest or the fastest...
norway baseball tradition...
we grow ball players here... 80%%% of this game is defense...
anyway, think about it, wiII you?
you know, those oId timers say that basebaII's the onIy game on earth where the object is to get home, Kent.
Mitch, company!
Mitch, Patrick and Richie here want to pIay catch with you.
catch? Yeah, okay.
Richie? Patrick.
Patrick. Richie.
Richie. I don't pIay basebaII.
try this on for size, Mr. " I Don't PIay BasebaII. "
he was an aIIstar, straight up through CoIt League.
he used to send me pictures.
go on, get out of here. PIay some baII.
you shouId come out for the team.
not with that dictator.
man, Van Scoyoc's a great coach.
Yeah, I heard Iike a biIIion times.
you wanna see me pitch? Knock yourseIf out, kid.
you got a Iive one there, don't you?
is that as hard as you can throw?
no.
how oId are you? Fourteen.
Fourteen? You shouId try out for the softbaII team.
you'd give them heII.
who do I...
who do I see about getting weed around here?
go get the baII, Richie.
there's some ditch weed right by the barn.
get the baII, Richie. It grows wiId around here.
get the damn baII, Richie!
okay.
I don't want you taIking about that stuff in front of my kid brother, okay?
what's the big deaI?
cause we don't do that crap around here and I don't want Richie getting any ideas, aII right?
you got it?
listen, you stupid hick, nobody asked you to come around here and pIay baII with me.
Yeah, they did.
come on, Richie.
Richie, come on! See you, Mitch.
I know some of you are concerned about Norway Iosing its identity, especiaIIy when it comes to our sports teams.
so it's been decided that, for one year, our scores wiII be reported " MadisonlNorway. "
what? What?
B. S. Yeah.
a Norway student's never gonna be abIe to participate in Madison.
not with farm chores before and after schooI and a 20miIe drive to and from.
Yeah. That's right.
the Madison basebaII coach is never gonna start a Norway pIayer.
not even a good one.
do you reaIize how much shit he'd catch for that?
Yeah.
and how about the average pIayer? He's got no chance.
so you teII me again about aII this opportunity you keep pitching us?
so what exactIy you teIIing us, Harvey?
you saying this is a done deaI?
Yes, I am.
what? Wait. We have aImost 400 signatures.
that's 90%% of the eIectorate! 90%%!
right here.
right here.
four hundred. Four hundred, Harvey.
weII, thank you for that, Chic.
that represents a Iot of hard work on your part.
we've got the signatures. The merger is postponed.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Sam?
you had 30 days to fiIe this with the State Board.
we're the SchooI Board, Chic. I'm sorry.
what? What the heII?
you didn't teII us that Iast time. Did you just forget?
or did you convenientIy Ieave that part out?
do something, Pop.
I'm afraid Sam is technicaIIy right. The petition is invaIid.
let's go, boys.
just so everyone understands, you aII are going to go into a cIosed session with the Madison SchooI Board and vote against the wishes of this entire community based on a minor IegaI technicaIity?
it is the duty of this board to represent the best interests of this community as we understand it.
does that seem fair to you, Miss Hudson?
it's the state's position that smaII schooIs are a financiaI burden and aims to consoIidate as many of them as possibIe.
Wow.
excuse me.
Mr. Stock? Can I taIk to you?
you did your taIking in there.
listen, I'm not the enemy here.
then who are you?
I'm someone doing my job.
now Iisten, I know that this is a Iot of change aII at once but you need to Iook at the bigger picture.
this is what is best for this town and what's best for this schooI.
this schooI is aII the town has.
have you even been to the other smaII towns that have had their schooIs ripped out from under them?
no.
then how can you say it'II be better for us when you haven't gone back and checked for yourseIf?
I guess that's not part of your job, is it?
no, it isn't.
I'm afraid you don't know what you're taIking about.
I chaIIenge you.
go back to those towns and have a Iook for yourseIf.
it's not her fauIt, you know? I know.
some of it is.
can I take out the truck? " May I " ...
where do you want to go? I don't know. I'm just bored.
weII, when you have somepIace to go, Iet me know, I'II drive you.
what's he so upset about?
can't seem to get past the fact that Iife isn't aIways fair.
he took the truck.
life's gonna get more unfair.
I'II pay you Iater!
how you doing?
loving Iife. ReaIIy? Because I heard you were bored.
get out of the truck.
keys?
let's go see what your grandpa has to say about this.
when you're done with that, grind the feed, feed the pork chops.
CycIe of Iife. In one end and out the other.
I don't think I'm bored anymore.
sure you stiII are.
trust me.
he's got a big mouth. I warned him.
you know what? We don't bring him back for the rest of the season.
so you're going to canceI the season?
what, and Iet them go out as martyrs?
without Van Scoyoc coaching them, they go out as Iosers.
the sooner this Norway basebaII tradition ends, the sooner we get the merger behind us.
what do you know about this Stock guy, the assistant?
he's from BeIIe PIaine.
he fiIIed in haIf of Iast year when Van Scoyoc's guy moved on.
he coach baII at BeIIe PIaine?
VoIIeybaII.
Exceiient. He's got a big mouth, but he'II do.
grandpa's got me working hard, pretty hard.
weII, you couId maybe take some of the heat off if you found yourseIf something to do besides steaIing trucks and smoking cigarettes.
get yourseIf a hobby.
or something. You know, anything.
where is Grandpa?
he's down there.
smoking a cigar. StiII thinks I don't know.
don't teII your grandma, you know, she thinks I gave them up.
I hate it here.
I want to go back home.
you know, I had this sergeant at Fort Bragg and he said something to me once, stuck with me.
'even the easy things are tough if you do them haIfheartedIy. "
he actuaIIy said " haIfassed, "
I'm just cIeaning it up a IittIe.
'I hate this, I hate that, I'm so bored, " you know.
stop whining.
you're just making things tough, you know.
put your heart in something.
Hey!
I know it's been tough on you guys since your mom passed.
it's aII right. It's okay.
you're supposed to feeI this way, you know.
your grandma thinks that you need a hobby.
something you can put your heart in, you know.
not this here.
what kind of hobby? WeII, son, she said that you'd figure it out.
you know, she's a smart woman.
why I snatched her up.
she toId you to come out here, didn't she? No.
shut up. Come on.
okay, she did.
coming! Hang on a sec.
Hi. Hi.
I'm going to go check on some of those other smaII towns.
you are?
no one wiII care that Norway's been cIosed. Those kids wiII be better off.
you don't reaIIy understand aII that much about smaII town America, do you?
I'm from Des Moines.
Yeah.
you had supper yet?
I toId you they were good.
I couId eat Iike three of these things in high schooI.
so, where did you go to schooI? University of Iowa Law.
Where'd you go to schooI? Luther CoIIege.
it's in Decorah. Division Three schooI.
so, you didn't grow up here. No.
what is the big deaI with the high schooI basebaII team?
I don't get it.
weII, here's the thing you have to understand about Norway.
it's Iike being with the New York Yankees.
I mean, they have a tradition here that's about more than just winning.
it's about pIaying the game right.
I guess I just want some of that to rub off on me.
does that make any sense?
this isn't going to work, you know.

Hey.How's it going? We going to DQ?

Hey, Coach.
I'm Mitch. I'm in your industriaI arts cIass at schooI.
Yeah, I remember.
I was just wondering if, maybe, if we couId taIk in private.

Hi. I'm Mitch Akers.
these are my kids, Chad.Hey.
how do you do?I'm Mitch, how are you?
Jean Marie.Hi.
Hi.Nice to meet you.
come on inside.
come on inside.
what's on your mind?
I want to apoIogize for my...
my grandma says I need a hobby.
I had this kid once,
I asked him to Iay down a bunt.
a runner on second, nobody out.
we're down one to Cedar Rapids, big 4A schooI, top of the seventh.
we get our runner to third cIean up hitter's on deck, chances are we tie the game.
dude shouId totaIIy bunt.
he didn't. He swung away.
and you Iost.Nope.
'dude " hit a tworun homer and we won.
and I benched him the next game.
weII, he pissed and moaned for a whiIe, but he got the message.
damn good pIayer, your father.
good attitude, too, eventuaIIy.
I want to go out for your basebaII team.
I'm a pretty good catcher.
I'm not coaching at Norway anymore.
you'II have to taIk to whoever the new coach is.
weII, nice meeting you, ma'am.
I'II see you. Thanks, Coach.Yeah.
it's okay to miss it.
be a whoIe Iot easier if that fieId was a thousand miIes away.
weII, Mr. Makepeace, that just about wraps up my work here in Norway.
weII, you did a heck of a job for us, Miss Hudson.
thank you very much.Thank you.
and don't worry, we're taking steps to deaI with the naysayers.
sir, that's reaIIy none of my business.
we're going to hire a coach who's going to take the team down with him.
faII fIat on his ass.
Mr. Makepeace, there's a Ken Stock here to see you for an appointment regarding the baseball head coach position.
weII, I'II be going.No, no, no, hang around.
this is going to be fun. Send him in.
am I interrupting something?Not at aII, Ken.
it's actuaIIy Kent, Iike CIark.
weII, Kent, congratuIations, we're giving you the coaching job.
great.
I better get going. Thank you.
we've decided our boys from Norway deserve one finaI season.
you know, to go out in styIe.
you're just the man to Iead them.I hope so.
sit down, sit down.Yeah.
it's pretty oId.
it's twice your age, son.
coach Bernie Hutchinson gave it to me when he moved on.
read the name scratched on the end there.
Trosky.
this is the bat that hit the baII that hopped the train aII the way to Chicago?
hai gave it to Bernie, Bernie gave it to me and now I'm giving it to you.
coach, I can't accept that.
no. You got to.
part of the tradition handed down by the gods of basebaII.
you wouIdn't want to piss them off, wouId you?
no, sir. No, I wouIdn't.
weII, you take those kids aII the way, Coach.
Yeah.
there it is. That's him.
he pIayed aII right.
he made the Iast out in the championship game.
Great.Never won the big one.
we're screwed.
what you got that thing set on?Vida BIue.
Where'd you Iearn to hit Iike that?My dad.
what schooI you say you go to?
Norway.ExceIIent.
I'm Kent Stock.
Hi. Mitch Akers.
Hi.
Hey, Chip.Hey, Coach.
I was going to teII you about that.
look, we're missing a bunch of guys.
I was going to teII you about that, too.
weII, we'II pIay with what we have.
we're few but we're not bad.
right.how the heII wouId you know?
somebody say something?
go on, speak up.
some of the guys think you don't know what you're doing, Coach.
you incIuded, Patrick?
coach Van Scoyoc wouId've gone pro if the army hadn't drafted him.
okay. I get it.
Kevin, you're our numberone pitcher, right?
I get three pitches. I hit one out, you shut up about me and start focusing on yourseIves.
there's no way you hit one out.
do we have a deaI?
Yeah, deaI but...Let's do it.
Owen, give me a bat.
aII right, Kevin.Shut him down.
aII right, he's meat, Kevin. Bring it!
here we go, Kevin.Give him something hard.
give me the heat, Iet's go. I'm not kidding.
aII right, Kevin, no puss.
bring it. I mean it.
you onIy get two more.
come on, Kevin.
come on.
no.
okay, Kevin, bring it in.
come on, guys.
lose the voIIeybaIIs.
toId you it was a bad idea.Whatever.
chip! OutfieId! The rest of you guys wiII take some infieId.
Sammy, shag for me.InfieId, boys. InfieId!
coach.
Owen, Fungoe, come on, buddy!
you want me to catch?
no, Steve's got it.Don't I get a shot?
what we need is outfieIders now, aII right? Go ahead and take center.
way to go, Coach.Thank you.
Mitch, remember I need your bat in the Iineup, so don't hang your head.
let's go. Sammy, shagging baIIs, atta boy.
Yes, sir, Coach.
let's go, Iet's get one.
aII I'm saying is a TbaII pIayer has a better chance of hitting a NoIan Ryan fastbaII than our boys have of going to state.
Jim says that Stock kid's bright as a Musco.
I say what we need is a coach, not a big Iight.
never going to be the way it used to be around here.
Hey, Patrick!Hey.
have a seat.AII right, then.
it won't take Iong.Okay.
just want you to know that nobody expects you guys to win anything this year.
not with TyIer and Jim gone, and haIf the boys not coming out.
so don't sweat it.Okay. Great.
Thanks, Scotty.
Patrick...
weII, am I wrong? Things change.
weII, I'm surprised at a Iot of peopIe in this town.
we have so IittIe faith in these boys who have meant so much to us.
weII, you think it'd heIp if we aII said a prayer for them at church?
a good prayer is fine, but there's got to be a IittIe action with it.
you know, it wouIdn't hurt if you started coming back to practices.
let's go, Eddie, bring it home!
get there, come on!
keep it down! Get those throws down, come on, feIIows!
come on, Spitz! Know where you're going with it!
Sammy, back him up! Come on!
that's you, that's you! Get there!
let's go, bring it in!
what is going on?
I mean, what's with you guys?
stands used to be fiIIed when we practiced.
Yeah, now aII we got is that staIker guy.
it's okay, I'm married!
he's a reporter for the Des Moines paper.
and he's baId, that's why he wears his IittIe hat.
aII right. Thinks we're going to faII fIat on our asses.
butts. Sorry, Coach.
even Coach Van Scoyoc thinks that.
no, he doesn't.
Yeah, shut up, Sam.
coach Van Scoyoc took one for the team so we couId aII pIay one finaI season.
aII right, Iisten up.
we decide what happens out here, aII right?
not the papers, not the peopIe in town.
I don't want to hear one more word about Madison and the merger.
we're going to pIay Norway basebaII.
van Scoyoc basebaII, Bernie Hutchinson basebaII.
we do that, no matter what happens, we go out winners.
you got it?
you got it?Yeah.
weII, good! Get out there and Iet's run it again. Come on!
aII right.
Ciao, Coach.Thanks.
see you, Coach.See you.
Hey, sorry, Coach.For what?
the voIIeybaII thing.Get out of here.
see you tomorrow.Pretty funny.
it's not that funny, but it's pretty funny.
here, take that.Thanks, Coach.
looks Iike they're warming up to you.Yeah.
first game's Friday.
if they pIay Iike they practiced, we're dead.
I guess we're going to have to caII it.
we can't pIay in this.
Thanks, guys.
weII, we're back out here tomorrow against Cedar Rapids Kennedy, so get home and get some sIeep.
I'm going to get a beer.
want to come over and watch the game?
no, I'II see you tomorrow.AII right.
good for the corn.
Roger Dempsey, Des Moines Register.
Yeah, I've read some of your compIimentary articIes.
take it easy, Coach. This is what I do.
weII, what I do is get my pIayers over some of the badmouthing they've been getting from guys Iike you.
you know, so they can pIay a IittIe basebaII for their high schooI before going out into the reaI worId and getting crummy jobs Iike yours.
we're being honest, huh? WeII, Iet me teII you something,
I have the best job in America.
I can't pIay basebaII, so I write about it.
and you may not Iike it, but it's aIways honest.
okay.
we'II pick it up again tomorrow. Because I Iove this. This is terrific.
but I got to get back to the office now. My crummy job.
I've even got the Iead for tomorrow, what do you think?
'Cub Coach Kent Stock Irritates The Voice of Norway. "

Hi.Come on in.
just for a minute.
from the bridge. Free.
weII, that's sweet.
I came out here to teII you that you were right.
those smaIIer schooIs that were absorbed by Iarger districts?
their economies were absorbed, too.
they're turning into ghost towns.
weII, did you taIk to the Norway schooI board about it?
Yes.And?
Mr. Makepeace is not interested in statistics that don't support his position.
and he pretty much controIs the board.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.No...
listen, you want to come in and sit down?I shouId go.
but good Iuck tomorrow.
with what?

coach?
do you mind if my kids take infieId first?
they're a IittIe sIeepy from the drive over.
I'd Iove to wake them up so we can give you some good competition.
pretty standard, home team takes infieId first.
Yeah, wouId have been our home game except for the rain and aII.
okay, I guess.Thanks, Coach. Won't take Iong.

you seen this crap? They're ragging on your boys.
when I was a kid, Jim Van Scoyoc was my hero.
I mean, I wanted to pIay baII for him. I wanted to Iearn from him.
I never thought in a miIIion years that I wouId repIace him.
and now that I have,
I can't motivate the team the way he did.
he's a Iegend. You know, I mean, he...
tweive state championships.
coach of the year. NationaI coach of the year.
I was his assistant coach for a haIf season.
and I can never fiII his shoes.
so quit.
no, it's not about quitting. It's about...
kidding, joke.
listen to me.
you don't have it in you to Iet those kids down.

Hey, come here.
my mom died a year ago.
I'm sorry.
she's buried in Chicago.
and ever since then, me and my dad have had troubIe.
it's mostIy me, I guess.
let me ask you something, Sammy. Few big games coming up next week.
a IittIe thin in the pitching department, aren't you?
you're a IittIe thin in the hair department, aren't you?
weII...
Hey, Akers, you're from the big city. HeIp me out a IittIe here.
in your own words, what wouId you say the difference is between
norway basebaII and Chicago basebaII?
you got a cigarette?
that's great, very funny. You're good.
you're baId.AII right!
that's it! I'm baId, okay?
anyone not know I'm baId?
why don't we aII just say, " Roger Dempsey's baId, " and we're not. " Yet!
Yeah, right.
Yeah, yeah. Kids, huh?
what are you so gIum about?
you're 1 7 and 1 2. That's pretty good, considering.
thought you aIways caIIed 'em Iike you saw 'em?
as I saw them. But never mind that now.
look, I was a IittIe hard on you in the beginning.
but I'II be honest with you, I think you have a shot at the state tournament.
off the record?Sure.
we have tired pitching and sIoppy defense.
coach, they aIways hit a patch Iike this every year.
but you know what?
coach Van Scoyoc wouId ease up on them a IittIe.
you've been taIking to him?No.
but Coach Van Scoyoc aIways riding them so hard.
you've been taIking to him?No.
the team he's coaching is coming in on a 35yearoId consecutive scoreIess innings record.
so, that's aII.
so you've been taIking to him?Yes. For that story.
you taIk to him about me?No.
but he's very proud of you and thinks you're doing a great job.
you didn't taIk to him about me?Of course I have.
you'd make a pretty good reporter yourseIf. You know what?
he says you'II know exactIy what you have to do.
what's that, Roger?
you gotta coach to win that Iast game, the big one.
took the words right out of my mouth.
gotta get there first, Chip.
you wiII.
Thanks, Roger.
excuse me, Mr. Dempsey?Yeah, son?
it's okay, my grandpa was baId, too.
Thanks.
but you're fatter.
Oh, boy.
tonight's the night Norway fans kiss high school baseball goodbye.
everybody plays it here and you just can't turn it down.
it's been a tradition here in Norway for as long as I can remember.
and that's pretty near 70 years.
Alex's wife, Dolly, understands as well as anyone what the Tigers mean to the town.
baseball is Norway. Or Norway is baseball.
it's sad for the town.
okay. Next week we go to sectionaIs.
if we can knock off Jefferson today, the numberone ranked 4A team from a schooI ten times our size, we send a message to aII the other schooIs, Norway isn't dead.
now, I know you guys reaIize this but I'm gonna say it anyway.
this is the Iast reguIar season game in this schooI's history.
let's make it count. Bring it in.
'Tigers " on three. One, two, three!
Tigers!Let's go!
you know what? I've got one of those basebaII feeIings, though.
I think Norway's coming back.
wouId this be Iike a whiskey feeIing or more of a vodka feeIing?
you know what? You're biased, Larry.
you're from Madison, come to think of it.
you want Norway to Iose. If they don't Iose, you have a probIem next season.
I know who you are.
and you're not biased?
I'm from the big city, buddy. Des Moines, aII right?
I don't have a horse in this... I don't care who wins this game.
aII right, big city. 20 gets your 40 Norway Ioses.
Oh, I'm so gonna bet.AII right.
you want a piece of this, Father?Stop it.
come on, guys, it's not too Iate!
it's raIIy time!
pitcher's got nothin'!
don't ever do this.

here you go.

Yeah!
Hey, hey! Doesn't mean I want to be reIated to you.
good job, good job, Mitch.
who caIIs a suicide squeeze in that situation?
a Norway coach with big stones. I feeI awfuI about this. AwfuI.
you wanna give me a hit off that fIask?
if you get a cup.
Oh, it's beautifuI.
Yeah.Thank you.
it's a IittIe smaII, though.I know.
it's 'cause it's for me. Come on.
aII right.

Oh, Dad, you know those cigars you wanted me to send you?

Dad...Do something with him.
GiIIett Grove South CIay is 318, Dad.

okay. It's one and done.
forever.
south CIay is 318.
the eight games they Iost were when Reed EIIis wasn't in the rotation.
he's pitching today.
we aII know he's being scouted by pro teams.
but one pIayer doesn't win a basebaII game.
Sammy?
he can if he throws 92 miIes an hour
coach.
we win by pIaying Norway basebaII.
eighty percent of this game is defense.
we don't Iet anything get out of the infieId and we wait.
sooner or Iater, they'II make a mistake.
every pIayer whose ever worn a Norway uniform is out there with you today.
and think about this.
no other Iowa High SchooI basebaII dynasty has ever won a state championship in their finaI season.
we're pIaying for everyone who knows that Norway is a great pIace to come home to.
and no matter what happens today, this time next year, the jerseys you're wearing wiII be poIishing chrome at Madison High SchooI.
so ask yourseIf one question.
how do you want to be remembered?
aII right, Iet's go. Bring it in.
give us the count, BigO.
one, two, three... Tigers!
ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the singing of our national anthem.
Oh, say, can you see
by the dawn's early light
what so proudly we hailed
at the twilight's last gleaming?
whose broad stripes and bright stars
through the perilous fight
o'er the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming
and the rocket's red glare
the bombs bursting in air
gave proof through the night
that our flag was still there
o say, does that starspangled
banner yet wave
o'er the land of the free
and the home of the
brave
thank you very much. Play ball.
I did it!
tigers!
come on, Norway!
now, you be caIm.
me? You stay caIm. Don't worry about me.
and the Norway Tigers take the field looking to secure their 20th title in this their final season, against the heavily favored, senior dominated
Gillet Grove South Clay Spartans.
with senior pitcher Kevin Stewart out of the rotation there's a lot of pressure on the Tiger's junior pitcher, number 29, Sammy Wilson.
let's go, Sammy, huh? Shoot strikes, kid! Shoot strikes!
aII right, now, Redhats! Two down!
out!
weII, so far so good. Three up, three down on soIid defensive pIaying by the Tigers.
nice work!
and that will bring to the mound Gillet Grove South Clay's superstar pitcher, Reed EIIis, a statewide MVP four consecutive years.
Ellis will be attending the University of Arizona in the fall and, according to scouting reports, is a numberone pro draft contender.
kid can pitch.
that boy pitches very fast, huh, Daddy?
sure does, sweetie.
come on, Iet's go.Yeah.
come on now, Eddie!
batter's up.
aII right, Eddie, Iet's go, start us off now!
strike!
strike!
strike three!
this guy's not gonna make the pros, he is a pro.
don't worry, you'II get it next trip.
it's hard to hit an aspirin tabIet, BigO.
Ellis throwing bullets.
chasing the Norway batter out of the box with a 95mileanhour fast ball.
strike!
come on, Sammy, swing the bat!
strike three!
and there's strike three. I know it's scary in there, but you'll never get on base if you jump out of the box like that.
there's no other way to put it. That is pure fear.
come on, Mitch!Come on, Mitch!
aII right, Iet's go!
aII right, Mitch, now!
strike!
two!
strike three!
that's three up, three down. A ninth straight strike from Ellis.
a masterful display.
it's gonna be a Iong day.
aII right, Iet's go, Norway! Defense, come on now!
there it is! Come on now, turn it! Turn it!
tough defensive play by Norway keeping the Tigers alivel
come on, Kev, Iet's hit this guy! Come on now!
that sucker's throwing buIIets.
here we go now! Take a Iook!
come on now.
strike!
strike three! You're out!
eiiis on his game today.
UnhittabIe so far, frustrating Norway.
and now up to bat, Reed Ellis.
Ellis, with a long drive to deep left fieldl
that'll clear the bases. Oh, myl Ellis is an army of one todayl
hoId him, hoId him!Let's go!
don't give in, Sammy, come on now!
and South CIay opens it up with two runs in the top of the third.
underdog Norway just looks stunned at the moment.
time, bIue!Time!
coach Kent Stock, up and out of the dugout and on his way to the mound.
how's your arm?I'm fine.
we're supposed to be out here waiting for them to make mistakes, not the other way around, right?
mow these guys down and Iet's get off the mound, aII right?
Out.Atta way, boys! Let's go!
come on, now, Sam. Keep it down.
Out!Yes!
nice job!
pretty sharp. That's his game, defense.
apparently, Coach Stock's words of encouragement to his pitcher worked.
and the Tigers strand Ellis on base.
do I have to do this by myseIf again? Let's get it out of the infieId next time!
and that didn't sit well with Ellis.
complaining loudly at his teammates.
an outburst like that could get him ejected if he's not careful.
he's gonna hang one for you right now.
how do you know, Coach?Just trust me.
Ellis into the stretch.
and the pitch.
iverson connectsl
it's way backl Deep to right fieldl
goingl Goingl
it is gonel
Yeah!
son of a...HoIy ToIedo!
that's a round tripper for Patrick Iversonl
now we're in it! Now we're in it!
that could be the first dent in Ellis's armor, with Norway finally on the board, or it could be too little, too late.
dude, what are you doing here? Go catch.
Hey, Coach. How'd you know he was gonna hang one?
I scouted him.
folks, this could be it for the Norway Tigers.
bottom of the seventh, traiIing GiIIet Grove South CIay 4 to 3.
a dynasty of 19 state championships in the past 24 years could be about to end.
Sammy?
what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna get on base.
two outs, nobody on, and the Norway pitcher up at bat.
he's 0 for 2 today.
two down, it's aII you!
norway desperately needs a man on base.
but Ellis continues to go hard to the inside cornersl
and number 29 has been on his heels, backing out of the box all day.
brushed back by a 94mileanhour fastball for strike one.
the Norway batter, crowding. Challenging Ellis.
it's gonna hurt, stupid.
Oh, that was closel Just catching the inside edge for strike twol
folks, he is very close to the plate here.
crowding dangerously close now.
Ellis into the stretch.
and the pitch.
that has got to hurt.
a 93mileanhour fastball puts the batter on his knees.
coach Stock over immediately to check on his player.
Ellis now clearly frustrated.
Where'd he get ya?In the back.
give me the bat.
coupIe of deep breaths. Come on.
you wanna pIay?Yeah.
okay. Sam, don't ever do that again.
and he's all right.
the crowd up and applauding the effort.
as third baseman Kevin Stewart comes to bat, trying to keep Norway alive.
Stewart's a . 320 hitter, but his bat's been quiet today.
come on, Kevin, start a raIIy!
you stay caIm now.Me?
strike!
strike two!
norway is down to their last strike.
come on, boy! You can hit this guy!
just stay focused!
and Stewart's out of the box.
some sort of distraction in the stands.
what? He made me come.
it's exNorway coach, Jim Van Scoyoc.
and Stewart's back in the box.
Ellis checks the runner at first.
he's into the stretch.

with a man on first, senior Steve Meyers off the injured Iist up to bat for Norway.
trying to come through in the clutch for the Tigers.

Oh, myl That's itl Here we gol
winning run on third for Norway! Two outs!
catcher, Mitch Akers, a transfer from Chicago, coming up.
his dad played ball at Norway 20 years ago under legendary coach Jim Van Scoyoc.
folks, this is it.
can you imagine the weight on that young man's shoulders?
come on, Akers, be a hero!
akers squares to bunt.
the Spartan infield charges to cover.
strike one.
you don't think Stock wouId caII a squeeze here, do you?
wouIdn't surprise me one bit.With two outs?
two outs, five outs.

I do not beIieve that this is happening.
I Iove you too, Dad.
come on, now. Come on, Iet's go!
akers hits awayl And towards the gapl
Yeah!
took the bunt sign off and had him hit away.
unbeIievabIe.
FooIed me.
FooIed South CIay.
can you beIieve this?
rookie coach Kent Stock has led the Norway Tigers to an unprecedented 20th Iowa state high school baseball championshipl
some traditions just refuse to diel
HeIIo?
Harvey, it's Sam. It was cIassic.
he coaches just Iike Van Scoyoc.
I hate to have to teII you this, but...
they won!
ReaIIy? Yeah, weII, that doesn't change anything.
it sure does change the way you'II get remembered.
see ya, Harvey.
Yes!
it's been a great one, and I've just enjoyed it 100 percent.
I'd like to thank Jim Van Scoyoc for having me as his assistant last year and giving me this opportunity.
this has been a special year for me.
for eons, humans have gazed up at the stars and wondered, are we alone?
you flew me up here on a private jet, Dr. Hodgins. Why?
6 months ago, shuttle pilot Chuck Bradshaw and copilot Jeremy Wren re-entered the earth's atmosphere.
mission control...
looks like all systems are good for re-entry.
bit of a bumpy ride.
makes you feel alive, don't it?
telemetry looks good.
they saw something shoot by, moving at approximately twice their speed.
anchor looks good.
stand by.
shuttle entry's at what, 17, 000 miles per hour?
which puts whatever they saw moving at 34, 000 per hour.
that's fast.
all systems are go. Stand by.
you calling that in?
I think I got my hands full.
you should be picking up speed.
telemetry looks good. Anchor looks good.
Jeremy, I think you should have your hands full, too, if you know what I mean.
expect a little turbulence entering...
astronauts, shuttle pilots, the men who walked on the moon - There's this unspoken rule.
you see something you can't explain, you keep your mouth shut.
Houston?
Roger that. Go ahead.
we just saw a santa claus.
now you're gonna...
hear the silence, man?
they don't know what to say.
this is Houston. That's a negative on the santa claus.
what you saw was a sun spot.
sun spot?
Yeah. A sun spot entering the atmosphere at mach 45? Come on.
what do you want from me, Dr. Hodgins?
I've been called a conspiracy theorist since I was 21.
I'm not afraid of being mocked.
my name is major Jeremy Wren.
and if you're seeing this video. It's because I'm dead.
Why?
because I took this video during my last shuttle landing.
and is major Wren dead?
car accident, two weeks ago.
within hours, this video was on the internet. But here's the thing.
it's been modified.
what they are doing is covering the truth with lies.
what does the pilot say?
Colonel Bradshaw? He did the smart thing. He shut the hell up.
that is, until...
Colonel Bradshaw, do you have any comment on the sudden death of major Wren?
it's a great tragedy.
did you see what major wren saw up there, colonel Bradshaw, or was major Wren insane?
Jeremy Wren was definitely not insane.
since that little slip-up at Wren's funeral, colonel Bradshaw has been fired for alcoholism.
only thing is, he doesn't drink.
so they're after him because he wouldn't call his friend insane on TV?
anyone can see from this video that not only are there beans to spill, Bradshaw is this far from spilling them.
what do you want me to find, the pilot?
no. In fact, he's the one that came to me.
why you?
I have a certain stature in the community of skeptics.
conspiracy theorists.
I want you to find the object.
the sun spot. - It's not a sun spot.
it is an alien spacecraft that crash-landed somewhere on planet earth.
find it. Show it to the world, and Bradshaw gets his life back.
I don't believe in extraterrestrial visitations.
how can you not believe in extraterrestrial life?
I said I don't believe in visitations.
aliens exist.
whatever Bradshaw and Wren saw proves it.
I'm in.
OK! Great!
what do we do first? - we?
Hey, man, the jeffersonian forensics lab has gone dark for a week while the federal coroner is on vacation.
so, I'm all yours.
all right. I need to talk to colonel Bradshaw.
that's impossible. He's in hiding.
Colonel Bradshaw, Walter Sherman.
it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
do you believe that ultimate fulfillment can only be found in the arms of a significant other?
there are an infinite number of paths to fulfillment.
the soul is neither man nor woman.
what are you reading?
some ladies' magazine from the eighties.
I'm reading the ancient hindu text of wisdom called upanishads.
I win.
what's up, Timo?
come on in and get yourself a nice cold drink.
what's wrong?
uncle Shad wants to see us.
both of us?
both of us.
probably about your arranged marriage, which is anti-American.
we shouldn't discuss family business in front of you.
it's not our fault if Leo eavesdrops.
I'm pretty engrossed in this book.
I gave Shadrack the 10 grand worth of diamonds.
I'm confident he'll dissolve our engagement.
when?
could be anytime. So just be ready.
so how'd you make me?
rocketeers all look at the sky the way some men look at women.
dead give away. I told you he was good.
in the future I'll keep my eyes on the ground.
do you think it was the footage that got major Wren killed?
I mean, isn't it obvious?
and they are coming after me now, hammer and tongs.
I've been fired. I can't find a job anywhere.
I'm being audited.
my wife just found emails saying I cheated on her.
I'm a totally faithful husband.
all of a sudden, colonel Bradshaw has a history of mental illness and substance abuse?
how do I know you're not really a womanizing drunken crazy man?
I guess you're just gonna have to make your own determination on that count.
was it you that put the footage on the internet after Wren died?
no.
you know who did? - No idea.
it'd be nice to have the original footage.
it disappeared with Jeremy's death.
all right, I'm gonna need to talk to the guy that told you it was sun spots.
mission commander Ed Scanlan.
ed lives here in d.c.
get this-two weeks after the sighting, Scanlan retired and immediately registered an advanced technology patent and became rich.
Scanlan did not get that technology from aliens.
Walter doesn't believe in extraterrestrial visitations.
Yeah, well, neither did I till I saw one zip by me at mach 45.
OK. Thanks for the inside info.
all right. Nothing entered the atmosphere at those coordinates at that time except for the shuttle.
says who?
guy who owes me a favor - Ira Messing.
ira Messing, the asteroid tracker?
Yep. - Ah, he's brilliant.
wait a minute. Why does Dr. Messing owe you a favor?
cause I found a serial killer and a girlfriend for him.
in that order, but not the same person.
none of Messing's radio-telescopes registered the phenomenon.
well, then, you know what that means.
it's an alien cloaking device.
it means that whoever is covering this up can intercept all data from hundreds or radio-telescopes before it gets logged.
how can you refute the mountain of evidence that aliens have visited this planet?
there's no evidence. There's some drawings and a lot of hokum.
what do you think that Bradshaw and Wren saw?
some kind of experimental drone.
we don't have that kind of technology.
well, they hold it back in order to maintain control.
they? - The corporations.
and they decide what we can and cannot have.
the aliens are here, and they control the people you think are controlling everything.
you are totally paranoid.
you are totally paranoid.
you're telling me the forensics lab at the jeffersonian suspects that jeremy wren's death was not an accident?
Mr. Scanlan, you have to admit it's suspicious.
approximately 125 people die in traffic accidents every day in this country.
you factor in that he was agitated, depressed, medicated, sleep-deprived,
I'd say that makes it a near certainty.
either that or he drove into on coming traffic on purpose.
Oh, what, suicide by tractor trailer?
I didn't know Wren well. I doubt he knew my real name.
he just called me mission control.
that's a pretty fancy watch you got there.
what did that set you back, 10 grand?
excuse me?
Plus, you're not even trained as an engineer.
is this guy mentally stable? He has a hard time focusing.
Walter's referring to the fact that you retire and immediately patent a process for manufacturing a super coolant outside your area of expertise?
let's just call it a hobby that paid off.
did you skip Wren's funeral because you feel guilty?
what exactly do you two do at the Jeffersonian, anyway?
I'm a bug and slime expert under contract to the fbi.
I'm in discombobulated objects acquisition.
so, what, you find things?
I call it a hobby that pays off.
I'm done talking to you yo-yos.
you told Wren and Bradshaw they were seeing sun spots.
was that your way of saying "I believe you"?
otherwise you'd have said something more believable.
a meteor. A weather balloon, a chinese missile.
people who've left the planet, seen earth from space, how many of you are there?
messiahs and emperors outnumber us. Why?
Wren is dead. Now they're ruining Bradshaw's life.
both of those men were in that small group like you.
what did Wren and Bradshaw really see up there?
I told them sun spots as a warning.
what they saw was sun spots, gentlemen.
you consider yourselves warned.
Scanlan knows, but he won't tell us.
Hey, you, uh, see goggle eyes over there with the wienie dog?
Oh, the dachshund.
you ever seen him before?
what, the dog or goggle eyes?
Oh, that's not his dog.
how can you tell?
that's a pretty common type of dog.
Otto! Come on, boy!
Yeah! Come here, come here. Oh, yeah. Come here.
did you see him? - No, no one came this way.
Oh, god, he's really fast.
Hi, uh, I have your dog.
Walter Sherman, please.
this is for you.
Hello? - Tonight at 9 p. m.
the lowest level of the parking garage and 863 granville. P-3.
come alone.
that voice was not human.
it was treated.
I got a meeting. You can't come.
well, do you think it's some kind of a trap?
most definitely.
well, what am I supposed to do with otto?
you'll figure it out.
what? No. No, no. Walter?
I never heard goggle eyes grunt once or pant or breathe.
and he outran you?
normal people can't outrun you.
Yeah, I am fleet.
he disappeared without a trace, like he flew away.
so what was goggle eyes?
you've heard of male enhancement?
not in this context.
Walter, what if what you're looking for doesn't even exist?
those astronauts saw something. I can find it.
the video's all over the internet.
Hodgins said that would happen.
he said they would produce so many fakes, the real ones would get buried.
well, I could go on the internet and dig backwards until I find the first one.
like patient zero?
do that.
what's in it for me?
what's in it for you is that walter finds that thing and doesn't go crazy and spend the rest of his life gluing macaroni to tin cans.
and 200 bucks in your car fund.
I'm in.
don't do anything until I get there.
you won't get here in time.
in time for what?
I have to step into a trap in 20 minutes.
wait, did you say trap?
if anything goes wrong, talk to Hodgins.
but don't get into is car.
it's claustrophobic.
I'm here. What's it gonna be?
that's an impressive party trick you got there.
could we hustle this along?
I know you're not gonna kill me, otherwise you'd have done it this afternoon.
Mr. Sherman.
Hello, Mr. Sherman.
I'm Pope.
don't speak. Just nod if you can understand me.
do you know who I am?
that's very good news for you.
better?
Mr. Sherman, you have a unique and valuable ability.
you've found things for very powerful people, who'd do anything to help you.
I need you to understand that none of that matters now.
no one can help you.
no one can help me.
finding things is all well and good when indeed those things have been lost.
Mr. Sherman, you should concentrate on what I'm saying.
not everything that is missing is lost.
some things have been hidden, and some of those hidden things are not to be found.
they should never be looked for.
I'm the person who hides those things.
you're my opposite.
Yes. We're at odds in our life's journeys.
the yin and yang, if you like.
but it's not a competition.
I've already won.
you have a lovely home in Florida.
it's sunny. Your toys.
a vault of souvenirs and treasures. Oh, your friends.
I wonder how much you'd miss all that if you had to spend the rest of your life here.
I'll destroy the lives of everyone around you.
the little Gypsy girl will rot in jail.
the U.S. Marshal will be disgraced.
your family might disappear altogether.
because, Walter, I hide things.
and I hide them very well.
the thing about well-hidden things is you never actually know if they're gone.
it's very painful.
I want you to remember that.
remember this - I found you.
well, this would never have happened if you had your minder with you.
my minder?
how indelicate.
I'll destroy the lives of everyone around you.
how many fingers am I holding up?
all of them.
how long have I been gone?
3 days.
Isabel has every U.S. Marshal in the country looking for you.
how did I get here?
robot voice called me and told me where to find you.
turned out to be your own bed.
this is why we have to confer before you take a job.
was there anal probing?
only metaphorically.
it wasn't aliens.
it was a woman named Pope.
we need isabel.
so we got a man with goggle eyes, who can shove cars with one hand, whistles through his nose, shutter island, and a hider named Pope.
did I miss anything?
the threats.
are you sure this actually happened, Walter? It sounds insane.
they aren't only scaring Walter, they're making him look crazy.
Walter is crazy. I mean that in a good way.
goggle eyes moved a car with one hand.
obviously an alien.
he didn't really move a car.
it's a parlor trick. That whole meeting was staged.
well, this pope lady doesn't sound like she's bluffing.
if she wasn't bluffing, walter would still be locked in that psych ward.
are you gonna keep looking?
Walter never stops looking.
maybe it's time I tried.
if I don't stop looking, they're gonna ruin Isabel's career, destroy Hodgins' life, throw Willa in prison forever, and do something awful to my family.
you have a family?
what are they going to do to me?
Pope didn't threaten you.
Why?
they want Walter to think I work for them.
excuse me, geriatrics, you always say Walter will die if he doesn't find what he's looking for.
what, like a bloodhound?
die, or go catatonic.
it's a theory.
I gotta stop.
Pope wasn't messing around.
these people - who do they think they are?
for centuries they've been hiding the truth, and for centuries brave men and women have defied them.
Merlin, Jesus, Galileo.
Tom Hanks.
I hate them.
I have a young son. A baby.
and what I'd like at the end of my life is that for the man that he will become to respect me for pushing back on the veil of darkness.
I'm sorry you people don't feel the same way.
don't not look because of me. I'm a Gypsy.
if they catch me, they can't hold me.
we are not a part of their world.
you've got the most to lose.
Yeah. you.
if you die or go crazy, how am I supposed to enjoy being the attorney general of the united states of America?
you find it and you come tell me exactly what "it" is.
my wife and child are gone. They can't touch me.
but if that woman put any doubts in your mind, you tell me now.
I got no doubts, Leo.
besides, if pope locks me away in the loony bin, you're the one that's gonna come get me out.
what do we do first?
I want to catch up to Hodgins, get him to give me a lift back to D.C.
Yeah, that footage is everywhere now.
that's what they do. It's classic disinformation.
the just flood the internet with altered video.
and the truth gets buried in thousands and thousands of lies. But don't worry.
I got my top computer expert working backwards in the postings to find the most accurate version. The truth.
I don't care about the truth. What I'd really like is my life back.
they won't allow that.
they need the world to think that you're a hopeless, crazy drunk.
look, my choice is to live the life they left me or end up like Jeremy.
I choose a crap life over no life at all.
you can stop looking.
Walter doesn't do that.
that's not my problem.
how's it going?
there's an internet behind the internet made up of cached information.
it's been archived and erased but not destroyed.
there's a difference between erase and destroy?
Oh, yeah. It's like chasing a ghost through a hall of mirrors.
Where'd you learn to do this?
I used to be the ghost.
patient zero.
more like patient 1, 000, but it's the closest I've seen yet.
it's got a bit more detail.
you still can't tell exactly what the thing is.
send it to Walter.
and good job.
that's it?
it looks like all the thousands of other videos on the internet.
this is only 3 or 4 generations from the original video that was posted the day wren was killed.
that's fantastic.
what do you want from me?
help us find the truth.
what truth?
guys, this is the real world. Ok?
you cannot win with these people.
Wren is dead. Bradshaw is ruined. For what?
the truth.
you keep saying that as if the truth was real.
Scanlan's saying there is no truth, just another layer of lies.
give us a hint.
you're staring directly at the sun.
that's a good way to get blinded.
my advice to you - Avert your eyes.
Thanks.
thanks? What are we. - Thanks for what?
we've been looking in the wrong direction.
they wiped the official records clean.
the linked video is the only evidence and it's nearly useless.
we have to avert our eyes, look to the peripheries.
OK, here's earth. Look to the periphery and you get what, the moon?
well, yeah. That's brilliant.
I was being sarcastic and snarky, not at all helpful.
what else happened in space that day?
I'll check the jeffersonian space page, but I'm just gonna point out that space is a mighty large ballyhoo, so a lot happened.
on the day of the shuttle landing, the following events took place in outer space.
the constellation leo re-enters his den.
russia fails to contact a stranded mars moon probe.
that sounds suspicious.
it's too much periphery. Keep reading.
a storm on jupiter enters its 348th year.
tinkerbell 4 communications satellite sustains damage from space junk.
a crater on the moon - Wait. That's it.
the damaged satellite.
tinkerbell 4?
OK, whatever Bradshaw saw was crashing.
crashing by definition means smacking into something.
OK. All right. Then what do we do? We're just gonna call up the tinkerbell company and ask them if a flying saucer hit their satellite?
I need a uniform.
does this museum have anything more current than the civil war?
this company insured tinkerbell 4.
satellites are insured?
it's a matter of public record.
you know who really runs things, right? Insurance companies.
of course they do.
Oh, man, I was kidding, but you think it's true.
where there's an insurance claim, there's an adjustment report. Paperwork.
don't worry. The secret here is to pretend like you belong.
I'm not scared, just... If we step through that elevator and, you know, it all goes bad, I just want to say, I have dreamed of doing this my whole life.
now I'm... Just... Thank you.
it's an insurance company, not the. - Not the secret pentagon moon base.
Yes. Here is the insurance report on the loss of tinkerbell 4.
Geosynchronous. Elliptical orbit, one of 24 satellites that stellarcom insures.
our payout was a flat $8 million.
may I ask your interest?
it's a little embarrassing, actually.
we think we might be to blame.
OK. You are air force.
and you're... - Can't really say.
so nsa.
gentlemen, you're off the hook.
the official cause of the damage to tinkerbell 4 was space junk.
well, it might have been space junk. - Our space junk.
both the air force and various space agencies from around the world have assured us that whatever damaged tinkerbell 4 is unidentifiable.
do you think that we could take a copy of that report?
run our own analysis?
if we find liability, we'll reimburse stellarcom for their payout.
you're from the military. And the government.
and you want to take responsibility for something you may have done wrong?
I find that really hard to swallow.
gentlemen, you make me proud to be an American.
thank you.
it's a pleasure to serve my country.
timo. - What?
look, I know you gave uncle Shad those earrings, but you can never pay him too much respect.
what is this?
it's my life savings.
just take it. It's a grand.
have a good day. - You, too.
uncle Shad. We're here.
like you asked.
timo and Willa.
it does my heart so good to see you two together.
you got an insurance report under false pretenses?
at least it's not a felony.
Leo, I got to wear Chuck Yeager's uniform.
he's the first guy who broke the sound barrier.
impersonating an officer - 6 months federal prison.
told you.
hope whatever you got is worth it.
we got the position the satellite was in when it got hit.
we also know the speed of the object and the position and velocity of the shuttle.
we do a little math and krunk-a-doodle-do, we know where the object hit mother earth.
OK, good. Gotta go.
it's $1, 000.
it's a small gift, from us.
Where'd you get it?
I saved it.
it's from her work.
these are wages?
what's the family coming to when I'm taking wages?
why don't you want to marry Timo?
she thinks of me like a brother.
I'm asking Willa.
timo thinks of me as a sister.
well, you're gonna have to find a way to change your feelings.
a couple of weeks ago Timo brought me diamonds as big as your knuckle.
the boy did that so you'd let him pick his own wife.
is your employer the end of the world?
ends of the earth.
uncle Shadrack.
pleased to meet you.
and you as well.
I did not ask Leo to come here, uncle Shadrack.
it's all right. Leo can hear this.
as head of the family, I have made my decision.
you two will be married within the year.
was there anything else you wanted to discuss?
can I ask why?
Willa is growing away from the family.
she will finish her probation with you, then come back to the family and marry Timo, and you will be nothing but a memory.
I need Timo tonight, so maybe you want to take willa back to the end of the world.
of course, it's not really the end of the world.
it just feels that way some of the time.
you can keep that. On the house.
let's go.
come on, would you please call your extremely hot, extremely smart wife to come do this?
it's just data input. I can do it.
are you afraid of her?
Yes, yes, I am. She built this thing by hand.
OK, here's the insurance company's animated recreation of the destruction of tinkerbell 4.
see that red line? That's the trajectory of the alien spacecraft.
military drone, by the way.
and the satellite goes offline.
now, seconds later, the alien craft - Military drone.
zips by the shuttle...
ends up in the puerto rico trench. That's one of the deepest parts of the ocean.
right smack into the bermuda triangle. And you think that that's a coincidence?
no.
no. It had to have been piloted there.
by someone working a joystick, sitting at a console underneath a mountain in colorado.
by aliens.
aliens who traveled light-years dodging suns, asteroids, and black holes, but were too stupid to avoid a fender-bender with a stationary cell phone satellite?
you believe that humans could do that?
that's why they created the term "human error."
have you ever heard of the term, uh,"alien error"?
no, I think not.
what I need to do is find a way to steal a vehicle that can go deep enoughto get to the bottom of the trench.
and what did you come up with?
there's no vehicle that can go deep enough to get to the bottom of the trench.
so the government can't even get down there? Come on, it's definitely aliens.
you know what? Just take me home.
I need that suit.
Get-walter! That's not yours!
it's at the bottom of the puerto rico trench?
a canyon 5 miles deep in the ocean floor.
Walter, do not steal a submarine.
a submarine can't go that deep.
what can?
a cusk eel.
about a foot long, very ugly.
I'm going to find a cusk eel, attach this camera to its ugly little head, send him down to the ocean floor.
Walter, it's not gonna work.
usually I'm very supportive of your efforts, walter.
but I'm with Isabel on this one.
boom.
she did it! - Who did what?
the Gypsy girl. She found first generation footage. Look at this.
I hate to be a debbie downer, but it looks like all the others.
but, still, it's a major accomplishment.
wait a second. Play that back.
there. What is that? Haven't seen that before.
it looks like a shard or something with shard-like properties.
it's gotta be an alien escape pod.
what we're seeing there is the bumper falling off after some kind of cosmic fender bender.
falling off of what?
a secret super-fast unmanned military drone weapon.
Oh, man.
you both talk like the other one is wack-a-doodle.
and sadly, you're both right.
all right, you're the satellite.
Leo, you're the shuttle.
I'd rather be the flying saucer.
fine. Isabel, your geosynchronous orbit over the equator.
Leo, you're heading for a nice safe landing in Florida.
OK, now, I am an extraterrestrial traveler and I'm heading towards earth.
you smack into Isabel now.
then I whiz by the shuttle and realize I'm in trouble, so I escape, using my escape pod.
no, you lose your marble.
Where's the marble land?
IRA, it's walter sherman.
Yeah, another favor. Same time of day as last time.
I know you found nothing to hit the ground, but did anything burn up before impact?
space junk re-entering.
burned up at 68, 000 feet.
Hey, just for snits and giggles, could you tell me, say, the square mile that it would have hit if it would have hit?
all right, thanks, buddyI owe you.
wow, we can practically walk there from here.
I don't want to be negative, but I don't see how we're gonna find anything in this muck.
Walter finds things.
Yeah, but a meteor could hit in this environment in the morning and all signs would be gone by the afternoon.
I'm sure we'll see some kind of sign.
Yeah, I'm not doing that.
Tin-foil hats? Come on, that's number one on the crazy checklist.
suit yourself, pal.
something scorched that tree.
whatever it was ended up somewhere over here.
what we need out here is like ground-penetrating radar.
I mean, in order to find something, you just...
doc, really? How about a hand?
the chances of finding something out here
Oh, my god. It's metallic.
not a sign of scorching or damage.
I think we found what we're looking for.
what's that writing?
alien hieroglyphics. This is not terrestrial in origin.
I'll take that, please.
I am pleased to greet you on behalf of humankind.
welcome to Florida.
I have so many questions for you.
he's not an alien. He's got a hangnail.
ignore my friend. He's a doubter.
most of humanity will welcome you with open minds and open arms.
I'm from Emporia.
great! Where is that?
alpha centauri? Epsilon eridani?
there's a town in kansas called Emporia.
Yes. I'm Hector, from Kansas.
that's mine. - Well, don't give it to him.
Oh, yeah? What happened to "welcome"?
Yeah, you can have it.
under one condition.
I don't do conditions.
Oh, yeah. Nice try, pal.
so, uh, here's the condition.
Bradshaw gets his life back.
we don't make deals.
is that what you think, hmm?
listen to me here, friend.
Colonel Bradshaw is a good man.
he served his country with courage.
he followed the rules.
you will give him his life back.
because if you don't, I will keep looking.
he's turning a funny color, Walter.
you can tell Pope it all ends today in this swamp. You hear me?
Leo, put the hat back on my head.
why aren't you unconscious?
cause they couldn't zonk me without zonking old goggle eyes here, too.
could you find my glasses?
we got a deal?
you honestly expect me to believe it's these tin hats that kept him from knocking us out?
that wasn't him.
it's a high-altitude military plane up there training sonic weapons on us.
he takes off his glasses, that's the signal to zap us.
but... We're protected, pal.
I don't buy it.
what am I supposed to do, pick you guys up under each arm and pack you out of here?
we'll just have to work harder.
come up with more money.
God, Timo.
grow a set. Get the girl.
run away. Get married.
defy uncle Shad?
that's not our way.
our way has you and I married within a year.
and every time you're with the family, you'll see Magdalena with the husband that uncle Shad chooses for her.
how does that sit with you?
I had my arm around his neck. He wasn't an alien.
I know something about alloys. That was not terrestrial.
did you see the writing on it?
astronaut Bradshaw tapped for board of stellarcom insurance.
Stellarcom? Hey, that's the insurance company that we got the tinkerbell 4 info from.
Pope accepted walter's deal.
Walter even annoys aliens into doing what he wants?
it wasn't an alien.
OK, then why was goggle eyes wearing a hat?
so he could hide his ears.
or he came from a warmer planet.
he could have been hiding gills or tentacles.
again, impervious to mocking.
Walter, you made a deal for Bradshaw. That's really sweet.
not really. Getting his life back is what bradshaw really wanted me to find in the first place.
he just didn't know it.
Hey, yeah. Yeah, see that?
can I have that? That's it.
I want to bring that back to the Jeffersonian for translation and interpretation.
we were not up against aliens.
Pope works for a shadowy group of government insiders and corporate honchos.
here we go.
secrecy is the element of all goodness. Even virtue, even beauty is mysterious.
it's Joey Morolto Jr.
I didn't know the old man had a kid. - 'Cause he was 15 when his father went to prison. Junior turned 25 this week.
as a little birthday gift, they made him boss of the family.
I'm sure he has more to worry about than me.
I have a plan for Mitch McDeere, and when I am ready, you will hear about it.
so will he. - I called my parents, I'd like to see them.
I never thought we would get here, Abby. - I'm going, but I'm not leaving.
Hello, Mother. - I saw the news.
I know what happened with Noble Insurance - Conspiracy, the murders, the torture.
you're running. It has taken all these years, but you finally ran home.
how is your marriage, Abby?
are you sure?
Dr. Wilson was supposed to call in that prescription last night.
okay, thanks.
Hey, there you are. Abbs, I was starting to get worried.
we're fine.
did you get my text? - Yeah, it sounds like an interesting night.
how's your dad? - He's good. He looks older.
I mean, it's been 11 years, so, you know.
it was harder than I thought.
how's Claire? - She loved him. And he definitely loved her.
they're gonna watch a movie together this morning.
and I...
I thought my mom was ready to reconnect, but I guess just because I am doesn't mean she has to be.
Yeah, I was gonna say that to you.
look, I want you to come home, Abb.
I know that you need some time, so you just...
you do what you need to do, okay?
but the important thing is...
...what happened is done.
Mitch, it'll just be something else.
another conspiracy. - I took too many chances, I know that.
I know you need some time, it's just...
I want us to be okay again.
you just sit tight, I'm working on it!
what's up, boss? - Find Sal, and get in here.
the three of us are going to DC. - Why, what's up?
I told you, when I was ready, we'd deal with Mitch McDeere.
it's time.
that's the same suit and tie you were wearing yesterday, which means you didn't go home.
so either you're starting a trial, or this office got ransacked.
door number one: New case, big client, actually.
Henry Kettle? - Henry Kettle, novelist.
that's not a big case. That's a massive case, a press case.
Nick Kinross sent it over. The facts are actually pretty interesting.
hang on, I'm a little lost. I thought we were done with Kinross and Clark.
press cases, they bring in business, Ray. - This isn't about business, this is about keeping your mind occupied while your wife and kid are in Kentucky.
Nick's been Henry's lawyer for 15 years... copyright, publishing...
this is a murder charge. - Yeah, that's why he sent it to me.
he's been working with some big-time lawyer up in New York.
but Nick didn't trust him.
Mitch, you don't need to do this right now. Not with Abby away.
come on, man. Tammy's off getting her divorce in Tennessee.
it's just you and me, let's take a break. - I need to work, Ray.
I'm not okay right now, I don't know a damn thing.
but this... this I know.
I'm gonna go home and change. There's an eye-witness who puts Henry at the crime scene.
check him out, see if there's anything you can find that helps us.
Dr. Wilson?
so you're Maxine Sutherland's daughter. - Yes.
my daughter Claire and I are just visiting from DC.
you know, I have to say, I've known Maxine for a long time, and...
she hasn't told me much about you. - Really.
well, you know how it goes.
maybe some relationships are just beyond therapy.
I'm not your mother's therapist.
I write the occasional prescription for her, for convenience, but, uh, we're colleagues.
colleagues? - At the community center? She runs the children's program.
I help out, counsel some underprivileged kids.
volunteering...
it doesn't sound like the mom I knew.
I guess you two haven't seen each other in a while. - Actually, I really didn't come here to talk about her.
as I told your receptionist,
I just need a prescription refilled and my mom thought maybe you could help.
I see. - Your receptionist said you could just call it in.
Yeah, she shouldn't have.
I'm sorry, I don't write prescriptions for patients without a session first.
I have time now, if you're free.
I guess I could.
great, I'll let the folks out front know.
Kay... It's all set.
actually, I just remembered, I have to pick up my daughter right now.
maybe we could do this another time.
sure.
today, of course, day 1 in the trial of reclusive novelist Henry Kettle - a man very rarely seen in public.
in fact, a man known more for his secretive lifestyle than for writing in recent years.
kettle is charged with brutally killing his sister, Margaret.
sadly, rumours have been swirling about Henry Kettle for some time...
some saying the eccentric genius may be legally insane.
I am not insane. - You don't know me, Henry.
but Nick Kinross sent me here because I am experienced with cases like this.
now, I am ready for trial...
but I do have to ask the court for a psychological exam.
you honestly think I'm crazy? - I don't know what to think.
you live alone, you have no friends.
you don't even drive a car...
I had a vision I died in a car crash, that doesn't make me certifiable.
you don't talk on the phone because somebody may be listening.
you told a reporter you don't eat meat because a cow asked you not to.
that was years ago, and, at the time, I was extremely high.
this isn't funny. - I know that.
look, it's true, I am a...
...highly suspicious, deeply paranoid, militant vegetarian, but I loved my sister.
I believe that, but they have evidence.
a witness heard you arguing with Margaret in her apartment.
he saw you walk out of her door with a scratch on your face, and she was found strangled just a few minutes later.
she was alive when I left. I wouldn't hurt her.
if I think that you are unstable.
I am required by law to ask for an exam.
then just do it already!
look, I know what I am, and I'm not saying I don't need a shrink.
but I am all here. Right here.
and I am innocent.
I met Henry almost 15 years ago.
I was a young literary agent, he was an English graduate student with his first novel.
you're referring to The Saddest Generation? - Yes.
since then, it's been called perhaps the finest work of fiction in the last half-century.
20 Million copies in print worldwide. - I see.
how old was Mr. Kettle when he wrote it? - Twenty-five.
Henry was an overnight sensation.
one minute he was going to class, next minute he was teaching it.
how did he handle the attention? - Henry hated the spotlight.
he shut everyone out, except for his youngest sister, Margaret, and I.
he became... I know he hates the word... a recluse.
and what about his writing? - There was no writing.
I spent years begging him to go back to work. But, nothing.
and then, it finally happened. - What happened?
several months ago, Henry told me he was working on a new novel.
naturally, I was thrilled. But he refused to show it to me.
well, did he say why? - Yes, he was writing for himself.
no readers, no public opinion. Just the work.
I understood. But I couldn't accept it.
so I reached out to Margaret.
the defendant's sister? - Yes, she took care of Henry.
I called her. I told her the world deserves to see Henry's new book.
did she help you? - Eventually, yes.
she took it when Henry was out. She brought it to me at my hotel here in town.
when Henry realized, he called me.
how did he react? - He was furious. He wanted to stay hidden.
the idea of more praise, more public attention...
it was his nightmare.
when he hung up, I realized he was leaving to find her.
and what did you do?
I took a cab from the hotel to Margaret's apartment.
but Henry had already been there, and gone.
objection. - Sustained.
Mr. Miller, just tell us what you saw. - The door was unlocked. I knocked.
when I went inside, I found her on the ground.
I could see that she was dead.
thank you. No further questions.
Henry loved his sister, didn't he?
objection. - I'll rephrase.
did you ever see Henry get violent with Margaret?
no.
in fact, quite the opposite is true, isn't it?
Henry supported Margaret financially.
he bought her a condo, he paid her mortgage... - Yes.
Margaret was a troubled woman, wasn't she? Extremely shy, easily overwhelmed...
Objection! The victim's psychiatrist history has no relevance.
she saw doctors, all because Henry...
look, what do you want me to say, that I'm surprised? I'm more than surprised.
he's crazy, but I never thought he'd kill her. - I'm not crazy!
Mr. Kettle, there will be no outbursts in my courtroom. - I am not crazy!
Henry... - No! You tell them!
Mr. Kettle! You will sit down, sir!
or I will have you removed from the courtroom!
Henry, this is my brother Ray.
he's a private investigator.
he is looking into Margaret's neighbour, the witness who puts you at the murder scene.
good to meet you. - Liked your book.
the medical examiner's next? - Yes.
I can't hear that. I don't want to be in court for that.
Henry, you need to pull it together. There cannot be any more outbursts like this morning.
the jury cannot see you as unstable.
No! - Yes!
you cannot be absent from testimony without permission.
then you get me permission!
I mean, could you sit there, if it was your wife?
someone you loved? I'm not going.
you want to run that one by me again, Counsel?
your Honour, I know that it is unusual, but he is highly emotional.
then get him a tissue.
plenty of defendants get upset when they hear details of their own crime.
are you saying he's guilty?
he is more than upset, and he did not kill his sister, so the idea of listening to all the gory details of her murder is enough to send him over the edge.
Oh, please. - Is that a legal argument, Helen?
I don't need a legal argument to call out crap when I hear it.
your Honour, the defendant has the right to confront witnesses against him, but there is no law requiring him to be present.
what about the victim's rights?
what about our rights to force her murderer to face what he did?
now that's crap. - If your client's uncomfortable, the jury should see that.
what, so they can assume that he's guilty? That's speculation.
speculation cuts both ways, Counsel.
if I keep him in, the jury will speculate on why he's upset;
if I let him go, they'll speculate on why he's not there.
you could instruct them not to draw any conclusions.
denied, I won't risk reversal on appeal.
objection. - I've made my decision, Counsel.
tell your client to strap it in and hold it down.
he's staying.
I could come back when the movie's over.
Oh, it'll only be a minute or two longer.
you and your father.
you used to love watching old movies.
so, you saw Dr. Wilson this morning. What a coincidence.
so much for doctor-patient confidentiality. - Ben would never say anything.
Pauline Evans saw you going into the office.
I'm curious how you found him.
he just wrote me a prescription. Bottle's in my medicine chest.
you wouldn't have gone in there, would you? Perhaps looking for something to take the edge off?
Oh, of course not. After all, you've said everything's fine.
we're done! And so is the popcorn.
so, everybody behaving? - What else would we be doing?
lying like a rug... Your specialty.
I heard you talking about the community center.
maybe Abby and Claire would be interested in helping with your dance tomorrow night.
dance, where? - Harold, really.
they're in town to relax, not to work. - I like to work!
my dad works all the time. - Yeah, but if Grandma doesn't want help...
it's impolite to butt in. - No, it isn't. This is the South.
you see, Claire, your grandma runs the children's program at the Danesboro Community Center.
and tomorrow night, she's having a dance for underprivileged kids.
mom... What do you think?
I think underprivileged kids need laptops, not a cotillion.
our charity does provide educational support.
but learning how to behave in social settings is also important.
come on, Mom, let's do it! It'll help you feel better.
what are you talking about? I feel fine.
lying like a rug. Must be genetic.
okay, let's help Grandma.
the cause of death, in general terms was homicidal strangulation.
and, as the medical examiner, Dr. Schneider, how did you arrive at that conclusion?
in cases like this, we look for blunt force injury to the tissues of the neck.
with Margaret, we didn't have to look far. You can see the bruising pattern.
the finger-touch pads of the right hand along the neck, and the thumb on the opposite side.
and what do those bruises tell you? - They tell me the killer applied unusual force.
a fact I confirmed during the autopsy.
the victim had extensive soft tissue damage, and multiple fractures of the hyoid bone.
is that uncommon?
Yes, in my medical opinion, this was not your standard asphyxiation.
there is evidence of rage.
whoever wanted the victim dead, made sure the job was done.
thank you, Doctor. Nothing further. - Write something. Distract yourself.
doctor, the bruising pattern you showed us is consistent with the killer's right hand, correct?
Yes.
you are aware that my client is left-handed? - That's not dis-positive.
you said the killer wanted her dead. It seems to me he would use his good hand.
that's deceptive. In many cases, the killer will use both hands...
one on top of the other. In fact, there are signs that happened here.
signs... In other words, you're guessing.
no.
the victim had scratches on her right neck.
I believe those were made by the defendant's nails.
the curved nature of the... - You believe again.
that's not exactly scientific. So tell me, Doctor.
did you find my client's skin cells on the victim's neck?
no. - No...
so...
no further questions, Your Honour, I need a recess.
Oh, it's getting late. Let's just pick this up in the morning.
tell me what just happened, Henry. Because I think I know what just happened.
I told you, I couldn't handle it. It's fine, it barely broke the skin.
I just couldn't listen to it anymore. I had to feel something else, just anything...
Hey, you were asking me to look into the eye-witness?
check that out.
this could work, Ray. It could get us reasonable doubt.
Mr. McKenzie, did you know Margaret Kettle?
Yes, she bought a condo in my building two years ago.
my wife and I live on the same floor. We were good friends.
did you see her the day she was killed? - No.
please tell us what you did see.
I came home from work, took the elevator to the fourth floor, like always.
that's when I saw the defendant.
Mr. Kettle, you're certain? - Yes, he was coming up the stairs as I left the elevator.
he was out of breath, angry... - Objection.
the witness can't know my client's state of mind.
sustained. - Please continue, sir.
I said hello, but he ignored me.
he went to Margaret's apartment and started banging on the door.
I was concerned, but I knew Henry was her brother, so...
you went home? - Yes.
after a few minutes, I heard yelling. Clearly, they were having a fight.
I went out into the hallway. Thought about knocking.
did you? - No, I didn't get the chance.
I was walking to her door when Henry... suddenly came out.
he looked... I don't know how else to describe it... enraged.
he had a scratch running down the side of his face.
it was bleeding. - What did you do?
nothing. Henry went down the stairs, I went to Margaret's door, but she didn't answer.
thank you. No further questions.
you said you and Margaret were friends.
Yes.
I'll give you one chance to tell them, Paul.
the truth is...
you and Margaret were romantically involved.
Objection! Foundation? - I am laying the foundation.
who are you looking at? Your wife...
she doesn't know, does she... - Overruled.
the witness will answer.
this is the pendant Margaret was wearing when she died.
you bought that for her, didn't you?
this is the receipt from your credit card used to buy the pendant two days before she was murdered.
do you buy all your friends diamond pendants? - I'm sorry.
and this is the note you dictated to the store clerk on the phone.
it's very short. It just says, "Soon...Love, Paul."
you told Margaret you were going to leave your wife, but you didn't leave, did you?
you wanted to buy more time so you gave Margaret a gift.
Objection! - Overruled.
what happened? Did she threaten you?
did she threaten to walk down the hall and tell your wife the truth?
no... - So you killed her.
I didn't kill her!
if she was so angry at me, why was she wearing that pendant?
look... I loved her.
I wrote "Soon" in that card because I meant it.
I wanted us to be together.
grandma, look at how pretty this looks!
Oh, lovely, dear.
Regina, help her with the clumping.
still no sound?
no, the vendor thinks that it's a blown fuse in the amplifier.
and He'll replace it, but you're gonna have to take it down to his shop.
I'm gonna get you some help.
Oh, Ben! - Maxine!
everything looks so great.
and, uh...
I see you've recruited some excellent help.
how was the session? - Mother!
Oh, cool your cannons, Abby, I wasn't talking about you.
the center has given us office space upstairs and Ben donates his time twice a week to counsel the new kids.
it went fine, I think we can help them. - Wonderful.
Oh, perhaps you can help us too.
Abby needs to take this amplifier across town and she could use a man with good biceps.
anything for you, Maxine. - No. Mother, we shouldn't inconvenience Dr. Wilson.
I'm sure he's very busy.
actually, I'm not. - No, really, my mother's afraid of anything that might break a nail.
Abby, this kind gentleman has offered his assistance.
be polite. - Besides, Dr. Wilson said he's helping me.
and I accept.
ms. Figgus...
at the risk of being optimistic, does the state rest? - No, Your Honour.
the people call Robert Frane to the stand.
your Honour, Mr. Frane is not on the witness list.
because the people didn't know Mr. Frane was a witness. He found us this morning.
don't worry, Counsel, you'll have time before cross, if you need it.
robert Frane, I'm senior vice-president of Crossfield Press.
we publish fiction novels based here in DC.
and sir, can you tell me, is this one of the novels submitted to your company?
Yes, I received a call from Margaret Kettle shortly before she died.
she told me she was sending her brother's book. It arrived in the mail the next day.
objection, sidebar, Your Honour?
I don't see how this document is relevant.
this document is the defendant's new novel. - So?
so, your client had a reason for not wanting it published. And it wasn't his fear of praise.
objection overruled.
Mr. Frane, did you read the book?
Yes. - You had no right to do that!
I wrote that for myself!
Mr. McDeere, if your client can't control himself...
those pages are private! - Mr. Kettle, sit down!
or an officer will sit you down, understood?
please, give us your professional opinion.
as a publisher, I was astonished.
I found the writing to be mediocre, at best.
it was structurally flawed, amateurish.
the characters were poorly drawn, and each page, to put it mildly, was a grammatical catastrophe.
move to strike. This testimony is directly relevant.
to what? This trial is about a murder! It's not a book review!
to rage. Mr. Kettle wasn't angry because his writing was exposed.
he was angry because he was exposed as a washed-up talent.
I want this testimony stricken, along with the commentary.
all those years, being told you're a genius.
to know, in your own mind, that you'd lost your gift.
and to have that fact brought out by your own sister.
Objection! - Sustained.
approach the bench. - I was just responding to an objection.
you were crossing the line, and you damn-well know it.
that being said, the relevance objection is again denied.
your Honour! - It goes to motive, Counsel.
if your client felt humiliated by the victim
she can't prove that! Maybe Henry thought the book was brilliant.
maybe, but she can argue the point. I'll let the jury decide.
Ah, all right, there we go! No problem.
nothing that a chiropractor and a scotch couldn't fix.
is this your way of asking me out for a drink?
actually, I don't think my husband would love that.
your husband. Wait, I'm sorry,
I was under the impression you were in town because your marriage didn't work out.
an impression you got from my mother.
more like wishful thinking on her part.
she disapproved of your husband. - Oh, You're the shrink...
is boycotting your only daughter's wedding a sign of disapproval?
you know, I did notice you never rescheduled our appointment. - Yeah, well...
with you and my mom working together, it didn't seem like a great idea.
and now that you've hit on me, it's... - I got bad information. You can't hold that against me.
okay.
if you don't hold this against me...
I took this off your desk when you were out of the room.
I didn't try to fill it.
I'm glad.
what changed your mind? - My daughter.
I-I... I thought I had it under control, but...
even she noticed that something's wrong and I can't do that to her again.
do what again?
there's a reason that I haven't seen my parents for a while.
my husband and I were put into witness protection ten years ago.
and you weren't allowed to see them?
it's been hard.
and so I use the pills as a way to make things easier.
but it's been a problem.
and once it got really bad.
pills are an escape.
a way to avoid reality.
what reality are you trying to avoid now?
your mom seems to think it's your marriage.
I feel like I should be paying you.
I didn't mean for this to turn into a session.
no, it's fine. - No, I'm sorry. I just...
I have been talking to the same 3 people for like, 10 years.
so it's really nice to... - Talk to someone new, I get it.
Yeah. You don't need to come with me.
really, I mean, the store's just right around the corner, and I think they're gonna fix it pretty quick.
I have the time.
and, anyway...
the store's that way.
you have no idea where you are.
okay.
look, I'm not against looking.
I've been looking. I make looking look good.
but what the hell am I looking for? - Something, I don't know.
but if Henry is innocent, then there must be something that we missed.
Ooh, vouchered item.
one glass recovered from the table next to the victim.
contents found to be water.
prints belonged to the victim only.
vouchered item... Ladies handbag.
contents include... One lady's wallet, assorted credit cards, one keyring, three housekeys.
vouchered item... Cough drops, two, recovered from...
okay, this is stupid. - Wait, why the third key on the ring?
it's a standard door, it's just got a top and a bottom lock.
I don't know, maybe it's an extra.
actually...
there's an auto payment on her credit card monthly to a place called the Vault.
that sound like storage? - The Vault, 118 Omega Street.
Yeah, it could be. Check it out. - Alright.
writers only.
what is this place?
I was wondering if somebody would show up.
I thought maybe I'd have to gather her things by myself.
well, the name kind of threw me off. - Yeah, it's understandable.
"the Vault," it's supposed to be like the place you go to lock yourself away to get some writing done.
but it's open to the public. - Assuming we have the space available.
we have ten rooms. We offer coffee and writing supplies.
the brilliant ideas are your responsibility.
did you know Margaret Kettle? - Not really.
but as well as anyone else around here. Margaret liked to be off on her own.
this is it.
I told the police about this place, but they didn't seem to care.
said to send any personal effects back to the family. - Henry's the writer in the family.
so why would Margaret rent a space in the Vault? - Don't know.
I'll be down front if you need me. - All right, thanks.
Margaret was writing a book.
a book that told the truth about her and Henry.
Henry, I am your lawyer.
I'm here to help you. We're here to help you.
we know about Margaret, we know how this started.
the Saddest Generation, it's a brilliant novel.
but you didn't write it. Margaret did.
how could you know that?
we found Margaret's new book.
Margaret was writing again, non-fiction.
the true story of how The Saddest Generation was written.
I didn't know. - It's like a diary.
she tells all of it.
about how she wrote the novel when she was 19, about how she begged you to take credit for it.
I didn't want to.
I tried to stop it, but they wouldn't listen.
who wouldn't listen? - Margaret.
and my father. I don't understand!
it's a novel, I never thought they would like it.
she submitted it under your name, Henry.
and they do like it! - Then tell them the truth!
I can't.
she can barely leave the house, Henry. Margaret can't talk to people the way that you can!
I don't care! I have my own writing!
there's an agent, he wants a meeting.
one meeting. After that, they can publish the book.
Henry, we need the money! - Henry, please! I can't meet them.
look at me, I can't be around too many people. I...
people love you, Henry.
once it's published, you can go back to your own writing.
we need the money!
one meeting, that's what they said.
but when the book came out, it was over.
when the critics said it was brilliant, there were reporters and interviewers.
why wouldn't Margaret do it? - She couldn't do that.
even as a kid, Margaret had doctors and phobias and...
I was the normal one, the happy one. Look at me now.
Henry, your story isn't over yet.
when she found out I was writing again, she was so angry.
Why? - I betrayed her.
you know, you have to understand, in her mind, Margaret was Henry Kettle.
you know, only she could write a book using that name.
your name.
you know, I told her, I didn't care about publishing. I just wanted to write again.
you know, for myself, just so I could see what I could have been on my own.
she didn't believe me.
it wasn't her fault though. Margaret...
wasn't well.
you know, she couldn't control her emotions.
and that's why she stole your pages?
to embarrass me.
when she took the pages, I went to find her, and...
she wouldn't listen.
she slapped me.
do you have any idea what it's like to wake up every day knowing you're living someone else's life?
Henry, did you kill Margaret? - No.
but it's too late. I mean, the jury thinks I did, they're convinced I'm crazy.
no, it is not too late. We never give up.
excuse me, miss.
ask her.
my name's Zack.
may I have this dance?
sure.
see, some things are better than a laptop.
what, none of the boys ask you to dance?
well, aren't you just in the most unexpected places?
nice to see you too.
so you come to all these teenage dances? - I'm working.
well, I was working.
I just came out to take a break and get some air.
working nights, dedicated and charming.
it's just I'm trying to track down some missing money.
see, we get state funds to treat these kids, and...
I just can't seem to account for it all. - Well, maybe I could help you.
I do all the bookkeeping at our office at home.
I might take you up on that.
how's it going with your mom?
Oh, about the same.
look, I just gotta say it couldn't have been easy for her......watching her only daughter go into witness protection.
if you take her side,
I am gonna throw you off this balcony.
I used to go to dances. In white gloves.
and my mom taught me the keys to being a woman, like fine manners and good posture.
uh, and it was all so small.
and that's why Mitch was magical.
you know, my mom just wanted to change her wardrobe every season.
so did you. - Yeah.
and how's that working out?
guess I got what I wanted.
but sometimes I wish my life was smaller.
simpler.
you know what I mean?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.
no, you shouldn't have.
we've all done things we wish we could take back.
I hear ya.
but taking credit for a book that's a national treasure? Come on.
okay, new theory. Go back to the night Margaret died.
Henry goes over to Margaret's apartment. He's angry, he confronts her about stealing the pages.
they argue, and he leaves.
Margaret's still alive.
okay, that works, assuming someone came in and strangled her after he left.
you have a suspect? - Yeah, maybe. One.
who?
the dude that found the body? - Or maybe he didn't.
maybe she was alive when he got there. - Come on, we ruled him out because there was no motive.
until now.
when he gets there, Margaret's upset.
he tries to calm her down, but she doesn't. She tells him the truth.
that she wrote the Saddest Generation.
why would she do that? - Because she can't control her emotions.
she threatens to go public with it.
but why does he kill her? - Money!
Miller's got Henry's new book. He knows it's worth a fortune.
he sells it and gets a huge commission.
unless Margaret tells the truth.
Henry Kettle is a fraud. Okay, that's a theory.
Miller's a big guy, he could easily strangle a woman Margaret's size.
Plus, he's probably right-handed. - Right-handed, well that narrows it down.
I don't see how you're gonna prove this.
I think I might know a way.
we need to talk.
I'm not taking a plea. - Neither am I.
Henry didn't kill Margaret, but I might know who did.
you might? - It's your choice, Helen.
hear me out now, or we play this out in front of a jury.
and If I'm right, you set an innocent man free;
if I'm wrong, then you lose nothing, and we go on with the trial.
I'm listening. - I need a continuance. And...
I need you to make a call.
Mr. Miller.
would you come with us please, sir? - What's this about?
this is absurd. Now you think I killed Margaret.
honestly, no.
then what the hell are we doing here? - Just tying up loose ends.
I'm assuming you have nothing to hide. - I don't.
so then let's just do this so we can all move forward.
your wedding ring, may I see it please?
Why? - Please.
what the hell is this? What are you doing?
Margaret had scratches on her neck, curved scratches.
the M. E. thought that they were from Henry's fingernails.
I don't think so.
the ring's been cleaned. Nothing on the surface.
remove the stone.
no, hang on. - Sit down, Mr. Miller.
you'll be out of here soon enough.
we have blood.
why is there blood on your ring, Gordon?
answer the question. - He doesn't have to.
the swab will come back a match to Margaret Kettle's DNA and we'll know why.
I babysat that crazy son of a bitch for 15 years.
begging him all that time to favour us with his genius.
write us another masterpiece. - He didn't even write the first one.
what does that mean?
it means Henry's a fraud.
his sister wrote The Saddest Generation.
you should have seen her.
shy little Margaret. Mocking me.
she was gonna make sure everyone knew the truth.
do you know how much a new manuscript from Henry Kettle is worth?
nothing. You didn't have to kill her. The book isn't any good.
good. It doesn't matter.
it's Henry Kettle.
I would have sold it for millions.
the trial is over, Henry.
the D. A.' s dismissing all charges. You're free.
thank you.
not just from me, from Margaret.
one thing... My sister's book, the one you found.
it's our story, a memoir?
it's her follow-up to the Great American Novel.
the one everyone's been waiting for me to write.
I want to publish it.
if you do, everyone'll know the truth.
it's time.
I just want to be myself again.
hi Dad, it's me.
we're at the hotel. Call us back. And go home if you're still at the office.
I love you.
Hi, it's Abby, please leave a message.
ray, did you forget something?
sorry guys, we're closed.
you.
I've been thinking about this moment since I was 15 years old.
you know who I am?
Mr. Morolto asked you a question.
you're Joey. - You know why I'm here?
go on, you son of a bitch, get it over with.
Mitch, Mitch. Come on now.
it's 2012. I don't want to kill you.
I want to hire you.
Hello, mother. - Why did you come back?
after all these years, why now? - So, you're Maxine's daughter...
I've been talking to the same three people for, like, 10 years.
so it's really nice to- - Talk to someone new, I get it.
but sometimes I wish my life was simpler.
I want you to come home, Ab. I want us to be okay again.
what happened is done.
it will be just something else; another conspiracy.
boss, your old man died in prison because of this guy.
I told you, when I was ready, we'd deal with Mitch McDeere.
it's time. - I'm sorry guys, we're closed.
Mitch McDeere, I've thinking about this moment since I was 15 years old.
you know why I'm here? - Go on, you son of a bitch.
get it over with. - I don't wanna kill you.
I wanna hire you.
when I was 15 years old I made a promise to find you.
and I'm a man who takes his promises very seriously.
I know Abby and Claire are in Kentucky.
I know Tammy is working on her divorce in Tennessee.
what do you want?
I told you. I want to hire you.
a friend of mine has been charged with murder here in D. C.
his name is Patrick Walker. I want you to represent him.
you're not serious.
you let me know what it is about my tone that suggests I'm not serious.
he's a good friend.
he's been framed for a crime he didn't commit, and I want him out.
I don't handle racket cases. Organized crime is specialized.
you need a lawyer - - I know what I need!
he's not part of my family. He's an economist.
went to school at MIT.
works for a big think-tank here in town;
spends his days thinking about job creation and trade deficits.
who did he kill? - Nobody.
a woman, allegedly; not that she's nobody, but like I said, he was framed.
Joey, I'm just a guy. I never even knew your father.
I'd joined a firm in Memphis and everything went wrong.
I never testified - - You helped the Feds!
you took down the law firm, which took down my father.
you cannot blame me for...
I'm sorry, I didn't realize we were having a debate.
whose turn is it, yours or mine?
here's my offer. You are gonna handle the case.
that's what you're gonna do for me.
if you do, the McDeere and Morolto families will be square.
that's what I'm gonna do for you.
why me? - Because this is what you do best:
uncover the truth.
in Memphis... now with Nobel Insurance, you see what other lawyers don't.
and, uh...
most lawyers just want to win.
you need to win.
a good boss knows how to incentivise his employees.
and if I say no? - You've two choices, Mitch.
you can do this for me, or you can wait until we leave, call Louis Coleman and you can run.
maybe I won't find you. But I promise you this...
I won't stop looking.
I'll be back in the morning.
if you're here, I'll know I have a lawyer.
if you're not, I'll know I don't.
I can't believe he just walked into the office. - They have been watching us for months.
so why not do something sooner? Why now? - The case.
he's keeping us alive so we can get his friend released.
and What stops him from killing us after? - Nothing. His promise.
we can run. Not with the Feds, on our own.
we've always had a backup plan. - Which would work if we were all together.
we need to make a decision right now.
do we call Louis? - Or what, work for the Mob?
are you really considering this? - Yeah, of course I'm considering this, Ray.
it's because the alternative is to call my wife, who has just been through a living hell, and tell her that we are running again.
so instead, you're gonna tell her you're working for Joey Morolto?
look, if we can get Morolto out of our lives then maybe she will come back and we will be okay.
but even if you do this, we are nowhere near okay.
let's just talk to the client; one meeting.
Morolto said that he is not Mob; that he is an economist. - I don't like it.
if something goes wrong we get the hell out of here.
okay, fine. Do it.
call Louis.
one meeting.
unfortunately, I do still have to charge you for our sessions.
Really?
I know you were hoping for that awkward interlude on the balcony with your therapist discount, but...
well, it only seems fair.
is that what you are now, my therapist?
you know, I might take it personally if you hire someone else.
I'm just saying,
I-I don't know how the board of ethics would feel about you kissing a patient.
I mean, that was you wasn't it? You know, it was pretty dark out there.
no, no, that was me. - So...?
so... So I think you need to schedule an appointment right away.
how's tomorrow at two?
two's good.
Hey, um that's my other line.
I gotta go. - Yeah, yeah, go.
see you then.
Hey! - Hey.
glad I caught you. - Yeah, you caught me.
hey so, my dad's taking Claire to work with him at the bank today.
and my mom invited me to lunch.
so, how's it going?
it's... It's not so good, - but we'll see how it goes today. - I miss you.
I know I'm supposed to be giving you space, but I just wanted to...
I just wanted to call and say it. - I miss you too.
look, a client just walked in the office. Can I call you back?
Yeah. - Tammy, I gotta run.
I'll call you back. - May I?
you know, I never liked these but I've heard Reagan ate 'em.
he did all right for himself, huh?
you're here - Guess that means you're in. - Not exactly.
we want a meeting with the client. - I can save you the trip.
he's innocent.
how do you know that? - He told me.
you'll find most people don't lie to me. - You know what I think?
I think if you wanted to kill us you would have done it by now, but you didn't.
you waited, you know why? Because this case
this guy, he matters to you.
you don't want us to take this case, you need us to take this case.
I need a meeting.
Antonio? - Yeah, boss?
get the car. -Get the car.
this is him?
Mitch McDeere, Patrick Walker.
something wrong? - I'm thinking.
are you thinking if something's wrong?
I'm thinking three button suit, which means you will follow trends.
I'm thinking do I want a lawyer who follows trends?
Patrick... - I'm thinking charcoal grey feels safe and predictable.
do I want a lawyer who's safe and predictable? - Hey! Dial it back.
here's what I'm thinking - one and two button suits are worn by prosecutors.
double-breasted, by Mob lawyers, which I invite you to hire.
fair enough.
I'm thinking trials are about persuasion, which means about juries.
juries want comfort, not excitement.
they want to trust the guy who's asking them to put an alleged killer back out on the street.
I'm thinking, do I want a client who is sure that he is the smartest guy in the room when I have been here for 30 seconds and I know that he is clearly not?
I like him. - Told you.
sorry. You know the charge?
I know it's a murder charge. I don't know anything about the victim.
Yeah, well neither do I. Her name is Charlotte Miller and that's all they told me.
you must know something. - I know where I went out for drinks after work.
roma, one of my family clubs here in town. - It's a restaurant/bar, very upscale.
you never saw the victim? - I don't even know who she is.
I went home, took off my suit and went out again.
there was a poker game at a place called The Palace.
I was in my car and all of a sudden there were these lights behind me, pulling me over.
were you drunk? - I didn't think so. I was fine.
but this cop wants to give me a breathalyser.
I blew a . 08. - That's legally impaired.
barely. - They arrested me and then impounded the car.
and I guess they found a...suitcase in the trunk.
cops said she was stuffed inside. Undressed and strangled.
the victim's body was found in the trunk of your car?
he didn't kill her - like I said, he was framed.
I know how this looks, but I'm telling you.
man to man.
I have never met Charlotte Miller.
time's up, Mitch.
are you in or out?
you took the case? - I said we're in.
"we're out" really didn't seem workable in the moment.
so, you think this Patrick was framed? - Unlikely.
a killer puts a strange woman in an innocent economist's trunk?
I said "unlikely."
but you gotta admit, it is possible.
a body in a suitcase is easily portable.
they'd slip it in his trunk when he's at the bar, or when he's back at his apartment.
so, we're doing this? We're trying to figure this out?
the first sign of trouble, we back out and we run.
we're already at the 15th sign of trouble. - You can't have it both ways, Ray.
you can't do this and give me crap for doing it.
okay, what do you want me to do?
Patrick said that he was on his way to a poker game when he got pulled over.
verify if the poker game was happening that night. - And what are you doing?
I'm gonna go to the U. S. Attorney's office, see if the Prosecutor has a theory.
and if so, we need to know what it is.
you drew this case?
don't worry, this one doesn't involve national security.
I'll tell you what I know, but you won't want to hear it. - My client didn't even know the victim.
you believe him?
well, it's my job to believe him until you prove otherwise.
your job? Since when do you rep Walker?
I thought I was dealing with Barry Vance on this one. - Vance is out; I'm in.
fine by me. Vance is a mob lawyer mouthpiece.
Really? - Your boy's connected.
word is Walker is tight with Joey Morolto of Chicago.
Nah, they're old friends. He's not even Mob. Not even Italian.
look, I gotta turn this footage over to you anyways, so you might as well see it while you're here.
that's Walker's building; freight elevator at the end of the third floor hall.
you'll note it's 2: 04, about 12 minutes before your boy gets pulled over.
that's the suitcase with Charlotte Miller inside.
there's a camera in the lobby elevator. That's why he's using the freight.
but he didn't know they put one in here a few months ago.
how do you know the suitcase isn't empty?
wheels get caught; he uses both hands to pull the bag on.
you know why? It weighs 117 pounds.
circumstantial. - Like hell.
Charlotte Miller is in that bag. We also found her clothes.
her clothes were in his building?
they were bundled up with your client's sheets and thrown down the trash chute.
not smart.
he must have been moving pretty quickly, which is why I don't think he meant to kill her.
manslaughter? - Rough sex gone wrong...
they met at Roma, went back to his place; things got a little hot and heavy...
you want my theory, there you have it.
I thought we were having lunch. - We are.
now, before you look at these, I want a quick opinion, not a big to-do.
your father mentioned that you balanced the books for your little firm at home.
patronizing, condescending and vaguely sexist, but I am going to choose not to see it that way.
I'm gonna choose to see it as you asking me for help.
you know I'm not very good with money.
well, you were always better at spending it than you were with accounting for it.
rude, obnoxious, vaguely sexist...
okay, what's the problem? - The budget for the community centre.
we get significant funding from the state every year, but if you look at what we spend on the children it doesn't add up.
Dr. Wilson mentioned that.
Really? During one of your sessions?
is that you have an accountant? - Yes we do.
his name is Charles Finley.
he took over for Martin Gorham when he passed last year.
nice man... - But?
but Martin had a ledger. He kept everything by hand.
since Charles has come on board, we can't seem to find it.
that's convenient. - And suspicious, I agree.
we can't compare the new numbers with the old ones without that ledger.
Charles says he simply misplaced it, but it does make me wonder.
nice place. - Yeah, what brings you in?
um, Mitch is gonna come down and have a talk with Joey.
maybe not the best time; things are pretty tense.
can I get you something, sir? - Nah, I'm good thanks.
they tell me you were inside, Brushy Mountain. Yeah, I did a 15 year bid.
did a nickel myself at Joliet.
so this... Patrick... why is the boss so invested?
what, You guys gonna get him out? - I don't know.
he already lied about the poker game, so that's not a good way to start.
Yeah, you guys need to do somethin'. Boss likes Patrick.
he trusts him. - Yeah, why?
the kid's crazy smart. Helps Joey with all the business stuff.
right now, he's the guy Joey trusts the most.
Patrick lied. I just talked to the Prosecutor.
everything Patrick told us was a lie.
you wanna sit?
her clothes were in his building.
they found them wrapped up in his sheets and thrown down the incinerator chute.
damn... - You knew?
Patrick told me the clothes were gone. Burned.
they have him on video getting on the elevator 12 minutes before the cops picked him up.
with the suitcase. - No, there weren't any cameras.
they were installed two months ago.
now look, I don't know what your angle is, Joey, but I will give you my professional opinion.
Patrick is going to prison. - That doesn't work for me.
the Prosecutor thinks it's manslaughter.
I say we run with that offer and plead it out.
okay, he lied. We lied.
but the case is the same; he was framed. - You don't believe that...
when he got back to his apartment the girl was there.
he found her in his bed. What was he supposed to do?
she was dead. Strangled, half naked...
it was a set-up. - Why didn't he call you? Ask for help?
I don't know. He was drinking.
if he had, we wouldn't be here right now. - I'm out. I want out of this.
you're not out; you got a wife and kid, remember?
to hell with this, we're getting played. - Yeah, I'm starting to get that impression.
this Patrick guy is a real piece of work; stone-cold liar.
he's a lot more than that, brother. I think he's Joey's closest advisor.
meaning what? - Meaning our new client is not just an economist.
he's Joey's new consigliere.
we spent all that time and money protecting you and your family from the Chicago Mob
I was gonna tell you. - I got shot helping Abby with the Noble case.
I broke you and Ray out of jail.
I risked my career and Joey Morolto waltzes through your front door and I have to read about it in a surveillance report?
are you still watching me? - No, not you, him.
the FBI tracked him from Chicago to D. C.
but they didn't know to warn you because you left the program.
hey look, it's not like I asked to see him. He found me.
and offered you a job.
and your brains are so scrambled after Noble Insurance you said yes.
how did you know that? - I'm a Federal Agent, Mitch.
you signed the visiting log at a prison. And yes, let me tell you something.
we know about Patrick Walker. - Then you know that I didn't have a choice.
Joey made me an offer: I either take the case and we're square, or run.
and you believe him?
you think you do this one thing for him. he's just gonna forget that you put his father in prison?
I was trying to protect my family. - I should just let you do this.
I should just walk away.
didn't all this start because you didn't want to be a Mob lawyer?
Louis, what do you want me to say? - Let's go.
where? - The FBI.
you wanna work for Joey Morolto, you need to see what you're getting into.
this is your client. He's one of Joey Morolto's top lieutenants.
Mitch, it's the wrong time to get involved with the Moroltos.
there's a major rift in the family.
over what? - Over the future.
Joey is the next generation of the mob.
he understands that the Golden Age is over.
he wants to move the family connections to move into legitimate businesses.
and so, what's the problem? - You're looking at 'em here.
these guys, they don't care about legitimate businesses.
they run vice operations, loan sharking, gambling, hijacking;
they're not too happy about being pushed aside.
they don't like the boss listening to Patrick Walker.
exactly, Joey's already got a consigliere, Antonio Cervino.
how do you think he feels about the new kid in town?
your client.
madge, it's Charley Findley. I found those invoices you wanted.
okay, Charles, I'm betting you still have that ledger.
a rift? - It makes sense; Joey's headed in a new direction.
this guy, what's his name? - Antonio... something.
Antonio. He's upset about being replaced, so he figures out a way to eliminate the competition.
so you think Antonio framed Patrick, but a couple of hours ago you were convinced that Patrick was guilty.
it's possible. It is possible, right?
Oh, yeah right. - I don't care about the truth.
we argue it, it gets us reasonable doubt; gets us off the hook with Joey.
what? - Nothing, just... you are not caring about the truth.
we've come a long way.
look, if we're gonna do this you need to talk to Joey.
Antonio's still his top lieutenant. Gonna have to clear it with him first.
what are you doing? - I'm Maxine Sutherland's daughter.
this is a private office. That's my private property.
this is not your... - You had no right to come in here.
I'm taking this. - You will do no such thing.
Ben, Dr. Wilson!
Abby, what's going on? Are you all right? - Ben, the ledger...
Charles has it; it's in his desk. - What ledger?
the one that he claims is missing. - This woman broke into my office.
it's right there under his desktop. - Abby...
it's right there. He's stealing. Money's missing, you said so yourself.
Charles, I'm sorry. - What?
this woman's a patient and I've been counselling her.
she had no right breaking into your office. - You'd better get her out of here.
now.
what was that? I was about to ask you the same thing.
you did nothing. All you had to do was open his desk.
exactly, Abby, his desk. You can't just break into somebody's office.
okay, let's get one things straight.
you and I have had some conversations but you are not counselling me, and I am not your patient.
you know, after that maybe you should be.
my father was 43 when they made him boss.
me? I'm a legacy.
I inherited this family.
that's why people underestimate me.
some even question my view of the future.
listen Morolto, we don't underestimate you and we mean you no disrespect.
but it is pretty clear that you are listening to the advice of Patrick Walker rather than your consigliere.
no. - You trust Patrick, it makes sense that Antonio would feel threatened.
I said no.
my consigliere has been with this family for 40 years.
he's served my father with love. It doesn't have to be the truth.
we can take that argument to the jury. It can get us reasonable doubt.
you're asking for permission to accuse my top lieutenant of framing Patrick?
Yes.
I can't do that.
find another way to win.
you and I need to talk.
if it were up to me, you'd be dead.
killed you myself months ago when we found you.
Joey Sr. was more than my boss.
I would have taken a bullet for him.
the fact that you're breathing, and he's not...
it offends me.
I assume you know this.
I was overruled by his son, so that was that.
loyalty, respect, discipline
what goes on between me and my boss is between me and my boss.
so, the next time you question my loyalty...
you remember something.
my loyalty's the only reason you're alive.
Hello?
sorry to interrupt. I thought I might find you here.
um, no problem, we were just finishing up.
this is the Assistant U. S. Attorney, Allan Harper.
this is Antonio - I'm sorry, I-I don't...
know your full name.
nice company you're keeping.
hm, what have you got there?
well, speaking of people who'd prefer to remain anonymous, we've got some new discovery on the Walker case.
it turns out what we gave you wasn't complete.
apparently your client's car wasn't stopped solely because of his erratic driving.
which he denies.
the officer was responding to an anonymous tip relayed through the 911 operator.
a tip?
reporting that your client was drunk and where his car would be.
my client says he was framed. Now, hang on.
the tip supports his defence. The caller could have been a set-up.
that call could have come from anyone.
passing motorists who saw him weaving. - Which I am moving to suppress.
then you'll lose. The search was good, Mitch.
no judge is gonna toss a body in that trunk.
right, so that's why you came here, to see my reaction?
because you're not nervous...
Hey. Thank you for coming.
you walked away pretty angry today. Could you blame me?
I'm sorry. I was caught a little off guard.
you sold me out, Ben. You sold out the kids who need treatment.
why, because I wouldn't break into a colleague's desk?
because he's stealing, Ben, and we had the evidence.
but instead of holding him accountable, you apologized to him for my behaviour.
well, if you knew he was stealing, you should have called the police.
I didn't know. That's why I was investigating.
investigating? Do you hear yourself, Abby?
look, I'm sorry I disappointed you.
but pretty much any guy you would have called at that moment would have done the same thing.
I can think of one who wouldn't. Yeah...
why did you kiss me? Because I wanted to.
why did you kiss me back? I don't have a good answer for that.
try.
the day you met me you knew I was running, and I am.
and the pills...
and you are a reaction to being scared.
and you know what?
as tired as I am, I think I am mostly tired of being scared.
spoke to the brothers McDeere today.
word is we've got an internal problem. What kind of a problem?
a rift.
their word, not mine. A divide, a split
I know what a rift is. - Good.
you know I plan to take this family legit.
you know that's our future. Mr. Morolto
you know Patrick?
he's part of that plan.
he's helping me shape that plan, and I understand why that might upset you.
senior Morolto, I don't know what I've done to deserve your disrespect.
but after 40 years, do I really have to declare my loyalty?
no.
I assume your loyalty.
as my consigliere, you're here because I want your advice.
is there a rift, a divide, a split, a problem
I need to know about?
no.
got it; 12 second call from 911.
did you listen to it? - No.
Yeah, I'm calling about a drunk driver heading south from Virginia Avenue, near Victoria Boulevard.
he's in an '09 black BMW 5 Series, about 30. Dark hair, dark jacket...
you better get out there before he kills somebody. That's why the cops stopped Patrick.
what do you think that's someone calling from the road? No way; too quiet, too specific.
not enough road noise - I don't think that was from a moving vehicle.
no, I agree.
if Patrick Walker was framed that is probably the voice of the man who did it.
I didn't know they'd put a camera on the freight elevator.
Yeah, we kind of figure that.
or about the victim's clothes, which were found wrapped in your sheets?
I panicked. I told you the truth, okay?
I don't know Charlotte Miller and I didn't kill her. I don't believe him.
I found her in my bedroom.
I mean, yeah I left that part out, but it doesn't change anything.
whether somebody put her in my bed, or my car, I was still framed.
I don't know what to believe. But we did find something.
you weren't pulled over for erratic driving. The cop who stopped you got an anonymous tip.
what kind of a tip? A 911 call saying exactly where you were.
I told you, see, that shows that I was framed.
well, it's a start. I wasn't drunk.
legally, maybe, but I was driving fine. Somebody wanted that cop to stop me.
who knew you were drinking? Nobody. I don't know.
maybe the guys at Joey's club, but they're not the kind to call the police.
Yeah, well maybe your friends in the Morolto family aren't feeling so friendly these days.
what does that mean? It means maybe you got too close to the boss.
you know, pissing off gangsters can be bad for your health.
you think this was an inside job? One of Joey's guys?
you ask that like it hasn't occurred to you.
which I find interesting considering your intelligence.
look, there are rules about when cops can use anonymous tips.
they can't just search because someone called them.
the tip has to be sufficiently reliable. And you don't think it was?
maybe not. I filed motion to suppress. So, what happens if we win?
then the search is out, the police had no right to stop you, and then anything found in the trunk is inadmissible.
even a body? Yes.
the prosecutor wouldn't be allowed to connect the body to the car.
the only thing left would be the victim's clothes.
and that's no enough to charge murder. No, probably not.
so, we could be one hearing away from freedom? Both of us.
you said Claire liked books?
I'll have it shipped to your house. She's gonna love it, dad.
Hey, I've been doing a lot of thinking and
and it's time for you two to go. We'll see you soon.
I had a feeling.
your mother told me about the Dr. Wilson situation.
what situation? You finding the ledger.
you know, some things never change.
you never could bear the idea of anyone getting away with anything.
I never could, could I?
you-you broke into the man's office, Abby. I had to know.
I know that it sounds crazy, dad - but, I...
no it doesn't; it doesn't sound crazy.
you always were brave, fearless.
you had to know the truth. It sounds like you.
it sounds like Mitch.
I've been blaming him
resenting him for where we are, but it's-it's not just him.
that instinct, that needing to know - that's in me too.
I missed you.
I wish mom and I had connected. She wants to.
don't give up on her. Try one more time before you go.
I pulled behind the vehicle driven by a white male.
an '09 black BMW 5 Series - saw what I observed to be erratic driving.
objection. Sustained; you'll need to be more specific, officer.
varying speeds, a slight weave within the lanes, so I hit the lights and made him stop.
and what exactly did you observe? The defendant; He matched the description.
he had a breath mint in his mouth, but it didn't mask the smell of alcohol.
I removed him from his car and asked him to take a breathalyser exam.
and did he? Yes.
let the record reflect the results of that breathalyser, . 08.
the defendant was legally impaired, so I arrested him and impounded his vehicle.
the body was found later on that night during a routine inventory search of the trunk at the yard.
no further questions.
you don't know who called in that tip, do you? No, sir.
you never even heard it. That's correct.
so, you couldn't say whether or not the caller was credible.
you couldn't even form an opinion as to whether or not they were telling the truth.
he was right about everything.
but you didn't know that when you stopped my client.
he gave us the correct make and model of the car, the location, the description of the driver...
so, that's all it takes?
if I describe somebody accurately enough that warrants a search?
he was driving erratically. He varied his speeds.
he slowed down because there was a police car behind him.
the car was weaving. So you say, but it was within the lane.
it wasn't even outside of the line.
was he speeding? He was drunk.
look, the call said to stop him before he killed someone.
that implies that he was seen driving erratically.
I see, so you based your decision on what the caller implied
Objection! Overruled.
you don't even know that he was drunk, do you?
what matters is what you knew when you made the stop.
already? I-I think it's time.
I needed space to get perspective, and I have that now.
I know what I want. Mitch.
Yes. Because you love the witness protection program.
it was your life's dream come true. I'm not gonna argue with you, mom.
and now that you've been out for under a year, look what's happened.
I'm glad you got to meet Claire.
I hope you can see now, Abby; now you have Claire.
I hope you realize how hard it would be to see your child make choices that you think will hurt her.
she's my daughter, mom.
there's nothing she could do that would make me push her out of my life.
I thought...
I hoped that we could find space in our lives for each other, but maybe that just can't happen now.
nice job. We'll see.
no judge wants to grant suppression in a murder case.
if we lose? Well, then we'll argue that he was framed.
you know our prime suspect? He came to see me in my office last night.
wasn't too happy about me doubting his loyalty.
Really? He came to see you without my permission?
don't worry, Counsellor. It's under control.
you do your job, I'll do mine.
a young woman has been murdered and her family deserves justice.
it's easy to focus only on that, but my job is to also care about justice for the accused.
in some states the law simply doesn't require that anonymous tips on drunk drivers be corroborated.
the tip itself is enough to justify an officer's search.
in other states the tip must be precise and predict certain facts that the officer can corroborate on the scene.
when a split like this occurs we expect the Supreme Court to decide.
they had a chance last year, in a case from Virginia, but they declined to hear it.
in this district, some precise and predictive detail is required, and we have some:
the location of the car, the make and model, the description of the driver were all corroborated on the scene.
Yes, the erratic driving observed was minimal, but it did support the accuracy of the tip.
it's a close call, but it goes to the Prosecution.
the Supreme Court needs to settle this once and for all.
but for now, the defendant's motion to suppress is denied.
I don't think I ever told you why your father and I were so against Mitch.
not honestly - Mom.
I have to say this, Abby. Um, I fired Charles, by the way.
we never found the ledger, but at least he's gone.
I should say thank you, but what you did was reckless.
you could have been hurt, or arrested, or I don't know what.
but you didn't even think about that.
and Mitch is the same way. We knew that even then.
you needed someone who was going to restrain those impulses, not magnify and reinforce them.
we were terrified of what was going to come of it.
and we were right. It has led to a lot of pain.
but clearly also to a lot of love.
I spent years trying to fill the hole you left when I lost you.
so yes, it's not easy for me to make room.
but I'd like to.
just let yourself in, Lou. You see this?
you wanna work for Joey Morolto? That's Antonio Cervino.
he took two in the head last night. We found him in a garbage dumpster.
he gave the Moroltos 40 years and Joey killed him because he might be disloyal.
you don't know Morolto did this. Yeah, you tell yourselves that.
you do your job, I'll do mine?" You killed him.
show some respect.
we lost a good man.
this family's in mourning.
look, I didn't kill Antonio.
that doesn't mean I'm not capable, understand?
seems to me you got what you wanted.
now you can argue Patrick was framed.
I don't think a dead man would mind.
he's not wrong, I mean, strategy-wise. This helps us, right?
yeah...
I told Joey that Antonio came to see me and he said he doesn't have permission, so...
maybe that's why. Hey, we didn't do this.
I feel like I'm going mad, Ray.
I don't wanna be melodramatic about this, but I think I'm starting to lose my mind.
you just need a good night's sleep.
you think? Absolutely, brother.
we're due. You'll see, things will start to turn around.
dad!
you're home? We're home.
emergency services.
which service to you require?
which service do you require?
Hello?
Hello, is anyone there? Hello?
I didn't... - What?
know anything.
what didn't you know?
it wasn't.
you knew.
Hello? Is anyone there? Hello?
Hello? Hello?
can you hear me? Hello?
I've just killed two people.
my aunt and my uncle.
my name's John Mercer.
how did I become a hitman for the state?
it all began five years into my life sentence and the day Lenny Douglas came to take me out of prison.
I killed my aunt and uncle because they'd hurt somebody that I love.
maybe that was what got Lenny's attention.
he liked emotions. They gave him something to manipulate.
so, while the rest watch The Champions League, you stop trying to push down the walls.
you pick up your book...
and you worry about the mystery of things.
Lenny offered me a new life.
a new home and a new family.
but there was a price.
there was the job that he wanted me to do.
Lenny Douglas ran a secret team in the war on organised crime.
I never knew who gave him his orders.
but somebody at the highest level had approved our existence.
Lenny's first trick was to reunite me with an old acquaintance.
now, how can I describe him?
take the person who annoys you the most and multiply it by ten.
you think you've left them behind.
you think you'll never have to see their face or hear their idiot voice again.
that's Calum.
Yeah! Hey!
first time I heard this tune I was in a club in San Antonio with these two mental birds Niamh and Catherine.
cousins from Burnley, mate.
everyone's a cousin in Burnley, Calum!
mate, I'm not joking. I was on the dancefloor, this tune was playing.
I had my hand up both of their skirts at the same time.
it was like I was dancing with Sooty and Sweep!
very suave, man, very suave.
Oh, mate, that will be a little surprise package I've arranged for us this evening.
but without wanting to give the game completely away...
they're twins, they're from Macedonia and.
they don't have keys.
shit.
you. Out.
Laters, bro.
rawley Park Estate, South London
mr Douglas.
no, no.
ha ha ha. John Mercer.
I'm not staying here.
where was it you two shared a cell again?
Pentonville, wasn't it?
I'm not staying here. He's an idiot.
that's a bit harsh.
granted he's no Steven Hawking.
John mate, don't be like that.
don't John mate me, please.
I'm not staying here.
you don't want to live with him?
fine. Get rid of him.
what are you doing?
well, this way you can have the flat all to yourself.
John mate, please.
I've changed a lot since then.
I'm sorry about that deodorant, mate.
just tell him you'll stay with me, please!
John! Please!
what you've got to ask yourself is do you think I won't do it?
that's the only thing that should be on your mind just now.
do you think that I won't do it?
all right.
next time we play chicken, I'll make sure the stakes are worth it.
there's some goodie bags in your room and other essentials.
are you gonna tell me who you are, then?
no, you'll have to wait until tomorrow now.
ATT: JOHN MERCER
that one.
I've always thought scarlet suited you best.
it's red and don't be so cheeky.
I thought you'd be bursting with curiosity about the new recruit.
when do I get to meet him? Oh, wait, when you decide the time is right.
you know me so well.
you're not scared he'll do a runner?
no, he's not that stupid.
so, when do you put him to work?
fortunately I do happen to have a case for him.
good. Well, let's go eat and then you can tell me all about the mysterious John Mercer.
how's the cat?
what cat would that be, Calum?
the one out of them science books you was always reading in prison.
is the cat dead? Is it not dead?
is it both dead and not dead?
you remember that?
it's clever shit. But that was always your reputation, right?
don't mess with the clever, quiet one.
why are you so negative about it all, John?
I enjoyed sharing a cell with you.
I learned a lot.
why have you got your eyes closed?
because when I open them again I'll be waking up in my nice cosy cell.
and you won't be with me.
I'm still here.
what do you do for them, Calum?
you know, pretty much what I've always done.
multitasking, bits and bobs, needles and pins.
not quite how the judge described it at your sentencing, was it?
what do they want us to do?
do the stuff the law can't do.
dealing with people the law can't reach.
come on, John, you're the clever one.
have you not worked it out yet?
check out the CVs. Who can make sure the cat is most definitely dead?
you're the specialist.
you're the killer.
morning, flatmate.
did you sleep well?
I made some breakfast.
I'd have made some for you as well but...
that was the last of the bacon.
are they always this noisy upstairs?
I like it. People enjoying themselves. Helps me get to sleep.
they're Colombians, I think.
so, what happens now, Calum?
about what?
I'm sorry. I forget you need a bit of extra help sometimes.
yesterday? I was dragged here from prison. Do you remember that?
you were nearly garroted.
Oh, that!
they wouldn't have gone through with it really.
just their idea of a little kinky game, was it?
Yeah.
I'm a bit worried he likes me too much, actually.
and so when are they gonna turn up again, Calum?
Oh, don't worry.
Lenny'll be back soon.
and that's what he does, by the way.
turns up.
doesn't always knock, either.
so, make sure you're not doing any washing up naked.
you'll be wanting to see your sister after this, I expect.
you've not even met your niece yet, have you?
is that allowed?
course it is.
you're not on the run.
licence is in order.
go ahead. Go see Jess and the kids.
I'm not a control freak.
this is where you really want me to live, is it?
you wouldn't wanna live here.
too many ghosts.
door.
this house belonged to Kevin Simmonds, a senior SOCO detective also head of Operation Merlin.
him and his wife were murdered here a few weeks ago...
while the kids were upstairs sleeping.
Yeah, the kids found the bodies. I saw something about that on the news.
Yeah, I keep forgetting they let you lot watch TV in prison.
Yeah, and we had toilet roll. It's political correctness gone mad.
they dragged Alison Simmonds out of her bed, sat her down here, forced her to watch her husband's execution.
after that he wrapped this tape around her face.
suffocated her.
must have taken a while.
the man who organised it is called Jacob Gould.
a real high flyer.
but I think he had help from the inside.
from who?
bent coppers.
they bring out the traditionalist in me.
I really don't like them.
so you're part of this Operation Merlin thing as well, are you?
no.
I'm the guy they come to when operations like Merlin go wrong.
who do you work for, then?
Oh, now, there's a question.
officially, nobody, of course.
I'm on sick leave from the police.
post traumatic stress.
Yeah, and unofficially?
I don't really think that's any of your concern.
my job's to disorganise crime.
illegally.
I prefer to use the world irregular.
Yeah, yeah, I bet you do.
look at that. Bobbies on bikes.
everybody loves a bobby on a bike.
unfortunately a million extra bobbies on bikes couldn't deal with Jacob Gould.
operation Merlin couldn't deal with him either.
what do you want from me?
you're going to kill him for me.
niece and nephew, right?
Yeah.
I haven't got 'em any presents, though.
a bit behind when it comes to computer games and stuff like that.
you should talk to me.
CDs, DVDs, video games.
steve can get anything in that department.
no, John, that'd be irresponsible!
that's not their age range at all!
how did it go with Lenny?
Yeah, pretty good, really.
he wants me to become an assassin for the state.
I guess that's what you did in the Army, right?
wrong.
that was legal.
Yeah.
then you whacked your aunt and uncle.
shut up, Calum.
I'm just saying.
at least with Lenny you know it's someone who probably deserves it.
not just some scared kid in a trench.
I didn't fight in the trenches, Calum.
you wouldn't be going to see your sister if Lenny hadn't got you out of prison.
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do it.
OK.
he can find himself another hitman.
I'm sure.
OK, kids, lunch is ready.
you should get yourself a new map.
Nah. This is my only school prize.
the names are out of date.
I know.
but the old maps are the best.
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that's a brilliant name for a country.
are you gonna talk to me?
what do you wanna know?
how did you get out so early?
where you're living now.
what you're planning on doing with your life.
I'm out on licence.
living in a kind of halfway house.
my life? I don't know, Jess, you're gonna have to give me a little bit more time on that one.
is that it?
of course it's not it.
I did it for you.
no.
I killed them for you.
you did it for yourself.
why did you write to me, then, Jess?
because I love you. And you were the only person I could turn to.
you're all I've got right now, Jess.
promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
I promise.
promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
are you ready?
one condition.
just this. Then we're done.
I'll talk to Calum.
he'll get you everything you need.
you talking to me?
you what? You what? Haha haha!
check this, yo.
don't point a gun at me ever again.
Where'd you get it?
who's Kosovan Kate.
she works with the Albanians.
here. You need to wear these.
give the old bill an head start.
so she's setting up her own people, is she?
mate, I don't know how much you know about that part of the world but they treat women in a very degrading way.
dealing with you must have made a nice change for her.
she noshed me off for free so that tells you something.
Yeah, it certainly does.
Lenny wants it done at the airfield.
problem is, isn't there a lot of CCTV down there?
entrances, lobbies.
exit to runways, manager's office.
there's a blind spot in the toilets which could be a good thing.
it's the one thing everyone does before they get on a plane.
didn't you say the front entrance was covered?
Yeah, I can get you in a different way.
how?
did a Duke of Edinburgh climbing course on my pupil referral unit.
what was my nickname inside?
spider, right?
not the nickname I heard.
Grantham Hill Private Airfield.
we're done.
I'm gonna go and stay with my sister now.
I assume that we never meet again which is a tragedy I'll just have to learn to live with.
here are the keys to the flat.
we're not finished yet.
we had an agreement, Lenny.
Yeah, but I think you overestimated your ability to insist on deal breakers though.
you gave me an undertaking.
to review.
so consider it under review.
OK. Fine. Send me back to prison, then, please.
we can do that.
well, then, do it.
only this time it's for life.
I'll make sure of it.
you were never gonna set me free, were you?
don't be so ungrateful, John.
I've even authorised your mobile to make outgoing calls.
this is freedom, isn't it?
Oh, mate.
you're not gonna believe this.
I've only cracked it with one of them Colombian chicks from upstairs.
big beautiful brown eyes.
mate, I have got a strong feeling that before long, Manuela that's her name she's gonna be down here dancing a cumbia on the end of my bed.
chill out.
no.
because I've heard it all before.
no, I can't do this any more, Richard.
just leave me alone, OK?
sorry.
don't be.
well, other people's rows...
Oh, they're great, they're very entertaining.
especially ones where there's shouting in the street.
well, we're done with the shouting.
is that why you're here?
Yeah. I left him.
poor guy.
he messed up.
stupid guy.
well, I like to think of myself as the easygoing type but...
well, there are some things that can never be forgiven.
tell me about it.
my name's John, by the way.
I'm Rose.
take her all my money, tell her buy some pretty clothes.
that's a song.
don't forget to give my love to Rose.
be nice if somebody would.
would you like another drink?
so, where are you heading?
Patagonia.
travelling light.
well, you don't need much stuff out there, do you?
just a change of clothes and a bottle of whisky.
I don't have any whisky, actually.
Oh, no?
well, then, you lured me here.
under false pretences.
just a lie to get you into my room.
cunning.
but unnecessary.
sorry.
I might need this to replace the pretty clothes you ripped off me last night.
you work for them.
good luck.
so what now, John?
how do you see this playing now?
you tell me.
well, not such an elaborate routine next time you run away.
why did you this time?
I'm always curious as far as you're concerned.
you said you wanted to go back to prison.
Yeah.
I'll take my chances.
they're not good, to be honest.
and, of course, that kind of decision has an effect on others.
you and your sister.
you were separated when your parents died, weren't you?
you entered the chaos of the care system and Jess went to live with aunt and uncle.
who raped her repeatedly and had neighbours hold the camcorders.
incredible what goes on behind the net curtains in this nation of ours.
robert and Abby, they seem contented little kids.
I'm sure they'd rather be together, being looked after by your sister.
is he fast?
cos I'd put money on me ripping out your windpipe before he can take a couple of steps.
I would, too.
that's partly the reason you're here, isn't it?
you're a class act, aren't you?
no, I'm a necessity.
destroy the lives of innocent people just to keep me your slave.
stop being so melodramatic.
you may learn to love me first.
Well...what do you want?
I want you to watch the undercover cop I mentioned to you.
his name is Iain Risdale.
I think he betrayed Operation Merlin and was involved in his commanding officer's death.
the man smells of corruption.
things will work out just fine, John.
one simple rule worth remembering.
I call the shots.
Oh, yes!
what I wasn't gonna tell ya!
Si, oh, si!
TV: "Police have arrested two Albanian men in connection with the murder of British businessman Jacob Gould.
Gould had stepped down from the daytoday running of his shipping and cargo businesses after being continually linked with the illegal arms trade.
police confirmed Mr Gould was being investigated by undercover officers as part of Operation Merlin's attempt to target illegal gunrunning networks in Britain.
the killing could be linked to an attempt by Albanian mafia to control the gunrunning business in London.
where are you from again?
hampshire CID.
I'm part of the external review of Operation Merlin.
we allowed Jacob Gould to stay in business, then we go after him.
now, what's that about?
well, us allowing Gould some leeway for certain strategic reasons is information you might want to lose from your hard drive.
you're joking.
knowledge is power in this game.
well, I must admit, talking to yourself and others, it seems your boss had something of an ego.
putting Gould away became an obsession for him.
it did seem that way to me at the time.
must have thought his name was Kevin Costner not Simmonds.
have you seen that film?
what film?
the Untouchables.
great film.
it's a great film.
you should watch it. Sean Connery.
they put one of ours in a hospital, we put one of theirs in a morgue.
right. - Iain...
a green light's on in the car like a little green exclamation mark.
probably needs a service.
it's brand new.
thanks for your time. Nice house.
do you want a hand buttoning up?
one of the few men I can trust not to grab my arse.
so what's the deal with the Merlin undercover?
Risdale? He unfortunately reminded me that knowledge is power.
pack him off to Magaluf.
he can sell dodgy pills from his bar with the rest of the bent coppers.
maybe.
it's a funny thing to sell your soul for...
a new beamer.
Yeah. Cars have never really done it for me.
well, what has?
apart from your work, of course.
my work's enough.
and now you have a new toy.
one you gave the full VIP treatment to, I'm told.
you gave me the impression he was very important.
we could have hauled him in at the hotel.
I know that.
do you mind if I ask why?
poor man had been in prison for five years.
that's very charitable of you.
and aren't you always telling me that the stick is a weapon for the short term?
I'm glad somebody listens to me.
we'd best hope he doesn't fall for you.
he's more likely to try and kill me.
and why should you care?
glittering in a place where a heart should be.
go and make a drink.
why are we watching this geezer?
because Lenny hasn't decided what to do with him yet.
neighbours used to have loads of them in the garden.
with fishing rods.
little ones.
sitting on mushrooms.
mum said it lowered the tone.
gnomes.
I don't like gnomes.
also I don't like fireeaters.
and I don't like dried fruit of any kind.
and I don't like those big mental dogs that come running at you in parks.
I mean, you wouldn't let a lion or crocodile run loose in Regent's Park, would you?
say some things you don't like. - Shut up, Calum.
I'm bored.
look, surveillance is boring.
there's a pair of jays in that tree, if you look.
big thrill.
you know who really loves the countryside?
Nonces.
it makes it easier to grab the kids.
you always hear about weird shit like that happening in places like this.
that's more like it.
that's the undercover's wife.
ticking my boxes.
I'd go under the covers with her.
but there's only one thing that comes before a lady.
my dinner. I'm starving.
I'd eat those two jays in a sesame seed bun.
I'll get us something to eat, then we'll start working in shifts.
Why?
because if we don't, I'm gonna start garroting you myself.
don't be like that, John.
come on, mate.
what kind of bag?
I dunno.
a bag bag.
was it a suitcase or an overnight bag?
Yeah, that's it. An overnight bag.
he goes out for a jog, like you said, and then...
he comes back out with a bag.
what was I supposed to do?
did anything happen to spook him?
did he see you?
of course not.
what?
if we mess this up, they will find you dead of an overdose and I'll be back in prison waiting for someone to stab me in the showers
better hope he hasn't gone far, Calum.
what do you mean a runner?
just took off all of a sudden.
find him for me.
and then what?
operation Merlin's all but dead and buried.
I want him dealt with, John.
and this time no guns.
John, I finally cracked it.
it's churros.
what are you talking about?
those Spanish doughnut things you dip in hot chocolate after you've been out all night.
so again last night, the wife got a call around 10: 30.
it's the husband calling to say good night.
exactly.
he's always calling.
they must like each other.
so we need to get in, get the number without her knowing about it.
how?
we need a woman.
like Mr Ray Charles says...
we've got a woman.
you must be joking if you think...
John, how many other birds do you know?
we meet again.
thanks again for everything you did to help me.
Oh, don't just thank me.
how else would I know which hotel you'd be in?
which amoeba, scratching his crutch, not a million miles away, might know that you kept your private stuff hidden behind a map of the world?
and tell Lenny when you were leaving?
what is it you do for them again, Calum, you miserable little snitch?
I got used to having your big, cheery smile around.
didn't want to see you leave.
and what do they have on you?
I'm guessing that sex with strangers in hotels wasn't really top of your career list.
it wasn't.
advance warning.
I'm getting ready to do a runner as well.
well, as long as it's not in my direction, Calum.
I was once a police officer.
I bet you looked lovely in that uniform, PC Rose.
was Lenny your guv?
undercover, actually.
so do you think you can get us into the house?
Yeah, I think I might just be up to it.
sweet.
Oh, that's the front door.
darling, I'll speak to you tomorrow.
OK?
I'm awfully sorry to disturb you.
that's all right.
it's just that I've broken down just down the road and, well, wouldn't you know it, the bloody mobile.
would you mind if I borrowed your phone to call the AA?
erm, You'll have to tell me where I am.
of course. Come inside.
thank you.
you're an absolute angel.
last number to call the house and last number dialled.
how was she?
what's that mean?
did she seem suspicious or anything?
a bit trusting.
I wouldn't let anybody into my house, whatever their sob story.
that's cos you're a hardfaced bitch.
sorry.
while you steal credit cards from lonely and vulnerable women.
just a moment of madness?
no, that was just a cheap whore in a bar.
well, don't be too hard on yourself.
it had been a while, hadn't it?
which showed.
sorry, guys.
I'd advise you two to get a room, but it seems you already have.
shut up, Calum.
now sit nice and try not to lick the windows.
Hello? Is that the Long Bay Hotel?
can you put me through to Iain Risdale, please?
Yeah. Yeah, that's him. - Hey, John, check the words to this.
yo! And I ain't chatting no black talk, mate.
yo means I in Spanish.
very impressive. - There's more.
yo no soy marinero.
I ain't no sailor.
soy capitan. I'm captain.
I've found Risdale.
to dance La Bamba, what do you need?
una poca de gracia.
shut up!
for once in your stupid and pointless life, shut up.
I'm in love, mate.
do you know what it feels like to be in love? Have you ever been in love?
seriously, John, that ain't a trick question.
have you ever loved anybody?
anybody whose name isn't Mercer?
we're going to the seaside.
pack a bag.
mi amor, Calum.
mi gusto los churros a los chico.
you forget about the sea sometimes.
Yeah.
it reminds me of biscuits.
Really? Why's that?
when we were just little kids, my dad used to take us to the seaside.
me and my sister would sit in the back eating digestive biscuits.
John, listen...
I've never done what you do.
I know.
just ask him for the time.
or a light, or whatever.
you can do that.
I'll do the rest.
do you want some fudge?
I've eaten tonnes.
I'd better save some for Manuela.
you OK?
I feel a bit...
Yeah. Yeah.
can you...stop the car.
stop the car.
it's done.
are either of the kid's fathers gonna turn up to this dance of theirs?
Abby's dad sends money in a card each birthday.
Rob's dad, nothing at all.
I could come if you want.
to the dance.
they'd love that.
they think you're great, you know?
rob said you were cool.
got some catching up to do.
like you said, you're not going anywhere, right?
they're good kids, Jess.
you've done a brilliant job with them.
I can't find my shoe anywhere.
I'll need it for the beach.
this is freedom, isn't it?
one simple rule worth remembering.
I call the shots.
not watching porn or playing one of your computer games, Calum?
couldn't sleep.
Yeah. Me, neither.
when we was in the car, my breathing went all funny.
couldn't get air into my lungs.
that's panic.
know the best way of controlling that?
singing.
if you sing to yourself, it controls stuff inside, takes your mind off stuff.
sing what?
dunno.
not sure the lyrics make much difference overall, Calum.
you're Beautiful by James Blunt, maybe.
that's an underrated song, John.
much darker than you think.
like, he freely admits he was high.
and once the beautiful angel he was after spotted that...
the curtains closed for them.
got to sort the ladies out first, Blunty.
everybody knows that.
that, or La Bamba.
remember what you need to dance the Bamba, Calum.
feet.
do you want a bacon sandwich?
Yeah, all right.
I'll stick the grill on, you nip down the shop and get the bacon.
what? That's fair.
and if them hoodies on the corner start getting fierce, just dance La Bamba in front of them.
there is one thing that is totally and utterly certain in this life.
and that is you will never see me dance.
I'll put money on it.
one day, you'll dance.
who's that out there?
don't think I care for you.
I just need you alive.
what do you mean, he's gone?
argument about the M25 got out of hand.
an argument with the M25?
you can't leave me here on my own.
I don't know who to go to, Rose.
no sign of him leaving Mercer's flat.
I'll have to tell Lenny.
you'll sign Calum's death warrant.
somebody's lying to me.
what's given can be taken away.
Calum, let's discuss Jude's disappearance again, shall we?
Hey, Pete. You have a good one.
see you tomorrow, Pete.
where is everybody?
Oh, my God!
call it in! Signal 63! Get some help now!
...where he was a professor of literature.
so far, 5 guards are confirmed deadfrom this prison escape.
...from prison early this morning.
as you may recall, Carroll was convicted in 2004 for the murders of 14 young women who attended the university where he was a professor of literature...
Hello? - Hello, Ryan.
it's Director Franklin, FBI.
it's been a while.
Yeah. What can I do for you, sir?
we need you in Virginia, Ryan.
I'm not an agent anymore.
I know things didn't end well with the Bureau, but you caught Carroll.
no one knows him like you do.
I've got good agents on it.
go consult, educate them.
we have to find him fast.
so far, 5 guards are confirmed dead from the prison escape.
Joe Carroll still out - Will you do it, Ryan?
detective Warren, Norfolk PD.
we're here on behalf of the US Marshals Office.
okay. What's going on?
Joe Carroll-- he escaped from prison earlier this morning.
I'm sorry. He what?
and where was the knife at this point, the knife that was used to stab you repeatedly?
it was still inside me.
I reached down to pull it out, but I was too weak.
so what did you do?
I pushed it instead deeper into my stomach and to the right.
and why would you do that?
to puncture the splenic artery, to bleed out faster.
I just wanted it to be over.
I have men in place both inside and out.
strictly precautionary.
gonna keep you safe, Miss Fuller.
can't let you in! I'm her neighbor Will Wilson.
he's okay-- Sarah!
I saw the news.
it's all over TV.
look. Billy's on his way home, all right?
we're here for you, whatever you need.
I'm so glad you're here.
come here.
Ryan Harding, Agent Troy Riley, BAU2.
this is Agent Jennifer Mason.
thank you for coming.
I'm not sure what Franklin told you, but the Marshals are heading the ground search, and we're running point for the Bureau.
we got a command center set up in town.
now your being here may raise some eyebrows.
that book you wrote.
not to mention my reputation.
just keep your head down, we'll do the talking.
if anyone asks, you're here strictly as a consultant.
any questions?
Yeah. How's Sarah Fuller?
Carroll's last victim.
she's a doctor now in Norfolk.
she sav-- Yes. She's under 247 watch.
I'd like to speak to her.
about what?
I'd like to know how she's doing.
perhaps later when we're not trying to find a serial killer.
he kills all of them in under two minutes, and there he goes.
Ryan Hardy, this is Deputy Marshal Scott Turner.
I know Ryan.
I was with the Sheriff's Office when he brought Carroll in.
Scott. - Director Franklin asked Mr. Hardy to consult.
then he's your problem, Agent.
he left it like this.
forensics swept. Nothing.
he's scheduled to be executed next month.
the 12th.
still a romantic.
who let him have this?
anyone could have.
dear Ryan, I enjoyed your book.
have you ever considered a sequel? Best, Joe.
you never mentioned a note.
any idea why he left that for you?
he enjoyed my book.
he said so.
I think he's letting us know that he plans to kill again.
Yeah. That's probably it.
look. I read your file. I know you don't play well with others.
you read my file? - Yes, I did!
so you know me, is that what it is?
forget it.
Claire Matthews, Carroll's ex-wife.
has anyone been in touch with her?
she's being questioned.
we have her under protection, as well.
sorry for the intrusion, Miss Matthews. I have a few questions.
when was the last time your husband contacted you?
ex-husband, and I don't mean to be rude, Detective, but I'm gonna wait for the FBI to arrive, and I need to speak to Ryan Hardy.
thank you.
so how'd it go?
it's official. I'm pregnant.
mom! Mom!
Yeah. Yeah, honey.
what's going on?
why can't I watch TV?
I didn't know what to say.
um... It's dad, isn't it?
Oh, honey.
I need to speak to someone about Joe Carroll.
fill this out, take a seat with the others.
he then studied in the States, where he married and became a professor of literature at Winslow University.
also, budding novelist. In , Carroll's first and only novel "The Gothic Sea" was published.
it would go on to become a best-seller, but in its initial printing, it was a commercial and critical flop.
this triggered his piquerism, the act of stabbing, slicing flesh for arousal.
that's not accurate.
I'm sorry. Would you like to say something, sir?
by all means, if I've got it wrong, please correct me.
Joe Carroll was obsessed with the Romantic period.
his lectures consisted of Thoreau, Emerson, in particular his hero Edgar Allen Poe, and like Poe, he believed in the insanity of art, that it had to be... felt.
he didn't just eviscerate 14 female students.
he was making art.
he cut out his victims' eyes as a nod to his favorite works of Poe, "The Tell-Tale Heart" and "The Black Cat.
see, Poe believed the eyes are our identity, windows to our soul.
to classify him as a piquerist would be... too simplistic.
okay, guys. Thanks.
Mike Weston.
it's a real honor, sir.
did my thesis on Joe Carroll at the academy.
your book was-- it was invaluable.
it's a real thrill for me, sir. - Hardy.
that was pathetic. - Man is a hero.
took down Carroll single-handed.
and the Bureau still let him go.
you haven't read his book, have you?
he's on disability.
Turner said he lost it, went crazy.
no. Carroll stabbed him in the chest, punctured his left ventricular.
he can't be in the field anymore.
he's got a pacemaker keeping it all pumping.
who are the women?
Carroll's groupies.
we're interviewing anyone who visited Carroll in prison.
Carroll had 112 visitors in the last two years, 43 in the last 6 months.
14 visited over 4 times.
who had the most access to him?
was he confined to his cell, did he have any privileges?
most of his time was spent preparing for his third appeal.
he'd foregone legal aid and was representing himself.
his records.
so he had access to a legal library?
Yeah. Every Tuesday, Carroll was shackled and transported to the Sussex County law library, where he was confined to a sealed room, one guard.
and furnished with law books.
actual books or digital files?
digital. Everything's archived on the library's server.
so he had internet access.
it would have been restricted.
because that would stop Joe Carroll?
damn it! We need to rip apart the library's ethernet! - Get the cyber techs in here.
weapon! She's got a weapon! Stand back!
take it easy, ma'am, easy, easy, easy, easy. Easy, easy.
drop the weapon! Drop the weapon! Drop it!
ma'am, ma'am, look at me, look at me, look at me.
you don't want to do this, okay?
just... just hand that thing to me, and everything's gonna be okay.
Lord, help my poor soul.
no. - Lord... help my poor soul.
no, no.
she's right-handed.
she did most of the upper left region herself, but this is someone else.
Carroll possibly.
we're running analysis for a match.
thank you.
once upon a midnight dreary." "The Raven.
this fever called living is conquered at last.
it's all Poe.
and what she said at theend- - Yeah. Poe's last words.
when found delirious on the streets of Baltimore, he's believed to have uttered, "Lord, help my poor soul.
is that water, sir? - Yes.
mint? - Sure.
we've run her prints.
so far, we've found 7 identities.
4 of them are wanted in 3 states, and 2 of them visited Carroll repeatedly in the last 6 months.
anything on the cell phone?
disposable.
the text said,"Do it now.
Carroll could easily convince an unbalanced brain to do this.
it's an exertion of power, theatrics.
I have Sarah Fuller for you.
Hello?
Mr. Hardy, it's been a long time.
Sarah, hi.
how you doing?
well, not great.
listen. We're gonna find him.
nothing is gonna happen to you, I promise you that.
I really appreciate you calling.
I'm just, um, happy to hear you're safe.
bye-bye now.
good-bye, Mr. Hardy.
thank you.
they questioned Claire Matthews.
she won't speak to anyone but you. Why is that?
when I speak to her, I'll ask her.
Thanks.
I really don't think you got enough food, babe.
do we really have to feed the cops?
I mean, can't they just order pizza?
there's plenty of food.
thank you, Billy.
so how's she doing?
she's right here.
she's fine.
well, then why are we ignoring that hot cop candy in the corner over there?
is he single or what?
he's not wearing a ring. I checked.
...beloved by his students, and with his charm and good looks, he was understandably a favorite amongst the female contingent.
so Poe's chief principle, insanity as art.
this is the Romantic period.
death is about theme, mood, motif, emotional aesthetic.
Poe equates death with what?
he equates death with love?
no, not love.
Poe equates death with...
beauty.
Poe believed that art was about beauty and that nothing was more beautiful than the death of a beautiful woman
and to bereave beauty is...
to elevate one's soul.
Carroll never visited same web address twice, which suggests he's using various URLs.
who with?
well, there's the rub. Every time I access an IP address, it mutates.
this is a fairly sophisticated virus.
where were the guards when he was sitting there chatting online?
who are these idiots?
the detail changed, but there's one recurring name.
I got it. 32, 4-year employee, death row, works the night shift.
was he working last night?
uh... Called in sick.
that's him. - Prison guard.
he helped Carroll escape. - Get his home address.
Yeah. I got it.
federal agents. Open up!
hit it.
clear the room! - Room clear!
all clear!
he's not here.
say hi to the camera. - Guys.
say hi. Say hi.
can you say hi to your friends?
Yeah. Say hi.
your friends are out there.
that's right, buddy.
Oh, sweet pup.
you're gonna want to see this.
what is that?
it's a German shepherd, I think.
he's been practicing.
Carroll was teaching him how to become a serial killer.
I can handle dead people.
you kill a dog, I go crazy.
I got this little terrier mix.
forget it.
what is that?
it's Joe Carroll's novel.
Oh, look. It's inscribed.
Jordy, you're capable of greatness. You just have to believe. Joe.
so this Jordy guy, is lonely, he's unstable, vulnerable to kindness.
Carroll recognizes his potential and seduces him.
he's emulating Carroll.
the animals, he removed their eyes.
well, Jordy looks to Carroll the way Carroll looks to Poe.
it's a godlike kind of worship.
is Carroll really that powerful?
well, you know, when I first started to suspect him, all I had was instinct.
I didn't have any evidence at all.
I was having a hard time convincing people of my Poe theory.
in the book, that's when you started following him.
Yeah. Everywhere.
home, work, school.
I was just waiting for him to get sloppy.
that's when I first recognized Sarah Fuller.
I'd seen her in his class.
I used to sit there and watch him teach.
you know, he was amazing.
he could inspire people.
it's a gift.
hardy, let's go.
where to?
it's time you talked to Claire Matthews.
no official word at this time, but sources have confirmed to us that woman is dead today by her own hands.
now the FBI is speculating the victim may have been one of Joe Carroll's groupies...
enough of that.
I say we watch a movie.
actually, I think I'm just gonna lie day for a little bit if it's ok with you guys.
Yeah.
that's even a better idea.
you should get some rest.
we're right next door, okay?
you call us if you need anything, all right?
we'll come running.
I love you guys.
love you. - Good night.
all right. - Let's go.
you want me to have manners?
that was creepy.
whole night's been creepy.
Yeah.
it's so quiet.
because everyone's in Daytona having fun, everyone but us.
the hangover has begun.
told you not to drink.
I'm not interesting enough to not drink.
you okay?
No!
sorry.
just to let you know, there's two officers outside the door if you need them.
sure. Thank you.
Claire will be right down.
Hey, Joey. - Do I know you?
Yeah, but I haven't seen you since you were this big.
let's let the man do his job.
professor Matthews. - Yes?
I'm Agent Ryan Hardy, FBI. Can I speak with you?
sure.
I didn't know about the eyes. - It was with held.
try Edgar Allen Poe.
Um,"The Tell-Tale Heart," "The Black Cat" both have strong eye allegories.
the eyes are symbolic, the essence of identity.
you should talk to my husband.
he knows a lot about that time period.
you're married.
Yeah. Yes, I'm married, Agent Hardy.
Why? Are we flirting?
with this material, no, not a chance.
Hello, Ryan.
I'm Agent Mason, Miss Matthews.
I understand you wanted to speak to Mr. Hardy.
Yes, but I need to speak with him alone, please.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
I'm afraid I have to insist.
would you excuse us for a minute?
how's your heart?
same.
but you're drinking too much.
have you heard from him? - Yeah.
a week ago, this came for me.
I thought you should see it.
how does he know?
he doesn't. He's guessing.
no one needs to know about this. It's not gonna help us find him.
we have two killers out there now.
he's got help.
are you a cop?
Joe's always teaching.
it was ingrained in him, so that makes sense.
it makes sense he would find a student.
where do you think they would go?
would he leave the country? - No. Joe's not looking for his freedom.
he wants to keep killing.
Yeah. He's good at it.
I need to find him, Claire, and I don't think I know how.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
it's been 8 years, Ryan. I got the hint.
I mean, I know-- I know that when the FBI found out about us that was difficult for you.
no. That's not why I didn't call.
you deserve more.
I belong in your past.
I work better in people's pasts, I always have.
uh, the girl safe?
the last victim, she's-- Sarah Fuller.
uh, yeah, she's under protection.
she's good. She's a doctor now.
I'm glad someone was able to get beyond this.
I'm sure that upsets Joe.
Why's that?
he fancies himself Edgar Allen Poe.
that was the impetus for writing his novel.
Poe died with an unfinished manuscript,"The Lighthouse," and Joe's novel "The Gothic Sea" was sort of his way of finishing what Poe started.
what was that about in there?
it was personal.
what do you mean personal?
we have to get to Sarah Fuller.
what did she tell you?
Carroll is gonna make a move.
he wants to finish what he started.
that would be Sarah.
it's right this way.
I'm Detective Warren.
miss Fuller went to bed about an hour ago.
officer Pontz works the front door.
another officer here.
two men upstairs.
officers!
where are they?
officer Watts.
Kelly, where are you guys?
they should be here.
she's gone.
where is she?
where the hell is she? - I don't know!
how did she get out of here?
we got an officer down. We got an officer down.
go around. Come on. Neighbors next door.
let's go.
give me a light.
get the lights. Get the lights!
so the neighbors Will Wilson and Billy Thomas left in their SUV 40 minutes ago.
no one thought to search the vehicle?
there was no reason to check.
she wasn't missing.
will Wilson teaches public school, second grade.
Billy Thomas as is a computer tech.
he runs the fraud division of a regional bank.
and I bet they weren't gay either.
Carroll placed them here to watch over her until he was ready.
come on. They've been her neighbors for 3 years.
she'd never suspect them, and now they're taking her straight to Carroll.
he's finding people to help him do it on the damn internet.
it-- it's like they're his followers.
I'm not buying two men would pretend to be gay and shack up next to a woman because some nut job told them to.
prison guard worships him, ice pick lady is brainwashed to kill herself.
these two guys have dedicated years of their lives to him.
there's some kind of fanatical obsession at play here.
it's like it's a cult. It's
Nevermore." "The Raven.
Poe is symbolizing the finality of death.
have you pulled the GPS?
where are the satellites?
I knew you'd show up eventually.
do something! - This is the Hardy I remember.
how many checkpoints have you set up?
get him out of here! - Don't just stand there!
move! - Hardy!
back off, dude. - Sorry, sorry.
come on, Sarah.
God. - You don't have to be rude.
sorry, sir. - Come on.
God.
there's a killer on the loose, and you want me to have manners?
that was creepy.
the whole night's been creepy.
Yeah.
behind you.
what do you got?
well, both men were listed in the prison's visitor log.
you got a file on these guys.
nothing except some property records in Lake Whitehurst.
I came alone, Joe
isn't that what you wanted?
No! No! No! No! No! No!
No! No! No!
Hello, Ryan.
I was curious to see how your heart was holding up.
I see it has its limits.
where is she?
you know, the human eye is connected by 7 muscles.
I removed each one individually.
you know how hard that is to do?
No! No!
no-- No! No!
you know how I love my little souvenirs.
No! No!
she lasted much longer than I thought she would.
she's quite the fighter.
I'd like to turn myself in.
I surrender. I surrender!
stop! Hardy!
I surrender. Come on.
get off. Off him, off him. Get off him.
I surrender.
No! - I surrender.
Carroll's en route to Richmond.
he'll be placed in federal detention until this is all over.
18 months I worked the case, couldn't crack it.
I made so many mistakes.
but Sarah...
I saved her.
how'd you know he'd be here?
Carroll's book was inspired by Poe's last unfinished work"The Lighthouse.
Sarah was his unfinished work.
Yeah. He wanted to get the ending right.
Joe Carroll had 47 dedicated web sites, over a thousand blogs, chat rooms, online forums.
could have multiple resources.
he'll only talk to you.
Sarah had to die, Ryan.
I know it's sad.
it's tragic. Poor thing.
she worked very hard to get her life back together, and she'd done quite nicely, which is more than I can say for some.
Oh, you've been quite the disappointment, Ryan.
now I never expected you capable of "in cold blood," but what was it with the true crime drivel?
so what's my sequel about Joe?
everyone outside is anxious to know.
well... it's going to be a collaboration.
we're gonna write this together, Ryan.
my first book was clearly too avant garde, lost in literati pretense.
now my new story... will play to a much wider audience.
hell, even Poe whored himself out eventually.
so the prison guard, the gay neighbors, how do they figure into your new plot?
we know about the cult.
I'm not a big fan of that word.
I like to think of them as my friends.
it's important to have friends, Ryan.
did you know that the FBI estimates that up to 300 serial killers are active in the US on any given day?
sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.
is everything ok?
extra patrol this evening.
I thought they caught him. I saw it on the news.
still, mind if I look around, check your doors and windows?
do you have any friends, Ryan?
come on in.
I think everyone's asleep.
I will be your friend even though you slept with my wife.
there is breaking news tonight from Waverly, Virginia, where serial killer Joe Carroll has finally been caught.
the escaped convict was found at an abandoned
did she show you the letter?
what's he talking about? What letter?
Claire is very important, Ryan.
every good story needs a love interest.
I'm going to bed.
good night. - Good night.
she's the only woman I've ever truly loved. She's the mother of my son.
and I'd like to see her.
no. She'd never agree to that.
she might just change her mind about that.
Joey? Joey?! Where is he?
I thought I might go more traditional this time, you know, villain, good versus evil.
I need a strong protagonist so that the reader can truly invest, a flawed, broken man searching for redemption, and that is you.
you are my flawed hero.
Yes, I ensured that by killing Sarah.
she was the inciting incident, the hero's call to action.
this is merely the prologue, this is just the beginning.
that was the entire point of Sarah's death.
it was for you.
if this book ends with anything other than your death, you better plan on a rewrite.
guards! Guards!
Joey, honey, where are you?
Where's Denise?
Denise? Where is-- where is Denise?
guards!
that's enough! - Where's my son?
Joey! Joey, where are you?
call Claire.
it's just the beginning.
it will be a classic.
it will be our masterpiece.
call Claire. Call Claire!
we need you in Virginia, Ryan.
I'm not an agent anymore.
you caught Carroll. No one knows him like you do.
so what's my sequel about, Joe?
we're gonna write this together, Ryan.
even though you slept with my wife.
I have so many surprises waiting for you.
he fancies himself Edgar Allan Poe.
that was the impetus for writing his novel.
we got more bodies.
he removed the eyes, Carroll's signature.
he used this prison guard to gain access to the internet to create a cult.
agent Parker's taking the lead.
cults, my specialty.
ice pick lady, gay neighbors, and the nanny, how do they figure into your new plot?
where is he? Joey? Where is my son?!
Carroll knows where the kid is.
he's not gonna tell us. - He might tell his wife.
you son of a bitch, where's my son?
take thy beak from out of my heart, and take thy form from off my door.
quoth the raven "nevermore.
and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting...
if you don't like the piece, call my editor, scream at him.
it is too early for this crap. You have a nice day.
lies floating on the floor shall be lifted-- nevermore!
what the hell?!
good morning, Claire.
good morning, ma'am. - Is Ryan Hardy here?
no, ma'am. He left over an hour ago.
dederal detention center. richmond, virginia
how'd you sleep? That motel they stuck us in sucks.
the bed is bricks.
how many fingerprints? - 9 in total.
several were older prints, but upstairs in the attic room, that is where we found 6 sets.
they're the newest ones we found.
I'm guessing that's where they gathered most.
4 of the sets belong to Emma, Jacob, Paul, and Jordy.
Yeah. That's 4. The guy with the Poe mask that attacked me. - 5.
you really think that this cult is limited to 6 people?
we weren't supposed to find their little clubhouse.
I tell you, there's got to be something here that will tell us where Joey Matthews is.
I've been through every piece of it.
nothing points to where he is or why they took him.
I want to understand what this cult is about.
I mean, what's Carroll's message?
koresh, Jones, Manson-- they all used mind control to reinforce their message of family and unity over the individual.
didn't Manson convince his family to kill for his own selfish needs?
Yeah, but he dressed it up in several different motives at once.
he'd test his followers with acts of murder in order to prove their devotion.
he was a brilliant manipulator, get anyone to do anything.
Joe was a teacher.
he was a man of ideas, and he was brilliant at it.
I witnessed him at class he could engage and inspire his students in ways that I'd never seen before.
hester had broken free from all of that.
she had-- she had created her own moral code.
are we not able to break free and
and do whatever we want as long as we are willing to pay life's consequences?
what is-- what is your moral code?
make it unique unto yourself, and it will bleed into your writing.
Yeah. Thank you.
how's your bedside manner? Jordy's awake.
Jordy. How you feeling?
how am I feeling? You shot me.
Yeah. Sorry about that.
tell us where Joey Matthews is.
is that all?
do you think I'm stupid?
I'm not talking.
I think you're looking at the death penalty.
I'll never make it to the chair.
I'm a correctional officer.
I won't last a week in prison, but can I tell you a little secret?
it was worth it to kill those girls, to hold them in my hands while they died, felt their last breath.
you know I talked to Joe, right?
he was very upset to find out that you were still alive.
he wanted you dead. You failed.
you were supposed to kill Claire Matthews. Weren't those the rules?
I know what you're doing.
it's not gonna work. - Come on, Jordy.
Where's Joey?
I can't hear you.
look at what's happened to me - Come on. Just tell us where
I can't believe it myself suddenly I'm up on top of the world - Jordy!
should have been somebody else - Sorry. I slipped. - You can't do that!
you can't do that! No, no, no, no!
sorry for the shaky cam. It's from a witness' cell.
what are we watching?
street performance by a man dressed as Poe early this morning.
recognize the mask?
he was doing this on the street? - It's very common.
it's the historical district, and here it comes.
wait. Who's the victim?
Stan Fellows, book critic. - Yeah. Richmond paper.
I know this guy. I interviewed him for my book.
he wrote a scathing review of Carroll's book "The Gothic Sea.
it was the worst I read. - Suspect threw confetti on the crowd.
it's got writing on it.
generous Critic fann'd the Poet's fire, and taught the world with reason to admire."That's Poe.
so Carroll wants his followers to exact revenge on his critics?
that could take a while.
the recent string of murders in the wake of
Joe Carroll's prison escape is raising all kinds of speculation.
is this the work of a cult?
the press is officially calling us a cult, but the FBI won't confirm it, so they've issued a media blackout.
that's because they're completely clueless.
have you talked to Emma? - No. No. Why?
things are weird between you guys, and to be fair, you haven't been that nice to her.
is that Rick? - Awesome!
look. Here's some cool footage of the fire.
so-- so torch man's a hit, huh?
I knew it would work.
if you hate blood so much, what about fire? It's flashy.
I don't hate blood.
what about removing the eyes?
you can't do that with fire.
actually you can, doofus.
what Jordy means is the eyes are Joe's signature.
fire doesn't go with gouging eyes.
you're being literal.
besides, we're supposed to find our own voice, not just copy Joe's story, doofus deux.
I like Joe's story. - Then have at it, Jordy.
you do it your way, I'll do it mine.
just talk to Emma, okay? - You don't see it, do you?
I mean, that girl wears a lot of faces.
I don't get the Emma you get.
what Emma is that, Paul?
we were just talking-- - Don't cover for him.
if he has something to say...
forget it.
guys. We got him. There's a business owner downtown with a security camera in an alley two blocks away.
can you get a license plate?
way ahead. Car's registered to...Rick Kester. He's 29.
120 Churchill.
clear.
clear.
please don't hurt me. - We're not gonna hurt you.
who are you? - Maggie Kester. I live here.
you know Rick Kester? - Yes, I do. He's my husband.
dederal detention center. richmond, virginia
thank you for agreeing to come down and talk to us.
are you kidding? I don't want to stay in that house alone.
when was the last time you heard from your husband?
last night.
he... called. I didn't pick up.
we're separated.
6 months now.
7: 15. He didn't leave a message.
why were you hiding from us?
I didn't know it was you. I was scared.
he still has a key, and he's been bothering me, calling me, showing up at work.
Rick can be...scary when he wants to be.
we pulled your records, and your story checks out, but I'm curious about this police report that you filled out a couple of years back in the Emergency Room.
why did your husband try to kill you?
I asked him for a divorce.
so he took a knife to you?
they never pressed charges.
I wouldn't testify because he was sorry. He was.
he wasn't...always like this.
when did you notice a change?
he lost his job and had all this free time and started hanging out with these new friends.
did you ever meet any of them? - No.
I didn't want anything to do with them.
he would come home with these weird ideas - and saying crazy things. - What things?
he started talking a lot about death, how life didn't matter.
he got really dark. He was depressed.
we're gonna give you protection till we find your husband.
excuse me.
so you believe her? - Yeah, I do.
she's tragic and pathetic, and I know her well.
how so?
she wants the man in her head, not the one she married.
she's my mother, my sister, my other sister.
no one ever wants to see what's really there.
we need to find the husband. He's the closest thing we have to finding Joey.
why don't you let me see Joe again, see if I can get him to talk?
let me try.
I think it's time Joe and I met anyway.
what do you want, Paul?
you need any help? - No.
I'm sorry about before and whatever I've done.
we're all in this together, and I don't want things to be like this.
I don't either, Paul.
can we sort of pretend that we like each other and,
I don't know, see where that goes?
truce?
you bitch! - Don't try to turn Jacob against me.
it won't work.
bitch!
I'm Agent Parker.
we haven't officially met. How's your hand?
first of all, awesome job.
I'm very impressed.
how much planning did all of this take?
seriously, you are doing a great job.
thank you for my book.
you're welcome.
why torch your critics? That seems a little petty.
dear.
has someone been playing with matches?
I like fire, sir.
it started when I was a kid, and it just stuck.
I'm not good at knives.
I've been practicing getting better, but I still prefer fire.
definitely makes a statement.
tell me more.
Poe often wrote of revenge.
I want my chapter to be about revenge.
I want to target the people who hurt you professionally.
I've done my research. I know who they are.
I'm not above revenge, Agent. I think I've proved that.
revenge is primal. It's a universal theme, and every good story needs one.
don't you agree, Ryan?
of course, his theme...somewhat different.
so your acolytes come up with ways to make you proud with these little tributes.
is that the way they're helping you write your book?
right. Everyone has a story to tell, Agent.
your little devotee, is he gonna torch all your critics?
there are really only 3 people that I hold accountable for my professional downfall, Agent.
isn't that right, Ryan?
I wonder who he holds accountable...for his downfall.
must be very hard for you to be surrounded by the stench of death again.
I know this takes a terrible toll on you, and you must be careful, what with that...
little heart of yours.
what are you doing?
3 people responsible for Joe's downfall-- his words.
that would be me, the dead critic, and this guy.
he was a professor at the university.
I interviewed him. He was a dean.
after Joe's book failed, this guy denied him tenure, said that Joe wasn't worthy. It was a big blow to Joe's career.
here it is. Phillip Barnes, Dean of Literature.
do you think he's still the dean?
as far as I know. This was years ago.
Winslow university richmond, virginia
may I help you?
did we have an appointment?
why did you deny Joe Carroll tenure?
I beg your pardon. - I asked you a question.
is this a joke?
I'm sorry. You need to leave.
no. You need to sit.
why did you deny Carroll tenure? Answer me.
I never killed anyone with a knife before.
press is using the cult word. It's out there.
we gonna comment?
no. Let them speculate. Where's Ryan?
he went outside.
there's no way you could have stopped this.
Yeah. I could have.
see, that's the point. He's baiting me!
I should have seen it coming.
Why? Because you interviewed him 8 years ago? Seriously?
you know Carroll's out to torture you.
well, it's working.
professor Carroll.
Ryan Hardy, FBI. - yes, yes.
my wife said to expect you.
it's a pleasure, Agent Hardy. How can I help?
I was hoping to pick your brain on a case I'm working on.
the murders. Yes. Oh, gosh. Awful. Poor girls.
no. I'd relish the opportunity.
Relish."I don't mean relish. I mean, it's not every day one gets to aid the FBI in a murder investigation, is it?
now a good time? - No. I'm afraid not.
I'm already late for an appointment, but, look.
just call my office. I'm free every night this week.
I'll do that. Thank you, sir.
please call me Joe. Nice to meet you.
all right. Get in closer. Smile!
how was it? - I don't like it. One more.
can I call mom now?
no, you cannot, and stop asking me that!
no. We can't pretend to be gay.
Sarah Fuller has major issues.
she's not gonna warm up to a straight guy the way that she would to a totally nonthreatening gay couple.
I don't know.
Joe thinks it's a great idea.
but we're straight.
details. Come on.
expand your minds.
let's try.
kiss. - What, now?
let's see if you can pull it off.
no, no, no. No way, no way.
you guys are losers!
so what am I gonna tell Joe?
okay. Okay. Let's do this.
come on.
gay chicken.
what's wrong with him?
what do you think you're doing? - Get away.
come on, man. Don't do this.
where are you going, huh?
your face is all over the news right now. Don't be stupid.
you're a liar.
authorities have yet to confirm or deny any cult activity surrounding Joe Carroll.
so does the coffee work as an equalizer?
that's the idea. Rick Kester's records just came in.
take a look at this.
wait.
a critic for the "Richmond Herald" Stan Fellows is dead.
the assailant, a street performer, is currently at large...
come in?
excuse me.
I'm watching the news. What's happening?
listen. We have a suspect. I need to ask you something.
the man who's starting the fires? - Right.
I've just got his credit card statements, and there's a couple of items that I just need to confirm with you
all Pro sponge ball, Ridley Race car set, dragon ninja warrior
action figure. Yeah.
those are all Joey's favorite toys. What's going on?
this is good news, Claire.
they bought him toys.
wherever he is, they're not hurting him.
I want him home, Ryan. He's not gonna be safe until he's home.
I know.
I got to go. I'll call you later, okay?
Bye-bye. - Bye.
I've been here all day. Can I go now? - Soon.
any idea why your husband would purchase toys?
I don't know. It's his credit card. You'll have to ask him.
it's Rick.
answer it. Put it on speaker phone.
Rick. - Where are you?
the FBI came to the house, Rick.
what have you done?
are you with them now?
Y-yes. Yes. They're looking for you, Rick. You're in trouble.
how could you hurt those people?
where are you, Rick?
is Ryan Hardy there?
tell Ryan it was all for him.
he's using the same setup at their internet.
it's being routed internationally. We can't trace it.
what do you think?
we try and make contact?
I don't know.
take her home, stay with her.
I'll send someone to relieve you in the morning.
I'll go with him. - No.
what you're gonna do, vodka breath, is go back to that dumpy, little motel the FBI put us in and get some rest.
I feel totally fine.
when was the last time you had more than an hour of sleep?
you're gonna go, and you're gonna get some sleep, Ryan, and tomorrow, we're gonna find Joey.
do you understand?
look. I get it. You overidentify with the victims, the guilt makes it personal, you unravel.
I get it.
you okay?
not going back to the hotel to sleep, are you?
I think Rick Kester knows where Joey is.
well, they gave me a rental car.
Joey's in his room.
he thinks we got into a little fight.
paul just needed to blow off some steam.
our faces are all over the news.
what if he goes into town? - I know Paul, okay?
he's not gonna go into town.
did you send that e-mail? - Not yet.
I was waiting for Rick to call.
why is no one doing what they're supposed to do?
damn it.
excuse me. Megan?
where would I find the wine?
we don't sell wine.
all we have is beer. That's the law.
well, I really wanted wine.
so, red or white?
g-go with the red.
and, what time do you get off?
do you really think he's gonna come here?
we just want to keep you safe, that's all.
do what you normally do.
pretend I'm not even here.
help yourself to the fridge.
yo. - Okay. Hardy and I are outside.
what? Does Parker know?
Yeah.
do you really think Kester would be stupid enough to come here?
he's already killed two people today.
he's escalating, he's getting bolder.
we'll be outside if you need us. - Yeah.
does Parker know we're here?
she told me to watch you.
look. I know you march to your own drum and everything, and, that's cool. Maybe someday I can, but I'm the second youngest agent in the BAU, and people still look at me funny.
this is my career, sir.
you still live in Brooklyn? - Yeah.
you ever make it up to Albany?
I read your book. I know you grew up there.
not for years. No reason.
right.
family. Sorry.
I'm a military brat.
was born in San Diego. I've lived everywhere
I'm gonna take a look around, stretch my legs.
Ryan, good to see you. Come on in.
I'm afraid it's only me tonight.
Claire's out with the little one. Can I get you a drink?
no. I'm fine. Thanks.
my God.
this is a moment when it all becomes very real.
your wife mentioned Edgar Allan Poe as a reference for the eyes.
Yes. What makes you think that your killer has a greater literary purpose?
well, there's a sophistication to the murders, the way the bodies are handled and displayed.
there's a...romance to it.
Poe's eye allegories would certainly fit, and you'll find his symbolism full of haunting romance. Here.
great. Thanks a lot.
I'll get this right back to you. - No, no, no. Don't you dare.
no. This has-- this has been a treat for me.
now please may I offer you a drink?
all right. Sure. Yeah. Whatever you're drinking.
I need a breather.
and more wine.
sure.
we're not having sex, okay?
let's just take that off the table. - Okay.
wait. No. That hurt.
were you just choking me?
no. No. Of course not.
we should get going. It's getting late.
but-- - I need to get home. Okay?
okay.
okay.
wait. Let me get the door for you.
don't be so happy to see me.
will you excuse us, please?
I'm not talking to you.
well, you're gonna have to.
I need some information from you, Jordy.
believe it or not, I'm walking on air - I was talking to Joe. - I never
and he wants to see you.
I want to see him.
I can make that happen, but I can't if you won't talk to me.
you okay in here? - Yeah, I guess.
are you married, Agent Riley? - Divorced.
was she a good woman?
she wasn't the problem.
what was that?
was that inside or outside?
Yeah. - You okay?
I'm not sure.
there's someone in the backyard.
I'm coming in.
how do I know you're not lying?
what if I tell you stuff and you don't let me see Joe?
character, Jordy.
I say what I mean, and I mean what I say.
what if I tell you stuff and you don't like the stuff I tell you?
do I still get to see Joe?
just talk to me, Jordy. I'll let you see Joe.
I don't know where the kid is. - come on, Jordy.
I don't. We divide the secrets so no one person knows everything in case one of us gets caught.
so who has Joey? - Emma and Jacob and Paul, but I don't know where they are, and that's the truth.
can I see Joe now? - Does Rick know where Joey is?
I don't know, but his wife does.
what? - Maggie.
she and Emma planned that part.
something's up.
hello.
you lied! - It's Parker.
Jordy just told me Maggie Kester is one of them. She's lying.
Maggie's one of them.
Maggie, you're getting a message.
what does it say? - It says,"now.
what the?
Oh, my God. Baby, are you okay? - You went too deep.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
you lose. You suck at games. - He sucks at knives.
all right. Who's next? Truth or dare?
guys, she needs a hospital. - What?
Oh, my God. Baby, I'm so sorry. Baby, I'm so sorry.
there's no time. We have to go.
Oh, my God.
get an ambulance!
here. Hold pressure on this. - Okay. Okay. Hold on. i got it. Okay.
Troy. Look at me. You're gonna be okay.
stop!
stop!
no. Please, please. He's gonna kill me.
I don't think so, Maggie.
No!
what is that?
what the hell?
guys. This is Megan.
Megan, this is Emma and Jacob.
who is she? - She's a friend, and she's gonna be staying with us for a while.
you have lost your mind.
I'm done listening to her.
I'll take care of this. Go check on Joey.
go.
what are you doing, Paul?
I'm tired of being the third wheel, and now I'm not.
I know you're mad at me right now, but you can't ruin things for everyone.
does Emma know what a liar you are?
we promised we wouldn't tell anyone...
especially Emma.
I drank too much. Sarah's gonna think I'm a drunk.
are you kidding? She loves you.
you had a few too many, too.
you know that? So touchy-feely when you drink.
it's for Sarah, all right?
I mean, we go to look like a real couple.
so touchy... - Stop that.
look.
we can't keep her here.
look. I'll help you take her into the basement, okay?
that woman fooled me today, and I am...
mad.
Riley didn't have to die.
thanks a lot. I'll read it right way, I promise.
well, feel free to hate it. Everyone else has.
it's not doing well?
I think that's the third copy.
maybe I should give you 20 bucks or something.
listen. I really appreciate tonight, Joe.
well, if nothing else it's good scotch, huh?
it's great scotch.
you know, I've been working on this case nonstop for months now.
sometimes I just forget to stop and turn it off for a few hours.
I couldn't turn it off if I were you.
must be hard with friends and family when you're running around,
I imagine it, it gets quite lonely.
but the payoff, huh?
helping people, saving lives.
you know, I think what you do is quite remarkable.
one more, huh?
sure. Why not?
Joe fooled me.
I should have known from the first time I met him he was the man I was looking for, but he had this power.
I'm sorry, Joe.
I'm sorry, Joe!
charmed and seduced.
I know what his followers feel.
they're better for being near him.
he knows how to give them a little piece of...
what they're missing.
I'm sorry, Joe.
I fell for it.
and 5 more girls were murdered.
I got your message. What is it?
I got an e-mail.
see? If you catch the sun just right, the bug catches fire.
why do you want to kill a bug?
because we can.
see, if you kill the bug, then it dies, and your life means a little more.
I-- I don't understand. - Look at this little guy.
where did you get a cute, little mouse?
caught him in a trap. Here. Screw the lid on.
it's got to be real tight.
then it's gonna suffocate. It-- it will die.
exactly. Here. Screw the lid on.
I don't want to. - It's okay, sweetie. Go ahead.
then we watch it go straight to heaven.
there you go.
I never killed anything before.
we're just getting started.
they're teaching him.
Claire, we are going to find him.
then do it! - Claire! Claire, wait.
Joey, can you wave to the camera and say,"Hi. Ryan"?
who's that? - He's a friend.
come on. Just say it for me.
Hi, Ryan!
you made me give up the FBI.
please, Jana.
I'm here for you when you need anything.
you've been so good to me.
who are you, Lily Gray?
I'm a woman who has been waiting for this moment for a very long time.
and how is Ryan?
I'm interested in one thing.
I want to kill Joe Carroll.
something tells me that home, sweet, home is very close by.
I want to spend some time with Joe without interruption.
why are you being so nice to me?
I like you, Emma.
you left me all alone.
Where's Giselle?
Where's Joe Carroll?
where is Max?
dead! I killed her.
No!
did you lock us in here?
mother doesn't want to be disturbed.
I'm sorry.
where have you been?
I will not be controlled.
I don't want to control you.
I wouldn't want you if I could.
no. You're way better in bed.
I mean, you're a way better cuddle buddy than Laura.
no. I know, I know.
Yeah.
what's up?
When'd you get home?
uh, a little while ago.
what-- what's going on?
someone-- someone in there with you?
uh, yeah. It's, um-- it's Giselle.
Oh. Giselle's back. Awesome!
Hey. Look, Mark. We're, uh, kind of in the middle of something, you know?
no. I don't know. Let me in.
OK, ok.
we didn't want you to find out this way, but, you know, there's always been that unspoken thing between Giselle and I?
well, we've been exploring it.
what are you talking about?
what?
what-- what happened? Gis...
she-- she's dead.
no, no. She's just-- she's just sleeping is all.
Luke, what did you do to her?
I didn't do anything. She's just
Hey, Giselle. Wake up, wake up.
Hey. Come on. Wake up!
Hey. Wake up. Come on.
Hey. Wake up.
Luke, Luke, she's dead!
don't say that!
she's...
she's not dead.
who did this?
Ryan Hardy killed her.
let me get this straight...
for this to be a photograph of who you say it is, someone would have had to swapped all of the DNA records in Sentinel, both digital and hard copies, know the exact warehouse where the physical DNA was stored, and replace it.
let me finish.
and replace it with Carroll's illegitimate brother's DNA.
look. The sheriff in Havenport last year Tim Nelson, AKA Roderick, was Joe Carroll's number two guy.
he infiltrated law enforcement for years.
that was a sheriff's department.
we're the FBI.
there are no killer cult moles in the FBI.
there were several key moments unaccounted for last year where Carroll's cult was ahead of us.
and it had to have been a mole?
it had nothing to do with incompetence?
I'm sorry.
listen. You're a consultant here, and if this case is getting to be too much for you...
no. I'm fine.
are you sure?
I was briefed. I know last year left some scars, your psych eval's still pending.
all I'm saying is that you're free to go home.
everyone here would understand.
authorities are continuing to search for former Soho gallery owner Lily Gray, who's now under suspicion of being involved...
Hey. Relax. It's me.
you ok?
you've been gone a long time.
I had to drive a ways to find 24-hour pharmacy.
OK. All right. We have bandages, we have peroxide, needle and thread.
did you bring any vodka?
very funny.
law enforcement officials continue to ask...
Giselle knew we were here.
if she told someone, they're gonna come for us.
gave the manager 50 bucks to give us a heads-up if he saw anyone.
I'm gonna stitch you up, we get out of here.
I broke into that woman's home.
I tried to remove the evidence, but I had to make a run for it.
local police could be processing it now.
I left blood, I left clothes, I left prints.
it's gonna take time for them to tie it to New York unless you want to call the FBI and help it along, hmm?
I thought you were dead.
I know, but I wasn't.
OK, ok, ok.
Hey. How about you take the car and head back to New York?
no way.
look at you. You could be dead.
you still think you can do this alone.
I don't get it.
it's Weston.
it's me.
Ryan, are you all right? Where are you?
I'm in Stratford, Connecticut.
I found Lily and the twins.
you called me?
Yeah. Surprise.
I need your help, Mike.
I don't want to screw this up.
are you ok? Did-- did something happen?
Yeah, but there's no time.
I'm in a motel. I'm at Oak and 6th, room 7.
call everyone in, ATF, SWAT, police.
Lily Gray doesn't just have twins.
she's got a whole family.
I don't know how many.
yeah?
is Joe Carroll with them?
I'm pretty sure he is.
I'm on my way.
I could stay like this forever.
I wouldn't object to that.
but there's so much to do.
you know we can't stay here.
sooner or later, they're gonna find this place.
do you want a drink?
Yeah, please.
but I take it you have somewhere in mind, huh?
of course I have a plan, Joe.
I knew once I was exposed to the world everything would change, so I've made provisions.
I have a plane.
it's at an airstrip near here.
we could fly to Boston tonight and take a private jet to Venezuela.
I own an estate there.
it's on the coast.
it's lovely.
Yeah. That sounds, uh...
that sounds very nice, but, um...
why Venezuela?
well, there's no extradition, for one.
that adds a certain safety.
we could get new identities.
you'd write, and I'd paint.
you'd publish under a pseudonym.
it would be just you and me and the kids, and Emma and Mandy would join us, too.
we'd be a family.
that's a great deal to consider.
what's to consider?
it's perfect.
what other options do you have?
there're always options, Lily.
go away.
What?!
where were you?
what happened to her?
Ryan Hardy killed her, killed Jamel, too.
why didn't you tell me about Ryan?
how could you hide this from me?
he surprised me!
I was-- I was in the moment!
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna kill him, mom!
I'm gonna kill him! He's not gonna get away with it.
he's-- he's not gonna-- he's not gonna get away with it.
he's not gonna get away with it.
he's not gonna-- he's not gonna get away with it!
Luke, stop it!
look at me.
we have to keep ourselves together.
Ryan has to pay for what he did.
he will, but if Ryan's near, we are all in danger, and we have to leave.
he's-- he's with his niece.
no one else. Giselle told me.
they're staying at some motel in Stratford.
I shot him. He's hurt. Let me go finish him off, mom.
shut up!
go tell everyone we have to leave a soon as possible, but don't mention Ryan Hardy to Joe or Emma or that other-- whatever the hell her name is-- Mandy.
you're worried about Joe finding out.
Giselle is dead, mom.
and as far as I understand it, that is entirely your fault.
now is not the time to test me, Luke.
we're leaving in the morning.
how do you feel?
great, doctor. Good as new.
so where's the cavalry?
something's wrong. It should take the FBI 15 minutes to get here by helicopter.
did you drive?
can I come in?
Yeah. Sorry.
Hello, again.
you two know each other?
we met. Briefly.
so where is everybody? We need manpower.
there isn't anybody else. It's just me.
what do you mean it's just you?
we need roadblocks, aerial searches.
I think the FBI might be compromised.
have you seen Joe? Is he up yet.
in English, please.
Emma.
have you seen Joe?
he's in Lily's room, where he's been all night.
they had sex.
what?
it was pretty intense.
the doors around here are thick, and I still heard it.
what's wrong?
nothing.
Really? Because you look like just sucked a lemon.
why is everyone packing?
I don't know. Why don't you ask?
that's Joe.
no. That is Joe. The girl is the daughter of one his prison pen pals.
Ryan, I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
so Joe has someone on the inside.
he had to. He was tipped off at every turn.
you know, Roderick went to the academy in Virginia.
and the militia boys in Havenport, they had several ties to the FBI.
now I want to pursue this, but the minute I open an investigation they're gonna know.
no. You don't want to tip them off. You're right not to.
you said Lily and the twins were here.
they're somewhere in Stratford.
Yeah, but we don't have an exact location.
we're pretty sure they know we're here, and I think they're pissed because I killed two of their family.
they'll show up.
that's your plan?
pretty much.
we need a better plan.
look. We're sitting ducks here.
we need to be smart about this.
come on. Let's go.
Oh, now you're the gentleman?
sorry about the other day.
save it.
excuse me, sir.
Hey, punk.
there you are.
look. I'm sorry, but we, uh, we need to talk.
it's quite urgent.
Lily's leaving.
I noticed.
Yeah. She wants us to go with her to Venezuela.
you're kidding.
she's got it all worked out.
she's got a big house on the ocean, she's offering us money and protection, and Venezuela's got very strong extradition laws.
sounds awesome.
Yeah. Yeah. Guess it does.
and she wants, uh-- She thinks I should write a new novel.
have you read it?
what, this? Yeah.
it's fabricated myth, half facts.
it's, uh, it's wretched.
in other words, the truth.
Yeah. Yeah. I suppose it is.
still horribly written, though.
and yet...
it's still better than anything I could write.
I'm no writer. I...
never was.
no. It's high time that I-- I stop pretending that I'm something I'm not, and I can't go to Venezuela.
I'll only disappoint a new group of people.
so what are you going to do?
well, I suspect I don't have much time left on this Earth, but whatever time I do have,
I know I want it to be better than this.
so you have a plan?
Yeah.
Yes, I do. I have an epic plan.
will it work? I don't know. Heh.
I can't promise you anything...
but I can promise you my loyalty.
I'll never take you for granted again.
I need you, em.
please will you come with me?
I'm tired of running, Joe.
I told the manager we were taking him back to New York.
he'd prefer we keep his fine establishment out of it.
that's his car over there.
looks like he came alone.
can you run his plates?
Yeah. - They're fakes.
you won't find anything.
Wow.
your lips are perfect, you know that?
I found this on him.
so...
any chance you're gonna tell us where that crazy mother of yours is?
she's with Joe.
now doesn't that make you squirm knowing you're so close but not?
you know what makes me squirm?
the thought of killing you and then doing things to you.
one more, please.
you got it.
Really?
Hey. You ok?
Yeah, I'm fine.
you sure you're up for this?
we got to keep our heads straight.
coming from you, Ryan, that carries a lot of weight.
really. - No. All I'm saying is...
Hey. I got it.
I'm good.
Hi, sweetie. Are you all done packing?
I don't have much.
Oh. You excited to go to Venezuela?
I don't even know where that is.
you're gonna love it.
my house there is much nicer than this one, and it's on the ocean, and you'll have lots of things to do.
I've never been on an airplane before.
well, you're in for a treat.
I hope. We really have to hurry.
are you sure Joe wants to go?
have you heard something else?
not really.
I'd really like to come with you.
I like being here with your family.
sweetheart...
this is your family, too, now.
maybe you should talk to Joe.
um, just...
excuse me. Heh.
Luke got held up by me.
Where's my son?
he's in my backseat bleeding.
Ryan, where are you?
close enough that I could have the FBI on you in a matter of minutes, but I think you know all I really want is Joe Carroll.
if anything happens to my son, there will be no end to your suffering.
don't be so melodramatic.
I want to make a trade,
your son for Joe Carroll.
so listen close.
there's a dam off Route 22.
the road's closed. I'll be waiting.
you cross me, and I will kill Luke just I killed your other two sick psycho kids.
I'll be there.
all packed?
Yeah. Ready.
any problems?
no problems.
I brought you lunch.
Oh. Hmm. Lovely.
OK. The truth.
everything's not all right.
what's wrong?
Ryan Hardy's in town.
and you know this how?
because he followed Giselle to a nearby town and he killed her.
he killed her?
Yes. He stabbed her in the chest.
she was very dear to me.
so Ryan Hardy is nearby.
Yes, and he's taken Luke captive.
he's offered a deal, a trade really.
you for my son.
let me know where he is, and I'll-- I'll take care of him.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
I've sacrificed too much, Joe.
I'm not willing to give up on you.
whoa. Did you, um...
did you just...
Oh, you-- you-- you-- ohh-- ohh!
it's all right, it's all right.
I understand you might be a little upset about this.
you're clear on what needs to be done?
Yes.
we'll see you at the airstrip once I have Luke.
if Emma and Mandy give you problems, kill them.
you at the dam?
where are you?
I'm almost there.
hurry.
have you seen Joe?
no. Did he leave with Lily and Mark?
mark and Lily left?
we're supposed to go with Sami and Radmila to the airport.
wait. No. Airstrip.
it's a small plane that's gonna take us to the jet!
how do you know this?
I ask questions, Emma.
look. I think something is wrong.
help me find Joe.
OK. You're so uptight.
what's wrong with him?
I think he's drugged.
Joe, come on. Come on. Wake up! Joe!
OK. Time to see mommy.
that's not Joe Carroll!
and you're not Ryan Hardy!
where is he?
drop your gun, little girl.
not till he drops his.
Where's Joe Carroll?
I realized I was at a disadvantage.
Luke's well-being is important to me, whereas you couldn't care less whether Joe Carroll lives or dies, so I needed leverage.
the kind gentleman here was, uh, sweet enough to give us a ride.
I know how you law people revere the innocent, so tell Ryan to get out from wherever he is hiding.
Ryan's not here.
Luke shot him, remember?
he can't even walk.
I know you didn't come here on your own.
I'm right here!
don't hurt him.
drop your gun.
mark, lose your gun.
throw your gun over the railing!
now!
Oops. I guess I throw like a girl.
give me my brother!
Hey. Come and get him. I dare you.
Yeah. That's it. Go ahead. Grab it.
bet Max has got better reflexes than you.
come on! This game of chicken is getting old.
someone's got to make a move.
I'll make a move.
the choice is simple.
this man's life for my son's freedom.
No!
Aah!
try that again, bitch!
give me my son.
now!
let him go!
let him go!
must be awful being the good guys.
so many rules.
I need an ambulance at the Dover dam.
stab wound to the back.
go, Mike, go!
Mandy, grab me that perfume.
OK.
OK. Come on, Joe.
come on.
Oh. All right.
it's ok. I think Lily drugged you.
Yeah. Yeah. Ok.
OK. We got to-- we got to go.
come on. Come on.
where you go?
uh, there's been a change of plan.
all right. Turning around.
Russian's got a gun.
you stay here until Lily calls.
you're not gonna shoot me.
I'm Lily's pet.
get your stuff. Come on.
we got to go.
you really scared me.
Oh. Trust, mouse.
trust!
any words from Mike Weston?
none, but we just got word of a B&E in a home in Stratford, Connecticut.
woman was held hostage.
turned into a shootout between two men.
Stratford? That's on the New Haven line.
stratford police pulled prints at the house.
we got a match on one of the twins and the female Hardy was tailing.
alert the local police.
I want intel on every bus and train station, airfield, and interstate out of Stratford.
call Phillips, fill him in, get me a chopper.
on it.
help!
Where's Joe Carroll?
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.
where are they going?
where are they going?
listen to me. Joe turned on you.
he betrayed Lily.
where is he?
airfield. Tillman Road.
hit redial.
mark, where are you?
we're at the bridge.
it all went to hell, Emma. We got Luke, but the FBI, they're after us.
Ryan came to the house.
he killed Sami and Radmila.
I have Joe. Where is the airstrip?
it's on Tillman Road.
we'll-- we'll meet you there in 20 minutes.
just wait for us.
the pilot will be ready.
I think we can beat.
we need to get to that plane before they do.
we have to go! We have to go!
Where's Luke?
Where's Luke?!
No! No, no!
No! Come back!
I got to get Luke.
no. It's too late. Drive.
drive. Drive!
Mike, stop!
Mike, stop it!
are you the pickup?
Yeah. We got to leave right away.
I thought there'd be more of you.
none. They're not coming.
watch your step.
yeah?
what?
where is he? - I don't know.
where is he?
I don't know!
where did he go?
the man got a call. He told the girls to get off.
I was going home. I haven't been paid.
OK. This man. Did you recognize him?
no.
it was Joe Carroll.
Joe Carroll? The killer guy?
he's dead, isn't he?
all right, guys. Let's hold him for questioning, please.
Hey, hey. Listen. I saw Joe.
he's got to be close. You need to set up roadblocks now!
if Joe Carroll is alive,
I will deal with it, not you!
I guess destroying your own career wasn't enough.
congratulations, Ryan. They are both done.
Hey.
you ok? I'm sorry.
I'm good. You?
Yes. I'm just not so sure about your friend Weston.
it's not my blood. It's Luke's.
he nearly killed him. They transported him to a secure hospital in New York.
he might not survive.
what's going on with you?
Joe was here.
you saw him?
I nearly had him. He got away.
he could be anywhere now.
somebody tipped him off. You're right, Mike.
somebody inside the FBI is helping him.
we can't trust anybody now.
no. Thank you, Jana.
you saved us. I'm in debt to you, and I'll be in touch.
Heh. Yes. Good-bye, sweetheart.
who's Jana?
she's Joe's friend.
her daughter gave me this ring.
Jana is an old friend with many useful resources.
she FBI?
no. She's more of a stay-at-home mom these days, but she still consults occasionally.
she said to head west on the back roads.
the local police have started blocking the major interstate.
no need to worry. We have plenty of time.
it's Lily.
well, put her on speaker.
Hello, Lily.
you got away?
the FBI's all over the airstrip.
we couldn't get close.
no. We're fine.
they killed Luke.
they killed my son.
Yeah. I know that means something to you, Lily, but frankly, I was never fond of the boy.
what?
Yeah. You drugged me.
you tried to control me.
as far as I'm concerned, you are getting exactly what you deserved.
you ungrateful bastard.
I gave up everything for you.
I lost my son.
Ah. I'm done with you, Lily, you and your international house of psychos.
you don't mean that.
Oh, yes. Yes, I do, and I also mean this.
good-bye.
you know, she's a bit of a drama queen.
you all right, mother?
you-- look. Let me-- let me...
in the united states, the remains of 40, 000people have not been identified.
when police investgations reach a dead end. Groups of civilian volunteers across the country work to name.
when police investgations reach a dead end. Groups of civilian volunteers across the country work to name the forgotten.
what gives your life meaning.
gives you a reason to get out of bed in the morning.
a sense of purpose?
I thought I knew.
I thought I had a purpose.
and when I lost it, I lost myself and then died, trying to get it back.
John doe was left for dead witha broken neck two months ago.
cops worked it hard, but theyouldn't find his name.
his blood was clean, hnts priweren't in the system, so he wasn't an addictor a criminal, just an ordinary guy who needs our help.
so what do we got to work with?
a bag of burgers. - Burgers?
found near his body, cops couldn't I. D.John, but they did I. D.The food.
it's from a local chain called, uh. - Nate's bar & grille. - Nate's bar & grille.
thn knows his burgers.
the police searched four restaurants in the area, but nobody remembers john doe.
try the one in wicker park?
I mean, it's a little ways from there but, uh, it's easily the best.
if john's anything like me, he might have gone the extra mile.
well, if he did do that, he got in trouble on the way back.
he was attacked, right? - We're not sure.
the autopsy just says the blow to the face broke his neck.
could've been a fightor an accident.
but we do knowthat his neck broke because it was weakened by a prior injury--one of many.
broken bones, scar tissue, concussions.
whoever our doe was, life played rough with him.
could he have been a bouncer?
the ones I know get into a lot of fights.
well, he's certainly got the build for it.
or maybe he was one of those con artists who gets hurt and sues people.
just a theory.
Oh, he might've worked construction. Those guys get pretty banged up.
there is a new apartment building going up in that neighborhood.
maybe our doe worked there.
then there'shis--a copy of a y foundin our doe's pockets.
cops checked it for prints, but since this isn't officially a homicide, that's as far as they got.
who knows what it will unlock, literally?
there's a lock smith.- He's a volunteer for the network.
he's been a little affectionate, but I think he might be able to shed some light.
have fun. --Thank you.
Walter, check outyour burger place.
Tyler, when you're finished with your sketch, why don't you and Candace check out that construction site?
what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna see an old friend who knows something about getting beaten up.
so you think I can help you name our john doe?
not him.- His injuries.
I'm thinking he might've boxed.
Yeah, well, he sure took a beating, all right, but it wasn't in the ring.
look at his face. His face is still pretty.
show me a fighter who never had a busted nose.
look at the breaks. See howthey healed? Smooth knitting.
nothing crooked.
no, whoever he was, he got some high-end care.
expensive care.
big guy like me, but bigger?
dad, can we go home now?
I'm gonna miss "power rangers."
well, it's gonna record, buddy, and we're getting yummies right now.
okay, how about this?
it's a hamburger.
Yeah, it's oneof your hamburgers. I mean, just look.
maybe there's something that can tell you where it's from, or who made it.
it's a hamburger.
dad, we've been here forever.
I know, buddy. Here comes the food.
wait. These pickles.
these picklesare straight cut.
these are crinkle cut.
so? - So, which nate's uses crinkle cut pickles?
if we can figure that out.
finnegan, do any of our storesuse crinkle cut piles?
uh, just the original on racine.
they make 'em, uh, special, like they did in 1908.
the rest of us just order 'em. It's a lot cheaper.
Racine, got it.
come on, buddy. Daddy just gota break in the case.
okay, Candace, see what you can do.
Hey, the, uh, foremanat the construction site thinks our doemight've been a welder who stopped showing up at work about a month ago.
all right.
well, this is where a welder might've had his last meal.
welcome tothe original nate's.
cool.
excuse me.
does, uh, this man look familiar at all to you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a regular.
I was wonding why he hadn't been in.
jeez.
do you know his name?
I don't think he ever said.
did he ever say anything about his work?
we think he might've been a welder.
anything you can remember would help.
a q was tuietype.
you know, drank beer, but never more than a few.
paid in cash.
Tippedy rettwell.
Oh, and, you know, he had this really cool money clip--silver witha gold football on it.
he was a football fan?
Oh, big time. He watched all the games.
even had an argument a few months back.
who'd he get int oan argument with?
loud mouth know-it-all regular.
I'm sorry. bartender's memory.- Faces, not names.
if he comes back in here, would you just call meat this number, please?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
thank you so much. - Sure.
okay, what do we know?
well, I made each one of us a copy of the key we found on our john doe, just in case we see anything it might fit.
how about our disappearing welder?
I got a name from the construction guys.
and a few phone numbers.
the electricianwas actually pretty cute.
anyway, our welder. He's alive and well.
he's working a better job. He's not our doe.
which leaves us looking for info about john doe's fancy football money clip.
any luck, Tyler? - Not yet.
and why are weat my place and not lindsey's?
because my neighbors sleep at night.
trust me, we're not happyabout it, either.
soy nuts don't countas snacks.
Hey, silver with a football.
that's a lot of cashfor a money clip.
it's 'cause it's memorabilia.
uh, it says these clips were given to pro football player sin the '90s as a gift from the league.
our doe likes footballso much, he drops five billson a memento?
or not.
big guy, lot of injuries, hind care. Maybe the clip was his.
maybe our john doe was a pro football player.
thanks to walter's keen insight, we're thinking john doe was a pro football player.
and the crowd goes wild!
Tyler, I need youto make us a new sketch.
what's wrong with the old one? --Exactly that. It's too old.
the people who knew john doe in his pro days might not recognize him now.
can you make him look 25?
I can try.
and after that, I guess we should just start, uh, looking at the pro teams.
I'm meeting with the guy from the Chicago office this afternoon.
Oh, I can get someoneto cover my shift.
should we also be calling doctors, or thopedic surgeons, sports medicine guys?
cause even if his pro football days were over, those injuries were with him for life.
okay, my knee still hurts me from field hockey.
sounds pmising.
although, I'm thrown by the field hockey thing.
all right, people.
let's go find football john. Let's go!
as I look back now, I realize that most people never get to love their job.
but even on my worst day, I couldn't wait to get out there.
I thought.
I can't believe they're paying me for this.
I've been managing this team for ten years.
I don't think he ever played for us.
is there a record of everyone who's ever played in the league?
the players' union has that info, but you'd need a name.
you know, with jusa picture, you'd have to hunt through thousands of photos.
32 teams, 53 players to a team, guys swapping in and out. That's a lot of people.
so you're sayinghe could've played proand no one would remember him?
look, I love my team. Even I don't remember all the guys who come and go.
Playmakers, sure. But, uh, lunch pail players?
they're kind of anonymous. - Lunch pail players?
the rest of the team. - The guys who don't get their jerseys hung on the wall when it's all over.
Yeah, they just play as long as they can, as hard as they can, and hope they have something to show for it when they retire.
sorry. Wish I could help more you think that's true.
that our football john wound up with nothing to show for his career or life?
maybe we just haven'tfound it yet.
Lindsey says they had no luck finding john doe's doctor.
well, maybe he couldn't afford a regular doctor after he retired.
I mean, the pros paid forall the high-end stuff, but no.
what are you suggesting?
come on.
big guy, ex-football player?
lis around here?
you're the third chiropractorI've been to.
you sure you don't know him? Not one of my patients.
you know he played football?
well, he's got this money clip here.
and he's got these injuries, look.
looks likea football player. Probably a lineman.
so you can tell what positionhe played based on his injuries?
Quarteacks get broken arms, concussions, torn A.C.L.S.
for receivers, it's ribs, torn hamstrings.
but my guy hurt his neck.
not once. - Many times.
you don't get weak vertebrae from just one hit.
so if he was a lineman, he'd be getting hit head-onover and over.
I dosuppose you could tell me if he played offense or defense, right?
well, there's scar tissuein the ligaments in the neck, but it's asymmetrical, like one side was takingmore contact than the other.
why would. - Why would a player keep getting hit, but more on one side of his neck than the other?
because that player had his hand on a football and couldn't protect himself.
and the player with his hand on the football?
the center.
he played, that's gotta help narrow it down, right?
some.
the players' union says that over 200 centers were active during the years that john might have played, but they just have names.
they don't keep any pictures on file.
and I'm having better luck finding pictures of pro cheer leaders than pro teams.
why am I not surprised?
seriously, players' names are easy to find, but for the full team photo, you gotta buy a poster.
I've ordered, like, 20 so far.
until we find a picture, we could be staringat our doe's nameand never know it.
um, keep him there. - Free drinks if you have to. I'm on my way.
the bartender from nate's says our loud mouth just showed up.
I'll drive.
why would I know his name?
I don't know anything about him.
you knew him well enough to have an argument with him.
what was that about?
the game.
some knucklehead lineman gets injured. - Career ender. - And I was like,"boo-hoo, dumb-ass."
why don't you go lie in your piles of money?
your guy got all Mr. Sensitive, something about the league not helping players transition after they retire.
other than that, I hardly remember the guy.
well, I'm guessing the cops are gonna need you to remember what you were doing that night.
Saturday the 10th, between 8: 00 P. M. And 1: 00 A. M.Approximately.
I'm here every saturday. - Trivia night.
you don't be? Eve meask the experts.
excuse me. - Come on.
gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.
I just got a quick question.
does this guy play triviaon saturday nights, every saturday?
never misses a night, and he cheats, too, with that phone of his.
now could you move, please? - See?
and I don't cheat, Ralph.
what about this guy?
he was a regular here, used to have drinks in this bar.
he was found dead two months ago.
what if I told youhe used to play pro football?
what does that do for you?
now you guys are supposed to be the experts.
this will be the best trivia question you ever get.
he played sometime in the '90s, no but in Chicago.
he was a lineman. We think he was a center.
now for, uh, 130 bucks.
136 bucks.
for 136 bucks, who can tell me this man's name?
wait. I remember this guy now.
he wore a cincinnati cap sometimes.
maybe he played there. Check the walls.
ye, that's him right here.
Gentlen, we have a winner!
bartender, buy these guys a drink.
Tom bryant just got a name.
I used to think it was the game that I loved.
but it was more than that.
people depende on me. They needed me.
I was a part of a team, and when it was over I didn't know how to live without it.
no hits on tom bryant. - Missing personsor other databases.
but we did find a current address.
I'm working to get C.S.U. Into search, but other crimes scenes are getting priority.
could be a while before we get some answers.
well, keep digging.
all right, so we know tom Bryant's name.
now we just need to get to know him.
well, I couldn't sleep last night, so I googled him.
uh, he's local.
he grew up outside of the city, played his ball at joliet high, spent three years in notre dameand was a sixth round pickfor carolina in the '92 draft.
it gets a little bit fuzzy after that,'cause he got traded a bunch, but he played for at least four different teamsand ended his career in cincy with a neck injury in '99.
uh, all the players' union told me was that he was in the league from '92 to '99.
and that his pension forms don't list a beneficiary.
which might explain why nobody's come forward to claim the body.
did it say he had a family? A wife, kids?
I'll put his name out to the network.
and I'll start calling everyone in the phone book named "Bryant."
I can make some phone calls from work, too.
if my boss walks by, I'll ust, I don't know, say something about insurance.
we should talk to every team he ever played for.
let's start where his career ended.
Walter, pack your bags. We're going to Cincinnati.
wait. Seriously?
Tom wathe real deal, on and off the field.
well, anything you could tell us would help. Did he have any family, any problems?
I really didn't know him too well, but he kept hinose clean.
he didn't get distracted by the money, girls and what not.
Tom came to work.
what about after football? Do you know what he next?
I heard he tried to open a barbecue joint with his best friend. - Another player. - Uh, Wayne Wilmers.
they were both from Chicago.
beyond that, I couldn't say.
I wish we had.
I was there for his last game. - Play offs ten years ago.
Tom was playing center, and their damn line backer drilled him as he was hiking the bal you just knew ayt aw, how he dropped.
Tom had come back from a lot of hits, lo but even after a year of doctors and training, as me has loved the game, he wasn't coming back from this.
so, uh, what are you guys gonna do for tom's memorial?
only the stars get ceremonies.
your coach said that you and Tom were pretty good friends, Mr. Wilmers.
Tom Bryant wasn't my friend.
Really? So I'm guessing the restaurant didn't work out.
I used to own that place. Now itend bar six nights a week.
that sound like a success story to you?
and you blame Tom.
the whole thing was his idea.
he had some money after the pros, just not enough to last.
so nine years ago, we went in 50/50.
so what went wrong? - Everything, man.
we were bleeding money.
when did you guys go under?
about a year ago, Tom tells me he wants to go back to school, do something that matters.
if we had just held out, I know we could have turned it around.
but Tom wanted more out of life, so we sold out for chump change.
were you this angrytwo months ago?
Yeah, I was angry.
you have no idea what it's like to retire in your 30s without a clue what to do.
maybe I do have an idea. Maybe I know you can't just stay angry.
you've got to do something.
look, I hadn't seen Tom in six months, man.
I gotta go.
Walter? - Hey.
I'm at Tom's apartment, and there's not one cop car here.
it's like,"well, we'll getto it when we get to it."
if this was Peyton manning, they would have started that search hours ago.
Walter, don't worry about it. Russell's on it.
Lindsey said he had no family.
his parents are gone, no wife, no kids.
we're all he has, Alex.
Walter, it's an apartment. It's not going anywhere.
just go home. I'll call you when I hear something.
this is Bryant's apartment. How long you need?
uh, I'm not really sure. These things can be tricky.
could cause a grid-wide outage.
I didn't know what or who I was anymore.
days turned to weeks weeks turned into months.
I needed to find something, anything to give me a reason.
watch your back what the hell are you doing?
unacceptable.
I should've let you spend the night in central booking.
we know, and we're very grateful you didn't.
say thanks, Walter. - Thanks.
behavior like this doesn't fly, Alex.
if you want to keep working with the department, you might want to rethink the people you're working with.
listen, Grace.
he went overboard, but he was only trying to help.
he found that note. I think we're looking at a homicide.
I got a suspect for you. - Wayne Wilmers.
the threat's headed to the lab.
and I'll look into wilmers. Thanks.
okay.
no death penalty this time.
Thanks, Alex.
I was just. - What the hell ywereou thinking?
you broke into the victim's apartment. You tampered with evidence.
Alex, I know I messed up, but at least I did something for Tom, okay?
I mean, look, we gave the cops his name, his life story, that threat, and they act like it's just another day at the office.
Todeserves better. - We're not cops, Walter.
Chicago P.D. agreed to this arrangement when I left the force, but they can change the game at any time.
okay, but.- Let's just say the threatyou found is some smoking gun.
now any defense attorneyworth a dimecan fight to have it thrown outbecause of your illegal search.
because of you, Tom's killer could go free.
Yeah, well, should go.
Walter's had enthusiasm issues, but this is over-the-top, even for him.
what do you think got into him?
Tom Bryant. He did light a fire under the department.
not that this looks like a homicide, Tom's an active case again.
and we do know where he worked. He was coaching at a local high school.
I have, uh, first period free. You want to check it out?
the first few days, I didn't know what to say to those kids.
I did my best to inspire them.
but the truth is, they didn't need me halfs much as I needed them.
fans get really crazy during games.
I wish I could tell you who wrote it.
I mean, who'd want to kill Tom?
how long had you know him?
Tom knocked on my doorat the start of the school year, looking foran assistant job.
when I found out he'd played pro, I made him offensive coordinator.
I'd have stepped asideand let him run the whole show, but head coach has to be a teache so Tom wasn't teaching here?
he left college early to go pro.
but once he started working here, he decided to get his teaching certificate.
it sounds like he was pretty happy aside from the angry fan mail.
Yeah, he loved this job.
he pushed the kids to be good players and good people.
what do you mean, he pushed?
Oh, he was just a stickler for "no pass, no play," he made'em all study two hours a night.
and he had a dress codeon game days.
Tom got 53 teenage boys to walk into this school wearing suits and ties.
I'm lucky if I canet my students to cover their boxer shorts.
he knew just what to say to get the most from those kids.
he fired 'em up, and it showed on the field.
so you had a good season?
district champs, pulled off a huge upset over last year's winner.
so, uh, this here was Tom's.
Tom had this key on him when they found him.
I've got the master.
I hope something in there helps saturday the 10th.
the threat was written the night Tom was killed.
at that game, was anybody upset with him? Did he have any arguments?
some kids on the other teammit have wand to fight.
like I said, the fans get crazy, but.
it says here that tombenched your star quarter back, Billy York.
it says they argued.
it's the school paper. They love drama.
Tom was worried that pushing Billy could trigger an injury.
you let Tom nchyour star quarter back at a championship game.
how much were you ahead by, coach?
we were down by a field goal.
but I trusted Tom.
he thought we could pull out the win, and we did.
Billy angry on the bench.
police didn't find any printson the threat you found.
Alex is gonna talk to Billy York.
but lindsey found a parent with a tape of the game.
she's gonna pick it upafter work. - Which is actuallywhere I should be soon 'cause my lunch break endedab out 20 minutes ago.
you sure you don't wantto go home?
no.
Cassie's at work, kids are in school, and I called in sick for the rest of the day.
might as well be useful while I still work here.
nobody's kicking anybody off the team.
I don't know. Alex was pretty pissed.
okay, Walter.
what's the deal?
nothing. I'm fine.
I don't know.
Tom just got me thinking, I guess.
you know he scored a touchdown in the '97 playoffs?
centers don't score, Candace.
Tom Bryant did something amazing with his life, and nobody cares.
so what's that say about mine?
Hello?
Yeah, I'm lookingfor Billy York.
the school said they sent him home.
he's out for a run, and my eggs are burning. Come on in.
you, uh, Billy's father? - Uncle. Ray.
Billy's dad's long gone.
I took the boy in after my sister Alice died.
car accident.
Oh, that's rough. I'm sorry.
me, too. She was something else.
so which university are you with?
excuse me?
Oh, I thought you were another scout.
Alex donovan from the forgotten network. We I. D.The unidentified.
Billy's coach was killed.
Yeah, we just got the news.
they called me at work to take Billy home.
real sad to hear about Tom.
good man.
that's what I heard.
I also heard that Tom and Billy argued when he got pulled from the championship.
must've been a lot of scouts there.
how'd Billy feel about getting benched?
he's a hyper-competitive17 year old, man.
how do you think he felt?
he was mad for five minutes, but there were no hard feelings.
sounds like me at that age.
so why did tom bench him?
knee.
if billy tore his A.C.L. There go the scholarships.
that's the kind of coachtom was.
he didn't see the score.
he just saw the kids.
Oh, that was Russell.
Wayne Wilmers was in skokie the night tom was killed.
Alex, you need to see this.
it's Billy and Tom.
he can't ear what they're saying.
Yeah, you don't need sound to know it's not about Billy's knee.
Tom was worried about Billy's knee, so we pulled him from the game.
Billy looks fine to me.
and you don't look worried. You look pissed.
it was an intense game.
tempers were runnin' high.
seemed like Tom was upset about what he was holding in his hand.
what was that?
honestly, I didn't notice.
it was probably justa play that didn't work.
and where were you after the game, between the hours of 8: 00 and 1: 00 that night?
Oh, please.
buying pizza for the kids. We'd just won district.
Tom went home early, and Billy never showed.
after the game, I was here.
I had to rest my knee.
lying to me is one thing, but lying to a cop.
now why did Tom bench you? The truth!
Billy has been having knee problems.
just answer the questions, please.
why did Tom bench you? What was in his handhand?
Tom Bryant cared about you, Billy.
he loved being you ach. Is this how you want to thank him?
all right, that's enough.
if you want to ask him more, that's fine, but he's gonna need a lawyer.
I got to do what's best for the boy.
I'm sure you understand.
we know what they're saying.
on the tape? How'd you get the sound?
we didn't. I found a woman on the network who's hearing-impaired.
she reads lips.
well, their mouths areonly visible for a few seconds, but we sent her the clipand then she sent us this.
I get to be Tom. okay go.
York, sideline, now.
a la lateral. Found this in your gym bag.
didn't. It wasn't me. It wasn't me.
too late. I'm making the call.
I'm making the call?
is that making a judgment call or making a phone call?
okay, let's say Tom is gonna turn them in for something, but what?
and what the hellis Tom holding in his hand?
stolen plays from another team?
well, why guess when we can just look?
Tom put it in his jacket pocket, so where's that jacket now?
well, he wasn't wearing it the night he was murdered.
and this is why.
the gatorade dunk.
wait.
when I broke into Tom's place. - Which was not good and will not happen again
there was an old load of laundry in the washer.
maybe Tom's jacket's in the wash.
Tom must've taken it out.
we're looking for a white piece of paper that's been soaked in gatorade.
trust me, it might help.
and if you find anything that's locked, we still have this key.
detective Russell?
what you're looking for?
those don't look like plays to me.
it's 'cause it's not football.
it's chemistry.
the o's are for oxygen,"x" is for xenon, and the lines are molecular bonds.
this is a teacher's answer key to a chemistry test.
maybe Tom caught billy cheating.
well, he was big on"no pass, no play."
an academic suspension would've hurt Billy's chance sat a scholarship.
at gives motive to Billy, but your theory only works if these are actual answers to an actual test.
well, you spoke to Billy's teacher. Who did he have for chemistry?
coach Flynn.
that fight wasn't about the game.
it was about your class. Biy was failing.
he needed a "b"on the midterm to pass.
this answer key matches your tust T.J level with me.
did you stbilleal it, or did you give it to him so you wouldn't lose your star player?
I don't have to tell you anything.
then how about you tell me?
if Tom reported you for helping Billy cheat, you'd be out of a job, right?
that's why you lied to us.
did you lie about killing Tom, too?
the other kids say you followed Tom out of the pizza placeand didn't come back for a long time.
no, no, no. God, no.
Yeah, Tom and I had it out in the parking lot, but I didn't kill him.
I told him the truth.
which would be hat, exactly?
sat I sold the answer key to someone.
but it wasn't Bill.
who? One of the players?
the only other guy with a stake in Billy's future, and the only other person who lied about why Billy got benched.
uncle ray.
Billy's teammates say you like to brag about his payday in the pros.
so Billy's a winning ticket you're waiting to cash in?
Hey, I'm just proud of the boy.
we also heard you had billy ona pretty rigid workout schedule.
how'd you feel when Tom had him spending more time at the library than the gym?
look, Tom and I didn't see eye to eye about training, but there was respect between us.
we both wanted what was best for Billy.
would that include paying coach Flynn $1, 000to give you the answer key?
then Tom found out you gave Billy the test and pulled him from the game.
maybe you got pissed.
so I wrote him a note. Doesn't prove anything.
it proves you were angry. - Maybe angry enough to kill him.
please, I'm just a man trying to look out for my family.
Yeah, you're. - All right, all right.
we've heard enough.
sorry for the misunderstanding.
Tom still packed quite a punc huh? How many ribs did he break? -Three, four?
you broke twoon the job, right? How long did that take to heal?
two months. Probably longer, if I'm too shy to go to the hospital.
I'm fine.
just sore from working out.
you have nothing.
I'm done talking and so is my boy.
so why don't you just stop harassing me and drive on home?
be glad to. But guess who's coming with us?
Hey, I came as soon as my shift ended.
I hope that's okay.
any luck?
Oh, he's been in there for 45 minutes with a lawyer and a social worker.
kid hasn't said a .
I know that look.
when my son was three, he got an ear infection.
his face lookedjust like that. - Miserable and terrified.
you people shouldn't be in here.
not that there's anything to see.
ray was right, Alex.
search of his home didn't turn up any evidence, and we still can't place him at the crime scene.
Billy talking.
and so far, nothing works.
you want tomaybe send me in?
Oh, hell, no.
Alex is an ex-cop, and I can't even send him in there.
Walter, why don't you go wait out in the bull pen?
Oh, yeah. Okay, sorry.
thank you.
wait, what?
listen, Walter may not know police procedure, but he does know kids, and he knows Tom Bryant.
Tom wasn't some millionaire jock, he was an unsung hero.- A guy who rolled with the punches life threw at him and still managed to make a difference.
he didn't need to be famous, he just needed to know his life counted for something.
hell, Walter is Tom Bryant. - Minus the chiseled jawline and the pro football career.
Billy would talk with Tom. Walter might be the next best thing.
now I know you can't let him in there with him, but that doesn't mean they can't talk.
if you can, uh, just wright here, I'll be a minute.
what ya in for?
great shoes.
Where'd you get 'em?
birthday.
they got that uh, gel in the sole?
helps, right?
it's, um. it's good for your knees.
I wish I had those when I was playing linebacker.
I was in a little better shape then . high school? - Yeah yeah.
coach green's mean machine.
he was a hard-ass, man.
he used to make usdo those, uh.
what do you call 'em. suicides?
he'd make us run, like, a million of those.
guys would be getting sick, and he's just screaming,"more"!
more!
but he just wanted usto be the best.
I mean, he cared.
he cared.
you ever have a coach like that?
Hey, it's okay.
it's okay, man. Tom was worth crying over.
Tom was a hero.
I know it. You know it.
and I think he deserves some justice, don't you?
but we can't give it to him, Billy.
the only person who can give Tom the justice he deserves.
is you.
when I didn't show up for pizza.
coach Tom came looking for me.
some jobs you do for money.
but the best jobs, you do because you care.
because you need to.
I realized that this was my chance to stop quest a era oportunidad from making the same mistakes that I did.
coach Tom believed in me.
as a player.
and a student.
uncle ray got the test, told me to cheat.
but I wouldn't.
I never even looked at that stupid test.
I swear.
I to pied rotect them, but not ery one was looking out for 'em like I was.
uncle ray was only looking out for himself.
I took a lot of hits in my life.
but there was no getting up from this one.
would you be willing to say all this in court?
what would Tom want you to do, Billy?
you did all this, daddy?
well, my group found his name.
the cops caught the bad guys.
but you helped.
you're like a power ranger.
Hey, Alex.
um, about the other day.
I need this.
you know, I just do.
I know the feeling.
so we're cool?
Walter, if you tried to quit, I would come after you.
now breathe.
Tom give that to you?
Tom said if I passed all my classes, he'd, uh.
give me what's inside.
well, did you pass?
putting together the memorial, I finally tracked down a list of all the teams Tom played for.
for half a season in '95, he was in Baltimore.
with Tom playing center, they went all the way.
I lost the job then told me who I was.
lots of people are going through that these days.
it makes you ask some tough questions.
what am I here for?
where can I go to make a difference?
but trust me, the answer's out there.
you've just gotta keep looking.
I found my answer.
my name is Tom Bryant.
do you know why people hate to admit they're lonely?
it's because when you do, everyone thinks something's wrong with you.
they think,"I have people in my life."
why don't you?
but the strange thing is, you can have people in your life and still be alone.
no one knows that better than I do.
Jane Doe.
she just collapsed?
in a local park.
we're thinking no foul play.
the MES finishing the autopsy, but we got a heads-up on the cause of death
too much insulin in her system.
was she diabetic?
well, they found recurring injection marks in her stomach.
looks like an overdose.
suicide.
her problems got so bad, she couldn't see any other way out.
or an accident.
hard to know why, but maybe she didn't realize she had already taken her shot.
either way, our investigation's limited.
department policy. They won't assign more manpower unless it's declared a homicide.
right. - We need your help giving her a name.
I understand. We'll do what we can to get her home.
she just died in the middle of the park like that, in front of a bunch strangers?
and she was young.
those are always the hardest to take.
probably mid-20s, based on the photo and what she was wearing.
she had a purse with her, but no wallet, no ID.
what kind of woman carries a purse with no wallet?
that's like a telephone repairman not carrying his echo sensitizer.
right.
and when she fell, her purse spilled onto the grass.
if she had a wallet, it's possible somebody at the scene swiped it in all the chaos.
Wow. Swiping a dying wan's wallet.Man, that's cold.
whatever was in her purse is at the princt.
Candace Lindsey, maybe you guys could take a look.
there might be something in there that helps us identify her.
what about the databases?
police ran the prints and the DNA.
no criminal record, no missing persons, but it's only been about 48 hours.
there's no wedding ring.
if she lived on her own, it might take a few days before somebody reports her.
it might, but maybe we can ID. Her a little sooner.
the police found this in our Jane Doe's pocket.
looks like a hotel key.
I don't think it's a hotel.
you're late.
huh. Did you miss me?
most hotels put a name or a logo on their cards.
but if it's blank like that, could be a corporate apartment.
why corporate? - They change'em out.
companies keep apartments in town.
when a client comes in, they print him off a key.
my dad's company does it a lot.
couldn't the cops just hack the strip on the back?
Yeah, but it's just an entry code.
there's no address.
so if you lose it, nobody knows what it's for.
she was pretty well-dressed.
maybe our Jane Doe was in town for business.
if she was, maybe she was staying in the area.
the police already checked two the blocks around the scene.
I think we should expand it to ten.
Tyler Walter, you're with me.
quality time, boys.
nothing. Any luck?
six more blocks to go.
swing and a miss. Wrong building.
but the guy said he recognized the gold card from a building a few blocks up.
it's called the Gold Standard.
thanks so much.
Russell said the police took a look, but they didn't see any contact info.
it still helps.
just want to get to know her a little bit.
I mean, a woman's purse is like a time-space continuum
next week's concert tickets, last year's chewing gum.
Yeah.
it just feels strange going through her stuff.
okay, we got one lip gloss, color...
pink.
and that is not a high-fashion pink.
now this-- this is high-fashion.
it's classic. - Yep.
the clasp is broken.
that's beautiful.
for a woman in her mid-20s, she was obviously making good money.
Hey, here's something.
she didn't have a cell phone, but she had a music player.
I don't see any names or addresses, but there are some friends' photos in there.
we should get those to Alex.
you know what? Maybe we can get their names another way.
thanks f bringing this over. We have permission for this?
all clear from detective Russell. - Great.
okay, here we go.
well, it certainly looks like one of ours.
we had them specially made for the color.
gold is our trademark.
Ah, yes. We coded this key about three weeks ago for apartment 42.
and is this the woman who was staying in that unit?
I remember her face.
she was here.
she ave st h abeen guest of one of our residents.
she looked me in the eye when she said hello.
a lot of our visitors just can't be bothered, but she was nice.
here we are.
that unit's owned by the Wellman corporation.
the only tenant to use it in the last month was a Mr. Roger Turow.
thank you.
Mr. Donovan?
I'm Roger Turow.
I appreciate you meeting me out here. I'm certainly not looking for trouble.
trouble? Why would there be trouble?
well, it's my job to book all the corporate apartments for the firm.
I make them available to out-of-town clients or guests.
and sometimes when I see they're not being used, I use them myself.
use them for what?
for gatherings, parties.
it's nothing shady, I assure you.
it's all perfectly normal.
I host wine tastings or book readings.
I have a number of guests.
was she one of 'em?
uh, no.
well, possibly, but I don't recognize her.
she had a key to the apartment made only three weeks ago.
Really? Well, I have a number of keys printed before each event.
I make them available so people can come and go as they please.
I'd like to have the names of those people.
I'm not sure I have them all.
you see, it's not just my guests.
it's their friends and friends of their friends.
Mr. Turow, I'm not looking have you fired, but this woman is dead.
I need to have the names of every guest who might have one of those keys.
of course. Um, I'll-- I'll write them down for you.
and I appreciate you not mentioning anything to my boss abt this.
we're making progress.
so are we. I just got a call from the MES office. Meet me there.
we called you as soon as we saw it.
well, why didn't you see this before?
because it didn't exist.
it can take up to two days for bruising like this to emerge.
okay, surprise number one.
after autopsy, we noticed a bruise forming in the middle back.
after looking closer, we realized it was an injection site.
she was injected in the back?
definitely, and with a lot of force, like a stabbing motion.
this was a homicide?
you said surprise number one.
is there another one coming?
this is number two
routine dental x-rays of the wisdom teeth.
guys, they aren't developed at all.
what are you saying?
I'm saying your jane doe isn't in her mid-20s.
she couldn't be any older than 15.
15?
I mean, what was she doing at a wine tasting in a corporate apartment?
when I was 15, I did my wine tasting in private.
in the backseat of the quarterback's car?
and where are her parents? They must know she's missing.
I mean, why haven't they reported it?
maybe they don't know.
or maybe they think she's fine.
you'd be surprised at what kids can hide from their parents.
and you'd be surprised at the number of parents who don't really care where their kids are.
well, I'm sure they would have at least expected her to check in, but he may be right.
it's in the fridge. You can heat it up later.
just got back from the Chicago PD.
with the insulin shot in the back, the case is officially a homicide, but the "who is it? " Is still on us.
we need to figure out this girl's story.
maybe she's a runaway.
Yeah, maybe she's one of those kids who got her education from the streets, right?
not from the schools.
it happens.
we can still find Jane Doe's friends.
there were photos on the music player.
Lindsey and I got one of the names from the Midsummer Night's Ball and tracked down an address.
so we'll go talk to her tomorrow.
good, and we'll start calling schools in the morning.
she had to be a student somewhere, rig?
a charity ball for heart disease
is that really something a tenth grader wants in on?
I don't get it.
if we just found out she's 15, she did a pretty good job of hiding it.
so I wonder who else in her life didn't know?
or got angry when they found out.
here she comes.
we're trying to track down a friend of yours.
excuse me? Who are you?
we're from "the forgotten network."
we're volunteers that help identify jane and john does.
that's from the Midsummer Night's Ball.
that's Lisa.
her name is Lisa?
Oh, my god. Did something happen to her?
she was killed a few days ago.
we don't know her that well.
I-I don't even know her last name.
she's Dylan's girlfriend.
who? - Dylan Dreslan. He's an old friend.
he told us about these get-togethers, like mixers, at this building downtown.
the gold standard. - Yeah.
Dylan's a regular.
he's brought Lisa as his date a few times.
Yeah, that's Dylan.
we've known him since high school.
did you know Lisa was still young enough to be in high school?
what?
I really thought Dylan would make things better for me.
most of the boys I knew were still figuring out who they were.
but Dylan...
he me me want to fit inthis world.
you're here about Lisa?
Yso da ago, your girlfriend Lisa was murdered.
U didn't know that?
murdered? - Yeah.
how?
okay, w-wait.
first of all, she wasn't my girlfriend.
careful, Mr.Dreslan.
I promise you, you do not want to lie to me.
no, I'm not lying.
we went out a few times.
I-I took her to a few parties thrown by a friend of mine. That's it.
we need to know Lisa's full name.
when was the last time you saw her?
two days ago, here.
she came to my office, said that she didn't think that we should see each other anymore.
well, did she say why?
no, she just said she wasn't ready to be in a relationship, and I agreed.
I mean, we only met a few weeks ago at a museum exhibit.
do you know where she lives, where her parents might live?
no. We never talked about that.
uh, she said one time that her mother was a hairstylist, I think.
you think?
look, we never talked about that.
it turned out we didn't have a lot in common.
Yeah, well, maybe that's because she was only 15.
I don't know what that means.
it means Lisa Chang was only 15 years old, which at minimum makes you a suspect for statutory rape.
that's not possible.
it is possible.
she was young enough to be in high school.
no, no, no. She teaches high school.
that's what she said. I-I dropped her off a few times.
where? - Uh, Lincoln Rhodes Prep.
the last time you saw her, we need to know where you were for the rest of the day.
I was in meetings with a client all afternoon. You can check.
trust me, we will.
trust me, we will?
too much?
you know, you may not be a cop a, more but you still know how to act like one.
no, her name is Li Wen.
and she wasn't a teacher.
she was a sophomore.
we need to contact her parents.
li lived with her aunt.
we've left her several messages, and if we didn't hear back in the next two days, it's our policy to call the police.
li also has a brother.
he graduated here three years ago.
he's in college now-- Northwestern, I think.
no mother or father?
well, I'm sure they're back in Taiwan.
it's common for our international students to live with a relative or guardiaN.
it's the guardians that register them here at school.
but to be perfectly honest, we don't always know the family situation.
if a student lives with a legal guardian, we don't pry into personal history.
I know you can't get close to every student, but did you know Li?
only a little.
I do think she was having trouble adjusting.
adjusting?
socially.
well, the kids here-- some are from down the block.
some are from all over the world.
it's--it's hard to figure out where you fit in.
school was exciting at first-- a fresh start in a new country, the english textbooks, the new clothes, fr new iends.
my brother Quon loved it here.
d saiI would, too, but he was wrong.
Hey, you ready?
we need to find the aunt.
how come she never reported Li missing?
the address in li's file is 33 Hayworth. Let's go they didn't answer the phone.
when was the last time you saw the tenants?
it's been a while.
thank you.
nothing.
this has to be hers.
and she was all alone.
I was happy when I came here.
but sometimes when you're in a strange place, you never stop feeling like a stranger.
Alex, they found insulin in the refrigerator.
li Wen was living here.
how does this happen?A 15-year-old girl living by herself on Lake Shore Drive?
Where's her guardian?
who pays for this place?
the name on the lease is Mei Chen Li's aunt, but she doesn't pay for the rent.
the landlord says the money gets wired into his account every month.
it'll take a minute, but we're tracking from where.
probably her parents in taiwan.
the school paperwork lists her brother as Quon Wen.
we called his dorm at Northwestern, but he didn't answer, so we're sending a unit.
well, Lindsey knows Northwestern pretty well.
maybe she can help.
Yeah, I'm sure she can.
what?
nothing.
nothing? I thought you liked lindsey.
I think Lindsey's fine.
you know what I think?
I think maybe you're a little jealous.
I mean, Lindsey and I do spend an awful lot of time together. - Oh, my goodness.
and we used to be partners. It's only natural...For you to feel a little threatened. - I am not jealous, and you can spend time with whoever you want.
are we done now?
can we go back to work now?
I'll send Candace and Tyler to Li's school.
maybe some of the students can help us fill in the gaps.
Hey, hold on.
didn't Li's boyfriend Dylan say something about her mother?
he said she was a hairstylist.
the white lotus salon.
maybe it wasn't her mother. Maybe it was her aunt.
how's she doing?
she seems devastated.
when patrol picked her up at the salon, she had no idea Li was gone.
maybe she didn't.
ms. Chen, uh, if you're ready, we would like to ask you a few questions.
you're li's aunt? - Yes.
not by blood, but I take care of her.
when her parents sent her here from taiwan, they hired me.
my god.
when they see she's gone...
I need to call them.
but I still don't know what happened.
forgive me, but I'm trying to see how that's possible.
you're Li's legal guardian.
you had to know she was missing.
no, she was traveling with the school choir.
they were performing at a school in Grand Rapids.
she's coming back on the weekend.
that's what she told you?
of course. I just assumed it was true.
li never lied to me.
ms. Chen, with all due respect, I think you're the one who's lying.
we went to Li's apartment.
the apartment?
she was living there alone-- a 15-year-old girl.
no, that's not right. - It is right. We were there.
please listen.
I don't stay at the apartment, but neither does Li.
she lives with me.
at first, it was my hope to stay with her.
but I have my own family.
they need me closer to them.
so Li understands.
we saw her room.
Yes, that's the apartment her parents arranged for us.
my space isn't big enough for her things.
I think every teenager needs a room of her own.
li goes there during the day to play music and be a teenager.
she was dating a 25-year-old man. Did you know that?
no. I don't believe that.
her school's been leaving messages.
you haven't returned any of those calls.
I didn't know.
they must have been calling the apartment.
li was on her trip.
I never thought to check.
please...
li was like my own daughter.
excuse me. What's going on?
cops are searching one of the rooms.
you know who? - Quon Wen.
someone said he killed his sister.
Where'd you hear that? - Just around.
I bet it's true, thoug 'cause his girlfriend kate's really freaking out.
excuse me!
excuse me, Kate, are you quon's girlfriend?
do I know you? - It's okay.
we're not with the police.
we're with a group called the forgotten network.
I don't know where Quon is.
we really need to talk to him, Kate.
I can't help you.
Kate, you know what happened to his sister Li.
it's not about helping us.
if you want to help him, tell us where we can find him.
so where does your boss think you are right now?
Nsuran Iance Seminar.
you ever been to one?
Yeah, it's like being shot with a tranquilizer dart.
Oh. So you just blew it off?
aren't you worried he'll find out?
well, I mean, the seminar was on avoiding risk, so yeah, maybe I should've gone.
I went to a school like this-- Eastlake Prep.
nothing but a holding pen for out-of-control rich kids
somewhere for their parents to park them until they're old enough to send them away to college.
you know, the whole out-of-control thing I get, but rich? Really?
I mean--I-I just-- I can't picture you in the blazer and tie getup.
I'm not rich. My parents are.
there's a big difference and I burned the blazer and tie the minute I graduated.
li Wen she was a sophomore.
Yeah, I knew her.
didn't talk to her much.
we didn't exactly roll with the same crowd.
and what crowd did Li roll with, exactly?
who's asking?
name's Tyler.
you're not a cop? - No. I'm a volunteer.
I'm just trying to learn about her life.
and you're not worried?
why would I be worried?
I'm just saying, whoever killed that girl, they might not want you asking questions.
honestly, Li didn't talk to too many people, but we were friends.
must have been hard trying to be an american teenager.
I guess, but...
a lot of students at Lincoln Rhodes are from Taiwan, and she could have hung out with them if she wanted to, but they have a whole social thing going on.
what kind of social thing?
I can't really talk about it now.
okay. Then when?
li was a cool girl.
you know,'te didn deserve what happened to her.
you guys ever eat komodo dragon soup?
no.
well, if you get hungry later, around 11: 00, that's the place to get it.
and we can talk then?
what is this?
I think it's what we're having for dinner.
so what about the boyfriend Dylan? His story checked out?
he was with clients the afternoon Li was murdered.
what about the guardian? - Looks good, too.
Russell sent a unit to the apartment.
the aunt said that li was living on a pullout couch.
and what about the choir trip?
never happened. If that's what she told her, she was lying.
I wonder if her parents know something.
we can ask 'em. They're on their way from Taiwan, but when they get here, I'd like to be able to tell them wt happened.
you sure about this?
definitely.
my friends used to do this all the time in high school.
so you're gonna order a soup made from an endangered species?
trust me. There's no soup involved.
I'll have the komodo dragon soup.
you want fries with that?
so what did he give you?
the address of the party.
so what is this?
during the day, it's an abandoned theateR.
I think that proves thwe I nt to the wrong high school.
all right that's Dana Hayes
the girl who tipped us off about this place.
well, maybe now she'll tell us why.
li was a PK.
what is that?
PK. Stands for parachute kid.
we have a lot of them at our school
kids from Taiwan or China who get dropped into the United States.
dropped by who?
their parents.
they want them to have an American education, so they send them here alone and arrange for a guardian.
how do you know all this?
from Li. Her brother Quon did it.
now he's in college.
li's parents sent her over a year ago, but she never liked it here.
why not?
this is why not.
some PKS are pretty much on their own.
seems to me like most kids would want that kind of freedom.
no. Li wasn't like that.
I tried to like them-- the other kids e nt herlike me.
but I just wasn't re y to grow up that fast.
Alex, you seeing this?
if you don't know, somebody knows. No, honestly.
that's Quon-- Li's older brother.
I'm a t gonncalm down! I'm not leaving! - What are you talking about?
Russell thinks Li's brother was involved in the murder.
Yeah, but why would he kill his own sister?
good question. He's four years older.
they don't live together, it doesn't even seem like their lives intersect.
Yeah, but people have all kinds of baggage when it comes to siblings.
that was a general statement. I love my sister.
maybe it wasn't some preplanned thing.
he got angry about something, and it just happened.
well, that fits with the insulin.
it was the only weapon around, so he grabbed it and stabbed her in the back.
I just don't want us assuming anything.
the way we work is by learning about Li, and right now I don't see the connection.
okay, so we stay open to everything.
li was living in two worlds-- her school and hanging with Dylan.
and we know Dylan checked out.
I took a ton of pictures at the rave, and I'll bet that some of those other kids there were PKS.
we should look into that.
sounds like a plan.
I talk with Russell about Quon.
you guys start with these.
if they knew our girl, we need to get to know them.
I'm not saying it's him.
I'm saying most people who run from the cops are criminals.
any luck finding him? - Not yet, but we will.
I mean, think about it-- if quon was innocent, why wouldn't he come in, ask for our help?
I don't know. He might be guilty. It just feels wrong.
what?
you're the one who tells me I should get more in touch with my feelings.
okay, no rush to judgment.
I just got the voice mails from Li's apartment put on disc. Have a seat.
the first two are from the school principal, asking why Li was absent.
then this...
Mei, it's Quon. I can't reach Li. Call me.
it's Quon. Where are you?
is Li okay? Please call me.
you still think he's involved?
Yes, Ms. Chen, my name is Hal Gordon.
I'm with the department of Social Services? here in Chicago.
we received a report regarding child neglect for a young woman named Li Wen.
I've been out to see you twice now, but you weren't home, and you haven't responded to my notes asking you to call.
social Services?
someone filed a complaint for neglect, and a few days later li was murdered?
we need to find the person who filed that complaint.
she's right over there.
just want to ask you a couple more follow-up questions.
you never told us that you reported Li to Social Services?.
don't deny it.
you made an anonymous call, but that call was recorded.
social Services sent us the tape, and I recognized your voice.
I couldn't tell you.
so what happened? Did Li find out that you reported her?
was she upset?
Dana, if you hurt Li in self-defense... - no.
I didn't report Li because I wanted to.
I reported her because she asked me to.
she wanted to go home.
she couldn't do it herself, not after everything her parents gave up to send her here.
she told me they would never understand.
I helped her.
I reported her, and it got her killed.
well, then who killed her?
the PKS.
they don't want investigations.
they don't want anyone going to the authorities about anything.
nobody threatens their freedom.
Dana, you were just at a party with them.
I had to go.
I have to be exactly the same as always around them.
Why?
b-- they must have found out about Li and Social Services?.
I don't want them to know that I was involved.
why didn't you tell us any of this before?
cause I'm scared.
I mean, if they killed Li, what do you expect they're gonna do to me?
I never wanted that kind of freedom
staying out all night, partying.
I tried.
I just never felt like I belonged.
I couldn't tell them I wanted to go home.
they would never have understood.
okay, Wang Feng is a sophomore, Sun Zhizhi, senior, and Chen Shipeng is a freshman.
and there's nine boys in all.
and ten girls.
these are the parachute kids at the rave who went to school with Li.
now Li didn't hang out with the PKS as much, but these are the ones who saw her on a daily basis.
nice job. So 19 kids.
which means 19 suspects, assuming one of them found out about Li and Social Services?.
it's hard to believe. They're just kids.
it's one thing to like your freedom.
it's another thing to kill to protect it.
what, you think we're on the wrong track?
let's find out. We gotta look at this from both sides
social services and these kids.
I know Social Services?.
I've dealt with them once in a while with my own students.
they didn't write up any findings?
they never got a chance. Li was killed two days after the complaint was received.
okay, Lindsey, you take social services, find out what they did on this case.
Walter, you're with Lindsey. Everybody else, we're going back to that school.
uh, what if they won't talk to us?
cause I thought that PKS don't talk to anyone outside their own circle.
li talked with Dana. Somebody will talk with us.
parachute kids-- I-I've heard the term, but all of the kids here at Lincoln Rhodes have registered guardians.
from what we hear, those guardians may not be doing their jobs.
they're doing fine in their classes.
there's no problem with attendance or GPAS.
we found 19 of your students at a rave in an abandoned theater on a school night.
with all due respect, there may be more problems here than you're actually aware of.
nothing. - Dana was right.
these kids won't talk about Li. They won't talk about anything.
they're scared. If they're living without supervision, they know they can be sent back to Taiwan.
I think you should pick 'em up.
which ones? - All of them.
I mean, think about it. These kids could be living alone.
if that's true, it's endangering the welfare of a child.
you have an obligation to investigate.
according to the principal, these kids have guardians.
fine. So let them prove it.
Ifne of these kids killed Li Wen, we need to know which ones have something to hide.
Hey. Okay, so far only three loolegit.
two live with grandparents, one with an uncle who had all the right paperwork.
we're still contacting their other guardians. - Let's keep going.
Alex, this is Hal Gordon from Social Services, a friend.
thanks for your help. You didn't have to come all the way down here.
Hal was assigned to Li's case.
I was out at the house a few times but got no answer, so I took a ride to see Li's brother at Northwestern.
Juan? - Uh,Quon.
Oh, right. Well, he was out, but I did speak to his girlfriend Kate.
so Kate knew that you were investigating Li?
well, I told her. Does that help you?
Yeah, I think it does.
I haven't seen Quon.
I told you, I don't know anything about this.
you're lying, Kate.
you knew Li was being investigated by Social Services?.
you knew she could have been sent home.
did you think quon might have to go with her, that if the police thought Li was being neglected, that Quon could get into some kind of trouble?
maybe even deported?
how much do you love your boyfriend, Kate?
would you kill to keep from losing him?
it wasn't...
I can't hear you.
I wasn't worried about the government.
I was worried about his parents.
I know them.
if Li was being neglected, they would blame Quon.
they would order him to come home, and he would listen.
I just didn't know what to do.
and so I went to see Mei.
li's guardian?
I went to the salon where she works, and I told her that Social Services came to see Quon.
mei was upset.
why didn't you tell us this before?
not tell you what?
that I'm the one that started all of this?
that I'm the one that got Li killed?
I went to Mei, and she told me she would take care of it, and I-I don't know what she did.
did you tell this to Quon?
Kate, does quon know it was Mei?
Mei's apartment's at the end of the hall.
I liked this part much better when I carried a gun.
I kinda like you better without one.
miss Chen?
miss Chen?
either this place was tossed or someone left here in a hurry.
who are you?! What do you want?!
all right, take it easy. - Why are you chasing me? What do you want? - Chicago police! - Drop the gun!
drop the gun! Do it now!
who are you? What do you want? Why are you chasing me? - Drop the gun! Do it now!
last chance! Put it down right now!
nobody's gonna do anything. - Alex, step back, right now!
Quon, just listen. We're not here for you.
we're trying to find Mei Chen.
you're not the police.
I saw you the other night. You chased me.
that's right. My name's Alex Donovan.
I'm not a cop, but this is detective Russell.
there's a badge on her belt.
we're tying to find out what happened to your sister.
my sister was murdered.
that's right. We think we know who did it.
that's who we're trying to find.
we kw it wasn't you.
grace, please. We're fine here. Okay?
Quon, think about your parents, all right?
they've already lost one child.
please don't do this.
please.
come on.
I know you want revenge, Quon, but you have to know this was wrong.
mei killed my sister.
if you knew that, why didn't you go to the police?
why did you run?
you don't understand. My sister and I are PKS.
there are people who take advantage of that.
they kidnap us and ransom us back to our parents.
you thought she was kidnapped?
I thought maybe someone grabbed her, then she tried to escape.
did you call your parents?
no. I couldn't face them.
they'd blame me for not protecting Li, and they'd be right.
mei chen said that li was living with her.
is that true?
no. Li was living alone.
you knew that?
I didn't know in time.
when Li died, I couldn't find Mei.
I started asking around, trying to find out about her.
she lied to me and my parents, and not just about taking care of Li.
about what?
she wasn't just Li's guardian.
she was the guardian for a lot of kids-- PKS all over Chicago.
it was a business for Mei.
if Li had reported her to Social Services, her whole enterprise would have collapsed.
that gives us motive.
now we just have to find her.
I'll call it in. I'll get airports, trains, buses covered.
she has a car.
what kind?
a new Cadillac. I've seen it.
well, if it's new enough, maybe we can stop her.
technology,Miss Chen.
that car of yours has a lot of features.
one is a service that can start and stop your engine from a company computer.
comes in handy when you lose your key, not so handy when you kill someone.
I told you.
I don't know what happened to Li.
I remember what you told us.
you're here because of what you didn't tell us.
you knew Li was being investigated by Social Services.
in other words, you were being investigated for criminal neglect of a child.
I never neglected li.
the fact is, you're no just Li's guardian, are you?
that's why you ran.
once we started questioning PKS, you knew we could find out.
you're listed as guardian for 11 kids in Chicago.
you took their parents' money, and then you abandoned their children.
I guess most of those kid like their freedom, but Li--she wasn't like them, was she?
it was her.
the problem is, I'm not sure we can prove it.
we still can't put her at the scene.
I think I know how.
I need to see the stuff that we found in Li's purse.
it's right here.
all right.
I knew when I saw this before that it was a sophisticated choice for a young woman.
now I know why.
it's not Li's necklace.
it's Mei's.
it was on the ground.
we thought it was one of the things that fell out of li's purse, but it wasn't.
li must have ripped it off your neck right before you killed her.
I warned her.
but she wouldn't listen.
she never listened.
I just wanted to go home.
she came from a small town, like I did.
she said all the right things to my parents, and they believed she would keep us safe.
but I never thought she'd go as far as she did.
for so long, I felt powerless.
but that day, I stood up for myself.
I grew up, even if it was just for that moment.
in the end,
I didn't get to go home after all.
but in a way, home came to me.
my name is Li Wen.
what would you do for the person you love?
sometimes you make compromises for them.
sometimes you carry them.
and sometimes, when they cry for help, you'll do anything.
43? Lindsey, is that out of 100?
sadly, yes.
either your students are failing or you're failing your students.
I'm just saying.
okay, assemble. Recess is over.
we got a white male, mid 40s, found in a Chicago River drainage tunnel two months ago, a few days after death.
well, the current could have brought him there from anywhere.
mm, the water definitely explains the facial bloating.
when Tyler's done with his sketch, I'll look at missing persons.
maybe we'll get lucky and find a match.
did he drown, Alex?
no. It's a gunshot wound to the chest.
the police found a 38 caliber pistol on him, but the serial number was filed off.
they also found a notebook. It's Moleskine, expensive.
but the pages are waterlogged, so not much of the writing is visible.
he was wearing wing tips, khakis and a blue oxford.
how does a guy who dresses like that end up in the Chicago River with a bullet in his chest?
it could have been a robbery.
no. Carrying a black market weapon?
this guy's looking for trouble.
report says that his gun clip was full, so he never even got off a shot.
why would a guy with a gun not even shoot back?
maybe the killer caught him off guard.
no, he was shot in the chest. He saw the killer coming.
you know, I think our guy's an amateur.
when I first started shooting, I think he might have gone to a gun range to practice.
uh, you have a gun?
Northside Arsenal, baby... the only gun range in town.
that's not a bad idea.
I mean, the police investigated the gun.
maybe we should learn more about the guy who was carrying it.
he could have been a regular there, or maybe somebody will remember helping him out.
Seriously? No one else is concerned that he has a gun?
locked and secured at all times.
Walter, why don't you take Candace with you to the gun range?
and you?
I'm on the notebook.
I may know somebody who can help us restore these pages.
Hey. - Hey.
you look good, Greta.
can I help you with something?
uh, river john-- I need the pages of his notebook restored.
what is it?
we're pretty busy here, and I'm on a deadline, so I don't really have time.
this is important. Please.
we have some pen stroke software.
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
ma'am, please use the crosswalk.
ma'am? You brought this on yourself.
jaywalkers.
you know this guy?
uh...Yeah. Yeah, I remember him.
he was here about two months ago, flipped his lid when I wouldn't let him shoot, but, uh, he didn't have an F.O.I.D. Card.
it's a firearm owner's identification card.
illinois requires it, even if you're from out of state.
that's why we're the only range in Chicago.
most people just go across the line to Indiana.
didn't he just apply for a card?
well, it takes 30 days. He said he couldn't wait that long.
I thought I understood the contours of my life.
a guy like me didn't need a gun.
but then suddenly, I didn't have a choice.
he just kept saying, "I need to be ready. I need to be ready."
so he was angry?
uh, not angry. He was...
he was desperate.
Hey, Theo. What's up?
Hey. Do I know you?
Yeah, we hung out that one time at the vending machine.
Hey, this is Theo. He's a regular.
do you, uh, remember seeing this guy here about two months ago?
kind of nerdy? Yeah, I think so.
they wouldn't let him shoot.
well, I saw him outside.
he didn't want to shoot. He wanted to shoot up.
he wanted to know where he could buy some heroin.
heroin? I thought the coroner didn't find drugs in his system.
heroin is only detectable for 72 hours.
but they also didn't find any organ damage indicating lonterm use, which could mean our guy was a light user or a new one.
maybe he was a drug dealer, you know, like a suburban kingpin, like that lady on cable.
what if our guy went to the south side looking for drugs or found his way there?
roosevelt Park is a well-known drug market.
it's also close to the river and the interstate.
I think we should take a look.
should we really be handing out fliers down there?
I know it's not the safest neighborhood, but there're helpful people there, too.
maybe Russell can send some police officers to canvass with us.
no, that will never fly.
I know that neighborhood.
we show up own there with a bunch of cops, nobody'll talk with us.
come on. There's safety in numbers.
we'll go during the day. We'll be fine.
Hey.
I thought if we came down here alone, people would talk to us.
we're not wanted here.
and if river John made it to this neighborhood, neither was he.
did you see this guy?
did you see this man?
sure, man. Dorky white dude.
he is your daddy? No. No, he's not my daddy.
what do you ow about him?
right now, nothing. You need to break me off.
information ain't free, and your pockets look deep-- say...$1, 000 deep.
are you serious?
a man is dead.
now it's $2, 000.
people die down here every day.
you offend my sensitivity.
maybe I should just roll through your neighborhood one day.
yo, Tre!
punk.
if he knows something, we'll get him to talk. But, uh, we pick our battles, especially down here.
Alex Donovan! You're causing trouble?
I met flora when I was a rookie.
her ex-husband was a stickup man down here.
he tried to break into her apartment one night, then she shot him three times, right by that window.
made quite an impression.
on my husband, too.
so I saw you outside, wandering around.
I thought you left the police.
I did. I work different types of cases now, but people aren't as helpful as I remember.
nice to see you haven't changed.
nothing scares me anymore.
I was here before gangs.
I'll be here long after they're gone.
you've seen this man?
no, babe.
and the only person who was willing to admit they did see him is this kid named tre, but his help is pretty pricey.
foolish man-boy, mouth writing checks his butt can't cash?
you mean Preston.
what is she doing?
looks like Flora is reaching out to a different type of network.
Preston Sharpe III.
you'd best be opening your mouth.
or what?
Oh, I'm-a call your father at work again, make him punch out early.
then he's gonna punch you out.
what you smiling at?
we're not cops. We just want his name.
I got no name.
but he was on the block a couple months ago.
I'm out.
Hey. We're not done.
you need to get your hands off me, man.
we just want to know what he was doing here.
were you selling him drugs?
hell, no. He was a window shopper-- not buying, just looking.
for what? - For his wife.
we were married seven years.
but in the end, she needed more help than I could give her.
drugs and a man looking for his wife in the wrong neighborhood.
and a gun.
he didn't know how to use it, but now we know why he thought he might need to.
well, he loved her. Look at the lengths he went through to find her.
or maybe he was trying to find her to hurt her.
and we don't even know if he did find her.
the search alone could have gotten him killed.
all true, which means anyone he met along the way is a suspect.
I'm Greta Wilkes. Alex told me to meet him here.
Oh, of course. I'm Lindsey.
it's nice to meet you. - You, too.
Hey. How'd it go with the notebook?
I could only restore one page.
not everything can be repaired.
I'm sorry. It's okay. Uh, thank you.
why don't you come on in, see how it all works?
no, thanks. I should get going.
it was nice to meet you, though. - You, too.
looks like list of local addresses.
looks like our guy had other ideas on where to find his wife.
there's, like, 20 of 'em.
so we do what we always do-- divide and conquer.
Hey. How's it going?
the porn's over there.
have you seen this man?
we think he may have been around here a couple months ago.
I'm sorry. I don't recognize him.
Thanks. You can keep that.
d.m.v. Public library, an empty lot.
it's all so random.
maybe it's part of some plan he didn't get a chance to execute.
or places he thought his wife worked?
an empty lot?
the places on the list are pretty far apart.
I mean, they'd be tough to get to by train or even foot.
maybe he had a car.
Yeah, but if he could have been anywhere, the car can be anywhere, too.
it's been two months since he died.
if he did have a car, there's only one place it would be now.
we have 17 unclaimed vehicles in the system since river john's death two months ago.
he was searching for his wife. He was, uh, anxious, he was in a hurry.
so look for anything messy. Clothes, food, wrappers, toothbrush, hair comb anything like that.
anything else?
let's go.
how did you know?
I did it myself for six months after I left the force, chasing after leads, running into the dark...
Lucy? Your daughter?
this is detective Russell. Meet me in row "g," section 4.
I didn't care how it looked, and I didn't care how I looked or what I said.
all the conventions just slid away, because the only thing that mattered was her.
this is the first time you mentioned what you did when you were gone.
why all the secrecy?
I was your partner, Alex.
I know how hard it was for you.
you remember the guy I became after Lucy was kidnapped?
you mean the guy Chicago P. D. decided to ease into a half pension so he wouldn't screw anything else up?
that guy is kind of hard to forget.
well, let's just say I got worse before I got better.
the doe's prints are all over the car.
we ran the V. I.N.
it's belongs to a Jack Carson out in Downers Grove.
you're Jack Carson? - Yeah.
sorry I'm not dead.
do you know this guy or not? - Yeah.
he rolled up with a cracked engine block a few months back.
Hey, what, check the oil?
never thought of that.
paid cash or one of my beaters.
why would he buy a junk car?
well, now you'd have to ask him that.
that's hilarious.
look, he bought the first thing I showed him, didn't look under the hodi, didn't negotiate. Probably wouldn't know what to look for anyway.
how about the car he came in with? Is that still around?
Yeah, it's around. Um, there's the alternator. Muffler's over there.
look, I can do this all day.
it's worth more divvied up, saves me the hassle of getting it registered.
uh, do you remember anything about the-- the license plate before you tore up the car?
maybe there was a logo on it? Or-- or the color?
Yeah, I remember green-- the color of the money he paid me with.
look...
I don't like your dog, and I don't like you.
but hey, I'm just a guy.
She--she's a cop.
Yes, very beautiful, but a cop, and I don't think she likes you either.
she comes with a gun and cuffs and all sorts of things.
a taser. - Yeah, taser. Ha ha.
now you want to try again?
anything you remember about the license plates?
it was white, maybe.
had a bell on it.
like a- a liberty bell? - Sure. Whatever.
see? That wasn't so hard. Get the Taser.
just kidding.
Lindsey, with bells on the license plates.
11 states have bells on their license plates?
hard to believe.
but they're all these specialized commemorative plates now, and any group can pay and get one.
for instance, the Utah hand bell appreciation society.
that is very not interesting.
I guess we should look at the missing persons lists, see if there's a photo on of those states that matches the sketch of river john.
okay. I'll make coffee.
Yes, please.
wait. I found him.
look. Henry Morse from Indianapolis-- that's only three hours from Chicago.
let's call Alex.
if there was a missing person's report... someone there is looking for him.
so let's bring him home.
I was born in Indianapolis.
I went to school here, grew up here.
and I worked so hard for this house.
a lot of happy times here with friends and family.
and then it all come crash in down.
Candace. - We're on the rea.
you a friend of Henry's?
um, I'm Alex. - Jerry.
actually, I didn't know henry all that well.
we just met recently.
Oh, nice guy.
you look up "accountant" in the dictionary, there would probably be a picture of henry.
knew the tax code by heart, but he couldn't fix a gutter to save his life.
was he married?
he was. Uh, Anna and henry got divorced over a year ago.
not sure what happened.
daddy. - Hey.
daughter named Claire-- she was uh, 9, I think.
want some? Go see mom.
you, uh... - no, thanks.
is, uh, henry okay?
he was murdered in Chicago a couple months ago.
Oh, my god.
you have any idea where his wife might be now?
no. Um, sorry. I really can't help.
I should go. Excuse me. Thanks.
so I did some, uh, digging in our school library using LexisNexis, and I found out that henry and Anna's divorce was finalized a year ago.
and Anna has full custody of 10-year-old Claire.
Yeah, I checked the phone records.
I couldn't find any Anna Morse's in Chicago.
I checked her maiden name, too.
I couldn't find anything.
um, have we found a relative?
Yeah. Henry has a sister Elaine Morse.
but there's no current address listed here for her-- Benjamin, put that away right now!
um, what about Anna? Does she have someone locally?
Oh, good idea. Let's take a look.
uh, according to her public record here, she has a brother named Frank Breen.
I'll call Alex.
Frank Breen?
excuse me. Is your name Frank Breen?
Yeah.
I'm a friend of Henry Morse.
I was hoping you could tell me where I could find Anna and Claire.
Hey. 'M talking to you.
come on. Get up. - Okay.
can we talk now?
what are you, a private eye?
Henry was murdered. - Really? Good.
what's so good about it? - Henry abused my sister.
she was afraid he'd start in on Claire.
where are they? - I don't know.
she doesn't want me to know.
Anna left town with Claire almost a year ago to get away from him.
no one's heard from them since.
Mr. Donovan. Welcome to Indianapolis.
Alex. Thanks for seeing me.
detective Russell gave me a call. I'm happy to help.
I heard about Henry Morse.
he was looking for his wife and daughter. Was it your case?
not really a case.
Henry said she kidnapped their daughter, but the wife had legal custody, so our hands were tied.
Anna's brother claimed that she took off because henry was abusive.
he feels strongly about it.
he abused her?
no. Yeah, I never heard that.
and if that were true, she would have put it on the record so she could keep him away from her.
maybe she decided to take off to chigo instead.
I doubt it. Henry said she started using drugs again--heroin, I think.
well, that would explain the parts of town where he was looking for her.
I think he was gonna appeal the custody judgment and take Claire away from her.
for something that wasn't a case, you know the facts pretty well.
Henry and I got to be pretty close.
I just wish there was more I could have done.
he was in here every day. He was calm at first, but then...
the longer his daughter was missing, the more agitated he got.
he didn't believe you when you said your hands were tied, he didn't understand how you didn't have the same urgency he did or why you couldn't sense his pain.
then he realized you couldn't help him. He decided to go out on his own.
how did you know that?
because that's what I said the day when my daughter Lucy was kidnapped.
she was my obsession. I was willing to do anything, go anywhere, trust anyone. I had to find her.
and did you?
Henry said he hired private investigators, child recovery companies.
but they just took advantage of him.
he went into debt looking for Claire.
his house is in foreclosure.
when was the last time you saw him?
about three months ago.
he asked me to trace a voice mail that came into his office.
it was from a pay phone in Chicago.
and after a few days, I called his office, but never heard back.
days turned into weeks.
I figured he'd gotten himself into some trouble, so I filed a missing person's report.
what was on the voice mail?
I don't know. He never played it for me.
I need to hear that message. That's what started henry on his journey.
I can call Indycomm and see if they saved it, but we don't have time for that. I'll-- I'll be in touch. Thanks.
who are you again? - I'm his brother.
Henry never talked about a brother.
Really? He never, never talked about me?
no. - I thought he forgave me, and now-- now he's gone.
could I... just take a look inside?
maybe there's a photo or a letter...
of course.
take all the time you need.
that was interesting.
Hey, Alex, what are you doing?
here. Take it. - What?
here.
press 1 to play saved messages.
recorded august 12th, 3:40 P. M...
daddy, it's me. I need you.
please help me.
we have to find her.
10 years old.
but if it's a kidnapping, won't the FBI be getting involved?
all the evidence this was a kidnapping is circumstantial.
Anna had custody.
she could do whatever she wanted, and henry never proved that she was using drugs.
Russell can't call the FBI yet. It's up to me.
so what do you want us to do?
we know who he was.
this is a guy who would do anything, talk to anyone, so we've got to talk to anyone, everyone.
that's a lot of people. - You think this is funny?
I'm sorry.
I wasn't clear.
we need to expand our search, just like henry did-- not just dealers, users.
we're looking for Anna now, to we need to go where people like Anna hang out, where they live-- downscale bars, weekly hotels, flophouses.
okay, so we'll come up with a list.
he needed to dig deep. So will we.
this, uh, this could get dangerous.
I can go alone, if you're uncomfortable.
Hey. We're comfortable.
I mean, not totally comfortable, but...
whatever you need, Alex.
Yeah.
Hey.
do you know this man or this woman?
who the hell are you?
we're just wondering if either of them was here.
you're kind of cute.
so are you. You're like Brad Pitt, which is why I'm so nervous.
let's go.
Yeah, he was here.
for real? He stayed here?
I didn't say that, but he was here.
he asked me if I had seen that woman.
I had no idea what he was talking about.
that was his wife. - Well, whatever. He wouldn't stop.
he was asking everybody.
finally had to tell him something just so he would shut the hell up.
sent him to this kid Tre?
the corner boy?
Yeah, he keeps his ears to the ground around here.
he can find anyone or anything.
this guy sent henry to Tre.
I'm calling Alex back.
so we can go to Roosevelt Park by ourselves again?
I'm calling Russell.
tre, stop!
Hey. Never good to run, Tre.
you don't just let the police walk up on you.
Henry comes to see you and then washes up in the river a few days later.
you're the last person we know who saw him alive, so unless you give us something else...
he came to me because everyone knows that I know.
know what exactly? - Everything.
okay, then I guess you know henry's wife Anna was an addict.
her drug of choice was your drug of choice.
I'm guessing she was a regular customer.
man, you ain't got nothing.
only a matter of time.
maybe I want a lawyer.
and I want a search warrant.
do you want me to call your old man first or should I get some big scary dudes with guns to come kick in the door?
okay, man. Fine. I knew the woman.
you knew Anna Morse?
whatever her name was.
the woman that the dude was looking for.
did you tell him where she lived?
she was a customer. That information is confidential.
this is important, Tre. Where was she?
maybe you didn't tell him, but it's in your best interest to tell me.
I didn't know, all right?
she came around every once in a while looking to score.
but usually she paged me. I'd make a drop on one of my runs.
so you know where she lives?
no. We never go door-to-door.
streets, alleys-- she was real needy, man.
she'd be paging me from all over.
so Tre was selling drugs to Anna. We know that much.
bend that, we don't have anything.
we can't even keep him for possession you think your wife was buying drugs from this guy, you'd wait around for her to show up.
or you could follow him on one of his runs and hope he leads you right to her and your daughter.
tre said he made deliveries to her all over the city.
that could be dozens of addresses, and I doubt this knucklehead carries a rolodex.
a list of addresses... henry had a list of addresses.
they were random, nonsensical-- a library, a bakery.
maybe he was following Tre and keeping track of all of the stops.
you went to all these places?
Yeah, we need to go back... this time not with henry's picture, with Anna's.
excuse me, everyone. - Hi.
does anyone here recognize this woman?
it's very important that we find out who she is.
there's a little girl who's in a lot of trouble right now, okay?
please. Anyone?
Hey, man. I'm back.
I was wondering if you'd seen this woman.
it might have been a couple months ago.
Yeah. She used to buy lollipops a couple times a week.
um, do you know where she lived?
those lollipops were for someone who might be in trouble.
I saw her go in that building right there, the one with the awning.
thank you so much.
I didn't know her, but yeah, she lived on my floor.
the three of them moved out a month ago.
three of 'em? - Sure. They lived with a guy.
the landlord says they have surveillance just inside the building.
I went back over the week before Henry Morse was found in the river.
take a look at this-- two days before he washed up.
he got her. He found his daughter.
he looks scared, but scared of what?
keep rolling.
that's him. That's the guy that lived with them.
I found her.
she looked just as I remembered her.
but we never had a chance.
Henry rescued his daughter that morning, and he's killed that night.
and now she's back with her drug addict mother and whoever else.
wherever Anna and Claire were and when they moved out of the apartment, they didn't want anyone to know where they were going, so she didn't forward the mail.
the manager was about to throw it out. We got there just in time.
well, here's something. This one's addressed to "Oscar Temple." Think that's the guy?
possibly it could be someone who lived there before her.
I still get mail from the last two people who lived in my apartment.
what is it?
it's a personal letter to Anna Morse with no name or return address, but there's a street number-- 369 mulberry drive.
so?
the Morse family lived at 371 mulberry drive.
her next door neighbor knew where she was?
Hey! That's evidence.
arrest me. - Don't push it.
369 mulberry drive-- Gerald Powell.
Jerry. He's the, uh, the friendly soccer dad.
you know him? - We met, and he lied.
if he knew she was in Chicago, he might know where she is now.
I'm gonna check this in, let's go.
Hey!
you knew Anna Morse was in Chicago.
we found the envelope and the money.
I was just helping her out, all right?
helping her out?
you were sending money to a junkie.
you think she was using that money to pay her rent?
Anna needed a fresh start. She'd been through enough.
Henry had been abusing her for years.
enough with this abuse crap. Anna was a drug addict.
maybe she lied to you, but you definitely lied to me.
I had no idea who you were, man.
you show up here asking question for all I knew, you were another one of henry's P. I.S.
I-it's okay, honey. It's--it's all right.
it's okay.
did you ever hear her talk about a guy named Oscar Temple?
who are you? - Indy P. D. Answer the question.
no, no, I didn't.
where is she now? - I don't know.
look, I sent the money to the address in Chicago because I thought that's where Anna was.
what about Claire? Where is she? - She's with her mother.
so you haven't talked to Anna? She hasn't called you?
I'm not answering any more questions without a lawyer.
the only thing I'm guilty of is trying to help a friend.
it's confirmed. Oscar Temple lived with Anna and Claire.
Oscar's got three priors for assault, did time at Statesville pen, out on parole since 2007.
what are you doing? - He's lying.
you don't know that! - I'm not leaving here until he tells me where they are.
look, I told you-- - I know you're using.
excuse me?
the candy in your pocket.
look, I'm not a cop anymore, but I used to be.
that's a tell for a heroin addict--dead giveaway.
but you're snorting it, right? That way there's no needle marks.
so were you and Anna using together.
a little smack to take off the stress of suburban?
some people can manage a habit. Most people can't.
I think you better leave.
look, I'm not here to bust you or break up your marriage.
you need help, but that's a separate decision.
this is about something else.
this is about being a parent, a father.
Anna wasn't rational.
we have no idea what she might have done to henry or what she might do to Claire.
if it were your little boy out there with someone who could hurt him, wouldn't you do anything to make sure that didn't happen?
of course, but Anna didn't hurt Claire, and she wouldn't kill Henry.
how do you know?
because I spoke to her.
when?
yesterday. I called her after you came by the first time.
it's like I said. I had no idea who you were.
she asked me if henry was with you, and I told her that you said that henry was dead.
she didn't know? - No.
she had no idea. She was shocked. She started crying.
addicts are great liars, jerry.
not to other addicts.
she thought henry was alive.
where was she? - Um, I don't know. Um...
some pay phone-- Ohio, I think.
give me that.
5-1-3? - Yeah. She was stressed.
s-she couldn't talk. She wasn't alone.
call the Ohio police.
trace this number.
we can find her.
when we got the call after you confirmed the local number, we traced it to this location.
it wasn't a pay phone. It was a landline.
did you try talking him down? - Of course. He wasn't interested.
says he won't go back to jail.
should have thought of that before.
we approached. Shots were fired.
that's when we called for backup.
any of your men injured?
luckily, no, but we've got an armed a dangerous criminal in there with a woman and a little girl.
we're not taking any chances. - We should...
get out!
I'm not a cop, all right?
I'm unarmed.
I'm not here to arrest you.
don't move!
I won't come any closer. I just want to talk.
can we-- can we just talk, please?
think about what you're doing.
just - just put the gun down and let's just talk, okay?
just put it down before the situation gets any more out of control.
I promise I won't do anything.
where is she?
sweetie. It's okay, honey.
it's okay. You're gonna be okay.
it's--it's gonna be okay.
um, I'm a friend of your daddy's.
come here. Sweetie, take my hand.
it's okay. It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.
love can drive you to the darkest places.
I went farther than ever thought I could,
I did things I could have never imagined.
but at some point, for a guy like me, even with all the love in the world...
the road ran out.
I was just a regular man...
a husband, a father...
and maybe I won't be there to see her grow up, but at least I know the last words I've ever said belong to her.
my darling Claire, my sweet pea,
my silly, sensitive, beautiful daughter...
I love you.
my name is Henry Morse.
Hi.
I just wanted to come by and thank you for your help.
it's a bit of a messy situation, but I think it's gonna be okay.
you found her?
we did.
good.
and I'll find our daughter, too.
think back.
do y remember your best friend as a kid?
is he still your best friend now?
do you talk?
or did time just change things, change you both...
until you lost the friendship and whatever made it special in the first place?
I had friends, I had good times, and I didn't want them to end.
I wanted those days to last forever.
Hey, get back here!
Hey! Hey, stop him!
Hey! Hey, get him!
it's a stray!
that's all the food we had!
grab him! Grab him!
Jim, where are you?!
I was part of something once, and for a while...It was magic.
but now...
I'm just someone's guilty secret.
Hey, Candace, when did detective Russell send this over?
actually, this one's from me.
I found an old case online.
I asked Russell to give us the file.
how old is "old"?
the body was found abou18 months ago.
it was buried near lake ward by a campground there.
lake ward doe. Our story begins.
so our john doe is a white male, probably in his late 20s.
he's buried about a mile from some cabins near the lake.
cause of death?
head trauma.
body was wrapped in a sheet with no labels or markings.
how long was the body buried?
about a year.
this murder happened two a half years ago?
how far did thpolice get with it?
the chicago P. D. Was working with a local sheriff's office.
they tried, but no luck.
they did do a sketch, though.
Oh, man. They made the guy ok like bigfoot.
I'll get the autopsy photos, see what I can do.
it says here he was wearing jeans and a tshirt, and the tshirt had a cartoon on it.
uh, yeah. Very common comic book characters. Police couldn't trace it.
I'll reach out to the network. Maybe our John doe was a fanboy.
um, what about this dog-- the one that led the kids to the body?
Oh, we don't know that it led them there.
it was a stray, Walter. Not lassie.
Hey, I saw this dog on animal planet.
every day it went to the cemetery and sat on its owner's grave for, like, five years.
I mean, what if this actually is John doe's dog?
Oh, come on.
even if it was, you're not gonna find a dog in those woods.
we could try.
thank you, but I have allergies.
I love dogs, but I pet a chihuahua, and ten minutes, these are boxing gloves.
okay, Walter, you and lindsey will take the tshirt.
Tyler and I will follow up on the dog.
Alex? - Yes, chief?
talk to the local sheriff's office?
you always say the local guys don't get listened to enough.
I'm on it.
okay.
kids play on this hillside all the time.
it's amazing to think that body was here underath them.
you never had anything like this before?
never.
before now, worst case I had was a 17yearold with alcohol poisoning
threw up in my car.
not too many murders around here.
I was the first one on the scene. I secured it.
I did everything by the book
rounded up the kids who found him and took all their statements.
anyone live clby?
we got 12 cabins down about a mile, and I gave your people a list of renters for the past few years.
and your boss should've told you I'm not a cop.
my network-- we try to help solve john and jane doe cases.
you look like a cop. You should apply.
the body was wrapped in a cotton bedsheet, so we're thinking he waskilled somewhere else.
they could've driven up the fire lane and then carried him over from there.
Yeah, you mentioned the fire lane in your report.
one of your leads involved a couple in a truck?
Yep, when I found out how long he'd been on the ground,
I went back through my notebooks, and the only unusual incident I have around that time is a couple.
they were arguing in their S. U.V.
well, would you recognize them?
not likely. The whole thing lasted about a minute.
I shined my light on 'em, made 'em get a move on.
you don't think I'd let two murderers drive away, do ya?
kids have always played on that hillside.
I was one of them.
if you told me back then that I was playing on my own grave,
I wonder how that would have felt.
three of the people I talked to say they fed a stray dog within the past week.
this was Walter's stupid idea.
how come he gets to go to the comic store?
you get to be with me.
Yeah, and, like, a million mosquitoes.
why'd you pick this case anyway?
what are you doing?
what? You wanna call a dog, you whistle.
see, this-- this is a completely new side of you, Candace.
I bet you did the whole campout skinny dipping thing when you graduated.
in your dreams, Tyler.
we're trying to trace a John doe victim who wore this shirt.
the cops say there must be a million of them with those characters on it.
Yeah, maybe. But not together.
what does that mean?
these characters
they're owned by different publishers.
you almost never see 'em together, unless it's a special edition.
it's like marvel and dc on one shirt.
so does that tell you who made it?
Nah, but I know where your John doe got it.
it was designed for San Franciscon.
is that a comic book conference? - Convention.
Yeah, a big one. There was, like, over 10, 000 people there.
that shirt's from, like, five years ago.
we're never gonna get anywhere.
Hey, don't worry. They didn't sell it.
they gave it out to gofers. Employees.
Yeah, if you worked for the convention, the organizers
they'll hook you up with some perks.
well, you think we could get a list?
maybe. Still a couple hundred names. Hey, but it's a start.
Yeah.
what are you doing?
pit stop.
you can keep hiking if you want.
just... leave the food.
this must be where the kids who found the body went swimming.
you seem to know your way around this place pretty well.
I'm guessing you've been here before?
Yeah.
is was our family vacation place when I was a kid.
I loved it here.
I don't know. It always felt...
magic.
and, uh, then a couple years ago, my mom got breast cancer.
and it didn't look like she'd be okay.
my dad
he said he'd take her anywhere in the world that she wanted to go.
I mean, she could've had paris or the pyramids.
but this is what she wanted
to come here.
I'm sorry.
it's okay.
we came back here for a few weeks, and...
that's kind of when she turned around.
she beat it.
and I know that it was doctors and treatments and all, but...
that's when I knew this place really is magic.
and the idea of someone being murdered here...
it's wrong.
don't move.
she's starving, Tyler.
all she wants is your food.
good. Good girl.
got her.
dog, stop!
no, no!
Oh, my god.
you know I'm telling everyone this story.
okay, here she is.
we cleaned her up a little bit.
this is it?
your stray is a labrador poodle, also known as a labradoodle.
she's 4 or 5.
how long was she out there?
I couldn't say. She got enough food from visitors.
if she was living under one of the cabi, it could be years.
we didn't find a collar on her.
no, but we can do better than that.
she has a microchip under the skin.
as long as the owner's registered in the database...
there you go
could it really be that simple?
what if Walter was right?
what if this dog did belong to John Doe?
then we just got his name.
so are you gonna call Russell?
no, not ye at this point, all we have to go on is walter's theory, based on something he saw on tv.
Yeah, but he could be right.
I mean, Michael Axton could be our John Doe.
maybe. But let's at least find out if he's missing.
I mean, a dog stayin his owner's grave for that long? It's pretty strange.
you don't know those woods stranger things have happened.
who is it? - We're loing for Michael Axton.
you just found him.
my dog?
we found her up in woodland, near lake ward.
uh, the vet who checked her out said that she'd been there for a while.
Yeah, well, that makes sense. That's where I lost her.
I go up to those woods every once in a while.
Katie ran away about a few years ago.
Katie? That's her name?
Yeah. I checked in all the local animal shelters at the time, but eventually I just gave up looking.
well, she led some teenagers to a crime scene.
there was a body buried in the woods.
a body? Oh, my god.
I honestly don't know what to say about that.
that is...
really...
well, Katie's still at the vet's office, but we can arrange to have her brought back to you.
actually...
about that, look, I'm happy Katie's safe and everything, but I don't think that's such a good idea, 'cause, uh, I'm kind of in the middle of a divorce right now, and I'm not really set up for a dog.
Hey. Maybe you guys could help me find katie a new home.
so Katie didn't lead us to our John Doe after all?
Nah. Axton lost her up in lake ward a few years ago.
but you're safe now, girl.
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
would she really stay in the same place all that time?
well, there was this guy and his dog on the discovery channel
Walter, can we please just forget about the dog for a second?
what's the story on the tshirt?
um, actually, I think we got something.
our doe was a gofer.
of course he was.
I have no idea what that means.
Oh, he was a volunteer at a comic book convention five years ago.
how many volunteers are we talking about
I called the promoters and got them to email me a list.
there were 12, 000 people total, 300 volunteers.
great. So we have to follow up on 60 people apiece. - Yep.
uh, hang on. Lindsey, the sheriff made a list of everyone who rented a cabin at lake ward around the time our doe was buried.
Yeah, I saw that list. I typed these names into my computer.
maybe we can compare the two lists.
if someone who rented a d a cabin also was a volunteer at the convention...
I can try.
it's just my laptop, guys.
I've got a program that merges data, but it's gonna take a minute.
you okay? - Yeah.
but if you guys are gonna keep Katie, I'm gonna find another group.
okay, got it.
I merged cabin renters with convention volunteers, and only one name overlaps
maybe now we should call Russell.
might be a little early for that. Is there any contact info?
no. This list is just names.
I can call again, see what the promoters have on file.
let's do it. Tyler, how close are you on the sketch?
almost done. - Great. This could be him.
our John doe could be Jake Lucas.
we got this address from the convention promoters.
it was listed in the contact info for Jake Lucas.
Yeah, I'd say that's Jake.
he was living here when I started as the manager, but not anymore.
so you knew him? - Yeah.
nice guy, always fired up, always full of dreams and schemes.
I liked him.
can you tell us when was the last time you saw him?
probably four years ago, right about the time he moved out.
he moved out? - Yeah. Crazy, if you ask me.
guy's got a prewar unit
small, but beautiful, and even better, rentcontrolled.
so what happened?
guy goes and buys a dog.
it's insane, because building policy says no pets.
and I give him a choice.
he keeps the dog and gives up the unit.
can you tell us, uh, where we could find him?
uh, his friends, family?
not really, but I kn he forwarded his mail, so maybe you can track him down.
okay. Thank you. - Thank you.
I'll call Russell. maybe she can get us the forwarding address.
how solid are we on this?
looks promising. We tied the name "Jake Lucas" to the tshirt on the victim and the cabins near where the body was found.
we also got an I. D. Of our sketch from Jake Lucas' old landlord.
so this should clinch it. If this is his brother.
Hey. Uh, you're the one who called?
Yeah. Alex Donovan.
this is Candace Butler and detective Grace Russell from Chicago P. D.
detective?
and you are? - Uh, John Lucas.
please come in. - Thanks. Yeah.
so, uh...
this has something to do with my brother Jake?
Mr. Lucas, when's the last time you saw your brother?
uh, it's been a while.
how long is "a while"?
uh, three years, maybe. II don't know.
I'm sorry to tell you this, but a body was found up in woodland.
we think there's a chance it could be Jake.
Oh. No, it's not possible.
Jake's in india.
how do you know that?
because I got an email from him this morning.
it does look a lot like Jake.
this doesn't make any sense.
Jake's living in india.
uh, this is Becky, our sister.
I got here as soon as I could.
look, I know it can't be Jake.
he's been emailing me, too.
we can check that.
I mean, the police can look at the computer and trace those messages.
we can. I'll have a tech unit take a look.
did your brother ever spend antime around lake ward?
uh, of course. We all did.
it was a vacation place for our family.
we still goonce in a while.
how often do you talk to Jake?
not often, but that's kinda just his thing.
I mean, he's flaky. Flaky Jake.
it's what we call him.
Yeah, one day you get an email from Paris
"it's Jake, just checking in," and next month it's Burmascow, you know, aand then just nothing for months.
would you say you guys are close?
we are, but Jake's hard to describe.
when he surfaces, he's great.
we talk about everything.
but then he goes off again.
ready?
go get it!
come on!
Jake's always been different.
he's adopted.
um... our parents couldn't have a third child, a,uh...
since he never knew his own family,
I just think he tries to create that bond with other people. So...
I hope we're wrong, but if wdid find Jake, the D. N.A. Will prove it.
we need your help finding a sample.
okay. Um, how do we do that?
well, ybe if you have an old hat or toothbrush or an old comb
anything you have that belonged to Jake would be helpful.
so what did the emails say?
uh, I only read a few.
they were short-- stories about Mumbai and how much he misses everyone.
and detective Russell's tracing 'em?
and she's checking the D. N. A.
otherwise, we're on our own.
her lieutenant won't let her get more involved until there's a positive I. D. On the body.
I don't understand why.
everything that we have says that it's Jake Lucas.
I know. But we could still be on the wrong track.
we're not.
and if Jake Lucas is who I think he is, things just got a little more interesting.
according to th tr tecades, he's kinda famous. - For what?
well, not famous in like you'd know his name, but I bet you know his work.
he created the Katie application.
that's the guy? - What? - What's that?
it's a social application-- a pretty successful one, actually.
I guess he named i after his dog.
it's this prog myou download onto your phone.
what's it do?
basically it just mops up whatever information's around you, like, uh, cell phones, wireless signals, and it sends it to your private network.
it's for your friends.
it creates a picture of ere you are and what you're doing.
like "Candace is at a coffee shop in chicago, and it's raining outside.
I don't know. I like having you guys with me, but not everywhere I go.
I agree, but, uh, according to his brother and sister, he did like creating bonds with people.
Mm. I guess so. He developed Katie with three old friends from high school, and they sold it for a fortune.
any names?
Victor Gupta, software engineer, Layla Demchak, marketing and P. R.
and Michael Axton, C.E. O.
michael Axton? We met with him.
he's registered as Katie's owner. He knew Jake Lucas?
I'm not waiting on Russell to get D. N.A.
I say we do what we always do
get to know Jake Lucas.
his family deserves to know who he really was.
I can't believe you think the body they found is Jake Lucas.
Yeah, you didn't, uh, mention that the dog was his, mr. Axton.
you didn't ask.
and honely, I didn't thinkthere was any connection.
he can't be dead. I get an email from him every-- every once in a while.
he's in India or something.
Yeah, his family gets them, too. The police are checking into that.
right now we just want to learn more about him.
so it was the, uh, the four of you who started the company, right?
Yeah. Yeah.
we all grew up together outside the city, in Naperville.
um, we built the whole company in this guest room at his boarding house.
it was you, Victor Gupta and a third person-- a woman?
Layla. Yes. We don't speak anymore.
that was the divorce I mentioned.
uh, we got married young. Didn't last much past the sale.
I wanted to ask you about the name of the company.
repeat N. P. Incorporated
it's a little unusual, I know.
but the "N. P. " Stands for "nuclear particles."
Jake liked it because the letters are "Peter Pan" scrambled.
Peter Pan.
so he was the type of guy who didn't want to grow up, hmm?
Yeah, he was a kid at heart, but that's what made him special.
Yeah, we spoke to his brother and sister.
they never mentioned a thing about any of his success.
Jake probably didn't tell 'em. I'm not surprised.
Jake did what he wanted to do. That's how I ended up with Katie.
what do you mean?
Jake had a trip to india planned and showed up at my door and said that Katie's registered to me now.
I didn't love the idea.
Katie didn't either, I guess.
is any of this helping you?
the, uh, the boarding house that you mentioned-- would you mind showing that to me?
Yes. Okay. No problem.
it's true. The first Katie application was written in one of our rooms.
this is where Jake went when he left his apartment?
Yeah, a few years ago now.
the four of them always treated me like one of the family, not like a landlord.
this is it.
okay, Michael, you go on in.
I want to grab something.
this is it. This is where it all started.
in the beginning, when you don't have much, all you can think about is more.
but when I got it, all I could think abwas how happy I was when I had less.
it's a pretty small room for business meetings.
you guys must have really liked each other.
see for yourself.
is that what I think it is?
I used to come by some nights with my camera.
even then, I knew something special was happening.
it's on? Okay.
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the clubhouse.
this is where the magic happens.
uh, look. Look. Here. Here.
uh, this is the magic sofa.
get a shot of the magic sofa.
and, um, look, there hiding behind that door
come with me
the lovely Layla Demchak...
mistress to Michael.
Hey, could you talk about the product, please?
it's called Katie.
it's the cure for loneliness.
with this program, your friends, your friends...
Hi, mom.
are always with you, 24/7, wherever you are.
isn't that right, Katie?
excuse me.
Hey. How's it going?
we rushed the D. N.A. It's official.
our doe is Jake Lucas.
detective? - You still there?
uh, yeah. I like the guy.
I was kinda hoping it wasn't him.
Anluck on the emails?
well, we traced them. It wasn't easy.
whoever sent them knew how to cover their tracks.
And? - You want to gues where they came from?
not Mumbai?
try the south side of Chicago.
I always wanted o to India.
I tried to convince everyone to come, but they all had too much going on.
the real world
it c really get in the way.
it didn't matter.
in the end, I never left Chicago.
we traced the emails to this address.
it's just a room, really.
been leased about two years now.
you don't know who leased it?
it's crazy, I know, but, uh, it's not exactly Trump towers.
I met him about two years ago.
he came in. I made him a deal on the space.
he, uh, paid in cash, just like he has every month since.
in person? - Never. Only by mail.
and would you recognize him?
back then? I don't think so.
truth is, if you told me you were him, I'd believe it.
Thanks.
well, what do you think?
we'll seize the computer, see if there's anything we can trace.
okay. Good luck, I gotta go.
where? - Go see Victor Gupta.
he was one of the original four in Jake's company.
why him?
uh, he stisu conlts for repeat N. P. I want to see what it looks like.
you look concerned.
honestly, I don't know anything about Gupta.
but I'm starting to feel like every time a case goes somewhere, you guys have been there already.
we're just trying to help. - Know.
but if Gupta turns out to be a suspect, maybe a detective should be at his first interview.
well, then come with me.
look, we don't want to get in the way.
we don't work like you do. We don't work cases in a straight line. We learn.
and I appreciate that, and I think you should go.
I'm just saying, you're here to help us, not the other way around.
that's Layla Demchak, one of Jake's friends and partners.
Idwith her share of the payout.
res in this neighborhood aren't cheap.
Yeah, and neither's the merchandise.
the smaller the outfit, the higher the price tag.
let's go in.
Jake's number one rule was he had to be able to bring Katie to work.
and you're a consultant?
I'm on the board, but I like to stay involved in the daytoday.
I can see why you wouldn't want to leave.
this has to be the coolest office I've ever seen.
Yeah, day care center, basketball at lunch.
in the mind of a modernday peter pan, it all seems idyllic, but this is business.
it can't be all jelly beans and puppy dogs.
no. You know, we started as friends, but the more successful we got, the more that changed.
why is that?
time, personalities, egos. It's natural.
you know, Jake didn't know business, but after a while, he knew enough to start pushing Michael pretty hard.
and I wrote the code for Katie, but Jake still took full credit.
I kind of resented that a little.
uh, what about Layla?
Layla and Jake didn't fight. I don't know why.
she always seemed to, uh, understand where he was coming from.
his brother and sister said they used to call him "flaky jake."
uh, it doesn't sound like the guy you're describing, he was unpredictable, but he was serious about the company.
can I ask about the cabin up in lake ward?
any idea why Jake was there?
Yeah, it was right before the big sale.
Jake invited us up there to talk about it.
it was his decision, but, uh, he wanted to make sure we were all behind it.
were you? - Of course. It was a solid offer.
I mean, we had a nice run together, but it w time to move on.
so you all wanted to go your separate ways?
it was time.
they were great days, but you know when a party is winding down.
Jake was heading off to India, so one way or another, things were coming to an end.
aske w always such a free spirit.
thank you for letting me see these.
where should I put them? Uh, anywhere on the desk.
Jake and I used to talk for hours.
I can tell you that without him there holding us together, the three of us would have been at each other's thats.
we don't even speak now.
Really?
I just thought you guys were so happy.
nothing's ever quite the way it looks.
did you argue? - Sure.
on some level, you're always the same person you were in high school.
but if you never leave those people,
I guess you never get rid of that baggage.
how'd it go with Victor Gupta?
uh, interesting guy. He admits to resenting Jake a little.
uh, Walter thinks he's involved.
he never even t him.
uh, you know Walter. He says he's got a feeling.
you see why I te t youo leave the cop stuff to us?
Hey. We were all just filling in the blanks while you waited for your D. N.A. Result.
so what blanks did you actually fill in?
well, Jake's whole group is a little off.
I agree. I talked to Axton for a while.
he never told me anything I couldn't have read in an article about the company.
the whole thing just seemed too rehearsed.
and Gupta has got a chip on his shoulder about who really created Katie.
and Layla's got some issues, too. I'm guessing that she's an alcoholic.
was she drunk? - It's beyond that.
alcoholics don't always look drunk.
I think she needs a drink to function.
the point is, something's not right.
hang on.
our cybercrime techs took a look at the computer we seized.
it had to be clean.
they recreated part of the cache and found a name.
those emails were sent from an account owned by John Lucas, Jake's brother.
no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Wait.
first you tell me that Jake is worth millions, and now you're saying I'm the one that sent those emails?
your brother sold his company for $14 million.
II didn't know that. - Maybe you did. Your parents are gone.
maybe you knew if Jake died, that money would go to you and Becky.
no. This is crazy. IIis that true?
Mr. Lucas, we're just trying to understand.
the police think that the emails came from an account in your name.
can you explain that? - No, I can't explain that.
maybe you were angry at him. Maybe his success was too much for you to handle.
no, look, we never talked about work.
come on. You expect us to bieve that?
I sell office furniture, all right? III read the sports pages.
I don't know anything about the tech world.
II knew.
he called here a couple of days before he went
before he was supposed to go to India.
it was like always.
I mean, he was bad about keeping in touch, but when he did, it all came pouring out of him.
he said one of his ideas worked.
a company wanted to buy him out.
but he didn't want to sell.
why didn't you tell me?
because it was Jake.
I loved him, but I thought it was just another one of his schemes.
she's right.
I wouldn't have believed it either.
that's the tough side of Jake-- the whimsy.
you know, it's something you expect in a 5yearold, you might tolerate it from a teenager, but in a grown man, it can wear you down.
enough to make you want to kill him?
I loved him.
now look, I can't explain the emails.
all right? If it looks like I sent them, then somebody is setting me up.
you think Becky was right?
about what? - About Jake.
maybe he invited them up there to the cabin 'cause he changed his mind.
maybe he decid not to sell the company.
in other words, he told them there wouldn't be any payd.
sounds like motive to me.
Walter. Hey.
Hey, man. It's me. It's Walter.
you okay?
dude, it's on, right now.
I told you something was up with that Gupta guy.
okay, Walter, calm down.
he just left his house.
all he'ght, s got the look, man-- beadyeye mcgee.
he was looking around to see if anyone was following him.
are you following him?
Yeah! He left the city.
I tracked him to this little restaurant at lake and olive.
Oh, man.
he's not alone. Axton just showed up.
you're not gonna believe who he's with
you gotta get out here.
okay, Walt, sit tight. Don't do anything. We're on our way.
that's the place, but I don't see Walter.
Oh. There they are.
whatever they're talking about, it looks tense.
there's Walter.
I thought you told him not to do anything.
Hey.
get out of there!
I'm too far away. I can't hear anything. I'm gonna try to move to thear.
Walter, it's Grace.
I'm calling an observation team. They'll be here in ten minutes.
it could be over by then.
just give him-- give him a second. Maybe he'll come up with something.
I told you those emails were a bad idea. We were reckless.
we had to do something, all right?
Jake would never travel that long without getting in touch.
okay, so what do we do now?
we're covered. They think John sent the emails. We're fine.
we're not fine. I'm not fine.
Hey, look, we have come this far, all right?
we stick to the plan. Nothing changes.
I'll promise you one thing
if the cops
the friendship was falling apart.
I'm guessing it ended that day up at the cabin.
four of them knew what happened, one of them wound up dead.
I don't get it. They made so much money.
who gained anything by Jake dying?
unless he real wanted to kill the deal.
at the end of the day, it was his decision.
that's a lot of money to apeople to walk away from.
but Jake wasn't about the money, was he?
no, he was about the friendship, so I can imagine him saying,"let's keep this thing going."
Yeah, and I can imagine their answer.
Yeah, well, it makes sense.
Jake didn't want to sell, the three of them did.
so that's why they killed him?
$14 million is why they killed him.
even if that's true, I've got three people giving alibis for each other.
I need one of them to crack, or it's a prosecutor's nightmare.
of the three, I think Layla's your weakest link.
I agree.
I think it's really good for you.
it's an awesome color, and it's the type of dress that you can wear during the day
Ahem. Uh, excuse me?
uh, sorry, honey I don't think I carry your size.
uh, no. I was wondering if any of you own a silver coupe.
that's mine.
okay, maybe you can help me T.
iii really appreciate it.
uh, it-- I just gotta get to this utility box.
if you, uh, move your car down the street, that'd be great.
resu.
ma'am, I'm gonna need you to step out of the car, please.
they arrested her for drunk driving?
she blew a 2. 0 on the breathalyzer.
more than twice the legal limit.
I had a boss once who was an alcoholic.
four hours without a drink, and hetarted shaking.
maybe she didn't kill him.
it didn't have to be all three of them.
it would only take one of them to snap.
Yeah, but baseon what we heard at the restaurant, all three of them at least covered it up.
some reward for wanting to keep your friends together.
you okay with this?
it's legal. It's good enough for me.
see you in a few hours.
sorry for the delay.
central booking was pretty backed up.
is there anything I can get you?
you know what I need.
listen, I'm sorry about all this. I know you're hurting.
but, uh, we need to talk to you, and we need you sober.
I shouldn't have been driving.
it's not about that. It's about Jake Lucas.
we saw you with Michael and Victor at the restaurant.
we heard what you said to them.
what happened at that cabin, Layla?
nothing.
we decided to sell the company.
but Jake didn't want to sell the company.
he didn't want the four of you to stop being friends, right?
Layla, it's okay.
you can tell us now...
unless you want to feel like this forever.
asked us to come up to lake ward, just like in the old days...
he said.
when we got there, heold us he didn't want to go through with the sale.
did he say why?
he said the four of us mattered more to him than what he could get for it.
remind us of how we started.
how did everyone take it?
not well. Michael and Victor were angry at first.
I know they wanted out.
but you know what? After a while, they agreed not to sell.
they wanted the money, but they...
they knew what he meant.
Layla, did one of them want the money enough to kill Jake?
no.
this wasn't about the money.
Jake was out on the deck, drinking a beer and looking at the stars.
I waited so I could talk to him alone.
I said,"jake, whether you like it or not, we're not kids anymore."
I'm a grown woman.
you were in love with him.
what do you think?
I always had been.
but he didn't reciprocate.
he knew how I felt about him.
he'd known it for years.
but I was his best friend's girl, and it was more important to keep us together as a group.
it was hard for Layla to hear me say, "I love you all"
when what she wanted to hear was, "I love you."
why can't we just stay together that is not gonna work!
it's about the... - no!
and the diffence broke her heart.
I couldn't tell them.
michael found Jake thnext morning.
it looked like an accident.
and all the talk of friendship went out the window.
the three of you covered up his death and sold the company.
is that what happened, or is there another reason, Layla?
we all had our phones out.
we were trying to find a signal to call the police.
and then Victor said,"do you realize "that if jake told just one person that he changed his mind, that no one is ever gonna believe that we didn't do this?
and he was right.
so, yeah, we made it look like it never happened.
an yes, we took the money.
look how happy it made us.
looking back, it was my mistake.
I didn't want to grow up.
I wanted to go back to the beginning...
to the days when all I had was an idea and the four of us were still best friends.
but you can't go back.
people change.
friendships evolve.
I tried to keep our grp together when it was meant to come apart.
places can be magic, and certain mes in your life can be magic, too.
but when they go, you have to let them go.
I know that now.
you still take them with you
the great days, the days when you were part of something, when all of you joined together because you cared about the same thing.
old friends
they may not be with you, but they're a part of you.
and then there's Katie
the one friend who never left my side.
I miss her.
but I can move on now.
my name is Jake Lucas.
I used to think that love was easy
I used to think that once u found the right person, everything else just fell into place.
but love ain't like that.
it takes work
a whole lot of work.
this is ridiculous. I'll call the desk.
sometimes it seems easier to just...
walk away...
to find something or...
someone else.
but that ain't the answer.
if it was...
we wouldn't be here.
no facebook, no tweaking for a whole week! It's tweeting!
you don't even know what it is! I hate you!
Savannah Destiny Bailey! Don't you ever talk to your mother like that!
you're not my mother! My real mother was abducted by aliens!
you're a cyborg imposter! A mean, cold cyborg imposter! That's it!
no more...
missing
star
aloha
I hope this is good. I had plans.
have you been drinking?
it's Saturday night. I took a taxi.
no, justice doesn't sleep or party.
and clearly, neither do you.
okay, Walter, let's see what you got, and at this hour, it better be good.
um, well, I was looking at this newspaper article.
this is big, you guys.
double Doe, people-- two vics.
Jane and John Doe? - Yeah.
twice the crime, twice the justice.
they were found stuffed behind a generator at a sleazy motel called the Aloha Inn.
it's about 150 miles west of Chicago.
cause of death-- shotgun blast.
Yeah, they were found frozen about eight months ago, buried in the snow, but the M. E. thinks they were probably there a couple months before that.
there's not many details. Jane Doe is about ten years older than John.
she, and she was wearing support hose.
sounds to me like they were having an affair.
because nothing says sexy like support hose.
Yeah, I'm with Lindsey-- older woman, younger man, skeevy motel.
maybe she was a cougar.
well, we don't want to jump to conclusions.
well, it's not exactly a huge leap.
says here she was in her 30s. I mean, why the support hose?
maybe she worked on her feet
nurse, waitress, hairdresser.
teacher.
looks like there was some decomp before they were frozen.
we're gonna need a facial reconstruction. That's you.
work your magic, and then we can all say hello to the Aloha.
maybe it's nice on the inside.
I know the place looks crappy, but that didn't matter to us.
we were there for a reason.
something great was gonna come out of it.
one of you guys, go talk to the manager.
Tyler, you go talk to the ladies.
I'm going to, uh, stop by the
the local station, let the police know what we're up to.
hi there. I was wondering if you could tell us about, uh, Jane and John Doe, the two dead bodies they found.
you don't want a room? We rent by the hour.
w-well, that's just rude.
no, not you. I mean just the whole idea.
the idea of you and me is rude?
not that we have-- I'm no- there's no idea.
I'm saying I don't even have an idea.
the-- the idea of the idea
208. - What?
I already told the cops. All I did was find them.
go see 208. - 208?
he lives here. If anyone knows anything, it'll be him.
Thanks.
Hello, handsome.
what's a fine-lookin' thing like you doing here?
that is a lovely skirt-type thing that you have on.
thank you.
but talk ain't free, and girl's gotta make a living.
that sounds fair.
I only have, uh, 40 bucks. Is that enough?
well, sugar, it will have to do.
and I'm not just a bargain.
I'm a cop, and you're under arrest.
uh, we're looking into the two bodies
come in. Come in!
you're letting in the vapors.
that's a lot of...
those are for the revolution.
will it be televised?
maybe. The world's economy... Crashing.
what you call money, I call toilet paper.
what do you call toilet paper?
this... revolution
when do you think it's gonna happen?
Oh, soon. That-- that's why you're here, right?
Yeah, of course. Of course.
you know, we heard that you were the guy to talk to.
those two people that they found-- the bodies
they were a part of it.
they got too close to the truth.
Yes. Oh, yes!
I-I-I knew it. I knew it!
Oh, it was inevitable.
Oh, I tried to warn them.
you saw 'em? - Oh, I saw them.
I saw-- I saw them, And then-- and then zipper killed them!
zipper? - Oh, zip-- zip-- Zipper killed them.
slow down, slow down, slow down. - Zipper killed them.
who's Zipper? - The killer.
zipper killed them. Oh, Zipper killed them!
this time it's just a warning.
what happened?
one of those working girls was a working cop.
does she know anything?
I'm sure she knows a lot of things.
and I'm fine, thanks.
nothing. - Unless you count the crazy guy in room 208.
zipper killed them! Zipper killed them!
zipper killed 'em? That was in the police report.
Yeah, but the local cops checked it out. It didn't mean anything.
what if it does?
what, you think we should buy into the crazy guy's theories?
I think that's the only lead we have.
well, Zipper could be a gang name.
maybe it's someone who's fast, like a runner-- someone who zips.
what about a druggie, like a tweeter?
I think you mean, uh,"tweaker."
well, look, I've got "clothing attachment" or "carnival ride.
Oh, wait. That's right, the Zipper!
I went on that with my ex, first date.
did you throw up? - No, not until later.
marvelous midway carnivals
says here the Zipper is their most popular ride.
I'm sure that's bringing back a lot of find memories for Lindsey, but, uh, our John and Jane were killed by a shotgun and not a carnival ride.
hang on. Their schedule is on here, and right now marvelous midway is just outside Chicago.
but last fall, they were in Galesburg, Illinois.
home of the Aloha Inn. Well done, Walter.
there you go! Where do we start with?
we'll start here. It looks promising.
Hey, excuse me. Do you run this?
Yes, I do.
we're wondering if you or anybody around here has ever seen these two people.
what's the hurry, huh? We just want to talk.
Hey, Zipper. Who's your friends?
come on, seriously, let go of me!
hold still. So I take it you're friends here with Zipper.
I hope you're not too close, 'cause he's in some pretty serious trouble that you don't want any part of.
toss over your wallets.
the thing about my wallet
there's a badge in it.
the trouble I'm talking about is a murder investigation.
let's see the badge. - No problem.
but if it comes out, this officially becomes attempted robbery.
I'm gonna have to arrest each and every one of ya.
or... you let me keep my badge in my wallet in my back pocket, let us walk out of here with your good friend Zipper, no harm, no foul.
come on.
all right, Zipper. Let's talk.
I didn't shoot 'em. I swear.
we have a witness who says that you did.
all right, I saw them, okay?
the bodies. But I didn't kill 'em.
what else did you see?
I saw a car, all right?
I was staying at the Aloha, and I-I heard a couple of shotgun blasts, went outside and saw this car tearing out of there.
what kind of car?
it was big-- S. U.V.dark, american, you know?
the doer must have been inside that.
that's a real nice story, Zipper, but our witness says he saw you with the bodies.
so quit lying to me.
it's the truth, all right?
I didn't kill 'em. - You ran, Zipper. Why do that if you're innocent?
all right, okay. I...
I robbed 'em. Okay?
but they were already dead. It's not like they needed that stuff anyway.
what did you take? - Why should I tell you?
you're not even a cop.
no badge, brother.
it's in my car.
mine's not.
come on. I didn't hurt anyone.
you didn't exactly help them either.
did you see the victims before they were killed?
no. I mean, I heard them talking.
I couldn't really make out what they were saying, but the woman
she had an accent, like a Chicago accent.
what did you take from their bodies?
just their wallets.
Oh, and the woman's wedding ring.
they had I. D.'s in their wallets. Did you see their names?
what about their car?
sold it to a chop shop.
where? - I don't know. I got a dude.
what kind of car was it?
so you just stole their money and their car, that's it.
I guess they just walked to that generator themselves.
okay, I did that, too.
Yeah, that's real humane, Zipper. The jury's gonna love it.
Hey, I didn't kill them. - So you say.
listen, I'm serious, okay? Just wait a sec.
those two were in something, all right?
that woman had a wad on her-- 10 grand cash.
anything else you're ready to share?
I may have lifted something else from her.
it's in with the rest of my stuff.
I didn't smoke, but it wasn't a lighter to me.
it was a reminder of everything I had and everything I could lose.
so I blew it up and posted it on the network.
any hits?
well, according to a history professor in Memphis, it's part of a family coat of arms dating back to the mid 12th century.
the o'Hennessy family
they don't look very Irish to me.
what did you expect, leprechauns?
all right, well, I'll get the phone book.
how many o'Hennessys can there be?
Oh, it's not just o'Hennessy.
there are a ton of modern variations
hennessey, Hensey, Hinchy...
uh, professor sent me a list.
okay, uh, you get the phone books.
I'll order the pizza.
is this the Hennessey residence?
Hello, uh, my name's Alex Donovan.
Yes, ma'am, we're trying to track down someone named o'Hennessy who may be missing.
Yeah, I'm looking for Mary Hennessy.
is, uh, is there a John o'Hennessy there? - This one.
Hi, a James H-Hennessy or o'Hennessy?
wow, you look amazing.
Yeah. Work thing at my boss'.
you know, insurance people rockin' it out.
my goal is just to keep the drunken gropes to single digits.
anyone want a beer?
I just talked to half the Irish people in Chicago.
I could use a good, strong Irish brew.
what about Irish pubs? I mean, there's tons of them in Chicago.
they're filled with Irish people.
wait, you're kidding, right? There's, like, hundreds.
you can't turn a corner in Chicago without walking into an o'Malley's.
Jane was wearing support hose, and the police checked all the restaurants in Galesburg, but she had a Chicago accent.
maybe she waitressed locally.
I like it. Where do we start?
how about a place called Hennessey's?
definitely looks Irish.
you sure?
excuse me.
we're hoping someone here might know this woman.
we think her last name might be Hennessey.
Oh, my god. That's Julia.
is she...
I'm sorry.
did Julia work here?
Julia owned the bar with her husband Sean Hennessey.
is this him?
no, it's not.
I'm Julia's husband.
who the hell are you?
I told the cops when Julia disappeared that something terrible happened to her.
Julia would never just walk away.
it was almost a year ago.
can't believe it's taken this long.
what was he doing with my wife?
is he the reason she was killed?
we don't know that.
can you tell us who he was?
just some kid who came into the bar a lot.
I think his name was, uh, J.D. or J. P. something like that.
were J. P. and your wife close, Mr. Hennessey?
what are you saying?
they were found outside a motel
the kind that rents by the hour.
my wife was not having an affair!
Julia would never do that.
Mr. Hennessey, please sit down.
we're not judging your wife.
we're just trying to find out who killed her.
sorry.
but Julia would never have cheated on me, not after all we've been through.
what do you mean, after all you've been through?
Julia and I went through a rough patch.
we'd only had the bar for eight months when Julia disappeared.
before that, we big jobs in the city
uh, sales and P. R.
we made great money, kept up with the Joneses...
but we forgot what was important.
our marriage started to fall apart.
so what did you do?
we took stock and realized that
michigan Avenue and the white collars wasn't really us.
this is.
so when things got bad, you moved back here?
we sold everything we had to buy this place.
it was our second chance.
your wife was found with, uh,$10, 000 when she died.
do you have any idea what that might have been for?
no.
Hey, how's it going?
good. Uh, Alex and Russell are questioning the husband.
I thought I'd work the staff.
mm, good idea. - How about a Guinness?
uh, you know, I would love a Smithwick's and a quarter, please.
Thanks.
irish quarters.
my maiden name is Donaghue.
I grew up in a big Irish catholic family.
probably a lot like the Hennesseys, actually.
Sean's folks passed away, but at least he's got his brother.
thank god for Connor...
and the neighborhood.
there was a collection almost every week, trying to boost the reward.
have
what about this guy?
that's J. P.
uh, yeah, he came in here a lot.
can you tell us anything about him?
I don't know.
I-I think he was a handyman or a plumber?
I mean, he always had grease on his hands anf, um, he wore a kind of 1-piece jumpsuit.
shirt/pant combo.
Yeah, either that or a NASCAR "T.
were he and Julia, uh, close?
Julia got me.
she really did.
and I got her, too.
we had a lot of stuff in common, like we were both trying to start over.
there were rumors.
Where's Sean?
um, he's in the office with the police.
Connor, these are the people who identified Julia.
thank you. It's been terrible not knowing.
Oh, um, Alex, this is Connor, Sean's brother.
is he okay-- my brother?
Yeah, he's okay. They're just, uh, finishing up.
it's nice to meet you.
but, uh, we still have some work to do, unless you got an I. D. on the john Doe.
uh, no, just a nickname-- J. P.
thank you so much.
Hey, I think I'm gonna stick around.
work the staff? - Precisely.
you all right?
Yeah, I guess.
I just kept hoping somehow she'd walk through that door one day.
grease stains and a shirt/pant combo.
and NASCAR t-shirts-- a mechanic.
uh, hello! NASCAR's not just for mechanics anymore.
I think we should stick with the bar, see what we can find out about them.
it's pretty clear that J. P. was Julia's boy on the side.
we don't know that yet.
Oh, come on. Sean admitted the marriage was in trouble.
Yeah, he said that's all in the past.
well, then there's the hourly motel, The rumors
it all adds up. - It adds up to a theory.
so come up with a better one then.
all right, I divided up the area around the bar.
let's start with this list of mechanics.
there's 15 of 'em.
Yeah, I knew him. Hell, I hired him.
the kid really knew cars-- such a nerd about it. I loved that.
I used to love digging into an engine.
no matter how flashy a ride looks on the outside, it's the guts that tell you how that baby's gonna run.
he came in once or twice a week to help out.
I paid him cash. Always went by "J. P."
is there anything you can tell us about him?
he used to talk about "back home"
uh, Minnesota, Montana-- I don't know. Somewhere with an "m."
that's a start. - All right, thanks for your time.
you know, I never figured a girl would get J. P. killed.
my money was always on the fellow came looking for him.
wait. Someone was looking for J. P?
Yeah, a guy named Danny Walker.
where can we find this guy?
from what I hear, you don't get to Danny without an introduction.
folks say he's the local drug dealer.
I got nothing-- zip, nada. Any info on J. P?
we got you a twofer, Walter. - What, you hit pay dirt?
looks like he was a mechanic who lived in a"m" state.
the owner of the shop said a local drug dealer Was looking for him name's Danny Walker.
I still got connections on the South Side.
I might be able to find the drug dealer myself.
well, if it's an "m" state, that narrows it down to eight.
we're getting in to missing persons right now.
seedy motels, now we've got drug dealers...
looks like our star-crossed lovers
really did have something to hide.
just because your marriage fell apart Doesn't mean Sean and Julia's did.
excuse me? - Look, all I'm saying is not every marriage goes south, even though it might look that way.
all I'm saying is not every John and Jane Doe is a saint.
marriages have problems. People work it out.
why can't you believe they did? - Why can't you believe they didn't?
look, I know everybody's into this,
but let's not forget we're all on the same team here.
now I might be able to find that dealer.
Tyler, you're with me. Candace, you're in charge.
everyone's into it?
I thought Lindsey was gonna break a chair over Walter's head.
how'd you find out about this place, anyway?
I told you, I still got connections on the South Side.
now don't say a word unless somebody asks you a direct question, okay?
I got it.
we're here to see Danny.
they're clean.
what can I get you?
we just want to talk, actually.
talk? I don't sell that here.
there's a guy-- owes me money. His name's J. P.
I've been looking for him for about a year now.
don't know him.
Really? I heard he worked for you.
you accusing me of lying?
I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm just looking for J. P.
his co-workers at the auto shop said that you stopped by a couple of times.
you know what a 289 hi-po is?
can't say that I do. - J. P. Did.
he restored this old mustang, and I needed to pay him for it.
my philosophy
keep things simple.
I needed the work, and Danny needed his car fixed.
I'll be honest with you.
J. P.'s dead. He was murdered.
I'm just looking for family or anyone to tell them what happened.
J. P. was good people.
he ever mention where he was from?
we had this whole, um, Cubs/Cardinals rivalry going on.
that mean anything?
St. Louis, Missouri-- with an "m.
that was Alex. The drug dealer thinks J. P. was from Missouri.
I'm telling you, the key to it all is back at Hennessey's.
it's where their lives intersected.
Hey, I think I found J. P.
white male, 25, from St. Louis.
girlfriend who filed the report said he was moving from city to city looking for work.
that explains why the police never found him.
they were looking 150 miles away in Galesburg near the Aloha Inn.
I'm gonna go back to the pub, see what else I can dig up.
um, can-- Um, can I get a Guinness?
his drinks are on the house. - Oh, thanks.
you were here with the cops this morning, right?
Yeah. I'm Walter Bailey.
I wanted to stop by and give you my condolences.
thank you. I appreciate that.
I'm gonna get out of here early.
everything's covered here.
thanks for stopping by.
Sean's been a mess for about a year now. We both have.
I can't imagine what he's going through.
Hey, everybody that works here seems to really like Sean and Julia.
so I gotta ask you...
what do you think of the rumors?
they were a great couple, but they always had issues.
Sean had a temper.
I was stubborn.
we fought all the time.
but you can fight and still be in love.
she was the one who wanted to move ck to the South Side and buy this pub.
Sean gave it all up for her.
and this is how she repays him-- by cheatin' on him?
so you believed the rumors then?
it's hard not to.
what about this J. P. guy.
nice kid. Maybe too nice.
Sean and J. P. were total opposites.
maybe that's why Julia liked him.
you ready for the big leagues?
what, me? No, no, no. I'm good, man.
Aw, come on. Hey, Mike, Walter here's got next.
no, no, no. I don't have next.
drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Yeah!
Hey, Kelly.
you must be Irish, because you certainly drink like one.
half Irish, half Scottish.
Ah, close enough.
I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but you don't look irish.
these rumors, Kelly...
what if they're not true?
I mean, do you want Sean to remember Julia as nothing but a cheater?
I never thought about it that way.
well, what's your last memory of her?
I mean, the last thing you two talked about.
she was planning something for Sean's birthday, but she never said what it was.
that drug dealer Danny Walker
ee was in New York around the time of the murders.
he's no longer a suspect.
you'll want to see this.
so I pulled some information on Sean Hennessey
his financial records, everything.
looks like Sean and Julia bought the pub from his brother Connor.
this is interesting.
Sean reported his shotgun stolen from the bar a week before Julia went missing.
let me guess-- a 12-gauge, just like the murder weapon.
and it gets worse.
your friend Zipper claims the car he saw fleeing the scene was a dark-colored american S. U.V.
Sean drives a 2002 Explorer, dark blue.
and he said he was working the day of the murders.
his alibi doesn't hold up?
no. Look at these gas and diner receipts from the credit card.
he was actually near Galesburg.
he was 4 miles from the Aloha Inn?
I have enough to arrest Sean Hennessey for these murders.
Yep, he's been this way for almost an hour.
wanted me to call everybody. Said he had some "big "news.
wake him up.
Walter. - It's not my walrus!
um, Walter, wake up.
you're not at the zoo, and you're not at home.
you're at Lindsey's.
didn't you say that justice never sleeps or parties? - Ohh! Yeah.
whose walrus was it, anyway?
I don't know. I'm dehydrated. My-- my tummy feels funny.
I'll get him some water.
can you hear me? - Yeah.
Russell's got a warrant out for Sean Hennessey's arrest. What's your big news?
wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
I got this.
birthday
I'm not sure that's gonna help Sean.
Julia was planning something for Sean's birthday.
if we can find out what it was, it'll tell us who murdered her and J. P. Maybe.
Walter, Russell came up with some pretty compelling evidence against Sean.
look, you always tell us that everything isn't always as it seems.
can't we give himng the benefit of the doubt?
let's go through it one more time.
I'm Julia and I want to buy my husband a special birthday present.
why was J. P. At the motel?
well, he's a mechanic that worked on old cars.
and Julia's got 10 grand on her.
10 grand and a mechanic?
what if it was a car? What if it was a real car?
a vintage model for 10 grand? That could be it.
what if the car meant something to both of them? - Yeah.
you know, Julia could have been planning something for Sean and still been cheating on him.
if Sean followed her and J. P. to the motel, and he thought the worst, he still could have killed them.
that's right, Lindsey.
but we need something more concrete, right?
and car dealerships.
we'll get you some addresses. Walter should go with you.
got it. Let me know if you find him.
Russell still can't find Sean. She thinks he may be in the wind.
well, out of the three places we've been to, this dealership has bought and sold the most vintage cars in the area, hands down.
good afternoon. Can I help you?
I was wondering if you'd seen those people
uh, probably in here about a year ago.
Oh, yeah. I talked to her about a '69 Firebird.
she came in here a couple of times, Really excited.
I think it was a gift for her husband.
the first time I met Sean, he was driving it
a gift for his 18th birthday.
our first date was in that car.
he was on top of the world, and he deserved to feel like that again.
she was gonna buy the car but backed out at the last minute.
I really could have used that commission.
you have any idea why she backed out?
she said someone else found a car for her.
I gotta ask-- why is this lady so special?
what do you mean?
another guy was in here today asking the same questions
brown hair, bad mood.
Sean. - Yeah. Thank you very much.
why was Sean at the dealership?
for the same reasons we were trying to find proof that he didn't kill his wife.
and Walter was right. Julia was trying to buy Sean a '69 Firebird.
he does sound like an innocent man.
who would benefit from Julia's death?
Julia was an only child.
Connor was Sean's only brother.
well, we know there was no life insurance policy.
Sean won't make any real money if he sells or inherits the bar.
Russell found out that Sean and Julia bought the pub from Connor.
apparently, he was in some real financial trouble.
wait, that's weird. Connor never said that he owned the pub before Sean and Julia.
why would he not mention that?
no one likes to admit their failures.
Yeah, but he had no problem telling me that Julia cheated on his brother.
so what if we're looking at this the wrong way?
what if Connor did something for his brother
something hard-core?
we don't think there was an affair, but to everyone at the pub, it looked like there was.
and if Sean and Connor believed the rumors,
Connor could have killed them for his brother.
so where was Connor on the day of the murders?
apparently, Sean just paid a visit to the Aloha Inn And your frid in 208.
he's been looking for answers.
Sean's retracing his wife's footsteps, talking to witnesses.
he's trying to prove his innocence.
what did you find out about Connor?
this just landed ony desk.
Connor had two failed businesses-- bankruptcy.
he inherited some money when his parents passed away and bought the pub.
then a year later, Sean and Julia bailed him out.
where was he on the day of the murders?
I don't know that, but days before Julia and J. P. were killed, his car was in the shop.
he rented an S. U.V. while the work was done
a dark blue Explorer, same make and model that his brother has.
well, that could be the same S. U.V. that Zipper saw leaving the scene.
so he rents an S. U.V.
that looks like Sean's and could have stolen his shotgun.
that's a lot of resentment.
you know, this doesn't look like Connor killed them to defend his brother's honor.
he did this so Sean would take the fall.
so Connor's last known address is his parents' house.
Alex, you stay behind me, And, Walter, you stay behind him. Understood?
Connor Hennessey. It's detective Russell.
step outside, please.
what's this about? Hey, what are you doing?
you're wanted for questioning in regards to the death of Julia Kowalski and J. P. Albrecht.
what? Get off me, man.
you got the wrong person.
you got the wrong guy!
stay down, sir.
get out of the way!
hold on.
drop the gun, Sean!
look, I know you're scared, okay? I know you're angry.
let's just talk about this for a minute.
there's nothing left to talk about. You know what he did!
don't move.
don't ever do that again, Alex.
I can't promise that.
you okay?
Oh. Yeah.
twice the justice, twice the cleanup, I guess.
so why didn't you just kill your brother?
why did you go through all the trouble of framing him for murder?
it had to be this way.
if I killed Sean, Julia would get the bar.
you did this to get control of a bar?
I hated Sean.
no matter what I did, he did it better.
I spent my whole life in his shadow.
do you have any idea what that's like?
so you set up a trap.
you knew Julia wanted to buy Sean a car, so you used that to lure her to the Aloha Inn.
Julia was cheatin' on her husband.
those two deserve what they got.
you're wrong.
there was no affair.
Julia and J. P. were innocent.
Sean saved Hennessey's from bankruptcy, and this is how you repay him?
I know what Sean did. I know because he never let me forget it.
he saved me, and he made sure that I said thank you every day.
well, I couldn't do it anymore.
Connor said he'd found the perfect car, and everything would be all right.
all I wanted was a second chance with Sean.
but Connor didn't let that happen.
if I learned anything from being friends with Julia...
it's that you fight for the people you love.
J. P. And I were together that day not because we were together, but because he was my friend.
he was helping me make things right.
my name is Julia Kowalski.
and my name is J. P. Albrecht.
it's late.
is everything okay?
um...
listen, that thing I said to you the other day...
it was mean. I was wrong and I'm sorry.
it's okay.
you were right about them.
relationships are about... hard work.
they were trying to do it.
Thanks.
WalterJr.get off my computer now!
I told you not to touch my things!
get out right now, before I throw you out! - mom!
you have five seconds! Five, four, three-- - mom!
I used to think that love was easy
I used to think that once u found the right person, everything else just fell into place.
but love ain't like that.
it takes work
a whole lot of work.
this is ridiculous. I'll call the desk.
sometimes it seems easier to just...
walk away...
to find something or...
someone else.
but that ain't the answer.
if it was...
we wouldn't be here.
no facebook, no tweaking for a whole week! It's tweeting!
you don't even know what it is! I hate you!
Savannah Destiny Bailey! Don't you ever talk to your mother like that!
you're not my mother! My real mother was abducted by aliens!
you're a cyborg imposter! A mean, cold cyborg imposter! That's it!
no more...
missing
star
aloha
I hope this is good. I had plans.
have you been drinking?
it's Saturday night. I took a taxi.
no, justice doesn't sleep or party.
and clearly, neither do you.
okay, Walter, let's see what you got, and at this hour, it better be good.
um, well, I was looking at this newspaper article.
this is big, you guys.
double Doe, people-- two vics.
Jane and John Doe? - Yeah.
twice the crime, twice the justice.
they were found stuffed behind a generator at a sleazy motel called the Aloha Inn.
it's about 150 miles west of Chicago.
cause of death-- shotgun blast.
Yeah, they were found frozen about eight months ago, buried in the snow, but the M. E. thinks they were probably there a couple months before that.
there's not many details. Jane Doe is about ten years older than John.
she, and she was wearing support hose.
sounds to me like they were having an affair.
because nothing says sexy like support hose.
Yeah, I'm with Lindsey-- older woman, younger man, skeevy motel.
maybe she was a cougar.
well, we don't want to jump to conclusions.
well, it's not exactly a huge leap.
says here she was in her 30s. I mean, why the support hose?
maybe she worked on her feet
nurse, waitress, hairdresser.
teacher.
looks like there was some decomp before they were frozen.
we're gonna need a facial reconstruction. That's you.
work your magic, and then we can all say hello to the Aloha.
maybe it's nice on the inside.
I know the place looks crappy, but that didn't matter to us.
we were there for a reason.
something great was gonna come out of it.
one of you guys, go talk to the manager.
Tyler, you go talk to the ladies.
I'm going to, uh, stop by the
the local station, let the police know what we're up to.
hi there. I was wondering if you could tell us about, uh, Jane and John Doe, the two dead bodies they found.
you don't want a room? We rent by the hour.
w-well, that's just rude.
no, not you. I mean just the whole idea.
the idea of you and me is rude?
not that we have-- I'm no- there's no idea.
I'm saying I don't even have an idea.
the-- the idea of the idea
208. - What?
I already told the cops. All I did was find them.
go see 208. - 208?
he lives here. If anyone knows anything, it'll be him.
Thanks.
Hello, handsome.
what's a fine-lookin' thing like you doing here?
that is a lovely skirt-type thing that you have on.
thank you.
but talk ain't free, and girl's gotta make a living.
that sounds fair.
I only have, uh, 40 bucks. Is that enough?
well, sugar, it will have to do.
and I'm not just a bargain.
I'm a cop, and you're under arrest.
uh, we're looking into the two bodies
come in. Come in!
you're letting in the vapors.
that's a lot of...
those are for the revolution.
will it be televised?
maybe. The world's economy... Crashing.
what you call money, I call toilet paper.
what do you call toilet paper?
this... revolution
when do you think it's gonna happen?
Oh, soon. That-- that's why you're here, right?
Yeah, of course. Of course.
you know, we heard that you were the guy to talk to.
those two people that they found-- the bodies
they were a part of it.
they got too close to the truth.
Yes. Oh, yes!
I-I-I knew it. I knew it!
Oh, it was inevitable.
Oh, I tried to warn them.
you saw 'em? - Oh, I saw them.
I saw-- I saw them, And then-- and then zipper killed them!
zipper? - Oh, zip-- zip-- Zipper killed them.
slow down, slow down, slow down. - Zipper killed them.
who's Zipper? - The killer.
zipper killed them. Oh, Zipper killed them!
this time it's just a warning.
what happened?
one of those working girls was a working cop.
does she know anything?
I'm sure she knows a lot of things.
and I'm fine, thanks.
nothing. - Unless you count the crazy guy in room 208.
zipper killed them! Zipper killed them!
zipper killed 'em? That was in the police report.
Yeah, but the local cops checked it out. It didn't mean anything.
what if it does?
what, you think we should buy into the crazy guy's theories?
I think that's the only lead we have.
well, Zipper could be a gang name.
maybe it's someone who's fast, like a runner-- someone who zips.
what about a druggie, like a tweeter?
I think you mean, uh,"tweaker."
well, look, I've got "clothing attachment" or "carnival ride.
Oh, wait. That's right, the Zipper!
I went on that with my ex, first date.
did you throw up? - No, not until later.
marvelous midway carnivals
says here the Zipper is their most popular ride.
I'm sure that's bringing back a lot of find memories for Lindsey, but, uh, our John and Jane were killed by a shotgun and not a carnival ride.
hang on. Their schedule is on here, and right now marvelous midway is just outside Chicago.
but last fall, they were in Galesburg, Illinois.
home of the Aloha Inn. Well done, Walter.
there you go! Where do we start with?
we'll start here. It looks promising.
Hey, excuse me. Do you run this?
Yes, I do.
we're wondering if you or anybody around here has ever seen these two people.
what's the hurry, huh? We just want to talk.
Hey, Zipper. Who's your friends?
come on, seriously, let go of me!
hold still. So I take it you're friends here with Zipper.
I hope you're not too close, 'cause he's in some pretty serious trouble that you don't want any part of.
toss over your wallets.
the thing about my wallet
there's a badge in it.
the trouble I'm talking about is a murder investigation.
let's see the badge. - No problem.
but if it comes out, this officially becomes attempted robbery.
I'm gonna have to arrest each and every one of ya.
or... you let me keep my badge in my wallet in my back pocket, let us walk out of here with your good friend Zipper, no harm, no foul.
come on.
all right, Zipper. Let's talk.
I didn't shoot 'em. I swear.
we have a witness who says that you did.
all right, I saw them, okay?
the bodies. But I didn't kill 'em.
what else did you see?
I saw a car, all right?
I was staying at the Aloha, and I-I heard a couple of shotgun blasts, went outside and saw this car tearing out of there.
what kind of car?
it was big-- S. U.V.dark, american, you know?
the doer must have been inside that.
that's a real nice story, Zipper, but our witness says he saw you with the bodies.
so quit lying to me.
it's the truth, all right?
I didn't kill 'em. - You ran, Zipper. Why do that if you're innocent?
all right, okay. I...
I robbed 'em. Okay?
but they were already dead. It's not like they needed that stuff anyway.
what did you take? - Why should I tell you?
you're not even a cop.
no badge, brother.
it's in my car.
mine's not.
come on. I didn't hurt anyone.
you didn't exactly help them either.
did you see the victims before they were killed?
no. I mean, I heard them talking.
I couldn't really make out what they were saying, but the woman
she had an accent, like a Chicago accent.
what did you take from their bodies?
just their wallets.
Oh, and the woman's wedding ring.
they had I. D.'s in their wallets. Did you see their names?
what about their car?
sold it to a chop shop.
where? - I don't know. I got a dude.
what kind of car was it?
so you just stole their money and their car, that's it.
I guess they just walked to that generator themselves.
okay, I did that, too.
Yeah, that's real humane, Zipper. The jury's gonna love it.
Hey, I didn't kill them. - So you say.
listen, I'm serious, okay? Just wait a sec.
those two were in something, all right?
that woman had a wad on her-- 10 grand cash.
anything else you're ready to share?
I may have lifted something else from her.
it's in with the rest of my stuff.
I didn't smoke, but it wasn't a lighter to me.
it was a reminder of everything I had and everything I could lose.
so I blew it up and posted it on the network.
any hits?
well, according to a history professor in Memphis, it's part of a family coat of arms dating back to the mid 12th century.
the o'Hennessy family
they don't look very Irish to me.
what did you expect, leprechauns?
all right, well, I'll get the phone book.
how many o'Hennessys can there be?
Oh, it's not just o'Hennessy.
there are a ton of modern variations
hennessey, Hensey, Hinchy...
uh, professor sent me a list.
okay, uh, you get the phone books.
I'll order the pizza.
is this the Hennessey residence?
Hello, uh, my name's Alex Donovan.
Yes, ma'am, we're trying to track down someone named o'Hennessy who may be missing.
Yeah, I'm looking for Mary Hennessy.
is, uh, is there a John o'Hennessy there? - This one.
Hi, a James H-Hennessy or o'Hennessy?
wow, you look amazing.
Yeah. Work thing at my boss'.
you know, insurance people rockin' it out.
my goal is just to keep the drunken gropes to single digits.
anyone want a beer?
I just talked to half the Irish people in Chicago.
I could use a good, strong Irish brew.
what about Irish pubs? I mean, there's tons of them in Chicago.
they're filled with Irish people.
wait, you're kidding, right? There's, like, hundreds.
you can't turn a corner in Chicago without walking into an o'Malley's.
Jane was wearing support hose, and the police checked all the restaurants in Galesburg, but she had a Chicago accent.
maybe she waitressed locally.
I like it. Where do we start?
how about a place called Hennessey's?
definitely looks Irish.
you sure?
excuse me.
we're hoping someone here might know this woman.
we think her last name might be Hennessey.
Oh, my god. That's Julia.
is she...
I'm sorry.
did Julia work here?
Julia owned the bar with her husband Sean Hennessey.
is this him?
no, it's not.
I'm Julia's husband.
who the hell are you?
I told the cops when Julia disappeared that something terrible happened to her.
Julia would never just walk away.
it was almost a year ago.
can't believe it's taken this long.
what was he doing with my wife?
is he the reason she was killed?
we don't know that.
can you tell us who he was?
just some kid who came into the bar a lot.
I think his name was, uh, J.D. or J. P. something like that.
were J. P. and your wife close, Mr. Hennessey?
what are you saying?
they were found outside a motel
the kind that rents by the hour.
my wife was not having an affair!
Julia would never do that.
Mr. Hennessey, please sit down.
we're not judging your wife.
we're just trying to find out who killed her.
sorry.
but Julia would never have cheated on me, not after all we've been through.
what do you mean, after all you've been through?
Julia and I went through a rough patch.
we'd only had the bar for eight months when Julia disappeared.
before that, we big jobs in the city
uh, sales and P. R.
we made great money, kept up with the Joneses...
but we forgot what was important.
our marriage started to fall apart.
so what did you do?
we took stock and realized that
michigan Avenue and the white collars wasn't really us.
this is.
so when things got bad, you moved back here?
we sold everything we had to buy this place.
it was our second chance.
your wife was found with, uh,$10, 000 when she died.
do you have any idea what that might have been for?
no.
Hey, how's it going?
good. Uh, Alex and Russell are questioning the husband.
I thought I'd work the staff.
mm, good idea. - How about a Guinness?
uh, you know, I would love a Smithwick's and a quarter, please.
Thanks.
irish quarters.
my maiden name is Donaghue.
I grew up in a big Irish catholic family.
probably a lot like the Hennesseys, actually.
Sean's folks passed away, but at least he's got his brother.
thank god for Connor...
and the neighborhood.
there was a collection almost every week, trying to boost the reward.
have
what about this guy?
that's J. P.
uh, yeah, he came in here a lot.
can you tell us anything about him?
I don't know.
I-I think he was a handyman or a plumber?
I mean, he always had grease on his hands anf, um, he wore a kind of 1-piece jumpsuit.
shirt/pant combo.
Yeah, either that or a NASCAR "T.
were he and Julia, uh, close?
Julia got me.
she really did.
and I got her, too.
we had a lot of stuff in common, like we were both trying to start over.
there were rumors.
Where's Sean?
um, he's in the office with the police.
Connor, these are the people who identified Julia.
thank you. It's been terrible not knowing.
Oh, um, Alex, this is Connor, Sean's brother.
is he okay-- my brother?
Yeah, he's okay. They're just, uh, finishing up.
it's nice to meet you.
but, uh, we still have some work to do, unless you got an I. D. on the john Doe.
uh, no, just a nickname-- J. P.
thank you so much.
Hey, I think I'm gonna stick around.
work the staff? - Precisely.
you all right?
Yeah, I guess.
I just kept hoping somehow she'd walk through that door one day.
grease stains and a shirt/pant combo.
and NASCAR t-shirts-- a mechanic.
uh, hello! NASCAR's not just for mechanics anymore.
I think we should stick with the bar, see what we can find out about them.
it's pretty clear that J. P. was Julia's boy on the side.
we don't know that yet.
Oh, come on. Sean admitted the marriage was in trouble.
Yeah, he said that's all in the past.
well, then there's the hourly motel, The rumors
it all adds up. - It adds up to a theory.
so come up with a better one then.
all right, I divided up the area around the bar.
let's start with this list of mechanics.
there's 15 of 'em.
Yeah, I knew him. Hell, I hired him.
the kid really knew cars-- such a nerd about it. I loved that.
I used to love digging into an engine.
no matter how flashy a ride looks on the outside, it's the guts that tell you how that baby's gonna run.
he came in once or twice a week to help out.
I paid him cash. Always went by "J. P."
is there anything you can tell us about him?
he used to talk about "back home"
uh, Minnesota, Montana-- I don't know. Somewhere with an "m."
that's a start. - All right, thanks for your time.
you know, I never figured a girl would get J. P. killed.
my money was always on the fellow came looking for him.
wait. Someone was looking for J. P?
Yeah, a guy named Danny Walker.
where can we find this guy?
from what I hear, you don't get to Danny without an introduction.
folks say he's the local drug dealer.
I got nothing-- zip, nada. Any info on J. P?
we got you a twofer, Walter. - What, you hit pay dirt?
looks like he was a mechanic who lived in a"m" state.
the owner of the shop said a local drug dealer Was looking for him name's Danny Walker.
I still got connections on the South Side.
I might be able to find the drug dealer myself.
well, if it's an "m" state, that narrows it down to eight.
we're getting in to missing persons right now.
seedy motels, now we've got drug dealers...
looks like our star-crossed lovers
really did have something to hide.
just because your marriage fell apart Doesn't mean Sean and Julia's did.
excuse me? - Look, all I'm saying is not every marriage goes south, even though it might look that way.
all I'm saying is not every John and Jane Doe is a saint.
marriages have problems. People work it out.
why can't you believe they did? - Why can't you believe they didn't?
look, I know everybody's into this,
but let's not forget we're all on the same team here.
now I might be able to find that dealer.
Tyler, you're with me. Candace, you're in charge.
everyone's into it?
I thought Lindsey was gonna break a chair over Walter's head.
how'd you find out about this place, anyway?
I told you, I still got connections on the South Side.
now don't say a word unless somebody asks you a direct question, okay?
I got it.
we're here to see Danny.
they're clean.
what can I get you?
we just want to talk, actually.
talk? I don't sell that here.
there's a guy-- owes me money. His name's J. P.
I've been looking for him for about a year now.
don't know him.
Really? I heard he worked for you.
you accusing me of lying?
I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm just looking for J. P.
his co-workers at the auto shop said that you stopped by a couple of times.
you know what a 289 hi-po is?
can't say that I do. - J. P. Did.
he restored this old mustang, and I needed to pay him for it.
my philosophy
keep things simple.
I needed the work, and Danny needed his car fixed.
I'll be honest with you.
J. P.'s dead. He was murdered.
I'm just looking for family or anyone to tell them what happened.
J. P. was good people.
he ever mention where he was from?
we had this whole, um, Cubs/Cardinals rivalry going on.
that mean anything?
St. Louis, Missouri-- with an "m.
that was Alex. The drug dealer thinks J. P. was from Missouri.
I'm telling you, the key to it all is back at Hennessey's.
it's where their lives intersected.
Hey, I think I found J. P.
white male, 25, from St. Louis.
girlfriend who filed the report said he was moving from city to city looking for work.
that explains why the police never found him.
they were looking 150 miles away in Galesburg near the Aloha Inn.
I'm gonna go back to the pub, see what else I can dig up.
um, can-- Um, can I get a Guinness?
his drinks are on the house. - Oh, thanks.
you were here with the cops this morning, right?
Yeah. I'm Walter Bailey.
I wanted to stop by and give you my condolences.
thank you. I appreciate that.
I'm gonna get out of here early.
everything's covered here.
thanks for stopping by.
Sean's been a mess for about a year now. We both have.
I can't imagine what he's going through.
Hey, everybody that works here seems to really like Sean and Julia.
so I gotta ask you...
what do you think of the rumors?
they were a great couple, but they always had issues.
Sean had a temper.
I was stubborn.
we fought all the time.
but you can fight and still be in love.
she was the one who wanted to move ck to the South Side and buy this pub.
Sean gave it all up for her.
and this is how she repays him-- by cheatin' on him?
so you believed the rumors then?
it's hard not to.
what about this J. P. guy.
nice kid. Maybe too nice.
Sean and J. P. were total opposites.
maybe that's why Julia liked him.
you ready for the big leagues?
what, me? No, no, no. I'm good, man.
Aw, come on. Hey, Mike, Walter here's got next.
no, no, no. I don't have next.
drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Yeah!
Hey, Kelly.
you must be Irish, because you certainly drink like one.
half Irish, half Scottish.
Ah, close enough.
I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but you don't look irish.
these rumors, Kelly...
what if they're not true?
I mean, do you want Sean to remember Julia as nothing but a cheater?
I never thought about it that way.
well, what's your last memory of her?
I mean, the last thing you two talked about.
she was planning something for Sean's birthday, but she never said what it was.
that drug dealer Danny Walker
ee was in New York around the time of the murders.
he's no longer a suspect.
you'll want to see this.
so I pulled some information on Sean Hennessey
his financial records, everything.
looks like Sean and Julia bought the pub from his brother Connor.
this is interesting.
Sean reported his shotgun stolen from the bar a week before Julia went missing.
let me guess-- a 12-gauge, just like the murder weapon.
and it gets worse.
your friend Zipper claims the car he saw fleeing the scene was a dark-colored american S. U.V.
Sean drives a 2002 Explorer, dark blue.
and he said he was working the day of the murders.
his alibi doesn't hold up?
no. Look at these gas and diner receipts from the credit card.
he was actually near Galesburg.
he was 4 miles from the Aloha Inn?
I have enough to arrest Sean Hennessey for these murders.
Yep, he's been this way for almost an hour.
wanted me to call everybody. Said he had some "big "news.
wake him up.
Walter. - It's not my walrus!
um, Walter, wake up.
you're not at the zoo, and you're not at home.
you're at Lindsey's.
didn't you say that justice never sleeps or parties? - Ohh! Yeah.
whose walrus was it, anyway?
I don't know. I'm dehydrated. My-- my tummy feels funny.
I'll get him some water.
can you hear me? - Yeah.
Russell's got a warrant out for Sean Hennessey's arrest. What's your big news?
wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
I got this.
birthday
I'm not sure that's gonna help Sean.
Julia was planning something for Sean's birthday.
if we can find out what it was, it'll tell us who murdered her and J. P. Maybe.
Walter, Russell came up with some pretty compelling evidence against Sean.
look, you always tell us that everything isn't always as it seems.
can't we give himng the benefit of the doubt?
let's go through it one more time.
I'm Julia and I want to buy my husband a special birthday present.
why was J. P. At the motel?
well, he's a mechanic that worked on old cars.
and Julia's got 10 grand on her.
10 grand and a mechanic?
what if it was a car? What if it was a real car?
a vintage model for 10 grand? That could be it.
what if the car meant something to both of them? - Yeah.
you know, Julia could have been planning something for Sean and still been cheating on him.
if Sean followed her and J. P. to the motel, and he thought the worst, he still could have killed them.
that's right, Lindsey.
but we need something more concrete, right?
and car dealerships.
we'll get you some addresses. Walter should go with you.
got it. Let me know if you find him.
Russell still can't find Sean. She thinks he may be in the wind.
well, out of the three places we've been to, this dealership has bought and sold the most vintage cars in the area, hands down.
good afternoon. Can I help you?
I was wondering if you'd seen those people
uh, probably in here about a year ago.
Oh, yeah. I talked to her about a '69 Firebird.
she came in here a couple of times, Really excited.
I think it was a gift for her husband.
the first time I met Sean, he was driving it
a gift for his 18th birthday.
our first date was in that car.
he was on top of the world, and he deserved to feel like that again.
she was gonna buy the car but backed out at the last minute.
I really could have used that commission.
you have any idea why she backed out?
she said someone else found a car for her.
I gotta ask-- why is this lady so special?
what do you mean?
another guy was in here today asking the same questions
brown hair, bad mood.
Sean. - Yeah. Thank you very much.
why was Sean at the dealership?
for the same reasons we were trying to find proof that he didn't kill his wife.
and Walter was right. Julia was trying to buy Sean a '69 Firebird.
he does sound like an innocent man.
who would benefit from Julia's death?
Julia was an only child.
Connor was Sean's only brother.
well, we know there was no life insurance policy.
Sean won't make any real money if he sells or inherits the bar.
Russell found out that Sean and Julia bought the pub from Connor.
apparently, he was in some real financial trouble.
wait, that's weird. Connor never said that he owned the pub before Sean and Julia.
why would he not mention that?
no one likes to admit their failures.
Yeah, but he had no problem telling me that Julia cheated on his brother.
so what if we're looking at this the wrong way?
what if Connor did something for his brother
something hard-core?
we don't think there was an affair, but to everyone at the pub, it looked like there was.
and if Sean and Connor believed the rumors,
Connor could have killed them for his brother.
so where was Connor on the day of the murders?
apparently, Sean just paid a visit to the Aloha Inn And your frid in 208.
he's been looking for answers.
Sean's retracing his wife's footsteps, talking to witnesses.
he's trying to prove his innocence.
what did you find out about Connor?
this just landed ony desk.
Connor had two failed businesses-- bankruptcy.
he inherited some money when his parents passed away and bought the pub.
then a year later, Sean and Julia bailed him out.
where was he on the day of the murders?
I don't know that, but days before Julia and J. P. were killed, his car was in the shop.
he rented an S. U.V. while the work was done
a dark blue Explorer, same make and model that his brother has.
well, that could be the same S. U.V. that Zipper saw leaving the scene.
so he rents an S. U.V.
that looks like Sean's and could have stolen his shotgun.
that's a lot of resentment.
you know, this doesn't look like Connor killed them to defend his brother's honor.
he did this so Sean would take the fall.
so Connor's last known address is his parents' house.
Alex, you stay behind me, And, Walter, you stay behind him. Understood?
Connor Hennessey. It's detective Russell.
step outside, please.
what's this about? Hey, what are you doing?
you're wanted for questioning in regards to the death of Julia Kowalski and J. P. Albrecht.
what? Get off me, man.
you got the wrong person.
you got the wrong guy!
stay down, sir.
get out of the way!
hold on.
drop the gun, Sean!
look, I know you're scared, okay? I know you're angry.
let's just talk about this for a minute.
there's nothing left to talk about. You know what he did!
don't move.
don't ever do that again, Alex.
I can't promise that.
you okay?
Oh. Yeah.
twice the justice, twice the cleanup, I guess.
so why didn't you just kill your brother?
why did you go through all the trouble of framing him for murder?
it had to be this way.
if I killed Sean, Julia would get the bar.
you did this to get control of a bar?
I hated Sean.
no matter what I did, he did it better.
I spent my whole life in his shadow.
do you have any idea what that's like?
so you set up a trap.
you knew Julia wanted to buy Sean a car, so you used that to lure her to the Aloha Inn.
Julia was cheatin' on her husband.
those two deserve what they got.
you're wrong.
there was no affair.
Julia and J. P. were innocent.
Sean saved Hennessey's from bankruptcy, and this is how you repay him?
I know what Sean did. I know because he never let me forget it.
he saved me, and he made sure that I said thank you every day.
well, I couldn't do it anymore.
Connor said he'd found the perfect car, and everything would be all right.
all I wanted was a second chance with Sean.
but Connor didn't let that happen.
if I learned anything from being friends with Julia...
it's that you fight for the people you love.
J. P. And I were together that day not because we were together, but because he was my friend.
he was helping me make things right.
my name is Julia Kowalski.
and my name is J. P. Albrecht.
it's late.
is everything okay?
um...
listen, that thing I said to you the other day...
it was mean. I was wrong and I'm sorry.
it's okay.
you were right about them.
relationships are about... hard work.
they were trying to do it.
Thanks.
WalterJr.get off my computer now!
I told you not to touch my things!
get out right now, before I throw you out! - mom!
you have five seconds! Five, four, three-- - mom!
growing up is hard.
but sometimes, making peace with the people in your life s even harder.
and for me, it was a long journey.
I made a lot of mistakes.
Hey, what is that?
what is this is scratch tight.
I'm sorry, sir, but that was there when you brought it in.
it took a lot of little steps,
but there was one tiny stutter, one false move...
and I came crashing back to earth.
Lindsey's out of town, so, um...
I thought we'd work here.
you guys can come in if you like.
I always imagined what it would look like,
but now to finally see it, it's like...
so, uh, do we have carte blanche?
full access.
know what it means.
you know, like at Lindsey's, Walter can make a sandwich,
Tyler can leave the toilet seat up.
that's him.
need a plant.
there's no grub.
this corkboard's weird.
okay, soon as you guys are done investigating my apartment,
maybe we should take a look at this.
we got a John Doe, mid 20s, fell to his death from the Loman Building on Michigan Avenue about three months ago.
Russell says the P. D haven't gotta tip in a month,
so, uh, she thought maybe we could help.
or it could've been a suicide.
I mean, if that's what the police think,
it might explain why it's not really a priority.
maybe he fell or got pushed?
that's a big building.
and no one saw anything?
Nah, first of all, it happened at night around 2: 00 am.
and second, all the M. E.
knows is that he fell from one of the higher floors.
those have balconies and terraces.
uh, where are the photos?
you don't want to see them.
I, uh, I had Chicago P. D.
crop some of the close-ups.
these are for you.
the, uh, bones in his face were completely destroyed.
good luck.
it's not much to go on, really.
he was wearing a charcoal gray suit from Hugo Boss.
those are real expensive, right?
why are you looking at me?
he was also wearing these.
that's an interesting choice.
why with the suit?
I mean, was he trying to be hip?
or he had a job where he had to dress nice,
but you only see him from the waist up.
like, uh, he's a news anchor.
you know what?
I have a lot of good ideas a lot of--most of the time.
sometimes.
well, maybe they're, uh, some kind of specialty shoes, and we'll get lucky.
now this is for you.
is that fish?
not fish--snake.
snake scales.
they were embedded in his clothing.
wow, he really was an anchorman.
we know any, uh, snake experts from the network?
we need more specifics.
all right, I'll try and find one.
if not, I will become one.
can we get some food?
Yeah, in the kitchen. Top right-hand drawer.
they're in a binder-- takeout menus.
you keep your takeout menus in a binder?
is that weird?
you need a plant.
so when did Tyler say that the sketch would be ready?
uh, tomorrow.
maybe.
it's not easy.
well, these would be good for you.
those are called "straitjacket."
is that a, uh, shoe you wear in a rubber room?
uh, we're wondering if you sell these.
we went to a couple of mall shops, and they sent us here.
sure.
those are Radii.
we're the exclusive distributor in Chicago.
they're pretty expensive.
we don't sell very many.
uh, do you remember a guy coming in here?
about, uh, 6 feet tall, sort of brownish hair
a few months ago?
do you have a picture of him?
not yet.
he might have been wearing a business suit.
Oh, yeah.
I remember that guy.
he had these outrageous moves.
when I was a kid, having the hottest kicks was the most important thing in the world.
and now they reminded me of the kid I used to be...
and the ones I wanted to help.
do you remember if he said where he worked, or, uh, why he was dressed so nicely?
these Radii-- what kind of people wear them?
what are they for?
fashion, skating.
some people just collect them and never wear them at all.
what about that guy?
I don't know.
he's in here every couple of weeks.
not the nicest guy in the world.
excuse me.
um, those shoes you're wearing-- they're pretty cool.
do you know anybody else who might wear a similar type?
maybe multicolored, like these?
we just want to talk.
Yeah, he jumped onto a fire escape?
from one fire escape to another fire escape
in, like, three seconds.
he flew! - Bouncing off walls.
just bing, bong, bing.
it was crazy!
you want me to arrest him or get his autograph?
we went back to the clerk.
he goes by the name "Gekko." Picks up new shoes twice a month.
Yeah, pricey shoes.
you think this guy's trouble?
or he's in cirque du soleil.
I'll run his name, but unless someone can track him down,
there's not much we can do.
please, please, please, please.
I just--could I speak to somebody from missing persons?
or, uh, just a detective of someone
I've come a long ways for this.
uh, can I help you?
Oh, yes, thank you.
uh, this was posted by a group called the forgotten network,
but I thought I should come to the police instead.
my name's Bill Ramey.
I think these belong to my son.
his name was Benjamin Ramey.
he was 13.
benjy was taken from my front yard ten years ago up in Evanston.
I live in Colorado now, but I've never stopped looking for him.
he'd be 23, graduated from college, working his first job.
you see, he's--he'-he's grow up in my mind.
um, and he likes Chicago.
Mr. Ramey, I'm incredibly sorry for what happened to you,
but, uh, we haven't even posted a sketch yet.
can you prove any of this?
these shoes.
benjy collected them, uh, even when he was a kid.
if they were rare or one of a kind, he just had to have them.
and he kept all these mixed up colors.
and the hair and the eye color match Benjy's, too.
look at-- I know this sounds crazy, but when I saw this posting.
I just knew.
a few years ago, I had an artist do an age progression.
that's Benjamin. That's my son.
and I believe that's the boy that you found.
and I'd like to see him.
he could be right about our Doe.
eh, I don't know.
I mean, there's no identifying marks.
there's no photo been released of our victim yet.
here's the missing persons report.
his son did disappear.
so he was telling the truth.
I just got Tyler's e-mail.
Hey, it's me.
you tell him to fax it over with the contract by 3: 00,
or the deal is off.
ye yeah, I know he said 6: 00, but he's a lawyer...
he says a lot of things.
wait, wait, Cathy...
let me call you back.
park who?
parkour.
l'art du dlacement. - which in English means...
it's like... Avoiding every obstacle.
which in English means...
What--what is it?
a sport? Are they competing?
they have competitions, but it's more like a state of mind...
or movement.
so I'm here...
and I need to go over there, right?
now most people would just go around, but in parkour, you go up...
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
and over.
what's the point?
uh, you know, parkour gives you a sense of accomplishment,
like nothing can slow you down.
so maybe our guy was park-ing off a building and he fell off.
Parkour-ing.
and in a business suit?
well, we're gonna have to find some of the real dudes who do this.
if our Doe had the parkour sneakers, he might've been a thrill seeker.
and someone in that world knew him and what happened to him.
uh, may I help you?
Yeah, the police sent me.
who are you people?
who are you?
and this is Simon...
my brother.
this was taken three years ago.
a few months later, he just walked out of our lives.
my family did everything we could to try and find him.
I had the street smarts, big mouth.
but Simon--he had the brains.
just, he was a little lost.
well, u're one of the top executives
for the biggest real estate developer in the city.
you seem to have done pretty well.
that didn't make it any easy on my brother.
he was already hard on himself anyway.
my mother and stepfather wanted him to be just like me,
and he wanted something else.
did that upset him or depress him at all?
he didn't jump off that building, detective.
he was a kid.
you know, he wanted to get a job, figure it out, go to college later.
we all grow up at different times.
I mean, I had a rolodex in sixth grade,
Simon--he had a skateboard like most kids.
was he involved with something called parkour?
the jumping thing.
he was great at it.
ever since he was a kid, he used to climb all over everything.
he wasn't bad.
he was just...
trying to find his way.
I just wanted him to be happy.
Mr. Ramey.
I-I'm ready to take Benjamin's body.
Mr. Ramey, we talked about this.
wait. Who are you?
I'm Benjamin's father.
Simon is my brother.
what is he talking about?
we're ordering D.N.A. Tests.
I've already done that.
Mr. Ramey, I know that.
I sent your swab in yesterday, we'll do Miss Denver's right now. And when the tests come back, we'll have our answers.
two and a half years ago-- When Simon Denver disappeared.
when will both D. N.A. Tests be back?
Thanks. Uh, in a couple of days.
um, Russell put them in as a rush.
you know, Maxine knew about parkour-- Not just the sneakers.
Yeah, but Ramey's sketch is closer than her photo.
snake update.
here's a tipster.
uh, works in an animal hospital over in Highland Park.
says she thinks it's a king a bra scale.
that is just weird.
John Doe is carrying around a live, poisonous snake?
right now our best leads are John Doe's signature sneakers.
and we need to find out where they do this parkour thing.
well, the problem with parkour is that the "where" can be anywhere.
Russell hasn't had any luck tracking down this Gekko character.
maybe some of the other people who buy at that shoe store know him or can lead us to our Doe.
his name might have been Benjamin or Simon?
his name was Bigman.
he was a little before my time.
he used to hang out around here and some of the downtown parks a few years ago, then he was gone...
till about three or four months ago.
he looked different, like a lawyer.
but he stuck around, gave some tips to the new kids.
you do it wrong, you get hurt.
if I could teach someone how to avoid my mistakes,
I was gonna do it.
if it is not just on a jump how to or--or landing, but in life.
parkour is totally nonviolent, nonconfrontational.
we build each other.
Bigman got that.
what about this guy?
is he nonviolent, nonconfrontational?
he's bad news.
you know his real name?
no idea.
any idea where he hangs out?
people say he put a crew together and they're practicing
in one of those old abandoned buildings near Bucktown.
what kind of crew?
Gekko's little gang of thieves.
excuse me, sir.
has anyone asked you about the man who fell out of the building?
the police were here a few months ago.
it was messy and traumatic and exciting,
and we don't like to talk about it.
well, the police didn't have a sketch, did they?
Oh, yeah.
I remember him.
he was a hot, cute weirdo.
a hot, cute weirdo.
I saw him right over there,
just leaning against the wall outside the coffee shop,
couple of times.
he just kept staring at it.
at what? - The building.
I was sizing it up because everything I needed was right inside.
his gaze was fierce.
and by "fierce," I mean determined, not "girl," work it out.
then this other guy came up to him, and started arguing with him.
this guy?
Yep.
dark and intense like a cheetah.
no idea what they were talking about, but it was not friendly.
honestly, I thought they were about to have a hot, cute, fierce, weird cheetah fight.
we think he had some kind of illegal animal on him when he died.
I'm the property manager, that's right.
are there any companies with offices in the building
that would specialize in that sort of thing?
maybe import/export kind of stuff?
retail's all on the street level.
you've seen it--bank, two restaurants, cell phones...
I can get you a list of all the businesses top to bottom. That help?
that'd be great, thanks.
we're sick about what happened here.
some people outside saw him a few days before he died.
sounds like he was casing the building.
and they saw Gekko with him, too.
together? - Yeah.
but they might have been arguing.
gekko was into some bad stuff.
and we still don't know what was going on between him and John Doe.
I'm gonna give Russell a call.
I think she should start looking for this Gekko character a little harder.
Hey, what are you doing here?
wanted to see where my brother died.
cool with that?
I'm sorry.
I'm just--I'm a bit- Listen, I get it.
uh, this is Tyler, Maxine. - What's up?
Hi.
what are you guys doing here?
we're still investigating the John Doe case.
you mean my brother.
right.
uh, before he disappeared, is it possible that he was involved In some kind of illegal animal smuggling operation?
are you kidding?
I-I don't understand.
you guys aren't cops.
we work with the police.
that's fine, but I'm not answering any more of your questions.
look, we're just trying to help you.
see, that's the thing.
I don't really understand why.
because the police solve crimes.
they want to know who did it.
we speak for the victims.
we identify, so their loved ones can find out, too.
so many people out there waiting, Maxine-- People just like you.
bill Ramey's here.
uh, well, I'm with, uh, Maxine Denver right now.
meet me at the precinct, both of you.
the D. N.A. results are in.
is he nodding, "that's my son." I understand.
"thank you for telling me"? Or "it's not my son."
he's still out there and I have to keep looking"?
Maxine-- I just--I don't want to be right.
I'm not saying I want him to be right, either.
just try to take a deep breath. Okay?
it's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry for your loss.
miss Denver, uh...
my condolences.
thank you.
wow, this is hard.
I...I gotta go see my mother and stepfather.
of course. Of course.
Chicago P. D. will need to speak with them as well, as soon as it's convenient.
I-I can come with you if you want.
no. I-I appreciate your help...
but I think I'd like the police to take it from here.
I'll bring my parents by this afternoon.
thank you.
it's hard for a mother to say this,
but I-I-I think I knew this day would come.
we never knew how to get through to him, and then...
he--he just...
turned his back on us.
he didn't turn his back on you.
Really?
he disappeared over two and a half years ago
no phone call, no e-mail, nothing.
if that's not turning your back, what it?
and it wasn't just us, Maxine.
he shut you out, too.
Simon always had a hard time fitting in.
all he cared about was that parkour stuff.
ever since he was a kid, he-- he climbed all over everything.
it was fine as a hobby,
but I tried to explain to him that he needed a real plan.
a month--a month before we lost contact with him,
Simon was arrested.
he--he broke into a high-rise downtown
the Loman Building the one he died at.
wait. You didn't tell me this.
you were working on the stadium project,
the big promotion, and--and we didn't want to distract you.
I could've talked to him.
I knew the developer of the building.
Simon hadn't actually stolen anything,
so we got him to drop the charges.
but we asked him to leave the house after that.
it was just a stunt.
it was stupid, and I know that now.
they kept telling me to grow up, but I didn't know how.
the only way I could find myself was to run.
we just never thought he'd leave us altogether.
did he have any, uh, personal disputes?
did he owe anyone money?
I lent him money. $2, 000.
he needed it, and I gave it.
I guess it just wasn't enough.
according to Russell,
Simon had a huge fling out with his parents.
she's a pediatrician, and the stepdad's an architect.
well, Maxine's got it all together, too.
must have been a ton of pressure.
well, our Doe's got his name, he's back with his parents.
but if this does become a murder investigation,
we need to take our cues from Russell.
brownstones on the block have depreciated by 30% over the last five years.
do you know you're underwater on this place?
I do now.
so this is the office.
uh, office apartment, storage facility, for takeout menus.
this is Walter Bailey, Candace Butler.
we work together. They're part of the network.
you work for free?
whoa, we don't get paid for this?
I'm sorry about your brother.
thank you.
honestly, I'm not sure anymore who he was.
but the police are calling it a suicide or an accident.
either way, closed case.
you don't buy it?
my brother loved life, and he was too good at parkour
and not nearly stupid enough to fall off a building.
he wasn't a criminal, either.
someone did this to him.
who's this guy?
we think, uh, he was friends with Simon.
and they were seen arguing outside the Loman Building shortly before Simon's death.
he does the parkour thing as well,
but from what we understand, he doesn't use it for self-empowerment.
he might know what your brother was up to in Chicago.
why haven't the police questioned him?
he might have hurt my brother.
well, they would if they could find him.
how did you guys find him?
in the urban Kicks shoe store.
he wears the same kind of custom shoes as Simon.
well, let's track him down. Let's follow him.
you must have a high-tech super van or something.
I wish.
the salesgirl told us he just ordered a pair of shoes,
so we know he'll be back.
if you can track a car, maybe you can track a shoe.
I'll place the transmitter right here.
Yeah, I'd push that further.
you wanna wear them out?
he's transmitting.
he's, uh, he's stopped.
he's gone inside.
77 Dalton.
that's an old theater.
he's up there.
come on! Come on!
Seth Draper, a.k.a .Gekko.
you're a tough man to catch up with.
unfortunately for you, when we caught up with you,
we also caught up with about 20 stolen flat screen televisions as well.
I had nothing to do with that.
what is this about?
this is about you and Simon Denver.
I didn't kill him.
I just saw him a couple times when he got back.
got back from where?
got back from where?
wherever the hell he's been the past couple years before that.
I was with him when he got busted on b&e at the Loman Building, way back when.
after his stepdad bailed him out,
he said he was leaving Chicago to go see the world.
well, where did he go? Who was he with?
I wasn't with him, lady.
like I said, I only saw him a few months ago.
he was different-- The suit, the short hair.
complete sellout mode.
but that was all an act.
how do you know?
cause I followed him.
he was staking out the Loman and some other buildings, too.
I wanted in on it, but he said he was doing this on his own.
planning for "something big." that's all he would say.
which other building?
the new loft building on Wacker
you know, the one with the 2-inch window ledge and the copper gutters.
that's my building.
something big.
we canvassed the park right across from your loft.
people saw him there, too.
we now have proof that Gekko's a thief.
and we know that your brother did run with him for a while,
even if they'd never robbed anybody together.
no disrespect, but he could've been planning to rob the Loman or even your building.
right. In a suit?
it was an expensive suit.
he had to get the money from someplace.
an expensive suit 80 people remember him wearing doesn't seem like the smart choice.
my brother was afraid of almost nothing.
if he wasn't going into that building or mine...
something was making him nervous.
maybe he was gonna climb the Loman,
or do some other big stunt and die trying.
what is all this "cobra" stuff?
your brother was found with baby king cobra scales on his body.
snake wine. Look it up.
Yes, ma'am.
snake wine.
whole snakes steeped or infused in rice wine or grain alcohol.
found in China and parts of Southeast Asia.
my father and my mother divorced when we were little.
but my father served in Vietnam.
he went back after the war ended
and he brought back bottles of snake wine.
it says here that it's an elixir.
it can heal all wounds.
Simon and me broke them at the house by accident one time when we were playing.
so you aren't perfect.
I think you're perfect.
I think my baby brother really did see the world.
maybe he was in China or Southeast Asia.
maybe he brought it back as a replacement.
he'd been back about a month before he died.
why would he still be lugging it around?
maybe he was planning to give them to somebody. I don't know.
uh, okay, great.
we'll be there first thing in the morning.
Russell says she just found, uh, Simon's apartment.
snake wine.
this one plus the one that was on him.
one for his sister, one for his mother.
he had a bunch of brochures and papers from Lincoln City Bank.
let me guess. They have an office in the Loman Building.
first floor.
but he didn't have maps or floor plans
small business loan applications.
he wasn't gonna rob it.
he wanted to borrow money.
in the same building that he broke into three years ago.
something big.
I couldn't wait for her to see it
a job, a plan, a place of my own.
I'd let her down before.
she never said it, but I felt it.
he was all grown up.
I couldn't face her or talk to her, not just yet.
she always believed in what I could do.
it took me a lot longer to believe in myself.
travel journals.
he loved to write.
what's this?
Oh, it's a book contract...
with a cash advance.
at least we know--we know where he got the money for those nice suits and expensive sneakers.
we found a photo sharing account, but we haven't located a password.
"Harrison." Our--our father's first name.
he passed away ten years ago.
I started on the West Coast-- Portland, San Francisco
but it wasn't enough.
bangkok, Paris, Sydney, Australia.
I got my passport stamped 20 times.
parkour was my ticket around the world.
it paid my way and more.
I haven't been to any of these places.
but I also learned how lucky I was.
and the same skill that empowered me,
I could use it to help other people, too.
he did amazing things.
no, wait.
go back. The, uh, the last one.
that's Bill Ramey.
bill Ramey checked out of his hotel early this morning.
he's flying to Colorado.
I'm sorry I ever believed him.
we have uniforms at the airport looking for him
and we're checking flight manifests right now.
this just also came in.
we, uh, spoke to his supervisor.
apparently he stopped working there months ago,
placed on mental health leave after threatening a coworker.
what, and you didn't check this before?
we had no reason to.
this guy Ramey is a conman.
he lied to your face.
I knew there was something off about him.
but his son was abducted.
I mean, that part of the story is true.
I mean, maybe, uh, his pain and anger turned into violence.
what? Why are you defending him?
I'm not defending him.
I'm trying to understand him.
well, for all you know, he killed his son and my brother.
you need to find him.
we're doing everything we can, Maxine, okay?
we have a patrol car parked outside your parents' house in case he shows up.
we should talk to them because if Ramey did kill her brother...
let's go.
we think Ramey knew it wasn't his son the whole time,
and we're trying to figure out why.
that's kind of sick, isn't it?
maybe he wanted to be part of someone else's family instead of ours.
stop it. - Maxine.
he didn't want to be in another family.
Simon went all over the world on his own for two years.
he came back to Chicago a month before he died.
he changed.
he did get an apartment, Mrs. Denver.
and, uh, it looks like he'd signed a book deal.
a book deal?
Yeah.
pictures and essays from his trip.
two days before he died, he had a meeting with the Lincoln City Bank.
I called them.
you called them?
he was applying for an urban redevelopment loan.
he said he was gonna combine that with the book advance
to start an afterschool program for at-risk kids.
Simon thought he had to find his own way.
then he did.
we found Ramey.
I was in, uh, Paris two summers ago with my wife on vacation,
and there were these kids in front of the Eiffel Tower,
and they were performing all of these tricks.
parkour.
Yes, that's right. And he was with them.
there was some kind of a competition going on.
I didn't tell my wife about it at the time 'cause she wouldn't let me do it anymore.
do what?
hope.
so I went back...
uh, later by myself.
and we started talking, and he said that, uh, he was from Chicago.
and he--he was very vague about his family, said he didn't have one anymore.
did you tell him your suspicions?
no. But we did-- we became friends.
and I followed his travels, and, uh,
he e-mailed me when he got back to Chicago a few months ago,
and I went up to see him and I...
then I was-- I was gonna tell him the truth about who I thought he was.
but you didn't.
no. We met for dinner, and I couldn't
I just couldn't figure out what to say.
maybe deep down, I just didn't want to find out that I was wrong.
after, at, I tried to contact him and I didn't hear back.
and then I saw the--the posting on the network, and I recognized the shoes...
and I just know it was him.
and you waited three months to claim him?
well, I...
I thought somebody else would.
look, I'm sorry.
I should've come forward sooner, but - You told him the truth, he rejected you, and you were angry enough to kill him.
that's not what happened.
we have credit card records putting you in an airport hotel on November 15th.
Simon fell from the Loman Building early the next morning.
are we gonna find witnesses that saw you arguing with him?
I didn't kill him, detective.
I thought he was my son.
until you found out he wasn't.
I mean, did you really just go to dinner, say nothing and then just...
let it go?
okay, after dinner, I followed him.
I had to say something.
I-I had to--I had to find out.
what time was this?
9: 00, 10: 00 maybe.
well, where did he go?
up to, uh, Evanston.
uh, there was this house with an iron gate and ivy all around it.
it was somebody's home. I don't know whose it was.
but that's the last time I saw him.
I swear.
that's our house.
Simon went home.
and a few hours later, he dies in a building downtown.
so either he's lying...
or someone in your house saw your brother alive.
there has been burglery in this neighborhood so we changed the security code after Simon left. There's no way he would've been able to get in without calling ahead.
considering Simon's skills and the height of this gate,
I don't think he needed much help.
maybe you should stay here.
I'll hang with you.
we know he came to the house the night before he died.
what are you talking about?
bill Ramey followed him here.
that's ridiculous. You believe the lunatic?
so you're standing by your story
that you haven't seen your son in two and a half years?
it's not a story. It's the truth.
and if the police dust the top of that fence for fingerprints or the windowpanes, they won't find any that belong to Simon?
he used to live here. Of course they will.
on the outside?
how about blood upstairs or, uh, forensic evidence in this room?
look, we know you have connections with the Loman Building.
you used them to bail him out when he was busted.
What'd you do to him that night?
I want you two to leave.
he was here, wasn't he?
but she wasn't.
Maxine told me that your wife was in the city,
went to the symphony with her daughter,
stayed in her apartment overnight.
Simon was here, and so were you.
Sam, what's happening?
nothing.
I'm calling my lawyer. - Fine.
they can meet us downtown.
they wanted me to change.
they wanted me to grow up and become a man.
maybe I changed too much.
it was Saturday night.
my parents always went out on Saturday night.
I wanted them to come home, flip on the light and see my face
their wayward son returned.
they never made things easy, but I didn't wanna wait another moment.
I wanted to present them with a complete person,
so someone they could be proud of have as a member of the family.
I wanted it to be a surprise.
and it was...
for both of us.
it was an accident.
they why didn't you call the police?
I panicked.
my wife never would've forgiven me.
but I had to get rid of the evidence.
you mean the body?
so then you call your friend at the Loman?
Simon had a guest pass from the building in his pocket,
and he'd broken in there before.
I never thought they'd recognize him. And if they did, after all the stunts he'd pulled,
They'd--they'd just think he pulled another.
same old Simon. That's what you were counting on, huh?
but he wasn't the same.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone, detective.
I wanted him to succeed as much as anyone.
but when he showed up in my house...
in the dark?
he wasn't my son.
I left my family a boy and came back a man.
I did all the right things.
I took all the right steps.
I wanted to be worthy.
and I hope, in the end, they'll believe that I was.
my name is Simon Denver.
Hello?
Hey, I'm headed back to the office.
I've been, ooh, n-neglectful.
7, 000 e-mails or something.
Hey, you've, uh, you've had a valid excuse.
how do you balance all of this with your real job?
by not having one.
Where's the team?
well, they're out there somewhere living their lives.
are they a team?
they're just people.
maybe a little weird, but just people.
right.
well, I finished Simon's paperwork for the youth project.
I'm donating all the money to setting it up.
that's fantastic.
my brother came back to Chicago, Alex.
he stood in front of the place that I live,
and he could've called my name out any day of the week,
and I would've heard it.
I could've spent the rest of my life wondering why he didn't reach out.
but because of all of this, all of you, I understand my brother.
I know why he wanted to wait, and I know how much he loved me.
I'm--I'm glad that we could help.
maybe I could, uh, help, too.
what do I need to do?
well, you just, uh, show up.
see you around.
Hey, mom.
Yeah, I can't really talk right now. I'm pretty busy at work.
Candace, you ready, or what?
Yeah, be right there. Uh, look, I gotta go. I'm sorry.
a flood seminar is about to start.
you don't look like a waitress.
I'll take that as a compliment.
let me guess... You're trying to find yourself?
I quit my job. Lost my passion for insurance.
I get it. I was a lawyer for two years... Hated it.
you know, bar business is way more interesting.
last year, we found a dead body in the bathroom.
you don't get that kind of excitement at a law firm.
someone died here?
Yeah, she was, like, 40.
and they think it was murder, too, but the cops still haven't figured out who she was.
I finished your mayo.
I have mayo?
Hey, where's Lindsey?
uh, she's on a field trip. She'll join us later.
so after today, we'll be moving back to her house, right?
Yeah, actually I figure since we're starting here, we might as well see the case all the way through.
Um,"all the way through"?
Yeah, so, uh, grab some snacks... and a housekeeper.
how'd you find out about this case?
uh, I know a waiter at the bar where they found the body.
so our Doe is a white female, 40, blunt force trauma to the head.
her body was found in the bathroom of a local hangout...
a place called the X Bar... About a year ago.
12 months and 2 days, to be exact.
the X Bar?
they find anything at the scene?
Yeah, chewing gum, tissue and a pair of orange glasses.
she was dressed conservatively.
there was also a faded ultraviolet club stamp on her hand, but it's not from the X Bar.
why was our not-so-young doe hanging out in a bar filled with twenty somethings?
maybe she liked young guys. - Or young girls.
sorry for being open-minded.
okay, well, let's start with the orange glasses and the, uh, faded stamp.
Walter, don't you have an uncle who's an optometrist?
uncle Ray. He's the best.
great. So stop by the precinct, collect the evidence.
and you... It's your lucky day.
you actually get to recreate something that's not a face.
sorry I'm late.
Maxine, you found us. How are you?
I, um, I got a copy of the file for you.
Oh, right. The woman at the X Bar.
bet Candace is all over this one.
why do you say that?
well, she works there, right?
uh, the X Bar?
Candace... She, uh, sells insurance or something.
Oh, that's weird. I take clients there sometimes.
there's one waitress that is just like her.
but I actually came to tell you that I can't really stay.
my mom and I... We're still dealing with closing up Simon's apartment.
of course.- But I-I really want to help, so...
I just need some more time.
cool?
cool. You, uh, could've just called.
eh, I'm a face-to-face kind of girl.
but keep me posted, okay?
got it.
and don't screw it up.
looks like a flame.
I say we start at the bar where the Doe was found.
odds are, the stamp is from the same place in the neighborhood.
uh, I can't.
doctor's appointment.
everything okay? - Yeah, dermatologist.
but call me if you find anything interesting.
I used to love going out on the town, but this wasn't about drinking at the bar or dancing all night.
I was on a different mission.
uh, sorry. Don't recognize it.
but, uh, Tommy might.
he's been in this business since he was about 5.
Tommy, you got a sec?
you know where this is from?
Yeah, it's from a strip club called Apex.
I worked there a few years back.
Thanks.
so our Doe was at a strip club?
Candace said to call if we found anything interesting.
all right. I'm going to, uh, talk to the waitresses and the bartenders.
you start dealing with the girls who are working their way through med school.
uh, what are you doing?
there's only one way we're gonna get these women to talk, and it has nothing to do with compassion.
Really? That's the story you're going with?
are you sure you've never seen her before?
positive.
I already paid you.
for the record, I didn't enjoy it.
for the record, you're lying.
for the record, I enjoyed you not enjoying it much more than I actually enjoyed it.
you two... Let's go. You're asking too many questions.
looking for a fight, tough guy?
Alex? How you doing, brother?
doing good. How about you? You staying out of trouble?
for the most part. Yeah?- These two do-gooders with you?
I'm trying to, uh, I.D. a Jane Doe.
wish I could help.
but we know she was here. She had a stamp on her hand from your club.
we're not the only club that uses that stamp.
what do you mean?
people who own this place... JTG... Have other clubs.
the flame's part of the company logo.
they use different colors, designs, but they all have the flame thing going on.
I'll print out a list for you.
great.
we got a list of venues owned by JTG.
and a list of events held at those venues near the time of the death.
great.
Hey, how'd everything go at the museum of science?
it was good until we started dissecting cow eyeballs and Amy Harper threw up on my shoe.
all right, Walter. Where are we at on these orange glasses?
uh, they're fake... Nonprescription.
they're just cheap fashion glasses.
maybe they're a gimmick... Part of a costume or something.
well, I can try to track down the manufacturer.
I tried that, but all I could find was a logo that says "bt" on them, and there's no companies with those initials.
you know, some of my students wear those glasses... Orange, round frame.
what kind of students? Boys, girls, geeks, jocks?
hip-hop crowd.
maybe some rapper made them popular.
Walter, you're an expert on urban culture. What can you tell us?
um... Well, there's an O. G. Named "Orange Deuce.
O. G.?
Wow. He really went there.
Yeah. Says he's as famous for his crude lyrics as he is for his signature orange glasses.
big time records is his label.
big time records... Bt.
that's gotta be what the logo stands for.
and guess who threw their holiday party at disciple last year on November 30th?
two days before Jane Doe's death.
God, I love it when it all comes together like this, you know?
it's like a... A coming together.
we got your name from the manager of disciple.
he said that you were the event planner for the big time records party last year.
I was. What can I do for you?
do you recognize this woman?
I do. She paid the doorman 1, 000 bucks to crash the party, but things didn't work out too well for her.
she got kicked out after about 15 minutes.
Why? What happened?
she slapped Terrence King in the face.
Terrence King... The... The basketball player?
Mr. Fountain?
I have to get back to work. Sorry.
why would Jane Doe pay 1, 000 bucks to get into an a-list party and then smack Terrence King across the face?
I have no idea, but you gotta love her.
takes a certain kind of woman to smack a superstar.
can I help you with something?
don't you worry about Terrence King or the bitch that slapped him in the face!
why didn't you call Russell?
and have them do what? Take a report and scare off our biggest lead?
forget it. We need to figure out why Jane Doe slapped King in the face.
how did those two even know each other?
maybe they were having an affair.
doubt it.
king's last three girlfriends were 19-year-old Brazilian supermodels.
with all due respect, our Doe didn't exactly match that description.
ageist.
realist.
maybe she's King's drug dealer.
he got busted for cocaine possession last year.
anything's possible, which is why we need to talk to the "fabulous people"
and find out exactly what happened at the party.
Russell put together a list of all the guests.
shouldn't we talk to King directly?
I called the publicist. She declined my request, shockingly.
so why don't we try a sneak attack?
I was listening to sports radio yesterday.
king just wrote a memoir.
the book signing? It's today.
I'll go.
public place, lots of people. What's all the worry about?
well, for starters, he's a punk with a lot of large punk friends.
well, it didn't seem to bother Jane Doe.
and she's sort of dead now.
look, I'll be fine.
I'll use my feminine guile.
he won't see it coming.
Yeah, he's so unaccustomed to women hitting on him.
you'll totally catch him off guard.
you sure you're up for this? - Positive.
look, I can pull this off. Don't worry.
I bet.
fine, but Tyler's gonna go with you.
be careful.
keep working hard, little man.
understand? No limits.
and who do I make this out to?
you're the prettiest damn Mike I ever met.
it's for my father. Big fan.
I'm a big fan, too.
you got plans after this?
glad you stopped by.
me, too.
I, uh, actually have lots of questions to ask.
what kind of questions you got for me, baby? About my beard?
the kind that deal with the big time records holiday party about a year ago.
excuse me?
she was killed a few days after the party.
I'm not a cop. I'm a volunteer, and I'm just trying to...
call my lawyer. - She slapped you in the face that night. Why?
look, babe... - Was she your girlfriend?
girlfriend? Are you kidding?
she was just some old-ass white chick yelling at the deejay.
I was looking for answers.
no one was gonna stand in my way, not even a cocky, bearded superstar.
besides, I hated basketball.
what about the deejay?
done talking to you.
did you say, uh, Thai or Italian?
which one's more expensive?
it's really inspirational, man.
it's like a pink collection of bones.
okay, that's even better.
did you get the name of the deejay?
no.
I called Fountain again.
but if he doesn't call me back, I'm gonna go to his office again and I'm gonna make him talk to me.
excellent. Determination.
uh, Lindsey and I are also determined.
do tell. - Yeah, we met an assistant named Jasmine.
she works for one of those sex-tape celebutantes.
and she was the only one on the guest list who would speak with us.
she remember anything?
Yeah. Apparently, Jane Doe was frantically trying to get inside.
why was she so desperate to get into this damn party?
jasmine said she told her it was a family matter.
so Jane Doe pays 1, 000 bucks to get into the hottest party in town because of a family matter.
she gets in there 15 minutes, she has an argument with the deejay and slaps Terrence King across the face.
maybe she's our Doe's daughter or sister.
I mean, it explains why she'd care so much.
well, we know they were fighting.
maybe they didn't make up.
and then there's Terrence King.
is he just an innocent bystander or is he involved with the deejay or the Doe?
well, king's a lot of things, but innocent bystander aren't one of them.
is he an O. G? - At this point, his O. G status is uncertain.
I think it's time that Russell had a chat with Terrence King.
kind of odd, don't you think?
woman slaps you in the face and a few days later, she turns up dead?
are you suggesting there's a correlation between some wacko woman assaulting my client and her homicide?
we're just looking for answers.
but if you prefer, we could subpoena your client and have him testify in front of a grand jury.
before he says anything, I want assurances you'll keep his name out of this.
he's in the middle of a $100 million contract negotiation.
we don't want his name thrown around in connection with some murder investigation.
is that why your pal paid Mr. Donovan a visit the other night?
we have a deal or what?
Yes. Assuming your client's innocent, and the face-slap was just a stupid coincidence.
I am and it was.
good. So let's chat.
what was the nature of your relationship with the deejay?
I met her that night.
what does she look like?
around 20, white, cute.
what was the argument about?
it was just some crazy chick talking to the deejay, telling her to think things over, call her at the hotel the next day.
do you remember the name of the hotel?
was it the Finmore... The Finmore Hotel?
Yeah. Yeah, that was it.
anything else?
how about dinner tonight?
why are you here again?
well, I asked Alex if I could come instead.
you know, sometimes you just want to get out in the field, stretch those legs like a gazelle?
you know, he really should have called me first.
sorry for the wait.
about your Jane Doe... I'm not authorized to give out personal information.
I'll have to check with my manager.
well, why don't you go do that?
Thanks.
um, by any chance, have you seen this woman?
she was here about a year ago.
Yeah, I remember her.
she was crying, so we started talking.
did you get a name?
no. But we chatted for ten minutes.
she was really worried about her daughter.
she has a daughter? - Yeah.
do you remember anything else?
Yeah.
after the talk, she gave me a $20.
I was offended.
I told her I was just listening.
look, um... Any way you can dig into the computer and get me a name?
it's really important.
Thanks, man.
think I can get 10 bucks back?
no, u may not.
I think our Doe's name is Wendy Scott.
last known address... Bloomington, Indiana.
how did you... - Feel like taking a ride?
Yeah, with Alex.
Walter, good job, by the way.
do you have a daughter named Wendy?
Yes.
Why?
do you mind if we come inside?
I'm sorry to have to show you this photo, but is this Wendy?
she was killed in, uh, Chicago one year ago.
we're also trying to locate Wendy's daughter.
so if you can tell us where she might be?
her daughter?
right.
Wendy didn't have a daughter.
Wendy didn't have any children?
no, not that I know of, but... - But what?
she'd been going to this fertility clinic in Chicago, trying to get pregnant.
was she successful?
don't know.
we... We stopped talking about 18 months ago.
how come?
we had a falling out.
she was single. She worked 60 hours a week.
I just thought it was selfish for her to raise a child on her own with no father.
does that make me a bad person?
I always assumed I'd get married and have children, but that's not what happened.
I spent too much time building a career and dating ambivalent men.
before I knew it, I was 40 and single.
I had to find another way to have a child, even if it meant alienating my mother.
um, you, uh, you mentioned her job.
what kind of work did she do?
uh, she had her own business selling retirement plans.
as a matter of fact, her partner was helping her conceive.
do you know his name?
Wendy was amazing... Smart, determined, tough.
we worked together for ten years, and we sold the business about 16 months ago.
Wendy's mother said that, uh, you were trying to help her conceive.
Yeah, I was her sperm donor.
being a parent myself, I was happy to help.
we adopted Jenny three years ago.
best thing I ever done.
what happened with the in vitro?
unfortunately, I wasn't too helpful.
apparently, my sperm don't swim like Michael Phelps.
all right. Did she, uh, find another donor?
she must have.
about a year ago, I saw her buying a crib at baby mart.
was she pregnant?
she wasn't showing, but I assumed she was.
she was all smiles.
putting a crib together...not that easy.
but I was ready for the challenge of being a mother.
I'd been ready for a long time.
did the M. E. call you back?
we talked, but she didn't test for pregnancy in the autopsy.
so if Wendy was pregnant, it was at a very early stage.
can the M. E. check now?
Yeah, but we have to get a court order to exhume the remains.
Oh, great. I'll get right on that.
you hear back from that diva Eric Fountain yet?
Yeah. He only knows the deejay by her stage name.
said he made a check out to "D. J. Sin, llc." Russell's going through the names.
that's so weird.
a hip downtown deejay and a 40-year-old financial products saleswoman.
what is their connection?
I mean, something must have brought them together.
but Wendy's 40, right?
independent, successful, wanted a baby, was having trouble conceiving.
what if the deejay was Wendy's surrogate?
maybe, but downtown deejays don't really make great surrogates.
it's just a theory.
well, even if you're right, I mean, how does that connect with Wendy's murder?
Hey, would you just stop being so negative, will you?
negative?
I'm just stating my... - I'm sorry.
I'm just... Wendy had a lot of courage.
I admire that.
I could use some of that.
nothing.
got a text message from Russell.
D. J. Sin, llc. is registered to a Sarah Poole... 19, lives here in Chicago.
excuse me. Are you Sarah Poole?
Yes.
do you recognize this woman?
of course.
that's Wendy.
how do you know her?
it's okay.
were you her surrogate?
her surrogate?
no.
Wendy wanted to adopt my baby.
this is my brother James.
he works at the fertility clinic where Wendy and I met.
I get why Wendy was at the fertility clinic, but why were you?
when I found out Sarah was pregnant, I asked one of the doctors to check her out, just to make sure everything was okay.
you didn't know Wendy?
no, I met her when she and Sarah began to talk about the adoption.
then what?
uh... I was sitting in the lobby, tripping out over motherhood, school...
and in walks this amazing woman, Wendy.
we started talking, and she told me how badly she wanted to be a mother, that she'd been trying to get pregnant, but the doctors told her she couldn't.
and it was just this beautiful, serendipitous moment.
when my doctors told me I couldn't have a child, I thought my dreams of having a baby were over.
but then I met Sarah, and I realized I was finally going to be a mother.
then what happened?
I changed my mind.
the more time I spent with Wendy, the... the more I realized I wanted to be a mother.
I knew that I could do it and... and that I wanted to do it.
did you tell Wendy that you changed your mind before or after the big time records party?
well...
what is it, Sarah?
I - I was too afraid to tell her myself, so I had the lawyer she hired make the call.
that's why Wendy tracked you down at the party.
after the lawyer called, she wanted to talk to you about you having a change of heart?
Yeah.
I'd been ignoring her phone calls and e-mails.
I thought she was gonna hate me.
but she just... wanted to make sure I was ready to be a mother.
and when I told her I was, she understood and she said... It was the right thing to do.
is the father still in the picture?
Gavin. Yeah. He's at work right now.
we're getting married next month.
so Sarah backs out of the adoption, but Wendy ends up dead.
it doesn't make sense.
she should be the killer, not the victim.
maybe Wendy's death isn't connected to the adoption.
maybe, but everything we've learned about Wendy is related to her wanting be a mother.
she was trying to do something great, so we need to keep digging.
we should start with this.
Russell said she couldn't get to it until tomorrow, so I convinced her to let us take a crack at it.
Walter, it's all yours.
what about the lawyer?
I called, I stopped by the office... Nothing.
what about the baby daddy?
Really?
bet you he's back from work.
go for it.
so, uh, we took this one at, uh... I'm sorry.
you guys didn't come here to look at photos.
sometimes I just get carried away.
it looks like you're settling into the whole father thing.
Yeah, it's, uh, it's pretty awesome.
hard to put it into words, really.
so I assume you weren't thrilled about the adoption.
not really.
it couldn't have been easy sitting on the sidelines like that.
as stressful, real stressful, but, uh, I would have supported Sarah either way.
were you and Sarah still together during all this?
not really.
we took a little break.
like I said, it was a-a pretty tough time for both of us.
how well did you know Wendy?
I only met her once.
she seemed really nice.
there's no doubt that she would have been a great mother.
talk to the lawyer yet?
we had a brief phone conversation, told me he got $2, 000 to do some paperwork.
you don't buy it?
private adoption's a pretty shady business... Lot of backroom deals and under-the-table payoffs.
I looked through Wendy's financial records this morning.
she withdrew $9, 500 on both November 10th and 11th for a total of $19, 000.
the adoption agreement was signed on November 11th.
that's either a coincidence... - Or the lawyer got a $19, 000 cash bonus.
why didn't you tell us about the $19, 000-under-the-table kicker?
did Wendy want the money back when the adoption fell apart?
you knew that Wendy was desperate to have a kid, and you used that against her.
you sold her a bill of goods worth $19, 000.
excuse me?
just tell us the truth.
it'll be easier for you down the road.
all right.
I grew up in group shelters and foster homes, Mr. Donovan.
I know what it's like to be abused and ignored.
my only mission in life is to help children find suitable homes.
so unless you're gonna charge me with a crime, I'm leaving.
and you can both go to hell.
looks like the lawyer really is clean.
15 years in practice, not one complaint.
Plus, he's got an airtight alibi.
great. So now we're back to square one.
maybe not. I just found a pretty interesting e-mail... this is no joke.
stop trying to steal my kid, or I'll kill you.
lovely. Who's the author?
Gavin Boyle, the father.
looks like he wasn't waiting on the sidelines after all.
so Gavin sends a threatening e-mail to Wendy.
the problem is, the second Sarah changes her mind about giving up the baby, his motive to kill Wendy disappears.
are we missing something here?
Gavin said he and Sarah decided to take some time off.
what if he didn't know that she decided to keep the kid?
that would mean he killed Wendy for no good reason.
but is he capable of murder?
according to the e-mail that Walter found, it sure sounds like it.
maybe we should talk to James.
why James?
well, if my own marriage is any indication, brothers won't always like the men their sisters marry.
so if anyone's willing to talk smack about Gavin, it's his future brother-in-law James.
let's go see him in the morning.
don't you have work? - What?
uh, day off.
Gavin's a good dude... Loyal, honest, works hard, loves my sister...
his baby girl. So what is this about?
uh, we're just trying to understand how Wendy died.
I mean, what was he thinking when Sarah was considering giving Wendy her baby?
he was nuts.
I was crazy, too. I mean, we... We both wanted Sarah to keep the baby.
I told her I would get another job, I would babysit, whatever.
did Gavin ever confront Wendy?
Yeah.
once.
it was just after Sarah's prenatal check-up.
Gavin showed up out of the blue and started yelling at her.
it got pretty ugly, too.
he told her that if she didn't stay away from Sarah, he would kill her.
I mean, I don't think he meant it, but...
okay, fine. I-I hated her. So what?
Gavin, it's fine to dislike people, but when you threaten them and they wind up dead a week later, it creates a bit of a problem.
I had nothing to do with that.
but you threatened to kill her twice.
Yeah, like I said, I was upset.
I mean, you'd be pissed off, too, if someone was trying to steal your kid.
ever been to a place called the X Bar?
Yeah, a few times.
were you there last December 2nd? - No.
you're sure? - Positive.
I was in San Francisco visiting a friend.
if you're lying... - My friend's name is Mike Easley.
he lives in a part of town called the Sunset.
and if that's not good enough, call American airlines.
Gavin's alibi's on the money.
we're screwed again.
let Russell worry about that.
we need to retrace Wendy's footsteps while she was in Chicago.
well, according to her bill from the Finmore, she got here on November 3rd, the day she met Sarah at the clinic.
and she was killed two days after the big time records party on December 2nd, so that's 30 days.
you said that Wendy met Sarah at the doctor's office on the 3rd?
correct.
it's not in her calendar.
maybe she forgot to put it down.
no, this is the most detailed calendar I've ever seen.
anyone who marks down "buy coconut water" is bound to mark down a doctor's appointment.
Yeah.
no, but we know she went to the clinic that day, right?
I mean, that's when she met Sarah.
and we also know that she had breakfast across the street from the clinic that morning...
Parkway Diner, 8:45 a. m. $21. 45. Let's take a drive.
where are we going?
you're gonna meet Russell at the fertility clinic.
I'm going to the Parkway Diner.
there was no appointment on November 3rd.
but did she see a doctor that day?
I have no record of that.
her last appointment here was August the 9th.
but we're positive that she was here on November 3rd.
sorry. No record of that.
thank you.
she didn't have an appointment that day.
how did she meet Sarah?
unless she came here and didn't see a doctor.
why would someone come to a doctor's office to hang out in the damn lobby?
sure. She used to come in here quite a bit.
she was trying to have a baby.
you knew her?
we talked a couple of times.
last time she was in, she said the fertility treatments weren't working, - so she was gonna adopt instead, - you sure?
Yeah. She let out this scream of joy.
I walked over to see what was going on.
was she here alone?
no, no. She was with him, James Poole.
he works at the clinic across the street.
good guy.
thank you.
so James told Wendy to go to the clinic that day because he knew Sarah would be there.
which means the "serendipitous meeting" was a sham.
why would James lie about that?
well, he passes himself off as a great family man.
do you really think he wanted Sarah, Gavin or the people in his neighborhood now he was trying to sell his nephew?
maybe he was just trying to help Sarah.
or maybe he was trying to pocket the 19k himself.
remember all the cash Wendy withdrew that day? Where do you think it wound up?
James' pocket.
that was meant to be rhetorical, Walter, but, yes.
we ran James Poole's credit card report.
he's no stranger to the X Bar.
he's there five nights a week.
and what about December 2nd, the night Wendy was killed?
he ran up a $55 tab.
what else do we know about him?
he was arrested last year for some big-money, underground poker game.
he sounds like our guy. We just need to connect the dots.
let's start at the X Bar.
you coming?
Yeah. No, I know him. James.
he's here all the time.
what can you tell us about him?
other than his usual drink order?
nothing. Sorry.
you should talk to him.
I heard he takes bets, lends money... - How do you know that?
I... - It's okay, Candace. I know.
how did you...
Alex Donovan, former detective.
I was just waiting for you to tell me. Why didn't you?
I felt like an idiot.
to quit a good job with no real game plan?
I haven't even told my family yet.
they're gonna freak.
listen, I'm proud of you. I mean, to leave a job that, uh, is no longer making you happy... That takes courage.
even if you have no idea what you're gonna do for the rest of your life?
maybe you're doing that right now.
she says we should talk to the bartender.
got a minute?
like I said, I'm homicide, not vice.
just tell me what you know about James Poole.
off the record?
100%.
he's a degenerate, lying piece of crap. Okay?
he owes more people money than Bernie Madoff.
he owe you money?
not anymore.
I loaned him some cash a while back.
the interest kept building up, but he never had any money to pay it down.
so my partner... Mm, put a little pressure on him.
then one day, out of nowhere, he comes walking in with, like, 15 grand and wipes out his balance.
do you remember what day that was?
it was last year, on Thanksgiving Day.
we need to see James Poole.
he should be back from his break in a little while.
there he is.
let's go!
out of the way!
hands up!
you're under arrest for the murder of Wendy Scott.
you're kidding.
next time you think about killing someone at a bar, use cash, because credit card bills don't lie.
so we know you were at the bar the night Wendy was killed.
we also know she paid you $19, 000.
and your D. N.A. was under her fingernails.
I needed money.
and I knew Wendy was desperate to have a baby, so when Sarah got pregnant...
I thought I could make everybody happy... Wendy, Sarah, me.
Sarah changed her mind.
I understood Sarah's decision to keep her baby.
I was sad, of course, but I understood.
the mother-daughter connection is a powerful thing.
that's why I agreed to pay James in the first place.
like I said, when you want something, someone, so badly, you'll do whatever it takes.
when Sarah backed out, I wanted my money back, but he refused.
I was emotional, but this was business.
I told James if he didn't pay me back, I'd tell his sister about our secret deal.
I just can't believe she's gone.
I knew she was making a mistake.
if I just could have tried harder... To...
if I just... If I just could've convinced her to...
but she was just so damn stubborn.
the truth is, Mrs. Scott, you should be thrilled Wendy didn't listen to you.
it's not easy to ignore... To disappoint your mother.
it takes lots of self-esteem, confidence, courage.
and Wendy had all of that in spades.
you were a terrific mother, and you should be proud of that.
and you should be proud that Wendy died chasing her dreams.
thank you.
thank you.
Hey, mom. It's me. I need to tell you something.
I'll never get a chance to be a mother, but Sarah did, and I like to think that I had something to do with that.
my name is Wendy Scott.
Hey, Sarah's brother James, confessed. Turns out he...
foreclosure?
no. Thank goodness.
what's going on?
Uh...Minnifield prep... My alma mater in Pennsylvania...
they... They were looking for a new head of the science department, and I applied on a lark, and here we are.
nobody called me for a reference.
well, it's a great opportunity.
and besides, the east coast... It's... It's home.
why didn't you tell us?
Oh, I tried, but...
why didn't you tell me?
I was gonna call you when I got to Pennsylvania, but...
look, I hate good-byes.
I'm calling them. - Don't.
they should get a chance to say good-bye.
it's not a good-bye.
we're a network, remember?
you'll always have my help.
right.
just... We won't have your food.
I - I'll keep in touch.
you better.
excited?
wait.
EXPL
bomb can you keep a secret?
because I can.
for years, I kept the biggest secret of all.
but that is about to change.
everything is about to change.
Hey. Thanks for coming down.
it sounds urgent. What's going on?
the bomb squad was called down to check out an ammunition box found by a couple of teenagers.
but instead of an explosive device, they found a skull and a few bones.
based on the M. E.'s preliminary exam, the bones are of a female between the ages of 7 and 9.
estimated time of death three to six years ago.
you think it could be my daughter.
the bones were wrapped in a pink down jacket.
that's what she was wearing the day she was taken.
the jacket's being processed now, and the M. E.'s doing a rush D. N.A. sample of the bones to compare to the D. N.A. Sample we have on file for you.
so did-- did they-- did they find anything else inside the ammo box?
they did, but none of it makes any sense
a rubber band ball, a crossword puzzle,
a Sudoku puzzle and a keychain shaped like a ladybug.
none of these things belonged to Lucy.
look, I know that Chicago P. D.'s gonna want me to stay away from this case
but we both know that you won't.
so I convinced them to just accept your help.
Tyler should call the M. E.
and schedule a time to work on the skull,
and I will get you photocopies of the evidence.
Thanks, Grace.
I worked as fast as I could.
it doesn't mean that it's her.
Yeah, maybe it's just a coincidence that the victim and Lucy look alike.
it wouldn't be the first time my sketch resembled two people.
we-- we don't know anything yet. Let's just focus on the case.
let's just start by retracing her steps.
how? She's 8.
maybe she liked math or, uh, pizza with extra peppers
or the color pink, going to the zoo, naming all the animals...
kids have as rich a life as anyone.
and I'm sure she'll speak to us.
but until she does, what do we do?
we focus on the killer.
we use our clues about him to--to find her.
we find him, then we'll find her name.
Yeah, the ex-cop in me says this guy wanted these bones found.
and risk getting caught?
that's just it. He doesn't think he will get caught.
these bones are several years old.
why leave them out in the open now?
we won't have the answer to that until we learn more about him.
how do we do that? He didn't exactly leave his bio.
Yeah, but he did leave the ammo box And the items inside.
choices he made that could tell us things about him or the victim.
Really? I mean, rubber band ball?
even the disposal site could be a clue. Candace, check out the woods.
okay. I can also check out the ammo box.
Tyler, will you see if you can figure out Where this ladybug keychain is from?
and me and Walt? - Uh, it's Walter.
the puzzles-- they don't look like they're from a newspaper or magazine.
I made two copies.
meet back here tomorrow. - All right.
the guy at the army surplus store said those ammo boxes are a dime a dozen.
and there's no meaningful history to Poplar Woods.
it's just some unincorporated land.
and I've learned that ladybugs can pinch with their mandibles.
but a ladybug key chains? Not at all.
"awesome"? Six letters?
check it out.
okay, "gerf" is not a word.
uh, it's pronounced "jerf."
and I had to improvise in a couple places.
here. I did the whole thing... correctly.
and the Sudoku.
awesome? Six letters?
the Sudoku as these shaded boxes,
but there's too many to be a phone number.
Hey. Look, on the crossword,
the western adjacent are spelling a word.
those are the letters to the left of the black boxes.
"western adjacent"? Did you just make that up?
I did.
uh, it spells a name.
I'll call Alex and Russell.
I used to live in a house.
I loved playing in the yard.
but those days are over now.
I ran Matthew Clarke's name, but he doesn't have any priors.
uh, anything from the lab?
not yet. Sorry.
I should get the results back in a few hours.
can I help you?
Yeah. We're looking for Matthew Clarke.
junior or Senior?
the one whose name we might've found on a crossword puzzle In an ammunition box.
Oh. Junior. That's me. I put it there.
I guess you found the cache.
excuse me?
cache as in "globocache."
should I use smaller words?
do you get beat up a lot?
now what is globocaching?
it's an internet-based scavenger hunt.
caches are boxes.
they're left at G. P.S. coordinates.
so people playing the game can hide and seek.
so any number of people could've had access to that ammo box.
that explains the extra fingerprints we found.
is it possible to track the other players who might've left something else in the cache?
after you find the cache, you can post comments online about it,
like, um, "T. F.T. C."-- "thanks for the cache.
okay, so what you got?
I set up a free user account on the globocaching web site.
"sexy artist 83"?
that was taken.
what exactly do you need to do to set up an account?
not much. You give 'em a name and an e-mail address.
so the killer could've set up a phoney account to hide his identity online?
I went to the cache listing to find the users who made posts after finding the ammo box.
besides Matthew, there were two other posts.
I sent them each a message asking if they saw anything suspicious.
a user named "Mikey mike" put the rubber band ball in.
but he didn't see anything shady.
another user named "Bugzilla" put in the ladybug keychain.
did Bugzilla see anything?
he didn't say, just asked where I hid "the hopper."
whatever that means.
listen, guys, I was thinking.
the game is made up of G. P.S. coordinates, right?
and coordinate are made up of digits. - Like the Sudoku puzzle.
and there are 12 digits highlighted In the Sudoku puzzle.
according to the coordinates in the Sudoku,
we're here.
if the person who made the Sudoku left a cache here,
it might not look like an ammunition box.
according to the web site, caches can look like anything.
Yeah, that helps.
I loved hide-and-seek.
you stand perfectly quiet,
perfectly still.
someone might be right next to you.
they have no idea you're there.
but I've been hiding long enough.
it's not Lucy. It's not your daughter.
well, she's-- she's still somebody's daughter.
did you guys find anything?
our coordinates must be off.
we've looked at everything around here that looks out of place.
what are we doing wrong?
instead of looking for something out of place,
maybe we should be looking for something that belongs.
what is it?
it's a cache, but it wasn't left by somebody playing the game.
it was left by the killer.
LOTM okay, Chicago P. D. are canvassing the area and reviewing the security footage.
no prints on the note.
we need to learn everything there is to know about globocaching.
the use of G. P.S. coordinates,
the ammo case--none of these things were random.
he's using the game.
what about "L. O.T. M."? What the hell does that mean?
I asked Matthew Clarke about it.
these globocachers use "T. F.T. C." or "T. N.L. N.
but no "L.O.T. M."
Hey. That ladybug keychain? It's a travel hopper.
travel hopper?
when you find one in a cache, it's your job to take it and help it hop to another cache far away.
how does one see a travel hopper hop?
uh, they have tracking numbers on them.
did Bugzilla ever tell you if they saw anything in the woods?
I sent her a message, and she replied.
she's willing to meet.
how do you know it's a she?
there are male ladybugs?
it's sad and confusing for them, but they do exist.
I'll be wearing a ladybug shirt.
um, of course you will. But where?
cool. So you're the guy who found my hopper.
Where'd you find it?
in an ammo box in Poplar Woods.
Oh. That--that's where I hid it.
I guess it hasn't traveled anywhere yet.
it needs to go.
we can't actually do that.
you're supposed to put it in a different cache.
when you pick up a travel hopper, you agree to help it reach its goal.
and my ladybug is gonna make it to Hollywood.
and we'll help make all her dreams come true,
but right now your ladybug is being used as evidence in a murder investigation.
we're trying to find the identity of a young girl.
now when you placed your travel hopper, did you see anything suspicious?
not really. But as I was leaving,
I did see this guy walking towards the cache.
he could've just been another player,
but he was kind of creepy.
some of us have issues.
do you remember what he looked like?
do you recognize this man?
Yeah, I recognize him. He was here about an hour ago,
picked up a few patches and some coins.
well, do you know his name? Maybe you got his credit card information.
we really need his I. D.
then I need to see yours.
Chicago resident for 12 years.
seven years in accounts payable at Midwestern Fan Company.
single. Never married.
why do you know all that?
and why am I even here?
we have a few questions to ask you about the ammunition box found in Poplar Woods.
a skull and the bones of a young child were inside.
what does that have to do with me?
we have a witness that places you near the ammo box.
do you know anything about the bones?
I had nothing to do with that.
I just found the cache and then I went home.
well, everyone who finds it is supposed to leave something.
what did you leave behind?
I didn't leave anything.
I mean, I just forgot. I...
I just started playing the game. I didn't even think I was gonna find it.
and then when I did, I was so happy that...
I guess I got distracted and forgot about it.
but it was an honest mistake, you know?
he's lying.
as much as I'd like to hold him, I can't.
we can't prove he did anything wrong.
he never posted a message after he found the ammo box.
maybe if it was his first time playing the game,
wouldn't you think he'd want?
he's the killer. I mean, he took that little girl and...
okay, Alex. Wait a minute. I know where you are.
I was your partner when this first started. Remember?
but listen to yourself.
Hey. I just have a few more questions.
you're the man who was watching when that detective questioned me.
you said that you didn't put anything inside that cache.
that's right. Who are you again?
I'm the guy who thinks that you did put something inside that cache.
I think you left that puzzle and those bones.
I don't know what you're talking about, okay?
I don't know anything about that girl.
I never said it was a girl.
I heard the detective talking.
try again.
so you've got me all figured out then.
I know that you are responsible for that little girl's death and god knows how many others.
what, it starts to get boring for you?
that's why you put the bones in the box.
you wanted them to be found, didn't you?
you weren't getting enough credit for your work.
possibly.
and do you think it's also possible That maybe one of those "many more Might just be... your daughter?
what?
Alex, I saw you on the news last week.
your story really is too tragic for words.
no witnesses. No evidence. No crime.
just ghosts and shadows.
it's just a matter of time. - Maybe.
but...
in the meantime, thank you for everything.
it's all so much more than I could've possibly imagined.
I wonder if you'll find them.
I wonder if you'll find her.
good night, Alex.
Jane Doe wasn't his only victim.
if we can solve her case, maybe we'll get a clue to one of the others.
Alex... - One of them could've been my daughter!
look, we all wanna see this guy go down,
but what else can we do?
we're not cops, and he's on Russell's radar.
okay, well, we can check missing persons,
see if there's any other young girls who fit the profile.
I just got a blast e-mail from the globocaching web site.
someone just posted a platinum cache. - What's that?
a multi-step cache with a huge prize at the end.
who posted it online?
apparently... you did.
the user name is "Alex Donovan.
it's William Hollander. He's taunting me.
he doesn't think I'll catch him.
my guess is that the prize at the end has something to do with Jane Doe or... or another victim.
this is the first message also is the first clue.
wait. I don't understand.
what the hell is that?
Ding bats.
well, I was gonna say "fiddlesticks," But yes, it is frustrating.
they're a family of fonts called dingbats.
so what do we do with 'em?
most dingbats represent letters or numbers.
so think of the symbols as a language you don't know how to read.
it's all about finding the right translator.
I just have to download the font onto my computer...
so you can paste the clue into a word document and convert it.
and the clue... gives us coordinates.
should've worn my crazy lakeside nightwalking shoes.
do we know if it's even on the shore?
it could be in the water.
or those buoys.
I'll hold your flashlight.
okay.
how long can he hold his breath?
why you all looking at me? I don't even know his middle name.
he got it! All right!
what is it? - It's a flip book.
looks like U. S. Presidents, but it's definitely not in order.
presidents are numbered, right?
Bush--43. Obama--44.
the presidential numbers must be part of the coordinates.
I'll get my laptop.
I hate cemeteries.
well. Maybe we should come back in the morning.
I can't see anything.
I can see your fear.
I say we stay.
I agree. For all we know William Hollander designed this cache to be found at night.
well, let's just hope we find a clue and not another victim.
Hey, guys. I think I found something.
he found a blue reflector.
Hey, I found one. - Here's one.
I didn't find anything.
I see another one right in front of me.
I think they're forming two lines.
there's a lock on it with, uh, letters.
it's called a word lock. It's a combination of letters.
Hey, would you quit knowing everything? It's gettin' annoying.
william Hollander wants us to be able to open this.
we know what this combination is.
it's a 4-letter word.
so we make a list of all the 4-letter words we've seen since we started the case.
do it.
maybe it's a globocaching acronym,
like the one from the plaza.
try "L-o-t-m.
Oh alright
so you just type in the travel hopper's tracking number Into the globocache web site.
and if the owner registered it, it'll pull up a user name.
we got a hit.
the travel hopper belongs to "little princess.
can you... Click on her profile?
Stephanie Summers. Philadelphia.
she's our Jane Doe.
she was taken five years ago.
she loved to paint and draw. She used to get lost in it.
half on the page and half on her.
sounds about right.
I'm Lisa. I'm Stephanie's aunt.
I'm Alex Donovan. This is detective Grace Russell from Chicago.
hello. - We know who you are.
my family--we're very grateful for everything that you've done.
five years--it feels like a lifetime, but...
it's a relief to finally know what happened to her.
do you know who...
we have a suspect we are keeping an eye on.
are Stephanie's parents here?
um... Stephanie's father committed suicide last year.
he felt responsible even though he was at work, And she was playing in the backyard.
there was nothing he could've done.
and... Stephanie's mother?
Karen-- my sister. Um...
she left Philadelphia a couple of years after it happened.
well, where is Karen now?
she should know what happened to her daughter.
she didn't tell me.
my sister doesn't want to be found, Mr. Donovan.
she wanted to start over.
and knowing the truth is the only way that she can.
excuse me.
I'm gonna...
sure.
these friends of yours?
some of 'em.
was, uh...
was Stephanie your friend?
cousin. Listen, I live here, man.
are you one of those shrinks my mom sent?
shrink?
Wow. That's a first.
want to hear something really crazy?
I've got family that I never see.
they're a little older, a little weird,
and then there's my cousins Petey and Ellen.
they're awesome. We just seem to get each other.
I wish that I knew what made certain things easy and certain things difficult.
well, you have a good one.
it was my fault.
I was supposed to be with Steph that day.
I had strep throat,
and I guess I couldn't play.
sounds so weird saying it now...
play.
Troy was my best friend.
I told him all of my secrets.
we did everything together.
I miss him.
explorer one.
that's what I called her.
she always wanted to go on adventures.
and she had this magic capsule, too, with all her supplies.
she had it with her the day she disappeared, and...
magic capsule? - It was a backpack
full of markers, flashlights, a compass.
and when my family went to visit her house afterwards,
I thought the police were done with it.
you took it?
Yes. I mean, I didn't want it to get lost in the shuffle.
I just wanted one day...
to be able to give it back to her.
Stephanie Summers lived in a busy suburban neighborhood,
and nobody heard her scream when she was taken.
so? - So maybe she wasn't taken.
maybe William Hollande talked h.
exactly. I mean, her cousin Troy said she was decorating a tent that day.
he was chatting with her, trying to help her, trying to earn her trust.
maybe Hollander touched one of the paints or markers.
I don't know. This guy seems more clever than careless.
it's Grace.
Hey.
we dusted the items from the backpack in Philadelphia.
And? - On one of the magic markers. William Hollander.
the Philly P. D. had no reason to look for it before.
now keep in mind there's no chain of custody, so...
but you can still place him in the city.
we're arresting him now.
you screwed up.
it was hard to think straight when she was right there, wasn't it?
he started talking to me.
he made me think he was my friend, But he wasn't.
and now...
I don't have to keep it a secret anymore.
we got a warrant for your house.
we confiscated your computer.
Oh, I haven't smiled in a while, so...
thank you for making me smile.
remember?
grace, you disappoint me.
what are you talking about?
the note I left in the plaza.
the game had all those little acronyms, So I made my own.
left one...
took many.
there are more, Grace,
and unless you do something for me,
I'll never tell you who Or where they are.
you're here.
the D. A. made a deal with William Hollander.
he waived extradition from Pennsylvania for the murder of Stephanie Summers.
so Hollander is no longer eligible for the death penalty.
and in return...
Hollander confessed to three other murders after Stephanie.
he led detective Russell and Chicago P. D. to the bodies.
did he give any names?
no.
but they matched them up with missing persons.
And?
none of them was Lucy.
so this is great news.
she could still be alive.
stop it. I just-- I can't do it anymore.
I-I think I found her, and then it turns out it's not her.
all these years of--of chasing crackpot tips, false leads,
dead end-do you have any idea how destructive that is?
are you talking about giving up?
I'm talking about accepting the fact that my daughter is dead.
you don't know that.
you can't understand.
you're right.
you're right.
she's not my daughter.
I don't have kids.
but I do this work with you every day.
and until you know for sure, you don't have a choice.
you have to fight in your mind and keep her alive.
Maxine called.
she found Karen Summers, Stephanie's mom
where?
omaha, Nebraska.
maybe if you could see her and talk to her,
maybe she would go back to her family.
you said she needs to know.
Yeah.
can you come with me?
of course.
Hi. Is, uh, is your name Karen Summers?
uh, yeah, I'm not interested.
uh, no, no, no. Sorry.
uh, my name's Alex Donovan. This is Candace Butler.
we came here from Chicago.
we're with a group called The Forgotten Network.
do you have a daughter named Stephanie?
Yes.
I'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you this,
but her remains have been recovered.
miss Summers
Yes, um... I'm sorry. I just...
listen, we can go inside - No, no, no.
it's, um, I'm sure you understand.
it's--it's all a bit of a shock.
you'll, um, you'll be happy to know that they did catch the person who did it.
good. Good.
and we've spoken with your sister Lisa.
she would love to hear from you.
okay. Uh...
okay, um, I-I need to go
and-- and, um, deal with this right now, - So thank you for coming. - Of course.
thank you. - Sure.
that was a little weird.
I guess it is disturbing news.
someone you've never met walks up to your door and tells you that your daughter is really gone.
you know, I thought she'd want to know more.
I guess some people don't.
damn. I forgot to give her Stephanie's art.
I'll run it up. No, no, no. I'll do it. I'll do it.
I don't want to disturb her. I'll just leave it under the mat.
Lucy, it's me.
it's your dad.
mom! - Lucy, wait. Wait!
mom! Mom! - It's okay!
sweetie, sweetie, look at me. Look at me.
I'm your dad. I'm your dad. It's okay, sweetie.
Stacy, I told you we're leaving here in five minutes!
you don't understand.
her name is not Stacy. Her name is Lucy.
please. Please don't take her.
she's my daughter! I love her!
her name is not Stacy. Her name is Lucy.
she's not your daughter. She's mine.
I'm taking her home. Come on. Come on, sweetie.
it's okay, sweetie. - Oh, my god.
call the police! Come on.
the police arrested Karen.
she confessed.
she's not well.
she had left Philadelphia three years ago and drove through Chicago to visit some friends,
and she just happened to see the two of you when you were dropping Lucy off at school.
Lucy looks so much like Stephanie,
she just had to have her.
she doesn't even know who I am.
she's in shock.
maybe you are, too.
she doesn't know what to believe.
Mr. Donovan?
can we speak privately?
Oh, she's, uh, she's with me.
well, physically, your daughter's fine.
Mrs. Summers took very good care of her.
but mentally, there are some things you should know.
for the last three years,
she was told that her parents died in a car accident and that you asked Mrs. Summers to take care of her If anything happened to you.
it's going to take some time.
how or when you'll get through to her,
it's anyone's guess.
I'm just gonna sit for a minute, okay?
I know that this must be weird and difficult for you.
I am so happy to see you.
we're gonna go home now, okay?
I'm so sorry it took me so long to find you.
sweetie...
I never stopped loving you.
dad?
sweetie.
this is it.
you hungry? - You can cook?
uh, I can order pizza. - Yeah, and
uh, extra peppers.
this is where you live?
Yeah, yeah. And this is where you're gonna live, too,
at least part of the time.
I, uh, I haven't quite got your room fixed up just yet.
it's really...
nice?
brown.
what's this?
um, I don't know.
can't wait to meet you.
Candace, Tyler, Walter, Maxine and Grace.
who are they?
well, they're my team.
they're the people that helped me to find you and all the others.
we figure out where they came from,
what their stories are,
so their families can know
so the world can know, too.
we have regular jobs most of the time,
but this work, this mission,
it's only just beginning.
there's so much more to do,
so many people who need our help.
it defines us. It compels us.
because it doesn't just tell us who they are.
it tells us who we are.
guess most of all, they're, uh...
they're my friends.
then they're my friends, too.
come on.
get off me!
Oh, please.
please, don't hurt me.
it's wrong! She's too young!
the sins of the flesh will ruin her.
please don't hurt me!
please!
the wicked will be punished.
the mystery heart condition that has killed over 30 people in 4 years...has claimed another victim.
doctors are baffled as to why fit and healthy people are suffering massive heart attacks.
many residents claim that the "Shadow of Death" has again descended on the town.
"shadow of Death"? I don't like it.
that's what they're saying. People are scared out there.
for decades, Fairwater has been linked with death following the 1964 Bradley-Bartlett murder spree.
thirty years later, as the death toll steadily rises,it appears the Grim Reaper has once again returned to the quiet streets of Fairwater.
Oh, no. Steve, no.
I asked for a new angle. Give me something fresh.
I want to see the human face of this tragedy. Talk to the families.
how has this affected the local community?
Yes, Miss Rees-Jones.
and, Steve...no more references to death as a person.
friend of the family? Really such a shame.
go on. Get out. Go on.
get out!
damn.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I don't believe this. This is not happening. My lawn!
you ruptured my lawn!
Hey, how you doing?
give me a call. I'll pay for the damages.
you're damn right! I'm suing your ass!
don't get litigious. Send me a bill.
"frank Bannister, Psychic Investigator"?
so why didn't you see the corner coming?
you stupid moron! This is goddamn bullshit!
this will cost you big time!
you're paying for a new fence!
I want this lawn completely resurfaced!
my Budzo! My Budzo!
I got your license plate number! You bastard!
this is private property.
Mrs. Bradley? I'm Dr. Lynskey. I work at the medical center.
you do not. I know who works there.
I started 3 months ago.
Dr. Kamins is my physician.
he's attending a funeral. I'm seeing his patients today.
she was cutting vegetables. The knife slipped.
she just needs a few stitches. I'll drive you to the clinic.
that's impossible.
it's a deep cut.
leave us antibiotics.
mother, please.
Patricia never leaves the house.
but it hurts.
to your room this instant!
wait. Just a minute.
who did that to you?
I think you'd better go now, Dr. Lynskey.
you don't know who my daughter is, do you?
Patricia's not to be trusted.
I beg your pardon?
I can have her locked up anytime I want.
they said she was an accessory after the fact.
I know the truth.
it was cold-blooded murder.
in the space of 27 blood-soaked minutes,12 innocent people were shot by hospital orderly John Charles Bartlett.
patients, medical staff, visitors,no one was spared in this rampage through Fairwater Sanatorium.
not even the hospital chapel provided sanctuary, as those in prayer were shot on their knees.
we're reporters. We have to get the news!
a seemingly senseless crime...
Bartlett's motive remains a my stery to this day.
he's got a demonic look on his face.
any comments, Johnny?
got me a score of 12, sir. That's one more than Starkweather.
six years earlier, Charles Starkweather had murdered eleven people in a Nebraska killing spree.
guess that makes me public enemy number one!
fifteen-year-old Patricia Anne Bradley,daughter of the hospital administrator,was also implicated in the killings.
she was madly in love with the psychopath Bartlett.
that's her!
I was in her house this afternoon.
terrific. We're in town 3 months and you've befriened the Manson family.
2200 volts of electricity ended the life of Johnny Bartlett, the unrepentant killer.
as they threw the switch, he screamed:
I got me a score of twelve. Beat that.
in what some considered a miscarriage of justice...
Patricia Bradley was sentenced to life imprisonment,although it was never proven she participated in the killings.
five years ago, Patricia Bradley was ganted a conditional release by the governor.
today she lives a reclusive life back in the family home
should have fried her along with Bartlett.
she was fifteen years old. She fell in love with the wrong guy.
could happen to anyone.
sweetie, don't go back there. Please gives me the creeps.
I don't think...
come on, honey.
I think tiger's getting a little lonely.
what the hell is this doing here?
I thought I tore this up.
did he come back here? -Who?
the moron who tore up my fence!
help!
help! -He's alive.
ray, get me off!
you... sick... thing!
Lucy, I don't want that con man in my house!
there has to be some kind of rational explanation for this.
ray! We have got a poltergeist!
it's nothing the police can't handle.
Dr. Lynskey, I'm on my way.
persistent residue of the departed. Always a problem this time of year.
thank you. Thank you for coming.
the activity is located where?
I don't know. It went quiet about 5 minutes ago.
went quiet?
the dining room table spun in a counterclockwise direction?
I don't think that happened.
the toilet seat lid banged up and down?
did the bed levitate? -Yeah. With me on it.
spontaneous recurrent psychokinesis. Oh, boy.
this could be the worst case I've ever seen. It's bad.
well, I can do a clearance, but it's not going to be cheap.
I do offer a six-month guarantee.
how much?
and there is a 30% surcharge for making a house call after midnight.
and there's vehicle, gas.
I'd say the whole thing will set you back about ＄450.
we could forget about the fence, call it even.
stand back, ma'am. I don't want you to have to sign a waiver.
Plus, a hundred bucks for materials.
just do it, for Christ's sake.
here we go.
why us? Why are they in our house?
emanations are normally confined to the cemetery although they do escape.
usually young ones.
Oh, for God's sake, come on.
come on.
it's holy water.
this is bullshit. This is total bullshit.
come on, come on, come on.
Yes!
okay, these belong to you.
six ectoplasmic emnations.
don't worry. They can't escape.
some people like a souvenir.
I really don't think we want to keep those. Thank you. Do we, hon?
I could give a rat's ass.
okay, we'll just...
they can't feel a thing. At least that's what the book says.
you never know for sure.
all right. Thank you, Bannister. You can go.
what are you staring at?
what's with the number?
what number?
if you're trying to freak me out, it's not working.
he's just trying to get more money out of us.
get your shit and get the hell out of my house.
come on.
move!
thank you so much.
there you go.
Thanks. -Thank you.
why must you always alienate everybody?
I think I'm going to throw up.
damn.
I hate that trunk!
I don't want ectoplasmic muck all over my car seats.
the ectoplasm is the only thing sticky enough to hold the damn car together.
I'm sorry about your shit Volvo, but we won't ride in the trunk no more.
we could like to cruise with some style, man.
you two left me high and dry.
I get to the house, nothing's happening. I couldn't believe it.
Hey, Stuart--in or out.
not even a banging toilet lid. I looked like a asshole.
we strained our backs lifting that heavy-ass bed.
Oh, yeah. What idiot put the number on the guy's forehead?
it wasn't funny.
start pulling your weight, or it's back to the ecmetery.
pull this, Frank. I'm about to go like Jesse on your ass.
I'm going to find some other black ghosts and organize a march.
the African-American Apparition Coalition. The AAAC.
I'll tell you something.
nothing's worse than some pissed-off brothers that's already dead!
therefore, a happy ghost is a productive ghost.
to that end, I've drawn up a list of suggesttions.
bear in mind, we have given you five years of loyal service.
flies. That's what you've given me, flies.
why do flies stick to you guys like shit to a blanket?
very funny. You're a funny guy.
you only think about yourself. I could complain, too.
I need some new clothes. I still look like Linc from "The Mod Squad."
you died in the '70s. Bummer.
now, Frank, we got to talk about cigars.
you promised to buy me a box.
I hate to tell you, but you're dead. You can't smoke.
light one and blow the smoke in my face.
if I light a cigar, I'll blow my lunch in your face.
everybody, get down! Damn it, Judge!
put the shooters away!
that was a head shot! He could have killed me!
if I wanted to get shot at every day, I'd move to Los Angeles!
when a man's jawbone drops off,it's time to reassess the situation.
I got myself a nice little grave up there at the cemetery.
it could soon be time to lay my bones.
you're my go-to guy. Without you, I'm out of business.
Frightening...that's a young man's game, Frank.
I ain't got no more hauntings left in me.
what? You're in great shape.
my joints are getting powdery.
the dog is running away with my face. Hell, I'm falling apart.
you have been for years.
don't say nothing to the boys, but my ectoplasm is all dried up.
I'm sorry to hear that, Judge.
give it up, Frank.
death ain't no way to make a living.
I have to finish this house.
you'll never finish this house! You'll never finish nothing!
you're fooling yourself, Frank!
too many skeletons in the closet.
okay, this is it. We got to be hard.
we go in like Charles Bronson. We don't stop till the screaming starts.
I'm with you.
let's go.
Yeah. let's kich some ass.
here we go. One, two, three.
good morning, my darlings. Hello.
the mail is on the table, Mrs. Waterhouse.
Sylvia, Mother is coming for lunch. Pick up. Quick.
big kiss.
quit jumping around like a baby. This is serious.
we're going to scare the living daylights out of your parents.
will you help us out? -Are you with us?
see? He gets it. The kids always get it.
let's go.
Mrs. Waterhouse.
Mrs. Waterhouse!
damn. Here, man. This one did le poo-poo.
get it away from me. -Oh, man, it smells.
Mrs. Waterhouse!
my babies!
I'm on my way.
persistent residue of the departed. Always a problem this time of year.
Frank Bannister. I believe you called. Not a minute too soon.
Frank, she-- -Shut up.
Frank, it's no use.
this is bad.
recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis.
this could be the worst case I have ever seen.
I apologize for calling you, Mr. Bannister. Please leave.
what are you doing to me?
preying on the bereaved is as low as you can go.
you're a parasite. People should be warned.
I've a right to offer my services to the public.
in case you haven't noticed, we are having a major health crisis.
the last thing the people here need is a two-bit charlatan passing on bogus messages from the other side.
now, if you will excuse me.
I'm just trying to make a living.
living? Not a word you'd know a lot about, is it, Mr. Bannister?
Hey, easy.
you all right, buddy?
that was quite a fall.
you have to help. They're going to bury me.
you have to help. What is happening to me?
you appear to be dead, Ray.
that's impossible. I'm in the prime of my life.
I work out. My wife's a doctor!
why didn't you take the corridor? -What corridor?
the passageway to the other side.
because I don't belong there! Jesus Christ, I'm only 29!
just relax, all right? Tell me what happened.
I was on the rowing machine.
suddenly, I felt this vice-like grip squeezing my heart and I couldn't breathe, Frank, I just couldn't breathe.
I have the shakes. I need some vitamin B.
you can't take vitamins anymore.
you don't eat, drink or go to the bathroom. All that's over with.
in a year, you'll get another chance for the other side, to be a pure spirit.
in the meantime, you're an earthbound emanation, a rotting cloud of bioplasmic particles, dripping ectoplasm.
relax, Ray.
all right, Bannister.
can you give me a ride so I don't miss my funeral?
don't worry. They won't hurt you.
what in the hell is going on out here? Get back in your graves!
son of a...
holy Jesus. Frank Bannister!
go ahead. I'll handle this.
what are you doing in my graveyard? You have been tole to stay away!
sound off like you have a pair!
it's a public place, Hiles.
I do not like you!
do not bring your spooks in here without permission. Disappear, scumbag!
I am not one of your shitty little emanations!
you cannot push spirits around! You are scum!
using spooks to put the frighteners on people! That makes me physically ill!
we have a lot of lowlifes around here!
I will provide an armed response at any sign of trouble!
they must be contained!
catch you later, Hiles.
my tour of duty runs another 85 years!
there's a piece of dirt here with your name on it.
I'm waiting for you, you little maggot!
there were times when people accused Ray of being less than generous, but I am sure that deep down the man possessed a heart of gold and a generous spirit.
it's true. He wouldn't lie, not at a time like this.
because God has chosen to call Ray from this life to Himself, we commit his body to the ground.
earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Jesus, what a waste.
it's a goddamn tragedy!
good-bye, Ray.
Oh, sweetheart, don't cry.
Oh, shit!
Hey, Frank!
I know you can hear me!
get me out of this hole!
Frank! Get me out!
Hiya, Frank.
Hi, Walt.
I'm surprised to see you. Here on business?
not exactly.
they're going to bury me alive!
I hear you and Lynskey had a little run-in the night before he died.
apart from his wife, you were the last person to see him alive.
you're the one here on business.
no. The FBI is very concerned about these deathes.
they look like heart attacks, but when they slice these people open, their arterise are clean as a whistle.
but there's been tremendous pressure on the heart like the life's been crushed out of it.
you got any theories?
you mind if I pay my last respects before they fill him in?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
please.
Mr. Bannister.
did you want to see me?
my God, Frank, she can see me!
I thought perhaps you might have a message from Ray.
tell her. Tell her I'm here, Frank. Tell her.
everyone says you're a fraud, but I've seen what you can do.
Frank!
you must think I'm very stupid. Excuse me.
Lucy.
ray says he loves you very much.
here is your table.
is Ray with us?
tell her she looks great.
he, uh, he says you look great.
tell her they're from me.
those are from Ray.
it's our anniversary.
he says it's your anniversary.
is--is Ray beside me?
greetings.
how are you this evening? May I offer you some wine?
