don't! Stop!
please remember me.
I will wait for you, Arisu.
even if you were to go to America, I'd wait for you.
and Tokyo is so near!
morinaga, the chocolate Arisu brought from Japan.
is this the chocolate that was in 'The Flame of Love'?
Yes, of course. Here you are.
only after the ship disappeared did he begin to shed tears.
Why? Because a real man does not let his love see his tears.
what are you doing so early in the morning?
have a seat.
be careful.
this is an unauthentic transmitter-receiver.
this enables users to pick up radio waves without paying.
this is from China. And it can also send signals.
but why are we?
let me explain.
we thought about how we can send out our own message over the air.
we find an electric wave the same as the radio frequency.
and let it carry our voice. We can go on air nationwide.
I have already set the frequency.
610 KZH.
HZ, HZ, dummy.
say something.
this is...
this is...
a radio station better than the Seoul Broadcasting Station.
the time is...
10: 10 a. m.
the end.
what is that?
Mr. Murakami, the managing director of Number One Seasoning brought it.
he said it is a gift.
he wants me to eat all of this and die?
what a weirdo.
Hello?
Yes.
honey, you've got a call.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
wait, those are my things...
Ah, you're early.
who are you, sir?
he is an observer here to help you from now on.
he was dispatched by the postal office.
which means you're now under supervision.
what kind of supervision, sir?
don't you know about this morning's radio wave interception?
we don't know who made the prank, but what if guerrillas were to use it?
now that would be a disaster.
I have ordered Noh to revise today's episode.
why does seasoning pop up out of nowhere?
why not? It makes it more real.
this drama lacks reality.
the characters are always drinking coffee!
you think that makes sense?
they should use stuff like spices.
to make things seem like it's really happening.
that's reality. Know what I mean?
but it disrupts the flow of the story.
you think this is some grand masterpiece?
do as I say or the transmission will be cut off immediately.
remember that!
Marie is a modern girl, with a charm that's both pure and sexy.
and she's got boobs too. So she's the perfect woman.
and how come her lover is a poor sick bum?
talking about me? - Yeah!
is this drama being made for Marie?
no, this is a drama for all of us.
but how come you're so pitiful when she's got everything?
just think about all the roles you play.
you do the narration, play Jang-hoon, tell the time, and do the news.
honestly, you're the busiest man in this whole radio station.
Yeah. - So?
you are not recognized.
but I have to follow the script. Plus, I can't improvise like Marie.
Yes, you can.
why not?
arisu, you must be tired from such a long journey.
cold noodles?
Yes, perfect in this hot weather.
Oh, Arisu!
Young-shin has been so kind as to nurse me while you were gone.
Young-shin, I'm most grateful.
the soup tastes wonderful!
what did they put in it?
in this modern world, you can't use the traditional broth.
just half a spoon of the new artificial seasoning by Number One.
it's really popular in Japan, too!
it's the basics of cooking.
all modern women use it.
restaurants get more business once they start using Number One.
and it saves them costs.
it's the spice for success.
Oh, this Kimchi tastes extraordinary!
they must've used Number One.
so good! - Miss Arisu said it tastes good.
the three finished their noodles flavored with Number One.
Young-shin is doing the dishes in the kitchen.
while Arisu and Jang-hoon are enjoying themselves at a scenic spot in Seoul.
Oh, how I missed you!
I, too, did not imagine you would return so soon.
let's get married.
but, uh...
excuse me, Arisu and Mr. Jang.
may I join you?
of course.
since we are all gathered here, I have an announcement to make.
I, Jang-hoon, am now liberated from tuberculosis.
I am indebted to Miss Young-shin's devotion and care.
and so, I would like to tell you about an important decision.
I will apply to The Imperial University of Seoul.
I will no longer sit idle like a sick man.
I will enroll in the university, and study Economics.
then join the Commercial Bank and become the best bachelor.
what happened?
it's so dark in here.
then switch on the light!
Where's the switch?
I don't know. I am very scared.
it's here.
this place is so cool!
isn't it? Okay, tell me, would you find any place as romantic as this in Goa?
no one will even come to know. By the way, Rohan.
whom does this bungalow belong to?
nath Villa
it's really interesting.
this big, empty house has me, you and a ghost!
have you brought something to eat or not?
of course, I have!
and you know what I have arranged?
candle light dinner along with champagne!
perfect! So you keep the dinner ready!
I will go and freshen up quickly.
okay! I will also come!
I will go and freshen up, you keep the dinner ready.
Tina. - Bye!
you're still here?
please come down! I am famished.
Tina, dinner is ready.
what?
you were just here, weren't you?
what? Why would I stand there?
I was downstairs getting the dinner ready.
come on! Let me show you what I've made!
then who was that?
Oh! I get it! Now you are trying to scare me! Wait!
I got scared! How cute you are!
come on, let me show you what I've made!
I've made excellent dinner!
and I've decorated candles too!
look! Look how beautiful it looks! Come here!
Hey, hey, hey! Honey, our candle will get extinguished.
please close the window. Close the window! Quickly!
hold it. Hold it.
Rohan, there's someone over there!
Tina, enough! It's enough now!
I just saw someone! Please! Let's leave!
this is just an illusion of your mind!
now why are you screaming? It's just power cut!
T. V. is on.
Tina, there's no electricity, how will the T. V work?
Rohan, I'm telling you! There is someone here.
please listen to me! - Enough! Enough!
Tina, stop it! Stop it. You're ruining the evening! Stop it!
wait here!
please believe me. I am not lying.
let's see now. - I have seen something. Please.
is anyone here? Is anyone here?
stop it, Rohan! - Is there anyone?!
there is! - Did you see anyone?!
look here! Look here too! Tina, there is no one here!
give me the keys.
Hey, Anthony, get up. Go away from here. Go.
Hey, let me stay here. I will take care of it.
you can't take care of yourself and you wish to take care of the bungalow.
come on, get up. Go away from here.
Hey! This is my bungalow.
no one other than me can dare to stay here!
a ghost resides in here.
Hey, Jagan, tell me who will stay here!
come on, come on! See, Banku! This, All this is Goa.
Wow! - Where's our house?
our house. that's our house.
that isn't our house. - Hey!
stop it! Stop it! You talk all rubbish!
Hey, how would you know?
you were sleeping when we went house hunting.
Really? - Yes, like always.
okay. Okay. - Listen, wait a minute. Listen.
let me just show him!
Hey! Come on! Come on! - Okay, come on.
your taxi is vacant, sir.
come, come, come! - Mister. mister.

Hey! Just a moment, mister. What are you doing?
Aditya, tell them.
we don't want to go sightseeing! Wait! Tell them!
tell them the name of the road! Tell them the address quickly! Wait!
don't... don't you remember? Wait a minute. - Wait.
nath villa. Nath villa.
what happened, man? Hey mister. Hey, mister.

they were fighting to take us just now, what happened now?
madam, no one is going to take you there.
sir, no one will take you there.
Why?
I suggest you too shouldn't go there.
don't go if you don't want to. We will hire another taxi.
come, Banku.
listen, sir, I will take you there if you want. Come.
take that. Take that. - Come, come.
and hold this.
come, dear, come.
the bus stops when the conductor rings the bell!
you sing well. Anyway.
why didn't the other taxi guys want to go to Nath Villa?
sir, I'll ask you something.
are you related to Mr. Nath?
no, no, we have rented that bungalow.
Hey, then take another bungalow.
why are you asking for trouble, sir?
Why? What's wrong over there?
madam, it is said that there's a spirit in there!
there is a ghost in there!
ghost!
Hey, there are no such things as ghosts. Nonsense.
Hey! - You mentioned ghost and the car.
what happened?
just a moment Just a moment.
I think the car won't move forward, sir.
so? Will we have to walk?
Yes, you will have to walk from here.
it's close by.
come, Banku, let's carry mummy and take her.
Oh no!
here's Nath Villa.
Hey, you are Mr. Aditya, right?
I am Jagan. I am the caretaker here.
take this. Take it. Good. Here's the bag.
greetings. - Greetings.
come. Come.

come on, Banku. - Come on.
come.
such a big house! This is even bigger than grandpa's house!
come, I will show you the bungalow from inside. Come.
it's jammed.
from how long has it been locked?
not for long, I just got it cleaned.
as soon as I learnt of your arrival.
I got it cleaned. First class.
this is clean?
it is clean. And anyway, you will do the rest of the cleaning.
I think we will have to break the glass. Hey!
Banku, what are you doing?
uncle said that.
but.
no problem, we will install another one.
then I will break it completely.
good idea.
Hey, I was just wonder how I will handle all this by myself.
Hey, now that it's broken.
then open the window and open the door.
come, come, I will get it.
hmm. Get the luggage.
such a big house!
Oh my God! Such a big house!
great!
people used to build such lavish house in olden times.
your company is great.
couldn't they give us a medium sized house? - Anjali!
sister-in-law, there's a terrace upstairs. - What?
Oh wow! There's a terrace too!
Hey! No. Banku. Banku.
there are stairs, Banku. You'll fall down.
OK. Sister-in-law, you will get water 24 hours a day.
you can wash clothes and utensils whenever you want. You can do anything you want!
Hey, your sister-in-law needs just one hour for the clothes and utensils.
anjali does everything very fast.
Yes, so come, I'll show you the kitchen.
you are too much, Aditya.
go, see the kitchen. - Come. - Go on. Go on.
this one, right? - Yes.
here.
listen, I wanted to ask you something.
I have heard a lot of rumours about this house.
the cabbie too was saying that there are ghosts here.
this is all nonsense, sir.
look, actually, the owner of this house stays in America.
I have the responsibility of this house, so they're jealous.
they are just rumours.
trust me, sir. It's nothing like that. Sign here.
mama!
mama!
Hey! What happened! - Calm down. Calm down, Anjali.
mama! - Banku!
what happened, Banku?
such a big terrace! It will be so much fun to play cricket here!
Hey, so what's there to scream in that?
look how scared mama got!
I...I wasn't scared.
but I got scared. You have a very naughty kid. - You too.
go down, dear. - Come on, bowl to me!
come on. - Let's go down now.
kids are bound to be mischievous, Mr. Jagan.
anyway, how many kids do you have?
I have two daughters. They are very simple.
I have to toil hard outside the house all day long for them. - Banku!
Yes, one has to stay out of the house for work.
look at me, I stay out for months.
by months you mean?
I am the chief engineer in a cruise liner.
I have to go where the cruise goes. - Okay!
and he leaves us behind.
that's why I wanted a house where.
I don't have to worry about them.
where they are safe.
Yes, it's very safe in here.
you don't have to worry about anything here, but just.
Oh yes, I forgot about this.
what? So what else could have I made?
nothing. Sandwich is our favourite.
that's why it's sandwich for breakfast.
sandwich for lunch, sandwich for dinner!
sandwich, sandwich, sandwich! Witch!
Papa. - Yes?
will mummy give me sandwiches in tiffin here too?
no, no. She will make Maggie sometimes.
I can hear everything. - Good then.
okay, when is your cruise leaving?
in 2 days.
no. Not at all.
you can't go anywhere until everything is set in the house.
Yes, papa.
no, son, I will have to go.
I can't have these sandwiches anymore.
very funny!
Anjali, don't feel bad.
look, don't keep sleeping in the morning.
wake up with the alarm.
otherwise Banku will miss his school.
that's fine, but first make your little scamp understand to keep his mischief in control.
come on. Be realistic, Anjali.
we can ask him to do only what he can.
I say, Banku, look, do new mischief in your new school.
OK? Don't get on with your old mischief.
and look, don't trouble mummy at all!
otherwise, you know, I get very angry!
I've scared him, now he will be in control.
ADI, what's going on? You're a father now.
why don't you behave like one? What is wrong with you?
the boy understands English. Don't scold me in front of him.
I will get insulted.
he won't respect us when he grows up.
Banku, close your eyes. I am going to kiss mummy now.
ADI! - One more, mummy! Now family hug time.

your eyes are so innocent!
Banku, will you come to school everyday?
good. You will bring tiffin everyday?

children often get scared on the first day.

we're going to hit them hard.
we'll slap you, knock you out and kick you around.
if you say we'll hit and count.
we are the tigers of the jungle where you're nothing but a jackal.

so you are...you are the ghost. - I am...I am not a ghost.
then? - I am Anthony.
I... I had come to steal Pepsi so that I can mix it in a drink.
stealing? Stealing? You! - Don't hit me! - Wait!
help me! - People are scared of coming here, thanks to you.
I've a hard time finding a maid here.
and you want to get drunk!
get down! - No! - Get down! - I won't, you'll hit me.
that, I will for sure. - Then I won't come down.
okay, fine, come on, get down.
you won't hit me, will you?
I won't hit you, get down.
I had come here for Pepsi but I saw the snacks.
I was having drinks without snacks for so many days.
go to grocery everyday and get snacks for me. - Okay!
so I will get snacks for you! - Don't hit me! Don't hit me!
here you go! - Don't hit me!
here you go! - I am doomed! - You!

Hey, it got disappeared! - It got disappeared!

my papa has brought this from South Africa.
Yes, even I have got this. Use it on peon Prasad.
if you can do this, I will laud you. - Where is he?
he is coming. He is coming. - He is coming. He is coming.
sir, sir. it will just go away,
.sir. 5, 4, 3. no, it didn't.
I have seen so many tiffins and kids, but none of the kids have done what he did to me!
I will scold him. I...I will scold him.
but that's only possible if you'll tell me about it.
you're not even facing me.
would you like to see? - Yes.
Oh no, Banku, you naughty boy!
you think that's funny? - I am so sorry, sir.
you're looking so funny that I couldn't control myself.
then control. Then Mrs. Sharma, control your laughter as well as this your kid!
he is not innocent, he is a devil himself!
I had warned you, sir.
but I promise that he will never do such a thing after today.
Banku, say sorry. - Sorry, sir.
it's okay, you can go.
sir. sir, one small request.
ask someone to take your photo while you're like this.
what? - Let's go, Banku.
sir. shall I call one, sir? - Who?
the photographer. - Shut up! Shut up!
so you are Jojo? You changed the ink?
Yes, because he was telling everyone that I have this and I have that.
Yes, I have. So why won't I show it?
Hey, hey, what is this? Is this a WWF now?
come on, let's just stop fighting.
come on, let's get you two to be friends.
just shake hands. Huh!
Hey, come on.
JoJo, come to play with Banku at our home sometimes.
Yes, we have quite a big terrace.
Really? Where do you stay?
nath Villa.
nath Villa? No. I won't go there.
that's where the ghost lives.
a ghost resides there!' - Ghost?
mama, what is ghost?
when you won't do your homework.
and someone will come and beat you, that's the ghost.
do we have ghost in our home? Everyone says that.
son, there's nothing like ghost.
there was a thief called Anthony who lurked in our house and tried to scare everyone away.
today I beat him and drove him out.
Really? You beat him? - That's right.
he was trying to steal things from the kitchen.
I just made him run away.
so he was possessed?
ghosts don't exist. There are just angels.
angels? What is an angel?
angels. When someone makes the God happy.
God makes him an angel, Like your grandfather.
when your grandfather went to God, God said.
Hey, you are Banku's grandfather!
so I will turn you into a star, so that you can watch Banku forever.
mama, have you seen an angel?
Yes, I have. And his name is Banku. Banku! Banku! Banku!
if I find an angel someday? - Yes?
what will I do.
just befriend with him and tell him your stories.
what will he look like?
if grandfather has sent him, then he must look like him.
then I can recognise him. - Yes!
Papa's call!
Banku, slowly, the stairs!
Papa! - Great! Naughty boy!
how did you know it was your papa's call?
what were you doing? - Do you know, today I spilled ink on the principal at school.
Oh very good! Very good! You started pulling pranks again.
then what! - They called me to school on the first day itself.
tell him something or else he will be rusticated.
and how is your work going on?
Anjali, workload is quite heavy, I might come late.
did you set everything in the house? - No.
the luggage has arrived from the cargo.
but I just can't find a maid.
everyone is scared because of the legend of the ghost.
and ghosts don't exist.
there can't be any better ghost than him.
good night. - Good night.
ice-cream.
mama!
mama!
mama!
Banku, what happened? - I just saw someone here.
where? - There.
but what were you doing here?
I just took out ice-cream and I turned.
ice-cream! Didn't I tell you not to? - Just a little.
and that too spilled down. Hey, where is the bowl?
mama, the bowl and spoon were right here.
first, you ate an ice-cream without asking me.
and on top of that, you say, you saw someone?
it's true. I saw someone here.
I told you about the angel and you started spinning a tale.
you'll start crying if I hit you now.
just go upstairs.
and don't touch the fridge without my permission.
how will you get up early in the morning for school?
forget you, how will I get up?
you've become so mischievous.
you should be sent to the boarding school.
Hey! Let's go upstairs! So much drama for an ice-cream!
someone's there!
now why are you looking here and there?
come on, come upstairs.
I opened the fridge, took out the ice-cream.
the bowl fell from my hand, then where did it go?
look at this.
I said that the bowl has fallen over here.
but mama doesn't believe me.
you had hidden the bowl, hadn't you?
you have come to steal the ice-cream?
okay, so you are Anthony, who was beaten by mama.
I am a ghost.
ghosts don't exist. Mama said that angels exist.
okay, so you're an angel.
I said I am a ghost.
I said ghosts don't exist!
okay, so you have come to stay here.
No! This is my house.
I have come here to drive you out from here.
this is our house.
this is my house.
this is our house. - I said this is my house! - Softly, softly.
if mama hears us, then this won't remain anybody's house.
you little boy, you talk too much.
wait! Little boy! I will teach him a lesson!
you tall fellow, my name is Banku. And yours?
didn't you see my name outside at the gate? Nath.
sometimes you say you are a ghost.
sometimes you say you are Nath.
okay, is your name Bhootnath?
I am a ghost, and not Bhootnath.
this is my house. Come on, get out of here.
I said it's our house, but you can stay here.
I'll convince mama.
so you won't agree like that. I'll have to do something.
what will you do?
wait! I'll tell you.
Hey, why are you laughing?
you're making funny faces. - Funny faces?!
of course! If you take part in a fancy dress competition.
you'll win the first prize.
he's a strange child. - The whole world is scared of me and he laughs at me.
Hey, I am trying to scare you. Don't you get scared?
do you get scared? - Why should I get scared?
everyone says a ghost resides here. Have you seen him?
why would I see him?
but don't get scared. I stay in this room with mama.
if you get scared, then just call me.
now we are friends, aren't we?
friends?
one more thing. - What?
come closer. - What?
I want to go to the bathroom.
bathroom? - Bathroom.
then go. - Come with me.
you go. Why would I come with you?
am l...a ghost or...not?
even you want to go to the bathroom, don't you?
hey quiet, go away!
he got scared. I am a ghost.
now I'll teach a lesson to this little one.
little boy, you're sleeping. Come on, get up.
let me sleep. - Get up. Get up. Get up.
let me sleep! - Get up. I said get up.
he slept! Now how will he get up?
wake up, Banku. Banku!
Hey, he went down again!
ice-cream!
my naughty angel. - Angel!
you know who had hidden this bowl? - Who?
angel, an angel resides in our house.
Really? Then he must have eaten this ice-cream too.
no, he didn't. I even asked him.
now he will stay here, with us. Now I am his friend.
good, I will tell the angel to brush your teeth everyday, help you with your homework and take you to school.
alone?
and you know what he said?
tell me that afterwards.
you're getting late for school. Come on.
mama, it's not a story. The angel really exists.
Yes, I am not denying it. Okay, listen there shouldn't be any complaint about you in school today. Okay?
Bye, mama. - Bye.
Bye, angel.
you and your angel.
I saw, there was a tall man wearing a black coat standing in front of me.
I got up and went to him. I asked him, yes?
who are you? What are you doing in my house?
he turned towards me.
he had long hands!
his teeth were black too, his eyes were red.
is that an angel or a ghost?
cleaning.
such a big house to clean!
Hey, why are you still standing here?
do you want to be beaten up again?
this was my house. I don't have a place to stay.
nor any work to do.
will you clean the house? - I'll clean everything.
don't steal anything or I'll get you arrested by the police.
if you work properly, then I'll give you 20 rupees a day.
give me 25 rupees. I'll be able to buy a bottle of liquor then.
please. Please. - Come on, pick up the broom.
come on, hurry up. - Thank you.
come on, start from here and...ugh...you are so dirty.
go, have a bath first.
Yes.
come on, give me 25 rupees. Hey!
go away! Go away!
look at this!
what are you looking at? - Can't you see?
I am seeing everything. You haven't cleaned anything.
there's so much work pending inside.

father, this is Mr. Pradhan. He owns a resort business.
he is buying our house.
we have already bought it, Mr. Kailash Nath.
actually, we are only finishing the paper work tomorrow.
excuse me, Mr. Pradhan, but this house is not for sale.
but Vijay told me that.
he is still a child.
it's not he who will decide what has to be done about this house.
Vijay, what is this?
I am very sorry, Mr. Pradhan.
you keep the papers ready. We'll talk tomorrow.
this house won't be sold! Didn't you hear that?
I had great difficulty in getting such a nice price. And you.
you are selling your house?
what? What's so special about this house, father?
what's so special about this house?
you're asking me what's so special about this house?
you've spent your childhood in this house.
when the first time you came into your mother's lap in this house.
your mother's happiness resides in this house.
when you started to walk, her. her smile.
and when you used to fall sick your mother used to stay awake all night and look after you.
that worry resides in this house.
and when she fell sick and was breathing her last.
she was waiting for her son to come home that longing resides in this house.
father, you don't understand.
all of us will go back to America.
and then, who's going to look after such a big house?
let's sell it.
why should we sell it? All of us will stay here together.
no, father, I can't stay here.
and I can't even come back from there every time.
my work suffers, Vibhut's studies suffer.
and if he has to stay here.
then why did you send him abroad?
I sent him to study and not to settle over there.
father, then come to America with us.
there's nothing left here now.
and anyway, what will you do here alone?
even mother is no more now.
mother hasn't gone anywhere, son.
she is over here, in this very house. She's listening to you.
you go. Go and do your work
I'll stay here and wonder where I went wrong in nurturing you.
this is really humiliating!
I mean, do you have any right on this house or not?
I am sorry, Vijay, but l can't stay here anymore!
and no need to take him to America.
he is not coming with us to America!
Papa, I won't go.
father.
father, l.
never mind, dear. People make mistakes.
every human makes mistakes.
no, father. We are going.
you are going? What do you mean by you are going?
father, we are going back to America.
no, no, Vijay. Listen, you. where are you going?
father, you can come to America whenever you want.
how will I live without all of you?
I'll keep sending you the cheques every month.
Vijay, listen to me. Grandpa, I won't go.
no, dear. We won't go anywhere. Nowhere.
daughter-in-law, keep the luggage back.
Vibhut, come on. Come down.
No! I won't go!
I said come down!
Vijay! - Vibhut, come here, son. Vibhut, come here!
no, Vijay, if you can't live without your son.
then even I can't live without my son. Don't go, Vijay.
don't go.
what are you doing, daughter-in-law?
grandpa, I won't go! Grandpa, I won't go!
grandpa, I won't go!
Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay, don't go, Vijay! Vijay!
Vijay, don't. Ieave me and go, Vijay.
I was lying right here, but he didn't turn around and see me even once.
not even once.
since then I've been wandering in this house.
I never allowed anyone to live in this house.
this he came my angel
he changed me.
I forgot that I'm not alive.
does it hurt now?
no, dear, it doesn't hurt now.
how long will you keep wandering like that?
why don't you forgive your son?
No! Never! I won't forgive him!
he left me, but I will never leave this house! I won't!
even if I have to wander here for the next 100 lives!
100 lives
now only you people will live in this house.
Banku will stay here
forever
you people can't leave this place. No.
you people can't go.
is he still here?
so, where is he right now?
Kailash Nath used to love his son.
he offered many prayers for him in this temple.
now he has got attached to your son.
priest, that's what we are fearing that what if he does anything to Banku.
Oh no, no. Kailash has never caused anyone any harm.
he won't do anything.
then what should we do now?
post death ceremony.
we will have to do it for his soul to rest in peace.
but only his son can do that.
Yes. He should be the one to do it.
anyway this rite hasn't been performed after Kailash's death.
who would have done it?
his son was abroad.
well, I have heard that he is here these days.
then I will meet and talk to him.
Ah. If you heed my advice then your son can give Kailash his salvation.
God answers to children's prayers.
God will surely accept his prayers.
aditya. - Hi.
I always come here when I come to Goa.
you come to Goa but you don't go home.
you stay there.
and you want to throw us out of there.
I am bringing down Kailash Villa.
this time I will sell the land and leave Goa forever.
no house, no ghost.
not ghost but a spirit. A disgruntled spirit of your father.
disgruntled? Dissatisfied.
father has always been dissatisfied with me.
he could never understand me.
or perhaps you could never understand him.
Vijay, your father is attached to that house.
he doesn't want the house full of your mother's memories to be demolished.
perhaps that's why his soul has still been wandering.
look Aditya, I don't believe in all this.
and I find it really funny that my father's soul troubles everyone other than me.
doesn't trouble, just gives a sense of his presence.
you know a lot about my father.
the day you were leaving the house.
your father went after his son to stop him.
and he slipped and fell down and maybe.
maybe even screamed.
but his son didn't turn around and looked at him even once.
that was an accident! - That's what you think.
what do you want to say? I killed my father?
you don't know anything. I was not wrong.
he couldn't even understand such a small thing that l.
now you aren't able to understand such a small thing!
Vijay. Vijay, all you need to do is apologise.
that too from your father.
just come home and apologise to him once.
maybe his soul will rest in peace.
you have come to tell me what I should do?
no, I have come to inform you that we have kept veneration so that your father's soul rests in peace.
we are performing a post death ceremony.
post death ceremonies aren't performed in America.
but people still attain salvation.
a son performs this rite for his father.
Hey, so you do it. Prayer veneration and all. Do as you please.
I am coming to take the house keys the next day.
okay, I will surely keep some offerings for you.
anyway Vijay, even I didn't believe in all these things.
but I agree that some things are always left incomplete.
this veneration too will be incomplete without you.
tomorrow, we are keeping a small veneration for your Bhootnath.
Really? Is it his birthday?
for his rebirth, for his salvation.
salvation, what's that?
come here, Banku.
look, like you have gone from grade one to grade two.
similarly with this veneration your Bhootnath.
he will become a star angel from and ordinary one.
star angel! I will just go and inform him.
Hey, Banku. Banku!
bhootnath, you know I am keeping veneration for your salvation.
salvation?
Yes. Like I went from grade one to grade two similarly.
you will become a star angel from and ordinary one.
just like my grandpa.
look there. - Let me look.
let me look at you to my heart's content.
I don't know whether I will be able to meet you again or not.
Why? You too will look at me like grandpa does, won't you?
I will. I will only be watching you.
promise me that you too will look at me everyday.
promise. But what if the clouds come?
not even God can come between us.
promise me that you will never trouble your mother.
if she doesn't give me an ice cream then I will.
promise me that you will never leave your parents.
so many promises that too at one go?
bhootnath, you will just get salvation.
you won't be going anywhere.
okay, but the last.
promise me that you will never fight with anyone.
and you will always forgive everyone.
I will not forgive anyone. - No, it's necessary to forgive.
like dirty clothes become clean after a wash.
your heart becomes clear by asking for forgiveness.
then why didn't you forgive your son?
why do you carry the burden of anger in your heart?
the one who forgives his enemy is the one who attains knowledge and salvation.
time passes by.
the day sets in and the night follows.
when a small lamp shines in the dark night.
though small, the old traveller uses its light to toddle ahead.

the day sets in and the night follows.

time passes by.
the day sets in and the night follows.
while leaving I realized who is a near one.
and who is a stranger.
while leaving I realized who is a near one.
and who is a stranger.
you are the only one who is my own. You are the one who loved me.
l can forfeit lust, angry, attachments.
l can never forget you even if I want to.
your love is bondage.
tell me, can I ever attain salvation?
you don't know what you are for me now.
how my heart melts when I look at you!
time passes by.
the day sets in and the night follows.
I was sleeping during the day woke up when the night came. I was sleeping then.
I was sleeping during the day woke up when the night came. I was sleeping then.
now why do you look for the sun.
you silly, the sun has already set.
the age old river of love has already flown away.
why do you care for it now?
time passes by.
the day sets in and the night follows.
when a small lamp shines in the dark night.
though small, the old traveller uses its light to toddle ahead.
time passes by.
the day sets in and the night follows.
say your name. - I am Vijay Nath.
your clan? - Kashyap.
I am praying for my father's salvation.
I am praying for my father Mr. Kailash Nath's salvation.
what do I know, what is salvation?
don't use this excuse with me.
you taught me how to live.
now don't leave me alone like this. - Bhootnath.
Papa, where's my Bhootnath?
your Bhootnath got salvation, son.
but you said that we are praying for his birthday.
he went away. He went away.
you were right, some things are always left incomplete.
I could never tell father.
I am sorry, son.
I am sorry that your Bhootnath left because of us.
tell him that this house will stay.
and it's yours from today and tell him to forgive me.
the sky is full of stars and.
my eyes are full of tears.
where are you hiding, give me a clue at least.
Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath!
Bhootnath! Bhootnath! - My angel!
Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath!
Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Come down!
Bhootnath!
I can break free from life but not from your love.
I will come in front of you whenever you call for me.
but don't tell this to anyone. - okay. - Okay?
come here.
you too don't tell anyone about this.
Hey, listen up, my buddy. Let's have some fun.
a little mischief, a little devilry. Something fishy.
Hey, listen up, my buddy. Let's have some fun.
a little mischief, a little devilry. Something fishy.
nobody does it better! No, no, no, no, no, no.
nobody does it better!
nobody does it better! No, no, no, no, no, no.
nobody does it better!
you are with me, then every moment, day and night.
the magic is with me. tell me, isn't it?
whatever my heart wishes for.
sometimes this and sometimes that.
I say as I please! Tell me, isn't it?
say whatever you please. What is it that is impossible?
you should always keep smiling and stay happy!
whatever you will wish will happen!
nobody does it better! No, no, no, no, no, no.
nobody does it better!

we Need To Get The Fourth Vote.
it's All Dan
again. Announcer: So They Approached Libra With A Plan.
if We Get Dan's Vote. That's The Number One Thing. Announcer: And She Went To Work.
I Wanted To Talk To You, Could Be A Split.

it's Not Good When The Whole House Votes.
at Least I Know I'm More Liked Than Libra Was.
Bye. I Wasn't Fully Sure If I Would Have The Four Votes To Evict Keesha.
in The End, It Just Made More Sense To Get Libra Out At This Point.

she Took Out Jessie.
she Deserved To Go Home.

after The First Sentence Of Jerry's Speech My Heart Jumped Into My Stomach Like That.

Julie: That Is Correct.
Congratulations.

this Is Where The Game Begins.
Renny Winning Is The Best Thing For Me.
you Know, It's Perfect, Perfect, Perfect.
couldn't Be Any Better.
I Know I'm Not Going Up.
my Room Is Empty Now.
I May Have To Take A Waterbed Just So I Can Sleep.
Memphis want to Move Into The Hippy Room Where Keesha Sleeps And

discussing The Game Every Day While I'm Upstairs.
I Do Believe Memphis Can Charm Keesha And It Does Make Him A Threat.
good Job, Kiddo.
sucks
smile. It's Not That Bad. It's Just A Game.
there's Absolutely Not A Moment In This House That,
you Know, It's Me And Ollie Without Jerry Appearing Within A Three-minute Period.
it's Sort Of A Relief.
Yeah. You Too?
it's Awesome Awesome.
we Could Easily Make A Run For This Game.
I'm Tired.
I Know You Are.
want To Lay Down With Me?
Yeah.
do You Think They Think They're Going Up?
I Hope So, Renny's Going To Take It Out On Jerry For Everything He's Done To People.
first of all, he put up Renny in the first week.
secondly, He Obviously Made A Disgrace Of Himself.
I'm Letting It All Come Out
that's If I Get Put Up Against Him.
he would Better Watch Out.
you And I Need To At Least Talk To Her Tonight
say,"you Know What, Renny, You need to play this game for you?"
yeah I Agree.
I Just Really Hope She Puys Me Up Against Jerry. April's Right.
we Need To Do What We Possibly Can To Get Jerry On The Block.
if She Or Myself Were To Go Up,
it Would Be Better Off If We Were To Go Up Against Jerry.
you Just Got To Play The Game And Don't Let The Game Play You.
Yeah.
I Came Here To Play.
game On, How's It Going?
good.
can You Wash This?
Yeah.
I'd Wash The Pillow Cases, But Not All Of It.
look, It's Getting Washed.
what's The Story, Keesha?
I Don't Know.
are You Not Going To Put Up April?
no. I'm Just Thinking.
I Don't Know If He Promised You Something In The End.
no, No.
because I Know You Like Him.
I Do.
right Now I'm Trying To Get People On My Side.
he Wouldn't Take You To The End.
because He Couldn't Win Against You.
so He Wouldn't Take You.
I Don't Know Anybody In Here That Would Take Me To The End.
I'd Take You.
Yeah. But You're The Only One.
and You Know How I Feel About You, So
Keesha Has A Friendship With Memphis And She Fought Hard To Keep Him In The Game.
however, I'm Not A Stupid Person By Any Means.
I Can See A Lot That's Going On.
Memphis Is A Threat Though.
he Is.
it's His.
he's A Good Player.
I Agree With That.
he Would Use People To Get What He Wants.
Memphis Wants To Win The Money. He's Like April.
he's The Male April.
but He's Quiet About It, Renny Worries Me.
she's On This Kick And I Don't Want Renny To Put Memphis Up.
Renny Needs To Keep Her Targets On One Side Of The House.
I'm Telling You, I'm Keeping My Eye On Him...
there's No Reason To Keep Him Around
does Anybody Want To See My Hoh Room?
this Key Around My Neck Means I'm Going To See My Parents.
I'm So Close To Them.

it's A Dream Come True.
I'm Going To See My Mother and father first.
Oh, Mama!

I'm Sorry. These Guys Are Mean To You.
you Treat Her Like Crap.
Holly's My Poodle.
she Was On The Bed I Chose The First Day That I Walked Into The "Big Brother" House.
Holly's Very Important.
Oh, Hell To The No!
it's No Secret That I'm Not A Big Fan Of April's.
any Time I See April Rattled, It Makes My Day.
I Love It.
punt Her!
get It!
Oh, My God!
Holly Drowned.
Holly Was Beaten, Thrown Into The Jacuzzi And She Landed On Her Neck.
No!
Holly's Done.
if You Were To Pick Between The Two Who's In Worst Shape I Would Definitely Choose April.
what Have You Guys Done To This Poor Thing?
throw Her In The Dryer. She'll Firm Up, For Real.
you Don't Just Throw Her In The Dryer After She's Been In The Hot Tub.
she Needs A Bath-bath.
poor Holly.
you Ever Been In Love?
never.
do You Think Of Me As A Friend?
or Like A Boyfriend?
do I Really Have To Answer That?
I Don't Have To Answer That.
I Don't Want You To Answer It.
I Know The Answer, What?
tell Me. Mr. Know-it-all, Tell Me.
do You Think We Would Continue To Be Friends For Life?
of Course.
I Think That You And I Have A Lot More In Common Than A Lot Of People Think.
like I Look At You Like One Of My Best Friends.
I Have Always Wanted To Marry One Of My Best Friends,
but I Honestly Think Of You As A Best Friend.
is It Bad To Be Sexually Attracted To Your Best Friend?
no.
my Relationship With April Is Far Beyond What Some People May Call A Showmance.
this Is Something Real And Having Something Potentially Outside The House Isn't Out Of The Question Now.
seriously, I'm Not Leaving Your Side When We Get Out Of This.
you Don't Have To.
I'm Sorry. I'm Coming With You.
you're So Cute.
seriously.
I'm Looking Forward To Taking Care Of You.
I Do.

you Know What?
I'm Going To Tell You Right Now,
I Like You, Michelle.
thank You.
I Like You, Too.
you Know You're A Tough Competitor.
Yeah.
OK. But I Still Like You.
what If You Won Hoh Next Week?
would You Put Me Up Or Are You Not Ready To Answer That Hard Question?
I Wouldn't.
what If I Got The Bible Up Here?
would You Swear On It?
Absolutely.
swear On Your Parents?
Absolutely. My Parents Are Very Important. I Don't Do That.
I Haven't Broken My Word In This House At All.
you Know I'm Like Your Mama.
I Wouldn't Throw My Family Under The Bus.
they Are The Most Important People In My Life.
I'm Telling You, I Don't Plan On Putting You Up.
you Are Not My Target At All -- At All.
talking To Michelle, What I Was Trying To Do In That Conversation Was Reel Her In And Have Her Really Start Trusting Me,
but If You Snake Me
do I Look Like A Person That Would Do That?
I'm Just Saying.
what Were You Thinking About Doing?
what will you think about me doing?
I'm Going To Tell You.
april Has A Target In The Back.
well -- You Also Have To Think That's A Twosome Compared To People Playing Solo.
Keesha's My Good Friend But I Sigh What's Going On With The Guys And All.
you Can Only Go By Your Gut And Everything.
you Have Eyes And Ears, You Know?
you Know What's Going On.
I'm Thinking It's Getting To Be Not That Many.
nobody Should Feel Safe. I'll Tell You.
nobody Should.
if You're Not Walking Around On Egg Shells, Something's Not Right.
I Know A Lot Of People Like Me And I'm The Mother And All That.
I Expect To Win The Game.
good Guys can not Finish Last, Right?
Yeah.

I Respect You.
I Really Do.

no. They're Ours.
Ollie Loves His Lolly.
thank Ollie's Afraid Of Birds.
it's Miles Away.
man.
I Never Like Birds.
my Number One Fear In The World Is Birds.
I Think It Goes Back To The Old Albert Hitchcock Movie.
you Got Them Flying In The Backyard And Messing With Us.
leave Us Alone. I'm Just Trying To Live My Life.
anything With Wings, That Big, Scary.
you Wouldn't Be Good In Dinosaur Days.
that's All They Are, Dinosaurs.
they turn to the birds after dinosaur extincted.
really, what's wrong with them?
he's Scared Of Birds.
very.
it's One Of His Biggest Fears.
I Don't Know What The Birds Did Oh Ollie, But Something Went Wrong In His Childhood.
he Ran For His Life When He Saw A Little Crow.
it's A Crow.
Oh, My God.
don't.
how You Doing?
good.
what's Going On?
am I Out Of Danger?
no.
OK.
but What Do You Need From Me This Week?
I May Need You To Go Up As A Pawn.
that's Scary, You Know?
I'm Trying To Go After That Trio In A Way Without Making Too Many Enemies.
I'm Surprised, But You've Got To Do What You've Got To Do.
I'm Thinking Things Through.
I Know You Want To Keep Your Enemies To A Minimum,
but The Thing Is With Me, Memphis And Keesha Off,
you're Guaranteed To Get Rid Of Whoever You Want.
you Only Need Three Votes To Go This Week.
if You Put Me Up, There Is A Definite Risk Of Me Going Home.
it's Just How Much You Trust Me.
if You Don't, Then I Understand.
I Wouldn't Want You To Go Home.
so You're Worried If You Put Up April And Colonel Or April
and Ollie All Three Will Be After You?
Oh, Yeah.
you Know Ollie Is Hooked With April.
I Have To Think It Through.
Hey.
how About Being A Pawn?
get The Hell Out Of Here.
what?
a Pawn For Who?
this Girl's Talking Crazy Now.
I'm Not OK With Being A Pawn For Anybody.
the Biggest "Big Brother" Mistake You Could Ever Make.
it's A Risk.
no, It's A Mistake.
it's Known In "Big Brother" History. The Pawn Always Goes Home.
Oh, Really?
nobody Wants To Be Put On The Block.
no, Not At All.
Ollie, April, The Colonel, That's Three People Hating Me Right There.
if Ollie Or April Went Home,
one Of The Two, I Don't Think Jerry Would Be After You.
does That Make Sense?
who's Jerry Going To Put Up If He Wins Hoh?
me And Dan.
even If He Was On The Block.
you Put Him On The Block And He'd Still Go After Me And Dan.
there's No Way He's Going To Like Me Again.
he Hates Me.
without A Doubt.
well, He Put My Ass On The Block.
Oh, Yeah. That's Right.
Hey. - Hi.
what's Going On?
are You Sitting Here?
do Any Of You Two Want To Be Pawns?
no.
are You Seriously Asking Me That?
I'm Like -- Why?
what's Going On In Your Mind?
that's The Trio.
the Colonel, April And Ollie.
so One Of Them I Want To Go Home.
Renny, I Don't Think Any Of These People In Here Are
we're Not Going To Make A Decision On Who Goes Home.
it Doesn't Matter As Long As One Of Them Goes Home, Too.
what's Going On With Ollie?
I Don't Know What He's Thinking.
can You Go Get Him For Me?
sure.
nobody's Talked Game With Him Since Day One.
neither did I.
I Just Want To Know Where He Is In The Game.
I'm Just Saying.
Hey.
I Hope You Don't Mind Me Asking You.
I Just Want To Know How Much Are You In The Game?
where Are You Standing In The Game Right Now?
what Do You Mean?
like In Other Words, I Know You And April Have A Thing Going, But Where Are You?
I'm Here To Win. I'm Here To Play.
you all Can Go Right Now.
OK.
Thanks, Guys.
I'm Going To Be Dead Honest With You.
you're Putting Me Up Against April.
a Lot Of People -- I'm Not Saying
want To See Her Go?
it's April Left. I'm Not Saying I'm Putting Her Up There.
how Would You Be?
I'm Here To Win.
I'm Not Going To Throw In The Towel.
I Didn't Think So.
hell No.
we're Not Hear To Make A Relationship Out Of It And Have A Showmance.
what Do You Want?
I Want You To Stay In.
basically You're Saying April's The Target This Week.
she Could Be, Yeah.
what Would Be The Main Reason？Because She's A Fierce Competitor.
ain't No Doubt About It.
april Has Money. The Colonel Has Money.
Memphis Has More Than Anybody.
he's Got The Co-op.
you Earn Head Of Household.
they'll Do What I Tell Them To Do.
do You Think?
or Are They Telling You What To Do?
you Do What's Best For You. You Earned Head Of Household. They Didn't.
I Understand April And I -- We Are Two And It's Easy To Get Us Out,
but At The Same Time Colonel Has Done A Lot Of Things To Upset People.
he Upset Dan Last Week,
Michelle, Memphis, Me, April, You, Keesha.
there's Not One Person In The House He Hasn't Done Something Stupid.
if I Put Somebody Up There
there's A Reason For It?
I Have My Eye On Certain People. Believe Me.
do You Know What I Mean?
if I'm Not A Target Why Do I Need To Go Up?
there May Be Bigger Fish To Fry.
it's Your Call.
one Of My Duties As Head Of Household Is To Nominate Two People For Eviction.
at This Point I'm Very Concerned About Nominations.
for Renny To Put Up Someone On Our Side Of The House As A Pawn Is A Huge Mistake.
that's The One Thing About The Darling From New Orleans.
she Is A Crazy -- You Don't Know What She's Going To Do.
I'm Obviously Expecting To Be Put Up This Week.
they Would Be Stupid If They Didn't.
it's Hard To Swallow Because I Am Such A Nice Person.
I'm Worried About Nominations.
me Being Attached To April Is Not Playing Out Well In My Corner.
I'm At More Risk Than Anybody In The House Because April Is The Number One Target.
Renny Is Talking About Maybe Putting Memphis Up.
I Love Renny To Death, But Her Thinking Sometimes Is Just Completely Off The Wall.
if Renny Puts Me Up As A Pawn It's A Mistake On Her Part.
unless You Want Me As An Ebb My Don't Put Me Up As A Pawn.
I Want My Nominations To Shake Up The House A Little Bit.
it's Going To Start Taking Out Strong Players.
nobody's Going To Make Decisions For Me.
it's Time For The Nomination Ceremony.
this Is The Nomination Ceremony And My Duty As Head Of Household Is To Nominate Two People.
I'm Going To Start Off By Handing Someone The Key.
this House Guest Is Safe From Eviction.
Dan, You Are Safe.
Thanks, Renny.
Keesha, You're Safe.
Ollie, you are safe.
Thanks, Renny.
Memphis, You're Safe.
thank You, Renny.
I Nominated You, April, And You, Jerry.
april, The Reason I Nominated You Is Because You Are The Most Tough Cookie Woman I Have Ever Met.
in This Game You're A Big Threat.
Jerry, From Day One, You Did Put Me On The Block.
and For This, I'm Going To Have To Do The Same To You.
with This Said, This Nomination Ceremony Is Adjourned.
Renny Should Have Nominated April And Ollie.
I Don't Know What Renny Is Thinking Right Now.
the Colonel Put Me Up On The Chopping Block The First Week.
so It Was Pay-back Time For Making My Life Hell For Eight Days.
it's Not A Good Feeling To Be Nominated.
man, They Turn On You In One Second.
my Attitude Is Big Boys Don't Cry.
I'm Going To Try And See How I Can Work Through This Thing This Week And Survive Again.
I'm Very Excited That She Did Not Place Me Up Against Ollie. Now She Did Put Me Against
I Hope People Will Start Seeing Jerry The Floater And My Best
hope Is To Get Him To Blow Up On Somebody.
announcer: Who Will Get The Power Of Veto And Will They Use It To Save April Or Jerry?
Oh, fudge, I overlapped my cross stitch.
don't move! - Stay quiet!
our father in heaven asks us to share testimonies
of his righteousness.
I truly believe this church will be
like manna to a starving people.
peg? Thank you. - Okay.
Ahem. Uh, today...
my testimony is that we have a new endeavor.
a casino.
and it's going to be a big success.
and I know this to be true. Amen.
<i- > - - all: Amen.
I know that this church is a place
where people can feel at home.
even if they don't know yet where their true home is.
I know I hurt my family by my actions.
and my...
disseminations.
and I hope they can find it in their hearts
to forgive me.
where is Roman Grant? - We don't know where he is.
we haven't seen him in six weeks.
you're lying. - I am not lying.
not upstairs. - Tell us where he is!
I don't know where he is! He could be in Mexico!
he could be anywhere!
thanks for coming.
if you and Scott were sealed in our church,
it would mean so much to your father.
we're talking it over.
we're just-- we're not sure if it's right for us.
Scott mentioned he wanted to check out a united church of Christ.
Uh-huh.
I-- I hear they're very progressive.
I have to go pick him up because his truck's in the shop.
okay.
okay. - All right.
morning.
what are you doing?
I'm watching birds.
is that right?
I've never seen you before.
Yeah, I'm just down here for a few days on business.
Margie, after dinner, these are the parking lots I want you to leaflet.
I will, bill, but I'm swamped. Aren't there people to pay to do this?
they'll just throw the fliers away, say they did it
and pocket the cash.
Joey, it's Bill. We're opening up our casino in three days.
I don't know if you're in Arizona or where you are.
I wish we could get past this bad blood.
I wish you and Wanda could drive up from Arizona and be there.
give me a call when you get this.
I need to run to the uniform company and explain
that we want a more modest look like this with the longer sleeves.
this other business, it just
it looks like a cocktail waitress.
honey, is this the latest seating count?
this is it? These buses are only half full.
people don't necessarily plan in advance, Bill.
let's not worry about it yet. - The ad is on!
bill, the commercial-- it's running!
man on TV: Blackfoot magic casino!
food! Family fun! - Woman: Entertainment!
genuine casino gaming! Where can you be you?
come join us.
just 85 minutes from salt lake city
near Franklin, Idaho,
Blackfoot magic casino and family fun center.
woman: Grand opening this Wednesday. - Fancy-free!
dad, you gotta come! They came to take mom away.
I don't know a thing!
I am not involved in any conspiracy!
well, I'm starting to find that difficult to believe.
<i- > - Why can't you leave us alone?
LD on! What's going on here?
you've questioned her three times. You've drug her downtown.
now I'm getting fed up with you guys harassing us for no good reason.
Oh, we've got a reason. - Oh, yeah?
there was a raid on Juniper creek.
her father has been signing checks
and depositing them into a bank account in her name.
that's not possible!
I haven't spoken to my mother or father in two months.
here's the account: Bank of Emprim,
nicolette Eugenia Grant. Is that you or is that not you?
no, it's my name, but I don't know anything about that account.
so that's not your signature on file?
that's not your driver's license.
that's on file from when the account was opened?
I don't know. Bill, help me here.
we're not downtown.
this is my private property,
if that still has any meaning in this country.
unless you've got a warrant, there's the front door.
and tell us again just what your interest is here, Bill.
my wife and I are extremely close to miss Grant.
let's just stop beating around the bush.
let's just acknowledge that she's your spirit wife.
my what? - You're polygamists.
I hope you're taping this word for word.
I've known this woman her whole life.
I was born in Juniper creek.
I had her come and nurse my wife back from cancer.
we helped her out, we care for her deeply
and I will not see her abused or her rights violated.
get off of it. We all know what the score is here.
yeah? Then try and prove it in court.
I will not allow them to keep persecuting us like this.
we pay taxes. We fight for our country.
as long as our faith in principle makes us weak
in the eyes of the law, we will be vulnerable.
for Pete's sake, what happened?
Roman's back from wherever he's been hiding.
he's been putting money in an account in Nicki's name.
look, I'll call mama. - No, don't use the phones.
what? Don't look at me. I didn't open it.
I don't know a thing! - We didn't say we thought you did anything wrong.
you're suspicious.
I'm not blind. I can see it in your eyes.
fine, I give up. I don't know what more I can do.
Nicki? Nick! Come back here.
we're not gonna be divided. We're all on the same team.
now we are moving heaven and earth to open this casino and we're all on edge,
but we are gonna make it through this.
Hi. Is it safe now?
what are you doing? - Ah!
clearing out. Your father's back.
where? Since when?
I don't know. There was a mad search for him today by the F.B.I.
and if he's here, we're not safe.
no no no no no no.
he'll make no immediate move against us,
not with a federal warrant hanging over his head.
stay put. Keep working the accounts.
once the trustee arrives all funds will be frozen。
and our hands will be tied.
where have you been?
out.
I took a walk.
a hike.
Oh.
Oh, the 10-minute sale is happening, and it's in my hour.
it is my agate and sterling bracelet, and for the next 10 minutes,
it's only $17. 99.
that's right, for $17. 99, you
I'm sorry, that's $29. 99.
for $29. 99, you can have my beautiful...
Yeah, I made a little slip-up.
Slip-up?
that was awkward, it was embarrassing.
and it was amateurish. We work on tight margins.
that is not something we can make up in volume.
I know. I'm so sorry. I'm really so sorry.
this is not what I want to be seeing.
you've been distracted lately and it's showing.
I'm fine. We're opening another business,
my husband and I, and it's about to be up and running.
this business is the only business you have time for.
I understand-- I do
and I have a plan how I'm going to pass off my other responsibilities.
let's hope that works then.
I try not to stick my nose into the personal lives of my girls,
but I have seen a lot of people with a lot of promise
burn out right around this very stage.
I am not going to burn out.
you have no idea how much this means to me, Beverly.
good. That's the Margene we hired.
cute sweater.
I'm back.
I sold the four napes.
no one wanted the smaller other kind.
worthless clit.
try as you might to avoid 'em.
you always gonna wind up with
a couple of stinking worthless clitorises.
why do you call them that?
that's what they're called.
that's what the natives in Mexico call them.
here's your cut.
now can you run and get me those extra locks?
gram, if grandpa's really back,
you can't just hide inside all day - And buy more locks. - You don't know him.
he's angry. He's-- he's calling.
he's... Tryin' to get me.
let me tell dad.
we can get a restraining order.
you don't know a thing about marriage.
just puree the gruel.
and feed the birds outside before you leave.
I gotta get this room cleaned up.
I got some new ones coming in.
where are you getting all these birds from anyway?
swap meets.
where else?
thank you.
<i- > - Well, she's looking forward to it.
it was the school. The center sent over your test results.
did I place into the eighth grade?
no, honey.
seventh?
I'm sorry.
I'm not in junior high?
no.
you're in senior high.
you tested one full grade ahead.
in math, you're 12th grade.
you're a math whiz.
so we'd better step on it-- new dresses.
senior high starts one full week earlier.
the management company has trained enough workers
to go from 9: 00 a. M. To 11: 00 p. M.
and three weeks from now, we'll be able to staff 24/7.
I got the buses ready to extend till midnight when we do.
toilets were finally installed yesterday,
and we just passed inspection.
I can't believe it's just a temporary space.
that's right, Jerry.
and the tents are just a promise of bigger things to come.
we might have a problem.
what is it? - You.
me? - The F.B.I. Just called.
they're sending an agent to our tribal offices.
they implied you might be using our accounts to launder funds.
they want to see the ledgers for any transfers we might have made
to Mexico on your behalf.
whoa whoa whoa. Jerry, I'm being harassed.
the feds and the F.B.I. are no friends of mine right now,
and I'm sure you of all people understand.
one of the reasons my father chose you
is you made a promise
not to bring Vegas-style problems to our reservation.
we thought you were the sunny face of polygamy.
what's this all about?
it's about the mess that Roman Grant left behind.
and I give you my word, my hands are clean.
bill, we can't be in bed with a partner who's involved in criminal activity.
maybe you should remain a silent partner and not show up for the opening.
just a sec. Hold on.
who made the miracle in the desert happen for you guys? I did.
no one else could have gotten those tents up this fast.
we needed the money; it was my idea and we're partners.
send the F.B.I. To me. I'll take care of 'em.
is that it?
actually,
there's another problem we'd like to discuss.
crab legs?
Yes, crab legs. And I stand by it.
it wasn't Jerry. It was his son Tommy, right?
what did he say? - He didn't say anything.
why on earth can't they just talk to me about it?
is that too much to ask?
honey, we're guests up there, and we need to be careful
not to step on anybody's moccasins.
I was as diplomatic as I could be.
Oh, and I resent that. I resent that look.
they wanted baked salmon served at the opening.
well, the salmon used to be a pretty important fish in Idaho.
well, I'm sure it was, but Mormons don't like salmon.
we like crab legs. And if it's an all-you-can-eat
with a "kids eat free" sign, well...
we are in like Flynn.
honey? - Nobody in Utah eats salmon. That's all I'm saying.
honey, this isn't just about salmon.
you've got to take it a little slower.
are we a Mormon-friendly casino or not?
that was the idea. - Then I'm just doing my job.
and if the most that they have to worry about is crab legs,
well, then they must lead a very charmed existence,
don't you think?
Margie, please,
you need to spend a little more time up there.
Jerry asks about you constantly and as you can see
I think that Barb is doing a super in Bill.
and you know, this is so important for her after her ex-communication.
she needs this for her self-esteem.
you need to support her. - Margene!
we need this casino.
it's our financial security.
and she's a diamond in the rough, Bill.
a diamond in the rough. - Maybe, but we need this.
that's it. Do we understand each other?
Mm-hmm.
I wasn't expecting to see you.
I want you to call off the dogs.
what dogs would you be referring to, Bill?
it has become your personal vendetta and we both know it.
I don't know what mess you're in now,
but I'm quite sure it's of your own making.
my family's being pilloried and we're innocent.
is that so? Roman grant disappears the night before his planned arrest.
other than my office,
you're the only one that knows that's about to happen.
Yeah, and I wanted to see him put in jail more than anyone.
just tell me-- what's it gonna take to get you off our backs?
nothing ends until Roman grant is arrested.
is that how you save your pride?
going after a woman and her children?
if you're still standing there the next time I turn around,
I swear I will have you arrested.
I like it. - Thank you, bishop Pettis.
I just had to hear it to be sure.
you've got the gig.
there was little comment from the bureau, however,
except to say that there's substantial evidence
that Grant continues to use funds
from the compound's web,
which, as you know, Maria,
has been placed into the hands of a state-appointed trustee
because of grant's fugitive status,
which renders him unable to properly oversee
the assets in the $200 million trust.
the new trustee convenes a first meeting tomorrow,
which of course...
bill, enough. Go on.
in a minute. I'm just prepping for the hearing tomorrow.
well, fine, do it at Nicki's.
you can't keep sitting over here and avoiding her like this.
honey, just go on.
it's her night.
it's not right punishing her for what's happening
well, do you believe her?
about being in touch with her parents? I do,
because I choose to believe her.
huh.
great.
and I take no pleasure in this.
I'm just gonna ask,
just to know where we are in this family,
and I know it's certainly none of my business
honey, what?
did-- have you and Nicki repaired your relationship?
we're still trying to work things out.
no, I mean, have you...
repaired it yet?
no, we're not there yet.
you can't blame me for asking.
just go over there and see her.
bill: I'm not going over there tonight. - Barb: Go.
no, we're not there yet.
morning. - Morning, Benny.
we got the gig.
we're playing at the singles ward social next Friday.
Oh, that's wonderful, honey.
no, mom, it's a big deal. It's our first paying performance.
I think that's really great, Benny.
Margie, could you call Nicki
and tell her and Cara Lynn that breakfast is ready?
and I am gonna need that extra dozen.
okay, sweetheart. I love you too.
that was Teenie. She says hello.
she'll call you later to arrange picking her up next week.
<i- > - She's not answering.
shake a leg.
what's going on here? - Bill.
Nicki inside? - No, she's not here,
and I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
next time use the front door,
because this is called trespassing.
what Nicki is doing is called kidnapping.
don't talk to him, Bill! Don't listen to a word he says!
you don't know what he is capable of.
all I want is my daughter.
she is going to go to school and that's that.
she's very smart. She's gifted.
that is not your decision to make.
now I gave you a few extra days and you start hanging up on me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Nicki, you expressly told me you'd worked all this out.
he just wants to place her.
he wants to put her in the joy book.
is that true? - Absolutely not.
she's my daughter. I just want to see her.
she's enrolled in school. It starts this week.
now wait one minute. You waltz back into her life after 12 years,
and you think you're gonna make decisions without my consent?
he still wants me.
he still loves me, Bill. We have to be on guard at all times.
we have to be vigilant. - Honey, that's enough.
Nicki, I want you to go in the house.
no. - Go in the house and let us talk.
just go and have breakfast.
I don't know what it is, but she just gets me going.
but I know you're having your own problems too.
I'm not gonna talk about Nicki with you.
we'll work this out amicably.
neither of us can have the law involved in this dispute.
if you deal square with me, I'll deal square with you.
daddy?
honey. You were supposed to be back four days ago.
you had me worried. - I know.
I just wanted the chance to go to school, papa.
that's all.
I just didn't know how to tell you.
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
honey, I'll put you back in school if that's what you want.
how about weekends?
we'll make sure you get her every weekend,
and Nicki will hold to the bargain.
all right.
thank you.
I just want a chance to get to know my more a little bit better too.
I don't really like it here.
don't worry. When you go back to Kansas,
I'll go with you.
and I told you I'd be here just as quick as a cricket.
Oh, boy.
how pretty are you?
what's on your mind, my dear?
I was wrong
in attempting to hasten your demise
which in the end I just could not do.
it's worth remembering.
why don't you lean on over here
and give your love-starved husband a kiss?
Ahh!
I am not a fool, Frank.
I could smell your goon squad a mile away.
you don't think for one second that I would ever try
to harm a hair on your chinny chin chin, do you?
I brought them to protect me!
boy.
we are going to be civilized
and...
gonna go get some ice-cream cones...
reacquaint ourselves with each other
and see if, over time,
there might still be something
meaningful in our marriage.
I would hope for nothing more than that.
and then...
you're gonna bring me right back here
and let me out.
do we understand each other?
always.
then drive.
the rest of the mums have been delivered to the warehouse
and the grower's renting his van.
I'm picking them up at 4: 00 a.m.
so when I get to the casino, I'll have plenty of time to cut them.
Marge, could you call Jerry or Tommy
and check on the available number of unsold seats on the bus?
no, why don't you?
I'd just rather you do it.
barb. - Okay, because I'm finding it
to be a petty bac k-biting environment up there.
I mean, they're-- they're fearful.
I think they're sexist. - Oh no, Barb.
well, they're certainly anti-mormon. - I really don't think so.
then they just don't like me.
all right, that's right. That's it.
I know it is.
I-- I just
I just don't know what I'm doing up there.
why am I putting myself through all this torture?
you're so good at it, Barb.
I could never do everything that you're doing.
you just need to spend more time up there.
think about what a great role model you're gonna be
for young girls everywhere. It's so important.
Margie, just stop.
you're blossoming. - No.
you're blossoming, Margie.
the fact is I'm just drifting.
no, you're just changing, is all. We all are.
we're all just changing.
I told Bill I was prepared to meet Kenny up at the airport,
drive him up, but Bill said he felt more comfortable hiring a car.
well, heaven forbid we should upset Bill.
what? I'm just stating the obvious.
forgiveness is a commodity
that's pretty hard to come by in this family.
under the circumstances,
Nicki, I'd say we've been very forgiving.
Nicki, I know that you and Bill will be able
to reestablish intimacy really really soon.
what? - Don't you even try and go there with me.
I know you had the gall to ask Bill,
and I know he had the colossal gall to tell you
because I heard you.
Oh. - Great.
I'm so glad my intimate relationship with Bill
is such a fascinating topic of conversation between the three of you.
you know what? I'll certainly keep you two posted
if and when something develops.
it's okay, Nicki. - No, it most certainly is not okay!
I'm terribly sorry. It just came up in conversation.
and don't get mad at me. I have been carrying the brunt.
I have been picking up your share, believe me.
Margene! - Not that I mind.
mama.
please don't hang up on me.
Nicki, I am so deeply remorseful
for all our recent acrimony.
what are you doing calling me?
honey, it's an emergency!
we've had a blackout down here.
mama, I have been accused of opening a secret account for papa.
you tell me what's going on.
my food reserves are melting, the air-- I can't breathe.
I desperately need you to go get a generator
from your husband's store and bring it to me asap.
No! I mean, I'm being drug into the middle of all your criminal activity.
are you aiding and abetting papa?
please, I'm begging you, Nicki.
I'm desperate, please.
please go get me a generator!
as the official stat e-appointed trustee,
I want to assure everyone that we are sensitive
about your fears of the state intruding into your affairs.
this is an illegal interference of a know-nothing government
that thinks it knows everything!
I pledge to you-- I bring no hidden agenda.
I'm a senior partner at cromwell, Ashe,
I've chaired the Professional Conduct Committee
of the Utah association of C.P.A.S,
and I'm guided by an advisory panel
comprised of men and women with strong connections
to your community.
we're not here to take des.
I come from Juniper creek.
our only purpose is to administer to the trust
in the best interest of you, the beneficiaries in the community, period.
this is an illegal, gestapo-like invasion
to destroy us because of our religious beliefs.
the state is using the pretext of a trustee
to get its hands on our assets.
excuse us, won't you? Alby?
why don't you get onboard?
now we are going to drag the compound
into the 21st century whether you like it or not.
don't pretend you're a friend of Juniper creek.
you're a Judas.
I know you're the mastermind behind this trustee thing,
behind the raids.
I'm a victim of the raids. - I know your game.
you will never be prophet.
I have no taste for prophets.
I chased your father from this compound, and I've got news for you:
he's a far tougher man than you.
at least we can talk.
Dale, you got a sec?
Dale, this is Albert Grant,
Roman's second in command. It's fair to refer to you as that?
that would be a fair representation, I suppose. Nt,
it's a pleasure to meet you.
Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming!
when the chips are really down, there you are.
I'm not hooking this up until you tell me what's going on.
goodbye. - No, don't leave me!
why are you screaming at me? What is going on?
well, you can't drive back on an empty stomach.
I'll make you a b. L.T! Bacon.
I need some bacon. - Mama, I don't want a sandwich.
I'm not hungry. - Yes, I want to make you a sandwich.
just-- just go down into the cellar
and get me some bacon from the walk-in.
please let me make you a b. L.T!
just get the bacon!
get me bacon, please!
I didn't know how to tell you.
how could you have sent me in there when you knew?
your father's dead. The prophet's dead.
you're gonna have to face that fact.
all right, let's just sit down calmly
and try to think things out.
Oh, honey, this is a real pickle.
no, this does not make sense.
why is he in the freezer? - Because he's dead.
did you kill him? - No!
how dare you? I walked into his bedroom
to celebrate his return from banishment,
and there he was with his guitar.
Oh, your beautiful father, probably in the midst
of singing his beloved "canciones Mexicana's,"
apparently struck dead by joy in the middle of his prime.
what else could I do? He said he was going to live to 126.
I had to protect his image from being tarnished
I had to think about his legacy.
well, who knows? - Not a single soul, - And don't you tell anybody. - We have to turn him over to the f. B.I.
you can't ask me to do that. I won't!
mama, do you know what trouble this has brought down on bill and my family?
my marriage is on the line. - Well, I'm a widow!
we are all gonna wind up in jail. I mean, papa's in the freezer?
you can't keep him there forever. - Well, I won't turn him over.
you can't make me. - You have to-- now!
no, I don't. I won't.
<i- > - - lura: Ow!
I couldn't stop her, father. She bit me.
Papa's dead.
what?
he is dead, Alby. He's really really dead.
are you sure?
are you 100% sure?
no, you be sad!
it's very very sad!
mama's had him in the freezer for weeks. She refuses to give him up.
she killed him? - No, she found him dead.
he died. She was afraid of telling the cops.
she's gone half crazy. - How do you know she didn't kill him?
how do I know you didn't kill him? - Maybe Bill killed him.
maybe he didn't. I can't take it. I'm going home.
you just go over there and fix it.
his death has to be announced and she won't listen to me.
at long last!
shall we, darling?
my destiny is fulfilled...
and god will surely punish he who blocks my path to glory.
I've opened up other businesses in my day,
but none have filled me with the pride and humility
I feel standing before you at this moment.
I know your people were at the forefront
of the ghost dance movement of the last century,
struggling to assert your identity
against an overwhelming invasion by a foreign culture.
well, I believe in my heart
tomorrow's opening of this casino
offers us all a second chance for self-determination,
and in some small way may right some of the wrongs that history has left us.
how long do you think it will take him to defrost?
a dressed deer can take a day or two.
how long will it take you, dear papa?
maybe never...
for your heart is made of ice.
will you stop talking to him?
it frightens me.
did you see that? - What? What?
he just gave me a mean look
because he knows I'm gonna be the prophet now.
Oh! Frank!
S-stop. Don't.
you-- you know you don't want this.
now don't resist.
I don't want to hurt you. - No.
<i- > - I just want to kill you.
Oh! Ow!
my hip. My hip.
I don't give a goddamn about your hip.
I've got no sympathy for you.
Oh, my back!
Oh, my hip is out.
what the fuck is with all these birds, Lois?
Frank, you know I don't like that language.
when will you let me live
let me live in peace
for a percentage of,
uh, a neat little business I've got going?
what kind of little business?
selling birds to pet shops.
I buy 'em for $30
and I sell 'em for $700.
where do you get 'em for $30?
that's my little girl.
you're just the little smuggler, aren't you, Lois?
I am a purveyor of birds.
that's all you need to know.
now do we have a deal or not?
hmm.
this is Bill. - Man: Mr. Henricson,
it's Smiley from Lumber.
you said to call you if I accidentally stepped on any toes - Or ran into any problems. - Yeah, smiley, what's up?
there's a problem.
huge problem! Huge!
Kenny's flight was delayed so he didn't make his connection.
his equipment arrived, but what if
what if he's late?
I just knew it was too good to be true.
he's dead, Barb. Oh no, Bill! Don't
no no no no! Don't touch him. Don't touch him.
Oh, dear lord. - What are you looking at?
No! No, don't look. Don't let her see it. - Barb: Nicki, stay there!
what is it? - No, please please, Nicki!
it's okay.
that miserable, rotten, son of a
Nicki, sweetie, don't go there.
it was Alby. - Alby killed him?
No! He dumped him here. He's setting us up.
what? - He's been dead for weeks.
you knew about this?
<i- > - No, I
Yeah, what's up, Jerry?
what do you mean an anonymous tip?
No! No! Jerry, I'll be right there.
where are we going? - Should you call the police or the F.B.I?
they're already on their way.
it's my family, Bill. I can handle it.
just let me take care of it.
how long have you known? - Since yesterday.
mama called. She had him in the freezer. I told Alby to deal with it.
I'm just trying to save us from all this!
everyone stop! You wait here till I get back.
you and you-- Marge, you come and keep an eye
on Ben and Cara Lynn,
and Barb, you-- you come with me.
smiley, make sure no one comes close to this spot.
and throw a tarp over it.
the F.B.I. Boise field office received an anonymous tip
that Roman Grant is at the casino.
and we told them it wasn't credible.
well, it wasn't. - We've stalled them,
but we're not gonna hold them at bay forever.
and a swat team is not something we want running around at our opening.
come on, they'd handle a crank call like this by sending in a swat team?
he's on the "10 most wanted" list.
they faxed us this.
and apparently he's your father-in-law.
this is some kind of hoax. You give me an hour
to find out who's making these anonymous calls,
and I'll personally talk to the f. B. I. And tell them who to swat.
and that's a promise. Come on. - No, gentlemen,
in the same spirit of full disclosure
and airing issues just face to face rather than through third parties,
if you've got problems in the future with me,
my decisions or my decision-making,
I invite you to share them with me...
personally.
so... There.
good grief, Barb, not the time or place.
anybody come around? - No one.
but that lady just went down into that pit and lost it.
Nick, what are you doing?
stop. - Please just let me fix it!
stop! - Please.
I wanted to take care of it without worrying you.
that's the reason I didn't tell you.
you're not thinking straight. What were you gonna do?
I'm gonna take him into the desert and you'll never see him again.
and you'll never see me again either.
no, stop it! That's not what we're gonna do.
I'm still shaking. I am still shaking.
Where's Bill?
he left with Nicki to take our little problem back from whence it came,
but he's left us in charge until he gets back.
barb, I don't know how to say this without you getting worried
Kenny's manager just called
and Kenny's plane is now being diverted to spokane
on account of a forest fire in Boise.
a forest fire?! - Shh.
what? - Calm down.
what are we gonna do?
are those my crab legs?
they need to be on ice.
they're in styrofoam. - This is intentional.
barb, don't go there. I need you to concentrate. Don't go there.
come here. Kenny! - I got it.
all right.
Ben, take care of Cara Lynn.
do you want a cold burger?
no.
fry?
you've been driving for a long time. You should eat something.
I'll mix you some fry sauce.
Papa's dead.
a long time for a gaming environment... - Where are they?
Oh, I can't stand this.
you're gonna have to go on, Barb.
No!
Oh.
barb, Ben's all set and ready to go.
this is about more than just stage fright.
this is about moving on with your life.
o heavenly father...
and now a word from our partner in this endeavor.
bill Henricson is someone who had a vision
of a family-friendly casino,
and the perseverance to make it happen.
on behalf of weber gaming,
in partnership with the Blackfoot people,
we would like to welcome you
to this-- this new kind of casino experience.
um, we have a very special opening act for you tonight,
and we hope you are enjoying those crab legs.
well, let the gaming begin!
you've got the story? You know what to tell her?
Nicki. - Sorry we missed it.
Where's Barb?
she's in the back counting up the take.
are you all right? - Mm-hmm.
so how did it go? - Ben's band played.
he was great. - Don't sugarcoat it.
it went okay-- I mean, I think.
and Barb?
ask her yourself.
just a moment. Just put it right there.
thank you.
come on.
tonight we share a new beginning.
tonight a ghost that has haunted us all through these years
has passed...
and we are truly free.
gentlemen. Partners. Congratulations.
no, no, the insider trading charges were dropped.
very expensive lawyer. - She was a wonderful nanny...
until she was deported.
Whoa!
do you think they're gonna hear us?
only if we keep doing it right.
what?
I forgot to tell you -- You need to speak to Cameron.
she dropped out of school last week.
if we did it like this when we were married, we might still be married.
or just very, very tired.
ceo Reveal Cosmetics
geez.
anybody ever told you about seconds?
Hey, huge, here's a little tip for you
next time, two trips.
think of the second one as cardio.
Hector. - Mr. Brody.
Where's the shrimp?
I'm sorry, Mr. Brody. We're out of shrimps.
what do you mean you're out of the shrimp?
people wait a whole year for this shrimp.
Yes, but -- - no, no, no. What are you telling me?
that the dish I wait 12 months for is no longer available because "the human planet" over there decided to build the Mayan pyramids out of shellfish.
the shrimps -- they're for your wife, Mr. Brody?
can you hook a brother up?
there may be some left in the lower kitchen.
I'll run it down to the pool at once.
you are the man, Hector.
Hey, babe.
your shrimp are on the way.
if you're happy, I'm happy.
founder Alpha Crisis Management
I'm sorry, sweetie, but I told you
after the barbecue I need to get right to the office.
no, it's a crisis.
distribution mixed up our shipments of Viagra and chewable vitamins.
Yeah, boys all through the Midwest are getting...
spontaneous erections.
so, don't wait up, okay?
french toast for breakfast sounds great.
of course I love your french toast.
you know I'm always honest with you.
okay, bye.
God, this is the first and last time I'm having an affair.
ceo Devotion Pharmaceuticals
your wife's a very lucky woman, sir.
thanks for meeting me. - My pleasure.
so, tell me
since my Christmas bonus.
thank you for that, by the way
I hope it won't be awkward running into eh other here.
why would it be awkward?
we see each other at the office every day.
because I'm letting you go.
what? And the board?
the board doesn't know yet. Nobody does.
but when I present my reorganization plan tomorrow, they won't have any choice.
you'll land on your feet, James.
that's why I hired you in the first place.
Oh...
since you're new here, make sure you try the shrimp.
it's one of life's true pleasures.
golden Boy Amerimart Industries
soon-to-be-former Golden Boy Amerimart Industries
there you are.
Hey.
Hey, the kids were looking for you.
come here.
it's good to see you.
everything okay? - Yeah, yeah.
what did he want?
Oh, you know, just -- just work stuff.
work stuff? Today?
Yeah, you know, quarterly reports.
s. E.C. Poking around. The usual.
listen, I'm gonna go find the guys.
I'll meet you and the kids for s'mores later, okay?
okay. - Okay.
that dress still kills me, you know.
Rapido! Rapido! Where's the shrimp?!
Rapido! Es para la esposa de Mr. Brody!
he fired you?
no one knows yet. It won't be official till tomorrow.
he's threatened by you. It's obvious.
you're younger, better-looking, and, worst of all, you got a hotter wife.
Hey, absolutely -- hot-wife envy.
every time Mrs. C.E.O. Stepped out of that show, you were one step closer to the unemployment line.
things change.
when Lisbeth and I were married, she couldn't have been less interested in sex.
but now that we're both single again -- mmm, mommy.
can't keep our hands off each other.
maybe you should remarry her.
Yeah, right.
then sex in the wine cellar becomes "don't touch me. I'm exfoliating.
and what's wrong with you? He feels guilty.
that's right.
because I'm cheating on the saint who plans my breakfasts in advance.
well, it could be worse.
you could be spending your days begging grown men for shellfish.
Hey! Rapido!
that can't be good.
help!
my boss. - My shrimp!
what happened?
I took a shortcut to keep the shrimps cold.
he came out of nowhere. - Call 911.
I'm sure he'll be fine.
you can forget 911.
I think things are suddenly looking up for you, huh, James?
hell of a barbecue.
good morning, sir.
good morning, Susan. - Mr. Walker.
death by golf cart.
I thought the old man was gonna outlive us all.
well, make yourself at home, by the way.
Hey, I'm an exec V. P. Too.
how come I don't get a swivel chair in my office?
probably 'cause the company finds me more valuable than you.
come on. We're late for our friends upstairs.
rumor is that the frontrunner for the C. E.O. job is that jerk from G. E. That hit on me at the sun valley conference.
wait a minute. Didn't you sleep with that guy?
I said he was a jerk, not that he wasn't hot.
I mean, I must sound like a cliche but...
sometimes I wonder if Karl is seeing someone else.
are you, Karl? - Yes.
my staff of 1, 200 employees who count on me each and every day.
and we barely do anything together anymore.
last week I asked Karl to go to the movies
to see "the nanny diaries."
he said he had to work. On a Sunday.
I run a billion-dollar pharmaceutical conglomerate.
people need antidepressants on the weekends, too.
sometimes I just wish he could look at me like he used to.
Karl, as a gesture to Wendy, could you find the time to take her to the movies?
I think this would be a small but important step in repairing this marriage. Marla: I miss your penis.
Karl, could you?
Karl! - Yes. Sorry.
I forgot to switch off my penis -- I mean phone.
no significant accomplishments?
you're being too modest.
you've branded reveal as the industry leader in personal grooming.
Oh, that.
and I'll be honest
I won't leave the house without first applying your toner and blush.
well, I'll be honest
it's working.
that should about do it.
if all goes well, you'll be entrepreneur's cover boy in November.
but I do have one last question.
I'm an open book.
do you spend much time in Yonkers?
YONKERS?
I don't understand. - You see, there are rumors
rumors that might interest your shareholders.
and what kind of journalist would I be if I didn't ask?
I can assure you I haven't been to Yonkers in...
20 years. - That's what I thought.
in any case, since your profile doesn't go to press for another six weeks,
I'll have plenty of time to look into those rumors.
good day, Duncan.
sorry.
what end of the club are you using, man?
sorry, sorry. My instructor says sometimes I break my wrist too soon.
no, Tiger Woods sometimes breaks his wrist too soon.
you just suck.
so, not only am I still employed, they've decided to promote from within.
they're interviewing every upper-level exec for the C. E.O.'S job, including myself.
well, enough about you.
I got real problems.
lady Macbeth wants me to throw her a birthday party at the club next week.
so?
she wants me to plan it to show how much I care about her.
I said, "sweetheart, I did not go to harvard business school to study party planning."
you said that? - No.
that woman tolerates no dissent.
it's like being married to Dick Cheney.
you're late. - I got trouble.
wait, I thought you said you were arrested for a D.W.I.
no, no. That was just my cover for why I needed bail money.
you lied to us.
Karl, we're men.
when it comes to sex, money, or a criminal proceeding, we're allowed to lie.
so, what happened in Yonkers?
I was coming home from a hunting trip.
you don't hunt. - Fine. I was antiquing.
can we just stick to the subject here?
I was getting tired, so I pulled into a truck stop for some coffee to keep me awake for the drive home.
there was a woman there.
dark, beautiful, sexy as hell.
she smiled at me, and we began to talk a little.
don't tell me -- she was a pro.
I was lonely.
one thing led to another, and before I knew it, we we in the men's-room stall for a little business transaction.
why do I feel dirty?
but in the midst of our transaction...
a state trooper stumbled in.
arrested us both.
so, you got pinched for solicitation?
it's not something you want on the resume - but it could have been a lot worse. - Let me finish.
this dark, beautiful woman
well, she was full of surprises.
unfortunately...
her penis was one of them.
you got a knobbier from a tranny?
how do you think I felt? Every inch of her was woman.
she looked like a model.
unfortunately, she was modeling penises.
that's very supportive.
it's just personal preference. When it comes to women, I'm not a penis man.
guys, let's just focus for a second.
if this journalist gets corroboration, it could cost Duncan his job.
you've come to the right guy. This is what crisis management is all about.
first year of law school
if there's no corroborating witness, then it's all hearsay...
until they get ahold of the tranny.
exactly.
you just got to find a way to keep her
or him -- quiet, and you're home free.
the reporter cannot touch you.
track down the tranny.
track down the tranny.
you all right?
this is the place I reserved for Janelle's party this weekend.
if she smells formaldehyde, I'm a dead man.
Mrs. Storrs, I'm James Walker from Amerimart.
I'm very sorry for your loss. - That makes one of us.
uh, I believe this belongs to you. It was left behind at the scene.
apparently my husband found someone more deserving than me.
excuse me.
Hey. - Hey.
but the necklace -- not for the loyal wife.
for the other woman.
probably gave it to her before he died.
son of a bitch. - I know.
guy's worth $40 million and not even a sniff in my direction.
is she okay?
Yeah. You know Stacey. She takes things hard.
when our Springer Spaniel died, she was a mess for...
are you okay?
James? You all right?
Hey, James.
nice wake.
but let's be honest
cash bar? Oh, tacky.
you okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
just got a call from an old friend of mine.
he thinks his wife might be having an affair.
rite of passage for men.
loss of virginity. First threesome.
discovery of the cheating wife.
the trifecta.
you, too? - My second wife, after Lisbeth.
of course, I encouraged her to do it. Spice things up a little.
your friend -- how's he doing?
just trying to breathe.
well, I better run.
I'm off to break bread with a woman who hates me.
your ex? - No, my daughter.
vodka tonic.
that's your third, you know.
I didn't know you were keeping score.
I didn't know you had to get loaded to face your daughter.
you should try facing her. You'd get loaded, too.
look, I appreciate the Cobb salad, Duncan, but I told you
I'm not going back to school.
I mean, your life turned out fine without a degree.
professionally, at least.
dad, okay? Call me "dad," please.
dad was the guy who raised me since I was 8 and died of a stroke last year.
you're biology, Duncan. That's it.
and you don't need to worry about me, okay?
I'll find a decent job. - Really?
what's the market out there for overentitled 19-year-olds with smart mouths?
you know, this has been fun...
in a really not-fun kind of way.
do me a favor. The next time you want to pass judgment, send an e-mail.
so you can reduce me to dna?
God forbid I should open my mouth to you.
sit down.
whatever you think of me, I'm still your father.
fine.
you want to act like my father?
step up to the plate. Prove it.
how?
give me a job.
I -- I think I should get you in touch with my trademarks department.
there are some things you just did we might want to get a patent on.
I'm glad I make you happy.
you deserve it.
can I ask you a question, Karl?
you and your wife...
do you still sleep together?
no. No, I told you -- not in months.
to be honest -- ooh!
after being with you,
I'm not even sure we were doing it right to begin with.
but you still do other things with her, right?
and I love you so much, I want to do those things with you, too.
to tell you the truth, the only thing we do together anymore is couples therapy two mornings a week.
couples therapy? - Yeah.
then that's what I want to do with you.
but... we're not even married.
plus we get along great.
we don't need couples therapy.
Oh. I see how this works.
I do things to you that you've fantasized about since junior high school, but the second I ask for one tiny thing...
let me ask you
how are you gonna like having to call your wife the next time you feel horny, Karl?
I'm not afraid of the hard work, doctor.
uh, Mr. Mixworthy? - Yeah?
a word.
this is highly unorthodox. - Look at her, doctor.
she's an interior designer by trade, but you know what her real skill is?
making a short, insecure, lactose-intolerant man feel like a porn star.
that's very touching -- - I'll double your fee.
done. My contractor's bleeding me dry.
no. No, sweetie.
it's no problem.
okay. I love you, too.
Bye, hon.
I have an MBA, I drive an S-class, and I run a 6-minute mile.
and you know how she judges me as a man?
if I can get her favorite dessert here from a little cafe on the left bank in time for her party this weekend.
till death do you part.
sometimes it just sounds like a threat, doesn't it?
how am I gonna get 500 Napoleons here by this Saturday?
this is it.
classy spot.
Oh, yeah.
I can see how the vending machines would really put a guy in the mood.
so, is she gonna be here?
she told me this was her regular spot and her pimp just promoted he she got promoted to this?
boy, she must have kicked ass at the slaughterhouse.
by the way, you never told me her name.
you hooked up with someone named Dontrelle and for a second didn't think that might be a dude?
that sounds like the middle linebacker.
I told you it was dark.
cause Dontrelle went 6'4," 320, and blocked out the sun.
hold on. Hold on.
there's someone.
Hey. - Hey, yourself.
you boys looking for a good time?
no. I'm married.
I'm done with good times.
actually, we're looking for Dontrelle.
Dontrelle don't work exit 47 no more.
another promotion, perhaps.
do you know where I could find him -- uh, her?
sorry. Can't help you.
I might be able to track Dontrelle down through this old John I know.
tell her to call me at this number, and tell her it's really, really important.
she was that good, huh?
let's just say when it comes to sex...
she's the man.
Hey.
kids are asleep. Florie said that they were angels.
well, you know, I'm kind of tired.
so I think I'm gonna go up, too, okay?
first time I saw you -- freshman year at Madison, econ 101.
Yeah. What's this about?
you walked in.
I was already there, of course, because
I was 15 minutes early everywhere freshman year.
and I thought to myself, "if I could just sit across from that girl and have a cup of coffee, my life would be perfect."
well, you got more than a cup of coffee.
I know.
but my life isn't perfect.
Hey, what's wrong? What
what's going on? Are you nervous about the interview tomorrow?
no, I was just thinking about that first time I saw you and wondering if my boss felt the same way the first time he saw you.
wh-- what are you talking about?
you were sleeping with him.
the necklace you had yesterday -- he gave it to you before he died, didn't he?
don't talk to me like you love me. Just answer me.
I do love you. - Answer me.
were you having an affair with him?
and I'll respect you a hell of a lot more if you tell me the truth.
Yes.
Yes. At least you can't say I'm a liar.
no, I am.
because I don't respect you one bit.
James, James, wait. Let's talk about this.
don't walk out on me. - I may be leaving...
but I'm not the one who walked out.
James, wait!
James, don't go!
market share is up.
the fall campaign has cemented our brand recognition.
we are the darlings of wall street.
sir, aren't you worried about hurting someone?
nonsense.
Adam has it taken care of.
Hey, moron!
sorry! Sorry.
even in success, Reveal must be a leader, not a follower.
you know by the year 2015, the most rapidly expanding population group will be women over 60?
why not make them feel beautiful, too?
why shouldn't women in nursing homes have access to the best foundation and base available?
why not market a line of hair products specifically for wigs?
Really? Cause, actually...
the way to reach seniors is to appeal to the girl in them, - not the old woman. - Excuse me?
come on, Duncan. Everybody knows women don't like to think of themselves as old.
the exception being your last three teenage girlfriends, of course.
I give you a job, I give you responsibility.
Yeah, to get non-fat lattes. - That's not the point.
do you know what a 19-year-old girl would do for an opportunity like this?
no, but I have a feeling you do.
do you want this job, Cam?
Yeah. - Then you need to zip it...
and prove that you belong here.
how?
you'll see.
I want this place in shape by Monday morning or
or what?
I guess you'll find that out Monday morning.
beautiful.
I need to end it... with Marla.
we have nothing in common.
the only books she reads are about the differences between good carbs and bad.
so end it. What's the problem?
how do you break up with a woman who wears underwear like this?
Mr. Walker? They're ready for you now.
has led us to search for his successor.
do you find tragic deaths amusing, Mr. Walker?
no, not usually. But this one -- maybe a little bit.
thank you for your time, Mr. Walker, but we have other candidates waiting.
serious candidates. - Done already, huh?
okay.
I guess I'm not
just -- just one thing.
this company is in trouble, and Walter Storrs knew that when he died.
Amerimart has been an industry leer for nearly half a century.
Hey, look, you might not think that Amerimart will ever falter.
I'm here to tell you that one day you might wake up and realize that while you slept, the ground shifted, and everything you thought was so firm and so solid
guess what -- it's not anymore.
the world is changing so much faster than we are, ladies and gentlemen.
right now, somewhere in a garage, two kids are inventing something that's gonna put us out of business one day.
we shouldn't be ignoring these kids. We should be hiring them.
because you know what they'll call us if we don't?
available office space.
now, I'm sure your dream candidates all have perfect resume, unblemished lives, and have succeeded at everything they've ever done.
but if I were you,
I'd hire someone who knows what it feels like to lose something, because he will never let that happen again.
and now I'll let you get back to your serious candidates.
I wish I hadn't eaten all that bread at lunch.
nothing worse than bad carbs.
if I may...
we've had quite an adventure, you and I, but like every great adventure, - there comes a time when you -- - damn.
I forgot to go to a cash machine.
can you lend me $20 for a cab?
pants pocket.
like I was saying, everything has its time and place, - but ultimately, you discover -- - you saw "the nanny diaries"?
Wendy was dying to see it.
but you said -- hmm.
you said you don't spend time together anymore.
we don't. The couples' therapist thought it would be a good idea.
but back to what I was trying to establish
don't I feel like a fool!
you had me convinced that you and your wife were practically strangers!
we are!
well, I don't go to the movies with strangers, Karl. Do you?
I mean, what kind of man would be so deceitful as to lie to the woman he's cheating on his wife with?
I bet Wendy would like to know what her loving husband is up to when he's not at home.
what are you saying?
you're gonna tell her about us?
not everything.
just the part about the sex and the hotel rooms.
Marla, wait.
cupcake!
sweetheart!
Marla, hey!
Marla, wait!
Marla! Let's discuss this in couples therapy!
come on, Karl. The mistress never tells.
just buy her something nice, like some jewelry or a low-carb bar.
I was seconds from ending it, and now...
I mean, Wendy and I may have grown apart lately, but the thought of losing her...
you know what's so funny? You're so worried about losing her.
what makes you think you haven't lost her already?
what's he talking about?
how do you know she's not spending her afternoons in a hotel room, too, lying in bed with your contractor, having the same conversations about you?
Wendy hates our contractor. He was completely unreliable.
what's wrong, James?
Stacey was having an affair with my boss.
I don't know what to say. - Well, I do.
that sucks.
I'd offer to take him out myself if Hector hadn't already done it for us.
okay. All this genuine emotion is making me a little uneasy.
that's it.
look at us.
I mean, we're supposed to be these alpha males, right?
but now James' wife is sleeping around on him, Karl can't control his crazy mistress, and I'm so whipped, I can't tell my wife that the delivery company can't seem to find her shipment of Napoleons.
men...
we're the new women.
what fresh hell?
give me good news.
what do you mean they're in Tampa?
well, how does that help me?
guys, I have pastry issues. I'll see you guys later.
what do you mean the cream filling won't clear customs?
it's a dessert, not an explosive.
I always said Brody had a real Napoleon complex.
Yeah, I should go, too.
see if Wendy's had the accounts frozen.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Me, too.
thank you.
keep the change.
Hi. Can I help you?
actually...
maybe I can help you.
you say you first met him a month ago?
I can't believe you.
to keep this from me -- all I can say is I'm shocked.
right. About that
why didn't you tell me you hired a decorator?
Marla and I were just discussing ideas for the guesthouse.
Oh. Good. The guesthouse.
it's so unlike Karl to take an interest in decorating.
Oh, isn't it amazing to be married to a man for all these years and not have the faintest idea who he is?
Duncan, what are you doing here?
my date is gonna be here any minute.
I need to talk to you about Cameron. She's headstrong, belligerent.
you can't tell her anything she doesn't already know.
you should be happy -- proof that she's yours.
vodka tonic. - To go.
I just don't think it's gonna work out with Cam.
well, she'll be disappointed, but it won't be the first time.
what's that supposed to mean?
she's angry at you, Duncan
not that she can admit it, but she is.
angry? I've given her everything she ever asked for.
but did you ever notice that after she turned 12, she stopped asking?
look, you may not have been the greatest father to date, but you're a good man.
and the best thing about being a father
every day is a chance to do better.
prettier.
you never stopped long enough to notice.
your date -- if it gets serious, no more wine cellars for us.
that's right, Duncan.
so I don't have to obsess.
you know, if we ever did get back together, you'd lose interest in me completely.
try me. - Maybe.
just not tonight.
what the hell's going on?
I didn't tell her about us, if that's what you mean.
then what are you doing here?
well, I came here to tell her, but then I realized Wendy's not the one I want to hurt.
and then we got to talking, and you know what?
we kind of hit it off.
you -- you hit it off with my wife?
she's smart and sweet and so funny.
funny? Wendy's funny?
Karl, how you can not appreciate her is beyond me.
she's a gem. I have half a mind to fix her up with my trainer.
here you go, hon. Sorry if it's a little strong.
perfect. I just need a couple more.
I never liked her, you know.
even when I said I did, I didn't.
but, of course, if you decide to take her back, I'll deny ever saying that.
who told you?
not you.
I had to find out the old-fashioned way.
Ah, office gossip.
well, what are they saying?
the men hate her, and the women are trying to figure out when you'll be ready to date.
you know, the heart is a complex little muscle.
but you're a great guy, and there are a lot of women out there that can see that, even if your wife can't.
you sure you're?
they called.
before you came in.
who called?
the board.
I've just been named C.E.O. of Amerimart.
you're kidding. - No.
they said they wanted new blood, new direction.
you're not kidding.
congratulations, James.
Thanks.
guess I'd better go. I'm late for a conference call.
don't want to get off on the wrong foot with the new boss.
these women that think I'm such a good guy
do I know any of them?
just the one that's gonna take your job if you screw it up.
Bye, boss.
can I help you?
I'm looking for Duncan Collinsworth. Do you know him?
as a matter of fact, I do.
unbelievable.
my wife finally makes a friend, and it's my mistress.
what are the odds?
well, at least you have something to talk about in couples' therapy.
Oh...
Hi! - Boy.
Duncan, there's someone I think you'd like to speak with.
Hi, sweetie.
just smile.
Hey, Janelle's thrilled.
she's having a great time.
this makes you happy, doesn't it?
Yeah, I know I bitch.
but, you know, she's got this other side, and I know you don't see it.
I don't see it as much as I should. But...
we just fit, you know?
Yeah, I know.
I see the Napoleons made it?
Nope, theye in Tampa.
found a little place in New Jersey -- boom. Knocked them out in two hours.
Janelle never knew the difference. - Nice.
so, remember...
if that reporter asks any questions, you never met me.
for a grand, I can forget almost anything.
perfect.
am I gonna be invited back? - Oh, absolutely.
guys.
this is Dontrelle.
Dontrelle, the guys. - They're cute.
they know you're packing. - Worth a shot.
come on.
Bye.
Wow.
I'm not asking you not to be angry at me, okay?
then what are you asking me?
if you're ever gonna be able to stop.
when I was promoted yesterday, you know what I thought?
I thought how I wished I could call you just to hear your voice.
and at the company dinner, how you should have been right beside me, wearing your little black dress.
that was the day I'd been dreaming of since business school, and all I could think of was what I'd lost.
it doesn't have to be that way, James. Why don't you just come home?
no. I can't.
C.E.O. of Amerimart.
world's most eligible bachelor, huh?
that's not what I wanted for myself.
not since econ01.
Bye. Bye-bye, sweetie.
good night. - Bye.
you and Dontrelle are not just old squash partners, right?
don't tell your mom, okay?
you know, Duncan, we're more alike than I thought.
we both have trouble getting out of our own ways.
are you gonna stop embarrassing me at work?
probably not.
are you gonna stop judging me? - Not likely.
at least we know where we stand.
good night, Duncan.
I'll see you Monday. - Hey...
you can call me "dad," you know.
I know.
good night, Duncan.
baby steps.
all right, ladies, my turn.
a toast to my new best friend Marla.
one. Just one for me.
the one over there with the cute little forked
what are you guys talking about?
the number of women in our lives that drive us absolutely crazy.
two for me.
God help me.
I'm with Brody.
one.
Yeah.
ask him again in six months.
what about you, Dunc?
2 1/2. - 2 1/2?
there's Lisbeth, obviously.
cameron, of course.
and I think Dontrelle's worth a half, don't you?
to Dontrelle.
he seemed like such a nice guy.
I don't know why you needed me to tape him.
because a thousand words paint a very nice picture.
great party.
16-piece band.
Janelle said it was the best birthday she has ever had.
gentlemen, I may actually have a shot with my own wife tonight.
just in case, I still have Dontrelle's number.
e-mail me.
I may have been your mistress, but now, I'm her best friend.
marla's going to be staying with us for a while.
were you having an affair with my boss?
I miss you.
we want you to come home.
I want a divorce.
sleepover's a big step for you two.
we're monogamous, Cam.
that what you want to hear?
Hello, cameron.
mom, w-what are you doing?
the arresting officer found a little black book with the names of all of her johns.
if this gets out, my career is over.
Terrence bailed Dontrelle out of jail.
Even-money says by now he's got the book.
watch it! - Whoa!
whoa, whoa! - Wow.
Dontrelle's little black book has you wound up, huh?
no, no. I'm fine.
you know, my company makes 20 different types of antianxiety drugs.
why don't I send you some brochures?
am I invisible? Where is my love?
my name is in that book, too.
but he got the threatening note.
and you own your own company ...
you won't lose your job if the book comes out.
it's not just the job.
it's Lisbeth.
I finally got her to stop seeing Terrence.
now, if this gets out...
I can't humiliate her like that.
speak of the deviL.
gentlemen.
Oh. Frau·Bluecher.
Ah...
well, you boys are up bright and early this morning.
you honing your games for the club championships this weekend?
you're in luck, Terrence.
I'm skipping the event this year.
hmm. That's too bad.
I would have welcomed the competition.
then you're really in luck, because I'm missing the tournanament to spend the weekend with Lisbeth.
well...
please send her my best.
yours will hardly be sufficient.
Hey, Duncan, be careful.
if Terrence gets ahold of that book, you may end up his caddy by this weekend.
although this new inventory protocol will be expensive short-term,
I assure you we'll see significant market gains by the end of next quarter.
but we'll need projections for its impact on Amerimart's global costs.
you'll have them first thing tomorrow.
if you please, turn to page 15, I'd like to discuss boosting our Q. C.Baseline.
-Mr. Walker?
line 2.
Oh, Sharon, no phone calls. I told you ...
it concerns "project goalpost."
Oh.
excuse me for one moment.
hello. -Hey, dad.
what's the place we went after soccer last week?
you know, with all those games and where the waiters sing to you?
captain longbeard's showtime funtorium.
what?
captain longbeard's showtime funtorium.
Oh, yeah, that's it.
some of the guys are going there after practice.
can we meet 'em there, please?
Oh, Dash, I'm sorry, buddy.
I can't. Some other time.
your dad's got a lot of work tonight.
Yeah. Okay. Bye.
okay, bye.
by all means, James...
don't let the billion-dollar decisions interfere with your personal life.
I don't know. Doctor - Doctor! He did this to me.
it's as though I don't exist in my own home - even see the chance - I'm worried I'll see an urn on the mantel,
wonder what's in it, - 12 years ... making his bed, making his meals.
and learn that I've been dead for three years. - Read the inscription, for what? A grunt?
did he ever once wonder how my day was? - It's howI know I'm alive.
stop, please.
okay.
how long has it been since the two of you have had sex?
let me check my almanac.
frost was on the vines, as I recall.
Why?
normally, we try to work through other relationship issues before focusing on the bedroom.
but in your case,I think it would be wise to put the cart before the horse, so to speak.
so you're saying you want us to have sex?
all right , kids.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
get your hands off my kids.
who the hell are you?
whoa. Whoa, James, relax.
how do you know my name?
dad...
that's just nick.
he's mommy's boyfriend.
come on, guys. Let's go.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.
I'm Nick·Dawkins.
Yeah, some other time, buddy.
what are you doing?
it's my night to pick up the kids.
you told Dash you had to work late.
no, I told Dash that I couldn't take him to Captain Longbeard's.
I never said I couldn't pick him and Sam up.
well, now that we'rell here, do you want to tell them that they can't go for pizza and video games, or should I just take them?
what do you guys want to do?
pizza. -Pizza.
pizza, okay. You take them.
here you go. Take this to the car. I'll be right there.
okay. -Sweetie.
come on, kids
who's your friend?
just make sure you show up to Dash's party on Saturday.
it's not bad enough the board's breathing down my neck.
now some strange guy's picking up my kids at soccer practice.
and what do I know about him? Nothing.
I mean, he could be a doomsday cultist.
he could be a red sox fan.
he could be ... -their new stepdad.
Hey, don't joke.
I didn't think I was.
that's how it went with me.
before long, some other guy was "dad," and Cam was calling me "Duncan."
thanks for the pick-me-up.
Brody, are you about to cry?
no, but...
I mean, what if?
guy loves his kids, gives them everything, and then ... no fault of your own ...
man, I've been ... I have been weirdly emotional lately.
I don't know what's going on.
okay, men stuff ... football, cars, Clint·Eastwood, sex.
discuss.
how's this?
uh, my shrink ordered me to have sex with my wife.
so what's the problem?
well, in the best of times, our sex life wasn't fantastic.
that was before Marla.
now that I've been on the matterhorn, Mr. Toad's wild ride may not be wild enough.
I'm the only person in America having g-rated sex.
and the last time I had that was six months ago.
"six months"? Wow.
Karl, it's like riding a bike.
you know, you just got to close your eyes and think of the tour de france.
it is official.
we are the world's worst support group.
can I crash here tonight?
I think you just did.
is there a problem?
other than having every crappy grunt job in the company land on my desk?
no, it's all good.
hold on. We gave you a desk?
you know, when I started at ... - yeah, yeah, I know.
you worked 30 hours a day, 15 days a week, and still found time to cheat on mom.
nice.
you're letting me hire someone?
go to human resources first thing tomorrow.
tell them to set up some interviews.
you know, back at Reveal, they're gonna say, "Duncan's tiny heart grew three sizes that day."
no good deed goes unpunished.
so, uh...
you're going away with mom, huh?
the entire weekend.
you know that's three days, right?
nine straight meals.
are you sure you can handle that level of commitment?
there's the Cam I know and love.
she's scared of you.
you know that?
scared of me? Why?
dating you, falling for you again.
afraid you'll break her heart.
and if you do break her heart, you should be very afraid...of me.
did we have a brownout?
welcome home, darling.
Oh, there you are.
did ... did we blow a fuse?
not yet.
so...
do you like our new chair?
mm, I can't tell. Which one is it?
Ooh. Oh.
it's a louis quatorze chair.
know why it's called that?
because it doesn't have any arms.
Louis quatorze put armless chairs in every room at versailles.
you know why?
no clue.
because he thought chairs...
should be for more than just sitting.
Oh. Um, I'm guessing we're staying in tonight.
want the good news or the bad news?
uh, start with the good.
well, the board approved our proposals.
Hey, that's great.
and the bad?
now we have to implement them.
you got your sleeping bag?
if that's as bad as you got, we're in pretty good shape.
and there was also some grumbling about "project goalpost.
Oh, well, that's tough. I'm gonna be there for my kids.The board's gonna have to deal with that.
wow, you sound like every working mom in America with a touch more self-righteousness and, uh, better pants.
Hey, can I ask you something?
hmm?
um...
hypothetically speaking, do you think I-I cross some sort of a line if I hire a private detective to do some just minimal background check on my ex-wife's boyfriend?
just ... just to reassure myself.
I think you crossed the line by saying that sentence out loud, hypothetically speaking.
Yeah, I guess I could talk to the kids and suss out the situation.
whoa, whoa.
single dad 101 ... never grill your kids about mommy's new boyfriend.
this requires a much lighter touch.
and you need deniability.
so, what do I do?
let auntie Katie talk to 'em.
holy cow.
that was so...
not us!
Yeah.
I know.
well, to be honest, Marla had a lot to do with it.
you ... come again?
I mean, Marla suggested the change in location.
and the chair.
and that thing right at the end, with the fluttering?
it's called the argentinean honeybee.
see?
it's not so bad having her around, is it?
Wow.
who would have thought you and I could have such mind-blowing sex?
that's one way to describe it.
checked out those pictures online.
the cabin is beautiful.
the lake isn't a hundred feet from our front door.
well, you're assuming we're ever gonna leave the bedroom.
time to pay up.$100, 000. 10pm. Tonight. Wait for location.
what's wrong?
urgent message from the office.
the japanese are making a run at Reveal.
buying up all our stock.
we're not going, are we?
I'm so incredibly sorry, Lisbeth.
I got to go back to the office and deal with this now.
okay.
next weekend, okay?
okay.
Thanks.
the "argentinean honeybee"?
it was mind-blowing sex, and it was with my wife.
I didn't even think that was possible.
what's wrong this time?
I'm gonna miss our tee time next week because I promised to take Janelle up to Connecticut to have brunch with her parents.
why am I reacting like this?
what is happening to me?!
not to get too personal, but is janelle on her "cycle" at the moment?
her "cycle"?
hold on. Let me check.
Yeah, why?
I'm sorry. You keep track of janelle's cycle in that thing?
Yeah.
comes in pretty handy.
I know which days of the month not to talk about, you know, politics, money, or...
sex.
Brody, have you ever heard of something called "masculine parasympathetic affect disorder"?
it's a range of maladies mirroring the P. M.S.
symptoms of the dominant female in a man's life ...
irritability, radical mood swings, bloat.
Oh, come on. That can't be a real thing. - No, no, no.
no, no, no, that's what it feels like.
I'm so ugly.
no, actually, this disorder is increasingly common.
my firm just came out with a new pill called "mascurox."
it treats all the symptoms of "he-M. S." which is what we call it around the office.
I'll send you some samples.
no, no, I'll come get them.
I could use the exercise after eating all this fried food.
Duncan, why aren't you in the mountains?
because I'm in the crapper.
I got another e-mail.
they want 100 grand for the book?
small price toay.
and when's the hand-off?
tonight.
I'll get another e-mail with the exact location.
Duncan, as a crisis-management professional,
I got to say I think paying ransom demands is a big mistake.
Brody, as a man fighting to win back the only woman he's ever loved, I'm paying it.
Hey, but listen, man.
that book could be photocopied.
and nothing prevents them from hitting you up for more money or, for that matter, hitting up anybody else in that book ... namely, me.
I'm saying it's time to get the police involved.
I'm saying it's not.
I can afford the money.
what I can't afford is the notoriety.
so, how'd lisbeth take you canceling your weekend together?
better than she'd take reading in the post about me having a bathroom tryst with a preop tranny.
well -whoever's behind this sure knows how to screw up your personal life.
maybe terrence got his hands on it.
no, he doesn't care about the money.
if he had that book, he'd be up to something much worse.
trust me.
whoa, lisbeth.
Oh, what a surprise.
Hi. -Hi.
thought you were away this weekend.
I was...
until duncan's business intervened.
life as a C. E.O.Right?
even when you leave the office, sometimes the office won't leave you.
I don't know.
I always manage to carve out time for the truly important things in life.
walk with me?
Terrence, um...
you should know I'm giving it another shot with duncan.
I was under the impression you'd already done that.
a number of times.
besides, it's just walking.
Oh, come on, terrence.
a walk is never just a walk.
have a nice day.
dash, when you're done reading last year's financials, why don't you go check out the fish tank?
I got a really cool new angelfish.
dad, I already saw it.
can we go?
I'm bored. - I'm not.
I'm coloring.
Oh. Oh, honey, could you not?
those are my earnings proje... were my earnings pojections.
guess who got the last two ice-cream bars from the commissary?
let's go eat 'em in my office, okay?
I'll find out everything you need to know.
I'll just be decrayoning my office.
what are you doing?
watching you.
Why?
because I like the way you move, Mrs. Mixworthy.
come here.
what do you say we forget about the dishes until tomorrow and maybe head up to bed?
or into a chair, perhaps?
actually, I'm kind of tired, karl.
I just want to read for a bit and collapse.
now?
the new elle decor came.
good night, sweetheart.
so?
first and foremost, nick does not sleep over.
excellent. Any idea what he does for a living?
sounds like he had some sort of internet company and sold it at just the right time.
for all intents and purposes, he's retired.
the kids see a lot of him, huh?
Yeah, but, you know, they like him.
in fact, they went out of their way to say how fun he is, and they implied that mommy's been in a much better mood lately.
James, if your main concern was that stacey was letting some creep hang around your kids, this is good news.
they called him "fun"?
what did you do to that poor girl?
me?!
she came in here looking for the "devil wears prada" job.
you know, where you get to wear great clothes and rub elbows with fashion royalty.
all I did was explain what we do in here every minute ...
make copies for assistants of assistants, oh, taking time out to get lattes.
it's the third interview today that ended like that.
Hey, what happened to your big weekend?
we were on our way, and duncan got a call about this hostile-takeover thing.
I figured he'd be working late, so I brought some chinese.
want to join us for a "happy broken family" dinner?
mom, duncan hasn't been in all day.
I've been by his office a couple times on mail runs.
and honestly, if there was any buzz about a hostile takeover,I would have heard about it.
well, I can only imagine where he is right now.
come on,
I know it's a lot of money, but it's worth it.
I'm talking about the bag ... you're doing a ransom drop using a recherch?
Janelle couldn't even find one in thstates.
it just seems like you're giving this jackwad a tip for blackmailing you!
I'll get a trash bag.
the bag is fine.
will you stop talking about the bag?
I'll get you one when we get back.
now, just relax.
what? I'm relaxed.
yeah? I don't know.
you seem a bit... worked up.
sorry. It's my first ransom drop, you know?
and it really gets the blood going.
Jersey Park, Drop money in NE trash can.
we have an address.
let's go, now.
we can stop on the way and get the guy a nice bottle of wine, too.
Where's wendy?
she was tired. She went to bed.
at 8: 30?
hmm.
guess I don't have to worry about coming in unannounced and catching you two in the act.
for your information, we've turned a corner.
things are great in that department, thank you very much.
hmm.
for you, maybe.
what does that mean?
you're a smarty-pants.
figure it out.
so now what, crisis management?
Oh, n't act like I'm in charge.
you put the blackmailer in charge the second you agreed to his demands.
I'm not even here in an official capacity.
I'm just here for morasupport.
we should have guns.
look, look, look, look.
he's early.
and he loves the bag.
Ohh.
he didn't leave the book.
what?
the bastard did not leave the bo.
Hey.
Hey!
Hey, you!
Hey! You stop right now! Right there!
Hey!
Aah!
get off of me!
come here!
Where's the book?!
"Book"?! What book?!
Dontrelle's book!
what's the title?
Oh, you think you're funny, huh?!
that's my money, man.
I found it.
help! I'm being robbed!
help!
Brody, I don't think he's the guy.
Yeah, we'll find out pretty soon.
I need two 4-inch nails and some jumper cables.
no, brody, look.
that's him.
Hey!
we got your money right here!
Hey! No, no, no, no!
wait! Wait! Wait!
well, that went pretty well, huh?
Oh, good find on that one, dash.
I must have walked right by it. You got eagle eyes, buddy.
Yeah.
this one ... what's that one? - Garnet.
Hey, guys.
Hey, mom. - Mom.
sorry. We were doing dash's homework.
I guess I lost track of time.
uh, yeah, I guess so.
um, why don't you guys go get your book bags?
you were supposed to have them back at my house over an hour ago.
did you know dash had a science project due on Monday?
it's okay. We managed to collect the, uh, four required metamorphic rock samples.
kind of hard to do in the amerimart parking lot.
you've got to stay on top of him with these things.
he ... he conveniently forgets to mention his homework.
you know what? You can put me down as a wife as much as you want.
but don't imply that I'm a bad mom.
all right, listen, I was invited by clients to share their box next sunday at the jets game.
I know it's not my turn, but i was hoping to take the kids.
a week from sunday? We had plans to go to the beach.
"we"? Who's "we"?
me and the kids.
Nick has a beach house.
Oh.
Wow. Really?
a family outing.
is it too soon to get him a stocking to hang from the mantel at christmas?
come on, james. - No, no. You know what? You're ... you're right.
I-I will take the kids to the dentist, and I will force them to do their homework, and I will work my ass off providing for them just to makeure nick is freed up to show them a good time.
dad?
are you guys fighting?
no, no, sweetie. Daddy was just saying good night.
Hey, buddy...
you haven't told me what you wanted for your birthday.
Oh, yeah, captain clobber action figure with the ice prison playset.
"captain clobber," huh?
it's a superhero tv show.
Oh, of course.
all right, you guys go home. Get some sleep. I'll see you tomorrow.
give me a hug.
Bye, dad. Love you. - Bye, dad. Love you.
love you
but did you see it? The fear in his eyes?
Oh, just, ooh!
you know what it felt like?
it felt like, uh ... it felt like russell crowe.
Russell crowe? - Yeah, russell crowe.
but not that winery movie russell crowe, you know "gladiator" russell crowe, you know, where you're staring into the eyes of a vanquished foe, knowing that you hold his fate in your hands.
should he live?
should he die?
should he have a telephone thrown at him?
Yeah, and he knew it, too.
he knew that he was the prey, and I was the hunter.
hunh!
are you on something? - What?
of course not.
except for those pills that karl gave me, you know, for my condition.
the he-M. S.'Ing. - Right.
let me see 'em.
these things are full of testosterone to counteract the symptoms.
that's why you've been acting so goofy and macho.
what? - So, you fend off the Japanese?
Oh, hey, lbeth.
I was just gonna ... - good night, brody.
what's going on, duncan?
and before you say anything, I'm asking you ...begging you not to lie to me.
there's no other woman.
I wish I could tell you more than that.
that's not good enough.
not anymore.
you said to me that things were gonna be different this time.
and they're not, are they?
you're already lying to me.
please, let me solve this problem on my own, and I promise I'll never lie to you again.
God, I am so dumb.
Lisbeth, don't go.
I can make this right.
listen to yourself, duncan.
you're already breaking your promises.
Oh, uh, wendy, can we talk?
Oh, can it wait, hon?
I'm already late for my appointment at the showroom.
no, I-I need to ask you something.
Karl, you're making me nervous.
do I make you happy, wendy?
what a silly question. Of course you do.
in bed?
you're so thoughul in the bedroom.
thoughtful.
considerate.
polite.
I hear other women complain that their men never spend any time on but that's not you.
on the effort front, you get an a-plus.
"a" for effort.
but for performance?
can we grade on a curve?
silver comet?
I-I don't know. You tell me.
you're the costume store.
Yeah, okay. Fine.
Yep, I'll do that. Thank you.
that's the drag about working saturdays ... no assistants handling this stuff.
you know, I bet you didn't know that captain clobber is so that there's not a costume store within a 30-mile radius that can keep him in stock.
I'm guessing this is your stab at capturing the "world's funnest dad" trophy?
and I guess the, uh, silver comet will just have to do.
they tell me he's another character in the series.
well, on the bright side, I'd totally do someone called silver comet.
captain clobber? He sounds like a drag.
if only you re my target demo.
well, um, I'll ... I'll see you at the party.
Oh, and, james...
remember ... fun!
I'm here about the job.
do you see what I'm doing right now, on my sarday?
Yeah.
it's the highlight of my day.
luxury.
I once spent an entire morning decaramelizing a caramelized apple for my boss.
when can you start?
can I ask you a question?
when we were together, did I ever satisfy you?
take your time. Really think.
no.
why didn't you ever say anything?
because you weren't another tom or jerry.
excuse me? - Tom and jerry.
my previous boyfriends. Bastards, both of them.
great in the sack, though.
still, after those two, you were welcome relief, a nice man.
you never yelled at me.
I got to be the boss.
and you always had such nice manners.
I just assumed I couldn't have it all.
I cat believe I'm asking this, but...
please, tell me, what made messieurs tom and jerry so "great in the sack," as you say?
are you asking me for sex lessons?
no, not sex lessons.
just tips.
some how-tos, perhaps.
okay.
but only because I love wendy.
she's a saint, and she deserves some happinS.
great.
now stand up, turn around, and close your eyes.
now!
it's not what it looks like.
we're both fully clothed.
Oh, great. You're coping well.
this? I just use this to sterilize the orange juice.
you know, we're gonna get crushed.
that little black book is out there, and...
I don't want to talk about it. - Don't panic.
what happened to the gladiator within?
I think the drugs wore off.
maybe your first instinct was correct.
panic. - What?!
you blew it, pal.
how much is this black book worth?
we'll let the market decide.
this is great.
we're dead. We're dead.
Hey, you guys. Have you seen james? He's late.
he was, uh, planning on making a big entrance.
huge.
make way for the silver comet!
awesome! Dad came as the bad guy!
the silver comet? Nick?
sworn enemy of captain clobber?
stand back from these children, or I will be forced to use drastic measures.
Oh, no.
stand down, comet. I'm warning you.
so, we meet again, captain clobber.
you hand over that child! He escaped from my fortress of doom!
make me! - Yeah!
fight!
you'll never get that boy back!
Oh, yeah?
clobber, get him.
Oh, my...
I've got to admit, he's a lot more fun than I thought.
I don't know what you were thinking.
you actually started a fight in front of our children.
I have no idea how I'm going to explain this to the other mothers.
he shouldn't have been here, stacey.
I don't get it. Am I not supposed to date?
should I be wearing black for the next year?
maybe pin on a scarlet letter?
no, it's just that it'd be nice to think that the end of our marriage required some period of...let's say "adjustment."
I still can't bear to take your picture off the desk, but you ... you hit the ground running.
and you haven't dated? - No. No. Not like you.
not having some new person around the kids.
I mean, you were the unfaithful one.
I feel like m the one being punished.
I see my kids less, and when i do,
I'm competing with some guy that doesn't have to work every day to provide for two households.
then it's over.
he's gone.
U'd really end it with this guy?
I don't want to move on, james, remember?
I want to go back.
we've been down that road, stacey.
it's a nice road.
the kids say you've been a lot happier lately.
you should keep seeing him.
Wendy, sweetie, it's not what it looked like.
I find marla repulsive.
Oh, please. - I did it for you.
then next week when I'm pleasuring anton, the masseuse at my day spa,
I hope you can find comfort in the fact that I'm doing it for you!
I just recently learned that I'm a failure in the bedroom!
forgive me if I went to extreme measures to improve my game.
did you attack her? Is that it?
you wanted to prove that you're a man?!
no, I did not attack her.
and, yes, I would like to prove I'm a man!
I went to marla for advice, bedroom advice!
that's all it was! It worked for you. I thought it might work for me.
I wanted to learn how to please you. - You want to please me?
when my lawyer calls, don't forget the cayman island accounts!
come here.
delivery for Ms. Collinsworth.
it's just a wok
well, a wok is just a wok.
Oh, wow, karl.
I mean, wow.
Oh, whatever marla taught you...
she taught me to figure out what I want and go get it.
and what is it you want?
one guess.
Thanks, cameron.
you know, we don't always work saturdays and sundays.
just most of them.
that's cool. I can use the hours.
well, I'm gonna deliver these. You want to keep collating?
I live to collate.
uh, you know, after we're done, we could grab something to eat or something.
sounds great.
all right, then.
Hey, it's me.
I got the job.
no, of course I haven't told them.
sounds like you and duncan have quite a history.
it's my curse, I suppose ...
an attraction to alpha males.
you're not gonna spend the evening coming up with a list of all the ways I'm like your ex-husband, are you?
I don't need to.
my shrink already did for me.
you don't like him, do you?
I ... I admire a lot about him.
his moxie.
he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps.
I mean, very few members at firmwood can claim that.
he's got a magnetism that serves him well in his chosen field, and, more importantly, he crushes his driver.
and he's charming when he wants to be.
sounds like another man I know.
there's a big difference, lisbeth.
I reserve all my charm for one woman.
I've been called a lot of things, but never a playboy.
how many times are you gonna keep touching a hot stove?
I mean, sooner or later, we all figure out that it hurts every time.
let me remind you what it feels like to be in a good relationship.
I mean, how can you not tell?
meg ryan in the diner ...totally fake.
when it's real, the woman's eyes roll back in her head.
every muscle goes taut.
even the toes.
especially the toes.
when a man knows what he's looking for, it's obvious.
wait up! Wait up! Wait up!
Hey, I am about to show you ladies what 300 yards looks like.
what happened to brunch with the in-laws?
you know, I woke up this morning and thought I would rather be out here golfing with you guys and told janelle exactly that.
honey, I'm going to the course.
give your parents my best.
you tooknother one of karl's testosterone pills, didn't you?
Yes, I absolutely did.
I actually kept a couple, put them in my safe at home.
for emergencies, like my anniversary.
black Book Sold to Higher Bidder! Thanks for Playing
the other shoe just dropped.
the blackmailer just sold dontrelle's appointment book on the open market.
I'm a dead man walking.
it might not be that bad. You're a fashion icon, not a politician.
maybe reveal won't want to lose you.
maybe, but I'll most certainly lose lisbeth when she hears about this.
maby you should be the one to tell her.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
first rule of P. R... Control the story.
sweetie, how do you feel about being the girlfriend of a man "who's about to be in every tabloid for getting a truck-stop knobber from 'dude looks like a lady'?
needs work.
look, you guys all know lisbeth.
how do you think this particular truth is gonna hit her?
well, we already know how well lying's worked out for you.
good point.
I'm gonna go find her.
the truth.
so crazy, it just may work.
Hey, jackass, that's my cart!
sorry.
pills are still in my system.
okay, I know that, in our past,
I've taken certain liberties with the truth that ended up hurting you.
no, let me take that back.
I lied, and I'm sorry for that.
but it was my intention that, this time, there would be no reason to lie, because I wasn't gonna do anything wrong.
and in a way, I didn't.
but sometimes...
sometimes the past just comes back with a vengeance.
Duncan, you need to stop. - No, I can't. I'm in a zone.
I need to get this out.
so, this ... this thing I did wrong, it's humiliating.
mean, really, really humiliating.
and the last thing I want to do is embarrass you,'cause I want this ...us ...to work this time. I do.
Duncan, if you care for me, you'll leave through the kitchen door.
please, I don't want a scene.
I'll get that.
thought that was your car out front.
Terrence, could you wait for me outside, please?
I can't do it again, duncan.
I can't risk my heart with you.
I've let you break it too many times.
and it's not romantic anymore.
it's sad and pathetic.
so, please, just let me go.
where? - What?
Where's he taking you?
just on a drive.
a drive is never just a drive. You know that.
hold on.
I've got something of yours.
I received a curious e-mail yesterday.
the sender wrote that they had read on some gossip site that I might have reason to want to take down duncan collinsworth.
he offered to sell me a little black book for a quarter of a million.
I negotiated down to 100 grand.
of course you did.
Ah, he shouldn't have let me know he was a disgruntled evidence clerk.
first rule of negotiation.
that's more than a year's salary.
so is that how you wormed your way back into lisbeth's life?
showed her my dirtyaundry?
she doesn't know anything about it.
and now...
she never has to.
what's the catch? - There is no catch.
you really don't get it, do you?
I care for lisbeth.
I don't want her to be the butt of a thousand jokes.
all this is behind her now.
so this is yours.
and perhaps...
she's mine.
1585
spain is the most powerful empire in the world.
philip of Spain, a devout Catholic,
has plunged Europe into to Holy War.
only England stands against him,
ruled by a protestant queen.
come, my daughter,
Isabella.
God has spoken to me,
the time for our great enterprise has come.
england is enslaved to the devil.
we must set her free.
why do you go among the people, Majesty?
I tell you plainly, you will be murdered.
every Catholic in England is a potential assassin!
be warned by the atrocities in France.
we know the Catholics take their orders from Spain.
the Spanish speak openly of Mary Stuart as Queen of England in waiting.
their loyalty is to the Pope in Rome!
how many Catholics are there in England, sir?
immense numbers, Majesty.
half the nation cling to the old superstitions.
what would you have me do?
hang half the people of England or just imprison them?
we must act, Majesty.
our inaction is perceived as weakness.
if my people break the law, they shall be punished.
until that day, they shall be protected.
Majesty, we have proven reason to fear every Catholic in the...
fear creates fear.
I am not ignorant of the dangers, sir.
but I will not punish my people for their beliefs.
only for their deeds.
I am assured that the people of England love their Queen.
my constant endeavor is to earn that love.
fotheringhay Castle-Mary Queen of Scots' prison.
my Queen.
our friends write to give us hope.
soon, England's true believers will rise up against the bastard usurper Elizabeth and slit her throat.
that's enough!
slit her throat? Please.
and when that bastard usurper is dead my lady will be queen.
your bishops are preaching that God is showing his displeasure because the Queen is still unmarried, some rudely suggesting infertile.
what nonsense.
dangerous nonsense.
Mary Stuart has a son.
why does everyone torment me with Mary Stuart?
it's not her fault. She's next in line to the throne.
don't hide your face.
so long as you have no issue.
if you were to produce an heir, there'd be no more talk of Mary, Queen of Scots.
I've heard it's customary to obtain a husband before producing an heir.
we shall have to hunt out a husband for you soon, Bess.
not too soon, my lady.
there are husbands to be had.
you don't want to be married?
I'll want to be married if I want the man...
Austria. France.
turkey. Turkey has a sultan. China has an emperor.
I confine myself to the possible.
that's where you and I differ, Walsingham.
I find the impossible far more interesting.
what kind of man would you want?
an honest man with friendly eyes.
and good legs. And sweet breath.
so you can kiss him without choking.
there must be any amount of princes in the undiscovered lands across the sea.
find me an honest one of those.
since when do we discuss private matters in public spaces?
I ask Your Majesty's forgiveness.
have my doctors confirm that the Queen is still fertile.
the people need to be reassured.
I care for your safety.
the threats to your person are real.
you know very well, if I fall, you'll all come tumbling down after me.
the sea wall at Dover is cracking.
Francis.
we have no money to rebuild our defenses.
turn your mind to that threat.
may we have wisdom not to fear shadows in the night.
and courage when the day of danger truly dawns.
I sacrifice Spain's forest,
to build the greatest fleet that ever sailed.
Elizabeth,
why are you leading your people to hell?
whore.
my time has come, Majesty.
send me back to England to begin God's work.
your Majesty.
guards! Take hold of him!
a puddle in the way,
Majesty.
a puddle.
puddle.
you'll have to see the Lord Chamberlain, sir.
which one is he?
he's over there.
you can't come in.
so how am I to see him if you won't let me through?
you must wait for him to come out.
and when will he come out?
there's no way of knowing that.
I had less trouble than this boarding a Spanish ship.
what if enemy ships should sail up the Thames, can the docks be closed?
not closed, Majesty. But the gun positions...
Spanish...
ambassador.
king Eric of Sweden, Majesty.
not again.
still madly in love with you.
still mad, you mean.
Ivan, Tsar of all the Russias.
Where's Bess?
known as "Ivan the Terrible," Majesty.
late.
I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.
given.
once.
the Archduke Charles of Austria, Majesty.
the puddle man is outside, Majesty.
my suitors.
younger brother to Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor.
cousin of Philip of Spain. Wealthy.
he's rather handsome.
how old is he?
young, I believe, Majesty.
an Austrian alliance would keep France quiet.
and put Philip on a leash.
I've become almost enthusiastic.
send for him.
how much longer do you think I can play this game, Francis?
virginity is an asset that holds its value well.
Walter Raleigh, Majesty.
lousy pirate
your Majesty, this man is a notorious pirate.
spanish gold stolen from Spanish ships, attacked without provocation.
well, sir, what do you want?
I have just returned from the New World, Majesty.
I have claimed the fertile coast in your name and called it Virginia in honor of our Virgin Queen.
Virginia?
and when I marry will you change the name to Conjugia?
I ask your gracious permission, Majesty, to return to the New World with your royal warrant to found a colony under the laws and protections of England.
he wants money.
who are they?
natives of the Americas, Majesty.
have they no ruler of their own?
none to match England's Queen.
these gentlemen are welcome.
see that they are treated well.
I also come bearing gifts for Your Majesty.
these gifts, Majesty, are the fruits of piracy, the true property of the realm of Spain.
let's see, shall we? What have you brought me?
Patata, Majesty.
you eat it. Very nourishing.
tobacco.
you breathe its smoke.
very stimulating.
gold.
courtesy of a Spanish ship that found itself unable to complete its journey.
forgive me, Majesty.
I find the air has become stale.
I am sensitive to the smell of open sewers.
I cannot accept the fruits of piracy, Mr. Raleigh.
philip of Spain is no friend of England, Majesty.
the more gold I take from him, the safer you will be.
well, well.
a political pirate.
and Your Majesty's most loyal subject.
welcome home, Mr. Raleigh
lord Howard, the docks.
master Raleigh.
you eat it...
you pirates have gone too far.
my king is very angry.
you traitor!
Judas!
you're Walsingham's pawn!
don't do this! I didn't say anything!
you're a Protestant traitor!
don't do it! Don't!
don't! Hold his head!
you Judas! You Judas! Stop!
you Judas!
the traitor's dead. We must act!
why do we not strike? What are we waiting for?
you wait for my order.
Walsingham knows too much already.
one traitor is dead.
who can I trust now?
there's a visitor waiting, sir.
William.
Hello, Francis.
you've always been a fellow who delighted in surprises.
you look well, Francis.
well, you look dreadful.
they're not feeding you in Paris.
you can't learn the secrets of the universe on an empty stomach.
then she my heart beguiled.
Mary. William. Supper is ready.
William.
have you spoken to the Queen?
I speak with the Queen daily.
you work too hard. You're a sick man.
William, come over here and sit by me.
William, if we are not allowed to sin, maybe we could talk theology.
you have done enough. No man could do more.
I can't leave the court yet, Ursula. She needs me.
never listens to me. Not a thought for his health.
so you talk to him, he's your brother.
William, what do they say in Paris about the Pope's call for holy war?
many welcome it.
why must we talk about war?
tell us your nice news, William.
are you married yet? Not yet.
Mary, would you leave William alone, please?
sweet, sit.
grace?
Oh, Lord, provider of all things, we offer Thee our humble thanks.
in the name of the Holy Trinity, amen.
Amen.
more lines on my face.
where do they come from?
smile lines, my lady.
smile lines?
when do I ever smile?
now you have smile lines, too.
the beauty of Your Majesty is dazzling to my eyes.
I am overwhelmed.
I am conquered.
I die.
only your love, my stattlich Elizabeth, can restore me into life.
your Highness does me great honor.
Oh, Elizabeth.
how blessed am I to stand in your fabled presence.
Ah, Elizabeth.
to speak your name is to hear celestial music.
may that sweet sound guide me through my life to come.
Elizabeth.
I have traveled here to this illustrious court in the hope that our two great nations might be joined in love.
he interests me.
talk to him.
him, my lady?
him.
I adore the natives you brought.
I don't suppose you could get one for me.
they're not dangerous, are they?
that depends on what you propose to do with them.
I'd dress him up in mulberry colored silk, and have him walk behind me, carrying my cloak.
I have a secret, my dear.
I pretend there's a pane of glass between me and them.
they can see me, but they cannot touch me.
you should try it.
Majesty, I am...
it is something, after all, to take a blank on the map and build there a shining city.
which you will no doubt name after yourself.
no doubt.
may I ask a question in return?
of course.
how am I to win the Queen's favor?
why should I tell you that?
I've little enough to offer, but whatever I have to give, ask, and it's yours.
say what you mean to say as plainly as possible.
all men flatter the Queen in hope of advancement.
pay her the compliment of truth.
I don't even know your name.
Elizabeth Throckmorton.
a second Elizabeth?
everyone calls me Bess.
your most serene Majesty bright star of our firmament, we present our humble masque of the heavenly spheres.
his Highness is tired after his long journey.
no man can become tired in the presence of so lovely a queen.
you play the game very well, my young friend, but don't you sometimes feel an overwhelming desire to say what you're really thinking?
I daren't even think what I'm really thinking.
you're thinking perhaps...
that you'd far rather be home.
you're very wise, your majesty.
his Highness, the Archduke informs me that my charms overwhelm him.
he will retire to his private chambers to rest.
I don't want him hurt by your schemes.
so how should we proceed?
perhaps we should all retire.
I suspect him of being a professional charmer.
am I right?
he is certainly charming, my lady.
well, there are duller professions.
you like him, don't you?
he's a man that lives in a world far beyond the court.
it's refreshing.
well.
we shall let him come again.
blue.
can you imagine what it is to cross an ocean?
for weeks, you see nothing but the horizon, perfect and empty.
you live in the grip of fear.
fear of storms.
fear of sickness on board.
fear of the immensity.
so you must drive that fear down deep into your belly.
study your charts.
watch your compass.
pray for a fair wind.
and hope, pure, naked, fragile hope.
Majesty, the Archduke and court are waiting.
let them wait.
go on, Mr. Raleigh.
you were hoping.
at first, it's no more than a haze on the horizon.
so you watch.
you watch.
then it's a smudge, a shadow on the far water.
for a day.
for another day.
the stain slowly spreads along the horizon taking form, until on the third day, you let yourself believe.
you dare to whisper the word.
land.
land.
life.
resurrection.
the true adventure.
coming out of the vast unknown, out of the immensity, into new life.
that, Your Majesty, is the New World.
I like your immensities.
your ocean is an image of eternity, I think.
such great spaces make us small.
do we discover the New World, Mr. Raleigh, or does the New World discover us?
you speak like a true explorer.
I like you, Mr. Raleigh.
and I like you.
you know, of course, that when I like a man,
I reward him.
I have heard that.
and what have you to say about it?
reward my mission, Majesty, not me.
is the mission not the man?
then you leave me free to like you in return.
go on.
I think it must be hard for so great a queen to know the simple pleasure of being liked for herself.
now you grow dull.
come on!
mine.
you have the stronger horse.
yours carries the lighter load.
no.
the Queen does not give way to others.
Whoa! Whoa!
forgive me, Majesty. My horse doesn't seem to know his place yet.
have you ever known your place, Mr. Raleigh?
Oh, come on!
it's from her.
Mary Stuart is the heart and soul of our enterprise.
make sure she, and only she reads this.
we wait for her order.
the order must be given clearly.
the jailer, madam.
my noble jailer.
am I a danger to England even when I pray?
as always, ma'am, my concern is for your safety.
I pray for my cousin Elizabeth.
do you think she prays for me?
is it true that I've never known the pleasure of being liked for myself?
I hope you believe I like you for yourself, my lady.
is anyone ever liked simply for themselves?
I doubt it.
are you?
men like you because you're pretty, and because you have the ear of the Queen.
no doubt.
him, too.
he likes you because he wants my favor.
you do realize that.
Yes, my lady.
and the other thing, too, of course.
but then, all men want that.
male desire confers no distinction.
Oh, I envy you, Bess.
you're free to have what I cannot have.
you're my adventurer.
thank you for coming.
you mustn't send letters to the palace.
you know what would happen if I was caught.
I need your help.
more money? No.
my father doesn't want to hide like this anymore.
of course.
we both want to get back into favor with the court.
that's impossible.
you know that you're Papists.
why impossible?
everyone at court has a Papist somewhere in their family.
Francis. Just as you have.
speak to the Queen. You are her favorite.
my father and I will embrace the new faith.
cousin Bess. No.
we have known each other all our lives.
I would do nothing to harm you.
why can't you help us? They will kill us!
Oh. Do not tease me, Mr. Raleigh.
there's nothing I'd like to do more.
so why don't you?
all right, then. I will.
you see? You lie.
you don't want me on your ship at all. You're a liar.
Bess. Would you like to go to sea?
I'm afraid that's not possible.
women bring bad luck on board ship.
do they?
lock up a hundred men in a space smaller than this room for months at a time.
men have needs.
a beautiful woman would drive us all mad.
men have needs?
let them stay on land and see to their needs.
Mr. Raleigh is eager to sail away to his maiden colony.
we must persuade him to stay a little longer. Mustn't we, ladies?
Bess?
No!
wait! What do you want? Who are you?
let me go, damn it! Who the hell are you?
if you won't assist me, perhaps your father will.
no.
enough.
enough.
yes?
you cannot save England now.
the Enterprise has begun.
ambassador?
what do you know of the Enterprise of England?
the Enterprise? Forgive me, Majesty, I'm not familiar...
two armies are landing on the coasts of Sussex and Norfolk.
Mary Stuart is to be set free and placed on the English throne, and I am to be assassinated.
does any of this sound familiar?
I know nothing of any invasion plans...
well, I refer to this plan as the Enterprise of England, it should more accurately be called la Empresa de Inglaterra because it is a Spanish plan.
the plan of my one-time brother-in-law, your king, to attack my country.
your country? It is my country that is under attack.
your so-called pirates, your pirates attack our merchant ships daily.
and you... You think we don't know where the orders come from?
the whole world knows these pirates sail up the Thames, all the way to your royal bed.
you will leave my presence, sir.
go back to your rat hole.
tell Philip I fear neither him, nor his priests, nor his armies.
tell him if he wants to shake his little fist at us, we're ready to give him such a bite, he'll wish he'd kept his hands in his pockets.
you see a leaf fall and you think you know which way the wind blows.
well, there is a wind coming, madam, that will sweep away your pride.
I, too, can command the wind, sir!
I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare if you dare to try me!
what are you staring at?
lower your eyes. I am the Queen!
you are not my equal, sir, and you never will be!
Majesty.
Elizabeth has come to know of our enterprise.
then we will attack as soon as possible.
God has abandoned Elizabeth.
england must be crushed.
certainly, majesty.
what news of the Jesuit?
his mission proceeds as planned, majesty.
the fleet must be ready to sail in a month.
that's impossible, majesty!
impossible is not God.
only a miracle.
exactly...
a miracle.
God's miracle.
Yes, majesty.
the alignments of the planets is most unusual this year.
mars is due to take the ascendant three days after the anniversary of Your Majesty's birth.
and also on that day, there is a full moon, which governs the fortune of all princes of the female gender.
princes of the female gender.
I mean to say, a prince who is also a woman.
Yes, Dr. Dee, I am following you.
what does it mean?
it means the rise of a great empire.
Majesty, and the fall of another.
convulsions.
which empire is to rise and which is to fall?
that I cannot say, Majesty.
astrology is, as yet, more an art than a science.
nothing more, Dr. Dee?
no more specific calamities we can guard against?
he means, will I be assassinated?
Walsingham, would you leave us for a moment?
and the private life of this prince of the female gender, what do the stars foretell there?
these are matters of state, Majesty.
surely the stars foretell matters of state, Dr. Dee.
for such a prediction I must look in a different chart.
wonderful.
such strength.
you will need all your strength in the days to come.
but you doubt yourself, my child.
I have not seen fear in your face for such a long time.
have I reason to fear?
something has weakened you.
there are hard days coming.
but I am no prophet.
I see no more than the shadows of ghosts.
visitor, sir.
sorry to come aboard your ship without permission, Mr. Raleigh.
welcome aboard.
the Queen wishes to see you.
she asks me to assure you...
I need no assurances, Bess.
I'm no courtier. Never have been.
then you should say so in person.
this is my life, Bess.
this is where I belong.
it seems to be a lonely life.
sometimes. But it's the life I've chosen.
I understand.
you ask permission to go.
Yes, Majesty.
you plan to return to your colony for two, maybe three, four years.
if Your Majesty grants me your royal warrant.
that is a long time.
there's nothing for me here.
at sea, I know what I'm to do. I know the risks.
here. No. You're wrong.
you're needed here.
as captain of my personal guard.
captain of your guard?
kneel.
Majesty.
I said, kneel.
sir Walter Raleigh.
well, you may express your gratitude.
this is too great an honor.
if it's so great an honor why are you staring at your boots?
you know why.
now you stare at the wall.
am I so hideous you can't even look me in the face?
why do you speak like a fool when you are anything but a fool?
fool?
Yes, I am a vain and foolish woman.
and you, you... You come here as if from another time. And I've...
you have real adventures.
you go where the maps end. And I'd...
I would follow you there if I could. Believe me.
the storm clouds are gathering.
you are needed here.
you cannot leave England.
for he that will save his life will lose it.
and he that will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
lord be with us as the end approaches.
we will not fear the coming of the shadow of death.
sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.
I thought I prayed in silence.
you did.
excuse me, sir. I must go to the Queen.
the man who was hanged today...
he was your cousin.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
the last time I saw him, he needed my help.
I did nothing.
what could you have done?
I don't know.
now he's dead.
I keep seeing his face. I keep seeing his eyes.
believe me, there's nothing that you could have done that would have spared him.
I'm so afraid.
we're all human, Bess.
we do what we can.
your laundress was found to be carrying letters in her washing.
not her job, I think.
how am I to send my intimate letters?
through me. And you will read them.
with respectful admiration.
am I to have no privacy?
no.
you disappoint me, sir.
the Queen orders these measures for your protection.
the Queen?
I am a queen.
they call her the Virgin Queen.
why is that, sir?
can it be that no man will have her?
let him throw you round.
be bold. Come on, you can trust him.
and jump.
when I bend like this, you take a leap into the air.
the Volta.
I require all my ladies to learn it.
you see how fearless Bess is?
you like your ladies to jump at your command.
do you think that wrong?
no. You are the Queen. You are to be obeyed.
to tell you the truth,
I'm very, very tired of always being in control.
nonsense.
what?
you eat and drink control.
is that so?
Bess.
you should try a dance with Sir Walter.
he's eager to show us his skill.
no skill at all, Majesty. I don't know the steps.
come now.
you stand like this, with your hands here.
and when she jumps, on the fifth step, you lift her.
what could be simpler?
take your position, Sir Walter.
I am to be obeyed.
as Your Majesty wishes.
hold her firmly. I don't want her dropped.
play.
six counts.
one, two, three, and lift, down.
leave us.
I want both of them left alone.
you you want till me just they know antone i know what i heard she save my life what you stop
you know.
and nobody antone - i miss you - yeah i he was
come her for a second.
so you doing okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
because, you know, someondied, someone who was...
a friend of yours, who you cared about so...
you know what, i'm getting used to it.
honky with the dread is off the hook.
how do you think I would look with those, honestly?
I can tell when you're rolling your eyes.
can you te when I don care?
Tohe.
why aren't you asking me who this guy is and why we're following him?
why aren't you peppering me with questions?
fine, who is he? - He's a bad guy.
why is he a bad guy?
because he does bad things.
this is starting to sound like phone sex.
if this is what phone sex sounds like to you, you're doing it wrong.
you have no idea, do you?
what about, sex? No, none, zero.
I do know that women cry a lot afterwards.
Okaythat's-- that's
what the hell-- Who the hell are you?
shut up! What the hell was that?
how 'bout you just shut the hell up. We'll get to berkut, aod you can ask your questions to somebody who cares.
would you just g up?! - She's totally pms-ing.
get up!
Hey, it's me.
sorry we keep missing each other.
had another long day at work, and i, uh, just need to hear a friendly voice.
you know, I'm starting to ge really confused about what I'm doing and why.
and now I have to go upstairs, and put on a big smile, and see my sister, and pretend ke everything's oy. And...
Yeah.
anyway, you're probably working too, so, well, uh, call me later.

he's doing dishes.
Why?
Jamie, I don't know. He's your ss. Why don't you go talk to him.
Hey, you wanna dry?
Becks, could you give us a minute?
I don't kn what you think you're doing, but this is my personal space.
you know, your sister watches way too much tv.
thiss the home of a depressed person.
I am working all hours, and you come here and critize my housekeeping?
I came over he because i'm concerned abouyou.
you've been through a lot. You need to take some time off.
is this because I kicked that guy's ass?
no.
it's because antonio was your friend.
and he died. And you need time.
work is the only thing holding me together right now.
if I stop and think about everything that has happeneto me, i'm gonna go crazy.
I understand that. But it's not a good strategy, jaime.
I'm noking you, i'm telling you.

no.

that's the most you've said for the past two days.

I mean, why is i\ okay for me to suddenly ditch school?
you're not ditching school.
I wrote you an excuse, so it's fine.
we're just taking a little trip. That's what we're doing.
I mean, you know, you mope around the house for a week, not taking care of yourself.
and, mean, clearly something is wrong.
and now, all of a sudden, we're on this trip.
I mean, what do you think it's gonna accomplish?
you think we're gonna have deep talks and bond?
Yeah, that's exactly what we're gonna do.

Yeah, sometimes you mistake your job for your life.
which isn't such a bad thing if you love what you do.
do you love what you do, mr. Aldridge?
me? Are you kidding me? I wake up every morning with a giant smile plastered on my face because I love what io so much.
Jaime, please, call me vincent, hmm?
who are those guys, vincent?
Oh, well believe it or not, there are some people out there who don't love what I do.
who would ve thought accounting coulbe so controrsl.
Yeah.
what time is it?
Oh, boy, you know, I've got to get you back to the room, sport.
I promised your mom you'd call.
and, uh, I believe you two ladies have some spa appointments.
watch your step, ladies andentlemen.
well, maybe we'll see you guys for dinr?
ye. Sure.
come on, nick, let's go.
what was that about accounting?
what?
Nick's dadever said he was an accountant.
it was a real conversation stopper.
okay, I'm gonna go shower and warm up before we go to the spa.
cool.
Yeah, jaime.
Jonas, I think I messed up. I think I got made.
is that what you say? This guy vincent, I think he made me.
okay, that's a problem.
Yeah, I know it is. What do I do now?
you're gonna have to take him out.
take him out where?
Jaime, listen to me.
he knows who you are. He's not gonna wait long.
you have to kill him before he kills you.
okay, I'm all robed up.
you ready for the most relaxg three hours of our lives?
totally. Let's go. Let's go.
heat wraps or...
Juvenating facial.
Yeah, your skin's too young for anything else.
right this way, miss sommers.
so I'll see you in three hours.
Yeah, we probably won't even recognize ourselves, we'll be so pretty.
I have to go somewhere.
if you (could make sure myister sts in that room for the next three hours, i'll make it worth your while.
okay.
Thanks.
I don't think I can dohis.
trust me, I understand.
do you have any advice?
I do, but you're not gonna like it.
don't think of him as a person.
that'sonna be hard for me.
I just spent two hours on a gondola with him and his son.
you gotta think about what could happen if you don't do it, jaime.
it does get easier.
that's what scares me.
Thanks, jae.
hi - Yes.
I need to talk to vincent.
I'm sorry, he's not here. I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
well, if I could just ta a look, that would be
okay, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
U're coming th me.
it's on the left.
did you do it?
no, I couldn't do it. I was nowhe near being le to do it.
you know, in an hour and 45 minutes beccis gonna walk through that door.
so can you start by telling me what I'm supposed to do now?
I need you to ca down and put him on the phone.
he wan to talk to you.
Vincent, jonas bledsoe he.
it's nice to meet you over the phone. You with me?
Yes,'m here.
the way I see it, you've got two options.
number onei kill you. The other one is you talk.
and by "talk" I mean you tell me erything I need to know to keep this technology out of north korea.
which would y_u prefer? It doesn'tatter to me.
I just need to know whether or not to wear gloves.
I understand your son is with you.
I'll talk. But you've got to get me out of here, or my own people will kill me first and my son comes with me.
done.
dad, where are we going?
little change of plans, sport.
Matt, do you wanna get my car, please?
Oh, I already called for Mr. Aldridge's car.
fine.
I'll drive.
thanks - Thank you.
what's goingn, dad?
you' gonna have to tell him sooner or later.
I can raise my son without your help. Thank you.
it's nothing you need to worry about, nick.
does it have something to do with your job?
you hear that?
hear what?
get out of the car.
Why? - Get out!
CK, get out.
dad, it won't open.
op the door. - Can't open it!
open the door! - Dad, it's stuck. I can't get out.
come on. Come on. Come on.
it's all in the wrist.
somebody tried to blow up vincent's car with him in it.
is he okay? - Yeah.
where are you?
five miles south of the hotel.
how are you fixed for transportation?
I stole a car.
that's my girl.
look, we're heading west on the road. I think we'rebeing followed.
well, slow down and see if he passes.
we should-- We should get away more often together, road trip.
shut upo - he passed.
a good tai is always from the front.
Yohungry, sport?
no.
who are you?
and how the hell did you rip that door off my car?
maybe you should be happy I did and not ask questions.
you ved my son's life. Thank you for that.
he's a sweet kid.
takes after his mom.
I think I'veost him.
maybe he deserves to know the truth about his dad.
maybe your sister deserves to know the truth about you.
it's a different situation.
hello.
did you get the plate on that truck?
well, it's here, and so am i.
get out of there and meet me up front.
we need to move now.
Vincent, let's get you out of here right now.
what about mson?
we'll pick up his mother. We can put 'em in protective custody.
you can speak to 'em after you' made your statement.
Jaime! Jaime, it's matt!
who's that guy? - The valet guy.
the guy whose phone I used to call you.
the guy whose phone you used looked nothing like this.
clean this up r me.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
it's gonna be all right. The berkut guys are on their way.
now, nathan.
I'm worried that if I keep lying to her, i'm gonna lose her.
so don't lie to her.
I don't want her to think I'm a freak.
lien, I never said you couldn't tell her.
you've got to do what's right for your family, jaime.
I found at out too late.
the question you have to ask yourself...
is is she ready to hear it?
anything has to be better than this.
maybe, maybe not.
see, here's the thing, every person who knows is a potenal source of information for people who might want to scrap you for parts or technology.
Teeners aren't exactly known for their discretion. And if
if you're at greater risk, then so is becca.
it's complicated.
Yeah.
I think either way she's lucky.
because she's got you for a big sister.
Thanks.
Hey.
how was yours?
it was great. You look great.
Yeah.
look, I uldn't tip your girl too much.
I'm sorry, you don't look any better.
that was, like, three hours for nothing.
Thanks. - Come on.
Nick never said good-bye.
no? - no.
that's okay thgh I wasn't tha into him anyway.
Oh, this tri had learning.
Hey.
Yes, it's more fun to je with a guy who gives you the time of day.
good for you.
and I'm glad we came. I had fun with you.
maybe we could do this again sometime.
what?
what? You're freaking me out. Is sometng on your mind?
there's something I should tell you.
what?
there this guy who I work with o died.
I didn't even really know him that well, buwhat I realized is it's really affected me.
was he a guy you liked or something?
no, it wasn't li that.
I'm really sorry.
why didn't you tell me about this?
I didn't want you to worry about me.
well, that was really stupid.
I know.
Jaime, you can talk to me about this stuff, okay?
I'm a lot stronger than! you think I am.
okay.
now, is there anything else you nt to tell me?
no. nothing at all.
I'd like to give that a try.
anythi else?
what are you doing?
I'm trying to buy back ur love cecause I've been working so muc yoget mead ideas in your head these days, don'you, arah?
it's the bionicsisn't it?
they've changed.
turned me intohis thing.
we thi sarch corvumight be woing th anthony anthros.
will's father?
he escaped from prison.
he tried to sell bioni to the higst bider.
am I ticking time bomb too?
I guesi just want to know the truth.
about everythng
I don't secrets, jaime.
you're not gonna KILL me twice, Are You?
d we all know thatf your traing is worth a damn,
I shoulde ab to take this croar and swing it as hard and as fast as humanlyossible...
this is whatoyou cl studyi at rachel'souse?
who the hell is she?
nobody.
Jaime, stop!
you lied to me! - T go of!
you oked me rigjt in theace and you lied. - Oh, g!
you're a piece of work, you know that? - Are you insane?
this is the thanks get for buying you those $1, 000 jeans?
wiat the hell is wrong with you? You're 15 years old. 4v what the hell do you think you're doing?
I'm livi my life, jaime. It's none of your business.
Oh, yes, it is my business.
Hey, do you know she's 15 years old? you could go to jail - you saidou wer18 - shut up!
we're going home.
what did y do to my tom?
it's my to and why does it hurt? What hpened to thseif - hlingnthrocytes well, you're an early prototype, jaime.
as time goes on, we're gonna discov countless imperfections.
that's so not reassuring.
and you're giving me the creps. You keep sring at it.
do you have a foot fetish?
actually, no, jaime, I do not.
I'm pret much just a simple boob man.
you did this sveilng your sister?
she lied right to my face just lked at me and lked.
i'moing to rhel's house.
ll, that's what teenagers do.
they lme. they get tattoos.
they have wild sex, and then knock offquor stores.
okay, your toe is screwed.
d
now this shouldn't hurt at all one three.
one.
you suck! - Re's what I think.
you cannot begrudgea teenage girl the oppornity to make out in pked cars with older guys.
It'she lying.
Is...'t this righteous indignation just a tiny bit hpocrical considering you're a $50 milln weon leading a double lige?
that's mean.
Lo_k, I don't really care so much about what she does.
I know she's gonna make stupid mistakes and all that.
I just don't wt her to lie to me because then I can't help her.
H, that sounds gd.
ll her that.
check it out. Good as new.
you're aenius. - yeah.
let's ep this tween us, okay?
su thing. - Thanks.
d i'll see you, and I'll raise you all in.

at's a lot of coin.
you know, people say th men take1all the risks.
I'm re to tell you it isn true.
you all turn out to be a bunch of scared lile boys.

is love.
I knew the game s fixed.
I'm sorry.
you owe me $27, 269.
how'd you find out about that?
your bionics represent the most advanced form of riotenology known to! Man.
it was developed proct theuman race, not spy on y r delinquent sister.
you know, I find your whe proprietary titu about my bod to be deeply inappropriate.
how's the toe?
Atake a looat thi my name is marstevs.
I'an americadoctor workg in paraguay.

they say that th wil kill me unless a gzouthat calls themselves the sons of the d sand took steve in ciudav del este two ys ago.

Oh, my god!
I'm kidding.
God, you tnk i'm retarded?
no, I don't think you're rarded. - Yeah, you do.
so what's going on with you?
well, carly vited me up to napa to celebrate h getting into l school.
b oh, ll thathould be fun.
Mmm, yeah.
we land on an airstr.
an airstrip? Is that different from an airpor well, yeah, it's dirt.
I have an arset in pce, a local cop.
He'sonna help us locate stevens ene get there.
how can you land a 747 on a dirt ruay?
no, it's not a 747. It's a little gulfream.
Really?
you okay with that?
Yeah, I'm good.
Umdo you have anti anxiety meds? Sedatiwe anything in that area?
Hi, jaime. How's it going?
you lookreat. How's becca?
Stevens is running out of tim we have to go now.
Jonas will take care of her. Okay?
we're most done.
I'm just getting started.
|et him go, sarah.
take him to thinfirmary.
you're not helping yoself.
reflexes your refles wereecalibrated through sensory neurons with yr original surgery.
th was hostility.
you noticed.
a girl likes to be noticed.
let's cuto the cha.
you're having ha...d tremors, night sweats, xiety, panoia.
even panoids ve enemhes.
e bottom mine is the medicine antos gave u barely gave you any reef.
the truth is it probably made you wor.
are you're gonna f me? My hero.
from y?
I nt nothi. Kill me let me.
you know, I ied that once before. Didn't work.
THKS time I thougt i'help.
Yobn't know how.
Willas working on an upgrade. I want anthony anthros.
you tell me where he is, you get your lifck.
you're full of crap, jonas.
and you're getting worse who made me this way?
you're a liar, jonas!
a liar playing god!
my contact hasa very good idea whe stesens is being held.
he's gonnaeet us there. Hook us up with some vranortation when...
you okay?
m scared of flying.
I couldn't gind any drugs, and I think getting wasted before a mission is a bad idea.
I st thinkyou know, a hunk of mel in the sky. Counterintuitive.
ay. Let's talk out somgthinelse.
okay.
I'm upset because I keep lying my (sister about my job.
you're proteing her. You're not lying.
if she knew the truth about you putting your life on the line,
I don't think she would be able to handle that?
I don't think I y that.
I think everybody no, the world just doesn't worktplike that, jaime.
but then how can you have tst?
trust and fu disclose is n the same thing.
you trust me right?
relatively speaking.
but what do you know about mehmm?
what he I sclosed?
this is supposed to make me fl better?
all you need tknow and that I have your back.
n't that enough?
thank you.
e- easy, ger! Easy, easy!
that's your onicand. Th'sour bionic hand.
sorry. - Okay.
we must hurry. No o can know we've met.
remember, paraguay is a compliccted place.
we have no law againstdterrorism.
d this groupas letite business interests.
Kidnapnd ransom is legimate?
all the rimeter doors are alar thonly other access is throh thebnting system.
buit's block by an haust fan.
it'll take your head off before they will.
than. We'll keep that in mind.
if they catch you, I don't know you.
my police won't lp you.
my opinion, for whittle it's worth, thiss suide.
but you americans know l tlere to know about handling these foreign situations, yes?
he's an optist.
okay, we g in, get him, we get out.
sure, easy there wasn'tbupposed to be an alarm.
just get us in.
you know iow to diwazm i\?
Stevens' life isicking away.
St do it. Trt me.
you're a machine. Dot think about it.
evenf n real, it's sll attacd.
I'd like to keep it vhat w.
vee a second.
metal warping see?
matter over mind what now?
are you crazy? What the hell are you doing?
I suggest you follow my lead or you'll be shot.
you told me I could trust you. We pyed the first dayanfxwon.

and are you god in that homily she got le virtue than she bargained for.
look, I know you d't want to believe this, but everstepf the way she had no bigr supporter than me.
hy make he your enemy?
she needs lp.
will camm up with fix bere he s killed.
swap out the nerve bundl infuse new anthrocytes.
so what are you waiting for? - She knows where anthros is.
he's been giving her treatment.
maybe if you fed her, she'talk.
chicken, egg.
be her friend, jae.
you want to help her? Help her help herself.
at least we' together.
you're out of your miod. We're about to be executed.
4a no, they'll want to make anxample out ous to stevens, orhey'll wanto me an example out of him for us.
either way, that gets us to him.
I need you to se the fear and go bioni if I told you what I was going to$do, you would've backed out...
friends yours?
I believe, Dr. Stevens that you don't believe what whappen to yo if youon't decode the contents of your flasjedrive.
which is nothing%comred to what will happen to her.
please, m working as fast as can.
perhaps you need a little inspiration wa, it's a multi - level asymtr encryption!
s gona take time.
Allah akbar.
now uld be a good time, jaime.
Jaime, now!
Jonas says hean hp you.
Anhe's g everreason to lie.
he's also a man of self - intere.
you're valuable to him.
he's playing you.
getting off watching this dance.
or you're playing.
I want you to know you can trust me.
I want you back.
ict well want something ck.
Eve if jonas could help me, I don't t2ust lim.
you trust me?
bring me pof that jonas is telling the truth.
that they made adwancements th can use to fix me
I might rememb wherhe can find anths.
take ts rope.
we'll tie him and take him.
4ttake t rop tie his has up. We gotta move.
what are y gonna do to him?
no worse than what he was going do to you.
you want answers, ght?
en when you're done, take him down to the fan room.
at about you and stens?
Whatbout me?
he stays.
what are you talking about?
you deciphered e flash drive.
you were stalling. - You re it!
what was on the flash drive?
tell me.
you.
Ueprints, materials, everything therm is to know about biics.
if you know whatwaw%on that drive, then y know who gavet to m to decipher, not to read.
this doesn't me y sens we came here to save him.
TV and we would have.
I'm not gonna say anything.
Yeah, until you're caught, tortured, or your brother is taken.
they put a machete toa pretty girl's neck < you were gonna givit up.
I was trying to save you.
take him down to the fan room.
soou're st gonna kill him, is that i\?
Jaime, go.
go!
far end of the building, fan om, i'll meet you there, go.
you let him go, he talks, u're in the crosshairs.
a target for people to catch and disse. You won't last a month.
then I won't.
are you okay? Yove been hit.
go through.
thank you.
what you did ba there.
it was stupid. I'm gonna get us both killed.
I have no plan. You know that, right?
there'll be supplies in here for your wound.
we can't stop. - No, you can't keep going.
can you get the lock?
can you see what numbers to push?
your eye, can you tell what numbers?
these are usually four digit codes.
that gives us 24 combinations.
let's try it in reverse. Highest probability.
all right.
who gave you the flash drive?
I have a contact.
when he needs help, he tells me where to pick things up.
what about the rrorists?
do you know who hired them?
I assumed it was just them.
somebody tipped 'em off to what I was doing.
okay, your body's in shock.
you really are a doctor? It's not just a cover?
Yale medical school.
two - year residency at walter reed.
specialty in espionage?
I was always kind of a savant with word games and puzzles.
how many words can you make out of theetters in yoo hoo, that kind of thing.
I was showing off one day at walter reed and a cia guy recruited me.
you don't feel that?
how bad?
the human response to a foreign object is to repel it and fight it like an infection.
but you...
aren't human?
you have anthrocytes.
the files say they're designed to keep your body from rejecting the bionics.
so they work to incorporate what's foreign and not repel it.
doesn't sound so bad.
the anthrocytes are moving the bullet.
it could damage other organs.
I need to take it out.
now.
she could be dead.
no, she's not.
she's still green.
it was your idea to send her in, jonas.
and you nearly got her executed!
you know the risk involved better than anyone, buddy.
no, no, no, willingly surrendering a $54 million bionic woman is not in my play book.
well, it got us inside to get stevens and the flash drive.
you don't have the flash drive, andyou don't have jaime.
well, how about I get off the phone so I can go and find her?
you better. And antonio?
you treat her like she's expendable again, I won't be this nice.
do not tell me how to do my job.
I'm gonna go and get your girl back.
what are you doing here?
nice to see you too.
seriously, what are you doing here? Is everything okay?
Yeah, I just borrowed these from jaime.
she home?
no, she's in napa...
with you.
excuse me?
exactly.
what are you looking for?
what you promised sarah. Proof of will's upgrades.
you told me to get her trust. I'm trying to get her trust.
you didn't trust me.
there's nothing here. No files at all.
what is going on, jonas?
I don't know.
so you lied to me?
I told you will was working on fixes, not that I had them.
apparently, the files are on a flash drive in paraguay.
how?
I don't think we knew will as well as we thought.
Ah, damn it!
sorry.
not what you want to be hearing from your surgeon.
how you holding up?
I've been sitting here thinking about all the lies ve been told.
all the lies I've been telling, even to myself.
how do you make peace with it?
you don't.
you do what you can.
sometimes you pay a price.
three years ago, a lie I deciphered lead to a bombing raid in iraq.
87 civilians killed.
another 113 injured.
I'm sorry.
so I came to triple border...
to atone.
doctoring people who have nothing.
what about the cia?
occasionally they ask a favor.
but now I only succeed at deciphering those things that I can live with.
if you had told the terrorists what you knew about me, they might've let you go.
Yeah, and I'd have given them the technology to do what?
and then who would they have sold it to?
do the files say why it does that?
it stops after a few minutes?
Yeah.
what?
it's your bionic interface...
failing...
and being reset.
it keeps happeni.
it's inherent in the system.
And?
the anthrocytes function like an anti - rejection drug.
but over time, they bome fatigued.
so they'll replace them?
on the flash drive, it talked about a five - year projection.
until what?
bionic systems cease to function.
what does that mean?
what does that mean?
you're gonna die.
you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him dnk.
so that's where we're starting.
with horses?
Mr. Ed won't drink, you grab him by the mane, force him under.
hold him there long enough, he'll swallow.
the point isto interpret the saying.
you do know your horses.
you and your sister had one when you were little. Am I right?
and anne named it co?
whatever happened to coco?
Peopleho live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
or have sex without curtains.
me, I like throwing stones.
wakes people u you're caught between a rock and a hard place.
now you're just trying to be nny.
actually, I'm just trying to do my job, which as much as I don't like it, means trying to understand you.
I'm messed up, honey.
see, now we're getting somewhere.
does that make you all warm and cuddly inside?
you should know I don't do warm and cuddly.
you're caught between a rock and a hard place.
well, we both know how that ends, don't we?
three.
three?
you can make three words out of yoo - hoo.
Oh, yoo, and ooh. Heh!
actually, nine.
you know, what I said...
I'm sorry.
no, it's good to hear the truth for once.
he's coming. - Who?
quick.
around the back.
here.
hold on to this. Wait here.
wait, what are you... - Just do it.
there is no fix, is there?
Jonas is predictable, if nothing else.
tell me you love me.
I love you.
let him go!
stand down, stand down!
Sarah, stop.
seriously, is that the psycholocal way of talking me down?
let jae go and you'll what?
help me?
let's go move move - Where is he? - Gone.
Jaime, where is he?
you were gonna kill him.
I was just doing my job.
you kept me completely in the dark.
sometimes that's what the job requires.
I refuse to believe that killing an innocent person could ever make things right.
Yeah, well, that information on the flash drive could save you.
what we were doing here was for you.
you think cause I cost $50 million, my life is worth more than his?
Oh, we can talk about that later. Give him up now.
no.
No!
Stevens is what we call collateral damage.
killing him saves you.
maybe one day you'll understand that.
you want stevens...
you're gonna have to get through me.
and this time you'll have to do it without a crowbar.
I find this inappropriate workplace behavior.

Yeah, I just didn't want to tell you. I wanted to protect you from...

I deserve to know.

I will never leave you.

me.
one card for you......one card for me.
three for you, one for me.
four for me, one for you.
five for me.
rotten hand.
you're playing funny.
you don't want...? Don't get mad.
I was only asking.
how many cards do you want? Three?
are you going to give me a break?
I have a bad hand.
wait till you see what I'm going to do. Moron.
this will be my victory.
daddy.
did you see how brilliant...?
show your hand... Don't get mad.
you, don't interrupt me...
...or you'll be sorry.
when I get married, buy me a truck like that.
I take two. And you? None? Great.
two for me.
lovely hand. Three Aces. -Swanker.
promise, when I get married.
four Sevens.
look, how lovely.
screw your "lovely."
daddy, look.
I told you, don't interrupt when I'm playing cards.
daddy likes you, but you're troubling him.
cards are like whores.
fickle.
who do you think I am?
I can bluff.
maxim Gorki is here. The Russians.
look at this. Poker.
Maradona.
hurry up, Zare. -Give my eggs back.
how much for the horns, comrade?
ten marks.
come on, five marks.
no way. Ten.
what do you want with it? -Silence. Simpleton.
it is secondhand raw material. One for five marks.
one million horns, five million marks.
sure.
how much for the washing machine? -300 marks.
fine machine. Very good.
I'll make you an excellent offer.
220 marks for the horns, the washing machine and the computer.
no way. 280. -250.
sold. -Shake hands.
can I help? -It's all right.
on that side.
daddy.
we've been swindled.
have a look.
the Russians trade water for Diesel.
what?
water. Have a look.
100 percent Diesel.
water. -The barrel is full of water.
the whole barrel?
the cold rain falls at dawn.
I don't understand.
why is she wearing spy-glasses and a grater?
some small change for the baby she's expecting.
for the surgery.
grandma expresses her gratitude.
what? -It will be two, according to the echo.
piss off, bloody gipsy.
the gate, the gate.
halt, who goes there?
hello. -Who are you?
Matko Destanov. -Hands up.
hands up.
goose, over.
I was planning to go to Hungary tonight.
to the fair in Pecs.
understood?
Hello, mister Grga, boss.
little bird, why have you returned?
I've never been here.
Yes, you have, five years ago. -Me? No.
don't contradict me. -We saw each other, but not here.
someone important relocates often.
eight years ago then. -Eight? That's impossible.
my compliments, uncle Grga.
look at me. -I am looking at you.
why are you here? And don't tell lies.
I would do anything for your father.
he saved my life twice.
in Genova, and in Marseille. -I know.
he beat up half the city...
...to get me out of jail.
he is a gentlemen.
was. May the Lord have mercy on his soul.
on whose soul? -My father's. Last year.
one day I was doing all right, the next day I was an orphan.
without any help.
lost and lonely.
no one can help me.
you were his downfall. A swindler, a rotter, gambler, vagabond.
that was temporary.
making mistakes is human. I have changed.
I've learned my lesson.
uncle Grga, I've got a brilliant plan.
what kinda plan? -A train.
a train with 20 waggon-loads of gasoline.
gasoline? What use is that going to be to me?
since the death of my father...
...I don't get anybodies' help.
that's business for the pro's.
they'll screw you. You're a freshman.
no, uncle Grga. I've got it all covered this time. It'll be alright.
I've got it on paper.
I'll show you the fax.
don't come back without a wife.
are you up to something again?
laugh, damn it.
I received an urgent fax. Everything's in there.
all the details.
birdy.
come here.
goose, over... Reply.
look, uncle Grga.
everything's in the fax.
we invest 70, 000 marks...
what, boss?
goose, the labourers can go. And you too.
all right, boss.
let's have a break.
I want to loan 70, 000 and within a week I'll return you 100, 000.
did you see that?
I see it, uncle Grga.
you sure have a lot of money.
I'm only doing this for your father.
you won't have to pay me back...
...but I do want a full report of your lucrative deal.
if not I'll send my grandsons to skin you alive.
am I making myself clear? -Very clear.
weirdo. -Millions. Maradona.
you said your granddad died.
he's in a hospital, that's practically the same.
he has a large cement factory and never gave me a penny.
zare, my son. With this money your daddy will buy you a future...
...and your children's future.
leave me be. I'll never forgive you.
Zare.
take a look at this miracle.
now that's what I call an invention.
only the Germans can invent something like that.
daddy makes a promise to you...
boy, when I'm rich, I'll make a ship-owner out of you.
Dadi.
there's our benefactor.
pitbull. Terrier.
fortune favours the bold.
ungrateful bastard. I give you something to eat and that's your way of saying thank you?
it's all in the game.
welcome, Dadi, my dear brother. -Who is he?
what the fuck do you care? -I was only asking.
so there's a God after all.
is there anything to see?
unlucky person. Read this.
you wanted to see me.
I don't wanna work with thieves anymore.
what are you waiting for? Give the man something to drink.
I've got a cunning plan. -You?
hundred percent failsafe.
it's the plan of the century.
I've got a connection in Jordan.
he sells me a train full of gasoline.
brilliant. A stroke of luck. -Well just buy it.
I don't have the money.
that's why I need you. You know the custom-house officers.
you don't need to know the custom-house officers.
the Bulgarians always say: "Brother, if you can't solve a problem with money...
...solve it with a lot of money.
have a drink.
what is it?
whisky in a gin-glass?
you don't like gypsies? Get lost, bitch.
get lost all of you.
fuck you all. You too, out. You choose her side.
no. -He's lying.
forget it. -Piss off.
suckers.
I'm not a racist.
huh, Matko? -You have always been tolerant.
I've known you since you were little. -Sorry.
I'll drink from the bottle.
no way. Cheers.
on our deal.
ain't he cute?
he's old enough to get married.
Zare? He's not of age, but he is mature.
is he honest? -One hundred percent. That's what counts.
lucky you. You live like a man.
not like me, with that scum.
motherfucking junkies. Don't you dare that again.
stop whining. Apparently you're not short on anything.
what's that to me? Tell me.
I've got it made.
I have a big house, a castle.
2500 square metres.
daddy's mausoleum. No-one in this land has one like it.
ain't it beautiful? -Very much so.
why are you crying, Dadi?
don't cry. -Why not?
why shouldn't I cry? -It's a wonderful house.
it's a shame. A shame. -How come?
I've fulfilled all of daddy's wishes. Except one:
nobody wants to marry my sister.
it's a disgrace.
don't you worry, my brother. All will be well.
we'll make this deal and drink on it.
Cheers.
Hello, Aksim?
I'm in trouble, help me. I've heard you've got a singer.
she can work miracles.
go serve the customer.
wait till he comes in. -Go water the pole.
what's her name? Medusa?
damn, disconnected again. The devil's playing with that phone.
the line got disconnected again.
I told you: it's the devil.
damn it. Go water the telephone pole. I can't do business this way.
she's getting on my nerves.
hey you. Come here.
who? Me?
stop acting funny, you're not waiting for anyone. You're following me all the time.
I only want a lemonade.
of course.
go water the pole. Hurry up. Grab a bucket.
go water the pole.
what a jerk.
pour.
I don't hear you... I don't hear anything.
pour.
now I can hear you. Loud and clear.
send that singer with the fast train.
she begins tomorrow.
and my lemonade?
you'll get that when the goose grows a beard.
music.
my dear grandson.
I brought you some clothes.
what does the doc say?
that I'll live to become 100, if they leave me alone.
and your liver? -Completely gone to pot.
you shouldn't drink anymore.
what? I will drink.
I will drink if I feel like it.
this is a hospital. Music isn't allowed here.
doctor, you've got to make an end to this.
imagine what it would be like if all patients brought an orchestra.
you don't have the right to be so cross.
it's a matter of respect.
what a wonderful life.
excellent booze. I'm on fire.
grandson, I've got to tell you something.
you don't have a mother, your father is no good.
I sold the cement factory.
up in smoke. I sold it to that crook, Dadan.
I took the money. For your future.
if you need money, go to my friend...
...whom I haven't seen in 25 years. His name is...
I know. Grga Pitic. -You know him?
you've told me about your friendship a thousand times.
a seven feet giant with hands like shovels.
he's got two rows of teeth.
one gold, the other normal.
elegant as a vampire.
music... aggression.
shoot me.
here's a flowerpot. Leave me alone, Apin.
I'll tell you something, old man. I despise death.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
boss, try to taste the difference.
our whisky is better than the real thing.
logical. Our technology is better.
where are you, children? -We're here, grandpa.
sit down.
that's enough, children.
you, what have you've been up to? -You know, I was looking for a wife.
he's been to 28 fairs. -And did he find a wife?
answer him, jackass.
there are enough women for fun and making out, but not to marry.
Why? All your friends are married and have children.
when I was your age I had been married four times.
find a girl and get it over with.
don't get excited. What was number five like? The one that stole your heart?
tell me.
my darling.
only the memory of her was enough to lighten my heart.
my darling...
that's family.
as soon as you saw her, you knew she was the one. That's what I want too.
when will that be? When I'm dead?
why don't you be a good boy and marry for him.
yesterday I had another attack. I can barely see.
again? -Again.
I beg you for the last time: find yourself a wife.
take me to the hospital to recover.
I'll get out for your marriage.
bring me a daughter in law.
OK, grandad.
cat.
black cats are bad luck.
Mincha, brother.
take care of the passenger train, I'll take the goods train.
there's the train.
one...
...two, three...
...five...
...six...
...nineteen...
...and twenty.
all's well.
this calls for a celebration.
I was scared shitless to be screwed.
the train is here, as promised.
the money is here too, as promised. You got what you asked for.
I was anxious when the train crossed the border.
is all going ahead of schedule? -You made a promise.
Cheers.
why are you hiding?
damn it, I call the shots around here.
stop, young man.
that suitcase is mine.
but I gave everybody their share.
Where's the rest?
it's all, I swear on the Bible.
there must be a misunderstanding.
you black soul!
I should finish you. -No.
shame on you.
here's the little birdy. He's sleeping.
my suitcase.
give back my suitcase, thief.
I spit on your dead.
get down, you pig.
I want my suitcase back.
I'll climb up there.
the moment has arrived for you and me......to look each other in the eye.
just you and me.
bloody son of a bitch.
I'm here.
man, this is way too high.
Dadan, brother.
Dadan, It's me. Matko.
the train is not here. -What?
did he cross the border?
answer me. Where are my 17 wagons I paid for?
it crossed the border 30 minutes ago. It's here somewhere.
here? Where? You don't lose track of a train.
somebody drugged me. I was asleep for only 10 minutes.
who done it?
he did.
it was him. -That pig?
my Bulgarian custom officers didn't see no train.
they're lying. They're double crossing, but they will have to pay.
a train rides on track, not just through the woods.
it can't just have gone up in smoke, or can it? Boss?
no way, damn it.
my dear public...
after a triumphant tour in North-Africa, Asia and Australia...
...I'm proud to present to you: Medusa.
an act, never seen before:
...to pull a nail from a beam in the most spectacular fashion.
it wasn't an ordinary fight, but more one man against King Kong.
who was the man? -Me.
it wasn't an ordinary Bulgarian.
that jerk could only pass the doorway sideways.
name? -Rambo.
a warm welcome for this young man named Rambo.
please hold your breaths, my honoured guests...
the great, unforgettable, breathtaking moment is near.
it will be burned into your memory.
I proposed an honest fight.
but he kicked me in the balls.
I grabbed him by the hair and whirled his head around. He gets angry.
I had to save my skin after all, didn't I?
you'll return my money tonight at 11 o'clock.
otherwise I'll hang you by the balls on the windmill.
so you can learn to be an astronaut.
jerk.
don't you have the money?
I'm in trouble.
three wagons were mine. I invested all I got.
I've got a cunning plan. There's a different solution.
yesterday I bought your father's factory in the hospital.
the cement factory? -I paid it.
you can always ask.
but it's not enough to cover your debt. It's only two thirds.
I've got a better idea.
you have a marriageable son. And I've got a marriageable sister.
we arrange a marriage and forget your debt.
I'll give you anything you want, Dadi. But that's impossible. -Why?
I'll bet the nail.
name?
don't lose your soul. How can you propose something like that?
your sister is 25, my son 17.
younger men like ripe women.
and that's not all, Dadi.
what else? -You know, you know.
she looks like a little Smurf. Everyone calls her little Lady-bird.
so what? A diamond is small, but valuable.
wanna bet? Doesn't matter what.
hands off.
let's toast on the deal.
no. I've got it figured now.
I know who stole my train and drugged me.
and who messed with my father and stole my heritage.
Safet. Kazatchok.
I know who cheated my father.
last chance.
the moment of truth.
kiss my ass.
attention.
one, two, three... freedom.
what are you doing?
ls this seat taken?
what do you want? -Lemonade.
hey you. -Me?
get an ice-cream.
I'm not an errand-boy.
you're always following me around, might as well make yourself useful.
don't you think so? -Exactly.
out of the way.
strawberry or vanilla?
strawberry and vanilla. Four servings.
where are you going?
are you in a hurry?
I've got to tell you something.
where did you go to? -Finish my lemonade.
shame you're getting married.
I just thought: he's young, but handsome.
I'm falling in love.
and now you're getting married.
married? Who's getting married?
I'm only thinking about you.
I'm always here for you.
it's over. Don't make a fuss.
that's a lie. Someone's setting me up.
don't lie to me. I'm too young, I don't want to marry.
prepare yourself to get engaged.
I overheard your father and Dadan in my grandma's inn.
they agreed last night.
it's a shame. Here.
Dadan stole the factory. That son of a bitch.
and now he wants me too. You know how many people he cheated.
he got the train, the factory... What else does he want?
what else?
his mother's pussy.
the Russians are here.
the water is nice.
he wants something else......that Dadan.
he wants to arrange a marriage to pay of my debt.
a marriage? For whom?
for our child Zare and his sister.
the Lady-bird.
that bawler, the midget?
she's barely three feet tall.
now I have to ask the help of my friend Grga Pitic.
you're coming with me. -It's too late.
Grga Pitic... is dead.
dead?
God have mercy on his soul. I haven't had a drink yet...
...but I'll have one now for his salvation.
grandfather.
there's my grandson.
ain't he handsome?
I'll introduce you.
Hello, nurse.
have you seen her? -Who?
the girl.
no.
the nurse.
they call her Candy.
those boobies, that body.
and that tiny butt. All so delicate.
I want love at first sight, or nothing at all.
love at first sight? Ridiculous.
the son of your deceased friend Zarija dropped by.
he came for help.
all his money is being stolen.
I've got a score to settle with those villains, with Little Grga.
we'll skin them like cats and eat them alive.
I'm coming with you. I want to see the grave of Zarija.
as you will, grandad.
it was only a proposition.
nobody listens to me. I'm talking to you.
I'm not getting married this way. -Shame on you.
miss, please.
you're my greatest enemy.
you're no brother to me.
you're a butcher.
must our parents curse me from their grave?
I don't want to marry.
I'm not getting married. Do you hear me?
if my true love appears, I'll marry him.
waist, 68. -Who is it?
tell me. Who is it?
I'll know when I see him.
I saw him a hundred times in my dreams. I know what he looks like.
I know his eyes, his face, his lips.
he's big, very big...
which big man would want you, stupid goose?
you're barely over three feet.
one day he'll come.
breast, 88. -Silence. Leave me alone.
Safet.
cool down.
when will you let me find peace in my own home?
let me go. I'll marry the man I love.
pull.
little sister... what can I do?
daddy's looking at you, little sister.
are you convinced?
I'll turn you into a fountain.
fuck you... Go on.
I'll marry the man I love.
what about your soul? -Our parents are watching from above.
they can't see anything, it's clouded.
hands up in the air.
Dadan. You're doing fine.
move over, let the lady sit.
Congratulations.
do you want something to drink? -Coffee.
only coffee? -Only coffee.
can I help you?
ask Matko, that dumb ass.
take care of the kitchen, I fear the worst.
the one who looks like a vampire and the fat one are married.
so only the little one is left.
they call her Little Lady-bird or Smurf.
that midget?
Yes, in her bridal gown.
good luck.
never.
I'm here for business.
what business, Sujka?
you marry my Ida.
I see she pleases you.
my Ida.
you'll won't find a prettier girl in the whole region.
I fed her from her birth.
we've been everywhere.
in spa's to make her beautiful.
to buy her Italian clothes...
...we went to Rome and Napels. -Liar.
I showed her all countries.
in the end we went to Sweden.
I know. To beg.
at least we didn't scavenge the thrash like you did.
how much do you ask?
give me 35. 000 marks.
grandma.
15. 000 up front and 15. 000 after.
for such a tip even I won't marry.
17. 000 in three parts? -At once.
and I don't want see you ever again.
she's selling you like cattle.
never.
carry me.
come on, carry me.
you're a weirdo.
and now...kiss me.
damn tie.
save me, grandpa. Don't let me be married.
I'll drink his blood.
take it easy.
give me that gun. Calm down.
the gun. -I'll finish him.
you should be ashamed of yourself.
give me that gun.
relax. Keep cool.
I'll teach him.
I know what I have to do.
I don't want to. -Listen.
I was nearly dead. Listen.
her brother Dadan is a war criminal.
he'll exterminate our family.
he'll drink our blood. -But she's a midget.
o mirror, the dead with the dead...
...the living with the living, the children with their father.
for two months. Then you get a divorce.
...the dead with the dead...
I don't want to marry.
I won't.
I'll prevent the marriage in an elegant manner.
Zare.
you'll get punished.
you'll fulfill your draft in the zoo.
I'll fuck your ratface.
where is he?
who? -Your grandson.
go ahead, play. Great.
where is he? Should Dadan slaughter us all?
where is my son? -I don't know. Couldn't care less.
where is he? -I don't know.
get out of there.
you shouldn't hide your shoe.
you should be ashamed of yourself.
it's a disgrace.
the dead with the dead, the living with the living...
granddad.
he doesn't breathe anymore.
grandpa is dead.
come.
he is dead.
come, grandpa is dead.
his heart stopped beating.
dead?
do you die on the day your grandson marries?
the day he marries...
grandpa saved me. He saved me.
we'll flee together after the period of mourning.
you'll need a costume, shoes, a butterfly-tie...
wreaths of flowers, candles...
definitively dead.
ah it's you, Matko, you womaniser.
you're early. Eight o'clock, you said.
Where's the son in law?
I've got something to tell you.
it's urgent. I've got to talk to you in private.
today I only want to hear good news.
I'm listening.
my father is dead.
Really? -Yes.
my condolences. -What can I do?
he can die in three days.
but he died this morning.
who says so? Who knows?
I know. Zare...
I told you straight away. We'll have to mourn for fourty days.
I'll mourn with you... in three days.
you're a wise man.
you didn't stop the preperations?
sure I did.
should my father turn in his grave?
of course not.
don't tell anyone about the old man.
it doesn't matter to him if he dies on wednesday or friday.
death's forever.
it doesn't matter when it begins.
you didn't hear anything. -Nope.
we didn't hear anything. -No.
me neither.
wait for the guests and get the bride.
as you like, Dadi. -Cheers.
he doesn't want to hear it. -What?
even if he kills us and places us dead at the dinnertable, the wedding will continue!
I don't want to.
does he have to rip my head off?
take this.
for your soul, daddy.
take his legs. We are going to the attic.
turn him aside.
get ice downstairs.
hurry up!
quick!
don't do this to me. You don't need money anymore.
put his legs on the chair.
get the grandchildren of Grga Pitic here!
I left six messages. They don't answer.
who knows where they are?
daddy, forgive me.
hold it above the bride.
hold it above her head. -I don't want to.
get away you.
take the child, it will bring you luck.
this is the most beautiful day...
...of your whole life.
a unique day...
...to say so.
the day of your lifes.
answer now in front of the witnesses...
...the following questions.
be brief. And without hesitation.
just yes or no.
do you...
Zare Destanov do you...
...out of free will...
... take Afrodita Karambolis to be your wife?
Karambolo.
Yes.
Yes.
and you, Afrodita...
...lovely beauty and so sweet...
...do you take Zare Destanov to be your husband out of free will?
she says she wants to.
let her tell. Yes or no.
I want an answer. -Yes.
so yes it is.

Zare.

what have you done?
has your sister escaped? -No, yours.
then why the fuck are crying? Get fucking lost.
stupid junkies.

searching for smurfette.
how did you call her?
Smurfette.
shame on you.
you don't call my sister smurfette.
eat shit.
dont you know who I am?
fuck you.
it's not her fault, she doesn't know anything.
she does know something.

grandfather.
grandfather? You are unrealistic, boy.
grandfather.
release him.
don't bother your grandfather, he is dead.
leave him, he doesn't know anything.
where is she? -My ear.
let go of him, bastard.
where is she? She hasn't vaporised.
tell me , suckers. Or I will kill you.
don't turn around. Look at me.
shall I shoot? -Later.
Dadi.
what are you doing here? -Dadi, I am stuck.
I have important news.
my balls are stuck.
shame on you. Repair that roof.
forget that. I have seen the bride.

Safet.
not there, friend. Further away.
the bride went that way.
I love her.
I am going to marry her.
granddad, do you hear me?
Yes, what's the matter?
we can still turn back.
I will arrange it with Little Grga.
visit his grave another time.
no, now. Who knows how long I will stay alive.
it will last.
Zarija deserves to see me.
OK then.
I said it for your own good.
Afrodita.
sister.
I will not harm you.
there she is.
my sister.
all ends well.
she is not here.
maybe she is in the woods.
what a shame the bride runs away from her own wedding.
everybody will talk about it for years.
nonsense.
I will find her. The wedding will continue.
chief, it's a shoe.
sister.
I will kill you.
wake up, we are free.
wake up. An earthquake.
little Grga, if i listen to you I will get lost.
that map is a hundred years old.
little Grga, do you hear me?
where did you find that atlas?
are you asleep?
I am in trouble.
that's destiny.
why destiny?
all this. I will still marry you.
Yes.
who could have thought Ladybird would be so brave?
nobody ever revolted against Dadan...
...except her.
I am afraid.
Why? We will manage fine.
congratulations, son. Briliant idea.
I thought it was my imagination.
but it's destiny.
and my other shoe?
we will find it. But this is one hundred percent destiny!
exactly.
I was looking for my other half.
me too.
I looked and looked, and will find her when I least expect it.
me too.
let's introduce ourselves. I am Grga.
me too. I mean, I am Afrodita Karambolo. Ladybird.
we must celebrate, if you agree.
my sister... -Quiet.
it's a misunderstanding.
why do you shoot like that?
and you, girl, you are in trouble.
you will pay.
if the girl has any debts I will pay them.
what are you looking at? Do something.
Grga.
give me back my sister.
stop or I will shoot you.
fuck off. Come here, sis.
what's wrong wih you, idiot?
and your grandfather? And your brother? You were losing us.
look what I have got.
don't come any closer or I will pump you full of lead!
I swear to God. This is serious.
sister in law...
who are they? -Put your guns down.
stop.
she is my sister. Understand?
I don't know you.
but I do know her. -And I know him.
continue your path. My path leads to her
if you are really her brother, we can come to an agreement.
I want to marry her immediately.
she just ran away from her wedding.
you can run away from a fake marriage, but you can't hide from destiny.
what a sniper.
where did that asshole come from?
put down your guns.
you call this driving, idiot?
you took the wrong road.
OK, but look what I found.
very good.
take it easy.
this isn't necessary.
how's it going, consignore Grga?
is it you, worthless piece of shit?
what are you doing here?
we were just talking.
talking about what?
are you here to pay off your debt?
do you know each other?
my last resort in ltaly, in 1982.
he was a student in my brigade.
the worst kind.
because of him I lost ground.
I live nearby.
don't you want to marry her? -No.
I want her.
we shall see.
now. -Be silent when you are speaking to me.
and you, do you want my grandson?
Yes.
and you do not object to your sister marrying my grandson?
of course not, if they love each other.
why do you look so sad?
what's wrong?
ah yes, he needs to go to the factory...
...and pay back the three wagonloads of gasoline.
do you know how much that is?
he will pay at once. -Of course.
and the wedding must start inmediately.
the wedding can begin. Music. It's my treat.
what counts, is that love conquers all.
Cheers.
has he drank yet? -Not yet.
my beautiful sisters. -I hope there won't be any complications.
do you need anything, uncle Grga?
have fun, I am going visit the grave of my friend.
the grave?
where is it? Tell me. -Uncle Grga...
don't you want to drink something first?
a refreshment. Eat something as well.
at this hour there are vampires in the graveyard.
once we are there, it's already day again.
whatever.
my servants will bring you to the graveyard.
but to which graveyard?
give me the money.
traitor.
it was only ethical.
you must have fun. Eat and drink.
your sister is happy, so is my son.
like our benefactor, uncle...
damnit.
what's the matter? -Look.
what's the matter with him?
he is dead.
really dead.
no. He will die the day after tomorrow, like your father.
the wedding must continue. I can't start over a hundred times.
am I right? -Completely.
shall we put him in the attic?
we told his grandchildren, we brought him to the graveyard.
what about the official? -Which official?
he must cancel the first wedding and perform the second wedding.
Don'worry, I will get him.
OK. We are doing well
Goddamnit... -Eat your shit.
two sixes.
there you go.
how sweet.
the more natural , the sweeter.
fifty marks.
look, Dadan...
500 horns at 5 marks is 2500 marks.
are you crazy? Do you want to stuff those horns?
wait, Dadan.
be a gentleman.
my stake is the factory.
you have lost that one already. Look, you have signed this.
OK, I still have a house.
you have lost that one too, idiot.
but you do have...
...a nice golden tooth.
that will be the stake. 500 marks, ok?
what's with the ice?
get lost. -What's the matter?
damned black cat.
I am soaked. She has pissed on me.
brother.
where are we? Aren't we dead? -We are.
I know I am not dead. -They told me you were dead.
it's not true.
they have lied to you. I am alive.
daddy. I am glad you are alive.
goddamnit.
the cow is dead, the milk is finished.
granddad.
your father is alive.
I will notify you of the agreements...
...of holy matremony...
...and the responsibility of marriage.
I wish you a happy life.
may it last a life long...
...and enjoy each others company.
you should consider...
... fulfilling one of the most important and beautiful tasks in life.
be jealous, not with each other, but on your marriage.
honor it and protect it against all evil.
consider it...
when you died, I decided to leave.
what has fallen?
very wise. There is no sun here.
forget your glasses. Hurry up.
Agreed?
I am having a difficult time.
I have been drinking on the funeral, just now.
don't forget the accordion.
in it you will find enough, to become happy
Oh no. The deathcertificate in stead of the weddingcertificate.
are you crazy? Junkie.
my reputation...
shall I call the police?
here.
everything is allright.
the signatures. First the ladies, then the men.
the ladies don't marry each other, stupid fool.
don't make a fuss.
it must happen according to the law.
do you, Afrodita Karambolo...
...Take to be your husband...
...Grga Pitic junior?
Yes.
do you, Grga Pitic junior...
...Take to be your wife Afrodita Karambolo?
Yes.
sign the register.
according to the law you are now husband and wife.
wait, it's not finished yet.
get me out of this mess. Come back.
I can't work in that manner.
there it is.
it's amazing.
quickly!
we are not married yet. -We will do it on the way.
Mr. Dadan, you're in trouble.
you always spoil everything. We must continue the ceremony.
what a mess.
I can't work like that. -Yes you can.
it must be according to the rules.
don't shoot. -Shut up.
we are missing the boat.
the boy has guts. -He is right.
zare, my grandson.
you are young, you don't understand.
what do you want from me? -I want you to marry us.
don't forget the accordion.
finish the ceremony.
sit down.
you don't have any witnesses. -Yes we do.
who? -The cats.
you dirty pig.
you smell, boss. -Fuck you.
Yes.
do you, Zare Destanov, take her to be your wife...
of course.
children...
have a good journey.
shall we drink to it like it is tradition?
grandmother.
you have fooled me, daddy.
you stupid asshole.
it's disgusting.
nice stuff.
Thanks, daddy, for everything you have done for me.
my soul is on fire.
Ah, children...
Dadan, brother.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Jesus, you smell!
they're ready for you.
Gwendolyn Harris. We've met.
Bournemouth.
but you don't know the others.
no, but I'm familiar with you.
why do you want to be an MP?
because I'm not satisfied with the way things are, and rather than sit back and moan I'd prefer to do something about it.
go again from the top.
speed up the autocue, please.
pop stars do believe in weird things.
abba believed in angels. Kelly believed he could fly...'
they said show you this.
this happened just now?
Mm-hmm.
Gladwell?
Oh, so he wasn't hacked after all.
so tweeting dick photos is correspondence now, is it?
well, you get to use the Gladwell stuff.
Mm-hmm.
bump it all up to the top of the monologue.
anyone saw Jamie?
you really shouldn't be calling me any more.
you need to sort yourself out.'
I am.
focus on Waldo, that's going well for you.'
but it is not...
he's a hit, Jamie.'
he." Not me, "he."
just do your show.'
I will. I mean, hon, if you'd just...
Jamie, hurry up.
what do you know about Stentonford and Hersham?
safe Tory seat.
so, realistically, I know there's not much of a chance, but...
so, it's a stepping stone for you?
Yes.
obviously, I wouldn't say that outside of this room, but, well, you want me to be honest.
there's no point in pretending.
is there anything in your past that might conceivably cause problems?
no.
except...
but apart from that...
well, thank you, Gwendolyn.
if you could leave via that door.
Oh, that door?
we like to keep the candidates separate.
right, yes.
idiot. Idiot!
saying he could no longer maintain his position.
a pal of Gladwell said...'
you ready?
Uh-huh.
how old the girl wasn't.
which, presumably, was the idea.
anyway, the bad news is he's resigned in disgrace.'
personally, I don't understand why anyone's surprised...
um, small change to the intro.
what?
nothing huge, Conor wanted the Jacko gag for the monologue, so... - That was my bit.
there is the Chancellor stuff, you could use that. - Bit politics.
you can do politics.
I do piss-taking.
go be Waldo.
Yes, commander.
Kelly believed he could fly, 'and Michael Jackson believed that his doctor was qualified...'
big ball blue bear bollocks.
whose mum's in tonight, apparently.
Waldo, who have you had in your cave this week?
Oh, he's quite handsome, isn't he?
I was hoping he'd nosh me off!
want to see how it panned out?
I think we should.
run VT!
Hey, everybody!
it's Waldo time!
cool! Cool!
Waldo-rrific!
Hey, kids, my guest this week is Mr Monroe.
Hello, Mr Monroe.
Hello, Waldo.
mr Monroe is a politician.
so, what is a politician, Mr Monroe?
like Batman.
not exactly like Batman.
do you beat people up?
no, I don't beat people up.
Oh, you're a pussy then?
well, I'm not sure I know exactly what...
you don't know what pussy is?
OK, this is clearly some kind of joke.
no joke, sorry, let's move on.
friends again?
Oh, hello, mate, great show.
well done, really good.
so, we'll bring him over.
you go and get him, I'll explain about...
now, he comes across...'
what you want, Miss Tamsin?
behind me, man in glasses talking to Jack Napier.
Jack freaks me out. - Yeah, ditto, but he owns the company and the man he's with is important and wants to talk to you.
he's from the channel.
go on.
honestly, all I'm saying...' - 'Is he shy?'
no, all I'm saying is he's a terrific guy...'
Jim, Jamie, Jamie, Jim.
how do you do?
Jim was just talking about Waldo.
Yeah. Liam Monroe has lodged a complaint.
toys out the pram.
and that's...?
good press.
it's so tough to get a breakthrough these days, but when it does, well, it's just fantastic.
it's fantastic the way Waldo puts the piss up Monroe.
you know, all those twats, it's punk, it's... it's...
excuse me.
well, Twitter can't get enough of Waldo, loves him.
look, I know the show's coming back again next year, but we want to see more of Waldo.
they want to do a pilot.
a Waldo pilot?
Yeah. I mean, how does that sound?
Yeah. Sounds good.
sounds stormin' Norman, fucking stormin'.
going to give it to them.
but look, we can't do sketches without Waldo.
it's a Waldo pilot, it's a Waldo show, it's got to be Waldo, Waldo, Waldo.
realistically, there isn't the budget for other animations.
I mean live action, other characters I can do.
what about the Brown Knight?
what, the crap crusader?
we can look into the Brown Knight.
but right now let's find more Waldo ideas.
the problem is, any guests we book will be in on it.
they know that Waldo's a joke, the surprise is gone.
so, we think round that.
Hey, boys and girls! It's Waldo time!
Yeah! Ha-ha!
he's awesome, isn't he?
I mean, look - sod name in lights, you're an app now, my brother.
all right, Sara? How's the think tanking going, good shit?
um, yeah, yeah, we're making headway.
good.
I see our friend Monroe is in the news again, running in the Stentonford by-election.
we should get Waldo down there.
Hey, that's not a bad idea, actually.
we get a van with a screen with the image of Waldo on the side.
like it.
and then, when Monroe's doing a meet and greet, we just turn up and just get under his skin.
I love that, I love it.
we've done Monroe.
but it was a great bit.
I'm not dumb or clever enough to be political...
why don't we get Waldo to stand for the by-election?
get people to vote for him? - He's not real.
but people have stood as fictional characters before.
do you think Screaming Lord Sutch was his real name?
we just put "commonly known as" on the ballot.
no-one's actually going to vote for him, that's not the point.
the point is, we get to hang around, we're there for the count.
well, go on then, Sara, whack it up there.
he's with a mum and baby group.'
OK. Going live in five... four... three two...
thank you so much for joining me this morning.
it's been incredibly informative and I think we should have a little round of applause for the children, who were fantastic.
thank you, Naomi.
thank you for your time.
Hey!
Hey, it's me Waldo.
Oh. I like your trainers, man!
I'd wear trainers myself but I can't cos I haven't got feet.
I've got stumps.
he's out.
Hey, Mr Monroe! Mr Monroe.
Hey! Did you get off with any of the mums?
Where'd you look while they were breastfeeding?
they got big milky tits, Mr Monroe!
he said it!
mr Monroe, don't walk away from me!
I'm sorry about this, Liam. - Hey, I'm being snubbed!
Hey, don't ignore me. Don't just get in your car.
it's a death trap anyway, look at it!
let's find out what we can about the idiot inside that thing.
sure.
mr Monroe. Oi!
Stentonford Labour Party.
right, you've got a choice of styles, so just choose one from there. Then you put your name in there.
this is like bloody Moonpig.
don't knock the free mail out.
bet Liam Monroe doesn't use some Fisher-Price leaflet app.
he doesn't have to.
day one of the campaign in Stentonford and Hersham, and Tory hopeful Liam Monroe hits the ground running.
the license fee is something that's very close to my heart...
mr Monroe, ey! Oh, oh, oh! Look at me Mr Monroe, please!'
Hey, over here! Hey, over here...
look over here, Mr Monroe...
the Conservative Party have been, er...
have been arguing for a reduction of the license fee for...
good morning, everybody. - Pardon?
why you ignoring me, Mr Monroe? Mr Monroe? Why you ignoring me?
I beg your pardon.
I'm sorry. It's rather loud.
we have argued for a further reduction in the license fee...
mr Monroe? Why you ignoring me?
mum with a pushchair - drag her into it.
Hey, you. Mum with the pushchair.
Yeah, you. Ask Mr Monroe why he's ignoring me.
why are you ignoring Waldo?
mr Monroe, what's Waldo done to you?'
we should probably just shift before this turns stupid.
I'm not walking away from a cartoon.
I'm not ignoring you.'
Yeah, you were, you upset me.
you made Waldo sad.
Wa-a-a-a-a-a-ah.
well, obviously, I'm absolutely devastated that you're upset...
WA-A-A-A-A-A-A...
let him get a word in.
I'm not ignoring you because there is no you.
you are an image voiced by a comedian
an alleged comedian, more accurately.
if I'm not real, why you talking to him?
and by "him" I mean me, knobber!
there's no point in attempting to converse with a cartoon.
Ooh, "converse," Your Lordship!
thy flowery language doth give me a right throbbing bone-on!
Uh-ha-ha-ha-huh!
Uh-er-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-uh-uh-uh!
Uh-uh-uh-oh! Huh!
finished.
drink?
I've got e-mails.
you know that's Gwendolyn Harris?
the Labour candidate.
did you read my background doc?
Yes.
why don't you read it tonight? Alone.
I'll swing by about nine, so have your breakfast first...
are you my dad?
apparently not. See you tomorrow.
.Waldo the bear left Monroe in stunned silence.
the colourful Waldo launched his own campaign 'in typically loud and crowd-pleasing style...
someone's bold? Do I know you?
nice way to greet a voter...
sorry, I thought you were...
actually, I'm more of a rival.
Hey, Mr Monroe, Mr Monroe, why are you ignoring me, Mr Monroe?
you're good at that!
because I am that.
what? You're that thing?
Waldo's not a thing, he's a bear.
Liam Monroe calls him worse. Nice work there, by the way.
Yeah, well. It's dick jokes at his expense basically.
another one?
OK. One.
the way you describe it, it's like you're doing this for a showreel...
no...
like this place is the equivalent of a walk-on in a sketch show...
Shh!
but your party leader has to show up because it's a... mid-thing...
midterm by-election.
terminology tits.
you are 12!
so because leaderballs is there, suddenly it's walk-on in a Ricky Gervais sketch show so it's good exposure.
you're not going to win, you know you're not going to win... - Come on, shh.
you're not going to win though.
of course not.
so, why not be honest?
say, "You arseholes aren't going to vote for me, "so here's what I think anyway."?
it doesn't work like that. - Nothing does, that's why everything's bollocksed.
you're angry, for someone who's doing well.
I'm the voice of a blue bear...
if that's, "doing well," then we are doomed!
I can't see!
hang on, there's a thing.
have you had a fox in here or do you live like a 14-year-old?
well, don't get too excited, I'm not sleeping in it.
shit, really?
you're amazing.
sorry?
you're amazing?
Oh, thank you!
what's up?
nothing.
are you sure?
it's just...
I haven't been happy in a while...
and this is good, you know?
hm.
can I... have your number?
Yes!
Where's our mark this morning?
we're out on the road.
Oh, hello, I'm Mr Monroe. Vote for me and keep things shitty.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
vote Waldo! Vote Waldo!
you're right. Strong Tory.
I warned you.
you know you're on Monroe turf when they live so far apart.
I'm voting Waldo!
I met Waldo last night.
Jamie, the guy who plays him.
he's fun.
fun?
Mmm-hmm.
did you tell him anything about our campaign?
not really.
not really or no?
er, not really.
look, he's OK.
he's a comedian
he's mocking Monroe now, it'll be you next.
his act is all f-this and penis jokes.
but...
don't see him again.
OK. Job done till the husting tomorrow.
some media students doing a Question Time type thing.
they've asked Waldo to join the panel.
Oh, come on. It's my nightmare, going on Question Time.
it's students, you'll walk it.
I can't answer serious questions...
no-one wants you to! You're the comic relief, lighten up.
erm, just have a look. I'm sure you'll find lots in there...
are there any particular issues that you're concerned about at all?
Hey.
Oh, hi.
I thought we were going to...? - Sorry - I've had a tough day...
right. Not even one?
sorry.
well, what about tomorrow?
look, I can't, when this is happening, I can't see you. - What do you mean?
I'm sorry.
do they think that looks like Question Time?
Yeah. It looks politicsy.
check the host.
when it comes to addiction and addicts, we should sympathise, but we shouldn't patronise.
you know, serious drug use is a criminal of fence, that is committed voluntarily and for pleasure...
look, I'm sorry, these are the facts.
Waldo, what do you think?
mr Monroe, are you addicted?
no.
sorry, I mean, are you a dickhead?
I think we have to ask ourselves...
I think we have to ask ourselves, what is this for?
and why do we waste our time with animated trivialities like him?
I mean why?
Why? I mean why?
I mean why? I mean why?
I mean why? I mean why?
this is just the kind of thing... rather than see you laugh...
they laugh at you, Limbo.
you laugh, you're laughing at someone who won't engage.
who is scared to engage, who hides behind a children's cartoon.
who you calling a kiddy toon, fool?
I'm... I'm... I'm speaking about James Salter.
don't worry about it.
that's your name, isn't it?
James Salter, this is the man who's behind all this.
he's 33 years old, a man whose career can be summed up surprisingly quickly.
you were in a sketch troupe that enjoyed minor success about six years ago, and the others moved on to better things, but your main achievement seems to have been playing the part of a corn on the cob in a high-interest personal loan commercial.
I notice you keep that pretty quiet.
and now of course operating this sort of teddy bear thing.
which by the way is easier than it looks. Anyone could do it.
see, this is... this is the thing. It's easy, what he does.
he mocks.
and when he can't think of an authentic joke, which is actually quite often, he just swears.
I think that this puppet's inclusion on this panel debases the process of debate, and smothers any meaningful discussion of the issues.
so I return to my original question, is that really what this is for?
he has nothing to offer and he has nothing to say.
prove me wrong. Hm?
speak, Waldo.
please. Come on. Speak up.
there you see, nothing.
Oh, go fuck yourself.
it's more swearing.
you're a joke.
you look less human than I do and I'm a made-up bear with a turquoise cock.
what are you? You're just an old attitude with new hair.
assuming you're my superior because I'm not taking you seriously?
no-one takes you seriously, that's why no-one votes.
the vast majority do vote.
it's bullshit.
surely this is enough?
you think you deserve respect.
just common courtesy.
because you went to public school and believed you were entitled to everything.
perhaps we could get back... - Ad hominem nonsense...
something's got to change. No-one trusts you lot cos they know you don't give a shit about anything outside your bubble.
what about your mate Gladwell, the kiddy-flasher?
you knew him for 20 years, did you not know what he was like?
no, of course not.
Yeah, cos you're all just front, like him, sly and pretending, and in that way you're all the same.
Gwendolyn Harris, is all of politics a waste of time?
well, of course I think no...
Oh, shut up, you're worse!
seriously, she's faker than him.
for once I agree with Liam Monroe in that this... - Are you going to win?
doesn't get us anywhere and there's no point in us continuing...
tell them why you're here.
if we can't have anything resembling a debate...
tell them why you're here.
she's here to build a showreel.
I'm not kidding, that's literally it.
knows she's not going to win. This is all experience, to get on telly.
she actually gives less of a shit about anyone round here than he does, because he'll actually have to represent you.
am I wrong?
a career politician. Someone else less real than me, and I can do this.
can I just make a couple of points?
Oh, shut up, you pebble.
what is this for? That's what you wanted to know, Mr Monroe.
and the truth is, none of us know any more, thanks to you.
what are you for? What are you for?
thank you and good night.
Jack's here. He wants to see us.
you can't avoid it.
get dressed, he'll meet us outside.
and yet accusations of vapidity aside, it's clearly tapped a nerve.
in just three days, Waldo has gone viral.
the video of his clash has already been viewed over a million times 'on YouTube. There are Facebook groups calling on Waldo 'to form a national party.'
you're a joke.
you look less human than I do and I'm a made-up bear with a turquoise What are you?
you're just an old attitude with new hair.
assuming you're my superior because I'm not taking you seriously.
no-one takes you seriously.
Oh, look, here he is the man of the moment!
how does it feel to be a phenomenon?
Shitifying.
you are everywhere, my son.
twitter, the news... Have you seen the poll?
you're in third place, mate.
you overtook that Lib Dem prick...
Yeah, well, he's a glass of water. - This is an opportunity, Jamie.
he knows my name now.
we could really do something here.
you know, everyone's pissed with the status quo.
and Waldo gives that a voice.
Waldo's a bear. A blue bear.
tell him, Tams.
we've been asked on Consensus.
it's a ten-minute one-to-one interview with Phillip Crane.
pitbull Crane?
big guns for big guns.
Hello? I'm not a politician, OK? I don't want to be a politician.
we know that you hate politics.
I don't hate them, I'm just not interested in them.
you don't need to be interested in them.
you just need to be Waldo.
and when Crane asks something tricky and I look stupid because I don't know how to answer?
you'll know the answer.
because you have a producer.
look, I can tell you what to say.
I can live Google any facts, give you states, quotes, whatever else you need.
so you've got a safety net for the concrete stuff and the rest is Waldo and you can do that in your sleep.
you'll piss all over Crane.
he'll know there's a team around me, he'll see it.
yeah good. I hope he does. I hope he points a camera at it.
all the other MPs have got teams, we're just more honest about it.
now come on. What do you say? Eh?
why would I want to do this?
look, the world is knackered and you can do something about it.
I don't know what you're on about.
Waldo has got the attention of the young, and the young don't give a shit about anything except trainers and pirating films.
do you have any other astounding theories about young people?
Yeah, yeah I do actually. Look, they care about Waldo.
they'll vote for Waldo.
the video was a hit for a reason.
the video's embarrassing. I'm embarrassed by it.
I was lashing out. I wasn't even articulate
doesn't matter. Or funny, which is almost worse.
we can build on that.
Waldo's not real.
Exactly! That's what you said that really hit home. He's not real, but he's realer than all the others.
he doesn't stand for anything.
Yeah, well, at least he doesn't pretend to.
look we... we don't need politicians, we've all got iPhones and computers, right?
so any decision that has to be made, any policy, we just put it online.
let the people vote thumbs up, thumbs down, the majority wins.
that's a democracy. That's a... that's an actual democracy.
so YouTube and I don't know if you've seen it but the most popular video is a dog farting the theme tune to Happy Days.
well, today it's Waldo.
no. It's still the dog.
listen, can you imagine all the things we can change if we fuck the politicians out the equation?
I've said what I've said and now I'm shutting this door.
do you know who owns Waldo?
I do, I own the rights.
he's my character.
Yeah, written for my show.
you're too frightened to take to the next level. Fine. I understand.
but also, fuck off!
and watch me fly.
you own Waldo, you can't be Waldo.
eh, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, what's 'appenin, eh?
pretty close, I'd say.
what's happenin'? Ahh!
Yeah! Yeah!
why is it going off left again?
because the...
I know! I've got my... - Put your thumb in the white thing.
I got that. In there? OK.
that's not how that works.
first tonight, a figure - or more accurately a character
who's been causing an upset in the Stentonford by-election.
unlike the other candidates, he has no party affiliation.
he doesn't even have a surname.
he is Waldo, a few weeks ago just a cult character in a comedy show.
today, an official mascot for protest voters.
vote Waldo.
cartoons don't play by the rules and Waldo's open disdain for his opponents has clearly struck a chord.
Waldo, as a mascot for the disenfranchised, aren't you ultimately neutralizing seriously effective dissent?
by encouraging people not to care, you're actively dangerous.
dangerous? You think the public can't be trusted?
no.
isn't that basically you calling them twats?
no, I...
Bell-ends then?
did you come for a discussion or...
you're snooty for a glorified Punch And Judy man, Phil.
you know you're gonna get your best ratings in months cos I'm here.
to even get close to the figures I'm gonna pull in for you tonight, you'd have to fuck a prawn sandwich live on air.
make a nice prawn cocktail.
could we make a serious political point that is...
I've got one big blue point to make, fool.
would you like to have a look at it? - Oh, God. Thank you.
great work tonight. Look at... Look at this, look at this.
it's The Waldo polling app. Now, this can pinpoint you with GPS so that when you're at a polling station, it unlocks loads of free shit, look.
thanks for voting, dickhead!
it's good, isn't it?
who's this guy we're meeting?
I dunno. But he's from Washington and he's got my restricted number.
Jeff Carter, from the agency.
and I'll leap right in.
I think what you're doing with Waldo is fascinating.
from "the agency"?
Yeah, listen. Waldo may be the perfect political figurehead.
Waldo The Bear.
the bear, people like. The fact he's a bear is an assist.
an assist? - It helps.
right. You look at human politicians, you're instinctively like, "brrrr" - uncanny, right?
like the girls in porn.
you know something's wrong, cos why else are they doing it?
it's usually daddy issues, eh?
just like politics. Waldo bypasses that.
you already know he's not real, so no personal flaws.
I'm a person.
with respect, Waldo's more than you.
he's a team, and you're open about that, which is fantastic.
the honesty thing works.
Waldo is a construct people not just accept but embrace.
at the moment he's anti-politics, which is a political stance itself, right?
but he could deliver any brand of political content, minus the potential downsides of a human messenger.
in a debate, your team could Google every word the other guy says, then let Waldo hit him with debunk stats and spit a Twitter-ready zinger into the next sentence.
he's the perfect assassin.
we won't win, though.
you guys are so British.
no, of course he won't win. You started out too coarse off the bat.
there's no substantial basis to what you offer, and the whole nihilist "democracy sucks" thing, yeah, is kind of wack-a-doo, but with a targeted, hopeful message, which we can provide, energising the disenfranchised without spooking the middle via your new platform... You got a global political-entertainment product people actually want.
you could roll this out worldwide.
like Pringles.
Absolutely.
it's, er... It's interesting stuff though.
when you're done with Stentonford, there may be an opportunity in South America.
Excelente.
what?
he's not coming.
but he's the party leader!
it's too toxic.
labour denies the party is losing faith in their young candidate.
in the Stentonford by-election, Waldo the cartoon bear continues...
did you see Gwendolyn Harris yesterday?
she looks like she's been poisoned.
because he's gonna overtake her.
we're still way ahead.
if that thing is the main opposition then the whole system looks absurd.
which it may well be.
but it built these roads.
just come in, Roy.
I'm sorry, OK?
it was wrong to speak to you like that and...
after the campaign, I would've called you.
after the campaign!
all you've done is strengthen Monroe.
you won't win either, but I was at least attempting to represent...
well I don't know! Not just "bollocks to everything."
if you were preaching revolution, well that'd be something, but you're not because that would require courage and a mindset.
and what have you got?
who are you?
what are you for?
morning.
so, final push.
you remind everyone that's got the app that if they recommend it to a friend it unlocks a little fez for Waldo.
we're here.
attention, shoppers.
I'm here to ask you an important favour. Gather round.
come over here and listen.
don't vote for me. I'm an insult.
seriously.
vote for Monroe or Harris or, I dunno, UKIP, or even that Lib Dem guy.
he's a prick!
seriously, only an arsehole would actually vote for me.
what is this? Irony?
I'm worse than a wasted vote.
he's from the Harris campaign.
I mean it, you idiots! Don't vote for me!
don't vote for me! Don't vote for me!
don't vote for me!
don't vmmmf!
shut up.
no. Don't boo him, he's right! He's right!
what are you doing?
resigning. - Jamie!
look! It's me, I'm Waldo.
this guy, whoever this guy is, he's a hero.
you should throw stuff at Waldo, he's bad bloody news.
he's funny! - He's not.
don't listen to that man, he's a lesbian. Ahh!
so remember, the polls are open, and if you've got my app, you can unlock new stuff like catchphrases and a little hat 'n' that.
only an idiot wouldn't vote for me so question the status quo!
kill it! Kill it!
kick them where it hurts.
the first man to hit him gets 500 quid!
Yeah, that's right. Knock him down. Knock him down.
smash it!

Why? You don't like it?

OK, I won't beat you, come here.
No! I... I know you will!

I may spend it all if I keep it.

here's a nursery school or what?
Kyung-ah!
Yes.

Yes.
got it?
Yes!

sit down.
I have to change clothes.
Oh... cut the bullshit? OK.
I'm not a chatterbox anyway.
why do you turn down on me?
I asked you to go out, then answer me.

I could've even had Marilyn Monroe with all this.

Yes.
OK, then.

I have a boyfriend.
I even have a baby.
I better go.

Sit! Sit! Stand up!

what are you doing?
Hey! Where have you gone? You should prepare at this time.

what the hell are you doing?
I am talking with her. Do I have to report to you?
Kyung-ah, come here.
sis...
sis? Damn it! She's your sponsor or what?
I will tell boss about it.
what? Telling boss?
you bitch!
you think I can't?
I'll tell him all you did so far.
what did I do wrong?
let's go.
God, damn it!
you think I can do it or not?
I know you can.

OK, 4000won.

wish you bad luck.
open it! Yeah~
this is Doo-il's cookie price.
Doo-il, come here.
Hey, you fucker!
no, that's for Doo-il's cookie.
fuck you! Are you his dad?
I am kind of his father.
you mother fucker!
you two are brothers-in-law then.
fuck! I don't play anymore.
what made you say that?
fuck! Winner always wins.
it's not fair.
how much did you lose? Just 7, 000 won.
he's using tricks.
you better make your son beg outside.
you better make your son beg outside.
Doo-il, tell uncle 'fuck you'.
if you say that, I will die and make you an orphan.
you bastard!
dad, I am hungry.
what do you expect from a boy whose mother left him...
let's go to Young-woon's place.
Joon-yong, close the shop.
are you kissing the lock? Come on, hurry it up.
Doo-il said he's hungry.
OK, done.
are we going? Yes?
Doo-il!
aunt!
come here!
Hey, Youn-ah's boyfriend! Make a seat for us.
bastard, give me the money you owe me...
sue me.
how many are we? We can't all sit together.
man, move those people back, and move the table too.
use your brain, man.
is your head only for the helmet?
I'll knock off these bastards...
son of a bitch.
sorry, could you move the table?
we've a lot of people.
Ddang-chil, get our orders.
uh... come here. - Come on up, guys.
Ddang-chil, come and clean here.
can we all sit here together?
don't push me. Shit. Go, go other place.
you fucker like a bat!
we pay to eat, not for free.
what is this shit?
pay? Pay my money back first.
let's get out.
let's go.
I set the table for you.
where are you going?
everybody left.
come to "AIcohol Hurrah" when you close.
are you leav... leaving?
we are leav... leaving, man.
Hey, let's go together.
tend the store. - Are you g... going too?
you can do it alone.
are you going to go out drinking?
we are going to go to another place! Get back in! OK?
bro! Young-woon!
get out of the way.
all the way, looking for Mom!!
shi... shit! It's unfair!
you!
you have to watch your tongue.
you said that, so tell me!
you're saying you didn't beat her?
who said I didn't?
I mean when I beat her on the roof?
shut up, fuckers!
on the roof or elsewhere, you do beat her, right?
you told me, I heard you beat and made her face like this.
Hey, here's your wife's face.
Doo-il, come here!
are you OK? You aren't hurt?
Doo-il, tell me.
dad beat Mom on the roof, right?
let's go to sleep. Your dad is frustrated.
you tell me, honestly.
have you seen dad beat mom?
Yes.
he said 'Yes'.
you tell me, little brat.
not in the room, on the roof!
dad beat mom on the roof?
yes he did.
Doo-il, think...
stop doing it. What's little boy's fault?
he's never seen it, but told you he did.
Doo-il, when did you see?
tell me exact date.
if he said so, that's it.
how can he remember the date?
you never remember!
Doo-il's Mom was the best for you.
live with her then! You can't say that!
this bastard is crazy.
you don't know marriage life.
you should beg your wife sometimes.
you're too stubborn.
you insist black while people say it's white.
I can insist black if I'm right.
I can't agree with what's wrong.
I can't agree with what's wrong.
hurrah Hak-ie.
hurrah Hak-ie.
hands down, mother fuckers.
no, not again.
you can't say 'no' again either.
listen to me, ok?!
you're dead. Mom'll kill you.
what, brat? I'm not late.
behave yourself!
you want to get killed?
chasing woman mak... makes you...
you frustrate me...
make you screwed!
mom, I'm home.
eat supper before leaving.
what supper... no need!
I am leaving, mom.
don't ever come again.
Bye.
busy today?
are you ever interested?
give me, I'll do that. - Don't touch that!
if you like your friends so much, break up with Soo-kyung too.
you're always saying stuff like that.
you've dated her for 4 years, and have been engaged for 2 years.
I'll marry this year.
it's too late though. Marry right away!
have you washed them clean?
chief!
you feel fresh?
what brought you here?
nothing special, about Kyung-ah...
sit down and take these flowers first.
these are to apologize...
it's my first time giving flowers to a woman.
can you just treat me as a sister?
I tried, but not that easy...
I tried, but not that easy...
I'll move to another bar, then.
you can't say shit like that.
I'm sorry, but I can' help it.
fuck!
OK then. I won't bother you, so don't move.
don't ever show up with your boyfriend.
if I see that, I'll eat you up.
let's see what will happen.
next song is "Bye-bye."
Why? I'll give you a tip.
you can push the button...
that's not fun! Next song!
sit down for a second.
Why?
come here.
when will you marry?
I said I will.
When?!
whenever I'm ready!
ready?
I know it's because of your friends!
if you marry late, it's not good for the baby.
what baby? I can't even take care of myself.
marry her right away!
I'll get you an apartment.
I'll take care of it.
be careful when you ride your motorcycle.
why did you catch the damn cold?
don't need to bother...
I'm good at this.
delicious?
Yes.
tomorrow's Min-gu's birthday...
he'll treat us well. If not, I'll kill him.
you'll bring me there, right?
you should go to school.
will you bring Soo-Kyung instead?
she finishes her work late.
we gather early in the evening.
behave yourself, OK?
what again? Bitch...
never let me notice although you date her. Got it, bastard?
why must she come when I'm out with the boys?
he's being mean again.
when did I do that?
why are you saying stuff like that?
go marry if you want, but don't talk of marriage in front of me.
how long will you do this kind of work?
if you get me money, I won't.
learn some skills, so I can get you a hair salon after a year.
OK.
stop saying "OK," just do it.
you put it off for a year already.
you should lead your life.
so, you're giving me a salon, and telling me to fuck off?
no, I didn't mean it that way...
what else could you mean?
I know you will marry Soo-kyung.
but why do you emphasize that?!
I didn't emphasize that!
you think I am nuts?
you keep mentioning Soo-kyung.
why marry Soo-kyung? Not me?
I met her before you...
a year?
then you should be engaged with me if you knew me first.
right.
you said you love me.
knowing someone early doesn't mean anything.
tell me why it must be Soo-kyung as your wife.
when I met Soo-kyung...
it's enough, shit!
she was a virgin? Is it the reason?
no one's virgin these days.
she might be a whore.
you..., fuck!
virgin or whore might be the same for you.
fuck!

get out!
don't you dare say bad things about Soo-kyung.
fuck you...
live your life as you want!
you want to get screwed?
fuck off, you mother fucker!
I've never seen a crazy bitch like you.
say hello properly, you bastard!
you know I like you.
I'm fucking pissed off.
what make you like that this time?
because of Youn-ah.
I had better end things with her.
she asked me why I don't marry her.
right, what's the reason? I am also curious, bastard.
what?
Youn-ah is best for you.
she's nice, sexy and too good to you.
we think Youn-ah's better than Soo-kyung.
you fucking crazy bastard!
you never gonna leave Youn-ah.
you need her whenever you're in trouble.
you call her when you're sick, hungry, and even horny.
you just pay back my money, fucker!
don't wring money out of woman, bastard!
shit, this rotten bastard!
stop it. Bastards!
Joon-Hee, stop! Here's a restaurant.
Hey! I bring up a gun.
Hey! Put this book back in its place!
fuck you... - Bastard!
wake up! Youn-ah's ready for our meal.
Ugh, stink!
this brat was snoring the whole night.
when did I snore?
where are you going?
I gotta go.
no way!
I broke up with that bitch. I am not going, no.
Hey!
I won't beg you to see me again. So just eat up and go.
I don't want to...
Ugh. Idiot. - Ouch!
let's go eat!
behave yourselves, bastards!
you, sons of bitches!
I love you Young-woon.
ditto, Youn-ah!
Ah... shit!
Oh my goodness!!
cool...
get back to work!
ms. Choi, how much do you collect today?
2. 5M won, why?
bring it here.
Hey!
no, if you do that again, I'll be fired.
I see, I won't get you fired. Come on, bring it to me!
I don't have a key for the safety box.
Oh my... these bitches...
ms. Kim! Go get Director Lee.
why are you sitting there, not working? Chief Kang!
Lee, get me the key, I'm busy.
what key?
cut the crap, and step aside.
why do you keep my family's key?
don't try to do that. Company is badly off.
you are so funny.
my family goes bankrupt, not yours!
shut the fuck up. Just get me the key.
go get approved by boss then!
father's not here now!
I know you're a good worker, I do know!
I will get approved soon, so get me the key!
no, I can't!
Lee! Hey you!
Gee... no...
don't bother me, ok?
I'll be laid off, no...
this crazy bitch... - Ouch!!
hold it tight, dude!
I'm holding, I like you, man!
Wow! Look at this money!
Hurrah!
Min-gu is the best!
Hurrah!!
let's go, bastards.
how much is that?
you want me to call Youn-ah?
don't make me lose interests. Don't tell her we are here.
let's put out!
Hey, you fuckers!
bring us hot chicks!
Youn-ah will get angry.
that's ok. She's cool enough.
I'm not that cool.
Youn-ah!
bring in alcohol and side dishes.
change ashtrays and ask tips, ok?
Yes, sir!
do it well!
Yes, sir!
little brats came to my place...
gals!
Young-woon and pals are here at Pearl room.
wow, really?
I will get in that room!
me too!
why are you taking this?
no, it's because...
what are you doing?
stand up and line up!
look at that slow action.
Seri, Heri, Mia, Chung-a, and Go-ah, come out!
you 6 are for Pearl room tonight.
crazy nuts... shit.
when you sing, choose slow song.
make them lose interests.
make them lose interests.
and move room to room.
when you get tired, go to sleep.
I won't bother you. OK?
Yes!
what an answer... fuck... Good luck! I'm leaving.
bottom's up!
Hey, bros, hi~
do you want us to leave?
no, you stay here. I'm leaving, shit.
no, that's a joke. Come in and drink some.
"change girls"
they are all the same. Honestly, she's too ugly.
drink up! Then it'll make her pretty.
enjoy, guys!
Why? We are fine.
chief!
what? Tell me the point.
change girls at Pearl room.
I couldn't hear that. Tell me again.
if customers don't like, we should change girls.
have you drunk? Nuts!
you shouldn't mix up public and private.
we can't afford all the beauties just for your boyfriend!
never mind, and get back to your work!
I won't work today.
Why? Here's your working place...
that's it!
what a bitch!
OK! Just a moment.
Damn! I screwed up.
Oh~! I have one!
Hey, "cigarette stain"! You'll be a hoodwinker.
you, fucking shit...
Hey, "cigarette stain"! Where are other girls?
how do I know? I'm not their parents.
these little chicks might be...
you, cigarette stain! Watch your mouth!
that sick bald bastard!
he makes me pissed off.
let's go play with them!
rain drops, my tear drops, - We'll play to death, come on in!
what the hell is this?
stop! Stop it!
Hey! Bastards!
come to yourselves!
stop!
stop bastards!
stop! Stop~!
oh~ come on in!
Hey, Mr. Bitch~ - Yes, come on...
let's talk for a while.
I want to live like this. Everyday drinking and playing...
you're living like that already.
what will you become in the future?
father, you wretch!
not everyone can be a father.
think why you live.
I live just till death, and you?
I'll achieve my dream someday.
shut up and let's get out.
be patient, you stick to nothing.
let's get out, shit.
what's your problem? Say it, not doing this.
are you out of your mind?
what? Tell me!
how could you afford the expensive alcohol?!
Min-gu treated us for his birthday party.
you go out with Youn-ah?
which fucker said that?
that's why you haven't married...
who said that?
I'll punch his lips with a stapler.
chief said everything!
he knows nothing.
am I crazy to go out with this bitch?
you are not, right?
I am not.
I called Soo-kyung to come.
it's been a long time, so...
what are you doing with one hand?
don't you like it? - Sit down. It's OK.
bro! Stop drinking and work!
sis! Go home, it's late.
you, crazy one!
he can drink today!
drink it, it's ok.
what is that look?
I'll tear your eyes.
what's you... your problem!
he's a bit crazy.
no need to talk to him.
Hey, dearest Youn-ah!
pardon me? - Hey!
what name is that?
Oops, sorry.
she might be his fiancee. He keeps calling her.
you are drunk, man. Go get some fresh air.
Youn-ah, I...
Hey, what are you saying?!
he's drunk. He really is.
I wanna go pee.
I wanna drink with sis.
you crazy creep want me to bury this in your head?
OK, sorry.
try this, it's delicious. Pals are drunk.
be careful!
Hey, you can't pee there!
I am sorry.
show me your IDs.
here you are, bastard. - You son of bitch!
go seize him!
don't touch me, OK?
show me your respect! Get me off.
those craps...
go see Soo-kyung, I will take care of that.
I'm his brother, I apologize.
please do us a favor, OK?
put it down!
OK.
they can't treat us like this, if we are rich and powerful.
he's a trouble one in the family. I am sorry.
beg and apologize to him, then he'll forgive you!
you can hate crime, but can't hate people, shit!
I'll be nice if I'm free to go.
me too!
don't turn on the light!
Oh my... Jesus...
come to me.
I'd better change clothes.
what took you so late?
I played cards.
come here.
Why?
come here, quickly!
Why? Why?
let's do it!
no, wait!
I can't do it, today!
I am have a period~
it doesn't matter.
will you wash the sheet?
no, I can't really do it today!
Youn-ah~
what are you doing, guys?
who? Me? Why did I tell about it?
it stinks...
you can ask working lady to do it, not me.
bro!
why, you brat?!
can you advance me on my salary?
what for, this time?
can you, or can't you?
how much you need?
200K won, to visit mom.
I'll give it you anyway.
but don't spend it elsewhere!
I am not like you...
come here, shitty!
what's that?
I bought it for you. Change and go see mom.
thank you, bro.
stop saying that.
if you don't go and see her...
use your brain, OK?
silence in court!
now we come, not for the first time, to Jarndyce and Jarndyce.
Yes, Mr.Tangle?
as we know,my lord, the problem with which we grapple in the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce is that there are several wills and fragments of wills, all of them different, all of them conflicting.
is there much more of this, Mr.Tangle?
afraid there is. . . a variety of points.
I feel it my duty to submit. . . lordship.
mr Brownlow, you appear for Lady Dedlock in this matter.
do you have any matters of urgency?
er. . . no, my lord. Ah.
I see that Mr Tulkinghorn has graced us with his presence this morning.
my lord
is it still raining, my love?
Yes, my love. Remarkable.
and I am bored to death with it. Ah, well. . .
bored to death with this place, bored to death with my life,
what was that, my love?
nothing of consequence.
Mr.Tulkinghorn will be coming soon.
certain legal matters to discuss, he says.
perhaps there's been a development in Jarndyce and Jarndyce.
nothing ever happens with Jarndyce and Jarndyce. No, well. . .
now, somewhat to my surprise, something stirs in Jarndyce.
it appears that the two young people, the wards of court who stand at the very centre of these proceedings, are with us today.
my lord, you were to hear my case today!
gridley, my lord.
silence in court! Gridley.
I have a right to be heard, my lord. I have waited long enough.
quiet, sir, quiet. Keep it down.
an application has been made for them to reside with their cousin, Mr.John Jarndyce.
will your lordship allow me?
the two young people are here, my lord.
and there is a third young person, my lord.
a third young person? Not another ward in court?
no, my lord. Engaged as companion to this young lady, and seeking your lordship's approval.
very well. Is she here, too?
on her way, my lord.
miss Barbary. . .
will you tell me, who am I, exactly?
who are you?
you're nobody. You're nothing. You're worse than nothing.
it would have been far better if you'd never been born. Why?
is it because of my mother?
did she die because of me?
your mother, Esther, is your disgrace and you hers.
you're different from other children, Esther.
you are set apart.
miss Esther Summerson?
my name is Guppy, Miss, of Kenge and Carboys.
allow me, Miss.
there. Here we are.
bring down Miss Summerson's box and follow us, my man.
now, will you take me arm, Miss?
we don't wanna lose ya, do we, Miss?
Oh! Have a care there, sir. I do beg your pardon.
I beg your pardon.
are you all right? Quite all right, thank you.
then no harm done.
good day to you.
good day, sir.
well, Jo, how are you?
you know me, sir. I never vary.
I've nothing to give you now, Jo, but I'll look out for you on my way back.
you're very good, sir.
all in order, Mr.Nemo.
very elegantly done, if I may say so.
there'll be another parcel of documents to copy tomorrow if you want it.
Jarndyce and Jarndyce makes work for us all, eh?
careful how you spend it now.
what's it to you how I spend it, Mr Snagsby?
nothing at all, I'm sure, Mr Nemo.
good day to you.
here we are, Miss Summerson.
this is Mr.Kenge's room.
er, take this armchair by the fire, if you will. Thank you.
mr Kenge is in court now.
he left his compliments and would you partake of some refreshment, and look over the paper if you will.
Oh, thank you, Er. . . guppy.
thank you, Mr Guppy. Oh, not at all, Miss, I'm sure.
you're going before the Chancellor, I hear.
a claimant in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, I dare say?
I don't know. I don't think so.
but Mr John Jarndyce. . .
there. . . mr John Jarndyce. You see?
he's right at the heart of the case, and it is a very great case, Miss Summerson.
the most famous case in Chancery.
gone on for many years.
some say it will never be settled, and a great deal of money depends on it, Miss Summerson.
hundreds of thousands. Millions, some say.
I have heard of it, Mr Guppy, but I don't understand it at all.
it's about a will, Miss. Or a number of 'em.
a long time ago, a man named Jarndyce made a great fortune, but he seems to have made more than one will.
so, no one knows who should get the money, and it's been in dispute ever since.
there are lots of claimants, and the claims get passed down through the generations.
there's two young people appeared in court today and they are at the heart of it, like your Mr John Jarndyce.
they say one of 'em may get the lot, but you never know.
you may have a claim yourself, Miss Summerson, if Mr Jarndyce has sent for you.
and, may I say, I wish you the very best of good fortune, Miss Summerson.
thank you, Mr Guppy.
er, you see there's a looking-glass there on the wall?
yes?
in case you should want to look at yourself after the journey, as you're going before the Chancellor.
er, not that it's requisite, I'm sure.
it's very much to the contrary, if I may say so.
Oh, no. Oh.
mortifying.
it's only an ink-stain, is it not, Mr Guppy?
that must be a regular hazard,
I would have thought, in your line of business.
don't upset yourself, I beg you.
you're very kind, Miss Summerson.
kinder than I could have. . .
miss Summerson.
Ah, Mr Kenge. Miss Summerson.
shall we go before the Chancellor?
mortifying.
miss Clare? Miss Ada Clare?
well, well.
you are a ward of court, Miss Clare.
do you know what that means?
I'm not sure that I do, sir.
you and Mr Carstone, both being orphaned, you have been placed under the jurisdiction of the court.
as claimants in the case, as direct descendents of the original John Jarndyce of Bleak House in Hertfordshire, now long deceased, you may inherit a very great deal of money, one or both of you, when this case is settled.
in the meantime, your cousin, also called John Jarndyce, also residing at Bleak House, has undertaken to take care of you.
are you willing to go to Bleak House, Miss Clare?
Yes, sir.
it sounds dreary to me.
not dreary at present, my lord.
mr Richard Carstone? Yes, my lord.
do you think that you will be happy under the roof of Mr John Jarndyce of Bleak House?
I'm sure I shall, my lord.
though you have never met him?
hmm.
mr John Jarndyce is a man of good character, I suppose?
of excellent character and high standing in the community, my lord.
he has the means to look after these two young people?
no matter what the outcome of the case, he is a man of considerable means.
is he married?
he is not, my lord.
hmm.
if I might remind your lordship,
mr Jarndyce provides a suitable companion for Miss Clare.
this is the young lady, Miss Summerson.
I see.
very well.
I shall make the order.
well, what a day this has been.
only yesterday, on the old school bench construing Latin verses, today I'm Mr Richard Carstone, heir to a fortune.
so where do we go next, Miss Summerson?
don't YOU know? Not in the least.
we're like the babes in the wood.
have you known each other very long? Not very long.
we met each other half an hour before we met you, Esther, but we're the best of friends already.
I'm sure all three of us shall be.
Oh! The wards in Jarndyce.
very happy, I'm sure, to have the honour.
it's a good omen for youth and hope and beauty to find themselves in this place and not know what's to come of it.
I was a ward myself, you know.
of course, my case was nothing like so grand as yours, but I expect a judgement shortly, on the Day of Judgement.
now don't be troublesome, Miss Flite, there's a good soul.
Ah, here's your cab. You're to lodge with Mrs Jellyby tonight.
a good soul, and a great philanthropist. Guppy will take you.
Ah, yes, indeed.
well, Miss Clare and Mr Carstone.
miss Summerson.
up we go. We all in?
off we go, driver.
walk on.
Clamb?
fetch the Jarndyce documents.
going down to Chesney Wold, sir?
Mmm. A fine house, I understand, sir.
very fine house, very great family.
a great privilege to serve Sir Leicester Dedlock, Clamb.
and Lady Dedlock, sir.
a great beauty in her day, sir.
Mmm, a beauty.
not from a great family, but a beauty, as you say.
that's the world.
fetch the papers, Clamb.
right you are, Mr Tulkinghorn.
mr Guppy, whatever's the matter?
don't be frightened, Miss.
one of the young Jellybys has got his head through the railings.
Oh, poor child. Oh, never fear.
I'll pull him out, Miss Summerson.
Oh. Move.
no go. I'll try again.
mr Guppy! Mr Guppy. Would it not be better to push?
where his head will go, the rest of him will follow.
Oh, excellent thought, Miss Summerson.
gently, don't be frightened.
er, wriggle your shoulder a little bit sideways.
there, that's it. There, we got him!
Ah, Miss Clare. Miss Summerson.
mr Carstone. Do please, come inside.
this way, my dears.
you find me, as usual, very busy.
my Africa project employs my whole time.
we hope by this time next year to have 200 families cultivating coffee, and educating the natives of Borrioboola-Gha.
great work, great work.
my husband, Mr Jellyby, does not appear to be here.
but here is my eldest daughter Caddy, my amanuensis.
do please sit while I, er. . .
where were we, Caddy?
I'm sure YOUR thoughts have often turned to Africa, Miss Summerson.
the finest climate in the world. Caddy?
Mrs Jellyby presents her compliments to Mrs Swallow. . .
ma. Now what is it?
no, Peepy, not on any account.
mama is busy.
you, Mrs Swallow, I know, share my deeply held conviction about Africa, the essential Brotherhood of Humanity, and it is with this understanding. . .
I can't keep up, Ma. Go slower.
and. . .
it is with this understanding. . .
you've been working late.
no need to tell me that.
I wish Africa was dead.
look at my fingers. It won't come off.
she's very pretty. Yes, she is.
she's an orphan, ain't she?
Yes. I wish I was an orphan.
ma's a disgrace. I wish I was dead.
I wish we were all dead. It would be a great deal better for us.
don't tell me it wouldn't, it would. Caddy, I'm sure. . .
I'm so angry with Ma. She makes such an ass of herself over Africa, and Pa does nothing at all.
really, Caddy, I don't think you should speak of your parents like that.
I know I am a disgrace, Miss Summerson.
I wish I'd had you to teach me better manners, but I've got to make the best of myself as I am.
you're shocked, I dare say.
well, so am I.
I wish. . . well, never mind.
Goodnight.
here we are, my beauties!
hope. Joy.
youth. Ah. . .
peace. Rest. Life.
Oooh, shh, shh, shh, shh. . .
dust. Ashes. Waste.
want. . .
ruin, Despair.
madness.
death.
cunning and folly.
we shall all have a judgement on the Day of Judgement.
plunder, Precedent, Jargon, Gammon and Spinach.
and then you shall sing to your heart's content, my little ones.
Oh!
and we'll all come to judgement one day soon.
morning. Off to court then, Miss Flite?
as you see, Mr Krook. And your rent?
very soon, Mr Krook, very soon.
on the Day of Judgement, yeah?
Oh, long before then, I'm sure.
all right, Lady Jane?
she could tear a person to tatters if I set her on.
do you know, she was sold to me for her skin.
it's a very fine one as you see.
didn't have it in me heart to skin her.
not like the Court of Chancery, eh?
not as long as I get what I'm owed.
mr Krook, I have met the wards in Jarndyce.
wards in Jarndyce, is it?
such beautiful creatures.
so full of youth and hope and beauty.
Oh, and they won't have it long.
that Jarndyce and Jarndyce eats them all up.
it's like being ground to bits in a slow mill.
it's being drowned by drips and going mad by grains.
look how poor Tom Jarndyce ended up.
mr Krook, don't speak of it.
come in my shop, right where you stand, a pistol in his hand.
please, Mr Krook.
Oh!
mr Nemo.
good morning, Miss Flite.
mr Krook.
er, forgive me but I'm rather pressed for time.
rent, Mr Nemo. Six weeks.
as long as that?
well, you shall have it.
Yeah, that's all very well, but when?
you will be paid, Mr Krook.
you have my word.
now excuse me.
Oh, he's such a gentleman.
a gentleman? That's no use to me.
some people say that he sold his soul to the devil.
but if he has, I don't know what he done with the money!
my very best remembrances to my good friend Mr Jarndyce.
you won't forget me, will you, Miss Summerson?
come, Caddy, we have work to do.
OK, driver.
go on, move on.
we have a visitor.
can you see who it is, my love?
Tulkinghorn. Ah.
mr Tulkinghorn. Sir Leicester.
good of you to come all this way.
my lady's case has been again before the Chancellor, has it? Yes.
it was on again yesterday, my lord.
my lady.
it would be useless to ask, no doubt, whether anything has been done.
nothing that you would call anything has been done.
nor ever will be. Mmm.
well, a long Chancery suit is very much in the way of things, my dear.
hardly be proper if it weren't.
indeed, my lord. Now, as a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file, and as I proceed upon the principle that my client should be fully possessed of all the new developments in the case. . .
all right, Mr Tulkinghorn.
I, er. . . I have the papers here, if I might. . .
thank you.
in Chancery, between John Jarndyce. . .
mr Tulkinghorn, please.
omit as many of the formal horrors as you can.
as your ladyship pleases.
who copied that? Hmm? Whose handwriting is it?
I regret to say I have no idea, my lady.
is this what you call law-hand?
why do you ask?
anything to vary this detestable monotony.
Oh, go on, do.
very well. Er. . .
in the matter of the will, or wills, of the aforesaid John Jarndyce. . .
my lady? What's the matter?
my dear, what is it? What's the matter?
lady Dedlock is ill, sir.
I'm just. . . faint. Help Lady Dedlock to her room.
careful. Careful, gently now.
heat of the fire, perhaps.
far too much for her.
I mean it! Nemo, no more excuses!
the money by tomorrow or you're on the street!
thank you, sir.
those papers I took down to Lady Dedlock at Chesney Wold, where were they copied?
that depends, Mr Tulkinghorn.
they came from several of our regulars.
well, that one, for instance.
I'll check, sir.
it may take a while. I have to compare the hand.
thank you, Clamb.
Ada, my love. Esther, my dear.
you are welcome. I rejoice to see you.
come inside and get warm.
Rick, if I had a hand to spare at present, I'd give it to you.
come in. Come in.
there. Now, make yourselves comfortable, warm yourselves.
now, Rick, I have that hand at liberty.
a word in earnest is as good as a speech.
I am heartily glad to see you.
you are at home.
you're very kind, sir. We're much obliged to you.
now, come and see your rooms.
I wish you'd come away from the window, my love.
you must take care for your health.
we don't want you fainting again.
I am perfectly well.
you're still pale, I'm afraid. Is it any wonder?
we have not see the sun for months. Mmm.
I think I should take you away for a while.
Paris, now.
a change of scene that will lighten both our spirits.
what do you say?
you are too good to me. No, no.
no, no, no.
not at all.
do you think we shall be happy here, Esther?
I think we have been very fortunate.
bleak House is not so bleak after all.
and do you like Mr Jarndyce?
I think he is a very singular man indeed.
is that good?
I hope so, we are here now for good or ill.
Esther, why do you think he's taken us into his care?
well, perhaps it is nothing but kindness.
he has made it very difficult for us to ask, since he behaves as if we are all old friends.
it is strange.
but perhaps we shall be good friends.
do you think we shall, Esther?
I am sure we shall, Ada.
yes?
miss Summerson? For you, Miss, if you please. The housekeeping keys.
the master said to bring them to you, then tomorrow morning I'm to show you the presses and the things they belong to.
for me?
Really?
thank you. Er, and you are. . . ?
Harriet, Miss. Thank you, Harriet.
you're nobody.
you're nothing. You're worse than nothing.
it would have been far better if you'd never been born.
Esther, what is it? Nothing.
I'm surprised anyone should trust me so much, knowing me so little.
shall we go down?
as far as worldly matters are concerned,
I am but a child, a perfect child.
Ah, our little party is complete.
Ada, Esther. . .
allow me to introduce myself. Harold Skimpole.
a dear friend and house guest, for the present, of Mr Jarndyce.
now, you ask my profession.
no profession whatsoever.
I have no aptitude for worldly affairs, none at all.
there, that's Harold Skimpole for you.
how do you do, Mr Skimpole?
very well indeed. . .
thanks to my excellent friends, of whom John Jarndyce is one of the very best and kindest.
well. . .
shall we go in? Miss Clare, would you do me the honour? Hmm?
will you wait there, please, sir?
I'll go and ask the housekeeper.
mr Guppy? I've never heard of him.
my lord and Lady Dedlock are away in Paris, sir.
they left this afternoon. The house is all shut up.
Ah, er, my principal, Mr Kenge, has letters of affidavit for Lady Dedlock's attention.
you can leave them with me, sir, I'll see she gets 'em.
Ah, right.
er, begging your pardon most profoundly for the unsociable lateness of the hour, owing to my having got lost in very unfamiliar country,
I wonder, ma'am, if I might. . . throw myself upon your mercy.
you want to be allowed to stay the night?
in a word, ma'am.
all right, Mr Guppy. So long as you don't mind sleeping with the boots.
show him the way, Rosa.
I covet nothing.
possessions are nothing to me. I live as innocently as a child.
forgive me, sir, did you never. . . wish you had a house of your own, and a wife and children of your own?
why, bless you, my dear fellow.
I have a wife, and children.
well, half a dozen I should say, or more.
and love them very dearly.
but how do you look after them?
look after them?
well, how could I?
you see, I have no aptitude for work of any kind.
none whatsoever.
my friend Skimpole needs somebody to look after him.
then how do your children live, sir?
do you know, I've no idea.
but live, they do, somehow or other.
it's no use asking me how these things are done.
I am a child, a perfect child, in these matters.
I think your life must be a very pleasant one, Mr Skimpole.
well, yes, you might think that.
a lovely young creature like that.
we will not call her an orphan.
she. . . is a child of the universe.
the universe makes rather an indifferent parent, I'm afraid.
Oh, I don't know. I think I do know.
well, this is something, I should say.
the portrait is of Lady Dedlock as a young woman.
it's considered a perfect likeness, and the best work of the master.
dear me! That's Lady Dedlock, is it?
blest if I can ever have seen her. . .
yet I know her.
I'm dashed if I don't think. . .
I must have had a dream of that picture, you know?
if you please, Miss, Mr Carstone said would you come to the dining room.
mr Skimpole's been took, Miss.
took? Took, Miss. Sudden.
Oh. I understood you were. . .
you are not ill, Mr Skimpole?
not in the least, Miss Summerson.
we thought you might be able to advise us, Esther.
this gentleman is Mr Neckett.
mr Skimpole has been arrested for debt.
are you arrested for much, sir?
my dear Miss Summerson, I don't know.
er, some pounds, odd shillings and a ha'penny were mentioned, I think.
24 pound, 16 and seven pence half penny, that's what it is.
what will happen if the money is not produced, sir?
jail. Or Coavinses.
er, may I ask what is. . .
Coavinses, Miss? Halfway house for debtors, Miss.
I thought, you see, that Mr Carstone might, or his beautiful young cousin, might sign some sort of a bond or pledge.
not a bit of it.
it's cash or Coavinses. Make your mind up.
one moment, please, Mr Neckett.
why are we drawn into this?
he feels a delicacy about applying to Mr Jarndyce. . .
done it too many times before, no doubt.
he has no right.
I know, but what are we going to do?
I think we must pay the man, if we can.
I have 10 Mr Kenge gave me.
I must try what that will do.
I have 15 and a few shillings.
my life savings.
Esther.
and this is the laundry room, Miss.
thank you, Harriet.
everything is just as it should be. Thank you, Miss. Esther?
would you step in here a moment?
sit down, my dear.
this, you know, is the Growlery.
when I'm out of humour, I come here and growl.
then you must be here very seldom.
you don't know me.
when I'm deceived or disappointed, when the wind is in the east. . .
er, now. . .
what is this I hear about Rick and yourself and Mr Skimpole last night?
are you angry with us? No! You?
no, bless you, no!
to get hold of the pair of you and squeeze you like a couple of young oranges, that was very bad of him.
but there must be no more of it, Esther.
if I choose to support him, that's another thing altogether. 15, was it?
here you are.
and keep it safe.
safe from our friend Skimpole's inexperience. Hmm?
thank you.
what is it, Esther?
I don't understand why you're so good to us.
well. . .
that's easy.
in your case, I. . .
I hear of a young woman without a protector, and I take it into my head to be that protector.
and Richard and Ada?
they've gone into this dreadful thing through no fault of their own.
they need help to guide them through it.
through Chancery?
I wish I could guide them far away from it.
Jarndyce and Jarndyce has ruined better men than me.
the years go by, the claims are passed down generations, and we can't get out of it, none of us, on any terms.
my great uncle, Tom Jarndyce, was brought to despair by it and. . .
blew his own brains out.
I was his heir. This was his home.
when I came here it was bleak indeed.
and when I brought what remained of him come here, I thought the brains of the house had been blown out too.
it was so shattered and ruined.
then you must have made great changes, sir.
Yes, yes, and in myself, too, as far as I've been able to.
but I determined never to be drawn into this case, with its false hopes and ruined expectations.
I am fortunate I have enough to live upon, and to help others, too, without tormenting myself with dreams of. . .
well, I told you this was the Growlery, and I think we may have done with it for one day.
I am very glad to have you here with me, Esther.
you and. . . Rick and Ada.
do you think that you will all be happy here?
Yes, sir, I think so.
and is there anything I could do to make you more. . . sure of that?
I have been told that I was my mother's disgrace, and she is mine.
do you know what was meant?
I assume what was meant is that I was born out of wedlock.
but I should like to know who my mother was .and whether she still lives. Ah.
I can't tell you
your aunt chose not to tell you and her secret died with her.
it may be for the best.
hmm.
gallant conduct.
bravery.
you don't see this one very often.
your own, sir, are they?
how much? To pawn, or sell outright?
sell outright.
eight pound.
those papers, Mr Tulkinghorn, that you took to Lady Dedlock, the one you were interested in.
it was copied at Snagsby's.
you quite sure of that?
was there some complaint about them, sir?
none at all.
quite the contrary. That's all, Clamb.
Mrs Pardiggle has threatened to call.
I'm afraid she may insist on taking you on her rounds.
what rounds would those be, sir?
charitable rounds, Rick.
will you be embarking on this charitable expedition, Mr Skimpole?
I? Oh, no.
well, I have nothing to give, but myself.
and Mrs Pardiggle I find a woman best admired, er, from a distance.
what's the cause we're engaged on, Mrs Pardiggle?
visiting a poor family of brick makers.
the father is a very bad character, but I believe I have made great strides with them already.
they love to see me, you know.
come in, come in.
well, my friends, I am here again.
there ain't any more of you, is there?
you won't put me off, good people.
I enjoy hard work, and the harder you make mine, the better I like it.
now, did you read the little book I left with you?
no. I've been drunk for three days.
if I had the money, I'd have been drunk four.
have I been to church? No, I ain't.
how did my wife get that black eye?
why, I gives it to her.
and if there's anyone else who wants one, you say the word.
well, if that's the way, perhaps we should move on.
there are others more deserving of our attention.
is there anything we can do?
would you like a doctor for the baby?
I think it's gone too late for that, Miss.
we can do no more for now, Esther.
damn you, boy!
sorry, sir, I. . .
damn your sorry, you little blackguard.
leave it! Or you will deal with me!
well, Jo, how are you?
not so bad, thanks, sir.
here.
take care of yourself, Jo.
well, here you are.
how did you like Mrs Pardiggle's charity?
not at all, sir.
Oh, Lord, I shouldn't have let you go.
you're distressed.
our distress is nothing. But theirs is. . .
can nothing be done to help them?
I think something must be done.
but now, Esther, if you feel up to it, you have a visitor. A visitor?
for me?
a Mr Guppy. Mr Guppy?
of Kenge and Carboys? Mmm.
doesn't it concern us all?
miss Esther Summerson, on a personal and confidential matter, he said.
miss Summerson.
will you take some refreshment?
no, thank you.
I'll take a glass of wine.
miss Summerson. . .
er. . .
what is it, Mr Guppy?
my present salary is two pound a week, and I expect a further rise of five shillings.
my mother has a little property, which takes the form of a small life annuity.
mr Guppy, I don't understand. . .
er, Miss Summerson. . .
in the mildest language. . .
I adore you.
now would you be so kind as to allow me to make a declaration. . .
to make an offer?
get up, please, Mr Guppy.
I won't hear any more unless you do.
I will, Miss.
as I love and honour, so likewise I obey.
I'm sorry, Mr Guppy, but I can't marry you. It's out of the question.
I'm aware that, in a worldly point of view, my offer may seem a poor one. . .
no, it isn't that, Mr Guppy. . .
but I have been brought up in a sharp school.
I've ferreted out evidence, and got up cases.
what means might I not find of advancing your fortunes, if I had your confidence, and you was to set me on?
please stop, Mr Guppy. . .
I have walked up and down, of an evening, opposite Jellyby's, only to look upon the bricks that once contained thee.
miss Summerson, have pity on me.
mr Guppy, I don't want to disappoint you, or to cause you pain, but you must understand that I don't. . ..and couldn't love you.
I thank you for your good opinion of me.
and that is your final answer?
Yes.
er, half a minute, Miss. . .
in case you should think better at any time, for MY feelings can never alter. . .
mr William Guppy, 87 Penton Place, will suffice.
my card.
without prejudice.
my angel.
bless my soul, sir. Mr Tulkinghorn.
I want half a word with you, Snagsby. Jarndyce and Jarndyce.
everything's satisfactory, I hope, Mr Tulkinghorn?
you copied some affidavits in that cause for me lately.
Yes, sir.
there was one of them, the handwriting of which is peculiar.
who copied this? Ah.
we gave this out, sir. It'll be in the book.
Jarndyce. Here we are, sir.
this was given out to a writer who lodges just opposite. Name of Nemo.
Nemo? Nemo is Latin for "no-one."
he lodges just opposite? Above Krook's bottle shop.
will I take you there?
no trouble. No trouble at all, sir.
no, Snagsby, that will not be necessary.
I was simply curious, that's all.
good evening, Snagsby.
good evening, Mr Tulkinghorn. Much obliged to you.
all right, Lady Jane.
mr Krook? That's me.
is your lodger within?
male or female? Male.
he's in.
did you want to see him? Yes.
then you'd best go up.
second landing. End on the left.
thank you.
mr Nemo?
are you there?
opium.
mr Nemo?
Hello, my friend.
the man called Nemo, Mr Tulkinghorn.
he pawned some medals the day he died.
one of them was inscribed with the name of Captain Hawdon. Hawdon!
a welsher! A bilker! A defalcator!
owes me hundreds of pounds, and gone to ground.
bad debt. Bad debt. I hate 'em !
you, boy. Come here. Here!
I ain't done nothing, sir.
what do you do here?
let the boy go, Mr Tulkinghorn.
you're frightening him.
he is the very kindest of physicians in all the world.
he will have his reward on the Day of Judgement.
I shall never be a person of consequence.
no? Well, you'll have to allow me to disagree with you, then.
I think you like Mr Woodcourt a great deal, don't you?
I did.
Oh, Ada, if only life could be like this all the time.
well, it could, couldn't it? Perhaps.
I love him so much, Miss Summerson.
Oh, Lord, that's his dad.
strike home, sir. Strike home.
delighted to welcome you to the mysteries of our profession, Mr Carstone.
richard Carstone, MRCS.
I suppose there is rather a lot of blood. But don't let me discourage you.
I've been thinking that the law is the boy for me. The law?
tell you the truth, I can't make head nor tail of it.
and, er, what profession have you settled upon this time?
the Army, sir.
all these costs, costs, costs and nothing is done.
nothing is for nothing, as they say.
might I ask, Miss Summerson, what your family was?
I never knew my mother or my father, Mrs Woodcourt.
this is to be hushed up if it can be.
I am not sure that I could do that, Mr Tulkinghorn.
you must, Lady Dedlock.
for the sake of the family honour, you must.
Hey.
your CELL PHONE JUST RANG.
well, WHO WAS IT?
didn't KNOW I WAS ALLOWED TO ANSWER YOUR PHONE.
that WAS THE SQUAD. IT WAS A HOMICIDE.
they're SENDING A UNIFORM TO PICK ME UP IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.

Hey, LISTEN, WHAT WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN, BEFORE ABOUT YOU NOT BEING ALLOWED TO ANSWER MY PHONE?

I HAVE TO GO TO WORK, AND SO DO YOU.

and HE'S GOT CALLS TO AND FROM A SONNY FAMIGLETTI.
Really? THAT'S YOUR INFORMANT, RIGHT?

we HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT RECENTLY BECAUSE HE SOMEHOW CAME INTO SOME BLOW,
which WASN'T HIS GAME, AND HE WAS DEFINITELY TRYING TO OFFLOAD IT AND
which I WOULD'VE GOTTEN YOU AWARE OF EVENTUALLY, REGARDLESS.
you KNOW THAT. OKAY, SO AFTER YOU AND ME TALK, I GET AHOLD OF HIS GIRLFRIEND DEBBIE.
I DON'T LIKE DEBBIE, OKAY? IF YOU ASK ME, SHE'S BAD NEWS.
and JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR, I HAVE NO PROBLEMS THROWING HER UNDER A BUS, OKAY?
all RIGHT. WE CAN DO THIS ANYTIME YOU WANT. OKAY, GREAT.
so I ASKED DEBBIE, I SAY, "DEBBIE, DID YOU HEAR THAT BUD'S BEEN KILLED?
and SHE SAYS, "OH, YEAH, I HEARD. BUT, UH, LISTEN, "ALL I REALLY WANNA DO "IS GET RID OF THE COKE THAT WE HAVE.
that's ALL SHE CARED ABOUT.
is SHE AWARE OF THE FACT THE COPS ARE LOOKIN' FOR HER?
no. WE WANNA TALK TO HER, SONNY.
I TOOK CARE OF THAT. CHECK THIS OUT.
this IS WHAT I'M THINKING.
you POP HER FOR POSSESSION.
now THIS GIVES YOU THE LEVERAGE YOU NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE KNOWS AS FAR AS WHO KILLED MY COUSIN.
so I SET UP A BUY WITH HER IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
you DID WHAT?
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THIS IS A MURDER INVESTIGATION.
Yeah, I KNOW. IT'S MY COUSIN WHO'S DEAD.
Yeah, I REALIZE THAT, BUT I ASKED YOU TO LOOK INTO THIS.
I DID NOT ASK YOU TO PLAY SHERIFF.
this IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF YOU THINKIN' TOO MUCH!
we've BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE! OKAY, BUT I GOT HER ON THE PHONE, OKAY?
she WANTS ME TO LINE UP A BUYER.
things ARE GOIN' LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW?
I HAD TO THINK FROM THE SEAT OF MY PANTS HERE, OKAY?

I MEAN, I GUESS WE COULD GET A DETECTIVE TO POSE AS A BUYER. YEAH.

I WENT AHEAD AND I TOLD HER THAT THE, UH, BUYER WAS A BLIND GUY.

right, WHO CAN'T SEE WHO HE'S SELLING TO AND HE CAN'T IDENTIFY THEM LATER ON TO THE COPS.
you SEE? IT'S PERFECT!
I MEAN, I'M SURPRISED IT'S NOT DONE MORE OFTEN.

no WAY! I DON'T KNOW YOU.
I ONLY WORK WITH DUNBAR.
Sonny! IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
they'll BE ABLE TO TELL YOU'RE NOT BLIND. I DON'T SEE WHY WE'RE JUMPIN' THROUGH HOOPS IN THE FIRST PLACE.
why DON'T WE JUST SNATCH HER ASS UP WHEN WE GET TO THE DINER?
we're ASSUMING SHE'S GOT THE COKE ON HER, RIGHT? WE COULD DO THAT.
but WHY NOT GET HER FOR INTENT TO SELL?
we'll HAVE MORE AMMUNITION TO USE AGAINST HER LATER.
that MAKES BETTER SENSE, BUT I'M STILL NOT SO SURE
you SHOULD BE DOIN' THIS AT ALL.
look, IT'S NOTIKE I'M GOIN' IT ALONE.
I GOT ALL YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW? WE'LL MAKE THE TRANSACTION,
I'll RUB MY HAND THROUGH MY HAIR,

Where's SONNY? I DON'T KNOW.
what DO YOU MEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW? HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. I THINK THEY LET HIM GO.
why WOULD THEY LET HIM GO? BECAUSE HE WAS IN ON IT WITH THEM.
are YOU SURE?
these GUYS ARE PSYCHO. THEY HAD A GUN TO MY HEAD.
I'm SURE THAT THEY KILLED BUD.
and IF SONNY AIN'T DEAD OR BEATEN UP LIKE ME, THEN HE WAS IN ON IT, TOO. LISTEN, WE'RE GONNA GET YOU TO A HOSPITAL.

Yeah. YEAH. FOUND DEBBIE DYMAN.
Marty AND TOM ARE TAKING HER TO BELLEVUE.
she's PRETTY BANGED UP. WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU?
not MUCH. SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HER BOYFRIEND'S MURDER.
all SHE WAS TRYING TO DO WAS UNLOAD THE DRUGS. WHERE'S SONNY?
she DIDN'T KNOW. SHE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HANK?
Yeah. HE WAS BARKING A LOT, AND THEN THE OTHER GUY WHO ROLLED UP ON YOU IN THE FACTORY TOOK HIM OUTSIDE, AND THEN THAT WAS THE LAST SHE SAW OF HIM.
this OTHER GUY'S JOHNNY'S RUNNING BUDDY? YEAH, LUIS, AND HE'S IN THE WIND.
and WE LIKE THEM FOR THE MURDER? YEAH.
Oh, NICE OF YOU TO JOIN US. WHERE THE HELL YOU BEEN?
I SPENT THE LAST SIX HOURS IN A DUMPSTER.
it WAS A NIGHTMARE.
somebody WANT TO FILL ME IN?
Hey.
come HERE.
Hey, DUNBAR, GOOD THING YOU'RE BLIND.
the OLD DUNBAR WOULD'VE PULLED HIS GUN OUT ON THOSE CLOWNS.
it WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE THE O. K. CORRAL IN THERE. SHUT UP.
give US A MINUTE. DID YOU FIND THE COKE?
Hey!
Hey!
what THE HELL DID YOU GET ME INTO, HUH? I KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW, DUNBAR.
Yeah, I KNOW I GOT SET UP. NOT BY ME, YOU DIDN'T!
where YOU BEEN?
they DROVE US BACK TO THE CITY, OKAY,
to THE EAST VILLAGE, AND THEN THEY KEPT ASKING DEBBIE, "WHERE'S THE COKE? WHERE'S THE COKE? WHERE'S THE COKE?"
she DON'T KNOW. SO WE ROLLED UP ON THEIR SPOT.
I BUSTED OUT OF THERE LIKE RICOCHET RABBIT, YOU KNOW?
they WERE SHOOTING AT ME. I TURN THE CORNER.
I JUMP INTO A DUMPSTER AND HIDE OUT THERE TILL I DON'T HEAR THEIR VOICES NO MORE. FOR SIX HOURS?
smell ME!
why DIDN'T YOU CALL?
they TOOK MY PHONE.
they TOOK MY WALLET. THEY--THEY ROBBED ME.
and THOSE TWO GUYS
they JUST HAPPENED TO BE THERE WHEN WE DROVE UP?
okay. THIS IS WHAT I PIECED TOGETHER, OKAY?
when BUD PUT OUT ON THE STREET ABOUT ALL OF THIS STUFF HE HAD TO UNLOAD, HE STARTED BLABBING TO ANYONE
who WOULD LISTEN, AND IT FINALLY GOT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL OWNERS, THE PUERTO RICANS.
they MUST'VE KILLED BUD. THEN THEY FOLLOWED US OUT THERE.
as FAR AS WHO'S GOT THE COKE, I DON'T KNOW. IT WASN'T YOU?
Oh, MY GOD.
it's COME TO THIS NOW, HUH?
you ACCUSING ME OF DOUBLE-DEALING?
the FIRST THING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU WALKED INTO THIS ROOM WAS, "DID WE FIND THE KE?
it WASN'T, "WHERE'S DEBB?" WHO KILLED YOUR COUSIN, NOTHING ABOUT MY DOG.
no, THE ONLY THING YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT WAS THE COKE.
have I BEEN WONDERING WHAT MY FINDER'S FEE MIGHT BE?
Yes. IS THAT SHOCKING TO YOU?
what HAPPENED TO MY DOG?
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS IN A DUMPSTER!
I HEARD BARKING, AND THEN I DIDN'T...
I DIDN'T HEAR THE BARKING NO MORE.
so I DON'T KNOW. IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HIM
you KNOW WHAT? WITH ALL RESPECT TO YOUR DOG, DUNBAR, YOU KNOW, I ALMOST GOT KILLED.
okay? .
a HUMAN BEING.
get OUT OF HERE.
we GOTTA BRING CHIEF TUNNEY UP TO SPEED.
well, CHIEF, THE GUY WHO USED TO RENT THE APARTMENT THE D.O.A. LIVES IN, HE STASHED 5 KILOS OF COKE IN HIS COUCH.
he GETS KILLED. HE NEVER TELLS ANYBODY WHERE THE COKE IS.
and THE COKE, WE FOUND OUT, BELONGED TO THESE TWO DUDES JOHNNY AND LUIS.
Johnny WE ALREADY HAVE IN CUSTODY,
and LUIS--WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GET OUR HANDS ON HIM.
we LIKE THEM FOR THE MURDER? YEAH. YOU KNOW, WE THINK THEY PROBABLY GOT IN THERE, GOT THE INFORMATION FROM THE D.O.A.
but WHEN THEY WENT TO THE STASH SPOT IN JERSEY, IT WAS ALREADY GONE. WHERE DID THE COKE END UP?
the D.O.A. DIDN'T HAVE A HISTORY OF SELLING DRUGS,
so WHEN HE CAME ACROSS ALL THIS COKE, HE WAS IN WAY OVER HIS HEAD. I GET THAT. WHERE DID THE COKE END UP?
one OUT OF THE FIVE PEOPLE THAT HE PUT FEELERS OUT TO
to SEE IF THEY COULD SELL IT-- A RORY GLANN--HE RIPPED 'EM OFF.
he's AT CENTRAL BOOKING FOR POSSESSION.
how DID YOU END UP LOST OUT IN NEW JERSEY, DETECTIVE DUNBAR?
my INFORMANT HOOKED ME UP WITH THE D.O.A.'s GIRLFRIEND.
she SAID THE COCAINE WAS OUT IN JERSEY.
we GOT OUT THERE. TWO GUYS SHOW UP.
situation GOT BAD.
I DIDN'T BLOW MY COVER.
they TOOK THE OTHER TWO AND LEFT.
all RIGHT.
keep ME POSTED.
Thanks, CHIEF.
they JUST LEFT ME THERE.
Oh, MAN, I'M TELLING YOU, WE GOT BOXED IN. NO.
wait. WHY DID THEY LEAVE ME THERE?
why DIDN'T THEY KILL US?
because THEY WANTED THE COKE.
so WHY DID THEY KILL BUD KESSEL, THE ONE GUY WHO KNEW WHERE THE COKE WAS?
because THEY DIDN'T.
right.
what WERE THE WOUNDS ON THE D.O.A?
beat ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH A BASEBALL BAT
and LEFT FACE-DOWN. THAT'S NOT THESE TWO GUYS.
well, HE GOT HIT WITH A BAT BY SOMEONE.
what ABOUT THIS RORY GUY WHO SOLD THE COKE? ALIBIED OUT.
we EVER GET ANY PRINTS OFF THE BAT? NOPE.
girlfriend. DEBBIE.
she STILL AT BELLEVUE? YEAH.
great. I'LL GO TALK TO HER.
let YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND.
Hey, UH, YOU WANT TO TAKE A RIDE DOWN TO THE EAST VILLAGE TO LOOK FOR THE DOG?
you GOT THE TIME?
Yeah.
sure.
Thanks.
what HAPPENED AT THE APARTMENT THIS MORNING WITH BUD?
what WENT WRONG?
I DON'T KNOW.
I WASN'T THERE.
I'm GONNA TELL YOU,
just SO YOU KNOW,
that NO ONE IS LOOKING AT YOU LIKE A CRIMINAL.
not AS LONG AS YOU KEEP TELLING US THE TRUTH.
now WE KNOW IT WAS YOU.
just TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.
he JUST...
he KEPT DOING SO MUCH OF THE STUFF THAT HE JUST--HE STARTED TO GET ALL PARANOID.
he STARTED TO THINK THAT I WAS AGAINST HIM.
and THEN HE KEPT SAYING THAT IT WAS HIS COKE
because WE FOUND IT IN HIS COUCH IN HIS APARTMENT.
then HE CUT ME OUT OF THE DEAL.
and YOU WERE HIGH, RIGHT?
I WAS AWAKE FOR TWO DAYS.
he HAD THIS...
he HAD THIS BAT BY HIS DOOR THAT HE KEPT FOR PROTECTION.
and...
okay.
Hey.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE? I THOUGHT YOU HAD A DINNER.
I CANCELLED RIGHT AFTER YOU CALLED.
we DIDN'T FIND HIM, OBVIOUSLY.
I'm SURE HE'LL TURN UP.
Yeah.
what ARE YOU GONNA DO IN THE MEANTIME?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I DON'T EVEN THINK I CAN DO MY JOB WITHOUT HANK.
what HAPPENED WITH YOU THIS MORNING?
we DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT NOW.
no, NO, LET'S DO.
I WANT TO. I WANT TO HEAR IT. TELL ME.
what DO YOU THINK HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
I REMEMBER I ASKED YOU TO CANCEL YOUR DINNER, AND
Yeah, BUT DID YOU CONSIDER FOR A SECOND
that DINNER MIGHT BE IMPORTANT TO ME?
I THOUGHT IT'D BE NICE TO SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER, YOU KNOW, TALK.
I've BEEN AFTER YOU FOR THAT BOSTON WEEKEND FOR SIX WEEKS.
you COULDN'T FIND THE TIME TO GIVE ME A SIMPLE YES OR NO ANSWER.
but TODAY YOU WANT TO TALK,
and IT'S DROP EVERYTHING.
I DIDN'T SEE IT THAT WAY.
you KNOW, MAYBE IT TAKES EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT TO DO YOUR JOB, AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT FOR OUR MARRIAGE.
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO FIGHT YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION,
and I JUST C'T DO IT ANYMORE.
maybe WE SHOULD TALK TO SOMEONE.
what DO YOU MEAN, LIKE A THERAPIST?
Yeah.
if IT WAS OKAY WITH YOU, MAYBE DR. GALLOWAY.
if YOU'RE INTERESTED, I COULD CALL HIM.
I'd LIKE THAT.
okay.
we're GONNA FIND HANK.
Hello?
yes?
Hank! HEY!

Hey.

you EVER NEED A FAVOR, YOU GIVE ME A CALL.
thank YOU.
thank YOU.
sure.
have A GOOD NIGHT.
Yeah. I JUST...
step UP.
look at that lady's shoes!
thanks for letting me skip school, mom.
you're just the best.
Yeah, well, it is quite a show, and the show hasn't even started yet.
Where's aunt linda? -- I don't know.
can't we go inside? I'm dying to see cousin Sofie.
I can't believe she's opening fashion week.
God, the traffic.
and the parking rates are outrageous. You know they hiked them up for all this.
well, look who's bringing sexy back.
Oh, stop it.
it looks beautiful. -- Mom's not kidding.
you look fierce.
Ah, so do you. Let's go.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait.
there's a tag. Let me just... -- Oh, no, no. Don't touch it.
I'm returning it tomorrow.
I know. I know. I'm a horrible person.
I already said a preemptive novena.
this smells like a wendy thing.
you know me and my sister.
you graduated at the top of your class.
you spent ten years on the floor at kings general, and you are a World-Class mom.
you're sweet.
all she sees is that I still bear the scarlet letter of new york city.
the dreaded 718 Staten Island area code.
I think it's cool.
I do, too. -- Speaking of which...
Hi!
Hi.
look at you!
is this Bianco Alessi, Linda?
that must have set Daniel back some change.
look at you. If I had those cheekbones.
how's the commissioner?
good. Thank you.
what a scare, huh?
don't tell me that's Nicky.
you have blossomed overnight. -- It's been two years.
I heard that.
I am so excited you guys are here.
this is the day we've been working for since Sofie started modeling.
backstage is a madhouse. We can't all go.
you guys find your seats.
you are coming with me.
okay.
Oh, god, Harry.
my stomach is doing flip-flops.
breathe deep, sweetheart. You're gonna blow their socks off.
Oh, my god! Auntie Linda!
Hi! - Hi!
down girl. I'm curling. This thing's hot.
Harry, this is my aunt Linda. This is my friend Harry.
how are the butterflies, sweetie?
it's my first big show, mom. Awful.
Uh-oh. Incoming. -- Here's our little catalog girl.
big day for you, sweetie.
just be careful you don't fall down out there.
you're still here, Cameron?
what happened to my mineral water?
Ex-supermodel with a TV show.
I guess page six wasn't lying about Milli Skye.
I mean, talk about toxic.
she was just trying to jinx you, Sofie, and it won't work if you don't let it.
I just can't wait for this to start.
we are so proud of you, Sof.
why don't you go on in, Linda, and let her focus?
okay.
this is exactly what I don't want to see when I open the paper.
some pedestrian's photo of one of my officers behind the wheel of his RMP texting.
no, I don't want to see the officer.
I want his boss to come to the 14th floor forthwith.
my day, we used to have to pull them out of bars.
I worked the breakfast line at comforting community this morning in the church's basement.
one of our parishioners gave me some unsettling news.
this is turkey, right? -- Yeah.
it's dark meat? -- I said it was for you.
I don't even want to talk about it out loud because it might make it come true.
she heard that father Mcmurray is leaving.
has he got some kind of health issue?
Nah.
Lucy's pretty plugged in to St. Luke's.
she said they're transferring him to Bolivia.
well, that doesn't make any sense.
it's a little late in the day for that kind of change.
I don't want to even think about St. Luke's without him.
he's meant so much to the family.
buried my betty.
Mary and Joe, too.
I thought he was going to bury me.
Oh, aunt Wendy, this is beyond incredible.
Erin, you...
Oh, please.
there she is.
Oh... my... god. -- She's stunning.
Oh, my god. Sofie!
Sofie, wake up. -- Call 911.
is there a doctor?!
I know CPR. -- What's happening?
what's going on?
she has a pulse. She's just unresponsive.
stay with her.
Oh my god, Milli. -- Somebody do something.
can you hear me? - She just collapsed.
I don't know what happened.
she wasn't feeling good. I pushed her.
you couldn't have stopped her from going out there, Wendy.
people think these models starve themselves or go on drugs, but not Sofie.
and Milli's dead? That cannot be a coincidence.
Oh, god, Mrs. Lightner.
I came as soon as I heard. How is she? What happened?
we don't know. She's in a coma.
is she going to be all right?
well, they're stabilizing her until they can figure out what happened.
um, this is atlanta.
she's been a big sister to sofie since the beginning.
atlanta, this is my sister-in-law, My niece, my little sister...
Mrs. Lightner, can I talk to you for a moment?
it's fine. They're family.
we just got back the tox screen of the contents of your daughter's stomach.
I'm afraid they found a foreign substance believed to be a poisonous mushroom called amanita phalloides.
a mushroom?
the death cap.
it's one of the most poisonous mushrooms in the world.
science class.
someone poisoned Sofie?
well, we don't know how she came to ingest the mushroom, But the good news is, now we know that, we can focus on restoring her liver function.
who would do such a thing?
well, that's what the police are going to have to find out.
bless me father, for I have sinned.
I has been two weeks since my last confession.
these are my sins.
I lost my temper at Sunday dinner, and swore in front of my grandchildren.
I was angry at my son.
Danny? -- Exactly.
what did you say?
the big one.
I see.
the temper, Frank-- We've talked about that.
I know that, father.
all right, say two our fathers, five hail marys and a good act of contrition.
thank you, father.
so, it took you two weeks to stir up one sin?
I heard you're leaving St. Luke's.
so much for keeping the transfer quiet.
is this something you really want?
I've had a good run at St. Luke's, Frank.
bolivia will be an invigorating new challenge.
father...
is there anything I can say that will change your mind?
I'm a parish priest, Frank.
I go where I'm asked.
these mushrooms that poisoned your friend usually take 12 to 20 hours to have this kind of effect, so it's important that we track the whereabouts of milli and sofie during that time period.
and Sofie's mother told us that Sofie was at some party last night at Milli Skye's loft.
we all were.
it was her annual kick off party for fashion week.
okay, was there anyone at that party that you know of would want to hurt your friend?
Sofie? Absolutely not.
she's the sweetest girl in the world.
besides, she hasn't even been in this business long enough to make any enemies.
okay, what about Milli? Is there anyone who would want to hurt her?
everybody. -- Everybody?
Atlanta! Oh, my god. -- Harry.
what's going on? Where is she? -- Sofie's on a respirator and dialysis.
it's horrible. And she's got swelling on her brain.
does dorian know?
who's Dorian?
it's sofie's new boyfriend.
and who is this?
Oh, this is Harry.
he's my best friend, and Sofie's hairdresser.
Hi.
these are the Detectives. They were just wondering if there was anybody at the party last night who would want to see Milli dead.
everybody.
okay.
Yeah, Reagan, I don't know.
I don't know anything about, you know, fashion models and-and poisonous mushrooms.
I don't, either, but I'm doing it for my wife, for her sister.
Oh, the sister I don't hear anything nice about.
and you never will hear anything good about her,
but unfortunately, her daughter's in a coma, 'Cause someone tried to kill her, and they did kill Milli.
all right, okay.
thank you for seeing me, father.
I called you father.
old habits die hard, your excellency.
well, it's never too soon to start talking about security for the pope's visit next year.
what are you really doing here, Francis?
you always could see through me.
well, it goes with the miter.
well...
I'm not here as the police commissioner. I'm here as a parishioner.
you want to know why I'm transferring father Mcmurray out.
I do.
the Reagan family has a strong bond with the father.
these are hard times for the church, Francis.
I've had to close six schools in our diocese, even our own St. Brendan's.
a sad day. I got a good education there, so did my children.
have you spoken with father Mcmurray?
I have.
he said nothing that would indicate he had a problem with the move.
Well...?
well,
I'm a cop, your excellency.
it's really more about what he didn't say.
something's wrong.
a woman has accused father Mcmurray of inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature.
does she have any proof?
in the current climate, proof is not necessary.
Francis, you came to me a while back and reminded me that the church can no longer afford to sweep things under the rug.
the woman is demanding he be removed from st. Luke's.
we're facing the issue head-on.
this man buried my wife and my son.
he baptized Jamie. Father Mcmurray is a good man.
what this woman is saying is not possible.
it is just as important to exonerate an innocent person as it is to convict a guilty one.
that's what they teach us at the academy from day one.
I know you share this belief.
father...
in so many ways, I will always be the student, and you the mentor, so this is not easy for me to say, but you are not facing this problem head-on.
this is just another way of sweeping things under the rug.
to ignore this woman's accusation would bring tremendous negative attention, which the church can ill afford.
father Mcmurray leaves at the end of the month.
okay. Yes. Whatever.
what's up, Jack?
um, the mushroom samples have been sent to the dea lab in D.C.
it seems that they can figure out exactly what country these death caps came from.
great. When we found out where, we'll take a look, see who went there and when. What else?
Yeah. Well, our lab is going over everything they found backstage at the fashion show.
well, timeline-wise, Milli's party is the best bet.
well, that's good news and bad news.
bad news first.
well, the bad news is, the loft was completely cleaned out, and the caterers got rid of all the old food.
anybody getting the caterer's story?
Yeah, as we speak. -- All right, how about the good news?
good news is, while you were downstairs, this came from milli Skye's network.
it seems that she had a camera crew recording All six plus hours of the party for milli's reality show.
that is every minute of her every move.
well, maybe we'll get lucky, catch a killer in the act.
worst case, we get to see how the beautiful people party.
there's a young lady here to see you about the Milli Skye case.
are you Detective Reagan?
Yeah. This is my partner Detective Curatola.
you are? -- Cameron swanson.
I was Milli Skye's personal assistant.
mind taking off your sunglasses?
Mm-hmm.
I knew you'd catch me anyways.
kill Milli? Me?
I stole from her, that is all, and I didn't really steal from her because that money was mine.
let's say you were stealing and that's all.
why don't you take us back to the beginning of you and Milli?
that morning-- The morning of the party, they didn't have any lactose-free for her latte, so I used soy milk, and she start screaming at me.
I told her I was quitting, and I wanted my money, but she didn't give it to me, So I tried to leave, and she said I couldn't because she needed me for the party, and when I tried to go, she took her cell phone and smashed it into my face.
the black eye.
I just wanted my $1, 200.
I knew she'd be distracted during the party, so I snuck in.
I knew where she kept the cash.
I have it here, and I can give it back.
no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
if you quit, then why were you with Milli the next day at the fashion show?
she said she'd tell my parents I'm bulimic.
all right.
suppose we believe you.
suppose you're telling the truth.
is there anything you saw at the party that would help us find out who killed Milli?
anything you know, anybody acting suspicious?
tampering with the food in the kitchen? Anything?
well, sofie's new boyfriend, Dorian...
baby rock star Dorian? What does he have to do with it?
I saw him... saw him shaving something onto Sofie's risotto.
Sofie's risotto?
not Milli's?
I don't know. I told you I was only there for a second.
I didn't see much, but I saw that.
sit tight for a second.
I don't know.
maybe we have been looking at the wrong vic.
I mean, maybe Sofie was the target, Milli was collateral.
who would want to kill Sofie and why?
I don't know. I mean, boyfriend's as good a place as any to start.
what about her?
well, Milli's not exactly around to press charges.
knowing my track record with a certain someone at the D.A.'s office, they probably cut her loose anyway. -- Yeah.
Hey.
look at this guy.
we got a sector to patrol, and you're playing facebook?
no. It's just, uh...
everything all right?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
so go, uh, inventory your RMP. I'll meet you in the lot.
you got it, sarge. -- All right.
Hello, Frank.
didn't mean to disturb you, father.
Oh, not at all.
back for another run at the booth so soon?
I need to talk to you.
please sit.
I went to see bishop Donovan.
the woman was a member of the parish years ago.
she didn't have an easy life.
she imagined she was in love with me.
we're taught to expect this as priests.
there were letters and gifts. And she finally made a physical advance, which I, of course, gently deflected.
and I thought that was the end of it.
and it was.
but after a failed marriage, she moved back into her parents' house and to the parish.
I think she feels shame in herself at the sight of me.
have you told this to bishop Donovan?
the bishop is between a rock and a hard place.
the woman is imbalanced, Frank.
she has a history of psychiatric illness.
but if we defend ourselves by revealing this, It will only bring up the church's recent history of having turned a blind eye to legitimate claims of abuse.
this isn't right.
and you falling on your sword isn't the answer.
Oh, I'm not a martyr.
the church has plenty of real ones.
I'm at peace, Frank.
I wish the reagan family could say the same.
eh, it's like a nest of vipers, bunch of phonies.
it's amazing. They all hated Milli Skye, yet they're all at her party.
typical.
there's Milli.
okay, this is Sofie right here. That's my niece.
she's a pre tty girl.
what's that?
that's her boyfriend, Dorian.
he's a guy? -- Yeah, that's a guy.
he's a musician.
he's a big, famous dude.
famous with who?
with kids. You know, young girls.
he's this new wave, new punk.
and you know this because?
stupid magazines at the hair salon.
hold on. Pause that.
what is he doing there?
the girl with the black eye, she said he put something on top of sofie's food.
well, he's doing it right there.
right. What is that?
it's like a mushroom or something.
it's not parmesan cheese, I'll tell you that much.
look. Look. Look at the frame in the back.
it's Milli's assistant with the dark glasses.
well, she said she saw him put it on there, so...
all right, let's keep watching.
Nope.
look at this. Milli didn't even get any of that stuff.
no.
keep watching.
look at that. Milli took Sofie's plate.
there. Milli got some. Just maybe wasn't by design.
Yeah, looks like she got a lot more than she bargained for.
Yeah, like being dead.
let's go snatch up this dorian kid. -- Yep.
mind if we crash the party?
cops! -- Shut up!
everybody, put your hands where we can see them.
kill that music right now!
we're looking for Dorian.
what's his last name? -- Dorian.
the rock star.
step aside.
get over there.
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.
what are you doing with this, huh?
what are you doing? Come on.
come on, rock star. Come on.
look what i found. -- Mushrooms.
everybody in here is gonna cry.
everybody in here's gonna fry, fry.
I'm starting with the beauties 'cause they're so bleeping snooty.
look at all the models. Watch them die, die.
and now a model's dead.
it's just a song.
a song about killing models.
how convenient would it be if your girlfriend, a model, happened to die right when your new video was being released?
that would be number one with a bullet.
you think this is some kind of joke?
less than 48 hours after your girlfriend slipped into a coma and some woman died because somebody gave them some kind of poisonous mushroom, you're having a drug-Fueled party and flushing what appears to be the murder weapon right down the toilet.
I told you, they're psychedelic mushrooms.
well, I got a video of you shaving something that sure does look like a mushroom onto sofie's risotto at Milli's party.
what are you talk...
Oh yeah, you mean my truffle?
what?
I'm talking about a poisonous mushroom.
no, man, it's a truffle I bought at mario's charity auction to feed the needy. It gives me good cred.
that thing set me back two grand.
a chocolate truffle? -- No, no, man.
not chocolate. It's like a... it's, like, mushroom, but not a poisonous mushroom.
like a... like a tuber, I think.
Yeah. They're rare or something.
anyway, I didn't give any to Milli, and she's the one that's dead.
okay. Why don't you tell me what you did with the rest of this magical $2, 000 truffle?
it's gone. I gave it to a lot of other people at the party.
you got to ask yourself why they're not dead, too, right?
no, I don't have to ask myself anything.
but what I do keep wondering about is why you haven't asked any questions about your girlfriend.
I mean, she's in a coma.
you haven't even asked how she's doing.
I know. I-I'm sorry.
I-I forgot. -- Right.
your girlfriend's dying. It just slipped your mind.
Yeah. Well, see, that's the thing.
what's the thing?
she's not really my girlfriend.
she's not your girlfriend?
no. It was like an arrangement.
it was my manager and her mother.
Wendy thought it would be a good idea for Sofie's rising star, The red carpet And page six and like that.
Mm-hmm?
so this arrangement?
what did you get from it?
I'd rather not say.
Really? Okay.
well, you don't say.
I'll just charge you with homicide and get on with my day.
protection.
from what?
protection from what?
from rumors.
what type of rumors?
the kind that if a young teenage girl were to hear, She would never buy another dorian ticket.
Hmm...
look, the truth is that I was a lot more interested in her friend harry than I was in Sofie.
Reagan? Talk to you? -- Yeah.
I just discovered that Sofie was Dorian's beard.
Really? Huh. -- Yeah.
Wow.
well, one thing the guy's telling the truth about?
the lab results just came in on those mushrooms he was trying to flush down the toilet bowl.
they're psychedelic.
I guess the truffles weren't poisonous either, then.
I don't know. This is very confusing.
well, what we do know is that somebody tried to poison someone.
one woman is dead, and a girl is in a coma.
let's just hold him for possession of a controlled substance till we figure this thing out.
Yeah.
morning.
Hey.
any change?
she's breathing on her own.
the liver chemistry's better.
they don't think it was the musician anymore.
the mushrooms that they confiscated were a recreational drug.
dorian had no reason to harm Sofie.
they barely knew each other.
I know.
Daniel told you.
about the arrangement?
you must think i'm horrible.
it's, um...
it's just hard for me to understand.
what?
why I pushed my daughter to get mixed up in some creepy, fake relationship with a drug-addled rock star in the closet so she could get her name in the paper?
get her face on the cover of some stupid magazine?
you don't think I feel bad enough already?
I didn't say that. -- That's what you were thinking.
little miss staten island salt of the earth.
Wendy, please stop. -- You stop.
you blame me because I wanted a better life.
this is better?
there it is.
the contempt.
I was trying to be sympathetic, Wen.
is that so?
just leave me and my daughter alone.
Wen... -- Get out of here!
well, the woman has a history of mental problems.
so what's going on? Why are they kicking him out?
he's a sacrificial lamb.
I'm not following you, dad.
it'll look like they're latching on to this to excuse themselves for allegations that they've ignored in the past.
Oh. Well, thanks, Harvard.
you asked.
that isn't fair. -- No it isn't, nicky.
but it isn't simple, either.
if it goes public, it hurts the church.
no kidding.
I'm in the middle of a fund drive for comforting community.
if people get turned off, if they don't ante up, what's going to happen to all those senior citizens we serve?
so what do you think, dad?
I was kind of hoping to find out what you guys think.
it's a tough one.
I mean, I can see it from both sides. -- Yeah, me, too.
lawyers, what do you expect?
well, I'll take a side. It stinks.
I'm not talking about the legality.
it's not a question of due process, it's an ethical issue.
Yeah. Is the church making the father pay for its former sins?
Yeah. On the other hand, father mcmurray isn't resisting, right?
right.
of course not. He loves the church.
he's willing to make the sacrifice.
are we being selfish for not wanting to lose him?
are we putting our wishes before the needs of the church?
that's all well and good. But somebody should take a side.
he's a good priest. It stinks.
well, I think we should have faith that bishop donovan will do the right thing.
everything has a cost, even the truth.
but the reward for truth is a clear eye and a clear conscience.
who said that? -- Bishop donovan.
when he was at St. Brendan's.
I just hope he remembers it.
brought you some of Staten Island's finest, Jackie, and some fresh jet fuel.
thank you.
any results from the DEA in D.C. yet?
um, yeah. The mushrooms that killed Milli and poisoned Sofie, they came from Morocco.
and they were purchased fresh and harvested no more than a month ago.
you got any airplane manifests from morocco?
passenger lists for the last six weeks just to be safe from marrakech and casablanca.
this is from Aberia Airlines.
rock the Casbah.
uh, so far nothing on American.
but i'm checking air France now.
Newark to Marrakech, via Paris...
what was that-that hairstylist? What was it? Harry? Barry?
Harry. Harry Bell?
Harry Bell. Right here.
seat 30a, three weeks ago.
Harry, that sweet little hairdresser kid?
maybe. Why don't we go pay him a visit?
we'll check the rest of the manifests on the way.
okay.
I hear music.
Yeah, pretty loud. Maybe he's home.
open the door!
well, you know, the neighbors have been complaining about loud music.
right.
Hey, Dorian! A clean park.
new York City thanks you.
Oh, no, no, thank you.
I got 99 more hours of community service to do for something that grows in god's earth.
well, it may grow in god's earth, but it's still illegal.
the other day you told us you'd rather hang out with harry than you would with sofie, is that right?
Yeah. We had our moment. Why?
well, Harry the hairdresser's dead.
apparently, he committed suicide.
Harry's dead?
Yeah, that's what I said.
now, the problem for us is harry had just become our main suspect.
he was on a plane to morocco, where the mushrooms came from, but we don't have a motive or any reason why he would kill himself.
maybe you could shed some light on that for us.
Morocco? Yeah. That-that's actually where harry and I had our time.
but he didn't say anything about mushrooms.
you were in Morocco?
we didn't see your name on the airplane manifests.
Yeah, well, I don't fly commercial.
Oh. So you had a private jet?
Yeah. That's why I went to morocco.
Harry was working on a photo shoot for Atlanta's marrakesh spread.
Atlanta? Sofie's mentor?
atlanta was on a private plane to Morocco with you?
I gave her a lift.
like I said, perception is everything.
that would explain why she wasn't on the passenger list.
we're looking for Atlanta.
she just went upstairs for a smoke. Why? What do you want?
detective Reagan, my partner Detective Curatola.
you remember us from the hospital...?
don't come any closer!
listen, all right. --I'll jump!
all right -- I will!
nobody's going to jump.
just get out of here!
we can't leave you up there, okay?
we're not going to leave you unless we know you're safe.
so why don't you just relax and we'll talk about this, okay?
you have no idea what it's like for me.
I'm 25 and my life is over.
I've been working fashion week since I was 13.
I booked a dozen shows a year.
but this year?
one show. And I had to beg for it.
okay, you don't want to jump because of that. Okay?
and it's not fair!
I didn't mean to hurt anybody!
okay, you didn't mean it.
I just thought it would make sofie sick, and that-that I would get to close the lara fortunato show.
I put it in her risotto when she wasn't looking.
but I don't know what happened to Milli. And now...
Harry, and that's my fault, too?
look, it's not your fault. Harry killed himself, okay?
I killed him.
we were in this bazaar in marrakesh.
the shopkeeper had these mushrooms, and Harry didn't see me buy them, but he suspected me...
okay.
I told him that if he ratted me out that I would say that we did this together.
he's dead because of me.
no, he's dead because he killed himself, all right?
it was an accident; it's not your fault.
so why don't you just get down from there, okay?
come on down, all right?
come on. Don't do this to yourself.
just take my hand. Come on down.
come on down.
there you go. Come on.
come on down.
there you go.
all right.
Yeah, you just stand right there.
atlanta aka Lisa Jennings, you are under arrest for the murder of Milli Skye, attempted murder of sofie lightner.
let's go. Please. -- Let's go.
I'm sorry.
I was awful to you yesterday.
well, if it was one of my boys, I don't know what that would do to me.
Oh, don't be nice, Linda. I can't stand it.
had a lot of time to think about things.
making some changes...
if Sofie comes out of this.
well, don't even think about moving back to Staten Island.
you'd go nuts.
just saying.
she was surrounded by some desperate people, and I should have known.
I just wanted it for her so bad.
I closed my eyes to the truth.
you were doing what you thought was best.
every mother is guilty of that.
you would have known.
you would've seen right through them all.
I've always envied that about you.
you've envied me. Right.
Oh, I mean it.
you have always known exactly who you are.
you have never once pretended to be something you're not, not for anybody.
me?
I have spent my whole life trying to forget where i came from, trying to be something I'm not.
look where it got me.
well, I'm guilty of that, too.
I doubt it.
that wasn't my dress the other day.
what?
I bought it that morning kept the tags in it.
I was going to return it the next day.
Linda. -- I know. It was stupid and It was terrible but I just wanted to impress you.
you're a really sweet sister,you know that?
it was Staten Island.
mom?
Hey.
hi... baby.
mommy's right here.
thank you for seeing me, Francis.
please sit down, your excellency.
I made you some tea.
I see. Thank you.
I won't stay long.
I'm on my way to deliver a benediction at the UN.
they need it.
I always knew you had great things in store for you, Francis.
thank you.
and now look at you here in the catbird seat.
hot seat, sometimes.
tell me about it.
Oh, Francis.
we have such fine schools.
95% of our students go on to college.
they outperform every state and city test you can throw at them.
and to lose more schools...
I have thought about this problem long and hard.
Francis, when we last spoke, you reminded me of something.
what was that, your excellency?
the truth.
was I sacrificing truth for expedience in shipping the problem to south america? And the answer was "yes."
but now we're going to face this problem head-on.
how'd the board meeting go?
there's enough in the coffers for comforting community to fight for another year.
that's great, pop.
what's better, Francis, is that bishop Donovan changed his mind.
father Mcmurray doesn't have to go to bolivia after all.
always nice to hear good news.
this is so cool.
right and left.
look at that lady's shoes!
thanks for letting me skip school, Mom. You're just the best.
Yeah, well, it is quite a show, and the show hasn't even started yet.
Where's Aunt Linda? - I don't know.
can't we go inside? I'm dying to see Cousin Sofie.
I can't believe she's opening fashion week.
God, the traffic. And the parking rates are outrageous.
you know they hiked them up for all this. - Well, look who's bringing sexy back.
Oh, stop it. - It looks beautiful.
mom's not kidding.
you look fierce. - Ah, so do you. Let's go.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait. There's a tag. Let me just...
Oh, no, no. Don't touch it. I'm returning it tomorrow.
I know. I know. I'm a horrible person.
I already said a preemptive novena. - This smells like a Wendy thing.
you know me and my sister.
you graduated at the top of your class.
you spent ten years on the floor at Kings General, and you are a world-class mom.
you're sweet.
all she sees is that I still bear the Scarlet Letter of New York City
the dreaded 718
I think it's cool. - I do, too.
speaking of which...
look at you!
is this Bianco Alessi, Linda?
that must have set Daniel back some change.
look at you. If I had those cheekbones.
how's the Commissioner? - Good. Thank you.
what a scare, huh?
don't tell me that's Nicky.
I am so excited you guys are here.
this is the day we've been working for since Sofie started modeling.
backstage is a madhouse.
we can't all go. You guys find your seats.
you are coming with me.
okay.
Oh, God, Harry. My stomach is doing flip-flops.
breathe deep, sweetheart. You're gonna blow their socks off.
Oh, my God! Auntie Linda!
down girl. I'm curling. This thing's hot. - Harry, this is my Aunt Linda.
this is my friend Harry. - How are the butterflies, sweetie?
it's my first big show, Mom. Awful.
Uh-oh. Incoming. - Here's our little catalog girl.
big day for you, sweetie.
just be careful you don't fall down out there.
you're still here, Cameron?
what happened to my mineral water?
Ex-supermodel with a TV show.
I guess Page Six wasn't lying about Milli Skye.
I mean, talk about toxic.
she was just trying to jinx you, Sofie, and it won't work if you don't let it.
I just can't wait for this to start.
we are so proud of you, Sof.
why don't you go on in, Linda, and let her focus?
okay.
this is exactly what I don't want to see when I open the paper.
some pedestrian's photo of one of my officers behind the wheel of his RMP... texting.
no, I don't want to see the officer.
I want his boss to come to the 14th floor forthwith.
my day, we used to have to pull them out of bars.
I worked the breakfast line at Comforting Community this morning in the church's basement.
one of our parishioners gave me some unsettling news.
this is turkey, right? - Yeah.
it's dark meat? -I said it was for you.
I don't even want to talk about it out loud because it might make it come true.
she heard that Father McMurray is leaving.
has he got some kind of health issue? -Nah.
Lucy's pretty plugged in to St. Luke's.
she said they're transferring him to Bolivia.
well, that doesn't make any sense.
it's a little late in the day for that kind of change.
I don't want to even think about St. Luke's without him.
he's meant so much to the family.
buried my Betty. - Mary and Joe, too.
I thought he was going to bury me.
Oh, Aunt Wendy, this is beyond incredible.
Erin, you...
Oh, please.
there she is.
Oh... my... God. - She's stunning.
Oh, my God. Sofie!
Sofie. Sofie, wake up.
call 911. Is there a doctor?!
I know CPR. -What's happening?
what's going on? - She has a pulse.
she's just unresponsive. - Milli!
stay with her.
Oh my God, Milli. Somebody do something. - Can you hear me?
she just collapsed.
Oh, my God. She's dead.
I don't know what happened.
she wasn't feeling good. I pushed her.
you couldn't have stopped her from going out there, Wendy.
people think these models starve themselves or go on drugs, but not Sofie.
and Milli's dead? That cannot be a coincidence.
Oh, God, Mrs. Lightner.
I came as soon as I heard.
how is she? What happened?
we don't know. She's in a coma.
is she going to be all right?
well, they're stabilizing her until they can figure out what happened.
um, this is Atlanta.
she's been a big sister to Sofie since the beginning. Atlanta, this is my sister-in-law, my niece, my little sister...
Mrs. Lightner, can I talk to you for a moment?
the death cap.
it's one of the most poisonous mushrooms in the world.
science class.
someone poisoned Sofie?
well, we don't know how she came to ingest the mushroom, but the good news is, now we know that, we can focus on restoring her liver function.
unfortunately, we're too late for the other woman who ingested a larger amount.
who would do such a thing?
well, that's what the police are going to have to find out.
bless me Father, for I have sinned.
I has been two weeks since my last confession.
these are my sins.
I lost my temper at Sunday dinner, and swore in front of my grandchildren.
I was angry at my son.
Danny? - Exactly.
what did you say?
the big one. - I see.
the temper, Frank-- we've talked about that.
I know that, Father.
all right, say two Our Fathers, five Hail Marys and a good Act of Contrition.
thank you, Father.
so, it took you two weeks to stir up one sin?
I heard you're leaving St. Luke's.
so much for keeping the transfer quiet.
is this something you really want?
I've had a good run at St. Luke's, Frank.
bolivia will be an invigorating new challenge.
father...
is there anything I can say that will change your mind?
I'm a parish priest, Frank.
I go where I'm asked.
these mushrooms that poisoned your friend
they usually take 12 to 20 hours to have this kind of effect, so it's important that we track the whereabouts of Milli and Sofie during that time period.
and Sofie's mother told us that Sofie was at some party last night at Milli Skye's loft.
we all were.
it was her annual kickoff party for Fashion Week.
okay, was there anyone at that party that you know of would want to hurt your friend?
Sofie? Absolutely not.
she's the sweetest girl in the world.
besides, she hasn't even been in this business long enough to make any enemies.
okay, what about Milli? Is there anyone who would want to hurt her?
everybody.
everybody? - Atlanta!
Oh, my God. - Harry.
what's going on? Where is she?
Sofie's on a respirator and dialysis. It's horrible.
and she's got swelling on her brain.
does Dorian know? -Who's Dorian?
it's Sofie's new boyfriend. - And who is this?
Oh, this is Harry. He's my best friend, and Sofie's hairdresser.-hi
these are the detectives. They were just wondering if there was anybody at the party last night who would want to see Milli dead.
everybody.
okay.
Yeah, Reagan, I don't know.
I don't know anything about, you know, fashion models and-and poisonous mushrooms.
I don't, either, but I'm doing it for my wife, for her sister.
Oh, the sister I don't hear anything nice about.
and you never will hear anything good about her, but unfortunately, her daughter's in a coma, 'cause someone tried to kill her, and they did kill Milli.
all right, okay.
thank you for seeing me, Father.
I called you Father.
old habits die hard, Your Excellency.
well, it's never too soon to start talking about security for the Pope's visit next year.
what are you really doing here, Francis?
you always could see through me. Well, it goes with the miter.
well...
I'm not here as the police commissioner.
I'm here as a parishioner.
you want to know why I'm transferring Father McMurray out.
I do.
the Reagan family has a strong bond with the Father.
these are hard times for the church, Francis.
I've had to close six schools in our diocese, - even our own St. Brendan's. -A sad day.
I got a good education there, so did my children.
have you spoken with Father McMurray?
I have. He said nothing that would indicate he had a problem with the move.
Well...?
well, I'm a cop, Your Excellency.
it's really more about what he didn't say.
something's wrong.
a woman has accused Father McMurray of inappropriate behavior... of a sexual nature.
does she have any proof?
in the current climate, proof is not necessary.
Francis, you came to me a while back and reminded me that the church can no longer afford to sweep things under the rug.
the woman is demanding he be removed from St. Luke's.
we're facing the issue head-on.
this man buried my wife and my son.
he baptized Jamie.
father McMurray is a good man.
what this woman is saying is not possible.
it is just as important to exonerate an innocent person as it is to convict a guilty one.
that's what they teach us at the Academy from day one.
I know you share this belief.
father...
in so many ways, I will always be the student, and you the mentor, so this is not easy for me to say, but you are not facing this problem head-on.
this is just another way of sweeping things under the rug.
to ignore this woman's accusation would bring tremendous negative attention, which the church can ill afford.
father McMurray leaves at the end of the month.
okay. Yes. Whatever.
what's up, Jack?
um, the mushroom samples have been sent to the DEA lab in D. C.
it seems that they can figure out exactly what country these death caps came from.
great. When we found out where, we'll take a look, see who went there and when. What else?
Yeah. Well, our lab is going over everything they found backstage at the fashion show.
well, Timeline-wise, Milli's party is the best bet.
well, that's good news and bad news. -Bad news first.
well, the bad news is, the loft was completely cleaned out, - and the caterers got rid of all the old food. - Anybody getting the caterer's story?
Yeah, as we speak. - All right, how about the good news?
good news is, while you were downstairs, this came from Milli Skye's network.
it seems that she had a camera crew recording all six plus hours of the party for Milli's reality show.
that is every minute of her every move.
well, maybe we'll get lucky, catch a killer in the act.
worst case, we get to see how the beautiful people party.
there's a young lady here to see you about the Milli Skye case.
are you Detective Reagan?
Yeah. This is my partner Detective Curatola.
you are? - Cameron Swanson.
I was Milli Skye's personal assistant. - Mind taking off your sunglasses?
I knew you'd catch me anyway.
I'm here to report a crime.
kill Milli? Me?
I stole from her, that is all, and
I didn't really steal from her because that money was mine.
let's say you were stealing and that's all.
why don't you take us back to the beginning of you and Milli?
that morning... the morning of the party, they didn't have any lactose-free for her latte, so I used soy milk, and she starts screaming at me.
I told her I was quitting, and I wanted my money, but she didn't give it to me, so I tried to leave, and she said I couldn't because she needed me for the party, and when I tried to go, she took her cell phone and smashed it into my face.
the black eye. I just wanted my $1, 200.
I knew she'd be distracted during the party, so I snuck in.
I knew where she kept the cash. I have it here, and I can give it back.
no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
if you quit, then why were you with Milli the next day at the fashion show?
she said she'd tell my parents I'm bulimic.
all right. Suppose we believe you.
suppose you're telling the truth.
is there anything you saw at the party that would help us find out who killed Milli?
anything you know, anybody acting suspicious?
tampering with the food in the kitchen? Anything?
well, Sofie's new boyfriend, Dorian...
baby rock star Dorian? What does he have to do with it?
I saw him... saw him shaving something onto Sofie's risotto.
Sofie's risotto?
not Milli's?
I don't know. I told you I was only there for a second.
I didn't see much, but I saw that.
sit tight for a second.
I don't know.
maybe we have been looking at the wrong vic.
I mean, maybe Sofie was the target, Milli was collateral.
who would want to kill Sofie and why?
I don't know. I mean, boyfriend's as good a place as any to start.
what about her?
well, Milli's not exactly around to press charges.
knowing my track record with a certain someone at the D. A.'s office, - they probably cut her loose anyway. - Yeah.
look at this guy.
we got a sector to patrol, and you're playing Facebook?
no. It's just, uh...
everything all right?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
so go, uh, inventory your RMP.
I'll meet you in the lot.
you got it, Sarge. -All right.
Hello, Frank.
didn't mean to disturb you, Father.
Oh, not at all. Back for another run at the booth so soon?
I need to talk to you.
please sit.
I went to see Bishop Donovan.
the woman was a member of the parish years ago.
she didn't have an easy life.
she imagined she was in love with me.
we're taught to expect this as priests.
there were letters and gifts.
and she finally made a physical advance, which I, of course, gently deflected.
and I thought that was the end of it.
and it was.
but after a failed marriage, she moved back into her parents' house and to the parish.
I think she feels shame in herself at the sight of me.
have you told this to Bishop Donovan?
the Bishop is between a rock and a hard place.
the woman is imbalanced, Frank.
she has a history of psychiatric illness.
but if we defend ourselves by revealing this, it will only bring up the church's recent history of having turned a blind eye to legitimate claims of abuse.
this isn't right.
and you falling on your sword isn't the answer.
Oh, I'm not a martyr.
the Church has plenty of real ones.
I'm at peace, Frank.
I wish the Reagan family could say the same.
eh, it's like a nest of vipers, bunch of phonies.
it's amazing. They all hated Milli Skye, yet they're all at her party.
typical. - There's Milli.
okay, this is Sofie right here. That's my niece.
she's a pretty girl.
what's that?
that's her boyfriend, Dorian.
he's a guy? - Yeah, that's a guy.
he's a musician. He's a big, famous dude.
famous with who? With kids. - You know, young girls.
he's this new wave, new punk.
and you know this because?
stupid magazines at the hair salon.
hold on. Pause that.
what is he doing there?
the girl with the black eye-- she said he put something on top of Sofie's food.
well, he's doing it right there. -Right. What is that?
it's like a mushroom or something. It's not Parmesan cheese, I'll tell you that much.
look. Look. Look at the frame in the back.
it's Milli's assistant with the dark glasses.
well, she said she saw him put it on there, so...
all right, let's keep watching.
Nope. Look at this.
Milli didn't even get any of that stuff.
no.
keep watching.
look, at that. Milli took Sofie's plate.
there. Milli got some. Just maybe wasn't by design.
Yeah, looks like she got a lot more than she bargained for.
Yeah, like being dead.
let's go snatch up this Dorian kid.
Yep.
mind if we crash the party?
cops! - Shut up!
everybody, put your hands where we can see them. Kill that music right now!
we're looking for Dorian.
what's his last name? - Dorian.
the rock star.
step aside.
get over there.
what are you doing with this, huh?
what are you doing? Come on.
come on, rock star. Come on.
look what I found. - Mushrooms.
Oh year "Everybody in here is gonna cry.
everybody in here's gonna fry, fry.
I'm starting with the beauties "'cause they're so bleeping snooty.
look at all the models. Watch them die, die.
and now a model's dead.
it's just a song.
a song about killing models.
how convenient would it be if your girlfriend, a model, happened to die right when your new video was being released?
that would be number one with a bullet.
you think this is some kind of joke?
less than 48 hours after your girlfriend slipped into a coma and some woman died because somebody gave them some kind of poisonous mushroom, you're having a drug-fueled party and flushing what appears to be the murder weapon right down the toilet.
I told you, they're psychedelic mushrooms.
well, I got a video of you shaving something that sure does look like a mushroom onto Sofie's risotto at Milli's party.
what are you talk... Oh yeah, you mean my truffle?
what? I'm talking about a poisonous mushroom.
no, man, it's a truffle I bought at Mario's charity auction to feed the needy. It gives me good cred.
that thing set me back two grand.
a chocolate truffle? - No, no, man.
not chocolate.
it's like a... it's, like, mushroom, but not a poisonous mushroom.
like a... Like a tuber, I think.
$2, 000?
Yeah. They're rare or something.
anyway, I didn't give any to Milli, and she's the one that's dead.
okay. Why don't you tell me what you did with the rest of this magical $2, 000 truffle?
it's gone.
I gave it to a lot of other people at the party.
you got to ask yourself why they're not dead, too, right?
no, I don't have to ask myself anything.
but what I do keep wondering about is why you haven't asked any questions about your girlfriend.
I mean, she's in a coma.
you haven't even asked how she's doing.
I know. I-I'm sorry.
I-I forgot.
right.
your girlfriend's dying. It just slipped your mind.
Yeah. Well, see, that's the thing.
what's the thing? -She's not really my girlfriend.
she's not your girlfriend? -No. It was like an arrangement.
it was my manager and her mother.
Wendy thought it would be a good idea for Sofie's rising star, the red carpet and Page Six and like that.
so this arrangement?
what did you get from it? - I'd rather not say.
Really? Okay.
well, you don't say.
I'll just charge you with homicide and get on with my day.
protection. - From what?
protection from what? -From rumors.
what type of rumors?
the kind that if a young teenage girl were to hear, she would never buy another Dorian ticket.
look, the truth is that I was a lot more interested in her friend Harry than I was in Sofie.
Reagan? Talk to you?
Yeah.
I just discovered that Sofie was Dorian's beard.
Really? Huh.- yeah
well, one thing the guy's telling the truth about?
the lab results just came in on those mushrooms he was trying to flush down the toilet bowl.
Mm-hmm? - They're psychedelic.
I guess the truffles weren't poisonous either, then.
I don't know. This is very confusing.
well, what we do know is that somebody tried to poison someone.
one woman is dead, and a girl is in a coma.
let's just hold him for possession of a controlled substance till we figure this thing out.
Yeah.
Morning.-hey
any change?
she's breathing on her own.
the liver chemistry's better.
they don't think it was the musician anymore.
the mushrooms that they confiscated were a recreational drug.
dorian had no reason to harm Sofie.
they barely knew each other.
I know.
Daniel told you about the arrangement?
you must think I'm horrible.
it's, um...
it's just hard for me to understand.
what?
why I pushed my daughter to get mixed up in some creepy, fake relationship with a drug-addled rock star in the closet so she could get her name in the paper?
get her face on the cover of some stupid magazine?
you don't think I feel bad enough already? - I didn't say that.
that's what you were thinking.
Wendy, please stop. - You stop!
you blame me because I wanted a better life.
this is better? - There it is.
the contempt. - I was trying to be sympathetic, Wen.
is that so?
just leave me and my daughter alone.
Wen... - Get out of here!
well, the woman has a history of mental problems.
so what's going on? Why are they kicking him out?
he's a sacrificial lamb. - I'm not following you, Dad.
you asked. -That isn't fair.
no it isn't, Nicky. But it isn't simple, either.
if it goes public, it hurts the Church.
no kidding.
I'm in the middle of a fund drive for Comforting Community.
if people get turned off, if they don't ante up, what's going to happen to all those senior citizens we serve?
so what do you think, Dad?
I was kind of hoping to find out what you guys think.
it's a tough one.
I mean, I can see it from both sides. - Yeah, me, too.
lawyers, what do you expect?
well, I'll take a side. It stinks.
I'm not talking about the legality.
it's not a question of due process, it's an ethical issue.
Yeah. Is the Church making the Father pay for its former sins?
Yeah. On the other hand, Father McMurray isn't resisting, right?
right.
of course not. He loves the Church. He's willing to make the sacrifice.
are we being selfish for not wanting to lose him?
are we putting our wishes before the needs of the Church?
that's all well and good. But somebody should take a side.
he's a good priest. - It stinks.
well, I think we should have faith that Bishop Donovan will do the right thing.
everything has a cost, even the truth.
but the reward for truth is a clear eye and a clear conscience.
who said that?
Bishop Donovan, when he was at St. Brendan's.
I just hope he remembers it.
Ooh. Thank you.
any results from the DEA in D. C. yet?
um, yeah. The mushrooms that killed Milli and poisoned Sofie, they came from Morocco.
and they were purchased fresh and harvested no more than a month ago.
you got any airplane manifests from Morocco?
passenger lists for the last six weeks just to be safe from Marrakech and Casablanca.
this is from Iberia Airlines.
rock the Casbah.
uh, so far nothing on American. But I'm checking Air France now.
Newark to Marrakech, via Paris...
what was that-that hairstylist? What was it? Harry? Barry?
Harry Bell. Right here.
seat 30A, three weeks ago.
Harry, that sweet little hairdresser kid?
maybe. Why don't we go pay him a visit?
we'll check the rest of the manifests on the way.
okay.
I hear music.
Yeah, pretty loud. - Maybe he's home.
open the door!
well, you know, the neighbors have been complaining about loud music.
right.
Hey, Dorian! A clean park.
new York City thanks you.
Oh, no, no, thank you.
I got 99 more hours of community service to do for something that grows in God's earth.
well, it may grow in God's earth, but it's still illegal.
the other day you told us you'd rather hang out with Harry than you would with Sofie, is that right?
Yeah. We had our moment. Why? -Well, Harry the hairdresser's dead.
apparently, he committed suicide.
Harry's dead?
Yeah, that's what I said. Now, the problem for us is Harry had just become our main suspect.
he was on a plane to Morocco, where the mushrooms came from, but we don't have a motive or any reason why he would kill himself.
maybe you could shed some light on that for us.
Morocco? Yeah.
that-that's actually where Harry and I had our time.
but he didn't say anything about mushrooms.
you were in Morocco? We didn't see your name on the airplane manifests.
Yeah, well, I don't fly commercial.
Oh. So you had a private jet? - Yeah. That's why I went to Morocco.
Harry was working on a photo shoot for Atlanta's Marrakesh spread.
Atlanta? Sofie's mentor?
atlanta was on a private plane to Morocco with you?
I gave her a lift.
like I said, perception is everything.
that would explain why she wasn't on the passenger list.
we're looking for Atlanta.
she just went upstairs for a smoke. Why? What do you want?
detective Reagan, my partner Detective Curatola.
you remember us from the hospital...?
don't come any closer! - Listen, all right...
I'll jump! I will! - All right, I'm stepping back.
nobody's going to jump. - Just get out of here!
we can't leave you up there, okay?
we're not going to leave you unless we know you're safe.
so why don't you just relax and we'll talk about this, okay?
you have no idea what it's like for me.
I'm 25 and my life is over.
I've been working Fashion Week since I was 13.
I booked a dozen shows a year. But this year?
one show. And I had to beg for it.
okay, you don't want to jump because of that. Okay?
and it's not fair!
I didn't mean to hurt anybody!
okay, you didn't mean it.
I just thought it would make Sofie sick, and that-that I would get to close the Lara Fortunato show.
I put it in her risotto when she wasn't looking.
but I don't know what happened to Milli. And now...
Harry, and that's my fault, too? - Look, it's not your fault.
Harry killed himself, okay? - I killed him.
we were in this bazaar in Marrakesh.
the shopkeeper had these mushrooms, and...
Harry didn't see me buy them, but he suspected me...
okay.
I told him that if he ratted me out...
that I would say that we did this together.
he's dead because of me.
no, he's dead because he killed himself, all right?
it was an accident; it's not your fault.
so why don't you just get down from there, okay?
come on down, all right? Come on. Don't do this to yourself.
just take my hand. Come on down.
come on down.
there you go. Come on. Come on down.
there you go. All right.
Yeah, you just stand right there.
atlanta aka Lisa Jennings, you are under arrest for the murder of Milli Skye, attempted murder of Sofie Lightner.
let's go. Please. - Let's go.
I'm sorry.
I was awful to you yesterday.
well, if it was one of my boys, I don't know what that would do to me.
Oh, don't be nice, Linda. I can't stand it.
had a lot of time to think about things.
making some changes...
if Sofie comes out of this.
you'd go nuts.
just saying.
she was surrounded by some desperate people, and I should have known.
I just wanted it for her so bad.
I closed my eyes to the truth.
you were doing what you thought was best. Every mother is guilty of that.
you would have known.
you would've seen right through them all.
I've always envied that about you.
you've envied me. Right.
Oh, I mean it.
you have always known exactly who you are.
you have never once pretended to be something you're not, not for anybody.
me? I have spent my whole life trying to forget where I came from, trying to be something I'm not.
look where it got me.
well, I'm guilty of that, too.
I doubt it.
that wasn't my dress the other day.
what?
I bought it that morning... kept the tags in it.
I was going to return it the next day.
Linda. I know. It was stupid and...
it was terrible but...
I just wanted to impress you.
you're a really sweet sister, you know that?
mom?
hi... baby.
mommy's right here.
thank you for seeing me, Francis.
please sit down, Your Excellency.
I made you some tea.
I see. Thank you.
I won't stay long.
I'm on my way to deliver a benediction at the UN.
they need it.
I always knew you had great things in store for you, Francis.
thank you.
and now look at you here in the catbird seat.
hot seat, sometimes.
tell me about it.
Oh, Francis.
we have such fine schools.
95% of our students go on to college.
they outperform every state and city test you can throw at them.
and to lose more schools...
I have thought about this problem long and hard.
Francis, when we last spoke, you reminded me of something.
what was that, Your Excellency? - The truth.
was I sacrificing truth for expedience in shipping the problem to South America?
and the answer was "yes.
but now...
we're going to face this problem head-on.
how'd the board meeting go?
there's enough in the coffers for Comforting Community to fight for another year.
that's great, Pop.
what's better, Francis, is that Bishop Donovan changed his mind.
father McMurray doesn't have to go to Bolivia after all.
always nice to hear good news.
this is so cool. Right and left.
look at that lady's shoes!
thanks for letting me skip school, Mom. You're just the best.
Yeah, well, it is quite a show, and the show hasn't even started yet.
Where's Aunt Linda? - I don't know.
can't we go inside? I'm dying to see Cousin Sofie. I can't believe she's opening fashion week.
God, the traffic. And the parking rates are outrageous. You know they hiked them up for all this.
well, look who's bringing sexy back. - stop it.
it looks beautiful. - Mom's not kidding.
you look fierce. - so do you. Let's go.
wait. There's a tag. Let me just... - no, no. Don't touch it.
I'm returning it tomorrow.
Linda Reagan. - I know. I know.
I'm a horrible person. I already said a preemptive novena.
this smells like a Wendy thing. - You know me and my sister.
you graduated at the top of your class.
you spent ten years on the floor at Kings General, and you are a world-class mom.
you're sweet.
all she sees is that I still bear the Scarlet Letter of New York City the dreaded 718 Staten Island area code.
I think it's cool. - I do, too.
speaking of which...
look at you! Is this Bianco Alessi, Linda?
that must have set Daniel back some change. Look at you. If I had those cheekbones.
how's the Commissioner? - Good. Thank you.
it's been two years. - I heard that.
I am so excited you guys are here.
this is the day we've been working for since Sofie started modeling.
backstage is a madhouse. We can't all go.
you guys find your seats. You are coming with me.
okay.
Oh, my God! Auntie Linda!
down girl. I'm curling. This thing's hot.
Harry, this is my Aunt Linda. This is my friend Harry.
incoming. - Here's our little catalog girl.
big day for you, sweetie. Just be careful you don't fall down out there.
you're still here, Cameron? What happened to my mineral water?
Ex-supermodel with a TV show.
I guess Page Six wasn't lying about Milli Skye. I mean, talk about toxic.
she was just trying to jinx you, Sofie, and it won't work if you don't let it.
I just can't wait for this to start. - We are so proud of you, Sof.
why don't you go on in, Linda, and let her focus?
this is exactly what I don't want to see when I open the paper.
some pedestrian's photo of one of my officers behind the wheel of his RMP... texting.
no, I don't want to see the officer. I want his boss to come to the 14th floor forthwith.
my day, we used to have to pull them out of bars.
Francis, I worked the breakfast line at Comforting Community this morning in the church's basement.
one of our parishioners gave me some unsettling news.
this is turkey, right? - Yeah.
it's dark meat? - I said it was for you.
I don't even want to talk about it out loud because it might make it come true.
she heard that Father McMurray is leaving.
has he got some kind of health issue?
Lucy's pretty plugged in to St. Luke's.
she said they're transferring him to Bolivia.
well, that doesn't make any sense. It's a little late in the day for that kind of change.
I don't want to even think about St. Luke's without him.
he's meant so much to the family.
buried my Betty. - Mary and Joe, too.
I thought he was going to bury me.
aunt Wendy, this is beyond incredible.
Erin, you... - Oh, please.
Sofie. There she is.
Oh... my... God. - She's stunning.
Oh, my God. Sofie! Sofie. Sofie, wake up. Sofie. Call 911.
is there a doctor?! - I know CPR. What's happening?
what's going on?
she has a pulse. She's just unresponsive.
Milli. - Stay with her.
Oh my God, Milli. - Somebody do something.
can you hear me? - She just collapsed.
Oh, my God. She's dead.
I don't know what happened. She wasn't feeling good. I pushed her.
you couldn't have stopped her from going out there, Wendy.
people think these models starve themselves or go on drugs, but not Sofie.
and Milli's dead? That cannot be a coincidence.
Oh, God, Mrs. Lightner. I came as soon as I heard. How is she?
what happened? - We don't know. She's in a coma.
is she going to be all right?
well, they're stabilizing her until they can figure out what happened.
this is Atlanta. She's been a big sister to Sofie since the beginning.
atlanta, this is my sister-in-law, my niece, my little sister...
Mrs. Lightner, can I talk to you for a moment?
it's fine. They're family.
we just got back the tox screen of the contents of your daughter's stomach.
I'm afraid they found a foreign substance believed to be a poisonous mushroom called Amanita phalloides.
a mushroom?
the death cap. It's one of the most poisonous mushrooms in the world.
science class.
someone poisoned Sofie?
well, we don't know how she came to ingest the mushroom, but the good news is, now we know that, we can focus on restoring her liver function.
unfortunately, we're too late for the other woman who ingested a larger amount.
who would do such a thing?
well, that's what the police are going to have to find out.
bless me Father, for I have sinned. I has been two weeks since my last confession.
these are my sins. I lost my temper at Sunday dinner, and swore in front of my grandchildren.
I was angry at my son.
Danny? - Exactly.
what did you say? - The big one.
I see. The temper, Frank we've talked about that.
I know that, Father.
all right, say two Our Fathers, five Hail Marys and a good Act of Contrition.
thank you, Father.
so, it took you two weeks to stir up one sin?
I heard you're leaving St. Luke's. - So much for keeping the transfer quiet.
is this something you really want?
I've had a good run at St. Luke's, Frank.
bolivia will be an invigorating new challenge.
father... is there anything I can say that will change your mind?
I'm a parish priest, Frank. I go where I'm asked.
these mushrooms that poisoned your friend, they usually take 12 to 20 hours to have this kind of effect, so it's important that we track the whereabouts of Milli and Sofie during that time period.
and Sofie's mother told us that Sofie was at some party last night at Milli Skye's loft.
we all were. It was her annual kickoff party for Fashion Week.
okay, was there anyone at that party that you know of would want to hurt your friend?
Sofie? Absolutely not. She's the sweetest girl in the world.
besides, she hasn't even been in this business long enough to make any enemies.
okay, what about Milli? Is there anyone who would want to hurt her?
everybody. - Everybody?
Atlanta! Oh, my God. - Harry.
what's going on? Where is she? - Sofie's on a respirator and dialysis.
it's horrible. And she's got swelling on her brain.
does Dorian know? - Who's Dorian?
it's Sofie's new boyfriend.
and who is this?
this is Harry. He's my best friend, and Sofie's hairdresser.
these are the detectives. They were just wondering if there was anybody at the party last night who would want to see Milli dead.
everybody.
okay.
Yeah, Reagan, I don't know.
I don't know anything about, you know, fashion models and-and poisonous mushrooms.
I don't, either, but I'm doing it for my wife, for her sister.
Oh, the sister I don't hear anything nice about.
and you never will hear anything good about her, but unfortunately, her daughter's in a coma,'cause someone tried to kill her, and they did kill Milli.
all right, okay.
thank you for seeing me, Father.
I called you Father. Old habits die hard, Your Excellency.
well, it's never too soon to start talking about security for the Pope's visit next year.
what are you really doing here, Francis?
you always could see through me.
well, it goes with the miter.
well... I'm not here as the police commissioner. I'm here as a parishioner.
you want to know why I'm transferring Father McMurray out.
I do. The Reagan family has a strong bond with the Father.
these are hard times for the church, Francis.
I've had to close six schools in our diocese, even our own St. Brendan's.
a sad day. I got a good education there, so did my children.
have you spoken with Father McMurray?
I have. He said nothing that would indicate he had a problem with the move.
well... - Well, I'm a cop, Your Excellency.
it's really more about what he didn't say. Something's wrong.
a woman has accused Father McMurray of inappropriate behavior...
of a sexual nature.
does she have any proof?
in the current climate, proof is not necessary.
Francis, you came to me a while back and reminded me that the church can no longer afford to sweep things under the rug.
the woman is demanding he be removed from St. Luke's. We're facing the issue head-on.
this man buried my wife and my son. He baptized Jamie. Father McMurray is a good man.
what this woman is saying is not possible.
it is just as important to exonerate an innocent person as it is to convict a guilty one.
that's what they teach us at the Academy from day one.
I know you share this belief.
Father...in so many ways, I will always be the student, and you the mentor, so this is not easy for me to say, but you are not facing this problem head-on.
this is just another way of sweeping things under the rug.
to ignore this woman's accusation would bring tremendous negative attention, which the church can ill afford.
father McMurray leaves at the end of the month.
okay. Yes. Whatever. - What's up, Jack?
the mushroom samples have been sent to the DEA lab in D. C.
it seems that they can figure out exactly what country these death caps came from.
great. When we found out where, we'll take a look, see who went there and when. What else?
Yeah. Well, our lab is going over everything they found backstage at the fashion show.
well, Timeline-wise, Milli's party is the best bet.
well, that's good news and bad news. - Bad news first.
well, the bad news is, the loft was completely cleaned out, and the caterers got rid of all the old food.
anybody getting the caterer's story? - Yeah, as we speak.
all right, how about the good news?
good news is, while you were downstairs, this came from Milli Skye's network.
it seems that she had a camera crew recording all six plus hours of the party for Milli's reality show.
that is every minute of her every move.
well, maybe we'll get lucky, catch a killer in the act.
worst case, we get to see how the beautiful people party.
there's a young lady here to see you about the Milli Skye case.
are you Detective Reagan? - Yeah.
cameron Swanson. I was Milli Skye's personal assistant.
mind taking off your sunglasses?
I knew you'd catch me anyway. I'm here to report a crime.
kill Milli? Me?
I stole from her, that is all, and I didn't really steal from her because that money was mine.
let's say you were stealing and that's all.
why don't you take us back to the beginning of you and Milli?
that morning, the morning of the party, they didn't have any lactose-free for her latte, so I used soy milk, and she starts screaming at me.
I told her I was quitting, and I wanted my money, but she didn't give it to me, so I tried to leave, and she said I couldn't because she needed me for the party, and when I tried to go, she took her cell phone and smashed it into my face.
the black eye. - I just wanted my $1, 200.
I knew she'd be distracted during the party, so I snuck in. I knew where she kept the cash.
I have it here, and I can give it back. - No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
if you quit, then why were you with Milli the next day at the fashion show?
she said she'd tell my parents I'm bulimic.
all right. Suppose we believe you. Suppose you're telling the truth.
is there anything you saw at the party that would help us find out who killed Milli?
anything you know, anybody acting suspicious? Tampering with the food in the kitchen? Anything?
well, Sofie's new boyfriend, Dorian...
baby rock star Dorian? What does he have to do with it?
I saw him... saw him shaving something onto Sofie's risotto.
Sofie's risotto? Not Milli's?
I don't know. I told you I was only there for a second. I didn't see much, but I saw that.
sit tight for a second.
I don't know. Maybe we have been looking at the wrong vic.
I mean, maybe Sofie was the target, Milli was collateral.
who would want to kill Sofie and why? - I don't know.
I mean, boyfriend's as good a place as any to start.
what about her?
well, Milli's not exactly around to press charges.
knowing my track record with a certain someone at the D. A.'s office, they probably cut her loose anyway.
Yeah.
NYPD INTRANET
your Search Term: Lydia Gonsalves is Restricted
your Search Term: Gonsalves Lydia is Restricted
look at this guy.
we got a sector to patrol, and you're playing Facebook?
no. It's just, uh...
everything all right? Yeah. - yeah, yeah.
so go, uh, inventory your RMP. I'll meet you in the lot.
you got it, Sarge. - All right.
Hello, Frank.
didn't mean to disturb you, Father. - not at all.
back for another run at the booth so soon?
I need to talk to you. - Please sit.
I went to see Bishop Donovan.
the woman was a member of the parish years ago.
she didn't have an easy life. She imagined she was in love with me.
we're taught to expect this as priests.
there were letters and gifts.
and she finally made a physical advance, which I, of course, gently deflected.
and I thought that was the end of it.
and it was.
but after a failed marriage, she moved back into her parents' house and to the parish.
I think she feels shame in herself at the sight of me.
have you told this to Bishop Donovan?
the Bishop is between a rock and a hard place.
the woman is imbalanced, Frank. She has a history of psychiatric illness.
but if we defend ourselves by revealing this, it will only bring up the church's recent history of having turned a blind eye to legitimate claims of abuse.
this isn't right.
and you falling on your sword isn't the answer.
I'm not a martyr. The Church has plenty of real ones.
I'm at peace, Frank.
I wish the Reagan family could say the same.
it's like a nest of vipers, bunch of phonies.
it's amazing. They all hated Milli Skye, yet they're all at her party.
typical.
there's Milli.
okay, this is Sofie right here. That's my niece.
she's a pretty girl.
what's that?
that's her boyfriend, Dorian.
he's a guy? - Yeah, that's a guy.
he's a musician. He's a big, famous dude.
famous with who? - With kids.
you know, young girls. He's this new wave, new punk.
and you know this because?
stupid magazines at the hair salon.
hold on. Pause that.
what is he doing there?
the girl with the black eye, she said he put something on top of Sofie's food.
well, he's doing it right there. - Right.
what is that?
it's like a mushroom or something. It's not Parmesan cheese, I'll tell you that much.
look. Look. Look at the frame in the back. It's Milli's assistant with the dark glasses.
well, she said she saw him put it on there, so...All right, let's keep watching.
Nope. Look at this. Milli didn't even get any of that stuff.
no.
keep watching.
look, at that. Milli took Sofie's plate.
there. Milli got some. Just maybe wasn't by design.
Yeah, looks like she got a lot more than she bargained for.
Yeah, like being dead. Let's go snatch up this Dorian kid.
mind if we crash the party?
cops! - Shut up!
everybody, put your hands where we can see them.
kill that music right now!
we're looking for Dorian. What's his last name?
Dorian. - The rock star.
step aside.
get over there.
what are you doing with this, huh? What are you doing? Come on. Come on, rock star. Come on.
look what I found. - Mushrooms.
everybody in here is gonna cry. "Everybody in here's gonna fry, fry.
I'm starting with the beauties ""'cause they're so bleeping snooty.
look at all the models. Watch them die, die.
and now a model's dead.
it's just a song. - A song about killing models.
how convenient would it be if your girlfriend, a model, happened to die right when your new video was being released?
that would be number one with a bullet.
you think this is some kind of joke?
less than 48 hours after your girlfriend slipped into a coma and some woman died because somebody gave them some kind of poisonous mushroom, you're having a drug-fueled party and flushing what appears to be the murder weapon right down the toilet.
I told you, they're psychedelic mushrooms.
well, I got a video of you shaving something that sure does look like a mushroom onto - Sofie's risotto at Milli's party. - What are you talk...
Yeah, you mean my truffle? - What?
I'm talking about a poisonous mushroom.
no, man, it's a truffle I bought at Mario's charity auction to feed the needy.
it gives me good cred. That thing set me back two grand.
a chocolate truffle? - No, no, man. Not chocolate.
it's like a... it's, like, mushroom, but not a poisonous mushroom. Like a...Like a tuber, I think.
$2, 000? - Yeah. They're rare or something.
anyway, I didn't give any to Milli, and she's the one that's dead.
okay. Why don't you tell me what you did with the rest of this magical $2, 000 truffle?
it's gone. I gave it to a lot of other people at the party.
you got to ask yourself why they're not dead, too, right?
no, I don't have to ask myself anything.
but what I do keep wondering about is why you haven't asked any questions about your girlfriend.
I mean, she's in a coma. You haven't even asked how she's doing.
I know. I-I'm sorry. I-I forgot.
right. Your girlfriend's dying. It just slipped your mind.
Yeah. Well, see, that's the thing. - What's the thing?
she's not really my girlfriend. - She's not your girlfriend?
no. It was like an arrangement. It was my manager and her mother.
Wendy thought it would be a good idea for Sofie's rising star, the red carpet and Page Six and like that.
so this arrangement? What did you get from it?
I'd rather not say. - Really?
okay. Well, you don't say.
I'll just charge you with homicide and get on with my day.
protection.
from what? Protection from what?
from rumors. - What type of rumors?
the kind that if a young teenage girl were to hear, she would never buy another Dorian ticket.
look, the truth is that I was a lot more interested in her friend Harry than I was in Sofie.
Reagan? Talk to you? - Yeah.
I just discovered that Sofie was Dorian's beard.
Really? - Yeah.
well, one thing the guy's telling the truth about
the lab results just came in on those mushrooms he was trying to flush down the toilet bowl.
they're psychedelic.
I guess the truffles weren't poisonous either, then.
I don't know. This is very confusing.
well, what we do know is that somebody tried to poison someone.
one woman is dead, and a girl is in a coma.
let's just hold him for possession of a controlled substance till we figure this thing out.
Yeah.
morning.
any change?
she's breathing on her own. The liver chemistry's better.
Wen... they don't think it was the musician anymore.
the mushrooms that they confiscated were a recreational drug.
dorian had no reason to harm Sofie. They barely knew each other.
I know.
Daniel told you about the arrangement?
you must think I'm horrible.
it's, um...It's just hard for me to understand.
what? Why I pushed my daughter to get mixed up in some creepy, fake relationship with a drug-addled rock star in the closet so she could get her name in the paper?
get her face on the cover of some stupid magazine?
you don't think I feel bad enough already?
I didn't say that. - That's what you were thinking.
little Miss Staten Island Salt of the Earth.
Wendy, please stop. - You stop.
you blame me because I wanted a better life.
this is better? - There it is. The contempt.
I was trying to be sympathetic, Wen.
is that so? Just leave me and my daughter alone.
Wen... - Get out of here!
well, the woman has a history of mental problems.
so what's going on? Why are they kicking him out?
he's a sacrificial lamb. - I'm not following you, Dad.
it'll look like they're latching on to this to excuse themselves for allegations that they've ignored in the past.
well, thanks, Harvard. - You asked.
that isn't fair. - No it isn't, Nicky.
but it isn't simple, either. If it goes public, it hurts the Church.
no kidding. I'm in the middle of a fund drive for Comforting Community.
if people get turned off, if they don't ante up, what's going to happen to all those senior citizens we serve?
so what do you think, Dad?
I was kind of hoping to find out what you guys think.
it's a tough one. I mean, I can see it from both sides.
Yeah, me, too. - Lawyers, what do you expect?
well, I'll take a side. It stinks.
I'm not talking about the legality. It's not a question of due process, it's an ethical issue.
Yeah. Is the Church making the Father pay for its former sins?
Yeah. On the other hand, Father McMurray isn't resisting, right?
right.
of course not. He loves the Church. He's willing to make the sacrifice.
are we being selfish for not wanting to lose him?
are we putting our wishes before the needs of the Church?
that's all well and good. But somebody should take a side. He's a good priest. It stinks.
well, I think we should have faith that Bishop Donovan will do the right thing.
everything has a cost, even the truth.
but the reward for truth is a clear eye and a clear conscience.
who said that? - Bishop Donovan, when he was at St. Brendan's.
I just hope he remembers it.
brought you some of Staten Island's finest, Jackie, and some fresh jet fuel.
thank you.
any results from the DEA in D. C. yet?
Yeah. The mushrooms that killed Milli and poisoned Sofie, they came from Morocco.
and they were purchased fresh and harvested no more than a month ago.
you got any airplane manifests from Morocco?
passenger lists for the last six weeks just to be safe from Marrakech and Casablanca.
this is from Iberia Airlines. - Rock the Casbah.
so far nothing on American. But I'm checking Air France now.
Newark to Marrakech, via Paris...What was that-that hairstylist? What was it? Harry? Barry?
right here. Seat 30A, three weeks ago.
Harry, that sweet little hairdresser kid?
maybe. Why don't we go pay him a visit? We'll check the rest of the manifests on the way.
I hear music. - Yeah, pretty loud.
maybe he's home.
Harry Bell! Open the door!
well, you know, the neighbors have been complaining about loud music.
so... - Right.
Dorian! A clean park. New York City thanks you.
no, no, thank you.
I got 99 more hours of community service to do for something that grows in God's earth.
well, it may grow in God's earth, but it's still illegal.
the other day you told us you'd rather hang out with Harry than you would with Sofie, is that right?
Yeah. We had our moment. Why?
well, Harry the hairdresser's dead. Apparently, he committed suicide.
Harry's dead? - Yeah, that's what I said.
now, the problem for us is Harry had just become our main suspect.
he was on a plane to Morocco, where the mushrooms came from, but we don't have a motive or any reason why he would kill himself.
maybe you could shed some light on that for us.
Morocco? Yeah. That-That's actually where Harry and I had our time.
but he didn't say anything about mushrooms.
you were in Morocco? We didn't see your name on the airplane manifests.
Yeah, well, I don't fly commercial.
so you had a private jet? - Yeah. That's why I went to Morocco.
Harry was working on a photo shoot for Atlanta's Marrakesh spread.
Atlanta? Sofie's mentor? Atlanta was on a private plane to Morocco with you?
I gave her a lift. Like I said, perception is everything.
that would explain why she wasn't on the passenger list.
we're looking for Atlanta.
she just went upstairs for a smoke. Why? What do you want?
Atlanta! Detective Reagan, my partner Detective Curatola.
you remember us from the hospital... - Don't come any closer!
listen, all right... - I'll jump! I will!
all right, I'm stepping back. Nobody's going to jump.
just get out of here! - We can't leave you up there, okay?
we're not going to leave you unless we know you're safe.
so why don't you just relax and we'll talk about this, okay?
you have no idea what it's like for me.
I'm 25 and my life is over.
I've been working Fashion Week since I was 13. I booked a dozen shows a year.
but this year? One show. And I had to beg for it.
okay, you don't want to jump because of that. Okay?
and it's not fair! I didn't mean to hurt anybody!
okay, you didn't mean it.
I just thought it would make Sofie sick, and that-that I would get to close the Lara Fortunato show.
I put it in her risotto when she wasn't looking.
but I don't know what happened to Milli. And now...
Harry, and that's my fault, too?
look, it's not your fault. Harry killed himself, okay?
I killed him. We were in this bazaar in Marrakesh.
the shopkeeper had these mushrooms, and...
Harry didn't see me buy them, but he suspected me...
okay.
I told him that if he ratted me out...
that I would say that we did this together. He's dead because of me.
no, he's dead because he killed himself, all right? It was an accident; it's not your fault.
so why don't you just get down from there, okay?
come on down, all right? Come on. Don't do this to yourself.
just take my hand. Come on down. Come on down. There you go.
come on. Come on down. There you go. All right.
Yeah, you just stand right there.
atlanta aka Lisa Jennings, you are under arrest for the murder of Milli Skye, attempted murder of Sofie Lightner.
let's go. Please. - Let's go.
I'm sorry. I was awful to you yesterday.
well, if it was one of my boys, I don't know what that would do to me.
Oh, don't be nice, Linda. I can't stand it.
had a lot of time to think about things. Making some changes...
if Sofie comes out of this.
well, don't even think about moving back to Staten Island.
you'd go nuts. Just saying.
she was surrounded by some desperate people, and I should have known.
I just wanted it for her so bad. I closed my eyes to the truth.
you were doing what you thought was best. Every mother is guilty of that.
you would have known. You would've seen right through them all.
I've always envied that about you.
you've envied me. Right.
I mean it.
you have always known exactly who you are.
you have never once pretended to be something you're not, not for anybody.
me? I have spent my whole life trying to forget where I came from, trying to be something I'm not.
look where it got me. - Well, I'm guilty of that, too.
I doubt it.
that wasn't my dress the other day.
what? - I bought it that morning...
kept the tags in it. I was going to return it the next day.
Linda. - I know. It was stupid and...
it was terrible but...
I just wanted to impress you.
you're a really sweet sister, you know that?
it was Staten Island.
mom?
baby.
mommy's right here.
thank you for seeing me, Francis. - Please sit down, Your Excellency.
I made you some tea. - I see. Thank you.
I won't stay long. I'm on my way to deliver a benediction at the UN.
they need it.
I always knew you had great things in store for you, Francis. Thank you.
and now look at you here in the catbird seat.
hot seat, sometimes. - Tell me about it.
Francis. We have such fine schools. 95% of our students go on to college.
they outperform every state and city test you can throw at them.
and to lose more schools...
I have thought about this problem long and hard.
Francis, when we last spoke, you reminded me of something.
what was that, Your Excellency? - The truth.
was I sacrificing truth for expedience in shipping the problem to South America?
and the answer was "yes." But now...
we're going to face this problem head-on.
how'd the board meeting go?
there's enough in the coffers for Comforting Community to fight for another year.
that's great, Pop.
what's better, Francis, is that Bishop Donovan changed his mind.
father McMurray doesn't have to go to Bolivia after all.
always nice to hear good news.
so...
what did you think?
well, who knew that beef lollipop and foie gras mousse and mint could be so delicious.
you're making fun of me. - No, I loved it.
now I see why it's so hard to get in this place.
I had the best day today, Maggie.
you should see your face right now-- you're beaming.
it's all the sun we got on the water taxi to Battery Park.
I gotta say, the Statue of Liberty from that perspective...
really was something. - Yeah.
guys? Excuse me,
I hate to interrupt but they want me to close out for the night.
Oh sure. You need us to settle up? No problem.
how was everything? - Fantastic.
my wife kept telling me, Iowa's got nothing like this.
that's the state that grows all the corn?
or is it potatoes? - Oh, corn.
though most of what I grow now is turned into biofuel. Ethanol.
it's a renewable energy source.
my husband loves his work. - Cool.
well, listen, enjoy the rest of your trip.
for you.
thank you. You sure I can't get you anything else before I go?
no, we're fine. I am just going to go and have my after dinner cigar.
but not right outside, okay? Customers hate it.
but a little ways down to the left is cool.
I'll be back before you finish your sambuca.
Hey. - Sorry I'm late.
well, you said you were running a half-hour behind, so that makes you on time.
long day?
some eight-hour days feel like a week.
Yeah.
anything you want to unload?
how are you? - Me?
well, I'm headed for another run-in with the Port Authority...
Ian Boyd was shot dead today.
good. Who shot him?
a convenience store owner he was trying to rob, but not before he was...
able to kill a young woman who was also in the store.
she was trying to warn the owner she saw a gun. Ian shot her.
she was pronounced dead at the scene. - I'm sorry.
he should have been behind bars from the last robbery.
that was a jury's decision. - Yeah, on a case that I lost.
and because I lost it, he was back on the streets, and because of that, a young woman is dead.
you can't tell me I don't bear some responsibility for that.
okay.
menus or another round?
both.
did you try the monkfish? - I wanted to.
it all sounded good. I had the bay scallops...
what's going on?
Oh, God! Lance, no!
call 911!
Hurry! My husband's been shot!
all right, let me get this straight. The shots ring out, and after a quick peek the customers all just go back to eating their meals, - like nothing happened? - That's what they said.
must be one hell of a restaurant - -make you wait around for six months for a reservation, then they don't even let a man getting shot interrupt their dinner.
what else you got for me?
well, the victim was a tourist from Iowa, Lance Olson.
he's at St. Benjamin's Hospital, with the wife... Margaret.
shot three times.
all his money and his credit cards taken.
you find a gun? - No. Not yet.
keep searching. And what about the canvass?
some of the people were sleeping.
and, the one's that were awake apparently didn't think it was that big of a deal.
gunshots are not new to this neighborhood, no matter how many fancy restaurants they put on this street.
canvass again, just in case somebody didn't answer their door.
and widen the search perimeter for the weapon, okay? - Right.
you know, Jack? You know what I can't figure out?
nice, well lit up area right here, nice little bench.
why is the husband over there smoking next to a dark Dumpster?
well, the manager says that's where they steer the smokers.
iowan tourist gunned down in the, uh, Big Apple.
press is going to eat this up, so to speak.
Yeah, well, it's not our problem. - No.
why are you still up?
Oh, Erin got some bad new tonight. You remember the Boyd case?
sure. Where her eyewitness got ripped apart on the stand.
well, he shot and killed a young woman in a robbery attempt earlier tonight, before the bodega owner killed him.
how's she taking it?
as you can imagine.
poor baby.
she's successful because she's so hard on herself, but she pays dearly for it.
and I still worry about her like she's...
like she's your own kid?
does that ever go away?
not really. I'll make some coffee.
well, if I wasn't awake, I would be now.
what happened?
a tourist was shot on the Lower East Side. He's critical.
Mrs. Olson?
detective Reagan. My partner, Detective Curatola.
he just got out of surgery.
they think they stopped the bleeding, but they said it was... very bad.
we know it's a trying time for you.
we need to ask you some questions, and we're hoping that you can help us.
what am I going to do if he doesn't pull through?
we understand you were the first person to find your husband after he was shot.
did you see anyone, anything, anybody follow him out of the restaurant?
I heard the gunshots and I ran outside.
my husband was lying on the ground.
it's my fault. I dragged him here.
I came her with my girlfriends, shopping and seeing shows, and... I love it here.
and I wanted him to, as well.
Mrs. Olson, um...
when you were outside, did you see anything?
a car? Anyone around? - I don't know.
right when I was coming out, somebody passed me.
did you get a look at them?
it happened so fast.
was it a man, a woman?
did you see what they were wearing?
were they short? Tall? - Man.
he had on one of those, um, sweatshirts with a hood.
do you know what color?
blue? It was dark colored.
how about his face?
he had the hood up.
I didn't get a good look, because Lance...
Mrs. Olson, the manager of the restaurant said that your husband paid a very large bill in cash.
is it typical for him to carry a lot of cash around?
he likes to pay cash. He says businesses appreciate it.
okay, so he had a lot of cash on him.
who would have known that? Today? Yesterday?
we got in...
we stayed in the room at the hotel all night.
this is kind of a second honeymoon. We've been married ten years.
the bellman. The... cabdriver.
the waitress at the restaurant tonight.
lance gave her a really nice tip. That's Lance.
nice to everyone.
you've been very helpful.
we'll find out who did this to your husband, Mrs. Olson.
thank you.
Caucasian male, approximately 74 years old.
fixed posterior... - Condition the body's in;
he's been dead at least a day, I would say.
hundreds of people walk by, and nobody bothers to call, you know?
guess they figure he's homeless; who cares?
but he was someone's loved one.
figure... just being human should earn you better.
right? I mean... - Yeah.
excuse me, Dr. Trent?
reagan, it's our second crime scene, you can call me Laura.
Laura, I was just wondering, are you writing it up as natural causes?
well, insulin found on the body initially indicated complications arising from diabetes.
but neon green fluid in the mouth cavity could be antifreeze.
have to wait on the tox screen, though.
so you're calling it a homicide? - Preliminarily.
lots to learn back at the lab.
so it's totality of circumstances.
exactly. Why are you so interested? - I'm only on the job six months, so I figure the best way to learn is to... ask questions of smart people.
well, you're right.
ask questions, keep an open mind, work hard.
I appreciate you taking the time, Dr... Laura.
keep up the good work, Reagan.
Thanks. I'll try.
Attaboy. - What?
shame on you, Reagan. - What?
hitting on a doctor, over a body?
do you also flirt at funerals?
Hey, I'm just trying to learn, okay?
You-you-you jealous somebody else might have something to teach me?
knucklehead, go. - Okay, Sarge.
can we just jump right in?
do you have another speed? - No, I don't.
tourism in New York is a multibillion-dollar industry, partly predicated on a kind of safari model.
they're going to be disappointed if they don't get close to the lions and tigers, but really disappointed if one of them eats 'em. It's a fine line.
that's a pretty harsh way to put it.
Yes, it is, but that's the version the press will hammer you on.
this is a safe city. - Not for white Iowa farmer Mr. Olson, it turned out, and he's the story.
I am not going to try and parse this tragedy along racial divides.
with all due respect, it's not going to be your choice.
the elephant's already in the room. - I can speak to the facts.
I don't have to join the circus. - Frank, whether you like it or not, you're going to have to play to the house on this, just a little.
just enough to show that you share the outrage.
I do, Garrett. A man was murdered. - You know what I mean.
I hate that you know what you mean.
I'm just doing my job. - I hate that, too.
I can stall until Monday without looking like we're stalling.
the press conference must be timely, but independent of any progress on the case.
there can be no rush to judgment here. - Done.
thank you. - Welcome.
all right. Thanks.
well, we can forget about the cabdriver.
he picked up two fares after he dropped the Olsons at the restaurant, and his GPS shows him in Yonkers at the time of the shooting.
well, this waitress-- I don't know what to say.
I mean, she has no record, but we can't find her anywhere.
she won't answer her phone or her door.
well, she's a possible, though. I mean, she works in the restaurant.
she sees Mr. Olson pull out all that cash, she calls an accomplice,
Mr. Olson goes outside to smoke. Accomplish shows up, boom, - It all goes bad. - Right.
well, I have her employee record from the restaurant.
I'm thinking maybe an emergency contact can help us out somewhere.
what about the armed robberies in the neighborhood?
four of them in the last year. Two of them went unsolved, one guy's still in Rikers, and the fourth one,
Brian Stratton, walked because the, victim never showed up.
wait. You said Brian... Brian Stratton?
Yeah. Why?
Brian Stratton's her emergency contact.
the waitress? - Yeah.
you kidding me? - Yeah. Wait one sec.
and look at this.
his number was called from the, the restaurant phone just before she clocked out.
our possible just became a probable.
door's open.
looks like we're invited to the party.
think they're rolling on E? - The love drug?
this should be easy then.
Hey, you Ecstasy heads. Hey, you two.
get down. Get down.
you want to dance your way out of here?
Oh, yeah, totally. - Yeah? All right.
NYPD.
NYPD, morons.
you're coming with us for questioning in an assault case.
make that questioning in a murder case.
lance Olson just died.
what do you know. Get some clothes on.
Mrs. Olson has suffered a terrible loss.
she will have the full resources of the city at her disposal.
lowa tourist dies.
the person responsible for this heinous crime will be brought to justice.
you have my word, and that of the District Attorney's Office.
now, excuse me. - Do you have any idea who did this?
your sister's on the case? - Oh, yeah.
do you Reagans ever take a day off?
not if we can help it.
what about those yo-yos we brought in, the waitress and her boyfriend-- they back down to earth yet?
we'll find out. Which one you want?
uh, I'll take the dancer.
since you already had your turn with him.
funny.
you ever been to prison, Maya?
cause, I mean, they got no Ecstasy there.
nothing to make the mean people suddenly turn nice.
you follow me? - I know.
hmm. So what was your plan, hmm?
a little bump and grab, get what you can?
but you didn't have any idea Brian was gonna bring a gun along.
there was no gun!
all we did was go score some E.
she called me to pick her up, that's it.
right, right, right. Fancy electronics, couple hundred weekly on E.
money for that's got to be coming from somewhere.
we didn't jack anyone. - You know what?
Maya's probably already told my partner everything he needs to know, and she's probably got a sweet deal.
guess you're not getting one. - Come on, Maya.
just talk to me, all right? I promise, you'll feel better.
you'll go easy on the drugs and everything?
I'll see what I can do, talk to the ADA, but you need to tell me the truth right now.
how we get extra cash is, every once in a while,
I get a bunch of customers' numbers and sell them.
credit card numbers?
the guy I work with waits before using them so it doesn't track back to me.
okay. Now what about the shooting?
we had nothing to do with that murdered guy. - Come on, Maya.
Brian picked me up, and we went to East River Park to score.
come on. - That's it, I swear.
did you see anyone outside that restaurant? - No.
but a couple blocks away, we saw this black guy tearing down the street in a hoodie, maybe blue.
we nearly ran over him on Brian's Vespa.
we almost hit this crazy black dude with my bike.
does that help?
do your remember him well enough to work with our sketch artist?
waiting tables, you get a good memory for faces.
I hope you're telling the truth, 'cause if not, you're gonna remember this face for a long time.
extra uniformed officers and anticrime teams have already been rotated into the popular tourist areas in the Lower East Side, and other neighborhoods that are famously our city's nightlife destinations.
commissioner? - Commissioner?
isn't that a case of too little, too late, Commissioner?
no, it's question of reacting appropriately to a tragic incident that occurred in this city.
I would like to stress this here.
we have seen no uptick in any of the metrics that we depend on that says to me that the death of Mr. Olson was part of a trend or wave or whatever term you choose to overlay on it.
commissioner? - Yes.
you yourself have ordered an increased police presence in exactly the kinds of neighborhoods where this murder took place.
so that our citizens and visitors alike could enjoy an added sense of security.
and I didn't hear a question there. What's next?
here's my question, Commissioner.
can you honestly say that...? - If I say it, it's my honest opinion.
...that the effect of this brutal murder, in terms of the profile of this city and the $30 billion in tourism revenue we depend on, can somehow be minimized by your department's comforting statistics?
are you finished? - Yes, sir.
what we're really talking about here is that a well-to-do white male visiting from the Midwest was murdered in our city. Now, with the right kind of purposeful slant, you can resurrect an image of New York as a city of mean streets and roaming predators, one that sells newspapers and advertising minutes.
but from where I sit, the death of Mr. Olson, of two girls from Harlem in a drive-by shooting, of an elderly man from a mugging in the Bronx these are all equally unacceptable, and we try every day to do everything we can to prevent them from happening again.
thanks for coming.
those two flakes weren't lying about their alibi.
I found the drug dealer in the park just where they said he'd be.
and he ID'd Brian and Maya's pictures out of a dozen I have here.
said they show up every Thursday like clockwork.
well, I got the artist sketch of Maya's description.
it's in the hands of every uniform and detective on the Lower East Side.
they're checking it against surveillance cameras, dog walkers, stoop sitters, anybody with eyes on the streets.
I don't know. You think this guy's for real, - or a hallucination of some stoners? - I don't know. Their alibi held up.
hold on, partner. We may be batting a thousand.
a bodega owner just recognized the sketch. Let's go.
it's Pierre.
this Pierre-- does he have last name?
no. Just Pierre. He's Haitian.
drives a cab 12 hours a day, then jogs in the neighborhood afterwards.
you know, I've told him, a black man running at night is just asking for trouble.
he says it keeps him sane.
he comes in for water and plantain chips after his run.
do you know where he lives? - No. Is he in some kind of trouble?
uh, just need to talk to him. - Look, you say Pierre drives a cab.
you happen to know which company he drives for?
steady Cabs. Real sweatshop.
pierre says he gets only 80 bucks for a 12-hour shift.
good. You've been a real help.
I hope so. You know, most of my customers are a pain, but Pierre-- he's one of the good ones.
good to know.
Oh, here's number three.
that's the number that the guy from the cab company gave us.
yes? - Police.
can you open the door, ma'am? I need to ask you a few questions.
what's this about?
we're looking for Pierre Dornay. Is he here?
Yes. That's my husband, What's this about?
we need to speak to him, ma'am. Can you just get him, please?
Pierre, it's the police. They want to talk to you.
Hey. Go around, Jackie. - Yeah.
stop!
police!
hold up!
hold up!
stop!
where you going? Where you going?
get your hands down and turn around.
turn around! - I did nothing wrong!
Yeah, right, and I'm Mother Teresa.
Oh, and here they come, the vultures.
the only channel on their police scanners they care for.
all right, come on.
step back. I said, move it.
come on! Step aside.
come on, innocent people do not run from the police, Pierre.
in my country, they do.
is that because you were a dirty cop, and so they ran from you?
I did nothing wrong.
Yeah, well, your record from Haiti says you were thrown off the police force for stealing.
that is a lie.
I was trapped in the earthquake for three days.
I prayed to live.
and a man--he said that God sent him to dig, and so he dug day and night until he found me.
I knew from that point on, I must always be a good man.
so when I saw the others stealing on the force, I told.
they made up their lie to silence me.
Wow. That's a touching story.
it's the truth. - All right.
let's say you are telling the truth.
that would put you about two blocks from the restaurant right around the time of the shooting.
you see anything? You hear anything?
no. No, nothing of notice.
except a man who walked past me.
and what makes him so special?
he walked quick quick.
and he turned his head away like he purposefully didn't want to be seen.
anything else? - His clothes.
they didn't match.
on top he wore a big hoodie, and on the bottom were nice trousers and shiny leather shoes.
it was strange.
police got a break in the fatal shooting of Iowan farmer and tourist,
lance Olson, when a Haitian cabdriver, Pierre Dornay, was taken into custody for the brutal murder of the heartland visitor to New York City.
lance Olson, a pioneer in the development of sustainable biofuels...
all right, well, the wife didn't want to tell me, but since she lost her job Pierre's been more and more desperate for money.
I'm thinking this is a guy in the wrong place at the wrong time, Jack.
two witnesses put him running from the scene of the crime just after the shooting.
where he apparently jogs every night.
and when we go to talk to him, the guy dives out the window.
come on, Danny, that's guilty as hell.
I know he looks guilty, Jackie, but it doesn't feel right.
come on, maybe it's a coincidence.
the heartland pioneer attacked by the scary immigrant.
I mean, they're throwing this guy to the wolves.
doesn't feel right. - Uh, well, explain that to your sister.
detectives, I hear you have a good suspect in custody.
well, that's a matter of opinion, which at the moment is split.
you have anything on motive? - They're drowning in debt.
I mean, he has a list of thefts, although none of them are violent.
you know, we know it's a step away from robbing someone and hurting them at the same time.
I think we should go back to the wife, see if she can identify the suspect.
she said she didn't get a good look at the guy.
a statement she made a few hours after her husband was shot.
I think we should give her another opportunity.
opportunity for what, to-to make something up?
she said she didn't get a good look at the guy.
to tell us whether upon further reflection she can identify a suspect.
of course she can identify the suspect now.
his face is all over the TV. Come...
if she identifies Pierre now, it's gonna have stink on it, and you know it.
look, we have a visitor to this city who in one moment is holding hands with her husband across dinner and a few hours later, he's dead.
I think she should have the chance, if she can, to put the man responsible away.
okay.
doc.
got more questions?
I have a favor to ask.
I'm listening.
I've misplaced my memo book, containing my notes from the homeless man scene.
did the dog eat your homework, Officer?
I wish.
it's gonna make me look like that big of a jerk if I have to...
ask my boss to log me onto the system to get the information for the reports.
Yeah, that doesn't look good. - No, it doesn't.
so I was wondering if, um...
if I'd log you in here?
makes you a hero and me just a little bit less of a jerk.
you're lucky I have a soft spot for rookies.
I owe you one.
favor from a rook might not mean much, but...
Hey, you never know.
you say he spoke his mind; I say he shot himself in the foot.
then let's just agree to disagree, shall we?
the mayor would appreciate a clarifying statement.
every reporter there understood exactly what he was talking about
there's nothing to clarify or rescind, end of story.
the mayor requested it, end of story.
the commissioner regrets "that in his statements to the press "he didn't emphasize the need for visitors "to exercise reasonable caution in emerging neighborhoods - "where the underprivileged are being pushed out. - Oh, here you go.
where a bodega that still "takes food stamps sits next to a restaurant "that gets 50 bucks a plate for mac and cheese." How's that?
okay. I give up. But the mayor won't.
thanks for dropping by.
you're an idiot. - Thank you.
she's right, you know. - No, I don't know.
your position won't be compromised by embracing the fact that tourism is good for New York City.
equating the murder of a white, - wealthy tourist to an old man mugged in the Bronx... - That is not what I said, - and you know it. - I know it's how it was perceived.
only by someone who didn't bother to listen.
the mayor listened!
we're done here, Garrett.
I'm Detective Reagan, ma'am. This is, uh...
Erin Boyle, with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.
I'm Margaret's sister, Leslie.
we were hoping to speak to her if we could.
come on in. She's resting.
this is my husband, Mark.
and... - I'm Carl Perry, friend of the family.
he was kind enough to fly us here.
I'll go get Margaret.
so, uh...you two from Iowa also?
Yeah. We're, um...
we haven't had a murder in my hometown for five years, Detective.
you lure people here with your glitzy advertising, and then put a fancy restaurant in a hellhole...
while the armed criminals roam the streets.
you guys just get in or something?
Yeah, this morning, and, uh, we're just staying long enough to get my brother-in-law's body - and fly him back home. - All right, all right, Mark.
take it easy, all right? They're here to help.
how are you doing?
I'm numb.
Mrs. Olson, we could use your help, if you're up to it.
you said that you didn't clearly see the face of the man who was running from your husband after he was shot.
has anything come back to you?
I don't think so.
we'd like to put you in front of a lineup to see if anything would jog your memory.
they said that you arrested somebody.
did you see any of that on the news?
no. I can't bear to watch it.
do you think you could handle the lineup?
I'll do anything to put Lance's killer behind bars.
okay.
let's go.
all right, I want you to take a look at all the men in this lineup, tell me if you recognize any one of them.
number five. I recognize him.
okay, where do you recognize number five from?
that's the man I saw running away from Lance after he was shot.
she picked him. - She got lucky.
we have two independent witnesses that corroborate.
come on, we just served this guy up on a silver platter for her.
well, then he'll have 20-to-life to commiserate with all the other murderers who insist they're innocent.
but I read that eyewitness testimonies are responsible - for a lot of wrongful convictions. - Yeah, but that cuts both ways.
sometimes it's the closest account to what actually happened.
and the best shot at making your case.
jurors hear what happened from a layperson, they perk up.
which is fine, Grandpa, as long as the witness really saw what they say they did.
she lost her husband-- what is she gonna gain by lying?
I don't know. But all I do know is, first she said she didn't see a face, then suddenly she saw a face, and of course, it turns out to be this guy all right.
who's plastered all over television.
Oh, Mom let us watch TV when you arrested that man.
he looks like a bad guy.
what do you mean, he looks like a bad guy, sweetie?
you know, scary. - Boys, listen.
we've all arrested guys
bad guys and scary guys, okay?
but you can't tell if a guy's bad or not just by looking at him.
I mean, we put a guy in handcuffs and we walk him in front of the news cameras, sometimes they look very scary, and it's really just because they're scared themselves.
dad, you want to weigh in on this?
Yes, I do.
the lamb was perfect.
too bad they didn't have lamb at your press conference, Francis.
whoa, Poppy. - Just telling it like it is.
for what it's worth, sis,
I think you're the one in the most difficult position here.
Oh, actually, it's the Haitian guy who's in the worst position here.
I'm clearing.
I like these cabinets; they're original to the house.
cool it.
I know you two are supposed to be all grown up, but humor me here.
what makes you think this guy is innocent?
I don't know if he's innocent, Dad.
I just think with all the pressure on this case, the guy could use a devil's advocate on the inside.
this guy gave us a clue that only a good cop would know, Dad.
well, does that point you towards another suspect?
it opens the door to the possibility that maybe this wasn't just another street crime.
he's got motive, opportunity.
the wife puts him practically tripping over the body.
I don't know why Danny wants to complicate this.
and I don't know why you're so hot for this guy.
he's an ex-cop with a hard-luck story. Sympathize with him all you want, - just don't let it cloud your judgment. - I'm not.
Yeah, you are. - Erin.
you can't undo what happened with Ian Boyd.
I'm not... - Not with this case, not with any case.
you think I'm rehashing that here?
two felony murders, grieving relatives--you tell me.
you're not gonna back off of him, are you?
if he's the guy, I want him as bad as anybody else, including you.
and if he's not, I'd love some solid evidence.
you'll get it, by the book.
I'll hold off on the indictment.
well...
you know, when Jamie was born, we tried to move you two into the same room.
you remember that? - Sort of.
well, we couldn't afford it, but the very next day, your mom and I started looking for a bigger house.
true story.
come on in. You wanted to talk to me?
we, uh, just wanted to tie up a few loose ends, Mrs. Olson.
will this take long?
I need to meet everybody to sign the transfer permit so we can take Lance's body home.
you know, we're just looking at this case from every angle, you know, before we wrap it up.
you see, all along, we've looked at this as a crime of opportunity, but we wanted to at least consider the fact that maybe it wasn't random.
what do you mean?
well, maybe somebody wanted to harm your husband.
business associate, an enemy?
lance doesn't have any enemies.
so, this morning we revisited your husband's phone records, especially while he was here in New York, but we decided to go back a few months, and there's a lot of calls to a, Carl Perry.
Carl? He and Lance did business together.
you're not suggesting he had something to do with this?
you know, Mrs. Olson, this would be a really good time for you to be frank with us.
you see, when we accessed Carl's phone records, we noticed a lot of calls to your home at times that your husband's calendar show he wasn't there.
and your credit card records show three weekends at a Hotel Mandolin-- pretty romantic place, and you weren't with your husband.
we have the hotel confirming right now that you were actually with Carl.
you want to talk about it, Mrs. Olson?
my husband was away so much, so consumed by his work, and Carl...
he thought he was in love with me.
it was so wrong and-and stupid, but I broke it off and I swore to myself I'd make it up to Lance.
that's what this trip was about.
I asked you before, do you really think Carl could do something like this?
no, it's impossible.
well, jealousy is a strong motive, Mrs. Olson.
you never really know what someone is capable of.
thanks very much for coming.
come with me.
what's up? Is he sweating?
well, he's trying not to show it.
you get anything useful out of her?
well, they met at a dinner for Lance's biofuel investors.
apparently there was a spark she just couldn't ignore, and then at that Hotel Mandolin, where the two of them were canoodling last year, she learned that Carl was a junkie for champagne and breakfast in bed and, uh, partial to bacon, extra, extra crispy.
all right, let's see if we can use it.
this list of Lance's business associates will be very helpful.
thank you. - You're welcome.
one other thing.
you're a pilot. I mean, you pilots
y-you prepare for emergencies, right?
you do, like, dry runs.
you don't want anything to happen that you're not prepared for.
right, so hypothetically if you wanted to kill someone, say someone like Lance, you'd probably do a dry run, wouldn't you?
what are you saying?
no, this is crazy. I don't have to hear this.
you're going to hear everything I got to say.
why would I kill Lance?
because you love his wife.
that's what Margaret's telling my partner in the other room.
in fact, she's saying a whole lot of things about you.
let's see, she's talking about the Mandolin Hotel and champagne, breakfast in bed, and how you like crispy bacon and, uh, yeah, talking about the dry run you did.
here's a receipt.
it's your receipt from one month ago
the same restaurant where Lance was killed. Imagine that.
I came to N-New York on a business deal and I met with Ray Lawrence and we went to dinner.
why don't you ask him about it? - I did.
he said you chose the restaurant.
I don't know where to eat around here.
he suggested a few places and we decided on this one.
so how about the waiter--the waiter who you asked where somebody would go if they wanted to smoke?
lance smoked, didn't he? - So I come from Iowa to New York and I eat at the same restaurant and I have a smoke.
what's that prove? - I'll tell you what it proves.
it proves everything that Margaret is saying
that you wanted to be with her and you wanted to have Lance's money, too.
I know what you're trying to do.
do you?
how's it going in here?
well, that's up to Carl here.
you got a big decision to make, Carl.
your girlfriend's in there saying that you planned the whole thing and she begged you not to go through with it. Isn't that her story, Detective?
in a nutshell, yeah. She's very convincing.
Oh, yeah, she had to be convincing.
I mean, she convinced you to kill her husband and she convinced two seasoned detectives that her sob story was true.
it'd be a real shame if she pulled this one over on you, too, Carl.
you're lying to me.
you're trying to manipulate me.
okay, so Margaret gets her freedom and Lance's money, and you get 25 to life.
unless, of course, you got some information that contradicts her story 'cause we could just recommend that you're the one that gets the deal here.
I really need to get back to the hotel.
no, you really need to sit down for what we have to say to you.
sit down.
your boyfriend Carl has been chatting it up in the other room.
he just confessed to shooting Lance.
Oh, my God.
Carl shot Lance? Why?
she's good, huh?
remember this? You recognize it?
it's Carl's phone.
wow, that's the first honest thing you've said.
what about this? You recognize this?
it's done, babe.
you'll fly my sister here, everyone will feel so sorry for me, and then we'll be home free.
that isn't what it sounds like.
sure, it is-- it's your voice, and there's plenty more where that came from.
you traded in Lance for Carl, except Carl-- he had an ace in the hole.
he kept a few choice messages of yours.
all that happy anticipation about spending Lance's money, just without Lance.
you know... I really hate when people do bad things and blame it on my city.
I want a lawyer.
that's the second honest thing you've said.
get me a lawyer!
just needs your signature.
for immediate release.
the police commissioner today reluctantly announces the unexpected resignation...
long planned resignation.
...long planned resignation of Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Garrett Moore.
I know what it says.
I particularly like the part right here about"exploring new avenues.
makes unemployment sound... exciting.
glad you approve.
signed, Frank Reagan, Commissioner.
all in all, much better than the last one.
do you have a pen?
it pains me to do this, I want you to know.
Duignan neat, water back, on my pal here.
you cheap bastard, on my salary?
at least you still got one.
oldest story in the book, you know.
the lovers kill the husband for his money.
you came here to gloat? - Well, I could.
that'd make me a lousy brother, though.
on the other hand, if I came to tell you that
Nicky was with Linda and the boys and I got us a corner table at Chops, well...
I could use a scotch and a steak.
I figured you could.
since I kicked your ass this time.
Hey, guys, why don't you go upstairs and wash your hands before dinner?
I know I only met you guys at the wedding, but the amount of times your name comes up here, you would think that we were next-door neighbors.
well, we practically are now. Just over the bridge.
don't tell anyone, but I think he missed you.
well, I might've told some stories from the old days now and again.
Aw, do you miss me, buddy? Yeah, you know I do.
Oh, you should talk.
this one goes on about his boyhood BFF so much, when our kids were little, they thought Danny Reagan was the name of a superhero.
it's not?
she's funny. She's funny.
no, but all jokes aside, it's... having you guys here, it's like an early Christmas present. Same here.
and it's permanent now? It's official?
I mean, no more Florida?
Bye-bye, Boca. Hello, Bay Ridge.
Hello, Bay Ridge.
no, you know, with my mom being sick, it was time to come home.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that.
Thanks.
sit down, relax. Thank you.
but you know what's nice is that we'll actually get to know you guys after all these years.
Yeah, we should make something official, like, uh, once a week, either dinner or a game or something.
done and doner. All right.
we just hope you're happy here and you don't miss Florida too much.
speaking of missing Florida...
you must've done pretty well down there in the Sunshine State, my friend, with that, uh, snazzy Benz you pulled up in.
I got lucky.
I wind up in real estate after college.
right time, right place, I guess.
Mickey's being modest. He works really hard to give our family life's little extras.
babe, I'm gonna, um, take the trash cans out, okay?
Danny, we're about to sit. Yeah, I know. It's, uh...
if I don't do it now, I'll forget, so...
Tobotobally.
what on earth was that?
ob. I never told you about ob? Ob?
Yeah, it's- it's their secret language from fifth grade? That's right.
Danny made me learn that before we got engaged. Oh, brother.
Yeah. Here, have some more.
we're gonna need it.
the perp came running out of the liquor store with a bag of cash, and the clerk right behind him with a baseball hat.
I yelled, "Police, don't move."
I saw a flash, and the next thing I know, I'm lying here.
that flash was a. 9 millimeter in the hand of the wheelman.
I should have seen him coming. He was around a corner.
when he heard you, he came out blasting.
there's nothing you could have done.
the good news is the doctor says you're going to be just fine.
Yeah, he thinks I can go home tomorrow. With a medal pinned to your chest.
rest up. Thank you, Commissioner.
the press is going to want a few words.
what else is new? Commissioner.
as you were. Officer Wallace.
Yes, sir. Partner's doing fine.
and you both did good work. Well, we could have done better, sir.
he came out of a blind spot. You didn't stand a chance.
that's just it, sir. That perp never should have had that gun.
the shooter- I saw him casing that shop four hours earlier.
he kept patting his hip, you know, like there was a gun there...
but you didn't question him.
because of the new restrictions on Stop, Question and Frisk?
the judge says we could get sued personally if we do a wrong stop.
and you didn't want to take any chances.
I screwed up, didn't I?
no, son.
we did.
Hey, top of the morning, Sarge. There you are. Follow me.
little coffee first, boss? Now.
I got someone who needs to talk to you.
okay.
and bah humbug to you, too.
reagan, this is Lieutenant Sutton from OCID.
lieutenant. Is there a problem?
well, frankly, that's what we're here to find out.
this is you, isn't it, Detective? Yeah.
that was you taking pictures at my house?
Yes, it was. What the hell is going on here, Sarge?
you got OCID sitting on my house, taking pictures of me and my family?
no, they weren't taking pictures of you, Danny.
like hell they weren't. We weren't on you, Detective.
we were on your pal, Michael Patrick.
what... what the hell would OCID want with Mickey?
well, maybe because he's a known member of the Vasquez Family...
come on. ... the biggest crime family in Florida.
right. And I'm the Lord of the Dance.
I'm not horsing around, Detective.
look, it can't be, okay? It's not even possible.
last month, the key players from the top families across the country held a summit masquerading as a golf outing.
Yeah, right. Okay.
now, look, you got the wrong guy. Okay? Mickey's into real estate.
want to tell me what your buddy in real estate was doing with them?
there he is, with the rest of the Vasquez capos.
Mickey's a gangster?
have a seat, Detective. We're gonna be here a while.
quality of life crime is up 30%.
violent crime is up 20.
a judge rules against Stop and Frisk and basically says, "My work here is done.
and now you see the results.
we've got a wounded cop that almost didn't make it home to his family because this judge won't let our cops do their jobs.
this department dates back to 1845.
that's a whole lot of good police work done before anyone came up with Stop and Frisk.
I think we should get these numbers in front of the press.
to what end?
to get public opinion back on our side.
in an effort to...? Ignite debate.
Oh, come on, Garrett.
the last thing in the world this issue needs is more debate.
all due respect, I think Garrett is right.
people see those crime numbers, they might rethink the issue.
well, a lot of good it's gonna do them. The judge has ruled.
it's a bad call. Shouldn't we try to change it? Our job isn't to change the law.
our job is to uphold the law- even the ones we don't like.
Frank, in all the years I've known you, I've never once seen you willing to give up.
who the hell said anything about giving up?
he never gave any hints about his mob ties? No.
look, as far as I knew, Mickey was making a killing selling beachfront property to the Boca blue hairs. Well, he wasn't.
he was help bringing their crime business to the 21st century.
setting up shell companies, offshore accounts, et cetera.
okay, so if he's some Florida mob big shot, why'd he come back home?
expanding.
the Vasquez family has been building up relationships with some of the organized crime outfits up here.
your buddy Mickey is the go-between.
if what you're saying is true, well, then, I guess Mickey...
he deserves whatever he's got coming. I'm glad you feel that way.
good. Let me know how it goes.
actually, we were hoping you could help.
Yeah. Thanks, but no thanks. Well, you said it yourself.
he deserves what he's got coming. If what you're saying is true.
it is.
okay, suppose it is. It's a bad play.
Mickey's no idiot. He knows I'm a cop.
he's not gonna spill mob secrets to me just 'cause we goofed around on the monkey bars as kids.
I agree. We have to get creative.
look, there are a thousand other detectives who you could put on this besides me.
Yes, but there's only one that he trusts.
does it mean anything to you that he's my friend, that we grew up together?
means everything. Means you could get close.
you could put him in a compromising position.
it means if we flip him, we just took down the biggest mob operation in 20 years.
and it also means that I will have sold my soul.
I got cases to work.
right now, I'm asking for your help, Detective.
but I don't have to ask.
Mickey is a wise guy? That's what I'm saying.
it can't be, right?
well, I'm surprised, but I'm not exactly blown away.
what do you mean? It's not like I was an angel.
I mean, every time Mickey got in trouble, I was right there with him.
Yeah, which is why Dad never liked you hanging around him and always kept you on a short leash.
don't remind me.
you remember that time you guys got caught for shoplifting down at Jim Duffy's five and dime?
Yeah. Thought the old man was gonna pull the slapper out for sure.
Yeah, and that's when Mom wanted to send you to military school.
do you know why?
let me guess: because Mickey was a bad influence?
no. Because she always thought you had a blind spot when it came to Mickey.
you know, there's a story about that day that I never told anyone.
Mickey was halfway home when the cops rolled up on me.
now, anyone else would've kept going, but he didn't.
when he heard I was getting pinched, he turned around and he took the rap with me.
okay, so now he's a stand-up guy, is that it?
Oh... maybe.
maybe you still have a blind spot.
or maybe OCID got it wrong.
if they were coming to get you to lock up one of your friends, would you just take their word for it?
okay, you have a point, Danny.
if I was going after one of my friends,
I would make damn sure they were no good first.
talk to me.
Danny, 3151 West 49th Street.
I'm on my way.
I'll meet you in the lobby.
he just got off on 16. Sixteen.
punch me in the face.
what?
I'm not kidding. Come on, hit me.
detective, what the hell's going on?
we tailed Mickey.
keyed his way into an office on Madison under the name of Gator Empire, Inc.
it's a shell corp for the Vasquez family.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, so am I.
so, does this mean that you're in? On one condition.
you got to offer him witness protection. Done.
all right, go ahead and punch me. You're nuts.
just do it already.
come on, come on! You betting the ponies, Reagan?
I got a little action going, come on. Come on, come on! A lot of action?
he's ten lengths behind this horse!
how does he lose that race?!
unbelievable. Bartender! Two more.
Danny, how much you bet?
he's the back end of my double.
you bet a daily double? Reagan, that's a sucker bet.
Yeah, well, call me a sucker.
no, not the Danny Reagan I know.
now, why don't you tell me how you got a black eye?
don't worry about it, okay?
no, you know, that's what I do because that's what friends do.
look, I tell you, you can't tell a soul, okay?
no. Not even Connie.
I sobwobear obon moby lobife.
what's going on? Come on.
I'm in a hole, Mick.
yeah? Yeah.
how deep? 12 feet.
$12, 000? Things just got a little out of hand.
that's all. A lot out of hand, Danny.
you know how it is, Mick. I fell behind, I tried to double up and catch up.
stupid horse was gonna be my Hail Mary.
she didn't come through for you. No.
built a real house of cards.
behind on the car payment, the kids' tuition, took out a pension loan.
it's only a matter of time before Linda finds out, and that's when I'm really screwed.
listen to me.
I'm gonna help, all right? I'm gonna give you the money. No, no.
you're gonna pay me back when you can.
no interest. I insist. No, forget about it.
forget about it. Danny.
Mick, you and I both know what money does to friendships.
you've been gone all these years, you just got back;
I'm not gonna screw this up over my problems, no way.
I hear you, but what are you gonna do?
put in some overtime, couple odd jobs, I guess.
12 grand in overtime?
what other choice do I have?
well, let me think about this, look...
I might know a guy that might be able to give you some work.
yeah? Yeah, but no promises.
and no more betting. All right, no more betting.
Mr. Mayor.
I just got word from the hospital that they will be sending Officer Powell home this afternoon.
that's good news.
Yes, he's recovering nicely.
his partner's wounds, however, might take a while longer to heal.
I'm sorry, Frank, I wasn't aware there was another officer injured.
well, a few hours before the shooting, his partner observed the shooter and thought he might be carrying a weapon.
but fearing that a judge might rule his actions to be a violation of civil rights, he chose not to stop and question the individual.
if you've come here to tell me that your men and women are handicapped...
I didn't. ... because they can no longer toss black men against the wall for no reason, you've come to the wrong person. Aw, cut it out.
I know exactly where this is going, Frank.
no, you don't.
I'm not here looking to reopen Stop, Question and Frisk.
but our crime stats are now headed in the wrong direction.
I've seen the numbers, and I'm confident you can turn them around.
the judge's new rules say we must have significant cause before we stop and question individuals.
that's how it is. But we'd like some help.
Frank, I'll do anything I can to help.
you know that.
good.
I would like you to go to the press and explain that See Something, Say Something no longer applies to just stray backpacks and unattended luggage.
if we're gonna stop someone, we need to show just cause, and a phone call from a concerned citizen goes a long way.
Frank, you want me to ask the people of our city to be on the lookout for crime?
that's gonna make people nervous.
Mr. Mayor, the last two decades have shown dramatic decreases in crime.
our job is to sustain that under new and more challenging conditions.
but we can't do it alone.
let me think about it.
you don't want to go near this.
Frank, I said let me think about it.
please do.
you know, I can't believe you got a table in this place.
we've been trying to come here for months. How did you do it?
Oh, Mickey has a fancy friend.
some Wall Street guy I sold a house to, that's it.
well, that's what we need, hon. We need a fancy friend.
well, we got a fancy friend of a friend, how's that? Yeah!
you boys are funny. I gonna step to the ladies room.
