I'm going to call child services.
Yeah.
ma'am, I'm Nick Stokes; this is Mike Keppler.
we're with the crime lab. You mind if we ask you a few questions?
um, look, Courtney was supposed to come in the morning to pick up Lila, Okay.
I got to work. You know, real work.
okay, look, my own problems, okay?
otherwise, I would have taken her myself, but, um,
I ain't in no shape, okay?
so, uh, you can find her a family, right?
what about the father?
heard he was in prison or something like that. I ain't never seen him.
when she left the baby with you, was Courtney with anyone?
a friend maybe?
no, no, she ain't got no friends.
what about enemies?
you know what? I got to go. I can't take this.
please take her. Thank you. Please.
go with her.
I got to go.
looks like we have another victim, huh?
it's gonna be okay, baby.
we got to talk, Frank.
hold on, hold on, I'm on a streak here.
now, do I keep the ace or draw the inside straight? I'm gonna draw to the straight.
she had a kid.
Oh, god.
why don't you tell me about the hand?
Why?
she scratched me, Mike.
come on, what was I supposed to do?
I couldn't take the chance that one of your guys would find my DNA under her nails.
why, Frank?
you know why.
that was a long time ago; Dennis never said a word.
Yeah, but he was going to. He was about to be indicted.
wife, three kids. There was no way he was doing time.
he was going down, mikey, and he was taking us with him.
he was a cop, Frank. - Yeah.
you told me that.
you don't do that, not even to save your own ass.
yeah? What about yours?
Hey! Give me another vodka and tonic.
and give my boy here a scotch.
neat, right? Make it a double.
we got to loosen him up.
look at her. Just like catnip.
don't look at me like that, Mike.
we did the right thing, all of us.
but do you think the grand jury's gonna see it like that?
they're gonna see a white cop turned "dirty harry
goes across the river to take out some Puerto Rican drug dealer.
shoots him in the back.
they don't understand.
every time we take one step outside the box for public safety, they nail our asses to the wall.
sit down, Frank. - Hey, Mikey, there's no turning back.
you did the right thing. If you hadn't taken care of that evidence...
keep your voice down, all right?
come on, I need some help here.
or you're gonna lose everything.
and that isn't what amy would have wanted. She loved you.
don't do that. - What?
don't bring her into this.
you think you're the only one who cared for her?
I was her father, Mikey.
don't ever forget that.
I would've killed that the scumbag who raped her with these bare hands, but you got to him first.
I love you for that.
Yeah, I made compromises for you.
you wouldn't be here now if it wasn't for me.
Yeah.
you're out of line, Frank.
Hey, Mikey, there is no statute of limitations for murder.
the kid you shot, his mother's still crying.
and I got the gun...
with your prints and his blood on it.
you go down now, you take every case you ever worked on with you.
trenton, Philly, Baltimore, Vegas.
all those killers go free.
all on your hands.
so, pin it on the blond in the bathroom or the pimp.
just do it, I don't care how, just do it.
I don't even know Courtney what's-her-name.
so how is it that your prints ended up all over her apartment?
I've never been to her apartment.
did I mention she was dead?
what?
no, I don't even know no dead person.
PJ, you know what I think?
I think you killed her.
you took her purse, went to her apartment and stole all her stuff.
no, no, no. I didn't kill nobody.
well, she's dead.
and so is the cop she was with.
that's the death penalty.
here's what happened- I swear, this- this is the truth.
I was minding my own business.
I was checking out the dumpsters behind, behind the strip, and lo and behold, I find this lady's purse.
right there in the dumpster?
Yeah, like pennies from heaven.
it had a wallet, it had keys, it had a cell phone.
so I checked for her license, I got her address and went to her house.
I was going to return the purse, I swear.
Oh, like a good Samaritan?
Yeah, but, when I got here, no one was there.
so what'd you do?
I used the key.
I was going to leave the purse inside.
but you didn't do that, did you?
I might have taken a couple of things.
where was the dumpster?
behind the Palermo.
behind the Palermo.
this is Catherine.
Catherine, it's Mike.
where have you been?
I had to take care of something. How's it going?
any I. D. On the blonde yet?
no, but we got some info from the deadbeat who burgled the hooker's apartment.
claims he found her purse in a dumpster behind the Palermo.
I'm just off the strip now; I'll take care of it for you.
Mike, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
I'll see you in a little bit.
Hey, Mike.
Hey.
did you get anything from the dumpster?
yeah...
a bad smell.
so...
Ecklie wants you on days now that Grissom's back, but...
I could talk to them, get you to stay with us.
Oh, I'm sure you guys will do just fine without me.
Yeah, usually transfers don't fit in, but... think about it.
Thanks.
Archie found the mystery blonde.
before she was in dennis Graves' room, she was with that cop, Frank Mccarty.
they got on in the lobby, got off on 11.
around the time Mccarty said Dennis picked up his hooker.
Hey, he never mentioned he had company, and he knew we were looking for another hooker.
now I'm starting to think we're looking at a dirty cop.
who knows about this?
PD's about to.
I'm calling them right now.
you'd think a cop would know he's on camera, huh?
Mccarty's phone keeps going to voice mail.
and, according to the receptionist, he didn't check out.
LVPD. Open up.
give me the card.
I didn't do it...
I didn't do it, man.
come on, man; I didn't do it.
you got the wrong guy, man.
No!
it's a. 45 auto.
same caliber as the gun that killed the cop and the hooker.
with blood stains.
this this is practically gift-wrapped.
if the guy wants to get caught so bad, just confess make it easy on all of us.
I can't wait to get this back to ballistics.
I'll see you.
I'll finish up here.
you've reached Frank. Leave me a message after the tone.
Hey. You're back.
Yeah.
uh, I've - I've been out at a, um... I've been at...
a garbage dump?
Yeah. It's so obvious, isn't it?
nice, um...
you look good.
did you, uh, put the cocoon in my office?
cool, dry, not a lot of light. It seemed like the right place for it.
I think you're going to be surprised when it hatches.
I have no doubt.
I'm gonna... go clean up now.
I'll see you later.
Yeah, you will.
Mccarty's mystery blonde knew the dead hooker.
how do you know that?
check out the time code.
0.0486111111111
we recovered the hooker's cell phone, thanks to a dumpster diver.
these are all her voice mails,
at the same time the blond was making this call, Courtney Evans received a voice mail.
so, I synched up the audio to the video.
Yeah, Courty, it's me, Suzy Q. Got your message.
what are you, too busy to answer me back?
uh, so anyway, I just left my guy.
eh, it went all right.
usual "call me daddy" crap.
you know, he actually wanted me to whimper. Whatever.
he kept calling me "Amy.
...that three-way... I don't know, I don't know.
I think I'm gonna have to......
do we have an I. D. On the blonde?
just now.
I just finished running names off Courtney Evans' incoming calls.
yeah?
we're looking for Suzy Gibbons. - Here it is.
priors for prostitution and a last known.
can I see that?
she knew the vic.
she's the blonde in the bathtub.
well, if we can find Suzy, so can a retired cop. He needs her dead.
if she's dumb enough to hide out in her own house, she already is.
Mike, where are you going?!
daddy said never tell you.
why would Mccarty have a bloody gun with Keppler's prints on it, in his hotel room?
doesn't make any sense.
no.
could mike have touched it when he found it?
no, no way. I was right there.
besides, the blood was already dry.
you don't leave fingerprints in dried blood.
I compared the. 45 ammo evidence to the dead cop and the hooker.
it's the correct make, model and caliber, but I'm telling you, it's a different gun.
maybe he's being set up.
Why? By whom?
Keppler told me that he didn't know Frank Mccarty.
he also said he didn't know the victim.
maybe he's lying about that, too.
I'm sorry, Catherine. I like the guy, too, but I'm just following the evidence here.
we should be talking to Keppler about this.
where is he?
he was with me in a/V.
nobody has seen him since, and he's not answering his cell.
he knows where the eyewitness lives.
what are you saying, Nick?
I'm saying that if he had something to do with these two murders, then Frank Mccarty's not the only one we need to worry about.
PD's on their way to Suzy Gibbons' apartment now.
okay, grab Sara and go over there, and I'll have brass call Trenton pd, see who knows who.
welcome home.
what other evidence did, uh, Keppler handle?
he brought back the three bullets which didn't match the gun with his prints on it.
could he have swapped the bullets?
anything's possible.
he also searched the dumpster where the homeless guy found the hooker's purse and cell phone.
he told Catherine he didn't find anything.
I got your DNA results, and the blood on the gun from Frank Mccarty's hotel room, it doesn't match either victim.
there were no hits in codis, and the DNA print ancestry markers say that it's from a black male.
Keppler and Mccarty were both jersey boys.
expand the search to the east coast.
will do.
I really hope he's clean.
we have to treat him like a suspect.
I'll tell Ecklie.
still no answer on his cell.
Hey.
got a fix on the GPS in his Denali.
he's near Henderson. What's he doing there?
he just disabled his GPS.
smart guy.
guilty guy.
try tracking his cell. Pd-issued phones have GPS, too.
Yeah.
got him.
okay?
I'll take that.
Suzy Gibbons- how do I find her?
okay, you know what? First off, you're gonna get your Freakin' hands off me.
I don't have time, Ricky.
why should I tell you?
because if you don't...
I'm the last face you're gonna see alive.
I don't think suzy works out of here.
me, either.
so I finally got through to the homicide captain in Trenton.
anyway, here's the story.
Keppler not only knew Mccarty.
not only did he know him, he was like a son to him.
Keppler had a close relationship with his daughter, and mccarty was the one who got keppler his job as a csi.
and what about the victim- detective graves?
Yeah, he knew him, too.
graves was being indicted.
seems like too many of his suspects were showing up dead before the trial.
Catherine, I think all three of them are dirty.
okay.
you know, some women...
live out of their purses.
I know a lot of working girls operate out of the siren.
I think we just found her office.
I'll see you back at the lab?
okay.
hello.
it's Mike.
where have you been? Everybody is looking for you.
I know.
I'm sorry.
then come back in.
I can't.
it's kind of complicated.
I... made a mistake a long time ago.
let me help you.
it's too late.
you're gonna end up looking into my cases, Catherine.
they're clean.
I promise, every one of them.
except the Alvarez Homicide in Philly.
if you run the ballistics again, it'll come back to Dennis Graves.
your guys are smart, they'll figure it out.
Mike, don't do anything stupid.
I got to go.
Hey, you've reached Frank. Leave me a message after the tone.
if you still want to fix this, Frank, you got 20 minutes.
blue Siren motel, third, below Fremont.
he just called, sounded desperate.
like a man with nothing to live for and nothing to lose.
well, he's not your priority.
find the witness.
Yeah. I'm on my way. Just wanted you to know.
it's open.
drop it, Frank.
put the gun down.
look, Mike...
about the bar, you were right.
I was out of line.
you know how I get- come on.
put the gun down.
you're not gonna shoot me.
Suzy, I want you to get up and walk out of the room, all right?
I can't let that happen.
sit down.
it's over, Frank.
I know what you did.
what are you talking about?
I know what you did to Amy.
I killed an innocent man.
Mikey, you're talking crazy.
she was your daughter, Frank.
you watch your Frickin' mouth.
all right, okay! Put the gun down.
shut up!
I loved her, Mike, more than you know.
all right, okay.
I'm a dirty cop, rotten to the core.
what do you want from me?
I want you to tell me why, Frank.
why you would do that to your own daughter.
come on, Mike.
you're all I've got.
No! No!
Mike. Mike, hang in there.
call the paramedics.
dispatch, got a code 44.
you're gonna be okay. Just stay with me.
I'm sorry.
I just know they both had guns.
move it. Pupils still fixed and dilated.
he's moving into v-fib! Let's go!
stay with me, mike. - Place him into the back of the rig.
let's go, let's go. - Hang on, Mike.
charging, 300. - two placement's good.
clear.
no response. Hitting him again.
copy. Clear.
Yeah, I've got nothing.
still in v-fib. Come on, come on.
no pulse.
what?
he's gone.
talk to me, Archie.
the signal's 20 yards north of your position.
I don't see anything.
I'm dialing the phone now.
all right.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I got something.
I'll call you back.
Keppler left his phone so we'd find the hand.
check under the nails. You'll find Frank Mccarty's DNA.
Thanks.
so, you've been pulling a lot of doubles this week.
Yeah, it's about all I do.
have you been in touch with Sara?
we've talked a little.
so where's she at?
San Francisco. Visiting her mother.
no, I mean-- that's nice.
no, but I meant where's she at emotionally?
you know, with respect to the two of you.
I can't speak for her.
so speak for yourself.
I can't talk, I'm really busy.
so Archie's in the Garage, he's documenting evidence from a drug bust, he picks up a thing of coke, and then it blows up in his face?
no. He picks up a cellophane and duct-tape-wrapped kilo of coke, and the third one from the top of the stack blows up in his face. Oh.
it's important to be specific.
okay, well, this game is not as much fun as I thought it was going to be-- It's not a game, it's a thought experiment.
if you want to be a good criminalist.
I am a good criminalist.
if you want to be a better criminalist, then you have to learn to train to-- Learn to think like a criminal. I know.
look, I'm sure Grissom's told you...
well, maybe not you, but he's told me many times:
that we speak for the dead.
think of this exercise as a way for the dead to speak for themselves.
SIMMS: But that's not actually what this is.
HODGES: It's a chance for you to be a CSI.
the only thing you need to do is answer two simple questions.
HODGES: After HazMat cleans up the scene...
the coroner does his thing...
no sign of sexual trauma.
SIMMS: What?
HODGES: I believe he's legally required to check.
I can't believe Archie's gone.
he was too good for this world.
what?
they would be very upset.
can we at least stipulate that they heroically contain their bereavement?
Yes, I suppose Archie could live with that.
so to speak.
thank you.
Mm-hmm.
HODGES: What the CSIs realize is...
it's gotta be the dealer.
Yeah, he booby-trapped the stash so if the cops got the drugs...
then they would get the boom along with it? Right?
just let me nish the setup, okay? Sorry.
HODGES: What the CSIs finally realize is...
SIMMS: They sorted everything already? That was quick.
HODGES: Can you just let me finish!
according to this, 20 bricks of coke were logged into evidence just past midnight.
the explosion occurred about a half an hour later.
but there are 21 wrappers here.
and since no one entered or exited the Lab during that time frame, it means the explosive was planted in the suitcase here.
which means...
the killer is someone in the Lab.
well, if the killer is someone who works in the Lab, then he could just tamper with the evidence.
which means that there's really no way for me to solve this thing, this a trick question.
no, no, no, that's not what I want...
my shoelace is untied.
excuse me. Okay.
okay, um...
wouldn't, how about this.
since it would be pretty risky for the killer to tamper with evidence during a full-on investigation in the Lab... Mm-hmm.
let's just say, for the purposes of this exercise, that can't happen.
okay.
now what?
that's up to you.
you have the setup.
you run the investigation from here.
simple Q & A. You ask, I answer.
truthfully?
Absolutely.
no lying-- call that a rule.
well, what if I get close to actually figuring it out, you're not just gonna change who did it or something like that?
no revisionism-- also a rule.
for something that's not a game it sure does have a lot of rules.
you want to do this or not?
all right.
okay.
I guess the first thing that I would do would be to examine the actual bomb mechanism to see if there's any clue as to who might have built it.
good idea.
because there are a lot of clues.
chemicals have been sent to Trace for I. D. But the bomb appears to be a binary explosive.
killer hides the loaded brick amongst the others...
a little pressure arms it...
liquid "A" in ampoule mixes solid "B," creating an unstable chemical explosive...
all you need to do is move it.
Ooh, I have an idea.
HODGES: What?
SIMMS: What about the blasting cap?
HODGES: Ah, well, what do you know?
the leg wires are color coded.
SIMMS: Good, 'cause the color coding is manufacturer specific.
so now we can track down the source.
indeed we could.
Hey, people. What's going on?
nothing.
you look... better.
let's say you learn that LVPD recently seized one dozen commercial grade blasting caps in an arson-explosives raid, and that the Lab was processing the case evidence.
well, then, I know exactly where I'd go next...
course I know where those blasting caps are.
they're right in here.
SIMMS: No, no, no, no, no.
not so fast, cowboy.
give me those keys.
looks like you're one blasting cap shy, Bob.
that's not possible.
wait...
y'all don't think I had something to do with...
are there any prints on the lock?
excuse me, we're.
playing a murder game.
I know, I get it.
I wanna play.
he says it's not a game.
well, I wanna play anyway.
no. Why not?
you're the dead guy.
Oh.
well, then I'd have a vested interest in the outcome then, wouldn't I?
Oh, come on, I'll fill him in as we go along.
fine.
Yup. So.
are there any prints on the lock?
HODGES: No, no prints.
looks like this lock's been slipped.
so somebody stole the blolting cap from Ballists to make it look like Bobby did it.
nefarious, don't you think?
what about the chemicals that were used to make the explosive?
did we get anything back from Trace?
you always get something from Trace.
the explosive was liquid nitro-acetate and solid ammonium nitrate packed in baking soda.
to blend in with the rest of the cocaine bricks.
cute.
explosive liquids are generally pretty volatile.
did you ask Hodges if nitro-acetate has any special storage requirements?
HODGES: It needs to be refrigerated.
Yeah, he said it needed to be refrigerated.
well, there's only so many refrigerators in the Lab.
maybe "where" can get us to "who."
what are you guys looking for?
I'm sorry, we can't tell you that, Henry.
nitrogen tetra-hydride...
sodium nitrate.
wait, what happens when you mix those two compounds?
they produce nitro-acetate.
that's a high explosive binary, Henry.
Really?
I didn't know that.
look, just 'cause I have those compounds in my fridge doesn't mean I used them to make nitro-acetate.
you can't prove that.
baking soda was used to conceal the explosive, smartass.
it's also used to absorb odors.
nice smell is a priority of my life.
I think the baking soda was used to absorb a lot more than odors, Henry.
okay, I confess, I did it!
why would Henry kill me?
we're not supposed to care about the why.
whatever.
Hey, fellas. Hey.
thanks for giving me justice at least.
Yeah, you're welcome.
man, I don't know if I'm more tired or hungry right now.
you wanna get something to eat? -Yeah.
actually, I felt like a little Pai Gow or some Blackjack.
let's hit the Strip.
after the shift we just pulled? -Yeah.
I just drank one of those energy drinks.
I probably w't sleep for another couple hours.
I don't think so, man.
maybe another time, huh?
all right.
I'll catch ya later.
all right, Grissom G.That's it for me. I'm out of here.
Yeah, I'm going over to Frank's to grab something to eat.
I'll probably be there for at least an hour if you want to... if you want to join me.
you know, we don't have to talk about anything in particular.
just two guys having breakfast.
I just don't think it's good for people to be alone too much.
if you want to, cool. If not, cool.
whatever.
Hi.
rack 'em up.
excuse me?
well, word on campus is, there's a murder game going on.
Oh, no, no, no, it's not a game.
it's a thought experiment.
sounds like the late Archie Johnson has a big mouth.
come on, please, it's been really slow at Prints all day.
who we killin'?
Henry, I need the tox on that lady, um...
no sign of sexual trauma.
thank God for small favors.
you know, David, our job is never easy, but this is a colleague.
if your emotions are too raw and you feel you need to excuse yourself...
look.
he's crunchy.
um...
frozen sweat stains. Yuck.
he was trapped in a small space at minus ten degrees centigrade.
so it's fair to assume he was exerting himself in a state of mind-numbing terror.
how long do you think he was stuck in there?
well, several hours at least.
time of exposure in extreme cold is difficult to gauge physiologically.
why don't you let me know when he softens up and we'll start cutting.
so we're just going to wait for him to thaw?
what do you want me to do, stick him in a microwave?
Ooh...
hot... hot, hot, hot.
so, then, okay, Henry froze to death.
well, maybe not.
because if the autopsy hasn't been performed yet, then we can't be sure that's COD.
well played, Simms.
so it takes a few turns for the autopsy results to get back. Turns?
hours. A few hours.
so, while you're waiting for the autopsy results, what do you do in the meantime?
well, the CSIs would process the freezer.
did they find anything?
a virtual cornucopia.
the condition of the interior could be the result of a struggle, or the simple, understandable panic of a man trapped inside a freezer.
in any event, the emergency release handle appears to have been bent and rendered inoperative, and several chemical containers broken in the process possibly releasing chloroform and methyl ethyl ketone into the space.
I'm sending samples to Trace to confirm.
trace.
is there anything you can't do?
sorry.
this could be a case of lab geek humor gone wrong.
Hello!
Hello?! It's not funny!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, help!
help me!
please help!
so the merry prankster comes back later, sees the joke gone bad, then he just yanks the pin and scrams.
you said that the emergency release plunger was bent.
Mm-hmm.
well, that thing is made of solid steel.
how could Henry do that?
adrenaline kicks in when he finally realizes that he's dying.
so, maybe in the moment of crisis,
Henry has the strength of ten men.
ten small men.
maybe.
that word always looks so good on a case report.
was there any evidence on the handle on the outside of the freezer?
just a schmear.
sugar, soy protein, partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, roasted nuts.
peanut butter?
WEBSTER: Well, killer's got to eat, too.
SIMMS: So, CSIs would check every trash can and every bio hazard disposal unit in the whole Lab.
HODGES: Yes, the would, and they would find...
what, no jelly?
we found the peanut butter from inside your glove.
it matches the stuff we found on the freezer door handle.
chunky, right?
I didn't kill Henry.
well, not on purpose.
no, not even by accident.
I only had a couple of minutes for lunch, and I had a bu that needed to be stored.
and I store them in the freezer.
you seem very tense.
you know, I don't really like being persecuted.
Yeah.
get used to it, punk.
no, I don't know about that.
what? Well, Bobby's a gun guy.
gun guys shoot people.
gun guys don't shoot people.
people shoot people.
actually, bullets shoot people, shot from guns which are usually in the hands of gun guys.
can we get the autopsy results?
well, I guess Henry's had enough time to defrost.
cod was not, in fact, due to hypothermia.
Ooh, wait, no, I can guess what they found in Tox.
it was chloroform.
Nope.
methyl ethyl ether?
PCP.
what?
massive, overdose amounts of PCP.
commonly known as phencyclidine, or angel dust.
PCP blocks the brain's NMDA receptors, hypothalamus goes nuts, resulting in anxiety, confusion, and fever-like overheating.
WEBSTER: So Henry goes into the cooler to cool off...
SIMMS: And with the PCP stimulating his adrenal glands, he has the strength of the Incredible Hulk.
andrews: A duster?
you made me a lousy duster?
that is totally bogus.
other reasons why I'd be crazy to even try that junk, if I were a closet PCP freak, I wouldn't do it in the Lab.
that's very professional.
Archie told me about your sick little thought experiment and I want to play.
but I still can't believe, even hypothetically, you'd do something like this to me.
well, Henry, I hypothetically called your mother and I explained everything.
that woman is a crier.
your autopsy didn't mention powder in his nasal passages or PCP damage in his lungs.
that's because it wasn't there.
so Henry didn't inhale it, or smoke it, or snort it?
no, he didn't.
then how did the PCP get into my system?
you tell me.
Oh!
crusty pits.
sweat stains.
you said that Henry's lab coat had big sweat stains on the collar and on the armpits.
so that's it somebody dosed the coat.
lab coat tests positive for PCP.
like a nicotine patch from hell.
well, Henry would've died of an overdose no matter what.
so, all the trapping him in the freezer with the chemicals spilling, that was all completely incidental.
it was the logical outcome of the initial crime.
and it's quite funny.
Hey.
well, we're not done yet.
who did the deed?
well, taking lab coats off the premises is against regulations.
so the PCP would've had to have been applied in the Lab, right under our noses.
and that stuff reeks.
I have to crank my fume hood up full whenever I work with it, I still go home with a headache.
fume hoods. There's fume hoods in the Garage, and DNA and Trace.
so we would have to test all the sinks for PCP.
HODGES: Excellent.
that's a good approach.
HODGES: But you would find nothing.
SIMMS: Really?
Yeah, there's no trace of PCP in any of sinks.
squeaky clean.
damn it.
Oh! Wait.
I got it, check the plant.
HODGES: You got it.
the killer cleaned up, but he left one witness.
me?
Oh, drat.
well, it's not a slow day for me after all.
Ecklie wants me to pick up the backlog from Swing.
somebody please tell me who dies next.
and how. Thank you.
so...
you got time for one more?
well, someone's having fun.
maybe a little.
you're not bad at this.
SIMMS: Thanks.
I've been thinking about taking the CSI field test.
this is actually really good theory and practice for me.
what?
Why?
nothing.
nothing?
that's right.
a great big pile of nothing.
from me, to you.
Oh, hey.
how are you?
Why?
I can't ask how you're doing?
I'm sorry.
I've just had a lot of, uh...
I've been busy.
Oh.
well, maybe you should take a few days off, for once in your career.
I mean, you've got enough stored up.
go after her.
it's not what she wants.
what do you want?
I want her to be happy.
field Agent Simms.
stop it.
Hey, I think it's got a nice ring to it. Thank you.
here she comes, flashing her badge, taking down perps.
why is even potential advancement so threatening to you?
Hey, Sanders left the lab, he got his ass kicked.
I'm just saying.
all right, come on, let's do another one.
okay. Fine.
let's.
SIMMS: Well, now, that's a little passive-aggressive,
no kidding.
it appears as though the vic struck the edge of the table.
the evidence on the floor is...
well, evidence.
brown paper bindle must have opened when it fell.
looks like the contents of a woman's purse.
SIMMS: Square toe, low heel, stylish but affordable.
flirty, not whory.
you will be missed.
there's an oily residue on the sole.
sanders: The evidence appears to lead to an inescapable conclusion.
this tragedy might have just simply been the result of an accident in the workplace.
SIMMS: I fell off a ladder?
well, you are kind of little clumsy.
since when?
it's endearing.
HODGES: Are you satisfied with the explanation?
SIMMS: Uh, no.
what about the oily residue on the ladder?
there are bristles in the oil, which means that somebody brushed it on.
andrews: What exactly is the oily stuff?
well, thank God...
...for trace analysis.
hmm.
Hodges, who is a genius and tragically underpaid, used the powers of his brilliant mind and the scientific method to discover that the oil that was brushed on the ladder was a Teflon-based two-part oil.
a gun lubricant.
so?
so you're the gun guy, Bobby.
Yeah, which is exactly why I would never use Teflon-based two-part oil.
real gun guys hate that stuff.
if it separates in the can, it separates in the gun.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
whoa. You are tense.
so, where do you think you're going?
back to work.
this is ridiculous. Oh.
sit down.
no, no. Captain Brass is not the kind of cop who smacks a suspect around.
Really? Scares me.
Oh, well, look who's the clumsy one now.
excuse me.
okay, so we don't have nearly enough to hold Bobby, right?
no.
all right.
who's up for an autopsy?
robbins: The carotid-jugular complex was transected, and based on the placement and size of the wound, I'd say she had at...
Hey, it's a neck wound.
based on the placement and size of the neck wound, she was conscious 30 to 60 seconds before blood loss was fatal.
that's a long time.
no one reported her screaming or calling out for help.
we have to get back to the case file.
there was no blood on her hands at the scene.
unless she was unconscious, she would have at least tried to stop the bleeding.
well, there was no blow to the head.
do you think it's possible she was dead before she hit the table?
you mean like a cardiac event?
I can't rule that out, but a healthy, 36-year-old having a heart attack?
SIMMS: 35 in October, thank you very much.
she has a oval, perimortem burn on her wrist.
wait a second. That's familiar.
singed right off her barely 35-year-old wrist.
that bracelet wasn't old evidence.
I was wearing it.
correct.
so, what melts silver and stops your heart at the same time?
a bolt of lightning.
in the lab?
electrocution.
from what?
something in the Evidence Locker.
SIMMS: There was a motorcycle battery in the ventilation duct?
andrews: Wired to the ladder and the evidence box?
HODGES: Precisely.
devilishly clever, wouldn't you say?
no.
well, who's the killer, Wile E. Coyote?
what do you mean? ANDREWS: It's ridiculous!
anyone could have walked in there.
so, what, the victim's just random?
uh, no.
how'd the killer get me up there in the first place?
what did he do, pass me in the hall and say, "Hey, Wendy, go climb up that ladder and check out the case evidence you had absolutely nothing to do with?"
not in those words exactly, but, uh, yeah.
that's completely unverifiable.
this is so lame.
scenario requires further revision.
okay, what is that?
nothing.
is that a tape recorder?
you are so paranoid.
this thought experiment has now concluded. Thank you.
why were you recording us?
why would I record you? That makes no sense.
the Game of Science and Murder.
it's a prototype.
two to four players, ages eight and up.
you're making a board game?
well, it's not just a board game.
gets people to think.
why were you recording us?
I needed your help to flesh out scenarios, and I figured that if I hid the recorder, your answers would be candid and honest.
look, see.
it's like Clue, only CSI-ier.
Hodges, this is, uh...
this is kind of impressive.
in a painfully sad, geek type of way.
well, painfully sad geeks have a lot of spare time on their hands ???
lab Rats could be a gold mine.
Oh!
little Lab Techs.
Mm-hmm.
sandy Baxter, fingerprint fanatic.
eagled-eyed A/V expert.
andrew Henries, top-notch tox tech.
Mm-hmm.
you named yourself after cancer.
Oh!
the clumsy yet buxom DNA tech.
clumsy yet buxom?
it's a redeeming feature.
it's-it's a prototype.
so, tell me, do you think that Mindy Bimms is clumsy because she's top-heavy?
or do you just mean clumsy like this?
okay, are you... are you allergic to being honest with me?
cause the thing is, if you had actually asked me to help you with this game, I would have.
but, no, you had to hide a tape recorder under a table and engage us all in this great big thought experiment!
when in reality, it doesn't even matter, apparently, what I think because I'm just Mindy Big Boobs to you, and I...
you are the dumbest smart guy I know.
you think I'm smart?
night, Greg.
Yeah, whatever.
HODGES: Oh, Hodges, I'm so sorry.
it's just that I'm jealous of your intellect.
but Wendy, you have so much to live for.
don't do it. You're too close to the edge.
Oh, and now I'm drowning! Oh, God!
Oh, God, help me.
help me.
what are you doing?
Oh, uh...
I was, uh, just trying to... develop a board game based on this place, but not in any legally actionable sense.
you get evidence, scenarios, analysis.
try to solve diabolical murders.
I like games.
Really?
Yeah.
okay. Let's play.
what makes it hard to catch a killer?
is it the sheer destructive power of the murder itself that obliterates evidence as it snuffs out life?
or is it the chain of events the murder sets into motion which obscure the true crime?
that was good.
or is it a mechanism so complexand diabolical that it borders on the incredible?
in truth, it is all these things, and all these things are the same.
because the only real way to catch a killer, is to outsmart him.
and hope that he's not smarter than you.
no witnesses.
nobody heard the shot, and the killer is somebody in the Lab.
am I eligible?
in this scenario, no.
okay.
so during the basic process of the scene, what do I find?
HODGES: A single nine millimeter casing at the doorway to Trace.
then my first blush theory is a walk-by.
I'm going to need the bullet.
then I'm going to need an autopsy.
get it out of your system. No sign of sexual trauma.
out! Now. All right, trajectory of the shot was roughly 90 degrees from vertical, straight through his noble skull.
bullet didn't exit.
grissom: Is it intact?
more or less.
HODGES: The bullet's nose is significantly deformed and the lead base is pitted.
but there are sufficient striae to get a match for what little it's worth.
the gun came through the lab about a week ago in a buyback program, and was subsequently destroyed.
so you were shot by a weapon that no longer exists.
apparently.
okay, let's go over your snuff film, shall we?
I want to see exactly what you did.
in truth, it is all of these things, and all of these things are the same.
because the only real way to catch a killer, is to outsmart him and hope that he is not smarter than you.
do it again. Do it again.
one more time. One more time.
wait, wait, wait-- they all want to watch?
professional curiosity.
I guess.
in truth, it is all these things, and all these things are the same.
because the only real way to catch a killer, is to outsmart him and hope that he is not smarter than you.
grissom: You took the shot straight into your head, but according to the video, you were not facing the hallway.
which means the bullet didn't come from there.
it must've come from here.
HODGES: Yes, it did.
a zip gun.
HODGES: With an unrifled barrel.
and a remote trigger.
so no call-back numbers.
pre-1990 pagers didn't store them.
HODGES: So, you're at a dead end?
I'm just getting started.
do I have to walk over to the GCMS or will you just tell me?
the barrel of the zip gun contains traces of black powder.
okay, but the bullet was pitted on the base, which is the result of exposure to smokeless gunpowder.
which means that the bullet that killed you was fired twice.
grissom: The killer test fires the gun, knowing it will be destroyed, VK and keeps the bullet and the casing.
he puts the bullet in a metal tube on a wad of black powder.
with a pager trigger, it's essentially a remote controlled musket.
call the number from any phone or through the internet and...
impressive.
well, Bobby Dawson is an early 19th century firearm enthusiast.
Oh, yeah.
big gun guy.
I didn't do it!
I swear!
Hey!
gun.
what do you got against Bobby Dawson?
nothing.
running gag.
so, you think Bobby Dawson did it?
no.
Bobby was framed.
you drew me a map.
the path of the bullet, if not stopped by your brain mass, would have continued straight through into ballistics.
where Bobby works.
now, Bobby's a real gun guy, and no gun guy would ever position himself down-range of a shot.
you're more than a victim, Hodges.
according to your video, you straightened up just before the fatal shot was fired.
you knew it was coming.
and you made sure that you were in the perfect position to catch it.
I am a mere Padawan in the presence of the Jedi Master.
true.
let's play another.
sure.
you weren't ready.
to leave.
this.
the challenges, the puzzles, the job.
no.
but Sara was.
Yeah, she was.
you can't stand in the way of that.
when it's time for someone to move on, you just gotta let them go.
let's play the game, shall we?
okay.
mind if I record this?
scenario 12, Hodges and Grissom.
okay, you walk into the AV lab.
you find Archie slumped over his computer with a knife in his head...
Ecklie's been on me to finish the monthly stats, so I need a list of all the lab call-outs from dispatch as soon as you can.
you'll have it by the end of shift tomorrow.
Thanks.
so, you've been pulling a lot of doubles this week.
Yeah, it's about all I do.
have you been in touch with Sara?
we've talked a little.
so where's she at?
San Francisco. Visiting her mother.
no, I mean - - that's nice.
no, but I meant where's she at emotionally?
you know, with respect to the two of you.
I can't speak for her.
so speak for yourself.
I can't talk, I'm really busy.
so Archie's in the garage, he's documenting evidence from a drug bust, he picks up a thing of coke, and then it blows up in his face?
no. He picks up a cellophane and duct-tape-wrapped kilo of coke, and the third one from the top of the stack blows up in his face.
it's important to be specific.
okay, well, this game is not as much fun as I thought it was going to be -
it's not a game, it's a thought experiment.
if you want to be a good criminalist -
I am a good criminalist.
if you want to be a better criminalist, then you have to learn to train to -
learn to think like a criminal.
I know.
look, I'm sure Grissom's told you ...
well, maybe not you, but he's told me many times:
that we speak for the dead.
think of this exercise as a way for the dead to speak for themselves.
but that's not actually what this is -
it's a chance for you to be a CSI.
the only thing you need to do is answer two simple questions.
who did it and how?
after hazmat cleans up the scene ...
the coroner does his thing ...
no sign of sexual trauma.
what?
I believe he's legally required to check.
what the CSIS realize is
I can't believe Archie's gone.
he was too good for this world.
what?
they would be very upset.
can we at least stipulate that they heroically contain their bereavement?
Yes, I suppose Archie could live with that.
so to speak.
thank you.
what the CSIS realize is ...
it's gotta be the dealer.
Yeah, he Booby-trapped the stash so if the cops got the drugs ...
then they would get the boom along with it?
right? Am I right? - No, you're wrong.
just let me finish the setup, okay?
sorry.
what the CSIS finally realize is...
they sorted everything already? That was quick.
can you just let me finish!
according to this, 20 bricks of coke were logged into evidence just past midnight.
the explosion occurred about a half an hour later.
but there are 21 wrappers here.
and since no one entered or exited the lab during that time frame, it means the explosive was planted in the suitcase here.
which means ...
the killer is someone in the lab.
well, if the killer is someone who works in the lab, then he could just tamper with the evidence.
which means that there's really no way for me to solve this thing, this a trick question.
no, no, no, that's not what I want ...
my shoelace is untied. Excuse me.
okay.
okay, um ... wouldn't, how about this.
since it would be pretty risky for the killer to tamper with evidence during a full-on investigation in the lab ...
let's just say, for the purposes of this exercise, that can't happen.
okay.
now what?
that's up to you.
you have the setup.
you run the investigation from here.
simple Q & A. You ask, I answer.
truthfully? - Absolutely.
no lying - - call that a rule.
well, what if I get close to actually figuring it out, you're not just gonna change who did it or something like that?
no revisionism - - also a rule.
for something that's not a game it sure does have a lot of rules.
you want to do this or not?
all right.
okay. I guess the first thing that I would do would be to examine the actual bomb mechanism to see if there's any clue as to who might have built it.
good idea.
because there are a lot of clues.
chemicals have been sent to trace for I. D.
but the bomb appears to be a binary explosive.
killer hides the loaded brick amongst the others ...
a little pressure arms it ...
liquid "a" in ampoule mixes with solid "b," creating an unstable chemical explosive ...
all you need to do is move it.
Ooh, I have an idea.
what?
what about the blasting cap?
Ah, well, what do you know?
the leg wires are color coded.
good, cause the color coding is manufacturer specific.
so now we can track down the source.
indeed we could.
Hey, people.
what's going on?
nothing.
you look ... better.
let's say you learn that LVPD recently seized one dozen commercial grade blasting caps in an arson-explosives raid, and that the lab was processing the case evidence.
well, then, I know exactly where I'd go next ...
of course I know where those blasting caps are.
they're right in here.
no, no, no, no, no.
not so fast, cowboy.
give me those keys.
looks like you're one blasting cap shy, Bob.
that's not possible.
wait ... you all don't think I had something to do with ...
are there any prints on the lock?
excuse me, we're
playing a murder game. I know, I get it.
I wanna play.
he says it's not a game.
well, I wanna play anyway.
no.
why not?
you're the dead guy.
well, then I'd have a vested interest in the outcome then, wouldn't I?
Oh, come on, I'll fill him in as we go along.
fine.
so. Are there any prints on the lock?
no, no prints. Just metal shavings.
looks like this lock's been slipped.
so somebody stole the blasting cap from ballistics to make it look like Bobby did it.
nefarious, don't you think?
what about the chemicals that were used to make the explosive?
did we get anything back from trace?
you always get something from trace.
the explosive was liquid nitro-acetate and solid ammonium nitrate packed in baking soda.
to blend in with the rest of the cocaine bricks. Cute.
explosive liquids are generally pretty volatile.
did you ask Hodges if nitro-acetate has any special storage requirements?
it needs to be refrigerated.
Yeah, he said it needed to be refrigerated.
well, there's only so many refrigerators in the lab.
maybe "where" can get us to "who."
what are you guys looking for?
I'm sorry, we can't tell you that, Henry.
nitrogen tetra-hydride ...
sodium nitrate.
wait, what happens when you mix those two compounds?
they produce nitro-acetate.
that's a high explosive binary, Henry.
Really?
I didn't know that.
look, just cause I have those compounds in my fridge doesn't mean I used them to make nitro-acetate.
you can't prove that.
baking soda was used to conceal the explosive, smart ass.
it's also used to absorb odors.
nice smell is a priority of my life.
I think the baking soda was used to absorb a lot more than odors, Henry.
okay, I confess, I did it!
why would Henry kill me?
we're not supposed to care about the why.
whatever.
Hey, fellas. - Hey.
thanks for giving me justice at least.
Yeah, you're welcome.
man, I don't know if I'm more tired or hungry right now.
you wanna get something to eat?
Yeah.
actually, I felt like a little Pai Gow or some blackjack.
let's hit the strip.
after the shift we just pulled?
Yeah.
I just drank one of those energy drinks.
I probably won't sleep for another couple hours.
I don't think so, man.
maybe another time, huh?
all right.
I'll catch ya later.
all right, Grissom.
that's it for me. I'm out of here.
have a nice day.
Yeah, I'm going over to Frank's to grab something to eat.
I'll probably be there for at least an hour if you want to ...
if you want to join me.
you know, we don't have to talk about anything in particular.
just two guys having breakfast.
I just don't think it's good for people to be alone too much.
if you want to, cool. If not, cool. Whatever.
rack 'em up.
excuse me?
well, word on campus is, there's a murder game going on.
Oh, no, no, no, it's not a game.
it's a thought experiment.
sounds like the late Archie Johnson has a big mouth.
come on, please, it's been really slow at prints all day.
who we killin'?
Henry, I need the tox on that lady, um...
no sign of sexual trauma.
thank god for small favors.
you know, David, our job is never easy, but this is a colleague.
if your emotions are too raw and you feel you need to excuse yourself...
look.
he's crunchy.
frozen sweat stains. Yuck.
he was trapped in a small space at minus ten degrees centigrade.
so it's fair to assume he was exerting himself in a state of mind-numbing terror.
how long do you think he was stuck in there?
well, several hours at least.
time of exposure in extreme cold is difficult to gauge physiologically.
why don't you let me know when he softens up and we'll start cutting.
so we're just going to wait for him to thaw?
what do you want me to do, stick him in a microwave?
so, then, okay, Henry froze to death.
well, maybe not.
because if the autopsy hasn't been performed yet, then we can't be sure that's cod.
well played, Simms.
so it takes a few turns for the autopsy results to get back.
turns?
hours. A few hours.
so, while you're waiting for the autopsy results, what do you do in the meantime?
well, the CSIS would process the freezer.
did they find anything?
a virtual cornucopia.
the condition of the interior could be the result of a struggle, or the simple, understandable panic of a man trapped inside a freezer.
in any event, the emergency release handle appears to have been bent and rendered inoperative, and several chemical containers broken in the process possibly releasing chloroform and methyl ethyl ketone into the space.
I'm sending samples to trace to confirm.
trace.
is there anything you can't do?
sorry.
this could be a case of lab geek humor gone wrong.
Hello?
Hello!
Hello?! It's not funny!
come on, oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, help!
help me!
please help!
so the merry prankster comes back later, sees the joke gone bad, then he just yanks the pin and scrams.
you said that the emergency release plunger was bent.
well, that thing is made of solid steel.
how could Henry do that?
adrenaline kicks in when he finally realizes that he's dying.
so, maybe in the moment of crisis, Henry has the strength of ten men.
ten small men.
"maybe." That word always looks so good on a case report.
was there any evidence on the handle on the outside of the freezer?
just a schmear.
sugar, soy protein, partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, roasted nuts.
peanut butter?
well, killer's got to eat, too.
so, CSIS would check every trash can and every bio hazard disposal unit in the whole lab.
Yes, they would, and they would find ...
what, no jelly?
we found the peanut butter from inside your glove.
it matches the stuff we found on the freezer door handle.
chunky, right?
I didn't kill Henry.
well, not on purpose.
no, not even by accident.
I only had a couple of minutes for lunch, and I had a bunch of photo emulsion sheets that needed to be stored.
and I store them in the freezer.
you seem very tense.
you know, I don't really like being persecuted.
Yeah.
get used to it, punk.
no, I don't know about that.
what?
well, Bobby's a gun guy.
gun guys shoot people.
gun guys don't shoot people. People shoot people.
actually, bullets shoot people, shot from guns which are usually in the hands of gun guys.
can we get the autopsy results?
well, I guess Henry's had enough time to defrost.
cod was not, in fact, due to hypothermia.
Ooh, wait, no, I can guess what they found in tox.
it was chloroform.
Nope.
methyl ethyl ether?
PCP.
what?
massive, overdose amounts of PCP.
commonly known as phencyclidine, or angel dust.
PCP blocks the brain's NMDA receptors, hypothalamus goes nuts, resulting in anxiety, confusion, and fever-like overheating.
so Henry goes into the cooler to cool off ...
and with the PCP stimulating his adrenal glands, he has the strength of the incredible hulk.
a duster?
you made me a lousy duster?
that is totally bogus.
aside from the 10, 000 other reasons why I'd be crazy to even try that junk, if I were a closet PCP freak, I wouldn't do it in the lab.
that's very professional.
Archie told me about your sick little thought experiment, and I want to play.
but I still can't believe, even hypothetically, you'd do something like this to me.
well, Henry, I hypothetically called your mother and I explained everything.
that woman is a crier.
your autopsy didn't mention powder in his nasal passages or PCP damage in his lungs.
that's because it wasn't there.
so Henry didn't inhale it, or smoke it, or snort it?
no, he didn't.
then how did the PCP get into my system?
you tell me.
Oh! Crusty pits.
sweat stains.
you said that Henry's lab coat had big sweat stains on the collar and on the armpits.
so that's it - - somebody dosed the coat.
lab coat tests positive for PCP.
combined with body heat and sweat, the drug must've entered his system transdermally.
like a nicotine patch from hell.
well, Henry would've died of an overdose no matter what.
so, all the trapping him in the freezer with the chemicals spilling, that was all completely incidental.
it was the logical outcome of the initial crime.
and it's quite funny.
Hey.
well, we're not done yet.
who did the deed?
well, taking lab coats off the premises is against regulations.
so the PCP would've had to have been applied in the lab, right under our noses.
and that stuff reeks.
I have to crank my fume hood up full whenever I work with it,
I still go home with a headache.
fume hoods.
there's fume hoods in the garage, and DNA and trace.
so we would have to test all the sinks for PCP.
excellent.
that's a good approach.
it's well considered, and thoughtful
but you would find nothing.
Really?
Yeah, there's no trace of PCP in any of sinks.
squeaky clean.
damn it.
Oh! Wait.
I got it, check the plant.
you got it.
the killer cleaned up, but he left one witness.
me?
Oh, drat.
well, it's not a slow day for me after all.
Ecklie wants me to pick up the backlog from swing.
somebody please tell me who dies next.
and how. Thank you.
so ... you got time for one more?
well, someone's having fun.
maybe a little.
you're not bad at this.
Thanks.
I've been thinking about taking the CSI field test.
this is actually really good theory and practice for me.
the field test?
Yeah.
what? Why? - Nothing.
nothing? - That's right.
a great big pile of nothing. From me, to you.
Oh, hey.
how are you?
Why?
I can't ask how you're doing?
I'm sorry.
I've just had a lot of, uh ...
I've been busy.
Oh. Well, maybe you should take a few days off, for once in your career.
I mean, you've got enough stored up.
go after her.
it's not what she wants.
what do you want?
I want her to be happy.
field agent Simms. - Stop it.
Hey, I think it's got a nice ring to it. - Thank you.
here she comes, flashing her badge, taking down perps.
why is even potential advancement so threatening to you?
Hey, Sanders left the lab, he got his ass kicked.
I'm just saying.
all right, come on, let's do another one.
okay. Fine.
let's.
well, now, that's a little passive-aggressive, don't you think?
no kidding.
it appears as though the victim struck the edge of the table.
the evidence on the floor is ... well, evidence.
brown paper bindle must have opened when it fell.
looks like the contents of a woman's purse.
and here's the victim's other shoe.
square toe, low heel, stylish but affordable.
flirty, not whory.
you will be missed.
there's an oily residue on the sole.
the evidence appears to lead to an inescapable conclusion.
this tragedy might have just simply been the result of an accident in the workplace.
I fell off a ladder?
well, you are kind of little clumsy.
since when?
it's endearing.
are you satisfied with the explanation?
uh, no.
what about the oily residue on the ladder?
there are bristles in the oil, which means that somebody brushed it on.
what exactly is the oily stuff?
well, thank god ...
for trace analysis.
Hodges, who is a genius and tragically underpaid, used the powers of his brilliant mind and the scientific method to discover that the oil that was brushed on the ladder was a teflon-based two-part oil.
a gun lubricant.
so?
so you're the gun guy, Bobby.
Yeah, which is exactly why I would never use teflon-based two-part oil.
real gun guys hate that stuff.
if it separates in the can, it separates in the gun.
you are tense.
so, where do you think you're going?
back to work. This is ridiculous.
sit down.
no, no.
captain Brass is not the kind of cop who smacks a suspect around.
Really? Scares me.
Oh, well, look who's the clumsy one now.
excuse me.
okay, so we don't have nearly enough to hold Bobby, right?
no.
all right.
who's up for an autopsy?
the carotid-jugular complex was transected, and based on the placement and size of the wound,
I'd say she had at ...
Hey, it's a neck wound.
based on the placement and size of the neck wound, she was conscious 30 to 60 seconds before blood loss was fatal.
that's a long time.
no one reported her screaming or calling out for help.
we have to get back to the case file.
there was no blood on her hands at the scene.
unless she was unconscious, she would have at least tried to stop the bleeding.
well, there was no blow to the head.
do you think it's possible she was dead before she hit the table?
you mean like a cardiac event?
I can't rule that out, but a healthy, 36-year-old having a heart attack?
35 in October, thank you very much.
she has a oval, perimortem burn on her wrist.
wait a second. That's familiar.
singed right off her barely 35-year-old wrist.
that bracelet wasn't old evidence.
I was wearing it.
correct.
so, what melts silver and stops your heart at the same time?
a bolt of lightning.
in the lab.
electrocution.
from what?
something in the evidence locker.
there was a motorcycle battery in the ventilation duct?
wired to the ladder and the evidence box?
precisely.
devilishly clever, wouldn't you say?
no.
well, who's the killer, Wile E. Coyote?
what do you mean?
it's ridiculous!
anyone could have walked in there.
so, what, the victim's just random?
uh, no.
how'd the killer get me up there in the first place?
what did he do, pass me in the hall and say, "hey, Wendy, go climb up that ladder."
and check out the case evidence you had absolutely nothing to do with?
not in those words exactly, but, uh, yeah.
that's completely unverifiable.
this is so lame.
scenario requires further revision.
okay, what is that?
nothing.
is that a tape recorder?
you are so paranoid.
this thought experiment has now concluded.
thank you.
why were you recording us?
I wasn't recording you.
why would I record you? That makes no sense.
lab rats.
the game of science and murder.
it's a prototype.
two to four players, ages eight and up.
you're making a board game?
well, it's not just a board game.
gets people to think.
why were you recording us?
I needed your help to flesh out scenarios, and I figured that if I hid the recorder, your answers would be candid and honest.
look, see.
it's like clue, only CSI-ier.
Hodges, this is, uh ...
this is kind of impressive.
in a painfully sad, geek type of way.
well, painfully sad geeks have a lot of spare time on their hands and loads of disposable income.
lab rats could be a gold mine.
little lab techs.
sandy Baxter, fingerprint fanatic.
Reggie Chang, eagled-eyed A/V expert.
andrew Henries, top-notch tox tech.
you named yourself after cancer.
Mindy Bimms, the clumsy yet buxom DNA tech.
clumsy yet buxom?
it's a redeeming feature.
it's - it's a prototype.
so, tell me, do you think that Mindy Bimms is clumsy because she's top-heavy?
or do you just mean clumsy like this?
Oops.
okay, are you ... are you allergic to being honest with me?
cause the thing is, if you had actually asked me to help you with this game, I would have.
but, no, you had to hide a tape recorder under a table and engage us all in this great big thought experiment!
when in reality, it doesn't even matter, apparently, what I think because I'm just Mindy big boobs to you, and I ...
you are the dumbest smart guy I know.
you think I'm smart?
night, Greg.
Yeah, whatever.
Oh, Hodges, I'm so sorry.
it's just that I'm jealous of your intellect.
but Wendy, you have so much to live for.
don't do it. You're too close to the edge.
Oh, and now I'm drowning!
Oh, god!
Oh, god, help me.
help me.
what are you doing?
Oh, uh ... I was, uh, just trying to ...
develop a board game based on this place, but not in any legally actionable sense.
you get evidence, scenarios, analysis.
try to solve diabolical murders.
I like games.
Really?
Yeah.
okay.
let's play.
what makes it hard to catch a killer?
is it the sheer destructive power of the murder itself that obliterates evidence as it snuffs out life?
or is it the chain of events the murder sets into motion which obscure the true crime?
that was good.
or is it a mechanism so complex and diabolical that it borders on the incredible?
in truth, it is all these things, and all these things are the same.
because the only real way to catch a killer, is to outsmart him.
and hope that he's not smarter than you.
so, you were rehearsing your "speech" in front of your computer, and you take a bullet to the head.
no witnesses.
nobody heard the shot, and the killer is somebody in the lab.
am I eligible?
in this scenario, no.
okay.
so during the basic process of the scene, what do I find?
a single nine millimeter casing at the doorway to trace.
then my first blush theory is a walk-by.
I'm going to need the bullet.
then I'm going to need an autopsy.
get it out of your system.
no sign of sexual trauma.
out! Now!
all right, trajectory of the shot was roughly 90 degrees from vertical, straight through his noble skull.
bullet didn't exit.
is it intact?
more or less.
ibis.
the bullet's nose is significantly deformed and the lead base is pitted.
but there are sufficient striae to get a match for what little it's worth.
the gun came through the lab about a week ago in a buyback program, and was subsequently destroyed.
so you were shot by a weapon that no longer exists.
apparently.
okay, let's go over your snuff film, shall we?
I want to see exactly what you did.
in truth, it is all of these things, and all of these things are the same.
because the only real way to catch a killer, is to outsmart him and hope that he is not smarter than you.
do it again. One more time.
wait, wait, wait - - they all want to watch?
professional curiosity. I guess.
in truth, it is all these things, and all these things are the same.
because the only real way to catch a killer, is to outsmart him and hope that he is not smarter than you.
you took the shot in the center of your head, but according to the video, you were not facing the hallway.
which means the bullet didn't come from there.
it must've come from here.
Yes, it did.
a zip gun.
with an unrifled barrel.
and a remote trigger.
what model year is the pager?
pre 1990.
so no call-back numbers.
pre-1990 pagers didn't store them.
so, you're at a dead end?
I'm just getting started.
do I have to walk over to the GCMS or will you just tell me?
the barrel of the zip gun contains traces of black powder.
okay, but the bullet was pitted on the base, which is the result of exposure to smokeless gunpowder.
which means that the bullet that killed you was fired twice.
the killer test fires the gun, knowing it will be destroyed, and keeps the bullet and the casing.
he puts the bullet in a metal tube on a wad of black powder.
with a pager trigger, it's essentially a remote controlled musket.
call the number from any phone or through the internet and ...
impressive.
can you tell me who did it?
well, Bobby Dawson is an early 19th century firearm enthusiast.
he, uh, loads and fires muskets for fun.
Oh, yeah.
big gun guy.
I didn't do it!
I didn't do anything!
I swear!
gun.
what do you got against Bobby Dawson?
nothing.
running gag.
so, you think Bobby Dawson did it?
no.
Bobby was framed.
you drew me a map.
the path of the bullet, if not stopped by your brain mass, would have continued straight through into ballistics.
where Bobby works.
now, Bobby's a real gun guy, and no gun guy would ever position himself down-range of a shot.
you're more than a victim, Hodges.
according to your video, you straightened up just before the fatal shot was fired.
you knew it was coming.
and you made sure that you were in the perfect position to catch it.
I am a mere Padawan in the presence of the Jedi master.
true.
let's play another.
sure.
you weren't ready.
to leave.
this.
the challenges, the puzzles, the job.
no.
but Sara was.
Yeah, she was.
you can't stand in the way of that.
when it's time for someone to move on, you just gotta let them go.
let's play the game, shall we?
okay.
mind if I record this?
scenario 12, Hodges and Grissom.
okay, you walk into the AV lab.
you find Archie slumped over his computer with a knife in his head ...
the world champion goes home with a million bucks.
you want to talk a pressure?
it's all in Las Vegas.
next up, Cody Latshaw???Riding Wintwister, ??? a champ among champions. Ready?
one of the finest bovine athletes in the world today
hurry up
hurry up,????
hold ???
Cody. Hey, Cody, you all right?
you okay? Get a stretcher.
get a stretcher!
I don't need a stretcher.
you sure? I'm okay.
just give me a hand.
all right. Here we go.
Re-ride!
but this is why we call him Lazarus, ladies and gentlemen. Knock him down, and he rises again.
what an athlete!
??? What a hero!
so, who found him?
security.
we have a tough time finding guys to wrangle a bull.
cowboys like to party when they come to Vegas.
did you see anything?
no, we just put the bull back in the pen.
ty Murray, PBR president.
and seven-time world champ.
okay, Dustin.
Jim Brass, Vegas PD.
nice to meet you. Gil Grissom, Crime Lab.
nice to meet you.
what can you tell me about this guy?
Cody Latshaw, a real institution.
most guys his age hung up their rope a long time ago.
what about the bull?
Wintwister- he threw Cody earlier tonight, but he got up and was fine.
he even asked for a re-ride.
"Re-ride"?
well, if a bull doesn't buck good enoughd they can ask to get on another one.
that wasn't the case.
Wintwister had a good day.
Cody must not have been in his right mind to think he'd get a second shot.
is this the rope tie around the bull?
that's one of them.
that's the bull rope.
looks like it's got rosin on it.
Yeah, it helps the rope stick to the glove so they can get a good grip.
do all the riders wear a glove?
Yes, sir.
he's not wearing one.
guy was living the American dream.
every kid wants to grow up to be a cowboy.
not a dead cowboy.
PBR Sports Medicine just sent this over.
taken after Cody's fall in competition.
hmm.
he was held together by every kind of hardware but roofing nails.
I can relate.
riders with ????
they always get the next bull and try like hell to hang on for the next eight seconds.
you sound likeun fan.
I used to date a bull rider.
hewboy up.
thank you.
so there's just a few ws in p hhesu
they??? SURE.
some guys keep valuables in their boots.
Cody's little doggies are right fragrant.
Catherine, take a look at this.
this X-ray shows he walked away from his earlier fall with a hairline fracture of the C1 vertebra.
in bull riding, the rider's spine must sustain vertical, horizontal and diagonal thrust, together if they put tremendous force onto the spinal column.
that guy was a walking time bomb.
any trauma with sufficient force would snap that vertebra and sever the spinal cord.
it did.
the film David just took shows a complete fracture.
that's your COD.
consistent with getting thrown a second time.
Hey!
you got anything to do with taking my bull off tomorrow's day sheet?
do you own the bull?
Yeah, I'm Nancy Twicker.
and I want my bull in the finals.
the more he bucks, the more he's worth.
so whatever you got to do to clear him, get it done.
your bull gave Cody Latshaw a pretty brutal beating.
it's not the bull's fault.
I blame Cody ???
is it true that some riders tie the bull's testicles to get them to buck more?
well, sure, we always want the bulls to buck.
that's why we tie a flank strap across their back.
they're trying to shake it off.
think about it.
if I tied a rope around your testicles, would you feel like jumping up and down?
could a guy get a bull out of this chute without any help?
well, one guy could get a bull all the way to the bucking chute, sure, ????
then he'd have to get on the bull.
and open the gate.
not without help.
the chute only opens from the outside.
can you do it in eight seconds?
even confined like this, these are not the most cooperative creatures.
so if my flank man says get back, you jump.
Hey, Cash.
howdy, Cash Dooley.
and my name's about the only cash I got.
and this is Wintwister?
what, uh...
what would be the safest way for me to handle his hooves?
there ain't one. Too dangerous.
he's a kicker.
do you think I could get him to step on something?
sure. But you better let me do the bending.
uld get him to step on this?
cash knows bulls like nobody.
heck, before these kids could even walk, they're out riding sheep, then calves and baby bulls.
and finally these one-ton, back-jerkin' snot-slingin' monsters.
now, they get all busted up and quit ridin', but they just can't quit these animals.
cotton fiber appears to be bloodstained.
I need another piece for comparison.
forget how to use the scissors?
put your fingers in the holes and squeeze.
Yes, ma'am.
this looks like semen.
cowboy had a roll in the hay.
either he's messy or, uh, we could havou a Brokeback Mountain situation.
Oh ???
me, too.
you know, it takes a big man to admit that.
and I am that man.
you don't say?
Fibem the bull are consarnt with Cody's shirt.
looks like Wintwister's a killer.
if there were any eyewitnesses, they didn't stick around.
okay, thanks.
threw her that far, he must have been going at least...
Tiffany Rigdon, 27, local.
I'll run her for you.
Thanks.
radiator fluid.
bunch of empty liquor miniatures.
card key from Pike's Gambling Hall.
hit-and-run.
hit back there...ran over here.
ro is Cody Latshaw- Durant, Oklahoma.
isn't that Grissom's dead cowboy?
Yeah.
boy, he had a hell of a night.
he gets humiliated...hits a pedestrian...he ditches the car, walks a couple of blocks to the aro joy rides a bull, and then ends up getting stomped to death?
here's another card key from Pike's Gambling Hall right here.
first one's for room 810, registered to Cody Latshaw.
here you go.
second one's also to room 810.
Cody knew the girl he ran over.
lucky for us, housekeeping's low on the uptake.
riding glove.
so he wasn't planning on re-riding Wintwister when he left here.
threw back a bunch of beers, some liquor.
I don't see any drugs.
bed looks used.
maybe he partied with Tiffany.
bet it cost him a lot.
I ran her priors.
she's got a couple for solicitation.
"I can't help now but wonder what your brown eyes were concealing."
they just showed me reflections of all that I was feeling...
our bodies close together like my ride hand in my glove.
hearts pounding with excitement.
and, dare I say it, love.
nobody ever wrote me a poem.
I know I'll never ???
it's your nature to run free, "but I pray the Lord above that one day you'll come back to me."
that's sweet.
by the time you read this, I'll be married.
he's a great guy.
honest, Cody, I'll always be thankful "for everything you did for me."
love, Tiffany.
sounds like it was more than a money relationship.
broken bones- he gets up and rides again.
broken heart and he's a killer.
then we'll ride ff in glory until our time is done
and I will be your hero, your cowboy in the sun.
it's not Shakespeare.
I'm actually a fan of cowboy poetry.
are you really?
Yeah, it's just a way of organizing your thoughts and feelings so that you can make sense of them.
well, it sounds like Cody was trying to make sense out of his girl ???
Yeah, well, poetry can help you with that, too.
rib fractures, multiple lacerations, pulmonary contusions, lacerated aorta, lacerated liver.
I could go on, but you get the idea.
cod was multiple blunt force trauma.
right, but not all of it was from the hit-and-run.
you see the coloration of the bruises?
yellowish.
they're from an event at least ? 12 hours before the accident.
maybe Cody had rejection issues.
could be why she was leaving him.
lot of tools back here.
??? It's an equipment- intensive sport.
what have we here?
some kind of cattle prod?
they don't use those in professional bull riding.
Buckaroos, have you seen Catherine?
cause I just got the results from that semen stain on Cody Latshaw's jeans.
come up with a match?
I did. I had to run an Ouchterlony test on it.
so not from a human donor?
no... no.
bovine.
yeah...
I took a psychobiology cnass once and we studied a very interesting case.
okay, there was a guy, he lived on a farm, and literally the only way that this guy could get sexually satisfied was when he was with livestock.
that's okay. I'm good.
well, see, apparently, the whole thing started one night because he was in the barn- it started snowing.
he got stuck in there.
he couldn't make his way back to the farmhouse, so he decided that he would try and stay warm...
well, with a sheep.
but then the horses were jealous, so...
you know, and I think there was a cow in there as well.
you know, I think we got the picture.
I wish I didn't.
I think I know what this is for.
it's called an electroejaculator.
it's used on bulls that have back trouble.
it looks, uh... pretty persuasive.
Yeah.
so, uh, was Cody helping you collect from Wintwister?
hell, no.
first of all, you don't collect during competition.
right, right, so like an athlete before a game.
now you're talking.
and when I do collect, I bring a service out to the ranch.
you know, one collection from that old boy gives you about...
200 breeding units.
at a hundred bucks a pop, you do the math.
well, if the stuff is so valuable, maybe Cody was doing a little moonlighting, you know, collecting on his own, making a little extra money.
cattle rustling? No, t Cody.
we found bull semen on his jeans.
Cody wouldn't steal from me.
besides, it's a two-person job, no matter which method you use.
there's more than one?
in addition to your electroejaculation, you got what's called an artificiagina.
now, you get a teaser animal in there, like a steer.
see, bulls go homosexual in captivity.
you get that bull to mount that steer, then you get that AV in there right before th... Yeah, I get the point.
do you know this girl?
we think she's Cody's girlfriend.
Yeah.
I thought he had a new girlfriend in Vegas from the way his mood was changing.
she's younger, probably...does whatever he says.
Mm-hmm.
listen, if you need anything else, I'll be at the arena all day.
I thought Wintwister didn't compete tonight.
well, Captain, I'm not a one-bull kind of gal.
here you are, sir.
can I help you?
saw a woman get killed last night.
Hey, Cath, listen, it's Jim.
we got an eyewitness confirming that Tiffany's TOD was after 2: 21 A. M.
well, that's over an hour after Cody's body was found.
Thanks, Jim.
Hey. Hey.
I got prints from the truck, but half of them are Cody's.
well, it is his truck.
so... get this.
there's a witness that puts Tiffany's TOD afteCody's.
he didn't kill her.
there's a set of unknowns both on the truck and on the, uh... electro-love machine.
so... say this partner thought Tiffany knew something about the semen-rustling and he ran her over to keep her quiet.
so who's the partner?
we've got Cody's phone.
find out who he's been talking to.
most of Cody's calls were to a number in Durant, Oklahoma.
he lived on the family ranch.
he was probably letting his folks know how he was doing in the finals.
all other calls were to PBR staff and to Tiffany.
what about her records?
well, they're a little more interesting.
check out...
last night.
a dozen calls after midnight from Eric Hong.
you know this guy?
all right, I don't want nobody hitting me.
all RIGHT.
nobody's going to hit you, Rick.
good.
this is about Tiffany Rigdon.
beautiful girl, skin like butterfly wings.
did you beat her up?
I'm a lover, brother.
let me tell you something, man.
you play around with me, I'm gonna throw your ass in jail.
you feel me?
Yeah, I feel you.
go
so she said she was leaving you, going to get married, right?
Oh, come on, at least admit I'm right about that.
Yeah, okay, sure.
is that when you took her boyfriend's truck and ran her over?
wait. Wait.
it's a good plan, Rick: you get the boyfriend JA and a little revenge tot.
I mean, it's...
okay, I didn't like the girl quitting on me, especially during one of my busiest freaking weeks of the year, and I wanted to talk her out of it.
is that all you did: talk?
no, I couldn't even talk to her.
she wouldn't take my calls, so I quit trying.
where were you making all these phone calls from?
from a country-western bar.
I hit them all when the cowboys come to town.
Mm-hmm, all right, all right, I'll check it out.
Yeah, you do that, please.
I didn't take you for a country music fan.
Yee-ha.
shotgun.
at close range.
would have been pretty loud, but everything is in a place like this.
cowboys < cattle rustling, and now a shooting at the dance hall.
welcome to the Wild West.
so, Coco, you didn't see anyone threaten Precious Ricky?
I was trying to put the nine ball in the corner pocket.
Yeah, right.
you know this girl?
that's Tiffany.
she got married last night.
lucky bitch.
do you know who the groom was?
Troy? Troy something?
know anything about him?
no. She just met him
sweet kid.
he, uh, took her side when that cowgirl trash got all up in her face.
Hey, cowboy. Hey.
like that hat.
thank you.
what's underneath don't look too bad, either.
I'm Tiffany.
I'm Troy.
we know what you are.
excuse me, Miss, but we're having a private conversation here.
why pay that cow when others would get the milk for free?
I think you owe her an apology.
we don't want your kind in here.
Oh, yeah?
that's IT
she came back last night and said that she was going to marry the guy.
it's kind of impulsive, isn't it?
Hey, Cop, somebody says they want to marry you, take care of you, pay all your bills, give you a nice place to live, why would you even wait?
it's always crazy busy with the cowboys in this town.
you know, I think it's being ???
gets them all worked up.
brings out their animal instinct to mate.
according to the marriage bureau, Troy Birkhart and Tiffany Rigdon got their license just before midnight.
and then, what, Troy came over to your chapel to set up the service?
Yeah. He said his girl was changing at the hotel.
it's the old story, you know.
she gets cold feet, he can't face the truth, keep thinking she's running late.
how long did he wait?
hours.
he shows me the prize bus he's won for bull riding.
tells me he's going on the pro tour next year.
the little ranch they're going to settle down on where the wind comes sweeping down the plains.
and what time did he end up leaving?
a little after 3: 00 a. m.
frankly, if she's not going to make a go of it, I say, better now than down the road before all the lawyers and the property and all that mess.
wedding chapel's only a couple blocks from the crime scene.
Yeah, and she was killed at 2: 30. Mm-hmm.
killed?
Yeah, on the way to her own wedding.
I'll get a BOLO out on Troy's vehicle.
Texas plates Charlie Nora Baker Queen Seven Five Zero.
Troy Birkhart, white male adult, wanted in connection with a 415A, Eric Hong homicide.
dispatch, this is C-21 Brown.
the pickup that you're looking for is on level 3 of the PD garage.
suspect is in the vehicle, armed and agitated.
I repeat: suspect is armed and agitated.
copy, C-21. Units responding. Code Three.
Hey, buddy.
Hey. You must be Troy, huh?
all right?
Hey, Troy, listen to me.
we don't want anyone getting hurt, okay?
so put the gun down.
come out of the truck with your hands up.
put the gun down, Troy.
just let it fall away.
now.
he moves on that gun, don'u wait.
hang on, Jim.
let me... Let me talk to him real quick.
okay, but we're not taking any chances.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Hey, Troy, when's the last time you got down to Big Bend?
huh?
you-you got the plate frame.
man, I used to go to summer camp down there.
stay back!
Hey, take it easy, Troy.
look, I got no weapon on me.
okay, I just want to talk to you for a second.
I killed somebody!
Yeah, I know.
you came out to Vegas, and you got in over your head, but this is getting out of control.
if you don't put that gun down, these cops are to start shooting, and that could turn out very bad for both of us.
you know what I mean?
I'm just... I'm just doing the right thing.
making sure you know it was me.
and I'll pay for what I did.
eye for an eye, man.
stay back! I'll do it, I swear!
I'll do it, I swear
no, Troy, just wait. Hang on now. Listen to me.
I know about Tiffany.
I know why she stood you up at the wedding chapel.
that Ricky thought he owned her.
Hey!
Hey, what you doing, man?
he wouldn't let her come.
Hey, man, look at me.
look at me.
I know she wanted to be there for you.
come on out of there, man.
I'll tell you all about it.
come on, give me that thing.
give it to me.
it's going to be okay.
let's Go NICE JOB
you didn't go to summe??
missed you around here.
welcome back.
Thanks.
now ???
because he couldn't have opened the bucking chute by himself.
and we know that someone other than Cody put the electroejaculation equipment into the truck and drove away.
killing Tiffany.
whoever that someone was knew how to get into the arena, and also how to use the equipment.
more cowbell!
I processed these for you.
And?
well, as you can see, they're bull ropes.
these are the kind that the riders hold in their hands.
every rider has one, and they're usually custom-made.
I mean, look at that craftsmanship.
Yeah, it's exquisite.
now, that's the rope that I collected from Cody's room?
Yes, it is.
uh, you'll note that it is polynylon.
now the rope that was collected from the crime scene, though, was long sisal, a type of hemp.
very old-school, and they stopped making it years ago.
that means the rope found with Cody's body belonged to someone who's been around for a while.
how'd you like to go on a roundup?
Hey, Ms. Twicker, how's it going?
it'd be going a lot better if my bull Wintwister was in there bucking.
is Cash Dooley here?
cops want to talk to you.
Hey, Mr. Dooley.
so, where you staying when you're here in Vegas?
here.
he's got the sleeper cab up front.
Oh, right here.
is that where you keep your clothes, the rest of your stuff? What's this about?
I'd like to take a look in that cab.
no. It's private.
now hold on. I own this rig.
if you guys want to search it, go ahead.
well, bull semen is property, and that property isn't yours so it's theft.
now, here's what I think happened.
you know Cody.
he's at the end of his career.
he's a little down on his luck.
never put any money aside.
Wintwister's output goes for 20 grand a"pop"on the open market.
so you and Cody, you get together, you do the deed and, uh, sell it on the sly.
if you knew Cody, you'd know he'd never do anything like that.
and then when he told his girlfriend, you took his truck.
he always let me borrow his truck.
even when it was to hunt downun girl?
we ran his ten-card against the prints from the truck and the equipment.
they don't match. So, there is a third guy?
right. So now, I'm convinced that Cody Latshaw's death was not an accident.
okay, so who is working with you on this, Cash, huh?
who was at the wheel of Cody's truck when you ran down that girl?
was it someone in the arena?
what's this, a cowboy code of silence?
look, you want to make me compel fingerprints from everyone working in that arena,I can do that.
we got a match!
Dustin? He's a bullfighter.
I got a 440 exiting the east end of the arena. Head him off.
don't move.
hands behind your back.
well, howdy, partner.
is is a neperience for me.
first time I caught me a cattle rustler.
look, Cash and me was just trying to make a little extra money.
then Cody Latshaw came in drunk and itching for a fight.
Hey! Quit that!
Hey, Cody.
you hear me?
Cody, relax. Ain't nobody hurtin' anybody. That ain't your property.
Cody, Cody, just...
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
he ain't breathin.
we wasn't tryin' to kill him.
he had a cervical fracture from his earlier ride.
it didn't take much to snap his spine.
then you tried to make it look like an accident.
but you didn't have to run over his girlfriend.
that girl we hit- that was Cody's girlfriend?
Yeah, you didn't know?
we was racing to get the product to our buyer.
and we took Cody's truck 'cause, well, mine ain't air-conditioned, and he wasn't gonna be usin' it.
well.
it's kind of a lonely life, tiese cowboys, every weekend a different town.
that's part of the tradition, you know.
solitary man out there trying to find himself.
Yeah, but no man is an island.
I mean, obviously, he had feelings for Nancy or he wouldn't have written her that poem.
Nancy? I don't know about that. Tiffany's the one that broke his heart. I don't think it's about either girl.
"I can't help now but wonder what your brown eyes were concealing."
did you read Ti?
Oh.
Yeah, her eyes were blue.
so were Nancy's.
then who did he write the poem for?
the bull? I think that's why he went back to the arena that night.
wordsworth once wrote, "Through love we feel we are greater than we know."
my guess is, riding that bull,
Cody felt like a greater man.
our bodies close together, "like my ride hand in my glove."
hearts pounding with excitement, and dare I say it,
love.
I know I'll never own you; it's your nature to run free.
but I pray the Lord above "that one dayou'll come back to "Then we'll ride off in glory until our time is done.
we've got two entry wounds.
and two exit wounds, through and throughs.
any id on her?
no wallet, no purse, no cell.
brass is tracking down the lease.
none of the neighbour seem to know her.
buildings like these get a lot of transients.
people who attend to keep them to themselves.
looks like the drawer's been rifled through.
maybe she walked in on a robbery in progress.
expect there's no signs of forced entry.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven casings.
which means there's seven bullets to look for.
got a strange blood drop.
it's pretty far from the vic.
belonged to the suspect?
it's circular.
no directionality.
suspect would have had to be standing perfectly still.
it's gravitational.
Greg, could you get the hawkeye please?
here you go.
Mitch, could you check the apartment immediately above this one?
you got it, doc.
LVPD, open up.
open the door.
looks like the crime has a second story.
Maria Espinoza, organ donor, heart was in the right place.
Unfortunatelly your head was in the wrong place.
no exit wound.
bullet probably hit bone and fragmented.
OK, so a stray bullet rips throughed the floor.
and mrs Espinoza up winds up collateral damage.
hey guys, i found something.
what do you got?
urine.
there's no sign of any pets in here.
maybe the shooter freaked out and wet himselfs.
not exactly a heart of criminal.
you know the bullet trajectory and the location of the facial wound?
suggest that she was in this position when she was shot.
she was probably tring to hear what was going on down stairs.
shut up!
guess that's the pay to be a nosy neighbor.
yeah but Brass said that the neighbor heard gun shots but they didn't hear any raised voices or arguing.
what was she listening to?
tramp stamp?
looks more like a tramp belt.
help me roll her.
so a hot girl with dollar signed tats in a mostly emptied apartment.
prostitute, right? - Maybe.
maybe she just loves money.
you know, it's the love of money is the root of all evil.
most people think it's just the money.
Oh sage.
washroom.
hey Catherine, are you collecting trace from blondie's body?
as we speak.
so I've collected seven bullets in seven shell casings from the apartment where she was shot.
so what's the problem?
one of these bullets is supposed to be in Mrs Espinoza.
or maybe you recovered a bullet from a different event.
maybe.
have you checked blondie for GSR?
hang on, not yet.
sodium rhodizonate test on right hand.
positive for GSR.
she had a gun of her own.
ballistics confirms that all these 9mm casings were fired in the same weapon.
but doctor Robbins pulled this bullet fragment from Mrs Espinoza.
it's cannelured.
so blondie had a revolver.
hence no shell casings.
OK, so she goes back to her apartment, packing heat.
and somebody is already there waiting to light her up.
one shot goes to the ceiling.
accidently killing Mrs Espinoza.
welcome to the O. K. Corral.
Yeah, jim?
I just got off the phone with the apartment manager.
yeah? Did you get an id on blondie?
it's not her apartment. The name on the lease is kellen tyford.
drops?
the nightclub promoter?
ye, and get this.
he leases the upstairs apartment, too.
that's a lot of apartments for a guy who's getting free room and board.
well, well, well. What's a convict to do?
check and mate.
he played right into it.
Oh, man, that was...
did you see that?
I totally got him.
looks like something more than forensics be jamming a brother up in here.
man, y'all some jinxes, man.
you know, this is a setup. Don't you get it?
Ivy League college student versus a high school dropout convict.
you got no chance.
and so said a jury of your peers.
look, eight months on a weak-ass weapons charge?
it's a vacation. - Vacation, huh?
so who's this?
your house-sitter?
we found her at your apartment over on vegas valley.
what's her name?
Jessica jaynes. J. J. Everybody calls her.
but what happened to her?
she drowned.
so what was she doing at your apartment?
don't know.
you pimping her out, superfly?
pimping her out?
Nah, pimping ain't easy, and you know I'm all about the easy, okay?
J. J. Used to come to my club.
she was a club rat.
sometimes she worked atmosphere.
Oh, atmosphere. What's that, like turning into a smoke machine?
no, more like an atm machine.
you sit her on a couch, tourists start to buy her drinks, she makes me money.
Yeah, especially when the tourist leaves with her.
so what's your cut, easy?
look, if the customers like the atmosphere...
then I try to chuck woolery that. Okay?
I want my customers happy.
you know any unhappy customers, chuck?
look at her.
she even looks good in that picture.
Yeah, I admit, she looks a whole lot better than mrs. Espinosa upstairs.
who did it?
if I knew that, I wouldn't have driven all the way out here to this frying pan in the desert to ask you.
this woman took care of me when I was a kid.
went homeless a couple of years ago...
so I moved her into my house.
when the tax dudes took that, I had to rent the apartments.
top bunk was hers, bottom was mine...
figured it was the least I can do, being as she had to wipe my snot nose all the time.
what was J. J. Doing downstairs?
I told you. I don't know, so unless you want me to start lying...
you never stop.
if that's the way you feel, I'm out.
Mr. Jaynes, we'd be happy to have someone watch your son while you're doing this, you know?
he stays with me.
Mr. Jaynes, is that your wife?
Yeah, and his mommy.
do you have any idea what your wife was doing at the glanville apartments?
she has lots of friends.
she always came home every night... to me. To our baby.
sir.
we almost got all the way around, girl.
maybe these will help out a little?
or would you two prefer to be alone?
Ah, very funny.
so, grissom comes up with a theory, and we get to do the reenactments and the photo docs.
Yeah.
well, it'S...
good to be the king, I suppose.
sure is. - Perfect.
damn it.
Hey, nick, hang on.
what?
that look like a bullet hole to you?
Yeah. It sure does.
38 cannelured revolver round.
I like it when the king gets it wrong.
keeps him human.
the bullet we found in mrs. Espinosa's ceiling was fired from the same revolver as thet ulle bthat went into her cheek.
Yeah, but there were two bullets in the apartment.
and only one hole in her floor.
which means the kill shot had to be a separate event.
I think we got the timeline backwards.
looks to me like J. J. Shot mrs. Espinosa first.
runs down the hall, down the stairs, to the other apartment.
where somebody returned the favor.
Yeah. Who's the somebody?
cause the only name on the lease is drops, and he has a really good alibi.
yeah and even if he knew who it was, he's not going to just give them up.
he may not have to.
so that urine sample that greg found in the downstairs apartment, had female epithelials in it.
now, I ran it through codis. I didn't get any hits, but the suspect has half her dna in common at every marker with mrs. Espinosa.
it's her daughter?
Dana espinosa. Dana's got a record.
she was charged with attempted murder for something involving a japanese businessman with his nose full of blow, skydiving out of the eighth story of the palms without a parachute, but the point is this: There was a defense witness whose testimony exonerated her.
care to guess who?
drops. - Drops.
I don't know, kellen.
I'm having trouble with this idea that you're such a nice guy.
I mean, renting your apartment to a little, old lady and her daughter?
you're right. I'm not a nice guy.
but you plant your seed in a woman, you got to take care of it.
Dana's pregnant?
due next month.
that explains the urine at the scene.
no bladder control, especially in a gunfight.
so make a ho a housewife. I saw that movie.
look, man, first of all, dana was no ho.
I scooped her out the atmosphere before she could get touched.
you sure about that?
stokes: Why would J. J. Kill mrs. Espinosa and then try to kill dana?
I mean, they roll in the same clique. I-I can't explain these women.
one minute, they're sending each other cupcakes on facebook, the next, they're trying to kill each other over a broken curling iron.
but I do know...
that if J. J. Tried to creep on dana, dana ain't just gonna just sit there. She a bad bitch.
if someone's gunning for her or she's gunning for somebody else, we need to find her.
you ain't gonna get her.
she badder, sneakier, more dangerous.
I'll warn the swat team.
let's give her a call. What's her phone number?
phone call? - Yeah.
from your cop phone number? - Yeah.
no chance.
and shwon't answer an unknown caller either.
I'll text in "sugar daddy.
no, this is the kind of girl you have to find in person.
then give us some addresses.
what are you going to do? Map quest her ass?
that's not going to work.
there's only one way to find this girl.
let me out.
no, for real. I mean, I can have her to you today.
you think we can just pop you out of jail?
Yeah. Like 48 hours.
you know, the flick. Nolte busts eddie out of jail.
they get the bad guy. Everything's cool.
you think this is a joke, man?
dead bodies are piling up around your new family.
now, that would worry me.
but if you want to angle for some weekend pass instead of helping us out, that's fine, man. I understand.
let's get out of here. Hey, we out.
are these the text messages that came from jessica jaynes phone?
Yep. No physical phone required.
everything's stored on the server.
you ever worry that you could be replaced by a computer?
every day of my life.
last text she sent was to her husband's number, about a half hour before the apartment shootings.
wit val she knows where d stashed our money.
be back soon wit phat pockets. Kisses to you and bebe.
sounds like this girl was looking for a big score.
we didn't find any money in either of those apartments.
well, maybe that's what got the old lady killed.
d" for dana or drops?
pull up her voice calls. - Yep.
okay, the last call she got was from valinda carlisle.
let's see what val has to say.
Hello?
uh, yeah. Hey, uh, is val around?
I'm afraid she's unable to come to the phone now. Permanently.
how'd you get this number?
valinda called my apartment homicide vic last night.
are there any witnesses?
unis talked to a couple of guys that went to the strip club across the street.
I think they said they saw a pregnant woman getting into the vic's car from the passenger side.
we've got a bolo out on dana espinosa in connection with the apartment homicides.
she's considered armed, dangerous and pregnant.
Ooh, raging hormones and a gun?
we've got to get that off the streets fast.
what's the plan?
look who it is. Mom and dad.
one big happy family, huh?
Yeah, sort of.
get in the car.
I got a feeling I'm going to regret this.
I already do.
you have reached the voice mail of bruce zagberg, registered financial planner.
please leave a message.
voice mail again.
Drops: It's 'cause you don't call zig-zag bruce. He calls you, man.
is there a burger joint or something around here?
no, but what makes you so sure dana would go to this guy bruce anyway?
if dana's on the run, she gonna need some on-the-run money.
let's say zig-zag handles certain aspects of my finances.
what, like laundering the street vig?
no. Actually, my 401k.
why are you always tossing the pimp card at me, man?
I guess to you, a black man in a suit is a pimp.
did I hurt your feelings?
so, is this the place?
what?
you just gonna leave me here? - Yup.
zig-zag bruce ain't gonna tell you squat.
wonder what the schools are like around here. - What?
Drops: You know, seems like a nice neighborhood.
Yeah, probably some sweet little foreclosures coming up soon, too.
sounds like you're thinking about settling down.
looks like you were finally right about something.
single nine-millimeter shell casing.
consistent with the other murders.
grissom: How about the neighbors?
nobody at home. Parents at work, kids at school, and nannies don't like talking to cops.
what about drops? He give us anything besides more bodies?
stokes: No, not yet.
I'll process.
okay.
so, who else would dana go to for help?
zig-zag doesn't seem to be a very big talker.
you're a lot funnier than I remember, crime-lab.
you been going to cop comedy school?
brass: Answer the question, kellen.
I got a stepsister, sherry.
her and dana are pretty tight.
if dana's not with her, sherry should at least know something.
jackson and D.
let's go.
jackson and D. Yippee. We're going to the hood.
Yeah, that's her right there. The round one.
check this out here, fellas.
y'all gonna have to let me do this one solo.
sherry's allergic to badges.
okay, look at this. Instant antihistamine.
look, man, the cop entourage just ain't gonna cut it.
Nah. I need to be alone.
I mean, come on. Where am I going?
you got your game boy on me.
okay, check it out.
I'll cover the street.
what about the cuffs, yo? Cuff?
now, why the hell would anybody talk to someone that's already arrested?
okay. Okay, kellen, give me that. Give me that.
what about a business card? You know, just in case dana ain't around, sherry can get in contact with us, you know?
okay. Don't make me look bad.
do the right thing.
cool. The church on the move.
Hey, sher.
you escape from jail?
no. Hell, no...
Oh, so they just let you out, huh? - Well, I mean...
lying sack! You don't think I see 'em?
you trying to get everybody you know arrested, or maimed, or killed?
you a snake now? A rat?
wait a minute. Miss me with the bs, all right, sher?
I'm just looking for... - for what?
for another damn shortcut?
Dana's mother was killed.
J. J. Was killed, too, and dana's missing.
now, the cops got me out to help find her.
I thought maybe you might know where she is.
last time I talked to her was the night before last.
she wasn't feeling too good.
had to cancel her regular bingo night with her mama.
well, listen, all right?
if she does come around here, or calls you, i need you to call captain jim brass, or nick stokes...
at the crime lab.
don't look at me like that, sherry, please, all right? Just do it.
hold on.
here
stop where you are, kellen, and drop the bag!
Why? - Drop the bag!
what did I do...I didn't even do nothing. - Drop it!
drops. - Okay.
hands above your head. Don't move.
Oh, that is funky. What is that nasty stuff?
chicken gizzards!
Hey, we're not on a lunch break here.
at least in jail, I got one.
What'd she tell you?
nothing. She told him nothing.
all right, come on, kellen. We're going to jail.
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. No, no, no, no, no!
there's one more place to go. - Where?
the office at my after-hours spot.
why would dana go there?
maybe to check out the big-ass safe I got.
let's go.
display last destination.
6555 VEGAS VALLEY DRIVE
got the autopsy report on valinda carlisle.
thought I'd save you a trip to the morgue.
nice.
I found jessica jayne's purse in the glove compartment.
Really?
and address to the glanville apartments on the gps.
okay.
so they were in it together.
valinda drives J. J. To shake down drops' family for some cash.
it goes bad.
J. J. Kills the mother, dana kills J. J.
valinda flees the scene, and, the next night, the pissed-off pregnant chick tracks down valinda and pays her back.
that seems plausible, but there's something still off.
the bullet entered through the back of the skull, and it exited through the forehead, and...
out through the open window.
I think you got lucky.
the bullet grazed the window frame on its way out.
gives you a trajectory.
well, that's good, but the witnesses say that valinda was in the driver's seat when dana got in the car, and if that's true, then, dana had to shoot valinda like this, not like this.
that seems kind of awkward, don't you think?
Yeah, but awkward or not, it definitely lines up the shot.
well, it seems to me that the shot came from the back seat.
there was someone else in the car.
Yeah, dana was here about an hour ago.
she was with some nascar-looking dude.
stokes: And what exactly does a nascar-looking dude look like?
kind of like you.
but this guy's all inked up. He's got that loco look.
you just let a complete stranger into your boss' office?
I thought you were a smart businessman.
I mean, it was dana, your girl. I didn't ask questions.
what is this?
and where's the dj?
that's mini-britney.
it's what the people want.
anybody hungry?
I'm going on a sandwich run.
at least let me get that.
fine. Fine.
Warwick, take me back to jail.
Yeah, see, I got cameras all over this place, man.
let's see who she's with.
let's run this back an hour.
looks like dana cleaned you out, man.
Nah, wasn't nothing in that safe, man.
only dana didn't know that.
so, how come you never told us that before?
you guys sprung me to help find her, and that's what I'm doing.
there she is.
brass: Wait a minute. That's jessica jaynes' husband, walter.
what's dana doing with him?
beats the hell out of me. Walter's J. J.'S pimp.
your favorite word.
he all about the cash.
dude's a man-bitch.
takes care of the kid while she goes out and makes the money.
even tattoos her waist every time she pulls a high-roller trick.
another notch on her belt, I guess.
stokes: I think he's got a gun on her.
J. J. Was after your money. Now walter's after it, and he's taken your girlfriend hostage to get it.
brass: Where's the money, kellen?
cause I'm betting that's where we're going to find the both of them.
well, talk to my lawyers.
better yet, talk to the tax dudes. They know where it is.
house special, times three.
brass: Oh, come on, get out of here, man. What's this look like, a party?
stokes: Okay, I'll check the outside cameras, see if we can see where they went.
I need to put a bolo out on walter jaynes.
I'm gonna put some more mayonnaise on this dry-ass sandwich.
LVPD. Move!
move! Move!
suspect were leaving the scene in a...
a piece-of-crap blue station wagon.
nevada plates, k-c-Z. That's all I got.
a blue station wagon, partial plates, kilo-charlie-zebra.
what did you give drops?
turkey sandwich.
you want to play around with me, huh?
you're under arrest.
for what, serving sandwiches? - Aiding and abetting. Cuff him.
Hey, man.
look, um... look, it was a gps jammer melt.
a what?
drops: I need you to call captain jim brass, or nick stokes at the crime lab.
don't look at me like that, sherry, please, all right? Just do it!
get him out of here. - Come on, man. I told you everything.
you still gonna arrest me?
I was just taking orders, man.
Hey, grissom, don't worry. We're gonna get him.
the undersheriff will be pleased to know that.
the nine-millimeter casing found at the business manager's apartment, and the one from valinda carlisle's car were fired in the same gun.
no surprises there.
Yeah, but it's not the gun that was used to kill jessica jaynes.
I think walter jaynes is the one who's on a rampage here, and he's dragging dana espinosa with him.
any idea where? - No. No, not yet.
you might want to work on that, nick.
we got a lead on the station wagon that scooped up drops.
the registered owner is Walter Jaynes.
he must have had dana in the car with him.
Walter wouldn't just let him in the car to protect the girl.
drops must have something he wants.
the money.
what we have here...
is a misunderstanding.
I understand it just fine.
my J. J.Bangs one of your whales 24-7
from christmas to new year's, and you stiff us.
wait. Wait. Stiff you?
I got busted. I went to jail.
technically, I'm still in jail.
and my baby doesn't have a mother.
neither does dana.
I'm sorry. I thought she was gonna kill me, too.
shut up! - Calm down.
look, look, look at me. Walter, look at me.
don't even listen to her. Walter! Walter, look at me!
see this here? Look. 50 gs, baby.
I won't even take my cut.
that's very generous.
so, uh, we good to go?
you owe me something else.
what? The vig?
what's that, 25 more?
you can take the whole couch if you want to. - No, no, no, no.
I got my pay.
I need my payback.
I lost my wife. I'm going to let you choose which one you lose.
either your girl... or your baby.
drops' gps just came back up.
he's definitely at the apartment.
well, either the jammer died, or... - yeah, or he's calling for help.
okay, listen up.
we got a hostage situation at the glanville apartment, 6555 vegas valley.
we're gonna make a silent approach. Everybody copy?
look... I can't choose.
either you choose, or I choose. Choose!
okay.
the choice is made. - No!
get that scumbag out of here!
Oh, man! Oh, damn!
we have two gunshot victims at the glanville apartments. Code three.
damn. Her water broke. Trauma from the shot.
one of the victims is a pregnant woman. She's going into labor.
that's all I got right there.
Oh, the baby's coming!
just keeping breathing, dana. Just keep breathing, okay?
paramedics are on their way.
here. Relax. That's it. That's it.
he looks healthy.
how are you? You good? - Sore.
I want to hold him.
no.
no? That's my son.
I don't want you to hold him, kellen.
because of you, I heard my mother die.
Where's the money? - What money?
drops' money! - Who?
just take what you want and leave, or I'm calling the police!
I didn't even know it was J. J
what was I supposed to do?
I shot her and ran, and then valinda called.
she said she heard what happened.
said she wanted to help me.
thank you, val. I am so freaked out right now.
I am so sorry.
Dana: Walter made val call me. She was just bait.
Walter said you owed him some money.
you told me you didn't have anything.
so I took walter to zig-zag, thinking he would help.
and when he didn't, he killed him, too.
and for what?
so that you could hide all the money and keep it for yourself?
I had to.
the tax dudes would have taken it.
and, technically, I didn't hide it.
I left it with your mother. - Don't bs me, kellen.
babe, listen, okay, seriously. Seriously, you would have spent it.
then, where would we be?
that was for our future, mommy.
we don't have a future.
when you get out, we'll be gone.
you can't do that.
we're not married, and you're a convict.
I can do what I want.
stokes: Okay, drops, that's it. Time to go, man.
we got to get you transferred back to the prison hospital, okay?
is dana gonna do any time for offing J. J.
Oh, I doubt it. Sounds like a pretty good case of self-defense to me.
what about the money?
I'm not expecting anything. Just wondering.
well, technically, it's the mother'S. It was her apartment.
Dana's the only beneficiary, so the money's really hers.
and my kid'S. - Yeah.
for once, I did something good in my life.
Oh, your life ain't over yet, kellen. It ain't over yet.
she's got a pulse! Airway's clear.
adrenaline's going in.
heart's holding steady at 60.
give me the Ambu bag.
oxygen to 15 liters.
keep the pressure on her.
let's move out, got to go.
got to hand it to the paramedics.
they keep things interesting.
Yeah, well, life does take priority.
I'll ask Riley to stop by the hospital and get their boots for elimination.
where do you want me to start?
wherever you like.
her name is Janelle Rowe.
her daughter's name is Nora.
neighbor heard gunshots, called it in.
is the kid going to live?
it's touch and go.
food's still warm.
what's going on? - Sir, wait.
they must have just got home.
sir... - My daughter. Please.
Oh, my God, Janelle! Janelle! - Sir, sir, sir, you can't come in here, sir.
get off me!
Hey, hey, take it easy. Take it easy.
you're under arrest for assaulting a police officer.
get him up, get him out of here. - No.
no one should have to come home to this.
Yeah, but was it grief or was it guilt?
CSI found a 38 revolver in the glove compartment of your car with empty shell casings in the cylinder, which means it was recently discharged, and your hands tested positive for gunshot residue.
so what if there's a gun in my car?
I have a permit for it.
you had no right to search my car without a warrant.
W-What, what are you talking about?
you were agitated and hostile, you attacked a pice officer.
you fired your gun tonight.
I was target shooting in the desert.
I can show you where.
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Rowe, but unless someone was out there in the desert with you, it's not an alibi.
why would I need an alibi?
bullet entered the neck below the chin and exited just below the right occipital bone.
I'm guessing the bullet's around here someplace.
thanks for the tip.
this chair's been knocked over.
assuming the paramedics didn't do it, there might have been some kind of a struggle.
Hey, Dave, does the vic have any head wounds?
I don't see any...
but I heard the little girl had a forehead laceration.
she might have slammed her head here unless someone else did it for her.
you think I did this?
I want to see my Nora; I want to see my little girl.
she's in Desert Palm Hospital. Severe head trauma.
she hasn't even regained consciousness yet.
I want, want to see her now.
we're going to see her, okay, when we're done.
now, help me out. Think about this.
who would want to do this to your wife and daughter?
I don't know.
so what do you think? It's just a tragic, random act of violence?
why don't you tell me? That's your job.
take a couple of high school kids and put 'em in a fast car.
add a few beers and a driver with a lead foot.
Yeah, baby.
throw in an unexpected obstacle and a little physics...
whoa, dude!
and what you get is very abrupt end to a party on wheels.
you just described my whole senior year which admittedly ended better than theirs.
from their D. L. s, driver is Chase Bowman, passenger is Max Poole.
varsity football at Ridge Valley High.
at least he was wearing his seatbelt.
the safer they make the cars, the more risks the drivers are willing to take.
it's called the Peltzman Effect.
man. Tree practically ate the car.
anybody see anything?
only after the fact.
somebody must have heard something.
we're in the sticks.
houses are pretty far apart.
what do you got?
splinters in the wound.
there's no branches on this side.
if a car hits a tree and there's nobody there to hear it, it still makes one hell of a sound.
Hey, look what I found.
I let my fingers do the walking.
what does that mean?
never mind.
lock's been forced.
this was probably the killer's point of entry and exit.
I'm gonna go search the perimeter.
how many times do I have to say this?
I didn't do this.
let's go over this.
so a neighbor gets up, she hears some arguing, and she looks out her window.
she sees a muzzle flash and hears a gunshot, and she hears footsteps go out a back gate.
now, this neighbor says she hears arguing-- she says it's like a fight club over there.
so I checked dispatch, and there are three calls out for domestic violence in the last three months.
I never laid a hand on Janelle.
you know, one call is, like, a misunderstanding, but three is a pattern.
I loved my wife, but she had
she was a wannabe actress with a flair for the dramatic.
we fought a lot, but it was only words.
well, here's an interesting development.
well, good news.
we have a new suspect. His name is Mark Redding the prime suspect in a homicide about 12 years ago, but he went under the dar for a long time.
but, uh, you must know who he is because according to these fingerprints, he's you.
changing your name is not a crime. Okay?
no, it's not. But let me tell you what is.
your first wife Amy hired a private investigator named Trevor Murphy to find out if you were cheating on her.
of course, you were. Isn't that right, Mark, Peter?
which do you prefer?
so, anyway, this private investigator Murphy he proved Amy was right, and she was, uh, disappointed, so he consoled her, you know, in her time of need.
he comforted her in the biblical sense, and you found out about it, and then Murphy was no more.
his car was found abandoned at a gas station in the desert, and you were the prime suspect.
I was never even charged.
that's because Trevor Murphy's body was never found.
maybe that's because he's not dead, which is what I told the cops back then.
I didn't kill anybody. Okay?
Yeah, but... bodies keep piling up around you. Why is that?
you just having a string of bad luck?
listen, I think I know who might have killed Janelle.
I think I do, too.
I don't have a name, but I've been getting death threats-- anonymous e-mails.
here, I can show you.
I promise death is coming.
you will not know when, but when it comes you will know why.
you will rot like Trevor rots. I will watch.
I've been getting stuff like this for months.
whoever killed Janelle...
I think they, they were gunning for me.
driver's C. O.D. is subdural hematoma as a result of injuries sustained in the crash.
same deal with his buddy, more or less.
multiple skull fractures consistent with flying face-first though a windshield.
C. O.D here is atlanto - occipital dislocation.
so his skull just separated from his spine?
Yeah.
well, at least it was quick. Thanks, Doc.
whoa, whoa, hold your horses.
there's something you should see.
about that shoulder wound you found,
I found a cluster of related injuries on the right arm.
fractured right distal humerus, dislocated shoulder, and torn rotator cuff.
come here.
the direction of applied force in a break is indicated by the fracture plateau.
that's the flat section of bone at the break.
the arm must have been hanging outside the car something like this.
in this case, it indicates that something bent the arm back, snapping it on the backside of the elbow, which in turn caused chain reaction injuries to the rotator cuff and shoulder.
that's an unusual injury for a head-on collision.
could have injured it before the crash?
I don't think so. Bruising doesn't suggest that and all the wounds are perimortem.
well, maybe the arm just broke itself.
that'd be a first. - Thanks.
people vs. Natalie Davis the transfer hearing her mental illness hospital to prison.
the EDR records vehicle data for about five seconds prior to the airbag's deployment.
this indicates that the antilock brakes activated four seconds before impact.
sounds like the car lost traction.
was it wet? - Nope.
was there oil? - No.
according to the data, looks like the driver veered right and then overcompensated left.
if the car veered onto the shoulder, then one tire is on the asphalt.
the other one's spinning in the gravel, which would activate the ABS, and you did find this gravel in the soft top, right?
but you do not appear to be convinced.
the shoulder was undisturbed at the scene.
we're still missing something there, Columbo.
logged onto Facebook lately, Doc?
I've been a little busy.
that's too bad. I just schooled you in Logolous.
I played "quilt" across. The "T" made "ire" into "tire" on a double word score. 36 points.
very impressive.
you want COD on Janelle Rowe?
bullet to the head?
exsanguination from transection of the jugular by a . 38 caliber round, if you please.
and I bet there's something you don't know.
this bruise was inflicted perimortem.
looks like a gun sight.
maybe she was pistol-whipped.
certainly a possibility.
is that it?
yeah... oh, oh, I'm almost forgot.
I played "quartz" off your "Q" with a triple-word score of 72 points.
so much for youth and enthusiasm.
I look forward to old age and treachery.
thanks for coming in, Ms. Murphy. Thank you.
you said this was about my father.
did you find his body?
unfortunately, no.
no, this is about a murder suspect we have in custody.
his name is Mark Redding.
wacky guess: he says he's innocent.
you know, I remember you from when my father went missing.
you bought me a soda in the waiting room.
you were really nice to me.
well, I'm glad I was able to help a little.
you don't remember.
I wish I could forget.
what does this have to do with me?
uh, about nine years ago, uh, Mark Redding changed his name to Peter Rowe.
he said he did it because he felt like there was a target on his back.
couple of months ago, he started to get death threats from anonymous e-mails, and all those e-mails mentioned your father.
my dad had a lot of angry friends.
well, the e-mails were sent from an account that was set up on your IP address.
you think I wrote them?
it's a wacky guess-- did you?
of cours not.
he probably sent them to himself.
do you mind if I ask you where you were last night?
do you mind if my lawyer answers?
you guys are unbelievable.
uh, Ms. Murphy.
we have a warrant for your computer.
knock yourself out.
my dad has been dead for a long time.
all I want to do is get on with my life.
just leave me alone.
the pink cell phone belonged to Nora Rowe.
maybe the killer took it.
why would the killer take a kid's cell phone and then ditch it less than a block away?
probably thought they trashed it.
most people don't realize how tough these memory cards are.
look at this.
most of these pictures were taken within two hours of the murder.
hold it.
that's Janelle Rowe's kitchen, taken right around the time of the shooting.
you know, the neighbor said that she saw a muzzle flash when she heard the gunshot, but what if it was a camera flash?
no, get away...
I bet the killer thought his face was in that photo.
got Ballistics on Peter Rowe's gun.
it's not the murder weapon.
no IBIS hits on it, either.
well, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say he didn't do it.
Okay...you know, let's say he was telling the truth, that someone blamed him for the death of Trevor Murphy, and his wife and daughter got caught up in the revenge.
so, the death threats were more than just threats.
so, let's find out who really sent those e-mails.
on the left, the exemplars from the aspen tree found at the crime scene.
on the right, the splinters from the passenger's shoulder wound.
they're different.
whatever stabbed him, it wasn't that tree.
it was, uh, treated hardwood and white ash, known for its durable bending quality and hardness.
not unlike me.
you didn't learn anything in sensitivity training, did you?
I took what I needed, and I left the rest.
where would you find white ash?
it's found in long handles, such as garden rakes, spades, shovels.
and it's also found in some baseball bats, because it's a lighter wood wita long grain.
mailbox baseball.
these guys were playing mailbox baseball.
Yeah, that would explain the weird fracture to his right arm.
Yeah, right there, right there!
you're serious.
Oh, yeah, I'm dead serious.
it's really fun.
when you're a bored teenager who's feeling destructive.
if you knock the box cleanly off its post, then it's a home run.
everything else, just a base hit.
that's pathetic.
actually, it's awesome. - It's a release.
you know, in high school, in chem club,
I once painted iodide of beryllium on the inside of my best friend's desk drawer, let it dry overnight, so when he opened up the drawer the next morning, he got this-- pa! -- explosion of pink powder in his face.
for no reason.
well, this is all very fascinating and really quite sad, and while it might explain the roots of violent crime, it doesn't explain why you didn't find a bat at the scene or how a mailbox full of air could shatter an arm.
recess is over.
and it... did it go in his mouth?
Oh, yeah. Went in his mouth-- he was walking around school like a lizard, like...
you're a serial killer.
you crushed the skull of a rock star while he was eating breakfast.
you poisoned an elderly woman, whose convulsions sent her flailing through a window.
you electrocuted a janitor at a chicken slaughterhouse.
you gassed an undercover cop.
and when your foster father, in an attempt to protect you, confessed to your crime in a video suicide, you kidnapped a CSI and trapped her under a car, alone, in the desert, and left her to die there.
you were captured and you were tried by a jury of your peers in a court of law.
what was the verdict?
I was found guilty, but mentally ill.
and what does that mean?
it means that when I committed my crimes, I knew that what I was doing was wrong.
but after I was arrested, I suffered a psychotic breakdown.
you were diagnosed with catatonic schizophrenia.
you don't seem catatonic now.
I'm taking medications that make it go away.
and how do you feel?
I feel like I used to.
normal.
and that is why you no longer need to be treated in this psychiatric facility.
you are well enough to serve the sentence that you were lawfully given.
you're not mentally ill.
not anymore.
you're just guilty.
Doneo treat the catatonic schizophrenia.
I'm quite pleased with the results.
how are you treating her psychopathic compulsion to kill?
we're not really.
she's on a couple of anti-O. C.D. meds, but...
isn't it true that as the catatonia lifts, her psychopathic tendencies will eventually reasser themselves?
it's certainly possible.
that's because Natalie Davis has an incurable disease.
do we imprison people with M. S?
with cancer?
she is not responsible for her actions.
she needs help.
she needs to remain here.
thank you, Counsel.
these proceedings will resume at 10: 00 a. m.tomorrow.
until then, we're adjourned.
come on.
Dr. Grissom.
miss Nichols.
glad to see you.
is Sara coming, too?
I'm afraid she's not available.
I see.
you know, Gil, you were the only person in the room when Natalie had her psychotic break.
it would really help me out if you'd get up there and testify.
I can't render an opinion to her mental state.
I'm not a psychiatrist or a psychologist.
I'd call you as a percipient witness.
you'd only have to testify about what you observed with your own eyes.
how she was then, and how she is now.
I can arrange a meeting with Natalie.
okay.
I would like to see her.
Archie located the e-mail server that sent death threats to Peter Rowe.
I thought they were sent from Kelsey Murphy's house.
the e-mail account was created there.
the e-mails themselves came from a halfway house downtown.
I assume Brass is checking it out?
definitely.
I had them fax over a resident list.
one of the names jumped off the page.
Kelsey has a brother.
making death threats is a felony, Nathan.
so I go to jail for that while Mark Redding gets to walk for murder?
he's only a murderer according to you.
how'd you find him?
my dad was a P. I.
and the Internet's a beautiful thing.
right.
why should Mark Redding live happily after what he did?
new name, new wife, new life?
it makes me sick.
I wanted him looking over his shoulder at night, feeling afraid.
I gave Nathan my old laptop six months ago.
he was staying with me for a few days, and that's when he set up the account.
that's why it traced to me.
so, why didn't you mention that earlier?
he's my brother.
I wanted to protect him.
so you two are close?
not anymore.
why is that?
when we're in a room together, he doesn't see me.
he only sees Dad.
somebody had to remind Mark Redding what he did.
did you do anything other than write e-mails?
I wanted to kill him.
I think about it every day.
if anyone had ever laid a hand on me or my sister when my dad was alive, he would have laid them down like dogs.
if my dad saw me now...
letting the scumbag that killed him breathe air for nine more years...
he'd spit on me.
his son should have been stronger.
where were you last night between 8: 00 and 10: 00?
on the strip alone.
come on.
come on, Nathan.
you got to do better than that.
Why?
because Mark Redding's wife was murdered lt night, and his daughter is hanging on by a thread at Desert Palm Hospital, that's why.
I want my phone call and a lawyer.
Yes!
for God's sakes! Are you trying to break your arm?
Oh, no. Don't sweat it. I tried it on the dummy first.
if it didn't break his arm, it's not gonna break mine.
we're thinking telephone pole, sign post.
I want to go back out to the crime scene, check it out.
then why are you guys still in here smashing mailboxes?
because it's fun.
my turn.
I'm gonna go a little bit faster than you did last time. - Please go faster...
and I wonder why I'm still single.
Hodges. - Hey, it's Nick.
did you have a chance to process that gravel I collected from the convertible top yet?
of course.
it was concrete.
Why? Did you... - Thank you.
Hey, I want to be cooperative here and everything, but, uh, you know, seems to be a little bit intrusive.
Yeah. Well, we could get a warrant, Mr. Jackmin, but we'd have to keep you out of the house if we did.
seems like a real big hassle to me, you know, unless you got something to hide.
uh, no. You know, hey, like I said, feel free to look around.
notice that your new mailbox out there is removable.
why is that?
uh, old one got smashed a while back.
kids, huh?
Yeah.
did you do it yourself?
I'm a do-it-yourself kind of guy.
it's a nice walkway.
Thanks.
this looks new.
Charlie, give me a hand, will you?
what is this?
a concrete-filled decoy?
man, you really taught those boys a lesson, huh?
four times those kids trashed my mailbox.
four times!
Yeah, there's a better way to handle it.
weren't you ever a kid?
course I was.
if I met myself now the way I was then, I'd kick my snotty nose ass.
I didn't mean to hurt those people.
I heard the crash, I went out there.
there was nothing I could do for them.
Oh, no.
no, but you could still do something for yourself, huh?
what was I supposed to do?
just roll over and let them keep on doing it to me?
you could have done something else.
use cinder blocks, set up a camera to get their license plate, but this?
I didn't make them smash that mailbox.
no.
but I bet you were hoping they would, huh?
Mr. Jackmin, you're under arrest for two counts of negligent homicide.
Hello, Natalie.
hello.
I wasn't surprised to see you yesterday.
you weren't?
you want to make sure I go to jail.
I understand that.
people who do bad things need to be punished.
well, I think you're already being punished.
then why did you come here?
the only time I ever saw you, you weren't yourself.
I wanted to see the person you really are.
here I am.
is Sara gonna speak at the hearing, too?
no.
she doesn't work with us anymore.
because of what I did to her.
I don't know.
occupational therapy?
by working with the thing I fear the most, I diminish its power.
I'm very sorry for what I did to Sara.
and to you.
my foster father killed himself because of me.
I was wrong to blame anybody else for it.
is that how you really feel, or is that how you think you should feel?
I understand if you don't believe me.
psychopathic personalities are very often skilled at mimicking genuine emotion.
but I'm truly sorry.
a year before Trevor Murphy disappeared, he was staking out a liquor store for a client.
one night the joint gets robbed, Trevor storms in and drops the suspect with one shot
it's pretty ballsy for a P. I.
Yeah.
well, the bullet was still in evidence.
so, I compared it to the bullet that killed Janelle Rowe.
ballistics confirms they're both fired from the same weapon, a . 38 Special.
it's not uncommon for a killer to keep his victim's gun.
what if Kelsey and Nathan are right?
Peter Rowe killed their father, used Trevor's own gun to do it.
I'll call Brass.
we'll bring Peter back in.
Dr. Grissom, your department pursued the so-called "Miniature Killer" for nearly a year before you identified her as Natalie Davis.
by the time she was captured, she had kidnapped a member of your team.
you interviewed her one time.
why only that once?
during the course of our interview, she had a psychotic break.
objection.
witness has no medical standing here whatsoever.
sustained.
will you please rephrase?
during the course of our interview, Ms. Davis became non-responsive.
so, one moment you were having a conversation, and then the next...
tell me where Sara is!
I've got a pain in my sawdust.
that's what's a matter with me.
she started singing.
to you?
no.
I believe she was singing to her dead sister.
objection.
sustained.
her eyes were no longer focusing on me.
she no longer seemed to hear what I was saying.
all right, Dr. Grissom, you've been here with us in this room and you spoke to Natalie this morning in the laundry.
how does she appear to you now?
she makes eye contact.
she answers questions in a logical manner.
she seems very present.
she even expresses remorse for her past actions.
in other words-- normal.
thank you.
I really only have one thing to ask you, Dr. Grissom.
what do you hope to get out of coming here?
I don'understand the question.
let me help.
are you trying to punish Natalie for what she did to Sara Sidle, your co-worker and lover?
objection.
I'll allow it.
during our interview I did become frustrated.
Oh, I know, I saw the police video.
you violently shook Ms. Davis when she wouldn't give you Ms. Sidle's location.
if you'd been alone and unsupervised, you could've beaten it out of her.
objection, this is hythetical.
as I said, I was frustrated.
I was also afraid for my co-worker.
then you are here for revenge?
I don't care about revenge.
I have no stake in the outcome of these proceedings.
whether Natalie stays here or goes to prison is at the discretion of this court.
I've been trying to believe that people can change.
even people who are damaged.
but I don't know if they can.
I just don't know.
brass went to Desert Palm to look for Peter, but he was already gone.
so, head of surveillance sent me over this security video for you.
did someone tip him off?
well, that's what I would have thought until I saw this.
Peter went down to smoke a cigarette every couple of hours.
that's Kelsey.
look how she's standing behind him, with her hands in her pockets.
does she have a gun?
that looks pretty intense.
Where'd they go?
let's see what she drives.
look at that.
Kelsey's car is equipped with an Auto-Shadow G. P.S. system.
we'll need an Attorney General Waiver to activate it - Please... - Dig!
let's put the gun down, Kelsey.
tell them what you did.
tell them!
I killed...
I killed Trevor Murphy, and I buried him.
if you do this, Kelsey, I can't help you.
give me the gun.
when Nathan told me he found him, I...
I couldn't get it out of my head.
I staked out his house for a few weeks.
just like dad would've. Learned his schedule.
they weren't supposed to be there!
mom!
get away from my daughter!
everything got so messed up.
we know you didn't mean to hurt Janelle and Nora.
we know that.
Dig!
now I talked to the hospital.
the little girl's going to make it.
Really?
good.
that's good.
now all you have to do...
is give me the gun.
we can still fix it.
listen to them. Please.
shut up!
I confessed, all right? Arrest me.
just-- I'll spend the rest of my life in jail.
shut up!
just-- Come on, everybody, just take it easy.
relax. We don't have to do anything.
so don't do anything.
just calm down.
daddy...
that's good.
okay.
there you go.
that's okay.
come on.
give me the gun.
come on.
I really tried to forget.
come on.
judge Brenner has ordered her to be transferred to the State Prison in Jean.
she'll continue to receive her meds, but as far as therapy goes, they can't do much.
I'm sorry I couldn't have been more help.
I'll take her from here.
you're wrong about me.
I really have changed.
I have changed.
and I really do believe that people who do bad things...
need to be punished.
drop your weapon.
drop your gun!
drop your gun now.
you can't win; it's four on one.
then I guess it's just about how many of you I take with me.
it's okay, Riley. We got you covered.
you're dead.
nice shot, Willows.
Thanks.
and, Adams, you get points for calling Sanders by your name to communicate your intentions.
that's a good job.
Hey, how many points does she lose for missing?
I don't want to be defensive or anything, but the only reason I missed was because Greg couldn't get out of the hold.
Oh, please.
lee knows the signals better than we do.
and besides, you could've been more subtle.
play nice, kiddies.
I need sidearm clearance and I've got to take a look at the tactical manual again.
these codes are very, very confusing.
uh, the most important signal is Code Four.
situation's secure-- Code Four.
second most important: four eighty-two.
I know this. 482 is... What is it?
lunch. - Okay.
and Riley's buying. - Nice.
I'm buying? Well, then I hope you all like value meals.
this is Catherine.
uh, uh, ten minutes out.
copy that.
multiple 419s at Green Valley and Elm. All hands on deck.
I looked at a house around the corner from here when I first moved to town.
I thought this was a nice neighborhood.
it is.
I heard this big crash, so I ran outside, and I saw three, maybe four guys fighting with Reggie Hatcher.
bill came out running with his gun.
he tried to stop the fight, then they shot him.
it was likeHalo 3; everybody started shooting.
next thing you know, I go down.
okay, here's what we got.
a call came into 911 at 11: 00 p. m.-- shots fired.
neighborhood Watch captain was shot dead in the street.
a seven-year-old boy was shot and killed by a stray bullet when he came out to see what was going on.
all this happened in front of the Hatcher house.
any suspect info?
well, it's early, but what we know so far is it could be between two, three or four suspects, black, Hispanic or white.
they were driving an SUV that's either black, navy blue or dark green. Okay?
I know that doesn't give us much to work with.
there's plenty for us to work with here.
the suspects then proceeded on foot to the Hatcher house.
the owner, Priscilla Hatcher-- she was transported to the hospital with a head injury, so the interview was limited-- but she told me that a group of men
uh, she wasn't specific about how many-- broke in, they roughed her up, they roughed up her son Reggie and her nephew Frankie.
so what do the son and the nephew have to say?
well, they're in the wind. We're looking for them.
so they could've been abducted.
something bigger than a bullet came through this window.
you've got bloody glass, blood drops.
fight looks like it came out this way.
well, that confirms what Priscilla Hatcher said.
she said that her son Reggie got into a scuffle with one of the intruders, and they came through the window.
the Hatchers were the targets, yet suspects didn't park out front.
maybe the suspects didn't want the vehicle to be seen.
or didn't know which house they were going to hit.
why don't you guys take the house. - All right.
the Neighborhood Watch captain. His name is Bill French.
he's a veteran.
survived a tour in Iraq only to get gunned down in front of his own house.
it's a shame, really.
we have a gun here.
he got off two rounds.
.38 caliber.
nine millimeter.
shells all over the place.
most of the recent gang shootings were with nines.
a blood pool and a blood trail away from the body.
got to be from a second source.
maybe the Watch commander shot one of the bad guys.
you got this, Riley? - Yeah.
sir, I know this is hard. - I am just doing my job.
just leave us alone. - Sir, please...
listen, you can't take him.
I'll drive him to the hospital, okay? I'll drive him.
sir, please. I need to take him.
you don't even know his name. - Excuse me.
I'm Greg Sanders. I'm with the crime lab.
what is your son's name?
all right, Mr. Morley. Jason's no longer with us.
he's in a better place.
there's nothing any of us can do to change that.
but you have to let us take him, so we can figure out who did this.
david here will take very good care of your son. I promise.
sir, please.
okay. Okay. Okay.
fresh collision damage.
and broken car lights.
paint transfer. Got to be from our suspects' vehicle.
that's what I'm thinking.
suspects' car is parked on the west side of the cul-de-sac, facing north.
right.
if that blood does belong to one of the suspects...
I'd say he got into his car, peels out, leaving behind these yaw marks...
go, go!
sideswipes the two parked cars?
Yeah, that's about it. - Riley.
make sure that you process the collision damage on the two cars.
you got it, boss. - Thank you.
this must be Reggie and his cousin Frankie.
Reggie was valedictorian of his high school class.
smart kid.
hope he has some street smarts, too.
I'll go take a look around the rest of the house.
okay.
what do we have?
I got a pretty good handprint off the TV here.
we have two bedrooms-- Mom's and Frankie's.
found a rolled up sleeping bag and Reggie's backpack on the floor in Frankie's room.
he's a student at WLVU.
I don't think he lives here though.
maybe he comes home to do his laundry.
according to this...
he lives right down the street.
it's all clear. Nobody home.
this is the house the SUV was parked in front of.
Yeah, Brass.
okay, look, I'm going to want to talk to him. I'll be right there.
so a shooting victim just rolled in to Desert Palm Hospital.
could be one of our suspects. I'm gonna go. Are you okay?
I'm fine.
when can we talk to him?
well, he's in rough shape. The docs are working on him.
the bullet hit an artery. He's lost a lot of blood. I don't know... Hey, Doc.
he's dead, I'm afraid.
we found a gun on him.
it's in there with his clothes and a bullet that I pulled out of his leg.
thank you. - Sure.
nine millimeter.
cuts on his face-- maybe he went through the window with Reggie.
Snakeback tattoos.
guy's a gangbanger.
five arrests for drugs and various armed assaults.
well, the Snakeback gang's primary source of revenue is drugs.
but that street-- it's not in their territory.
well, Reggie Hatcher was a student at WLVU, which is in their territory.
maybe Reggie knew them.
that would make Reggie the target, not the house.
then Reggie and Frankie are probably dead.
let me drive.
just give me a second here.
I'm trying to do Archie a favor, not get him fired.
he's at the Academy meeting.
in Denver. Which means he's snowboarding.
there is more to life than work.
that's a lesson I learned from your predecessor.
where did it go?
camera angle's too high. I can't isolate the driver's face.
good. I thought I missed something.
with these tinted windows, you can't tell if anyone else is in the back.
but I did get you the license number.
and, uh, just for the record, Archie may be riding a half-pipe, but it's only in between lectures.
such as, uh,"Breath Analysis as a Forensics Tool.
that one's for me. It's a part of our deal.
he got funded and I didn't.
R. O.is Marcus Garfield.
so I got you the driver. - No.
he may have driven to the crime scene, but he didn't drive to the hospital.
he's the one that got rolled out.
Hey, ran the bullets and the shell casings. All nine mill.
14 from the dead suspect's gun, 13 from some other nine.
27 in total.
so they were packing high-capacity semiautos.
Nick and Langston didn't recover any ammo evidence from the Hatcher house.
if they went there to kill Reggie, they would have shot him inside.
if they didn't want to kill him, what did they want?
Jim, what's up?
copy that. On my way.
brass may have just found both Reggie and Frankie.
Oh, decomp.
the mall security smelled it, too.
when she was writing up the third parking violation.
the car's registered to Aaron Sweets.
he ran with the Snakebacks.
and according to his record, he knew Marcus Garfield.
James, come on in and open this up.
we're only about six or eight blocks from the crime scene.
well, that's not Reggie or Frankie.
who's buried in Grant's tomb?
sweets. You see the candy cane?
well, first ticket was written day before yesterday.
well, that means Aaron Sweets is not our missing suspect.
that makes four.
all. 22s.
none of the players in our mess had. 22s. TOD?
Mr. Sweets here had assumed room temperature.
been dead 24 to 48 hours.
so he was dead before the shoot-out?
I get gangbangers in here all the time.
might be unrelated.
scenes were six blocks apart in a nice neighborhood.
this isn't just a coincidence.
Marcus Garfield and an unknown suspect gained access to the Hatcher house there.
he's not unknown anymore.
I ID'd the handprint on the TV-- Robert Danward, aka Little Bobby.
another member of the Snakebacks.
all right.
we compared the blood on the glass to the DNA on the toothbrush found in Reggie's backpack.
confirmed that Marcus Garfield and Reggie crashed through the window together.
the fight continued into the street.
according to the witnesses, the Neighborhood Watch captain confronted the suspects.
the bullet pulled from Garfield's leg matches the Watch captain's. 38
the bullets they pulled from the Watch captain came from Garfield's nine.
one of Garfield's stray bullets hit Jason Morley who lived here.
he was the seven-year-old boy.
aaron Sweets, another Snakeback, was shot four times with a. 22
his body was found in the trunk of his car in a parking garage six blocks from the crime scene.
there was no. 22 ammo at the scene.
can we find any connection between Sweets and Reggie?
brass checked with WLVU.
um, Reggie's a straight-A student.
he was accepted early admissions for graduate school next fall.
and I checked Reggie's cell phone and land line records.
no calls to or from our suspects.
what about Sweets?
didn't have his number.
try 555-0121.
sweets called Reggie's land line six times in the last four days.
well, that's our connection.
has anyone checked Reggie's house?
the uniforms cleared it, but they were only looking for bodies.
I tore the kitchen apart.
no drugs, no weapons.
this doesn't really look like a college kid's place.
Reggie inherited this house from his grandmother.
lots of sculpture, paintings.
lots of phone jacks in Grandma's house, but no phones.
did you see a phone in the kitchen?
no, and none in the master or guest bedroom either.
let's try Reggie's home phone number.
Yeah.
who puts a phone in the closet?
wait, wait, wait. Let me go first.
when you start carrying a gun, you can lead next time.
odd place for a phone. - Yeah.
Piperidine, ether, cyanide.
hydrochloric acid, magnesium turnings.
this is a PCP lab.
this is all highly explosive.
we should get out of here. - Yeah.
word on the street is a college kid with talent as a mixer is pushing sherms in the Snakeback turf without paying them tribute.
okay, so Reggie's got a target on his back because he's operating under a different business model?
you can get a degree, but it doesn't make you smart.
any word on Little Bobby?
I heard he's taking some vacation time.
what do you want?
Hey, I just wanted to let you know we got the the guy who shot Jason.
he's a known gang member.
I'd like to rip his heart out.
I'd like to let you... but he's already dead.
I know it probably doesn't help.
you have to do this very often?
it's not part of my job.
thank you.
I lost my wife last year.
Jason... just started sleeping in his own bed again.
cops like coffee, right? You want a cup?
sure.
send these up to Catherine.
she says Hazmat wants to know exactly what's down here.
pure white powder.
clear crystal finished product.
usually this stuff looks like yellow sludge.
Reggie had it going on.
it's high grade.
blood. Still wet.
stop right there!
don't move!
Hey, I'm just gonna go check on my guys.
if you need anything, let me know. - All right.
drop your guns!
we're not cops. We're lab techs. We don't carry guns.
over there! Sit down!
just put the gun down, okay?
we'll do whatever you want.
there's a lot of chemicals in here. If you shoot, you're gonna blow us all up.
sit down! Shut up!
go! And shut up!
what happened to your friend? - I said shut up!
knock, knock? Anybody home?
who the hell is that? A cop?
no. He works with us.
I'm gonna get rid of him, okay?
you don't need any more problems.
Hello?
Hey, guys.
get over here.
Hey, you down there? I was in the neighborhood, thought I'd stop by, see if you need any...
it's okay. Riley...
we don't need any help.
okay, Sanders.
see you back at the lab.
here, sit, sit!
we have a situation downstairs.
suspects on the premises.
there's a surveillance camera over the front door.
I'm going to go call it in.
Hey, Greg.
Langston and Riley have been taken hostage at the PCP lab.
I don't know who or how many.
I'll call SWAT, notify Catherine.
you're Reggie, right?
Hey, man, you listen, okay?
I'm not gonna tell you again, okay?
just sit there and shut up.
all right, Frankie, try to calm down.
how do you know who I am?
Reggie, your mother's in the hospital. She's worried about you.
she's worried about the both of you.
Reggie looks like he's hurt pretty bad, Frankie.
I can help him. I'm a doctor.
I can help him. All I need to do is look at him.
go.
no, no, no, you sit.
I need more light to examine him properly. Can we bring him into the lab?
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.
but this better not be a trick!
we'll lay you down on three. One, two... three.
you hanging in there?
is my mom okay?
I think she's going to be fine.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
well, no one ever does.
am I gonna die?
if you tried to take this glass out yourself, you probably would have.
you know, I was...
I was a big fan of Steve Irwin.
me, too.
Hey, come on, man, there's nothing wrong with his head.
get your finger off of there.
I need to check his vitals; his heart rate.
I want to make sure that he doesn't go into shock.
look at me, Reggie. Open your eyes, look at me.
good. Okay.
Frankie, Reggie's having a reaction to the chemicals in this room.
he's been in here too long and so have you.
we've to get the both of you out of here.
no, no, no, no. What do you think I am, stupid?
I think you care about what happens to Reggie.
Frankie, let him help me.
Oh, come on, Reg. Don't be on their side.
what, are you stuck on stupid, too?
can't you see they're playing you?
you know, that's your problem.
you always let people sucker you.
my problem was I tried to help you.
I should've just let you die in the streets, man.
Mr. Book Smart.
man, you ain't that smart.
you don't know nothing about the real grind like I do.
the real grind, Frankie? - Yeah.
the real grind? - Yeah.
the only thing you know is a gun.
without that gun, you're nothing!
I'm nothing?
man, without me, you wouldn't even have a dime for grad school!
I'm the one who turned your little chemistry projects into paper!
and then you want to go pay off Sweets like a chump.
man, you didn't need to pay for protection!
talking about, you need protection, this and that!
you didn't need protection! You had me!
I'm the one who killed Sweets!
I'm the one who protected your ass when you need it!
that was me! Me! - Look at me, Frankie!
what? - He's bleeding.
sit back, Reggie, sit back, sit back.
all right, Frankie, he's gonna die if I don't help him.
you've got the gun-- that means you're in charge, so you better make a decision.
okay. Do something, whatever.
I need, um, a towel, some kind of cloth to clean up this wound.
I have to irrigate the wound. I need alcohol or water.
do you have any of that here in the lab?
we also have to seal up all those chemicals.
Yeah, okay. Go.
here... Here are paper towels. fresh water over there.
we don't have any lids here.
but I have some tape in my kit that will work, okay?
okay. Go.
what the hell are you doing?
Frankie! You calling the cops, huh?
is that what you doing, Miss Smart-Aleck, huh?
leave it! Drop it!
listen to me. If I don't pick up that radio...
it's going to send out a "horizontal alert.
now, that means the police will know that we're in trouble within 30 seconds.
so just let me pick it up, okay?
turn it off. Turn it off! T - Turn it off! Turn it off!
ray e-mailed me photos from the PCP lab, one of which includes a surveillance monitor.
the suspects have a clear view of the front of the house.
we got a three-man entry team right here. We'll find an alternate way in.
I'm running the show here, okay?
Hey, we got an open mic.
look, tell me who's going to help me here with Reggie.
I need another pair of hands.
Reggie and Frankie are both in there.
are you going to help me? - Sounds like Reggie's injured.
which means there's probably only one gun in there-- Frankie's.
get your... get your little nurse lady to help you.
that's right, go over there. Go help my cousin.
Frankie, listen to me.
you haven't hurt anyone yet. But if you...
if you pull that trigger, that. 22 is going to change everything.
Frankie's got the. 22
sweets was killed with a. 22
I haven't hurt anyone yet? Is that what you just said?
I wasted a guy, okay? I killed a gangbanger.
it's not like the court's going to execute me. I'm only 14!
so, go ahead! Just do something! Just fix my cousin!
what the hell are they doing here?
it's a damn news chopper.
this is restricted air space. We'll get them out of here.
cops?
it was the radio!
you tricked me, you bitch!
Frankie, that's enough. - You!
if he dies... then we all die.
Frankie, just let me answer the phone and tell them that we're okay.
no, no, they don't need to know squat.
look, Reggie has got to get to a hospital.
but you said you could fix him.
I don't have the proper equipment.
he needs a surgeon. I'm not a surgeon.
but you're a doctor, right? - Yes.
Yeah, so, so, so figure out something.
doc... I don't feel good. Everything is spinning.
um, all right, I have, uh...
well, I can use the ether to put you under.
I've got a scalpel in my kit to make the incision.
and hemostats, to clamp off the veins before I remove the glass.
um, I still need other things.
I - I need, uh, gauze, sterile gauze, a needle and thread, antiseptic.
we don't have any of that stuff. - Okay, I have all of that.
it's up in the first aid kit.
but it's in the truck, upstairs.
no... No. No one's going anywhere.
I can help Reggie, but I need the kit. I have to have it.
let me tell them I'm coming up there.
this is another... another one of your tricks, isn't it?
this isn't a trick, Frankie.
I want us all to walk away from this, okay?
this is Adams.
are you and Langston okay?
Yeah, yeah. We're okay.
without alerting the suspects, can you describe the situation in detail?
we have a kid down here who is injured. He needs medical attention.
I'm going to come up and get the first aid kit from the truck.
Langston is going to stay here.
I have to be able to come back down.
okay.
she's got to go back in, or Langston's dead.
Jack, give me a walkie.
I want to talk to her.
the front entrance and the street are covered by surveillance.
they'll be waiting for us to make our move. - Okay, I got it.
we got to try. I can't just sit here and do nothing.
the tree behind the Denali is the edge of frame.
stay behind that.
right. Yeah, I got that.
why is she going to the back of the truck?
we keep the first aid kit in the back of the truck, Frankie.
you have to trust us.
she better not run.
how you holding up?
how many guns?
you armed?
then you know what you got to do.
Frankie, bring me that bottle of ether, please.
Yes, that's it. Put it down there. Thank you.
I came right back.
Frankie, I'm going to open this up so you can see for yourself no tricks.
please, please, don't... don't touch any of that.
you'll contaminate it, and Reggie could get infected.
look, I'm going to need another pair of hands.
which one of you is going to help me?
ain't gonna be me. - Relax, Frankie.
you just worry about how you're going to get us out of here.
be strong.
Riley, I want you to apply pressure here.
that's good. With your fingertips, just like that. Very good.
Reggie, I want you to understand exactly what I'm going to do.
first, I'm going to put you under.
once you're under, I'm going to stop the bleeding, and once that's done,
I'm going to try and remove the glass. All right?
listen, tell my mom I love her.
you tell her that yourself.
you know, I only wanted to become a real scientist.
maybe do some good.
I guess I thought I could handle everything.
things got away from me.
try and relax.
I shouldn't have run.
don't fight it. Just relax.
take a couple of deep breaths.
I have to cut him, Frankie.
it's very difficult to concentrate with you pointing that gun at me.
we can pump in CS gas.
on the west end of the house, there's a vent that leads directly into the lab.
except we're talking about a 14-year-old kid with a gun that he's not afraid to use.
the gas could cause him to panic.
Yeah, one wild shot and he blows up the whole block.
Riley's armed. She's trained for this.
if she gets the opportunity, she will take it.
one thing we got going for us, time is on our side.
I say we trust them.
so do I.
we need more towels.
hand me another hemostat.
okay.
all right. Ready? - Yeah.
and... here we go. - Okay.
Oh, my God! What did you do to him?
I need help. - He's not going to die, is he?
I need someone to put pressure on the artery.
give me the gun.
I need someone to apply pressure to the artery while I make a pressure bandage, Frankie.
I need your hands.
Reggie needs your help. Give me the gun.
come on, do some good for a change.
Frankie, I need you over herenow.
you see where my hand is? Put your hand there. You feel it? You got it?
that's it, right there. Keep the pressure tight. Good.
code Four, suspect's disarmed.
we need an ambulance, Code Three.
have your people treat him fairly, Captain.
he doesn't have to be a lost cause.
somehow, I knew you were going to say that.
I never did get to tell my side of the story.
I was accused to the crime I did not commit.
I was held without bail in the east clark county detention center, waiting trial.
I've never been to jail before, it's not a place you wanna be.
the prosecution called on my cellmate to testify against me.
he told them that I had confessed to the murder of Thomas Harrot.
it was a lie.
in exchange for his testimony, my cellmate got a suspended sentence.
I wanted to take the stand, but my public defender told me it was a bad idea, and I trusted him.
I thought jail was hell.
then I got to the state pen.
I've been there for 18 years.
after being denied parole in 2000, I began studying the law.
I figured if nobody was gonna help me, I had to do it myself.
DNA
and I discovered there were a lot of other innocent men like me in prison.
there were new ways to prove that.
then two years ago, I ran into my cellmate again, and he revealed to me that the testimony against me had been his lawyer's idea.
everybody on the ground!
that's when I discovered that we had the same lawyer
the late Benjamin Tripp, Esquire.
your Honors, my court-appointed lawyer conspired against me, and the county prosecutor just looked the other way.
now, this was more than a conflict of interest. This was collusion.
18 years ago, I was denied my constitutional right to a fair trial.
under the law, I'm entitled to have my day in court.
it was 1991, the night of the Rampart Casino fire.
my first solo.
the victim, Thomas Harrot, called 911 to report an intruder in his house.
he was 91 years old and he lived alone.
first officer on the scene found him down on the floor.
blunt force trauma to the head.
a rock was used to break a window, and that appeared to be the point of entry.
the State Supreme Court has granted Jeremy Kent a new trial.
the standards and documentation have changed substantially since '91, so we're going to reexamine all my old evidence.
the house was demo'd six months ago, but I still have the crime scene sketch, so I can walk you through it.
the house is dark. There's no car out front.
Mr. Harrot hadn't driven since he was 85.
so, to Kent, the place must've looked empty.
well, it says here two nearby houses were also burglarized around the same time.
the first one was on Crawford, and the second one on Skidmore.
lights out. No cars.
and a rock used to break the window.
a witness on Crawford saw a man running down the driveway.
recognized him as a neighborhood kid and picked Kent out of a lineup.
other than the rocks, was there any evidence of Kent at the other two houses?
no. The only physical evidence that led to the suspect was the print on the rock that I found right here.
Kent came here to burg the place.
Yeah, and his plans changed when he ran into Mr. Harrot.
get out of my house!
old man. Half deaf. Half blind.
Mr. Harrot wasn't a threat.
there was no need to kill him.
I always thought that tipped the jury.
did you recover a murder weapon? - No.
but the depression fractures on the victim's skull suggested a hammer.
follow me. So, there's an alley here.
there was obviously a number of shoe impressions that evening, but this particular one was right here.
it was unique because it was fresh and it was facing the fence.
now, Harrot's neighbors reported that their motion light came on.
so, I figured that maybe the suspect jumped the fence.
so, I searched the yard.
I didn't find any shoe impressions on the other side of the fence.
so, all you had was an eyewitness who was a half a mile away, testimony from Jeremy Kent's ex-cellmate, and a single fingerprint from a rock.
back then it was enough.
you got it figured out? Legal just put this on my desk.
I've been subpoenaed by Jeremy Kent.
he's requesting a pretrial conference.
Yeah, he probably wants to talk to you about how he got life based on a rock.
someone tried to get in my house.
are they still there, sir? Sir?
I hear someone in the other room.
I need the police. I'm all alone.
what is your address?
901 West Westcroft. Hurry.
I'm dispatching a unit. Please remain on the phone, sir.
I'll be right back. - No, sir...
I'm going to see who's out there. Be right back.
sir! Stay with me, sir...
when the first officers arrived, the phone was still off the hook.
does that mean we have the murder on tape? - No.
the victim's bedroom faced the street, so all we've got is a lot of sirens passing by.
figure they were going to the fire.
fortunately, audio analysis has come a long way since '91.
be right back. - Play it again.
be right back.
sir? Stay with me, sir...
listen to the low end of the frequency.
does that sound like an engine to you?
Yeah. I think I can isolate and amplify that.
it's closer to the phone than the sirens.
so, it had to be right outside the bedroom.
three minutes into the call?
cops didn't arrive for almost 25.
can you match that engine to a specific make and model?
like the, uh, suspect's 1984 Pontiac 6000?
I can try.
two depressed circular fractures of the frontal skull.
Sam Barnard conducted the autopsy.
minimal documentation.
listed COD as intracranial hemorrhaging.
can we call Dr. Barnard for a consult?
passed away in '98.
loved chili dogs, but his arteries didn't.
all right, two fractured ribs on the left side.
a third fracture on the right, and a dislocation from the vertebral column.
barnard attributed all of these other injuries to the fall after the attack.
that's ridiculous.
a 90-year-old man may have bones like eggshells, but he can't possibly fall on his left side and his right side at the same time.
logic dictates that the thoracic injuries were sustained prior to the head blow.
beaten, then killed.
you couldn't get away with this quality of work today.
I dug up the original ME's notes.
and what did the good doctor have to say about the hairline fractures to the femur and the tibia?
he described them as age-related, osteoporotic degeneration.
they could've just as easily been caused by a struggle.
at the time you investigated the Harrot murder, how long had you been employed by Las Vegas PD?
18 months.
Oh, that's all?
prior to the Thomas Harrot murder, you always worked under a supervisor?
Yes.
so, this case was your first unsupervised investigation?
it was my first solo case.
but all my casework was reviewed by my supervisor.
well, regardless, it was in your best interest to get a conviction?
I don't deal in convictions. That's for the jury.
still... worked out pretty good for you.
better than it did for me. - Is that a question?
Oh, I'm sorry if I'm wasting your time here.
it's just I've been in here for 18 years for something I didn't do.
so, all I've got is time.
you know, I met a drug dealer in here who knew your husband, Eddie Willows.
apparently, he was a very good customer.
I heard he died. My condolences.
I'm sorry, what was the question?
were you taking any drugs, legal or illegal, at the time you were processing this crime scene?
no. - Was it because you were pregnant?
how is your daughter? - How is that relevant?
Oh, I'm laying a foundation.
that's how we refer to it in the legal community.
now, having a child is a life-altering experience.
did your pregnancy influence your judgment? - No.
so, your condition didn't impose any-any limits to the chemicals you could use in processing the crime scene?
no, all the evidence I collected was bagged and tagged, and all the tests were conducted by the experts.
who, like yourself, are all employees of the Las Vegas Police Department and, therefore, inclined to give their employer the answers they want.
I don't trust your lab results.
which is why you can exercise your right to hire the expert of your choosing to reexamine the evidence.
right, at my own expense.
you see, I haven't earned that much money in the last 18 years.
I got the blood exemplar for Thomas Harrot from cold storage, but the lab wasn't doing DNA back then, so Catherine's got to get a buccal sample from the suspect.
what are you looking for?
the blood stains that Catherine analyzed are consistent with the victim, but the lab didn't have ALS until 1995.
so, I'm thinking it's possible that there was an area of non-visible blood from the suspect that Catherine couldn't see.
what does that look like to you?
a giant sperm cell.
maybe a big comma.
Catherine never recovered the murder weapon, but she always suspected that it was a hammer.
speaking of evidence, per the ASCLD regulations, all current evidence examinations must meet the 2009 forensic standards.
you've done your homework.
which brings me to the only physical piece of eviden we have in this case, which is item number CW-2, the rock which you claim you found in Mr. Harrot's living room.
now, I was convicted on a five point of minutia match, which, per ASCLD regulations, is far from conclusive today.
which makes the print more prejudicial than probative.
I maintain that that print belongs to the real killer of Thomas Harrot.
and I am filing a motion with the court to have the rock excluded.
have you got anything else? Yes or no?
employees
Hey, we got a big problem.
bigger than, crime is up, and our budget is down?
Jeremy Kent is filing a motion to throw out the only physical evidence linking him to the crime scene.
Ah, the infamous rock, huh? - Yeah.
ADA says that it could be up to the judge.
was your ridge structure faded or broken?
how strong are your points of identification?
well, strong enough to confirm an ID and get a conviction. - Catherine.
okay. It wasn't a road map. It was a difficult comparison.
then, let's not take a chance on losing this.
Oh, I know. I know. Go back to the rock.
I reexamined the rock.
enhanced the ridge detail in Photoshop, which we didn't have in '91.
I developed a unique pattern within the core and matched it to Kent's ten card print.
is that a smiley face?
you don't see those every day.
he lied. He was there.
I have something, too. It's a theory.
um, we'll need to go back to the scene.
the toe end of the impression was deeper than the heel end, which tells me...
that the toe exerted more pressure than the heel.
which wouldn't have been the case if Kent was just standing here.
how tall is he?
he's about your height.
I can't see over the fence, unless...
I missed that.
the neighbors' motion sensor light went off, right?
Yes.
but you found no evidence of the suspect being in their yard?
right.
yet something had to set it off. Maybe he...
maybe he tossed the weapon.
well, I searched the yard, and I went back the next day and searched it again, and...
the first thing Grissom taught me-- people never look up.
I've seen some crazy stuff in my day, but this has got to take the prize.
smoking hammer in a tree. - Yes.
you remember how tall this tree was back in '91?
I think it was just below the roof line.
jury's never gonna believe this unless we document the hell out of it.
so, let's go back and get the video camera and the chain saw.
I sent a copy of the videotape over to the DA's office.
I think we may have Kent's prints in the victim's blood.
over time, the bark must have encapsulated the prints like a fossil.
ray, if this is the murder weapon, we have Kent dead to rights.
according to Wendy, the blood on the murder weapon was from Thomas Harrot.
it's all coming together.
just give me the results.
I get it. You're a little touchy because you missed something the first time.
murder weapon, which was your whole case.
but, as of now, Catherine Willows, you are a rock star.
am I going to be able to explain this to the jury?
you know, I'm available for court testimony, if need. Okay?
now, first, I chemically tested the metal part of the hammer, and I found ferric oxide.
while not specific, it does indicate that the hammer was exposed to the elements for a long period of time.
next, I documented the growth of the tree around the hammer using photos from the original crime scene, and the photos that you took today.
quercus agrifolia-- desert oak-- grows about six to eight inches a year, which means that your tree probably grew about nine feet in 18 years.
a bark collar grew around the hammer during that period of time, which confirms that the hammer was in the tree for many years.
and therefore, no one can accuse you of planting it.
pardon the pun.
unfortunately, the scientific improbability of getting a viable print or DNA is a completely separate issue, but...
I'll back you.
good to know.
Hey, Catherine. - Did you get any usable prints off the hammer?
Yeah. Two.
neither one of them is a match to Jeremy Kent. - What?
Yeah, I did a visual comparison. Mandy peer reviewed.
I'm sorry, Catherine. It just... It isn't him.
when Kent discovers you found the murder weapon with someone else's prints on it, he's going to fast track himself to an acquittal.
we have the print on the rock, which still puts him at the scene.
but Kent's prints aren't on the hammer.
so, clearly, there was an accomplice who probably committed the murder.
Yeah. Who we still need to identify. - Obviously.
okay, pretrial hearing is in 48 hours.
you're gonna have to reveal the prints then.
it would be nice if Kent would give us a name.
Yeah, well, why would he? He's kept it a secret for 18 years.
then ask without asking. Sweat him with the rock evidence.
the judge denied your motion. The rock's back in play.
I reexamined the rock.
I enhanced the fingerprint and photoed it.
and this time around, I found several highly unique points of comparison, including this happy face pattern.
which is an exact match to your print.
and that print puts you at the crime scene.
you were there. You killed Thomas Harrot.
Mr. Kent, if there's another explanation, other than the obvious, now would be a good time to come clean.
once you're wearing these, nobody believes anything that you have to say.
try me.
I was there, but I didn't kill the guy.
I need to make some fast money.
I broke into those other two houses.
I picked them because it looked like nobody was at home.
the old man's house was my third stop.
I went inside, there's a body on the floor.
I got the hell out of there.
why not just call 911?
Yeah,"Hello, I just broke into a house "and I found a dead body on the floor.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll just wait right here for you.
look, I was a reckless punk and I messed up big-time.
I broke the law. But I did not kill that old man.
somebody else did that.
why didn't you mention this 18 years ago?
because my lawyer advised me not to admit that I was at the scene of the crime.
it was the only honest piece of advice he ever gave me.
you know what would give your story more credibility?
if you could ID the other suspect.
lady, if I would've seen him, that would've been the first thing out of my mouth.
but whoever killed Harrot was long gone by the time I got there.
we're done here.
Oh, sure, yeah. Why would you admit to making a mistake that cost me the last 18 years of my life?
all I want is my life back.
is that asking too much?
Jim. Thanks for coming by. - Sure, you bet.
so, we're all just passengers on the time train.
well, you got that right.
so, you hit a snag.
well, Jeremy Kent now admits that he was at the Harrot house.
and when he got there, the old man was already dead.
I call that "perp fiction.
the problem is, is that his story is consistent with the new evidence I have yet to disclose.
I had this guy pegged as the bad guy the minute I laid eyes on him 18 years ago, and so did you.
what if he's telling the truth?
wrong place, wrong time.
Oh, you gotta tune that out. That's all bull.
all that matters is what you got on him.
now, these guys lie because, well, because they're good at it and because they're hiding something.
and the thing they're hiding is usually the thing that makes them guilty.
a million years ago, uh, back when Eddie and I first started dating, we, uh, went to a party and, um, you know, we drank our fair share and it was time to leave and he tosses me the keys 'cause I'm the responsible one.
so, you know, I'm driving and he starts singing this stupid song, which I've completely blanked from my memory, and one moment I'm just laughing hysterically and the next he has grabbed the wheel from my hands because I almost ran over a man.
and in that moment my life would've changed completely.
because of a bad decision.
so...
what makes me any different than Jeremy Kent?
you know, Eddie was right. You are the responsible one.
and if you had hit that guy, you would've called the cops.
because you would've taken responsibility for your actions.
now, Jeremy Kent is a jailhouse lawyer. He's a scumbag.
his freedom, his whole life depends upon getting you to doubt yourself.
don't let him live rent free in your head.
I need your help. I want to run the case.
the question: Does the evidence support my initial conclusion that Jeremy Kent killed Thomas Harrot?
I'll start.
the print on the rock is even stronger than before.
the broken window was the only sign of forced entry and Kent admits to it.
unknown shoe impression at the victim's yard.
same size but never matched to any of Jeremy Kent's shoes.
that makes it equivocal.
Archie is still working on the 911 tape, trying to match the engine noise to Kent's car.
two unknown prints on the murder weapon.
neither one is a match to Kent.
sounds like that would exclude him.
what if... What if...
he really did kill the old man and a second suspect tossed the hammer over the fence?
an accomplice would make sense.
seven out of ten breaking and entering cases in Las Vegas involve multiple suspects.
that would mean that the second suspect probably touched it last, which is why we only got his prints.
if there was an accomplice, why didn't Kent give him up?
because sometimes there is honor among thieves.
if he knew he was going down, why drag someone else down with him?
I don't know about that.
if any of these guys thought they could cut a deal, they'd roll over on their mother.
I think you're both right.
people are motivated by self-interest.
but there are certain human bonds that trump even our base instincts
love, blood, fear.
right, there's people I love but I wouldn't go to prison for any of them.
my money's on fear.
so, what would Kent have to be afraid of?
he wasn't connected to a gang or organized crime.
what about his family?
he was living on his own. His closest relative was an uncle.
sometimes your friends are your family.
did you check the prison visitor log?
the DA said that he's never had any visitors.
Kent never made it to college.
most of his friends were probably from high school.
okay, I'll call the high school, get his yearbooks, see if any of his old teachers still work there.
we find the accomplice, we find the truth.
Hey, Arch. Got your text.
check this out.
a forensic auto expert sent me over an engine signature database.
so, I compared the noise on the 911 tape to a Pontiac 6000. No match.
that's okay. We have a new theory that Kent had an accomplice.
maybe the car on the tape belongs to him.
well, that explains a lot.
hear that jingling sound?
Yeah, like, uh, keys shaking together.
that's a heat riser from a '60s or '70s-era Dodge engine.
now... from zero to 27 seconds, that jingling is constant.
tells me the car was idling.
maybe one of them went into the house while the other one waited in the car.
look, at 27 seconds, the engine revs up and down.
somebody's hitting the gas.
at 27 seconds, Thomas Harrot was on the phone with the 911 operator saying someone was already in his house.
listen to this.
at two minutes and 45 seconds into the tape, the Dodge revs and drives away.
and then 10 seconds before that...
wait, slow that down. Play it again.
car doors slamming?
two separate doors.
there was definitely two of them.
so, we know at some point they were both out of the car.
question is, were they both in the house?
something about the hammer prints wasn't really sitting right with me, so I reexamined it.
now, the full print on the shaft, that's a no-brainer, that's clearly not Kent's.
but the partial?
that's a different story altogether.
check out the, uh, the top edge here.
that's not print surface, that's regular skin.
I think the suspect was holding the hammer like this.
you can see the inside edge of my pinky is covering the base.
there could've been other prints, but they weren't in blood so they wouldn't have been preserved over time.
you only got a ten card on Kent.
that doesn't include the inside of his fingers.
need to get some major case prints on this guy.
that partial could be his.
thank you, Nick. - You're welcome.
let me guess-- you still go through your high school yearbooks?
like you don't? - I can't. I burnt them.
it was very cathartic.
Oh, look, here he is.
Jeremy Kent and Sabrina Littee.
you know, Archie identified a Dodge from the 911 tape. This could be it.
that's not just any Dodge. That's a '68 Super Bee. Classic muscle car.
we got the license. - Yeah.
okay, the car was registered to an Arthur Littee from 1988 to 1993.
want to bet she's his daughter?
maybe Sabrina took Daddy's car out for a night out on the town.
I'll call Brass.
Hello, young man. I'm a police officer. I'm looking for Sabrina Owen.
Hey, Mom, somebody's at the door!
and tell Sam and Katie to hurry up!
I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
are you Sabrina Owen, used to be Sabrina Littee?
Yes. Can I help you?
Yeah, I'd like to ask you a few questions about Jeremy Kent.
Hey, hey, hey, guys. Uh-uh, slow down.
you're on the pink team. - Sorry.
Yes, yes.
wow, I haven't...
I haven't heard that name in such a long time. - I'll bet.
isn't he, um, isn't he in prison?
well, he's trying to get out. He's been granted a new trial.
I'm just doing some routine follow up.
I know the two of you went to high school together.
what can you tell me about him?
I remember he liked to play up his bad boy rep to impress the girls.
did it work? Did it work on you?
uh, no. No.
I mean, he definitely tried, so.
I mean, the truth is, I didn't really know him that well.
then how come he was driving your father's Super Bee the night he killed Thomas Harrot?
mom! We're going to be late!
just a minute.
okay, look...
Jeremy and I were dating, but nobody knew. We kept it a secret.
Why?
because I wanted it that way. He wasn't my type, and that was the appeal.
you know how it is.
what about the car?
so, yeah, yeah, I-I let Jeremy use the car sometimes.
I didn't know how to say no to him.
where were you the night of the murder?
I was at home with my parents watching news coverage of the Rampart fire.
I'm going to need some contact information on them.
mom, we're going to be late!
just a minute!
mountain View Cemetery, plot 921.
look, I'm sorry.
look, my husband's an attorney.
so, don't talk to me, talk to him.
no, no, I understand. I understand. I totally understand.
listen, this is a, uh... this is a warrant for the Super Bee.
according to the DMV, it's currently registered to you now.
so, we're going to take the car. Enjoy the game.
I think we've got something.
that look like blood?
what are the odds that's window glass from the house?
about the same as finding a hammer in a tree.
the elemental composition of the glass that you found in the car is indistinguishable from the exemplars that you collected 18 years ago.
also...
both had traces of diazinon.
insecticide?
Yes, indeedy. Which was banned in 1999. So...
I'll give you a money-back guarantee that this piece of glass was once part of the victim's living room window.
Hey, I just got your results.
she's fast, but she's thorough.
um, the blood on the glass did not belong to Jeremy Kent.
it was female, and it wasn't in CODIS.
okay, so, we know that Kent and his accomplice both entered the house through the broken window.
didn't the getaway car belong to his girlfriend?
Yeah.
we have DNA that puts your wife at the crime scene.
you were there with Jeremy, weren't you? - Don't answer that.
you better come up with some answers or you're not going anywhere.
Jeremy got me pregnant... - Don't say a word.
listen.
my client was a 16-year-old kid who got mixed up with the wrong guy.
but she got herself straightened out.
we've been married for 15 years. I adopted our son Tyler.
there's no conspiracy here.
and we are here as a courtesy. So, either you charge her or we walk.
who are you-- the lawyer or the husband? Which one is it?
I want to talk.
not until we have an agreement. - No, honey, I want to talk.
Jeremy got me pregnant.
I couldn't tell my parents about the baby.
he said we could move to LA, start over.
we didn't have the money.
he promised me that he was going to get the money and I was naive, you know.
I was naive to believe him.
so you were with him when he robbed those houses?
Sabrina, I am advising you not to say anything else.
I waited in the car.
you didn't wait in the car at Thomas Harrot's house.
I did.
at first.
the house was supposed to be empty.
but then, I heard Jeremy's voice and I knew something was wrong.
so what happened when you went inside?
I saw the old man lying on the floor.
and Jeremy was standing over him holding a hammer.
he was already dead.
we have your fingerprints in blood on that hammer. You're lying.
get out of my house!
I didn't kill him. No, no, no. No.
Jeremy gave me the hammer to throw away.
honey. Honey.
you believe me, don't you?
counselor, why don't you explain to your client the felony murder rule?
why don't you explain it to her?
cause I don't know who you are anymore.
baby... Honey, don't leave me. Honey, please don't leave me.
baby, I'm begging you.
baby, please don't leave me!
Oh, God!
sit down. Relax. Sit down.
Oh, my God!
the felony murder rule states that when a murder is committed, during the commission of a felony, like a burglary, all the participants can be charged with first-degree murder...
regardless of who actually swings the hammer.
let me lay out our case that we have against you and your accomplice.
due to the granting of your new trial, the lab reopened your case.
we found the murder weapon, a claw hammer.
and we found your print on the base of the handle of that hammer.
and we found your accomplice's print in blood on the body of that handle.
we've identified your accomplice as Sabrina Owen, formerly Sabrina Littee...
your girlfriend at the time of the murder.
and she's made a full statement implicating you as the killer of Mr. Thomas Harrot.
you're freaking lying to me.
these are copies of all pertinent documents, as well as a transcript of Mrs. Owen's sworn confession.
I saw the old man on the floor.
Jeremy was standing over him, holding a hammer.
he was already dead.
I can't believe she would do this to me.
Yeah, you protected her for 18 years and she sold you out in five minutes.
I kept my mouth shut so my kid would have a mother.
everything I've done I did for them.
why did you ask for a new trial?
you had to have known that we might find out about Sabrina.
no, I didn't. Not after all this time.
then why?
cause I'm entitled to a fair trial.
but you're still guilty.
I just think it was more than that.
I mean, you've been in here for 18 years, she's been out there with your kid, living a normal life.
I think you just got tired of having to pay for the crime all by yourself.
all I think about in here is that kid who has no idea I even exist.
Sabrina never visited me once. She never wrote.
she never even sent a photo of my girl or boy.
I don't even... I don't even know a name.
your son's name is Tyler.
did Sabrina cut a deal?
no deal. She's been charged. She'll stand trial.
so, she'll testify against me.
that's up to the DA.
well, you tell the DA to make sure that happens.
you're hoping that your son will be there.
might be the only chance I have in my life to see him.
that's not right.
maybe not.
but... you had a choice.
thomas Harrot didn't.
I'm saving my sympathy for him.
is that the expanded tox report?
Yes, it is.
searched 600 metabolites and nothing unusual.
that makes Mr. Kelly our third undetermined in three weeks.
chief coroner's gonna be on my butt. Conduct a review, cut the budget.
I was at the scene. Pretty standard--mother came home, found him convulsing, tried cpr.
no prior history of seizures, only trace amounts of meth in his system, not enough to kill him.
put him in the meat locker next to the other two.
I'm gonna figure this out.
I'm doing you a solid here, doc.
technically, I can't investigate until you rule Mr. Kelly's death either a homicide or suspicious crcs.
I'll give you my tickets to love.
I've seen it, twice.
all right.
I've got a call--I'll meet you up there.
all right!
okay. Sure.
Mrs. Kelly, this is Catherine Willows from the crime lab! We spoke earlier!
Mrs. Kelly? - Yeah?
Mrs. Kelly, I'm, uh, Catherine Willows from the crime lab.
I left you a message.
Catherine! Are you okay?!
thank god.
she jumped me. I pulled my gun and she just collapsed.
she's dead... and you're bleeding.
that's better than the other way around.
so I talked to the neighbors.
nobody had anything bad to say about Mrs. Kelly.
in fact, they all called her a saint.
she's a special ed teacher.
she's a friend to kids, stray dogs, and anybody with a problem.
well, I must have met her evil clone.
you know, there's a reason there's a protocol. You should have callede first.
I was doing this as a favor to doc.
Yeah, this thing could have escalated easily and got out of hand.
next time, you call me.
Yes, you're right.
I'm glad you're okay.
thank you.
how is she?
vitals are stable, but the attacker bit her, and she's not sure when she had her last tetanus shot.
let me see.
I just called you so that you could work the case 'cause I'm a witness.
Nick's already inside.
Catherine, don't be a tough guy.
Jeff, get her to the hospital. - Yes, sir.
evening, professor. - Nick.
extending deep and heartfelt sympathies in the death of your son brent.
Darla kelly's son died six days ago.
thinking that's probably what drove her over the edge.
Las hey, check it out.
found a baggy of meth in brent's dresser and an empty one in the trash can.
looks like he was a tweaker living in mama's trailer.
meth can make you stronger, meaner, angry, paranoid.
maybe she was using, too, which would explain her behavior.
I found her alive but unconscious. Possible sexual assault.
got an id? - No purse, no wallet.
my guys are still knocking on doors.
found her pants and shoes next to the body, and the paramedics took this off her.
who called it in?
uh, Mr. Murphy.
claims that he found her lying under his truck when he was leaving for work.
his wife corroborated his story. We'll see if it holds up.
got some abrasions on the back of the shirt.
couple of buttons missing on the front.
white substance on the pants.
could be semen.
dried blood pool.
she was probably out here for a while.
some blood drops on the box-- mostly horizontal, more than eight inches off the ground.
somebody hit her when she was already down.
maybe she was kicked under the truck.
got a drag trail.
see where it leads.
Mrs. Kelly was such a nice lady.
she lost her health insurance when she went part-time at Marshall Creek Elementary.
poor thing was always getting sick.
the warrant includes her son. Was he a patient here as well?
Brent? Yeah, he came in a few times feigning a back injury.
why is that, you think?
he was trying to score some oxycodone.
a couple weeks ago, Dr. Shaw had to forcibly remove him. - Really?
I have his file, too.
he was a terrible human being.
I used to suspect that he was abusing his mother, but when I asked Mrs. Kelly about it, she clammed right up.
it says that Mrs. Kelly called the clinic three days ago complaining of flu-like symptoms, and someone told her to take an analgesic and get some rest. Does that sound right?
do you think that contributed to her death?
I don't know yet, but I'm gonna find out.
I woke up this morning And all my shrimp was dead I woke up this morning Ooh, all my shrimp was dead.
dead Shrimp Blues-- Robert Johnson.
recorded Friday, November 27, 1936, San Antonio, Texas.
the Gunter Hotel, three blocks from the Alamo. You're a blues man?
is fat meat greasy?
I got this record in Chicago at the MEs' convention.
guy let it go for 50 bucks.
the man didn't know what he had.
is that the tox report? - Yes.
no drugs in her system. Henry ran the panel twice.
I don't get it.
this is my fourth undetermined this month.
Mrs. Kelly lived with her son.
maybe you're looking for some kind of pathogen.
something infectious-- a virus, bacteria, microorganism?
I've already ruled out gonorrhea, viral hepatitis, syphilis, staphylococcus, atypical pneumonia, meningitis, endocarditis, influenza, West Nile, and SARS.
then it has to be an exotic.
did you hold the rest of the bodies?
walk this way.
brent Kelly, 22, died Friday night after an unexplained seizure.
Leeland Jacobs, 33, ex-con, died alone in his apartment two weeks ago.
says here he displayed aggressive behavior prior to his death.
found cocaine in his system, but he didn't OD.
depending upon your genetic disposition, cocaine can trigger schizophrenia and heart failure.
it wasn't a heart failure.
I can't tell you if he was schizo.
we couldn't find any medical records.
Scotty Belinsky. 27.
died three weeks ago. Found in his bathroom. Another ex-con.
I had Brass run backgrounds on Belinsky and Jacobs.
no apparent connections.
well, do we know if either of them was connected to Brent Kelly?
no. The only thing that brings these three men together is body modification.
I see Mr. Kelly had eagauges.
but you ain't seen nothing yet.
help me roll him.
that is some serious modification.
transdermal implants.
it's done via a process called "dermal punching.
the technician makes an incision, separates subcutis and fascia using a dermal elevator, creating a pocket where an implant's inserted,
typically steel or silicone bead.
the skin fuses around the bead, creating the design, kind of like a Braille tattoo.
so, maybe...
all three of these men visited the same tattoo parlor.
can't many of them that do this kind of work.
so, you want me to take care of that?
Hey, Lou, did you do a knock and talk at this house?
I'm just on my way over there now.
LVPD. - Yeah, uh... What's going on?
ladies, I'm Detective Vartann.
this is Greg Sanders from the Crime Lab.
a woman was attacked on your street last night.
we believe the victim might have come from this house.
Oh, my God. Kayla. She was here last night.
is, uh, this Kayla?
is she okay?
she's in the hospital.
what is Kayla's last name?
when was the last time you saw her?
around 10: 00. We had our diet club meeting, me, Diana, and Kayla.
you know, we all entered the GME bikini contest.
GME? - God Made 'Em.
no fake boobs.
first prize is a trip for two to Hawaii. - Yeah.
well, we meet here twice a week.
we do our weigh in, and then we have our support dinner.
so, I lost another twpounds.
I was craving ice cream, but I went for a run instead. And it worked.
rub it in, why don't you? I lost zero pounds this week.
I'm never going to fit into my bikini.
don't say that. We can do this.
and I am going to go to Maui.
if you win, will you take me?
you said that Kayla left here around 10: 00.
did either of you walk her to her car?
I was going to drive her home, but then it stopped raining so she decided to walk.
they say if you walk after dinner it burns more fat.
Yeah. Um, do you know anyone who might want to hurt her?
her ex... BF.
Yeah, they fought all the time. D-bag.
he dumped her 'cause she gained 15 pounds.
and then he said that he would take her back if she won the contest and took him to Hawaii.
do you know her ex-BF's name?
tetanus shot hurt more than the crazy lady attacking me.
you going to turn into a vampire now?
well, I already work nights, so I don't think anybody's going to notice.
I can't work the other case, so fill me in here.
doctor says death is imminent.
wet mount was positive for semen.
and they found signs of sexual trauma.
do you want to help me roll her?
she's got road rash on her back, shoulders, and buttocks.
based on the depth of the abrasions, it looks like she was dragged a long way.
that's consistent with what we found at the scene.
now, this neck injury looks like a stab wound.
you swab it?
nurse did. Found some trace inside the wound track.
it's with the S. A.E. kit.
excuse me!
he does know you can't undo that. Doesn't he?
self-mutilation trips me out.
it's a form of rebellion.
I've witnessed a couple of botched tongue forkings in my time.
Yeah, and even if you make it through, you wind up with a...
speech impediment.
Hey, guys. Walk-ins always welcome.
we're actually running a special right now on matching tattoo hearts.
or are you guys more into rough trade?
dude, we're CSI.
we're here on police business.
are you the owner? - I wish.
it's Jack's Body Shop, and my name is Eric.
I'm the manager slash receptionist.
the man-ceptionist.
we need to speak with Jack.
Jack is in the back making one of his magic potions.
thank you, my man.
boy, this is all kinds of wrong.
bathroom's in the front.
are you Jack?
crime Lab boys.
Dr. Jack Shaw. What can I do for you, gentlemen?
are you the same Dr. Shaw that works the free clinic on Janville?
guilty.
I assume you also know I'm a retired coroner from Reno.
I do now.
so, how'd you go from being a coroner to owning this place?
natural transition, actually.
used to spend all day cutting up dead bodies and sticking them with needles.
today when I cut 'em they bleed.
tell me, Doctor, do you know if any of these men has been in your shop recently?
I don't recognize the faces, but I do know the work.
there's sunflower yellow and iris blue in these tats.
that's "Van Gogh." He mixes his own ink.
and he's the only one that does dermal implants.
what's his real name?
Carl Van Goe. Spelled G-O-E.
I swear to God. Had it legally changed.
I fired him two weeks ago.
how come? - Artistic differences.
customer would want a certain design.
van Goe would give them what he thought was right for their "canvas."
you guys going to tell me what's going on?
these three men all died of an infectious disease.
seems that this place-- your shop-- is the only common link.
Hey, I run a clean shop.
I give an antibiotic shot to anybody that's had an invasive procedure.
but Van Goe brings his own tools and needles.
we'd like to check him out.
in the meantime, we're going to need your tools, needles, inks, and, uh, the biohazard bin.
supply cabinet's up front. Biohazard's out back.
it's all in the warrant.
uh, what pathogen do you suspect?
did I say it was a pathogen?
retired coroner. I'm assuming.
so, Elvis, how'd you get these injuries?
I'm a landscaper.
got a lot of cactus orders 'cause of the drought.
or maybe they were from when you raped your ex, Kayla Nootens.
I didn't rape Kay. We had sex.
open up.
you had the kind of sex where e said "no.
hold up. This is crazy. Me and Kay broke up.
Yeah. Because you thought she was fat.
you ever seen her?
she used to look like a little coke bottle.
then she got all messy in the middle.
I couldn't have that on my arm.
so, when Kayla dropped a few lb's, you wanted her back?
no, remember, he wanted a free trip to Hawaii. - Oh, right.
that's why I had sex with her. Sealed the deal.
she was easy that way. And I needed a vacay.
what time was this? - Around 6: 00 maybe.
then she went to go see some friends.
and I had to go pick up my new girlfriend's kid from day care.
where did you go after?
I dropped the kid off, but my girlfriend was tired. So I went home.
well, that means you don't have an alibi.
why do I need an alibi for?
because I'm charging you with the rape and murder of Kayla Nootens.
Congratulations.
you may have just won a 20-year vacay.
Hello, this is-- Don't say "hello.
okay. This is the first solo autopsy of Assistant Medical Examiner David Gregory Phillips.
me.
decedent is a Caucasian female. Kayla Nootens.
early 20s. 63 inches. 144 pounds.
I don't have COD yet, so please don't ask.
you want some help? - No.
I have to do this myself. It's my first solo.
sorry. Didn't mean to lose my temper.
that was you losing your temper?
my wife calls me a "snapping alligator.
well, your bad temper is better than my good one.
did you examine her neck wound?
of course I did. She was stabbed.
I excised that from the wound.
what is it? - I have no idea. Maybe you could ask Hodges.
so, Mr. Van Goe, how come you still have both your ears?
got the name 'cause I cut off someone's ear lobe.
accident. It was my first year on the job.
of course.
so, where do you keep all your tools?
no, hey, hey, hey. Where do you think you're going?
stuff's in there.
no. He'll go look.
I need you to stay here and paint me a picture.
did you do any work on these guys at Jack's Body Shop?
I don't know. Why don't you ask Jack? I quit.
so, you telling me that Shaw didn't fire you?
he's a jackal and a philistine. I quit.
I took my clients with me.
I'm going to need a list of your clients.
I don't write anything down.
excuse me, Mr. Van Goe.
you been working out of your shed these days?
you do know that's against the law, don't you?
okay, let's start again. Did you work on any of these guys?
either here, there, or anywhere?
maybe.
no, this is not multiple choice. It's either yes or no.
or.
okay, it's gonna be one of those days, I guess.
all right, look, Scotty, wrap him up. Come on, let's go.
we'll do this some other place.
damn it.
virology results from the tattoo parlor.
no detectable contaminants, poisons or pathogens.
maybe something will turn up in the Van Goe shed.
can we go over it one more time?
Yeah.
starting with the most recent victim.
Darla Kelly gave her dying son C. P.R.
three days later she complains of a sore throat, fatigue and a low grade fever.
three days after that, she attacks Catherine and drops dead.
right, her counts are normal, white blood cells unaffected.
which tells us it's not bacterial.
if it's not in the blood, it has to be the tissue.
certain organisms have different rates of crossing the blood-brain barrier.
histology was negative.
muscle, tissue, brain, organs.
but the Lab only checked for common pathogens.
let's take a look at Darla Kelly's brain tissue.
bottom right quadrant.
is that a Negri body?
that's what I'm thinking.
I haven't seen one of those since medical school.
I have another one here, Doctor.
there are Negri bodies in each victim's brain tissue.
it's rabies. - Yes.
no one's died of rabies in Nevada in over 90 years.
and now we have four in a month.
rabies would explain Darla Kelly's flu-like symptoms.
it was raining that night.
rabies can cause hydrophobia, intense fear of water.
maybe it triggered heviolent behavior.
and rabies is carried in the saliva.
Mrs. Kelly had a cold sore.
the virus travels through connective tissue into the muscle, goes up into the neuronal cells of the brain stem and into the limbic cortex.
the most common form of rabies virus transmission is through the bite or the virus-containing saliva of an infected host, which is almost always a rabid animal.
now, none of the victims had bite marks.
and no one reported being bitten.
someone was bitten.
what's wrong?
uh, we have C. O.D. on Darla Kelly.
it's rabies.
okay, uh, so, what? I'll get a shot and be fine.
human rabies cases are very rare.
the treatment is extremely expensive.
which is why the state doesn't have any available.
okay, so, you're telling me that there aren't any available shots in the entire state of Nevada?
if the treatment is administered within the first 72 hours of transmission, you should be fine.
it's already been more than 24.
and we've located a supply, it's in Atlanta.
Atlanta?
Georgia.
you'll need a test to confirm whether you've got it.
and I'm taking you to the hospital right now.
I-I need to call Nick. Let him know he's the acting supervisor.
use your cell phone.
at least give me a hint.
I wish I could.
but Dr. Robbins has to review and sign off on my work first.
okay, well, where is he?
the hospital. Visiting Catherine.
he must be feeling really guilty.
okay, the rape victim was dragged.
go.
okay, uh, decedent sustained a half-inch deep stab wound to the right side of her neck.
it nicked her vertebral artery.
C. O.D. is exsanguination.
this wound is minor, David.
she's a young woman.
blood would have clotted within minutes.
Yes, sir, however, I discoved that she was severely anemic and had excessive levels of caffeine in her system.
both of which contributed to blood thinning and compromised her clotting factors.
common indicators of anorexia.
or extreme dieting.
her and her friends were trying to win a bikini contest.
so, my proposed C. O.D. is exsanguination with additional complicating factors preventing clotting.
well described.
I concur.
Catherine just got her prophylaxis shots.
she's doing fine.
that's good to hear.
what have you got?
well, virology confirmed that all four victims died of a, uh, rabies virus variant associated with T. Brasiliensis.
the Mexican Free Tailed Bat.
we didn't find any evidence of bats at the mobile home park.
and two of the victims died in apartments off the strip.
so, what's our theory?
I mean, did all these people go spelunking in Lehman Caves or what?
they charge admission there.
so, I checked their guest books and their receipts.
none of our victims were there.
I called C. D.C.I asked for all their files on rabies transmissions.
most of it was, uh, straight up, huntebitten by fox stuff.
but this one did stand out.
that's redacted.
that usually means there was a lawsuit with a confidential settlement.
doc Robbins says there hasn't been a rabies death in Nevada in nearly a century.
but from what I can piece together, that may not be true.
a patient up in Reno tested positive for rabies after a liver transplant.
but doesn't say if she died or not.
if her liver was infected, she's dead.
if the donor was local, that means that the Reno Coroner had to clear the body before they could harvest the organs.
I guess he must've missed it.
Yeah.
what about Dr. Shaw? He's a coroner.
I know this happened three years ago.
I don't know how many they had working in Reno back then, but we do know him.
brent Kelly, Scott Belinsky and Leeland Jacobs all went to this guy's tattoo parlor.
and both the Kellys were treated by him at the Free Clinic.
your victim was a messy eater. Not too proficient with a fork.
the white substance on the clothes is not semen.
it's potatoes, butter, milk and a pinch of garlic.
mashed potatoes?
she was cheating on her diet.
more like a food orgy.
the trace on the neck wound showed apple, cinnamon and grease.
what about the fragment David extracted?
well, that would be the main course. It was animal bone.
although it was too small for me to identify the species, I think we know it's pretty obvious.
babe.
Wilbur?
pork.
Yes, the other white meat.
that's the only type of flesh that you would season that way.
suddenly, I'm very hungry.
break time.
hold on there, spuds.
how much do you weigh?
uh, excuse you.
that's not public information.
I'd say a buck 45.
same as our victim.
we know Kayla Nootens was dragged face up because her back was abraded.
so, if the killer dragged her like this...
her back wouldn't be abraded.
right.
okay, what if the killer dragged her like this?
easy, killer.
Hodges' calves are touching the floor.
vic had no abrasions from the knees down.
there must've been two of them.
Yep. Elvis had a friend.
uh, if I may?
wouldn't two men, one of whom being a cactus-hauling desert landscaper, just be able to pick me up and carry me?
or... her?
first rule of diet club...
don't talk about diet club.
the whole thing was Rhonda's fault.
she was sabotaging Kayla's diet because she'd lost the most weight.
that is so not true!
Kayla was fatter than me.
so, of course she lost more weight.
anyway, Kayla is the one that started it.
these mashed potatoes are amazing.
what kind of butter substitute did you use?
mine suck.
yours are watery.
Oh, my God.
you bitch!
you are the bitch!
you were going to ditch me for your ugly ex-bf and take him to Hawaii!
you're both bitches!
Kayla would still be alive if Rhonda hadn't whipped that pork chop at her.
you are going to jail!
and you will always have a fat ass!
Rhonda lost it, chased her down.
she dropped dead right there.
I didn't know that you could kill somebody with a pork chop.
but it was Diana's idea to drag the body under the truck and then pin the whole thing on Elvis.
Kayla wasn't dead when you were kicking her under the truck.
she bled to death because you left her there.
I'm telling you, I didn't kill anybody.
okay, we got it, Doc, let's go.
want me to call your girlfriend?
Hey, hey, hey! Back off, back off.
Hey, I got your back, I believe you! Stay strong.
Hey, take it easy.
call 9-1-1.
Hey, bud. Hey, bud.
did I just pass out again?
stay, stay back.
how you feeling?
I'm fine. I just...
I haven't been feeling too good since I got my nipples pierced.
Dr. Shaw gave me a shot of antibiotics, but I probably just got an infection anyway.
when did you get the shot?
a couple days ago.
I don't know-- it's a setup. I'm being framed.
who framed you? Roger Rabbit?
maybe Van Goe. He's a crazy bastard.
he threatened me when I fired him.
so, how does this frame-up play out?
van Goe breaks into your shop wearing a Dr. Shaw mask and pokes Tobin with a rabid needle?
I'm not denying I gave Eric an antibiotic shot.
he had a piercing-- that's SOP at my shop.
you know, somebody's lying in this room.
and it's not me, and it's not him,'cause he just got here.
three years ago in Reno, a transplant recipient died from a donor liver that tested positive for rabies.
I was the ME on the donor's autopsy.
I ruled it a natural.
there was an investigation. I was cleared.
rabies detection is not part of the organ review.
so, this isn't your first dance around the rabies game.
did you give the donor an antibiotic shot, too?
the victim's family later admitted that he had been bitten by a raccoon six weeks before he died.
well, maybe Rocky Raccoon framed you.
I'd like to end this interview and call a lawyer.
miss Schiff?
can I help you with something?
uh, no, but I think I can help you.
I found this in the trash at Dr. Shaw's house.
what were you doing at his house?
Mr. Stokes, I'm... embarrassed to admit it, but we were dating.
I-I didn't see it. I had no idea that he's this monster.
I saw him take it out of his briefcase.
these are the same bags we use at the clinic.
I don't think it belongs to a patient.
did you ask him about it?
he gets angry if I ask him any questions.
just please don't tell him that I gave it to you.
all right.
Thanks.
I need to know what this is, and then get the bag to prints right away.
well, it looks like it's some kind of tissue.
Yeah, you might want to double-glove.
I think Dr. Shaw's been cutting up rabid animals, making some sort of a rabies potion.
I will sample DNA and run a species determination.
also, I found Eric Tobin's needle, and virology confirmed that it tested positive for rabies.
any DNA on the syringe? - Yeah.
I just don't know if it's a match to Shaw yet 'cause Langston just dropped off the exemplar on his way out of town.
out of town?
did you tell Nick what we're doing?
I did not tell Nick what we were doing, just in case things don't go according to plan.
gives him plausible deniability.
correct.
you know, we're kind of screwed if the hospital doesn't have hard copies of the documents.
good thing being a doctor has more advantages than just getting hot chicks.
is that Mississippi John Hurt?
no.
recorded January, 1932.
Grafton, Wisconsin.
shoot me a title.
my dear doctor, we are traveling to Reno on the Gone Dead Train.
king Solomon Hill.
born... - Joe Holmes.
thank you.
uh, Frank, how are you today?
never seen you guys before.
are you attendings or surgeons?
we're researchers.
Yeah, we're from, uh, Saint Ann's.
uh, we're doing research for the, uh... for the cardinal.
not the, uh, team in Arizona. The, uh, guy who wears the pointy red hat, cardinal.
medical IDs, please.
you're not allowed to remove any files from this room, photocopy any files without permission, mutilate or destroy any files.
got it...
ebony and Ivory?
Yeah, we... we got it, Frank.
next time, you don't talk.
I don't talk? I don't think you should talk.
so, we have a liver transplant.
recipient was Sandra Williams.
this patient did well immediately after transplantation.
discharged on postoperative day five.
21 days after transplant, she was readmitted with tremors, lethargy and anorexia.
during the next 48 hours, her mental status deteriorated.
she subsequently died. Initial diagnosis was encephalitis.
well, it says here that the recipient's husband, Eric Tobin, filed a lawsuit against the hospital and its medical personnel.
not surprising.
did you say Eric Tobin?
it's, uh, Jack's Body Shop, and my name is Eric-- Eric Tobin.
what, you don't think he's some sort of mastermind that framed Dr. Shaw, do you?
I mean, come on, Ray, you met him.
he's not even the master of his own mind.
he has motive, Nick.
he blames Shaw for his wife's death.
Tobin won a malpractice suit. That's big bucks.
the only reason he'd work at the shop is for revenge.
well, gentlemen, all of the physical evidence points to Dr. Shaw.
Wendy found his touch DNA on the syringe that infected Tobin.
and while you two were out playing Smokey and the Bandit, his girlfriend, who's also a nurse at the clinic, brought me something he was trying to get rid of:
a salivary gland from a rabid bat.
I think that's what he used to make the virus.
rabid bats are easy to spot because they stay within reach even when a human enters their cave.
all he had to do was extract the saliva and add a preservative to keep the rabies virus viable.
look, I don't know how Tobin plays into all this, but Shaw is still our best suspect.
besides, it takes technical skill and knowledge to extract the rabies virus like that.
then, Tobin isn't working alone.
he's partnered with a mastermind.
you said Shaw's girlfriend is a nurse, and she brought you that evidence.
I'm suspicious of anybody who brings me anything.
I ran Susan Schiff through the system.
she could still be lying.
maybe there's another connection.
did Susan Schiff live in Reno?
run her Social.
also known as Susan Williams.
the woman who died in Reno...
her name was Sandra Williams.
my daughter was on the transplant list for a year.
sandy was so excited when her name finally came up.
she and Eric started planning for their future.
she wanted to have a baby.
but because of Dr. Shaw and his negligence, what she got was 21 days of hell.
you ever seen somebody die of rabies?
I've seen people die all kinds of ways.
I understand he made a fatal mistake-- I really do,
but that doesn't give you the right to kill four innocent people.
those men weren't innocent.
they were a different kind of virus.
I told you when we met, Brent Kelly was a low-life drug dealer who beat up his own mother.
and the other two, Eric chose.
those guys would come into the shop and brag about selling drugs to kids and having sex with minors.
where were you guys?
you know, I'm a little confused, Batman.
was your mission to avenge your wife's death or rid Gotham of scumbags?
what about Darla Kelly? She was innocent.
I thought you liked her.
that one's on Brent.
I always knew he'd kill her someday.
what about your son-in-law?
I volunteered.
you hadn't arrested Shaw yet.
plus... Sue wasn't going to let me die.
I'm not stupid.
not anymore.
how did you pull it off?
I got a piercing.
I knew that Dr. Shaw would give me a shot of antibiotics.
that's his SOP.
sue gave me a vial of the virus.
I slapped on a label.
Susan, you don't get to play God because your daughter died.
that's not the way it works.
Dr. Shaw didn't just kill my little girl.
he killed my whole family.
my sons, my parents, my marriage.
we all died that day.
and Dr. Shaw didn't lose anything.
and that's just wrong.
you wanted to see me.
wanted to thank you.
what for?
for believing in my innocence.
I just didn't assume you were guilty.
you know, I was good-- really good-- at my job.
I just wasn't good enough.
I understand, Doctor.
I've been there.
Catherine, I know you got rabies, but at least it solved the case.
remember that solid you owe me?
it's going to take more than show tickets, isn't it?
Oh, yeah.
come on, do another one.
go for it. It's all you.
okay, here it goes.
that's what I'm talking about.
what are you doing?
dancing.
with your tongue? Total lesbo.
don't be a buzzkill.
you're wasted. So?
so...
so I'm two shots behind.
: well, let's get you some, baby!
: drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!
drink! Drink! Drink!
Whoo!
Whoo!
what do you have, Frank?
abandoned car, missing girl.
girl's name is Sarah Jennings.
what do we know about Sarah?
kid from Georgia.
just turned 18.
was here with her class for a trip to the Bahamas.
boat was due to leave this morning.
she never made it.
her friend went looking for her and found her car.
that the friend? Yeah.
name is, uh...
she gave us a picture of the missing girl.
she's pretty.
what about parents?
we've been in touch.
they're on their way to Miami as we speak.
we've also got blood on the inside of the back window.
I noticed that. It's transfer.
we also have a blood trail leading away from the car.
vomit.
looks like things took a wrong turn here.
it's not looking too good, Horatio.
on the contrary. There is a chance this girl is alive...
and we are going to find her.
we don't get fooled again Don't get fooled again No, no.
you call in the cadaver dogs?
those are rescue dogs, Eric.
officer.
we get anything that belonged to the victim yet? We're about to find out.
I found something in Sarah's hotel room.
it's her favorite top.
all right, look, we get a hit on anything,
I'll get ahold of you. Appreciate it.
so do you think that will help?
it's going to help.
you're a good friend.
I should've never left her at that club.
you left the club about 2: 00 a. m?
Yeah, 2: 00.
I already told the detective.
well, timelines vary in the excitement.
no, I'm sure.
when I took off, Sarah was at the bar.
okay. Thank you.
Caine: Mr. Wolfe.
found an earring.
looks like the same kind as we saw in the missing girl's photo.
means we might have her DNA.
you get any prints?
couple of juicy latents inside.
check out the outside of the driver's window. I see that.
that's a handprint.
somebody was watching her.
in more ways than one.
pop that trunk, please.
Hmm...
look at that.
see, that receiver right there, Mr. Wolfe, is attached to that hidden camera in the rearview.
a mobile spy camera?
what do we know about this car?
two things
teenagers aren't usually allowed to rent cars, and this one's registered to Oceanward Travel.
okay, so you call them, make a reservation, and I'll pay a visit.
she's missing?
and she was driving one of your rental cars.
you have to understand our business.
we provide students with the ultimate travel experience.
we take care of our kids, but we never break the law.
valid license.
says she's 18.
she was a minor who's disappeared on your watch.
ms. Jennings shouldn't have even been out last night. Why is that?
the kids sign a behavior contract with our travel agency.
and she was already on probation for a curfew violation from two nights ago.
so you installed that camera to ensure that she made curfew.
beg your pardon?
there is a surveillance camera in the rearview mirror of that car, Mr. Griffith.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
maybe picking up a little extra cash selling underage sex tapes.
you kidding me?
somebody installed the camera and the car is registered to you.
: Oh... look,
I'll help you guys, okay?
any way I can.
I'm sorry she's missing, but I-I did not plant a camera and I had nothing to do with her disappearance.
okay? Nothing.
so what do you think about the spy camera, Brayne?
well, the web camera on the mirror transmitted the feet to the laptop in the trunk, then transmitted the feed out via wireless modem.
can you determine who was receiving the signal?
I'm sorry, I left that seminar at the lunch break.
but I paged the resident computer geek, and he says he's on his way.
do you have anything you can show me?
let's see.
here's all the video recovered from Sarah's rental car.
check it out, this is from last night.
who's the guy?
whoever he is...
she is wasted.
what does that have to do with anything?
it's her car, it's her backseat, you throw in a lot of booze...
she put herself in a compromising position.
a woman always has the right to say no.
I know that.
I'm just saying she made herself a target.
she was a teenager.
And?
you add alcohol, hormones to the mix, you can get a pretty out-of-control kid.
wow, he's pissed.
they're in some sort of an argument.
one thing's clear-- we have to find him.
picture's grainy.
let's get a still of the guy anyway.
we checked you out, Brad.
the bouncers at Liquid Neon say you're out clubbing seven nights a week.
so?
I like to have a good time.
the girl in this picture's missing.
Yeah.
I heard about it on the radio.
bummer.
but we just made out in her car.
no, I'm old enough.
wolfe: So, uh...
how do you explain all that blood we found in the car?
you tell me, you're the detectives.
actually, we're CSIs.
and we have a warrant to collect your DNA.
I could've saved you the time.
the blood's mine.
chick elbowed me in the nose.
Oh, my God, are you kidding?!
and then you got mad and you dragged her out of the car.
wasn't me, man.
who was it?
beats me.
some crazy stalker guy shows up, starts screaming at her to get out of the car.
it was insane.
man: What are you doing there?!
Oh, no. Ouch!
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?!
man: Okay, guy, you get out of here.
come on, leave her alone.
right. So did you get a good look at this "crazy stalker guy"?
the chick almost broke my nose.
I couldn't deal. I got out of there.
that's the truth, straight up.
we'll see just how straight up it is.
put your hands on the screen.
we need your prints.
not like that.
like this.
prints not a match.
Brad was telling the truth.
at least about that.
I'll have patrol keep some eyes on him.
in the meantime, we have a possible stalker out there whose handprints match these.
we better get on it.
Horatio, you got a minute?
is it regarding Sarah Jennings? No.
sorry, but it's going to have to wait.
I think you're gonna want to hear about this.
file appeared on my desk, old murder case, except the file's different than ours and the numbers don't match anything in our system.
how does it relate to me?
you're listed as the arresting officer.
what are the first two numbers on that case file, please?
uh... 95.
okay.
I want you to do me a favor and lay that on my desk and I will take care of it.
okay. Whatever you say.
thank you, ma'am.
Yeah, Jennifer.
Yes, Horatio Caine.
well, um...
that day that we talked about has arrived.
what I want you to do is just stay in the house until you hear from me.
Oka... I understand.
just wait for my call.
officer Jessop.
Yes, Lieutenant.
how would you like to make some overtime?
sure.
there's a young lady I know and her life may be in danger.
witness or victim?
she's both.
what's her name? Her name is Jennifer Wilson.
she lives at 720 Bayside Road.
you see or hear anything, you let me know.
you can count on me, sir. Good.
Paula: Lieutenant.
sir, I've just heard over the radio there's some action down at the beach, near Liquid Neon.
it's about your missing girl.
I'm on my way.
did you get something?
we had the dogs working her scent.
canvassed the entire neighborhood and found this.
it's an I. D.
it's Sarah's.
she's still alive.
why do you say that?
woman jogging said she saw a girl matching Sarah's description drop the purse.
she said the girl looked agitated, disoriented.
how long ago?
not even half an hour.
she's out there.
Yeah, but in which direction?
Yeah.
did you get something?
Yeah.
Yeah, the stain on the outside of the purse I don't know what it is-- I'll get it to Trace.
but I found this pill inside the pocket.
it's stamped. It's Adderine.
pharmaceutical grade.
attention deficit disorder?
her medical history didn't say anything about ADD so no doctor gave her this drug.
you're exactly right, but you know what, Eric?
I know who did.
a drug dealer?
okay, now you're just insulting me.
Adderine, Mr. Griffith, is an amphetamine and a prescription drug.
getting kids high part of the "ultimate experience
you were talking about?
help us out here, Griffith, she could still be alive. Help us out here.
Caine: Here's what I'm going to do, Mr. Griffith.
I'm going to speak to some of Sarah's friends and see what else you put in those vacation packages.
tourism is cutthroat.
all right? We needed an edge, so I-I sold her a little pick-me-up.
if we find her dead, that's going to be on you. Hey, I can't help it if the kid had vices. Frank, why don't you start the process on Mr. Griffith, please.
griffith: Hannah, get ahold of my wife.
give her the keys to the agency.
tell her to lock up.
I'll get ahold of her when all this gets straightened out.
right away, Mr. Griffith.
hang on a second.
you were at the beach this morning, ma'am, weren't you?
no.
Oh, yes, you were.
those needles around your feet are from bottle brush trees where you hid Sarah's purse.
right?
Ted made me do it.
he said to make sure there was a witness.
I asked her, all right?
I found it at the club, and then she disappears.
how's that make me look?
it makes you look guilty.
here's the good news.
now you have company.
stand up, ma'am.
let's go.
Hey. Hey.
Horatio says you were running Trace on the purse.
Yeah, the stain on the outside is a mixture of ethanol, rose oil and honey.
it's rose-honey vodka.
it's a floral alcohol.
it's a new thing in clubs.
they call it Red Bayou.
I've never heard of it.
that's because Red Bayou doesn't go in stores until next month.
guess where the company's test marketing it?
the club where Sarah was last seen.
miss Nordoff, I understand you're the sales rep for Red Bayou in the southern states.
that's correct.
Sarah Jennings is missing.
the club owner said you were with her for most of the night.
it's my job to make sure someone like Sarah is into our drink.
someone like Sarah?
young, friendly, hot.
she was like a walking billboard.
Oh! Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
that's okay.
go for it. It's all you, girl.
okay. Here goes!
viral marketing, that's your tactic.
I hate that term.
I create trends.
you used Sarah.
I supplied a service.
regardless. Your new beverage is about to get some very bad publicity.
it would be to your benefit to tell us everything you remember about Sarah from last night.
I told you-- she was popular.
guys were all over her.
one said he wanted to take her out on his boat.
do you remember his name?
Oh, man.
there's so many.
something Marshall.
said he sailed out of...
I need you to write down the names of any guys you might remember from last night.
I may have something.
the dock master said there was a boat registered to Jeff Marshall in subrange 28.
so where's Jeff?
I don't know.
you in there?
serious, dude, let me grab a couple things and I'll meet you...
Horatio. Yeah.
take a look.
I, uh, gotta call you back.
Hey, Jeff?
TRIPP: Miami Dade Police!
Jeff, why don't you join us?
come on.
Yeah, I'm Jeff Marshall.
TRIPP: Looked like you were about to bust out in a 40-yard dash.
I have a problem with authority.
you also have a problem with Sarah Jennings.
who?
you had here last night.
there were a bunch of girls here last night.
how do you explain this, Jeff?
TRIPP: Deja vu.
more vomit.
you trying to hide something, sport?
it's mine. It happened last week.
bad shellfish.
TRIPP: You been wearing those jeans all week, too?
I want some answers, right now.
I want my lawyer.
you can contact your lawyer on the way downtown.
man: They said I would find you here.
Where's my daughter?!
What'd you do with her? Take it easy. Mr. Jennings.
you can't be here right now. It's all over the news!
is this the guy? Is this him? That's the guy.
I'll kill you myself, you understand? With my bare hands!
Mr. Jennings, listen to me.
now, I want to find Sarah as much as you do, but I need your help.
where are you staying? At the Stonemoor Hotel.
my wife and I are setting up a command post.
go back to your hotel and wait for my call.
I'll take care of this, all right?
all right. Okay?
okay. Fine, go ahead and do that.
I'll call you.
go ahead.
Mr. Marshall?
I can prove that Sarah Jennings was on your boat this morning.
don't say anything, Jeff.
where is she?
to say anything, Lieutenant, would suggest consciousness of guilt.
gentlemen, a young lady might be out there struggling for her life.
every seconds counts.
come on, all you have is a girl who drank too much.
throw a rock on Collins, you'll find dozens more.
Mmm. Where is she?
where is she, Jeff?
look... when Sarah and her friend, Tina, left my boat, they were fine.
what time was that?
around 5: 00 this morning.
what happened after that, I have no idea.
Mm. That's a start.
have you seen my friend?
h-have you seen my friend?
have you seen my friend?
have you?
you lied to me.
lie?
you told me you left Sarah at the club at 2: 00 a. m.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, Jeff Marshall says you were on his boat with her until 5: 00 a. m.
is that true?
we totally broke the behavior contract.
drinking, popping pills, hanging with those guys.
look...
I was afraid they wouldn't let me go on the Bahamas trip.
Where'd you go after the boat?
I don't know. I don't remember.
Tina. Really. I was so drunk.
I passed out somewhere.
when I woke up, Sarah was gone.
I tried to look for her.
Sarah! Sarah, where are you?!
I knew I couldn't call you guys till my buzz wore off.
well, that cost us a lot of time.
and maybe Sarah's life. Don't you think I know that?
we need your help, Tina, right now.
how?
what is that?
cursory view. Sand.
do you think we were at the beach?
no. Beach sand is white.
it's crushed coral. This is darker.
this is from a sand trap...
maybe.
closest golf course is miles away.
but there's a kids' playground in the area.
this is like the best trip ever.
bahamas, baby!
Yeah! You got something?
that's a...
her hair and her clothing is damp.
the grass around her is dry.
the body is fresh.
take a look at the buttons on her blouse.
could be a redress.
give me a minute, will you?
Yeah.
I'm so sorry.
alexx, please tell me you haven't started the post on Sarah Jennings.
Oh, she just arrived, honey.
not even I work that fast.
Oh, good, then I'm not too late.
too late for what?
to tag our girl for special processing.
special processing?
you don't want me to open her up?
not yet.
Eric said that Sarah's body was wet.
she was. That doesn't make very sense.
we found her on dry land, and it hasn't rained in 24 hours.
so you want to preserve any possible evidence until you process her.
exactly. It might be the only way we find out what happened to her.
well, if it helps, at first blush, she's got petechiae.
bruising around the throat, and her tongue is blue.
so, she was strangled.
with sustained pressure.
did you notice her blouse?
one of the buttons is off.
we're thinking redress.
I'll run a sexual assault kit.
buttons are flat.
they've got a good workable print surface.
I'm going to run them to Joseph.
Hey, Alexx, what is it?
I'm not sure.
UV's picking up something.
actually, it's a lot of something.
take a look.
DUQUESNE: Whatever it is, it's all over her clothes and her body.
I'm almost afraid to find out what it is.
I'm going to take her clothes to Trace.
I'll finish the sexual assault kit.
baby girl's trying to tell us something.
so, Dan, did you get anything from that camera in Sarah's rental car?
I think so. Check it out.
the image went to the laptop, then out over a wireless phone line.
Thanks. But even I knew that.
here's something you didn't know.
the image was sent to a central server in Georgia.
Georgia?
our vic's from Georgia.
that can't be a coincidence.
her whole class is.
anyone with Internet access and a password could access that video feed.
so how do we find our voyeur?
I tracked the I. P. address.
I wonder how many students brought their laptops down.
and it is registered to the Stonemoor Hotel here in Miami.
room 503, to be exact.
you sure it's room 503?
Yeah. Why?
that's Sarah's parents' room.
have you found the person who did this to my daughter?
the search is ongoing.
then why are we here?
why is my husband being questioned?
okay, we traced a hidden camera from your daughter's rental car back to your hotel room.
Sarah was being monitored.
monitored? What do you mean?
it was not by us. We just flew in this morning.
did you fly together?
well, no. Paul came in from Houston.
he was there on business.
how would you describe your husband's relationship with Sarah?
I... Well, he's wonderful.
Sarah was just a baby when we married, but he always treated her like his own.
did you ever suspect anything else going on between them?
what are you insinuating?
you think my husband was involved in this?
that's impossible.
actually, he lied to you, Mrs. Jennings.
your husband has been at the Stonemoor Hotel for several days now.
you don't know what you're talking about.
you installed a surveillance camera in your daughter's rental car so you could spy on her.
you say spy.
I say protect.
from a distance.
she never knew I was watching.
that is not true either.
what's that?
that is a palm print taken from the window of that rental car.
is it going to match to you.
you were stalking her, weren't you?
Sarah: Oh, no.
I was looking out for my daughter.
stepdaughter, you mean?
her mother always thought I was being overprotective, but, uh, she doesn't get it.
she doesn't know how guys can be.
when I saw Sarah get in the backseat with that little... creep,
I sped over to the parking lot.
come on, honey. What are you doing?
what are you trying to do?
Oh, my God! You're out of control.
I'm 18 now. Get over it!
you are flying home with me tonight.
you can't tell me what to do!
you're not even my real father!
I've raised that girl since she was two years old.
I would never hurt Sarah.
then you, uh...
you won't mind giving me a DNA sample, right?
Hey.
the sexual assault kit from Sarah Jennings?
Sarah definitely had intercourse.
but I was only able to get one sperm head from the vaginal sample.
one? How is that possible? Aren't there usually millions?
Pre-ejeculate, faulty condom, or he could have cleaned her up.
can you test just one?
it's tricky. I'm supposed to save half for the defense.
in case their lab wants to independently confirm our lab's results.
and that's the problem.
the sample's so small, it'll be consumed in analysis.
there won't be another half.
if we get a result, there'll be dual discovery.
it's still a gamble. And to be honest?
my job's not exactly on solid ground right now.
blame me.
I'll authorize it.
without the DNA, there won't be a defendant.
okay.
DUQUESNE: What do you know?
not a match to any of our male suspects.
who is that guy?
do you know him?
no. I got a list of clubgoers from the viral marketing girl.
homicide was about to bring him in for questioning.
if this is about the statutory rape charge a year ago, that was dismissed.
this one won't be dismissed.
you murdered Sarah Jennings, didn't you?
murder?
Yes, I can prove that you had sex with her.
Yeah, I did.
we hooked up and had sex on a friend's boat.
consensual sex.
you know how it is; tourist girls.
they come to Miami and anything goes.
we were having a good time until my friend showed up.
friend" as in Jeff Marshall.
what are you doing?! I saw her first!
she was mine!
I've never seen Jeff so pissed.
he's got a temper, so I just left.
how admirable. You just left her there.
thought she was safe.
he was mad at me, not her.
I guess I thought wrong.
thomas said what?
that you did it.
you killed Sarah Jennings.
that's a total lie!
were you jealous that she picked Thomas over you?
maybe you strangled her out of rage.
he's the one that picked her.
he chose her outside the club.
God, look at you! You're out of control!
check out this sweet little thing.
one of the milk states? Michigan, Wisconsin?
stop it! Stop it!
you can't tell me what to do!
you're not even my real father!
she's got daddy issues.
talk about an easy target.
we partied with Sarah and her friend in Liquid Neon until 4: 00, then took it to my boat.
before we could get anywhere, Sarah did an Exorcist.
Whoa! Oh!
nasty. Okay, that's it.
Hey, dial it back, man.
it's the price you pay for tapping tourists.
no, party's over.
maybe for you.
that one's too sweet to throw back.
thomas went after them.
he was with them last.
I never touched her.
Really?
how do you explain that we lifted your fingerprint off the button of her blouse?
it matches your ten card.
don't say another word, Jeff.
he doesn't have to.
a jury will hear how he redressed Sarah to cover his tracks.
no, they won't. It won't make it to jury. Judge will kick at prelim.
not if I can help it.
DUQUESNE: We're at a standstill.
Jeff Marshall lays it all on Thomas.
Horatio: Thomas lays it off on Jeff.
he said-he said.
well, one of them did it.
I'm going to go back to the crime scene.
if there's an answer waiting, it'll be there.
okay, thank you.
Horatio, you and I need to have a conversation.
now is not a good time, Rick.
Jennifer Wilson-- does the name ring a bell?
that's none of your business.
well, see, you made it my business when you sent a patrol officer to sit on her house.
you got no right authorizing overtime for a case that originated out of our jurisdiction.
Wilson is a citizen in Miami and may be in grave danger.
Yes, I know. I've familiarized myself with the case.
then you know the story of a nine-year-old girl who lost her parents to a killer, don't you?
ten years ago. New York, right?
you're still trying to protect her.
that's the job.
never caught the killer, right?
my heart goes out to her, but the taxpayers aren't responsible for covering the cost of Horatio Caine's hunches.
put it on my tab, okay?
sounds like you been paying that tab for a long time.
there's no evidence of the killer.
we sure this is where the murder took place?
no drag marks, lividity's consistent.
we'll just have to trust the Locard's Principle.
I know. Something taken, something left behind.
the answer's are here.
we just don't see 'em yet.
Yeah.
now we do.
Horatio: Gentlemen, I thought it was time we had a little chat together.
Where's your lawyer, Jeff?
I fired him for not letting me talk.
well, now you're going to get your chance.
the Medical Examiner has confirmed that Sarah was strangled between 5: 00 a. m. and 7: 00 a. m. this morning.
after which you redressed her, Jeff.
I walked up on this girl in the park...
dead.
her body showing.
what was I supposed to do, just leave her like that?
dude, they got your prints. Cop a plea.
I didn't kill her.
no, you didn't. Thomas did.
didn't you, Thomas?
what? Me?
I wasn't anywhere near that park this morning.
Oh, yes, you were.
Thomas, you were there.
the sprinkler system in that park goes off automatically at 4: 00 p. m. and at 6: 00 a. m. every day.
so?
the water in the park is reclaimed.
and there is only one source that feeds the park.
it's from the Miami Shores Reservoir.
DUQUESNE: The mixture's as unique as a fingerprint.
the water's infused with a chemical dye-- Rhodamine "B.
you had that exact mixture on your shirt so you were there, Thomas.
okay, I had sex at the park.
that's how the water got on my back.
doesn't mean I killed her.
DUQUESNE: We actually have a way to verify that.
show me your hands, please.
dye in the water reacts to ultraviolet light.
Sarah had digit imprints on her neck.
water places you at the scene.
evidence puts your hands on her throat.
you're crazy.
you're guilty.
get off of me! Shut up.
I said shut up.
I said shut up!
tourist girls...
officer, get him out of my sight.
lieutenant, everything okay?
I'm going to take it from here, all right?
good night.
watch the road - lisa, shut it - Yeah.
if our folks knew we skipped the retreat. we are so toast.
not if we change and get our stories straight.
would you grab the wheel? - Yeah.
what? - Well, that certainly screams church retreat.
actually, Mommy, somebody did have beer.
I had a sip. It was disgusting.
and we'll never ever drink again.
have you found Lisa?
we're still looking.
she just went flying.
she's dead, isn't she?
we don't know that yet.
tell me what happened.
it was my fault.
it was totally my fault. I was changing in the car and, and there was just this bang, and we went off the road.
lieutenant Caine? - Yeah.
we've got something you need to see. - Okay.
I'll be right back, okay?
you two are lucky to be alive.
wish I could say the same about your other friend.
Oh, my God! I don't know her.
there're only two of us.
I was hoping my services wouldn't be needed today.
well, whoever she is,
I can tell by the skin sloughing that she's been underwater at least a day.
she drown?
appears she was stabbed.
a big knife, judging from the wounds.
a murder like this is personal.
no I. D.
we'll drag the river. See what we find.
alexx, would you please roll up her sleeve?
excuse me? - Just please do it.
a birthmark?
her name is Rachel Turner.
Horatio, you know this woman?
I was with her two nights ago.
and if she's been underwater for a full day...
you were the last one to see her alive?
that's correct. And Frank, you'd better move quickly because right now
I'm your only suspect.
《 》
I don't know, Horatio, this doesn't seem right.
I understand, Frank. Let's stay with the procedure--question me.
all right. What was your relationship with the victim?
Rachel is an attorney, Frank, that I met recently at a pretrial hearing.
any bad blood between you two? - No.
you sure? - I'm sure.
you ever been to her place? - Two nights ago she made me dinner.
anyone you know that Nwould want to hurt her? - No.
okay, uh...
were you last night? - I was with you.
all right, I can't think of anything else.
it rained last night. We're not gonna find the killer's tracks.
take these.
you're gonna need them.
I'm not the guy that takes care of that sort of thing.
as of right now, I'm a private citizen.
you sure?
I am. Can I go?
of course you can go.
you sure you want to see this, Horatio?
I have to.
cared about her, didn't you?
Cheers.
she was a great lady.
cause of death is exsanguination.
first wound is defensive, but the rest all penetrated the torso.
she lost a lot of blood, Horatio.
means she was alive long enough to know she was dying.
...Take care of her, okay?
so Horatio really cared about this woman.
would be the first one since Yelina.
well, there's no sign of a forced entry.
the security alarm is deactivated, but there are definitely indications of a struggle.
table's in disarray, wine's been spilled.
I don't see a second wine glass. Let's look for it.
this isn't just red wine.
Rachel Turner's blood?
or it could be the killer's.
a lot of times in a stabbing, the killer will cut themselves in the process.
kind of dark, isn't it?
the AC's off.
it's at least 90 degrees in here.
right. Blood darkens the hotter it is.
Yeah.
you know, this just doesn't make any sense.
if Rachel was killed here, there should be a lot more blood.
well, either the killer...
is an expert at crime-scene clean up, or she was murdered somewhere else.
you rang?
Yeah.
seemed too convenient, the girls went off the road at exactly the spot where Rachel Turner was found.
the accident was no accident.
these punctures are in a pattern. Someone used a spike strip.
who's out to get you, H?
a very old friend, Eric.
I'm gonna grab Ryan, we're gonna go back to the scene.
see where that strip was. - Okay.
Yeah. Well, sure,
Delko, I'll be right down there. I'm just gonna pop into DNA.
okay.
I got your message. Results on the sample from Rachel Turner's apartment?
blood's not hers.
however, we do know the person it belongs to.
damn.
it's Horatio's blood. Maybe he cut himself opening the wine.
maybe, but there is a lot of blood there for a little cut.
Hi, Calleigh. Yeah, I got bad news about the blood sample.
I'll tell Tripp.
Hello, Horatio.
sorry I was late.
what've you got?
they, uh...
they found your blood in Rachel Turner's apartment, Horatio.
and right now I can't explain it.
no idea?
no.
what about Yelina? She disappeared.
Frank, wh... wh-what are you asking me?
I just, uh...
I just want to know where she is.
Frank, she is...
she's safe from harm.
I want to believe you, Horatio.
all right.
if it helps, uh, you can check with the police union. She just filed papers.
Yelina retired? - Yeah.
where did she go?
she's with her family and she's happy.
look, Horatio... - Frank...
it's okay.
spike strip was gone when emergency showed up, which means someone came back to get it.
uh, you know, this may not be the best time for this, but, uh...
you know that check you wrote me?
Yeah, for the children's shelter, sure.
you know I was going to deposit it in my account...
...and I was gonna write one big check from all of us to them?
Yeah.
it bounced.
Horatio's a suspect in a murder investigation and you're hawking me about a check?
my credit's on the line. I got old student loans. I just...
I can't be overdrawn. - Okay, look, last month, I forgot to carry the one.
I'll take care of it, okay? - Okay.
you mind if we get back to the investigation? - I never wasn't in it.
okay, good.
hold on. Hold on.
look, this is where the girl's skid began, which means that the spike strip had to be placed right about here.
there's tire marks on the curb.
Yeah, wider than a Mustang would be.
so somebody pulled up after the accident.
judging from the wheel base, it's a pretty big vehicle.
Hey, I got something.
it's jet black.
it's not from this section of the causeway.
the wheelbase is 122. 6 inches.
what vehicle is that size?
for starters, our department Hummers.
Oh, boy.
how'd it go out there?
things aren't really looking good for the boss.
if Horatio doesn't start putting things into context, he could be in big trouble.
well, that's why we're here.
you working Horatio's blood sample?
Yeah.
let's see what's in it.
that's interesting.
high levels of EDTA.
it's an anticoagulant, isn't it?
it's used when people draw your blood.
or when they store it for a long time.
ten years in Miami, you were never injured.
but you were in New York, weren't you?
ten years ago, in New York City,
I was stabbed badly during my last investigation.
someone's been saving your blood for ten years.
they're trying to frame you.
that is the Wilson family.
somebody left this file in our lab about a week ago.
now, I thought it was Stetler just digging into the past, but now I know that's not the truth.
which is?
have you heard the name Walter Dresden?
he was the guy who locked the children in the closet while he tortured the parents.
I almost captured him in New York City.
he's back.
Why?
ego, Calleigh. I embarrassed him and now he wants revenge.
what do you want to do?
what would we normally do?
follow the evidence, eliminate suspects and catch a killer.
are you in danger?
not if we play it clean.
Hey, Eric.
got those results for you.
on the gravel from the causeway? - Yeah.
I eliminated all immediate environmental concerns
dirt from the road, rubber from the tires.
good. What'd you get?
well, the gravel's pretty standard stuff, but...
take a look at what it's coated with.
a styrene-butadiene anionic polymer.
used to minimize oxidation and create a stronger surface.
for airplanes to land on.
you're looking at tarmac, but I'm guessing that there wasn't a plane near the site of your vehicular accident.
I'm looking for a vehicle that drives out to meet one.
Thanks, Vince. - Sure.
you guys are the only outfit near the airport that rent these kinds of cars, right?
the best way to blend in to Miami is to appear rich, right?
everybody wants a Hummer. We're the only ones who've got 'em.
you rent one in the last couple of days?
Yeah, customer came in, paid cash up front, double the price for his privacy.
who was he? - I don't know.
drove out to the tarmac to get him.
never saw him get in.
vehicle's due back tomorrow. - I need it today.
you equip these things with GPS? - Of course.
Oh, you want me to look it up now? - Just a thought.
hummer's in the Gables.
H. Got a location.
where? - In the Gables.
you want me to send a unit over?
no, no. He won't go back. He's too smart for that.
Where'd he ditch it?
Riviera and Castania. - Where'd you say?
Riviera and Castania. - Eric, um...
I got to go.
Horatio, is he coming after me?
well, sweetheart, there's no way to know, but I want to get you out of here anyway.
I'm not gonna hide for the rest of my life.
and I don't want you to, but I want to get you to a safe place.
so you're putting me back in a closet.
it's for your own good.
that's exactly what he said.
I can still hear my parents screaming.
when I wanted out, I couldn't.
but I opened the door for you, didn't I?
you shielded me from their bodies.
Hi.
is it safe?
it is now.
come on, Jennifer. Come with me.
you can trust me.
Attagirl.
I did trust you.
I want you to trust me now.
how long do I have to disappear?
just until you're safe.
all right?
come on.
there you go.
now, sweetheart, I'll call you later. You're going to be fine. All right?
full process, please.
this is the New York file about the Wilson murder that Horatio gave me.
you want to wait?
Yup.
trace appears to have pretty much degraded.
that doesn't make any sense. It's like it's too clean.
there was one thing that was out of the ordinary, though. We have traces of UW solution.
that's embalming fluid. - Yeah.
what is that, some kind of message?
no, I think it's an oversight. - Where you going?
to talk to a professional.
thank you.
and the scientific name is Berlzer UW.
it's used for organ storage during autopsies.
when was the last time you used it? - I use it all the time.
why is this relevant?
because I'm thinking that someone in here may have touched this file.
I've never seen this before.
maybe there was a mistake.
now, baby, I don't make mistakes.
I know that you don't. I'm just thinking that you might know who could have.
either of you guys seen this case file before?
that's the one I left for Ms. Boa Vista.
when did you do that? - Last week.
some detective stopped me, asked me to drop it off for him.
do you remember which detective?
never seen him before.
I'm pretty sure his I. D. said Phillips.
Matt Phillips. - Thanks.
Hey, Tripp, I need you to have a conversation with one of your guys, okay?
detective Phillips?
Hey, Frank, how you doing? - I'm all right.
you mind if I take a look at your badge and I. D?
now is not the time to lie to me.
see, my D. B. car got broken into, and whoever it was has my badge and my I. D.
at your mistress's place?
and you didn't report it? - Come on, Frank, you know how it is here. I didn't want it to be on my sheet.
well, by not reporting it, you may have helped a killer.
I messed up, okay? But, look,
I'm working on wife number two here, we've got kids together.
I'm not interested in hurting your home life, all right?
but I'm going to impound your car.
Hey. Check that out.
it's not trilobal.
which means it's not from an automobile.
means this fiber is out of place.
Yeah, all right. Well, let's run it through themicrospectrophotometer and break it down completely.
every color leaves a fingerprint.
even if our killer didn't.
find anything yet?
Yeah, this is interesting-- our red fiber isn't even red.
it's actually a combination of three different colors.
its dominate feature is red, but it's accented by blue and cyan.
what about compound?
it is a synthetic blend of nylon, polyester, and dichloromethane.
okay, let's run it through our manufacturer's database.
I want to find out where this carpet came from.
I was looking for you.
the fiber from Detective Phillip's car was manufactured by Hamstead Textiles.
it's a small company out of Buffalo.
it went out of business a couple of months ago, but before it did, it sold 100, 000 yards of "Midnight Rose #11
to Spirex Builders, a company based in Tampa.
Yes, but they do have a condo project right here, as we speak, don't they?
six blocks away.
six blocks away. Thank you.
is that you, Walter? - Horatio Caine.
what was it that led you to me?
fiber? Prints?
or was it that famous Caine instinct?
something like that, Walter.
you okay, Walter? That looked like it hurt.
I should kill you right now.
that wouldn't be good for you, would it?
no, Horatio, it wouldn't.
what happens now?
you...
are going to wait for the cops.
Miami-Dade Police Department! Stay right where you are!
right there!
it's me, Frank.
that's Rachel's blood.
tell me again what happened here.
I came here to confront Rachel's killer.
you know, I don't think so.
how about you never thought we'd find Rachel's body.
you came here to clean up the scene.
but you say Dresden was here, and he just...
flew out the window.
that's exactly what happened, Rick.
H.what's going on?
look around, process my crime scene.
what do you want me to do, H?
you heard the man, Eric, process the scene.
well, there's no carpet, which means there's no fibers...
so Dresden's planted evidence. - That's enough.
you, Lieutenant? You're under arrest.
after you.
not used to dealing with someone this smart.
well, he did lead us to the crime scene, didn't he?
so let's find out what he left for us this time.
okay.
Dresden escaped before the cops got here, so that means...
he must have gone out through one of these window.
unbelievable.
Dresden lowered himself down through one of the trash chutes, and then he pulled it off the building.
found the murder weapon.
it's got a bloody print on it.
think our killer was that stupid?
no.
I think he was that smart.
blood sets prints.
I can't believe Stetler put you in a holding cell.
it's what he does, Calleigh.
Dresden seems to be one step ahead of us at every turn.
and you know that if the news gets a hold of this, it'll look like there's blood on your hands, and we know that's not true.
but there is blood on my hands.
that's why you asked me to bring the kit.
now...
now we make our move.
okay, this is the section that was attached to the windowsill. Now, what are we looking for?
Dresden had to press his hands and feet to the side to keep from falling.
haste makes trace. - That's right.
Hey.
what do you have?
electronic device. It's a piece of a processor, maybe.
so?
those get put in buildings.
Intercoms, entertainment systems, wireless Internet, security systems.
yeah...
but not at this stage of construction.
Oh, so Dresden must have had it on him.
question is, is this part of his crime...
or is it part of his daily life?
what's up, Johnny.
27 grams, right?
Yeah, that should do it.
that's one gram below a felony.
did I ask for your opinion?
Yeah, it's Delko.
you can't read my writing?
I just need you to take the fingerprint, okay, and look for any trace you can find on its surface--other than blood.
that's right.
Thanks.
how much?
that'll be three bills, Big Time.
here you go. That should do it.
did you get the result from the blood on Horatio's hands?
Valera's still processing it.
when she's finished, I'd like you to run it.
you know, technically, it isn't an unsolved.
I know that, but a guy like Dresden doesn't stay idle for ten years waiting for revenge.
you think he's been active?
not necessarily in Miami, but will you check the NCIC, see if there's similar MOs in other counties?
as a favor.
if the Feds find out that I'm working on a current case...
my lips are sealed.
thank you.
where you been? - Had something to do.
I thought you wanted to help Horatio.
who said I didn't?
you know, we could have run the bloody print on that knife by now.
Yeah, which would have been a tremendous mistake, okay?
I already had Trace run some of the surface of the print for me.
glycerin.
that's not something the body secretes. - No, but it does help optimize the workability of a forged print.
the wine glass--Dresden took the one with Horatio's print on it.
to you.
Dresden lifted it after he resolved it with cyanoacrylate.
helps to raise the print off its original surface.
then he transfers the print to a piece of foil.
okay, but how'd it end up on the knife?
print was applied to the knife over a piece of the foil...
...that was dipped into Rachel Turner's blood.
this Dresden guy is good. He's sick, but he's good.
he's not that good.
it's time to let Stetler know to release Horatio from the holding cell.
might have a break. The print from the knife is a forgery.
and the blood that Calleigh swabbed from your hands, results came back. It's not yours or Rachel's.
it's definitely male, though. And once we get...
...a warrant for Dresden's blood, we can run it against his.
good work, Eric.
in the meantime, this proves that your story holds up.
it was a third party in that penthouse.
wanted to make sure you got this back.
thank you, Eric.
let's go.
Dresden's still out there.
look at me, you're dead.
Walter Dresden, right?
Horatio told you about me.
I know everything.
don't lie to me.
he show you the file?
I've seen crime scene photographs of your last murder.
well, not exactly my last.
what else was in there?
what should I have seen?
I don't know
the truth, maybe.
ask Caine about Jennifer Wilson's mother.
don't move!
he said,"Ask Caine about Jennifer Wilson's mother.
I need you to tell me the truth, Horatio.
my partner and I were investigating his murders.
he preyed on happily married couples, but there was one couple who was not so happy.
was that Jennifer Wilson's mother?
my partner was having an affair with her.
and she ended up dead.
that's why you still take care of Jennifer Wilson.
that is a big part of it.
and you were never able to catch him?
miss Boa Vista.
what do we have?
Calleigh had me cross-check the DNA from the Dresden sample against similar crimes across Florida.
I found this-- Orlando, double homicide, young couple, and the DNA is a match to our unknown sample.
was the child locked in a closet? - Seven-year-old boy.
consistent with Dresden's MO.
I don't see any breaking and entering here, do I? Just like Rachel's apartment.
this console.
Apias Systems-- maybe he hard wires smart homes, that's his cover.
that would explain the circuitry that Ryan found.
I thought you were gone.
Mr. Wolfe, Apias Systems, find out who's in the field please. Thank you.
okay, Mr. Wolfe, here's the plan
I will take the two-three corner, you flank me.
go.
we meet again, Walter.
cuff him. - Gladly.
move and I'll blow your brains out.
I always thought we brought out the best in each other, Horatio.
till you killed the Wilsons.
not me.
but smart killer, whoever it was.
got you out of New York.
what the hell is he talking about?
why don't you tell him, Walter?
that Wilson killing was somebody in their own backyard.
Horatio's partner's mistress.
his partner wasn't about to explain it to his wife, and Horatio wasn't about to rat him out.
is that true, Horatio? - Every word, Frank.
every word.
the only way to avoid giving a statement was to quit.
the only noble thing you could do.
can I go now?
actually, Walter, you're not going anywhere.
I have you for murder.
you have nothing that ties me to Rachel Turner.
I don't need it.
the day I visited you at the condo and opened your cheek,
I left there with a blood sample from you.
as it turns out, that sample is a perfect match to the killing in Orlando.
so Walter,
I have you.
and you know what else?
you should have never left New York.
officer.
gentlemen.
are you threatening me?
Oh, your solid record's about to drop markedly.
I won't forget you, Lieutenant.
I've reviewed your evidence against Walter Dresden, and, quiet frankly, I'm concerned.
lieutenant Caine, you should have recused yourself.
I have done so completely, Your Honor.
the facts are that Dresden killed a woman that was close to Lieutenant Caine.
took her out of her apartment...
...and lured the lieutenant to the place where Dresden killed her.
your team should not have been working a case where you were a suspect.
I was not a suspect in the Orlando case, Your Honor.
Oh, you mean where they found the blood.
well, Mr. Dresden says that he cut himself while installing a smart home system.
it's hardly a smoking gun, Lieutenant.
they have an airtight case on him in Orlando.
good, good.
an Orlando judge can hear that evidence.
but in this case,
Dresden's released.
your Honor... Your Honor.
I'd be glad to prosecute Mr. Dresden, just as soon as you bring me unbiased evidence.
but for now, Dresden's a free man.
the blood of his future victims is on you.
I warned you, Lieutenant, didn't I?
good day, gentlemen.
TRIPP: His name's Jay Fisher.
known jeweler, suspected drug lord.
he own the house, Frank?
Yeah. Neighbors called, said they heard multiple gunshots.
judging by the bullet holes in his chest, I suggest there were three gunshots.
does he live here alone?
Yeah. Nobody else was here.
do not move.
hold it right there.
what's your name, jackass.
Caine: What were you doing on the roof, Johnny?
hiding. From the cops.
from the bullets, man.
Caine: I notice that blood on you.
I just got this, just now, when I fell on Fish.
right after you shot him?
I didn't shoot nobody, man.
take him away, please.
okay, so I guess you don't want to hear about what I got on one of your cops.
the dope.
hang on a second.
Oh, no, man, you said to go-- I don't want to obstruct... What are you talking about, Johnny?
Cubano guy... Delko.
he buys drugs, man.
I sell it to him.
that's a bunch of crap, you're lying.
if I'm lying, how come I got his phone number?
check it, Frank.
under "D.
you got this from the website.
it's his personal number, dawg.
let me see that, Frank.
call it.
: Hey, what's up, this is Eric, leave a message.
get him out of here.
what are you gonna do?
I am going to get to the truth.
I was just there buying dope, man.
I wouldn't shoot Fish.
so the GSR test from you hands should come back negative then.
hell yeah, it should.
I was upstairs, on the head, when the whole thing went down, man.
there was all this screaming, and hell'a shooting.
fisher: No, you need to get my permission, bitch.
man: I'm not your bitch.
what you need to do is stay the hell out my territory.
come on, man, put that away.
we're just talking. Well, we're not no more.
only part I believe is the part about the guns.
there was somebody else there, man.
well, you're good at dropping names-- who was it?
I didn't see him.
what a shock.
Hey.
his name is Johnny Nixon, Eric.
you two know each other, don't you?
what did he tell you?
he told me that he sold you marijuana.
that true?
Yeah, it is.
there were extenuating circumstances, H.
Eric, listen to me, I don't want you to say anything to anybody, especially Internal Affairs, circumstances or not, okay?
so you definitely think there will be an investigation?
gentlemen.
as expected, Rick.
just doing my job, Horatio.
and loving every minute.
Rick, Eric has requested to speak to a union rep before he talks to you.
great.
first order of business, need a urine test from you.
that's fine.
okay, second,
I need to speak with all his colleagues and get a statement.
and that will include you.
that's not going to be a problem, Rick.
okay, where's the witness?
the suspect is right in that room, currently being interrogated for murder, Rick.
if you'll excuse me, gentlemen.
look, H. I'm telling you the truth.
I don't smoke pot.
so somebody really did fall through the skylight.
used my boy here as a landing pad.
be careful of the glass, honey.
already tore up my pants.
Hey, Alexx, how many wounds did you say he had?
three big, nasty ones.
I've got four casings.
all 9-mil.
maybe our shooter missed.
might have been what weakened the skylight.
still won't give us our shooter's location.
neither will the casings.
they were scattered when he fell through the skylight.
Yeah, you know, he did a really good job of contaminating the crime scene.
that's not all he did.
guy's a drug dealer.
said Eric is one of his clients.
Really?
I don't believe that, do you?
Eric Delko, using drugs?
no way.
can I... Yeah, yeah, sure, I cleared the area.
what are you doing here?
I just live up the street, and I heard all the sirens.
what's going on? You live up the street?
in this area?
it's a long story.
it can't be a bad one if it ended up in this neighborhood.
um, I'm kind of locked in the lab my whole life, and I'm just wondering, could I observe?
I mean, I won't touch anything, I promise.
Yeah, sure, I guess so.
um, you know what, put these on, just in case.
where are you going to start?
patrol said somebody hit the intercom.
you think the killer did it?
maybe.
so... this your first time to a crime scene?
second... first by choice.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, I'm sorry.
okay, just don't move, I'm coming, all right?
you know what?
you may have uncovered a key piece of evidence.
next time, look with your eyes, not with your feet, okay?
: Absolutely.
it's tempered.
wolfe: Yeah, it's safety glass.
if we're lucky, it came from the getaway car's window.
why is that lucky?
because it will tell us exactly what make and model it's from.
those are numbers.
wolfe: They're called bugs.
they look like numbers.
they're Department of Transportation numbers.
Oh, security etching.
they tell you the make and model of the car.
Yeah, they tell you the make, the model, where it was made, what month and year.
they even tell you the VIN number.
here, read them to me, and I'll run them.
that's all I got.
I'll give it a shot.
you got the R. O?
should pop up with the VIN number.
here we come.
get off me, you bitch-ass punk!
I know law! This is a case of excessive force, I ever seen it.
help Miss Walters up. Bitch-ass!
Dee-Nasty.
and I don't need no po-po telling me what to do.
well, Miss Nasty, you commit murder,
I'll tell you whatever I want to tell you.
what?
man, I wasn't anywhere near no murder.
why don't you try again.
we found glass from your car at the scene.
Yeah, screwed up my ride, so what?
so you shot Jay Fisher, and took off in that ride.
man, you leanin'.
I ain't shot nobody.
you want to tell me about that cut on your lip?
got it off my grill.
your grill?
what about the scratches?
whatever, man, I ain't got nothing to hide.
fish sold me this grill, then decided he wanted it back.
man, I already gave you five G's.
do I look like I do layaway?
you're gonna give me my full ten.
come on, Fish, quit trippin'.
how about I... rush it to you in a couple of weeks?
you're gonna rush it to me in a couple... Yeah, baby, what.
is that what you're gonna do for me, baby?
I don't think so.
no guns involved?
straight-up truth, man.
I left, he was alive.
pissed, but alive.
then you won't mind me checking your car, will you?
under the seat?
that's not too sly, sweetheart.
we had 9-mil casings at the scene.
you want to explain that?
look, T. J. Hooker, it's a coincidence.
no such thing.
did you hear anything about Delko? Not yet.
is IAB investigating?
I believe they are.
ms. Duquesne, Mr. Wolfe.
sure you've heard about the investigation into Eric Delko.
protocol dictates I interview his colleagues.
dude, are those rolling papers in there?
they're not mine.
what if we refuse?
you're either a witness or a suspect.
it's kind of brutal, isn't it?
I mean, we're all cops here.
that is why it should be brutal.
as moral governors of the community, we should be held to a higher standard.
who wants to go first?
you know what to do with that.
STETLER: Have you ever seen Eric Delko smoke marijuana or use any other kind of drug?
no.
have you ever seen him purchase marijuana or any other kind of drug?
no.
have you ever seen Eric Delko with any drug paraphernalia of any kind?
no.
STETLER: Have you ever seen Eric Delko smoke marijuana or do drugs of any kind?
no. Have you ever seen him purchase marijuana or any other drugs?
no.
have you ever seen him with any drug paraphernalia?
I've, um...
I've never seen him with anything illegal.
not everything's illegal.
a pipe-- that's legal.
certain syringes-- they're not.
What'd you see him with?
need I remind you we are under oath here?
I know.
then what did you see him with?
rolling papers.
now, what did you think they were for?
tobacco.
have you ever known Eric Delko to smoke cigarettes?
no.
then you didn't think they were for tobacco.
Hey, Jim, did you test the 9-mil from the girl's car yet?
Nope, not yet.
why not?
because I'm organizing the firearms locker.
markham, do you know what this case is about?
it's about test firing the confiscated weapon, then comparing the test rounds to the 9-mil bullets collected from your victim.
actually, it's about a homicide.
right.
dope dealer shot dope dealer.
come on, it's a victimless crime.
it's about a man, a citizen of Miami, who was found dead in his home.
and maybe he made some mistakes in his life, but it's not for you to judge.
and that is what this crime is about, and that is why I'm taking back my lab.
what?
I mean, you can't fire a county employee, Calleigh.
no, but I can have you transferred.
no match.
so Miss Dee-Nasty's not our shooter.
and Johnny's hands tested negative for GSR.
so that means somebody else had to be there.
I'm going to do a reconstruction.
are those the crime scene photos?
Yeah. Just picked 'em up.
what's wrong with your photos?
what do you mean?
they're out of focus.
something must be wrong with my camera.
is your eye okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
don't lie to me.
Calleigh, I'm fine.
I think I got to get a new camera, though.
you know what I think?
you should see a doctor.
I assume I got this house call because you don't want an emergency eye exam on your county medical record.
well, you never know what some county doctor will come up with.
it's probably just some pinkeye.
pinkeye, huh?
in the same eye you had a big rusty-ass nail sticking out of two weeks ago?
you have a diagnosis?
Yeah. You've got an infection.
an infection.
that's not a big deal, right?
infection could be a sign of something more serious.
how are you feeling?
you got any headaches?
no.
what about your vision?
cloudiness, sensitivity to light, dark spots?
no, no.
Ryan, you need to see an ophthalmologist.
I know a good one.
if it was something...
...I'd lose my job, wouldn't I?
sweetie... right now, you need to be worried about losing your eyesight.
more antibiotics.
and I need you to take them for the full two weeks.
none of this "I feel better so I'm going to stop" thing.
thank you, Alexx.
I'm not done.
promise you'll make an appointment.
Yes.
Bob here's not getting any lighter.
that's okay.
you can put him down.
which way do I face him?
well, that's what we need to figure out.
Alexx found two 9-mil rounds in the body, but the last one was a through-and-through.
that's the one that will tell us where the shooter stood?
exactly, but first, we need to find out where the victim stood.
so if you turn on the laser in his back...
it's a . 45 caliber.
thought you said all the other bullets and casings were, uh...
9-mil.
I did.
we got two guns.
we got two shooters.
could be anywhere along that line all the way to the window.
DUQUESNE: Someone was standing out here.
and we may have prints.
DUQUESNE: This may be our killer.
nothing in Florida.
I'll go national.
california address.
he's far from home.
Yes, so he's got to stay somewhere.
I'll run his credit cards.
do that, please.
what the hell?
TRIPP: Cameras, maps, guns...
Oh, my.
so, what's this all about?
TRIPP: He's got a . 45 here.
what are you, some sort of a stalker?
he's a bounty hunter, Frank.
isn't that right, friend?
Card-carrying.
what was the price on Fisher?
fisher who?
the man you killed this morning.
what was his price?
easy enough to find out.
I'll run Fisher's warrants.
you got no right to look at those.
TRIPP: Actually, we do.
this is a murder investigation.
I notice that you have plenty of photographs of Mr. Fisher.
if I was trying to catch him for bounty, why would I kill him?
because maybe he didn't want to get caught.
what are you doing?
looking at the surveillance photos from the bounty hunter.
see if I can find anything to nail him.
doesn't his . 45 match the through-and-through bullet?
Yeah, but that wasn't the bullet that killed Fisher.
the two 9-mil rounds did.
so we only have him for attempted homicide.
Yeah.
is that the crime scene?
Yeah, that is.
unless Fisher wears the same thing every day, this was taken this morning.
wait. Look at that.
there's someone behind him in the mirror.
I'm gonna zoom in.
who is that?
that is our second shooter.
I'm a little confused.
you want to tell me why you were at Fisher's house?
cause he's got no warrants.
you want to tell me why you're hitting me for murder when your own people say my bullet didn't kill the guy?
bull... you were after this man, weren't you?
I want to know his name.
you got a job to do, so do I.
what's his name?
I tell you, you just arrest and eradicate, and then I don't get my money.
your bail jumper just became our suspect.
Yeah, my guy's been real bad,
stepping on Fisher's toes, selling dope, stealing clients.
no, you need to get my permission, bitch.
I'm not your bitch.
Yeah, you my bitch.
what you need to do is stay the hell out my territory.
come on, man, put that away.
we're just talking.
Yeah, well, we not no more!
I couldn't just let him shoot my ATM.
your jumper picked up the 9-mil?
I told you, he's the real bad guy.
and now he's our suspect, Bull, so who is he?
your suspect, my paycheck.
now if you don't mind, I'd like to call my attorney, post bail and go catch this character.
turns out that we're after the same man, doesn't it?
may the best man win.
what?
you popped positive for THC.
that's a key ingredient in marijuana.
I'm not saying anything.
you're not working here, either.
you're relieved of duty.
no, no, no, just stop.
put that down.
sir, take care of this, please.
let's go.
I don't need to be led out.
actually, protocol says you do.
where are you taking him, Rick?
he popped positive, Horatio.
I'm sure there's an explanation.
can you explain why one of his colleagues ratted him out?
no, I can't.
he's going to IAB for questioning.
he knows the way.
protocol says...
I don't care about protocol.
he is not a criminal.
I'm not saying he is.
I'm just saying procedure states that he not drive a county vehicle.
then I will drive him.
Eric, I'll meet you downstairs.
what are you doing?
I don't know what you're asking.
this is not about Eric, is it?
this is about you and me.
I don't have time for this, Horatio.
I want an answer.
you want an answer?
okay, I'll give you an answer.
your name wasn't the only one on lieutenant's list for promotion.
I scored better than you.
I interviewed better than you.
and I don't know what favor you pulled for the chief, but the promotion was mine.
now the only thing I can do to make lieutenant is this IAB crap.
and everybody hates IAB.
don't punish my lab over it.
I'm just evening the score.
this is a dangerous game.
it's one I intend to win.
we'll see you.
wolfe: That guy, there.
he's in profile.
we gonna be able to use facial recognition?
uh... let me try something.
okay, first, I need to enhance.
now what?
it gets creepy.
looks like Robocop.
Yeah.
faces aren't symmetrical... unless you're Gisele.
so now I tweak the left side, until hopefully I get a hit on my recognition software.
this could take a while.
okay, so, this is frustrating.
no ID yet?
no.
okay, let's think.
what do we know about this guy?
nothing, except our bounty hunter followed him from California.
and he was standing in the crime scene.
and so was Johnny.
because he fell on it.
take your clothes off.
what? Why?
because we said so.
not in front of her, man.
that's embarrassing.
Delko had to pee in a cup 'cause of you, so strip.
man.
wait a minute.
it's gum.
there's glass in it.
that came from the crime scene.
could belong to our mystery man.
we were talking.
and now we're not.
I'll take it to DNA.
saliva on the gum doesn't match your victim, Johnny or the bounty hunter.
which is actually a good thing.
we need to ID our mystery thug.
it's in CODIS now.
start with California, 'cause that's where he's from.
California?
Really?
Yeah. Why?
cause I saw a car parked just down from my house, this morning, California plates.
did you get a plate number?
no.
but it was a truck-- black, I think.
that could help us find him. Thanks.
got a hit on the gum.
wanted for vehicular manslaughter and DUI.
plowed into a family with his Beemer.
probably downed ten Jack and Cokes at the country club.
he kind of looks like the guy from the mirror, but I don't know.
something's off.
Yeah, it is.
guy's got four aliases.
I wonder if he's got as many faces.
Hey, Tripp, you got a minute?
Yeah. Did you get an ID?
Yeah, check it out.
this guy's gonna be hard to find.
his face was rearranged.
Yeah.
I'm thinking now would be a good time to do more, too.
guy's running from his second murder charge.
Miami's plastic surgery central.
it's bad plastic surgery central.
more unlicensed doctors here than any other part of the country.
I know one that works for cash.
I thought you looked a little tight around the eyes.
I busted him a while back.
he was working on felons.
it's worth a shot.
you got an address?
Yep.
I'm gonna grab Horatio.
this could be a long shot, Horatio.
maybe not, Frank.
maybe not. Make a call.
requests two unit back up.
1275 Bayview Lane, Keystone Island.
here we go.
get back here!
damn it!
doctor?
doctor, put it down.
Miami-Dade Police.
put it down slowly.
the guy took my boat!
put your hands behind your back.
I have two suspects heading southbound on Keystone Island, in the water, main canal...
I said keep your hands behind your back.
stay where you are.
I know you.
they're in a MAS-28.
he took my boat.
tell me what happened.
the guy came in, had a gun.
took my patient right off the table.
then he stole my boat.
: found your damn boat.
dumped near Indian Creek Village.
what about the suspect? No sign.
just some blood in the boat.
Yeah, I just started the surgery.
he's probably still bleeding.
could be on their way to California by now.
not if he's smart, Frank.
welcome home, boy.
I need a medic down here.
bail Enforcement Agent.
got an outstanding warrant from California.
need to book this guy.
I think I can help with that.
all right.
all right. He's all yours, right after I get his booking receipt.
Mr. Merrick, I'm losing my patience with you.
you should be thanking me.
you got Fisher's killer.
what are you talking about?
I didn't kill Fisher. You did.
Yeah, nice try.
I don't know what this jackass has told you, but I saw him shoot Fisher.
I'm listening.
I'm arguing with Fish, he hits me.
I'm on the ground, then bang-- Fisher gets shot.
DILLER: I see him in the window with a gun.
so I take off.
I heard two shots. He killed him.
that's it.
it's his word against mine.
now, who are you gonna believe, a felon, or someone who catches them?
I will believe the evidence.
well, good luck with that.
cause last I checked, you didn't have any.
but I will, Mr. Merrick, I will.
you remember where it was parked?
Yeah, it was right about here behind this tree because I remember I could only see the back part of it from my kitchen window.
so right about here.
Yeah. Yup.
so, why do you think he'd toss it here?
I mean, it was really sort of stupid.
it was broad daylight.
you know, the dumbest thing a criminal can do is hang on to a murder weapon.
he was a bounty hunter, so he was a pro.
so, if he shot someone, he'd know to toss the gun.
Yeah, exactly.
this would have been the first chance he got.
I found it.
now, let's hope we can find some prints.
found the gun where you tossed it.
your prints were all over it.
it was self-defense.
it was greed.
you shot Fisher to protect your paycheck.
no one was shooting at you because no one ever saw you.
not until you shot Fisher.
who the hell are you?
come on, dawg, let's work this out.
we got a bunch of lasers to prove that.
and we got you for murder.
this time, you're not gonna get bail, either.
well, live by the sword, die by it.
somebody tipped you to the drug feud.
I want to know who it is.
didn't just tip me.
he gave me directions.
he led you to Diller and Fisher?
who are we talking about?
the kid-- Johnny Nixon.
that makes Johnny an accomplice.
that'll add some time to his sentence.
it may do more than that.
hang on to Bull here, please.
you're Lieutenant Caine.
you're Eric's sister.
how did you know that...?
the blonde that worked with Eric.
she saw us at the hospital.
and you put it together.
my brother doesn't do drugs, Lieutenant.
you know what?
let's, um...
let's have a seat.
Thanks.
I didn't think so.
he's just around when I do.
about eight months ago, I found a lump, and, uh, I started chemo a little bit after that.
I'm sorry to hear that.
so, you...
so, you smoke for the pain?
the nausea mostly.
can hardly keep anything down.
Eric sits with me while I medicate, and, um... then he helps me eat.
and without Eric...
I don't know. I can't, uh... I can't work anymore.
he pays my rent, my bills.
and I know that he's been late.
the poor guy's been driving me around everywhere.
deserved an award for taking care of me.
I'm not exactly, you know, low maintenance.
instead, he is getting fired.
um, that's not gonna happen.
well, not if I tell whoever I need to what's going on.
no, it's not what I mean.
what I mean is, I'm not gonna let that happen.
this is my fault.
I cannot let him lose his job.
Marisol, it would be a whole lot worse to lose you.
STETLER: Horatio, this is Monica West from the State's Attorney's office.
sergeant Stetler, on what grounds did you test Eric Delko?
grounds?
reasonable suspicion.
based on?
based on the identification of said employee as a suspect in a criminal investigation involving illegal drugs.
through reliable and credible sources.
that's how the policy goes, right?
who was your source, Sergeant Stetler?
uh, Mr. uh, Johnny Nixon.
let me get this clear.
your source is a known drug trafficker and accomplice to murder?
is that right?
what about the urine test?
Delko tested positive.
his exposure was passive.
do you have any evidence that the THC came from active use?
well, there is really no way to tell if...
no.
sergeant Stetler, if that's all you have, then I'm afraid my office could never take the word of a doper over that of a cop.
miss West, there are other considerations...
we're done here.
I would agree.
I want to apologize for not coming to you sooner.
Eric, you were taking care of your family.
Yeah, if anyone can understand that, it's you.
I understand the damage this could have caused all of us.
you have my word, it won't happen again.
good, because it can't.
you understand?
I know.
all right.
she's lucky to have you.
it's the other way around.
was released from Westgate State Prison, convicted in the rape of Valerie Naff.
I just appened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I'm still in a dream.
you know, I haven't woken up yet.
new DNA testing revealed he was not a match after new DNA testing at state prison.
right now I'm just really happy.
Lexington stood outside the Biscayne courthouse toy a free man.
...a free man.
.a free man.
how does it feel to be released from prison?
what are you going to do first?
are you angry about the wasted six years you spent behind bars?
I don't want to dwel on the negative.
I'm just glad to be out.
...just glad to be out.
...just glad to be out.
will the State Attorney's ce apologize to Mr. Lexington?
we wish him the best.
as our technological capabilities advance, so does the strength of our justice system.
this day would not have been possible without Miami-Dade's Justice Project and DNA analyst
today, Brian Lexington has been exonerated.
thanks to the newest advance in DNA research,
I am very proud to say justice has been served.
lieutenant Caine.
lieutenant Caine.
I undetand it's official.
the conviction's been overturned.
Brian Lexington is innocent?
as of ght now, he's a free man.
OK, well, I need to know if he didn't rape me, then who did?
so weird how life works, isn't it?
when you think about it, you guys had that rapist's DNA all along.
we had one foreign pubic hair in Valerie Naff's sexual assault kit.
the rapist used a condom. That is it.
one hair, one root.
we had absolutely no possibility for a profile.
we just didn't have the technology back then.
exactly. And now six years later nuclear DNA is pulled from a single root, duplicated, analyzed
a profile that excluded Brian Lexington.
Yeah. You really stopped the presses on that one.
what's that supposed to mean?
I think that it's one thing to exonerate, it's something else entirely to hold a press conference.
why, do you think that I'm shining a light on this lab's mistakes?
well, there's a difference between a mistake and scientific capabilities, and the problem is the press doesn't always see that difference.
you know, I spend every working hour knee-deep in lab reports and evidence logs and analyzing DNA from hundreds of different cases.
feds like to see results.
so if that means that the future of this grant depends on me making a couple of public appearances,
I'm going to do it.
did you run the DNA sample through CODIS yet?
Yeah.
no hits yet.
we've got no suspects.
okay, well, if you need me,
I'll be in the evidence locker with Ryan.
did you pull the file?
I did.
Brian Lexington convicted of the 1999 rape of Valerie Naff.
these are Valerie's pajamas.
some stuff that was collected from her house:
a remote, tissue box, ripped magazine, couple housekeys.
Valerie's underwear.
so Brian claimed that he stole Valerie's underwear earlier in the day, but he didn't rape her.
that was his story after we found his fingerprints all over her underwear drawer.
Brian was one of her movers, wasn't he? Yeah.
so his prints would have been all over her furniture.
we also found his shoeprint outside her bedroom window and her underwear in his car.
guy sounds like a sexual deviant.
Yeah, and the victim ID'd him.
I would have locked him up.
we did.
unfortunately, it was for the wrong crime.
he didn't rape her.
and the guy who did has been a free man for six years.
so we need to go back and take a harder look at everything.
I'm going to rerun the prints from the crime scene six years ago and see if it matches anything new.
everything old is new again.
Yes, Brian.
here I am, Caine. See?
you came after me and you were wrong.
on the day the lady was raped, we caught you with a pair of her underwear, so you understand my concern about you.
I didn't rape her.
no, apparently not.
what can I do for you today?
a little late for that, don't you think?
half-dozen years.
I'm filing a lawsuit naming you and this department and anyone else I can think of.
that's your right.
malicious prosecution.
not to mention the injuries I received in prison.
and I'm hiring George Hammett to represent me.
you'll be a perfect match.
I want to be sure that I get what I'm entitled to.
I'm certain you will, Brian. And Brian?
for your sake, I hope I never see you in here again.
I want you to see something.
girl slammed into the center divider on the 95 doing 80.
DUI?
police said there were no skid marks at the scene, so she didn't step on the brakes.
weird thing is her trauma's not bad enough to kill her.
could be internal trauma.
let's see what we've got.
she had a tough couple months.
appendectomy scar's still healing.
it looks infected.
kept the incision from healing properly.
Oh, my God.
that's no infection I've ever seen.
it's a surgical sponge from the appy.
the infection built until it sent her into toxic shock.
could have hit when she was driving.
what kind of hacks do they let practice medicine these days?
my question exactly.
you have to see what I found in Valerie's pajamas.
where am I looking?
near the missing button.
you see it?
silver flakes, yeah.
it's a powder. Trace ran it.
graphite powder.
what does that mean?
locksmiths inject graphite powder into keyways to lubricate locking mechanisms.
and Valerie probably had her locks replaced when she moved in.
then why is there graphite powder on Valerie's pajamas?
I've got a pretty good idea.
we questioned everyone who came in and out of that house, including the locksmith, but I think this deserves another round.
look, I told them all this years ago.
I re-keyed the whole place that day, left three keys, was gone by noon.
how do you explain the graphite powder on her pajamas?
I installed a bedroom lock.
she was unpacking. Her clothes were everywhere.
I thought you had the guy.
he wasn't the rapist.
the case has been reopened.
so has your background: 18 months ago, you were arrested for domestic violence.
Yeah, well, my ex is the one with the temper.
listen, lady, you've got the wrong guy.
then you won't mind giving us a DNA sample.
Hey, wait up.
what's up? Nothing. I, uh...
your bracelet, I found it in my couch.
I thought you might want it back.
Thanks.
you're welcome.
I had a great time last night.
: me, too.
all right, I got to get back in the field. Okay.
Oh, well, take this with you.
Why?
it's not mine.
my bad.
so bad.
can I borrow you for a second?
you can have him.
thank you.
what's going on?
: nothing.
what have you got?
Kelly Gerber, 22.
it's a car accident.
that's the TC report.
compare it to mine.
infection killed her?
from a shoddy appendectomy.
she was dead before she hit the guardrail.
okay, then the hospital's the crime scene.
I'll sniff around.
I'd appreciate that.
call me.
will do.
woman: Dr. Forest, please dial 118.
man: Gerber? I'm sorry, I don't.
last week?
Yeah, it was an appendectomy.
that's probably why.
it was sandwiched between two coronary artery bypasses.
one of them had complications.
doctor, the girl died.
Really?
Yeah.
our ME said the cause of death was toxic shock.
well, as sorry as I am, you do realize that no surgery is ever routine.
I do.
I also know that mistakes can be made.
I have to, uh, remove a tumor from a 58-year-old lung cancer patient.
you do realize that these questions aren't going to go away.
I do, and I'm not running from them.
excuse me.
so, where are we at?
well, Calleigh brought me the swab from the locksmith, but it doesn't match the DNA from the pubic hair.
it doesn't?
I really thought we had him.
what's that?
plan "B"?
no, it's more like "W ."
the locksmith told Calleigh he brought three new keys on the day of the crime.
there's only two in here.
someone took a key off the ring?
might be some skin cells.
maybe.
will you swab the keyring for epithelials?
I'm the one who started this whole merry-go-round.
thank you.
I have information on the old rape case, or new rape case.
I'm listening. Ryan had me process a keyring found at Valerie Naff's house six years ago.
it had Valerie's epithelials on it, but it also had male epithelials that match the DNA from the pubic hair.
so our rapist has a key to the front door.
and let himself in.
which means he's still out there
Brian: I've been meaning to talk to you.
VALERIE: I don't know. I just can't talk to you face to face like this.
it's too much. It's too soon.
Brian: No, Valerie. It's too late.
how long do you plan to turn your back on this?
VALERIE: I need time to sort it all out, please.
just respect that and leave me alone, okay?
don't you think an apology is in order?
Caine: Everything all right, guys?
it will be, as soon as he leaves.
you can't run, not this time.
Brian, I believe the lady asked you to leave.
it's a free country, and I am a free man.
you are, but you're standing on private property, so take off.
you okay?
he's naming me in the lawsuit.
wrongful accusations.
he's naming a lot of people, Valerie.
could I come in, please?
come on in.
Valerie, we have reason to believe that the man who raped you did not come in through the bedroom window.
well, then, so how did he get in?
we think he had a key.
now, I know it's been six years, but try to remember, who else had a key to this house?
I remember his breath, his grip.
I don't remember a key.
okay, what about your boyfriend, Doug?
Doug and I didn't get together until after the incident.
so he never had a key.
he doesn't have a key now.
nobody has access to my home but me.
somebody had a key, Valerie.
lieutenant, you're telling me that the person that did this to me could have been living around me for the last six years with a key to my house, and I wouldn't know who it is?
it's possible.
you Alexx Woods?
Dr. Woods.
you must be Dr. Kessler.
Yeah, you want to tell me what's going on?
what are you doing?
trying to pull a bullet out of this guy's kidney.
sending an investigator over to question my competence?
what happens in my OR is none of your business.
a 22-year-old girl ended up in my morgue with a surgical sponge in her gut.
well, it's not my job to count sponges.
Oh... so it's the scrub nurse's fault.
that's funny, 'cause she said you left in the middle of the surgery.
Dr. Woods, this is my fifth year as attending thoracic surgeon.
do you have any idea how many people are out there living happy, healthy lives because of me?
try to sticking to the dead ones.
try not sending them to me.
there's something we're not seeing.
exactly.
Horatio said she kept her keys on a shelf.
Yeah, I see them there.
if he touched that shelf, his prints are gone by now.
what about the picture frame on the shelf next to the keys?
it's a gift.
it's a picture of her house.
housewarming.
another visitor with opportunity.
so someone gave her a gift and stole a key.
what are the odds she still has the gift?
it's been six years.
you're OCD. Have you ever thrown a picture frame away ever?
I'll call her.
Hi, Valerie, it's Ryan Wolfe,
Miami-Dade CSI.
Yeah, we're just going through a case file.
well, we're looking at old photographs of your house from the day you moved in.
let me ask you something.
do you remember if someone gave you a sterling silver picture frame as a gift?
uh, yeah, my real estate agent, Jeff Colson, gave it to me.
okay, great. Thank you so much.
it was the real estate agent.
no, you're wrong, way off.
I've been asked these questions all before.
well, the case has been reopened.
turns out the guy that raped her stole the housekey.
look, I still think it was Brian Lexington, that mover.
I was with Valerie on moving day.
he was practically drooling whenever she walked by.
he probably stole her key.
Yes, but, Jeff, proximity says you did.
VALERIE: Let's have a toast.
I just have to find my champagne glasses.
Caine: And then you came back that night.
all the evidence is pointing right at you, Jeff.
you might want to give me a DNA sample and eliminate yourself as a suspect.
get a warrant.
Hey, Jessica.
can you stick this warrant under his nose?
I need a signature.
the judge is returning to chambers in five minutes.
you got your supporting docs?
uh, yeah.
you gonna sign it?
that the warrant, Frank?
Yeah. Judge Harrison's our go-to, sealed and delivered.
Colson's camped out here today trying to sell this dump.
let's go to the open house.
all right.
Miami-Dade Police, Jeff.
maybe he's out back.
Frank... he's right there.
talk about a rush to judgment.
this is no coincidence, Frank.
so somebody knew he was our primary suspect.
and beat us to him.
guess you won't be needing that search warrant for his DNA.
this'll tell us if he's the rapist.
multiple contusions to his scalp.
he was hit upside the head with something, honey.
vic also took some body blows.
bruised abdomen... and ribs.
there's a considerable amount of injuries here, Horatio.
this attack was overkill.
looking to buy?
not in this lifetime, Alexx.
there was a piece of sculpture here.
what are you thinking?
I'm thinking it was the murder weapon.
tell you this:
it was personal.
fueled by rage.
and nobody has more than a rape victim.
are you sure, Lieutenant Caine?
my real estate agent.
there must be a mistake.
it doesn't appear to be the case, Valerie.
I thought he was one of the good guys.
I recommended him to my friends.
I mean, I spent hours with him looking at houses.
empty houses.
how did I miss it?
you know what I don't want to do?
I don't want to make this your fault.
who killed him?
well, I'm trying to determine that, and so what I'm doing is
I'm talking to all the people who knew Jeff and I need to talk to you.
that's why I'm really here, isn't it?
I'm a suspect.
where were you two hours ago and what were you doing?
I was at home.
you were at home with your boyfriend Doug?
Doug didn't do this.
he's the only one I can count on.
he's been with me through everything.
where would I find Doug... right now?
going somewhere?
my girlfriend deserves a vacation.
thinking about tooling around the Caribbean.
can I help you with something?
Fairline's a safe bet, 39 knots.
it's a large purchase on a landscaper's salary.
I get a lot of work.
is that where you smashed your knuckles-- at work?
Oh, comes with the territory. Yardwork.
hands take a beating.
Jeff Colson took a beating, too.
should I know who that is?
maybe.
he raped your girlfriend six years ago.
wait, are you saying you found him?
the real guy?
we found him dead. Yeah.
really.
does Valerie know? Have you told her?
we have.
she's under investigation as well.
I know she never thought you'd get her attacker.
to be honest, neither did I.
did you get to him first?
what?
look, I have no idea how he wound up dead, but, uh, after what Valerie and I have been through
I think we'll both sleep better knowing he is.
as long as you sleep on dry land.
pardon?
we're gonna want to talk to you again.
boa Vista, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, what's up?
did you talk to anybody about my DNA request?
for the search warrant? Yeah.
no. Who would I talk to? Well, I don't know.
you've been pretty chummy with the press lately.
did you page me?
you know, everybody knows that cops corner the market on gossip, Frank.
don't come interrogating me.
I hand-walked that search warrant directly to Judge Harrison. Now, there's information on this investigation, and it's leaking from somewhere.
you know, it may have nothing to do with you guys.
what do you mean?
there might be a mole in the department.
are you serious?
I got it from a pretty reputable source.
they say it's someone in the lab.
well, that's easy. Who's got a grudge?
they say it's someone we like, someone we, uh, trust.
TRIPP: Well, whoever it is, somebody got to our rape suspect before we did.
not a suspect anymore. Here's the DNA on your dead real estate agent.
I just ran it.
he's the rapist.
so, six years ago, Jeff Colson raped Valerie Naff.
you were after the right guy.
it's one case closed.
one wide open.
what did you get on the glass, Eric?
a whole bunch of minerals in the doctor's OJ.
the AA showed traces of calcium and magnesium, and, uh, the MS-- I'm waiting for the results now.
the MS found vitamin B6 and 5-HTP.
I guess it's nothing.
it's just vitamins to keep him healthy.
or to keep his secret.
what do you mean?
the 5-HTP in combination with the other vitamins
also known as minimizing supplements.
minimizing for what?
the side effects of Ecstasy.
he was sweating bullets in my morgue, and you know how cold we keep that room.
why would a 36-year-old thoracic surgeon take Ecstasy on a regular basis?
he should be past that kind of partying.
maybe it's not about the party.
my sister-- she, um...
she deals with nausea and pain that never lets up.
ever.
I heard. I'm sorry, Eric.
I don't know.
you look for relief anywhere you can get it.
legal or not.
thank you.
one phone call to the Chief of Staff
they'll do a urine test.
one call.
okay, you want me to get into a program?
done.
you're not putting up much of a fight.
you're not giving me a whole lot of options.
I suppose I'm not.
especially when you're worried what an investigation into your Ecstasy use might uncover.
what?
the sweating, the eyelid tremor.
what happens in my OR?
they're early signs of Parkinson's.
it's not recreational.
it's professional.
it keeps the tremors under control.
it stops my hands from shaking.
and your hands were shaking when you were performing Kelly Gerber's appendectomy.
and that's why you left in the middle of the procedure.
I'm on top of it.
for how long?
I don't know.
but... in the meantime,
I can still do some good.
and when I can't,
I'll stop.
but that day's not here yet.
doctor...
that day has passed.
Valerie says she was alone.
boyfriend says he was at the marina.
what if we're off track?
what if the murder of the real estate agent was a crime of opportunity?
what if it's unrelated to the rape?
open houses are sitting ducks.
Yeah, somebody goes in there to rob the place.
real estate agent gets in the way.
what about overkill?
overkill doesn't have to mean personal.
Valerie Naff's on the news.
on October 8, 1999, in a court of law, suffering from the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder,
I, Valerie Naff, identified Brian Lexington as the man who raped me.
I now know that this allegation is incorrect, and I recant my statement.
I would like to offer my sincerest apologies to Brian Lexington and his family.
a public statement. That's odd timing.
Horatio, it's Calleigh.
you're not gonna believe this.
that's all for now.
I don't have anything else to say.
I said it all in my press conference.
that's quite a change of heart.
I felt bad for him.
it was my testimony that put him behind bars.
Valerie, the other day, I witnessed a conversation between you and Brian at your house.
what was the substance of it?
: what difference does it make?
it makes a big difference, and here's why.
I think he invited you to join the lawsuit against the county.
you accepted knowing that the jury will award him triple if he has the victim...
you know I'm right.
don't you judge me.
I deserve whatever I can get.
that night changed everything.
I have never been the same.
Valerie, somebody wanted the man who raped you dead.
now, I'm beginning to think it's Brian.
Valerie, he has a fixation with you that is common knowledge.
he did call me, and he said that he thought Jeff was a suspect.
excuse me.
Brian Lexington-- scoop him up, please.
do you think Brian Lexington killed Jeff Colson?
he had six years to think about it, Valerie.
we're not running on a whole lot of physical evidence, Alexx.
is our victim going to be able to help us?
real estate man put up quite a fight.
forearm bruising indicates self-defense.
but it didn't stop him from being punched like a heavy bag.
three cracked ribs and a bruised pancreas.
so what killed him?
intracranial hemorrhaging.
four depressed skull fractures to the parietal bone.
that's what killed him.
Horatio showed me the potential murder weapon from the house file.
a marble sculpture.
and these two marks seem consistent.
if someone hit you four times with,
I don't know, say a tire iron, your head would break apart like Humpty Dumpty.
but his skull only cracked.
what does that mean, that the killer let up?
or your killer was hurt in the fight.
sustained some kind of injury.
wait a minute.
what?
could be an old injury.
Brian Lexington's file said that he gobeat up in jail.
he got stabbed.
I'm going to pull his medical records, and I'm going to see how bad.
thank you, Alexx.
man: Is my client a suspect in your murder investigation?
we're sure as hell not here to sip tea, Hammett.
why would I kill Jeff Colson?
because he put you in prison for six years.
I've moved on with my life.
Yes, but that's not what your lawsuit says.
HAMMETT: Look, you filed a subpoena for my client's medical records.
questions about a stab wound he sustained in prison.
this man received a clean bill of health when he was released.
be that as it may,
I want him to raise his hands over his head right now.
HAMMETT: As you can see, my client isn't handicapped.
full range of motion.
I think we've answered all your questions.
not all my questions, counselor.
Brian, how did you know that Jeff Colson was the rapist?
there are leaks out there.
you just have to know where to find them.
HAMMETT: Don't...
say another word.
we're leaving.
the victim was a rapist, lieutenant.
refocus your efforts.
move on.
thank you, counselor.
noted.
this guy's too stupid.
I missed a step somewhere.
I'll keep digging.
I want to take a look at the attorney, Frank.
he's involved.
can I stick this warrant under his nose?
I need a signature.
I'm here for a pickup.
Jessica: Hold on, honey.
you going to sign it?
Oh, right.
Yeah-yeah, it was a warrant.
last name was "Colson ."
Frank, how many discussions do we need on Brian Lexington before you move on?
this isn't about your client.
it's about you.
what's the problem?
let's start with bribing messengers.
Bribing? What?
cut the performance, Hammett.
I got a 20-year-old gofer at Liaison Messenger Service practically has your number on his speed-dial.
how much cash did you slip in his pocket to get an inside track on search warrants?
: not enough, apparently.
information on your rape investigation helps me poke holes in the old one.
it strengthens my client's civil suit.
you told your client we were on to Jeff Colson.
now, that sounds like conspiracy to me.
I never thought it would lead to his murder.
well, you thought wrong.
at the very least, the Florida State Bar Association will have something to say about this.
you're going to be flipping burgers when it's all said and done.
Where'd you get the new photo?
owners of the house.
they'd planned to auction this before it disappeared.
it weighed in at 25 pounds.
Oh, yeah?
check this out.
Valerie's boyfriend, Doug Stets, was admitted to Dade Memorial Hospital
august 19, 2003, for emergency surgery.
what kind of surgery?
Oh, my God.
we should send a car over to the marina right away.
man: Okay, yeah. Yeah.
I punched him a few times to send him a message.
but that's it.
you killed him, Doug, because he raped your girlfriend.
raise your arms above your head.
do it, Doug.
TRIPP: Both arms, smart-ass.
can't do it, can you?
it's a shoulder strain.
I play baseball on weekends.
Caine: But that's not where you got your injury, is it, Doug?
you sustained a permanent injury on a job site.
what's that?
it's a hospital record that describes how your shoulder was broken and your axillary nerve was severed.
Yeah, I broke my shoulder. So what?
nerve damage, Doug.
Colson took lots of body shots because you couldn't raise your arm.
and the murder weapon, that statue, weighs 25 pounds.
I didn't swing that.
TRIPP: You couldn't.
least not very well.
that's why you only cracked his skull instead of splitting it open.
Hey, Frank.
excuse me, Doug.
the killer has limited upper-body strength.
so, it's him.
no, it's a woman.
you killed Jeff, Valerie.
I thought if I joined the lawsuit, that it would make it better.
but no dollar amount is going to make me right again.
he found me this house.
you know, I trusted him.
I believed him when he told me that Brian raped me.
and then when I found out that it was Jeff, it's just, I...
I saw his face everywhere.
it just haunted me.
he wasn't a man spending his life behind bars.
he was living it like nothing had ever happened.
like...
he had no memory of what he did to me.
I trusted you.
I trusted you!
you understand why I did what I did?
Valerie, you were in a very difficult position.
so you approve?
no.
I don't approve.
but I understand how you got there.
what's going to happen to me?
whatever it is...
I'm going to walk you through it.
you're right.
what happened here, Frank?
people gathered for a concert.
next thing you know, two shots ring out.
these two get dropped.
witnesses?
those who stuck around didn't see or hear anything.
just another day in Miami.
well, Frank...
take a look at this.
these three points converge to from a pitchfork.
does that seem familiar to you?
mala Noche.
so they've made their way to the beach.
who's the lady?
license ID'd her as, uh, Claire Trinner.
nice business dress, probably on her break, got caught in the crossfire.
that's what happens when worlds collide.
hell of a place for a gang shooting.
we found two casings out by the curb.
they're both . 223s.
that's an assault rifle, isn't it?
and a Noche caliber.
the music was loud enough so they didn't hear the gunfire, but they did hear the tires squeal.
seems consistent with a drive-by.
the rest of it isn't.
there were only two shots, precision-fired.
you know gang shootings.
they usually spray multiple bullets.
so Jose was targeted.
I'll get the bullets ASAP.
see if that'll help.
I appreciate it.
Hey.
they said I might find you here.
I, um, I was just hoping to talk to you for a second.
sure. What's going on?
I had a wonderful time last night.
so did I.
I'm just worried about you.
me? Why?
you made my arrest go away.
I'm just, I'm afraid that somebody could twist that, turn it into something ugly.
first of all,
I don't want you to worry about that, all right?
and, uh,
Marisol, what's bothering you?
it's my brother. Eric.
I just, I don't want to do anything to interrupt, disrupt what you guys have.
I mean, you're his boss.
okay, um, how about if I talk to Eric?
you would do that?
of course I would.
okay then. Um...
I guess I, uh, I have to go back to work.
okay. Uh...
okay. All right.
we'll, uh... We'll talk later.
all right. Till then.
Yeah.
take a look at this, Horatio.
some kind of white residue.
now, these two were in close proximity, so he may have smeared it on her.
okay, let's get that to Trace.
there's one more thing.
his Noche tat.
now, some of this is red ink, and some of it's blood.
but it takes a couple of days for a tattoo to set.
that notch makes ten, Alexx.
and the red ink means he got a promotion.
red ink's more than a promotion.
this man got made. Hang on a second.
Eric, I want to find out who does the tattoo work for the Mala Noche.
take Frank with you.
thank you, Alexx.
hold that right there.
be right back.
I hear you do the ink for all the Noches in Miami.
Yeah, I do ink for a lot of people.
what, you looking for a tat?
do I look like I want one?
we're here for info.
you're in the wrong place, brother.
well, I'm gonna tell you something, brother.
your pal Jose Sambrano's dead.
he was a useless punk.
good at B&Es, but he's better at getting caught.
Yeah, you tatted him up a few days ago.
Yeah, I know skin, not names.
then you better recognize this.
Yeah, he was here last week.
I just got made. That's number ten, bro.
I count that, brother.
much congrats.
this one's on the house.
who wants him dead?
I don't know. I do tats.
try to stay out of people's business.
who's in the picture with Jose?
whose arm is that next to him?
I had to try, right?
I'm gonna keep it anyway.
if that means you're leaving, be my guest.
I got to get back to work.
work?
how'd we do?
I'm taking a look at the bullets that Alexx pulled out of the body.
the striations are odd.
odd how? Well, the . 223
has a twist, six right.
but the bullet was grooved in addition to the striation, so something definitely acted upon it after it left the barrel.
somebody used a silencer, didn't they?
that's what I'm thinking.
a silencer would leave its own striae, independent of a firearm.
people toss firearms, but they keep silencers, don't they?
they're more expensive and harder to get.
I'm gonna run the information through IBIS and see if maybe it was used on another gun.
if we can find the silencer, Calleigh, we find the killer.
aaron, you get results on the trace that Alexx sent you?
stuff off the woman's leg? No.
no? What's the problem.
doesn't mean I didn't run it.
it doesn't exist.
it's not in our library?
or the FBI's.
you think you can sketch the compound based on the spectra?
it's like a blueprint.
I convert each peak into its functional group and determine the chemical structure of the compound.
it's been a while since organic chemistry, but I'll give it a shot.
okay. Good luck with that.
Yeah.
you obviously want the guy we can't see.
so obvious, I don't even have to answer.
okay...
let's lose Jose.
I hope we find something.
we only started logging tats a year ago.
Oh, that's more than enough time for a lot of these guys to make the cut.
so Jose's dead.
come on, Carlos. You knew that already.
eh, I heard about it.
some drive-by.
that's what you wanted us to think, Carlos.
I don't want anything.
but you know what? We do.
jose was made. He should have been safe.
his tattoo told you that.
why don't you tell me, Carlos?
why aren't you talking to the rival gangs?
because we like you for this.
so you picked up a silencer, you chose a target, and an innocent woman got shot in the crossfire, right?
maybe she was the target, huh?
I'm not saying nothing.
get him out of here.
what next?
we figure out the relationship between Claire Trinner and the Noche,
excuse me.
someone did not take the on-line harassment seminar.
is that how you feel, harassed?
maybe.
you wish.
what are you doing?
I'm working.
looking for the Callahan case.
I've got to rerun some DNA evidence.
okay. Let me help.
so, you really like that stuff, huh?
what stuff?
that green stuff.
Yeah. I drink it.
I drink it.
whatever.
well, I picked up a bottle for you.
I put it on my shelf, way in the back.
I found it.
stop it.
Hey, Eric.
Hey.
Hey.
Hi, Natalia.
Hi. Thank you.
I just wanted to update...
you're welcome.
big help. Yeah.
never mind.
I think Wolfe knows now.
so...
I failed Organic.
what the hell is this?
tell you what it isn't:
a street drug.
it's a derivative of atorvastatin calcium.
which is an analgesic used in pain medications.
so all that work, and it didn't help?
no, it, uh, puts things in perspective.
Meaning?
homicide ran our victim, Claire Trinner.
she worked at a company called Cantor Pharmaceutical.
she was the, uh, head of PR.
that helps explain where the sample came from, but not what it is.
then it's time to figure it out, and why it's worth killing over.
here's the cost analysis for Alyssa.
Thanks, Andrew.
when can we see Alyssa?
she's still in her meeting.
you sure I can't get you anything?
water?
no, we're fine. Thank you.
no, actually, I'd-I'd like a water, please.
thank you.
that Sally, she is something, huh?
what do you guys do?
we're just here to talk to your boss.
well, I-I guess she's technically my boss.
you guys from Iten Drugs?
we're from the county.
the county? Wow.
trouble brewing?
Sally, could you...
Alyssa Prince. You're with the crime lab.
Yeah. Eric Delko. This is Ryan Wolfe.
Hi. Please.
tell Sally no interruptions, okay?
of course, Miss Prince.
nice.
well, a CEO's office really is her home.
do you have any leads on what happened to Claire?
the news is saying it's gang-related.
where were you this morning?
I know you have to ask that, so I'll dignify it.
I was on a teleconference with Europe all morning.
uh, Claire had traces of this substance on her.
it appears to be an analgesic, but there's no substances that match in our database.
it's called Xorax.
it'll take care of everything from a toothache to a migraine, and all over the counter.
is it on the market yet?
we're awaiting FDA approval today.
once we get it, look out.
did Claire have occasion to handle the drug?
no.
then why did she have it on her?
I have no idea.
so, who does handle the drug?
our head of research, Paul Burton.
you're the chemist.
this is about Claire, huh?
she sure picked a bad day to die.
she didn't exactly pick the day, Mr. Burton.
you know what I mean.
no, I don't think I do.
now, the drug that's awaiting FDA approval
how'd it end up on Claire's thigh?
I don't know.
we, um... we checked with security, Paul, and they said you got back late from lunch.
where were you?
Claire was teaching me how to dance.
dance?
you might be surprised to know that I have a girlfriend who loves to dance.
and me, I've got two left feet.
Claire's been using her lunch breaks to teach me.
we go to a local studio.
uh, place your hand here.
like this? Perfect.
that's called the Llevada.
now you're going to carry me back across the floor.
sorry. That's okay.
there's only one problem with that, Mr. Burton.
yeah? What?
you use gloves to handle the drugs at all times.
there's no way it would've been on your fingers.
I've been sneaking Xorax, okay?
to relieve my muscle pain from the dancing.
okay.
for a guy who claims he has nothing to hide, you sure do seem guilty.
Yeah, well, I'm not, no matter what that stupid blog says.
I was just learning how to dance.
blog?
blog? What blog?
that's why you came down here, isn't it?
it's a company blog.
I don't know who writes it, but they get all their facts wrong.
why don't you give us the link?
maybe they got something right.
here... but it's just gossip in print.
these are from today.
I guess the nicknames keep you from getting fired.
Yeah, well, they don't help us much.
take a look at the next entry.
everything you never wanted to know about the people you work with.
every entry has motive.
we just got to figure out who's who.
I wonder what a blog about this place would say.
you and Boa Vista?
you're crazy, man. Come on.
I saw you guys.
we weren't doing anything.
Oh, okay. I'm actually glad I saw you guys.
yeah? Why?
I was, uh...
I was thinking of asking her out.
you?
she came by my crime scene a couple weeks ago.
I thought she might be interested.
no. She was probably just looking for me.
no, you know what? It's actually probably better this way.
yeah? Why is that?
well, office relationships usually end badly.
all right, there's one more entry.
take a look.
the Hardy Boys. Hey, they're talking about us.
they're clueless, but the girls at work are psyched.
one of them looks like A-Rod.
mm, A-Rod-- I get that all the time.
Really? You don't get Ricky Martin?
no. I don't.
the other one looks like, uh,
actually, uh, it's Gyllenhaal.
Oh. Yeah. He's a movie star or something.
okay, so that's why you wear your movie star jackets?
actually, it's-it's in the eyes.
I get it all the time, A-Rod.
you get it in the eyes all the time?
all right, well, whoever's blogging is doing this from their desk.
how do you think it relates to the Noches?
for all we know, they could be Pablo.
we get a hit?
you bet.
sometimes, a liability becomes an asset.
the groove.
bullet from an earlier crime definitely passed through the same silencer.
crime happened two days ago.
it was an armed robbery of a little botanica down by the Roads.
suspect's name is, uh, Mario Pilar.
where is Mario right now?
he's waiting for prelim. He didn't make a statement.
break his silence, Calleigh.
I'm on it.
I got a bullet from a murder today that matches the silencer from the robbery you were picked up on two days ago.
that botanica?
please believe me, I'm innocent.
Mario, you've been charged with armed robbery.
you had gunshot residue on your hands when they arrested you outside the store.
I was set up by the Mala Noches.
I keep trying to tell you guys that.
I just moved here from Panama.
I got work right away in nice houses.
what were you doing at the store?
buying breakfast.
I was on my way to work.
you just happen to be outside the botanica when the Mala Noches robbed it?
I stand there every morning, drinking my coffee.
they ran out, and someone threw the gun at me.
I just picked it up.
I... I didn't even hear a shot.
when they handed you the gun, was there a silencer on it?
I don't know what that is.
the gun looked regular.
I tossed it in the trash.
the police tied it to me.
you said nice houses.
I landscape.
I need you to write down the addresses of those houses for me.
if you don't, I can't help you.
heard you talked to our boy.
he's obviously terrified of the Mala Noches, but he did help us.
nice addresses.
he landscapes in The Gables,
hibiscus Island, Miramar.
so this is where they're hiding their weapons.
Yeah, when there's too much police presence in their territory, they go upscale.
hang on a second. This Hibiscus address.
that's Claire Trinner's.
our victim?
worlds collide.
Mr. Trinner.
you want to come out of there, please?
I know this doesn't look good.
well, this is as far from good as anything could look.
I got the news about Claire this morning.
I'm devastated.
I can see your grief.
who's the young lady?
Cindy lives next door.
she saw it on the news.
came over to check on me.
I love my wife.
what do you think we'll find when we take a look in your pool house?
what? I don't know.
what do you think you'll find?
I don't know.
maybe you let a gang keep an arsenal in it.
why would I do that?
so they could kill your wife.
you could swim with Cindy every other afternoon.
does that sound like an accurate description?
you won't find anything.
I never made a deal with anyone to kill my wife.
but you are banging the neighbor lady.
we call that motive.
Yes, we do.
Mr. Wolfe.
heard you picked up Claire Trinner's husband.
no weapons found, but he's definitely a suspect.
the company blog.
found no less than four different people at that company who are either having affairs or getting into some other sort of trouble.
who are they?
that's the problem.
everyone's name is in code.
so break the code, Mr. Wolfe. Break it.
will do.
you guys just can't get enough of me today, can you?
don't let it go to your head.
this head?
no, never.
so, okay... time to find your blogger.
can you do that?
I thought all the information provided was false.
it was- as far as the blogger knew.
but the one detail that has to be legit to start a blog is the email address.
okay, great. Let's look at that.
not so simple.
first, I have to track it back to its server.
I do that by using the base address.
which is blogdaze. com.
exactly.
and we know by reading, that entries were made at 8: 04, 9: 56 and 12: 20.
so I just type in these entries.
and that's the IP address, right?
you're catching on. That's cute.
so, we just convert that to its attendant email and...
well, I'll be.
it's the perky assistant.
Hey, guys.
is there a problem?
well, if we tell you, how soon does it end up on your blog?
what?
drop the act, Sally.
we know you're the beginning and end of information around here.
you can check my computer.
I'm not doing anything.
that's because company policy states you can't use their computers to write a blog.
and I follow company policy to a T.
Yeah, right.
do me a favor.
just move back for a second, please.
thank you.
at least you wrote nice stuff about us.
right, A-Rod?
this is very sneaky, Sally.
what the hell is that?
it's a virtual keyboard.
bluetooth this to your PDA and you can use it like a regular keyboard.
how does it work?
two lasers are projected- one creates the keypad, and the other one can tell which letters you're hitting once you break the horizontal plane.
okay. So I have a blog.
what's that prove?
we'll see when you decipher those names for us.
fine.
how often are these desks cleaned?
every day. Why?
just means that your prints are fresh.
you'll be able to lift prints from that mess?
sometimes the prints themselves aren't as important as where they're found.
but I just told you I'll decode it.
that doesn't mean you're not still hiding something.
so what now?
we're looking for hidden motives.
okay.
the more a key got hit, the darker green it appears.
so we got the usual suspects-- the 'e,' the 's,' the 't.'
Yeah, but there's a bunch on 'x.'
true.
so?
so, look at the most recent blogs.
you see any 'x's?
maybe she sent a message to someone else.
no, I don't think so.
look at the last sentence.
stay tuned for this week's highlights.
guess that's not gonna happen.
or it already did.
bloggers like to hide messages in the text.
they choose a font the same color as the background.
you have to highlight it to read it.
and then read between the lines.
Uh-oh.
looks like Sally was sharing company secrets.
and there's only one other person that would have that info before she did.
the CEO. No.
look at the time of the last blog.
8: 04 a. m.
we know she was on a teleconference call at that time.
so that leaves just one other person.
you need to put on a lab coat.
Oh, no, I don't.
you need to tell me the truth.
about what?
about everything.
let's start with the FDA approval.
you knew this morning that you didn't get it.
not true.
you told Sally and she posted it on her blog.
look, please don't get her into trouble.
she's just trying to help.
and then you started dumping your shares...
which I call motive.
for what?
for wanting Claire dead.
I mean, it's her job to announce all the findings, no matter how bad they are.
she is the head of PR.
you can't prove anything.
well, the SEC can.
and then I'll be back.
so no luck, huh?
Yeah. Ran warrants on all of Mario's employers.
most people don't even have an outside storage area.
the ones that did came up clean.
do you mind?
I'm gonna cross-check all the names
if there is a dot, this'll connect them.
two of the people he landscaped for attended the University of Florida.
another two drove Mercedes, although that's not too compelling.
three of them work for Cantor Pharmaceutical.
what does that mean?
it means they share their help.
and Mario's holding out on us.
you lied to me, didn't you?
I didn't.
no, I know, Mario, that this is a high-risk situation for you.
the Noches are everywhere.
are you going to help me or not, Mario?
what do you need to know?
someone is missing from your list.
and I need to know who it is right now.
I will die.
I am your last chance.
miss Prince.
what's going on?
I just came home to feed my dogs.
well, your dogs are going to have to wait.
what's this about?
I have a warrant to search your premises, ma'am.
search my premises?
for guns, ma'am.
what else did you get?
Boxes- just got to open them up.
get them to Firearms.
ms. Prince?
would you come with me, please?
we found an arsenal in your shed, Ms. Prince- guns, ammunition.
I promise you I had no idea that those were in there.
the gardener shows up when I'm not home.
I need a list of the names of the people that come to your house.
I don't know the yard people.
or the pool man.
Sally takes care of these things for me.
Sally, your assistant.
Yes.
there was one...
one nice young man, uh, who used to come.
the young man's name is Mario Pilar.
that's him.
he must have moved on, but his friends keep showing up and I figured as long as the work gets done.
you're aware that the Mala Noche killed Claire Trinner, aren't you?
I had nothing to do with that.
so, until you can prove otherwise,
I'll be at the office.
this is the arsenal from Alyssa Prince's house.
any sign of our murder weapon?
chances are it's not here.
but these are.
silencers.
I found two of them.
I just have to finish unpacking, see what I'm dealing with.
we can solve a lot of cases with these.
well, let's slam the door on this one first.
you hit the jackpot?
almost.
this was the silencer used in the beach killing.
so what's the problem?
no problem.
I feel like there's something more on it.
Oh, yeah, there's a thin film of something.
may I?
trace from the exterior of the silencer contained isopropanol and trimethyl ammonium chloride.
liquid flux.
Yeah, used in the manufacture of needles to solder them to needle arms.
you think it was someone back at Cantor Pharmaceutical?
I think somebody's using these needles for something else, Mr. Wolfe.
nice ride.
stay right where you are.
a lot of nice artwork here, Hector.
you make your own equipment, don't you?
needles, that sort of thing.
Yeah, it cuts down overhead.
Yes, but it has a nasty habit of implicating you, Hector.
in what?
in a murder.
you left evidence on the silencer.
should have never given Jose that tat.
is that how you got picked for the job?
catch you later, Carlos.
Yeah.
you just gave him his mark? Without checking?
nobody would ask for one without earning it, man.
jose just did.
make it right.
go to the shed, and get a piece.
okay.
I'm sorry, boss.
I need you to take care of someone else, too.
so, what, Claire was just a bonus?
jose thought he was supposed to kidnap her.
got them close enough to do the deed.
that's cold.
it was either him or me.
Hector, I want to know who hired the Noches to kill Claire.
that I don't know.
then how'd you know who to kill?
got a picture.
Where's the picture now?
second drawer.
check it.
there's trace on it, H.
see? I'm cooperating.
Yes.
too little, too late, Hector.
the picture had Xorax all over it.
so listen, whoever hired the Noches to kill Claire definitely worked at Cantor Pharmaceutical.
paul Burton just lawyered up.
the chemist?
we got him for insider trading.
okay.
Yeah, I definitely don't think that he put the hit out on Claire.
well, who else could it be?
he's the only one that handled the drugs, and it was all over the picture.
someone was handling him.
he mentioned a girlfriend.
and since he spent every waking moment at the lab...
he must have met her there.
I understand when lovebirds work together, they steal time whenever they can.
Ryan say something to you?
about what?
never mind.
no, really, what are you talking about?
nothing. Forget about it.
I'm gonna go back to that office and find Burton's girlfriend.
based on...?
an educated guess.
this is becoming a real inconvenience.
I've got a lot of damage control to do here at the company.
you've got quite a bit to do with me, too.
like what?
like why you hired a Mala Noche member to kill Claire Trinner.
that's absurd.
no, it's not absurd, Alyssa. It's the truth.
now we found the guns at your house, and Hector gave us a picture of Claire.
why would I want her dead?
because you thought she was sleeping with your boyfriend.
Sally decoded everything.
paul and Claire were Igor and Inga.
you were Pablo, as in Escobar, head of the drug cartel.
the blog made it clear they were sneaking off together, every day.
the whole office knew.
and that just burned you up, didn't it?
Yes.
paul and I made a great team.
Claire- she had no right.
so do as I say, not as I do.
it's my company.
not for long.
now, how did you meet the Mala Noches?
through Mario?
he was clearly scared of them.
then I saw them putting guns in my shed.
and instead of being frightened, you turned it around, hired them to kill Claire.
I don't like to lose.
I don't want to know anything about it except that it's happened and soon. You got the cash?
this is her.
just get it done.
you're one crazy lady.
you know what's sad about this, Alyssa?
you were wrong.
about what?
Claire was teaching Paul how to dance...
to make you happy.
obviously, that was a waste of time.
guess everyone's out for one of their own today.
certainly looks that way, doesn't it?
Yeah. Eric...
I heard.
Marisol made you dinner last night.
she did.
Yeah.
look, I was a little freaked out about my boss seeing my sister.
but seeing how happy she is, I can't argue with it.
no concerns?
none for her.
but you need to know that she's a lot sicker than she looks.
doctors think, uh... months.
can you live with that?
I can.
all right.
we are gonna be all right.
turn around!
it wasn't us. You got it wrong.
don't lie to me.
if we took that money-- think about it
would we be standing here with you?
I said, turn around!
don't shoot, please!
put your hands up! We're telling you the truth.
Oh, man, check this out.
everyone came through here.
Sinatra, his Rat Pack...
Yeah, I know, Capone. Fascinating.
look, we're running out of room in my truck.
and that light in the window,
that's the sun.
look at the gold leafing on these pillars.
we can't take the pillars, Wayno.
new owner will strip it down, slap a coat of white gloss over the whole thing.
at least it'd brighten this place up.
this place gives me the creeps.
Hey, check behind the concierge desk.
there might be some cool stuff.
there's nothing back here.
TJ, you okay?
deep breaths.
hang in there, sir.
both guys were shot in the back of the head.
execution-style.
one rots, one lives-- for now.
ids?
they're brothers.
mariano and Garcia Vargas.
and get this:
those young kids called it in.
they, uh, Wayne Leonard and Tom Jennings.
call themselves urban explorers.
fancy label for pilfering.
hotel was scheduled to be gutted next week.
let's contact the owner.
the boys were inside looking for souvenirs.
they found more than that.
you going to visit that guy in the hospital?
uh...
no comment.
saw him go in the ambulance. Head wound.
doubt you'll get anything out of him.
that's why we rely on evidence, like his clothes and his property.
this building's the perfect place for a cover-up.
a cover-up. You're kidding.
anything in there's going to be rubble soon.
Erica, why are you looking for a story in this?
it's just another day in Miami.
don't make this bigger than it is.
bigger opens doors for me in Atlanta.
Yeah, well, fabricating stories closes doors for you in Miami.
room conditions, daylight cycle.
how long you think he's been in here?
well, my entomologist will confirm.
based on the size of this fly larvae, he's been here almost three days.
entrance wound says nine-mil or 38.
through-and-through.
Yeah, but through-and-through to where?
the direction of this spatter means the round could be all the way out in the street.
the other victim had a head wound, too, is that right?
Yeah, but that bullet isn't yours, Calleigh, honey.
it went on an ambulance ride.
he's critical.
and you think he lasted three days in here with him?
Yeah. Based on his level of dehydration, he went into the tub at the same time.
and he couldn't get out.
WOODS： The maggots devoured the infected tissue surrounding the entrance wound, keeping it clean.
and that's what kept him alive.
that's amazing.
I think he'd use other words to describe it.
man: Listen,
I don't know either one of these Vargas brothers.
I bought this old hotel with the idea that I would restore it to its original glory.
I noticed that you, uh... that you have no security.
my advisor told me to quit blowing money on it.
I figured there was nothing left to steal, so I cut back.
we're not talking about somebody walking away with a couple of lumpy mattresses.
someone took lives here.
listen, I understand, but I cannot afford delays.
my structural engineer says, if I file for an extension now,
I won't be cutting ribbon in 11 months.
Mm. I'm crying inside, Mr. Suero.
we'll need a list of employees from your contractor.
as well as everybody on your payroll.
we will...
be in touch.
TRIPP: This is Mariano Vargas's condo.
DELKO: Looks like we weren't the only ones interested in what the Vargas brothers were doing.
background check says he and Garcia were part-time janitors.
a lot of bags here.
what were they cleaning up with these?
well, something smells hinky.
I'll run his background.
looks like Mariano found work that paid better.
take a look at this.
well, that's a nice chunk of cabbage.
he was hiding money.
Yeah, but why?
illegal gambling, drugs?
never anything good.
we found his van down in the parking lot.
we'll have it impounded.
let me get this back to the lab, see where it takes us.
Hey, Calleigh.
Hey.
these the bills you called me about?
Yeah. I was wondering if you could run the serial numbers.
sure. I'll run the plate and stack numbers, too.
see what comes up in the system.
great. So, we're working together on this one?
you called, Cal.
for an expert opinion.
do not try and bigfoot my case.
is this the way it's gonna be?
what?
from now on, you and I, just 'cause I got engaged?
it is not because you got engaged.
it is because you didn't tell me.
I was looking for the right time.
there is no right time. You just have to stand and deliver.
so, do you think you can find anything else off these bills?
okay, my hundred-dollar bill, all right?
must be nice to work for the feds.
you see the difference?
yeah the portrait of Benjamin Franklin's bigger.
Mm-hmm. That's not all.
you see the gray 100 in the bottom left corner of the bill?
Yeah.
it's not gray.
it's actually the text USA100 imbedded a classified number of times within the bill.
that's a nice security feature to prevent counterfeiting.
it's called microprinting.
introduced in 1990 on this denomination.
now look at your mystery bill.
DUQUESNE: There's no microprinting.
your bill's at least 16 years old.
average hundred is normally in circulation for only nine.
so, how did these survive the cut?
these were kept underground.
I've seen this before on drug cartel cases.
you can't tell that by looking at them.
can, too. See the edges?
DUQUESNE: They're frayed. I noticed that.
you're looking at rat bites.
rat bites?
drug cartels have a cash flow problem.
too much currency to move, so while it sits, waiting to be laundered, rats snack on it.
does it help us?
only if you have something to compare it to.
it's a start.
the license plate on Mariano Vargas's van turned up something today.
a parking ticket in front of Miami-Dade Bank three days ago.
three days ago? That's the same day his brother died.
you tell that to H?
I'm gonna meet him over at the bank for a little knock-and-talk.
all right. Well, look, I can hook you up with some photos of the hundred-dollar bills.
somebody's got to start talking.
anybody try to pass on this currency at your bank that you know of?
no. This is outdated. It's damaged.
we would have taken this note out of circulation.
did someone tell you it came from here?
TRIPP: We recovered it from Mariano Vargas's apartment.
he got a parking ticket in front of your bank three days ago.
you recognize him?
no, I don't.
anything out of the ordinary happen that day around here?
not in the bank, no.
okay, well, how about outside the bank?
well, a client's car got stolen out by the ATM.
what kind of a car?
it was a, uh, a Corvette, I think. Red.
it was a red Corvette.
did your security cameras see anything?
unfortunately, no.
our ATM camera was down.
it was actually scheduled for service that afternoon.
that's convenient.
what are you insinuating?
Caine: I am insinuating no one is telling us anything, including you.
Horatio said a red Corvette was stolen outside Miami-Dade Bank.
TRIPP: Yeah, I'm searching the impound database.
we got a match.
Yeah, Leo and Sienna. Remember them?
that's the car they stole.
we caught them on the drawbridge with a bag of cash that same day we got the two-fer.
don't make me shoot you.
they're in County. Prelim's in 23 days.
wolfe: Hello?
Yeah, Wolfe. It's Delko.
listen, pull the evidence box on Leo Riggs and Sienna Stone.
from the drawbridge? Yeah. I think they might be connected to the shootings at the Delgado Hotel.
you got it. Thanks.
Thanks, Tripp.
okay, Leo and Sienna's case.
Yeah.
what did we recover from them?
uh...
nine-mil.
the arrest report said the gun was dirty.
could've been fired.
what caliber gun was used to shoot the Vargas brothers?
38 caliber, or a nine-mil.
and how much time between the Corvette being stolen and Leo and Sienna surrendering at the drawbridge?
an hour and a half.
that's plenty of time to meet the Vargas brothers at the Delgado Hotel and shoot them. Let's take a look at the money we caught them with.
$1, 200. Rest was donated to the citizens of Miami.
wait a minute. What?
rat bites.
what's that mean? -It means that Leo and Sienna were moving the same money as the Vargas brothers.
SIKES: You two seem to have an incredibly calm disposition, almost like you've been through this before.
well, Sienna and I aren't very good at staying out of trouble.
seems to follow us wherever we go.
having to return for a preliminary hearing
does that change anything for you?
we'll need one of those appointment books, I guess.
that's all for now. Back to you in the newsroom.
CAMERAMAN: And we're clear.
another roadblock.
we just have a question.
they've been released on bail, haven't they? I mean, we were live.
get that microphone out of here now.
SIKES: Okay, fine.
just don't start doing the badge thing.
we're off to the Fairmark. Can we do this there?
a couple mojitos may warm your blood.
what do you say? We'll pass.
the cash we caught you with on the drawbridge
Where'd it come from?
what's it matter? We gave it all away.
what? You don't watch the news?
mariano and Garcia Vargas. You know them?
no, sorry.
I can't say we do. So... we good?
they were shot at the Delgado Hotel.
one's in surgery. The other's dead.
so, no, we're not good.
such a violent city-- Miami.
protecting it must be such a burden.
you get off work, come meet us at the bar, okay?
they're tied to this.
well, we have their gun from the drawbridge.
we just don't have anything to match it to.
see if Mariano Vargas is out of surgery. We need that bullet.
I'll find it.
Hey! Come here for a second. I want to talk to you.
do you realize what you're doing?
what am I doing?
these people are into something.
cartel money, murder.
they're dangerous.
what cartel? What kind of drugs?
I haven't gotten it out of them yet.
Erica, this isn't a game show.
you could be putting yourself in harm's way.
this is my career.
you go to the hospital?
Yeah, just got back. You get the bullet?
no. They can't give it to us.
the surgeon says it's a nine-millimeter round, and it's the only thing keeping Mariano Vargas alive.
they pull it out of him, he's gonna bleed to death.
the hospital did give me his clothes and his personal property.
I was gonna run it over to trace.
okay, before you do, go back to the hotel and get the second bullet.
through-and-through that killed Garcia. That's the one.
I thought Peter Elliott was helping us.
he is. At my request.
doesn't want to get his, uh, pretty suit dirty?
where is he? I don't know.
maybe he's e-mailing Quantico...
having lunch with his fiancee...
any luck finding the bullet on the street?
Oh, a couple guys with metal detectors.
we're striking out.
well...
we know it has to be on this end of the room, because the direction of the blood spatter on the sink means the round would have had to travel that way.
maybe it never made it outside.
there's a dust void.
I think the bullet hit whatever was here.
those teenagers combing through this place.
I think I'll find out what they went home with.
how long have you been doing this?
uh... about a year.
you call yourself an urban explorer, but you do realize you're a thief.
look, nobody wants this stuff.
if they did, it wouldn't just be lying around.
it's still private property, Wayne. Think about it.
is this from the Delgado Hotel?
Yeah, it's a Royal Quiet Deluxe.
1952 model; I grabbed it before the cops came.
the model comes with a bullet.
is it new or old?
it's old enough.
the typewriter round's pretty mangled.
too mangled to work with?
I had enough to tell that the striations didn't match.
so, Leo and Sienna's gun from the drawbridge was not used on the Vargas brothers. Correct.
they didn't kill them, but they did have some of their money.
I don't know. Maybe they were couriers.
okay, it's time to pay them a visit.
come on, guys.
we only have four minutes till our live shot.
how do I look?
composition's better if your heads are closer together.
is it better if I move in like this?
hello.
what are you doing here?
well, Leo and Sienna mentioned mojitos at the Fairmark.
nobody said anything about the penthouse suite.
other markets want a piece of the action now.
DUQUESNE: So, you're hiding them.
I have to keep them under wraps if I want to have creative control over my story.
wolfe: I already warned you about this.
SIKES: Listen, Ryan: this is gonna get me on cable news.
looks like you're set up for an exclusive.
look at the ratings. They've tripled in three days.
people are launching Leo and Sienna Web sites. It's huge.
stay down, stay down!
is everybody okay?
you see muzzle flash out there?
no. Nothing. Shooter could be anywhere.
this is CSI Duquesne. We've got shots fired at the Fairmark Hotel.
requesting immediate backup.
they say I have to go to the ER. Am I...?
they just want to make sure they got all the glass out.
but the EMT says you're fine.
you're dying to say "I told you so," aren't you?
no. I'm not. I'm just glad it wasn't worse.
maybe I'm crazy, but for a big story,
I don't mind a little flesh wound. You are crazy.
you got a nail through your eye on a case. How's that different?
well, for one thing, Erica, I'm a cop.
get to the hospital.
who's trying to kill you, Leo?
I was hoping you could tell us.
it's gotta be some crazed groupie.
we have a huge fan base.
this is not a fan. You threw somebody else's money off the drawbridge.
and now they're coming to get you.
when Sienna and I stole that car, the money was already in it.
and that's as far as our story goes.
Leo, in my humble opinion, you're over your head.
well, that's all I got.
until you find something more-- nice knowing ya.
I am offering you police protection right now.
I'll take my chances.
you're making a mistake.
SIENNA: You done, Leo?
leo: We're outta here.
Sonny and Cher came into this city with the clothes on their back.
when we arrested them, all they had was a gun and that bag of money.
what about the car?
PD tow yard released it yesterday.
to who?
back to the registered owner. Okay, Frank, bring him in here before somebody else dies.
you're the registered owner of a car that's been pretty busy lately.
are you involved in this?
involved in what? Look, this whole
Leo and Sienna thing on the news-- it doesn't involve me.
police report said you left the keys in the ignition outside the bank.
did you leave your brain in the glove compartment, too?
I mean, who does that?
all right.
look, I just couldn't keep up with the payments.
so you wanted to ditch the vehicle.
figured I'd collect some insurance, cut my losses.
and it happened real quick.
you know, corner of my eye,
I see this couple approaching down the sidewalk.
you put it on a platter, man.
have a nice day!
it was supposed to just disappear, right?
I mean, that's what happens when a car gets stolen.
mine ends up on the Leo and Sienna show
drawbridges and flying money.
that money came from your car.
if I had a bag of cash sitting in my car, why would I be stopping at an ATM?
they grabbed a bag out of a van parked near my car.
you wanna?
I don't wanna go there no more.
SIENNA: You don't even know what's in there.
we're in front of a bank, baby.
let's take one and find out. I love you.
the bag that Leo was carrying was heavy, wasn't it?
he was struggling with it, yeah.
units on the scene said Sienna was waving the bag all over the place.
which means we're missing a whole lot of dough.
Yes, it does-- back to the car.
I know where the rest of Leo and Sienna's money went.
both door panels were pulled and stuffed.
there's got to be over a million dollars there, Eric, stashed before they got to the drawbridge.
maybe they were going to come back for the car after it got released from the impound.
but we beat them to it, Eric.
looks like it was munched by rats.
it's probably cartel money.
they're safer without it.
not if the shooter thinks they still have it.
wolfe: Hey.
Hey. Is that the one of the rounds from the penthouse?
I pulled it out of the wall after EMT took Erica away.
is she still at the hospital? I doubt it.
she thinks this story's going to take her to cable news.
well, it may.
the gun used at the Fairmark penthouse also fired the round that killed Garcia Vargas that I pulled from the typewriter.
DUQUESNE: They match striations.
the Vargas brothers paid for the missing million with their lives.
Leo and Sienna are going to be next.
so, what do you want to do?
chase Leo and Sienna or who's after them?
I think we need to find the source of that cash.
the camera at the ATM at the bank was out of order.
could have been helpful.
mariano had a parking ticket in front of Miami-Dade Bank.
what about the parking meters?
aren't they testing the new ones at 23rd Street?
DUQUESNE: Prototype parking meter looks like a gas pump.
photo Violation Meter-- it's brand-new.
I pulled these shots off of Violation Link.
that's Garcia Vargas carrying the bags.
Yeah, but take a look.
he wasn't taking them into the bank.
he's loading them in the van.
Horatio's going to want to have another chat with our banker.
Mr. Adams, Leo Riggs and Sienna Stone stole a million dollars in drug profits from this bank.
I can't say anything. I can't. I...
you got to understand.
he will kill my family.
I do understand, so protect your family and talk to me.
I had a deal with... Nicolas Suero.
owner of the Delgado Hotel.
Yeah, he sells his US currency to me.
I convert them into pesos for his family in Colombia.
and you deposit his US currency in Florida bank accounts.
makes him a rich man in two countries.
money laundering in the new millennium.
Yes. Why was the money taken out of this bank?
I was getting paranoid.
I didn't want to get caught around bad money, so I asked him to send his guys over to get the money out of here.
okay. And that's all you know?
Yes, that's all I know, and I swear.
I need you guys to understand something: Suero, he means...
he means what he says.
so do I.
Caine: Nicolas, I guess dirty money is a way into the real estate business, huh?
doesn't matter how hard you work, in this community, you get labeled.
here's what I'm after, Nicolas:
two men under your employ were shot at your hotel.
I want to know if you pulled the trigger, Nicolas.
why would I do something like that?
it works against everything that I'm trying to achieve.
look... I'm an idealist.
this hotel will breath life into our city, return some of its old luster...
Yes, and launder your drug money.
okay.
call me when you prove any of this.
it's been a real pleasure, Lieutenant.
don't go far.
H, I analyzed the stain on Mariano Vargas's shirt that Ryan got from the hospital.
what did you get?
all I got was some kind of transfer:
it's an aromatic hydrocarbon, tri-methyl benzene and an ultraviolet dye.
an ink.
Yeah, it's from a UV pen.
banks tend to use them to sign documents, prevent forgeries.
and to track money.
this bank manager is bad news.
adams: What's this about?
lieutenant Caine?
what's going on?
I have more to discuss with you, Mr. Adams.
don't know what else I can tell you.
ELLIOTT: We'll take it from here, Lieutenant.
Caine: Agent Elliott, what are you doing?
ELLIOTT: Department of Treasury is closing the bank.
$15 million in fraudulent loans to land developers in Florida and Louisiana in the last two years, fake socials, the works.
FinCEN and the SEC are involved.
you almost tipped the whole thing.
a heads-up would have been appreciated.
too many singing canaries in your lab, Horatio.
I am going to examine everything that you seize-- do you understand?
what we've uncovered in the last three years...
he'll do more federal time than he ever will for your murder.
why don't we let a court decide that?
I'll direct your request to my superiors.
what the hell happened?
I'm not sure.
well, I got another one for you.
Leo and Sienna just robbed a convenience store near Vizcaya.
leo: That's right: you're being robbed by Leo and Sienna.
SIENNA: Open the cash drawer.
took off with a few thousand dollars, and a civilian helped them get away.
now, do you believe that?
what's going on?
WFOR. Sikes is back on the hunt.
great.
SIKES: So Leo and Sienna asked if they could stay with you? Yeah.
SIKES: Were you aware that they just robbed a convenience store?
granger: No. I was just kind of excited to meet them.
SIKES: So you heard the shot?
sounded like a gunshot. Uh, I heard tires squealing.
came outside. Saw that my car was gone.
SIKES: Whose Cadillac is this in your driveway?
granger: I have no idea.
my silver BMW was gone, and it was there.
it's not mine.
and yet another disappearing act for Leo and Sienna.
they're on the run again.
this is Erica Sikes reporting live for CBS 4 News.
he heard gunfire.
they should have found them.
Leo and Sienna are in a silver BMW convertible.
what about the Cadillac?
it's registered to Nicolas Suero.
well, how do you like that?
why would he leave his car?
because maybe... maybe he ended up on the wrong end of the stick.
find them. I'm on it.
Caine: Agent Elliott.
found some documentation that may connect your banker Jason Adams to your Colombian Suero.
I'm still wrestling with the Inspector General for them.
thought you might want to take a look at this in the meantime.
a nine-mil.
that is what we're looking for.
found in his briefcase.
he was obviously surprised to see us.
okay, I need to search his residence now.
it's all yours. What's over there?
another surprise.
adams: What, what's that?
Caine: That is the gun that killed Garcia Vargas and put his brother in a coma, Jason.
we found it in your briefcase.
I didn't kill anybody.
Suero gave that to me. Told me to hide it.
Yeah, not quite.
adams: Laundry-- that's interesting.
that shirt was found at your house.
ink from a UV pen stained the breast pocket.
so what?
that same ink was transferred to Mariano Vargas.
and it puts you at the scene.
so let's start talking.
I told Suero to come get his money, to get it out of there.
then he sends those two goons over there.
mariano and Garcia delivered it to Suero a million dollars short.
you thought they stole the money.
when Suero calls me and tells me he's a mil short.
Yes, I did.
so I told Mariano and Vargas to meet me at the Delgado Hotel.
look, don't lie to me, all right? Don't!
it was all there when you left my bank!
wasn't us. You got it wrong.
if we took that money
think about it-- would we be standing here with you?
they look at me straight in the eye, tell me they had nothing to do with it.
turn around.
turn around!
now put your hands up!
DELKO: So killing them at the Delgado Hotel, leaving them in the bathtub, that was all a plan to set up Suero?
Suero threatens every member of my family, tells me he's going to kill them one at a time if I don't get his mil back.
after they lied to my face,
I go to Mariano's condo and I turn it upside down.
it's not there.
Caine: And when we came to visit you at the bank you realized that Sienna and Leo had Suero's money, right?
I saw them on television.
and I couldn't get near them.
but you got close enough, Jason.
my life is in serious danger over this.
they're ordering room service at the Fairmark penthouse.
I wasn't going to let them get away with it.
they didn't get away with it, Jason.
and neither will you.
the stolen BMW has a SunPass.
finally we get a break. Can we use that?
Yeah. Cooper says he got the court order.
that'll tell us where they're headed, at least.
DUQUESNE: Yeah, data's coming in. Okay.
sunpass recorded a paid toll at Golden Glades Toll Plaza.
it's headed east.
I guess they're leaving the state.
all of Monroe County is gonna be standing by when they get through.
is that them?
Yeah.
it's time.
we're going to make history.
drop the weapon! Drop the bag!
put your hands in the air!
I love you, baby.
I love you, Leo.
suspects have jumped the bridge.
requesting water recovery.
Suero came looking for his million.
wolfe: It proves Leo and Sienna are crazy.
they killed a cartel boss.
Hey, you okay?
field agent told me about the Leo and Sienna thing on the bridge. Crazy stuff.
word travels fast.
I'm surprised you're willing to set foot in our lab with all the information leaks around here.
if you're referring to our fraud case, I'm sorry.
you knew that bank was part of our investigation and you said nothing. The bank closure was in front of a judge.
if ownership found out, they could've blocked it.
there was too much at stake, Calleigh.
we're on the same team.
I know that.
but right now, your lab has a credibility problem.
we have to be careful until it blows over.
I don't think this is going to blow over.
every time I see you, there's a new reason not to trust you.
excuse me.
SIKES: And so here in Miami, on the Riverton Bridge, the story of Leo and Sienna comes to a tragic end.
lieutenant.
would you like to add a comment?
turn it off.
what do you want?
I want the tapes from the bridge.
I can't do that.
I have a responsibility to see this story through.
I have a responsibility to this city.
I didn't make them do what they did.
no, you didn't.
but you glamorized it.
everyone wants to see how this ends.
and you're going to be the first.
I want the tape.
I guess I'll see you on the next crime scene.
I'll be here.
Hello?
I'm watching you, babysitter.
who is this?
Justin, is that you?
I'm closer than you think.
who is this?
I'm in the house.
Oh, my gosh!
damn it, Justin, you scared me!
did you just say a cuss word?
you have no idea what...
wait here.
who's the girl, Frank?
girl's name is Heather Crowley, she's 16.
babysitting Justin Montavo, who's 12.
how's she holding up?
right now, not very well.
okay, who's our victim?
well, believe it or not, it's the babysitter's father.
what was he doing here?
not sure.
families are next door neighbors, though.
okay, the homeowners?
the Montavos, Dave and Renee.
no sign of them.
sounds like they were sharing more than a driveway, doesn't it?
that's the thing about these neighborhoods
big houses, big secrets.
Yes. They won't be secrets for long.
Heather, where do you think your mom is?
I don't know.
I keep calling her and calling her, and she doesn't answer.
do you think she's okay?
you know what? We're going to find her.
why don't you tell me what happened.
this whole night's been weird.
Montavos never came home.
and I saw this shadowy figure in the window, and then...
yeah?
excuse me.
what do you got, Frank?
take a look at this.
blood trail leads around to the back.
okay, Frank, follow it, and I'll catch up.
Heather, I'll be right back, okay?
you sit tight.
I hate to say it, she fits the description of the babysitter's mother.
so a bad night just got worse.
poor baby Heather.
witnessed her father die, and then id'd her mother half an hour later.
get a cod?
Yeah.
neck was slashed.
severed her carotid.
we got a blood pool here.
probably from where the father got assaulted.
think I found what killed the mom.
textured surface on this handle's going to be impossible to print.
instrument like that, blood all over the body, means the killer could have blood on them, too.
I'll test the witnesses for blood.
check the babysitter's hands.
see if she handled the weapon.
you, um...
you sure you're ready?
if we don't do this now, we risk losing the evidence.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Hey.
it's nice seeing Eric back at work.
I know.
it's pretty amazing. It's only been a few weeks since he was shot.
looks like there's a little bit of grass in the wound and some kind of...
insect.
isn't it a little early for infestation?
you know, insects are attracted to hydrocarbons released postmortem.
it's a pretty immediate reaction.
Yeah, but I would think we'd only see maggot larvae or blowflies on a body that's been dead more than 12 hours.
maybe Mr. Crowley was attacked a lot earlier than his wife.
could have laid there for several hours, and then have gone to the front door for help.
think it changes our timeline?
I don't know.
maybe this little guy's going to tell us.
Hey.
so the babysitter said she saw someone at this window, right?
possible peeping tom.
maybe tom was doing more than peeping.
how can you tell?
there's fresh tool marks.
he tried to pry the window open.
maybe whoever it was left behind something more than tool marks.
Yes, it's a glass window.
good surface for prints.
maybe we'll get lucky.
Yeah.
my fingerprints on the Montavo window?
how do you know they're mine?
we have your fingerprints from an old dui charge.
I was in med school.
Yes, and I must tell you that you're a person of interest, Mr. Lasker.
doctor.
Dr. Lasker.
doctor.
what were you doing looking through the window?
Dave montavo borrowed some tools from me.
last night, I stopped by to see if they were home.
and what did you see?
the babysitter.
Oh, she was...
she was doing a lot more than babysitting.
believe me.
well, I guess we'll see if that checks out.
come on, really?
you're honestly looking at me for this?
I honestly am.
look, I know the last 12 hours have been really difficult on you.
but you've got to tell me the truth, okay?
I was alone.
I swear.
Heather, we have an eyewitness that tells us something different.
the man in the window?
Yeah.
he, uh...
he claims that you were in a state of, uh...
undress.
do you want to tell me what you were doing?
I know I wasn't supposed to, but I was trying on Mrs. Montavo's clothes.
she shops at all the high-end stores.
I'm sorry.
excuse me one second.
Hey.
How're you doing?
good. What's up?
patrol radioed in. They just picked up Dave and Renee montavo.
okay, thanks.
is Justin okay?
he's in good hands. He's with child services.
can we take him home?
right after you tell me what you did last night.
actually, um...
we passed out in our car.
she drank too much.
I drank?
excuse me?
you couldn't even stand up straight.
Oh, no, I was the designated driver.
all I had was orange juice.
orange juice and god knows what else he had.
please answer the question.
truth is, lieutenant, we don't know what happened.
we went to a party at our neighbor's house, Oliver Brenner.
afterwards, we just blacked out.
let me get this straight.
a double murder occurs in your home, and you're claiming you were blacked out in your car.
I realize how this looks.
I'm not sure that you do.
I'm going to need the address to that party.
I need these tables in the truck now.
we have a wedding in Biscayne tonight.
I'm with miami-dade csi.
I'm here about a murder investigation.
Oh, um, I don't know what goes on at the parties,
I just plan them.
do you know anything about the glasses that were used at last night's event?
I know that I need to have them washed and in Biscayne by 4: 00.
so they haven't been cleaned?
no, we do that at base.
not today.
they're evidence in a murder investigation.
I'm going to be taking them all with me.
I'm going to need the backup stemware.
I'm also going to need a list of everyone that was at that party last night.
I will give you whatever you need.
just keep my company's name out of it.
Yeah, I'll try my best.
so what did we get on the Montavos?
well, I printed everything from the Brenner party, and I did find the Montavos' drinking glasses.
but both their blood-alcohol tests came back negative, so they didn't have much to drink.
okay. But that doesn't mean they weren't dosed, does it?
two for two.
positive for ghb.
makes sense.
GHB hits the brain fast, the body metabolizes it as oxygen and carbon dioxide.
leaves no trace behind.
that mixed even with a little bit of alcohol, would knock them out completely.
so the Montavos are telling the truth.
see, if you ask me, someone did not want them to come home last night.
Oh, my gosh. You took the entire window.
Oh, yeah.
you know, I was figuring that the only reason why you would drug the Montavo family is to rob them.
maybe the Crowleys interrupted a burglary.
did you find anything?
Yeah, hit the uv.
take a look, uh, right here.
what is that?
I don't know, so I'm running it through the ftir now.
you know what, this stuff is on the inside of the window.
someone wanted out, not in.
well, it's, uh, benzoyl peroxide and sodium carbomer.
is that some kind of antiaging-antiwrinkle type cream?
think younger -- benzoyl peroxide is for acne.
you mean the kid.
maybe he was trying to sneak out of the house.
Yeah, gives him the perfect window of opportunity.
he wasn't at the party, so he couldn't have spiked the drinks.
Hey.
I just got the guest list from the party planner.
anybody we'd be interested in?
Dr. Mike Lasker.
looks like it's time to make another appointment with the doctor.
Dr. Lasker, you lied to me.
lied about what?
witnesses can put you at the Brenner party, and that's a lie by omission.
Dave Montavo is a thief.
the guy stole from me.
do you have anything to back that up?
after every party, things go missing from the host's house.
not two weeks ago, I had a party.
last weekend, my house was hit.
how did you know it was Montavo?
he's always nosing around your stuff wanting to know how valuable it is.
kept asking me about my '69 world series ball.
last weekend, it was gone.
so you went to the party and dosed their drinks?
I didn't want this to get out of hand.
Yes, well, it's far too late for that.
okay...
truth?
I slipped a safe amount of ghb into their drinks.
I just needed time to search their place.
or to commit a double murder.
no, I needed to be certain before I pointed the finger.
Yes, well, that finger is now pointing at you.
the Crowleys are dead and you show up with a warrant to search my house?
what is this for?
the warrant's for stolen property.
could be motive for a double murder.
wait, what?
that's ridiculous.
when was the last time you were at Dr. Lasker's residence?
it was a few weeks ago.
Mike had a party. Half the neighborhood was there.
you people seem to like to party around here.
lieutenant, we don't understand.
what does this have to do with the Crowleys?
there have been allegations of a theft.
we haven't stolen anything.
Hey, did you get something?
Yeah!
Hey, you can't just...
tear up my house.
signed baseball.
it's, uh...
miracle mets.
just like lasker said.
I swear neither of us knew that that was there.
there's also a rolex professional in here which was reported missing last night by one of your neighbors.
last night?
when we were both unconscious.
you see?
we had nothing to do with this.
Mr. Montavo, where's your son?
you've been sneaking out of the house, Justin.
no way.
I didn't go anywhere.
evidence that we recovered from the window says you have.
okay, so maybe I snuck out a few times.
we found your stash in the heating duct, which means you've been stealing from your neighbors.
I need your help.
I wasn't the only one doing something bad.
how do you mean, son?
my babysitter, heather, she had a guy over.
what guy?
her boyfriend.
doesn't that help?
you know what, justin?
I think it might.
I was alone.
I swear.
don't add to your tragedy by trying to protect someone else.
believe me, it's not worth it.
now, we know someone was there with you.
okay.
so I had someone over.
but no one was supposed to know.
and why was that?
cause of my parents.
they don't like him.
they didn't want us together.
listen to me, Heather.
I'm going to need the name of your boyfriend.
give me the phone.
come on. Give it to me.
you can take her.
thank you.
is this Zach Griffith?
who is this?
Zach, my name is Ryan Wolfe.
I'm with miami-dade police department.
I want you to come down here and talk to us.
why would I do that?
because, Zach, I'm investigating a double homicide.
now do you want to come down...
Zach Griffith spotted on eighth and collins.
suspect is fleeing.
pursuit in progress.
don't move!
stay exactly where you are.
Zach Griffith, you're under arrest.
for what?
felony fleeing and eluding.
but if I had to put my money down,
I would add a charge of murder.
we just wanted to bring you in as a witness, and you ran.
well, I-I freaked, you know?
I'm sorry.
I know you and Heather were having sex.
so?
is that why you killed the Crowleys, because they caught you together?
okay, here...
here's what happened.
I was with heather last night.
she was babysitting.
I tried to sneak out the back, and-and her dad jumped me.
look, I know you're sleeping with her.
stay away from her.
Hey, if you can't control her, it's not my problem.
you know what I can't figure out is how you mustered up all the force to kill him.
you keep saying kill him.
I didn't kill anybody.
her dad got in my face, and so, I pumped it out of there.
Zach, if you're lying to me, I'll find out.
it's what I do.
is there anything you want to tell me?
no.
next time I won't be so understanding.
did you find something?
maybe.
I just took a closer look at the insects in Mr. Crowley's wound, and there are no blowflies.
there are only houseflies.
houseflies aren't from decomp.
exactly.
but I'm thinking they might still give us a timeline.
how's that?
well, houseflies are dormant at night.
so maybe Mr. Crowley was attacked earlier than we thought?
Yeah, but that's not all.
come take a look at this micro view.
wings, legs, but no thorax.
which means they were hit by something with a lot of force.
or someone.
well, the average punch is under 20 miles an hour, so to make an insect look like this, they'd have to be hit by a force of at least 40.
so if it was someone, we're looking for a very strong man.
I was drugged at a party last night. I...
there's no way I could have killed them.
you were a boxer in college.
I bet you can still pack a punch.
I-I was.
that was years ago.
boa Vista: Well, as it turns out, we think that mr. Crowley may have been murdered before we previously thought.
I was at work all day.
what about you and Mrs. Crowley, your neighbor?
what about her?
just how neighborly were you?
what are you talking about?
were you having an affair with her?
I didn't kill anyone.
and I'm not cheating on my wife.
we'd like you to prove it.
how?
we'd like to take your dna.
do you have a problem with that?
do what you got to do.
open up.
Hey.
you having any luck identifying all these stolen items?
well, besides the baseball, everything was reported stolen from the neighborhood.
except this.
let's see.
wow, that's a beauty.
someone's definitely missing it.
I can tell you who.
yeah? What you got?
bracelet popped up on a theft report, but not from around the neighborhood.
call came out of golden beach.
there's the case number.
golden beach? That's miles from coconut grove.
Yeah.
it doesn't fit the pattern of a 12-year-old kleptomaniac.
why would the Montavos have it?
that's a good question.
Horatio's going to ask the daughter.
why the daughter?
the original owner, Lucille Clarke, died last month.
her daughter, Amelia, is on her way in.
miss Clarke?
I'm lieutenant Caine.
thank you for calling.
mother's bracelet means the world to me.
is that her bracelet?
dad gave it to her when they were first married.
had no business spending that kind of money, he used to say.
but he just...
had to.
can I keep it?
as soon as I clear this up, you can keep it, okay?
I need to know how she lost it.
my mom never took it off.
ever.
even when she got sick.
cancer.
we thought that she was going to make it, that...
the last time that she went to saint matthews
that's when it was stolen.
do you recall the doctor's name?
Dr. Mike Lasker.
do you know him?
as a matter of fact, I do.
lieutenant Caine, I'm in the middle of rounds, so I only have a minute.
did you find my baseball?
as a matter of fact, we did.
along the way, we stumbled onto this.
do you recognize that bracelet?
Yes, it belonged to, uh, Lucille Clarke.
she was a patient of mine.
she wanted me to have it.
interesting.
not according to her daughter.
well, maybe Mrs. Clarke didn't have time to tell her.
she died a month ago.
I'm happy to return it to the family.
that won't be necessary.
Dr. Lasker, have you ever received a gift from another patient?
lieutenant Caine...
I've done nothing wrong.
investigate me all you want.
I looked into the good doctor like you asked.
and what did you get, Frank?
Dr. Mike lasker -- it's his third job in as many years.
he's made appearances before the Georgia and Louisiana state medical boards.
and let me guess.
where other patients died under his care.
try six.
one family cried malpractice, but the autopsy confirmed death by respiratory failure.
doesn't mean it was natural, does it?
I'm thinking serial killer.
the good doctor goes in, kills them, takes his trophies before the families can claim the bodies.
Mrs. Clarke was his most recent victim, wasn't she?
Yeah.
he went to the Montavo house to steal back the only thing that could tie him to the crime.
Yes, but we beat him to it.
you, uh...
wanted me to bring my kit.
why, what's up?
well, the babysitter was lying, and I'm just trying to figure out if she's covering for Mr. Montavo.
by going over my evidence reports?
I'm just making sure that we crossed all our ts.
I swabbed the babysitter for blood, and she's clean.
so, if there's a confidence issue, Calleigh, why don't you just say so?
you're recovering from a brain injury.
I don't think it hurts anybody to be absolutely certain.
I know I've been a little slow lately.
I've had to relearn the basics.
for a lot of things.
but I do them all step-by-step, and I get them right.
I'm looking at these reports, and your phenolphthalein test is out of order.
well, that can't be.
I need to see your kit.
do you normally keep these reagents in order of application?
Yeah, of course.
then I think we have a problem.
the peroxide and the water are switched, which creates a false negative.
no.
that can't be.
you've got, um...
h2o...
h2o2.
it's a really easy mistake.
it's a big one.
I wouldn't have done that.
you did.
we may have lost our shot at the killer.
we need to figure out how to get this guy.
what are you doing?
going over all of the evidence I handled today.
I feel horrible.
I really messed up.
you're still recovering, Eric.
I messed up today, and i don't even have an excuse.
what did you do?
I was so busy looking at insect evidence, that I completely missed the bigger picture.
what do you mean?
the fly that we found in Mr. Crowley's wound was hit at a high velocity.
but his head doesn't show significant impact.
how was the man going at one speed, and the fly at another?
I think the killer used a weapon that had a dead fly on it.
and then it was transferred.
well, it doesn't make sense.
I know my math was right, so whatever hit that fly was going at least 40 miles an hour.
like a car windshield.
or a motorcycle helmet.
are you ready?
I'm not going in.
come on. It'll be good for your confidence.
no, you were right. I made a rookie mistake.
Hey, you were the one who figured out the murder weapon.
you were the one who broke the case.
I came back too soon.
all right.
I'll go this one alone.
but we can't make it without you.
what do you want now?
Really?
how about this.
I told you I'd figure it out and I did.
I know how you killed Edward Crowley.
what do you mean?
we found traces of his dna on your motorcycle helmet.
okay. So I hit him.
it wasn't my fault, though, he attacked me.
look, I know you're sleeping with her.
stay away from her.
if you can't control her, it's not my problem.
if it was self-defense, how come you killed Heather's mom?
I didn'T.
you lied to me about one murder.
don't lie to me again.
aren't I supposed to, like, get a lawyer or something?
if that's your request.
it is.
Hey.
Hey.
just finished the post on Kimberly Crowley.
got some physical findings.
you ran a sexual assault kit?
Yeah, found some minor tearing.
indication of recent sexual intercourse.
okay. I'll, um...
run it against the husband.
and all the parties on that block, honey,
I'd run it against the entire neighborhood.
well, whatever it takes.
Hey, did you call?
Yeah.
I found a very interesting dna match from the sexual examination on the babysitter's mom.
the neighborhood just got kinkier.
Yeah.
we know that your boyfriend killed your dad.
why don't you, uh...
why don't you tell us the rest?
no, I can't do that to him.
him?
I was talking about you.
what?
I didn't have any blood on me.
your officer cleared me this morning.
well, that's because you washed your hands after you stabbed your mom.
what do you mean?
lift up your shirt.
go ahead, lift up your shirt.
you could never understand.
this has to do with Zach, doesn't it?
we recovered evidence that he and your mother had sex last night.
I couldn't believe my mom would do that with my boyfriend.
when did you find out?
last night.
I thought my dad and Zach were fighting about me.
look, I know you're sleeping with her.
stay away from her.
Hey, if you can't control her, it's not my problem.
Oh, he found the card you gave me.
I tried to stop him.
baby, are you okay?
Kim, not now.
no, it's okay.
now we can be together.
we don't have to worry.
mom?
are you and Zach...
honey...
I didn't want you to find out this way.
I'm sorry.
sorry?
stay away from him!
Oh, my god.
you didn't see me, and I didn't see you.
status on Mrs. Clarke, please.
our exhumed body?
Lucille Clarke was positive for pancuronium.
which mimics respiratory failure.
the doctor was smart.
or so he would think.
sir, I think we've got something over here.
three states, seven victims.
you've got quite a body of work, Dr. Lasker.
every doctor loses patients.
these patients lost their lives to a serial killer -- you.
please.
you don't believe that.
was killed by this drug.
I took the oath to help people, save them from suffering.
you ended their lives.
they were all terminally ill, on life support.
you stole from them and then murdered them, Dr. Lasker.
I gave them their dignity.
their families were merely postponing the inevitable.
Dr. Lasker, the inevitable has arrived.
cut!
good? -Uh, yeah, I'm good.
I'm good. Thanks.
that was hot! Yeah! -Rod! Rod!
what happened? What the hell?
shot's ruined.
who popped the trunk? -Wasn't me.
must've been open before we rolled. Talk to transpo.
Hey, come quick! -What is it?
you got to see this.
what's going on?
Oh, my god.
it's Brody.
somebody call an ambulance!
I'm live on the scene where actor Brody Lassiter was found dead of his latest movie Full Tilt.
the body of movie star Brody Lassiter was discovered while filming a dangerous high-speed car chase this morning...
no information has been released yet on how lassiter died or even if he was part of the stunt.
no, he wasn't part of the stunt. It's too dangerous.
apparently so.
how'd he end up in there?
people don't just put themselves in trunks. -I have no idea.
why don't you guys do whatever cops do and find out.
cause your stunt crew destroyed my crime scene.
if you're saying we tried to cover something up, extinguishers are protocol.
you were in charge of the car, weren't you?
Yeah, checked everything last night after the dry run.
locked it up before I left. -Apparently not well enough.
look...I'm sorry.
I've just been doing this so long.
it's always been fake.
I keep thinking Brody's gonna be okay.
well, he's not going to walk away from this one.
and neither...will his killer.
this is Melissa Black reporting live...
and today he's dead
body of Brody Lassiter...2006 the highest-grossing actor in hollywood...
all right, careful. Careful, let's do this right.
going to be plenty of eyes watching this one.
was Mr. Lassiter working this morning?
well, that's what's so weird.
his call time wasn't till noon.
how about last night? -No.
no, brody wraps at 6: 00 sharp.
every 15 minutes we go over, costs us 20 grand.
his contract had a lot of rules. -Rules.
his wardrobe had to be organic cotton.
fresh pomegranate juice every morning, no pulp.
let's just say, a lot of people wanted him off the movie.
hold up, hold up, hold up. Where you going with that?
is that for Brody? -Excuse me.
can I help you?
Yeah, I'm Eddie Corbett. I'm in charge of Brody.
gentlemen, continue, please.
thank you, ma'am.
Mr. Corbett, what can I do for you?
his family's on their way down from Pennsylvania and they want a funeral.
and they're going to get a funeral.
not for a few days. I know how these things work.
then you understand that we do have jurisdiction over the body.
you're gonna cut him up now, right?
what am I going to tell his family? They want an open casket.
I'm sure his family wants me to find out who did this, don't they?
this is my fault.
I should've been watching him.
what did you do for Brody?
babysit.
Brody's been known to party.
this movie's huge for the studio. They already greenlit two sequels.
they paid me to get him to work in one piece.
guess I failed.
how long did you know him?
grew up together.
I'm sorry for your loss.
look...
it's no secret that Brody could be difficult sometimes.
but he didn't deserve to die like this.
Mr. Corbett, no one does.
Brody Lassiter, I don't believe it. -You're a fan?
I only saw Blitzed three times.
it's that whole bad boy thing. I guess I like it.
any idea what killed him?
well, won't know much until I get this flame-retardant powder off him.
honey, what is in that trunk? Because baby boy is glowing.
what does it look like?
antifreeze is this color, but no one's gonna use that in Miami, and it definitely doesn't glow.
wait a minute.
I got it. It's a broken glow stick.
it's got to be fresh if it's still working.
maybe they used it in the stunt. -I don't think so.
says it's from a nightclub.
there are no tool marks on the trunk and the lock hasn't been tampered with.
so no one broke in. And the stunt guy had the only key.
stunt guy is lying.
someone must've stolen it last night after wrap.
the steering column was intact and you're the only one with the key.
so, why don't you try again.
okay.
I took the car out.
me and Brody went clubbing in it.
so, what happened? You and Brody have drink too much, get in a fight?
no, no way.
Brody was stone-cold sober.
that's the good part about going out with a guy in rehab.
Brody Lassiter was in rehab? -Yeah, inpatient with work privileges. Where've you been?
so, Brody snuck out last night. -Yeah.
sweet for me
a designated driver who's a movie star.
I could get hammered and get into every club in the city.
why don't you get to the part where brody ends up in the trunk.
believe me, I have no idea.
he was fine when I dropped him off at white sands.
white sands, that's the, uh, that's the rehab center for the rich and famous?
after he went inside, I was too wasted to drive, so, I thought I'd sleep it off a little bit in the parking lot.
damn, dude, the way you drive, you should be doing your own stunts.
Nah, too many pads and helmets. This is more fun.
Oh, man. I think I'm going to hurl.
see you later, Rod.
when I woke up, it was an hour to call time.
so I left.
why didn't you say anything before?
I took a production car.
it wasn't even insured.
I could lose my stunt accreditation.
Oh, I think you can lose a lot more than that.
look, I told you, I had nothing to do with brody dying.
we're going to hold you for a little while just to make sure of that.
I don't trust you actors. -I'm a stunt guy.
whatever.
Hi.
Brody didn't die in the car, Ryan.
what do you mean?
he has a ligature mark on his neck.
the mark's at an angle, above the laryngeal prominence.
and that's consistent with a hanging.
it was suicide. -No.
look at the laceration on his neck.
he tried to pull the rope off. -That's right.
and you don't typically find marks like these in a true suicide.
only do that if you don't want to die.
okay, so explain to me how you hang a 170-pound guy against his will?
didn't someone hear him screaming? -It's rehab.
everyone's screaming.
you ever seen someone go through detox?
see, that reminds me, I gotta get over there, but thank you, Alexx.
I knew you could do it. Do what, honey?
get me probable cause for a warrant.
you are wasting your time, gentlemen.
white sands...saved Brody's life.
he couldn't have been killed here.
trust me. This is a safe place.
well, we looked into the history of this place. It's, um...
it's not that safe. -What do you mean by that?
two people died here, Mr. Ashford.
those were suicides.
we've made changes since then.
define changes, please.
when a patient checks in, we confiscate anything that could be used as a weapon.
please remove your shoes, Mr. Lassiter.
I'm also going to need your belt, your cell phone.
do you have any sharp objects on your person? -No.
I don't know if I can do this, man.
I know it doesn't seem like it right now...
it gets easier.
now, you have any problems, you come to me personally... okay?
Thanks.
and look around.
glasses are plastic, not even a butter knife.
I think we're gonna look a little harder than that.
what's this?
that is a search warrant. -Oh, no.
you're not gonna turn this place into a circus.
these people pay a lot of money to protect their confidentiality.
relax. We're only looking into Brody Lassiter's room.
fine.
you won't find anything. -I guess time will tell.
Yeah, got it. -The noose?
no, where the rope was hung. There's A...
there's a groove in the wood.
so this is definitely where brody died. So much for being the, uh...
safest place in miami, you know?
Yeah, well, Ashford was right about one thing.
there's nothing in this room that can be used like a noose.
I found something. -Yeah? What's that?
it's a hair. Black, but it's too long to be Brody's.
bet you it's female. -Well, yeah.
he's a big star. Probably had his pick of any of the girls in here.
Hey, Natalia. -Yeah?
the walls of the bathroom aren't painted green, are they? -No.
cause there's a mark on this shelf that's green. And it looks like...
looks like somebody had wet paint on their fingers.
there are green pots outside. Did you see those?
Yeah, the ones lining the walkway.
somebody had to have painted them.
Yeah, I painted the pots.
anything I can do to stay away from all those celebutantes.
so it sounds like it's a common practice for the patients to tend the grounds.
it's part of their treatment plan.
doing manual labor's supposed to get you in touch with your inner self, or some zen bs like that.
you're up at white sands under court order.
this pansy judge spun a tale that I'm a violent drunk.
but I'm not like those brats.
I don't belong there. -I would agree.
I think you belong in jail.
what were you doing in Brody Lassiter's room?
so this third degree is about Mr. Hollywood?
I thought you guys found his body on some movie set.
we also found your paint in his room.
these kids get any drug they want smuggled in there.
rumor was he was hiding vodka in his water bottle.
so a couple days ago, I went looking.
look, lieutenant, you can't pin this on me.
I know this game.
I've been in the hot seat before.
then get comfortable.
so I heard that Natalia didn't get a hit with codis on the black hair we found in brody's room.
that is true, but that might be of some help.
turns out, it's not really black.
it's dyed. That's pretty great.
it's a lead. -Well, in theory.
right. White sands isn't gonna give us a list of their patients with dyed hair.
medical confidentiality even covers murder.
it's a good thing it doesn't cover gossip. Come with me.
it's a guilty pleasure.
have not read it yet, but Holly Reese is on the cover.
she just went into rehab.
is that right? I thought she was the one celebrity with a good reputation.
I know. So much for the bubble gum image, right?
and her blonde hair--look at that.
Yeah, used to be blonde. Exactly.
Wow. -All right.
looks like Brody's helping her through her addiction.
white sands is known for its privacy, but that photo was taken inside Brody's room, wasn't it?
well, how'd the paparazzi get in there? -I don't know.
why don't you go there, and I'm gonna go talk to holly.
that sounds good.
sorry for dragging you out here. It's just... never know who's taking notes inside.
paparazzi's everywhere.
Yeah, I read the article in telltale.
so I just want to ask you a few questions.
does this mean I'm a suspect?
or just one of those persons of interest?
well, it really just depends on how you explain what you were doing in Brody's room.
we have evidence that puts you there.
am I in trouble?
Oh, my god, you're gonna arrest me.
okay, quick, just do it before someone sees me.
no, uh, Miss Reese, you can turn around.
I'm just here to ask you a few questions.
I just want to know what you were doing in Brody's room.
it's hard to have fun in this place without your cell phone, you know?
so, um, we have sex.
beats therapy. -Oh, I feel cured.
how about you?
wasn't serious.
okay, did you see him last night? -No.
I was "hallway monitor" last night.
sucked. -Really?
did you see something, someone, anything unusual?
well, no. I, uh...
truth is, I passed out.
from what? This is rehab.
uh, yeah. Side effect, from being an addict.
sometimes I get blackouts.
when you need an alibi? -No.
no, I cared about Brody.
I mean, we started out just hooking up, but then,
I don't know, he got me.
he understood the whole "I want to be normal, but I'm famous" thing.
I'd never kill him.
I think it's a good thing that you can't leave.
I know. This place is like prison.
trust me, it's nothing like prison.
well, we got to figure out where the photographer was if we're gonna figure out who he is, 'cause maybe he snapped some pictures the night of the murder.
well, from the angle of the shot, they had to have taken it through this window.
Yeah, paparazzi with a telephoto lens.
maybe they took it from one of those rooms.
something's weird.
from that distance, they'd never get that vantage point. The angle is...
it's too steep. -Yeah they would've had to be closer to the room.
or in it.
unbelievable.
boy, I can't even imagine the things this camera's seen.
that's the camera from Brody's room? -Yeah.
unfortunately, it's only pointed at the bed.
since the murder happened in the main room, we don't get to see the killing.
but there is one interesting thing.
the bedspread. -Exactly.
it was never in any crime scene photos. -Okay, continue, please.
wait a minute.
there's somebody there.
but his face is never on screen.
wait a minute. Right there.
the ring. -Yes, in its reflection.
let me resolve that image.
is that the head of the clinic? -Not for long.
taking out the trash?
bag on the table and step away from it.
clients aren't the only ones who do chores around here.
we like to set a good example.
you can't touch that. Your warrant only covers brody's room.
the warrant has been amended.
gave up your rights once you compromised your patients, Mr. Ashford.
put cameras in those rooms, you took pictures, and you sold them to the tabloids.
so much for privacy.
look, you've got to understand.
white sands does not advertise.
good publicity is how we keep these rooms full.
a little invasion of privacy...and they love the exposure.
looks like we found our noose.
Mr. Ashford, you adjusted that camera angle to cover the murder, didn't you?
no.
I didn't kill Brody.
I found him hanging there this morning.
I moved the camera so it didn't catch me moving his body.
lieutenant, suicides are bad for my business. -So is murder.
so if you didn't string him up, who did?
I don't know.
but there are plenty of people who had cause.
Why?
yesterday, Brody reached level 6.
confessions.
basically, you make good with your past.
apologize to everyone you've wronged.
our suspect pool just got bigger.
so that means I'm off the hook. -No, not exactly.
you're an accessory to murder.
get ready for level 6.
so who did Brody confess to?
all the patients at white sands, they have to share three landlines, and Brody had access to one of those phones last night from 7: 00 to 9: 00.
I traced all the calls he made.
almost everyone he confessed to lives out of state.
the locals check out, too, so it's a dead end.
maybe the confession wasn't over.
how we gonna know who he was going to call?
we go back to the clinic.
the administration will just keep stonewalling us.
talk to the patients.
my parents never told-- -At least you still have a mom.
Hey, hey, hey!
no cross-talking.
you can finish that thought tomorrow.
okay, that's it for today, everyone. Let's go.
Hey, guys, listen, uh, before you all take off, I'm Eric Delko, MDPD.
I'm just looking for a little help with a few questions about Brody Lassiter.
let's go.
just information, guys.
no one's in any kind of trouble.
I was wondering when someone was going to ask about Brody, but I don't think we're legally allowed to talk.
well, what's your name? -Jolene.
it's okay.
it's just the employees here who are bound by confidentiality.
well, I really shouldn't say anything anyway.
Brody was hanged last night.
any help I can get in solving this murder, I appreciate it.
okay, but we only talked, like, four or five times.
all right. Well, what do you think you know?
well, this one time we were partnered up.
sort of role-playing before we hit level 6.
the confessions? -Yeah.
and he confessed something.
Oh, this is really hard for me.
just say it, Brody.
let it out.
I killed someone. -What?!
you killed someone?
I'm not sure if it was real, but he did say that.
thank you, Jolene.
you know, you're really brave.
Why? For telling you? -No.
for being here.
Tripp, look, I've got a girl here who says that -Lassiter confessed to killing somebody. -Any idea who?
she doesn't know that part.
so, look, we've got to go through Brody's entire history for unexplained deaths, anything.
I think I know where to start.
Eddie, you told me that you and Brody grew up together.
that's right. Raised on the same block.
maybe shared some of the same instincts.
what's that supposed to mean? -Look, Eddie -we know Brody killed someone. -What?!
you're his best friend. You knew that.
maybe you helped him clean it up.
no way. -Found out you used to have a job in waste management.
that was high school, man.
all right, let's try something a little more recent.
Angie Paulson was doing a comedy with Brody when she disappeared.
never showed up on the set, never heard from again.
that girl was crazy.
she went all buddhist. Moved to tibet or something.
according to her family, she's still a missing person.
and if you helped brody dispose of angie's body, that ties you in.
look, man, I didn't do anything.
everybody's done something, Eddie.
that's the noose Delko found in the clinic director's trash?
Yeah. Guess what I found on it?
what? -Mass spec says that it's heroin.
the tabloid said Holly Reese was admitted for heroin.
she could have relapsed. She did say she blacked out.
Yeah, but the clinic's never going to let us look at her records.
that's true, but we have her hair.
looks like holly hasn't done any heroin recently.
you know what? In fact, she's never done any at all.
what do you mean? -Her hair is crystal-clean.
there's no heroin. There's no drugs. There's nothing.
so she lied about being an addict.
I don't know. Everybody wants out of rehab. Why does she want in?
see what star was arrested at rehab today.
Hey, Holly. It's Calleigh Duquesne.
Hey. Have a seat. -Thank you.
front page of the tabloids and breaking news all in one week.
and that's good? -Oh, all publicity is good publicity.
well, how about this headline? "Holly reese fakes addiction."
what are you talking about?
I mean, I'm here to kick heroin.
Holly, hair records drugs like a timeline.
your hair is completely clean.
look, um,
I'm just here researching for a role.
it's a huge part. I get to un-glam, and that's how all the stars get oscars.
halle, Nicole, Charlize.
how did you get past the physical screenings?
Mr. Ashford knows my situation.
he helped me get admitted.
Holly, you do realize that he is the person who sold the pictures of you and Brody to the tabloids, don't you?
Hey, he got press, I got press. Everyone's happy.
I don't know that everyone's happy.
Brody Lassiter's representatives released a statement to the media a couple of days ago saying that the two of you were never together.
that must have hurt.
well, yeah. -And so what?
you went into brody's room last night, got all of your anger out?
no, I didn't.
I was on hall duty, like I told you.
but you also said that you blacked out, and clearly, that's a lie.
I just didn't want to say what I saw.
well, I'm afraid now you have no choice.
fine. It was Jerry, that criminal guy.
he went into Brody's room last night.
Jerry went into brody's room a lot of nights.
are you trying to tell me that Brody Lassiter was gay?
look, I don't know for sure, all right?
I mean, he liked girls, too.
I think.
do you remember about what time Jerry went into his room?
no. I wasn't looking at my watch.
God, you're not going to tell anyone, are you?
I mean, I finally get a picture in the tabs with an a-lister, and then it turns out that he likes guys.
that news doesn't exactly make me bankable.
well, I guess all publicity is not good publicity.
you said you were in Brody's room a few days ago, but we have an eyewitness that puts you there last night.
you and Brody were in a relationship, weren't you?
he's dead, so you can stop protecting his reputation.
we found a lot of his personal items in your room.
you two think I'm a fruit.
what were you doing with his stuff? -Selling it.
didn't you see how much Justin's half-eaten piece of pizza went for on e-bay?
I saw an opportunity to make a little extra cash.
so, he found you stealing his stuff, and you decided to kill him?
no.
he wasn't even there.
I had nothing to do with his murder.
we found heroin on the murder weapon. -Good for you.
did you pick up a new habit in rehab? -No.
then you won't mind proving that, will you?
Hey. Jerry tested negative for heroin.
I don't think he's our killer.
Yeah, I don't think so, either. -Why not?
because the noose that was used to hang brody was made of dental floss.
dental floss? -Yeah.
how-how is that possible?
has a tensile strength of up to 25 pounds per strand.
you braid it together, it makes it even stronger.
it's even been used to break out of jail.
okay, but how does that rule Jerry out?
well, based on the number of strands and the length of the rope, took someone a long time to make it, and jerry's only been in rehab two weeks.
so, who's been at white sands the longest?
you've been a patient here at white sands for almost two months, which means that you would have had ample time to make this.
it was used to hang Brody Lassiter. -What?
it disappeared from my room last night.
what were you going to use the rope for, Jolene?
nothing, really.
come on.
you know I'm allowed to leave white sands anytime I want.
I just don't have the guts to do it.
you were going to kill yourself?
I feel like I...
I might not make it at home.
but you've come so far.
two months sober.
but in rehab, there's always someone to talk to.
there's people watching me.
what am I going to have in Kansas city?
my journals?
rehab exercises?
that's not going to go very far.
but what about your family?
they spent all their money sending me here.
what if it doesn't work?
I'm going to let them down again. -No, you're not going to let them down.
they want to help you.
how do you know?
a couple of months ago, I got shot.
and I was scared to come back to work.
you were? -Yeah.
I didn't want to ask for anybody's help.
I ended up making...a few mistakes.
but every day it gets a little better.
and it'll get better for you, too.
your friends and family, they just want to be there for you.
you're gonna be okay, Jolene.
I guess I'll have to be.
somebody stole my other option.
Hey. -Hey.
so, uh...so, what's all this?
they're Brody's journals. We confiscated them from Jerry.
luckily, you got to them before he put 'em on e-bay.
what is this? This looks like his obituary.
it is.
that's not supposed to come out till tomorrow.
I know. This one was written a week ago.
by who? -Well, brody wrote it himself.
it's a rehab exercise.
it's supposed to make you write down everything you've done in your life and the changes you want to make.
does it say that he killed someone in this?
no, but he does make reference to an "accident." -Really?
after the accident, Brody Lassiter got into drugs, and decided to move to Miami to be an actor.
I think he may have moved to evade charges?
well, we, uh, looked into his history.
he doesn't have any warrants or, uh, wants for him.
Yeah, but an accident's not a crime.
so, how do you find out if something happened to a dead guy?
go to the source.
so, Calleigh, I figured out why no one heard him screaming.
subdural hematoma. He hit his head.
well, that would explain why he didn't fight back.
what about any older injury? Anything like that?
not on the body, but inside.
see that? Right there. -Ribcage?
these are multiple healed fractures.
when we break bones, they actually grow back thicker and stronger than before, so they show up brighter on the x-ray.
these are compression fractures. -Meaning?
he was hit with something straight on.
this'll show us what.
whatever it was, it was round.
it was a car accident.
well, if there was a a fatality, it would have been in the news.
so, what exactly are we looking for?
we're looking for fatal car crashes that occurred before Brody moved from Pennsylvania to Miami.
these are all the clips from local Williamsport Newspapers.
here's one: "Tragic accident."
but the driver was apprehended at scene and arrested.
Yeah. Moving on. -Okay.
Oh, here's one.
Nah, that car was sideswiped.
that wouldn't cause steering wheel impact.
okay. Moving on.
here we go.
local girl killed in grisly crash.
ran the car into a telephone pole, and the driver was killed.
Yeah, Brody's x-rays are showing that he was the driver.
okay. Moving on.
wait a minute. Wait a minute. Go back a second.
back... okay.
look at the name of the victim. -Diane Corbett.
that's right.
that's the same last name as Brody's assistant, Eddie Corbett.
then maybe Brody was there.
maybe he just moved Diane's body into the driver's seat after the car accident and took off.
I think we just found our crash.
we found heroin in your apartment, Eddie.
personal use.
to take the edge off. What are you gonna do, arrest me for it?
no, I'm going to arrest you for murder.
what? -We found heroin residue on brody's noose.
I'm guessing it's a match to yours.
Brody made a big deal about me moving out here.
said he didn't know who to trust.
needed his best friend around.
it was all guilt. -Guilty about Diane. Right?
Yeah.
she was my big sister. -And she died in that car accident, didn't she?
I didn't even know Brody was in the car.
I mean, he's supposed to be my best boy and he doesn't even tell me that he was the one driving?
trying to tell you, eddie.
last night, he...
he called me from the club. He told me to meet him at white sands.
I-I thought he relapsed or something.
because he wanted to confess to you.
like it was okay now because he said it out loud.
I'm so sorry, bro. I wanted to tell you, but...
then why didn't you?
I was scared. -You killed my sister.
you killed her!
he wasn't breathing.
I didn't mean for that to happen.
so you decided to make it look like suicide.
that was the idea.
and I searched in a bunch of rooms, you know, for anything that could've made it seem like brody could've done it himself.
then I found that rope.
Brody was still alive.
Yeah. I freaked. I ran.
just like he did ten years ago. -No, no, no, no, it was different.
Yes, it was different, Eddie.
the difference is you got caught.
the paparazzi is loving this.
best friends both turn out to be killers.
this brings the Brody Lassiter murder investigation to a close.
best friend and longtime assistant Eddie Corbett has just been arrested.
and in other celebrity news, Holly Reese's latest project has been greenlit.
it will focus on one brave young woman's struggle with addiction.
and speaking of addiction, pop singer Elvina has reportedly checked herself into rehab.
I guess it's true, everybody has a secret.
some of us more than one.
Brett, what is that?
Brett, wake up. What is that?
wait here. I'll check it out.
Brett! Brett, get up!
Brett! Get up!
come on.
help! Help!
help! Somebody help us!
Horatio. Fire rescue's getting the fire under control.
we got one male victim. His name is, uh, Brett Morrison.
any survivors? - Yeah. Claire Gibbs.
they fished her out of the pool.
okay, Frank.
we got a hot spot! Everybody clear out!
let's go! Let's go!
ma'am, come with me, please.
everybody, back up and calm down.
stay away from the vehicle.
we've got the situation under control.
I just bought that car.
you all right? - Yeah.
first, it's a damn land mine. Now it's a flying water heater.
what next?
next, we catch a killer.
Ah, so does the water heater come standard or is that custom?
just got her a week ago.
how the hell could something like this happen?
well, the fire heats the tank, the pressure builds, and, uh...
you stop up the kettle...
Yeah, the kettle will blow.
I wish I could have seen it.
thank you.
ms. Gibbs.
my fianc? He didn't...
he's still in there.
ms. Gibbs, we're aware of that.
look, there's no glass out here.
there's no broken glass on the ground.
it must all be inside, covered by debris, which we can't get to.
someone broke into the house.
could be the arsonist's point of entry.
fire department says we can't get in there until it's safe.
well, hopefully, this print will tell us who it is.
ms. Gibbs, we believe that someone may have deliberately set the fire.
deliberately?
now, can you think of anyone who might want to hurt you or your family?
ms. Gibbs.
I got a restraining order on someone last year.
you want to tell me what happened?
an ex-boyfriend was harassing me.
when I left him, he became obsessed.
he'd come to my work, call me, send me e-mails.
I moved. - And he followed.
all the way from Key West.
when Brett and I got engaged, it, it just sent him over the edge.
Brett, it's me.
he's here again. What should I do?
what's his name?
I don't want to say.
every time I reported him to the police, it just made him angrier.
ms. Gibbs, I need you to trust me.
we don't want him to do this to anyone else.
so what's his name?
I'll find him. Okay?
attention, suspect vehicle spotted, corner of Collins and Eighth.
Anthony Bryant, show yourself.
what are you doing here?
working.
I'm a private investigator now.
I thought Ray Jr. Would have told you.
well, he didn't.
this is Anthony Bryant's car, Yelina.
how did you know?
Anthony Bryant is a suspect in a murder that occurred around dawn.
no, that's impossible.
I was hired to watch him.
I've been following him for the past 12 hours and he's done nothing wrong.
hired by who?
Anthony's lawyer. Said he may be in some trouble.
I planted a GPS monitor.
I was just removing it.
my services were only required through this morning.
of course.
and I was his alibi.
where is he now?
Anthony, on the day that someone tries to kill your ex-girlfriend, you hire a private investigator to follow you around.
why is that?
let's just say that, uh, when you get to know someone
you got to go with your hunches.
in addition, we have burglary, stalking, and arson.
they're all arrests.
no convictions.
I think that's going to change.
look, the "burglary" came a week after Claire and I broke up
when I went back to her place to get my stuff.
I even had a key.
what about the stalking?
she wouldn't call me back when I tried to tell her our dog died.
I mean...
look, this is all Claire making something out of nothing.
and the arson?
you mean the one last year?
we were actually still together then.
we decided to burn stuff our exes gave us.
it was some stupid bonding thing.
I guess a neighbor freaked and called the cops.
you have an excuse for everything, Anthony.
and an airtight alibi.
Yes, and that's going to change, too.
well, I'm assuming he died from his burns.
no.
actually, our boy ate fire.
is that his lung?
what's left of it.
Brett Morrison took a gasp of superheated air.
right, 'cause air can heat up to almost a thousand degrees in a matter of minutes and that would instantly cook your bronchial tubes.
that's right.
and the heat ruptured his alveoli.
he was suffocated.
the fire cooked the rest of him.
luckily for you, hot air wasn't the only thing he ate.
Oh, there's something in his teeth?
what is that?
now, honey, I can't do all your work for you.
thank you.
Hey, Valera, what's my trace sample doing here in DNA?
it was biological.
he had meat in his teeth.
chicken, steak? - Human, actually.
Really?
Brett Morrison must have got in a fight and bit someone.
sure did, and he didn't brush afterwards.
I wonder what that was about.
why don't you ask Michael Lipton?
sure doesn't look like somebody you should be biting.
Oh, definitely not.
okay, thanks. - Sure.
Frank. You got a new car yet?
cause I've got someone I would love for you to pick up.
Hey, Frank, I got your message. What's the emergency?
I got a, uh, suspect that's giving me the silent treatment.
Oh, yeah? You need my, uh, superior interrogation skills to work him over?
keep dreaming, bud.
this guy asked for you.
Oh, yeah? What's his name? - Michael Lipton.
said he's not gonna talk to anybody but you.
you know him?
Ryan. You know this guy?
no, I've never seen this guy before in my life.
our dead man took a bite out of him recently.
you want me to go in with you?
no, I can handle it. Thanks, man.
you've got five seconds to tell me why you brought my name into this.
tell you why, Wolfe.
your buddy Tex says I'm a prime suspect in some murder case.
Oh, yeah?
what the hell do you want me to do about that?
cut me loose.
I didn't do squat.
except for getting in a fight with the victim.
I'm sorry, Lipton.
but you sink or swim around here on the evidence.
you're on your own. Okay?
Hey, I don't need that heat.
you forgetting, Wolfe?
you owe me. Ten grands.
let me tell you something. That has nothing to do with this.
I didn't put those cards in your hand, kid.
you wanted to play poker with the big boys.
I don't have that kind of money.
you make this go away, your debt goes with it.
we're done having this conversation.
Hey. How'd it go in there?
you know, I got interrupted.
something about an old case.
it can't wait?
no, actually, it can't.
do me a favor. Will you go in there and take over for me?
Yeah, sure. I'd be happy to.
Thanks. I appreciate it.
roll up your sleeves, Mr. Lipton.
Why? What for?
because Brett Morrison bit you, and now he's dead.
so go ahead. Do it.
we had a little disagreement.
I hired his company to throw my sister's wedding.
put up a hundred grand for a deposit.
and what happened?
he stiffed me. That's what happened.
backed out at the last minute.
took my money and broke my sister's heart.
so you confronted him.
damn right I did.
I paid you that money in good faith. Cough it up.
my company's going under, okay?
the bank-- they seized our assets, they froze our accounts.
there's nothing I can do about it. - Nothing you can do, huh?
I'll kill you.
so he bit me.
couldn't fight like a man. What's that prove?
proves to me that you had all the motive in the world to kill him.
and who are you?
I'm the person who's gonna take you down for murder.
tough girl, hiding behind that badge.
no one talks to me that way.
Oh, really? Sit down.
now, if I were you, I'd let her go.
it's okay, Horatio. I've got it.
we were just having a discussion.
she's trying to lay a bum rap on me.
if you don't sit down, that's gonna be the least of your problems.
Horatio. - Hey.
I have to say, twice in one day?
that's more than I've seen you in months.
and I apologize for that.
no, I understand completely.
let's just say it's been a rough year for both of us.
why did you want to see me?
michael Lipton just made bail.
and you don't think he should have.
not by a long shot. Could you shadow him for me?
no problem.
I'll see where he hangs out, who he knows.
every step he takes.
Hey.
is that the glass from outside the crime scene?
Yeah. It's the only piece of viable evidence that we've gotten so far.
Yeah, and I am so hoping it puts Michael Lipton at the scene.
guy thinks he's tony soprano, and I just want to put this guy away.
Yeah, I heard about that. You okay?
so, um...
so Calleigh seems to be taking an interest in you since you got back.
Yeah, she...
she's been great, really helpful.
everyone has. - Yeah.
not really what I meant, though.
what? - I...
well, never mind, never mind.
what, you think me and Calleigh...
I saw her kiss you.
only on the cheek.
I'm just, you know, saying...
damn it. That's not my guy.
print on the glass is Ron Cramer.
penny-ante rap sheet.
Yeah, well, it looks like he's playing for higher stakes now.
I'm Calleigh Duquesne. I'm with Miami-Dade Police Department.
I need to ask you a few questions.
about what?
an arson that happened this morning.
could you tell me why your prints are on broken glass at the crime scene?
what? I don't know.
maybe I did a job there in the past.
in fact, I'm late for one now, so excuse me.
get your hands up, Mr. Cramer.
you carry a concealed weapon?
I have a permit for that.
you never know whose house you're walking into.
Oh, I think you did.
there's glass on this gun.
I'm willing to bet it matches the glass from our crime scene.
okay, fine, listen.
I was on my way to an emergency call near there, and I saw smoke coming out of the house.
Hey! Anybody in there?
Hello?
things got crazy.
there was no way I could help, so I got out of there.
why didn't you tell me that?
who's gonna believe a good Samaritan with a gun?
probably no one.
Hey. - Hey.
so you get anything on Ron Cramer?
he copped to being outside the house, but claimed he never went in.
all right, well, now we can prove it.
fire rescue just released the scene, we can go back in.
great. I'll grab my kit.
you want to ride together? - Yeah.
life changes that fast.
how's the MiniRAE coming?
it's picking up octane at five parts per million all over the room.
there's no doubt about it. This was arson.
Yeah, that explains the pour pattern on the floor.
the arsonist poured gasoline everywhere.
it's going to take a while to get through the debris.
Yeah, fire rescue's working that from their angle.
got an arson investigator looking for the point of origin.
maybe we beat him to it.
fire did a number on this, but check it out.
is that a spark wheel? - It's a lighter.
melted plastic around it.
could be our source of ignition.
you know what? You tell the arson investigator where you found it.
I'm gonna take this to the lab.
Calleigh, have you seen Ryan?
no. Why?
well, he said he got a call about an old case.
an old case? Which one?
didn't say. Sounded important.
well, then I'm sure it was.
what you got there? - It's a cigarette lighter.
Eric found it at the crime scene.
so it might have started the fire. - Maybe.
but get this; this is sort of interesting.
the fire compromised evidence on one side But then the plastic melted, and it acted like sort of a cocoon, protecting the other side.
and protecting the evidence.
including a fingerprint. - Nice.
I'm running it against our elimination samples.
doesn't match up with anyone.
Oh, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Claire Gibbs?
isn't that the fiancee?
what is it?
it's Anthony, isn't it?
you weren't able to catch him.
I knew he would get away with this.
he always does.
our evidence has led us in a different direction
yours.
me? You think that I had something to do with this?
we found a lighter on the living room floor with your fingerprint on it.
on a lighter? I don't even smoke.
exactly.
well, I have no idea.
I swear.
wait, I did find a lighter at my house yesterday, but it wasn't mine.
do you have any idea who it belongs to?
Brett's business partner.
he dropped it and I gave it back to him.
what was he doing at the house?
they own a big event planning company.
they do club openings, upscale parties.
do you have any idea what they talked about?
no.
but they argued, and it got pretty heated.
this, uh, business partner-- what's his name?
is this about Brett?
I heard what happened. It's...
it's horrible.
the world keeps turning, right? - Yes, it does.
we found your lighter at Brett's house.
what? Do you think I burned up his place?
no way. I got nothing to do with that.
then why was your lighter get there?
I don't know. I must have dropped it.
I also heard you had an argument with him.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Brett was bringing his personal problems to work.
what kind of problems?
his fiancee's ex-boyfriend, for one.
guy was crazy. He'd show up at our events.
slash the guests' tires.
he'd put dead animals in the air vents.
plug up the toilets. It was a PR nightmare.
so, his problems were affecting your bottom line.
Yeah.
I've been scrambling to make things right. I was going...
was going to buy Brett out.
cut him loose.
Yes, and his death would have been a convenience for you.
where were you last night?
I was at home.
trying to think of a way to save my company.
can anyone verify that?
no. I was alone.
look, I didn't do this.
what can I do to prove that I wasn't involved?
that is my job.
so, why are we out here?
I tracked Michael Lipton to four locations
all of them secluded.
possible drug dealing?
no, I don't think so.
from what I could tell, he's just a bookie.
but I found something else.
something you're not going to like.
I shot this video in north bay village.
what am I looking at?
there is money in this envelope, Horatio.
maybe he had a good reason for it.
what if he doesn't?
H, you wanted to see me?
have a seat, Mr. Wolfe.
Yeah, Michael Lipton is a, uh...
he's a friend of mine. Why do you ask?
you interrogated him this morning.
actually, I recused myself from interrogating him because I, um...
well, I thought it'd be looked on as a...
conflict of interest.
I have a piece of videotape that says otherwise.
I don't know what you saw on that videotape.
Mr. Wolfe, I need to know what's going on.
Michael's a friend of mine.
who's having some sort of financial problems.
and I'm just helping him out.
so this has nothing to do with gambling.
no, this has nothing to do with gambling.
if there's something I should know, this is your opportunity.
no, there's nothing you need to know.
and this is my personal business.
I'd like to keep it that way.
if you don't level with me right now,you're not going to have a choice, you understand?
Yeah, I understand.
are we done?
we're done.
okay.
Hey, you called? - Yeah.
guess what?
our arson investigator discovered that the point of origin is in this room.
the lighter didn't start the fire. -No.
okay, what did?
there's no evidence of slow burn on the floor.
no, there's no gasoline poured in here, which means that the fire was started from the vapors.
it was poured somewhere else in the house and then it just sat there.
Yeah, as time went on, the vapors crept across the floor, making their way to the water heater.
so the pilot light was our heat source. -Yeah.
but if the arsonist wanted fianc
why fire?
I don't know. You're right.
a pro wouldn't chance it.
they would just pour and light. - Yeah.
well, our arsonist is an amateur.
never anticipated this.
maybe they were surprised. Got interrupted.
an amateur pouring gasoline probably splashed himself.
let's get the clothes from all our suspects.
Yeah. If he made this mistake, he probably made others.
let's sift through the rest of the debris.
all right, this is where Ron Cramer broke the glass.
damn it. - What happened?
it's a piece of glass.
hold on a second. Let me see.
that'll teach me to leap before I look.
got it.
look, the glass is clean.
Yeah, there's no smoke stain on it.
no.
you know, your accident might have just turned into our biggest lead.
so, you want to tell me why I'm here?
you didn't go over to the Morrison house to help.
you went over to set it on fire.
please.
what's that supposed to be? - It's glass.
from the window you broke.
now, you said the fire was already raging when you got there, right?
Yeah, it was. - That's impossible.
glass shards from the point of entry show no heat damage
no smoke debris, which means that you broke the window before the fire started.
heat. Fuel. Air.
until you broke the window, the ratio was off.
once you introduced oxygen to the house, there was no turning back.
you could say whatever you want, but I didn't start that fire.
no, you didn't, but you went over there with your gun.
you went over there to kill them, but the fire beat you to it.
it wasn't my idea. - Whose was it?
it was a guy I know. Anthony Bryant.
he sent me over to shoot her boyfriend.
he paid me.
but I ain't pull the trigger.
so, I can go, right?
not even close.
Anthony Bryant? - Yeah?
Miami-Dade PD. - Again?
you know what? I'd hate to see the way you treat actual criminals.
somehow you forgot to tell us you and Ron Cramer know each other.
what are you talking about? - Save it.
you hired your buddy Ron to kill Claire Gibbs's fianc
this is a search warrant for your vehicle and your home.
give me your keys.
give me your keys!
I got a nickel's worth of advice for you, pal.
when a woman says, "get lost," get lost.
find another one. End of story.
no.
I usually keep a map book in my glovebox.
if I had to guess, you stole these from the woman you've been stalking.
I've never seen those in my life. - Oh, really?
you can sit outside her house all night long you can't steal her panties?
you know what I call this, Anthony? - No.
an inciting incident. You catch my drift?
you know what? I didn't burn her house, okay.
I didn't hire my friend to go over and do it.
Yeah. - Yeah.
you're under arrest. Hook him up.
Brett! Help!
thank you for the call, Captain.
so you find anything else?
we were finally able to get upstairs.
something in here you should see.
thank you, gentlemen.
two more victims.
victims of something, but not this fire.
look at the chest there are staples here.
these people have already been through an autopsy.
these bodies were probably moved here.
this fire is starting to look more like a cover-up.
I think it's time we ask our lone survivor a few more questions.
two more bodies at my house?
I don't understand.
they didn't die in the fire, Claire. In fact, they were dead already.
they'd been autopsied, in fact.
do you want to explain to me what happened?
okay, I didn't think so.
so I'm going to tell you what I know.
for starters, you had gasoline on your clothes this morning.
our trace lab just finished processing them.
that's what the person used to start the fire, right?
I'm sure I got it on my clothes when I was trying to escape.
that is not possible.
when gasoline burns, it becomes carbon dioxide.
there was no carbon dioxide on your clothing therefore, it hadn't been burned.
now what I think, is that you got gasoline on your clothes when you doused the floors.
do you want to tell me what happened?
it's Anthony's fault.
he wouldn't leave me alone.
he wouldn't leave us alone.
he did it again, Claire. He did it again.
today at my event, he tripped the sprinklers. Ruined the entire thing!
did you call the police? - And what?
file for another restraining order?
I don't think I can take this anymore, Claire.
this guy is not going to stop until he kills us both.
you're right.
maybe he should.
so you decided to fake your own deaths?
we were willing to give up everything to start over just to be together without him.
and you figured, if you could burn down your house, you'd frame Anthony for your murder.
I put the lingerie in his car, hoping that the cops would find it.
what about the cadavers?
Brett took care of that.
he got them from the science department at Dade University.
okay. You know, what I can't figure out is what were the two of you doing in bed when the fire started?
Anthony would park outside of our house every night.
so I poured the gasoline...
and we waited.
you sure he's going to show?
don't worry. He'll be here.
he's more predictable than a sunrise.
so you were going to start the fire when Anthony showed up hoping that a witness would place him there.
but he didn't show.
the one night he needed to, and he didn't.
and Brett and I fell asleep.
and you didn't realize that the vapors from the gas had filled the house and the flame from the water heater ignited it.
Brett, wake up. What is that?
I should have been the one that died.
and now Brett's gone.
he did it.
he won.
Anthony won.
I'm sorry Claire. I really am.
but Anthony didn't win, and we're going to make sure of that.
have a seat, Anthony.
she did it, didn't she?
is Claire going to jail?
no thanks to you, my friend.
should've never left me.
think she'll get visitation rights?
I want you to understand something you're never going to see her again.
and you lied to me. - About what?
the lingerie?
Partly...I never took it.
but I did know it was there.
it was too weird.
I knew she was up to something.
which is why you hiring a private investigator, isn't it?
Yeah, a good-looking one, too.
you got her number?
I saw you with her by my car.
the way she looks at you...
think she could look at me like that?
you were so sure I killed that guy.
you did hire Ron Cramer to go over to the house.
what? Try proving that.
I already have. We cut a deal with Ron.
I have the check you used to pay him.
so I paid him.
you said it yourself.
Claire caused the fire.
Yes, but Ron broke the window, Anthony, which made the place an inferno.
and in my world, they call that conspiracy to commit murder.
no way.
I have something new for you to obsess about.
it's called row of steel bars.
officer...
I can't let you on this floor, Wolfe.
what? - Well, you're fired.
your gun and your badge, please.
you know, I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand.
what I did...
I did to protect all the people in this lab.
you understand that? - You don't get it.
because of your actions, cases are being reopened.
criminals are going to be out on the streets.
your personal belongings will be sent to you.
I need your gun and I need your badge...now.
what am I supposed to do now?
get out of the building.
I heard you got Anthony.
I appreciate your help on this.
it's part of the job.
speaking of which, Yelina, PI work can be very dangerous.
ray was killed while breaking the law.
I was denied his pension. I have to work...
I was a cop.
I can take care of myself.
I'm concerned about people like Anthony Bryant.
I understand.
really, but I have Ray Junior to think about.
my point exactly.
always looking after me, huh?
I always will.
I'll be more selective next time.
Oh, my god.
the sun's coming up.
how did it get so late?
you know it's not too late to go to Nikki beach.
the guys are cuter.
let's walk.
you want to walk to Nikki beach?
all right, you are drunker than I am.
maybe we'll get lucky.
scary.
sexy.
hop on.
well, he's kind of like a cab.
Hey, you know where Nikki beach is?
whoa, no, no, no. I don't know if that's such a good idea.
it's cheaper than a cab.
we can't even both fit on there.
the way I plan to hold on to him, we can.
see, Shell?
you know what, I'm just going to have the valet guy call me a cab.
but I'll meet you there.
hey...
Hey, you...
don't you want to know my name?
Oh, my god. What happened?
help!
someone!
detective Berkeley.
dispatch said we have a stabbing.
I'd say multiple.
okay, and her clothes indicate a sexual assault.
she's got biological fluid on her thighs.
I didn't touch the body.
I used a mirror.
I'll have Dr. Woods collect a kit as soon as she gets in.
let's do that.
I noticed that the binding looks like fishing line.
please stop!
please leave me alone!
you swept the house?
couldn't find anything made of that material.
okay, and we have no sign of the murder weapon?
tore the place apart. Nothing.
that means that our guy brought a killing kit.
so he brings the tools to the murder and takes them when he leaves.
that's correct.
that's hard-core.
these wounds are just brutal.
I'll get the sexual assault kit to the lab.
okay.
tell me about the knife.
there may be two.
how do you mean two?
these incised wounds have serrated margins, but this cut...
the margin is clean.
alexx, is that a "y"?
it is.
but there's no blood, so this was done postmortem.
he'd already killed her.
now he was spending time with her.
from a straight-edge blade.
Yes.
alexx, that "y" could be a signature.
so he used one blade for killing and one for leaving a message.
so you did not see Shelly in the rearview of the motorcycle?
no.
did you see anyone approach her-- a guy hitting on her?
a lot of guys were waiting for their cars.
I figured she'd get a ride.
what about the guy on the motorcycle?
do you think he could have seen someone approach her?
maybe.
but I don't know his name.
I'm sorry. You don't know his name?
he paid for bottle service at Nikki beach.
but when I wouldn't...you know, pay him back, he got mad and left.
he left?
when I told him where I lived, he said it was too far, so I went for eggs at Duke's...and then came home.
what time approximately did this motorcycle guy leave you at Nikki beach?
5: 00, 5:30.
frees him up during time of death.
I gave him the address.
I'm such an idiot.
Alexis, you're not an idiot.
and, in fact, you can really help us if you could remember the exact cabana number you were in.
I don't remember the number, but I can probably show you where it is.
no, that one.
it's okay. Take your time.
no, it was that one with the broken chaise.
are you sure?
I remember 'cause his boots were too heavy and kind of fell through.
I'm drinking my slow screw on the beach.
I like the sound of that.
Damn!
that broke his mood.
what about the umbrella?
this is the only cabana without one.
he threw it.
first I thought he was going to throw it at me.
he threw it 'cause I wouldn't have sex.
you're nothing but a tease.
if I'm lucky, that's metal.
homicide, female, 20 years 9, 643 cases used 2 knives: 1 serrated, 1 clean edge 1, 683 cases placement upper torso: carving in the shape of the letter "Y"
3 cases Boston
age: 20 years old; 21 years old; 20 years old hair: blonde How'd your court appearance go?
not too important in light of the fact. Oh, you're working my case now?
I'm working a homicide.
my homicide.
prior victims were all in Boston.
all bound with fishing wire.
Serrated-edge knife...and "y" with the smooth one.
what does the "y" stand for?
nobody knows.
no suspect names?
no suspects.
three killings in Boston and then none.
well, he's either inactive...or he's moved to Miami.
Yeah.
so you picked up a girl outside a club and now her roommate is dead.
well, I invited that one to come with.
she didn't want to.
Hey, you know where Nikki beach is?
whoa, no, no, no.
hop on.
did you jump her roommate at Nikki beach so you could go over and kill her?
we know you had her address.
Hey, last I saw, she didn't want to get on my bike.
and then her friend started yapping in my ear-- did I know her name?
never looked back again.
Frank, check his knife, please.
serrated near the hilt, flat edge near the tip.
one knife for mo and signature.
what the hell's that mean?
it means don't go far.
is the biker's knife a match?
Shelly was killed with a knife that had a six-inch serrated blade.
Travis' blade is serrated for only about an inch.
do you have anything, and I mean anything at all?
I found skin underneath her fingernails.
Accordioned.
you find your guy...
he's gonna look like he's been in a fight.
with a cat.
that Boston, Frank?
spoke to an Officer Malloy.
it's his case up there.
confirms the mos are the same.
college girls stumbling out of clubs...
they never saw the sun rise.
never a person of interest.
in fact, the killer was really good.
he left almost nothing behind in any of his scenes.
define "almost."
well, they recovered fishing line tied around the victims' hands and fish scales on the wound of his first Boston victim.
fish scale.
Yeah.
marine biologist identified it in Latin as "Sciaenops Ocellatus."
redfish, Frank.
Yeah, very popular up in Boston.
if he's looking to catch from down here, there's only one spot.
mosquito lagoon.
let's go.
think that's our guy?
scratches are not fresh.
but those are.
just about to gut her.
y'all want to watch?
grab his knife, Frank.
I got four hours on my shift, man.
your shift is over.
you never expect to see your one-night stand leading off the morning edition.
so, Lucas, you admit to knowing her?
picked her up at a club.
we had, uh, like interests.
well, that looks tasty.
Hey.
friend ditched you, huh?
uh, yeah, but...
she's my roommate, so...no hard feelings.
I'll make sure you get home safe.
sure.
and then you killed her?
can't cop to that.
sorry.
is that all you got, guys?
if I were you, I'd sit down.
Why?
you want to pin other Miami murders on me?
actually, we're talking about Boston murders.
Boston?
that's right. We forgot to mention that we know you used to live in Boston, and similar murders just happened to stop right after you moved.
and now, all of them are going to stop.
what is it, Sergeant Stetler?
I'm busy.
besides, I already got one of your iab hacks looking over my shoulder while I go over every case I've ever worked.
Yeah, to get out ahead of appeals, I know.
so if you don't mind, the sooner I finish, the sooner I'll be reinstated.
Well...maybe not.
what do you mean?
well, I figured a guy gambles on duty, he's got to get lucky every now and then, so we checked your bank records.
what's your point?
my point...
about a month before you transferred out of patrol to csi, you made a cash deposit in the amount of $6, 400.
Where'd that come from?
I honestly have no idea.
well, I think you better go through every speeding ticket and moving violation you issued and get one.
do you honestly think that I took money from a traffic stop?
I didn't think that you would gamble on duty.
so now, account for that money before day's end or it's over.
for real, Wolfe.
Hey.
Hey.
with Lucas Wade in custody, looks like we can finally have that dinner.
well, those are famous last words.
you know every time we try, something happens.
should we just say it's a sign?
no, I'm just gonna have to work harder to finish earlier.
excuse me.
I was wondering if one of you might help me.
do you know where I go to post bail?
for whom would you like to post bail?
he's my brother.
there hasn't been a bail hearing yet.
I just assumed.
he called and said to come get him.
miss Wade, he may not get bail.
look, if there's any more info, could you call me?
Absolutely. We can do that.
miss Wade, why don't you come inside so we can better explain to you what's going on with your brother.
okay.
Hey.
everything okay?
Yeah.
just got the DNA results from Lucas Wade's semen sample.
the DNA from our victim's body matches Lucas Wade.
but that doesn't prove that he killed our victim.
it only proves he had sex with her.
Oh, but this might.
the amelogenin y is twice as concentrated as it should be.
the donor's xyy.
so he has an extra y chromosome?
that's the criminal gene.
well, that's what they used to call it.
some studies from the '70s said that an extra y chromosome meant a man was more aggressive.
so Wade was born to kill.
that's why he carves the y on his victims' chest.
means he's aware of his condition.
wonder how much he knows.
I think it's time to talk to someone who can tell us.
can I get my brother now?
I'm afraid not, Miss Wade.
your brother has an extra y chromosome.
now this is where most people would usually ask me what on earth I'm talking about.
when Lucas was born, he was part of a study that tested for genetic defects.
at a prestigious Boston university.
I'm familiar with the study.
is that where the abnormality was first discovered?
they told my parents that he had the criminal gene, that he was prone to violence.
he exhibited signs of it early on, killing animals and bullying kids at school.
how did your parents react to that?
my dad called him a freak... ...a mistake.
I tried to be there for him.
he just became unreachable.
so even though that theory was debunked, the damage had been done.
your brother thought he was born to kill.
and that's when the Boston killings started.
I never thought that that could be him.
call me crazy, but I still don't.
he's your brother.
I understand.
miss Wade, I do think it's entirely possible that you may have to face that as a reality.
the y marking's consistent with this morning's killing.
we're still looking for the murder weapon.
victim's name is Jennifer Royce.
she died in the last three hours.
Lucas Wade has been in our custody for four.
who called it in, Eric?
her son, Arthur.
came home from school, found her like this.
he won't talk to anyone.
he'll talk to me.
Arthur, my name's Horatio Caine.
can you tell me what happened?
the door was open after school.
mom never leaves it like that.
okay.
did you see anyone leaving?
I heard something in the kitchen.
I don't know.
is he coming back?
Arthur, I don't want you to worry about him.
you're safe now.
is he coming back for it?
what do you mean "for it," son?
what are you talking about?
he forgot this.
I took it out of my mom.
I didn't want it to hurt her anymore.
Arthur, you're very brave.
thank you.
I appreciate your help, son.
what's the story with this knife?
that knife killed Jennifer Royce and Shelly Seaver.
the DNA confirms it.
so we've got just one murder weapon.
which supports the theory that someone other than Lucas Wade did this.
but then why would they leave the knife?
it seems like the son came home and scared him off.
wait a second.
this has a changeable blade.
whoever put the blade into the housing accidentally preserved their own print.
I see something here.
Yeah.
bingo.
okay, he's my boyfriend. So what?
no, Rita, Lucas is a serial killer, and you could have helped us catch him, but instead, you stabbed someone to help him look innocent.
you did it while we had Lucas in custody.
I'd like to see you prove that.
how about we've got your fingerprints on the knife that was used to kill two people?
all I did was help pack his fishing kit for him.
you need anything else, sweetie?
just fish biting.
happy hunting.
it always is.
be back tomorrow.
no, what you did was pack his murder kit and that makes you an accomplice.
I didn't know.
I thought he was going fishing.
no, he went to kill Shelly Seaver.
what happens now?
you're still a suspect in the copycat murder, but you just convicted your boyfriend.
can we stop for food?
I hear they got a baloney sandwich waiting for you at the jail.
put your arms down.
I'm just getting comfy.
these things are heavy...
I don't care.
put your arms down.
what was that?
hang on!
I've got an officer down.
request medical assistance immediately!
immediately!
I'm okay.
sorry, I didn't see that coming.
okay.
neither will he, brother.
neither will he.
that's a dead officer, Eric.
the case just became capital.
how's Jake?
he's banged up pretty bad.
I just sent him to the hospital.
Lucas escaped into those woods over there.
all right, I'll get the metal detector and check it out.
do that, Eric.
we've got a cop-killer.
I spoke the er.
Jake is going to be okay.
I'm sure he would love for you to go visit him at the hospital.
Hey, you know what? I came to see you at the hospital, too.
Yeah, that was different.
it is different because you and I work together.
you work with Jake, too.
he's in homicide.
you and I are in the lab day and night.
you know that I trust you with my life.
I don't even know how I feel about Jake yet.
all right, maybe we should get back to work.
we got something.
somebody cut the handcuffs off and then buried them.
it confirms he's got an accomplice.
lucky for us no one stepped on them.
whoever kicked the dirt around it left a real nice footprint.
it's a biker boot.
and I know exactly which biker.
we found that tire iron on your motorcycle.
do my own repairs.
well, that's a miracle, since motorcycles don't use them.
you did time in Boston.
Yeah, Cedar Junction.
a lot of guys did time there.
how many guys domiciled in a cell next to Lucas Wade for a year?
the list shrinks to you.
all right.
let's start it simple.
Lucas see a girl he liked, she had a friend, I'd step in, make sure she didn't get in the way.
that's the one, the blonde.
I'll keep her friend out of your way for a couple of hours.
saddle up, cowboy.
so you helped him kill a girl.
then you loosened lug nuts on a police vehicle after he got caught.
what he's doing...is what we all want to.
he's a hunter.
I understand him.
Really?
well...
Wannabe...help us understand that.
why'd Lucas choose this woman?
no, he'd never pick this chick.
too old, hair's too dark.
did you kill her while he was in custody?
wish I did.
wonder what it feels like to kill a person.
well, you're in luck.
Why?
a police officer died in that van.
makes you guilty of felony murder.
so, how does it feel?
just give me a second.
Hey.
Ryan, what's wrong?
I could have stopped Lucas Wade.
do you know that?
what are you talking about?
you're not even on his case.
I pulled him over a few years ago.
he gave a Boston address.
he was driving slowly and suspiciously, and, uh...
I should have known something was up.
I thought he was just another tourist.
you are being way too hard on yourself.
the green river killer, the night stalker -
they were pulled over before they were finally arrested.
those aren't on me.
this one is.
who knows how many women I could have saved?
how's it going?
Boston finally got us the autopsy protocols from their "y" killer.
these three are from Boston.
this last one, Shelly Seaver from this morning.
okay, so will you tell me what I'm looking for?
angle of entry.
the skin tore to the left when Wade stuck his blade into make his signature.
consistent with him being right-handed.
exactly.
approach from the right, tear to the left.
Now...here's Jennifer Royce.
it's torn the opposite way.
which means our killer is left-handed.
lefties do a lot of things opposite.
angle of handwriting, keys in pocket.
the way they wear their watches because it's easier to work the clasp with the dominant hand.
look, if there's any more info, could you call me?
Absolutely. We can do that.
it's the sister.
miss Wade, you're under arrest.
I'm sorry I killed her, but...Lucas is my brother.
he had to look innocent.
miss Wade, who attacked you?
my brother.
I thought he came here to hide.
where is she?
leave my little girl out of this.
Lucas, please!
get off!
my baby.
Oh, my god, my baby!
okay, we'll find him.
attention. Missing child less than 24 hours.
Holly wade, two years old, blonde hair, blue eyes.
will you tell me what you're looking for?
Lindsay couldn't tell us where her brother went, so something has to.
I have a hard time feeling sorry for her, since she killed Jennifer Royce, and, I think she's probably covering for him.
he has her little girl, Calleigh.
Yeah, but still, she's a murderer.
family psychologies run deep.
they make you do things you never thought you were capable of.
Yeah, you're right.
so you mind finishing up here?
I'm gonna go check on something.
I'll collect the little girl's things.
any luck?
no.
no trace of Lucas on anything.
he bugged himself.
this is the receiving end of a child locator.
you know this how?
cause I got nieces and they all have these little teddy bears that are attached to their shoelaces.
so this is going to tell us where he is?
well, here is the bad news.
the bad news is it only has a range of about 150 yards.
okay, so how are we going to narrow it down?
Lucas Wade isn't going to go anywhere we can find him.
unless one of us already did.
you got more bad news for me?
not at all.
remember I said you weren't working on this case?
Yeah.
that was so wrong.
Really?
well, how can I help you?
that ticket that you gave Wade when you caught him prowling -- where was it?
it was at a warehouse in Pinecrest. Why?
well, you may not have caught him the first time, but I think you just made up for it.
so, I'm looking at old Boston Herald microfiche...
Why?
searching for hits on Lucas Wade.
there's something we're missing.
it's easy to see why parents believe it when a study says something is true.
people listen.
wait. So the extra y chromosome doesn't lead to violence?
I looked into it.
there's no science to support it.
the extra y means nothing at all.
so what makes this guy a killer?
that does.
he killed his sister.
and Lindsay was an eyewitness.
I'm not so sure that's true.
you know, I kept thinking about Jennifer Royce.
and then I was wondering about you and how could a 30-year-old woman kill so easily on the spur of the moment?
and then I realized...that your brother was the only one who knew that you had killed before.
that's not what it says in the article.
your baby sister Emma was four years old.
she was standing at the top of the stairs.
you were six.
Lucas was eight.
only he did not push her for taking his turn.
in fact...it was an accident.
but it was not his.
it was yours, wasn't it?
miss Wade, they may have believed you in Boston, but I am not buying it, so let's hear it.
mom was taking a nap.
we were sledding down the stairs.
and you pushed Emma too hard.
mommy, mommy, come quick!
Oh, my god, what happened?!
Lucas did it.
no, I didn't.
course you did.
they warned us about you.
get out of my sight!
be very easy to blame your brother because he was...born bad?
I never forgave myself.
that's why you killed the second time.
to save him.
you figured if there was a y murder while he was in custody, we'd have to drop the charges.
the first time was an accident, but Jennifer Royce is murder.
what about my baby?
don't worry, Miss Wade.
we actually do know how to save people.
when it's in range, it'll beep, but on his end, too.
Yeah. So that means we need to be good to go.
wait a minute.
this is it.
you don't understand, Caine.
I do understand, Lucas.
Lindsay killed your sister, but let Holly go.
I can't.
I have to protect her from Lindsay.
and I have to protect her from you.
let her go, Lucas.
I wasn't going to hurt her.
prove it, Lucas.
get down on the ground right now.
cuff him.
Holly, it's okay.
come here.
come on, now.
ready? One, two...three.
mommy, mommy, come quick!
Oh, my god, what happened?!
Lucas did it.
no, I didn't.
think someone followed us here?
no way, man.
check it out.
you see something?
get outta here!
detective Tripp off patrol?
Yeah.
my rotation ended yesterday. I'm officially back in homicide.
who we have?
dockworkers reported gunfire in this building, Frank.
saw a couple uniforms back there.
they look pretty shaken up.
come on inside.
what the hell happened here?
where are the victims?
they were vaporized, Frank.
vaporized how?
I don't know, but it was big.
who could've done this?
not who... what.
this has all the earmarks of a gun-smuggling operation, but why'd they leave all those guns behind?
because this was not a robbery, Frank.
what, you mean, a... turf war?
runners trying to take out their competition?
someone is sending a message.
what's the move?
we call the ATF right now.
I got friends over there. I'll take care of it.
you okay?
I've never seen anything like this.
I don't know if we're ever gonna be able to tell how many people died here today.
there were three.
how can you tell?
because I found the remains of three pairs of shoes.
well, we're gonna get these guys.
we'd better.
hoping that this can tell us who our shooters are.
you mean shooter.
you gotta be kidding me. All of these rounds?
you think they were all fired from one gun? One person?
do you see this round?
it requires no casing, and every other one I've picked up is exactly the same.
there is only one weapon I know that can fire something like this.
its nickname is "the vaporizer."
never heard of it.
that's because it's illegal.
it's an electronic gun.
it has over 200 individually fired barrels.
when the trigger is pulled, an electronic current hits a primer on the back of each round.
because there are no moving parts, there's nothing to slow it down.
it's capable of firing a hundred thousand rounds per minute.
I'd seen something like this on paper, but I didn't know it existed yet.
well, it does.
someone in Miami has one.
if we don't find it, we're gonna see a lot more crime scenes like this one.
Yeah.
I'll get this to the lab.
Hey.
Hey.
so, have you, uh... have you seen the crime scene photos?
it was... It was a bloodbath.
I heard.
I'm waiting for the results from the cigarette Delko found on the scene.
hopefully that'll help.
be able to get any I. D. on the vics?
I'm running them, too, but... I only have the blood from their shoes.
hopefully, they're in codis.
well, if they're in codis, chances are they weren't... innocent bystanders, if you know what I mean.
and you'd be right.
take a look.
and check out their criminal history.
trafficking and smuggling firearms.
makes it official. Gunrunners.
looks like somebody wanted to end their career.
and I think I can tell you who.
DNA on the cigarette belongs to Gabriel Soto?
and look what Gabriel has in common with our victims.
Yeah. Gunrunning.
triple murder, Mr. Soto.
I didn't kill nobody.
those guys, they work for me.
then those were your guns at the warehouse, weren't they?
I'm not saying that.
so what are you saying?
look, I got nothing to tell you.
I wasn't even there.
we have evidence that says otherwise.
what evidence?
your DNA on a cigarette butt.
I do business there. I could've dropped it days ago. I'm an antiques dealer.
you deal illegal weapons. - Give me a break.
your guys were unloading a shipment of guns and maybe your buyer didn't feel like paying for them.
look, make it easy on yourself, all right?
why don't you give us the name of your buyer?
and why would I cooperate with you?
because it might get us to a killer.
don't you want to know who did this to your men?
I got my own way of dealing with that.
so do I.
you're under arrest.
take him.
go ahead.
I'll make bail.
I'll be out in two hours. - Just get outta here.
you Sergeant Tripp?
Yes, I am. This is CSI Wolfe.
how you doing?
sergeant tripp, Agent Thorpe.
special Task Force, US Customs. - Hi.
we were, uh, expecting ATF.
yeah? Well, they called me.
this is about the smuggling operation at the docks, right?
okay, so, uh... this is a Customs operation.
Yes, it was.
those weapons were headed to the Middle East, where they'd end up being used on our own troops.
well, you forgot to collect the guns.
well, this mission was just to shut 'em down.
we planned to send in a cleanup crew, but you beat us to it.
well, don't you think you guys went a little bit overboard with the, uh, with the firepower?
what are you talking about?
what I'm talking about is your operation gunned down three men in cold blood, and they didn't even get a single shot off.
actually, I shouldn't be discussing an ongoing operation.
okay. Fair enough.
what about the DX-4?
the vaporizer?
Yeah.
that gun's illegal in this country.
that's right. So why were your guys using it?
this wasn't our operation, strictly speaking.
customs just had oversight.
we, uh... contracted this one out.
contract... wha-what is that supposed to mean?
you used a private security firm.
it's an army for hire.
we've been leaning on them for tactical support.
they did the port operation themselves.
did they have a name?
Mr. Lancaster.
lieutenant.
so you're Peregrine Security.
guns for hire.
I'm afraid there's just not at lot I can tell you.
and I don't agree.
you have no jurisdiction in this case.
I'm gonna have to ask you gentlemen to leave.
Oh, we can be right back with a warrant.
won't do you any good.
you have zero authority in this building.
sergeant. Stand down. Please.
look, I'll try and save you some time.
Yes, that was our operation this morning, sanctioned by U. S. Customs.
so you gunned down those men?
there was collateral damage, yes.
and you're admitting to murder.
it isn't murder under the PATRIOT Act.
what does the PATRIOT Act have to do with this?
as federal contractors, Peregrine is protected from all prosecution in official operations.
gentlemen, forgive me, but from where I'm standing, you're just common killers.
we're patriots.
does a patriot use a weapon that's illegal in this country?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
we know about the vaporizer.
look, gentlemen, I understand that it's difficult for you to see the big picture, but the world is much larger than just Miami.
what we do over here saves American lives overseas.
I will not apologize for our mission.
that magic gun of yours, why don't you just hand it over?
I think we're done here.
not hardly, Mr. Lancaster.
dispatch, this is air-12. We're responding to Sandcrest Park.
Air-12 be advised, victim is Steve Lancaster, head of Peregrine Security.
possible D.O.A.
his name is Steve Lancaster.
you know what? There's no obvious cause of death here.
there's no blood, there's no gunshot wound, there's no stab mark.
not a mark on him.
it's like he laid down and died.
I'm sure he had help.
now wait a second. Hey, guys...
get your hand off me.
excuse me. You cannot be here.
this is a secured crime scene, all right? Hey...
that SUV is Peregrine property.
I need to collect what's inside.
national security issues.
that's all well and good, pal, but murder investigation trumps whatever it is you're doing, so you're gonna have to get lost, okay?
get behind the yellow tape or I'll take you into custody myself.
this isn't over.
not by a long shot.
beat it.
Mr. Wolfe, let's get Alexx out here.
what have you got?
I found an unspent round on the seat, and I think I've got Lancaster's laptop.
wonder if that's what Peregrine was so hot to get their hands on.
check out this tattoo.
looks like our mercenary used to be a Navy S.E.A.L.
I didn't see any signs of a struggle in there.
you think he would have fought back.
I think I know why he didn't.
burn marks.
my guess, someone hit him with a stun gun.
Yeah, but that wouldn't be powerful enough to kill him.
no, but it could knock you out for a good ten minutes.
that's long enough to finish up the job.
so they hit him with a stun gun and then strangle him?
no.
his lips aren't blue, no signs of petechia.
so what are you thinking?
these kind of people, they want a murder to be invisible.
like an assassination.
exactly.
and I have a hunch how they did it.
Natalia told me that you had a crackerjack autopsy going on, but that you wouldn't tell her what you were doing.
Calleigh, you know I don't like to jinx my theories before I've had a chance to test 'em out.
but you came at the right time.
so what killed him?
a bubble.
come again?
if I'm right, it was an air embolism that took our soldier down.
so you mean like when a person gets an air bubble in their vein?
that's right.
travels to the heart, gets stuck in the valves and stops the heart from beating.
only way to know for sure is to submerge the heart in water.
if there's air inside, it'll float to the surface.
I am now going to cut the right ventricle.
and there's your killer bubble.
so this was no accident.
no way.
circulatory system is airtight.
the only way to get air in your veins is to have it forced in.
like with a syringe.
so somebody killed him.
problem is you are looking at the perfect murder.
it is almost impossible to trace this back to the killer.
what about the injection site?
could you find something there?
maybe.
Oh, this killer was so smart.
lieutenant Caine, Darren Butler, current CEO of Peregrine Security.
current CEO?
well, that didn't take long, did it?
steve was a good leader, Lieutenant, but we move on.
can't distract from the mission.
was killing Steve a part of the mission?
I don't know what you're talking about.
steve was murdered.
and how does that relate to Peregrine?
we found a DX-4 round in Lancaster's SUV.
is that where he was storing the vaporizer?
I don't know anything about that.
but if Steve was involved with the use of that weapon, then he crossed the line.
of course, we'll never know now. He's dead.
Yes, how convenient for you.
lieutenant, off the record, you're looking at us when you should be looking outside.
so you're saying Steve had enemies.
plenty.
I'm gonna need those names.
I'm sorry, but those files are confidential.
you'll just have to find them on your own.
Yes, and I will.
and a word to the wise, Mr. Butler, your name better not be amongst them.
Oh, yeah. Got a nice juicy partial right here on the clasp.
nice.
hopefully, that will give us our killer and not our victim.
here we go. James Reilley.
any priors?
no, his record's pristine.
why is he in AFIS then?
says he was in the Navy.
all military personnel get fingerprinted when they enlist.
steve Lancaster was a Navy S.E.A.L.
I wonder if they knew each other.
there's only one way to find out.
look, I'm really sorry that Steve is dead, but I don't see what that has to do with me.
we found your fingerprint on his watchband.
Oh, come on. Are you kidding?
is that why I'm here?
I ran into Steve today.
it must have happened when I, when we shook hands.
I was on my way to see a client, and we just bumped into each other.
Hey, you got a minute?
you want to grab something to eat?
actually, I can't, man. I got to run.
he seemed like he was in a rush.
I haven't seen Steve since I left Peregrine.
so you worked at Peregrine Security?
for a while.
steve brought me in to set up the computer systems.
why'd you leave?
well, I guess I just didn't want the life anymore.
after all the years in the Navy and then Peregrine,
I just got tired of playing war.
I run a computer repair firm now.
where did you go after you saw Steve?
I went back to the office.
you can ask my secretary.
I will.
is that Lancaster's laptop?
I thought it came up empty for any evidence of the killer.
Yeah, well, that's why I wanted to crack it open, see if we got any information that will point us in the right direction.
um, well, I'll take any direction at this point.
I heard you talked to Reilly's secretary.
Yeah, she confirmed his story, but she may be covering for him.
wait. Will you pop open that report?
sure.
operation black market status.
that sounds like plans for a military action.
what does "asset out of the bag" mean?
asset -- in military jargon, that means a target.
"three bogies in play" means three enemies involved.
three is the number of victims at the warehouse shooting this morning.
I think these are the plans.
all right, take a look at this.
mission status: Stage one incomplete.
well, if this morning was stage one, I wonder what else they have planned.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
I'm not doing anything. The laptop's doing this on its own.
someone's purging the hard drive. They're doing it remotely.
they were just waiting for us to turn the computer on.
turn it off.
I can't. They're overriding it.
well, can you figure out who's doing it?
I'm transmitting an output signal, but..
once the computer's wiped out, all trace of whoever is doing this will be gone..
I'm synched in to their satellite transmission.
it's looking for a source.
we have to hurry. It's wiped out 75% of the hard drive.
it's narrowed it down to South Florida.
85%. Come on.
we're running out of time.
we're almost there.
it's gone.
wait a minute.
an address.
that's the address to Peregrine's headquarters.
they wiped out their own computer.
they're covering up something really big.
you've been tampering with the evidence, Mr. Butler.
it's not tampering when you're sanitizing your own computer files.
it is if you're interfering in a murder investigation.
we have to insure our information doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
you mean like mine?
there was nothing in there that would have pertained to Steve's death.
Mr. Lancaster was killed because the operation black market wasn't completed this morning.
you don't know what you're talking about.
educate me.
okay, lieutenant. You were right about Lancaster.
he exceeded our protocols, and used the DX-4 in the dock operation.
the vaporizer.
we were going to turn over that gun to the feds, but it was never returned to base.
so the mission is incomplete until we reacquire the vaporizer.
so it was in his SUV.
where it was stolen when he was murdered.
you're telling me that the most dangerous weapon on the planet is loose on the streets of Miami.
I'm sorry, do I... do I smell pork?
you do.
I'm using pig flesh because it's the closest thing to human flesh that I could find.
I'm trying to tie Peregrine to the Lancaster murder.
I didn't know that stun guns were traceable.
well, it isn't like a regular gun, but if the mark is unique enough...
I mean, for example, this is the Lancaster stun bite.
you can see how the prongs are close together.
if I can match this model to one of these...
I think we might be able to find our killer.
it's what I suspected.
meet the sentry -- the world's smallest stun gun.
you're telling me that that tiny thing took down a 200-pound guy?
well, it kicks out a million volts.
you know, it's funny-- I would think those Peregrine guys were such a boy's club, they wouldn't use such a girly little weapon.
well, I only ended up testing it against government issue stun guns, and I figured that's what Peregrine would be using.
what kind of government agencies?
state Department, Customs Agents.
customs Agents?
Yeah.
where you going?
what's this all about, Wolfe?
it's about your stun gun. - Excuse me?
you carry a sentry, is that right?
Yes. They're issued to us.
so Steve Lancaster's murder -
was that a State-sponsored assassination or did you do that on your own?
what the hell are you talking about?
Lancaster was murdered with a sentry.
the very same model stun gun you carry.
and why would I have a reason to kill Lancaster?
well, the vaporizer.
I'm trying to stop that weapon just like you.
now you are.
see, you're the liaison for Peregrine, but you didn't know they were using that weapon until I told you, is that right?
uh-uh, I can't be held responsible for what they do.
well, your supervisors can.
when it gets out in the public that you hired a company to do your dirty work that's using illegal weapons, you're gonna take the fall.
I think you killed Lancaster to get the gun.
I think if there was no gun...
no problem.
you got nothing to base that on.
is that right?
every time you use that stun gun, the date and time is recorded.
why don't you hand it over.
here.
but don't let my supervisors hear.
my job is already on the line for how this was handled.
if they hear that I'm now a suspect...
if this tests positive...
your job is going to be the least of your worries.
okay, okay, what's wrong?
I was just...
I was convinced that our customs agent killed Lancaster, but she didn't fire her stun gun.
she didn't even fire it once.
so, uh... we don't have a suspect.
well, baby... maybe this will help you out.
what is this?
you tell me.
they look like black specks.
where did you find these?
in our victim's eye.
I found the injection site -- in his retinal vein.
a syringe was the last thing our soldier saw.
Alexx... This is huge.
if trace can tell us what these black specks are, we may have our man.
steve Lancaster, Mr. Reilly.
what about him?
you killed him.
we found out about an interesting tool you use to service computer equipment.
the next time you kill somebody with a syringe, you should try cleaning the toner out first.
you know what, this is harassment.
I am not the only computer salesman in Miami.
but you had a motive.
and what is that motive?
revenge.
I'm out of here.
sit down, Mr. Reilly.
now, we ran into a security firewall with your employment records.
so we called in a few favors at the State Department.
and it turns out that you didn't quit at Peregrine, you were fired.
I was not fired.
you cannot fire the founder of a company.
Lancaster founded Peregrine.
that's what it says on the revised brochures.
peregrine was my idea.
I came up with it back in the S.E.A.L.s.
that's when I met Steve.
I brought him on as a partner.
so how did he force you out?
I was spending so much time engineering coups in other countries.
I didn't see the one he was pulling on me.
so you assassinated him.
Lancaster betrayed Peregrine.
it was a noble idea and he turned it into a killing machine.
should have held true to your own ideals.
the world is better off.
what the hell do you want?
at least I completed my mission.
was part of that mission to steal the DX-4?
I don't know what you're talking about.
the gun-- you took it from Lancaster's SUV.
no, I didn't.
I swear.
someone must have stolen it after I left.
I hope so for your sake.
take him.
Eric, let's take another look at that SUV.
Hey. I got a human hair... with a bulb.
beautiful.
I'll have Natalia and put a name to it.
no, man.
you got the wrong guy.
I'm here to see Soto about a job.
well, where is he?
he's right there.
you made bail, Soto, but you might be going right back in.
you hiring new staff?
I need to replace the men I lost after Peregrine wiped them out.
you need more manpower now that you have the vaporizer to sell.
that'll be a little difficult since I don't have it.
Yeah, well, I can put you in Lancaster's SUV, exactly where the gun was stolen from.
and how can you do that?
because I found your hair in the front seat.
you deliver that DX-4, I bring the buyer.
we'll split it 50-50.
and why does he want the vaporizer?
he wants to mass produce it.
he's willing to pay big for it.
well, if that's the case, then I'll just contact him myself.
you can't do that.
he only deals with me.
not if you're dead.
Oh, man.
I didn't steal anything.
look... I met with Lancaster, you know, to talk.
you were just chatting it up with the guy who killed your men?
no, I don't think so.
it was before that.
I was looking to buy the vaporizer gun from him, okay?
I could retire off the profit from that.
Yeah, by selling it to our enemies.
nothing personal.
it's just business.
get down!
is it personal now, Soto?
this guy's dead.
that bullet was meant for you.
the shots were fired from over there.
I've got a . 308 casing.
this didn't come from the vaporizer.
you know what's weird?
I don't see any of your bullet strikes here.
Yeah, I tried to get a bead on the shooters, but...
by the time I did, they took off.
you know whatever is said between us stays between us, right?
did you freeze?
no, I didn't.
it's just when the, uh... when he started shooting, it took me back to that day.
I, uh... I felt like I was getting shot all over again.
well, why don't we just focus on the here and now?
we've got a shooter to catch.
you know, it looks like there are more casings up there.
concealment. Higher position.
it's where I'd want to be.
I'll check it out.
you find the casings?
Yeah. Three.
the shooter found himself a nice perch up here, but he wasn't too careful getting down.
really! Did you get a print?
sure did. Just one, but...
one's enough, right?
how do you know I took the shot?
we recovered your fingerprints from the sniper perch, Patrick.
soto was a sanctioned target.
as you know, I'm shielded from prosecution under the PATRIOT Act.
I'd hate to rain on your parade, my friend, but Soto, as it turns out, was not the victim.
you killed an innocent man.
so, currently, you're not shielded by anything.
intel said Soto was there.
he was.
you killed an innocent man.
why did they want him dead?
so Soto's buyer would deal directly with us.
we mobilized in the warehouse.
okay, let me rephrase it. Where is the gun?
where is it right now?
we removed the asset from the SUV the moment we knew Lancaster was down.
where is the location of the sale?
I don't question my superiors.
I get my orders, I act on them.
I believe in the cause, lieutenant, that we're defenders of liberty, overseas and at home.
wherever good soldiers are needed, that's where we are. - So be a good soldier, Patrick.
be a good soldier and get me the location of the sale. Where is it?
I don't know.
if you don't give me the location, innocent people are gonna die.
look at me. Look at me. - I don't know.
innocent people are gonna die.
and I know that you don't want that to happen, do you? - I don't know. Only Butler knows.
that's not who you are.
only Butler knows.
then give me Butler.
all I can give you is his computer.
do that.
have you seen this weapon used in the field?
on several targets... completely vaporize a human.
most beautiful thing to behold.
you said we'd be left alone.
this'll just give me a chance to demonstrate what the vaporizer can do.
all right, let's go. I'll finish it off.
get the ammo on the plane.
and that's with only half the barrels engaged.
you're on the losing side of this one, lieutenant.
I could fire a thousand rounds before you get a shot off...
well, apparently... ...it only takes the one.
Hey, Ken, how goes it?
it goes, Wolfe.
it'd be better if I hadn't start my morning seeing that woman in there.
Hey.
it looks like someone was thrown through the coffee table.
Yeah.
looks like there was a wine glass on the table, huh?
its stem punctured right through to her carotid artery.
this amount of blood, I'd be willing to bet she died of exsanguination.
so I'm guessing somebody grabbed her, pushed her.
we might not have a murder weapon.
Hey, Ryan, will you help me move her over just...?
alexx, hold on one second.
just, uh, don't touch her.
don't put your hands on her.
I'm thinking of trying something.
what are you thinking?
you gonna fume this body for prints, aren't you?
right here.
well, you know, I could dust the whole room and get a list of suspects who...maybe were in here.
but what I need is a suspect who made physical contact with her.
don't give me the hard sell, Wolfe.
just do what you gotta do before I whisk her away.
thank you, Alexx.
not bad for a makeshift fuming chamber.
I've popped a few tents in my day.
Oh, crap!
I'll go get a fire extinguisher, all right?
hurry, Ryan, those glue fumes are flammable!
Hey, this place is full of ammonia!
we got to get out of here! Let's go!
we got to get out of here! Let's go!
you two okay?
we're both a little crispy around the edges, but yeah, we're all right.
you know, I gotta tell you, I don't know what happened.
that fuming tent was fine when I checked it.
okay, get yourself checked out.
I need you at full strength.
you know, I hate to ask, but what about the body and the evidence?
the evidence will never fail us.
this place smells like ammonia.
you know, Ryan and Alexx barely got out.
this could have been ugly.
the scene's all clear.
we got here before there was too much damage.
have you got any idea what caused it?
Yeah, it was a fully operational meth lab.
this place was a ticking time bomb.
can we get inside?
sure, we got it under control. It's all yours now.
Thanks.
there's our fuming tent.
it's melted directly onto her.
well, there's the lab stuff.
looks like she took second, maybe third-degree burns.
so much for trace.
I don't know.
she was partially protected.
it doesn't look like the open flames breached her backside.
think we still may have a chance?
until we try.
if she was a meth cook, I'm not sure I have a whole lot of sympathy.
I don't think we know what she is at this point.
you got something else?
Yeah, Ryan's fuming tent didn't start this fire.
what do you think it was?
well, look at the char on the wall socket.
it's cooked.
I think that's why the fan shorted out.
I'll call Delko.
get him on it.
the circuit breakers are all taped open.
hmm, so when the power overloaded, the breakers couldn't throw.
the electrical couldn't turn itself off.
I wonder if this is some sort of an insurance scam.
owner knew he had bad tenants, wanted to kill two birds with one stone?
possibly.
all right, let's see who geI'll call H.
so you're the one who torched my condo?
sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Broyles, but it was actually nothing like that.
tell it to my attorney.
the girl that we found in the torched condo's name is Rachel Hemming, Mr. Broyles.
my God, it was her.
I can't believe it.
so she lived in your rental?
Yeah, she was a model tenant.
and living in a converted meth lab.
did you give her a break on the rent or jusstiff-arm her?
found a lot of glassware in there.
enough to make a pound a week.
that's a, that's pretty big business.
you overloaded the circuit breaker to make your drugs, and she was collateral damage.
did you tamper with the electcal system to deal with the power overload?
I don't know what to tell you guys.
the girl paid her rent on time, so I respected her privacy.
what, you gonna bust me for not being more nosy?
actually, it's called "criminal homicide.
nting one, two, three drug-related priors here.
that was her apartment.
those days are behind me.
apparent not.
turn right back around, honey.
you gonna have to give me more time.
I mean, I haven't even hada chance to
that's perfect'cause I wanted to catch you before you started.
okay, what's up?
I usually usn't see you guys down here with a kit.
I wanted to see if the fuming tent had a chance to do its job before it went up.
well, there wasn't a whole lot the fire didn't touch.
maybe a patch of skin that came in contact with the floor.
all right, we'll start there.
let me move her, all right?
you got it?
got it.
back this end up just a little bit.
okay.
we got a partial print.
Really?
looks like the fumes did their job after all.
cool.
okay.
Hey, Eric, what do you think that is?
that looks like a piece of plastic.
think it's part of her clothing?
looks like she wore it underneath her clothing, and whatever it was, the fire melted it into her skin.
I have no idea what this is.
you guys are gonna have to figure this one out.
well, it's hidden in the last place that someone would look.
if you ask me, I think it's a wire.
a wire?
so why was our baby girl bugged?
maybe whoever left that print knows.
No!
I rushed in soon as I got the phone call.
I'm not from the area.
Rachel's my sister.
what, you need me to sign for her or something?
post bail?
What'd she do this time?
well, I was hoping that you could tell me.
your sister was killed this morning.
are you sure?
Yeah.
I can't believe this is happening.
what am I gonna tell our parents?
well, how about the truth?
that's what I'm looking for.
Zach, we found your print on Rachel's body.
I'd never hurt her.
we have you in our system for assault.
Yeah, but that was for stupid college stuff.
the two of you have a fight?
not a "fight" fight. It wasn't...
look, Rachel hasn't had an easy life.
she got in with the wrong crowd.
our parents got her into rehab.
she ran away?
Yeah.
three months ago.
I came down from Ohio.
I finally found her and I tried to get her to come home.
Rachel. - Zach, what are you doing here?
I'm not leaving without you.
no, just leave.
you're coming with me.
No!
is that how she fell?
she didn't fall.
she's tougher than that.
she slapped me.
told me to get lost and...that's what I did.
so you're saying that you came all the way down here from Ohio to bringour sister back, she told you to leave and you left?
what else could I do?
well, I think we both know what.
look, you're looking at the wrong guy here.
I didn't come to Miami to kill anyone.
if you did,
Hey, what you got?
well, there's nothing on the wine glass s that punctured her neck, but...
that piece of metal Alexx found on Rachel Hemming's body...
it's a recording device.
Really?
well, maybe if the memory card's still intact, we could hear who killed her.
Yeah, dream on. It's just a transmitter.
now we'll be stuck trying to figure out who it transmits to.
and it's a pretty tall order.
always is.
but... think I got some kind of serial number here on the power source.
let's take a closer look.
group Three.
well, MFO stands for Miami Field Office.
Miami's got the most field offices of any law enforcement agency in the country.
trying to find the right one, you want to talk about a tall order?
let's see.
that's the number.
I'm gonna put it in the database, see if we get lucky.
I don't think you have to.
I actually know this office code.
how's that?
I used to work there.
lieutenant, Mike Farallon. - Mike - Natalia. - Hey.
have to admit it's strange having you back in these offices.
I know.
she was one of the best. - Thanks.
I agree.
why don't we go somewhere a little more private?
so how can I help you?
Mike, we're here to talk about Rachel Hemming.
we spoke to your ASAC.
and we know that she was your confidential informant, Mike.
she was, yes.
I just heard.
it's a big loss for us.
she was your find?
Yeah, about three months ago I picked her up for possession with intent to distribute.
I could tell she wasn't a user, so instead of locking her up,
I put her inside a meth operation we were tracking.
30 grams, Rachel.
that's a felony possession with intent to distribute.
you're looking at seven years in a federal penitentiary.
you said you could get me out of it.
that's right.
I can make this whole thing disappear into the ether.
what do I have to do?
keep dealing.
Rachel's intel was taking us directly to the operation's leadership.
what do you think happened to her?
I was supposed to meet her at a warehouse downtown to get a report, but...
she never showed.
what about the surveillance audio?
she was wired.
it's the first thing I checked.
unfortunately, the bug wasn't transmitting.
why do you think that happened?
um, I'm sorry, this is as far as I can go.
this is still an open investigation.
so is her murder, Mike.
so is her murder.
so, Ryan torches this condo and he's not here helping us sift through this because...
Oh, come on, Eric, that wasn't his fault.
Yeah, well, it would've been nice of him to at least offer a little help.
Calleigh, you needed to see me?
Yes. I was wondering if you would take those four cans of glass that we got from the crime scene and run them through DNA.
every piece?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're gonna need it ASAP, okay?
sure, and while I'm at it, I'll find a way to end global warming and finish that proof of the unified field theory I've been working on.
would it be inappropriate if I asked you right now if it was going to take you more than an hour?
I know I'm a miracle worker, but there is a lot of work to be miracled here.
but I will get on it.
I'll send someone over to collect the rest of the stuff as you go through it.
thank you, Maxine.
all right, what have you got next?
a picture of Rachel Hemming.
but who's the guy in it?
I don't know. They look awfully friendly.
boyfriend, ex-boyfriend, maybe.
whoever it is, I'm sure it's someone we're gonna want to talk to.
well, if you do that, you're gonna have to pull his mug out of all that damage.
check it out, there's some writing on the back.
can't make it out.
well, maybe Ryan will make himself useful in QD.
well, I will deliver it to him personally.
Hey. - Hey.
just came in to get a peek at the picture that Calleigh keeps talking about.
Yeah, I uploaded a digital version into the image editor software to recover what damage was done.
does it one pixel at a time.
thousands of color combinations per second.
get an accurate representation of basically what we lost.
I know who that is.
who? - Mike.
who's Mike? - Mike Farallon. FBI.
Really?
well, you're gonna love this.
you know, the handwriting that was on the back of the photo?
well, the ink's pigment was gone.
but the solvent was still on the paper.
could you get any of the words to pop?
after 380 nanometers of ultraviolet light...
you bet.
stay away or you'll get hurt.
well, that picture just became a threat.
Yeah, it looks like somebody's still playing the old jealousy card.
Yeah, well, at least I know where to start.
Mike, the FBI guy, right?
no. His wife.
is that your writing, Mrs. Farallon?
no.
we'll need a handwriting sample to confirm that.
what's this about?
my husband.
do you recognize the woman that's in the picture with him?
I've never seen her before.
her name's Rachel Hemming and she was murdered this morning.
what, you suspect Mike?
we're investigating all the angles.
Mike and I married young.
we made, uh...adjustments.
Mike's an undercover agent.
he's forced to live in two worlds, so...
we have an understanding.
and what is that?
what he does when he's out of the house is his business.
he keeps a roof over our heads, our kids go to good schools, and, uh, when he comes home... he belongs to me.
you make that sound so simple.
it's anything but.
can you account for your whereabouts in the last 24 hours?
I was home with my family.
and you can prove that?
check it out for yourself.
thanks for coming in.
she has an alibi, so I'm gonna go check it out.
there's something wrong, Ms. Boa Vista.
well, evidently, the Farallons have a marriage of convenience and she just...
tolerates the infidelity.
so he has a history.
three years ago when I was working with Mike at the bureau,
I found out that he was sleeping with an informant and I confronted him.
and he asked me to keep it quiet.
and what did you do?
I did.
now I wish I'd had the guts to tell the bureau.
are you willing to do that now?
Yeah, I am.
the original informant, are we in touch with her?
can be.
bring her in.
how you been? - Good.
you know I didn't bring you in here to chat about the lat few years, right?
so, I'm guessing this is about Mikey.
Yeah.
agent Farallon.
did you know he had a new C. I?
hell, yeah.
told me he needed a fresh face to stay ahead of the bad guys.
so he cut me loose, and brought in this cute little number to replace me.
I'm guessing that bothered you.
Mikey and I spent a lot of time together.
I was his eyes and ears.
I made nice with some of...
the craziest meth dealers in Miami
all for him.
I did everything he asked me to do.
I know you did.
everything.
the more I risked my life for him, the more he had to rush in to save me.
I thought he and I had something.
so you paid a little visit to Rachel Hemming?
Yeah. I did.
I wanted her to know that she was only temporary.
Mikey doesn't care about you.
what? Who are you?
I'm your mirror to the past.
three months ago, I was you.
it's not like that at all.
Really?
are you sure about that?
it's a copy-- for you.
the original's for his wife.
why are you doing this to me?
it's for your own good.
Mikey is a piece of work.
I bet he gave her the same, um...
safe word that he gave me.
together.
and what is that-what's "together," what does it mean?
for when you're in danger.
you say the word, and then Agent Mike can burst in and save the day.
like in one of those romance novels.
I cannot believe that I fell for that.
can I go?
you had physical contact with a murder victim, so until we figure out how this whole story's going to end,
I need you to stay close.
all right.
you talked to Jane?
she's obsessed. How could you give what she says any credence?
that's the thing about a C. I. you have to believe what they say or they're useless.
then we confirm with hard data.
I was not sleeping with Rachel Hemming.
I'm married, B.V.
you know, there's a real problem when the informant is more reliable than you are.
how deep did you get with Rachel?
depends who you ask.
she's dead, and you're the only one left.
what are you implying?
just what everybody else is thinking, Mike -
that she had more of your secrets than anyone else's.
you know me, Natalia.
Rachel was too critical to our objective.
you know, work has always come first.
I really hope that's true, Mike.
cause, you know, you're running out of time and excuses.
Hey...Alexx, what are you doing up here?
I'm afraid it's not good news.
what is it?
I found more than glass in Rachel Hemming's body.
there was a fetus.
she was pregnant.
Yeah, about ten to 12 weeks along.
who's the father?
DNA's working on it right now.
one death just became two.
catch this monster, Calleigh.
catch this one.
Hey, is Valera still working on that glass from the Rachel Hemming's case?
Yeah, but she's pretty swamped.
so I thought I'd jump in and lend a hand.
okay,'cause I just ran into Alexx in the hall.
she told me Rachel was pregnant.
we should rush that fetus tissue
Yeah.
I'm running that sample for a familial match right now through CODIS.
and then I'm going to compare it to Mike Farallon's file.
his track record with his confidential informants is questionable... at best.
I'm just hoping that he didn't make another mistake.
for his sake.
look at that, it's not Mike.
but it does match another elimination sample.
Zach Hemming.
her brother?
Zach, why was Rachel pregnant with your baby?
she's your sister.
stepsister.
by marriage only.
her father, my mom-- we weren't related.
but you have the same name.
no, we don't.
Rachel's last name is Desmond.
when she came to Miami, she used my father's name to hide out.
and that's what you used to track her down?
Yeah.
look, we were 18 when our parents got married.
we lived in the same house-- a room apart.
things just... sort of happened.
we tried to cut things off, but then she got pregnant.
and you
she was afraid of...
what our parents might think, so that's why she left.
I went after her so she didn't have to face it alone.
you can't live like this, Rachel.
you can't raise a kid like this.
I have someone else, Zach.
someone to take care of me and the baby.
just go.
go home, Zach!
it took me three months to find her.
I was so frustrated.
she left me powerless.
how frustrating?
did you kill her?
I know I don't have enough money to support a family, but it would have been better than the life she was living.
I saw the drugs.
she needed help.
Zach... - No, I didn't... I didn't hurt her.
even if I couldn't be part of their life...
I would never hurt her.
lieutenant Caine?
you have a moment?
of course I do, Glen.
you questioned one of my agents today. Mike Farallon.
we're investigating the murder of one of your informants.
I'd like to ask you to back off of Agent Farallon.
he's hiding something.
that's his job, Lieutenant.
we were four hours from a major drug bust this morning.
till Rachel Hemming's murder got in the way.
agent Farallon, the Bureau, is hanging but a thread on this one.
we cannot afford to overreact.
was he recording surveillance at the time of her death, Glen?
I have no idea what you're getting at, but whether he was or not, I have no reason to doubt him.
are you aware they were having an affair?
the Bureau is willing to forgive any of Farallon's transgressions if it means bringing down the largest organized meth operation in South Florida.
I'm going to need the name of her target.
no chance, Lieutenant.
you'll know who he is when we make the arrest.
and as for Agent Farallon...
I need you to back off until we make those arsts.
Hey, Glen...
if I find out that he got this girl killed, I'm going to get him.
so
let me guess-- they all match the victim.
Yeah. Rachel Hemming lost a lot of blood.
needle in a haystack.
TheVictim, victim...
this one's XY.
that's male. That's not our victim.
guess there was a needle after all.
let me run it against our reference samples.
Jeremy Broyles?
that's Rachel's landlord.
H, listen, I think you're got to want to revisit one of our suspects.
Broyles owns the whole building.
I've got all entrances and exits blocked off. - okay
lieutenant, over here.
bingo, Frank.
here we go.
you smell that, Frank?
Yeah. Meth lab.
Miami-Dade PD.
can I help you? - Is your landlord here?
no, sorry...
you've got the wrong guy.
get down on the ground, Jeremy.
you've got the wrong guy, man.
Jeremy, get down on the ground.
you got the wrong guy, man.
we found your blood in Rachel Hemming's apartment.
I'm the landlord.
I'm in these units all the time making repairs.
you're under arrest for murder.
hook him up.
I got something.
a piece of glass.
Conchoidial fracture, bevel surface.
same as the victim's coffee table.
I don't know how that got there.
have a seat here, please.
so we got you at the crime scene. Right?
we have the crime scene on you.
I don't think things could be any more clear.
let me clarify something else for you.
that bitch deserved what she got.
in my business...
loyalty is everything.
something seemed off about her.
then it hit me.
she never, not once, tested our product.
somebody got to you.
what? A cop?
we're together on this.
you hear me?
together.
okay.
then we share this.
come on, Jeremy, not today.
why not, baby?
why won't you take a hit?
we've got that deal later. I just want to keep a clear head.
you're lying to me, baby. - No.
Yes, you are. You're a narc, aren't you? - No! You don't understand!
No! Do not!
didn't anybody ever teach her the rules of the game?
blend in.
she takes the hit...
she lives to see another day.
you know what was off about her?
what?
she was pregnant.
so not only, Jeremy, did you kill a new mother...
you killed her unborn child.
live with that.
Oh, Miss Boa Vista.
I understand you closed the Rachel Hemming case.
we did. We arrested Jeremy Broyles for her murder.
Why? Are you here to tell us that we screwed up your investigation?
hardly.
turns out you guys chopped off the head of the snake.
we got panicked meth dealers looking for new product.
fish in a barrel.
that's great. Is that for us?
Oh, yeah.
I pulled all the audio files off Agent Farallon's computer.
anything of interest?
I haven't had a chance to hear it, but now that you got Broyles for murder, it's probably a moot point anyway.
maybe not.
what do you mean?
want to come with me?
sure.
so this is all of Agent Farallon's files?
everything that Rachel Hemming's wire picked up while she was his CI on the Broyles case.
it all pertains to our drug op.
what do you need?
that.
that proves that Farallon lied.
what are you talking about?
well, he said that he didn't get any transmission from Rachel this morning.
well, no, she died before he got the chance.
then explain this last date.
december 17, 9:38 a. m.
that was this morning.
right before she was murdered.
Jeremy, hey. Didn't expect you this early. What's up?
my guys tell me you've been asking questions.
questions? About what?
everything. Stuff you don't need to know.
paranoid much, Jeremy?
you should lay off your own tweak.
somebody got to you.
what? A cop?
we're together on this.
you hear me?
together.
things were about to go sideways. Why would he stop recording?
he knew her real well.
she's done this before. Maybe he didn't sense a threat.
no, no. He knew that there was a threat because she said the word "together.
together? - That was their safe word.
that was the same safe word he used with his last C. I.Jane Duncroft.
if that was the safe word, he should have helped her.
Yeah, he should have.
but I think he wanted her dead.
what's this about?
I've run hundreds of interrogations.
you think I don't know that stare?
just cut to the chase.
I'll do th-- you sat back and did nothing while your confidential informant was murdered.
how does that grab you?
listen up.
both of you.
I'm here as a courtesy, okay?
so don't think for a second that I'm gonna put up with your penny-ante local PD nonsense, okay?
you guys are way out of your league, here, man.
is that a fact?
we have the tape from this morning.
Rachel was a great C. I.
all her work was about to pay off.
Ourwork.
I had no idea Broyles was onto her.
she did, and that's why she tried to contact you.
you sat there. You listened.
she said the safe word and you did nothing.
all to cover up your affair.
I... figured when the case was over, so were we.
I'd let her go and that'd be that.
Yeah, and then she told you she was pregnant.
listen, my wife... my, my job...
if that got out, I would have lost everything.
Jeremy, hey. Didn't expect you this early. What's up?
my guys tell me you've been asking questions.
questions? About what?
everything. Stuff you don't need to know.
paranoid much, Jeremy?
you should lay off your own tweak.
somebody got to you.
what? A cop?
we're together on this.
you hear me? Together.
and in that moment, I saw my life in fast-forward.
I knew how everything would play out.
not everything.
she may have been pregnant, but it wasn't your child.
what?
that's not true.
that istrue, Agent, and DNA has confirmed it.
you were so busy with your investigation you forgot that she was a human being.
They...were human beings.
not bad, for a couple of penny-ante locals, huh?
why don't I feel better about this?
you took a dangerous man off thstreet.
should have done it three years ago.
sometimes it takes that long.
tell that to Rachel Hemming.
you know... there's a way you could honor her life.
how is that?
forgive yourself.
you've earned it, Natalia.
take it.
you go voluntarily, you wave your right to fight extradition.
it's not going to make a difference, rick.
rio de Janeiro Brazil
so what happens now?
it's very simple.
as far as I'm concerned...
you are free to go.
this is mala noche justice
como?
como?
mala noche justice...
meet miami justice.
you made it.
Yeah, but a lot of people didn'T.
what's going on?
Calleigh was abducted while following a lead on the newberry case.
searched for her all night.
finally tracked her gps, we were unable to locate her.
okay.
Yeah, I'm with h right now.
that's tripp.
they found calleigh's hummer.
we got to find her.
aerial unit spotted it.
no sign of calleigh. No eyewitnesses either.
we'll be right down.
cell phone and her kit are still in the car.
whoever did this was smart enough to disable the gps tracking unit.
this is too damaged for ibis, eric.
Yeah. Yeah, well, shot came through the window, so, there's probably a cleaner bullet inside the car.
gentlemen, I don't see any skid marks, do you?
that means she slowed to a stop before the gunfire.
it also means this was an ambush.
this just isn't sitting with me.
Calleigh was armed. We all know she wouldn't go down without a fight.
What'd you get, eric?
got some sort of reflective trace.
let's get that to the lab and I'll catch up to you gentlemen later.
what the hell u think happened in brazil?
he didn't say.
I'm just glad he's back.
Hey, any luck with the trace found outside calleigh' s hummer?
I wouldn't call it luck.
call it chloroform.
no wonder she didn't put up a fight.
do you think that it's any coincidence that kathleen newberry was also subdued with chloroform?
I don't think that we can afford any coincidences.
every minute that calleigh's missing, her odds get worse.
then I think we should speak to newberry's suspected killer, ron saris.
Horatio's already on it.
you chloroformed kathleen newberry and then killed her.
Horatio, as I told you before you were arrested for murder in brazil, uh, there's no evidence to prove that.
one of my csi's was chloroformed and abducted last night.
and I see that as a pattern, ron.
thousands of people can get their hands on chloroform.
Yes.
but I'm only looking for one.
well, I'm happy for you, but I know you can't hold me so, I'm, uh...
I... I want to thank you. For brazil.
um... worked out really well for the two of us, didn't it?
because, uh, julia and I, we got back together.
best of luck finding your csi.
if anything happens to my csi, this'll be your last week on earth.
pick her up.
what do you want from me?
we want to "solve a crime with calleigh.
see, our poker buddy, robert, he, uh, hmm...
he didn't give us what we wanted.
so he had to pay the price.
and then, tommy found your website.
look, you're a csi, right?
make it so this can't be traced back to us.
you expect me to cover up a murder?
okay. Okay.
uh, let me think.
you need gloves.
and we got to bleach the floor.
wipe up all the surfaces for fingerprints, for shoe prints, for any skin trace.
what else?
I need to get the bullet out of the body.
they could trace it back to your gun.
but you're going to have to untie me for that.
you're lucky. This bullet's near the surface.
stop.
where do you think you're going?
I need to get something to get the bullet out with.
get rid of that.
good.
you think you can get the next bullet out on your own?
yeah?
what do we need her for?
I wouldn't do that.
why is that?
that bullet smells like garlic.
what the hell does that mean?
it means I need you to get me some toilet cleaner, a lint roller, speaker wire and a black light.
Yeah, we'll get right on that.
you know, you should stop stalling.
just trying to do what you asked me to do.
look, I think we should see what she can do.
okay.
you can be her delivery boy.
it'll give me a chance to get to know this bitch one on one.
go.
I'd smoke that cigar.
Yeah, I was planning to afterwards.
but... if that's what turns you on, then...
the smell of the cigar will mask the smell of decomp.
yeah?
unless, of course, you want your neighbors calling the cops down here.
you're not as stupid as you look.
can we have a minute, son?
um, take these with you.
go ahead, sweetie, andI'll see you in a second.
I guess you weren't expecting to see me again, huh?
no.
but horatio, I didn't want you to die.
I thought you'd have a better chance in brazil than here against ron saris.
so I take it that's his dry ngeanicl?
he's living with us now.
whatever ron is or isn'T... - he's a killer.
he got me my son back.
Yes, but he killed kathleen newberry to do it.
I had nothing to do with that.
the one witness who saw what kyle did is gone.
can't you just let this go?
one of my csis is missing.
and you think ron had something to do with it?
it was a roadside abduction, that's his signature.
Oh, my god.
if you stay with this man, you and kyle are going to die.
pick it up.
Tommy's out there running errands, I thought that maybe...
me and you could waste a little time.
I'd rather die than have you touch me.
last words.
let's hear them. Huh?
I don't think you killed the poker player.
took you long enough.
not like there's a store that sells everything on earth, seth.
I need the toilet cleaner and the stereo wire.
would you hand me one of those mugs and a corkscrew, please?
what are you doing?
it's called the reinsch test.
I take some of his tissue and I put it into a solution of hydrochloric acid.
and the acid will separate the inorganic from the organic molecules.
it's basic chemistry.
then I put the copper wire in and see if it turns gray.
it's gray, so what?
it's positive for the presence of heavy metal.
from the bullet when we shot him.
no, it's a different kind of metal.
um, mercury, thallium, selenium -
the atoms from one of those metals will bind to the copper and turn it gray.
I would say you're looking at...acute arsenic poisoning.
wait, wait. So you're saying that we could be off the hook?
she's saying that somebody killed him before we shot him.
what's the black light for?
it's for our next location.
I can tell that this is not the primary crime scene.
no, no, no-- we're not taking you anywhere.
you just told us he was poisoned.
the bullet wound is perimortem.
ultimately, it's up to the medical examiner, but the police could still charge you with attempted murder, which is 25 years to life.
if you make a sound, if you even think about running,
I promise you, I will not hesitate.
you're not allowed in here.
it's about calleigh.
she's still missing, right? - Yeah, she's still missing.
she's been abducted, coop.
now, what do you want?
it's the memory card from the first kidnap victim, kathleen newberry.
I thought it might help you find her.
Yeah, I hope so.
there are a lot of similarities between the newberry case and calleigh'S.
chloroform, both kidnapped from public places...
Yeah, and ron saris doesn't have an alibi for either one.
if we could just get that guy for murder, maybe we could get him to tell us who he's working with.
I won't let calleigh end up like that other woman.
what's that? What is that line?
well, I'm not sure. Let's take a closer look.
some kind of a string?
that wasn't on the car when we looked at it in our garage.
maybe it fell off in transit.
Yeah, it's not like these tow truck drivers look for evidence.
you gotta be fair, though. They're paid to tow, not solve our cases.
all I'm saying is that if they would've tried a little harder, then maybe calleigh wouldn't be missing right now.
I know what you're saying. I'm just saying that we could play "what if" all day.
the important thing is finding her, right?
Yeah.
Ryan, yeah, I need you to stop by the tow yard.
excuse me, sir?
sir!
sir, could you do me a favor and take a break?
sir, please?
could you do me a favor and stop, please?
may I help you?
you could help me by taking a little bit of a break.
Thanks, man.
bingo.
that's a match, ron, a perfect match.
which places you at the scene.
correction. Uh, it puts a dirty piece of string under a car that you pulled from a lake.
I think that after you pushed her car into the water, you caught your shoe under her bumper.
all right.
you know, I'm not gonna talk anymore.
conspiracy to kidnap a law enforcement officer carries a life sentence.
why, horatio, would I bother with a csi?
why would I do that when I've got what I needed?
I've got julia back.
and we both know how that happened. Don't we?
by killing the newberry lady?
okay, you're never going to prove that.
never.
I just did.
not after I talk to the state attorney and tell them that you coerced evidence unlawfully.
assault and battery.
you beat me up to get what you needed.
you stole my shoelace.
nice try, ron.
well, that bruise should show up about the same time as the state attorney,
I would say, don't you?
now, horatio, tell me.
are they gonna believe me, or are they gonna blame a cop who got extradited to brazil for killing a man?
just remember what I said, ron.
I will.
I'm going to go to julia now.
Oh, I'll say hi to your son for you.
do that.
Ouch.
you know, unless the bullet ricocheted, it's probably on the passenger side.
well, I haven't found anything yet.
well, maybe the window shattered when the bullet hit the door.
hand me a screwdriver.
Yeah, what do you need it for?
got a crack in the door panel.
aren't we looking for a bullet hole?
we are, but sometimes this rigid plastic -
it does funny things when it's hit by a bullet.
it'll crack open and snaps back shut like a swinging door.
I don't even have that gun anymore.
well, if you sold it, where's the rece there is no receipt.
I lost it in a poker game last night.
what, nobody could change a hundred?
I've lost my watch, my boat, maxed-out my visa.
the gun was all I had on me.
didn't change the cards, though.
who'd you lose it to?
like I know his real name.
well, no legal casino is gonna allow you to bet with a gun.
sounds like an underground game to me.
Yeah, so?
so one of our own csis has been abducted with that gun.
you need to tell us where the game was played.
we've already got you on illegal gambling, sport.
it's time to show your cards.
it was an old factory building.
I think it was 1429 wimberly.
you better hope you're right.
H, yeah, we got an address.
got a body, eric.
it's not calleigh.
it smells like bleach.
well, his fingernails have been scraped.
body is positioned.
clothes pulled in a single direction.
someone took a lint roller to him, d movereany trace.
the body's been cleaned.
this whole room has.
professionally, which is why they grabbed calleigh-- to cover this murder.
what have you got?
I've got some prints.
got a lot of prints, H.
it's a number 60.
60 is a police code for a two-man unit.
she's leaving us a message, eric.
she's telling us she was taken by two men, which means she was alive when she left this room.
Yeah, but for how long?
that's going to be priority number one, gentlemen.
excuse me.
Hey. What the hell's going on?
and you are?
I'm mitch davis. I own the buil ng.
I have plans to turn this place into lofts.
nobody's supposed to be in there.
well, somebody was, Mr. Davis, and now they're on the way to the coroner's office.
you people really need to step up the patrols around here.
I am not in the business of providing room and board to a bunch of squatters.
a man was shot and killed and found next to a poker table.
does that ring a bell?
a poker table?
first murder, now illegal gambling. Well, th-that's great.
so what am I supposed to do-- build a moat?
why don't you start with security cameras?
now you can see our cleaning job.
I'm gonna need the black light.
what do you need that for?
show you what you missed.
this is where robert was shot.
what the hell, man?!
I thought you said you cleaned it. - I did, I swear.
his wound was in the abdomen, and based on the amount of blood here,
I would say that he landed face down.
y-you're right.
we just wanted to ask him where the next poker tournament was going to be.
so you guys like to gamble?
no, we like the entry fee.
tonight's the big one.
ten guys with 100 k buy-in each.
so you were planning a robbery. And what?
robert got in the way?
look, no, we thought he was our in.
we used to play nickel ante games down at the marina.
he liked it.
when we asked him for the address, he, like, freaked out.
I told you.
I don't know where.
just give us the address.
this tournament isn't for you.
toss a few more cards and come back in a couple years.
I thought he was trying to make a move on us.
was robert using this flask?
Yeah.
if he was poisoned, we might be able to get something off of it.
go to the medicine cabinet, see if you can find some iodine.
Why?
you'll see.
stop!
what are you trying to do?
start a fire, get the cops here?
look, this is called a fuming chamber.
the smoke is supposed to be there.
the hot chemical is going to stick to any print that's on the flask.
I've got two prints.
okay, if you give me yours, I can exclude you.
do I look stupid to you?
you just want our prints so that your friends can pick us up later.
you know what, if you don't trust me now, you're never going to.
I don't trust cops.
you can have my prints.
I trust you.
look, I don't know what he's been telling you, but this is not going to end well.
we're already in too deep. We have no other choice.
no, that is not true.
if you take the flask to the police, give it to them, it will point them in a totally different direction.
you've got to turn yourself in.
I'm telling you it is the only way.
I don't know.
I do. You are not the same person that he is.
just find a way to get out of here, any way you can.
what kind of excuse? I don't know what to say.
I'll give you one.
what are you two talking about?
we're going to need bleach soon.
you're up, delivery boy.
so, alexx, this is our poker player.
Yeah, horatio, but there's no id yet.
and something weird-- his heart showed signs of cardiac arrest.
he had a heart attack?
Yes.
so I sent some samples to tox.
turns out it was caused by acute arsenic toxicity.
so the poisoning caused the heart attack.
there was also significant postmortem tearing around the wound, as if someone had gone digging.
and look at this, horatio.
from weird to weirder.
alexx, that's a piece of a cigar.
okay, you're saying that as if it makes perfect sense.
inside the layering of that tobacco could be dna.
I'm gonna take that with me.
so you're saying that calleigh left this in the wound tract for us to find?
I am.
pick it up.
will you hand me one of those mugs and a corkscrew, please?
Seth mcadams, attempted rape.
here we go.
I had units roll out to seth mcadams' last known.
what did we learn, frank?
he hasn't been seen in days.
no sign of the guy.
