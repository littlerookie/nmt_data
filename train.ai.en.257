hiv also played its part.
hiv and aids has decimated the world we live in, and things are only going to get worse.so it is called "super killer."
hiv can be transmitted in the sexual fluids, blood or breast milk of an infected person.

hiv infection in this country has historically been associated with homosexuality and intravenous drug use, among other causes.
hiv is a medical condition, so it's personal, private health information.
hiv is a vulnerable virus that dies soon afte r it leaves the human body.
hiv is efficiently (and tragically) spread via breast milk, so we know that swallowing hiv-infected fluid can result in infection.
hiv is not transmitted through everyday social contact.
hiv is overwhelmingly transmitted through sexual contact, through intravenous drug use, through infected blood donations and from mother to child during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding.
