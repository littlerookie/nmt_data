what? No. Who told you to get my cell phone number?
Oh, just relax. Don't be paranoid.
in case I obtain any helpful information from the victim's remains back in D. C.
what exactly do you expect to find from a cracked-up bag of old bones?
look, Bones has her thing, just like Walter here, all right?
except my thing is real, not some imaginary finder power.
he's upset that you said his finder power isn't real.
tell me what you lost and I'll find it.
I haven't lost anything.
everybody's lost something.
bones... Okay.
tell him... Tell him about that thing that you won that you lost.
just tell him.
in seventh grade, I won first place in my school science fair.
I lost the medal.
I went to... - That's all I need.
um, do you guys want Ike to fly you back to D. C?
she can have you there in a couple hours.
she's your bartender and your pilot?
what's with the sudden interest in Ike?
you know what? We're gonna fly commercial.
so why don't you just go back inside and find yourself a necktie, all right?
come on, Bones. Let's go. Chop-chop. Come on. Gotta go.
fly commercial, they know where you're at at all times.
you get any kind of vibe of Pudge's place, Ike?
500 square feet, one bedroom, one bath, crap neighborhood, 600 bucks a month, max.
pudge pulled down $375 a week.
guy was totally living within his means.
you're saying he wasn't any kind of master thief.
total novice.
tell you what: somebody hired him to steal that map.
well, no hidden key.
break and enter?
I'm your legal advisor, not your accomplice.
miss you already.
he's not crazy.
where I come from, we call Walter's gift "Darna Shealladh," the second sight.
Yeah, right.'Cause, uh, you're from Scotland.
you ever think that maybe that's why you and me were put with Walter?
to make sure that never happens?
we both owe the man our lives.
then thy shall walk in thy way safely.
you been in there long enough.
okay, story so far: Clinically depressed, no girlfriend, weight issues, mucho health problems.
recently sold all his belongings except for hundreds of man books.
adventure, porn, crime, spy, or how to kill grizzly bears with a spoon?
crime. Except for one.
no pets, no friends, no computer.
no wonder he was depressed.
no, he was depressed because he was dying.
in the video, the guy's drunk, but this house is drier than Saudi Arabia.
pudge reads too many tough-guy books imagines himself a hard-boiled crook, shows up at the meet all whiskied up for courage without the map.
demands more money, gets himself murdered.
Yup.
his place get tossed?
Nope. Clean as a nun's closet.
indicating Pudge told them where to find the map, most likely after torture.
otherwise, his place would be upside down and inside out.
who is this?
it's Dr. Brennan at the Jeffersonian.
don't you have caller ID?
caller ID doesn't tell you who's calling.
it tells you who the phone company wants you to think is calling.
Hey, did you guys find out that the victim was terminally ill?
Yes.
his mitral valve is completely calcified.
how did you know?
he had pyramids on the ceiling of his bedroom.
pyramids indicate heart disease?
of all the things humans created, pyramids stood the test of time best.
dying people invest all sorts of meaning in them.
so, uh, did you find any signs of torture?
Yes, I did.
three fingers were dislocated shortly before death.
it's possible, given his heart condition, that the victim died with his secret intact.
no, he told the killer where to find the map.
well, do you know where?
poor man's safety deposit box.
I-I don't know what that means.
pawnshop.
you got anything else?
no, I'm done.
well, me, too.
for each person who goes in, three come out, and none of them is carrying merchandise.
perfect setup for receiving stolen goods.
Frau Beckenbauer?
Guten Tag.
my name is Walter Sherman.
Oh, hello.
ich do Frau Becken who was Temperance Brennan's...?
Hey, Ike, how do you say "foster parent" in German?
what makes you think you're speaking German?
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
das in seventh grade science metal den?
impersonation with intent to defraud.
thank you very much.
totally understood me.
how strange that must be for you.
tortious malfeasance.
I'm a'risk it.
I'd like to redeem this item.
unless you issued a false ticket, it's a ukulele.
although you spelled ukulele wrong... too many E's and L's.
unless...
is that some kind of code?
law says that for 60 days, I can only redeem the item to the pawner, Mr. Sam Nozik, which is exactly whom you are not.
we can get a warrant if that's the route you prefer.
big ups for the Mod Squad impersonation, but no way you're cops.
although, I'm always up for handcuffs.
you know what? Come here.
recently, you had problems with the city, right?
plumbing, health, vermin.
definite twitch on "vermin.
they shut us down for a whole week.
right. Cops did that so they could install surveillance.
don't believe me, ask them.
those cheating bastards.
Oh, that's a shame, right there.
what happened to it?
girl smashed it to bits.
a girl?
I give you this insight in a spirit of cooperation.
the girlfriend who smashed it... what's her name?
$300?
that's one hell of a ukulele.
she maybe fished some piece of paper out of it before she vamoosed.
what else are you keeping from us?
don't take that tone with the lovely lady.
what else do we have to give in exchange?
I didn't get no name, but she had a tattoo across her chest.
do Not Resuscitate.
Walter, I told you when you found me a set of ivory irezumi tattoo needles from the Jomon period, anything you need, I'm your guy.
all I know, it's a girl.
do not resuscitate" across her chest.
across her chest.
daddy issues, self-loathing, possibly a lesbian.
what would be good is an actual name.
anyone know an Ellen with "Do not resuscitate" inked across her boobs?
no, man.
Why?
spider indicates drugs, color blue means meth.
Hey, are you in charge of meth distribution in all of Southern Florida or just this county?
as a peaceful man, I'm going to ask you politely to please let my friend go.
or what, you're gonna recite me a poem?
peace goes into the making of a poet as flour goes into the making of bread.
who the hell is that?
Oh, that's my legal advisor.
bartender's dealing Ecstasy, bikers get a cut of the pool tables, and they're running whores.
Yeah, I didn't bring you for your systems analysis.
well, why did you bring me here?
well, well. Do Not Resuscitate.
looks like the biker didn't lie to Leo.
Yeah, well, people never lie to Leo.
so, I ask you, why did you bring me here?
Oh, Rusty says she's lesbian.
I just need you to distract her.
how?
uh, buy her a drink.
uh, something suggestive like a... ooh, a Slippery Nipple.
I am not lesbian.
I just have a confident "demeanior.
all right.
oy, oy, have a look.
looks like Rusty got the ol' lesbian factor wrong.
Oh, this one's mine.
okay, how's my breath?
she smuggles meth to bikers.
she tortured the fat man till he died.
she doesn't give a toss about your breath.
Ah, I'm a'risk it.
okay, while I distract her, you break into her vehicle, and maybe we get lucky, find the stolen chart in the glove compartment.
Hey, you live on a boat?
you're like herpes... impossible to get rid of.
the Screw You? - My motto.
take it personal.
do Not Resuscitate, a boat: Screw You.
I got concerns about your self-esteem.
do you have any idea of the black market in organs?
that tattoo is like an open invitation to wake up in a bathtub, packed full of ice, no kidneys.
I'll look out for my organs, you look out for yours.
are we alone?
how do you mean?
I mean, is someone watching us?
you've got some kind of mental problems, am I right?
well, two tours in Iraq left me a little suspicious, but otherwise, I am a fully functioning male machine.
well, hooking up with loony tunes like you has left me a little suspicious.
tide's shifting now, so...
what is that? - I don't know.
well, I got to shove off, so sayonara, which is Chinese for "Get lost.
when can I see you again?
Walter, you're cute, but if today works out, you'll never see me again.
nobody will.
because I'll be gone.
I could find you.
in my experience, men don't try that hard.
I'm like a whole new experience.
once I start looking for you, I will find you.
why are you being so persistent?
I'm not that pretty.
that's a good-bye kiss, all right?
well, are you sure you don't want me to come with you now, just to be safe?
now, Walter, who the hell ever got anything worth getting by being safe?
the chart fragment's got to be on that boat.
I octopused her. I couldn't find the map anywhere on her person. How about you?
nothing in her truck. Not even a VIN number.
Ah, chop shop vehicle.
all stolen bits and pieces?
nice girl.
Yeah, a girl who kisses a guy to make him go away.
that's a nice form of rejection.
seriously, Walter?
can you imagine how blokes she's driven away with that mouth?
Britanny's got the original chart.
we'll get the next best thing.
Dr. Brennan.
Mr. Sherman.
what's this?
as promised.
you-you did it.
that's, uh... I was going to say "impossible,
but clearly, it's not impossible, but... I-I... I lost this.
are you impressed?
I'd like to impress you.
Why?
the usual reasons.
this... This is me and... my mom.
I... I'm ex... extremely grateful.
it's amazing how many times people ask me to find something, but...
...the real treasure's something else altogether.
did you come all this way just to bring me this?
Yes.
and to ask if you got somebody in this lab who can recreate the missing chart fragment from the museum's security footage.
Yes, yes, I,um... Angela Montenegro has been... working on that.
I will take you to her... ...to her office.
the security footage includes several dozen frames from slightly different angles, so... we should be able to get a pretty good image.
how accurate will this be?
who are you?
I'm her husband.
are you rich?
okay, where did that come from?
on a scale of one to ten, she's an 11.
well, thank you, Mr. Sherman.
Yeah, you're a seven.
so if you're rich it just explains the discrepancy.
really.
boys, the navigator's name was Absalon Fidalgo.
you know, this looks faint, but it looks as though this is the location where he abandoned ship.
impossible.
That-that'll put it northwest of the Campeche Bank.
follow your leader.
now that is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ and his representative on Earth, the Pope.
which puts the prime meridian in Rome, not Greenwich, England.
and that pulls the shipwreck way over toward Key West.
you pretty confident of your arithmetic?
I did it by pen, pencil, abacus and calculator.
Leo did it in his head. - It's correct.
then we are here.
maybe when I'm down there, you two keep an eye out.
for Brittany?
more concerned about who she's working for.
would you get a grip.
you're in denial that she tortured Pudge to death.
there was a sextant on her boat.
she thought it was some kind of telescope for a client.
now, he was probably below decks which is why she wouldn't let me on board.
that... is our bad guy.
very plausible interpretation.
Yeah, I'm sure she's the nice kind of meth smuggler.
got anything?
Naw. You got anything going on up there?
oil tanker maybe ten miles east.
you might want to rethink your maths.
do you see anything?
Yeah.
what did you find, Walter?
what do you got, amberjacks?
not aberjacks.
Brittany.
I suspect drowning.
that is a good guess since Walter here found her at the bottom of the ocean.
Really? Sarcasm?
because this body shouldn't even be here.
it should be on a coroner's lab in Miami.
I'm working for the Feds. This is a federal institution. Who are you working for?
me. - No. Not. That's not true.
in Cam's defense, there's no singular autopsy finding pathognomonic of drowning.
Ooh, what? You find something?
what is that?
well, it was in too far for her to have swallowed it on her own.
my guess is that her accomplice goes diving with her.
there's no treasure.
he gets angry, and blames Brittany, realizing that she's the only witness to the murder of Sam Nozik.
rips off her regulator and jams that down her throat.
wait a second. Is that blood? - Yeah.
I don't think it's all hers.
enough for DNA?
if our killer's in the database.
more than enough.
she bit the attacker's finger off.
unfortunately...
digestive fluids degraded the fingerprints.
don't touch that, Wally. That's evidence. - Please, come on.
this is the original stolen chart fragment.
my work's done.
what's this?
itemized invoice for my expenses... mostly fuel for Ike flying me back and forth.
but we haven't solved the murder. - Yeah, two murders.
two murders. We haven't solved two murders.
you hired me to find the missing chart fragment.
Eureka, ta-da, bingo.
mission accomplished. I found it.
uh, technically, I found it; In her throat.
Brittany's body was submerged under 80 feet of water in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.
I brought her here to you.
I'm pretty sure that's the impressive part.
that's true.
if it weren't for Walter, her remains would never have been discovered.
seriously.
before I tell you what I know, I want you to promise me the Church will get the treasure.
you got a deal, Eddie.
please... address me as "Excellency.
I'm a bishop.
Bishop-smishop.
we're here because you're an expert on Vatican treasure ships.
ironic, isn't it?
he helped me find my faith when I lost it;
now my faith is the thing about me he likes least.
where exactly did the three nails appear?
here.
follow your leader.
right after the chart was soaked in blood.
but that shouldn't bother you, Eddie.
you drink a goblet of the stuff every day when you give communion.
why is Walter angry at God this time?
the blood belongs to a girl.
and Walter intends to find her killer.
I'm sorry, Walter.
she'll be in my prayers.
Yeah.
your navigator had a secret so he used a special ink which would only appear when exposed to breast milk, semen or blood.
was he a Freemason or something?
worse.
three nails means he was a Jesuit.
jesuits are Catholic.
you are a Jesuit... Excellency.
at the time of the sinking of the Santa Esperanza, the Jesuits had been abolished by Pope Clement.
and why should that make a difference?
a Protestant measures from the Greenwich Observatory in England;
a Catholic, from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
what about a closet Jesuit?
from the Copernican Observatory on Monte Mario.
Thanks, Bish.
Walter, please sit.
I owe you my immortal soul.
I wish to discuss the brain damage you suffered in Iraq.
I'm gone.
don't bless me; I hate that.
is that decaf?
Decaf's what you ordered, isn't it?
I didn't ask what I ordered. I asked what you brought me.
don't punish her because you're mad at Ike and Eddie and God and yourself.
tell him it's decaf.
it's decaf.
why doesn't a cup of decaf cost more than a cup of normal coffee?
why should it?
well, it goes through the whole extra process to remove the caffeine, right?
so, why doesn't it cost more?
what's the coffee industry up to?
people don't like to pay more for something that's had something removed.
it's human psychology.
it's the coffee thing?
show him the pot.
see?
orange.
orange is for decaf.
Oh, yeah? Who came up with that rule?
Walter's upset that you and Eddie ganged up on him.
no.
where friends conspire to help someone they love, it isn't really conspiracy, is it?
you know, we-we don't understand why you choose to remain handicapped.
how is he handicapped? He can find anything.
and he's so paranoid he can't enjoy a simple cup of coffee.
how is it paranoia when my best friends are actually conspiring behind my back.
I'm not in this.
my people believe that gifted individuals, like Walter, hear Akashwani, or "a voice from the sky.
you think if you get treatment for your brain damage, you lose your finding mojo.
it's just nuts.
no, it's not nuts, Ike.
it's true.
okay.
there is an infinite, thrumming, unseen web that joins everything.
everything is connected to everything else.
I mean, this fact is nearly impossible for us to grasp because we are just mollusks, shut up tight at the bottom of a dark, cold ocean, trying to make sense of stars we cannot even see.
I challenge everything, because when I do, a quick bolt of electricity jolts between two elements that otherwise appeared unconnected.
I call it epiphany.
you want me to give that up, so I can enjoy a cup of decaf coffee?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
take me out of this dull world, for I would ride with you upon the wind.
what?
Wha-wha-what does that mean, Leo?
what the hell are you two talking about?
come on, Ike.
I'll be fine.
just so long as the world is full of lost things that need to be found.
you do know that the only infinite, thrumming web is right in here.
excuse me.
I'm sorry; my mistake.
it wasn't decaf.
I'm going to bring you a new pot.
every single time.
Akashwani.
Dr. Hodgins has something very important to tell you.
what?
there are three nails on the chart.
here. See? Clear as day.
so?
the three nails were purposely rendered in a kind of invisible ink.
it reacts to blood, semen, breast milk...
let's just get to the important part and then we'll back to the boring stuff.
if you want... we can figure out where to find that treasure.
since the dawn of navigation, latitude has never changed.
everyone was always in agreement.
the equator is zero degrees; No question: No debate.
but not longitude.
now we all agree that the Greenwich Observatory is zero degrees longitude.
but back in the olden days, there were hundreds of prime meridians, all of them completely arbitrary.
where did the ship go down?
the navigator of the Santa Esperanza didn't base his calculations on St. Peter's Basilica?
no.
because if he had, the treasure would be exactly where Walter Sherman found that girl's body.
now, the navigator of the Santa Esperanza was a Jesuit.
since this is where Fidalgo studied,
I'd put my money on the Copernican Observatory.
look at that.
I tell you, they're pretty close together.
but at the bottom of the ocean, you might as well be a hundred miles apart.
do you think that Walter found this out?
I don't know how he could have.
he did. He's got the finder power.
is that real?
Yes, it's real.
God, I hate that son of a bitch.
Santa Esperanza went down right here.
these are the exact coordinates.
have you verified the location of the wreck?
once we realized the navigator was Jesuit, it was child's play.
Oh... my God.
it's genuine, 17th century Madonna della Strada.
it's from the Santa Esperanza.
I'm astounded.
my gift from me to you.
Oh... I apologize.
Jesuit, you say?
the navigator was a secret Jesuit.
what led you to that conclusion?
blood on the chart revealed a secret sign.
blood?
your blood, to be precise.
I saw a 300-year-old sextant on Brittany's boat.
where else could that have come from but this place?
circumstantial at best.
what do you want?
uh, you must feel terrible.
just a slight mathematical adjustment, you could have had it all to yourself.
you're not the police.
so, what do you want?
what do I want?
I want Brittany Stephenson not to be dead.
Ike advised me to kill him.
discussing murder not only makes it conspiracy but confirms premeditation.
I advise against homicide.
Mmm, I'm a'risk it.
Walter... I'll be grievously offended if you kill him with Our Blessed Mother.
Ah... I'd never risk that, Leo.
maybe I could just arrest him for, uh, for stealing that treasure.
how is finding a treasure "stealing"?
he was working for the FBI... right?
... when he found that treasure.
and he can't just keep it.
Oh... Why do you dislike Walter so much?
okay, look.
Rebecca was in labor with Parker.
I wanted to be there for the birth of my son.
right? - Right.
so I can't get a pass. So I go AWOL.
so what happens?
military Police sends Walter after me, to find me.
I'm standing there, holding my newborn son, and in comes the finder, and he handcuffs me right there.
that was his job.
his job? Sometimes...
you know, in this line of work, as a human being, you just have to look the other way.
this is my chance to get a little payback, that's all.
we've been looking all over town for you.
okay.
is this the treasure? - Yeah, it better be.
better be?
Yeah, because if it's not, I'm going to arrest Walter.
is he in there?
which is why Walter decided to skip this little meeting.
arrest him on what charge?
booth says that Walter found the treasure while under contract to the FBI, so he can't keep it.
legally speaking, and acting upon my advice, - That's true. - What?
he presented us with a bill. Good one.
don't sound impressed. That's not... No.
we reported the location of the treasure to the original owners.
what, the Roman Catholic Church?
this isn't the treasure.
there's a human being in here.
oy, oy, Leo, off we go then.
all righty.
you kidnapped somebody?
there's a fine line between kidnapping and citizen's arrest.
I'm signaling my intention to pull out into traffic now.
no you're not,'cause if you do, I'll add "fleeing the scene" to my list of charges.
I'm sure you'll find that Walter exceeded the terms of your contract.
booth, you said that sometimes we look the other way.
Hey, Buddy. Got an extra finger. You want to try it on?
drowned Kitten versus Fat Girl Smoking.
that depends on if you like cats.
are we discussing which is sadder or which is more depressing?
same thing.
no.
depressing is a matter of personal taste, whereas sad is universal.
drowned kitten is sadder.
fat girl smoking is more depressing.
he's thinking about the bone lady.
Op-ti-mi-tist..." ..."versus Fool.
optimist, without a doubt.
fool, without a doubt.
I can't be the sole individual who's noticed the only thing Walter can't find...
is lasting love.
until now.
because the bones lady could be the one.
told you, Bones.
finder power.
there's a rational explanation for his abilities.
it's not magic.
maybe not. But it sure is magicky.
what do you call my amazing abilities, behind my back?
yours would be a rigorous application of training with an intense attention to detail.
Cheers.
I think Walter did look the other way, the day that Parker was born.
Seriously? Looked the other way?
he handcuffed me in front of my newborn son.
a newborn can see, at best, only between eight and 15 inches.
Parker probably wouldn't remember anyway, but more importantly,
Walter waited until after you had a chance to hold your newborn before he arrested you.
you know, I don't like the son of a bitch.
and you... there you go... and you can't make me.
cheers to that.
fair enough. - Right?
got your medal back.
I know this man. He's Ethan Sawyer.
Pelant killed my friend.
the evidence is piling up against Brennan.
this guy Pelant, he's framing you.
I swear to God, if you touch her, I will kill you.
I got to take your gun and badge.
rules are rules, cherie. There's nothing I can do.
what if he shows up at my house?
you got to make a run for it, honey. Now.
I'm gonna get my family back. You tell Bones that.
3 months later...
this is Da-da. This is Daddy.
Yeah, I bet the next time you see him, he'll have your tree house finished.
and this is all of us together.
Yes!
that's right.
we're all packed, sweetheart.
it's time to go.
you sure we have to leave again?
Yeah, we've been here too long.
new place is quite close.
give me that little... -- You want to go with your grandpa?
here we go.
hello.
do you really have to look at these while you work?
well, they inspire me.
Pelant framed her for murder.
if we can just figure out how he put her in the security footage, we can clear her.
do I really have to explain that to you?
there's something in Sawyer's triangle. If we can just...
you have been trying to crack this code for months, Angie.
now, you got to focus on something else, okay?
look at Pelant's library records again or why Caroline's bank accounts got hacked.
no, I'm telling you this holds the key.
maybe there's more than one key.
Hey, come on.
let's get you something to eat, okay?
those neurotransmitters of yours aren't gonna fire without your favorite BLT from the diner.
I miss her.
we all do. Come on.
Seeley, it's that time.
the answer is always the same: I haven't heard from her,
I have no idea where she is.
are we done now?
we have to go through all your phone calls, e-mails...
maybe if you spent more time looking into Pelant...
we can't, you know that. We have nothing on him.
you know what? He was in my house.
I saw him on my security tapes.
Yeah, but when we looked at the footage, somehow he was gone.
well, he erased himself with the computer. That's his thing.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do with all of your theories.
you're supposed to believe me.
okay, I can't go through all this again.
I'll find Pelant with or without you.
the issue now is Dr. Brennan. She's a fugitive.
look, just come into my office.
Oh, look at that, it's lunchtime.
even us desk jockeys, we gotta eat, right?
I'll get you a sandwich.
roast beef, right?
uh, no, I got it. That's right, tuna, extra mayo.
[ Pelant Brookside Shelter ]
Seeley, don't do anything stupid.
you had a question? -- Ms. Montenegro. Yes. Come in.
no. You can come out here if you want to talk to me.
just because this is my office now doesn't mean I stole it from Dr. Brennan.
you could have said no.
you could have worked from one of the desks out here.
okay, I'm not doing this.
I need your report from last week's victim: Wallace, Brian.
I told you everything I discovered.
and I need you to put it in a binder because we use binders now so everyone has access to the same information.
Brennan didn't use binders. She could remember...
I am not Dr. Brennan. I use binders.
and people like my binders.
is everything okay here?
he's wasting my time. Unless you don't think that breaking Pelant's code is important.
Oh, come on. That's not even the point!
look, she won't do any of the written reports for the binders.
Yeah, because if he can't do the job like Brennan, then...
he's not Dr. Brennan, Angela.
and he is the resident forensic anthropologist here.
you will respect him.
I don't believe this.
I mean, don't you care?
no, don't, don't go there. Not with me.
we are all doing what we can to get Dr. Brennan cleared and back here.
but this lab has other work to do as well.
well, my first priority is clearing Brennan.
so if you want to stay here and use this facility to decode Pelant's handiwork, you'll cooperate with Dr. Edison.
don't do this. -- I'll be fine.
well, that's for me to decide.
I have kept you safe so far, have I not?
I have to, Dad. It's the only way.
tempe, please, let's figure something else out, all right? Please.
just take care of Christine until I get back.
now I know the economy hasn't been a friend to any of you, and you all want to find employment.
mastering the spreadsheet will give you a skill you can apply to many jobs.
now place your cursor on the top... top of the far left column.
I'd like to volunteer.
mine isn't moving.
it's not working.
uh, um, you just have to left-click the mouse when you get there.
cool, boss. -- Good job.
special Agent Hayes Flynn, please.
maybe you can talk to Seeley.
Pelant's threatening to file charges for stalking.
Seeley isn't gonna listen to anyone until Pelant's locked up, you know that.
you say this tip was anonymous.
was it a man or a woman?
I'm not sure. The voice was disguised.
the audio techs are working on it now.
well, why would... why would anyone go to the trouble of disguising their voice to report a crime?
your guess is as good as mine.
then how come every time we guess Pelant, you don't agree?
how long has your team been here?
ten minutes.
we found it like this.
the remains were uncovered through keyhole excavation and then through step-trenching.
each layer has been revealed and highlighted by brushing, not digging.
very professional. -- Very.
thus making it possible for forensics experts, like us, to pinpoint time of burial.
who could do something like this?
I know who taught me. -- Dr. Brennan.
it's also possible that these remains are Dr. Brennan's and that Pelant is playing with us.
what is it?
it's a snowdrop.
this isn't Brennan.
she left this for us.
Hey, put together a search team now.
Dr. Brennan's been here. I want her brought in.
now!
Galanthus nivalis Galanthus blooms in winter, before the vernal equinox, signifying spring's approach.
it's a symbol of hope.
okay... Meaning?
well, isn't it obvious?
it's obvious that the high nasal bridge...
Brennan wants us to know that solving this murder will clear her name so that she can come home.
meaning Pelant killed this woman?
high nasal bridge indicates Caucasian.
Angela, how do you get all that from a flower?
uh, I didn't say anything about a flower.
she won't tell me anything either.
sternal rib contour puts age at between 35 and 39 years old, and this pelvic inlet belongs to a woman who has never given birth.
Oh, it's just so wonderful to have your attention.
I'd like you to send everything we know to Booth end of day today.
by messenger?
by e-mail.
by e-mail?
Yes. Include the flower stuff.
your express instructions were to avoid e-mails in any case involving Pelant.
there's no evidence that Pelant is involved here.
and I think Booth should have this news immediately.
bones sent you a message saying, "Have hope." Okay, how?
I can't tell you. -- Thanks for nothing, Ange.
Hey, why are you so mad at me?
how are you communicating with Bones?
I can't tell you 'cause she made me promise.
bones has been missing for three months.
you have been communicating with her for three months.
I haven't. You won't tell me how.
I haven't even told Hodgins.
Hodgins gets to go home every night with with the woman he loves and gets to see his child. I don't.
I'm sorry.
Oh, wait a second. Do you know anything about this e-mail from Clark?
Yeah. Cam made him send it even though...
the remains match the description of a high school guidance counselor Carole Morrisey who went missing ten years ago.
I'll tell her that you love her... like I always do.
great. Thanks, but I'll tell her myself.
according to local law enforcement, they received an anonymous phone call from an unknown man directing officers to these human remains just off of a popular jogging trail.
see? Now that's exactly what you wanted to have happen.
there's Hodgins and Angela and...
it looks like Clark is doing a very good job, but...
I would like to see Booth standing there with his pen and index cards.
well, you see Cam, right? You know who she's talking to?
she's talking to Booth.
the citizens of Pitt Meadows, Virginia... quintessential small town America...
are coming to the realization that their town isn't as safe as they thought.
sheriff Frame has reportedly asked for help from the FBI and the forensic specialists at the Jeffersonian Institution.
reporting live in Pitt Meadows, Elizabeth Howe, CNB News.
Yeah, look, it's me.
you know that guidance counselor you have on your slab?
don't say it that way. She used to be a person.
well, her name is Carole Morrisey.
guess who went to her high school?
that's right.
do you think Pelant killed her? -- Not at all.
do you think Dr. Brennan thinks he killed her?
not in the least.
you're on your way there, aren't you? -- Nope.
you're lying in case Flynn asks me any questions.
you know what, I don't think anything.
I'm on my way to Atlantic City.
and after this conversation, this phone goes dead.
got it.
okay. Okay.
I don't know where Booth is.
I don't think you're being completely honest with me.
then you have trust issues, stemming from...
I don't know, a bunch of psychological crap.
something's going on. There's a murder in Pelant's hometown,
booth heads off to Atlantic City?
I'm sorry to hear that Agent Booth is still struggling with his gambling addiction.
you hear from Booth, you call me within ten seconds.
Yeah, he won't call me.
why not, you two have a spat?
no, he doesn't want me to lie to you.
clever.
everyone around here is so damn clever.
I knew you'd come.
wow, I can't believe how big she's gotten! Look at her!
huh? Man... And you're okay? She's okay, too, right?
we're better now.
Da-da. Da-da? Did you hear that?
she said "da-da." Da-da! Da da da da da da.
well, I tell her about you every day, and she is quite brilliant.
Oh, yeah. Of course, she takes after her dad, huh? Ha ha, the Da-da.
she said "da-da." Going in, yes.
look at this!
breakfast, huh?
my father thought I was crazy for uncovering that body, but I just couldn't live any more without knowing when this was going to end.
how'd you find the teacher?
dad and I started looking into Pelant's history growing up.
school records, newspaper clippings.
that's when we found out that his high school guidance counselor disappeared.
no explanation, just vanished. She was a runner, so...
Ah, she was doing cross-country training in the woods.
exactly.
so I combed the area for weeks, until I found some discolored vegetation.
Yes, that's because organic content decomposing changes the appearance of plant life.
right? Doesn't it, right? Yes, it does. -- Yes.
Oh, well, you know, I missed you, so I was reading some of your books.
they're thick. They're really... they're heavy.
I only had time to excavate the remains, so all I have to examine are these photographs.
but they're not enough.
well, it's okay. I mean, Cam's got all the remains back at the Jeffersonian.
they'll find out what happened.
Plus, they'll get all the school records to Sweets.
no, I have to be the one to examine the remains, Booth. There has to be a way that...
look, you don't think that Pelant knows what's going on?
he'll expose you.
he's right, honey.
that's why I have to pack us up.
already?
well, Booth being here changes everything.
I know.
there's staining to the trabecular of the sternum.
there must have been a lot of internal bleeding for staining this deep.
the trauma to the posterior aspect of the skull shows fracturing, which reached a depth of ten to 14 millimeters.
which would have damaged the cerebrocerebellum.
but wouldn't give us cause of death.
an injury like this would impair motor skills at the worst.
this fracturing looks like it was made while the victim was moving away.
please put your findings into the binder.
so what we have here is a deep initial blow, and then a quick extraction, which resulted in tapering off to a mere scraping of the bone.
which would happen if the victim was moving away from her assailant.
so if we ID what caused the fracturing, then we can link it to the killer.
I swabbed the skull injuries. -- Yeah?
it was a rock. Red agate.
what? That doesn't make any sense.
I -- If the rock was a weapon, or if she fell on it, it wouldn't have caused this kind of wound track.
sorry, but it was definitely red agate.
did you put your findings into the binder?
okay, so Hodgins told me to look at everything fresh.
forget about the triangle.
and do we hate him or love him for this?
we love him.
so, you got suspended because Pelant made it look like Brennan was paying you off so you wouldn't arrest her, right?
you're telling me this again so you could rub it in?
no.
no, I'm tell you this because I figured out how Pelant did it.
I have proof that your electronic signature and Brennan's were forged.
you can prove Pelant did that?
no.
I can prove that it was done, but I... I can't tie it back to Pelant.
he used a parameterized complexity, which is this... He covered his tracks.
but you can clear me.
totally.
I'm gonna send this to the computer forensics team at the FBI.
then I can get back on this case and put that rank little weasel in jail for the rest of his scrawny-ass life.
do I sound bitter?
Oh, not nearly enough.
well, I'm just warming up.
Hey, Bones, you got anything off those pictures?
it looks like there are nicks to C5 and C6, but they could just be anomalies on the image.
I -- I have to examine the bones.
no, you can't do that. Listen, Bones, we can't keep going through this.
well, I can't live like this anymore.
well, what kind of life are we going to have if they catch you and throw you in jail for the rest of your life?
I feel like I'm already there. -- You're not, okay?
I'm here. Christine is here.
that's all that matters right now, all right?
just take a look at the photos.
one more time.
how'd you get them to give me the victim's case file?
I'm back on the case, cherie.
and that means you are, too. So speak to me.
what did you find out about the guidance counselor?
okay. In the year leading up to her writing his letter of recommendation to Stanford,
Pelant was suspended for hacking into the school's computer system to change a grade.
his college recommendation makes him out to be a saint.
well, Pelant always likes looking like a saint. But...
when you analyze the idiolect used in this letter...
every one I talk to today is trying to give me a headache.
the language patterns. You know, linguistic variations of the author.
they're like stylistic and psychological fingerprints.
thank you. -- Okay.
so I went through some old articles that Pelant wrote for the school paper, an essay he won an award for, as well as some papers that he wrote at Stanford.
they were all very clinical.
you know, determinedly rationalistic, clear and concise. But...
when I did a multivariate analysis on the other letters of recommendation from the guidance counselor,
I found far more descriptive and modified linguistics.
let me guess. But not in the recommendation she wrote for Pelant.
Pelant may be able to erase what he wants digitally, but he doesn't know how to erase his writing style.
so he wrote the recommendation himself, and then killed her so he could go to a school he wanted to?
well, Stanford was the only school he applied to.
little toad liked getting his way even then.
and this is the last recommendation sent before she disappeared.
so Clark should re-examine these remains.
these nicks are not from being buried.
these are cut marks.
okay, well, maybe I can help him determine what kind of weapon was used.
Brennan's probably going crazy not being able to get her hands on these remains.
I'd like her to know that we're making progress.
um... Do you think that you could do me a favor?
you've been talking to her.
uh... no, no.
I... um, I... Honey, don't ask questions.
how have you been doing it?
I just need you to put flowers someplace.
is it a code?
I-I don't want to get into it.
Angie, come on. You don't trust me? -- It's not about that.
if... if I'm the only one who knows, then everybody else is clean.
you know it has to be that way.
will you help?
beautiful flowers, Dr. Hodgins.
and ingenious.
you son of a bitch.
we're watching you.
we're getting closer.
and just know, if you come near any of us, if you threaten any of us...
sounds like you're threatening me, Dr. Hodgins.
I am.
I will kill you.
know that.
I read your FBI files.
the, uh, psychologist reports?
while exhibiting anger and hostility toward authority, Dr. Hodgins uses "harmless conspiracy theorizing"as an outlet.
thoroughly prosocial and empathetic, Hodgins represents no threat.
sorry.
sorry, but... you're too good a person, Dr. Hodgins.
you're not capable of killing me.
people change.
Yeah, this is an interesting fact: you're gasping for air, but see, it's not your lungs that are crying out for oxygen.
it's your brain.
that's what's dying.
that brilliant brain of yours.
yeah... You're getting weaker, aren't you? Hmm?
a little dizzy.
I sound very far away, don't I?
that big brain of yours isn't much help now, hmm?
is it?
Pelant was there.
you admit to communicating with a wanted murder suspect using flowers.
ms. Montenegro had no idea with whom she was... or was not... in communication.
Pelant was there... how about we talk about that?
did you interact with him in any way?
no, I did not. No matter what he says.
what's that supposed to mean?
symbolic flowers are a pretty limited form of communication.
Yeah, it was mostly Brennan... Or someone else.
... telling Booth that she was okay.
or somebody else.
got it.
she was waiting for me to tell her that I had figured out how Pelant framed her for the murder of Ethan Sawyer.
which I have not been able to do, yet.
well, I'll tell you what you're gonna do.
you're gonna go to the next grave on your list, and you're gonna leave a flower that says, "Surrender yourself to the FBI."
I can't do that. -- Then I will arrest you.
Oh, cut that out, now. You will not.
I know what you're trying to do, Agent Flynn.
Dr. Brennan isn't gonna show up at the next drop now that Pelant knows this flower system.
okay, cyber-boy, this is the real world now.
I'm not gonna lead you back to her.
but if you want to follow me, I hope you like Mexican food, because we're headed for the border.
there's something nobody knows that I'm going to tell you now.
I lied to Flynn; I interacted with Pelant.
how?
I... I choked him until he was unconscious.
I was gonna kill him.
until I remembered that if I did that,
Brennan would never be able to come home.
you choked a man till he passed out?
a bad man who killed people.
you're hinting that if I'd killed him, I'd be bad, too?
hinting?
sweets, I'm not the interesting part of this.
listen to me.
Pelant wanted me to kill him.
how could you tell?
I can't explain it, it just...
he was staring in my face while I did it, and what I read there was,"Do it. Do it."
so you're saying Pelant is suicidal.
I am telling you that he was happy that I wanted to kill him.
okay? It just... It seemed like something you should know.
what I know is that you and I need to discuss the fact that you are capable of murder.
not cold-blooded murder.
if it's true that Pelant actually wanted you to kill him, that's different from being suicidal.
which makes it extremely valuable information.
there are fairly deep nicks here, on the anterior of the C5 and C6.
her throat was slit?
not really consistent with a knife.
they're pretty deep.
I'll consult with Angela, but, uh...
given the size of Pelant at the age of 16, the weapon is probably heavier.
okay, the key will be to tie Pelant to the murder specifically.
you mean tie the weapon to the murderer.
Dr. Brennan would have done that better, too, I know.
I apologize.
for what?
for not realizing sooner that what you're working toward here, to clear Dr. Brennan and bring her home, will most likely lead to you losing your position here.
it definitely occurred to me.
yet, what didn't occur to you was to do a bad job.
I'll never forget that.
five hours.
Yeah, we should get out of here.
no, the arrangement was always that if Dad wasn't back from a pick-up in six hours,
Christine and I would get the hell out of Dodge.
Max's term, I'm guessing.
at least Max has a good reason for not coming back.
that doesn't make me feel any better.
Oh, believe me, I know.
Oh, Booth. I had to go. You know why. You understand.
I understand. Totally.
I didn't know what else to do.
I... it would never be my first choice to cause you pain.
look... if he's not back in an hour, we have to go.
you should've stolen that car, Agent Booth.
Max, what are you doing?
I'm trying to start your car.
what do you mean, start my car? Why?
I saw Psycho Boy at the graveyard today.
tell me you didn't try to kill him.
no, no, what, in broad daylight?
with people everywhere? No.
get out of the car.
did you buy your car?
Yeah. With cash, under a fake name.
Yeah, well, it's traceable.
mine is stolen. It's untraceable.
you take that.
I will take this, and Mr. Pelant will come after this one, and I will kill him.
no, no, no, no, Max. No, Max.
just turn it off. Bad idea, Max.
Yeah, Flynn, it's, uh... Booth.
listen, I've tried talking some sense into Brennan, tried to bring her in.
sure you did.
she's heading south on State Road 47, north of Cullen.
she's driving a, uh,'86 blue Toyota Cressida with Pennsylvania plates.
you're the second person to call that car in as stolen.
Yes, Dr. Hodgins?
you need to leave.
I beg your pardon?
and take Clark with you.
and the security guards, and everybody.
what about you?
I will be in my office, getting caught up on the white binders.
and seeing absolutely nobody you shouldn't see.
I don't understand.
I am taking you to dinner, we're gonna have drinks.
we actually may drink so much that we're late in the morning.
okay.
but are all the security guards coming with us? What's happening?
all good? -- Yeah.
okay.
all right.
look, we don't have a lot of time before people figure out you're here.
so you're sure you can do this? -- Clark is very organized.
his binders are quite a brilliant idea.
is something wrong, Angela? -- Yeah.
I... I really missed you, so much. -- That's great, okay.
don't you have some kind of computer code you have to crack?
all right, um... This has all the information the FBI needs to track the incoming and outgoing e-mails on our secure server.
Thanks. -- Yeah.
we'll need to swab the injuries on C5 and C6. -- I'm on it.
Sweets! Finally.
agent Booth.
I'm very uncomfortable about this.
you know, as an FBI agent, it's my sworn duty to arrest Dr. Brennan.
it's so good to see you, by the way.
it's been too long.
you, too. -- Just give her a day. Okay?
if she can't find the answer, you can arrest her, -- and me, for harboring a criminal. -- Me, too.
why do you want him here?
I needed someone I could trust to protect you.
someone I knew who had a gun, and knew how to use it.
Master-rated marksman, so...
great, thanks, I gotta get this to Flynn.
there are also injuries from L5 to L3.
from his notes, Dr. Edison posited an axe.
well, if I find out what it was made from, maybe I can narrow down what kind of axe.
Pelant has hacked into secure e-mails between the Jeffersonian and the FBI.
that's a violation of his parole.
look, we can lock him up while we're putting this whole murder case against him.
first of all, Seeley, I have no idea what any of this means.
right. We just get the computer forensics guys to look at it.
well, how about we get your full statement first, about where you disappeared to and who you've been with?
forget procedure. Let's get this to forensics, now.
as far as any government agency is concerned, Pelant is clean, Seeley.
if I go after him with no cause...
how are you going to feel when he walks away from this murder, just like all the others?
or better yet, how are you going to feel if next time he kills someone you know?
Yeah. This is Flynn.
I need your best guy in the fourth floor conference room, now.
so get his ass out of bed.
the desiccated cartilage on the lateral femoral and tibial condyles indicate tearing.
so that's good.
not for the victim.
well... yeah.
coupled with the torn cartilage on the talus and medial malleolus, it means she was hung upside down, which also explains the blood staining on the inside of the sternum.
okay, so you're saying she was hung, gutted, and bled?
that is consistent with both Dr. Saroyan's and Dr. Edison's findings, as noted.
all right, so we're close.
this means I don't have to arrest you.
right? Not close enough yet.
Dr. Hodgins?
I don't have the results yet.
no, I'm thinking about the skull.
what was the trace you found there?
it's red agate. It's a rock found in Virginia.
why aren't your findings included in Dr. Edison's binder?
Really?
Oh. Sorry. Yeah, it's all here.
Angie did a model of what the agate would have looked like to make the wound track.
Pelant snared the victim while she was running through the woods.
as she fell backward, her head hit the rock.
the wound retracted because she was being pulled up.
my God, we've missed you.
now we just need a murder weapon.
excellent, Mr. Bobrick.
now, uh, open up the spreadsheet and input the new figures.
christopher Pelant, you are under arrest for violating the federal computer fraud and abuse statute 18 U.S.C. 1030.
th -- that's not true. I haven't done anything.
you have. Even a genius can make a few mistakes.
that's too tight!
not for me, it isn't. Let's go.
8: 00 a. m. on a Sunday morning, this better be good.
they took Pelant into custody after hacking into an FBI e-mail system, so we have a little room to breathe.
well, I'll be damned.
don't be so surprised.
you made Clark send that e-mail to set up Pelant.
Oh, you and your conspiracy theories.
are you any closer to tying the murder to Pelant?
I discovered some traces of tamahagane in the bone.
it's a Japanese steel. Hopefully it'll help Dr. B.
who, of course, is not here.
of course not.
which is why you can tell security that they won't be needed on a Sunday to check the lab, because I'll be here to look after things.
that is very generous of you.
Hey, I'm nothing if not dedicated.
this gobbledygook is your friend Ethan's code, and I cannot get a line on this at all.
I'm sorry.
Ethan was extremely schizophrenic when he wrote this.
we don't really know how much reality he could grasp.
it's not gobbledygook.
how do you know?
because Pelant wouldn't have killed Ethan Sawyer if that didn't scare him in some way.
this triangle... it's a scientist's effort to distill, uh, human motivation into a rational construct, correct?
that's one way to put it.
there are three sides to a triangle.
your understanding of geometry is not very advanced.
well, I wasn't finished.
there are three sides to Pelant:
one, the base is his constant rebirth into innocence, you know, the face that he shows the world.
okay.
side number two is his secret personae.
what does that mean? -- The killer, the secret murderer.
and side number three?
Hodgins provided me with that yesterday.
Pelant wants one of us to kill him.
all right, so right in the dumper with that one, huh?
why would you say that?
her face went all blank.
no, blank is Angela's thinking face.
it means leave her alone. Oh.
come on. -- Sorry.
Dr. Edison was extremely thorough.
everyone hates entering notes into those white binders.
I know the problem. -- What problem?
with the weapon. It's not an axe.
even you can't tell that in a glance, Dr. Brennan.
no, I can tell it by looking at the findings in Dr. Edison's notebook.
you figured that the weapon was a heavily weighted object like an axe because Pelant was small in high school.
in fact, he was heavy.
all the photos of Pelant in the yearbook show him to be slight of stature.
those are all digital.
my father looked him up an actual paper yearbook and found that Pelant never appeared.
then how do you know he was heavy?
a 200-pound person puts approximately 600 pounds of pressure on their knee joints just by walking.
even after the weight is lost, there are lingering symptoms of osteoarthritis which affect gait, carriage and posture.
Pelant was fat?
in the vernacular, yes.
the salient point is that the weapon 16-year-old Christopher Pelant used to kill Carole Morrisey weighed significantly less than an axe.
Dr. Hodgins determined that the weapon was made of tamahagane;
the steel used in the traditional Japanese smelting process used to make swords.
Pelant used a Japanese sword?
dad had coffee with Pelant's grandfather a couple of times.
he fought in World War II, Pacific theater.
it was common for soldiers to bring back souvenirs from battle.
Caroline will get a warrant to search the family home.
you got him.
perhaps.
no, you got him.
satisfied?
I'd be more satisfied if he were dead.
no, we're putting him away for murder, Max.
better him than me, I guess.
this guy Pelant, he needs killing, Booth.
booth picked this up, so I have no idea how good it is.
as long as it has booze in it, I'll be fine.
um, it's, uh, it's not my house, obviously, and it's not my party, but if I could just have your attention for a second.
um, I would like you all to know that I have officially relinquished control of the Major Crimes Unit to my good friend Seeley Booth.
I get my office back now.
all right, but I'm keeping the chair.
mm, no chair.
dude, come on, let's keep it civil.
seriously. It's like lumbar nirvana.
we'll figure that out.
all right, anyway, not that I have not enjoyed working with you squints, but, um, I'm gonna take my chances with domestic terrorism.
uh, less prickly type of personality over there.
that's not true.
he's being hyperbolic, I think.
go ahead. Go ahead.
I would like to announce that Dr. Temperance Brennan is no longer a suspect in the murder of Ethan Sawyer and can resume her rightful place at the Jeffersonian.
Oh, I have an announcement to make.
the Jeffersonian actually needs two forensic anthropologists:
one to solve crime, and the other to pursue serious archaeological work.
I hate crime... and I love serious archaeological work!
I love crime.
I've been angry at Angela for the past three months, and I...
thanks for getting my family back.
thank you.
Hey. How are you?
Hey, look at that! Bones is back, right?
you still angry with me?
no.
I did what I thought was right for Christine.
I know. You did the right thing.
if... if I told you we were leaving, you would have been an accomplice.
we needed you here to catch Pelant.
bones, you don't have to explain. You did the right thing. I understand.
I'm sorry.
why are you sorry for doing the right thing?
I'm sorry for how you must have felt when I did the right thing.
Yeah, you know what?
I think I like you better as a blonde.
Oh, no.
get up here.
hold on.
no, Booth. -- Booth.
what?
what's going on?
if you can't behave yourself then you're going to have to turn around because that is a fully accredited representative of the Egyptian government, which I wasn't certain still existed.
what did you mean when you said Pelant is not Pelant?
that man is Bassam Alfayat.
no, that is most definitely Christopher Pelant. His physiognomy...
his fingerprints, DNA, work history, medical records, everything identifies him as Alfayat.
so does his official history:
left Egypt age six, boarding school in England, Canada, then high school and university here.
you're saying that he wiped out his identity and created a new one?
the Egyptians are taking him home tonight.
there's nothing you can do? -- Nothing.
booth? Please?
if you hurt him, you will lose your job.
that's assault. She assaulted me!
I'm a witness, if you want to stay here and press charges.
get him out of here.
if you're not gonna kiss her, I just might have to do it myself.
what kind of flower is that?
it's a marigold.
what's that mean?
"pain and grief." It means "Pain and grief."
I have done extensive research, Booth. This is the best stroller on the market.
Plus, the design is beautiful. And it's cerise.
it has a name? -- Color. Cerise is a color.
look, I only paid 500 bucks for my first car.
I can afford it. -- No.
we've been through this. All our expenses are split right down the line.
you're too sensitive. It's just money.
rich people always say that. That's what they say.
well, didn't you say that you might be getting a raise soon?
and until then, Christine will be fine in a cheaper stroller that's a color people have heard of, like...
don't do that. Not that look, please.
don't give me the sad eyes. -- Please.
Ah, come on. No, I'm not looking. I'm driving.
come on. -- Just keep driving.
Oh, you were never able to do this look before the baby.
what did the baby do to you?
okay. All right, I'll be right there.
there was an explosion in the parking garage of the Baird Hotel.
let's go. Hold on.
booth. Yeah, hey, Caroline.
if this is about the explosion at the Baird Hotel, we were already on our way.
what? Wait a second. Why not?
wait, I always go with Bones. Okay, okay, I'm...
Oh, wow. What is it?
she just hangs up on me. I don't know.
Caroline needs to see me in the office.
I guess I'll just have to meet you at the crime scene later.
okay. -- Cerise?
I'll pick up one of these on the way. -- No, no.
I can stop at the store. -- No, no, no.
I've got another piece over here.
more bags, please.
when they said, "bomb," they weren't kidding, right?
seems that the victim left the hotel to get to his car and kaboom.
Ah, it's a good argument for valet parking.
how many victims?
well, no duplication of organs so far.
looks like just the one.
lone victim could mean a targeted hit.
well, we're gonna be here for a while. The body parts are spread over most of the third floor.
Yeah, his body was blown pretty much everywhere.
here, found this chunk of mystery muscle wedged in the undercarriage.
it's pharynx, but thank you all the same, Dr. Hodgins.
no cratering under the car, so it wasn't a chassis bomb.
the stall amplified the blast.
so, since the walls are actually solid concrete, the blast wave bounced off them and shot out like a cannon.
maybe, you don't sound so happy about it. It's kind of creepy.
Nah, I've loved combustion variables ever since I blew up the multipurpose room for my middle school science fair project.
first time I made it onto a watch list.
Yeah, that's a lot less creepy.
the bomb techs said that when the gas tank blew, it turned the stall into a blast furnace.
so, no VIN number. No license plates left.
I have to study the victim's bones back at the lab in order to do a proper identification.
picking up a bouquet of sodium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, ooh, just a hint of what? Sour milk or -- what is that -- rotten eggs?
I know that smell. It's intestines and stomach.
stomach and intestines can be useful, so if you can keep an eye out...
found 'em.
Oh, don't move, Dr. Hodgins.
Mm-mm, wouldn't think of it.
okay.
um, could you take the big pieces off first?
just a couple more little ones.
the body suffered an immediate and complete disruption.
burns, lacerations, contusions.
soft tissue was extensively mangled.
the skull was severed at the atlas and axis.
all right, I'm no coroner, but I'm saying the cause of death was a humongous explosion.
the coroner concurs.
Osteon density of the victim's femur suggests mid-40s.
I'm gonna start a facial reconstruction.
can I borrow the skull before you pull the gunk off of it?
Oh, here's some nose to go with. -- Yummy.
check out this plastic. Propylene.
it's an UltraGulp cup.
the plastic on this one fragmented outward, so the killer must have used it to conceal the bomb.
which means we can narrow our suspect down to anyone with access to an UltraGulp cup.
the case practically solves itself.
look, Caroline, I gotta go. I can't wait any longer.
if you need me, just call my cell.
all right, start with the, uh, hotel security, you know.
they should have surveillance tapes.
Daisy's gonna be gone for five days, so I have to figure out what to buy her.
sweets, a guy just blew up. -- Sorry.
why do you have to buy her a gift? -- I like buying her things.
okay, you know what you would say to me? You'd say you were overcompensating.
over... why would I be overcompensating?
wow, you're a little defensive. -- No, I'm not. Am I?
little bit. -- I don't think so.
just a little bit, there. I just left you a message.
Cherie, I need to see you in your office.
Oh, no, no, no, we're going to the Baird Hotel, you know. We're gonna go look at some surveillance tapes.
Seeley Booth! When I drag myself out of the relative comforts of my cramped office, it means that it's urgent. Sweet Pea will get the tapes.
you been to Blockbuster, right?
same principle. -- No, no, no, he can't go alone.
that's not protocol. -- Fine, fine.
you, are you an agent?
uh, yes, ma'am, Special Agent Olivia Sparling. I'm new here.
you'll do. Someone went boom at the Baird.
find out who did it and bring 'em to justice. Easy peasy.
Dr. Sweets will fill you in.
ain't no easy peasy about this, okay? This is my case.
don't be possessive, cherie. Now it's their case, too.
and your bosses say you are mine until further notice.
you two are working together. -- Ah, but...
you heard the man. Lovely.
now let's stroll to your office.
looks like we're working together.
why did she call you doctor?
because I'm a doctor. I'm a psychologist, a profiler.
you got to be kidding. I'm working with a shrink.
I'm more than just a shrink. Okay?
the bureau gave me a gun, okay?
I should take the lead on questioning people. It's kind of my thing.
just don't shoot me.
I was having lunch at the commissary, minding my own ham and rye, when my boss came up steaming that he was going to get the DOJ bean counters to look into your budget.
Why? We have the highest conviction rate in the district.
and the highest cost per conviction.
and they're blaming me, too,'cause I work with you people.
so, you're gonna have to justify your department's expenses at the quarterly budget review.
me? No, not me. I work in the field. Here.
that's why you are doing it.
big burly agent like you will intimidate the pencil necks.
I'd waive your gun around a little, too, if I were you.
there's got to be someone else here.
I'm sorry, cherie, but there is no one burlier or cuter than you.
stop. -- The good news is, if you get that budget through, your boss says there's a promotion in it for you.
you won't have to run around getting shot at anymore.
sorry, did you say promotion? -- With a raise.
you do like money, right? -- Yes.
you just go through all the supplies we used last quarter, cost for extra manpower, techs and such.
um, then estimate the cost for the coming quarter.
uh, supplies? -- Kevlar vests, uh, ammo, toner for the printers.
toner? -- The government doesn't function without toner, cherie.
so, the explosive that powered the bomb had a methylammonium nitratemetha base.
it's commercial grade, but, unfortunately, that means it could have been made by any number of companies.
maybe this will help you.
I found it embedded in a piece of his liver. It's inorganic.
it's part of a wire and some metal fragments.
this could be part of the detonator.
that would help narrow down the source of the bomb.
well, yeah, but... you should have given this to the FBI bomb squad.
Yeah, but they're backlogged and you seem to enjoy explosions so much.
you are the best boss ever.
I know, but I also figured this would prevent you from blowing up things in the lab.
it will, right?
the hotel is very upset and deeply saddened by the tragedy in our parking structure.
it's always sad whenever anyone explodes. That's why we need to see your security tapes.
and I want to give them to you, but you understand I have to go through the legal department.
we have many important guests. -- This is a murder investigation, Mr. Franklin.
of course, but there are procedures. If you all had a warrant...
you're stalling. I don't have time for stalling.
uh, Agent Sparling, I think if we just explain to Mr. Franklin...
who paid you to plant a bomb? -- I don't know what you're talking about.
you didn't get a Breitling watch or Prada shoes on a rent-a-cop's salary.
I'm not saying anything. You come back with a warrant, you'll get your tapes.
agent Sparling, if we just made it clear to Mr. Franklin it's in his best interest...
I'm not leaving you alone to erase those tapes, got it? -- I want to speak to my lawyer.
great, you can call him from the FBI office. We're taking you into custody.
you had something to say, Doctor?
Oh, no, I was just thinking maybe it be a good idea to keep him from lawyering up, but we're past that now, so let's just...
if I get this promotion, I wouldn't be in the field as much, but, hey, that could be a good thing, you know.
but you'd be behind a desk. You'd hate that.
but I would get a raise, and I would love that.
a desk job? It's like caging an animal. You're meant to run free, Booth.
look, I can't be in the field forever. I mean, come on.
I've got to think of other, you know, important things.
there's Christine, you know, and Parker.
you sure? -- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
I mean, hey, this... this is...
this office stuff is really interesting.
do you know how many dry eraser markers the Bureau goes through in three months?
I... Sweets! Sweets, hey!
how was the hotel, and the, uh, you know, security tapes?
Oh. Good. Yeah. Once the hotel found out Franklin was a suspect, they handed over everything.
Yeah. And? There are 83 cameras and over 1, 900 hours of footage.
it's going to take a while to go through them, so I'm gonna...
booth was about to tell me how many dry erase markers the Bureau goes through in a three-month period.
Why? -- Tell me about the security guy?
he's still in custody, but we don't have anything on him yet.
did you know that the Bureau purchased 8, 231 thumb drives last quarter?
bones. -- What's going on here?
he told me that. -- Bones, let Sweets focus.
this is a very important case. -- Sure, sure.
how is the new agent you're working with?
good. She's fine. I...
she's really green, obviously, but... I'm bringing her along, you know. Sweets.
Hey, I ran the facial reconstruction through the DMV database and got a hit.
robert Carlson. He lives in a suburb of Bethesda with his wife.
great, awesome. -- Wait, wait. What, uh, what's awesome?
I'll text you the address. -- Thank, Angela.
uh, hi. Uh, Angela got a match on the reconstruction, a man in Bethesda.
right. And? Anything else?
not yet. I'm gonna go talk to his wife.
sorry to run. -- Booth understands.
right. Hey, hey. Hey! I understand.
I totally understand. I'm cool.
he's gonna be... he's gonna be great.
you were very direct with the desk clerk at the hotel, and I was very impressed.
I thought I might have intimidated you.
no. No way. It was good. It was good work.
but notifying a woman that her husband has died is different.
it requires, um, a certain finesse. A delicate touch. I...
all yours, Doc. -- All right.
Mrs. Gina Carlson? -- Yes.
I'm Dr. Lance Sweets with the FBI. This is my associate, Agent Sparling.
I'm afraid we have some difficult news to share with you.
is this your husband?
Oh, God, no. Oh, please, no.
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Carlson, but your husband was found dead this morning.
this is horrible.
these feelings can be difficult to process. -- Oh, God.
what? -- Uh, hon? Is there something the matter?
what in the hell is the matter with you people?
hang on. -- That is my husband.
that is my husband, that is Robert!
why would you put me through this?
I didn't... -- That is my husband!
I agree, you can take point on this one.
you should be relieved, right? -- What is the matter with you people?
I mean, this is a good thing! He's alive, he's alive.
it's a real simple question. Okay?
I mean, are your bulletproof vests classified as uniform or as equipment?
why isn't it a simple question?
Yes. You wear it.
what... that's why it's called a vest.
hold on for one second. Sweets.
sweets, just give me one second.
I'll tell you what. Why don't you put on a bulletproof vest, I'll come down there and I'll shoot you. Right?
and then you can tell me if it's a uniform or equipment. Idiots.
all right, this better be good, 'cause I'm really in no mood.
did you just threaten to shoot someone? -- Kind of. What's up?
Sparling and I went to tell Robert Carlson's wife that her husband is dead, -- only the husband showed up. -- What?
the dead husband showed up. -- Alive.
bones made a mistake?
I know, it's even starting to sound weird to me.
you know what? Call the lab and see what they have to say.
will do. Uh... one other thing.
make it quick, okay? I have more people here I have to threaten.
Sparling doesn't seem to trust how I, as a psychologist, perform my job.
I don't know, she thinks you're an idiot?
I wouldn't say that, but in layman's terms... yes.
okay, look. You're the psychologist.
point your little shrinky brain at her and pull the trigger.
there's a lot of shooting talk coming from you today, huh?
right. So if I were you, I would take cover.
so, I've gone over every bit of this reconstruction, and I'm positive that it's correct.
unless the victim has an identical twin.
well, yeah, but... wouldn't that have come up in the investigation?
those aspects of the case are being handled by Sweets and a rookie agent.
then I'm totally blaming them.
I'm seeing some minute anomalies between the skull and Carlson's image.
remodeled fracturing to the right maxilla, the nasal spine, and the mandibular body.
Yeah. I should've seen that, huh?
no. They wouldn't have been discernible until the bones were cleaned.
you can still blame Sweets.
Thanks, honey. You're a good friend.
I'll adjust for the injuries.
okay. They're the same guy, but they're not the same.
identical twins. -- Yeah.
I didn't even know I had a brother.
I was adopted.
and he's dead now, so now I'll never get a chance to meet him.
we'll need the name of the adoption agency.
I'll get that for you.
who was he? I mean...
what was his name? Where did he live? What was his job?
that's something I think you might be able to help us with.
I don't see how.
there have been several convincing studies of identical twins, like yourself, who were separated as infants.
as adults, they tend to be remarkably similar.
are you serious about this? -- This is sort of my area, so...
this would explain these feelings I've always had of not being... complete.
it's strange. -- No, not at all.
separated twins often share the same political views, work in similar occupations, have the same behaviors, needs and compulsions.
you think you can figure out who he was from who I am?
I'm sure that's what Dr. Sweets hopes.
I'll have to ask my wife how much I can tell you.
she likes to have final say.
which may indicate that your twin also entered into a marriage that was dominated by...
a -- A deep sense of mutual respect.
I found some more remodeling, aside from that on the face.
left ribs six and seven, and both first metacarpals, were all fractured at approximately the same time.
Yes, I see.
the weapon was round, with a diameter of 66 millimeters.
a baseball bat. -- Very good, Dr. Saroyan.
but something else caused the fracturing to the metacarpals.
his thumbs were slammed in a drawer.
I think you might be correct. But how would you know that?
I was a coroner in New York. Either a loan shark or a bookie did this.
this guy probably was late with a payment.
guess how we are gonna track down that explosive?
a suppository? -- No. It's detonator wire.
and on that wire, a cockroach egg. -- Aren't those everywhere?
including our food and water. I'm sure we've each ingested several dozen cockroach eggs today.
Yeah, it's cool, huh? But this egg?
this egg is special. -- Ooh, yuck.
it's profoundly deformed. It must be an environmental marker.
Yes, this particular deformation is caused by exposure to large amounts of hydroprene.
it's an insecticide.
I'll have the FBI track down all the major suppliers of hydroprene in the region.
studies of separated twins shows that they share as much as 85% of key behavioral characteristics.
they cut their hair the same way, they eat the same food, they work in the same occupations, they share the same spiritual beliefs, and they've never even met each other.
are you saying that parenting doesn't really matter?
because it's a lot of work, if that's true.
Oh, no, no, no, no. You can't... you can't discredit good nurture.
but as the study shows, nature counts for a lot.
so what do you think?
Oh, I'm just waiting for a hit from the adoption agency.
we got a court order to get their records unsealed.
Yeah, Agent Sparling doesn't see the value in my approach.
Oh. Okay.
well, I input the key data points that you gave me so I could cross-reference Carlson's specific traits across multiple databases.
so we start big, right?
the two million American men born in 1966.
okay, see, so those tiny dots represent...
and from your look, I can see that you already figured that out, never mind.
june birthdays brings us down to 180, 000.
should I start questioning them? -- Not helpful.
Caucasian. 120, 000.
what was that? -- Taking out non-Caucasian.
piece of cake.
girl's got 'tude, huh? -- Yeah.
okay, this is where all the specific data that Sweets got from Carlson comes in.
that was really good specific data that you got, by the way.
Oh, well... We aim to please.
drivers of four-door sedans.
from there, I picked out people who got married while still in their 20s, belong to a church, excelled at track and field in high school, and who filed an insurance claim for asthma medicine within the last 18 months.
the final 48. -- Forty-eight.
run a visual comparison...
Jerry Langella. That's our guy.
way to go, Sweets.
are you working some sort of psychological mojo on me?
no. Why do you ask?
because I'm... I'm feeling a way I don't want to feel.
I'm feeling apologetic.
for what? -- Underestimating you.
dismissing you.
being condescending to you like that. -- Oh, yeah.
you didn't really bother hiding that at all.
look, what you did back there, winnowing down the victim pool, that's kind of incredible.
Oh, Angela helped. -- Take the compliment.
I will. Thank you.
it's got to be her. -- Wow, she looks just like Gina Carlson.
Yeah, I thought that might happen, what with your freaky twin thing.
you think she has the same sunny disposition?
you can take this one.
uh, Mrs. Langella? -- Yeah?
I'm Agent Sparling from the FBI and this is my associate, Dr. Lance Sweets.
FBI -- that can't be good. -- I'm afraid it's not.
your husband, Jerry Langella... is dead. -- Uh, uh, who killed him?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Langella. I need to ask, how do you know that your husband was murdered?
cause I'm not an idiot. You're the FBI.
it's not like you cover accidents or suicides.
what do you want from me?
do you know anyone that might have had a reason to kill your husband?
no, I thought I was the only one.
why would you want your husband to die?
clearly, you're not married.
where were you at 10: 35 this morning?
court-ordered community service.
Court-ordered? -- Road rage.
I got issues. Okay, you can check with my supervisor.
who beat up your husband a year ago?
his bookie.
son of a bitch gambled away everything we had and then some.
any idea where we can find the bookie?
she's in jail now.
how did you know about the beatings?
Oh, we know a lot, Mrs. Langella.
I wouldn't leave town if I were you.
what was that last little bit about?
just aiming my big shrinky brain at her.
thought you'd like to see what I was packing.
the military built this to test bomb blasts.
ready?
this should replicate the explosion exactly.
three, two, one!
that looks good!
I'll have to examine the exemplar bone to make sure.
Hey, let's see how something a little more substantial holds up against this bad boy.
where did you get the clothing?
I never really liked this shirt, so, hey, I'm happy to sacrifice it to science.
you are splattering body parts all over my lab.
they aren't actual body parts, Dr. Saroyan.
they are biofidelic surrogates.
we are utilizing this shock tube to recreate the effects the blast had on the victim's bones.
where did you get that?
Oh, Hodgins requisitioned it from the Hall of Patents.
Requisitioned? -- I left a note.
Dr. Hodgins, you promised.
I am confident that we can use this data to recreate the bomb.
come on. If we find the bomb, we find the bomber.
that thing goes back to the Hall of Patents in the same condition that you found it.
fire in the hole!
so the wife's alibi checks out.
her community service supervisor dropped her off on the side of the expressway for litter removal and picked her up three hours later.
Oh, you know what? She could have made it, you know, to the hotel and back. She on the tapes?
we haven't found her on them.
wait, wait, wait. You said that these twins married the same kind of woman?
Yeah, twins are often drawn to the same type of people. They share the same interests.
okay, so maybe whatever brought one twin to the hotel brought the other one there, too.
Carlson at the hotel?
no, I asked. He said he wasn't there.
Oh, right, right. People -- they never lie. I -- I forgot.
you know what? Just, now that you know what they look like, check the security tapes.
okay. Hello? Yeah, he usually hangs up without saying good-bye.
it's... It's our thing. It's 'cause we're close.
we're...
Hey, so you said the parking garage bomb was made from the explosive Propatrex, right?
Yeah, that I did.
well, your brilliant wife found a demolition company that stocks Propatrex, but that is not the best thing.
the demolition company is next to a hydroprene production faculty.
you found out where the explosives came from?
that I did.
Yeah, we had a break-in at the warehouse two weeks ago.
I filed a report. It's the regs.
what was stolen? -- A few Propatrex sausages and a detonator pack.
sausages? -- Here, I'll show you one.
it's okay. Propatrex is stable stuff. No worries.
so how many of these were taken? -- Four.
the bomb that killed our victim used approximately 40 ounces.
that would be three sausages.
great. That leaves one sausage we can't account for.
we need a list of everyone who had access to that warehouse.
I gave that list to the investigators already.
I was able to track Langella's movements through the hotel.
I used a frame analysis algorithm to search for men with a similar body type.
I got him in six different locations.
it could be either one of 'em. -- Yeah, well, that's what I thought, but look.
here he is at the elevators and here he is at reception.
now look at the time codes.
8: 23. Two places at the same time.
one is Carlson and the other is Langella.
both men were there, but they must have arrived at different times and not seen each other.
so Carlson lied. This is textbook.
look, they're even dressed alike.
there must have been something that brought them both together, you know? A shared interest. Wait.
is he wearing a name tag? Back that up a little.
can you zoom into that?
self-actualization Synergy.
Yeah, I know that group. They use new-agey self-help techniques and charge a bunch of money for it.
sounds like a cult.
all right, so they both have hardnosed wives, very domineering.
this promises personal freedom.
zoom in on Langella.
look, he's wearing the same kind of name tag.
I'll tell Agent Sparling. -- I'm sure you will.
what? -- Oh, nothing.
you know, it's possible to work with a woman without becoming romantically involved.
okay.
I am with Daisy. I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.
I notice you say, "I'm with Daisy" and not "I love Daisy."
Oh, come on. Can you please not use linguistic indicators that I taught you against me?
Oh, it's her, isn't it? -- It doesn't...
you should get it. Look, you're all red and blotchy and horny.
go ahead, answer it. You said you had to talk to her.
Hello, Agent Sparling.
Yes, Carlson was at the hotel. He lied.
great. You bring him in, and I'll meet you there.
uh, do you want me to pick up something like coffee or... ?
I know a place that makes a great latte.
latte? -- To keep us alert during the questioning, okay?
great, great. I'll see you then. All right, bye.
please don't look at me like that.
you're very blotchy. You're very red.
it's hot in here. I got to get the lattes.
you said you weren't at the hotel, Mr. Carlson. You lied.
can I say "lie," or is there some other term I should use?
"Pseudologia fantastica" is the technical term in this case, but whatever we call it, it's a federal crime to deceive the FBI in the course of a criminal investigation.
okay, okay, I lied.
you lied about knowing your brother, too, didn't you?
no. No, I swear. Look...
I lied because my wife hates me going to those symposiums. I didn't want her to find out.
the one for the Self-Actualization Synergy?
Yes. Yes, it's very important to me. It's changed my life.
by making you broke?
Ethan, he's the actualized master who started Synergy, he says that life's greatest gifts can never be free.
now I see why your wife was pissed.
your bother was also a seeker. He was at the symposium, too.
he was? -- Twins share much more than we think.
both of your wives are also very similar.
too bad for him then.
how much did you give this self-actualization group, Robert?
you can't put a price on living a fully actualized life.
ballpark, so we don't have to arrest you.
I was gonna give 'em... everything.
and move to their community in Colorado.
if Carlson's wife found out he was about to give everything away,
I mean, that can certainly be a motive for murder.
if that was my husband, I'd sure as hell want him dead.
I'll remember that. -- Oh, are we getting married now?
cause I didn't even know we were partners.
No! Oh, that was a joke. I didn't mean...
didn't Freud say there are no meaningless statements?
Freud, Freud, he's largely discredited now. He's a known cocaine addict.
he's not... I'm gonna go in and call Carlson's wife for questioning.
I suppose I could do a lot worse than you.
we... we should just, we should drop it.
I was sorting through the tissue samples.
these were scraped off the junction box in the garage.
that's not surprising.
the blast propelled body parts over a hundred feet in some directions.
but I found hair embedded in the tissue from a male.
not the victim? -- No.
the amount of hair and the height at which the tissue was found indicate that it struck someone in the head before it hit the junction box.
someone witnessed the blast.
since they didn't come forward, I'm thinking it's someone who caused the blast.
Dr. Saroyan.
I'm in the middle of something now.
sure, o -- okay. I'll be right there.
booth needs me. Some bureaucratic emergency.
that's sounds exciting. I'll check the junction box.
the steel has been stressed from the blast.
that's to be expected based on the force of the explosion.
but there's a warp to it.
Oh, run your beam over it again.
he was standing here when the shock wave hit him.
these dents were most likely caused by an impact with his skull.
probably with the lateral aspect of the super orbital margin and the zygomatic arch.
can you hold that?
midpoint is at 160 centimeters, which means our killer is between five-foot-nine and five-foot-11 inches tall.
average height. That's no help.
well, he had to have sustained further injuries from this blast.
but still managed to get away.
look, you got to help me. You do these budget presentations all the time.
what happened to Caroline?
she just came in here and she dumped all this stuff on me. Please?
well, she's not gonna like it if I do your presentation for you, Seeley.
and I can't; I'm not even FBI.
I'll deputize you. How's that? All right?
why did that not feel official?
look, please, you got to help me out here.
okay. I can give you a tutorial on the software.
no, no. I got to do it now, now.
they're -- they're right there in the other room.
waiting for me. In there, right now.
okay. Well, I can run the software for you, but this is your show.
okay, just help me get the raise, you know?
I'll be able to handle this when you're in the room.
14 days ago, you withdrew $20, 000 from your brokerage account.
Mrs. Carlson, we analyzed your computer's hard drive.
65 search engine hits for contract killers.
$20, 000 is about the going rate.
we're gonna be able to tie you to this murder.
now, it's not too late for you to do the right thing.
the right thing? Robert wanted to give that stupid cult everything.
how is that the right thing?
what was gonna happen to me?
he just kept saying he wanted to experience freedom and that he didn't care how much it cost.
you wound up killing an innocent man. -- That wasn't my fault.
the guy I hired got the wrong man. How is that my fault?
Seriously? -- Who did you hire?
I don't know his name. -- We know he's medium height, brown hair.
what else did you notice about him?
no, I -- I never met him. This was all set up online.
I left cash in a bag; half up front and half when the job was done.
did you give him the second half?
No! I'm no sucker. My husband isn't dead yet.
yet?
the guy said he would take care of Robert today.
Mrs. Carlson, where's your husband?
just remember, Booth, if you lose your place, just read what you see on the screen.
okay.
Gina Carlson hired a hit man, but he hit the wrong twin by mistake, so he's trying again.
when? -- Now.
Where's her husband? -- She thinks Dupont Plaza.
Yeah, okay, uh, get a team and bring them in.
Sparling's calling them right now. -- Call her husband.
I already tried. It went straight to voice mail.
the team's coming in from Edgewood. They're still 20 minutes out.
20 minutes? That's too long.
we're closer than they are. -- No, no, no.
Sparling and I could get there in five.
no, no, you guys aren't ready for this. I'm coming with you.
no, Booth. Aren't you forgetting something?
Oh, yeah, my gun. Thanks. You know what, I'll tell you what.
you are gonna do great. If you lose your spot, just read up on the screen. Let's go.
okay, how am I supposed to find him? There are tons of people here. Let's narrow this down.
we know that the killer is between five-nine and five-11.
okay, so he's not a giant or a small person. That doesn't help me out at all. What else?
brown hair, Caucasian. -- Brown hair, Caucasian?
come on, guys, narrow it down for me, will you?
Oh, uh, he was hurt. He hit a steel junction box.
where he was standing, the overpressure of the blast was at least 40 psi.
he probably fractured the neck of the malleus and dislocated the stapes.
booth his inner ear is messed up.
you're looking for a man with brown hair who's shaky and off-balance.
shaky and off-balance and he has a bomb?
um, I know who it is. I know who it is, Booth! It's Steve Keneally.
the foreman of the demolition company.
that's why the garage explosion was so perfect.
look, I think I spotted our guy.
Hey, listen, his explosives will be armed, so don't startle him.
tac team's six minutes out. -- Call Carlson.
hello. -- Mr. Carlson, it's Dr. Brennan.
Hey, Booth, Brennan has him.
tell him once he gets inside the ATM to keep the door shut.
Mr. Carlson, you have to get inside the ATM and hold the door shut.
someone is trying to kill you. -- What are you talking about?
the man who killed your brother is there with a bomb.
move now!
Keneally, FBI! Freeze!
stand back. All of you.
you know what's in here. You know what'll happen.
sir. Sir!
what?
you're in a dangerous situation. Please leave the area.
what? What did he say?
step back, sir. -- Oh, my God!
is someone in trouble? They have guns!
what's happening?
I got it.
it's only a flesh wound, Lance. Don't worry.
right. -- It's okay. You're gonna be fine.
don't look at me, you're the one who shot him.
Booth's with Keneally. He's taking his statement now.
how bad is it? -- Bad.
I have to face an internal review for shooting a civilian.
no, I meant me. -- You'll be fine.
they're saying the wound is mostly psychological.
uh, Agent Sparling -- Olivia...
I like you.
you're smart, you're really good at your job, you shot me and I don't -- I'm not even mad.
but I'm seeing someone.
it's serious.
doesn't take a psychologist to tell when a guy is taken.
that's why I'd never dream of doing this.
I heard it went well.
Yeah, dumb-ass hit man taken out with only minor casualties on our side, so you know what, we ended up ahead.
I was talking about the budget presentation.
the bean counters are actually increasing the budget. My boss is thrilled with me.
see that? Glad it worked out.
I bet you are. Too bad it wasn't you.
me? Well, we sent in a specialist. Only the best.
you know you're not getting that promotion now, right?
wait a second, why? I caught the bad guy. That's got to count for something.
well, it makes me all tingly, that's for sure, but that's it.
you're gonna have to settle with running around, shooting people until you grow up.
well, you wouldn't love me any other way, right?
you said there was a casualty; who was it?
sweets. He'll be fine.
sweets. That boy's got the goods.
but you better not tell him I said that. -- No problem.
as far as the world's concerned, you're a horrible person, cherie.
I knew I could count on you, cherie.
I'm sorry you're not getting the promotion.
Ah, thank you. -- You're welcome.
you know, for lying to me, thank you.
I mean, I know it's a white lie, but, I mean, look at you.
being all sweet and lying to me.
I didn't want you to get the promotion.
Why? Because I'm a man of action and not someone who's gonna rot behind a desk?
no, because who else would take me out into the field?
that's a good point, Bones.
but truthfully, I'm sorry that you're disappointed.
I'm not disappointed.
because you're a man of action who would rot behind a desk?
that's right. Man of action.
can I start buying you things now? -- No, you can't.
but, hey, I'll tell you what, you can buy Christine stuff.
I know you'd like a new grill.
Christine would love a new grill.
she would love it. -- Baby girls need grills.
they need grills and a new tool set.
what? What is this? -- It's a quinoa.
Queenoa? -- Quinoa.
what is that? -- It's a grain.
there's a lot of protein. -- Interesting.
when I get the new grill, we can cook steaks. -- What's that mean?
stop!
great, nice job. Now you're just getting us more stuck.
this is your fault. - You were yelling at me.
that's why you weren't looking at the road.
how is that my fault?! - See?! Right there!
you're doing exactly what Dr. Wiseman said. You're deflecting. Nothing is ever your fault!
for the love of all that is holy, can we please fight about this when we're not stuck in a ditch?
symbolic accident. That's all I'm saying.
let's just get out of here. Just rock it, and when I say, give it the gas.
don't order me around!
all right, rock it!
Yeah! Good!
all right, rock it!
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, more!
Yeah! Step on it!
stop! Stop!
stop the car!
is this real or are you just trying to get attention? - No, something shot down my throat.
here, give me a hand.
come on. Why do they even bother printing the whole paper?
why can't they just have one page that just says everything is horrible everywhere?
there's an interesting op-ed piece about the deadlock in the House Appropriations Committee.
that sounds like a fun morning read. So what are you doing there?
should I run for president?
I believe every American should consider what is his or her greatest contribution to the common good.
right. And yours would be running for president? - I'm brilliant.
that is not in dispute. I have a profound depth of knowledge of the evolution of government from early Mesopotamian city states to the Ching Dynasty to Moorish caliphates, the laws of Ur-Nammu and Hammurabi...
Whoo! Go figure. You can't run for President of the United States, Bones.
well, not this election cycle, obviously.
but look what I have on my "pro" list.
excellent understanding of the criminal justice system.
because of our work together. And I have an impressive conviction rate, too.
Oh, "Empathy with the struggles of the working class." - I worked several minimum wage jobs while on the run.
I'm actually thinking of a tax plan...
you sort of just glossed over "on the run." You know, you were a fugitive.
Where's that? That's not on the list. I was cleared.
well, after evading arrest for three months. Give me the pen-- fugitive, con.
are you saying that you think I would be a bad candidate?
because Donald Trump was thinking of running.
Yeah, okay, we are on our way. We are up.
body in a ditch.
I hope you'll be more supportive if our daughter decides to run for president.
well, we'll cross that bridge when she starts walking, okay?
so, the cop here, he tells me that this couple here, they were arguing and they ran off the side of the road.
I would suspend the licenses of reckless drivers. Current laws are much too lenient.
you're making laws now? - She wants to be president.
Oh. Excellent.
see? - Yeah.
Dr. Hodgins, is there any way to clear the insects off of the remains?
I know. I am trying.
where happened to the anterior portion of the victim's skull?
the tire was right on the head when they were trying to get out of the mud.
the wheels spun, tore off most of the face and sprayed it everywhere.
our friend over there wound up catching a face full of face.
primary cranial structure indicates a male Caucasian in his late 20s.
I've never seen a Presidential candidate I. D. remains before.
I tell you, you should put that on your "pro" list. - Dr. Hodgins?
Oh, thank you. Okay, with that.
Hey, check it out! Bug rapture.
sorry. This just makes me so happy. Look at 'em go!
okay, okay.
Compression-force trauma extends from his coccyx to his cranium, stopping at the frontal bone.
getting crushed by the car may have something to do with that, Bones. Just, you know...
so how long has he been in the ditch?
well, the moisture from the mud makes it difficult to tell.
but as soon I get back to the lab, my six- and eight-legged friends here will give us an exact time.
the witness isn't feeling well.
he said he swallowed something when he was sprayed with person.
his stomach acid could be destroying evidence. - Sprayed with person? Hold on-- Bones...
excuse me. My name is Dr. Temperance Brennan.
I understand you may have swallowed some of the remains.
no. It felt like a rock. - Okay, should we get him back to the Jeffersonian?
not necessary.
please open wide and say "ah."
Wow. What did you give him? - Ipecac syrup. It induces regurgitation.
a leader has to be decisive, Booth.
I certainly wasn't going to wait for him to pass it-- tooth.
he swallowed a tooth. - You lost my vote.
thank you.
significant damage to the capitate, the hamate and styloid process of the third metacarpal.
the radiating splintering is suggestive of a high velocity strike, most likely a gunshot wound.
1. 6 centimeters in diameter.
if it was a bullet, it was probably from a nine-millimeter fired at very close range.
shot in the hand. Torture, maybe?
look at that crown on the third molar in the fourth quadrant of the mandibular arch.
based on discoloration, it's unlikely to be more than five years old.
it's the only clean tooth in the bunch.
the lingual surface to the first molar is fractured down to the dentin.
there are two fillings in disrepair and heavy calculus buildup at the gum line.
why fix one tooth but not the others?
when I am president, I will introduce a bill which will allow every American to get good dental care.
it will involve a simple five-tier system balancing variable efficiency measurements and parametric funding models.
Ah, finally.
what is this?
what is that?
newspaper.
Yeah, he was wearing boots that were much too big for him.
bad teeth, bad boots. Our victim came from a lower caste.
we don't have castes in America. - Wow. Would you care to look me in the face and say that?
Oh, God, did this just morph into a racial thing?
blowfly larvae indicate time of death to be between five and eight days ago.
and the date on this newspaper is from six days ago.
these treads are really jammed with evidence.
I might be able to tell you the last place this guy walked.
I see nothing giving us cause of death yet.
shallow grave at the side of the road, gunshot wound...
I'm gonna throw caution to the wind here and call it a suspected homicide.
Hey.
well? - Well, it's ours.
we officially live together.
I've never lived with a man before. - Me neither.
you're so funny.
laughter is gonna be the main sound in our apartment. And sex.
hopefully, not at the same time.
okay, so the little one is the mailbox in the lobby.
and the kitty...? - ...is the front door, monkey is the deadbolt.
and... Oh, here is the clicker for the garage.
I've never had a clicker before!
I gotta go! - What about your lunch?
uh, what's mine is yours. I'll see you at home tonight.
at home tonight.
Oh, I'll get some wine and sparklers. Then we can really celebrate.
Oh, it's on.
how am I supposed to reconstruct a face with a big hole in it?
do everything but the hole?
way ahead of you, smarty-pants.
booth asked me to do some approximates.
these look great. - Stop humoring me.
how are you doing?
I'm having trouble, too.
I mean, all I found is buckshot, spun sugar, animal feces, fragments of stained glass and common limestone gravel, which tells me that our victim was at some kind of county fair-type place before he was killed.
Wow. That's quite a lot.
Yeah. Plus the purple in this glass, right?
it's manganese oxide. It's rarely used to color glass today.
now see these little imperfections?
these are manmade by localized heat treatments.
that's a method that was perfected in Venice.
the Venetian glass, I get. - Yeah. So I do a fast search, right?
and I found that there's an antique show, which advertised "hundreds of authentic Venetian glass from the turn of the century" which was here last week, - because where else would a day laborer step on Venetian glass? - This is you "having trouble"?
Oh, my God, you just looked at me with pity.
no... Ange, come on. We're a team, right?
high tides lift all boats?
okay.
Yeah, that's gonna come back to bite me later.
Dr. Sweets? - Hey!
what are you doing in the bone room?
uh, towels. Daisy was torn between thread counts, so she wanted me to take a look at these.
and she couldn't send you a link? - Yeah. That's what I suggested.
but apparently you can't feel the Internet.
and there's no medio-cam to check the thread count, so...
of course. Yeah. It's quite overwhelming moving in together, huh?
Oh, it's great. I mean, all I had was an old chair, a TV, video games...
my towels were old and ratty.
so, I get it. Not a pretty picture.
no. But now I get the woman's touch, you know?
a full set of silverware, ottoman, something called a duvet.
I always thought that men hated all that stuff.
are you kidding me? No, we love it.
when we miss living like pigs, we go camping. - I'll have to remember that.
Yeah.
I wish you and Ms. Wick much happiness with your new towels.
how could you not be happy with these? Feel this one.
feel it. - Okay.
okay, this is nice.
right? - Nice.
Yeah. Hey.
question. Is it hard for women moving in with a man?
is that why you said I'd hate this? - Oh, no need to get all shrinky, Dr. Sweets.
sorry. Never mind.
but, actually, when I moved in with Michelle's father, there were times that I didn't want to compromise, I think.
sort of like I missed my old ratty towels.
but I didn't have these. These are awesome.
they are. Can't wait till Daisy shows me under the medio-cam.
I'll bet.
well, I should get back to work.
enjoy.
I will. Thank you.
well, not much here, Bones.
Hodgins says that two days before the victim died, this area was home to cotton candy, uh, shotgun pellets, camels and this gravel, so I'm confident this is the place.
shotgun pellets?
Yeah. Gun show two days before the antique show.
you know, this would be an excellent venue for a political rally. - I don't know, Bones.
it'd be kind of embarrassing if the turnout wasn't too strong.
Oh, it'd be strong.
okay. - Don't you worry about it being strong.
okay. Okay. Uh, you and you.
that's all I need today, guys. Hey. Hey, come on, guys, I'm sorry.
just come back in a couple of days before the car show, okay?
come on! Okay, you two.
okay, start over there. Work your way back here, okay?
Thanks, Juan. You got it. - Yeah, no worries.
Hi. - Hi.
well, something tells me you two aren't here looking to pick up some unskilled labor.
no, no, we are both extremely skilled.
I'm very skilled. FBI-skilled, pal.
you're looking to see if I'm hiring illegals? Because I'm not.
these are all people who lost their jobs, you know-- legal citizens.
tough times. - Some days, I think I'm going to get mobbed for minimum wage work, man.
under my administration, the private sector will receive incentives to increase hiring.
bones, let's just... no campaigning while we're doing the investigation, okay?
okay.
we think that one of your minimum wage workers might have been killed.
wow, man. Who?
I don't know. You missing anyone? - It's a pretty fluid bunch.
I'm their last resort, you know. Do you recognize any of these men?
that one could be Jared.
uh, Andrews.
no, no, um... Jared Drew.
okay, what can you tell us about Mr. Drew? - He's been coming around for a year or so.
good worker. Never complained, always looking for more.
sometimes intense competition for limited resources results in violence. - What?
what she means is minimum wage workers... I mean, any of them likely to go after the competition?
wait, wait-- Jared was murdered? - Yeah.
I don't know. I mean, uh, maybe.
Yeah, thing is, I don't really get to know these guys. - Because they are below you on the social scale.
no. Wait a second there. I feel bad sending them away.
I get to know them as people, that's why I feel bad.
I mean, look at them. I only have work for two.
what about all the other guys?
the victim's name is Jared Drew. He was a day laborer.
he used to have his own business? - Yeah, owned a hardware store.
he lost everything in the crash.
suddenly he's competing for minimum wage, unskilled jobs.
bones and I just got back from the fairgrounds. You should have seen this.
there were 20 workers raising their hands for two jobs to pick trash-- garbage.
does Dr. Brennan have a plan for the economy?
okay, Sweets, let's not encourage her.
I don't know. You know, she's very smart. Maybe she's exactly what this country needs.
Oh, yeah, 'cause she was wanted for murder, she took peyote with the Indians, and her dad was a hard-core criminal.
I don't think I should start printing up "Bones for President" campaign buttons any time soon.
it's Daisy. She's smiling and looking happy.
what's the big deal? - We're moving in together.
she's, uh... she's putting together a little celebration.
sweets, the case. Victim.
all right, has no criminal record, but check this out, huh?
right there.
restraining order filed two days before the murder by Marcy Drew?
his ex-wife.
how is your reconstruction coming, Ms. Wick?
I hope you'll be pleased, Madam President.
Dr. Brennan is fine. - For now.
I found arthritic markers on his knuckles and wrists that predate the gunshot wound.
it's in the nascent stages and...
...asymmetrical.
a day laborer should present symmetrical wear to his joints.
there are over 100 types of arthritis, Ms. Wick.
I'll examine the cell structure to see what we're dealing with.
how will you deal with the CIA? That would be a problem for me.
I can't keep a secret.
you must realize that espionage is a crucial tool for diplomacy as well as national defense.
but you wouldn't tap my phone or anything.
a campaign must be designed to persuade the electorate that the candidate is on their side.
which means it is sometimes necessary to lie. So my answer is...
no, I would not tap your phone.
you did an excellent job of reconstructing the skull, Ms. Wick.
I know.
and it seems as if we have cause of death-- because of me.
chiseling shows the bullet path was through the frontal sinus and exited through the right superlateral occipital.
the entry wound and surrounding damage measure 1. 828 centimeters.
that would suggest a .45-caliber bullet.
but Dr. Saroyan said that the gunshot to the hand was probably from a nine-millimeter.
two guns. Which means we're likely looking for two killers.
this is terrible. I never wanted anything like this to happen to Jared.
but you did file a restraining order against him. - He was coming around all the time.
he wouldn't leave Marcy alone.
you were listed in the restraining order, as well, Mr. Young. - Yeah.
okay. - Jared was getting aggressive.
that had to stop. - I don't think that Jared would have hurt us, Mike.
you want to take a chance like that?
preemptive action. You can never go wrong with a little preemptive action.
you seem angry.
Jared was coming around all the time begging me to take him back.
Marcy's with me now. Okay? I'm taking care of her.
I'm taking care of the kids. All right, Jared's life with her is over.
certainly is now.
was he ever violent with you or the children?
Jared? Oh, God, no, no.
no, he was just... - He was a loser.
he upset the kids.
that hardware store was passed down from Jared's grandfather.
and-and trying to hang onto it, we lost our condo and every penny we had.
he couldn't find any work?
he tried to get on with one of the big home improvement stores, but...
he would have had to move away from the kids.
and since you and Mike here were already together... - Who told you that?
uh, you did, just now. Obviously, you feel guilty about leaving your husband.
ex-husband. - He was a good man.
he was a good provider until he lost that store.
I had to think of my kids.
right. You know, often, though, people feel the need to get rid of whatever it is that makes them feel guilty.
no, that's not it.
do either of you own a gun?
I would like a lawyer. - Me, too.
not another word without a lawyer.
Dr. Saroyan, have you seen the excrement that I left on my desk?
think before you speak, Hodgins.
some people might not understand what you're referring to.
Oh. That's a good point. So, have you seen it?
Yes, I took your excrement. I wanted to study it.
now everything sounds terrible, doesn't it? - Awful.
I wasn't finished cataloguing what the animal ate. - You'll have plenty of time.
I wanted to get my hands on the ex...
evidence to see if it contained epithelial cells.
apparently, she hit the mother lode.
the epithelial cells came from a variety of exotic animals.
so far, I've found monkey cells, cougar and digested wolf cells.
Yeah, and all the animals were at a pet expo.
Jared Drew had work there, mucking out the, uh, holding pens.
have your bugs given you time of death yet?
Yeah, six days ago. - Oh, that was during the pet expo.
this must have been his last job.
Oh, man.
turns out these expos aren't just for puppies and kittens anymore.
exotic pets are a $10 billion a year industry. - You're exaggerating, right?
no, there are more pet tigers in Texas than there are in the wilds of India.
what kind of lunatic wants a wild animal as a pet?
I think "lunatic" pretty much describes who we're talking about.
I'm sorry. I don't know him.
he worked at your pet expo. - Doing what?
cleaning up. - Oh, I don't hire the day laborers; the fairground does that.
what kind of people come to these things? - Oh, awful people, really.
families, retired people. - Antique shows, they draw stolen goods.
gun shows draw illegal weapons. - Okay, yeah, I can see where this is going.
we don't do any traffic in illegal exotics.
my pet expo is not only in compliance with every local and federal law, but it is also approved by eight animal rights organizations.
it is a family event. - No, cougars and bears are not for families.
they are legal.
the vendors breed them right here in the U. S. Nothing illegal about it.
these animals aren't domesticated. It is cruel to treat them as pets.
well, some would say that it's horrible to watch a lion taking down a zebra, tearing it apart and eating it.
these animals are spared that fate.
look, I came here to help, not to be attacked for doing something perfectly legal.
all right, simmer down, Bwana Bob. - I comply with the law.
now, is there anything else, or do you just intend to berate me because we see the world differently?
I believe you will be very impressed when I tell you that this arthritis isn't really arthritis.
I'd be more impressed if you told me what it is instead of what it isn't.
beginning stages of osteonecrosis.
see here? On the ulna at the styloid process.
and here, more damage at the olecranon process.
what causes that? Blood poisoning? - Exactly.
and when sepsis makes its way into bone, it presents as septic arthritis.
what caused the blood poisoning? - Point of entry was here.
see the linear striations on the victim's right lunate and trapezium?
Ouch. Those cuts are pretty deep, almost like he was slashed.
scratching the victim down to bone, and inserting the bacteria directly into the victim's bloodstream.
what kind of person doesn't go to the hospital after an injury like that?
a very poor person? - He could've gone to the emergency room.
either he couldn't get to a hospital, or he was prevented.
let's see if Hodgins can take some samples and figure out what slashed him.
I'm just saying that you're more important in the lab than I am.
is this some kind of test?
I give them faces, which, more and mo is just not the way to identify victims, and then, sometimes, I show how they died.
that is very important, Angie.
God help me, if you get into that "All boats rise in a flood" thing...
high tide raises all boats.
Yeah. What? - You said flood-- a flood is a natural disaster.
what? Most boats would sink in a flood. Tide's good, flood's bad.
Seriously? - Ask New Orleans.
I'm telling you that I'm feeling inadequate, and you're talking about boats.
I mean, it's totally...
Hey, Sweets! Hey! Come here.
save Hodgins' life. - Hey.
uh... don't you want to finish your...your fight?
whoa, Sweets thinks we were having a fight. - Yeah, well, he clearly doesn't know what a fight is.
I gotta go. I'm gonna go figure out how our victim's hand got slashed. I love you.
Hey. Sit down.
are you okay? - Yeah. Why?
if I were a psychologist,
I'd say that you overreacted to the slightest disagreement between me and Hodgins.
because I'm at a turning point in my own relationship.
I was gonna say that maybe you're nervous about moving in with Daisy.
no, I've... yeah, well, I'm a little nervous. - You're getting cold feet.
No! Why would I?
it's... It's not like we're getting married. Moving in together is-is...
you know, it's a minor commitment. - Minor.
Oh, boy. - What?
is it possible that maybe what you're seeing as a minor commitment, Daisy is seeing as...
the beginning of a whole new life together.
Yeah. - Yeah...
it's like you never studied psychology at all.
Yeah.
you found something? - Yeah. Keratin.
from a claw? - Feline.
he was slashed by a cat? - Yeah, but not the kind that you're thinking.
don't be so sure.
DNA results from the epithelial cells you found in the victim's boot tread.
okay, if you say tiger, then we are on the same page.
a Siberian tiger. - Wait-- a pure-bred Siberian tiger?
according to the DNA. Does the type of tiger make a difference?
Yeah, see, buying and selling cross-bred tigers is legal...
but a pure-bred Siberian tiger, I mean, that's...
that's a felony. - Definitely motive for murder.
well, it's only murder if we can find cause of death. - I found cause of death.
I should've seen this earlier. I was a coroner in New York.
wait-- seen what earlier?
Dr. Brennan said that the splintering showed that the bullet entered through the palm and exited through the back of the hand...
yeah?
shoot me.
I beg your pardon? - No-- with the marker. Shoot me.
um... okay, bang
it was a defensive wound.
the bullet went through the victim's hand and then into his face.
a hollow-point bullet. It expanded entering the hand.
that's why we thought a nine-millimeter entered his hand and a .45-caliber entered his face.
one bullet, one gun, one shooter.
our victim is attacked by a pure-bred Siberian tiger.
the wounds he sustained gave him blood poisoning, but he did not seek medical help-- why?
that's what I'm asking you.
because if he tells the hospital that he was attacked by a Siberian tiger, he ends up in prison, right?
okay, the body was found here, on the north side of the road.
the road dead-ends in this valley. - There's five farms there.
so, if the body was found on the north side of the road, he was heading out.
after delivering the tiger. - Right.
okay, so maybe the buyer of the tiger sees the victim's wound, realizes he's gonna have to go to the hospital...
no, no, no, no, that's too risky, okay? Buying a tiger is a felony, Sweets.
right, right, so, maybe...
the buyer offers to drive the victim to the hospital, kills him along this deserted stretch of road.
you should search those five farms for a tiger. - I don't have enough for a warrant, okay?
that's why you're here.
I don't understand. - I need you to put together some kind of psychological mumbo-jumbo warrant for these five farmers.
booth, I'm a professional, okay? I can't just make things up, so you can get a warrant.
you're not helping me. You... you're not.
wouldn't it make more sense if I talked to the guy that runs the pet expo?
I mean, maybe one of these farmers is known to be an animal collector.
that's a good idea. - Thank you.
you know what? He's in the interrogation room, okay?
you have at him. Gotta go.
you just... you just totally conned me into doing that.
booth! - Yeah.
can I ask you a personal question? - Well, that depends on how personal here.
okay, um... was it a big deal for you to move in with Dr. Brennan?
what do you mean?
you know, big deal, like... getting married.
whoa-- living together is not getting married, okay? Getting married's a big-boy commitment.
okay, yes, yes. I totally agree with that.
for me. But, for Bones, that was a...
that was a huge step, you know? Living together.
the only reason she even considered it was because she was pregnant.
okay, so...
Dr. Brennan's the most rational human being on the planet...
and, to her, moving in together...
big deal.
big. - Huge.
huge. Huge.
breathe it out, kid. You'll get him. - Okay.
none of these names mean anything to me. Who-who are they?
we have reason to believe that one of them bought a Siberian tiger on the black market.
Oh, here we go again.
Mr. Neibling, the victim worked at the fairgrounds during the time of your pet exposition, all right?
he was injured by a Siberian tiger.
maybe one of these, one of these farmers made suspicious inquiries.
10, 000 people came through that expo.
we had over 200 exhibitors.
an innocent man is dead; we're just exploring every avenue.
if he was transporting a pure-bred Siberian tiger, then he was not innocent.
okay, but he didn't deserve to die. - I'm not sure I agree with that.
these smugglers, they don't care about the animals, and they interfere with my legitimate business.
now, what happens if the press finds out that you're questioning me?
my reputation goes right into the toilet. - We won't leak your name to the press.
all right, well, let me take the names. I'll ask around.
if I hear anything suspicious, I'll get back to you.
good. Thank you, sir. I appreciate your help.
I love farms. Someday, Lance and I will have a farm of our own.
the pet expo guys didn't recognize any of the farmers' names.
Yeah, but what are the chances that a guy is gonna buy a Siberian tiger with his real name, anyway?
Oh! Oh! I could call in an anonymous tip like: I hear roaring at night.
I was thinking more along the lines of looking at satellite photos on the Internet, and seeing if any of the farms shout tiger!
that is brilliant. - Okay, here they are.
kinda grainy. - Yeah, well, this is just what the government allows us to see on the Internet.
you know they keep all the good stuff for themselves. - Could those be endangered animals?
are blobs endangered? - Let me try a fractal enlargement program.
I'm guessing cows.
pigs! Which are not endangered. Unless you factor in bacon.
are those cages? - Yeah... they could be.
"could be" will not get us a warrant.
Yeah, and these images haven't been updated in over a year.
what we need is our own satellite.
Oh! We've got one!
all of Neibling's permits are up to date
there's no citations, no violations, he even got an "A" rating from the Better Business Bureau.
legality notwithstanding, why would someone willingly keep these animals as pets?
people who live where these creatures are indigenous, take great lengths to keep these animals away from their homes.
look, I'm with you, man. You want to see a wild animal, go to the zoo.
Oh... I do not like zoos.
what do you mean? It's a zoo.
keeping animals captive for human entertainment is just wrong.
come on! Don't ruin the zoo for me. I used to go with papa.
I have great memories there. I can't wait to take Christine.
no, that will not be happening. - It's educational, okay?
what, if she doesn't go to the zoo, how's she gonna learn about the animals?
the satellite system you insisted that we buy provides us with 16 animal-themed channels.
one, just for penguins. - It's not the same, okay?
the TV won't give you a balloon.
the balloons end up in the ocean, and very often choke seals.
okay, all right, you know what?
find something bad to say about the kitty train they have.
burns fossil fuels just to go round and round in circles.
cotton candy. - Encourages Type 2 diabetes.
I could do this all day, Booth.
fine, fine. Just know that someday, we are getting a dog for Christine.
hm. Possibly.
studies have shown that children who grow up with dogs have stronger immune systems.
and you can play ball with them. - If you say so.
I do say so. And you know what? We're gonna name him Gretzky.
well, we'll see about that. - Yeah, it's Gretzky.
here, Gretzky! Gretzky boy! Come on, boy!
I am using a World War II Spitfire, so... I don't have a lot of range.
and I thought you didn't have a lot of range 'cause you're using a toy.
a hobbyist does not play with toys, he works with replicas.
all right, so, you getting the signal?
Yeah, yeah, and I like the replica, sweetie.
it's awesome. - Fine. I'm the bad guy.
all right, here we go.
Ooh, we're getting a good signal.
a goat... more pigs...
lots of cows...
try to limit the play-by-play to the exotic animals, Ms. Wick.
well, I grew up in the city, so they're all exotic to me.
can you get any higher?
it's a Spitfire.
cages! - Can you get up under those trees?
what are those?
a camel! Zebra!
is that a wolf? - A kangaroo!
you know, Booth can tell a judge that we got this video from a hobbyist.
this is definitely enough to get us a warrant.
Oh, no, no, no...!
thomas Casey, FBI! - Casey, open up!
we have a warrant!
booth, the cages are over here but... I don't see a tiger.
bones, wait up. Bones!
there's a wolf, a kangaroo, a zebra... - All legal, Bones.
the state doesn't even require them to be registered.
Really? You have to register for a dog but not a wolf?
it's horrible, Booth. None of these animals should be kept like this.
if only you were president, Bones.
Hey! Hey, hey! - If only.
what are you doing? You can't be here.
whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there, okay?
FBI. We have a warrant.
for what? I haven't done anything wrong. - What about these animals?
they're not meant to be kept as pets. - Hey, all these animals are legal.
well, we're here about your Siberian tiger. - I don't know what you're talking about.
you see a tiger? Because I don't.
what I see is an empty cage over there. - You waiting for something?
I hope I can find a chimp. - Chimp?
Oh, my God.
what? - Carrion birds.
what? That's bad.
go. Go!
go! Go!
you shot it! You killed it!
I had to; it was out of control, trying to get out and go for the other animals.
whoa, easy. You shot your own tiger?
how could... How could he do that? How could you do that?!
easy, easy! Relax.
all right, easy, easy, easy, easy.
okay, it's all right.
it's gonna be okay, Bones. Don't worry about it.
what I want to know is how many things we can charge him with.
well, we got him killing an endangered species. - Does that carry the death penalty?
$50, 000 fine, a year in jail.
when I am president, killing tigers will be a death penalty offense.
well, the president isn't actually a dictator, Bones. - That's right.
I'll have to convince two other branches of the government to execute animal traffickers.
you know what, you're very persuasive when you set your mind to something.
that animal was beautiful.
it was beautiful and rare, just like you.
you should leverage the tiger buyer into ratting out whoever he bought the tiger from.
sorry, did you hear what I said? It was very sweet.
maybe we can bring down the entire criminal organization.
right, let's do that. Let's bring them all down.
I shot that tiger in self-defense.
it was a man-killer. - You're lying.
we are charging you with murder. - For the tiger?!
no, for Jared Drew. - Who is Jared Drew?
he's the poor bastard who delivered the tiger to your farm.
he's dead? Yes, he's dead.
that guy was really sick. He could barely stand up.
he probably died of whatever disease he had.
we think that you offered to drive him to the hospital.
killed him on the way. - And then buried him at the side of the road.
I didn't drive him anywhere.
he was too sick to drive himself. You said it yourself.
he didn't have to drive himself. There was the other guy.
other guy? What other guy?
two of them brought me the tiger. - What did the other one look like?
I don't know. He waited in the truck. I never got a good look.
Yeah, well, we're still charging you with murder. - But I didn't kill anyone.
Yeah, but purchasing that tiger and transporting it over a state line, that's a felony.
someone dies in the commission of that felony, everyone involved is guilty of homicide, pal.
right there, that's why, when I'm president, you get appointed to head up the FBI.
there we go. Thank you.
who was the man in the truck? - I don't know.
I'll tell you everything I do know.
you write down that I cooperated.
sure, go ahead.
I'm looking online for cool animals for my collection, five clicks later, there's somebody wants to sell a Siberian tiger.
you bought it online?
siberian tiger available. Serious inquiries only.
no names.
just a e-mail telling me to meet a guy named Juan at the fairground, give him half the money in an envelope.
I only took an envelope from the guy. I didn't even know what was inside.
come on, Juan. You know what an envelope full of cash feels like.
you took the money and then delivered a tiger.
a tiger? The money was for a tiger?
the envelope full of cash, who did you give it to?
Mr. Neibling. - Eric Neibling?
I don't know his first name, man. It's Mr. Neibling, the boss.
I give him the envelope, he gives me 50 bucks.
he asks me to send him a good worker, he gives me another $50.
you sent him Jared Drew. - Poor guy, man.
all he wanted was to make enough money and hold his head high with his wife and kids.
you know what, this makes complete sense to me now.
you saw the buyer's name on the list that we gave you.
so what do you do? You call him up, you say, "Quick, get rid of the tiger" .
show me the phone records you've got to prove that. I thought so.
something wrong with you? You need a glass of water?
I got a stomach bug or something. - He's sick.
what you have is nascent osteonecrotic septicemia.
blood poisoning. - You got it when you shot Jared Drew in the face.
right, from the blowback. - I got the sniffles from shooting someone?
come on, do you know how much face time I have with the public?
he has to have a fragment of the victim's bone somewhere in him. - How big?
a sliver, probably in his face. - You know what? I think I'm gonna leave.
whoa, you're not going anywhere. His face looks fine to me.
sit down. Sit. - Where else does blowback hit?
put your hands on the table.
I want a lawyer. - You're gonna need one.
put your hands on the table.
right-handed.
right hand holds the gun.
if I went to the hospital and they found out about the tiger, I would've been ruined.
look at that, huh?
you traded in 50 grand and a year in jail for the death penalty.
Lance! - Hey.
welcome home.
why didn't you go in? - I thought we'd go in together.
is this your place? - Yeah.
Oh, wow, it looks great. - Yeah.
we'd invite you in but... - Oh, that's okay.
we'll have a housewarming party when we're settled.
you should carry her over the threshold. Girls love that stuff.
Oh, don't bother.
I had a lump on my head for weeks and he threw out his back.
Threshold-carrying is kind of a marriage thing, and we're not actually... - We will do it.
lance is so strong.
okay, well, we'll leave you to it.
Yeah, yeah. - All right.
see you guys.
I'm not doing it.
I'll wrap my arms around your neck and hang on.
it will be easy. - No, I'm...
I'm not going into the apartment. - Oh, why?
because I-I underestimated the meaning.
which is ironic 'cause, you know, I'm trained to discern nuance.
stop talking like that.
when were you thinking we'd get married? - I don't know.
a year maybe. Sooner if I get pregnant.
you want to get married before we live together. That's fine.
my answer is yes. - No, no, no, no. I'm...
I'm not thinking about getting married at all. - But we're moving in together.
um, I misconstrued the significance.
I got it all wrong.
I'm so sorry.
first month's rent and last month's rent is paid.
so you have two months to figure out what you want to do.
we're not moving in together?
we're breaking up.
I'm...
I'm really sorry.
I really am.
Caroline offered to drop the charges to second degree murder if Neibling gave us the names of suppliers.
good. I hope Caroline puts all of them in little cages.
right.
did you know that Abraham Lincoln was a bartender? Grover Cleveland was a hangman.
andrew Johnson was a tailor. - Well, I'm sure you would be the smartest president.
I'm not sure.
James Garfield could simultaneously write Latin with one hand and Greek with the other.
that's just a trick. - So now you think I'd be a good president?
um, no, I don't. You know you're an atheist, you're not diplomatic, and you think America is an empire.
america is an empire.
and I really, really wouldn't give you your own army or nuclear weapons.
that would just be a disaster. - Because I'm like a tiger?
excuse me?
earlier today, you said I reminded you of a wild tiger.
I did. You do.
you called me rare and beautiful. Like a tiger, you said.
I thought you didn't hear.
wild tigers do not have the qualities of a good president.
you know what, Bones,
I wouldn't vote for you, but I would definitely encourage other people to vote for you.
that's irrational.
Yeah, well, so is politics and love.
I think you're trying to convey that you no longer would like to discuss politics.
unless we're talking about JFK and Marilyn Monroe.
booth, what are you doing? Where are you touching?
you gotta sing something else, Louie. Some Kanye, Cee Lo...
there's nothing but opera, my friend.
the neighbors complain.
dogs bark, the kids throw rocks, man.
if you tried it, you'd love it.
opera's the music of the soul!
no, hey. Soul is the music of the soul, Louie.
you can do it. You've heard it enough.
- No, no!
okay, all right.
but then you're singing some Kanye.
it's a little flat, but that's the spirit.
I'm busy. - Come on, Sweets, open up.
Oh... I'm-I'm in the middle of work, Booth.
no, you're not. I can see you right through the window. Get up.
open up the door, Sweets, let's go.
okay. - Come on, come on.
wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.
there you are, my friend.
Ah, Sweets, you can't keep sleeping in your office like this.
you didn't have to bring me coffee.
the coffee's mine, but I did print up some apartment listings for you.
take a look. This place is a mess, huh?
Oh... I can't believe you gave Daisy the apartment.
you know I broke up with her.
I can't... take the apartment, too.
come on! Man, look at you.
you gotta shake it off. Right?
get a new girlfriend, get a new place to live.
Yeah, thanks.
I'll check these out.
you've been sleeping in this office for two weeks.
you're gonna go cuckoo.
and if anyone knows what cuckoo is, that would be you, Mr. Sweets.
okay, maybe I'm dealing with a few things that are preventing me from moving on as quickly as I could.
you know, a breakup like this makes one reevaluate...
work calls. The dead waits for no man.
okay.
Yeah, okay, let's get back to work.
all right, I'll tell you what, Sweets.
why don't you just come and... stay at our place for a night or two?
Really? - Yeah.
so you can clear your mind, you know, get ready for your next move.
thank you.
clear my mind.
here, have the coffee. You're back. Come on.
let's go, Sweets. - I'm coming.
you invited Sweets to move in with us?
I know I should have asked you first, but you should have seen him.
he was pitiful. I mean, it was bad.
you know, it's just for a couple of days, until he finds his own place.
okay.
was that an "okay" okay or a "you can't be serious" okay?
I don't know what that means.
it means that we're talking about psychology Sweets, here, you know, the guy drives you crazy.
he's going through a difficult time.
it takes a village, Booth.
I learned that living in a village.
sweets will be gone in a couple days. I promise, okay?
gone? Gone where? Is he okay?
booth invited Sweets to live with us.
not to live, to stay with us for a couple of days, until he finds his own place.
is he still dealing with his breakup from Daisy?
Yeah. I feel bad for the kid, you know?
it's-it's tough. Uh-huh.
he's going through an "early life crisis." Good luck.
good luck? I don't need luck.
this is not about luck, this is about a friend extending to another friend.
it's like an olive branch, that...
stop. Can we just stop, and deal with this here?
the remains... what's up with this?
based on the width of the greater sciatic notch, and the dorsal margin of the pubic face, this was a female.
early to mid-20s.
there's no organs to examine, so there's nothing for me here.
the Cochliomyia macellaria eggs and larvae measuring upwards of four millimeters means our victim's been dead for about 36 hours.
is that a foot?
that is a foot. Hey, so... Sweets told Angela that he was never getting involved with anyone again, so... good luck with that.
let's stop with the luck stuff, okay?
can we just deal with what's going on in front of us, here?
okay, Bones, so it only took a day and a half to get down to bone?
heavy sharp force trauma indicates that tissue, muscle and viscera have been ripped from her bones.
Where's all the guts stuff?
I think I might have found it.
Yeah. Guts stuff.
there's a leak.
no guts, no glory.
good luck with that.
numerous deep incisions to the glabella, superorbital ridges, zygomatic arches...
her face was scratched off.
...thoracic and pelvic regions, and the extremities.
Oh, my God. This is awful.
Yes. It will take some time to catalog.
judging by the mass, this has to be almost all her flesh.
with this many wounds, there should be particulates from the weapon on the bone.
it's going to be difficult to isolate cause of death.
it'll be a doozy.
Yes, a real doozy.
we should get whatever flesh is still on these bones removed.
okay, just please tell me that this poor thing was dead before any of this happened.
I'm sure she was. - Definitely.
great.
Hodgins and Cam are lying to Angela tore her feelings.
Yeah, I got that.
because we have not in any way ascertained if the victim was dead or alive when she was flayed to the bone.
we have ascertained, actually.
acute liver hemorrhaging suggests that the victim was still alive when she was eviscerated.
so I out-and-out lied to Angela.
thank you for that.
what kind of monster guts his victim, and then removes all her flesh?
in 1957, Ed Gein was arrested for murder.
and while searching his home, police stumbled upon bowls made of human skulls, lampshades of human flesh, even a belt made out of nipples.
the heinousness of Gein's crimes diminishes in comparison to those of the Aztecs.
more heinous than a nipple belt?
in order to appease Huehueteotl, the fire god, the Aztecs would burn their captives alive.
moments before death, the human sacrifices were pulled from the fire to have their still-beating hearts ripped out of their chests.
those were the good old days.
those were the bad days.
what... what kind of freak feels nostalgic over human sacrifices?
I'm gonna go ahead and plead the Fifth on that.
severe chipping to the frontal, nasal and zygomatic bones prevents a complete facial reconstruction.
Hey, does that mean that Angela's off the hook for this one?
Yes. - Yes!
um, actually... I hate to be the one to suggest this, but Angela might be able to reconstruct the face from the face.
you mean the face from the skin, right?
I have an ear, some cheek, and part of a nose.
I'll see what else I can dig up.
that is a very good idea, Cam.
no need to tell Angela that this was my very good idea.
teamwork.
so, you're staying here.
Parker won't be visiting us for a couple months, so... Sorry about all the junk and toys.
Oh, no. Beats the hell out of my office.
look at all this stuff.
kids from broken homes really rake in the material goods by way of compensation.
right. Uh... take a look at this.
take a closer look, all right? - What? Oh, my God.
this corpse is so mutilated.
cut right down to the bones. So, you're a psychologist.
who would do something like this?
you want me to figure that out right now?
no, tell you what. Why don't you just relax, make yourself at home.
huh? Take things in. All right?
Thanks. - Yep.
this is the last piece of facial tissue I found.
thank God.
this is not why I went to art school.
I'll start loading the images into the computer, and I'll piece them together, and then I will hurl.
well, how long do you think it'll take you to piece the pieces together?
Oh, not long.
I am starting a pool on how long Sweets lasts with Booth and Brennan.
I say he's out tonight.
did you swab the cuts in the bones?
I did, yes. Yes.
so are you in on the pool?
I give Sweets four days.
What'd you find? - Ammonium hydroxide.
it's the same stuff that's all over our victim's clothing.
so, Angie, how long do you give Sweets?
I say he lives with them permanently from now on.
what's ammonium hydroxide?
it's a cleaning product.
the killer probably used it to wash away the evidence.
huh. Did it work?
well, yeah, it's wiped out all the other evidence as far as I can see.
W-what do you mean,"from now on?
I mean for the foreseeable future.
they will adopt him.
well... I don't have a box for infinity.
I mean, the furthest I went was a month.
okay. Then I'll take the month.
our killer is sick and smart. I hate that combination.
okay, so, this program will search for wrinkles, freckles, and other microscopic facial features on each piece, pick up the pattern, and pair it with the corresponding piece.
very Frankenstein-y.
okay, so I'm gonna wrap the face around the image of the victim's skull.
add in eyeballs and hair... Okay.
what do you think? - That?
most definitely looks like a human person.
I know this woman. - You do?
Oh, my God.
what? Is this a friend of yours?
not a friend...
okay. This is Michael Vincent's favorite applesauce.
and what does that have to do with our victim?
someone killed the Them Apples Applesauce lady.
them Apples Applesauce is owned by the two girls that are on the label，Jessica Pearson and Brooke Guminski.
it's the applesauce I buy for Christine, too.
what the hell's going on here? What is this, olden times?
olden times is not a legitimate historical reference.
but I see your point. - Right.
there's a pickle maker and a candlestick maker.
I know what this is.
okay. What is this, a time portal?
no, this is an artisanal community, Booth.
Oh, that's just ridiculous.
from an anthropological standpoint, the artisanal subculture is fascinating.
Really? Fascinating?
well, to me, I think it's just stupid.
the Founding Fathers were heavily influenced by the Athenians, which resulted in democracy.
so... - Uh, great.
democracy, Bones, not a pickle.
enjoy your pickles. And, hey...
creating handcrafted, handmade products provides artisans with the authenticity they feel is lacking in today's technology-driven, industrialized world.
great, okay. Eat your pickle. We're here.
these are very good. - That's nice.
you should've eaten yours. - I don't want a pickle.
in the 1930s, Joseph Ball killed over 20 women and fed their remains to alligators.
was this victim fed to alligators?
I don't think so. - Then shut up about alligators.
hemorrhagic staining indicates these wounds were made around time of death.
the dimension of the V-shaped incisions suggest the weapon used to create them was a blade.
those are some seriously deep cuts, which only a serrated blade should be capable of making, but I'm not finding any evidence of striations in these wounds.
Meaning?
whoever did this is incredibly strong.
you okay? Is there someone we should call?
usually I'd say Jessica.
we ran this place together.
I can't believe she's dead.
she is most certainly dead.
very sorry for your loss.
when was the last time you saw your partner?
Saturday afternoon.
we had a pretty good morning at the farmers market.
we had lunch.
I dropped her off at the free clinic.
she was my best friend.
charge nine dollars for a jar of applesauce?
Yes.
pay nine bucks for this stuff? - Yes.
every apple is handpicked from local orchards. No chemicals, no additives.
you think somebody killed Jessica because we charge nine dollars for applesauce?
uh, so, um, what was the purpose for her going to the free clinic?
Jessica had lupus.
she went in for her monthly checkup before starting a sales tour.
she was going to cover every farmers market in Maryland, starting with Baltimore.
we were just starting to make a go of this.
can you think of anyone who would want to hurt your partner?
maybe. - Maybe?
there's this creep Adam.
he's been getting kind of stalkery with Jessica lately.
stalkery how?
kept bringing her meat.
meat? No, that's definitely not normal.
Oh, no, yeah, Adam is a butcher.
he's creepy, but he's the butcher down the street.
Yeah, I'm Adam. What do you want?
okay, Adam, FBI, all right?
let's put the cleaver down. Have to ask you a few questions.
here we go again.
you know, my shop is safer than any regulations that agri-business paid for.
I source all my meat locally, all grass fed.
no hormones of any kind.
Hey, pal, I don't care about your meat.
we just have to ask you a few questions about the death of Jessica Pearson.
death? What are you talking about?
ms. Pearson's mutilated remains were found in a garbage can a quarter of a mile from here.
Oh, my God. That's horrible. W-What happened?
our evidence indicates that the murder was committed by an exceptionally strong man skilled at using an extremely sharp knife.
you think I killed Jessica?
well, we do know that you were trying to romance her with free meat.
look, Jessica could barely afford food.
every dime of hers went into her business.
I was just trying to help her out.
for what in return?
nothing, especially after this guy came in and threatened me.
what guy?
I don't know, some big-ass, angry looking guy.
he threatened to crush my skull like a cracker if I didn't lay off Jessica.
Adam, do you rub ammonia on your meat as a way of killing bacteria?
this is an artisan butchery.
I'd never use chemicals.
look, you can accuse me of murder, but when you start insulting my craft, that's where I draw the line.
good to know your priorities.
we need to examine your knives as possible murder weapons.
you want my knives? Get a warrant.
you found any more money in her clothes?
Yep. It was mixed up in the garbage.
Oh. Yeah, the smell was a dead giveaway.
let's see what we got.
so, we found 20 $100 bills on the victim.
that's a lot of money for a girl who can barely afford to eat.
well, Brennan said that the victim was at a farmers market selling her applesauce the morning before she died.
I mean, maybe that's where she got the money.
no, I don't think so.
look at this.
the bills are sequential, meaning that they came from the same source.
we love our kid, but we're not spending two grand a month on applesauce at a farmers market.
what is she doing with all this cash?
and why was she making monthly trips to the doctor for blood tests?
her partner said that she had lupus.
I know, but she didn't.
I tested all the tissue.
our victim was perfectly healthy.
she was lying to her partner. But the question is: why?
regular doctor visits for no reason, a wad of cash.
think she was selling pills?
want more? Aw.
booth is upset that I pay nine dollars a jar for Christine's applesauce.
well, artisanal products are more expensive to produce, so of course they're more expensive to purchase.
but the value comes in knowing that they're not made by some faceless, soul-destroying corporation.
you seem to have a real appreciation for the artisan, Sweets.
I used to work in a record shop.
I'm afraid Christine will never know what a record is.
digital will never replace vinyl.
hey there, you three.
huh? Let's go, Sweets.
booth, Sweets was going to get a hotel room.
hotels are nice. - Yeah, I'll be fine.
no, if you stay at a hotel, you will feel rushed and you'll take an apartment that does not align with your sensibilities.
wait a second, Sweets has sensibilities?
Yes. He worked in a record shop. - So?
I think what Dr. Brennan means is that working in a moribund enterprise gave me a lasting appreciation for the craftsmanship that goes into making a record.
you know, I remember stocking this T. Rex album.
uh, the one with 20th Century Boy.
and the liner notes, the album art, even the tactile feel of the vinyl...
and so you need an apartment that tickles your same fancy.
Yeah. - Whoa, excuse me.
those are my underwear, pal.
what is he doing?
sweets has been very helpful. He vacuumed, did the laundry.
all right, that's great and all, but a man doesn't fold another man's underwear.
are those Captain America boxers?
booth has a nostalgic side, too.
you know, psychologically, we yearn for our past because we fear our future or you just like Captain America or old records or your own apartment.
so can we go now? Come on, we have a doctor to talk to.
let's go. Thanks. Thanks for that. Appreciate it.
I'm sorry.
okay.
I saw Jessica at the clinic just last Saturday. Is she okay?
Jessica was murdered last Saturday evening.
Oh, my God.
was Jessica healthy, Dr. Reese?
Yes. Very. Why?
why did she come visit you every month?
well, that's confidential information. Thank you.
not when your patient's been murdered.
we found a lot of cash on her, so we're thinking maybe the two of you were selling drugs.
that's absurd.
you wouldn't be the first doctor to make a little extra cash distributing pills on the street.
Jessica needed money.
that isn't why she had an appointment every month.
I have to tell you? Legally?
I'm afraid so.
I don't want you to get the wrong impression of Jessica.
okay, well, trust us.
Jessica came to the clinic once a month to have her blood tested for STDs.
STDs, cash.
Jessica was a prostitute?
it's not my job to tell my patients how to live their lives.
I just want them to stay healthy.
pig bones? - Yes.
and I believe Dr. Brennan will heap praise on me for acquiring them.
not as if that will cheer me up.
and why?
because I got them from Adam Borchardt, from his butchery.
the suspect?
it's a lot easier than waiting for a warrant that might never come.
I figured if our butcher butchered the victim, he might have done it in a similar manner in which he would butcher an animal.
I might have to heap a little praise on you, too.
it would be wasted.
look at the cuts on our victim's bones.
each one extremely precise and clean.
no clefts, no hesitation marks, definitely made by someone who knows what he's doing.
like the butchered pig bones.
and the flesh was removed in a similar way as our victim's.
is it true that she was a lady of the night?
according to Booth, she may have been prostituting herself as a way of supplementing her income.
an occasional prostitute.
interesting.
I was thinking sad.
the nicks on both sides of the mandible appear to be at the ends of an arc that would've transected the victim's left-side carotid artery.
the killer slit her throat.
judging by the microscopic spalls, the nick on the right side of the mandible would be the exit wound, meaning the killer was right-handed, which rules out our left-handed butcher.
I don't look so good now, do I?
does that cheer you up?
a little.
Oh, my God.
the killer slit her throat.
that's now old news.
and she was an occasional prostitute that was dumped in the garbage.
there is more than butchery and applesauce that's old school here.
the killer was mimicking Jack, the Ripper.
do I even want to know?
Dr. Saroyan.
it's past 10: 00. What are you still doing here?
Oh, digging through the booze-soaked lobster ravioli I found in the victim's stomach.
last meal, huh?
Two-thousand-buck- a-night call girl, definitely not skimping on dinner.
you might be able to find what restaurant she went to.
your turn.
I am examining the victim's remains.
by the light of a lantern?
the lantern provides oblique lighting, which bounces off an angled reflector and back onto the bone, which happens to be awesome for spotting scratches and micro cuts on bone.
but mostly it's because it appeals to your sense of the macabre.
it does make me look insane, doesn't it?
Yes.
Yeah. But what if I told you I found something?
microfracturing on the anterior aspect of the right radius and ulna is inconsistent with the V-shaped incisions.
so, not caused by a blade?
Nope.
what do you think caused them?
well, I do not know, but I can certainly keep looking.
and people think I'm creepy, because I'm a pathologist.
bones. - Yes?
is Sweets in our bathroom?
Yes. Should I have put a note on the door?
well, a little warning would have been nice.
what's he doing in our bathtub?!
jets.
our jets... in our bathtub.
societies in Japan and Turkey encourage public bathing. In modern-day Finland...
Finland? Whoa, whoa! This is not Finland.
sorry, Booth. I should have locked the door, huh?
because you played on so many sports teams and spent a lot of time in the army,I assumed you were comfortable with male nudity.
you know, fear of nudity is called "gymnophobia"?
okay, listen, psychology and anthropology
I liked it better when you two were fighting, all right?
are we done with our bathtub?
Yeah. - Yeah.
I like to soak in our tub after work.
if you'd seen Booth's X-rays, you'd understand.
the list of bones that he hasn't broken is shorter than the ones that he has.
Really? Now what?
yeah?
Hey, is Dr. Brennan home? - What the hell are you doing here?
sweets, looking right up your skirt there.
we weren't expecting guests.
we're not expecting... What are you...?
Hello? Time out. Can this not wait until tomorrow?
doctor, check this out. Microfracturing on both wrists.
very symmetrical.
the victim was restrained.
this is looking more and more like an abduction - torture scenario.
this can't wait till tomorrow because...?
this probably isn't a one-time thing.
we have a serial killer!
that's what I'm saying! Jack, the Ripper is back.
Jack, the Ripper. I don't buy it. - Why?
because serial killers don't dump their victims in the garbage. Let's go. Out!
out. Get out of the house. Bye-bye. Done.
back to the lab, squints. And you, Sweets, go put some clothes on.
OK! Now I have to go clean the tub, thanks to Sweets.
what did I do? You don't need to clean it.
just get up the stairs, Sweets.
what am I, a sasquatch? - Yes.
this artisan world-- that's why I studied art in the first place, to pursue my true passion.
Hey, I thought I was your true passion.
you know what I mean. - Yes, I do.
my true passion are bugs and slime and yours is art.
but come on, now. I think we're doing pretty well.
Dr. Hodgins, what does an ethanol composed of rye, juniper berries and licorice mean to you?
juniper berries and rye points to gin.
licorice... Is it part of the liquor or separate?
in the liquor.
it was the last thing our victim drank before she was murdered.
was there a sign of any drugs? Rohypnol? Narcotics?
no.
Hey, gin can be pretty debilitating all on its own.
but she didn't drink all that much.
well, you'd think a prostitute would deaden the pain with anything she could find.
I hope someone isn't targeting prostitutes.
it would help if we could talk to the pimp, but Booth's had a hard time tracking him down.
old Tom Gin! - Excuse me?
old Tom Gin is an old-fashioned English gin sweetened with licorice instead of sugar.
it's extremely rare today.
it sounds like more artisans.
Yeah, Cam is right.
old Tom Gin is made at Dr. Biltmore's micro distillery，which is a few blocks from our victim's applesauce store.
and, oh, boy.
what?
Dr. Biltmore's is owned and operated by Dr. Cole Reese, the doctor that treated our victim.
maybe it's a coincidence.
sure.
Reese had his own practice, but closed it to open up a distillery.
so he volunteers at the free clinic.
these people all seem to be following their dreams.
Reese is following something, all right.
look, read his record.
right. Arrested for solicitation in 2003.
you know, one of the most prevalent theories about Jack the Ripper is that he was, in fact, a physician.
the clinic would be an ideal way to pick victims.
right, and to ensure that the victim wasn't an undercover cop, hmm?
that, too. - Yep.
booth, the front door is off its hinges.
it looks like Reese is really into the good old days.
it sounds like he's not alone.
I'll get the door. Shh.
drop it, Reese! Drop it.
just give me an excuse. Just one.
you know, most doctors live by a code of ethics.
do no harm is one of them.
and who was I harming, Dr. Sweets?
I'm the victim here.
you're the...? Excuse me?
you were caught tying up a woman, holding a knife.
harmless role-play.
and paying Jessica, who was one of your patients, that's also harmless?
Yes.
I follow my passions.
that's nothing to be ashamed of.
it's moralizing psychologists like you that make society puritanical and narrow-minded.
it's psychologists like me that understand that you are to coin a 19th century term you might be familiar with-- a paraphiliac.
I don't want to kidnap and ravish an actual unwitting young woman, so I hire someone to play the role of the damsel in distress.
that's all these events were.
but even though you were paying her, you still had to get Jessica drunk to get her to play along.
Jessica had never been handcuffed before.
she was nervous. I was hoping that a libation would loosen her up a little.
well, judging by the fractures on her wrists, I guess that didn't work out too well, did it?
Jessica began struggling, she was screaming to be let go.
since you're into bondage, seeing her in pain must have turned you on.
I'm not a monster.
listen, that poor girl was making herself bleed trying to rip the handcuffs from the bedpost.
I took them off her as quickly as I could.
next thing I know, the front door is kicked in, this 250-pound behemoth throws me across the room.
her pimp? - Bodyguard.
he stuffed me in a closet.
did he say anything? - No.
he was obviously furious.
but he was silent. No threats, nothing.
well, we'll be analyzing all of the surgical instruments from your clinic, Dr. Reese.
be my guest.
and the antique medical equipment we found hidden in your apartment.
those tools are very valuable.
that's the only reason that they were hidden.
these antiques are beautiful, but the edges are far too rough to have caused the injuries we found.
if I were to create a calendar of history's most ghoulish killings, the Black Dahlia murder would have to be my December.
had medical examiners in 1947 had access to the technology we have today, Elizabeth Short's murder would have certainly been solved.
well, the Medio-Cam would have easily unearthed particulates left behind by the murder weapon.
the considerable space between the blade and the V-shaped incision suggests this knife is too small to be the murder weapon.
but we've only just begun.
sure looks like the Doc. loved his sharp objects.
and we have casts of some of the bone injuries.
will you tell me again about the French nobleman who bathed in the blood of children?
in a moment, Mr. Fisher. - Okay.
both knives appear to be tilted downward in the femur at the same 45-degree angle.
that looks like a 45-degree angle on the humerus and the radius as well.
all of these incisions appear to have been made in a downward motion - at precisely the same angle. - Meaning?
the killer was even more precise than we had originally thought.
well, I can't think of anyone more precise than a doctor.
I wish his tools agreed with you.
Hey, Booth, I wanted to apologize for last night.
I totally took advantage of your hospitality.
that wasn't cool.
uh, don't worry about it, Sweets.
you know what? It's a great tub.
Oh, it really is.
those jets are awesome... - Stop. All right, enough with the tub talk.
okay. Um, I'm looking for an apartment.
that's good. You know what? That's a great first step.
what is it?
none of the doctor's tools matched the injuries of the bones.
I got to admit, I'm off the doctor as a prime suspect.
so, what are you thinking, it was the pimp?
well, I'm wondering why a pimp would interrupt his prostitute at work.
she could be freelancing, cutting the pimp out of the equation.
Yeah, that could get someone killed. Or... - Or...
the big guy was a client who had developed feelings for Jessica.
you know, that kind of paranoid unrequited love could definitely fuel feelings of intense rage.
that's him. That's our guy. I gotta find him.
I gotta find an apartment.
okay, so keep your eye out for a man, approximately six-foot-six, between 250 and 280 pounds, dark hair.
I'm looking for him anywhere near Reese's place.
wouldn't imagine there would be that many surveillance cameras in the neighborhood.
Yeah. You know, none of the artisanal shops even use them.
half of them don't even have phones.
in New York, the police eventually tracked down the Son of Sam through a parking ticket.
a ticket. That's genius, Cam.
this Web site collects all traffic violations to analyze traffic flow and congestion.
And?
Reese lives one door from the intersection.
these are all the photos of the drivers caught running the red on Reese's block on Saturday night when Jessica was with Reese.
you think he was driving? - No, no.
but look at the angle of the camera.
right across the street from Reese's building.
there he is. Look, in the background.
you sure this is our guy?
well, yeah.
I mean, unless you see another six-foot-six, 250-pound man in front of Reese's building at the same time the victim was there.
let's get the FBI to put his picture on the nightly news, see if the public can identify him.
pretty cool.
well done.
I saw my face on the news, turned myself in.
I did not kill Jessica.
that girl meant the world to me.
what was it, Willis?
did you end up buying a night or two with her and end up falling in love?
no, no.
you have it all really wrong.
okay, why don't you tell me how it really right is?
Jessica was my niece.
Ah, you know, you're not starting off too good.
see, Jessica Pearson has no family members.
not by blood.
Jessica's father and I were best friends since we were seven years old.
when he died, I promised him that I would take care of his daughter.
that was ten years ago.
and why should I believe you?
I got photos of me and Jessica since she was five.
okay?
look. High school graduation.
after that, I paid for two years of college.
you can check it all out.
as Jessica got older, she didn't need me as much.
maybe I reminded her of her dad, I don't know.
she calls me out of the blue about some guy who was scaring her.
the butcher?
I took care of that.
but I'm not stupid.
I have eyes.
I saw how Jessica's life was going.
so you figured out that she was... - Yeah.
I saw it.
so you followed her?
I heard her scream.
so I kicked down the door... - And you stuffed her client in the closet.
I came this close to killing him.
this close.
you and me could be sitting here now, only you'd be right.
agent Booth, you got anybody that you're responsible for?
who needs help even though they feel like they got to out in the world on their own?
Oh, yeah.
look, I'm in banking.
I'm not a big guy, medium guy.
but I told Jessica that I could get investors for her applesauce company, so that she could stop... ...taking clients for money and make a go of it.
was she going to take the deal?
she said she'd think about it.
that was the last night you saw her.
Yes.
okay, so this is a rundown of how the injuries were dispersed across the remains.
four incisions to the skull, seven to the right arm, six to the left, eight to the thoracic region, two to the pelvis and another four on each leg.
it appears as if the spacing between the incisions on the left arm is equal to the spacing between the incisions on the thoracic region.
okay, that's interesting.
let me try the right arm.
try the legs, Angela.
what is this telling us?
this is the position the victim was in when her flesh was removed.
she was protecting herself.
she was cut 18 times with surgical-like precision.
why would she stay in the same position throughout the entire attack?
perhaps she was already dead at this point?
or worse, she could have been paralyzed and forced to bare witness to the systematic carving of her own flesh.
there's something very odd here.
well, yeah, but you're gonna have to be a little bit more specific than that for those of us who find this entire scenario odd.
these wounds are too regular, too precise.
each one is calculated.
the surgical precision, the working knowledge of the human anatomy.
I think the doctor's our guy.
no.
the evidence indicates that this was done by some kind of machine.
Yeah, I believe if Jessica Pearson wanted to sell out, her partner might have been angry enough to murder.
come on, really? Over applesauce?
for artisans, it's their life.
you know, Brooke might have thought that Jessica was attacking the very foundation of her life.
Oh, better her partner is a prostitute than it sells out?
essentially, yeah.
it's not about money for these people.
you know, artisans go into business 'cause they're passionate about the products they create.
that is so un-American.
Hey, so, uh, I'm going to move out of the house tonight.
Hey, you found a place? - You've been great, but I think we both know it's time I face the world on my own.
it's time.
excuse me. Brooke Guminski, we have a search warrant here for the premises.
can't this wait? I've got orders to fill, and I'm all by myself.
well, you should have considered that before you killed Jessica.
we know that Jessica came to visit you before she left for Baltimore; we know what you two were talking about.
we didn't talk about anything.
she stopped to grab a couple jars before she left town.
booth? - Yeah?
I believe I discovered the murder weapon.
what do we have here? - Nothing.
it's a ribbon blender.
we use it to blend spices into our sauce.
if the victim fell into this blender while the blades were spinning, her body would have become wedged to the side where the blades would have continuously sliced her at a 45-degree angle while removing her flesh.
it was an accident, wasn't it?
we are certain to find bone shards or splinters in here.
look, it looks much better to the jury if you tell me that it was an accident before Bones here finds any evidence.
it was an accident.
she told me she wanted to sell, and I slapped her and...
would it have been so bad to make some money?
my parents only cared about money.
it destroyed their marriage.
it destroyed my childhood.
I didn't mean for Jessica to fall in.
I turned it off, but it was too late.
I didn't know what to do, so I cleaned up the mess and I dumped the body down the street.
I'm sorry.
sometimes I feel guilty feeling so good after Christine goes to bed.
good to be happy when the baby goes down.
is it? - Yeah, it is.
it gives us time to be alone, huh?
this applesauce is pretty good.
Yeah. You want some?
no. The wine is fine.
it's not bad, I'm telling you.
nine bucks.
Nine-buck applesauce is kind of like drinking a fine wine.
I mean, I'm telling you.
Plus, keeps the doctor away.
actually, eating too many apples could do the opposite, since they contain a lot of sugar.
you could get diabetes.
great.
that's nine bucks down the drain, hmm?
you know what?
stick with the Scotch. Alone time...
all right, thanks.
what-- wait, you're leaving?
Yeah, I don't want to overstay my welcome.
thanks a million though for... - Come on, Sweets. Come on in.
you know, hey, have some sauce. We have apple or wine.
but you can't have my Scotch.
did I somehow give you the impression that you should leave?
because you haven't overstayed your welcome, yet.
come on, put the bag back. Put it back.
is this because you want to win the pool?
Oh, you know about that?
Yeah, Booth only wins if I stay another two weeks, right?
is that why you want him to stay? - No. No.
don't you think that as a man, I should be on my own? I mean...
most cultures have ceremonies to celebrate milestones in a man's life.
Oh, God, this isn't about circumcision, is it?
no, it's about dancing. - What?
there are three important elements in moving on pasting an old relationship: admission...
- I admit it's over with Daisy.
cleansing... - Right, you were in our jet tub.
...and celebration.
so I can't get my own apartment till I celebrate being alone?
it's right. - Anthropology is all about dancing.
you are getting in on this?
no. Why? It's your ceremony.
bones, what are you doing?
are you okay?
celebrate! You're free!
I am free. I am free!
and someone out there who doesn't know it yet will be getting the great gift that is you.
lucky, lucky them!
Yeah! They are lucky!
okay.
elevator down.
I feel so at home right now.
Yes.
Frenzied,"passion for art "is a canker that devours everything else.
Dr. Brennan, Agent Booth, he's coming around.
Hey, there, Michelangelo, you hear me?
you shouldn't call him that, Booth.
if he had a head injury, he might think that's who he is.
something's poking in my back.
and something smells terrible.
do you know your name?
Yes. - Okay, what is it?
I'm not saying. - Told you.
you confused him. - No, I didn't.
I'm not confused, I'm just not telling you my name.
see, he's not confused.
vitals are stable, no sign of concussion, but... Who are you?
who are we? FBI, that's who we are.
since when does FBI cover billboard vandalism?
I'd like to begin my examination.
ambulance guy says I'm okay. - Well, she doesn't mean you.
you're glued to decomposed human remains.
we're gonna flip you on the board.
okay, let's do it.
you three grab the head. You two grab the feet.
easy on the neck, okay?
one, two, three.
this is weird.
easy on the shoulder. Take it slow.
What-what's on my back?
why is it sticking to him?
industrial strength adhesive.
I got it.
you know what, Bones, he was... he was standing up there, sticking that to that.
he tripped over his bucket.
the buckets falls and he gets stuck. Right?
there's a dead dude stuck to my back?
bones, why can't we just, you know, peel them apart?
the adhesive has had ample time to adhere.
pulling them apart would rip off Michelangelo's skin, or worse, completely destroy the evidence.
worse than ripping off my skin?
well, this could certainly be cause of death.
what?
an anomalous projectile completed a transparietal trajectory.
why can't you just be simple?
arrow through the head. Murder.
insect and rat activity is indicated.
we must be near an open sewer.
Oh, come on, man!
get it off of me!
after we get back to the lab.
Yeah, it should give you and your new buddy some time to bond there.
we caught a good one.
we've been over this.
there's no such thing as a good murder.
babe, I need your secret stash of peanut butter.
Hodgins, I bring in my peanut butter for a little comfort food every once in a while.
for comfort? Why?
I got a ticket this morning.
speeding?
no, I turned right on a red.
well, that's legal.
not at Broadway and Nash.
it's like a police trap over there.
they just wait, like fishermen after trout.
I think you mean like a deer hunter at a salt lick.
was there a sign?
there was one, but it was really small.
okay, well then, you definitely have to fight it.
Why? - Because it's unfair.
now, come on, if you can give me the peanut butter, then the Jeffersonian will reimburse you.
shouldn't I just pay the fine and get on with my life?
what?
where is the spark plug that I married?
the spark plug you married conducted an unfettered sex life and never lived anywhere for more than a couple of years.
you want her back around?
there's really no way to answer that without making you mad.
babe, peanut butter.
cover your eyes.
are we allowed to laugh?
no. - Okay.
what are we calling the one that's still alive?
well, Booth calls him Michelangelo.
Michelangelo worked on commission.
that's no kind of real artist.
Michelangelo's no kind of real artist. Good to know.
why won't you tell us your name?
cause I don't want you to know it.
kind of obvious, right?
large, rugged pelvis suggests the victim was a Caucasian male.
I have a large, rugged pelvis?
Boo-ya!
not you, the murder victim.
upper margin formation on the pubic synthesis indicates early 30s.
the victim's C5 and C6 vertebrae have been fused.
uncommon for someone that young.
hmm. If we find the doctor who performed the procedure, we can identify the victim.
how about the corpse that's trying to sodomize me?
we have to separate Michelangelo and the corpse.
there we go.
what about a laser?
no, no lasers.
I-I agree with the smart and beautiful angel.
well, the smart and beautiful angel is gonna go find out who fused our victim's neck bones.
okay, fracture lines from the obscured region and onto the zygomatic, indicative of a perimortem trauma to the facial bones.
the arrow's clearly visible on either side of the victim's skull, but it didn't actually pierce it.
steve Martin?
Michelangelo's real name is Steve Martin?
it's a gag. Thus, irrelevant.
the ends of the arrows are connected to a plastic headband. Steve Martin? No?
it's a gag. Thus, irrelevant.
Mr. Fisher, find a way to separate Michelangelo and Steve Martin without damaging the evidence.
okay.
everyone here is this weird combo of smart and dumb.
Dr. Saroyan nixed the laser.
I knew she would, which is why I brought this.
Oh, God, what did he bring?
peanut butter.
peanut butter?
I'm not a piece of toast.
the oils in the peanut butter will break down the cohesion of the cyanoacrylates.
the glue will unstick.
this guy's gonna rub me down with peanut butter? - Yep, and then cut off your clothes.
how's about she does that?
did you do that? - No.
Oh, my God. You're-you're Zed.
no, I'm not.
y-you are. You painted that. It's you.
the artist Zed?
what's a Zed?
zed's a legend, mysterious street artist that nobody's ever met.
my name is Seth Zalinsky.
okay, well, at least we got his name out of him.
come on, this mook isn't the elusive and brilliant Zed. Look at him.
I know my rights.
you can't just pin me down and slather peanut butter all over my private self.
what if we sedate you?
depends.
what do you got?
my name is Denny Bennet.
I'm the manager of Tele-Com Inc. Telemarketing.
I filed a missing persons report on one of my employees,
morgan Donnelly, three days ago.
why is he talking like that? - I don't know.
the company lawyer told me to speak clearly, tell the truth, and I'd have nothing to worry about.
right, well, you have one hell of a lawyer.
did you find, uh, Morgan?
Yes, he is dead.
Donnelly's dead? Dead, dead?
we identified him by his neck operation.
he was murdered.
Oh, my God, that can't be.
how am I supposed to go on?
Donnelly's my heir apparent.
I've been grooming him, and now I've got nobody.
what do you sell at Tele-Com?
everything. Last few weeks, we've been selling a time-share in Muncie, Indiana.
gateway to Indianapolis.
and he could sell that?
Yeah, he can... could sell anything.
did anyone resent Donnelly?
enough to kill him? No.
did he have difficulty with anyone?
his girlfriend stormed into the office last Friday, hollered at him in front of everyone.
claimed he was cheating on her.
like she's one to talk.
are you implying that she herself was unfaithful?
implying? Hell, I'll say it directly.
she was a cheater.
and how do you know?
she cheated on me with Donnelly.
so, you're telling me that he stole your girlfriend.
wow, that really must have pissed you off.
at first, but that was like, a year ago.
wait, am I a suspect?
most definitely.
I want to talk to the company lawyer.
in a sign of good faith, why don't you cough up the name and the address of the cheater girl?
I had to pry this peanut butter out of Angela's hands.
apparently, she needed the comfort of some smooth PB this morning after being caught making an illegal right on red.
Ah, police trap. Corner of Broadway and Nash. Been there, done that.
I feel... you know how when you wake up on Sunday morning, and you smell your mom making breakfast?
your dad's trying to make her dance to some ancient Tears for Fears song about shouting.
it's weird when the remains talk.
this is gonna work?
is that you, sweet chocolate angel?
Oh, my God. What did you give him?
some stuff for depression, mood swings, panic disorder...
okay. I don't want to know. What I heard: cup of chamomile tea.
we're done. - Okay.
you good for a few moments?
I am good for eternity.
let's go.
you here for my sponge bath?
that would be transcendent.
admit that Seth Zalinsky is not your only name.
well, in high school, they called me tripod.
Oh, now I'm very sad.
you did this. You're Zed.
zed is not my nickname.
it's my alter ego.
much bigger deal.
I'm very honored to meet you.
really. I mean, you are a wonderful, wonderful artist.
and you are really young, which is so much more impressive somehow.
I am totally babbling because I am starstruck.
that's what it is.
you want to make out?
you know, time was I would have jumped you, but I'm a married woman now, so I'm just gonna kiss you because of who you are.
okay?
I felt something move.
don't ruin my moment.
on my back.
I think the dead guy's separating.
you know, you really didn't have to come.
you said you wanted me to come with you. Where are we going?
we're gonna go talk to the hollering, cheating girlfriend.
no, I mean, my Prius has a voice-activated navigation system.
Oh, 709 Windsor Drive.
enter an address.
709 Windsor Drive.
searching.
now you don't have to unfold and refold a map.
wait a second. I like maps. What's wrong with maps?
well, maps cannot tell you the amount of traffic you should expect en route to your destination.
see? Now we can relax, talk about interesting things.
this is not how the cowboys settled this country.
the cowboys didn't have antibiotics.
do you also want to die from a skinned knuckle?
sometimes.
cowboys didn't settle this country. Farmers did.
Alexa! The FBI wants to talk to you!
you know, you shouldn't feel bad about living with your sister.
the current trend of delaying marriage, along with the economy means that people have to adapt.
however, it does complicate the sex life.
tell me about it.
Hey, I'm Alexa.
can I help you guys with something?
like to ask you a few questions about Morgan Donnelly.
here we go.
I'm afraid he's dead.
of course he is.
did he get crushed by a falling anvil or something?
no, that is not correct.
we believe you had an altercation with him a few days ago.
I find their upbeat demeanor highly suspicious.
this is a serious situation. He may have been murdered.
Oh! Murdered!
okay, careful, Mr. Fisher.
it's his hair, that's all.
there we go.
it is with great pleasure that I divorce these skulls.
massive blunt-force trauma to the facial bones.
the victim's skull is totally smashed in.
did I do that when I fell on him?
cause I didn't do it on purpose.
no, the fracture lines on the zygomatic bones indicate the trauma was sustained around time of death.
which was five days before you fell on him.
whoa, whoa, wait, there could be blowflies.
that explains the constant buzzing.
you are a very calm young man.
Pharmaceutically enhanced calm.
third instar larvae.
the victim die five days ago.
five days ago was Friday.
the same day the victim's girlfriend accused him of cheating.
God, it's so weird when they move.
that felt good.
almost as good as when that Asian chick kissed me.
wait. What?
that Asian chick kissed me.
let's clean Mr. Zalinsky up, and in some kind of clothes.
Oh, come... I already slathered him with peanut butter, plied him with pharmaceuticals, now I got to give him a sponge bath?
what Asian chick did you kiss?
the FBI really call in a psychiatrist because I laughed?
now you all think I'm some sort of psychopath?
I'm actually a psychologist, Ms. Eaton.
but, um, yes, Agent Booth called me because he was struck by your sudden mood swing.
I'm not a psycho!
can you tell me how you feel about Morgan Donnelly's death?
um, I'm very upset! Look at me.
can you tell me why you laughed?
because I thought it was another one of Morgan's practical jokes.
he was a joker?
Yes.
and I thought it was his way of totally making up after our fight.
what fight?
a girl walked up and kissed him.
I figured he didn't need to enjoy it so much.
a girl just walked up and kissed him?
Yeah, right on the lips. Some tongue action, too.
she recognized him.
what? I was not aware that telemarketers attracted that kind of notice.
morgan was a comedian, okay?
the telemarketing gig, it was just temporary.
okay, that explains the fake arrow through his head.
morgan had an amazing sense of humor.
girls like that in a guy.
Yeah, I always thought that that was... a lie.
so, was Morgan's sense of humor the reason why you left his boss?
look, if you met Denny, you'd know why I went for Morgan.
you think Denny could have killed Morgan out of jealousy?
after a year?
even Denny thinks faster than that.
okay, and when was the last time you saw Morgan?
he came over for dinner that same night, Friday.
and then I went to work.
I'm a bartender. You can check that out.
sure.
and then, when I came home, Morgan wasn't there.
I didn't kill Morgan. I loved him.
you know who you should be looking for?
whoever put that arrow gag on his head.
that wasn't his? - No way!
he hated that shtick stuff. His material was cerebral.
you wouldn't by any chance have footage of Morgan's stand-up?
my brother, Elliot, recorded every show.
Mr. Fisher, if we are to determine the murder weapon, it is of the uttermost importance that the remains be clean.
Dr. Hodgins has a plan.
I don't know if you're aware, but I do a bit of stand-up myself.
I imagine you are not very skilled at it as you are not a humorous person.
my routine is dark, disturbing and uncomfortable.
just the way a comedy show should be.
notice the large number of chips and fragments.
also how the chip itself is fragmented?
one blow created the chip, a second or a third shattered it again.
the victim was struck in the face several times with a blunt object.
do you find that amusing?
amusing? No.
darkly illuminating in a manner which allows us to laugh defiantly into the yawning abyss?
that's hilarious.
I'm sorry, I'm trying to see the hilarity, but all I see is a man who was beaten in the face until he died.
sorry.
Hey, hey, did you get anything off the laughing girlfriend?
Oh, Alexa Eaton and her brother laughed because they thought you and Dr. Brennan were a prank.
Oh, there's your motive for murder right there: practical jokes.
I mean, hey, everybody, you know, they hate practical jokers.
the victim was a stand-up comedian.
well, that would explain, you know, the arrow through the head.
the killer might have been another stand-up.
where would you get that?
well, the arrow on the head could have been placed there as a mark of derision.
you know, an insult.
whoa, whoa. Why? That's a funny bit.
Yeah, it's a classic. Uh, so I went through some of Morgan Donnelly's stand-up routine, came up with some interesting clues and insights.
arrow through the head, that's a... that's a funny gag.
Yeah, is, was, and always will be.
let me know when you want to hear the rest of my insights.
I have visual aids. - Okay, great.
I laugh out loud all the time I see that.
the arrow through the head.
it's funny.
who did all this stuff?
uh, what are you doing here?
they told me I could sleep on the couch. Did you paint this?
um... Yes.
Yes, those are mine.
why are you in my office?
I don't know. I think they roofied me. It was pretty great.
I do remember your husband was peeved that you kissed me.
Oh, yeah. Let me worry about Hodgins.
middle-class, suburban hang-ups and sexual values.
what are you, like, 19?
Oh, so you think my idealistic approach to art is adolescent?
but it looks to me like you used to have some ideals of your own.
before you got married, had a baby, started painting...
what the hell is that supposed to be?
uh... Do you want me to call you a cab or...
no, I can find my own way.
I have since I was an adolescent.
you're the only person in the world who knows my secret identity.
okay, Batman.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone.
let me guess, you're keeping it pure, right?
you want to make it about the art and not about the artist.
some things are easy to make fun of.
doesn't mean they're not important.
I'll make you a deal. You keep your lips zipped, and tonight, I'll take care of Broadway and Nash.
okay, your secret is safe with me.
you have excellent... ...technique.
know what else is completely made up?
general anxiety disorder.
Yeah, you know what this is?
it's called "life."
that's exactly what you need to do; get a life!
sir, if I've said anything to offend you, please, please know that I am delighted.
that heckler can be heard on several of the tapes.
every single time, Donnelly humiliates him in front of the crowd.
how many times you hear the same heckler?
about a dozen, and I haven't even been through all the tapes.
is that normal? - One heckler, time after time?
I asked Fisher. - Fisher the intern?
fisher the comic? - Fisher's funny?
not at all. He's kind of an underground sensation, though. It's brilliant.
fisher said it's not normal.
if anyone knows heckling, it's Fisher.
okay, how do we ID the heckler?
easy. His name's Larry Baron. He's another comic, crappy.
him and Morgan hated each other.
why didn't you just tell me that?
you didn't ask.
fine. Where can we find him?
he's the bartender at Laughtastic's.
Laughtastic's, great. So, why did you tape all of Morgan Donnelly's stand-up routines?
he was my sister's boyfriend. He hired me.
he was my mentor, and I fed him lots of good ideas.
he said I was his muse.
not in a creepy sex way or anything.
it was in a funny way.
any way you think you could introduce me to Fisher?
probably not 'cause of the murder investigation, huh?
is it too weird?
you're gonna get dermestid beetles in my peanut butter.
the beetles will eat what's left of the victim's flesh.
and for peanut butter, nothing beats Gromphadorhina portentosa, aka the Madagascar hissing cockroach.
so, this victim, did you ever hear of him?
he was a popular comic.
sure sign you've transgressed the unwritten rule of comedy.
I thought the only rule in comedy was to be funny.
tragically, you're not the only one who thinks that way.
well, if you ask me, it gets no better than the Stooges.
unfettered psychopathic violence!
hilarious, right?
not really, when you put it that way.
might I recommend, next time, watching with the volume turned off?
the absence of the cartoon sound effects makes it much more violent.
Yeah, I know Morgan Donnelly.
uh, you going to order a drink, or what?
Yeah, we'll have some water.
must be tough on a guy like you, huh?
serving drinks, has to watch other comedians on stage do their thing...
are you kidding?
that's like telling a Jew he doesn't want to be in Mecca.
in point of fact, Mecca is the center of the Muslim world.
it would be completely rational for a Jew to avoid Mecca.
especially during hajj.
Yeah, I'm fine. So... okay?
morgan Donnelly's dead.
Yeah, I heard that. It's terrible.
is it true that he oe told you, in front of a crowd, that if he wanted to hear from an ass, he would have farted?
Yeah. He did say that. He got a huge laugh, too.
we have proof that he humiliated you at least 20 times in front of audiences.
what?
I get it.
no, that wasn't a joke.
I know it wasn't a joke.
I know what is a joke and what isn't a joke.
I'm not sure you do.
now, don't heckle him, Bones. He might want to kill you next.
Oh, you got it all wrong.
look, me and Morgan... it was a setup.
setup? He wanted you to heckle him?
Definitely! Definitely. All those lines that he used on me?
you know, like the fart one?
or he's say, um... "There's an alcoholic who should stay anonymous.
I wrote all those.
Why?
it was my way of, uh, getting laughs.
it made the audience like Morgan, you know, so it's a... it's a win-win situation.
right. Well, thanks for your cooperation. Come on.
booth. - Yeah?
the man in this flyer has a fake arrow through his head.
Oh. Yeah. That's Rex.
and let me tell you, now that Donnelly is gone, he's gonna get the Friday night slot, so... that's got to make you suspicious, right?
you comedians really stick together, huh?
this could very well be the murder weapon.
Where's Rex now?
uh, he's warming up.
Where's your arrow through the head?
somebody stole it.
I never thought to report it directly to the FBI.
who stole it? - Could've been anyone.
that bit is classic.
I think... I think so, too. It is funny.
but my prime suspect: a so-called comic, so-called Morgan Donnelly.
okay, why do you think he stole it?
guy's a natural thief... props, jokes, women.
he steals it all.
he's dead. - Murdered.
sorry to say, that was bound to happen.
you really do hate this guy, huh?
both personally and professionally, yes.
Rex's mallet tested positive for blood.
positive for what?
blood.
now, that's funny.
Yes, I kissed him.
Why?
it wasn't a you-me kind of kiss.
this was a musty old auntie kiss.
yeah? Well, your musty old auntie kiss is the best kiss that kid ever got.
why are you being jealous? - Because he's... cool. You know?
and I'm... not.
and, I don't know, if you ever leave me, it's gonna be for someone who's cool.
cool" isn't really a thing anymore.
thank you for proving my point.
you still haven't told me why you kissed him.
Yeah, I... I promised him I wasn't gonna tell anybody, and...
I will tell you, though, because you are not just anybody.
I kissed him because he's a great artist.
and his art is changing the world.
he's Zed.
well, it's hard to argue with that.
you know what he said about my work?
he said that I have... "excellent technique.
well, that's great. - No.
no, honey, it's not great.
Well,"excellent" usually means great.
Brennan's got the murder weapon.
okay, listen, just... no more kissing any artists, or anyone else, for that matter.
yeah? Are we good?
Yes, honey, we are good.
you know why?
because I have excellent technique.
which is not good.
exactly.
ready?
just reinserting the last few pieces of dentition.
speaking of which, I found some slivers of tooth in some flesh that might have been a part of the victim's stomach.
bashed in the teeth, swallowed the fragments?
makes sense to me.
so let's hear it. - Excuse me?
you're a comedian, right? Can I hear one of your jokes?
Oh, I don't do jokes, Dr. Saroyan.
I do raw, unfiltered honesty.
let me hear some raw, unfiltered honesty, then.
as you wish.
I am incapable of truly loving another human being.
for that reason, I will never sire an heir.
okay. Well, then.
we have a tad too much tooth.
are you still doing your comedy here, or...?
no. No, you literally have too much tooth.
hold the laughs.
this is not tooth.
I'm back to my day job now, Dr. Saroyan.
you don't have to laugh.
what's that? - Visual aid.
joke one: "I love to brag about how modest I am.
that's not funny.
but it is both self-centered and self-deprecating.
joke number two: "I dated a 14-year-old once...
but I was 14, too, so it wasn't a big deal.
okay, wait, so you're saying that our victim was a self-centered, self-deprecating child abuser?
no, no, no. I'm saying that joke one and joke two weren't written by the same person.
how can you tell?
well, the notion of taking a subject as disturbing as pedophilia, turning it on its head, to create something as sweet and innocent as young love tells me that this joke was probably written by a woman.
Mr. Cantaloupe said our victim stole the jokes.
I agree.
okay, how does a comedian do that?
fisher says that open mike nights are the best place to steal fresh jokes.
okay? Now, Laughtastic's has an open mike night.
and Donnelly was a judge.
great. I'll just go there and get the information. Thanks.
how? - How? How I usually do it.
I'll go there, ask some questions with Bones, and she'll be on the lookout for somebody with a limp, which means that they fell in love with a 14-year-old and we go home.
that's how.
fisher and I have a better idea. - Fisher again.
you go to the open mike night.
you tell some of the jokes I've marked as stolen.
see if anyone gets mad. - Why me?
well, because...I have to keep an eye out for subtle reactions from the audience, and Fisher's too well-known.
he and I have written some original jokes for you.
you pepper in some of the stolen stuff, see if anyone lays claim to them.
you and Fisher wrote me a comedy routine?
okay.
the blue jokes I wrote, all right?
the yellow ones, stolen.
the black ones... - Fisher.
Yep. You have about a half an hour.
what?
is it just me, or are circles pointless?" What?
multiple radiating fracture lines originating on the glabella, terminated by fracture lines on the maxilla.
just as we suspected, multiple blows.
I come bearing bad news.
the mallet was not the murder weapon.
why was there blood all over it?
false positive, from the peroxidase enzyme found in turnip juice.
I hate to think how many turnips this man bludgeoned to death.
what about Dr. Saroyan's fragments?
ceramic.
let's have Angela recreate the fracture pattern on the Angelatron.
okay, I'll let her know.
okay! All right, uh, let's give it up...
are you nervous? - I've had people try to kill me, Sweets.
how could cracking jokes make me nervous?
just remember to look relaxed, as though you own the stage.
stop with the advice. Just, please?
okay, Fisher's here.
if it looks like you're in trouble, he'll heckle you.
why are you making such a big deal about this?
welcome to the stage for the first time... Cee-Lo Booth!
Seeley, not Cee-Lo.
Hey, what do you want? I went to public school.
so... Good evening.
thanks for coming out tonight.
you know who has a lot of great ideas?
lamps.
I hate my father. I mean, not for what he's done to me, but for what he hasn't done to me.
laugh. Laugh at the emptiness of my pain.
is it just me, or are circles pointless?
so far this act is pointless.
all right, pal, you want to quit shooting your mouth off before I shoot it off for you.
Oh, my God, Booth is funny. - Almost funny.
I once shot an unarmed man.
I mean, sure, I shot off both of his arms, but still.
so I was at the trial, and the prosecutor says to me on the stand, "Did you kill that man?" I said,"No.
he says,"You know what the penalty for perjury is?
I said,"Yeah, it's a lot less than the penalty for murder.
why-why am I even here?
fine.
so, uh... well, how about the guy who invented tanning beds? I mean, the nerve!
who looks at the sun and says,"Hey, I can do better.
I went to a cello recital the other night.
it was... it was a solo show.
meaning I was the only person in the audience.
even I don't get that one.
nobody likes a cello. It's just a violin with size issues, which is also a joke I wrote, like the others that you stole.
FBI, you're coming with me.
right. So.
quite a coincidence that you work at the same place as the murder victim.
two comedians, working a telemarketing day job?
Yeah. Bizarre coincidence there.
were you having an affair with Morgan Donnelly?
no. Why?
it says here Donnelly's girlfriend comes in ripping him a new one about a third woman.
maybe you didn't know about either one of them.
twice the jealousy, twice the motive?
three times.
see, he was stealing your jokes.
he deserved to die.
I was not sleeping with Morgan, and he was not stealing my jokes.
well, I told a couple of your jokes.
you accused me of stealing.
Yeah, Morgan bought my jokes.
$25 a pop plus a piece of the back end deal if he went on Letterman,
HBO, you know, whatever.
I could see why you didn't want to save those jokes for yourself.
I'm not funny.
I write funny, but I'm not funny.
some people are funny, like you.
others, like me, we do better off writing for the funny people.
so, you expect me to believe that Morgan Donnelly's death hurt your career.
hells yeah.
he was about to move to New York, do comedy full time.
is this the real deal or was this just the pipe dream?
for reals. He had bookings... TV shows, clubs.
you can check it out.
look, what you think is a motive for me to murder is actually the complete opposite of a motive for murder.
that's irony, and it's definitely not funny.
Capisce?
so, after pulling out the postmortem damage that was caused by Zalinsky's skull,
I used the intersections of the radiating fracture lines to determine that the facial trauma was actually a result of three separate blows.
here are the results of the initial blow.
it appears that the force of this blow and the force of the blow that broke the victim's metacarpals are nearly identical.
the weapon is the same one that broke his metacarpals.
please bring up the results of the second blow.
fracturing to the dentition, mandible, maxilla, and zygomatic bones.
the killer either picked up a larger weapon to finish the job or he swung a lighter weapon with greater force.
well, here are the results of the third blow.
okay, I-I'm sorry.
I know what this looks like to you, but this entire sequence here, I-it's The Three Stooges.
it's classic comedy in three blows.
I mean, the weapon is gonna be a frying pan.
this strike caused fragments of the glabella to pierce the victim's brain.
death blow.
which is not funny. - No, it's not.
based on the amorphous wound pattern, the murder weapon is curved upon its horizontal axis.
curved, ceramic, like a large vase?
Angie, I just sent you the results of the core sample I took from the shard of ceramic.
was it a vase?
not unless it was a vase full of urine.
it's a toilet?- Ding-ding-ding.
and the prize goes to the little lady wearing the blue lab coat.
sorry, yeah, I-I got excited.
so, his head was smashed into a toilet?
classic.
the first blow occurred when the victim had his hand on the edge of the toilet.
his face was smashed into his hand.
comedian was killed by a brutal swirly?
so, he was draped over the toilet, puking, when he was killed.
I'm... swirly.
so, how many toilets are there in the Metro D. C. area?
Oh, uh, approximately five and a half million.
how is that you know that?
there is approximately one toilet per person in the United States of America.
do you want me to figure out how much time it would take to inspect each toilet?
no, we don't have to do that.
why not? - Why?
I'll just get, you know, a warrant for all the toilets that the victim used regularly, and we'll start with that.
and when I say "we," I mean Hodgins.
one million, two hundred and fifty thousand man-hours.
w-what?
that's how long it would take to check out every toilet in D. C.
once you start with the math, you don't stop, right?
I think everyone's like that, don't you?
Yeah, I think so, definitely. Go math!
math people forever, right?
tell us about the last time you saw Morgan Donnelly.
I already told the other young man.
I made him dinner here.
what did you make?
beef stroganoff. Salad, ice cream.
did you feel well afterwards?
Yes, I went to work.
I was fine.
the FBI checked out my alibi. You already know.
was Morgan feeling all right when you left the house?
he was fine.
he and Elliot were gonna watch some soccer game and write jokes about it.
did your brother mention feeling sick the next morning?
Why? Do you think my cooking killed Morgan?
we have evidence that Morgan became ill that night.
it's very likely that he died while vomiting into your toilet.
Oh, my God, do you really think that I poisoned Morgan to death?
no. Morgan Donnelly died by someone smashing his head into the toilet bowl.
I want a lawyer.
and I want one for my brother.
morgan was moving to New York.
that's not true.
what made him vomit?
he was drinking a lot, you know, to work up the courage.
courage for what?
tell my sister he was going to dump her and take off.
you didn't know any of this?
so, it was a matter of defending your sister's honor?
not only.
I did all that work with Morgan and taped him.
he was supposed to helping me put my own act together, but he wasn't gonna.
he said something like, a comic has to be tough, make tough calls, and leave behind people he'd outgrown.
he's sitting there telling me all this stuff with a stupid arrow in his head.
I got mad and... - Poor Elliot.
I... did what I did.
then I wrapped him up in a shower curtain, drove him out to that woodsy area under the billboard.
came back, cleaned up the bathroom, put the shower curtain back up and...
okay, he's here, he's here, he's here.
what if he hates it?
Angela, it's okay.
he's leaving.
forget it.
man, shut up, okay?
do married people tell each other everything?
why didn't you paint something?
somebody beat me to it, man.
I got nothing better to say than she did.
you mean, you-you like it?
I love it.
but your technique blows.
Hey, you can't you talk to her... - Hodgins, it was a compliment.
sweets told me that you were really funny at the comedy club.
Oh, he wrote me some jokes.
no, he said that you bombed when you told his jokes, but that the audience laughed when you got mad.
wait a second, all right.
you're the one who said that comedy comes out of anger.
I have been a very good influence on the sophistication of your thinking.
I'm a very sophisticated man.
laughter can also be made to make people helpless and vulnerable.
perhaps that's why some comics say, "I killed tonight." Or,"I slaughtered them.
Side-splitting.
Yes. Exactly, humor is a kind of viol...
Oh, my God. Don't move. You have an arrow in your head.
no, Bones, it's a joke. I'm sorry. It was just...
you tried to scare me, but I scared you right back.
that is funny.
I was trying to make you laugh, okay?
and then you scared me. All right, that's not funny.
you and Sweets, you're not funny.
Wh... Really?
well, will you tell me one of Sweets' jokes?
okay, fine.
you know who's good ideas?
who? - Lamps.
lamps... yes.
Yes, yes, lamps have good ideas because they lightbulbs going on.
that's not funny.
that's really... it's really funny, Booth.
one more, tell me another.
okay, fine, is it just me or are circle pointless?
sweets is a genius.
circles are pointless because they are round.
get it?
one more, Booth.
pointless.
no, honey, I'm fine. Never better.
you just, uh, you told me to call after the jump, so here I am.
see? You worried for nothing.
not sure when I'm gonna be home exactly.
um, things are a little bit up in the air right now.
I'm just, I'm waiting on the other guys.
nothing! Nothing!
just, uh, still stoked from the jump is all.
honey, don't worry, okay? I'm fine. I'm just...
Peek-a-boo!
Christine, look. Mommy's gone.
Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo!
what are you doing? I don't understand.
she was lunging forward at six months, waving good-bye at seven months.
she routinely masters tasks several months beyond her age group.
Ah, she's brilliant. Very smart just like her dad.
mom.
then she should be able to grasp the conceptual elements of peek-a-boo before the others in daycare.
is that some kind of, like, baby Mensa requirement or something?
it demonstrates an infant's ability to understand object permanence.
Peek-a-boo!
Peek-a-boo! Morning. How is everyone?
Christine-- she doesn't understand peek-a-boo.
beg your pardon?
peek-a-boo. Her cognitive recognition skills belie her inability to engage in the game.
peek-a-boo. You're scaring her. Peek-a-boo.
now you're both scaring her. Peek-a-boo!
Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo!
bones, it really is a ridiculous game.
I agree. It's no hide-and-seek.
the Kazurinsky child loves peek-a-boo and she's one month younger than Christine.
Kazurinsky? What does that have to do with anything? Booth.
Peek-a-boo!
Peek-a-boo! - Right, right. Okay. On our way.
so, Mommy and Daddy got to go catch bad guys.
Boom-boom- boom-boom!
okay, Uncle Sweets here, right here, this guy? He's gonna take you to daycare.
uncle Sweets? I love you even if you can't...
peek-a-boo.
okay, Peek-a-boo!
bones? Bones, okay, let's go.
Peek-a-boo! - Bones, she'll probably be playing poker when we get back.
I'll make sure she plays with the Kazurinsky kid.
good idea.
Peek-a-boo!
nothing? Nothing.
what the hell happened here? It's quite intriguing.
well, you're not kidding. Okay, what the hell is that thing?
I'm thinking it's Mothman. Of course you would, bug boy.
all right, Bones, just be careful on that thing. Take it up!
so, what do we got here? Blood on the passenger seat's been wiped clean.
from more than a cut finger, that's for sure. Somebody drove a bleeding cocoon here and just took off?
Yeah. It makes you long for a simple stabbing, doesn't it? Not really.
you know what I'm thinking?
reports indicate that Mothman is a flying creature with a ten-foot wingspan and red eyes.
those witnesses saw what was most likely a sandhill crane, which can grow to be as tall as a man and has red feathers around its eyes.
how do you explain this, huh? We could be witnessing the birth of a new species.
mothman? You are a scientist, Dr. Hodgins.
and these remains are undeniably human.
the prominent brow ridge and the slanted frontal bone indicate the victim is a Caucasian male.
it does look human-y. Sorry to disappoint you.
so perhaps you can find a reasonable, scientific explanation for the cocoon.
what are you gonna do, cut the seats open?
someone thought they wiped the blood away from the seat. Look at this.
blood. This is no accident.
you know what? The gear shifter's in neutral. Somebody pushed this car down here.
the car slammed into the boulder, catapulted the whatever-that-is into the tree.
whoever drove this car really went through a lot of trouble to make it look like an accident, that's for sure.
Whoa! What are you doing?! We have to cut into the cocoon to get to the remains.
we don't even know what we're dealing with yet. I don't want to hear about Mothman anymore, Dr. Hodgins.
something spun this cocoon around our victim, okay?
I'm not saying it's Mothman... yet.
but, you know, until I determine exactly what did do it...
I won't disturb it. I'll just cut a small opening to see if I can determine cause of death or any other markers that might be of immediate value.
just be careful.
Oh, my God.
Dr. Hodgins, can you please get the bugs off my eyes? Yeah.
it's difficult to see. Huh.
could you, please?
right, yes. I'm sorry.
I think there's a couple more. Yeah. Okay, hold on.
the crashed vehicle was registered to a James Sutton.
James Sutton? You know him?
Yeah. Adventurer, archaeologist, book-writer,
temple of Doom guy. I read his work on the Mayan calendar and end of the world.
guess what? Didn't happen?
Plus, he misspelled "Mayan" and "calendar," so...
well, Sutton's physician provided us with his medical records.
Sutton suffered from chronic sinusitis. Note the distinctive scalloping.
now these are the X-rays from our victim's sinuses.
they match.
why is he wrapped in a shroud? Hyphantria cunea-- webworms.
the larvae spin webs over the branches to support them while they consume the foliage.
and since Sutton was caught in the leaves, he was encased. Yeah.
can you estimate how long ago they started on him? Five days, give or take.
Dr. Hodgins? Yeah?
how long is this gonna take? Yeah, it's gonna be a while.
is there an alternative? Actually, there is.
will I be sorry I asked?
Oh. I'm sorry I asked if I'll be sorry I asked. Carry on.
so, I was working up a psych profile on our victim using these.
he likes to read cheesy books.
no, no, no, he likes to write 'em.
stuff on dinosaurs, Atlantis, magnetic vortexes, the bride of Jesus.
adventurous type, huh? Adventurous types get killed all the time.
usually by jealous husbands or cannibals in New Guinea.
at what age does a kid master peek-a-boo?
okay. Gear change. Um...
if you're asking about Christine... Why the hesitation?
Mmm, it's not about Christine.
why is it when I ask you something, it's never about what I'm asking you about?
it's about Dr. Brennan. Ah, no, Sweets...
listen to me: she is very competitive, extraordinarily competitive.
if I were her parent, I would be a little concerned about the kind of pressure that that places on a growing child.
thank you.
you're welcome.
um, okay, so what Sutton does is he writes these books, and then he tries to sell the artifacts that are front and center, like dinosaur eggs, manuscripts, ancient tools and weapons, fossils, etc.
so, competition is contagious? Yeah.
you asked.
okay, I need a list of people who bought this guy's bogus artifacts.
that's my cue to get the hell out of here.
why are there still creepy-crawlies on our victim?
wait till you see this. This is gonna be fun.
what is this? Crows.
I know what they are. Why are they here?
they happen to have a voracious appetite for webworms.
they're fun, right?
let me know when I can have my tissue.
feed, my children, feed.
okay, that's not funny when you're alone. Yeah. No, that was just creepy.
okay, all right, what is she saying? She misunderstood.
she thought James died in motor vehicle accident. I told her it was not an accident.
our records show that you only came to the U. S. about a month ago.
marina and James met in Chechen Republic in village outside of Grozny.
in the mountains. Lake Kezenoyam.
they got married in Grozny, then came back here to live.
how about you? I been in U. S. five years.
first on student visa, then I graduate, find work, I live in Cleveland. I came here when James is disappeared.
so, what do you do? Engineering. This matters?
it matters, yeah.
did your husband say or do anything differently in the past few weeks?
we brought things back with us from Russia. James was...
anxiety. Also, um...
excited. It sounds like someone taking a big risk for a big reward.
what did he bring into the country? I don't know. Old things.
my sister is very sad that the man she loved will never know his child.
this is the nicest storage facility I've ever seen. Well, it's climate controlled, 24-hour security.
you store something here, you care about it.
whatever Sutton brought back from Russia must have been very valuable.
let's go find out.
okay...
it looks like he worked here, Booth.
Hey, Bones-- bones. Ha. Get it?
what are you doing? You don't know where that's been.
it's been... It's been in Russia. It's human. You can tell by licking the bone?
because of its porosity, human bone sticks to the tongue while animal bone doesn't.
no, no, no, no. There's got to be another test. You don't lick bones.
who licks bones?
this place is starting to look like a serial killer's lair.
this must be the manifesto. No...
these bones are not the victims of a serial killer.
Oh, what, you can tell that by licking them, too?
if this documentation is correct, these remains date back to Paleolithic times.
what do you mean, like, dinosaur times? No, Booth.
Homo sapiens and dinosaurs never co-existed, but...
these remains are thousands of years old.
thousands?
this is an amazing find. According to the victim's notes, all the remains were found at the same dig site near Lake Kezanoi in Chechnya.
so, Dr. Sutton might not have been such a hack after all.
just because he had them, doesn't mean he knew their importance.
all of his notes are well organized. I think he knew exactly how valuable they are.
why are you even here, Dr. Edison? He's the resident anthropologist in charge of ancient remains.
I told him to take the remains back to his lab. But this could be a very important find.
and since I have written extensively on ancient remains and was recognized by the Cambridge Archaeological Society for my work on the Lagar Velho finds,
I should be examining these. But we have a murder to solve, Dr. Brennan.
crime: you; ancient history: me-- remember?
Yes, but I would think you would want nothing more than my expertise.
and I'm well aware you would think that.
but I don't want to take you away from your murder.
could you please pack these up and take them down to 407 in the Anthropology suite, please.
no, I don't believe this. I taught you. And I'm very grateful.
I promise, you'll be thanked when I publish.
the tests on the remaining tissue showed no signs of contusions.
excuse me? - Our murder victim. From this millennium.
fine. But I just I hope that I'm available when Dr. Edison needs help.
Hey. Hi. I'm almost done.
just removing the last of the particulates that I found. Where's Dr. B?
Oh, in her office, trying to accept that Dr. Edison is in charge of the old bones.
Yeah. She'll be okay.
Yeah, that's not true. I know.
she's very competitive.- You think?
Clark has no idea what he's getting himself into. - Now, Dr. Brennan knows the boundaries.
do you really believe that? - Absolutely.
not. Can we get back to the murder?
it's so much easier to deal with.
right, so, I found some particulates embedded in the scraping wound on the back of the ribs.
any idea what it is? Well, no.
Dr. Brennan thought that there was evidence that animals might have gotten to the remains, so maybe they left them. I'll run it through the mass spec and...
Oh, man. Clark says that he needs me.
I don't want to get in between him and Dr. Brennan.
and you also have particulates to analyze, don't you?
right. Yes. Good.
thank you. I'm on it.
the last appointment that Sutton had before he died was with his publisher.
Hey, look, maybe she can give us something.
Dr. Edison is going to make a fool of himself without my help.
right, okay, are you even listening to me? What?
Oh, wow, okay. I guess not.
look, it's Clark's job. It's Clark's job, not yours.
just let it go.
do you think it's right not to have the best person analyze the remains?
maybe you're afraid that he'll do just fine without you?
excuse me? I'm just saying, it's, you know, is this about the bones or is this about you? I believe they are one and the same.
does that apply to Christine, too?
what, are you saying that I use Christine to make myself look good?
Oh, your words, not mine.
I am just saying that Clark might do things his own way and the same holds true for Christine.
shouldn't we be focusing on the case? That's a good idea.
these books Sutton wrote are dreadful. What publisher would allow such inaccuracies?
well, I'm thinking one that wanted to make money off a modern-day Indiana Jones, huh?
it's all about the cash.
I still can't believe Jim's dead.
we fixed time of death at three days ago.
when was the last time you spoke to him? Um, about a month ago.
he called from Grozny, said that he had made an important find.
we were supposed to talk about it last Friday.
did he say exactly what it was that he found in Chechnya?
no. But he was very excited, and he said that he was finally going to be able to publish something of real scientific merit.
so he knew that his previous books were sensationalistic nonsense.
bones. We preferred to view them as an accessible way for the public to get introduced to archaeology.
but an entire book on fossilized dinosaur eggs?
it was quite successful in the youth market.
the profits from these books, did they pay for his expeditions?
not exactly.
what he would do is feature an artifact in the book and then sell it. Tell you the truth.
it was almost always to the same guy.
who was this man? All I know is he's a businessman in Texas.
I never got his name. And these artifacts were legal?
I don't know. I have absolutely nothing to do with that part of the business.
25, 000 years, you'd think that they'd just have a fire pit.
Homo sapiens already had tens of thousands of years of working with fire.
the stones found at the site indicate a domed hearth.
this is all just becoming so real.
I just want to put faces on them all. Well, the skulls are there for you.
my paper would definitely be enhanced with illustrations. Hi, Angie.
I got your text. What are you doing here?
making history live, and you are gonna help. Oh, um...
I'd rather not get between Clark and Dr. Brennan.
Hodgins, we just need to know the plant and insect life in the Northern Caucasus 25, 000 years ago.
wait a minute. Wait. Are you actually afraid of Brennan?
Yeah. More than you are of me?
Epigaea gaultheroides was common, as was Betula medwedewii.
could you put that in the binder?
we tracked down the guy that Sutton sold his artifacts to. Wayne Wilson.
Texas oil money, spends a lot of time in D. C.
Wilson is a fundamentalist; he's the sole support of the country's largest Creationist museum.
so, what, are you saying he's one of those guys who believes that the world is, what, 6, 000 years old?
and yet he routinely bought artifacts from Sutton that were way older.
why would a true believer buy artifacts that he refuses to believe even exist?
perhaps he suffered a crisis of faith.
the psychological stability of the true believer rests entirely on a superior posited authority.
now, if that authority is removed or questioned...
the guy goes wacky. I was gonna use a more technical term.
that's why I interrupted you. All right, look.
according to Sutton's e-mails,
Wilson funded his entire trip and was getting angry 'cause Sutton wouldn't turn over the bones.
all right, I tell you what. You to talk to Wilson, do your shrinky thing.
see if he, you know, flipped out.
gonna do my shrinky thing. Go.
these conifers would have provided cover so that the fire wouldn't be seen by predators.
width of distal epiphyses is 3. 74 centimeters.
Dr. Brennan. Hi. You know, I was just leaving.
there would be a shelter next to the hearth made from branches and animal skins with a ground cover made of leaves.
I know. We were just getting that stuff... And moss should be used in the fire as well as wood.
I was told that you found particulates in the scraping wound on the rib, Dr. Hodgins?
Yes, yeah. Dried tissue. Some kind of hide.
um, I'm assembling a list of potential objects that could be made from it.
seems to me you're gardening.
we are in the middle of a murder investigation, Dr. Hodgins.
it's my fault. I'm sorry. I begged him.
look, this is becoming an extraordinary find. I've discovered the remains of four...
no need to explain to me, Dr. Edison.
crime is my domain; this is yours. I know, but as a fellow anthropologist,
I thought you would be interested to know that these remains are both Neanderthal and Homo sapien.
in the same site? No, I don't think so.
these pieces are from a skull of a Homo sapien male.
and we have the os coxae and various metacarpals and phalanges of a Homo sapien female.
and the rib and femur of a Neanderthal male.
this is remarkable.
and I have the femur, mandible, humerus, and skull of a female child, approximately three years old.
Yeah, it's very sad. She was only a toddler.
do you know what this means?
Homo sapiens and Neanderthals living together in the same cave, using the same resources.
look at you two, sharing. It's beautiful.
mixed tribe cohabitating. This is unprecedented.
Oh, and I do plan on crediting you, Dr. Brennan. In a secondary capacity, of course.
I believe it is I who will be crediting you in a secondary capacity, Dr. Edison.
excuse me?
the injury to the parietal was caused by a blow with a sharp weapon.
this Homo sapien was murdered, which is a crime.
so these bones are now mine.
virus has plagued the human race from the very beginning, before language, before fire.
it is the source of the Cain and Abel myth.
Yes, violence sucks, but what sucks even more is that the most fascinating thing that's ever happened to me in my career turns out to be a mere crime.
so you agree the investigation of this crime should fall to me. Oh, you would like that, wouldn't you?
Yes! That's why I suggested it. The crimes you solve are just mere current events.
this is history.
are you able to define the exact moment at which current events become history?
Yes. 100 years.- You just made that up on the spot.
this happened over 25 millennia ago, Dr. Brennan! Even you can't count that as "current events.
it does in geologic terms. Well, luckily, neither one of us is a geologist.
well, as it happens, I had a paper published by the Geological Society of America.
and I've had two published by Geophysical Systems. Which is for dilettantes and amateurs.
Oh, really? - Whoa, whoa, stop, stop.
what is going on here?
well, Dr. Brennan here feels that because these ancient individuals died in a violent manner, that somehow it's a forensic concern.
and Dr. Edison feels that history began 100 years ago.
what? That's not even an accurate representation of my meaning!
you can stop all this by simply declaring this a homicide.- Oh, no, she can't.
Yes, I can. It's a technicality, but we live in a world of technicalities.
world of technicalities.- But...
I'm not gonna do that. Clark can keep the bones here.
Dr. Brennan can have access.- No.
and if either one of you says another word, I'm gonna rule in favor of the other.
now drop the egos and figure out what happened to this poor caveman.
could you believe she just called him a caveman?
unforgivable, but I'm not saying anything else until I'm completely certain she's gone.
I can hear you.
damn.
Mr. Wilson, how long ago was the earth created?
I believe you're asking me if I believe in the Book of Genesis, which I do.
Mm-hmm, so 6, 000 years?- According to the Bible.
scientists tell us that the universe is 13 billion years old and the earth four and a half billion years old.
who you gonna believe? God or a bunch of scientists?
you own an oil company?
does God tell you where to dig or do you count on a bunch of scientists to tell you?
I get what's happening here.- What's happening here?
the FBI sent a psychologist to ask me questions because they want to know if I'm a religious fanatic.
well, I know that you're religious, sir.
what I'm trying to figure out is if your religious convictions led you to kill James Sutton.
fear them not therefore:
for there is nothing covered "that shall not be revealed, and hid that shall not be known.
book of Matthew.
thou shalt not murder.
deuteronomy.
I keep the commandments, Dr. Sweets, all ten of them.
you bought these fossilized dinosaur eggs from Sutton.
correction:
I bought those rocks from Mr. Sutton.
you also bought this figurine that Sutton found in northern Germany dated at approximately 32, 000 years.
who doesn't like a pretty girl? Plus, I love history.
I own a museum.
none of the artifacts you bought from Sutton made it in your museum.
it's my museum, Dr. Sweets. I decide what does and does not get into it.
do you destroy the items that contradict your creationist views, or do you simply lock them away where they can't do any harm?
we all do what we can do to make the world a better place.
you fronted Sutton money to go to Chechnya because he was after bones that were 25, 000 years old.
they call it the Chechen Republic now.
right, now Sutton refused to sell you what he found and for which you'd already paid, probably because he knew that you'd destroy them or lock them away.
he stole from me. That's a fact.
the Bible calls lying "bearing false witness," right?
so I have to ask, did God tell you to kill James Sutton?
you know what God is telling me right now? To get a lawyer?
see there?
the word of God is audible to all of those who listen.
why are you so depressed? You run out of your marshmallows?
well, my happy tribe theory is kaput.
the Homo sapien male was clearly murdered by a Neanderthal axe.
what have you got there?
my sketches of people who lived 25, 000 years ago.
wow, these are good. You can see us in them.
Yeah. We could be looking at our own family, right?
no.- Because this family stopped here?
Yes.- You don't know that.
there could have been a brother out hunting that day or a sister gathering nuts and...
I don't actually know what people did for a living back then, so...
this is wrong.- No, I don't think so.
this child is way too short for a Homo sapien three-year-old, especially compared to the height of the two Homo sapien parents.
well, I got the measurement from you, Clark, so if anybody's wrong, I think it was you.
the only way a Homo sapien child could be this short and stocky is if she inherited traits from...
Oh, my God.- Wh-What?
the shorter, thicker tibia is more suited to a Neanderthal than a human, which can only mean that... That the child is Neanderthal.
half Neanderthal. Well, yeah, but then her father isn't her father.
this is her father.- See, that's not... I mean, I don't think that...
I'm freaking out right now. Is this a new thing?
Yeah, Angela. This is a new thing.
Dr. Brennan? - Yes?
you seem to be looking at both Sutton's remains and his notes.
that's accurate. Those are two different cases.
one's a murder from a few days ago. The other is a murder from 25, 000 years ago.
Yes.
Dr. Brennan, I know the Neanderthal case is historic and exciting, but this man was murdered, and he left behind a widow and a fatherless child.
I think we should find out who did it.
I've catalogued the injuries to the ribs and spine.
Yes, there are traces of animal tissue in the bone.
when I was in the Maldives,
I examined the remains of a woman who'd been tied to a tree and whipped for cheating on her husband.
you think the animal tissue is leather?
Yes, I believe that approximately two months before he was killed, Dr. Sutton was flogged.
I think I found it.
Yeah, I got this from the Russian history room.
it's called a knout in English, pronounced "ka-noot" in Russian.
here's an interesting fact.
most Germanic languages still pronounce the silent K.
so knight is "ka-night," knife is "ka-nife."- Fascinating.
so you think this is what Sutton was beaten with?- Flogged.
Oh, yeah. The tissue was a tanned hide.
Leather?- Um, yeah, it was from a Siberian musk-ox.
now, I ran it through the isotopic mass spec and was able to isolate the geographic origin to the Chechen Republic in Russia.
that's the area where his dig was. Yeah, what did you find?
well, I have tissue samples from his back.
there's scarring on them that indicates that the flogging took place about two months ago.
which would definitely place him in Chechnya.
the areas of impact on the flesh are pale with abrasions, bruising along both sides.
it's amazing that he survived a beating like this.- His wife was pregnant.
he had something to live for.
I'm surprised your brother didn't come with you this time.- He's working.
Mrs. Sutton, I know this is difficult, but telling us what happened to your husband might help us find who killed him.
are you in danger?- No, no, no.
you know, he was flogged. He was whipped, you understand?
who did that to him?
our son will be named Valentine.
is that name significant in some way?- Yes, it is a family name.
my family is, um...
I'm sorry. I don't understand.- Do things the old way.
Oh, traditional.
okay, your family didn't want you to marry a foreigner, but you're pregnant.
your father had Sutton whipped.
we got to Grozny.
hide.
James, when he gets better, we come here, to America.
now, is it possible that your father followed you here?
no.
I have dishonored my family.
I am dead to him, and now I can't go home.
and James is gone.
may I help you, Dr. Brennan? Dr. Edison, no.
I knocked, but I haven't touched anything. It's okay.
you can examine anything you want. I should have spotted it earlier, but apparently I was too busy competing with you to really see anything.
the child's large, pronounced brow ridge is characteristically Neanderthal while the radius and ulna appear to be Homo sapien.
I was stunned myself. I thought Angela made a mistake.
not Angela.
this was an inter-species family, the first of its kind, and I didn't take the time to notice.- Yeah, but you trained me to...
congratulations belong to you, deservedly so, Dr. Edison.
thank you.
it's no wonder Sutton didn't want to give these up.
I know. I never thought I'd be part of a discovery like this.
well, you probably wouldn't if you hadn't been trained so well.
I'll let you get back to work.- Okay.
initially, I thought all of these markings came from predators, but look at this. The nick on the coracoid process.
that's not from a predator?- The teeth would have to be very small.
and young predators don't usually feed with adults. The adults bring the food back to them.
this injury had to have been caused by a weapon of some kind.
the coracoid process could only be exposed if the arm was raised.
as if the victim were warding off an attack. The first blow must have been to the scapula.
which caused this indentation here.
then the victim turns to face the assailant, raises his arm in a defensive posture...
the murder weapon nicks the coracoid process, then travels downward into the armpit, slicing the axillary artery.
he died of exsanguination.- Exsanguination.
a completely severed axillary would pump about 100ccs of blood per heartbeat.
at that rate, the victim would have lost consciousness in less than 30 seconds.
and died in under a minute.- Dr. Brennan, I do believe we found cause of death.
Yes. Together.
so, you were VDV in the Russian Army?- I'm a patriot. So?
that's like our Special Forces. I'm sure you were taught how to target major arteries in hand-to-hand combat?
I know how to defend myself.
right. According to your bank account, there's some major withdrawals in the past three months.
one bigger than the other. You like to gamble?
I play the horses once in a while. Yeah, I know. I've been there.
when you bet, you lose, you get desperate. You bet more just to get that rush.
I don't know what you're talking about.- No? I mean, you were broke two weeks ago.
then you get this.
electronic transfer from a Russian bank for $20, 000.
someone paid off an old debt.- It's possible.
I could see that, but do you want to hear my theory? I'm thinking you come here and you want to make it big.
but you fall into debt, so what do you do? You go to Daddy to bail you out, and he agrees on one condition.
to restore the family honor, you had to take out your sister's husband.
you shouldn't talk about my family like that.
I can see that family means a lot to you.
you would do anything to protect their honor, am I right?- I know my rights.
and I don't have to talk to you anymore.
so the nick to the coracoid process revealed microscopic fibers of a dyed and coated linen.
parts of the victim's clothing?- No, because...
the linen has been suffused with polyurethane.
I don't know what that means. Well, it's... I know what it means, obviously.
what I don't understand is its significance. Bookbinding.
how could a book cut through the muscle tissue and sever a major artery?
I guess we're looking for something that's covered in bookbinder's linen that's sharper than a book.
that is correct. I know what killed James Sutton.- Wh-wha...
would you care to share it with me?- I have to get Booth.
Nope, yeah, okay.
I'll just find out later.
just because I don't have an alibi does not mean that I killed Jim.
doesn't exactly clear you either.- These books.
what about them?- They cover a wide range of topics that would've been useful in this killing.
really, like what? This book is about how to commit the perfect murder.
why would you publish something like that?- It's written by a man on death row.
how could he possibly be an expert on the perfect murder?
what else we got here? Oh, oh, look at this.
you missed one, Bones. How to Remove Stains.
there's blood on the floor here. I bet it says to use bleach on blood.
that doesn't work. You publish trash.- I cut my foot on a rock in the garden.
it bled a lot. I estimate about two liters.
two liters-- I'm surprised you didn't pass out. Okay, I'm sorry.
the bookends-- they come in pairs?- I only ever had one.
Really? Not in this picture you didn't I see two.
this is a likely match for the indentation on the posterior surface of Sutton's scapula.
so you're saying that I killed Jim with a bookend?
that's ludicrous.
DNA will tell us if the blood on the floor matches Sutton's.
it's only a matter of time. You come clean with us, I'll tell the judge you cooperated.
when he called me from Russia, I could hear it in his voice. Something changed.
he'd fallen in love.- Oh, no.
it was never about her. We were a team.
until he decided to publish in some ridiculous journal for no pay.
and leave me out of it. He betrayed me.
he wanted to be taken seriously as an archeologist, which is a very high calling.
you should've let him have that.
well, you're under arrest for the murder of Dr. James Sutton.
Hello, everybody.
we are extremely gratified that there are so many people who are interested in what happened 25, 000 years ago.
even the FBI is interested. It was a crime.
well, FBI's all about crime, so can we get going here?
but I think this is Clark's story to tell. Dr. Edison.
okay, all right, yes, uh... Are you gonna let Clark have all this glory?
he put it together. I only helped.
Dr. Hodgins, would you stand in for the Neanderthal father?
Yes. Dr. Saroyan,
would you be the Homo sapien mother?
and, um...
no. No?
don't even think about it.
okay, Dr. Sweets, would you be our interloper?
okay. All right, gentlemen, Could you go this way and I'll call you when I need you.
it was a warmish morning in the late fall in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains.
excuse me... if I may? Oh, boy.
how do you know it was a warmish morning?
uh, spores and fungi tell us that it was a very warm autumn.
ha, bug boy.
mom was grinding acorns into paste between rocks.
the grinding rocks were a part of Sutton's find, as were some acorn husks.
a very warm autumn.
Yes. Now, there was a little girl, only three years old who was sleeping under some skins here in the shelter.
which is our cue for Dad to come in with dinner.
right, good.
hark, I bring thee meat with we thus shall feast upon and... Hey, honey, it's not Shakespeare.
right, yes, good, sorry. Um, um, rah, caveman.
please don't say "caveman." Please don't say "caveman.
this is not a family like others.
they were outcasts. This family lived apart because they were not accepted.
time for the interlope.- What do I do?
throw your spear at Dad.- Why?
we found a greenstick fracture on the father's left ninth rib that is consistent with the ballistic trajectory of a thrown weapon.
Homo sapiens were the first to throw a spear at their prey rather than simply jab at it.
well, Homo sapiens can go straight to hell then. Oh, everyone in this room's Homo sapien.
not me-- I'm Neanderthal.
mom then attacked the interloper with her grinding stone. fracturing his left humerus.
he then retaliated by striking her in the face, and down Mom went with a broken jaw and very likely a crushed larynx, but her actions gave Dad time to pick up his stone hatchet...
...and strike the interloper.
dude, lie down. You're dead.
I'm not gonna lie down. Well, you should.
I just split your skull wide open. Okay, all right, we got it.
the bad guy is dead. What happened next?
as I was saying, the interloper was killed instantly.
the father bled out in less than three minutes.
what happened to the mother? Her larynx was crushed.
she suffocated to death.
okay, but the little girl-- she was okay, right?
no, actually, she was only three years old, and...
she was all alone.- What the hell?
why didn't the other villagers take her in?- Because she was half-Homo sapien and half-Neanderthal.
no one wanted her.
the lines of arrest on the child's teeth indicate that she starved to death.
wow, so you're saying the world's first hate crime ended with the starvation of a little girl?
no, Booth, it doesn't end in hate.
no, before he died, Dad crawled over to the mom where they died together, and then...
the little girl's last action was to come over... and lie down with her parents.
which is how Sutton found the bones.
together.
you know that was really nice of you to let Clark have his moment, Bones.
well, I'm a very nice person.- Yes, you are, but you know what?
you're very nice. You're gonna work on your modesty now.
well, I am being modest because I actually did something even nicer.
Oh, really? What was that?
I told Clark to replace my authorship credit with Dr. James Sutton
that way, one day Sutton's son will see what a great discovery he made.
you're right: it was very nice.
I don't want to pass my failings onto Christine, Booth.
what failings? Hyper-competitiveness, arrogance, insensitivity to the feelings of others.
you know what? Thumbs-up for self-realization there, Bones.
actually, two thumbs up.
you should make a similar effort.
what? Not to pass on your failings.
what do you mean? What failings?- Oh, it's time for bed.
now, wh-what failings?- You know. We're gonna have a bath.
we'll get your jammies on.- What, is this because I won't walk under ladders?
we'll have some milk, wash your hair.- Oh. What is it, my sweet tooth?
yeah.- So I like to have a beer every once in a while in the bathtub.
what's so bad about that? What failings?
I'm not a criminal, I'm a hacktivist.
christopher Pelant, socially marginalized,
I. Q. off the charts...
this will show that I never left my house.
he made a cipher out of spine. And he wrote malware on bone.
I think he can get around an ankle monitor.
he's not a hacker anymore. Now he's a murderer.
as far as any government agency is concerned,
Pelant is clean, Seeley.
I know this man. Pelant killed my friend.
he's framing you.
the evidence is piling up against Brennan.
you gotta make a run for it, honey.
he thinks he's smarter than us.
that big brain of yours isn't much help now, hmm?
if we can just figure out how he put her in the security footage, - we can clear her. - You got him.
christopher Pelant, you are under arrest.
even a genius can make a few mistakes.
what did you mean when you said Pelant is not Pelant?
that man is Basam Alfayat.
you're saying that he wiped out his identity and created a new one?
that's right. Pelant isn't Pelant anymore. We can't touch him.
Oh, God...
come here, baby. Come here.
come here, come here.
angel said they were drugged. - How?
gas. Hodgins found a hole in the vent to their bedroom.
what else did they tell you? - To get Christine somewhere safe.
well, your father's... he-he's not gonna let her out of his sight, all right?
angel was scared. I've never heard her like this before.
she says that we're the only ones she trusts with this.
trusts with what?
she thinks Pelant is back.
the skin was almost completely removed.
as was the mandible, the internal and sexual organs...
the superior lateral corner of the eye orbits indicates the victim was male.
was it Pelant?
come on-- who else would cut someone up like this?
the technique used on these tissue incisions could help determine that.
cam would be the one to assess it.
assess what?
look at it-- it's Pelant.
I'm not saying it isn't. - We need proof.
here, here-- he left these petals in Michael's crib.
they're from Egypt. Crocus Sativus.
the Egyptians revered the crocus as a symbol of the rebirth of the sun.
Yeah, and last we knew, Pelant was in Egypt.
flaying and flowers... Okay, that settles it; it's Pelant.
Pelant is back from Egypt. The real question is why.
I almost killed him a few months ago. He's trying to get back at me.
well, that definitely factors into it, but with Pelant, there's always something more.
we can't keep Cam out of this. We have to examine this cadaver in the lab.
call the Bureau and get a tech team out here.
wait, no, no-- no, no teams.
no one can know about this but us. - That's not how I work.
the game has changed, Booth. Pelant is targeting us, directly.
we have to hit him back now, before one of us is dead.
Pelant touched our son.
isn't there a way to just get rid of him?
morally, I have no problem with killing a killer, but Booth is the only one of us who has the skills and the training to do it.
the burden would fall on him. The decision needs to be his.
how many kills do you have?
my kills were battlefield decisions, all right?
they were green-lit from above. There is a chain of command.
did any deserve to die more than Pelant?
we stay in the system.
in lockdown, but in the system. That's final.
are we good?
Yeah, we're good.
all right, I'm going to call a tech team now.
I'll call Cam.
are you all right?
Yeah.
it's an EFT shield. Military-grade, counter-surveillance.
same idea as a tin foil hat.
that is a lot of highly-trained squints expertise you are sending on government - paid vacation.
the investigation is need-to-know only.
all calls are on burner cells; no computers.
I've got as much blood as you've got tests.
potentiometer assay, gamma count, Don't leave anything out.
okay, ooh, there is a needle in your radial artery, Dr. Hodgins.
try not to bounce around so much.
you are running a gamma count, aren't you?
if the hematology warrants it.
gamma count gives us the GGT levels, okay?
those puppies bark loud enough, we're gonna know Pelant used Phenobarbital to knock me and Angela out.
now, if we can I. D. the gas, we may be able to narrow it down to the supplier.
and that's gonna get us one step closer to Pelant.
well, that is how a forensic investigation works.
Yeah, just trying to help.
don't you have flower petals to examine?
Hey, if I'm in your way, just say so.
petals. Go.
I just don't understand how someone can do this to another human being.
Oh, you'd have to have a strong knowledge of anatomy, a well-balanced cutting implement being.
that really holds its edge; a floor drain would be helpful.
that clears it up. Thank you.
what do we have?
victim is male, 185. 4 centimeters tall, 56. 7 kilograms, without skin, bodily fluids, mandible, or viscera.
so, that puts his original weight at 210, give or take a mandible or two.
the wear to the maxillary teeth suggests late 30s.
the width of the fourth sternal rib indicates Caucasian ancestry.
lack of putrefaction suggests he's been dead less than 24 hours, so Missing Persons won't have anything yet.
Pelant is sending us a message.
there has to be some logic to these cuts.
the selective flaying, the missing mandible, I'm just... not seeing it.
what about the X rays?
there were some small lesions to the scapula.
and some fragments embedded in the muscle near the victim's pelvis.
Yeah, it looks like the iliacus.
what are those?
I'm not sure, but muscle remodeling indicates they've been in there over a year.
okay, I'll get these to Dr. Hodgins.
cam is treating this like it's just any other case.
no, she's just being professional.
Brennan, Pelant was holding Michael in his arms.
when... when I was on the road with Christine, I was scared.
Yeah, of course you were. You were alone.
no, you don't understand. I've been alone most of my life.
I've never been scared. This... this was different.
how did you get through it?
I've met victims of war crimes in Central America, Africa, Southeast Asia, they've gone through a lot more than us.
they manage to keep going by finding something to focus on;
a clear achievable goal that gets them through the day.
I could use one of those. You got one for me?
stopping Pelant.
christopher Pelant, born in 1986, in Denmark, raised in United States until he wipes out that identity and becomes Egyptian National Basam Alfayat.
right-- now, all records of Alfayat have now vanished, too.
so we have no idea who we are looking for.
first victim was Carol Morissey.
Pelant's high school guidance counselor.
she was going to write him a bad recommendation to Stanford, so he killed her. It was utilitarian.
he disposed of the body... - ...and got into Stanford.
word is, that's what it takes these days.
next, is was Inger Johannsen and Ezra Krane.
now, here we see concurrent patterns.
Pelant had no personal connection to Inger, and a minimal one to Krane.
he opportunistically used their bodies to tell the story.
then we have good old Ethan Sawyer, who Pelant immobilized, so he could be eaten by wolves.
I'll say this for the evil little troll:
so, what's he up to with his latest?
does Flynn know about this? - He's an FBI agent, he figures things out.
Hey. What's going on? - FBI work.
does this FBI work have anything to do with Pelant?
Pelant-- he doesn't exist.
no, we're looking at a killing done by an individual who manifests a malignant antisocial personality disorder.
it helps to pull up old cases to compare, that's all.
thank you for the insight.
I run the major crimes here, and I'm investigating one, so...
I'd hate to have to drop a report on the H. E.'s desk that you were getting in the way.
that sort of politics appalls me.
fine.
Seeley, run your investigation.
it's just that, if I were you, I'd want all the help that I could get.
but I'm not you.
I did some reconstructions.
wow, three sets.
Yeah, since there's no mandible, there's just an element of uncertainty here.
these lesions on the scapula are most likely the remnants of a case of cutaneous leishmaniasis.
well, that's not a domestic disease.
but I've seen it on soldiers.
the troops in Iraq get it from sand flea bites.
Oh, well, that makes sense.
Hodgins thinks the metal fragments you gave him are shrapnel.
he's doing a compositional analysis to determine the source.
stress fractures to the victim's metatarsals were consistent with parachute jumping, and...
there are osteophytes present in the intercondylar fossa of the femur, which comes from nitrogen buildup in the blood.
which could mean he did a significant amount of diving.
diving, parachute training, and shrapnel wound.
sounds like our victim was Special Forces.
I hear the lab thinks your victim was Special Forces.
okay, why do you want any part of this?
this is nothing but a headache for you, right?
whatever. That's the job, right?
I'm offering my help.
classified -- DO NOT COPY
but if you don't want it...
that doesn't leave the Pentagon. How did you get these records?
called in a favor. - It must have been some favor.
the guy you're looking for served in Iraq, built up major dive hours, and managed to get wounded by an RPG in Central Africa.
well, if he pulled an assignment in Africa, that would be off the record.
exactly. That's why we've never seen these.
you still want me off this one?
Ah, it's too late for that.
I just heard from Leah Kressin.
she is the best hematologist I know, top expert in her field.
I completely trust her work, and...
she couldn't I. D. the gas that Pelant used. I'm sorry.
but you're not giving up on this, right?
well... I don't know what else to do.
there's no residue in your blood, there's no residue on the victim.
the tech team went over every inch of your place.
well, then they go over it again. I mean, every millimeter.
someone missed something.
given the time and resources we have,
I have to go with what has the highest probability of...
if it's about resources, just tell me how much you need me to give you.
money isn't the issue. - Please. Money is always the issue.
it's a good thing that I'm rich.
half the funding for the Jeffersonian comes from the Cantilever Group.
we have to stay focused on what's important.
he was in my bedroom.
he threatened my wife, my child.
nothing is more important than that.
Xavier Freeman-- did five tours as a SEAL, mustered out in 2008. Nothing on him since.
well, not many SEALs worked both Central Africa and Iraq, you know.
he's the only hit Flynn and I could find.
no job, no surviving family.
then I guess we won't have to notify anyone.
new furniture.
hardly any food in the fridge.
no movies, music, books.
looks like he's got a family, after all.
I saw this exact same photo in an apartment I almost rented.
Yeah.
see, stagers cut these out of magazines to prep open houses.
freeman didn't want to form any attachments.
he was ready to leave at any time.
there's a lot of hotel receipts here from Cairo, Dubai...
wait, wait...
look at this. He... left his gun locker open.
no, he didn't. A SEAL would never do that.
Pelant wanted us to find this open.
these are all proprietary weapons.
I've seen some of these weapons in Iraq, but our boys, they never got this kind of stuff.
who does? - The ones who kill for money, that's who.
it's Booth. Listen, our man Freeman, he was working for Serberus.
you know what we're in for? - Yeah.
what's Serberus?
it's the world's biggest provider of mercenaries.
not only do they supply the arms, but... they supply the men who use them.
so Pelant killed a highly-trained professional soldier.
a target like that is a huge risk, even for him. He's escalating.
Yeah, but the question is why.
I ran a tox screen--no poisons, but I found highly elevated levels of adrenocorticosteroids.
have you found any signs of... torture?
look at these antemortem striations on the fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae.
they were made by needles.
that would have pierced the nerve ganglions on either side of the vertebrae.
the pain would be intense, but it-it wouldn't kill him.
not in one session, but this could've gone on for days.
the body would continue to pump out adrenaline, stressing his heart until he suffered a lethal bradyarrhythmia.
he literally died from pain.
Xavier Freeman was tortured and killed by a man we're tracking.
so we'd like Freeman's records. Every operation that he's had access to.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
it's company policy to maintain the confidentiality of our operatives.
this is your company. I mean, you can change that policy with one phone call.
that's not going to happen.
I don't think you understand Mr. Molnor
our target's killed five people already. He's on the hunt.
I think I understand very well
you had five shots at this guy, and you missed every time.
now you want my help.
if he's the one who killed our man, we'll find out.
by ourselves.
Hey. Got a minute? - For what, Sweets?
you've been through a lot. Thought you might want to talk.
I mean, you suffered a major trauma.
okay, I get it, I get it-- "trauma," "stress"
these are just buzzwords because you think that I'm not up to my job.
listen, you've got to calm down, okay? Let the team do its job.
look, I know you think that because you choked Pelant you brought all this down on your family...
okay, thank you for stopping by.
this isn't you, Hodgins, all right? Y-You need some perspective.
just... take a breath.
take a breath.
take a breath.
take a breath.
what?
I'm sorry to tell you this, but there's nothing in the Justice's guidelines on searches, seizures, and practical jokes that will get you back into Serberus with a warrant if you can't tell me what you're looking for.
we can't tell you what we're looking for until we go back there and find it.
you have no idea what Freeman was working on? - No, none.
come on, Caroline. It's just a piece of paper.
you think I can just foxtrot into a judge's chambers with my winning smile and girlish figure and get whatever I want?
I appreciate the compliment, cherie, but it doesn't work that way.
you know what? You don't want to help? Fine.
you can just foxtrot out of here.
Pelant screwed me over, too. I want him as badly as you do.
so you come back with something I can work with and I will get you that warrant.
Dr. Sweets. What is it?
I just spoke with Dr. Hodgins, and I'm concerned about him.
you need to check with me in advance before you assess any of my people.
that wasn't my intention, okay? He's a friend, he suffered a shock.
and yet you feel compelled to see me about it.
he's obsessive.
he's manic, he's not evincing good judgment.
I don't think it's healthy for Hodgins or this investigation for him to be working right now.
you should just... send him home. Let him get some rest.
I'm not gonna do that. - Why?
because Pelant is afraid of Jack Hodgins.
that's why he put the body in his house.
he wants him off the case.
what are you doing? - Snorting lidocaine.
Why?
suppresses the gag reflex. I need to biopsy my lung.
Oh, no, no, no. No, you don't.
No-Nobody biopsies their own lung.
there is a chance that some of the gas Pelant used on us is still in the tissue.
then let Cam do it. I mean, she's an MD.
I don't think she trusts my professional opinion right now.
besides, it's-it's, it's painful, there's a risk of complications, and there's only this slim chance that it's even gonna work.
but there is actually... a chance?
maybe. The odds aren't good.
let's double them. Biopsy my lung, too.
booth. - Guess again, Dr. Brennan.
what do you want?
I want to register my disappointment with you.
I left you a masterpiece of a body, and you still haven't read it properly.
then why don't you just tell me what it means?
I already have-- you just don't get it yet.
which surprises me, frankly.
I mean, yeah, maybe it's true what they say about motherhood.
what are you talking about? - That it makes you dumber.
you didn't just call to insult me. Tell me what you want.
I'm not telling you anything, Temperance.
but... as a goodwill gesture, one neurological freak to another, - I'll give you a hint. - What's the hint?
you'll know soon enough.
no time for a trace. What did he say?
that he sent me something. A clue.
mailroom
Oh, gah...!
the finger was mailed to the Jeffersonian, and Pelant knew how to reach me on my burner cell.
how? - I don't know, but he knows I haven't figured out his code on the victim's remains yet.
that's not good. He's unscrambled our signal.
is that human?
it'll take me some time to do a proper analysis.
right, well, I'm staying right here with you.
you don't need to protect me, Booth.
Pelant doesn't want to kill me, at least for now.
if that's supposed to make me feel better, it doesn't.
just go. I'll be fine.
all right. You need me, just call.
you okay? - Yeah. Fine.
Ah, nothing beats old-school technology. It's beautiful, isn't it?
what is that? - It's an Enigma machine.
the Germans used them to send coded messages in World War II.
this one was my grandfather's.
there's only one other, and I just had it sent to Booth.
from now on, any important information we have for the FBI goes over it.
okay, uh, Booth said that we could set up a proprietary landline.
no, no, no. Ph-Phones run on the power supply.
Pelant could've sent a... a worm in through the grid.
honey, that is not possible.
of course it's possible. I can't believe that you're questioning that.
wait a minute. I just let you cut out a piece of my lung.
every breath that I'm taking feels like I swallowed an ice pick.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
it's okay. I-I get it, I get it.
mass spec's warmed up.
did you get anything?
carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, nitrous oxide...
a few stray molecules of C4, H3, F7, O1.
okay, what-what does that mean?
Sevoflurane-- it's an anesthetic gas.
it's the one that Pelant used to knock us out.
I bet he figured we could never trace it.
Oh, this is our one advantage. Thank God I am a pack rat.
there are two suppliers who are licensed to sell the amount of sevo Pelant used to fill our bedroom.
okay. So?
they're both divisions of Cantilever. I own them.
I'm gonna take care of this one myself.
taxonomy puts it at primate to start, but the knuckles indicate the suborder is simian.
the finger belongs to a monkey or an ape.
nail is flat, indicates the family Cercopithecidae, which limits the geographic range to Northern Africa.
the hair follicles indicate genus macaque.
relation of the proximal to the distal phalanges indicates... Macaca Sylvanus.
commonly known as a Barbary ape.
well, and it's an index finger. That's got to have some significance.
Pelant said that he left me a "masterpiece.
the Roman anatomist Galen dissected Barbary apes as his models for how the human body works.
his work was widely accepted until the 16th century, when Vesalius, the father of modern anatomy, proved that Galen had made some significant errors.
we have to show Angela.
that finger was pointing us to Vesalius.
okay, so this is the best I could do without my usual tools.
I'm impressed.
this is the body from above our bed.
now, I went through all of Vesalius's illustrations and found the one that most closely resembles...
plate 34-- De Humani Corporis Fabrica.
both corpses are flayed, eviscerated, missing mandibles.
but the bodies are positioned so differently, it's difficult to make a comparison.
well, Vesalius looped a rope around the back of the cranium and up through the orbital cavity to pull the body up to a standing position.
so I did the same with the photo.
they're almost an identical match. But what does it mean?
I don't know what he's trying to tell us, but...
I'm pretty sure the guy's enjoying this.
I'm not seeing what you're seeing.
Pelant's been deliberately macabre before. But this is artistic.
you know, there's ego gratification here. He's building to something.
something's burning.
what the hell is that?
it's an Enigma machine-- Hodgins sent it over.
Why? - Why? Because it's Hodgins.
it looks like it's actually working. What does it say?
traced Pelant's gas supplier,"Bertand Chemical.
has new alias. Justin Trimple.
what kind of name is that?
Pelant always has to be singular, even with his fake identities.
I'll run it through the database.
it's got to be a paper search, no computers. - Come on.
we don't have a choice. If we run it, Pelant will know.
fine. There's another way we can find him. Pelant won't see it coming.
Flynn says that we should spam Pelant?
you know, that's so low-tech, it might actually work.
how? - Permission to use?
no.
listen, Pelant might flag a search for the name, but if we blast him with spam, it could distract him just long enough for us to run a check on Trimple before Pelant can suspect that we're in.
angela thinks it'll work.
okay. - Okay.
and the neat thing is, some helpful Nigerian has already written all the spam for us.
why won't Pelant know you're sending it?
I'll route it through a proxy chain and send it to every possible Justin Trimple.
76 NEW EMAILS
excuse me for one minute.
he blocked us. - Oh, that's bad.
no. It's good. Tell Booth I know what server he's using.
the lab traced Justin Trimple to the in-house server at Serberus.
that's Pelant, right? He's there right now?
Yes. When he killed Freeman he took his security chip.
that's what got him access.
what do you have to tie him to Freeman's murder?
the start of the chain, okay?
Hodgins has got a eyewitness who sold him massive amounts of sevoflurane gas.
that's the stuff he used to knock 'em out.
you trust Hodgins with this?
Yes.
listen to me. We may not catch another break here
we need to go in there with a tac team and take him now.
look, I need that warrant.
you want to take on a private army with an FBI tac squad?
Yeah. - Yes.
you come up empty, and I will not be there to cover your sorry asses on account of I'll be too busy covering my own, understood?
I'll take that chance. - Great.
okay, then. Suit up.
right. So, how we doing?
we've got Gatlings at each entry and exit. 6, 000 rounds per minute.
they're hidden behind grates.
first order of business, we get him offline, and make sure we get every man past the kill zone.
what are you doing here? - I want to go in with you.
no. - I can help you in there; I understand Pelant.
you're staying outside. - Doesn't make any sense.
it makes complete sense, because if I go in there and I don't make it out, you're the only one who understands Pelant, how he ticks.
you're gonna have to be the one that follows through with all this
I need to know you'll be there for me if that happens.
okay. Okay, I'll be here.
right. Over here.
freeman's corpse is not a perfect copy of the Vesalius.
Pelant made some errors.
what kind of errors? - The cuts.
some of them are identical, but others don't correspond.
if those aren't errors, but purposeful anomalies, then the deviation between the two would be his code.
clear the lobby! Everybody move!
lock down every exit, get those Gatlings offline. - Roger that.
sweep every room from the ground up.
over here.
move! Move! Let's go!
FBI. Weapons on the ground.
guys... seriously?
stand down.
Pelant excised pieces of several muscles from Freeman's corpse that are intact in the Vesalius.
teres major, middle scalene, rhomboid major, brachioradialis, omohyoid, iliocostalis lumborum.
can you magnify the Vesalius?
he labeled each muscle with a different letter.
those letters match up perfectly with the holes.
M-E-L- Y-C-U. What does it mean?
everybody out! Move! Move!
quickly! Let's go! Everyone to the lobby! Keep moving!
remote Systems Armed - FBI! - Let's go. Out.
do you have any idea what you're doing?
Yeah, saving your ass.
team B headed to the server room.
connection Lost - Clear! - Server room clear!
out of 720 combinations, this is the only one that makes sense.
lyceum. - It's the only one that makes sense.
what does it mean? - It means school.
derived from the Greed Lukeion, where Aristotle taught.
right. But what does it mean to Pelant?
if Pelant's in the building, he'll show up on a security camera.
got him.
no, we don't. He can't be everywhere at once.
we've got every exit covered.
we don't. There's another way out.
building like this there's always an off-map evac route. Where is it?
Pelant could crash this whole place down. He's got the tool set.
you lose contact with all 5, 000 of your special guys out there for God knows how long, how's that gonna go over with your clientele?
it's not in the blueprints. He couldn't know about it.
he knows.

down!
stay with me, okay? Just stay with me.
agent down. Agent down.
Hey, you okay?
I just had to tell the squints that Pelant got away.
my last shot-- it hit Pelant.
all right, it hit him. It didn't kill him, but there was damage.
you couldn't have seen that shot hit Pelant.
I hit him.
if that's so, he's gonna need medical attention, right?
there's already an all-points.
there's no way he gets away this time.
if it was anyone else, I'd believe you, but...
agent Booth? - What's going on?
every work station on the eighth floor just went on.
Why? - I don't know.
all right, bring it up for me.
here we are. Here it is.
what are those numbers? - I have no idea.
booth just called.
we're back online, and I'm patched into the Serberus system.
you need to see what it's doing.
it's got to be a code. - Of course it's a code. It's Pelant.
he's showing us he still controls the board.
it's not a series, not a sequence, not a progression.
there's no mathematical consistency here.
they have to correlate to something.
wait a second. I recognize these numbers from Afghanistan.
they're coordinates on the MGRS.
what's that? - Military Grid Reference System.
GPS standard for air-delivered weapons. That means Pelant has got a target.
the coordinates are for Kandahar Province.
the landscape is shifting at 237 miles per hour.
is that speed constant? - Yeah.
too slow for a missile or a jet. Too fast for a copter.
it's an MQ-9 Predator Drone.
target? - Uh, no idea.
this is Pelant. We have to assume the worst.
the MQ-9 carries enough ordnance to take out a city block.
any habitable area in the vicinity would be densely populated.
a hit would be devastating. Booth!
you got to turn this drone around now.
redirect the drone.
I can't get onto its nav. We're locked out.
the drone's system has been corrupted.
attempt TO CONNECT FAILED
it won't acknowledge anything I send it.
try "Lyceum.
we've got the drone's video feed.
can you get us a satellite image of the nearest populated area?
Yeah.
the drone's flight path will take it directly to those buildings.
what are those dots? - They're head scarves. They're girls.
I'm enhancing.
they're young. Based on the size differentials, they're pre-teens.
lyceum. Pelant is taking out a school.
okay, what's that other data that he's throwing at us?
okay, I'll work on that. You stay on the drone.
wait a second-- why is Pelant giving us the target in advance? He doesn't do that.
he wants us to feel helpless when the drone blows up that school.
you have any other aircraft in the area? - Do we?
navy has a pair of Hornets in flight, 93 miles out.
request a redeploy.
Oh, my God.
this can't be happening.
Oh, God. No, no, no.
what? What-what is it?
that word "salad" is the passwords to my accounts
personal portfolio, corporate, the works.
Pelant-- he's draining every account. We'll be broke in a minute.
no, no, no. It's running off of Serberus's network; I can shut it down.
no, you can't, Angie. You can't. - Why not?
because if you shut down Serberus, we're gonna lose contact with the drone.
Pelant is forcing me to choose.
keep our money, or save those girls.
Oh, my God.
save the girls. Go.
drone is one minute out. - Hornets?
five minutes and counting. - They're not gonna make it.
Pelant sequestered his kernel with direct anonymous attestation.
Meaning?
I'm in.

got it.
been looking for you.
it suddenly hit me, I haven't eaten all day.
how long have those been here?
well, absence of bug infestation indicates less than two days.
and I am not about to turn down a free muffin.
not now, anyway.
you know, we're gonna be all right. We don't need the money.
I know.
but it was a lot of money.
it sure was.
you know, there's a bag of frozen bagels downstairs.
it's been there for weeks.
Really? Oh, that's our breakfast.
love you. - I love you, too.
how's Flynn?
he's stabilized, but we still don't know.
I didn't get a chance to say good night to her.
it's about more than that, isn't it, Booth?
Pelant is still out there.
you said you hit him. If he's injured, that helps us.
but we're still waiting for him to make the next move, and I'm not okay with that.
whatever's next, we'll handle it.
we always do.
central said a motorist called in a possible B and E.
who the hell breaks into an old slaughterhouse?
I don't know.
I think the desk sergeant is screwing with us, man.
I heard he sends rookies out on bogus calls.
just in case, keep your eyes open.
I don't want any surprises.
dispatch, this is Officer Szerik.
Hamilton and I have the suspects.
what the hell are you doing, man?
he screws with us, we screw with him.
this is dispatch. Officer Szerik, do you need backup?
Nah, just a couple of guys with pit bulls and automatic weapons.
nothing we can't handle.
you're such an asshat.
look, this is the only way to get respect, man.
trust me.
I don't want any part of this, man.
you do what you want.
I'm going to check over here.
you okay, Hamilton?
officer Szerik, are you all right?
Oh, man, this smells.
What...?
what the hell did I fall in?
repeat, are you all right, Officer Szerik?
what is it?
what is it?
I'm sending backup.
Szerik·Hamilton, are you there?
the remains were found in an abattoir?
"Slaughterhouse" is fine, okay?
french doesn't make murder any classier.
it is a very good place to dispose of a body; the equipment's all there.
it's amazing, you know. You always look on the bright side of life, don't you?
I try. Yeah.
Oh, Christine's baby group is later this morning, if you want to take her.
I would, but, I,uh... I have to go to the hospital.
Oh, I didn't-I didn't know it was today.
Yeah, they called and asked if I could make it.
it's sort of a last minute thing.
I can help if you need me, Booth.
Yeah, I know. I appreciate it.
this is, you know, it's my thing, and, uh, I'll be fine.
wow, look at that mess.
the plan seemed to be to dismember the body and dispose of it down that drain pipe.
passerby saw someone in the building and called the cops.
I wish the hadn't sent rookies.
one of them ended up rolling around in the remains.
I can't tell if the remains were damaged by the police officer or the killer.
Phaenicia sericata, early stage of colonization.
death occurred about eight hours ago.
it looks like the guy melted.
based on the size and robusticity of the skull, the victim is female.
great, still melted.
well, the killer doused her in some kind of corrosive liquid.
pretty caustic stuff.
it burned the skin off of one of the rookie's hands.
residual striations between the C5 and C6 vertebrae indicate that a crosscut saw was used in dismemberment.
no saw was found.
no weapons, and this place hasn't been used in years.
Oh, slippery when wet.
Dr. Hodgins, we have to find a way to counteract whatever corrosive was used or all this tissue could be compromised.
right, uh, could be formic or acedic acid...
...in a base of sodium hydride or possibly sodium hydroxide that's...
great, okay-okay, Mr. Wizard, how do we stop it from melting everything?
well, the killer probably used common household cleaners, so water would do the trick.
I mean, I could use the pressure hose and just...
Oh, no, a pressure hose could cause the bone to fragment.
but the tissue is dissolving, so go for it.
did you hear what I said, Dr. Saroyan.
Yes, but you can always recover the fragments that were washed away, where as I will lose the tissue for all time.
but, no, I would like to discuss this before...
I'm sure you would, but that would be a waste of valuable time, and since I'm the boss...
booth? - Well, don't look at me, it's not my jurisdiction.
Dr. B, I would, um...
time to spray it down. All right.
all the cuts were made at the joints.
I hope this person was already dead when that happened.
because we neutralized the enzymatic cleaner, I'm going to be able to run a full tox screen.
Hey, man.
I hear it's your birthday.
now, you are looking good.
what are you today, 24? 25?
actually, my birthday is tomorrow. I'll be 29.
Oh, happy birthday.
it's no big deal.
what, are you kidding me? 29 is a big one.
Oh, you're just feeling like you haven't achieved enough.
what? - Because, you know,
cam, she was the Chief Coroner of New York when she was 29.
is that true?
no, no. I... I was the Deputy Chief Coroner.
well, where were you?
on my 29th birthday, I was here.
working at the Jeffersonian.
so, not much progress in your life since.
sort of stagnated at 29.
not really, I have a beautiful wife and child.
but, you lost your entire family fortune.
well, consider myself ahead on points.
in bending and stellate fractures to the frontal and temporal bones suggest a blunt force trauma.
antemortem fracturing to the iliac crest.
also you'll note that the fifth and sixth left rib present calluses indicative of recurrent trauma.
there's a fracture to the left nasal bone and three missing front teeth.
wow, giving it the old college try on the brilliance.
I admire your pluck.
taken as a whole, the antemortem injuries are consistent with domestic abuse.
Dr. Hodgins is just complimenting you on your fine work.
very good for a 29-year-old.
the serial number on this bridge will provide us with an I. D.
Mr. Bray.
happy birthday.
what?
so, the FBI field crew, they swept the slaughterhouse, you know, they couldn't find any fingerprints.
anyone who watches TV knows to wear gloves when dismembering their victim.
is this a serial killer or not?
I... I don't think so.
no, I mean, unless it was someone's first kick at the serial killer can.
there's no sense of ritual here.
there's no sense of perverse enjoyment.
it's not weird enough.
cutting someone up and stuffing her in a wheelbarrow, that's not weird enough for you?
you know what I'm talking about.
it was done hastily, without a plan.
bones said the victim had telltale signs of abuse.
years of domestic abuse come to a head, the victim dies, the, uh, abuser cuts up the body to hide his guilt.
does that work? - Yeah, that works.
all right. Wendell's got an I. D. on the victim.
it's a Melinda Perkins, 32, married to a Dr. Bradley Perkins.
you know, why don't you go talk to the doctor.
tell him that his wife was murdered and see how he reacts.
where are you going? - I got a thing.
you're usually very forthcoming about where you're going, what you're doing.
kind of in a hurry.
you know, this is the second Friday in a row that you've been evasive.
ticktock. - My theory, is that you're going to Friday confession.
no, I can't go to confession. - Why not?
Why? Because I'm living with a woman outside the bond of holy matrimony.
the only way to get absolution for your sins, is if you intend not to sin again.
but you intend to continue to live with Dr. Brennan.
you know what, Sweets, you either live by the rules in life or you don't.
Hey, you never told me where you were going.
this is everything that I was able to retrieve from the microprocessor inside the victim's watch.
did you pinpoint the time at which the watch broke?
12: 24 a. m. And it gets better.
this is one of those fancy, high-tech sports watches that reads the victim's heart rate, GPS location, and even the altitude.
notice how the victim's heart rate was elevated for close to two minutes prior to flatlining.
a person's maximum heart rate is approximately 220 minus their age.
Melinda was 32 years old and her heart rate peaked at 186.
so, maybe she was running from someone?
or her adrenal glands pumped everything they had into her system.
because she was scared? - Yes.
Hello, Booth.
no. Yes, yes, I understand.
okay. How long will you be at the hospital?
no, I-I know how important this is to you, and I will adjust my schedule accordingly.
we will be able to talk more freely later.
so, good-bye for now.
you were saying GPS?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
what was that about?
booth is going to be later than he anticipated tonight.
at the hospital?
no.
but you just said hospital.
is Booth sick? What is going on?
why are you being so mysterious?
I am not... free to discuss that with you right now, Angela.
you're not free to discuss that with me?
that is correct.
okay, that is not acceptable.
if I could tell you, I would, you know that.
please, trust me.
okay, it's just... I'm just asking because I care.
I know. I know.
Melinda's dead, that's what you're telling me.
murdered, Dr. Perkins.
these are crime scene photos.
I figure since you're an E. R. trauma surgeon, you might want to see proof.
is she recognizable?
no, sir, she was dismembered.
in that case, I'll pass.
how long have you two been separated?
a year.
after having been married... - Seven years.
mostly happy?
Melinda was, um... an exciting, difficult woman.
she had a very big personality.
so, she was the one that wanted a divorce?
Yes. She had decided that I was, stodgy.
our forensic team notes that she sustained a number of injuries after your separation.
I don't beat up ex-wives.
I start looking for viable candidates for a new wife.
okay. I think you told me everything I need to know, except, um, where were you last night when your wife was murdered?
I was at the hospital.
I got out of there about 2: 00 a. m.
can anyone corroborate that?
check with the hospital.
people know me there.
GPS on Melinda Perkins' watch places her not in the slaughterhouse at time of death, but approximately 100 meters east.
okay, so, she's either in or near the warehouse.
do you think the victim's ex-husband lured her out here?
uh, he's got an alibi.
maybe the victim was kidnapped, right?
she escaped, and she ran. Hold on, hold on. Ma'am?
ma'am, you okay? - Has someone attacked you?
I'm fine. It was... It was just an accident.
all right, wall it out! Wall it out! Wall it out!
what is that? - That is Roller Derby, Bones! Look at that.
here we go. Here we go.
name's Bennett. Nick Bennett. I own the team.
no one owns the Derby Dolls, Nickie.
we're a cooperative.
that barely breaks even.
I built the track, I manage the team, and I guess 'cause I don't have boobs, that doesn't mean anything.
and don't forget it.
I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.
Susan Carroll. But everybody here calls me Emily Kickinson.
that's like Emily Dickinson.
right. Okay, does anyone recognize this woman here?
that's Pummel-ya Anderson.
Ah. These names are amusing.
I should give names to my interns.
Peter Patella, Timothy Tibia.
her real name's Melinda Perkins.
something happen to her?
she was murdered last night, somewhere in this facility.
Oh, God. - When's the last time you saw Melinda?
last night. We had a match against The Virginia Slims.
we all went out for drinks afterwards, but Melinda said that she wasn't feeling too well.
did she get injured? - No more than usual.
she was tough. The woman took a punishment for the past year with no complaints.
that would explain the injuries that appeared to be domestic abuse.
anyone here who'd want to hurt Melinda?
no. This team's a family.
we're like sisters.
did you hear from Ivanna today?
Oh, God. Uh... - Who's Ivanna?
Ivanna Kick Ass. She didn't show up for practice today, either.
you guys got to see if she's okay.
what the hell is going on around here?
what the hell are you looking at me for?
okay, look, I'm gonna need Ivanna's home address and her cell number.
and her real name...
if it isn't Ivanna Kick Ass.
Hey, so, the particulates I swabbed from the skull injuries showed traces of polyurethane and sandarac resin.
Meaning? - Meaning, it's a wheel from a roller skate that picked up the resin from the varnish on the track.
so we have cause of death.
she was beaten with a skate.
Yeah, well...
can you match the varnish to the track the Derby Dolls use?
Yeah, piece of cake... which I wish I had now to celebrate your big day.
it's not necessary.
Hey, have you made your pre-30 bucket list yet?
I didn't know that was a thing.
Yeah. Everybody knows there are things you cannot do after 30 without being a real loser.
I doubt that. Young of heart.
that's what my grandpa used to say.
look, can we just focus on the case?
we-we have cause of death.
we just have to tie it to someone.
well, there have to be tons of skates at the rink.
your grandpa's wrong, by the way, okay?
how about dating a crazy girl?
what?
dating a girl that you know is nuts, but you just have to do it anyway, even though you know it's going to end badly.
Cheryl Cates. Major loon.
okay. All right, um, ironic facial hair.
I got one for you.
posing naked for a hot art student.
that is still a big regret of mine.
done it. Not a student, though.
Really?
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
no. - You brought it up, man.
Oh, no. No!
Oh, I cannot believe this!
angela and I used to date. You-you knew that.
let-let's just say that my bucket list is finished, okay?
end of discussion. I'm fine. 29 is great. No complaints.
Yeah, of course not, because you posed naked for my wife.
Oh, my God! Look at this. - What?
I don't know. I just said that.
can we just forget about this? Please?
it'll be my birthday present.
fine.
Oh, sometimes I hate being an adult.
Hey. Are you busy?
Yes, very.
but you're not, like, busy, busy, right?
actually very busy, busy.
I might have found toxins in the victim.
Oh. So you're almost done.
what is it, Angela?
have you heard anything? - About what?
I feel like something's wrong.
Brennan was on the phone with him, and he was at the hospital.
and she won't talk about it.
she wouldn't tell you?
I know, right? I mean, she tells me everything.
I just thought, you know, since you and Booth were close, that...
no, he hasn't said anything to me.
I mean, why the secrecy if he's okay, right?
Oh, God, I hate it when he gets all stoic. - Yeah.
but he has Dr. Brennan.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
and-and I'm sure, if they needed anything, they would ask.
no, they wouldn't.
no, they would not.
hydrocodone.
well, that makes sense. Is she was being battered at the rink, she'd need a pain medication.
and did she also need Ecstasy and marijuana and methylphenidate?
Oh, not unless she was a party animal.
looks like you got pretty banged up there from your last match.
is that why you, uh, missed practice?
I had an exam to study for?
I'm going to night school to become a physical therapist.
so, what happened to Melinda?
I was hoping you'd be able to tell me.
you two were pretty, uh, competitive.
Yeah. So? Because we're women, you don't think we can handle competition like men?
that's not what I meant.
you might think it's harder for women to bond in a team sport, but actually, we make men look pathetic.
I think you need to take a breath.
okay? Remember, this is about Melinda here. That's what's important.
sorry.
she was my friend.
the competition made each of us better on the rink.
so, if she was your friend, did she ever tell you about anyone who wanted to hurt her?
she never said anything, but... she lived a pretty wild life.
Melinda... she'd push it, you know?
I told her she could get in trouble.
Yeah, drugs. We know. - And guys.
Melinda couldn't get enough of them.
she told me she took this one guy.
I told her it was crazy, but she had sex with him on the lawn in front of her ex's house.
Hey, look, the husband says that he was at the hospital.
the nurses station have him checking out after his rounds at 2: 00 a. m.
which is after time of death.
he still has the clearest motive.
it's got to be difficult to deal with a woman who has sex with another man right in front of you.
he's got an alibi.
what about the other men she was involved with?
the groupies? There's no one has any names, and there's no security cameras to check.
the drug taking, the public sex, the putting herself in physical danger out on the rink...
that's... that is extreme behavior.
that could explain her police record, public intoxication, disturbing the peace, shoplifting.
guys, how does any of this help, okay?
she was killed at the rink, beaten with a skate, all right.
the answer is in the rink.
so we go question everyone at the rink, get a search warrant.
we'd never be able to get a warrant to go through everybody's personal effects.
They-they'd think we were fishing.
there might be another way.
this is nuts.
no one asked you to do this, Angie.
Brennan said they were at a dead end unless somebody could get inside the rink.
you are an artist, not a cop.
I know, but they need somebody to go in there to ALS skates and maybe find out where the victim was killed.
I repeat. You are an artist, not a cop!
Yeah, but I can skate.
and they need somebody to replace Melinda, so I am going to try out. It's perfect.
Yeah, it's perfect, except for the part when you get horribly disfigured by the other skaters.
I want to help, and this will get me out from behind the computer.
okay. Okay, then, we'll go bungee jumping.
Hey, you fell in love with a wild woman, didn't you?
Yes, a beautiful wild woman.
and that's how I will remain.
because nobody screws with Smackie Kennedy.
what do you think? - You look amazing.
Thanks, babe.
ladies, welcome to tryouts.
due to an unforeseeable event, Derby Dolls have a slot that needs to be filled.
good luck to you all.
let's do it. Go, girl. Do it!
good luck, girl!
she's a sneaky one!
give her the elbow!
what?
Oh, you gonna cry about it?
Oh, come on!
come on, get up!
come on, girl!
Ooh. Blood tie-die.
not exactly peace and love, is it?
speaking of blood, how did Angela do?
Oh, man, I-I... I haven't heard anything, so I'm assuming that no news is good news.
the spatter on the chest and the right shoulder?
these here that look like comets?
Yeah, the length and directionality suggest a cast-off spray.
you think she was hacked at before she died?
our victim wasn't just beaten to death; she was stabbed.
still here?
everyone's gone.
Hey, you okay?
I know you can see me.
your eyes are open.
corpses have their eyes open.
you should shower.
the heat will be good on any of your strained muscles.
thank you, but I'm just going to stay right here and die of internal bleeding.
you did good out there.
Thanks.
you think good enough to be on the team?
it's not just my decision, but, yeah, I'm guessing you're at the top of the list.
Thanks.
Oh, great.
they all have blood.
Hey, Emily.
what's up with the eyewear?
Oh, these are my shooting glasses 'cause I enjoy all types of violence.
don't leave your valuables up in here.
things tend to go missing.
Ivanna had a vintage cigarette lighter that went missing.
I had a bracelet that got snatched.
wait, you mean you have a petty thief on the team?
I wish stealing from the lockers was the only thing we had to worry about around here.
I only mention this 'cause I'm pretty sure you're going to be on the team.
Oh, that's great.
Hey, do you want to get a drink after this to celebrate?
it'll be my treat.
you paying, I'm down.
all right.
hurry up, I'll wait outside.
okay.
booth heard from Angela. - Is she all right?
she says she feels like she's been in a rock fight, but she's fine.
she also said there was blood on all the skates.
Oh, that makes sense.
no hair or tissue either.
so the rock fight was for nothing.
Mr. Bray says the remains are fully cleaned.
good, I'll take a look.
Dr. Brennan, I am going to ask you a personal question, which I don't normally do, as you know.
is something wrong with Seeley?
nothing is wrong with Booth.
I know he was in the hospital.
nothing is wrong with Booth.
I'm not allowed to talk about it.
those two statements contradict each other.
and I know this is none of my business.
it is none of your business.
everything's fine.
that's all Booth will let me say about it.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go look at Mr. Bray's bare bones.
Dr. Brennan, I've begun profiling the dismemberment tool the killer used.
well, typically handsaws are one of two designs based on function: rip or crosscut.
this false start kerf on the left distal ulna... it's a perfect 70-degree angle.
well, a ripsaw would be 90 degrees.
take a look at the cross section of the left femur.
the narrow lines on the residual striae indicate very fine teeth.
I estimate a 12-point count based on the breakaway spurs.
also deep gullets to allow for such a smooth cut.
what's your conclusion?
wood saw... high quality.
Nick Bennett, the manager of the Derby Dolls, said that he built the wooden track himself.
Dr. Saroyan said that the blood spatter evidence indicated that there might be a corresponding laceration to the right acromion.
sure enough, there is a shallow, serrated abrasion.
hemorrhagic staining indicates that this cut was made perimortem.
this is good work.
so, I'm doing my pretty girl skating, right?
all fluffy dress and, and, and, and twirls.
Oh, twirls, I love twirls.
and I see this boy that I like...
he is getting smacked into the boards over and over by his friends.
smacked into the boards.
I took 'em out. Bang!
took 'em out. Bang!
I saved that boy. - And you know what?
he did not like that because he was a boy.
that's correct.
all right, but I liked it a lot.
so, here I am, doing Roller Derby.
roller Derby is fun.
what's your excuse?
I'm here.
you sure are.
Yay.
okay, this is my boyfriend.
and we, uh, we sleep together and everything, don't we, honey?
uh, right, yeah.
we do.
no, no. He's a cop.
Oh, I know, I know.
um, I actually found out that you were down a girl on your team because of him.
that's why I tried out.
he's a... a very good-looking cop.
he sure is.
can you just give us a weensy minute over here?
weensy.
Weensy, weensy.
let's go, honey.
are you just pretending to be drunk here or what?
um, well... Oh, no.
okay, hey.
okay.
uh, I am pretty drunk, but I didn't call you for a ride home.
really bad with the whole undercover thing, you really are.
Really? - Yeah.
because guess who found out that Nick has been ripping off the team by skimming from the till, and guess who accused him to his face?
Melinda Perkins? - That's right, so now you have to arrest him.
wait a second, I don't have any grounds to arrest him.
Yeah, but I tricked him into coming here so you could arrest him.
Angela, I need something here.
I can't just arrest someone for...
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, he's here, go get him.
you got to go get him, Booth. - Relax, you're a little loud.
looks like I got here a little too late.
right. Remember me? FBI.
Hey, do you think maybe we can kiss, like, one more time?
you've had your fun. I got to ask you a few questions, all right?
it was fun. - Get some coffee for her over here.
I figured I'd ask.
why would I kill Melinda?
she was one of our best players.
fans came just to see her.
right, yeah, I mean, the receipts... they show that you were selling out.
I thought you said there was no money in Roller Derby.
there isn't... you should see my expenses.
what percentage of the gate do you give to the girls?
that's more than most managers; you can check it out.
Oh, I'll check it out, I will.
your fans... they pay cash, right?
makes it pretty easy for you to skim off the top.
look, I'm not denying money went missing from the cash box, but it wasn't me.
truthfully I thought it was Melinda.
okay, accuse the victim.
that's really classy of you, Nick.
see, that's why I didn't say anything at first. I knew what you'd think.
but you didn't confront her?
I was going to.
so the answer's no.
it's complicated, all right?
she was... we were... She was sort of wild and...
you were sleeping with her.
I'm not the most attractive guy in case you haven't noticed.
time with someone like her...
you don't want to jeopardize that by accusing her of stealing.
you knew she was seeing other guys, right?
I'm not an idiot.
I just wanted to enjoy it while I could.
did she mention her ex-husband?
she wanted to go to his place so he could see us.
I didn't go that far.
so you never met him?
I saw him a couple nights ago.
Melinda and I were at a bar.
he came in, wanted to talk.
she starts kissing me to piss him off.
he tried to keep his cool, she tossed a drink at him, he left.
I called it off after that.
and she shows up dead.
and she shows up dead.
here you go. And I'm going to see you in a little bit, right? Okay, thanks.
excuse me, uh, Dr. Crawford?
Yes.
I'm Dr. Camille Saroyan.
I work at the Medico-Legal Lab...- At the Jeffersonian.
I've heard a lot about you.
from Seeley?
um, no, from the news about your work.
you're a very impressive woman.
Oh, well, thank you, but I'm actually here about Seeley.
I was told that he's been seeing you.
and I told him this would happen, but I'm sorry, I promised I wouldn't discuss it with anyone.
we're old friends.
I know he can be a little stoic and way too private.
I promised him I would keep all his dealings here confidential, Dr. Saroyan.
it's not what I would recommend, but I have to respect his wishes.
then, a few other questions not about Seeley?
of course. Please sit down.
your specialty?
Neurofibromatosis... NF.
that's a genetic condition that can cause tumors to grow anywhere there are nerves in the body.
I'm surprised you know about it, yes, and it affects one in every 3, 000 children born.
I had no idea it was that common.
nf is more common than muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and Huntington's disease combined, and the difficulty is that each case of it is so unique.
I'm treating one child with multiple tumors in his brain, and another little girl has an optic glioma which is causing her blindness.
can you tell me... is it Christine?
is his daughter ill?
you have to talk to Seeley.
I told him no one would understand his secrecy, and I hope you understand it wouldn't be my choice.
of course. Thank you.
you can thank me by spreading the word about NF, perhaps even making a donation to the Children's Tumor Foundation.
they do really great work.
I will, and thank you again.
I'm sorry I couldn't help.
Oh, I understand.
take care. - Thanks.
Hey, did you find anything yet?
Yeah, finally. It's about time, right?
is this about your birthday again?
no, I-I've just been frustrated.
I mean, we have cause of death but not enough evidence to arrest anyone.
isn't that enough?
Yeah, sure, I just thought...
look, you're clearly dying to know what's been bothering me, so, fine.
my brother bet me that, by the time I hit 29, I'd still be a loser.
you're not a loser, Wendell.
I know, I mean, I'm working with the best people in their fields, and they want me to work with them.
Yeah. We do.
so then he's wrong.
I'm living the dream.
then he should be happy for you.
Yeah, but... he's jealous.
H-he's always wanted me to fail, so he wouldn't be the loser.
how much does he owe you?
200 bucks. But I-I can't ask him for it.
I mean, he works as a night watchman and he barely scrapes by.
so after... years of working to prove him wrong, I can't get no satisfaction.
you found something, Mr. Bray?
Yes. I did. - Yes, he did.
because he is 29 years old, and he is at the top of his game.
I'll let you two work.
happy birthday, my friend.
I should explain. - If it's not about the case, I'm not interested.
right. Look at the sternum.
I found faint postmortem microfractures.
they're consistent with someone receiving CPR after death.
so the killer attempted to resuscitate the victim after the initial attack.
that's what I thought.
but look at these postmortem cuts to both femurs.
they're in line with the femoral arteries.
so the killer didn't show remorse.
he cut the femoral arteries and then gave chest compressions in order to drain the victim's blood.
Yeah, to make sure there would be no arterial spray during dismemberment...
this would have to be someone with a knowledge of anatomy.
the victim's husband is a surgeon.
good work, Mr. Bray.
happy birthday.
Where's Dr. Sweets? I thought I was meeting with him again.
Nope. You got me this time, pal.
uh, is there a problem?
Yeah. There's a problem: your whereabouts on the night that your wife was murdered.
I talked to your night nurse.
she said that you were M. I.A. between the hours of 9: 00 and 1: 00 a. m.
Oh. I wasn't M. I.A.
I'd just come off a 12-hour shift.
I was... I was taking a nap. Every doctor...
I would never hurt Melinda. I loved her.
I'm sure you did, and it's got to be a tough pill to swallow when she doesn't love you back.
we were working through it.
Oh, right. Her throwing a drink on you in public?
or... this was my favorite one of all...
her having sex with other guys on your front lawn?
that's working through it?
Melinda had problems. I was... I was trying to help her.
right, but sometimes it's... it doesn't work out, right?
things happen, you snap.
no. - The way she was cut, the way she bled...that was definitely the work of a doctor.
a doctor who has no alibi.
I did not kill Melinda.
not on purpose. But maybe... by accident?
fueled with rage?
if you don't confess, I'm not gonna be able to help you.
I can't confess! I... Look, you don't understand.
I want a lawyer.
Hey, what'd you find?
I found that you should ask for that money from your brother.
the Mass Spectrometer told you to butt into my family business?
no. It's been on my mind, and you definitely need to collect that 200 bucks.
Why? - Because you've earned it.
now, I also found this on the victim's shirt. - More blood?
well, I treated the shirt with fluorescein.
whoa, it's flaring orange like the blood, but whatever is doing it is invisible to the naked eye.
I'll give you a hint: 80% albumin, the main constituent found in plasma.
Oh, okay. Also sodium chloride.
vitreous humor.
eyeball fluid.
so she was stabbed in the eye?
Yes. - And...then chopped up into bits.
okay, yeah, so what happened to her was awful, but I think the takeaway here is my excellent forensic work.
it's not like he's rich. M-My brother.
well, does he have more money than you?
Yeah.
he probably doesn't even remember the bet.
Yeah, but you did. The reason why you did is that he challenged your abilities, so... you proved him wrong.
that money is yours.
are you right about this?
Yes. Both about the eye stabbing and your brother.
okay. I'll get the skull so you can take a swab, see if there are any remnants of the weapon used inside the orbital socket.
already did it. Nickel, copper and lint.
I-I have no idea.
it's a key.
she was stabbed in the eye with a key.
Oh, no, I really thought it was gonna be the husband.
how do you know it isn't? - Doesn't have any keys.
his house has got a touchpad, right?
and both of his cars are keyless.
and that-that keys in the knuckle thing?
that is something they teach women as a self-defense technique.
right. - You put the keys between the knuckles and then strike.
all right, easy. Okay, thank you, ladies, for coming down.
I really appreciate it. I know we all want to find justice for Melinda Perkins.
so if you can all do me a favor and pass down your keys...
your house keys, your car keys, your locker keys.
this is crap.
come on, girls. Let's give him what he wants.
unless one of you here killed Melinda.
great. Let's pass 'em down. Thank you.
great. Thanks. Just place 'em on the bench here.
anything?
this key is approximately the right size.
and whose keys are those? - Uh, mine.
negative. - Negative.
that proves it wasn't me, right?
this is the only key that could've done it.
Where's your car?
what? - It... It's not a car.
it's the team bus.
team bus? Let's all go to the team bus.
booth? Positive.
positive. You stabbed Melinda in the eye with that key.
Ivanna. - What?!
as a physical therapist, you knew how to cut her body most effectively.
you caught her stealing, didn't you?
anyone notice that nothing's gone missing from our lockers since Melinda died?
and that all of a sudden our cut of the take is bigger?
all right. You're under arrest.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
okay, let's go, derby girl.
Hey, 29 and a great year to follow.
Cheers. - Thank you. Cheers.
Mm. You're not drinking, Angela? It's on me.
no, no. I'm-I'm taking a little breather, but happy birthday.
and we should be paying for this.
no, no, no, no, no. You guys are broke now.
it's on me.
I... came into a small windfall.
good.
and I have a little something for you.
I shouldn't be holding onto this.
what is this?
Oh, man. Wendell, this is not necessary.
it's okay. It's okay.
it's fine.
what did you do?
Hey, the Pope covered up the cherubs at the Sistine Chapel and that was Michelangelo.
Thanks, man. - You ruined that.
that was really beautiful.
I'm sure that it was.
Hey, happy birthday.
thank you.
booth is a Catholic.
in most ways, he is quite religious.
okay... Why are we spying on children at a carnival?
sick children.
booth did all of that.
I don't understand.
I think maybe it's because Parker is in England or maybe because Christine is so healthy, but...
booth wanted to give these children a carnival.
why wouldn't he want us to know he's a great guy?
first Corinthians 13: 4.
which is?
charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity brags not itself, it is not puffed up.
booth takes that to mean that real charity is anonymous.
he didn't... even want me to know.
that little boy has an illness called neurofibromatosis.
it's a... - I know what it is. I was worried.
I... I thought maybe Christine... - No. But she could.
it could happen to anyone.
nf has no treatment.
there's no cure. Not yet.
but Booth does what he can.
please don't tell Booth that I showed you.
I just... I figured you're the type of person who would keep asking questions until you found out the truth.
so now you can stop.
Booth's a good man.
booth is a very good man.
I'm telling you, this company is poised to make a killing at only $13 a share.
I don't care if it's 13 cents a share, I'm not buying, Danny.
I'm out of the game.
I've tasted freedom, man.
the city's poison. The only green I care about now is the kale I'm growing.
laugh it up, Danny.
you laugh it up from your smog-filled city office.
I'm in God's country, I'm doing God's work.
and he's looking out for me.
I bet he is.
just visit, dude. That's all I'm saying.
I will, I promise. I love kale.
Hey, what's wrong? Too much fresh air?
Oh, God, I don't know.
just smells like a dead animal, that's all.
what the hell is that?
Oh, God. Oh, God!
how do you stop this thing?
what? What? What's going on?
I just killed a dead guy!
okay, just think of it as an investment for our future.
for Parker, for Christine.
asteroid mining? - Yeah, asteroid mining.
I did my research, okay?
the head of the Jet Propulsion Lab says it's possible, and the two guys who sent the rover to Mars, they agree.
the microgravity technologies required to do so don't even exist, Booth.
you know what? There was a time when radios and-and railroads, they didn't exist, but people, they got rich.
why are you looking at me like that?
like a schoolteacher. Every time I have a good idea...
anyway, just look at the bones.
why did the farmer run over the remains?
he was an investment banker trying to get back to nature.
I'm guessing the tractor didn't handle like his Beemer.
well, according to the shallow grave here, shish kebob, he was definitely murdered.
the presence of Nicrophorus americanus, along with some of its larvae, suggest the murder took place five days ago.
right. You believe in asteroid mining?
are you kidding me? It's the only way that the species is gonna survive.
did you hear that? I am a visionary.
you're gonna be an asteroid miner?
Yeah.
I didn't ask that. Don't want to know.
please explain the difficulty to him of retrieving a 500-ton asteroid.
no. Not my place.
no, no, no. No, you just put it in a lunar orbit and send some guys up there.
I think it's really simple, actually.
is she looking at me like an angry schoolteacher?
Oh, yeah, yeah. She does that a lot. - We're here to work.
these bones have been heavily scavenged.
the three-cornered puncture marks indicate coyotes.
Oh, do you think they ran off with the head?
we've got techs searching the area for it.
flattened anterior and posterior sides of the victim's femoral neck indicate a Hispanic male.
well, it's tough to get an I. D. without the head.
easier than capturing an asteroid.
Hey. I am on your side, man.
I need all of the remains and the aerator brought back to the lab.
right.
look, they just need $2. 6 billion in seed money.
I mean, that's like a sports team almost when you think about it.
Plus, the platinum alone, it's worth about $50 billion.
why do you care what I think?
Why? Because my platinum is your platinum, and your platinum is my platinum.
$2, 500 is a lot for you, and there are no guarantees.
well, there never are. I mean, look at us.
huh? No one ever thought that we would pay off.
bringing back that much platinum could cause the bottom to drop out of the platinum market.
I'm sorry, are you trying to be supportive?
I thought I was.
I was discussing this as if it's reasonable.
Dr. Brennan!
yes?
I've got a surprise for you. Wait till you see this.
FBI. Get your hand out of the bag, get on the ground now.
now. Now! - Okay, okay, okay.
take it easy. No problems.
smith & Wesson 1911, right? A man of tradition, I see. That's a very cool gun.
it's gonna be the last thing you see if you don't shut your mouth.
booth, what are you doing? - What do you mean what am I doing?
he's all bloody. Do you really think he's got a bouquet of flowers in that bag?
he's right. I-I don't have a bouquet of flowers...
shut up. Put your head on the ground. Slide the bag very easily across the floor.
don't do anything stupid.
here.
it's your victim's skull.
Hi, I'm your new intern.
why wasn't I notified about the new intern?
have you read all your e-mails, Dr. Brennan?
well, only the ones with a subject line pertaining to a specific case.
well, I suggest you read the ones with the subject line "Personnel.
is there a problem with Dr. Wells?
he brought a skull into the diner in a satchel.
he's enthusiastic.
he tracked the skull to a coyote den six miles from the crime scene.
well, that is enthusiastic, but... - He hasn't learned our protocols yet.
I think you'll find him a quick study though.
based on what?
Dr. Wells has a PhD in physics, a masters in both astronomy and wildlife ecology, and he's two credits short of a masters in forensic anthropology.
well, how was I supposed to know that?
well, perhaps you should read the e-mails with the subject line "Intern Résumés.
he's also passed the bar.
it's like getting five interns for the price of one.
except that he brought me the skull in a bag made of recycled plastic, which produces condensation, which could have severely compromised crucial evidence.
which is why I rushed the skull to you at the diner, Dr. Brennan.
you see, condensation starts after three hours.
I got you the skull in an hour and 45 minutes.
that's simple physics.
and the plastic was recycled so... good for the environment.
can we please de-spike this dude so I can start picking through his clothing?
all in good time, Dr. Hodgins.
what should I do now?
tell Dr. Brennan what you've deduced so far.
induced, actually. Going from the specific to the general, lack of cut marks on the gonial angle of the mandible, underside of chin and cervical vertebrae leave me no reason to suspect that this skull was removed by anything other than the coyotes.
so... not a zombie?
zombies have to be beheaded or they eat your brains.
there are no such things as zombies or vampires or ghosts.
the first law of thermodynamics states that energy is neither created nor destroyed.
so when we die, all that energy has to go somewhere, right?
I believe that if we die with an abundance of this power, it can become forever imprinted on the immediate environment.
and that imprint, that's our ghost?
can we keep him? - I haven't decided yet.
there appears to be a strange glow emanating from the victim's inferior nasal conchae.
Ooh, ghosty.
the guy literally fought off coyotes to get the skull back.
Yeah. That's awesome.
coyotes, they just run away if you yell at them.
I know, but still, to face a pack of wild animals alone...
I'm sure you'd just bore them to death with your shrinky talk.
a-and I'm sure you could just break their hearts with your mean, mean words.
Wow. - Yeah, wow.
so, the brother is the victim's only family that you found?
so far. Okay, Hodgins found traces of glow-in-the-dark au paint in the victim's nose.
it's rare stuff apparently, and he traced it back to the brother's auto body shop.
you know, driving a glow-in-the-dark car seems like an excellent safety feature, doesn't it?
don't say stuff like that when we get there, okay?
look, the guy's brother is dead.
I know. I'm just... telling you.
and... I'm not wrong.
Oh, God. Yes.
that's my little brother Benji.
he's dead?
Yes, sir.
we're sorry for your loss.
who did this? - Well, we're not sure yet.
he worked here, right? - Yeah.
why didn't you report him missing? - Benji was in college.
finals coming up, I gave him a week off to hole up and study.
first one ever in our family to go to college.
is there any other family we should notify, Mr. Garcia?
no.
it's just me and Benji. Mom died four years ago, Dad took off when we were little kids.
what happened to my brother?
well, his remains are still being examined.
Oh, God. That's bad.
you find his truck?
why would the truck be the first thing you bring up?
if somebody killed Benji, it had to be for his truck.
tricked-out '59 El Camino.
you think someone would kill for a pickup truck?
I'll tell you who hated that truck. - Courtney.
who's Courtney?
his ex-girlfriend.
they broke up a week ago.
okay, given the choice, would you rather have your brain in a beetle's body or a beetle's brain in your body?
okay, all right, I'll bite.
if my brain were in a beetle's body, then I would be King of the Beetles, just like I'm King of the Lab.
there, what does that answer tell you?
it tells me you not only feel like you belong here, but that this is your domain and you love it. You're a very happy man.
Ah, I can't argue with any of that.
contusion on the occipital bone, roughly 20 millimeters in diameter.
staining suggests that the trauma occurred around the time of death.
Dr. Brennan prefers we use terms like "conked on the noggin.
the beetle question also told me that you're mischievous and disruptive by spirit and willing to lie for humorous effect.
that conk wasn't enough to kill.
what else did that beetle question tell you?
you got picked on a lot in high school, didn't you?
I didn't kill Benji.
uh, that man was the love of my life.
so it was Benji who broke up with you?
Seriously?
look at me.
I am the one who dumped him.
I thought you said he was the love of your life.
Yeah. Too bad it wasn't a reciprocal relationship.
Oh, right. So there was another woman.
again, please, look at me.
you really think that Benji could get a woman hotter than me?
I mean... I couldn't compete with his truck though.
ever since he saw that old photo of his dad posing with an El Camino, he decided that he needed to restore one just like it.
so, what did he do the rest of the time?
his experiments, which I did not resent.
Why?
they were scientific experiments.
Benji was... wicked smart.
except when it came to the stupid truck.
I know some scientists, and they are specific about their branch of science.
time travel.
what? - Benji was into... time travel?
not time-share, like condos, but traveling... through time?
Yeah. He wanted to be the first to do it.
okay, so... Benji wanted to be a time traveler, but you were mad at him because of a truck?
one was gonna make us a lot of money, the other was just a stupid truck.
and when was the last time you talked to Benji?
last Saturday night. We argued.
about the truck?
Courtney, that was the night that he was killed.
did he say anything that could lead to his killer?
he said he was too busy.
with his truck. - Of course.
his truck.
would you choose a truck over this?
okay, seriously, but is she crazy enough to kill someone?
she seems to display some of the symptoms of Intermittent Explosive Disorder.
what does that mean, she gets mad?
I. E.D. is usually characterized by sporadic episodes of extreme aggression, violence and destructive behavior.
sweets, could she kill him?
if she was at the mercy of her own anger, yeah.
what are you eating, Dr. Wells?
string cheese.
do you want some string cheese?
eating in the lab is strictly prohibited.
whenever I'm working on a conundrum, I always eat string cheese.
it started when I was in grade school and I was getting ready for the science fair.
which I won. - I don't care.
thought-controlled prosthetic limbs and the elimination of artifact distraction from E. E.G. signal processing.
I'm pretty sure you care about that.
I was 13 years old.
we are concerned with these bones, now.
nothing more. - Right.
the, uh, cheese made me think of calcium, which is important for bone growth, and that brought my attention to the scoliosis from which the victim suffered.
I also found incomplete perimortem fractures to the right anterolateral tibia and fibula.
you got to admit, I'm pretty impressive.
until recently on the isle of Vanuatu, you could be cannibalized for disobeying your tribal chief.
and you could have been forced to give your child to my clan to settle this petty conflict.
you're familiar with the Vanuatu?
my knowledge is vast. Which is why I'm here, right?
so, don't try to cherry-pick facts to win an argument.
then let's deal with our tribe.
you have not yet found cause of death.
finish rearticulating these bones as ordered or you will be banished.
double mocha latte.
Oh, God's perfect food.
I thought that was pizza.
well, you need something to wash it down with.
did you find anything in Benji's clothes?
well, a couple of strawberry seeds in his shoe tread.
were there any strawberries on the farm where he was buried?
no, but they are grown pretty much everywhere else.
so it doesn't help much in determining what he was doing on the night of his death.
well, how about you?
well, Courtney's alibi checked out.
she was hating on a DJ at a club.
so, I looked into Benji's hard drive.
it's filled with headache-inducing theories on time travel.
awesome.
time dilation.
relativistic velocities.
this kid was pretty smart.
he was trying to go back, not forward.
what difference does that make?
I mean, this is all crazy.
not really. See, Einstein tells us that traveling into the future is theoretically possible, but visiting the past, now that gets into causality and everything starts falling apart.
do you think he really thought that he could do it?
Oh, man, wouldn't you want to?
I would go back to April 19, 2004.
the moment I first met you.
you had a rubber band on your wrist, and a spider on your shoulder.
that's right. What about you?
if you could go back, what moment would you choose?
I would choose that one.
I would choose that... I would choose that same moment.
you had to take a minute to think about that.
are you sure?
Yes, I am... I'm sure.
give me this.
one other thing that I found.
Benji was spending a lot of time on the Collindale University server.
which is very weird, because he wasn't a student there.
he was logged in as Professor Scott Hunter.
hunter. He's a theoretical physicist.
you know, a lot of Benji's math was pretty sophisticated.
I wonder if they were working together on that.
on time travel?
Yeah, theoretical physicists can be pretty weird.
I'll tell Booth to look into Hunter.
you sure you didn't want to go back to some other time?
Nope.
that time.
Yeah, okay.
people become obsessed with time travel either because they're missing something or they're running away from something.
well, according to his brother, Benji had a pretty rough childhood.
I mean, come on, why would anyone want to revisit that?
because that's where he felt that he lost a part of himself.
I think he wanted to go back to stop his dad from leaving.
what, he was trying to save his family from falling apart?
Yes. Exactly.
look, everyone at some point has wanted to go back.
I... I wish I could, to see the Finleys again.
the couple that adopted me.
they saved my life, and I was... a kid, I... I gave them a rough time, I don't know.
I just wish I could go back and let them know how much I appreciate them.
they know.
um, you said you found something?
Yeah.
this guy, uh, Professor Hunter, might be someone else who's looking for a do-over.
taught physics at Collindale till two years ago, when he was fired for electrocuting a student.
he was also supposed to meet Benji the night he was killed.
Dr. Brennan, given the choice, would you rather be run over by one steamroller or by 1, 000 mopeds?
why would you ask such a preposterous question?
Dr. George did psychological experiments at Cambridge on bias and judgment formation...
I don't like psychology.
and I'm not the one we're studying here.
sorry.
would that be one moped 1, 000 times, or 1, 000 mopeds at once?
it doesn't matter.
you'd choose the steamroller.
by the time it had run over your legs, you'd already be dead from shock.
it fits in with your hyper-rational outlook.
please don't pretend to know how my mind works.
you shy away from randomness, and that prevents you from casting a wide net.
are you saying that I'm narrow-minded?
your words, not mine.
that's interesting. There appears to be microfracturing to the anterior and posterior aspects of right sternal ribs nine and ten.
as well as the anterior aspect of the right vertebral ribs 11 and 12.
so whatever created this damage also created some pretty horrific damage to the liver as well.
which would have certainly caused his death.
didn't Agent Booth say that the professor that Benji was working with once electrocuted a student?
if a current passed through the thoracic region with enough voltage, it could certainly have created the fracturing on the bone.
no wide net needed.
professor Hunter got fired for electrocuting a student.
losing university resources could drive Hunter to start working with outsiders such as Benji.
experiment that goes wrong, Benji gets electrocuted.
and knowing that he could be convicted of negligent homicide,
hunter decides to, what, dump the body.
you're casting a wide net.
by positing various motives.
I don't do that, apparently.
rather be run over by a steamroller.
what?
you want to be run over by a steamroller?
Yes.
instead of a thousand mopeds, of course.
I'm-I'm... what am I hearing right now?
am I having a stroke?
Dr. Wells defined me, with ease.
I don't like that.
even if he's correct.
I'd love to help you here, Bones, but I really have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
it's fine, Booth.
maybe Dr. Wells is right.
maybe I'm narrow-minded.
Wow!
no. No. What?
odd for a professor of theoretical physics to be working with someone without a degree.
benjamin read an article I had written.
he knew I was conducting experiments in time travel and wanted to help.
so, what, he just show up at your doorstep one day?
basically, yes.
it was about a year ago.
we've been working together ever since.
including the night that he died.
we've pinpointed time of death.
you think I killed Benjamin?
well, I mean, accidents do happen, but you know that all too well, now, don't you, Professor?
this is ludicrous. You can't be serious.
sometimes these accidents are just so big, you just try to cover them up, isn't that right?
we need to see your lab, Professor.
at-at least put on a gown.
you're contaminating the entire facility.
please, Dr. Brennan, from one scientist to another.
that's for my metamaterial experiment.
please don't touch that.
exposed wiring.
you seem to make a habit out of being negligent, Professor.
this is a 240-volt battery.
if Benji came into contact with these wires, it could have created the fracturing we found on his ribs.
professor was cooking with some serious fire with these batteries.
240 volts to the chest could definitely be responsible for Benji's death, but was it enough to crack his ribs?
well, that's what we're here to find out, my brother from another mother.
see, this ordnance gel has been calibrated to absolutely replicate human tissue, so we can see if the ribs crack when they're electrocuted.
you certainly love your job, huh?
see, I always get bored so easily, which is why keep accumulating all these degrees.
which explains your hope that time travel exists, because that would not be boring.
Yeah, well, I would not go back, though.
I'd keep my past in the past.
whoa, it's like you're hiding something.
no, it's just, what's done is done.
there's so much more money to be made in the future.
I wouldn't go that far forward.
just, like, five years.
vernor Vinge's theory of exponential accelerating change, huh?
exactly, and that pretty much guarantees some pretty sweet technological advances.
so, you would travel to the future, steal their technology, then bring it back here to the present and make a fortune?
well, there's no legal precedent for time travel, so I wouldn't exactly say I was stealing.
well, being that we are evidence-based here,
I think you should keep that one to yourself.
okay. Ready?
Yeah.
zip up.
put this on.
thank you.
okay.
ready?
fire in the hole!
technically, it's not a fire until the amps make sure the...
maybe, uh, next time, protective eyewear, I think?
maybe? - Fair enough.
Wow. We just hit this guy with enough current to take down an elephant.
still no fracturing of the ribs.
meaning that Benji was not killed by electrocution.
thought. Have you considered hydrostatic shock?
you're talking about doing another experiment, aren't you?
perhaps I am your brother from another mother.
so, the professor said that there was a call made to Benji's cell phone on Saturday night, and there was, but the caller used a disposable cell.
Benji was at the professor's place in Silver Spring when he got the call.
the FBI said the victim borrowed cash from Professor Hunter, and withdrew cash from two ATMs.
one here, and the second here, farther outside the city.
so, Benji was leaving town, and collecting money as he went.
the body was found here in Brookmont.
so, why was Benji at an ATM up in North Bethesda?
cam, if time travel existed, and you could make one trip, what would it be?
you mean, like, have tea with Jesus, or strangle Hitler in his crib?
or redo something from your own life when you were happiest.
what is it?
I can't.
Oh, come on!
do you remember your ex-husband?
Oh, my God! Birimbau?
I am sorry.
I would do the same thing.
the same guy, I mean. Oh, my God.
would you tell your significant other the truth, or would you...?
Oh, I would tell him that... I wanted to have tea with Jesus.
excuse me?
I ran a spectroscopic analysis of the strawberry seeds and soil found in the sole of Benji's shoe. Could you...?
Yes, yes.
now, the shoe soil is very deficient in calcium.
but his body was found in soil extremely rich in calcium.
so, the body was moved after he was killed?
Yeah, he was killed in serpentine soil.
it's very rare, but there are some deposits here in Rockville.
that is a strawberry farm near Rockville.
tell Booth. - Cam, I actually came in here to ask you for a gun.
okay.
I wanted to shoot the gun.
well, I am the one authorized to shoot the gun.
my only question is, why?
the microfracturing on the victim's ribs did not occur due to electrical shock, but the waves in the gel made me think of hydrostatic shock.
see, the high rate of speed at which a bullet enters the body causes displacement in the liquids surrounding it.
so we believe that if the victim was shot just below the rib cage, this expansion could have created the microfracturing.
okay.
fire in the hole!
that's my...
that's my line.
it worked.
the victim was shot.
Wow. It is good to have a physicist in the house.
what?
I... It's...
the house is completely boarded up.
doesn't look like anyone's lived here for quite some time.
Really? Then why is there a light on in the barn?
all right, enough. Can you keep that down?
Oh, easy. Easy, easy.
Yeah. Looks like someone broke in.
well, looks like Benji's truck.
I think it's more of a car, to be honest with you.
that's a lot of blood for one person.
Benji may have also been killed here.
rugged nuchal area on the cranium, as well as the convoluted sutures, suggest the victim was an Hispanic male.
like Benji.
victim appears to have suffered projectile trauma to the inferior right thoracic region.
like Benji.
texturing of the sternal rib ends indicates an age of mid-to-late 40s.
bones, I mean, you're describing Benji, but 20 years older.
the victim suffered a single gunshot wound to the inferior right thoracic region.
and judging by the marbling and skin slippage, I'd say he's been dead about six days?
double huh.
I'm sorry. Why the double huh, Dr. Wells?
because I believe that our two victims may be the same person.
excuse me? - Quantum physics tells us that out there somewhere is a world 20 years ahead of this one, right?
theoretically.
now, assuming that Benji is a time traveler from the future...
big assumption. - Big assumption.
when he transports himself back here, he changes the course of his destiny in this time.
so, when younger Benji gets shot, future Benji must then take a bullet to satisfy the variable of causality.
is this necessary?
you said that you believe time travel is impossible.
just because something is theoretically impossible doesn't mean that it's not possible.
I believe that is exactly what it means.
well, of course you do, because your mind stops working when it hears the word impossible, where mine just keeps going and exploring.
if you believe that the two victims are the same person, you don't belong in this lab.
of course I don't believe that. That's absurd.
excellent. Moving on.
but I do embrace the impossible probability as a reality.
I mean, what serious scientist wouldn't?
I found a contusion on the frontal bone, roughly 20 millimeters in diameter.
which suggests this man was struck on the head around time of death.
just like... our first victim.
I believe that warrants a triple huh.
this guy... he is a jackass.
okay? He's gonna be gone when this case is over.
maybe Dr. Wells has a point, though.
just because we can't travel through time right now doesn't mean that we can't do it in the future.
okay, well, then, why aren't these future-seeing people here, and they're not rewriting the past, or betting on football games then?
okay, I don't have all the answers.
I'm just trying to cast a wider net.
okay, well, here's where I'm casting mine.
so, these guys... they met at a remote place.
there were burner cells that were involved.
there was cash that we never found.
suggesting an illegal transaction that ends in death.
but the only thing I don't understand is, why the killer took Benji's body and buried it in another farm.
well, clearly, we need a wider net.
this guy Wells... did he mention anything about the asteroid mining?
what? - Booth.
I'm just curious. - Really?
Yeah.
sorry to interrupt your lunch, but I found something on the second victim's right patella.
Oh, a comminuted fracture.
right. I placed the bone under a microscope, and at 40 times magnification, I found evidence of slight remodeling.
so, he was probably walking or limping on this injury for several few days.
that is a severe break.
the man must have been in immense pain.
right. Yet, instead of going to a hospital, he was hanging out in a barn?
see, I'm thinking, he didn't go to the hospital because he couldn't.
he couldn't jeopardize anybody knowing that he was from the future.
or perhaps there is a more logical explanation.
the victim suffered from a minor case of scoliosis.
just like Benji.
right. And Scoliosis is a hereditary disease, which suggests that both victims might be related.
sorry to disappoint you, Dr. Wells.
DNA results confirm that our second victim is Benji's father.
sounds reasonable.
first you tell me my little brother's dead.
now you're telling me my father's dead, too?
I'm sorry for your loss.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I can't believe this.
you told Agent Booth that your father left when you and Benji were young.
were you aware that, um, Benji's been in contact with your dad?
no. Benji would have told me.
it must have been a one-time thing.
how can you be so sure of that?
cause Benji thought our dad was dead.
why would he think that?
Benji was little when Felix left.
rather than tell him his dad was a deadbeat junkie, Mom and I decided to tell him that Felix was dead.
when was the last time you saw your father?
years ago.
and that was fine with me.
now, if your father was still an addict, do you think that could explain why he reached out to Benji last Saturday night?
had to be.
that son of a bitch was probably in trouble with one of his dealers.
he needed Benji to bail him out.
the bullet that entered Felix nicked the sternal end of the inferior tenth, and then, went on to lodge itself into the superior margin of the 11th rib.
there could be two shooters.
or the victims were on the ground, and the killer just stood over them and shot.
which would also explain the damage to both of their skulls.
this is a pretty easy explanation. Sorry.
I realize that you might think that I'm crazy like Yoshiro Nakamatsu or Tycho Brahe, but without them, we wouldn't have the laws of planetary motion or the simple taxi meter.
it's not crazy that I'm worried about, actually.
it's arrogance.
we're a team here, and you can be traded.
wherever I go I'm always the smartest person, and it always creates problems.
well, maybe you should try being less of a douche.
could you please rotate both sets of remains 90 degrees to the left?
Yes. But you can't.
well, you were wrong about the skull damage.
they were both hit with the other's head.
Oh, my God.
I really hate to say this, but you are actually right.
in this position, the trajectory of both bullet wounds now... lines up.
it does. Perfect.
do I look humble?
I'm trying to be less of a douche.
ford's Theatre, 1865. Yep.
but you said that time travel was impossible.
it is impossible. - I'm saying if it isn't, okay?
then, like, a movie or something.
you'd... stop Lincoln from being shot?
Yeah, I would. I mean, he deserved to... know that everything turned out pretty well.
I mean, I could do it. Even if it meant that, you know, I had to put a bullet in, uh, Booth's head.
but then you might not have been...
Yeah, I know, but it's impossible.
all right, what about you? If you could travel through time, where would you go?
I'm already there. Here.
what? Here? - Here.
the difference between past and future is nowhere to be found in the laws of physics.
everything I want or need is here.
right now.
Wow. Right here?
right now?
booth.
right.
Yeah, okay, and you're sure?
Yeah, I-I'll be right down.
looks like we got Felix Garcia's drug dealer.
according to Alex, the father had been using for years.
he must've had multiple dealers.
Yeah, but here's the kicker, okay?
the dealer also works at Alex's body shop.
so he has a connection to both victims.
must not be a very good dealer if he has to work a second job.
Yeah, well, killing your customer?
that's bad for business, too.
so, how long have you been dealing heroin, Sidney?
I don't do that.
I got busted in 2009 and got off with probation.
I took it as a sign and I retired.
right. You know what this is? - Looks like a tactical baton.
found it in the trunk of your car.
I don't know, man. I go to some pretty sketchy neighborhoods.
you use it recently?
Nope.
maybe on the kneecap of a Felix Garcia?
Nope.
do you even know a Felix Garcia?
Nope.
no, okay. Let me fill you in, okay?
he owed you money for heroin.
he didn't pay you, so what do you do?
you whacked him in the kneecap with this.
he ran and he hid, and he got his son Benji to pay you off, but you shot them both.
no.
which part? - No.
you have an alibi for last Saturday night?
no.
you're gonna need a lawyer, pal.
why do I need a lawyer?
I think I'm doing pretty great on my own.
the two striations on Felix's knee are one millimeter apart, and they correspond precisely with the millimeter-sized divot at the end of Jouron's baton.
but if we hope to convict him, we need to tie his baton to perimortem damage.
Benji Garcia sustained this other injury at or very near time of death.
can you tie this to his baton as well?
what are your thoughts on asteroid mining, Dr. Wells?
well, uh, it'll definitely happen.
robotic technologies have advanced to the point where they can be self-repairing, andnear-Earth asteroids like 4660 Nereus are practical candidates for strip and magnetic extraction.
financially speaking, the key is to invest early.
if my minor in economics is worth anything, yes.
no striations. The baton was not used to inflict this damage.
so we're looking for another weapon.
look at the compression and the bending around the breaks.
what kind of weapon could come down with this kind of force at a 45-degree angle?
so, Jouron busted Felix's kneecap.
Yeah, I mean, days before either murder.
okay, so, tell me again why you want to talk to Alex Garcia.
when I asked him when he last saw his father, he stood up.
that means something.
Yeah, it means he's got a cramp in his leg.
or it means he was fleeing the question. Symbolically.
if so, he's hiding something.
Mr. Garcia, we got a warrant here to look through Sidney Jouron's locker.
were you aware that he deals drugs?
he used to.
I gave him a job here as part of his early release.
I'll open his locker for you.
uh, so, I've been thinking about you and your father...
okay, that cannot be a coincidence.
there's something going on with his dad.
I haven't seen my dad in years.
these doors here, what angle do they-they come down on?
45 degrees. Why?
45 degrees. - 45 degrees.
what's that got to do with my dad?
you slammed your brother's leg in the car door, didn't you?
after he was dead. You're saying I killed him?
I loved my brother. Why would I do that?
we're gonna find traces of blood in the seat, aren't we, Alex?
I can see it all happen.
your dad got his drugs from Sidney.
he didn't pay his debts.
Sid busts up his leg, so he comes to you two guys for help.
now, Benji thought your dad was dead so, unlike you, he was thrilled to see him.
Benji was gonna give your dad the money, so you followed him to the barn.
you didn't want to shoot Benji, but he stepped in the way.
to protect his father.
he was gonna give the old man his college money.
I couldn't let him do that.
I never meant for... All he ever wanted was to go back in time and to meet his old man.
he got his wish.
and look what happened.
the extensive amount of fracture lines are indicative of a weapon with a circular cross-section.
Hey. Usually when we catch a bad guy, we go home.
Oh, yeah, I'm just trying to commit to memory everything that I learned from Dr. Brennan.
uh, take my advice... get a notebook.
Oh, it's okay. I have a photographic memory.
okay. Good night.
see you.
we caught the murderer, Dr. Wells. You can go home.
Yeah, see, I'm just a little concerned that we may have caught him because of good luck.
there's no such thing as good luck.
well, as I understand it, if Agent Booth hadn't brought Dr. Sweets along and they hadn't seen Alex Garcia get clunked on the head, then we never would've caught the guy.
that's not luck; that's teamwork.
it's the fact that you don't believe in luck that doesn't let you see the role that it played in this investigation.
nonsense. We've been working together a long time.
and since you have a degree in complicated systems and imaginary numbers, you know that what appears to be synchronicity... luck...is nothing more than a sophisticated array of cause and effect.
I, uh... I don't have a degree in complicated systems.
Oh, well, we all have our areas of weakness.
good night, Dr. Wells.
are you saying that I'm lacking?
that's funny.
well, I didn't tell you that to make you laugh.
well...
I confess that in a moment of weakness, I took the opportunity to make Dr. Wells feel bad about himself.
he deserves it. Trust me.
it's probably the first time he's met someone that's smarter than him.
you're referring to me? - Yes.
I have another confession.
it's possible that... I'm not smarter than he is.
Really?
he saw the merit in your get rich scheme before I did.
Ah, the asteroid mining. Yes! - Yes. I invested $10, 000.
Yeah, but wait a second.
I didn't put any money into that at all.
why not?
because you're the smarter one.
I'm going to point out that if I'd trusted you from the beginning, I would've invested in the asteroids and I would've been ahead of Dr. Wells.
right, so... logically speaking, that makes me the smarter one.
no argument there?
I'm thinking. Ah, I hear nothing but asteroids.
I want you to be my husband. I want to...
spend the rest of my life with you.
will you marry me, Booth? - Yes.
of course. Yes.
there's a hacker named Christopher Pelant.
he's not a hacker anymore. Now he's a murderer.
eight people have been killed.
we have to hit him back now before one of us is dead.
you crossed a line when you shot me, Agent Booth.
do you think this is some kind of a game? - Of course.
now the rules have changed. - The two of you getting engaged, with Pelant active, he can't accept being replaced. It could cause him to escalate.
where are you? - Pretty much anywhere I want to be.
Pelant can access any security camera?
you won't marry her, Agent Booth.
and Dr. Brennan can't know the reason why you're turning her down.
if you tell her, I'll know.
if you ignore me, you'll be responsible for the deaths of five innocent people.
we need to talk.
about us getting married.
I don't think we should do it.
forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
it's been, uh...
whoa.
this is definitely not the good stuff, Father.
don't call me "Father," Master Sergeant.
I'm not a priest anymore.
I'm not in the Army anymore, so that makes us even.
how long has it been since my last confession?
eight years. - Eight years.
it's been eight years. You sure it's been eight years?
you were my last confession.
it's the kind of milestone a priest remembers.
how's about you tell me what's on your mind and leave God out of it?
I lied to the woman I love.
that's not a quick lie from the brain.
that's a whopper from the heart.
right. Which makes it a sin.
no. You want my advice, you get your ass home and tell Temperance the truth.
you have somewhere we can talk?
no, I mean a place where...
there's no TVs or radios or anything that transmits or receives or glows.
man, you are tin-foil-hat paranoid.
this guy killed how many people?
eight.
in my opinion, it's just the tip of the iceberg.
and he told you that if you married Temperance that he would choose five random human beings and kill them?
not only if I married Bones but, you know, if I told her why we couldn't get married.
you believe he'd do it? - This guy is worse than anyone you and I have ever come across.
so you and Temperance go on a camping trip, you get lost in a cave and you whisper the truth in her ear.
I love you. I want to marry you, but I can't because Plant will kill innocent people.
Pelant, okay? And she would come out of that cave and she would look all happy.
no poker face, huh? - None whatsoever.
you know what, I'm just gonna have to kill him.
whoa, n... - What? Why not?
either that or I'm just gonna have to find him and then...
and tell her why I did what I did.
so how long will it take to catch him?
I've been looking for this guy for three months and I got nothing. It's a complete dead end.
this is what he wants, right?
to drive a wedge between the two of you? - Yeah.
that's what he wants.
and he's doing a pretty good job of it, too.
well, then you'd better find him and kill him.
what are you doing here in my office?
why didn't you answer your phone?
why do you smell like bourbon?
cause I was talking to a priest, Mom, Dad, right?
okay, what is this, huh?
cause I got no problems here at work.
we're not here about work. - Then it's none of your business.
all I know, we used to be happy.
then Dr. Brennan proposed to you - Which is what you wanted. - ...and you say yes, then you say no and everybody's miserable.
how is that not our business? - It's totally our business.
it's between me and Bones.
Oh, look at that.
dead body at the Lightfoot Hotel.
hmm. Crime scene time.
have you noticed that dead bodies always save Booth from confronting his demons?
maybe that's why he smells like bourbon!
Oh, God, that's awful.
Yes, it's going to be a lot of work to get all the remains out of there.
I meant what happened to the person.
so what do you figure, huh?
suicide from the roof? Hi, Bones.
I called you earlier. - Yeah, you know,
I forgot to charge my phone.
Christine wanted to talk to her daddy.
there's a relatively large piece.
looks like it was thrown clear by the centrifugal force of the whirling fan.
supraspinous fossa, right proximal humerus.
shoulder. - The body was dragged some distance after death.
there's evidence of subluxation.
great. Okay.
he was murdered, dragged and thrown off a roof.
okay, I don't usually get involved, Seeley, but...
you got cold feet, I understand that.
however, if you don't warm up those feet real fast, you're gonna lose her forever.
mind your own business, Camille.
special Agent Booth, this is the hotel manager, - Mr. Gough. - The air conditioner turned on automatically at 8: 00 this morning.
it didn't work because of...
- Well, we know why it wasn't working. - Am I to understand that you are taking our entire air-conditioning unit?
well, the whole inside is splattered with human remains. It's no use to you.
we're also gonna need all the security footage from your security cameras.
the Lightfoot doesn't utilize cameras, Agent Booth.
what? Why not? - It's the type of hotel where you bring ladies who aren't your wife.
isn't that right, Mr. Gough? - We're renowned for our discretion.
well, we're gonna do a room-to-room check.
or maybe you'd like to help us figure out which room the victim jumped from?
we did have one guest who was supposed to check out today who has not.
the air-conditioning unit is on its way back to the lab.
do you need me for anything?
the room was registered under a fake name, paid in cash.
Yep, directly over the air-conditioning unit. Mmm.
looks like housekeeping already cleaned the room.
they haven't been here yet.
somebody else cleaned it.
well, the forensic team can sweep it for DNA and fingerprints.
I need to get back to the lab.
what? - I smell...
vodka. - Vodka. Right.
listen, Bones, um, a-about not answering the phone earlier...
I know you were lying.
and you didn't come home last night.
I was working. I have my regular hours, plus I'm trying to catch Pelant.
angela agrees. She says you're lying, too. - Angela?
well, you know, Angela doesn't know everything.
I'd die for you.
I love you.
blood.
blood.
these smears indicate that a blood spray pattern - was wiped up. - It was cleaned up by the vodka.
meaning the murder wasn't planned.
crime of passion.
this is gonna take forever.
this fan weighs 1, 200 pounds.
there are five blades, spinning at 2, 700 revolutions per minute.
it's the world's biggest body blender.
I'm gonna cancel every social occasion I have in the next three days, including a date with a fireman.
that's dedication.
more metallic fragments. - What's that?
his fillings? Well, - I've been finding what I think are parts of a cell phone, but it's pretty smashed up.
huh. I'm guessing that this is part of a wristwatch, but...
I haven't been able to find any other parts.
it's a stapes.
the small bone from the ear? - This is definitely not made of bone.
it's an artificial stapes made out of titanium.
it's used in the treatment of otosclerosis. There should be a...
serial number. - That'll give us identification much more readily than a piece of a wristwatch.
Oh, rub it in, Daisy.
Yeah, rub it in.
angela I. D.'d the victim as Jonas Siedel.
I always think it's interesting to consider that a murder victim leaves his home...
thinking he'll be back.
then he isn't.
right. So, anything else about the victim jump out at you, Bones?
maybe you should bring Sweets here to...
analyze the environment for psychological insights.
wait, you don't believe in psychological insights.
but you do.
we have many, many differences.
look, um, the victim was some kind of an accountant at the State Department.
I'm gonna go check him out. Do you want to come with me?
I better get back to the lab.
I do my best work there.
take Sweets.
sweets again.
I think it would be a better use of all of our time.
so, the victim was unmarried.
so?
single and an accountant for the State Department?
Oh, Sweets, people do have secret lives.
all right? Doesn't matter what you do for a living.
Mr. Norman can see you now.
I can't believe he's dead.
Jonas did cost-benefit analysis on various nontraditional public transportation models in Europe.
what, with bicycles?
well, none of us drive cars here.
it's public transportation, bicycles or walking all the way.
don't hang up. It's me.
why would I hang up on you?
because we don't like each other ever since you broke Brennan's heart.
I'd hang up on you.
let's move on.
Jonas Siedel's cell phone records show that somebody texted him 22 times the day before he was murdered.
who was it? - The number is registered to the Transportation Accountancy Office at the State Department.
that's exactly where we are right now.
Yeah. That's why I called.
no name? - Nope. Company-issue phone.
all right, just call now.
can you think of any reason why Jonas Siedel would check into a hotel under an assumed name?
Jonas wasn't a big one for talking about his past, that's for sure.
agent Booth, it's for you ... someone named Angela.
I don't know how she got my number, but...
she says it's important. - Actually it is very important.
I'm gonna have to take you in for questioning.
what?
Why? - It's all right, Mr. Norman.
Lily, do not say anything until I find you a lawyer.
I have a lawyer, Mr. Norman; don't worry.
everything's gonna be okay.
you guys are making a terrible mistake.
we hear that a lot.
let's go. - Wait. Wait.
look. Is this your phone?
my client has already stated that the phone belongs to her employer.
but it was assigned to you?
agent Booth, you've asked my daughter eight questions.
I've advised her not to answer any of them.
what does that tell you?
that your daughter is hiding something.
everyone has something to hide, which is why we invented lawyers.
my briefcase cost me $5, 000-- what does that tell you?
that you're bad with your money. - I'm a very good lawyer, so you might as well just cut my daughter loose right now.
did you text-message Jonas Siedel the day that he died?
do not answer that, Lily.
look, there's got to be some kind of conflict of interest here.
you know? A mother being the daughter's lawyer?
there's no conflict of interest.
but on the upside, you got one of your questions answered.
thanks for coming in.
Mm-hmm.
except one last thing.
tenacious or what? - This many text messages, combined with a fake name and a hotel room.
even if Lily did exchange texts with the victim, which she has not admitted, it does not mean sex.
that is definitely a lawyer speaking, because as a mother, you've got to know better.
look, you have to help me out here, all right?
did Jonas Siedel deserve to be murdered and tossed out that window?
not a word, Lily. Not a damn word.
Jonas did not deserve to die.
I had no sexual relationship with him, and I didn't kill him.
I hope you find who did.
"not a word" doesn't mean answer three questions, Lily.
tenacious, very tenacious.
I mean that as a compliment.
removing all of the body parts from the fan and the housing is taking too long.
unfortunately, we can't just hose it out.
Oh.
is everything all right?
uh, Booth wants to get a late lunch, but I don't think I have time.
go. - Go.
Yeah, have lunch.
okay.
Thanks. I-I won't take long.
I find I have no real appetite these days.
do you think she was speaking sexually?
Daisy! - Well, 'cause I can get her a date in a snap.
I'm seeing a fireman, and he has friends.
so, how's everything at the lab?
we're at an impasse, until we get all the human remains out of the air conditioner.
and reassemble the skeleton.
we could talk about Christine.
Christine is doing very well.
she recognizes all of her colors, and...
I think she's following along when I read to her.
or when I read to her, too.
you're talking as if...
I'm not even there.
it feels like you aren't there.
which I realize is a kind of illusion, but that's...
that's how it feels.
you know...
like you suggested, Sweets and I are gonna go check out the victim's apartment.
how was the interrogation? - Not good.
the, uh, girl's mother turned out to be a big-deal...
criminal defense lawyer, and...
she won't let her talk.
protecting her child.
but I think she wants to tell me the truth.
the truth is best.
you taught me that.
look, we're gonna...
get past all of this. - I-I don't even know what "all of this" is.
Hey.
Hey, look...
I love you, okay? You love me.
everything's gonna be okay.
I know you want me to accept what you're saying on faith
because you're a man of faith-- but I believe in patterns and sequences, and...
this sequence doesn't end well unless something disrupts the pattern.
it is not merely a case of rewiring the capacitors, even though they are nonpolarized, but flywheel and drive shafts are also affected, not to mention the complex wiring
this is not what I expected.
what did you expect? - Well, I thought maybe you'd turn it upside down and shake it.
it weighs six tons.
Oh, joking, yes.
all right, let's give it a go.
give what a go? - I'm gonna turn it on again.
what? Wait. Wait.
did you not hear me say wait?
Wow. Okay, this place is completely different from when me and Bones checked it out.
Wow. It's, like, no photos, no...
artwork or collectibles.
this furniture's obviously rented.
sweets, everything is gone.
nothing's here; everything was taken out.
maybe the condo people moved it into storage.
this computer might tell us something.
Yeah, I was hoping you'd be able to give me some insight into how this guy ticks.
books are gone.
I think there was a kayak over here.
booth! The window!
how many?
freeze. FBI.
Ooh, FBI. I'm shaking.
Danny? - You look like hell, Booth.
you need to eat vegetables, get some sleep.
so what are we gonna do, we gonna just shoot each other?
not here.
bad grade school memories.
all right.
so I guess you're not gonna tell me what you were doing in that apartment, huh?
I was there doing what I do.
that sort of tells you everything you need to know.
Ha-ha. Okay.
see you, Danny.
he's getting away.
he's... - Yep.
he's getting away.
he's getting away. Looks that way.
who is that guy?
that was Danny Beck.
old Army buddy.
he's CIA.
so, Jonas Siedel was CIA.
that introduces a lot of suspects.
Yeah, including Iran and North Korea, and everyone else in the world that's mad at us. So this whole accountant-studying- European-transportation thing - was a cover? - Look, Danny was just making sure that the apartment was sanitized; that's what he does.
Oh.
okay, so it's not in any way my fault that I couldn't get anything off the apartment, then.
interesting.
Why?
Danny has nothing against us solving Siedel's murder.
he's just not gonna help.
look, the CIA's gonna work it from their side, we'll work it from our side.
we are at war with the CIA?
that's a little melodramatic.
Hey, they have killer robot drones, Cam.
read a newspaper.
you seem very interested in this Band-Aid.
leave no stone unturned, Dr. Hodgins.
I'll check out the wound, you'll run tests on the Band-Aid.
so we're really desperate on this one, huh?
going down for the third time. - Hey.
how much would you give me if it's a small puncture wound of the sort that would be delivered by a hypodermic needle full of untraceable CIA poison?
let's pursue a few less exotic options first, okay?
Yeah.
sure.
just a minor abrasion.
so, this is our cause of death.
a boo-boo.
every single hard drive, memory card and piece of memory has been removed, erased.
look, just do the best that you can.
booth, without memory, computers are just toasters.
there's no information.
well, crumbs in a toaster can tell you what someone had for breakfast, huh?
well, a bagel?
raisin toast? A crumpet?
you want me to look for crumpet crumbs?
is there anything else?
Yeah, there is something else.
stop telling Bones I'm lying to her.
what's the problem, Booth?
what, do you need one more fling before settling down?
I'm not a fling kind of a guy, and you know that.
maybe Brennan isn't as attractive to you now that she's become a mom.
you're not helping the situation.
you're ruining her very fragile heart.
you should be ashamed of yourself!
Seeley, I got customers out there.
in three minutes, they're gonna start serving themselves.
look, I just have a fast question, Father.
Aldo. Aldo, right. Look, - I would sacrifice my own life for Bones, all right? I would kill for her.
then why am I not calling Pelant's bluff, huh?
I mean, it's not my fault - I put first the happiness of the woman I love. - That's true.
it's true, right? - One question.
when Temperance finds out that you put her happiness ahead of the lives of five innocent people, how will she react?
you knew the answer already.
you just needed to hear me say it.
Hey, do me a favor.
pass these around to a couple of your hard-drinking FBI pals and don't tell any of them that I used to be a priest.
Hey, Aldo!
right.
the challenge now is to figure out which of these injuries occurred before death, which caused death, and which were caused after the body fell through a rusty grate into a giant spinning propeller.
there's a diffuse pattern of remodeled injuries that occurred at the same time approximately six years ago.
I thought maybe it was a car accident, but the fracturing appears random and spread over the entire body.
it's a bomb, Daisy.
but there's no sign of shrapnel.
but these butterfly fractures on the visceral surface of the ribs resulted from a bending force.
a shockwave.
that's why he had a prosthetic stapes.
the blast deafened him.
being a CIA operative is a very tough gig.
it's really getting late.
Ooh, I hope we got Sleepy Hollow on the DVR.
booth is punishing me.
I know that you think that I should stay out of it, but detachment isn't really my thing.
what's with the printer? - I know what you did there.
you detached. - I am telling you, Angie, there is something going on with Booth that we don't know about.
so, what is with the printer?
well, the CIA removed all the memory, but what if I could re-create the final image that the printer printed?
ghosting. Oh, that is awesome.
Hey, can I make a suggestion?
lay off Booth?
Yes, and run triturated laundry detergent through the printer drum instead of toner.
Why?
um, because laundry detergents contain triazine-stilbenes and benzoxazolines.
you know what?
I don't need to know why, because I've learned to have faith in you, even when you use words like "triturate."
thank you. Mm-hmm.
for almost all the injuries postdating the remodeled fractures the victim sustained in the explosion six years ago, congruent with multiple strikes from the air-conditioning unit blades.
those injuries are obscuring the cause of death.
we need to ask ourselves, what injuries match the height of the blood spatter in the hotel room?
two and a half to three meters.
so, head wound.
here in the right temporoparietal.
the injury measures 62. 8 by 35. 2 millimeters.
there's another impact on the left temporoparietal.
both wounds are consistent with a slow-loading force.
so, not from the blades or the fall.
a low-velocity blunt trauma.
he was conked on the head... twice.
which gives us cause of death.
would you care to high-five?
I would not.
I can do it myself.
okay. How about you come out in here and see me?
first come, first served.
we've ascertained cause of death. It was lateral thinking...
stop.
Dr. Brennan.
cause of death was two blows to the head. - Angela?
the last thing the victim printed was a photograph.
a white cat in a snowstorm?
it's a ghost of the last photo that came out of his printer.
Ooh, sexy hotel sex.
that's the room at the Lightfoot.
Hey, the logo on the headboard ...
is the same in this photograph. - That could be Lily Thorn.
Oh, it could also be me.
we'd all understand if it were.
it's not. I'm just saying that she's not identifiable.
body type tells us that this man's not the victim.
Oh, you think the victim interrupted this liaison, and this man hit him with a blunt object and threw him out the window?
how do we identify the man?
well, his name is H. Gloeckner.
how did you know that?
it's on his briefcase.
my name is Heinrich Gloeckner.
I am chief executive officer of Gloeckner AG based in Hamburg, Germany.
AG? Doesn't that mean it's a public corporation with shareholders and a board?
Yes. Which is why I'm here, cooperating, in the hopes you will be discreet when you realize
I had nothing to do with this murder.
right, okay. Well, let's say we play a little game of show-and-tell, huh?
shall we? Let's start with the identity of this young woman right here.
um, she gave me the name Melody.
I assume it was false.
Yes.
this is Melody. - And?
he said his name was John.
also a lie, I assume.
were John and Melody blackmailing you?
no, it did not come to that.
John showed me this photo to demonstrate he had other, more incriminating photos if I reneged on our deal.
what deal? - John wanted my company to employ a team of outside consultants to work on a Chinese dam project.
your company makes dams? - My company makes pumps.
pumps?
um, this is the, uh...
the team of consultants based in Terre Haute, Indiana.
Why? - I assumed
John and Melody were American spies who were looking to find a way into the Chinese mega-projects.
is the consulting contract worth a lot of money?
no. It's a pittance.
certainly not worth killing for.
she made me think she liked me.
and you met with Melody at...? - Perhaps 10: 00.
uh, she left my room after midnight.
John came in, showed me the photo, and I left.
what time? - Before 1: 00 a. m.
I can go?
afraid not.
agent Booth, do I strike you as a kind of man who would be foolish enough to murder a CIA agent?
Angela, how long have you been with Hodgins?
um, working together ten years, sleeping together five years and married three years.
with regard to the murder weapon, we should try to be more specific.
Yes, Dr. Brennan.
wait. What? - We should figure out if it's a pipe or a baseball bat - or something else. - No, I mean, you can't just ask a loaded question like, "How long have you been with Hodgins?"
and then go back to work stuff.
I wanted to compare your experience with Hodgins to recent brain chemistry discoveries and my current situation with Booth.
what recent brain chemistry discoveries?
she asked, even though she doesn't care.
phase one of what we call love is an overload of neurotransmitters.
it feels like falling. Thus, falling in love.
exactly. Phase one lasts less than a year.
no, no, no. - Phase two involves the production of oxytocin and vasopressin, particularly after orgasm.
that's correct. - Lance and I had a lot of phase two.
phase two either evolves into long-term attachment or, much more frequently, fails, and the search begins for another phase one stimulation with... a new lover.
love is not chemistry.
I'm sensing you have evidence that Booth's neocortex is propelling him towards new phase one stimulation?
booth has been going to a strip club.
that-that does not sound right.
well, I found several of these in his pocket.
paradise Lost?
starting over isn't so bad, Dr. Brennan.
lance and I are friends now.
stop talking, Daisy. - You and Booth will be just like me and Lance, I prom...
Oh. - Angela!
I warned her.
everybody heard me.
we know that you were involved in a sex sting on a foreign national.
don't say a word.
we don't think you killed anyone.
we also know that Jonas Siedel recruited you on behalf of the CIA.
what?
is that true?
mom, you're supposed to be my lawyer in here, not my mom.
you've been lying to me?
Jonas didn't call the shots.
Lily here set the honey pot. - It's my job to keep secrets, Agent Booth.
I can't help you.
this interview is over.
my lawyer is, for once, right.
look, Lily, what if I could persuade you just to answer a couple more questions?
I don't think that's possible.
if this operation was as top secret as you thought it was, don't you think
Danny and the CIA would have shut us down by now?
in fact, I think Danny worked it so that I would catch him.
might as well have told us Jonas Siedel's murder didn't have anything to do with his CIA work.
whether you like Jonas Siedel or not, you could at least help us catch his killer.
even your mama would agree with that.
I certainly do not agree.
mom, you're gonna have to leave.
what?
honey, I am your lawyer.
I don't need a lawyer.
what do you want to know?
so, when you last saw Jonas, - he was with the German? - Yes.
around midnight. - You see that German killing Jonas?
no.
did you see anyone else?
earlier in the evening, my mother was at the bar.
by coincidence.
I'm afraid ... she formed the idea that I was an escort.
imagine her relief when she found out you were a patriot.
thanks for helping us out.
Dr. Brennan, your report states that the Band-Aid we found was likely on Jonas Siedel's jaw?
Yes.
the tissue trauma's size and severity matches the bone bruising to the left mandible.
given that you are still in the...
first year of your sexual relationship with Arastoo and so deeply in the grip of dopamine...
I know this is about Booth, and my advice to you would be to trust him.
I feel the intense feelings of romantic love are fading from our relationship.
have you looked at Booth lately? He's miserable.
if what you're suggesting were actually true, you'd both be experiencing relief.
do you feel relieved?
I don't always know what I'm feeling.
well, you are not relieved, Dr. Brennan.
you're miserable. And so is Booth.
and that is love.
the... blow to the victim's jaw took place approximately eight hours before his death, so I'm... not sure they're related.
Dr. Hodgins found traces of rose oil in the Band-Aid.
so he was struck with something made of leather?
something made of really, really expensive leather.
I'd appreciate it if you passed this information - on to Booth. - No.
why can't you do it?
because I'm asking you to do it, please.
Wow. Okay, well, thanks for meeting us here, Ms. Thorn.
who is this? - This...
Oh, this here is my associate, Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian Institution.
smart girl, huh?
Yes. Very smart.
you have a cruel sense of humor, asking me to the hotel where my daughter plies her trade as what is apparently a... patriotic prostitute.
well, she told us that you thought that she was an escort.
Oh, God, well, uh, Lily had become very evasive lately, so I followed her here.
she was all dolled up, talking to a man about meeting another man.
and I jumped to conclusions. What is this?
it's a warrant for your briefcase.
Yeah, the $5, 000 briefcase you hit Jonas Siedel with because you thought he was your daughter's pimp.
you're under arrest, Marianne Thorn, for the murder of Jonas Siedel. Based on particulate evidence.
that can be easily explain away in court.
besides, brainiac here will tell you that whoever hit Jonas Siedel in the jaw with my briefcase did it several hours before he died.
we never said where you hit him.
right. She got you. Come on. Let's go.
I stipulate to the assault.
it's cruel and unusual punishment not to let a woman finish her martini after the day I've had.
well, I have to get my digs in somehow, Ms. Thorn.
come on. Really?
really. Okay.
that's it.
all right.
Oh, come on in.
it's ladies' night.
there are no ladies here.
uh, maybe you're the beginning of a trend.
wine?
I... I'll have the ladies' special.
you're Booth's girl?
I wouldn't use the term "girl."
I'm Aldo Clemens.
I used to be Booth's confessor when he was a Ranger.
me and him are having a tough time breaking the habit even though Booth's the reason I quit being a priest and decided God was my worst enemy.
God is a myth.
no, I don't think so.
I think he's a bastard.
booth was a sniper.
he asked for forgiveness from you every time he killed somebody?
through me, technically.
you can imagine why a guy might get soul-sick providing absolution.
I don't believe in souls, either.
booth loves you.
booth told you that?
he confessed it to me.
not being married is a sin to him.
I'm not sure a nonbeliever can understand that kind of sacrifice.
I wanted to marry him.
not as much as he wants to marry you.
do you want me to have faith in him?
you know, I've seen Booth do some terrible and... and difficult things, but only if he was compelled by a very good reason.
are you asleep?
if you are, I'd like you to wake up now.
I watched the tapes of you interrogating that lawyer lady.
you weren't very nice.
as if I needed another reason to adore you.
so what do you think?
I think she's telling the truth.
which leaves us nowhere.
so why are you sleeping?
Oh!
that's cause of death.
so, anything we found in the hotel room match the weapon?
no. Meaning the killer brought a three-foot-long pole with him, conked Siedel on the head, and then took it with him when he left?
so it's a cane? - Well, if a cane could bend. See, it struck him here, and then wrapped around there.
and there was something on the end of whatever that was that whipped into his temple.
what are you thinking, Booth?
you know, everyone was fooled by this innocent-looking girl: me, Sweets, the mother.
so you think the murderer was someone else who misread her?
all I'm saying is when we took Lily Thorn in for questioning, her boss seemed to think that she could do no wrong.
does Lily's boss carry around a weirdly flexible cane that could smash a temple?
I thought Jonas was taking advantage of Lily, using his superior position to press her into having an affair with him.
so I followed him to that hotel, and he...
...he gave her to another man.
I confronted him, and he said it was none of my business.
I just, I snapped.
I didn't mean to kill him.
I did it for you.
got the guy, huh?
Yeah, we got the guy...
thanks to you. - I didn't do anything.
I mean, seriously, if anyone asks, I didn't do anything.
okay.
what do you want, Danny?
to tell you we owe you one.
the CIA owes me one?
you don't got to put labels on everything, Booth.
I said we owe you one, we owe you one.
all right, you owe me one. Thanks.
and you know there's always a place for you with us, you ever decide to leave this... cute little job you got here.
well, the way things are going right now,
I might just take you up on that.
take care.
Yeah.
did he confess?
Yeah. He was hoping that no one would be able to identify the body or see the cause of death if he dumped the body into the air-conditioning unit.
booth, I have to tell you something.
uh, all right, look, Bones, please, just...
you just got to give me a little more time, that's all, please.
no, Booth, I'm not...
I'm not leaving you.
what I want to tell you is that I have absolute faith in you.
I trust you.
I know you love me and Christine, and...
I'm sorry I lost sight of that temporarily.
you're a good man.
you have your reasons, and...
...when you can, you'll share them with me.
I'm sorry.
look, I'm sorry...
we'll be fine.
but next time, it's your turn to ask me to marry you.
I will.
as soon as I can, I will.
I know.
bobcats, in the city. Seriously.
Habitat's just over those hills.
who doesn't like to come into town for a nice meal every now and then, hmm?
I thought this job this job was about dogs and cats.
well, it's just like a cat, named Bob.
look, bobcats are more scared of us than we are of them.
Oh, my God.
there it is.
wait till you see the teeth on these suckers.
come on, come on.
you can always get laid with a story about catching a bobcat.
now slowly go behind the Dumpster.
I-I got him!
okay, now hand him over.
get a sample of what he was feeding on, in case he gets sick.
hurry up!
there's a lot of stuff here.
if he craps in this van, you're cleaning it up.
I got it.
he was feeding on this.
okay... and now you're going to learn about paperwork.
this is the third letter I've gotten from a collection agency.
they probably just mixed you up with someone else.
no, they all have my Social Security number, correct address...
but I know I didn't buy a portable tool shed for $1, 800.
it's nice, riding in together.
easier than going back to separate places.
that was subtle.
and now that you have that tool shed, we'd have plenty of room.
Oh, man, now what?
with this car, it could be anything.
Hey! I got the taillight fixed, and the exhaust.
well, you definitely weren't speeding.
I don't think you could in this thing.
license and registration, sir. Ma'am. - Of course.
excuse me, Officer, can I ask why you pulled us over?
doesn't really concern you, ma'am.
why don't you sit back while your boyfriend does what I asked?
"boyfriend"? Okay.
I think it's pretty clear why you pulled us over.
cam. - He was driving erratically, ma'am.
uh, no, he was driving while brown.
let it go, Cam. - No.
I'd listen to him, ma'am.
what is it? Did you do a little time in the Middle East, maybe?
you didn't like the way he looked? Or maybe me?
I. D.ma'am. - Oh, seriously?
now!
I am the Head of the Forensic Division at the Jeffersonian Institution.
and I am on my way to a case, so... - Let it go. It's a stupid ticket.
no. I will not let something like this go, and neither should you.
you know there's a fine line...
warrants outstanding for check fraud, credit card fraud and grand theft...
out of the car! Out of the car. Now. - What?
Oh, my God... What is going on? - What the hell is going on?
Camille Saroyan, step out of the car.
what?
turn around and step away from the car, please. - Okay.
you're under arrest for check and credit card fraud, and grand theft.
what? - No, there must be some mistake.
I'd stay out of this if I were you, buddy. You have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney,
look, I can't believe anyone would think she was capable of check fraud.
of course she's capable.
what are you talking about?
I don't believe she did it.
but she certainly has the intellectual acumen for it.
okay. You definitely should not be a character witness.
whoa. No hazardous waste accepted... What is this?
wow, bobcat feast.
judging by the use of debris to cover the remains between feedings, our victim's been here at least six hours.
Hey, is Cam out of the hoosegow yet?
Yeah, I called in a favor, had the bail hearing moved up.
she should be out in a few hours. Whoa, hello.
puncture marks on the head of the humerus indicate that the bobcat severed the arms from the body.
what's that smell? - Oh, yeah.
Bobcats? They mark their feeding area with urine and, if you're lucky, feces.
look, was this guy alive when he was ripped apart?
I mean, is this something we should be even involved in?
if Dr. Saroyan wasn't incarcerated, she'd note that the decomposition of this tissue indicates that the victim was dead six to 12 hours before the bobcat started feeding.
so it was a body dump.
have you found the skull, Dr. Hodgins?
no... Bobcats often carry their food into trees to consume it.
well, there we go.
Yep. Our animal friends are so predictable.
feces.
it's your lucky day, Bug Boy.
awesome.
the extensive number of fractures evident on these X-rays indicate blunt force trauma as cause of death.
Yeah, lots of blunt force and lots of trauma, by the looks of it.
and completed ossification of the clavicle indicates the victim was in his early 30s, and...
Arastoo? - Yeah, sorry.
I'm still... it was like Cam was daring the cop to bust her.
was the cop racist?
you could take it that way, yeah.
racism is racism.
right, sweetie?
I have found, as a Caucasian, if I enter into any kind of debate like this, the non-Caucasians, like you and Arastoo, yell at me, as if I represent all white people.
I tend to represent all Muslims.
I tend to represent all hot women.
I don't know if you can classify "hot women" as a race.
excuse me? I'm about to breach security, so if one of you could...
what's wrong with your card?
the same thing that's wrong with my credit cards, my bank card, the reason why my online stock trading account's been frozen...
you trade in the stock market? - No.
apparently, I've been the victim of identity theft.
you got arrested because someone else broke the law?
using my identity, yes.
and it's still happening.
but I really don't want to deal with this at work, so let's drop it, okay?
what do you mean, it's still happening?
until they catch whoever stole her identity, they can...
this is not dropping it.
the brain seems to be the only organ that the bobcat didn't get at.
okay, with all this damage, the facial reconstruction is gonna take a while.
the victim has areas of very dense bone around his pelvis and vertebral spine.
also, calcification of the lateral and medial collateral ligaments.
skeletal fluorosis? How is that possible? There's no evidence of bone deformation.
early stages. And extremely rare in North America.
any diagnosed cases would be reported to the Department of Public Health.
very good, then, Mr. Vaziri.
if our victim sought treatment in the U. S.it means he's registered.
Hey. Sweets.
got an identity on the victim.
he was single, right? His clothes and his lack of ring...
married. - Blue collar?
management consultant. Also, Korean.
I got everything wrong?
well, you know what? Not everything. I mean, you did say that he was a guy. Okay?
come on, you know, everybody has a bad day. You know what you do?
you just gotta walk it off, all right, buddy?
get back in the game.
Adam Pak. Is there anything in the missing persons database?
Nope.
so, then, why didn't his wife report him missing?
well, that's your department. Come on, let's go! Get into it.
it's time to, you know, regain your self-respect... Oh, look at that.
noodle soup.
"asian Noodle Fun." That's good.
wait, those are my noodles.
they're mine now.
Adam's... dead?
are you sure it's him?
God, I can't... - You'll be all right.
just deep breaths, in and out.
what's wrong with her?
well... I think we'll find that Mrs. Pak suffers from a panic disorder, am I correct?
no, I'm just trying not to cry.
okay, when was the last time you saw your husband?
three days ago. He left on a business trip to Thailand.
he was a management consultant.
Yes. Um, lots of international clients, so he... he travels a lot.
did you speak to him while he was away?
last night.
I bet he calls you every night when he's away, doesn't he? - No, I called him.
any reason why you would call him?
I heard someone downstairs.
I thought it was Adam, so I called to make sure.
he told me I was imagining things, like always.
and then h-he hung up and I called the security company.
I bet they told you that you were right to call, though.
no, they think I'm crazy nervous.
I called them three or more times during the night.
Mrs. Pak, you realize that your husband, he wasn't killed in Thailand.
he was found here in the United States.
can you think of any reason, you know, I don't know, why he would lie to you?
I mean, he must have had a good reason.
but you were here all of last night?
like I told you. If you don't believe me, ask the security company.
what will I do without Adam?
what do you got?
advice about identity theft.
Thanks, but no thanks.
I found traces of agricultural lime on the victim's clothing.
I'm guessing you're not talking about a fruit.
it's a substance used to make acidic soil more habitable for plants.
how common is it? - It's fairly common.
and a recent study in Tennessee showed that the presence of agricultural lime actually increases bobcat visitation rates.
so the lime attracted the bobcat to his remains.
there are warrants out for your arrest.
your credit score's gonna flat line.
you're not gonna be able to get money out of an ATM, your assets are going to end up being frozen...
I also found Chironomidae from the nematoceran fly family... And soil.
soil with a... it's a very high acidic ratio and greater clay subsoil component.
can you cross-reference?
Seriously?
there's only one place where these both coexist...
it's on Native American tribal land in Virginia.
our Korean victim was killed on an Indian reservation?
your wages will be garnished.
you need a lawyer.
I'm pretty sure I can handle this on my own.
cam. You got blocked from the forensic platform.
you need a lawyer.
and one that's gonna trust you because he trusts me.
thank you.
thank you.
if I leave now, you're not gonna come up with another clue, are you?
I'm all out.
I should probably leave before Booth gets home.
Yes, you should.
Really?
Angela, you're being very mean to him.
anger is a reasonable response.
why aren't you mad at him?
I mean, he forces you to propose to him, he accepts, and then he changes his mind.
he has his reasons.
yeah? What reasons?
I don't know.
then why aren't you angry at him?
I don't know why Mars lost its magnetic field.
I'm not angry at Mars.
that's fine, I'll be angry at both Booth and Mars for you.
awkward.
Bye, sweetie.
Bye.- Good-bye.
that's the best word I've heard all day.
so, part of the Indian tribal land is being leased to a company called New Dawn Retreat.
what's that? - It's a marriage retreat. Get this, okay?
one of the registered couples was under the name of Adam and Kelly Pak.
but the victim's wife was at home and... her name is Emma.
getting permission for the FBI to go onto tribal land...
that takes months, you know?
and this marriage retreat is over in two days.
by that time, any witnesses will have left the retreat.
and possibly the killer.
so, you know what I'm thinking?
undercover. - Yeah.
buck and Wanda. - Not Buck and Wanda.
this is a job for... Tony, Roxie.
Tony and Roxie.
okay, you've got it, big boy! - How you doin', baby?
Yeah, how you doin'?- No, no, no, it's-it's,"How you doin'?
how ya doin'? No, you're using your nose too much.
you'll be joining our introductory group;
people like yourselves who are finally brave enough to confront their problems.
Oh, no, no, we got no problems.
Oh, we got problems, Tony.
what are you talking about? Slow down. - Come on...
I think we fit pretty good in all the right places, huh?
without opening your hearts and letting love bathe the pain, you'll never grow to the oneness you need to flourish.
look at them. Look how united they are.
everybody, slow down!
we don't have to do any of that stuff, huh?
that's an advanced course.
those couples have already taken both the introductory and intermediate sessions.
they got problems, you know advanced problems.
well, lots and lots of money for you, I imagine, Mr. Little River.
all right, take it easy on him, okay, Roxie?
listen, the guy's trying to run a business.
he likes helping people.
all feeling and no brains, this one.
the majority of the money goes back into the facility and for research into the psycho-structure of interpersonal relations.
okay, one thing I don't understand is this guy right here.
then perhaps you use your head too much...
slow down. - ...and your heart not enough.
you know, he makes a good point.
Seriously? Just saying, Bones.
okay, stop... just keep the act up, will ya?
hemorrhagic staining on the inside of the frontal bone.
perimortem fractures to the skull, ribs, pelvis and the proximal end of both femurs.
brittle bones.
that would account for the severity of the fractures.
making it hard to determine the true force with which he was struck.
which makes it tough to determine what he was hit with.
damn.
the manager at my bank can't help.
he's gonna have to freeze all the accounts until this is worked out.
and your credit cards?
all canceled. All of them.
what about Hodgins' lawyer? - I didn't think I'd need him.
why do you always refuse help?
you need him. And I'll give you some money until...
no, thank you. But I can take care of this myself.
cam... - No.
okay.
so I guess you won't let me pay for dinner either.
can I at least suggest a Dumpster that you might enjoy, behind the supermarket?
I never should have brought this up at work.
of course not. That's for normal people.
I just, I need to focus on the case.
something I can control.
you understand.
I do.
so?
okay... so here's what I got so far.
based on the angles of the segmented fracture in the left femur,
I realized there's a dual directionality to the victim's injuries.
basically, he was smacked from one direction and then smacked from the other direction almost simultaneously.
so, two assailants?
that complicates things.
Yeah. That should take your mind off your problems for a while.
we're supposed to be doing our exercises even if Shaman Little River isn't here.
he said.
so you're the perfect one, like always.
word of advice, pet, if you want to live to our age, take a breath.
what, you think we make 72 look good?
well, maybe you're in your 70s, old man, but I am...
look, the boys have got marriage problems, Evelyn.
they're not blind.
everyone, this is Tony and Roxie Scallion.
how you doin'? - How you doin'?
how's it going, eh? How are ya?
what's your problem, kids? Too beautiful?
Oh, thank you. You flatter.
we talked about your hostility, Evelyn.
Yeah, good luck with that.
Oh, thank you, Shaman. Kelly and Adam Pak aren't here.
I went to their tent to check, but wanted to start anyway, like you said.
of course he did.
the world would stop spinning if you weren't a good boy.
his behavior has nothing to do with the rotation of the earth, doll.
I like her. - So, who are the Paks?
Oh, they make all of us look happily married.
let's not worry about other people, Evelyn.
whoa, slow down, okay?
didn't you say that we could learn from each other, okay?
what were their problems?
Kelly thought Adam was holding something back from her.
and I agree. He had secrets. You could tell.
everyone has something they're afraid to tell their partner.
but if you find the courage to open up, it's always for the best.
Tony has secrets from me. - What?
that must be very painful for you.
Really?
what is it, Tony, getting a little something on the side?
okay, all right, you know what? We don't have to start with me first.
Oh, no, no, no.
out with it, Tony.
come on, huh?
I have a secret that I'll share.
that's beautiful.
thank you.
I never told you how much I dislike it when you wear that beer hat in the bath.
you look foolish, and sometimes it makes me think that I married a child.
you're kidding me right?
no, Tony, I ain't.
we'll talk about the hat after you lose that stupid African fertility statue out of the bedroom.
you know what? On top of it, you know, you should cut off his...
we don't use anger here.
but it's an exquisite carving.
I find it inspirational.
I love this girl.
in my experience... petty issues like this usually mask a larger secret.
like the money you don't tell me you spend.
Oh, my God. Once!
that was one time.
and you love the canoe!
so don't, don't start.
sorry, sorry, sorry.
I am so, so, so sorry I'm late.
that's okay. Where's Adam, Kelly?
I don't know.
we got into a huge fight last night, and he just ran off.
I've been calling and calling, but he's not answering.
because it's finished.
I'll take her picture so we can I. D. her.
maybe we should call the cops.
I've seen this a hundred times.
working on a relationship is a difficult thing.
and you both have tempers, lovey.
he'll be back.
until then... let the group soothe you.
one heart.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, one heart. You like that.
Roxie, Tony, It's time to meld.
bring it in here, big guy.
I don't think so.
a great couple of melders you are.
there we are.
one heart.
we're actually talking eight hearts here.
most damage was confined to his pelvis and upper femurs, anterior and posterior.
the front of his pants contained tree bark and pine needles.
but there was also a bunch of refuse from the gardeners in the Dumpster, so I'm sorting through it now for genus and species.
as soon as you can.
I'd like to give Cam some good news.
is it true that the prosecutor is going ahead with the case against her?
to the banks and the credit card companies, she's just an account number.
they're not gonna drop the charges until they get proof it wasn't her.
what did the lawyer say? - You know Cam.
she wanted to take care of it herself.
I like the idea of separating the boys and girls.
it would be fun to have a little girl talk.
Oh, I don't know.
we've been to a lot of these.
I don't like being away from Bill.
after 38 years, that's pretty good.
Whoa! We have our fights, but I can't imagine life without this old bat.
you wrinkled old fart.
so why do you keep coming to these things?
well, we get to travel, we're together and we get to watch all these crazy bastards.
so, Kelly Pak is probably very entertaining, huh?
Oh, you don't know the half of it.
wait till we all sweat together.
sweat? All sweat?
Yeah, we, uh, sweat over here.
sweat over here?
sweat over there.
shaman Little River says we come in here to sweat out the toxins that can cause emotional pain.
well, he's wrong. You can't sweat out toxins.
a sweat lodge can actually cause your kidneys to retain water, preventing your body from eliminating toxins.
how on earth do you know all that?
um, reading... you know, the magazines you find at the checkout counter at the grocery store?
that's how I know that whole sweat-toxin thing is whole lot of New Age crapola.
I mean, if that's true, what are we doing in here? I mean, I'm roasting.
well, traditionally, it's used to call on our ancestors to help and guide us through difficulty.
peyote is sometimes used to facilitate this.
Oh, I would never take drugs.
you sure could use something to chill out that temper of yours, sweetie, if you want to keep a man.
Adam will be back.
are those tears or sweat, doll?
I don't want to talk about it.
you having a seizure, love?
I'm calling on Kelly's ancestors to help her talk.
Oh, not... not my mother.
Oh, please, not my mother.
ali-frazier was the best fight of all time.- Oh, you're on crack.
excuse me. We're in here for a reason.
I agree with Tony. Yeah.
two undefeated champs slugging it out for the belt... Winner take all.
best fight ever!
you're comparing this to Rumble in the Jungle?
ali hired Larry Holmes to pound on him so he could take punches from Foreman.
it was a slugfest.
you know? There was no artistry.
we're supposed to be talking about our relationships.
Yeah, we are, son.
talking about our relationship with boxing.
fine. You're all wrong!
Hagler-Hearns, 1985, is the greatest fight ever.
Hagler throws 42 punches to Hearns's 56 in the first round alone!
only three rounds total, and in the end, Hagler, bleeding, knocks out Hearns to secure his legacy as the greatest middleweight ever.
eight minutes of toe-to-toe bloody magic... no contest!
now... if we could apply to our relationships a fraction of the focus that we do to boxing, we wouldn't need to be sweating in here, now, would we?
fair enough. Yeah, all right.
you know what relationship I'm really interested in?
is that, uh, who is that, Kelly and, uh... Adam. - Adam.
Oh, bad.
bad, huh? How bad?
Yeah, they had secrets. - Secrets?
you don't know that. - I know.
they said they'd just gotten married, right?
but there was no newlywed vibe.
even we had a newlywed vibe.
well, you still do.
but we're talking about Kelly now, so... - I agree, we still do.
well, you're just saying that because we're sweating.
uh, no, I'm not.
I love you.
Oh, guys...
I think Adam was having an affair.
Kelly was crazy jealous. Real Housewives jealous.
Adam kept telling me how much he loved me.
all the time.
your ancestors want me to ask you if Adam ever showed you how much he loved you?
Seriously? - Yeah.
Yeah, they-they want you to talk.
Yeah, especially your mother.
I thought he loved me.
but he wouldn't leave his damn wife.
the things I said to him. And did.
I hurt him so bad.
I-I didn't mean to.
I swear, I love Adam.
you look nowhere near ready to leave.
Oh, what time is it?
I got lost researching Kelly Pak, who, of course, is not Kelly Pak, but in actuality is really Kelly Goodman.
wow, that takes commitment... bringing your mistress to a couples retreat?
Yeah, Booth said they were working out their anger issues.
what are these?
quiet.
Wha...? I saw Cam's name.
and bank statements.
Yeah.
well, I'm looking for the fake Cam.
well, great. Why the secrecy?
Seriously?
you know how Cam is.
do you know how fabulous you are?
well, I had to do something.
unfortunately, it's easier to find the Higgs boson than it is to recover a stolen identity.
Mmm, nice Higgs reference.
Hey, you noticed.
I'm gonna keep trying.
so, what's all this money? Is that fake, too?
no.
this is real and it has nothing to do with Cam.
these are Kelly Goodman's bank statements over the last year.
and that is a wire transfer for over 900 grand she received five months ago from the estate of her last boyfriend.
estate?
Yeah, he died.
but not before he changed his will.
two dead boyfriends back to back.
looks like Kelly Goodman never worked on those anger issues.
I found fracturing around the bony wall socket of the victim's two upper front teeth.
well, I'm not an expert on everything, but doesn't that happen when your teeth knocked out?
they weren't knocked out, they were yanked out.
no roots.
maybe his mistress tortured him for his financial passwords before killing him.
no, you don't need to torture to get passwords. Ask Cam.
thanks for the lawyer. Cam's all cheered up.
it's still gonna take months.
you know? Maybe even years.
What?! She doesn't even have money for dinner.
trust me, man, okay?
thanks to Pelant, I know what it's like to lose everything.
I asked you here because, uh, I found this lodged in the teeth.
well, I'll check it out.
she's gonna be okay, Arastoo, okay?
just maybe not in the next few days.
or... weeks. Or...
I get it.
leave? You can't leave.
you think about leaving every day.
no, I don't.
I'm not at the top of my game right now, so please don't lie to me.
all right, fine. I think about leaving.
there you go.
but I'm a wild, free spirit artist-type with wanderlust, and you're a tight-assed geek boy who doesn't really fit in anywhere but here. No offense.
I got into psychology to help people.
and you are.
no, I'm... I mean individuals.
not just law enforcement.
I'm supposed to be a healer.
you remember last year, that young girl who was raped?
she came to me for help.
what did I do?
I referred her to someone else.
that's helping. - No!
it's delegating. Sweets.
sweets, please tell me that Kelly killed her last boyfriend.
actually, he died in a car accident.
she was nowhere near the scene.
Hey, look, what about Shaman Touchy Feely?
uh, oh, get this.
shaman Little River is actually named Jeremy Brewster.
he changed his name ten years ago.
good work, Sweets.
don't patronize me. I'm relaying a message.
there's no psychological insight involved here.
sweets, relax.
I'm just record-keeping.
okay, why'd he change his name?
maybe he was unhappy with the non-integration of his childhood personae.
Sweets! Just check his file. There's got to be a reason.
okay, well... He had priors.
DUIs, assault, money fraud.
thank you. Assault.
all right? He has a temper.
listen, you're just freaking out because Pelant hacked into all your research on all of us and then used it against us.
you feel guilty.
thank you, Dr. Montenegro.
Where'd you get your degree in psychology again?
the same place you got that degree in sarcasm.
listen, we all feel responsible.
but we're not running away.
I'm not running away, okay?
I'm trying to get back to the real world.
start helping people.
be a psychologist again.
get my hands dirty.
this is an exercise of trust and communication.
one of each couple will don this protective suit, which includes the blindfold.
the other will talk his or her spouse through the course.
but first, choose who's gonna do what.
suit 'em.
right... over here. One suit over here for him.
no, I'll-I'll wear that one. Right here.
ease up. Step over that log. That's it, honey.
right over there... oh!
Oh, sweetheart. Come on. Are you okay, honey?
you okay?
you can do it. We can do it.
go!
get up!
stop, Mark! Come back!
keep walking, doll, okay?
and go!
great, great!
Yeah, yeah, Tony!
Oh, perfect, yay!
jump and jump!
go, Tony! Good!
yay, Tony!
they're swinging poles.
okay? On my count.
one, two, three!
are you okay?
Tony, are you okay?
I said, you know, with a slight hesitation, not the full body blow.
booth, the victim was hit from both directions at the same time.
I think this could be the murder scene.
great. A little help here, Roxie, huh?
get me up!
come on, this is... I got it.
geez, just roll it over.
I'm trying, Tony.
just roll it over like a manicotti.
feel the stuffed shell, baby.
that's it.
that's right. - FBI.
and I am also a very well-respected forensic anthropologist who convinced you I was Roxie because of my superb acting skills.
that's enough, Bones.
you have no jurisdiction here.
okay, was that your big plan, huh, pal?
kill anyone you want because we have no jurisdiction?
kill? What are you talking about?
Adam Pak was killed here.
I didn't do it.
I'm a healer, not a killer.
a healer? You're Jeremy Brewster.
and you have a record.
okay, I'm sort of a fraud.
but I've read all the self-help books.
I give them what they need.
my clients, they get their money's worth.
well, maybe Adam found out who you really were.
that gives you great motive to keep him quiet.
the evidence suggests he was killed on your obstacle course.
you know, I don't have to talk to you.
no, you don't have to say a word.
as long as you don't leave this land.
but the second you step off, you're all ours.
okay, okay.
Adam and Kelly, they were both insane.
he confessed to me that he was married.
made me promise not to tell anyone.
then Kelly started coming on to me to make Adam jealous.
they need real help.
I could only imagine what would happen if his wife found out.
we're gonna keep an eye on you, Jeremy.
please don't tell them about me.
I've got a good business going here... honest.
it's stuck, Booth.
all right, you got to get me out of this.
I'm a ball of sweat in here.
Oh, you didn't have to do this, Arastoo.
it's nothing... I stole it.
that way if you go to prison, we can share a cell.
Hodgins' lawyer said I have to hire a forensic accountant to dig through all the fraudulent records.
this could take months.
my salary's gonna have to go into an escrow account.
what happened to "innocent until proven guilty"?
I feel like I'm back in Iran.
so, based on the data and the photos from Brennan and Booth, there is no way that the gauntlet is the murder weapon.
there isn't enough speed behind the pendulum swing and the fracture patterns don't match.
of course, why did I expect good news?
good news!
okay, don't play with me, Dr. Hodgins.
the results on the wood splinter from the victim's teeth are in.
it's oak.
same splinters they found on his clothes.
Yes, but there are traces of sap still present in these.
is that important?
well, it means that the sliver's from a living tree.
now, check this out.
these are oak trees in the southeast corner of the reservation.
right at the edge of the New Dawn Retreat property.
Yeah, now that whitish gray substance on the overgrown grass, that is agricultural lime.
Adam Pak died in this part of the reservation.
this is the murder scene.
this tree has sustained significant damage to its bark.
look, Booth, these are teeth. This is the murder weapon.
Oh, ho, ho, ho, wait a second here.
look at this, huh?
keys, yeah, these could be the victim's or the killer's.
even with skeletal fluorosis, Adam's injuries are not consistent with just running into a tree.
something propelled him into the tree with great force.
Yeah, like a car?
I mean, come on, look at these.
is it a coincidence that these tire tracks go right up to the murder tree?
Oh, look at this, huh?
driveway gravel.
you seem awfully sure. - Yeah, and it's red, too, okay?
it's the same red driveway gravel that I saw at Emma Pak's house.
I'm bringing her in.
the tree is a match and so are the teeth.
Yeah, I heard.
are you okay?
I just got another letter from a collection agency.
this one says I owe $36, 000.
whoever's using my name has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars.
you knew there'd be more.
cam... - She's ruined my good name.
no, not... not here.
let's make an exception.
I grew up in the South Bronx.
I've been working since I was 11 years old.
I know.
valedictorian in my high school, full academic scholarship through med school,
I interned at two of the best hospitals in the country.
I know your story.
I was the youngest coroner in New York City.
and now... - You're here.
running the most respected lab in the country.
and somebody has stolen that from me.
no. - Yes!
stolen everything I have worked my whole life for.
not even close. - I am this far away from debtor's prison.
they don't have that anymore.
I might lose my house.
all of that is true... but none of it is really you.
you're just saying that because you love me.
I do.
I don't know what else you want me to say.
look, I-I didn't know he was cheating on me, I swear.
we got a dead body, okay?
and your driveway gravel puts you at the scene of the crime.
that's impossible. I never left my house.
look, ask the security company.
my guess is you called security to give yourself an alibi that night.
who thinks like that? - Murderers.
that's who thinks like that. Murderers.
you didn't learn anything about your relationship with Booth?
I wasn't there with Booth.
Roxie was there with Tony.
okay.
did Roxie learn anything about her relationship with Tony?
shaman Little River is a fraud, Angela.
he has no wisdom to impart.
you, a trained anthropologist, immersed yourself in a specific culture and you learned nothing?
I did realize that, compared to others,
booth and I have a very good relationship.
so you learned nothing.
there's something embedded... - What is that?
inorganic.
given the location, it could be from the car that hit Adam Pak from behind and propelled him into the tree.
you manipulated me into answering that question by exploiting my professional ego.
God, the old Brennan never would've seen that.
Oh, gotta run.
okay, here you go.
uh, digital and hard copies.
what's this?
well, I figure why pay a forensic accountant when you've got me?
I don't believe it.
and I don't bill by the hour, so I won't waste your time.
Wh... Angela, you're too busy.
I didn't want you to do this.
Yeah, I know.
because you're insane.
you've got friends here, Cam.
people who love you.
Arastoo... It's not a burden for any of us to help you.
it's time you start accepting that.
I just didn't want people to... - Yeah, we don't need to hear the reasons.
okay, so... these are all the fraudulent accounts that have been opened or used in your name within the last 90 days.
I mean, it's just a start, but it's something.
how did you...?
I looked in a few places I wasn't supposed to be looking.
I won't get into the details.
I just thought, since you were the good guy...
Oh, don't cry. - No, I won't.
thank you.
the particulate you found was a chrome alloy.
from a car?
I can be even more specific.
you see, over the last 50 years, right, the auto industry has changed the chrome alloy composition it uses on cars.
the composition of the particulate from the victim proves that the car that hit Adam Pak was manufactured prior to the 1970s.
so, a vintage car.
give me some time, I can track down the make.
you can have all the time you want, but I think I might know.
the Schumachers drive a 1965 van.
the Schumachers?
I did not see that coming. - Should've known.
Why? - Why? Because they're like the world's greatest couple.
I mean, what were they doing at that couples' retreat?
I'm the shrink! I should have thought of that.
okay, what did you find out?
well, the Schumachers went to four different couples' retreats where one of the other guests said that their place was broken into.
see? That's good information.
come on, it's not psychological insight.
it's just... checking records.
it's not my job. - Look, the Schumachers... you know what?
they know their victims, okay?
they steal their keys and they break into their houses.
so it was the Schumachers that Emma Pak heard at the house that night.
they got the key, they showed up at the house to rob it 'cause they thought Kelly was the wife, right?
boom!
I left a letter on your desk.
no, no.
I have some leave I haven't taken.
what do you mean, leave?
it'll be like a vacation.
I... some time.
just to clear my head.
no, I don't like this.
I need time.
okay. Time.
thank you.
we found blood in the back of your van.
well, yeah, that's from his head, where Evelyn smacked him.
Yeah, after he attacked Bill.
Yeah, after he had slapped Evelyn when he caught her returning his house key to the tent.
and Bill karate-chopped him in the throat.
Yeah.
right... What... what did you smack him with?
okay, you carry this around with you?
an old lady alone in the world?
I call that my equalizer.
you know, we thought Pak was dead.
bundled him into the van and looked to dump him somewhere.
Yeah, but he woke up and tried to make a run for it.
so you ran him over.
God, this... this guy knows everything, doesn't he?
your mother must be so proud.
okay, a little word of advice:
when you go to the courts, you know, try to look... sorry, you know?
it helps.
well, that's gonna be hard.
I mean, the man brought his mistress to a married couples' retreat.
no one's gonna cry for him.
marriage means something.
now... are you really married to that sweetheart you brought to the retreat, huh?
okay, what if I say "no"? You gonna hit me over the head and run me over?
no.
it's obvious you love her.
Yeah, the way she looked at you... you can't fake that. No, no.
marry her, big boy. - Oh, come on, look...
I am not gonna take some advice from a couple of house-robbing murderers.
then take advice from a couple who've loved each other for 38 years.
Oh, hey... we're gonna be able to bunk together in prison, right?
Oh, of course, pet.
they can't break us up.
you know that.
you didn't tell the Schumachers that they'd be separated in prison?
well, you know, I didn't have the heart to do that, I just...
all right, Bones, why are we doing this? The guy was a fraud.
although I don't believe in the shaman's "fluctuating fields of force" exercise,
I do believe in biological electrical impulses.
okay, come on, let's hurry up, let's get this done, I got a game to watch.
booth... - What?
come on. - All right.
only our palms touch, nothing else.
just let your mind drift.
sweets is, um, taking a leave of absence.
to do what?
well, he said that he, uh, lost touch with his original motivation for being a psychologist.
well, I thought he was a psychologist because he had substandard math skills.
okay, are we done here or...?
No! No. Booth, come on.
all right. I'm right here.
I'm right here.
did Bill and Evelyn remind you of us?
well, if somebody was choking me, would you hit them over the head with a billiard ball?
Yes.
if someone slapped me, would you karate chop them in the throat?
Yeah, I would.
booth, we are only supposed to touch the palms of our hands.
I can't help it. I... - ...nothing else.
I'm just drifting.
I'm drifting with the whole... electronical device thing.
electrical impulses.
there's a hacker named Christopher Pelant.
where are you?
pretty much anywhere I want to be.
this guy's killed how many people? - Eight.
this guy is worse than anyone you and I have ever come across.
and he told you that if you married Temperance, that he would choose five random human beings and kill them?
not only if I married Bones but if I told her why we couldn't get married.
what kind of flower is that?
it's a marigold.
what's that mean? - Pain and grief.
christopher Pelant, you are under arrest.
we have nothing on him. - So Pelant wins?
Yes, today Pelant wins.
down!
been looking for this guy for three months, and I got nothing.
it's a complete dead end.
Pelant's laughing at us right now.
the key will be to tie Pelant to the murders specifically.
Pelant is still out there.
we're still waiting for him to make the next move.
Hey, I-I love the closeness, sweetie, but isn't there something else you could be doing?
just want to make sure the shield works.
Yeah, well, I've set up a trident sub's worth of microwave-emitting jammers.
there is no way that Pelant is hacking through this thing.
Hey, Sweets, what are you doing here? Thought you were on leave.
well, this whole idea started with me.
Pelant thinks he's smarter than all of us, which might be true, but he's not smarter than all of us put together.
Hey, is this the guy?
Yes.
late 30s, excellent dentition, good tone.
his name was Donald Hestnes.
Yeah, what happened to him?
coronary occlusion.
fortunately he had willed his body to the Jeffersonian.
somehow I don't think this is quite what he had in mind.
do you object to our plan, Ms. Julian?
legally it passes muster, as the deceased donated his body to science.
that being said, what you're doing gives me the chills.
the situation necessitates it.
Pelant's fundamental personality structure is psychopathic with extreme narcissism that demands an audience.
less shrinky, cher.
he won't be able to tolerate someone else stealing his spotlight.
we're going to smoke him out.
I, uh, conceptualized a copycat body drop.
Pelant usually goes for the baroque, so I modeled it after a painting by Salvator Rosa.
the punishment of Prometheus.
he was bound to a rock and his liver was torn out by a giant eagle.
that body may not be sufficiently degraded for us to get the call.
I already took care of that.
Aw, Angie, that is brilliant.
Yeah, I kind of hate it.
we'd better get to it.
this is excellent work, very thorough.
lovely.
makes me want to poke my eyes out.
you may hate it, but it is amazing.
let's hope it worth it.
nobody followed you? - No, don't worry.
I doubled back, like, five times to make sure no one tailed me.
where do I deliver the body?
back entrance to the Jackson, uh, Arboretum, all right?
there's no night security there since the sequester.
what's my window?
five hours all in.
I know you don't like this idea. - Yeah.
you've been hunting Pelant for months on your own.
Yeah, and I've gotten nowhere, so I got to try something new here.
but you don't like it.
Yeah, I don't like it.
Pelant put me behind a desk for the rest of my career.
I appreciate you giving me this chance to catch the bastard.
wow, that's... wow.
it was actually a fascinating exercise.
do you know this is the first time I've burned a human bone?
not the right tone, Bones.
Oh, yeah.
so, the body has to be displayed on this big boulder at the entrance to the fern grotto.
according to the myth, Prometheus' torment began each day with the rising sun, so the skull needs to face the east.
you got it.
presentation is vital. Deviate even slightly, and Pelant will know we're setting him up.
all right. Well, I'm not about to argue with a woman who can solve a murder using only a tooth and a magnifying glass.
I have solved a murder using only a tooth, but I used significantly more sophisticated equipment than a magnifying glass.
I'll do it exactly the way you said.
well, Flynn's motivated, he'll get it done.
five hours, Flynn.
I won't forget this, Booth.
you're doing me a big favor.
do you wish you were going with him?
I wish I'd killed Pelant three months ago.
it'd be better to catch him alive.
better for who?
I wish the call would come in.
we could have sex.
well, our bodies need to relieve tension so we can sleep.
Oh, way to take the romance out of it.
well, I'm just being practical.
I just know I always sleep best after several orgasms.
okay, what, is that some kind of a challenge?
maybe.
Flynn? - No, FBI.
they found the body.
okay, so what do we got?
the remains were found by a dog walker one hour ago.
she called it in to Metro.
poor woman will have nightmares for the rest of her life.
well, we can't fake everything. Time of death?
blowfly larvae indicate ten hours ago.
the extent of the evisceration and the manner in which the body is bound indicate a retelling of the Prometh...
Oh, God.
a flower.
it's not us?
Oh, no.
Hodgins, do you know?
Yeah, it's, it's a monkshood.
means "A foe is near."
this is a message from Pelant.
he's telling us we didn't fool him.
it's worse than that.
what? - This isn't our body.
what? - Are you sure?
this victim has remodeled fractures on the third and fourth left ribs and both clavicles.
come on, come on, come on.
this remodeling wasn't in our corpse.
it suggests bullet wounds that are less than a year old.
it's Flynn. - Well, how do you know?
he took those bullets for me. I know those wounds.
Hi, this is Flynn. If you're listening to this instead of talking to me,
I must have a really good reason.
visual inspection of the mandibular offset, in conjunction with the angle of the zygomatic and the already noted remodeled bullet wounds, indicates...
that Booth was correct and this is Hayes Flynn.
Oh, my God.
you all right?
there are no defensive wounds.
Pelant has used injectable anesthetic to immobilize victims in the past.
well, I'll, uh, run a tox screen to confirm.
kerf marks on the sternum congruent with a manual bone saw.
striae indicate 32 passes were made.
32 passes... is that one of Pelant's ticks?
no, it's one of mine.
he mirrored my technique.
Why?
be-because he's trying to get under your skin.
I'll swab for particulates.
Pelant does not leave particulates.
well, someday he'll make a mistake.
I just hope I'm the one that catches it.
Oh, God.
there are clamp marks on the hepatic artery.
what, what does that mean?
what does that mean?
tell me.
my guess... it was so he could keep Flynn alive while he removed his liver.
like Prometheus.
he's telling us that this is our fault.
but it's not. - We were trying to piss him off.
well, we succeeded, and we got Flynn killed.
we did not kill Hayes Flynn; Pelant did.
now, the only thing we can do is try to catch Pelant, using the evidence in front of us.
well, what if we don't?
what if this just goes on forever?
it won't. In fact, I almost feel sorry for Pelant.
what?
he killed someone who saved Booth's life.
cam's right; Booth will never give up.
look, I don't need that right now, okay, Aldo?
I have more important stuff to deal with, you understand?
I'm a bartender, not a priest.
you want to talk, you got to buy a drink.
fine. Here.
there's your money.
it's not your fault the guy died.
look, I went along with the plan.
I didn't like the plan but I went along with it, and a good guy died from it.
I absolve you of your sin.
you think this was my fault?
I do not, but you do.
now, how did psycho killer find out?
I don't know. I mean, we thought that he couldn't hear us or see us, but obviously we were wrong.
or somebody told him.
not me, because I didn't know about it.
so who does that leave?
people I trust with my life.
and maybe the guy who got killed?
okay, let's take this place apart, all right?
Pelant had eyes on Flynn... we're not leaving until we find them.
booth, I know you didn't like the plan, and since it was my plan...
you know what, Sweets? It was a good plan, okay?
what went wrong after was not your fault.
thank you.
so, how do you think Pelant found out?
like he always does... he hacked a phone or planted a bug.
I had another idea.
what's that?
that's not possible.
all right. Have you been here before?
Yeah, a couple times.
and does anything look different?
not really. Ever since his divorce, he didn't really care much about stuff.
it looks like he was trying to come to grips with something.
look, Sweets, Flynn was a hero who got shot to pieces, okay?
he's lucky that he survived. They put him behind his desk to end his career...
so yeah, he was coming to grips with stuff.
check out all the power sources, okay?
and look for any kind of transmitter.
and what if there isn't any, Booth?
will you suspect Flynn then? - No, I won't, Sweets.
I'll just figure that Pelant got here before us and he removed it, okay?
so take a look around, and if you see anything strange or out of the ordinary, just tell me.
I looked at the swabs from Flynn's body with polarized light microscopy, energy-dispersive X-rays and mass spectrometer.
I found a few spores from the arboretum, but that would be just plain weird not to.
I got nothing that points us anywhere else.
Pelant isn't working from the arboretum.
no, no. I-It's too public, you know?
he needs privacy.
the absence of evidence is in itself evidence.
that's right. Yeah, as well as privacy,
Pelant needs a sterile environment with air filtration, a power supply, soundproofing.
you know, Angela can map up a... a radius... Cool, great.
we're gonna get right on that.
what is that?
Flynn's clavicle was fractured by a bullet, surgically repaired, then a pin was inserted after it started to set.
isn't that standard?
if the pin is made from steel or titanium.
this pin is made from artificial bone, an extremely expensive procedure.
I don't see how Hayes Flynn could afford this.
okay, look, Flynn had some, uh, expensive surgery done after the shooting.
how expensive? - Too expensive for him.
even if he lived like this to save money?
we're talking about, like, rich-aunt money...
he didn't have a rich aunt.
so, did you get anything off the books?
all in all, they are appropriate to someone whose life has been changed by a huge trauma.
obviously, forgiveness... is something that he was struggling with.
you think maybe Pelant paid for his surgery?
sweets... - Booth, just hear me out.
what if Flynn's forgiveness obsession was actually an effort to come to grips with Pelant helping him?
did you come up with anything useful?
no. - You need to see this.
agent Booth?
fake passports, credit cards, cash.
Yeah, Sweets, I get it.
that's getaway stash.
look, how do we know that Pelant didn't set up Flynn?
it's called "preponderance of evidence," cher.
expensive surgery, wads of cash...
you know what, he manipulates evidence all the time, okay?
look what he did to you, Caroline.
right? A-And he set Bones up.
Digitally... in the virtual world.
he moves around bits and bytes; that's his thing.
this is real money, paper, things.
I don't believe it.
if Flynn were still alive, I'd have to send you out to arrest him.
right, and I wouldn't do it.
you're that sure?
really, just think about it, okay?
think, right? We keep finding this evidence because Pelant wants us to.
you know what would make me suspicious?
if we didn't find any evidence, okay?
that proves to me that Flynn was clean.
look at this, huh? Bones just found the doctor that did Flynn's surgery.
now we'll get the truth.
I hope so.
you implant micropor ceramic pins into complex fractures.
it's a highly experimental procedure, and you are the only surgeon on the East Coast capable of doing it.
that is correct.
you operated on this man.
what you don't want to do right now is pull some doctor-patient crap, 'cause this man was murdered.
Flynn. FBI agent.
Yes, I performed the procedure on him.
how'd he pay for it?
anonymous donation to my research foundation.
from whom? - I can't tell you that.
can't tell me? You son of a... - Booth!
this anonymous donor not only murdered Flynn, but he's using you to make him look corrupt.
booth, Booth, please, let go.
I'm sorry.
no, I'm sorry.
what I should have said was, I can't tell you because when we looked for the source of the money, we couldn't find it.
shell companies? - Yes.
the money was going to aid an FBI agent who was severely wounded in the line of duty.
our ethics committee found no reason to refuse the money.
agent Flynn... did he know?
I'm sorry, I have no idea what Agent Flynn did or did not know.
he was sedated for quite a while.
agent Flynn should have died, and he would have if it weren't for me.
and this anonymous donor?
booth, the doctor did an incredible job repairing 11 fractures from bullet wounds in such a short period of time.
ten. There were ten fractures.
but I found 11 remodeled fractures.
I'm telling you, there were only ten... your memory is playing tricks on you.
that's not possible.
it simply isn't.
Pelant paid that surgeon to save Flynn's life.
well, it doesn't mean that Flynn, you know, knew.
I think Pelant is framing Flynn. - Why?
because it's what you believe.
whoa, wait a second, Bones, th... that is not rational.
certainly it is. You told that doctor that I couldn't possibly be wrong about the number of remodeled fractures I found. Why?
Why? Because all the time we've been working together, you have never been wrong about something like that.
it is not possible that you are wrong about Flynn, so I'm being completely rational.
we a-agreed to avoid public displays of affection at the FBI.
the hell with the FBI.
I have to go... do scientific things to catch a serial killer.
right.
sibley Memorial made these X rays the day Flynn was shot.
you'll notice there are ten fractures, all caused by high-velocity bullets.
those must be the ones that Dr. Itzkowitz fixed. He was telling the truth.
and these are our intake X rays of Flynn's body.
the hospital's X rays show only ten fractures, but our X rays show 11.
the damage to Agent Flynn's left humerus is not a true fracture.
what is it?
it's likely Pelant used an etching tool to simulate the break and digital lithography for the remodeling.
the craftsmanship is... really astounding.
are you complimenting Pelant?
well, his skill, his intelligence.
his abilities are awe-inspiring.
I've seen this one before.
this is identical to a fractured bone from a homicide I worked on nine years ago.
one of Pelant's?
I don't know. It's still unsolved.
Pelant is sending me a message.
Oh, here we go, down the rabbit hole.
identical.
Hello, Temperance.
let's talk.
if that goes off, it'll kill you, too.
you and I are destined to die together someday.
hope not today, but... but that's up to you.
I-I'm just... I'm gonna remind you that you're a mother, so self-sacrifice isn't the best option.
Plus, whoever is right above us will also die.
that's a public area.
is it?
what-what do you think happened to poor Chloe Campbell?
I think you killed her. - No. Wasn't me.
you know who did it?
same person who did 1870, 3606, 4005, 7932 and 9224.
no, that's not possible. I wouldn't have missed that.
don't be so hard on yourself.
they were found in different geographical locations, killed by completely different methods, different ages.
nothing to connect them. And yet... they were all killed by one person.
who?
I don't know.
yet. But... because I'm better than you and all your squinters,
I will figure out who the killer is.
I think, um... I think she's pretty bad, and I think she's still out there.
she?
well, I'm-I'm being sloppily generic, but...
I have my reasons for thinking it's a woman.
and if anything happens to me, sh-she'll keep doing what she's doing and you won't even know she's there.
I know you. You'll find me.
it's in the stars.
Yeah, um, don't move until that beam goes off.
think about all the innocent lives you're saving by-by doing absolutely nothing.
I scanned the currency you found in the apartment.
Flynn's money was all new bills. - Wait, not Flynn's money.
okay, fine.
the money you found hidden in his fridge.
the bills with serial numbers on either side of the money you found are circulating in central Maryland.
there's just too many there for it to be a coincidence.
each of these pins represents a place where the money was spent.
by Pelant.
Yeah, he works alone.
it's got to be him.
that's still a few hundred square miles.
wait, where's Bones?
I don't... I don't know.
bones. - Don't come in, Booth.
what's going on? - There's an explosive device.
we've called the bomb squad.
you all right, Bones? - It was Pelant.
he says if I move, the bomb will go off.
it's not real.
you can clear out.
booth? - Yeah.
it's not that I doubt you.
I'm just curious how you know it's not real.
it's a toy. Okay?
you can order this thing from the back of a comic book.
you know, we can wait for the bomb squad, but you're gonna be standing there for five hours.
I'm fine.
see?
fake. All right?
so... what did Pelant say to you?
that there's a serial killer out there and that we'll never catch her without him.
do you believe him?
I haven't looked into it yet.
you know what? I think we're getting close.
Pelant knows it and he's afraid.
because you are gonna kill him.
you're looking for something you might have missed?
I can't find anything that connects these cases.
Pelant could be lying.
he's never lied to me.
well, this could be his way of distracting you from what's really important right now.
or it's a clue.
Dr. Brennan, I need your focus for a moment. Were all Flynn's teeth intact?
Yes. All teeth are present, except the third bicuspid is chipped.
I think I found your missing piece.
where did you find this?
in his stomach.
Pelant may not have had the opportunity to sterilize it as he did the rest of Flynn's bones.
Hodgins should swab this for particulates.
the last time I saw Agent Flynn,
I boasted that I once solved a murder using only a tooth.
okay.
Dr. Brennan, do you really think it's possible that Pelant could find a link between these cases that you missed?
something I've learned from Booth is to question myself.
you've known Booth longer than I have.
do you think he'll kill Pelant the next time he has the chance?
usually I'd say no, but... the way Booth's turning Flynn into a saint, feels like he's working himself up for something.
but Booth's a complex man.
I'm not sure any of us can tell what he's really thinking deep down.
call me if Hodgins gets any information from the tooth.
is it okay if I don't have a drink?
no. You people are killing me here.
this is a business.
not a very good business.
because people don't buy drinks.
okay, what if I buy a drink but don't drink it?
that works for me.
booth wants to kill Pelant. Which is fine.
he's a very bad man. He's murdered... we don't know how many people.
what if there's someone worse and we need Pelant to catch that killer?
Oh, God.
it's these ethical dilemmas that drove me out of the priesthood.
I need to know what Booth is going to do.
so you can protect Pelant?
he's more valuable alive than dead. That's all.
it depends which Booth is there.
Seeley Booth, the one I love.
no, I mean, like all of us, he has two sides to him.
he has one side that wants to save the world and one side that wants to take care of the people he loves.
those two collide, well, that's what you call a tortured soul.
there's no such thing as a soul.
says you.
but Booth values nothing higher than his soul. Yet...
he's willing to sacrifice his soul by killing Pelant.
Why?
for you, of course.
it's always gonna come down to you.
how's your work going, Dr. Brennan?
Pelant has left me a puzzle.
I just don't know what the solution is.
maybe there isn't one. He could just be using these bones to distract you.
Pelant doesn't distract. He leaves clues.
the key to finding him must be in these bones.
even if these are all the victims of one killer, they still have nothing to do with Pelant.
let's go after one murderer at a time.
these are the wrong bones.
that's what I've been trying to tell you.
Pelant switched the bones in all of the drawers he directed me to.
these aren't the bones that belong in drawer 1870.
they originate from drawer 1452.
except for Chloe Campbell, none of the remains are in the correct drawers.
why would Pelant switch remains from one drawer to another?
it's another code.
he's sending me a message.
all right, you're gonna yell at me, but this is my job and I'm gonna risk it.
what? Are you gonna say that you found something that indicates that Flynn was Freudian delusional with synergistic narcissism disorder, huh?
what? I don't... That's not a thing.
I'm here about Pelant.
okay.
I believe he's trying to seduce Dr. Brennan.
what? With this whole nonexistent serial killer thing?
no. Yes, but mostly no.
I'm saying in a more profound way.
bones hates Pelant.
exactly. Pelant is using my research against you and Dr. Brennan.
and the lesson that he's taken from that is that Dr. Brennan changes her mind about people.
okay, what people?
after your first case together, she detested you.
and she hated me at first, too. Right?
you know what? She never hated you.
she just didn't believe in the stuff that you were saying. That's all.
right. But now we're very close.
Pelant truly believes that he can make Dr. Brennan see him in a new light.
the-the same way that you did.
you got to be kidding me. That's crazy. - Pelant's crazy.
what does... what does all this mean, Sweets? Spell it out.
well, Dr. Brennan is Pelant's endgame.
he's trying to replace you.
has he done anything to prevent the two of you from getting together that we don't know about?
I'll take that as a yes.
does this mean he won't hurt Bones?
up until the moment he discovers that she'll never have him, yeah.
then what happens?
then he kills her, he kills himself and anyone else nearby.
you sure we're safe to work in here?
I've tripled my firewalls just to be sure.
security has no idea how Pelant got in the building.
I pulled the closed circuit files to see if I could find anything they missed.
let me guess, they were all corrupted.
completely.
Pelant only lets us find what he wants us to find.
I swabbed the tooth you pulled out of Flynn's stomach.
please tell me you found something.
I found a whole lot of minerally goodness.
look at this: iron oxide, sulfur, uranium, thorium, calcium, potassium, a smidgen of silicon dioxide.
let me rephrase. Please tell me you found one thing I can use.
all of this is one thing: it's bituminous coal ash.
so Flynn was in the proximity of a coal-burning fire when his tooth was chipped?
who burns coal anymore?
old foundries or power plants. I mean, their furnaces, they would definitely have this kind of mix of compounds.
we know Pelant is working out of central Maryland.
okay. All right. Well, then see what you can find in that radius.
okay, there's this.
the Keeler Power Plant. They shut down operations ten years ago.
an abandoned power plant.
Yeah, that would give Pelant isolation, scale, a power supply.
Hey, this is the perfect infrastructure to work from.
I'll call Booth.
what's this? - What's this?
we found Pelant. I'm going after him.
Yes, with a SWAT team.
no, he's not gonna let that happen, you understand me?
this is between me, him, and Bones.
what makes you think Pelant didn't put that tooth in Flynn's stomach himself to lure you out there?
because I know Flynn, all right?
he chipped his own tooth and swallowed it so we could find it.
you must be pretty damn sure Hayes Flynn was the man you think he is.
I'd bet my life on it.
the Keeler Power Plant is 23 miles away.
booth is gonna need a schematic.
all right, I'll send this to his phone.
Pelant will have eyes and ears all over this place.
I mean, he's gonna pick up the signals.
I'm frequency-hopping. We have at least 15 minutes before he suspects anything.
unless he set it all up.
I'm inventorying all the security feeds in the area.
is that Booth?
Oh, man. He's way too early.
that's Brennan's car.
how the hell did Brennan know where to go?
hold on, hold on.
damn it.
Oh, my Lord.
can you pick up her visual on another feed?
I don't have anything from inside the plant.
how did she find him?
I was looking at these old cold cases, and these are her notes.
I mean, there isn't much. It's a list of cities.
damascus, Germantown, Aspen Hill in Maryland.
Woodstock and Sterling in Virginia and Washington, D.C.
these cities all correspond to the original victims from the bone drawers Pelant named.
how did this lead Brennan to the power plant?
I don't know.
she also wrote down this word "Aquila."
what does that mean?
okay, Aquila.
uh, Latin for "eagle.
game reserve, Italian aircraft carrier, constellation.
constellation. It's the name of the bird that devoured Prometheus' liver.
lay the constellation over the map.
six of these stars line up, and the seventh star... - Altair. This is it.
this is the brightest one, and that's where Pelant is.
that son of a bitch wrote her a love note that only she could understand.
welcome.
turn left and walk straight until I tell you to stop.
there's Booth. Can you open the gate?
I'm trying, but Pelant's got me blocked out.
can't you do something?
I'm here.
so am I.
nice to see you.
temperance, you look beautiful.
how much time do you think we have before Booth gets here?
I'm alone.
Yeah, but that never lasts for very long, does it?
if you surrender to me, Booth won't kill you.
and if I don't, you'll shoot me?
there's only one rational choice.
good.
but you know Booth.
very sneaky, very stealthy, sniper at heart.
it'll take him forever to get inside.
if I try to run away, where will you shoot me?
in the head.
never the head.
that's the part of me you like best.
the mysterious serial killer... are you curious why I think it's a woman?
no, but I do want to know if Hayes Flynn was working with you.
not wittingly.
I mean, he didn't know about the money in his fridge or the bug in his car.
please drop the gun.
what?
Oh, God.
something exploded.
Hey, can you hear me? I-I... I tried to shape the blast so that it wouldn't deafen you, but, you know, no-nobody's perfect.
here, come here. Hey.
I'm always ahead of you people.
I-I... I know how you work.
you let me lead you into this trap, and Booth is still circling the building looking for a way in.
looks like I came full circle.
you okay, Bones? - I'm okay.
surprise! The next explosion will level the entire building.
Dr. Brennan, tell Booth to leave now, or I will blow us all up.
he's bluffing. It's a toy just like the last time.
I'm not gonna take that risk.
do you see, Booth? She's willing to risk your life to keep me alive.
what does that tell you?
you put it down, or I'm gonna kill you.
shoot him, Booth. - What?
I'm not willing to risk your life to keep Pelant alive.
not for one second. Shoot him!
time's up.
you okay?
don't worry. It's okay.
he's dead.
he is dead?
I'm sorry. - Well, you know, you should be sorry.
I did want him alive, and I was pretty sure that you'd kill him if you could.
well, you know what? You weren't wrong.
I did kill him.
you gave him a chance.
you're a very good man.
I'm in to Pelant's security system.
that's them.
Oh, thank God.
look, we got to make a deal, and this deal has got to stick, all right?
from now on, I will do all the fighting and the shooting and the apprehending of killers, okay?
you can do all the smart stuff, right?
you can stay in the lab and play with your bones and all that good stuff.
you know, I don't come into your lab there and play with your telescopes and stuff like that.
I don't have a telescope.
what's wrong?
are they both all right?
looks like it.
why'd they stop?
look, the main reason that I, um... wanted to kill Pelant was because, um, he kept me from marrying you.
I thought it was something like that.
look, and if I told you why we couldn't get married, he was gonna kill innocent people.
you made the right choice.
it's all right.
if I ask you to marry me, will you say yes?
if I say yes, will we get married?
Yes.
was that what it looked like?
looks like a proposal.
I feel like we missed a whole bunch.
who cares? We were here for the big happy ending.
Oh, we're not. Not till we make all the plans, okay?
all right.
Oh, this guy is all chewed up.
torn, actually. Missing phalanges, bone fragments from the skull.
probably a hawk fed on him.
don't you want to discuss it with our friends, Booth?
Oh, really? I mean, you really want to get everyone's opinion on what they think our wedding should be like?
what, You can't have pigs in a blanket, huh?
no, no, you know what, you should have radishes that are shaped like hummingbirds and wear dandelion hats.
I've never even seen those things.
they exist.
based on decomp, I'd estimate he's been here for approximately three days.
but Cam should probably make that determination.
we can wait for her to get a definitive...
no, no, no. We're not...
I've been dangling here for long enough, all right?
things are... you know, they're starting to pinch.
listen, Bones, all I'm saying, that this is...
look, we've been waiting a long time for this day, for our wedding, all right?
I just want this to be our day. Don't you?
but we'll invite everybody, won't we?
of course. Of course we are.
you always say that you know best.
based on the palatine suture, the width of the ascending ramus and the sternal rib ends, the victim was a Caucasian male in his early 50s.
I do dislike it when other people tell me what to do.
see? Now there's the Bones that I love, all right?
we're gonna have a great wedding.
Whoo... all right.
Aw... That's right. Or whatever it's gonna be.
okay. But... pigs in a blanket?
Yeah. Pigs in a blanket. It's God's perfect food.
that might be a point of contention.
come on.
this looks like an accident.
Oh, no. No one out of shape in their 50s, goes rock climbing alone.
this was a murder.
you're making an assumption, Booth.
what? Well, I'm that guy. I'm that gut guy, okay?
I assume things. That's what I do.
Whoa!
then I'm going to need to take the hawk back to the lab, too.
is he eating a finger?
Yes. He seems to be enjoying it.
we'll need Animal Control.
no, we need to get pulled up.
can we get the hawk?
trust me, you're gonna like pigs in a blanket.
so I'm compiling character traits of rock climbers and their psychosocial...
great.
you don't want to hear?
Oh, I get it. Psycho socials
they're like dances, uh, you know, in a loony bin.
I got it, right? Come on in.
shut the door, will you?
just... will you shut the door for a second?
what's going on?
Thanks. I just want to... want you to...
just keep an open mind about something here.
about what? Is this about the wedding?
cause if you want to parachute from a plane or something. - No.
I'm down. I'll do it.
no one's parachuting from a-a plane.
thank God. You know, I actually have an awesome idea for a wedding.
sweets. It's not about, um, the wedding.
it's about VAL. - Who's that?
no. No. No. Because my last blind date was a disaster, all right?
she threw her drink my face because she didn't know what masticate meant.
this isn't a... - It means to chew.
sweets, just pay attention, okay?
I'd like to introduce you to... ...VAL.
okay? It's a Virtual something... - Adumbrative.
Yes! That's the word.
it's an artificial profiling system.
right. You know... So everything I get from the case,
I got to input it into here and so do the squints, so...
Wow. They want to compare me to a computer.
I can't be replaced by a video game.
listen, I had to... I just felt like I had to tell you.
right? Because you're... you know... so I did.
but if you tell anyone, I'm gonna have to kill you.
no, I understand. This is not a problem, it's... it's a joke, is what...
I-I agree. It's a complete joke. - Yeah.
to me, it's like that Russian guy who played the computer in chess.
it doesn't work. - Exactly.
kasparov lost to the computer, but...
it's not a... it's not a good comparison.
what a beautiful bird.
I know, right? And look how much he's regurgitated.
excuse me?
Yeah. See, hawks, they don't have teeth, right?
so they got to tear and swallow clothes, flesh and bone whole, and then they regurgitate what they can't, you know, digest.
this guy is full of evidence. I mean, look at this.
honey, when you're showing me puke, don't smile like that.
it's called rangle. See, when the stomach contents come up, they're this hard, congealed...
okay. I get it. I'm starting to feel like I'm gonna rangle.
come on, buddy.
have you examined these X-rays, Dr. Wells?
of course. I took them.
lack of extensions along the edges of the phalanges where the flexor sheath attaches and an absence of remodeled stress or other fractures in the wrists and metacarpals indicate someone who has not been rock climbing before.
you shouldn't be reading, Dr. Wells.
I'm sorry. Was I wrong?
that's beside the point. You're here to work, not read.
based on decomp and the desiccation of the tissue,
I'd estimate time of death at...
three days.
excuse me? - Three days.
I factored in ambient temperature at the scene, rainfall, the feeding of the carrion...
I-I'm sorry, but if you were gonna say anything other than three days, you'd be wrong. Now, can I just finish my page?
no.
Oh, my God.
why am I never prepared for what I see here?
alfred Adler would say that a repression of visual stimuli...
why is he back?
he's brilliant.
is that why he's reading Mindy Kaling's book?
I'm a polymath. I can learn from anything.
how long will it take you to do a facial reconstruction?
uh, damaged skull and the dried tissue...
the sooner the better, really, because this dude was definitely murdered.
I think it's a little bit early to make that statement, Dr. Wells.
perhaps not.
the facial injuries indicate that the victim struck the cliff face first.
as if he were thrown off the edge of the cliff, as Booth assumed.
well, then there's also hemorrhagic staining to the wound around the parietal, which means it occurred perimortem.
so the wound to the parietal was cause of death.
Yes. The victim was bludgeoned to death before going over the side of that cliff.
now... can I finish my page?
I'll take that as a yes.
I disagree.
I'm just telling you what VAL says.
and how exactly does VAL tell you these things?
Oh, well, if I'm not in my office, you know, she texts me.
look at that.
perpetrator is an experienced rock climber.
I disagree. So does the Jeffersonian.
noted, Sweets. Okay? Just relax.
okay, can we please stop calling it her and she? I mean...
Yeah. So why don't you think the murderer is a climber?
no, I don't think that the killer isn't a climber,
I just think it's crazy to say that he's an experienced rock climber.
there's a difference.
okay. You're agreeing with me, which, you know...
which is good. I like it.
so, our victim is an amateur, he's vulnerable in dangerous situations.
he goes climbing with someone who bashes him.
while he's suiting up, or whatever they call it.
good enough.
and then he tosses him over the edge and makes it look like an accident.
did VAL tell you that?
I don't think so.
the victim exhibited bilateral intercondylar fractures to the distal ends of the femurs.
interesting, Dr. Wells, but irrelevant for cause of death.
well, seeing as how it occurred four months before the victim died, I get it.
keep your shirt on.
Dr. Wells, you are an intern.
please treat Dr. Brennan with the respect she's due.
well, I thought this was a meritocracy. - It is.
then that was the respect she's due. - No, no, it wasn't.
and since she's your... - Don't say superior.
...boss. But I will say superior if I want, because I am also your superior. Do you understand?
so, Dr. Brennan, have you set a date yet? For the wedding.
Oh, we aren't adjusting for anyone's schedule.
if you have a conflict and would like to attend, you'll have to rearrange your schedule.
okay. That's a warm invitation.
concise, to the point. Well said. Bravo.
thank you.
I took a slide from the victim's liver, and as you can see...
cancerous. - Quite advanced.
our victim was terminal.
could you please see if Angela has...
made any progress on identifying the victim.
Yes. Must you interrupt?
I'm just trying to use our time efficiently.
well, it doesn't make you any more likeable.
is likability important?
right now, I'm gonna go with yes.
how can you do a facial reconstruction without any tissue markers?
well, I'm extrapolating the missing fragments based on the general characteristics of a Caucasian skull.
now I'm gonna run this against the DMV database and see what we come up with.
the use of a generic skull is gonna result in far too many hits.
you don't have many friends, do you?
no, I don't. None, really.
that's a shocker.
this is a waste of time.
wow, look at that. One match. Who knew?
I suppose you think your little ding taught me a lesson.
did it? - Yes.
never discount random luck.
having terminal cancer... it's not good.
terminal means end point. The end. Death.
and you know what?
life is better than death.
that's deep. - I don't think so.
but impending death bestows a gift I did not see coming.
clarity. - That's so true.
knowing the end is near lends a bittersweet urgency to every breath, every moment. And you know what else?
fear evaporates.
this is our victim?
that's him. Charlie McCord.
there you go. Take a good look.
high school principal, married, two kids.
what is this video?
well, you know, when he found out that he was gonna die, he made all these videos, he created this Web site where you can buy them; they're incredibly popular.
it's not uncommon for people to ascribe special wisdom to those who are facing death.
that's because they have special wisdom.
watch, watch.
and fear is what stands between us and fulfillment.
once fear is gone, life opens up to all its grandeur.
all things are possible.
this guy's deep.
why do you need our victim's ear canal?
Oh, yes. I want to analyze the cerumen.
the earwax?
it's less icky if I call it cerumen.
look at this.
it builds up like sediment.
you can track his recent activities through earwax?
cerumen.
and even though he snacks on dead humans, he's not a buzzard.
he's a hawk, Cam. Hey, he's a hawk.
Hey, labels are important, you know? 'Cause words can hurt.
I can't believe Charlie's dead.
when was the last time you saw your husband?
four days ago.
can you think of anyone who'd want to hurt your husband?
uh, no.
I-I mean, there were some comments underneath his videos that were pretty mean.
people who said that he was stupid, or that he was faking his illness to make money, but...
you found Charlie climbing a cliff?
is that strange?
well, he was afraid of heights.
well, when fear is gone, life opens up all its grandeur.
you've seen one of his videos.
Yeah, well, he was a wise man.
he was hoping maybe someone would see them and pay us for the rights to write a book.
turns out, people are willing to buy them the way they are.
it's typical.
Charlie's dying, and he's worrying about me and the kids.
I'm sorry, wasn't he in pain?
constantly.
the autopsy didn't show any narcotics in his system.
Charlie wanted to put off drugs for as long as he could.
he would only take homeopathic medicine.
he was a wonderful man.
anyone who knew him would tell you that he was special.
I recovered several videos from the victim's cell phone, one of which you'll find extremely interesting.
one of his live life to the fullest 'cause life is too short videos?
uh, not exactly.
this was time-stamped five days before the murder.
Hey, Chuck, Chuck.
Hey, man, big fan.
what?
obviously, somebody took this video.
wow, that hurt.
pull over! Hey, pull over!
he's mad.
that was incredibly cowardly.
well... - Come on, Angela, how much courage does it take to sucker punch someone?
a lot when it's this guy.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, this is Chuck The Iceman Liddell.
he's a mixed martial arts world champion.
so, Charlie McCord slugged the toughest man in the world?
Yeah. And revenge is sort of the Iceman's thing.
pull over! Hey, pull over!
he's mad.
Yeah, that's me. So what?
getting punched in the face a crime now?
no, murder was the crime.
this guy was murdered four days ago.
you think I did it?
look at you, huh?
looks like you're mad enough.
people come up to me all the time.
sign an autograph, take a picture with them.
I don't get punched in the face for it.
so you're saying you never saw him before?
not till Charlie threw the punch.
wait, then how do you know his name?
he called me after.
apparently, I was on his bucket list
you know, a list of stuff you want to do before you die?
so let me get this straight.
uh, punch the Iceman was on his bucket list?
Yeah, I was kind of flattered when I heard.
he's a nice guy.
really sorry to hear what happened.
uh, let me know if there's anything I can do.
there's evidence that the finger was treated after he slugged the Iceman.
that's the least of his worries. He only had six weeks to live.
there are so many variables to an assessment like that that it is practically guessing.
but if McCord was told he only had six weeks, that would explain his risk-taking.
would it not, Dr. Know-it-all?
I will concede that.
that's mighty big of you.
what's this?
I was thinking about the victim's bucket list, so I made one for you.
cause we all need one, right?
number one, don't be a douche.
number two, really, don't be a douche.
number three, work and play well with others so I'm not perceived as a douche.
do I have to read all ten?
probably not.
you think it's easy being superior?
it's a curse, I assure you.
mostly for us.
there must be a heart in there someplace, Oliver.
I'm just trying to help; it's tough love.
it's misguided, but I understand.
I don't even think he had six weeks. Look at this.
the cancer was spreading to his bones.
look at the marrow, see how porous it is?
Yeah, he was never gonna finish his list.
poor guy.
murdered before he had a chance to die.
sad.
Really?
Yeah. I mean, we all want a little more time, don't we?
to fix things, to go out with our ducks in a row.
check his medical records, see if you can find out who treated his finger.
maybe that will lead to who shot the cell phone video.
okay.
computer profiling is absurd, okay?
psychology takes, um, subtlety and a subjective analysis.
subjective? - Yeah.
well, that's the problem.
a computer program with advanced analytical algorithms would not be subjective;
it would skirt the pitfalls of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
so you're saying after all we've been through, you think a computer would be better than me?
theoretically, yes.
Hey, how's it going?
how's it going? I'll tell you how it's going.
Dr. Brennan would rather work with a computer than me.
but as a lunch companion, I certainly prefer you.
you know what, that's high praise, Sweets.
anyhow, VAL says that the bucket list shows that the victim was
uh, let's see, it says here-- vulnerable because of his illness.
the guise of him as a sincerely good man is a mask to hide his anger and hostility.
that's stupid. That's lame psycho-babble. Stupid.
I hope they didn't spend too much on that program.
I heard three million.
what? - Three million dollars?
I... And they can't give me a raise.
you know, I'm seriously like Call of Duty, and-and that thing is like Elf Bowling.
all right, show me what you got there, Mr. Call of Duty.
I've analyzed Charlie's videos; he's a genuinely good man.
the essence of a bucket list isn't vulnerability.
it's rooted in the simple human desire to realize one's potential before death.
I buy that. You know what, computer zero, Sweets one.
good work, you're back.
thank you.
Val is a moron, all right?
everyone has some kind of a bucket list.
I don't have a list, per se. Well, winning the Nobel, of course, but that's more of an eventuality than a dream.
I've got, like, a million things on my list.
Really? - If you could pick one?
all right, um, you know the guy who did the free-fall from space?
Yeah. - Yeah.
I'd like to buy him a drink.
that... That's... Okay.
Hi, Angela.
you don't want to free-fall?
Yes. Who?
all right. Yes, Booth is here, I'll tell him.
angela got the victim's medical records.
his wife wasn't listed as the emergency contact for any of his hospital stays.
it was a man named Martin Proctor.
so the victim might not have trusted his wife as much as we thought.
are you busy?
Hey. Is something wrong?
wrong? No, I don't think so.
is there?
I-I don't know. You seem like you want to talk.
I do. Is that wrong?
no, I... Forget it.
no, I-I'm not busy, no.
good.
you remember that I'm going to marry Booth?
I vaguely recollect that, yeah.
Oh, no.
he didn't call it off again, did he? Because I can do physical harm.
no, no.
we've just decided that we don't want anyone else to help us plan our wedding.
Oh.
guests will be that, just guests.
and if they don't like pigs in blankets, they may have to bring their own snacks.
booth and I haven't figured out all the details yet.
I don't care how or where you do it, sweetie.
I got married in a jail cell, for God's sake.
booth is a good man, Angela.
he didn't want to hurt me.
it was Pelant who kept us apart.
until he was gone, Booth's hands were tied.
Yeah, I should've trusted him, huh?
Yes.
but it was hard for me, too, at the time.
well, listen, whatever you two decide, I'm sure it's gonna be perfect.
I'm not gonna say another word.
that will make Booth very happy.
listen, I was hoping to help with the dress, though.
I just don't want you ending up in a grass skirt and a headdress.
and that will make me very happy.
and isn't that what a matron of honor is supposed to do?
Oh, my God.
thank you.
it's maid of honor.
well, technically, you're married, so it's matron.
usually, we'd expect to see his wife listed as the emergency contact.
Charlie couldn't do that.
he didn't want his wife to worry.
you were helping him with his bucket list.
was. It was getting too crazy.
I told him if he was gonna kill himself, I wouldn't be a part of it.
what was your relationship with Charlie?
I blew my shoulder out pitching when I was a student here.
torn rotator cuff.
a couple years ago, before Charlie got sick, he got me a job in the IT department.
then he set me up as coach of the baseball team, too.
Oh, wow, so he was like a father figure to you.
Yeah.
and you helped him video his lectures?
edit them, too.
Charlie and I...
we were tight.
even working on this charity together, Quarters for Care.
where were you four days ago?
uh, what are you... what are you saying?
nothing, just doing my job.
Yeah.
Yeah, sorry.
uh, four days ago...
batting practice in the morning, and then went to a movie at Wheaton Plaza.
I think I still have the ticket stub.
Charlie always said I was too fussy.
it's okay, but do you have a copy of his bucket list?
Charlie didn't want Linda to see the list.
there are only two left: go rock climbing and make Lena whole.
okay, um, who's Lena?
Lena Silver. She was a bookkeeper for the school.
Charlie caught her cheating, turned her in; she wound up going to jail.
Charlie felt pretty bad about it, so he was tracking her down.
you think she wanted revenge?
she always seemed nice.
but she lost everything when she went to jail.
even her kids.
Oh, come on. You have VAL, too?
I'm not supposed to tell you.
Yeah, no, neither was Booth. Thanks.
so, what you should be hearing is that we prefer you to Optimus Prime here.
who says... - Oh, VAL told you something, huh?
according to VAL, someone named Lena Silver is our prime suspect, with an 86% chance she committed the murder.
do you even know who that is?
Yeah. Lena Silver was the bookkeeper for the victim's school.
he reported her for embezzling $6, 000, she lost her job, went to jail, lost her kids.
went to jail for six grand?
Yeah. Ensuing investigations uncovered other thefts, so...
sounds like a motive.
could you be 86% certain without any proof?
no. - No. VAL is, huh?
no one's even talked to the woman yet.
I hate VAL. She is stupid. I hate her.
it. You hate it.
you might as well hate a transistor radio.
we're all on your side, Sweets.
Yeah.
um, should you be doing that?
well, I figure if I hurry up and feed him, maybe he'll hurry up and rangle the last bit of evidence.
Hey, I got results from Charlie's ears.
so, cerumen, right, it accumulates at a rate of . 01 millimeters per day.
now, this... Ooh, no, nope. Sorry, not that.
your bucket list?
Yeah, yeah, I got inspired.
I got to check out Area 51, you know?
I mean, the real one, not the fake one they pawn off on tourists.
can't die without that.
earwax? - Right.
Yuck. All that was in his ear?
0. 02 millimeters in, I found acetylene black, polyisoprene, halobutyl, sulfide, nylon, copper, sulphur and steel particulates.
okay, so sulphur, copper sulfide
sounds like he was sleeping with a chemistry set.
tires. - Tires?
pyrolysis.
pyrolysis is the thermochemical decomposition of materials in the absence of oxygen.
he was at a tire recycling facility?
Yep. And based on the depth of the chemicals in the cerumen, two days before he died.
Angie could only find one in the tri-state area.
Riley's Tire Depot. - Mm-hmm.
they have absolutely no record of Charlie buying, selling or dropping off tires in the last couple weeks.
I'll tell Booth.
did I see that you wanted to be shot out of a cannon?
you don't?
but first, I want to leap from the top of the Jungfrau wearing one of those Rocky the Flying Squirrel suits, you know?
of course you do.
Hey, but that's just the tip of the iceberg, you know?
what about you?
Oh, I...just want a villa in Tuscany where I can drink wine and make love.
that's it?
lot of wine and a lot of love.
and not seeing a bird barf.
Ooh, rangle time.
I can cross this off my list.
I was able to reconstruct the skull with fragments that the bird barfed up.
the fracture to the parietal would have caused the dura mater to be torn.
very good, Dr. Brennan.
I say very good, Dr. Wells. Not you.
why can't I verbally recognize your small triumphs?
I don't know.
note the series of radiating depression fractures.
normally, radiating fractures on a skull terminate when they encounter a previous fracture.
the fractures on this skull all overlap as if they happened at the same time.
the wound has characteristics of an injury occurring from one blow and multiple blows.
the evidence contradicts itself.
so we still don't know what the murder weapon was?
he was either struck three times or once.
how can it be both?
so it's really a philosophical question.
no, Dr. Wells, it isn't.
because it actually happened.
most of the people I look up to have taken great risks, both personal and professional.
real growth comes from taking chances.
that's true.
well, he must be right, because Charlie McCord was doing a great business off these videos before he died.
two bucks a pop.
and after he died?
with that publicity?
thousands of downloads an hour.
the wife will clean up if it keeps going at this rate.
another motive.
you know what? Maybe VAL is right.
I mean, Lena Silver lives right next to Riley's Tire Depot.
do you have a tuxedo?
no. Oh, you mean for the wedding?
Yes. - Ah...
no, do I need one?
well, if I will be wearing a wedding dress, we'd look more like we belong together if you're wearing a tuxedo.
like we're standing on top of a cake. - Yes.
with frosting down below. - Yeah.
Ah! Okay, I'll get a tuxedo. - And shiny shoes.
so we're going formal? - Yes, yes, in a church.
your church. I've-I've studied the ceremony.
it's beautiful. Even the superstitions.
you sure?
it would make you happy, wouldn't it?
so, then it'll make me happy, too.
tell you what, if we weren't waiting for a murder suspect to open up that door, I would take you in my arms...
whoa, okay! Oh-oh, easy. FBI, okay?
put the weapon down.
sorry. It's a tough neighborhood.
are you Lena Silver?
Yes.
booth, isn't that a violation of her parole to have a weapon that could have been used to kill Charlie McCord?
okay, we're gonna have to take you into custody, Lena.
you must have been very angry at Charlie, Miss Silver.
he ruined your life.
no, he didn't. I did.
when he turned me in, Charlie didn't know I had two prior arrests.
was I gonna blame him for that, too?
so he got you arrested, and you thanked him?
at the time, I wanted to kill him.
but that was before I went into counseling.
and to be honest, before I saw Charlie's videos.
so after watching Charlie, you learned to accept your situation and forgive yourself?
is there something wrong with that?
no, I think it's very impressive.
bitterness and anger aren't gonna help me build a new life.
or get your kids back.
and killing Charlie wouldn't help get my kids back either.
no, but sometimes we don't think of all the consequences before we act.
people can change, Dr. Sweets. I'm proof of that.
and when I get my kids back, they're gonna have a mom they can be proud of.
we can place Charlie near your house around the time of his death.
I'm gone most of the day.
I'm working two minimum wage jobs.
and when I sleep, I don't hear a thing.
we're gonna have to hold you until we test the pipe to see if it's the murder weapon.
I'd do the same thing if I were you.
let's be clear.
we're all riding in a boat that's destined to sink.
it's the journey that gives our lives meaning.
we're all flawed. We could all be better.
but focusing on the negatives, it merely makes us negative.
my life will be over soon.
but I'm not afraid.
I'm grateful.
probably not grateful to be murdered.
he was a wonderful man.
these videos will probably help a lot of people.
and make his wife quite wealthy.
Yeah, that, too.
have you done a scenario?
Yeah.
was the pipe a match?
uh, no. I ran a bunch of different simulations, and there were no scenarios where the blows from the pipe caused the damage to the victim's skull.
so Lena Silver is probably not the killer.
Yeah.
Hey, you said you wanted to help me with my dress.
Yeah.
I want you to look at something.
Oh, my God. Where did you get this?
I've had it since I was eight years old.
you've had this that whole time?
it's the dress I always imagined I'd wear on my wedding day.
but then I grew up and my life changed, and I didn't think about it until now.
is it okay?
Yeah, it's perfect.
you might not admit it, but you're a dreamer.
and this is... this is your bucket list.
I hope they can make it in time.
well, they will, or they'll have to answer to me.
no one messes with the maid of honor.
I'm so happy for you.
Oh, hey.
so, VAL still thinks that there's a 96% probability that Lena Silver is the prime suspect.
What?! No! The pipe isn't a match.
my profile completely dismisses the possibility of her as the murderer.
I know, I know, but the department wants us to factor in VAL every time we release a suspect.
Seriously? - Yeah, seriously, Sweets, seriously.
you know what I think about that?
this is what I think about that. Kicking it to the curb!
couldn't you get in trouble for that?
look, I don't mind trouble.
but if you're wrong about Lena, I'm blaming you.
thank you, Booth. I-I really...
all right, enough. Don't get all mushy on me, okay?
we still have a murder to solve.
I hate computers, always have. Let's look at some paper.
Charlie McCord's will was released today.
look at that.
Oh, wow. He was splitting all future income from his speeches between Lena and his wife.
and it explains what his bucket list meant by making Lena whole.
right. Charlie's wife couldn't have been too happy about that.
this little guy is really sick.
there's got to be some kind of poison in his system.
I'm running a blood culture and tissue sample.
I studied veterinary science for two years.
it doesn't appear to be avian pox.
bird flu? You're going there?
that's a mutated strain.
I would've thought you knew that.
don't start, Dr. Wells.
sorry. I just assume people usually understand basic principles...
dude, that is starting. Now, I found polyethylene, styrene-butadiene, canvas, cellulose and synthetic rubbers inside the rangle, but nothing in quantities that would cause this.
arsenic.
Oh. - Arsenic in the wild?
no. There's no carbon.
it was poison, and it was in the victim.
that's who the hawk was feeding on.
the victim was poisoned.
we attributed the porous bones to chemotherapy...
but Charlie stopped chemotherapy almost a year ago.
so it was the arsenic that prevented the bones from remodeling.
if it was the wife, she's brilliant.
in a murderous kind of way, of course.
you must have been pretty upset when you found out that Charlie changed his will.
why would I be upset?
because Charlie planned on leaving Lena Silver 30% of the income generated from his speeches.
that's, like, a million dollars.
Charlie felt terrible for the woman.
he said he ruined her life. She lost her kids.
it's reasonable for you to think that money was yours and not hers.
have you even watched any of Charlie's videos?
Yes. - I ordered the whole series.
then you know what kind of man my husband was.
kind, compassionate, generous.
you ordered the whole series?
I found them very inspiring, okay?
look, just because your husband was a good man...doesn't mean that you're a good woman.
I wouldn't have taken a second from Charlie's life.
this world is poorer for him being gone.
I am amazed that everyone doesn't feel it, but I do.
and yet, you fed him arsenic.
what? I did not.
the homeopathic remedies you gave him.
they were just herbs and other Ayurvedic remedies.
they contained arsenic.
we found it in his system when we examined his remains.
but you said that Charlie was hit on the head.
well, we're gonna have to consider the possibility that you became impatient.
Oh, my God.
I was just trying to help him. I swear, that's all.
I gave him that medicine to help him.
if you look closely, ...
the depression fracture to the skull , has a slightly smaller hinge, on the bottom than the top.
that means it came from a blow that was delivered with an upward motion.
97% of strikes are by an overhand motion.
Yeah.
Dr. Brennan, would you like to grab a coffee with me sometime?
maybe lunch or perhaps dinner?
I'd pay.
what you're proposing, Dr. Wells, is completely inappropriate.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not like a-a date.
I mean, it's a date, but not a sexual date.
I-I don't have any friends.
that's because you're objectionable.
what I'm looking for is someone that I can have a conversation with without shutting down three quarters of my brain.
I'm tired of being lonely, and I'm hoping that you will be that person.
I decline, Dr. Wells.
I don't like you.
so what? I don't like you either.
what does that have to do with anything?
the subject is closed. The victim was struck by a side-arm motion.
probably because the killer couldn't rotate his arm from above.
Yes, Dr. Hodgins?
Yes. Yes. I, uh, I found traces of cupronickel, uh, on canvas threads in the last bit of rangle.
quarters are made from cupronickel.
I know what happened.
Oh, my God, I don't.
the canvas was a bank bag for deposits.
Yeah, for the quarters they raised for charity.
martin Proctor struck him with a bank bag full of quarters.
but what about his alibi?
martin Proctor's alibi is this movie ticket that he just gave to Booth.
can you prove that he bought it?
well, there's a confirmation code on the stub, and usually the code will link to a credit card purchase.
but he said he bought the ticket in cash.
Yeah, and murderers never lie.
we think that Martin Proctor killed Charlie McCord, - which means he did not purchase this movie ticket. - Okay.
and you're right.
this was bought by credit card by someone named Loraine Nemitz.
he must have fished the ticket out of the trash.
martin Proctor was never at the movies.
he has no alibi.
we know that this is the deposit bag you ruckharles McCord with.
I was at a movie.
no, you weren't, okay?
this is not your ticket.
all right? You have no alibi.
Why? Why, Martin?
Charlie was a good guy.
why'd you kill him?
the videos started to make some money.
Charlie was paying me for my time.
couple hundred bucks here and there.
and then he told me that he was gonna give 30% to that lady crook.
I went with him to all of his bucket crap.
I took the videos of his lectures, cut them together.
I deserved a percentage of the profits, too.
but Charlie said no.
maybe he had a good reason.
he did.
video number six.
the importance of independence, of being forced by circumstance to take care of yourself.
I wanted money, not a lecture.
Oh, so you killed him?
I hit him. I-I didn't want him to die.
you know why?
wait, because he was a good guy?
because killing him means I'll never get that money.
at the end of the day, we're all gonna make mistakes.
we're all going to do things we regret, even to those we care about.
it's unavoidable.
but at the end, what matters is how you address your failings.
how you treat your family.
how you treat your friends.
how you forgive.
and how you love.
Oh, and one more thing I've realized.
you never get the whole bucket list done.
you just keep adding things to it, because every day there's something new to amaze us.
that's how we know we're alive.
Dr. Wells.
Oh. Hey, Dr. Saroyan.
uh, I was, uh, I was just... I was just talking to VAL.
you were, um, talking to VAL?
Yeah, she has the most amazing sense of humor.
she.
I asked her, I said, if you're so smart, what's the greatest lesson Jesus ever gave us?
and she said that, Heaven is like 3x squared plus 8x minus nine.
I have no idea.
that's the equation for a parabola.
and parabola is funny?
it's a pun. On the word parable.
because Jesus's greatest wisdom was handed down in the...
Yeah. - In the form of parables.
guys, I'm ready.
a parabola.
okay.
what's happening?
Val is being sent back.
she picked the wrong murderer and she upset our team dynamics.
well, th-then the team is stupid.
maybe, but it's that kind of stupidity that makes us so good.
wait, no, uh, don't take her.
please. C-Can I buy her?
can I... can I have her?
government property.
please! This is the most scintillating conversation...
I'm sorry, Dr. Wells.
No!
so be surprised.
cherish the time you have.
cause every day is a gift.
every moment a blessing.
I think Christine has finally gone to sleep.
Why? It doesn't work both ways.
no, no, I don't think that's true.
I swear she knows when we relax.
just put it down. - All right.
there you go. Okay.
bones, you got nothing on your list there.
well, you've written down ten things.
Yeah.
come on, there's got to be at least a hundred things you want to do before you die.
I don't know. I'm very happy.
I have a very good job that I enjoy, a lovely home, a healthy and smart child...
Yeah, but...
and I love the man I'm going to marry.
that is pretty good. Pretty good.
I mean, if I were you, and I had me,
I wouldn't write anything down on a list either.
you're teasing me.
I am.
but look at you.
you know, this... these are just little things.
you know, where I want to go, you know, climb things, go to outer space, huh?
what, lean on the Tower of Pisa?
did you get your tuxedo?
I will.
we should probably decide where we want to have our reception.
founding Fathers.
great free wings.
Oh, a better place obviously.
we don't get married every day;
our wedding shouldn't feel like an everyday thing.
I love every day.
hold on, turn that thing off.
what? - I'm not...
she can't see.
the musicians will wait for my signal, then once everyone's set...
Oh, my God! - Angie, it's just a rehearsal. You can't keep crying.
I can and I will. - We only have the church till 11: 00.
can you cry after 11: 00?
can't forget the best man.
no, he'll be dressed on the day.
my son's flying in later. So. hey... - That's my dad.
this isn't really necessary.
this is just to get a general idea...
he isn't very dependable, but I imagine my father will be here.
I'm sure. - How can you be sure?
he's just being nice. - Don't worry, Bones.
Max will be here, all right? Ju... Can we hurry this along?
I have been trying. Okay, then, after opening rites, we have the first reading.
Dr. Hodgins? - Got some stuff from Ecclesiastes that's gonna kill.
Oh, I'm sorry.
uh, no problem.
uh, then after your reading, Dr. Sweets will... - Oh, God.
I'm sorry. - Don't worry. God grants me patience for just such events.
no, no, Bones, don't even pick it up. Shut it off.
just put it away. Put it away.
no... - Oh, I'm sorry. Am I allowed to kiss him now?
it's really just a rehearsal, Dr. Brennan.
because we are sleeping together.
sleeping, of course, is a euphemism for sex.
no. I'm really sorry, Father.
you don't have to apologize, Booth.
it's not like he's going to be jealous.
so, moving on, we have uh, the reading, music, the homily, blah, blah, and then your father will...
Oh, gosh, I-I'm sorry. Sorry.
I thought I turned it off. Sorry.
that will not happen again.
Yeah. - Okay.
okay, then. Here we go.
excuse me.
yes?
no, I do last rites, but I don't do murder.
it's for you. - Me?
Yeah.
sorry. This will just take one... Booth.
they found the remains on the grounds by a senatorial building, the one on P Street.
that's where the President used to stay.
they were excavating for a new gazebo.
the remains are being brought directly to the lab.
which will not concern Dr. Brennan or Agent Booth, will it?
well, we're not getting married until tomorrow.
I should really take a look. - Oh, no.
what do you mean,"Oh, no," Rings, kiss, vows... hitched.
are you serious? - Yeah, totally serious.
you know, work is good. Keep her busy. Don't worry about it. Yep, let's go.
see you all back at the lab.
I'll put $25 on the wedding being canceled by lunchtime tomorrow.
Yeah. 50 bucks says it's canceled before the sun goes down.
worst friends ever.
the victim is female, mid-30s.
almost completely skeletonized.
remaining tissue is desiccated.
this happened a long time ago.
multiple stab wounds to the chest;
degree of staining on the clothes suggests she bled out.
Fabric-wise, it looks like the victim died in the '70s.
1979, to be precise.
that's impossible to know at this stage.
afraid not. Cicada. It was caught in her sleeve.
they only emerge once every 17 years, meaning our victim was killed in 1979.
or I guess, 1945, or 1962, 1996.
okay, we get the point. 1979 it is.
you see, Brennan? This is gonna solve itself.
you are not needed.
and since the wedding is tomorrow, you should get your beauty sleep.
I don't need sleep to be beautiful.
no, but it does help you be pleasant.
we have this under control, Dr. Brennan.
Angela, can you take this paperwork and see what you can restore?
got it. - No one here is a forensic anthropologist.
without me, you won't be able to... - Dr. Brennan, what are you doing here?
what are you doing here?
I asked him to come because you have your mani-pedi appointment.
I can't, in good conscience, leave until I feel confident you are capable of handling the case.
I'm gonna chalk that up to nerves and not be insulted.
good call.
would you just stop acting like the wedding is doomed?
Brennan really wants this.
then why are we here?
I mean, this case is over 30 years old.
it could wait till Monday.
Hey, look at this.
what is that, a protective sleeve?
Yeah, for, like, a photograph or an important document.
Yeah, but it's empty.
Oh, hey, I found it. Her I. D.
laminated. That's helpful.
Nancy Handelman. She was born February 5, 1943, which makes her 36 when she died.
poor thing.
listen, Brennan's just nervous, okay?
it happens. But we have to support her.
we have to stay positive.
I will be as positive as a proton, I promise.
I got your text about the wedding pool.
I'll put $50 on it being called off by 3: 00.
Yes.
they'll call if they find anything, so just get home, okay, Bones?
I think your dad is here. His stuff is on the counter.
I told you he'd make it.
all right, hurry back. I love you, too.
Hey, Max, are you hungry?!
bones is gonna go pick up Christine and...
looks like I'm gonna need a new bag.
Really?
I mean, I think it's very generous.
you know, it's tradition for the father of the bride to pay for the wedding.
Max is obviously a traditionalist.
okay, did you hear me?
the bag looked like it was buried.
maybe it's just dirty.
Oh, come on, Sweets.
look, I'd advise you to just concentrate on the wedding.
how's Dr. Brennan doing?
okay, look, this is the area where the body was found, right? Up in that one.
you're really gonna duck the question by hiding behind your work? Okay.
used to be part of Adams University. It was sold off ten years ago.
what are those buildings?
grad student housing and faculty offices.
I'm gonna do a background check on all the tenants from 1979.
and you know what? I am not hiding behind my work, okay?
I'm just trying to keep Bones busy so she doesn't get nervous.
and get cold feet.
listen, Bones doesn't have cold feet, all right?
actually, they're warm. Actually, they're very hot, thank you very much.
I'm on your side, okay?
and I think what you're doing is great psychology.
as far as the bag full of money, you're right, it's-it's kind of creepy.
go do something else somewhere else.
okay. - Thank you.
Dr. Hodgins, what have you got for me?
Brennan's done with her mani-pedi.
I meant... - Right. Sorry, sorry.
today, all I seem to think about... - The wedding pool.
Wh... No. What kind of a person do you think I am?
that was rhetorical.
all right, these are the results from the stab wounds.
now, traces of iron-carbon alloy.
so the weapon was made of steel.
Yeah. Also, I got some particulate residue from multiple insect and foliage species.
inside the wounds?
that's odd, especially in an urban area.
still working on trying to I. D. the various species.
is that our victim?
booth just e-mailed me her file.
Nancy Handelman was single, no living family, worked at the Library of Congress in the Manuscripts Division.
the Manuscripts Division?
maybe that acid-free sleeve she was carrying did contain something important, like the letter that Nixon wrote confirming the presence of aliens, or even a map that reveals...
slow down, Da Vinci Code.
as far as we know, she was just a simple librarian.
I know what you're up to.
Yeah, I'm not up to anything.
okay. If Brennan realizes the enormity of this case, she's gonna ditch the wedding, so you want me to keep quiet until after the nuptials.
Yes, Dr. Hodgins, nothing gets by you.
angela told me not to touch anything, so can you pick up rib five?
two minutes with you and I'm back to being an intern.
note the peripheral indentation, as though from a hilt, so the weapon could've been short.
Medio-cam, please?
Oh, I guess I should be glad you're saying "please.
a little more steady, Dr. Edison.
I have to solve this case before I consummate my marriage.
a splinter. Dr. Hodgins will want to see this.
hair.
you have to get your hair done for the rehearsal dinner, honey.
no, that makes no sense.
I have my hair done today for the rehearsal dinner and then again tomorrow for the wedding? Why?
because you're the bride.
so just accept and adapt, okay?
did you place a bet on this wedding?
I prefer not to tell you while you're wearing your tough face.
is that the protective sleeve from the victim's bag?
on the left, yeah. whatever was in it might have been the motive for her murder.
but whatever was in it is long gone, and without it...
not necessarily.
this image on the right, I found that folded up in the victim's wallet.
it's a photocopy. See the outline?
Oh, so you think that this is a photocopy of what was in there.
I'm still working on the restoration, but I'm hoping to pull something from it.
Dr. Saroyan, I'm finding a large number of micro-fractures on the bones.
Dr. Brennan doesn't know yet. - She missed them?
only because you told her not to touch anything with those fingernails.
what's the question, Dr. Edison?
if I tell Dr. Brennan about those fractures, she's gonna check them out.
these fractures are gonna take at least two days for both me and Dr. Brennan to catalogue, and for her to check my work.
the wedding is tomorrow.
simple. We don't tell her.
we can't lie to Dr. Brennan.
normally, I would agree with that, but this time we lie our asses off.
or we could call in the reserves.
and that's why I'm checking with you, because that would entail extra costs.
I bet the reserves would come in for free.
Yes, because they don't have to really do the work.
Dr. Brennan just has to think that it's covered. - Tricky.
Yes. Tricky is an excellent coping mechanism when dealing with people like Dr. Brennan.
Dr. Brennan, I thought you'd be home getting ready.
I'm checking Dr. Edison's work so that I can talk to him before I leave.
uh, he doesn't need your help.
how can you say that?
these indentations could have easily caused the micro-fractures to the ribs.
but we don't have a murder weapon that matches any of these.
trust me, Dr. Brennan, Dr. Edison's got plenty of help.
where did we get the budget for this?
that's not your concern.
what is your concern is getting to that rehearsal dinner.
I owe you one, all of you.
okay, well done. Thanks, guys.
though, while you're here, I do have a few questions you might be able to help me with.
uh, we were told ten minutes, max.
I have a date. - I have therapy.
I have to go get ready for the wedding.
sure, rub it in that you're dating the boss.
you do know Saroyan's gonna want to get married now, right?
what?
does anyone besides me care about this poor, murdered woman?
I see your hands, and my body trembles with memory;
your touch is like coarse silk against my bare skin, pulling me ever closer.
you can't read that at my wedding. There's gonna be kids there.
no, no, no. It's from Angela.
Oh. Well, that figures.
it's text from the letter found on the victim.
Yeah. It's very erotic.
and the voice is definitely female.
and there's mention of her lover's wife.
well, the librarian... she was having an affair. - Uh, possibly.
gives the wife, you know, a nice, clean motive to get rid of her.
right. But here's the thing: The language seems antiquated.
and it was found in one of those sleeves that you use for collectibles.
problem? It's not Dr. Brennan, is it?
no, no. It's... it's... It's about Max's money.
dirty?
not from the dirty bag. I mean... illicit money?
I got it. No, okay? The money is clean.
you seem disappointed. - Because something is off.
you don't carry around a sack of cash like that.
I mean, not if you're honest.
Max isn't like other people.
that's what I'm afraid of.
I don't want a SWAT team crashing my wedding.
all right, Booth, this is just your anxiety talking.
all right? You're deflecting your concerns about your wedding onto Max.
you're right. You're actually right.
because, you know, he wasn't a fugitive for all those years.
you know what? I gotta get out of here.
I'm late. Gotta get to the airport, pick up my son.
Oh, tough decision.
Ah, they're both nice.
now, results from the remaining particulate samples.
first, the simple part: that wood splinter inside the bone was Cocobolo.
it's not indigenous to this country, so it must be part of the murder weapon.
am I wrong to assume there's also a not-so-simple part?
the foliage and insect particulates from inside the wound?
right? There weren't just a few.
there were many different species, from many different parts of the country.
you think the body was moved postmortem?
unless the killer moved the body from Massachusetts to Georgia to Virginia, there's got to be another explanation.
I just don't know what it is.
Oh, God... give everything you have to the interns.
we do not want this hanging over Dr. Brennan's head or this wedding will not happen.
okay. All right, uh... You don't want in on the pool?
no. Dr. Hodgins?
20 bucks says it's cancelled by 1: 00 tomorrow.
Oh, God, I hate myself.
london is a long flight, okay?
you must be tired.
I'm fine.
I can't wait till Christine wakes up from her nap.
Yeah, she's sleeping, huh?
and if you have to go to work...
no. I don't have to go anywhere.
I am exactly where I want to be.
right here with my son.
mom packed my tuxedo.
that's what I'm supposed to wear, right?
Yeah. You know, we're gonna look like a bunch of waiters out there.
or better yet, some penguins sliding around on the ice.
I'm glad you're marrying Bones, you know?
mom's happy for you, too.
Thanks. I'm happy.
I'm happy you're here.
all right? So, look, I have this list of things that I need to remember to get done, all right?
and I need you to make sure I don't forget.
me? - Yeah, you.
that's what a best man does, and I'm asking you to be my best man.
Really?
all right? - Thanks, Dad.
I love you. - All right, look it.
here's what we gotta get.
this is a hair comb that I got in the Marais in Paris.
these aren't real jewels because I couldn't even afford bread then,
none of the fractures on the calcanei are remodeled.
there are other fractures... - Okay. I don't care, honey.
I am giving you the "something borrowed" that you need.
it's also blue and old, so we've got three out of four down.
I'm sorry. Thank you.
have you found the provenance of the letter yet?
no, I'm-I'm focusing on your wedding.
cause somebody has to.
I just want all the information in order before I leave.
Brennan, this is insane.
it's bad enough that I didn't have time to throw you a bachelorette party.
don't spend your last few hours working.
why not?
because you don't want your fingers to smell like death when Booth puts on the ring.
there's a murder victim.
that is an objective fact.
it's my job to find out who killed her.
Brennan, she's been dead for 35 years.
I think she can wait a little longer.
did you even look at the hair comb I gave you?
it meant a lot for me to give that to you.
my feelings... they're a jumble...
but this case is something I understand.
you understand happy, right?
go with that.
one more minute and I'll leave.
have you catalogued all of the injuries?
I've filled one binder so far. But we're still examining.
there's chipping from an indeterminate cause which...
you're stating the obvious, Mr. Fisher.
a high school student could do that.
the coccyx and sacrum show bruising. - I was going to say that.
Micro-fracture of the left olecranon.
that, too. I swear.
the perimortem micro-fractures on the calcaneus bones indicate repeat blunt force trauma, probably from a flat object like a 2x4.
very good, but you will not be helping with the remains anymore, Dr. Wells.
you have to find the provenance of the letter fragment.
I'm doing that.
you have a wedding to prepare for.
and Dr. Wells is a polymath and more than qualified to do the research.
and if he isn't, we dismiss him.
no one likes him anyway. - I kind of do.
you're a constant surprise.
if I have to think about the remains instead of my wedding, I will be very unhappy.
you wouldn't want that, would you?
no, absolutely not. - No. No.
I thought not.
good luck.
now I would like to try on that comb.
we're not even getting paid.
I am.
you know, I just thought, look, you know, before I get married, you'd be able to give me some advice, here.
I'm not a priest anymore, Booth.
I know. Okay? I know that.
but the real ones, they don't know me like you.
we could've done this at the bar.
come on, Aldo, will you just cut me some slack, here?
okay.
I'm jealous.
what you and Temperance have, it's the reason we draw breath.
you screw this up,
booth, and it'll be worse than any hell God can dream up for you.
I agree.
I'm Max.
I'm Tempe's father.
this guy... he thinks I'm still a crook.
he still thinks I'm a priest.
what are you doing here, Max?
well, I saw you were here, and I though maybe you had... had a change of heart.
so you're following me?
he's a good father.
I tell you what... I've never seen anything more right.
I'd be proud to call you my son.
I only wish that Tempe's mother was here to watch her walk down the aisle.
me, too.
Thanks.
all right? Thanks.
Thanks. Hey, I tell you what.
why don't we go light her a candle, huh?
come on. - Well, she really wasn't the religious type.
it's... you know what? I'll light it.
it can't hurt, right? Come on.
it'll be like she's part of the ceremony.
she'll be, uh, watching over us, huh?
what the hell.
can I say that?
Yeah, what the hell?
I'd like to make a toast before we go.
no, no, Pops, we're running late.
you do that at the rehearsal dinner, okay?
just a little one, Shrimp, a private one.
I've been waiting for this day ever since I met Tempe.
then I'm going after him.
then I'm going to sing a song.
a little one. Actually, two.
I'm pretty hungry. - We should hurry.
we don't want to be late to the dinner.
Yeah. - You know what?
we're getting in trouble for loving them.
better not to listen.
you're a lucky man, Shrimp.
you found a woman who's willing to stand up to you and call you on your crap.
my what?
you can be stubborn.
and if she's willing to stick around and try to civilize you, then you'd better listen and make adjustments,'cause that's love.
I just want say a couple of things.
when I was on the run, trying to stay alive... which wasn't easy...
dad.
no. This actually sounds good.
you know what? Maybe I should go while you clean up your story.
Seeley, what you have here... is the final piece to the puzzle.
it's what's going to make you whole.
Tempe is the woman that I always wished I could be, and the one that every mother always prays that her son will find.
now I'm gonna cry. How can I a speech if I'm gonna cry?
Oh, don't cry. I still have to sing.
Oh, hold on, that's the guy, the limo driver. We're probably late.
let's get everything together here, huh?
yeah? - Turn on the TV. The church.
what about the church?
a passing motorist called 911 at roughly 7: 00 p. m.
when they spotted smoke coming from the Sacred Heart Catholic Church.
by 7: 30, it was a three-alarm blaze with several area fire departments responding.
investigators have yet to determine the cause of the fire, though it seems to have started from the back of the sanctuary.
my God, Booth.
you burned the the church down?
these are some zesty eggs, Pops.
gramma, those are Pops' famous Eggs From Hell.
at my age, who wants bland food?
spicy lets you know you're alive.
Hey, you can take off the tux, there, buddy.
the wedding has been postponed.
he likes it.
makes him feel like James Bond.
Where's Temperance?
she's back on the case, now that the, uh, wedding has been delayed.
you should elope.
what's that?
means going to a Justice of the Peace to get hitched.
no fuss, no bother.
pops, forget it, okay?
I owe Bones a fuss.
eloping is romantic.
chicks dig romantic, Dad.
that's true.
what do you mean,"chicks"?
there you go.
hot! Hot!
I told you it was too spicy.
it'll leave a stain.
Oh! Okay, that's a sign from the gods, huh?
best man ruins his tuxedo?
looks like we'll have to postpone the wedding till we can do it right.
dad.
come in.
you all right about the wedding?
Yes.
the damage to the victim's feet is confusing.
see, I-I-I think it's my fault.
Oh, not the victim's feet. But the wedding.
booth says that Mom burned down the church.
your mom did not burn down the church.
booth says that Mom burned down the church because she didn't want you paying for the wedding with dirty money.
your mom knows where the money came from and she was all right with it.
mom's dead.
you want the truth?
that money comes from a magical night in Vegas where I just couldn't lose.
it was 30 years ago.
I was playing blackjack and I won all this money.
I... I thought, well, okay, I might as well bet it all.
statistically unwise.
and then I realized what it was for.
your wedding.
so I grabbed it and was out of there, and I buried it, and,'cause you know, banks and bank robbers.
Booth's gonna be my son-in-law.
I think he should have just... trusted me.
you can understand his reticence, Dad.
Yeah.
you want my advice?
get married... today.
I've called eight churches, Dad, none of them are available today.
it doesn't have to be in a church.
it could be at City Hall.
it could be underwater or bungee jumping.
church is very important to Booth.
and I love him.
I want him to have what he wants.
sure.
I have a question. - Is it about the iliopectineal line?
no, it's why I wasn't invited to the wedding.
none of us were. - I was invited.
not really. You're just going a plus-one, dude.
we work here. We're not friends with each other, we're colleagues.
it's a small, intimate, friends-and-family wedding.
not for us.
Aw, your feelings are hurt.
aren't you supposed to be working on the letter?
I am. I just crave the camaraderie of my peers.
I'm just kidding. Angela's office smells like sage.
findings, please.
Mr. Fisher?
well, the majority of micro-fractures were confined to the heels of both feet.
with a secondary number of micro-fractures on the ischial tuberosities.
the amount of damage to both the right and left calcanei is almost identical.
the victim was dragged down the stairs.
the cracks on the ischial tuberosities further support that scenario.
those occurred when the body was dragged onto the landings in between flights.
how many big a building are we talking about?
taking into account the victim's weight and the height of a standard stair riser and the amount of spiderweb fractures...
72 stairs and eight landings.
come on, guys. It's not that hard.
fifth floor.
I used to work construction.
only one of those buildings at Adams University sharing that courtyard had a fifth floor.
cutting our suspect pool down to the perhaps 20 academics that worked on that floor.
we still need a murder weapon.
I feel a little bit guilty, but I think I may have won the pool.
you're giving that money to charity.
Yeah, can't really argue with that. - Exactly.
complete "Weddings"?
what are you up to?
I can't let their wedding be postponed again.
you know what's amazing? I was just about to say, "Angie, I think you should throw a wedding for Booth and Brennan."
you were?
sure, yeah.
there's just so much to be done if this is gonna happen today.
today?!
Yeah. You think that's crazy?
I should, but no.
because I have absolute faith in your absolute faith that they should be married today.
you do?
well, listen, we cannot breathe a word of this to anyone until we know that we can pull it off.
sure, all right.
what if Booth and Brennan won't agree to go through with this?
Hey, if you build it, they will come.
I hated that movie.
yeah? Well, it doesn't matter.
it was built, and they came.
okay, so we know that the victim was killed and then dragged down five flights of stairs.
and we know the murder weapon left traces of a wood found only in Central America.
Cocobolo is a wood used in making guitars.
I don't think she was stabbed with a guitar.
and woodwind instruments.
death by clarinet? That'd be awesome.
look, if we don't solve this, Dr. Brennan is gonna blame us for everything, probably accuse me of burning down the church.
well, that one's easy to blame on Agent Booth.
I think we should all show a little compassion.
they're about to start a new life, and now all their dreams have been shattered.
you're just being nice 'cause you were invited to the wedding.
a pool cue.
there was trace in the wound from carbon steel, but no pool cue has a steel tip.
Yeah, but the size is right.
so what else the size of a cue has a steel tip?
Hey, I have a few things to arrange for Brennan, so, you sure that you can handle this?
I'm running the pattern - recognition software right now.
okay, you don't have to be snottier than usual.
I'll be a phone call away if you need me.
and don't break my machine.
the letter the victim was carrying was written by Emily Dickinson.
what? - The poet.
Yeah, I know who Emily Dickinson is.
that-that would make the letter extremely valuable.
certainly give someone a financial motive for theft and murder.
are you sure that it's Emily Dickinson?
the punctuation mirrors that which was taught at Mount Holyoke where Dickinson studied.
the rhyming is experimental and inexact, and the single speaker is consistent with the style of the 19th century, so, yes, I'm positive.
Oh... my... God. Let me see that.
no. You said Dr. Brennan was your first priority.
and you would never forgive yourself if you neglected her well-being because of this case.
Yeah, you're right. Thank you, Oliver.
and you're completely unnecessary.
well, the squints found us a suspect.
Janet McCann. She's an Emily Dickinson scholar.
the victim had correspondence with her.
how did they land on her?
victim was killed and dragged down five flights of stairs.
McCann's office was on the fifth floor of the Humanities Building at Adams University.
she, uh, steal and sell the letter?
I don't think money was a motive on this one.
according to McCann's scholarly work,
Emily Dickinson's writing was an attempt to feel something that she had never felt before.
you're saying that Dickinson was a virgin?
that's the conclusion of most biographers, but the letter proves that wasn't true.
now, if the victim had published it,
McCann's entire academic career would've been pointless.
look, we have worse motives, okay?
we just still have to find a murder weapon.
I'll, uh, I'll call the squints.
I'm already on it. I figured you could use a break.
I'm fine.
okay.
you know, Bones'll never admit it, but, you know, she was dreaming about that wedding.
I wouldn't worry too much about Dr. Brennan.
she's a lot stronger than you think.
right.
okay, okay, that's enough of that.
booth was looking forward to this wedding so much.
and it's still gonna happen, sweetie.
so dry your eyes because today's the day.
Angie, I swiped the keys for all the exhibits on the second and third floors.
we're all set. Hi, Dr. B. All right, I gotta hustle.
what are you doing?
that does not concern you.
all that matters is that you two are gonna tie the knot today.
I've got it all under control.
but Booth wants us to be in control.
Yeah, well, the killer wanted to be in control, too.
I don't understand.
that professor wanted her Emily Dickinson story to be the only real one, right?
but circumstances changed.
just like here.
the details aren't what's important.
the poetry, that's what's important.
and the poem here is you and Booth.
so don't put off what you two have wanted for so long because a few details have changed.
but Booth can be stubborn, Angela.
not about this. Because he loves you.
and if you're okay with it, then he will be, too.
but I don't know if I'm okay with it.
I'm your best friend, sweetie. Trust me.
you're okay with it.
so this is from the last book that Janet McCann wrote on Emily Dickinson.
it's her bio on the book jacket.
in addition to her post at Adams University, "Professor Janet McCann is also an avid hiker, "and hopes to soon complete what has been a years-long quest:
exploring the entire length of the Appalachian Trail.
the trace particulates Dr. Hodgins found: shagbark hickory, found throughout these states along the trail.
insect and foliage particulates from Vermont to West Virginia.
Yeah, it fits.
the killer was a hiker. - It was a trekking pole.
we identified the one in this picture had a steel tip and a Cocobolo shaft, manufactured in the late '70s.
it's a match for the injuries.
unfortunately, I don't think there's gonna be a trial.
booth found out the professor suffered a stroke two years ago.
she's in a nursing home confined to a bed.
so now Dr. Brennan is free and clear to get married.
Oh, I wish it were that easy.
angela says we're getting married today.
so Angela, she's calling the shots now?
uh, yes. She's planning this whole emergency wedding.
bones, she would have us getting married in a garage.
look, I know what this wedding meant to you, and the flowers and the dress.
I don't care about any of that.
it's you who I'm worried about.
me?
why me?
the church.
I know how important that is to you.
I didn't ask for that.
that was your idea this time around.
because of you.
bones, I would wear elephant tusks on my head and have a squirrel monkey do the wedding ceremony if that's what you wanted.
you really don't care?
no.
well, neither do I... as long as you're there.
we've waited long enough.
we have.
so, we're doing it?
we're doing it.
I'm not certain if you are aware, but Agent Booth and I are getting married today.
congrats, Dr. B. - Suck up.
being polite is not the same thing as sucking up.
I'm pretty sure that it is. - We're all very happy for you.
Yeah, says the guy who got invited.
well, he didn't really get invited.
he still gets to go.
that's why I asked to speak to all of you together.
the work that you did solving this crime, not only was it expertly done, it was like, a wedding present to me, and I'd like to invite all of you to the wedding.
what, as like some kind of reward?
no.
then why?
because Angela said that I should.
no, no, that is not why.
that's not actually why.
why are you asking us now but not before?
I didn't invite you to my wedding because I thought it would be cruel.
excuse me?
none of you has found a life companion.
it seemed unfair to ask lonely people like yourselves to watch the joyous celebration Booth and I had planned.
but Angela says that you are my friends as well as my colleagues, and as such, you will take joy in our good fortune.
so, I'm inviting you.
I have to go put on my dress now.
I have a girlfriend. She's awesome.
are you gonna marry her?
welcome to the losers' club.
do we get to bring guests?
no, no, and the wedding starts in a half an hour.
I don't really have a dress for this.
I don't even own a jacket.
no worries.
I have got you covered, my peeps.
history of fashion exhibit, third floor.
I'll bite.
look at all this.
it's like every woman's dream.
good to know.
Oh, my God.
this couldn't have turned out better, honey. I-I am so proud of you.
Thanks, Mom.
thank you.
all right. - Okay.
you ready, Booth?
I've been ready for years.
Hey, thanks.
you're a lucky man, Booth.
I know.
I'm sure you know how happy I am for both of you.
and, Booth, it's my fatherly duty to tell you that if you do anything to hurt my girl, I'll kill you.
Thanks, Max, for all of this.
dad.
and by the way, I won the pool.
I knew it was today that you would tie the knot.
this is not one man ceremonially handing over a woman to another man as though she's property.
okay? - Come on, Bones.
ladies and gentlemen, friends and loved ones of Seeley Booth and Temperance Brennan, if anyone here has any reasons why these two shouldn't be married, keep it to yourself or get out because this is going to happen.
it is!
I'm a psychic, and I promise you, this is gonna happen.
now, I foresaw this a long time ago when I first...
sorry, everyone.
lucky for me, Seeley and Temperance have written their own vows.
so we'll start with Seeley Booth.
all right.
okay, um...
you know, I worked really, really hard on my vows, but you know, now that we're here... Look, um, hey.
do you remember the last time that we were here?
standing right around in this spot?
it was, um, right in the beginning, before we really knew each other.
I was trying to get away from you, because, um, you were irritating me.
and, uh, you chased me down, and you caught up to me.
I said to you,"Listen, I just have to get all my ducks in a row, right?"
and then you said to me... - "I can be a duck."
Yeah.
you know, we have been chasing each other for a long time.
we've been chasing each other through wars and serial killers and ghosts and snakes and...
you know, chasing you has been the smartest thing that I have ever done in my life.
and being chased by you has been my greatest joy, but now we, uh, we don't have to chase each other anymore because...
we caught each other.
we didn't bring enough Kleenex.
and now, Temperance, will you be speaking from the heart as well?
no, I will be speaking from my mouth.
when Hodgins and I were buried alive, we each wrote a message to someone we loved, in case our bodies were ever found.
Hodgins wrote to Angela, and... I wrote to you, Booth.
dear Agent Booth,"You are a confusing man.
you are irrational and impulsive,"superstitious and exasperating.
you believe in ghosts and angels,"and maybe even Santa Claus, and because of you, I've started to see the universe differently."
how is it possible "that simply looking into your fine face gives me so much joy?"
"why does it make me so happy that every time I try to sneak a peek at you, "you're already looking at me?
like you, it makes no sense.
and like you, it feels right.
if I ever get out of here,"I will find a time and a place "to tell you that you make my life messy and confusing and unfocused and irrational and wonderful."
this is that time.
this is that place.
did I do that wrong?
no.
by the powers vested in me by the District of Columbia and the Internet,
I now pronounce you man and wife.
you can kiss me now.
aldo didn't say that I could kiss you.
as usual, she's right. Go.
so, what do you think happens now?
everything that happens next.
there's a hacker named Christopher Pelant.
where are you? Pretty much anywhere I want to be.
this guy's killed how many people? Eight.
this guy is worse than anyone you and I have ever come across.
Hello, Temperance. Pelant.
what do you think happened to poor Chloe Campbell? I think you killed her.
wasn't me. You know who did it.
uh, same person who did 187-05-7932, and 9224-- they were all killed by one person, and I think she's still out there.
you okay, Bones? The next explosion will level the entire building.
shoot him, Booth. What?
shoot him!
and if anything happens to me, she'll keep doing what she's doing, and you'll never find out who she is.
who's taken these remains?
who has these remains?!
who's been in here?!
you shouldn't have shot me, Temperance. You'll never find the killer alone.
you'll never find... You'll never find the killer alone.
you'll never find the killer alone.
you hate me. You hate me... hate me.
no, I don't! No, I don't! Give me those remains!
without me... without me... you'll never find what connects the victims, Temperance.
where are you?! Where are you?!
No! What? What is it?! What?
what? It was Pelant, Booth.
Oh. Again?
he had the evidence, all the bones, and then I was buried.
it was a dream, right? He was laughing at me, Booth.
what? He said that I would never find the Ghost Killer.
Pelant is dead, right? I will find the killer, Booth. I will.
okay, all right, I know you will. It's just, it was a dream, okay?
you need to get some rest, all right?
rest. Come on. Okay.
come here. Okay. Hold me.
okay... All right... I got you.
tighter. All right.
I'm right here. It's okay. Shh.
I'm right here.
I don't understand why Cam won't believe the serial killer is real.
well, it's 'cause there's no evidence that they're linked. I mean, there's nothing conclusive.
which is why she should keep the case open. I need the resources.
you know, you have to admit,
I mean, from the outside, it does look like um, Pelant was just, you know, playing you.
is that what you believe? Look, I mean, come on.
you've been poring over this case for months, and you haven't come up with anything.
we can't just, you know, launch an investigation on a ghost.
so you don't believe me? No, it's not that. I just...
you know what?
I don't want to argue. It's a beautiful day, huh?
I'm gonna go get the paper.
bones, you expecting a package? No. Why?
well... one here.
no. Wow.
what kind of sick joke is this?
someone took great care in packaging these remains.
there's a note.
please find out what really happened to me.
based on the shape of the frontal bone, the narrow nasal aperture and the size of the mandible, the victim was a Caucasian female.
aren't you even the least bit freaked out that these remains were sent to your house?
I'm the best forensic anthropologist in the country. Wouldn't you want me examining your remains?
I think Angela was referring more to the mysterious nature of the delivery.
and the fact that it was to your home, - not the lab. - No.
there's too much red tape here. They may not have even made it to me.
desiccated skin, soil... this person was interred at least a decade.
I'll see what particulates I can get off this.
whoa, did you sleep in those clothes?
what? No.
uh, apologies, uh, for being late. Why are you even here?
I called him when I thought we might be dealing with archaeological remains.
ten years does not classify these as archaeological. Well, I'm already here, so I might as well help out.
I don't need another forensic anthropologist. What I need is an intern.
none of whom are available, and you need help, Dr. Brennan.
so, boss me around.
I'm ready. Clean these.
no postmark? No fingerprints?
it's no surprise-- anyone who digs someone up and delivers them like takeout
of course they're going to be careful, Sweets. You okay?
no, I'm not okay, okay, Sweets? I'm not.
someone delivered a dead body to my house. How can I be okay?
right. Sorry. It's just, it seems...
and Bones is having nightmares again.
Oh. Yeah.
she thinks there's another serial killer out there. Because that's what Pelant told her before he died?
Yes. He just wanted her to think that he was necessary.
right? And she feels the need to prove that he's not.
okay, Pelant is dead. The guy is dead.
why can't anyone just accept that?
I understand. Okay, then, help me with the case.
all right, look at the case. Maybe it'll take Bones's mind off this craziness.
okay. Well, the remains are painstakingly wrapped in cloth.
right? And the note implies that the truth of her death was never known, so, whoever did this took a big risk because they care about the victim.
but how do you know that this is not some psycho playing some sick games with her?
unfortunately, we don't.
the victim is Lana Brewster.
died at 18 in 1995. Wasn't she a sailing champion?
Yeah. The Coast Guard found
Lana Brewster's partially sunken boat.
well, it's hard to miss a boat that big.
well, she wasn't on her racing boat that day.
she had taken out her regular, everyday boat.
multiple boats. Must be nice.
her body was found washed up on the rocks a couple days later.
so, lots of postmortem damage from wave action, fish, rocks.
this solo round-the-world race she took, It began in Newport, Rhode Island, and made stops in Cape Town, Sydney, and Rio.
it's an amazing achievement until you consider that it doesn't actually achieve anything.
it was inspirational. She was a hero for millions of teenage girls.
I'm seeing a remodeled fracture to the victim's right tibia.
the break didn't properly heal. Oh, yes, that happened during the race.
she set it herself and then continued racing. How do you know that?
it was kind of a big deal at the time, sweetie.
Lana Brewster accomplished this crazy, inspirational, round-the-world race, and then dies a few months later during an afternoon sail in calm weather?
it doesn't really make sense.
Hey, I found these lodged in the skin around the victim's wrist.
some kind of fiber. Well, she was buried in silk, and the lining of the coffin was satin. This is neither.
and I'm seeing pores and follicle spaces.
leather? Yeah.
and judging by the film filling the pores, this is treated leather.
leather on the wrist...
Hey, were leather string bracelets a thing in 1995?
I don't know but it's not on the list of materials interred with her. And it wasn't an open casket funeral, so it couldn't have been tossed in at the last minute. All right.
well, there's something else, too.
traces of trillium pusillum pollen on both the box and the victim's bones.
it still contains live cytoplasm. So it was deposited after the body was removed from the grave.
Yeah. And since there's no trillium in the cemetery, then the remains must have been brought somewhere else before dropped off at Booth and Brennan's.
okay, well, do that thing where you figure out where stuff comes from.
you're so lucky I know what you mean.
somebody dug up my sister?
Yeah, and delivered her remains to a forensic anthropologist who works for the FBI.
well, who would do that? We were hoping you could help us with that.
well, I haven't got a clue.
we think that whoever did this loved your sister and wanted the authorities to reopen her murder investigation.
listen, I know where you're going with this, but I'm just not that guy.
you're her brother. You're her only living relative.
I barely knew Lana, and what I did know I didn't really like.
Why? Looking back, maybe I was petty, but Lana was famous
magazine covers, TV appearances-- and my parents loved that.
but I was just a regular kid, so I was nobody to them.
can you think of anybody who does have strong feelings for your sister?
according to my parents, everybody.
everybody in the whole damn world.
she sailed around the world alone. What's not to love?
okay, well, whoever exhumed your sister's remains left a note.
please find out what really happened to me.
now, obviously, this person doesn't think that your sister just drowned.
I think there was a boy. A boyfriend?
I heard my parents talking about it.
they didn't like him.
do you know this boy's name? No.
when they saw I was there, they stopped talking...
like always.
I have Lana Brewster's original autopsy report.
any surprises? Yes.
it was utterly incompetent.
very little detail. She died of drowning.
there's practically no mention of broken bones, no cataloguing of tissue damage from fish.
or the traces of leather found on both her wrists. She was bound?
there's nothing in here about that either. Lana Brewster was a public figure.
how could the medical examiner escape scrutiny?
the little bone damage she did catalogue was listed as postmortem, when it's obviously perimortem.
whoever sent you these remains was right to do so.
Lana Brewster was murdered.
cam says the medical examiner working on Lana's case wasn't just negligent, but that she lied about Lana's cause of death.
why did she cover up the murder? Money, it seems.
before the Brewster case, Leslie Dollinger was just a temp medical examiner, brought in when the backlog got to be too much. And Lana Brewster was the last case she worked on?
Yeah, before she started that case, she had $2, 000 to her name.
after she released the report ruling the death accidental, she received a $1. 9 million transfer into a brokerage account in her name.
Yeah. After that, she never worked again.
she took off to Costa Rica. Well, hey, we have an extradition treaty with them.
if we can show collusion...
the only way you're gonna talk to Leslie Dollinger is through a psychic.
she died of an aneurysm eight years ago.
well, do we know who paid her off? I'm working on it.
bones? Been waiting outside in the car for a half an hour.
you said you'd be right out. Oh, sorry.
I... I lost track of time.
this isn't the Lana Brewster case, is it? No.
it's a serial killer. The markings on this sternum are very similar to the markings on this one. "Similar.
that's never been good enough for you before.
I don't want to argue, Booth. I don't want to fight either.
but, you know, I'm... I'm concerned about you.
I mean, you're having more nightmares. No, I'm used to them.
neuropsychologists now think that it's the mind excreting feelings and information that it can't process awake. And I think you're obsessed.
you're so obsessed you don't even know how to shut it down, even when you're asleep.
so you don't believe me? Look, I want to.
but where's the evidence that links them?
real evidence. Hard evidence.
I learned that from you.
do you think I'm crazy? Yeah, a little.
I do. This is not you.
no, there's a link. I will find it.
that's fine. Tickle the bones, and do whatever it is that you do.
but do it how you do it.
all right? Don't let Pelant call the shots.
all right? Don't keep him alive.
otherwise you're never gonna find the answers.
let's go home now, okay?
the Ghost Killer's gonna be here in the morning.
okay, I'll put these away.
Dr. Edison?
Oh, shoot! Dr. Saroyan.
the security guard just told me that you slept here last night.
can I get a towel?
uh, it's-it's chilly. I can see.
employees are not allowed to use the facilities as a second home, Dr. Edison.
I wasn't. I wasn't.
um, I just worked late. That's all.
assuming I believe you, you should manage your time better. Y-You're right.
I mean, sometimes I just get lost... That doesn't explain sleeping here.
well, I had a lot of work, so I might have dozed a bit.
you've been wrinkled and disheveled for two days. You're never wrinkled and disheveled.
would you like an explanation? No.
Really? Whatever it is, will be complicated and none of my business.
all I want is for you to follow the rules handed down by the Jeffersonian board, so I don't have to fire you. Yes, sure, yes.
now put on that wrinkled shirt and get to work.
jealousy is always a good motive for murder.
there was another sailor that competed against Lana for the Paxton Cup.
they were contemporaries. I remember this.
it was, um, Erika something.
Yeah, Erika Stamp. Erika Stamp.
how did you know that? I used to sail.
Erika Stamp, she actually won, didn't she?
Yeah. I never knew you sailed.
Yeah, I was a rich kid, you know? We had to sail and have at least one girlfriend named Muffy.
it's in the charter. Erika did win, but then the cup was taken away from her and given to Lana Brewster, who came in second.
I remember this. Erika cheated.
Muffy? Yeah.
I dumped her for Binky.
now, Binky, Binky was hot. Oh, my God.
I am so disoriented right now. I got to admit, I am, too.
it says here that Lana was actually the one that reported Erika for cheating.
Erika never recovered. She wasn't allowed to compete again, right?
Uh-huh. Yeah.
she also served some jail time.
for what? Insurance fraud.
she intentionally sunk her boat for the insurance money. She pulled out her transducer.
well, that'll do it. Yeah.
and when Lana's boat went down, it sunk in the exact same way.
the transducer.
Lana Brewster's the reason my life went to hell.
I can't believe I have to talk about the little bitch again.
18 years, the anger's still very fresh, huh?
I borrowed one small roll of tape from a passing boat to fix my sail.
Lana could've let that go. But, no, she had me disqualified for it.
you'd be pretty pissed, too.
so in your perception of events, Lana cost you everything.
she did cost me everything. I lost my endorsements.
I wasn't allowed to compete. My family practically disowned me.
now, you sunk your boat in the exact same way that Lana's killer sunk hers.
look, anyone familiar with sailboats knows the easiest way to sink one is by pulling the transducer. Okay.
well, where were you the day that Lana was murdered? Okay, look.
I've served time... so I know you're fishing, and I don't have to stay here.
if you have any other questions, find someone who cares.
there is no way I would ever go out in a boat like this.
I'm gonna start calling you Popeye. Hey, I won a few races in my day.
Oh, yacht club? It was mandatory.
Hey, the boat's outboard motor is missing.
maybe she didn't it. Can you enlarge the image?
all right, see these marks?
this is where the motor would normally be clamped on.
maybe she left it at home that day or something. No, it's unlikely.
Why? What are you thinking?
Hey, was her dinghy found with the boat?
Oh, according to the Coast Guard files, no dinghy or outboard motor were ever recovered.
Yeah, of course not. What?
whoever killed Lana probably put the motor on the dinghy to get back to shore after sinking the boat.
that's why neither was ever found.
I'd like to help, Seeley.
but Dr. Brennan has no evidence to link these cases to a serial killer.
has she ever asked for something like this before? That's not the point.
that's exactly the point, okay? She's having nightmares, okay?
she can't stop thinking about those cold cases.
I'm gonna get in trouble for spending funds to allow her to pursue a dead end.
and if I don't report what she's doing, I'm hiding expenses and I could get fired.
so let her find out, that it's a, it's a dead end. You know she's gonna admit it if she's wrong.
I do? Just let this play this out.
I'm sure you can get creative with the paperwork.
do you believe her, Seeley? I want to.
don't you?
I'll see what I can do.
Aw, man.
yacht clubs, sailing, prep schools. Mm-hmm.
you're dealing very well with the loss of your fortune.
truthfully, I thought it would be harder.
but I don't know, when I'm at work, I'm not thinking about money, you know?
when I'm with Angela and Michael Vincent, it never crosses my mind.
I mean, even with you. The coffee's good, the company.
I'm impressed. As long as a person has enough, they don't need more.
and I've got more than enough. 'Cause I saw pictures of that, uh, estate you had in Wales. Whoof!
Oh, yeah. Okay, now that place was sweet.
Oh, man, I do miss that. Thank you very much.
Hey, so, I found out who paid off the medical examiner.
the $1. 9 million that Leslie Dollinger received was from the Kestech Transpo Corporation.
who owns Kestech? Well, I had to dig deep because Kestech is owned by a holding company which is owned by a bunch of other holding companies, but I tracked it down.
Kestech is part of the McNamara Corporation.
Oh, my God, the McNamaras.
Yeah, McNam... They're as rich as you were.
Nah, they were richer. I mean that-that's railroad and oil money.
my dad used to play golf with the patriarch, Giles.
I mean, our families, we hung out together. Okay.
the financial trail leads right to your old friends.
the McNamaras paid off Leslie Dollinger to cover up Lana's murder.
okay, so how is Lana Brewster then connected to the McNamaras?
excuse me? Trent McNamara.
Hey, didn't Lana's brother say she had a boyfriend? Mm-hmm.
and you think it was him? His father was always bailing him out of one mess or another.
he also went through girls like they were toys.
Trent McNamara was a nasty piece of work.
Trent McNamara was a pretty troubled kid.
he got kicked out of four prep schools for cheating, drugs and assault.
wait a second. What kind of assault?
fighting mostly. The last school tried to channel that aggression into fencing.
and he was good, but he got kicked out of that, too, when he took the tip of his foil.
what are you saying? He actually stabbed someone?
in psychological terms, the kid was a mess.
and get this, two days after Lana's body was found, his father shipped him off to some private school in Switzerland.
oh-ho, okay. Fleeing the country and falsified coroner's report.
it doesn't look good for Trent. Maybe that's what the note with Lana's remains meant.
please find out what really happened to me.
you think Trent is what happened to her? You can ask him.
what? Is he in town?
his father died three days ago. Trent's in town for the funeral.
but can I make a suggestion, Booth? Send Hodgins instead of me.
Hodgins? Why?
Hodgins is a blue blood, like Trent. They even knew each other.
whoa, wait a second-- Hodgins speaks rich people language?
exactly. Okay, I got a even better idea.
why don't you and Hodgins go talk to him?
but... Booth?
Dr. Edison... Oh! What?
I was just getting something to eat. Good.
I mean, I could have eaten at home, no reason except that, you know, I just wanted to get a jump on the day.
what do you think of Dr. Brennan's serial killer?
I'm sorry. Excuse me?
do you think those cases are linked? Is there a serial killer?
I'm asking for your opinion.
I'm skeptical. Excellent.
these are the files on all six Ghost Killer victims.
I want you to oversee this one.
does Dr. Brennan know you're making me responsible for these? She doesn't need to know.
but I'd like to keep this between us for as long as possible. Oh, yeah.
this is nice. You said that with an edge.
no, I didn't. This is why you brought me, Sweets, okay?
I heard the envy in your voice.
there he is.
Yeah, and that's his sister Stephanie.
wow, time has been a bit tough on Trent.
I remember him as an athletic golden boy. Now he looks like hell.
okay, I heard a definite tinge of satisfaction in your voice.
Yeah, you did. Trent was a dick.
it's good to see you, Jack. I'm sorry to hear about you losing your family's money.
must be difficult. Jack never really seemed to care much for money.
as long as he had his bugs. I'm doing fine, Steph.
I married an amazing woman, I have a beautiful boy, so...
no complaints, actually. We want to talk to you about Lana Brewster.
the sailor girl?
Yeah, her brother told us that she had a boyfriend around the time that she died.
didn't say who it was, though. Thought it might be you, Trent.
boy, you really must be a part of the FBI. Should we call our lawyer?
it was me. What?
you liked a lot of girls, Trent. Why'd you keep this one a secret?
because I was in court-ordered Alcoholics Anonymous.
you're not supposed to start a romantic relationship when you start AA.
so why did you skip town right after Lana's death? He didn't skip town.
it was a coincidence. We ran out of American private schools.
dad was hoping the Swiss could handle me.
we have evidence your father paid off the medical examiner to cover up the fact that Lana was murdered.
you think I killed Lana? Looks like that's what your father thought.
Jack! We all know how these things work, okay?
he was trying to protect Trent.
it's been really lovely seeing you again, Jack, but this is definitely the part where we call our lawyer.
do you concur this is probably cause of death?
Yes. Why didn't we see this earlier?
it was obfuscated by the blunt force trauma that fractured the sternum.
do you think this could have been cause by a foil?
Oh! From fencing.
Yes. Yes, that is possible.
Dr. Brennan? I've seen this wound before.
on one of the Ghost Killer victims. That seems unlikely.
everyone keeps telling me that I'm making connections that aren't there.
but I don't do that kind of thing. I'm not that kind of a person.
Dr. Brennan, we're supposed to be working on the Lana Brewster case.
these remains are the ones that Pelant led me to months ago.
the ones where he said all of them were murdered by the same serial killer?
a woman, yes. So this has nothing to do with Lana Brewster's case.
I believe Lana Brewster was the first victim.
Chloe Campbell and Lana Brewster were both killed as a result of a nail-like stake being punched through their sternum.
it's a very unique injury. The indentations are different.
I can't corroborate your supposition. I don't need your approval, Dr. Edison.
Yeah, but you do need someone to back you up, especially if you're accusing Trent McNamara of being a serial killer.
I already said the serial killer is a woman. Dr. Brennan.
do you recall Trent was a fencer and this wound is congruent with a sharpened foil?
Trent McNamara didn't murder Lana Brewster.
because Trent McNamara is not a woman? Exactly.
Dr. Saroyan wanted me to ask you to return to the lab.
our first priority is solving Lana Brewster's murder.
so you don't believe me, either.
it's not about belief. It's about the evidence.
you taught me that.
if Dr. Saroyan wants us to get back to the lab, we should...
I know who you are. You're not supposed to be here.
Yeah, I'm not here in an official capacity...
I don't care why you're here. This family's been harassed enough.
now if you don't leave this property...
it's okay. It's okay, Donna.
Jack, why are you here? I told him to leave, Mr. McNamara.
I can call the guys... It's okay.
I got this. You can work around back right now.
you know I'm not supposed to talk to you, Jack.
yeah? Then you let me talk.
I never liked you, Trent.
you were that guy, the one who took pleasure in tormenting the weaker kids.
is this going someplace?
you know, I remember the night that you slept over at my place.
and my mom and dad, they came in to say good night, and they gave me a hug and a kiss.
you know, I didn't think anything of it.
but you asked if something special was happening.
you said you couldn't remember if your parents ever did that.
and of course, you made fun of me, because you were supposed to be strong.
but I saw how much you wished it was you.
and that's probably why we never hung out after that, 'cause you were embarrassed that I saw that.
and you think I'm the same. You think that I killed Lana.
I get it. You didn't have to drive all the way out here to tell me that.
but I don't, Trent. I think you did love Lana.
and...
I don't think you would kill someone who gave you what you wanted for so long.
you're the only one, Jack.
the remains from the six Ghost Killer murders are missing.
no, they aren't. I assigned them to Dr. Edison.
and there is no Ghost Killer. Not yet, at least.
I'll have them sent back to me. No, you won't.
I'm your boss, Dr. Brennan. Don't forget that.
everyone's colluding, working against me.
I don't understand. Why would you give those remains to Dr. Edison?
because Dr. Edison is an objective eye. Perhaps, but I'm better.
not when you don't see clearly. You want those six murders solved, don't you?
that means that I have to assign resources in pursuit of that end.
but to do that, I have to convince the board, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that there is, in fact, a serial killer.
and my word isn't enough? Would it be for you?
with no evidence? Look, I am trying to help you, Dr. Brennan.
and I think you know there is no one in the world that would work harder to impress you than Dr. Edison.
that is not true.
of all the people working at the Jeffersonian, he is the least awed by my abilities.
that is absolutely true, if you mean the complete opposite.
I've already done so much work already.
I have binders filled with findings.
then I suggest you give those to Dr. Edison, because he is the one who will determine whether or not we're looking for a serial killer.
that is my decision.
you can't tell Cam. Tell Cam what?
well... these weapons are for the Lana Brewster murder.
but these are for the Ghost Killer.
the Ghost Killer? We owe it to Brennan, don't we?
even if it comes to nothing? You really are a wonderful guy.
even if you did sleep with a Binky. You don't make that sound as good as it was.
sorry, uh... what did you need, Angie?
Yeah, uh... It's Trent.
uh, Booth just called. Trent shot himself.
what?
I-I just saw him.
what did the note say? Um, I-I don't think there was a note.
after everything that happened, Trent would've left a note.
okay, Cam can check. She's going out there now.
I'm going, too. Honey, I don't...
I have to, Angie, okay? I can help.
the window was closed, and I wasn't too sure...
thought Dr. Brennan would come. This is all flesh.
not her domain.
I don't believe this. Are you sure you're okay, Dr. Hodgins?
Yes. I have a job to do.
we can get somebody else to gather the particulates... They might miss something.
I can do this, Cam. Okay.
a single gunshot wound to the temple.
no other evidence of foul play on the remains.
this sure looks to me like an admission of guilt.
excuse me, Officer, uh... have you find a note yet?
Steph, you really shouldn't be here right now.
I don't know why I'm surprised.
you were expecting this? No. Not this.
it's just... something. It's always something in this family.
Trent killed a girl, probably just 'cause he was sick of her, and Daddy didn't care, he just sent him away.
look, Steph, I'm gonna take you into the other room, okay?
I'm gonna get you settled, all right?
Trent was the last male.
I think that's a good thing.
we'll release his body as soon as we can.
I suppose a funeral will be expected.
it'll be big... even though no one cares.
Hey, Steph, let me take you into the other room, okay? We'll get you settled.
Hey, Cam wants to know if you have the results from Trent's swabs.
she wants to finish the autopsy as soon as possible. I'm just waiting on the Mass Spec.
when I went to go see him this afternoon, he was wearing this shirt.
I'm so sorry, honey.
we could've turned out the same way, you know. We had the same kind of life.
Yeah, but you turned out a lot different. Thank God.
he was such a dick and all, you know?
but he just didn't seem like the kind of guy who would kill someone.
that was more his dad's thing. That's why I went to go see him, you know?
just to tell him that. But I don't know, I don't know.
maybe that just made it worse. Maybe that's why he shot himself.
no, honey, you didn't have anything to do with this. You know that.
if he was the killer, he would've left a note, Angie. He would've told us why.
things don't always end as neatly as we'd like them to.
I just keep hoping that we missed something somewhere that, you know, he wasn't a murderer.
Yeah, but so far, the evidence says we haven't.
are those the results for Cam?
antimony, barium, and lead." What does that mean?
it means Trent's hands tested positive for gunshot residue.
cam will use this to confirm that he... he shot himself.
since you have been doubting my judgment as a forensic anthropologist,
I'll allow Dr. Edison to explain this to you. I absolutely trust you, Dr. Brennan.
by having Dr. Edison do my work? I don't think I should be here for this conversation.
I agree, but Dr. Saroyan wants you here, so proceed, Dr. Edison-- tell her what I found.
if you agree with my conclusions.
Dr. Edison?
the victim has a remodeled injury to the carpals on his right hand.
it's indicative of a deep laceration that cut all the way down to the bone.
I thought I was explaining. You are. Very slowly.
a cut this deep would have severed the median and ulnar nerves at the wrist.
in which case, Trent would've been able to point, maybe even throw up a peace sign.
but he wouldn't have had any fine motor skills.
Trent McNamara was incapable of bending his trigger finger, which means he could not have shot himself.
with any other gun, I'd agree with you, Dr. Brennan, but the weapon he used was a stainless . 357
that only has a three-and-a-half-pound trigger pull. It's very light.
it would have been painful, but he still would have been capable of pulling the trigger.
then why didn't he simply use his left hand? He was trying to kill himself, Dr. Brennan.
suicides use their dominant hand 98. 8% of the time.
exactly. There's still a possibility that this is not a suicide and an even greater possibility that he did not murder Lana Brewster.
isn't that correct, Dr. Edison? Leaning hard on the word "possibility," but yes.
Hey. I just finished going over the visitor logs that the techs sent over from the McNamara estate. And?
Dan Brewster visited Trent less than an hour before he died.
Yeah, I went to see Trent McNamara. What's the big deal?
he's dead. What?
how? It was either a suicide or a death made to look like suicide.
why'd you go see him? He called me.
this explains a lot. Why?
he told me that Lana worried about me.
he said that she felt terrible about Erika Stamp, too.
they used to be close.
why did you say, "This explains a lot"?
it's obvious now, isn't it? He was making amends.
you're saying that Trent was tidying up loose ends before killing himself.
Yeah.
I know what you're thinking.
Wh... Why would I kill him? For revenge?
you were the last person to see Trent alive.
Yes, and that's exactly how I left him... alive.
Oh! Dr. Brennan...
good evening.
do you have the time to do this properly? Excuse me?
I'm concerned that if it comes to a choice between the Ghost Killer, your archaeological endeavors, and your personal life, the Ghost Killer will lose.
by which I mean win.
Nora and I are breaking up after eight years together.
there comes a time when, if a couple doesn't make that next step...
you see, Nora wanted to get married, and I ...
I think Nora has found someone else to move forward with.
I mean, I can't prove it, but as you know, you don't always need proof to know when something is true.
even if it isn't,
Nora and I are not together anymore, and I have to tell you I'm, uh...
I'm very... I'm very sad about that.
so, yes...
I promise that I have more than enough time.
I won't let you down.
thank you. That is a great relief to me.
I'm sorry for the emotional pain you're going through.
and I admire the fact that it hasn't impeded your impressive abilities to work.
thank you.
you know, I'm sorry that that all spilled out.
I'm-I'm not... I'm not really sure what happened.
that happens to me, too.
I hold things in, and then watch out!
good night, Dr. Brennan. Good night, Clark.
I think you should call me Temperance. At least when we're alone.
mm, "Temperance.
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.
but I'll try.
cam, Cam, Cam, Cam! Okay, stop saying my name like that.
I found traces of the same microscopic pollen on Trent's clothes as were on the box that contained Lana's remains.
so you're saying Trent dug up Lana Brewster's remains and left them on Dr. Brennan's front door?
well, that's a reasonable conclusion. Which means he didn't kill her.
that's not so reasonable. You think he wants to get caught for a murder he committed 18 years ago?
he shot himself. It seems like an admission of guilt to me.
I don't buy it.
cam? Oh, God.
I read your autopsy report on Trent McNamara. Yup.
cause of death: gunshot wound to the head.
I noticed that he had an avulsion fracture to the third distal phalanx of his left hand. Yes, his fingernail was ripped off.
probably from a sailing accident, reefing in a topsail or something.
Lana Brewster sustained the exact same wound.
these are very unique injuries.
I thought you might want to tell Dr. Edison for his Ghost Killer File, or whatever he's calling it.
so you think there's a possibility that Trent was killed by the Ghost Killer?
shouldn't we look at every possibility? All right.
don't you want to tell him yourself? I was going to, but something else came up, and then I thought we should do this your way.
my way? Yes.
it's your lab, so we should do things your way.
good night.
boom! Voila.
I'm not hungry. Yes, you are.
you just don't know it yet-- Here.
the inquest is going to rule that Trent McNamara killed Lana Brewster and then committed suicide.
but Lana Brewster and Trent McNamara both had their fingernail ripped off.
it's too coincidental.
what do you think? Uh, you know what?
I think we're gonna catch her.
her? That's what you said, "her.
but you believe me? Okay, look, if you don't trust the evidence that Trent killed himself, then I don't trust the evidence.
that's it? That's it.
now take a bite of that sandwich-- eat up, it's good.
Mmm, good, right?
I was hungry. Mm-hmm.
you know me better than I know myself.
I do, right? I do. Kiss me.
good sandwich, huh? Right? I got your back.
look, all I'm saying is that church could be good for Christine.
will she learn about the Crusades and the Inquisition?
Seriously? Why don't you just read her a Superman comic?
it's also a fantasy about a mythic hero whose powers defy the laws of physics and common sense.
okay. You're saying that Jesus and Superman are the same?
Jesus walks on water.
Superman flies. No different. I don't believe this.
listen to you. Christine has already been baptized.
she... You said were okay with that. That was for you.
I don't want Christine to think that morality is handed down by some invisible deity.
morality evolved to preserve the species.
whoever this is, thanks for saving me.
right, okay. J-Just hold on for a second.
we got to go to Virginia. They found a body in a septic tank.
no reason to go. Bring it to the lab to avoid on-site contamination.
hold on for one second. Okay, so you want to...
dig up the entire septic system and bring it back?
it's not a desire... it's a need. It's a... it's a need.
right. Okay. Um...
small favor.
shouldn't take long.
good.
now lower it gently so we avoid any postmortem trauma to the remains.
Dr. Brennan, I'd like to introduce you to Rodolfo Fuentes, a prospective intern.
it is such a pleasure meeting you.
I must tell you, Dr. Brennan, I am in awe.
I imagine you are. However, I'm not looking for a new intern.
actually, we have no available intern for you today, Dr. Brennan.
so before you rush to judgment, at least look at his resume.
you hold a doctorate in forensic anthropology from la Universidad de La Habana?
Dr. Fuentes was the chief forensic anthropologist for the Cuban government.
although I was granted asylum in your wonderful country, my accreditation is no good here.
but I am taking classes and need an internship for my degree.
the Secretary of State himself requested that we find Dr. Fuentes a position.
so you defected. But I am exceptional.
so I have come to America to reap the fortunes that come from being the best.
but here you are only exceptional if I say you are.
put on a lab coat and be back here in five minutes.
if you disappoint me, I will dismiss you.
how Cuban of you.
she is fiery. Yes.
be careful. We've all been burned.
dumping someone in a septic tank treats the victim as waste, not to mention the potential toilet training issues the killer must be dealing with.
it's... interesting. Right. Sounds fascinating.
let me ask you a question. Close the door first really quick.
I just sat down.
it's, please. Hurry up. I got to ask you a question.
really important. All right, so...
are you religious?
am I religious? Uh, okay.
I... Well, I guess you could say that I'm spiritual but not, uh, denominational.
so you think that it's important to have something in your life that's bigger than ourselves.
definitely. This is about you and Dr. Brennan, huh?
look, I want Christine to go to church so she has the information to choose what's right for her.
okay? Bones thinks that's indoctrination.
so make the argument for church without addressing the spiritual component.
this is promising. Go on. Keep going.
go on. Okay. Uh...
recent studies have shown that regular church attendance is good for your health.
they cite decrease in blood pressure, stronger immunity...
blood pressure. You are, like, the greatest psychologist ever.
do you guys read, like, a magazine or something? It's American Psychiatric Journal.
american Psychiatric Journal?
so, you really met Fidel?
Yes. I asked him if socialism is so wonderful, why is Cuba's newest car a 1959 Buick?
please focus, Dr. Fuentes. Of course, Dr. Brennan.
I still can't believe you excavated the entire tank.
it's so wasteful, unnecessary and expensive.
so American. I love it.
based on the rounded supraorbital margin and partial closure to the sphenofrontal suture, the victim is an adult male.
please wait until I ask, Dr. Fuentes.
a thousand pardons. One is sufficient.
but you were correct. Of course.
our situations could easily be reversed.
easy there, Doc. Fidel's got nothing on Brennan.
there's extensive flesh and muscle that will have to be removed.
I thought the chemicals in the tank would dissolve a person.
it actually takes longer for anaerobic bacteria to dissolve flesh.
fortunately, the process makes the meat tender and easy to separate.
much like cooking ropa vieja, a dish my father taught me that is filled with love.
and who can say no to love?
why have we stopped working? Yeah.
so, I need to actually examine the waste in order determine what went in the tank when the victim did.
and we are clearly missing bones that became disarticulated in the tank.
without them it would be presumptuous to posit whether this was a murder or a tragic accident.
which is why Dr. Fuentes needs to be fitted for a Hazmat suit.
we are missing the fifth right distal phalanx, the left medial and intermediate cuneiforms, as well as the right patella.
using your hands would allow for a more productive search.
this looks a lot like the prison my uncle was sent to for selling Die Hard videos.
is this really necessary, Dr. Brennan? Dr. Hodgins would love to be in there.
I am a little jealous.
this will teach Dr. Fuentes his proper position in the lab.
he's far too confident he has all the answers. I've found cause of death.
well, how can you be certain? Because...
...I, too, am excellent at my job. I found this fingernail.
the victim was still alive when he was placed inside the tank.
tried to claw his way out. Oh, God...
so he drowned in there? Yes.
shall we share a bottle of Arecha to celebrate my discovery?
the presence of aspirated fluid confirms that drowning was cause of death.
your X rays, Dr. Fuentes?
Yes. I have them here for your learned and beautiful eyes to see.
in addition to the numerous perimortem fractures,
I also found a newly remodeled sharp force injury to the medial aspect of the left seventh rib.
Oh, he was stabbed. How old's the injury?
based on the degree of remodeling, approximately six months.
meaning our victim had a previous attempt on his life.
within the remodeling, I see a shard of what appears to be Plexiglas.
I worked a lot in prisons. The victim could have been stabbed with a shiv.
if he was, it's possible he served time, which could be a lucky break, because...
the Department of Corrections keeps records of all the inmates' tattoos.
the victim was Benny Jerguson, 24.
he just finished a two-year stint for grand theft auto.
thanks for coming in, Officer Fowler.
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth. This here is Dr. Sweets.
nice to meet you.
I, uh, brought notes from all of Benny's appointments, drug tests and psych results.
gotta say, I didn't see this coming.
Jerguson seemed to be on the right road.
Where'd you find him? We, uh, we found him in a septic tank.
what?
did, uh, Benny have any issues that you noticed?
no. The guy was going to Bible study, had a job, wasn't fraternizing with any ex-cons from what I could tell.
well, someone sure had it out for him. Yeah. What kind of job did he get?
Benny was a repossession agent. Repo man.
it's a legit job. Ex-cons aren't exactly a first choice for most people.
did he have any, uh, parole violations? No.
only one incident on his last job report, but it checked out.
Yeah. It says his boss was being sued for $1. 2 million.
a woman felt endangered while he was repoing her car?
Ah, suits like that happen all the time. Which is a pretty good motive, wouldn't you say?
Dr. Fuentes, have you finished cataloguing the victim's injuries?
Yes. It is all in the binder as requested.
I would also like to be briefed on the investigation the FBI is conducting.
I will share the information necessary for the tasks I give you.
I hope I am not a threat to you.
I only wish to excel to make you look even better than you already do.
the injuries.
of course.
our victim had numerous injuries prior to death:
compound fractures to the left ribs, six through eight, as well as the sternum and left frontal, all indicating a beating or assault of some kind.
also a comminuted fracture on the left clavicle.
which... you missed.
inexcusable. I agree.
I must admit, your English is very good.
education was free in Cuba.
I knew which skills I would need once I defected.
well, it must have taken great courage to leave your home and start a new life here.
my grandfather, he fought for America at the Bay of Pigs.
he died horribly so that one day I would come to America and make many, many of the Benjamins.
I-I regret my previous error. But according to the injuries, our victim was beaten by a right-handed man wielding a blunt force weapon.
do you not agree?
it is a distinct possibility. I am redeemed.
what the hell is it you don't understand, bozo?
you didn't make your car payments. This is America.
you don't get something for nothing.
those were my wheels! You stole my wheels!
nobody steals my wheels. I ain't no thief. I am fully licensed, so take it up with the bank. I'm warning you...
no, I'm warning you.
you're trespassing. I'm counting to five and then
I'm gonna start tenderizing you. One, two, five! All right.
Hey, look at that. Nicely done.
hope you're not here to argue, cause I'm still pumping adrenaline.
FBI. Need to ask you a few questions about Benny Jerguson. Oh, crap.
is he back in jail? I thought he was going to make it.
no, Jerguson's dead, Ms. Grace, murdered.
damn.
I liked Benny.
man could jack a car a dozen ways, then drive away like a bat out of hell.
right. And you were sued for, what, over a million dollars on a repo job he did for you?
that was just a nuisance suit. You see this, uh, digital recorder?
I make all of my repo guys record every repossession.
that way, whenever I get sued, I'm not the one with her nuts in a vise.
right. Well, we'll need that recorder. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sure you would. The thing is that Benny had his own.
it wasn't on him? No, it wasn't on him.
see, the room he rented on that parole form, it was all cleared out.
well, that's 'cause he slept here most nights to save money. He only made $75 per job.
so, he lived here... still don't have the recorder?
you're not very trusting, are you, kiddo? No, not right now.
well, then screw you. Okay, well, in this line of work, you have to figure that there's someone out there who wanted to, I don't know, what, pound him?
there was this one jaghole. Clown named Graham something.
claimed Benny ruined his whole life when he jacked the guy's food truck, comes here with a big-ass knife. And you didn't think of that right away?
you need a nicer partner, you know that, honey?
right, okay, I'm gonna need all the paperwork you have on this Graham something.
sure. I got nothing to hide. Great.
Ah, you're right. I guess the food isn't too good.
but business is.
okay, you ready?
Hey, Graham.
I think I might know why you were so upset when your truck was repossessed.
do I know you? Nope.
now you do. FBI.
I have to ask you a few questions about your behavior when that happened.
okay. I mean, I was mad when they repoed my truck, but I paid what I owed. Case closed, right?
actually, no. The guy who took your truck wound up murdered.
Oh. Well, that's terrible, but what does that have to do with me?
you threatened him with a knife.
I-I lost my temper, but...
and you sell drugs. What?
lost your truck, lost your stash, right?
Yeah, maybe Benny found it, threatened to turn you in.
you guys are seriously reaching, huh?
reaching? Really? You recognize this guy over here?
this customer that you just sold a sandwich to. Oh-ho!
look at that, huh? He's with the FBI, too.
there are multiple Monteggia fractures on the victim's left ulna and radius.
a common injury when a victim is beaten and tries to defend himself.
however, they are not defensive, as you surmise.
these fractures occurred when his own body collided with his outstretched arm.
see how the injuries line up? As would happen in a car accident.
Yes. If our victim was in the driver's seat, a head-on collision not only explains the fractures to the ulna and radius, but all injuries which I attributed to the beating.
excellent work, Dr. Brennan.
you should be very proud.
you are not in a position to evaluate me.
I am your boss.
why are you smiling at me?
you and I, I sense tension.
I think soon we'll make love.
that will not be happening, Dr. Fuentes.
and if you would like to continue working here, you will not make that suggestion again.
of course. But it is a pity.
and it would also be a pity if you were sent back to Cuba for abusing the generous nature of this country.
perhaps I am suffering from loneliness of being in a new land.
I hope so. Now go over these bones again and determine why there is no head trauma from the steering wheel.
right away.
[ROYAL DINER] Food truck guy didn't do it. Oh, he has an alibi?
Graham was in Mexico replacing his stash.
you know, the video at the Border Patrol confirms that, so it backs up his story.
well, at least you were able to arrest him on possession with intent.
Yeah, you know what? He's gonna be out in a week.
so, what about you? Did you come up with anything?
progress is slower than I'd prefer.
I had a new intern forced upon me by the Secretary of State.
you mean, the real Secretary of State? Yes.
Dr. Fuentes is a defector from Cuba. Brilliant but arrogant.
mm, brilliant and arrogant. Must be tough to work with, huh?
it is. I-I know it is. I forgot to tell ya.
I was reading this really interesting article in the American Psychiatric Journal.
you were? Why?
me, why? I'm a lifelong learner.
anyway, in the article it was saying that research shows that going to church actually, uh, boosts your immune system, okay, decreases your blood pressure and reduces stress.
it's kind of like an antioxidant from God.
that's supposed to convince me that Christine should go to church?
I'm just, you know, concerned about the health of our child.
look, if that's not important to you... I can't believe you said that.
what? This is about science.
tell you what, I'll e-mail the article to you.
it's got all those big, fancy words in it that you love.
I also read a study which states that 86% of all holy water contains fecal matter.
all I'm saying is that if health is your argument,
I would pick filtered over holy.
I'll e-mail you that article.
all right, within the victim's torn clothes, I found aces of shore leaf pine, scarlet maple, and prickly ash.
all native to the woods near where the body was found.
which means his clothes were ripped on the foliage as he was running through the woods?
clearly he was chased. I would not rush to a conclusion.
Dr. Brennan doesn't like that. There's much she doesn't like.
answers, evidence, she likes those. Then I maintain my assertion that he was chased.
our victim had a compound fracture to the right fibula and shearing to the tibia from the fibula rubbing against it.
you think he could run on a compound fracture?
a release of adrenaline can make someone do extraordinary things.
based on the degree of bone damage, I estimate he ran for nearly a quarter mile.
only a desperate man being chased could endure such pain.
all right, I also found flakes of hunter-green paint on his shirt, and look at this.
a curved fragment of faux birch, most likely from the steering wheel.
based on the fractures to the ribs, ulna and radius, the car didn't have an air bag.
so, pre-1994.
the last thing I found was a shard of dual-paned glass from the windshield.
and it matches the profile of a manufacturer in South Korea.
which means we're looking for a Hyundai or a Kia.
one that crashed a quarter mile where the victim was found.
here, look, this is the car Benny was driving when he crashed.
holy crap.
it's a miracle he lived. He drowned in sewage.
right. I guess that's not a miracle. Was he repoing the car?
maybe the owner was chasing him. Not, it was registered to Benny.
so has the lab found anything in the car that could lead us to the killer?
no, they won't. The car was scrapped a week after it was found.
those photos are the only evidence we have.
were there any other tire tracks at the scene that could tie us to an assailant?
no, nothing. There were heavy rains, therefore, there were no footprints, there was no evidence of anyone at all.
we know that he was chased from the site of the accident and thrown in the septic tank. Yeah, but that's all we have.
he was probably forced off the road by whoever was chasing him.
is there enough detail in these photos to be valuable?
well, there will be, but the towing company used an 18-megapixel CMOS, which means I can work a little magic.
perhaps Hodgins can match the particulates to the damage.
and Dr. Fuentes should see how the damage to the car matches the fracture patterns.
I'll go get them. No, not yet.
I need a break from Dr. Fuentes.
I find him to be arrogant and conceited and preemptory.
you forgot hot. You are married, Angela.
don't tell me you haven't looked at that guy and thought that you...
this is not workplace conversation.
I'll take that as a yes. Angela, enlarge the driver's side of the car.
okay, I don't...
I don't see anything. What did you see?
nothing. Uh, I don't understand.
Benny was a great getaway driver.
so whoever was chasing him would have had to hit the car to run him off the road.
but why did he crash? The tox screen showed he wasn't drunk or stoned.
look at the front windshield.
there are two distinct webs of radial fracturing in the glass.
Benny wasn't alone in that car.
excuse me, Agent Booth.
officer Fowler. Come on in.
after we talked, I couldn't stop thinking about Benny.
I really thought he was someone who was gonna make it.
then I remembered this. What's this? Horatio Mancini?
Horatio grew up with Benny on the wrong side of Pennsylvania Avenue.
Benny's mother was a meth head, never knew who his father was.
Horatio became everything to him. Right.
so why didn't you mention this the last time we talked? I didn't think it was relevant.
Horatio got sent to jail the same time as Benny, only Benny got an early parole because he was cooperating with the warden.
apparently, Horatio was shaking down some of the other inmates.
so he ratted on Horatio in exchange for a shorter sentence? Yeah.
but because of overcrowding, Horatio got released early.
one week before Benny was killed.
the trajectory of abrasions to the ribs and transverse fracture to the sternum were caused by the steering wheel.
the victim was driving at the time of the accident.
you are restating an already established fact, Dr. Fuentes.
I'm setting the scene. Please, come. Come closer.
Vamos, vamos. Let us pretend that we are driver and passenger in the car.
I'll drive. Fine. I have no objection to you being killed.
in a typical accident, at point of impact, the driver would lurch forward, and we would find bilateral fractures in the left and right ulnae and radii.
however, on the victim, the fracturing occurred unilaterally on just the left side of the body.
meaning the victim was turned and reaching toward the passenger.
what-what are you doing? Reenacting the accident.
quite well, I thought. In that case, I will continue the reenactment.
and posit that the driver and the passenger were grappling with one another.
wait. A struggle would also explain the cause of the accident.
do you not agree, Dr. Fuentes? I do.
you have surprisingly great strength, Dr. Brennan.
I know. Is there anything else?
Yes. If you would let me up...
I found a comminuted fracture to the right fifth rib, inconsistent with the abrasion left by the steering wheel.
when Hodgins swabbed, he found traces of silicon, like that found in microprocessors.
the injuries had to be caused by something the victim was carrying, because they were localized on the rib.
very good.
please reexamine the ribs.
so, this guy, Horatio... he works parking cars at Bellamy's.
they probably didn't know that he was a car thief.
the new intern thought that he and I would be having sex.
Whoa! Whoa! What?!
sex. He thought we would have sex. Wait a second.
the Cuban guy?
all right, he flat out told you he wants to have sex with you?
Yes, he was quite brazen.
Whoa-oh. Although I imagine all of my male interns want to have sex with me.
uh... you do realize that you're talking out loud? What you just said there.
you're upset. You know I would never sleep with him.
well, you know what? You did tell me once that you thought that monogamy was unnatural.
Yes. That's true.
before I realized that we were symbiotic.
like a clown fish and a sea anemone. What?! What are you talking about, Nemo?
that doesn't sound very romantic. I disagree.
you and I, we're bound to one another.
so much so that I don't feel that I could survive without you.
you nurture me. You protect me. You are my home.
if I were to damage that by a meaningless dalliance, it would be like killing myself.
something that I would never do.
that sounded a little better.
I would never let anything compromise the life we share, Booth.
I love you. Okay, now that's romantic.
I love you, too. Come here. Come on, give us a little kiss.
I'm not gonna kiss you while you're driving.
hold the steering wheel, and give me a kiss.
I don't... Come on, you can do it.
hold it right there. You got it? I don't know if that's safe.
just go straight. You got to give me a kiss.
okay, you can't say that I'm not romantic now.
okay. Look at that! Teamwork! Oh!
compromise!
here you go, sir.
bones, Bones. That's Horatio.
a lot of beautiful cars. He must be quite happy here.
don't worry about the cars, huh? Horatio?
FBI. I need to ask you a few questions about Benny Jerguson.
Oh. Uh, you got the wrong guy. I'm Carlos, not Horatio.
everyone makes that mistake. Uh, Horatio's pulling up right now.
please, Bones, stay back. Bones, easy. No, no, no. Slow, slow.
what? Easy, easy. Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy!
just stay here, okay? No!
no, no...
Oh, oh, oh, easy, easy, easy, easy, okay? Just relax, just watch.
I got the gun. Just stay behind me.
I don't see him.
Hey, look out!
are you crazy?
Really? With the lettuce? Duck!
all right.
nothing more romantic than a man who can handle himself in the kitchen.
right.
how many times do I have to tell you I didn't kill Benny?
he was like a brother to me. A brother who turned on you in prison.
you got it wrong.
I told Benny to rat me out so he'd get an early release.
yo, he was getting beaten in prison every day. Shived once.
right. You're just a bighearted guy, right?
who just ran away and attacked a Federal agent.
I didn't run because of Benny.
you ran because you were downloading keyless entry systems to cars that you were supposed to be valeting.
we got it all off your smart phone. You were gonna steal those cars.
what? You're expecting a confession?
when was the last time you saw Benny? Right when I got out the joint.
but he came to me. And I told him to get lost.
"get lost"? This guy you thought of as your brother, you told him to "get lost"?
Yeah. 'Cause I knew he had a better chance without me.
I mean, Benny got a job, a real one. All on his own.
I was proud of him. I didn't want to mess that up.
because you knew you were going to keep stealing cars?
I know who I am, okay?
I wish I could change but some things are just the way they are.
but Benny... Benny had a ot.
he was talking about getting married, raising kids.
hmm. What did he want from you?
encryption codes to break into a BMW 7 Series.
I told him no, but he begged me. Said it's just one car.
I guess he wasn't gonna make it.
he was a good guy.
said he didn't have a choice.
you know, I told him, "Let me do it."
but he wouldn't let me. Said it'd be safer if I didn't get involved.
I should've went with him.
so this is everything you were able to get from the septic fluid?
everything made of silicone.
unfortunately this is just shattered substrate from a motherboard.
well, any clue what it used to be?
from this? This could be anything.
uh, cell phone, digital camera. Maybe even a toaster.
our best bet in recovering anything is to do a J-tag examination.
and by best bet, you mean...?
approximately slim to none.
for you.
from the right fifth rib. What is it?
appears to be a piece of a silicone chip.
which might help you in completing your puzzle.
wow, good job there, brother.
I couldn't have done it without all the support I get here.
part of that is the way you look.
it's not...just about the money.
my father always wanted me to defect.
he wanted this life for me.
he fought the government, was sent to prison three times.
I couldn't leave him there alone.
when he died...
my life here is for him.
my success? It-it will show my people what's possible.
well, he's tough to dislike. Even though you need to take a cold shower.
so, what you have here is every car theft report in Virginia in the past three months.
this is not really my job, Booth.
no, it is when the bureau is backlogged and there's budget cuts.
no, actually not. I'm trained to...
to catch the bad guys, okay?
if you don't pitch in to help catch the killer, he goes free and it's on your head.
now you're using guilt, Booth. That-that's beneath you.
no, not really. See, I'm all about results.
I'm a result-oriented guy. Okay, so Benny and Horatio went after the luxury brand models.
typically they'd go in the middle of the night, and they'd steal the car right out of the guy's garage.
what are there ones? What are the ones with the Post-its?
thefts that match Benny's M. O. Geez.
five in the past three months.
you're right, you know what? Benny wasn't reformed.
but look at the car he was driving, Booth.
it couldn't have been worth more than a grand, tops.
according to forensic accounting, he had no money saved up.
plus he was living in a repo yard.
what are you saying, all right? I know he stole those cars.
I'm not doubting your work, Booth. But something is off here, all right?
if Benny was actually stealing these high-end cars, why wasn't he making any money?
see, now that's what I do.
so, the good news is is that I was able to determine that the chip found in the septic sludge and in Benny's rib came from the same digital recorder.
his boss made him carry one. Yeah.
it was the same make she gave him.
now, I was able to run a full diagnostic. I transferred all the binary code.
but I was only able to retrieve this 11-second audio clip.
Nah, I can't do this no more.
I just want to work repo like I'm supposed to.
stealing cars ain't what I signed up for. Hey, what the hell you doing?!
get off! Get off of me!
Oh, God, we're gonna...
is there any audio of the person who's in the car with him?
no. None that comes through.
why would Benny record a conversation that could be incriminating?
maybe he thought it was the only way to get whoever was in that car with him to leave him alone.
I'm thinking it was his mentor Horatio. Or his boss who told him to record everything.
Nah, I can't do this no more. I just want to work repo like I'm supposed to.
stealing cars ain't what I signed up for. Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
get off! Get off of me!
Oh, God, we're gonna...
why you make me listen to that?
I already said Benny getting killed is a damn shame.
I can see you're overwhelmed with grief. You know what?
I didn't like you the second I saw you. And you're just getting uglier by the minute.
come on, I looked into your finances.
you're, like, two months max from going out of business.
that's because the economy's in recovery, ain't you heard?
which is fine and dandy for the rest of the country.
but for us in the repo game? Recovery sucks.
why'd you hire Benny? You never hired a felon before.
christian charity a crime now?
see, I think you hired him because you knew you can manipulate him into making you some extra cash on the side.
but he wanted out... Excuse me.
you hear my voice on that tape? You knew he had the recorder on him.
you were smart enough not to talk. You know what?
I am smart enough to know when to shut my trap.
and I'm shutting it right now.
you have a delicate touch.
I would prefer to be alone while I work.
is the problem with me, or in your lack of discovery?
agent Booth has a suspect, but so far, we don't have enough physical evidence to arrest her.
I see.
when I was... in Cuba, in charge of my own facility,
I too would often, um...
Oh... como se dice?
...Let the bones speak to me.
you are delusional if you think an inanimate object can speak.
I'm sorry. That shouldn't have happened.
coming from a land of atheists, I wouldn't expect you to be a religious man, Dr. Fuentes.
I am an atheist. This was my father's.
his religion was taken from him and his parents, driven underground... It was very painful to them. But if you don't believe...
I believe in the right to believe. That's what this means.
eventually, we all make our own choices.
but we can't make good decisions unless we are exposed to everything.
can we?
have I said something wrong?
no.
you are quite right.
can you hand me that scapula, Dr. Fuentes?
but you already examined it.
as have I.
unfortunately, there is nothing more to be learned from these bones.
you are correct.
which is why we have to look at another set of remains.
but these are the only remains we have.
aren't they?
Dr. Brennan!
Dr. Brennan!
so far, we have only concentrated on the injuries found on the victim.
what we failed to consider were the fractures the killer must have sustained.
that's brilliant. But you already know that.
based on the damage done to the car,
I extrapolated the speed to be approximately 25 miles per hour on impact.
from the unilateral fracturing to the left side of the body, we know the victim was facing the killer.
and likely struggling with her. Which means the killer was also facing the victim.
okay.
and what about seat belts? On the windshield, radial fracturing suggests that the killer's head made contact.
okay, so no seat belts.
all right, you ready?
okay. I am always buckling up.
these injuries represent the minimal amount of fracturing that could be sustained to a healthy adult passenger.
possible fractures to the right side of the body, frontal bone, ribs, ulna and radius.
I've seen these before, in Cuba, since so many of our cars have no air bags.
but a month has gone by.
it's not likely Georgia Grace would exhibit any outward signs of having been in an accident.
and yet, underneath her skin, the bone could still be remodeling.
there could be some debris imbedded under her flesh or even in bone.
meaning that if we got an X ray of the killer, then we got her. Yes.
georgia Grace volunteered to get X-rayed. She's clean.
what about Horatio? Nothing.
you got something? I don't know.
I'm probably reaching, but... okay.
I was rereading, uh, the parole officer's notes, um, 'cause I wanted to understand Benny's state of mind before he was murdered, right?
[SPECIAL AGENT S. BOOTH] Right. So that's good, you have something, then.
maybe. Do you have the list of the cars that you suspect Benny stole?
um... list of cars...
right here. List. Okay.
what are the dates that they were stolen?
uh, March 3, March 8,
may 23rd.
okay, maybe I wasn't reaching.
all of those days correspond to the dates that Benny met with his parole officer.
that's it. Fowler forced Benny to steal those cars.
and if he didn't, he threatened to throw him back into jail.
exactly. And he knew that if Benny got caught, it would all come down on Benny, not him.
it was a sweet scam. Fowler is not gonna get away with this.
no. You don't have enough proof to arrest him, Booth.
Plus, he's smart enough not to submit to an X ray.
I don't have to arrest him, I just have to bring him in and ask him a few questions.
bones, I need your help.
officer Fowler.
thanks for coming in. Appreciate it.
Oh. Sure. You get some new information?
Yeah, pieces of the puzzle, you know, you understand.
the tough part is putting it all together. Yeah, well, whatever I can do.
like I said, I... it's tough to lose a guy I was responsible for.
I can only imagine. Yeah.
sorry about going through security, but even us good guys gotta do it.
at least I don't have to take my shoes off. Ooh, that would stink.
the backscatter X-ray is low resolution, so there's very little detail.
that's fine.
you got him?
the radiation just reflects off the target, it doesn't pass through.
look, I just need a yes or a no, Bones.
I need another pass. Then maybe I can enhance it.
Hey, Agent Booth, what's the problem here?
Oh, a technical thing, right, with the machine?
you know these government issue things. Okay, well, my badge should be enough.
just relax, we'll be right with you.
I'm using a program Angela developed.
it decreases statistical noise and increases resolution.
all right, so he's clean? Wait.
there's faint evidence of fracturing along the coronal suture.
and Dr. Fuentes was right. There's metal and glass imbedded in the scalp.
Dr. Hodgins can match it to the make and model of the car.
Hey, what the hell is going on? They won't let me out of here.
okay, no, just let him out. Thanks.
sorry about that. Yeah, no worries.
Hey, turn around. What-what are you doing?
you're under arrest for murder. What?
you've got it wrong. You murdered Benny Jerguson,
officer Fowler. I don't get things wrong.
I really appreciate you coming down here and helping us out. Really means a lot.
you really were a big help.
what a wonderful aroma. Oh.
what are you doing in here? Oh, man.
I wanted it to be a surprise, after you finished your paperwork.
come.
voila. No...
ropa vieja. Yeah.
I had to improvise a little bit, but luckily a double-neck boiler is perfect for sous vide.
smells just like my father's. So I read up on the dish.
as you know, ropa vieja means "old clothes.
well, the name comes from an old wives' tale.
a poor man must cook a meal for his whole family...
only he has nothing to serve. So he gathers up his old clothes, imbues them with love, and they miraculously turn into stew.
the family is fed. Yeah.
I thought it might be a nice way to welcome you to our little family.
listen, I know you want to be an American now, but I figured you might miss a few things.
well...
you know, if I could've stayed, I would.
it's my home.
and it will be again, one day.
well, until then...
until then, I will become a famous and rich American.
and be grateful for my new friend, who, just for a moment, has brought me home.
Cheers. Salud.
no, no...
okay.
Christine is out.
she's sleeping like an angel.
did you call her an angel because you want her to go to church?
what? No.
I called her an angel because she is one.
I think she should go. What?
Christine. To church.
Really? Whoa, whoa.
wait a second, now. Why?
because she can.
while I personally don't believe in God, myths can have a very beneficial effect on children.
what if she doesn't think it's a myth? Well, she is my daughter, Booth.
I trust her to come to a rational decision once she has all the information.
wow, who would've thought, huh? Compromise.
I look at it as an exercise in freedom.
you're not saying this because of, uh, Dr. Cuba?
a bit, yes.
he asked you to sleep with him again? No.
I'm sure he still wants to.
but as long as I have you... Uh-huh.
I would, however, also like to take Christine to the Natural History Museum on Sundays after church.
is that the place with the dinosaurs? Yeah.
who wouldn't want to go there, right? She's gonna love my T rex imitation.
oh-ho, Mrs. Cavewoman,
I'm gonna pick you up with my tiny, little arms in my tiny, little hands!
you can't tell Christine that early man and dinosaurs coexisted.
Mrs. Flintstone, you have no choice.
T. rex attacks, right there... We're gonna wake up Christine!
it's like the post-apocalyptic future down here.
Brenda, relax. The soup kitchen is just on the next block.
there have to be easier ways to spice up a college application.
it's all about community service. Colleges don't care about test scores anymore.
couldn't we have picked a less creepy community?
whoa, Brenda, do you see that?
there's a guy over there in the storm drain.
he looks stuck. Help me get this stuff out of the way.
Seriously? Do you want to go to Harvard or not?
sir, are you okay? Does he look okay, Brenda?
sir, we're going to get you out. Grab the other side and pull.
you're right. This is going to make an awesome college essay.
how long have you been up? Oh, not too long.
I just wanted to read this new piece on the Flyers.
I'm telling you, Hextall's gonna win us the Cup this year.
you didn't sleep again, did you? I was, uh, it was in and out.
I was probably just, you know, getting used to this new house and all.
booth, you haven't slept well in a long time.
I'm worried that something is wrong. You were falsely accused.
you were in prison. You've been through a lot.
well, so have you. Not as much as you.
sweets would say that you have avoidance issues.
Oh, avoidance issues. What?
you're still not trusting the people you work with.
I'm concerned you're not dealing with the trauma you suffered.
listen, Sweets has passed away, okay? God bless his soul.
and you know what? You don't even believe in psychology.
right? You know what, I...
let's not talk about this now. Please?
all right, look, I'll sleep when I'm tired. But for now, I'm gonna make you pancakes.
I know you've missed my pancakes.
Yes, you have. Pancakes coming up.
booth...
yeah... Right, right, okay.
Ooh... on our way. Sure.
well, it looks like someone is sleeping the big sleep.
so much for the pancakes. They found a body under the bridge in Garfield Heights.
I'll get Christine ready for day care.
the victim was found by a couple of high school kids who didn't realize the guy was dead because weasels were making the body move.
whoa, they must've freaked out. - Actually, one was pumped.
said something about it being what she needed to get into Harvard? These trusty hands are all yours.
put me to work. Aubrey, what are you doing here?
well, you know, I was in the neighborhood and I heard the call, so I sort of figured I'd stop by-- holy crap!
Oh, man...
Oh, my God. Where's the other half of him?
that's the worst thing I've ever seen. - Really?
I'd only give this about a 7. 5. - I'd give this a six.
you know, the floaters are much worse.
Yeah, well, you know, give me a nice, clean gunshot any day.
it seems you're not familiar with the explosive nature of a head wound.
okay, okay, hazing the new guy. It's really funny.
so what the hell happened here?
the victim got stuck in the drain and animals ate the half they had access to.
I could see how he got stuck. He was obese.
well, half of him still is obese.
blunt surface of the orbital margins indicates the victim is male, Caucasian.
well, the inside of the pants confirms the male part.
Ooh, wait a sec. This is not an accident.
look at the bottom of his soles. - Totally clean.
didn't walk here on his own. It's a body dump.
or an attempt at one, at least.
I found our ravenous little culprits! - Oh. Rats.
never been a fan. - Rats?
don't embarrass yourself, Aubrey.
these are stoats, aka short-tailed weasels.
anyone have time of death for me?
uniformity in scoring on the cortical surface suggests the stoats are the lone scavengers.
and given the level of predation, I'd say three days.
I'm gonna see what else I can find.- Three days.
his pants are pricey. This is high-quality gabardine.
Yeah.
and his shoes are Italian. Expensive leather.
well, look, the big question is what was Daddy Warbucks doing down here?
could've been buying drugs. Wouldn't be the first time in this neighborhood.
found it! I found the stoats' den.
and... ...it is filled with evidence. - Yeah, music to my ears.
Yeah, no, lucky for us, the stoat actually lines his den with the remains of his prey.
is that his...?
hair? Yeah.
and those are phalanges.
and an eyeball.- Oh, God, it's his tongue.
Yes. Very observant, Mr. Aubrey.
thank you. Oh, man... there's one still inside.
Oh, God... and he's eating...
he's eating, oh, man. - Yeah.
it's a fun job, right?
on the lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, I'm seeing numerous osteophytes.
a common skeletal injury for the morbidly obese.
note the perimortem fractures to the nasal bones.
and also the anterior dentition, the upper left central incisor and the lateral incisor.
that would suggest a hard blow from a right-handed assailant.
but not hard enough to be fatal.
before we continue, I would like to... offer my condolences.
Dr. Sweets was a good man. - Yes, he was.
he was a very good man. Colleagues can be like family.
I had an assistant in Habana, and like Sweets, he was like a brother.
guys, can we please not talk about Sweets right now?
if we do, we're going to start crying and contaminate the evidence.
booth thinks it's odd, but I find relief when analyzing decomposed remains.
Yes, Booth is correct. All right, my sartorial work is finished.
this guy is ready to go freestyle.
discoloration to the scrotum. Likely from trauma.
looks like our killer fought dirty.
ms. Montenegro, it is so good to see you again.
you too, Rodolfo. What?
he's eye candy. Just deal with it.
are you here just to gawk or did you finish your reconstruction?
uh, well, the skull was relatively unscathed, but before I add dimension to the face,
I do need an estimate of the victim's weight.
based on the measurement of the bi-iliac breadth, as well as the femoral head, I'd say 136 kilograms.
so... factoring in the weight...
Oh, no. It's that guy.
the blowhard. - Is "blowhard" some kind of a job?
he was a talk radio host who was ignorant and angry.
it's a lethal combination. - Well, it certainly was for him.
hutch Whitehouse? He's the victim?
Yeah, do you know him? - Yeah.
his fans are called Hutchheads. He's, like, a big-time conservative talk show host.
went to UVA before dropping out to become a top 40 DJ.
now he's a right-wing icon, syndicated nationwide to the tune of $10 million a year.
he's pro-guns, pro-capital punishment, pro-vouchers, anti-immigrant, anti-choice, anti...
Wow. You really know your Hutch. - Nah, I just did a background check online.
I really want on this case.
why, because it's a high profile case? - Yeah.
and because he almost made me throw up. His remains.
Aubrey, just put the football down and go back to your desk.
and, uh, one more thing. Uh, his wife of 15 years, Miriam, is waiting in the conference room.
okay, all right, you know what? I'll go talk to her, you hold on to that.
I could come, too. - Nope, nope. I'm fine.
are you sure? You handpicked me, remember?
and Sweets agreed that... - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second.
okay, I picked you to work for me, okay?
not to be my partner. Let's not get that confused.
you know, me being here isn't the reason Sweets is gone.
I-I need to go talk to this suspect, okay?
so you just put that right up on the wall up there.
you say he was killed three days ago? - Well, approximately.
see, the Jeffersonian, they're still trying to be a little bit more specific.
so, um... You never reported him missing.
you didn't say anything to the authorities. - Hutch and I......lately, we've led separate lives.
all right, so you were getting a divorce. - No.
God, no.
just... busy.
hutch had his show, and I promote women's rights issues all over the country.
I was in Charlotte three days ago.
so you and Hutch weren't on the same political wavelength.
on some issues we were, and some we weren't.
isn't that the way it's supposed to be?
supposed to be, huh?
searching for a motive.
I understand.
I also stand to come into quite a lot of money now that Hutch is gone. - Yeah, you do.
$30 million worth, according to this contract.
some people value their relationship more than money. - You're right.
so can you think of anyone who'd want to hurt your husband?
half the people who listened to his show probably wanted him dead.
right, he was offensive.
you should talk to Bob Gordon, his producer.
and Alan, his co-host. They kept track of all the crazies.
had to, for insurance reasons.
all the damage I found on the upper half of his remains is superficial.
so you think cause of death must be south of the border? - Yes.
unfortunately, I cannot clean the bones until you are done testing the urine.
that is correct, Dr. Fuentes. So unless you want to test the urine yourself...
no, gracias.
okay. So the first sample came back negative for drugs, alcohol, no poisons... - Look at his cortisol level.
that can't be right. When someone's attacked, their cortisol levels spike.
it's a direct response to stress. And his oxytocin levels are up.
it's like he was enjoying being murdered.
everyone's talking about voter reform. How about this?
you don't speak English, you don't vote. - Oh.
and those kids sneaking in?
they grow up. If we starve them out now, no problem in the future.
there are simple solutions, citizens. More guns, not less.
celebrate diversity?
how about celebrate our own kind? Huh?
whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut that crap off, will you?
man, that's horrible. - I was hoping you'd say that.
well, what do you know about his producer? - Well, his name is Bob Gordon.
and he's a mega-billionaire. Like the one percent of the one percent.
he's also a big-time donor to all the conservative super PACs.
did he have any beef with Hutch? - No reason to.
hutch was the golden goose. He brought in hundreds of millions in ad revenue.
he does have a record though. Two DUI's.
one arrest for hunting deer without a license... while intoxicated. - Great.
so drunk, armed and dangerous. What about Hutch's on-air partner?
alan Spaziano. He was Hutch's on-air punching bag.
hutch called him a Demo-crap, one of his go-to jokes.
does he have a record? - No.
Spaziano's so clean, he's practically Canadian.
clean but humiliated. Sounds like a suspect to me.
Yeah. Thanks for bringing me along, Agent Booth.
I really appreciate it. - You should.
how many times do I have to say it till it gets through that thick, commie skull of yours that when you're fired, it means you don't work here anymore?
I can do the show on my own, Bob.
I don't need Hutch! - There's no money in liberal talk, Alan.
there's no money in liberal talk, Alan.
and I should know 'cause all I care about is money.
it depends on who's - doing the talking, Bob. - Okay, break it up.
the two of you, just get to your corners there and stop finger-pointing at each other. FBI.
we've got a few questions we'd like to ask about Hutch.
you're the producer? - Yeah. Bob Gordon.
when's the last time either one of you heard from Hutch?
three days ago. Early morning, Hutch calls in, leaves some boo-hoo message on my cell that he's feeling sick.
so, you're the compassionate type? Listen, two months ago, I gave Hutch a mega deal.
ever since, he's been acting like a complete diva.
I went to his house to drag his butt out of bed, only he wasn't there.
okay, great. Do you still have that voice mail?
I deleted it.
you deleted it! Well, that's pretty convenient.
okay, well, I'll tell you what.
why don't you hand over your phone so we can help retrieve those messages for you?
you ever hear of the Fourth Amendment? Yeah, it helps with people who have something to hide.
we can get a warrant, pull it off your cell company's servers.
I thought the government didn't bother with warrants anymore.
they just spy on whoever they want.
you-- Hutch's hobby was to humiliate you, huh?
use you as a punching bag. - Hutch was just playing a part.
he doesn't believe half of what he's saying. - The show is dead and so is your career.
Yeah. Not much of a motive, is it?
what about enemies outside of the station?
his wife said you had to keep a record for the insurance company.
Yeah. Be my guest.
those are just the credible threats.
knock yourselves out. People really hated him.
Yeah, what can I say? The man was a star.
Dr. Fuentes? I hear you have something of interest to show me?
I'm still cleaning the southern half of the victim, but I want you to take a look at the radius, scaphoid and trapezium.
perimortem ligature marks. The victim was bound at time of death.
I also found some bilateral microfracturing on the hyoid. He was strangled.
although the pressure wasn't sufficient to be fatal.
so, still no cause of death. No.
but I have seen injuries like these before.
in Habana I was told to obscure evidence like this...after the Rapid Response Brigades would interrogate a prisoner.
the secret police.
Yes. Another reason why I defected.
these lacerations to the wrists, plus the strangulation and the repeated strikes to the genitals...
the victim was tortured prior to death.
Yes. But what was it they wanted to know?
Wow. All these boxes are filled with threatening letters to the victim?
Yeah, Booth read over everything looking for potential suspects.
booth? Booth read through all this?
Hey, I tried to help, but apparently Booth's trust doesn't extend that far.
these are the letters he thought stood out. And these are all from the same guy?
Yeah. I took a quick glance. I agree with Booth.
dude was obsessed with Hutch. Each letter rants against something he said on his show.
so, an angry liberal? - You'd think, but no.
radical conservative. Thought Hutch was too soft.
from the postmark, I was able to determine which post office picked up the letter.
so, it was somewhere in this area.
did you cross-reference that with individuals with criminal records?
I did.
Yikes, 78 names.
remind me not to walk in that neighborhood at night.
Yeah, all the letters had pretty basic grammar and punctuation, sloppy penmanship.
Yeah, probably no more than a high school education.
okay, well, when I eliminate the college graduates,
I'm left with a list of 45 names.
Oh, we can get that number down because the king has arrived.
I found some trace on the reverse side of a couple of the letters. I put it up on the server.
this guy's anger actually worked well for us.
he pushed so hard with his pen that the paper picked up particulates from the writing surface below.
asbestos, PCB and lead.
meaning he is living in a building which should be condemned. Thank you, thank you.
hold the coronation, Your Majesty. - All right.
okay, just look up buildings in the area which failed inspection.
wow, okay.
arrested two years ago for assaulting a Muslim with a baseball bat.
all hail the king, baby. King of the lab!
Oh, boy. I had a local black and white confirm that Byers is home.
Yeah, me, too. Heading there now. - Oh, I'll just be a sec.
no, no, no. Taking Bones.
but the guy's a psycho. He could be dangerous.
what? You don't think I can take care of myself?
what? No! But I could help.
I get it that it's tough to trust somebody new. But I thought we were really starting to get along.
right. That's good. That is good.
why don't you let things just, uh, run their course, okay?
sure.
if Byers is dangerous, why didn't you bring Agent Aubrey as backup?
he's a good agent, isn't he? Look...
Aubrey is fine, okay? But you, you are my partner.
your world has to be bigger than just you and me, Booth.
it is, all right? I'm back to work, aren't I?
well, objectively that's true. But you still don't seem to trust anyone.
and you have to, to do this job. - I trust you.
then listen to me. Sweets said that you have to believe in something again, something bigger than yourself.
I do. My family.
you haven't been to church since you've been released.
you don't even believe in God. - But you do.
and you used to believe that people were good.
and they deserve to be trusted. Look, Bo-- let's not, not now, all right, Bones?
not when we're about to go after a murder suspect.
look, I love you, but you really have no idea what you're talking about.
I made a professional call with Aubrey, that's it. I am fine.
FBI, Mr. Byers. Open up!
I don't think he can hear you, Booth. The music is at least 85 decibels.
if it's safe enough not to bring Aubrey， - Just，- it's safe enough to enter.
just stay behind me, you understand?
Mr. Byers? FBI.
your door was unlocked.
the music is horrible. Mr. Byers?
Oh, Booth?
he's ordering fertilizer. He's making a bomb.
what the hell are you doing here?
all right, hold it right there. FBI.
whoa, whoa, whoa, all right. All right, easy.
come on. - Booth,
easy. Easy. All right.
I do not recognize your authority.
so we found your manifesto in your apartment.
I tell you, there's a lot of misspelled words in there.
so now the problem's believing in the white race?
when it's all the foreigners that are coming in here and destroying the country.
is that who you were gonna make the bombs for? You got to open your eyes, man.
the Mexicans are coming in here, taking our jobs.
the blacks, all of 'em on drugs. - What about Hutch Whitehouse?
the traitor?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, he talks a good game.
but when I wanted him to spread the word about the armed uprising, you know what he did?
he slithered off like a little garter snake.
so he doesn't deserve to live， much less be the spokesman.
which is probably why he was murdered three days ago, right?
God works in mysterious ways, doesn't He?
he sure does. So did you do it?
did you murder him? Did you kill him?
let me tell you something, I ain't a coward like Hutch.
so, yeah, I admit it. I did it.
and everybody's gonna know my name.
so you can let everybody know that that's the future that they have if they don't support white America.
you tortured him. - He begged for mercy, and I didn't give him none.
just finished him off, you cut his head clean off.
that's-that's right. That's how you send a message.
that's how you create a name for yourself.
you got it. You got it.
I took him by his fat neck and I sliced deeper and deeper.
Hey, where you going? Where you going?
Hey, you know what, you're lying, okay? He wasn't decapitated.
S-So, wait, you just gonna... y-you gonna...just gonna let me... let me go? - No.
no, I mean, you were gonna make a fertilizer bomb.
you're just a pure white terrorist who's going to jail for a long, long time, and I'm gonna make sure that no one ever knows your name.
Dr. Brennan.
what, Dr. Fuentes?
I-I was concentrating on the radius.
we're positing torture, but...look at the damage to the radius.
Mmm. I see what you mean.
compared to what I've seen in Cuba, the damage is relatively slight. - So...
we're looking for a compassionate torturer? - And look at the pelvis.
there's evidence of calcification. Which would suggest that he had been hit in the cojones before.
based on the topography of the calcification, I'd say multiple times in the last year.
that might explain his low cortisol levels.
if he'd been tortured before, he could become accustomed to the pain.
look. Look at the ligature marks on the victim's wrists.
calcification of the scaphoid and trapezium.
he was tortured. But it was his choice.
so he was into S and M?
Yes. He enjoyed it.
booth asked me to look into Hutch's finances.
I found a lot of big cash withdrawals on the nights he wasn't home.
for his dominatrix. - Well, S and M is hip now apparently.
50 Shades of Grey is outselling Harry Potter.
hutch, h-he was a public figure. I just...
I can't see him doing the deed at home or in a hotel or someplace where he has no control.
Oh, you're good. Give me a sec.
but for some reason he spent six grand to soundproof it.
looks like we found ourselves a sex dungeon.
you want to tell Booth or should I?
no, you call him. It should come from someone he trusts.
it's creepy, right?
I mean, sex is about love, not being tied up and beaten.
I disagree. - What?
sex and violence are two of humanity's most primal urges.
an amalgamation of them is a logical by-product.
bones, S and M isn't a peanut butter cup. It's not two great tastes that go together.
you enjoy being bitten.
bi... No, I don't.
when we make love, sometimes I nibble your ear.
your response is very positive to say the least.
look, a nibble is a lot different an being whipped.
all degrees of the same thing.
look, I think the inquisition, you know, would've been a lot different with nibbling, if you ask me.
whoa, look at this place.
you could perform Cirque Du Soleil in here.
there are many possible murder weapons.
whips, chains, nipple clamps, Luna beads...
Ah, you sound excited there, Bones.
Wha... I'm fascinated, as a scientist.
right. Okay.
you know, I can probably get to two shades of Grey, but I'm not gonna be making 50.
I'll tell you that. - There should be something here that could give us cause of death.
look at this in the chair, it looks like dried blood. - This could potentially be where he was murdered.
definitely blood.
I'm seeing a lot of bodily fluid, as well.
no surprise there. Everywhere, Booth.
they must have been having sex as well. At least he got something out of it.
no, with the damage to his testicles, the sex would have caused even more pain.
right, right. Okay.
well, if the dominatrix's DNA is on file, you know, I can bring her in.
this is a recreation of the victim.
okay, can we move close into the victim's skull?
okay.
now, I reevaluated the cracked dentition and nasal bone fractures I found earlier.
originally, I thought that it was the result of multiple strikes.
you think a single strike did all this damage? - I hope so.
now, it was so much easier in Cuba when we could just make up the evidence we needed.
but since we don't have that luxury, please put a ball gag into the victim's mouth.
Yeah. Uh...
a ball gag...
it's a common piece of S and M paraphernalia, but it wasn't at his office.
I know what a ball gag is, I just don't have the graphic in my system.
Oh. How strange.
what about a golf ball? - What about a squash ball?
that is a much more accurate facsimile.
Oh, yeah. That's a great idea.
we had a guy die on a squash court once-- so that's perfect.
I mean, it's not perfect. But it's... it's helpful for...Yeah. ...this.
okay, squash-ball gag.
now, simulate a strike to the victim's face.
we don't yet have a murder weapon, but it's got to be something flat and hard, like a piece of tile, but with enough force to fracture the nasal bone.
okay. But it's not gonna be enough to kill him.
Oh. But, look, it did kill him.
the nasal bone fractures caused the victim's nose to swell and obstruct the airway.
right. Yes.
and with his nose swollen shut and the ball gag in his mouth, he would have suffocated.
we found cause of death. - But wait.
why wouldn't the dominatrix have removed the ball gag and saved his life?
so, Ms. Skarsgard, we found your DNA in Hutch Whitehouse's...what is it-- dungeon?
I'd call it a fantasy space. And of course you found my DNA there.
I'm not a housekeeper. It was Hutch's job to clean up.
Oh, fantasy space? Right.
last year you were arrested on assault charges.
an angry wife. I was defending myself.
well, two angry wives, it says here. Wow, you really have a penchant for violence.
agent Booth, I'm a dominatrix.
if the rough stuff bothered me, I wouldn't be fit to do my job.
both charges were dropped, by the way.
right, maybe not this time. - What is this about?
is Hutch pressing charges or something? - No, Hutch is dead.
he choked on his ball gag after being smashed in the face.
Oh, my God. -You really thought you could get away with it, huh?
you think that...
no. This would not happen on my watch.
I'm a professional.
Oh, a professional. What, do you guys have some kind of a union?
I'm a licensed therapist. I provided a safe, reliable service.
right, so you were his, um... ...therapist? - Yes.
hutch felt great guilt that he made his money inciting the worst in people.
Oh, and your beatings helped him with that? - I never beat him.
he was disciplined, which fulfilled his need to feel punished.
making progress, too. I can't believe he's dead.
progress? Wow, what-what kind of progress were you making?
hutch was thinking of quitting his show, becoming a moderate, a voice of reason.
agent Booth, I swear, when I left him he was fine.
he could have released himself whenever he wanted to.
when you left him-- well, you left him bound and gagged.
abandonment was important to Hutch.
but the handcuffs and restraints I used had safety releases.
it was up to him to decide when he had had enough.
I would never harm a client.
both distal tibias and fibulas indicate he visited this woman quite frequently.
I should have ruled out torture much earlier.
both of us were deceived by the evidence.
now Booth needs more evidence to tie the dominatrix to the crime.
of course. How is your husband?
because Booth and I are fine. - No.
not at all. I just know the effects of trauma.
my brother was betrayed by the police he worked with. Like Booth.
I'm sorry, I... I assumed you were... - Oh, please.
you're beautiful, I'm handsome, misunderstandings like this are common between people such as us.
true.
what happened to your brother?
so he accepted the basic principles of quantum physics.
he knows nothing of physics.
but he accepted the basic principles of the Callan-Symanzik equation, which states that expectations will fail in a quantum world.
thank you for that, Dr. Fuentes. - I'm not sure what I did.
there's a tendon fiber imbedded in the tibia.
I also found a gap in the cortical bone near where the tendon attaches.
the victim was pulled at the extremities by a device like a rack.
did you find any such device in the victim's S and M retreat? - No.
which suggests perhaps he was seeing more than one dominatrix.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, okay.
right, thanks. Yeah, that was Bones.
She-she was saying that the, uh, the body was, uh, stretched or something.
you know? But it couldn't have happened in that room.
you know, maybe it was... was, uh, another dominatrix. - Yeah, or his wife.
no, no, not the wife. She was out of town.
Yeah, but I talked to the front desk clerk at the hotel in Charlotte where she was staying when he was killed.
and the alibi-- did it stick? Yes and no.
uh, we should bring her in. And when we do, I want to be there for the interrogation.
Oh, you want to be there? Well, you can't always get what you want.
that's a Rolling Stones song. You should keep playing that in your head over and over again.
you are an idiot, you know that?
excuse me? - Do you really think you're gonna do better than me?
you should get out while you can. - Look, I know that what happened to you is messed up.
and then what happened to Sweets.
but remember that Sweets trusted me to work with you.
so when you treat me like crap, you're treating Sweets like crap, too.
here's everything I got from talking to the hotel.
good luck with the wife.
I don't know what the fuss is all about... so I requested a ground floor room at my hotel. Lots of people do that.
right, but they usually don't threaten the front desk until they get that room.
why was that so important? - I did not kill my husband.
Oh, no, you just wanted a room right near the exit, right?
so, what, you could sneak out, go to the movies and come back without anyone knowing?
I was in that hotel room all night long. - That doesn't clear you, you know?
if you were seeing another man, you're gonna want your husband dead.
I was not having an affair. That's how Hutch dealt with his problems.
I tried to help him so that he wouldn't have to get slapped around or whatever it was that he did.
so you know about the dominatrix? - I know that Hutch was miserable.
he hated the work he was doing. I tried to help him, but all he wanted was her.
anger. Another motive.
that night...I was dealing with things my way.
I needed that room so that I could buy drugs without anyone seeing me.
it would've ruined Hutch if I got caught.
drugs? Okay, I'm gonna need the name of that dealer.
I don't know his name. And it wouldn't matter if I did, because I don't have an alibi.
not until 8: 00 a. m. the next morning. You have to believe me.
I have a problem. - Yes, you have a problem.
and you have a big problem.
I reevaluated the tears to the victim's tibias and fibulas.
the ones we thought were caused by stretching?
Yes. The problem I discovered was the lack of resistance from any of the surrounding tendons or cartilage.
I thought it was because he was unconscious.
even unconscious, the body exhibits an involuntary resistance to injury.
which is what I explained to the good doctor. He had to be dead for the injuries to occur.
so the stretching was caused when his body was moved under the bridge for disposal.
dragging wouldn't have caused the injury. But suspending him would, if he was upside down with his full weight pulling his tendons taut.
so how does someone move a man the size of a small elephant?
well, I went back and I checked our victim's socks and the cuffs on his pants.
he really is quite brilliant. - As are you, Doctor.
thank you. - I'm waiting.
right, right. So I found animal hair.
some weasel, but mostly white tail deer, which at first was confusing, 'cause I thought, Bambi, why are you an accomplice to a murder?
of course. The killer used a deer hoist to move the victim.
that's right. - What is a deer hoist?
it, uh... Hunters use them in order to hang and transport the deer that they've shot.
but now we got to figure out who uses... - We already have.
hutch Whitehouse's producer is a deer hunter.
so we recovered Hutch's blood from your truck.
I'm a hunter, there's no secret about that. If you found blood, it would have been deer blood.
I loved Hutch.
based on your views of climate change, I know that science is not your forte, but trust me, the blood work is incontrovertible.
well, maybe, uh, someone took my truck. It was the middle of the night.
you seriously want to go with that?
cause the prosecutor is gonna make your life a living hell if you go with that story, pal.
fine.
I admit it. I did it.
I disposed of the body, but I did not kill Hutch.
why would I? - Why? Because Hutch was gonna quit.
okay, and he wasn't following your little party line.
please. There never was any party line.
that was just a way of making money.
hutch would have been a damn Bolshevik if it paid well enough.
so would I. - Oh, that gives you a good motive.
you were going to lose advertisers. - So I'm guilty of being a money-grubbing hypocrite.
if that's against the law, then, throw me in jail, throw away the key, but everything else that I told you was the truth.
after I got his message, went to his house. Have it out with him... verbally.
but he wasn't there. So I called Miriam.
wait a second. You talked to his wife?
Yeah. She told me about his other place.
and that is where I found him. Dead.
handcuffs, leather, ball gag. It was revolting.
I could not let the cops
because it would have destroyed your station. -Yeah.
so you dressed him in his regular clothes and took him to the storm drain.
how was I supposed to know that he wouldn't fit?
again, science and math would have helped you a great deal.
okay, so the producer told us he threw these down another storm drain.
the good news is, the bag was tied shut, so the evidence is pristine.
there's lots of blood on this stuff.
probably from Hutch, but I can see if any of it came from the killer.
Oh, there's a shard of something imbedded in the ball gag.
may I? - Mm-hmm.
it's a splinter from a fractured upper left central incisor.
wow, it would have taken a lot of force to break it off and imbed it in the bone.
more than a blow from a fist? - I believe so, yes.
I am going to measure the width of the shard, and perhaps we can build a profile of the weapon.
7. 5 millimeters.
and the ancillary fractures,I determined the length of what struck him was 123 millimeters.
so, he was hit with something roughly the size of a pack of cards?
let me see the tooth. Looks like there's some kind of trace on it.
Yeah, there's, like, an accumulation of textile fibers.
lint. It's simpler to say lint.
right. Okay, so we're looking for something hard enough to crack bone, about the size of a deck of cards, plus lint.
the killer could have been carrying something in his pocket.
a cell phone?
I was isolating the ambient noise on the voice mail, trying to figure out where Hutch was when he placed this call.
it wasn't his S and M room?
it should have been to fit in with the timeline, but, no, it wasn't.
I'm so impressed you were able to pinpoint an exact location from a handful disparate sounds.
uh, actually, I-I couldn't do that.
no need to worry. You are still a valued member of our team.
I'm not finished yet, sweetie.
a twist? Please continue.
so, uh, I realized that I shouldn't have been focusing on the background noise at all, but rather, the message itself.
Hey, Bob, it's Hutch. I'm not feeling too well, so I won't be coming in.
I'll call you later on.
now, listen to this sound file that I pulled off Hutch's show.
Hello, caller. This is Hutch.
what's your question?
same person. That's not a twist.
well, it's not the same person.
that is a twist. - Listen to this.
Hey, caller, let me tell you why the right is dead wrong when it comes to guns.
well, that doesn't sound anything like the victim.
it's the victim's co-host, Alan Spaziano.
now look what happens when I run all three recordings through the voice recognition software.
so, I found clear deviations on the pitch and tone in both of Hutch's voice files.
but the pitch and tone were a perfect match for Alan Spaziano.
Spaziano pretended to be Hutch in order to obfuscate time of death?
and to give himself an airtight alibi.
uh, Bones, come on.
Spaziano's waiting. You ready to go in?
I'm not going in. What do you mean you're not going in?
you're not needed at the lab, okay? You have everything we need to nail him.
I agree. I've gone over all the forensic evidence with Agent Aubrey.
remember it's pronounced "Albi-cans," not "kahn." - What if I just say "thrush"?
no, no. I will not have my science dumbed down just because you don't know Latin, is that clear?
excuse me for one second. I need to talk to you.
what? - You're not a shrink, okay?
just stick to bones and stuff that you know. - I am using what I know, Booth.
as an anthropologist, I understand the danger inherent in making your world too small.
after times of national trauma, many countries become isolationist.
it happened in Japan with the sakoku policy, the United States after World War I.
would you stop? This is not time for a history lesson.
there is someone in there we need to interrogate. Now let's...
this is precisely the time. Those countries needed time to rebuild, but then, eventually, they had to reengage and recognize that they had allies they could trust.
you do, too. You can trust him, Booth.
I know a good man when I see one.
I picked you, didn't I?
I'll meet you at home.
Yup, yup, I know.
back to my desk. - Would you get your ass in here, okay?
what was it, uh, "kahn"? Right? Is that what she said?
no, cans, cans, cans, cans. Cans.
look, we know that the call from Hutch was actually you.
I was just messing with Bob. I mean, that's all.
you can't arrest me because I can do voices.
true. That's why we arrested you for murder.
why would I kill Hutch? Without him, my career is finished.
well, I couldn't agree with you more, right?
which is why you used your cell phone to video Hutch in his S and M gear.
so you could blackmail him, force him to stay on the show.
what you didn't realize was the handcuffs had a safety release.
when Hutch saw you, he freed himself and attacked.
that's when you struck him in the face with your cell phone, causing Hutch to drown in his own blood.
you have no proof of anything you just said.
Oh, no. Actually, we do.
right? I mean, we found bacteria on the victim's tooth that was transferred from your phone.
disgusting fact-- cell phones carry ten times more bacteria than a toilet seat.
your wife is a fountain of information.
Yup. Among the bacteria we found was one called Candida albicans.
it causes blotches on the gums.
look, all we got to do is just swab your gums, match your DNA, and that's all the proof we need.
it was an accident.
I didn't know that he was going to attack me.
I was trying to save my job. I'm not a violent person.
I'm anti-guns. I'm against the death penalty.
this is not who I am. It was an accident!
it was an... it was an accident.
DNA is a match, so conviction is assured.
all right, so, since you weren't in interrogation, you're not gonna get one of these, I don't think, huh?
us sharing a celebratory drink is never contingent on my presence at time of arrest.
besides, I'm not sure you... I want whatever it is you're making.
let me give you a little taste. You're gonna love it.
it's called a B&B. Oh. You named it after us?
beer and bourbon. I'm kidding.
just, go ahead, try it out. You'll love it, all right?
just expand your world.
that's excellent. It's excellent, right?
I-I mean, 'cause it's got a little... It's got some tequila in there.
a little ginger beer, some creme DE cassis. I mean, it's-it's a weird combination, but it works somehow.
like us.
like us. Shake it, baby.
are you expecting someone? - No.
are you? -No.
Aubrey, come on in. - I come bearing gifts.
or gift actually. I wasn't sure if you guys were wine drinkers, but I, uh, just wanted to say thanks to both of you for letting me join the team.
uh, means a lot. Look at that, huh?
wow, a whole $9. 99 worth.
which is a lot given his salary. Very understanding.
come on in, huh? I'll make you a drink. Come on.
I'm good. I'm good.
Yeah, I can be obnoxious when I drink, you know.
don't want to screw up a good thing here, so, just gonna take it slow.
Yeah. See you tomorrow.
Yeah. Tomorrow.
thank you. Good night.
you know what? You were right about him.
he was good.
I mean, he is good. - You know what he told me?
he thinks you're the best agent in the department. And I agreed with him.
Oh, okay, so that's how you want it now.
I get it. You in the lab, me out in the field with him.
was he that good?
Yeah. You know what? He was good.
and of course, I handpicked him.- But we're still partners.
you still need me, right? - Oh, someone sounds a little insecure.
are you teasing me?
no. What? Am I? No.
stop, Booth. Just make me another drink.
another drink?
stop, Booth! Come on.
I thought I'd start my speech with a joke. Right.
erwin Schrodinger gets pulled over by the police for speeding.
the officer says, "What's in the trunk?
Schrodinger says, "A cat." The officer says, "Well, I need to see.
so police officer opens the trunk, he says, "This cat is dead.
Schrodinger says, "Well, it is now.
give me a heads up when the joke's coming. Well, that was a joke, Booth.
it's based on Schrodinger's famous thought experiment...
Ah, you know what, I usually judge a joke by how funny it is.
and there was no yuks on that one.
great, now my speech for the forensic convention has no beginning.
try this for a joke. You hear about the, uh, restaurant on the moon?
great food but no atmosphere. That's not a science joke.
Yes, it is-- it's got the word "moon." It's got the word "atmosphere.
that's very "sciencery." Here.
I- I'm not hungry. Wow, you really are nervous about all this.
it's the National Forensic Sciences Convention.
being chosen as the keynote speaker is a great honor and a terrible responsibility.
no jokes. Jokes-- out the door.
you are the smartest person in that room. They're gonna love you.
eat up. What?
wow, this is amazing.
look at all this stuff. Wow, it's Dr. Brennan.
Ooh, they're here! Dr. Brennan!
Amanda Gurtz. I'd be a very good intern, Dr. Saroyan.
I've worked closely with anomalies in gap junction-competent cells and micronucleus formation...
thank you, I will take a look at it. Okay.
I'm Dr. Howard Fitch. I've developed a combustible gas detector and also...
thank you for your card. Gosh, this is crazy.
it's like walking into a show with my dad. Ms. Montenegro?
you are the most brilliant person at the Jeffersonian.
your steganographic decryption and stochastic deduction...
so sorry, we're actually in a rush, so...
Oh, no, no. Don't be rude.
let her, let her finish, Hodgins.
you were saying? I just think you're amazing.
this is amazing, huh? Awesome.
it's a pleasure to see you again, Dr. Hodgins. I have been following your illustrious career.
I thought the security here was tight. I guess not.
well, we are colleagues now, I thought you'd...
colleagues? Excuse me.
you are an incompetent forensic entomologist and a disgrace to your profession.
I'm Dr. Camille Saroyan. I work with...
Yes, I know who you are. Dr. Leona Saunders. Dr. Hodgins and I...
have nothing more to say to each other. Excuse me.
cam, I think the smart glasses you want to see are over here.
what was that? Nothing, that was ancient history.
these record everything at the crime scene so you can revisit the footage whenever you want.
a useful device for people with no memory or powers of observation.
Hey. You okay?
Yeah. You know what, I got to go deal with something, okay?
I'm gonna catch you later.
excuse me. Yeah.
what, what are you doing here?
have you heard of a Dr. Saunders? Uh, no.
old feud, apparently. Speaking of old feuds, Dr. Brennan.
Tess is a forensic novelist who has no comprehension of forensics.
we know who Tess Brown is, sweetie. What are you doing here?
I'm researching a new book. A novel approach.
you never researched any of your other books.
and I'd like to make amends with you and possibly even become friends.
by all means, do your research.
but I could never be friends with someone who publicly displays such contempt for their readers.
Dr. Brennan. I'm Aldus Carter. It is an honor to meet you.
would you like a sample of my non-stick examination gloves?
thank you. They're very practical at a crime scene.
these are great. Take the whole box of gloves, please.
thank you.
Dr. Brennan, you are looking lovely today. I- I thought so, myself, Dr. Harkness.
is it time? Hello, Edward.
well, I would like to introduce you to the other board members before we get underway if that's okay.
of course. Please.
does everyone in this place hate each other? You and I are fine, aren't we?
sorry. Hey, you've been gone forever.
is everything okay? Yeah, totally.
never better. Hello, everyone!
thank you.
I am Dr. Edward Harkness, director of the National Forensic Sciences Convention.
and it gives me great pleasure to introduce our keynote speaker.
a woman who, like a fine Cabernet that combines phenolic compounds, anthocyanins and colloids to produce perfection... I hate wine geeks.
... which makes her, some say, the greatest forensic anthropologist in the last 50 years.
please give a warm welcome to the incomparable Dr. Temperance Brennan.
thank you, Dr. Harkness. Yeah!
good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I am quite excited to be in a room full of people familiar with the legends of the science world.
people like the great physicist Dr. Erwin Schrodinger.
imagine, if you will, Dr. Schrodinger driving to work...
please, everyone, move, move to the exits.
Oh, my God, the place is on fire!
to the exits, everyone. Thank you.
there's a body in there. And it's burning!
what, do you smell that? Ugh, that is gasoline.
the fire is still localized. This extinguisher should contain it.
this makes no sense. Why isn't it putting out the fire?
okay, this isn't the time for a science lesson, let's just go.
we need to get out of here while we still can.
the evidence is burning. Now, Dr. Brennan!
it seems like they all have equipment they want to sell us.
these remains look as if they've burned for hours. It couldn't have been more than ten minutes.
well, there's no security cameras in here, right? So, perfect place for a bonfire.
can't see anything in here. - You know what, there's surveillance cameras out in the hallway.
why don't you go hook up with hotel security, see if they got something? Thanks.
high intensity L. E.D. lamps!
pure light that won't alter the visual integrity of the evidence.
Dr. Saroyan! I have an arson scene tool kit and some debris sifters that...
stop. Stop, all right, everybody? Just keep it down out here, all right?
I'd like a headlamp. Yeah, me, too.
Yeah, lamps for everyone. Who's got the L. E.D. lamps?
here! I got four.
cool. Thank you. Thank you.
for you. Thank you.
what is this white crust?
Where's my lamp?
fire department used a class "D" extinguisher to put out the fire and left a sodium chloride shell all over the remains.
you don't see that every day. Class "D," that's a metal fire.
that's right, yeah.
most likely alkaline-based like, uh, magnesium or titanium, which burns at even higher temperatures.
well, the extreme heat of the fire explains why her remains fused to the concrete floor, the stairs and part of the railing. You already know it's a "her"?
Hey, everybody. Hey!
Mr. Bray! Whoa, somebody had a bad day.
the small brow ridges and the sharp upper margins of the orbit suggest the victim is a female. Already noted, Mr. Bray.
here, brother. Thanks.
you allowed to be here? He's had no medical cannabis for a month.
the DOJ and the Jeffersonian gave him the all clear.
because I got into the clinical trial Dr. B. recommended.
you're still in remission? Yep.
well, you know, it's good to have you back. It's good to be back.
the symphyseal surface of the pelvis shows a woman about 40 years old.
I've got a badly burned lanyard here. Can't make out an ID.
here, let me see that. That is definitely an ID from this convention.
okay, hand it over to me, all right?
I'll get it to Angela in the, uh, hotel security room.
maybe she can ID it. All right, everybody-- listen up, all right?
I know that you're all forensic super-experts, but today you have to stay on the other side of the yellow tape.
what the hell is she doing? She's the least of my worries.
okay, look, do me a favor. Get this to Angela in security, see if she can ID the victim.
I'll take care of that mess.
all right? All right.
let him out. I'm here researching my new book, Hotter than My Heart.
I was in the back of the ballroom, listening to the wonderful Dr. Brennan when the alarm went off.
it was my quick reaction that saved the corpse from burning to a crisp.
okay, that's it. Break it up. Let's go.
go find a Kardashian. Party's over, all right?
thank you. Bye-bye.
do you have any idea who I am? Yeah, I do.
my car wash sells your books.
but, you know what, you are not gonna use this murder to promote yourself.
am I hurting someone? Yes, you are-- someone with a sense of decency.
now, I have to ask you a few questions. Me?
Yes, you. Now, you were the first to see the body, right?
come on. Come on, let's go.
we have to separate the remains from the floor and the railing so we can bring them back to the lab.
more than half the tissue has been vaporized because of the intense heat of the fire.
running tox screens is gonna be difficult. Here you go.
this should help us scrape her off the floor and the railing.
what is it? Well, it's a concrete and metal saw all in one.
Dr. Fitch out there invented it.
I've got a biodegradable solution that might loosen the tissue fused to the floor!
Might"! It also "might" destroy evidence!
and your saw won't damage tissue and bone?
is that a thermocouple?
I gave it to him! Yeah, uh...
it's a digital wireless thermocouple with downloadable memory.
Wow. Can I see that?
Yeah, sure. - Can I see, too?
Hey, a shoeprint.
it looks like it's burned right into the concrete.
the security cameras outside the plumbing and electrical room were turned off.
so we have no way of knowing who went in and out of that room.
you should get everyone's cell phones, those smart glasses, anything that could be used to take a picture or a video.
already on it. Okay.
here we go. But isn't it still too damaged?
well, for this computer, yeah, but I linked in with my system at the Jeffersonian.
it can take whatever data is still on this stripe and check it against all of the female registrants.
she's free.
I need the remains transferred to the Jeffersonian immediately.
I'm still working, Dr. Brennan.
Yeah, me, too, and with these people at this convention, we have all the tools that we need.
what are you doing? Well, I am making a mold of the shoeprint.
with what? I got this from some guy out there that's experimenting with this inert polymer resin that's totally noninvasive.
Yeah, I'm sorry I asked. Just keep at it.
I really should develop a few of my ideas.
now, that, that is impressive.
the rosy color and creamy, curdled texture of this area of blood suggest the victim died before the fire.
there are injuries to the fourth sternal rib on the left side.
could be a stab wound. Tissue damage to the torso seems to confirm that.
what about time of death? Despite the damage done by the fire, I see no signs of lividity or lactic buildup, so the victim must have died no more than one or two hours before the fire was set.
so there are four female registrants that are unaccounted for.
I can match these pictures with the ones I took of the victim.
Oh, my God. What?
Leona Saunders. Who- who is Leona Saunders?
Hodgins knew her. They- they talked just before she died.
about what? I don't know.
I- I don't know, I wasn't there.
Hodgins? Yeah?
you knew, uh, Leona Saunders?
unfortunately. Why? What is she doing now?
well, she's dead, she's our victim. Are you serious?
Yeah. Oh, my God.
wow, I feel terrible because I don't feel terrible.
well, if you have any information... No, I don't have any information.
we talked-- well, we argued, actually.
argued? That doesn't sound good.
when I was in college, I designed an odor-recognition system for locating buried human remains, right?
it contained a small box with ten sensors to respond to 20 different classes of chemicals that decaying bodies emit.
stop. Just cut to the chase.
she stole my plans. She claimed them as her own.
wound about making about four million bucks off of it.
anyway, she shows up today and she wants to, like, make up like nothing ever happened.
you got to be kidding. You realize that doesn't look good?
all right? You're arguing minutes before our victim was killed?
are you serious, Booth? There's probably a line of people who hated her.
guys, can we just focus on the evidence, because it certainly does not point to me.
I didn't say that it did.
but we have to look at you just like we would any other person of interest. This is unbelievable.
this is the third time I've been a murder suspect.
that makes me want to kill someone so you don't waste your time.
it was a joke. I was joking.
do you want to see the evidence I found or what?
sure do. Yeah, we do.
let's see. All right, okay.
what I got here is,
I found olive oil and canola oil on the shoeprint along with food particulates.
now, that, plus the design of the actual shoe itself, makes me think maybe we're looking for someone that worked in the kitchen.
makes sense. Dr. Brennan said there might have been stab wounds.
okay, this is good. So the kitchen knife is possibly the murder weapon.
let me... Get the mold.
the mold!
no, Aubrey, not the positive, the negative.
okay, great, got it. Listen, Aubrey...
Aubrey, what's taking you so long, all right?
assistant manager just told me that one of the kitchen workers clocked out early.
he's still in the kitchen?
just left. Okay, you're fast.
hold-hold it right there! FBI. Don't move.
I- I didn't do anything. Right, you didn't do anything.
you're just taking off to do a little charity work, huh?
I'm sick; I got a stomach thing.
Yeah, poor baby. Give us your shoe.
what? - Your shoe.
take off your right shoe and throw it over here.
easy.
drop your bag.
perfect match. Oh, perfect match, huh?
looks like we found Cinderella. Okay, turn around.
hands on the head, let's go.
let's see here, Malik Farris.
two years for robbery, three years for assault, four years for arson?
Oh, arson, what a coincidence.
man, you got me down there bad, but I'm not that guy no more.
that why we found the victim's empty wallet in the kitchen trash?
because that would be another coincidence, wouldn't it? Yeah, coincidence.
and you had all of this cash on you. Help me out here, Malik, huh?
a successful forensic entomologist has no money, but a dishwasher fresh out of jail has $560.
what's wrong with this picture? The picture's racist.
that's what's wrong with it. What, a man of color can't have money, huh?
all right, look, I don't know about you, but I'm tired of dancing, all right?
we have your shoeprint at the murder scene, Malik.
okay, sometimes I use that place to herb down a little bit.
you know what I'm saying? But this time there was a dead body, the whole place stunk of gasoline, I thought it was ready to blow, so, you know, I got out of there real fast.
of course you didn't tell anyone about the dead woman or the potential explosion.
come on, man. You seen my rap sheet.
something like this goes down, I'm the first guy to get blamed.
and look at me, here I am.
you're here because you left your shoeprint at the crime scene, and you stole cash off a dead woman.
I mean, you honestly think we won't find your prints on that wallet?
look, if you're innocent, why don't you just tell us what else you saw in there?
or who else?
man, I want a public defender, and a sober one.
I don't want to have to go back to the joint.
there's evidence of striations on the fifth and sixth left ribs, the fifth and seventh right ribs, and here on the left margin of the sternum.
more evidence of knife wounds?
possibly, but I need to clean the bones so Dr. Brennan and I can make a conclusive determination.
not yet, brother. I haven't finished my particulates sweep.
it's taking a long time. Yeah, well, this woman is covered in food refuse.
I think that she was transferred there in a garbage can.
the dishwasher has access to the garbage cans. People see him wheeling them around every day.
no one would suspect a thing.
you know, if you gave me a hand, I could finish my job a lot faster.
if it gets me cleaning the bones sooner, I'm all yours.
all right, then, walk this way, Mr. Bray, into the wonderful world of forceps and swabbing.
looks like the organ gods are smiling down on us.
I've got a stomach. Think you can recover anything from it?
let's hope so.
Oh, look at you, huh? This is a treat.
I thought you would be stuck in the lab. I can't do anything until the bones are clean.
right. They're so covered in particulates,
I don't know when that'll be. How did you get away?
uh, suspect washed out.
the dishwasher? Yeah.
you know, the surveillance camera caught him in the dining room. The timestamp was 11: 58 a. m.
so there's no way he could get from the dining room to the plumbing and electric room in time to set the victim on fire.
Nah. Ah, look at that, huh?
Hey, thank you.
thank you. Wait a second.
did you order this for me?
you are so sweet. Thank you.
I'm no closer to finding the killer than I was when the remains were smoldering.
Oh," what? You think you'll look bad in front of all these forensic geeks if it takes you too long to solve this one.
if I solve this one. All right, look.
I'll bet you 100 bucks that they'll be even more jealous when it's done.
booth, you're in Gamblers Anonymous. You shouldn't be betting.
right, and you're a genius, all right?
so don't say stupid things. Have some pie.
well, maybe a bite. Come on, have some pie, all right?
here, have a piece of the pie. Hello, synthetic rubber.
all right, well, this is some kind of copolymer. So, so far we have got coffee grounds, melted aluminum foil, two kinds of plastic, polyester, Styrofoam, gum and rubber.
and two trays of stuff yet to be identified.
particulates. Don't say "stuff.
it's sacrilege.
you really doing good? Yeah.
Yeah, I'm back at the gym. I can even have a beer.
I'm a big fan of remission. We all are.
and the trial is having great success. There are 12 of us in the group, and everyone's doing well.
three cheers for modern science, huh? Yeah.
Oh, I got something weird here. Looks like tissue.
do you mind if I do the honors? You are in remission.
you can do whatever you want.
not tissue, it's gummy.
can you put it up on the monitor? Yeah.
a piece of a Band-Aid? Yeah.
if it was worn, maybe Cam can pull some DNA off of it?
no, it's been in a fire. Cam wouldn't have a chance.
wouldn't have a chance of what? Uh, of getting some DNA off this Band-Aid we found.
Oh, Dr. Hodgins is right.
odds are against it, but it's worth a shot.
and I have a gift for you in return.
the victim's last meal. Ah.
based on digestion, ingested around 3: 00 a. m.
I need it analyzed and ID'd.
might be able to tell us where the victim was or who she was with before she died.
you got it.
there's no obvious defensive injuries, so the victim might have known the killer.
or was just unafraid of the killer.
enlarge the sternum? Okay.
the sternum. An oldie but a goodie, huh?
there is a spiderweb fracture on the sternum.
the victim was struck and winded, giving the assailant time to stab.
so someone who knew what they were doing.
I've got the DNA results from the Band-Aid found on the remains.
And?
I'm sure it's easily explained.
what? What is it?
the DNA's a match for Dr. Hodgins.
