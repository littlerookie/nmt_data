miss su glanced at him; then lowering her head she said, "sometimes I really shouldn't be so kind to you."
miss su had always scorned the poor, simple-minded mrs. sun and detested children, but when she heard all that, she was quite pleased. Smiling pleasantly, she said, "let him come. I love kids."
miss su had always scorned the poor, simple-minded mrssun and detested children, but when she heared all that, she was quite pleased. Smiling pleasantly, she said, "let him come. I love kids."
miss su picked out the tiger balm, dabbed a little on her finger and applied it to hung-chien's temples.
miss su said with a smile, "you'd better hurry. Aren't you afraid someone will get impatient?"
miss su said, "I don't remember this poem ever being discussed in the history of european literature class."
miss su said, "excuse me, all of you wait here a minute. I will show you something."
miss su said, "hung-chien, I think you've had too much to drink. Your eyes are all red."
miss su said, "if it is something good, you don't have to remember it. It'll leave a deep impression by itself."
miss su said, "stay a while. Wait until your headache stops before you go."
miss su said, "you can introduce mr. fang to mr. li."
miss su then said, "hung-chien, if there's a joke let us hear it."
miss su was so furious that chills ran through her body. Those two have no sense o f shame whatsoever, she thought. Right in full view of everyone using cigarettes to kiss.
miss su's attitude toward him visibly cooled, so he asked miss pao in private why miss su had been snubbing him lately.
miss su's chauffeur tipped his cap to him, saying, "you've come at just the right time. Young lady arrived not more than a few moments ago."
miss su's eyes followed him out, while she remained seated in the pavilion.
miss su's parting manner dampened fang hung-chien's high spirits.
miss su's relatives, who worked at the local chinese consulate, sent a car to the wharf to pick her up for dinner, and so, with everyone watching enviously, she was the first one to get off the ship. The remaining students decided to eat at a chinese restaurant.
miss su, I'll tell you something funny. You and mr. fang were classmates in china. Does he always say whatever he pleases?

miss sun agreed immediately. "I'll go right now."
miss sun came closer to look and said uncertainly, "it looks like western medicine."
miss sun had something of a seat on the long wooden bench, but it too was rather uncomfortable. The two men on either side had both shifted their thighs to make a space just big enough to fill in the small section of a monkey's tail before the monkey had evolved into man.
miss sun is a very nice person, but she's so messy. She has her things all over the room.
miss sun is coming tonight.
miss sun is cute in her own way, but her charm is unnatural and contrived and she is n't a true beauty.
miss sun knew this to be true, while to the others it just sounded as though he was being polite.
miss sun not only sought his advice, but was ready to follow his every word as well. This pleased him so much; it left no room in his mind for suspicion.
miss sun replied, "you've already looked after me all the way-"
miss sun said gently but firmly, "I'll go with mr. chao too. My baggage has also arrived."
miss sun said she would be sure to write to miss fan.
miss sun said, "mr. li was blowing hot air, while you were snorting cold air."
miss sun said, "that coffee candy has no milk in it. How could it be called milk coffee? Milk powder must have been added to it."
miss sun said, "you said the voice you heard was like a child's, and the hands in my dream were like a child's, too. It's just too strange."
miss sun was also getting tired of being jostled and tossed about while standing, and so, with a word of apology to the greasy-faced fellow, she prepared to sit down.
miss sun would n't sit at first, but unable to take the jolting of the bus and at the insistence of her companions, she sat down.
miss sun's correspondence with lu tzu-hsiao weighed on hung-chien's mind like a rat gnawing on something in the walls. He was disturbed by it all evening and couldn't stop thinking about it.
miss sun, who had apparently caught on to his intention, just smiled and said nothing.

hoover's attitudes on race reflected those in the old washington, where he grew up, a largely segregated southern city.
hoover's book, according to the publisher's note that serves as a preface, was published posthumously.
hoover's conservative economics were inappropriate for dealing with the crisis.
hoover's father's family had roots in virginia and mississippi in the antebellum south, where interracial liaisons were not uncommon.
Hoover, at his death, left tolson most of his estate.
Hoover, by most signs, would have preferred to join his contemporaries going "over there" to fight the germans.
