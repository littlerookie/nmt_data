my eyes are very sharp.
the way a cat keeps a watch over a mouse.
l am keeping a watch over you.
remember, brother. Mouse is also a very dangerous animal.
lt bites the roots of the tree and makes it weak.
and what happens when the tree falls on the mouse?
the mouse is squashed.
lf you stayed within your limits, you will benefit.
brother, you don't know Jimmy.
l am also very smart.
and l don't spare anybody.

this is what l want. Keep me forever in your arms.
l am telling the truth. Your figure has made me crazy.

but don't remove me from your heart, darling.
l said shut up!
brother. ma'am is calling you.
Jimmy! - Yes, ma'am?

he is downstairs, ma'am.
Johnny! Remove this uniform!
ln front of you?

there is no need for an insolent man like you in this hotel.
brother, now what insolence did you do that ma'am is so infuriated?
ma'am, l am telling the truth. l didn't do anything!
don't lie!
didn't you talk nonsense with Pooja on the phone yesterday?
you even called me a bomb. - Bomb?
Oh no, brother!
l never thought you could be so shameless!
ma'am, you should sack such a man immediately!
you have been mistaken!
mistaken? Can't l recognize your voice?
and on the phone you even told your name.
Yes. That is right.
tell me. At what time did l call you?
around 7 o'clock in the evening.
7 o'clock in the evening.
my nephew!
my father died!
don't cry, dear! - My father died!
fool! Your father's 4th day death ceremony is over.
lf you didn't stop crying, l will not spare you too.
understood!
ma'am. He is the evidence of my innocence.
l went to Nasik with my orphan child and widow sister.
to immerse my brother-in-law's ashes.
ma'am. As it is such a grave burden has befallen on my family.
and today you too!
my father died! My father died!
Johnny. l am really sorry.
ma'am. Because of my orphan and widow sister.
l had to become a waiter.
otherwise even l am an educated man.
the hands that should be holding pen.
those hands are carrying tray of snacks and sandwich.
no, ma'am. l can endure everything.
but not my humiliation. l will leave the hotel today itself.
Yes! Yes! You are right!
a self-made man like you shouldn't wait here even for a second.
come! l will escort you to the bus stop.
hang on. She wants to say something.
no, Johnny! - Come on!
you will not go anywhere. - Really?
l understood! Somebody has tried to frame you.
lf l found that man, l will not spare him.
l will also not spare him.
brother, you had taken the oath that you will not leave me.
Oh God!
don't leave me! Hold on! - What?
the sheet, brother!
you like to imitate, don't you? Now imitate!
brother! You have hung me at such a place.
you have brought me to such a great height that even my voice is cracking.
you will completely lose your voice.
fool! You wanted to put me into trouble! - No!
l was lucky that l heard you and l thought of that baldy's idea.
otherwise you would have made me bald! Understood!
No! l am very, very sorry, brother! Forgive me!
l will never do it again.
fine, l forgive you.
do you see this door?
lt will take the decision of your life and death.
till the time the door is locked, you will live.
when this door will open.
no, brother!
brother! Brother! - Yes!
please open the door, brother! l am sorry!
l am here!
what are you doing sitting here?
l was flying very high!
so l am sitting outside and having fresh air!
how cool!
the hero of my novel also likes excitement and adventure.
and you are my real life hero.
you are just like my novel hero.
Jimmy, l am so happy to have you.
after some time, you will be sad not to have me.
Jimmy, you don't worry. l am there.
what l will do is l will open the door and open the sheet.
No! Don't open the door!
l will spend my whole life here. But don't open the door.
1 . 2. - Where have you reached?
no, no! Start again!
okay. 1 . 2. 3! Caught you!
Yes! Yes!
Jimmy, you are great!
l am not great! God is great! He saved me!
but Jimmy, right now we are neither on earth nor in the sky.
we are dangling somewhere in the middle.
Yes, Kim. l think no boy has ever proposed to a girl at such a location.
but l will do it today. l love you, Kim.
and maybe no girl has accepted the proposal in this position.
but l will do it. l love you too, Jim.
your youth has cast a spell on my heart.
your youth has cast a spell on my heart.
after locking eyes with you, your love has made me lose control.

he is not crazy who got scared of craziness.
your youth has cast a spell on my heart.
after locking eyes with you, your love has made me lose control.
crazy.

he is not crazy who got scared of craziness.
your love has started harassing me so much.
your love has started harassing me so much.
lt has started striking lighting on my heart.
this intoxicating atmosphere spreads fragrance.
you touched me and l went crazy.
love.

love. Love.
this love of the heart has made me mad.
your youth has cast a spell on my heart.
your love has cast a spell on my heart.
l am crazy for you.
why shouldn't l say it to everybody?
l am crazy for you.
why shouldn't l say it to everybody?
my desire is to dwell in your heart.
love has affected both of us.
you too started swaying.
and l lost my heart too.
tell me.
tell me.
tell me. Tell me.
lt's difficult to tell.
what your love has done!
your youth has cast a spell on my heart.
after locking eyes with you, your love has made me lose control.
crazy.

he is not crazy who got scared of craziness.
junior. The game that you played to put me into trouble.
now just wait and watch.
how l entice Pooja using the same game.
juice for you.
but l didn't order for any juice.
l mean to say that you exercise so much.
so juice will be good for your health. Please drink it.
thank you. - Thank you.
on the first day your impression was very bad.
l am happy that my impression has improved from bad to good.
by the way, ma'am. That day what did l say to you?
what!
l mean the person who imitated my voice.
what did he say?
let it be.
l mean l should know.
he was saying that my figure is very nice.
your figure is nice?
Why? My figure is not good?
no, this is not so, ma'am. Your figure is very nice.
lf you participated in Ms. World.
you will surely win the 1 st, 2nd and 3rd title.
what else did he say?
he was saying that l am beautiful.
lie! Lie!
lie? l am not beautiful?
no, you are very beautiful.
you are so beautiful that l remembered a verse.
when God glances on the earth from the sky.
he must be wondering who created my madam.
you are reciting the wrong verse.
he must be wondering who created my beloved.
beloved? How can l say beloved?
you are my madam.
and yes. He also said that l look good in western clothes.
ln western clothes you look very nice.
but if you wore lndian clothes.
it will create a commotion in lndia.
will you have one more? - What?
juice! - No, thank you.
Johnny! Where were you?
since when l was searching for you.
now what mistake have l committed, ma'am?
no, you said to wear lndian dress.
so tell me. How do l look?
ma'am. To tell you the truth l don't have words to express your beauty.
but whoever sees you, he will say.
east or West, lndia is the best.
what's the matter, Pooja? You look very worried.
did anything materialize, uncle?
what to tell you? We are not receiving any offer from the party.
you are taking this matter very lightly, uncle.
what are you saying, Pooja?
maybe you don't know how worried l am.
uncle, you don't understand.
lf we don't deliver them 30 crores.
then they will take legal action against Pooja.
l will do one thing.
l will publish another ad in the paper.
lt's futile to waste time.
l think l myself should go to Goa.
what!
how can you do all this alone in Goa?
l will go to Goa.
no, uncle. As it is you are loaded with work.
and we are as it is free.
so we both will go there and make a deal with the people.
you just book the ticket for tomorrow.
l will have to do something about you.
ma'am, l have seen such situations in movies.
the heroine runs ahead and the goons follow her.
the heroine dashes with the hero.
then what happens is the hero removes the goggles.
he bashes the goons.
the heroine falls in love with the hero.
l will do the hero's work. You don't do the heroine's work.
Johnny, you.
no, ma'am. Now you will ask me if l am hurt.
the fight has just started. They are going to be injured.
Johnny! - No! Don't thank me.
otherwise l will have to say that this was my duty.
let's go, Johnny.
where? The sequence has not ended.
don't you see in movies that after the fight.
either the police or the heroine's family arrives.
and they ask dear, are you fine?
dear, are you fine?
l am fine, uncle. But what enmity could they have with me?
dear, this business is very bad.
lt creates secret enemies.
but now l won't take any chance.
God forbid if anything had happened to you.
then how could l have lived?
do one thing. Leave Goa. And leave for Mauritius.
you don't worry about this place.
l will sell everything and bring the money to Mauritius.
and then l am more worried about you than money, dear.
Wow! Wow, sir! You are right!
good morning, ma'am.
where is Johnny sir?
l know Johnny. But who is this sir?
some new guest has arrived?
fine, fine. Remove the packet from inside.
what does it have?
ls it necessary to tell you? - No.
quietly pick up the package and follow me.
follow you!
Yes, ma'am.
from today you won't do this work. - Why?
because l am sacking you from the job.
what mistake did l commit?
you don't deserve this job.
God delays but does not deny.
l am fortunate, dear.
Johnny, this waiter's uniform doesn't suit your personality.
only the prisoner's uniform suits your personality.
from today you will work as a lobby manager, not a waiter.
why did you let go of this? Pick it up.
that's why l have got a gift for you.
ma'am, what was the need for this?
there was a need. That's why l have got it.
all the best. Thank you so much. Bye.
thank you, ma'am.
send this gift to my room.
and thug, listen. Nothing should go missing from this.
understood!
Hey, who are you to order me?
l am the lobby manager. And you are the waiter. Okay.
lf you don't respect me, l will make you the gatekeeper.
you know that Bahadur. Salute me! Salute me!
Yes! Whenever you see me, always be in this position. Okay.
a bit high correct. Okay!
brother is too good!
from 30 crores, he is going for 330 crores.
brother! l will not spare you!
l will follow you like a shadow. You will slip someday.
because a thief might give up robbery but not his habit of stealing.
this girl has put me into trouble by making me the lobby manager.
when l was a waiter, l got tip.
now l don't even get a tip! l have become a pauper!
a pauper!
Oh God!
l will see you.
that conference is on Sunday. - Sunday.
that London deal.
okay, sir!
lf there is not enough space, then use the main hall.
the small one?
not the small one, the big one.
my phone.
my mobile phone! l had kept it here!
where did my phone go?
what happened, sir? Your mobile is stolen?
l had kept it here only.
hang on! Hang on!
nobody will go anywhere!
everybody come here!
what happened, sir?
what happened? - My phone.
sir's mobile is stolen. - What! Sir's mobile.
today mobile is stolen. Tomorrow his pants could be stolen.
l mean to say guests' things could be stolen.
sir, l will check.
no need for this!
we will find out who is the thief.
give me the phone.
l had important numbers in it! Ruchi's number was also there.
sir, what's your mobile number?
21 1 . 37. - Yes.
000. - We will find out who is the thief.
sir, its ringing! lt's ringing!
the thief is caught! The thief is caught!
sir, l think its ringing from here.
your pocket?
how did this come in my pocket?
sir, l swear on God. He has done it.
hello. - Hello.
hello. - Hello.
hello. - Hello.
Yes, sir. - Tell me!
sir, did you have lunch? - Yes.
what did you have?
eggplant and vegetable.
you eat such rubbish things, sir.
try out Narayandas, the cook's butter chicken, sir.
sir, he had the mobile.
sir, don't listen to him. - Shut up!
you steal and play a drama.
so that a decent man is doubted.
decent?
throw him out of the hotel.
lt's my job. l will do it. Give me a minute.
this is a very respectable hotel.
and we don't need thieves here. Okay.
you look like a good boy.
l don't know what has happened to you.
please come with me.
why are you laughing?
l think God wants us to meet in unique ways.
whenever we meet, we dash with each other.
Yes.
but today we have dashed for the last time.
henceforth we will neither meet nor dash with each other.
Why?
because l am resigning from my job.
what! You are leaving the job and going? But why?
because here the low-grade people don't understand our great love, Kim.
what do you mean?
l mean to say from the accounts department to the kitchen.
from the lobby to the beauty parlour.
every man taunts me about the same thing.
what?
that you should have seen your status.
before loving Kim ma'am, you waiter!
you are a waiter and you weave the dream of marrying a rich girl.
look, Kim. l can endure my humiliation.
but l can't endure anybody tarnishing my love.
so. l have hardened myself and taken a decision.
what decision?
that. When l will become rich like you.
when l will become the owner of such a 5 star hotel.
then l will come to you to ask for your hand.
l am so happy that you are a self-made man.
and you want to do something on your own merit.
but l am going to Mauritius after 2 days.
please wait till then.
Kim. l can't stay here. Try to understand my helplessness.
what helplessness?
just now l have left my job.
lf l went to ask for it back for 2 days. then l will be kicked.
but you can stay here as my guest.
ma'am, if we both stayed in one room.
then those who tarnish our love.
they will slander my image.
nothing! You stay in the room besides mine.
l will arrange for the keys. Okay.
this is not the room keys.
lt is the key to the lock of my fate. Brother! l am back!
brother! lt's futile to search there. We have searched there.
come here. We will search together.
you are such a shameless fellow!
yesterday l kicked you out of the hotel.
again you have come back!
this is a hotel. And now l am the guest.
not an ordinary waiter!
so listen. lf you didn't get 30 crores by tonight.
then bring bed tea to my room by 8: 00 tomorrow morning.
Yes! Wake me up at 7: 00!
and yes! What is 7: 00! l will knock you out right now!
Why? ln just one kick, you started whistling? Shut up!
brother, l am not whistling. lt's coming from behind. Look!
that's why l say no violence! - Run!
hello.
sir, l think somebody has barged into the accounts department.
the alarm rang and we came to check.
but nobody is seen.
lf you say, shall l call the police?
no, don't call the police. Do one thing.
wait there and keep a watch. l am coming.
okay, sir.
you guys go out. l will check.
hello.
Hello, Balram. Where are you? l just called your home.
l am at the office.
office? What are you doing there so late in the night?
l think something is fishy.
what?
something is fishy in Gupta's cabin.
last time l came here, l was kicked.
and now this alarm.
you too! What is there to worry?
had you kept a treasure in that office that somebody will steal it.
l have my doubts.
we had conned that 30 crores.
what if Gupta told somebody before dying?
not somebody, just me.
brother, not just you. He told both of us.
you both and here?
we both came here for that 30 crores.
and Gupta was not my relative.
and my voice is more famous than Amitabh Bachchan.
what do you both want?
100 crores.
100 crores!
ask what you can give!
30 crores. 15 yours, 15 mine.
brother! - No, no! Okay!
look, l don't have so much money.
do one thing. Come tomorrow.
what time?
12 o'clock. But call before you come.
brother, how will we know its 12 o'clock?
take this watch.
he is our man. He is our man.
he has said to call.
take this mobile! He is our man.
but we will go like a billionaire. And we will go in the auto?
look, he has given mobile, watch.
he will give his car too.
he is our man.
take this.
you wear goggles at night?
take it. l am your man.
shall l do something? - Yes.
l will remove my pants too. l am your man only.
the pant is good. What's the size?
get lost!
Cheers!
sorry, brother. Sorry.
look. l can't tolerate if anything falls on my clothes.
remember this.
sorry, brother.
you see. l am very anxious thinking about 10 crores.
l am very excited.
even l am excited. But l am controlling it.
l am thinking. When we will get the money.
then that hotel item girl. Beloved, beloved.
l will marry her.
Wow! - But.
but you can't tolerate if anything falls on your clothes.
l know it, brother. l understand.
but listen to me too.
you are having an affair. Similarly l am also having one.
ln Mauritius.
as soon as l get 10 crores, l will take the flight.
don't weave so many dreams.
because dreams never come true.
look at this! Beggars have arrived before we got the money.
Why? Why will it not come true?
for that it's important for you to survive.
and you are not going to survive.
Yes, if you have some pennies with you.
then buy a shroud.
shroud thug! Who are you?
death for both of you!
our death? So ugly!
no, brother. You can't tolerate if anything falls on your clothes.
l will tear his. - What?
clothes, brother! Clothes!
Cheers!
Oh God!
brother.
l thought its only one man. But 4 men have come.
you are enough for 4 people. What muscles you have!
go! Go!
for 4! - Go!
that is true!
want to fight one by one or all 4 will fight together?
come on!
brother. l think its time for you to get up.
as it is we are partners in crime.
lt's too much!
l trust you completely.
you will bash them black and blue! Go!
l have heard this line somewhere. ls this yours?
lt's from 'Sholay'. Go!
brother, is this your planning? To seize the entire 30 crores?
brother! - Yes!
there are 4 others too!
who slipped the drink? - He.
l bashed him. What have they done?
there!
Cheers!
how did you both come in?
we don't need any door to come in.
we just need a door to go to the prison.
do you think we both are Gupta?
that you send the goons to bash us.
take both of our reports from any police station.
understood? - Brother, what is the need to beat him?
we will go directly to the press.
he will be in the lockup.
or we will go to Pooja ma'am.
he will be in the lockup.
or else we will go to the police.
he will be in the lockup. - Fine, fine, fine.
a person doesn't keep the money at the place where he cons.
l have not kept the money here.
then where is it?
ln Mauritius. - ln Mauritius.
you both come there. You both will get the money.
for money we both can even go to hell.
but to go to Mauritius, we both will need first class ticket.
and first class car. And accommodation.
fine, fine. Come there. You will get everything.
youngsters don't smoke in front of elders.
now we both are not any ordinary thieves.
we both each own 10 crores.
you both.
you all three brothers are useless!
you all drink liquor during daytime.
and don't do any work.
l had raised all three of you because you guys had power and l had intellect.
where is your power?
l had sent you guys to kill Pooja.
and your men were bashed badly.
l had sent you both to beat them.
and he too was thrashed!
Balram, this time l myself will go.
and l will kill both of them.
when brother says dead, then it's dead.
shut up! Dead means dead!
don't kill both of them here. They both.
not here, not there, then where?
ln Mauritius.
l have called both of them to Mauritius.
kill both of them in Mauritius.
and this time the work should be done.
come on!
brother, don't you think he has said too much.
he threatened us as if he is the boss.
and we are his cronies.
we are his cronies! We are his cronies!
what happened, brother?
l am thinking that we have conned 30 crores.
first Gupta came to know and then those two guys.
lf Pooja came to know then Balram along with himself will ruin us too.
and we will lose the entire money.
now, brother?
l am thinking. Why don't we kill Balram?
Yes! - Brother, money! Money!
l know where the money is.
brother, what are you thinking?
look! He has called us to Mauritius to kill them.
but there we will kill Balram, not them.
brother, l understood. Foul play.
and who will get trapped? Those guys!
l am proud of you, brother! What a plan!
Jazzy! - Yes.
make arrangement to go abroad. - Okay.
Balu, pick up!
lt's ringing! Are you dead?
Hello, Balu. This is Hansa speaking.
as soon as you receive our message, call us.
hello.
these all fire when you want them to fire.
I have brought this gift for my two courageous brothers.
thank you sir.
hey Lucky, where the hell do you think you are going, son?
I'm going with my friends for some drinks, dad!
there's a party on tonight.
I hate your parties, dad. Just cut it!
sorry folks. You know, he is half mad. Yes.
not half. He's fully mad!
send someone after him. Ok sir.
you! Go after Lucky! Ok boss.
at last your sister's marriage has been fixed.
Yes, sir. - Your tension is over now.
that means, even my tension is over.
there'll be terrific singing and dancing in tonight's party.
but we have not made arrangements for that.
not to worry, Uday. I am still alive.
guys and gals! It's time to rock!
may the gods, bless these lovers.
and may their alliance last for a lifetime.
come on everybody! Go! Go! Go!
God willing!
God willing!
God willing!
God willing!
praise the lord.
God willing!
in body and soul.
in my heart.
I welcome you.
please come.
o my darling.
o my darling.
we may never separate.
let's pray for that.
let's promise each other.
may we never break the promise of love.
now we are bonded.
may this bond of love never break.
God willing!
God willing!
I am so close to you.
I am not lonely anymore.
I have taken over your thoughts.
like an obsession.
with you my wishes will be fulfilled.
you are the destination of my desires.
may we never stop loving each other.
God willing!
God willing!
our love for each other.
will keep our hearts together.
to you I present.
my utmost faithfulness.
adoration is because of you.
love is because of you.
may our world of love never get destroyed.
God willing!
God willing!
let's promise each other.
may we never break the promise of love.
God willing!
God willing!
God willing!
God willing!
God willing!
God willing!
stop!
I had got the right information! I am ruined! I am doomed!
I am devastated!
God, be kind to her!
I say, what wrong did I do to you that you deceived me?
why did you deceive me?
sister, I am feeling very itchy.
my god, he calls me sister! Sinner, I am not your sister but your wife!
I don't even know you! When did we get married?
and did my uncle allow us to get married?
wait up! Uncle, what did you promise before the villagers?
that you will come to take me when I become an adult!
I have grown so much waiting for you.
how much more do I have to wait?
good.
is this girl saying the truth?
what can this liar say?
I have brought the proof with me.
look at this!
this is l. This is my husband. And that's his uncle.
look, I am not at fault. My sister had got them married.
I didn't know she would come here after so many years.
I think this is god's wish.
did god come down or did he call you up?
Mr. Ghungroo, everything happens as we wish and decide over here.
get out!
let me go! Let me go!
only he can get you justice here. He is above everyone over here.
Control，Uday.
I must have been blind!
why didn't I see the emperor sitting over here?
your majesty, have mercy on me! Have mercy on me!
what does she mean?
what is the meaning of that word?
your majesty, I beg of you to give me back my husband.
and if you can't do it then I have no other option but to kill myself.
stop!
justice will be done!
I will do you justice.
I am still alive!
on one hand are your sister and her happiness.
and on the other are this girl's tears.
on one side is your sister's engagement.
and on the other is this girl's husband.
as I see it, this girl's position is stronger in the eyes of justice.
this engagement cannot take place.
brother Uday, why are you tormenting this poor guy?
I feel like emptying all bullets into RDX's head!
but what is the use doing so?
he survives after being shot six times, thrice.
and after getting up he says, he is still alive.
No!
that girl called him your majesty and he thinks he is the emperor!
and left our sister to suffer!
Majnu, my father used to hold my hand and take me to the temple.
there was something written on the wall of the temple.
humans have to face the punishments for their sins in this live itself.
all my childhood memories have washed away,but I still remember that writing on the wall.
I feel my sins are stopping my sister to attain happiness.
Ishita, you're not only his sister-in-law,but also Rajiv's good friend.
what have you done?
sister, I was told that this alliance is being forced upon you.
brother-in-law lied to me.
wow uncle! You're so cool!
you have deceived me love.
if you were not happy with this alliance,you should have flatly refused.
why create such a huge drama?
this is not my stubbornness but my compulsion.
I had promised your mother that.
you had promised?
my sister had made only one mistake.
she had married into a criminal family.
and for that crime she had to suffer all her life.
death was so painful that she died is sorrow.
she handed you over to me and had said that his son should be brought up away from crime.
I don't have any objection to this alliance.
but I have my reservations about the relatives.
so you're not opposed to the alliance but the relatives.
what if Sanjana's brother gave up crime and became a decent person?
yes uncle, Uday Shetty!
if that were to happen I would happily get you married to Sanjana.
I will dance in your wedding. Really.
but what if you could not reform him?
then I'll myself get Rajiv married to the girl whom you choose.
and I will also dance on his wedding.
are you crazy? I'm not going to be a film director!
I have small kids. Do you want to make my wife a widow?
explain to him.
what should I explain to him? I am myself not going to be the producer!
underworld don, Uday Shetty is the hero? And a fake film shooting!
if he finds out he'll shoot us with real bullets!
I will try that he doesn't kill you.
you'll try? - You'll try?
she'll not just try but she gives her guarantee.
she means she guarantees!
sir, all the arrangements have been made.
Mr. Suniel Shetty has also agreed.
Suniel Shetty? - Yes.
he is in the same hotel. - Really?
when we told him our love story, he said it's all right.
he is Suniel Shetty, she is Sanjana Shetty .
also Uday Shetty and he said he was ready.
all that is fine.
but, for Uday Shetty you are married. What will you do about that?
I will explain to my brother that it was his uncle's trick.
that's it.
Hey, you've come? - Welcome.
Suniel Shetty is also here? - Yes, he is the hero.
Rajiv, why don't you tell the producer to introduce my brother to Suniel Shetty.
that's not such a big thing! - Look here.
I had told you earlier that I'd not do this film without a bound script.
the script is ready. - Where is it then?
in here. - All right!
Mr. Suniel Shetty, this is Uday Shetty. Shetty and Shetty!
Hello! - Hi! How are you?
I am Uday Shetty.
Oh, I see.
what are you trying to say?
are you saying you have doubts on my ability?
no sir, you are a great director! You are a genius!
but script. - No buts and no ifs!
you're shooting with me from tomorrow or else you are out of the film.
that's it!
yes sir. As you wish.
I am leaving.
what do you think? If you don't work with me would I get bankrupt?
sir! - Get lost!
go away! I will make this film without you!
what have you done?
if there is no star then how can we make the film?
from where will we get a hero?
I will pick someone from the streets and make him a star!
greetings.
hey you, come here!
Hey, you.
look over there! Over there!
he'll look good with goggles.
now you are my hero!
what? - I have got him!
what? - A star!
what are you doing? He can't do it. - Why? Why not?
he doesn't know acting, he can just.
my eyes are like a camera!
and this camera has recognized the actor within you.
am I wrong?
actually I am.
tell him.
actually, brother wanted to work in films since childhood. - I knew it!
brother, come aside for a moment. Excuse me!
brother, you can't tolerate this man! - Why?
but he won't with me. I can tolerate him.
no problem. - Do you have the time to do this?
I have all the time for this kind of work.
everyone go there. - Okay, sir.
who is it?
Hey, hurry up. Take this luggage inside. - Okay, sir.
who is Mr. Uday amongst you?
he is Uday Shetty.
hello Mr. Uday. I'm Purushottam, a. k.a Pappu.
I am the new municipal officer of this area.
I hope you know that this house is illegal.
do you know whom it belongs to? - To RDX.
and I also know who he is.
this country does have a legal system.
don't be afraid. I just look dangerous. But I am good at heart.
I work within the limits of the law.
if you have any valuable belongings then take them out.
I am going to demolish this house.
friends, go help him demolish it.
okay, boss.
come on guys! - Come on, I will help you.
sure, why not? Come on.
brother, what are you up to?
is the film's hero giving you a complex?
Ballu, tell him.
I have an artificial limb. I used to be a. - Not that.
tell him what happened at the film's inauguration.
inauguration? Something unbelievable happened!
the director removed Suniel Shetty and took boss as the hero.
he said he can pick anyone from the streets.
no, no! He said he is not picking anybody from the streets.
brother Majnu, boss' photograph has also appeared in the papers!
give it to me! Look at this.
but what's this other thing printed over here.
what's burning?
what? What is burning? Is something burning? - No!
I can smell something.
Majnu, get up! Turn around.
look, there's smoke coming out from behind.
how dare you mess up with brother Uday!
I had told you this house is illegal, not me.
why did you break my bones?
come on, pick me up.
buy some potatoes!
buy some onions!
buy some potatoes! - Cut it!
wonderful! What wonderful acting? Wow!
note down what I say. I am presenting this world with a great actor.
keep it up! Well done!
haider, send the crew forward. I will study the surroundings.
OK fine.
Wow! Brother, you were great!
you are so talented. Amazing.
Sanjana, won't you say anything?
brother, I had thought you wouldn't be able to do it but you've done it so easily!
look here. - What?
what a terrific dialogue!
I have neither sold a potato since morning nor half an onion.
brother, what profession have you taken up?
film acting!
no, I was talking about the other profession.
you were created only to act.
I have neither sold a potato since morning nor an onion.
half! - Yes, half an onion!
excuse me, sir. Your shot. - He is calling you.
sir, madam wants to meet you. - Which madam?
the heroine of your film.
come on, sir. She is Miss lsha.
hello. - Superb.
mind blowing! Fantastic!
nobody would believe this is your first film and first day of shooting.
I am glad to meet you, Uday. - Same here.
I hope you don't mind me calling you Uday. - No! Not at all!
madam, your shot is ready. - She is coming. She's coming.
look Uday, don't feel bad. - No.
but I was going to leave this film. - Why.
because when I found out the director had removed the hero, I wasn't very comfortable.
but when I saw you act! Oh my god!
the way you said that dialogue, buy some potatoes, buy some onions.
I've become a fan of yours.
I just study the actors and try to act.
I want your autograph.
Oh yes!
Thanks! - Welcome!
it would be fun to work with you. - Real fun!
Bye. - Bye.
boss, looks like this heroine has fallen in love with you. - Shut up!
the salt of love is on my tongue.
boss! Take care!
sir, I am in love with your daughter.
nobody in the world can stop me.
brother, you look great!
don't I look wonderful? - Of course!
what are you doing at my shooting?
brother Uday, I have fixed a meeting with D'Silva today.
I have also called Simon from Singapore.
it is important that you attend the meeting.
all right, we'll pack up after the next shot.
we'll go and meet him. If he agrees then fine or else we'll waste him.
Rajiv, looks like we won't be able to reform him.
after he gives the shot, he will go and do his other job.
Sanjana, once you had told me your brother is afraid of horses, right?
Yes. Why?
why so many horses are being brought here?
the director has changed the shot.
previously, you were supposed to come on foot to ask for the girl's hand.
but now you will come on horseback with 25 of your men.
but how can he do that? He can't ride a horse!
I can handle a gun but it's difficult to handle a horse.
it's not difficult, brother.
mount the horse and it will take care of the rest.
the old shot was better where I come on foot.
why don't you explain to him?
brother, you know if I try to explain to the director and being a crack-pot, he may stop the film.
do you want the film to be stopped?
No! - Then?
tell me, which horse do you like?
any horse will do?
Yes, ready!
sound!
take 7!
cut it man! Cut it!
what are you doing? What are you doing?
the girl's father is here! Can't you see such a huge man?
you have to stop the horse here. You have to get down.
it's so simple!
yes but it doesn't stop! - The horse won't stop on its own!
you have to stop it. You have to pull the bridle.
let's take one more shot.
sound. - Take 32!
come on!
Hey!
where is he? Cut it!
where are you?
here I am. Over here.
what are you doing over there in the middle?
the bride's father is here.
but the horse doesn't stop. What can I do?
Hey, what do you expect us to do? Cancel the shooting?
take the horses back again.
Hello!
Yes, we are coming! I told you we're coming.
don't make me angry!
now see, how he talks to him.
brother Uday is still stuck with his shooting.
why did you let D'Silva leave?
couldn't you make him wait for half an hour more?
which stupid person is barking out so loudly?
we are working here and he. Get out!
throw him out! Throw him out!
director! - What is this?
we are taking a shot and people are talking nonsense on the phone!
listen to me! - You keep quiet! - Forget it.
why are you standing speechless there? Is there a sound break? Sound.
take 57!
come on!
I have come to ask your daughter's hand.
cut it man! Cut it!
what are you doing?
I am down on my knees and. - Is this how you will ask her hand?
without stopping the horse, you will jump, fall down and ask?
will he give his consent for the marriage?
not on us but at least have mercy on the horses!
please, just one shot! Please!
hey you, take back the horses!
what stupid hero have I taken in my film?
that horse must also be thinking what a fool is riding him!
who is that fool?
brother Majnu!
brother Majnu!
Hey!
Rajiv, move aside.
who did you call a fool? Our brother Uday?
guys, stop all this shooting! - Please, listen to me!
you red matchstick. How dare you say that?
Uday will beg to the father? He won't allow them to marry?
no, it is not a matter of begging.
sometimes the horse has gone ahead, sometimes stayed back?
can't the father go to brother Uday?
where is the producer?
brother, he is here.
hold him!
brother Uday!
who did all this?
your brother Majnu! He beat up the director and the producer!
they were kicked, punched and beaten with shoes!
noses, jaws and heads were broken.
look at that! He has destroyed everything!
he has also destroyed your dream of being an actor.
director, say something!
pack up! - Pack up?
the film is discontinued! - Discontinued!
pack up, brother! You are finished!
he is jealous of me! Majnu!
in the same way, these guys will never reform.
I don't like all these five girls.
now I leave it up to you to decide whom will Rajiv marry now.
we had one chance of reforming brother but Majnu.
Sanjana, these guys are like crabs.
I guess it is our fate!
no Sanjana, brother Majnu will not decide our fate.
but we will decide about his fate.
your name itself is wrong, Mr. Majnu.
in fact your name should start with a 'S'.
Yes, my real name is Sagar. - There you go.
Mr. Sagar, can you pucker your brow.
did you fall in love with a girl when you were 18 years old?
don't feel shy. Look up!
can you again pucker your brow? Like this.
does that girl's name start with an 'l'?
isn't it right? - Yes.
Sanjana, the brothers of the girl with whom he had fallen in love had broken his legs and arms.
am I right?
they had just broken the arms.
my legs broke because l fell down in the gutter.
that's honesty! That's honesty!
because of lravati, you entered the crime world, right?
okay.
because her father asked you to become famous and earn money.
you murdered someone while trying to earn money and so you ran away only to reach here.
all that was in the past, Rajiv. What about the future?
that love will re-enter your life.
what will happen to the kids then? - What kids?
she has four kids!
if she comes into my life again, what will happen to her kids?
the kids will remain with here.
Iravati will not come back in your life.
a girl like lravati will come in your life and her name will start with an 'l'.
can you pucker your brow again?
no, don't scare me! Just a little.
Yes.
there! She should have been here already!
this painting! Why do you hide these in the house?
take them out.
brother, they will get wet if it rains outside.
I don't mean outdoors. I mean in some exhibitions or auctions.
moreover, when will I be of any help? I'll help you!
I will help you to auction them.
and because of your art you may, you know.
you will find the girl with a name starting with an 'l'.
all right!
and now, I present the painting of a new artist, Mr. Sagar.
well this painting is called, Rocking Horse!
we start the bid at 10, 000 dollars!
12! - 14, 000!
16, 000!
18, 000! - 18, 000!
22, 000!
25, 000 dollars! - 25, 000 dollars! 25, 000 dollars, one!
two. - 50, 000 dollars!
let's see if anybody goes ahead! 50, 000, one!
50, 000 dollars, two! 50, 000 dollars, three! Sold!
this painting is sold to, Miss lshika.
thank you.
miss lshika, what did you see in this painting that others didn't?
love!
I can look at the painting and tell that the artist is a lovable person.
there is a lot of love in his heart.
I mean look what a lovely message he has given through his painting.
Yes.
if one animal can carry the burden of another and love it so much!
then where has love disappeared from our lives?
you have a high thinking.
I really wish he were here. I wish I could meet him.
miss lshika, your wish has come true. The great artist is amongst us.
Mr. Sagar Pandey!
you too come with me! - Okay.
thank you.
Mr. Sagar, meet Miss lshika.
superb! Fantastic! I mean, mind blowing painting, Sagar.
I hope you don't mind me calling you Sagar. - No, I like it.
it is obvious!
I have bought paintings of great artists. It's my passion, you know.
but after seeing your painting, I have become your fan.
thank you.
I want your autograph!
do you have a pen?
sorry brother, I don't have.
beloved.
beloved.
looking at the painting I had thought a mature person must have made it.
but you're quiet young!
Bye.
boss, looks like she has fallen in love with you.
boss, you've created an excellent painting.
just the vermillion is missing.
Hello!
Yes! It is l. How are you?
I am fine. And you.
Sagar, I am terribly restless. Your painting doesn't let me sleep!
you may think I am shameless but l think I have fallen in love with you.
if you don't believe it then listen to my heartbeats!
Ishika, I am also in the same condition.
I'm staying awake just to make a painting for you.
I have also fallen in love with you.
liar! Let me hear your heartbeats!
Oh my Sagar, you are so sweet!
it's my birthday tomorrow. I am inviting you.
just you and me!
what is it? You've already started to dance?
what will you do when you get to ltaly?
Italy!
Yes, brother has fixed a meeting over there.
what happened? Aren't you happy? - Yes.
is there a problem?
a very big problem!
it's lshika's birthday tomorrow.
we have made plans to spend the evening together.
the matter has gone so far and we didn't even know about it.
everything is happening secretly! Very good!
Rajiv. - Yes.
do me a favour.
see brother Uday's palm and tell him that tomorrow's plans are canceled.
his life is in danger.
Mr. Sagar, don't feel bad but l should tell you that I never lie.
by the way, you have created this problem.
the shooting was going on smoothly and you unnecessarily beat up that director!
would he go to ltaly? - No, never!
Rajiv, isn't that director your friend?
please start the shooting again.
do you remember you had slapped him?
he is very stubborn. He will never listen.
why won't he? He surely will!
guys, come on!
this is what I don't like about you!
why do you get angry with such a small matter?
you can lovingly pacify that director.
Rajiv, now you don't get upset with me.
should I pacify him lovingly? I will.
by the way love is also so lovely!
drives me crazy.
does this beautiful face of yours.
o darling, your magic is such.
o darling, your magic is such.
just like dew drops shining in sunlight.
the day I met you, my whole life changed.
what have you done to me, O darling?
what have you done to me, O darling?
your face is bright like early morning.
your tresses are dark like the night.
darling, O my darling! I can die for you.
not only my heart I can also give you my soul.
your face is bright like early morning.
your tresses are dark like the night.
how much you mean to me, my sweetheart.
either I know or my god knows.
honey, what have you just said?
the day I met you, my whole life changed.
what have you done to me, O darling?
what have you done to me, O darling?
you're my love.
you're my life
I can't go, O, without you by my side.
you're my love.
your loveliness drives me crazy.
it casts a spell on me!
the secret of my heart that you have found out.
you don't know but you've taken away my life.
your loveliness drives me crazy.
it casts a spell on me!
you're in my thoughts all the time.
you're my trust. You're my companion.
honey, what have you just said?
honey, what have you just said?
the day I met you, my whole life changed.
what have you done to me, O darling?
what have you done to me, O darling?
what have you done to me, O darling?
what have you done to me, O darling?
what have you done to me, O darling?
sanjana weds Rajiv.
Sanjana, I still can't believe the impossible has happened.
but I had full faith in you.
that in order to acquire your love you will surely win this battle.
get up! - Lucky. Lucky. - What do you think of yourself!
lucky, listen.
how dare you straighten up our men, Majnu and Uday!
they were lost a bit. - Lucky, listen.
what do you.
sorry Lucky!
how dare you hit RDX's son?
I'm going to kill you!
lucky, no! - Get aside! I am going to finish you!
Sanjana, move aside.
you want to shut down our business. - Lucky, no.
lucky, listen to me. - You spoiled our men? - It will hurt you.
lucky, let Rajiv go or else!
or else what will you do? Will you shoot me?
I'll shoot! - Shoot me!
I'll not spare him! I'll not spare him! - Lucky, stop!
I only shot up.
I have killed Lucky.
did you hear me?
Sanjana, let's go.
come on.
he's still alive!
brother.
look, I am here. Everything will be all right.
Where's the party?
brother Rajiv, don't worry. I will take care of it.
here's the party.
sorry! Sorry!
sorry. - Hello. - Sorry. Sorry.
who did you shoot?
brother, actually. - I'll tell him everything. Sanjana, quiet!
I made a mistake.
I made a mistake.
brother Uday, we will be all dead. How do we pacify RDX?.
sir, don't worry about Mr. RDX. I have solved that problem.
I have told him that his son has been shot and he is in this hospital.
why did you tell him?
get lost from here. - I will kill you, rascal! I will kill you.
he wants to kill me even now!
what do you mean? - It means his time is up.
and he can die any moment now.
that means Mr. RDX won't get a chance to talk to his son.
so now we can tell him anything but the truth.
whatever you say, brother Uday. This girl is very intelligent.
thank you.
but doctor, he will surely die, wouldn't he?
I can guarantee it!
should I call up the crematorium and make a booking for him?
dad! Dad! Let my dad come!
Uday. Majnu. Look into my eyes!
tell me, how is Lucky?
he is. - No more!
No! No! This is impossible!
sir, have you also left us?
I'm not going anywhere! I am still alive!
take me to my son.
Mr. RDX may come here anytime now. Is everything ready?
uncle, is everything okay? - Yes.
lucky? - Confirmed dead!
I am still alive! I'm not dead yet! I'll kill each and every one of you!
he can run! - You also run!
what happened? Didn't you lose your leg? How come you are okay?
I always had my leg.
brother Uday has set me up for a reason.
if he wants to scare anyone, he calls me up to tell my story.
now run Ballu! - Yes, run!
why are you still holding the logs?
I will cremate him where we catch him!
he took my cycle! Why did you give him the cycle? - He stole it.
lucky can kill someone or get killed.
but he can never commit suicide!
stop. Stop, Lucky.
sir, do you think we will lie to you?
don't you trust us?
why did he commit suicide?
that secret is also gone with him, sir.
Hey! Hey, my phone. - One minute.
Hello! Lucky ran away from the crematorium! - Ran away?
who ran away?
the pundit, who was supposed to conduct the cremation.
ran away on hearing your name!
catch that rascal! - Yes.
heard what boss just said? Catch that rascal!
catch the rascal? Okay. Here.
rascal! - Dad. Dad, I am alive.
daddy! Daddy! - How did your daddy come here?
not my but Lucky's daddy! There he is going in that car!
daddy, I'm here!
daddy, I'm here!
I told him many times! Why is he taking his daddy to the crematorium!
why did you call RDX? But Rajiv, what should we do now?
we'll go home! Let's get to the crematorium!
who says Lucky isn't here?
where is he? I can't see him! Where is he?
he is standing right before me!
No! Do you think I'm crazy? I don't want to be the sacrificial goat!
brother-in-law, I would have lied instead of you.
but RDX has lost his son not a daughter!
and a sad father will directly fall on his dead son's chest.
Yes! No, I won't!
you can leave now! - Thank you, priest.
Oh, this was bound to happen.
he was going to form an alliance with the underworld.
Mr. Ghungroo!
but I can't see aunt and Rajiv anywhere.
nobody must have informed them.
aunt, Mr. Ghungroo is no more.
lucky, talk to me. Lucky, talk to me!
talk to me, Lucky!
what was lacking in my love? Tell me! Lucky, my son!
no uncle, you can't look at him! - Why can't l?
because it was Lucky's last wish!.
last wish?
why did Lucky say such a thing? - Why?
I will tell you.
that secret is also gone with him, sir.
can we ever lie to you?
don't you trust us, sir?
he came this way. He came this way.
what happened?
your uncle is great! He has taken all our troubles upon himself.
look at that.
uncle!
control.
uncle. - Rajiv, control.
why is he addressing my son as uncle?
not your son but he is addressing you as uncle.
everything will be fine. - What happened to uncle!
but why is he crying so much?
he is Lucky's buddy.
buddy? He was Lucky's close friend. I will pacify him!
Rajiv! - No, uncle is dead! No, he is still alive! - Who is still alive?
he is still alive in our hearts! Lucky still lives in our hearts!
uncle is still alive. Okay?
lucky! Where is he?
lucky. - Where is he?
he is hiding somewhere here. Who? - Lucky!
Majnu! Uday! - Yes. What is it?
even the pyre is calling out for the dead body!
I am dead! - Side please.
take it easy, aunt. - Ghungroo! - Take it easy.
take it easy. - Aunt's here.
aren't you ashamed?
were you trying to cremate him without informing me?
and then you pass signals? You are asking me to stay quiet?
let me cry at least on this day.
I am totally ruined!
why is this woman breaking her bangles here? I am ruined!
who is she? She is the wife of the dead body! Wife of the dead body?
when did Lucky get married? Why didn't he tell me?
maybe we'll never find about that secret.
Rajiv may surely know about this secret. - Yes.
Rajiv, you tell him. - What should I tell him?
what can I say? What can I say?
this girl belongs to a respectable family and they got married.
the girl's parents kept a condition that until the son's father.
that is you, leaves the underworld they can't get married.
what else can I say? - Enough! That's enough! Fine. - Sorry.
uncle, shall we carry him there? May his soul rest in peace!
may his soul rest in peace!
may his soul rest in peace!
may his soul rest in peace!
may his soul rest in peace! Are you really going to cremate me?
may his soul rest in peace!
uncle, it is quiet crowded. Get away quickly! Get away!
may his soul rest in peace! May his soul rest in peace!.
may his soul rest in peace!
may his soul rest in peace!
may his soul rest in peace!
may his soul rest in peace!
may his soul rest in peace!
why are you giving it to me?
when did you come?
I was the first to come here.
you were crying with your head on my chest.
over your chest?
yes sir. In sorrow nobody knows who is crying on whose chest.
sir.
he is alive!
Ishika look, he is alive!
this is called true love!
poor woman! Lucky's death has driven her crazy.
lucky? Lucky, who?
uncle! Uncle! Light the pyre and set us free. Please.
may his soul rest in peace!
may his soul rest in peace!
may his soul rest in peace!
miracle! Miracle! Miracle! - Yes, miracle.
miracle! Miracle!.
Miracle!.
miracle.
how did all this happen? What happened?
nothing happened, dad.
dad look, what they have done to me?
they are all scoundrels! They shot me here, dad!
they shot me!
dad, they tried to shoot your son.
dad!
welcome!
welcome, my friends! Welcome!
Ranvir Dhanraj Xaka! The other name of terror and death!
you have conspired to burn my son alive.
sir, we did not know Lucky was hiding under the pyre! - Yes.
is a pyre a hiding place?
sir, will we ever lie to you? - Don't you trust us?
if you ever speak of trust and belief then I'll.
all this has happened because of me and because of my love.
if you have to then punish me not them.
Rajiv, the punishment has been fixed.
you had played one game with us.
now we will play a game with you.
when the music stops whoever is holding the parcel has to sing.
isn't that the game?
say hello to him! - Hello.
we are experts in this game. - But I have changed one rule in it.
along with singing you also have to dance. We know the variation.
when the music stops, whoever is holding this parcel will be thrown into the deep valley below!
be careful.
be ware as you will not get another chance.
wherever you hide, it will find you.
this is love, this will finish you.
finish.
sir, your man! Black man.
who told you to join this game? - This man!
shut up!
sorry, sir. - Rules are rules my friend!
I can't go back on my word.
you have to die.
he is trapped!
as per my information there should not have been anyone here.
but there's a party going on!
trapped.
sir, what should we do now? - We'll do what we came here to do.
but sir, there are many people in there.
all of them are criminals. Each one has a bounty on his head.
do one thing. Drop the house in the valley.
we can count the total bounty later.
he is trapped!
he is trapped!
sir.
lucky! Are you crazy?
to save his lover he was not passing it so I took it.
but you stopped the music at that same instance, dad.
dad, this is not fair!
Mr. Ghungroo. What will RDX do now? - What can he do?
he had said rules are rules! Right? - Correct, Mr. Ghungroo!
in the underworld, RDX is well known for bestowing justice.
once he says anything, it is the final word.
RDX has never gone back on his word. And he won't now.
but if he goes back because of his son.
then his image will be tarnished in the underworld.
brother, it takes a lifetime to earn respect.
but one moment is enough to lose it.
and since Lucky is holding the parcel, that moment has arrived.
parcel! Parcel! Parcel!
sir, if you want to change your decision then do it.
we can understand. This is your son. Your blood.
nobody will tell this to anybody.
what do you mean? To tell or not to tell.
if there is cheating in this game then I won't play. I'm leaving.
justice will be done!
I will do justice.
I know if I let my son stay alive then.
I would lose respect in the underworld.
but I would lose respect if any one of you leaves this place alive.
nephew!
what have you all done? It fell half.
sir, it will fall. - What if it doesn't?
run!
help me. Somebody help me. Help!
go that side. Go!
we all are here. Brace yourself.
move aside.
take care of your sister-in-law.
don't worry.
hey come in the middle.
he bit me! Leave me.
darling, come into my arms.
my dear, take care of your sister-in-law.
Yes. Yes.
come here
stop it!
I'll kill you. - Everyone come in the middle.
come in the middle everybody.
Rajiv, stop it. - Uncle, not behind, but come in the middle.
Sanjana, this way. - Come on, Sanjana.
everybody come.
dad, they tried to fire me, dad. - It is a lie.
everybody stand in the middle. Everybody stand in the middle.
hey you fool! What have you done?
stop! - RDX, have you gone mad? Have you gone mad?
I found it. I found a spray to kill them.
spray it on my face!
over here! Over here!
over here. Over here.
I can't see! I am blind!
Oh my leg!
my eyes are burning! - Wear these goggles!
your eyes will stay cool! If you lose your eyes, how will you see me?
brother, I am telling you. Catch hold of RDX.
somehow try to make him fall in the valley.
if he is safe, even we will be safe.
who is talking?
I am Majnu speaking.
Hey, he is lying. Sir, your Majnu is here.
nobody will survive! Where are you throwing the rope?
we are doomed!
Sanjana, let's go! Hold on! - Rajiv, how are you?
don't worry about me. Just move!
hey Nephew, do you want to kill me?
careful. - Hey, where are you?
don't go all at once! All of us will die!
let everybody die! But she must survive.
hey nephew, will you come and save me after I die?
move! Lucky, come on!
careful. Careful.
get down. Now, get down.
daddy. Save me, daddy.
somebody save my son!
somebody save my brother, please!
somebody save my son! - Please, save me, dad.
Rajiv, stop! Rajiv, come back!
Rajiv! - Stop him!
Rajiv! Rajiv, don't be foolish! - I can't live without him!
God has given us everything. Wealth, fame and respect.
Rajiv, stop!
help me, daddy!
if he is punished for my sins then I will hate myself forever.
what do you mean? - He did not shoot Lucky but I did.
but he took the blame on himself so that I may not face any trouble.
lucky, grab the rope!
get it!
towards the door!
careful. - Come on.
are you okay?
no Rajiv! - Sanjana!
no Rajiv! No!
Rajiv, I hate you! - Sanjana!
you cheated me!
you betrayed me. - Sanjana, stop.
I hate him!
what happened?
why did you slap me?
lucky, you are so lucky!
dad, I owe my life to him!
Rajiv, good deeds are always greater.
.than bad ones.
you have won RDX's heart!
ask me! What do you want?
you should also leave this world of sin and crime.
there is nothing to gain from it. This world needs love not hatred.
decorate this city like a bride!
Why?
because I will myself get Rajiv and Sanjana married.
just take care!
along with them, get us married as well.
we have also fallen in love! - Yes.
that's all right. But first introduce me to the bride.
buy one get one free!
hey Majnu, why are you holding your sister-in-law's arm? Leave it!
what are you saying, brother Uday?
I really don't like jokes. I am telling you. - What nonsense?
let go off your sister-in-law's arm! I am not joking.
you are holding your sister-in-law's arm!
she is my lsha! - She is my lshika!
Isha, tell him! - lshika, explain it to him!
come on tell him! - Tell him!
Rajiv, tell them.
what actually happened was. Sir, these two guys.
run Sanjana! Run!
why did they run away? - I'll go ask them!
brother Uday, why are they running away?
they played such a big prank on us!
I have changed but l will not spare Rajiv.
if you do, I will not spare you!
God has given us everything! Wealth, fame and respect.
all I need is a bride! Rajiv!
welcome!
everybody come, welcome! Welcome!
to the party, come, welcome.
welcome!
everybody come, welcome!.
welcome!
to the party, come, welcome.

there's another girl for everyone.

welcome!
to the party, come, welcome. Welcome!
there's another girl for everyone.
welcome! Welcome! Welcome!
love is intoxication.
come on, dance with me tonight.
what do I do of this heart?
it is crazy about you.
don't torment me anymore.
come on, dance with me right now.
this moment is for merriment.
why are you so restrained?
don't you really want to come?
welcome!
welcome!
welcome!
to the party, come, welcome.

welcome!
everybody come, welcome! Welcome!
my name is Leonardo da Vinci.
you're the eccentric that Verrocchio employs.
I'm an artist and an anatomist and an engineer of some note.
search for the Book of Leaves. Fate has chosen you.
where do I start my search?
the hanged man.
the Jew that was hanged - I want to unearth his body.
my mistress insisted that you be the one to capture her beauty.
I sense the Vatican's hand behind this.
you need weapons of your own, Your Magnificence.
this will greatly increase your firepower.
the Medicis have employed him to design siege weapons.
you know this how? - I have an agent within Lorenzo's ranks.
he told you time is a river?
he told me the river was circular.
that one man's death paves the way for the birth of another.
indeed, and men like ourselves, we can change the river's course.
I'm like you, then?
I find that hard to believe.
you don't know who I am, do you?
my brother and I... Your bandits tried to take my honor.
where? - Down the path, to the left.
Hurry! - This way.
in you go. Go on, in.
alright.
you should be safe in there.
come on.
I'm sorry - the fools locked the gate.
the fools are worth worrying about.
a locked gate... not so much.
there is no yesterday, you see.
no tomorrow.
time is all one single continuum.
we have met, haven't we?
of course. We're brothers.
who are you?
start with your heel, roll to your toe.
I already have a maestro.
keep da Vinci's counsel, but enhance it.
there.
what is it?
they don't like their graves being violated, so they cover them in sand and letters to alert them of mischief.
what does it say?
funnily enough... 'Taken.'
I'm a son of earth and starry heaven.
I'm thirsty.
please... give me something to drink from the fountain of memory.
see, as I have seen... into infinity... and you will be a god.
but know this.
you will... suffer.
one corpse.
freshly plucked.
was it a nightmare, maestro?
no, it was something else entirely.
take notes, would you?
I perceive the expected marks from strangulation.
crushed larynx.
diminished musculature. Likely from malnutrition.
circumcised member.
I've never seen one of those before.
what is that?
a missing fingernail, on the right digitus primus.
Leo, what are you doing?
the Turk said to start my quest with a hanged man.
specifically, the seat of the soul.
it's a euphemism for the stomach.
the missing fingernail.
odd that he would ingest it.
one man's death opens the doorway for another.
did your husband give you that?
it's a family heirloom.
from Ceylon.
it's a stone called Serendibite.
what's troubling you?
count Riario is coming to pay us a visit.
for what purpose?
Oh, nothing pleasant, I'm sure.
but I'll be expected to wine and dine him, whilst hosting the rest of Florence's elite.
will you come?
you can keep Riario entertained.
will Clarice be there?
of course.
we can steal glances throughout the evening.
I'll even invite that scoundrel, if you like.
da Vinci.
the one who's supposed to be painting your portrait And building me a weapon.
you're late, son.
contract - signed.
and now binding.
did you not even read it? - We'd agreed the terms.
but not the administration of those terms.
I told you to stay away.
I let you know there would be consequences.
what do you think you've done?
painting Lucrezia Donati, fraudulently leading the Medicis to believe you can deliver preposterous weapons.
you've overreached, and now I've made it so you'll soon be gone.
there isn't a contract you can devise that can contain me.
you're the bastard son of a servant girl I spilled my seed into.
your heritage contains you.
No!
what's wrong? - What's changed?
something's shifted in you since last we met.
perhaps it's just you and me here in Lorenzo's home.
feeling guilty?
it's not as if I don't have affection for him.
or perhaps...
I'm guilty about feeling guilty.
it's not as if I don't have affection for you as well.
which guilt do you prefer, then?
I have known Lorenzo since I was a girl. I've known you a week.
that's not an answer. - Well...
the Jew they executed...
what was his offence?
he said he had to run from cut-throats... and he took refuge in a bookstore.
the authorities suspect he stole something, but nothing was missing, and the bag he carried was empty.
so, they hanged a man... for stealing something that wasn't missing.
the scene of the crime requires further investigation.
does it?
prepare the horses!
I want to be off at once.
you've finished already?
Yes. Signor da Vinci had somewhere to be.
Ah, yes. He's testing his gun for us.
today he gives Florence its sting... while I show him mine.
it's quite considerate he left us a moment to be alone.
Lorenzo, anybody could walk in.
I just needed a bit of you.
and you will have it... for it is yours alone.
good luck today. - We're off!
good luck.
that bit of you... It's not his alone.
no... it's not.
but it will always be his first.
do you have any saltpeter?
what do you need potassium nitrate for?
gunpowder. The maestro's designing a weapon.
he calls it the pipe-organ musket.
the recoil will kill him.
don't worry. He's worked it out.
by God... he's corrupted you already.
over there, third shelf, between the vermillion and the ultramarine.
and tell him I expect to be paid in coin, not idle boasts, like last time.
come on.
God! - Careful, Giuliano.
fucking hell! What are we doing here, in the middle of nowhere?
where is he? - Perhaps he's simply late.
or perhaps he realized what he proposed was more than a flying party trick.
I wouldn't be surprised if he had no intention of coming here.
I'm telling you - the man's a lunatic and a coward.
God! Shit!
keep control of yourself - they're only cut-outs.
quickly! Soldiers advancing on Florence!
how... how dare you?
you are pointing a weapon at the house of Medici! Men, take him!
hold. - It passed its first test.
it's done nothing. - No, it's done a great deal.
intimidation.
now, if you will proceed to the gallery...
we will proceed to testing its less ephemeral utility.
you've picked quite a day for it.
Yes. You like it?
I think it adds to the verisimilitude.
I question the company the maestro keeps.
that man's a known reprobate.
are these soldiers meant to be Swiss?
and you would be...?
commander Quattrone, leader of the Florentine militia.
his Magnificence thought it wise to bring a military strategist along.
in order to better evaluate your work.
I wish I'd brought a boat. - Well, he has a keen eye.
what you see here is a representation of Rome's private mercenary regiment.
it's a bit of theatrics, but often presentation is more than half the performance.
well, get on with it, da Vinci.
while you delay, we drown.
where was I? - Yes. Come on.
quickly! Soldiers advancing on Florence!
Yes, yes, yes. - The man is mad.
the house of Medici has invested hundreds of florins in this project.
according to your contract, the failure of this contraption constitutes fraud.
men, take him away.
on your feet, maestro.
hold.
you have one week, artista.
Lorenzo, no.
the materials alone will cost another 200 florins.
one week.
that sounds... quite reasonable.
I'm gonna have words with you, boy.
we found footprints in the graveyard where the Jew's body was stolen.
a donkey's, a man's and a child's.
Long-toed poulaines... such as you are wearing.
do you know who I am?
I am Lord Girolamo Riario.
count and Captain General of the Holy Roman Church.
nephew of His Holiness... Pope Sixtus IV.
Signor Morgante has informed us of your grave-robbing exploits.
I don't know what you mean. - Don't insult us, boy.
we're well aware of who your master is.
erm... Your Excellency, there was the matter of payment.
Yes, of course.
captain Grunwald.
Jesus!
now that we've established my propensity for directness,
I trust our conversation will proceed smoothly.
now, we're interested in why da Vinci required the Jew's body, and, lest you be tempted to feign further ignorance,
I wanted to demonstrate a remarkable device I recently acquired from the Orient.
it's called... the Widow's Tear.
No!
the source of the discomfort you're feeling is an exquisitely tooled diamond needle, the titular Widow's Tear.
and as I turn the handle, the diamond... slowly incises a circle of skin, from the back of the hand, one layer of epidermis at a time.
now, I want you to weigh your next answer very, very carefully.
why did da Vinci unearth the Jew's body?
very well. Another turn.
stop! Stop, stop.
Shhh, shhh. It's alright, Nico.
just a few simple words, and we can end all this unpleasantness.
he was searching... The Jew swallowed something.
what, child?
a key.
leave nothing unturned. Just find the key.
rip it apart!
stop!
you won't find it.
that's what you're looking for.
open it. - I can't. It's locked.
hack it apart.
wait a moment!
let's get out of here! Hurry!
let's get out of here!
you, boy...! You...!
you have defied instruments of the Lord's will!
Leonardo!
go! Go!
Leonardo! Are you alright?
Oh, merciful heaven! What happened here?
these men are agents of the papacy.
what, it wasn't enough to tangle with the Medicis? Now you're...?
Leo, you're talking about the Pope.
not to worry. They could only have our entrails torn out.
Nico, who did this to you?
count Riario.
the papal nephew and attack dog?
he snatched me from the market.
I told him... I'm sorry.
I told him you took the key from the Jew's body.
well, you may have told them that, but you showed them something else.
Hey, you've done something exceptional, Nico.
you've saved your own life, into the bargain.
Halt!
be still.
our visitor was expected.
you know I can't be seen with you.
there are too many prying eyes.
if I had been stopped on the road...
you needn't lecture me on the necessity of discretion.
I wouldn't jeopardize such a valuable asset as yourself without ample reason.
now, take these.
a list of secure locales hidden throughout Florence.
I need more information.
details of Lorenzo and da Vinci's activities.
if you have something pertinent to convey, inscribe the Greek letter alpha above whichever locale is convenient.
if we have something to convey to you, we will inscribe the letter omega.
are you clear on all this?
that's the official papal seal.
mark your messages with it.
and one final thing.
what is it?
instructions will be forthcoming.
in the meantime, keep it hidden.
now, da Vinci... Has your celebrated artist made any mention of a key?
what about the Jew? - He asked about his capture.
he wanted to return to the scene of the crime.
that's how he put it.
he was preoccupied with why a Jew would hide in a bookshop.
why would da Vinci concern himself with a bookshop?
I don't know. Perhaps da Vinci is more clever than you.
but then that would be heresy, wouldn't it?
keep an eye on that bookshop.
if we're lucky, da Vinci will complete our investigations for us.
and you, Miss Donati, do continue ensnaring Lorenzo and da Vinci with that...
pretty little cunt of yours.
you're a bastard. - Yes.
and the architect of my pedigree is the Holy Father himself.
now, go, lest the prying eyes of Florence see us together and question your already compromised character.
she grows more impertinent with every encounter.
even a mouse occasionally bears its teeth when it's about to be crushed.
Scudos, the papal currency.
let's review the events again, da Vinci.
they took the boy and ransacked your workshop.
what were they looking for?
my weapon designs.
well, let Rome have them.
by this time next week, they'll have decimated themselves.
by this time next week, they could decimate US!
Lorenzo... - Open your eyes, brother!
we no longer enjoy Milan's protection.
I want your men to surround this building.
no-one to come in or out, save da Vinci and the boy.
you will accompany da Vinci wherever he goes.
Oh, I hardly think that's necessary!
go.
you have three days for a successful fire of your gun.
if it fails, there will be no second chances.
there will be no trial. You will hang.
whatever you need to accomplish this you will possess.
money, materials, men.
make your vision real, da Vinci... for your very life.
when the black hood pulls the lever... be sure to clench.
those guards are going to make it difficult to sneak off to the tavern.
did you hear what he said? - Yes.
I need to think.
and if I need to think, I need to drink.
this place is wonderful.
so much better than the convent.
a million thanks to you, Leonardo.
what are you doing?
I'm trying to envisage what kind of lock the notches on this key correspond to.
Nico, do you have that coin the Turk gave you?
I thought so.
two keys.
whatever lock this corresponds with, I'd wager the key represents only half of the mechanism needed to open it.
Leo, honestly, who cares?
just give the damn thing to Riario.
inspiration can't be forced.
Oh, well, tell that to the hangman-- Inspiration cannot be forced Look, the fact that Riario would jeopardize a formal visit to acquire this is telling.
obviously, it's linked to the Book of Leaves. The Turk confirmed it.
of course, the Turk. Your mystery man.
Yes! And since we have a mystery here... I intend to see it through.
what mystery? The Jew stole a key.
he swallowed it to prevent his pursuers from getting it.
why would he break into a bookshop?
that's where the key was in the first place. That's why he broke in.
no, the narrative doesn't hold up.
the bookshop reported nothing missing.
Oh, for fuck's sake! - And his bag was empty.
and why the fingernail? And why was the Jew being pursued... before the bookshop?
according to the Count, the Jew crossed the piazza and then entered the road here.
perhaps someone witnessed the event.
please, signor, can you offer any charity?
tell me, good man.
were you here the night the Jew was caught?
indeed I was, for this is my home, and I have no other.
can't you see this man's blind?
a florin, signor?
you could identify that by its sound?
I am well versed in the respective tones of our realm's coinage.
if you would, could you describe what you heard that night?
with pleasure. It was a cold night.
when I first heard the shouts, I thought I was dreaming.
they were coming from the Duomo.
then I heard the Jew's footsteps and his breath.
he was terrified. I could tell that.
then he fell.
dropped something. Pages fluttering like bird's wings.
then I heard the Jew say,'Wo, wo?' Wo, wo?
and I heard more shouts, his pursuers calling after him.
I did not understand a word they said, except for 'halt'.
halt.
how does this shed light on your mystery?
the men chasing the Jew spoke a foreign tongue, yet they used the word 'halt'.
only German and English use that.
so...? - So, the Swiss mercenaries employed by Rome speak German, and they must have assumed the Jew understood it, since most Jews speak Yiddish, a form of German.
the word 'wo' in Yiddish means 'where'.
the Jew wasn't fearful. He was searching for something.
see, I believe he had two items in his possession.
the first was small enough for him to swallow - the key.
the second was larger, forcing him to find a hiding-place.
a book. - Precisely.
and where would one best hide a book?
would you mind skulking around, making the proprietor apprehensive?
why me?
well, because you reek of dishonesty.
as usual.
Signor Vesticci, how goes it?
tell me - how many rows of shelves do you have?
ten. What of it?
you there - did you just stuff something into your robes just now?
I beg your pardon? I was simply hefting the weight of this tome.
the fingernail was a clue to the second item's location.
ten shelves. Ten fingers.
now, we're facing the west.
it would be more obvious, when counting, to face the opposite direction, the east and the rising sun.
additionally, Hebrew is the sacred language of the Jews, read from right to left.
so, if we count from the right... we get row number five.
blood.
now, we know he bit off his fingernail.
look, Nico. There.
dust. No-one's disturbed these books in ages.
but here...
there's no dust at all on this book.
written in Hebrew, no less.
I think we've found item number two.
I take it all back. If you had tits, I'd marry you.
so, you long for the soul of a man but the breasts of a woman?
you have a treacherous road ahead, my friend.
Artista, you will come with us.
if you resist... Well, just ask your little friend about Riario's hospitality.
well, unfortunately, we will have to decline the Count's invitation.
what is that?
well, you're acquainted with my infernal devices.
the exploding chest, in my workshop.
well, this works on the same principle.
it is a grenade. It's packed with gunpowder.
activated by a push-button on its base.
and if I remove my thumb... the device will explode.
he's lying. It's a snuff-box.
don't test my resolve. I do not care for you to die, on this day or any other.
you think the greatest mind in all of Europe needs to bluff? Then try us.
there's a vendor nearby that sells those things.
this is da Vinci you're staring down.
it's a snuff-box. - It's a fucking grenade.
fuck me. - Split up.
after him!
Halt! You won't get away from us!
Halt!
Halt!
Oh, please, give Riario my regrets!
count Riario, if you'd be so kind.
Signor di Medici.
lady Orsini.
thank you most humbly for the hospitality you've extended to our modest delegation.
we are only too happy to receive Rome's favored son.
lord Girolamo.
we are ecstatic.
shall you and I retire to my study for a few moments?
drop the niceties, Riario.
your men broke into my artist's studio. I want to know why.
word of da Vinci has reached the Holy Father's ears.
he's tasked me with finding artisans to adorn the great chapel he's building.
I thought... Do you know what?
an exploratory meeting might be in order.
and was the death of your men part of that exploration?
only retroactively, but it taught me a few things about your man and made me anxious to make his acquaintance.
da Vinci is a mere dilettante.
an amusement. Nothing more.
and yet I'm told you've advanced him a stipend of 50 florins.
quite a handsome allowance for a mere dilettante.
Rome hears every whisper, Lorenzo.
even outlandish ones concerning artisans capable of constructing war machines.
the manufacture of armaments could be construed as a provocative move.
as could the assassination of Duke Sforza.
or the refusal to pay one's debts.
usury. It's such an unseemly business.
I hear the Holy Father is now borrowing money from the Pazzi family.
is he planning on bilking them as well?
since we're on the subject of provocations,
I believe it's time I stated the purpose of my visit.
his Holiness wishes to inform you of his choice for the Archbishop of Pisa.
pisa falls under Florence's jurisdiction.
nevertheless, the selection has been made.
his Holiness has appointed Francesco Salviati.
your cousin.
well... It appears congratulations are in order.
please, inform the Holy Father that you and Salviati should assemble the largest army you can find...
because the only way you're setting foot in Pisa is if I am dead and buried.
I see.
so, that's your proposed condition?
Rome fired the first salvo, not I.
and we intend to fire the last.
good night, Magnifico.
how in Christ's name did he know all that?
troubling.
you look very fetching in your night shirt.
what are you doing, skulking around? I could have hurt you.
with a drafting compass?
why are you here, Leonardo?
I can't go to my quarters. The Vatican's thugs are looking for me.
Lorenzo's men have been in and out of here all day, looking for you.
Lorenzo gave me a deadline on my musket.
frankly, I'm not sure I can make it.
I'm not surprised.
you have three layers of cannons on top of one another. Yes?
well, there's going to be some powder contamination between the tiers.
look, I promised Lorenzo a musket that could be fired and loaded simultaneously.
this is a dangerous game you're playing with Lorenzo. Have you overreached?
Christ, Andrea! The whole point of progress is overreaching.
why doesn't anyone understand that?
drink.
now, do you want to tell me what this is all really about?
have you heard of the Book of Leaves?
it's a myth. No more real than a unicorn.
I believe it exists.
a book of wonders, containing the secret history of the world? Please!
the Jew that was hanged.
this was his.
your Hebrew's better than mine. Perhaps you can tell me what it concerns.
it's... it's a treatise on the origins of the universe.
astronomy.
it keeps referring to the Vault of Heaven, how it can be opened.
or perhaps... Ah-ha.
so, the Vault of Heaven could refer to the night sky.
so, perhaps the Book can be found by looking for a constellation.
Leo, give up on this fool's errand and focus on your commission.
stop borrowing trouble based on a fable.
this fable... is bound up in the fate of my mother.
I can draw anything I've seen, Andrea. Anything.
but I can't draw her face.
I've tried. I can't.
I can't. I just can't remember it.
if there's any knowledge to be had of her bound up in this quest...
I need to see it through.
then your need will most likely end up getting you killed.
he told me the linens were from Naples.
isn't that right, dear?
me, a textile merchant.
I suggested he start getting his wine from the Orient, while he's at it.
shouldn't you be working on Lorenzo's musket?
well, unlike you, I'm capable of doing two things at the same time.
drinking and digging your own grave.
yours.
the question you asked of me earlier.
which gift do I prefer?
you seem very uncomfortable.
I don't often attend affairs such as this.
well, I do. It's a confection of pretence and masks.
smile. Lorenzo's watching us.
your pardons and indulgences. Your pardons and indulgences.
welcome, all of you... to a feast of Florence, so full of life and vibrancy.
so like Eden.
full of fresh fruits.
full of bird and game.
full of nature's grace.
so like Eden... but, of course, Eden had guests.
as do we.
of course, our guest is somewhat more pleasant than the serpent.
please let us welcome Count Girolamo Riario, emissary from Rome, to our Eden, to our Florence.
dinner is served.
what do you see?
I know who you are; You know who I am. We both know what's transpired.
now, tell me: what do you see?
I believe I saw someone call you a snake in front of all those people.
and I see a key that you will be giving to me... along with what you took from that bookstore.
well, both the key and the book the Jew hid are quite useless, unless one has the intellect required to find the Vault of Heaven.
then I'll have you as well. - Why would I surrender myself to Rome?
perhaps you value your life?
not enough to betray Florence.
then... perhaps you value the life of another a little more.
I know desire when I see it, and I am very well versed in the myriad ways of exploiting it.
you know, this doesn't have to be contentious, da Vinci.
join us, and the whole of the Vatican's secret archives can be at your disposal.
you're offering me forbidden fruit now.
that's what serpents do, isn't it?
meet me tomorrow at sunrise.
and then the key, all of its secrets... can be yours.
and your services?
surely, if I'm to find the Book of Leaves, I'll need those, as well?
what is he doing? - He's playing with a bottle.
of course he is.
I'll admit he eluded us once, but this time we're ready for him.
there. It makes sense.
he was already working with the Roman scum.
do we need any more proof?
he is complicit with them.
consider this a retainer.
for your services to Rome.
why do you hesitate, da Vinci?
this is the next step.
sorry. I don't follow you.
why did you exhume the Jew?
why do you endeavor to find the Vault?
I don't endeavor.
I've found it.
the Vault of Heaven, which, presumably, contains the Book of Leaves.
I've had it put on wheels, so I might move it for safekeeping.
apparently, it requires two keys to open.
the Jew. The Vault. The Book.
you've done all this, because you want to know what's next.
between the base animal clawing for money and the enlightened man's reach for God lies knowledge.
you just want to know what's next. I do too.
Oh, that's not what you want.
you want to suppress knowledge.
no. I want to administer it.
someone has to. Why not an agent of God?
well, if God exists, surely, He intended His knowledge to be shared by all?
the truth is, progress frightens you and your ilk.
not at all. We embrace it.
Really?! Really?
are we at an impasse, then?
that would be unfortunate.
this is your last chance for an amicable partnership.
I decline your offer.
I pledge allegiance to Lorenzo the Magnificent, his foolish brother, and the whole of Florence!
you want to tame Florence, but I prefer it wild, for all its quirks and criminals.
so, why don't you scurry on back to Rome and tell your Pope that neither Florence nor da Vinci will be contained?
you hurt my friend!
go! Run, you fools!
I'm sorry.
I did warn you.
why aren't we meeting at the palace?
I come here to retreat from public life.
and the words I would have with you aren't meant to be public.
I believe there may be a spy in my court.
Riario knew the details of our arrangement, the exact amount of the stipend I've advanced you.
you suspect my allegiance?
no.
no, the fact that you just killed six of the papal guard releases you from the circle of suspicion.
no, you wanted me to witness your meeting with Riario today, didn't you?
what makes you say that?
well, you managed to evade my officers, even though I insisted they watch over you, and then today, conveniently, you slip up.
you intended for us to track you to the quarry.
I thought you'd appreciate seeing the gun work on real opponents, not wooden ones.
how did you fix the gun's flaws?
the cannons needed more separation, so the rotating drum I fashioned did just that.
and can your musket now be produced on a large scale?
well, given the resources, absolutely.
then you will have them.
you have done well, da Vinci.
we struck Riario quite a blow today.
but it won't be long before he retaliates.
Lorenzo, we don't have much...
I thought we were alone. - It's all right, Lucrezia.
it's only da Vinci.
and I trust we can rely on his discretion.
Absolutely.
good man.
get to work, maestro.
Florence is counting on you.
why do you laugh?
one day, Lupo, all that you see here will fall under Rome's rule.
and if that day happens a bit further down the road, because of da Vinci's intervention... so be it.
but he has the key.
that makes him one step closer to obtaining the Book of Leaves.
let him keep it for now. At least we know where it is.
and besides... the key is useless without its counterpart.
and what if da Vinci obtains that?
he won't.
how do you know?
because I have it!
and now you know, dear Lupo... why I find the whole affair so amusing.
why the long face, Leo?
the maestro's never satisfied.
the possibility of perfection, another puzzle looming over the horizon.
how many letters are in the Hebrew alphabet?
27
there are 27 illustrations in this book.
so...?
have you gone mad?
help me move this table back.
hebrew, as we've already established, is written from right to left.
if the first illustration corresponds with the first page of the alphabet...
and the second page corresponds with the second...
Beth. - And the third page follows the same pattern... Gimel.
do you see how the gold lines up from one page to the next?
have you heard of steganography?
it's cryptography developed by the Greeks.
it means 'concealed writing'.
it's basically hiding a coded message in plain sight.
leaves in a forest. - Make a grid of three rows, each of them nine across...
what is it? - Patience, Nico.
as with most puzzles... it needs to be viewed from a different perspective.
the Vault of Heaven isn't a metaphor.
it's an actual vault, containing the Book of Leaves.
and that, gentlemen, is a map, detailing the vault's location.
the land this describes doesn't exist.
well, then, we'll just have to discover it, won't we?
we are known as the Sons of Mithras.
ignis fatuus, that's what this Sons of Mithras business is.
if I marry Camilla Pazzi...
you and I can still snatch a little freedom here and there.
do we kill Lorenzo coming up the path?
strike only when the brothers are together.
Lucrezia Donati?
saddle the horses for Siena. We'll question her directly.
and here's our final savior. - Gentlemen.
what possesses you to betray Lorenzo, to betray us all?
you are Lucrezia Donati's father. - Indeed.
L'Artista, I see you escaped.
and I see a key.
cosimo de Medici was a Son of Mithras.
a ship provisioned for a journey.
the Vault of Heaven is out there.
constantinople, 13 years ago.
Allahu Akbar.
Allahu Akbar.
what does the future hold for the Sons of Mithras, Al-Rahim?
augury is a tricky business.
I see grim tidings.
darkness, despair.
the usual cant and caper, then.
you would make light of our circumstances, Cosimo de Medici?
light is the only thing that sustains me, my friend.
are there no bright spots on the horizon, then?
there is one, a boy from Vinci.
he has promise.
even now, events conspire to bring him to Florence.
am I to keep an eye on him?
only from a distance.
he must ascend or fall by his own devices.
and speaking of devices, we give you this for safe-keeping.
someone will come for this when it is time to make the journey.
perhaps, the boy Al-Rahim speaks of.
assuming he survives his trial.
I have faith he will.
if I'm to keep the candles burning,
I'll need more reassurances than faith and a vague prophecy.
I'm afraid I cannot give you any reassurances.
if the future indicated by these signs comes to pass, only one of us will live to see it.
so which lucky one gets to survive?
you misunderstand.
the dead will be the lucky ones.
the one who lives to see this future... he will truly suffer.
I'm going to miss this place.
and you. I'll miss you as well, my friends.
we've followed you into more scrapes than I care to count.
why not add another to the tally?
I can't ask you to follow me across an ocean.
we want to, Maestro.
the Vault of Heaven, the Book of Leaves, we want to be there when you find them.
the boy's a half-wit moon-calf who'd smother his balls in ox dung if you told him to.
as for me? I've accrued some gambling debts that make my near-term residence in Florence problematic.
so where to next? We'll need a ship, won't we?
the Portuguese are establishing trade routes along Western Africa.
we'll book passage to the Canary Islands.
after that, we'll have to improvise.
first, I've certain accounts to settle with the House of Medici.
why bother with the Medicis? Why not skirt Florence entirely?
there are things I have to say to Lorenzo.
words for his ears alone.
shall we meet at the Barking Dog this evening?
why not? A pint, one last foray into a Florentine slit for luck.
we can see if Nico's balls have dropped.
that's odd.
that's a Lanner Falcon.
they're rare this side of the Adriatic.
turkey, Africa, yes. But here?
it lost its way. It happens. - No, not often.
the last time I saw a Lanner was the day my mother disappeared.
you say they hail from Turkey?
I'll wager that bird's an omen, meant for you alone.
I should follow it.
I said it's an omen.
if anything, you should ride in the opposite direction.
I'll meet you at the Dog. - Leo!
I take it you now believe in visions... and demons?
where can be Giuliano be?
how badly did you handle your talk with him about this marriage?
he knew he had to wed the girl.
he agreed there was no other way to halt our feud with the Pazzis, yet I've not seen a trace of him for days.
did you actually hear him utter the words,"I agree," or did you only hear what you wanted to hear?
he agreed.
Giuliano may not arrive at all.
I say we strike.
kill Lorenzo and Clarice while we have them here.
are you so blind to the success of your rivals?
the brothers are popular.
murdering only one will allow the survivor to rally the city against us.
only with the shock of losing both men at once will Florence bow to new leaders.
you can send your men after Giuliano, wherever he is.
I can handle Lorenzo myself.
do so and you defy the will of Rome, Francesco.
I warn you now.
remarkable.
according to lore, these will open the Vault of Heaven.
solomon Ogbai, the Abyssinian, told you its location?
he told me it rested on an old peak, in a town made of stone.
beneath something called "the hitching post of the sun."
with these keys and the map to the Vault itself, it would appear the Book of Leaves lies firmly within our grasp.
when was the last time the Book was actually seen?
a thousand years ago.
when the Library of Alexandria burned.
yet we still have faith it exists.
faith.
it always comes down to that, doesn't it?
never anything that can be proven. Just... It's just smoke.
it's tales by the camp fire.
you're angry.
Pope Sixtus claims you're an agent of the Ottomans.
the Sons of Mithras are not constrained by geographic borders.
our stewardship encompasses all mankind.
well, this particular man is tired of being manipulated.
if you are lost in a forest and you see a landmark, is that landmark manipulating you along a certain path?
I am merely your guide.
but if I ignore your chosen path, then-- I'll never find my mother, will I?
she's a poor little thing.
mending Camilla Pazzi's heart will be the least of our concerns if my brother sabotages this feast.
the snub could propel us all into still more years of blood feud.
look at Francesco. Look at them all.
the Pazzis glower like that. - Exactly.
today was supposed to be different.
how long should we wait?
always so impatient, Francesco.
talk with them.
complain of the scandal of Giuliano's absence.
your anger at the cur's impudence will disguise your desire to kill.
or it may just spur me to strike even faster.
captain, tracking the comings and goings of Florentines is your specialty.
where is my brother?
I cannot say.
a week ago, my Officer Bertino asked permission to accompany Giuliano to Siena.
I've seen neither of them since.
why Siena?
Giuliano, apparently longed for one last fling before his nuptials.
the pious Bertino promised to keep him from too much trouble.
what if Bertino failed?
what if Giuliano was waylaid on the road?
surely that's the only reason he'd insult us with his absence today.
take a few men and search the roads between Florence and Siena.
all of us yearn to know what has become of Giuliano, Captain.
settle the matter for us. Please.
there is a ship bound for Cape Verde, the Basilisk.
under the command of Antonio de Noli.
as we speak, de Noli is in Florence, loading a barge with provisions for a journey.
at dawn, he takes the barge to Pisa, where the Basilisk is anchored.
you, Leonardo, must book passage on that ship.
with your navigational skills, the Basilisk will survive the storms and reach another land entirely, where the Book of Leaves awaits.
some years ago, a magician promised me he would hide something for you.
a magician?
cosimo de Medici?
cached within Cosimo's tomb is a mariner's astrolabe.
with it, you will navigate the Basilisk safely to the lands indicated on the map.
cosimo hid it in a way that only you would solve his riddle.
as ever, you know the right games to tantalize me.
you must carry the astrolabe onto that barge.
the Book of Leaves, of your mother's fate, will remain a mystery.
isn't this the moment where you spin a coin, put me into a trance?
no coins.
no trances.
you either book passage West or you don't.
you succeed or you fail.
the choice and the consequences are yours.
be still, child. - I'm going to be sick.
you're already sick. No one calls for me if they're well.
here. Hold this.
you've not stepped over a grave, have you?
or drunk milk that's gone to spoil?
no, Ottavia. Nothing like that.
here. Piss into this.
I saw a butcher's daughter last week, blubbering on about a malady akin to this.
had to split her open. Worms.
Oh. Cloudy as a winter's dawn.
is that bad?
a pinch or two of this every two days, and be sure to stay out of the light of the moon.
not for your sake but for his.
for who?
your son. You're not with worms, girl.
you're with child.
bring me to him.
I've sent Clarice away to spare her whatever tragedy you may have brought here.
delay no more. Show me.
my Officer Bertino. Found on the road to Siena.
hacked to death. Bandits?
most likely. Yet we found no trace of Giuliano.
take more men. Find him, alive or dead.
I must know my brother's fate.
where am I?
in the Val d'Elsa, Signor.
we found you in the river, more dead than alive.
I nursed your wounds.
I thank you for that.
soon as I seen your clothes, I knew you was a nobleman.
and yet, you didn't rob me.
wouldn't be Christian.
what day is it? How long have I been out?
holy Saturday, Signor.
when they laid Christ's body in the tomb.
I have to get back to Florence.
I need to warn Lorenzo.
you need to rest, son.
I can't.
no time.
the dead still walk.
I assumed you had to be dead.
some said you traveled to Wallachia, others to Rome.
which was it? - Both.
both.
so why are we meeting here?
what intrigue are you involving me in this time?
this tomb, you designed it for Cosimo?
to an extent.
like Cosimo's portrait, is it possible this tomb contains secret mysteries?
this mosaic, see how the circles weave through the design.
step back and focus only on that.
king Solomon's Knot.
the ancient symbol representing the wisdom of eternity.
Yes.
other men live among the trappings of this world.
but Cosimo's face was always turned beyond worldly distractions to the universe above.
he had the most agile mind I've ever known... until I met you.
you honor me.
you're the closest thing I've ever known to a father.
I'm about to leave you again.
this time, on a quest from which I may never return.
every question you answer leads to another question.
and such quests lead many to nothing but misery.
the true misery is if all the questions are solved, cos then there's nothing left to ask.
where do you voyage now? - It depends on what I find here.
I designed no secret compartment.
but-- but the Magician could install one without anyone knowing.
like a flaw.
cosimo would never have permitted it.
and yet... Look. Look! Do you see?
it's exactly the same as the semi-circles in King Solomon's Knot.
and Cosimo's gaze reflected on Libra, the scales of balance.
perhaps there's a matching discrepancy?
here. Do you see? There. Look.
do they form an axis?
well, if so, then there must be another axis that crosses it.
exactly.
starting here.
then its mate would be... Here. Look.
the center of the knot would be-- directly above the heart.
the question answered.
which leads to another question.
Yes.
magnificently so.
Signor!
Signor Medici, where have you been?
what's befallen you?
treachery. A moment alone, Captain?
Bertino and I determined Lucrezia Donati to be a spy.
you cannot mean it.
we sought her out in Siena, and came across her being attacked by bandits.
we dispatched them but at the cost of Bertino's life.
Lucrezia stabbed me.
left me for dead.
she is an agent of and Riario and Pope Sixtus.
Capaldi! Ride with Black Martin. Tell Lorenzo Giuliano lives.
I will escort him home at a pace his wounds allow. Go. Go!
thank you, Captain, for your consideration.
it is nothing.
someone needs to tend to you.
we had a contract.
you break it and I will be justified in depriving you of your freedom.
and what happened to the last man who tried to pen me up in Florence?
you'll find me more of a match to you than that hapless magistrate.
I would.
what about a small duchy of your own?
that would give you the freedom to amass all the knowledge you like.
and you have duchies sitting around to hand out like party favors?
the Duke of Urbino and I made an alliance to move on the Papacy.
that will give us the ability to give you the legitimacy you have never had.
I suspect your alliance is dead.
at the Vatican I saw the Duke of Urbino himself.
one can't miss the man. He looked quite at home.
so as you desert me, you bring me word that my only other source of military defense is a sham?
you approached him because you knew he had a price, yes?
someone outbid you.
fuck you.
artists approach me all the time.
they are full of vague and glorious ideas on which they rarely deliver.
case in point.
you were warned.
you were warned in this very room.
I accept many commissions, I finish few.
I gave you the chance to be the foremost artist of your day.
I gave you the most desirable woman in Florence as a subject.
she was never my subject.
you and I love this city, do we not?
we do.
then help me save it.
what else can I give you?
what about her?
her husband's clearly not an obstacle.
you think I would just toss her to you just like that?
you have a wife.
who has her charms. Who needs attention.
how much does Lucrezia mean to you, Lorenzo?
are you willing to set aside your toy to keep me in Florence?
Magnifico, your brother has been found.
Giuliano is alive.
wounded but alive.
who wounded him?
Lucrezia Donati.
and she is also alive? - It appears so.
what was she doing attacking Giuliano?
did she know of your plans?
Giuliano is unarmed and in the care of Dragonetti.
he won't live to see Florence again.
but if people learn Giuliano has been killed,
Lorenzo will rally the people behind him.
we must strike at Lorenzo first.
Easter Mass.
dawn tomorrow we will poison Lorenzo in the very act of taking holy communion, and damn Cardinal Orsini's pious hesitations.
it will look as if God himself has taken down the tyrant.
what is your name? - Capaldi.
find Father Bagnone and Father Maffei.
have them prepare the Host for Lorenzo, and his wife, and all his daughters.
then ride back to Dragonetti and make sure that Giuliano has met his death.
consider it done, my lord.
within hours... we will own Florence.
but why would Lucrezia agree to act as Rome's catspaw?
Sixtus only rewards his own blood.
did you know he's already rewarded six of his nephews as cardinals?
he is loyal. - To the point of incestuousness.
the virtue of a republic like Florence is that offices go to the most worthy, appointments are made only on merit.
I dare say you earned your rank on the basis of achievement, Dragonetti?
I did.
and you demonstrate that repeatedly.
the details in your curfew ledgers without them,
Bertino and I could never have uncovered the name of Lorenzo's betrayer.
all one needed was the time to study the records.
and you had the time, of course.
I do take my work seriously.
that's how she was able to avoid detection after curfew, isn't it?
she had the perfect alibi, fucking my brother, and because the first man to raise questions about her activities was already in league with Rome himself.
I could try and ride away.
but you're unwounded, your mount is fresher.
finish what your spy began, then.
perhaps she'll reward you between her legs.
that is not what spurs me. - What does?
a desire for a Florence that fears God, not its masters.
let's get to your brother's side.
de Noli's barge, bound for Pisa?
aye, Signor.
how much to book passage for three?
we take only freight and baggage.
I told you, only freight and baggage.
I have to board the Basilisk.
Yeah, you're beginning to look like baggage.
dawn tomorrow. Don't be late.
each of my brigades awaits near one of these gates.
you may consider Florence already under our control.
your men are loyal to you? - But of course.
because if they get battle-hungry and invade prematurely, the Florentines will rise against them.
the Florentines are shopkeepers and clerks.
we're soldiers.
the Florentines live in narrow corridors and alleyways where they can strike unexpectedly.
if they rise to fight for their home, it will not resemble the fields of battle you know.
we have new weapons for street warfare.
you will follow our lead.
the Pazzis' role in all this is to overthrow the tyrants, establish a clear new regime.
while your role is only to appear if summoned to cement the powers-that-will-be into place.
if I choose to move on Florence myself... who are you to stop me?
tell me, who is it that pays your men?
you sit in the middle, conveying their wages which issue from the vaults of Rome.
act against me, and that same city shall brand you a heretic, strip you of your titles, and excommunicate you.
resist further, and His Holiness will have that metal eyepiece of yours melted down and poured over your testicles in the middle of the Piazza Navona.
I've seen what he's capable of with... both of my eyes.
your man returns.
perhaps with news from my brother.
he comes not from Il Magnifico but from Count Riario to confirm I've killed you.
why is he not riding away with news I'm still alive?
I think he has another plan.
hold.
what are you doing? - What's best for Florence.
pick up his sword.
you'll need a weapon if you're going to save your brother.
do it now, Giuliano. Before I change my mind again.
it's me.
you think I don't know your footsteps?
give me a reason... Why I shouldn't puncture your neck this instant.
not today.
you poisoned Vanessa and I risked dementia trying to save her.
you shared the secrets of my war machinery with Riario and put the city at peril.
this... this denunciation that names me a sexual criminal, had me thrown in jail to face the bonfire.
this is your work!
I had Nico send you to the convent to keep your friend alive.
I begged for your mercy during the trial and made enemies who seek my life.
you will never understand the risks I have taken...
to keep your father alive. - What?
I know. I know.
he wishes me to tell you how much he loves you.
I spoke with him in his cell in Castel Sant'angelo.
then you grasp the hold they have maintained over me.
it's a hold so strong... that you would even poison an innocent man.
and what of the risks you have faced in search of your mother?
if it fell to you to keep her alive, would you say "No, I'll preserve another's life"?
I would find another way.
Yeah, how easy it is for you to believe that.
I would understand your actions, Lucrezia... if your father hadn't rejected my offer to set him free.
you're lying. - No.
you've committed these sins for nothing.
your work argues that man is capable of anything.
well, between us, we prove it.
you show us the heights that we can reach and I show us the depths.
of late... I've met men who dwell in shadows, speaking of other times and other lives.
maybe... if they're correct... a life exists in which we...
Yes. Yes. Yes.
no, I can't do this. I can't.
please. Please. - I can't. I can't.
I have to go. I have to...
a ship waits in Pisa to take me to the Book Of Leaves. If I'm not on the Basilisk...
Riario and the Pazzis are moving on Florence.
they want to kill Lorenzo. - I could care less, what they do.
let the politicians kill each other, that's their forte.
Leonardo, please, you are only one who can stop this.
if you're not going to do it for me or for Lorenzo, then do it for Florence.
for Florence?
for Florence? The city that turned its back on me?
the bastard son?
the sodomite?
a younger Da Vinci might've bought your arguments, Lucrezia.
but... I've endured too much these last few months to be swayed by sentiment.
it's Easter.
if Florence demands a sacrifice... I suggest you offer yourself.
you still endeavor to taint the air with that foul stench, I see.
a vice.
one that Girolamo sees fit to allow me.
not the only one.
I've never understood your obsession with this game.
I imagine you've played thousands of times, and what has it brought you?
know thy self, know thine enemy.
it is but a recreation.
true strategic mastery must be forged in the arena of life.
happy Easter. - Indeed.
for today brings not only the resurrection of Christ... but the resurrection of Florence under Rome's rule.
soon, all the Italian states will fall into line.
I will then turn my attention to the true enemy of God... the Ottoman Empire.
a final Holy War.
a glorious victory for which I will be made... a saint.
beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then there will be no reward from your Father... who is in heaven.
I must thank you.
for without you, I could never have achieved today's triumph.
and for this, perhaps you would offer me... something in return?
I believe it's time you and I... played another game.
don't you agree... brother?
is all in place?
fathers Bagnone and Maffei are preparing the poison.
and the Cardinal?
he's too fucking pious to be told of this change of plans.
while he prays, the priests will deliver the tainted Eucharist to Lorenzo.
Quattrone. Medici loyalist.
if he goes against us, he'll join Lorenzo in the afterlife.
is there any news of Da Vinci?
the last I heard, he was in Rome.
he's countered us again and again!
can we act if we don't know the man's whereabouts?
calm yourself, Francesco.
we have long prepared. All is ready.
signorina, you make an old man... believe in the perfectibility of mankind.
thank you, Maestro.
what troubles you, Vanessa?
have you seen Giuliano de Medici?
I must speak to him. He needs to hear this.
quickly, before the Cardinal sees.
ensure that these wafers go to the Medicis, and only the Medicis.
and then we can truly celebrate this mass.
happy Easter, Lorenzo.
and to you, Francesco.
where is Giuliano?
I'm sure Dragonetti will bring him straight here.
I'm sure of nothing today.
God's trousers, Leo. Where the fuck have you been all night?
only haunted by a final farewell.
the barge is loaded and the captain's keen to depart.
impatient canker blossom threatened to double the fee if he waited any longer.
well... then let's save some coin and be on our way.
what's this?
this is us asking the Fates where the fuck you've been.
the Chariot. Reversed?
uncontrolled passion, leading to defeat.
time to leave, I'd say. Come on.
it's so quiet.
the bells have stopped.
mass has begun.
fuck.
there's something I must do.
there's no time. - The barge won't wait. Make a decision.
the Book Of Leaves or whoever tears you away. You can't have both.
I can. I can, if you just find a way to keep them here until I return.
I'm not gonna be long. Just stall them, Zo.
please!
there's another meaning to that card.
a journey thwarted.
in nominee Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.
Amen. - Amen.
do you fear God, Signora?
the wise... both fear and love God.
why then do you hesitate to enter His house?
because it isn't God who waits for me inside those doors.
riders approach.

hell is descending upon this city.
get yourself to safety. Now.
what has happened to you?
God will permit no violence.
you cannot disrupt a sacred mass!
sheathe your weapon! - I'm sorry, but I cannot.
cease your intrusion. This is a House of God.
and God loves truth. Let him speak.
the Pazzis conspire against us - my family!
they're in league with Rome and betray all Florence!

your cause betrays Florence.

Rome is my family.

Oh, Giuliano! Oh, no! No!
No!

Clarice... please!

I'm... I'm dying, Vanessa.

No! No! - Yes. Come on.

I suggest you take them away and leave this one to me.
but Signora Donati... has betrayed you for Rome.
leave them to each other, Signora.

I've prayed for this day. Today, Florence rejoices.
are you certain of that, Pazzi?
before you die, Lorenzo, know that I'll kill every last Medici in Florence.
I'll wipe all evidence of your family's existence from this world!
iron rusts from disuse.
let us finish off the Medicis, scribbler, and we might let you live.
a Florence ruled by Pazzis? No!
no. I think I'd rather go down fighting.
as you wish.
come on. Come on!
come on! Come on!
that won't hold long. - The doors will hold.
Verrocchio designed the locks.
Giuliano? Have I lost a brother?
da Vinci!
upon my arrival I saw only you.
I knew you wouldn't abandon us. - Stop. Save your strength.
da Vinci!
it'll be over soon, Lucrezia!
I'm sorry, Leonardo. You've saved my life, and I know what it's cost you...
SSH. Save your praise for someone who deserves it.
I wonder which of the two men you fuck will be buried alongside you?
you chose Florence over your own dreams.
you will accept my love.
it is the least I can offer you.
this ring. I know this ring.
it's Lucrezia's.
are you fucking her... or is it more?
you better finish the job they have begun or I swear...
if we survive this, I'll kill you both.
God's vengeance is upon you!
flowers can deliver love, but can also deliver death.
I started planting the flowers she painted, hoping that they would help remove the smell of gunpowder on me.
but the smell deep inside my soul doesn't disappear.
the Magnum 357 revolver doesn't leave shells.
hollow-point bullets also leave no shells.
for an assassin, leaving traces means death.
welcome.
I'm so sorry that this is still necessary.
following the rules keeps you alive.
look at you like a lump of rock heavy, hard, and unchanging.
do you know me that well?
of course I do.
I heard you are up for something new lately.
I grow flowers.
grow Flowers?
I thought there is a girl
for a killer, women are more dangerous than guns.
y you have to be careful
don't worry.
look at this antique gun.
lf you don't handle it right it'll kill you before killing your enemy
a woman is just as dangerous you got to be careful
flower
who could it be?
the one who sends me flowers everyday at 4: 15
I looked up the meaning of daisy
hidden love!
OK. One more time
my grandfather thinks
I am like an antique.
because I'm 24
and have never had a date.
but I have someone I'm waiting for.
you should smile more naturally.
here we go.
are you sure it's a good picture?
of course, now look this way.
OK, here's your key.
thank you.
good, all the best.
I remember the first day I saw her.
april 15th.
it was the day after I killed a man for the first time.
after that, I began delivering daisies to her every day.
because of her, I learned about van Gogh, Monet, and Rembrandt.
okay Five o'clock coffee time! you want some coffee?
Yes, please!
lf I pretend I'm her.
I feel like my soul is pure, at least a little bit.
why does he send flowers but never show himself?
how much?
okay
can you pay first?
sorry, but I have to go. Okay?
Oh, but I'm not done yet.
Ah! you're Korean?
Yes.
will you be here tomorrow?
I'll come tomorrow at the same time.
you can continue then, okay?
okay. you want some candy?
okay.
I am so sorry.
I spilled coffee on your portrait.
I should start again.
Oh. Okay.
go ahead.
Hello?
what?
you should look at me for the portrait.
okay. Sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I have to go now.
actually, I'm done.
that was quick.
I could have done it quicker.
I see.
lf you don't like it, I can do another.
how about I come again next week?
can you paint one like that?
see you later.
wait a minute, there's something on your face.
who is that guy?
the one making her smile?
down comes the rain and he's not coming.
it wasn't rain that I was waiting for.
Jeong Woo?
lnterpol!
how have you been?
Oh, this.
it's just a sprain.
it will be fine in a few days.
what happened?
it rained so hard yesterday, and I slipped.
did you wait long yesterday?
huh? no. I didn't.
only a little.
good. I didn't want you to have to wait in the rain.
I see.
shall we begin?
shall we begin what?
the oil painting.
didn't you say you wanted one?
Oh, yes. Right.
do you want to have that painted as well?
as you like.
do you like this pose?
how about this?
I like spending time with him.
how's it going?
wow, it looks better than I do.
the stubble is a little.
flowers!
here.
can I come in?
ls this for sale, too?
Yes. But it's a fake.
except the picture.
I like it.
how did you know I was here?
I know everything.
I want this.
how much is it?
just take it. lt's a gift.
that's no way to do business.
no, really. Just take it.
well, then.
why not take this in exchange?
I thought you might have a hard time finding good kimchi.
here.
wow, this looks delicious!
l've made it myself.
lt tastes good.
did you paint all these yourself?
Yes.
must have used lots of paint.
here's your coffee.
here. Oh, yes.
I thought you spilled coffee on this.
that's not you.
I'm sure you said you spilled coffee on that.
funny. I could have sworn that was me.
wow, what's that place?
that spring, I went there to paint the daisies for an exhibition.
for me, daisies are like little sunflowers.
van Gogh painted sunflowers.
I paint daisies.
van Gogh was the one who made me want to be a painter.
after the fall, I was too scared to cross the wooden bridge.
so I took a detour.
but later, I found a new bridge.
at first, I thought it was a coincidence.
but then I felt that someone built this bridge just for me.
the next day, somebody took my painting.
I think it was the person who built the bridge for me.
because after that, somebody began sending me daisies.
flowers!
I am looking outside the window, hoping to see the deliveryman.
but there is no one there.
so I painted him as a shadow.
l've been waiting for him.
and. I think l've found him.
I couldn't tell her I was not the one.
lnstead of lying.
or telling her the truth.
I chose silence.
our duty is.
to track down drug traffickers operating between Asia and Amsterdam.
hello Sir, Do you want to pay?
do you want to have flowers?
thank you, have a nice day.
from here.
I can see everything in their hideout, the pharmacy...
and not worry about being seen since she blocks me.
Oh, I'm not done yet.
the second time I sat by her.
I felt she has some feelings for me.
fortunately, it was just a petty thief.
I'm lucky my cover wasn't blown.
by now they must know I'm here.
I know I'm putting her in danger by being close to her.
but I couldn't help myself.
how's it going?
here's a present.
I wish I am the man she is been waiting for.
lt's been a week.
a week without flowers.
maybe he's afraid of me.
now that you can see me, no flowers seem necessary.
I can draw you by memory now.
how much do you know about me, Hye-young?
you're a Korean businessman working in the netherlands.
your name is Jeong Woo, and you're about 30 something years old.
Oh, and you make very good kimchi.
what if.
I didn't make that kimchi?
would you still care for me?
what do you mean?
Hey! Are you okay?
take care of her please.
Hello! Are you all right?
are you.Oh.
Hey! Hey!
Casualty! Casualty! We need an ambulance! Ambulance! Casualty!
I lost my voice from the stray bullet and the shock.
they told me Jeong Woo was injured and sent back to Korea.
but I can't believe it.
and when these wither, Fresh ones will arrive. Right?
so, how are you doing today?
okay.
smart, so you don't have to write them out each time.
so, no more sign language lessons then?
take care.
to welcome me back to work, my grandpa takes pictures.
there's a man standing across the street in the picture.
Jeong Woo.
why wouldn't he come and see me?
hello.
Yes, I'm Korean.
you must be Korean, too?
30 Euro per Sketch
Oh, okay.
make a good portrait please.
she looked so heartbroken.
so I couldn't stay behind anymore.
are you okay?
I am sorry. I will paint another one.
lt's ok.
maybe it's better if I come again later.
no, no.
draw me next time.
let me take you home.
lt's okay.
give it to me.
get in.
lt's ok.
I'm with her now.
I'm taking her home.
I am taking her home.
I live nearby.
Hello, I just stopped by on my way home.
give it to me.
let's go together.
since I can't speak.
he plays music for me.
but I am still waiting for Jeong Woo.
I have no place for him in my heart.
yeo-Ok. Wait. for me.?
black tulips.
remind me of who I am.
killer's girl could be a bait and target.
would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
sure, I know a great restaurant.
I'm sorry, would you mind waiting a little while?
l've got something to do.
I'll be back soon.
please don't go, stay here.
I'm used to waiting.
my grandpa said my parents would come, but they didn't.
and because of you, Jeong Woo,
I'm used to waiting.
sorry, the power has just gone out.
lt will be back in 5 minutes.
everybody please don't worry. We'll bring you some candles.
sorry I kept you waiting so long.
thank you for being so nice.
I'm sorry, but I am in love with someone else already.
I like your paintings.
and I just want us to be friends.
he built a bridge for me and sent me daisies every day.
Jeong Woo.
I think he blames himself for what happened to me.
but he doesn't understand that losing him.
is so much more painful than losing my voice.
I didn't do anything for him.
I never even thanked him.
april 15.
he promised to come to my exhibition.
I'm waiting for him.
lt's no use in just waiting.
why haven't we heard anything from him?
he's not seriously injured.
but I'm afraid he's not allowed to leave the country anymore.
could you give us his address?
I am really sorry but I can't.
lf you have a message for him, you can give it to me.
wait a minute.
this is a storage room.
Oh, this.
this is from a friend.
do you like classical music?
have something to drink.
about lmpressionism yes.
here's Monet.
I like Monet.
Monet's paintings are dreamlike.
they make you imagine things.
yes?
can I use these daisies for the exhibition?
of course!
let's go to the headquarters.
I want to see Hye-young first.
you're still out of your mind.
do you know how hard I worked to get you back here?
and how many times did I tell you that it wasn't your fault she got hurt?
you were injured in the line of duty.
don't feel guilty.
I'm going to tell her the truth.
everything.
damn, you're driving me crazy.
that's all well and good.
but it's too late.
there is a new guy with her now.
Hello, this is Hye-young Kim.
please leave a message, and I'll call you back.
please leave a message and I'll call you back. thank you.
Jeong Woo.
why doesn't he say anything?
I can't speak, but I can hear if he talks.
ls it too late for me to come?
I saw this somewhere, and I bought it for you.
how about a cup of coffee?
I'm sorry that it's been so long since I last saw you.
I was too busy at work and got stuck in Korea.
how have you been?
Yes. yes I'm fine.
I was in this area and.
Why?
I'm sorry that.
I never told you the truth.
I am.
I'm a cop.
I used you during an investigation.
and got you injured.
I felt so guilty that.
I didn't have the courage to see you.
but I think it's time for me.
to apologize to you formally.
I am truly sorry.
she lost her voice.
and I lost her.
l've found some clues about the guy who shot you.
but I thought all we know is that he is Asian.
there were no fingerprints in the apartment.
the bullets - 5. 56 subsonic with a silencer.
so that's why we didn't hear the sound of gunfire.
that's right! He's a professional killer.
he's probably behind the killings at the hotel and the theater.
over the last few weeks.
he probably belongs to a group of professional killers for hire l've asked some guys to look into how these killers are contracted.
And?
what do you mean 'and'?
we can hire him.
we'll wait for him and catch him.
where do we get the money?
the boss won't approve it.
I'm not proud of this, but.
I won some money at the slots recently.
I'll never get promoted if I don't catch this guy.
detective Jang!
are you out of your mind?
so for this plan to work, you need to hire the assassin?
what if he succeeds?
lt might be okay if you put a contract on yourself?
you must be kidding.
I have a family to look after then you can hire him to kill me
that'll solve everything.
what the.
want some coffee?
Hye-young this is for me.
I told a friend l'd come here.
please get in.
he's a cop.
lt's not an easy assignment, but the client specifically asked for you.
we're in a business where.
we must never say 'no' to a client.
don't worry.
I will always be there to back you up.
I heard you've been seeing someone lately.
you need money for the girl just like I need you for the job.
suspect approaching, suspect approaching!
lt's okay. He's a friend.
what?
hello.
hello.
what a place to meet you.
Yes.
may I talk to you?
sure, hop in.
why don't you have lunch?
I'll be back right away.
Hey! Where you going?
Jeong Woo!!!
I just need a few minutes.
no, it's dangerous to stay there.
Hye-young told me a lot about you.
Really?
I feel so bad about Hye-young.
I can be quite careless sometimes.
I didn't really mean it.
I knew you were sincere.
the music is too loud.
can we listen to something else?
sure
how did he know it was me from behind the car lf you're the assassin.
what will happen to Hye-young?
you could have just shot me.
I wonder how you recognized me.
am I not your target?
do you think I won't shoot you?
I don't know if you'll shoot me or not.
but I know I can.
try it.
I don't have to try.
neither do l.
did you forget who you are?
you're the good guy.
I'm the bad guy.
you are not here to kill me. Why?
for Hye-young.
not for yourself?
I should've stayed out of her sight in the first place.
you're the daisy guy.?
she doesn't know it yet.
do you know how long she's waited for you?
only before you came along.
you should be going to the exhibition today.
how about you?
unless you arrest me.
I'll disappear.
Hye-young!
what's going on?
Jeong Woo.
has been killed.
in the line of duty.
I feel sorry about it, but I draw whenever I think ofJeong Woo.
lt makes me less lonely.
she sketches me.
probably only because she feels sorry.
but, still, there I am within her reach.
this part, this part is really interesting.
l've seen it a hundred times, but it's still sad every time.
I can read what you're saying.
say something
just try.
try it!
can you really read my lips?
ls that what you said?
he's not lonely at all.
he must be glad that you are here.
lt's been a year but I still don't know what has happened.
before he was murdered, he told me he met a friend.
and they left together
my only clue was his car stereo. it was playing classical music.
Jeong Woo never listened to that kind of stuff.
that means his friend changed it. And he's missing.
we've also learned that the killers received black tulips when they are contracted.
do you like classical music?
lt's been a year. How have you been?
I'm fine.
your position has been compromised.
that interpol dective, Jang, is on to you.
didn't I tell you falling for a woman is like pointing a gun at yourself?
forget about the mistake you made a year ago.
this is your last chance.
your girlfriend suspects you.
this is a storage room
dinner is almost ready.
have some tea.
drink before it gets cold.
it'll warm you up.
I'm sorry, get some sleep for now your grandpa will be late.
he wants us to eat together.
do you like beef?
I hope so.
you'll find out tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
nine minutes, all unit standby.
report your status.
okay, got that take cover for Zone A then.
I'm sorry.
at first.
I just wanted to help this lovely young woman.
I built a bridge, then you gave me a painting.
and I started sending daisies
but the bridge I built became a bridge between you and him.
later, I could see you so sad after he'd left.
that's why. I showed up.
now I'll give your heart back.
alpha set
beta set
Charlie, do you copy?
Charlie set.
what are you doing here?
lt's dangerous here.
get out of the way. Hurry
who is the girl?
okay. I know her. Don't worry. I got it.
stop it.
stop it.
do you see this painting?
you made me so happy.
this painting, I gave it to you.
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.
now I know that you're the one l've been waiting for.
Hye-young
I'm right here.
I'm sorry
I couldn't.
I don't deserve you
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Jeong Woo.
I'm sorry I let Jeong Woo die.
all I wanted was to make you happy
I'm sorry.
the love l've been dreaming of.
is all so close to me.
but all I can do is.
just watching you without words.
ln this city of strangers.
I lived day by day painting love.
waiting and hoping that you'll be here with the scent of daisies.
lt is too late but now.
I finally recognize you.
but maybe we were not meant to be.
I never wanted to let this love fly away.
but I am sorry
I have to leave.
with you still breathing here.
no, not yet. I'm sorry. no, no.
Hello, this is Kim Hye-young.
I can't come to the phone right now. Please leave a message.
please leave a message and I'll call you back. thank you!
Hello, this is Kim Hye-young.
I can't come to the phone right now. Please leave a message.

Hewes & associates called me yesterday.
once Patty meets you, there's no turning back
she'll see what I see, and she'll own you
ms. Hewes. What are you doing here?
kiddo, you're the first person stupid enough to turn me down.
is there any way I could still interview?
you're hired.
we are engaging in a battle with a man who will stop at nothing to preserve his fortune.
Arthur Frobisher told his employees to invest in the company and then sold his own stock
she's on a mission here, and she won't stop until you're strung up in the public square
make the call. I want some leverage
my boss wanted me to check up on his investments
you're my sister. How do you know Arthur Frobisher?
I catered a function for him and some businessmen
Katie, this whole case turns on one weekend, and you were there
you want me to be a witness against Frobisher?
the new associate has been talking to Katie Connor
whatever it takes. fix this
I think we have a strong case
I'd like to take it to a jury and let them decide what mrArthur Frobisher owes you
I say we end this here and now
I vote to accept the settlement
how could you have possibly made such a catasrophic screwup
you're fired. Get out of the car!
my future sister-in-law is a potential witness in the biggest case in Patty's career
you think Patty hired you just to get to Katie?
did she only hire me to deliver her witness?
there's no way she knew about your friend.
call Patty
you know what this means?
if Katie can help the case, then we're doing the right thing
if Frobisher thought this would shut her up, it's done the opposite
what's this?
a souvenir for Patty
maybe one of these days, I'll stop being impressed
Ellen figures out why you hired her and you still get her to deliver the witness
I like Ellen
I think she's going to have a brilliant future
Ortiz! You better get in here
Hey, boss, it's williams. We got a body
and a murder weapon
all right, nobody sing because we all know - Ellen hates singing! - Whatever, whatever 6 Months Earlier - But I love fudgie the whale - make a wish
this next one is from your favorite aunt and uncle
didn't anybody read the invitation?
Yeah, yeah, you and your "no gift" bullshit
does anybody want anything?
Ellen - I'm okay
David, we know you two are real busy
a young lawyer with a fantastic new job and a dreamy doctor fianc?
Oh, the dreamiest
you both work so much, you don't even have time to eat, plus you're saving your money to move into manhattan
you got us an apartment?
so until Katie's restaurant opens
Aw, dinner for two at the olive garden！
when you're there, you're family
thank you. Thank you.
Frobisher's lawyer calls three times a day
he's just trying to intimidate you
they just want you to sign the confidentiality agreement
I hate these people
when you see Patty tomorrow, she'll tell you how to handle them
every time I close my eyes, I see Saffron dead on my kitchen floor
Patty thinks Frobisher's an asshole, too
the guy bankrupted 5, 000 of his employees
I don't even care if I never step foot in my restaurant again
Katie, we'll get through this. Okay?
the worst is over - El, your mom wants you to open up her present. - Okay - You guys okay? - Wait
while I got you both here
happy birthday, Ellen
it's a little kitsch to add to your collection for your new apartment
Thanks, honey, you're sweet - Do you like it - Beautiful
want to see a lightning-rich black opal that'll knock your eyeballs out of their sockets?
look at this
lightning-rich black, solid platinum
top gem, world-class
look at this, look at this, look at the colors in this thing
Oh, my gosh, unreal
okay, Patty, I get it, I get it.
I don't need to know what I don't need to know
your advance for the next two weeks
so consider me on call
I'll just wait around to hear from you
good luck with the Frobisher clients - Has Ellen tried to contact you again? - No
I like that she trusts you
run into her again
talk to her
where?
the office
I thought you want everyone to think I was fired
all the more reason to stop by
clear out your stuff, work the relationship.
page six. This morning's paper
I went shopping yesterday, Arthur
it's in there today
no, thanks
they're saying I spent $20, 000 on shoes while your former employees are lined up for food stamps
Yeah, well, you know, you can't pay attention to this crap, Holly.
I spent $2, 000 and it was for the kids
all right, all right, I'll have Ray Fiske make a call, see if we can get them to print a retraction
then some shithead photographer chased us and hit my car, but I can't go to the police because that would just bring more press
Bethie's friends won't come over
their parents won't let them. Reporters are following her to school
I know, I know, she told me
this is not a childhood, Arthur
you promised me that all of this would be over after the government trial
look, there are things that are beyond my control. You know that
I am trying to settle this case
try harder
I offered them $100 million for something i didn't do.
I offer them more - Give them whatever they want - Okay
how much? One billion? Two billion?
I'll tell you what
why don't I give you the pen and you write the check?
you promised me, Arthur
don't look at me like that, thank you, Ricky, it looks fantastic
I'll tell you what. Why don't you eat it, though, all right?
no, actually, come here, come here, come here
you know what?
just pick the peppers out of this thing and give it to the dogs
they'll love it
we have the MET GALA on sunday and I don't want to be late, so be sure you're home from golf
I'm doing everything I can to make this go away
tuesday night is the helping hands auction
I'm fine to go to that alone
Holly, come on, don't do that
and we have to make a decision about the Aspen house
are we going to keep building or are we going to sell it?
Holly, please
what, Arthur? I heard you
you're doing all that you can
what do you want me to say?
nothing
these are for ms.Hewes' meeting with Kathryn Connor - Well, good morning - Morning
your ears must have been ringing last night
why is that?
I was talking about you
really
aren't you going to ask what I was saying?
well, I figured you'd tell me if you wanted me to know
all good things, Ellen, all good things
thank you
there's a client meeting in ten minutes
come sit in
another week? What the hell are we talkingabout?
Frobisher offered us $100 million to settle and we voted to accept it
nothing has been signed yet, mr.Popular
but it was a done deal
Larry, ms. Hewes thinks this witness can prove Frobisher's guilt
I don't want to lose that money
Frobisher is praying that you settle. The money's going nowhere
so what would you like from us?
time, Karen
this new witness was in Florida the same weekend as Arthur Frobisher
if you give us another week, we can find out what this witness knows, and I believe it will give us leverage
ms. Hewes, you really think this could be the smoking gun?
I'd like the opportunity to find out
sorry to be a stickler for the rules, Art, but Uncle Sam has designated this environment smoke-free
I called you because our young friend Katie Connor hasn't been to the restaurant in a week nor has she signed the new paperwork, which could spell disaster
okay, Art, what do you want to talk about?
what happens if she leaves me?
I beg your pardon?
bottom line it for me, will you?
well, this is new york state, Art
you'll write her a check for half of everything
and the kids?
she's the sympathetic mother who runs three children's charities
which I founded
and you're a controversial father involved in a very public litigation to defend your reputation
you need her, Art, now more than ever
she's the one person who's remained loyal to you
if she leaves now, we'll take a beating in the press
all right, all right, let me ask and if we lose this, this Katie Connor, what happens?
if she doesn't sign the paperwork, it becomes a hell of a lot harder to destroy her credibility
look, Art， the law is on our side
the evidence is on our side
on paper, this case is tighter than a bull's ass on fight night
but if Patty Hewes gets that girl in front of a jury all bets are off
Hey. I'm here to see Patty Hewes
welcome to hewes & associates
how you feeling?
nervous
come on back. Patty's running a few minutes late
I'll show you my office - This place is incredible. - I know
so, how many people are going to be in there?
just you, me and Patty
we'll go through your florida timeline and make sure you're hitting all the details about that weekend
I saw him two or three times that weekend
that's fine
Patty just wants to see if anything you can remember will contradict Frobisher's testimony
so, I can read it off my notes?
of course. It's not a test
I'm in here - Another thing? - Yeah?
you look great. - Thanks
I totally forgot to call you to ask you what to wear
Ellen, Felicia wants to see the two of us - Okay - Now - Hang in there. I'll be back. - Sure
we've bought ourselves more time
the clients have agreed to give us another week
Patty wants us to start prepping their testimonies, getting them to tell their stories
why go poking at wounds now?
it'll make them want to settle even sooner
Really?
anyone else want to weigh in?
I'm not sure
not sure what?
I grew up with people like this
a $100 million settlement sounds like a gold mine to them, and it's softening their resolve
if you want them to turn it down,
I think you're right to remind them what they've been through, stir up their emotion - I could see the value in that. - Good
divide them up. Each of you take a department
Ellen, shadow andrew. See how we do it
now?
the car's waiting downstairs to take you to Newark
is Patty leaving?
no, no, no, she's still meeting with you
but I thought you were going to be there
Patty'll take care of you
Debra, could you look after ms. Connor, please?
you'll be great
I'll call you when we're done
you're a smart girl, Ellen, but you better watch your ass
what?
Tom Shayes is gone
when it came time to recruit, we each backed our own horse
your boy Tom bet on you
he was the only one who stood to gain when you got the job
what are you trying to tell me?
I'm trying to tell you, you should think twice before you shoot your mouth off - Andrew, Patty called on me - Yeah?
you think Craig and Felicia care about that?
you don't show up your fellow associates, Ellen
the only way you're going to make it here is with our support
I was just answering a question
I have no agenda
well, maybe you better get one quick
you're in Patty's good graces now because your friend's a witness, but that can change on a dime
Olio santo from California?
unfiltered from Tuscany?
I mean, it's damn ar impossible to decide
the raging olive oil debate between giada de laurentiis and the barefoot contessa
exactly
last night's food network
so, what is better
virgin or extra virgin, or is it all just marketing bullshit?
it's about acidity
an american or italian?
I love a little family-owned vineyard in greece - I'll write down their website for you - Oh, good
I mean, it's expensive, but nothing like Manhattan, though
Ellen was checking out this apartment on 91st and riverside, and I asked her to get some stuff for a salad
eight bucks for an organic tomato. Can you believe that?
great, Katie. Thanks
thanks for coming by
it was nice to meet you - We're finished? - Why?
something else you want to tell me?
no, no. I-I I just thought that we were going to look over the timeline
Oh, I really don't see the point
although, I did have one question
how old were you?
I'm sorry?
I had just turned six
when what?
when I realized I was a good liar
how old wereou?
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about
your timeline?
I don't buy it
so, right now you're going to do one of two things
turn around and get the hell out of my office, - or tell me the truth - The truth?
ms. Hewes, I'm not lying - Katie, don't, don't
it's me and you now. Ellen isn't here
I don't understand
I want the straight story, and until you tell me, you're worthless to me
I don't give a shit about you
wait. Ms. Hewes, please. I...
what aren't you telling me? - Nothing!
I put everything I know down here
ms. Hewes, they want me to sign a new confidentiality agreement
Yeah, I read it. It's very thorough
well, what should I do?
do whatever you want to. Sign it
these people are going to come after me again!
I thought that you were going to protect me
until you stop lying, you're not my witness, and you're not my problem. Please, MsHewes. Wait
Hewes & associates. Can I help you?
we were told the girl lives here with her fianc?
have you questioned her? - Not yet
the front door was chained, but not locked
at approximately 9: 15 A. M,we force entry, and we find this
the stereo's still there, tv
so is the computer
and most telling of all you come to loot a place, you don't leave something like that behind
so, it wasn't a robbery
watch yourself, lieu
he was a good-looking
so, what do you think?
she caught him screwing around?
I don't know what you're talking about
you got to slow down - She's crazy! - Who?
Patty! She-she kicked me out of her office!
she told me to sign the confidentiality agreement
I don't understand - I don't, either! - Ellen?
she's accusing me of lying, Ellen - About what? - Everything!
you read what I wrote. I'm not lying
of course you're not lying
well, then tell that to your boss
you're the one who made me go in there
look, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
Katie, just calm down. Go back to the apartment
I'll be there as soon as I can. Okay?
Mr. Frobisher, the girl just met with Patty Hewes
ray Fiske wouldn't want me talking with you, but I can't believe our hands are just tied here
you gave her a restaurant, mr. Frobisher
what can we do to keep her quiet?
offer more money
no, you can't do that
the judge finds out, I could get nailed for witness tampering
well, there's always a solution
what kind of solution?
a permanent one, what? Oh, god, no
what, you think that I would
it wouldn't get back to you
Oh, we're-we're talking about a human life here
Sh-She's an innocent girl. She didn't do anything
she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time
sometimes that's enough
you're serious, aren't you? You're actually suggesting
look, Mr.Frobisher, you're insulated, you have resources
this kind of thing is simpler than you think
so, how's that work? You...
know a guy? You make a call?
it's simpler than you think
Yeah, of course it is
you become powerful enough, eventually, every option gets presented to you, doesn't it?
Yes, sir
one day, you're living your life
the next thing you know, some man shows up on your doorstep and offers you the ultimate decision
that's all it is, mr. Frobisher-- just another decision
no No
you go down that road, and then, you know, who are you?
I mean, there's no going back
no, no, no - Think about your family, mr. Frobisher - Don't tell me what
this case is going to end with someone's life being destroyed
why should it be yours?
you get what you needed?
Yup
from the palm beach county P. D
issued the morning of the Frobisher event
Katie's hiding details. She left it off her timeline
a traffic ticket seems pretty insignificant
her supervisor's kitchen report says she was right on time
so, she managed to show up for work ten minutes before she was pulled over for running a red light?
find out more
Fiske is making his move, trying to ruin her credibility
there's something in this girl's past
all right, I'm on it
get me everything you can. Boyfriends, jobs, vices
yeah
I want to know why she was late for the biggest day of her career
you think Ellen knows the truth?
uh, it's too soon to tell
anything else?
Yeah, here's the Ellen information we talked about
are you sure you really want to do this?
make it happen
go long, go long - Katie - I'm just grabbing my shit - Where have you been? - Thinking
why didn't you call me back?
Katie, slow down
tell me exactly what happened
ask her
I tried. She didn't call me back
Ellen, I already told you, she's crazy
she thinks I'm lying - About what? - I don't know
I don't-- I don't know what she'd doing
it doesn't make any sense
I don't think she wants you to know
why not?
because ten minutes before my meeting with her, she sent you away
you think that's a coincidence?
come with me tomorrow
we'll go in there together. We'll both talk to her
I'm not going back the
where are you going?
look, I have been living with you for a week
this has gone on for long enough
Ellen, I've got to get home
I have got a life to live
and I don't know anything about Frobisher anyway
take it easy - Get off - What?
Hello?
do it
Yes, sir
Oh, shit
that was intense
Patty appreciates your involvement
what's the girl's name?
do you have what we need?
yeah
here's everything
the fianc?
he's in there, too
my associates will look into it
thank you
nothing too excessive
Patty's come to me before
trust me
I know how she wants it done
don't hover in the door. I hate that
what happened with Katie?
I spoke to her, msHewes. I don't believe she's lying
Really? Why is that?
because she has no reason to
don't be stupid, Ellen
everyone's hiding something
Really?
so what are you hiding?
I beg your pardon?
you didn't need me to meet with the clients yesterday
you just wanted me out of the office, didn't you?
yes
so you lied to me?
what's your point?
why would you do that?
you already answered your own question
I wanted to meet with Katie alone
so you
I manipulated you, yes
well, I don't like being manipulated
duly noted - Anything else? - Yeah
you promised to protect Katie
now she's totally confused. She has no idea what to do
I have a temper, too, Ellen, but I've learned when to use it
you were right
she's using me
of course she's using you, Ellen
Patty Hewes needs people who are driven
she's tapping your energy and youth to further her own agenda
which is?
you know what? It's highly unusual for us to be speaking like this
you're no longer a summer associate of mine
I know
I offered you a job and you turned me down
I didn't know who else talk to, mr.Nye
my advice to you, Ellen, is stop trying to figure Patty out
you'll never change her, but she'll change you
how?
by giving you access to how she thinks
you signed up for this, now keep your head down and do the work
that's why you're there, isn't it?
yes
then don't be shortsighted
start using her
learn everything you can, then get the hell out before it's too late
how exactly will I know when that is?
that's for another walk
Phil, there's another credit card charge
you're going to have to be a little more specific than that, sweetheart $1, 200 for a place called frolic
that's a gentlemen's club. I told you about it
the singapore clients come to the city, they love that crap
I can't drag them out of the champagne room
fine, but this was last week and
and I was in london
I'll have a talk with Michael
what's an outcall?
Patty, I'll have a talk with him
what is it?
he must've hired strippers
hired them out?
you mean our son had them in our apartment?
maybe, maybe
Michael's too smart for this bullshit and it's getting out of hand
Jesus christ!
Patty, I'll handle this. You know, your plate is full
just-- I'll take care of it, all right?
yes
I'll take care of this
okay
told you
ten years. One box. One trip
you didn't deserve this
Thanks. I'll be okay
I know I'm only here because of your support
don't believe that for a second
How're you doing? You okay?
I am - Really - Good. I'm glad
you know that friend you told me about in the stables?
did you ever, uh you ever tell Patty about her?
I guess we probably shouldn't discuss business
sorry. You're right. You're absolutely right
I got a cab waiting for me downstairs anyway
you take care of yourself, Ellen - Thanks, tom - All right
I'll see you around
Hey, are you following me?
I don't know what you're talking about?
you killed my dog. You killed my dog!
I don't you or your dog - Get away from me!
lady, back off!
stay away from me!
I am going to call the police - Screw you! - Are you okay?
screw you, asshole!
Jesus, mary, and joe cocker, what a fine surprise!
gentlemen, we do rise to our feet when a lady enters
it's signed goddamn it!
that's wonderful news
it's "all systems go" for your restaurant
you got what you want. Just leave me alone!
and to think, for a reasonable fee, she's available to cater any occasion
come on, god damn it
Yeah, where, where the hell have you been?
look, I just heard from Ray Fiske
she signed the papers. Call it off?
we could do that right?
we can call it off?
no, yeah, but can we call it off?
answer my...god!
shit. God hello. god damn it!
Oh, my god
hi there, I'm Arthur
I just came by to say hello
I hear it's full steam ahead for the opening
Oh, hey! My god, I love this
MrFiske told me that you, uh, you signed our agreement
you have no idea how grateful I am
lawyers, right?
they make such a big deal over a little, a little red tape
you and I, uh if I recall god those are beautiful
we never really spoke when we were down in Florida, did we?
no, no, that's right - Yeah
I don't mean to be rude, but i didn't even really remember who you were
look, I'm not sure what
but your meals! Oh, my god
who could forget that?
well, it was kobe beef, fingerling
Mr.Frobisher, I
and just a sprinkle of - saffron - Right god that was great
are you gonna have that on the menu?
look, Mr.Frobisher, I'm, I'm gonna go now, but please you stay as long as
no, no, I'm sorry. No, please, forgive me
I just wanted to come by and say, say thank you
isn't life great sometimes? I mean you, you and I we meet as total strangers at some boring luncheon down in florida, and the next thing you know we're, we're partners, making something absolutely beautiful
our fates are intertwined, Katie
isn't that remarkable?
I'm sorry to have bothered you. Thank you, Katie
why did you call me?
because you're right
I lied
the day I cooked for Frobisher
so this was, um, about june 2002?
yeah Saturday morning the 19th,
I was rushing to work and got pulled over
why didn't you put it in your timeline?
it's all so humiliating
I met a guy down in florida, had a stupid one night stand
it was a low point for me
I was kind of a mess back then
a guy. Whose name is
I never got a last name
we met friday night
partied pretty hard and went back to his place
he seemed like a genuinely nice guy
sure
then saturday morning I overslept
which is why I was late, rushing to work, and why I got pulled over
did you see him again?
no. But I got pregnant
and it was the one night and, uh, I never even got his phone number
and I just did what I had to do
I'm sorry
ms. Hewes, I swear this is the only thing I left out
everything else is in there
when did Frobisher's people approach you?
Fiske called me, uh, about a week later, and said that Arthur Frobisher liked my cooking and wanted to help me open a restaurant
and what happened to greg?
no idea
ever since Frobisher's been in the news, there's never been a connection
I've never heard his name, never seen him, nothing
you do understand why I lied to you, right?
yeah
then will you still be able to use me as a witness?
well, you and I will go over your timeline step by step
hopefully, they'll be something that will impeach Frobisher's story
but kate you're stepping into the spotlight now
details of your life are going to come out
this kind of scrutiny is never easy for anyone
I understand
it's just my brother and Ellen don't know anything about this stuff
you don't have to tell them, do you?
well, at some point the truth is gonna have to come out
I'll let you decide when
I spoke to Katie last night
you're working, if it's a bad time I can
no, no, uh. what did she say?
well you were right
she's not hiding anything. I trust her
but I want you to know that I had reasons for doing what I did
when I read her confidentiality agreement, there was a section I found curious
yeah?
ray Fiske had snuck in a medical release waiver
Katie signed away access to her medical records?
well, fiske must think that, um there's something in Katie's past that would destroy her credibility as a witness
well, there isn't
well, let's hope not
meanwhile, she's given them everything they want, so - She's protected - Yes
and you've had a very good first week
what are these for?
a quiet, little place on the upper west side
nice light, safe street
I think you'll like it
how did you
Katie mentioned you were looking for an apartment
Oh, I can't possibly accept, msHewes, I
please, please. You got a great bargain
I did?
I know the head of the co-oboard
Ellen, next time you need something, come to me - Hey - Hey
been a long time
yeah
I was, uh, a little surprised you called
I didn't think I'd ever see you again
Greg, we need to talk
about what?
florida
Owen, medium rare, rare?
medium rare
here we go. Oh, yeah
here you are
that one right there
Thanks, dad - Here you go, mom - Thank you
looks pretty good
all right, uh, who knows a joke? Anyone got a joke?
I do. Knock, knock
who's there?
interrupting lawyer - Interrupting lawyer - I object!
not too bad
not too bad, where'd you hear that one?
who wants chips? - I do
we have salad
I think Katie's lying about the guy she met in florida
I think she's lying about a lot of things
Katie Connor to see msHewes
I thought you might use a friend
for me?
Oh, my god, he's adorable
he's a rescue
Oh, thank you so much
it's my pleasure no more secrets between us
no more secrets
Oh, my god
Oh, my god
this place is ridiculous!
Oh, my god - It's too big!
we'll get lost - This is amazing
what's in here?
Oh, this is off the hook, look at this - Oh, my god - This is huge!
Oh, my god, Patty even sent the welcoming committee
this place is perfect
my God.
what happened?
I didn't kill David.
someone tried to kill me.
Arthur Frobisher told his employees to invest in the companyand then sold his own stock.
we don't have a case unless we can connect Frobisher with his broker.
you're my sister.
how do you know Arthur Frobisher?
you and I, we meet at some boring luncheon down in Florida, and the next thing you know, we're-we're partners.
Katie, this whole case turns on one weekend, and you were there.
you're stepping into the spotlight now.
details of your life are going to come out.
I think Katie's lying about the guy she met in Florida.His name is Gregory Malina.
do you remember we actually saw him down in Florida?
if you do know something, you should come down and speak to the lawyers with me.
the only time I saw Frobisher was with you.
if Patty Hewes gets that girl in front of a jury, all bets are off.
ten years, one box, one trip.
you didn't deserve this.
I miss seeing you around the office, Tommy.
everyone thinks you were actually canned.
what is it, Tom?
following Katie Connor?
I'm a lawyer, Patty.
I miss it.
Hey, everybody wants to know when you're going to get here.
I have no idea.
the decision's yours.
Ellen was still there when I left at 9: 15.
well, interesting choice.
palm
beach
florida
can I just say what a bad idea this is?
what the hell was that?
come on, follow me.
wait, wait, wait.
how many drinks did you have?
the two, with Gregory, and then before that maybe another beer.
and no drugs?
no drugs.
and you never caught his last name.
we have been over this.
it's no like it was a formal date.
I love Florida!
let's go to another club. Come on.
Oh, I can't.
I got a big day tomorrow-- I've gotta be up early. I can't.
who doesn't?
if you don't go to sleep, you don't have to wake up, right?
Oh, God.
okay!
wait for me!
and you didn't see Frobisher in the nightclub?
no, I didn't even know what he looked like until the parking lot.
you live in Brooklyn, too?
it's better in the the boroughs.
I live in Williamburg.
isn't that crazy?
you come all the way to Florida and meet someone who lives, like, five minutes away.
what are you doing down here?
business. You?
Oh, shit.
friends of yours?
I wish.
that's Arthur Frobisher.
the guy's got more money than Trump.
you think that guy eats beef?
I think that guy eats small cows for breakfast.
I'm catering a function for him tomorrow.
Ah, you're a cook.
we prefer to say "chef."
I'm a waiter.
I guess that means I'm beneath you.
not yet.
you want me to keep going?
we still don't have enough unless you can identify the man who got in the limo.
I only saw him for, like, a split second.
is there anything you can remember?
was he tall, short?
young, old?
it was five years ago.
but I can tell you that he wasn't any of these people you showed me from the government trial.
and what about your one-night stand?
Greg lived in Williamsburg. He was a waiter.
he was staying in his friend's condo.
which we can't find because you don't remember what part of town you were in.
why don't you try hypnosis?
it helped me quit smoking.
still stuck in the parking lot?
afraid so.
hmm. Well, you know what's going to happen if we don't come up with anything?
the clients are going to accept Frobisher's settlement.
unless Katie turns out to be a viable witness.
what is this?
a Ding Dong.
a what?
a Ding Dong.
it's delicious.
go home. It's late.
try again tomorrow.
it tastes like a Ho Ho.
ms. Connor, is that your brother?
y... Yes!
Oh, my...
Oh, God!
his mother.
what?
why not? He's been there a week.
he's entitled to phone privileges.
listen...
I've waited seven days to talk to my son, and now you're telling me I can't?
fine.
I said fine.
I'll call again next week.
Mr. Frobisher's case is fully staffed.
we're billing roughly $550, 000 per month.
and the payments?
always prompt.
our client's aware of all the exigencies one encounters when trying a case against Patty Hewes.
ray, what does she have that she has not accepted Mr. Frobisher's settlement offer?
nothing.
ms. Hewes has been unable to provide even one significant witness.
she's failed to produce any evidence that Mr. Frobisher breached his duty to his employees, or participated in the alleged fraud that she...
Yes, Amos?
you know how much Mr. Frobisher's case means to this firm.
get it done.
Yes, sir.
roughly 5, 200 employees are involved in the suit.
Arthur Frobisher-- he wiped out our whole retirement account.
$1. 4 billion.
gone.
so, you know, most of us, we just lost everything we had.
you have to stop torturing yourself.
you're doing everything you can.
am I?
Yes, Katie, you are.
Patty needs to know who got in that limo with Frobisher.
and she keeps asking about you
my one-night stand.
what if I can't keep this up?
what if I slip, or they back me into a corner or something?
you're going to be fine. Okay?
maybe you should come in.
why won't you just talk to them?
and tell them what?
I saw the same thing you did.
maybe you'd remember something if you saw the pictures.
Hey, if I go in there, then my wife is going to find out about us, and then we'll be over, and I don't want that.
it's not about us.
it's about Frobisher and those people whose lives he ruined.
Patty is the only one holding him responsible for this.
you really think Patty Hewes cares about you?
here is the complete dossier on Katie Connor.
is she still seeing Gregory?
almost every day.
you think she knows anything?
I'm not sure.
keep an eye on her.
if she's going to give us something, she's going to have to get it from him.
my guy says he can get Greg's stock portfolio by the end of the week.
good.
no. No, it's not good, Patty.
this kind of thing could get me disbarred.
are you okay?
I'm fine.
are you still on the board of the Jazz Society at Lincoln Center?
Why?
well, the head of the Trilling School is on it, too, and I was wondering if you'd put in a word in for Megan...
Tom, wake up.
people think I fired you.
what is it?
what is?
it was the ICU.
I assisted on my first bypass yesterday, and the patient's not doing so hot.
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
the family looks at you like you're God.
if they only knew...
shit.
so much for exercise.
what?
what are you doing tonight?
I got a couple hours.
so?
catch a movie?
I'm in.
movie, tonight.
you got your saxophone, sweetheart?
I'm holding it.
daddy, I'm going to be late for assembly.
okay, okay.
you look bellisima.
Bye, Dad.
Bye-bye.
good luck with the solo.
I'll be thinking of you.
you didn't tell me she was a musician.
Martin, twice in one week.
we got to stop meeting like this.
I was hoping we could finish Monday's chat.
I appreciate the offer.
I've been doing some soul searching
I'm just not ready to start work yet.
bullshit.
I know what's going on between you and Patty.
excuse me?
the whole world sees it.
she treats you like dirt for ten years, won't share the spotlight, then she refuses to make you a partner.
you don't know what you're talking about, Martin.
sure, I don't.
you're not a battered wife defending her abusive husband to the end, huh?
Oh, geez.
Yeah, that's it. No, you got it.
that's me.
you know, your little girl-- she's terrific.
she's the best thing that's ever happened to me.
she serious with the music?
Yeah, she's pretty serious, considering she's ten.
I ask 'cause I know that she's got an application at Trilling.
how do you know that?
well, I'm president elect of the parents' board.
you guys have put together an outstanding app.
good, good.
Megan's got her heart set on Trilling.
all her friends are going.
got to say, it sure is tough though to accept an applicant whose father checks the "unemployed" box.
don't do this.
come on, take it easy, Tom.
there are other schools.
some of them even pretty good.
but, at Trilling, we've got the music department in the entire city.
harvard, Yale, Princeton without Trilling, they don't have orchestras.
I'd love to see Megan get in.
comedy or drama?
I'm sorry?
I heard you telling that other doctor that you were going to go see a movie.
Oh, I'm sorry you overheard my personal conversation.
Oh, I shouldn't have been listening.
I want you to know that we are doing everything that we can to make your grandfather comfortable.
I know. Thanks.
and I really appreciate all the time you take with him.
you've been great.
so...
comedy or drama?
uh, I don't know.
I was thinking maybe the Cassavetes retrospective at Film Forum.
I've never heard of that.
is it funny?
no.
it's pretty serious.
70s stuff.
I guess I'm more the drama type.
Oh, not me.
I love comedies.
you know, they're just so funny.
Oh, oh, check it out.
my grandpa got me into these old radio shows.
here.
who is this?
it's Jack Benny.
it's good.
grandpa loves the guy, so I downloaded it for him.
that'll be nice.
Yeah. Well...
enjoy your big night out.
thank you.
and have some popcorn for me.
cause I'll be here.
sure thing.
Oh, and Dr. Conner...
be a little naughty.
excuse me?
get something chocolate.
you got it.
Hey, can you come in tomorrow?
I pulled more photos to run by you.
minor players, but we should check them out.
okay, I can try.
cool. I'll be in the office at 8: 00.
look, I got to go.
what are you doing here?
I know who he is.
the guy in the limo.
with Frobisher?
Katie, I don't want to get involved in any of this, okay?
but you saw his face.
I didn't know who he was when we first saw him.
then I recognized him on Court TV.
they did this thing on Frobisher's broker during the criminal trial.
and who is he?
what's his name?
his name is Luke Richards.
he was one of the broker's assistants.
but Ellen said all of the assistants had alibis.
well, Richards must be lying, because I definitely saw him.
Gregory, if you could have linked Frobisher to his broker, why didn't you tell me?
because I'm not going to get involved.
What?! Why not?!
I don't want to be another Kato Kalen.
let 15 minutes of bullshit ruin the rest of my life.
Gregory, for Jes...
no, no.
maybe I'm an asshole, but I'm not going to let these people use me and throw me away.
which is exactly what they're going to do.
okay, well, forget about them.
what about me?
I have risked everything I have to put this guy away, and now you're just going...
going to be a selfish prick? Yeah.
and you should, too.
think about it, Katie.
you're going to lose your restaurant, your privacy, any shot at having a normal life.
I do care about you.
I don't want to see you get hurt.
stay out of it.
just stay out of it, okay?
DARRELL Goldstein interned at Frobisher's company.
no, not him.
paul Ordell-- he was a temp.
no.
Katie, what is it?
Hi, there.
I'm Arthur.
Oh, my God.
you want me to be a witness against Frobisher?
Yes, if you know something.
she's going to be screwed.
she will lose everything, won't she?
nothing. Keep going.
no, not him.
no, not him.
you and I, we never really spoke when we were down in Florida, did we?
no, no, that's right.
I want the straight story, and until you tell me, you're worthless to me.
I don't give a shit about you.
no, go back to that other guy.
no, before him.
Yeah, him.
you recognize him?
when was this picture taken?
last year. Why?
Yeah, he was younger, but...
but what?
it could be Luke Richards.
I think this could be the guy.
the guy you saw get in the limo with Frobisher?
Yeah.
but a second ago you said it wasn't him.
because he looked familiar, and...
Yeah, this is definitely him.
Katie, are you 100% sure?
it's okay if you're not.
our fates are intertwined, Katie.
isn't that remarkable?
I'm sure.
who is he, anyway?
Richards was an assistant to Frobisher's broker.
you're kidding. Seriously?
you farted in your sleep last night.
you're on speaker.
classic.
my bad.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
it's a great day,
Oh, yeah?
Why's that?
your sister really came through today.
we're moving forward.
Oh, God.
we're going to prepare Katie's testimony.
what?
she made an ID.
babe, are you busy?
uh... yeah, kind of.
can I, um... can we talk tonight?
Yeah, sure.
I don't think he's getting much sleep.
I don't think he's getting laid.
Hey, okay, too far.
find out where he was on the Frobisher weekend.
all right, Patty,
I'll look into it.
make me an offer.
I'm ready to listen.
>> Bad news, Ray.
looks like they got a witness.
such a sweet girl.
I was hoping it wasn't going to come to this.
Patty's brought in Roger Kastle.
who's he?
big name in medical malpractice.
he's kind of a legend.
is he a sleazeball?
Patty's asked him to play the role of Ray Fiske.
perfect.
and you're certain this is the man you saw enter Mr. Frobisher's limousine?
Yes, 100% certain.
okay.
good.
so, Ms. Connor, how would you characterize your stay at the Maxwell Clinic?
what do you mean?
I was simply wondering if your stint in rehab was successful.
you had an extremely difficult time overcoming your drug addiction, did you not?
eyes on me, Ms. Connor.
how is this relevant?
blurred vision, paranoia, auditory hallucinations, unfortunately, are all documented long-term side effects of serious cocaine abuse.
I did one line in the parking lot.
but earlier that evening, how many lines did you do in the club?
and more importantly, how much cocaine had you consumed prior to that night?
I don't know.
enough not to remember?
no, I didn't say that.
and this mystery man who supplied you with cocaine, what was his last name?
I don't remember.
I'm better with faces.
Oh, so yours is more of a visual memory?
Yes.
was he circumcised?
was he circumcised, Ms. Connor?
you're kidding, right?
well, now you said you went back to his condo.
so what?
so I assumed you had intercourse.
no.
then why six weeks later did you schedule a procedure at Hudson General to terminate your pregnancy?
Jesus Christ.
ms. Hewes, maybe we should take a break.
I thought we had an understanding.
ms. Connor, would you characterize your life as one big blur of narcotics and intercourse?
would you characterize yourself as an asshole?
let the record reflect that the witness is refusing...
somebody shut this guy up!
Katie, sit down.
wow, she's not ready.
you signed their medical release waiver.
go on, sit down.
I told you that the truth would have to come out eventually.
I also warned you that the spotlight is a pretty goddamn awful place to be.
and Mr. Kastle's right, you're not ready for it.
because this deposition isn't about the facts.
it's about Katie Connor and do we like her and is she credible.
Yes, you saw this man in Florida, but it's your word against theirs.
and if Ray Fiske can embarrass you, piss you off, rattle you in any way, it's over.
he's done what he's set out to do neutralize your testimony and weaken our case.
Katie, why don't we go outside for a moment?
no, I want to keep going.
good.
try again.
Oh, my God.
can I talk to her?
not until her attorney gets back.
you really think she killed my brother?
they were due to get married in two weeks.
Katie, you didn't know they called off their engagement?
no. No.
we had a falling out, we haven't spoken in months.
Katie, why didn't you tell me?
what, that I got pregnant and ended up in rehab?
isn't it obvious?
I wanted to forget it ever happened and then... this case.
what about Gregory?
he never even knew you were...
no, I never had a chance to tell him the truth.
...the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
ms. Connor, thank you for joining us today.
and many thanks to the plaintiff's attorney for the use of her conference room.
now, as for the subject of today's deposition,
I've been instructed by the court to limit my questions to the 18th and the 19th of June, 2002.
those dates ring a bell for you,
ms. Connor?
Yes, sir.
I was in Palm Beach, working for a catering company at that time.
we were doing a business event for Arthur Frobisher.
ms. Connor, do you recognize the man in this photo?
Yes, that's Arthur Frobisher.
and the man in this photo?
thank you, Ms. Connor.
let the record reflect that the witness has correctly identified both men.
now, Ms. Connor, if you permit me to cut to the chase...
you claim that you saw these men together early morning on June 19, do you not?
Yes, I did.
and where did this alleged sighting take place?
in a parking lot on the 200 block of Ocean Avenue.
Mr. Frobisher was in a limousine and Mr. Richards got into that limousine.
and where were you when this happened?
I was in that same parking lot.
alone?
no, sir.
with whom were you in this parking lot?
with a man I met in a club earlier that evening.
if these next few questions make you blush,
ms. Connor,
I apologize.
to screw.
I'm sorry?
that's why I was in an empty parking lot in the middle of the night.
and later on a couch and then on the floor.
do you find cocaine is like Viagra?
if these past few answers make you blush, Mr. Fiske,
I apologize.
so you saw Mr. Richards get into a limo when it was parked, what, 25, 30 yards away?
I got my best look at his face as he left.
he turned his face toward the window.
I couldn't have been more than ten feet away at the time.
and this was when exactly?
between 1: 15 and 1: 45 a. m.
you checked your watch.
gunshots forced us to leave the club.
it's my understanding that the police report documents this at approximately 1: 15 a. m.
so, you saw Mr. Frobisher with Mr. Richards some time after 1: 15 a. m.
Saturday morning June 19, 2002.
I remind you, you're under oath, Ms. Connor.
Yes, that's when I saw them.
would you agree that a man can't be in two places at once?
objection to form.
vague and ambiguous argument.
noted.
go ahead, Katie, you can answer.
Yeah, I'd agree.
a man cannot be in two places at once.
so, when Mr. Richards told investigators he was at the Jersey shore with a college buddy pulling cod out of the Atlantic, it's your contention he was lying.
Yes, sir.
mine, too.
let's not get cute here, Counsel.
ms. Connor, can you identify the man in Exhibit 15?
objection.
this exhibit was not made available to us during discovery.
we've only just discovered this ourselves.
we have every intention of producing it to Ms. Hewes at the close of this deposition.
noted.
you can answer.
the man in the picture,
ms. Connor.
and the text there... what does that say?
out loud, Ms. Connor.
but this isn't true.
ms. Connor,
I'm not asking for an opinion,
I'm asking you to read.
now what does it say?
june 19, 2002, 1:37 a. m.
let the record reflect that Exhibit 15 shows
Mr. Richards withdrawing cash from an ATM located at 333 Casino East Boulevard, which is where,
ms. Connor?
I'm telling you Luke Richards was in that parking lot.
can you read the last four words, Ms. Connor?
I am not lying, he was there.
the last four words.
atlantic City, New Jersey.
but I swear to God, he was in that parking lot.
Luke Richards did lie, Ms. Connor, but I suspect it had everything to do with that woman standing next to him with the muscular arms and Adam's apple.
he wasn't hiding Arthur Frobisher's transgressions, he was hiding his own.
why are you lying?
objection.
Argumentative.
this is bullshit!
I think we're finished here.
you hear that, Patty?
that's the sound of the zeroes dropping off of Mr. Frobisher's revised offer.
I heard everything went well.
the threat's gone.
she lied under oath.
I want you to know, we ruined her life.
if you kept your dick in your pants, we wouldn't have had to.
it's been five years.
starting today,
I want you guys to leave me alone.
just let me live my life.
I don't think that's going to happen.
I don't even think she remembers you.
did I ask what you think?
let's go to another club. Come on.
Oh, I can't!
I got a big day tomorrow!
I can't!
who doesn't?
if you don't go to sleep, you don't have to wake up, right?
right? Huh?
okay!
wait for me!
five years from now, what is Katie Connor doing?
I'd like my own little restaurant in Brooklyn, but that is not going to happen.
why not?
because I have got the biggest gig in my life tomorrow, and I've got to be at work in five hours, and I am, like, totally wired.
Oh...
relax.
Hey, hey, relax.
here, try one of these.
you'll be out in ten minutes.
I'm going to hit the shower.
okay...
only the white ones, okay?
hmm.
you were right, you know?
gregory turns out to be our missing link.
gregory Malina owned Frobisher stock?
guess when he cashed out.
june, 2002.
Katie Connor never knew what hit her.
but you had the photo before anyone, so why would you let her be deposed if you knew she wouldn't hold up as a witness?
because now Ray Fiske thinks we don't have anything.
and watch, his next step will be to pull the settlement offer.
which is what you wanted all along.
Why? Why would you do this to me? Why?!
Katie, Katie, come here.
don't touch me.
you lied to me, asshole!
Hey, hey, hey...
Greg, are you cool?
Yeah, yeah, we're fine.
you lied to me!
why did you lie to me?!
answer my question!
why don't you just call me later, okay?
Yeah, I'll call you later.
I'll call your wife later.
>> Dude, you're married now?
why would you do this to me, Gregory?
I'm sorry.
go to hell.
this is your solution?
Katie, what about the restaurant?
you can't just run away from this.
I know. I tried.
you wouldn't let me.
what?
this is my fault?
I only tried to help your case.
Katie, you perjured yourself.
people go to jail for that.
there was an answer you wanted, and you hounded me until you got it.
that is bullshit.
you know, you are not mad that I lied.
you are just pissed that I got caught and made you look bad.
I only ever wanted the truth.
no, Ellen, all you ever wanted was to impress Patty Hewes.
from day one,
I never wanted her involved in this!
I'm so sorry, Miss Hewes.
I thought I knew her.
I trusted her.
Katie's a very good liar, Ellen.
she had me fooled, too.
you're a lawyer, lies come with the territory.
will the clients accept a settlement now?
I assume so, which is too bad because I think we could have gotten them more, but Frobisher's in the driver's seat now.
it just doesn't make any sense.
Fiske had pictures.
he was right there waiting with Richard's alibi.
ray Fiske is a brilliant lawyer who made us look very foolish today.
it happens.
Ellen, I understand how it must hurt right now
what happened with Katie
but... there's a very important lesson to be learned from all this.
which is?
trust no one.
Hey.
listen, I don't want to be presumptuous.
I'm not available.
I'm engaged.
we can play this any way you like.
I don't even think she remembers you.
palm Beach 2002
my God.
what happened?
I didn't kill David.
someone tried to kill me.
Arthur Frobisher told his employees to invest in the companyand then sold his own stock.
we don't have a case unless we can connect Frobisher with his broker.
you're my sister.
how do you know Arthur Frobisher?
you and I, we meet at some boring luncheon down in Florida, and the next thing you know, we're-we're partners.
Katie, this whole case turns on one weekend, and you were there.
you're stepping into the spotlight now.
details of your life are going to come out.
I think Katie's lying about the guy she met in Florida his name is Gregory Malina.
do you remember we actually saw him down in Florida?
if you do know something, you should come down and speak to the lawyers with me.
the only time I saw Frobisher was with you.
if Patty Hewes gets that girl in front of a jury, all bets are off.
ten years, one box, one trip.
you didn't deserve this.
I miss seeing you around the office, Tommy.
everyone thinks you were actually canned.
what is it, Tom?
following Katie Connor?
I'm a lawyer, Patty.
I miss it.
Hey, everybody wants to know when you're going to get here.
I have no idea.
the decision's yours.
Ellen was still there when I left at 9: 15.
well, interesting choice.
palm
beach
florida
can I just say what a bad idea this is?
what the hell was that?
come on, follow me.
wait, wait, wait.
how many drinks did you have?
the two, with Gregory, and then before that maybe another beer.
and no drugs?
no drugs.
and you never caught his last name.
we have been over this.
it's no like it was a formal date.
I love Florida!
let's go to another club. Come on.
Oh, I can't.
I got a big day tomorrow-- I've gotta be up early. I can't.
who doesn't?
if you don't go to sleep, you don't have to wake up, right?
Oh, God.
okay!
wait for me!
and you didn't see Frobisher in the nightclub?
no, I didn't even know what he looked like until the parking lot.
you live in Brooklyn, too?
it's better in the the boroughs.
I live in Williamburg.
isn't that crazy?
you come all the way to Florida and meet someone who lives, like, five minutes away.
what are you doing down here?
business. You?
Oh, shit.
friends of yours?
I wish.
that's Arthur Frobisher.
the guy's got more money than Trump.
you think that guy eats beef?
I think that guy eats small cows for breakfast.
I'm catering a function for him tomorrow.
Ah, you're a cook.
we prefer to say chef.
I'm a waiter.
I guess that means I'm beneath you.
not yet.
you want me to keep going?
we still don't have enough unless you can identify the man who got in the limo.
I only saw him for, like, a split second.
is there anything you can remember?
was he tall, short?
young, old?
it was five years ago.
but I can tell you that he wasn't any of these people you showed me from the government trial.
and what about your one-night stand?
Greg lived in Williamsburg. He was a waiter.
he was staying in his friend's condo.
which we can't find because you don't remember what part of town you were in.
why don't you try hypnosis?
it helped me quit smoking.
still stuck in the parking lot?
afraid so.
hmm. Well, you know what's going to happen if we don't come up with anything?
the clients are going to accept Frobisher's settlement.
unless Katie turns out to be a viable witness.
what is this?
a Ding Dong.
a what?
a Ding Dong.
it's delicious.
go home. It's late.
try again tomorrow.
it tastes like a Ho Ho.
ms. Connor, is that your brother?
y... Yes!
Oh, my...
Oh, God!
his mother.
what?
why not? He's been there a week.
he's entitled to phone privileges.
listen...
I've waited seven days to talk to my son, and now you're telling me I can't?
fine.
I said fine.
I'll call again next week.
Mr. Frobisher's case is fully staffed.
we're billing roughly $550, 000 per month.
and the payments?
always prompt.
our client's aware of all the exigencies one encounters when trying a case against Patty Hewes.
ray, what does she have that she has not accepted Mr. Frobisher's settlement offer?
nothing.
ms. Hewes has been unable to provide even one significant witness.
she's failed to produce any evidence that Mr. Frobisher breached his duty to his employees, or participated in the alleged fraud that she...
Yes, Amos?
you know how much Mr. Frobisher's case means to this firm.
get it done.
Yes, sir.
roughly 5, 200 employees are involved in the suit.
Arthur Frobisher-- he wiped out our whole retirement account.
$1. 4 billion.
gone.
so, you know, most of us, we just lost everything we had.
you have to stop torturing yourself.
you're doing everything you can.
am I?
Yes, Katie, you are.
Patty needs to know who got in that limo with Frobisher.
and she keeps asking about you
my one-night stand.
what if I can't keep this up?
what if I slip, or they back me into a corner or something?
you're going to be fine. Okay?
maybe you should come in.
why won't you just talk to them?
and tell them what?
I saw the same thing you did.
maybe you'd remember something if you saw the pictures.
Hey, if I go in there, then my wife is going to find out about us, and then we'll be over, and I don't want that.
it's not about us.
it's about Frobisher and those people whose lives he ruined.
Patty is the only one holding him responsible for this.
you really think Patty Hewes cares about you?
here is the complete dossier on Katie Connor.
is she still seeing Gregory?
almost every day.
you think she knows anything?
I'm not sure.
keep an eye on her.
if she's going to give us something, she's going to have to get it from him.
my guy says he can get Greg's stock portfolio by the end of the week.
good.
no. No, it's not good, Patty.
this kind of thing could get me disbarred.
are you okay?
I'm fine.
are you still on the board of the Jazz Society at Lincoln Center?
Why?
well, the head of the Trilling School is on it, too, and I was wondering if you'd put in a word in for Megan...
Tom, wake up.
people think I fired you.
what is it?
what is?
it was the ICU.
I assisted on my first bypass yesterday, and the patient's not doing so hot.
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
the family looks at you like you're God.
if they only knew...
shit.
so much for exercise.
what?
what are you doing tonight?
I got a couple hours.
so?
catch a movie?
I'm in.
movie, tonight.
you got your saxophone, sweetheart?
I'm holding it.
daddy, I'm going to be late for assembly.
okay, okay.
you look bellisima.
Bye, Dad.
Bye-bye.
good luck with the solo.
I'll be thinking of you.
you didn't tell me she was a musician.
Martin, twice in one week.
we got to stop meeting like this.
I was hoping we could finish Monday's chat.
I appreciate the offer.
I've been doing some soul searching
I'm just not ready to start work yet.
bullshit.
I know what's going on between you and Patty.
excuse me?
the whole world sees it.
she treats you like dirt for ten years, won't share the spotlight, then she refuses to make you a partner.
you don't know what you're talking about, Martin.
sure, I don't.
you're not a battered wife defending her abusive husband to the end, huh?
Oh, geez.
Yeah, that's it. No, you got it.
that's me.
you know, your little girl-- she's terrific.
she's the best thing that's ever happened to me.
she serious with the music?
Yeah, she's pretty serious, considering she's ten.
I ask 'cause I know that she's got an application at Trilling.
how do you know that?
well, I'm president elect of the parents' board.
you guys have put together an outstanding app.
good, good.
Megan's got her heart set on Trilling.
all her friends are going.
got to say, it sure is tough though to accept an applicant whose father checks the "unemployed" box.
don't do this.
come on, take it easy, Tom.
there are other schools.
some of them even pretty good.
but, at Trilling, we've got the music department in the entire city.
harvard, Yale, Princeton without Trilling, they don't have orchestras.
I'd love to see Megan get in.
comedy or drama?
I'm sorry?
I heard you telling that other doctor that you were going to go see a movie.
Oh, I'm sorry you overheard my personal conversation.
Oh, I shouldn't have been listening.
I want you to know that we are doing everything that we can to make your grandfather comfortable.
I know. Thanks.
and I really appreciate all the time you take with him.
you've been great.
so...
comedy or drama?
uh, I don't know.
I was thinking maybe the Cassavetes retrospective at Film Forum.
I've never heard of that.
is it funny?
no.
it's pretty serious.
70s stuff.
I guess I'm more the drama type.
Oh, not me.
I love comedies.
you know, they're just so funny.
Oh, oh, check it out.
my grandpa got me into these old radio shows.
here.
who is this?
it's Jack Benny.
it's good.
grandpa loves the guy, so I downloaded it for him.
that'll be nice.
Yeah. Well...
enjoy your big night out.
thank you.
and have some popcorn for me.
cause I'll be here.
sure thing.
Oh, and Dr. Conner...
be a little naughty.
excuse me?
get something chocolate.
you got it.
Hey, can you come in tomorrow?
I pulled more photos to run by you.
minor players, but we should check them out.
okay, I can try.
cool. I'll be in the office at 8: 00.
look, I got to go.
what are you doing here?
I know who he is.
the guy in the limo.
with Frobisher?
Katie, I don't want to get involved in any of this, okay?
but you saw his face.
I didn't know who he was when we first saw him.
then I recognized him on Court TV.
they did this thing on Frobisher's broker during the criminal trial.
and who is he?
what's his name?
his name is Luke Richards.
he was one of the broker's assistants.
but Ellen said all of the assistants had alibis.
well, Richards must be lying, because I definitely saw him.
Gregory, if you could have linked Frobisher to his broker, why didn't you tell me?
because I'm not going to get involved.
What?! Why not?!
I don't want to be another Kato Kalen.
let 15 minutes of bullshit ruin the rest of my life.
Gregory, for Jes...
no, no.
maybe I'm an asshole, but I'm not going to let these people use me and throw me away.
which is exactly what they're going to do.
okay, well, forget about them.
what about me?
I have risked everything I have to put this guy away, and now you're just going...
going to be a selfish prick? Yeah.
and you should, too.
think about it, Katie.
you're going to lose your restaurant, your privacy, any shot at having a normal life.
I do care about you.
I don't want to see you get hurt.
stay out of it.
just stay out of it, okay?
DARRELL Goldstein interned at Frobisher's company.
no, not him.
paul Ordell-- he was a temp.
no.
Katie, what is it?
Hi, there.
I'm Arthur.
Oh, my God.
you want me to be a witness against Frobisher?
Yes, if you know something.
she's going to be screwed.
she will lose everything, won't she?
nothing. Keep going.
no, not him.
no, not him.
you and I, we never really spoke when we were down in Florida, did we?
no, no, that's right.
I want the straight story, and until you tell me, you're worthless to me.
I don't give a shit about you.
no, go back to that other guy.
no, before him.
Yeah, him.
you recognize him?
when was this picture taken?
last year. Why?
Yeah, he was younger, but...
but what?
it could be Luke Richards.
I think this could be the guy.
the guy you saw get in the limo with Frobisher?
Yeah.
but a second ago you said it wasn't him.
because he looked familiar, and...
Yeah, this is definitely him.
Katie, are you 100% sure?
it's okay if you're not.
our fates are intertwined, Katie.
isn't that remarkable?
I'm sure.
who is he, anyway?
Richards was an assistant to Frobisher's broker.
you're kidding. Seriously?
you farted in your sleep last night.
you're on speaker.
classic.
my bad.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
it's a great day,
Oh, yeah?
Why's that?
your sister really came through today.
we're moving forward.
Oh, God.
we're going to prepare Katie's testimony.
what?
she made an ID.
babe, are you busy?
uh... yeah, kind of.
can I, um... can we talk tonight?
Yeah, sure.
I don't think he's getting much sleep.
I don't think he's getting laid.
Hey, okay, too far.
find out where he was on the Frobisher weekend.
all right, Patty,
I'll look into it.
make me an offer.
I'm ready to listen.
bad news, Ray.
looks like they got a witness.
such a sweet girl.
I was hoping it wasn't going to come to this.
a mock deposition is just a tool to see where you're at in your testimony.
Patty's brought in Roger Kastle.
who's he?
big name in medical malpractice.
he's kind of a legend.
is he a sleazeball?
Patty's asked him to play the role of Ray Fiske.
perfect.
and you're certain this is the man you saw enter Mr. Frobisher's limousine?
Yes, 100% certain.
okay.
good.
so, Ms. Connor, how would you characterize your stay at the Maxwell Clinic?
what do you mean?
I was simply wondering if your stint in rehab was successful.
you had an extremely difficult time overcoming your drug addiction, did you not?
eyes on me, Ms. Connor.
how is this relevant?
blurred vision, paranoia, auditory hallucinations, unfortunately, are all documented long-term side effects of serious cocaine abuse.
I did one line in the parking lot.
but earlier that evening, how many lines did you do in the club?
and more importantly, how much cocaine had you consumed prior to that night?
I don't know.
enough not to remember?
no, I didn't say that.
and this mystery man who supplied you with cocaine, what was his last name?
I don't remember.
I'm better with faces.
Oh, so yours is more of a visual memory?
Yes.
was he circumcised?
was he circumcised, Ms. Connor?
you're kidding, right?
well, now you said you went back to his condo.
so what?
so I assumed you had intercourse.
no.
then why six weeks later did you schedule a procedure at Hudson General to terminate your pregnancy?
Jesus Christ.
ms. Hewes, maybe we should take a break.
I thought we had an understanding.
ms. Connor, would you characterize your life as one big blur of narcotics and intercourse?
would you characterize yourself as an asshole?
let the record reflect that the witness is refusing...
somebody shut this guy up!
Katie, sit down.
wow, she's not ready.
you signed their medical release waiver.
go on, sit down.
I told you that the truth would have to come out eventually.
I also warned you that the spotlight is a pretty goddamn awful place to be.
and Mr. Kastle's right, you're not ready for it.
because this deposition isn't about the facts.
it's about Katie Connor and do we like her and is she credible.
Yes, you saw this man in Florida, but it's your word against theirs.
and if Ray Fiske can embarrass you, piss you off, rattle you in any way, it's over.
he's done what he's set out to do neutralize your testimony and weaken our case.
Katie, why don't we go outside for a moment?
no, I want to keep going.
good.
try again.
Oh, my God.
can I talk to her?
not until her attorney gets back.
you really think she killed my brother?
they were due to get married in two weeks.
Katie, you didn't know they called off their engagement?
no. No.
we had a falling out, we haven't spoken in months.
Katie, why didn't you tell me?
what, that I got pregnant and ended up in rehab?
isn't it obvious?
I wanted to forget it ever happened and then... this case.
what about Gregory?
he never even knew you were...
no, I never had a chance to tell him the truth.
...the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
ms. Connor, thank you for joining us today.
and many thanks to the plaintiff's attorney for the use of her conference room.
now, as for the subject of today's deposition,
I've been instructed by the court to limit my questions to the 18th and the 19th of June, 2002.
those dates ring a bell for you,
ms. Connor?
Yes, sir.
I was in Palm Beach, working for a catering company at that time.
we were doing a business event for Arthur Frobisher.
ms. Connor, do you recognize the man in this photo?
Yes, that's Arthur Frobisher.
and the man in this photo?
thank you, Ms. Connor.
let the record reflect that the witness has correctly identified both men.
now, Ms. Connor, if you permit me to cut to the chase...
you claim that you saw these men together early morning on June 19, do you not?
Yes, I did.
and where did this alleged sighting take place?
in a parking lot on the 200 block of Ocean Avenue.
Mr. Frobisher was in a limousine and Mr. Richards got into that limousine.
and where were you when this happened?
I was in that same parking lot.
alone?
no, sir.
with whom were you in this parking lot?
with a man I met in a club earlier that evening.
if these next few questions make you blush,
ms. Connor,
I apologize.
to screw.
I'm sorry?
that's why I was in an empty parking lot in the middle of the night.
and later on a couch and then on the floor.
do you find cocaine is like Viagra?
if these past few answers make you blush, Mr. Fiske,
I apologize.
so you saw Mr. Richards get into a limo when it was parked, what, 25, 30 yards away?
I got my best look at his face as he left.
he turned his face toward the window.
I couldn't have been more than ten feet away at the time.
and this was when exactly?
between 1: 15 and 1: 45 a. m.
you checked your watch.
gunshots forced us to leave the club.
it's my understanding that the police report documents this at approximately 1: 15 a. m.
so, you saw Mr. Frobisher with Mr. Richards some time after 1: 15 a. m.
Saturday morning June 19, 2002.
I remind you, you're under oath, Ms. Connor.
Yes, that's when I saw them.
would you agree that a man can't be in two places at once?
objection to form.
vague and ambiguous argument.
noted.
go ahead, Katie, you can answer.
Yeah, I'd agree.
a man cannot be in two places at once.
so, when Mr. Richards told investigators he was at the Jersey shore with a college buddy pulling cod out of the Atlantic, it's your contention he was lying.
Yes, sir.
mine, too.
let's not get cute here, Counsel.
ms. Connor, can you identify the man in Exhibit 15?
objection.
this exhibit was not made available to us during discovery.
we've only just discovered this ourselves.
we have every intention of producing it to Ms. Hewes at the close of this deposition.
noted.
you can answer.
the man in the picture,
ms. Connor.
and the text there... what does that say?
out loud, Ms. Connor.
but this isn't true.
ms. Connor,
I'm not asking for an opinion,
I'm asking you to read.
now what does it say?
june 19, 2002, 1:37 a. m.
let the record reflect that Exhibit 15 shows
Mr. Richards withdrawing cash from an ATM located at 333 Casino East Boulevard, which is where,
ms. Connor?
I'm telling you Luke Richards was in that parking lot.
can you read the last four words, Ms. Connor?
I am not lying, he was there.
the last four words.
atlantic City, New Jersey.
but I swear to God, he was in that parking lot.
Luke Richards did lie, Ms. Connor, but I suspect it had everything to do with that woman standing next to him with the muscular arms and Adam's apple.
he wasn't hiding Arthur Frobisher's transgressions, he was hiding his own.
why are you lying?
objection.
Argumentative.
this is bullshit!
I think we're finished here.
you hear that, Patty?
that's the sound of the zeroes dropping off of Mr. Frobisher's revised offer.
I heard everything went well.
MALINA: The threat's gone.
she lied under oath.
I want you to know, we ruined her life.
if you kept your dick in your pants, we wouldn't have had to.
it's been five years.
starting today,
I want you guys to leave me alone.
just let me live my life.
I don't think that's going to happen.
I don't even think she remembers you.
did I ask what you think?
let's go to another club. Come on.
Oh, I can't!
I got a big day tomorrow!
I can't!
who doesn't?
if you don't go to sleep, you don't have to wake up, right?
right? Huh?
okay!
wait for me!
five years from now, what is Katie Connor doing?
I'd like my own little restaurant in Brooklyn, but that is not going to happen.
why not?
because I have got the biggest gig in my life tomorrow, and I've got to be at work in five hours, and I am, like, totally wired.
Oh...
relax.
Hey, hey, relax.
here, try one of these.
you'll be out in ten minutes.
I'm going to hit the shower.
okay...
only the white ones, okay?
hmm.
you were right, you know?
gregory turns out to be our missing link.
gregory Malina owned Frobisher stock?
guess when he cashed out.
june, 2002.
Katie Connor never knew what hit her.
but you had the photo before anyone, so why would you let her be deposed if you knew she wouldn't hold up as a witness?
because now Ray Fiske thinks we don't have anything.
and watch, his next step will be to pull the settlement offer.
which is what you wanted all along.
Why? Why would you do this to me? Why?!
Katie, Katie, come here.
don't touch me.
you lied to me, asshole!
Hey, hey, hey...
Greg, are you cool?
Yeah, yeah, we're fine.
you lied to me!
why did you lie to me?!
answer my question!
why don't you just call me later, okay?
Yeah, I'll call you later.
I'll call your wife later.
dude, you're married now?
why would you do this to me, Gregory?
I'm sorry.
go to hell.
this is your solution?
Katie, what about the restaurant?
you can't just run away from this.
I know. I tried.
you wouldn't let me.
what?
this is my fault?
I only tried to help your case.
Katie, you perjured yourself.
people go to jail for that.
there was an answer you wanted, and you hounded me until you got it.
that is bullshit.
you know, you are not mad that I lied.
you are just pissed that I got caught and made you look bad.
I only ever wanted the truth.
no, Ellen, all you ever wanted was to impress Patty Hewes.
from day one,
I never wanted her involved in this!
I'm so sorry, Miss Hewes.
I thought I knew her.
I trusted her.
Katie's a very good liar, Ellen.
she had me fooled, too.
you're a lawyer, lies come with the territory.
will the clients accept a settlement now?
I assume so, which is too bad because I think we could have gotten them more, but Frobisher's in the driver's seat now.
it just doesn't make any sense.
Fiske had pictures.
he was right there waiting with Richard's alibi.
ray Fiske is a brilliant lawyer who made us look very foolish today.
it happens.
Ellen, I understand how it must hurt right now
what happened with Katie
but... there's a very important lesson to be learned from all this.
which is?
trust no one.
Hey.
listen, I don't want to be presumptuous.
I'm not available.
I'm engaged.
we can play this any way you like.
I don't even think she remembers you.
palm Beach 2002
did you get any word from Patty?
I've told her that she's got to come back here.
she doesn't want to come back.
you think Patty tried to kill you to protect herself?
I am trying to settle this case.
try harder.
she's divorcing me.
maybe I'll tell him about you and Gregory Malina.
give me five minutes, Ray.
I think George Moore engineered this whole hit- and-run.
I think he leaked arlington to get you to settle.
george Moore made a big show of going after Frobisher.
but you didn't believe he was?
I could get killed for what I told you.
if there's a connection between you and Arthur Frobisher, we will find it.
I spoke with George Moore.
how could you be so stupid?
don't bother coming back.
thanks for the advice...
but I guess I won't be needing this anymore.
what happened?
I told her I was sick of her bullshit.
you what?
Ellen, you're a first-year associate.
when Patty was my age, do you think she would have tolerated a boss like her?
no.
then why should I?
was this about the case?
sort of.
I uncovered some evidence on my own...
but Patty was more interested in putting me in my place than what I found.
I see, mm-hmm.
she says it's all about the case, but it's not.
it's about her and her mind games.
Yes.
I want the clients to win their case, but...
I'm not going to be Patty's punching bag.
Oh, you'll bounce back.
which is why I'm here, Mr. Nye.
I need a job.
the law will always be here, Ellen.
but, um, your wedding is coming up, isn't it?
Yes.
you know, I made similar mistakes early in my career.
never took a honeymoon.
don't let your life pass you by.
babe, this is a nightmare.
what is?
the seating arrangement.
it's more complicated than the bar exam.
can I sit your cousin Jake next to Heather?
why are you always trying to pimp Heather out, huh?
I just thought, you know, they both...
they both love hiking...
and narcotics.
they have lots to talk about.
how'd it go with Nye?
he wouldn't give me a job.
he told me to take a vacation.
I love this man.
all right, I will see you later.
okay? - Okay.
Hello, David.
may I come in?
do you want to call me later?
Yeah. I will.
I was wondering when you would show up.
you impressed me with this.
I wasn't trying to.
just take the information and use it.
it's all very intriguing, but how does it help our case?
george Moore was heading up the sec investigation into Frobisher's company, but according to a former sec investigator...
Laura Watkins.
I met with her.
she believed that Moore was making a big show of wanting to take down Frobisher, but behind the scenes he was torpedoing the investigation.
and all the rest of this
the hotel records, the rental car receipts, a flight manifest...
all show that George Moore was in Jacksonville, Florida the weekend before Frobisher sold his stock.
Moore drove down to palm beach to tip off Frobisher.
it's a nice theory.
no proof.
use it anyway.
put pressure on Moore.
to do what?
get Frobisher to settle.
I could never understand why Moore leaked arlington, but now it makes perfect sense.
he must be afraid of what would come out in a trial.
Moore wants the whole case to go away, and if he knows that you're closing in on him...
he'll give us more dirt we can use against Frobisher.
so...
we need to go back to Moore.
I think so.
and you're the only lawyer in my firm he'll talk to.
it's a nice apartment.
isn't it?
go back to Moore.
and...
of course you can have your job back.
I don't want it.
but I'll talk to Moore.
I want you to win this case.
our court date-- six weeks, folks.
Tom's running point, so if he needs you to do something, do it.
exhibits, witness prep.
it is deadline time.
Felicia, do you have the expert list?
you'll get it tomorrow.
that's it.
make your mothers proud.
where was Ellen this morning? - I don't know.
maybe she wasn't feeling well.
Tom, half the office saw her storm out the other day.
did Patty fire her?
just focus on the case.
everyone's talking about it.
what are we supposed to tell them? - Whatever you want.
tell them Ellen's dead.
just get me the goddamn expert list.
I hope she was fired.
I never liked her.
Hey.
what are you doing here?
I thought you could use some lunch.
what do we got here?
a nice filet, some asparagus, and some blackberry cobbler.
sweetie, this is stupendous.
I finished my meetings this morning, and i just realized how much I missed you.
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
this case has just taken over my life.
they all do, Ray, but this one...
this one's different.
I worry about you.
you're so quiet these days.
what?
you never accused me of that before.
well, it's true.
soon as the case is over, I'll be a regular ol' chatterbox again.
well, that'll be nice.
we'll take a few days, go see your sister in tacoma.
I'll believe that when I see it.
I promise.
sit, sit, eat.
Oh, that smells good.
37377.0
more wine?
why not?
we're going to be closing soon, so...
looks like I'm your last customer.
I suppose I just lost track of the time.
you're always coming in here with work. What do you do?
I'm an attorney.
you know, I don't believe I've ever caught your name.
ray.
a blackout?
you were probably still in kindergarten.
this was 1977, the very first week I arrived.
an auspicious debut. Shit.
guess when I got here.
when?
last september.
you don't say. Yeah.
before or after?
just before.
it almost made my change my mind, but then I thought...
if I leave now...
they win. Right.
I probably should have left, though.
Why's that?
I don't know, I...
I just can't...
get going, you know?
I live in a shithole, and I barely make enough to pay my rent.
why did you decide to move here in the first place?
I'll try anything once, I guess.
Oh, I'm sorry.
that's my wife.
you're married?
never seen her; you never bring her in.
Oh, I come in here to work, clear my head.
you like being an attorney?
I like the relationship between attorney and client.
there's an intimacy there, a trust.
someone puts himself in your hands.
and you like that.
I do.
what the hell are you doing here?
Oh, uh, a couple downstairs said the ceiling was dripping.
just, um...
checking for a leak.
and the lamp?
noticed a bulb was out.
does Ellen know that you're here?
no.
Patty Hewes told me to extra special care of you.
next time, you call me.
don't ever do this again.
6 DAYS LATER
you have 57 new messages.
Patty, it's Tom.
it's Tom.
I'm in rome now. I'm worried about you...
it's Tom...
Yeah, mom, I'm up at henry's. Everything's fine...
I don't know how to tell you this.
I just got a call from Hollis Nye...
somehow, Ellen's in jail.
I don't know how to tell you this.
I just got a call from Hollis Nye...
somehow, Ellen's in jail.
she was arrested for killing David.
how was sawgrass?
I'm sorry?
did you hit the green on 17 or end up in the drink?
depends on when you're talking about.
june, 2002.
you were in Jacksonville, Florida the weekend before Frobisher dumped his stock.
Ah, yes.
I hit the green.
I'm sure you did.
then you drove four hours to palm beach and tipped off Frobisher that the sec was about to release a report damning his company's finances.
Frobisher give you a nice kickback?
I was trying to prosecute Arthur Frobisher.
not according to Laura Watkins.
look, I don't know what you think...
I think you want this case to be over, and I think that we can help each other.
give us something on Frobisher.
and if I don't?
then Patty Hewes starts looking into you.
your finances, your investments, your bank accounts
anything you have hidden, she'll find it.
I told you, I can't give you Frobisher.
but I can give you somebody.
who?
same time, tomorrow night, meet me here.
I'll bring you a present.
Jesus...
you scared me.
you're so cute when you think you're alone. Yeah?
Ugh, I'm living life in reverse.
first breakfast then bed.
what's that?
it's our first wedding gift.
don't get too excited, though. It's from aunt Marge and uncle Fran.
a garden gnome?
we live in an apartment.
thank god your family has some taste.
what did Patty have to say?
she offered me my job back.
what did you say?
I said no.
good.
I don't like having her in our lives.
neither do I.
you want breakfast? - Sure
Aw, no.
who is it?
don't answer it.
but this is the third time she's called this week.
well, we need do something.
we need to talk.
how did it go with judge Toomey?
Patty, when are you going to announce Ellen's firing?
I'm-I'm-I'm running around the office, avoiding people's questions...
And?
and I'm a partner now, and I need you to treat me like one.
if you have plans for Ellen, I need to know them.
there are no plans.
then you should tell the associates that.
Ellen approached a key informant without our knowledge, and she was fired.
people should know that.
go announce it.
thank you.
you're right, you're a partner, I should start treating you like one.
goddamn it, Gregory, you had one task.
one task, and you screwed it up.
how was I supposed to know the guy was gonna show up early?
you shouldn't have been in the condo in the first place.
you were supposed to rent it, leave the key, and take a goddamn vacation.
I'm sorry, Ray.
but I'm telling you, the girl didn't see anything.
the important thing now is for you to say nothing.
you just forget any of this ever happened, understand?
Yes, I understand.
look, I'm sorry for raising my voice at you...
it's my fault.
I-I screwed up.
I'm the one who sent you down there.
listen.
that gift I gave you, for going down there...
the stock.
do yourself a favor.
sell it tomorrow.
give me a double scotch.
do you believe this?
I'm staying in a hotel room.
I can't be in that house anymore.
you better get me the best goddamn divorce attorney in this city.
of course.
one battle at a time.
thank you, that's enough.
we were right.
about what?
he sold you out.
Arlington...
gregory Malina...
it's all him.
so you're meeting with Moore again?
Yeah.
he won't give up Frobisher, but he's going to give us someone else.
you've got him desperate.
he's trying to make the case go away before it closes in on him.
if Moore tipped off Frobisher, that's a crime.
why shouldn't we just go after him for that?
because our clients come first.
criminal charges would take precedence.
our case could get pushed another three years.
we'll get there, Ellen...
once step at a time.
here.
what's this?
it should hold you over for a few weeks.
I'm not doing this for money.
I know you're not, but take it.
don't be foolish, Ellen.
everyone needs to eat.
mom? Yeah.
Oh, hey.
sorry to interrupt.
Michael, this is Ellen Parsons.
Hi.
nice to meet you, michael.
Yeah, cool.
are you using the car tonight?
me, henry and julius are going to head to Foxwoods.
to the casino?
you can't get in.
mom... fake ids?
you guys have a nice night.
she's kind of hot.
where the hell have you been? I've been waiting for over...
are you sure you're all right?
I'm fine.
here.
I'm sorry you went through that.
I hate these people.
photos link Ray fiske to Gregory Malina, and the documents prove that Fiske's guilty of insider trading.
you should be able to use that.
it's blackmail, Ellen.
just do what needs to be done.
so Mr. Frobisher offered $500 million to settle, and Patty Hewes turned it down.
at that price, this case should be over.
she's overplaying her hand.
gone and convinced herself that Arthur's outburst in that deposition room will be worth more to a jury than it actually is.
my grandfather adored you, Ray.
I'm told people thought you were his son.
he was a fine man, an even better mentor.
he'd be tickled pink to see what you've made of yourself, Marshall.
we all have the utmost respect here for you, Ray.
we truly do.
so I... I won't mince words.
the senior partners have lost confidence in your ability to effectively try this case.
you've got to be kidding me.
and as you know, Mr. Frobisher's case bears enormous consequence to the future well-being of this firm.
the partners want me to shadow you from here on out.
you'll consult me on any and all tactical decisions as we move to trial.
look, Arthur Frobisher is a stubborn man.
stubborn and complicated.
there are complexities to the case that are beyond the normal scope of...
Marshall, I'm sorry, no offense, but I'm going to have to talk this over with amos.
it's been decided.
I'll be looking over your shoulder every step of the way, so...
you'll turn over everything you've got, get me up to speed by the end of the week.
what do you have there, girl?
let me see.
come on.
come on, girl, open up.
don't you just love dogs?
Yeah.
they're like people.
only without the bullshit.
go play, girl, go.
client reps rethink the offer?
what's this?
it's our counter.
the wealthy patron who paid Gregory Malina's way down to Florida,
I'm guessing it was you, Ray.
Where'd you get these?
does it matter?
they're just pictures, Patty.
they don't mean... anything.
read the document.
you transferred stock to Gregory Malina, then told him to sell using information you got from your client.
I don't give a shit about your private life, Ray.
but I can't sit on this kind of information. - Patty...
unless you and I come to some arrangement.
there is no way Frobisher is going to offer you a better settlement.
I don't want one.
this case is going to be tried in a courtroom.
I am not tanking my own case at trial.
think about it, Ray.
take your time.
I don't have to think about it.
Frobisher's my client.
and my friend.
we wouldn't be having this conversation if Gregory Malina were still alive.
you're a baptist, right, Ray?
repent.
thank you.
Mr. Phillips wants to sit down with you later.
I'll be here.
I think we just got our second wedding gift.
Really? Yeah.
it's probably from aunt Barbara.
she told me she ordered something online last week.
okay, hang on, mom.
hang on. I'll open it.
you know, - Hang on.
ordering gifts on the internet is not as easy as people say.
I tried to find your name on the registry page, but there were six Ellen Parsons in new york alone.
anyway, you know this means you're going to have to start sending thank you notes.
Oh, my god.
what?
who would send this?
what is it?
honey, what is it?
I miss you David Love Lila
Hey, Ellen?
what's going on?
Yeah, do you still have Lila Dimeo's phone number?
Yeah, I think.
Hey, there, it's Lila.
sorry, I'm not around, but i bet ya know what to do and when to do it.
this is Ellen Parsons.
stay away from my fianc?
or I swear to god I will come after you, you crazy bitch.
2 DAYS LATER
we're done, Ellen.
Hello?
Li... stop, stop it.
just stop. Listen to me.
damn it, will you just-- no!
Lila, you need to stop calling me!
that was, uh...
that was great, Ray.
thanks for dinner.
had to celebrate your new job. - Yeah.
37438.0
it's gonna feel strange going to work in a suit.
looks good on you.
Thanks.
what is it?
we can't be in contact anymore.
why not?
looks like the government is charging my client.
I... I don't know anything.
you know enough.
we can't be seen together.
okay.
I'm gonna miss you, Gregory.
I'll miss you too, Ray.
what?
what is it?
no, Ray... - Gregory, please.
please...
no, Ray, come on. That's...
that's not who I am.
I don't believe you.
please.
Jesus, Ray!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Ray.
I'm sorry. I...
what is it, Ray?
george Moore is dead.
I heard.
I got a letter...
from Gregory Malina. - When?
it's over, Art.
what is?
it's over.
ray, what's over?
ray, what the hell are you talking ab...
Hey.
what time is it?
did you eat?
there's some grilled salmon in the fridge.
first thing in the morning...
we have to leave.
to go where, my sister's? - No...
we have to get out of the country.
I don't understand.
I'll explain everything Tomorrow.
right now I need you to pack our things.
ray, you have to tell me what...
you have to trust me.
will you do that?
yes...
Yes, of course.
okay.
I have a few things I have to take care of.
you got my message?
I did.
Yeah, so...
I've been mulling things over.
I'd like to sit down with you, see how we can work this out.
I'm glad to hear it, Ray.
we can get together first thing in the morning.
I'd prefer sooner.
I don't want this hanging over me, you understand?
of course.
what are you doing later tonight?
I can be anywhere you want me to be.
Yeah, it was the first movie I saw in, like, four months where I actually stayed awake.
OK -Yeah.
okay, babe. I love you.
love.
hey there, Ray.
Hello, Patty.
you want a drink?
Thanks, no.
well, sit.
how you holding up?
I've been better.
did I ever tell you why I became a lawyer, Ray?
no, you never told me.
I thought I could change the world.
silly, huh?
I just liked getting to wear a tie every day.
you and I are two sides of the same coin.
how's that?
we love the game.
another case, a bigger win.
it's an addiction like any other.
you're blackmailing me, Patty.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
long as we're clear.
Frobisher is guilty, Ray.
help me set things right.
you're a friend.
we bring out the best in each other.
after this, we have a hundred more rounds to go.
I don't see how that's possible.
I am not looking to destroy you.
we attorneys survive.
it's the clients that come and go.
I can't go into a courtroom...
and deliberately lose my case.
I know it will be painful, Ray.
but six months, a year from now, it'll all blow over, and you'll come work with me.
I'm serious.
you would do that?
hire the finest goddamn litigator I've ever come up against?
Yes, Ray.
Absolutely.
there's a place for you here.
it's win-win, for both of us.
okay, Patty.
good, Ray.
I'm glad.
you know...
I always wanted to work with you, Patty.
not anymore.
the photos link ray Fiske to Gregory Malina.
Patty used it as leverage against Fiske.
do you regret what we did? Because I do.
I did everything you asked me to.
you said I'd be taken care of.
Mr. Popler is leaking information to Frobisher's camp.
Ellen, it's me.
Katie brought you a videotape that Gregory Malina made.
do anything you have to do, but get me that tape.
we went to Patty Hewes' apartment.
we didn't find the tape.
no matter what you think,
I didn't have anything to do with any of this.
I know.
I've been accused of murder, and you're going to exonerate me.
then I'll give you the tape.
Ellen Parsons is out on bail.
you know where to find her.
you have one new message.
Ellen. Ellen, it's me.
look, there's something here that you really got to see.
Katie brought you a videotape that Gregory Malina made.
gregory confessed everything about what happened in Florida.
I'm going to leave it in our hiding place, okay?
you go in, you get the tape, and you get out.
you ready? - Yeah.
give me your penlight.
Where's yours? - I'm not sure.
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am. I'll take a look.
bloody, half-naked, wandering the streets at 7: 00 A. M.
just your type.
you get a name?
all we found on her was this.
Hollis M. Nye, attorney-at-law.
you her lawyer?
no. A friend.
you have a current address?
Yes, certainly.
she, uh, she lives with her fiance?
we have a problem.
the police just came to see me about Ellen Parsons.
10 DAYS LATER
your mom made these for us.
I'm accused of murder, and my mom bakes cookies.
sounds about right.
who attacked you?
I don't know.
I never saw him before.
your mom said Patty Hewes posted the bail.
she knows I'm innocent.
she's representing me now.
when is David's funeral?
I can't go.
why not?
conditions of my bail. I...
I can't travel.
Patty can petition the judge for an allowance.
I don't know if David's family even wants me to be there.
I am so sorry, El.
could you help me? I'm looking for lot 77.
Yeah, you want to stay on the path then swing a right at the oak grove.
thank you.
you don't look like you're from around here.
it's been 35 years.
3 DAYS LATER
anything I can do?
I'll be up in a minute.
how does ray Fiske's suicide affect our case?
judge Toomey granted the opposition a one-month continuance, Which we expected under the circumstances.
and Marshall Phillips has assumed lead counsel for Mr. Frobisher.
he a good attorney?
he's one of the best.
has there been another offer since we turned down the 500 million?
no, not yet.
I want to reiterate that none of what's happened can detract from our case.
we know what Frobisher did,
and we're ready to prove it to a jury.
your office is finished.
I promise you, Patty, the place is as good as new.
thank you, Pete.
DNA tests confirm that the blood of an unknown male was found in my apartment and on my client's clothing.
that corroborates her story that she was attacked.
by who?
there was no body found in your apartment.
our detectives did a thorough forensic search,
they canvassed the building, they talked to the neighbors.
the blood evidence... - is inconclusive at best.
no, Ms. Parsons still had the motive, the opportunity,
and her fingerprints were in the victim's blood on the murder weapon.
she explained that.
can you explain why her apartment was ransacked?
a file cabinet broken into with contents stolen?
I mean, not exactly consistent with a crime of passion, is it?
look, a young doctor was found murdered on riverside drive...
and people are scared, which is why you want this to go away quickly.
I mean, hell, if, if I lived on the upper west side,
I wouldn't sleep tonight.
in fact, I might not want to reelect my district attorney.
ms. Hewes, Ellen Parsons worked for you.
I don't think you can be objective about this. - I'm not!
I'm not objective at all, and I'm going to turn my passionate irrational anger against your office.
I am going to go on every talk show, Every media outlet I can find to expose - How you ignored key evidence in your incompetent rush to accuse... - Ms. Hewes...
how, for political ends,
you destroyed the life of an exceptional young woman,
while the real murderer walks the streets.
this would be a lot more pleasant if I were dealing with you, Hollis.
I tried to reason with my client,
but she insisted on Ms. Hewes representing her.
what do you want?
the DA's agreed to reopen the crime scene.
good. - Ellen...
you still know where the tape is?
of course.
and it's safe?
it's safe.
get the charges dropped, and it's yours.
Ellen pushed me aside.
shit.
who's representing her now?
she got the DA to reopen the murder investigation.
all right, how would you like us to play it?
has the videotape been put into evidence?
I don't think so. No.
then maybe Patty Hewes doesn't have it.
what are we doing, playing guessing games?
there's a goddamn gun out there pointed right at me,
and you don't know if it's loaded.
Jesus!
what about David Connor?
do I have to worry about him?
no.
there's nothing that could get back to you.
good. Christ, what a mess.
you're looking for anything incongruous,
anything that didn't belong to you and your fiance?
anything that's not in the right place.
take your time, Ms. Parsons.
excuse me.
Hey, Rick. - How's it going?
Hey, Rosie. - How you doing, Rick?
this is detective Rick Messer.
he asked if he could take a look around,
see if the scene fits the profile of a case he's working downtown.
no.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
I hope they find the guy.
can we have a moment, please?
1972/5/24
Hi.
I'm... Sorry, Patricia.
I'm terribly sorry.
Mr. Frobisher?
you wanted to see me? - Yeah. Yeah, I do. What...
she turned down $500 million, Larry.
what the hell's going on over there?
does she have something?
I don't know. She's not telling us anything.
then what do I have you for?
Larry, you know, you haven't given me anything in weeks.
what can I do?
all right, look.
has she said anything about a videotape?
think-- a videotape? A confession?
what? No.
I don't know nothing about that. What tape?
what are you talking about?
no... Forget it.
I got to tell you, Mr. Frobisher, ever since your deposition, - I don't think she's going to settle for any amount. - Goddamn it!
you know something-- I don't pay you to think. Do I, Larry?
you haven't paid me for anything, Mr. Frobisher... - I need facts, all right?
I need information, that's all I want. - Mr. Frobisher, I know!
no, you actually don't know!
you don't know shit, and you've done shit...
which is exactly what you're going to get from me.
I ain't paying you a penny.
I don't need your money, you prick!
I have to admit, I think there's something you're not telling me.
Arthur, why hasn't this case already settled?
what's this?
ray with Gregory Malina.
Jesus.
was ray having a thing with this kid? - I don't know.
maybe.
I mean, the kid's a hustler, for Christ sake. He's a liar.
ray brought him down to Florida the same weekend I was there.
the kid took advantage of him. He tried to extort money from him.
how?
he made up some bullshit videotape, confessing crap that never happened.
what did happen in Florida, Arthur?
palm Beach 2002
I stepped into that condo and she was staring right at me.
that girl was high and out of her mind.
my assistant assured me, she didn't see a thing.
and you believed him?
Hey, relax.
we'll take care of the girl.
you have my word on that.
now tell me.
it's not good.
this is the report we're going to be filing next week.
the SEC has evidence that the accounting fraud in your company has been going on for years.
what kind of evidence?
you use shell corporations to hide your debt.
you book potential earnings as current earnings to artificially boost profits.
I can't even tell what I'm looking at here.
I've known you 40 years.
don't give me that shit, Arthur.
what happened in Florida?
nothing.
absolutely nothing.
so this tape...
have you viewed it?
no. - Did ray?
I don't know. But...
Malina wrote him a letter saying the tape was out there.
and you think patty has it?
she might.
well...
there's a way to find out.
we file for summary judgment.
we get the judge to rule on the case now.
it'll force patty to show her hand.
but what if she does have the tape?
well, then at least we'll know where we stand.
but if she doesn't, based on the evidence I've seen, I'm betting the judge will dismiss the whole case.
summary judgment.
why wait for a trial when a judge can decide the case now?
if I file today, this all could be over by next month.
we're going to trial.
I'll be in touch.
turn this over to a judge? What is he, crazy?
he's desperate.
he needs to know if we have the tape.
so Phillips is forcing your hand?
I need the tape, Ellen.
if the judge rules against us, we lose the case.
that would be unfortunate.
I'm doing everything I can to exonerate you.
I had the crime scene reopened...
there was nothing there.
I've hired my own investigators.
I'm putting as much pressure on the da as I can.
I don't think so.
he's a DA.
das want to be reelected.
Yes, they do.
so cut a deal with him.
give him what he wants.
right over there, it's going to be the R&D building.
you know what that is?
Yeah. It's research and development. - There you go.
that's the brain center of any company.
hub of creation, that's where...
that's where dreams are forged into reality.
are we losing the house, dad?
Holly said she and Bethie are moving out to Aspen.
well, whatever happens,
you're going to be living with your mom in San Diego.
well, why can't I stay here with you?
I've got a lot on my plate right now.
so what, I just have to pick up and just move across the country?
Hey, you know something?
you need to grow up.
I'm dealing with some... Hey, listen to me.
I'm dealing with some major shit here.
I'm a guy who always lands on his feet.
but right now, I need to focus on making things right.
you understand that?
No...Yeah. Whatever.
Hey, come here. Come here, come here.
I did something stupid, Owen.
I made A... BIG mistake.
I'm going to be paying for the rest of my life.
what mistake?
I trusted too many people.
all right.
what's it going to take?
what's what going to take?
for you to drop these preposterous charges against Ellen Parsons.
you didn't find any new evidence.
let's cut the bullshit and talk business.
you're a free woman.
you struck a deal?
the DA dropped the charges.
the investigation's been reopened.
they'll be a press conference later today.
you can go to David's funeral now.
thank you.
you're welcome.
now where's the tape?
I don't have it.
you told me you did.
I told you it was safe.
you got five minutes. - Thank you.
good evening.
got have a few minutes?
in 2002...
I met Ray Fiske.
I didn't know this at the time, but he was Arthur Frobisher's lawyer.
shortly after, Mr. Fiske sent me down to Florida to help set up a meeting.
I didn't know what this meeting was about,
but I know that Arthur Frobisher was in contact with a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
the name of that member is...
that's going to get you quite a few years in the federal penitentiary.
tell me what you want.
well, we have a couple of options.
what are they?
if I turn this over to the U.S. Attorney's office,
you either plead guilty or you fight it in court.
either way, you lose years of your life,
and I'm still waiting in the wings to bleed you dry in a civil trial.
and the other option?
we settle.
at my price.
the videotape?
it goes away forever.
you'll sign a nondisclosure agreement?
all the evidence i have against you will never come to light.
so think about it.
but not for too long.
if I don't hear from you by the end of the day tomorrow,
I'm going to treat some friends of mine at the justice department to dinner and a movie.
boy, you really enjoy this, don't you?
it's my job.
why do you hate me so much?
someone was attacked in our home. You haven't said a word about it.
I didn't get attacked.
Ellen saw you, Michael.
you said you were going to henry's house for the weekend.
I did.
then what were you doing here?
I left my laptop, so I came back to pick it up.
why, am I a suspect?
no.
then why are you interrogating me?
we'd just like to know why you feel the need to lie.
maybe it just runs in the family.
I've gone over all of it with your money managers.
now, remember, this is just a theoretical dismantling of your asset structure.
what did they come up with?
you'd have to give up 93% of your net worth.
they'd start with your Bonds preferred stock, and then move on to real estate.
the houses?
Yes, all the houses.
fine.
liquidate all of it.
foreign holdings, domestic holdings.
I don't really care about anything else,
but I need to know that I can keep the new land that I'm developing.
Arthur, you don't have to do this.
we could still win.
can I keep the goddamn land, Marshall?
Yes.
promise me that.
we would find a way for you to keep your land.
all right.
pay her.
Arthur, this is ludicrous.
let's just cool down and think this through.
I have thought it through, Marshall, and it's my call.
pay her.
what about our motion for summary judgment?
a settlement like you're talking about, we have nothing to lose.
I have everything to lose, Marshall.
that number is astronomical.
even if we lose at trial, you may never have to pay a figure so high.
I'll give a jury a dozen reasons to award your employees less than that.
I will build all this back up again, believe me.
but right now, I'm done with this.
I need to move on.
miss Hewes, Marshall Phillips is here to see you.
thank you, betty. Send him in.
Marshall. This is a surprise.
Oh, I doubt that.
please.
can you believe it's almost fall?
we're dropping our motion for summary judgment.
my client has instructed me to extend to you this settlement offer.
there's a condition.
he wants a nondisclosure agreement.
all evidence sealed.
nothing comes out.
whatever you've got is buried.
otherwise, the offer evaporates.
understood.
tell him we accept.
you knew my father, didn't you?
I never liked him.
Oh, he never liked you.
he always thought your cases had a stink to them.
good to see you, Marshall.
together, we hit a few bumps along the way,
but in the end you believed in me and in our justice system.
your trust won this case.
Cheers!
there's a psychiatrist there.
why'd you come in this room? - Larry?
do you have a moment? - The light was on.
don't sit, Larry. This won't take long.
what's going on?
we know you were leaking information to Frobisher.
we want you to disclaim your interest in the settlement, voluntarily.
and cut myself out of two billion?
you gotta be kidding me.
if you don't remove yourself,
we'll turn you over to the U.S. Attorney's office.
it's your choice.
but I made amends.
they've made their decision, Larry.
Hey, I'm 70 years old.
I lost everything.
the man came to me. What was I supposed to do, huh?
what am I gonna do now?
before you go?
if you'll excuse me? - Sure.
your first victory as an attorney.
have you given any thought to what you're going to do next?
I don't much care at the moment.
your office is still empty.
I'm sure someone will make good use of it.
the job is yours, Ellen.
anytime you're ready.
thanks for the drink.
Mr. Nye.
get in the car.
they know what you did, Ellen.
who are you?
I'm agent harrison. This is agent .
we're with the FBI.
miss parsons, the night of ray Fiske's suicide,
you were seen leaving Hewes & Associates.
I worked there.
you were fired at the time.
what is this about?
it's about Patricia Hewes.
and the Frobisher case?
no, we were investigating Ms. Hewes long before the Frobisher case.
I tried to warn you, Ellen.
you talk to us, maybe we overlook what you were doing there that night.
this is your leverage?
you're gonna have to do better than that, this picture means nothing.
you don't want us pursuing it.
go ahead.
thanks for the chat.
we commend our brother, David Connor, unto you, lord, now that he has passed from this life.
may he live on in your presence.
eternal rest grant unto him, o lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon him.
may he rest in peace.
may his soul, and the souls of the faithful departed,
through the mercy of god, rest in peace. Amen.
Amen.
I'm trying to forgive you.
you don't have to.
it's my fault.
no.
this whole thing started because I took Frobisher's money.
the last time...
the last time I saw David...
we had a fight.
and he was right.
he was right about everything.
thank you for...
thank you for letting me come today.
david would have wanted you here.
I know you're not the enemy in all of this.
thank you.
call me when you get back to New York.
okay, let me know.
we're square.
indeed, we are.
you didn't get this from me.
you sound like my college girlfriend.
sit on it till the next election.
when it comes out, there'll be a lot more lawsuits.
shareholders are going to go after the rest of Frobisher's fortune.
and you can send him to jail.
Hey!
I've been in touch with the DA's office every day.
and what have they found?
well, they've turned the crime scene inside out, but...
even if they find the guys who did this...
they'll never trace them back to Frobisher?
I'm sorry.
so, Patty tells me that you're not coming back to work.
so you're in the loop again.
now that you're partner, you must have got a nice chunk of change from that settlement.
Yeah. Yeah.
so...
what did, what did you and patty do to win this thing?
enjoy your money, Tom.
there's a lot of great charities out there.
Hey, can I ask you something?
sure.
when Patty went away, did she ever tell you where she went?
no.
told me she was visiting family.
2 WEEKS EARLIER
you, uh, had a little girl.
she died before delivery.
may I ask...
is there a name you'd like on the certificate?
you wanted to speak with me?
the other night at my apartment...
you asked me if I regret what we did.
I want you to know...
that I do.
I deeply regret it.
why are you telling me this now?
because you're right.
I've lied.
I hired you to get to Katie. I've...
manipulated you.
I am ashamed of what I did.
I hope you can forgive me.
someday.
I have...
a lot of flaws.
come back, Ellen.
give me a second chance.
I was thinking of going away for a while.
without David, I...
I don't have a reason to be anywhere.
I understand.
I don't believe in the law anymore.
but I believe in justice.
so I'll come work for you again.
on one condition.
what's that?
let me use the firm's resources to prove that Frobisher had David killed.
it's a deal.
thank you.
you're welcome.
thanks for the chat.
what are you looking at her for?
fraud, conspiracy, obstruction of justice.
now, Mr. Nye tells us you might have reasons of your own for wanting to take down Ms. Hewes.
Yes.
I do.
do you regret what we did?
because I do.
you do?
while I'm gone, you're welcome to stay here.
it's done.
she tried to kill me.
how do you know that?
because I know Patty.
see you on monday.
you want me to go back and work for her?
ms. Parsons, you'll be working for us.
see you monday.
Patty's talked a lot about her son, but she's never once mentioned who his father is.
so, you think he's Purcell's kid?
I always wanted a son.
I just didn't know I actually had one.
you were found with your wife's body.
there's no sign of forced entry.
her ring.
she's not wearing it.
you find that ring, and you find my wife's killer.
I have no idea whether Daniel killed his wife, but his consulting firm has worked for UNR for more than a decade.
whatever you dragged our company into, it better not involve anything other than retrieving stolen documents.
this company is killing people, and that's the guy who calls the shots.
Walter Kendrick, CEO.
unr is making record profits using toxic chemicals.
there's a reporter you need to meet.
do you mind me asking where you get your water?
do you think it's contaminated from the coal plant?
Ultima National is bulletproof.
represent me, and I'll tell you everything.
I'll be right there.
please, Daniel.
almost finished.
you're missing all the fun.
Daniel, come play with me.
please, Danny?
Danny, come play with me.
I can't get it out.
please, Danny. -Christine!
you're missing all the fun.
Danny, please. Daniel... Daniel!
you're missing all the fun. -Christine!
Purcell, let's go.
Daniel Purcell told me about a reporter in West Virginia.
now that he's in jail, he's suddenly cooperating?
Yeah, being framed for his wife's murder changed his mind.
what's the reporter's name?
this is what I have on him.
he thinks that Ultima National Resources is poisoning people with Aracite.
unfortunately, we can't find him.
you think Ultima National got to him?
I don't know...
but Tom's arranging for travel down to West Virginia.
you both leave for the airport in an hour.
Patty, we still haven't proven that UNR killed Purcell's wife.
I'd rather stay here and work on that.
if we're going after Ultima National, we need Josh Reston.
you and Tom are going to find him.
I'll pack a bag.
and Ellen...
the next time I give you an assignment, just nod your head and get it done.
5 months later
come in.
have a seat.
is that the money?
are you sure you're okay? You seem a little worried.
and I have three neighbors who heard your client loud and clear.
but Mr. Purcell's neighbors weren't aware of the context of his remarks.
you mean your client yelling, "I'll kill you,
at 2: 00 a. m. a week before his wife was murdered?
it's not my job to decide context.
that's for a jury.
he was threatening an intruder.
Daniel Purcell did not kill his wife.
you also have the police report he filed that night?
I do, as well as the restraining order the victim filed against your client for physical abuse.
the district attorney's office is building a strong case.
if you're angling for a plea, now is the time.
I'm not.
there's exculpatory evidence that is being ignored.
you mean the diamond ring that wasn't stolen?
Oh, no, you must mean the ruby ring that only Mr. Purcell seems to know about.
this doesn't have to be adversarial.
in fact, some of my best friends are plaintiffs' attorneys.
I have plenty of friends.
find the ring.
and if you don't, I will.
my boss is giving five grand to anyone who finds this.
photo's from an insurance appraisal.
the ring could have been fenced, or it could have been sold to the usual spots.
use your contacts, but don't run your mouths.
you find it, you tell me and me only.
Hey, sweetheart.
come here. Come here, honey.
this all you got for that ring?
that's it.
$300? -I swear. That's all I got.
you're a goddamned liar, Kevin.
you swore to me $450.
I owe $480, and that's not even all the doctor bills.
you got to be patient, Liza. There's more coming.
I promise you.
I've been patient, Kevin!
always the same shit with you.
I've been thinking about you every minute of every day.
Hey, Patty.
dad, are you ever gonna come home?
Erica, the police made a very bad mistake when they arrested your father.
I am doing everything I can to make sure he comes home to you.
okay.
are there any leads on the stolen ring?
no.
still looking.
but, Daniel, if you're right and they're using Aracite down in West Virginia, there is a case to try against Ultima National.
made contact with that journalist?
no, he won't answer our phone calls.
he's a kid.
he's scared.
well, he has a reason to be.
unr has everything to lose.
he's the one who knows what's going on down there.
you got to find him.
my people are on their way down to West Virginia as we speak.
awesome, there's 17 stations of bluegrass.
that's not, uh, bluegrass, actually.
that's, uh, old-time country.
Oh, please.
what? There is a...
there's a difference.
old-time country, the background instruments, you know, accompany the melody.
Really? -And in bluegrass, each instrument takes its turn playing the melody and improvising off it.
I'm just trying to educate you. -You're...fascinating.
thank you.
you are a fascinating man.
it's true.
there's a difference.
you know, I'm...
I'm totally lost.
I have no idea where this motel is at all.
this map is...rediculous.
do you see that?
Jesus.
what is that smell?
what the hell is going on down here?
goddamn, that's just about long enough to measure my manhood.
took the family to Scotland last year.
played Carnoustie.
brutal course.
the Scots invented the game of golf, you know.
Yeah, some hunchback prick in a kilt hit a rock with a stick.
now it's a $40 billion business.
how we doing, Donny?
this can't be good.
that kid we found on the property a few days back?
turns out he's a local reporter.
does the name Joshua Reston mean anything to you, Mr. Suttry?
should it?
well, apparently the kid's been in phone contact with one of your employees.
who's that?
Purcell is under control.
good, 'cause we've got another problem.
we were reviewing surveillance footage of the north compound.
seems like the reporter took a water sample.
runoff from the Building 3 processor.
what should I do about the sample?
Mr. Kendrick?
get it back.
Patty, we found the ring, and I think we got a lead on the guy who pawned it.
can you get it to me in an hour?
Yeah, okay.
you want me to bring it by the office?
Yeah.
Mr. Reston?
you home?
anything?
no, they're saying the phone's off the hook.
looks like someone got to him before us.
Mr. Purcell told you the ring was stolen from the crime scene.
we bought it from the owner of the pawn shop.
that picture was taken by his security camera.
that's the man who killed Christine Purcell.
just because a blond guy pawns her ring doesn't necessarily mean he killed her.
you really want to bring that argument into court?
I'll look into this.
you know, I've been doing this for 26 years, and... I want to believe Mr. Purcell.
but I just can't.
how you doing, Kevin?
I've been better.
ain't we all?
how's that pretty little girl of yours?
what the hell? -Open the register.
how much you need? -All of it!
I'd say it's just a...
a basic fear of mortality.
Really?
totally.
in your dream, it's a black-tie event, and you show up wearing a white suit?
right.
face it, Phil.
that's got fear of death written all over it.
or maybe I'm just trying to inject a little whimsy into the proceedings.
maybe not.
or maybe I'm going to dazzle the crowd with my John Travolta impression.
InPulp Fictionhe wore black.
Yes, but inSaturday Night Fever...
never saw it.
10 years eariler
you filed for custody?
you can't ask me to ignore my son.
I explained to you why he's not ready for this.
all I want to do is see him, and I'm tired of asking.
so you're taking legal action?
is there anything else you understand?
you don't want to pursue this in court.
why not?
because I'll destroy you.
well, things are looking good.
they found Christine's ring.
I need an attorney to redraft my will, get my estate in order.
I'm going to get you out of here.
Christine refused to talk about the future.
she denied its existence.
it was fear.
she shut down after she saw what her father went through.
I'll get you an estate attorney.
Erica was the first baby I ever held.
I was always uncomfortable with everybody else's.
and then Christine put my baby girl in my arms, and I felt it instantly.
I would die for her.
you listen to me, all right?
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Thanks, Chuck.
we were hoping you could tell us where we might be able to find Josh Reston.
is he still one of your reporters?
I sent him to cover a Mountaineer game in Morgantown.
woman's basketball.
they're squaring off against Fairfield.
should be one heck of a contest.
we've been calling his cell phone for three days.
he's not answering.
I don't know why that would be.
well, maybe you can help us with something else.
shoot.
Josh was researching livestock mortality rates.
Yes, he was.
you're the editor of the paper.
why haven't you published any of those articles?
Josh was trying to connect Ultima National's coal processing with farms being wiped out.
I just didn't think he had the research to back that up.
Mr. Donohue, we went to Josh's place.
it was ransacked.
someone must think that he's on the right track.
I- I don't know anything about that.
and I don't believe you that he's at a basketball game.
I'm sorry.
Josh is a smart kid and he tries hard, but he is dead wrong about this one.
you two be careful down here.
detective!
you're not going to believe this.
I think this is the guy you're looking for.
picked up for armed robbery?
robbed his own cousin, and get this:
he had a pawn ticket on him.
I know you're drinking light these days.
Thanks, Chuck.
I heard you got some news for me.
Yeah, there were a couple of suits in here from New York.
they were talking to Lester Donohue, asking questions about that reporter.
you catch their names?
no, but I asked around and, they're staying at the Green Inn.
just thought Mr. Kendrick should know.
no, come on, man, you know beer's on the house.
no, that's not for the drink, Chuck.
you're a good man.
um... we found the guy.
how?
he was, uh, picked up for armed robbery and, uh, he had a pawn ticket on him.
his name is Kevin Walker.
does he match Mr. Purcell's description?
Yes.
I know.
I was wrong.
um... that's why I came in person.
well, I can respect that, Detective.
we'll want a lineup.
I'll arrange it.
good.
can I see number four in profile?
his right side? -Certainly.
I saw him in profile as he went by me.
number four, step forward.
turn left.
no.
no, that's not him.
step back. Thank you.
number five.
number five, step forward.
turn left.
do you recognize him?
Mr. Purcell?
that's him.
that's... that's the guy.
what's for dinner?
a cider-braised pork shoulder.
tell me how a gal like you doesn't have a husband.
uh, maybe because I don't want one.
I assume you've been following the situation on Daniel Purcell.
the asshole leaks our Aracite documents, then turns around and kills his wife.
no, Mr. Purcell was released from jail.
and I think Wayne Suttry had something to do with the murder.
that's quite an accusation.
you can back this up?
no.
but my legal advice is to eliminate exposure.
I want you to cut ]all ties with Suttry.
okay.
and I have to ask.
did we have anything to do with the murder?
come on, Claire.
absolutely not.
you said you had news.
I do, Mr. Suttry.
our guy's been arrested.
is Purcell still in jail?
no, he's been released.
stop staring.
you're making her nervous.
do you have instructions for me?
I respond... to instructions.
drive out to Attica.
Mr. Kendrick wants you to thank Mr. Walker.
keep me posted.
there's definitely a case down here, Patty.
everything's consistent with Purcell's story.
the only problem is, still can't find the kid.
so just give us a call when you can.
Hey!
Mr. Pibb.
I'll see you in the morning.
Ah, shit.
they're out of Mr. Pibb!
I heard you were looking for me.
can we talk somewhere safe?
so after you spoke to my editor, he looked into your firm.
found out you were representing Daniel Purcell.
how did you contact Purcell?
about a month ago, he sent me a fax after he read one of my obituaries.
an obituary?
Yeah. One of the county's largest hog farmers hanged himself after his whole stock got wiped out.
Mr. Purcell thought he knew what was killing the animals.
when we first got here, there were fires alongside the road.
and there was a... there was a smell.
Yeah, that's the, uh, dead livestock.
they burn them at night.
draw a circle around the county, and every quarter mile closer you get to Ultima's facilities, there's a 30% increase in livestock fatalities.
can you prove that?
Yeah, I've got the research.
but it's not only affecting livestock.
leukemia rates around here are 145% above the national average.
and anyone who speaks out against them...
anyone who speaks out against them gets silenced.
that's why we're down here.
we want to bring a suit against UNR.
do you know anyone who'd be willing to serve as a plaintiff?
no. No.
but if somebody steps forward, they're going to need protection.
well, we can provide that.
we can provide it for you, too.
I'm fine.
we stopped by your house.
it was trashed pretty good.
Yeah, I saw them pulling up.
I ran out the back, but I don't think they were coming for me.
what do you mean?
well, last week, I snuck onto the company's property, took a couple pictures.
a couple of the workers knocked me around and stole my camera.
but there's something they didn't take.
what is that?
we're going to want to get this to our boss back in New York.
you'll have 5 minutes.
you got something for me?
a job.
what is it?
it's simple.
I want you to deliver a message.
Hey.
what are you working on?
rewriting my college essay.
how's that going?
fine.
let me know if you want another set of eyes.
Thanks.
Phil already offered.
Michael, I'd like to talk to you about something.
did your associates ever find the reporter?
Yeah.
and he has a water sample from UNR property.
if that tests positive for Aracite, that could change the whole game.
will you test it?
Yes. Absolutely.
I've already filed a complaint with the court.
our next step is a motion to expedite discovery.
okay.
now, in order for us to win that motion, we'll need you to testify that Aracite is toxic, and that UNR knowingly ignored your warnings.
these people killed my wife, Patty.
I'll do whatever you need me to.
Daniel, this might not be the right time, but there may never be the "right" time.
I've... I've talked it over with my husband and...
we decided that it was best for us to tell Michael about you.
he knows everything.
and if it's, if it's all right with you, he'd like to meet you.
thank you, Patty.
I'd like that very much.
a little weird.
it's like I always.
I believe Daniel Purcell's wife may have been murdered to protect the secrets of a major energy corporation.
Kevin Walker was identified in a lineup, and then he confessed to the murder.
Yes, but look at his record.
he had four priors. -Misdemeanors.
all for heroin possession.
murder is way out of his league.
your client's a free man, Ms. Hewes.
go home. Be happy.
all I'm saying-- if Kevin Walker murdered Christine Purcell, he didn't act alone.
there's something much bigger going on here.
Kevin Walker?
Yeah, yeah.
I talked to your guy, man.
has my family been taken care of?
Yeah, they're doing great, man.
brand new condo in Yonkers, bro.
thank you. Thank you.
thank you.
sorry, man.
I got a family, too, you know.
this is them.
what's going on now?
this is the road to the airport.
you headed out of town?
just going for a drive, sir.
can you open up the back for me, please?
why would I want to do that?
we have reason to believe you're in possession of stolen property.
Really?
step out of the car, please, sir.
step aside, please.
you know you can't do this.
do what?
illegal search and seizure.
we know you two are in possession of stolen property.
now where's the goddamn water?
what's the problem, Officer?
Hey.
Where's Tom?
we split up.
he's still down there looking for a plaintiff.
did you get a sample?
Yeah.
nice work.
whatever Ultima National is dumping in that water
entire farms are being wiped out.
people are getting sick now, too.
well, Daniel's agreed to analyze this and to testify against UNR.
I've scheduled a hearing.
what about his original report?
won't UNR argue that he leaked confidential information?
Yes, but Daniel's willing to go on record that
Ultima National doctored his report and committed fraud.
as soon as he does, we can file a class action against them.
contrary to Ms. Maddox' claims, Your Honor, we are not blindly casting a net.
we're requesting these specific files.
this toxicity report exists and it's damning.
the only reason Ms. Hewes is even aware of these confidential files, Your Honor, is because she represented a high-ranking employee of ours in a criminal matter.
this, uh, Daniel Purcell.
Yes.
Mr. Purcell shared proprietary information with Ms. Hewes.
now there's a clear ethical conflict.
Mr. Purcell was being threatened, Your Honor.
as such, he was forced to share his work in an effort to protect himself against the company.
well, in order to establish Mr. Purcell's state of mind,
I would like to hear directly from him.
thank you.
please state your name for the court, sir.
please raise your right hand.
do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
ms. Hewes, your witness.
thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Purcell, could you please explain to the court why you thought it necessary to divulge the proprietary information in question?
are you aware of any fraudulent activity being conducted on behalf of Ultima National Resources?
objection. Leading.
sustained.
ms. Hewes, you know better than that.
did Ultima National Resources doctor the results of a scientific study that you yourself had conducted?
objection.
overruled. I'll allow it.
you can answer the question.
unr doctored nothing.
their results are clean.
the information that I shared with Ms. Hewes in confidence was in reference to an entirely unrelated matter.
I subsequently discovered that my documents were not accurate, and I never intended for them to be used against Ultima National Resources.
your Honor, I move that Ms. Hewes' motion be denied.
your Honor...
I-I'm sorry, Ms. Hewes, but there's no factual basis for your motion.
I would like a short recess to speak to the witness about his state of mind.
his state of mind seems perfectly clear to me.
in the future, Ms. Hewes, exercise greater discretion
motion denied.
thank you, Your Honor.
what are you doing here?
just a friendly "thank you.
Hey, look. I know this has been tough on you.
get off my land.
you want to be alone.
I understand.
Mr. Kendrick just wanted you to know that the first wire transfer went through.
you and Erica...
have been provided for.
you've been reasonable.
and so will we.
I said leave.
3 weeks eariler
we're good.
how you doing?
who the hell is this?
my name is Kevin.
shut up. He doesn't want to know your name.
this ring was on your wife's right hand.
I want you to take it,
I want you to wait a couple of days, pawn it, then keep the ticket.
pawn it where? - Anywhere.
and all you have to do is take a good look at him.
everything's going to be okay, Mr. Purcell.
just go into the house and call 911.
I believe daniel purcell's wife may have been murdered to protect the secrets of a major energy corporation.
Ultima national resources is destroying the environment, and that's the guy who calls the shots.
Walter kendrick, ceo.
we'll need you to testify that aracite is toxic and that unr ignores your warnings.
I'll do whatever you need me to.
unr doctored nothing.
their results are clean.
motion denied.
you think ultima national got to him?
Mr. Kendrick just wanted you to know that the first wire transfer went through.
I'm agent harrison, this is agent werner. We're with the fbi.
the bureau's putting together a case we want patty to take.
we'll use you to monitor it from the inside.
don't take the infant mortality case.
you were the one who brought in that case, weren't you?
Ellen, have you had any dreams this week?
I can't sleep.
her fianc? was murdered a month ago. How is she supposed to sleep?
this is detective rick messer. He asked if he could take a look around.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
what about david connor?
do I have to worry about him? - No.
Arthur frobisher had your fianc? killed, didn't he?
thanks for inviting me, patty.
I've been worried about you. - Worried?
when daniel purcell flipped on the stand, he humiliated you in open court.
Daniel purcell is in the past.
come on, patty. Don't tell me you're not angry.
I ever tell you how i choose a case?
no.
I used to not understand it.
you know, why some cases grabbed me and others didn't?
then I realized...
it starts with a seed of anger.
I can feel it in my hands and my chest, and that seed has to be nurtured, cultivated until it grows into a full-blown rage.
then I know that I can't turn back.
I have no choice but to take the case because the rage doesn't abate.
until someone's punished.
do you feel that, too?
I've begun to recently. Thank you.
Purcell may have betrayed me, but he's just a pawn.
this is all about ultima national resources.
we're going after them, and if daniel purcell is a casualty, so be it.
I'll do what I can, mr. Purcell, but it's really not a seller's market right now.
I don't care about the price. Just get rid of it.
okay.
the sooner the better.
I understand. I'm sorry about your wife.
you have to make a decision, daniel. - I know.
5 WEEKS EARLIER
if that company is making people sick, you have to stop them.
because I'm not going to blow the whistle.
what?
I made a deal.
with unr?
they're going to leave us alone now.
you gave in to them.
I had no choice.
if you don't stop them, I will.
my true motivation in aligning these two companies is the golden opportunity to merge corporate philosophies.
this goes way beyond tax incentives, way beyond the marketization of capital.
the synergy that...
that's why kendrick was so desperate to cover up the aracite contamination.
a massive class action suit would have killed his merger.
so what can we do? Without daniel purcell as a witness, it's impossible to bring a lawsuit against unr.
and if this merger goes through, they'll have twice the resources to fight us.
unless, of course, we can stop the merger.
that's what we're going to try to do.
get me a complete legal and financial history of unr.
right, yep, I'm on it.
um, did you invite her?
invite me where?
uh, patty will tell you.
Tom's been with the firm ten years this week.
Oh, great. I had no idea.
I'm hosting a small get-together at my place to celebrate.
I'd love to have you come.
I know you haven't been back to my apartment since...
so if you don't feel comfortable joining us, I understand.
thank you.
this isn't a work obligation. It's just a friendly invitation.
whatever you decide.
as representative of the energy commission, I have serious concerns about this merger.
you wouldn't be doing your job if you didn'T.
specifically on the environmental front.
well, we fully intend on easing your worries, mr. Schiff.
that's why I've brought mr. Purcell here today.
Daniel is vice president and head of research.
they do independent scientific analysis.
we were contracted to analyze risk and environmental sensitivity at all unr operating sites nationwide.
and what did your firm find?
our results are published in this report, but the upshot is that unr complies with every standard set forth
I look forward to reading that through.
in your opinion, mr. Purcell, if our commission were to ratify the proposed merger, do you have any concerns with regards to the safety of future unr joint operations?
none.
environmental protection policies are built into unr's operations at every existing site, both onshore and off.
they pose absolutely no risk to the environment.
sure you don't want anything?
Yeah, we're good.
so, what's your feeling on this dinner party?
I never want to go back to that apartment again.
if it's not now, you'll have to go some other time.
Yeah. I get that.
but it's your decision.
if you're not ready, we understand.
if you do go, we want you to record it.
Mr. Schiff is ready.
thank you.
Doug. - Come on in.
good to see you. - You, too.
these are serious allegations.
it's an environmental nightmare.
I wouldn't waste your time, doug.
who else knows?
no one has this information but me.
and what do you aim to do?
kill the merger.
but the state supreme court will never take a stand against walter kendrick.
he has west virginia wrapped around his little finger.
Yeah, I see that.
your commission may be the only thing that can stop him.
nothing can happen without the approval of this office.
Patty, what I'm reading is speculative. It may not be enough.
at least you could stall him.
buy me time to find more.
my office needs to issue a ruling by the end of next week.
that's all the time I need.
tremendous view.
so this federal regulator...
Douglas schiff. - Yeah.
he's stalling. It's pissing me off.
I've explored that situation.
and where are we?
what do you mean, "no"? There has to be a way in.
schiff has no extracurriculars.
he's clean?
spotless.
I could always get creative.
no. Don'T.
this is a deputy director of a federal agency.
there's too much attention as it is.
do you have more instructions?
no, you can go.
but keep in touch.
we're here tonight to honor walter kendrick.
he was recently voted club president.
it's a night of grand tradition.
and I know it's just a ritual, but I gotta tell you
Walt, you wear a skirt better than any president we've had - since your grandfather shep kendrick. - All right.
course, he turned out to be a fag.
you'd like a little of this wouldn't you, hank?
as many of you know, walt, was born in the great state of west virginia.
his roots are there.
Oh, yeah, he loves the place.
he did, however, break with tradition by not marrying one of his cousins.
apparently, they all had too many teeth.
seriously though, I always wondered why birds flew over the state of west virginia upside down.
and then I met this guy-- and i realized there is nothing there worth shitting on.
looking out over the crowd, i can see that, uh, walt's favorite attorney, claire maddox, is not in attendance.
any of you folks know claire maddox?
Yeah.
that lady gets around.
I'm not saying I don't want to throw a hump into her, but i have a feeling it'd be like tossing a hotdog down a hallway.
great stuff in there. - Yeah?
well, I was warned to tone it down, but I figured, you know, it's tradition, right?
it's nothing personal. You gotta be able to swallow it.
you're a terrific sport, mr. Kendrick.
I agree. It wasn't funny.
I was told you have a little merger problem.
I think patty hewes leaked information to some asshole on the regulatory commission.
how can I help?
Ellen. Good to see you.
come on in, make yourself at home. - Thank you.
you remember, deb. Right?
nice to see you again. - You, too.
Oh, congratulations. How far along are you?
about four-and-a-half months.
that's great.
and congratulations to you-- ten years.
it's amazing that you survived.
it's only because of this one right here.
Oh, excuse me.
Patty asked me to organize the speeches.
nothing fancy. You'll say a few words after dinner.
I... I haven't, uh, prepared anything.
just kidding, ellen.
you know the woman hates speeches.
everything all right?
Yeah. Just fine.
Cheers.
Cheers.
how'd I do?
I didn't hit him once?
if nothing else, I'm sure you scared him.
how is that even possible?
it takes time.
besides, look at his face, he's terrified.
no way he didn't shit himself.
shut up. Send him back.
I'm not leaving until I cap this asshole. Come on.
so why the interest in firearms?
I never told you, but, uh, someone tried to kill me the night my fianc? was murdered.
Frobisher's people? - No.
who, then? - I don't know.
but, uh, I won't ever feel that vulnerable again.
Yeah, of course.
so, thanks for the lesson.
Yeah. Same time next week, then?
Yeah. I'm gonna put a hole in that thing if it kills me.
I'll see you, wes.
suddenly she wants to learn how to use a gun.
I don't know if you're safe.
5 MONTHS LATER
I told you, you can't be here today.
Oh, I'm sorry. I just, um...
what's wrong?
I just had to see you.
are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.
I think the rate of return against the yen is grossly undervalued.
clearly, there's a window of opportunity about to open there.
well, let's stay on top of it. I don't want to miss out.
you got it.
I've only got a minute.
how's life in the private sector?
excellent. I've been down in bogota the past couple of months.
I didn't know you were heading that up. Good for you.
Yeah, thanks. But, phil, that's not why I'm here.
you didn't hear this from me.
I caught wind of something you should know.
okay.
it's about your wife.
you're home late.
Yeah, I was researching ultima national's legal history.
we need to talk.
what? Is it michael?
no, no. Somebody came to me.
he's connected, and he's heard rumblings.
what rumblings?
apparently, there are forces in the business world that would love to put you out of business.
that's not news.
no, but it's an understatement to say that there are ceo's who don't like you, and they're using their influence in washington against you.
are you saying I'm under investigation?
I don't know.
but I doubt he'd talk to me if you weren'T.
I don't know what you've done. I don't need to know.
but you have to be sure there's nothing out there that they can hang you with.
you have nothing to worry about.
scrutiny won't be an issue.
how can you be sure?
because I don't leave loose ends.
I've never left you vulnerable.
from day one, you've been insulated.
I'm talking about loose ends that could go all the way back to the old firm.
if I'm under investigation, god knows what they'll try to use to hurt me.
I've said it before-- the only thing that can hurt you is ellen parsons.
she brought in the infant mortality case, don't forget.
I haven'T.
you almost took that case. - I know.
could have been a setup.
ask yourself, after everything that happened to her, why did she come back to work?
something's been bothering me.
yeah?
that infant mortality case.
I've been thinking about the plaintiff that wanted to pay off.
what was her name?
Monique bryant. - Bryant, right.
how did you find her?
um, someone in grief counseling referred her to me.
who?
they're adamant about privacy. I... I can't give any names.
right. I'm sorry. Of course. I...
I'm just concerned that someone was trying to set you up.
why would anyone want to do that?
I don't know.
I just...
something about that case never felt right.
it was wonderful having you at dinner the other night. I hope you had fun.
I had a lovely time.
Patty's getting nervous.
Yeah, it's about the girl. We need to take action.
so nothing useful came out at the dinner party.
but patty's acting strange. - How so?
she seems paranoid.
let's take a walk. Is that your wife?
sorry.
you off to london? - Yeah. Just till friday.
I'll be back for the weekend.
could you do me a favor?
sure. What's that?
could you look this over? - What is it?
it's an unr financial report. I'd really like your take on it.
all right, I'll do my best. - Thanks.
brunch on saturday? - Of course.
Bye, babe. - Bye.
we've got less than a week.
our scope needs to be more comprehensive.
Doug schiff is on our side, but we need to convince his commission that this merger should not go through.
Craig, ari, I want to know more about unr's environmental record.
look into every state that they've where they've done business for the last 20 years.
OK.
Ellen, in my office.
shut the door.
what do you think you're doing?
about what? - In there.
you see anyone else checking their phone while I'm talking?
no. I apologize. - Don'T.
just tell me the truth.
what do you have in your life that's more important than work?
nothing. I'm sorry, patty.
I'm not asking you to be sorry.
I'm asking you who called.
I was late for a meeting. - What meeting?
counseling.
I thought you stopped going. - To group.
I'm going one-on-one, twice a week, during lunch.
you're excused, then.
leave.
amazing.
what's amazing, babe?
this ultima national merger.
you have a position in it?
this is for patty?
she's circling a case.
you want to run it by me? - Do you mind?
not at all.
look at these numbers.
tell me if you see what I see.
later. We've only got one item in london.
I thought you were phil.
he went out of town, remember?
where? - London.
London. Again?
then he's meeting me in amherst to look at colleges.
how are your applications going?
did you show phil your essay?
no.
why not?
it's about daniel purcell.
why did you do that?
it's supposed to be a personal essay.
he's my father.
what's more personal than that?
I don't want you having anything to do with him anymore , michael.
for 17 years, you hide him from me.
then one day, it's all reunions and smiles.
and now you don't want me to see him?
he betrayed you, mom. You're human. Get over it.
I've looked into this thing, patty, and I'm ready to run and gun.
consider the merger dead.
well... well, you're welcome.
this is an opportunity to do some important work.
Hey, it's me. Meet me at the hotel.
I got a joke for you.
why do birds fly upside down over the state of west virginia?
do they?
well, now you ruined it.
what's this about, mr. Pell?
your career.
I think I'm being followed.
how do you know?
the other day, i noticed this guy when I met with you, and then I just saw him again today.
it can't be a coincidence.
you're sure it was the same guy?
positive.
we're going to want a written description.
what?
Patty asked me about the infant mortality case again.
I'm afraid that she'S... on to me somehow.
Ellen, if you've been made, we can't continue.
let me just work her a little more, okay? Find out for sure.
no. Don't have any contact with her.
we have to take this to our supervisor. - Why?
because there's a very good chance this operation is over.
your girl gets around.
what do you think? - Could be lawyers.
look like feds to me.
why the hell did ferc authorize the merger?
believe me, I went went beyond due diligence here.
I climbed way out on a limb. - And?
and even if we could prove that unr was dumping contaminants-- which we can't
we still have no proof of any fraudulent activity.
bullshit!
there are impact studies from an independent consulting firm that back up their claim.
Doug, this is me you're talking to.
you know that report is a lie!
there's no evidence, patty.
I feel terrible about this, but truly, my hands are tied.
well, I have good news.
the merger's going through.
Congratulations.
congratulations to you, too.
I invited you here, dan, because loyalty goes a long way with me.
I see big things in your future.
my future doesn't particularly concern me, but...
my daughter's does.
look at me.
look at me.
your concerns are my concerns.
you have my word.
you're going to clean up the mess down in west virginia?
everything I heard about you is true.
you guaranteed me, you'd stop using aracite, and you'd clean it up.
it's already happening.
I want you to come and work for us, dan.
I'd like to make you head of research.
oversee unr's move to alternative energy.
the merger's through...
that's what you wanted.
now I'm done.
I know how you feel, dan, but whatever happened that night in your house, with your wife, it's over, it's done with.
you played ball; this is a partnership now.
I checked into monique bryant, the client for the infant mortality case.
what did you find?
48 years of age, daughter died in childbirth, lost the baby, too.
so, ellen's in the clear.
well, the hospital records check out, but the plaintiff came in here was african american.
and this is the real monique bryant.
Ellen's a liability, patty.
I've said it all along.
yeah?
so, what's so important?
I know you don't trust me, and you have a very good reason not to.
what reason would that be?
I was approached by the fbi last night.
this isn't the plan.
what the hell is she doing?
what did they want?
they want to use me as an informant against you.
what's their leverage?
they have pictures of me leaving the office the night of fiske's suicide.
we never told the police that i was there.
I told them to go screw themselves.
that was ballsy.
well, it was clear nothing they had on me was going to stick.
I think you were right about the infant mortality case. It was a setup.
they're trying to catch you paying off a client.
we have to be very careful.
the problem is, the feds can approach anyone.
who else in the office is vulnerable?
good question.
Patty, we're in this together.
they take you down, I go down, too.
she just sold us out.
I decided to tell patty that I was approached by the feds.
okay, that was unbelievably stupid!
it was the only way to win her confidence.
you heard me. I protected my cover.
I told her I refused to cooperate with you guys.
did she believe you?
I think so. - You think so? That's great.
Hey, hey, relax. Ellen...
look, she doesn't trust anyone right now except for me, so if you still want to get to her, I'm your only chance.
so, how's your mother?
Oh, I haven't seen her all month.
you need some help with this?
Oh, no, pete. I got it. Thanks.
listen, patrick...
I gotta cut through the bullshit.
you have to take a vacation.
the heat is on my boss.
it's because of that girl we went after?
my boss could never know about this.
so take this. But you gotta leave tonight.
I made a deal. They're gonna leave us alone now.
if you don't stop them, I will.
no, you won'T.
I'll call the police.
I can't let you do that.
in fact, I'm gonna call the epa.
we're in trouble.
do you want my help? - Yes.
which one of these is yours?
is your daughter expected home tonight?
no, she's upstate with her grandparents.
give me the keys.
okay, go park your car.
20 minutes, this will all be over.
I looked into the unr merger. It makes no sense financially.
in what way?
it seems to me that kendrick is grossly overpaying, and he's too smart not to realize it.
what's his motive?
to consolidate power. But if you ask me, that's just his first move.
there must be something else he's getting out of it.
such as...
well, that's what you've got to figure out.
your friend was right, you know? I'm under investigation.
the feds are looking into me.
then you have to forget about this whole thing.
Patty, kendrick is too well-connected I want you to promise me that you will leave unr alone.
detective messer, are you still down there?
you got my cheeseburger?
I said extra ketchup. - It's in there.
call csu and get the M. E. Down here.
well, it's worse than you thought.
she's been meeting with someone.
looks like law enforcement. I think it's fbi.
what do you want me to do?
5 MONTHS LATER
I think it's flight number 84 out of newark.
right.
can you cancel the reservation for me?
no, that's it. Thank you.
Wes, what's going on?
they're doing some work at my building. It'S...
do you mind if I crash here tonight?
sure. - Or two?
maybe three.
let's just see how the first night goes.
I can live with that.
when daniel purcell flipped on the stand he humiliated you in open court.
this is all about ultima national resources.
if you don't stop them, I will.
do you want my help?
Yes.
whatever happened that night in your house with your wife is over.
this is a partnership now.
my legal advice is to eliminate exposure.
okay.
did you tell anyone about us?
no.
let me use the firm's resources to prove that frobisher had david killed.
this is detective rick messer. He asked if he could take a look around.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
it's my fault. - No.
I know you're not the enemy in all of this.
you're early. - I know.
come in. Want a drink?
no, I'm good.
the movie doesn't start for another hour.
Where's mark?
he's going to meet us at the theater.
I thought you and I could talk first.
sure. What's up?
what's this?
it's the security deposit from your and david's apartment.
the lease isn't up for another month.
Yeah, I know, but they said they could rent it a month early.
they said they were going to call you.
no. No one called.
I'm so sorry. I thought you knew.
my parents have packed everything up, so...
it's all ready to be moved.
I thought that I'd go back there one last time.
Ellen, don't put yourself through that.
the movers can put everything into storage.
if feels like that apartment's all that I've got left of him.
el, don't go back there.
we're back with litigator patty hewes who somehow made it past security with an axe.
and she's looking to grind it.
I've never seen you like this.
even arthur frobisher never inspired this kind of attack.
Arthur frobisher has nothing on walter kendrick.
Kendrick and his company ultima national resources have systematically ravaged the environment.
but has the company done anything illegal?
Walter kendrick is a corporate thug who's gone out of his way to shield himself from litigation.
Kendrick believes that he can get away with anything.
the tragedy is, so far he has.
I mean, have you ever heard of a toxin called aracite?
no, never.
that's because walter kendrick doesn't want you to.
he's using it in his facility in west virginia and it's poisoning people.
can you prove that?
unr did its own study and determined aracite to be safe, which is, you know, no big surprise, but a high-level consultant from an independent research firm reported otherwise, and now his wife is dead.
ms. Hewes, are you implying that walter kendrick is responsible for a murder?
implying it?
I hope that's not what this sounds like, greta.
I'm stating it outright.
Patty hewes said a few things on tv.
I heard.
you have to take it seriously, walt.
it's outrageous. She accused you of murder.
she's a madwoman.
maybe, but people listen to her. She's a virtual celebrity now.
riding high on frobisher. We cannot afford...
Arthur frobisher is a narcissistic dipshit who stumbled his way into billions.
he dumped his own stock with the whole world watching.
forget frobisher. This is about patty hewes.
we humiliated her in court.
she wants to destroy you now.
we have to shut her up.
send a cease and desist order.
Ah, it's not enough.
the stock price fell today.
I'll set up a meeting with the major shareholders-- reassure them.
regardless, we can't let patty's accusations hang out there.
I want to sue her.
for what? - Well, obviously for defamation.
we can't get involved in a lawsuit.
that's just going to keep her bullshit story alive.
what are our options?
ignore it until she goes away.
Patty's not going to go away.
she accused you of murder.
is everything taken care of?
not yet.
Jesus christ!
what do you want me to do?
okay.
I think we should sue.
but you're the boss, walt.
it's your decision.
are you positive unr is behind christine purcell's murder?
of course not. How could I be?
then why are you on national television hurling accusations at him?
to make it personal.
Oh, by the way, I want you to work up a complete background on claire maddox.
I need to know who we're dealing with here.
what do you think patty hewes is up to?
she's on the warpath.
she's beating the tom-toms.
she's furious because of what i did to her in that courtroom, and she's going to do everything she can to take it out on your company.
why didn't you ever tell me about your history with her?
it had nothing to do with us.
what else haven't you told me about, danny?
if I haven't shared things with you...
it's for your own protection.
I'm not your daughter. I don't need protection.
why don't you come out to the country this weekend?
I don't think I can.
when can I see you again?
I don't think you will see me again, danny.
I see.
it's gotten a little complicated, don't you think?
your company, my company, patty hewes, your wife.
it was a mistake getting involved with you.
then why did you come here tonight?
to tell you in person.
that was the last time.
take care.
Katie. - I'm at the police station.
what is it? - I was mugged.
can you pick me up at the 19th precinct?
I'll be right there.
I came out of the subway and I walked about a block.
which direction?
um, east, I think.
and then I took a left.
North?
right. And then he came up behind me and grabbed my bag.
all right, wait here.
I just need to get some forms for you to fill out.
Hey, are you following me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
stay away from me!
it was the same guy.
are you sure? - Look at this.
this is the man who was following me.
and this was back when frobisher wanted you to sign the confidentiality agreement.
Yes! He's a cop.
I think he saw me, ellen.
I don't know what to do.
okay, all right, just sit down, all right? Calm down.
we'll figure this out.
now, if this guy traces back to frobisher in any way, we will find him.
okay? I promise.
Yeah. Fine, pam.
I will sign the paperwork tonight.
you want to knock that off?
all right, I am hanging up. Sorry.
there's a cop I need you to look into.
Why?
he may have something to do with my fianc? s murder.
well, then... we can't help you.
our investigation is limited to patty hewes and her firm.
well, do it as a favor. I need your help.
we can'T.
you're fbi-- you can do whatever you want.
Ellen... - I'm telling you, this guy may be a killer.
and I'm telling you our hands are tied.
he's right-- we are not authorized to do that.
this is bullshit.
I don't know if you remember, but last year before katie's deposition she was being followed.
I remember.
this is the guy. He's a policeman.
he must have been working for frobisher.
no wonder they haven't gotten anywhere with david's murder.
this is my first real lead.
you told me I could use the firm to go after frobisher.
my resources are your resources.
thank you.
Katie connors saw you? - Yes.
you're sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.
what if she talks?
she can't prove anything.
but her friend, ellen parsons, has been meeting with the feds.
since when?
I'm not sure.
well, katie connor made me.
so what do we do?
you? You do nothing.
keep your mouth shut, and I'll handle the rest.
Eight-passenger seating, six-liter v-8 engine, with hybrid dual-mode transmission.
better city fuel economy than the mini cooper s convertible.
Seriously? Impressive.
does it have a navigation system?
Oh, absolutely.
it's dvd-based, with turn-by-turn directions.
I'll take it.
do you want to, uh, take a test drive?
I said I'll take it.
great. Uh, let me find my manager-- we can talk finance.
we don't need any of that. I'll pay cash. Sticker price.
car practically sells itself.
what do you mean, the unr merger doesn't make sense?
it's bad business.
Kendrick overpaid to acquire that company.
why would the unr board let him do that?
because kendrick makes money.
every gamble he's ever taken has paid off.
well, if he overpaid he must have a way to make that money back.
Yeah.
we have to find out what that is.
you aren't concerned about the feds looking into you?
we'll just...
watch our step and keep our eyes open.
you know what I'm in the mood for?
what's that?
a fight.
the merger's gone through.
are you ready on your end?
Yeah. Let's get going.
I prefer paintings I understand.
foxes, hounds, bugles, that kind of thing.
all this abstraction looks the same to me.
well, in this case, dave, you're right.
this piece of shit is a waste of canvas.
I'm gonna try and claw my way to the ladies'.
and don't sneak out for a smoke. Think of your heart.
I know, I know. I' meet you at the seats.
I know.
Yeah. We met once, oh, shit, where...
davos. - Yeah, switzerland, right, yeah.
the economic forum.
musharraf wouldn't shut up, remember that?
Ooh, man, ballet.
can never get into it. Even the dancers-- which is kind of odd.
you know, you'd think, what could go wrong with a pretty girl in a leotard?
but that body type does nothing for me.
I like 'em a little meatier.
how come you're here? Your girlfriend drag you?
other way around.
no shit. You like ballet?
I like balanchine.
only reason I come to this crap hole of a city is for the culture.
Yeah, that's right. Uh, I thought west virginia was your roost.
I've been spending more time up here.
since the merger. Yeah, of course, of course.
congratulations, by the way.
sailed right through the trade commission.
I've been watching your stock.
too bad about today's little dip, though.
volatility is part of the game.
Oh, of course. You'll bounce right back.
but patty hewes won't let us forget about you.
slinging shit like that all over the airwaves.
what the hell'd you do to her, anyway?
never even met her.
well...
take this from me. Don't engage with her.
you step into the ring with that woman, she will cut your balls off and jam 'em down your throat.
my advice, when she straps one on, bend over, bite down hard and just take it.
anyway... it's good to see you.
Claire, it's me. Sue the bitch.
here's what I got on claire maddox-- name of law school, supreme court clerkship, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
spends three years at a white-collar firm in dc, and then is handpicked by kendrick to join the unr legal department.
she's spent the last 18 years there.
doing what?
kicking ass, mainly.
starts in litigation working antitrust but quickly gets bumped up to associate general counsel.
Kendrick championed maddox.
he took her under his wing.
she's the only female attorney in his company.
then he added vice president to her title, but, uh...
that's not all, there's, uh... Rumors.
about?
a relationship between kendrick and maddox that is less than professional.
interesting. - But not substantiated.
anything else? - Yeah.
I'm sorry, I-I fail to see the strategy in calling walter kendrick a murderer on national television.
ms. Hewes, it's urgent.
Patty hewes? - Yes?
you've been served.
what is it?
it's a defamation suit.
unr's suing me for $200 million.
you leaving?
Yeah, I just got called in. I'm gonna see you later.
I love you.
I love you, too.
you're gonna look sexy when you're bald.
sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you.
I don't know if you remember me. I live in 5e.
I'm president of the co-op board.
Yeah, yeah, I know who you are.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
I never really got to know david, but he seemed like a great guy.
anyway, this was, uh, delivered a while back.
I didn't have a phone number for you, and you didn't leave a forwarding address, so, uh, I've been hanging onto it.
thank you.
the statements ms. Hewes made were true, and therefore she has an absolute defense.
ms. Hewes claimed my client murdered a woman, a woman whose actual killer was incarcerated.
there's absolutely no way she can prove her allegations.
all right, slow down.
this is true?
your client believes mr. Kendrick murdered this christine purcell?
not with his own hands, but yeah.
ms. Hewes believes that mr. Kendrick commissioned this murder.
and what do the police think of that theory?
the man who was arrested for christine purcell's murder, kevin walker, was killed in prison.
assistant D. A.Deevers is looking into his death.
and has found nothing.
so now you're accusing the plaintiff of two murders?
the claim my client made, the subject of this suit, is the murder of christine purcell.
Mr. Kendrick has never been accused or even questioned by the police about either of these deaths.
we'd be happy to present our own evidence that mr. Kendrick was involved.
your own evidence?
this is an obvious stunt to present their own so-called evidence as a way of further defaming my client.
ms. Hewes, do you have a response to that?
I defer to my attorney.
all right, listen, I was tasked by the judge to encourage a settlement here, so let's get to it.
what's it gonna take?
well, ms. Maddox should consider this: If she pursues this action, our only defense is to prove these murder accusations.
does she really want that aired in open court?
and I think mr. Shayes should consider this:
if he can't prove my client was responsible, a jury is going to ram a $200 million bill up his client's ass.
well, it seems to me you both have incentive to come to terms.
are you busy?
just doing some red-lining for tom. Why?
I'm starving.
david used to do most of the cooking for us.
Phil's out of town, just in case you think I'm neglecting him.
he goes away so much, it must be hard.
so is unr serious about this defamation suit, or are they just trying to intimidate you?
Walter kendrick is serious about everything he does.
we want his stock price to keep falling, right? - Yeah.
the judge has ordered the case into mediation.
he wants us to settle.
do you have any idea what else kendrick is up to?
no, not yet.
you told patty that i saw the guy?
I know how you feel abr, t he but she has resources we can use.
so what have you found out?
nothing yet, but I'm gonna hear something soon.
Elle, are you okay? What's going on?
I went back to the apartment.
what? Why?
I needed to see it again.
when I was there, I got a package.
it was from david.
what are you talking about, elle?
he ordered it before he died.
it was delivered to the building.
what was it?
it was my wedding present.
Oh, my god.
what did he give you?
I don't know.
I can't bring myself to open it.
I think I know what patty hewes is angling for.
tell me.
we both know why she went on television.
to drive our stock price down.
Yes. But I've been thinking.
her real goal may be to file a lawsuit on behalf of our shareholders.
she'll claim that the stock took a hit because of the merger and poor management.
well, I've already reassured our shareholders.
and everyone's in line.
Patty can't sue us without a plaintiff.
I think we should settle the defamation suit before she finds one.
why let her off the hook? She knows she can't beat me in court.
right. So she'll be motivated to make a deal.
no. She picked this fight.
I'm not letting this slide.
Walt, our stock won't recover until patty retracts her statements.
I think we let her off easy financially, provided she admits that she had no basis for her accusations.
that way, we neutralize her statements and avoid a long trial.
everyone's got dirty laundry.
do you really want patty hewes going through yours?
don't give her any more time to find a plaintiff.
what are you doing for dinner?
that's your answer?
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
I'm getting together with friends tonight. You want to come along?
you need to decide. Are you going to settle or not?
you'll have my answer by dessert.
Ah, there's my lawyer.
excuse me. What's your poison?
a vodka martini, dirty, extra olive.
put you over there next to mitch.
Mitch mccullen, claire maddox.
lovely to meet you, claire. - Nice to meet you, too.
demographically, the entire nation is changing.
we'll all be in the minority by 2040.
but it's not just us; the entire balance of power in the world is swinging hard towards asia.
how does that make you feel?
me personally?
well, there is no one more endangered than the american caucasian male.
excuse me. I need to make a call.
your manhattan.
I ordered an old-fashioned.
are you sure?
he ordered an old-fashioned.
forgive me, sir. I'll be right back.
job doesn't seem too difficult. You think he'd get one drink right.
I'm going to stretch my legs.
would you like some company?
Oh, no, I'll just be a few minutes. Thanks.
so what do you think?
I'd have worn a shorter skirt if I'd known i was getting pimped out.
Oh, come on, claire.
Mitch lost his wife three years ago in a car accident.
he's not just looking for a roll in the sack.
course, it doesn't hurt he's got his own island.
I don't need help with my personal life, walt.
give the guy a chance.
okay, I will.
if you give me an answer about the settlement.
our stock is still dropping.
have you made up your mind?
I'm telling you, patty wants to file a shareholders' suit.
okay. Settle.
it's part of internal affairs called the citizens review board.
I filed a complaint.
a complaint? You can't trust the police with this.
what was I supposed to do?
I told you I would handle it.
and nothing happened.
his name is eliot tolken.
he's been disciplined a half a dozen times for excessive force.
each time he keeps getting reinstated.
someone in the department is clearly protecting this guy.
and can you get him arrested?
there's nothing to arrest him for.
so patty can't help me then, can she?
we want to trace this guy back to frobisher, then patty's the one to do it.
what is it with you and that woman?
Katie... - David's murdered, and you go right back to working with her.
you don't understand.
all I know is, if you had never met patty, my brother would still be alive.
you don't have to blame me, okay?
I spend enough time blaming myself.
do you? Really?
Yes, and I'm trying to make things right.
how?
I can't explain it all.
this is such bullshit, and you accuse me of not dealing with reality?
I know what I'm doing, katie, okay? This is over your head.
unbelievable.
I'm sorry, but there are bigger things going on here.
things that you wouldn't understand.
right, because you're the lawyer, and I'm an idiot.
look, katie, you got a pretty shitty track record of your life decisions, so please just let me handle this.
go to hell.
can you zip me?
should I put on some music? What do you like?
I like silence.
you smoke?
I used to.
now I only smoke one.
at the end of every day.
only one? - Only one.
no, thanks. I smoke it alone.
ten million to mr. Kendrick's preferred charity.
three.
eight.
four. - Seven.
five.
five is fine.
I think we have an agreement.
always nice when cooler heads prevail.
what is the charity?
the nra.
she's kidding.
it's environment first, a local west virginia organization.
that's perfect.
so, if you'll sign the memorandum of agreement we can send it right on up to the judge.
five million to charity.
I feel good.
I'm surprised. It could've been a lot worse. They could have destroyed us in court.
the only reason they settled was to stop their stock price from hemorrhaging before we could find a plaintiff.
too late.
Claire maddox? - Yes.
you've been served.
what is that? - A lawsuit.
Patty hewes has just sued us on behalf of a major unr shareholder.
who?
thank you for your discretion.
I didn't want all my associates to know we're working together yet.
you're welcome.
I think your little tete-a-tete with kendrick gave him the extra push we needed.
listen, I will be your plaintiff, but we're not friends.
I don't like you.
well, I'm just glad we could help each other out.
I'm in this for me.
understood.
8
Katie, it's me. Please call me back.
I'm sorry. We need to talk.
I found a unr shareholder who's willing to sue the company.
that's good news.
Claire maddox will try to get it thrown out of court, but if we can get to the discovery phase, we can find out what kendrick is hiding.
I look forward to it.
how are things going with katie?
good, yeah. Fine.
the policeman she saw...
hopefully he'll lead back to frobisher.
shit. She filed a complaint?
it's not an issue.
I have friends in internal affairs.
if the C. C.R. B.Kicks it upstairs we'll find a way to make it disappear.
all right.
but that doesn't mean the problem goes away.
that's what I'm saying.
we need to do what we should've done a long time ago.
you really should lock your door.
where... is the goddamn videotape?
I don't know.
well, what about david connor?
do I have to worry about him?
no.
there's nothing that can get back to you.
Wes, is that you?
Ultima National Resources have systematically ravaged the environment.
Walter Kendrick believes that he can get away with anything.
Patty Hewes had just sued us on behalf of a major UNR shareholder.
who?
I'm in this for me.
understood.
this is the man who was following me.
he's a cop.
he must have been working for Frobisher.
no wonder they haven't gotten anywhere with David's murder.
this is my first real lead.
Katie Connor saw you?
what if she talks?
we need to do what we should have done a long time ago.
Arthur Frobisher had your fiancee killed, didn't he?
she's been meeting with someone.
looks like law enforcement. I think it's FBI.
merger's gone through.
you ready on your end?
Yeah. Let's get going.
Kendrick overpaid to acquire that company.
well, if he overpaid, he must have a way to make that money back.
we have to find out what that is.
Oh! Excuse me!
Ellen, Uncle Pete.
uncle Pete's been with Patty longer than any of us.
he's really the one who runs everything around here.
thanks for the heads up, Ellen.
we looked into Uncle Pete.
his full name is Peter McKee.
dishonorable discharge from the army in '49, with a criminal record that goes back some 52 years.
a record for what?
all sorts of petty stuff.
burglary, larceny, bribing a city official.
20 years ago, he was arrested for using neighborhood kids to run a numbers racket.
all charges were dismissed.
and guess who his attorney was?
you got it.
and there's been no record of him breaking the law ever since.
Pete's been by her side for decades.
I can't believe I didn't think of this sooner.
no. We're getting somewhere, Ellen.
if Pete McKee knows where Patty's skeletons are buried, we'll find them.
I've arranged a press conference to announce you as my lead plaintiff.
I've written down some words that I'd like you to say about me.
don't you think this is pouring it on a bit thick?
you destroyed my reputation.
I want it back.
you're the only one who can give it to me.
so, that's why you're doing this?
for your image?
no, I didn't say image.
I said reputation. There's a difference.
ever since I got out of the hospital,
I've sought the counsel of a spiritual advisor.
Really? - Yes.
I have clarity now.
I made mistakes...
and I can admit that.
that's big of you.
but I'm no Walt Kendrick.
now, that guy is a destructive force.
he tears things down.
he rapes the environment for profit.
I don't do that.
I'm a builder.
well, if you're going to rebuild your reputation, a few kind words from me at a press conference won't be enough.
the other side is going to attack you.
I know how these things work.
and based on our previous experience together,
I'm sure you'll understand why it's necessary to vet your financials.
fair enough. You can have anything you want.
I have nothing to hide.
good.
come in.
Patty, you wanted to see...
Arthur, I'm not sure you remember my associate, Ellen Parsons.
Oh, yes. Hi.
Mr. Frobisher's going to be our lead plaintiff in the UNR case.
Oh, I can't take this noise.
this noise is the closest thing there is to musical epic poetry.
one more bump, that's it.
you have to pace yourself.
Oh, shit!
goddamn it!
no running!
Andrew, stop the horseplay.
Oh! He's a wild man.
listen to this, Allison.
a male sea lion can weigh up to 700 pounds.
so?
they can hold their breath for 15 minutes, dive over 500 feet, and reach a speed of 25 miles per hour.
so?
that's a remarkably efficient use of resources.
seals are stupid.
sea lions. These are sea lions.
they've lived in New York since before you were born.
I hate coming to New York.
Why?
new York sucks.
you know, when your great-great grandfather left Scotland, he came to New York.
so?
it's the land of opportunity.
if a man is honest and works hard, if he's productive, there's no telling what he can accomplish here.
go play with your cousins, Ally.
what is it, Dave?
I'm with my grandkids.
my trader got busted with a hooker.
he was arrested?
there was a mishap.
he was with a girl. They were partying.
so, the trade didn't go through?
no.
we'll try again this week.
find someone new.
I can't do that.
find someone new.
he screwed up.
but he's in a unique position to help us.
I have restless shareholders and a goddamn lawsuit against me.
I am not going to risk exposure.
you're on the national stage now,
Walt, which is exactly where you wanted to be.
if you didn't take risks, you'd be back in Appalachia ruling over the toothless masses.
look...
the incident was unfortunate.
it won't happen again.
I've had his name taken off the police report, but we have to take care of the girl.
take care of her how?
we need a lawyer, Walt.
one we can trust.
you've drifted. Stay present.
your breath is shallow. You're not focused.
I'm-I'm struggling with this press conference.
in what regard?
am I getting involved with these people for the-the right reason?
right, wrong.
what are your reasons?
I-I made mistakes.
I'd like to use my-my talents, my... my gifts, to-to correct things.
Arthur, if you want to change the world, first change yourself.
then your part in changing the world is finished.
I don't think I'm there yet.
it's a monumental task, changing oneself.
you need to become more self-centered.
I'm pretty selfish as it is.
not selfish. Focused on self.
one's aim should be to know oneself truly, apart from one's place in the world.
I may have to have you explain that to me again.
breathe.
rage without focus isn't a strategy.
Frobisher is the only shareholder who is willing to sue right now.
we don't always have the luxury of choosing our friends.
if we keep Frobisher close to us, we may be able to get information that can help you prove he was involved in David's murder.
you should have asked me first.
but I didn't.
shit.
uh, coming!
Oh, Jesus.
now, if you're on a diet-- chicken, fish or meat
high protein-- well, that's what this machine does
chicken, fish or meat.
this is bullshit.
what are we still kicking up to McKee for?
the guy's 100 years old. - Shut up.
he's like a grandfather to me.
show some respect.
uh, if you go to Key Food, please pick up some fresh fruit.
you got it, sweetie.
Hey, fellas, we got a new shipment coming for you next week.
all right, the guy in the track suit...
that's Timothy McAdams.
and the other guy, that's, uh, Michael O'Shea.
now, both of those guys got rap sheets.
looks like we found a way in.
it's an improvement.
you got some body shots in.
if you were attacked by a guy wearing epaulets...
okay, Asshole.
I'm serious.
it is your fault if I suck, by the way, 'cause you're supposed to be teaching me.
I'm trying.
? how do you know so much about guns, anyway?
my dad was a...
violent dude.
he was a Marine.
I shot my first gun when I was eight.
he took me and my brother into the woods, gave us a Bushmaster A3, preached the doctrine of "one shot, one kill."
you making any progress on that Frobisher thing?
let's not talk about that.
I want to hear more about you.
like what?
I don't know. Anything.
what are we doing here, Parsons?
what do you mean?
you know what I mean.
Wes... - Let's have dinner or something.
I'd like to have a conversation with you that doesn't involve firearms.
you know my situation, I...
and I respect that.
but we both know what's going on here, and I don't want to dance around it anymore.
Hey, look, if it's just me, say so.
I won't bring it up again.
okay.
that's fine.
I'm sorry, Wes. - No, no, no, don't.
I understand.
same time next week?
Yeah, sure. - Okay.
this is definitely him.
so, when I filed my complaint with Internal Affairs...
the wrong person must have found out about it.
someone decided this guy is a liability.
we've lost our only lead.
I should have listened to you.
I don't blame you for being anxious.
David's dead, and Frobisher's still out there, but...
these are powerful people.
there's clearly corruption.
we can't go through the normal channels.
and we can't turn on each other.
what else do you know about him?
Patty's investigator found out he moonlighted for a security firm
calder Protective Services.
we're still finding out exactly what kind of work he did there.
Mr. Frobisher.
what the hell are you doing here?
you're going to pull out of this lawsuit.
how did you find me?
and you're going to stop all contact with Patty Hewes.
no, actually, I'm not.
how is this any of your goddamn business?
you need to be very careful right now.
you don't want to be in the spotlight.
why is that?
Katie Connor is back in the picture.
no, no, no, no.
no, I'm-I'm through with that.
no, I've moved on. Uh-uh.
you don't get to do that.
look, asshole,
I've been through some really rough shit recently.
I'm not that guy anymore.
you started this, Mr. Frobisher.
the decision was yours.
no one forced you to make it.
you said so yourself.
once you go down this road, there's no turning back.
watch me.
your Honor, the defendant was caught with more than an eighth of an ounce of cocaine, which she readily admits was hers.
that's a class E felony.
we don't dispute that, but my client has no prior felony drug convictions.
this is a first-time offense.
how about her two arrests for prostitution?
you saw her record.
you know both counts were dismissed.
your Honor, Ms. Samble works as an escort.
the service she provides is purely social.
regardless, her profession is immaterial here.
agreed.
stick to the facts, counsel.
and make sure they're relevant.
thank you, Your Honor.
ms. Samble.
do you plead guilty to this offense?
I do, Your Honor.
in light of this being Ms. Samble's first possession charge,
your Honor, I beg the court's leniency.
all right, Ms. Maddox.
defendant is given probation, but if it happens again, it will be jail time.
my grandchildren are here for the rest of the week.
what do you do with kids in this city?
there's a reason I don't have children.
take 'em to a movie. That'll shut them up.
do you want to tell me what I was doing in that courtroom?
I'm sorry, Claire.
the john's name was blacked out on the police report.
was that you?
I won't ask a favor like this again, but you were the only one I could trust with it.
I don't care about the favor, but you can't be out cavorting in the middle of a major lawsuit.
I get the message.
and we need to discuss Frobisher's press conference.
Frobisher is just more bullshit media attention to keep the stock down.
all they want is a settlement.
no, Patty's not looking for a quick hit, and Frobisher isn't in this for the money.
he's back to salvage his name.
this is going to be a long, drawn-out proceeding.
what are you suggesting?
get the stock prices up.
do whatever it takes.
I've already lined up investors.
we're going to have a significant influx of capital very soon, and we'll make up the merger deficit.
and you were going to tell me about this when?
when the deal was done.
which it will be soon.
I can't do my job, Walt, if I don't have all the information.
once we get that capital, the stock will rebound and this lawsuit will be history.
what happened?
we got to try again.
the trader screwed up.
yeah?
Claire Maddox was defending a woman on cocaine charges.
I looked into her. She works for an escort service.
why would the lead counsel of an energy company be defending a hooker on a drug bust?
I have no idea.
couldn't find any connection to UNR.
so I checked the police report.
there was someone else in the car when the escort was arrested.
a john?
that would be my guess.
the name was redacted from the police report.
so, this escort is taking the fall for someone.
she must be.
find her. Run it down.
Arthur Frobisher is a great American.
recently, I've had the opportunity to get to know the private man, and I have been deeply impressed by his character and his resolve.
I have come to see that he is by nature, a builder.
he is an inspiring human being whose passion in life is to create, not destroy.
I am pleased that we have set aside our differences and I am proud that I can count Arthur Frobisher my friend and my partner in this great cause.
thank you, Patty.
this case is about greed, pure and simple.
it's about a CEO, who has circumvented every safety and environmental regulation on the books and engineered a catastrophic merger, all to increase his personal base of power at the expense of his shareholders.
now, the fact is that I,
I was so impressed, years ago, with Mr. Kendrick's vision that I became a major stockholder in his company.
but time has tested Mr. Kendrick and he's failed that test.
so, now, as a person who has a stake in this company,
I feel it's my duty to hold him accountable.
and that's why I'm here today.
every man deserves the best.
what kind of work do you do?
does it make a difference?
not a bit.
so, what do you like, mystery man?
I just want to talk.
Oh, one of those.
it's gonna cost you the same.
there you go.
no offense, but I was hoping to see Susie tonight.
Susie's a very busy girl.
but she only sees a few customers.
does she have regulars?
we all do.
do you happen to know some of her regulars?
I don't talk about other clients.
Susie got arrested the other night.
don't know if you knew about that.
was she with one of her regulars?
his name's Finn Garrety.
I saw him a couple of times. He's a creep.
but Susie doesn't seem to mind.
he takes care of her.
thank you very much, Gabriella.
thanks for the drink.
wait.
you're all paid up.
you sure you don't want to stay?
you wanted to see me?
the only reason we filed this suit was to get our hands on those documents.
what are we looking for exactly?
e-mails, memos, anything that gets behind Kendrick's real motives for the merger.
Tom's supervising. I want you to, uh, assist.
all right.
hope I'm not interrupting.
stefania wanted you to have this.
try one.
what is it?
polish pastry.
uncle Pete's wife makes it.
you'll never taste anything better.
I didn't know you were married.
almost 60 years.
enjoy.
Thanks, Pete.
how long have you known Uncle Pete?
since I was a kid.
is he really your uncle?
he's my mother's brother.
and the most loyal man I'll ever know.
what's up, fellas? - What's up?
how was the ride from Jersey?
you know the tunnel.
we heard good things about you guys.
said you move shit quick, always pay in cash.
Yeah.
well, let's see it.
you got bonus features, original artwork, everything.
it's good shit.
Where'd you get it?
it fell off a truck.
okay... how much?
you take it all, I'll give it to you for nine grand even.
no, no, no-- seven.
come on, you can offload this for 20, easy.
we got seven grand right here, you want it or not?
all right.
count it.
don't bother.
Hey, Pete McKee?
FBI. What do you say we do this quietly?
Hey, I was just talking with my pals.
Yeah, I know. I heard every word.
three grand is a nice little payoff, huh?
come on.
how's it feel? Your buddy flipped on you.
congratulations, Uncle Pete.
you've graduated to racketeering.
and having stolen merchandise crossing state lines, you get to talk to the Feds.
and we got two options for you.
well, he's not gonna like the first option.
Nope-- ten years in prison; 250 large in fines.
no takers?
the man's not interested.
tell him what's behind door number two.
you go home to your wife.
you live out the rest of your days together.
you'll be there with Stefania...
when she dies of lung disease.
what's the catch?
you give us Patty Hewes.
this is about Patty?
of course, if you don't have anything on Patty, then option two goes away.
and you go straight to jail.
sorry, fellas. I've got nothing for you.
do you really think Patty gives a shit about you?
you have no idea. I'd be a bum on the street; I'd be dead if it wasn't for that woman.
you sons of bitches!
you have no idea.
Pete, I understand.
but you're gonna have to screw somebody.
now, who's it gonna be?
how long do you think Stefania's got left to live, anyway?
Oh, God, uh...
three, four months tops.
shame on you!
Yeah, shame on us.
but are you gonna give us Patty?
or are you gonna abandon your dying wife?
what do I have to do?
it's simple.
you tell Patty you got busted, you need some cash to pay off the cops...
she says yes, you get it on tape, we're in business.
no.
if I'm going to do this to Patty,
I can't see her again.
I couldn't look her in the eye.
all right, then what do you suggest?
I have evidence.
evidence that will put her away.
where is the evidence?
in a storage locker.
I got the key at my house.
all right, Pete.
let's go.
no, wait.
my wife will wonder where I went.
can I pick up some strawberries?
yeah... yeah, we can get some strawberries.
did you have fun with your hooker?
we talked, we shared some laughs.
is that all?
Hey, I was home by 10: 00.
it's okay if I fact-check that with Deb?
look, the important thing is I got us a name.
do I know who this is?
holds a doctorate in Advanced Economic Theory from MIT.
youngest guy ever to be offered a full professorship;
turned it down to work on Wall Street.
real maverick.
also a bit of a head case.
garrety is a commodities trader.
so what's Walter Kendrick's interest in him?
that's the kicker.
he trades exclusively...
in the energy market.
t minus 15 seconds.
Houston... ain't gonna be no problem.
three...
two...
one...
1899/12/31 0: 02: 00
Finn, what was all that about?
you're asking the questions now?
just wondering.
if you really want to know-- that was about money, babe.
it's all about money.
I like that.
good.
now turn around and face the wall.
we've got a lot of work to do.
we're good.
the trade went through.
all right.
I'll be in touch.
okay.
so, who's up for some ice cream after lunch?
okay! - Yeah!
we scoured Frobisher's financial records, and ran a background check.
I'm afraid nothing pointed directly to David's murder.
but we did find something interesting.
for the past decade,
Frobisher's had a high-end security firm on retainer.
the same firm your missing policeman moonlighted for.
calder Protective Services.
we have a lead.
because we took Frobisher on as a client.
thank you, Patty.
Hey.
special Agents Randall Harrison and L. J. Werner.
definitely FBI.
Ellen Parsons is a lawyer.
a thousand reasons why she's meeting with these guys.
then why the sudden interest in learning how to shoot?
she's scared.
she wants protection.
and what about the missing cop?
she still pursuing that?
I don't know.
I can't get her to talk about it.
you can't?
maybe I should take you off this thing, stick you someplace else.
okay, look, you slipped up here, right?
I'm sure it feels like you're walking around, and your dick's hanging out.
it's no fun. I get it.
but trust me.
she's not talking revenge anymore, right?
so let me play this my way.
what way is that?
Ellen isn't stupid.
if I push too hard, she'll shut down, but if I just step back, she'll come to me.
then I can get her to open up.
all right, whatever. It's not my decision.
you're right.
it's not.
if Parsons isn't talking, you'll have to try someone else.
who?
I told you Frobisher hired that guy.
we still don't have proof of that.
we need to look into the security firm.
but we're getting somewhere.
I understand.
Oh...
I don't believe it.
what?
Hey! Krulik!
you know him?
from grief counseling.
this is weird.
well, that's the great thing about New York.
you can run into anyone.
No! No, it's not like that.
I had a boyfriend.
Oh. - We just broke up recently, you know.
um, that's rough.
it just didn't feel right.
well, it's hard to know when you're really ready.
I think I'm ready for something now, but with Mark, it was just a little too soon.
shit.
I have to take this.
I'll be right back. - Okay.
what is it?
Pete's not going to be in the office tomorrow.
you arrested him?
Yeah.
and by the end of the night, we should have what we need on Patty.
thanks for the heads up.
Oh...
I was getting worried.
sorry I didn't call, sweetie.
I brought you some more fruit.
Oh!
these are Patty's clients.
sweetie, I got to get something from the kitchen.
if you don't mind, keep these fellows company, will you?
would you like a strawberry?
where is this storage unit?
ten minutes away.
McGinness and Freeman.
I got the key here somewhere.
there's a trunk in the storage unit.
it holds everything I got on Patty.
I'll take you there.
you're doing the right thing, Mr. McKee.
I gotta hit the can.
I gotta give Stefania her medication before I leave.
hey...
leave the door open.
what is case?
it's a securities case. - Ah.
stocks. We're, uh... We're suing the company.
Oh. - Mm.
she is something, this Patty, yes.
tough as nails.
but very nice lady once you know her.
well, she seems like a real doll.
let's go.
here you go.
huh?
we're going back to the office.
I'll be home in a bit.
no smoking.
? Oh, boy.
you poke it, you stab it, you jab it, you give the...
Oh, my goodness gracious.
let me take these knives and put them where they belong, - okay? - All right.
right over here.
that's that. Problem solved.
so, Ron, what really great, innovative products have you brought us here?
well, I've created the greatest knife.
a knife that will never get dull.
we call it the Showtime Six Card Plus Series.
which one is it?
third shelf.
the trunk.
what's the combination?
Oh, shit!
unr's lead counsel was defending a prostitute on drug charges.
she was with an energy trader-- finn garrety.
Kendrick could be using him to
the trade went through.
all right.
does finn know a guy by the name of walter kendrick?
I-I don't know.
can you try and find out?
I'll see what I can do.
the stock will rise, the case will vanish. Invest in unr, phil.
I want to take a position in unr.
we both know what's going on here.
I don't want to dance around it anymore.
let's have dinner or something.
okay.
maybe I should take you off this thing.
she'll come to me.
if parsons isn't talking, you'll have to try someone else.
who? - Katie connor.
I'm agent harrison. This is agent werner. We're with the fbi.
Pete swallowed a bottle of his wife's meds so that he wouldn't have to give us evidence on patty.
what did the feds ask you for?
if I don't give 'em enough to put you in jail, they're putting me there.
you give them whatever you need to.
Patty, I called the hospital to check in on pete.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I was wrong. I don't think patty had pete killed.
why not?
she seems genuinely thrown by his death.
she believes that he arranged it himself to protect her.
well, if it wasn't patty, then who did it?
I don't know, but she blames you guys.
this is like a call to war for her.
meaning what?
meaning you're not just targeting her now.
she's targeting you.
the firm is being investigated by the fbi?
I'm afraid so.
how do you know?
they came to me.
they asked me to inform on patty.
I turned 'em down.
then they went to pete.
is that why he...
he didn't want to give up anything that could hurt us.
Jesus.
so now we have to circle the wagons.
has anyone approached you?
of course not.
no unusual overtures?
I would have told you.
when were you going to tell me?
I'm telling you now.
I'm sorry, mr. Shayes.
I have to see patty.
you're not allowed in here.
well, it's, it's urgent.
I have strict orders from ms. Hewes.
believe me, she's going to want to hear what i have to say.
sir, you're not allowed in the building anymore.
let's do this the easy way.
well, uh, tell patty that I tried to warn her.
and let her know that I'm filing a suit against her for, for wrongful termination!
hope you know what you're doing.
I do.
Ellen, don'T.
it's not who you are.
energy secretary has a heart attack at his own wedding.
pathetic.
it was going to be his third marriage. He knew what he was doing.
where are they on replacing him at the department of energy?
I'm on the president's search committee.
we're just beginning to look.
in this climate, we're likely to get some regulation crusader who thinks he's another goddamn eliot ness.
use your pull. Install an ally.
I plan to.
in the meantime, I want to step up the frequency of our transactions.
there's only so many times we're going to be able to pull this off before someone notices.
you're not getting cold feet, are you, walt?
no, dave.
good. Then get the information to my trader.
we're being investigated by the fbi, and you didn't tell me?
Tom... - You had no right to withhold that.
this isn't just about you, patty. I'm a partner here. I'm vulnerable, too.
Yes, you are, so just calm down, and we'll figure out what we're going to do about this.
who can you talk to that has an in at the bureau?
no one. I can't risk exposing myself.
then I'll make a call because we need information.
what's up?
last time I saw that face, you were 18 and thought you got your prom date pregnant.
it's about patty, isn't it?
I think the firm's under investigation.
under investigation by who?
the fbi. - For what?
I have no idea.
I told you you should have cut and run after the frobisher case.
look, I-I know your feelings about patty and her legal ethics.
so let me guess.
you want me to use my contacts to get you information about the investigation.
I need to know what they have on patty.
I am an assistant U. S.Attorney.
what you're asking is totally inappropriate.
please. It's my, it's my career.
I can't believe you're putting me in this position.
look, I don't know what to say. You're my sister.
I need your help.
fine. I'll see what I can find out.
Mr. Garrety, thank you for coming.
you got a real nice club here.
thank you, have a seat.
there's a new itinerary.
we going on another trip? Same car?
you'll be contacted with new codes. We're going to try another location.
they have something salty around here? Maybe some nuts?
I'm sure we can accommodate you.
better yet, maybe some of the chinese mix with the wasabi peas.
certainly.
first, though, how are your meetings going?
my meetings?
Oh, you mean for the... going great.
I totally kicked the stuff.
and the girl?
she's history, too.
these are smart moves, mr. Garrety, because if you want me to ensure your continued fiscal success, you won't ever make another mess for me again.
if you know another trader who can do what I do, mr. Pell, use him.
otherwise, stay out of my face.
forget about the nuts.
better not miss.
she should be so lucky.
you miss this and i run the table.
we'll see about that.
you are a terrible pool player.
maybe that's just what I want you to think.
the hustle began hours ago. You just didn't notice it.
is that so?
first I invite myself to girls' night out.
I throw a game or two, and before you know it, the gouging starts and you lose your shirts.
I can't wait.
or maybe I am just a terrible pool player.
here. I'm gonna get a club soda. You want anything?
no, I'm good.
laying off the sauce. Smart.
you want to stay sharp while i mount my comeback.
Yeah, good luck with that.
sorry I'm a third wheel. I hope you don't mind.
no. No, it's fine.
how you doing?
I'm fine.
look, about this dinner party we're hosting...
what about it?
my instinct is to cancel, but it might be nice for you to have some friends around.
that's fine.
do they know how uncle pete died?
the hospital is still investigating.
but you think he killed himself.
or had someone help him.
Pete was trying to protect me.
look at me.
what? - Drop the unr case.
I can't do that.
you've confirmed the fbi is targeting you.
Yes, and as far as I'm concerned, they killed uncle pete.
they're trying to intimidate me.
they want me to back down.
this is about power protecting itself.
I threaten them, and they hate me for it.
who's they?
the fbi, the government, walter kendrick and unr-- they're all the same.
you're being paranoid.
they're closing in on me, phil. They approached ellen, they approached pete.
and look what happened.
Patty, stop.
please stop.
no. I'm not going to let them get away with it.
so, you, uh, wanted to see me? - Yeah.
I'm concerned about what's going on between you and wes.
what's going on?
I can see in group that the two of you are getting... close?
I think maybe you should come to different sessions from now on.
I've also spoken to wes.
and what did he say?
he agreed.
it's not healthy, ellen.
you think it's too soon after david?
I think you and wes may be filling a need for each other that's based on grief.
what's wrong with that?
it can be emotionally dangerous.
so can loneliness.
but jumping into a relationship just to fill the loneliness won't help.
you want my advice?
Absolutely.
you know I value your opinion.
energy is not my field. I'm not sure I know anyone who's even qualified.
since when has that been necessary for a government appointment?
right.
this is a cabinet position.
I don't need an expert. I need someone who's going to support the industry.
well, that's a tall order.
I mean, given the mood in washington, there's no way the senate's going to confirm anyone who's not pro-regulation.
true.
but if I know you, that's not what you want.
you're looking for someone who reads interventionist, but who has a free market heart.
see?
that's why I came to you.
have you thought about sam arsenault?
Ah, word is, he's a bit unpredictable.
started as an independent, then tried to get the republicans to back him for governor.
trust me, sam arsenault's only real loyalty is to the capitalist party.
we're going to have a little dinner party on friday night.
if I can get arsenault to be there, do you want to meet him?
you're tense. Relax. Relax. Breathe. That's it.
it's firm, not tight.
it feels like i won't be able to control it.
you try to control it too much, you get stiff and lose accuracy.
keep breathing.
how's that? - Feels good.
let her rip.
I see it, but I don't believe it.
believe it, cowboy. - Hang it in your office.
I think you'll find people will treat you a little nicer.
that is a very good idea.
better to be feared than respected.
thanks for helping me.
Ellen, I owe you an apology.
for what?
a couple weeks ago, i shouldn't have asked you out.
Oh, don't worry about that.
no. I pushed you. It was wrong.
I'm a big girl. I can handle it.
I think we both know that you and I shouldn't get involved.
the way we met, therapy.
you agree, right? - Yeah.
yeah? - Yeah.
good. Me, too, because I was, um...
this is awkward.
I was wondering if I could ask out your friend.
Katie? - If it's okay.
Yeah. - Yeah, we had fun the other night, and...
Yeah, of course. I'll give you her number.
I haven't met with katie connor alone yet.
I got nothing to report.
I got something else for you.
what am I supposed to do with these?
deliver them to jersey. The address is in the glove compartment.
no. No, no.
did you just say no?
I agreed to do this thing with ellen parsons, but i am done with this other shit.
no.
you're done when I say you are.
make sure the tank's full when you bring it back.
Thanks, baby. - Your dealer is a creep.
Yeah, but his shit's good.
you want?
no. I'm getting clean for my kid.
that's very sweet.
but what's going on with that lawyer who was asking about me?
nothing. He keeps calling, and I keep blowing him off.
good girl.
this ever traces back to me, I will be disbarred.
so will I. Mutually assured destruction.
I requisitioned the fbi file on hewes & associates.
what do they have on patty?
Tom, there was no file.
what do you mean?
it means, there's no official file on patty hewes or her firm.
was it classified? - No.
even if it were, there would still be a file.
it would be off-limits, but there would be a record the investigation existed.
was there anything on pete mckee? - No.
nothing on anybody involved with hewes & associates, including you.
I don't get it.
the fbi approached one of our associates.
uncle pete killed himself so the government couldn't use him against patty.
I don't know what to tell you. There's no investigation.
no file? That doesn't make any sense.
the guys who approached you-- you sure they were legit?
Yeah. They were fbi.
you're sure? - Absolutely.
are you sure you can trust your sister?
she wouldn't have told me unless she were 100%.
what the hell is going on?
what is really going on with this investigation?
what do you mean?
the fbi has no file on patty hewes, tom shayes, or on me.
who told you that?
I have my sources.
you need to tell us where you heard that.
why the hell is there no record of this investigation?
do we tell her?
I think it's time she knew the truth.
we don't work for the fbi, ellen.
who do you work for?
the ipf. - The what?
inter-planetary federation?
you never saw men in black?
Oh, you guys are jackasses.
Ellen, listen.
we know patty has contacts at the justice department.
we had to pull the file.
we couldn't risk letting anyone tip her off.
you understand?
you'd better be telling me the truth.
well, she's resourceful.
Yeah, I get that, but I don't like her.
question is, can we trust her intel?
can we?
coming.
Ugh, relax, will ya?
new clients are always impatient.
who are you?
my name's patty.
the attorney you've been talking to is a partner in my firm.
you stopped returning his calls.
what do you want?
I'd like an explanation of what happened the night you and finn garrety were arrested.
who are you calling? - My agency. You have to leave.
well, in that case, I'll just call finn.
let him know you see other clients.
go ahead. He won't care. - No?
he doesn't think you're exclusive?
we're on the same side here. All I want to do is talk.
you gonna pay for the hour?
I've looked into you.
I know you're trying to put yourself through school.
you also have a failed marriage, two stints in rehab, a kid you never see, and you're in one hell of a custody battle.
now, if you come in and talk to us, I will pay for your tuition in night school.
I will give you protection, and I'll put in a good word with your family court judge.
and if I don't talk to you?
family courts don't take kindly to mothers who are prostitutes.
it would be a shame if they found out.
Dave, great to see you.
glad you could make it. - Thank you.
it doesn't really matter if the economy tanks, as long as people need doctors, medical malpractice attorneys will have work.
doesn't say much for the state of health care.
you shouldn't be telling him this.
I'm going in for a simple hernia surgery next week.
Oh, yeah, they're all simple until they're not.
thank you. Thank you very much.
Hey, sport. - Hey, mr. Arsenault.
how's lily doing?
Oh, it's been pretty tough since the arrest.
but yale's considering taking her back.
that's great. Tell her I said hi. - Sure will.
say hello to dave pell.
I've heard a lot about you, dave. - Sam.
what's your poison? - Gimlet, gin.
coming up, you okay? - I'm fine, thanks, phil.
I hear I'm being vetted.
rumors travel halfway around the world before truth can tie its shoes.
so, are we traveling or lacing up?
depends. Are you interested?
bill richardson. Now, there's a man who did it right.
serves one term as energy secretary under clinton, then heads home and becomes governor.
I've always wanted to be governor.
that's an admirable goal.
ask around. I'm a pragmatist.
you're prepared to faithfully represent the interests of your country?
well, we're all businessmen here, are we?
Phil, what's going on out there?
is it safe for me to jump back into the market?
that depends how strong your stomach is.
come on, phil, give us a little something.
well, there are ample opportunities out there.
like mr. Buffet says, "when everybody else is fearful, it's time to be greedy.
look, the point is, these things are cyclical.
the market is a force of nature, and the economy is going to correct itself.
with a little oversight.
my wife and I are of the same mind on a great number of things.
this is the one area where we differ.
Phil makes the mistake of believing that man is inherently good.
no, I believe that man is inherently self-interested, and the only way to keep self-interest in check is through free market competition.
Sam, you'll back me up on that.
what? What was the question?
Sam, whose side are you on anyway?
whoever refills this first.
so, did wes call you?
Yes.
kind of out of the blue, actually.
he asked me for your number. I hope you don't mind.
no.
I don't even know if this is a weird question to ask.
would you mind if I went out with him?
Jesus. You need to ask my permission, as well?
he asked the same thing?
Yes. And no, I don't mind. God, why would I mind?
I don't know, i thought maybe you two might have something.
we're just friends. I'm not ready for that.
so, how much have you told him?
I mean, about david and frobisher.
we've talked about it. Um, you know, things come up in group.
cause I don't want to say something that i shouldn'T.
well, then, don'T.
right.
Ellen, seriously, if you don't want me to go...
no, katie, it's fine. I promise.
Oh, no, no, no, you're not going to go shy on us.
Oh, look, that was a one-time thing.
that's bullshit. You do it at the drop of a hat.
all right, so drop a hat. Just one.
Michael! Bring down the keyboard.
Ah, I'll go get him. - That's my man.
okay, dave, this one's for you. What's it going to be?
Danny boy.
are you serious?
it's a family favorite.
Oh, I used to do it at brown with the jabberwocks.
uh, try to imagine me in gray flannels and white bucks. You ready, michael?
and to think his company has a $4 billion market capitalization.
all these guys.
to the manner born.
what about you?
my dad smelted steel for 37 years.
Cheers.
Thanks.
you and sam arsenault still partnering in your, uh, charity foundation?
Yes.
what do you think of him?
I think he's a terrific guy, but you have to watch out.
why is that?
because, when you peel away all his glad-handing, honey-voiced charm, what's left is an entitled brat who considers himself above the rules.
he'll tell you exactly what you want to hear, and then turn around and stab you in the back.
good to know.
you boys seem all worked up. Where is the fire?
why is there no record of all the reports we've submitted?
excuse me?
we want to know why we don't have clearance to the case file for this investigation.
you mean this case file?
the investigation is strictly need-to-know. - Since when?
since the deputy director said it was.
Why?
the bureau has made this case a top priority, which means it can make or break a career
my career-- so stop whining and go out and get me something on patty hewes.
you like idaho?
I think it's our best bet.
is the plant manager willing to play ball?
definitely.
I spoke to my meteorologist.
he's predicting a foot of snow. Should be a big demand for home heating.
once we shut down supply, there should be a pretty healthy spike in price.
unless the storm shifts north.
Yeah, there's always that risk, but I still think that's the way to go.
you usually give me more options.
you usually give me more time.
fine. Idaho.
let me know when they plan to go off-line.
will do.
before finn and i were arrested that night, he made a stop.
he got out of our car and went into an suv.
was he meeting someone?
no. There was no one else there. Finn had his own set of keys.
what was he doing? I don't know.
he sat in the suv for a couple we drove off.
did you see what kind of suv it was?
a cadillac, I think. You know, the big one.
what was mr. Garrety's state of mind at the time? Did he seem anxious?
when he's coked up, it's a little hard to tell.
is there anything else you can remember?
that's all I saw.
okay, lonnie.
thank you for coming in.
Yeah, sure.
I had a nice chat with your family court judge.
I think you'll find he's sympathetic to joint custody.
thank you, ms. Hewes.
what's your verdict on sam arsenault?
he's got pipes. Hell of a singer.
and for the position?
I want to thank you for making the introduction, but, uh, truth be told, we're leaning in a different direction now.
more conservative?
more you.
you're a brilliant manager.
I don't know, dave.
Phil, you and I grew up in finance, and we both made a mint.
but I didn't get to where I am now until I went to washington.
and where is that? - Connected.
I don't see myself in government.
then do what I did.
stay for a year or two and jump back into the private sector.
I hate politics. You know that.
Yeah, but a decision like this isn't about politics.
it's about power. Influence.
you're rich, phil, but what's next?
will you kick it around?
I'll consider it, but I'm not making any promises.
understood, understood.
it's a pleasure to meet you, ms. Hewes. Have a seat.
no, thank you.
I'm here to tell you that I hold the fbi responsible for the death of pete mckee.
I'm sorry, but i don't know what you're referring to.
bullshit.
and you can tell who's ever calling the shots in washington that I'm on to them.
the bureau may be watching me, but I'm also watching you.
ma'am, I understand you're upset, but right about now, you're going to want to check your tone.
this investigation is corrupt, and when I prove it, your career will be over.
you don't want to threaten me.
I don't make threats, mr. Mcgraff.
this is war.
Patty hewes came to see me.
what do you want me to do?
forgive my place. Still putting it together.
sort of in-between gigs right now.
Oh, me, too. I totally get it. Thanks.
so, you were saying...
you were asking about grief counseling.
Yeah, I was wondering why you never went.
I'm not really into group therapy.
I see my own therapist. - Makes sense.
can I ask you something?
this sounds ominous.
you know, it's none of my business.
what?
it's not appropriate.
what?
I know ellen thinks that arthur frobisher had something to do with your brother's death.
do you think that? - I know he did.
why not go to the police?
because frobisher has got the police in his pocket.
so, you believe ellen's whole conspiracy theory.
Oh, it's not just a theory.
when patty hewes took on frobisher's case, she got all of his financial records.
from the shareholder thing. - Yeah.
Frobisher uses this private security firm which employs off-duty officers.
you think one of them did it?
you know what, I'd really rather not talk about this.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't even brought it up. - It's fine.
it's just that ellen thinks about it all the time, and I worry about her.
I understand.
so, chinese, italian? - Wes.
there's a very good, um, brazilian place like a block from here.
Wes, why did you call me? - What do you mean?
it's obvious that you're not actually into me.
what are you talking about?
you want to be with ellen.
is everything okay?
Yeah. Everything's fine.
Katie said she called off your date.
Yeah.
you talk to katie connor? - Yeah.
Ellen parsons knows about the security firm.
she tell you that?
Patty hewes connected frobisher to calder protective services when he was her plaintiff.
they also think a cop murdered david connor.
they suspect anyone in particular?
not that I know of.
look, what are we doing?
Ellen parsons is getting closer.
Ellen doesn't even know you exist.
take her out. - What?
make it look like an accident.
do it, and you're done.
Ortiz! You better get in here.
Hey, boss, it's Williams. We got a body.
and a murder weapon.
all right, nobody sing because we all know - Ellen hates singing! - Whatever, whatever 6 months earlier - But I love fudgie the whale - make a wish.
this next one is from your favorite aunt and uncle.
didn't anybody read the invitation?
Yeah, yeah, you and your "no gift" bullshit.
does anybody want anything?
Ellen - I'm okay.
David, we know you two are real busy.
a young lawyer with a fantastic new job and a dreamy doctor fiance?
Oh, the dreamiest.
you both work so much, you don't even have time to eat, plus you're saving your money to move into manhattan.
you got us an apartment?
so until Katie's restaurant opens.
Aw, dinner for two at the olive garden!
when you're there, you're family.
thank you Thank you.
Frobisher's lawyer calls three times a day.
he's just trying to intimidate you.
they just want you to sign the confidentiality agreement.
I hate these people.
when you see Patty tomorrow, she'll tell you how to handle them.
every time I close my eyes, I see saffron dead on my kitchen floor.
Patty thinks frobisher's an asshole, too.
the guy bankrupted 5, 000 of his employees.
I don't even care if I never step foot in my restaurant again.
Katie, we'll get through this. Okay?
the worst is over - El, your mom wants you to open up her present. - Okay - You guys okay? - Wait.
while I got you both here.
happy birthday, Ellen.
it's a little kitsch to add to your collection for your new apartment.
Thanks, honey, you're sweet - Do you like it - Beautiful.
want to see a lightning-rich black opal that'll knock your eyeballs out of their sockets?
look at this.
lightning-rich black, solid platinum.
top gem, world-class.
look at this, look at this, look at the colors in this thing.
Oh, my gosh, unreal.
okay, Patty, I get it, I get it.
I don't need to know what i don't need to know.
your advance for the next two weeks.
so consider me on call.
I'll just wait around to hear from you.
good luck with the frobisher clients - Has Ellen tried to contact you again? - No.
I like that she trusts you.
run into her again.
talk to her.
where?
the office.
I thought you want everyone to think I was fired.
all the more reason to stop by.
clear out your stuff, work the relationship.
page six. This morning's paper.
I went shopping yesterday, Arthur.
it's in there today.
no, thanks.
they're saying I spent $20, 000 on shoes while your former employees are lined up for food stamps.
Yeah, well, you know, you can't pay attention to this crap, Holly.
I spent $2, 000 and it was for the kids.
all right, all right, I'll have Ray Fiske make a call, see if we can get them to print a retraction.
then some shithead photographer chased us and hit my car, but I can't go to the police because that would just bring more press.
Bethie's friends won't come over.
their parents won't let them. Reporters are following her to school.
I know, I know, she told me.
this is not a childhood, Arthur.
you promised me that all of this would be over after the government trial.
look, there are things that are beyond my control. You know that.
I am trying to settle this case.
try harder.
I offered them $100 million for something i didn't do.
offer them more - Give them whatever they want - Okay.
how much? One billion? Two billion?
I'll tell you what.
why don't I give you the pen and you write the check?
you promised me, Arthur.
don't look at me like that, thank you, ricky, it looks fantastic.
I'll tell you what. Why don't you eat it, though, all right?
no, actually, come here, come here, come here.
you know what?
just pick the peppers out of this thing and give it to the dogs.
they'll love it.
we have the met gala on sunday and I don't want to be late, so be sure you're home from golf.
I'm doing everything I can to make this go away.
tuesday night is the helping hands auction.
I'm fine to go to that alone.
Holly, come on, don't do that.
and we have to make a decision about the aspen house.
are we going to keep building or are we going to sell it?
Holly, please.
what, Arthur? I heard you.
you're doing all that you can.
what do you want me to say?
nothing.
these are for msHewes' meeting with Kathryn Connor - Well, good morning - Morning.
your ears must have been ringing last night.
why is that?
I was talking about you.
really.
aren't you going to ask what I was saying?
well, I figured you'd tell me if you wanted me to know.
all good things, Ellen, all good things.
thank you.
there's a client meeting in ten minutes.
come sit in.
another week? What the hell are we talkingabout?
Frobisher offered us $100 million to settle and we voted to accept it.
nothing has been signed yet, mr Poplar.
but it was a done deal.
Larry, ms. Hewes thinks this witness can prove frobisher's guilt.
I don't want to lose that money.
Frobisher is praying that you settle. The money's going nowhere.
so what would you like from us?
time, Karen.
this new witness was in florida the same weekend as Arthur Frobisher.
if you give us another week, we can find out what this witness knows, and I believe it will give us leverage.
ms. Hewes, you really think this could be the smoking gun?
I'd like the opportunity to find out.
sorry to be a stickler for the rules, Art, but uncle sam has designated this environment smoke-free.
I called you because our young friend Katie Connor hasn't been to the restaurant in a week nor has she signed the new paperwork, which could spell disaster.
okay, Art, what do you want to talk about?
what happens if she leaves me?
I beg your pardon?
bottom line it for me, will you?
well, this is new york state, Art.
you'll write her a check for half of everything.
and the kids?
she's the sympathetic mother who runs three children's charities.
which I founded.
and you're a controversial father involved in a very public litigation to defend your reputation.
you need her, Art, now more than ever.
she's the one person who's remained loyal to you.
if she leaves now, we'll take a beating in the press.
all right, all right, let me ask and if we lose this, this Katie Connor, what happens?
if she doesn't sign the paperwork, it becomes a hell of a lot harder to destroy her credibility.
look, Art , the law is on our side.
the evidence is on our side.
on paper, this case is tighter than a bull's ass on fight night.
but if Patty hewes gets that girl in front of a jury all bets are off.
Hey. I'm here to see Patty Hewes.
welcome to hewes & associates.
how you feeling?
nervous.
come on back. Patty's running a few minutes late.
I'll show you my office - This place is incredible. - I know.
so, how many people are going to be in there?
just you, me and Patty.
we'll go through your florida timeline and make sure you're hitting all the details about that weekend.
I saw him two or three times that weekend.
that's fine.
Patty just wants to see if anything you can remember will contradict frobisher's testimony.
so, I can read it off my notes?
of course. It's not a test.
I'm in here - Another thing? - Yeah?
you look great. - Thanks.
I totally forgot to call you to ask you what to wear.
Ellen, Felicia wants to see the two of us - Okay - Now - Hang in there. I'll be back. - Sure.
we've bought ourselves more time.
the clients have agreed to give us another week.
Patty wants us to start prepping their testimonies, getting them to tell their stories.
why go poking at wounds now?
it'll make them want to settle even sooner.
Really?
anyone else want to weigh in?
I'm not sure.
not sure what?
I grew up with people like this.
a $100 million settlement sounds like a gold mine to them, and it's softening their resolve.
if you want them to turn it down,
I think you're right to remind them what they've been through, stir up their emotion - I could see the value in that. - Good.
divide them up. Each of you take a department.
Ellen, shadow andrew. See how we do it.
now?
the car's waiting downstairs to take you to newark.
is Patty leaving?
no, no, no, she's still meeting with you.
but I thought you were going to be there.
Patty'll take care of you.
Debra, could you look after ms. Connor, please?
you'll be great.
I'll call you when we're done.
you're a smart girl, Ellen, but you better watch your ass.
what?
Tom Shayes is gone.
when it came time to recruit, we each backed our own horse.
your boy tom bet on you.
he was the only one who stood to gain when you got the job.
what are you trying to tell me?
I'm trying to tell you, you should think twice before you shoot your mouth off - Andrew, Patty called on me - Yeah?
you think craig and Felicia care about that?
you don't show up your fellow associates, Ellen.
the only way you're going to make it here is with our support.
I was just answering a question.
I have no agenda.
well, maybe you better get one quick.
you're in Patty's good graces now because your friend's a witness, but that can change on a dime.
Olio santo from california?
unfiltered from tuscany?
I mean, it's damn ar impossible to decide.
the raging olive oil debate between giada de laurentiis and the barefoot contessa.
exactly.
last night's food network.
so, what is better?
virgin or extra virgin, or is it all just marketing bullshit?
it's about acidity.
an american or italian?
I love a little family-owned vineyard in greece - I'll write down their website for you - Oh, good.
I mean, it's expensive, but nothing like manhattan, though.
Ellen was checking out this apartment on 91st and riverside, and I asked her to get some stuff for a salad.
eight bucks for an organic tomato. Can you believe that?
great, Katie. Thanks.
thanks for coming by.
it was nice to meet you - We're finished? - Why?
something else you want to tell me?
no, no. I-I I just thought that we were going to look over the timeline.
Oh, I really don't see the point.
although, I did have one question.
how old were you?
I'm sorry?
I had just turned six.
when what?
when I realized I was a good liar.
how old wereou?
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.
your timeline?
I don't buy it.
so, right now you're going to do one of two things.
turn around and get the hell out of my office, - or tell me the truth - The truth?
ms. Hewes, I'm not lying - Katie, don't, don't.
it's me and you now. Ellen isn't here.
I don't understand.
I want the straight story, and until you tell me, you're worthless to me.
I don't give a shit about you.
wait. Ms. Hewes, please. I...
what aren't you telling me? - Nothing!
I put everything I know down here.
ms. Hewes, they want me to sign a new confidentiality agreement.
Yeah, I read it. It's very thorough.
well, what should I do?
do whatever you want to. Sign it.
these people are going to come after me again!
I thought that you were going to protect me.
until you stop lying, you're not my witness, and you're not my problem, please. Ms Hewes. Wait.
Hewes & associates. Can I help you?
we were told the girl lives here with her fianc?
have you questioned her? - Not yet.
the front door was chained, but not locked.
at approximately 9: 15 A. M,We force entry, and we find this.
the stereo's still there, tv.
so is the computer.
and most telling of all you come to loot a place, you don't leave something like that behind.
so, it wasn't a robbery.
watch yourself, lieu.
he was a good-looking.
so, what do you think?
she caught him screwing around?
I don't know what you're talking about.
you got to slow down - She's crazy! - Who?
Patty! She-she kicked me out of her office!
she told me to sign the confidentiality agreement.
I don't understand - I don't, either! - Ellen?
she's accusing me of lying, Ellen - About what? - Everything!
you read what I wrote. I'm not lying.
of course you're not lying.
well, then tell that to your boss.
you're the one who made me go in there.
look, what the hell am i supposed to do now?
Katie, just calm down. Go back to the apartment.
I'll be there as soon as I can. Okay?
Mr. Frobisher, the girl just met with Patty hewes.
ray Fiske wouldn't want me talking with you, but i can't believe our hands are just tied here.
you gave her a restaurant, mr. Frobisher.
what can we do to keep her quiet?
offer more money.
no, you can't do that.
the judge finds out, I could get nailed for witness tampering.
well, there's always a solution.
what kind of solution?
a permanent one what? Oh, god, no.
what, you think that I would...
it wouldn't get back to you.
Oh, we're-we're talking about a human life here.
Sh-She's an innocent girl. She didn't do anything.
she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
sometimes that's enough.
you're serious, aren't you? You're actually suggesting.
look, mrFrobisher, you're insulated, you have resources.
this kind of thing is simpler than you think.
so, how's that work? You know a guy? You make a call?
it's simpler than you think.
Yeah, of course it is.
you become powerful enough, eventually, every option gets presented to you, doesn't it?
Yes, sir.
one day, you're living your life.
the next thing you know, some man shows up on your doorstep and offers you the ultimate decision.
that's all it is, mr. Frobisher-- just another decision.
no. No.
you go down that road, and then, you know, who are you?
I mean, there's no going back.
no, no, no - Think about your family, mr. Frobisher - Don't tell me what.
this case is going to end with someone's life being destroyed.
why should it be yours?
you get what you needed?
Yup.
from the palm beach county P. D.
issued the morning of the frobisher event.
Katie's hiding details. She left it off her timeline.
a traffic ticket seems pretty insignificant.
her supervisor's kitchen report says she was right on time.
so, she managed to show up for work ten minutes before she was pulled over for running a red light?
find out more.
Fiske is making his move, trying to ruin her credibility.
there's something in this girl's past.
all right, I'm on it.
get me everything you can. Boyfriends, jobs, vices.
Yeah.
I want to know why she was late for the biggest day of her career.
you think Ellen knows the truth?
uh, it's too soon to tell.
anything else?
Yeah, here's the Ellen information we talked about.
are you sure you really want to do this?
make it happen.
go long, go long - Katie - I'm just grabbing my shit - Where have you been? - Thinking
why didn't you call me back?.
Katie, slow down.
tell me exactly what happened.
ask her.
I tried. She didn't call me back.
Ellen, I already told you, she's crazy.
she thinks I'm lying - About what? - I don't know.
I don't-- I don't know what she'd doing.
it doesn't make any sense.
I don't think she wants you to know.
why not?
because ten minutes before my meeting with her, she sent you away.
you think that's a coincidence?
come with me tomorrow.
we'll go in there together. We'll both talk to her.
I'm not going back the.
where are you going?
look, I have been living with you for a week.
this has gone on for long enough.
Ellen, I've got to get home.
I have got a life to live.
and I don't know anything about frobisher anyway.
take it easy - Get off - What?
Hello?
do it
Yes, sir.
Oh, shit.
that was intense.
Patty appreciates your involvement.
what's the girl's name?
do you have what we need?
Yeah.
here's everything.
the fianc?
he's in there, too.
my associates will look into it.
thank you.
nothing too excessive.
Patty's come to me before.
trust me.
I know how she wants it done.
don't hover in the door. I hate that.
what happened with Katie?
I spoke to her, msHewes. I don't believe she's lying.
Really? Why is that?
because she has no reason to.
don't be stupid, Ellen.
everyone's hiding something.
Really?
so what are you hiding?
I beg your pardon?
you didn't need me to meet with the clients yesterday.
you just wanted me out of the office, didn't you?
Yes.
so you lied to me?
what's your point?
why would you do that?
you already answered your own question.
I wanted to meet with Katie alone.
so you.
I manipulated you, yes.
well, I don't like being manipulated.
duly noted - Anything else? - Yeah.
you promised to protect Katie.
now she's totally confused. She has no idea what to do.
I have a temper, too, Ellen, but I've learned when to use it.
you were right.
she's using me.
of course she's using you, Ellen.
Patty hewes needs people who are driven.
she's tapping your energy and youth to further her own agenda.
which is?
you know what? It's highly unusual for us to be speaking like this.
you're no longer a summer associate of mine.
I know.
I offered you a job and you turned me down.
I didn't know who else talk to, mr Nye.
my advice to you, Ellen, is stop trying to figure Patty out.
you'll never change her, but she'll change you.
how?
by giving you access to how she thinks.
you signed up for this, now keep your head down and do the work.
that's why you're there, isn't it?
Yes.
then don't be shortsighted.
start using her.
learn everything you can, then get the hell out before it's too late.
how exactly will i know when that is?
that's for another walk.
Phil, there's another credit card charge.
you're going to have to be a little more specific than that, sweetheart $1, 200 for a place called frolic.
that's a gentlemen's club. I told you about it.
the singapore clients come to the city, they love that crap.
I can't drag them out of the champagne room.
fine, but this was last week and.
and I was in london.
I'll have a talk with michael.
what's an outcall?
Patty, I'll have a talk with him.
what is it?
he must've hired strippers.
hired them out?
you mean our son had them in our apartment?
maybe, maybe.
Michael's too smart for this bullshit and it's getting out of hand.
Jesus christ!
Patty, I'll handle this. You know, your plate is full.
just-- I'll take care of it, all right?
Yes.
I'll take care of this.
okay.
told you.
ten years. One box. One trip.
you didn't deserve this.
Thanks. I'll be okay.
I know I'm only here because of your support.
don't believe that for a second.
How're you doing? You okay?
I am - Really - Good. I'm glad
you know that friend you told me about in the stables?
did you ever, uh you ever tell Patty about her?
I guess we probably shouldn't discuss business.
sorry. You're right. You're absolutely right.
I got a cab waiting for me downstairs anyway.
you take care of yourself, Ellen - Thanks, tom - All right
I'll see you around.
Hey, are you following me?
I don't know what you're talking about?
you killed my dog. You killed my dog!
I don't you or your dog - Get away from me!.
lady, back off!.
stay away from me!
I am going to call the police - Screw you! - Are you okay?
screw you, asshole!
Jesus, mary, and joe cocker, what a fine surprise!
gentlemen, we do rise to our feet when a lady enters.
it's signed goddamn it!
that's wonderful news.
it's "all systems go" for your restaurant.
you got what you want. Just leave me alone!
and to think, for a reasonable fee, she's available to cater any occasion.
come on, god damn it
Yeah, where, where the hell have you been?
look, I just heard from Ray Fiske.
she signed the papers. Call it off?
we could do that right?
we can call it off?
no, yeah, but can we call it off?
answer my...god!
shit. God, hello. god damn it!
Oh, my god.
hi there, I'm Arthur.
I just came by to say hello.
I hear it's full steam ahead for the opening.
Oh, hey! My god, I love this.
MrFiske told me that you, uh, you signed our agreement.
you have no idea how grateful i am.
lawyers, right?
they make such a big deal over a little, a little red tape.
you and I, uh if I recall, god those are beautiful.
we never really spoke when we were down in florida, did we?
no, no, that's right - Yeah.
I don't mean to be rude, but i didn't even really remember who you were.
look, I'm not sure what.
but your meals! Oh, my god.
who could forget that?
well, it was kobe beef, fingerling.
mr Frobisher, I...
and just a sprinkle of - saffron - Right god that was great.
are gonna have that on the menu?
look, mr Frobisher, I'm, I'm gonna go now, but please you stay as long as.
no, no, I'm sorry. No, please, forgive me.
I just wanted to come by and say, say thank you.
isn't life great sometimes? I mean you, you and I we meet as total strangers at some boring luncheon down in florida, and the next thing you know we're, we're partners, making something absolutely beautiful.
our fates are intertwined, Katie.
isn't that remarkable?
I'm sorry to have bothered you. Thank you, Katie.
why did you call me?
because you're right.
I lied.
the day I cooked for frobisher.
so this was, um, about june 2002?
yeah Saturday morning the 19th,
I was rushing to work and got pulled over.
why didn't you put it in your timeline?
it's all so humiliating.
I met a guy down in florida, had a stupid one night stand.
it was a low point for me.
I was kind of a mess back then.
a guy. Whose name is.
I never got a last name.
we met friday night.
partied pretty hard and went back to his place.
he seemed like a genuinely nice guy.
sure.
then saturday morning I overslept.
which is why I was late, rushing to work, and why I got pulled over.
did you see him again?
no. But I got pregnant.
and it was the one night and, uh, I never even got his phone number.
and I just did what I had to do.
I'm sorry.
ms. Hewes, I swear this is the only thing I left out.
everything else is in there.
when did frobisher's people approach you?
Fiske called me, uh, about a week later, and said that Arthur frobisher liked my cooking and wanted to help me open a restaurant.
and what happened to Greg?
no idea.
ever since frobisher's been in the news, there's never been a connection.
I've never heard his name, never seen him, nothing.
you do understand why I lied to you, right?
Yeah.
then will you still be able to use me as a witness?
well, you and I will go over your timeline step by step.
hopefully, they'll be something that will impeach Frobisher's story.
but Kate you're stepping into the spotlight now.
details of your life are going to come out.
this kind of scrutiny is never easy for anyone.
I understand.
it's just my brother and Ellen don't know anything about this stuff.
you don't have to tell them, do you?
well, at some point the truth is gonna have to come out.
I'll let you decide when.
I spoke to Katie last night.
you're working, if it's a bad time I can.
no, no, uh. what did she say?
well you were right.
she's not hiding anything. I trust her.
but I want you to know that I had reasons for doing what I did.
when I read her confidentiality agreement, there was a section I found curious.
yeah?
ray Fiske had snuck in a medical release waiver.
Katie signed away access to her medical records?.
well, fiske must think that, um there's something in Katie's past that would destroy her credibility as a witness.
well, there isn't.
well, let's hope not.
meanwhile, she's given them everything they want, so - She's protected - Yes.
and you've had a very good first week.
what are these for?
a quiet, little place on the upper west side.
nice light, safe street.
I think you'll like it.
how did you.
Katie mentioned you were looking for an apartment.
Oh, I can't possibly accept, ms Hewes, I
please, please. You got a great bargain.
I did?
I know the head of the co-oboard.
Ellen, next time you need something, come to me - Hey - Hey.
been a long time.
Yeah.
I was, uh, a little surprised you called.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Greg, we need to talk.
about what?
Florida.
Owen, medium rare, rare?
medium rare.
here we go. Oh, yeah.
here you are.
that one right there.
Thanks, dad - Here you go, mom - Thank you.
looks pretty good.
all right, uh, who knows a joke? Anyone got a joke?
I do. Knock, knock.
who's there?
interrupting lawyer - Interrupting lawyer - I object!
not too bad.
not too bad, where'd you hear that one?
who wants chips? - I do.
we have salad.
I think Katie's lying about the guy she met in florida.
I think she's lying about a lot of things.
Katie Connor to see ms Hewes.
I thought you might use a friend.
for me?
Oh, my god, he's adorable.
he's a rescue.
Oh, thank you so much.
it's my pleasure no more secrets between us.
no more secrets.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
this place is ridiculous!
Oh, my god - It's too big!.
we'll get lost - This is amazing.
what's in here?
Oh,this is off the hook,look at this - Oh,my god - This is huge!
Oh,my god,patty even sent the welcoming committee.
this place is perfect.
Ellen, please.
help me to help you.
I mean, tell me what happened.
someone tried to kill me. -- Who?
4 MONTHS EARLIER
I'm sick of her shit.
that's right, Tomahawk, break the shackles. Take the power.
always identify your oppressor by name.
so who's shit are you sick of? -- Patty's.
say it loud!
and then she tells me I got to learn how to fall on my sword.
bullshit. You gave her every drop of blood and sweat.
pro and con 'em for me.
there were more pros. Trust me.
no, come on, seriously, make a list. This is important.
all right, all right.
if I take the Cutler job, I make more money, become a named partner.
uh, get equity stake in the firm, better benefits.
what are the cons?
nothing, Tomahawk.
look, listen, I understand.
okay, you've been with her ten years.
you want to respect spoken and unspoken commitments, but you got to forget that shit, all right? I can be objective here.
I'm on the outside looking in, and this bitch is jerking you around.
I know, I know.
right? Plain and simple.
Plus, she's high on this new associate, right?
you got to make Patty feel the sting.
the only way they ever let me run European at Lehman was by me stepping away.
I thought he said that he was grooming you for svp right out of b-school?
he said all kinds of stuff.
Tom, listen, with certain bosses, the Pattys of the world, the only way to earn their respect is to show them that you don't need them that you got somethg going on for yourself that's better than being at their beck and call.
I was gone one quarter, and Etrich would have swallowed broken glass to get me back.
he had to fork over a signing bonus of 13 million.
Really? -- That is what I'm talking about.
Jesus. -- Yeah.
so take the job at Cutler, and just devote yourself to it entirely, and give it time, all right?
and if Patty Hewes doesn't come after you...
Yeah, well, she was not going to make me a named partner anyway.
exactly, but at least you're in the driver's seat.
and handling the wheel's a beautiful thing. Trust me, it's win-win.
you're steering your own destiny.
right, definitely. You're right.
so, when are you going to break her heart and break the news?
tonight.
power.
good. That's it.
now, fluidity of motion.
that's it, right through. Fuse your mind and body.
right through your powerhouse.
breathe... -- Oh, shut up!
good, let it out. Just let it out.
accentuate the strength of your body.
that's it.
correct your weakness.
squeeze. Correct your imbalance.
And...we're done.
you're going to see Katie?
for how long? -- Couple days.
gonna leave after my shift.
and the hospital's okay for you to take time off work?
she's my sister. They have to be.
second shelf.
flight's still got some available seats if you're interested.
you know I can't leave work right now.
of course you can't.
David, don't do this.
what am I doing?
Katie lied in her deposition.
I am working 20-hour days trying to get Frobisher to pay for what he did.
baby, there are 5, 000 employees that need Patty to...
enough, okay? I've heard all of this before.
I'll call you when I land.
wait.
for the plane? We have to pick one.
what is it?
wedding bands.
no, Cocoa, don't eat that.
cocoa, don't eat that.
Oh, god. Leave me alone.
Hey, it's Katie. I'm going to be out of town for a while.
leave a message.
I just want to impress upon you that pulling a settlement now is a move where in tremendous risk may outweigh negligible reward.
Yeah, well, I didn't get to where I am by playing it safe, right, Ray?
and when you say, where I am, Art,
I can only assume you don't mean on trial for corporate malfeasance.
Hey.
look, all I'm saying is, putting your life in the hands of 12 strangers who most certainly will not be your peers is a dangerous proposition.
it's my job to protect you from that at all costs.
you ever play a team sport, Ray?
fencing.
no, I mean a team sport, like football.
you know, god I love that game.
I hate the way it's being micromanaged right now, but I love the sport.
the prevent defense. -- have you ever heard of that?
well, it's the strategy that you're advocating right now.
you roll it out when you're not really playing to win.
you're just playing not to lose.
I'm afraid you lost me there, Art.
Yeah, well, I would rath play straight man-to-man.
you know, blitz the shit out of them and take my chances.
chances. Look, just think of this as a small deductible on a $2 billion insurance policy.
well, that's easy for you to say, isn't it? 'Cause it's not your money.
or your reputation.
look, Katie Connor is gone now.
we get to trial, I can clear myself completely.
you know that girl's just one small piece of the puzzle.
and I'm worried the sun don't shine on the same dog's tail all week.
I have no idea what that means.
it means we got lucky.
this is my legacy.
I want my name back, goddamn it.
I want redemption.
look, I understand. - No, you don't.
you can't, Ray. You don't have kids.
I settle now, I admit guilt on the front page of every newspaper in the world, and that never goes away.
they'll write that on my tombstone.
Patty. -- Hey, Tom.
Hey, there, Tommy.
ray Fiske called.
he pulled the settlement off the table, which is exactly what we wanted.
I need to talk to you.
sit. Eat.
Phil's away. He never allows me to order this crap.
we have to finish everything. You have to hide all the evidence.
the dates checked out.
gregory Malina dumped his Frobisher stock the exact day Arthur Frobisher did.
interesting.
how did a waiter in the west village get the same inside information as a big CEO?
look at you.
two peas in a pod. It's a beautiful thing.
Fiske and Frobisher have no idea you're onto them, all thanks to little Ellen Parsons.
Ewah, but the one problem is, if we subpoena Gregory immediately...
Ellen will realize that we've known all along.
so let's just wait until she finds out about Gregory on her own.
what if she doesn't?
all right, we'll deal with it. I mean, she's just not our priority.
in the meantime, Tom, I want you to keep digging...
no. -- No?
is there a problem?
Yeah, there is a problem.
martin Cutler extended himself. He made an offer.
it's a good one. -- Congratulations.
look, I'm not here to negotiate, Patty.
he offered to make me a partner.
named partner.
Plus, a signing bonus.
I'd fight to keep you, Tom...
and a base of 950 grand.
I don't think it would be in your best interest.
Cutler's offering to make you a named partner?
you have that in writing?
along with all the other points.
sounds like the deal of a lifetime.
Deb must be thrilled. -- Absolutely.
you know, do me a favor, when the checks start rolling in, don't just save up.
spend some on yourself. I know how hard you work.
you deserve to enjoy it. -- Patty, I want you to know buy Deb that house by the lake that she wants.
put in a real fire pit.
don't forget to invite me over.
I appreciate all you've done for me.
I mean, Martin's got a much bigger shop over there, Tom.
incredible room for movement. Don't give it another moment's thought.
I just wish I could top his offe would you like a beer, Tommy?
no. I,uh...
I can't stay.
walking out of your own last supper?
Hey.
you pulled the settlement. I thought we were going to work this out.
Oh, we've still got a long road ahead of us.
win or lose, you'll be taken care of. -- Don't worry about it.
I'm not just in this for myself, I work with those people. They're friends.
and I tried to be fair with them, didn't I? -- I know.
I don't know what to say. You know, I'm --I'm innocent.
my wife's got diabetes, Mr. Frobisher. I've got a mortgage, medical bills.
I'm sorry. Look, you have...
you've really come through for me. So even if this even if this gets to a trial, if we don't settle, your cooperation has been invaluable. I want you to know that.
this is what I want to do, I want to double our arrangement.
okay? -- Yeah.
you may need to do a few more things for me.
like what?
she pleaded with us for time to find a witness.
we gave her a shot, and she blew it.
the witness lied. It's not her fault.
regardless. That hundred million, gone.
we got nothing.
Patty Hewes is useless to us.
so what are you saying?
fire her. Cut out the cancer.
could we please not smoke?
we're not smoking. I'm smoking.
if you're smoking, I'm smoking.
anybody else got a problem here? -- Larry, don't do this.
okay, I'll join you for one outside in ten minutes.
can't even find my goddamn lighter.
we picked Ms. Hewes for a reason. She's the best.
she said there'd be some setbacks.
we knew there were going to be some ups and downs.
where the hell are the ups, Karen?
you're a gambler. You don't change your horse mid-race, do you?
if it's pulling up lame, I do, then I shoot him.
Oh, Jesus.
two right in the head real quick, problem solved.
all right, look, we need a consensus.
and for that, we may need to compromise.
you got any bright ideas, kid?
Yeah, actually. I do.
what if I gave you a plant?
would Ms. Hewes have a problem with that in the office?
I mean, how can you say no to a plant?
how's your Pad Thai?
Oh, it's delicious.
now, does that name refer to the noodles or the sauce?
um, I think it's the whole dish.
so, how's it all been going?
what? -- What?
she asks me. The wedding planning?
Oh, great. We had our first fight.
did he leave angry?
you can't let that happen, El.
you and David need to take some time together. You're both so busy.
mom, there is no time.
this is your future husband. You need to make time.
talk to Ms. Hewes. I'm sure she'll understand.
Yeah, I'll talk to Patty.
so, shall we try on the dress?
great.
I did the resizing.
did I tell you about the scandal?
what scandal? -- At the church.
try the dress and I'll tell you.
so you know about the second service adding on Sundays?
dad told me.
well, apparently the idea is to attract younger members.
so instead of having a traditional choir, they're going to play rock and roll music.
the pastor asked your sister to help put together a band.
she's finally going to be a rock star. Can you believe that?
what's the matter?
you don't want to wear my dress?
I'm really glad you're here.
Oh, me, too, baby.
me, too.
we've come to you as a united front because we think it's time.
for what?
a month ago, you fired Tom.
don't tell me a story. Tell me what you want.
appoint a new second chair.
since Tom's left, there's been a leadership vacuum.
Felicia and I have discussed it at length.
and we'd like to know if you're amenable to us sharing the position.
I'm not.
my second chair is indispensable to me.
that person is my eyes and ears. The job is all consuming.
I'll appoint one when someone's earned it.
but... -- Yes?
I'm sorry, Ms. Hewes.
Karen, what happened? What's wrong?
I voted against it.
voted against what?
firing you.
the group hired another attorney to represent us.
who?
we want you to know, this isn't a decision we take lightly, b...
we lost confidence in Patty Hewes.
all she's done is make promises she can't keep.
she never even consulted us when she fired you.
and you know the case better than anyone.
we called because we trust you.
well, thank you. Thank you, I,uh...
I appreciate that.
but you should know, at this point, um, any change in representation is a risk.
it could signal weakness to the other side.
we're already weak.
Yeah, the settlement's gone.
our key witness was a bust. -- You want the job or not?
Yes, I do. A hundred percent.
and, uh, to be honest, I,uh... Well, it couldn't come at a better time.
you at a new firm now, or what?
Yeah, I'm currently weighing an offer, but with this opportunity, I need to reevaluate.
I think it might be best for you all if I go out on my own.
I don't think your case should be compromised by anyone else's agenda.
what's the name of this new guy?
this trial's going to be like a cakewalk.
this ain't his first rodeo, Art.
he graduated Yale law and went straight to Rehnquist's office.
Patty handpicked and groomed him.
she wouldn't be where she is today without him.
why are you bringing me down like this? We're having a nice lunch.
don't get me wrong, we have an opportunity here.
but whoever is on the other side in that courtroom, it's the jury you've got to worry about.
what opportunity?
Tom's going to want a quick score to cement his reputation.
now, I think we can get him to bite on a settlement figure.
why the hell would I want to do that?
I just pulled a hundred million off the table.
what if I could get Tom to agree to 75?
why would he do that?
Patty Hewes couldn't wi so there's no shame in settling.
Shayes gets credit for cleaning up Patty's mess and you get off dirt cheap.
man, I've eaten too much.
think about it, Art.
quite certainly a welcome break in the weather to see you.
how's the view from the first chair?
I could get used to it.
well, it suits you fine.
it's going to be a challenge to tackle this all by your lonesome, don't you think?
word on the street says Martin Cutler's made you a generous offer.
well, right now my priority's with the clients.
I'm not sure if Cutler's the right fit for them.
I see.
can I have Kitty rustle up a beverage for you?
a sparkling water or...do you prefer something more potent?
not during billable hours, Ray.
Oh, a regular Atticus Finch. Suit yourself.
well, as I'm sure you know, Mr. Frobisher's withdrawn his generous offer.
so I gather.
and not to tell tales out of school, but my client's a stubborn man --Mule stubborn.
once he gets a notion, it's got.
well, I appreciate that.
I'm not an unreasonable man, Tom.
I assume you wouldn't be here unless you had something to offer.
maybe now that your illustrious predecessor's out of the picture, reasonable minds can prevail.
I don't see why not.
well, good.
so throw me out a number, Tom.
let's see if I can get that old mule to back up.
well, I'm not Patty Hewes, Ray.
well, thank Jesus for that.
but I did spend ten years with her, and there's no number that I'll accept.
want to go to trial.
I want to put your multibillion dollar pros boy for corporate corruption in front of a jury and watch you try to explain to them that he's not a crook.
Hey, Tomahawk.
she couldn't be more than 23.
well, that's four years older than the last one.
the witch is dead.
ding-dong. Welcome to your new life.
Ah, Deb, gorgeous as ever.
Oh, you're sweet.
this is Keira.
Hey, what'd you do? Did you change something?
haircut, lose some weight, or -- Oh, I know what it is.
the size of these things.
you should feel these. He's a regular Earl Anthony over here.
that's okay. Trust me.
all right, we're ready. Thanks, baby.
I had her ice 'em up for us.
grand Siecle?
plenty more where that came from. Here you go.
thank you, thank you.
an indentured servant no more.
anyone ever tell you you look like Tom Cruise?
no. No, they haven't.
what's the matter?
nothing, just, uh, tough week.
well, maybe that's what I'm here for tell me about it?
what are you drinking?
I keep thinking maybe someday I'll just...I'll wake up and I'll realize something's missing, but right now, shit, you know, I turn to this one and I say, baby, pinch my dick.
is it po --is it possible for life to be perfect?
no.
what's that?
nothing
so she didn't fight for you, Tommy. So what?
you know? - Yeah.
Cutler's still wet in the panties for you and, more importantly, regardless you areyour own man.
you can take this Cutler offer and parlay it into five more.
Shayes, the world is your oyster, man.
I'm gonna, um...I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
you good? -- Yeah, yeah, I'm just...
what the hell are you doing to yourself?
Oh, I'm, I'm drunk.
Yeah, well...I can see that.
what are you --What, what are you doing here?
you are in the opportunity of a lifetime and you act like you're grieving.
getting out from under my shadow was the best thing that could ever happen to you.
you didn't, you didn't even fight to keep me.
you have more talent, more raw potential than any attorney I have ever worked with.
well, you, you never to me that before.
letting you leave is the only way to get you to realize it.
you're your own man, Tom.
it's time you stand on your own two feet and walk away.
you can be better than me.
S-sweetie, sweetie, are you okay?
sweetie, talk to me.
I feel bad. -- Yeah?
my apartment's right up here.
how convenient.
move, move, move.
easy, easy, fellas. It's okay, it's okay.
they just, they just want some money.
Hey, h-hold on.
shit.
you guys are going to have to find somebody else.
enough.
enough.
why are you so stupid?
what the hell do you want?
I did everything you told me to do.
we didn't tell you to call Katie Connor.
I burned her as a witness. It's done.
you hear me? I'm done.
you should be so lucky.
if Katie Connor decides to talk, you' be the center of this whole case.
Patty Hewes will be lookin to depose you now, we need to know: Can we count on your cooperation?
how was your flight?
fine.
dad driving you crazy yet?
they're both tiptoeing around me.
what have you told them?
the short version.
mom said not to worry about losing the restaurant, dad told me the story about not making varsity the first time around.
I haven't heard that one in a while.
how's my lawyer friend?
she wanted to come.
but she's stuck up Patty's ass and couldn't make it.
you guys found a new caterer for the wedding yet?
Katie, how long are you guys going to be mad at each other?
is that why you're here?
to referee?
she feels bad about what happened.
does she? -- Of course.
how's the case going anyway?
as far as I can tell, it's not good.
all hell's breaking loose, but you know what?
honestly, I don't really care about that right now.
good, 'cause they're not going to win that thing.
why not?
because of Frobisher.
because he controls everyone.
for all I know, you're on his freaking payroll.
you have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
no. Tell me.
the truth doesn't even matter anymore.
you can't accuse mom and dad of tiptoeing and then shut me out when I'm trying to talk to you.
you'll have to hear details about your sister's sordid sex life.
I think I can handle at.
So...congratulations.
you know that the clients came to me, right?
I know. -- I didn't, I didn't poach them.
I know, but... -- Okay.
I still don't think Patty would condone us doing this.
Oh, us talking?
andrew told me that you might be joining Martin Cutler's firm.
Yeah, well, the truth is...
since the clients have come to me, I'm thinking about going out on my own, which is why i wanted to talk to you.
you're getting to know the case really well.
I'm sure you heard that Katie didn't pan out as a witness.
Yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm sorry about that.
it turns out what you said at the stables was right, though.
Patty's kept me around even though she lost Katie as a witness.
I'm sure you're there because you're doing excellent work, which is why I'd love for you to join me.
I need somebody I can trust and you'd make a valuable addition to the team.
I'm flattered...
but you don't need me, Tom.
you think maybe you're just trying to get back at Patty?
take what's hers?
the Frobisher case is an excellent opportunity.
Patty took a chance on me.
I owe it to her to stick around.
all right, I get it. I understand.
you're still new.
you want Patty's approval.
just don'tet it stay that way forever.
Hey, there she is!
how was visiting day?
there are three other girls who play the saxophone.
Really? --And the music teacher said she used to play with Bruce Springsteen.
she loved it, huh?
Yeah, they all do. Martin.
place was voted best school spirit in new york magazine three years running, hmm?
well, listen, thanks for your help in getting her in.
Yeah, look, I...I didn't do this from the kindness of my heart, Tom.
I know.
so, I,uh...I hear you picked up Patty's clients in the Frobisher case.
I've been meaning to talk to you, yeah.
look, look, uh, I'm not going to pretend that this doesn't give you more leverage, and I'm willing to renegotiate, but I hope to shit you're not thinking about going out on your own.
the thought's crossed my mind, Martin.
well, you could fight that case for another two years, and get nothing, Tom.
got to go.
I'm putting a clock on my offer.
you got till the end of the day.
I want an answer in the morning.
Yes, I'm Alice. You be everyone else.
all right, okay.
uh, how do you like the queen?
not at all.
she's so eremely likely to win that it's hardly worth finishing the game.
how impertinent!
Oh, I'm going to chop your head right off!
I am, I'm chopping it. That's it.
I've got a hatchet.
uh, it's Patty. She's outside. She wants to talk to you.
if I had to lose the clients, I'm glad I lost them to you.
Patty.
I mean it, Tom.
So...you must have a lot of options now.
it's an exciting time.
deciding whether to go with Cutler or strike out on your own?
Yeah, I'm weighing things.
well, if you ever want to talk strategy, bounce around some ideas, I'm all yours.
no strings attached.
very generous.
the case is all about Gregory Malina now.
he's linked to Frobisher somehow.
find out who's giving him orders.
I will. I will.
why did you become a lawyer, Tom?
I've told you before. There are a lot of reasons.
look, Patty, look, whatever you're trying to do here... -- I know exactly why I did.
because of your father.
I don't give a shit about changing the world.
but I hate bullies.
look, I'm sorry that you had to go through that.
made me who I am.
you're a great number two, Tom.
you always were.
you always told me the truth.
it's going to be difficult without you.
well, Andrew's capable, and, uh, Felicia. Give her a couple months.
it's a huge difference between being number one and being number two.
Yes. There is.
you're a number two, Tom.
that's your talent. That's your limit.
this is what yocameu here to tell me? -- No.
I came because I care about the clients.
I only want what's best for them.
take them to Cutler.
Oh, Jesus.
you'll drown out there on your own, Tom.
I don't want the clients drowning with you.
you can't do it. -- Patty!
you're not ready.
you're in the optimal negotiating position. All right?
you're in the goddamn catbird seat. You got options, champ. You got...Cutler. You got Hewes.
you could go out on your own.
thank you, baby. Here, this is for you.
do not divvy it up amongst the others, okay?
just keep it in your pocket.
look, you just got to pull the trigger.
you know what I have chiseled on a slab in my office?
Audentes Fortuna Iuvat.
fortune favors the bold.
that's right. That's right.
and why are all these clients falling into your lap?
because that is fortune, baby, and right now, she is favoring you.
the world's made up of all kinds of people, and that is a good thing, but if you're ally sitting on the fence with this, if you need advice, maybe you're not the guy.
the guy for what?
I'm incredibly selfish.
I do things the way I want. Okay?
and I'm greedy, and it's a blessing, and it's also a curse.
there's no law that says you have to be me.
so, what-what are you saying?
I'm saying what we both know, man.
you want to work for Patty Hewes.
Patty Hewes damn well better make you a named partner.
next time I see you, Hewes & Shayes better be on that door.
it's early.
Yes, it is.
so, you have your negotiating points?
there's no room to negotiate here.
Yes.
partner.
I just spoke to the clients. -- Really?
what did you say?
I told them that no one will fight for them like you.
and if they left you, it would be the biggest mistake of their lives.
And?
and they're willing to come back.
thank you, Tom.
Yes.
no. No name on the door.
it's still Hewes & Associates.
see you at 9: 00.
you're back.
is that your mom on the couch?
Yeah. Wedding planning went a little long.
how did it go?
good. She's pushing for my cousin's band.
we need to gang up on her.
I'll be glad to.
how was yourrip? How's Katie?
she's hanging in there.
babe, I'm so sorry. I was wrong.
I should have come with you.
it's okay.
no, it isn't.
I've been taking you for granted, and the last thing I want is for my job to come between us.
well, I would be apologizing to you.
what for?
I think this case is even more complicated than you think.
Katie told me a few things.
turns out, Katie lied in her deposition because of this asshole.
her one-night stand in Florida?
he set Katie up to perjure herself.
but Katie told me she never saw him again after that night in Florida.
she lied. She started seeing him again a few weeks ago.
his name's Gregory Malina.
I suggest we subpoena him.
well, put it together ASAP.
good work, Ellen.
Tom! Glad to have you back.
someone tried to kill her?
that's right.
and, uh, where is this body?
Patty Hewes' apartment.
Hey, sweety buy but I guess I won't be needing this anymore.
what happened?
I told her I was sick of her bullshit.
you what?
Ellen, you're a first-year associate.
when patty was my age, do you think she would have tolerated a boss like her?
no.
then why should I?
was this about the case?
sort of.
I uncovered some evidence on my own...
but patty was more interested in putting me in my place than what I found.
I see, mm-hmm.
she says it's all about the case, but it's not.
it's about her and her mind games.
Yes.
I want the clients to win their case, but...
I'm not going to be patty's punching bag.
Oh, you'll bounce back.
which is why I'm here, mr. Nye.
I need a job.
the law will always be here, ellen.
but, um, your wedding is coming up, isn't it?
Yes.
you know, I made similar mistakes early in my career.
never took a honeymoon.
don't let your life pass you by.
babe, this is a nightmare.
what is?
the seating arrangement.
it's more complicated than the bar exam.
can I sit your cousin jake next to heather?
why are you always trying to pimp heather out, huh?
I just thought, you know, they both...
they both love hiking...
and narcotics.
they have lots to talk about.
how'd it go with nye?
he wouldn't give me a job.
he told me to take a vacation.
I love this man.
all right, I will see you later.
okay? - Okay.
Hello, david.
may I come in?
do you want to call me later?
Yeah. I will.
I was wondering when you would show up.
you impressed me with this.
I wasn't trying to.
just take the information and use it.
it's all very intriguing, but how does it help our case?
george moore was heading up the sec investigation into frobisher's company, but according to a former sec investigator...
Laura watkins.
I met with her.
she believed that moore was making a big show of wanting to take down frobisher, but behind the scenes he was torpedoing the investigation.
and all the rest of this
the hotel records, the rental car receipts, a flight manifest...
all show that george moore was in jacksonville, florida the weekend before frobisher sold his stock.
Moore drove down to palm beach to tip off frobisher.
it's a nice theory.
no proof.
use it anyway.
put pressure on moore.
to do what?
get frobisher to settle.
I could never understand why moore leaked arlington, but now it makes perfect sense.
he must be afraid of what would come out in a trial.
Moore wants the whole case to go away, and if he knows that you're closing in on him...
he'll give us more dirt we can use against frobisher.
so...
we need to go back to moore.
I think so.
and you're the only lawyer in my firm he'll talk to.
it's a nice apartment.
isn't it?
go back to moore.
and...
of course you can have your job back.
I don't want it.
but I'll talk to moore.
I want you to win this case.
our court date-- six weeks, folks.
Tom's running point, so if he needs you to do something, do it.
exhibits, witness prep.
it is deadline time.
Felicia, do you have the expert list?
you'll get it tomorrow.
that's it.
make your mothers proud.
where was ellen this morning? - I don't know.
maybe she wasn't feeling well.
Tom, half the office saw her storm out the other day.
did patty fire her?
just focus on the case.
everyone's talking about it.
what are we supposed to tell them? - Whatever you want.
tell them ellen's dead.
just get me the goddamn expert list.
I hope she was fired.
I never liked her.
Hey.
what are you doing here?
I thought you could use some lunch.
what do we got here?
a nice filet, some asparagus, and some blackberry cobbler.
sweetie, this is stupendous.
I finished my meetings this morning, and i just realized how much I missed you.
I know, I know, I'm sorry.
this case has just taken over my life.
they all do, ray, but this one...
this one's different.
I worry about you.
you're so quiet these days.
what?
you never accused me of that before.
well, it's true.
soon as the case is over, I'll be a regular ol' chatterbox again.
well, that'll be nice.
we'll take a few days, go see your sister in tacoma.
I'll believe that when I see it.
I promise.
sit, sit, eat.
Oh, that smells good.
200251
more wine?
why not?
we're going to be closing soon, so...
looks like I'm your last customer.
I suppose I just lost track of the time.
you're always coming in here with work. What do you do?
I'm an attorney.
you know, I don't believe I've ever caught your name.
ray.
a blackout?
you were probably still in kindergarten.
this was 1977, the very first week I arrived.
an auspicious debut. Shit.
guess when I got here.
when?
last september.
you don't say. Yeah.
before or after?
just before.
it almost made my change my mind, but then I thought...
if I leave now...
they win. Right.
I probably should have left, though.
Why's that?
I don't know, I...
I just can'T...
get going, you know?
I live in a shithole, and i barely make enough to pay my rent.
why did you decide to move here in the first place?
I'll try anything once, I guess.
Oh, I'm sorry.
that's my wife.
you're married?
never seen her; you never bring her in.
Oh, I come in here to work, clear my head.
you like being an attorney?
I like the relationship between attorney and client.
there's an intimacy there, a trust.
someone puts himself in your hands.
and you like that.
I do.
what the hell are you doing here?
Oh, uh, a couple downstairs said the ceiling was dripping.
just, um...
checking for a leak.
and the lamp?
noticed a bulb was out.
does ellen know that you're here?
no.
Patty hewes told me to extra special care of you.
next time, you call me.
don't ever do this again.
6 DAYS LATER
you have 57 new messages.
Patty, it's tom.
it's tom.
I'm in rome now. I'm worried about you...
it's tom...
Yeah, mom, I'm up at henry'S. Everything's fine...
I don't know how to tell you this.
I just got a call from hollis nye.
somehow, ellen's in jail.
I don't know how to tell you this.
I just got a call from hollis nye.
somehow, ellen's in jail.
she was arrested for killing david.
how was sawgrass?
I'm sorry?
did you hit the green on 17 or end up in the drink?
depends on when you're talking about.
june, 2002.
you were in jacksonville, florida the weekend before frobisher dumped his stock.
Ah, yes.
I hit the green.
I'm sure you did.
then you drove four hours to palm beach and tipped off frobisher that the sec was about to release a report damning his company's finances.
Frobisher give you a nice kickback?
I was trying to prosecute arthur frobisher.
not according to laura watkins.
look, I don't know what you think...
I think you want this case to be over, and i think that we can help each other.
give us something on frobisher.
and if I don't?
then patty hewes starts looking into you.
your finances, your investments, your bank accounts
anything you have hidden, she'll find it.
I told you, I can't give you frobisher.
but I can give you somebody.
who?
same time, tomorrow night, meet me here.
I'll bring you a present.
Jesus...
you scared me.
you're so cute when you think you're alone. Yeah?
Ugh, I'm living life in reverse.
first breakfast then bed.
what's that?
it's our first wedding gift.
don't get too excited, though. It's from aunt marge and uncle fran.
a garden gnome?
we live in an apartment.
thank god your family has some taste.
what did patty have to say?
she offered me my job back.
what did you say?
I said no.
good.
I don't like having her in our lives.
neither do I.
you want breakfast? - Sure
Aw, no.
who is it?
don't answer it.
but this is the third time she's called this week.
well, we need do something.
we need to talk.
how did it go with judge toomey?
Patty, when are you going to announce ellen's firing?
I'm-I'm-I'm running around the office, avoiding people's questions...
And?
and I'm a partner now, and I need you to treat me like one.
if you have plans for ellen, i need to know them.
there are no plans.
then you should tell the associates that.
Ellen approached a key informant without our knowledge, and she was fired.
people should know that.
go announce it.
thank you.
you're right, you're a partner, i should start treating you like one.
goddamn it, gregory, you had one task.
one task, and you screwed it up.
how was I supposed to know the guy was gonna show up early?
you shouldn't have been in the condo in the first place.
you were supposed to rent it, leave the key, and take a goddamn vacation.
I'm sorry, ray.
but I'm telling you, the girl didn't see anything.
the important thing now is for you to say nothing.
you just forget any of this ever happened, understand?
Yes, I understand.
look, I'm sorry for raising my voice at you...
it's my fault.
I-I screwed up.
I'm the one who sent you down there.
listen.
that gift I gave you, for going down there...
the stock.
do yourself a favor.
sell it tomorrow.
give me a double scotch.
do you believe this?
I'm staying in a hotel room.
I can't be in that house anymore.
you better get me the best goddamn divorce attorney in this city.
of course.
one battle at a time.
thank you, that's enough.
we were right.
about what?
he sold you out.
Arlington...
gregory malina...
it's all him.
so you're meeting with moore again?
Yeah.
he won't give up frobisher, but he's going to give us someone else.
you've got him desperate.
he's trying to make the case go away before it closes in on him.
if moore tipped off frobisher, that's a crime.
why shouldn't we just go after him for that?
because our clients come first.
criminal charges would take precedence.
our case could get pushed another three years.
we'll get there, ellen...
once step at a time.
here.
what's this?
it should hold you over for a few weeks.
I'm not doing this for money.
I know you're not, but take it.
don't be foolish, ellen.
everyone needs to eat.
mom? Yeah.
Oh, hey.
sorry to interrupt.
Michael, this is ellen parsons.
Hi.
nice to meet you, michael.
Yeah, cool.
are you using the car tonight?
me, henry and julius are going to head to foxwoods.
to the casino?
you can't get in.
mom... fake ids?
you guys have a nice night.
she's kind of hot.
where the hell have you been? I've been waiting for over...
are you sure you're all right?
I'm fine.
here.
I'm sorry you went through that.
I hate these people.
photos link ray fiske to gregory malina, and the documents prove that fiske's guilty of insider trading.
you should be able to use that.
it's blackmail, ellen.
just do what needs to be done.
so mr. Frobisher offered $500 million to settle, and patty hewes turned it down.
at that price, this case should be over.
she's overplaying her hand.
gone and convinced herself that arthur's outburst in that deposition room will be worth more to a jury than it actually is.
my grandfather adored you, ray.
I'm told people thought you were his son.
he was a fine man, an even better mentor.
he'd be tickled pink to see what you've made of yourself, marshall.
we all have the utmost respect here for you, ray.
we truly do.
so I... I won't mince words.
the senior partners have lost confidence in your ability to effectively try this case.
you've got to be kidding me.
and as you know, mr. Frobisher's case bears enormous consequence to the future well-being of this firm.
the partners want me to shadow you from here on out.
you'll consult me on any and all tactical decisions as we move to trial.
look, arthur frobisher is a stubborn man.
stubborn and complicated.
there are complexities to the case that are beyond the normal scope of...
Marshall, I'm sorry, no offense, but I'm going to have to talk this over with amos.
it's been decided.
I'll be looking over your shoulder every step of the way, so...
you'll turn over everything you've got, get me up to speed by the end of the week.
what do you have there, girl?
let me see.
come on.
come on, girl, open up.
don't you just love dogs?
Yeah.
they're like people.
only without the bullshit.
go play, girl, go.
client reps rethink the offer?
what's this?
it's our counter.
the wealthy patron who paid gregory malina's way down to florida,
I'm guessing it was you, ray.
Where'd you get these?
does it matter?
they're just pictures, patty.
they don't mean... anything.
read the document.
you transferred stock to gregory malina, then told him to sell using information you got from your client.
I don't give a shit about your private life, ray.
but I can't sit on this kind of information. - Patty...
unless you and I come to some arrangement.
there is no way frobisher is going to offer you a better settlement.
I don't want one.
this case is going to be tried in a courtroom.
I am not tanking my own case at trial.
think about it, ray.
take your time.
I don't have to think about it.
Frobisher's my client.
and my friend.
we wouldn't be having this conversation if gregory malina were still alive.
you're a baptist, right, ray?
repent.
thank you.
Mr. Phillips wants to sit down with you later.
I'll be here.
I think we just got our second wedding gift.
Really? Yeah.
it's probably from aunt barbara.
she told me she ordered something online last week.
okay, hang on, mom.
hang on. I'll open it.
you know, - Hang on.
ordering gifts on the internet is not as easy as people say.
I tried to find your name on the registry page, but there were six ellen parsons in new york alone.
anyway, you know this means you're going to have to start sending thank you notes.
Oh, my god.
what?
who would send this?
what is it?
honey, what is it?
I miss you David Love Lila
Hey, ellen?
what's going on?
Yeah, do you still have lila dimeo's phone number?
Yeah, I think.
Hey, there, it's lila.
sorry, I'm not around, but i bet ya know what to do and when to do it.
this is ellen parsons.
stay away from my fianc?
or i swear to god I will come after you, you crazy bitch.
2 DAYS LATER
we're done, ellen.
Hello?
Li... stop, stop it.
just stop. Listen to me.
damn it, will you just-- no!
Lila, you need to stop calling me!
that was, uh...
that was great, ray.
thanks for dinner.
had to celebrate your new job. - Yeah.
july 2002
it's gonna feel strange going to work in a suit.
looks good on you.
Thanks.
what is it?
we can't be in contact anymore.
why not?
looks like the government is charging my client.
I... I don't know anything.
you know enough.
we can't be seen together.
okay.
I'm gonna miss you, gregory.
I'll miss you too, ray.
what?
what is it?
no, ray... - Gregory, please.
please...
no, ray, come on. That'S...
that's not who I am.
I don't believe you.
please.
Jesus, ray!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, ray.
I'm sorry. I...
what is it, ray?
george moore is dead.
I heard.
I got a letter...
from gregory malina. - When?
it's over, art.
what is?
it's over.
ray, what's over?
ray, what the hell are you talking ab...
Hey.
what time is it?
did you eat?
there's some grilled salmon in the fridge.
first thing in the morning...
we have to leave.
to go where, my sister's? - No...
we have to get out of the country.
I don't understand.
I'll explain everything tomorrow.
right now I need you to pack our things.
ray, you have to tell me what...
you have to trust me.
will you do that?
yes...
Yes, of course.
okay.
I have a few things I have to take care of.
you got my message?
I did.
Yeah, so...
I've been mulling things over.
I'd like to sit down with you, see how we can work this out.
I'm glad to hear it, ray.
we can get together first thing in the morning.
I'd prefer sooner.
I don't want this hanging over me, you understand?
of course.
what are you doing later tonight?
I can be anywhere you want me to be.
Yeah, it was the first movie I saw in, like, four months where I actually stayed awake.
OK -Yeah
okay, babe. I love you
love
hey there, ray.
Hello, patty.
you want a drink?
Thanks, no.
well, sit.
how you holding up?
I've been better.
did I ever tell you why I became a lawyer, ray?
no, you never told me.
I thought I could change the world.
silly, huh?
I just liked getting to wear a tie every day.
you and I are two sides of the same coin.
how's that?
we love the game.
another case, a bigger win.
it's an addiction like any other.
you're blackmailing me, patty.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
long as we're clear.
Frobisher is guilty, ray.
help me set things right.
you're a friend.
we bring out the best in each other.
after this, we have a hundred more rounds to go.
I don't see how that's possible.
I am not looking to destroy you.
we attorneys survive.
it's the clients that come and go.
I can't go into a courtroom...
and deliberately lose my case.
I know it will be painful, ray.
but six months, a year from now, it'll all blow over, and you'll come work with me.
I'm serious.
you would do that?
hire the finest goddamn litigator I've ever come up against?
Yes, ray.
Absolutely.
there's a place for you here.
it's win-win, for both of us.
okay, patty.
good, ray.
I'm glad.
you know...
I always wanted to work with you, patty.
not anymore.
thanks for the advice...
but I guess I won't be needing this anymore.
what happened?
I told her I was sick of her bullshit.
you what?
Ellen, you're a first-year associate.
when patty was my age, do you think she would have tolerated a boss like her?
no.
then why should I?
was this about the case?
sort of.
I uncovered some evidence on my own...
but patty was more interested in putting me in my place than what I found.
I see, mm-hmm.
she says it's all about the case, but it's not.
it's about her and her mind games.
Yes.
I want the clients to win their case, but...
I'm not going to be patty's punching bag.
Oh, you'll bounce back.
which is why I'm here, mr. Nye.
I need a job.
the law will always be here, ellen.
but, um, your wedding is coming up, isn't it?
Yes.
you know, I made similar mistakes early in my career.
never took a honeymoon.
don't let your life pass you by.
babe, this is a nightmare.
what is?
the seating arrangement.
it's more complicated than the bar exam.
can I sit your cousin jake next to heather?
why are you always trying to pimp heather out, huh?
I just thought, you know, they both...
they both love hiking...
and narcotics.
they have lots to talk about.
how'd it go with nye?
he wouldn't give me a job.
he told me to take a vacation.
I love this man.
all right, I will see you later.
okay? - Okay.
Hello, david.
may I come in?
do you want to call me later?
Yeah. I will.
I was wondering when you would show up.
you impressed me with this.
I wasn't trying to.
just take the information and use it.
it's all very intriguing, but how does it help our case?
george moore was heading up the sec investigation into frobisher's company, but according to a former sec investigator...
Laura watkins.
I met with her.
she believed that moore was making a big show of wanting to take down frobisher, but behind the scenes he was torpedoing the investigation.
and all the rest of this
the hotel records, the rental car receipts, a flight manifest...
all show that george moore was in jacksonville, florida the weekend before frobisher sold his stock.
Moore drove down to palm beach to tip off frobisher.
it's a nice theory.
no proof.
use it anyway.
put pressure on moore.
to do what?
get frobisher to settle.
I could never understand why moore leaked arlington, but now it makes perfect sense.
he must be afraid of what would come out in a trial.
Moore wants the whole case to go away, and if he knows that you're closing in on him...
he'll give us more dirt we can use against frobisher.
so...
we need to go back to moore.
I think so.
and you're the only lawyer in my firm he'll talk to.
it's a nice apartment.
isn't it?
go back to moore.
and...
of course you can have your job back.
I don't want it.
but I'll talk to moore.
I want you to win this case.
our court date-- six weeks, folks.
Tom's running point, so if he needs you to do something, do it.
exhibits, witness prep.
it is deadline time.
Felicia, do you have the expert list?
you'll get it tomorrow.
that's it.
make your mothers proud.
where was ellen this morning? - I don't know.
maybe she wasn't feeling well.
Tom, half the office saw her storm out the other day.
did patty fire her?
just focus on the case.
everyone's talking about it.
what are we supposed to tell them? - Whatever you want.
tell them ellen's dead.
just get me the goddamn expert list.
I hope she was fired.
I never liked her.
Hey.
what are you doing here?
I thought you could use some lunch.
what do we got here?
a nice filet, some asparagus, and some blackberry cobbler.
sweetie, this is stupendous.
I finished my meetings this morning, and i just realized how much I missed you.
I know, I know, I'm sorry.
this case has just taken over my life.
they all do, ray, but this one...
this one's different.
I worry about you.
you're so quiet these days.
what?
you never accused me of that before.
well, it's true.
soon as the case is over, I'll be a regular ol' chatterbox again.
well, that'll be nice.
we'll take a few days, go see your sister in tacoma.
I'll believe that when I see it.
I promise.
sit, sit, eat.
Oh, that smells good.
200251
more wine?
why not?
we're going to be closing soon, so...
looks like I'm your last customer.
I suppose I just lost track of the time.
you're always coming in here with work. What do you do?
I'm an attorney.
you know, I don't believe I've ever caught your name.
ray.
a blackout?
you were probably still in kindergarten.
this was 1977, the very first week I arrived.
an auspicious debut. Shit.
guess when I got here.
when?
last september.
you don't say. Yeah.
before or after?
just before.
it almost made my change my mind, but then I thought...
if I leave now...
they win. Right.
I probably should have left, though.
Why's that?
I don't know, I...
I just can'T...
get going, you know?
I live in a shithole, and i barely make enough to pay my rent.
why did you decide to move here in the first place?
I'll try anything once, I guess.
Oh, I'm sorry.
that's my wife.
you're married?
never seen her; you never bring her in.
Oh, I come in here to work, clear my head.
you like being an attorney?
I like the relationship between attorney and client.
there's an intimacy there, a trust.
someone puts himself in your hands.
and you like that.
I do.
what the hell are you doing here?
Oh, uh, a couple downstairs said the ceiling was dripping.
just, um...
checking for a leak.
and the lamp?
noticed a bulb was out.
does ellen know that you're here?
no.
Patty hewes told me to extra special care of you.
next time, you call me.
don't ever do this again.
6 DAYS LATER
you have 57 new messages.
Patty, it's tom.
it's tom.
I'm in rome now. I'm worried about you...
it's tom...
Yeah, mom, I'm up at henry'S. Everything's fine...
I don't know how to tell you this.
I just got a call from hollis nye.
somehow, ellen's in jail.
I don't know how to tell you this.
I just got a call from hollis nye.
somehow, ellen's in jail.
she was arrested for killing david.
how was sawgrass?
I'm sorry?
did you hit the green on 17 or end up in the drink?
depends on when you're talking about.
june, 2002.
you were in jacksonville, florida the weekend before frobisher dumped his stock.
Ah, yes.
I hit the green.
I'm sure you did.
then you drove four hours to palm beach and tipped off frobisher that the sec was about to release a report damning his company's finances.
Frobisher give you a nice kickback?
I was trying to prosecute arthur frobisher.
not according to laura watkins.
look, I don't know what you think...
I think you want this case to be over, and i think that we can help each other.
give us something on frobisher.
and if I don't?
then patty hewes starts looking into you.
your finances, your investments, your bank accounts
anything you have hidden, she'll find it.
I told you, I can't give you frobisher.
but I can give you somebody.
who?
same time, tomorrow night, meet me here.
I'll bring you a present.
Jesus...
you scared me.
you're so cute when you think you're alone. Yeah?
Ugh, I'm living life in reverse.
first breakfast then bed.
what's that?
it's our first wedding gift.
don't get too excited, though. It's from aunt marge and uncle fran.
a garden gnome?
we live in an apartment.
thank god your family has some taste.
what did patty have to say?
she offered me my job back.
what did you say?
I said no.
good.
I don't like having her in our lives.
neither do I.
you want breakfast? - Sure
Aw, no.
who is it?
don't answer it.
but this is the third time she's called this week.
well, we need do something.
we need to talk.
how did it go with judge toomey?
Patty, when are you going to announce ellen's firing?

Yeah, it was the first movie I saw in, like, four months where I actually stayed awake.
OK -Yeah
okay, babe. I love you
love
hey there, ray.
Hello, patty.
you want a drink?
Thanks, no.
well, sit.
how you holding up?
I've been better.
did I ever tell you why I became a lawyer, ray?
no, you never told me.
I thought I could change the world.
silly, huh?
I just liked getting to wear a tie every day.
you and I are two sides of the same coin.
how's that?
we love the game.
another case, a bigger win.
it's an addiction like any other.
you're blackmailing me, patty.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
long as we're clear.
Frobisher is guilty, ray.
help me set things right.
you're a friend.
we bring out the best in each other.
after this, we have a hundred more rounds to go.
I don't see how that's possible.
I am not looking to destroy you.
we attorneys survive.
it's the clients that come and go.
I can't go into a courtroom...
and deliberately lose my case.
I know it will be painful, ray.
but six months, a year from now, it'll all blow over, and you'll come work with me.
I'm serious.
you would do that?
hire the finest goddamn litigator I've ever come up against?
Yes, ray.
Absolutely.
there's a place for you here.
it's win-win, for both of us.
okay, patty.
good, ray.
I'm glad.
you know...
I always wanted to work with you, patty.
not anymore.
you have one new message.
Ellen. Ellen, it's me.
look, there's something here that you really got to see.
Katie brought you a videotape that gregory malina made.
gregory confessed everything about what happened in florida.
I'm going to leave it in our hiding place, okay?
you go in, you get the tape, and you get out.
you ready? - Yeah.
give me your penlight.
Where's yours? - I'm not sure.
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am. I'll take a look.
bloody, half-naked, wandering the streets at 7: 00 A. M.
just your type.
you get a name?
all we found on her was this.
Hollis M. Nye, attorney-at-law.
you her lawyer?
no. A friend.
you have a current address?
Yes, certainly.
she, uh, she lives with her fianc?
we have a problem.
the police just came to see me about ellen parsons.
10 DAYS LATER
your mom made these for us.
I'm accused of murder, and my mom bakes cookies.
sounds about right.
who attacked you?
I don't know.
I never saw him before.
your mom said patty hewes posted the bail.
she knows I'm innocent.
she's representing me now.
when is david's funeral?
I can't go.
why not?
conditions of my bail. I...
I can't travel.
Patty can petition the judge for an allowance.
I don't know if david's family even wants me to be there.
I am so sorry, el.
could you help me? I'm looking for lot 77.
Yeah, you want to stay on the path then swing a right at the oak grove.
thank you.
you don't look like you're from around here.
it's been 35 years.
3 DAYS LATER
anything I can do?
I'll be up in a minute.
how does ray fiske's suicide affect our case?
judge toomey granted the opposition a one-month continuance, Which we expected under the circumstances.
and marshall phillips has assumed lead counsel for mr. Frobisher.
he a good attorney?
he's one of the best.
has there been another offer since we turned down the 500 million?
no, not yet.
I want to reiterate that none of what's happened can detract from our case.
we know what frobisher did,
and we're ready to prove it to a jury.
your office is finished.
I promise you, patty, the place is as good as new.
thank you, pete.
DNA tests confirm that the blood of an unknown male was found
in my apartment and on my client's clothing.
that corroborates her story that she was attacked.
by who?
there was no body found in your apartment.
our detectives did a thorough forensic search,
they canvassed the building, they talked to the neighbors.
the blood evidence... - Is inconclusive at best.
no, ms. Parsons still had the motive, the opportunity,
and her fingerprints were in the victim's blood on the murder weapon.
she explained that.
can you explain why her apartment was ransacked?
a file cabinet broken into with contents stolen?
I mean, not exactly consistent with a crime of passion, is it?
look, a young doctor was found murdered on riverside drive...
and people are scared, which is why you want this to go away quickly.
I mean, hell, if, if I lived on the upper west side,
I wouldn't sleep tonight.
in fact, I might not want to reelect my district attorney.
ms. Hewes, ellen parsons worked for you.
I don't think you can be objective about this. - I'm not!
I'm not objective at all, and I'm going to turn my passionate,
irrational anger against your office.
I am going to go on every talk show,
every media outlet I can find to expose - How you ignored key evidence in your incompetent rush to accuse... - Ms. Hewes...
how, for political ends,
you destroyed the life of an exceptional young woman,
while the real murderer walks the streets.
this would be a lot more pleasant if I were dealing with you, hollis.
I tried to reason with my client,
but she insisted on ms. Hewes representing her.
what do you want?
the da's agreed to reopen the crime scene.
good. - Ellen...
you still know where the tape is?
of course.
and it's safe?
it's safe.
get the charges dropped, and it's yours.
Ellen pushed me aside.
shit.
who's representing her now?
she got the da to reopen the murder investigation.
all right, how would you like us to play it?
has the videotape been put into evidence?
I don't think so. No.
then maybe patty hewes doesn't have it.
what are we doing, playing guessing games?
there's a goddamn gun out there pointed right at me,
and you don't know if it's loaded.
Jesus!
what about david connor?
do I have to worry about him?
no.
there's nothing that could get back to you.
good. Christ, what a mess.
you're looking for anything incongruous,
anything that didn't belong to you and your fianc?
anything that's not in the right place.
take your time, ms. Parsons.
excuse me.
Hey, rick. - How's it going?
Hey, rosie. - How you doing, rick?
this is detective rick messer.
he asked if he could take a look around,
see if the scene fits the profile of a case he's working downtown.
any luck?
no.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
I hope they find the guy.
can we have a moment, please?
1972524
Hi.
I'm... Sorry, patricia.
I'm terribly sorry.
Mr. Frobisher?
you wanted to see me? - Yeah. Yeah, I do. What...
she turned down $500 million, larry.
what the hell's going on over there?
does she have something?
I don't know. She's not telling us anything.
then what do I have you for?
Larry, you know, you haven't given me anything in weeks.
what can I do?
all right, look.
has she said anything about a videotape?
think-- a videotape? A confession?
what? No.
I don't know nothing about that. What tape?
what are you talking about?
no... Forget it.
I got to tell you, mr. Frobisher, ever since your deposition, - I don't think she's going to settle for any amount. - Goddamn it!
you know something-- I don't pay you to think. Do I, larry?
you haven't paid me for anything, mr. Frobisher... - I need facts, all right?
I need information, that's all I want. - Mr. Frobisher, i know!
no, you actually don't know!
you don't know shit, and you've done shit...
which is exactly what you're going to get from me.
I ain't paying you a penny.
I don't need your money, you prick!
I have to admit, I think there's something you're not telling me.
Arthur, why hasn't this case already settled?
what's this?
ray with gregory malina.
Jesus.
was ray having a thing with this kid? - I don't know.
maybe.
I mean, the kid's a hustler, for christ sake. He's a liar.
ray brought him down to florida the same weekend I was there.
the kid took advantage of him. He tried to extort money from him.
how?
he made up some bullshit videotape, confessing crap that never happened.
what did happen in florida, arthur?
palm Beach 2002
I stepped into that condo and she was staring right at me.
that girl was high and out of her mind.
my assistant assured me, she didn't see a thing.
and you believed him?
Hey, relax.
we'll take care of the girl.
you have my word on that.
now tell me.
it's not good.
this is the report we're going to be filing next week.
the sec has evidence that
the accounting fraud in your company has been going on for years.
what kind of evidence?
you use shell corporations to hide your debt.
you book potential earnings as current earnings to artificially boost profits.
I can't even tell what I'm looking at here.
I've known you 40 years.
don't give me that shit, arthur.
what happened in florida?
nothing.
absolutely nothing.
so this tape...
have you viewed it?
no. - Did ray?
I don't know. But...
Malina wrote him a letter saying the tape was out there.
and you think patty has it?
she might.
well...
there's a way to find out.
we file for summary judgment.
we get the judge to rule on the case now.
it'll force patty to show her hand.
but what if she does have the tape?
well, then at least we'll know where we stand.
but if she doesn't, based on the evidence i've seen,
I'm betting the judge will dismiss the whole case.
summary judgment.
why wait for a trial when a judge can decide the case now?
if I file today, this all could be over by next month.
we're going to trial.
I'll be in touch.
turn this over to a judge? What is he, crazy?
he's desperate.
he needs to know if we have the tape.
so phillips is forcing your hand?
I need the tape, ellen.
if the judge rules against us, we lose the case.
that would be unfortunate.
I'm doing everything I can to exonerate you.
I had the crime scene reopened...
there was nothing there.
I've hired my own investigators.
I'm putting as much pressure on the da as I can.
I don't think so.
he's a da.
das want to be reelected.
Yes, they do.
so cut a deal with him.
give him what he wants.
right over there, it's going to be the r&d building.
you know what that is?
Yeah. It's research and development. - There you go.
that's the brain center of any company.
hub of creation, that's where...
that's where dreams are forged into reality.
are we losing the house, dad?
Holly said she and bethie are moving out to aspen.
well, whatever happens,
you're going to be living with your mom in san diego.
well, why can't I stay here with you?
I've got a lot on my plate right now.
so what, I just have to pick up and just move across the country?
Hey, you know something?
you need to grow up.
I'm dealing with some... Hey, listen to me.
I'm dealing with some major shit here.
I'm a guy who always lands on his feet.
but right now, I need to focus on making things right.
you understand that?
No...Yeah. Whatever.
Hey, come here. Come here, come here.
I did something stupid, owen.
I made A... Big mistake.
I'm going to be paying for the rest of my life.
what mistake?
I trusted too many people.
all right.
what's it going to take?
what's what going to take?
for you to drop these preposterous charges against ellen parsons.
you didn't find any new evidence.
let's cut the bullshit and talk business.
you're a free woman.
you struck a deal?
the da dropped the charges.
the investigation's been reopened.
they'll be a press conference later today.
you can go to david's funeral now.
thank you.
you're welcome.
now where's the tape?
you told me you did.
I told you it was safe.
you got five minutes. - Thank you.
good evening.
got have a few minutes?
in 2002...
I met ray fiske.
I didn't know this at the time, but he was arthur frobisher's lawyer.
shortly after, mr. Fiske sent me down to florida to help set up a meeting.
I didn't know what this meeting was about,
but I know that arthur frobisher was in contact with
a member of the securities and exchange commission.
the name of that member is...
tipped you off.
that's going to get you quite a few years in the federal penitentiary.
tell me what you want.
well, we have a couple of options.
what are they?
if I turn this over to the U. S.Attorney's office,
you either plead guilty or you fight it in court.
either way, you lose years of your life,
and I'm still waiting in the wings to bleed you dry in a civil trial.
and the other option?
we settle.
at my price.
the videotape?
it goes away forever.
you'll sign a nondisclosure agreement?
all the evidence i have against you will never come to light.
so think about it.
but not for too long.
if I don't hear from you by the end of the day tomorrow,
I'm going to treat some friends of mine at the justice department to dinner and a movie.
boy, you really enjoy this, don't you?
it's my job.
why do you hate me so much?
someone was attacked in our home. You haven't said a word about it.
I didn't get attacked.
Ellen saw you, michael.
you said you were going to henry's house for the weekend.
I did.
then what were you doing here?
I left my laptop, so I came back to pick it up.
why, am I a suspect?
no.
then why are you interrogating me?
we'd just like to know why you feel the need to lie.
maybe it just runs in the family.
I've gone over all of it with your money managers.
now, remember, this is just a theoretical dismantling of your asset structure.
what did they come up with?
you'd have to give up 93% of your net worth.
they'd start with your Bonds preferred stock, and then move on to real estate.
the houses?
Yes, all the houses.
fine.
liquidate all of it.
foreign holdings, domestic holdings.
I don't really care about anything else,
but I need to know that I can keep the new land that I'm developing.
Arthur, you don't have to do this.
we could still win.
can I keep the goddamn land, marshall?
Yes.
promise me that.
we would find a way for you to keep your land.
all right.
pay her.
Arthur, this is ludicrous.
let's just cool down and think this through.
I have thought it through, marshall, and it's my call.
pay her.
what about our motion for summary judgment?
a settlement like you're talking about, we have nothing to lose.
I have everything to lose, marshall.
that number is astronomical.
even if we lose at trial, you may never have to pay a figure so high.
I'll give a jury a dozen reasons to award your employees less than that.
I will build all this back up again, believe me.
but right now, I'm done with this.
I need to move on.
miss hewes, marshall phillips is here to see you.
thank you, betty. Send him in.
Marshall. This is a surprise.
Oh, I doubt that.
please.
can you believe it's almost fall?
what sign are you?
we're dropping our motion for summary judgment.
my client has instructed me to extend to you this settlement offer.
there's a condition.
he wants a nondisclosure agreement.
all evidence sealed.
nothing comes out.
whatever you've got is buried.
otherwise, the offer evaporates.
understood.
tell him we accept.
you knew my father, didn't you?
I never liked him.
Oh, he never liked you.
he always thought your cases had a stink to them.
good to see you, marshall.
together, we hit a few bumps along the way,
but in the end you believed in me and in our justice system.
your trust won this case.
Cheers!
there's a psychiatrist there.
why'd you come in this room? - Larry?
do you have a moment? - The light was on.
don't sit, larry. This won't take long.
what's going on?
we know you were leaking information to frobisher.
we want you to disclaim your interest in the settlement, voluntarily.
and cut myself out of two billion?
you gotta be kidding me.
if you don't remove yourself,
we'll turn you over to the U. S.Attorney's office.
it's your choice.
but I made amends.
they've made their decision, larry.
Hey, I'm 70 years old.
I lost everything.
the man came to me. What was I supposed to do, huh?
what am I gonna do now?
before you go?
if you'll excuse me? - Sure.
your first victory as an attorney.
have you given any thought to what you're going to do next?
I don't much care at the moment.
your office is still empty.
I'm sure someone will make good use of it.
the job is yours, ellen.
anytime you're ready.
thanks for the drink.
Mr. Nye.
get in the car.
they know what you did, ellen.
who are you?
I'm agent harrison. This is agent .
we're with the fbi.
miss parsons, the night of ray fiske's suicide,
you were seen leaving hewes & associates.
I worked there.
you were fired at the time.
what is this about?
it's about patricia hewes.
and the frobisher case?
no, we were investigating ms. Hewes long before the frobisher case.
Arthur frobisher had my fianc? Killed, and you're investigating patty hewes?
I tried to warn you, ellen.
you talk to us, maybe we overlook what you were doing there that night.
this is your leverage?
you're gonna have to do better than that, this picture means nothing.
you don't want us pursuing it.
go ahead.
thanks for the chat.
we commend our brother, david connor,
unto you, lord, now that he has passed from this life.
may he live on in your presence.
eternal rest grant unto him, o lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon him.
may he rest in peace.
may his soul, and the souls of the faithful departed,
through the mercy of god, rest in peace. Amen.
Amen.
I'm trying to forgive you.
you don't have to.
it's my fault.
no.
this whole thing started because I took frobisher's money.
the last time...
the last time I saw david...
we had a fight.
and he was right.
he was right about everything.
thank you for...
thank you for letting me come today.
david would have wanted you here.
I know you're not the enemy in all of this.
thank you.
call me when you get back to new york.
okay, let me know.
we're square.
indeed, we are.
you didn't get this from me.
you sound like my college girlfriend.
sit on it till the next election.
when it comes out, there'll be a lot more lawsuits.
shareholders are going to go after the rest of frobisher's fortune.
and you can send him to jail.
Hey!
now
I've been in touch with the da's office every day.
and what have they found?
well, they've turned the crime scene inside out, but...
even if they find the guys who did this...
they'll never trace them back to frobisher?
I'm sorry.
so, patty tells me that you're not coming back to work.
so you're in the loop again.
now that you're partner, you must have got a nice chunk of change from that settlement.
Yeah. Yeah.
so...
what did, what did you and patty do to win this thing?
enjoy your money, tom.
there's a lot of great charities out there.
Hey, can I ask you something?
sure.
when patty went away, did she ever tell you where she went?
no.
told me she was visiting family.
2 WEEKS EARLIER
you, uh, had a little girl.
she died before delivery.
may I ask...
is there a name you'd like on the certificate?
you wanted to speak with me?
the other night at my apartment...
you asked me if I regret what we did.
I want you to know...
that I do.
I deeply regret it.
why are you telling me this now?
because you're right.
I've lied.
I hired you to get to katie. I've...
manipulated you.
I am ashamed of what I did.
I hope you can forgive me.
someday.
I have...
a lot of flaws.
come back, ellen.
give me a second chance.
I was thinking of going away for a while.
without david, I...
I don't have a reason to be anywhere.
I understand.
I don't believe in the law anymore.
but I believe in justice.
so i'll come work for you again.
on one condition.
what's that?
let me use the firm's resources to prove that frobisher had david killed.
it's a deal.
thank you.
you're welcome.
thanks for the chat.
what are you looking at her for?
fraud, conspiracy, obstruction of justice.
now, mr. Nye tells us you might have reasons of your own for wanting to take down ms. Hewes.
Yes.
I do.
do you regret what we did?
because I do.
you do?
while I'm gone, you're welcome to stay here.
it's done.
she tried to kill me.
how do you know that?
because I know patty.
see you on monday.
you want me to go back and work for her?
ms. Parsons, you'll be working for us.
see you monday.
you have one new message.
Ellen. Ellen, it's me.
look, there's something here that you really got to see.
Katie brought you a videotape that gregory malina made.
gregory confessed everything about what happened in florida.
I'm going to leave it in our hiding place, okay?
you go in, you get the tape, and you get out.
you ready? - Yeah.
give me your penlight.
Where's yours? - I'm not sure.
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am. I'll take a look.
bloody, half-naked, wandering the streets at 7: 00 A. M.
just your type.
you get a name?
all we found on her was this.
Hollis M. Nye, attorney-at-law.
you her lawyer?
no. A friend.
you have a current address?
Yes, certainly.
she, uh, she lives with her fianc?
we have a problem.
the police just came to see me about ellen parsons.
10 DAYS LATER
your mom made these for us.
I'm accused of murder, and my mom bakes cookies.
sounds about right.
who attacked you?
I don't know.
I never saw him before.
your mom said patty hewes posted the bail.
she knows I'm innocent.
she's representing me now.
when is david's funeral?
I can't go.
why not?
conditions of my bail. I...
I can't travel.
Patty can petition the judge for an allowance.
I don't know if david's family even wants me to be there.
I am so sorry, el.
could you help me? I'm looking for lot 77.
Yeah, you want to stay on the path then swing a right at the oak grove.

Hi.
I'm... Sorry, patricia.
I'm terribly sorry.
Mr. Frobisher?
you wanted to see me? - Yeah. Yeah, I do. What...
she turned down $500 million, larry.
what the hell's going on over there?
does she have something?
I don't know. She's not telling us anything.
then what do I have you for?
Larry, you know, you haven't given me anything in weeks.

you haven't paid me for anything, mr. Frobisher... - I need facts, all right?
I need information, that's all I want. - Mr. Frobisher, i know!
no, you actually don't know!
you don't know shit, and you've done shit...
which is exactly what you're going to get from me.
I ain't paying you a penny.
I don't need your money, you prick!
I have to admit, I think there's something you're not telling me.
Arthur, why hasn't this case already settled?
what's this?
ray with gregory malina.
Jesus.
was ray having a thing with this kid? - I don't know.
maybe.
I mean, the kid's a hustler, for christ sake. He's a liar.
ray brought him down to florida the same weekend I was there.
the kid took advantage of him. He tried to extort money from him.
how?
he made up some bullshit videotape, confessing crap that never happened.
what did happen in florida, arthur?
palm Beach 2002
I stepped into that condo and she was staring right at me.
that girl was high and out of her mind.
my assistant assured me, she didn't see a thing.
and you believed him?
Hey, relax.
we'll take care of the girl.
you have my word on that.
now tell me.
it's not good.
this is the report we're going to be filing next week.
the sec has evidence that
the accounting fraud in your company has been going on for years.
what kind of evidence?
you use shell corporations to hide your debt.
you book potential earnings as current earnings to artificially boost profits.
I can't even tell what I'm looking at here.
I've known you 40 years.
don't give me that shit, arthur.
what happened in florida?
nothing.
absolutely nothing.
so this tape...
have you viewed it?
no. - Did ray?
I don't know. But...
Malina wrote him a letter saying the tape was out there.
and you think patty has it?
she might.
well...
there's a way to find out.
we file for summary judgment.
we get the judge to rule on the case now.
it'll force patty to show her hand.
but what if she does have the tape?
well, then at least we'll know where we stand.
but if she doesn't, based on the evidence i've seen,
I'm betting the judge will dismiss the whole case.
summary judgment.
why wait for a trial when a judge can decide the case now?
if I file today, this all could be over by next month.
we're going to trial.
I'll be in touch.
turn this over to a judge? What is he, crazy?
he's desperate.
he needs to know if we have the tape.
so phillips is forcing your hand?
I need the tape, ellen.
if the judge rules against us, we lose the case.
that would be unfortunate.
I'm doing everything I can to exonerate you.
I had the crime scene reopened...
there was nothing there.
I've hired my own investigators.
I'm putting as much pressure on the da as I can.
I don't think so.
he's a da.
das want to be reelected.
Yes, they do.
so cut a deal with him.
give him what he wants.
right over there, it's going to be the r&d building.
you know what that is?
Yeah. It's research and development. - There you go.
that's the brain center of any company.
hub of creation, that's where...
that's where dreams are forged into reality.
are we losing the house, dad?
Holly said she and bethie are moving out to aspen.
well, whatever happens,
you're going to be living with your mom in san diego.
well, why can't I stay here with you?
I've got a lot on my plate right now.
so what, I just have to pick up and just move across the country?
Hey, you know something?
you need to grow up.
I'm dealing with some... Hey, listen to me.
I'm dealing with some major shit here.
I'm a guy who always lands on his feet.
but right now, I need to focus on making things right.
you understand that?
No...Yeah. Whatever.
Hey, come here. Come here, come here.
I did something stupid, owen.
I made A... Big mistake.
I'm going to be paying for the rest of my life.
what mistake?
I trusted too many people.
all right.
what's it going to take?
what's what going to take?
for you to drop these preposterous charges against ellen parsons.
you didn't find any new evidence.
let's cut the bullshit and talk business.
you're a free woman.
you struck a deal?
the da dropped the charges.
the investigation's been reopened.
they'll be a press conference later today.
you can go to david's funeral now.
thank you.
you're welcome.
now where's the tape?
you told me you did.
I told you it was safe.
you got five minutes. - Thank you.
good evening.
got have a few minutes?
in 2002...
I met ray fiske.
I didn't know this at the time, but he was arthur frobisher's lawyer.
shortly after, mr. Fiske sent me down to florida to help set up a meeting.
I didn't know what this meeting was about,
but I know that arthur frobisher was in contact with
a member of the securities and exchange commission.
the name of that member is...
tipped you off.
that's going to get you quite a few years in the federal penitentiary.
tell me what you want.
well, we have a couple of options.
what are they?
if I turn this over to the U. S.Attorney's office,
you either plead guilty or you fight it in court.
either way, you lose years of your life,
and I'm still waiting in the wings to bleed you dry in a civil trial.
and the other option?
we settle.
at my price.
the videotape?
it goes away forever.
you'll sign a nondisclosure agreement?
all the evidence i have against you will never come to light.
so think about it.
but not for too long.
if I don't hear from you by the end of the day tomorrow,
I'm going to treat some friends of mine at the justice department to dinner and a movie.
boy, you really enjoy this, don't you?
it's my job.
why do you hate me so much?
someone was attacked in our home. You haven't said a word about it.
I didn't get attacked.
Ellen saw you, michael.
you said you were going to henry's house for the weekend.
I did.
then what were you doing here?
I left my laptop, so I came back to pick it up.
why, am I a suspect?
no.
then why are you interrogating me?
we'd just like to know why you feel the need to lie.
maybe it just runs in the family.
I've gone over all of it with your money managers.
now, remember, this is just a theoretical dismantling of your asset structure.
what did they come up with?
you'd have to give up 93% of your net worth.
they'd start with your Bonds preferred stock, and then move on to real estate.
the houses?
Yes, all the houses.
fine.
liquidate all of it.
foreign holdings, domestic holdings.
I don't really care about anything else,
but I need to know that I can keep the new land that I'm developing.
Arthur, you don't have to do this.
we could still win.
can I keep the goddamn land, marshall?
Yes.
promise me that.
we would find a way for you to keep your land.
all right.
pay her.
Arthur, this is ludicrous.
let's just cool down and think this through.
I have thought it through, marshall, and it's my call.
pay her.
what about our motion for summary judgment?
a settlement like you're talking about, we have nothing to lose.
I have everything to lose, marshall.
that number is astronomical.
even if we lose at trial, you may never have to pay a figure so high.
I'll give a jury a dozen reasons to award your employees less than that.
I will build all this back up again, believe me.
but right now, I'm done with this.
I need to move on.
miss hewes, marshall phillips is here to see you.
thank you, betty. Send him in.
Marshall. This is a surprise.
Oh, I doubt that.
please.
can you believe it's almost fall?
what sign are you?
we're dropping our motion for summary judgment.
my client has instructed me to extend to you this settlement offer.
there's a condition.
he wants a nondisclosure agreement.
all evidence sealed.
nothing comes out.
whatever you've got is buried.
otherwise, the offer evaporates.
understood.
tell him we accept.
you knew my father, didn't you?
I never liked him.
Oh, he never liked you.
he always thought your cases had a stink to them.
good to see you, marshall.
together, we hit a few bumps along the way,
but in the end you believed in me and in our justice system.
your trust won this case.
Cheers!
there's a psychiatrist there.
why'd you come in this room? - Larry?
do you have a moment? - The light was on.
don't sit, larry. This won't take long.
what's going on?
we know you were leaking information to frobisher.
we want you to disclaim your interest in the settlement, voluntarily.
and cut myself out of two billion?
you gotta be kidding me.
if you don't remove yourself,
we'll turn you over to the U. S.Attorney's office.
it's your choice.
but I made amends.
they've made their decision, larry.
Hey, I'm 70 years old.
I lost everything.
the man came to me. What was I supposed to do, huh?
what am I gonna do now?
before you go?
if you'll excuse me? - Sure.
your first victory as an attorney.
have you given any thought to what you're going to do next?
I don't much care at the moment.
your office is still empty.
I'm sure someone will make good use of it.
the job is yours, ellen.
anytime you're ready.
thanks for the drink.
Mr. Nye.
get in the car.
they know what you did, ellen.
who are you?
I'm agent harrison. This is agent .
we're with the fbi.
miss parsons, the night of ray fiske's suicide,
you were seen leaving hewes & associates.
I worked there.
you were fired at the time.
what is this about?
it's about patricia hewes.
and the frobisher case?
no, we were investigating ms. Hewes long before the frobisher case.
Arthur frobisher had my fianc? Killed, and you're investigating patty hewes?
I tried to warn you, ellen.
you talk to us, maybe we overlook what you were doing there that night.
this is your leverage?
you're gonna have to do better than that, this picture means nothing.
you don't want us pursuing it.
go ahead.
thanks for the chat.
we commend our brother, david connor,
unto you, lord, now that he has passed from this life.
may he live on in your presence.
eternal rest grant unto him, o lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon him.
may he rest in peace.
may his soul, and the souls of the faithful departed,
through the mercy of god, rest in peace. Amen.
Amen.
I'm trying to forgive you.
you don't have to.
it's my fault.
no.
this whole thing started because I took frobisher's money.
the last time...
the last time I saw david...
we had a fight.
and he was right.
he was right about everything.
thank you for...
thank you for letting me come today.
david would have wanted you here.
I know you're not the enemy in all of this.
thank you.
call me when you get back to new york.
okay, let me know.
we're square.
indeed, we are.
you didn't get this from me.
you sound like my college girlfriend.
sit on it till the next election.
when it comes out, there'll be a lot more lawsuits.
shareholders are going to go after the rest of frobisher's fortune.
and you can send him to jail.
Hey!
now
I've been in touch with the da's office every day.
and what have they found?
well, they've turned the crime scene inside out, but...
even if they find the guys who did this...
they'll never trace them back to frobisher?
I'm sorry.
so, patty tells me that you're not coming back to work.
so you're in the loop again.
now that you're partner, you must have got a nice chunk of change from that settlement.
Yeah. Yeah.
so...
what did, what did you and patty do to win this thing?
enjoy your money, tom.
there's a lot of great charities out there.
Hey, can I ask you something?
sure.
when patty went away, did she ever tell you where she went?
no.
told me she was visiting family.
2 WEEKS EARLIER
you, uh, had a little girl.
she died before delivery.
may I ask...
is there a name you'd like on the certificate?
you wanted to speak with me?
the other night at my apartment...
you asked me if I regret what we did.
I want you to know...
that I do.
I deeply regret it.
why are you telling me this now?
because you're right.
I've lied.
I hired you to get to katie. I've...
manipulated you.
I am ashamed of what I did.
I hope you can forgive me.
someday.
I have...
a lot of flaws.
come back, ellen.
give me a second chance.
I was thinking of going away for a while.
without david, I...
I don't have a reason to be anywhere.
I understand.
I don't believe in the law anymore.
but I believe in justice.
so i'll come work for you again.
on one condition.
what's that?
let me use the firm's resources to prove that frobisher had david killed.
it's a deal.
thank you.
you're welcome.
thanks for the chat.
what are you looking at her for?
fraud, conspiracy, obstruction of justice.
now, mr. Nye tells us you might have reasons of your own for wanting to take down ms. Hewes.
Yes.
I do.
do you regret what we did?
because I do.
you do?
while I'm gone, you're welcome to stay here.
it's done.
she tried to kill me.
how do you know that?
because I know patty.
see you on monday.
you want me to go back and work for her?
ms. Parsons, you'll be working for us.
see you monday.
uh, I'm ellen parsons.
I'm here to interview.
you're hired.
a young lawyer with a fantastic new job and a dreamy doctor fianc?
Arthur frobisher told his employees to invest in the company, and then sold his own stock.
it's classic pump-and-dump.
let her depose me.
we're going to trial, ray.
there are 5, 000 people who lost everything.
they deserve justice.
I mopped your floors 34 years.
I cleaned your shit!
you watch what you say.
I'm done here.
you're blackmailing me, patty.
no one can ever know what he was doing here.
you're a lawyer. Lies come with the territory.
make up your mind, ellen.
do you want to play mind games like these people, or do you want to be yourself?
we crossed a line.
do you regret what we did? Because I do.
you do?
while I'm gone, you're welcome to stay here.
it's done.
I'm agent harrison. This is agent werner. We're with the fbi.
what is this about?
it's about patricia hewes.
Mr. Nye tells us you might have reasons of your own for wanting to take down ms. Hewes.
she tried to kill me.
come back, ellen.
I'll come work for you again on one condition.
let me use the firm's resources to prove that frobisher had david killed.
it's a deal.
you want me to go back and work for her?
miss parsons you will be working for us.
see you on monday.
what's the matter?
you shouldn't be scared.
actually...
I take that back.
you should be scared.
you should be terrified.
it would just be so much easier if you said the words.
I can never remember the name of this song.
all I want you to do is tell the truth.
but I know that can be hard for you...
so...
I brought something that i thought might help.
and who knows?
maybe the truth will set you free.
6 MONTHS EARLIER
and now, here's one of our good friends, just off a big courtroom win.
please welcome back patty hewes. - Yes!
Yes, look who's here!
Patty, it's so good to see you. - You're gorgeous.
Congratulations. - Thank you.
you look good, patty. - Thank you.
Oh, boy. So, be honest now.
how much did you rake in on this latest case of yours? - Oh, regis!
what? Really, what was it, two-billion dollar settlement?
people want to know how rich she is-- you know that.
well, I'll tell you if you tell me.
gelman, gelman, what do I make?
what do I make, the union scale?
of course, that's all. That's all I got.
Oh, please. So, tell us about this arthur frobisher.
pretty wealthy guy, right?
not anymore.
our plaintiffs were very well taken care of.
so, what are you gonna do with all that money?
well, actually, I'm gonna use a good portion of the money to fund a foundation to fight hunger in new york city.
it's very important to give back to the community.
Yeah, I think so, and I'm also partnering in the charity with my good friend, sam arsenault.
saving the world's great, but you've got to be chomping at the bit to take your next case, huh?
not at the moment.
it's my son's last year in high school, and this charity is keeping my hands pretty full.
wow, that's amazing. I mean, you know, a high-profile attorney, of course, but committed mother working full-time.
I don't know how you manage to balance it all.
well, I mean, you... you do the same thing.
it is difficult, but I have a fantastic team at the firm.
you know, I believe i chatted with one of your associates backstage in the green room.
Ellen parsons, yeah. She's fantastic.
isn't she standing in the wings? You want to say hello, ellen?
Ellen! - There she is.
Ellen's been with, uh...
she's been with the firm not even a year.
and I can tell you, I would be absolutely lost without her, so she deserves a lot of credit.
the woman's full of shit.
a month ago, she tried to kill me, and now she's acting like my best friend.
the bureau's putting together a case we'll want patty to take.
we're gonna need you to pitch it to her.
okay. What is it?
a setup.
we'll use you to monitor it from the inside.
great. When do we start?
soon, ellen. We're just working out a few details.
how soon?
you got to relax, okay? Lay low.
that's easy for you to say.
you just want to arrest patty hewes.
and you don't? - I want to destroy her.
Oh, no. No. Please.
revenge fantasies are normal when we're dealing with posttraumatic stress.
see, the right side of the brain tries to process our trauma to help us understand what we've been through.
Ellen, how about you?
have you had any more revenge fantasies about the man that you think killed your fianc?
No!
nothing comes to mind.
Ellen is in counseling three or four times a week.
she's moving to the sullivan grand hotel.
you don't need to watch her anymore, pete.
are you sure you can trust her?
maybe it's best if I keep an eye on her.
no. That's all in the past.
okay.
fine. Watch her.
I'm concerned about her well-being.
so, you gonna make me say it?
how about today? You ready to jump back in?
the firm is trying plenty of cases.
but you aren't.
I hear what you're saying.
good. All right, I'll bring you the top three cases, and you just pick the one you like.
excuse me.
we're hearing rumors their findings could come out as soon as next month.
the kentucky operations have been calling in nonstop.
they're getting nervous about new york.
tell them to relax. We're prepared.
assure them that there's nothing to worry about.
Mr. Purcell? Mr. Purcell.
this isn't my work.
Mr. Purcell, calm down.
this is... horseshit.
I'm not gonna sign off on this.
we're in a meeting here.
a very important meeting?
this ends today. You hear me?
where are we with the irs?
they expedited our charitable tax-exempt status based on sam arsenault's verbal commitment, so as soon as he makes it official, we're off to the races.
with any luck, we can start doing some good.
that's the general idea.
what, ellen? - Nothing.
I think the foundation's great.
it will leave an imprint for generations.
no.
you think I'm just creating this to clear my conscience.
why would you need to clear your conscience?
because of what we did to win the frobisher case.
you mean, ray fiske's suicide?
my conscience is clear about that.
so how are you doing?
counseling... - No, I'd... rather not talk about it.
well, I just want you to know you can have time off if you ever need it.
work's the best thing for me right now.
where are you on frobisher?
is there anything new on david's murder?
has my investigator been helpful?
he found out frobisher was in critical condition after the shooting.
a construction crew found him and had him airlifted to st. Anthony's.
he had abdominal surgery there.
last week, he was transferred. - Where?
your guy doesn't know. There's been a total press blackout.
Frobisher doesn't want anyone to find him.
Mr. Frobisher? How you feeling?
like shit.
Yeah, well, four surgeries in a month will do that to you.
how am I doing?
the doc says the kidney should take.
I'm parched.
thank you for taking care of me like this.
just doing my job.
you don't know who I am, do you?
of course I do. Why do you ask?
cause I'm the most hated man in america.
and you're being nice to me.
I want you on the board of directors.
of course you can say no.
but these things have a way of coming to bite you on the ass.
we have a big problem.
think about it, senator. You've got 24 hours.
what is it?
Sam arsenault's people just called. He's backing out.
they didn't want to tell me over the phone, but I forced their hand.
he's withdrawing his entire contribution from the foundation.
Hey, what can i get you? Coffee? Latte?
too early for bourbon? - Never.
Ah, girls today could learn something from you, patty.
you know how to wear a skirt, but you're one of the boys, always have been.
Ah, except for the vagina.
I was just about to have one myself.
explain it to me, sam.
the republican party is going to back me for governor.
but you're an independent.
not anymore.
so I got party politics to worry about.
the elephants don't like you, patty.
I can't be pissing these people off right now.
I need your pledge, sam.
why are you doing this?
let me tell you a story.
back in '83, I was negotiating the syntec merger.
neither side would budge.
the clock was running down.
okay.
so I toss all the lawyers out of my office.
I tell herb weiss to stop over, hash it out mano a mano.
the whole time herb was in there with me,
I've got this sizzling slice of ass from the temp services under the desk taking dictation, if you get my drift.
Yeah, it just wafted my way.
Hey, relax. I married her.
no. No, it was the one before that.
anyway, in the '80s, we all did shit like that.
the point is, why did I do it?
because I'm an asshole? Because I want to feel powerful?
all of the above?
Nah, I don't give a shit about power.
I'm just an old, free love hippie who made a good bet on soybean options.
I did it because...
I wanted to see if I'd get away with it.
Sam, you're making a big mistake.
your daughter's here, mr. Arsenault.
great! Send her in.
sorry, patty. We're grabbing lunch.
there's plenty of time for charity.
we can save the world another day.
ms. Hewes. I'm sorry to interrupt.
Oh, it's nice to see you, lily.
I just ran into michael at this, uh, college admissions thing.
Lily's earned herself a spot at yale.
well, that's quite an accomplishment.
Yeah, I can't wait.
you want to join us for a quick bite?
Oh, I'd love to. No, thanks.
Hey, I'm sorry, patty.
but, uh, I always wanted to run off and join the circus.
well, be careful out there, sam.
there are a lot of clowns under the big top.
good luck at yale.
this was hand-delivered.
no return address. Security x-rayed it. It's clean.
you open it.
what is it?
charts, graphs... I have no idea.
let me see.
ms. Hewes, I have a Daniel Purcell on the phone for you.
when's the last time you talked to him?
ten years at least.
all right, put him through.
did the package arrive?
Yes. What is it?
just keep it.
why did you send this to me?
you're the only one I can trust.
please.
keep it safe.
Daniel, I...
so you want me to get patty to take this case?
Yeah. It's all in here.
researched and vetted, everything you need to present a legitimate infant mortality case.
sounds right up patty's alley.
built in social cause, persuasive lead plaintiff billions in damages at the end of the rainbow.
it's great bait, but how are you going to use this to arrest patty?
one step at a time, ellen.
first you get her to bite, then we'll fill you in on the rest.
any questions?
bad car tires made in China, deep pockets is a major distributor out of jersey.
and it's wide: Over 14 million units and 260 traffic deaths so far.
could be bigger than bridgestone.
in this climate? Public hears China, they scream bloody murder.
we think the complaint can survive a twombly motion. All we have to...
I-I-I... I'm sorry, patty. What's going on?
are we wasting our time?
no. No, no, go on. I'm listening.
okay.
we'll aim, aim a little higher.
Ellen brought this in, and i think she found a grand slam:
infant mortality.
the first time in decades it's going up.
Why? - Hmos.
caesarean births cost them a fortune.
insurance companies don't want to pay, so at-risk, low-income women are being forced into natural birth, and their babies are dying.
there are billions of dollars worth of damages here.
interesting.
