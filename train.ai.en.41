diderot was also a philosophical materialist.
diderot was imprisoned for his writings, an experience, mr blom argues, that left him too scared to lay out his philosophy plainly, instead disguising it within numerous plays, novels and letters.
diderot, born to a cutler in langres, france, was educated by the jesuits in paris.

didier drogba and frank lampard shed tears as they said goodbye to their former manager, with michael essien and florent malouda also upset, but grant's bold tactics appear to have quashed any dissent.
didier drogba and peter cech both had fine individual tournaments, but sadly the ivory coast and czech republic have made early exits.
didier drogba has explained how a summer summit meeting with jose mourinho transformed him from an expensive workhorse into the premiership's most deadly striker.
didier drogba is baffled he is not partnered with nicolas anelka in chelsea attack.
didier drogba is out with a knee ligament strain and robben and duff cannot train still.
didier drogba took part on tuesday afternoon in his first chelsea training session since returning from his appearance in the african cup of nations final.
didier drogba was the scourge of arsenal yet again as he earned chelsea a 1-0 win against arsenal with a second-half winner at stamford bridge.
didier drogba, frank lampard, john terry, nicolas anelka, who gradually age of big, to the need for them when looking for a successor, michael essien, bosingwa state again in decline, while the delay can not be integrated into the ball torres team.
didier drogba, meanwhile, is convinced that, despite the seven-point gap between them and manchester united at the top, chelsea will end the season victorious again.
didier lombard, chief executive, was hauled into the labour ministry to explain himself after news of stephanie's death broke.
didier migaud, the chief auditor and a former socialist deputy, stated bluntly that france was entering a "danger zone," and that a "debt spiral" could not be ruled out.
didier reynders, the belgian finance minister, argued on monday that "it would be preferable if we continued to hold these posts in the future."
didier said he set up the score.
didier was to pick up the rest - 40 large. Some guy.
didier, a friend.
