the most distinguished features of the buildings in the ancient city are "river aligned" and"mountain oriented" .The houses are mostly set by a river,usually parallel to the watercourse and long with roofs of tiles,the front facing the street as shops and the rear hanging over water like towers.
the most distinguishing feature of Mount Wudang is the large Taoist architectural complex. Making full use of the terrain featuring towering mountains and deep valleys,more than 20 000 rooms were built in spots where they most harmoniously blended with the nearby woods ,rocks and streams so that the man-built structures and natural elements complimented each other. That is also the "oneness of heaven and man" and the "way of nature" Taoism pursues.The Gold Hall,built in 1416 on the top of the Heavenly Pillar Peak,is the largest copper structure existing in the country. It is 5 .54 meters tall and 5.R meters wide. The walls were cast separately,but precisely and well knit. All the statues of god and sacrificial vessels are made of copper. Although 500 odd years have past,they still glitter as before.
