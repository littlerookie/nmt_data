Caitlin, why don't you go back inside.
Taylor, I'm sorry.
I'm not crazy, right?
last night, you did tell me you loved me.
Yeah, I did.
okay, then what? Are you trying to send me a message?
do you wish you hadn't said it?
no. Last night when I told you...
you mentioned going to Berkeley.
God, I knew it.
Ryan, yes, I applied to Berkeley months ago.
before you and I ever started dating.
Oh.
and then, this, you and I happened, and I thought, I don't know, maybe.
and I guess I should have told you, but I really needed to know exactly how you felt first.
I just think our planning to go to college together, it's a big decision.
would you have said you loved me if you'd known I'd gotten in to Berkeley?
great.
wow, okay.
I'm just going to go.
she's coming.
happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Taylor Happy birthday to you.
come on. This is where you blow out the candles and make a wish.
sorry
don't worry.
Kirsten and I will square up things here.
all right, great. Thanks.
and I gave Seth the car to help carry the presents.
so where you going now?
uh, I don't know.
I'll see you later.
Hey. You okay?
Yeah. Sure.
but by the looks of it, you and I aren't going to be brother and sister any time soon.
Oh, no. What happened?
honestly? It was me.
I mean, look, Ryan, I have absolutely nothing against your dad.
it's just I really didn't want to rush into an insta-family again.
I mean, how long would this one last? Like a month?
well, you never know.
I, uh, moved in with the Cohens and I gave it a week.
here I am.
I just wish there was a way you could tell if it was all going to work out.
Yeah, but there isn't.
but I promise you, I will always be your brother, in a completely, non-creepy way.
Caitlin, honey, could I talk to you?
Yeah.
wait, Ryan, as your sister, if you don't tell Taylor that you love her, you're an idiot.
Oh.
she's right.
I just wanted him to get excited about something, you know?
anything.
just give him a chance. - Oh, no.
Seth, I'm so sorry you had to overhear that.
no, it's all right. I mean it's true.
what I was going to say is, I think what you made is really good.
Yeah, there's no coherent theme.
most of the shots are too wide and the Dogma thing has been done to death.
but you know, I get that you wanted me to find something that I'm passionate about, the way you're passionate about the environment.
but you love movies.
I do. I love going to them and then telling people what's wrong with them.
what is it?
I could be a critic.
you mean spending your whole life watching movies and telling people how terrible they are?
Yeah, that sounds awesome.
I just want you to find something that you really care about.
you want to go rent An Inconvenient Truth?
Yes, I love that movie.
I just want to count the number of gratuitously soulful shots of Al Gore staring out an airplane window.
do not insult Al Gore.
so what did you tell Frank?
I told him we needed to slow it down.
mom, if you really like him...
I do.
and he's not going away.
but I told him that right now I need to be spending some time with my daughter.
does that include buying me ice cream?
Absolutely.
the hermit?
my soul card's the hermit? Are you kidding me?
okay, Esmerelda, I'd better go. I guess I'll call you next year.
come in.
Hey, I hope I'm not interrupting.
no.
I got you something.
okay...
wait, these are all poems that I've translated.
I collected them, recopied them, had them bound.
Ryan, this is amazing.
are you sure this is from you?
Taylor, I'm sorry.
I- I freaked out.
what I said last night, I meant.
Really?
I love you.
and I don't want to lose you.
so let's put it all on the table.
berkeley, Paris, Oxford, anything.
I don't know what to say.
that's a first.
Oh, my God, Mom. It's okay, it's just...
it's an earthquake. Get in here. Mom!
are you sure about this Julie Cooper
she's got all the right connections and nothing left to lose.
we want to throw a charity event
sounds like a wonderful course you were just gonna scam me into throwing fake charity, leave me to pick up the pieces
what if you help me?
so do you mind if I, um, join you for some pizza?
Taylor, it's Summer! Open up!
I can't hear you.
I've been dodging this business for the last 20 years.
stay away
I am sorry , but movie sucked
master of the Flying Guillotine?
it's a classic of the genre.
it's like the Madame Bovary of martial arts cinema.
wait, the flying guillotine.
was that the spiky hat thing he threw?
Yeah. Dude, I'm sorry, but that was kind of weak.
et tu, Ryan?
it didn't even make sense.
why was he going after the one-armed boxer? Poor guy.
uh, revenge. It's a tale as old as time.
maybe the girls should pick the movie next time.
what do you say? - Yes.
do I have to remind you about the Bring It On phase?
now that is an awesome movie.
I'm sexy, I'm cute, I'm popular to boot, I said I'm bitchin', great hair. So the boys all love to stare...
dude, what' d I say?
ten to one our boys hang out at the candy-ass diner on the pier.
that's want I love about you rich kids.
so predictable. What do you want?
I got to spell it out for you?
I want a rematch.
somewhere private.
just me kicking your ass.
I'm not looking for trouble.
maybe you should've thought of that before jumping me the other night.
what, like you didn't start it by hooking up with someone else' s girlfriend?
good point.
or that's unnecessary continuity.
either or.
look, guys, this is so stupid.
I got nothing against you.
Ah, that's too bad.
cause me and you, we got unfinished business.
see you, guys.
Hey, baby.
I need your opinion.
which of these scream "real estate mogul with a heart of gold"?
the blue.
and "sensitive, street smart man of talent and mystery"?
the blue.
all right. Blue it is.
sandy, you're going to do great.
the Newport Group's lucky to have you.
Oh, I just want to make a good impression on my first day.
Hey, how's that charity thing coming?
Oh, it's coming.
I've just never thrown together something so quickly.
I hope Julie and Charlotte aren't out getting mystics while you're doing all the work.
don't worry. They're working.
they're busy with the foundation.
Oh, good question.
booze or no booze? - Oh, tough call.
a fund-raiser for poor women with substance abuse problems.
I know, it's going to be weird if people are drinking.
Yeah, then again, people are a lot more generous when they've got a couple of shots under their belt.
booze.
morning.
Oh, hey, boys.
on Sunday, I would love some help with the party.
Sunday?
sunday, yeah, it's going to be tough.
it's going to be tough.
Yeah, no problem.
Thanks, Ryan.
well, I should get going.
I have to meet Charlotte and Julie at the club.
Hey, what is so incredibly pressing on a Sunday?
Oh, it's the Sabbath, Dad.
it's a day of rest, you know?
I don't make the rules.
talk to the Big Guy.
I thought the Sabbath was Saturday?
listen to me.
this is the first publ thing your mother has done since rehab.
so we are going to do everything in our power to make it a success, understood?
mom, listen, Sunday, I'm going to be there, okay?
provided I don't get struck down by lightning bolts.
Thanks, Seth. That means a lot.
such generosity.
Oh, there goes the back.
no, I'll be all right.
I'll be fine. I can probably lift stuff.
I just feel responsible.
I mean, if I hadn't introduced Ryan to Johnny in the first place, then he never would have gotten in a fight with that jerk.
well, if you want to blame someone why not Casey for hooking up with the surf nazi to begin with.
I know. I still can't believe she did that.
um... she had a reason.
I'm sorry.
have you asked him yet?
right, I'll just say,"Hey, Johnny."
Casey thinks you're in love with me.
and then, best case scenario, he says no.
and our relationship is totally weird if not ruined.
what if he is?
then our friendship is totally weird if not ruined.
he hasn't done anything to make me think that.
so, excuse me for not believing his psycho girlfriend.
hmm. Ex-girlfriend.
Yeah, he's single now, remember?
I'll see you later.
dude, all I'm saying is you just got back into Harvard, okay?
you do not want to go back to the wasteland of home-schooling.
and I told you, I'm not going to fight him.
Yeah, I hear you and I want to believe you.
but I also know Kid China.
sometimes when his back's up against the wall and his fists of fury...
Yeah, Kid China is retired. He hung up the hoodie.
so just relax, all right?
Hey, Taylor. How's it going?
it's going great.
I cannot tell you how many people have come up and told me how awesome they thought lock-in was.
you know what, every single one mentions Capture the Flag.
did you know he was All Camp Takahoe.
he might've mentioned it.
told you it'd be fun. - It was. It was.
and it was all because of you, too.
he took the lead in everything.
I mean with the trust falls and the S'more making and share time.
your story about Captain Oats.
Ah, yeah, we had to tell a story about our best friend growing up.
and it was so insensitive of those guys to laugh, too.
cause your story wasn't nearly as lame as Derrick Simmons befriending the deaf kid.
but Seth, I wanted to ask you, what do you think about planning the Christmas dance together?
the Christmas dance? You and me?
we made such a good team.
Oh, wow, yeah.
well, that... you should talk to Summer.
your girlfriend?
Yeah, because did like a fantastic job at the last one.
and I just think that you guys would, would...
there she is right over there.
you can talk to her about it yourself.
okay, forget it. I got to go.
Ooh, boy, you're in trouble.
what? What do you mean?
you're in trouble. - That? I mean, I was nice to her.
so that's what that's about. - You keep telling yourself that, yeah.
Hey.
what were you doing talking to her?
did you forget that she didn't let me into the lock-in?
I totally bruised my hand pounding on that door.
she probably didn't know it was you. - No, she knew it was me.
she just didn't want to let me in.
I wonder why.
what... what's that supposed to mean?
we should take out half these tables so we can have more flow.
we should also talk to them about the music.
the last event I did here, they had us on a Kenny G loop.
can I just tell you how excited I am?
this is going to be so wonderful.
I'm so glad you suggested it.
Oh, there's a manager.
I'm going to find out what time we can be here on Sunday and set up.
so, where are we?
130 RSVPs at $5,000 a head.
that's over $600,000.
$300,000 apiece.
tell me again I have to do this.
Julie, you have two daughters, no husband and no money.
you're about to get $300,000.
Oh, yeah.
I'm totally doing this.
he says we can be here at 8: 00.
Ryan. Hi.
going this way?
Yeah.
so, you're like Seth's best friend, right?
don't tell Captain Oats. - That's funny.
I didn't know that you were funny.
so, Seth and Summer seem happy.
I mean, I know they had that trouble last year, but, um, they seem stable.
wouldn't you say that they're stable?
of course, though, I mean, look at Brad and Jen.
everybody thought that they were stable.
but nobody knew how unhappy Brad was.
that he was just waiting for Angelina to come rescue him.
they're stable. - How stable? One to ten.
uh, excuse me?
on a scale of one to ten. - Right
how stable are they?
sucks for Angelina.
then again...things happen, don't they?
I bet Brad and Jen used to be a ten.
Bye.
I wanted to welcome you all on our first day.
Matt, have you had a chance to meet everyone?
not yet.
I wanted to go over what's changed.
the Newport Group will still develop residential and commercial properties.
with this alteration
one quarter of our new housing projects will be low income.
we are not just catering to the mansion crowd anymore.
although we do need their money to stay in business.
and the other thing that's changed is us.
Matt will be a Vice President and Director of Development, which will leave me as President and CEO.
and despite the fact that I've watched my lovely wife do this job for the past 15 years,
I'm new at this.
and I'm going to need your help.
well, stop milling around and get back to work.
thank you everybody.
nice speech. - That's nothing.
catch me with a microphone in my hand.
you should try to meet everyone.
they'd appreciate it. - Oh, yeah.
Hi. Matt Ramsey. Good to meet you.
you're fired.
so I take it your meeting with the accountant yesterday didn't go so well.
the word "unsustainable" was used a lot.
we have to lose nine people. - Nine?
that's a little extreme.
well, you have to look at the numbers.
for now, we sit tight.
we're here one day.
the first order of business is not going to be firing half the staff.
well, you're the boss.
I have a meeting about the zoning on Crestmont.
let me know what you come up with.
I'm only telling you so you can be on the lookout, okay?
cause this guy is crazy.
gotcha. I'll be on Amber alert.
Oh, and don't tell Johnny. He might do something stupid.
Hey, say no more. It'll be our little secret. Okay.
and if maybe sharing that secret maybe brings us closer together, creates a bond, we'll roll with that, too.
Uh-huh. Just don't tell Johnny, okay?
tell me what? - Johnny.
Hey! How are you?
I'm good. Tell me what?
um, no offense, man.
this is kind of just between me and Marissa.
the cold check is in. What are you doing?
nothing!
come on, man, you guys are tearing me apart here.
okay, look, he tried to get Ryan to fight him.
but nothing happened so...
Ugh, hold these.
Johnny, wait.
look, this isn't Ryan's fight. - So what are you gonna do?
go knock on this guy's door and say "Hey, fight me" instead?
I'm not gonna sit back and let your boyfriend take the heat for my problem.
I'm not letting either of you guys get in a fight.
Marissa, that's not the point. - What is it with you two?
I'm so sick of this.
Ryan has nothing to do with this.
you know what? It's fine.
whatever. Just do whatever you want.
okay. I won't fight him.
Seriously?
fighting a guy's one thing.
when it comes to upsetting a lady, I'm a total coward.
you win.
look, we'd better get to class.
I'm serious.
do you have any idea what Summer will do if she finds out?
Yeah, I can imagine.
I have to tell Taylor it's not gonna happen.
even if I didn't love Summer, her and I were totally incompatible, seeing as how she's crazy and I'm not.
well, I thought you said she wasn't that bad.
Taylor Townsend? - Yeah.
in fourth grade she campaigned against making the school handicapped accessible.
she said it was reverse Darwinism.
besides, who...who wants Dean Hess' s seconds?
Oh, look. A picnic on our car.
hmm, it's you guys.
finally.
Seth, get security.
Yeah, well, maybe we'll go get them together.
mm, security?
we're just talking.
I mean, nothing's gonna happen.
Oh... It's all right.
it's just a little soap and I'm not gonna fight you.
did you hear that?
rich boy doesn't want to get his hands dirty.
is your butler around? Maybe he'll fight me.
I got it. We're all strangers.
okay, so let's take a step back for a second.
I'm Seth. I like comic books.
you obviously like, uh, flaming heart tattoos.
I think you do got it in you.
in fact, I think you're just itching to throw down.
I just gotta find the key.
uh, uh, oh, look what I found.
you know what I just realized, though?
she doesn't have a name.
I'm gonna call her Little Bitch.
excuse me.
just keep walking.
this ain't over.
Hi.
Hey.
we having breakfast this morning?
so, Summer told me what happened yesterday with your truck.
Ah, yes.
Seth kept a secret a whole 12 hours.
must be a record.
Yeah, you know, it's...I didn't want to worry you.
well, I'm proud of you for not fighting.
I know it must have been hard.
Yeah, you have no idea.
that guy's a total jackass.
what are you doing?
what are all these tools?
you want to see? Come on.
just don't overreact.
a punching bag.
Yeah, Sandy had it in the garage.
said I could use it.
so you could train to fight him?
no, I'm not gonna fight him. I didn't yesterday, remember?
then what's it for?
therapy.
okay.
I just don't want any more fighting.
how's he doing?
you mean about Casey?
well, Seth's going to the Bait Shop tonight.
why don't you invite Johnny?
take his mind off things.
sure.
now what about breakfast? - Definitely. Definitely.
I'll meet you inside. I gotta clean up.
okay. - All right.
you can't deliver at 4: 00.
by the time the guests arrive, they'll be pudding.
and I can't have pudding.
six will be fine.
thank you.
Ah, sweet charity.
I am hereby calling the next three hours Kirsten time.
I am going to the gym,
I am getting my nails done and everything else can wait.
good for you.
you left early this morning?
Yeah. You know, nothing like a little dawn patrol to clear your head.
is everything okay?
I was so busy yesterday, I forgot to ask how your first day went.
Oh, it's good. It's good.
it's uh, you know, just a... just a lot.
well, you can always come to me with questions.
Thanks.
you go have your Kirsten time.
come in.
hi Seth.
Taylor, hey.
what are, what are you doing here?
Oh, your Mom let me in.
she seems really, really nice.
wow, your room is really cute.
look, can we talk?
Yeah, okay, but before you say anything...
I like you. - Ah, boy.
I know. It totally surprised me, too, because I don't usually go for the R.Crumb type, but he heart has its own magic.
um... um... yeah.
well, I'm with Summer, though, so
I heard you were breaking up. - What? Who said that?
I made it up.
but what did you feel when you heard it?
relief? - No.
listen, Taylor, even if I was single, uh...I'm not so sure that you and I would make a great match. I mean...
is that a Yakuza Prep poster?
Yeah, it's just this Japanese film about these prep school kids...
Yeah, yes. It's like my favorite movie of all time!
I think Kenji Yamamoto was a genius.
Really? - Yes!
have you seen his samurai assassination series?
battles on the Edge of Hell? I own the criterion collection.
Oh, my God. You like comic books?
comics are geek wacky material.
but, look, Seth.
I mean it's obvious that we are soul mates.
all you have to do is break up with Summer.
right, well, I'm not gonna be able to do that, so...
I see.
excuse me.
Hello?
Hey, what time do we have to be there tonight?
Yeah, I think we should be at the Bait Shop by, like, 8:00.
I'll see you later, Seth.
who was that? That sounded like girl.
did it? But yeah.
well, sure.
because I'm listening to the radio and This American Life is on and so, it was a girl talking.
Oh, is that that show by those hipster know-it-alls who talk about how fascinating ordinary people are?
Ugh, God!
Uh-huh, yeah.
Hello?
did you get the tickets?
Yep, San Juan, Puerto Rico, where your ill-gotten dollar goes farther.
how's your roomie holding up?
well, she still thinks she's getting half the money and a free condo.
Wow. You almost feel bad for her.
Yeah, almost.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
I just don't think we should sign.
Hey, what's the problem?
Oh, they want us to sign a liability agreement.
but then you'd be responsible.
I'm happy to do it. - What could happen?
exactly.
there, it's done.
I'm gonna give this to a manager.
it's as if somebody steps a toe. It doesn't mean anything.
I know. I'm just... nervous.
look, as soon as I skip town, everybody is gonna blame me.
you're gonna be fine. - What about Kirsten?
well, she's gonna be very hurt.
and she's gonna need her best friend.
right.
you wanted to see me? - Yeah.
I spent the morning with our accountant going over the numbers and you're right.
in order for this company to be as strong as possible, we have to lose nine people.
for once, I wish I was wrong.
but I'm still not doing it.
I came up with a plan.
we restructure our loans, eliminate the perks, cut my salary by 30 percent.
we let four people go, it'll get us by
but this-this leaves us no margin.
if one deal goes down...
then we go down.
but as long as I'm running this company, that's how we're gonna do it.
Hey, it was not a pity invite. Okay?
tell him.
Yeah, no.
we, uh, we thought you might like to see the band.
well, so you weren't worried
I'd be home alone all weekend thinking about Casey?
no. - That's crazy.
no, but seriously what are you doing tomorrow because my mom's having a fund-raising.
Yeah, if you want, Seth and I could use your help.
Yeah, well, they're counting on Seth.
they definitely need your help.
well, you guys are so not subtle.
I appreciate it.
Thanks.
Hey. Hey, buddy...
I used to work here.
Hello, Seth.
Taylor. Hey!
is Summer here?
okay, look, I love Summer.
I always have.
now, while you and I may share an appreciation for ultra-violent ancient cinema, - there's no way... - What's going on?
tell me you just heard what I was saying.
Hi, Summer. You look really cute.
I know. But more importantly, why are you always talking to my boyfriend?
she likes Yakuza... Never mind.
well, maybe I should just get going.
Oh, oh, um, I almost forgot.
here.
thanks for letting me borrow him.
it really means a lot to me that you trust me.
Bye.
you let her borrow Captain Oats?!
I didn't let her borrow anything.
she must have taken it from me when she was in my room.
when was she in your room?!
that was her when I was on the phone?
something happened at the lock-in.
you're such a jerk!
leaving already, bro?
Harper, what's up?
how's your girlfriend dog?
no, don't. He's not worth it.
get out of the way, man.
or what?
you're not going to fight me, I know that.
but she might shoot you. She has before.
is that true, bro?
you let your girlfriend do your fighting for you?
hold up, girl.
don't you touch her.
so that's what gets you going.
you, out!
Hey.
Hi.
Hey, Kirsten's already over at the yacht club.
once you and Mr. Sabbath have breakfast, we should head over there and start setting up.
great. Can I talk to you about something?
any time.
there's this guy, and he's gotten it in his head that he's going to fight me.
does this have anything to do with the fact that my car is now the "Little Bitch"?
maybe. I was going to fix that.
forget about it.
that there's enough to go to the cops.
Yeah.
do you want me to talk to him?
no. No offense, but I don't see this guy getting scared.
you know you can't get into another fight.
no, I know. And I've been trying to walk away.
you're using your brains instead of your fists, good.
I mean, how does it help me with this guy?
you got to keep walking away, 'cause whatever' s making him angry, it isn't you.
Oh, hang on just a minute.
Hey, Mark. It's a little early on a Sunday morning.
today?
no, you don't do anything till I get there.
all right.
you and Seth are going to have to go to the club without me.
I'll catch up later.
I'll have my phone if you need me.
I can't believe you dragged me out of bed for this.
this is the worst idea ever.
there's no other way.
okay, but seriously, you don't know Volchek.
last year, some guy snaked his wave, so he went up on the pier and dropped a kitchen sink on him.
where do you even get a kitchen sink?
Yeah, well, if you're so concerned, why don't you stay in the car?
I'm just saying maybe we could bring some muscle besides the muscle that I already provided.
yo, yo, yo, check it out.
Oh, hey, look who's here.
now, don't shoot.
Hey, dork.
Hey.
look, I want you to leave Ryan alone.
Oh, so it's bribes now?
well, I got watch; K-Mart,$15. 99.
well, this is Cartier, and I got it for my 16th birthday.
it's worth, like four grand.
damn, you must really think I might hurt him.
do we have a deal?
sure. I'll leave your little boy alone.
all right.
if I see you around again, I'm going to tell the cops you stole that.
you do that.
don't put them in direct sunlight because when the water starts to heat up, then the flowers, they, they wilt.
do you, do you think there's too much red?
Hey, Kirsten. - Oh, hey.
what's up?
just giving final instruction.
Oh, I know I'm going a little crazy, but I just want everything to be perfect.
it will be, won't it?
Yeah, of course. It'll be fantastic.
Thanks, Julie.
I am so glad we're doing this together.
me, too.
what the hell are you doing? - Let me explain.
forget going behind my back.
you called people in on a Sunday to fire them.
is that what they teach you in business school so you don't lose time during the week?
listen, I just thought it'd be better now than on Monday when they have to face the humiliation of packing up in front of their co-workers.
and I didn't go behind your back.
Really?
because as much as I appreciate the heads-up phone call that you're about to fire four of our employees, I don't recall every agreeing to this.
we agreed we had to let them go.
I just thought that if I did it myself, I would spare you the pain, that's all.
for the record, I don't let people do my dirty work for me.
where are they?
they're in your office.
it's all right, Matt.
now go home. It's Sunday.
listen to me. Nothing happened at the lock-in.
and yet you still felt the need to lie about her being in your room?
because I knew how you'd react.
not that it's your fault. I'm saying it's my fault.
it's definitely my fault.
you know what is my fault?
what? - That!
Ow!
listen, man, I'm really sorry about this whole Volchek thing.
Ah, it's not your fault.
guys like Volchek are looking for any excuse.
sounds like you've been in this situation before.
Ah, it feels like every week.
look, if anything goes down, I'm there.
well, thanks, but I'm hoping it doesn't come to that.
sometimes you don't have a choice.
Julie, you're not dressed.
need to leave in a few minutes.
I don't think I can do this.
you're worried about Kirsten getting hurt.
Kirsten, my son.
even if they blame you.
I see. Well, what if they blame you?
what?
what if I call the police and tell them how we created a fake charity to defraud your friends.
Charlotte, they'd arrest you.
Yeah, they have to find me first.
Plus, I think you might a little easier to track down.
could you do jail, Julie?
and if you did, which one of your former friends would be there to help you when you get out?
now get dressed.
we don't want to be late for the party.
do you think Taylor's pretty?
well, I mean, I know she's not prettier than me, but, like, objectively speaking.
objectively speaking, I think Seth loves you, and you've got nothing to worry about.
go put these on the table.
he told me to give you this.
he changed his mind. He wants cash.
but he can sell that.
tell him yourself. He's in the parking lot.
we had a deal.
pawnshop ain't open. I need cash now.
I owe a guy some money.
well, I don't have $4,000.
lucky for you all I need is a couple hundred.
come on. You got an ATM card, don't you?
screw it. Your boyfriend inside, hmm?
okay.
fine, I'll go.
let's go.
I am so glad that you both could come.
but you know what? You should watch those ahi rolls, Chuck, or we'll be treating you for substance abuse.
Oh, excuse me. Nice to see you.
well, you don't miss a beat.
Oh, well, you know, just like riding a bike.
Julie, I really want to thank you.
for what?
making me do this.
I wasn't sure that I was ready.
but having your support, I just wish my dad could see us.
he'd be so proud.
I thought you said you'd have friends here tonight.
they're just not here yet.
I don't want another evening of you sitting alone in the corner reading The Economist.
it's embarrassing.
they're going to be here.
well, excuse me if I don't hold my breath.
sorry I'm late. Hi. Seth Cohen.
Veronica Townsend. Nice to meet you.
Taylor, is this the young man you brought the present for?
mom...
well, give it to him.
she must have wrapped it and re-wrapped it four times before we left the house.
okay, fine.
Oh, wow, that's, you know...
how did you get this?
I thought they only released it in Japan.
Yeah, my cousin works for Christie' s in Tokyo and he sends me DVDs.
I don't know. I just thought you would like it.
it's amazing.
well, I'll just let you two be alone.
this is like so...
go away, Seth!
I don't need you feeling sorry for me.
I don't.
well, why not?
you heard her: "She's horrible."
she's always saying the same things.
why don't people like you, Taylor?
why aren't you popular, Taylor?
why don't you have friends, Taylor?
well, she doesn't know what she's talking about.
Yeah, but that's just it. She does.
I live in this dream world where I think that Summer is my friend, and I think that you like me.
and the truth is, I don't have anybody.
Oh, my God, if the Grinch had that stupid little dog.
you think Summer's your friend?
Yes, I know, I'm crazy.
you know what? I like you.
no, you don't. - Yes, I do.
you pity me...
no, I really do. - It's different.
I think you're funny.
stop teasing me.
I'm not. Listen to me. I'm serious.
you got great taste in movies.
I think you're smart.
I think you're interesting.
Really?
Yeah. And if you just relaxed a little bit, I think other people would see that, you know?
they'd see that you're... one of a kind.
Yeah, but I've actually got to head back in right now, so...
Seth, I... - No, no, it's just because, uh, I think Summer may be looking for me.
and you know, if she was to come out here and see us talking...
so, uh... we're gonna talk at school.
okay. - Okay.
okay, good. - Okay.
but I feel really good about this.
it's happening.
what's up, an?
Hey.
this party's unbelievable.
like something in a movie. - Yeah, I know the feeling.
you haven't seen Marissa, have you?
no... but I just got here.
Why? What's up?
nothing. Just...Saw her a little while ago, but...
eh, guess who?
Hey, where are you?
well, right now... I'm with your girlfriend.
are you there, little bitch?
Ah, I'm here.
she's fine.
but she does miss you, so why don't you come get her?
we're underneath the pier.
Volchek's got her.
you should call the cops.
Yeah. You call them. I'm going to finish this.
Hi.
I've raised over $300,000 in pledges.
Oh, that's great. I think Julie's doing even better.
I wouldn't be surprised if we hit a million.
Oh, where is she? I haven't seen her in a while.
I don't know.
excuse me.
uh, excuse me, may I have your attention over here, please?
I'm Julie Cooper-Nichol.
its so great to see all your faces.
and I just want to thank you so much for coming here.
with your assistance, we are going to be able to help a great many women in need.
thank you, uh... however, as you write your checks, I would ask that you make them out to "The National Foundation for Substance Abuse."
as it so happens, your generosity has somewhat overwhelmed our small organization, and with the National Foundation's network, your money will go a lot further.
and still be tax-deductible.
so, thank you very much.
did you know about this?
no, I... I'll go talk to her.
okay.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
Oh, could you not hear me?
I always hold the mic too far away.
I wasn't kidding about the police, Juli
now you get back over there and you tell everyone it was a mistake.
call them.
what?
call the police.
I thought so.
Oh, what? You think you're back in society now so you don't need the money?
wake up, Julie.
these people are never going to accept you.
you don't have any friends here.
wrong. I have Kirsten.
and I won't do this to her.
now... I think it's time you left.
don't you?
this town's only really big enough for one manipulative bitch.
take care, sweetie.
where have you been?
just because I'm not talking to you doesn't mean you're allowed out of my sight.
no, I was in the parking lot.
you were in the parking lot?
why were you in the parking？
yakuza? Were you with Taylor?
she's having an emotional crisis.
Yeah, well, she is about to have a physical one.
summer... she thinks you're her friend.
what? She is crazy. I hate her.
I know. You along with everyone else.
look, this whole thing started because the other day, I was at the Lock-In, and I saw how awful her mother is.
so you know what? I was nice to her.
okay, so that's the problem. That you were too nice.
well, she's not used to it.
I think she's overreacting a little bit.
she's just really lonely.
well, she doesn't make it easy to be nice to.
I know.
just don't ever lie to me again. Okay?
I won't, I swear.
how badly do you want to go home right now and watch that movie?
so bad it may actually kill me.
come on.
dude, this is a bad idea.
last year, Volchek almost killed this guy.
I know what I'm doing.
would you mind telling me what that is?
I'm going to try and use my head, for once.
with Volchek? - Just trust me.
whatever happens, go with it.
all right.
if that doesn't work?
grab Marissa and run.
Aw, here comes your boy.
whoa, whoa, slow down, bro.
you all right? Yeah. I'm okay.
I said she can go, but she wanted to stay.
check it out. You brought Harper.
you want some when I'm through with him?
let's do it now.
Ryan! Whoa, bro! Come on, now, let's...let's not get crazy, man.
you don't want to do this.
Oh, you're giving me advice now? Come on!
come on.
Ryan? Stay out of it!
come on!
dude... dude... You don't know what you're doing.
I've been fighting guys like you for years.
you want to bash my face in 'cause your life sucks? Fine!
but you want to fight, you're gonna have to kill me.
so, what's it gonna be?
come on! - All right!
all right.
let's go, man.
guy's crazy.
Hey.
Hey.
have a seat.
so the event was a success.
Congratulations. - Thank you.
so you want to tell me what's going on?
what do you mean?
don't shut me out, Sandy.
I fired four people today.
I'm not sure I'm the guy for this job at all.
I'm glad you're upset.
good pep talk. - Means you care.
do you think my father gave a second thought to someone he fired?
exactly. He was successful.
and his ego almost destroyed the company.
if I had to choose between you and my father to run things, I would choose you every time.
thank you, baby.
I'm not fragile.
you don't have to protect me.
I forget you are your father's daughter.
no. I'm yo wife.
good answer.
that was intense.
you really wanted to hit him, huh?
no, no...
no, I'm fine.
well, I didn't hit him, and I think that's the most important thing.
Yeah, it is.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
Nah, you had plenty of evidence to back you up.
Yeah, but you've changed.
you're like a totally different Ryan Atwood.
was the old one so bad?
no, no, just darker.
he scared me sometimes.
Yeah. Me, too.
all right, I should head home.
I've got school in the morning.
you and me gonna have to pull Summer away from that Yakuza movie.
Oh, somehow, I think I'll manage.
Hey, I'm proud of you.
why aren't I surprised?
I couldn't agree with you more.
brains, beauty...
the surgeon that you hooked him up with, he convinced the guy that Johnny would make a full recovery and he's back on the team.
thank you.
she deserves to be happy.
I'm taking Caitlin to go look at new ponies.
whatever no longer fits, we'll just send it to your sister.
thank God, Caitlin's going away to boarding school.
this is no environment for a child.
it's just not right for a little girl to love a hairless pony.
why do you keep touching your face?
last night, before I went to bed, I had this sensation of a pimple about to surface.
this morning, the skin's as clear as a smogless sky.
and that's a problem?
Ryan, don't you see?
not so much.
things are going way too well around here.
what?
marissa got back into Harbor.
you guys seemed to resolve your surf-tastic love triangle.
my girlfriend got a near-perfect score on her SATs, but we've never been happier.
Seth, it's senior year. It's supposed to be a best year ever.
no, you should know better. Every time things are going to well around here, it's when doom comes a-knocking.
doom? - A-knocking.
or a ringing.
right on time. Don't answer it.
it's probably a flaming bag of crap.
or FedEx.
Yeah.
so, I show up at my house to surprise my mom.
and this Persian dude answers the door.
uh, I'm sorry?
I figured he was the new butler.
but then I saw his shoes, Prada.
I thought maybe he's my new stepdad.
and I was about to, like, hug him and then his wife shows up.
no matter how rich the guy is, my mother would never join a harem.
uh, I don't...
so I was like, "Persian dude, what are you doing at my house?"
and where is my mother?
and he was all like, "Who's your mother?"
so I told him.
and he tells me that my mother moved and that all the mail is being forwarded here.
uh, I think that you may...
are you gonna invite me in or what?
I see Newport hasn't improved your manners at all.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Kaitlin Cooper?
weird neighborhood kid, hi!
you've, uh... I mean, you've grown...
boobs?
no, I...
the SISTER ACT
it must be two years since she's been back.
did she mention why she's home in the middle of a semester?
we never really got past where home was.
Oh, Julie wants us to wait till she gets here before we tell Kaitlin...
that her family's a prime candidate for Pimp My Double-wide?
Hey, guys. Good morning. - Good morning.
you ready to go? It's the third day of the Pride and Prejudice miniseries in English class.
summer, the show you're about to see has all the makings of a classic Jane Austen novel.
you've got sisters, lies and bosoms.
Kaitlin's back.
Mini-Cooper?
Mini-Coop not so mini.
Where's my baby?
she's getting herself together.
the kid's a little confused.
I don't know what I'm gonna tell her.
I mean, I just wanted to protect her from everything that's gone on around here.
shootings, funerals, public school.
well just explain it to her. She'll understand.
honey, you might've understood. You're your father's daughter.
Kaitlin's me. She's not gonna want our life.
she came home.
and that means she wants her family more than anything.
mom?
Oh, baby.
Hi. - Hi.
sweetie, what are you doing here?
do you even look at my calendar?
it's mid-winter break.
I knew that.
it's just, I figured... Isn't it Fashion Week?
I thought you'd be in Paris with Alex, like last year.
front row at Chanel. I saw the photo on Wire Image.
I thought that you'd be happy to see me.
well, I am. Of course.
Hey, we're so happy to see you.
so that guy, Caleb, said that you moved.
I think we're gonna be late for school, guys.
sandy, can I talk to you about the launch party?
Oh, I love discussing a party.
I'm actually gonna be late for school, too, but let's do something later and catch up, okay?
Bye. - Bye.
okay, so what's going on?
okay, do you remember that e-mail that I sent you about Caleb?
there were some financial complications afterwards.
Oh, my God.
we live in a trailer.
well, yes.
um, we're more like refugees.
we're only half a mile from the beach, and well, it's Tiffany blue.
Oh, honey, this is so temporary.
once Kirsten's and my business is up and running, everything's gonna be just like it was.
so let's go inside.
and then you pull it open like this... and... voila!
it's a bed.
Wow...that's versatile.
Oh, honey.
I'm sorry. I know this isn't what you're used to, but think of it as a life experience.
and this is exactly the kind of place Britney Spears is from.
mom, it's okay. Really.
I mean, it's like a slumber party. The three of us.
here.
Oh, you still have this puppy Marissa gave you.
although you didn't really care for him until you found out he was a purse and you could put your pretend credit cards in his belly.
Yeah, it was that Summer in Tahoe.
the whole family together.
I guess it's sentimental.
I know, let's get our nails done.
I want to hear everything you've been up to in Montecito.
although I'm supposed to be helping Kirsten with our launch... but she'll understand.
you got a message?
somebody from school?
a boy? Hmm...?
Oh, my little girl's growing up.
I'm gonna call Kirsten.
Hey, it's me.
I can't believe you just took off like that.
don't think just because you left town, I'm not gonna...
it's just the Kaitlin I know is obsessed with her hairless pony.
I feel like I missed this whole part of her life.
what, puberty?
and it's all my fault.
Nah, what are you talking about?
well, I mean, it's not like I ever tried to keep in touch.
in fact, we were never really close.
it was always her and my mom versus me and my dad.
well, she's home now. You can fix that.
are you talking about Kaitlin's transformation from horsy-tweener to lanky-limb jail bait?
cohen, one more perky word about Coop's not-so-Mini-Coop, and I may have to staple your tongue to your collar.
Hey, there you are! Hi.
Hey, Taylor. Oh.
thanks so much for everything at that meeting last week.
Oh, of course.
you were lonely at that school. You had no friends, no one to talk to.
kind of like Charlton Heston in Planet of the Apes.
I think that was Mark Wahlberg.
actually, I had a couple good friends.
but not like our group here.
right?
I should get to class.
uh, me, too.
the poor thing.
thankfully she has us.
Hey, you all right?
Taylor can be a little Taylor.
no, she just made me realize I haven't talked to Johnny since I got here.
I mean, I've left him messages.
the tour starts soon. I hope he hasn't left yet.
Nah, I don't think he'd do that.
why don't you try, uh, what's-his-name, Bizarro Seth.
well, I could. Thanks.
Yeah, no problem. All right, see you at lunch.
dude, will you please just call her back?
this whole sacrificing-your-happiness-for-hers thing clearly is not working.
no, it wasn't a sacrifice, all right?
I just thought my life would be simpler without her.
Yeah, it's real simpler. You're miserable.
dude, will you please just take my phone and call her?
it's like I summoned her.
Hey, Chili. Have you seen Johnny?
as a matter of fact, Harper is right next to me.
Hey, Marissa.
Hey, I called you a few times. Did you get my messages?
Yeah, sorry. Um, I've just been really busy.
of course, packing and stuff?
Yeah, packing.
okay, well, my sister's in town. I'd love for you to meet her before you leave.
Oh, yeah, I don't know.
um, maybe if I have time.
come on, you're not really gonna leave without saying good-bye?
the diner 4: 30. Please?
I'll see you there.
Veronica? What are you doing here?
Hello, Kirsten.
I hear you and Julie are starting a new dating service.
I want you to set me up with the delicious Dr. Neil Roberts.
the father of Marissa's best friend?
the girl you called Little Miss Columbine at last week's board meeting?
do you really think he'd go out with you?
of course not.
if, however, I could talk to him, say, over a candlelit dinner,
I'm sure I could convince him that I was just a concerned parent looking out for her daughter.
and that's where you come in.
and why would I help you?
Marissa's back at Harbor.
but her involvement in after-school activities
senior Day, prom, graduation-- is yet to be determined.
and I carry a lot of weight with the Parents' Association.
you might say I am the Parents' Association.
you're gonna hold a 17-year-old girl hostage for a date?
a good man is hard to find, Kirsten.
I'm free tomorrow if you're wondering.
Oh, you'll have the contracts by Friday.
Yeah. Oh, it's great, Sid. I'll talk to you then.
well, this is a wonderful surprise.
I wish it was.
sandy, I have a problem.
Veronica Townsend came by to see me this morning.
she wants me to set her up with Neil Roberts.
good luck.
and she threatened to make Marissa's life a living hell at Harbor if I don't.
and she can do it.
we can't give in to threats like that. We don't negotiate with the Newpsies.
I know, but Marissa's been through a lot, and all Neil has to do is take her out for dinner tomorrow night.
well, so, what do you want me to do about it?
you're the one with the dating service.
Neil isn't a client.
and I'm not an employee.
no, but you are Sandy Cohen, professional persuader.
you guys play golf together, and you're guys.
and I'm calling in a wifely favor.
just call.
shopping was such a good idea.
Yeah, even if I was at a thrift store.
Hey, vintage is very in right now.
so who am I meeting again?
Oh, my friend Johnny, from Newport Union.
I guess he's going away on this surfing trip, and I just don't want to lose touch, you know?
do I know about losing touch? Hmm?
mom, in her own deranged way, was just trying to protect you.
and I was... I don't know, but it won't happen again.
Yeah, I know. It's just I'm not a little kid anymore, you know?
I know.
there they are.
which one's Johnny?
perfect bone structure or Carrot Top?
Hey, you're definitely not a kid, huh?
Hey, guys.
Hey.
so, Kaitlin, this is Chili and Johnny.
it's nice to meet you.
Hi.
Hey, Marissa.
Hi.
thanks for coming.
so, uh... when do you leave?
april. - Next week.
right. He leaves next week for training.
tour starts in April.
um... dude, did I lock my car? I think I forgot to lock it.
there's been a lot of thefts in the area lately. He's got a bunch of cassette tapes in there.
can you excuse me?
um... much coffee, small bladder.
what's going on?
Marissa, do I have to spell it out for you?
okay, guess I do.
look, he knew that you weren't going to go back to Harbor while he was still there, so...
he told me that he was leaving.
Oh, my God.
Hey.
so, how long have you been in love with my sister?
we're just friends.
good.
because I'm sure, as you know, she's not available.
unlike, say me.
Hi, uh, is this the Cohen house?
it is. Can I help you?
I'm looking for someone. I guess I had the wrong address.
uh, a Persian guy said I could find her here. Kaitlin Cooper?
you a friend of hers?
I really need to get ahold of her.
is she here or not?
look, man. I haven't seen Kaitlin since she was 11 and rode a pony.
all right. Well, if she shows up, call me.
it's important.
Hey, Ryan.
what's up?
your sister around?
no, she went out.
can I help you?
maybe.
there's this guy showed up at the house last night, looking for you.
you know him?
he's from Montecito and he goes to...
I met him at a mixer.
is he your, uh, boyfriend?
I barely even spoke to the guy.
and he kept on calling me.
coming by my school.
I finally told my dorm mother, and it got him in trouble.
and now he's like, "You're messing up my chances in Princeton."
I can't believe that he showed up here.
I mean, I had already changed my cell phone.
all right, I'll take care of it.
and you won't tell Marissa?
I mean, we're just starting to get to know each other again.
and I don't want her to think that I'm some stalker magnet.
and I don't want her to worry.
Hi.
Hey.
so, Chili... - Told you?
Yeah.
he was never one to keep a secret.
well, what you did was pretty amazing.
I just wanted to thank you.
Yeah, I'm a real martyr.
uh, so what are you gonna do now?
since you're not going on tour.
I hadn't really thought about it.
well, I mean, you could always apply to college for next January.
no, I don't think so.
I could help you.
listen, Marissa.
it's not your problem anymore.
you know, you're back where you belong, and you know, my life, maybe it's not to tour the world to surf, but...
I don't need you saving me.
it's just that you did this incredible thing for me and I...
is that what you think?
I needed you to leave.
so, I'm back at Harbor, but what are you saying?
that you don't ever want to see me again?
Yeah, I guess that's what I'm saying.
right now I just need you out of my life.
okay.
Hello?
Neil, hey! It's Sandy. I-I hope I'm not interrupting.
no, no, no. Not at all, Sandy. How can I help you?
well, there's a bit of a situation with Marissa.
anything I can do? Marissa and her mom mean a lot to me.
well, this is awkward.
you know Veronica Townsend?
do I know Veronica Townsend? Sandy, I know every former A-cup in this town.
well, what would you think about having dinner with her tonight?
you mean a date?
look, I know she is a bitch on wheels, but she wants to go out with you and she's willing to make Marissa's life at Harbor very difficult if it doesn't go through.
Oh, come on Sandy. That's preposterous.
I wouldn't be asking you if I didn't think she'd follow through on this.
look, it's one dinner. Crowded restaurant.
meet there, Kirsten and I'll pick up the tab.
how horrible can it be?
trust me, it'll be horrible.
I owe you.
Thanks.
good, you're here.
Where's Kaitlin?
she came with you, right?
Nah. I didn't think that was a very good idea.
look, best thing for you to do is get in your car, go back where you came from, put this behind you.
I'm not going anywhere without the $1,500 bucks she stole from my brother.
she says she barely knows you.
we've been going out for like a month.
I wanted her to meet my brother, Sam.
he's a Gamma Tau at UCSB.
they were having a party, so I brought her along.
and then she, uh, ditched me, ran off with the door money and left town.
three guys are stuffing a gym bag and take off.
so I'm supposed to take the word of three drunk frat brothers over a 14-year-old girl?
Fourteen?
she told me she was 16.
like I said, put this behind you.
I'm trying to help her.
all right, it's not my money, and now it's out of my hands.
I had three messages from Taylor this morning.
I told you she has abused puppy syndrome.
if you show her the tiniest bit of affection, she's gonna follow you around for the rest of your life.
I know, but she's kind of our responsibility now.
I found you! - Oh, my God!
um, who let you in?
I speak fluent housekeeper.
guess what? My mom's getting set up with your dad!
Oh, my God.
I know, if they get married, we could be sisters.
okay, so I'm gonna go take a quick spin around and see which room I might want.
okay? I'll be right back.
okay.
she is so going back to the pound.
no, no, no. The football players are the real pussycats.
it's the female tennis players that will kill you in your sleep.
you know in Russia, rumor has it that Sharapova's rep is former KGB.
I had no idea being a sport's agent was so dangerous.
mom, this place is way too expensive.
Oh, but, honey, it's your homecoming. It's a special occasion.
mom?
you know where we should go? - Here, you just said so.
the Crab Cooker. We haven't been there in years. It'll be so fun.
but... okay.
Hey.
Hey. Oh, I'm almost ready.
take your time. The movie doesn't start for a while.
okay.
you all right?
I'm trying to find my stupid jacket.
I'll help you.
it's brown with dings on it.
and it's stupid.
I got in a fight with Johnny.
he lied about the surf tour. He was never going.
you knew, didn't you?
Yeah, and I should've told you, but I mean, the guy did a good thing.
he did it to get rid of me!
and, I mean, even though he's not going now, he still says he doesn't ever want to see me again.
okay, but he's in an awkward position.
you gotta respect that. Give him some time.
I know.
look, you, uh... You got your sister back here.
yeah...
I think I do have a great boyfriend.
you have a great boyfriend, too.
and I'm just getting to know my sister.
so, life could be worse.
Hey!
Hey. - Awesome.
Hey, what's up? - Hey.
you seem pensive. Scoot down.
so, Kaitlin is up to something.
dude, I told you, doom.
I know.
all right, hit me with it. What is it?
all right, so this guy showed up looking for her.
and when I asked her about it, she said he'd been stalking her, right.
but when you went to give him the get-out-of-town speech...
he said she stole money from some frat party.
and then I found this bag he described in the trailer.
Oh, she's Jimmy Cooper's daughter. Theft is in her blood.
I want to give her a chance to explain, but...
hey guys, good morning.
Hey, I love how people just come in now.
no more of that useless back and forth through the front door.
so, we're going to go get pancakes. You guys want to come?
uh, actually, Marissa, I'm going to need to borrow you for a second.
cause we're going to have to work on Summer's birthday present.
her birthday's not for like eight months.
what to get the girl that has everything?
we need to plan early.
so, I went to see Justin yesterday.
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
he said you stole some money?
what money? I don't know what you're talking...
I found the bag in your stuff.
okay, so I took it.
but it was for a good reason.
Justin's brother Sam is dating my friend, Megan.
he seemed like the perfect guy, right?
till she told him that she was pregnant.
okay, and then what happened?
so she asked him for some money to, you know, take care of it.
and he said it wasn't his problem.
so I took it.
do you want to call Megan and ask her how her abortion went?
whatever happened, you need to tell Marissa. Okay?
you know I can't tell her. You know how she is.
Seth, I'm sure whichever action figure you choose, Summer will be equally thrilled.
can we go?
you know, I lost my appetite.
can you guys just drop me off on the way?
Yeah, sure.
is everything okay?
morning, sweetheart.
late night last night?
actually, I wanted to tell you I went on a date.
with Veronica Townsend?
How' d you know?
word gets around when Orange County's Cruella nabs her next puppy.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I thought it would just be that one dinner.
what do you mean "you thought"?
one dinner I get. One dinner is a man on the rebound with a severe lapse of judgment.
all right, that's enough.
she happens to be a misunderstood woman.
dad, she is an evil bitch.
her daughter was picking out paint chips for her new room.
which is your study by the way.
summer, I am taking Veronica to the launch party at the Cohens' tonight, and I expect you to at least be polite to her.
fine.
Gus, I'm sorry. My mom said I can't open the door for you again.
even if you actually have candy.
it's Johnny.
Oh.
Hi.
Hey, um, is Marissa here?
how come nobody ever comes knocking on this door looking for me?
sorry, I just...
I said some stuff to her yesterday. I wanted to apologize.
I'm afraid she's not here.
Oh, okay.
but... my mom's having this launch party tonight for her new company.
it's at the Cohens'.
she'll be there.
maybe you should stop by.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
come on, I'm inviting you.
so at least there's one person there that's not totally lame.
maybe I'll stop by.
to apologize to Marissa.
so, tell me.
is it that obvious?
well, I mean, you barely touched your short stack.
I can tell when something's up.
it's Kaitlin.
there's this guy looking for her.
says she stole money from his brother.
she stole from another kid? No way.
she admitted it.
but she says she took it because the brother got her friend pregnant and she needed it.
I can't believe it.
well, I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
why would he come after her if her story is true?
so you think she's lying?
I don't know. I think you need to talk to her.
and accuse her of being a thief?
I mean, after everything we put her through, that' ll really build her trust.
well, I don't think the guy's going away without his money.
all right, well, I'll talk to her after the party.
till then we'll just have to keep an eye on her.
uh, check the propane. Thank you.
how's it going?
great.
I've done maybe 12, and I've got about a hundred to go.
make that 102.
I've added Neil Roberts and Veronica Townsend to the guest list.
you've got to be kidding me.
did Sandy... - What?
tell me they were dating? No.
I had to find that out myself last night at the Yacht Club.
it's just...
what is it?
well, for the past few weeks Neil and I have gotten quite close.
and sure, the man is a real catch.
a wealthy doctor, estate with pool and tennis court, but I was just grateful that he's been so kind to Marissa and then last night I saw him with Veronica and it hit me.
I think I have feelings for him.
romantic feelings.
now he's with that witch who tried to harpoon Marissa and they're coming to our launch party.
I'll be okay, Kiki.
I'm like the Gulf region.
at this point, what's one more hurricane?
I'm telling you it'd work.
we're not starting a rumor that my dad has genital warts.
Hey, Seth, how about lending your mom a hand downstairs?
actually, uh, Dad, we're kind of busy right now.
we're trying to figure out a way how to break up my dad and some skanked-out ho bag.
see, everyone knows.
you've got nothing to worry about. It's a long story, but last night's date, one-time thing.
really, because, I mean, he's bringing her to the party tonight.
he's going on a second date with her?
Oh, Sandy, there you are.
I have to talk to you about Veronica Townsend and you-know-who.
now we have a quorum.
what happened?
there are factors of which I was not aware when I had you set them up.
wait, you set them up?
Veronica wanted to go on a date with Summer's dad.
and she threatened to make Marissa's life hell if we didn't set them up.
Neil agreed as a favor.
look, Neil's a smart guy. If he wants to go on a second date with her, maybe he sees something in her that we don't.
huh?
what the hockey?
no, no, no.
okay, okay, fine.
but we have to make sure that she's the one who ends it.
if Neil starts pulling away, she might take it out on Marissa.
genital warts is the answer.
you've got a dinner to set up.
you two keep working on a plan, I'll keep thinking.
we can do this.
okay, we got to make Veronica Townsend not want to date your dad, so tell me the most shameful thing you know about your father.
I'm just not sure which is harder to believe:
that she stole the money or that she paid for some other girl's abortion.
either way, that girl is not my sister.
I'll get it.
Hey, you brought friends.
is this the guy who knows where she is?
Hey, look, no one's getting anything. Get out of here.
I'm not going anywhere.
and which are you-- the stalker or his brother who got a 14-year-old girl pregnant?
what the hell is she talking about?
has anyone seen the cocktail napkins?
give me my money back, bitch!
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Kaitlin!
Kaitlin, Kaitlin. Go to the pool house.
get out of here or we're going to call the cops.
look, I've been trying to do Kaitlin a favor.
she won't help herself. If you want to call the cops, go ahead.
I'll call them myself.
no, no, no, no. It's fine. Marissa, just go talk to her, please.
maybe we can settle this. Give them a second, all right?
Kaitlin, these guys are...
looks like she already planned her getaway.
going somewhere?
like anyone would notice.
Oh, I think those boys you stole the money from would.
I told you not to tell her.
I knew she was going to act like a self-righteous princess.
you're blaming me?
Hey!
why don't you two just talk to each other?
you should just let me help you.
now, I'm supposed to believe that you care?
I do care.
Yeah, that's why I spent the last two Christmases with complete strangers.
strangers who don't even have a nice tree.
and I want to make that up to you.
but you have to start being more honest.
I have to start being honest?
look around, Marissa.
you and Mom have been living a giant lie.
Hey, I just found out about the trailer.
mom said she was renovating a condo.
and you believed her?
my friend Hadley's dad owns this property.
when he heard about his new tenant, he called me right away 'cause he couldn't believe it.
Julie Cooper Nichol? Isn't that Kaitlin's mom?
why would she be living in a trailer park?
I can't believe you knew.
my whole school knew.
so, why did you steal the money?
because I wanted to come back home.
what, to find out if the rumors were true?
no, to make sure that you and Mom were okay.
I'm sorry...
but we really were just trying to spare you.
from what, being a part of this family?
come here.
look, if you stick around long enough, you might find out what that's really like.
I only wanted enough for the car to get here.
I'm sorry for all the lies.
I'll tell the cabbie he's not needed.
well... I guess, unfortunately, you have to go to Mom's launch party.
only if I can borrow something to wear.
where is she?
don't worry, Taylor will be here.
I can't believe I told you that about my Dad.
it does kind of make me see him in a new light.
uh, hi, everybody. Welcome.
thanks for coming.
I'm Kirsten Cohen.
and I'm Julie Cooper Nichol.
thank you.
uh, well, tonight, we launch Newport's first exclusive dating service, New Match, because, well, whether you're gay, straight, single, divorced, nearly divorced, in a world of wealth and luxury, the only thing really worth pursuing is a soul mate.
so drink up, enjoy and flirt.
if I didn't already have the perfect woman, I would sign right up.
will you two excuse me?
don't worry.
the plan is in motion.
Taylor, you're here. Great.
Oh, it's good to see you, too, Seth.
Yeah, so...
now, don't make a pass at me. I don't want you coming between sisters.
okay. Come here.
listen, uh, how serious is your mom about Dr. Roberts?
well, let's put it this way. When my mom decides she wants something, she gets it.
like when she wanted my dad, she got him.
and when she wanted all of his money and the house in the divorce, she got that.
and now she wants Dr. Neil Roberts.
well, there's just something I think you should know about him.
here it is-- most of it, anyway.
Thanks.
so, uh, where's Kaitlin?
uh, with her sister. Why?
why do I get the feeling this isn't just about the money?
just thought Kaitlin might come by with you.
to apologize or something.
the least she could do is apologize.
so she didn't say anything to you about me at all?
like...?
I don't know.
you're in love with her.
maybe I thought I was, but...
but what?
just be careful of that girl, man.
she's amazing.
Thanks.
you know, I used to always lie awake, so jealous that you, Mom and Dad were at one of these things.
a Newport party.
Yeah, well, you're finally here.
Yeah.
well, what I had in mind was way cooler than this.
well, how' d it go?
watch and see.
Neil, maybe we should go somewhere a little bit more private and have a drink.
that sounds like a good idea.
Hi, um, I'm sorry. Mom, could I just talk to you for a second?
um, Taylor, Dr. Roberts and I are trying to have a private conversation.
this is just gonna take a second, though.
it's okay. Go ahead.
what?
who told you that?
is everything okay?
uh, yeah. Uh, Neil, uh, we'll have to do that drink another time.
uh, Taylor's not feeling well. Uh, I'll just talk to you later.
huh? - My God, that is amazing.
all you did was tell her he voted for John Kerry?
Yes, that is exactly what I said.
you told her he had genital warts?!
that Kerry thing wasn't going to work! - Come on!
Neil! - Hey, Sandy.
you're all alone.
Yes, yes. Veronica's daughter wasn't feeling well.
you're probably right.
I think I've been out of the dating pool so long, I was momentarily polite.
well, I think it's time for me to be getting home.
I think there's someone here who wouldn't mind your company.
Hey, Kaitlin.
you leaving?
I wish I could.
party that good, huh?
just got a little bit more interesting.
I'm going to find Marissa. Excuse me.
Hey, there.
Where's Veronica?
she left.
alone?
Really?
you two seemed to be getting along so well.
actually, I was hoping that you might have dinner with me sometime.
Neil, I would love to.
Oh, sorry.
I walked into that.
no, um, what are you doing here?
I'm not staying; I just, um...
I wanted to apologize for yesterday.
I don't know why I said those things when they're not even true.
I guess I just, um...I missed you.
apology accepted.
I missed you, too.
look, I know we both have our own lives now; just... don't be a stranger, okay?
and speaking of strangers, have you seen my sister?
Yeah, she's out front.
seemed a little bored.
Yeah. You think maybe you could drive her home?
sure.
um... I'll take her for ice cream or something.
of course I didn't mean to hit you.
I know; I just find it interesting how your hand collided with my face.
Taylor, I thought you left.
Oh, I did. I told my Mom I had to come back.
listen, I am so bummed that it didn't work out between our parents, but...
if you don't mind, I would still really like to think of you as my sister.
Yeah, me, too.
Really?
Oh! Okay, that's great.
that makes this all worthwhile.
okay, so, I got to go, but, um, I'll see you tomorrow in school, sis.
okay.
okay. Bye. - Bye.
what, you want another black eye?
Hey. - Hey.
How' d it go?
good, I guess.
well, was he okay about the money?
I don't think it was the money he was after.
they were seeing each other.
what? You're kidding.
he's, like, our age.
and she lied about hers.
well, it's not that big of a surprise, I guess.
I kind of feel sorry for the guy.
I mean, you were what, a year older than Kaitlin when I met you?
I know what it's like to fall for a Cooper girl.
Yeah, I guess you do.
where is she now?
Oh, well, Johnny took her home, so hopefully, by now, she's safe in bed.
thanks for getting me out of there.
no problem.
you know how people say that you can't go home again?
I'm never sure if that means that the place has changed or you have.
well, what do you think?
I think this place is exactly the same as I left it.
and you?
pull over.
no, we're gonna stop... - I don't want ice cream.
just stop the car.
I feel like a swim.
now? - Yeah.
so you scared? - No, but...
come on!
last one in!
Kaitlin, wait!
come on!
do you think that Marissa would mind if I invited Johnny?
she seemed a little weird when she saw us together last night.
but they're just friends, so why would it matter?
I love Ryan.
it doesn't mean that you don't like Johnny. - I don't.
then you wouldn't mind that I just made out with him upstairs.
we both have very complex lives, and...
maybe we should consider all of the implications before going further.
are we building a hospital?
is it too late for a new approach? - Let's do it your way.
you're trying to take care of me.
the least I can do is take care of you.
Caleb would've been proud.
we got it.
sandy, that's wonderful.
and you did it your way.
Yeah.
Cohen! I got one!
got an interview with the Brown guy.
Mrs. Rothschild just told me, and that you got one, too.
please tell me it went okay.
it went great.
totally bonded.
are you high?
am I high?
come on, wake up.
Hey.
what's wrong? - Seth is gone.
what? He's gone?
Yeah. His alarm went off,
I went into his room, his bed his empty.
uh... calc exam.
calc exam?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, he probably just went in early to school to cram for it.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna drive over there to make sure.
no, no. I'll go. I'll go.
I gotta get to school early anyway.
if there was anything going on with, Seth, anything I should know, you would tell me, right?
Yeah.
I'll call you, uh, when I find him.
Hey, man.
so, uh, Sandy noticed you're done- he's worried.
just taking in the sunrise, Ryan.
Yeah, that's what they have windows for.
so I wanted to be alone- are you the only one in this family that's allowed to brood?
man, whatever it is, you can tell me.
my Brown interview did not go... so well.
actually, it didn't go at all.
you blew it off?
Yep.
and then to put the cherry on top of that,
I went ahead and lied to Summer about it.
right.
well... I don't know, talk to her.
Yeah, see, Summer was over pot by the tenth grade.
she thinks it's totally juvenile
it'd be like telling her I'm into Beanie Babies.
well, you know, at least tell her that you missed the interview.
you do that, and I'll keep quiet about the rest of it.
we're getting dangerously close to an after-school special here, Ryan.
it's marijuana, and I did it twice.
so you're telling me you didn't come down here to buy a bag?
fine, I wasn't gonna smoke anymore anyways.
the O. C.
the Cliffhanger
what are you doing?
trying to decide on a bathing suit.
do you think tankinis are over?
you're going swimming? - No.
Johnny's taking me for a surf lesson.
he says the waves always best in the morning.
that's what I hear.
look... I know that you're mad about me and Johnny.
I'm not mad. Do I look mad?
okay, we may not be BFFs, but you're my sister, and I can tell when you're mad.
Kaitlin, look in my eyes.
I don't care about you and Johnny.
you have a boyfriend.
so Johnny Harbor's fair game, right?
I'm not talking about this.
can you honestly tell me you have no feelings for him?
that's what I thought.
Hey.
you're right on time.
sorry, I didn't mean to walk in on anything.
no problem.
you ready to surf?
uh, I got to go.
enjoy the beach.
katy Rubell, 39, single.
loves tennis, loves working out.
do we have anyone for her?
I say she dies alone.
I'm sorry,
I just can't focus on fixing other people's love lives when my own is such a mess.
Dr. Roberts will call you.
or if you want, you could call him.
I know you've been married for, like, 200 years, but you must remember something about dating.
well, I hope so, or I'm in the wrong business.
maybe that's the answer.
pitch Dr. Roberts the dating service, set him up.
set him up? Are you high?
no, I'm serious. Then you'll be back on his radar and it won't seem like you're pursuing him.
I like it.
I'm aloof but thoughtful.
and when he's confronted with the idea of dating these Newpsies...
half of whom he's Botox'd himself.
...he will realize that the only woman he wants is you.
and he will call you for dinner.
I'll suggest Al Fiorno's, a table by the window.
I'm impressed.
you're sneakier than I thought, Kirsten Cohen.
well, being around you all these years, it's rubbed off.
Hey.
Hey, Cohen.
Hey, did you write your thank you note yet to the Brown interviewer?
no. Actually, that's something I wanted to talk to u about.
Oh, you came to the right person, because I am master of the thank you note.
Oh. Listen to this.
thank you so much for the resplendent interview.
resplendent. Yeah.
I bought a thesaurus.
Shelly loves SAT words.
I didn't know you two were on a first-name basis.
Oh, yeah, we totally power-bonded.
which means I may actually have a chance of getting into Brown.
do you know what that means?
no calling, no texting, no e-mailing
just us together, isn't that great?
Yeah. Okay, so tell me
how did your interview really go?
do you think you aced it?
I knocked it out of the park. - Really?!
Yeah. Yeah. And it wasn't easy, believe me, but, you know,
I turned on the Cohen charm, as usual, and... the lady swooned.
Cohen? - Yeah?
Shelly's a guy.
is it because... yes, yes, you're... I'm sor... correct.
but with the feminine energy, I don't know,
I got a gay vibe, I'm gender-blind, that's the thing, and that's something that I'm gonna have to work on at Brown next year when we go together.
okay, I'm gonna see you later.
I got to go. Cohen.
we'll talk after school.
Hey. Wow, somebody was really craving caffeine. - Oh, yeah.
I can barely keep my eyes open.
early morning wake-up call, courtesy of Seth.
Oh, has he told Summer yet? - No, and he's not going to.
by the way, I promised that, um, we'd keep quiet about it, as long as he told her about the interview.
Oh, I was looking forward to Summer bitch-slapping Kaitlin for giving Seth pot.
guess she's just gonna get away with it, like always.
you know, it's for the best.
I mean, she screwed up, but she's still pretty much a kid.
Yeah.
but with my mom's DNA.
which means she's capable of more than you think.
um... are we still talking about Seth, or...
this is just sister stuff.
you know, I should probably get to class.
see you later.
okay.
it's 'just sister stuff'?
okay, let's practice your pop-up one more time.
when you told me you were gonna give me a surfing lesson,
I kind of imagined us in the water.
no, no. First lesson's always on the sand.
as long as we're skipping the water part, why don't we just do this back at your place?
or we could just blow the whole thing off.
rent a movie, order in pancakes.
I thought you said you wanted to learn how to surf.
I'm not training for the Olympics, okay?
sorry. I'm just distracted.
thinking about Marissa.
story of my life.
I like a guy, he's in love with my older sister...
look, Marissa and I have a history together, all right?
it's... just complicated.
uncomplicate it.
do something.
I can't do anything.
it's not place.
if you're too lame to do something,
I'll just find somebody who will.
I thought this was a done deal.
Miriam already gave us the hospital contract.
he did. And now he has to present it to the Board of Physicians.
can't have a hospital without doctors.
like or not, they got a say.
right. Now we have to ply more people with women and liquor.
I don't think that's gonna work.
these guys are doctors, not businessmen.
then we got that in common.
call it willful naive, call it bleary-eyed optimism
you think we've got a shot. - Yeah.
there's over 100, 000 uninsured that live in Orange County.
there's got to be some angle we can find to make that land on these guys.
well, there is.
the head of the board, Henry Griffin.
turns out we have a... a personal connection.
well, now, there's a shocking turn of events.
it's his daughter, Maya.
she's a stripper, too?
no, she was a year ahead of me at Kellogg.
now she's one of its most trusted advisers.
and she used to have a thing for me.
well, who could blame her?
so now you want to dine her, use her affection for you to manipulate her father.
listen, it's no worse than the strippers we got for Bill Miriam.
Oh, I don't know- I draw the line at family, Matt.
how about this?
how about we find a strategy that doesn't involve liquor or sexual favors?
thank you.
I mean, gracias.
Julie? - Hi.
uh, your receptionist told me you'd be home today, so I thought I'd come by and personally thank you for hosting Kaitlin's birthday party.
and as a token of my appreciation...
bachelorettes of Newport?
you want to set me up?
well, unless... you don't want to be set up.
well, I hadn't really thought about it.
because I can totally understand if a blind date seems like too much.
let's see what you have there.
wow, she's pretty.
mm, pear shaped.
but pretty.
look at her, nice... smile.
Yeah. Adult braces.
and her...
Julie, all of these women look fantastic.
it's going to take me a while to choose one.
do you mind if I get back to you?
finally, you're home.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were waiting for me.
well, I just get kind of lonely while you guys are all at school.
speaking of school, shouldn't you be going back to yours soon?
how many times do I have to tell you guys?
it's called mid-winter break.
it's long.
apparently.
look, want to talk to you about Marissa.
this whole Johnny triangle we're all trapped in.
triangle?
well, now that I'm here, it's more like a square.
well, anyway, see, I like him.
and I'm not getting anywhere because he thinks he's got a chance with Marissa.
well, not that that's any of your business, but it's not the case.
I don't know.
see, today I asked her if she had feelings for him point blank.
she didn't deny it.
well, thanks for the heads up.
I think Marissa and I can handle it ourselves.
so if you just want to...
Ryan, I want you to do something about it.
I mean, you're a man of action.
you throw punches at fires.
at least that's the guy I remember from two years ago.
we've all grown up since then.
so you're reformed now?
Congratulations.
doesn't mean you still can't talk to her.
so you can hook up with Johnny?
you get something out of it, too.
you get to find out where you stand...
once and for all.
Ryan, hey.
is everything okay?
cause you sounded really weird on the phone.
I need to know how you feel about Johnny.
so I take it Kaitlin paid you a visit.
this isn't about Kaitlin.
we both knew this was an issue long before she showed up.
I'm with you.
but that's not the whole story, is it?
maybe you just feel sorry for him or...
maybe sometimes you didn't think you can talk to me...
or I wasn't listening...
or maybe you're in love with him.
either way, you got to figure it out.
until then, I... I don't want to see you.
look, I know things have been confusing...
Hey. Morning.
Oh, no, the Atwood grunt.
that's never a good sign.
what's the matter?
I'm going to guess Marissa or Johnny.
maybe Kaitlin.
I'm going to say probably a combo platter.
I think Marissa and I are on thin ice.
she needs to figure out her relationship with Johnny pronto.
she's, uh, got good taste in people
I'm sure she'll do the right thing.
speaking of the right thing...
um... I tried to talk to Summer.
And? - I chickened out.
which is kind of my go-to move these days.
but I'm going to take care of it.
and I'm rescheduling the interview.
think they're going to let you take it again after you blew the first one off?
well, for the first one I had an epileptic fit.
and there was a three-car pileup on the freeway with a jackknifed trailer truck, so...
all right, I'll work on my excuse.
that's a good idea.
Oh, Kaitlin, you're up.
I was just making some grits.
okay. Mom, we get it.
we live in a trailer park.
there's no need to go overboard.
Marissa, you want some?
I'm not hungry.
fine.
I'll go see if Gus likes these.
I mean, he does eat pigeons after all.
be right back.
I'd kill for some Apple Jacks.
do you think we have any?
Kaitlin, you had no right to talk to Ryan about my relationship with Johnny.
it's none of your business.
I was just sharing my opinion.
what did I ever do to you?
I mean, I know Mom ignores you and Dad left.
okay, let's not turn this into family therapy.
okay, then let's not pretend this is all about Johnny.
what else would this be about?
come on, you're doing this to punish me.
you know, I was actually happy when you came home.
I thought we were gonna be friends again.
but now I just can't wait for you to leave.
I just got off the phone with Mr. Spivey from Brown.
looks like you've got a fan.
Oh, great.
you know, I was actually just curious.
did he mention how I went with Seth?
Seth Cohen? - Yeah.
you know, gangly, mop-head, barely has an ass.
right. Um...
unfortunately, Seth missed his interview.
what? - He was a no-show.
he was just in here explaining the situation.
something about a tractor-trailer accident.
Oh, my God, that little bitch.
excuse me?
I'm sorry.
thank you for your help.
well...
I finally heard from Dr. Roberts.
that's great.
or not.
he had me set him up with Laura Cross.
they'll be eating at Il Forno's, a table by the window.
Oh, Julie, I'm sorry.
Oh, no, it's my own fault.
I let you do the scheming, clearly not your wheel hour.
from now on, if someone needs to be manipulated, we put me in charge. Fair enough.
I don't know her.
well, she'll probably marry him and enjoy a life of free brow lifts.
anyway...
I am going to get to know her and find out what I'm up against.
don't tell me you're going to spy on them.
I tried taking your advice, Kiki, and quite frankly, it sucked.
from now on, we do things the Julie Cooper way.
Julie Cooper, be careful.
I see we have a problem.
chili, man, I'm fine, all right, I just...
in love with Marissa Cooper.
my friend, in all my years of loving ladies and getting nothing in return
I have never been as bad off as you.
Thanks, man. Makes me feel a lot better.
normally...
I would advise you to go cold turkey.
delete her number from your cell, spam-block her e-mails, and just he that the obsession passes.
but I see that you are in deeper than this.
so what do I do?
you take a shot.
that way, even if she rejects you, at least you know you tried.
Yeah, and there's always a chance that she feels the same way, right?
reasons abound.
the point is, you owe it to yourself to at least know whether or not she likes you.
you could have a drink tonight.
you sure?
well, you've had a tough day.
so has Matt.
looks like he's come here to drown his sorrows.
Oh. Well, you should ask him to join us if he's all by himself.
or not.
Ah, that's Maya Griin.
O. C. Weekly just did a profile on her.
apparently she's an up-and-coming Newpsie.
wow, I have too much time on my hands.
well, if she's the new queen, she's still got a lot to learn.
well, why wouldn't she date him?
he's young and attractive.
he's using her.
her father's the head of the board.
are you going to talk to him?
tomorrow.
tonight, I'm out with my lovely, beautiful, morally uncompromised wife.
we could go to the Crab Shack, pick up something to go.
sand dabs are in season.
genius.
thanks for meeting me.
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you, too.
things have been...
really weird between us.
Yeah. I know. Um...
that's just why I wanted to get everything out in the open.
Johnny, I don't know if now's the time to...
I love you...
and I think you love me, too. - Johnny...
look, okay, look what's happened between us.
I mean, I got hurt and you took care of me even when I begged you not to. - I know.
that's true. But...
I told you to stay away from me and you showed up at my house.
I'm not imagining this, okay?
there's something real between us.
that's why neither of us can walk away.
look...
you don't have to say anything right now, okay
just, you know, think about it.
morning.
morning. - Hi, Ryan.
feel like a bagel? - I do, thank you.
Ah, there's my son.
how are you?
do we have poppy? Oh, great.
how are you really?
uh... I'm really fine, Dad.
how are you?
I'm good. I'm good.
just making sure you're staying afloat.
I know you got a lot of stress.
exams, college applications.
Yeah, no, not to worry.
it's all under control.
Oh, hey, Summer.
Hi.
just in time for breakfast.
Oh, thanks, Mr. C.
actually, I was wondering if I could talk to Seth upstairs...
um, possibly alone.
okay.
all right, so...
Ow! What the hell?
you lied about your college interview, and I don't like liars!
I can explain.
explain what, that you're pathological?
that you invent stories about college interviews that never even happened?
you make it sounds so bad.
cohen, you are in a deceit spiral, and if you don't stop now, you could turn into one of those creepy old men who have secret attics where they hide stolen money and porn.
okay, first of all, that sounds awesome.
second of all, could be worse.
I got scared.
scared?
Yeah.
tongue-tied, uh, dizzy.
my bladder felt weak.
I just want to know why you didn't tell me.
because I was embarrassed.
you've got this natural confidence.
you're small and you're cute.
people like you.
I'm a social outcast with a mumbling problem.
you're just realizing this now?
well, if we go to college together, everybody's going to love you, and I'm going to be your nerdy boyfriend.
and I'm going to be your not-so-bright girlfriend that can't keep up when everyone's talking about Yakuza films and Prowst.
it's Proust.
see?
look, we have to be honest with each other, or this is never going to work.
no, you're right.
so is there anything else you need to tell me?
cause now's your chance.
just put it out on the table.
no.
okay.
then you are officially exonerated.
thesaurus again.
you want to get down?
Hey.
I don't know we were working this weekend.
I thought maybe you and I would go hit the links.
what, and ruin a sport I love?
it's the weekend, so I'm going to make this brief as I know how.
I was at dinner last night with Kirsten at the Yacht Club.
I saw you there... with Maya.
Henry Griffin told Maya out meeting with me, so she decided to get in touch.
she asked you to dinner.
she did.
Why? Is it illegal to take a girl out to dinner?
you know, when Kirsten used to run this place,
I saw a lot of creeps in nice suits that used to try to use her to get to her there.
I didn't like it then, and I don't like it now.
we're trying to build a hospital that could service 100, 000 uninsured.
you're trying to use a daughter to manipulate her father...
and you're comfortable with that.
look, Sandy, you're a great guy, but maybe you don't have the stomach for this.
all I'm saying is that we're going to have to bend the rules if we want to win the game.
that'd look great on a bumper sticker.
I want to see you on Monday with a real game plan.
all right.
Hey.
um... Kirsten let me in.
she seems really nice. What do you want?
look, um... you've always been a really good guy to me.
you know, you've helped me with Volchek, trusted me with Marissa...
now you're in love with her.
I told her.
I- I promised myself I- I would just live with these feelings, you know
I wouldn't do anything about them, but, um...
I just can't do that anymore.
what, do you want my blessing?
I guess I just...
just wanted to say I'm sorry.
thanks for that.
leave now.
well, I'm passionately devoted to my work on the board of the Children's Museum.
children are so important, don't you think?
Oh, she's so phony.
well, of course she is. She lives in Newport.
Oh, God, mayday.
Taryn Baker just walked in.
well, you'd better get out of there before she sees you.
dinner with you, apparently.
Oh, too late.
Hi, Taryn.
why are you all bundled up like that?
has Newport been taken over by the Taliban?
I'd really love to stay and chat, but I have to be going...
Oh, my goodness, it's Laura Cross!
Laura, hi!
it's me, Taryn, from Orchid Club.
Oh, Taryn, of course.
do you know Julie?
I have to go. We haven't met.
Oh, my! What a coincidence.
have you been sitting at the next table this whole time?
are you spying on me?
uh... I...
I'm sorry.
Hey.
there's a sale at Paul Frank if you want to go.
probably can't afford anything, but we could try stuff on.
no thanks.
I'm guessing you're still mad at me.
look, I know you may not believe me when I say this, but I'm trying to do you a favor.
Oh, ah? Well, thanks.
so far, it's been a real blast.
remember when we were little, and Dad used to always take us to Baskin-Robbins?
you'd have to sample, like, every single flavor before you could decide on what you actually wanted, and en once you did, you realized that you didn't like it, so you'd cry.
dad would have to take you back in to get another cone.
is this another story about how growing up, it was always about me? - No.
it's about you not trusting your instincts.
maybe I'm not built that way.
so? It's a skill. Learn it.
make a decision and stick with it.
remember what I used to always get?
gold Medal Ribbon.
every time.
I figured I loved it why question it?
honey, you just missed Missa.
Marissa? - Yeah.
she left this for you.
I'm sorry.
you want to be with Johnny.
no, I'm sorry I ever made you wonder.
look, you two have a connection.
I get that. It's not even about him.
no, it's... it's about me.
I was just... not being able to talk to you about Trey.
and then with Kaitlin coming back, her hook up with Johnny, it just...
it threw me for loop.
but I think we can get past that. It's not that easy.
you can't just snap your fingers and make everything go back the way it was before.
well, we can try.
maybe start with dinner?
which Cooper are you here to see?
I'm here to see you.
I thought maybe we could go to the beach.
for a night surfing lesson?
I was thinking more like bonfire and tequila.
even better.
know where my mom keeps the stash.
so, what's the occasion?
just feel like you and I never really got a chance to party.
what do you say?
okay.
hungry
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
I... I should've called.
Oh, it's okay.
I figured you were here.
who would've thought the Newport Group would be where I go to for a moment of Zen?
I know.
sometimes this job makes you do a lot of hard thinking.
I want this hospital more than I've wanted anything in a long time.
then you can't let Matt's relationship with Maya Griffin stand in your way.
for all you know, she could be using him, too, or they could live happily ever after.
the point is if you want this as bad as I think you do, you have to go for it.
so where's the line?
I'm not worried about you knowing where the line is.
you always do. It's who you are.
coming!
hang on...
cohen, why is the door locked?
cohen, I brought some DVDs.
save the Last Dance and She's All That.
now, I know you're not interested in either of them, but I cannot watch another movie about Japanese people flying through the air.
okay, that's fine. Let's go downstairs.
wait, what? That's fine, but are you okay?
Yeah, I'm great. Come on.
what's that smell? - It is incense.
I was doing yoga, plus I had some really bad gas.
gross.
God, wish I'd brought something to mix it with.
eh...
couple more sips, you won't even notice.
okay, alkie.
can we just hook up already?
or, before you pass out on me.
you don't waste any time, do you?
well, it's just the fire.
it's so romantic.
well, the fire is, actually, kind of dying.
well, okay then.
I'll just go find some driftwood.
heat things up a bit.
what's that?
nothing I want to remember.
where are you going?
to climb up there.
okay, tequila rock climbing,
I'm not exactly sure that's the best combination.
so don't come.
Johnny, wait.
go away, Gus.
I told you, I don't play strip pinochle.
you play strip pinochle?
long story. What...
what are you doing here?
I stopped by to thank you for fixing me up with Laura.
she's a wonderful woman.
well, good.
I'm glad it worked out with the two of you.
if you'll excuse me, I have a Hot Pocket in the microwave and a wine cooler with my name on it, so good luck.
what? What do you want?
you.
excuse me?
you can be manipulative, you can be aggressive,
I've know you to stretch the truth on occasion.
but the fact is, when I'm not around you, I miss you.
you do?
what can I say?
I've fallen for you.
well... this just may be your lucky night.
I have an extra Hot Pocket.
Johnny, would you just come down already?
you're wasted.
Johnny, just come down.
did you see?
Johnny, just come down.
I almost dropped it.
it's okay, I got it.
Johnny, please!
just come down.
Seth's really into that movie.
Yeah, I know, and he ate all of our dumplings.
look, I know it's gonna take more than Thai food and teen movies to sort this out, but if you want to talk...
talking is the last thing I feel like doing.
I figured, since you gave me the silent treatment the whole way in the car.
what do you want from me?
I want you.
you want to answer that?
not really.
wait.
it's Kaitlin.
Ah, she's setting the mood.
all right, let me just get rid of her.
setting the mood.
tell her that... Wait.
Kaitlin, let me call you back.
Marissa, can you come and get me?
I'm at Westward Cove with Johnny.
no, I'm busy.
you're getting busy.
no, but you don't understand. I'm scared.
he's drunk and he's acting like a crazy person.
Hey, come up here!
you got to see this view!
Johnny, just come down.
what's that?
Marissa, it's him, I'm telling you.
Johnny's in trouble and I don't know what to do.
um, hold on.
she sounds really upset
it's Johnny?
Yeah, he's in trouble.
you have to help me. He won't come down.
he's really in trouble?
I swear. We'll be right there.
Wow.
so that was, um...
that was Save the Last Dance, uh?
no, I thought it was amazing.
that dance number at the end was so inspiring.
and Summer, I'm so glad... I'm so, so glad, that she got into Julliard in the end.
and she did it for her mom.
for her mom, Summer.
Yeah, it wasn't that good.
this is pretty amazing, too.
it's just a blue screen, Cohen.
I know, but it's so blue.
I never realized how blue it was before.
I kind of, like, want to go swimming in it or something.
for a little dippy-dip.
okay, it's pretty blue. - Yeah.
could you excuse me, I got to go to the bathroom.
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
we should, we should take our pants off.
come on, Captain Oats. We both know something's up.
EW.
over there.
you go to Kaitlin.
I'm gonna find another way up there.
keep him talking.
Johnny, just come down!
Kaitlin. Are you all right?
Oh, I'm so happy that you're here.
look, you have to get down from there.
go home!
I don't have anything to say to you.
look, we can get through this, all right?
I mean, you're one of my best friends.
after all we've been through,
I get to be your best friend?
come on, let me explain it to you.
look, just come down, Johnny.
dude, you are the last person I want to see right now.
okay, all right, let's get you down from there.
we can talk about it later, okay?
right, right.
so you can save me one more time for Marissa.
Hey, Marissa!
you want to watch Ryan save me again?!
just come down, Johnny, please!
so she'll love you even more.
okay, just be careful, all right? - What, I might fall, you get to come in and grab me at the last second?
Ryan Atwood saves the...
Hey, If you need anything else, let me know. - Thanks.
I want you to leave Ryan alone.
you must really think I'm gonna hurt him.
I chickened out, which is kind of my go-to move these days, but I'm rescheduling the interview.
it's Maya Griffin.
whose father's the head of the physician's board?
I'm totally cool about turning your apartment into the Playboy grotto.
I'm Jess. - Trey.
I've always had this fantasy about two brothers.
I want you out of Newport.
we could take off together.
where would we go?
marissa and I are broken up.
I'm glad you finally made your decision.
cohen, your Brown interview is, like, in 11 hours.
don't you think you should be prepping for it?
Nope. I've got a new approach to interviews.
it's called "don't think about it."
I guess that's better than your last approach.
Hey, what's all that?
a little half-time buffet
pretzels, Ding Dongs, jar of gefilte fish.
just trying to mix it up.
that's always appreciated.
Ryan, you ready for a rematch?
Oh, do we have to?
I thought I called winners.
no offense, I just don't think you should step into the ring with me.
Yeah, before Ryan and I came,
playstation was pretty much his best friend.
come on. One game, Set
my controller.
Ryan, will you come get drinks with me, please? - Yes.
okay, you ready?
this is my lucky controller.
so, Atwood, seems like you're really moving on.
Yeah, trying to.
well, I promise, no weirdness from me.
I mean, Coop's my best friend, but I've also accepted the fact that you and Marissa...
not really meant to be. - Which is why it's good that you've found the opposite of Marissa.
you really think Sadie is Marissa's opposite?
and game over!
whoa, dude, you got killed already?
I'm humbled, man, I am humbled and mortified.
it's okay, I can't take all the credit.
I found a cheat code on the Internet.
Ryan, this one's a keeper, man
Anti-Coop.
who knew my new PlayStation idol would be you new girlfr...
your new... - like a - Friend.
friend. - girl, friend. - Nice save.
think "friend" is the word.
I'm gonna get that.
nice dodge. - Thanks.
friend" was what I was looking for.
Oh, good, you recognize me.
even with the new look.
Yeah, kind of came with the new life.
listen, I brought you something.
it's a belated birthday present from your brother.
you still keep in touch with him?
Yeah.
I lived with him out in Vegas for a while.
just got back a few months ago.
here.
Thanks.
don't you want to know how he's doing?
Hey.
Ryan, if you want to talk, you know where I live.
who was that?
nobody.
let's just go back inside.
come on, you're up next.
the O. C.
undertow - Hey. - Hey.
you know, I know Trey's not made of money or anything, but he could have at least sprung for a shirt or something.
it's an inside thing. Long story.
I like long stories.
too bad.
I don't feel like telling this one.
breakfast is ready in the kitchen.
Oh, I haven't seen one of those in years.
do you remember when your dad and I used to buy these for you?
couldn't for the life of us get you to play with them.
Where'd you find this, anyway?
a friend of his dropped it off.
you remember Jess?
charming girl who took too much X and floated face down in a pool?
Yeah, she moved to Vegas with Trey, and they lived together.
well, how is he? Is he okay?
I don't know.
figured he's out of my life.
why get back into it?
well, breakfast is ready.
what are you doing?
thought you'd be at school.
so you were just gonna lurk around my house while I wasn't home?
came to drop something off.
I thought you were gonna sell this.
this watch was really expensive.
no, I, uh, I decided to hang on to it.
and now you're giving it back?
well, there's a surprise twist.
Thanks.
anything else?
look, I just want to be alone right now.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, you look busy.
listen, I'm gonna be at the beach tonight.
maybe I'll see you.
don't count on it.
no, you're the man, sir.
okay, I'll see you soon.
so?
turns out the guy is a huge anime fan.
we got into the whole Akira vs. Ghost in the Shell debate.
both came down on Ghost in the Shell.
I have no idea what you're saying, but I'm so happy for you.
I'm going to go call my parents, tell them to start packing my bags.
congratulations, baby!
Oh, holy Kodak moment.
Oh, I guess Seth just aced his Brown interview.
that's fantastic!
we're so gonna party tonight.
I'll make a flan.
Oh, you know what, Taylor, actually,
Seth and I were thinking about hanging out alone.
my dad's out of town, we have the house to ourselves.
Oh. Say no more.
hmm. - What?
Taylor? - Hmm?
what's wrong with your eye?
it's a knowing wink, Summer.
you and Seth, the house all to yourselves.
who knows what could happen?
me. There'll be leftover Thai and the Blade trilogy.
Oh, oh, I didn't realize that you and Seth had lost the magic.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
you must be panicking.
um, okay, I didn't come to you.
and why would I panic?
well, it looks like you two are going to college together.
don't you worry that Seth's eye will wander?
all the nubile young coeds?
you, the familiar old shoe?
um, I'll have you know, Taylor, that I am, like, five levels hotter than him.
summer, the libido does not listen to logic.
at this age, men are driven by a reptilian force.
spread the seed. Spread the seed.
spread the... - Taylor.
if Seth and I go to college together, we will be just fine.
and I'll have you know, we have a very healthy sex life.
then super.
you have fun tonight.
but, Summer, if you ever need to girl talk...
Bye, Taylor.
Hey.
glad you're home.
Yeah, just walked in.
I didn't know you were stopping by.
you're still into toy cars?
I choose to find that cute instead of creepy.
it's just something someone gave me.
at your doorstep yesterday?
Jess is just a friend of my brother's.
I'd tell you the whole story, but...
but you'd just rather not?
that's cool.
but just know if you do decide to tell me, I will listen.
and without judgment.
or you can keep it all to yourself.
both a fine with me.
okay.
I'm going to get going.
Dr. Henry Griffn.
what a surprise.
I hope you don't mind.
please, we're building a hospital together.
when all is said and done, we'll be like family.
hang on a sec, let me get Matt in here.
um, I'd rather that you didn't.
board called an impromptu meeting yesterday.
it seems there's been some complaints about your associate.
complaints?
rumors.
parties at his house, booze, gambling, God knows what else.
board's not sure they want to do business with him.
well, I'll talk to him, make sure he cleans up his act.
this is not about a slap on the wrist, Sandy.
we want him off the project.
Matt worked his ass off for this deal.
I couldn't take him off it.
then I'm afraid we can't go forward with the hospital.
you got be kidding me.
take a few days, mull it over.
remember, Sandy, this hospital could change everything for you.
you really want to give it all up for one 26-year-old hotshot?
Hey, man. - Hey.
what's going on tonight, big plans with Sadie?
uh... maybe.
I don't know,
I haven't really decided yet.
yeah? What's Plan B?
I don't know.
I just need to know if Trey's okay.
well, nothing you hear is going to make it easier that he's not a part of your life.
listen.
as we speak, your new, uh, sometimes, kind-of girlfriend is probably sitting by, cradling a hunk of plaster, waiting for you to make a move.
so, you can either dwell in the past and go see Jess, or live for the now, and give Sadie a call.
so, you called.
Hi. - Hey.
come on in.
Thanks.
just in the neighborhood?
Yeah, I was driving by.
okay, no, I wasn't.
the truth is,
summer's with Seth and I'm all alone, and I'm kind of going out of my mind.
well, you know, tomorrow I'm going to go up to L. A. but if you want, feel free to make this your crash pad for the weekend.
that'd be great.
all right. Make yourself at home.
all right, two down, one to go.
you really want to watch the entire Blade trilogy?
you can't leave the last disc unwatched, it'll feel bad.
well, I thought tonight was about celebrating your interview.
it is- hence the trilogy.
you know...
we could forget the movie, go upstairs...
Mmm, you smell so good.
you like the smell of salami?
what? I had a salami sub.
I feel like it's lingering.
uh! You know what? Just forget it.
forget what?
I was trying to create a mood.
I know.
I know that now.
I was just thrown off a little bit by your approach.
nuzzling your ear and complimenting you?
I wasn't exactly reinventing the wheel.
normally you just throw me down and your thing, but I can adjust.
not interested.
you smell good, too.
press play, before I break your face.
fine.
Sadie Hey, it's Sadie, leave a message.
Hey. So, I know you're painting, but it's Friday night.
I'm making you take a break.
I'll be there in 20 minutes, okay?
Bye.
Hey, Ryan.
I was just about to take a swim, come on in.
look, I can't stay long.
but you couldn't resist getting the lowdown on your brother?
guy has a way of sucking you in.
I know.
drink?
just tell me, is he okay?
well, he misses you.
Trey's not the type to cry into his pillow every night, but... I can tell.
you know him that well, huh?
let's just say he's of a certain mold:
angry, damaged, reckless.
it's the kind of guy I go for.
my boyfriend now, Jim, same deal.
we all have our types, don't we?
I tell you what, why don't you stay a while?
look, Jess, we were never friends.
got it
you can go if you want.
do you know Trey's dealing?
blackjack.
off the Strip.
so he's staying out of trouble?
trying to
don't move.
I'm going to get some clothes.
just stay a little while.
I have a lot more to tell you about Trey.
music too loud?
No! It's just the grunting and excessive banging that I'm concerned about.
sorry.
you okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
girl problems?
safe bet, usually, but no.
actually, this is more complicated.
is it that girl, Jessica?
Yeah. My brother.
just trying to prevent another casualty of Trey.
so you're trying to save this girl?
is that something I do?
look, we love Marissa, she's family, and she means a lot to us.
but she's been through so much, and you got pulled into that.
Yeah, well, some of that was my fault.
but you're right, yeah, I can't argue with you.
have we mentioned that we love Sadie?
she's smart and she's ground.
and I am trying- trying- not to screw it up.
just because a girl isn't tied to some train tracks, doesn't mean that she should be ignored.
I know, I know.
it's just, Jess is trying to put Trey behind her - and start a new life. - Great.
as long as she doesn't get in the way of yours.
look, I know it's weird I slept here, but I just didn't feel like being in the trailer by myself.
if you need somewhere to go, you can always come to our house.
I... I know.
you guys are like family.
it's just that these days...
things are difficult with you and Ryan, I get that.
but you don't belong here.
okay. Um, I was just leaving anyway.
if you're looking for Matt, he went to L. A. for a meeting.
well, I'll track him down.
you go home.
okay.
all right.
excuse me? Hi. - Yeah.
I'm picking up an order for Roberts.
sure, just a second.
Thanks.
guess who?
Oh, God. Hi!
looks like someone got the short straw.
what? No, I ordered pancakes.
no, you drew the short straw.
you know, after the sex when every one's hungry, but nobody wants to get the takeout, short straw picks up the food.
Yes!
that is exactly what you're seeing happening here.
total short-straw scenario.
with the hunger, and all the sex we had last night.
Yes.
so was last night like totally kinky, or was it like more about tender lovemaking?
you know, smooth jazz, a burning fire, a zebra-skin rug.
we had a very nice time.
Oh, my God.
you didn't have sex at all, did you?
are my pancakes ready yet?
your lips aren't chapped, there's no love bites on your neck, your voice isn't at all hoarse from screaming.
pancakes, right?
thank you. Good-bye, Taylor. - Summer...
summer, wait, I can help you!
Hey. - Hey.
grab a brush, we're in the homestretch.
so I thought maybe
I was going to see you last night.
I got tied up, sorry.
what, do you work for the CIA?
doesn't matter, I, uh... I got distracted for a few days.
but I'm fine now. In fact
I'm all yours.
okay. Fine. You're forgiven.
but in exchange for your silence,
I demand a dinner.
okay. Tomorrow night?
okay, perfect, yeah.
Hey, it's Summer, leave a message.
so nothing happened.
still, Matt should know better.
but he doesn't.
you have to remember that he's not that much older than the boys.
he just needs some advice from the great Sandy Cohen.
Oh, sometimes you overestimate me.
not possible.
Oh, get a room.
Hey, count your blessings.
kids with affectionate parents grow up to be better adjusted sexually as adults.
I know, I meant get a room.
my room. And do it in front of me.
this Sadie?
it's Jess.
whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down.
I can't...
what do you mean?
no, no, no.
stay put, stay put. I'll be right there.
Hey.
this happen to you again.
after this, I'm done.
if I need help, I'll call, okay?
thanks for coming out.
Yeah, I need to talk about Seth anyway.
so have you talked to him today?
either that, or he's treading water till he gets to Brown, and finds a big pair of pale New England boobs to replace me.
Oh, babe, you just had an off night.
it'll be okay.
did this ever happen with you and Ryan?
actually, no.
I mean, we had our problems, that just wasn't one of them.
what about towards the end, when you guys started drifting apart?
kind of the opposite.
I guess...
...the more emotionally unavailable you are, the more you end up wanting each other.
what are you looking at?
nothing.
Hey, you think maybe we should get out of here?
sold.
did you see him?
not yet. How many times has he come around?
it started a couple hours ago.
he's been calling, too.
and when'd you end it? - Earlier today.
I guess I was inspired by our talk last night, so I called him up, told him I didn't want to see him anymore, and now here I am
down a boyfriend, up a stalker.
is that him in the Mustang?
Yep.
he's coming in.
Yeah. Just go in the back.
look, man, she doesn't want to see you.
who the hell are you, her bodyguard?
no, but I'll kick your ass if you take one step further.
he's gone?
Yeah. I don't think he'll be back.
are you going to be okay?
I'll be fine. I promise.
you sure?
Ryan, I know you don't believe me, but I really am trying to change.
you don't have to stay.
morning.
Hey. Scrambled or fried?
I made both.
neither. I should get going.
coffee would be nice.
don't look all awkward like it's the morning after.
it's not like anything happened last night.
stay, eat.
let me get rid of this.
Hello?
Hi.
of course I do.
I'd have to think about it.
look, I got to go.
I'm sitting here with your brother.
sure. Hang on.
do you want to talk to him?
now's not a good time.
I'll call you later.
he wants me to come back.
what happened to trying to change your life?
I am trying
it's just that it's Trey.
it's hard...
especially all by myself.
well, what about your parents? Where are they?
well, my dad's in Tokyo on business, and my mom's at the spa,
aka in bed with her tennis instructor.
so as you can see, I don't have much to distract me...
unless you want to give it a try.
look, I can't stay here and baby-sit you.
what about your girlfriends at USC?
I guess I could give them a call, see if they want to come down.
call them, invite them down.
just take a breath.
Ryan, I'll try, but... what if I freak out?
you won't.
Matt, call me back.
we've got a lot to discuss.
everything okay?
Oh, it's just business.
Hey.
I heard you aced your Brown interview.
mm, mm.
looks like the stars are aligning for you.
and Summer!
could be another four years together.
Yeah.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
when you were at college with Mom, did it ever... get sort of stale with the monogamy and the constant being together?
your mother was a firecracker.
okay. - My buddies used to say if you see that mail truck rocking, don't come a knocking.
so sorry I asked.
good morning, honey.
Hi, honey.
have either of you guys seen Ryan?
I just checked the pool house, and it looks like he didn't sleep there last night.
good morning, everyone.
Sadie, hello! - Hi, Sadie.
I brought bagels.
hope you don't mind me crashing your breakfast.
Oh, not at all; let me get you some coffee.
Hey, is Ryan around?
actually...
you've really got to learn to lie better.
we'll just let you two...
you're a terrible liar, my dear.
so let me guess.
Ryan got some 911 call from that Jess girl, and it required him spending the night.
that has not been confirmed.
you don't have to protect him, Seth.
it's fine, honestly.
I'm not jealous.
I'm just not really sure that Ryan and I are right for each other.
because?
because he just seems to have a lot of really intense issues.
Yeah, well, intense issues seem to follow Ryan around.
well, I don't really know if I'm up for that right now.
well, listen, I think Ryan really likes you, and think if you hang in there, you two will eventually settle into a, uh, super laid-back, boring-ass relationship, but you've got to cut the guy some slack, and the one time that he tried to date someone normal, my dead grandfather's illegitimate daughter, so you know how that goes
right, yeah, of course.
of course I know how that goes.
do you think you could do me a favor and not tell Ryan that we talked?
I assume you know how to keep a secret.
nobody's home!
don't worry, it's just me.
Oh. Hi.
so, listen, I hate to pop in like this, but I am meeting with Ashley and Madison at school later today to brainstorm for a prom theme.
do you want to come?
uh, you... you probably don't need me for that.
summer, are you kidding me?
it's the end of the year. We are all fried.
come on, please?
fine.
here you go.
do you have to print on a flier for everything?
you'll thank me when you make your 2006 scrapbook.
I mean, there was the party with Bill Meriam, the-the few dates I went on with Maya
nothing that the board could oust me for.
what about Marissa?
what about Marissa?
I went to your house yesterday to talk to you, and she answered the door in pajamas.
she's going through a tough time.
she needed a friend.
well, then be a friend, but for God's sake, Matt, do not be throwing pajama parties with 17-year-old girls.
nothing happened.
that doesn't matter.
and right now, the board is watching you, waiting for you to screw up, and you're screwing up.
this is a witch hunt.
if they want to take me down, they will, unless you stop them.
so please...
call Griffin, tell him you're going to keep me on the project.
EW. School on a Sunday is, like, beyond creepy.
summer, you're right on time.
Where's, um, Ashley and Madison?
you know, you said the AV club was meeting.
I brought A History of Violence.
this is a total ambush.
look, you two are like my family, and if I sense there's trouble with my Sethimer,
I am going to do what I can to help.
we're not in any trouble
at least that we've acknowledged to each other.
that is exactly why I brought you here today:
communication...
intimacy.
these are two skills that you two could improve upon.
now, I am not a licensed sex therapist, but my father was, and before he ran away, he used to conduct these sessions with real couples in our basement.
that's creepy.
okay. We're going to start off with touching.
I want you to place your hands anywhere on each other's bodies, excluding breasts and genitals.
I have to go.
Cohen... put your hands on me now.
come on, it'll be fun.
good. Summer?
good.
okay, now I want you to concentrate on your eye contact.
get lost in each other's gaze.
Mm... getting lost...
I'm getting lost...
as you gaze into each other's eyes, do you feel stirrings... deep in your loins?
I don't really feel anything.
I got nothing. Not really.
not even the faintest spark?
a tiny flicker?
what does that say about us?
well, I also do breakup counseling.
and for you?
I'll have the same, thank you. - Thank you.
so, I'm sorry that I didn't take you anyplace nicer for our first date.
are you kidding?
this place is the culinary destination of Newport.
wait till you try the pancakes.
next time. - Next time?
it's a plan.
Yeah, all right.
excuse me.
is this Ryan Atwood?
who's this?
Kim. I'm Jess' friend.
look, we really need you to come over here.
Wh-Wh-What's going on in the background?
well, word got out about Jess' tonight, and now half of USC is here.
and supposedly Jim is on his way over here and on a rampage.
all right, well, grab Jess and get out of there.
I would, but she's locked in the pool house.
she's drunk, and she's crying, and she says the only person she'll talk to is you.
well...
Yeah, okay. I'll be right there.
is everything okay?
Nah, not really.
okay. You know, if you have to go, Ryan, go.
it's fine, really. I get it.
you do?
no, I don't, but I get that something is pulling you under, and I get that you can't let it go.
so whatever it is, please, just go deal with it, and find me when you're done.
I'm right here.
I wasn't looking for you.
but I'm here now.
whatever this game is you're playing, you can stop it.
you don't want me to go away.
Really? What makes you say that?
you're lonely.
right. Well, thanks for the analysis.
I feel much better.
no, look... if you need a break from everything going on in there...
I can help.
I think I'm doing just fine on my own.
you must be Ryan. - Kim?
I'm so glad you're here.
she's in there, still won't come out.
Jess, it's me, open up.
you came.
Yeah, what is it?
what are you so upset about, huh?
I thought that I could have some friends over, and then I started missing you.
well, let's go outside; they're worried about you.
no, no, no!
I don't want to be with my friends.
I want to be in here with you.
Yeah, well, that's not a good idea.
are you kidding?
this is the first good idea I've had.
Jim and Trey, none of the other guys knew how to take care of me.
you know how to take care of me, Ryan.
all right.
it's okay.
Hey!
you moving on already, is that what this is?
if you want to settle this with someone, settle it with me.
you want to talk outside?
Yeah.
lock the door.
so what, you're seeing her now?
she's just a friend of my brother's.
not that guy Trey.
look... - What?
you got to take your brother's leftovers?
fight!
now, listen to me.
you got to stay away from this girl.
she's trying to start over, you got to let her.
none of your business, man.
you're right.
that's why I'm leaving.
Ryan, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
look, Jess, if you're smart, you'll stay away from him... and my brother.
of course, I will, after the way you fought for me.
look, you got to stop dating guys like him.
and I got to stop dating girls like you.
take care of yourself.
hello.
Taylor, I really don't want to talk to you about my sex problems with Summer.
okay, okay, so the intimacy exercises were a miserable failure, but I don't think you should lose hope.
why, do you have some sort of secret cure?
as a matter of fact, I do.
it's called raunchy sex.
now, now, you don't see me as a sexual being, Seth.
I mean, I get that.
but without revealing too much, if sex were a martial art,
I would be a black belt.
weirdly, I'm not surprised.
now, I would like to talk to you about a little something called the Kama Sutra.
how do you know all this?
okay.
position one.
Seth, do you want your sparks back with Summer?
Yes.
then listen and learn.
okay, this is the yanni, and this is the lingam.
look, Matt may not have shown the best of judgment, but it nothing I'd fire him over.
and the "sacrificing one life to save the many" argument?
I don't get it.
the board loves you, Henry.
one phone call from you, nobody has to sacrifice anyone.
what makes you think I would do that? - Business.
our plan is the best one, you know that.
it makes me wonder about the board, though.
that they'd scrap a lucrative project over something like this.
it makes no sense from a business perspective, but... maybe it's personal.
this is about Maya.
isn't it?
she cried for days over him.
I'm sorry, Henry...
but you didn't have to lie to me.
I'm just a father looking after his daughter.
reason and logic don't stand a chance.
I understand that.
all different kinds of loyalty, Sandy, I chose mine.
now you choose yours.
what's it going to be?
hospital or Matt?
Hey, Coop.
you okay, Summ?
Yeah, just Cohen called.
he's coming over, he wants to talk.
it doesn't bode well.
well, maybe he's coming to patch things up.
or maybe he's coming over to break up with me.
anyway, it means that I can't hang out tonight, okay?
Oh, hey, I totally understand.
just call me later.
okay.
Hey.
Hey, how'd it go?
fine. Fine.
Matt called a couple of times.
he sounded nervous.
Yeah.
I'll let you talk to him.
I'm going to go lock up the house.
Oh, hey.
I- I didn't know you were here.
Yeah.
didn't you have a date with Sadie tonight?
almost, but then...
that girl Jess again?
Yeah, I think I finally learned my lesson, but now it might be too late.
it's never too late.
you just have to talk to her
Hey, am I interrupting?
princess Sparkles is here for emotional support, helping to cushion me before the fall.
well, you may want to put her in her drawer, 'cause I don't think she should see - what's about to happen. - That bad?
no, for the next 20 minutes, or 24 hours, if I turn out to be Sting, you have to keep an open mind.
what are you talking about?
now, if you'll be so kind as to disrobe, we will begin with the wheelbarrow position.
Oh, my God.
where, some pervy Internet chat room?
no, no, no.
it was very tasteful. Taylor came over...
what?
Taylor, like, came over to your house and gave you one-on-one sex education?
is that a no to the wheelbarrow? - I'll wheelbarrow you.
Hi.
my brother and I used to play with these when we were little.
especially when my mom was drinking.
we'd...
go in the back bedroom and play cars and...
pretend we didn't hear anything.
he always used to tell me that...
he'd save up and buy us a Camaro one day.
we'd blow town and never come back.
it wasn't going to happen, so...
one day, he tried to steal one.
I was there.
somehow that landed me here and him in Vegas.
now we don't talk anymore.
and you didn't tell me because...?
I- I guess I'm not used to unloading on people.
too busy being loaded on, I guess.
I don't know.
but I wanted to start over with you.
you know, I have many talents.
one of them is listening.
you've just got to let me do it.
deal.
that's not to say we should just be talking.
whoa.
Yeah, whoa.
you know, it's a good thing
I put Princess Sparkle away for that.
to think it was that amazing, and we didn't even get to the wheelbarrow.
you know, we should make a pact.
if we go away to college together, we should, like, fight, like, every day.
I'm pretty sure I can make that happen.
sorry. - Oh, no.
I'm officially giving up men.
you cannot live without a man, not even for a week.
I will not so much as bat an eyelash at a man, and you will stay out of trouble.
solar panels on all our dormitories or we revolt!
seth: I just want to give you room to keep doing what you're doing, 'cause I think it's pretty amazing.
so if you don't hear from me for a while, it's not because I don't love you; it's because I do.
the only way I can get a divorce is if one of us was unfaithful, and I didn't think you'd sign if you knew the truth.
getting mixed up in other people's lives and helping them out of jams, seems to be what you do.
Bollywood, huh?
I didn't know you're such a world cinema buff, especially at 2: 30 in the morning.
what are you doing up?
I had a dream Summer was marrying Ralph Nader and I was playing the marimba at the wedding.
good gig. Why don't you call her?
I'm giving her space, remember?
I promised myself I'd wait at least a week before calling.
what are they dancing about?
this guy just saw his girlfriend's ankle. Hmm.
you think it's about time to talk to someone?
nobody ever died of insomnia.
fine. You know what?
I'm sort of in the mood for a chaste Hindu love story with lots of needless dancing.
Seth, go to bed.
no can do.
if you're awake, I'm awake.
come on.
love is...
nice.
thank you.
you know, you'd be a lot sharper if you didn't sleep on the couch.
you know, maybe you should invest in some less-comfortable furniture.
why don't you chew on that for a while?
morning, all.
Hey, how'd it go?
Oh. I'll get it.
five feet, glassy, and I got that skinflint Sweeton to pledge $30, 000 to the PD's Youth Outreach Program.
Oh, they are so lucky that you are organizing that event.
you are amazing.
Mm...
Uh-huh.
what do you need?
I just need a slogan for New Match.
so far, your son has come up with "Love is Nice," and "Love Schmov."
love is a smoke made with the fumes of sighs; being purged a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes.
Taylor, that's beautiful.
Julie left this in my car.
so, um, I was in the neighborhood,
I thought I'd drop it by in case you needed it.
Oh, thank you. I'm going to go give Ryan some coffee.
um, I can do that.
thank you.
Hello?
: easy, girl.
Taylor, what are you doing here?
um, I'm just, uh, bringing Kirsten some papers.
this is for you.
Oh, thanks, but actually, I'm kind of not drinking coffee right now.
Oh.
well, Ryan, I just wanted to thank you again for helping me with my husband, and I am... You don't have to pay me back.
are you kidding?
if it wasn't for you, I would be in France right now, trapped in a loveless marriage.
you saved my life, and I am at your command.
anything you want... anything.
you could hand me that shirt.
you joker.
here.
um, I'm serious.
you're not getting out of this so easily.
you know, in some cultures, they say that if you save someone's life, you're bound to them forever.
Oh.
Bye.
here she comes.
you know, it's odd, but I never appreciated how funny Ryan is.
life -- such a journey.
well, have a nice day.
she said Ryan was funny.
Oh, my God.
wake up! Wake up!: Oh, what are you doing?
it's almost 8: 00. You have to get out of here before my daughter wakes up.
Oh, my God.
are you my new daddy?
Oh, uh, good morning.
I'm, I'm your mom's personal trainer.
we were just doing an early morning workout.
Oh, really?
how much do you charge for that?
well...
save it, okay?
if my mom wants to club five nights a week, sleep till noon, and hook up with some 25-year-old Bavarian beefcake, it just means she's got less time for me.
the door is that way, Hans.
okay.
you are having breakfast alone?
Yeah, why? Who else would be here?
no one.
uh, although my new personal trainer was going to come over.
you know, we single women have to stay in shape.
well, I'm sure he'll give you a very good workout.
Oh, no.
good, you're here.
actually, I was just, I was...
you might want to sit down.
I have huge news and a favor to ask you.
you like Ryan and you want my help convincing him to date you?
Wow.
you said he was funny; that's kind of a giveaway.
I know, it's crazy.
I mean, I've always thought "Cute guy, "might be good for a night of rough-and-tumble fun, but it's not like we have anything in common.
so ignore it. It's probably just gas.
but then when he helped me with my husband and he kissed me, it was like Dorothy landing in Oz.
everything just popped into Technicolor.
Ah.
you think I don't know what that means?
I said, "Ah.
meaning, "Ah, that Taylor, she is so pathetic."
someone's the least bit nice to her and she becomes totally obsessed with them.
first me, and then her French husband when he lent her a subway ticket, now Ryan.
well, you know, isn't it kind of true?
so what?
Yes, I have a psychological predilection to become romantically attached to men who are nice to me due to the fact that I was raised by a she-wolf of a mother who practiced emotional terrorism.
does that mean that if by some miracle, love does come into my life, I should deny it?
what kind of person would that make me?
what kind of life...
Taylor, what do you want me to do?
find out if he's ready to start dating.
okay.
Hello?
seth: Hey, you're doing a great job.
RYAN: Thanks.
did you finish the movie last night?
Uh-huh. Uh, which one?
are you ready to date again?
what?
simple question.
I have no idea. Why?
okay, cool.
he's not sure.
listen, you don't want to get involved with him right now, okay?
he slept like four hours in the last week.
he's a mess.
Really? Interesting.
excuse me?
can you not do that now?
excuse me.
Hey, we're supposed to clean, buddy.
Yeah, and I am in the middle of something.
what's this one's name?
don't touch that.
they're part of an experiment.
you're a janitor? Uh-huh.
uh, you know, we can just go.
Betty, we'll come back later.
Yes, Lou, we should go.
so you're going to hold the ball gently, okay, like, um, like you're holding ice cream.
I stopped eating ice cream.
so what do you eat? Nonfat, non-dairy yogurt.
fine, hold the ball like nonfat yogurt.
okay.
but if I serve this one in, you have to go out with me.
Kaitlin, how many times I got to say this?
you're 15.
so a kiss is still out of the question?
just serve the ball.
there it is, it's over the net.
well, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to squeeze me in for a training session tonight.
Mm-hmm.
easy girl.
hold on a second.
eye on the ball. Come on.
Kaitlin, you didn't tell me you had a new instructor.
Hi, I'm Julie Cooper, Kaitlin's mother.
how you doing? Spencer.
uh, your daughter, she's got a lot of potential.
Mm-hmm.
so you play?
Oh, no, I used to, but...
I was actually thinking about getting back into it.
Wow.
Hey. You're early.
well, I wanted to see the new place up and running...
and give you this. Oh...
so Julie already took off, huh?
she had to pick up Kaitlin at tennis.
Oh, it's a Wonder Woman paperweight.
Seth gave me his employee discount.
well, it may end up being a souvenir.
what are you talking about?
remember that woman that I told you about in Laguna that has a high-end dating service?
Yeah, she's going to retire, sell you her client list.
well, she got another offer, four times ours, and right now we don't have enough money to counter, which means that all of this could be short-lived.
what about taking on a backer?
I could you put in touch with the donors I've been talking to.
I'm playing golf tomorrow with Gordon Bullet.
the oil tycoon? Yeah.
didn't he go to jail for tax evasion?
Yeah, but he's out now.
I had dinner with him last month.
he's really not a bad guy for being a total pig.
I don't know.
we just wanted to do this ourselves.
and besides, having a silent partner, they always have an opinion.
well, it's my impression he's got a lot of fish to fry.
so I doubt he'd be involved in your day-to-day, but I could ask him.
okay.
Thanks.
: clear.
did you find out what they were doing with them?
does it matter?
if it wasn't evil, they wouldn't have to keep them locked in cages like animals.
what's the plan again?
the plan is to set them loose and then lead them to the forest.
the forest, across the river.
lead them, how? I brought my flute.
your flute? Like the Pied Piper?
uh, no, scientific study shows that music actually triggers a reaction inside the pleasure center of the rabbit's brain.
check this out.
: Ah...
feel his heartbeat. It's calmer.
it's just to keep them calm.
but trust me, as soon as they feel the free air on their faces, they're going to be leading us.
Hi.
you're a fat bunny.
you're name is Pancakes. Did you know that?
huh? Pancakes.
Hey, come here.
okay, when I open this door we've got about 60 seconds till the storm troopers arrive.
you ready to do this?
Yeah.
welcome to liberty, my friends.
come on, Pancakes.
Ryan, you can't sleep, can you?
you poor thing.
it's 3: 00 in the morning.
Seth told me everything.
but lucky for you, junior year, I won the state science fair for my study in sleep disorders.
I can help you.
Oh, well, that's really nice, but actually, you know, I'm fine.
it's the middle of the night, and you're wide awake.
so are you.
well, I never sleep more than four hours a night.
it's unproductive. Ryan, don't you see, this is how I'll pay you back.
Yeah. You know what?
actually, I'm kind of tired.
stop lying.
I want you to meet me tomorrow morning at 8: 00, at the diner.
and I won't take no for an answer.
fine.
yeah?
good night.
good night, Taylor.
okay, just relax.
be normal.
you can do this.
good morning, Ryan.
Hi.
Oh, you poor thing. You look exhausted.
Yeah, well, look, Taylor, I don't know what Seth told you, but I'm fine, really.
I've got work, so... Did you sleep at all last night?
no, but, uh... And how about the night before?
Ryan, insomnia can go on for months.
what's the harm in letting me try and help you?
fire away.
okay. So, um, first off...
how much of this is related to Marissa?
I'm really sorry to ask, but if that's what's going on, I think we need to know.
well, I need to know.
it's not about her.
it started after Thanksgiving.
hmm.
right after Volchok turned himself in?
Yeah, I guess, why?
Ryan, I'm just spit-balling here...
but, um, this is the guy you wanted revenge on, right?
so you probably went to bed every night thinking, "I'll get him tomorrow."
but now that purpose is gone, so what's the point in going to bed if there's no point in waking up?
I hadn't thought about that.
Oh, my God.
I am such an awesome sleep therapist.
and this is only our first session.
Yeah, listen, I better go.
Yes.
but, uh, thanks. This was, uh...
good.
well, my pleasure.
: Bye.
you ready?
nice shot, Julie.
thank you, Spencer.
you know, this is supposed to be my tennis lesson.
don't you think it's fun to do mother-daughter stuff?
please.
come on, keep your eye on the ball, Kaitlin. Let's go.
bring it back, up, and very nice.
back, up and...
very nice. Mm-hmm.
do you mind?
it's the third time.
sorry.
Ow. Ooh.
are you all right?
this will help with the serve. Right.
I think I really strained it.
I'm strong.
Spencer: You are strong. I'm pretty impressed.
Julie: Ooh, perfect.
Where's my racket?
Oh, that's weird.
you know, I'm ready when you are.
well, I get that she did a fine job in that whole Middle East thing, but I'm sorry, Madeline Albright -- not hot.
I told you to call me Bullet.
well, Bullet, call me crazy, but maybe Madeline Albright doesn't need to be hot.
Oh, well, that's an interesting point of view, Sandy.
Hey, your donation to the PD's Outreach Program was really generous, thank you.
Oh, well, you caught me at the right time.
I was in bed with those Arab fellas.
that's a metaphor.
them boys cooked the books on me, so I sold out.
left them high and dry.
they never should have messed with old Bullet.
bang.
all right.
look at that.
Shii-ite Muslim.
you see, the point is, I'm cash-rich right now, and I don't know what to do with all the stuff.
Really?
cigar?
no, thanks. They're Cuban.
commie bastards do one thing right.
you know, my wife just started a business, and she and her partner are thinking about taking on investors.
in fact, you could talk to them about it tomorrow at the benefit -- you know, get the details.
well, I don't think I'm going tomorrow, Sandy.
you see, my date went back to her husband.
I'm going to do you a favor.
you should talk to my wife, because that's the business she's in, and her partner is newly single.
she hot?
and I was into recycling way before it was cool.
al Gore got half that stuff from a paper I wrote in sixth grade.
I just don't, you know, make a stink, because he's doing good work.
well, when are you allowed to call Summer again?
10: 03 tomorrow. Am I driving you crazy? No, no.
Hi, Seth. Ryan, I need your keys. I have to get your room ready.
what?
Oh, I'm Ryan's sleep therapist.
right.
uh, that's your tacos.
because you can't. Why not?
I did not tell you about Ryan's sleep problems, so you could use it for some weirdo seduction.
I'm not... Are you a sleep therapist? Are you certified?
sleep ther... Do you have a little certificate from the American Institute of... uh, the sleep place?
and what if I can help him? He wins, I win. They call it win-win for a reason.
it doesn't matter. You can't.
just say what you're really thinking, Seth.
RYAN: Hey...
everything okay?
Yeah. Great.
could you go get me some pico de gallo?
Yeah. Sure.
it's true -- you don't think I'm good enough. That's crazy.
Oh, Taylor, she's so funny, what a kook, but her and Ryan, please.
you need help, do you know that?
I mean, she's no Marissa.
exactly.
here you go.
Thanks, I've got to get back to the shop.
TAYLOR: Yeah, I better go, too.
Hey, Amber. "Did Seth..."?
your boyfriend didn't call.
I thought he was giving you space.
uh... he is. It doesn't mean that I can't call him.
oldest trick in the book.
I'm giving you space so you can call first and look like the needy one.
Seth isn't doing that.
of course not. Oh, but the dean's office called.
they want to see you tomorrow.
what? Did they say what for?
no.
Hey, did you hear that someone set free the bunnies in one of the science labs?
huh, really?
well, maybe someone thought it was inhumane.
maybe someone didn't know they were only being studied for their socialization patterns and lived a pretty cushy life.
by the way, there's a rabbit under your bed.
I got the call, too.
that scientist picked us out of a face book.
apparently the chiseled features of freedom, not that hard to recognize.
what are you going to do? Breathe, caterpillar.
it's all going to be okay.
I went through the same exact thing when they tried to frame me for flooding the trustee dinner.
but you did flood the trustees' dinner.
Yeah, but they didn't know that. Flax and Oats?
I don't think I can lie.
of course you can't.
no more than the wind could lie, or a tree.
Oh... I have to go write a song.
I just came by to tell you that I am with you until the end.
but, Che, what if they kick us out?
then in the words of the great Chief Aupumut
I will sing my death song and die like a warrior going home.
pancakes.
I thought we were going to the beach.
in a minute. I just want him to see me in my bikini first.
you mean you want him to molest you.
all right, shut up. I have real feelings for this guy...
Oh, my God.
wow, looks like your mom has some feelings, too
for that guy's butt.
dude, why are you talking about that guy's butt? Shut up.
you're so gay sometimes.
Oh, my God.
welcome home, Ryan.
this, um... Are you wearing pajamas?
Oh, yes. Many people sleep better with a warm body beside them.
don't worry. It's completely non-sexual.
Yeah.
I've got to ask, though.
is this...
I mean, you don't, you don't like me, do you?
Yeah, I like you. We're friends.
no, I mean, the, um...
Oh.
Oh...
my goodness, no.
no, no, no, no, no.
I just, you know, I want to pay you back and, um...
I happen to be really interested in sleep disorders.
okay.
great. Shall we start with a massage?
Oh!
Whoa!
what the...?
Hey, what are you doing here?
me? What are you doing here?
uh, bringing Ryan coffee, and I live here.
did you stay the night?
no.
well, yeah, kind of.
can I just have one of these?
you didn't put any sweetener in, did you?
cause I read that aspartame can cause brain tumors quicker than you can say Jack Robinson. Hey.
I was just helping Ryan with his sleep.
have you seen him? He was gone when I woke up.
Hey! I went for a jog. Uh...
Oh.
Yeah.
it's, uh, this isn't what it looks like.
totally.
Yeah, you know...
well, kind of.
we did sleep in the same bed.
no, actually, uh, you slept in the bed.
I was reading in the chair all night.
this is too weird for this early in the morning.
I'm just going to... here.
well, that was good.
so you really didn't sleep at all?
is it because I snored?
my mom always wanted me to get an operation for a deviated septum.
you didn't snore.
we should talk about what happened so I can adjust the plan for tonight.
Taylor, look, I appreciate everything you've done.
I really do.
and I think you're probably right about Volchok.
but I also think it's something I need to go through on my own.
so let's call it even, okay?
okay.
all right.
I'm going to go jump in the pool.
so what, Sandy just served me up like a piece of meat?
how rich is he?
5: 00 will be fine.
Hi, honey.
you going on a date?
Yes, I'm going to Sandy's delinquent benefit with a man called "The Bullet."
apparently, he owns Texas.
Oh, well, that sounds like fun.
um, do you think Mr. Cohen would mind if I crashed?
Yeah, I think that'd be okay.
I'll have to leave you some cab money.
well, what if I invited a friend who drives?
that works, too.
it's nice to see you interested in charity.
that's me.
ms. Roberts, the reason we called you in today...
I helped free the bunnies.
I didn't know that they were only being studied for how they interacted.
I know it doesn't excuse it.
well, the board appreciates your candor.
can you tell us who else was involved?
no, I'm sorry.
I see.
there have been other acts of political activism this semester that cross the line of legality:
an incident at the Board of Trustees Dinner...
I wasn't involved in that.
do you know who was?
ms. Roberts, the severity of your punishment will be influenced by how cooperative you are today.
Dean -- other deans, I really, really love Brown.
I have changed so much here.
but I'm afraid if I tell you who did those other things, then I'd be betraying the new me, and I can't do that.
one final question.
there is still one rabbit missing.
I don't know anything about that.
Taylor, did you take my lip gloss with the bee pheromones in it?
it's on the dresser.
are you okay?
Yeah, peachy.
... Talk.
okay, what do you do when you like a boy and he barely knows you're alive and you already pretended to be his sleep therapist and... I'm out of options?
okay.
well, this may sound a little weird, but try dressing up fabulous and going to a place where you know you'll run into him.
that's it?
that's it.
that really works?
almost every time.
and I mean, touching his arm when you guys are talking is always good and dancing and body contact.
and laugh at his jokes.
I mean, even if they're not that funny.
Ooh, I-I do that already.
okay, what else?
you could walk in front of him, I mean, if he's a butt guy.
I don't know if he's a butt guy.
well, it can't hurt.
I mean, girl, you've got a great butt.
you are such a sweetie.
tell me more.
Sandy: I just want to thank you again on behalf of the entire Public Defender's Office.
so please, drink, dance and have a great time.
thank you.
hello.
this is wonderful.
thank you.
so how's Julie and The Bullet doing?
see for yourself.
so there was this big, white-tailed Texas deer coming across there, so I wheel around like Dick Cheney and go... bang!
Oh!
I got him. Bang!
Hello, Ryan.
Taylor, hi.
you look, um...
I look nice?
nice, yeah, that's the word I was looking for.
well, so do you.
would you like to dance?
actually, I'm not much of a dancer.
it's probably shocking.
maybe the exercise will tire you out.
not that this is therapy.
no, we're not doing that anymore.
it's just, you know, fun.
Yeah, okay.
okay.
okay, just a second.
he wants to talk numbers Monday.
who? The Bullet.
he's getting drinks.
but he's in, Kiki. He loves New Match.
that's great.
I know.
mom.
look at who I brought with me.
what are you doing here?
you said your mom told you to bring me.
uh, Julie, what's going on?
is that your date?
you and I will talk later.
bullet, this is...
what the hell are you doing here, boy?
you know each other?
you're on a date with my dad?
what?
what?
Oh, God.
you ditching my party already?
I was thinking about calling Summer.
I'm not supposed to call her until 10: 03, but technically, it is 10: 03 on the East Coast, so that's not cheating, is it?
sorry, Seth.
I'd say, yeah, that'd be cheating.
Hey, did I see Taylor leaving the pool house this morning?
Yeah, she's pretending to be Ryan's sleep therapist so he falls in love with her.
that's new.
that'd explain the way they're dancing in there.
I hope it works out.
you're supporting this seduction plot?
well, you don't have to be a shrink to see that Ryan's still working through things.
you know, I think he could use the human connection.
Yeah, but those two... I don't know.
well, they're not the most obvious couple, but then neither were you and Summer once upon a time.
and Taylor thinks Ryan is funny.
we-we did not hate you.
Oh, you totally hated me.
come on, you were probably the president of the "We Hate Taylor Club."
I was the secretary.
I took the notes.
Ryan, you made a real joke.
Yeah, well, a pretty bad one.
but I made a real joke.
thank you, but don't tell anyone.
Oh.
you want a drink?
that'd be nice.
okay.
Hey. Hey.
I saw you dancing with Taylor.
Yeah, is that look supposed to mean something or...?
crazier things have happened.
nothing I can recall this instant, but...
okay, I don't think so. Ask yourself why.
she's smart, she's funny.
dude, just forget about it, okay?
I'm not going to date Taylor.
um, I was just...
excuse me.
Taylor, Taylor, Taylor... Hold on, let me explain.
Oh, I think you were pretty clear, Ryan.
and, yes, I lied when you asked me if I liked you.
but...
what was I even thinking?
I mean, you and me...
I must be totally crazy.
you're not crazy, okay?
Ryan, I pretended to be a sleep therapist to seduce you.
that was crazy.
don't worry, because I'm sure next week I'll be totally obsessed with some guy who gives me change for parking.
look, what I said has absolutely nothing to do with you, okay?
it's just... What?
that for the longest time all you could feel was your desire to kill Volchok, now that's gone, so you feel empty.
you can't feel anything, least of all anything for me.
how do you keep doing that?
doing what?
that -- you keep telling me what I'm thinking before I feel it.
because I think about you.
you know, I want you to be happy, and I think that if you gave it a chance, you might feel something, too.
are you going to tell me that you really like me as a friend?
maybe.
how does she do that?
do you have any idea what you just did in there?
screwed up things with your new boyfriend?
thought you were all, "I'm off men."
I'm going to start focusing on the new business.
that was about business, Kaitlin.
that man was going to give us money, money that we need.
then why'd you have to hook up with Spencer?
I mean, couldn't you see that I liked him?
he's ten years older than you, and no, I couldn't see that.
well, I was flirting with him.
you flirt with everybody. So do you.
you're 15 years old.
and you're my mother.
I don't have to see guys sneaking down the stairs while I'm trying to eat breakfast.
it makes me want to barf. That...
that is completely fair.
Oh, my God, honey. What is wrong with me?
I am so sorry.
it's okay.
just try to pick one guy.
one that I don't like.
how did you know that Spencer was Bullet's son?
I didn't.
it was just coincidence?
that's weird.
summer, hey. What are you doing?
waiting for you.
have you been talking to the board this whole time?
summer, have I accomplished anything this semester?
are you kidding?
che, there would be no political activism at Brown without you.
Oh, my God, are you getting kicked out?
no, no, but I think you might be.
what?
Yeah, they needed a scapegoat.
you said yourself, I'm too important to the movement, so...
what did you tell them, Che?
uh, just that you flooded the trustee's dinner, and disabled the maintenance vehicles in October...
and, well, there's a whole list of stuff.
I was only going to say a couple, but then, you know,
I thought, if Summer's going down anyways...
may as well have her go down in style.
well, Che, you did all of those things and I protected you.
I know.
and the movement will never forget it.
shut up about the movement, okay?
this is not Cuba.
we are in college. We have dining cards.
I'm going to get kicked out. Caterpillar.
no, okay, don't call me that. Okay, just stay away from me.
well, fine.
fine. You'll have your money tomorrow.
senators.
well, if it's not the little pot stirrer.
have you seen my idiot son?
he's probably somewhere banging his head against the wall.
dude, no one cares that he's your son.
you should invest in my mother's business.
or what? You going to tell everyone what a meanie old Bullet is and I'm going to have to sit alone at lunch?
Oh, boo-hoo, boo-hoo.
my mother is awesome.
she ran the Newport Group.
and when she broke up with her fiancee, she got his house.
she'll make you a lot of money.
already got a lot of money, squirt.
just thought it might be some fun.
well, if that's all you're in for, then knowing my mother, will be the best investment you've ever made.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
tired?
exhausted.
Hey, how'd it go with the Bullet?
well, as it turns out, Julie was dating his 25-year-old son.
Ooh. That's a weird coincidence.
that about sums it up.
sandy, mind if I borrow your wife for a second?
come on, blondie, I won't bite.
Hey, you ready to go home?
Yeah. Where's Spencer?
I figured you guys would have made up and he'd be showing you his half volley.
I told him it's over and that if he ever came near you again,
I would crush him.
KIRSTEN: Julie? We're back on.
bullet wants to come by the office on Monday.
what?
apparently Kaitlin can be quite persuasive.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Yeah, I got game.
Mm-hmm.
you want to get some ice cream?
I stopped eating.
what the hell.
the guy at the ice cream store is so hot.
that's my girl.
well, close enough.
Taylor, what are you doing in here?
when I had really bad insomnia last year, a Chinese doctor gave me this herbal tea.
and I thought it might help Ryan sleep.
I would have given it to him before, but I was trying to seduce him.
so... So why can't you just give it to him?
because I'm too embarrassed.
you were totally right.
here I am, getting a divorce, I'm living like a refugee at Julie's.
Ryan's nice to me so I fall for him?
it's just totally pathetic.
just please give that to him.
wow, I never thought I'd see you quitting.
well, it's completely hopeless, Seth. You heard him.
Yeah, I know, just you're rolling over like an old dog.
not the Taylor I remember.
are you seriously trying to Jedi mind trick me?
Taylor Townsend, quitter.
I guess I'll just have to get used to that.
fine.
hello.
Hey.
Hey. Summer, I was just about to call you.
Oh, you were? Yeah.
I wanted to call you, but I didn't want to seem needy.
are you kidding? I been wanting to call you all week.
Seth, you still love me, right?
of course I do. What's going on?
well...
I got a rabbit.
okay.
what's its name?
wait, no, let me guess.
is it Cyclotron? No.
are you lying?
is it, uh, Gorgon the Destroyer of Carrots?
: no.
is it Larry?
you're not Larry.
Hi.
Hey.
um, I brought you some tea.
I'm not trying to be your therapist again.
I just thought it might help you sleep.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, God, what am I doing.
wait, hold on. Look, I've got to say something.
um...
I think you've got this idea that you're this strange person that has to trick people into liking you.
that's not true.
you're, um...
you're amazing.
Oh, my God. You just did it to me.
did what?
you said exactly what I was feeling.
well, except for the amazing part.
well, it's true.
honestly, you know, I wish I did feel something.
kiss me.
uh, what?
I think there's something there.
and I think that if you kiss me you'll feel it, too.
I think we already did that.
Nope, uh-uh.
you kissed me, I didn't kiss you.
come on.
just... If you don't feel anything, I will never mention it again.
that's the best deal you'll ever get.
ask Seth.
just one kiss.
one kiss.
one kiss.
okay. Okay.
okay. Okay.
I'm sorry.
whoa.
summer: Thanks for talking to me, Cohen. I really miss you.
get some sleep, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I love you. I love you, too.
Hey, I figured you'd be up.
I just wanted to check and see If there's anything you needed Before I went on my maternity leave.
Yeah, I'm pregnant.
great. Well, I'll write up the order.
okay, thanks. - Wait a minute. You can't do that.
you cannot exploit your baby for sales.
Hey, did I tell you we're going to have a baby?
Oh, thank you very much.
I'm excite...Definitely.
no. No! You need to come by your sales honorably.
there is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it.
Hey, there. Dwight schrute here.
listen, uh, would you be interested In restocking on paper?
Yeah, I could sure use the money.
my cousin came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.
Oh, it's just horrific.
the doctor says he's never seen it beard so quickly. Okay.
I need a baby. I'll never outsell jim and pam without one.
also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.
sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
Kevin, you're such a gourmand.
I cooked my way through julia child's cookbook,
and now I'm halfway through the twilight cookbook.
last night I had edward's cornflake chicken.
pregnant pam and I, We get hungry at the same times,
so we've been eating together a lot...
not all meals, just second breakfast, Lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
I thought that maybe we should do something special For early dinner, - One last ultra-feast.- Mmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking?
I think it should be a surprise.
Ooh, getting there, huh? - I still have time.
I'm having contractions, But they're irregular and far apart.
so I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.
Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid hmo.
if we check in after midnight,
I get an extra day to recuperate, Surrounded by doctors.
not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital Will be very nice, because once we bring the baby home,
if it's crying all night, One of us is gonna have to take care of it.
and I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
contraptions"! She's "contrapting." Okay, you know what?
I think that I should drive you guys to the hospital, And here is why.
I am a licensed class "c" driver in the state of pennsylvania.
Michael... - I gas up the car. Actually,
I put diesel in this time...
try to save some money. - Michael, you shouldn't have done that.
happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job Baby-proofing this office.
you know the baby's not gonna live here, right?
well, the baby was conceived here,
so it might as well live here a little bit too.
that logic's airtight, But unfortunately, it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-a-potty.
Yuck! T.M. I.How was it?
I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go!
hospital! - Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital.
we are waiting until midnight.
Ooh, spooky. But why?
because the insurance company only covers two nights.
everything's fine. We have plenty of time.
well, you don't want to wait too long, pam.
otherwise, the baby's gonna become a teenager in there,
and you'll be up all night from the rock music.
shut up, nick. God! What a weird thing to say, Weird I. T.Nerd.
don't get revenge on me, nerd.
what are you looking at?
nerd.
did you know that labor can last weeks?
and they take your insides out, And they just plop 'em on a table.
and sometimes epidurals don't work. And you can poop yourself.
bear my child.
excuse me?
I want to have a child for business reasons, And I want you to be the mother.
if you agree, say nothing.
if you disagree, say anything.
very well.
let's meet at 4: 00 p. M. At our old meeting spot And bang it out.
all right, that's seven minutes.
here we go. - Hold on, hold on.
are...Are you serious? Pam... - It isn't midnight yet.
no, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
I'm gonna be okay. We should really try to make it to midnight.
Pam, please. - No, you really should, 'cause if your baby's born tomorrow,
he's gonna have the same birthday as buttmud brooks, My old roommate.
did you hear that? Buttmud brooks.
okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart. - Five minutes apart.
so the plan was seven minutes.
but we're calling an audible, because that's her call,'cause she's the quarterback.
I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
okay, okay, okay, okay...Okay, stop watching me. - Okay, crazy.
I think I have some better things to do with my day Than worry about you, like sell printers.
well, now till Friday, 20% off all toner cartridges.
that's a big deal. While we're on the subject,
why don't I just run you down to the hospital and just do a quick check?
not till midnight.
guys...
a word of advice, speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names.
I was named Walter Jr.after my father,
until I was about six or so, When my parents changed their minds.
I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
my brother was born,
and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr.name, so they gave it to him.
I was given "Andrew," Which they got out of a baby-name book.

maybe you guys should all go back to work, - 'cause the day's not out yet. - No, no, no. You know what?

I feel like this noise is gonna prevent pam
from being able to listen to her body's signals.
actually, the distractions are good.
I mean, I don't think I'm gonna make it till midnight

and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one.
stimulate the nipples. - Okay, nobody touch pam's nipples.
think of pam's nipples as toby's grundle.
her shirt is touching them.

by the bushes? - Okay, Michael, focus!
okay, go, go, go, go, go! - Guys, come on!
let's go!
I love escorting people.
in fact, a few years back,
I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.
got a lot of responses...
mostly creeps.
made a few friends.
all right, here we go. - Okay!
you're doing great! - Just breathe.
she'll be here soon. - She? You found out?
come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised.
Michael! - Yeah?

I'm texting about you, okay?
Ah! All right...

Oh, you're kidding me!
pull over!
you're not allowed to impersonate a police officer.
don't make this difficult, Dwight.
wait...
wait! My ipod's not in here!
okay. - It has the birth song on it.
okay, I know, I know, but my ipod is in the go-bag.
we'll be fine. - Jim, I don't want
the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 mile soundtrack.
so what do you wanna do? - I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it.
it's only 20 minutes past the hospital!
Pam, Pam, no. Are you nuts?
we're going to the hospital now. - Guys, guys, stop fighting.
come on. Come on!
do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?
right?
okay, you know what?
I am all over this.
here we go. Ready?
Dwight schrute.
Hello, Dwight.
Pam left her ipod at her house.
I want you to swing by, pick it up,
and bring it to the hospital.
we need it yesterday.
then why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday?
I kept I. M.Ing you how bored I was.
okay... - Dwight!
go to my house, get my ipod.
I think it's on the kitchen table.
do not touch anything else. The key is underneath...
I don't need a key. - Okay, Dwight,
but if you do need a key, just listen, it's under...
no, don't, don't. Don't tell me.
Dwight, just listen to me!
do you have everything, guys?
Michael, just go park the car.
okay. All right.
sir... - Dunder Mifflin. It's okay.
you can't park here.
I just did.
Pam's doing great.
uh, she's ten inches dilated now...
sorry, meters... centimeters.
uh, and she's also fully effaced,
which I don't know what that is.
uh, but no baby yet.
it's only been 6... 19 hours.
and, uh, I was sent out for some ice chips, 'cause I might have passed out a little bit.
but these are very refreshing, very good.
daddy. She's ready to push.
okay.
Where's my little nibblet?
Halpert, room d-1. All right.
family only beyond this point.
thank you!
there we go.
you're doing great. Push again.
not yet. - No, don't push. Pull.
why don't you get some more ice chips?
no, Jim, stay!
okay, really push this time, pam.
okay!
Nope, not yet, not yet, not yet.
gotta go wash my eyes.
that kid's gonna have a lot of hair.
Ha...have you guys seen her? - She hasn't popped yet.
what? Ah, damn it!
she was supposed to come out yesterday.
I decided to give baby halpert a newspaper
from the day she was born.
this frame set me back 55 bones.
but she decided to take her sweet time,
so now I have to switch it with today's paper.
this is ridiculous. We just can't wait here.
I think it's gonna be any minute now.
but you don't know that.
I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Oh, my god! Go, go, go!
are you insane?
all right.
guys? Hello?
you're doing great.
um... - You're doing great.
just relax. - Sorry to be a bother,
but, uh, if we could have an e. T.A...
when this is gonna... - This isn't happening!
you're starting... you're kinda losing 'em.
Oh, my god!
look at her.
Pam, she's so beautiful. - Yeah!
Oh, my god. - Oh, my god!
that's right. It's a baby, see...
sir. Sir, you can't smoke that in here.
okay. - Put it...put it out.
all right.
can't smoke anywhere these days.
she's incredible.
you wanna count her fingers and toes again?
no. Let's let her rest.
I'm sure there's still 12 of each.
okay.
guys, guys!
her name is Cecilia Marie Halpert.
11 pounds... - She's 7 pounds...
7 pounds. - 2 ounces, 18 inches.
mother and daughter are doing great.
Congratulations.
here. - Hey, grandma's back.
well, it was an adventure and a half
trying to find the cafeteria,
but I have returned with the coffee.
Oh, thank god. I haven't had caffeine in nine months.
may I? - Yes.
Oh, somebody has a full diaper.
Oh. Let me get it.
I am a diapering master.
I've done little else in the past two months.
there is nothing I cannot diaper.
go ahead. Try to think of something.
I dare you.
Where's the baby?
I want to see the baby!
Hi.
my goodness, what are the odds of this?
congratulations on being a grandma.
Hello, Michael.
Hello!
Oh. How are you?
I'm, uh... - I worry about you.
you know, I think, uh...
I think it's time for me to go.
Oh. Okay.
love you.
love you, as a friend.
love you, mom.
I want to hold the baby!
okay. You just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
Oh, right.
again. No pants.
ready?
that's so weird.
she was saying it just before you got here.
yesterday I was dispatched to Jim and pam's house
to find Pam's ipod.
I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it.
what I did find... Was mold
and lots of it.
so I did what anyone would do.
I read a book had a bath got a good night's sleep and made plans to eradicate it.
I also borrow his
time to get to work.
there she sat. Her name was Pam.
she was a receptionist.
she was engaged to an animal.
there sat Jim.
he was a gawky, tall salesman.
the odds of them getting together
were insurmountainable.
I made a family.
I got these two together, and I made a family.
this man has a gift!
who else here is single?
I'm not single. I have a man.
I am offering up my services to you all.
you saw what I did with Pam and Jim.
I can help you too.
why don't you find someone for yourself
instead of meddling in our affairs?
okay, show of hands... who wants to live in a world where stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?
who else?
come on, people. I know models.
plus-size models maybe.
you got that right.
Meredith, come on. You're obviously single.
you know it. I am never getting married.
like clooney.
Andrew, what about you?
torn scrotum... still on the mend, so...
not good timing.
Yes, I'm gonna ask out erin.
I'm just waiting for the stars to align...
literally.
I have a small skylight in my bedroom,
and I'd like for the moon to be visible.
well, when you least expect it, expect it.
I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.
I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.
and, like cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.
remember yesterday
when we were terrified of being parents?
we were just kids.
what did we know?
Hey. How we doing?
good. - Great.
would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?
doesn't she sleep here? - She can.
uh, but a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest.
you've been through a lot.
I think we'll be okay.
okay. Great.
Oh! Big yawn.
ready? One, two, three.
one, and then wrap around.
it's okay. It's okay.
hold that arm down. - I can't. She's too strong.
careful, though. You don't wanna break it.
she's not gonna... just...
Pam, I got it.
all right. - Go, go.
arms out. - Nurse?
how you doing? - I don't know.
I just...I can't tell if she's getting anything.
Really? - It doesn't feel right.
well, you...you're pushing the milk out, right?
how would one do that?
wasn't it... it's kinda like a...
like...like that.
do you wanna try it, Jim?
I think you're good.
you're doing a good job.
somebody buzzed.
Oh, really? Must have sat on it, Pam.
I can't tell if she's getting anything.
it just doesn't really feel right.
well, maybe we should take a break for a little while.
I can take her to the nursery
and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.
even if she's not getting anything?
Yeah. She'll be fine.
I-I can always give her a bottle once we're in the nursery.
no. I-I read in the book about nipple confusion.
Oh, good. You know everything.
I mean, she's just...she's really tentative about latching.
and I just...I wanna keep her self-esteem up.
I'll bring her back in a little while,
and we can try again, okay?
all right. - Okay.
it's gonna be all right.
maybe itl be good, 'cause then she can, like, socialize with the other babies.
no. Yeah, that would... that would be good.
you wanted to see me?
what would you say if I told you
that I was about to change your life.
Oh, boy.
what's that sound?
I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
Yes.
I don't know what to say.
Oh, say nothing.
you will learn to love me.
okay! Hold on.
you gotta let the cookies cool
before you pop 'em in your mouth.
why don't you guys get to know each other?
maybe have lunch together.
Erin, would you have lunch with me?
okay. - Good!
Yes!
Michael, can I talk to you privately?
sure. Kevin, please leave.
Bye. - Good-bye.
I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin,
but I'm not...I like andy.
okay. This is going to kill Kevin.
I'm sure he'll be fine. - I'm not so sure.
Kevin has an enormous heart.
literally, he has an elephant heart.
he had a transplant,
when he was 17, had some problems,
Really?
no. Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart.
but he is very sensitive, and it won't kill Erin to just go and have lunch with him in the break room
like I promised him.
I bet his heart is enlarged, though.
I don't want anyone to die.
well, just don't let him sit on you.
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
you'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good.
there he is.
go to him.
Hey, she touched my shoulder.
Hey, guys, we're short on rooms,
so this is Dale and Kathy.
Hi. - Hi. Sorry.
Hi. So sorry.
Oh...Careful.
she just shoves the nipple right in there.
I know.
did you see that?
I'm pretty sure she's...
did you grow up around here?
no.
so...
you must have grown up around somewhere else?
Yes.
why was I hiding behind the plant?
well, in college, I took a botany class,
and there was lots of drama in that class.
uh, kids would gossip about me,
so I would eavesdrop on them
by hiding behind different plants
in the botany class.
and then they would say things like, "oh, this guy's gonna fail this class,
or, what's this guy doing"
spying on us from behind plants?
and then I would jump out at them and confront them
and be like,"oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants
and spy on people?" busted.
Oh...the reason?
the reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation
was that I thought that Erin and Kevin
were kind of hitting it off, and...
I was jealous.
uh, hi. Pam Halpert.
Yes. - Hi. I'm Clarke.
Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant.
Yep.
Yeah, that would be great.
Yeah, that would be really great.
okay. - When's she available?
actually, uh, I'm the consultant.
got milk?
all right, uh...
let's see what we're workin' with.
so, uh, the biggest thing...
besides not being able to get her to latch...
here, I'll get that for you. - Oh, thank you.
is that, um, I can't tell if I'm really producing.
I-I don't know if she's getting anything.
let me feel here. - Okay.
Yeah, it's quite full.
why don't you put your hand on top of my hand?
okay. - When you're feeding,
you want to press in like this, make your hand in a "c."
does that hurt? - No, I mean, - It feels...Pressure. - Sure it doesn't hurt?
no. It just feels like pressure.
see how I'm flicking the nipple? Like that.
Yep. - You can stimulate it.
all right, so you just wanna do that, and that will, uh...
perfect.
the baby should grab onto that.
I think she will. - Okay.
so I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though.
we'll figure it out... Probably.
why don't you bring your baby over here?
okay.
she's beautiful.
Oh, thank you. - Yes. Congratulations.
thank you.
well, you're doing a good job.
just stay relaxed, and...
I'll come back in a bit to check on you, okay?
okay. - Please do.
Oh, shoot. - What?
shoot. She fell off.
Oh. Uh, try...try the torpedo thing.
will you just...will you grab Clarke real quick?
no need. I saw him do it.
I can try it. - Jim, please, please, please.
I think it would be weird if you did it.
that makes sense.
I'll just... Go get the other guy.
Hey, what's up, kid?
have you had a chance to look over the revisions
on the contract I prepared for you?
nothing left to do except dot the "I"s,
the "j"s, and the umlauts.
why don't you meet me here
at exactly mid-late afternoon?
I look forward to it.
very well. - Good-bye.
Jim, get her.
get the baby.
get her, come on.
okay. I know, I know.
okay.
thank you. Okay.
come here.
Oh, boy.
all right. - I got her.
okay.
okay.
okay.
she latched. She latched.
that's amazing. - Oh, my god.
I didn't even have to do the "c" thing.
that's awesome. - Oh, we're doing it.
that's great.
we're really parents now.
Kevin, Erin would like a few words with you.
Hey. - Hi.
I have really enjoyed our time together.
Yeah. Me too.
I wanna continue workingon our friendship... - It's been really, really fun.
because I think a friendship Could be a really cool thing.
Yeah, me too.
and you're my friend. I hope that I'm your friend.
Yeah. - Oh, my god, this is agoning.
do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
you said she liked me.
okay, even if someone told you that,
you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.
and I'm surprised
that you didn't question me in the first place.
I've done better than Erin. - No, you haven't.
Lynn was way hotter than erin, michael.
Lynn was as hot as erin.
Yeah, Michael, but you dated holly and jan,
and they were so much hotter than you.
this isn't about me, and that is debatable.
and I have a personality, whereas you...
Yes, andy?
nice going.
knock, knock.
Oh, hey, Isabel.
Hey.
Pam, she's gorgeous.
Oh, my...can I hold her?
Yes, yes.
she was a little fussy earlier,
but she's totally quieted down.
here, let me just, uh... let me burp her.
I don't want her to spit up on you.
look at you. - Come here, sweetie.
Oh, my god! - What?
wrong baby. - What?
wrong baby! This is not our baby!
Oh, my god!
okay, okay. - Oh, my gosh.
has she been fussing long?
no. Not at all. - Perfect.
I was out like a light.
she's not hungry.
how's it going? - Well...
I feel like she needs to eat, but she just won't latch on,
which is weird, because the other baby did it...
bottles are fine.
a lot of babies grow up using bottles.
so you excited to take your baby home?
we definitely are. At 3: 00, right?
you said we could stay till 3: 00?
Yeah, you can. - Okay.
but it's 2: 35.
half hour. - Well, 25 minutes.
and you're all set with the car seat?
Yes. Car seat's right there.
that bottom part needs to go in the car.
Newsflash...the whole thing needs to go in the car.
I'll be back in 25 minutes.
or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be.
can we get a late checkout?
I don't... I don't think she heard me.
Hello?
Dwight? What...
what are you doing here?
Isabel. Hello.
Yeah, the, uh...
kitchen was disgusting, so...
new cabinets. - Yeah.
all I did was bring macaroni and cheese.
Where's the fridge?
Oh, it's... In the backyard.
I'll take this.
well, I'll let you get back to it.
Hey, listen, I know that I'm an adult,
but maybe I could come by some time for a teeth cleaning,
you know, just for fun.
well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist too.
are they, now?
how some people spend their money.
right?
Yeah.
all right. I'll call you, kid.
do that.
you really sure we should be leaving?
Yeah.
but you hear the baby crying, right?
Where's your car?
uh, it's in the lot.
a lot of fathers bring the car around.
right. Okay. Yes.
that'd be... A smart thing to do.
uh, Pam, I will be right back.
okay. Please hurry.
Erin, uh...
I need you to send this fax immediately.
it's really important,
so I'm gonna stand here and wait for the confirmation.
okay. Good.
the fax says...
Erin, will you have dinner with me?
from andy.
and the number is our office fax number.
it's busy.
why don't I keep trying,
and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
well, sorry. That's unacceptable.
I need you to send it immediately,
or you're fired.
you can't talk to me like that.
I didn't do anything wrong.
I've been having a tough day, and it...it's just...
Oh, god, no.
I'm...
just read the fax.
you read the fax!
I'm...
I'm asking you out.
Oh, my god.
that's amazing.
let me just fax this,
and I'll check my planner.
so it's a date. - Yes.
do you have a day in mind? - Yeah, what day?
what day? - Every day's fine. Or...
well, what's that one? - Thursday?
okay. Let's do it. - Okay!
would you like me to help you up out of the chair?
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Yeah, no, I got it.
just got a lot of discharges today.
okay.
okay. All right, thanks.
all right, thanks. - All right.
you wanna eat?
let'S...you wanna try eating?
okay.
okay. Come on.
just you and me.
it's just you and me. Come on.
ready? Here we go.
Yeah!
Oh, yeah!
like that.
Oh, there we go.
you got it!
there were five tickets on the windshield.
Hey. - Hi.
we did it.
you used my move, didn't you?
I used a variation of your move.
there is no greater feeling
than when two people who are perfect for each other
overcome all obstacles and find true love.
and that's what I thought
that Erin and Kevin were gonna find today.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
two forms of I. D.please.
and now you... two forms of I. D.please.
all right, all is in order.
I just need your signature.
what is it?
nothing.
all right.
how would you like to celebrate?
just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.
I feel sick.
What...?
I couldn't find your ipod.
just give me a couple days...
be out of your hair.
OK, well
I did not get the job in New York.
but I got the real prize...
domestic bliss.
jan made me breakfast this morning.
well, she bought the milk.
it's soy.
this is why I do it.
that's what I have to come home to.
she probably won't be up for a few hours.
this is going be a very good year.
very good.
jan is at home.
Jim is back.
good stuff.
Andy and Dwight are rocking the sales team.
I feel very blessed.
what was the exact offer?
it was for a... Video.
Yeah, well, what kd of video?
a celebrity sex tape.
Really? What kind of celebrity?
not relevant. - How much you pay for it?
not relevant. - you paid for it?
it all happened so fast.
I broke up with Karen after the job interview.
and, uh...
it was a little awkward when she came back from the city.
she told me very clearly that just because we were broken up didn't mean that she was going anywhere, because she had worked really hard for her career.
but the next day, her desk was empty.
and as for me and my current romantic life...
I, uh...
I'm single now and looking.
so if you know anybody...
Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York.
I talked him through his breakup.
it's really nice to be good friends again.
are you kidding me?
Pam and Jim are totally hooking up.
all they do is smile.
they're just keeping it a secret.
right?
I don't know.
there is no evidence of intimacy.
they've been in remarkably good moods.
could other things.
are you kidding me?
and Sunday,
I'm thinking of going to that flea market at the drive-in.
Oh, that sounds fun.
I'm mountain biking on Sunday in, uh...
montage Mountain.
cool. - yeah.
well, have fun with that.
ladies and gentlemen.
I have some bad news.
Meredith was hit by a car.
what? - where?
it happened this morning in the parking lot.
I took her to the hospital.
and the doctors tried to save her life.
they did the best that they could.
and she is going to be okay.
what is wrong with you?
why did you have to phrase it like that?
so she's really going to be fine?
Yes.
she has a slight...
Pelvical fracture.
but, uh, people have survived far worse.
thank god you were there.
Yeah.
did you see who did it?
Oh, no need. We can just check the security tapes.
Yeah, kind of a good news/bad news there.
I was able to be on the scene so quickly, because I was in the car that hit her.
who was driving?
Oh, Michael.
one day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway.
I wonder who he ran over then.
it's only Meredith.
Yeah, it's only Meredith. Thank god.
but did you see the way they looked at me?
like I was a murderer or something.
Hey.
why did you do it?
it was an accident.
was she talking back? - no.
just got sick of that face?
did she owe you money?
is this down sizing?
did she spurn your advances?
Hey, guys.
we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch.
and we're kicking in $5 for flowers.
who's we? you and Jim?
no, me and Stanley and Phyllis so far.
Oh. I bet Jim goes too.
Yeah, I haven't asked him yet.
Oh. I bet you ask.
I was planning on it.
I bet you were.
Angela? - Subtle.
what? - Are you coming?
I can't. Sprinkles is sick.
she's been sick for some time. thank you for asking.
no one asks about sprinkles.
I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her.
and who will she eat lunch with?
can't your other cats keep her company?
there's bad blood.
jealousies, cliques. - Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee.
I shouldn't even be planning this.
it's your job.
all right!
my lord, my liege. - Yes, Michael?
so Ryan got promoted to corporate where he is a little fish in a big pond.
whereas back here in Scranton,
I am still top dog in a fairly large pond.
so who's the real boss?
the dog or a fish?
so I need a little treat for the gang.
something to win their affections back.
back?
why is that, Michael?
well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
Oh!
did you do this on purpose?
no, I was being negligent.
but she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely.
tiny little crack in her pelvis.
but she will be... - Did this happen on company property?
Yes.
it was on company property with company property.
so double jeopardy. we are fine.
I don't... I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
Oh, right, I'm sorry.
what is "we're fine"?
people keep calling me a "wunderkind."
I don't even know what that means.
I mean, I know what it means.
it means very successful for your age.
so I guess it makes sense, but...
it's a weird word.
Hey, D.
hey monkey, what's up?
can you do me a little favor?
go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine?
sure.
I have to visit the alkie.
check to see if she's faking.
if a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis.
you know what?
I bet she cracked it at home.
jumped in front of the car to get some worker's comp.
I wouldn't put it past her.
so what do you need me to do?
I wrote it out.
there's a diabetes shot.
roll the insulin in your hands, don't shake it.
she gets an ace inhibitor with her meal.
but you have to put her right in front of the dish, or she won't see it because of the cataracts.
mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine.
and you wanna give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten.
and, oh... There's a fungal cream, because she has this infection under her tail.
so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
okay, I have an announcement.
you pushed Darryl out the window? - No.
you shot Dwight? - no. No, that is not funny. I love my employees.
even though I hit one of you with my car.
for which I take full responsibility.
look, I am just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy and on to more positive things.
so I thought we should plant a tree.
Oh, good. That means we don't have to work.
okay, we're leaving for the hospital at 1: 00.
so, like, a freedom tree.
I can take three people.
I can also take three people.
separate cars. - Pam?
all right, we'll get a card at the hospital, and we'll sign it outside her room.
sales people can go later in the day.
hourly workers can go at lunch.
okay, good, good.
so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.
excellent. - I- I was inking that...
good work, Pam.
but if you...
Yaaaay, Pam!
all right, since I'm the boss, I will drive as well.
who wants shgun?
you can't be serious.
you ran a woman over this morning.
everybody inside the car was fine, Stanley!
guess what? I have flaws.
what are they?
Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower.
sometimes I spend too much time volunteering.
occasionally, I'll hit somebody with my car.
so sue me.
no, don't sue me.
that's the opposite of the point that I am trying to make.
I hate hospitals.
in my mind, they are associated with sickness.
Oh...
she looks like an angel.
she looks awful.
no... Okay.
she always looks like that it was not my fault.
I think she's awake.
no.
she's in a coma.
no.
okay.
I brought all your friends from the office, dear.
at the same time. - yep.
Hello, Meredith.
this is weird.
brought you some balloons.
why don't we...here you go.
tie these up, cheer up your tubes.
Oh, for god's sake.
nurse!
no, don't bother the nurse. Just put it back in.
I am going to be sick.
I am going to puke. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't worry about it. don't touch it.
what are you doing? - just gimme that thanks.
does it hurt terribly?
no, it's not too bad.
they have me on a lot of painkillers.
Oh, really? what kind? Codeine?
vicodin? Percocet?
fentanyl? Oxycontin?
Palladone? what? - I have no idea.
well, it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time.
I'll see you guys at the office.
okay, wait up, wait up, guys. Guys, guys, hold on a sec.
you know what I was thinking might be sort of fun?
is if you forgave me... in front of everybody.
Michael, I'm not gonna do that.
cause you know what they say in the bible about forgiveness?
forgiveness...
is next to godliness.
no, that's not. that's cleanliness. - Well, just shh. just... Just...
you cracked my pelvis.
look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
you're not forgiven.
come on.
do I need to be liked? Absolutely not.
I like to be liked.
I enjoy being liked.
I have to be liked.
but it's not, like this compulsive need to be liked.
like my need to be praised.
Hey. - hey, monkey.
any problems?
well, you left the tv on.
and your cat is dead.
What?!
sparkles, the white one, is dead.
that was the sick one, right?
but I thought she had more time.
no.
did she look...
when you saw her, how was she looking?
really dead.
like
like a, just a dead cat.
so... hey, come on.
don't be sad. just...
okay? just...
she's in a better place.
all right.
actually, the place that she's in is the freezer.
because of the odor.
it's gonna be okay.
okay, you know what?
everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing.
she cracked her pelvis. A tiny, little crack.
and she's gonna be fine.
so let just...
Michael, Angela's cat died.
I'm sorry, Angela.
man, what a day, huh?
how could it get any worse?
her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then...
God!
that's three things.
I'll tell you what's going on.
this office is cursed.
and we need to do something about it.
I am taking responsibility.
and it is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car.
I'm not superstitious, but...
I'm... I am a little superstitious.
we do anything involving an Indian burial ground?
like what?
like park on it.
or dig up a body.
do you have anything you wanna tell us?
no, I did not violate an Indian burial ground.
in fact, I had some good luck recently.
Alfredo's pizza picked my business card out of the basket, so I get a week of free pies.
that's cool. - Yeah.
perfect.
so our tragedy is our good luck.
Satan.
sprinkles never hurt a soul.
God, in your infinite wisdom, how can you do this?
she wasn't ready.
she had so much left to accomplish.
it is only a cat.
you never...
you don't like them.
Dwight, please.
Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?
no, I have not.
well, I think you should go to the hospital and pay your respects.
I do not respect her.
but I will go.
all right.
I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
Oh, Michael, you can ask about religious beliefs.
Satan is a master of lies.
everything he says is the opposite.
all right, well, then you can ask about religious beliefs.
thank you for the permission. psych!
all right, let's just go around the room, and... And tell me what you believe in.
um, catholic. - okay.
Presbyterian.
Oh, me too.
for real? - Same religion.
all right. - Cool.
uh, I'm a Lutheran, and Bob is a Unitarian.
it keeps things spicy.
that's why we're cursed.
I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower.
you have more fun as a follower.
but you make more money as a leader.
Kelly, you are Hindu.
so you believe in Buddha.
that's Buddhists.
are you sure?
no.
what are you?
uh, well, if you're gonna reduce my identity to my religion, then I'm Sikh.
but I also like hip-hop and NPR.
and I'm restoring a 1967 corvette in my spare time.
okay.
so one Sikh, and...
as a farmer,
I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery.
with the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive, we could power a small fan for two days.
you tell me what's unethical.
blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
don't pull any plugs.
how are you doing, Miss Palmer?
better. Excellent.
are you a doctor or a male nurse?
um, I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor.
her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy, but she did, or at least, she got time off for one.
so that is where her uterus went.
miss Palmer, your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago?
Yes.
just doing my job.
it also says you were recently bitten by a raccoon?
and a rat.
separate occasions.
spend your whole le trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car.
and it's not even one of the popular ones.
everybody gets on your case.
doesn't make any sense.
God is dead.
if there was a god, then Ryan and I would be married by now.
maybe believing in god was a mistake.
what did people believe in before?
the sun?
maybe there's some sort of animal that we could make a sacrifice to.
like.
a giant buffalo.
or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion.
or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat.
or just...
the head of a monkey with...
the antlers of a reindeer.
with the body of...
a porcupine.
I will do some research.
okay. - I can help you with that.
so just to be safe, they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
God, rabies?
I was in the hospital room with her.
how contagious is that? is that like an STD?
no, no. You gotta be bitten by something.
this place is so cursed.
actually, the doctor said it was lucky she came in the hospital, 'cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in.
lockjaw.
I know a lot of you are very upset with me
but it may make you feel a little bit better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life by putting a garbage bag over her head and it had a bat in it.
six of one, really.
turns out, Meredith has been exposed to rabies.
thanks to me, she went to the hospital, and that saved her life.
curse is broken.
curse is broken, people!
Oh, there is a god!
and he has a plan for us after all.
so go home, get some rest.
very, very good work today.
got a lot accomplished.
is there a god?
if not, what are all these churches for?
and who is Jesus' dad?
Oh, well.
if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be.
I thought they'd be good together.
like PB &J.
Pam Beesly and Jim.
what a waste.
what a waste.
I told you I'm not dating anyone.
and even if I was,
I don't think it's anyone's business.
I mean, when I do fall in love, like, when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it to is a camera crew or my coworkers.
almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever wanna be.
trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.
michael Scott's Dunder Mifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer memorial celebrity rabies awareness fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
pro-am.
pro-am race for the...
they hung up. - okay a woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car to learn that she may have rabies.
but that is where we are in America.
and that does not sit right with me.
and that is why I am hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies...
to raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies.
a disease that has been largely eradicated in the U. S.
but not very many people know that.
no, rabies.
babies would be a good idea.
can I put you down for a dime?
Hi, Stankley, how many sponsors so far?
zero.
come on, man.
you gotta step it up.
it's for a good cause.
jan called this morning and pledged $500.
isn't that your money?
that is for a good cause.
Phyllis, how is the rabies quilt coming?
Oh, it's coming.
Oh, look at that!
three way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
Michael? - Yes?
you cannot make me run. - Okay.
it is not a real charity.
it's stupid, Michael.
and I'm not gonna do it. - All right.
you didn't run for me when I thought I had skin cancer.
I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
no.
okay.
well, back in olden times, a large, fat person like this was a person of power.
a person who had money, who could buy food.
a person of respect, like the regional manager of the day.
whereas someone athletic and trim like myself was somebody who worked in the fields, and I was a peasant.
I just don't wanna run.
I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
well, you're going to have to run or you're gonna be in a lot of trouble.
it is not old times anymore.
I'm petrified of nipple chafing.
once it starts, is a vicious circle.
you have sensitive nipples, they chafe.
so they become more sensitive.
so they chafe more.
so...
I take precautions. Hey, Angela.
Hey, um...
I'm sorry about your cat.
this is Sprinkles.
she was my best friend.
I kept her going through countless ailments.
I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased.
this is Halloween last year.
just a couple of kittens out on the town.
I'm having relationship problems.
and since you're always having relationship problems,
I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
what's wrong?
I have this crazy thought that I know is crazy.
that maybe Dwight killed my cat.
when I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her.
but all my bags of frozen French Fries had been clawed to shreds!
Oh.
something's not right.
the vet's doing an autopsy.
Angela, I'm sorry.
did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
I'm more of a dog person.
so what's your strategy for this race?
well, I'm gonna start fast.
then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
what? - Then'm gonna end fast.
why won't more people do that?
cause they're stupid.
what?
Oh, um, no, that's not...
I mean, that wasn't...
Yeah, that was, um...
I mean, I can see how it would seem a bit like we, uh...
how it looks like, um...
but, I mean, nowadays, you can edit anything, right?
I mean, you can edit anything to...
look like, um, anything.
so. Yeah, I gave him a ride home.
because... right.
we're dating.
Wow.
there it is.
uh, yeah.
we haven't told anybody.
but it's going really great.
right?
it is going really great
shut up.
you're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
Oh, really?
you'll feel better after the 5k.
exercise is good for depression.
I am not depressed.
I'm in grief!
we have raised almost $700, most of it from me and Jan.
um... When do they put that on the giant check?
or is that something that we write in lat?
well, a giant check costs about $200 to make up.
I have a print shop standing by, but...
what do you think, Michael?
that's over 25% of our funds.
it's... A tough decision.
um...
I always imagined it with a giant check.
Yeah, I mean, I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
giant check it is.
well, I don't know.
on the other hand, it does leave less money for bat birth control.
bat birth control.
wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right, Michael?
that's what you told me when I contributed.
you don't contribute very much.
I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor.
how's that going?
not well.
a doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700 or $500 if we go with the giant check.
which we are.
and also...
there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
how about a rabies nurse?
I don't think so. you know what, though?
I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour.
for, uh, parties and bachelor events.
that's possible. Look into that.
great. It's gonna cost a couple hundred bucks.
and, uh... oh, actually, more...
with tips.
maybe we should skip the ceremony and just set up a college fund for Meredith's son.
have you met that kid?
not going to college.
5K means five kilometers, not 5, 000 miles.
come I hey. hey, hey!
Oh, my god! what are you doing?
what are you doing?!
you said, "come in!" No, I didn't. Just...
Oh, my god.
please, get out.
still burned in my eyes.
I can imagine.
come in.
may I enter the room?
Yes. or "come in."
see how I did that?
that's the way you should enter a room.
you knock and then you wait for the all clear.
you couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room? Yes.
but I have an office, so why would I do that?
on average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office?
just ballpark.
european offices are naked all the time.
they're so not.
besides, my shirt tail covered most of it, so...
I didn't see where it started, but I saw where it ended.
phew, gross.
that's not gross! it is the human body.
what is your problem?
Pam, you're an artist, right?
think of me as one of your models.
okay, you know what?
I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today.
it's not fair to people with rabies.
and that's the point. right?
okay.
let's go have some fun all right.
they say if you're nervous around someone, you should picture them naked.
I do not recommend this strategy.
try picturing them with more clothes on.
or a funny coat.
Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office?
and not a French beach?
okay, name, ease?
you're over 75 years old?
82 November 1st.
how much is the prize money?
there's no prize money.
well, is any of this real?
check that out.
look at me, I'm Toby!
I'm stretching. I know what l'm doing.
so I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
what? no, it was not...
look, I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, okay?
so hands off.
okay, everybody, listen up!
thank you for coming.
before we get started, I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies.
and I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies.
that should scare you.
it scares me.
you people need to educate yourselves.
three Americans every year die from rabies.
four Americans every year die from rabies.
how many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies?
show of hands.
one, two, three... too many to count.
it is truly the silent killer.
no, it is the foaming, barking killer.
and it is something that... rryl!
what are you doing?
I'm giving him a peanut.
no, don't give him...
did you hear anything I said?
look how happy he is.
he's happy because he's insane.
you know what?
that's a perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate.
Where's the nurse?
this is the reason we're here.
Hello, Michael.
Oh, hey, I know you. Elizabeth, right? Yeah.
Wow.
very cool you went back and got your degree.
I would like you to accept this check for $340
made out to science.
make sure that that gets into the right hands.
right.
you got it?
Mm-hmm.
okay.
fettuccine Alfredo.
time to carbo load.
Mmm.
just remember, folks, it's not about winning.
it is about finishing.
on your marks!
get set!
down!
on your left!
wow, you're fast.
you're doing great, Michael. look at you go!
that's my boss!
Yeah, baby!
I'm fast. I'm very fast.
I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot oh, yes, I will work out today.
I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
I've walked two marathons.
pretty sure I can handle a 5k.
the key is drafting to eliminate wind resistance.
Oh, we're in last place.
Oh, would you look at that?
damn it.
water!
water.
Oh! water, babe?
no, no water for me.
not while rabies causes fear of water.
solidarity!
Michael, that's irrational!
rabies victims...
have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives.
so... Least I could do.
Oh, god. my nipples.
it's starting.
can we get another round?
okay. thanks so we've got what? another 20 minutes?
more or less. mmm.
that fettuccini...
is hitting my stomach like a rock.
you got nothing to worry about.
Excellent!
wait, imodium or ex-lax?
I'm making great time.
usually I have to take a bathroom break halfway through a race like this.
but... Not today.
Ooh, an estate sale.
want to go in?
I don't know, I'm really committed to winning.
okay, but what if I told you that all the money you spend here goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
Mmm, yes.
that's what I thought.
Yeah. right?
let's do some good.
you have reached the offices of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.
rabies awarness pro am fun run race...
for the cure.
leave a message.
Oh, god.
Oh, Alfredo sauce.
I'm getting a stitch. ahh!
Ow! god!
watch the nipples, Kevin!
back off me.
how you feeling? better?
no.
well, you look cute as button.
you've worked up quite a sweat.
the vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
I am a farmer, Angela.
what does that mean?
okay, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what it is folk don't have the stomach to do.
you did kill her!
I-I sang her the favorite songs.
you put her in my freezer!
it was beautiful and gentle and respectful.
I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
well, then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
well, I'm not responsible that... Hey!
Ow! it's okay!
it's nothing! I'm robbing her!
it's nothing! it's fine!
how could you do that without telling me?
I thought I was helping you.
I expected a hug.
I took care of that cat the best way I knew how.
cat heaven is a beautiful place.
but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
I know a great taxidermist.
I'll pay to have her stuff.
well, he's not great, but he's pretty good.
you don't understand.
take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.
or we can have her buried out at the east field by mother.
huh, Angela?
don't touch me, Dwight.
it's kind of designy and cool.
it was $8.
Oh, and I get to carry it.
and the winner is Toby Flenderson!
have a seat. I'll write it down.
where are we?
I don't know.
like five kilometers from the office.
he couldn't have made it circle?
I am not going to finish.
can't beat rabies.
nobody can beat rabies.
rabies has been around for a thousand years.
I was fool to think that I could beat it.
pictures of the dog all around.
Yeah, probably... hey.
what are you doing here?
did you come back for us of...
I can't finish.
I feel so weak. I just...
well, you're probably dehydrated.
what do you want me to do, Jim?
a glass of water would be a start.
no, there are people all over t world with all sorts of problems and afflictions and diseases.
they're deformed and they're abnormal.
and... they're illiterate and ugly.
symphonies don't have any money.
public tv is bust.
I can't do anything about it.
I can't, you know...
there's just one of me, and there's thousand of them.
and rabies wins.
wow, you are a downer.
we were having a pretty nice day.
I'm still having a nice day.
you are? yeah.
Hey, Michael, look at this lamp.
8
that's a good deal.
and Michael, you don't have rabies.
and chances are you're not gonna get it anytime soon.
so you don't really have to think about it too much.
Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
Yeah, but there's other better people out there who are helping.
you just don't think I am capable of making a difference.
I know you, Michael.
I saw you naked.
you don't...
you don't know me.
you've just seen my penis.
I can make a difference remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car.
and I owe it to her to finish this g. D. 5k.
Oh!
no, no!
finishing that 5k was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.
I ate more Fettuccine Alfredo and drank less water than I have in my entire life.
people always talk about triumphs of the human spirit.
well, today I had a triumph of the human body.
that's why everybody was applauding for me at the end.
my guts and my heart.
and while I eventually puked my guts out,
I never puked my heart out.
and I'm very, very proud of that.
Hey, Michael. Hey, Mer.
how you doing?
better.
it's ironic, isn't it?
I mean, I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water.
and you're in it for a disease that causes a fear of water.
I'm in because you hit me with your car.
Oh. but I want to say...
I heard you were trying really hard, so... I'm not mad at you anymore.
Thanks.
I'm not mad at you anymore.
want to share?
sure.
I'm not really sick.
I'm GOOD.
Hey!
Hey! - I GOT YOU ONE - O WOW THANK YOU - YEAH
I WAS GONNA GRAB SOME CHIPS YOU WANT SOME?
no THANKS
we ARE STILL HAVING LUNCH TOGETHER RIGHT?
I GUESS
how DARE YOU?
Hey, TOBY?
what's THIS?
I JUST WANNA REMIND EVERYONE
about THE COMPANY RULES INVOLVING PDA,
or PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF AFFECTION.
Yes, SOME PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE HAVE COMPLAINED.
Oh, REALLY.
about SOME OTHER PEOPLE ENGAGING IN PDA.
and, YOU KNOW,
is THIS ABOUT ME AND JAN IN MY OFFICE?
because I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT THAT WAS CONSENSUAL.
what WE DID HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU OR ANYONE HERE.
I DON'T THINK ANYONE HEARD ANYTHING.
we WERE VERY DISCREET.
and--and MOST PEOPLE HAD LEFT BY THAT POINT.
so I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.
what I THINK YOU SHOULD DO,
is ROLL UP THE MEMO REAL TIGHT...
okay, LOOK, THE MEMO WAS NOT ABOUT YOU.
for THE RECORD, I HAVE NEVER BEEN INVOLVED WITH ANYONE AT WORK IN ANY CAPACITY.
all RIGHT, EVERYONE, LOOK.
all RIGHT, THE COMPLAINT WAS ABOUT JIM AND PAM.
so...
no WAY.
what?
you GUYS ARE TOGETHER?
um...
Yep.
Yes, WE ARE.
Whoa! WOW!
tuna!
I KNEW IT! AWESOME!
to THE TWO OF YOU.
Yes! YES!
Toby, WAS THIS YOUR FUN LITTLE WAY OF CONGRATULATING US?
Yes.
okay.
mind IS EXPLODING.
get OVER HERE. COME ON.
come HERE.
okay. OKAY, STAND UP.
here WE GO.
everyone, THIS IS A DAY THAT WILL LIVE IN INFAMY.
because TODAY...
is THE DAY...
that JIM AND PAM BECOME ONE.
actually, WE'VE BEEN DATING FOR A COUPLE MONTHS.
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH.
phone's RINGING.
no, NO, NO. PAM, LET 'EM RING.
let THE BELLS OF DUNDER MIFFLIN
chime OUT YOUR LOVE.
because...
this IS REALLY GOOD.
my HEART SOARS WITH THE EAGLE'S NEST.
I DON'T SEE IT.
I THINK THEY BOTH COULD DO BETTER.
it's NOT A SURPRISE TO ME.
Pam IS THE OFFICE MATTRESS.
Jim HALPERT'S OFF THE MARKET.
guess WHO JUST BECAME THE BEST LOOKING SINGLE GUY IN THE OFFICE?
Hey, CAN YOU MAKE THAT STRAIGHTER?
that's WHAT SHE SAID.
did YOU PLAN THAT?
no.
can YOU MAKE THAT STRAIGHTER?
that JOB LOOKS HARD.
you SHOULD PUT YOUR MOUTH ON THAT.
how CAN YOU EVEN USE THAT ONE NATURALLY?
blowing UP BALLOONS, I THOUGHT.
you MIGHT WANNA TRIM IT A LITTLE?
Michael. OH, IS RYAN COMING BACK TODAY?
Yeah, HE IS.
Oh.
Pam AND JIM ARE TOGETHER.
Ryan IS VISITING.
only THING THAT COULD MAKE THIS DAY BETTER
is ICE CREAM.
what DO YOU WANT?
to GIVE YOU THIS.
what IS THAT?
it's A FERAL BARN CAT.
I TRAPPED HIM LAST NIGHT AND I'M GIVING HIM TO YOU
as A REPLACEMENT CAT FOR THE ONE I DESTROYED.
her NAME WAS SPRINKLES.
and HIS NAME IS GARBAGE.
mose CALLS HIM GARBAGE 'CAUSE HE LIKES TO EAT GARBAGE.
don't YOU, GARBAGE?
ar AR AR AR!
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST THOUGHT YOU COULD REPLACE SPRINKLES.
before SHE'S EVEN IN THE GROUND.
you HAVEN'T BURIED HER YET?
don't RUSH ME. I'M GRIEVING.
garbage CAN BE VERY HELPFUL, OKAY?
he's A USEFUL CAT.
he KILLED AN ENTIRE FAMILY OF RACCOONS.
look AT HIM.
I DON'T WANT GARBAGE.
I WANT SPRINKLES.
Hey, TOBY.
Hey, PAM...
you TWO.
Hey.
so NOW THAT WE ARE DATING,
uh, WE JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF WE HAD TO SIGN ONE OF THOSE "WE'RE DATING" THINGS FOR THE COMPANY.
Oh, WELL, YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE ONLY FOR,
you KNOW, RELATIONSHIPS.
so IF IT'S JUST A CASUAL THING,
there's NO NEED, REALLY.
Oh.
well, I DON'T WANNA SPEAK FOR JIM,
but IT'S, LIKE, PRETTY OFFICIAL.
Uh-huh.
sorry, SO DO WE NEED TO... SIGN ONE, OR...
let's JUST WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS, YOU KNOW.
what?
well, LET'S JUST WAIT.
Oh, OKAY. OKAY.
great. YEAH.
Hey, RYAN. HOLD ON ONE SEC.
welcome BA...
Hey, PAM. IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.
is MICHAEL IN?
Hey, THERE HE IS! YEAH.
there HE IS!
he's BACK! AND HE'S WITH A BEARD.
he HAS FACIAL HAIR.
look AT HIM!
all GROWN UP AND NO PLACE TO GO.
Hello, MR. SONNY CROCKET. I'M TUBBS.
okay. SHOULD WE GET STARTED?
Oh, YEAH, LET'S GET STARTED BECAUSE, UH, YES.
cause THIS IS VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS.
Yeah, EXACTLY.
this IS A BUSINESS MEETING.
fire GUY!
Ah! STOP THAT!
that's RIGHT! THAT'S RIGHT!
fire GUY--DON'T START ANY FIRES, RYAN.
fire GUY!
you WEREN'T HERE FOR THAT.
here FOR WHAT?
when HE STARTED THE FIRE. LOOK HOW BIG HE IS.
look AT YOU.
you ARE SO MATURE AND OLD AND LITTLE MAN NOW.
you're LIKE OUR LITTLE MAN.
okay. LITTLE OLD MAN BOY.
Michael, EVERYBODY...
bearded MAN BOY.
let ME SAY SOMETHING.
I KNOW I USED TO BE A TEMP HERE,
but NOW EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT.
Yeah. I'D LIKE YOUR RESPECT.
I AM YOUR BOSS NOW.
you're GONNA HAVE TO TREAT ME THE SAME WAY YOU TREATED JAN.
Oh, WOW. SO...
that's A LITTLE KINKY.
I DON'T SWING THAT WAY. OKAY.
hoo!
I THINK RYAN HAS A GAY CRUSH ON ME.
enough, OKAY! THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE.
and IT STOPS RIGHT NOW.
do YOU UNDERSTAND?
Yes.
everybody, COME ON. SETTLE DOWN.
let's GET SERIOUS HERE.
um, RYAN HAS A VERY SPECIAL IMPORTANT PRESENTATION TO DO.
which WE WILL BE DOING IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM IN TEN MINUTES.
perfect. SOUND GOOD?
okay. ALL RIGHT.
Yeah, RYAN SNAPPED AT ME.
but THERE WAS THIS TWINKLE IN HIS EYETHAT I PICKED UP ON WHICH SAID, "DUDE, WE'RE FRIENDS.
I'm DOING THIS FOR APPEARANCES.
I AM THE BIG BOSS NOW.
and I HAVE TO SEEM LIKE AN OGRE.
but YOU KNOW ME AND YOU TRUST ME.
and WE LIKE EACH OTHER.
and WE'LL ALWAYS BE FRIENDS.
and I WOULD NEVER TAKE YOU FOR GRANTED IN A MILLION YEARS.
and I MISS YOU, MAN. AND I LOVE YOU."
his WORDS.
represents A FLOOR TO CEILING STREAMLINING OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL.
the CENTERPIECE OF THE CAMPAIGN
is A NEW BUSINESS TO BUSINESS WEBSITE INTERFACE
that WILL ALLOW US TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH BIG BOX CHAINS.
wait A SECOND.
last TIME I CHECKED,
Dunder MIFFLIN ALREADY HAS A WEBSITE.
and QUITE FRANKLY,
I'm NOT REALLY SURE WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.
this IS A MASSIVE OVERHAUL.
we're GETTING YOUNGER.
SLEEKER.
and MORE AGILE WITH THE WAY THAT WE ADAPT TO THE MARKETPLACE.
all ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL WILL BE ISSUED BLACKBERRIES FOR COMPANY USE.
Oh! GIMME, GIMME, GIMME.
I'll STICK AROUND FOR A WHILE
to HELP YOU SET THEM UP AFTERWARDS.
any QUESTIONS?
what IF WE DON'T
wanna USE A BLACKBERRY BECAUSE THEY ARE STUPID
and POINTLESS?
this IS COMPANY-WIDE, DWIGHT.
got IT.
you SHOULD CALL IT DUNDER-MIFFLINFINITY.
you KNOW, PUSH THE WORDS TOGETHER.
any OTHER QUESTIONS?
can WE SPEAK PRIVATELY ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP?
thank YOU, EVERYBODY!
Ryan HOWARD EVERYBODY!
good JOB!
that WAS SOME FUN STUFF.
when's THE WEBSITE GO UP?
as FAST AS POSSIBLE.
we WANT TO START RE-TRAINING PEOPLE ASAP,
so WE CAN HIT THE GROUND RUNNING WITH THE NEW SYSTEM.
cool BEANS.
we're SCREWED.
who IS?
us, YOU AND ME.
the OLD TIMERS.
I AM NOT OLD. YOU ARE OLD.
you ARE, LIKE, 100.
you're OVER 40. THAT'S THE CUT-OFF.
are YOU LISTENING TO WHAT HE'S SAYING?
re-training.
new SYSTEM. YOUTH.
I'm TELLING YOU, THIS KID IS THE GRIM REAPER.
you DEAL WITH THIS,
or YOU, ME, SAMMY, PHYLLIS,
the CHICK YOU HIT WITH A CAR, WE'RE GONERS.
I SWORE I WOULDN'T TELL ANYBODY THIS, BUT...
in THE INTEREST OF...
revealing SECRETS...
Oh, MY GOD, THIS IS GONNA MAKE YOUR BRAIN EXPLODE.
um, DWIGHT AND ANGELA... DATING.
have BEEN FOR SIX MONTHS.
no. SWEAR TO GOD.
Oh, THIS IS GREAT.
I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA WAIT AND TELL YOU ON YOUR BIRTHDAY, BUT THIS IS MUCH MORE FUN.
no, THEY HAVE BEEN DATING FOR, LIKE, TWO YEARS.
since BEFORE YOUR BARBEQUE.
wait, WHAT?
you KNEW.
and YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?
you DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO ME.
fair ENOUGH.
Wow!
we SHOULD HAVE STARTED DATING, LIKE, A LONG TIME AGO.
can YOU BELIEVE THAT?
sorry, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU GUYS WERE IN HERE.
no, NO, WE'RE JUST SITTING HERE.
I COULDN'T SEE YOUR HANDS.
Oh, HEY, PAM, BY THE WAY,
it's GREAT THAT YOU'RE DATING.
but WHEN A NEW CLIENT CALLS,
you JUST HAVE TO RANDOMLY ASSIGN THEM TO A SALESPERSON.
you CAN'T BASE WHO GETS NEW CLIENTSON WHO YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH THAT WEEK.
okay?
okay. OKAY.
okay.
and...that IS WHY WE WAITED SO LONG TO TELL PEOPLE.
okay, WHAT'S UP?
Yeah, OKAY.
um, I WAS JUST...
after THE PRESENTATION, JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
that VIS-A-VIS ME IN THE OFFICE,
everything IS BUSINESS AS USUAL.
well, IT IS BUSINESS, BUT NOT AS USUAL.
Yeah, NO, I UNDERSTAND.
we're MAKING GREAT STRIDES AND WE'RE UPDATING.
but BUSINESS AS USUAL, NO?
no.
we're THROWING OUT THE ENTIRE PLAYBOOK.
we're STARTING FROM SCRATCH.
we're IMPLEMENTING A BRAND NEW SYSTEM.
good, SO WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.
no. WE'RE NOT.
Mm.
Michael, I KNOW...
exactly HOW MUCH TIME AND MANPOWER ARE WASTED IN THIS BRANCH.
this COMPANY IS GETTING YOUNGER,
faster, MORE EFFICIENT.
you NEED TO PREPARE YOURSELF.
we HAD A FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENT LIVE WITH US WHEN I WAS YOUNG.
and WE CALLED HIM MY BROTHER.
and THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT HE WAS.
um, AND THEN HE WENT HOME TO WHAT IS NOW FORMERLY YUGOSLAVIA.
taking ALL OF MY BLUE JEANS WITH HIM.
and I HAD TO SPEND THE ENTIRE WINTER IN SHORTS.
that IS WHAT RYAN IS LIKE.
a FAKE BROTHER WHO STEALS YOUR JEANS.
so... HOW ARE YOU?
awesome.
I AM DATING A LOT OF GUYS.
good. A LOT.
black GUYS, MOSTLY.
what?
wait, UH...
how DO YOU TOUCH JUST ONE OF THESE BUTTONS AT A TIME?
I DON'T KNOW.
did YOU EVEN TRY?
if THE KID WANTS TO SET MINE UP, I'LL LET HIM.
I CAN'T SEE HALF THE THINGS.
it's TOO LITTLE. USE THE PHONE.
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME THAT YOU CARE ABOUT ME.
that IS WHAT I WANT.
Kelly, I'M YOUR BOSS NOW, OKAY?
you CAN'T KEEP TALKING TO ME LIKE I'M YOUR BOYFRIEND.
Oh, BIG STRONG MAN. FANCY NEW WHATEVER.
I DON'T THINK YOU EVER CARED ABOUT ME.
I NEVER CARED ABOUT YOU?
six MONTHS AGO, KAREN FILIPPELLI SENT ME AN EMAIL ASKING ME OUT.
I SAID NO BECAUSE I WAS COMMITTED TO OUR RELATIONSHIP.
well, I HOPE YOU'RE STILL COMMITTED,
because I'M PREGNANT.
and GUESS WHAT, BUDDY? I AM KEEPING IT.
okay. OKAY.
do YOU FEEL PREPARED TO HELP ME RAISE A BABY?
I CA...
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW, OKAY?
after WORK, WE'LL GO OUT TO DINNER.
we'll TALK ABOUT IT THEN, OKAY?
we HAVE A DATE!
hello.
Hello, DWIGHT.
I've BEEN THINKING ABOUT THINGS.
and I WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU WOULD
have DINNER WITH ME TONIGHT.
Really?
Yes.
I'll MAKE A RESERVATION.
no, NO, LET ME COOK FOR YOU.
cauliflower AND NOODLES. BAKED POTATO ON THE SIDE.
I WOULD PREFER A PUBLIC PLACE.
see YOU AFTER WORK.
Hi, PAM.
Hi. IS MICHAEL IN?
in HIS OFFICE. YOU CAN GO RIGHT IN.
okay. HEY.
so, ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, I HAVE YOUR OLD JOB.
well, NOT EXACTLY... MY JOB.
I HAD A DIFFERENT TITLE.
Oh, WELL, EXCUSE ME.
same OFFICE. SAME RESPONSIBILITIES.
different SALARY.
but YOU'LL GET THERE. DON'T WORRY.
well, YOU LOOK GREAT.
thank YOU.
Scranton SUITS YOU.
best DECISION I EVER MADE.
you WERE LET GO.
you KNOW WHAT? LOVE THE BEARD.
keep IT FOREVER.
Hey.
what IS THE ACTUAL DEAL
with THESE THINGS IN TERMS OF TESTICLES?
what?
I DON'T WANNA GROW WEIRD SPERM
in CASE WE EVER WANNA HAVE KIDS.
so WHAT'S RYAN DOING HERE?
Oh.
I DON'T KNOW.
they're LAUNCHING A BIG NEW BUSINESS PLAN.
and NEW WEBSITE. BLAH BLAH BLAH.
he's BEING A REAL TWERP ABOUT IT TOO.
it's ALL ABOUT YOUTH,
and AGILITY, AND STREAMLINING.
trying TO SQUEEZE OUT THE OLDER PEOPLE.
he's SUCH A SNAKE.
Yeah.
I HOPE HE GETS HIT WITH AN AGEISM SUIT.
what IS THAT WORD?
AGEISM?
you KNOW, COMPANIES, THEY CAN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE DUE TO OLD AGE.
like, A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE TRIED TO FORCE OUT
some OF THE OLDER BRANCH MANAGERS WITH A MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE.
and THEN ED TRUCK, YOUR OLD BOSS, THREATENED US WITH A LAWSUIT.
so WE HAD TO BACK OFF.
so OLDER PEOPLE HAVE JUST AS MANY RIGHTS AS YOUNGER PEOPLE.
Yes, MICHAEL.
Yes, SIR?
everything OKAY?
everything's COOL, DUDE.
I'm 30.
well, IN NOVEMBER I'LL BE 30.
is THERE ANOTHER MEETING SCHEDULED?
I WAS GONNA DO THE BLACKBERRY TUTORIAL IN HERE.
michael TOLD US TO WAIT IN HERE.
we DON'T KNOW WHY.
Oh, MAN.
good, WE'RE ALL HERE.
we CAN GET STARTED.
Michael. HAVE A SEAT.
we're NOT DOING THIS TODAY. HAVE A SEAT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
okay, THIS IS FOR EVERYONE'S... STILL MY OFFICE, RYAN.
well, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT NEW IDEAS TODAY.
well, NEW IDEAS ARE FINE.
but THEY ARE ALSO ILLEGAL.
because THEY ARE A FORM OF AGEISM.
what? YES, I AM RIGHT.
did YOU KNOW...
that THE AGE DISCRIMINATION AND EMPLOYMENT ACT OF 1967
prohibits EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION
based ON AGE WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYEES 40 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER?
I DID.
Mm? TECHNICALLY HE'S RIGHT.
Hey, SHUT UP, TOBY.
look, WHY DO WE AS A SOCIETY HATE OLD PEOPLE SO MUCH?
because THEY'RE LAME.
No!
creed, NO, THEY ARE NOT.
in FACT, MANY CULTURES REVERE OLD PEOPLE
because OF THEIR STORYTELLING ABILITY.
like THE OLD LADY FROM TITANIC.
or THE FUNNY THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO,
like, "WHERE'S THE BEEF?"
Yeah.
why DO YOU HAVE THE BIG PICTURE UP AGAIN?
you USED THAT ALREADY WHEN YOU BURNED YOUR FOOT.
reusing THE BEN KINGSLEY TOO.
I WAS GOING TO PUT UP SOME NEW PICTURES, BUT, UM, ALL OF THE INK IN THE PRINTER WAS GONE.
Oh.
michael SCOTT? THAT IS ME!
come ON IN.
who IS THIS OLD FART?
did YOU JUST STAGGER OFF THE STREET OUT OF A BOX OR SOMETHING?
who's THIS WORTHLESS BAG OF BONES?
well, THIS GUY IS NONE OTHER THAN ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF DUNDER MIFFLIN, MR. ROBERT DUNDER.
huh?
Oh, YEAH!
Yes!
Hi, EVERYONE.
Michael, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
sure THING.
excuse ME.
we HAVE ACTUAL WORK TO DO.
fine.
then I WILL CALL DAVID WALLACE AND YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO HIM
why YOU THREW THE FOUNDER OF THE COMPANY
out ON HIS ANCIENT BUTT.
Bob, HOW OLD ARE YOU?
I'm 87.
87 YEARS YOUNG.
and STILL ACTIVE. THAT IS GREAT.
did YOU KNOW THAT BOB IS STILL A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DUNDER MIFFLIN?
well, I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A BOARD MEETING IN YEARS.
I SEND A PROXY.
Ah, STILL SENDS HIS OWN PROXY.
good FOR YOU.
I'm GOING TO LIVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
my GRANDMA SCHRUTE LIVED TO BE 101.
my GRANDPA MANNHEIM IS 103.
and STILL PUTTERING AROUND DOWN IN ARGENTINA.
I TRIED TO GO VISIT HIM ONCE,
but MY TRAVEL VISA WAS PROTESTED BY THE SHOAH FOUNDATION.
I STARTED THIS COMPANY IN 1949.
Wow.
back THEN IT WAS
an INDUSTRIAL SUPPLIER OF METAL BRACKETS, MOSTLY.
for CONSTRUCTION.
Oh, BOY.
and THEN MIFFLIN.
of COURSE, HE KILLED HIMSELF LATER.
but I KNEW MIFFLIN THROUGH THE ROTARY CLUB.
great.
he WAS...
he WAS AT DINNER WITH BEVERLY AND HER HUSBAND.
what WAS HIS NAME? UM...
from--from SOUTH JERSEY.
and HE WAS TALL.
both HE AND MIFFLIN WERE TALL GUYS.
great. THAT'S GREAT.
thank YOU FOR COMING IN.
robert DUNDER, EVERYBODY.
thank YOU.
that WAS WONDERFUL.
do YOU HAVE A RIDE?
well, I CAME HERE IN A CAB.
perfect.
well, COULD YOU GET ME ANOTHER...
excellent.
inspirational. WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?
well, WE HAVE LEARNED
that YOU CAN'T TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS.
because IT'S ILLEGAL.
and YOU WILL GO TO JAIL.
I THINK THAT I SHOULD HELP HIM GET HOME.
no, NO, DON'T HELP HIM!
he DOESN'T NEED HELP, PAM.
what A NICE GUY.
good NIGHT, GUYS.
well, TODAY WAS A FANTASTIC WASTE OF TIME.
I DISAGREE. I THINK IT WAS VERY VALUABLE.
Michael, TECHNOLOGY HELPS BUSINESS, OKAY?
you SHOULD NOT RESIST IT.
this IS THE WAY THE WORLD IS MOVING.
well, I HAPPEN TO THINK
that THE OLD WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS ARE BETTER.
and I CAN PROVE IT.
okay, I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR IDEAS.
where DO YOU WANNA GO?
I DON'T KNOW, SOME PLACE ROMANTIC AND EXPENSIVE.
Kelly, COME ON.
you KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'm FEELING KIND OF NAUSEOUS, ANYWAY.
so WE CAN JUST SKIP IT.
are YOU ENJOYING YOUR VEGETARIAN NOODLES?
very MUCH.
how IS YOUR MEAT?
dry. DELICIOUS.
I HEARD A JOKE TODAY.
Oh, THAT'S FUNNY.
Yes, IT WAS.
are YOU ENJOYING YOUR MINERAL WATER?
I CAN'T DO THIS.
what?
I CAN'T BE WITH YOU.
every TIME I LOOK IN YOUR EYES,
I SEE SPRINKLES' STIFF, LIFELESS BODY.
then DON'T LOOK IN MY EYES.
look RIGHT HERE. IT'S AN OLD SALES TRICK.
I'm SORRY.
I GAVE THIS EVERYTHING I COULD.
no, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS, MONKEY.
I WILL LEAVE YR TOOTHBRUSH ON TOP OF YOUR TIRE TOMORROW MORNING.
smell THAT.
smell THAT?
dry ROT.
no, DWIGHT.
that SMELLS LIKE GOOD BUSINESS TO ME.
what I HAVE DONE HERE,
is I HAVE COLLECTED ALL THE FINEST GOURMET ITEMS THAT SCRANTON HAS TO OFFER.
HMM-MM, SWEET. CHOCOLATE TURTLES.
Yes. NOPE!
no, THOSE ARE FOR OUR CLIENTS.
actually, OUR EX-CLIENTS. I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.
Ryan WANTS EVERYTHING IN OUR COMPANY
to BE ABOUT EMAILS AND I. M.'S.
but I THINK HE IS FOETTING
about THE ORIGINAL INSTANT MESSAGE.
letters ATTACHED TO BASKETS OF FOOD.
excuse ME, ANGELA.
michael ASKED ME TO TURN IN THESE RECEIPTS
for THESE GIFT BASKET ITEMS.
thank YOU.
you're WELCOME.
is THAT ALL?
Yes.
I MISS YOU.
elevators.
Dwight, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.
we ARE NOT SEEING EACH OTHER ANYMORE.
can YOU ACCEPT THAT?
fine.
then I JUST WANNA BE FRIENDS.
good.
plus A LITTLE EXTRA.
also, I LOVE YOU.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.
you DON'T. NO!
you LIED ABOUT BEING PREGNANT.
right, SO?
you REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND
why THAT MIGHT MAKE ME KIND OF ANGRY?
no.
we're NEVER GETTING BACK TOGETHER.
why NOT?
Hi.
Hey.
all RIGHT, I JUST HAVE TO ASK.
now THAT WE'RE PUBLIC,
um, IS THE MAGIC GONE?
it's FUNNY YOU BRING THAT UP,
because YES, IT IS.
I KNEW IT.
Oh, MAN.
just LIKE THAT, HUH?
I THINK...
I MEAN, I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT...
be HONEST.
I NOW FIND YOU REPULSIVE.
that's HONEST.
all RIGHT, FAIR ENOUGH.
it WAS REALLY FUN WHILE IT LASTED, THOUGH, WASN'T IT?
eh.
for ME IT WAS.
okay.
all RIGHT.
Hey, BOSS.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE COMING IN TODAY.
what's, UH, GOING ON HERE?
I AM GLAD THAT YOU ASKED.
listen UP, EVERYBODY!
in THE LAST YEAR, WE HAVE LOST SEVEN CLIENTS TO THE BIG CHAINS.
these GIFT BASKETS ARE OUR TICKETBACK INTO THEIR LIVES.
we ARE GOING TO SHOW UP AT THESE BUSINESSES UNANNOUNCED.
and WE ARE GOING TO WIN THEM BACK.
with GIFT BASKETS.
with PEANUT BRITTLE.
with MACADAMIA NUT COOKIES.
with CHOCOLATE TURTLES.
with RASPBERRY JAM.
and A LITTLE BIT OF FAT AND SALT.
because YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE LIKE.
ever SINCE I WAS A KID,
people HAVE BEEN TELLING ME THAT I CAN'T DO THINGS.
you CAN'T BE ON THE TEAM.
you CAN'T MOVE ON TO SECOND GRADE.
well, NOW THEY'RE TELLING ME THAT I CAN'T

that IS TRUE.
like ANGELA IN ACCOUNTING.
Yes, SHE IS NUTS.
Ugh. NO, SHE'S WONDERFUL.
at ACCOUNTING.
but SHE DRIVES ME CRAZY.
make THE NEXT RIGHT TURN.
how DO THEY KNOW?
how DOES THIS KNOW WHERE TO TURN?
that's VERY IMPRESSIVE.
Hey, PAM.
I HAVEN'T SETTLED ON A FINAL DESIGN LOGO YET FOR DUNDER MIFFLIN INFINITY.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
but I'M EXCITED.
and THE LAST GUY SAYS, NO, HARRY BODY.
you KNOW, I HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE.
Ah.

I HAVE A FEW OF MY OWN THAT I WANT SOMEDAY.
listen,
I DON'T WANNA TAKE ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME.
I KNOW YOU'RE A VERY BUSY MAN.
the REASON WE HAVE STOPPED BY

and TO ASK YOU TO RECONSIDER.
Oh, OKAY.
okay? OKAY!
so YOU'LL RECONSIDER?
okay, THANKS FOR THE GOODIES.
Ah.

he's NOT COMING BACK. IT'S OVER, MICHAEL.
no, IT'S NOT.
no, HE'S RIGHT.
no. ACCEPT IT, WHY WOULD HE COME BACK?
why WOULD HE COME BACK? I WILL TELL YOU, DWIGHT.
he WOULD COME BACK BECAUSE WE OFFER
a WIDE SELECTION OF PRODUCTS.
and YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT GETTING THE SAME SORT OF CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT YOU GET WITH US, ARE YOU?
that's NOT GONNA CHANGE HIS MIND.
he's MOVING ON.
we HAD OUR CHANCE AND WE KILLED IT.
look...
we're ALSO COMING OUT WITH A WEBSITE SOON.
it's A STATE-OF-THE-ART THING.
it'll BE UP AND RUNNING.
it's GONNA CUT COSTS.
and IT WILL MAKE ORDERING MUCH, MUCH EASIER.
well, OKAY.
well, WHEN IT'S UP, I'LL CHECK IT OUT.
and IF IT REALLY CUTS COSTS, MAYBE WE'LL COME BACK.
great.
the MAGIC OF THE GIFT BASKET.
that I DON'T CARE ABOUT AS MUCH.
let ME KNOW WHEN THE SITE'S UP.
okay. GOOD.
don't LET EMILY HAVE ANY OF THE CAJUN ALMONDS.
she's ALLERGIC.
proceed STRAIGHT.
well, WE'RE 0 FOR 6.
last CHANCE IS THE ELMHURST COUNTRY CLUB.
other SIDE OF THE LAKE ON THE SOUTHEAST SIDE.
I DON'T GET IT.
I REALLY DON'T GET IT.
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD WORK.
I THREW EVERYTHING I HAD AT THAT GUY, NOTHING.
that's HOW IT GOES SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW?
you LOSE EVERYTHING, AND EVERYTHING FALLS APART.
and EVENTUALLY YOU DIE AND NO ONE REMEMBERS YOU.
that IS A VERY GOOD POINT.
make A RIGHT TURN.
wait, WAIT, WAIT! NO, NO, NO.
it MEANS BEAR RIGHT.
right THERE. NO, IT SAID RIGHT.
it SAID TAKE A RIGHT.
no, NO, NO. NO, LOOK.
it MEANS GO UP TO THE RIGHT, BEAR RIGHT
over THE BRIDGE AND HOOK UP WITH 307.
maybe IT'S A SHORT CUT, DWIGHT.
it SAID GO TO THE RIGHT.
it CAN'T MEAN THAT. THERE'S A LAKE THERE
look, DWIGHT, I THINK IT KNOWS WHERE IT'S GOING!
this IS THE LAKE! THIS IS THE LAKE!
the MACHINE KNOWS-- STOP YELLING AT ME!
stop YELLING! NO, IT'S UP THERE!
there's NO ROAD HERE!
remain CALM. I HAVE TRAINED FOR THIS.
okay. EXIT THE WINDOW!
here WE GO.
make A U-TURN. IF POSSIBLE.
look OUT FOR NATURE!
are YOU OKAY? SWIM FOR IT!
I GOT YOU! I GOT YOU!

cause THAT IS PRETTY IMPORTANT TOO
at A TIME LIKE THIS.
what A DISASTER. THIS WHOLE THING.
I'll CALL A CAB.
these PEOPLE JUST DON'T REALIZE WHAT A GIFT BASKET MEANS.
they DON'T GET IT.
look AT THAT, STILL WORKS. OLD FASHIONED CELL PHONE.
Yeah.

we're GONNA TAKE A STAND!
take A STAND!
so IT PLAYS ON THE INFINITY THING
without BEING OBVIOUS, YOU KNOW? YEAH, DEFINITELY.
um, I'D LOVE TO DO, LIKE, A COLOR VERSION.
just BRING A LITTLE COLOR...
I LIKE IT A LOT.
it's CLEAR AND SUBTLE AT THE SAME TIME.
it's REALLY GOOD.
you HAVE A REAL TALENT FOR THIS STUFF.
Thanks.
I'd LOVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT MORE.
that'd BE GREAT.
do YOU WANNA GO OUT TO DINNER TONIGHT?
Oh, IS IT...

I'm SORRY. I JUST WANTED TO HAVE DINNER.
I'm, UH... I'M DATING JIM.

Oh, WHAT IS THIS? IT'S REAL SIMPLE.
if YOU DON'T APPRECIATE WHAT WE DO,
then GIVE US BACK OUR BASKET.
maybe YOU SHOULD LEAVE.
Yeah, MAYBE WE SHOULD.
maybe WE SHOULD LEAVE. COME ON, LET'S LEAVE.
but BEFORE WE LEAVE,
my WET FRIEND AND I ARE GONNA WAIT FOR OUR CABS ON YOUR NICE COUCHES!
can YOU CALL US A CAB, PLEASE?
I'm GONNA--OH, SORRY!

I ATE THEM, OKAY? I ATE THE TURTLES.
they're GONE!
we'll BILL YOU.
may I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?
this OFFICE WILL NOT BE USING
any NEW TENOLOGY EVER, STARTING NOW.
that IS NOT CORRECT.
Ryan THINKS THAT TECHNOLOGY IS THE ANSWER.
well, GUESS WHAT?
I JUST DROVE MY CAR INTO A LAKE.
you DID WHAT?
I DROVE MY CAR... INTO A LAKE.
why, YOU MAY ASK, DID I DO THIS?
well...
because OF A MACHINE.
a MACHINE TOLD ME TO DRIVE INTO A LAKE.
and I DID IT.
I DID IT BECAUSE I TRUSTED RYAN'S PRECIOUS TECHNOLOGY.
and LOOK WHERE IT GOT ME.
into A LAKE.
exactly.
did YOU GET ANY CLIENTS BACK?
maybe. MAYBE NOT.
time WILL TELL.
but I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING,
those GIFT BASKETS NEVER ENDANGERED ANYBODY'S LIVES.
game, SET, MATCH.
point. SCOTT.
game OVER.
end OF GAME.
everyone ALWAYS WANTS NEW THINGS.
everybody LIKES NEW INVENTIONS. NEW TECHNOLOGY.
people WILL NEVER BE REPLACED BY MACHINES.
in THE END, LIFE AND BUSINESS
are ABOUT HUMAN CONNECTIONS.
and COMPUTERS ARE ABOUT TRYING TO MURDER YOU IN A LAKE.
and TO ME, THE CHOICE IS EASY.
got it.
okay, let's go in. I'm freezing.
people, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one.
we're gonna do a fun one.
one Charlie's angels. One. Let's go.
okay, this is just a christmas card from your paper supplier.
no one's putting this on their fridge.
I got it, you guys, how 'bout this
Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other.
the boys are, like,"why, I oughta," and the girls are, like,"let's go shopping"?
let's just jump in t air.
that's it! That's a picture! Yes!
jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air.
here we go. - Okay, one... Two... Three... Not everyone jumped.
okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please.
here we go.
one, two, three.
still some people not jumping. - You gotta be kidding me.
who isn't jumping? - I'll tell you who.
Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
I am jumping. - You are?
let me see you jump.
Oh, my god.
this is a store bought camera.
this isn't one of those special military grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
I'm freezing. - also, Erin is jumping way too early.
she's on the ground by "three. - I didn't want to miss it.
well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer.
here's a question nobody's asking Is this worth it?
don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good.
we need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time.
yes? - Why?
I believe in us. We can do this.
okay, on three, everyone in the air.
three, two, one, zero.
we didn't get it.
I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee.
the first thing I did as head... I shut it down.
at its worst it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out.
at its best it planned parties.
it hardly looks fake. It's so lush.
why does it smell real?
good one.
merry christmas, little children! - merry christmas.
how's everybody doing today? - Good.
how's the party coming along?
great.
are we over budget? - Nope.
no? Good.
did anyone get drunk already?
not yet.
good for you.
Angela, lay it on me What's the problem?
nothing. Should be fun.
so, Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
Pam got those sugar free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
all right, well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children.
Andy? - Yeah?
what you got?
it's all good, santa. - Well, that's a relief.
Santa's gonna take some much needed free time.
all right. Good!
my kids are growing up.
as a boss, I look at that and I say great.
it is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want.
that's what every boss wants, is a Is a wonderful christmas with no drama.
it's present time, you guys.
happy holidays from your friends at Sabre.
we just want to say how grateful we are.
sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee.
so I suggested choosing the annual christmas gift to the employees.
and they said, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly.
finally, something for you to do.
it's a hello kitty laptop sleeve.
hello kitty's for girls.
Nashua got mp3 players.
Yeah, I don't even have a laptop.
I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
come on.
I said "i wonder." I didn't say "i think."
Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.
blankets? What am I, five?
Erin and I make great use of ours.
Yes, Erin and I are still dating.
why do you ask me so often if we're still dating?
I'll take one of those pink pouches.
I feel good today.
my little girl Jada?
it's my turn to have her for christmas this year.
two years ago I had her, and we had the best time.
I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of.
Icarly... You know who's funny on that show?
the friend with the video camera.
he's got a nice way of talking.
Hey, it's snowing.
Oh, my god!
it's the first snowfall of christmas.
is that just so magical for you, little girl?
can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with papa and tell him about all your christmas dreams, hmm?
it's not even a real snow.
look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.
damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
well, it's not a snowball,'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
look at that. There's a pebble in there.
you could have killed me!
Oh, don't be such a baby.
Yeah, who's a little girl now?
you apologize to me right now.
you've got something on your nose.
you apologize right now. - No.
very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
you got it.
that sounds awesome.
can we all do it? - no, Andy, it's a snowball fight.
it's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it.
Jim, let go.
Angela, are you bringing your new boyfriend to the party?
I wouldn't subject Robert to that.
he's a very busy senator.
state senator.
I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
who are you dating in the public arena?
the senator.
right.
the state senator.
we went to a picnic thrown my the comptroller's wife.
that would be impressive... If anyone knew what a comptroller was.
well...
do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon cutting ceremony?
I do.
two.
Angela...over here, Angela...here. Look here!
before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that a party.
it's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
Pam. - there are questions to that.
okay.
you know what, no questions.
last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
guys.
I just wanted to let you know that I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.
because you've been on the lam?
because the "boring police" have been after you, - and they finally caught up with you? - No, the opposite.
I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high profile case.
Yes, the case of the horrible red headed sad sack.
and the verdict It was toby.
and the sentence, death.
death to Toby!
death to Toby!
okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that.
you know, - I don't interrupt your announcements.
you leave these huge pauses in your sentences.
what do you expect me to do?
what's the case, Toby?
well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high profile case.
is it criminal?
Yes.
have we heard of it? - I don't know.
is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
come on.
was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
guys, it's a really big deal.
he's rubbing his neck.
he's rubbing his neck!
he's rubbing his neck.
Oh, Scranton strangler!
I can neither confirm nor deny this.
let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty.
that was the worst joke ever.
corporate will be sending someone else to take my place.
okay, good bye. Good bye.
Holly Flax she comes from the nashua branch. - What? What?
Yeah, she'll be starting next week.
if you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.
hold on, Holly's coming back here?
Yeah. - Guys, who's Holly?
that is a great question, Erin.
how do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover... And was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
she's one sassy black lady.
Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.
I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an hr rep really warrants a party.
you know what, we'll postpone this party until then.
this is too important.
cancel this one.
Dwight, get rid of the tree. - Okay.
cancel. We're canceling it. - No, don't throw them out!
no, we have to cancel. - We can save that.
no, no, no. We're gonna get fresh for Holly.
I bought these. These cookies are fine!
they're not. Fresh and new.
Michael, wait.
we don't have. We don't have the budget for another party.
well, then, everybody will chip in it'll be fine.
I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
you know what, I'll pay for it.
I'll pay for the party.
this is way too important.
people, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important christmas party of my life.
so back to work.
man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this!
I was after corporate constantly.
I emailed joe. I wrote letters.
and you know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler.
thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler.
I love you!
you just took one more person's breath away.
we have always had good christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool.
the name is Bond... Santa ond.
I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred.
classic brosnan.
Santa... Wonderful tradition.
everybody loves santa.
everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man.
but that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard.
he's not necessarily an old guy.
no one knows what the real santa claus God!
just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
well, this year's gonna be different.
we're gonna have fun.
it's not gonna be tacky.
it's going to be You know what, the food is going to be austere.
it is not going to be tacky, deli platter food.
it's not gonna have a big, fat, gross santa claus.
it's gonna be a cool, sleek santa.
maybe I'll bring my boyfriend.
I'll invite him. - Okay. Sure.
I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.
you never know about the press.
well, I only ask because he's a senator.
could he help us with some parking tickets?
I don't think that's appropriate. - Well, then he's not a senator.
Yes, he is. - Okay.
we still doing the gifts today?
I mean, it is the christmas party.
well, the classy christmas party. - Yes.
but don't get too excited,'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.
me neither.
okay.
he always gives me the best christmas gifts.
he'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique.
I love them.
so this year I made him something.
a comic book.
it stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild mannered paper salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear
becomes a "bear man." Wreaks havoc on the office.
it's really good.
this is time parking lot at noon
okay...
Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake trees - No, it has the little - Pam, no, no.
Holly's coming from new hampshire.
somebody from new hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross.
no, no.
I want you to go and get a real tree.
take some money. Thank you.
I'm looking for Michael Scott.
Yes, that's me. Come on in.
there's nothing classier than boring jazz music, I am here to tell ya.
and I made a bit of a judgment call.
I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?
any volunteers to come with me to go buy a christmas tree?
I would, but I don't want to get dirty.
there might be girls at the party.
why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party?
no one invited girls. It's just us.
I will help.
although my 'brid... My hybrid My prius hybrid, won't fit a tree.
which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.
I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.
do you mean Darryl?
that's a great idea.
I'll ask him. - You know Darryl?
Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
I should come along, just 'cause he's my You know, he's my hookup.
cool.
come on, now, Justine, look Listen look, I've been planning this, okay?
you cannot do this, Justine.
I'm not doing it!
she told me she wants to have christmas here.
she did? - Yes.
she wants to be around family for christmas.
I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
don't come in, I'm busy.
it's cool, Darryl, I'm here too.
sorry, I really didn't want to come in.
it's just that we have to go buy a new christmas tree, - and we're hoping we could borrow your truck. - no.
come on, it'll be fun.
we could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.
no. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
okay. Sorry. We'll leave you alone.
you know what, I could use a breath of fresh air.
let's do it.
when Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.
I've looked her up online There's nothing about her.
she's made no impression on the internet.
she doesn't need an internet presence you just know.
what the hell are you doing here?
you're supposed to be in the courthouse.
we're on recess.
I came for the party.
everyone. - Toby.
what does the strangler look like?
is he gorgeous?
he looks gorgeous in the drawings. - Yeah
that scowl.
I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury.
and then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.
I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial.
but they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say.
and then one day, we're just talking.
you've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute.
please leave
stop!
I have no feeling in my fingers or penis.
but I think it was worth it.
I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself.
and, Then... "how 'bout icing it?"
is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
I'm really sorry, I can't help you.
I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.
there she is.
Erin, would you help her, for god's sake?
Oh, you're Holly!
of course.
sorry.
hello.
well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott.
you old bastard.
well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard!
well, I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.
why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?
I most certainly am.
homey. - Okay...
Holly's back.
huggy monster!
not the huggy monster!
I don't want to die!
well, everybody, you remember Holly.
did you bring us anything from Nashua?
Yeah. I brought some maple candy. But
I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.
that's adorable.
would you put those out?
to throw out?
or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
Oh, it's so nice to be back.
it looks beautiful in here.
super classy.
it's like a party for limousine drivers.
it's fabulous.
isn't it wonderful?
we love it here.
don't you love it?
all right, let me show you to your desk.
I show you to your dayyy esk!
what kind of guns do you have? Six shooter?
this is weird.
I can't believe you're here.
this feels like you never left.
doesn't it? - Yeah, kind of.
and you have a woody.
I love. - AJg ave me that.
well, that's understandable. Still raw.
woody your favorite character?
you know who my favorite character in toy story is?
Andy's mom. - Why?
because without Andy's mom, there's no plot.
and without any plot, there is no movie.
that is a really good point.
AJ said he hadn't seen any of the toy story movies.
you're kidding me. - No. I know. I'm going,"what?"
are you serious? - what a douche bag!
get a life! - Get a yeah. Good riddance.
we sat down and we watched them all in one day.
now he's the biggest toy story fanatic ever.
good for him.
next day I found him in my bed.
Really?
that's creepy.
how did AJ get in your house?
we live together.
you do?
he had a little note pinned to him that said,"you've got a friend in me.
Yeah, Randy Newman's the best.
Yeah.
I love him. - Me too.
Christmas tree, christmas tree ?
won't you be my christmas tree?
how about this one?
seems a little full of itself, right?
kind of a pretty boy.
and we just loved it for what it is?
maybe.
I mean... No, she be talking to your mom or something.
this is my daughter too, Justine!
you seem to think
pick a damn tree already.
Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for christmas,Ii'd be really upset too.
I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself.
Jada don't want to spend christmas with me.
she told her mom it wasn't as much fun.
how could she say that?
you know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
well, Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own christmas presents her mom wants me to take her to mass.
I guess that's something to do.
no, you should have her mom do the boring christmas stuff on her time.
you should be associated with the fun parts of christmas.
how do I do that?
bring her to the party.
Yeah, we'll have santa, and we'll play games with her.
it'll be a lot of fun.
Yes!
you'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
guys, the tree's here.
nobody hug me I'm covered in tree sap, so...
hey there, jada.
nice to see you again.
I'm santa claus.
welcome.
it's a sophisticated take.
he doesn't look like santa claus.
no, he doesn't.
I told her santa would be here.
Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here,
who told you that?
Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
so is it an open relationship?
God, no.
well, you're almost 40.
Oh, do you not want kids? - Oh, I want kids.
I really want kids.
but AJ and I are practically engaged.
we talk about spending our lives together.
so where's the ring? - Kelly!
how are you adjusting to the move? - Nobody cares about that.
look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
you guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.
Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
I don't get it.
I'm sorry.
I just I don't get it.
okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over.
an ultimatum. - Yeah.
it doesn't really seem like you.
that is a great idea.
ultimatums are key.
basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
don't.
stop Dwight!
no. no! - Stop!
Yes, taste my wrath! - Okay.
okay - You like that?
seriously!
okay. Okay.
Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office.
you never know when you're gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
I just want it to stop.
so cool, right?
there's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
okay.
we need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear.
otherwise it's the bear's quest.
okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or
it sounds like you know what you want.
it's also a little derivative of a serial called bear man.
did you look that up? - No.
okay.
who looks exactly like you. - That's incredible.
Yeah. No, it's uncanny. - You know what's crazy?
I can't reconnect with you right now.
hold on one second.
excuse me.
I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't.
and that's just the way it is.
and I can be mature about that.
it's so cold. Even with my coat on.
maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car for screwing Americans.
yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.
you guys, this has to stop.
someone could have really gotten hurt.
you know what would have happened?
the shards of glass would have shaved her face right off.
and, yes, it might have been funny, but it also would have been incredibly tragic.
I could not agree more.
and I just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
what are you talking about?
you're the one terrorizing me.
with snowballs, Jim?
with fluffy little snowballs?
no. I thought we were just playing.
Dwight's right.
what you did was dangerous and inappropriate.
I'm really surprised at you guys.
last time I was here, you were both best friends.
all this arguing reminds me of a very funny story.
you see this on my desk?
know who gave me this?
my girlfriend Tara, who lives in new york city.
wait, what girlfriend?
I haven't told you about her.
you email me when you get a new zit.
I'm a man in my mid 40s and I still get zits.
I think that's pretty interesting.
but you know what, I am not on trial here.
the Scranton strangler is.
so anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to jfk, but I'm flying out of laguardia.
so we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around slomo drinking latte.
and at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says,"Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab."
I didn't know you had a girlfriend. - I do. She is.
did you see her face?
well, it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael g. Scott.
and it ain't Tara.
so you went homemade this year. - Yep.
money problems is that what this is about?
I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.
no, no.
Jim had a great year, actually.
I just wanted to get your opinion.
are you good at homemade?
look at this.
Yeah.
who did this?
it's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving.
well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.
that's not true.
I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
what happened? What happened?
Toby, what did you do?
I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting.
no, I would never ever do anything like that.
but it does seem like something you would do.
Really? Turn it on me.
well, isn't that nice?
thank you very much. - Wait, wait, guys, listen.
toy story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking.
you don't think... It's not possible... That woody did this to himself?
it is christmas.
no, it really seems like something Michael would do.
well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me.
and that I have been framed. - Why would anyone frame you for that?
okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole "woody came to life" thing so quickly?
surprise! It was part of the party.
pretty funny, huh?
you think this is funny?
I don't.
but someday I think we will laugh about this...
when we tell our kids - Yikes.
my god.
all right!
okay... You know what, Holly, I didn't mean to do it.
it was an accident.
an accident borne of jealous feelings.
Michael, you have to let this go.
I'm with someone else.
I don't feel that way anymore.
Oh, really?
well, you certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend.
that's what Jim and Dwight thought.
no, fake girlfriends are always wrong.
you made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous?
and you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me?
what is the matter with you?
when you got transferred, and I drove you up to nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I can't do this.
but then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long distance relationship, do you?
and you know what, that is what is the matter with me.
Michael, I'm sorry. - And we did this whole stupid party for you.
no.
you guys, it wasn't my fault.
nothing is ever your fault.
just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
I really think you're better off.
Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
Yeah.
is she an amazing cook or something?
pickles, merry christmas. open immediately?
love, swiss cheese.
damn it, Dwight!
didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim?
let that be a lesson to you all.
so do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
no, they bring it in.
you lucky son of a bitch.
I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old.
to get to go sit in an air conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... That is the life.
daddy, I'm bored.
can I read my book in your office?
sure, sweetie.
Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys.
a grinch stole the star from on top of the christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere.
you want to go help me find him?
my goodness.
I am the mean old grinch.
the little girl who wishes to win back the christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.
that sounds fun and christmasy, you mean old grinch.
what kind of challenges?
something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?
no.
you must answer topical political questions.
how many congressmen is the state of pennsylvania guaranteed?
and what other state has the equal number?
I don't know.
do you know the other state? - maybe the grinch hid the christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.
the star has been hidden.
is the little girl hot or cold?
well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear!
and the game's over seconds later.
I'm so glad you could come. - It's nice. I know.
everybody, this is my boyfriend, senator Robert Lipton.
senator, it's an honor.
I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
a pleasure.
robert seems great.
he's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
hello.
I'm, I'm AJ. I'm here to see Holly.
it's kind of a surprise.
I know who you are, and I think you should go.
I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?
was I supposed to bring you guys something?
what? Aj! - Surprise.
what are you doing here? - I wanted to see you.
how are you? - Nice.
Oh, my god. you look great.
when did you get here?
just now. Just now.
good to see you again, AJ. Welcome. - Pleased to see you. Thank you.
good trip down? - Yeah, it was great.
good, good. Good to see you.
have fun. Enjoy the party.
I am dead inside.
what do you want, baby?
we got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...
you have a whole room of vending machines.
I know. Isn't it something?
I can't decide what I want.
merry christmas.
merry christmas. - Thank you.
and merry christmas. - Thank you.
and merry christ... Mas.
thank you so much. - Merry christmas.
and merry christmas. - Merry christmas to you.
merry christmas. - thank you.
for your feet.
it's amazing.
it's so great. Thank you.
for me? - Yes.
thank you very much.
how to quit biting your nails
I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
wow, that's awesome!
a real David and Goliath story.
I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work.
I am.
the real problem is the teachers' union.
zip it, Meredith. - No.
you tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
who's in charge of making drinks around here?
is there a bartender?
you are. You make your own drink.
I'll make it. What are you drinking?
an "f" train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.
I don't know how to make that.
okay, well, I'll just stick with my mohito.
and you know those annoying geese at the park?
well, he's helping eradicate them as well.
I mean, I think they've really become a pest.
I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.
well, uh... I don't think any of us really know.
all right.
is it... Is it pebbles from the beach in jamaica?
go easy with the shaking.
Oh, my god.
you like it?
I love it.
Yep, I do make great christmas gifts.
but I couldn't make that.
all right, my turn.
it's just I didn't I didn't have a lot of time, so - that's just a place holder. - Right. Of course.
the adventures of Jimmy Halpert.
Oh... My... God.
this is awesome!
that's my bike.
that's my desk.
and that is my daughter.
I mean...
better office policy up there.
but it should be the same policy as us.
Michael, wait.
no, don't run. You're gonna slip.
that's good advice. - Yep.
I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever.
and then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.
that's a sad story.
Yeah, well, at least he was married.
Oh, okay, Michael, slow down.
everything's gonna be okay.
no, it's not. It's not.
man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.
I shouldn't tell you this, but...
AJ won't commit to Holly.
and she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.
Really?
really.
and I don't know about you, but
I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum... Do you?
no.
so just be patient.
Yeah.
I mean, I can wait till then.
come here.
I don't want you to fall.
I surrender.
I do not accept your surrender.
there's only one way that I would ever relent.
anything. You got it.
you hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
you're a psychopath. - I'll take that as a no.
I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.
Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out.
you're re gifting this to me.
no, that's not No, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.
yeah? Well, show me the receipt.
from the mall.
this is a fast food receipt from april.
well... That... - God, how many number nines did you order?
is everyone here kind of mean?
I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial.
I'm so glad you came down.
it's been so much harder than I expected.
what happened to woody?
okay, get ready for this.
you're not gonna believe it.
I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing.
I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.
he smells awful.
it was blue cheese dressing.
great.
Hey, Mike.
we wanted to give you something.
merry christmas. - Thank you. A hostess apple pie!
this is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that?
thank you very much.
what do you say?
you're welcome.
you know, I seem to remember that santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for christmas.
didn't he say that?
I think I know where he is.
a trampoline...
video games. - Video games.
a horse. - A horse.
are you sure you don't want a pony?
you want a real horse.
all right.
you have to pick up after them.
sorry. I'm ready.
I don't want to go.
come on, bear man.
come on.
have you ever seen 'em do that?
I'm sorry.
I had no idea. - No, it's it's okay.
okay. - Oh my god.
my god. No, no, no, no.
okay, this is it.
what? What? What is it? - Go! Go! Go!
Oh, my god!
honey?
in the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all.
it's fear.
merry christmas.
in New York City, there's a fine line between law and chaos.
on that line live Danson and Highsmith.
tell me again why I decided to get on this roof!
I think you can chalk that up to bad life choices.
get rid of that asshole.
Uh-oh! I hate it when you say "uh-oh"!
dude, you put a ding in my hood!
come on with it, then!
that's trouble.
did someone call Nine-One-holy-shit?
that's it. I'm sick of all this running.
hang on!
you have the right to remain silent!
but I wanna hear you scream!
down on the ground!
detective! Yeah, yeah! Detective!
one at a time, all right?
Yeah, Detectives, Rick Grayson,
new York Observer Online.
these suspects were caught with only a quarter pound of marijuana, a misdemeanor in some states.
do you think this arrest was worth $12 million in property damages?
why don't we let New York City answer that question?
the greatest city on Earth, yeah!
Hi, Sarah Gapone from TMZ print edition.
Danson, are the rumors about you and Kim Kardashian true?
no comment.
but, yes.
Danson and Highsmith, free hot dogs for life!
no drinks. No drinks. I can't do it. I can't do it.
Danson and Highsmith shoot, drive, and sex with style.
they're rock stars.
then you got your jokers, your ball busters, your vets and the other guys.
we know, we know. We know.
all right, all right, all right. Listen up, listen up!
we're having a celebration tonight at Butter.
Brody Jenner's gonna be there. Bai Ling.
that little short bitch from Jersey Shore. Yeah!
and most of you are on the list.
you're the best.
guys, I'm gonna say something right now.
it's about a man who came from Austria with a dream.
arnold Schwarzenegger! Let me finish.
he became a champion and then a movie star, all right?
arnold Schwarzenegger! God damn it, let me...
they ruined the story. They ruined the story.
Let...what the point is, we couldn't do our job if it weren't for you guys doing all the paperwork, answering the phones, and all that stupid shit that we don't like to do.
all the gun fights all the car chases all the sex we don't wanna have with women, but we have to, all due to what you guys do. Thank you.
and we'd do it again and again.
Hey, you shut your face!
if we wanna hear you talk,
I will shove my arm up your ass and work your mouth like a puppet!
you hear me? You hear me?
cash bar. Yeah.
peace out, bitches.
Hey, fellas. All right, bring it in.
come on. Bring it in a little bit.
all right, right there.
just back up, just like right there.
all right, just one...Just a...
there you go, right there. Right there.
this is their paperwork. You know they're not gonna do it.
that's right. This paperwork is like Bob's wife here.
it's thick, ugly, got Danson's fingerprints all over it.
no offense, Bob. That's all right.
anyway, now who wants it? I do!
all right! Paper Bitch and Yankee Clipper on the case!
nice work. Thanks, Allen. Thank you, Captain.
I'll do it! I'll do it!
stop humming that song!
I can hum if I want to. - No, I know you can.
I'm asking you to stop.
well, if you're asking, then I'll stop. - Thank you.
could you not smile like that?
now you're asking me to mask my emotions because of how it makes you feel.
that I will not do.
seriously, stop humming! Okay?
this isn't accounting or wherever the hell you and your little pocket calculator were transferred from.
forensic accounting, okay. And it's an important part of the job.
Yeah, whatever.
stop being so overtly happy about doing shit work, you moron.
Hey, guys. Reminder.
the police union picnic's coming up this weekend.
my wife's making her famous deviled eggs, again. My waistline's furious.
it's a bad time, Bob!
all right.
going to get a slice.
you know what I just did?
I just walked out that door, saw a couple detectives, and I was about to start bad mouthing you behind your back, but I stopped myself, because my pops taught me that a man who talks behind somebody's back is a coward.
wow, I actually appreciate that.
good, 'cause I'm gonna tell you directly to your face.
no. You don't have to. - No, I don't like you.
I think you're a fake cop.
the sound of your piss hitting the urinal? It sounds feminine.
if we were in the wild, I would attack you.
even if you weren't in my food chain,
I would go out of my way to attack you.
if I were a lion, and you were a tuna,
I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and freaking eat you!
and then I'd bang your tuna girlfriend.
okay, first off, a lion swimming in the ocean?
lions don't like water.
if you'd placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source, that'd make sense.
but you find yourself in the ocean, 20-foot waves,
I'm assuming it's off the coast of South Africa, coming up against a full-grown, 800-pound tuna with his 20 or 30 friends?
you lose that battle.
you lose that battle nine times out of ten. And guess what?
you've wandered into our school of tuna, and we now have a taste of lion.
we've talked to ourselves. We've communicated.
yeah? And said, "You know what"?
lion tastes good. Let's go get some more lion.
we've developed a system to establish a beachhead and aggressively hunt you and your family.
and we will corner your pride, your children, your offspring. How you gonna do that?
we will construct a series of breathing apparatus with kelp.
we will be able to trap certain amounts of oxygen.
it's not gonna be days at a time, but an hour, hour 45, no problem.
that will give us enough time to figure out where you live, go back to the sea, get more oxygen, and then stalk you.
did that go the way you thought it was gonna go?
Nope.
two minutes before the markets open,
Pamela Boardman, CEO of Lendl Global, ringing the opening bell.
with Boardman is investment banker, David Ershon, who manages 40% of Lendl's $70-billion equity pool.
how much did we lose?
you may ring the bell now, Ms. Boardman.
$32 Million?
no, billion.
shit!
Chinatown. Three Triad gang members. I popped two of them off the draw.
bang, bang. Yeah.
then I raise up to take the leader out.
shit, I feel like I'm there now.
I hear a whistle. My partner's on the roof.
he says, "Let's even the odds!
he tosses me down a Mossberg pump. I send one through his chest.
game over, bitches.
all right. Yeah.
Jimmy? Let's talk about how that story made you feel.
like my cock was made out of concrete.
I know it's very tempting.
you want to impress your friends.
but this is serious stuff we're dealing with, okay?
this is firing your weapon in the line of duty.
officer Hoitz?
Oh, man.
come on! Here we go.
would you like to share?
no, I'd rather not.
officer Hoitz, you've been coming here for six months now, and you haven't said a word.
this is a safe room, no judgment here.
jerkoff.
that's judgment, Jimmy. Come on.
I relive it every night.
bronx, October.
game 7 of the World Series.
for all the marbles. High pressure, unruly crowd, and I pulled tunnel duty.
I mean, I saw a shadowy figure in the tunnel. I told him to stop.
whoa, whoa, whoa, this is a restricted area!
finally pulled my gun.
pulled a deadly weapon. He started running at me.
don't make me shoot! I'll do it!
are you deaf? You hear me yell, "Freeze"?
you dick! I'm Derek Jeter! You shot me!
you cost me 20 grand on that game! Douche bag.
cost the city a championship.
I was being groomed for a top position in homicide.
now I'm stuck with a desk jockey partner.
everybody calls me the Yankee Clipper.
because you shot Derek Jeter!
he's a biracial angel.
you should've shot A-Rod.
yo, Paper Bitch.
what's up, man? Hey. Hey, guys.
paper Bitch. Paper Bitch.
I don't like that, actually.
I know you guys think it's fun, but I don't like that name.
still working on the Danson and Highsmith paperwork?
shit. No, actually, actually, that's...
what is this? That looks stupid.
guys, it's illegal permitting for construction.
specifically, scaffolding.
some of the guys were talking.
they were like, " How come you've never fired your weapon in the office before"?
good point.
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
you've never fired your weapon in the office.
we all have, you know. It's called a desk pop.
fellas, look, I know you don't respect me as a police officer.
not true. I'm not stupid.
I'm not gonna discharge my firearm in the office.
gamble, listen to me. I'll try to make it real clear.
we honor the flag, and you crap on it when you don't shoot your gun in the office.
Jimmy. When's the last time you had a desk pop?
september '08.
be a man. Do it. Now.
please, please, do it. Pop one off!
there you go. Pop it off! Don't think, just go!
here we go. Do it, yes.
he did it!
Hey! Shots fired!
Hey, Terry, I did it! I did my first desk pop!
it's a real thing, right?
a desk pop? Yeah.
no, that's not real!
they were so convincing in their argument, they swung me.
all right, Allen, you're gonna have to hand over your gun.
Yes, sir.
captain, you really wanna disarm this guy, take out the batteries in the calculator.
all right, I'm gonna give you this. This is a dummy gun.
I use it for ceremony.
there.
you get this back when I feel you know how to handle it.
listen, guys. I'm working two jobs. I'm working here.
and I got another job at Bed Bath and Beyond. Okay?
I'm doing that just to put a kid through NYU so he can explore his bisexuality and become a deejay.
now the last thing I need is a ballistics report in the unit.
I'm just gonna ask you guys, please, come on, really.
just think about...Just be smart.
they're using a wrecking ball to clean out Castien Jewelry.
all right, we got it.
good luck, guys. Have a good one. Allen, let's go.
no, I got work to do. What? This is work!
Hey, yo! Danson and Highsmith. We roll in heavy.
you cream puffs, sit tight.
you gotta be shitting me!
you can't keep me cooped up in here, okay?
I am a peacock! You gotta let me fly!
did he just... did he just call himself a peacock?
let's go! Let's go!
come on, fellas!
wednesday night is taco night at Rikers Island!
that's the second one this week!
Hey, you monkeys! Stop!
let's go!
Yeah!
heads up!
shit.
special Forces zipline.
cut that line! Cut it! Let's go!
these guys are pros. Let's go!
you thinking what I'm thinking, partner?
aim for the bushes.
cops still argue to this day why Danson and Highsmith jumped.
maybe it was just pride, having survived so many brushes with death.
maybe their egos pushed them off.
I don't know. But that shit was crazy.
either way, there was a hole in New York City, and it needed to be filled.
two days ago, this city wept.
we lost two heroes who gave everything for us, who paid that ultimate sacrifice so that we may walk these streets safely.
there wasn't even an awning in their direction.
no, I know. They just jumped 20 stories.
doesn't make sense, does it?
I only hope God lets them take their. 357s with them to heaven.
it's our moment, Allen.
our moment to step up and be the guys.
we're at a funeral. Show some respect. What?
you don't think every other detective here isn't thinking the same thing?
allen, listen to me. Danson and Highsmith are gone.
their desks are empty. Someone has to fill those seats.
that someone is us, okay? The city's dying for a hero.
is it? Yeah.
what about nine million socially-conscious and unified citizens, all just stepping up and doing their part?
as a little kid, didn't you dress up and play cops and robbers?
I'll tell you what I did as a little kid.
I went to school and made my bed.
and at age 11, I audited my parents.
and believe me, there were some discrepancies, and I was grounded.
what the hell are you?
well, well, well. What do we got here?
look at these two jamokes, would you?
one shot Jeter and the other shot an office.
have some decorum. We're at a funeral.
you wanna dance, brolio?
I will rock your body with big, nasty hooks.
you'll be pissing blood out of your ass.
that's horrible.
why don't you step back, man?
you touch him, I swear to God
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you with Allen's head.
he's not gonna do that. That's hyperbole. But that's a weird example.
you wanna go? I wanna go!
get him off. Kick his ass, Martin.
Yeah. How do you like that?
pull his hair! I love it.
this hurts so good.
very sorry for your loss, ma'am. What a lovely hat.
I love your shoes.
it's fine, it's fine. Go, go.
punish him!
Oh, man.
do it. That's how we do it in the hood.
punish him. That's not even a move.
I'm the winner. I'm the winner, everybody saw it.
what the hell is going on here?
two good men are dead, you guys are fighting over who's gonna be the next hotshot?
is that what's happening?
Yes, that's exactly what's happening.
let me tell you something.
sorry for your loss, Lorraine. Very sorry.
sorry, Lorraine. Sorry, Lorraine.
Hi, I'm Jimmy.
too soon? Why'd you say that?
I'll tell you something about those guys.
they knew that to become a good cop, you had to solve cases. Okay?
okay, and maybe you start with the Castien robbery.
okay? So just watch it.
next time, me, you, library.
not even close. Come on, guys. Guys, come on.
you are... I'm the winner!
I didn't need you to stick up for me, okay?
I could've handled that myself.
Hey, don't flatter yourself. It's the partner's code. I had no choice.
move.
9: 15, let's have a great day, everybody! Cut the shit!
good morning.
we've got shots fired. 509 East 10th Street.
there are large amounts of cocaine on the scene.
try to stay out of trouble, boys.
there's no chance you'd wanna go on that call, right?
no chance. Too busy.
all right, ladies. Starting to get the picture?
we're about to lock shit down.
that's right. You girls stay here and get your type on.
go get them, guys. Lot of energy, lot of focus.
shut up!
allen, could I see you in the hallway for a second?
I...I'm super busy right now, Terry.
no, no, no, I know. This'll be real quick.
it's about the construction permits you were talking about.
the scaffolding violations? This is our thing, yeah.
so, what do you got?
I got this! I'll put one right in your neck.
what are you doing?
let's go. We're going to that call.
what is this? Shut up.
we're going to the car, and we're going after this case.
you're not gonna shoot me. I won't?
no. I shot Jeter.
that was an accident. Was it?
now move. Okay.
Hey.
does anybody see this? He's got a gun on me.
I'm being kidnapped.
really, we're in a police station and no one is interested in this?
so, then what happened? What do you think happened?
I woke up, I took the belt off my neck, and I got in my car, and I got out of there.
talk about a wild weekend, right?
I thought I was gonna have to shoot my way out.
what are you gonna do, though, you know? Bar mitzvahs.
what the hell is this?
it's my car. It's a Prius.
I feel like we're literally driving around in a vagina.
detective Hoitz and Gamble are on that 518 on East 10th.
Negatory, Martin and Fosse, two minutes out.
we'll just see who's there first.
you stay out of our crime scene! You hear me?
go, go, go!
you feel that, Allen? That tingling in your balls?
big metal butterflies fluttering around in your stomach?
are you sure you don't have testicular cancer?
I got something to get you going.
let's go do some damage!
Nope.
what the hell is that?
lrb. Little River Band.
this music makes me feel like I'm going shopping for a training bra.
you know what? We go with no music, okay?
fine. Say bye.
no, no, no, don't say bye...
you just signed your own death warrant, Hoitz!
allen, punch that accelerator or I will shoot you in the foot!
America!
Allen! Allen, hit the brake!
seriously, slow the car down! We're approaching the crime scene!
Terry, I'm coming in.
you're gonna smash right through the tape! Allen!
dude! What...
that's a lot of cocaine.
did you yell "America" when you hit the accelerator?
Nope. No. No.
I've never actually put my foot all the way down to the ground with the accelerator like that.
it got me slightly aroused.
here we go.
way to put your stamp on the crime scene, guys.
prius, huh? Yep, yep.
good mileage?
outstanding. Yeah.
did this come with a dental dam?
no. Get it?
my Suburban shit one of these last night.
I didn't know they put tampons on wheels.
we've had our fun, huh?
looks like Scarface sneezed on your car.
all right, everybody!
I'm gonna need you all to back up now. We're taking over.
at the crime scene, LOL.
good tweet, good tweet. Yeah, thanks.
america has always been defined by its excess.
the Grand Canyon, professional sports contracts.
Wendy's Baconator, extra bacon.
I myself have 18 Lamborghinis and a Subaru station wagon.
and it's because of this excess that I have flourished.
I implore you, please, do not stop profiting.
live for excess. It's the American way.
hello.
Mr. Ershon? I believe this call's for you.
sir David.
David. You're not returning my calls, so I'd like you to meet Roger Wesley.
G'day, mate. Hey.
Roger and his team are gonna babysit you because I don't trust you, because I think you're going to take off.
Pamela, this is ridiculous. I'm not going anywhere.
David, listen, the Lendl quarterlies come out on the 26th.
you have until then to give me my money.
I'm not reporting any losses, David.
I have zeroed in on a new investor.
well, then, you get their money, make it disappear, and then pay us back.
Yes, yes, I'll tell him he doesn't need to keep watching me.
David! Okay, sweetheart, bye-bye.
Yeah. She overreacted. She's a woman. So, you're good to go.
heard everything, mate.
ladies and gentlemen, guess who gave me the secrets to making my first billion dollars.
that man there.
go! Go!
side! Step aside, please.
you don't think I'm a real cop, do you?
no, I don't. I've said that directly to your face numerous times.
I was really honest about that.
I'm working on a huge case, all right?
property owner with seven buildings under construction.
he hasn't applied for a single scaffolding permit.
now, according to Ask Jeeves, this perp is at the Plaza Hotel speaking right now.
that's your big case? Scaffolding permits? Yeah.
guess what? You're coming with me.
it's a wooden gun.
that hurts, man!
I've always got Little River Band loaded up here.
I've got six disks in here.
Claude, meet me outside, at the back of the service entrance.
I'm flying Air Singapore.
Hey, Douglas. How's the wife? She died.
Attaboy!
I'll be there in two minutes exactly.
another thing I hate about you? You always pay in exact change.
you're just mad because I have a nice change purse.
why do you even care?
how can I help it? You know what? You know what's worse?
the way you fart. Even your farts, they're not manly.
you're being ridiculous.
they sound like a baby blowing out the candles on a birthday cake.
what? Like a little...
you know what bugs me about you? What?
I'm pretty sure you've never voted.
no, I vote. Sports radio, AM 880. Play of the week.
you're like a child in a leather jacket. That's what you're like.
get out of the way, man!
wait. Are you David Ershon?
Yeah, well, it's Sir David Ershon, but I don't bother with the...
anyway, little bit of a rush, gentlemen, if you don't mind. Thank you.
excuse me, but you're under arrest, okay? What?
you have the right to remain silent. Anything you do or say can be used
what's the next part? As a floatation device.
as a floatation device.
you know what? That's very funny. I have never Mirandaed anyone before.
Really? Are you guys for real?
am I being punk'd?
detective Allen Gamble.
we are in a cocaine-covered car, and we are bringing in a perp.
one David Ershon. 175 pounds.
thank you. 175 pounds. Shut up, man, shut up!
martin and Fosse are probably on Studio B talking to Shepard Smith right now.
we arrest this jerkoff for a scaffolding permit?
wait, wait, wait, what am I being arrested for?
for scaffolding permit violation...
I got my insurance card. Somewhere. Easy, mate.
what the hell? You ran right into us! Stand over there.
wood?
what the...
couldn't see the car. It's big enough, mate. What?
do not let these men take me.
Hi.
Why's she looking at you like that?
that's my car!
Hey, hey, hey! We didn't exchange insurance information!
Hey! Excuse me!
why did they take our shoes?
what the hell just happened? Where's my iPhone?
I think we've walked 30 blocks, man.
I don't get why we can't just call the office and have a squad car come pick us up.
no. They took our shoes, our guns, and our car.
look, if we're gonna do this together, there's some issues we need to settle, okay?
I mean, you said I had a weak chin. You said the way I pee is feminine.
how do you think that makes me feel?
I mean, that list you have, you put a lot of thought in. It's weird.
I hear you.
let's clean the slate right now. Fresh start.
all right. Fresh start.
maybe we should call ourselves the Febreze Brothers, 'cause it's feeling so fresh right now.
right?
let's do another fresh start, 'cause I just wanted to punch you in the face.
fine, fresh start.
it's the last one.
I have to be able to express myself and say things, you know.
okay, folks! Everybody, listen up! Listen up!
got a high profile kidnapping.
david Ershon, wealthy banker, multinational team.
maybe a sleeper cell, but it's too early to tell.
Hey, Bilbo Baggins. Where are your shoes? 'Cause your feet are black.
who cares? It's not important, okay?
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain. Not good.
Bye, guys. Bye-bye.
come on.
guys, this is Don Beaman, the attorney for Mr. Ershon.
Roger Wesley, head of his private security.
Hey, how are you? You son of a bitch! Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, Terry! Take it easy!
that's the guy who took our guns, Captain.
and my shoes! Wait a minute, wait a minute.
did you identify yourselves as police officers?
what is this?
allen, tell me. Did you? No, we did not.
sorry, gentlemen.
we thought you were abducting Mr. Ershon.
it's only protocol.
Mr. Ershon has agreed to correct this scaffolding situation.
the case is closed.
I've taken care of all necessary paperwork.
and you fellas, at this point, should just be glad that
Mr. Ershon is not pressing charges for excessive use of force.
thank you, Captain. You bet.
Australian?
special Forces, right?
best watch your step, Detective.
there are three things I love in this world.
kylie Minogue, small dimples just above a woman's buttocks...
beautiful features.
and the fear in a man's eye who knows I'm about to hurt him.
come on, man.
all right, look, they returned your shoes.
and they returned your weapons. Here you go, Terry.
allen, someone was nice enough to put linseed oil on it, some kind of stain on that, dark walnut or something.
you might wanna think about dropping them a thank you note.
okay.
you're mad at us, huh, Gene?
first off, don't call me Gene. I'm your captain.
guys, do you remember the "Be Smart" speech?
sure. All right.
well, what did you do? What'd you do about it?
the opposite. We were not smart, Captain Gene.
it's just "Captain."
just "Captain. " It's not "Captain Gene. " I don't have a kiddie show.
that sounds creepy, "Captain Gene."
police mistakenly arrest investment banker, David Ershon.
was he the victim of financial profiling?
financial profiling? That's crazy.
he broke the law and we arrested him.
that wasn't a security team. He said, "Don't let these people take me."
I mean, when you hear hooves, you think horses, not zebras.
what about donkeys or deer?
they have hooves. What about bovine creatures?
were you just thinking to yourself, "Fresh start"?
Yeah. Yeah. I could see it.
listen, why don't we just go over to my place?
we'll talk the case down.
we can have a little dinner. You can meet Sheila.
two cops talking down a case while eating food, all right?
it's not dinner. Fine.
and let me apologize in advance, okay, in case my wife acts like a world-class bitch.
she's a big old broad, and she likes to wield it.
okay, so I put together a little bio, complete with pictures of Mr. David Ershon.
I used Adobe Premiere. I like to do a little weekend editing.
I recently just cut three minutes out of Goodfellas.
david Ershon is currently the CEO of Ershon Consortium.
who's that talking?
it's the Frontline Narration App. It's only 99 cents.
Ershon Consortium, current financial investments exceed $70 billion.
his largest clients include Schering-Plough and Lendl Global.
Lendl Global has those TV ads where I can't figure out what they do.
Yeah, oil, media, health care, you've probably heard their jingle.
Lendl Global, we're in everything
david Ershon is often found in the company of Judge Scalia...
Yeah. And the lead singer of Maroon 5.
I mean, this guy could be connected to drug cartels, black market organ sales, human trafficking, all of it.
how do you get that from anything I just said?
Hey, guys! Soup's on.
what do you mean?
Hi.
Hi. You must be Terry.
I'm sorry I've been hiding, honey, but this dinner was tricky.
who are you? I'm Dr. Sheila Gamble, his wife.
come on, seriously. Who is that? His old lady.
sweetie, it's a workstation. Got it.
and you come in here, dressed like a hobo, it's distracting.
I know you're working. I'm so sorry.
come on, seriously. - Come on, what?
who is that?
get over here.
not... not right now.- Okay.
look, they're not all first-round picks, okay?
come on, are you gonna tell me who that is?
are you really Allen's wife? I know.
people are shocked because he's Episcopalian and I'm Catholic, but somehow it works.
are you gonna change? - I already did.
it's no big deal. You look really, really nice.
Terry, you don't have to be polite, okay? She looks kind of shitty.
don't speak to her like that, Allen.
look, if I put that in my Cosmo Fashion App, you'd probably get a D-.
allen and his apps. He loves them.
you know he's designed three of his own? One of them... can I tell him?
one of them, you can take a picture of anybody's face, and it'll tell you what the back of his head looks like.
Faceback. - Faceback.
got some horrible reviews coming out of the gate.
it's gonna hit. It's gonna catch.
why are you with Allen?
I mean, that's not what I meant. I meant, how did you guys meet?
it's a really typical "how we met" story, Terry.
you're gonna be bored by it.
I was a dancer for the Knicks while finishing my residency at Columbia Hospital.
allen came into the ER with poison ivy on his rectum.
Yes.
needless to say, I fell for him immediately.
we immediately spent the next three days at the La Quinta Inn, and, to be honest, we didn't speak. Three days of not communicating once verbally.
we had actually, without knowing it, developed a language of eye flutters and non-verbal gestures.
you know, Terry, it was just this primal connection.
after those three days of non-verbal communication and a whole lot of loving,
I had to go to a specialist to get my hips realigned.
similar to operating on a German shepherd when they have hip dysplasia. Very painful.
it's funny, it's like a scene from that one movie, always forget the name of it.
with Meg Ryan. - Yes.
I don't remember a movie where Meg Ryan meets a guy with poison ivy up his ass.
I'll think of it. I'll think of it. - Okay.
so, what about you, Terry? Do you have a girl?
I did, yeah.
we were supposed to get married, but she backed out. It's complicated.
Terry shot Derek Jeter.
shut up, Allen. This was before.
that's okay.
she's Got Mail. That's the name of the movie.
that's it! Honey!
with Tom Hanks? - Right.
and Meg Ryan. - Meg Ryan.
he didn't have poison ivy up his ass.
Yes, he did. - Yes, he did. Yeah.
way up there.
well, Terry, can't thank you enough for coming by. What a...
what a wonderful, lovely evening. Thank you.
it was so, so nice meeting you, Terry.
it was my pleasure. Thank you.
and remember, all I ask of you is, you don't let him get hurt, Terry.
she tells me that every day before I leave. - Yep, I do.
I come downstairs and I make him his fresh-cut strawberries, and I say, " Listen, my little sugar balls, whatever you do today, "you just don't get hurt.
Yeah. Every morning.
and then I show him my breasts, and I say, " These are waiting for you "when you get back home. " - Right.
you know, Terry, they're not the biggest breasts he's ever seen, but, man, are they perky. - Not by a long shot.
and they are firm, and they are yours. - You're a nice lady.
thank you for coming.
detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Over.
go for Hoitz.
we found your red Prius. - Great.
it was trying to vote for Ralph Nader.
come on. Okay, sugar balls, listen up.
there's gonna be fingerprints on that car.
tomorrow, we're gonna run those fingerprints through the system.
and if we get a hit, this case is gonna heat up faster than a junkie's spoon.
you do one thing when you wake up tomorrow, bring it.
okay.- Thank you, Sheila.
he'll bring it.
good night! - Good night.
thank you, Sheila.
Bye, Terry!- Bye, Sheila! I'll never forget tonight.
Bye, Terry!- All right, Allen, whatever. Go inside.
Bye, Sheila!
night! - See you...See you, Terry!
Bye, Sheila.
I don't know if he heard me. Bye, Terry!
Bye, Sheila!
well, here she is. They left her under an overpass for the night.
you find anything?
Yeah. We found a lot of stuff.
from bodily fluid and hair samples, we determined that a bunch of old, homeless dudes had an orgy in the car.
Oh, God. - Yeah.
you know what that's called when they do that in there?
that's called a soup kitchen.
it's pretty rough stuff.
not long after that, a mama raccoon came along and gave birth on the floor.
placenta blew out all over the back window there.
Yeah, and then to top it all off, some joker comes along takes himself a nifty little dump in the driver's seat.
I think he knew you guys were cops, because this is what I would call a spite shit.
you were able to determine all of that from the hair and fluid samples? - Oh, yeah.
what about fingerprints? You find any fingerprints?
Nope, couldn't get a one. - Found a cell phone.
Yeah, that's mine.
any signs of a struggle or spent shells?
no. Believe me, everybody that was in on this orgy was more than willing.
in fact, they even left you a note here.
thanks for the F-shack. Love, Dirty Mike and the boys.
here's something we found.
we found about a dozen unscratched lottery tickets.
no fingerprints or nothing. Check that out.
Yeah, it's a real shame, you know.
I got myself a Prius. It's a hell of a machine.
it's my first brand-new car. I've never owned a new car.
found a deer vagina.
what? - Thought it was human lips at first.
then we took a closer look. It was definitely a deer vagina.
not even a free ticket.
what are we gonna do?
we got no fingerprints, a bunch of losing lottery tickets.
look at this, there's a two-minute phone call made after we were jumped.
they used your phone? - They ghost dialed.
someone probably sat on it.
it could have recorded some of their conversation when Ershon got grabbed.
we gotta hear the other side of that call.
Nope, no, it's nothing.
nothing? - It's nothing.
it's the only lead we have. - It's nothing.
why did you just get super jumpy?
what?
it's an ex-girlfriend, okay?
what's the matter? What happened with you guys?
allen, it's the only lead we have.
we either go with this or we walk away from this case right now.
fine. Let's go see her.
Hello, Christinith.
Hello, Allen.
that's my partner, Terry. - Hi, Telly.
holy shit. Dude. - Just relax, relax.
I waited for you in Tower Records for four hours.
that was 13 years ago.
arnold Palmer alert. Arnold Palmer alert.
who wants some Arnie Palmies?
sweetie, this one has the vodky, right here.
Hal, just place it down, please. - All righty.
okay.
I did things in bed with you that I haven't done with anyone since.
no.
Christinith, your husband, it's awkward.
Oh, no, he knows all of this.
you're a lucky dog. - It's true.
Christine, this is a lovely house.
it's Christinith. Are you stupid, or are you deaf?
Christinith, you idiot!
you come to our house, you get my wife's name right!
what? - Christinith!
look, we really appreciate the hospitality.
we'd just love to get the message off your cell phone.
we believe it might give us information regarding a kidnapping.
okay. Why don't you come to the kitchen, and I will let you listen to it and everyone else stay here.
okay, sweetie. - Come on.
there's my phone. - Great, thank you for...
I hate you, you son of a bitch!
you're so strong. - I'm stronger than you will ever know!
I hate you! I hate you!
you're so adorable. Look at your face. Look at your face.
you go, "I love you. " Say it. "I love you, Cwistinith."
you probably think because of the beard that I'm really hairy.
but I'm not.
shaved.
Allen! - He's fine.
question.
what would you rather be, a bear or a dog?
I don't care. - I wanna be a bear dog. Half dog, half bear.
cause that way, I could live in the house but I still get to make a doodie out in the woods.
Allen!
Allen! Allen!
this is police evidence. Terry! Let's go! - Hey!
you get back here and you make love to my wife!
Allen! Allen!
I don't get it, man. I just do not get it.
I mean, that girl Christinith was seriously hot.
your wife is crazy hot.
I mean, even that Brazilian security chick, she threw you a "Do me" vibe.
what is it with you and hot ladies?
first off, my wife is cute, but she's not hot.
dude, you're insane. Your wife is scalding hot.
you wanna listen to this message or not? - Yeah, whatever.
you have one job, mate.
find a sucker to invest with you so you can pay my boss back the money you lost.
and I don't care who.
right. I actually think I found a sucker...
he's talking to Ershon... to invest $32 billion.
who's got $32 billion to rob?
once I get the money, I'll falsify the records to show their massive losses and then repay your employer.
now, since you're following me, I need to go to 2300 Park Avenue, and after that...
I told you it wasn't a security team.
he was being abducted. - Obviously, but what kind... holy...
nobody leaves our house without making love to my wife!
is that him? - Yeah!
Oh, my God, they came out of nowhere!
holy shit! - They chased us 20 miles.
you come back here! You get back here! - Allen!
2300 Park Avenue. It's the offices of the lottery.
holy shit, the lottery tickets we found.
Ershon is using the lottery money to cover his losses.
$32 billion. That's the state's money.
well, what do we tell Mauch? A guy lost some money.
we have a scratchy cell phone message and an address.
it's still half a case.
there's gotta be some sort of paper trail.
if we can find that, if we can track it, then we can go to Mauch.
so, I did some more research on Ershon's accounting firm, and I found some pretty interesting stuff.
hold on, I'm up.
I gave my love to Erin
she promised to be true
I went to war to come back
and find five British soldiers had their way with her
it was consensual
done?
Gretchel and Dawson Accounting Firm in Fair Lawn, New Jersey has only one client, David Ershon.
pretty rinky-dink operation for a guy like that.
looks like we're going to Jersey to visit an accounting firm.
that's a shitty day.
and all their fathers were hanged
and the children all got pink eye while their Harry Potter books were burned
do you have fun singing those songs? They're really depressing.
I do. They're full of rich history.
damn it, I'm late. I was supposed to go meet my lady.
I thought you said you guys split up.
let's just keep our thing about work, okay?
all right. Goodbye, buddy.
Hey, get off me, man.
what the hell are you doing?
I'm dancing, Terry. What the hell are you doing here?
I love you, Francine.
if you were with me, you wouldn't be here in this strip club, shaking it for dollar bills!
this is a ballet studio, Terry. Okay? These poles are horizontal.
he loves you very much, Francine.
who is this guy? - What are you doing here, Allen?
I'm here to support a friend and a work colleague.
Francine, is this guy bothering you?
who's this, your new boyfriend? Great. You got a new boyfriend.
he is my dance partner, Terry. Okay?
I know that this is a big surprise, but there are other things in the world besides being a cop. Okay?
now, if you will excuse me, I'm gonna dance.
what, you don't think I can do this shit?
that was surprisingly good, Terry.
I love you, Francine. - You don't know what love is.
he loves you very much, Francine!
I heard it when he said it. Thank you.
you know what you're doing to me? You're killing me inside.
and don't eyeball me, man!
you're running around with this crack-dealing drug addict?
Terry!
he does not approve of your behavior!
can you please go?
and you, too, creepy guy standing in the door?
let's go, Allen.
I think we all experienced our own ballet today.
the ballet of emotion and feelings.
you're kind of making things worse.
you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
Hey, I didn't know you could dance.
we used to do those dance moves to make fun of guys when we were kids, show them how queer they were, okay?
you learned to dance like that sarcastically? - Yeah, I guess.
stay out of my personal life, okay? The kid flies private.
stay focused on the case, man. I'll see you in Jersey tomorrow.
all right, Terry.
Hey, that was liberating for me. I don't know how it felt for you.
here, check this out. Article from six months ago.
talking about how the lottery is looking to invest their $30-billion fund more aggressively.
so he's dealing drugs?
no, it's not drugs. This isn't Miami Vice.
look, I'm sorry. I just...
I am in a bit of a state today. Sheila and I got into it last night.
what happened?
she was interested in taking this class at The Learning Annex, right?
called "The Art of Oral Sex"?
you know, we just don't have it in the budget right now.
it's always about her.
Yeah, that's... that's messed up.
Hey, I got you a gift.
I just saw something, and I thought of you, and so, I don't want it to be weird.
I just wanted to be nice.
of course it's weird.
it's a grown man giving another man a present.
there you go. Open it up.
it's okay, you're welcome.
I like to do things like that.
take a look what it says.
female Body Inspector.
you know, because we're both in law enforcement.
we both like women.
but I got a weird sense of humor. I'm a sick puppy.
I can't look at it. It makes me laugh so hard.
me, too.
real nice. You know, it's all class.
okay. - Don't do that shit any more.
Yeah, believe me, I won't.
do you understand what's so funny about it, though?
cause it's the FBI, right? It has the same logo, the same shield.
and at first glance, you're like, it's just a mug that says "FBI.
but then at second glance, you're like, "Female Body Inspector"?
get out of town. This is outrageous...
shut up!
I'm gonna climb over that anger wall of yours one of these days, and it's gonna be glorious.
shouldn't we tell Mauch that we're going to check this place out?
for what? We're just going to check it out.
I know, but it's procedure.
Terry answers to no one.
I do what I do.
what accounting firm is closed at 11: 00 a.m. on a Tuesday?
this is a shithole.
I love bombs.
I can't hear! I can't hear!
there's blood blisters on my hands!
Oh, my God!
how do they walk away in movies without flinching when it explodes behind them?
there's no way! I call bullshit on that!
when they flew the Millennium Falcon outside of the Death Star, and it was followed by the explosion, that was bullshit!
don't you dare badmouth Star Wars! That was all accurate!
I need an MRI.
I need an MRI! I've got soft tissue damage.
there's no way I don't have soft tissue damage.
please stop.
I just wanna go somewhere and breastfeed right now!
fire Department said it was a gas leak, but no way. That was timed.
they didn't wanna kill us, but they wanted to scare us.
Yeah, well, they succeeded, okay?
I'm tired of this. All right?
I'm tired of explosions and people pointing guns at me.
I wanna go back to my desk.
guess what? Life gets loud sometimes and messes with your ears.
you can't escape it by hiding at your desk for your whole life.
you know what? Yes, you can. I've done it for years, okay?
there's no explosions at my desk.
there's no explosions at my home with my plain wife, in my plain house.
what are you afraid of, man?
I'm your partner. You can tell me. What the hell are you hiding from?
I was a sophomore in college.
the university I went to decided they needed to raise tuition.
a classmate of mine, Brenda, in an effort to raise money and stay in school, came up with a nifty plan where she thought she'd date guys and charge them money.
I go on dates all the time, with a whole bunch of, you know, boys and stuff.
and I kind of need somebody to help me out, like, you know, my partner in crime.
Yeah, I could make a schedule.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I was thinking.
provide transportation services. - Yeah, yeah.
it's gonna be a good time. - Thanks so much for asking me.
she said she needed my help to make sure that the dates went okay and that the guys paid her. She said she'd give me a percentage.
Oh, my God. You were a pimp. - What? God, no.
no, I was just trying to help a friend.
we started making a lot of money.
and wouldn't you know it, some of Brenda's girlfriends decided they wanted to be a part of it.
pretty soon, there were about 14 ladies that I was protecting while they gave me money.
that's called a stable of whores.
we decided I shouldn't use my real name.
so we came up with the name "Gator.
I'm telling you, you were a pimp.
No! Are you even listening to the story?
anyway, one day, I wake up and I look in the mirror, and I don't like what I see.
I mean, I had gotten out of control, and I didn't even realize it.
you can't have a conscience in the pimp game.
one night, two of my favorite girls,
candy and Jolene, said, "We gotta take you in,
and they dropped me off at the emergency room.
that's where I met Sheila. I was a mess.
I made a promise to myself and to her that I would never get out of control again.
so, as soon as I graduated from college,
I became an accountant for the police department.
the most stable job I could think of.
an accountant for law and order.
I just don't wanna ever feel out of control like that ever again.
don't worry. I got your back.
now I say we go get in Ershon's grill and see if he cracks.
I'm tired of all this tippy-toeing around. - Okay.
you can either walk the plank or take your panties off.
the choice is yours.
I want to take my panties off.
you've made a wise choice, you have.
Mr. Ershon, Detective Gamble and the officer who shot Derek Jeter are here.
gentlemen, please.
remember us, hotshot? - Of course I do. Please sit.
there she blows.
two of those Russian waters, please. No lime wedges, just cucumber.
guess where we just came from? An explosion at your accounting office.
Yes, that awful gas leak.
gas leak?
the only gas leak is the one coming out of your mouth right now.
I just thank God no one was hurt or injured in a bad way.
I absolutely abhor death.
Hey, Andrew Lloyd Webber. The jig is up, okay?
we know that wasn't your security team that grabbed you.
and we know you're targeting a big fish to cover losses.
you talk or I beat you so it don't show no bruises.
God, this water is good. Terry, have you tried the water? - Shut up, Allen
I assure you I have no idea what you're talking about
I understand there was a bit of a mix-up with the whole scaffolding business.
the cucumber accents the water in such a way that...
perhaps by way of apology,
I can offer you my personal courtside seats for the Knicks game, with access to the Ambassador Club.
come on, Knicks! Come on!
I got Knicks' fever and it's catching!
Hey. This feels weird sitting here. It feels like it's a bribe.
it is a bribe. Son-of-a-bitch, I saw courtside and I went blind.
come on call me
excuse me. - That was a trick.
no more
gentlemen, you have a choice. Mamma Mia or Jersey Boys.
fantastic! You're so unbelievable!
damn it. He did it again.
excuse me. - No more tickets.
Mr. Ershon, I tried to keep them in the waiting room.
that's okay, Susan. Two Glacier waters with Mediterranean limes.
no, no, no. No more water. We're not here for that.
no, I was very much looking forward to having a water.
how great is Jersey Boys? - It's not great. It's fantastic!
you totally undersold it. The pageantry, the costumes.
wow, what a musical.
Hey. Get over here.
what's wrong with you? - What?
that's not what we're here for.
we're gonna do good cop, bad cop. Okay?
it's the oldest game in the book for a reason, it works.
I come strong, then you come in.
you got it? - Yeah.
I come strong, then you come in. - Right. Got it.
now you listen to me, you piece of shit.
it's just you and me, and I'm gonna rip you apart!
how did you cover your losses up?
what drug cartel are you working with now?
okay, I'll talk to you, you're reasonable! - No, no, look at me!
you wanna talk to me? You wanna talk to me?
allen, what are you doing? What are you doing? Allen!
I'm gonna make you eat a plate of human shit!
get away from me!
where is he?
look, I'm really sorry about that.
I saw how aggressive you were being, and I thought, "Wow, I gotta go even bigger than that," since we're doing bad cop, bad cop.
what? No, I said, "Good cop, bad cop. " I'm the bad cop, you're the good cop.
okay, then there it is.
that's it. I thought you said, "Bad cop, bad cop."
well, while you were going crazy, look what I snagged from his desk.
think it's his phone sheet. - Nice.
seven calls to the lottery office.
that could be the evidence we need for Mauch.
get back. Colombian drug lords. - Where are you getting that from?
Jeesus
can you imagine where you'd be in your career if you hadn't shot Jeter?
we call this in, right?
looks like we got all the evidence we need.
I'm sorry, my butterfly.
we'll load them up, send them back to go.
holy shit. - What?
what do you mean, what? Where are we?
we're in the high desert.
they took my shoes again, man! What the hell is it with taking shoes?
they took your wooden gun? - Yeah.
Hello? - Hello, Gene? I mean, Captain.
captain, it's Allen Gamble.
Yeah, yeah. Where are you? What's going on?
captain, it's a long story, but I'm just gonna cut to the chase.
we are in Las Vegas, all right?
we were kidnapped, put on a freight train, and shipped out here.
let me just stop you right there. Don't bullshit me.
captain, I am being straight with you.
look, we think something's going on, okay?
we think Ershon is targeting the lottery to cover his losses.
wait. How many times did I explicitly say to you, "Lay off Ershon"?
Terry, Captain wants to know how many times has he asked us to lay off of Ershon.
twice.
twice. Terry says twice. I agree.
I'm hanging up. I'm done.
I gotta tell you, I started getting a hand for that, a taste for that Pai Gow.
martin and Fosse, super cops, in three, two...
so, we busted that junkie. Got back 74 thou in diamonds. 74 thou.
solved the Castien case.
$74, 000? That's all they took?
there's millions of dollars of diamonds in that place.
how about this, Gamble? How about you shut your face?
all right? Just shut it.
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain's looking for you.
I know it's off the subject, but is Kevlar copyrighted?
captain? - Yeah.
is it a bad time? - No, come on. Come on.
not me, right? - Yeah, and you.
fellows, I'm sure you're familiar with the venerable DA Radford.
he wanted to come down and pay us a visit.
Hello, gentlemen.
Hello, sir. - Hey.
you know, I was talking to Gene here. - He prefers "Captain."
Yes, I was talking to Gene here, and, you know, it's funny.
I don't know what you two have been up to, but I've been getting calls from people I don't ever get calls from.
in 40 years of enforcing the law, I've learned one thing.
when that happens, stop.
gene, how's the family? Good, good, Louis, thanks for asking.
my son's bisexual, so... - Tremendous.
gentlemen, do we understand each other?
cut the crap! - Will do.
guy never comes down here.
twenty years, I think I've seen that guy in this building one time.
he's a heavyweight cat, that guy. - He was sitting right here.
Yeah. I think you missed the point. Anyway, look.
blue and white found your firearms down by the Hudson River.
here you go, Terry.
you know what?
I'm gonna hang on to the wooden gun.
to give me back my real gun? - No.
cause I'm gonna give you this.
it's a rape whistle. You blow that if you run into any trouble and someone with an actual gun will come and help you out.
we were abducted, Captain! This shit is real!
Ershon's dirty. He's targeting the lottery!
next, I want you guys to hand in all the evidence you think you have to the SEC.
the financial district's under their jurisdiction.
don't you get it? This case is talking to us!
I'm a peacock, Captain! You gotta let me fly on this one!
you know what, Terry? Let's just settle this. Peacocks don't fly.
they fly, they fly a little bit. - Yeah, about as much as a penguin.
one more thing, do me a favor, don't go chasing waterfalls.
was that accidental, or were you trying to quote TLC on purpose?
I don't even understand the reference.
you don't understand what you said? - I don't know what that is.
get out. - Go.
how did they get that story?
I'm tired of being treated like a jerk for trying to do the right thing.
Hey, guys.
there's a proxy vote for a big reinvestment of the pension coming up, so if you just wanna come by the old... Damn it, Bob!
let me ask you something.
what do you even do around here besides interrupt people?
well, I serve as treasurer to the union.
I make a wicked pot of decaf.
Exactly! You're a worthless piece of shit!
probably right, Terry. That's why I feel so sad all the time.
I'm gonna go for a walk.
Bob! - Say something.
come on! Bob!
I didn't mean it, all right? I'm upset.
actually, we don't do that here. This is an installation art piece.
this coffee table? - Yes. We don't put drinks on it.
five hundred thousand? - He can read! Congratulations.
what? - I'm sorry, are you in the right place?
or not? I'm...
Terry. - Does he... Okay.
well... - Sorry. Terry! What are you doing here?
I want to be with you. - No, Terry, that's not gonna happen.
you know where you belong. On top of me in the Poconos.
instead, you're here selling dirty coffee tables?
I mean, look at this. This is nonsense!
Terry, this is an original Haverfield-Jameson.
the chaos of the coffee table? It represents our fractured egos.
you think I don't know about this artsy-fartsy crap?
this coffee table isn't the ego.
it represents our shattered sense of community in the face of capitalist-driven isolation.
looks like the work of Cindy Sherman or Frank Stella.
how did you know that, Terry?
I took some classes at RISD so I could make fun of these lame artsy douches in my neighborhood.
Terry, lower your voice! - I don't have to lower my voice.
is this man bothering you?
are you actually having sex with this creep?
Terry, he's gay. Okay?
he's even wearing a T-shirt that says, "I'm gay"!
all right? And also, he is my boss.
happy for you, man. Good.
can you get out of here now? I'm talking to my lady.
Mr. Reger, everything is fine. Terry is actually leaving now.
nice toot, sailor. - Jesus.
Terry, what are you doing?
look, I waited three years for you to be more than a cop, okay?
just give me one more year.
Terry, you don't get another year. I'm done.
fine.
Terry, don't touch that! Terry! - Oh, my God!
I don't need this shit. I don't need you!
and when you call me, I'm not coming back!
I'll burn this bitch down to the ground!
fresh! Energetic! - I love his rawness!
stop critiquing me, okay? I'm a human being! I'm not a piece of art!
Yes, you are. - Bravo!
I'm a peacock flying into a rainbow!
Yes! Yes!
these braised short ribs taste like a dog's asshole.
sweetie. - You know what, I'm sitting here thinking, "Who in the world would slow roast a dog's asshole "and serve it to their husband?
you would. You are being awful. What's wrong?
captain took us off the case. - I'm sorry.
I told Terry about my dark days in college, and it brought up some feelings.
well, honeydick, that was a long time ago.
you're not that same person you were.
no, you don't get it. There is a darkness inside of me.
it wants to get out. It wants to walk around.
it wants some walking around money, and it wants to buy some shoes.
and it wants to walk up with the people and say, "Hey, Gator don't play no shit."
you feel me? - Yeah.
gator never been about that, never been about playing no shit.
sweetie, I'm sorry. - It's okay.
I just... - Remember that night we met?
the attending physician told me, "We got a drugged-out pimp in the back."
and I went back there, and I pulled open that curtain,
you were weak, scared, ass up, inflamed, crying.
at that moment, I knew.
Hey, he's no pimp. Pimps don't cry.
pimps don't cry
pimps don't cry
no, they do not
they don't shed a tear
pimps don't cry
they never shed a tear
come lay with me.
be safe, and let's make love. Come on.
every time you say, "Be safe," it tears me apart.
you gotta let me be who I'm gonna be.
allen, I'm pregnant.
whose baby is that?
who's the man who did that to you?
gator's bitches better be using jimmies!
I'm sorry. See, that's what I'm talking about.
Oh, my God.
you need to leave.
get out! Get out, Allen! Get out!
hey
Hey. What are you doing here?
come here when I have lady troubles, which means I come here about every night.
what are you doing here?
Sheila and I got into it tonight.
she threw me out.
well, you're not a cop till your wife throws you out of the house, partner.
does it bother you that the Castien robbers only took 74 grand in diamonds?
they're junkies. Who cares? I mean...
I don't know if a junkie can go down a 20-story zipline, though.
how are you going?
we're about to have us a little screw party in this red Prius over here if you wanna join us.
you're not going anywhere near that Prius, okay?
here's what we're talking about. We're talking about a bunch of hobos with fingers in each other's pooper in a stranger's car with talk radio playing really loud.
it's gonna be a nice evening.
well, we're not participating in that. We have no interest.
let me rephrase it.
we got a jar of old mustard, and we got a poodle, and we're just get in there and we're gonna put some D's in some A's.
Hey, are you Dirty Mike and the boys?
how do you know who we are? - You left a note in that car.
police, shithead. - He's a copper. We gotta go. Come on!
Hey! Goose it, boys! They're cops!
rub your dicks on the car as you're running away!
you turned my beautiful Prius into a nightmare!
we are gonna have sex in your car! It will happen again!
I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight.
fortunately, I know where you're gonna be drinking.
Jack of All Trades. Drinks on me. Come on.
no, I already have a beer. - No, no, no, no.
I'm talking about doing some serious drinking.
drinking with Terry Hoitz.
this sucks, man. Work our ass off on this case, now we gotta hand over all of our evidence?
Yeah, it's not right.
Oh, my God, I'm hungover.
so, you guys are law enforcement?
Yeah, we're an independent government agency who, along with the FBI and the Federal Reserve, regulate the stock market and corporate fraud.
and the Federal Reserve is a prison?
no, basically, it's a held-for-profit bank that sets interest rates and loans money to other banks.
is that a wastebasket? - Yeah, right there.
thank you.
you all right? - Holy hell!
I'm so sorry.
I got so drunk last night.
I think I thought a tube of toothpaste was astronaut food.
come on in, fellas.
you gotta be kidding me. You're Ershon's lawyer.
we're turning over our investigation to you?
let me assure you there will be no conflict of interest between me and David Ershon.
and if this were an actual investigation,
I would immediately recuse myself.
this is all the evidence we have, and I truly hope you take this seriously.
Yes. Very much so.
from everything I've heard, I understand you guys are the best at these types of investigations.
outside of Enron and AIG and Bernie Madoff,
worldcom, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers.
okay. Thank you. Thank you, Detective.
would you like a seat, or you're fine? - No, I'm good.
okay. Let me just assure you fellas,
david Ershon is an upstanding citizen.
I am playing squash with him tonight at the club, and we're having dinner.
you listen to me, you Windsor knot-wearing monkey, you play squash with Ershon, right?
your kids go to school with his?
how would you know if he's clean or not?
I will take a look at your evidence, and I will take a second look at the financials.
and when I come back and bust your ass, we're locking David Ershon in the Federal Reserve!
he still doesn't understand the concept.
what are you doing?
we just handed all of our evidence over to the bad guy's lawyer!
are you a big man, huh?
I'm talking to you. - What?
you wake up in the morning, you say, "I'm putting on my big boy pants"?
look, I'm wearing a belt!
"I've got big boy pants on!" - No!
you borrow a little jacket, you go?
you take your lunch 'cause you got big boy pants on?
you got your big boy pants and your snack?
I could say big, loud things!
I could be demonstrative!
stop! We don't, we don't do this!
you're scaring the shit out of me, man! Stop it!
is this how you conduct yourself? In a democracy?
what the hell are you doing, man?
I'm so tired of you getting angry and yelling all the time.
it's exhausting.
I feel like I'm partners with the Hulk.
you wanna know why I'm so angry all the time?
cause the more I try and do right, the more I screw things up.
we've got a possible jumper at 3 World Financial Center, 23rd floor.
all units, fire department.
sec. Beaman's office.
we have to go.
but the Captain. - We have to go, Allen.
all units, I need a respondent.
possible jumper, 3 World Financial Center.
shit. It's Beaman!
he's gotta know something. Wesley!
detective Hoitz and Gamble. We got this.
I took an online class at University of Phoenix on negotiating.
I'm gonna need a priest and a bullhorn.
I got no bullhorn. Does anyone have a bullhorn?
bullhorn, anyone? - Truck.
police business. I need to use your PA system.
okay, let me turn it on.
Mr. Beaman? Mr. Don Beaman?
it's Wesley. I know Ershon's Wesley's...
look, there's a lot to live for in this life.
a lot of great things, like soda pop, big fresh can of soda pop.
they do not care!
give me this. I know how to talk to him.
listen, we all know you're a scumbag, and nobody cares about you.
rotten piece of shit.
that's worse than what I was saying.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Don.
people down here are starting to murmur that you don't have the balls to do it.
I don't care! - Yeah.
I say you can do it.
I mean, I don't want you to jump.
I'm just saying you have the capability.
look, he's flying!
stop that.
half empty bottle of gin. Chair knocked over.
look at this, it's a clear sign of a struggle.
make sure you get this, all right?
detectives, all your work's done here. You can go.
what about Ershon targeting the lottery?
you know why Ershon was calling down to the lottery offices all those times?
because he was hooking up with the Powerball girl, the one on TV with all the numbered balls.
Yeah. She filed a restraining order on him last week.
it was right there in front of you the whole time.
can't be. You guys are getting transferred.
what? Traffic.
Yeah, that's right.
you, you're gonna walk a beat downtown.
you're gonna walk a beat downtown.
it's done. No. Captain, what are you talking about?
no, no. It's done.
save yourselves some gas. Captain!
is there an appeal process we can...
had to do what you had to do, Captain.
Wow! That hurt.
excuse me. Where's my car? - They towed it.
couple of homeless people were messing around in it.
that's an official police car. Could have fooled me.
wow, Mauch was upset, huh?
Really?
the only thing I had to be proud of in my life was being a detective.
that was all I had. Now it's gone.
I know. I know. You still got me.
don't you get it? I don't want you, Allen, okay? I never did.
I told you that scaffolding violation was dogshit.
I can't believe you still doubt me after everything we've seen.
it's a real case, and I'm a real cop.
we just got the wrong target for Ershon.
you carry a rape whistle. - This is real cop work.
there is nothing about you that makes a man a man, okay?
you got no gun, no car, no wife, and now you got no partner.
leave me alone.
a mutt case.
Terry, I am a cop, for your information, okay?
a broken partnership.
I'm a cop!
and getting busted down to a shitty assignment.
allen and Terry hit the trifecta.
but sometimes when you get your ass kicked, that's when you find out what's real and what needs doing.
whether it's directing traffic...
come on!
or cracking a multibillion dollar fraud.
do you work here? - Yeah, I do.
the wrecking ball that crashed into Castien down there.
they also did damage to your office?
some police officers came by and sealed it off.
do you recall what they looked like?
one of them had an Australian accent.
you don't happen to do any business for the state lottery, do you?
no. Our main client is Lendl Global.
can I ask what this is about?
traffic ENFORCER OF THE MONTH
Terry Hoitz
gator needs his gat, you punkass bitch!
cause that's what a real cop is.
no, I didn't say "Lock her up. " I never said, "Lock her upz."
a guy who does what needs to be done.
a guy who knows how to use his dark side for good.
and then you move to Florida.
one, two, three, attack!
Terry, it's me.
tap out. Tap out. - It's me, Allen.
are you tapping out, or are you hitting me in the face?
I'm tapping out!
you crazy? What are you doing, man?
they might be watching us. - Could've killed you.
turn out the lights. - What?
they could be watching us. - Who?
I found some big information, okay?
about what? - Some scary shit, Terry. This is big.
how'd you get in here? This place is foolproof.
we can't be too careful. - What are you talking about?
this place might be bugged. - There's no bugs in here.
first off, I missed you.
what's going on? - Did you hear what I said?
fine, I kind of missed you, too. - Thank you.
okay. I found out whose losses Ershon has to cover.
it's Lendl Global. - What?
Lendl staged the Castien robbery as a distraction so they could break into their own accounting firm next door.
they then altered all the records to cover the losses that Ershon had cost them through all of his bad investments.
you're not supposed to be doing this.
you're supposed to be walking the beat.
I know. Pretty tricky, though, huh?
this is bad, Allen. This is bad.
no wonder the captain wanted us to stay out of this.
Yeah, I bet Beaman started asking questions.
that's why they killed him. - Man.
here's the other thing.
tomorrow, there's a massive business deal going down.
Ershon's leading it.
I still can't figure out who the poor sucker is they're making the deal with, but we gotta stop it.
it's time to let the peacock fly.
I'm not going, Allen. I like what I do.
so do I. We're cops.
no. I like what I do now. I like working traffic. It's a great gig.
what?
I like working traffic. I'm not going with you.
what is this traffic bullshit?
what are you talking about? - I'm talking about my life.
the corner I run on 54th and 3rd Avenue? It hums.
it's Terry's intersection. And the traffic guys? They're good guys.
there's this one guy, Phillip? He can pee in the urinal from 20 feet.
you've gotta see it, Allen. You've got to.
what happened to you? What happened to this being our time?
no way, Allen. I'm out. I'm done.
get in the car. - Come on, Allen. We both know it's wooden.
apartment pop. Now get in the car. - You're not gonna shoot me.
okay, I'll be honest. This is only the second time I've ever fired this.
so stop pointing it at me.
look, tomorrow morning, all I know is I'm going to Mauch, all right?
for what? He doesn't care.
he's been dodging this case for too long and I want answers.
I want him to look me in the eye and tell me why.
turn on the news, man. Nobody cares.
I hope I'm not alone.
hope you bring it.
we got a big day out there. Big one.
we got a full moon. People are gonna be amped, all right?
let's see what we got on hot tips, all right?
the new bathmats are in.
one more thing. We got a serial rapist in Crown Heights.
jeez, I'm sorry. That's from my other job. Ignore that. Forget that.
well, don't ignore it.
if you live in Crown Heights, you know, walk in pairs.
gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.
gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.
I gotta go. Go get 'em. Let's be careful out there.
the oak.
I like to keep the oak together and the maple separately, okay?
and these chopping boards?
Hey, Captain.
Hey, Allen. Hey, how you doing?
what are you doing here? Are you here for the bathmats?
I need you to be straight with me. - Straight with us.
Hey, Terry. Look at this.
I thought you were working traffic today. - Let them block the box.
besides, partners' code, right? - Thanks.
Hey, why have you worked your ass off trying to kill this case?
all right, fine. I'm gonna tell you guys something.
you really went into deep water on this one. You really went in deep.
Ershon's connected to all the higher ups, and I gotta save what little ass I have left, okay?
you keep hiding from shit in the world, and eventually the world comes to your front door.
nice. That's very nice.
I heard it in an episode of Touched By An Angel.
you keep this thing real quiet, and you make sure you have real evidence, and maybe I'll see what I can do.
but if you make a lot of noise and you attract the media attention, and you bring the DA in on this,
I am out, okay?
Yeah, we'll go in there like church mice.
but there's one case, one case in a career where you go all in. This is it.
all right. Then you do us proud.
cause I don't want no scrubs.
Really? - No.
you're not aware that's a TLC song?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
second time. You said chasing waterfalls, now you're saying you don't want no scrubs.
I don't even understand the reference. - It's like a tic.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
remember, this thing gets messy, we never talked.
you can trust us. - Real quiet.
you gotta creep. Creep.
come on.
you don't say "Creep-creep" unless you're quoting TLC.
Hey, guys.
you know Danson and Highsmith were not good cops, right?
Yeah, I guess we kind of knew that, but it's a drag.
I mean, at a certain point, who's left to be a hero?
not to be corny, maybe it's you guys.
you ready?
yeah.- Let's go.
no, but the highlights are great. - Thank you.
sexy but serious. - Thank you.
excuse me.
who the hell are all these people? I was only expecting one man.
you know, they're just some people I owe money to who wanted to be here.
who are they?
well, they are some Chechen patriots, entrepreneurs.
and the black chaps are some businessmen from Nigeria.
you owe money to the Nigerians and Chechens?
Yes. Yes, I do.
you're a piece of work. - Thank you.
probably best to get started.
this is good, baby. We're in the game, we know the score.
the only thing that bugs me is we still don't know who Ershon's targeting.
is it the lotto? Who is it?
who cares? Some rich prick.
I have to tell you, I am tremendously excited by this deal.
and I can assure you that every dime of your money will be invested with the utmost diligence.
your rates of return are really exciting.
we think our members are gonna be just thrilled.
Yeah. I mean, we've averaged, like, 18% over the last 10 years.
all right. Quiet as a church mouse, in and out.
I can feel that tingling in my balls you were talking about.
beautiful.
all right, listen up.
I am Detective Gamble. This is Detective Hoitz.
we need your cooperation.
david Ershon.
you're under arrest for fraud, embezzlement, and in connection to the murder of Don Beaman.
this is a bad idea.
Hey, guys.
Bob? What are you doing here?
I'm investing.
do you remember we talked about that proxy vote a while back?
this is what it was for. - Holy shit.
it's a more aggressive investment strategy for the pension.
Allen! We're the suckers. They're targeting the police pension fund.
gentlemen, you're here illegally and without a warrant.
we are within our rights to take action.
so much for quiet as church mice!
go!
who the hell are those guys?
gentlemen,
I can get you obstructed view tickets for Rock of Ages.
even I admit that's not very tempting, but I'm not made of tickets, God damn it!
get in the front! - How do you start this freaking thing?
go on! Go!
shit! Go!
Oh, my...
Jeanie! Get over here! You, go get the bloody car!
hold the wheel!
open the back! - I got it. I got it!
they're gonna kill me. And then they will kill you.
well, I'm gonna kill you first! - And then they will kill me.
we have two rogue police officers. They are armed and dangerous, and holding David Ershon hostage. - Stupid pricks!
it's us, we're good guys! - Exactly. They're the good guys.
where do we go? Where do we go?
I have a small apartment. No one knows about it.
I use it mainly for my parents and prostitutes.
not at the same time. That would be wrong.
let's hear it from the top, every detail.
I think the best way to tell the story is by starting at the end, briefly, then going back to the beginning, and then periodically returning to the end, maybe giving different characters' perspectives throughout.
just to give it a bit of dynamism, otherwise, it's just sort of a linear story.
just tell us what happened.
I lost a bunch of money from some people and now they want it back.
what about Don Beaman?
beaman knew that I had falsified my financials, so they sent down Wesley to try and keep him quiet.
he forced him at gunpoint to drink a bunch of gin and then forced him onto the ledge.
it was only a matter of time before he fell.
at least we stopped you from getting the pension fund.
well, but, yeah, but you didn't. It's already in my account.
by 9: 00 in the morning, it goes into the Lendl equity fund and from there it's transferred to a dozen offshore accounts.
by 9: 01, it's gone.
well, what if we stop the transfer? - But you can't.
what if we stop the transfer?
you'd have to be at Endemic Bank for 9: 00 exactly, find the clerk, get the routing number.
we gotta stop it.
there's no way.
every cop, the crazy Australian and his crew, they'll all be after us.
you could let me go, and I'll give you $10 million each.
it's not a bribe. Of course it's a bribe.
you're offering to pay us money to not do our job.
it's not a bribe.
we hang low here tonight. Nobody knows about this place.
we'll be safe. And tomorrow, we hit it.
first things first, I gotta go see Sheila.
no way, it's too dangerous.
look, Terry, we don't know what's gonna happen to us tomorrow, but tonight, I need to make things right with Sheila.
all right, go. Go. Be careful.
Thanks, I will.
will you say hi to Sheila for me?
okay. - Okay.
tell her. Say Terry was asking about you.
he wants to make sure you know that he'll be there for you if anything happens.
Yeah. - Drop of a hat, I'm there.
look, it's starting to get a little weird, man.
if something happens to you, I need to be there to take care of her.
all of her wants, her needs, and desires are now my responsibility.
why do you say it like it's a predetermined thing?
just go, man.
okay. Thanks.
go.
Janeco Gallery.
Francine, it's Terry. Please don't hang up.
please pick up.
hello.
Hey, sweetie. I was praying you'd be at your mom's house.
you know what, I can't talk anymore. I think the phone's being tapped.
baby, where are you? I wanna see you.
I'm near the place where we did it three Halloweens ago.
do you remember?
okay, yeah, I got it.
I'm just warning you, though.
watch out. I think they're watching the house.
don't worry, sweetie. I think I have a way of talking to you.
I have to admit, I wasn't gonna come. I mean...
after all those years, after the restraining order.
I was worried I might not see you again.
there's some very dangerous people after him, and now they're after us.
it's just the old lady.
Hello, Allen.
Hello, Mama Ramos. What are you doing out here?
Sheila said she doesn't know what happened and she wants you back.
she also says... - Yes.
she wants you on top of her, holding her hair, and riding her like a bucking bronco while she sucks your thumb and says, "Mommy likey."
you, you tell your daughter...
he said he'll always love you.
and he's so happy that you're having his child.
Allen.
he also says that he wants you to stare into each other's eyes without blinking while you do it.
I love when we do that, Mom. And then afterward, lick the sex off each other.
I don't wanna do this.
you say things that are too personal.
okay, but just one more thing.
she said she loves you, and wants to hold your hand and have iced tea with you.
come on. That's not all she said.
no.
she says other things, but I don't want... - Please, please, please.
you don't realize, I may be killed tomorrow.
okay.
she says she wants to unplug all the clocks and the phones and have a three-day F marathon. - That's more like it. Yeah.
she wants to walk wrong for a week because you guys F'd so hard.
that's just lovely.
no more! He says things I can't say.
it involves a mannequin hand and an electric shaver taped to a golf club.
now what'd she say?
she says she loves you.
I'm so sorry about everything.
and I just had to come here tonight to tell you that I love you.
and the reason why I act like you're a plain wife is that
I'm afraid that if I admit to how stunning and intelligent and wonderful you are,
I'd just lose you. - Shut up, Allen. I love you.
we have a place that's safe. All right.
I'm gonna break your hip.
I'm about to do you grandpa-style.
I brought some music.
not what I would've chosen, but screw it.
all right. Let's go, Monday morning, time to go to work.
let's do it.
you want my gate code? Shut up, man!
that's Wesley!
Yes!
Where'd you learn to drive like that? - Grand Theft Auto!
shit, Allen, they're coming.
Oh, my God! - Shit.
do something, Allen! - Hold on, hold on.
someone's been playing Grand Theft Auto.
I did that!
I did that! - Oh, my God!
that's what I'm talking about! - We jackknifed them!
did you see that? It went backwards and then turned upside-down.
gator turns vans upside-down like they're in a crazy washing machine!
why are you calling yourself Gator?
it's a nickname I had in college. I used to run a dating service.
he was a pimp. - Yeah, I was. I was a pimp.
is it me or does it smell like deer vagina in here?
my poor car.
right now the streets are a bloodbath.
and, statistically speaking, there's about 30 kids in here, 10 of you are gonna be dead before your next birthday.
got a couple of tips, help you guys stay out of jail.
one, try your hardest to not be black or Hispanic.
it's a good tip. - Yeah. Two...
gentlemen, we got a hot one.
Hoitz and Gamble have Ershon hostage, high-speed car chase in progress.
Yes! Gun, gun!
pass up the guns. Pass them up. Let's go, people.
there we go. Anything, any Tasers? No?
good. Who wants to go on a ride-along?
I do!
all right, you, sweetie. Come on, let's go. Move.
move! Let's go. Come on!
cool, a helicopter! Must be covering the high-speed chase.
Jesus!
who are those guys? - They're Chechen investors.
we were gonna do a Chechen version of Dora the Explorer.
anyway, it went terribly wrong.
I feel like it's not fair that they have a helicopter!
Oh, no.
damn it.
watch your head. God, your hair is soft.
VO5 Hot Oil.
you're gonna wreck! There's cars coming from both directions!
I'm not gonna wreck!
I'm gonna wreck! You're right! - You want me to drive?
this was a very clever idea. - Yeah.
they're gone.
let's go.
they are Nigerians. Yeah, I'd forgotten about them.
this is a shortcut. - Are you kidding me?
you cannot go down there.
what are you doing?
hit him!
where are we? - Chelsea Pier.
what the hell?
Jesus!
them having a helicopter is definitely cheating.
go!
come on!
we're cops! Hit the chopper!
this is Martin and Fosse, en route.
back off! This is our collar!
set up a perimeter. No arrests until we get there!
take the light!
do not authorize that transfer.
this is David Ershon. The transfer is for him.
he will tell you not to authorize it, okay? Tell him.
tell him! - Yeah, do as they say. Stop the transfer.
approve it.
now.
do not touch anything!
I swear to God I'll blow your head all over this desk.
not a person in this room believes you'll shoot this clerk.
yeah?
thank you so much, gentlemen, for the prompt delivery of Mr. Ershon.
I have two competing bids from jilted investors.
they're at 30 million, and holding.
wait! Can't you let me... - Take him away.
but computers.
what if, one day, they were in charge?
now if you don't shut up, I will cut your ear off with a butter knife.
that's blunt. Blunt's worse than if it's sharp.
now!
you just stood there!
I didn't know that "now" meant that. How am I supposed to know that?
I knew what that meant. Shut up.
you kill us and you kill Ershon. You're out 30 million dollars.
who's got the golden goose now, huh? - Yeah.
shit!
he's still valuable with a bullet wound, mate.
he immediately called your bluff.
get up. And kill the police.
I just wanna make sure I get it right.
did you want this transfer approved or not approved?
you, mate, I'm gonna kill just for fun.
police, don't move! Drop your weapons!
drop it, or be dropped, homeboy!
I hope you like the taste of prison food and penis.
police! Down on the ground! Let me see your hands!
Hey, hey, you okay? Hey.
Hey, Gene. Captain. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. - That's okay. Don't worry about it.
you can call me Gene when we're not in the office.
okay. Thanks for coming by.
Attaboy.
come on, stay with me. Stay with me.
we're losing him! We're losing him! He's dying!
no. No, no, no, no. I'm just resting.
I'm just resting.
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you? - I'm just resting.
are you all right? - Just resting.
Hey, let me tell you something.
as far as paperwork goes, we'll take care of it.
you know why? - Why?
come on.
what? - It's not funny anymore.
I don't know what you're talking about. - TLC references.
still nothing. I swear to you.
I'm gonna go over and check on Terry.
I got a bad knee. Hold on. There you go.
it was the king of the mutt cases, but Allen and Terry had worked it like stars.
within 24 hours of learning about Ershon's scheme and Lendl's massive losses, the government issued TARP funds to bail out Lendl.
Lendl is in everything, and we're gonna go everywhere...
they were too big to fail.
Ershon now resides in Palomino Federal Correctional Facility in Florida.
he still invests. Currency's just different.
Roger Wesley was linked to the Beaman murder by security cam footage which Martin and Fosse hadn't checked.
it only showed the back of their heads.
but Allen's Faceback app was able to get a match to their faces.
Terry married Francine.
he played harp at the reception and it was beautiful.
he had learned how to play it in the eighth grade to make fun of the fairy that lived up the street.
Terry asked Sheila to be his best man, but she declined.
let's be honest, we all wanna be superstars and hotshots.
but guess what?
the people that do the real work, the ones that make the difference, you don't see them on TV or on the front page.
I'm talking about the day-in, day-outers, the grinders.
come on, man, you know who I'm talking about: The other guys.
see? That's a no-go. - Hey, hey.
you think you broke this Ershon case open?
you did nothing.
corporate lobbyists are spending millions to make sure guys like Ershon keep doing what they do.
Derek Jeter?
Yeah, it's me. You were set up that night you shot me, Terry.
I told you! - They knew by putting someone like you with a quick trigger finger next to that door where I do my pre-game walk, it'd end up bad. Bad for both of us.
now, I've been doing my own investigation on the banking industry, and I was close. I was real close.
so I forgive you, Terry.
I appreciate that, man. I'm sorry about what happened.
I'm glad you're doing better.
the whole damn system is clogged up with dirty money.
and the news doesn't say a word about it. 'Cause who owns them?
the same corporations that own the government.
courts and the law is all we have left.
so here's you guys' next case.
guy by the name of Carl Bachand, CEO of Killister Bank.
he took three billion in TARP funds.
he's crooked. He's real crooked.
take him down, but be careful. He's got Blackwater mercenaries 24l7.
Thanks, Derek.
Hey, Derek! Wait! What if we need to get in touch with you, get some more information or some tickets or something?
what just happened?
POWEREDY BY 100% VEGETABLE OIL
goldman Sachs. This case is gonna be nasty.
Hi. Cute glasses.
what was that? - What?
what? Dude, what is it with you and hot ladies? What's your secret?
honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about.
tell me who you lost your virginity to.
she actually became a TV actress. Heather Locklear.
Heather Locklear, what?
you've heard of her? - Come on!
she was much chubbier back then.
I don't get it. I really, I don't get it.
that was you. You don't have a sense of humor.
I do... I have a wonderful sense of humor.
if you say something funny, I'll laugh.
all right, I'm gonna tell you a great joke.
please. I love jokes.
all right. Little boy on his 13th birthday.
it's time to get laid. - Already feels inappropriate.
so he goes to the lady at the whorehouse, he goes, " Miss, "look, I know usually you want money, but I don't have any money and it's my birthday."
do you think I could have sex with you for this duck?
was he a farmer? - No.
that's probably a Health Code violation, bringing a duck into a place of prostitution.
they weren't gonna have sex with the duck!
no, I just mean Health Code violation to have the duck brought into a facility like that.
so, anyway, she says, "Yes, I'll do it."
so he goes in there, gives it to her.
he gives her what?
the high, hard one! She loves it.
she goes, " You know what"?
if you do that again, I'll give you your duck back.
it's like getting laid twice for free. - So... I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
the duck is payment for sexual intercourse. - Yes. Yes.
very good. - He used the duck as payment, and now he's being paid back the duck.
he goes, " Oh, my God, this is the greatest birthday ever.
he does it again.
now he's walking home, right? Walking...
so she was satisfied with duck.
with a duck as currency... - Yes.
to her. Great. Good.
so he's walking home, now he can't wait to get home to tell his father. Right?
he's walking down the street with the duck, and all of a sudden, voom, truck comes by and runs over his duck.
kills the duck? - Killed the duck.
so the duck is now dead. - The duck is dead.
the kid starts crying, truck driver stops, he's all upset, he didn't mean... - Of course he's crying!
he's a 13-year-old boy who's just had sex, twice, and he watched his beloved duck die.
will you shut up and let me tell the story?
so far, I don't know how this is ever gonna be funny.
the guy feels so bad about killing the duck, he gives him two dollars.
and the kid's happy with the two bucks?
he's ecstatic! He got laid twice, and now he's got two dollars on top of it.
seems like a duck would be worth a lot more than two dollars.
so he goes home, his dad goes, "What happened? What happened?"
tell me! Tell me!
he goes, "Dad, I got a fuck for the duck, I got a duck for the fuck, and I got two bucks for a fucked-up duck!
so it's like a limerick.
you didn't think that was funny?
I thought it was entertaining at the end, sure, the way all the words were put together, but in terms of content?
no.
stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
and cut.

Leckie.
Bob leckie.

skin and bones.
like a skeleton. like a rail.
he stole some roses from Mrs. Bano's yard let her scream stella, his jacket. ella.
I thought we were going for a stroll.
good news, bob. you're staying for dinner.
I am?
one word of an american coming to call and that was that.
leckie: this is like a thanksgiving.
Oh, what is that?
it's a holiday roosevelt made of the fourth thursday of november.
everyone sits at the table, eats turkey and argues.
roosevelt is a great man. you eat as much as you like, eh? stella.
the beans are from the garden.
you didn't touch the feta.
we save it for tomorrow, huh?
nay, mama, i'll start cleaning up.
you see?
good girl, my stella. good greek girl.
okay but don't break the good dishes
I won't you're on your own now.
I think i can handle this one.
so, mama, what's a greek girl like you doing in melbourne?
Oh, you don't care about that.
no no no, don't go officer on me. you're not australian.
no no, i come from the old country.
Smyrna.
that was sacked by the turks, wasn't it?
you know about that?
um, i read a lot.
the turks invaded in 1922 and burned it down.
all gone.
if you survived, you fled like my mama and me.
but we made it down to the docks.
we swam to a ship.
the captain took us onboard and sailed us to piraeus.
he saved our lives.
but our home was gone.
so where do we go?
we come here.
we live, we work, we find love.
so now you must tell about your home.
Yeah, about america.
no no no. not america. america we see in the movies. your family.
well, seems like we both escaped disaster.
I fled the leckie household.
how many in the household?
mama had five girls, three boys.
Oh, okto babies. your lucky mama.
I don't know if she'd agree.
she was almost 40 by the time i came along.
baba just like you and me you hear?
she was worn out by then.
I think they all were.
but it's a blessing, so many children.
well, marion and foddy leckie, they didn't want eight kids.
Oh no?
they should stop? they didn't want the beautiful baby son?
I was last.
lasts least.
Oh, bob. you know nothing.
by the time i met nicola it was almost too late to make babies.
not that we didn't try, eh?
eh, relax.
that girl in the kitchen, my only blessing.
I prayed for more, but god said no.
nothing you can do when god say no.
so where do you stay with the marines, huh?
they put us in the stadium where you play cricket.
what?
you will stay here tonight.
Stella, get the bed ready in the spare room.
okay. - i can't do that.
I could never repay you.
you can help clear the vines from the roof.
Yes, you will do that.
you will make this your home.
twist a guy's arm.
slanche.
Oh, dear god.
Oh, god.
no no no, you stay right there.
I think we should give it another go.
okay, sure. sure, me too.
but even americans need, uh.
Oh, a wait before they reload.
it's okay.
I'm going nowhere.
why did you have to flee your family?
my family.
not a happy bunch, my family.
why not?
something in our bones.
did your brothers go into the service to get away too?
one of my brothers was too old.
the other died when i was a kid.
that's terrible.
my father's been crippled in the head ever since.
we're not exactly the judge hardy family.
I swear, i'm just waiting for the clock to hit midnight and my sanity bell goes ringing.
I had a brother who died too.
you did?
no one talks about him.
he was a baby, just a few days old and didn't live.
mama got sick and wasn't able to have any more.
we start by restoring their bodies.
they rest. they play.
then we work on their pride.
we remind them they're marines.
then we replenish our supplies.
see, all of that takes money.
I understand.
it's a hell of a lot easier to raise money when there's a face behind it and a heroic story attached to it, like yours.
I don't feel like a hero, sir.
you're not getting it.
all right.
think of us out there on that line.
you know what we need new weapons, new gear, better motor transport.
Yes, sir.
selling u. s.war bonds is just as important, just as life saving, as what you did on guadalcanal.
now pack your seabag. you're going home home?
home?
how many u. s.war bonds you gonna sell stomping around the solomons with us?
go on.
get it done, sergeant.
I liked that.
shame on me.
I got you something.

real silk?
I'll wear them only for you.
wait wait wait wait. there's more. this.
is for everyone.
Oh no.
leg of lamb.

I'm not gonna tell you. - why not?
I think you should kiss me first. - how?

I can't get a leg of lamb.
but you do?
american ingenuity and a few packs of lucky strikes.
nicholas genkos wounded.
is that theodora genkos' nephew?
I don't know.
baba checks the casualty reports for greek names.
Alexi stavrapolous.
what's happened to alexi?
killed in action.
I grew up with alexi.
he lived two streets over.
change your shirt, nicola.
we'll take them the spanikopita.
I'd like to go.
pay my respects, if they're friends of yours.
this is my friend bob. - my condolences.
Stella and alexi, they were friends every since they were children.
he was her friend.
it's no good, bob.
mama is still up.
the greek boys are gone.
more and more every day all of stella's friends from when she grew up.
I prayed for them, and for their families.
do you go to church, bob?
St. mary's.
what kind of church?
Catholic.
I like the early morning mass.
less people.
hmm, we need prayers.
how are we going to make it through these years if we don't pray?
we are so lucky to have you with us, bob, to have a young man in the house.
I like you.
Stella, she likes you.
baba, he always wanted a son like you.
I am going to pray that you come back to us.
that's a good thing to pray for.
let's get your squads going!
pack up that gear and let's go!

better gear up, brother.
time to get back in shape.

the 03's are still more accurate.
exactly exactly. - no no, they're slower.
target in sight. - watch him miss.
do it! - come on, gibson.
come on, gibson.
bull'seye!
what are you doing?
you just shot some poor farmer's cow!
it was gonna be steak anyway.
not if it's a dairy cow, you idiot.
good shot, gibson.
what kind of morons have you become?
did you see that? i've never seen that.
you will be given one sack of raisins.
you will be given one sack of uncooked rice.
a japanese soldier can live on that for three weeks.
you will march the 100 miles back tmelbourne and be in the arms of your aussie girlfriends in three days.

Oh, sweet jesus, that feels good.
couple of doors down.
just right up? - yeah. take this with you.

please don't come here anymore.
I told mama and baba already that you got your orders and you left.
you couldn't say goodbye.
you lied?
I'm fairly crazy about you, robert.
I think you know that.
I thought so, yeah.
but.
I don't want to have a baby with you.
are you pregnant?
no. no.
you're not? - bob, you and i aren't going to have a family.
and we're not going to get married.
and you are never coming back to melbourne.
you're dumping me because you think i'm gonna get killed?
Bob.
if you don't come back to us, i don't just lose you, mama does too.
I can't do that to her and i won't let you.
she's lost so much already, bob.
she's praying for you to come back to us.
she can save her breath.
Leckie. leckie, god love you.
come here. - fuck off.
no, seriously. i've got to piss like terrible.
you've got to cover for me, okay?
I can't. drunk as a skunk.
one minute, that's all i need. come on. come on.
thank you.
Leckie, what are you doing?
manning this fucking post, lieutenant.
are you out of your mind? - i'm the fucking guard on guard duty.
you pull a fucking sidearm on an officer? - lieutenant, i went for a quick piss.
Leckie was just covering.
you fucking prick!
stand at attention. - fuck you!
I said stand at attention!
and i said fuck you!
don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me no no no, don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me till i come marching home.
yay, ma.
run, ma!
good hit, ma.
Yes, auntie, that's a six.
so i guess it's sort of like baseball, huh?
what happens in baseball?
well, in baseball, you hit a ball and you run to a base.
then you run to the next base if you can.
you keep going to the next base. if you get to enough bases you score a run.
gwen: sounds like rounders.
we play that in school.
looks like someone is hunting for you, cobber.
Hey, it's my turn.
shit.
your unit?
how company, 1st marines.
report to your c. o.no later than 2400.
I trust you marines got your heads back together.
I'm on orders from 2nd marine division.
lieutenant lebec has got the platoon now, and i want him to inherit a solid outfit so i volunteered you for reassignment to the battalion intelligence section you're booting us?
not you leckie.
fuck.
so, a little light.
Yeah.
how about if an engine catches fire and you dump in the pacific?
swim around for days, weeks, get strafed by jap zeroes.
finally the navy picks you up.
think about how many war bonds you'd sell then.
probably give you another medal.
you're gonna look up katie, right?
first chance i get.
I've been sending my poker winnings home to her.
Hey, 700 of that is mine.
that's the good thing about leaving i won't lose anymore money to you.
wish you were coming with me.
I think that's you.

how many, mates?
enough for a cricket team.
enough to make our beer run dry and our girls run loose.
have to fuck the king himself to find a taxi you warriors haven't commandeered.
I'd say it's a bit more like a gang of roaches.
every step we take, and bloody hell, there's another yank under our boot.
I'm guessing this is one yank we don't have to worry about anymore.
Hey, if it weren't for us you'd be guzzling sake with a pair of chopsticks up your ass, you stupid fuck.
okay okay, that's it.
yeah right, you're all tommy mix who saved the day.
it's okay.

this one hits the turps, first thing out he's having a blue.

Alan, another round of drinks for the cowboy yanks.
Oh, yank here.

good hit, ma.
Yes, auntie, that's a six.
so i guess it's sort of like baseball, huh?
what happens in baseball?
well, in baseball, you hit a ball and you run to a base.
then you run to the next base if you can.
you keep going to the next base. if you get to enough bases you score a run.
gwen: sounds like rounders.
we play that in school.
looks like someone is hunting for you, cobber.
Hey, it's my turn.
shit.
your unit?
how company, 1st marines.
report to your c. o.no later than 2400.
I trust you marines got your heads back together.
I'm on orders from 2nd marine division.
lieutenant lebec has got the platoon now, and i want him to inherit a solid outfit so i volunteered you for reassignment to the battalion intelligence section you're booting us?
not you leckie.
fuck.
so, a little light.
Yeah.
how about if an engine catches fire and you dump in the pacific?
swim around for days, weeks, get strafed by jap zeroes.
finally the navy picks you up.
think about how many war bonds you'd sell then.
probably give you another medal.
you're gonna look up katie, right?
first chance i get.
I've been sending my poker winnings home to her.
Hey, 700 of that is mine.
that's the good thing about leaving i won't lose anymore money to you.

I think that's you.
# The only time I feel good falling #
# Is when I'm falling fast and hard for you #
# The last two digits when I'm calling #
# Fade away but somehow I'll get through #
# The only time I feel good sinking #
# Is when I'm sinking fast and deep for you #
# You caught me as I was winking #
# Now I think my winking days are through #
# Could it be another change #
# To come and rearrange #
# Why can't she just feel that way I do #
dear friend...
I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand.
and didn't try to sleep with that person at that party...
even though you could have.
please, don't try to figure out who I am.
I don't want you to do that.
I just need to know that people like you exist.
like, if you met me you wouldn't think ...
I was the weird kid who spent time in the hospital.
and I wouldn't make you nervous.
I hope it's okay for me to think that.
you see, I haven't really talked to anyone outside of my family all summer.
but tomorrow is my first day of high school ever.
and I need to turn things around.
so I have a plan.
as I enter the school for the first time...
I will visualize what it will be like...
on the last day of my senior year.
unfortunately, I counted and that's...
hop, freshman toads! Hop! Let's move it!
1, 385 days from now.
we worked out all summer. Rock hard.
Hey, you know what? Why don't you guys get a room?
just 1, 385 days.
in the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister, Candace, and her boyfriend, Derek...
would have let me eat lunch with their Earth Club.
seniors only.
what are you doing with that plastic spork?
I don't wanna bring back silverware.
Derek, you're Earth Club treasurer. Come on!
when my sister said "No," I thought...
maybe my old friend Susan would wanna have lunch with me.
in middle school, Susan was very fun to be around...
but now she doesn't like to say "Hi" to me anymore.
and then there's Brad Hays.
before my older brother went to play football for Penn State...
he and Brad played together...
so I thought maybe he'd say "Hi" to me.
but Brad's a senior.
and I'm me. So who am I kidding?
on the bright side...
one senior decided to make fun of the teacher instead ofthe freshmen.
he even drew on Mr. Callahan's legendary goatee...
with a grease pencil.
the prick punch is not a toy.
I learned that back in 'Nam in '68.
Callahan,sergeant said...
you put down that prick punch.
you go kill some gooks.
and you know what happened?
that prick punch killed my best friend in a Saigon whorehouse.
I heard you were gonna be in my class.
are you proud to be a senior...
having to take freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?
look, my name is Patrick.
either you call me Patrick or you call me nothing.
okay, Nothing.
I felt really bad for Patrick.
he wasn't doing the impersonation to be mean or anything.
he was just trying to make us freshmen feel better.
nothing, why don't you read first?
all right. Chapter One.
surviving your fascist shop teacher...
who needs to put kids down to feel big.
wow, this is useful, guys. We should read on.
my last class of the day is Advanced English...
and I'm really excited to finally learn...
with the smartest kids in the school.
nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.
believe it or not, she's gotten straight A's since kindergarten.
Shh!
I'm Mr. Anderson.
I'm gonna be your teacher for freshman English.
this semester we're gonna learn about...
harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.
genius book.
now, who'd like to get out of the first pop quiz?
I'm shocked. All right. Well, you can skip the quiz...
if you tell me which author invented the paperback book.
anyone?
he was British.
he also invented the serial.
in fact, at the end of the third chapter of his first novel......
he had a man hanging from a cliff by his fingernails.
hence the term " cliff hanger " .
anybody?
yeah? - Shakespeare.
that's a great guess, but no.
Shakespeare didn't write novels.
anybody else?
the author...
was Charles Dickens.
however, if you and I had gone to a Shakespeare play........
it would have cost us four pennies.
can you imagine that?
we would have put those pennies in a metal box.
the ushers would lock it in the office.
and that's where we get the term...
cash register.
office Max.
I'll give you a free "A" on anything...
except the final term paper if you get it right.
box office.
you should learn to participate.
why didn't you raise your hand?
they call you the "teacher's pet"?
'Freak"? That kinda thing?
I used to get " spaz " .
I mean, come on, "spaz"?
you know, I heard you had a tough time last year.
but they say if you make one friend...
on your first day, you're doing okay.
thank you, sir, but if my English teacher...
is the only friend I make today...
that would be sort of depressing.
Yeah, I can see that.
don't worry, Mr. Anderson, I'm okay.
Thanks.
I would happily not take shop...
Hey, freshman toad.
well, I have 1, 384 days to go.
just so I say it to someone...
high school is even worse than middle school.
if my parents ask me about it...
I probably won't tell them the truth...
because I don't want them...
to worry that I might get bad again.
if my Aunt Helen were still here, I could talk to her...
and I know she would understand...
how I'm both happy and sad.
and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.
I just hope I make a friend soon.
love always, Charlie.
Charlie? Come on.
this chicken paprikash is delicious.
thank you, Derek. It's Charlie's favorite.
he was a little nervous about starting high school today, so I made it for him.
feel a little silly about being nervous now, Champ?
Yes, sir. I sure do.
I told you, just give 'em a smile...
and be yourself.
that's how you... - Make friends in the real world.
you're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
freshman year is tough, but...
you really find yourself.
Thanks, Derek.
you could have been a little nicer to Derek.
I'm sorry, the kid's a pussy. I can't stand him.
I really hope you love the mix tape I made. - I do.
the cover is hand-painted. - Wow.
Hey, Charlie, you want this?
are you sure?
he gives me one every week.
Hey, babe.
this next one might be a little sad, but it reminded me of your eyes.
# Sing me to sleep #
# I'm tired and I #
# I want to go to bed #
# Sing me to sleep #
did you already do the term paper on To Kill a Mockingbird?
no.
get him.
# Don't try to wake me in the morning #
# Cause I will be gone #
# Don't feel bad for me #
# I want you to know #
# Deep in the cell of my heart #
# I will feel so glad to go #
let's go, Devils!
right. Come on, offense!
Hey, Nothing. - Hey, Nothing.
suck it, virginity pledges.
suck it.
you're in trouble now, Jaguars!
Hey, Patrick.
Hey. You're in my shop class, right?
how's your clock coming?
my dad's building it for me.
Yeah. Mine looks like a boat.
you wanna sit over here or are you waiting for your friends?
no, no, no, I'll sit.
thanks for not calling me Nothing by the way.
it's an endless nightmare.
and these assholes, they actually think they're being original.
so do you like football?
love it. Love football.
maybe you know my brother then.
Hey, Sam.
question. Could the bathrooms here be more disgusting?
Yes. They call it the men's room.
so I finally got hold of Bob.
party tonight?
he's still trying to shag that waitress from the Olive Garden.
he's never tossing that salad.
come on!
Patrick.
yeah?
who's this?
this is...
Charlie Kelmeckis.
Kelmeckis?
no shit? Your sister's dating Ponytail Derek, isn't she?
God. - Is that what they call him?
would you leave Ponytail Derek alone?
you put the ass in class,Patrick.
I try. Sam, I try.
it's nice to meet you, Charlie. I'm Sam.
what's the plan? Are we going to Mary Elizabeth's tonight? - Nope.
she got caught watering down her parents' brandy with iced tea.
let's just go to Kings.
all right. We're going to Kings after the game if you wanna come.
do you have a favorite band?
well, I think The Smiths are my favorite.
are you kidding? I love The Smiths. Best breakup band ever.
what's your favorite song?
Asleep.It's from Louder than Bombs.
I heard it on Ponytail Derek's mix tape.
that works on so many levels.
I can make you guys a copy if you want.
what about Eides? You love Eides, right? - Yeah, of course. They're great.
not a band, Charlie.
it's a record store downtown.
things sound so much better on vinyl.
you know, I used to be popular before Sam got me some good music.
so you be careful. She'll ruin your life forever.
that's okay.
Hey, Nothing. - Hey, Nothing.
let it go! Jesus!
it's an antique joke. It's over.
so what are you gonna do when you get outta this place?
well, my Aunt Helen said I should be a writer...
but I don't know what I'd write about.
you could write about us.
Yeah! Call it Slut and the Falcon.
make us solve crimes.
you guys seem really happy together.
how long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend?
he's not my boyfriend. He's my stepbrother.
my mom finally left my worthless dad...
and married his nice dad when we moved here.
but she's not bitter or anything. Make no mistake.
absolutely not. Charlie, I'm not a bulimic.
I'm a bulim-ist. - I'm sorry, I don't know what that is.
she just really believes in bulimia.
I love bulimia!
Hey. Thanks for paying, Charlie.
no problem. Thank you guys for the ride.
maybe I'll see you around in school?
God, would you turn it down? You're gonna make us deaf. - So be it. It's rock and roll.
Bye, Charlie!
Bye, Charlie. - Okay, bye.
your mom says, "Don't go to Columbia with Candace, Derek " .
Shh! Shut... - Don't go to Columbia!
do you always want to be a mama's boy, Derek?
I am not a mama's boy!
you are, because every single time I go to your house...
every single time!
shut up, Candace!
you just stand there like a little bitch dog.
no. Charlie... Charlie, just go. I can handle it.
just don't wake up Mom and Dad.
Hey! Look who's here.
welcome home, Aunt Helen.
Aw! Look at you guys.
dressed so nice.
Hey, Candace.
what are you doing?
look, I egged him on. You saw it.
he's never hit me before, and I promise you, he will never hit me again.
like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?
Charlie, this is Ponytail Derek.
I can handle him.
do you trust me?
please, don't tell Mom and Dad.
my God, they're playing good music!
holy shit. Holy shit! They are! They're playing good music.
living room routine. - Living room routine.
Yes. - Yes!
excuse us. Excuse me. Pardon.
sorry.
get out of the way! Get out of the way!

God, it's freezing!
but you wore that toasty costume. It's not like it's cute or original.
you'd hope it would be warm. - Yeah, piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.
are you sure it's okay that I come?
Yeah, of course. Just remember, Charlie, Bob's not paranoid.
he's sensitive.
Sam!
that waitress from the Olive Garden, she was such a tease.
will you marry me?
only with Patrick's blessing.
Patrick?
you are a hopeless stoner who attends the culinary institute.
I'm gonna say "no" on that, but nice try. Charlie.
Touche.
so, Charlie. This is a party.
this is what fun looks like.
are you ready to meet some desperate women?
here, have a seat.
Hey, ladies.
meet Charlie.
Hi. - Meet ladies.
Hey. - Mary Elizabeth.
Alice. - Nice to meet you.
this is Charlie's first party ever.
so I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt blowjobs from both of you.
Patrick, you're such a dick. - Where the hell did you go?
the dance was a little boring, don't you think? - You are so selfish.
we looked everywhere for you. You could have told someone.
cry me a river.
how is it that you've got meaner since becoming a Buddhist?
just lucky, I guess.
no, you're doing something wrong, I think.
or something very right.
Yeah, well... - Hey!
look who's here.
is that Brad Hays?
Yeah. He comes here sometimes.
but he's a popular kid.
then what are we?
Charlie! You look like you could use a brownie.
thank you.
I was so hungry at the dance. I was gonna go to Kings...
but I didn't really have any time.
Thanks.
have you guys felt this carpet?
this carpet feels so darn good.
Charlie, Charlie, what do you think about high school?
high school?
bullshit.
the cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center.
people wear their letterjackets even when it's 98 degrees out.
and why do they give out letterjackets to marching band?
it's not a sport.
we all know it.
this kid is crazy.
Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really gonna regret that...
you know... haircut when you look back at old photographs.
my God!
I'm really sorry. That sounded like a compliment in my head.
my God!
well, it's kinda true.
shut up!
I can't even be mad at him. Look at him.
Bob, did you get him stoned?
come on, Sam, he likes it, just look at him.
how do you feel, Charlie?
I just really want a milk shake.
Sam...
you have such pretty brown eyes.
the kind of pretty that deserves to make a big deal about itself though, you know what I mean?
okay, Charlie. Let me make the milk shake.
what a great word. Milk shake.
it's like when you say your name over and over again in the mirror and after a while it sounds crazy.
so I'm guessing you've never been high before?
no. No, no, no.
my best friend, Michael, his dad was a big drinker so he hated all that stuff.
parties too.
well, where is Michael tonight?
he shot himself last May.
I kinda wished he'd left a note. You know what I mean?
Where's the bathroom?
it's up the stairs.
Thanks, Sam.
you're so nice.
Charlie.
weird.
Charlie.
what...
who was that kid?
relax. Relax. He's a friend of mine.
stay here.
I didn't see anything.
Yeah, I know you saw something, but it's okay.
okay, listen...
Brad doesn't want anyone to know.
wait.
are you baked? - Like a cake.
that's what Bob said.
and you can't have three on a match because then they'd find us.
and everybody laughed but I don't understand what's funny.
okay, Charlie, listen.
I need you to promise that you're not gonna say anything to anyone about me and Brad.
okay? This has to be our little secret.
our little secret. Agreed.
okay.
thank you.
we'll talk later.
I look forward to that big talk.
can I have your cherry?
isn't this the best milk shake ever, Alice?
it's even better than the first one.
Charlie just told me that his best friend shot himself.
I don't think he has any friends.
Hey, everyone!
everybody!
everyone...
raise your glasses to Charlie.
what did I do? - You didn't do anything.
we just wanna toast to our new friend.
you see things.
and you understand.
you're a wallflower.
what is it? What's wrong?
I didn't think anyone noticed me.
well, we didn't think there was anyone cool left to meet.
so come on, everyone.
to Charlie.
to Charlie.
welcome to the Island of Misfit Toys.
my God! What is this song?
right? I have no idea.
have you ever heard this before?
never.
Patrick, we've gotta go through the tunnel.
Sam, it's freezing.
Patrick, it's the perfect song.
no. Mama Patrick says " No " .
Patrick. It's Sam. It's Sam speaking to you right now.
I'm begging you to do this for me.
I concede!
what is she doing?
don't worry. She does it all the time.
turn it up!
you got it, your highness.
# We can be heroes #
# Just for one day #
# I #
# I will be king #
# And you #
what?
I feel infinite.
# And nothing #
# Will drive them away #
# We can be heroes #
# Just for one day #
dear friend...
I'm sorry I haven't written for a while but I've been trying hard not to be a loser.
for example, I'm trying to participate by listening to Sam's collection of big rock ballads and thinking about love.
Sam says they're kitschy and brilliant.
I completely agree.
I'm also writing essays and studying extra books outside of class.
as it turns out, Mr. Anderson is a writer.
he even had a play put up in New York once which I think is very impressive.
he and his wife might go back there after this year.
I know this is selfish, but I really hope he doesn't.
my favorite time, though, is lunch because I get to see Sam and Patrick.
we spend the time working on Mary Elizabeth's fanzine about music and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
it's called Punk Rocky.
Mary Elizabeth is really interesting because she's a Buddhist and a punk.
but somehow she always acts like my father at the end of a long day.
her best friend Alice loves vampires and wants to go to film school.
she also steals jeans from the mall.
I don't know why, because her family is rich but I'm trying not to be judgmental.
especially since I know that they were all there for Patrick last year.
Patrick never likes to be serious so it took me a while to get what happened.
when he was a junior, Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret.
I guess it was hard, too because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around.
then Monday in school, Brad would say "Man, I was so wasted I don't remember a thing.
this went on for seven months.
when they finally did it, Brad said he loved Patrick.
then he started to cry.
no matter what Patrick did
Brad kept saying that his dad would kill him.
and saying that he was going to hell.
Patrick was eventually able to help Brad get sober.
I asked Patrick if he felt sad that he still had to keep it a secret.
and he said "No," because at least now...
Brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him.
I think I understand, because I really like Sam.
I asked my sister about her...
and she said that when Sam was a freshman...
the upperclassmen used to get her drunk at parties.
I guess she had a reputation.
but I don't care.
I'd hate for her tojudge me based on what I used to be like.
so I've been making her a mix tape so she'll know how I feel.
shit!
C! - C!
give me a K! - K!
give me a Y! - Y!
what's that spell?
Rocky!
I can't hear you!
Rocky!
one more time!
Rocky!
# Whatever happened to Fay Wray? #
she went ape-shit.

that picture is gorgeous, Craig. What did you use?
I know. Thank you.
color film, but black and white paper for printing.
Yeah. My professor gave me an A...
but for all the wrong reasons.
most of them are idiots.
you'll see what I mean when you get to college.
how'd your S. A.T.'s go, by the way?
1150. I think I'll get into NYU.
Yeah, I hope so.
1490. Harvard. Face.
so...
are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
but I got my S. A.T. results back.
Oops.
you can take them again, you know.
Yeah, it's just, if I'm going to Penn State main campus...
I have to do much better.
I wish I would have studied freshman year.
it's a bit of a mess.
I'll help you study for the next one.
will you?
Yeah. Of course.
Thanks, Charlie.
what's this?
it's just a mix tape. No big deal.
my parents have a good stereo, so...
it's all about that night in the tunnel.
I couldn't find that song that we were listening to...
but, you know, I'm still searching for it, so yeah.
that's okay.
these are great.
Nick Drake.
the Shaggs.
you have really good taste, Charlie.
Really?
Yeah.
way better than me as a freshman.
I used to listen to the worst Top 40.
no. - Yeah, I did.
then I heard this old song.
pearly Dewdrops Drop.
and I thought someday I'd be at a party in college or something...
and I'd look up and see this person across the room.
and from that moment, I'd know...
everything was going to be okay.
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
I hope it works out.
I don't know.
Craig would be a big step up from her last boyfriend.
Yeah, no shit.
who could forget Mr. Car Wash Loser?
I just hope she can stop playing dumb with these guys.
I keep telling her, " Don't make yourself small " .
can't save anybody.
excuse me.
man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid.
how about something a little bit more upbeat?
let's just see.
so Sam tells me you wanna be a writer.
Yeah.
don't you write poetry, Craig?
poetry writes me. You know?
let's get this party started.
Wow.
that was fast.
you want another one?
Yeah.
all right.
Mr. Anderson?
can I ask you something?
Yeah.
why do nice people choose the wrong people to date?
are we talking about anyone specific?
well...
we accept the love we think we deserve.
can we make them know that they deserve more?
we can try.
Hey. - Hey, Sam. Didn't see you come in.
how's it going?
you wanna start work on probability and statistics?
Yeah. Sure.
page 291 in your book.
and I ordered you some breakfast.
the country breakfast.
dad?
can I have 30 dollars?
twenty dollars? What do you need 10 dollars for?
Sam's doing Secret Santa.
it's her favorite thing in the world. Please?
have fun.
Thanks.
Charlie.
this was my favorite book growing up.
this is my copy, but I want you to have it.
Thanks.
have a great Christmas break.
you, too, Mr. Anderson.
terrible stain.
that's pretty good, Charlie.
you gotta be kidding me.
if you fail me, you get me next semester.
Whoo!
C minus! Ladies and gentlemen, I am below average!
below average! - Below average!
guys, 1210.
what?
no more applications! No more S. A.T.'s!
thank you, Charlie!
all right. All right, guys, I got...
multiple pairs of blue jeans.
wow, this is a really tough one...
but I'm gonna have to guess Alice.
wait.
guys, a receipt! She actually paid!
I'm so touched!
Where's Craig?
he went home to Connecticut.
but he'll be back for New Year's Eve.
sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.
all right, big brother by three weeks, who's your Secret Santa?
I'll tell you, Sam.
this one's tough.
I have received a harmonica...
a Magnetic Poetry set...
a book about Harvey Milk...
and a mix tape with the song "Asleep" on it twice.
I mean, I have no idea.
this collection of presents is so gay...
that I think I must have given them to myself.
but despite that distinct possibility...
I'm gonna have to go with...
drum roll.
Charlie.
obviously.
beautifully done.
all right, Charlie. It's your turn.
okay.
Okay,okay.
I have received socks, pants, a shirt and a belt.
I was ordered to wear them all tonight, so...
guessing my Secret Santa is Mary Elizabeth.
now why do you say that?
you know, she bosses people around sometimes.
sorry.
what the hell is wrong with you? - Sorry.
you'll be surprised to know that your Secret Santa is actually me.
why all the clothes?
well, all the great writers used to wear great suits.
so your last present is on a towel rack in the bathroom.
delve into our facilities.
emerge a star.
perfect.
will you hand these out while I'm gone?
wait a second.
there's only Secret Santa presents. There's rules.
Mary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat Christmas?
hand them out, Sam.
all right. Mary Elizabeth. For you.
Alice.
Thanks.
Bob.
and this one's for me.
Alice, I know you'll get into NYU.
forty dollars to print Punk Rocky in color next time.
he knows me.
he really knows me.
all right, Charlie.
come on out.
get out here, buddy.
come on, Charlie. Charlie!
don't be shy.
come out, come out, wherever...
Yeah!
what a display of man I have never seen!
where are we going?
it's a surprise.
is this your room?
so cool.
Thanks.
you got me a present?
after all your help on my Penn State application?
of course I did.
open it!
I don't know what to say.
you don't have to say anything.
I'm really sorry we can't be here for your birthday.
no, that's okay. I'm just sorry you have to go back and visit your dad.
I'm in such a good mood I don't think even he could ruin it.
I feel like I'm finally doing good.
you are.
well, what about you?
when I met you, you were this scared freshman.
now look at you in that suit.
you're like a sexy English schoolboy.
I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out.
no.
innocent.
worst kinda guys.
never see you coming.
and parents love you.
that's, like...
extra danger.
Yeah, well, it hasn't worked so far.
you've never had a girlfriend?
not even like a second grade Valentine?
Nope.
have you ever kissed a girl?
no.
what about you?
have I ever kissed a girl?
no, no. Your first kiss.
I was 11.
his name was Robert.
he used to come over to the house all the time.
was he your first boyfriend?
he was my...
he was my dad's boss.
you know, Charlie, I used to sleep with guys who treated me like shit.
and get wasted all the time.
but now I feel like...
I have a chance. Like...
I can even get into a real college.
it's true. You can do it.
you really think so?
my aunt had that same thing done to her, too.
and she turned her life around.
she must have been great.
she was my favorite person in the world.
until now.
Charlie...
I know that you know I like Craig.
but I want to forget about that for a minute, okay?
okay.
I just wanna make sure that the first person who kisses you...
love you.
okay?
okay.
I love you, Charlie.
I love you, too.
I wanna do Secret Santa forever!
have a good time at your Mom's.
Thanks. And, listen, Charlie.
because your birthday's on Christmas Eve...
I figure you don't get that many presents?
I thought you should have my clock.
from the heart.
thank you, Patrick.
Bye.
have a good one, guys.
I love you guys!
Hey!
look who's here.
come here, little sister. - Hey, Chris.
Hey, honey.
ma, you look so thin.
you. Look at you.
Charlie.
come on, I got dinner ready.
happy birthday. - Thanks.
let's eat.
make a wish, honey.
can you see it, Charlie?
the luminaria is a landing strip for Santa Claus.
why don't you keep an eye out for him, and I will be right back, okay?
going to get your birthday present.
Hey.
God, I miss Mom's cooking.
you have no idea how good you have it.
I'm actually starting to hate pizza.
so how you liking school?
well, I'm no brainiac like you or Candace.
I'm doing okay.
okay? You're playing in a bowl game.
how are you feeling, Charlie?
good.
no, you know what I mean.
is it bad tonight?
no.
I'm not picturing things anymore.
or if I do, I can just shut it off.
well, you know, Mom did say that you have good friends now.
and maybe if it does get bad again...
you can just talk to them. Yeah?
Yeah.
especially Sam. She's great.
I'm gonna ask her out at New Year's.
I think the time is right now.
body of Christ. - Amen.
how long does this take to work?
Shovelin' snow?
I have to get this driveway clean.
and then...
I'm going to congratulate you on being happy.
cause you deserve it.
you said that an hour ago.
was that tonight?
I just...
saw this tree, but it was a dragon.
then it was a tree again and it just lied to me.
okay, Charlie, don't freak out. Give me this.
calm down.
look up.
isn't it quiet?
Sam, do you think if people knew...
how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you?
all the time.
so you wanna wear these glasses?
they'll protect you.
10, 9, 8, 7...
6, 5, 4...
3, 2, 1!
it's gonna be our little secret.
did your older friends pressure you?
no one pressured me, Officer.
I would never do drugs. Never.
then how did you happen to be passed out on the ground at 6: 00 in the morning?
well, I, um... I... I was really tired.
and I was feeling feverish...
so I went outside for a walk just to get some cold air.
I started seeing things, so I passed out.
you're seeing things again, Charlie?
not really.
nice suit.
it was a Christmas present.
did you have fun on your break?
more fun than you're gonna have today, Sinatra.
nice look, jag-off.
I've called him 30 times.
what are we supposed to do? We're going on in 10 minutes.
they said in health class... - Hello?
they say that about L. S.D. just to scare you.
are you sure? You know I've seen... - Charlie, you're fine, man.
guys, we have an emergency.
Craig has flaked out on us again.
so I need a Rocky.
Brad?
no. No way. No. I'm not...
there's people out there. No.
Charlie, take off your clothes.
# Then if anything grows #
# While you pose #
# I'll oil you up and rub you down #
# Down, down, down #
# And that's just one small fraction of the main attraction #
# You need a friendly hand #
# And I need action #
# Toucha toucha toucha touch me #
# I wanna be dirty #
# Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me #
# Creature of the night #
maybe I can join the cast as an alternate or something.
well, we're filled up now...
but they're gonna need people when we go to college.
we could put in a good word for you.
that'd be great. Thanks.
Yeah.
Charlie...
have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance?
the one where the girl asks the guy?
obviously, it is completely stupid.
and sexist. I mean, it's like "Hey, thanks for the crumb " .
and normally, I would just blow it off, because school dances suck torture.
but, you know, it's my last year and...
would you maybe wanna go with me?
you wanna go with me?
Yeah, I'm sick of macho guys.
plus you looked really cute in your costume.
so what do you say?
you must be Mary Elizabeth.
Yes.
it's so nice to meet you.
you, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis.
Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist.
please, come in. - Okay.
a little closer together.
that looks nice.
buddhist, I need you to smile a little bit more.
there you go. Nice.
Hey.
Hey.
are you having a good time?
not really. How about you?
I mean, I don't know.
it's my first date, I don't have much to compare it to.
you're doing fine.
sorry Craig couldn't come.
Yeah. He said he didn't want to go to some stupid high school dance.
I can't say I blame him really.
I don't know. if you like it, he should come.
Thanks, Charlie.
have a beautiful first date.
you deserve it.
I'll try not to make you too jealous.
now just let it breathe.
whoa.
it sure is a nice house.
Thanks.
don't you just love old music?
Yeah.
good. Cause I made you a mix of it.
I'd love to expose you to great things like...
Billie Holiday and foreign films.
this merlot is really fancy.
Yeah. My dad collects wine, but he doesn't drink.
that's kinda weird, isn't it?
I guess. Where are your parents?
their club's hosting a cotillion or something racist.
they'll be gone all night.
sure is a nice fire.
Yeah.
when I'm done being a lobbyist...
I wanna move to a house like this in Cape Cod.
sounds nice, doesn't it?
Yeah.
your heart is beating really fast.
is it?
here. Feel.
Charlie?
do you like me?
you know what I mean.
I think so.
don't be nervous.
Charlie.
I didn't know how tonight was gonna go, but...
it's really nice, isn't it?
Yeah.
I just can't believe it.
you, of all people.
I just can't believe you're my boyfriend.
shit! My parents! Shit!
here, zip this up. - Okay. No, I got this.
just zip it up like a normal zipper!
it's stuck. It's just...
thank you.
see you Monday.
dear friend...
sorry I haven't written for a while...
but things are a total disaster.
we're literally making out and I'm in my bra...
Hello! And the front door opens, it's my parents!
I probably should have been honest about...
how I didn't want to go out with Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but...
I really didn't want to hurt her feelings.
you see, Mary Elizabeth is a really nice person...
underneath the part of her that hates everyone.
Hey!
and since I heard that having a girlfriend makes you happy...
I tried hard to love her like I love Sam.
can you believe it's almost our 2-week anniversary?
Yeah, I know.
so I took her on double dates.
first foreign film.
do you want butter on your popcorn?
vegans don't eat butter.
and I tried not to mind that she loves to hold hands...
even when her hands are sweaty.
and I had to admit something really upsetting, but...
I'm tired of touching her boobs.
I thought maybe if she would just let me pick the make-out music...
once in a while, we might have a chance.
and maybe if she didn't put down the books that Mr. Anderson gives me.
Walden.
I read this in 7th grade.
I would have called it On Boring Pond.
or if she would stop calling me the minute I get home from school...
when I have absolutely nothing to talk about other than the bus ride home.
somehow she finds new things to say.
that dairy just sits with you.
you know, it walks with you.
she's on the phone right now?
Charlie, you've gotta break up with her.
I can do that?
for Christ's sake, I need to use the phone.
I got you this book.
it's really how I became a vegan.
I know I should have been honest...
but I was getting so mad, it was starting to scare me.
I mean the way they treat those...
I just wish I could have found another way to break up.
um, Mary Elizabeth, can I talk to you...
Charlie, please don't interrupt. You know I hate that.
in hindsight, I probably could not have picked...
a worse way to be honest with Mary Elizabeth.
truth or dare?
who are you talking to?
I dare you to kiss Alice.
gird your loins, procreator.
my God.
Mary Elizabeth, Samantha told me that you got into Harvard. Congratulations.
thank you. This one still hasn't gotten me flowers.
but I forgive you.
Hey, don't worry about Penn State. You're just wait-listed.
Yeah.
you guys are about to miss some severely hot fag-on-goth action.
Wow.
get a room.
you're a monster.
my turn. Let's see.
let's think. Charlie.
truth.
how's your first relationship going?
it's so bad...
that I keep fantasizing that one of us is dying of cancer.
so that I don't have to break up with her.
Charlie? Truth or dare?
Hello?
dare.
okay, I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in the room...
on the lips.
and notice I charitably said "girl" and not "person..."
because, let's face it, I'd smoke all you bitches.
that's fucked up.
Mary Elizabeth.
I'm so sorry.
it was a mistake, I'm sorry.
Sam? Sam?
I really didn't mean anything by it. I'm sorry.
what the hell is wrong with you?
I should go back and apologize.
Charlie, trust me, you don't wanna go back in there.
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to do anything.
I know you didn't.
but, look...
I hate to be the one to break this...
but there's history with Mary Elizabeth and Sam.
other guys and things that have nothing to do with you.
it's best if you just stay away for a while.
okay.
how long do you think?
Charlie.
come on, get dressed. You're gonna be late for Easter Mass.
I'll be there in a minute.
our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
give us this day our daily bread...
and forgive us our trespasses...
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us...
Mary Elizabeth, I've been listening to the Billie Holiday CD every night.
it's too late, Charlie.
I know. I just feel really bad about what I did.
I just get so messed up inside.
like I'm not there or something.
tell it to someone who cares. - Look, I know. I'm sorry.
just we've all become such good friends.
good friends?
do you mean the people that I've known since kindergarten...
and you've known for six months?
those good friends?
Yeah, I mean, I just don't wanna do anything to ruin our relationship.
it's ruined. Okay?
so stop calling everyone. Stop embarrassing yourself.
okay, I will. Good...
something's wrong with me. - Don't worry about it.
Hey, have you heard from Patrick?
no, he told me to stay away.
you don't know.
Why? Why? What happened?
Brad's father caught them together.
some kids jumped him outside the O.
no, it was some kids from North Hills.
did you see his face?
that's not what I heard.
are you okay?
not now, Charlie. I'm sorry.
Hey, Nothing.
Oops. Sorry, Nothing.
you gonna do anything?
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about your pet ape just tripped me.
gonna say something?
why would I? - You know why.
this is pathetic, man. Your fixation on me.
do you want your friends to know how you got those bruises? Really?
I got jumped in a parking lot.
where? Schenley Park?
do you guys know about Schenley Park?
do your friends know... - I don't know what kinda sick shit...
you're trying to pull, but you better walk away right now.
nothing.
fine.
say hi to your dad for me.
whatever, faggot.
what did you just call me? - Just called you a faggot.
say that shit again! Say that shit again!
it's Patrick!
leave him alone!
Sam!
stop! Leave him! Stop!
stop!
touch my friends again and I'll blind you.
Charlie?
yeah?
thanks for stopping 'em.
sure, Brad.
how you doing, Charlie?
I don't know.
I keep trying, but I can't really remember what I did.
do you want me to tell you?
Yeah.
you saved my brother.
that's what you did.
so you're not scared of me?
no.
can we be friends again?
of course.
come on.
let's go be psychos together.
I'm dating Peter now.
he's in college with Craig.
he's opinionated. We have intellectual debates.
you were very sweet but our relationship was too one-sided.
I know this is hard for you.
I'm just glad that you're happy.
okay.
Hey, Craig, Sam will be down. Soon.
we're gonna miss the movie.
Yeah, I'll go put some pep in her step. Don't worry.
Hello?
Hey. Do you wanna get out of here?
sure, Patrick.
I'll tell you something, Charlie...
I feel good. You know what I mean?
maybe tomorrow I'll take you to this karaoke place downtown.
and this club off the strip. They don't card.
and the Schenley Park scene.
you have to see the Fruit Loop at least one time.
my God. My life is officially an after-school special.
son of a bitch!
it really is.
it so is.
so, you ever hear the one about Lily Miller?
I don't know.
Really?
I thought your brother would have told you. It's a classic.
maybe.
okay, Lily comes here one night with this guy Parker.
and this was to be the night that they were gonna lose their virginity.
so she did it really proper. She packed a picnic.
stole a bottle of wine.
everything was perfect and they're just about to " do it " .
when they realize they forgot the condoms.
so what do you think happened? - I don't know.
they did it with one of the sandwich bags.
that's disgusting!
Yes, it is.
come on! Let's keep the train rolling.
suburban legend, Charlie.
well...
there's this girl named Second Base Stace.
and, well, she had boobs in 4th grade.
mosquito bites. Promising. Go.
and she let some of the guys feel them.
that's your suburban legend? - Yeah.
did you at least cop a feel? - No.
no. Of course not. You went home...
listened to "Asleep," wrote a poem...
fine. Okay. Your turn.
Yeah. I've got one.
well...
there's this one guy.
queer as a 3-dollar bill.
the guy's father doesn't know about his son.
so he comes into the basement one night when he's supposed to be out of town.
catches his son with another boy.
so he starts beating him.
but not like the slap kind. Like, the real kind.
and the boyfriend says, "Stop. You're killing him " .
but the son just yells, "Get out " .
and eventually...
the boyfriend just did.
why can't you save anybody?
I don't know.
forget it.
I'm free now, right?
I could meet the love of my life any second.
things will be different now and that's good.
I just need to meet a good guy.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
it's all right.
I've been spending a lot of time with Patrick.
he begins every night really excited.
he always says he feels free and tonight is his destiny.
but after a while he runs out of things to keep himself numb.
and Sam got her letter from Penn State.
we will require you to take our summer session...
at the main campus immediately following your high school graduation.
she got in, Charlie.
after that, all Patrick could talk about was college and all their futures.
Alice did get into NYU film school.
Patrick is going to the University of Washington...
because he wants to be near the music in Seattle.
but he wasn't going to leave without organizing the best senior prank ever.
Sam is going away right after graduation.
it all feels very exciting.
I just wish it were happening to me.
especially because, ever since I blacked out in the cafeteria...
it's been getting worse.
and I can't turn it off this time.
all right, guys, you wanna pass your copies of Gatsby up to the front, please.
and I know it's the last day...
but if we could keep it to a dull roar, I'd appreciate it.
thank you.
guy. Guys. Thank you for such a great year.
I had a blast. I hope you did, too.
and I hope you have a great time this summer on your vacations.
now who here is gonna read for pleasure this summer?
Charlie.
very good.
have a good summer.
last day.
Yeah.
so I know it's none of my business, but have you decided?
are you going to New York?
well...
my wife and I like it here.
and I think I might be better at teaching than writing.
you know, Charlie, I was thinking that...
maybe I could still give you books next year.
Yeah. Yeah.
I think you could write one of them one day.
Really? - I do.
you're the best teacher I've ever had.
thank you.
ten, nine, eight...
seven, six, five...
four, three, two, one.
dear friend...
I wanted to tell you about us running.
there was this beautiful sunset.
and just a few hours before, everyone I love...
had their last day of high school ever.
I was happy because they were happy...
even though I counted and I have...
1, 095 days to go.
I kept imagining what school would be like without them...
as they were all getting ready for their prom.
my sister finally decided to break up with Derek...
and go stag with her girlfriends instead.
and then there was Sam.
I've looked at her picture since that night.
I like to see how happy she was before she knew.
they were in a hotel suite after prom and the truth came out.
basically Craig has been cheating on Sam the whole time.
when I heard that...
I kept thinking about the happy girl in these pictures.
cause she doesn't have 1, 095 days to go.
she made it.
this is her time.
and no one should be able to take that away.
Congratulations.
Charlie. Charlie's here. Guys, group photo.
we should all take a group photo.
Ooh! Get against the railing and try to look suave.
Yep, this is the one. That's gonna be a great angle.
at her going away party...
I wanted her to know about that night we went through the tunnel.
and how for the first time...
I felt like I belonged somewhere.
and tomorrow, she's leaving.
so I wanted to give her a part of me.
are these all your books, Charlie?
thanks for staying up with me.
sure.
my brother said Penn State has this restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner.
you have to get a grilled sticky on your first night.
it's a tradition.
that sounds like fun.
Yeah.
pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group offriends, you know.
you won't even think about this place anymore.
Yes, I will.
had lunch with Craig today.
yeah?
he said he was sorry and that I was right to break up with him.
I'm driving away and was feeling so small.
just asking myself, "Why do I and everyone I love... "
pick people who treat us like we're nothing?
we accept the love we think we deserve.
then why didn't you ever ask me out?
I, um...
I just didn't think that you wanted that.
well, what did you want?
I just want you to be happy.
don't you get it, Charlie?
I can't feel that.
it's really sweet and everything, but...
you can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours...
and think that counts as love.
I don't want to be somebody's crush.
I want people to like the real me.
I know who you are, Sam.
I know I'm quiet.
and I know I should speak more.
but if you knew the things that were in my head most of the time...
you'd know what it really meant.
how much we're alike...
and how we've been through the same things.
and you're not small.
you're beautiful.
what's wrong, Charlie?
nothing.
come on, Sam.
what's wrong, Charlie?
put your seat belt on.
we'll meet you there.
don't wake your sister.
it'll be our little secret, okay?
look, Charlie, she's fast asleep.
don't wake your sister.
my fault.
it's all my fault.
it'll be our little secret. Okay?
stop it.
stop.
stop crying.
this'll be our little secret.
Candace. Your brother's on the phone.
Hello?
Hey, Candace. - Charlie?
Sam and Patrick left, and I can't stop thinking about something.
Shh. What?
Candace...
I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I?
she died getting my birthday present...
so I guess I killed her, right?
I've tried to stop thinking that, but I can't.
she keeps driving away and dying.
call the police and send them to my house.
I can't stop her. I'm crazy again.
no. Charlie, listen to me.
mom and Dad are gonna be home with Chris any second.
I'm just thinking...
what if I wanted her to die, Candace?
what? Charlie?
Charlie!
Charlie?
I'm Dr. Burton.
where am I?
mayview Hospital.
you... you have to let me go. My dad can't afford it.
don't worry about that.
no. I saw them when I was little...
and I don't want to be a Mayview kid.
just tell me how to stop it.
stop what?
seeing it.
all their lives all the time.
how do you stop seeing it?
seeing what, Charlie?
there is so much pain.
and I don't know how to not notice it.
what's hurting you?
no, not me.
it's them. It's everyone. It never stops.
do you understand?
what about your Aunt Helen?
what about her?
do you see her?
Yes.
she had a terrible life.
God, what am I supposed to...
you said some things about her in your sleep.
I don't care.
if you want to get better...
you have to.
she...
she was insane.
I'm just saying.
she...
Charlie?
you gonna let me help you here?
okay.
do you remember anything before you blacked out?
I remember leaving Sam's house.
I was walking home. And...
I was in the hospital for a while.
I won't go into detail about all of it.
but I will say there were some very bad days.
and some unexpected beautiful days.
the worst day was the time my doctor told my mom and dad...
what Aunt Helen did to me.
honey?
I'm so sorry.
the best days were those when I could have visitors.
my brother and sister always came for those...
until Chris had to go to training camp.
he's going to be first string this year.
my sister told me she met a nice guy at her summer job.
here he is.
so I'll see you Thursday at 6: 00, right?
okay.
my doctor said we can't choose where we come from...
but we can choose where we go from there.
I know it's not all the answers...
but it was enough to start putting these pieces together.
God bless this food we are about to receive.
we thank you for this bounty...
in the name ofour Lord Jesus Christ, Amen.
Amen. - Amen.
how do you think the Penguins are gonna do this year, Dad?
goddamn Penguins.
think they're allergic to goddamn defense.
what do the players call a puck again?
a biscuit.
are you sure it's not a "goddamn biscuit"?
you're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
honey, I think we're gonna have to do...
a little shopping for you before you take off?
Yeah, I need some books. - Clothes, too.
Yeah.
can Charlie come out and play?
the first night, we had grilled stickies.
so good.
you have to visit in the fall. We'll have some, okay?
definitely.
Oh,Sorry...
Charlie has a breakdown scheduled for October.
well, can I tell you something?
I've been away for two months.
it's another world.
and it gets better.
and my roommate Katie has the best taste in music.
I found the tunnel song.
let's drive.
I don't know if I will have the time to write any more letters...
because I might be too busy trying to participate.
so, if this does end up being the last letter...
I want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school.
and you helped me.
even if you didn't know what I was talking about...
or know someone who's gone through it.
you made me not feel alone.
because I know there are people who say all these things don't happen.
there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17.
I know these will all be stories someday.
and our pictures will become old photographs.
and we'll all become somebody's mom or dad.
but right now these moments are not stories.
this is happening.
I am here.
and I am looking at her.
and she is so beautiful.
I can see it.
this one moment when you know you're not a sad story.
you are alive.
you stand up and see the lights on the buildings...
and everything that makes you wonder.
and you're listening to that song on that drive...
with the people you love most in this world.
and in this moment, I swear...
we are infinite.

good morning, Doctor.
good morning, Charles. You're looking splendid.
I feel splendid.
every day, and in every way, you're feeling
better and better.
indeed. - Well, won't you sit here?
wouldn't you like me to
not unless you want to.
no. I'll be quite comfortable here. Thank you.
doctor, I'm surprised.
Oh, of course. You quit.
three months ago.
you know, there was a time when your forgetfulness...
would have made me feel very rejected.
not now, hmm? - Well, a little rejected, perhaps.
did you do it intentionally? - Why should I do that?
well
I'm a patient you consider to be completely rehabilitated...
on your recommendation soon to appear before the sanity board...
your reputation on the line.
a little test, perhaps, hmm?
not very long ago, an obvious trick like that...
would have sent you into a towering rage.
and poor old Clouseau would have silently...
and passively submitted to another massacre.
it's a miracle you were somehow able to keep putting him back together again.
poor old Clouseau.
there was a time when I couldn't even speak his name.
and there was also a time when you would joyfully have killed him.
Yes.
I was a sick man, wasn't l?
we've come a long way, haven't we?
and you're not even a little bit bothered when you think of Clouseau?
not even a little bit.
do you believe me? - If you say so.
well, I could be lying.
you are a good psychiatrist, but I may be a better liar.
for your sake, I hope you're not.
sooner or later, you'd run into Clouseau...
and then back here for life.
no more chance of another hearing.
coming here day after day, watching you chain smoke into an early grave...
and knowing on certain mornings, you'll be particularly morose and testy...
because you've had another fight with your wife...
like this morning.
how do you know that? - It's the only time you doodle.
I keep forgetting you used to be chief inspector of the Surete'.
and will be again.
but Clouseau is chief inspector now.
till the better man comes along.
well, in that case...
I think Inspector Clouseau had better start looking to his laurels.
what? You mean
the board meets at 2: 00 this afternoon.
this afternoon?
if everything goes as I expect it to, you'll be out of here this afternoon.
thank you. - See you at 2: 00.
Clouseau!
now, now, Doctor.
some people would consider your methods most unorthodox.
I was just making sure that you're not a better liar than I am a psychiatrist.
1899/12/31 0: 02: 00
come along. Good.
how.
help!
grab hold of this. Pull. Pull on this.
help!
out with the bad air, in with the good.
out, in.
don't look, Fiona! - Out, out.
and now the kiss of life.
pervert!
dirty old men!
please, there is no need to thank me.
thank you? - For saving your life.
someone
I was hit on the head.
Yes, you have received a bump upon the head.
Beump? - What?
you said "beump." - Yes, I know that.
it is a large bump.
you could receive a concussion from such a bump.
allow me to assist you. - No!
I'm all right. I'm fine.
never better. Just a little shaky.
probably the shock of
I mean, the surprise of seeing you here again today.
well, I received a report...from the sanity commission...
that they were going to review your case today...
so I thought a few words from me on your behalf
Oh, God-- I mean, how generous of you, but
well, I'm not without influence, you know.
Yes, I know that.
Yes, I have become a rather important official... in the department.
I've heard you are the new chief inspector.
Yes.
Yes, we made quite a few changes since you went crazy.
for the better, I'm sure.
by the way, Sergeant Chevalier sends you his kind regards.
Oh, Sergeant Chevalier.
good old Sergeant Chevalier. How is he, anyway?
well, you know, there are leaders and there are followers...
and I'm afraid Sergeant Chevalier will always be a follower, no?
Oh, yes.
and you, my friend Clouseau-- a leader, huh?
always a leader? Onwards and upwards to the top, hmm?
it is my karma. - What?
my destiny. - Oh, yes.
Yes, a few more years on the force...
and I might even be persuaded to run for the public office.
you can count on my vote.
and you, my friend, can count on me...
to do everything in my power to get you out of this place.
Oh, yes. I know how you feel.
my hat. Well
are you all right, former Chief Inspector?
Yes!
Yes, I'm perfectly all right.
see?
one moment, and I will have you extracted.
I'm fine. I am perfect.
every day, and in every way...
I'm getting better and better.
I'm afraid that this is just not your day, my friend.
but it is my day.
it is, my friend.
after three long terrible years...
it is at last my day.
I will not permit-- repeat-- not permit anything
repeat-- anything to spoil it.
now, I will walk you to the gate...
and I will kiss you good-bye...
and you will drive off in your new car...
which should rightfully be mine...
and then I will have my interview with the sanity commission.
and they will set me free, and then...
I will kill you.
kill you! - Francois!
start the car!
kill!
I'll kill him!
I want to kill him!
I've got to kill him.
Oh, allow me.
Cato?
forty winks.
it's the phone.
the phone is ringing.
relax. I'll get it.
this is Chief Inspector Clouseau's residence.
this is Chief Inspector Clouseau... speaking on the phone.
what? Oh, put him on.
good evening, Commissioner.
how are you? How is Madame and all the little commissioners?
I see.
well, you can rest assured...
that I shall take every precaution that is necessary.
thank you, Commissioner, and good evening.
I have just received word that former Chief Inspector Dreyfus...
has escaped from the insane asylum.
for some reason, the deputy commissioner...
thinks that he might try to kill me.
obviously, the poor man is crazier than anyone gives him credit for.
nevertheless, I am ordered to take every precaution.
see that the back and front doors are locked...
while I slip into my new hunchback disguise.
both doors are locked now.
who are you?
what have you done with Inspector Clouseau?
chief Inspector Clouseau.
fooled you, didn't l?
Oh, Chief Inspector, that is fantastic.
if you think this is fantastic...
wait till you see the full effect with the hump.
the bells!
they deafen me!
chief Inspector Clouseau?
Yes, this is Chief Inspector Clouseau.
who is speaking?
my name is Duval.
Claude Duval.
I have the honor to be chairman...of the Jacques Clouseau presentation committee.
the presentation committee? For me?
for what purpose, may I ask?
for what purpose, you ask.
how modest of you.
the purpose, monsieur, is to honor...
one of the city's most dedicated... brave and selfless public servants.
you are most generous, monsieur. Most.
Yes, I must admit I have often wondered, considering my years on the force...
and my numerous accomplishments, why recognition was not forthcoming earlier.
absolutely right.
nine years faithful service at the Surete'...
and not as much as a single decoration in all that time.
Yes, that is quite correct.
however, as you are no doubt aware...
I have recently received an important promotion.
Really?
I have replaced the lunatic Dreyfus as chief inspector.
I know, and I'm sure Paris sleeps the more safely because of the change.
you're very most kind.
but I can assure you when it comes to matters of keeping the peace...
chief Inspector.
one moment, please.
can't you see that I'm on the phone?
Oh, yes, Commissioner.
fortunately, there was sufficient air still left in my hump...
to keep me afloat until the rescue.
Yes. Well, thank you very much, Commissioner. Good-bye.
that was the commissioner. He was most concerned.
well, you have been very, very lucky, you know.
Yes, I know. Poor Cato will be in the hospital for weeks.
do you know what kind of a bomb it was?
the exploding kind.
mark my words, Francois. Sinister forces are at work.
and this mad bomber must be apprehended at all costs.
make sure you issue an all-points bulletin immediately.
Yes, sir. - What about my clothes?
Oh, Sergeant Chauvin is rounding some up for you.
while you're waiting, perhaps you'll sign the order...
to transport Jean Tournier to prison.
Tournier the bank robber? I shall be happy to sign that order.
Ah, it's life for you this time, Tournier.
at last, we are rid of you.
I have to go to the toilet.
all right.
thank you.
all right, Tournier. That's long enough.
now this is my plan.
step number one:
I will recruit the world's greatest criminal minds. Step number two:
I will build an organization so sinister, so powerful...
by comparison, the Cosa Nostra will seem like the Vienna Boys Choir.
here is the list. - But half of these men are in prison.
we'll get them out. - Impossible.
I'll bet you 20 million francs it isn't.
where would I get 20 million francs? - I thought you'd ask that.
step number three: Next Thursday at precisely 2: 00 p. m...
you and six men will enter the main branch of the Paris credit bank.
this afternoon, at approximately five minutes to 5: 0...
three men dressed in building maintenance uniforms...
entered and robbed the Paris credit bank.
the leader has been identified as Jean Tournier.
how much did they get?
millions. Here's the report.
all right. That will be all, Francois. Thank you.
twenty million francs.
and now, the next step.
hugo Fassbender and his daughter have been kidnapped.
professor Fassbender? - Yes. Paris has a theory.
they're sending over their top man-- a Chief Inspector Clouseau.
he just sent this telegram. "Arrived Gatwick Airport, B. R. 121, 12: 38 p. m.
yes? Who are you?
Jarvis, sir. - And what is it you do?
I am the butler. - Ah, the butler. Yes, yes.
can you tell me where you were on the night of the kidnapping?
asleep in my room, sir. - Asleep in your room.
can you prove that? - No.
make a note of that, Sergeant Yard.
tell the staff to assemble in the drawing room.
I will interview them in a few moments.
Yes, sir.
what was your name again? - Jarvis.
Jarvis, that's right. Perhaps you'll be kind enough to show me around the house.
very good, sir.
I suggest we start with the upstairs.
this is the upstairs, sir. - Yes, I know that.
this is a door.
Yes, that is a door.
Yes, I know that. - It's not locked, sir.
obviously.
stay where you are. I prefer to handle this alone.
is there anybody hiding there in the dark?
nothing like a good warm-up when you're on a case, you know?
tell me, which switch did you use to turn on the lights?
the light switch, sir.
strange. It didn't work for me.
Yes.
unless I miss my guess, this would be the gymnasium room.
Yes, sir. - Yes. It is a good room.
Yes.
this reminds me of my younger days at the Surete' police academy.
the parallel bars-- my speciality.
I was something of an athlete, you know. Yes, yes.
I was known as the Pavlova of the parallels.
Oh, yes.
Yes, it's all coming back now.
Yes, I remember it
well, that felt good!
well, now. I expect you're all wondering why I asked you here.
it's obvious that the knight that wore that suit...
did not last very long.
Yes, yes. I know.
now.
Yes. As I was saying
you were saying you supposed we were all wondering why you called us.
look. There is no need for you to speak unless I ask you a question.
what is your name? - I'm Shork, the gardener.
and what is it you do? - I'm the gardener.
why didn't you say that in the first place?
I did. - Don't be funny with me.
this is a very serious matter...
and everyone in this room is under the suspicions.
Reum? - What? What was that?
you said, "Reum." - Yes, I know that.
and there is a very good chance that someone in this room...
knows more about the murder than he is telling.
murder? - What was that you said?
I said murder. - What murder?
well, I don't know. You said murder.
I said murder? You said murder!
no, I said murder because you said murder!
I said murder? - You said someone in this room...
knows more about the murder than he's telling.
now listen
what was your name? - Shork.
the cook. - Gardener.
now we are getting somewhere.
you
Oh, dear!
are you all right, Mr. Stutterstutt?
who is this man? - He's Mr. Stutterstutt.
I see, and what is your job, Mr. Stuckerstuff?
he's the beekeeper.
I'm not asking you. I'm asking Mr. Stuffsucker.
what's that? What is he saying to you? What? What was that?
he says he's got a bit of a cold, and he's lost his voice.
lost his voice. A beekeeper who has lost his voice...
a cook who thinks he's a gardener...
and a witness to a murder.
Oh, yes. It is obvious to my trained eye...
that there is much more going on here... than meets the ear.
before you are dismissed, Mr. Stiffsticker...
I suggest you count your bees.
you may find that one of them is missing.
you ruined that piano!
what is the price of one piano... compared to the terrible crime that has been committed here?
but that's a priceless Steinway!
not anymore. What is your name?
Mrs. Leverlilly.
Mrs. Loveliver. I would take a shrewd guess...
that you are the housekeeper, right?
I have been with Professor Fassbender for 30 years.
that would account for your exaggerated hysteria...
over a simple blemish on the furniture.
blemish!
whatever has happened to the piano can easily be repaired.
what has happened to Professor Fassbender...
and his daughter is another matter.
and it is my job to bring the guilty party, or parties, to their justice.
now, then, what do we know?
one: That Professor Fassbender...
and his daughter have been kidnapped.
two: Someone has kidnapped them.
three: My hand is on fire.
drummond, what's going on?
good afternoon, sir.
inspector Clouseau has been interrogating the staff.
inspector Clouseau, Superintendent Quinlan.
Oh, Inspector.
superintendent.
why don't you just tell Potters that he's incompetent...
and request that he be taken off the case?
because we've got enough trouble with France...
without suggesting that their greatest detective is a fool.
steady.
where is he now?
he is shadowing the Fassbender farm.
Hello, sailor.
yes? - Who are you?
Chuck. Who are you?
what's that?
I am Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau of the Surete'.
how exciting. -I think I will just take a look around.
Yes. Well, you'll have to make use of the bar first or take a table.
the show starts in a few minutes. - In that case, I will take the table.
right. Follow me, Jock.
Jacques. - Jack?
ladies and gentlemen, once again...
it is my profound pleasure to introduce...
the incomparable Ainsley Jarvis!
what's a queen Without a castle
you're right
no queen at all
and you'd be right again to say
the winter's day
is cold
till you
come
until you love me
I always will be wanting
this need I need
can come from only
you
until you love me
I'll live a life of longing
for that's the next best thing I can do
no way of knowing
which way you're heart is going
to go
I don't think you know
take as long as it takes
your love
to grow
until you love me
not one dream can come true
in all my dreams
there is a place For you
and so I'll keep those dreams
until
you love me Too
why is it that this afternoon you are Jarvis, the Fassbender butler...
and tonight, you are Inspector, before you get all-- I must warn you.
you had better watch your step.
something wrong, Ainsley? - Of course not, Bruno.
no, the inspector was just warning me that I had to watch my step.
you see, back in France, he's known as king of the tango.
tango? - Oh, I'd love to.
the kidnappers are here. - Kidnappers?
okay. Let's go.
you want to call Paris now?
look at it this way. It can't possibly get any worse.
professor Fassbender!
what an honor to have you and your charming daughter as my guests.
who the devil are you? - Ah, yes. Who the devil, indeed.
come. Sit down. Let us just say for the moment...
that I'm your host and that I will do everything in my power...
to make your stay here at Mondschien Castle as pleasant as possible.
providing, of course...
that you reciprocate by giving me something that I very much want.
and that would be?
I am fascinated by your work on time-space relationships...
particularly the vortices of electromagnetic aberrations.
I see.
and do you work for a particular government...
or do you expect to sell my discovery to the highest bidder?
neither, Professor. Nothing so mundane.
you and l-- we're going to join forces, Professor.
we're going to build the Doomsday Machine and conquer the world.
have a sweet. - You're mad.
mad? On the contrary...
every day, in every way...
I've been getting better and better.
mad? Was Hannibal mad?
or Alexander? Surely Napoleon was the maddest of them all. Mad?
we shall see, Professor.
I shall tell you nothing. - I think you will.
I'll die first.
show Miss Fassbender to the schoolroom.
daddy?
what are you going to do?
something so very, very painful, so hideous...
your father will have no choice but to cooperate.
all right. I'll tell you anything.
the Wolverines certainly have to put some points on the scoreboard.
I'm sure that Green will come out throwing.
he's got to get that ball down deep into Navy territory.
green now on third down. Looks to the left, throws it
all right, team! Let's go!
Throw's complete to Rhodes! He's inside the 15! He's to the 20!
the clock is running down. Can the Wolverines do it?
what happened? - Where's the game?
who is that? - Hello there.
he's on every station. - Well, call the F. C.C.
hold it! He's saying something.
Mr. President, everybody, calm down.
calm down, hell! This is an emergen
an emergency. Did Michigan score?
please, let's hear what the fellow has to say.
it is little enough to ask the life of one man... against a holocaust... that could destroy the globe.
what the hell's he talking about?
quiet.
that's why I say again...
give me Clouseau.
and we can all sleep secure in bed. - What's a Clouseau?
and so, next week...
I shall give the world a demonstration of the awesome power I hold.
on Saturday, October 9th...
at precisely 3: 00 p. m. Eastern Standard Time...
the United Nations building
will vanish from the face of the earth.
and the gun goes off. The game is over.
call the F. B.I. the C. I.A. and the Pentagon.
find out who won the game!
that's a photograph taken by an American news photographer... while the broadcast was in progress.
Paris has identified him as one Charles Dreyfus...
former chief inspector of the Surete'.
you're joking. - And more recently an inmate...
at the state facility for the criminally insane.
until he escaped. Here's a text of his speech.
he obviously controls equipment...
sophisticated enough to pirate the satellite.
give me Clouseau, and we can all sleep secure in our beds.
thought that might interest you.
that's one crazy chief inspector talking about another crazy chief inspector.
what does he mean anyway? "Give me Clouseau.
listen to this. "Little enough to ask the life of one man... against a holocaust that could destroy the globe.
you missed the best bit. Look.
he also threatens to make the U. N. building disappear.
operation Looking Glass? - Fassbender.
give me Lovell. Home Office.
Where's Clouseau? - I've no idea.
now, ladies and gentlemen, once again...
the incomparable Ainsley Jarvis.
Monsieur Jarvis?
sir, the coroner's report. - Ah, yes.
it's amazing. Even after he had been stabbed twice...
he was still able to break the kidnapper's neck.
Ah, pity. - Yes, he had a lovely voice.
I meant pity that the kidnapper's dead. We might have got something from him.
I did get something out of him. - What?
what's that?
a clue. - Clue?
what? - You said a clue.
Yes. A brochure clue
advertising the Oktoberfest in Munich.
it begins the day after tomorrow.
and you think the dead man was planning to go there, perhaps to meet someone?
Yes. Perhaps to meet...
the lunatic Dreyfus.
at one time, partners in the war against crime...
now archenemies.
you'll need help. - I prefer to do this alone.
Yes, but if Dreyfus is what we suspect, he probably has an army behind him.
of course it won't be easy, but nothing worthwhile ever is.
that is why I have always failed where others have succeeded.
for me, the greater the odds, the greater the challenge.
and, as always, I accept the challenge.
well, I am off to Munich.
most ingenious. The old closet ploy.
I really must congratulate you. If there's one thing I do enjoy...
it's a good closet ploy.
well, until we meet again and the case is solved.
the case is solved.
four minutes.
we're gonna look like a bunch of Dipsy Doodles if this is a hoax.
well...
we would look very foolish if we didn't take every precaution...
and it turned out not to be a hoax.
Dr. Fassbender and Operation Looking Glass are certainly no hoax.
God. A weapon like that in the hands of a crazy Frenchman.
you are certain? You can do it?
theoretically, yes. - For your daughter's sake, I hope so.
Ah, the dreams I had.
all the terrible things I was going to do to that sweet child if you failed.
look, I've done everything you asked. - Not yet.
when the U. N. building vanishes...
then you will have done everything I asked.
what do you suppose they will call the crater?
the Dreyfus Ditch!
there should be no crater. - No crater?
but I want a crater. I want wreckage, twisted metal.
something the world will not forget.
they will not forget today. - They won't? Wonderful.
I have to tinkle again. Don't do anything till I get back.
too late. The countdown started.
one minute.
thirty seconds.
seven, six...
five, four...
three, two, one!
ignition!
today...
the U. N. building.
tomorrow, who knows?
I think by now that the nations of the world are aware of the
the awesome power which I control...
a power so great...
if I choose, I could wipe out an entire city.
after all, what is the life of a man...
compared to the destruction of a whole city?
I give you seven days.
seven days.
okay.
well done.
so, now we wait.
all this to get one cop?
but we have some of the finest hit men here in Europe.
in this very room. -Why don't we take care of it ourselves?
because you wouldn't stand a chance. - Come on.
you don't know Clouseau. - He can't be that good.
good? He's not good.
he's terrible. He's the worst.
there is not any man like him anywhere in the world.
compared to Clouseau, this Doomsday Machine...
is just a water pistol.
that's why it will take all the great nations...
with all of their trained assassins...
and all of their sophisticated murder weapons...
to eliminate Clouseau.
taxi, please.
this gentleman
what are you doing? - That's my case.
lucky for you, I am in a hurry. Otherwise you would have been arrested.
and when it comes to the matter of eliminating Clouseau...
nobody wants to have anybody else get the credit for it.
it's a matter of national pride.
I think we all agree, Mr. President, that we simply cannot afford...
to allow any other country to get hold of Fassbender's machine.
crazy or not, anyone who has gone to the lengths that Dreyfus has...
in order to eliminate one man...
it's reasonable to assume...
that Dreyfus will smile very kindly... on the one who eliminates Inspector Clouseau.
I think that's pretty far-fetched.
Mr. President, if I told you one week ago...
that the U. N. building would disappear...
and that a certified lunatic would blackmail the entire
you made your point. What do we do?
well, Mr. President, Clouseau is in Munich.
I ordered one of our top people to Munich yesterday.
yesterday? - Well, just in case.
he's just reported in. Clouseau has gone to the Oktoberfest.
I wonder if we have enough time before the others act.
germany's already acted, and bungled it.
according to the latest code transmission...
twelve countries have got their top assassins in Munich...
and they're all converging on the Oktoberfest.
my God, it will be like a shooting gallery.
try one of my pretzels. They're good.
what are you doing to this poor, motherless child?
you great big bully.
there, there, little boy.
sir.
I better call the President. - You know what time it is?
he wants me to call.
put me in, Coach.
what's the score?
Yes!
it's okay. How many?
Twenty-six, Mr. President.
holy cow. No wonder Dreyfus wants that Clouseau killed.
he's a one-man army. Who's left?
just the Russian and the Egyptian.
my key, please.
127, please.
good evening, Inspector Clouseau.
I couldn't sleep, and I just happened to be in the neighborhood.
I hope you don't mind.
you Frenchmen are so romantic.
thank heaven
for little girls
swine maid.
Oh, forgive me, darling. I've just washed my hands.
they must have been freezing.
freezing? Yes.
something wrong?
wrong? Oh, no.
what could be wrong?
then come back to bed.
Yes, of course.
into the bed, you know.
and take off those so-silly pajamas.
you may rest assured you will never see these so-silly pajamas again.
that I can assure you.
darling?
Yes, I won't be a moment...
darling.
hurry, darling.
I'm just going to take a bath.
a bath?
excuse me.
Yes.
Hello, this is Chief Inspector Clouseau.
there is a beautiful woman in my bed and a dead man in my bath.
if you're going to take a bath, I want to take one with you.
darling, it's freezing out here. Let me in.
I arrest you for the murder of the man in this bathtub.
what?
and I must warn you that anything you say will be taken down... and used in evidence against me
you.
who is he?
I don't know. He looks familiar.
he looks like you. - Looks like me?
Tournier, the bank robber.
what is he doing in your bathtub dressed up like you?
it is a question I could very easily ask you.
but he has been shot...
and I do not carry a gun.
obviously not, no.
I am Olga Berriossiva.
until one hour ago, I was a loyal Russian agent...
under direct order from the presidium to kill you.
to kill me?
I was considered a perfect liquidator...
because no man had ever been able to involve me emotionally...
until tonight.
do you think that you could fall in love... with an ex-Russian agent?
well, of course...
everything is possible, yes.
but you are not the same. - Huh?
Oh, well, of course...
dead men in bathtubs have been known...
to make quite a difference, you know.
anyway, this is the man who can lead me to the lunatic Dreyfus...
who it is my sworn duty to apprehend.
I, too, had a sworn duty, but I have forsaken it...
become traitor, given up everything for you.
with me...
it is the duty that comes first.
Oh, make an exception just this once.
I wish that I could.
you can. I guarantee it.
no, you see, l
look! - What?
that tattoo. When I arrested Tournier, he did not have that tattoo.
it looks like the Mondschien crest. - Mondschien?
Mm-hmm. - What is that?
an infamous family who ruled Bavaria in the 15th century.
I read somewhere that the Mondschien Castle...
had recently been sold.
you read somewhere that...
they had sold the castle?
fancy them selling the castle, just like that.
the castle!
Yes. Dreyfus.
he is in the castle.
farewell. I am off to Mondschien Castle.
must be getting a cavity.
when can my daughter and I leave?
when Clouseau is no more, perhaps.
I have done everything you asked.
you've done everything I've asked so far...
but I have not asked everything.
what you mean is that you have no intention of letting us go.
you plan to continue your reign of terror...
whether Clouseau is eliminated or not.
I must admit the thought had occurred to me.
you are mad. - And you are redundant, Professor.
redundant and fallacious. Madness does not preclude achievement.
you cannot operate the machine without me.
not yet, but when you have taught me.
and if I refuse to teach you?
then I would have to take the matter up with your charming daughter.
what kind of a man are you? - A madman.
you said so yourself. - Boss!
it's true.
when? - This morning, in his hotel room.
he's dead!
he's dead in his hotel bedroom!
Hurray! I'm free!
Oh, I'm so happy, Professor.
I'm so
good day.
my name is Professor Guy Gabroir... medieval castle authority from Marseilles.
tell me, do you have a room?
I do not know what a "reum" is.
Ah! A room!
that is what I have been saying, you idiot.
room.
does your dog bite?
nice doggy.
I thought you said your dog did not bite.
that is not my dog.
anything I can get you, boss?
I can't stand it any longer. Get me a dentist!
Dr. Shurtz lives here...
but he has gone fishing.
I don't know. I will tell him.
did I hear you say a doctor lives here?
he's a doctor and a dentist.
he made mein teeth for me.
they want him up at the castle.
up at the castle? Where can I find him?
Dr. Shurtz has gone fishing.
he probably won't be back until-- - Show me his zimmer.
hmm? - His room!
Hello!
it's Dr. Shurtz from the village, you know.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
Dr. Shurtz is here. - Where?
Ah, here, Doctor. Please hurry.
I am in agony.
all will be well soon.
did you hurt yourself? - Yes.
the burn. I can set it later.
please hurry. - First of all, I will need...
some hot water and towels.
get some hot water, Harry, and lock the door.
I don't want to be disturbed. - And lock the door, Harry.
he does not wish to be disturbed, you know.
please, Doctor, hurry. I can't stand the pain.
Yes. Now, then let me see.
Ow. - What?
my eye. - I thought it was your tooth.
but it is my tooth. - I wish you would make your mind up.
I don't normally make castle calls in the middle of the night.
doctor.
wait while l
Yes, that's
there it is.
now, open wide, please.
now, let me see.
tell me when this hurts.
is it that one?
is it that one?
Ah, there is the naughty one.
are you going to pull it? - Pull it?
Yes, of course I will pull it.
please give me something to put me out.
put you out?
Yes. Here, first you must wear...
this special anesthetic cotton wool, you know.
wear it over the eyes. On no account look out from under it.
that will ruin the whole effect of the anesthetic on the eyes.
you want me to hold it like that? - Hold it like that on the eyes...
while I get some
please hurry, Doctor. I can't stand the pain.
Yes. Coming soon.
what are you doing?
just rearranging the furniture...
in order to give you the full effect of the anesthetic.
doctor, I'm in agony!
not for much longer.
that was hell down there.
what's wrong?
whoever built this house put the stairs in the wrong place.
do you mean you fell down the stairs?
I was preoccupied with the anesthetic, you know.
it's really hot in here, isn't it?
now, the...
anesthetic.
nitrous oxide.
what's that?
that is the anesthetic, you know.
Oh, good.
Yes, it is good, yes.
please, Doctor, the pain is getting worse.
please, hurry up.
a few whiffs of this, and you won't feel a thing.
all right. - Now, breathe deeply.
how's that? - It's fine.
how do you feel?
a little dizzy.
what's so funny? - I don't know. Nothing.
then why are you laughing? - I don't know.
why are you laughing? - Because I can't help it.
Yes.
I love it.
come on. - It's gonna hurt.
good. Lovely.
I will have to use more leverage.
I don't know what you gave me, Doctor...
but it's giving me hallucinations.
your whole face has changed.
it has?
how's this?
grotesque!
we just got word, boss. Clouseau is still alive.
I knew it.
he has pulled the wrong tooth.
there's only one man who would pull the wrong tooth.
it's Clouseau.
kill him.
get Fassbender and his daughter into the control room.
what about Clouseau?
priorities. First I will pick a target.
then Clouseau.
now we'll see who has the last laugh.
they've all betrayed me, and now they will have to pay.
what shall I destroy? Buckingham Palace? Too small.
how about London? Not big enough.
England! Yes, England.
good-bye, Piccadilly
farewell, Leicester Square
you are just in time, Professor.
within five minutes, I shall destroy England.
England!
no more cricket.
no more warm beer, Professor.
no more fish and chips. No more
England!
do something.
you brought it on yourself. It's too late.
wait!
do something! Come back! Help me!
look!
you've gotta help me.
help, Professor!
Cato, my little yellow friend, I'm home.
I gave Cato the night off.
but what has happened to my room?
darling?
my darling.
darling, sing to me.
sing to you? Oh.
come to me
and the world
it will be ours tonight
where did you go?
your voice? - Yes, that was my voice.
that was my voice singing a little song we used to sing... in the Resistance to keep up the courage.
was it hard for you in the Resistance?
very hard, but not as hard as it is now.
darling, relax.
resistance is over.
my darling.
my beautiful darling.
what?
Cato! You imbecile, not now!
