hurst Street is 0.2 miles past Shari Street, if you reach San Augustine Street you've gone a little too far.
hurst also fears that the fuzz and the feds could get all this data about us, these days even without warrants.
hurst and peters, england's goalscorers in the final, watched from the bench
hurston published her first short stories at howard university.
hurston received praise for her work by both blacks and whites. But not everyone enjoyed her work.
hurston's pioneering and insightful ideas on race and gender have not only enriched the expression and meaning of black literature, but also generated positive and profound influence on the sound development of black people and particularly on the self-realization of black women.
hurstwood and vance had gone their separate ways nearly an hour before.
hurstwood arose and gathered up his small grip.
hurstwood at first sympathised with the demands of these men--indeed, it is a question whether he did not always sympathise with them to the end, belie him as his actions might.
hurstwood became more weary waiting.
hurstwood breathed freely when he saw the barns.
hurstwood ceased talking, and went with drouet and his friend sagar morrison around to the box.
hurstwood could scarcely refrain from showing that he knew of this chap's presence.
hurstwood dressed as nicely as usual, but they were the same clothes he had in canada.
hurstwood found that he could not talk, repressed as he was, and grudging drouet every moment of his presence, he bowed himself out with the elegance of a faust.
hurstwood gazed at it a moment, snuffling and hunching one shoulder, as if something were scratching him. He was so run down, however, that his mind was not exactly clear.
hurstwood gazed at it a moment, snuffling and hunching one shoulder, as if something were scratching him.
hurstwood had already left the house.
hurstwood heard the details of the weary and unavailing search that evening.
hurstwood listened with some astonishment.
hurstwood looked at his lovely prize.
hurstwood looked, but there was no face there now.
hurstwood moved his eyes over the paper slowly, but said nothing.
hurstwood moved with the line. Across fifth avenue, through madison square by the winding paths, east on twenty-third street, and down third avenue wound the long, serpentine company.
hurstwood nerved himself and sidled near.
hurstwood only looked at her.
hurstwood pretended not to see him.
hurstwood pricked up his ears.
hurstwood purposed to appeal to him.
hurstwood ran the car close and stopped.
hurstwood reasoned, when he neared the last ten dollars, that he had better keep a little pocket change and not become wholly dependent for car-fare, shaves, and the like;
hurstwood recognised cargill, the owner of the large stables in chicago of the same name, whom he had last seen at avery hall, the night carrie appeared there.
hurstwood saw the difficulty of this thing, and yet it did not seem so terrible.
hurstwood shook hands with them most cordially. He was very roseate physically.
hurstwood smiled grimly, and the boy laughed.
hurstwood stood placidly by, while the car rolled back into the yard.
hurstwood took the alarm of the paper and sat still.
hurstwood was already confronted, and recognised his friend kenny, the stock-broker.
hurstwood was home before her.
hurstwood was interestedly remarking to carrie.
hurstwood was just strolling up the street, from the flat, toward sixth avenue.
hurstwood was now hot and waked up.
hurstwood was something of a romanticist after his kind.
hurstwood went back through the barns and out into a large, enclosed lot, where were a series of tracks and loops.
hurstwood went into the barn and sought a car step, pulling out his paper-wrapped lunch from his pocket.
hurstwood went toward the car and stepped nervously on.
hurstwood's glance was as effective as the spoken words of a lover, and more.
hurstwood, on the contrary, saw in the strength of her new attractiveness his miserable predicament.
hurstwood, still tactful in distress, added nothing to this.

privacy Policy
privacy advocate harley geiger of the center for democracy and technology says drones are basically flying video cameras.
privacy advocates fear that fingerprints and other identifiers can be used improperly by authorities, catching innocents in government dragnets.
privacy advocates fear that foursquare, along with other geolocation apps such as gowalla and google latitude, are vulnerable to "data scraping," namely, the sophisticated trawling and monitoring of user activity in an effort to build a rich database of personal information.
privacy advocates have previously sounded alarms about the practices of internet companies and provided vague estimates about the volume of data they collect, but they did not give comprehensive figures.
privacy advocates objected to the policy--which is set to go into effect march 1.
