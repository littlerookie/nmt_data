mousavi also called for a national strike if he is arrested, a witness said.
mousavi backed by the former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani, a pragmatist who favours a less confrontational foreign policy warned that the government will face a "crisis of legitimacy" if the current impasse is unresolved.
mousavi claimed that, on friday night, he had been informed by the interior ministry that he had won the election convincingly.
mousavi had attempted to cancel the rally after receiving warnings that militias responsible for policing it would be equipped with live ammunition.
mousavi is running neck and neck with incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad and despite the support of former reformist president mohammed khatami, many analysts say he is fighting an uphill battle, because iran's supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei is tacitly supporting mr. ahmadinejad.
mousavi supporters are predominantly young and urbane.
mousavi urged his supporters to stay away from the square "to protect lives" and avoid being attacked by supporters and militias supporting ahmadinejad.
mousavi's slick campaign galvanised an apathetic electorate and raised hopes of a more stable economy and more liberty at home as well as better relations abroad.
mousavi, 67, who was iran's prime minister during the 1980s, has a reputation for being incorrupt.
