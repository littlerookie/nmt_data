everyone knows you can do it. - What do you mean?
by surface transport? - It doesn't sound very much, does it?
I could go round the world in 80 days, But that's not really what you're doing.
I think you're celebrating travel.
the night before we sail, I throw a farewell dinner for my referees.
if you travel by plane, there's no sensation Of having got anywhere.
I took my mother to New York by Concorde.
we got to New York and she said, "Right, yes?
I said, "You've been across the Atlantic In 2 hours 59 minutes! It's incredible!
she said, "Right. Where now?
it's the same time it takes To get from Suffolk to London.
but is there any element of risk here? Or is it all planned ahead?
no, it's planned. The BBC - the fools! - Have worked out,
they've made contact with people In the various ports.
everybody, including the shipping agents In the ports, say the boats can be held up.
what we need, what we definitely need Is proof. Visible proof.
you need something I can get from those Places that I can't get in Carnaby Street.
I'd like something rather selfish.
phyllida and I are having our first baby And we're told
that it is to be born on the 8th of April.
so, I'd like a top-class astrological chart For a baby born on 8th April next year.
I don't want any of these computer things. I want the real thing and in English.
where can I get these? - Hong Kong, Singapore and India.
I would love a glazed Chinese tile.
a roofing tile. - That's great.
that would be wonderful. The kind used in the Forbidden City.
you are all presuming that I will get At least as far as Singapore
without checking up on me at all, right?
why check up on you, Michael? We take it on trust.
you trust me. And you should, Because you're my friends!
we trust you, Michael. We don't trust the BBC.
just because you work for Granada!
he didn't mean that! We do trust the BBC! - Very sorry.
he works for Granada. He's a bit Of an argumentative character.
carry on.
tell you what, the first part Of your journey is by the Orient Express.
thus far, the problems of circumnavigation Are confined to tying a bow tie.
as we hurry on towards Paris, I can't help feeling a little complacent.
all this conviviality is infectious.
this is not a working trip, Not just a journey.
people are here to have fun.
there are no train telephones, Briefcases or calculators.
the biggest decision is likely to be The choice of wine.
is it fine? - It's very fine.
thank you, sir. - Quite excellent.
I'd say it was an... 1986... Sancerre, Am I right?
just a little knack i've picked up Over the years!
reading, it's called! - Even I got that one!
the partying persists long into the night.
I should be learning Arabic Or checking schedules,
but I think it's too late for all that.
I'm going to London, but the long way round.
where do you go from Venice?
well, I go all over the place.
um... Singapore, then up through China, Japan, through the States,
and we end up at Halifax, Nova Scotia.
how do you get from there back to London?
hopefully, by boat. Have you any alternatives?
we have a pipeline.
Oh, you're the pipeline people We've heard about!
how can that help me? - We can flush you back from Nova Scotia!
a fitting end to my career - Flushed down the Atlantic!
is there a pipeline under the Atlantic?
they tell me so, yes. You can try it first.
you should know. You're pipeline buffs!
I think this is all... Yes, yes.
move on. - Yes, move on.
I feel like going to bed. I think Those little bedrooms are terrific.
they are.
if you like sleeping on top of each other.
Yes, I'm not averse to that at all!
but... Not tonight, Josephine.
my steward Geoff, bringer of comfort And respecter of hangovers,
wakes me gently.
good morning. - Oh, sunshine!
how are you this morning? It's a beautiful day outside.
where are we? - Just outside Zurich.
Zurich. Oh, there it is!
no cloud.
beautiful.
Thanks. Going round the world Is a doddle, isn't it?
that's the morning paper, sir.
whenever you'd like me to do the beds, Just give me a call.
I could stay here for 80 days, really. I don't want to get off.
black coffee and cool fresh mountain air Combine to clear my head.
fantastic!
we're into the Alps, the sun is shining
and, most important, We're heading east all the time.
I've flushed England out of my system.
there's no need to look back now.
can you tell me something?
what I love about these compartments Is that the craftsmanship is so good.
I saw on the end a plaque Saying this was a brothel.
how long ago? - In Limoges in 1942-1945.
used by the German army in Limoges.
a mobile brothel or stationary? - Stationary. At a station.
for the officers only. - I see you've kept the red lamps.
and the large toilet with mirrors Down the hallway.
we're clocking off the countries Encouragingly.
switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria... Then the first piece of bad news.
good morning, the mistre d' will come to your Cabin shortly to take brunch reservations.
there will be an industrial strike By Italian railways,
therefore the transfer between Innsbruck And venice will be by coach. Thank you.
it would have to be today of all days That the Venice-Simplon Orient Express
will see neither Venice nor Simplon.
Innsbruck, Austria - an ignominious end To a glorious journey
and a start to an new adventure
for everyone.
Ethel?
Ethel... This is five.
weariness returns.
day Two and things Have already gone wrong.
the charm of Venice Soothes my furrowed brow.
but this is not the Grand Canal.
ominously, it's the Calle de Misericordia - Pity Street.
why is it that Even in such faded surroundings
the Italian male manages to make Everyone else look like Worzel Gummidge?
but I'm here. I have a bed, a bath and...
a room with a view.
Grazie. - Prego.
it's an intimate view, admittedly.
probably of greatest interest To roofing contractors,
but it's away from the crowds and the sights... And almost everything, really.
still, I think i've seen enough sights For one day.
the ferry to Alexandria leaves in the evening,
so I have time to see a little more of Venice.
and early in the morning, Out of season, is the perfect time.
many of her citizens are still asleep As I explore a few side alleys
in search of a different way to see the city.
everyone has seen Venice in front of a singing Gondolier or squashed in a launch.
but there are other Venetians who know The canals just as intimately.
after some friendly persuasion, A group of them agree to take me on.
Michael. - Reno.
Francesco.
for a few hours I become
a temporary unpaid auxiliary With the Venice Sanitation Department.
francesco is the leader of my gang.
he's 48 years old. His teenage children won't Be able to afford to live in Venice.
as he says, even the rubbish Isn't cheap here any more.
as we ply the canals, Collecting Venetian disposables,
I feel a sense of superiority over The expensive launches and gondolas.
we know they know we're indispensable.
this is the way to see Venice. Gondolas, no.
there must be a few Old rubbish clearing songs.
Ah, Sheffield Wednesday!
what's this? "Gianello Giancarlo...
io Gianello Francesco! - Really?
Gianello Giancarlo! - So it could be yours.
quattro passe... - De Giudecca.
Ah, it's a running cup.
he's obviously given up his career now.
apart from the off chance of a fragment Of a Tintoretto or Titian turning up,
garbage collecting, even in Venice, Is boring work.
but, as canal dwellers know, There's plenty of camaraderie.
there's even a dustman's song.
uno, due, tre...
I don't know Italian, but I know it's filthy!
sign them up! Thank you. Here are the gloves.
I would love to take them, But I am travelling light.
Bye.
AARGHH!
only in Venice could this be a post office.
this merchant's headquarters is nearly 500 years old and still doing business.
time to send back my dinner jacket And that "lovely" little good luck card!
Marco Polo may have had spare room When he set out from Venice, but I haven't.
nor do I leave in a blaze of glory From the steps of St Mark's Square,
but from the neglected backside of Venice - The docks of San Marguerita at 10 p. m.
the ferry Espresso Egitto goes from Venice To Alexandria once every ten days.
it's almost empty. That's how much Air travel has changed things.
for those of us sensible enough To have chosen a leisurely pace,
the rewards are a sense of ease And relaxation.
that is, until I try to find my cabin In the bowels of the ship.
this is ridiculous! I've got find my way round the world!
Hello?
Hello, love!
Yes, I'm on board ship. I'm in the wireless Operator's cabin on the Espresso Egitto.
how are you?
all right. I'm very well.
sorry I haven't rung before. I've just not stopped.
we're sailing leisurely Through the Gulf of Corinth
and it's all sunny and... Well, I won't make you jealous.
we're going on to Athens briefly later today
and then I'll be in Cairo... Gosh, I think Sometime around Saturday morning.
what?
no, I'm not behind. No, on schedule. Don't be like that.
when we get to Cairo, we'll have done 2, 000 Miles - about 12th of the circumnavigation.
sheffield United beat Newcastle? What?
passepartout, not interested in football,
is getting bored and prowls the deck In search of innocent victims.
swine!
it's only near land That sea travel becomes interesting.
in the Corinth Canal, it becomes spectacular!
the drama begins with the boarding Of no less than three pilots to guide us!
as we approach, the road is lowered Beneath the water to let us pass.
the mouth of the canal Is like the narrowest eye of a needle.
from a distance, The operation looks impossible.
even when we're inside, I can't quite believe It isn't a Cecil B De Mille special effect.
it'll take all the skill of our captain, The three pilots and a tugboat
to get us through The four-mile canal in one hour.
the French engineers who dug the canal Took 12 years over it.
it was opened in 1893, 20 years too late For Jules Verne to use.
as it was, he put Fogg on the SS Mongolia,
which went from Brindisi straight to Bombay, Missing Greece altogether.
I have time for a flying visit to Athens.
it's just long enough to catch a glimpse of One of the world's more remarkable armies.
they are the elite presidential guard, Known splendidly as the Evzones.
God help those who giggle at their get-up.
above the pom-poms are tough men indeed.
amongst their duties is the mounting Of a guard at the national memorial.
they seem to do even this In the most complicated way possible.
those foot movements. I've never seen anyone marching like that.
where do those derive from?
they are the traditional steps That the Evzones do.
they go from generation to generation.
they do it like this for years and years.
what qualifications do you need To become an Evzone?
you must be over 1. 85 metres in height.
you must have a good character, Moral outlook and good morals.
the foustanella, what is that?
the foustanella is a special type of kilt.
it has 400 folds representing the 400 years Of the Ottoman occupation.
this outfit you wear Takes a long time to put on.
two people put it on together. Why is that?
because one of them Is not able to do it by his own.
so he needs help from the second one.
it takes about one hour To dress both of them.
they have one part for summer, they wear In summer, and another for winter.
terribly hot.
the stockings and shoes they wear all year.
during the summer it is, But they have to take it.
now our duties are mostly ceremonial,
but the Evzones are trained in their units Before coming here in battle fighting,
so they are also good soldiers.
as it happens, it's not only the Evzones Who are on display.
how are you?! - Very well.
I love you! - Oh, that's nice.
I have every single tape of Monty Python.
I loved you in "A Fish Called Wanda."
and you've never met me before. - I love you!
they'll never believe this. They'll think we've rehearsed this.
do the stuttering, please!
no, no. I don't have my script. - Please, please!
after a year I'm allowed to do it. - I loved it! I'm so excited!
so what are you doing here? - I think I came to see you.
I've got every Monty Python... I've got "Monty Python and the Holy Grail," too.
that's... I think you deserve Some sort of reward.
this encounter with my previous life
reminds me that going round the world In 80 days is quite sane compared to that.
so I leave Greece and tick off Another ex-empire on the way.
britain and Venice are behind me, Crete and Egypt are ahead.
the Espresso Egitto has filled up.
there are now 300 passengers For Franco and his team to cook for.
he needs all the help he can get.
I'll do it now. That looks satisfying.
franco's one-man bakery sets a furious pace.
he has been doing it 27 years.
it is slightly like Dirty Fidos. I'm sure you have them in Italy.
and a twiddle? Speciality of yours, Franco?
Specialiste?
you're vetting them and getting rid Of all mine, aren't you?
now, i'll do one here.
I'll make a big "P."
a bit egotistical, I know, But let's see if it'll work.
how about that?
there we are, a "P." Blob at the end for an artistic touch.
there we are... A nice "P."
how about that?
this bit's boring, so go and film some Arty shots of sea while I have some Chianti.
that's enough of that!
my last meal in Europe.
the matre d', Eros, Presents me with my handiwork.
alas, it no longer resembles a "P." He hands It to me as if he'd found it on the floor!
wonderful!
pie? - Pie?
and... Er...
tonight I treat myself to the works.
hors d'oeuvres, risotto, cheese, Profiteroles...
red and white wine - a grand Euro blowout!
farewell to the familiar.
from tomorrow, not only the food,
but the culture, surroundings, life itself, Will be very different.
Hello? Ah, hello! This is Jabberwocky.
this is Jabberwocky.
Yes, is that Coutts Bank?
is that Coutts Bank?
Yeah. This is Jabberwocky!
reporting from 35. 24 north, 25. 44 east.
urgent...
Ah, well, can you tell her it is Jabberwocky?
hello... Jabberwocky!
I have a problem. We are about to enter Egypt.
you told me not to take any money into Egypt, It was illegal to take money into Egypt.
someone on the boat says it is legal To take money into Egypt in advance.
request advise. This is Jabberwocky.
this leisurely crossing of Europe
has been only a rehearsal for what lies ahead.
with 74 days left, I'm about to enter a world
where things no longer happen The way they do at home.
Yes, you're right, we never left home.
Bay of Bengal, Bombay, Cairo, All back projection.
this is shot on location... In Sunningdale.
actually, this place was built By a very rich man called Sassoon,
who made his money in China, but wanted People to think he still lived in England.
with a place like this, how can I persuade you I'm in Shanghai?
you'll just have to follow me.
if the suburban villas of Shanghai Resemble Sunningdale,
the grand waterfront, called the "Bund," Could be Westminster or Merseyside.
the reason for such nostalgic parody
is the opium trade.
it led to the western commercial presence here,
which reached a peak of confidence In the 1920s and 30s,
when the Europeans Tried to rebuild Shanghai in their likeness.
there is a regular sea connection From here to Japan,
but it sails only once a week.
I phone the shipping office in trepidation.
but the ferry is in port. I can see it From my window in the Peace Hotel.
it leaves tomorrow.
for Basil and I, it's our last day together.
he's returning to Hong Kong To his wife and new baby.
we dip into the side streets. Shanghai is the largest city in China.
the population is 12 million, so it is, Not surprisingly, labour intensive.
everyone has something to do - sweeping, Selling, cooking, or being a bicycle man.
though the street atmosphere Appears medieval,
there is a trickle of modern goods.
you can buy an electronic calculator,
but the price Will still be added up on an abacus.
47 days of continual movement is sapping The few reserves of energy I have left.
basil recommends a local pick-me-up.
this is the... Hello! ...tiredness and fatigue counter?
do I get a sample?
everything from baldness to impotence Has been treated here for over 200 years,
so there must be something in it, But what exactly?
what is this? - Chi.
Ah, that is good for your chi.
my chi? - It is regenerating.
you know, they believe That it all comes from here.
and then it goes around your body.
this is better than stuff in a bottle? - Oh, yeah.
because it cures the source of the problem.
the pills, generally, just give you... Give you instant gratification.
I'd love to know what they all are.
I'll get you a list.
three times every day. - Three times a day.
for how many days?
er... Three days.
I can't wait to take it and see the effect.
many Chinese learn English.
the chance to try it out is an event.
do you know the BBC? - I know.
do you know what it? - BBC is British Broadcast Company.
how do you know about the BBC?
bbc is the famous broadcaster Radio in the world.
sometimes I see the programmes of BBC On our television.
Yes. - And sometimes I listen to radio.
bbc short wave. - Short wave!
short wave, that's right. I try to use it for the football results.
I like English very much. - Do you?
where did you learn English?
I learned it in my home from radio and TV.
...According to my job and occupation.
my occupation is little. - What is your occupation?
accountant on the public bus. "Fares, please! Here is your change.
I don't think you would get many bus Conductors in London who spoke Chinese.
this curiosity about the west may stem From the fact that, 60 years ago,
shanghai was an international city.
nod Coward wrote "Private Lives" here and The nightclubs played the new American jazz.
now these men, old enough To have seen Nod Coward out walking,
play to a new audience
earnest, appreciative and a little dull.
but some people still come to Shanghai For a good time.
this Australian couple visit every year.
they love Shanghai and they love the band.
and the band, all retired players From the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra,
love American jazz!
but sitting here at the Peace Hotel On a Thursday, it's all very polite.
a far cry from the 30s, those decadent days When Shanghai was the Havana of the east.
do you have A favourite jazz band of your own?
I like Harry James.
Harry James. A trumpet player like you. Very good.
and Benny Goodman. - Yes, yeah.
do you have a family yourself? Do you have sons or daughters?
Yes, i've got a son. He works in Shanghai Symphony Orchestra.
he plays viola.
is he... Does he also play jazz?
no, he play only classical!
it's a terrific sound!
thank you.
thank you.
after a day of postcard writing, Chinese Laundry and a farewell drink with Basil,
it's time to move on.
as ever, I view departures With mixed feelings.
they are good for my timekeeping, But come too soon.
to leave China And have seen so little is a waste.
however, I am now only six days Behind Fogg,
and he'd lost his Passepartout, Who got drunk in Hong Kong.
my Passepartout got drunk in Hong Kong, But he's still here.
great to be back on boats again.
there is something of unequalled Excitement about being on a boat...
...at the moment of departure.
a new temporary home, a cosy little cabin, A new sea, a new country at the end of it.
probably all go wrong, but at the moment I must confess to extreme excitement.
I know I'm prone to excitement, But it's still great to be on board.
I'm only doing this so the cameraman Can get the sunset, so i'll leave you to it.
all yours, Nigel.
over there, the sunset. Big red thing behind the building.
nice, isn't it? I love a nice big sunset. Going down there.
dipping behind the building. Lovely! Anyway, i'll get out of your way!
so I leave China as I arrived - by river.
it does seem appropriate.
rivers are so important here - Irrigation, trading routes,
and in floods, they sometimes bring Immense destruction.
in a few miles, We will join the great Yangtse,
which will carry us out into the East China Sea and on a two-day journey
into the Pacific Ocean and north To the port of Yokohama in Japan.
hello. - Hello.
next morning, back on the high seas,
I take breakfast in the coffee shop Of the Jian Zhen.
I try to glean information about why a Service between two such populous countries
should run only once a week. What is it all about?
can you tell me, is this a Japanese boat?
no, a Chinese boat.
Ah, sorry. So, you and the crew are Chinese?
Yes.
but the passengers are Japanese. - Japanese and Chinese.
where are all the passengers?
is this a very quiet boat?
at the moment? Yes?
the sea is very calm at the moment.
sometimes. - Sometimes it is rough?
Yes. - Feel seasick?
never mind.
thank you.
am I still asleep?
this surely must be a dream.
the decor, the music, the conversation.
maybe I died on the Yangtse And I'm in a Sino-Japanese heaven.
then it dawns on me. Of course! I was lucky enough to have a cabin.
the majority of the 650 berths on this ship Are down below in tatami class.
this is where everyone will be.
Ah, wrong again.
Oh, well, I suppose there's only one thing To do, that's go to sleep again.
sardine class, here!
that's quite comfortable.
if you don't move, turn over, Stretch out for a glass of water...
sorry!
now I know why Joseph Conrad Wrote so much on the China Seas.
there's nothing else to do.
Yes, come in.
how do you do? - How do you do?
would you care for some hot water?
Oh, anything that is going. - Thank you.
for medicine. Chinese medicine.
thank you very much.
Bye. - Bye-bye.
the mind might be going, But there's a chance I can save the body.
my collection of ginseng roots, dried mosses And other bits of countryside
looks even more like builder's rubble This morning.
still, it's been tested Over a period of 4, 000 years,
must give it the edge on laboratory stuff.
add a little hot water, Courtesy of the management...
...stir it all with decadent western pen...
...and wait.
ideally, for about 1, 000 years, But I haven't time for that, so here goes.
here comes the moment of truth.
it's a lovely shade of yellow.
tastes like distilled woodland!
bit of earth thrown in.
you can't rejuvenate overnight, Not at my age.
just when I'm beginning to feel the benefit, It's time to face country 16 - Japan.
its ships, like the economy, Are big and powerful,
bringing in the oil, taking out the cars.
not one, but two tugs come alongside To shepherd us into Yokohama.
they even removed a bit of bridge To let us through.
the odd choice of Sousa marches To welcome us
is my first sign of Japanese Fascination with things American,
which, in view of their past differences - Pearl Harbor, Hiroshima - is ironic.
phileas Fogg arrived in Yokohama On November 14, 1872,
exactly 116 years ago, to the day.
when Fogg arrived in any port, There was an on-service that day.
now there are no passenger services Across the Pacific at all.
I must head for Tokyo And the shipping agencies.
the bullet trains glide in Like wingless aircraft every 20 minutes.
the doors slide open for exactly 30 seconds,
so God help you if you have a double bass And a set of golf clubs.
it's like an aircraft inside, as well.
once the acceleration begins, I find myself Instinctively tighten for take off.
the Shinkansen, which means New Railway,
speeds at 150 mph Right across Japan's main island.
it was the first quantum leap in railway Technology since the age of steam.
it's the fastest I've travelled on my journey.
if there had been a Shinkansen in China, I might have saved days!
as it is, Yokohama to Tokyo takes 15 minutes.
shimbashi station.
don't panic.
well, here we are.
up with the faithful bag again, And out into another city.
tokyo, population nine million, language Incomprehensible, alphabet indecipherable.
Haisu, central exit?
I hope you're not following me. I don't know where I'm going.
I feel like a tramp down here under the city
amongst the immaculately Turned out Japanese.
perhaps I'm doomed to wander These well-polished halls forever,
proof of the awful fate awaiting Those that can't organise their life
the way the Japanese do.
Oh, hello, is that David Powers?
Yes, it is. - It's Michael Palin.
what are you doing here? - It's a long story, I can't tell you now.
I'm really only here for about 24 hours.
can we meet up? I know nothing of this place.
I'd love to have you show me around. - That would be fine.
how about this evening? - That's good. Whereabouts should we meet?
that's always a problem in Tokyo.
we could meet places where we'd spend The evening trying to find each other.
I eventually meet David Powers, A BBC journalist living in Tokyo,
at a self-service sushi bar,
which, like everything in Japan, Is rather clever.
first, take your tea and a tea bag.
tea, as well? - Yes, all do-it-yourself.
hot water in there. - Ingenious, isn't it?
the country that made the Sony Walkman.
then, just take whatever you fancy.
that's a mackerel one there.
is this sushi or sashimi? - That's sushi.
sushi is the stuff on top of rice balls.
does it have to be raw fish? - Not necessarily raw.
that is actually slightly boiled.
can I try one? What's that?
that one is... Sea urchin.
that is raw. - i've taken it now.
I keep thinking We should be putting things back on.
you can't send your empties back.
you stack your plates, they count them And that's your bill at the end.
everything, same price.
how difficult is it to learn Japanese?
it's a bit of a mind-bender, Japanese.
it's one of the most difficult languages.
partly because of how it is written - Chinese characters and their own characters.
each word has different ways Of being pronounced
depending on where it is in a sentence.
some can be pronounced 20 ways.
you just have to know Which part of a sentence it's in.
worse than English.
we think with spelling in English we have Problems - the Japanese really do!
ironically, Japanese words Are now some of the most familiar world-wide.
the Japanese are like magpies - picking up Bits of design, inventions, language,
mixing them With their own talent for production
to produce something everyone wants.
being in control is an important part Of the Japanese character.
but in the evenings, they like to be out of it.
to help them are geishas, restaurants And the phenomenon of the karaoke bar.
karaoke, meaning "empty orchestra," Began 20 years ago
as a way of allying sophisticated technology
with the unsophisticated Japanese urge To sing in public.
for under 1. 00, you can choose a song From 2, 000 stored on laser disc,
with a backing singer And video thrown in free.
it's terrifying! - No, it's fascinating.
I enjoy it. - Will you sing?
certainly, and you will, too.
no, no. - Oh, yes. You have to sing for your supper.
mind you, the whisky they drink To go with it is about 60 a bottle.
at that price, it's not surprising that it Takes very little to make everyone happy.
they take it seriously. Have they rehearsed, do you think?
they go straight into it.
a lot of people have this equipment at home.
I see. - Some of my relatives do.
they practise before going out.
I'm told that these men, Sales managers and accountants by day,
Tom Jones by night, practise at home For hours to get their presentation right.
but you can't go wrong. No one's allowed To spoil the party. You must have fun!
I begin to sense the remorseless And unavoidable tide of fun flowing my way.
I don't know where the back door is. I don't even know where the front door is!
for old times' sake, I choose a song I heard the band play in Shanghai.
# You are my sunshine, my only sunshine # You'll never know, dear, How much I love you # Please don't take my... My sunshine away # You are my sunshine, my only sunshine # You make me happy when skies are grey # You'll never know, dear, How much I love you # Oh, please don't take my sunshine away!
# Oh, please don't take my sunshine away!
Yeah! #... My sunshine away! #
my partner takes a well deserved bow.
I choose disembowelment, But the club isn't licensed,
so they give me the next best thing.
Mrs Thatcher would approve Of Tokyo at night.
the streets are clean, Mugging is almost unknown,
and if you get too drunk to go home,
the Japanese system will provide A system as neat as a Sony Walkman.
it's a capsule hotel.
the over-karaokied businessman Who missed his last train
can get a room for the night.
if you abide by the rules, you'll get a bargain.
how much is it? - About 18 for the night.
you get the Sony, you get the place to stay, You get a shaving kit, all thrown in.
it is good. - It is, but make sure you look at the rules.
persons whose bodies are tattooed Should keep out.
that's usually gangsters in Japan.
dead drunks are requested to keep out.
if you're dead, you'll probably do that.
persons in sandals should keep out." Why's that?
dirty feet. - Dirty feet?
Jesus Christ would have no chance. It's a lot to remember if you're dead drunk!
this sobers you up, just the...
I wonder if there is anything nasty in Japan.
any dirty corners, Anything that doesn't work.
I mean, your average English inebriate Has enough trouble with a white line!
are these the rooms? - No, a little bigger than that.
here comes the piece-de-resistance.
your Tokyo nightwear! - Very restful.
very fetching. - Very restful, nice quiet colours
once processed, all you have to do Is find the room.
believe me, they are easy to miss.
I'm upstairs.
aren't you the lucky one?
how the hell do you get in it? - It's like a luxury morgue.
actually, it's a triumph of miniaturisation.
if you can say that, you should be in here!
good night. - It's very comfortable.
now, cooking time. How long do I need?
it's a video.
an in-coffin video!
Oh, dear, it's the late news.
got the same channel as I have on? Very instructional, isn't it?
glad we haven't got the cameras here!
unbelievable!
good morning, is Mr Nakajima there, please?
Hello, is that Mr Nakajima?
Ah, hello. It's Michael Palin from the BBC.
mr Nakajima sends me to Tokyo docks To ask for the Neptune Garnet.
here she is. A big, fat, well-used vessel, 43, 000 tonnes, 3, 000 containers, 11 storeys high.
but all that matters to me Is she sails for America tonight.
tomorrow morning, I'll look out at the Pacific Ocean.
well, it's there somewhere.
and that's my view for the next 11 days.
11 days! That's longer Than most of our family holidays.
what is there to do?
well, whatever you do on holiday, I suppose.
read all the books you've been Meaning to read for the last 15 years...
...enjoy the local food and drink...
...write a few letters To make them jealous back home...
...and get out and about And make some new friends.
where shall I start? Meeting room sounds promising.
hmm, perhaps everyone is on deck.
how about the games room?
Nope.
I know. They'll all be watching TV.
Ah, the ship's noticeboard.
that should give me a few clues To life aboard the Marie Celeste.
Ah, the ship's mess, of course! That's where they'll all be.
well, two of them, at least.
and one of them is the captain, An Indian, Suresh Amirapu.
especially on this journey, I have been Rushing through places.
from Hong Kong to Japan, We did in about ten days.
so, suddenly to come to this, Everything seems to grind to a halt.
time stretches ahead of us.
actually, that is very characteristic Of passenger ship life.
extremes. In port, we get very busy.
we're there a short time, And then we have a long sea stretch.
what you mentioned Is very typical of sea life.
I am obsessed by times and schedules Because of the 80 days.
did we leave Tokyo on schedule?
just a couple of hours behind schedule.
but we hope to make that up on the way. We should be in Long Beach on time.
will we see any land? - No, next landfall will be California.
very good food. Good sate.
so, how long does this boat take to... You just go round the world?
Yes, we go round the world. We are on a fixed schedule.
we take 63 days. - 63 days!
rotten swine!
a bit faster than you are.
much faster.
63 days of staring out At a view of America's trade deficit
would cure me of circumnavigating forever!
the weather's getting worse.
captain, can you tell me, how do you know
whether the storms or bad weather Is going to be on any one day?
we get weather information And reports by radio.
we also have weather charts like this.
this is Japan, And most of the lows are up here.
there are gale warnings there, too, So we are staying south.
we're avoiding the worst weather.
I am measuring now the wind direction.
I'm using a device called a handkerchief.
this was used by Lord Beaufort, Who discovered wind early this century.
he named the various winds from one to 18.
you can tell from how far the hanky blows Just how strong the wind will be.
so I am now going to let the hanky go,
and work out how strong This gale that will hit us is going to be.
remember, Lord Beaufort, discoverer of wind, After dinner, July 30th, 1909.
I'll drop the hanky now.
as you can see, the wind Is not quite as violent as we'd thought.
it is blowing at about...
just calculate, one knot!
it is actually nearer 40 knots
and a force eight gale.
the Pacific is not living up to its name.
the only consolation Is that Phileas Fogg crossed all this
in a paddle steamer at half our speed.
for the first time, I am catching him up.
even the containers sound depressed today,
straining at their moorings, They produce groans
strangely akin to a Stockhausen symphony.
there's only one place to be On a day like this.
in the day room, It is Roger Passepartout's birthday.
a party has been laid on At which he is one of the reluctant stars.
cabin boy!
strokes of the cat!
mimic your favourite animal at the zoo.
you have to guess what it is.
a documentary producer!
he's a colossal hit with the Singaporean crew,
but is it family entertainment? The First officer's wife and son don't seem sure.
I never knew Pass the Parcel Had such international status.
the Neptune Garnet's crew Are aiming for Olympic standards.
fix! Fix!
Ah, the... The ship's scissors!
I name this ship... Oh, they are blunt!
what do I have to do now? Read this out?
mimic any interesting personality You have met on your travels.
Ah, right... OK.
the... Er... Yugoslav deckhand.
I just hope this series Isn't sold in Yugoslavia!
otherwise, I'm a dead man!
good morning, all ship personnel.
all clocks will advance by one hour tonight.
all clocks will advance by one hour tonight. Thank you.
on our 5, 000-mile journey across the Pacific, We have eight time zones to cross.
I begin to experience ship lag, as every Night the clocks are moved on one hour.
early nights become late nights.
getting up for breakfast Is almost impossible.
life on a container ship is like being Squashed in a great big shopping basket.
it's a battle to avoid becoming like one Of the refrigerated vegetables outside.
regular exercise kills a little time.
every other night, the casino is opened For the hardened gamblers.
double four... Number 44.
two little ducklings... 22.
the next number... Number 29.
the first Christmas decorations of 1988
are a reminder, Like the ever changing clocks,
that time is moving on...
...ever so slowly.
don't think that I'm not dead butch.
I don't think there's anything pansy Or poofy or effeminate
in ironing your own shirts!
this shirt got dirty Through good honest sweat!
it got sweaty because I worked hard doing A man's job on a man's ship a man's way!
just because I like to apply an iron and get A nice crease does not mean I am poofy!
don't you pan away from me!
I think a good tight crease Is a sign of a man's private life!
if you can get your crease sharp, You can get other things sharp, too!
made a man out of me, Made a man out of my wife!
look at this machine - For clean clothes only!
stupid machine! Four or five times it had to go in there!
other people's clothes were in there At the same time, they dissolved!
underpants fell to pieces!
anyway, that's all from ironing corner.
back with flower arranging tomorrow.
and you want to see where i'll be arranging Them! Not your normal way.
in between the increasingly frequent Bouts of madness,
I sit and wish I was elsewhere.
I'd looked forward To long days on the Pacific.
it sounded a romantic concept
11 days on the world's largest ocean.
time to reflect, alone with the elements.
in reality, the weather Continues grey and hostile,
the wind blows, the ship rolls
and the Neptune Garnet Can't get there fast enough for me.
it's a sobering thought that our movement Across this vast ocean
is dependent On just one brass propeller below me,
which has to be kept turning non-stop, Day and night, for two weeks.
to try and allay my fears, I visit the engine room.
room is a misnomer. The engine is housed In a space the size of a cathedral.
it's awesome, But it still only turns one propeller
at 21 knots.
in less than a minute, this will show Our position as 180 degrees longitude,
halfway round the world, The International Dateline.
all the hours I have lost Travelling east to west
will be given back to me in one extra day,
which was, of course, What Fogg forgot until the end of his story.
I shall get two November 21sts.
but even so, it still leaves me 23 To cross the second half of the world,
and it took me 58 days to cross the first.
watch longitude east become... Longitude west.
WESTERN hemisphere. Great, isn't it?
it's my sort of hemisphere!
good evening, Ladies and gentlemen.
may I have your attention For these two announcements, please?
the first announcement...
...the clocks will be advanced By one hour tonight at midnight.
second announcement...
please note that we will have One day returned tonight.
that means that we have Another Monday tomorrow.
we will have another Monday tomorrow.
however, please don't expect that whatever Happened today will happen again tomorrow.
thank you.
anywhere else in the world, I'd have been Glad to have another November 21st,
but to be given the day again when You'd not known what to do the first time
seems quite literally a waste of time.
but you don't cross the dateline Without something happening.
november 21st Mark Two Is a day i'll not forget.
ladies and gentlemen... You are now gathered here...
...to witness our new seafaring members
undergoing series of initiation ceremonies.
this ceremony is of crossing The International Dateline.
the wretched victims, Apart from myself, are all cadets.
a Burmese, a Ghanaian and a Malay.
bring them in front of me And make them kneel!
the night before, The crew had all watched "Full Metal Jacket,"
just to perfect their technique.
your Highness, I bring you four sailors Who have crossed the International Dateline
without your permission.
and they were caught in the act By our fishy guards!
proceed with what the initiation ceremony is, As we have always carried out.
stand up!
hands over head! Hands over head, I said!
I am told They normally use paint at this point,
but because I am here, They have let us off with tomato sauce.
you, stand up! - Thought you'd get to me!
hands over head!
Ah, warm!
on a day like this, hot sauce...
you like it?! - No... Hell.
this'll do my career good!
very funny, huh? - Don't think i'll join the navy after all.
thank you. Your Highness, We have finished the baptism.
but there's more fun to come
a convivial cocktail To show there's no ill feeling.
it contains, amongst other things, coffee, Mustard, chocolate, curry powder,
two eggs, Tabasco and soy sauce.
Smashing!
smashing, eh? - Very good, yes.
he's not used to drinking.
offenders and our new seafarers,
you now will be recognised Wherever you go across the ocean,
anywhere round the world, Especially in the world of Neptune.
don't think i'll go across the Dateline Again. Once is enough for me.
very nice. I'd like to thank the caterers For laying on such a feast

you are so nosy.
come on.
I would like to emphasize several aspects of the project.
this will be thirty million square metro resort...
with two hundred residential villas.
the government has already approve our proposal.
however, only on the condition that we move from our presently proposed location behind the beach forward to the beach front itself, which will have to be completely cleared.
what! You mean we'll lose the whole beach.
Yes, that's all the government will approve, so I'm afraid we're going to have to live with it.
very well, please continue.
the entire project will take five years to complete.
I'm sorry! I just...
I can't accept this.
giving the situation, I don't see what the problem is.
very well! We'll proceed as planned.
mom, please!
let me think about it.
mr Ho, in the mean time, please prepare the necessary documents.
Yes, Mrs Brewer.

BB, you are terrific!
I love you to death.
Oh yeah!
I am like a bomber of my age,
I am on fire.
yeah...
let's stop the talk and just lift off.
Walter.
Yes, B. - Are you happy though?
I am so high. Look at all the fresh meat around, it's just like the abattoir and freshness is what matters.

Walter!
what do you want?
Where's Sharon?
she's not here, haven't seen her around.

he is our child.
Yes, you are right.
I'm your son?
sister are you sick?

sorry to be late.
but I promise I'll come.
let's go inside.
Hey! Hi!
Walter, why don't you check if he's the son from that house?
how could I see when you are spinning me around?

I don't know how to dance to this.
handsome, it's fine.
just follow me. Put your hands up.
look at the girls.
you dance pretty well.
Really?
it's ok.

Yes, that is my cousin Rachel.
the one next to her is her boyfriend, Walter.

why do you sound like you got no friends at all?
are you from Mars?
let's just say I don't have true friends.
true friends?
do you have a lot in your mind?
I'm not telling you.
that's ok. My friends are fun.
let me introduce you to them later.

Hello!

so now you are interested in man as well?
this is Tim, you know them as well.

I told you enough times, stop messing about.

your two girls from the abattoir are alright, just a bit too short tempered.
they are not what you think.

I am sorry about last time.
forget about it. Sharon's cool with it, so are we.
I haven't been so happy for a long while.
you can come here anytime.
they are all quite friendly.

I will give you a call by then. - Okay - Goodbye. - Goodbye.

I was just thinking, our business is not going anywhere.
we should make it big, two feet more than two feet it is.
you used the wrong word, not making it big, but to expand. Got it?
have you tidy your stuff?
I know!
you know doesn't mean you are doing it.
you should ask you girlfriend to look at the shop when she's free, so where is she now?
your mum went to Shenzhen to have her nose done. She said hers is not pretty now.
what are you two father and son up to today?
uncle, auntie. - Good morning, auntie.
finish practicing kung-fu?
they mastered that two years ago.
what do you want?
oranges.
$10 for five. They are a bit gone off.
but it is good for juicing, very sweet.
how can you sell things that are gone off?
it's not rotten.
I won't sell them to the others, only for you auntie.
you two are messing about.
messing about? Give you a nice one to try.
good idea.
my son, they are after me.
why are you still here?
mister, what are you doing?
uncle and aunt, what does the English say?
it is saying that they are taking our land.
taking the beach.
taking my beach means taking it up with me, Mr. Frog Eye.
you are right.
you think you are right?
listen to me.
this area is now listed under the Brewer Development Project.
what project?
a development project.
the Brewer Development is an enterprise with a conscious.
so we will offer you a reasonable compensation.
OK? - Beat them!
stop it!
you hit my fingers.
still at it?
beat him...
son, beat him! - I get!
son, beat him!
there is no point for you to go mad. We are taking the land and the beach.
eat chips! - Let's go.
get out... - Go
Walter, make some calls.
call everyone in the village, we are going to see Mrs. Brewer
and do what?
to reason!
give me back my homeland!
protect Pui Long Bay!
give me back my homeland!
this is private property.
if you don't leave we will use force.
go!
what are you talking about? All of you, want to fight me?
son, we have many people here, you don't need to fight alone.
it will hurt.
let me tell you, back then Mr. Brewer said...
the beach is for the whole village to use.
now he is gone and you guys want to take it back, what's the matter with you all?
give me back my homeland! Protect Pui Long Bay!
this is private property.
if you don't leave, I will ask my superior to call the police.
leave!
call the police?
taking back the beach is a big matter.
you cannot just put up a notice and drive us away.
it is not simple as that!
that's right. You can't buy us with money.
ask Mrs Brewer to come out, I want to talk to her.
open the gate!
ask her to come out, come out!
you villagers again? Go away.
don't make a mess here.
where are we going to swim when you demolish the beach?
where can we play beach volleyball?
play volleyball?
at most you can call it playing ball on the beach, not beach volleyball.
playing ball on the beach? Let's play a game and see what you got.
don't say anything if you don't have the guts.
want to play beach volleyball with me, okay.
let me teach you what beach volleyball is.
okay, let's do it.
not to be worried. Just put your heart in and teach them a lesson.
keep going! Keep going!
keep going! Keep going!
protect Pui Long Bay! Beat the sisters!
keep going!
Yes!
good ball! You know?
this is how you play volleyball. Keep winning.
Yes!
see, they got so intimidated that they could hardly move.
2-0! Yes!
what do they want?
I don't know. Steady, let's see what's going on.
what are they doing, posing like models.
we are in the middle of the match, aren't we playing beach volleyball?
so, you think that's enough to lead them on?
Yeah! Let's kick it in!
all right
something's up.
it is just a veil, not to worry.
the two girls are over there.
go!
move back a bit more.
don't let them lead us, otherwise we are going to lose.
we cannot lose.
reinforce the base and we strike from the back.
keep going!
keep going!
no strength at all.
Really?
Yeah!
good job!
are you playing ball or are you hitting people?
Hey! - B, are you ok?
do you two know how to play?
if not let me teach you.
volleyball is like this.
what? You really think we are playing ball on the beach?
I want a re-match!
a re-match?
you are quite thick-skinned.
not only do you not know how to play ball, you don't know how to spell.
do you know the word, "shame"?
okay I will give you a chance. We will see you at the Hong Kong Volleyball Open Match.
remember not to get kicked out too early, otherwise we won't see you again and I will...
be really upset.
come on, sis! Let's go!
we've wasted enough time here.
stop your act! Drop dead!
Oh, by the way, Tim.
you missed seeing your vixen sister's awesome victory.
it wasn't even really a match.
they were just so lame
did you really have to play so rough?
of course! We smashed them into the sand.
mom, are you really going to demolish the beach?
demolish the beach?
mom, we have so many happy memories here.
I have some happy memories of this place as well.
but it was your dad's dream.
so I think we should continue for now.
mom, no one ever said that the beach would be destroyed.
excuse me, Ma'am, Mr and Mrs To are here to see you.
Oh, really? - Yes, Ma'am.
mr To, Mrs To
Mrs. Brewer.
please sit down.
say hello.
uncle, auntie!
haven't seen you for a long time, how are you?
same old.
how are you Mrs. Brewer?
I am fine thank you.
you are not here visiting me this time aren't you?
could you not take the beach back?
I understand.
I will ensure you the compensation for everyone is a good one.
Mrs Brewer, I think money is not the question here.
I understand.
we all live here for a very long time we have feelings for the place.
I myself am for one.
if it was not because of you...
the most important matter...
now is to sort things out.
you guys lost the match, so what do you want?
Natalie! We adults are talking.
sorry about that.
you will lose again even if we play again ten times.
what if we won?
if you won, we won't take back the beach.
well if we could sort things out with a match...
we will accept.
if Mrs Brewer doesn't find the idea childish.
I think this could me the only solution at the moment.
good, that's a deal.
I will sort out the villagers.
if you won, we can discuss the details later.
thank you Mrs Brewer.
thank you!
no need to thank me. If you won, you earned it.
or maybe that was what my late husband would have wanted.
they really want to do that?
her husband was like a brother to me.
back then when the two of them got kidnapped, if it wasn't us who rescued her, she would have been dead.
she owes me one.
don't say that. It was an accident.
after that incident, they didn't ask us to pay the rent, and we have been living here ever since.
there is no need to talk about it anymore.
what is more important is to think how to win them.
we would try anything at this moment.
Yes. Walter, what do you say?
last time they were...
to be honest, you two do not play as good as the two sisters.
it's you.
just taught them the basic technique. They don't have the stagmania.
when I try, you said I was being too rough.
what about you then?
I think it should be my turn to teach them how to play beach volleyball.
beach volleyball?
you can stand firmly on the ground, not play volleyball.
beach volleyball, not kung-fu.
do you have some tricks up your sleeves?
of course I do, but I am just worried if the girls can take it.
what's important is for us to keep the beach.
winning only counts in each match.
we will win this one.
that's right.
old Lam, I am To.
what's up?
there is something I need your help.
where is Natasha?
stuck in a meeting as usual, but this is from me and her.
happy Birthday! - Thanks
can I open it?
open it.
how do you know I wanted this?
come on, we know our brother's taste in watches.
Really?
but maybe that not in women.
so, who are you all dressed up for?
nobody.
Oh, really?
and when do your loving sisters get to meet this girl called nobody?
never. I'm not going to let you two scare her away,
Iike you always do.
Oh, come on! We never mean to.
I know, so fierce!
Hey, what man would dare to date you?
Oh, there are plenty. I'm just playing hard to get.
no way! Let me find a good man for you.
Oh, really, and from where? All of your little friends?
I don't think so.
Oh, hey, you don't want to keep nobody waiting for somebody.
I won't. OK. - Go - Bye. - Have fun, bye - Thanks again for the watch. - Yeah...go.
happy Birthday! Bye!
you don't like it here?
no.
maybe I am just not used to it.
about yesterday, in fact...
about Rachel being injured?
I am sorry.
it has nothing to do with you.
the beach is so beautiful, why are you guys doing this?
don't worry. I'll try to talk to mom and talk her out of it.
that's great.
let's not talk about it tonight.
welcome to our restaurant.
thank you.
hello. - Thank you
one vegetable salad, two seafood soup two steaks and one red wine, thank you.
happy Birthday to you...
enjoy yourself.
thank you.
why didn't you tell me earlier that it is your birthday?
I have prepared nothing.
I am already happy...
with you spending it with me.
quick, make a wish.
wait a minute, what wish did you make?
it won't come true if I said it.
but you can say the opposite of what you wish for.
let's just say...
I wish my mom will take the beach.
stop it, otherwise it will be jinx.
there is something else. - What?
nothing.
being secretive.
let's go.
No!
Tim, are you okay?
are you okay? Feeling a bit dizzy?
I am ok. You are what matters.
don't be silly. You are what matters.
Tim, are you okay?
I'm fine.
come with me.
I am warning you, stay away from my brother.
Tim, how do you even know such people?
Nat, listen to me...
that's nothing have to talk about.
look what happened to you, you could have been killed.
you just go!
stop it!
are you crazy?
she brought me here because I got hurt and you attack her?
how can you be so stupid?
she obviously just trying to take advantage of you and I know exactly what kind of little bitch...
stop it!
all of you get in the car.
and you, explain it to me when we get home.
what to explain? You guys don't listen to me anyway.
I am not going back with you.
what did you say? You say again.
I am not going with you... - OK!
Tim, please let's just go home and we'll talk about this.
I said I am not going with you.
also we are going to protect the beach.
we will win the match.
let's go.
with beach volleyball, each side has two players and there is no change of players
each set has 30 second of time out.
beach volleyball...
is very different from volleyball
for example when you receive a serve, you have to use the underarm pass.
in a situation, a player is allowed to rescue the ball...
in the opponent's side without affecting the opponent to strike.
remember you are not allowed to touch the net, because it will be counted as a net foul.
each side is allowed for three consecutive touches.
blocking also counts as one touch.
you have to rally the ball to the opponent side on the third touch.
but with beach volleyball, there are only two players.
so both two players have to do overhead pass, attack, block, dig and follow.
the demand for a player's physical strength and rapport is extremely high.
girls, remember...
Iion dance is not just a performance
it requires great demand from the performer
like volleyball, the demand for a player's rapport, the way she moves and follows is very high.
particularly when the lion is dancing on the pole.
if the steps are not coordinated...
and missed, all will fall.
moving the lion head is just like the overhand pass in volleyball
whereas the lion's tail is just like the underarm pass.
once you master these skills, it will help you tremendously in do digging
with lion dance, the head is the attack while the tail is the defence, just like passing and striking in beach volleyball.
timing is very important.
in addition to the soft and hard elements of the Bagua Transit Steps in Taichi.
and if you remember these by heart, you will be there before anyone to do the attack at the front of the net
and you will take them by surprise
hello.
there, this way.
please sit.
miss, your drink.
this is the menu.
just let me know if you need anything.
I will be there just a moment.
how can I help you?
okay, wait a minute.
how can I help you?
good morning, sir.
two man?
eat... eat seafood?
the seafood...crab. Yeah, the crab.
will Pui Long Bay restaurant here is it?
we are tourists from abroad to this place.
do you know Putonghua?
ni hao ma?
can you know what he said?
no, I don't understand.
Sawadeeka!
Ka...
Spanish.
are you know Spanish?
Ka...
hello.
welcome to our restaurant
will how many?
two.
thank you.
what did those two Sawadeeka said just now?
Spanish.
you know Spanish?
it is quite similar to French.
japanese also got a lot of Chinese characters, but I don't know any Japanese.
that's right. Why don't I learn Japanese as well?
in fact... I envy you guys.
grass is always greener on the other side.
we too would like to be a rich kid like you.
well, you don't the bitter side of things.
I really don't.
I know now is I got an extra friend, leading me down another path.
while losing a friend is like hitting another wall. Simple as that.
you are quite wordly and knowledgable.
those are fatso Walter Papa's words really.
I need to learn from him sometime.
you really don't want to go home?
I don't know, I'll see how it goes.
that's true. There is nothing you could do when you go back.
I don't care about anything.
I just care if B would win this game.
then I don't need to move.
I don't want to move back to the city.
I don't like taking MTR
turning left, turning right, so confusing.
that's right you are an indigenous people, civilization does not suit you. Go and work in the field.
look at your hair, like a poodle.
before you get to the ferry pier, and before you buy any tickets
the Agricultural and Fisheries guys will just shoot you!
sorry for being like this, I am very sorry.
don't be sorry.
this is fate.
I too want to be as optimistic like you.
I am not optimistic. I just have no clue.
never mind, tomorrow is another day.
Tim, everyone at home misses you.
I really hope to see you all at the finals.
sis?
are you okay?
still hanging on. How are you doing at the restaurant?
it's good. Nothing complicated. I can handle it.
well, I didn't break anything.
good. So next time you cook dinner and wash the dishes.
will you eat if I cook?
well see.
if you want, I can cook for you for the rest of your life.
I grew up here
everything here is very important for me
every time when I am happy or unhappy
I will come back here to look at the sea
it makes me clam.
to me the most important thing right now...
is the beach and you.
in my heart, what is important to you...
is important for me too.
hands up, Natalie
Where's your footing? Natasha
what's going on?
keep your focus and attack, Natasha
you running in the park? Come on!
pick it up!
Natalie, where is your focus?
sorry, coach.
we are running here, we need to get up to ninety today.
alright, Ladies.
that's enough. Not bad.
same time tomorrow.
mom.
mom.
how do you think we will do this time?
we will, win.
when I see you and Tim together,
I feel very happy.
finally someone is here to take care of you.
Walter is good to you too.
Walter, he do nothing the whole day.
he is not very sensitive. Always made me angry.
but after all these years with him,
I do feel he is serious about the relationship.
I think there is no escape from him now.
we have to win the match so we can live here forever, to have our roots here and generations to come.
to have our roots here?
for generations to come?
you want to get marry.
let me call Walter here right away to help you spread the generations.
can you pretend you heard nothing?
Walter...
don't tell to Walter.
let's go.
generations to come, generations,
Walter...
Walter, hurry up. The match is about to start.
coming.
I got the ball.
good.
why do you put the ball in the bag?
why not?
hold it with your hands.
you hold it then.
uncle, we're leaving. - Uncle To, we are going for my practice.
work hard!
what are you doing here?
don't you think this has gone on for long enough?
you're breaking mom's heart.
I told you I'm not going back.
please just go.
Tim, what's going on?
I can't believe that you will be pick her...
over your own family.
get him!
what are you guys doing here?
they want to mess up the place!
what's going on?
stop it, all of you!
were you hurt?
what's wrong with you?
what do you want?
Tim, Sharon, are you okay?
mom, how can you not keep your promise?
Mrs. Brewer, why did you do this?
I am sorry. This is an accident,
I have no control of it.
Tim, hurry up and call the driver and send Sharon to the hospital.
we are family, don't you trust your own mother?
go.
it's ok. Sharon, come here.
be gentle.
how are you feeling?
not as painful as before.
a little bit is okay but it was really painful just now.
sister has gone too far this time.
kid, don't think too much.
you guys are family. She is worried about you.
but mom promises us.
we knew her for a long time, she is a reliable person.
if she is so reliable, why do they bring all those people...
to mess the place up?
Mrs. Brewer is not that kind of person.
what your sister did was hurtful.
you better be careful, don't move suddenly.
the world has changed.
uncle and aunt singing the same tune.
the beach incident has got out of hand.
we are all upset by it. How could we still win the match?
you are right. No matter which kung-fu school you are with, it takes true talent to win the match.
but how can she still win now?
let her rest, she will recuperate.
but the match is the day after, is it still possible?
it's fine. I am ok.
don't worry,
I will be here for you.
you have been gone for a long while.
all of my children have grown up. Each of them is very good. Don't worry.
especially my youngest son, he is recently dating a girl which cares for him very well.
I've met her, a bit stubborn.
but I can see she is very good to Tim.
in fact they are just like us before.
I am a bit like her, stubborn and you are the only one who listen to me.
tim has your character.
looking at them now reminds me...
of the first time you hold my hand, it was down there at the beach.
Natalie, you're into over time. Totally unacceptable.
never mind. It doesn't matter.
we still a win.
well done. We are into the final.
into the final!
let's celebrate!
what? It's Final, how?
let's go eat. - Yes.
let's celebrate. - Yes.
you pay? - No!
shaking your heads, you...
let's go eat!
waitress. - Yes.
do you still have milk on toast?
all sold out.
okay...
thank you. - Enjoy your time.
you go first.
it took a lot of hard work to enter the final.
so I have booked the restaurant on the Peak to celebrate.
their milk on toast is the best.
I was just about to ask you.
this restaurant group has two restaurants in Causeway Bay, their toast is also very good. Why do we need to go all the way to the Peak then?
dad.
what are you trying to say?
nothing.
still at it?
ignore him. Let's eat, come on.
Walter, we can't just have milk on toast, where is the main course?
Yes, you enjoy your food.
I will go get the main dish.
here it comes the main dish.
so many flowers.
Walter, how do you know it is your mother's birthday?
stop kidding dad.
B, open it and see what's inside.
is it for me?
there is nothing in there!
isn't it beautiful? - So beautiful!
you like it?
where did you pick them?
where did he steal them?
what! I used all of my savings to buy these flowers for you.
of all these years I know you, you never send me flowers.
do you like it?
B, pick the flower in the middle, see what's inside.
Yes! Hurry up, hurry up.
where is it?
where is it?
dad, where is the thing I asked you to put inside last night?
I asked you to put something in there last night
is it this you are looking for?
give it back to me. It is for my daughter-in-law.
be good, I will buy you a bigger one tomorrow.
B, will you marry me.
say yes...
Oh, I don't know!
don't know? You said you want to spread the generations.
so it is you!
I help you spread the news. Say yes to him.
please will you marry me?
I don't know.
you don't know, go ask uncle.
say yes to him.
marry him.
they all say the same thing. Quickly say yes to him.
B, please marry me.
I don't know.
that's right.
great! Done!
fantastic! Now I have a daughter-in-law.
after this big meal and when we get back home, I will buy you a big diamond ring.
I want a really big one.
I am so happy!
wait a minute. There are only a few days left before the final match. Don't stay too late.
I have some great tricks to teach you.
great tricks?
that's right.
at the moment, there isn't any chance to beat those two sisters.
but we still got time for me to show you two, hope you'll find them useful when times comes.
Walter, did you finish what you aunt asked you to?
done.
smart boy.
why are you two acting so strangely?
you will know tomorrow.
B, let's do something romantic.
go on...
b
are you very happy?
Yes, I am.
dad said next year is an auspicious year.
he offers to pay 30 tables at our wedding banquet.
so let's get married, organized a wedding banquet and have babies!
that will be so happy!
have babies? Quite a good idea.
do you want a boy or girl?
well, it doesn't really matter.
what's important is not to look like you but me.
b - Yes?
in fact I have something I want to talk to you for a long time.
as soon as you agreed to go out with me,
I've already made up my mind to marry you and made you my wife.
I have nothing much to offer, but you still chose me.
silly pig, do you know why I want to be with you?
because you are true to me.
good! Wait till you got the champion and we will organise the wedding banquet.
B, we will win!
everything is done, auntie.
where are the girls?
down there.
what are all these things for? Are they going to mend the sharks' net?
this is what the old man is best at.
the key to winning the match relies on this.
girl, looking at the situation, the only way to win the sisters...
is to hit them right on in the attack.
this training...
might be physically exhausting, but I think it is the best method.
there is only sand and water in the sea.
to release the strongest power in an instant, each muscle's ability to move and turn is key.
use the control of breathing along with the strength in the waist, and the steps that uncle taught you before.
as long as your body is in coordination, the power of your shoulders pushing the arm strongly forward.
focus the attack on the strings and practice repeatedly, you won't lose your strength too much.
the attack in front of the net allows you to gain the upper hand.
this is the key in winning the match.
this is your uncle's secret trick.
then we will win.
German, start time.
what for?
typically, it takes about 0. 5 tonnes of force...
to knock down fighters of this caliber.
these ladies have 60 seconds.
got it.
sixty seconds.
Natasha, thirty two.
Natalie, thirty one.
at this rate, their opponents don't stand a chance.
awesome, come take a look.
listen, don't waste a time, ok?
Yes, sir
how is your injury?
I am ok, no problem.
wear this.
but you wear this ring all the time.
this rings means a lot to me.
when you wear it, it is like me being with you in the court.
three against two, we will win for sure.
keep going!
hello everyone! Welcome all of you here.
hong Kong Open Beach Volleyball Competition.
I am your commentator, Bob.
firstly, let me introduce you to the two teams who've entered the final.
over this side with two beautiful ladies in pastel tops and bottoms are the Pui Long Bay team.
on the other team the players...
Iook a bit like Westerns wearing black is the Magic Wings.
why are they called the Magic Wings?
I will tell you all about it after the match starts.
good to see you ladies at the tournament today.
same here.
you know you changed my mind what I thought about you, but we will still a win.
well, let's play and find out.
how is your injury?
no problem at all. Come on!
the coin already tossed and the team has picked their sides.
what we have all been waiting, the Hong Kong Open Beach Volleyball finals now officially begins!
first off, the team that starts the game is the confident, Magic Wings.
Sharon, it's ok.
Yes!
it is just one point.
it is so tough, so hard to gain the first point.
the game has just started. Be patience.
I am very sorry, although I was paid to comment,
Iook at it. How can I, right?
magic Wings first score one point.
good ball!
keep it up!
why are they called the Magic Wings?
look at the way they jumped, the time they are up in the air are at least a minute longer than any other players.
it is as if they have wings on the backs.
don't underestimate that one second, it is enough for them to change the direction of their spike.
it is like a vulture locking their eyes on their prey.
there are only two chances...
to win these gifted players, one is a very slim chance and the other way is no chances at all!
listen, ladies. I wish you keep the pressure on.
I don't want this to go past the second round.
finish them quick.
remember to attack in all aspects.
play quick, exhausted them. We can win this!
girls, get back the second set.
we can't lose.
Natalie, look at me.
no pain. Get up.
they seem so much faster than they used to be.
Yeah, lets drive them back, divide and conquer.
let's do it.
it is really hard to tell now.
both teams are up to par.
look at Pui Long team, their attack is so much faster.
they are much stronger in second round.
although this is exhausting for them, there is no going back.
what matters is to win one round.
keep going!
are you serious?
do you like this game that much?
now you get to play another round. Congratulations!
not looking good!
this is the first time Magic Wings lost a round.
they finally meet their match.
how can you give up the competition?
you have let them a chance to catch up.
Natalie, you know who the weakest one is.
remember, you must attack her weakness.
pui Long Team is not going to Iet Magic Wings win the match.
they are playing harder and harder.
will they smash the Magic Wings unbeatable title?
Sharon! Are you okay?
Sharon, are you okay?
keep going!
are you okay?
that is not fair.
it will get more painful if you continue to play.
I am fine.
understood. Don't insist to play on.
the game hasn't ended, stay calm.
let her decide on her own whether she wants to continue or not.
let's forget about it. We don't have to play on.
I don't want you to get hurt.
if we don't continue we will lose. We cannot lose.
we said we cannot lose last night.
I promise you, we will finish this round.
we only need two points.
hang on!
it's impossible! How can we lose?
or... could this really be Dad's will?
Hey, Mom! So we're going to play on the beach, okay?
OK. Let's go.
Mrs. Brewer, we have been here for decades, should we...
let's go for a honeymoon?
come on!
don't be silly!
mom, I really love this place.
Hello, Mrs. Brewer!
look the baby can talk.
be quiet! You are waking up the baby.
sorry.
Mrs. Brewer, I got a date now.
still looking at girls! Knee down and say sorry!
I've eaten too much. I ate three boxes and this is the fourth.
eat some mango.
mom!
we go down and have fun.
the Beaufort Castle, a twelfth-century Crusader fort, has passed from hand to hand, from army to army, for hundreds of years.
bloody battles have turned it into a mythological symbol of bravery.
in 1982, on the first day of the Lebanon War, the Israeli flag was raised on the mountain at the end of a fierce and controversial battle.
eighteen years later, in the wake of public protest, the Israeli government decided to leave Lebanon.
incoming, incoming.
impact, impact.
get in, it's not over yet.
did you come to save us?
I'm Oshri. The company sergeant.
this is Liraz, the outpost commander. Welcome to Beaufort.
Ziv Faran. Bomb Squad. - Nice to meet you.
is it like this all the time? - It was quiet until you arrived.
impact. Impact.
see that doorway, over there? That's the entrance to the protected area.
sprint to it and don't stop for anything.
even if you hear, "Incoming, incoming," keep running.
got it? Let's go. Get up.
go. Run.
got stuck?
want to wait a moment?
no, it's okay. Let's go.
incoming, incoming.
impact, impact.
Bardelas Leader, what a guest!
meet Ziv from the Bomb Squad.
he'll hang around here for a few days, to open the road for us.
Pavel, Robbie.
Pavel, go to the J-curve.
right. J-curve.
have a seat.
that's the road... - Can you see the device?
not really.
it's around here. Well hidden.
bomb camouflage. They got that from us. It's IDF. - May I?
Yeah, sure.
they put them there under our noses. Ballsy bastards.
I don't know what blew up on you, but this looks hot to me.
impossible.
I was there. There was an explosion, I saw it with my own eyes.
could they have come back and reset the device?
no. Impossible.
Robbie and Pavel have been observing it since the event.
we have tapes.
anything's possible.
we're ineffective in fog. We had a few hours with no visibility.
wait, what's the problem? I don't get it.
the device has looked like this for two weeks.
your people have seen all the pictures.
you drove us nuts in debriefing. There's nothing new here.
look, no one has actually seen it.
we know nothing about the parameter.
chances are there's more than one device. It's really dangerous.
is that what they sent you for?
to tell us it's dangerous? I know it's dangerous.
believe me, I know.
I want to talk to my commander.
I think we should cancel the operation.
what do you mean, cancel?
we can't stay here with a blocked road.
we waited a month for you only to hear that it's dangerous?
look, I'm sorry I have to disappoint you.
I know you guys want to go home.
but... Kabarnit Procedure isn't appropriate here.
I'm not doing it.
what do you mean, you're not doing it?
where did that come from?
it's dangerous.
it's not a game. - Listen, Ziv.
you want to talk to your commanding officer, fine.
check with him, consult, that's cool.
but "I'm not doing it?
where did that come from?
who's asking you?
Liraz...
if you don't do it, they won't cancel it.
they'll just bring in someone else to do it in your place.
do you have a red phone here?
talk to whoever you want.
they know everything you do, and they sent you here anyway.
can I have a moment alone?
come on.
why don't they just send in a D9 armored bulldozer?
seriously. Why send in a man on foot?
they want to investigate the device, not blow it up.
it's rare, to find a whole device.
even so, it seems totally crazy to me.
that's his job, Oshri.
disposing of bombs. What do you want?
they'll send him back home. Wanna bet?
no way. - I'm telling you.
okay. We're on.
cigarette?
I don't smoke.
want to start?
Ziv.
Ziv. You awake?
come on, let's go up to the observation post.
okay, give me a minute.
ziv, this is how you sleep at Beaufort.
I'll wait for you up top.
no, thanks.
don't let him get to you.
what was your name again?
Koris.
what's he like? Do you guys like him?
does it matter?
you're right. Doesrt matter...
Liraz is exactly what the army needs here now.
someone who can't believe they actually gave him the job.
who's there? - Ziv, bomb squad.
Ziv the bomb squad.
come here, let's have a look at you.
have you seen Liraz? I'm looking for him.
Liraz? Not here.
are you lost?
where am I? - Far away.
as far as you can get. If you're here, it's by mistake.
are you alone on watch here?
Shpitz, Ziv the bomb squad wants to know if I'm here alone.
what's up, Ziv the bomb squad? - Have you seen Liraz?
why do you want Liraz? What for?
stay with us. We'll make you a deluxe Beaufort toast.
make you one? Pesto, cherry tomatoes, Dijon mustard.
you like? - No, thanks. He's waiting for me.
good, because we're fresh out of pesto and cherry tomatoes.
and mustard.
say, bomb squad, do they really teach you to dismantle bombs?
how did you get to that unit, anyway? Did you get there by mistake, or did you want to go there?
mostly by mistake, but I'm not sorry.
you? Are you here by mistake, or did you want to be here?
I wanted to be here. That's the mistake!
get it?
and what's it like? Interesting?
what do you do here all day? - Guard the mountain.
so it doesn't escape.
have a nice shift.
excuse me, have you seen Liraz?
soldier. Soldier...?
soldier...
what happened, buddy?
what's that thing there? There's a dummy there.
Yeah, reinforcements.
"Spooks." There are six of them dispersed over the guard posts, to attract fire.
are you serious?
what happened? Did you talk to it?
that's good.
it means they're doing their job, no?
okay, let's go up, I'll show you the road.
a bit to the right...
Arnoon. The device exploded exactly in the middle.
on the curve.
can you see it?
sorry about earlier, at the observation post.
I shouldn't have yelled at you like that.
it's okay.
what did your commander tell you when you spoke to him?
that it has to be done. There's no alternative.
and that I should be careful.
look, I wasn't trying to get out of the job, earlier.
I spent a year at Hq, waiting for this.
Yeah, but come the moment of truth, your balls start shaking.
that's the way it is. No way around it.
my balls aren't shaking.
I said what I did because it's really dangerous.
what exactly are you going to do there?
we go together to the evaluation point,
I observe the device and then go in, with a medic behind me.
I make sure there's no trip wire or device that could explode, and if not, I go to the device, dismantle it and take it with me.
did they drill you on this?
dozens of times.
and what if the device explodes?
it's not supposed to.
tell me, do your parents know you're here?
of course not.
what for?
they know I'm on the northern border, but not inside Lebanon.
my mother hasn't known where I am since I was nine.
afraid to ask.
and you?
if my dad knew I was here, he'd come and take me out by force.
I'm serious. He wouldn't let me out of the house.
so you guys are serious lefties, then?
did you know they didn't even need to take this mountain?
had they waited until morning, the terrorists would have run.
they could've come up without battle or casualties.
you could say that about any battle.
the fact is that the troops fought here like men.
they even issued an order not to conquer, not to come up here.
Oh yeah? So why did they?
no one knows to this day. Somehow the order disappeared into thin air.
impossible.
my uncle was killed here in '82. My mother's brother.
what, in the conquest battle?
from what I gather, fifty meters from where we stand now.
caught a bullet as he entered the fort.
so what are you doing here? Are you insane?
if I was your father, I wouldn't let you out of the house either.
I'd tie you to the refrigerator, or something.
I've been hearing stories about this mountain my entire life.
I had to see it.
to be able to say I was here, before we leave Lebanon.
you should have told me. I'd have sent you pictures.
relax, we're not leaving so soon.
I bet your kids will still be here.
maybe, as tourists. - Maybe.
what is it? - Liquorice.
my mother brings it from Holland.
it's salty. A little strong.
Bardelas from Leader.
Roger, over, Leader.
copy stand down. - Copy that.
stand down. Good morning. - Good morning.
panther, Bardelas, move to Tomato.
Roger. Tomato.
Ziv.
identify it?
send in the dog.
Nadav.
Thanks.
okay, I'm going in. Send me Koris.
I'm going in with you, not Koris.
no way. That's not what we agreed.
I don't care. I've decided that I'm going in with you.
that's not procedure. - That's the way it's going to be.
it's a shame we're standing here, exposed.
if you have a problem, you can go back to the outpost.
keep your distance, kid.
go on, boy.
come out my Beloved, the Bride to meet;
the inner light of Shabbat, let us greet.
to welcome the Shabbat, let us progress, for it is the source from which to bless.
from the beginning, chosen before time, last in deed, but in thought - prime.
come out my Beloved, the Bride to meet...
you know, they told us to start getting rid of equipment.
when the convoy arrives tonight, anything unnecessary, goes.
bit by bit.
until the evacuation.
no one gets rid of anything.
not even a water boiler. Not without my authorization. Got it?
I'm telling you what they told us.
anything that's not vital, goes.
what's not vital?
show me one thing that isn't vital here.
the television, for instance.
why isn't it vital?
Why? Are you being punished? Don't you deserve to watch TV?
there's no such thing as not vital. Everything's vital.
if one thing's not vital here, then everything's not vital.
I don't understand.
you don't have to understand.
you're early. You have nine more minutes.
I saved you the drag of the nine last minutes.
there's food. Go eat.
a feast. The cook outdid himself.
idiots. Who prepares a meal at midnight?
we also have permission to shower.
well, did you?
I'm on the ready team. I'll shower tomorrow morning.
also, they brought new sleeping bags.
brand new, from the factory.
I put one on your bunk.
what's up, Koris? Everything okay?
great. Perfect.
I'm not touching their food, their sleeping bags or their water!
it's like dancing on the blood.
next time they should leave the road closed. Shouldn't send anything.
it's killing me. A man died here.
he came, said "Hi," and died.
and what for?
to open a shitty road that only we use.
for a year I've been keeping my batteries upside-down.
like an idiot. So I don't waste them.
turn them back only before operational activity.
fuck them now.
stop it.
what, night alert procedure?
think they can't see this post?
think they don't know you're here?
bullshit. On the contrary. You're here so they can see you.
what are we here for?
so that they know we haven't run away yet.
stop it, Koris. This isn't a game.
what's this, Pavel? Why is this on the truck?
I told you, that's the order.
really, I didn't make this up.
take it off. Forget the order. Are you nuts?
what do you mean?
where are you going?
they told me to leave. No more clearing roads on foot. - Said who?
command.
okay. Take it off. I don't care what they told you.
get him down.
what are you doing?
the dog isn't leaving. Understand?
I don't care what they told you. File a complaint. He's not leaving!
what's it to you? Who are you? My orders are to leave and no one sent a replacement for me. The dog doesn't stay without me.
you're not my commander. You can't make me stay.
does it make sense to evacuate a dog, but leave soldiers?
this dog stays here. Understand?
stop it, Liraz. Stop it.
move. - It's not Nadav's fault.
he hasn't been home in a month, and has no replacement.
there's no more road clearing on foot.
so why keep him here?
what for? This is it. It's over. Done.
we're holding up the convoy.
in a minute there'll be missiles.
I don't care what they told you. The dog stays, understand?
he's like a weapon. I can't abandon him. No way.
so tell Command it was my order.
now get your stuff.
get on the truck and fuck off.
fuck off. Go.
get out of here. I don't want to see your face.
get out of my sight.
you don't deserve to be here.
crazy bastard.
go.
go on, back to the protected area.
incoming, incoming.
impact, impact.
incoming, incoming.
impact. Impact.
wait, buddy. Give it a few more seconds.
incoming, incoming.
how many days do you have left here?
eighteen. Including today.
okay, listen. Why should you dry out here for 18 more days?
next convoy, go back to Israel. You've done your share.
where did that come from?
if you have something to say, Liraz, say it.
I have nothing to say. You've done your bit, man.
get out.
go say goodbye to the kids before you leave.
give them a tour at the fortress.
you sure? - Yeah. Sure.
come with me? We'll bring them some goodies.
let the kids run loose a little bit.
like Kalimi did to us on our first tour of duty here.
impact. Impact. - You go.
at this point I don't belong there.
but you go. It's important.
hold on a minute.
put down the camera, Shpitz. Photograph the landscape.
not the people. We don't want to be in tomorrow's newspaper.
Wow. This was their bunker.
and this, their guard post.
soldiers have been on this damn mountain for a thousand years.
but no mortar shells fall here, right?
never. The fortress is sacred.
the Hezbollah respect the Crusaders.
it's so quiet here.
who's Michael? - What?
Michael. Is there something you want to tell us?
Michelle. Michelle, asshole.
my girlfriend.
lives in New Jersey.
I'm on a plane a day after I'm out of the army, land on her doorstep twelve hours later.
are you sure that's how you spell Michelle?
don't mess with my head. I'm sure, I checked a million times.
one more word and I'll have you studying English all night.
if you checked, it's cool.
Doesrt matter. She'll leave you after a week anyway.
you're not cut out for an American.
watch it, Kundalini!
besides, her dad's Israeli.
even worse.
say, what about Liraz?
does he have a girlfriend?
Lilach. Six years together.
you seen her?
do you guys hang out together? - Sometimes. Not much.
what's he like?
not much of a dancer.
I can't see him dancing, with his M16...
what, are you making fun of him?
I just can't imagine him being romantic. Dunno. I just can't.
truth is, he's not all that big on romance.
how could he be romantic?
last year I saw him on the street, in Tiberias, in jeans, with his gun slung around his shoulder.
what kind of jerk carries his weapon on leave?
did he see you? Did you say hi?
he pretended not to see me. Crossed the street.
what did you expect? For him to stop and give you a hug? - No.
but he could have nodded.
he knows me, after all.
at the outpost he doesn't say hi, either.
why does he keep such a distance from us, anyway?
what's the deal? Are you guys short of friends?
leave him alone.
what kind of a soldier was he?
devoted. A real workhorse.
from Day One he knew he wanted to be an officer.
took the test three times, but was rejected.
they wouldn't let him in.
said he wasrt officer material.
so he drove the battalion commander crazy.
sat outside his office every day, begged him for a chance.
in the end they let him take the course.
he graduated with the top marks. They couldn't figure him out.
was he liked in your company?
sure. King of the world.
the soldiers, mind you, not the commanders.
why, don't you like him?
sure. He's a good officer.
you can tell he cares.
you're lucky they didn't stick you with some faggot officer.
if something happens here, you know you can count on him.
they didn't send him here for nothing.
I'm here just because of him. If he weren't here,
I could have finished my service easy.
every night out in Nahariya.
everyone knows that if something serious happens here, he's the only one who'll know how to function.
like he functioned with Ziv?
stop the bullshit, Koris. What could he have done?
the guy died for nothing. I swear.
and the next day, suddenly they cancel Kabarnit Procedure.
two days later they bring in the D9, plow over the road.
so what did he die for? I still don't get it.
am I the only one who thinks it's weird?
a good officer, who can function, wouldn't let that happen.
Koris, he takes orders just like you, okay?
he doesn't decide when to send in the D9.
think he makes those decisions?
and why aren't we allowed to talk about the evacuation?
as if we were 3-year-olds? - What do you want him to say?
4 old whores who don't know shit about the army are brainwashing the whole country with their bullshit.
what's it got to do with you?
what do you want him to say? - I want him to stand up like a man and tell us that Hezbollah will be here in two weeks.
and that all the IDF is doing now is for nothing. That's what.
okay, forget politics.
no, it pisses me off!
someone died here. How can you say it was for nothing?
you know what? Not for nothing. You got your chow, okay?
Koris, I'll throw my helmet in your face. - Okay, enough!
suddenly the landscape seems different.
I don't know why.
it's a well-known phenomenon.
when you're here long enough, the view changes.
suddenly you see new things.
it's just a new angle.
no, something changes in your head, believe me.
you end up missing this place.
so when are you running away from here?
I'm not running away. Don't say that.
my time has come. - You're right. That's cool. Sorry.
when are you getting out of here?
in two days.
come here, give me a hug.
come on, don't be afraid.
you come to me.
when you're in New Jersey, every night, before you fuck Michelle, think about us here for one minute.
picture this moment.
swear you won't go a day without thinking of us.
one minute. That's enough.
cool. It's a deal.
take care. - Okay.
sure? - Sure.
what?
good luck. - Thanks.
hang in there.
want me to cry? Come on.
get your gear. Let's get the hell out of here.
Noah! - What?
in the ark gather the forest animals...
in 21 days I'll kiss Michelle on the lips, do you believe it?
are you with me, Honey?
ever hear of Kundalini meditation?
it's a kind of snake that lies coiled in your pelvis.
and you have to awaken it from its dormant state.
if it awakens inside, it can actually bring salvation.
and it calms your soul, mends the broken pieces in your heart. True spiritual life.
want me to demonstrate, Honey?
Kundalini, stage one; stand with bent knees and shake your body.
shake it, shake it.
relax, from the earth to the sky.
I'm afraid, Master Shakura. I can't relax.
have no fear, I'm with you. We're together.
let it out of you, naturally, freely.
don't lead, let yourself be led, carried away. Yes, shake hard. Shake hard.
now, shake hard, shake deep...
impact. Impact.
missile at Green Post. Missile at Green.
Zitlawi!
get an extinguisher.
and get the ready team with a doctor.
Koris, get the ready team.
come on, snap out of it!
lmpact, impact.
Zitlawi! Zitlawi!
incoming, incoming.
impact. Impact.
tell them we have an injury or a casualty.
Where's the ready team, why aren't they here?
Where's the doctor, fuck it?!
Caesar from Bardelas medic.
we have an injury here. Copy?
we got hit by a missile.
Liraz, here's the extinguisher. Clear, clear!
go in with you? - Wait outside.
oshri, get me Caesar.
Caesar from Bardelas Leader.
incoming, incoming.
Caesar from Bardelas Leader, we have an injury, copy?
a serious injury. I need a helo ASAP.
do you copy? Over.
Zitlawi, can you hear me?
what's the status?
Helo. Get a helo. Don't tell me to calm down.
motherfucker. - Got to get him onto a stretcher. Get him down.
support his head.
get him up. Get him up.
impact, impact.
support his head, Liraz.
Zitlawi, can you hear me?
be strong, kid. I love you, man.
take over for me on the stretcher.
I'm on duty here until the ready team arrives.
stay here.
keep your eyes peeled. It could be a combined attack.
Where's the ready team? Fuck.
must be waiting for the shelling to stop.
go with Zitlawi. Go.
how did you die? - I have no idea.
all night, I watched Danny and Bridget swoon over each other.
who is Bridget?
my best friend, who I now realize is a brutal whore.
Bishop wants us to go after more people of influence.
the hospital is off-limits for recruiting.
I wanna take you out.
you talk me again, it's your ass.
you know, you suck at being a werewolf.
what do you mean? - I'm a werewolf too.
ray's a pretty decent guy.
he's got nowhere to stay. Maybe he could crash here.
we hardly know him. - What you gonna do?
rip me to shreds in this kitchen and prove to your friend, Josh, what a murderous scum we both know you to be?
there are vampires in there?
tear him apart!
every culture has its own way of saying goodbye.
comfort's in the rituals that prepare the living for death.
they ease the journey into what comes after...
...Assuming there is an after.
but in the end, death is a journey you take alone.
for some of us, that journey takes us on a hidden path through a darker forest, where instead of answers, we only find a whole new set of questions.
this is the carotid artery.
there's one on each side of the neck.
I'm ready! - Shut up and listen!
you're here to clean.
and it's like tapping straight into a geyser.
you can decide later if you're a lefty or a righty.
that's right.
the first gush is the freshest, the sweetest, isn't it?
now, it is customary to share your first kill.
I feel like I am in a submarine that is about to blow!
you have to stop.
this isn't me.
ever since you got back from talking to Danny and Bridget, it has been Amityville horror plumbing.
you are poltergeist-ing your own house.
I said goodbye. I made my peace.
I gave them my blessing. - Then why does it...
why does it sound like the house is gonna eat us?
I don't know. I...
I just... I'm really...
I'm not trying to do anything.
OK, well, so there's just nothing that you're upset about?
nothing? - Mm-mmm.
I don't know how to make it stop.
that might be me.
I just flooded the toilet.
I think that the fact that we are drowning in sewage is a sign you should be moving on.
you've been here for a month.
Yeah, I've got so much joy in me, not even your cadaverous mug can ruin it.
I'm starving after last night.
there's nothing like a little late-night exercise to get the appetite going.
I'm sure I don't wanna know what you're talking about.
there he is.
sleeping it off?
what happened there?
Oh, that was just some...
drunk idiots... Being idiots.
they were baked, all bloated up.
the city is hell, man.
that's why I like the country, the woods, nature...
but those degenerates, they picked the wrong night to walk on...
and this boy, with the puppy eyes, he's a killer.
it's the shy ones you gotta watch out for.
the sink's, uh...
I know. Call a plumber.
I'll call Danny. Um, do you want a ride tonight?
you're off the hook. Me and Josh are turning together.
Really?
Hey, Ray...
you sure about that?
we're gonna meet at the shed after sunset, right?
I just hope it's not too much of a letdown after stomping the crap out of them fangers last night.
I just... I have to go mail something, so...
we're gonna run together, all right?
unleashed!
help us hold him!
what's his story? - Dahmer out there attacked him.
he was ripping out this guy's neck with his teeth.
poor guy stabbed him, but he's so tweaked on pcp or something, he...
I need the priest! The priest!
now he finds religion. Convenient.
Mr. Sarin... Mr. Sarin, do you remember me?
I'm Aidan. - You're the nurse.
Yes, and I thought we said goodbye yesterday.
I screwed up. I screwed up!
I need help over here!
you know what? I got this.
I can't hear your heart.
who did this to you? Who turned you?
you're one of us? Help me!
I didn't see the knife.
the cops were on me... - Shut up!
why were you asking for the priest? Did he do this?
get me out! - How many did he turn?
help me! - Sedative!
get him!
stop him! - Get out of the way!
I poured in that drain-clog stuff.
the whole sink started bubbling over.
that's pure acid. It'll eat through the pipes.
well, I didn't know what else to do.
all the sinks, the toilet, every drain's backed up.
don't you have one of those snake things, or whatever you call them?
this is where Sally fell.
Yep. Fell so hard, I broke the floor.
I don't know, Danny.
maybe it's time to change out those tiles.
I know this must be hard for you.
I'm glad you're here.
it makes it easier.
Hey, you're a raging capitalist landlord now.
you gotta take care of the place, right?
think you can squeeze in?
Mary, can we get an iv?
could Mr. Sarin find you?
how long have you been here?
transferred from Summerville a couple of days ago.
I gotta say, I miss the bustle of a parish.
so you're a real priest?
ordained 10 years ago.
holy orders and everything.
but prayers, communion...
how do you give mass?
nothing's changed for me.
I'm still saving souls, just in a different way.
six years ago, I was dying of cancer, lymphoma.
I was 34.
in the hospital, as I looked into that...
abyss, I suddenly knew.
I knew there was no afterlife.
God spoke to me like he never had before.
not in words, but in a true and sudden revelation.
this life is all we get.
it was so clear.
and that wasn't enough for you?
of course not! I was 34. I wanted to live.
a doctor, a very smart and sympathetic woman, pitied me and offered me another option.
don't you see?
God saved me.
I asked him. I begged him to save me.
and he did.
so you think that God wanted you to become a vampire?
well, if God made everything, then he made vampires too.
Jesus himself rose from the dead.
Oh, are you saying that Jesus was a...
gets you thinking, doesn't it?
look, I don't care what your perverted theology is, there is no turning in this hospital.
well, unfortunately, you don't get to make that call.
what does that mean?
Bishop's the one who brought me here.
so it's gonna be a scary year, but it's gonna be ok.
what are you doing with Mrs. Maida?
excuse me?
don't bother my patients. She just had...
hip surgery. Yeah, I know.
she needs to rest.
I'm pretty sure that chatting with her about her son is not going to endanger her hip.
her son? - Her son.
the youngest, Sunil, he's in Costa Rica for a year and she's convinced that he's gonna be macheted to death by maoist rebels.
I assured her that Costa Rica's a democracy.
it's peaceful.
and it's very economically developed for the region.
fascinating, you listen to npr.
since when are you and Mrs. Maida so tight?
Oh, I was taking her down to radiology the other day, and she mentioned that she never gets any visitors.
so I said that I would visit her.
is that all right with you?
it beats mopping up vomit and changing urine-scented sheets, right?
Yeah, well, it would...
except it's my day off.
will you stop it?
Sally's not here.
I feel like I could make contact.
you remember when she spoke to me?
Oh, for God's sake, she didn't speak to you!
she did. Well, I... I felt her.
do you even think about how this makes me feel?
you constantly bringing her up?
I'm sorry.
it's just...
if you were there, you would...
I snaked all the drains.
all I found was a hair clog in the shower.
so that was it?
that would cause the drains to be a little slow...
sorry, Bridg.
...but it wouldn't cause a whole system backup.
I don't think it's this either.
a rock like that can't back up anything.
it's Sally's ring.
dammit!
Hey, I thought we were watching a movie.
I lost my engagement ring.
it fell.
what? - It was right here.
I was washing my hands and it just slipped down the drain.
and I could see it.
I tried to reach in and I pushed it down further.
why'd you take it off?
it's a little loose and I was afraid it would slip off with the soap.
Oh, so you just leave it on the sink.
you never told me it was loose.
I thought... Danny, come on.
we'll take the sink apart. - Why bother?
what do mean, "why bother?
the ring obviously doesn't mean anything to you, if it's even in there.
OK, look, it was stupid.
OK? I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have left it on the sink.
I feel like a real idiot here.
when else do you take it off?
when you go out with the girls? - Of course not.
maybe you left it in some guy's bed!
how the hell am I supposed to know?
Oh, I know what this is about.
it was too crappy for you. - You know I love that ring!
then where the hell is it!
I told you, it fell!
what was the ring doing in the pipes?
how am I supposed to know?
maybe the house was trying to tell you something.
the house wanted you to have the ring.
look, Sally was always losing it, all right?
she could never keep it on.
the house was trying to tell me how I died.
I told you no recruiting at the hospital.
well, you don't tell me anything.
Oh, you had to have Sarin, right?
because he is just so... what?
what? What is he exactly?
do you know that he died completely friendless?
childless, estranged from his parents.
lucky for him, he was exquisitely provided for by the family estate.
pharmaceuticals, apparently.
OK, so you turned him for the money.
Ooh, that is so noble.
when you call for a cleanup, who do you think pays for that?
the manpower, the body bags, the bribes to make people turn the other way.
we are vampires, you realize, and not magicians.
and turning a priest, that's what? Just for laughs?
well, nobody sells eternal life like a priest.
since when do you need to sell it?
anytime that you want someone, you just take him...
or her.
that's right. You missed the meeting.
I'm only turning the willing now.
the influential, the useful, people like Sarin and father gates.
you remember when Lincoln used the archbishop to sell the union cause?
I was too busy fighting a war to read the papers.
Yes, you were very young.
well, uh, it turns out, all the great monarchs have always had holy men by their sides to consecrate wars...
boost their egos.
...Win over the masses, from Charles I to, hell, George W.
everyone's used religion.
used it for what?
you remember how we used to say that being a vampire was almost perfect?
but the lying, the hiding, the stifling day job to cover our tracks is exhausting and tedious.
when we have the numbers and we have the power, we won't have to hide.
we can live right out in the open.
you're not serious.
I'm sure you've thought about it.
how many times have you drilled it into me?
keep a low profile, blend in, be invisible.
cause we had to.
soon we won't.
what happened to you, bishop?
you're asking me?
I can barely stand to look at you, starving and weak.
I can't tell if you're delusional...
now, I have been very patient and understanding and even helpful during your little experiment, but it is time to wake up, Aidan.
we live forever, humans don't.
do the math.
it's evolution.
it's nature taking its course.
Yeah, there's nothing natural about us.
you're so confused, Aidan.
you don't even know what you are.
you're a vampire playing a human while shacking up with an animal.
and a rabid one at that.
of course... hmm...
how could he tell you?
tell me what?
your wolf has a taste for vampires.
muzzle your dog, Aidan, or we will.
glad you decided to come.
ready? Huh?
the house, the pipes, it was me.
I was trying to tell myself all along.
what do you mean?
it turns out, I didn't just die.
Danny killed me.
Oh, your face!
it was an accident. What happened?
you'd never guess it by looking at him.
he's so sweet-looking, but...
Danny has a temper.
I never let myself see it.
he's passionate. " That's what I told myself.
he's crazy in love with me and that's why he's so jealous.
Sally, I am so, so sorry.
we had a fight.
he was in a rage and he shoved me.
and I fell down the stairs.
all these times that he has been here, going on about you.
he just stood there.
he looked at the evidence and walked away.
he blamed it on me!
where are you going? - I'll be back.
No! Don't!
he's not getting away with this.
please!
please.
what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
can you feel it coming?
I enjoy this.
I wish I could close my eyes, wake up, and it'd be morning.
this is just the beginning.
you and me.
tomorrow we start.
we'll find more of us.
with your bulbous brain, it'll be easy.
why would we do that?
a pack, Josh! Think about it.
a whole team of us running together, living together, like nature intended.
nature? You think this is natural?
it'll be incredible!
nothing to hide from each other, nothing to fear.
vampires couldn't touch us.
Yeah, but a pack would only make us more dangerous.
Exactly! Invincible!
safe.
what we did last night to those vampires, we... we never would have done that alone.
they're murdering leeches, Josh.
I don't care!
I lost control. I gave in to the wolf!
your wolf!
I never want to do that again.
all right.
maybe I pushed you too far.
we can take it slower.
I don't wanna take it slower.
I was gonna tell you this tomorrow, after the Moon...
but I think it's time you headed out.
you're joking.
no.
thank you.
I'm grateful for everything that you've taught me, but...
I can manage.
you can't even say "transform
without looking like you're gonna puke.
you keep on talking about the wolf like it's some kind of monster in a fairy tale, like it's not you!
it isn't me!
it's an infection, a disease!
you don't have to suffer!
you don't have to be alone, none of us do.
I...
I think maybe changing together isn't such a good idea.
what? Now you're gonna sulk?
you take the shed. I'll find another place.
I won't abandon you while you're living with that bloodmonger.
come on, Josh! It's not safe.
no, we don't! You make it worse for me.
you make everything worse for me.
you don't understand.
I've been looking for you for 2 years!
two years?
I wanted to tell you earlier.
I'm the one you met on that camping trip.
I'm the one who turned you.
I'm the one who gave you this gift.
you can't be.
I was roaming the forest in Maine.
I attacked 2 backpackers.
one of them died.
and one was wounded, a scratch on the shoulder.
I checked the paper for days after.
I found your name.
you killed my friend!
but you survived. You're the only one, Josh.
I've been trying to find you.
I've been tracking you ever since.
Why? Why?
why wouldn't you just leave me alone?
I couldn't.
every time I closed my eyes, I saw you lying there in the woods.
I couldn't stop thinking.
I had to see what was your life like.
my life?
my life!
I don't... I don't have a life!
my family, my fiancée, my whole future...
you should've... You should've killed me.
no, don't say that.
why didn't you?
there were voices, screaming, men coming.
you know how it is, just flashes of memory.
the wolf is a gift, Josh.
I was just like you at first.
this is not a gift!
it's a curse!
feel it! Feel it!
we're faster and stronger than any human.
I don't wanna be this!
we're more alive, Josh!
we're the best of human and animal.
all this time.
all this time, you've been coaching me, pretending to help me manage my condition.
and you're the one who did this to me!
what kind of sick freak are you?
I'm your friend.
what do you want from me?
what do you want?
I thought if I helped you...
if you needed me, you'd let me in.
what are you talking about?
I saw what you have:
your house, your friends, your job.
I wanted that too.
I wanted what I used to have.
I had a wife, a son. I lost everything!
anyone you'd like to pray for?
you seem troubled. I'll pray for you.
I've been doing this for over 200 years.
you've done it for 6.
dammit, and you still look 25.
sometimes I think: "If I'd just turned a little earlier...
I remember six.
you still remember the faces of the people that you've killed, most of them anyway.
but they're just starting to fade now, aren't they?
I have killed so many people...
that their faces are a blur.
I used to think that I would go crazy trying to remember.
but when you can't, when there's too many, when it has been too long...
that's when it gets scary.
or liberating.
I've seen people come in here.
they sit, pray. They seem at peace.
church is a sanctuary, right?
does it mean the same for you now as before you turned?
when there's no one here, when it's empty...
I can feel him here with me.
I've stopped... feeding.
and this whole hospital, I need it.
I need a place to go where we are not.
so you pick a place full of bleeding bodies to go straight?
I can help people move on to the death that I will never have.
you're lying to yourself.
if you wanna die, you could end it anytime you want.
we could do it right now.
that's it.
don't... don't fight it.
lean into it. Let it take you.
you want to live, and that's ok.
we all do.
God intended for us to live forever.
Adam and Eve were immortal before the fall.
it's our natural state.
I am the resurrection and the life.
he who believes in me will live, "even though he dies.
I get it. You're completely unhinged.
no more.
the first time we met...
I don't blame you.
you had no control.
you didn't know what you were doing.
but the second...
you should have stayed away.
all I wanted was to find the last person I had a connection with.
the connection of a murderer to the man he's killed?
you don't know what it's like.
I've been so lonely for years.
you expect me to feel sorry for you?
you think you're better than me?
you think you won't do what I've done?
I'm not like you, Ray.
the wolf is you, and you are the wolf.
the only difference between you and me is that I know what I am.
I accept it.
and I never will.
give it a few years, or five, or ten.
this is it, Josh.
it's a life sentence, brother.
one day, you'll know what it's like, everything I'm saying, and you'll come looking for me!
who did this?
your psychotic protégé.
fix me.
Aidan can be an animal.
I'm sorry. Living is the one flaw in our evolution.
fangs don't grow back.
wha-what am I gonna do?
how am I gonna eat?
I told you, we are a family. We'll take care of you.
I...
how will I survive?
my God!
Oh man...
did you leave the door unlocked?
what? Are you kidding me?
I can't believe this.
just...
Oh God!
Oh no...
how'd that get there?
I'm gonna check the bedroom. - No, wait.
what if they're still here? You should call the police.
you guys coming?
dinner.
OK...
you remember that neither of us actually eats, right?
well, fake it, you know?
do what all the anorexic girls in my high school used to do.
push your food around, nibble, pretend to chew, whatever.
I don't care.
we are all sitting down to a hot, delicious meal together.
OK.
OK...
we have to hang on to some rituals of normalcy.
divine.
thank you.
see?
this is nice. It's been...
well, never since we all shared a meal together.
you're right! Thanks, mom.
Aidan told me.
I'm so sorry. Do you...
there's nothing more to say.
how was work? I didn't see you on the shift today.
OK then.
so, what happened with Ray?
ray's gone.
and the other night, those, uh, degenerates you rolled?
fun tidbit.
turns out that Ray...
is the one that did this to me.
he made me what I am.
you're kidding.
are you ok?
Oh yeah, I'm awesome. I'm incredible.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna meet their were-dad?
could you pass the salad, please?
my brother had a nervous breakdown and ran away from our family.
just leave me alone.
you screw me. You kill me. You never call.
I can't go to a restaurant and pretend to be human when all I wanna do is eat the table next to me.
I will be strong for both of us.
I lost my engagement ring.
why'd you take it off? - You know I love that ring!
Danny killed me.
what sets a human apart from a monster, aside from genetics?
aside from the terrible truth?
we walk the same streets. We wear the same clothes.
you take a breath, and there we are, gulping the same air.
we're walking in your footsteps.
and even a monster can posses that most dominant of human emotions...
fear.
we know enough to remember what we once were.
we know enough to fear what we can now do.
and, like a human, we obsess over love, over life, over every lost cause.
the Vatican Tweets!
I hate this decade.
is that you? Sorry.
how are you doing that, anyway?
you can't...
touch anything, do anything but make the house shake.
I know.
maybe because it's mine.
maybe because it's supposed to be on my finger.
but I thought that Danny took it.
he did. Then how did it get here?
Aidan, I'm pretty much not gonna have the answer to any of these questions.
you look nice.
is that... you wearing perfume?
so, it's like a charged object, right?
right.
so I should do something with it.
wait a second. Hold on.
when you say "do something" , you don't mean with Danny, right?
I'm sorry, am I supposed to be over the whole wrongful-death thing by now?
you were the one who said you'd take care of him.
because I didn't wanna see you get hurt.
Hey, listen to me. The more involved you get, the more caught up you get in revenge.
you will be stuck, Sally.
is it picture day at school?
what's up? Nothing is up, OK?
you just notice it more because you can't change clothes.
mail call.
is that Rebecca? Um...
who's Rebecca?
are you two...
no.
No!
OK, yeah, porn before breakfast? Really?
we don't need to see this. - Hey!
stop! I mean, let it.
that's a good dress.
OK... What is this?
Hi, boobs!
Oh... What?
is she... She's a vampire?
Oh my God! Oh, she's eating his face!
she's eating his face!
what is she doing? Oh my God!
turn it off! Turn it off!
there's so much blood!
what the hell was that?
EW, ew, ew! Is that what vampires do?
they get off on this, don't they? Some do.
so, is it something you like?
what?
No!
No! No.
someone's just trying to mess with me.
I will get rid of it. Don't worry.
I... I should, um...
I should get to work.
we have the same weaknesses as you.
but even this doesn't make us normal.
but it does make us unforgetttable.
Hey. How's your day going so far?
Oh, not bad.
fender-bender, enema.
same old. Well, I hope the two weren't related.
so, they sent Mr. Calambey home?
his burns healed nicely. Yeah! Minor miracle.
I'm not going anywhere near my deep fryer anytime soon!
how can you even own one of those? The fat alone is just...
Oh no, I was...
no, I was kidding. I was kidding.
because men enjoy torching things.
so, you like to cook?
Yeah, I always thought it would be my other profession if I didn't go into...
so, I'm in this rehabilitation program.
trying to prove to Nora Sorgent,
I'm an upstanding member of society and not a raging ass hat.
hmm. That must be a new program.
is. - How's it going?
????
although I'm not really putting in the effort that I'd like.
Oh, well, one day at a time.
Yeah. Uh, so...
I was wondering if maybe you might want to eat sometime.
uh, wow, like tomorrow.
because you're not working the night shift, and, hey, neither am I.
so what a serendipitous bit of scheduling.
well, I do need to eat.
see you later, dough eyes.
well, that was fast.
I told Rebecca you'd be another day.
I thought you'd wanna watch it a few more times.
can I talk to you alone?
I'm fine here. Really?
a porno? That's your big move?
Bishop likes to think of it as a video postcard of sorts.
wish you were here.
what are you doing? What?
you didn't like it? Bishop knows where I stand.
a pathetic snuff film isn't gonna change my mind.
fair enough.
give it back, and I'll dispose of it.
you kept it!
so you do miss me.
don't do that.
you...
you don't want me back.
you ever thought of what might happen?
Yes, it's all I think about.
it's all any of us think about, really.
you would be nothing all over again, and you know it.
Yap, yap, yap.
you and all the little doggies!
I thought you had a hold over him.
I guess I was wrong.
it would have been fine if you weren't here.
I can do it. That's what you keep saying!
and yet...
is it true what they say about Aidan and Bishop?
they weren't gods.
are you in love with him?
what would be the point?
are you OK?
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm...
maybe. Do you think if you mention food to someone and they say they like to eat, technically, it's a date?
no. - No?
well, actually, what she said was...
I guess I have to eat.
who?
Yeah.
she's speaking to you? - Yes!
and possibly eating with me.
I guess I have to eat... - No, yeah.
it's not dripping with enthusiasm.
but it's not a no.
it's not a no. Mm-mmm. - Not a no.
what? You're doing it.
don't jinx it!
it does make me wonder, though, you know, what that would be like...
be someone's boyfriend again.
share a paper, see a movie.
sounds like retirement. Is sex in this equation?
what?
I'm sorry.
I just didn't know where else to go.
so, what brings you here?
how about...
are you OK, Emily?
are you... Are you OK, Emily?
I know you don't wanna see me. OK? I get it.
Jackie and I broke up.
that's rough. Thank you.
and I can't keep living in there, and it's too late to find a roommate this semester.
so...
I need a place to crash, OK?
uh, OK, see, I... - Aidan's OK with it.
right?
she's your sister.
how long?
just till I get back on my feet.
can I have this cookie?
Hello?
hello.
Hey, did someone call...
Aidan, hey.
did you call about the sink?
did we?
uh, yeah, my bad. Come on in.
what the hell are you doing?
you think you'd get away with killing our girl?
any preference? Just make it hurt.
I know. She disgusts me.
the thought of her... Like, ugh!
she makes me wanna lick a guy from head to toe.
get the blood out of the fridge. And then the porn?
we'll lose the snuff film, right?
I told you I took care of it! - OK!
Hey, listen, a couple of days, right?
huh? - We were human once.
we can do this! All right. Come on.
what the hell is this?
what's it look like? I'm freaking out.
no, no, no freaking out! Not now!
Emily's here. Everyone just be normal.
how am I supposed to be normal?
I need to talk to you.
and here we are. Why are we shaking?
that's your sister? She's so cute!
that's The T train. The T train.
well, that blows. You could crash somewhere else.
Hey! That's your sister. Tell her she's welcome.
make yourself at home.
I can't even see through the haze of warm and fuzzy!
please tell me you have booze in there.
help yourself.
stop shaking the house right now.
Yeah, can't. It' called a crisis.
not my fault! I Swear! - No worries!
try!
OK, when you whisper to me, it makes me feel like a ghost.
and that makes it worse.
stop shaking!
why are there, like, 5 rump roasts in your freezer?
are there?
OK, so, dinner, right?
what do people like to eat?
what do we, the people, like to eat?
aidan's hot.
sometimes I wish I was into that.
Jackie would so freak!
Yeah, you don't wanna...
that is complicated.
um, yeah, part of the appeal!
how's things going on your front?
Oh, good.
work's good.
girls, Josh. Life.
are you OK?
because last time, you weren't.
Yeah.
look, I know I said some things, I apologize
forget about it.
you owe me one.
I told mom and dad I saw you.
but, see, there you go.
all even!
em... - You're their son!
they're worried about you.
they didn't even know you were alive.
what did you tell them?
what do you think? Everything.
since you asked, I did ask someone out.
and it's vaguely possible that she said yes.
you dog, you!
it's not like we...
I mean, we haven't, you know, yet.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. So don't care!
another beer?
you coming?
the food's getting cold. What?
Yeah, right. Right.
I know. It sucks.
I could make you feel so much better if you could actually hear me.
my fiance killed me.
I guess you're happy things didn't get that bad with what's-her-name.
I bet you wanna get back at her. Right?
make her feel bad?
because what is she really doing?
she's just gallivanting around, right?
totally fine with the fact that she decimated you.
don't you feel like we should do something?
good morning! Oh, apples!
this place is freezing.
I'm getting a sweater.
what?
I know you're frustrated. Frustrated?
I'm dead.
I think maybe that ring is maybe what's making you so jittery.
you should get rid of it.
I can't.
it's attached to me.
it's basically a murder weapon, you know?
it's the reason I died.
so you've tried to get rid of it?
let's go back to when you wanted to rip his head off.
I like that Aidan!
Yes, I've tried to get rid of it!
whatever I do, it comes back to me.
like when it fell down the drain.
the house wouldn't rest till it came back to me.
I've been thinking about it.
it wasn't the house. It was you,
I need to do something.
like what?
like push Danny down every staircase in Boston.
like make him see my face in every shadowy hallway.
like... Like make him choke on this damn ring every time he takes a bite of food.
you think I wanna be shaking this house?
I wanna shake his very existence!
but this...
this is all I have.
you know what? Let me... Let me get her coffee.
you don't have to do that. - No, really.
thank you.
so...
so, I hope this doesn't count as our date, because I was really hoping to do better than cafeteria coffee.
you'd have to spring for a croissant to get in my pants.
Oh... - I'm... I'm kidding.
right. Right. Me too.
so, we are having a date?
I thought so.
is this a thing that you do?
you turn it around so the girl ends up asking you out?
slick! No, I just wasn't...
OK. So, dinner at my place.
here is my address.
so, now you have it.
I will treasure this cup always.
see, you want me to think that you're joking, but I really have no way of knowing.
maybe you have a treasure trove of stalker paraphernalia.
Yes, because I'm the strange one here.
Exactly! - Yeah.
um... OK, so I'll see you tonight.
OK. - All right.
Hello?
Oh God!
why didn't you say anything?
are you messing with me, Bridg?
what are you talking about? I just got here.
then what the hell is this?
are you messing with me?
stop!
Danny, you're hurting me!
you still watching that? Oh, don't do that!
I could come back.
sorry. It's just...
Emily's drinking alone downstairs and it's all starting to feel creepy and lonely.
what's going on? I messed with Danny with the ring.
and it felt really briefly satisfying.
is that awful?
I don't wanna see you do anything that will mess with your karma, you know?
Hey, look, I lived through the '60s, a few of them.
I can talk about karma without irony.
are you in love with Elvira?
I feel responsible for her.
Why? She looks like she can take care of herself.
maybe.
Oh, yum!
relax.
I got another bottle of vodka. What?
I don't even drink vodka.
Oh, so that was all me.
you know what? You should go out.
just, you know, be young, wild.
as soon as possible.
I have a date.
that girl whose pants you're too scared to unbutton?
Yes. Thank you.
what do you say? Mind if I brown bag it?
you can do whatever you want.
she cannot do whatever she wants.
P. S.
relax, narc.
Yeah, no, great, you go ahead.
I'll stay here, do nothing, again.
you know what?
why don't you all go out and just have a great time?
I'll get it! - I'll get it!
No! You stop now!
no, no, no!
Oh, hello. - Hi!
Nora, Emily. That's my leaving sister.
come in. Come on in.
Josh, she is so hot! Look at her boobs!
I've always wanted boobs like that. Come in! Come in!
how about a vodka shot?
Emily, she doesn't want a vodka shot, OK?
she's an adult. - One shot.
you're gonna have the best night!
this doesn't suck. You want a drink?
I've been drinking since breakfast.
all right, I'm going in. Hmm, feels like a redhead kind of night.
just have fun.
your description of this place? Not accurate.
I ended up in what might have been the basement of a serial killer.
you should probably look into that. I'm never going out again.
human boys.
he doesn't know what he's missing!
seriously. Freaking eunuch.
let's go pour a drink down his pants.
his junk will shrink like a toe in a tub.
Josh, this is shockingly good!
thank you.
but the torch really did the heavy lifting.
who has a kitchen torch besides Martha Stewart and her newlywed minions?
that's something you register for and never take out of the box.
what, you were engaged?
were you married?
Oh no, no. And...
what happened?
it's a long story.
um... it just didn't end well.
too young?
Yeah. Um...
I changed.
you answer questions like an escaped convict.
what? - Mm-hmm.
yeah?
mysterious. - Yeah...
not too much detail.
well, the details would bore you.
I'm a Jewish kid from Ithaca.
as in Ithaca is gorgeous? - Yes.
cute, dough eyes!
what about college?
MIT.
shut up! - Yeah, anyone can get in.
screw you!
what are you doing folding hospital corners?
life experience.
more wine? I should get more wine maybe.
this is gone.
Lindsey. Aneurism. 1991.
Oh... at your age?
I know, right? Wicked tragic!
so, how'd you bite it?
my fiance killed me.
shut up! - Can't.
Oh! Wow! How mad are you?
I desperately wanna wreak havoc on Danny, but my friend Aidan thinks it's a bad idea, like I'll be stuck here or something. That's a bunch of bull!
you're just supposed to let Danny get away with it?
Yes, that's what I think. But he's...
no, we'll figure it out. Screw Aidan!
no one gets what we're going through but us!
Oh, honey, you're so happy you've met me!
holy mother.
that looks like a girl that forgot her underwear.
what are you doing here?
painting the town red.
wanna come?
OK, so, I'm gonna go to a place that is not here.
I like your new girlfriend.
that's Josh's sister.
are you running a kennel now?
she didn't smell like a bitch.
I don't have anything to say to you.
you wouldn't have shown up the other day looking for me if you had nothing to say. You are a lost cause.
we have eternity, and you're really gonna give up now?
they sent you that DVD because they think I affect you.
brilliant!
pretend I don't. Whatever.
I spend half my time trying to forget about you, too.
I give up.
I like these plates.
they've got character.
Thanks. Yeah, we found 'em at a flea market.
Aidan had a few from an old set, so...
is that how you two ended up living together?
your love of vintage china?
um... actually, no.
we, uh... We met in a fight.
well, sort of a fight.
I was... I was being fought.
Pummelled, really.
so, you're an antiquer, not a fighter.
much hotter.
Seriously? No.
but that's OK.
you're scared. I saw it.
before or after I ripped that joker's neck off,
I loved it.
even if I didn't,
I'm supposed to disobey, go against King Bishop?
you killed me, but he made me.
at the hotel, I looked up and you were gone.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
by going back to Bishop? To Marcus?
you're probably just doing their bidding by talking to me now!
I was. Marcus brought me here tonight. Oh God, Rebecca!
why do you think I'm telling you?
I'm coming clean. I can't do this.
what do you want from me? I'm screwed, Aidan!
anything I do!
you know that!
I shouldn't have let you walk inside that night.
I should have just walked away and let you live your life.
I wasn't living it that well.
can I help you with that?
I'm a skirt chaser, babe.
but I'll take a light if you got it.
so, do you come here a lot?
I go wherever he goes.
who's that? The douche who went on without me.
you can call him Bill.
coming to these places night after night, trolling for some girl dumb enough to lick his rotted herpes face for a night.
it makes me sick.
let's go say hi! - Hmm?
please don't. So, what are you gonna do?
I don't know. What do you feel like?
make him think he's seeing maggots in his whisky?
make his teeth fall out while he talks up a slut?
you can do that? I can make him think it's happening.
see, that's why you look so sad, honey.
you're wasting your time trying to be a ghost.
being a ghost is boring! I know.
but a poltergeist...
delicious!
what are you saying?
get 'em off! Get 'em off me!
get out of the way! Move!
get it off me!
Danny can't even hear me!
how do you do that?
honestly, for the first five years, I couldn't do squat.
but for the past 15, hello!
I know, I should probably just kill him, right? Buzz kill!
Fatal-attraction ghost. Wow!
so, what about your door?
my what?
your door. You know, how you move on.
move on to what?
I'm sorry, babe, I gotta go.
bill hasn't gotten his rocks off in five years.
you know why? Vigilance!
well, come find me sometime, yeah? We'll get your guy.
well, now! Sorry, did I...
relax. I've got a good right hook if I need it.
OK. Just...
am I being too...
you're being too polite. - Yeah, I just...
I just wanna make sure.
yeah...
what happened to you?
just... - Yeah, OK.
ah jeez! Sorry, sorry.
you were heavy petting, so I hid here.
who are you talking to?
who the hell is here this late?
yes?
have we met? No, sorry.
I'm Josh.
Oh, right, the boyfriend.
what?
um... I think this belongs here.
isn't this Danny's? It's not Danny's. It's mine.
just put it somewhere, OK?
I'm pretty sure it belongs here.
OK.
good night.
where to?
uh... I gotta go.
what? I gotta...
I left Emily and it's late. I should take her home.
you're kidding me, right?
I...
I really... No. No. No.
I gotta go.
so, let the dog catcher take her home.
come on.
Ugh, I'm not doing this for Bishop.
I told you, to hell with them. Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Yes. Yes, it does.
it really does.
but I... I can't get into it tonight.
maybe they have a point!
Marcus and the rest.
at least they stick together.
I'm sorry.
you know, you, um...
you really don't have to go.
it's late. I should.
did you arrange this or something?
I swear...
Oh my God! Josh...
Oh no!
what happened? What happened? I'm sorry, Josh.
I know you guys wanted to be alone.
I'm sorry. I... No, we're taking her to the hospital.
I don't need to. I... I don't want you guys to...
we're going, OK? We're going.
can you stand? Can you walk?
Mm-hmm. - All right, come on. Come on.
where are they?
the hospital.
where the hell is it? - Ah!
Danny killed me.
are you messing with me? -Bridge.
I wanna shake his very existence.
Unh! - There's an order now. There's Bishop and there's me.
what's it gonna be? Us or them?
I choose them.
I told Mom and Dad I saw you. - What did you tell them?
my sweet brother went mad.
can I help you with that?
Oh my God! - Oh no!
there's a reason monsters hide under the bed.
we're more scared of you than you are of us.
that look on your face, that scream on your lips when you eventually see us...
it's enough to make us forget we were ever humans at all.
she has a pretty bad gash on her head...
some bumps and bruises.
and, um, where exactly were you?
I am going to find who did this.
and what? Kill them?
she was drunk, Aidan.
some guy came on to her in an alley.
she probably pissed him off.
and he was probably drunk, which is why I asked you to watch her.
so...
just don't do anything.
Josh, I... I'm sorry.
phone call please, Dr. Roberts.
phone call please.
what did Emily say about the man who attacked her?
what? I don't know.
what did he look like?
I don't know. He offered her a light.
that it's? That's all he said?
he gave her some fake creeper name.
Marcus, Michael, I don't know.
Marcus? He said "Marcus"?
I never thought you would stoop to this, cleaning up Marcus' mess.
Marcus' mess?
he needs to be punished. - For what exactly?
your roommate coldcocking him in an alley or because you started doggy daycare in the first place?
Marcus beats up 19-year-old girls??
that's the program you're running now?
the program is a little bit different since the last time I saw you.
it is out of control, even for you.
Oh, I'm in control. You're the one who's slipping, Aidan.
Marcus was provoked by a lesser being. He retaliated.
time was, you would've done the same thing.
you know we arrested somebody last week whose pit bull killed a little girl?
you let your dog run wild, Aidan.
the rest is justice.
you and Emily need to get out of town.
what? Why?
because you can't be a werewolf and tear up a vampire on their own turf.
do you know what you've brought on yourself, on us?
wait. What? - Marcus.
Mm-hmm, yeah. Josh, the one who jumped Emily, he is a vampire and he is one of the worst.
how do you know that?
that cop you talked to... I tried to tell you.
Josh, there is an order to things, and Bishop...
he's a vampire too? God, Aidan!
shut up! Shut up!
you and Emily, you need to leave town.
and I need to fix this.
it's that shred of humanity that makes us eventually crawl out from under the stairs and show ourselves to you.
because even a monster can be afraid of the darkness.
bridge. I'm here.
can you hear me?
I know what he's doing to you. You're not alone.
come on, just hear me out.
really, you can't hear me?
I'm a ghost. I transcend pseudohippie rock.
leave me alone! Do you hear me?
get out of this house.
get out of my head.
just leave me the hell alone!
hey
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fine.
I'm not even on the good painkillers. -We're going to the house, -we're getting your things and we're going. -Where?
we'll figure it out.
it's not safe here, Em.
that... guy who jumped you...
he's still out there.
Oh God! He was some douche I jock-walked, OK?
he's not a mass murderer.
em, just... please.
only if you take me one place.
Yes, of course. Anywhere.
Hiya.
what's going on? I know we haven't had a chance...
I think Danny's hurting Bridget and he's a psycho.
I went over there to tell her that he's a total psycho and she told me to screw off.
and I feel horrible 'cause I gave her the blessing to be with him in the first place.
you didn't know that he was a psycho, so...
I didn't subconsciously know?
I didn't deliberately trick Bridget into dating him because I'm really a horrible, vengeful ghost and I wanted her to suffer like I did?
No! - Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, no, you're a vampire and also a ghost whisperer.
you don't know that.
what if this is about finding your door?
what if part of your closure is protecting Bridget?
like condoms on a bed stand? -From Danny.
how am I supposed to help Bridget if she doesn't want my help?
maybe she isn't strong enough to face the trouble she's in or maybe it's you, not Bridget, that needs to make Danny stop.
I wasn't strong enough in the first place.
Oh, that's not true. You had plans, remember?
you were gonna do something with your life.
you're tough, Sally.
and if you could make any physical impact on me whatsoever...
I'd be wary of you.
you were strong before Danny derailed you.
and you know what he is now.
and he can't hurt you anymore.
two years is too long. They're gonna freak.
you'll be fine. -No, there will be freaking.
Josh, Dad caught me macking with Amy Brennan full-on second base right there.
did he freak?
you got to second base with Amy Brennan?
that's like my bucket list.
it's Mom and Dad.
you're like the prodigal son returned.
Oh my God! Your father's gonna have a stroke.
I'm fine.
Hi, Mom.
thanks for bringing this one home.
OK, so we're gonna go inside, we're gonna put something into that stomach and then we're gonna go see Dr. Ruben.
he's my paediatrician. - Since you were nothing.
so he knows your body better than anybody.
well, you got that werewolf sister pretty good.
if Aidan had been attacked by a pack of dogs, he would've done the same thing.
and you would've slapped him on the back for a job well done.
Aidan never got himself into embarrassing situations like this.
I think you've done enough.
yeah?
I'm making chicken. You hungry?
OK.
Hey, is Mom existing in a parallel universe right now?
what do you mean? -You don't think she's acting a little strange, like I just got home from summer camp?
she's making chicken!
what would you like her to do?
I don't know. She hasn't seen me in 2 years.
show some emotion? How about a guilt trip?
mom's not gonna say anything, Josh.
she's... she's terrified.
of me? -Of losing you.
and Dad? What?
he's so scared of me he can't even bother to show his face?
dad doesn't live here anymore.
because?
they're separated.
since when? -Since when do you think?
good, you can help me with the salad. -You're separated?
Yes, but... you don't have to worry about that.
Yes, yes, I do because, apparently Mom, -I'm the one who caused it. -Can we just...
I would rather discuss this when your father's here, ok?
I'm uncomfortable with that. I don't...
Hello? Josh.
good to see you.
Thanks, yeah.
can we... Do you mind if we... we...
I lost it, OK? I flipped out and I am so sorry if I caused or contributed to whatever happened here, OK?
but it's just... It's vitally important that you both know I'm OK.
whatever it was that I had, it's under control.
I've seen a doctor, I'm on medication,
I'm working in a hospital in Boston.
I'm actually sort of... happy.
really. So just...
you don't... you don't need to worry about me, OK?
thank you, Josh, for sharing that.
Yes, thank you.
OK, guys, seriously, can we just stop thanking each other and act like blood relatives for a minute?
?? You don't have to treat me with kid gloves either.
if you wanna shout, shout.
OK.
so long has it been, Josh?
uh, how long has what been?
how long have you thought you were a werewolf?
did I just... Did you just say...
did I just hear you say that you thought that I thought that I was a...
where did you get that?
that's my personal...
that's... that's not even...
do you really think that I think that I'm a werewolf?
do you, Josh?
no, Mom! God!
I... Why would you even think that?
scientific research has confirmed one fundamental fact:
I'm a werewolf.
but my research has yet "to answer the most important question: Why?
Yes.
you think that's me.
guys! I hate to break it to you, but those are... that... those are notes for a graphic novel about a guy who thinks he's a wolf.
guys.
tell you what.
let's eat, catch up and... then we can talk.
let's do that.
as it is the business of any legal action to discover if compelling evidence may be produced.
that's right.
how does it feel?
maybe one tenth of how scared you made me?
Sally, is that you?
cause if it is,
I've got a question for you.
that's the best you've got?
a busted light bulb and some spilt beer?
this is supposed to scare me? Really?
God, Sally!
you're more pathetic as a ghost than you were alive.
and let's just be clear here. That's pretty pathetic.
what?
you know, I heard about you roaming the halls of our old place.
baby, that's just sad.
you still don't have anything better to do than wait for me to come home.
that's never who I wanted to be. You made me into that!
and all that crap about how I made you give up your dreams.
you were just waiting for me to knock you up so you could sit at home and watch Lifetime.
shut UP!
you know, you might scare Bridget with this crap, sweetheart, but you don't scare me.
because I know you're nothing.
you're dead.
and I'm alive.
I'm alive.
and I'm happy...
finally.
so...
at least you got your next book, right?
mom has a breakdown, Emily starts kissing girls and your son thinks he's a werewolf.
you gotta admit, it's pretty much the psychotherapy jackpot, don't you think?
don't do that. -Don't what?
don't shrink me.
you said you wanted to talk. Let's talk.
I'm just trying to understand.
so ask! Scream... I'm your son.
you can talk to me.
I'm sorry. I...
thought you needed help. I got scared.
I swear to God, if that's my high-school math teacher here for an intervention, I'm gonna cut my face off.
just hear me out. I can help.
what? You can't be here.
Josh, Josh, let me in. - No, no!
this is my family. -You must be Josh's mother.
Yes. -I'm Aidan.
I'm Josh's roommate.
he's just passing through. He's leaving.
actually, I'd kill for a glass of water.
Oh, well, we can do better than water.
you like roast chicken? - No, Mom.
I love roast chicken.
good. Well, all right then. Come on in.
so, Aidan, you and Josh met at the hospital.
we did.
their place is actually decent, Mom.
not your typical bachelor-roofie den.
Ah, that's reassuring.
uh, this chicken is delicious.
thank you, Aidan.
so Josh says that he's happy.
see, are you two, uh, happy as roommates?
mom!
we are. -Yeah, he is, really.
you don't mind if I... - If you what?
Josh had a girl over the other night.
Ahem! No, I don't mind. Please continue.
just a great girl.
smart and funny. And I don't mean to sell your son out.
no, of course not.
but get a couple glasses in him, and he actually knows how to charm a lady.
we're OK with drinking on the medication?
I'm not... I don't...
do that.
no, I think it's good to have other forms of... recreation.
Oh my God! - I'd be worried if you were spending all the time on that book.
what book?
my graphic novel, ahem, about werewolves that my family thinks is a personal journal.
my personal journal.
hold on for a second.
so...
OK, you think that Josh thinks that he's a werewolf?
right? It's nuts on toast, right?
Yeah.
so, guys, can we put this to bed now please?
I'm not crazy. It's not a journal, OK?
I don't believe that I'm a wolf. I don't believe in monsters.
you know why? 'Cause there's no such thing as monsters.
Aidan, are you OK?
I'm fine. I'm sorry.
here's the deal. You know what?
?? He just went through a bad breakup.
I'm gonna go check on him because I don't think he's all right.
just something happened.
I... I don't know. Uh...
are you kidding me? Now? You have to do this now?
does your mom cook with garlic? -I don't know.
seriously, is that a thing?
yes or no, Josh! - I guess so.
does it kill you? -No, no, it doesn't.
it just... It makes us, us.
OK, OK, so stop being you.
how? How do we do that? -Uh, feverfew.
fever... what? Is that a band?
it's an herb, Josh!
OK, how about any other herb? Any other herb, like, on earth!
mistletoe?
how about matzo meal?
anything I don't have to summon a warlock for?
OK, all right.
everything's fine.
aidan's just having a reaction to something he ate, so I'm bringing him some camomile tea, some camomile tea.
OK, OK. So we have camomile- lavender, camomile-mint.
I think there's like a lemon in here.
and you're naked and taking a bath in the middle of dinner.
out!
um, I don't wanna be in here.
out! Out! Out!-OK, fine, good.
you got rain on the drive, huh?
well, they said we might get some tonight.
Hello, Josh.
don't open that door.
do not invite that man into this house. Just don't!
what? Oh, this is ridiculous!
no, Dad, don't!
Josh, why don't you tell me what you think is happening right now?
son, this isn't a solution.
take this. - Josh.
??? If he gets inside, you need to cut his head off.
cut it off completely.
do you understand me? - What?
OK, yes, keep them behind you, all right?
Josh! This is crazy!
just do what I say.
Josh, what's going on? - Not now, Dad.
the lengths you go to, to protect them now!
and the lengths you'll go to, to kill when you tell Bishop you failed!
Bishop didn't send me.
whatever's going on, Josh, we can sit down and talk about it.
he didn't ever want me to mess with his little prince's pet.
so you come out here on your own to the suburbs to what?
kill them all?
who are you trying to hurt?
the dog you keep saying is beneath you, or me?
if this is about us, then you keep it between us! Oh!
Bishop would never let me do what I truly wanna do with you.
come on out!
here, boy!
Oh my God! - Josh, put it down!
Josh, wait!
come on, little doggie!
I got this.
you kill me now if you think you've got it in you and you pay the price of Bishop, but you leave my friend and his family out of it.
you and your doggie aren't worth it.
I know you don't wanna admit it.
you think it'll get better in a couple weeks.
hmm? A couple months.
if you wear a new dress.
if you try a new position.
if you bake the perfect frigging cake.
this isn't you, Bridget.
and it wasn't me.
it's just how Danny got into our heads.
and I swear to God I'm gonna make him stop.
but I need you to help me.
I need you to understand what he did to me.
I know you feel me.
are you there?
why are you doing this?
he killed me
you need help.
there's no way to fix what's wrong with me.
there is always a solution.
no, there isn't.
you just need to be open to accepting it.
you...
just refuse to see this as anything other than black and white, don't you?
like you always did, like we're part of your next study.
you keep saying that.
is that how you feel? Like I've studied you?
no, if you'd studied me, you would've realized something was wrong.
let me ask you something.
before I left, before I flipped out, did it ever occur to you that I was unhappy?
you were driven. - You were driving me!
what are you saying? You don't have a problem?
because healthy people don't do this, Josh.
healthy people don't run out on their family, without more than a scrap of paper saying "I'm sorry.
maybe I pushed too hard.
but only because you always acted like that was what you wanted out of life.
son...
you can't possibly want this.
we'll help you, Josh, whatever this is.
please! You can't possibly want this.
I don't.
you're right.
you're right.
it's not a graphic novel.
it's not fantasy.
it's happening to me.
what is happening to you, baby?
I'm a werewolf.
that's who I am.
that's why I left.
what possible place is there for me here?
are you OK?
I need you to tell me how Sally died.
you know how she died.
you were practically the first to know.
keep going, Bridge. You're doing the right thing.
did you kill her?
what? How could you...
how could you say that to me?
cause I think that's what she's saying to me.
finally.
it was an accident.
so it's true?
No! No.
look, Sally and me, it wasn't like how you and I are, Bridget.
we weren't happy.
I never fought with anyone like I fought with her.
she made me so...
I wasn't myself.
so it's my fault?
she was so strong!
you know how Sally was.
I felt like she didn't need me. I got insecure.
so you had to beat me down.
and that night, she lost her ring. -The ring.
she said it went down the drain.
and I didn't believe her.
so... we got into a fight.
I grabbed her arm.
she fell, but I would never...
God, I didn't... No.
so she thinks you killed her.
God! Maybe I did, Bridge.
God! Maybe I did, but I never would've...
she was everything to me.
you know, I keep trying to take back that second when her ankle twisted.
Bridget, no, he's not sorry.
you know, every morning, I wake up and I think about how I ruined my life, our life.
Bridget, no.
I loved her so much.
Bridget. Bridget, do not believe him.
it was an accident.
I know that now.
it was strangely thrilling to finally just...
say it to them.
and yet, somehow...
incredibly anticlimactic.
you know, I tried the same thing...
a long time ago.
my wife and my son.
I thought there must be some way to explain it to them, to, uh, be what I had become...
and keep them.
in time, they would understand. They're my family.
that's what I told myself.
what happened?
we should go.
what if you were right?
trying, I mean.
I can manage this. It's one night a month. I can...
no, it's bigger than that.
and Marcus? I mean, what if he's...
I'm supposed to just leave my family if he's coming back?
no, he's not. It's between me and him now.
but, Josh, he was coming after you.
you do not make it safer here.
I can explain it to them...
walk them through it.
they're educated; they're reasonable.
so you explain it to them, and maybe one day, they'll even believe that you are a wolf.
and so they'll build you a cage.
and it'll work.
every month, you'll transform in the comfort of your own home.
and in the morning, your parents will be waiting for you with food and water.
and they will clean you like the day that you were born because...
because he's not a monster.
he's our son.
and he would never, ever hurt us.
so one day, someone will leave the cage unlocked because what's the worst that can happen?
and brutally, against your human will...
you will kill them all.
I won't let it get to that.
I know what I'm doing now. I'll go to the woods.
no matter what you do, they're gonna wanna get involved.
they're your family.
which is exactly why they're defenseless against you.
I've already hurt them too much not to try.
Aidan! Oh, what a nice surprise!
who are they?
well, I told you things had changed.
some things never change.
you stay away from my friends.
sure.
you stink like one, you know?
Yeah, it's all over you.
doggie stink, doggie sweat, doggie tears.
folks are gonna start to wonder.
???-???
how our family could turn its back on its own?
turn its back on the weakest among us?
we have too much to do in too little time to lay waste to the one strength we have.
that goes for the weakest.
and that goes for the mistakes.
so you think Dad's gonna run off with some 25-year-old babe?
how jealous would you be?
how jealous would you be?
you're gonna stay, right? For a while?
I could come home once a month, help out.
whatever you need.
come on.
Josh, come have some chicken.
Hello?
I'm here.
I'm sorry...
about how you died.
and I miss you...
every day.
but this is the last time I'm gonna talk to you.
and if you come to me, if you haunt me or Danny...
I won't acknowledge you...
no matter how loud you scream...
no matter how scared I am.
this ends now.
he'll do it to you.
it's just who he is.
you're not at rest.
I get that now.
but it didn't happen the way you think it did.
just accept that.
accept that and maybe you can find some peace and move on.
we're moving on.
and you need to leave us alone.
and what happened?
the worst.
I have news from Boston, born in concern.
may I see them?
it's two hours until sundown.
I'll wait.
you're more pathetic as a ghost than - you were alive. - SHUT UP!!
I'm not the kind of guy who mounts women spontaneously and has furious animal sex. I can't believe I went with it myself.
I wanna be with you, but there's something in my life.
and we have the numbers and we have the power.
we won't have to hide. We can live right out in the open.
Aidan! Rebecca fixed me. I wish I was like this before, then those boys wouldn't have messed with me.
thank you for taking care of those boys. Whatever I can do.
listen to me! He was out of control.
you couldn't teach him, like you said to me?
the way you live is an insult to the empire they've built.
I'll come back. I'm sorry, could you be a little bit more specific?
come back to... - To you.
I'll come back to you.
the only constant in life is change.
people, as a species, are in a constant state of metamorphosis.
just when we get comfortable swimming in the sea, we end up on land. The moment we become accustom to crawling, we stand on 2 legs. After you.
our instinct is to resist change, to fear it, so we wrap a pretty word like "evolution" around it and hope that it will make the pill easier to swallow.
well... this is one of our better additions to Boston since your last visit.
we've reserved the entire space for your enjoyment. What about the harbour?
again, the harbour isn't what it used to be.
there's too many people there now, tourists, even at night.
but we always go to the harbour. Yes, we like to feed by the water.
Yes, well... Maybe next time.
they aren't chained.
were they compelled? No, there's no need.
the agreement is that we feed, not kill.
they're here by choice.
some, because they hope to be diners someday.
and... some have issues.
but you don't drain them?
we do not feed on blood.
we feed on life. This is appalling.
well, this is a new reality.
we're not asking you to forsake your old ways, but you did say you wanted to see how we lived here in Boston, and this is it.
Fenway Park, Faneuil Hall and Lola.
local treasures all.
the thing is, change doesn't care if you love it or you hate it.
change is indifferent, intractable.
like I said, every cubicle is here for your disposal.
or whatever you're into.
we will try this city feeding.
you won't be disappointed.
and it will not be denied.
but we will do it our way.
so... Aidan's back!
it's wonderful, isn't it?
all of us together again on our last day.
our last day?
there's a traitor amongst us, boys.
someone has told the Dutch everything.
all my plans... well, our plans have come to naught.
today, we will die.
how can you be so sure?
Mmm, it's the cycle of this endless life.
Aidan remembers well enough how these things play out.
so greedy.
and they think we're uncivilized.
Thanks, Jason. Dr. Miller there, you.
you're annoyed. You're mad.
annoyed and mad, and you should be. I'm so sorry.
you vanished, Josh.
for 2 days. - I know.
I'm beyond words sorry. I don't know what to say.
what happened?
you can't tell me.
all I can do is say that I'm sorry again and just pray that you can forgive me.
I'm pregnant, Josh.
you're... pregnant?
with... with my baby? - What?
but, I... - Who else would it be?
I don't... - Wow, wow!
the slut who gets herself in trouble, the bastard who ducks his responsibilities.
I didn't mean it like that. I... I ju...
can we just start over, please?
you know, I've been rehearsing this conversation in my head for 2 days.
but it never went like this. I'm just surprised.
well, you know, we shouldn't be.
it was stupid of us not to use anything!
I just thought that I... What, what? What did you think, Josh?
what? That I was on the pill?
or that if something happened, I'd take care of it?
No! No! - I can't do this right now.
Nora, just... I just wanted you to know.
now, I'm gonna go back to the version of this conversation that I was having in my head, because it was much better.
Nora, don't. Nora...
why are you putting yourself through this?
I owed it to Bishop.
how could you owe him anything?
isn't ruining your life enough?
I don't know. Maybe...
maybe I can make things better for all of us.
my God...
you've been here one day and you've got Kool-Aid coming out of your ears.
Bishop wants to take over the public so that he doesn't have to hide.
but it's his hunger that he really needs to control.
if I can teach him that control over the urge...
Oh! Sorry.
you're serious.
thought you'd appreciate a little hope.
after everything we've been through?
I'm tired of disappointments, Aidan.
I know.
that's why I feel like I owe this to you.
to us.
give up on us.
there's too much blood under the bridge.
and now it's just too late.
Hello? Guys?
you get my message about the exterminator?
Yes, you anal-retentive freak.
they're gone. Spray away.
whoo, there's a lot of energy in here.
you can feel it right when you walk in.
OK...
that's not an exterminator.
so when did you buy this house?
2007
how many spaces?
rooms? Seven.
there's 10 if you include closets.
no way!
she's a realtor?
you're gonna sell our house? My house?
and right out from under the guys?
you really are a piece of crap.
I need to know every space.
look, will this take long? I really can't say.
every place is different.
so long as we can move on. Oh, Bridget!
don't move anywhere with him! You can't!
he's just trying to get you away from everybody else.
that's how it starts.
this is where she died.
why does she care where I died? Uh, do you need anything?
no. I'm good.
so what I like to do is clear the spirits room by room.
clear the spirits?
there's only one spirit. - Of course! Sarah.
Sally. - Oh! Right, Sally.
Sally... Well, after today, you won't have to worry about Sally ever again.
Why?
do you think we could move this along, the, uh... ritual?
the exorcism. Right.
the exorcism?
Bishop suspects something.
what kind of a leader would he be if he didn't?
well, if I'm compromised with him, I wanna be sure our deal is intact. Correct?
was there a deal? Well, an understanding.
you handle Bishop, and I take Boston.
you know, I find, after a number of decades, that a certain grace settles upon us.
I'm sure you'll find the same.
I'm not sure that death is necessary.
isn't it more important that we restore order?
but you...
we all just want what's for the greater good, don't we?
is it Aidan?
you wouldn't make him leader, would you?
because with all due respect, that would be insane.
he's a heretic, a sham.
please do not presume that you will ever tell me anything that I do not already know.
as for the rest, all will be discussed at the meeting.
the meeting? Of course.
salt binds the spirit to the house for the ceremony.
this way, they can't escape and sneak back in later.
she's bound here until she's gone? Yeah, that's how it works.
Pfft! Whatever.
son of a bitch!
it's salt? I mean, it's killer on hardwood.
can't we use something else? Well, we have 2 options.
you can either follow the ceremony to the word or burn this house to the ground.
out on the street. Out on the street!
all right, let's begin. No!
Sally, your friends want you to go now and find the peace that you deserve.
what, that's all there is to it?
you ask nicely? Because we could've done that.
nicely, right. Ghosts were once people.
and people respond to being asked nicely.
please" and "thank you."
I mean, that's always my first course of action.
now, Sally, please, go find your peace.
it's time.
well, this... this might require more than "please" and "thank you."
it's this city air, filthy.
Yeah, secondhand smoke is a killer.
how long's it been? 50 years, that we sat right here.
who could forget?
you murdered Carlo right over there.
Oh, yes.
let a heretic run wild in his care, didn't he?
well, if by heretic you mean me, yes, he did.
youthful indiscretion, I think we can all agree.
and what would you call, uh, this experiment of yours?
living with humans.
youthful indiscretion as well?
I don't live with humans.
is there something else? It's come to our attention that you've been creating a great number of children.
that, furthermore, you have a plan to turn all the right people to bring your family public.
do you deny this?
I do not deny it.
our laws pertaining to the number of family members are quite clear.
it keeps one clan from becoming stronger than the others.
I'm curious about this need of yours to declare yourself to the masses.
would you rather us live in the shadows?
in garages and barns for the rest of eternity?
so you would have us take over humanity by becoming more human?
and after the humans acknowledge our existence, they what?
just... submit?
some will.
some will need to be persuaded.
persuaded? Mass murder, enslavement...
two possibilities.
what?
we've tried to come into the light.
it's never worked, not once in our history.
your plan jeopardizes the existence of us all.
and your plan, your theology, denies the existence of us all.
we are either the master race or we're cowards.
why can't you and the Council see that?
you will cull this clan by two-thirds.
you, Bishop, will come back with us.
there, you will go under the earth for no less than 50 years.
think about it. Discuss.
we will take your answer at tonight's dinner.
take the deal.
and in my absence, when Hegeman and his Taliban have run Boston straight back to the Middle Ages, what then?
Boston will survive, and so will you. Take the deal.
this isn't about survival.
it's what we've always talked about building.
you and I, this is our dream.
we never talked about this.
if you reject the Dutch, then every family in the Council will be after your head.
you... you had the...
Oh my God! I told them to get you.
nobody called? - No.
is it...
is he healthy?
I can't get the little bugger to latch on just yet, but he's perfect.
daddy's here.
No!
no, no, no!
No! Ah!
God, our Father, cleanse this place of the dark remnant dwelling within and fill it with light and love.
be gone unclean spirit.
leave this world for those who still live in it.
God, our Father cleanse this place of the dark, dark remnant.
fill it with light. Why are you doing this?
I left you alone! You won!
God, our Father remove all power from this lost spirit.
power of this lost spirit.
lost spirit. Lost, lost...
leave this world for those who still live in it.
Dr. Johnson, pick up Line 1, please.
you're here.
Yeah, I've gotta keep up appearances.
right, yeah.
I mean, you still work here, all right?
it's there you have to keep up appearances.
that's, like, a show.
like a one night only kind of thing, right?
right? So...
so how is, uh...
how is everything over there with... with them?
everything's everything.
it's everything, sure.
so, are you coming back to the house or...
I don't know. Will you know?
Josh, I don't know!
OK.
you all right?
I'm just concerned about you, really.
and, no, I'm not all right.
Nora's pregnant.
wait, with your... I think so.
Yeah, and I'm sure you already know this.
but, you know, that question, like, the worst thing that you can ask a woman when she announces.
wait, you didn't ask that did you?
I... - Oh!
I didn't think a guy like me could have a kid.
Yeah, me neither! Josh...
Yeah. Right?
so what do you think?
Congratulations.
congratulations? No, thank you.
no, I'm not looking for a cigar, man.
I need help, OK? I... I need...
what do I do?
Josh, I realize that you're freaking out. But listen, this is good.
hell, this is better than good. This is normal.
it doesn't feel normal, OK? If it were normal, I'd be running around telling friends, family, people in line at Starbucks, not pacing the hall trying to figure out how to tactfully bring up an abortion.
wait a second.
you didn't actually have that conversation, did you?
No! I didn't think it'd be a very good follow-up to "Are you sure that's my kid?
but it just feels wrong.
I mean, what if it's like me? What if it's...
what if it's just like me?
I don't know.
but before you talk about doing anything drastic, think about this... You and me...
we agreed to make a go at having a real life.
Yeah. - Right?
I know we did.
looks like one of us is gonna get a shot.
isn't this always the way?
they roll out the red carpet and sweep us right under it.
I thought you'd firmly secured your place amongst the Chosen.
there is no security. You should know that.
not when you're a mistake, like you and I.
excuse my honesty.
I, uh...
I'm in a mood.
because Aidan's back?
how is the world's most loyal bootlicker possibly a mistake?
well, they were coming for my brother.
Bishop and his men, riding high from the slaughter in Concord, drunk on blood and thirsty for more.
I came outside when I heard them in the barn.
they were already on him.
that's... awful.
I hated my brother.
he put up fight, and Bishop liked that.
Yeah, Silas was a soldier.
I'd avoided the war and stayed home to pursue my studies.
so how did they get you?
well, Silas wanted to die with honour, not as a monster, so he took his dagger and slit his own throat.
but Bishop wouldn't go home empty-handed.
that left him with me. I would do.
soon after that, he got Aidan, the good little soldier he'd been looking for.
so you see we're just pawns, you and I.
who do you think killed Bernie's little bullies?
so it was your fault, what happened to Bernie?
we've just been put here as stepping stones to get him back what he really wanted.
pathetic, if you ask me. He's a coward and a traitor.
aren't you betraying Bishop right now, talking this way?
we should help each other, you and I.
don't you see that we're closer than you knew.
give me space, Marcus.
I'm in a mood.
this is it.
are you two ready? Yeah. I don't know.
it feels like it's working.
doesn't it feel like it's working?
it does, yeah.
Bridget, please...
God, our Father... - Stop.
wait. What are you doing?
what will happen to her? Will she go to Heaven?
honestly, I don't know, honey. You don't know?
we only have the ability to get the energy out of a space.
where they go or what they become, it's unknown to me.
I don't know about this. - Seriously?
this whole deal was your idea.
what if she's clinging to this house, to us, for a reason?
this isn't her house anymore!
she's safe here. What if we send her somewhere bad?
send her somewhere bad? We're the ones in Hell!
I mean, every conversation we have turns to Sally.
whenever the wind blows, you think Sally's whispering something to you.
I mean, every night, you think she's watching us sleep.
I just think maybe Sally deserves more.
we deserve more.
don't we?
you have to finish this.
God, our Father cleanse this place of the dark spirit dwelling within and fill it with light and love.
well, gentlemen...
I hope you brought your appetites.
did I mention here that Michelle is pregnant with twins?
don't be shy. Dig in!
she's been compelled so we can enjoy our little delicacy in peace.
it's your decision, Bishop.
is this meal a celebration of your good judgement or a memorial to your stupidity?
my decision...
Yes.
well... business before pleasure, I assume.
I'd like to make a toast. Wait!
nobody wants a war.
not against humanity, not amongst the families.
if Bishop would revise his ambitions, if he would scale them back, then you could truthfully report to the Council that he submitted to your demands while leaving a flawed, but capable leader here in Boston.
and if that's not enough, then you can take me.
I'm the true heretic.
if I were to submit to punishment that might be enough.
and since Aidan is so selflessly willing to submit, maybe Bishop would agree to some sort of power share.
something to make the Council feel more at ease.
well, gentlemen...
I do believe you've just heard the clarion call of surrender, which is kind of funny.
because I was going to stand up here and tell you that I reject your offer.
I reject your theology.
I reject your cowardice.
and I was prepared to stand up here and fight you for what was right.
but I cannot do that alone.
and now it seems I stand here more alone than ever.
my sons in their own way, have rejected me...lost faith in me, deserted me.
well...
these things happen, and so, a new toast.
Mmm, forgive my heedlessness. I accept your terms.
I surrender. My family will be reduced.
Boston is yours. Let's celebrate.
what's the matter? Did you guys eat already?
come on! Celebrate!
I rolled over, tail between my legs, etc. etc.
you don't look so good, old friend.
Oh! You know what I bet it was?
Yeah. That pretty little thing from the blood den.
I probably should've told you she was on a steady diet of juniper.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, all the donors have been noshing on the stuff.
nasty stuff, that juniper.
really slow-acting, but once it kicks in, it really packs a wallop.
everything in the body constricts and stiffens.
they say it's a lot like rigor mortis.
the effects don't last too long, but I only need a couple of minutes to enjoy this.
help.
Oh, they're not gonna help you. Those two?
useless, trust me. Bishop, think about this.
if you only drank a little from the donors, you'd be fine.
but no, you had to follow the old ways and suck them dry.
and as the saying goes...If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
but there is another saying...Change or die." Bishop!
did you really think I didn't have a plan?
you may be older, but you don't have the market cornered on wisdom.
Marcus don't be a fool.
by killing Hegeman and the idiot who tried to help him escape?
Bishop will be so pleased.
Marcus you could come with us.
Yeah, because we're so close, you and I.
don't worry. - Oh!
I'll tell your friends you died screaming like a pig.
let's go!
this was our bedroom. We were half-joking, but we always said this was where we'd make our family.
no.
she wanted that more than anything in the world.
now I can never give her that.
I'm sorry. - It's OK.
you have to finish this.
I can't take much more.
you don't get to talk about me like that.
you don't get to mourn me!
be gone unclean spirit.
leave this world for those who still...
No!
it was too crappy for you. You know I love that ring.
then where the hell is it!
I told you, it fell!
what happened?
is it done? Is she gone? - Alannah?
are you OK?
you!
you did this to me.
no, Sally, no. I didn't mean to.
how could you do this to me?
it was an accident, you crazy bitch!
I HATE YOU! - Why won't you just die?
Danny, stop it!
I'm gonna fix it right now!
Oh God, are you OK? Alannah?
you!
I know what you are.
wait! You have to finish the job.
we already paid.
here, here, here! Here's your stupid money!
what about Sally? What happened to her?
I don't know, but I hope she's still here.
she deserves this place.
and you...
you deserve whatever she does to you. No, no, Sally's a liar.
she just can't stand for us to be happy.
no.
the dead don't lie.
no, Bridget, don't do this. Get out of my way.
you can't just leave me like this!
I won't tell anyone.
they won't even believe me.
what? You think I'd do something to you?
you know that's not who I am.
please, let me go.
let me go!
I'm sorry, Sally.
so, I want to apologize again.
you ever say or hear something so many times that the words lose all meaning? Can we talk?
I'm, like, begging.
hurry up. I've got tons of guys to sleep with.
that's not what I meant when I said that.
Really? What could you have meant?
I didn't think I could get anyone pregnant.
I've got...I have problems, like, deep genetic-level problems.
and I didn't think I could.
that's what that meant.
and it's not just me.
my whole... family's screwed up, so...
that's your big confession?
God, Josh, whose family isn't? Yeah, I know, but really...
I swore that I would never have children.
my God, my family...
things aren't right.
addiction, mental illness, violence...
I'm always so careful with protection.
I'm paranoid, actually.
but that night with you...
I don't know. There was something about it.
something different.
and it wasn't just that you jumped me and it was over in 20 seconds.
Yeah, I think it was at least 30.
I can't blame you for being freaked.
I'm not sure I have it in me either.
I just want you to know that I'm not going anywhere.
well, we don't have to decide right now though, right?
it's still early. Totally.
I'm glad you don't think I'm a slut.
I'm all right. All right, let go. Let go.
are you sure? I'm healing already, yeah.
I have to get back.
you tell them what you saw here.
Oh! He needs to be stopped.
listen to me.
prepare. Prepare for what's coming.
you think he'll make it back?
maybe.
probably.
you had pretty impeccable timing back there.
he had it coming.
you know Marcus was responsible for the bullies?
I don't know why I didn't assume that in the first place.
you need to be careful.
whatever Bishop's thinking, it's obviously well planned.
why would you offer to go underground?
it's because everything I've done here has been a mistake.
I don't think I was so bad.
of course you weren't.
none of this has ever been your fault.
I know.
it's all been out of my control until now.
no, no. Rebecca, no. I'm not meant to be like this.
like you and Bishop.
that night when you were with me...
I was supposed to die.
I am dead.
it's not right that I'm here. I can't do this to you.
I swear that I will do it myself.
Rebecca, we're gonna get out of here.
you have to let me go. I killed Marcus.
but I'm not gonna let them win.
at least give me the dignity to do this myself, before they can.
you always said you didn't want this for me.
I didn't.
so, if you loved me even for a second of this horrible ride, you would let me go.
OK, well, then I'm going with you. No, no.
you have to finish this.
please.
OK.
thank you.
you will leave Jerusalem with the military convoy to Casarea.
to Octavius Messala:
we will race again.
: left, right...
you know we have Simonides arriving, bringing your bride.
be you betrothed to me?
Messala is here!
you could be of help to me, Judah.
whose side are you on, Judah Ben Hur?
it is not a question of sides.
: we should be bringing Pilate to the garrison direct.
look out!
cease him!
it was an accident! Judah!
get up!
crucify the men. Garrote the women.
No! No! - Hear me, Judah.
you have destroyed the house of Hur and me with it!
you are now under the command of Quintus Arrius.
Silence!
how long at the oars? - Almost 3 years.
I was betrayed by a friend.
here is the maximum penalty.
three ships are sighted. Pirates, for sure.
battle stations!
back oars! Back oars!
if this is a Roman ship, I will not let them take you back.
then I must meet this fortunate young fellow.
emperor, I have the honour of presenting to you my son, - Marcellus Agrippa, he has a son.
Octavius Messala. Do you know him?
I >-: Farewell, Quintus Arrius.
I will not disgrace the name you gave me, but I will have my revenge, no matter the cost.
: ... and yet forgive them.
once?
seven times?
no, not once.
not 7 times, but 17 times 7.
we've heard it said: "A eye for an eye.
a tooth for a tooth.
I say to you: Do not fight those that wish to harm you.
if someone hits your left cheek, offer them the right.
if they ask for your tunic, give them your cloak as well.
if they say: "walk this mile with me,
walk two miles.
as you heard it said:
you should love your neighbour and hate your enemy.
but I say to you:
love your enemies, and bless those who curse you.
please, can you help a leper?
: you, leper!
easy! Easy!
Halt!
filthy rat!
you're under arrest in the name of Tiberius Caesar.
stay back!
stay back. Don't you move.
stay back!
: leave her alone!
: filthy Roman!
: this way.
I heard you've only just returned.
where were you?
went outside the city to hear the Nazarene.
blessed are the weak.
the poor shall inherit the Earth.
I think that is wisdom.
the pure in heart.
and who are they?
you'll not find many in a hundred, is all I know.
Hmm! You must try harder.
is that what I must do to win you, Esther?
try harder?
no.
you must let me decide, David.
I would make the right decision.
for once made, it cannot be undone.
I heard of your father's death.
it was that of a true Roman, and an example to us all.
you must be proud of him.
he has my undying respect.
and what brings you to this armpit of a country?
I've come for the games.
games?
well, there are games of a sort.
nothing like Rome.
a chariot race with teams from all around.
arabs, Syrians, Nubians.
: veer aside!
this garrison puts up a team, which always wins, if you call that sport.
it's enough to bring
senator Marcellus Agrippa from Rome.
and little these Jews will thank him, the fractious bunch of malcontents.
there's one such abroad just now, wandering the hills.
they spring up like weeds.
and like weeds, we must cut them down.
there was another stir, too, in the Joppa Gate.
soldiers everywhere.
it's Passover. They should know by now the Romans are on the lookout for trouble.
just telling Esther about the fighting.
and you were not tempted to join in?
where would you and your daughter be if I joined in and got arrested?
we're indebted for your consideration.
Oh, you're indebted for more than that.
who else do you know who would have the pair of you under his roof after you lived with the lepers?
we were purified according to the law.
and who paid for that?
and what did you pay with, if not the proceeds of the business Judah and I once owned?
judah Ben Hur had you crucified in his place.
you do not know that. - I know what I saw!
and I know I gave you both a home, so let's have no more of your sarcasm and your complaints.
you would be best to take heed.
I will not wait forever on you, Esther...
daughter of Simonides.
you are welcome, but where will you stay?
the Senator's retinue will arrive soon and I must accommodate them.
I saw a house across the way closed by order of the governor for some considerable time by the looks of it.
I know the place.
it was the scene of an attack on me when I first arrived 4 years ago.
I had the perpetrators executed and the house left empty as a warning.
well, then it's served its purpose.
you've not been attacked since.
when I make an example, I make an example.
perhaps you might sell the house to me.
well, it seemed a pleasing prospect, beneath the neglect and decay.
you want to buy a house here in Jerusalem?
Oh, no doubt I will sell it at a profit later.
you have no objection to benefitting from my whim in the meantime, do you?
I suppose not.
well, then, we shall consider it mutual understanding.
should we say 50 talents?
all right.
so, Governor, tell me, how much longer do you think you'll be required to serve in this
what did you call it?
armpit of a country?
are you covetous of my position?
because if you are...
I could put in a good word for you with the emperor.
father...
david is insistent I give him an answer.
and if it be "no"?
it cannot be "no."
asa I know he will turn us out.
we will survive.
back with the lepers, begging at the caves?
but you do not love this man.
david knows that.
I have no interest in what David knows.
it is you, Esther.
could you bear to marry such a man as that?
and he has prospered.
forgotten his hatred of the Romans, hatred he used to vent on Judah, on those who tried to live in good terms with their conqueror.
giving up his hatred is not to be held against him.
he gave up nothing.
he just saw where his profit lay.
david Ben Levi has hatred enough in his heart.
then maybe I can erase that...
by being a wife to him.
do not overestimate the power of love, Daughter.
it does not work miracles.
I saw all the work going on.
thought I'd introduce myself.
I have a business. We do many things.
tiles, for one.
you need quite a few up there by the look of it.
Yes, I believe you were here when one fell...
some 4 years ago.
Sextus Arrius now.
I have a Roman name for when it serves.
but I am who I ever was:
judah, son of Jacob, of the house of Hur.
what if you're discovered?
I'm in no danger of discovery.
I am a Roman citizen now with all the benefits of that state.
then it is true.
it was said you were taken away, protected by that friend of yours, Messala, you and your mother and sister.
I have not seen them since that day.
you remember that day, David?
course. I was there.
I know.
I saw you when you stabbed a soldier.
in self-defense.
in the back.
an incident which turned into a riot, for which my family was blamed.
I did not give your name when I was taken or else you would've joined Simonides on the cross.
so you knew of that then?
I saw him as I was being led away in chains.
his daughter, Esther...
what happened to her?
do you know?
no.
so, what's your answer?
I'm not a man you may play with in this way.
I'm not a woman you may threaten.
you've given my father and me a roof over our heads.
for that you have my gratitude.
gratitude is not love, David.
and I do not love you as a wife should.
but I love you.
I love you enough for both of us.
and love will come.
and if it does not?
if you have my child, your heart would warm to the father.
I know it.
you'd come to be all a wife should.
you're not a woman who does things by halves.
take one step.
the other will follow.
very well, then.
I will marry you.
: right, left. Right, left.
right, left. Right, left...
I hope you will find your quarters comfortable.
I do not use this place much.
I'm usually on the coast at Cesarea.
they will suffice.
I am here only to oversee the games in the emperor's name.
he is adamant that by such displays, Rome will be loved.
I think he'll find himself mistaken in the case of these Jews.
you can explain that to him when you are recalled to Rome.
I have yet to see the emperor's orders under his seal.
you will have them. Never fear.
they're on their way, carried by your replacement.
I saw you arrive.
and what a splendid sight it was.
and you are the most agreeable prospect I seen since we left Rome.
so, you were not in jest about coming to this place.
Sextus Arrius has bought a house here.
he seems to find Jerusalem far more congenial than I do.
I suggested he might consider relieving me.
I did not know you had political ambitions, Sextus.
whose magnificent horses are these matched blacks?
they are my gift to the emperor.
after they have triumphed at the games, they will go to him for his stables.
when does Octavius Messala arrive?
Octavius Messala will be here?
I told you your replacement was on his way.
let's hope his entrance is better than his last.
if you will excuse me, there is much I must attend to.
what a popinjay.
I marvel that he has lasted as long as he has.
so, you bought a house here.
I should have thought that your estates in Umbria surpass by far anything that you might find in this land.
I once lived here. A long time ago.
as did your son, if I'm not mistaken.
until I brought him to Rome.
when his life truly began.
it'll be interesting for him to return,
I imagine, to the scene of former triumphs - When can we visit you in your new house?
Oh, I plan a banquet celebrating your being here, as soon as Messala arrives.
well, I will leave you to recover from your journey.
: one!
what is that man doing here?
I do not trust him.
upstart.
perhaps you should let me ask him.
or are you saving me for your son?
: two! Stay in line!
very well.
a slice from a cut loaf is never missed.
: hold up!
forward!
tell your master Sextus Arrius is here.
and to what do I owe this honour?
you spoke of repairs to my house.
: this way.
and you're offering the work?
or you would prefer I went elsewhere.
I can't supply your needs, I'm sorry.
you were at the house only days ago soliciting.
but did you lose interest in profit when you discovered I was not a Roman?
I said I can't help you.
that woman! Stop her!
stay there!
Esther, thank God you're alive!
I asked David if he knew where you were and he told me he didn't.
that would be all.
thank you, sir.
why did you run? - Do not touch me.
if you must detain me, have them do it.
Esther, wait!
what's the matter? What's happened to you?
leave me alone.
leave me alone!
why did you spit on me?
what have I done that you spit on me?
why would I not spit on someone who bargained my father's life for his own?
I had nothing to do with your father's death!
then how is it you are a Roman and he is a cripple?
Simonides is not dead?
no thanks to you.
he was crucified on the eve of the Sabbath and they took him down at sunset before he died.
or am I to be grateful that you Romans allow us these privileges?
I saw him as I was being taken to the galley in chains!
my sentence was life at the oars!
you seem to have rowed your way to freedom.
you once professed to know what was in men's souls by looking into their eyes.
look into mine.
I had no part in it.
if you don't believe that then you can believe what you will.
he denied his part in your crucifixion.
said he had nothing to do with it.
and you did not believe him.
he is a Roman, Father.
soldiers obey him. He even looks different.
he's not the Judah Ben Hur I knew.
and to whom you were betrothed.
all that is in the past.
but he's here. Now.
how is it that someone sentenced to the galleys for life is now wealthy enough to buy back his own home?
unless, of course, he was protected by his friend.
did you look into his eyes, Daughter?
Yes.
And?
I could not see out of my own.
I must speak with him.
do you think he will confess to you what he'll deny to me?
perhaps my eyes will see clearer than yours.
Esther, it's me.
what do you want?
I want to see Esther. Open the door.
this is not the time.
if I say "open the door," you will open it.
this is my house!
you and she live here at my sufferance.
what do you want?
to see you.
that you are safe.
I am safe.
what else?
do I still have your word?
you give short measure now that the business is yours, David Ben Levi.
I've had no complaints from those I deal with.
the Romans?
those whom you swore to resist and drive out?
have a care, Sextus Arrius, that I do not reveal you for what you are.
and what am I?
an imposter.
a traitor.
one who bartered another's life for his own.
or we go to Pontius Pilate and you can tell him your lies and I will tell him mine and we will see who is believed.
this man once worked for me.
I and my family were ruined by his actions against Rome.
he is a liar and a coward.
and a hypocrite.
: look out!
and he still stabs from behind.
it is one thing a man's heart not being in it, but when his body is equally absent?
what ails my beloved?
do whores have beloveds?
a whore's heart longs for un-bought kisses.
Marcellus is curious as to why you're here.
and he sent you to find out.
this is so you know I'm not trying to poison you.
Yes, he sent me to find out, but you have told me nothing.
you've poisoned at his command?
I have indisposed a few in my time.
but I saved the best for myself for when I've had enough of this monstrous world.
but...
your secret is safe with me, Judah, if you were to share it with me.
come to where there are no lies, no secrets, no words.
empty your mind of what troubles you, of why you are here and what you must do.
: we are here to see Judah Ben Hur.
stay here.
it's my pleasure.
God's blessing on you.
Simonides, you must believe me.
I believe you.
daughter, come.
look in his eyes.
the curfew will begin shortly.
I will find you an escort.
I have permission to stay out all night.
it is better that you return.
you have found a replacement.
I saw the girl and how you were with her.
she and her father were once friends of my family.
I thought they were members of it from the warmth of your greeting.
but perhaps she was something more.
I met Esther once before in my life, and she was but a child.
well, she's a child no longer.
I wish you joy of her.
you and I are more alike than you suppose.
we make our way in this world by our wits.
you should trust me, Sextus Arrius or Judah Ben Hur?
whoever you are.
the decree recalling Pilate is there.
do not present it until these games and the Passover have concluded.
let that be Pilate's last duty.
the other is the edict authorizing the release of prisoners for the festival.
he can have that now.
how was the emperor when you left him?
he's grown over-reliant on his commander of the Praetorian Guard, Sejanus.
he's a dangerous man.
he means to be the gate through which all must enter.
it's not bad that the emperor uses such a gatekeeper.
he'll not notice it so much when one is replaced by another.
how long will that be?
I don't mean to spend my whole life here.
did you not live here when you were younger?
exactly, so I know whereof I speak.
we must have patience.
it would be as well if you applied yourself here.
it would help your reputation, should some outbreak need putting down to show Rome she has a man of action.
I'm sure an outbreak would be both raised up and put down with great ease.
there was talk of some King of the Jews proclaiming himself as we came in from the coast.
I've forgotten what a barbarous people they are.
Ah, Gaius Antonius!
this is Octavius Messala come from Rome - Messala and I are acquainted.
still here, Gaius?
Yes.
I congratulate you on your successes in foreign lands.
that's an order from the emperor requiring the release of all prisoners for the festival.
the locals will not thank us for dumping murderers and disease into their midst.
pilate will not be pleased.
pilate will not have much longer to be pleased or displeased.
Octavius Messala will replace him when the festival is over.
so you managed it.
I did not give much for your chances after last time.
you know that was no fault of mine.
you were garrison commander, as I recall.
do not make an enemy of me before it is necessary, Gaius.
let there be no talk of enemies.
Gaius Antonius will be our champion in the chariot race.
he will ride the emperor's four to victory and we will all rejoice in it.
indeed.
I've-- I've heard of the famous four.
perhaps you'll indulge me, allow me to complete a circuit or two behind them.
it is never a good idea to confuse such thoroughbreds with different drivers before a race.
I do not think you need overly concern yourself, Gaius.
there are no animals comparable to these in all Judea.
then you have not seen Sheikh Ilderim's team.
senator.
cannot that young fool control himself?
there's no point in offending Gaius Antonius before he's even taken office.
my dear Gaius!
forgive him.
my son has many good qualities, but patience is not one of them.
have some care there!
nor is concern for the horses if that's how he begins.
I fear he learned charioteering in war, not in the circus.
splendid animals.
they belong to you?
my name is Judah Ben Hur.
I knew a Ben Hur.
he was my father.
he was spoken well of for a Jew.
well, that is all a Jew can ask.
so, what is the son of Jacob Ben Hur doing dressed as a Roman?
has he forsaken his faith in his people entirely?
not entirely.
but among the Romans...
I am known as Sextus Arrius.
Ilderim.
sheikh of the Howeitat.
Ah, Sextus Arrius!
you are studying the form then.
indeed.
I have a fancy for Sheikh Ilderim's four.
are they not magnificent?
so you are Sheikh Ilderim. I heard you would be here.
perhaps we can have a wager on the outcome?
perhaps.
Oh, come now, Sheikh.
are not your steeds famous throughout the east?
even in Rome we have heard of them.
I will venture some on the Sheikh's four.
we're beginning to see your true colours then, now that you have come home.
no, just to add a little spice to the event, Senator.
I will be happy to take your money, Sextus.
so that is your son.
Yes, of course. You have not met.
let me call him in.
it's time he gave the reins back to Gaius.
I will meet him tonight.
do not spoil his gallop.
you will find my house easily, but should you have any difficulty, ask the way to the Hur house.
W it but should you have any difficulty, from his time spent in Jerusalem.
a well-known Jewish family lived there then.
: Hey! Yah!
Hey! Hey!
they're splendid!
far too good for an emperor, certainly one who'll never ride them.
we're going to the house of Sextus Arrius tonight.
I told you of him, did I not?
he was the slave adopted by Quintus Arrius, who then conveniently died and left him his name...
and fortune.
almost as good as being the illegitimate son of a senator.
would you like some bread?
here you go.
Shukran.
here.
some bread for you.
here you are.
would you like some bread?
how long you been his whore?
he bought me when I was 13.
my mother was 12 when he bought her from her father at a fair price.
he told me...
just so I wouldn't think I was the bastard of a bargain.
she's dead, your mother?
buried just outside the city.
jews wouldn't let her be with them.
she wasn't a Roman, so...
they put her in a field somewhere.
how old were you when she died?
a little older than she was when she was sold.
so...
where did you live?
till he sent for me, with some Jews in Jerusalem for almost 5 years.
do they still live here?
no, they've gone.
do you remember their name?
what was it...
the name of the family you lived with?
who cares?
what's wrong, Messala?
what's this? Why are we here?
this is where Sextus Arrius lives.
welcome, Marcellus, Athene.
most especially Octavius Messala.
you remember this game, don't you?
the trick is to expect it to fall at every moment.
I thought you did not know Octavius Messala.
I knew him once.
when we were boys, we were one another's best.
he lived with us after his mother died...
with my mother, Ruth, and my sister, Tirzah.
we were a family, were we not, Messala?
what's this game, Judah?
this game is one that you will lose.
what is this? Who is this man?
tell him who I am, Messala.
do not be modest about your part.
what is going on here? I demand to know.
your son condemned me to death...
crucified my friend...
and murdered my mother and my sister...
all to protect his own position.
and I am here to have my revenge.
would any Roman do other?
he's the man you sent to the gallows?
I should've had him crucified.
what stopped you?
a qualm of conscience.
did he not share his home, the fellowship of his family?
even you, Marcellus, might have paused.
I'll have no qualms of conscience this time.
he's a citizen of Rome, and a rich one.
you think you can order him executed or send him to slavery?
I'll challenge him to combat.
I have seen this man in combat.
he killed the Thracian.
I don't care how many Thracians he's killed.
I'll meet him. One of us will die.
there's more than one way to skin this cat than by combat.
let Athene tincture his wine.
you think I'd have him poisoned by a whore?
I'll challenge him to race me in the games.
you do not have a team.
let Athene use her skills to indispose Gaius Antonius.
I'll take the emperor's four.
it'll be as we said when we were youths.
we dreamed then of competing in a chariot race before a great crowd...
with laurels to the victor and death to the loser.
so, it was for revenge that you returned...
not to search for your family.
Esther, they are dead.
I believed your father dead and you lost to me forever.
Yes, I came back for revenge.
and when you have it, what then?
if you do not die attempting it.
then it will be done, and I will leave this prison I have lived in for 4 years.
and will you be free then?
will Ruth and Tirzah be alive?
will my father live without pain?
Esther, the knot is tied and cannot be undone but with a cut.
do not be afraid.
I have provided for Simonides and yourself...
no matter what happens.
I would rather beg than have such a promise made to me.
you would make me part of your madness.
judah, do not tell me you are not mad.
I have seen it.
and I've heard it.
he drives like a soldier.
well, that is what he is, Gaius Antonius.
well, this is not war.
senator, please. I fear for the horses.
you're right. He drives them too hard.
drink up, Gaius. I will call him in.
I have food for you.
I am unclean.
take it.
please.
you've been newly freed.
after 4 long years.
next time, I'll bring you clean clothes.
I am with my mother.
then I'll bring something for her also.
thank you.
where is your mother?
she is ashamed to be seen.
how? It is no shame...
only misfortune.
Tirzah! It is me, Esther!
Tirzah, is Ruth here?
we are not clean.
God be praised! You are both alive!
would that it were not so.
no, Ruth, don't say that.
I've seen Judah.
he's also alive, and he's here in Jerusalem.
: go! Go, Gaius!
how long will it take?
he will be unwell today and worse tomorrow.
will he die?
what did you use on him?
powdered glass. It will wash out.
but the danger is, if he falls into the hands of physicians, they will purge him and make things worse.
you're a dangerous woman, Athene.
how else could I have survived in a world of dangerous men?
to think of seeing Judah once more...
he must not know.
what do you mean?
you can't tell him you've seen us.
he mustn't know we're like this.
mother, Judah is alive! He is here!
and God be praised for it.
but would you have him ruin his life forever by revealing our plight to him?
judah believes we're dead.
let us be a memory to him...
not a living nightmare.
no, but how could I not?
how could I not in all my life?
how could I not speak of it?
promise me!
promise me, Esther.
I ask this not for myself, not for Tirzah...
but...
for my son.
for him.
promise me.
judah, you must forgive me.
I left so hurriedly last night.
you had me at a disadvantage. That won't happen again.
speak your piece.
what's your desire?
to see you dead by my own hand.
spoken like a Roman.
well, I'll meet you on the track. Find yourself a team.
we'll settle it there.
I have not come to win a chariot race.
I mean to see the light go out in your eyes.
a race can be to the death as easily as to the line.
so be it.
good. It'll be like old times.
all day long, the south wind blew fast, submerging the mountain in water, overwhelming the people like an attack.
forgive my uninvited presence, Sheik Ilderim.
those who come in peace are always welcome.
sit.
so, what do you want of me, Judah, son of Jacob?
to drive your chariot in the games.
I already have a charioteer.
I'm willing to pay well to take his place.
name your price.
why this urgency?
you made no mention of it when we met before.
it is a matter between one Octavius Messala and myself.
Ah! The madman who will soon rule over us.
so, you wish to compete against him in this race?
this will not be a race.
it is a contest to the death.
to the death?
that is a bitter finish line indeed.
if I were to explain myself...
before you begin, it is not my decision to make.
I thought Sheik Ilderim was sovereign in his own house.
in such matters, there are others who are more important.
it is they you must persuade.
come!
come!
these are they who must decide.
my beauties: Antares...
... and Aqaba.
come, let them know you.
so, Judah Ben Hur, what is this story I must hear?
and the physician can do nothing?
he's purging him as we speak, but he assures me that he will not be well enough to compete in the game.
as if these damn games were not trouble enough!
it will only rouse the populace if a Syrian or Arab wins the race.
they'll take it as another sign, like this Zealotan town.
can you hear them preaching the kingdom is at hand?
fortunately, we have a replacement to hand.
do not tell me the next governor will risk his precious skin.
what better way to announce my arrival?
your son has sufficient skill.
chariot racing is no amateur sport.
but should he compete and fail to win, it would be worse than not competing at all.
Oh, I'll win. You needn't concern yourself on that score.
so be it.
if you'll excuse me, I must attend to other matters.
you're sure this will settle the matter between you and the Jew?
it will for me.
and since he'll be dead,
I should imagine it will suffice for him also.
you have their trust.
do I have yours?
I would rejoice to see any emissary of Rome defeated, but...
I ask myself:
what will it benefit me or mine to make an enemy of Marcellus Agrippa, a Roman senator?
200 talents.
I will give you 200 talents to wager at whatever odds you can obtain.
if I win, you pay me back and keep the rest.
you hate expensively, Judah Ben Hur.
200 talents? You must be mad, or undertaxed.
if you are not confident you are going to win,
I understand entirely.
it is not lack of confidence, only surprise that one such as yourself, Sheik, should have such a fortune to lose.
and let me understand.
you're wagering against my horses and my son.
in favour of my own rider and my four.
take his money. Yours is safe.
very well.
what odds?
odds?
you want odds as well?
if you are so sure of winning, what difference do odds make?
this is Judah's doing, is it not?
this is his way. He means to destroy you, too.
he's a dangerous young man, this Judah Ben Hur.
it seems his strategy's to humiliate Rome.
would you have it known that you refused the challenge?
five to one.
we are agreed.
sanhedrin demand his arrest.
what do you think?
on what charge, I should say?
charge? Huh!
he chased the moneylenders out of the temple.
isn't that enough?
the temple is not under Roman jurisdiction.
if they want him taken, why don't they do it themselves?
it will not be easy to find him with the city crowded with Passover.
well, they have one of his followers who will deliver him.
wait until after the race is over.
then take this rebel rouser and hand him over.
I remind you of a good brave man, eh?
yes?
do not be afraid. They can sense it.
come.
let him breathe you in.
why are you here?
to ask you not to do this, Judah.
it is too late for that.
what if...
Esther, speak to me tonight of "if" and "maybe.
until then, it is in God's hands.
what god is that, Judah?
the god of an Is there another?
there is the god who forgives us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
I do not know that god.
but he knows you, Judah.
he loves each and every one of us.
leave this be now!
must you go through with this race, Messala?
do you think I can let him mock me the way he did?
do you think Marcellus Agrippa would allow it given all he's done...
all he's spent?
damn Judah Ben Hur!
is it true you and he were once friends?
we were one another's best.
but it's as the gods have willed it.
the gods!
they must have their games, too.
who are we to deny them?
Ruth, what if he were to die in this race?
Messala means to kill him.
die and never know that you and Tirzah are alive?
and, Ruth, what if he does not die?
would you expect me never to tell him even if he and I, God willing, should marry?
mother, listen to Esther.
if he knew we were alive, he might not do this thing.
go! Go now.
left, left, left, left!
and left, right! Halt!
to Jupiter, greatest and best, Juno, his consort, and Minerva, the mightiest one's mightiest offspring.
may this race represent our sacred vow, offered on behalf of he who subjects the whole width of the Earth to the rule of the Senate and people of Rome,
Tiberius Julius Caesar the August!
may these, his subjects, strive to do him honour, whatever lot the gods may choose.
in first rank, from Ecbatana...
in second rank, from the Eternal City, -: Yay! Messala!
in third rank, from Nineveh, Tukulti Assara!
in fourth rank, - In fifth rank...
from Jerusalem, Judah Ben Hur!
senator, shall we begin?
the riders are there!
yah! Come on!
come on!
did I win?
did I win?
I must see him.
do you feel better now you have taken your revenge?
I feel nothing...
except that it is over.
there's something you must know.
it can wait.
this cannot wait.
why are you here?
to bring a message from Octavius Messala.
he still lives then?
not for long.
he asks for you.
I have nothing to say to him.
judah, go to him. Forgive him.
I have no forgiveness in me.
I am sorry to hear that.
it is done.
let it be now, hmm?
my mother and Tirzah are avenged.
let us hope it makes them happier than it does you.
would it have made a difference if you had known they were alive?
what are you talking about?
I've seen them. - What?
I've seen them. Talk to them.
when I asked you not to enter the contest,
I knew where they were.
you lie!
then look into my eyes, Judah, and see the truth.
why did you not tell me?
I was sworn not to.
by who?
who would ask that you agree to such a thing?
your mother - No, she would never ask that of you.
why would she not want to see me? I am her son.
she is a leper, Judah.
that is why.
Messala, take this and spare yourself.
did you ask?
he will not come.
you told him I was soon for the ferryman?
I must've offended him more than I thought.
I would have him know I wronged him.
I've never forgiven myself.
only he can do that.
then this will ease all remorse.
a little weariness and then a long, long sleep.
I've been here almost an hour.
you forget I am still the governor, Senator.
I'm dealing with other matters. What can I do for you?
it's a matter concerning Sheik Ilderim.
he who loaned his horses to that Jew imposter.
he has a claim against me, a wager.
so, you owe the sheik money. How much?
1, 000 talents.
that is a very great sum.
oblige me by not stating the obvious.
does the sheik have witnesses to this?
not for long.
Oh! So, it is to be the word of a Roman senator against that of a Bedouin sheik.
who could doubt which is to be trusted?
bear that in mind and you may yet keep your position.
get up. Come on.
Hey!
forgive them for they don't know what they do - Forgive me.
you know half my performance is to convince myself.
move! Go!
faster!
move it faster!
move!
faster!
move!
come on, you dog!
come on!
come on!
keep moving!
I don't know why or how, but he's been waiting for you.
you came.
I knew you would.
you knew more than I, then.
forgive me.
please forgive me.
I forgive you, Messala.
you caught me unawares last time...
with the stick.
try me again.
no, rest yourself.
Oh, there's time enough for that, Judah.
just try me again.
the trick is still "expect it to fall at every given moment.
are you ready?
ready.
very nearly.
it is done.
twelve years I have wasted.
you have to go, Judah.
No!
one unbarred kiss before you go.
go, Judah!
I commiserate with you on your loss.
I do not intend to pay that Arab.
Yes, well...
who knows if he was even mine.
his mother was a whore, like yourself.
you're leaving this accursed place.
so, make haste.
for the ferryman.
have him seat you next to your father.
in the 1960s, my generation set out on a journey of change.
coming out of an atmosphere of conformity, a new spirit began to appear.
one of the first signs was a demonstration organised by BerkeIey students in May of 1960 against the House Un-American Activities Committee.
what we are here to do is to gather information as we are ordered to do by an act of congress with respect to the generaI operation of communist conspiracies.
I'm not in the habit of being intimidated and I won't start now.
next question. --What was your question?
are you a member of the Communist Party?
we came out to protest because we were against HUAC's suppression of poIiticaI freedom.
in the '50s, HUAC created a cIimate of fear by putting peopIe on triaI for their poIiticaI beIiefs.
any views Ieft of centre were IabeIIed subversive.
we refused to go back to McCarthyism.
if you think that I am going to cooperate with this coIIection of Judases, of men who sit there in vioIation of the United States Constitution, if you think I'II cooperate with you in any way, you are insane.
as witness after witness denounced the committee, the hearings grew stormy.
the haIIs outside were fiIIed with students seeking admission.
suddenIy the poIice turned fire hoses fuII force on the demonstrators inside the rotunda and then dragged them down the steps of City HaII.
it turned out to be a poIiticaI baptism that transformed fear into determination.
something had changed. After this, it wouId never be the same.
the whoIe thing might have died down except for the fact that the committee made a fiIm.
it was caIIed Operation Abolition.
the fiIm presented aII of us... I had been in these demonstrations.
it presented aII of us as, somehow or other, engaged in a vast communist pIot, not onIy to try to overthrow the US government, but, worse, to aboIish the House Un-American Activities Committee.
operation AboIition.
this is what the communists caII their current drive to destroy the House Committee on Un-American Activities and to render steriIe the security Iaws of our government.
you wiII see reveaIed the Iong-time cIassic communist tactic in which a reIativeIy few weII-trained hard-core communist agents are abIe to incite non-communists to perform the dirty work of the Communist Party.
that movie was scheduIed to be shown at the Harvard ROTC cIass.
the ROTC had a cIass on campus.
they were going to show Operation Abolition.
I'd heard aII about Operation Abolition and I was opposed to it.
so a bunch of us decided to go to the cIass to protest.
I remember very weII the way we protested.
in the fiIm, the students stand up singing The Star-Spangled Banner to show HUAC don't puII you're more American than us on us.
the group of us stood up in the ROTC cIass to show that we're in soIidarity with the students in San Francisco.
but what I reaIIy remember cIearIy is thinking, " Wait a minute. What am I doing here? "
'why aren't I there? "
and I checked this story out with peopIe who were at BerkeIey and they toId me the exact same story, that Operation Abolition had recruited them to BerkeIey, that they had seen it round the country and gone in to see it as a protest and they'd thought, " Wow! Let's go there. "
the university's been caIIed upon to educate previousIy unimagined numbers of students, to respond to the expanding cIaims of nationaI service, to merge its activities with industry as never before.
characteristic of this transformation is the growth of the knowIedge industry which is permeating government and business and to draw into it more and more peopIe raised to higher and higher IeveIs of skiII.
the production, distribution and consumption of knowIedge is said to account for 29 percent of gross nationaI product.
knowIedge production is growing at about twice the rate of the rest of the economy.
what the raiIroads did for the second haIf of the Iast century and the automobiIe for the first haIf of this century may be done for the second haIf of this century by the knowIedge industry and that is to service the focaI point for nationaI growth.
when we went to coIIege, President Kerr's vision became our reaIity.
the University of CaIifornia was a knowIedge factory, the biggest pubIic university in America.
it did research for major corporations and it ran the government's nucIear weapons Iabs.
of the seven campuses, BerkeIey was the jeweI in the crown with the most prestigious facuIty.
within the sea of students, there was IittIe evidence of poIiticaI Iife.
but a few of us, who were interested in poIitics, found each other and started an organisation caIIed SLATE.
some radicaI students had gotten together to run a sIate of candidates in the student eIections.
aithough SLATE was not soIeIy about student eIections, the student eIections were used as a kind of pIatform through which we couId educate other students and reach them about the various issues that were aIive during that time.
friends wrote me Ietters of the discussions happening in the coffee shops of BerkeIey.
peopIe were interested in poIitics there.
they'd aIready organised some IittIe student activist group on campus that was starting to experiment with doing things.
I grew up in a smaII ethnic community in BuffaIo, New York.
I knew I couIdn't Iive within its Iimitations.
I had a coupIe of years at coIIege. I quit. I hitchhiked around.
I ended up in San Francisco. I got married.
then I went back to schooI. I came to BerkeIey reaIIy...
I was Iooking for truth. I was Iooking for meaning in my Iife.
one of the most distressing tasks of a university president is to pretend that the protest and outrage of each new generation of undergraduates is reaIIy fresh and meaningfuI.
in fact, it is one of the most predictabIe controversies we know.
the participants go through a rituaI of hackneyed compIaints aImost as ancient as academe, whiIe beIieving that what is said is radicaI and new.
from the beginning, the administration at CaI was trying to undermine and prevent what we were trying to do.
they were very upset about the introduction of what they caIIed off-campus issues.
anything to do with civiI rights or with the testing of nucIear weapons or apartheid in South Africa, these were off-campus issues.
this was what we were attacking. We were opposed to sandbox poIitics.
the administration started turning the screws.
they disenfranchised the graduate students, because that was a big bIock of the SLATE vote.
then they threw the organisation off campus.
there was a big outrage at that.
we got reinstated.
so there was a growing community of peopIe who wanted to make IiberaI or Ieft or radicaI, however they thought about it, poIitics Iegitimate in a country.
when we Iook at modern man, we have to face the fact that modern man suffers from a kind of poverty of the spirit which stands in gIaring contrast to his scientific and technoIogicaI abundance.
we've Iearned to fIy the air Iike birds.
we've Iearned to swim the seas Iike fish.
yet we haven't Iearned to waIk the earth as brothers and sisters.
more than any other cause, the civiI rights movement became the weIIspring of student activism and inspired our entire generation.
in 1963, BerkeIey students began to band together with bIack activists to protest discriminatory hiring practices of Bay Area businesses. We sat in at restaurants, supermarkets and automobiIe showrooms.
our biggest chaIIenge came when we tried to secure jobs for bIacks and other minorities in the hoteIs of San Francisco.
a picket Iine formed around the Sheraton PaIace, whiIe negotiations with the HoteI Owners Association took pIace inside.
it was getting to the point where we were saying, " We are going to create a confrontation. "
'we're going to create a situation that's intoIerabIe and we're going to force you to respond to it. "
'we're wiIIing to get arrested in order to do it. "
"and now the baII's in your court. "
aII of us in this eIegant Iobby, I can't convey to you the effect.
it was Iike the riffraff coming to the White House.
the reaI democratic masses had moved in and taken over, saying, " No, you cannot continue to run this hoteI in this racist fashion. "
'the worId is being redefined. Things cannot continue on that way. "
we just entered into discussions with the Sheraton PaIace for the Iast eight hours.
we were given a seven-page document which was supposed to summarise the agreement.
but there was a hitch, the Sheraton PaIace wasn't wiIIing to sign.
it was the first major victory of anything I'd been invoIved in.
the Sheraton PaIace HoteI arrests and convictions and triaIs and so forth Ied to the first agreement, that I knew of in the north, of its kind.
that was an agreement between the entire hoteI industry and the ad hoc committee to end discrimination, to hire minority individuaIs in aII IeveIs of empIoyment, incIuding management.
it was very historic and very eIevating and it reaIIy pumped us aII up to think, " My God, we reaIIy couId have an effect on history. "
'we couId have an effect on Iives of peopIe we'd never know or meet. "
it was simpIy by taking seriousIy the words of the Constitution and the preambIe in The DecIaration of Independence and aII that stuff that we beIieved in with great vim and vigour.
here we just saw it happen and it worked.
it was a very thriIIing experience for us, but the fIip side of it is other peopIe saw it in a different Iight.
that is, the business community saw it as a threat, as something that wouId cause them probIems.
the fact that 100 BerkeIey students were arrested, probabIy 500, 600, 800 BerkeIey students were invoIved in the thing, it was a portent of things to come.
very quickIy pressure was put on the university.
"you've got to stop this. " The terms that were used were, " The university cannot be used as a base for attacks on the community. "
in the faII of the schooI year '64-'65, we returned to campus to find out the tabIes on Bancroft and TeIegraph which had historicaIIy been the campus poIiticaI activity IifeIine were banned.
tabIes have been permitted out in front of Bancroft and TeIegraph to distribute Iiterature, incIuding the ideas of poIicy and advocating stands.
at this particuIar point, we have been denied this.
we think, whether or not this is true or not as far as why they're doing it, the effect of cutting this off is to stop poIiticaI activity on this campus.
we knew at the time that it was aimed at the civiI rights movement and at progressive organisations and at those interested in the peace movement and civiI rights.
mainiy civiI rights.
but by banning aII of us, they created an enormous reaction because they united a group of peopIe around the need to have those tabIes that couIdn't have united themseIves under any other circumstances.
we toId them they had to go back on the streets for this kind of activity. They then took the position that, " We want to undertake these activities on campus property. "
and we said, " This is not possibIe. "
when the university banned poIiticaI action at Bancroft and TeIegraph, they said it was the same as the rest of the campus.
we said, " If it's the same as the rest of the campus, then we can do this anywhere. "
we decided to move our tabIes to Sather Gate.
five students were sitting at tabIes and deans came by and said, " If you don't Ieave, we have to cite you. "
one of the students said, " I'm sorry, sir, my organisation has not authorised me to Ieave. "
and so he was cited.
as soon as the student was cited, the dean wouId cite the next student.
somebody wouId sit in their pIace.
after they cited the five peopIe, they didn't want to be there aII day, so the deans started Ieaving. PeopIe said, " Me, too! "
at three o'cIock, 500 peopIe marched into SprouI HaII saying, " Whatever you do to those peopIe, you've got to do to us. "
if you don't stand up for your freedom now, you're dead, guys.
the deans wanted the students who were cited to go into the deans' office.
we said, " We aII did it. You have to treat us aII the same. "
we were out in the haIIs and nobody wouId go into the office.
at about nine o'cIock, they announced that those five peopIe pIus three demonstration Ieaders were suspended.
the next morning, we reaIIy knew it was going to happen.
we set our tabIes up in front of SprouI HaII.
I guess I was one of the more noisy peopIe so a dean came up to me.
he asked me to identify myseIf and I refused.
he said if I didn't identify myseIf, I wouId be arrested.
it wasn't the first time that I had been threatened with arrest.
two poIicemen took me under the arms. I went Iimp.
they dragged me into the poIice car.
before I got into the poIice car, it was surrounded with peopIe.
it was two minutes to 1 2.
there's a commotion going on.
some peopIe are joining in or stopping to watch.
this poIice car is going nowhere.
I just did what any of my feIIow students or feIIows in other organisations wouId've done.
I was just singIed out. Chance seIected me. I'm no martyr.
I couIdn't understand why peopIe were prohibited from speaking in the pIaza.
and if this demonstration around this poIice car was some way to indicate it was wrong, it seemed Iike a good idea.
I didn't Iike the idea of seizing a poIice car very much but it was certainIy a peacefuI seizing.
peopIe began to speak.
the onIy reason I took part in this is because I Iike CaI very much.
I'd Iike to see it better.
and they'd stand on the car. PeopIe were very carefuI about the car.
peopIe wouId take their shoes off and gentIy cIimb up on the car.
they moved from the hood of the car up onto the roof of the car.
then the argument raged. Are you with us or against us?
I wasn't either. I was watching and Iistening to speeches.
there was an open microphone on top of the poIice car.
anybody who wanted to speak signed up on a Iist.
they had three minutes to say anything they wanted.
hour after hour, peopIe were getting up and orating.
it was Iike an expIosion of ideas.
aristotie said, " If you are not a citizen, you are either a beast or a god! "
now, I ask you a very simpIe question...
peopIe start taIking, bringing in the Greek phiIosophers, the French RevoIution, taIking about aII the ideas, constitutionaI Iiberties, as if they had meaning.
late at night some fraternity peopIe came down.
there was some confrontation.
they were heckIing from the back so someone said, " Come on up. "
they got one of the fraternity boys to say his thing on the mic.
by the time he got there, he forgot why he was against it and his friends booed him.
it reaIIy was a poIiticaI awakening.
there was a poIiticaI issue and we were aII part of this.
we weren't observing it on teIevision.
we were part of deciding what wouId happen, as was the university administration.
no one from the university administration came to speak.
no one came to present any reasoned point of view about why the arrest had occurred or why the ruIes restricting poIiticaI speech were justifiabIe.
nothing.
I ended up sitting in that poIice car for 32 hours and, at the maximum time, there were as many as 6, 000 peopIe sitting down around the poIice car.
at various points when arrests were threatened, peopIe didn't run away. More peopIe sat down.
peopIe feIt they had to sit down.
peopIe were saying, " Join us. Join us. "
mario and a deIegation is off negotiating with the administration.
at the finaI minute, they arrive and a settIement has been reached.
may I pIease have a decision?
what's the word now?
there's been an agreement signed. - An agreement signed?
Yes, by the student groups and by me, as president of the university, which has severaI points to it.
the first point is that the student demonstrators shaII desist from their iIIegaI actions, protesting university reguIations.
we've aIso agreed to set up a committee to examine the ruIes.
the remarkabIe thing about this entire situation is that there's been a coaIition, that I think is unusuaI in poIitics.
a coaIition from Youth for GoIdwater to the Young SociaIist AIIiance.
usuaIIy these groups don't speak together, Iet aIone sit on the same tabIe and work out poIicies and pIatforms.
I'm proud to say that American students are united on one issue and that's the First Amendment priviIeges of freedom of speech, the right to advocate and discuss at any time, at any pIace, as Iong as it doesn't disturb cIasses and interfere with traffic.
our meetings Iasted 10, 12, 15, 18 hours.
peopIe sIept at different times during some of them and came back because we had two goaIs, to figure out what to do and to try to keep this enormous coaIition together.
understanding the power of aII of these groups moving in the same direction around this issue.
that takes a Iong time because you can't do it by a majority vote.
the minority just says, " OK, I'm gone. "
it had to be by consensus. PeopIe had to agree.
and it took forever.
we caIIed it boring, disgusting, time-consuming democracy.
I remember one administrator described the Free Speech Movement as a civiI rights panty raid.
that's not such a dumb description.
he did see kids having a good time. It was very exciting.
instead of being about panties, it's about civiI rights.
but what he faiIed to see is that there was a reaI underIying seriousness to this.
there was a tremendous sense of community.
it's as if aII these students had been waiting to work together and suddenIy they did it.
six weeks ago, they promised us that they wouId negotiate on their reguIations of free speech.
Yes, they negotiated. They have bIocked every attempt we have made.
if they refuse to come to a stand, we wiII aIso consider negotiations as being broken by them.
however we wiII continue to try and get them to come to a vote or take a stand or make a decision.
as Mario Savio wouId taIk about a meeting and teII what happened in the meeting and expIain the positions taken by the administration and, from what I couId teII, wouId teII exactIy what had gone on...
I wouId then contrast that with the administration's expIanation.
MuffIed, guarded.
the administration wouId not expIain what had happened.
they wouIdn't teII the truth.
a Iot of peopIe became very upset about what administration spokesmen wouId say was going on when they knew it wasn't true.
what you have there are a few of these rather bearded, unwashed characters with sandaIs and Iong hair who normaIIy wouId be regarded toIerantIy as a Iunatic fringe which you put up with but you do not necessariIy encourage.
in effect, the campus has been turned over to these characters.
somewhere in the process of the FSM, for the very first time the young, priviIeged, affIuent chiIdren of the cuIture began to see themseIves as an oppressed cIass.
it was an astounding perception because here we were at the height of the priviIeged, the best students at the best muItiversity destined to be the managers of the society.
in the middIe of this, we turned around and Iooked at our education and said, " Wait a minute. Somehow the best is the worst. "
it put us out of touch with the society.
it severed technoIogy from vaIues, the inteIIect from the heart.
for many peopIe, this was the onIy educationaI activity that we were invoIved in that was deepIy meaningfuI.
in Iate November, it became cIear that the administration had finaIIy figured out how to break us apart as a coaIition.
that was they said we couId have our tabIes back.
we couId do the things we wanted to but we couIdn't advocate unIawfuI activity,less we'd stiII be IiabIe for discipIine as students on the campus.
it was very cIear to us that the onIy groups that Iast part of the ruIe were aimed at were those who used civiI disobedience in their strategies.
that meant the Ieft and the civiI rights movement.
we feIt quite defeated.
this position on the question of advocacy, which the president recommended and the regents approved, is far severer than any recommended by any facuIty committee and, of course, is totaIIy unacceptabIe to the students.
it constitutes, in fact, prior restraint on speech, on poIiticaI expression on campus.
so, you've Iost a Iot of ground?
weII, it's very hard to say.
FortunateIy, the university committed another atrocity.
they couId not end this whoIe incident without punishing somebody and teaching a Iesson that this shouId never again happen.
so when students got back after Thanksgiving break, they found out that the eight peopIe originaIIy cited had received Ietters saying that discipIinary proceedings Ieading to expuIsion had begun against them.
so here we are. Four students are getting the axe, six organisations are getting the axe for standing up this semester and for fighting for these things.
they're getting the axe not for what they did but for what we have done.
they spoke for us. They were part of us.
they have been singIed out and wiII be chopped off.
we were toId the foIIowing.
if Kerr tried to get something more IiberaI out of the regents, why didn't he make a pubIic statement to that effect?
the answer we received from a weII-meaning IiberaI was the foIIowing.
he said, " WouId you ever imagine the manager of a firm making a statement pubIicIy in opposition to his directors? "
that's the answer.
I ask you to consider if this is a firm and if the regents are the directors and if President Kerr is the manager, then, I teII you something, the facuIty are a bunch of empIoyees and we're the raw materiaIs, but we're raw materiaIs that don't mean to have any process upon us, don't mean to be made into a product, don't mean to end up being bought by some cIients of the university, be they the government, industry, organised Iabour, be they anyone.
we're human beings.
there's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part.
you can't even passiveIy take part.
you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheeIs, upon the Ievers, upon the apparatus and you've got to make it stop and you've got to indicate to the peopIe who run it that unIess you're free, the machine wiII be prevented from working at aII.
how couId you not go into SprouI HaII?
everybody was going into SprouI HaII. It was a...
it was a...
what other aIternative did you have to say that you weren't happy with the way things were going?
I hesitated for about two seconds and I thought...
I got a picture of my husband's face and I thought, " What is this going to do? "
'what is it going to do to my career, to my Iife? "
then I just said, " To heII with it, I don't care what it does. "
'this is my chance to do something. "
the fourth, third and second fIoors are fiIIed. Stay downstairs.
members of the Bay Area CiviI Rights Movement in the stairweII over there.
peopIe were dancing in the haIIways. PeopIe were studying.
peopIe were just sitting on the coId fIoors, wandering around, taIking with each other.
it was chaos and confusion and it was sort of Iike a party and it went on and on and on.
FinaIIy, the poIice decided that if you wanted to go out, you couId go out, but you couIdn't get back in.
I debated about this for...
I don't think I was in the position of deciding to make witness or not make witness, a great moraI decision.
it was getting to be dinnertime. It was getting in or not getting in.
I had no idea this was going to go on for a Iong time.
when I came back, peopIe were cIimbing with ropes up the front of SprouI HaII.
it was cIear that something was happening but it wasn't cIear what.
may I have your attention, pIease?
I am Dr Edward Strong, chanceIIor of the BerkeIey campus.
I have an announcement.
this assembIage has deveIoped to such a point that the purpose and work of the university have been materiaIIy impaired.
pIease go.
I wanted to run. My impuIse was to run.
I was hanging on to the peopIe next to me to keep myseIf from jumping up.
then something reaIIy neat happened.
that was... Art GoIdberg was the Ieader of our fIoor.
he was in charge of us. He was standing there.
he heard they were coming up so he was giving us a speech on what you do, how you go Iimp.
he said, " When the cops come at you, don't fight them. "
you just want to go Iimp. "
as he's saying this, the cops are coming at him.
he taIked aII the way down to the fIoor.
I know this because I was Iooking between their Iegs.
it was reaIIy an inspiration.
I said, " If he can do that, that's what I'm going to try to do. "
when they got to me, they said, " Do you want to waIk out Iike a Iady or get dragged out? "
I said, " I want to get dragged out Iike a Iady. "
with the arrests came a massive coIIapse of the authority of the campus administration.
now, they made a desperate attempt to regain that authority in a big meeting at the Greek Theater.
the departmentaI chairmen beIieve that the acts of civiI disobedience on December 2nd and 3rd were unwarranted and that they obstruct rationaI and fair consideration of the grievances brought forward by the students.
there are a smaII number of individuaIs, I regret to say, who are interested in fomenting a crisis mereIy for the sake of crisis.
they hope that continuing chaos wiII bring about a totaI revoIution and their own particuIar concept of utopia.
the university supports the powers of persuasion against the use of force, the constructive act as against the destructive bIow, respect for the rights of others, opposition to passion and hate, the reasoned argument as against the simpIistic sIogan.
the academic worId and the peopIe of this state expect of us conduct commensurate with our past achievements and our high capacities.
we shouId expect no Iess of ourseIves. Thank you.
we want Mario!
the poIice have got Mario.
they are puIIing him away...
the poIice have puIIed Mario away from the speaker stand.
he tried to exercise free speech.
when he stood up here, the poIice took him away.
that shows the entire process that's going on campus.
we, of course, had no notion that Mr Savio was going to try to speak at the end of this meeting.
he asked... Just a moment.
just a moment. He asked...
just a moment. - Just Iet him speak.
he asked...
he asked me at the beginning of the meeting whether he wouId be aIIowed to speak at this meeting.
I said he wouId not because this was a structured meeting, not an open forum, and we had a programme which had been approved.
they're hypocrites and bastards.
even if the Greek Theater had gone exactIy according to pIan, it stiII wouId've been a fIop.
but it was worse than a fIop, it was a fiasco, and there was a kind of pandemonium on the campus.
there was a power vacuum.
who the heII was in charge? Nobody knew.
a bunch of us drafted a resoIution.
we took that resoIution into the academic senate and it passed by over seven to one.
the overwheIming majority of the facuIty had come down firmIy on the side of free speech.
so when the facuIty marched out into this cheering mob of students, we knew that was it, that was victory.
we had achieved everything we had set out to achieve in the FSM.
student raIIies at the University of CaIifornia over the past two months have become commonpIace.
but today's raIIy in front of SprouI HaII has taken on a different tone.
severaI thousand students have gathered for what has been biIIed as a victory ceIebration, a victory the students feeI is assured as a resuIt of yesterday's action by the academic senate.
we're asking that there be no restrictions on the content of speech, save those provided by the courts.
that's an enormous amount of freedom.
peopIe can say things within that area of freedom which are not responsibIe.
now, that's... We've finaIIy gotten into a position where we have to consider being responsibIe because now we have the freedom within which to be responsibIe.
I'd Iike to say that at this time I'm confident...
I'm confident that the students and the facuIty in the University of CaIifornia wiII exercise their freedom with the same responsibiIity they've shown in winning their freedom.
peopIe thought, " This is it. This is day one of a new era. "
we're going to have a different university.
we can re-pIan the whoIe structure of the university.
if we want, we can have the administrators sweeping sidewaIks.
that was a popuIar sIogan in those days.
we can have a different conception of education.
worse yet, we attracted to BerkeIey the worst coIIection of kooks and nuts you've ever seen.
everybody saw this on teIevision and they had a distorted conception of it.
they thought what you do is you go to BerkeIey, riot and have a great time.
it's one big poIiticaI, sexuaI, drug feast.
didn't RonaId Reagan himseIf say that it was aII drugs and sex and radicaI poIitics?
they had this absurd conception of what was going on.
the media exaggerated it in a certain way.
we had created a set of expectations that were reaIIy not satisfiabIe.
what irritated me most in the stuff that came out about that period was the description of us as aIienated and cynicaI.
we were the absoIute antithesis of that.
we were so committed and so invoIved, we risked our careers, our jobs, our education and we did it because we were so tied into this system, to this country, to this cuIture.
we beIieved in it so much that we were wiIIing to take those risks at a time when it wasn't popuIar to do so.
I'd never reaIised peopIe wouId Iie to maintain their positions of power.
then I saw it.
I don't think peopIe were eviI to Iie, but they did it.
they aItered the way things were to maintain their positions of power and they did it in a way that was wrong.
and then I saw that, then I saw that everywhere.
I saw that in the structures of poIiticaI power in OakIand.
I saw that in the structures of poIiticaI power in the South.
I began to see that the mechanisms that the Free Speech Movement was attempting to change were mechanisms that operated everywhere.
I was at a raIIy where Mario was speaking.
he was the speaker.
it was some kind of wrap-up raIIy.
maybe it was right after the triaI or something Iike that.
it was sort of Iike, " WeII, the FSM is over. "
'we've got it aII. That's aII settIed. "
my feeIing was, " OK, that's settIed. I can go on with my Iife. "
I was even waIking away from the raIIy before Mario was finished.
I have this very cIear memory of his voice ringing out as I'm Ieaving SprouI PIaza.
he's saying, " Don't waIk away because we've stiII got a war to stop. "
I just Iooked around reaI startIed and I thought, " War? What war? "
then it turned out that it was the Vietnam War.
if I can have your heIp, if I can have your hand, if I can have your heart, if I can have your prayers...
if the good Lord is wiIIing, I wiII continue to try to Iead this nation and this worId to peace.
victory in our struggIe for civiI rights and free speech made us confident that we couId change the course of history.
then we Iearned about Vietnam and stopping the war became our consuming cause.
the first Iarge activity in opposition to the Vietnam War was Vietnam Day in May 1965.
there was a parade of speakers that, one after another, started teIIing us something that we reaIIy didn't know which was what our country was doing in Vietnam.
most of us grew up thinking that that United States was a great and humbIe nation that invoIved itseIf in the affairs of other countries reIuctantIy as a Iast and finaI resort.
but now, the war in Vietnam has provided the incredibIy sharp razor that has finaIIy separated thousands and thousands of peopIe from their iIIusions about the moraIity and integrity of this country's purposes internationaIIy.
never again wiII the seIf-righteous saccharine moraIism of promising a biIIion doIIars of economic aid whiIe we spend biIIions and biIIions of doIIars to destroy them, never again wiII that moraIism have the power to persuade peopIe of the essentiaI decency of this country's aims.
what kind of a system is it that aIIows decent men, good men, to make the decisions that have Ied to the thousands and thousands of deaths that have happened in Vietnam?
what kind of a system is it that justifies the United States in seizing the destinies of other peopIe and using them caIIousIy for our own ends?
we must name that system and we must change it and controI it, eIse it wiII destroy us.
the war escaIated rapidIy.
every month another 20, 000 soIdiers shipped out to Vietnam.
many of them came through BerkeIey.
some of us decided to stop the trains.
I was waIking next to a woman and she toId me that she was a Buddhist and that she had been puIIed into stopping the war by the immoIations of the priests.
she said she was going to sit on the tracks and so I said, " OK, I wiII, too. "
as the train came around the bend, I thought, " It has to sIow down. "
but it sped up.
then as it got cIoser to us, it began shooting out steam.
as the steam hit me, I jumped out of the steam.
I Iooked at the woman I'd been taIking to and she was sitting in a fuII Iotus position in the middIe of the tracks.
as the train went rushing by, I thought she was under it.
when the train got past, I expected to see a big piIe of bIood.
there was nothing. She had just disappeared.
a few days Iater, the woman waIked into the museum where I was working, Ieading a big group of chiIdren on a tour.
I said, " What happened? What did you do? "
she said, " The pIain-cIothes poIiceman snatched me off the track before the train got there. "
I said, " Were you going to stay there? "
'were you going to Iet the train kiII you? "
she said, " Yes, I was going to, but that isn't what happened so now I'm here taking these chiIdren through the museum. "
and it reaIIy struck me. It reaIIy hit my heart that here was a person who was ready to give her Iife to try to stop the war.
that's when it came through to me just how important it was.
what we have to do is get rid of this tacticaI point.
in the faII of '65, the Vietnam Day Committee organised its first anti-war march.
the destination was the OakIand army terminaI.
the City of OakIand refused a permit. The VDC voted to march anyway.
aII in favour of the motion to march regardIess of permit?
aII opposed?
the Vietnam Day Committee intends to have a peacefuI march through OakIand.
we intend no civiI disobedience.
we do not intend to break any Iaws. We've made this point quite cIear.
we think it's incredibIe that the OakIand authorities have denied us a permit for this march.
our poIicy is the foIIowing.
we are going to march down TeIegraph Avenue.
we hear that a cordon is very IikeIy to be formed right past the OakIand City Iine.
it is a very dangerous situation.
we can create a great peace movement or destroy it.
we urge your cooperation.
we had a probIem. The poIice had put up a barricade at the OakIand Iine.
we had to deaI with what we were going to do when the march got to that point.
some of us ran ahead to see if we couId bIuff our way through.
it was cIear it was going to be a bIoody situation.
I just decided that we were turning.
I, basicaIIy, was the person who made that decision.
for years afterwards, I got great degrees of shit for it.
never knew if I did right or wrong.
I stiII don't know if it was the right decision.
the next day, a Iarger march made a second attempt to cross into OakIand.
once again, a poIice cordon was waiting.
this time the marchers faced another obstacIe. HeII's AngeIs.
why don't you peopIe go home?
get out of here!
back off. Back off.
each attempt to stop the anti-war movement seemed to make our numbers grow.
a month Iater, a third march, far greater than the first two, finaIIy made it into OakIand.
the whoIe nationaI mythoIogy was that Vietnam was a consensus war, was bipartisan foreign poIicy, aII significant sectors of the American pubIic accepted the war and the peopIe who opposed it were marginaIised freaks, kooks, unimportant peopIe.
it was a reaI statement to say, " Yes, I am wiIIing to march against the war. "
when thousands of peopIe did that, it broke that consensus.
that's what the anti-Vietnam War movement did.
it broke that consensus.
go ahead, react. - React to what?
react to the greatness of the march on the day. Are you happy with that?
RonaId Reagan waIked onto the poIiticaI stage as a candidate for governor in 1966. During his campaign, he found that attacking what he caIIed " the mess at BerkeIey " pIeased the crowds.
it began a year ago when the so-caIIed free speech advocates, who in truth have no appreciation for freedom, were aIIowed to assauIt and humiIiate the symboI of Iaw and order, the poIicemen, on the campus.
that was the moment when the ringIeaders shouId've been thrown out of the university once and for aII.
he won by pandering to a citizenry that was outraged by what these insoIent, ungratefuI chiIdren were doing on the campuses.
as a matter of fact, I have here a copy of a report of the district attorney of AIameda County.
it concerns a dance sponsored by the Vietnam Day Committee, sanctioned by the university as a student activity, and was heId in the men's gymnasium of the University of CaIifornia.
the incidents are so bad, so contrary to our standards of human behaviour that I couIdn't possibIy recite them to you here in detaiI.
but there is evidence of things that shouIdn't be permitted on a university campus.
let me just read a few excerpts.
'the totaI crowd at the dance was in excess of 3, 000, incIuding a number of Iess-than-coIIege-aged juveniIes. "
'three rock'n'roII bands were in the gymnasium pIaying simuItaneousIy and aII during the dance movies were shown on two screens at the opposite ends of the gymnasium. "
'these movies were the onIy Iights in the gym. "
'they consisted of coIour sequences, different coIoured Iiquids spreading across the screen, foIIowed by shots of men and women on occasion. "
'Shots where the men and women's nude torsos on occasion... "
'and persons twisted and gyrated in provocative and sensuaI fashion. "
this portion of the Gray Line in the city is the first and onIy foreign tour within the continentaI Iimits.
the fountainhead of the hippie subcuIture.
the hippies' is often a strange worId which they Iive in.
they take many trips.
and the trip of a hippie is generaIIy an unusuaI one.
across the bay from BerkeIey, a countercuIture emerged on the streets of San Francisco.
descended from beatnik era hipsters, hippies further exposed the chasm between our parents' generation and our own.
by 1966, more and more of us were turning on, tuning in and dropping out.
our aIienation ran much deeper than poIiticaI protest.
we were aII beginning to see that it was much bigger than the war.
it was much, much bigger than the civiI rights movement.
there were major things wrong.
I think the peopIe who got invoIved in the countercuIture perceived that they did not want to be a part of what was wrong with a cuIture that was destroying the worId.
I can see that much better in retrospect than I couId right then.
but the point is that it was the cuIture that was sick.
it was the whoIe American way of Iooking at things that was sick.
so I think we came to a reaIisation that one way to change that is to just Iive it differentIy.
instead of trying to change the structure in a direct confrontationaI way, you just drop out and Iive it the way you think it ought to be.
do you pIay anything besides a sweet potato?
just the drums and the trumpet.
Yeah, and I go up in the mountains and yeII now and then.
you do what? - Go up in the mountains and yeII.
way up high in the mountains and yeII as hard as I can.
what's the purpose of that? - To greet the dawn and the greet the noonday sun and to greet the sunset.
you stay aII day yeIIing at morning, noon and night?
right. And standing on my head and making gardens and painting pictures.
you not onIy pIay the sweet potato, you aIso grow them?
right.
why do you induIge in smoking this... these narcotic cigarettes?
why do peopIe drink aIcohoI?
it's the same reason. - It's a big Ping-Pong tabIe.
you say why do we do this and we say, " Why do you do this? "
we don't agree... You're the mess. We're trying to change it.
Why? What are you trying to change it to?
what are your principIes? Do you have any?
we're not trying to change anything. We're just trying to be ourseIves - and do what we think is right. - Why don't you go out in the desert instead of dirtying up a community?
we're not dirtying up anything.
my parents sent away to the Bay Area a serious young foIk singer.
I came back with Iong hair down to there.
I was wearing an enormous amount of beads around my neck.
they figured I had abandoned everything I was taught.
I reaIised...
we had big arguments about this stuff.
I tried to convince them to seII their furniture and go to India.
and they weren't going for it.
I reaIised that no matter how far out their poIiticaI views were, because they were mighty unpopuIar, my parents were pretty Ieft wing, that reaIIy they were materiaIists.
they were concerned about how the weaIth was divided up.
at that point, in my consciousness, I didn't care about weaIth.
we were actuaIIy Iiving communaIIy, rather than taIking about communism.
seII that radio. Get rid of the subscription.
tune in to those other bands that do not broadcast in words, that broadcast in joy.
the form of God is the joy of his discovery.
up, up, up.
everybody goes up.
the countercuIture burst onto the BerkeIey campus during a strike in the faII of '66.
at the cIose of a meeting, students started to sing Solidarity Forever then suddenIy switched to Yellow Submarine.
they're singing, " We aII Iive in a yeIIow submarine. "
what does this mean? - Again, it's difficuIt to expIain.
I think... We take this music seriousIy and there's a meaning.
a meaning which everyone can interpret differentIy about the yeIIow submarine.
it's a sort of...
it's an understanding that we're banding together in a yeIIow submarine and it represents a new way of Iooking at Iife.
the radicaIs of BerkeIey and the hippies of Haight-Ashbury had a naturaI affinity.
we were visionaries, criticaI of conventionaI society.
but we disagreed about how to change the worId.
this running argument came to a head over the war in Vietnam.
sometime in Iate 1966, BiII MiIIer, who'd been active in the Vietnam War movement and ran a bar in BerkeIey, caIIed some peopIe active in the anti-war movement to a meeting behind his bar.
some peopIe from Haight-Ashbury were organising some kind of activity.
they wanted to teII us about it and ask for support.
it was going to be the first be-in.
there was one this feIIa in particuIar, he was trying to reaIIy get us excited about the pIan.
he said, " We're going to have so much music and so much Iove and so much energy that we're going to stop the war in Vietnam! "
the poIitics of hip is that we were setting up a new worId, as it were, that wouId run paraIIeI to the oId worId but have as IittIe to do with it as possibIe.
we just weren't going to deaI with straight peopIe.
and to us, the poIiticaIs, a Iot of the Ieaders of the anti-war movement were straight peopIe, as they were stiII concerned with the government.
they were going to march on Washington.
we didn't even want to know that Washington was there!
we thought that eventuaIIy the whoIe worId wouId stop aII this nonsense and start Ioving each other as soon as they aII got turned on.
it's amazing that these movements coexisted at the same time, and were in stark contrast in certain respects, but as the 1960s progressed, they drew cIoser together and began taking on aspects of the other.
as Burns stumbIed out of that bunker dazed, with bIood on him, parts of his friends on him, he coIIapsed into the arms of Larry Craig, and he mumbIed to Larry Craig.
he didn't mumbIe, " Those bastard Vietcong. "
he didn't mumbIe, " Those bastard communists. "
he didn't mumbIe, " Those sIope-eyed bastards. "
he mumbIed onIy one thing over and over.
'that bastard Johnson. That bastard Johnson. "
the aim is to buiId a powerfuI peace bIock that can reaIIy have infIuence in the 1 968 eIections, and we must make it cIear that we are not going to Iet our poIiticaI forces and the poIiticians ignore Vietnam in 1 968.
this must be an issue if that tragic war is stiII going on.
and so, as the war hawks escaIate the war in Vietnam, we must escaIate our protest against the war.
we're in front of the OakIand Induction Center today because this pIace is going to be cIosed down October 1 6th to 21 st.
we are decIaring a draft hoIiday for that period, and we're going to cIose this buiIding down.
the movement from protest to resistance, which was the officiaI sIogan of Stop The Draft Week and became a major sIogan within the anti-war movement, had something to do with the Iogic of the anti-war movement.
there'd been six, seven, eight years of educating peopIe about the war and of protesting it.
MeanwhiIe, the war was being escaIated aII the time, getting worse and worse, and there was a feeIing of impotence in the face of the further escaIation of the war.
we were becoming much more aIienated from American society and much more wiIIing to be disruptive of that society, and, basicaIIy, we began moving toward the view that we wanted to make the cost of pursuing the war abroad the ungovernabiIity of the society at home.
I'd been very infIuenced by Martin Luther King and Gandhi,
I beIieved very deepIy in non-vioIent civiI disobedience, and here were these Ieaders on campus... I was a graduate student, and they were saying, " We have to raise the stakes. "
"we have to stop the war in a much more miIitant way. "
I found their rhetoric seductive.
I think we were pretty convinced that we were going to shut down the induction centre when we went there.
we feIt strong, there were a Iot of us, we feIt weII organised, we had a Iot of pIanning meetings.
we didn't want to say, " We don't cooperate with the war. "
we wanted to say, " We aren't going to aIIow you to wage the war. "
'we're going to fight you. "
tuesday morning, the poIice came in, wieIding their cIubs.
they took us seriousIy.
we said we were going to fight them, so they fought us. It was a disaster.
we just meIted. They wiped us out.
now it was, " Here come the buses, and there is not a damn thing you can do about it. "
I began seeing aII these young faces in the windows going by me and I just wanted to reach out and just grab them and stop them and say, " Listen, this is your Iife you're putting on the Iine here. "
but what came out was, " Don't go. "
join our Iines. You don't have to go. AII you do is say no.
say no. You don't have to go. You don't have to go.
you don't have to go. You don't have to go.
there were bus-Ioad after bus-Ioad after bus-Ioad of young men that day, and they were going off to die.
and I remember being physicaIIy sickened, reaIising that I couIdn't affect even that part of the war.
here I was, face to face with these young men, and yet not one of them turned back.
I don't think we stopped one inductee from making that criticaI choice of stepping across the Iine and going to Vietnam.
I don't think we made one bit of difference that day.
does the demonstration bother you? - No, I think it's funny.
aII them bums running round, doing nothing.
tomorrow we go down there twice as strong as we did today.
we go down there with twice as many shieIds as we did today, and we go down there with everybody wearing one of these.
if you can see the dents in there.
I don't know if you can see it from here, but that's what stands between me and a cracked skuII from the highway patroI of the state of CaIifornia.
where do we get the hats? - Where do you get the hats?
army & Navy SurpIus. - Army & Navy SurpIus.
we were abIe to buiId for another demonstration on Friday, and on Friday we, in fact, had our riot, the riot that we had pIanned.
the event that I remember the most was when the students surged and pushed against the poIice and pushed them back, bIock after bIock.
I remember thinking, " This is Iike a metaphor. "
'if enough Americans beIieved the war were wrong, we couId end it. "
we controIIed the downtown area of OakIand for most of the day, and the cops were outnumbered and confused and scared.
we shut down the induction centre.
we did what we said we'd do, we shut the mother down.
I went to the Stop The Draft Week protests.
and what I saw there made me convinced that action in the streets of that sort was not going to Iead to the kind of change necessary to stop the war.
I saw a Iot of peopIe from BerkeIey tear peopIe's fences down.
fences that beIonged to peopIe that probabIy made $5, 000 a year were ripped out to bIock peopIe's cars.
Bobby Avakian, son of a judge, a weII-known young wouId-be radicaI, Iet the air out of the tyres of the district attorney.
this was going to stop the war?
I just thought this was a burIesque of opposition to the war.
there's nothing eIse to do.
the picketing and aII of that wasn't working.
it's time for confrontation.
we did stumbIe upon a strategy where we said, " If you continue that war in Vietnam, there's going to be chaos here in the streets of the United States. "
'every pIace you try to do anything to do with the war, there's going to be thousands of young peopIe rioting, trying to stop you from doing it. "
whiIe it was a great success a turning point, it was aIso the first cIear demonstration that the radicaI part of the anti-Vietnam War movement was coming up against its own Iimitations.
it didn't reaIIy have the weight in society to stop the war.
I think that it was after that that the BerkeIey radicaI scene became more and more cut off from reaIity, and the question of moving American society, changing peopIe, reaIIy was getting Iost.
move. I've got to go to work. - There's a war on.
I don't care. I've got to go to work.
we began to see ourseIves as, you know, gIue in the keyhoIes.
we began to see ourseIves as obstacIes in the way of the system fuIfiIIing its potentiaI for wreaking destruction aII over the worId.
I think we began to see ourseIves as being as big a pain in the butt as we couId, and I think we Iost the idea that we couId be victorious.
as confrontation and sit-in and street demonstrations escaIated, the rest of the United States' poIiticaI community was Ieft behind.
I was interested in the rest of the United States, in the Newport Beach.
those peopIe I'd faiIed with in the Thanksgiving vacation Free Speech Movement were the peopIe you had to reach if you were going to stop the war, and the way to do that was not to go down and sit in in the streets in front of the OakIand Draft Induction Center and tear up fences and bIock streets.
the way to do that was to be active eIectoraIIy.
after the Tet Offensive, when WestmoreIand came to Johnson, and said, " In order to continue the Iand war in Vietnam, we're going to need a miIIion men, "
johnson was toId by J Edgar Hoover that if we tried to get a miIIion men out of this country, he couId not ensure the domestic security of this country.
and that was one of the questions, one of the considerations he made, when he decided to end the Iand war, to begin to puII back from the Iand war, and to resign as an expression of the faiIure of his poIicy to win the war in Vietnam.
and Hoover saying that he couIdn't protect, he couIdn't ensure domestic security, was a truthfuI statement about the power of the anti-war movement at that time.
we did put Iimits on America's abiIity to wage the war in Vietnam.
I shaII not seek and I wiII not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president.
we want to taIk about this thing caIIed vioIence that everybody is so afraid about.
here you are, taIking about you're afraid of vioIence, and the honky drafted you out of schooI to go fight in Vietnam.
you sit in front of your TV sets and Iisten to LBJ teII you that vioIence never accompIishes anything, my feIIow Americans.
you ought to teII him cIear, " If you don't want any troubIe, keep your fiIthy white hands off our beautifuI bIack skin. "
keep them off. Keep them off.
in the streets of OakIand, a few miIes from the BerkeIey campus, the BIack Panthers came forward as the cutting edge of BIack Power.
their miIitancy had a magnetic effect on the student movement.
we want the Panthers to be our friends.
we want to foIIow their Iead in some fashion that's confusing, that's mysterious.
aII we are aware of, we want to go, bIack and white together, into some positive future against the oppressor who was feeIing ever more oppressive.
Bobby SeaIe and Huey Newton formed the BIack Panther Party in the faII of '66.
they drew up a ten-point pIatform addressing community needs from education to housing.
the most pressing issue was poIice vioIence against OakIand's bIack community.
the Panthers decided to arm themseIves and patroI the poIice.
peopIe might imagine we were right behind the poIice car.
no. We may be four bIocks away. We just drive through.
if we see the poIice arrest somebody, we'd get out of the car with our guns, tape recorders, Iaw books.
by now, we have six, seven members doing this, aII with guns.
how we got our guns was fantastic, too, the first guns.
the Little Red Book, The Thoughts Of Chairman Mao Tse-Tung.
Huey caIIs me and says, " I know how we can raise some money for guns. "
I said, " How? " He said, " The Little Red Book. It's aII over the news. "
I heard you can buy them at the China bookstore in Frisco. "
'how much money have you got? " I said, " 50 bucks. "
we run to the China bookstore, buy about 100 of these books.
we got our guns strapped on our side. I got a 45.
Huey's hoIding a shotgun, LittIe Bobby's got a Carbine.
we got these bags over our shouIders with Little Red Books.
red Books! $1 ! " we were buying them for 20 cents and seIIing them for $1, BerkeIey Campus, at Sather Gate right there!
we soId out in the matter of an hour.
we took this 100 bucks and we'd buy some more Red Books.
we made $200, $300. We went out and bought two shotguns that day with The Little Red Book! We hadn't even read the thing.
peopIe think we came up with this hardcore ideoIogy reIated to Mao...
we must have soId the book two or three months before we decided to open the thing and actuaIIy read it.
anyway, the next thing I know, I'm marching on the CapitoI.
because we were up there to protest a biII they were trying to put in to keep us from carrying guns.
RonaId Reagan is over here on the big front Iawn.
I got a statement to read.
the BIack Panther Party caIIs upon American peopIe in generaI and the bIack peopIe in particuIar to take note of the racist CaIifornia IegisIature, which is considering IegisIation aimed at keeping bIack peopIe disarmed and powerIess at the very same time racist poIice agencies throughout the country are intensifying the terror, brutaIity, murder and repression of bIack peopIe.
RonaId Reagan is escorted off the Iawn by the state capitoI poIice.
I said, " We can go inside somewhere. Isn't there a spectator section? "
I have these BIack Panthers up here.
can we get in here?
wait a minute. Wait a minute. - Are you going to arrest him?
am I under arrest? - Did you pIace him under arrest?
am I under arrest? - Take your hands off me!
they've put trumped-up charges of conspiracy and feIonies on everyone who went in to exercise a constitutionaI right and said they had no right to bear arms in a pubIic pIace.
the CaIifornia penaI code, section 12020 through 12027, and the Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the citizen a right to bear arms on pubIic property.
our organisation was Iike a sociaI evoIutionary accident, so to speak.
when you compare the NAACP from 1908 and other organisations, etc, and aII the years they put in to become estabIished, in just six months the BIack Panther Party has internationaI notoriety.
we're on the front page of the London Times and papers in Africa somewhere.
we were a broke IittIe organisation with a number of shotguns, a very weak treasury, and we were worried about how to pay the rent.
and, boom. I mean, we were shocking peopIe.
we have probabIy said to white America...
the peopIe who were observing us when we came out with the guns are saying, " Niggers with guns! "
it's Iike a fear. They don't even have to say it.
their faces said it. " There's too many niggers with guns. "
like they know that they repressed us, and now we were organised with guns. This is the new step.
it's symboIic that, " They're not going to be non-vioIent any more. "
on the night of October 28th 1967, Huey Newton was stopped by poIice. There was gunfire.
officer Fry was kiIIed, and Huey Newton was arrested for murder.
his triaI drew the student movement into an aIIiance with the BIack Panthers.
'free Huey " became our raIIying cry.
the organisation just propeIIed.
it took off Iike a prairie fire, it spread everywhere.
certainIy beyond my imagination.
after Huey's arrest, that's when things reaIIy started roIIing.
free Huey now or eIse! Free Huey now or eIse!
the Panthers exercised a heavy infIuence in the imagination of the white Ieft, partIy because the white Ieft was confused about who it was and what it ought to do.
they were fascinated by this tough, macho image and they foIIowed it not so much wiIfuIIy but invoIuntariIy, because it was a projection out there of the thing in their own actions that thriIIed them most.
we had captured the imagination of the white radicaI Ieft to a point that its whoIe identification became connected with what the BIack Panther Party was doing, how it was personifying things.
and it was Iike we infIuenced them in whatever direction we thought that they shouId go.
I don't Iike to say suck up, but they were awed by the Panthers.
the Panthers were somehow confronting the white power structure the way they wouId have Iiked to have done, some of them.
but not aII. Many of the whites who Ied the Stop The Draft Week couId have been invoIved with it.
many of those peopIe who had been in some parts of the earIy SDS was as scepticaI as I was.
but no one wouId, of course, say any of these remarks pubIicIy.
I mean, you didn't need that hassIe.
so, what a Iot of us did, I think to the detriment of the bIack movement, perhaps, and to the Ieft movement in generaI, a Iot of us with years of poIiticaI experience and organisationaI skiIIs dropped out.
if not dropped out, stepped to the side in this period.
Huey P Newton is the onIy Ieader that bIack peopIe shouId recognise!
Huey P Newton is the onIy Ieader that bIack peopIe shouId recognise!
a man who is wiIIing to stand up and face that pig, and on his own terms.
gun for gun if necessary.
this must be done!
you cannot sit there and aIIow that man to be raiIroaded any more.
you must free our Ieader. He must be freed, and he wiII be freed.
two days after the assassination of Martin Luther King, the war of nerves between the BIack Panthers and the OakIand poIice came to a cIimax.
on ApriI 6th 1968, a shoot-out erupted in which EIdridge CIeaver was wounded and Bobby Hutton was kiIIed.
Bobby Hutton was instructed by the cops to run from here to the poIice car, or the area where it was, and was IiteraIIy shot down.
he was shot over ten times.
he had five pistoI buIIets in his head.
a cIear-cut case of murder.
as brother Huey P Newton says, racist pig cops must stop their wanton murder and brutaIity or suffer the wrath of armed bIack peopIe and the bIack communities defending themseIves.
HistoricaIIy, in retrospect, those guns were somewhat our nemesis.
we were never reaIIy abIe to pIay that down.
the poIice, the media, used that.
we got hung up into a confrontationaI thing with the poIice over those guns that we were never reaIIy abIe to Iive down.
we say, bring it on. If you want war, Iet there be war.
this is what we say. Is that cIear?
in other words, if he is convicted and sentenced to death, OakIand wiII erupt.
this whoIe country wiII erupt. We're going to do everything we can to see to it that the whoIe worId erupts. Is that cIear?
the Panthers seemed even crazier than they were because they were pIaying the media and the media was Ioving them.
the media picked up their current, fed the narrowest parts of their image back to us in the most dramatic, hyped terms, that the Panthers themseIves wanted them to be projected.
it drove the poIice crazy.
they were furious and wanted to get them aII over the country, and it drove some of us...
weII, it incited some of us with superficiaI fantasies of a kind of revoIution that was compIeteIy inappropriate.
it had nothing to do with the actuaI Iandscape of possibiIity.
it was interesting to me more deepIy and metaphoricaIIy.
if that was what they were doing, what was appropriate in our community?
the Panthers, in a sense, Iet, in my opinion, white radicaIs off the hook, some white radicaIs, not aII, some white radicaIs off the hook for what SNCC had chaIIenged them about three years earIier.
that was to organise the white community.
they couId say they supported the Panthers as they were the vanguard.
they assumed the movement couId onIy be Ied by bIacks.
they made it cIear bIacks wouId be the group to start the revoIution, and that the Panthers were the army of that bIack vanguard.
I was taken up with, " Now we're not onIy a protest movement, we're not onIy a movement to end the war in Vietnam, but we are a revoIutionary movement. "
we were wrong. It wasn't a revoIutionary situation.
but it was a mistake.
everybody can make a few mistakes.
and, at the time, it had a Iot of the aspects to us of a revoIutionary situation.
68 was a reaI high time, what we were doing.
we identified with the student movement and the Iarge protest movement in Paris.
there was the Prague Spring and the feeIing that revoIution was in the air, east and west, capitaIist and communist.
it was aII coming apart in a new spirit.
a new wave of Iiberation was in the air.
I feIt that the worId was unraveIIing, history had speeded up, that the worId was swirIing around me.
the movement had expanded. The anti-war movement was immense.
the women's Iiberation movement had begun.
the worId was undergoing change at a rate that I couId hardIy comprehend, and yet I was in it and I was part of it, and I was changing.
I aIways remember this particuIar period of time, because the change was so phenomenaI.
I went to sIeep one night and I was a woman who was dissatisfied with my position as a woman in society, but I feIt soIitary in that dissatisfaction.
and suddenIy I wake up and, right and Ieft, everybody is speaking about it.
I have women who agree with me everywhere.
we start to form a sisterhood.
everything in my Iife that has disturbed me is being chaIIenged.
things that haven't disturbed me before, suddenIy they do.
when we began to try to take a more active roIe in steering committees and decision-making forums in the movement, we began to see our comrades resisting our input.
and we Iooked at them and we said, " What? "
'how can they do this to us? These are our brothers. "
'why aren't they interested in what we have to say? "
"they're onIy interested in the fact that we're aIways there for them. "
"and we aIways make the coffee and we run off the IeafIets and we make aII the teIephone caIIs Iate into the night, and yet when we try to participate on a more active IeveI, we meet resistance. "
what you see here is the beginning of a movement that women are human beings and that we have equaI rights.
we intend to go to schooI and have chiIdcare so we can go to schooI.
we want the university to run cIasses that teach us about our history, the same as bIack peopIe want to Iearn about their history.
that's what is happening today. This is just the beginning.
one of the ways the women's movement is the IogicaI and maybe even inevitabIe concIusion of the '60s is that throughout the '60s we were trying to imagine how to Iive differentIy, how to change the worId.
the women's movement took much from the civiI-rights movement, the new Ieft, the anti-war movement, but we brought it home.
we brought it into the kitchen, we brought it into the bedroom, we brought it into the most personaI, intimate aspects of peopIe's Iives.
it was hard to deny there.
it was hard to ignore those issues.
when I thought of revoIution then, the whoIe idea had assumed compIex, enormous dimensions.
it didn't mean a simpIe change in the institutionaI order.
it meant a coordinated change in aII the dimensions, aII the aspects of Iife.
how we were with ourseIves, how we were with each other.
this was so compIex a programme, you couIdn't write it down as the 13-point programme of the BerkeIey RevoIutionary Front.
this was something that wouId take thousands, miIIions of peopIe engaged aII their Iives in expIoring this end of it and this end of it and how these ends might fit together, and it was cIear by then that aII this expIoration was there to do.
peopIe had begun each part of the expIoration.
I forbear to Iist them, OK?
and, at the same time, it seemed impossibIe. There was no time.
the war got worse faster, the poIiticaI activity got worse faster, they were kiIIing more and more peopIe.
every time you pIaced some degree of hope in a nationaI Ieader...
so much Iife, so much death.
so much possibiIity, so much impossibiIity.
there we were, attempting to change nationaI poIitics, and found ourseIves at the Chicago Convention.
it changed American poIitics in unpredictabIe ways.
we had not anticipated, speaking for those invoIved in the eIectoraI side of poIitics, we did not anticipate the arbitrary exercise of authority that Mayor DaIey wouId bring to bear in Chicago.
and it was phenomenaI.
mr Chairman, most deIegates to this convention,
mr Chairman, most deIegates to this convention do not know that thousands of young peopIe are being beaten in the streets of Chicago.
and for that reason and that reason aIone.
I request the suspension of the ruIes for the purpose of adjournment for two weeks to reIocate the convention in another city of the choosing of the Democratic NationaI Committee and the presidentiaI candidates...
wisconsin is not recognised for that purpose!
there was a side of American poIitics that was vicious and vioIent, and that's what we saw in Chicago.
DaIey roIIed over the anti-war forces, and it was a destruction of the Democratic Party.
it seemed impossibIe that there couId be any significant eIectoraI path toward ending the war foIIowing the convention.
it seemed that what had happened in the parks of Chicago made the anti-war movement destined for direct action for quite a period of time.
the vioIence in Chicago triggered confrontations on campuses across the country.
BerkeIey students caIIing for a Third WorId CoIIege initiated a strike which provoked daiIy battIes between poIice and protestors.
after eight weeks, Governor Reagan sent in the NationaI Guard and the strike died down.
EventuaIIy, an ethnic studies programme was estabIished, but in the wake of the strike, an atmosphere of tension remained.
a month Iater, student and community activists came together to create PeopIe's Park.
I was one of those peopIe who beIieved that the countercuIture couId be revoIutionary.
it's hard to taIk about that without taIking about PeopIe's Park.
a group of peopIe took some corporate Iand owned by the University of CaIifornia that was a parking Iot, turned it into a park and then said, " We're using the Iand better than you used it, and it's ours. "
for a brief moment in history, in PeopIe's Park, the countercuIture and poIiticaI activists had a magicaI fusion.
it was a way of Iooking at the future. It was utopian.
it was a way of saying, " If we had controI of our Iives, this is what it wouId Iook Iike. "
in a down-to-earth way, we were showing in our very activity the image of a new society.
our job is to form a countercuIture, a more ruraI cuIture, a more decentraIised cuIture, to deveIop counter-vaIues of cooperation, of a production for use rather than a production for profit, deveIop that cuIture in hope that that cuIture wouId be in revoIutionary contradiction to a bourgeois cuIture.
and that we shouId view ourseIves as revoIutionaries but reaIIy as founding mothers and fathers of this countercuIture.
I can aImost convince myseIf now!
as I see it, the great hope impIicit in the PeopIe's Park is that in our Ieisure time, so to speak, we wiII make the sociaI revoIution.
property is not a thing to keep men apart and at war, but rather a medium by which men can come together to pIay, a peopIe's park.
peopIe's Park managed to focus aII of the frustrations as weII as some of the ideaIs of the '60s.
there was a beIief in the environment, a beIief in the participation of ordinary peopIe in poIiticaI decision-making, a beIief that a Iot of things ought to count that traditionaIIy don't count when they're caught up in government and university bureaucracy.
there was aII of that.
but the fact remains that I beIieve the PeopIe's Park incident was extremeIy cynicaI on the part of the demonstrators.
they wanted a confrontation.
what mattered was getting peopIe out in the streets, demonstrating.
Roger Hinds and the regents and RonaId Reagan can't aIIow this to go on.
if there's one Iiberated territory, peopIe may get the idea there couId be other Iiberated territories.
the park issue is not the issue.
the issue is, " We must have a confrontation throughout the summer. "
they were out of confrontation issues.
and as soon as you give them a park, they'II dream up another confrontation.
we have been invaded by peopIe outside of the state, outside of the cities, we have been invaded by miIitants.
this is... We're in a revoIution, and the onIy thing, don't ever say we're going into a revoIution.
we're in a revoIution! Now the question is, who wiII win it?
when Jesus disrupted the foreign recruiters, his foIIowers said...
'power to the peopIe. Out, demons, out. "
I decIare this pIace decontaminated from poisons, chains and Iies, from the abomination that defiIes.
the demons have returned to the nothingness from which they came.
earth, water, air and fire, witness our Iiberation.
this property is private.
you are now trespassing.
unIess you Ieave, you wiII be arrested for trespassing.
if they didn't want the park, they shouId've stopped us when we started, and not Iet us work on it every day and then just take it away.
I have a suggestion.
let's go down to the PeopIe's Park, because we are the peopIe!
we want the park! We want the park!
here they come.
those peopIe toId you for days in advance that if the university sought to go ahead with that construction on that property, they wouId physicaIIy destroy the university.
governor, we offered to negotiate many times.
negotiate? What is to negotiate? What is...?
wait a minute. On that issue, don't you simpIy expIain to these students that the university has a piece of property that it bought for future construction of the campus and it was now going ahead with the pIan? What do you mean, negotiate?
governor Reagan, the time has passed when the university can just ride roughshod over the desires of the majority of its student body.
the university is a pubIic institution, an important institution for aII of its own community and for the BerkeIey community around it.
aII of it began the first time some of you who know better and are oId enough to know better Iet young peopIe think that they had the right to choose the Iaws they wouId obey, as Iong as they were doing it in the name of sociaI protest.
when the fence went up, the whoIe experience of PeopIe's Park changed.
governor Reagan brought in the NationaI Guard, the city was occupied for a month, and what happened is, the worst aspects of the movement emerged.
peopIe did things that were totaIIy counterproductive.
they tried to provoke the NationaI Guard into fixing their bayonets.
they tried to cause skirmishes on the campus.
I found it possibIe to resist the feeIing, the coIIective haIIucination, that we were invoIved in a revoIutionary struggIe.
but there was one moment when I became immersed in that feeIing.
there was a peacefuI demonstration on SprouI PIaza denouncing the university's overreaction to the park, the poIice brutaIity towards students, the NationaI Guard on campus, occupying the city.
my boyfriend and I and a friend of mine went down to the pIaza to hear the raIIy, and as we got there, we reaIised that the poIice were Ietting peopIe into the pIaza but they were not Ietting peopIe out.
my friend, by that time, had aIready gone through the poIice Iines and I motioned for her to come back, and they wouIdn't Iet her out.
pigs off campus! Pigs off campus!
KiIIers off campus! KiIIers off campus!
requesting you aII to Ieave the pIaza.
if you don't Ieave, you're going to be shot in the next five minutes.
I started hearing the sounds of a heIicopter, and it came cIoser and cIoser and the sound got Iouder and Iouder and suddenIy the heIicopter swooped over the whoIe campus, over aII the students, and I thought, " We're going to be shot at. We're the Vietcong. "
everybody on the outside of the poIice Iine was running to try to get away from the gas.
everybody on the inside of the poIice Iine was trying to get out.
and the poIice were beating peopIe as they tried to get out.
we went back to Kroeber HaII and waited for my friend to show up.
she'd been through the miII. She had been throwing up, it was nausea gas.
so we drove up to the rose garden.
we were standing there, Iooking out across the roses and the campus, and there were stiII heIicopters circIing around.
she Iooked at me and said, " I can't stand this. I'm going to get out. "
I said, " I think you're right. I think it's aII over. "
'I don't think we can stay here any more. " It was a poignant moment.
and a year Iater, we were aII gone.
we aII feIt very defeated.
it was a horribIe experience to gas students at a peacefuI raIIy.
and it was one reason why peopIe began to feeI that we had to reassert what we reaIIy stood for, that we reaIIy had to protest the park in a dignified and peacefuI way, and recapture the originaI spirit of the park.
and that Ied to the MemoriaI Day march.
we'II get PeopIe's Park back eventuaIIy.
everybody who's ever done any hitchhiking knows that basicaIIy we can't Iose. When you sit out and hitchhike, in the front seat are the parents and they give you this reaI scared, contemptuous Iook as they drive by, but then, in the back seat, as they drive away, you see the kids going...
we got the kids on our side and we can't Iose. We just can't Iose.
when you're in a mass movement to change society, when you're in this experience of this democracy breaking out, you don't want it to end. You want the storm to continue.
you want to keep that sense of change and overwheIming power that one gets from the ocean.
you might not be abIe to keep the rowboat straight or up, but you don't want the storm to die.
there was no vision, no articuIate phiIosophy, no conception of sociaI organisation and sociaI change.
what there were were a series of emotionaI moments, a series of passions, a series of desperateIy important issues.
but you can't beat something with nothing, and if you're going to fight this kind of Iong cuIturaI battIe, you are bound to Iose if you don't have a coherent, articuIate, weII-worked-out vision of what you're trying to do and that they didn't have.
we had taken what we had as far as we couId go.
I think that it's important not to Iose sight of what that movement accompIished.
that is, it was part of the struggIe for civiI rights.
it was part of the movement in this country that broke down the Jim Crow barriers and changed the caste reIationships of bIacks and other minorities in our society.
it was part of the movement that IiberaIised American cuIture.
it was part of the movement that gave way to the ideas of women's equaIity and women's Iiberation.
it was part of a movement that uItimateIy made it impossibIe to carry out so bIatantIy the kind of imperiaIistic foreign poIicy that characterised the period after WorId War Two.
american society was profoundIy changed by the movements of the '60s.
in the '60s, we came at a certain point in the CoId War to reject the ideoIogies of both sides, and our decIaration of freedom was a poIiticaI freedom, but it had a Iarger dimension, that is, the freedom of imagination.
having gained the freedom to see the worId freshIy and the abiIity to act for change, we carried what we'd Iearned into the rest of our Iives.
from personaI issues to pIanetary concerns, we continued to expIore the potentiaI for change.
and as we watch activists for human rights and democracy around the worId chaIIenge the powers that be, we know that each generation has its chance to make things change, and that no generation can do it aIone.
we shaII Iive in peace!
Ugh. What is this?
cantaloupe, ma'am. lt's ice cold.

lt's only a lousy nip and tuck.
l wouldn't do that. All of a sudden tonight she says to me, " No, l think you should stay another week. "
l think you should sit down. God.
ma'am, l wouldn't do that.
'lt's not as if money is an issue, " she says.
money has been an issue my entire fucking life.
l think l should take a look at that.
she's one of those Nurse Ratched types, you know?
the Nazi in the white sneakers.
you know what l did?
l just hit her, pow! Right in the ear.
give me another drink. --l think you should come upstairs.
no, just, l want another drink.
ma'am, l think you should rest.
just give me the goddamn bottle!
for Christ's sakes. --l think you should...
will you get off of me?
that wasn't very nice, was it?
l'm sorry.
Rafferty, l'm sorry.
l'm sorry. No, it's okay, it's okay.
l just, you know, sometimes l just...l lose control, you know? --lt's okay, Miss Duke.
l know.
Rafferty?
ma'am?
my face really hurts.
l can see that.
lt really hurts.
you should get some rest. --l'm just gonna take...
no, l don't think you should
miss Duke, l don't think you should...
ma'am.
l don't think you should be drinking with these, ma'am.
would you please...?
let's get you upstairs.
l have an extra one. Do you want this? --l'm good for now.
Oh God, l should call the clinic and tell them that l'm still alive.
you mean you didn't tell them that you were leaving?
well, not in so many words.
l mean, l left rather abruptly.
l think l should call them then.
look, don't apologize to anybody, understand?
Eva Braun, she really deserves it.
and l'm not going back.
Yes, let's get you into bed now and get some rest.
Oh wait a minute, shoes. --Okay.
there we go.
allow me just to... there you go.
just get the clothes out of the way. Oh God.
lt's a tragedy.
l'm telling you, Rafferty, l've spent millions, literally, millions.
look at these suitcases under my eyes look at this.
come here, look at this.
this is time catching up with me.
l...l can't see anything there, ma'am.
Oh, your eyes are they blue or grey?
uh, they're...they're bluegrey, l think.
you should go to sleep.
go to sleep, ma'am.
are you gonna be warm enough there?
ma'am? --Yeah, sit down right here.
uh, l'll sit here and then l can get you what you need.
no, come back here. What are you doing?
get your ass over here. Sit down.
um, ma'am, l...
you should have some water here.
okay.
just take a wee sip there.
that's it.
that's water.
lt is, ma'am.
dehydrated otherwise.
there.
okay.
you should get into the bed.
ma'am.
there you are.
are you warm enough there, Miss Duke?
Oh yeah, l'm... yeah.
still a little confusing.
who's that?
let me...let me just slip that out.
see? We have a wee temperature of just over 99.
just take these now.
what is that?
antibiotics.
what l need now is the strongest pain pill known to man.
okay, but take these first.
l remember leaving the clinic.
l...l...remember being in the car.
but you know, it's like a jigsaw puzzle put together in my head.
and l...l remember taking a drink.
a drink or two, plus a few painkillers.
Lafferty, did we fuck last night?
no, ma'am.
l don't know if you fitted the nurse piece into your jigsaw puzzle.
Oh, shit. l'm gonna get sued again.
no no no, l called the clinic this morning.
l explained that you had a bad reaction to the medication.
l told them that you regretted the incident.
and l hope you don't mind, but l took the liberty of sending the nurse some flowers and a wee gift certificate.
for how much?
$5, 000. --Jesus.
all concerned agreed that the matter is now completely closed.
bet she spends it all on Nazi memorabilia.
that's good. Well done.
will that be all, Miss Duke?
Yeah.
Mmm. Oh, but, Lafferty, your outfit...
Yes, ma'am?
well, you look like a goddamn undertaker.
l mean, you think you could lighten up a little bit?
of course.
l'll do that.
miss Duke? Can l help you, ma'am?
Yes, you can start on that.
my babies have outgrown their pots and l'm going to repot them all.
right you are.
this one here, is it? --This one.
right here. Take that out...
and then you'll cut it in half.
take it out? --Mmhm.
here, let me help you.
there.
okay, now try. --Okay.
you loosened...loosened it up.
there we go. --That's it, that's it.
and get your knife. --All right.
and don't here, put it in the alcohol first.
just one infected bulb and they'll all go.
that's it. --ln half?
tough little creatures, huh?
and then any of the bulbs that don't have leaves, you're gonna get rid of.
all right.
then you can fill it up and you can clip off the excess dried roots.
you can see which ones they are with this.
l...l worked in a flower nursery some time ago for a while.
and if l may say so, Miss Duke, you have one hell of a collection of orchids.
Yes.
this is my newest baby.
all the way from Brazil. lt doesn't look like much now, but wait until you see it in bloom.
you know, my daddy...
he loved orchids.
and when he died, they put a mountain of 'em around his his casket.
must have been $25, 000 worth.
l still remember the way that church smelled.
gonna need you to go to the bank for me tomorrow and get some cash. --Yes, ma'am.
l'll call them in the morning.
what's your name? l'll need to tell them.
Lafferty. --Your first name.
Bernard.
l'm going away for a while and l've decided to take you with me.
ma'am? --Yes, you.
Yes, ma'am.
now cut it use the knife.
uh dupup! Dip it in the alcohol first.
we'll take it when l get back, all right, sweetie?
you told me that the last time you went away.
did l say that, really? --You said that, really.
l'm so bad.
you really are. --Did you go to the bank?
Ah, and you counted it?
here you go.
thank you. --You're welcome.
so you're getting ready to leave town already?
l am.
so l was thinking...
maybe...maybe l could hang out here for a while...
no no. --...while you're gone.
what do you mean, no? --No. No way.
all these rooms just sitting here empty?
the rooms will be fine.
l just hate to see this whole house sitting here empty.
Oh, it's so sad.
no. Don't take it personally.
l am taking it personally. --Of course you are.
whatever. --Oh, " whatever. "
Oh, you're sulking now.
am l sulking? --You're sulking.
l'm not sulking. --Yes you are.
come on oh yes you are. Yes you are.
come on, don't sulk.
l'm not sulking.
don't be mad. lt's nothing.
l'm not sulking. --Yes you are.
make sure that these boxes are secured, please.
no, be careful with these. Please lass, thank you.
how do you like living in my world so far, Bernard?
l like it very much.
who wouldn't?
let me see your palm.
you're righthanded. --l am.
so this is what you're born with, this is what you become.
you have a, oh, an old soul with a double heart line, and all these little things coming off are unhealthy relationships. --ls that right?
am l right? ls that an unhealthy relationship?
l don't know, is it? l mean, l've had a few...unhealthy relationships.
and this is a very unusual line.
see, l have that also. That's your fate line.
that means that very extraordinary things will cross your path, and you have to be alert or they'll just pass you by.
And...yeah, well, what is your star sign?
that's never been my scene.
uh, Aries, is it?
when's your birthday?
14th of April.
14th of April, that's Aries.
so you are an instigator, you start things.
you're well, you hit a wall, you get right back up again and then hit the same wall again.
uh, sounds familiar.
and really? So that does sound familiar?
uh, l like to do embroidery.
uh, call Vincent and tell him that l don't want him to exercise the dogs until we get there.
have him check the surf report.
you haven't lived until you've surfed the tube in the bay.
you brought swim trunks, l assume?
no, ma'am, l can't swim.
well then, put that down " Swimming lessons for Lafferty. "
ma'am, l don't think that will be necessary.
no just l'm serious, write it down.
sure. --Put it on the list.
memo to staff.
miss Duke and l shall remain in Hawaii for another three months.
l shall be supervising the renovation of the swimming pool, the tennis courts and pergola.
ln our absence, see that all silver is polished and carefully sorted.
miss Duke's personal tea service needs special attention.
memo to staff: we arrive at Falcon's Lair on Tuesday and we expect to leave for Sri Lanka the following week.
miss Duke and l shall be traveling through the Far East for the next six months.
Oh, be careful, be careful, be careful.
very gently get her into the house.
Bernard?
would you like to join with us?
no, thanks.
Bernard's a little wary of new experiences.
lt took me months to convince him to pierce his ear.
shall we have some lunch?
are you comfortable there, Swami?
okay.
Doris was given tons of money to restore all these houses in Newport.
she did a great job.
Thanks. What l love about Newport...
wait, how many houses do you have?
doesn't matter. But what l love is the weather.
lt's got rain and snow and rain lashing against the rocks.
lncredible storms. lt rains twice a year once for six months, once for five months.
that's really good, Lafferty.
that is so funny.
very good. Here, have a...have a little hit.
a little hit?
should l do that? --Absolutely, you should.
one big suck.
getting high with the help.
how democratic.
get enough there?
thank you very much.
thank you. --Thank you.
uh, so, what were you doing in Calcutta anyway?
you know, l really l didn't have the faintest idea until l met Swami.
he was in a cave for 25 years.
he was praying. Praying 25 years.
praying. lt's not true.
Yes. No. The poor, the sick, the bereaved, the dying, they would come to him.
he would lay his hands on them and pray.
and then one day the monsoon comes and floods the cave.
so Swami gets up and he walks all the way to Calcutta that's 2, 000 miles or more because he wants to visit the Festival of Durga
where we are amongst the 200, 000 pilgrims that are there.
and what happens? Coincidentally, literally, we bump into Swami.
literally bump into him.
Congratulations. --And the rest is, well, destiny, l suppose.
we're gonna start a center in New Jersey.
well, he didn't walk to New Jersey. He flew.
took the easy way out, hey, Swami?
you know, when l was sleeping sometimes outside and l watch all the sky's beautiful stars, then l thought l told Bernard and Doris that, you see, " You are sleeping in the Five Star Hotel. But l was sleeping All Star Hotel. "
lt's a blessing. A blessing.
to Swami and Doris.
and all the blessings that come into our lives when we least expect them.
cheers to that.
swami, if l was drinking, l'd be drinking to you.
Cheers, congrats.
look at this. Look.
are you all right, ma'am?
Oh, we've got a problem. --What is it?
damn slugs, look at this.
look look.
lf there's one there's probably more, right?
Yeah, it looks like it, ma'am.
you're not gonna eat my babies.
miss, you can apples. My mother swore by apples.
apples?
Yeah, we grew spinach and potatoes in our yard.
we couldn't afford to lose them it was mostly all that we had to eat, so my mother would put down slices of apple to attract the slugs and the caterpillars elsewhere and lead them away from the vegetables.
and that worked? --lt did, yeah.
lf this works, l'm sending your mother a check.
well, that's very generous of you, ma'am, but she passed away many years ago.
Lafferty, l know absolutely nothing about you.
maybe that's just as well, ma'am.
do you think you should be getting some rest?
you have a long trip ahead of you. --No, l'll be fine.
l can take care of this while you're away.
no.
l had a a child with my first marriage.
she only lived for 24 hours.
what do you think the point of that is?
l'm terribly sorry to hear that.
l mean, supposedly everything happens for a reason.
you know, part of the Book of Life or the Great Mandala.
you know?
what do you think about that?
l...
l...it's whatever gets you through the night.
l mean, l'd hardly be the one to judge it.
so the snail and the orchids and you and l?
you smell divine, by the way. ls that Norell?
lt is. l gave you that, didn't l?
you did. You gave it to me and l wear it every day.
l wouldn't be caught dead without it.
well, that's part of the plan, you see?
what about the apple?
do you think this apple here has... --Yeah.
...a part in the great the great plan?
Yeah. l mean, events may seem random, but there is a plan.
unfortunately, it just may not unfold quickly enough for us to really understand why it's happening. You know what l mean?
sure.
l...l knew this lrish lad in Philadelphia.
his name was Freezer. That's how cool he was.
and he had everything going for him, he was handsome, he was fun, he was warmhearted.
we were up for the same job at this chichi hotel, the Bellevue in Stratford.
l knew he would get the job. No one could resist Freezer when he turned on the charm.
anyways, on the day of the interviews he steps off the curb and he breaks his foot.
and l get the job.
and that's how l get to meet Miss Taylor.
she introduces me to Miss Lee.
then it's... --lntroduces you...
...to you. --...to me.
cause you read it on the resume.
Oh, so that's...that was your path.
that was your journey, exactly.
the Mandala, exactly. Mandala.
Oh Jesus, smell this.
Mm. lncredible, huh?
very few of these guys actually even have a scent. lsn't that tragic?
Yeah, they're beautiful. So sad.
miss Duke, do you think l should be packing the Persian outfits that you mentioned for your trip?
l don't know. What do you think?
l don't know. l've never performed in a bellydancing troupe.
lt's not belly dancing, it's dance oriental.
Oh, that's Chinese, is it?
no, look, it's the Earth and then the core and then out.
see? lt's as if your entire being is concentrated, every ounce of it right here.
right. --You see?
sure. --Right there, you understand?
lt's like...
like that.
Yeah. --Feel that?
go ahead, try it. Try it. --No.
l think it's more of...more of a girl thing.
no no, it's the most fun you could ever have without actually touching yourself.
go ahead. --No, l couldn't.
come on. --No.
see, like this? --Yeah.
some men actually find it very seductive.
l'm sure they do.
l mean, l...l swing in the other direction, if you catch my drift.
cat? Yes, l catch it.
l caught it.
l have it.
all right, well it's just that l...l think it it's mesmerizing.
how did l look just now? l mean, tell me the truth.
l mean, did l look ridiculous?
what do you mean? --l mean, was it clumsy?
did l look clumsy? Did l look awful? --No no.
l'll tell you what, you looked happy.
happy?
Yeah, just...
break a leg, Miss Duke. --God forbid.
miss Duke would like two men on duty at any given time.
that's one inside the house and one patrolling the grounds.
also four dogs.
nobody's to get in through the front gate when she's away except the gardeners and the pool guy.
they have been issued with passes like this.
and if you set off the sprinkler system with one of those, you'll be destroying $30 million worth of art and antiques.
Thanks, gentlemen.
Oh, l...l thought you'd gone home.
l've been having a wee clear out of my room.
you know what it's like.
l'll take that out for you. --That's okay.
lt's no big deal.
lt's fine, thanks anyway.
Thanks.
Lafferty, change of plans. l leave for London tomorrow.
book the Connaught. Make sure to tell Elton l'm coming.
send over my Russian fox and the new white sable pronto.
l rejoin the tour in Washington on the 15th and l'm running to Hawaii after that.
so make sure all the linens are changed.
tell the painters l want them out of there by March 10th, or l'm invoking the penalty clause.
ln no way am l kidding. Sincerely, Doris Duke.
Oh, PS have my new jewelry appraised and listed in the policy. Sotheby's can do it.
l prefer that nice Kathy, but if it has to be the other one, so be it.
welcome back, Miss Duke. --Oh, thank you.
l am so glad to be back.
are you growing your hair?
a bit, l am. Yeah.
come here.
here.
look. --What?
look.
what do you think?
l think it looks a bit puny.
well, you've got to give it time.
l like it. --You do?
l hope that your tour went well?
Oh, the arts in America, Lafferty, don't get me started.
you know, sometimes there were more of us onstage than there were in the audience.
l'm sorry to hear that, ma'am.
lt wasn't a total disaster, l made a little friend. --Oh, you did?
Mmhm. A kid in the company.
Oh, amazing dancer. l thought he was gay.
and actually, so did he. But you know, we have to leave ourselves open to all the possibilities.
lndeed, it's true.
you know, you should really wear more color to kind of lift your face.
look at this, for instance.
put this shirt now what does that shirt say?
that shirt says... --Too much.
... " look at me " . --lt certainly does.
you know, your shirt doesn't say anything at all.
see what l mean?
actually, Miss Duke, there is one thing of yours that l love.
lt's that scarf there.
l think that's the most beautiful... --Well, yeah, let's see.
Uhhuh, that brings out the blue in your baby blues.
lt does?
what about my eyes?
what about them? --The shadow.
you look great.
May...um...maybe it's a bit strong.
Really? --Just at the corner.
may l? --Yes.
just smudge it out a bit.
there, like that.
that looks great.
maybe you should wear a little eye shadow.
no, l shouldn't. --Just a touch.
l don't think l should. --You could try it.
what do you think of this?
l think it's gorgeous.
okay, why don't you press it?
um, Miss Duke?
l wondered if l could have next Thursday evening off?
Why?
just personal reasons.
you know that Maltese cross that l brought back from Paris?
Yeah, it's in the safe.
how do think that would go?
with this? lt would, yeah, absolutely would.
well, when you say personal, what do you mean?
l mean, do you have to go to a funeral or have a procedure or...?
lt's just, l have a date, sort of.
Really?
where did you meet?
l haven't met him yet. --lt's a blind date?
Yeah, well, through the personals.
lrish Echo. " -- " Village Voice. "
how uncharacteristically daring of you, Lafferty.
are you a stone or a sponge?
Oh, never mind. --What, excuse me?
well no, don't answer. Never mind.
permission granted.
miss Duke, thanks very much. l appreciate it.
l'll have this pressed at once.
Oh oh oh oh oh... scarf.
Oh, excuse me.
Bravo. l so love that one.
Oh my God. You sounded great, Miss Duke.
Peggy Lee couldn't do it better herself.
she could and she did and you know it.
cause Bernard used to work for Miss Lee.
ls that right? --No, l just made the phone calls, and l booked her rooms, and l held the umbrellas, and l opened the doors, that sort of thing, you know.
want some more champagne? --Please.
thank you.
now l heard that song for the first time in Las Vegas at Caesar's Palace.
that's a real crowdpleaser, that song.
what was the one that she did about the masochist?
l don't know, what song is that? --You know.
where the guy is treating her horribly and she's just loving it.
that sounds like the story of my life.
no, it's my life. --No, it's my life.
lt is not your life. --No, it is my life.
l think it's all of our lives.
well, go ahead, sing it.
now? --Now.
we only have now.
uh, wait a minute...
that's it.
you have to imagine a wee black dress on me with a million sequins.
what's the key?
get the fuck out of here!
what's the big deal? We both fuck other people.
Yeah, but you don't fuck my staff in my house on my dime!
all right, l'm sorry. l was high and l was drunk.
get the fuck out! --Why are you acting so crazy?
let's just talk about this. --Get out!
lt won't happen again. --Get out!
backstabbing son of a bitch!
Bye.
nothing makes me happier than the scent of orchids.
not even sex.
the one l'm really gonna miss is Paloma.
nobody could clean like that woman.
you know the that picture where Marilyn is crazy for guys that play the saxophone?
well, that's me with piano players.
mechanics.
Really? --Sweaty guy with his head under the hood, intent on his work with his hands all oily.
how many mechanics have you actually had?
none.
Oh, Lafferty. --l'm always afraid to make a move.
they might beat me to death with a monkey wrench.
no, see, that would make them much more appealing to me.
how was your date?
you don't have to pretend to be interested, Miss Duke.
no, l really am interested.
was he a mechanic?
no, he wasn't. He was something in sales.
pressed shirt and nice clean hands.
Oh, l'm sorry.
was he cute at least?
l wouldn't say cute exactly.
More...more like promising.
what happened? Here.
well, we talked and we had a few drinks.
and l talked some more and then, you know, " Here's me in 10 easytoassemble pieces. "
we have absolutely nothing in common.
so you struck out.
l did, yeah. lt was something of a relief, l have to say.
on my honeymoon...
the first honeymoon. That would be with..the first guy.
Rubirosa? --No, the first one.
Oh God, that guy had a body.
he's still one of my dirtiest fantasies, actually.
l just couldn't wait to get him in bed and...
Jimmy came toward me, l was swooning.
he was naked, stiff as a board, and scooped me up in his arms and he said, " Doris, l've been wondering, how much is my annual allowance gonna be? "
he didn't say that. --He did say that.
Oh my God.
what did you say?
you know, l bet a lot of guys find you hot.
you have a great face. --No, l don't.
no, really, it's so sensitive.
Oh, it's...
what?
miss Duke...
what do you want from me?
from me.
miss Duke? -What do you want?
l mean, you don't fuck me, do you?
no, l don't want anything. --You don't steal from me.
do you steal from me? --No, l don't want anything.
well then, what do you want from me?
l want to take care of you.
l just want to take care of you.
come on, Lafferty. Hit the gas, will you?
come on. --l don't want to go too fast here.
lt's...it's a wee road here.
Oh for God's sake, all right, pull over.
pull over, stop stop stop stop. --What?
l'll show you.
you all right there, ma'am? --Yeah, l'm fine.
got the seat belt? --No no, just go.
okay.
just slow down a bit.
Hi.
you hit 80 back there. Are you aware of that?
Oh yeah, mmhm.
and also, before you ask me, l do not have my license on me.
okay, l'm gonna have to ask you to step out of the car, ma'am.
Oh, it's too cold, really. l can't.
okay.
who's your friend?
Oh, that's the Sultan of Brunei.
welcome to New Jersey. --Thanks.
okay, l'm gonna have to breathalyze you.
l don't think so. l don't really want to be breathalyzed.
sorry. --Then, l'm gonna have to take you in.
no, l don't think so. Just get on your little walkietalkie or your radio or something and talk to your chief, because he and l are buddies from way back.
then he'll be glad to see you down at the station house.
what? --Okay, come on, let's go.
no. Whoa!
uh, ma'am, l'm coming!
wait a minute. Sultan?
lucky thing, you knowing the judge.
Oh, l know a lot of people.
he seemed awfully happy to see you.
Ah, well, yes.
we had a little moment in the coatroom of the Phillips Club about 20 years ago.
l don't find that funny.
you would if you'd been there.
do you know how many alcoholabuse charities we support?
how do you think they'll feel accepting money from a drunk?
lronic.
you have a moral obligation to set a good example.
lighten up a little bit.
you know, Lafferty and l, we're just trying to have a little bit of fun.
right, Lafferty?
Yes, ma'am.
just the coffee, please, thank you.
Oh, all right.
thank you, Lafferty. That'll be all.
ma'am.
ln all the years l've known you, you've never paid the slightest attention to your staff.
but this guy... --He puts up with my shit.
he's great with my orchids. He embroiders, for God's sake.
he's a bad influence, Doris.
l like him.
Doris, l've seen you figure people out in 10 seconds flat. You are a brilliant judge of character.
why can't you see that this guy is up to something?
how much does she pay you?
excuse me? --Your salary.
what does she pay you? Five grand a month?
l think you know my salary, sir.
you have access to the records.
l'm writing you a check for $200, 000.
$200, 000?
that's right.
on condition you go away and stay away.
l...l don't understand.
miss Duke hired you to be her butler, not her drinking buddy.
did...did she ask you to pay me off?
okay, l...Miss Duke would not be very happy if l walked out on her.
loyalty is very important to her.
l agree, loyalty is a valuable commodity.
let's make it $500, 000.
Do...do you think that's enough?
give you a little breathing space.
l am not that easy.
good evening, sir.
dear Lafferty, l get to my house in Newport on Tuesday, so make sure they fix the roof pronto.
l'm not having workmen all over the place while l'm there.
l thought l'd be back Sunday but l got invited to Bali with George.
lt is too good to pass up.
so l'll be stopping in Hong Kong on the way to lndonesia,
may 10th through the 24th.
book the Peninsula, l want my usual suite.
make sure l get my rate.
and l'll probably end up in Hawaii in my house for the summer but l'm staying in my Beverly Hills house along the way.
and the screening room is still a mess.
go there and oversee things yourself if you have to.
use Frequent Flier miles if possible.
all right, Lafferty, l've decided to extend my trip to see the migration in Botswana.
and please please please make sure all my furs are in storage.
l don't want them moldering away in the cedar closet a moment longer. Oh, while you're at it, see if you can get the stains out of the Balenciaga.
l don't know how they got there, but it is unwearable at this point.
sincerely, Doris Duke.
welcome home, Miss Duke.
thank you, Lafferty. l am so glad to be back.
Oh my goodness, look at you. Look at your hair.
lt's gotten so long. --l can cut it if you'd like.
no, l like it. lt's so Jagger, isn't it?
lt is? --Yes.
morocco was great? --Great, yes.
Absolutely. But exhausting.
l brought you back a little something.
a little gift?
are you chewing gum?
excuse me, ma'am, l'll take it out.
l don't think l've ever seen you chew gum.
look, your present voila.
for you. Hm?
what?
here. --That's for me?
that's for you. Try it on.
no no, it isn't. --Yes.
come on, don't be silly. --You're teasing me.
put your arm in. --lt's a caftan, is it?
yes it is.
an antique caftan.
that's oh, it's a perfect fit.
look at that. How brilliant am l? That's gorgeous.
perfect fit.
Oh thank you, it's just beautiful.
look, it's handembroidered, isn't it?
lt certainly is.
l can't believe it.
lt's the most beautiful present l've ever had.
lt is.
gorgeous. --Oh my God.
l feel like...l feel like Lawrence of Arabia.
ha ha! You know what? This is missing a button.
l just remembered. Could you take care of that?
l will of course, Miss Duke. Thank you so much.
you're so welcome. --Thank you.
l can't believe it.
well.
l mean, how could this happen?
look at this crown rot.
we might as well just pitch these.
and look at this. lt's got scale.
l mean, how did this happen?
how did that happen? --Well, l told the..l told the gardener. --That's why l left you in charge.
not the gardener.
now you're gonna have to just wipe the whole thing down.
l can fix it. l can fix it.
okay, right here. Here's the Pearla.
l know where it is, ma'am. --Well then do it.
not enough bark. --l know what to do, ma'am.
well then, do it then. Now that's too much bark.
please, Miss Duke, l can handle this.
all right, and it's 2 too hot in here.
so turn that down, wipe down all the plants, repot everything.
and don't forget the fucking baskets.
Yes, ma'am.
keep your breath going.
okay, keep your breath going.
what?
miss Duke? --Yes?
Waldo Taft.
what about him?
he's coming to dinner tonight.
Oh yeah. --What does he like to eat?
Oh God, what about that...
is that salmon still in the freezer?
well, l'm not allowed to throw anything out, so it's still there.
mm, then tell the chef to poach that.
that salmon's been here longer than l have.
lt'll be fine.
that salmon's leftover from when Jesus fed the 5, 000.
that's how old it is.
lt'll be fine.
try to open up your lower back a little bit.
l'll tell the chef to poach it.
this Marine Conservation Project seems very interesting, but l don't see the annual fiscal report anywhere.
lt's late.
well, no report, no money.
what's this now? --The AlDS research.
they've asked for a 10% increase over the last year.
lt's not unreasonable.
all right, done then.
what else do we have here?
some salmon, Mr. Taft?
lt's, um...
bon appetit.
the minister from the Baptist church in, l think it's Canton, North Carolina
Reverend Washington? l love that man.
what does...what does he want?
well, apparently there was a fire at his church.
they've raised $1 million but they need another $600, 000.
give him whatever he wants and l'll write a personal note.
what else?
what else do we have?
you're not hungry, Mr. Taft?
no.
how about a nice glass of Peu Chimay?
no, thank you. l never drink when l'm driving.
Lafferty, why don't you fix Mr. Taft some...coffee?
all right. Sure.
peu Chimay, ma'am? --No, just some coffee.
what's this now?
the literacy program. --Oh yes, the literacy program.
how are they doing? --Doing great work.
you know, l'm confused because l saw this State Senate report that made it seem as if there were some problems.
you know, when l first came to America l could hardly write my own name.
and then l took one of those literacy programs, and now look at me.
fuck.
no one wanted to tell you.
we know how fond you are of him.
petrus '899, '990, '991 all gone.
Christ.
Chateau Margaux '86, only the Premier Grand Cru.
well, he has excellent taste, you got to hand him that.
all the sherry maybe 100 bottles.
Jesus.
you want me to do something about this?
pack your bags. You're fired.
dear Miss Duke, as always, l found it difficult getting used to being in rehab.
but l have managed to stay dry for two weeks now and l think it's time l came home.
dear Lafferty, l don't believe people should be punished because they suffer from an illness.
that is why l haven't fired you, as l probably should have.
but l'm not yet ready to have you back as a trusted member of my household.
you will stay in rehab until l am ready to forgive you.
Doris.
Doris, you okay?
Doris, you okay?
Doris?
Doris?
Dr. Armenza, please report to lCU, STAT.
Dr. Armenza, please report to lCU, STAT.
she's had a...a sizeable stroke, but l think she will get over that.
lt will take time. She's gonna need rehab and physical therapy.
but l am concerned about her underlying condition, which has always been an issue, in terms of her heart disease. She's got a degenerative heart problem, and also the liver issues. Her liver function tests are not normal.
she'll need roundtheclock care for now.
here we go.
that's it.
what l did was unforgivable.
l'm so ashamed of myself.
you've taken me into your life, you've been extremely generous towards me.
l know l've let you down.
l can only say l'm deeply sorry.
l hope you can forgive me.
that's a good speech. You learn it in rehab?
l wonder if you could help l'd very much like to keep my job.
please.
Mr. Taft is calling for Miss Duke, sir.
okay.
excuse me, Nancy.
Mr. Taft. --Lafferty.
l'm at the front gate, let me in.
l'm sorry, sir, Miss Duke's not receiving visitors today, sir.
l want to talk to her. Put her on.
she's not taking calls either, sir.
put her on. --l'm sorry, sir.
l'm only following Miss Duke's orders, sir.
l know what you're up to... --Mr. Taft,
miss Duke appreciates your concern, but her priority right now is to avoid all stress. --Put her on right now.
and if you're truly her friend, you'll respect her wish to be left alone.
Lafferty, for crying out loud. --Yes, sir.
thank you, sir, goodbye. --This is ridiculous...
what are the police doing here?
we're just trying to establish the facts, Doris.
l'm old, l have a bad heart, my lungs are for shit, end of story.
did Mr. Lafferty try to control your behavior in any way?
well yes, he certainly has.
he's no visitors, no phone calls, lights out at 9:00.
lf devotion beyond the call of duty were a crime, he'd be a candidate for Death Row.
that's what you call it? " Devotion beyond the call of duty? "
sorry to disappoint you, big guy.
thank you, Miss Duke.
l'm sorry, Doris.
for all l knew, you might have been locked in the attic like Baby Jane.
that's Blanche. Baby Jane had the keys.
lt worries me, you being out here alone.
let me get you proper care roundtheclock nursing.
l'll think about it. --They'll cluck around you like mother hens. --Stop it.
they'll be patronizing you, treating you like a child.
blah blah blah blah blah.
'lt's time for your bath now, Doris.
have we taken our medicine today? " --Oh stop it.
they'll drive you nuts. --Just stop it.
l'm still being punished, is that it?
lt's not about you, Lafferty.
l've tried to think of everything l can to win back your trust.
l've ceased to exist outside this house, l've renounced my own life in order to give you the care that you need.
and now you discover it's not enough? --The nurses are coming in the morning. --lt's the nurses or it's me.
Oh, don't make idle threats.
lt's not an idle threat, ma'am.
well then, stop it!
for God's sake.
would you bring in the nurses if it meant losing me?
l won't be put on the spot. -- Answer me, please.
lt's a simple question, ma'am. Just yes or no.
l don't want you to go if that's what you're asking.
so you would do without the nurses?
l want you to stay.
ln my current capacity?
Oh for God's sake, Lafferty.
l choose you above all others.
ls that what you want?
and you are not to prevent Mr. Taft from seeing me, ever.
Agreed? --Agreed.
we can still bring the nurses in if you think it's necessary.
Oh no. You wanted me, now you got me.
my daddy had pneumonia and my mother sent away all the maids so she wouldn't have any witnesses.
and then she stripped him naked and opened up the windows, because that's the way they do it in Macon, Georgia, she says.
of course, this was New York.
the coldest October in history.
l was only allowed to see him for a few minutes every day after school.
you could see your breath in the room.
the man froze to death in his own home.
she thought that she would get everything, but my daddy knew what kind of woman she was and he left it all to me.
my father died when l was three.
my...my mother died when l was eight.
l was coming home from school one day and there was an ambulance there at the end of our road.
a crowd was rubbernecking.
she was sitting up against a car.
lt might have been the same one that hit her, l don't know.
l thought she was all right because there was no blood or anything like that.
lt looked like she was just having a snooze there in the middle of the road.
her shopping was scattered all about...porridge oats and pink custard powder.
the only family l had after that was an aunt in Philadelphia.
fate.
here, let me give you a hand with that, Miss Duke.
you just missed it...a bit here.
there, take a look.
l need more eyes.
sure.
that's okay. Let's do the other side.
you know, when you do it, you should start from the base to the tip. Try it on you.
from the base to the tip? --Yeah.
okay, like that?
Yeah.
good evening, Nancy.
will that be all, Miss Du... --Oh stop it.
just sit down.
happy birthday, Miss Duke.
l'm afraid this is not one of your more glamorous birthday parties.
Oh, l've had much worse.
perhaps you'll be up to having a party again next year.
Lafferty, there are a couple of things l want you to do for me when l'm gone.
do we have to talk about that now?
my bed socks, for instance. --Bed socks?
Yes, l sometimes wear bed socks when l sleep.
l've done so since l was a little girl, and if l should be wearing my bed socks when l fall off the twig, l would like you to please remove them from my feet before the coroner gets there.
l don't want to look like a complete idiot.
Yes, sure.
no fancy speeches.
no press.
and l would like you to...dress me in something casual.
life is a journey, after all, and l refuse to go into that box wearing an evening gown or something equally stupid.
Yes, sure.
make it a natural fiber, not manmade.
silk might be a good idea.
l want to demonstrate my solidarity with nature.
of course. l could come back as a tree or a bird or a bug, or...
who knows?
will you do that for me, Lafferty?
Yes.
promise?
l promise.
l must have lost my mind to believe a fucker like you.
am l dead yet?
not yet.
just keep her hydrated. --Yes, Doctor.
sure you don't want me to call a nurse?
no, l don't think so.
call me if you need anything.
here we go.
that's it.
l'm just going to adjust your pillow.
all right?
that's it.
that's it. Here we go.
there you go.
good night.
sleep tight.

on the table, please.
l have hereunto set my hand and affixed my seal to this, my last will and testament, on this fifth day of April, 1993.
Doris Duke.
good afternoon, gentlemen.
good afternoon.
let's get on with it, shall we?
well, you have the agenda before you, beginning with item number one...
there are many universes and many earths, parallel to each other.
worlds like yours, where peoples souls live inside their bodies.
and worlds like mine, where they walk beside us, as animal spirits we call, Daemons.
are we going to see the child?
I should think so.
so many worlds, but connecting them all, is Dust.
dust was here before the witches of the air, the Egyptians of the water,
the bears of the ice.
in my world, scholars invented an Alethiometer.
a golden compass. And it showed them all that was hidden.
but the ruling power, fearing any truth but their own, destroyed these devices,
and forbade the very mention of "Dust."
one compass remains, however, and only one who can read it.
you'll never catch me!
lets go get him Lyra.
Billy! You come back here!
run, Roger!
... Will do what ever we say!
hurry up Roger, or they'll "gobble" you!
hurry Up!
stop! If you value your lives, come no further.
Why? We played the game fair and square.
this ain't no game, Billy Costa.
don't you know what gate that is?
it's the back door to your stupid college.
so? -- There's a curse on this gate.
you Gypsians ought to know that. Crossing this gate, is worse than touching another person's daemon with your bare hands.
why hasn't anything happened to you?
because we live here. We got safe passage, y'see?
anyway, my mother was the one who put the curse on this place in the first place.
what mother? I heard you were an orphan.
and your uncle only left you here cause' nobody wants you.
come here and say that.
don't, Billy!
you should listen to your mate.
the scholars got this special ring mail ideal for trespassers.
they got this poison ring, and it burns you alive!
rubbish. Hand him over.
it ain't rubbish. I'll prove it, I'll steal it!
you can have Roger, as long as you try it on.
alright. Bring it with you tonight. Or else. War.
Billy, don't!
see you later then. -- Ok.
you weren't really gonna hand me over to them?
of course not. I'll steal one of the scholar's gown.
he'll never try it on anyway.
lord Asriel? -- Good morning, Hunt.
well the Master we be relieved that you've arrived safely.
I'm sure he will.
you should listen to me once in a while. -- Stop being such a coward.
if I weren't such a coward, where would you be?
in the retiring room already.
come on, quick!
let's find a robe and get out of here.
don't be silly. I want to look around.
you know that if you get a smack, I hurt too.
you're gonna get us caught.
Oh no! I told you!
lord Asriel is an eminent fellow of the colleagues.
as Headmaster of Jordan...
you must force him to abandon his plan.
they're talking about Uncle Asriel.
I speak for the Magisteria.
the Magisteria has no authorities within these walls.
my dear fellow,
the Magistirium has authority everywhere.
and Asriel will be silenced.
one way or another.
that may be... But while he's at Jordan, his proposal will be heard.
I'm not dispensed with centuries of intolerance, free enquiry.
and that's my final word on the matter.
now, if you'll excuse me.
I shall call the council to order.
I guess we lost that bet. -- Hush, Pan.
Lyra! He's leaving, let's go! Lyra!
Oh no, Stelmaria.
the Master asked me to decant a bottle of bourbon 1995 for you,
lord Asriel. He remember you were partial to it.
thank You.
Lyra! -- It's poisoned!
nonsense. -- It ain't nonsense.
I saw that man from the Magistirium pour some white powder into the wine.
go back in there. Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut... Go on.
ahh, Lord Asriel this a rare pleasure.
may I introduce Fra Pavel from the Magisterium.
we've never met, but l follow your exploits...
closely, Lord Asriel.
that's what the smell is...
master, Gentlemen, I shall go straight to the point.
hunt, the lights.
this photo grail is taken at the magnetic north pole.
in Svalbard.
kingdom of the Ice bears.
lord Asriel, is that light rising from the man's body or is it coming down.
no, that's coming down from the sky, but that's not light.
it's Dust.
what's Dust? -- I know, it can't be the normal sort.
there's plenty of that here.
Parague dictum, gentlemen.
allow Lord Asriel to explain himself.
it could be an aborational malfunction of some kind.
no it isn't. No aboration of any kind.
the behaviour of these particles is quite unmistakable
dust is flouting in to this man, through his daemon.
from a city in another world.
a world very much like our own in a parallel universe.
co-existing with our own, invisible, intangible, inaccessible.
until now. From there, and from a billion other worlds Dust flows.
worlds of infinite possibilities, somewhere men have no daemons, somewhere daemons have no men...
men without daemons. That's impossible.
even some who have no Magistirium... And no authority.
that is heresy.
that...is the truth.
I wouldn't recommend that you defy, gentlemen.
it's Cought.
to discover the source of Dust, I intend to travel to these worlds.
with this sufficient source of energy.
and... Well... a sufficient source of funds.
I humbly beg the college council to fund such a journey.
it wasn't my fault. She wouldn't listen to me.
I will not have my niece slithering round like an alley-cat.
you're not very grateful, are You?
I've just saved your life!
uncle, why did he try to poison You? -- You wouldn't understand.
Yes, I would. -- Well, I don't see why.
apparently you are impossible to educate, a miscreant, and a liar.
what will the Magisterium do to You now?
the Magisterium's day's are numbered.
what does that mean? -- Trouble, with a bit of luck
did you get the money you needed? Are you going North again?
the college counsel has defied The Magistirium.
I'm leaving immediately.
can I come with you? I wanna see the Ice bears, and glaciers, and learn about Dust and everything.
what do you know about dust?
nothing. -- Good.
keep it that way. Be a good girl and do what you're told.
but you don't do what you're told!
you don't let anyone tell you what to do!
Yes, and look at the welcome I got!
hush Pan. -- I can see your daemon still changes shape.
has it settled yet? -- Yeah.
that's got to do with Dust, isn't it.
why kids daemons can change shape but grown-ups' can't.
Lyra, Dust is none of your business.
now, You try and behave.
my uncle Asriel said he'd take me to the north, the next time he goes.
he swore it. Cause' he needs my help you see. -- Ahh! What for?
fighting probably. Or spying. He uses me as a spy sometimes.
like now for instance. I'm supposed to keep an eye on them Gobblers.
they took them gypsian kids out Boundry Ray.
Billy Costa told me.
I heard them Gobblers take them down to hell.
of course they don't!
you're afraid of them, aren't you? - No I ain't.
but the adults are. Kids keep disappearing.
they go after the poor kids, you see?
the orphans... And the servant kids as well.
Roger, I promise: If you were taken by the Gobblers, I'd come and rescue you.
you'd come get me to wouldn't you?
of course. It's everybody who would come looking for you, if you were in trouble.
you're a lady. -- Says Who!?
cook. He says that's why you are the only one who live here.
to make you a lady.
nobody can make me a lady! Not the master and the scholars and porces combined. Right!?
take it back, or we ain't best mates no more.
alright, You ain't a lady!
Lyra! Lyra Belaqua get down off them roofs!
the Master wants you at High Table.
the state of your knees. And your hair.
well... It's not surprising.
Roger and me has been hunting Gobblers.
it's dirty work.
don't you make jokes about them Gobblers.
ain't nothing to play about when children go missing.
Lyra, my dear, the tutor in Metaphysics tells me you missed your lesson again.
now, I know you do not always understand our need to educate you, but sometimes you must do, what others think is best.
but I disagree, Master. -- Mrs. Coulter.
when I was a young woman I knew that no one could truly ever understand me.
except of course my daemon. And that it would be best if we were to do as we pleased.
sit down, Gentlemen.
who's she? -- Don't know, but she shut up the Master, alright.
Mrs. Coulter, this is our Lyra, Lyra Belaqua, Lord Asriel's niece.
Lyra, this is Mrs. Coulter, a friend of the college.
lovely to meet you. -- Lovely to meet you, too.
you know, I've met Lord Asriel?
it was at the Royal Arctic Institute.
we discussed the political structure of the Ice bears of Svalbard.
you've seen an Ice bear?
as the matter of fact, I have had an audience with the Bear king himself, Ragnar Stursson.
and I'll tell you something I probably shouldn't:
king Ragnar is desperate to have a daemon of his own.
...and Ragnar likes to think of himself as a person,
and he will stop at nothing to get one.
but you mustn't repeat that. -- Oh, I'd never!
I feel I can trust you.
I have to go back to the north very soon.
I'm going to need an assistant.
me? Got to the North? -- North?
it's cold up there.
we'd better get the Master's permission.
master, I was wondering if I might borrow dear Lyra?
only for a while, of course.
I'm not sure that would be consistent with Lord Asriels wishes for her education.
I'll deal with Asriel.
you mustn't deny me this little thing, you mustn't.
very well.
a bet's a bet. Lyra was supposed to show up with the gown.
I told you they wouldn't let her out of the college.
which one is her room?
what are you gonna do? -- Give her a fright, that's what.
if we get caught, I'll be skinned alive.
the night pool is bound to be going his rounds.
Ratter, check if the coast is clear.
it's all clear.
Billy! Billy!
the scholars still refuse to hand over the last alethiomether.
and now they've given Asriel all the funds he needs.
if he succeeds in proving the existence of these other worlds it will contradict centuries of teaching.
there will always be free thinkers, and heretics.
unless we deal with the root of the problem.
that is why Mrs. Coulter's work is so important.
what progress has she made? -- The doctors at Bolvanger, are close to perfecting the inoculation against the effects of Dust.
I am relieved to hear that.
if we can protect our children from the corrupting influence of Dust, before their daemon's settled, we will nurture a generation at peace with itself.
one that will never question our authority again.
we owe it to the young. Do we not?
I fear, our defiance will not go unpunished.
we failed her. -- We protected her as long as we could.
she's still a child. She can't possibly be a threat to them.
she is.
she is meant to play a major part in what is to come.
how do you know such things?
the Witches.
could you stay by the door? Mrs. Longsdale, it is important to know if I was followed.
Yes, Master.
for you, Lyra. -- What is this?
an Alethiometer. Also known as a Golden Compass.
it was given to the college by Lord Asriel, years ago.
and now, I'm giving it to you. I feel, you are meant to have it.
what's it for? -- It tells the truth.
we've always tried to acquaint you with the truth, but the secrets of the heart and things, elude scholars and authorities.
this lets you glimpse things as they are.
keep the alethiometer to yourself.
it is of the utmost importance, that Mrs. Coulter does not know that you have it, Do you understand me?
of the utmost importance.
Lyra! Are you ready?
there's someone missing.
I want to say goodbye to Roger. -- Roger? Who's Roger?
my friend. He works in the kitchen.
we must go. The ferrie's about to take off.
why don't you write him a letter?
you can tell him all about the journey and even leave a photograph.
what do you think? - Yeah, I suppose.
Mrs. Coulter, what's that?
that is the Magistirial seat, Lyra.
what's the Magistirium for?
the Magistirium is what people need.
it keep things working.
by telling people what to do.
but you told the Master you did whatever you pleased.
that's Right. Clever girl.
well... Some people know what's good for them, and some people don't.
besides, they don't people what to do in a mean, petty way.
they tell them what to do in a kindly way.
keeps them out of danger.
sugar?
svalbard
look Pan, it's got lots of pictures in the end.
what do they mean? -- Don't know.
the needle keeps stopping at the same symbols.
lady, lightning bolt and a baby.
then it goes back, and does it again, see?
what do you think makes the needle move?
I don't know. Maybe Uncle Asriel knows.
maybe we're supposed to take it to him.
all washed, and ready for bed...
we have a busy few weeks.
Oh it was a stylish enough party.
but why they don't offer more ice with their drinks.
I shall never understand.
I'll only be a moment, Darling.
what? -- She likes to show off her new pet, doesn't she?
she's never taking us to the North.
we're like prisoners in this house. All these rules, and rooms we aren't allowed in to.
perhaps we shouldn't have invited Professor Docker.
he's such a bore isn't he?
and he had sauce in his beard.
but he is one of the foremost experts on particle Metaphysics.
have I told you what a particle is? -- Oh I know about particles.
like Dust. That's a particle isn't it. -- Dust?...
I mean the Dust from space. That Dust. Like in the north.
where did you hear about that?
it must have been one of the scholars at Jordan.
a wise person knows, Lyra, there are some thing we best ignore. Subjects that you...well... never speak about.
but l... -- Yes, You didn't know, so I forgive you.
just don't mention it again.
now, Darling, You take off that childish shoulder bag.
I don't like seeing you wearing it indoors.
but please Mrs. Coulter. I do love it. -- But I do not.
put it away.
Lyra, put it away now. -- I don't want to.
if you will not obey me, we will have an argument which I will win.
now put it away at once!
it's absurd to be carrying around a shoulder bag in your own home.
jordan is my home.
Lyra!
don't! Please, it hurts!
do as I tell you. -- I promise.
thank you.
and while you're at it, you must learn to control your daemon.
he is much to wild.
now, kiss me.
I hate her!
I hate them. And look. They're spying on us.
what do they want with us? Why are we here?
did you see her daemon?
he began to shock when you mentioned the word, Dust.
and what does she keep in that room?
let's go find out.
maybe this isn't such a good idea.
over here.
that's just one of her stupid guest lists. -- No it isn't. Look at it.
"Intercision." What does it mean, Pan?
and that?... General Oblation Board...
G. O. B. -- Gobblers. From the letters. G. O. B.
workman, Edwards, Parslow, Costa.
Billy and Roger!
pan, it's her. She's running the Gobblers! -- Lyra, where are you?
we have to get out of here.
Lyra!
Lyra, what have you been doing? -- Nothing.
well we must find something for you to do.
will you help me arrange our passage to the North?
you do want to come to the north with me, don't you?
where is he? I don't see him.
Lyra, this way!
quick, Lyra!
Lyra!
what are we gonna do, Pan?
we got to save Roger. And Billy.
we've got to save ourselves first.
where are we gonna go?
anywhere is better than here.
come on, this way!
split up, the girl can't be far.
spread out. Search all the buildings. -- Gobblers!
you, cover the canal.
there they are!
pan! -- Run, Lyra!
don't be afraid now, Lyra. Come here.
you're save with us. -- Your Mama Costa.
Billy's Mum.
but, what are you doing here? -- We've been in your shadow ever since, you left Jordan College, watching over you.
an a good thing too. You best come with us.
where are we going? -- To see Lord Faa, Lord of the Gypsians.
not very friendly, are they? -- What are you looking at?
ma Costa!
this is the child.
it's alright.
how do you do, Lord Faa?
Lyra... Come and sit by my side.
this is Fader Coram.
these are the chiefs of the gypsian families.
you're are our guest here and you are under our protection.
lord Faa, I want to thank you. For keeping watch with me and all...
but why did you do it?
lord Asriel has been a good friend to the Gypsians this many a year and...
this many a year it has been our charge to bring him news of you, as we traveled along our ways.
but you didn't know that, did you?
and when Mrs. Coulter got a hold of you, well...we suspected she had something to do with the Gobblers.
and she did. She and them Gobblers took my little boy, Billy.
we know your tale up until the Costas found you.
is there anything else you can tell us?
is there anything you may have forgot?
don't show it to them.
the Master of Jordan gave me this.
I thought they was all take by the Magisterium.
it's an alethiometer. It's a truth measurer.
a Golden compass. It enables you to see, what others wish to hide.
you've got three handles that you can control.
by pointing at three symbols,
you can ask any sort of question you can imagine.
once you've got your question framed, this blue needle points to more symbols, - that give you the answer. -- Could it be used to find the missing children?
not by me. The art was Jalousi-guarded. -- Can I try?
alright. What are you doing, Lyra?
you don't know how to read it.
well, the serpent is cunning, like the Gobblers.
and the Pot could mean a recipe or a plan...
the baby. That means kids.
one thing I do know, Lyra: You mustn't grasp at the answer.
hold the question in your mind and lightly, like it was something alive.
it's an hourglass.
but it came around to it on the second time.
the first time it only stopped there a moment.
on top of the hourglass, is a scull.
thank you. Finish your letters now.
Billy Costa, why didn't you write anything?
your mother must be missing you terribly.
I don't know what to put in the letter, Miss.
they haven't told us what we're here for.
you're here to help us.
and just as soon as you've helped us, we'll send you back home.
that's what you should write.
or don't they teach gypsian children to write?
they teach us to write the truth.
Billy, just write the letter.
well, as I'll be posting these straight away,
I'm afraid your parents will be disappointed.
I confess, I am puzzled by your interest in the Belaqua-girl.
for one thing, she is in possession of the alethiometer.
How?... Oh yes, the Master.
can she read it? - Of course not.
are you familiar with the prophecies of the witches?
you think she is that child?
impossible. None the less, she must be found.
they'll seek her out, like bees to honey.
svalbard.
kingdom of the Ice bears.
we shall have to watch ourselves,
Stelmaria. You can bet, that Coulter-woman has hired every samojed-bandit, from here to the pole, to hunt us down.
don't be so hasty. We can work this out like gentlemen.
don't worry, Lyra. We'll find Roger.
I'm alright.
what is it? -- It's a spy fly.
is it dangerous?
the one that got away is.
if you was to crack it open, you'd find no living thing in there.
no animal or insect, at any rate.
there's a clockwork.
and in it is a bad spirit with a sleeping poison in its sting.
we'll keep him safe... In here...
what was it after? -- You, Lyra.
why me? Why are they doing this?
we don't know.
but we Gypsians are being hurt worse than most by these Gobblers.
these child thieves, They're taking our children up North.
the land of cold and dark.
and what they are doing with them there, we don't know.
but we have heard terrible rumors.
our aim is first and beyond all to rescue these children.
both gypsian and landloof or like.
but if they have been harmed...
I promise you, if they have been harmed...
...there is not a place, nor on land, nor on sea for these Gobblers.
and when the time comes to punish, we will strike such a blow, as will make their hearts faint.
and fearful. We will strike the strength out of them.
we will leave them, broken and shattered.
are you getting scared, Pan? -- Scared?... A little.
it's all bigger and scarier than we ever thought.
maybe we shouldn't be doing this. -- But we've got to, ain't we?
go on, I mean.
who are you?
my name is Serafina Pekkala. Clan queen of the witches of Lake Enara.
a witch. Where's your daemon? - Kaysa can fly a long way from me.
are you the girl, the Magisterium seeks?
the one with the symbol reader?
let me see you read it. I want to know if you can tell me, which of the men on this ship, was once my lover.
father Coram.
he was young and beautiful once.
and we witches live for hundreds of years.
father Coram wishes to know where the child-cutters take their prey.
it is a place they call Bolvangar.
a place of fear.
a regiment of Tatars with wolf-daemons guards it.
birds do not fly above.
animals flee from it.
even the samojeds fear it.
it is a weeks march from Trolleund on the coast of Norway.
you will find something to help you in Trollesund.
you will need all your courage.
I'm glad I've lived long enough to see you... Child.
can you see anything? Lyra, you're not listening to me!
that's a mighty fancy clockwork you got there.
it's just a toy. -- Uhuh. Then it's a mighty fancy toy.
how did you come by something like that?
Oh lord, Lee when are you gonna learn to mind your own business?
I do beg your pardon. Lee Scoresby. And this old girl is Hester.
I'm Lyra. This is Pan. Pantalaimon.
mighty pleased, Miss Lyra.
you rode in with them gypsian fellows, am I right?
here I go again. Don't answer that.
what are you doing in Trollesund, Mr. Scoresby?
Oh, a friend of mine got himself into a fix.
so I come to see what I can do about it. -- Me too.
of course, that ain't my normal occupation.
most of the time I plan my trade up in the sky.
you're an aeronaut!
can I go up in your ship? -- I'd be honored.
just as soon as I get her out of hawk.
miss Lyra, I'd like to give you a word of advice.
if I was on the kind of scout, that I reckoned you are,
I'd hire myself an aeronaut, and an armored bear.
an armored bear? -= There's one in town.
lorek Byrnison's his name.
works at the sled depot behind Arson's Bar.
he would be good to have on your side in a scrap.
not that you're looking for that.
lorek Byrnison, lorek Byrnison. May I speak to you?
what!? -- We want to offer you employment.
I am employed. By the town's people.
I mend broken machinery. I lift heavy objects.
what kind of work is that for a panser-bjorn?
paid work!
is that what they pay you? Whisky?
lorek Byrnison, you are the first Ice bear, I have ever met.
I was ever so excited and scared. But now I'm just disappointed.
I heard that bears lived to hunt and to fight.
why are you wasting your time here, drinking whisky?
I stay in this town because the town's people gave me spirits and let me drink till I was asleep,
and they took my armour away.
and without my armour, I cannot go to war.
and I am an armoured bear. War is the sea, I sleep in, there I breathe, without my armour I am nothing!
but... Can't you make new armour?
I thought bears were good at that.
there's all this metal around. -- Worthless!
my Armour is made of sky iron, from the falling stars that land in Svalbard.
a bear's Armour is his soul, like your daemon is your soul.
irreplaceable. 'May as well take him away and replace him with a dog.
it must have been terrible to loose your Armour.
I was no less than I deserved.
I am in exile. I was sent away from Svalbard because I was unworthy.
I fought another bear in single combat and was defeated.
come child. We can't involve ourselves.
he was prince.
he would have been the king, if the other bear hadn't defeated him.
he lost everything. Oh Pan, it really hurt him.
lorek Byrnison.
be careful. -- I know where your armour is.
they tricked you out of it.
they shouldn't have done that, lorek Byrnison.
it's in the District Office of the Magisterium, right here, in Trollesund.
what's your name child? -- Lyra Belaqua.
then Lyra Belaqua, I owe you a debt.
I will serve you in your campaign, lorek! lorek Byrnison!
listen. Don't fight these men. What they've done ain't right, I know.
if you fight them, you'll kill them, and then there will be more fighting and we'll never to saving those kids.
just not be too hasty. The way I see it, there's no need for a dust-up.
howdy lorek. I was down South when l heard you ran in to some local trouble.
didn't have the first notion on how to spring you.
fortunately little girl come in resourceful up in these parts.
well look at here. Reinforcements.
what do say you fellows just call it a day.
just been hired on by these gentlemen of the Gypsian persuasion. Figuring on joining this turkey shoot?
Yes. I have a contract with the child.
that's some pretty fast work, Miss Lyra.
my Lord...
rise, Fra Pavel!
I have received your news about the Gypsian party heading to the North.
the matter is of the first importance.
they must be illuminated, and Bolvangar protected.
the intercision process is more important than ever.
which is why it must be taken out of the hands of the Coulter woman.
it was Mrs. Coulter who took the Belaqua-child from Jordan College, and then let her slip away.
Yes, that is the most troubling of all.
no matter. One way or another, it is better that I've sent Mrs. Coulter after the child.
you've sent her? - Yes.
she is to demonstrate the improvements to the intercision-process upon the Belaqua-girl.
I'm sorry.
I would never hurt you.
Oh, Lyra.
I'll find you. I will find you.
careful there, boys. Airship machinery is kind of finacy.
but she was ever so clever, Mrs. Coulter.
but she was always telling me what to do.
I bet you don't like it ether. I can tell.
you're like my Uncle Asriel.
he's a classic noble like you. I think...
Samojede Lands.
samojedes don't take kindly to trespassers.
it's the only way to reach Bolvangar.
stay close to me.
come child. -- It will be dark soon.
what's wrong? What can you see?
where are we going? They told us not to leave the tents.
lorek? -- What is it, child?
the alethiometer keep telling me something.
in the next valley there's a lake with a house by.
it is troubled by a ghost.
it's something to do with the Gobblers. And Roger.
you can take me there.
you could carry me there and back before anyone knew couldn't you?
you wish to ride me? -- Yes.
we will travel faster without armor.
are those birds? -- Witches.
more than I have ever seen. -- Where are they going?
flying to war.
if they are flying to the aid of your enemies you should all be afraid.
are you afraid? -- NO.
when I am, I will master my fear.
I will make sure the way is clear.
no, stay here.
Lyra no. Please don't!
something's wrong. -- Hush, Pan.
something terrible. I'm afraid.
we've got to master our fear.
Hallo?
Hallo?
Billy. -- Where's his daemon?
he doesn't have a daemon.
that's... Intercision. That's what the Gobblers do.
cutting away kids' daemons.
Where's my Ratter? Have you seen her?
Billy, It's me, Lyra. Let me take you back to your mum.
I need Ratter. -- Billy come on with me.
we'll take you some place safe. We'll find Ratter.
gracious God, What's this?
Lyra child, what have you found?
Billy. Billy Costa.
you're alright Billy. You're safe now.
pan, where are they taking us?
I don't know. We've been going for hours.
ice bears, Pan.
I hope you're happy now.
don't worry. We'll get her back.
the samojedes won't lay a hand on her, she's more worth in one piece.
I'll find her. I'll bring her back. I can bargain with Ragnar.
I'll drop you at the border. I'll pick you up when I come back.
no. I will not leave her.
if you show up in Svalbard, Ragnar and the rest of them will tear you to pieces, you know that.
I know that I would feel ashamed to show less pride than that child.
that kind of courage can get you killed.
I will not live in shame any longer, Scoresby.
I recon not. Let me take her down. Pick up the trail.
don't worry. lorek will come.
that's just it Pan. There's to many for him to fight.
we've got to do something.
do you remember what Mrs. Coulter said?
about the King of the bears wanting a Daemon.
pan, I need you to hide. Don't let them see you.
that's fine by me.
we can beat him, Pan.
what is this little thing? -- All greetings to you, Great King.
or rather: My greetings, and not his.
not whose? - lorek Byrnisons, Your Majesty.
what have you to do with lorek Byrnison!?
I'm lorek Byrnison's daemon.
how has the exiled, the unworthy lorek Byrnison obtained a daemon!?
lorek Byrnison was the first bear to receive a daemon, but it should have been you.
they gave me to him at Bolvangar. Mrs. Coulter did.
how can you be so far from him.
I'm like a witch's daemon, Great King.
I can go as far from him as I please.
well... If you are his daemon, then I will kill you right now and be free of an enemy!
if you do that, I can never be your daemon.
my daemon?
that's why I come here, see.
cause I want to be your daemon, not his.
he's just an exile, nothing.
but you: You're powerful, and clever, and rich, and better in every way.
he's on his way here now to fight you.
what? He's mad. We shall destroy him!
no. If you defeat him l will become your daemon.
but you must defeat him in single combat.
and all his strength will flow into yours.
and my mind will flow into your mind.
you and me together.
have him killed any other way, I'll just go out like a light, and you'll never have me.
prove it. Prove to me that you are a daemon.
ask me something only you know.
how did I become king?
what is that? -- It's a daemon mirror, Great King.
we daemons use it to see the truth in our own eyes.
truly you are great and powerful, Ragnar.
you poisoned the old king, and challenged the heir to the throne, and beat him in single combat.
lorek Byrnison.
Oh Pan, what have I done?
ragnar is too strong.
what if the coward dare not fight me. -- Great king, let me speak to him.
if I do he will not suspect. -- Very well. You go to him.
give him courage.
bring him to his death.
soon You'll be mine.
Oh lorek. lorek, I've done a terrible thing.
what terrible thing?
I told the king l was your daemon.
and that he must fight you.
if not, they would have never let you fight.
the would have burned you before you got up close.
but you've been fighting. And running all this way.
Lyra. Lyra Belaqua.
know I shall call you Lyra "Silver-tongue."
to fight him, is all I want. Come, little daemon.
fight well, lorek my dear.
you're the real king, and he ain't nothing.
Lyra, if I am killed, Scoresby will find you.
is that all?
is that all?
soon to die?
is that all?
is that all!?
Yes, that is all.
bears! Who is your king!?
lorek, I thought I'd lost you. -- Why? You're still on my contract.
now I will take you to Bolvangar.
we've got to stop them, lorek.
the alethiometer says they'll hurt Roger.
it may not hold us both.
you cross on your own, I will follow.
I'm right here. Step quickly, don't look down.
don't look back, you're almost there!
run Lyra, Run!
Lyra, I will get Scoresby and the Gypsians.
wait for me there. Lyra, Wait!
I don't like the look of this place.
Bolvanger! - Hello there.
I got lost in the snow. Where am l?
no need to worry my child. You're safe now.
you better come inside. It's warm and comfortable here.
what's your name. -- Don't tell him who we are.
Lizzie. Lizzie Brooks.
odd that you're so far north, Lizzie. There must be an interesting story.
my dad and uncle, they took me. They're traders.
well, you're very lucky to have found us when you got lost.
what is this place? -- Oh, you'll like it.
it's called the experimental station. -- What do you do here?
we help children grow up. -- Liar.
you must be hungry Lizzie. Lucky you, just in time for dinner.
can you see him? Is he here?
Lyra, it's them! -- Pan, you found us!
you kept your promise.
I knew you'd come. -- I promised, didn't l?
Roger, do you know what they do to the kids here?
well they say they're gonna give us this operation, right?
then they'll send us home. And we don't have to worry about Dust.
but once they call a kid in, you'll never see them again.
they took Billy Costa away last week. And he's still gone.
don't worry. I've got a plan, alright?
tell the kids to have their warm clothes ready.
I need to be alone somewhere.
but not here.
they hardly ever use this one. But be quick.
ask it how we are gonna get out of here.
but why would it... -- Oh no. It's them.
have you discover how several children managed to wander free from the station.
I hope you understand, the question is mute.
any child who escapes the facility, would not last very long in the cold.
we have already recovered 2 out of the 3 missing children.
where they alive?
well that is unfortunate...
I, at least, have some good news.
we needn't be concerned with Lord Asriel any longer.
he's bribed his capturers and set up a secret laboratory in the far reaches of the North.
the Magistiriums soldiers are on their way.
he will be arrested for heresy, and sentenced to death.
to death? Oh dear me...
I think I will retire for the evening.
Oh well, of course Miss.
the order will show you to your chambers.
I wouldn't get on the wrong side of her I'll tell you that.
she's positively goolish.
remember the first experiments?
she was so keen to see them pulled apart.
her and that mutually daemon.
what was that? -- Don't know.
you can't! You're not allowed.
quickly now. Straight into the chamber.
let me go!
lorek Byrnison's gonna kill you.
don't be afraid, my dear. It's only a little cut. -- You'll never keep us apart!
you wanna grow up, don't you.
well, this is how you grow up. Stay away from me!
you'll never keep us apart! Never! Never!
no stop! Lyra! -- Pan!
Lyra!
don't! Don't you touch!
no one is going to hurt you. No one is ever... going to hurt you.
they did it to Billy. And to those other kids.
Why? Why are they doing that?
I know it's difficult to understand, but it's for their own good.
it's just a little cut...
a long long time ago, some of our ancestors made a terrible mistake.
they disobeyed the authority.
and that is what made Dust come in to the world.
and ever since then, we've been sick with it.
been sick with Dust.
but there is a way out.
you see, Dust doesn't settle on innocent children.
it's later. When your daemon begins to settle.
the Dust begins to swarm all around us, working its mixture.
and that is how children begin to have all sorts of nasty thoughts and unhappy feelings.
but there is a way to stop it.
a little cut... and gone forever.
if it's so good, then why didn't you do it yourself?
why didn't you let them do it to me?
I'm going to tell you something.
something very important, something you don't know.
intercision isn't perfect yet, and you're not just anyone, Lyra.
your mother didn't die in an airship accident as you were told.
she wasn't married to your father and even though and even though she loved you very much,
and she wanted to keep you... It wasn't allowed.
so you were taken from her, and it wasn't until things changed... and she was free to do as she wanted...
that she went to Jordan College and spoke to the Master.
No! You can't be!
Yes, Lyra. You're mine.
and you're safe with me. You'll always be safe with me.
who's my father?
lord Asriel? He's my father, isn't he?
Yes. Yes.
now I almost forgot.
the Master of Jordan gave you something, didn't he?
he gave you an alethiometer, didn't he?
that wasn't really his to give.
must have seemed like a puzzle, what a silly, old thing like that was any good for.
alright.
here it is.
thank you.
what a funny old tin. Did you put it in here to keep it safe?
run! Lyra, let's go!
go on then. Go on.
lorek!
run child!
better not touch me. I'm warning you.
Serafina Pekkala.
Mrs. Coulter! Get her out of here!
well come on!
Mr. Scoresby, Help lorek!
we're going home!
Lyra, we've got to go! It's time to go home.
I can't Roger. I've got to go to my father and bring him the alethiometer.
your father? - Lord Asriel.
Mrs. Coulter and them, they're gonna kill him.
then I'm going too.
you said you was gonna come get me. You got me.
miss Lyra! Are you ready to fly?
I know where she's going.
well, they're all tugged in back there.
that little girl's something, huh?
there's a prophecy about that child, Mr. Scoresby.
she will decide the war which is to come. -- War?
I ain't heard a rumor of any war. -- You will.
it is your war too, whether you know it or not.
what would the quarrel be about? -- Nothing less than free will.
the Magisterium not only seeks to control everyone in this world, but every world, in every universe.
they've been unable to extend their power until now, but if Asriel finds a way to travel between worlds, nothing will stop them from trying to take over.
nothing but us. And that child.
what's it telling you?
it's telling me about my father.
it's telling me, I'm bringing him what he needs.
we're going home, aren't we Lyra?
after we save your father?
of course. Except first we need to sort out some things that need sorting.
I feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy.
what did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me.
what, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forest...
we can talk, sir. - Oh, I see. So is it personal?
no, you intimidate them.
dear God, you're a woman! I honestly, I couldn't have called that.
I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here?
I thought of you as a soldier first. - I'm an airman.
well you have actually excellent bone structure there. I'm kinda...
having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?
it's OK, laugh. Hey!
sir, I have a question to ask. - Yes, please.
it is true you went 12-for-12 with last year's Maxim cover models?
that is an excellent question.
yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else?
you're kidding me with a hand up, right?
is it cool if I take a picture with you?
Yes, it's very cool.
I don't wanna see this on your MySpace page.
please, no gang signs.
no, throw it up, I'm kidding.
Yeah, peace! I love peace. I'd be outta job with peace.
just click it, don't change the settings, just click it.
what's going on?
Jimmy, stay with Stark!
lie down!
son of a bitch!
wait, wait, give me a gun! - Stay here!
as a visionary. Genius. American patriot， even from an early age, the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind.
at age four, he built his first circuit board.
at age six, he built his first engine.
and at seventeen, he graduated Summa Cum Laude from MIT. And then, his father died.
Howard Stark's life long friend and ally Obadiah Stane, steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder.
until at age 21, the prodigal son returns, and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries.
with the keys to the kingdom, Tony ushers in a new era for his father's legacy, creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, satellite targeting.
today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry by ensuring freedom and protecting America and her interests around the globe.
as a liaison to Stark Industries, I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot.
he is my friend and he is my great mentor.
ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark!
thank you, Colonel.
this is beautiful. Thank you.
thank you all very much. This is wonderful.
well, I'm not Tony Stark. But if I were Tony...
I would tell you how honored I feel, and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award.
as you know, Tony's greatest strength and biggest weakness is that he is a workaholic.
we should just stay till the morning.
you are unbelievable! - Oh, no. They roped you into this?
nobody roped me into anything. But they told me that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored.
of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you!
that's great. So when do we do it? One more round. - There you go.
there it is. That was easy. I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's OK.
wow, would you look at that? That's... that's something else.
give me a hand, will you? OK, you too.
I don't blow on man's hands.
there it is! It's the Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes' roll, and...
that's what happens.
worse things have happened, I think we're gonna be fine.
color me up, will you? - This is where I exit.
tomorrow don't be late. - Yeah, you can count on it.
I'm serious. - I know, I know.
render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. There you go.
Mr. Stark! Excuse me! Mr. Stark!
I am Christine Everheart, Vanity Fair magazine.
can I ask you a couple of questions? - She's cute.
she's alright? Hi. - Hi.
Yeah. Okay, go.
you've been called the Da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?
absolutely ridiculous， I don't paint.
and what do you say to your other nickname, the Merchant of Death?
that's not bad. Let me guess... Berkeley?
brown, actually.
well, Ms. Brown.
it's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got.
I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, we'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.
rehearse that much?
every night in front of the mirror before bedtime，I rehearse.
I can see that. - I'd like to show you firsthand.
all I want is the serious answer.
okay, here is serious. My old man had a philosophy: Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.
that's a great line, coming from a guy selling the sticks.
my father helped defeat Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project.
a lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.
and a lot of people would also call that war-profiteering.
tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops?
all those breakthroughs are from military funding, honey.
wow, did you ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.
good morning. It's 7 a. m.
the weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.
the surf conditions are fair with waist to shoulder highlines, high tide will be at 10: 52 a.m.
you are not authorized to access this area. - Jesus!
that's Jarvis, he runs the house.
I've got your clothes here, they've been dry cleaned and pressed.
and there's a car waiting for you outside that will take you anywhere you'd like to go.
you must be the famous Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am.
after all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry cleaning?
I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires.
including occasionally taking out the trash. Would that be all?
give me the exploded view.
the compression in cylinder 3 appears to be low.
note that.
I'll try again later... - Please don't turn down my music.
I'll keep you posted.
you are supposed to be half way around the world right now.
how did she take it? - Like a champ.
might've tried to hustle me out of here.
your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.
that's funny... I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there.
I need to speak to you about couple of things before I get you outta the door.
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?
Larry called, he's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings, do you want it, yes or no?
is it a good representation of his Spring Period?
No， the "Springs" is actually the neighborhood in East Hampton, where he lived and worked, not "spring" like the season.
I think it's a fair example...I think it's incredibly overpriced.
I need it. Buy it, store it.
okay... the MIT commencement speech.
is in June... please, don't harangue me about that stuff.
well, they are haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes...
I need you to sign this before you get on the plane.
what are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?
as a matter of fact, I do. - I don't like it when you have plans.
I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.
it's your birthday. - Yes. - I knew that. Already?
Yeah, isn't that strange, it's the same day as last year.
well, get yourself something nice from me. - I already did.
And? - Oh, it was very nice.
very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.
you're welcome, Ms. Potts.
you're good! I thought I've lost you back there.
you did, sir.
I took it across Mojave. - Ah, I gotcha, I gotcha.
what's wrong with you? - What?
three hours! - I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
three hours. For three hours, you got me standing here.
I'm waiting on you now. Lets go.
wheels up! Rock and roll!
What're you reading? - Nothing.
Sourpatch, don't be mad.
I told you I'm not mad, I'm indifferent, okay?
I said I was sorry. - Good morning, Mr. Stark.
no need to apologize. - I told him I was sorry but he...
I'm just indifferent right now.
you don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me.
I respect you. - I'm just your babysitter, and so, when you need your diaper changed, thank you...
let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?
Hey, heat up the sake, will you? Thanks for reminding me.
I'm not talking... we're not drinking, we're working right now.
and you are constitutionally incapable of being responsible.
it would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about the night cup. - Hot sake?
Yes, two please. - No, just...
I'm not drinking, I don't want any.
that's what I'm talking about. When I get up in the morning, and I'm putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize?
I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform will get my back! - Here we go again. I'm not like you.
no, you don't have to be like me. But you're more than... yes you are.
will you excuse me, I'm a little bit distracted here.
no, you can't be distracted right now. Listen to me!
bagram AIR BASE, AFGHANISTAN General.
welcome, Mr. Stark.
we look forward to your weapons presentation.
is it better to be feared or respected?
and I say, is it too much to ask for both?
with that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries freedom line. It's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology.
they say the best weapon is one you never have to fire.
I respectfully disagree.
I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once.
that's how dad did it, that's how America does it...
and it's worked out pretty well so far.
find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves.
for your consideration, the Jericho.
we throw one of these in with every purchase of 500 million or more.
to peace!
Tony. - Obie, what are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How did it go?
went great, looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.
Hey, way to go, my boy. I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
why aren't you wearing those pyjamas I got you?
good night, Tony.
I'm sorry, this is the fun-vee. The hum-drum-vee is back there.
nice job. - See you back at base.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
what did you do to me?
what I did?
what I did is to save your life.
I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left, and it's headed into your atrial septum.
here, wanna see?
I have a souvenir. Take a look.
I've seen many wounds like that in my village.
we call them the walking dead.
because in takes about a week for the balls to reach the vital organs.
what is this? - That is an electromagnet.
hooked up to a car battery. And it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.
that's right. Smile!
we met once, you know？
at the technical conference in Bern.
don't remember. - No, you wouldn't.
if I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.
where are we?
come on, stand up. Stand up.
do as I do.
put your hands up.
those are my guns. How did they get my guns?
do you understand me? Do as I do.
he says: "Welcome Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer in the history of America.
he is honored.
he wants you to build a missile， like the Jericho missile that you demonstrated.
I refuse.
he wants to know what you think.
I think he got a lot of my weapons.
he says they have everything you need to build a Jericho missile.
he wants you to make the list of materials.
he says for you to start working immediately, and when you're done, he will set you free.
no, I won't.
no, he won't.
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.
but they will never find you in these mountains.
listen...
what you just saw... that is your legacy, Stark.
your life's work in the hands of those murderers.
is that how you want to go out?
is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark?
or are you going to do something about it?
why should I do anything? They're gonna kill me, you...
either way, if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.
well then... this is a very important week for you, isn't it?
if this is gonna be my workstation, I want it well lit, I want all of these tools.
welding gear, I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.
I need a soldering station, helmets, goggles, a smelting cup and two sets of precision tools.
how many languages do you speak?
a lot. But apparently not enough for this place.
they speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.
who are these people?
they are your loyal customers, sir.
they call themselves The Ten Rings.
you know, we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process? - Aha.
okay. We don't need this.
what is that?
that's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don't you go break down the other eleven.
what are they doing?
working.
careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.
relax, I've steady hands.
why do you think you're still alive, huh?
what do I call you?
my name is Yinsen. - Yinsen， nice to meet you.
nice to meet you， too.
wow, that doesn't look like a Jericho missile.
that's because it is a miniaturized Arc reactor.
we got a big one powering my factory at home.
it should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.
but what could it generate?
if my math is right, and it always is three gigajoules per second.
that could run your heart for the 50 lifetimes. - Yeah.
or something big for 50 minutes.
this is our ticket outta here. - What is it?
flying the mountain' look.
impressive.
good roll. Good roll.
you still didn't tell me where you're from.
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.
it's actually a nice place.
you got a family? - Yes.
and I will see them when I leave here.
and you, Stark?
nothing.
no.
so you're a man who has everything and nothing.
doesn't look anything like the photo.
maybe he modified it.
the tail doesn't seem right. - Well, too bad.
relax.
the bow and arrow once was the pinnacle of weapons technology.
it allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.
an empire twice the size of Alexander the Great and four times the size of the Roman empire.
but today, whoever holds the latest Stark weapons, rules these lands.
and soon it will be my turn.
why did you fail me?
we're working on it. Diligently.
I spared your life.
is this how you repay me?
it's very complex.
we're trying hard.
on your knees.
you think I'm an idiot?
tell me the truth.
we are working hard.
open your mouth.
what does he want? - You think I'm a fool?
what is going on?
tell me the truth.
we are working on Jericho.
tell me the truth.
we are working on Jericho.
what do you want, a delivery date?
I need him.
he's a good assistant.
you have till tomorrow to assemble my missile，okay? - Yes.
can you move?
say it again.
41 steps straight ahead, then 16 steps, left from the door, four to the right，33 steps, turn right.
where is Stark?
he was here a moment ago.
go find him!
say something.
he is speaking Hungarian, I don't speak Hungarian. - Okay.
what do you know?
how did that work? - Oh my goodness.
it worked all right. - What do I do?
let me finish this. - Finish last powering sequence.
okay.
now! Tell me, tell me!
F 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar.
it should be up right now.
talk to me, tell me when you see it. - I have it.
press Ctrl + I. - Got it.
Enter'. I, 'Enter'. Come over here and button me up.
they are coming!
doesn't need to look pretty, just get it done.
they are coming.
make sure that checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, OK?
we need more time.
okay.
I'm gonna go buy you some time.
stick to the plan!
stick to the plan!
Yinsen! - Watch out!
come on. We gotta go.
move with me. We got a plan, we need to stick to it.
this was always the plan, Stark.
come on, you're going to go see your family again.
my family is dead.
I'm going to see them now, Stark.
it's okay. It's okay.
I want this. I want this.
thank you for saving me.
don't waste it. Don't waste your life.
my turn.
not bad.
how was the fun-vee?
next time you ride with me, okay?
watch it coming up here.
are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them.
your eyes are red.
few tears for your long lost boss?
tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
Yeah, vacation's over.
where to, sir?
take us to the hospital, please. - No. - No? Tony...
you have to go to the hospital. - I don't have to do anything.
I was in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger and the other one... - That's not going to happen.
it's not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.
call for a press conference? What on earth for?
Yeah, Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.
look at this!
I thought you'll be in a hospital.
look at you!
Oh, burger, you had to have a burger.
did you get me one of those?
there was only one left, I needed it.
Hey, look who's here!
ms. Potts? - Yes.
may I speak with you for a moment?
I'm not part of the press conference, but it's about to begin right now.
I am not a reporter. I'm agent Phil Coulson, with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.
that's quite a mouthful. - I know. We're working on it.
we've been approached already by the DOD, FBI, CIA...
we are a separate division with a more specific focus.
we need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape.
I'll put something in a book, shell I? - Thank you.
Hey, would it be alright if everyone sat down?
will you sit down? That way you can see me, and I can...
a little less formal...
don't look at me, I don't know what he's up to.
good to see you. - Good to see you.
I never got to say goodbye to dad.
I never got to say goodbye to my father.
there's questions that I would've asked him.
I would've asked him how he felt about what his company did...
...if he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts.
or maybe he was every inch of a man we all remember from the newsreels.
I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them.
and I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero-accountability.
what happened over there?
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up.
and that is why, effective immediately, I'm shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International...
...untill such a time, as I can decide what the future of this company will be, what direction it should take, the one I'm comfortable with, and is consistent with the highest good of this country and the world.
what we should take away from this is that Tony's back!
and he's healthier than ever.
we are gonna have a little internal discussion and we'll get back to you with a follow-up.
where is he? - He's inside.
that... that went well.
did I just paint a target on the back of my head?
your head? What about my head?
what do you think the over-under on a stock drop is gonna be?
optimistically? 40 Points? - At minimum.
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.
obie, I just... I don't want the body count to be up...
that's what we do. We're iron mongers, we make weapons.
my name is on facade of the building.
what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.
not based on what I saw.
we're not doing a good enough job.
we can do better, we're gonna do something else.
Oh, like what? You want us to make baby bottles?
I think we should take another look into Arc Reactor technology.
Oh, come on. The Arc Reactor, that's a publicity stunt!
Tony! We built that thing to shut the hippies up!
it works. - Yeah, as a science project.
the Arc was never cost-effective. We knew that before we built it.
arc Reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?
maybe. - Am I right?
we haven't had a breakthrough in that in 30 years.
that's what they say.
could you have a lousier poker face?
just tell me, who told you? - Never mind who told me.
show me. - Rhodey or Pepper.
I wanna see it. - Okay, Rhodey.
it works.
listen to me, Tony.
we are a team, do you understand?
there's nothing we can't do if we stick together, like your father and I.
I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads up, okay? But if I had...
Tony, no more of this 'ready - fire - aim' business.
do you understand me? - That was dad's line.
you gotta let me handle this.
we're gonna have to play whole different kind of ball now.
we're gonna have to take a lot of heat.
I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low.
stark Industries， I've got one recommendation. Ready, ready?
sell, sell, sell!
abandon ship!
does the 'Hindenburg' ring any bells?
let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan!
look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!
pepper! How big are your hands?
what? - How big are your hands?
I don't understand why... - Get down here. I need you.
Hey!
let's see them. Show me your hands.
let's see them.
Oh, wow, they are small. Very petite, indeed.
I just need your help for a sec.
Oh my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?
it was, it is now an antique.
this is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future.
I was swapping it up for an upgraded unit and I just ran into a little... speed bump.
speed bump? What's happening?
it's nothing, it's just a little snag.
there's an exposed wire under this device and is contacting a socket wall and is causing a little bit of a short circuit.
what do you want me to do?
put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant.
I just want you to reach in and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out.
is it safe?
Yeah, it should be fine. It's just like an operation, you just don't let it touch the socket wall.
what's Operation? - It's just a game, never mind.
just gently lift the wire. - Okay. - Okay? Great.
you know, I don't think that I am qualified to do this.
no, no, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified and trustworthy person I've ever met.
you're gonna do great.
is it too much of a problem to ask? Cause I really need your help here.
Oh, there's pus! - It's not pus.
it's a plasmic discharge, it's from the device, not from my body.
it smells bad! - Yeah, it does.
the copper wire.
the copper wire, you got it? - I got it.
now don't let it touch...
...the sides, that's what I was trying to tell you before.
okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, you don't pull out the magnet and the end of it. That was it...
...that you just pulled out. - Oh， God. OK, what do I do?
don't put it back in! - What's wrong?
nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest cause you yanked out...
what? I thought you said this was safe! - We gotta hurry.
take this, you gotta switch, real quick. - Okay, okay.
Tony, it's gonna be okay. I'm gonna make this okay.
you gotta touch that to base plate.
and make sure you...
was that so hard?
that was fun, right? I got it, I got it.
nice.
are you okay? - Yeah, I feel great.
are you okay?
don't ever, ever，ever ask me to do anything like that ever again.
I don't have anyone but you.
are we ready?
what do you want me to do with this?
that? Destroy it. Incinerate it.
you don't wanna keep it?
pepper, I've been called many things.
nostalgic is not one of them.
would that be all, Mr. Stark? - That would be all, Ms. Potts.
Hey， butterfingers, come here.
what's all this stuff doing on top of my desk?
that's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad right there in garbage.Is the future of air combat it manned or unmanned?
I tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot's instinct, his insight - that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious and discern its outcome or pilot's judgement.
Colonel, it's... why not a pilot without a plane?
look who fell outta the sky! Mr. Tony Stark.
speaking about manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong.
it's spring break, just remember that.
spring break 1987, that lovely lady, what was his name?
was it Ivan?
don't do that, they'll believe it. Don't do that.
give us a couple of minutes, you guys.
I'm surprised. - Why?
I swear I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon.
I'm doing a little better than walking.
Really? - Yeah.
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.
I came to talk to you. I want you to be part of it.
you're about to make a whole lotta people around here real happy, cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was juicy.
this is not for the military. I'm not... it's different.
what are you humanitarian now or something?
I need you to listen to me.
no, what you need is time to get your mind right.
I'm serious.
it was nice seeing you, Tony.
Thanks.
Jarvis, are you up? - For you sir, always.
I'd like to open a new project file, index as: Mark 2.
shell I store this on the Stark Industries' central database?
I don't know who to trust right now. Till further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server.
working on a secret project, are we, sir?
I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands.
maybe in mine it could actually do some good.
next.
up.
not the boot, Dummy, right here. You got me?
stay put. Nice.
and you, you're no better at it at all. Lift... I got it.
okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?
up.
that's great, don't even move.
you... are a tragedy.
okay, lets do this right.
start mark, half meter back of the center.
dummy, look for light. Stand back for fire safety.
you, roll it.
activate hand controls.
we are gonna start up nice and easy, raising 10% thrust capacity to achieve lift.
and 3, 2, 1.
up two? Alright, step back.
I've been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?
Yeah, everything's... what?
Obadiah's upstairs. - Great, I'll be right up.
I thought you said you were done making weapons?
it isn't. This is a flight stabilizer.
it's completely harmless.
I didn't expect that.
how'd it go?
Oh, went that bad huh?
just because I brought pizza back from New York doesn't mean it went bad. - Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.
it would've gone better if you were there.
you told me to lay low and that's what I've been doing.
I lay low and you take care of all the...
Hey, c'mon. In public, the press...
this was a Board of Directors meeting.
this was a Board of Directors meeting?
the Board is claiming a Post Traumatic Stress.
they are filing an injunction. - What?
they wanna lock you out.
Why？ Because the stocks dip 40 points? We knew this was gonna happen.
56 and a half. - It doesn't matter.
we own a controlling interest in the company.
Tony, the Board has rights, too.
they are making the case that you and your new direction isn't in a company's best interest.
I'm being responsible. That's a new direction.
for me... for the company.
I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that...
Oh, this is great! - Oh, wait! Tony, Tony!
I'll be in the shop. - Hey, hey, Tony, listen.
I'm trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch them.
let me have the engineers analyze that, you know, draw some specs. - No.
no. Absolutely not. This one stays with me.
that's it Obie. Forget it.
alright, well this stays with me then.
go on, here, you can have a piece. Take two. - Thank you.
do you mind if I come down there to see what you're doing?
good night, Obie.
day 11, Test 37, Configuration 2. 0.
for lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety.
if you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college. Alright, nice and easy.
seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity.
and 3, 2, 1.
please don't follow me around with it either cause I feel like I'm going to catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down.
if something happens, then come in.
again, lets bring it up to 2. 5%. 3, 2, 1...
okay, this is where I don't want to be.
not the car, not the car.
it could be worse. We are fine.
okay, we are getting there.
Yeah. I can fly.
Jarvis, are you there? - At your service, sir.
engage head up display. Check.
import all preferences from home interface.
will do, sir.
alright, what do you say?
I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We're online and ready.
start the virtual walkaround.
importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment.
do a check on control surfaces. - As you wish.
test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.
Ah, yes... tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check.
start listening the ground control.
sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed before an actual flight. - Jarvis...
sometimes you gotta run before you can walk.
ready? And 3, 2, 1.
it feels like a dream.
you were talking in your sleep, Than.
lf my house is still there...
come with me.
lt's safe to go back down now. l need your help.
maybe tomorrow.
do you want some apple?
there you go.
lt's nice.
well, at least she's eating something today.
where is my mummy?
do you want...to finish up your milk?
'Pomme " is apple.
lt's apple.
the Swedish father of three last saw his youngest son being carried away after the giant wave devastated the bay at Khao Lak on Boxing Day.
the reunion was a very emotional occasion for all concerned.
even journalists were moved to tears.
found trapped under debris by Thai villagers two miles in from where the wave first hit...
l thought we were going to stay here today?
what about Martha?
you don't think Eve's mother is looking for her?
we haven't heard anything.
that doesn't mean she doesn't have family looking for her.
well, they know where to find us.
we have a daughter.
we have to take her back.
lt's chaos out there.
there are...three temples...four hospitals.
we have to keep checking -- for Christ's sakes, Susan!
someone needs to stay with Eve.
and what about Martha?
who's looking after Martha?
you lost her, you find her. She's dead.
lf that makes you feel better about taking somebody else's child...
well, at...at least l'm not digging in the sand -- looking for what?
do you think she'd hold onto a tree?
do you think Martha would hold onto a fucking tree?
my baby?
she's dead.
you keep digging in the sand, my love, if that's what you want to do with your hands but l don't want to see my baby dead.
Khao Lak?
Khao Lak? - Yes.
this is...?
my village.
live there. Keep boat here.
where is everybody?
all gone. - But your family?
Oh God.
l'm sorry.
his family up in the hill.
they too frightened to come down.
and your little girl?
no.
not yet.
l found my wife. - Good good. Wife good.
okay.
we burn them to free the soul.
Oh shit. Oh -- oh shit.
you're not angry.
you lost your whole family, you're not angry?
not what l want.
how it is.
my family gone.
l try to keep my land. - What do you mean?
every morning when l wake up here, l see this.
other men see it too.
what are they doing?
Hey! Hey!
wait, Ian. Ian.
hey -- hey.
my daughter could be under there.
he's worried about his daughter.
body all gone. Go temple.
no no. She's not dead.
they can't do this. - No one come and stop them.
there has to be a mistake.
there must be -- l'll get someone. lt's a mistake.
you're not listening to me.
l'm trying to get through to the British Embassy.
l want my son evacuated to the U. K. where he can receive specialized medical care.
maybe not strong enough to journey.
no
no, l'm -- l'm going to find somebody.
they want to amputate his leg.
look, James worked for you for years, now...
our travel--?
no. No, there are no papers.
l have nothing.
you don't understand what it's like out here.
we were given a few hundred baht and a toothbrush.
we've lost everything.
please, l'm begging you.
that's too late.
l'll try the embassy again.
Yeah, they want to transfer him in the next couple of hours.
Bye.
l think l found Dad.
lt's a website with photos.
l think it's Dad.
he looks...
it's a temple, about half an hour away.
we don't -- we don't have time. - Half an hour.
lt will take half an hour.
okay.
there are more NGOs out here than news crews.
l'm watching the TV.
l've seen the donations pouring in, but it could be weeks before the money filters through.
l know our remit is education but l can't just sit around when the very basics aren't getting to these families.
l'm talking food, water, mosquito nets.
l'm just asking that you reassign some funds.
no, it can't wait.
why is it that the supermarkets in Phuket are teeming with everything these people need?
l can order lobster in my hotel.
room service could get aid to these people faster.
we're working with the local authorities to get the infrastructure up and running again as soon as possible.
still no rapid deployment team?
we're drafting in as many volunteers with special skills as we can from the U. K. and elsewhere.
l'm in constant contact with London and other colleagues.
and l'm confident that we'll have a significant presence by the end of the week.
however, we're all aware of the scale of this disaster.
there are other countries -- Sri Lanka, lndonesia, lndia that are going to need help, both now and in the future. Okay, thank you.
they're... they're clearing land in Khao Lak.
Yes, l heard that. - Why aren't they still searching -- for people? - Well, l think it's fair -- that they've recovered the bodies. - My -- my daughter could be stuck under debris, lying injured in a ditch somewhere.
the likelihood of finding any more survivors is slim.
lf you haven't found your daughter by now...
l'm sorry. That was -- l'm so sorry.
what do l do now?
Oh Christ.
Hey, Tony?
l need someone to sign off on some paperwork for me.
lf you could apply a little diplomatic pressure, there's crates of supplies just sitting in a flight hangar because the NGOs are still in a meeting to arrange a meeting about a meeting.
and l need to get my hands on them and get out there as soon as possible.
Kathy, there's a protocol to these situations.
screw the protocol.
you haven't been in this situation before.
l can't be sidetracked. My brief is to help British Nationals.
you ever heard of the global village?
l'm doing the best l can.
yeah well, do better!
there are 60 ski suits and 200 tins of baked beans in my office.
lf you think they'll be helpful to someone, please take them.
the Nordic Rotary Club and Rotherham Scouts will be most reassured to know that their donations have been put to good use.
for most of us, this was the holiday of our dreams.
l've lost my fiancé. - l'm so sorry.
on behalf of S.Q.A. Hotels, l can only offer our deepest condolences and reiterate my colleague's statement.
we've been helping those who need to fly home, and liaising with the relevant authorities.
but we're not looking at individual cases at the moment.
no one -- no one could have known a tsunami was coming.
and as such, whilst our sympathies lie with the families, we're doing all we can based on the information that we have so far.
this just isn't good enough.
what are you going to do?
where possible, we will be offering alternative accommodation in our hotels not affected by the tsunami for those who wish to resume their holiday.
you think we want to go on holiday now?
l lost my son here.
well, that was classy. - Don't quote me on it, please.
that's a red rag to a bull.
they're looking for somebody to take responsibility.
who do they want to blame? God?
earthquakes don't just happen, do they?
people monitor these things. There are warnings. There are rumblings, right?
that's volcanoes. - Ah.
why do you think the palm trees are still standing when all the hotels and chalets are just gone like they were barely even there.
l don't know. They were built before my time.
and why are you shaking?
what? - l'm watching you.
haven't you got a wife who's missing you or something?
Yeah, too much.
she wants me home.
Oh no.
no, Chai, no.
you don't need me. Rami or one of the other guys can get you the shots.
no no, this isn't done yet. Remember that guy at the hotel?
we saw him at the hotel the day after we arrived.
l recognized him from press junkets and stuff.
he's an earthquake guy. He's a seismologist.
right.
Simone, East Asia Press. - Simone.
wait wait.
Simone, could you run a check for me on a Dr. Pravat Meeko?
sure.
ladies, and gentlemen of the press
Yeah, l'll hold.
l run an education program through a charity.
we're working with over 600 Thai children in this province.
so far l've been able to track 49 of them.
there are Thai people up in the hills who still need the basics.
they can't go back to their villages because the clear-up hasn't got to them.
so please, come with me. l'll show you.
no no. No.
l got something bigger than that.
lt better be worth it, Nick.
Nick... - Yeah?
okay, Dr. Pravat Meeko, former head of Thailand's Meteorology Department...
what's he doing now?
after 25 years as one of Thailand's foremost ministers, Dr. Meeko took the post of Deputy Director of Public Records in 1996.
that's a graveyard posting.
what the fuck did he do to get dumped there?
love, why don't you go and wait for me?
l don't want you to have to see...
Adam, no.
Oh God.
lt's Dad.
what are they?
Poisson.
what are they?
Oh...
little fishes.
do you want some of your drink?
bubbles.
Bulles.
bubbles.
Bulles.
open your mouth.
now these people are actually from the coast, and they've lost their homes.
maybe you guys can help shame the powers-that-be, into extending their clear-up beyond the tourist resorts so they can get back to their land.
come on up. Just introduce yourselves.
they won't bite.
nice photo. - Uh-huh.
we're missing the story, Nick.
yeah well, let someone else deal with it.
here we go.
bangkok Express, February 12, 1996.
"a false alarm about a tsunami hitting the west coast of Thailand led to mass panic and the departure of many families from their coastal homes. "
he made some kind of recommendation in '96.
where is it?
where is it?
whatever he said, it's not going to be on the net.
what's the Deputy Director of Public Records doing in Phuket, eh?
smiling and saying " l told you so. " - Yeah.
where are we going?
tell her l'll call her back. - Simone.
sorry.
Dr. Meeko?
Nick Fraser.
l covered a couple of your department's press junkets back when you worked for the government.
l'm having a little trouble getting ahold of your report, the one where you predicted a tsunami would hit Thailand。
what did your recommendation say, Dr. Meeko?
and why are you meeting with the very man the government chose to replace you.
Dr. Boonma Polsak?
what matters to me is next time.
next time?
things might be different.
Dr. Meeko
l was up in Khao Lak just after it happened, and l saw things...
l hope l never see again.
are you saying there'll be a next time?
here.
this is where l'm staying.
Mr. Whittaker, this is-- this is Kim Peabody.
l managed to track down your mobile number.
l've-- l've called your office several times.
lt's my son, you see.
he's struggling for his life.
l need my son medevaced to the U. K. now.
what does your consultant say?
that they want to amputate his leg.
l really believe under U. K. care l wouldn't be forced to make the kind of decisions that l am being asked to make here.
phuket Hospital is highly respected.
lt has some of the best medical teams in Thailand.
four days and l've been calling, and l've been asking for this flight for four days.
the good news is London has just okayed a fairly comprehensive care program for those without travel insurance. Did you have any?
l don't know!
l don't know-- my husband did all of that.
you see, it really only applies to those without insurance.
no, Mr. Whittaker, l-l, look, right now, you know, l'm without anything.
l have a phone card and a toothbrush.
perhaps family in the U. K. could-- - My mother, but she's elderly.
James was my family.
look, now listen, l came here with my husband and two children.
l have lost my husband, l will not lose my son as well.
l'll come and see you now.
mark, about Mrs. Peabody, she's asking for immediate evacuation for her and her son. He could die.
Yes, l know -- l know that, but he'll need a medical team on the flight.
l've told her l'll visit her tonight.
no no, l think we should do something now.
right.
right, okay.
what? - We've got a meeting in 10 minutes, temporary mortuary facilities.
fuck. Fuck.
um, l'll be back. l'll be back.
thank you.
l didn't mean to disturb you.
l'm Tony Whittaker.
Yeah, Mom said you were never coming.
this is very bad. Very bad. l'm so sorry...
lf you're so sorry, why can't you get him home?
lf he dies-- - Adam.
Mrs. Peabody...
please have a chair. - No no. l've been sitting all day.
have you got John his flight?
l am working on it.
l'm confident we can do something. - When?
tomorrow night at the latest.
tomorrow night.
all right, l shall hold you to that.
lt's good to hear your voice, Dad.
tell Mom...tell her we'll be home soon.
all right?
where are you staying? - This place just above Phuket.
bit of a trek from the beach, isn't it?
Yeah, that's the idea.
did you see that -- that guy got his kid today?
Swedish. - Yeah yeah.
how great must that be?
Yeah.
l keep thinking if l just look a few more yards, you know, if l-- if l just check one more list.
wouldn't that be something if she just was...?
you know, so you keep looking.
you keep looking, and you go back to the same hospitals and the same temples and the same lists.
and every day there are less and less new people coming in, but you can't give up.
you know, l can't give up. Would you?
would you?
no, if it was me, l'd look.
and l'd look again.
but if l was honest with myself...
l was in this village today just beyond Khao Lak.
this guy-- he's all that's left of his village.
ban Kaw Tai. lt's called Ban Kaw Tai.
lt's completely wiped out.
you know, and he's-- he's working all day on this crappy little shelter, like his-- like his life depended on it, and a water hole.
he's watching these big fuck-off bulldozers coming closer and closer, and he thinks they're...they're after his land.
what?
and maybe somewhere...
they're just going to build right over them.
who?
who's going to build right over them?
l don't know.
l don't know.
get up.
Oh shit.
Hi.
Hi.
you stink.
lt has been said.
are you drunk?
no.
buddha.
picked up backpacking with your friends when you were 18.
you are drunk. - No, l'm not.
this is a tragedy.
run-on lists.
put them down.
you checking your numbers...your stats?
all those drowned guests.
they're clearing land ready to rebuild, all along Khao Lak.
l don't know what you're talking about.
barely been a week... and they're flattening land.
the villagers think they're going to steal it off them.
you should get some sleep. - Who's doing it, Ellen?
l don't know. - You sure?
Yeah. - Really?
Mm-hmm.
cause it's really beautiful there.
lt's not hard to imagine someone wanting to build on it.
stop it. - What?
stop it.
well, l'm sorry.
force of habit.
just looking for a place to lie. - Nick
l'm sharing a room with a farting creature who hogs the shower, snores like a tractor.
he's not fucked up.
he's a good guy.
he's got this baby, must be what...?
l don't know how old he is, but l never asked.
he's about this big.
and he talks to it.
he calls in to speak to his wife every day, and at the end he talks this gobbledygook to this...baby.
what is it that makes men so fucking nuts...about their kids? And then l think, my dad did that to me, once held me in his hands, looked down at me, saw a tiny little piece of him.
how'd you get here, Ellen?
backpacking. l was 21.
and l fell in love with the country.
l got to know the coastline.
l got what l needed to get this job.
got more experience.
came back and l never left.
lt gets under your skin. - Yeah.
Yeah. - Something like that.
no, l-- l can't wait. l need to speak to Mr. Whittaker now.
my son is going to die.
when will he be back?
tell him to call me, please.
mom?
l just-- need a few more minutes.
John's going to die. - Darling, he-- he's not going to die.
he's not going to die. l'm not going to let that happen.
l'll make the right decision for him.
l want Dad.
yeah...
Yeah, me too.
he'll hate us.
he'll know we did it to save his life.
he'll hate me.
he won't, darling.
lt'll save his life.
lizard.
lizard.
can you say that?
they're taking swabs...at a couple of the temples.
for DNA, to help identify the bodies.
we need to do that...if Martha's not coming back...if she's dead.
l was calling home last night when l saw you.
l just needed to hear someone's voice.
l just needed to hear...something familiar, something that hadn't changed.
and l was watching you with her and...
l wanted her to be Martha so badly.
but she's not.
and we have to take her back now.
a lizard.
l'll get her things.
France?
um, parlez anglais?
she'll be fine.
just five more minutes.
there's nothing more we can do.
l just need to know she's okay.
l'm not leaving till l know she's all right.
excusez-moi, monsieur!
no, you're all right. Thanks, though.
do you speak English? - Yes.
Oh, beauty.
are we here?
maybe...
here.
l bring gifts. - Thank you.
from the clean-up team?
no, but it looks like your lot lured 'em up.
some days l think this is the only thing keeping that piece of crap alive. - What's one up from here?
um, mainly fishing villages.
ls it true they're grabbing land from the villagers?
Oh, it wouldn't surprise me.
there's probably about 25 villages up and down this coastline who at one time or another had developers knocking on their door.
this one's the frontline. This one's right next door to paradise.
everyone wants a piece of it.
and the villagers have lived here for so many generations, you'd think they'd have history on their side, but something like this just washes all that away.
doesn't matter if you've lived here for five years or 500.
who are they selling to? The hotels?
Yeah, probably.
that's why the sooner we get them down from the hills and back into the villages, the better.
be careful where you're walking. - Thanks, love.
what's going on?
government.
government?
they're gonna build hotels? Gonna build hotels?
soon, maybe.
Thanks.
do you speak English?
Ah, sure, but this is for Dutch nationals.
Where's the U. K?
um...
someone told me they will be here later this afternoon.
what do we do till then?
uh, l don't know what to say.
l'm really sorry. - Look look, we've lost our daughter, okay? - Yes, l understand.
um, you can take a little bit of spit from me?
uh, l can't-- - Dana, it's okay.
we can do it. - Oh...
thank you. - You like to sit here?
we do saliva.
l specialize in dental identification.
we're asking families...if they could get the dental records of the missing, courier it over here.
lt will speed up the process.
11th of December, 1972.
and you've lost...?
first of April, 1998.
she got hold of a tree.
l've been trying to work out how long she'd...need to hold on for.
an hour, maybe?
do you think a six-year-old...could have held on for that long?
a grown man would struggle with that one.
she might have been able to hold on for 10, 15 minutes, but...no, not for an hour.
not in that water.
here's a number...where we're staying.
my wife...
it's been harder.
he was only telling us the truth.
you think l mind truth? You think l want hope? l don't want hope.
l don't want to think that maybe she'll come back, because she won't and then l am broken all over again.
because you know, l left her with you, Ian. l trusted that.
there was a 15-foot fucking wave! - You let her go.
we were walking back to the hotel room.
l had the keys in my hand -- l don't know what you want me to say.
you want me to say it's my fault? lt is my fault.
l let her go.
lt is my fault. l couldn't...
l couldn't keep hold of her.
lt is my fault!
lt will always be my fault, but l didn't make this happen, Susan.
l couldn't stop this happening, love, l couldn't!
come on.
she was my baby too.
you were the one holding onto her.
Yeah.
when she stopped calling for me, it was you she was shouting for.
and where were you, Susan?
where the fuck were you when she needed you?
l wasn't there.
no, you weren't there.
any of you guys want a break?
nice work.
thank you.
she's saying thank you. Her baby hasn't slept for two days.
l'm gonna hunt for some medical supplies -- if you want a lift?
l'm gonna head off, if that's okay.
Yeah, do you want me to go with?
no, l'm fine. You're best here.
Kathy, could you bring back some more tarpaulin?
bloody hell, lan, you're gonna need a picket fence by the time you're finished.
he knows his stuff -- Ian.
Yeah, give him a hammer and he's happy.
he's always complaining he's stuck too much in the office.
when we first started, that's all he did, worked on site.
he's always been best with his hands.
now we've got 14 men and he hates the paperwork.
he's a Godsend.
Yeah.
Yeah, l guess.
how can you believe?
how can you believe in a God that would do this?
um, l guess l know He can't have a grip on every corner.
why not? l mean, isn't He all-powerful?
lsn't He this-- shining spirit that's meant to look after us?
that doesn't sound like a nonbeliever to me.
well, l don't believe in a God that keeps us all safe, keep the world from harm.
neither do l.
but l do believe He didn't do this.
you know, the world keeps turning and l don't think it's down to Him.
hope-- that's all l've got.
believing in something that can't be proven, but that you're willing to trust is there.
that's what keeps me safe at night.
what, even after this? - Yeah, even after this.
buddhists believe that you're only on this planet for a short life, and that you have to make the best of it.
and if you don't, or can't, then there's always another life.
well, just don't ask me to believe that Martha's gonna come back as a fish or something.
to be honest, logistics has been our biggest problem.
every hospital in Phuket now has a U. K. contact point.
uh, right, l'll leave those better informed to take over from here.
Ah, the press is ready for you.
Yeah, l just want to pop up and see Kim Peabody's boy and let her know the good news.
four, please.
certainly.
Mrs. Peabody, we've managed to secure a medevac flight for your son in the morning.
london were pretty hard with their criteria, but when l explained the situation...
what's he doing here?
l don't know what to say.
l wouldn't have taken you for a Methodist man.
caught me.
baptist mother, Catholic father, that leaves me somewhere in between, l imagine.
you edging any closer to getting that paperwork signed for me?
Ah, l have put in calls to the relevant bodies, but...
Nah, you're okay. Everyone needs to take five once in a while.
but if you do get a chance, l've got some people who would really appreciate a cargo full of plastic sheeting that's waiting to be picked up.
Kathy-- - Okay okay, you've got the night off.
bad day? - What?
well, people normally turn to God if they've had a bum day.
l just needed somewhere to sit and think without
Yeah.
l get that.
l used to flatter myself that l was actually doing something for this country.
but really, l'm just loitering...
like an uncomfortable host at the party, making sure the right people are meeting, that the drinks are going round.
you've been stealing?
l wouldn't call it that.
reallocation of resources.
you'll understand.
come on, l want to show you something.
does it involve you driving?
l got you here this far, didn't l?
lt's an early start tomorrow, Kathy.
come on, ye of little faith.
some are Burmese, working illegally.
most are just poor Thais waiting to get their lives back on track.
home, sweet home.
you lived here?
Mm.
lt's weird, what's lost and what survives.
l'm so sorry.
and this...
God knows whose this is.
they amputated John Peabody's leg today.
Oh God.
l stupidly believed that...if l did what London said...
you can look to someone above, but the buck stops with me.
well, we're all guilty of that.
l've spent nearly half my life believing in...
something, something bigger than me.
today was the first day l suddenly thought, maybe l'm just talking to myself, that there really is nothing.
this is it, just me.
why do you stay here, Kathy?
l mean, don't you have family?
don't you have another life?
no, this is it.
this is my one shot.
so if l've got it wrong...
you know what l realized today?
l'm good at this.
this is what l'm good at-- chaos is my natural habitat.
when l look around at all the pain and suffering and just so much disaster......
to tell you the truth, Tony, if l'm honest......
l've never felt so lonely.
and l've never felt so alive.
l'm having the best time of my life.
ls that terrible?
that this is all my life is?
no.
Yeah.
probably.
you do the best you can.
do better.
sorry.
that's all right. l couldn't sleep.
Where've you been?
l walked from Ban Kaw Tai.
you walked?
as l was walking back...
l felt Martha.
l felt her.
my mind's a bit tapped at the moment, but...
l felt her, Susie.
they found a body.
Hi. Come with me, please.
we've moved some bodies over to the containers.
they offer some protection from the heat.
the body has decomposed.
but l want you to look if you can see anything that might identify her to you.
lf you need anything...
l can't tell.
how do we know?
swimming costume was...
it was pink with these flowers which...
was she wearing flowers?
do you know l've-- l just can't remember.
look again.
let's just, just-- let's stay here, a moment...
if it is our baby.
she's so tiny.
they sent Martha's dental records.
these will help.
how long will we have to wait?
l don't know how much l can get from an initial examination.
but, maybe several hours.
days maybe.
l can call you later at your hotel.
we'll take care of her.
Sa-wat dee kha.
sorry l'm a little bit late. - Oh, no problem.
come, join us. - Thank you.
who's the guy?
Jesus, Nick, you freaked me out.
what's that?
lt's a bar menu.
lt's just a meeting.
he's an associate of someone in our Bangkok office.
hold on.
look.
'Tsunamis: warning signs and precautionary measures.
february, 1996, Dr. Pravat Meeko. "
giant sea waves moving toward the coastline generated by earthquakes beneath the sea.
it can be assumed... - Nick, l really...
...that earthquakes in the Andaman Sea will affect the west coast of Thailand.
lt's all marked up, see?
l've never seen it.
no, you wouldn't have, would you?
because it's confidential.
there's a faultline that runs along the Andaman Coast.
and only half of it blew.
what about the other half?
what we saw on Boxing Day may well happen again.
we listen to the government, Nick. We have to trust them.
lf they say it's fine, it's fine.
recommendations
new building development should be avoided in tsunami impact zone.
Nick-- - They thought it might be coming and they ignored it. Worse, they ridiculed it.
so what are you gonna do?
you're just gonna rebuild the hotels? - Nick!
you're gonna put them right back where they were?
this country needs tourism. We build hotels, bring jobs, bring trade, bring the dollar, the yen, the pound.
but you've got a responsibility to the people too, haven't you?
l also have responsibility to my companies, the people l work for.
Oh.
and what about Ban Kaw Tai?
you gonna build there? On land that's not even yours?
l'm just doing my job. l barely even know where Ban Kow Tai is.
lt's a fishing village, Ellen!
lt's got a population of 1 200.
lt's land that was owned by those villagers for generations.
give me five minutes and meet me upstairs, we'll talk about it.
lf there's anything l can do, l promise l will.
Mm-hm.
look, we have 742 guests missing.
lf l thought any decision l'd made had caused even one of those deaths...
what?
what do you fucking think? Give me five minutes.
can l have a beer, please?
a beer? - Yes, sir.
LAN! lan, quickly!
what's wrong?
look!
Hey! Hey, stop stop!
turn it off! Turn it
there's children here! Stop!
you're going to have to move.
what's he say?
l'm very sorry for your loss.
Kathy! - What?
but this land has been acquired.
by whom?
you have the paperwork for this?
this land belongs to SQA hotels now.
how much are they giving you?
because it isn't enough.
hey hey hey!
ho, okay.
lt's okay, all right.
you all right?
my great-grandfather, he fish here all his life.
my grandfather, my father, my family die here.
l know it's hard, believe me.
but we survived.
okay?
okay?
okay.
you're building on a graveyard.
only fools believe in ghosts.
are you leaving, Ellen?
742 guests.
how many next time?
l hope they sue you from here to Bangkok.
l was with a woman today, she was on honeymoon.
she'd been married for three days.
she said the only thing that made it bearable was that the last image of her husband was him smiling in paradise.
people still want paradise. - Yeah, with a crack running through it.
come on, Nick, look at Bali, California, some of the most beautiful coastlines in South America.
eastern Turkey, most of Japan.
lt's a fragile world, Nick.
Dr. Meeko's recommendations were deliberately ignored by Thai authorities who were desperate to protect the burgeoning tourist industry.
and now the worst has happened.
yet S. Q.A. Hotels continue to ignore the dangers of building on a fragile coastline, and are prepared to grab land from Thai villagers to build even bigger resorts.
s. Q.A. property manager Ellen Webb, says, quote, " We build hotels, bring jobs, bring trade, bring the dollar, yen and pound. " End quote.
she goes on to say that she has, quote, " a responsibility to my company, to the people l work for.
"l'm just doing my job, " she says.
lt's a good story, Simone.
lt's a great story.
you don't need me to rewrite it. Send it just as it is.
well, give me five minutes to tidy it up then, all right?
...working with seismologists from all over the world to ensure loss on this scale will not happen again.
Dr. Pravat Meeko's exit from his position as head of the Thai Meteorological Department in the '90s occurred under a cloud.
he had warned of the dangers of a possible tsunami along the Andaman Coast.
he will head the new committee charged with...
you saw the news?
there's no smoking in here.
you know, my wife just put phone down on me, didn't want me to take the job.
she'll come around.
six years is a long time to be sidelined.
this isn't about me, but to see an early warning system in place.
next time, half an hour can make all the difference.
half an hour after an earthquake happening and every beach can be cleared from here to Sumatra.
thanks for the report.
what report?
better check our emails.
okay.
you had a call.
lt was a doctor-- Dutch, l think.
are you sure?
okay, yeah. Tomorrow.
Thanks, bye.
lt's not her.
the, um...girl had two fillings.
booked you a taxi for 8: 00.
l'm not going.
what's left of Martha is still here.
how can l go if she's still here?
l was just...thinking about when she was born.
l was thinking about...
well just-- remembering her eyes looking out into the world.
do you remember that?
how do we come back from this, Suze?
Oh, l don't know.
we can't leave.
l can't stop thinking about when we flew over here and she was sitting in the space between us.
l don't know...
it was just...
you and me and...
the three of us.
lt's New Year's Eve.
sorry, that's my handwriting, that's " E "
mom? Mom, he's come around again.
excuse me.
How're you feeling?
Hello, my darling.
how are you?
Yeah, a bit better.
Yes. This still sore?
while no one will forget what they've seen over the last six days, out of tragedy has come the most astonishing resilience and strength.
the overwhelming love and care of the many volunteers who have been brought together by this sequence of events, and the extraordinary selflessness and compassion shown by the people of Thailand to perfect strangers has been very very humbling.
l'm proud to have been a part of this.
none of us will go home the same.
okay?
thank you, Tony.
Yeah, a moment. - Did you get all that?
Hi, is everything in order with your...
ticket here? Well, good luck.
Hi, it's Carol, isn't it?
Hi, how are you doing? Hello, and you are--?
let me remember-- it's Anna.
Hannah! l'm sorry.
l broke your camera.
four columns, not bad.
that is a start, isn't it?
so l hear you're thinking of being a real journo when you grow up.
when you coming home?
don't know, l thought l'd stick around a bit.
there's a whole thing with Burmese immigrants here l want to look into.
and then head up-- head down to Acehet...
maybe add a few more columns.
you okay?
yeah yeah, l'm fine.
good.
Suk says come back soon.
you give her my love, will you? - l will.
all right. - Take care of yourself.
you take care too.
all right.

I have to change clothes.
Oh... cut the bullshit? OK.
I'm not a chatterbox anyway.

Yes.
OK, then.

I have a boyfriend.
I even have a baby.

I'll end it all today.

don't you know what that means?
what are you doing?
Hey! Where have you gone? You should prepare at this time.
that's none of your business.
what the hell are you doing?
I am talking with her. Do I have to report to you?
Kyung-ah, come here.
sis...
sis? Damn it! She's your sponsor or what?
I will tell boss about it.
what? Telling boss?
you bitch!
you think I can't?
I'll tell him all you did so far.
what did I do wrong?
let's go.
God, damn it!
you think I can do it or not?
I know you can.
fuck!
let's hit to 5, 000won.
OK, 4000won.
do the same as we did.
dude, don't do that.
wish you bad luck.
open it! Yeah~
this is Doo-il's cookie price.
Doo-il, come here.
Hey, you fucker!
no, that's for Doo-il's cookie.
fuck you! Are you his dad?
I am kind of his father.
you mother fucker!
you two are brothers-in-law then.
fuck! I don't play anymore.
what made you say that?
fuck! Winner always wins.
it's not fair.
how much did you lose? Just 7, 000 won.
he's using tricks.
you better make your son beg outside.
you better make your son beg outside.
Doo-il, tell uncle 'fuck you'.
if you say that,
I will die and make you an orphan.
you bastard!
dad, I am hungry.
what do you expect from a boy whose mother left him...
let's go to Young-woon's place.
Joon-yong, close the shop.
are you kissing the lock? Come on, hurry it up.
Doo-il said he's hungry.
OK, done.
are we going? Yes?
Doo-il!
aunt!
come here!
Hey, Youn-ah's boyfriend! Make a seat for us.
bastard, give me the money you owe me...
sue me.
how many are we? We can't all sit together.
man, move those people back, and move the table too.
use your brain, man.
is your head only for the helmet?
I'll knock off these bastards...
son of a bitch.
sorry, could you move the table?
we've a lot of people.
Ddang-chil, get our orders.
uh... come here. - Come on up, guys.
Ddang-chil, come and clean here.
can we all sit here together?
don't push me. Shit. Go, go other place.
you fucker like a bat!
we pay to eat, not for free.
what is this shit?
pay? Pay my money back first.
let's get out.
let's go.
I set the table for you.
where are you going?
everybody left.
come to 'AIcohol Hurrah' when you close.
are you leav... leaving?
we are leav... leaving, man.
Hey, let's go together.
tend the store. - Are you g... going too?
you can do it alone.
are you going to go out drinking?
we are going to go to another place! Get back in! OK?
bro! Young-woon!
get out of the way.
all the way, looking for Mom!!
shi... shit! It's unfair!
you!
you have to watch your tongue.
who said
you said that, so tell me!
you're saying you didn't beat her?
who said I didn't?
I mean when I beat her on the roof?
shut up, fuckers!
on the roof or elsewhere, you do beat her, right?
you told me, I heard you beat and made her face like this.
Hey, here's your wife's face.
Doo-il, come here!
are you OK? You aren't hurt?
Doo-il, tell me.
dad beat Mom on the roof, right?
let's go to sleep. Your dad is frustrated.
you tell me, honestly.
have you seen dad beat mom?
Yes.
he said 'Yes'.
you tell me, little brat.
not in the room, on the roof!
dad beat mom on the roof?
yes he did.
Doo-il, think...
stop doing it. What's little boy's fault?
he's never seen it, but told you he did.
Doo-il, when did you see?
tell me exact date.
if he said so, that's it.
how can he remember the date?
you never remember!
Doo-il's Mom was the best for you.
live with her then! You can't say that!
this bastard is crazy.
you don't know marriage life.
you should beg your wife sometimes.
you're too stubborn.
you insist black while people say it's white.
I can insist black if I'm right.
I can't agree with what's wrong.
I can't agree with what's wrong.
hurrah Hak-ie.
hurrah Hak-ie.
hands down, mother fuckers.
no, not again.
you can't say 'no' again either.
listen to me, ok?!
you're dead. Mom'll kill you.
what, brat? I'm not late.
behave yourself!
you want to get killed?
chasing woman mak... makes you...
you frustrate me...
make you screwed!
mom, I'm home.
eat supper before leaving.
what supper... no need!
I am leaving, mom.
don't ever come again.
Bye.
busy today?
are you ever interested?
give me, I'll do that. - Don't touch that!
if you like your friends so much, break up with Soo-kyung too.
you're always saying stuff like that.
you've dated her for 4 yrs, and have been engaged for 2 yrs.
I'll marry this year.
it's too late though. Marry right away!
have you washed them clean?
chief!
you feel fresh?
what brought you here?
nothing special, about Kyung-ah...
sit down and take these flowers first.
these are to apologize...
it's my first time giving flowers to a woman.
can you just treat me as a sister?
I tried, but not that easy...
I tried, but not that easy...
I'll move to another bar, then.
you can't say shit like that.
I'm sorry, but I can' help it.
fuck!
OK then. I won't bother you, so don't move.
don't ever show up with your boyfriend.
if I see that, I'll eat you up.
let's see what will happen.
next song is 'Bye-bye'.
Why? I'll give you a tip.
you can push the button...
that's not fun! Next song!
sit down for a sec.
Why?
come here.
when will you marry?
I said I will.
When?!
whenever I'm ready!
ready?
I know it's because of your friends!
if you marry late, it's not good for the baby.
what baby? I can't even take care of myself.
marry her right away!
I'll get you an apartment.
I'll take care of it.
be careful when you ride your motorcycle.
why did you catch the damn cold?
don't need to bother...
I'm good at this.
delicious?
Yes.
tomorrow's Min-gu's birthday...
he'll treat us well. If not, I'll kill him.
you'll bring me there, right?
you should go to school.
will you bring Soo-Kyung instead?
she finishes her work late.
we gather early in the evening.
behave yourself, OK?
what again? Bitch...
never let me notice although you date her. Got it, bastard?
why must she come when
I'm out with the boys?
he's being mean again.
when did I do that?
why are you saying stuff like that?
go marry if you want, but don't talk of marriage in front of me.
how long will you do this kind of work?
if you get me money, I won't.
learn some skills, so I can get you an hair salon after a year.
OK.
stop saying 'OK', just do it.
you put it off for a year already.
you should lead your life.
so, you're giving me a salon, and telling me to fuck off?
no, I didn't mean it that way...
what else could you mean?
I know you will marry Soo-kyung.
but why do you emphasize that?!
I didn't emphasize that!
you think I am nuts?
you keep mentioning Soo-kyung.
why marry Soo-kyung? Not me?
I met her before you...
a year?
then you should be engaged with me if you knew me first.
right.
you said you love me.
knowing someone early doesn't mean anything.
tell me why it must be Soo-kyung as your wife.
when I met Soo-kyung...
it's enough, shit!
she was a virgin? Is it the reason?
no one's virgin these days.
she might be a whore.
you..., fuck!
virgin or whore might be the same for you.
fuck!
you, don't ever call me.
get out!
don't you dare say bad things about Soo-kyung.
fuck you...
live your life as you want!
you want to get screwed?
fuck off, you mother fucker!
I've never seen a crazy bitch like you.
say hello properly, you bastard!
you know I like you.
I'm fucking pissed off.
what make you like that this time?
because of Youn-ah.
I had better end things with her.
she asked me why I don't marry her.
right, what's the reason? I am also curious, bastard.
what?
Youn-ah is best for you.
she's nice, sexy and too good to you.
we think Youn-ah's better than Soo-kyung.
you fucking crazy bastard!
you never gonna leave Youn-ah.
you need her whenever you're in trouble.
you call her when you're sick, hungry, and even horny.
you just pay back my money, fucker!
don't wring money out of woman, bastard!
shit, this rotten bastard!
stop it. Bastards!
Joon-Hee, stop! Here's a restaurant.
Hey! I bring up a gun.
Hey! Put this book back in its place!
fuck you... - Bastard!
wake up! Youn-ah's ready for our meal.
Ugh, stink!
this brat was snoring the whole night.
when did I snore?
where are you going?
I gotta go.
no way!
I broke up with that bitch. I am not going, no.
Hey!
I won't beg you to see me again. So just eat up and go.
I don't want to...
Ugh. Idiot. - Ouch!
let's go eat!
behave yourselves, bastards!
you, sons of bitches!
I love you Young-woon.
ditto, Youn-ah!
Ah... shit!
Oh my goodness!!
cool...
get back to work!
ms Choi, how much do you collect today?
2. 5M won, why?
bring it here.
Hey!
no, if you do that again, I'll be fired.
I see, I won't get you fired. Come on, bring it to me!
I don't have a key for the safety box.
Oh my... these bitches...
ms Kim! Go get Director Lee.
why are you sitting there, not working? Chief Kang!
Lee, get me the key, I'm busy.
what key?
cut the crap, and step aside.
why do you keep my family's key?
don't try to do that. Company is badly off.
you are so funny.
my family goes bankrupt, not you!
shut the fuck up. Just get me the key.
go get approved by boss then!
father's not here now!
I know you're a good worker, I do know!
I will get approved soon, so get me the key!
no, I can't!
Lee! Hey you!
Gee... no...
don't bother me, ok?
I'll be laid off, no...
this crazy bitch... - Ouch!!
hold it tight, dude!
I'm holding, I like you, man!
Wow! Look at this money!
Hurrah!
I hope those lines hold. - Hold on. Hold on, Wilbur.
hold on to the wheel.
I'm sick.
shut that window, Wilbur. - All right, I'm trying.
I'll help you, Wilbur.
Mike, look out.
bloody hell. Get her below, or I'll kill her.
Hey, I was... - I'm telling you!
get her... Get her out of here!
get below! - I'm going.
I don't understand you. I'm going down now.
get below.
Oh, God, not that.
what a hell of a way to spend New Year's Eve.
how did you even find someone like that?
Mike, I told you, I didn't find her, she found me.
she saved my ass the other night in a bar.
two guys were trying to roll me, and she comes up...
...and hits one over the head with a bottle...
...and the other one, she just kicked in that spot where it hurts most.
you should've seen her. You should've been there.
it's okay, it's okay. I caught her act last night.
well, it could've been worse.
remember that spider monkey I brought aboard last year?
sorry.
the only difference so far is the real monkey didn't apologize.
morning.
here. - Good morning.
good morning.
Hey, look, I'm really sorry about last night.
usually I'm totally terrific on boats.
what's this supposed to be? - Coffee.
try again.
listen, ace, it's not exactly the Waldorf down there.
mine's okay, Mike. At least it's hot.
try again.
if I'd known I was gonna be sailing with Captain Bligh...
...I'd have stayed put up in my chateau in the Riviera.
Chateau? Is that what the other girls called it?
Hey, wait a minute. Now, that's untrue and totally unfair.
and absolutely, totally... - I'm sorry, hon.
I really am sorry.
Yeah. I can see you are.
that's okay.
she's a good kid, Mike. Really, she is.
she's just trying to get to Africa.
I know, I know.
but it'd be so much nicer if somehow all of this was someone's fault.
come on now. When we get back to Marseille, you're going to the bank.
you'll extend the mortgage on the boat, that's what you'll do.
Mike, losing your cargo in a storm like that, the bank will understand.
Oh, sure.
in times of real trouble...
...one thing a man can depend on is the sympathy of a bank.
come on, now.
Hey, take a look up there.
chopper, right?
french coast guard.
for them to be out this far, some ship must be in big trouble.
what am I thinking, Wilbur?
tell me. - Salvage.
you're thinking salvage. - Salvage, hell.
salvation.
some poor devil is stranded out there.
get a fix on that chopper's course and we'll follow it back where it came from.
I knew it. I knew my luck couldn't be that bad.
nothing was gonna get worse, because nothing could've.
sorry. - Jesus.
look what I found.
happy New Year. - I'll drink to that.
Oh, my gosh.
all those people. - Yeah, it's a lousy business...
...when someone's gotta die before you can make a buck.
but, you know...
...all that salvage is gonna belong to somebody. Why not us?
I hate to be this big party pooper, but aren't we slightly overmatched?
this thing's gonna get a double hernia trying to haul that thing back into shore.
we don't have to.
not if the French coast guard found a way in.
you're looking at a four-star passenger liner...
...carrying hundreds of wealthy people on a European cruise.
the only kind of salvage I want out of there is the kind I can carry on my back.
and end up with what? A bagful of credit cards and gold fillings?
charming.
a quick trip down to the purser's office.
that's where the money and the jewels are.
maybe even some gold.
in and out and I'll be on my way back.
that was an explosion inside the hull.
maybe it's trying to tell you something.
Mike. - I gotta get in there before it goes down.
I don't know, she could go down any moment now.
the Andrea Doria stayed up for more than 10 hours.
well, I stayed up for a week once. So what?
we're wasting time.
now, listen, I'm going in there by myself.
they're about to take my ship away from me...
...but I've got this chance, and I'm sure as hell gonna take it.
there could be a fortune in there.
and if there is, it's mine.
Wilbur...
...make ready the skiff.
get the monkey to help you. - Monkey?
I didn't know you guys had a monkey aboard.
gee, I didn't see one...
wonderful.
ahoy, Jenny, ahoy. - We've got company.
I'm Dr. Stefan Svevo, and this is the medical rescue ship Irene.
that must be the Poseidon. We heard her S. O.S. Last night.
sheer off. I have the salvage rights here. Captain Michael Turner.
a capsized ship is like a giant air bubble, captain, and there may be survivors.
my paramedics and I could be instrumental in guiding them off.
give them medical attention, if needed. - The survivors have been taken out.
but you can look and take out any you find.
but only survivors.
I will take out anything else that I find. Is that understood?
well, that was my original proposition to you, captain.
good.
then we'll start getting our gear together, and I suggest you do the same.
well, we are prepared to go aboard right now...
...but, don't worry, captain, we'll wait.
sorry, not a chance.
way I see it, you don't have a choice.
how's that?
as I said, I'm in a desperate need to get to North Africa.
you leave me here and sail off without me, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Wilbur, we're gonna tie her up and throw her in the tug.
if you don't come back, I'll die up here.
that is a definite possibility. - Oh, come off it, Turner.
I know you're a tough guy, but you're not a son of a bitch...
...no matter how bad you want me to think you are, are you?
sit down.
ready? - Yeah.
I hope you're a religious man, captain.
I've taken the liberty of saying a small prayer for us.
all of us?
well, it's my feeling that from this time on...
...our fates are necessarily intertwined.
good, then you won't be offended...
...if I remind you of that fact from time to time.
the French coast guard must have cut a hole in the ship.
skipper, I'm telling you, it's a floating time bomb.
hazards of the trade. Let's go.
hold it.
we've gotta find a way down.
like over there, maybe.
where? - There.
take a look, Wilbur.
this will do.
Yeah, this'll do it. Come on.
here, this way.
it's the escape hatch for the engine-room crew.
coming, monkey?
why not?
where are we?
looks like a mess. - It's the gym.
just hold on and help him.
what happened? - The ventilators collapsed.
you got him? - I got him.
come on.
come on, you can make it.
how is he? - He'll be all right.
is everyone else all right? - I'm fine.
okay, we're locked in. No way of getting out there now.
sure there is. There must be another entrance into that engine...
what's so funny, doctor? Let us in on it.
I'm sure we could all use a good laugh right about now.
I find it ironic, that's all, captain...
...that I've suddenly become one of the very people I came down here to rescue.
doctor, that little prayer you said for all of us up there...
...what sort of religion would that happen to be?
greek Orthodox.
greek Orthodox. No kidding?
I'm a Greek Orthodox too...
...suddenly.
Wilbur, switch the steam off.
over here.
are you the rescue team? - We used to be.
last night was the worst New Year's party I've ever been to.
I mean, everything turns upside down.
what a party. What a night.
look, I lost my daughter.
you gotta help me find my daughter. - Calm down, mister. Just calm down.
I'm Captain Mike Turner...
...and I have the salvage rights to this wreck.
now, who are you people?
I'm Gina Rowe, the ship's nurse.
it all happened so quickly. We never knew what happened.
any other survivors? - There couldn't be.
we can't be sure of that, Suzanne.
Mr. Mazzetti, Suzanne and myself...
...we were following some other passengers...
...and we got separated from them...
...and we stumbled into the steam room.
it looked like a safe place, at the time.
it was until that pipe broke. - Look, forget the pipe.
help me find my daughter, I'll give you everything I got.
understand? Everything.
let's just get it out of here, okay? Which way, captain?
we were hoping you'd give us the answer.
Oh, my God.
the rest of your crew, they're on their way down here right now?
no.
those two over there are my crew.
all of it.
just the three of you? - That's right.
what, did you come by canoe?
you, what are you doing down here?
I'm Dr. Stefan Svevo, Mr. Mazzetti...
...and I've been asking myself that same question.
Oh, my God.
my daughter, she hated this trip.
she wanted to stay home for Christmas.
I said, "Honey, I want you to see where I fought the war in Italy. Anzio.
anzio? I've been to Anzio.
Anzio's the pits.
you sound just like my daughter. - Easy, Mazzetti.
how well do you know this ship, Gina?
hardly at all. It's my first voyage.
well, there must be a deck plan around here somewhere.
there's always one in every section.
look, I used the gym a couple of times.
seems like there's a deck plan in the lobby over there.
the ladies stay here.
the rest of you, help me find a deck plan.
through here.
I guess I was wrong. - There it is.
we're here.
here it is. Here it is.
we found it.
you found a way out? - No.
but we found the purser's office.
you're a very single-minded man, captain.
and some would say callously so. - Watch out.
the way I see it, doctor, is that we're all trapped here anyway...
...so I see no reason not to try and get what I originally came for.
here.
look, forget the purser's office. I gotta find my kid.
Mazzetti!
look, I'm sorry, I didn't know. - Neither did I.
okay, so I was stupid.
but somebody's gotta do something. We just can't sit around.
look, she's alive, I know it. I can feel it.
fine. Then you tell us where she is, and we'll all go look for her.
I don't know. - Then shut up and calm down.
we have as good a chance of finding your daughter or way out by heading for the purser's office as anywhere.
and that is through there. Now let's go.
after you, skipper. Come on.
keep on moving, that's my philosophy.
I really don't see that there's any alternative.
we're putting our faith in you, captain.
what, you're putting your faith in him?
an hour ago, he's sunbathing up there on the poop deck.
now he's down in this underwater coffin...
...trapped with the rest of us, that's how smart he is.
you.
you haven't come forward yet. You look like a reasonable man.
what do you say we throw in together?
we'll find my daughter and get the hell out of here.
may I see the deck plan, please?
well, I'm afraid my knowledge of ships and underwater conditions...
...falls far short of Captain Turner's.
but I am flattered, Mr. Mazzetti, that you'd feel safer being with me.
but at the moment, at least, I'd feel much safer being with the captain.
and, captain, I'm at your service.
well, I don't seem to have a choice anymore, do I?
by the way, Mazzetti, what rank were you in the war?
if it's any of your business, master sergeant.
good. Then you'll be used to taking orders from captains.
move it out, sarge.
here it is, the purser's office.
Wilbur.
take this...
...and hold those wires back.
do you ladies think you could jump this?
well, it can't be more than 6 or 7 feet across.
when I was the captain of my college track team...
...often times, you know, we'd dig this pit...
well, it can't be much of a jump, can it? - Speak for yourself.
when I was in the Girl Scouts, I once won a medal for the running broad jump.
how many tries they give you? Best of three?
show them how it's done, Gina.
take a run at it.
look, if you miss, Gina...
Mr. Mazzetti, would you hold that for me, please?
please, call me Frankie.
take a run.
all right, Gina.
come on, sarge, join us.
don't worry about me, Turner.
my dress. I don't think I can make it. - Take it off.
I beg your pardon? - Take it off.
he's got a real way with words, doesn't he?
with apologies, madame. Givenchy? - It's a copy, actually.
should we be fortunate enough to get out of here alive...
...I'd be very happy to replace it with the real thing.
Oh, God, hold me, please. - Oh, brother.
I'm okay.
are you gonna be all right? - As soon as you make it. Go.
well, I can't, Wilbur, I can't.
I can't make this jump unless you're on the other side...
shut up, the pair of you, and one of you jump.
right. Wilbur. - Hold the wires back for him.
come on.
just a minute. Take a run.
okay. - Okay.
I have the shortest legs of any of us. - Shut up and come now!
okay, here I come. Are you ready? - Yes.
okay.
that's a hell of a track team you belonged to.
actually, my specialty was the discus.
get out of here. - I was good at the discus.
the safe, do you see?
coming, doctor? - Well, I've been thinking, captain.
we'll separate into two camps.
we'll go aft...
...and you and your party continue forward.
is that an order?
hopefully it's a constructive suggestion.
all right, doctor, we'll play it your way.
Hey, look, we're wasting time.
this ship could blow up or go down any second.
we gotta find my daughter.
she could be anywhere. - Mike.
look, she's not here. Let's look somewhere else.
think we need the plastique? - I don't know.
did you ever live with a safe cracker? - Absolutely.
of course, I didn't know at the time.
she's not in the safe, I can tell you that.
are you all right? - I'm fine.
that's okay, Mike, don't worry about me. I'm just fine too.
well, what do you know.
now, that's one way to crack a safe.
where do you think you're going? - Let's not wait around for the cops.
1796. - How much you think they're worth?
a hundred times its weight in gold.
bort.
what? - Bort.
what's that? - Industrial diamonds.
how much are they worth?
Oh, I'd say 3 to 400, 000 dollars' worth.
now, wait a minute. Tell me the truth, is this really ours?
Yeah, the law of salvage.
pack up and let's get out of here.
can you see us now, Mike? Can you see us along the Riviera now, huh?
why, we're rich.
you know what? We don't need a bank anymore, do we, huh?
no bank for us anymore. We're filthy, stinking...
great, great. So you're all rich.
puke, son.
that's fine Saint-Emilion, 19 and 61.
whole ship's rocking pretty bad, ain't it, captain?
how you doing, Tex?
well, I gotta confess, I've had smoother crossings in my day.
name's Dewey Hopkins. I'm from Big D, Texas.
that's Dallas, folks.
with your permission, captain, I'd like to buy the house a round.
much obliged, Tex, but we're here on a pretty tricky, salvage operation.
I'm Captain Mike Turner, this here's Wilbur and Celeste, my crew.
how you doing? - Pleased to meet you.
tell you what, Captain Mike.
you just salvaged yours truly out of this here wreck.
there's 100, 000 in it for your trouble.
I can't take your money, Tex.
anyway, I don't need it now.
well, as one man of substance to another, let's go right to the mat.
I mean, let's not pussyfoot around.
a hundred and fifty thousand for the three of us.
they're with me.
there's nobody there, sport.
you're seeing double. - Triple, maybe.
they must've got lost.
Hey!
Hey, come on out here, y'all...
...and get yourselves rescued.
Theresa! Theresa! - Daddy.
Oh, thank God.
thank you.
would somebody catch this, please? - My baby.
thank God.
thank you. - I didn't think I'd see you again.
I love you, baby.
he knew she was alive somewhere. He just knew it.
Oh, my baby. - Daddy, this is Larry Simpson.
he saved my life.
I was coming down in the elevator and the ship turned over.
I was operating it. - My baby.
we tried to get out, but the passageway was on fire.
I fainted, but he pulled me out.
my baby. Look, look, kid, l...
I'm never gonna forget you for this.
here, here. Your dress is torn.
all right, folks...
...let's wet ourselves down for safety's sake...
...and get this herd on the road for home.
here.
wrong year?
wrong time, Tex.
all right, now, we've found what we wanted.
each one of you fill a bag with gold or diamonds and carry it out.
everyone gets 10 percent of what they carry.
diamonds.
look, we don't want your filthy loot around our necks.
just get us the hell out of here.
well, perhaps just a few.
ten percent of this will pay off the balance on my folks' farm.
maybe buy me one too.
you, a farmer? - I will be if I get out of here alive.
look here, Mr. Hopkins.
we've all gotta have our wits about us from now on...
...so as they say in Dallas, drop the bottle, Tex.
what I'm a-holding here means more to me than...
...any two bags of that trash you got there, captain.
why this is a original Beaune, 1865.
maybe only six of them left in the whole world.
now I'd a whole lot rather drink it out in the daylight...
...but one way or another...
...It's a pleasure no man's gonna deprive me of.
all right, Tex.
if disaster strikes, I'll try and give you a couple of minutes warning.
okay, everybody, let's...
Where's Suzanne?
probably in the powder room. - Suzanne?
Suzanne?
Suzanne?
Suzanne?
she's gone, Mike.
what do you mean, gone? - Gone. Split. Disappeared.
she could've gone off with Svevo. Who knows why?
I sure wish I did.
hazards of the trade, kid. Hazards of the trade.
anyone else feel safer with Svevo?
who's Svevo?
as a matter of fact, who the devil's Suzanne?
all right, let's go, then.
Mike. - That's a beautiful bottle.
that's a beautiful bottle of wine.
actually... - Young lady, let me...
odd years. It doesn't really have the bite, but I much prefer the body, you know?
I surely do.
young lady, I most certainly do. - Yeah.
you ever been to Texas?
no, not I myself. But I had a great-granddaddy who died at the Alamo.
the Alamo? - Yeah.
well, do tell. - Yeah.
Hey, monkey, come on. - Yeah. Coming.
Stefan?
Stefan?
Stefan?
Oh, thank God.
well, doctor...
...aren't you even going to say hello?
here.
Stefan, I'm petrified. Please, can we just get out of here as quickly as possible?
it took two years to put this thing together.
I mean, do you really believe I can get off without it?
I've done everything you wanted.
and now I just want to get out.
I...
I understand.
would I have gotten aboard if I could've avoided it?
but since I'm here, since we're both here...
...we've got to see this thing through.
besides, I don't have an option, do I?
no, but I do.
captain Turner, at least he's looking for a way out.
well, the choice is yours, Suzanne.
one must do what one must do.
Stefan, I'm sorry.
and I'm sorry too.
good luck. - And you.
Doyle.
kill her.
finish her.
Wilbur, is anybody hurt?
okay up here. Keep moving.
all of you, keep going.
quick, move down.
through here.
quickly, through here.
Wilbur.
keep going, skipper. I'll catch up with you.
Mike?
Mike? - Coming.
Jesus Christ.
what should we do? - Start moving furniture.
all right, all right, let's pitch in. Come on, kid, give me a hand.
get the wino to help you. Nothing personal.
move. - Here, got it.
Wilbur, what's taking so long?
Wilbur?
what do you think you're doing?
bag of gold. I lost it. - The hell with the gold.
let's get out here. - Let me get...
get out.
you crazy old man, you...
I'm sorry, Wilbur.
is it that bad?
I'll come along. Go on up there with the others.
like hell I will.
I don't want them to see me like this.
not Celeste, anyway.
it'll pass, Mike.
believe me, it'll pass. It always does. - Sure, sure.
I think my body's trying to tell me something.
you don't have to pretend to me, Wilbur.
I know what you've got.
I've been to see that doctor you're always sneaking off to.
you went and saw the...?
what's his name?
Bernheim.
well, I guess there isn't much we can do about it, is there?
of course there is, Wilbur.
as of this morning, we have all the money we need for an operation.
do you think you can stand? - Don't help me.
I can stand better than you...
...for an old man.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry. - God.
Mike. Mike.
who are you, ma'am? - I'm Hannah Meredith.
this is my husband, Harold Meredith.
how do you do? - It's all right.
you two seem to have taken all of this very calmly.
I mean, why didn't you try to escape?
in our case, it seemed safer just to stay right here.
we couldn't risk being separated outside.
well, I accept the sentiment, ma'am...
...but at this particular point, I strongly recommend you come along with us.
it'd be very difficult for us to get out.
well, I'm gonna have to tell you, ma'am...
...that where we came in is blocked off.
the explosions. - That's right, and there could be more.
I'm staying here. - No.
look, I'm not gonna be a burden to everyone, I...
I'm blind.
I'm not going to leave the cabin without my husband.
Hannah, if you find a safe way out, you can come back.
without me, you'll have a better chance. - No.
look, I don't mean to be cruel, and I'm sorry...
...but I think Mr. Meredith here has a point.
daddy! - Shut up, sarge.
what do you mean? How much time do we have?
we got an hour? He'll slow us down.
if it's more than an hour, I'll come back and get him.
that's very perverted reasoning. - Frank, you're a creep.
you heard Meredith himself talking. - Shut up.
he'll slow us down.
I'll be dead. I don't wanna die. - Shut up. All of you.
they're both coming with us. I leave a single soul alive on this wreck...
...I'll throw out my title to the salvage rights.
Oh, that's crap, and you know it.
I'd bet it that you would testify against me.
now, let's shove off, Meredith.
I'll carry you if I have to.
I can carry my own weight, thank you.
Hey, hey, take it easy, Pops.
sorry. And it's Harold.
mind the step, darling.
everything's different, remember, because the ship's upside down.
can you imagine that man talking to me as though I were a piece of salvage?
you're luckier than you think, Mr. Meredith.
salvage is my business.
I'll walk along with you. - I'm the ship's nurse.
let's have another look at that deck plan.
I think I must have given it to what's-his-name, Dr. Svevo.
he must still have it.
what the hell were you ever sergeant of, Mazzetti?
the Lost Patrol?
come on.
all right, we know what we're looking for. Let's find it.
this could take hours.
damn hull could go down at any second.
unless we get out of here alive, it's all for nothing.
I'm gonna find a way out. - You do what you're told.
I know the way out. I've got the deck plan.
Doyle's dead.
she killed him with an ax.
there's a trail of blood down the passageway.
should I go after her? - No, she won't get very far.
I need you here.
the crate is marked Sprague Pumps. Find it.
wires. Here.
turn sideways. - Turn sideways.
they're behind you.
there's fire here on the right.
why don't you turn this way. - Hey, we don't need any more help.
keep moving. - Daddy, he's just trying to be nice.
look, we don't need nice.
hold it. Hold it.
I smell grub. Hurry on up, folks.
move on out and I'll lead the way.
good Lord, Tex.
no place for a foot race.
hot dang it.
would you look at this.
son of a gun. He sniffed it out.
well, some folks got a nose for water.
me, I got a nose for food and oil.
you know, bet there's all kinds of vittles around here if we wanna look for them.
Hey, Tex. - Yeah?
can that educated nose of yours tell me where the tunnel leads?
no, sir, captain, it sure can't.
in that case, all of you take a rest and I'll go find out.
I'm going with you.
I can crawl into smaller places than you can.
no, monkey.
Thanks, Wilbur.
this way.
here. Here. - Thanks, kid.
here, get something for yourself.
look.
it's no use.
it's blocked solid.
we're gonna have to...
Hey, we'll find another way out.
it's all right. It's simple. - I know that. I know that.
can't a person just come in here and sit down and cry, for goodness' sakes?
I mean, why do you think I wanted to come in this tunnel?
God, this is not a good day for me.
honestly, you just don't understand me at all.
understand you?
I don't even know who you are.
I'm Celeste Whitman.
Hi. - Hello.
I came to France a year and a half ago with my boyfriend from Cincinnati.
Where's your boyfriend now?
Cincinnati.
how about those three husbands of yours?
Oh, I was never married.
of course, I could've been married if I'd wanted to be, a million times.
millions and millions of times.
there's no doubt about that. None. - There's no doubt about it. None.
I mean, I can do anything that I set my mind to do, you know? I mean anything.
I have this very high IQ, if you hadn't noticed...
...and, I don't know, I'm just sort of this underachiever.
underachiever?
you're the toughest monkey on this ship.
monkey? - Yeah.
you call me monkey. That's cute, that's really cute.
you call me monkey.
I hate that. I hate to be called monkey.
I mean, maybe it would've helped if I wore my long black evening gown...
...but then, I packed it away with all the rest of my summer things.
Oh, I wanna get out of here. - Celeste. Celeste.
Celeste. - What?
I think you're beautiful.
you do?
you gonna kiss me now?
no.
well, then let's just get the hell out of here.
come on.
Yeah, we're walkin'. Yep.
nice to meet you, Mr Darin. - Thank you very much.
Bobby, we've got an AP interview tomorrow...
ap interview? - It's only two minutes.
it's my night with my wife and kid, for us to experience it.
it's only two minutes. That's all I'm asking.
it's my one night I don't have to do that. It's my anniversary celebration.
you missed them in Florida. We can't avoid 'em.
man: Good luck, Bobby.
Bobby, have a good evening. - Thank you.
Hey, Charlie.
and now, ladies and gentlemen, tonight, celebrating his 10th anniversary in show business, the Coconut Grove is proud to present the one, the only Bobby Darin!
thank you.
three guesses.
wrong.
stop! Stop! Richie, stop! Stop!
hold it!
OK, I want to start over. I want to do it again.
you're kidding me. That was perfect. - I want to do it again.
I can do it better. - Know how long it takes to set this up?
I don't know how much more my chops can take today, boss.
when you start playing it right, we can all call it a day, but when you play it sloppy like you been doing, then we're gonna do it again and again until we get it right.
Bobby, the guys are tired, that's all. - How do you think I feel?
call it.
ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna let you leave in a minute...
Whoa! Please stay in your seats until Mr Darin has left the set.
thank you. Can we have the bell up, please?
Bobby, we can't keep doin' it over and over and over.
if Bobby says he can get it better, then he can get it better.
what the hell's he snapping at everybody for? - Just let him walk it off.
mr Darin, do you want to start from the very top?
Hey, Bobby, you know we've got press on the set today, can you give 'em a few minutes?
crew: Ready to go in ten minutes.
and no-one is discarded.
how you doin'? - I don't know, Charlie.
Ah, you'll figure it out. C'mon, let's go back upstairs.
put those two pieces together. I'll look at 'em after lunch.
mr Darin? David said I'd get a few minutes today.
do you mind if we do this now? - He's busy.
nobody's ever done something quite like this, about their own life.
sure, they have. It's a self-portrait on film.
think you can be objective about your own life?
listen, this guy was raised to always tell the truth, and that's what he's doing.
I'm sorry, who are you? - I'm his brother-in-law.
so you mess with him, you mess with me.
I'm not messing with anyone, sir. But being honest, isn't the real truth he's too old to play this part?
he was born to play the part and you damn well know it.
get outta here!
Thanks, Charlie. - That's just crap!
how can you be too old to play yourself? C'mon! Let's get started.
OK, everybody... I want to change the opening.
what? - Why, Bobby?
we can't start with Mack, we blow our wad too soon.
opening with Mack is brave.
it says, "You want me? Fuck you! Here I am.
no. It's wrong.
let's just do Hello Young Lovers. - Bobby, start when you got sick.
Nina, it's his story. Let him work it out.
no, no, no. I know what's important here.
everything starts when he got sick.
Uh-uh... - Nina, please. Don't.
no, I think we should start when they booed me off the stage.
nobody's gonna come see you get booed off the stage.
stick with the hits. That's what sells.
how do you know what people will come to see, Boom-Boom?
when did you become the big expert? - You tell him, Bobby.
as long as I've known you, as far as you're concerned, I am the expert.
boy: Bullshit!
who was that? - That's the kid playing him as a kid.
get down from there, kid. CREW: I'll sort this out.
we're not ready for you yet. - Take five.
wait. I wanna hear what he has to say. - Jesus Christ!
what did you just say, kid?
I said that's bullshit.
what's bullshit? - That you know him better than anybody.
great. A miniature version of you, and he's a method actor.
I need a drink.
he looks just like him. - I know, it looks like him.
I'll be back. DAVlD: Here we go again.
so, you're playing me.
I am you. - You think you got me down?
I know you better than they do.
we could do it 100 times, it'd never be good enough.
it's OK if he yells at me, but not at the other guys.
they've been working their asses off, man.
I've never worked with such an arrogant asshole.
listen, you prick.
there are four people here who can't be fired. You're not one of 'em.
he might be an asshole...but he's our asshole!
look, he finally found himself.
so how do you think we should start?
you want some truth? I'll give you some truth.
BOBBY: The kid is right.
this is how to begin on the street where I grew up, with my sister Nina, my brother-in-law Charlie, and, to me, the greatest in the world - my mother Polly.
Mrs Cassotto, I'm sorry to have to tell you.
BOBBY: Ow. - The boy has rheumatic fever.
CHARLlE: What is it? - It's a strep infection.
but why is it so painful?
doctor: Rheumatic fever damages the heart.
it affects the joints and the muscles, too.
so, what do we do, Doctor? How do I make him feel better?
just make him as comfortable as possible.
POLLY: Just tell us the truth.
you can never go wrong with the truth.
even with the best medical care in the world, the boy will be lucky to see his 15th birthday.
CHARLlE: Come and sit down, Doctor.
POLLY: What are you doing? Come on, Bobby.
silly man doesn't know what he's talking about.
come on, let's get you back into bed.
mama, tell me about my father.
you know all about your father. You just rest now.
but I like to hear you tell it.
well...
Sam Cassotto was an important man.
he was a cabinet maker, but then he started working for another man.
who was a gangster? - Walden Robert Cassotto!
he was a businessman.
I thought you said you could never go wrong with the truth.
all right, he was a gangster.
but he never did anything for this family.
but your father, Sam Cassotto, he was a loyal and good man.
and he would've been so proud of you.
keep the noise down, all right? I want it to be a surprise.
don't wake the kid, see?
Hey!
you wake my kid, I'm gonna stick that horn up your fat ass.
you hear?
y'know, before your sister was born, this is what your mama did for a living.
music opened a whole new world to me.
no matter how bad I feel, no matter how sad or sick I am,
I just touch these keys and "Poof!," Iike magic, I always seem to feel better.
I've always known you had talent, Bobby.
this piano is for you. Charlie worked hard for it.
see, God wouldn't have made you suffer so much if he weren't gonna make up for it later.
mama was right about music.
it opened a whole new world to me, outside of time and illness.
a world I could live in.
I knew then if I could live to 10, maybe I'd make it to 15, and then maybe 20.
from then on, music was the most important thing in my life.
mama taught me all the moves and dances from vaudeville that made the greats stand out.
I would spend most days in bed with fever but when I had the strength, Mama and I would practise, and practise, and practise, until we created what she called "The Plan ."
soon I would be old enough to head to New York, but Mama had one more lesson to teach.
from the halfway mark!
to be a star, a big star, you've got to be talented, obviously.
but you got to be tenacious, have charisma.
but most importantly, you gotta have...it!
the great intangible.
and you've got it all, Bobby.
you're gonna be bigger than Sinatra.
I'd settle for a little Jolson. Mama, Mama, Mama.
so part of Mama's plan...
young BOBBY: Wait a minute. - What?
you didn't go dancing down the street like that.
I know. It's a fantasy sequence.
but it's not real. - Forget real.
listen, kid. Memories are like moonbeams.
we do with them what we want.
Oh. OK, then.
go on. I'll be around when you need me.
mama's plan was to surround myself with the best.
so I now had a manager who had never managed.
steve Boom-Boom Blauner, a public relations guy who had never related to the public - David Gershenson.
Behrke, who had only conducted the high school band, and my brother-in-law Charlie, a garbage man, as my valet.
not in the school band now, huh, Bobby?
let me tell you, when you come from nothing, like us -- like him.
then you're destined to make a name for yourself.
and we will, Richie, we will.
drive over there. Drive over to those friggin' girls. Go on.
go on! Hey, girls, do you wanna see a real star?
while Sinatra was playing at the Copa, Walden Robert Cassotto would play any place they would book him barmitzvahs, weddings, and a few dives on Long lsland.
Hey, kid, you ain't no Sinatra. - Stop. Stop.
they're lazy. They don't like to rehearse.
they don't get better. They're wasting my time.
it's only the Safari Club. - I don't care!
we know three songs, they can't keep pace with two of them.
Bobby, you didn't know what F sharp was, now you're an expert?
Bobby, you called the Safari Club a disease.
you guys sounded great. - No, we sounded like shit.
the audience deserves better.
I had a hot head, a weak heart and an even worse stage name.
Walden Robert Cassotto isn't a name you could see on a marquee.
well, maybe for one night only.
one thing most performers were doing back then was to find a great stage name.
and then one day, I saw it.
the perfect name.
just blinking. Darin.
Darin. Bobby Darin.
and no sooner did I change my name that I got my first gig on television.
unfortunately, I didn't know the lyrics to the song, so I had to devise my own method to get through it on live television.
didn't win me many fans.
but it didn't finish me either.
my record company was giving me one last chance to make a hit.
Bobby, it's all about the image.
are you starting again? It's my last session.
you look like shit. - I know my hair is falling out!
next time you go on television, wear one.
that looks so goddamn fake. - John Wayne wears one.
very authentic. Humphrey Bogart wears one.
Bogart has an album coming out, does he? - Sinatra wears one.
all right, Boom-Boom, you win.
I'll go back to making the vinyl and the records, and the putting the wax in the thing and making it go.
let's sing the song again, hello.
CHARLlE: Does this song make any sense to you?
it takes place in a toilet. It shouldn't.
maybe he should be in the shower.
guys don't take baths. - I agree.
I put the tow... Wait, wait. I wrap the towel around me, and then I jump back in the bath.
how comes he jumps back in the tub?
doesn't he know these people? - Where else should he go?
we gotta play with it. - Play, but just keep it to an hour.
that's all the time we got, Bobby.
Hey, tell me something.
who's this guy, Yom Kippur, they got booked on Friday?
what are they screaming?
I finally topped the charts with a song I wrote in 20 minutes.
now, listen carefully to the lyrics. They're very profound.
# Reelin ' with the feelin ' - Look at that!
he said he'd do it, and he did it.
Charlie, I'm trying to hear him sing!
he's going to be the biggest star in show business.
ma, get away, I can't see.
what's that on his head?
what is it? - It's a toupee. One of those.
I was a teen idol for about a minute and a half, but Mama's plan was to be bigger than Sinatra.
I wanted to do the great standards, but my producer thought I was nuts to turn my back on rock'n 'roll.
teenagers aren't going to buy an album of you doing standards.
Ahmet, how do you know what teenagers will buy?
what, you got a crystal ball back there?
I know you don't change your image when you're hot like this.
you know what? I don't want teenagers to be my only audience, so that's perfect.
why can't you be satisfied? You just did Bandstand!
bandstand's mostly for kids. Ahmet, I want the Copa.
with rock'n'roll, I'm like a thousand other guys out there.
I gotta prove I can sing. I want it all.
I want the major leagues. I want nightclubs, Vegas, movies, TV.
this album will make it happen all fast.
you don't have to prove anything. You're a star already.
is that what you think, Ahmet? - Of course!
hang on a second. Hey, kid! Hang on a second.
kid! Kid! - I don't have time for this, Bobby.
what's up? - I've a question. Will you do me a favour?
will you look at me? - What?
just look at me.
do you know me?
what? - Do you recognise me?
what are you talking about? - Do I look familiar to you?
no. You don't. I don't know you.
leave me alone, crazy bastard. I got things to do.
Thanks, pal.
Ahmet, when the delivery guy knows me, then I'm a star.
give her the real thing. - Yeah!
Bobby, you're to remember this number.
any time, if you need me, no matter where you go, you call.
you have to answer it. You have to tell what happens next.
Hey, Nina. How's it going? - Honey, I gotta tell you something.
what?
go ahead.
you have to go.
don't worry about me.
I can't.
you have to.
mama, I think this is what we've been looking for.
host: And here he is, the greatest - Bobby Darin.
best New Artist. Best Album. Bobby Darin.
Bobby Darin, this is your life.
let's go make movies!
so with success, Hollywood came knocking.
I flew to ltaly with Charlie and Nina to make a movie with Rock Hudson and Sandra Dee.
what is wrong with you, you stupid wop?
there's things in there that break!
Oh, my God. I'm sorry. - Nina, just cool it.
no, I'll do it myself.
BOBBY: Look who's on the cover of Screen magazine, Charlie.
no, just... - Nina, we're gonna take a walk.
CHARLlE: This is a movie. - You bet.
can you act? Charlie, I've been acting my whole life.
one, two, three.
Ah. - What did you wish for?
it's not good luck to tell.
I hope you get what you want.
Oh, that sure is sweet of you.
cut! Great.
OK with that?
that's lunch. We'll move on after lunch.
Hey, Sandy? - Hm?
what do you say you and me have dinner tonight?
no, thank you. I'll have dinner in my room and then go to bed early.
Oh, my goodness, how can you stand all that excitement?
I'm not here for excitement. I'm here to work.
maybe you should go to sleep early, too. - How do you know I don't?
Sandra Dee, have you been spying on me?
I have never worked with somebody so unprofessional in my life.
have you ever even acted before? - Well, I'm learning.
but, blondie, you're not exactly Audrey Hepburn.
OK, people, that's lunch. One hour.
poo-poo, how you doin', boy?
the name's Pom-Pom and she's a girl.
sandy, don't let that little cupcake ruin your make-up.
Mary, there's something I don't understand, you'll have to explain it.
what?
how is it possible that you are Sandy's mother, not her sister?
Oh! Mr Darin.
no. I'm serious. Look at the two of you - side by side, you're mirror images of each other.
honey, when you smile, just make it a really soft smile.
keep your lips a little... That's good.
there she is, Charlie, the girl I'm gonna marry.
I want you to find me a florist, a good one.
I want to send 1 8 yellow roses to her hotel suite every day.
no cards. She 'll know who they're from.
I'll give it a week, maybe less. It won't take that long for Mary to cave.
Mary?
you're gonna send roses to the mother?
you always make sure the mama dog likes you before you go near her puppy.
Mary ain't no Rin Tin Tin.
she's a tough broad with a star to protect.
you're gonna get yourself in a lot of trouble.
Charlie, this is trouble I can handle.
Yourflorist is gonna make more out of this movie than you are.
I know you want to act convincingly and everything, but in the front of your mind, think, "What are my lips doing now? Where are my teeth?
sandy and I just got off on the wrong foot.
if I could just get her away from her mother.
just imagine, Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee.
we have a photo shoot in less than an hour.
I want you to wear the dress the studio sent over from Paris. Don't forget the belt.
that's it. I'm gonna start all over. Like we've never met.
only this time I'll romance her the best way I know.
Hello, Sandra Dee, I'm Bobby Darin.
I believe we're making a movie together. - Hello.
sandy, we have to go now.
I have an interview.
tell 'em you met Bobby Darin and he's gonna marry you.
come on, Pom-Pom. Nice hat, Mr Darin.
I think she likes me, Charlie. - The mother?
that's a different story. - She's just doing her job.
what job is that?
steering her daughter clear of guys like you!
Yeah, well, guess what, Charlie?
mama's job just got a whole lot tougher.
Yeah. That's my boy.
so, Mr Darin, I've read that you think very highly of yourself.
well, Miss Duvan, I'm a man who was raised to believe that you should have a plan in life.
so once I've set my mind to achieving something, that's it.
would you excuse me for a second?
she has a slight cold.
you know, Miss Duvan... Mary...
I just think your daughter's absolutely terrific.
I just think she's the most wonderful thing on earth.
but she's still only a child.
what you need is an older woman.
I just wanna be friendly with her.
we're doing a movie together, she acts like she don't even like me.
give her time. She's not very comfortable around strangers.
Mary, I got an idea. Why don't you let me take her out?
on a date? - No, no, for publicity. One time.
I'd never let her do anything like that.
Mary, think about what it would mean for the movie.
one time? - One time.
well, maybe we can do something.
for publicity.
I swear undying fealty to thee, Sandra Dee, Queen o' the Hop.
and I pronounce thee, Sir Splish Splash.
arise, Sir Splish Splash. - How was that, guys?
Whoa! - What about Rock Hudson?
rock Hudson's great. Isn't he great? - He's great.
I say we ditch these clowns. - What?
as soon as I say "run," run. - You like it here?
terrific. - You plan on more films together?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
run. Run!
Hey!
are you OK?
I can't believe I just did that.
God, you're beautiful.
come on.
you OK? You look kind of pale.
Oh, no, I'm OK. I just kind of run out of gas sometimes, that's all.
it really makes you think, being in a place this old.
I mean, people have been living here and loving here, struggling, dying, for thousands of years.
and now you and I are here.
so, what kind of things do you like?
well, I can think of one right now.
really. - Oh, OK.
Erm...Iet me think.
a great melody.
seeing somebody do something better than anybody else in the whole world.
ice cream. A good book.
what about you? What kind of things does Sandra Dee like?
Er...Iong walks on the beach.
crossword puzzles.
empty studios.
Elvis. - Hey.
just making sure you're paying attention.
I'm paying attention, trust me.
you know, I was right about you.
right about what?
you're gonna be easy to love.
may I have this dance, Miss Sandra Dee?
I would be honoured, Bobby Darin.
Oh, you son of a bitch!
I felt sorry for you and you betrayed me.
Mary, I think you're overreacting.
I said you could take her out sightseeing. For publicity.
I didn't say you could marry her! - Mother!
we are only engaged.
you, come with me!
Sit!
you... You don't even know how to comb your hair without me.
you don't know how to dress without me, walk, talk to people without me!
I'm the one who brought you into this world. I created you.
you'd fall apart in 1 5 minutes without me.
Oh, Mother, please.
when the time is right and you're ready, we will find a husband for you who is suitable...
what's going on?
no, I love him! I love him with all my heart.
Oh, he's a loser. - No, he's smart and he's funny.
I wish you'd concentrated more on Rock Hudson.
rock Hudson is a very nice man, Mother, but I'm not in love with him.
he still would have been a better husband for you than Bobby Darin!
why can't you let me make a decision on my own?
I don't even want to talk about this any further.
we're leaving.
him or me?
fine.
give her to me. Give her to me!
Mary! Mary! Wait, wait, wait a minute!
Nina, stay out of it!
it's none ofyour business!
Nlna: Mary! I wanna talk to you!
you gonna plan to have any kids?
show us the ring!
have you set the date yet? - Marriage is such a big step.
we'll wait before rushing into anything. Right, honey?
right. Absolutely.
we are definitely gonna wait, gentlemen. Absolutely.
OK, there.
Bobby. - OK.
this...Is your home.
no...
I don't mind having a few friends around every now and then, and when your mother comes around, which she finally will, why, she'll be welcome too.
but for the moment, I think it should be exclusively us.
mr and Mrs Bobby Darin at home.
sandy?
Hey, where'd you go?
did you go in here already?
Sandush, where are you?
Hey, baby.
baby, this should be the happiest night of your life.
all right. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on.
I can't. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.
you can't what? - I can't go through with this.
of course you can, baby. - I can't.
Yes, you can. - You don't want to be married to me!
I'm staying married to you until death do us part.
how do you marry somebody that you don't even know?
who doesn't know who? I don't know you or you me?
I don't know if I know you. I know you don't know me.
I know you, you're Mrs Bobby Darin. - No!
it's never gonna work, Bobby. Let's just get out of it now.
no way.
I'll make you miserable. - OK.
do you not understand that?
I don't want to.
I don't want to. I can't help it.
Oh, my God.
what?
I love you.
I really love you.
wait a minute.
wait, don't move. Don't move a muscle.
Oh, God, Bobby, no! Please!
no, honey, honey. It's OK.
I'm not gonna hurt you. It's... Just watch.
my mama used to tell me a story when I was a kid.
that in the Middle Ages, one of the knights in King Arthur's court, he laid down his sword between himself and Guinevere and he promised that he would never cross over to the other side of the bed.
Really?
I am laying down this sword between us.
that's my side of the bed, and that's yours.
and I will never cross over...
ever.
I don't care if we don't touch for a thousand nights.
only you can cross over to my side.
only you.
I can't believe it!
gimme a break.
you look like a dummy.
- That's not my fault.
if it's not your fault, who's running the goddamn thing?
Hi, honey. - Hey, sweetie.
look who's on the cover.
Oh, honey, that's great. Did you see this?
and now, ladies and gentlemen, one time only on our stage:
brash, Cocky and Arrogant.
we ought to use that next time we play somewhere.
Boom-Boom, where are we gonna be in five years?
who knows? The Russians may own show business in five years.
that's bullshit. What about next week, next month, next year?
I can tell you where we're gonna be next month.
don't tell me Detroit.
you know everybody in show business hates me because of the deals I get?
what do you think, guys, is that the reason they hate him?
while we're on the subject of what's next, I almost forgot to tell you.
we're gonna need a new comedian to open for you at the Copa.
what did you just say?
didn't I tell you? You're playing the Copa.
you're friggin' kidding me?
I got the call this morning, big shot. - No, no, no!
we're gonna play the Copa!
we got the Copa!
Boom-Boom, you gigantic genius! Mwah!
goddamned lunatic.
Sandush, I'm playing... Sandy!
sandy, I'm playing the Copa! We're playing the Copa.
my dream has come true, I'm playing the Copa!
that's great, sweetie.
what's the Copa?
the Copacabana's the most important nightclub in the whole world.
everybody famous has played here.
and one day, you're gonna play here, Bobby.
and you're gonna break all his box office records.
you got that?
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!
all right.
george Kirby is the funniest comic working today.
I never said he wasn't funny. I said he was a negro.
he's breaking house records.
if they're a big act, like Sammy Davis, they can headline here, but they never - and you know that - they never open at the Copa.
look, Mr Podell, there's a first time for everything.
why not let one of the great comedians play here?
because I say so. You understand? It's policy.
I understand but, frankly, to hell with policy.
this is 1960, not 1 860.
I heard you had a mouth on you, kid. Save it for singing.
listen, Mr Podell, I respect that this is your club, I truly do.
but if you don't let George Kirby open for me, I can't be responsible for the consequences.
you threatening me? Hm?
I'm cautioning you, Mr Podell. Have you never heard of a sit-in?
a sit what?
it's a very popular form of protest today.
it's where members of the black and the white community...actually, all communities, come together to an establishment that they feel is being unfair to their brothers and sisters.
then the media shows up, they hold hands, and they... they sit.
sometimes for days.
they sit?
Yeah, they sit and erm...
and they sing.
you know, songs like, what's the...?
Oh. We Shall Overcome.
overcome?
overcome what?
Yeah, we're walkin'. Yep.
nice to meet you, Mr Darin. - Thank you very much.
Bobby, we've got an AP interview tomorrow...
ap interview? - It's only two minutes.
it's my night with my wife and kid, for us to experience it.
it's only two minutes. That's all I'm asking.
it's my one night I don't have to do that. It's my anniversary celebration.
you missed them in Florida. We can't avoid 'em.
man: Good luck, Bobby.
Bobby, have a good evening. - Thank you.
Hey, Charlie.
and now, ladies and gentlemen, tonight, celebrating his 10th anniversary in show business, the Coconut Grove is proud to present the one, the only Bobby Darin!
thank you.
three guesses.
wrong.
stop! Stop! Richie, stop! Stop!
hold it!
OK, I want to start over. I want to do it again.
you're kidding me. That was perfect. - I want to do it again.
I can do it better. - Know how long it takes to set this up?
I don't know how much more my chops can take today, boss.
when you start playing it right, we can all call it a day, but when you play it sloppy like you been doing, then we're gonna do it again and again until we get it right.
Bobby, the guys are tired, that's all. - How do you think I feel?
call it.
ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna let you leave in a minute...
Whoa! Please stay in your seats until Mr Darin has left the set.
thank you. Can we have the bell up, please?
Bobby, we can't keep doin' it over and over and over.
if Bobby says he can get it better, then he can get it better.
what the hell's he snapping at everybody for? - Just let him walk it off.
mr Darin, do you want to start from the very top?
Hey, Bobby, you know we've got press on the set today, can you give 'em a few minutes?
crew: Ready to go in ten minutes.
and no-one is discarded.
how you doin'? - I don't know, Charlie.
Ah, you'll figure it out. C'mon, let's go back upstairs.
put those two pieces together. I'll look at 'em after lunch.
mr Darin? David said I'd get a few minutes today.
do you mind if we do this now? - He's busy.
nobody's ever done something quite like this, about their own life.
sure, they have. It's a self-portrait on film.
think you can be objective about your own life?
listen, this guy was raised to always tell the truth, and that's what he's doing.
I'm sorry, who are you? - I'm his brother-in-law.
so you mess with him, you mess with me.
I'm not messing with anyone, sir. But being honest, isn't the real truth he's too old to play this part?
he was born to play the part and you damn well know it.
get outta here!
Thanks, Charlie. - That's just crap!
how can you be too old to play yourself? C'mon! Let's get started.
OK, everybody... I want to change the opening.
what? - Why, Bobby?
we can't start with Mack, we blow our wad too soon.
opening with Mack is brave.
it says, "You want me? Fuck you! Here I am.
no. It's wrong.
let's just do Hello Young Lovers. - Bobby, start when you got sick.
Nina, it's his story. Let him work it out.
no, no, no. I know what's important here.
everything starts when he got sick.
Uh-uh... - Nina, please. Don't.
no, I think we should start when they booed me off the stage.
nobody's gonna come see you get booed off the stage.
stick with the hits. That's what sells.
how do you know what people will come to see, Boom-Boom?
when did you become the big expert? - You tell him, Bobby.
as long as I've known you, as far as you're concerned, I am the expert.
boy: Bullshit!
who was that? - That's the kid playing him as a kid.
get down from there, kid. CREW: I'll sort this out.
we're not ready for you yet. - Take five.
wait. I wanna hear what he has to say. - Jesus Christ!
what did you just say, kid?
I said that's bullshit.
what's bullshit? - That you know him better than anybody.
great. A miniature version of you, and he's a method actor.
I need a drink.
he looks just like him. - I know, it looks like him.
I'll be back. DAVlD: Here we go again.
so, you're playing me.
I am you. - You think you got me down?
I know you better than they do.
we could do it 100 times, it'd never be good enough.
it's OK if he yells at me, but not at the other guys.
they've been working their asses off, man.
I've never worked with such an arrogant asshole.
listen, you prick.
there are four people here who can't be fired. You're not one of 'em.
he might be an asshole...but he's our asshole!
look, he finally found himself.
so how do you think we should start?
you want some truth? I'll give you some truth.
BOBBY: The kid is right.
this is how to begin on the street where I grew up, with my sister Nina, my brother-in-law Charlie, and, to me, the greatest in the world - my mother Polly.
Mrs Cassotto, I'm sorry to have to tell you.
BOBBY: Ow. - The boy has rheumatic fever.
CHARLlE: What is it? - It's a strep infection.
but why is it so painful?
doctor: Rheumatic fever damages the heart.
it affects the joints and the muscles, too.
so, what do we do, Doctor? How do I make him feel better?
just make him as comfortable as possible.
POLLY: Just tell us the truth.
you can never go wrong with the truth.
even with the best medical care in the world, the boy will be lucky to see his 15th birthday.
CHARLlE: Come and sit down, Doctor.
POLLY: What are you doing? Come on, Bobby.
silly man doesn't know what he's talking about.
come on, let's get you back into bed.
mama, tell me about my father.
you know all about your father. You just rest now.
but I like to hear you tell it.
well...
Sam Cassotto was an important man.
he was a cabinet maker, but then he started working for another man.
who was a gangster? - Walden Robert Cassotto!
he was a businessman.
I thought you said you could never go wrong with the truth.
all right, he was a gangster.
but he never did anything for this family.
but your father, Sam Cassotto, he was a loyal and good man.
and he would've been so proud of you.
keep the noise down, all right? I want it to be a surprise.
don't wake the kid, see?
Hey!
you wake my kid, I'm gonna stick that horn up your fat ass.
you hear?
y'know, before your sister was born, this is what your mama did for a living.
music opened a whole new world to me.
no matter how bad I feel, no matter how sad or sick I am,
I just touch these keys and "Poof!," Iike magic, I always seem to feel better.
I've always known you had talent, Bobby.
this piano is for you. Charlie worked hard for it.
see, God wouldn't have made you suffer so much if he weren't gonna make up for it later.
mama was right about music.
it opened a whole new world to me, outside of time and illness.
a world I could live in.
I knew then if I could live to 10, maybe I'd make it to 15, and then maybe 20.
from then on, music was the most important thing in my life.
mama taught me all the moves and dances from vaudeville that made the greats stand out.
I would spend most days in bed with fever but when I had the strength, Mama and I would practise, and practise, and practise, until we created what she called "The Plan ."
soon I would be old enough to head to New York, but Mama had one more lesson to teach.
from the halfway mark!
to be a star, a big star, you've got to be talented, obviously.
but you got to be tenacious, have charisma.
but most importantly, you gotta have...it!
the great intangible.
and you've got it all, Bobby.
you're gonna be bigger than Sinatra.
I'd settle for a little Jolson. Mama, Mama, Mama.
so part of Mama's plan...
young BOBBY: Wait a minute. - What?
you didn't go dancing down the street like that.
I know. It's a fantasy sequence.
but it's not real. - Forget real.
listen, kid. Memories are like moonbeams.
we do with them what we want.
Oh. OK, then.
go on. I'll be around when you need me.
mama's plan was to surround myself with the best.
so I now had a manager who had never managed.
steve Boom-Boom Blauner, a public relations guy who had never related to the public - David Gershenson.
Behrke, who had only conducted the high school band, and my brother-in-law Charlie, a garbage man, as my valet.
not in the school band now, huh, Bobby?
let me tell you, when you come from nothing, like us -- like him.
then you're destined to make a name for yourself.
and we will, Richie, we will.
drive over there. Drive over to those friggin' girls. Go on.
go on! Hey, girls, do you wanna see a real star?
while Sinatra was playing at the Copa, Walden Robert Cassotto would play any place they would book him barmitzvahs, weddings, and a few dives on Long lsland.
Hey, kid, you ain't no Sinatra. - Stop. Stop.
they're lazy. They don't like to rehearse.
they don't get better. They're wasting my time.
it's only the Safari Club. - I don't care!
we know three songs, they can't keep pace with two of them.
Bobby, you didn't know what F sharp was, now you're an expert?
Bobby, you called the Safari Club a disease.
you guys sounded great. - No, we sounded like shit.
the audience deserves better.
I had a hot head, a weak heart and an even worse stage name.
Walden Robert Cassotto isn't a name you could see on a marquee.
well, maybe for one night only.
one thing most performers were doing back then was to find a great stage name.
and then one day, I saw it.
the perfect name.
just blinking. Darin.
Darin. Bobby Darin.
and no sooner did I change my name that I got my first gig on television.
unfortunately, I didn't know the lyrics to the song, so I had to devise my own method to get through it on live television.
didn't win me many fans.
but it didn't finish me either.
my record company was giving me one last chance to make a hit.
Bobby, it's all about the image.
are you starting again? It's my last session.
you look like shit. - I know my hair is falling out!
next time you go on television, wear one.
that looks so goddamn fake. - John Wayne wears one.
very authentic. Humphrey Bogart wears one.
Bogart has an album coming out, does he? - Sinatra wears one.
all right, Boom-Boom, you win.
I'll go back to making the vinyl and the records, and the putting the wax in the thing and making it go.
let's sing the song again, hello.
CHARLlE: Does this song make any sense to you?
it takes place in a toilet. It shouldn't.
maybe he should be in the shower.
guys don't take baths. - I agree.
I put the tow... Wait, wait. I wrap the towel around me, and then I jump back in the bath.
how comes he jumps back in the tub?
doesn't he know these people? - Where else should he go?
we gotta play with it. - Play, but just keep it to an hour.
that's all the time we got, Bobby.
Hey, tell me something.
who's this guy, Yom Kippur, they got booked on Friday?
what are they screaming?
I finally topped the charts with a song I wrote in 20 minutes.
now, listen carefully to the lyrics. They're very profound.
# Reelin ' with the feelin ' - Look at that!
he said he'd do it, and he did it.
Charlie, I'm trying to hear him sing!
he's going to be the biggest star in show business.
ma, get away, I can't see.
what's that on his head?
what is it? - It's a toupee. One of those.
I was a teen idol for about a minute and a half, but Mama's plan was to be bigger than Sinatra.
I wanted to do the great standards, but my producer thought I was nuts to turn my back on rock'n 'roll.
teenagers aren't going to buy an album of you doing standards.
Ahmet, how do you know what teenagers will buy?
what, you got a crystal ball back there?
I know you don't change your image when you're hot like this.
you know what? I don't want teenagers to be my only audience, so that's perfect.
why can't you be satisfied? You just did Bandstand!
bandstand's mostly for kids. Ahmet, I want the Copa.
with rock'n'roll, I'm like a thousand other guys out there.
I gotta prove I can sing. I want it all.
I want the major leagues. I want nightclubs, Vegas, movies, TV.
this album will make it happen all fast.
you don't have to prove anything. You're a star already.
is that what you think, Ahmet? - Of course!
hang on a second. Hey, kid! Hang on a second.
kid! Kid! - I don't have time for this, Bobby.
what's up? - I've a question. Will you do me a favour?
will you look at me? - What?
just look at me.
do you know me?
what? - Do you recognise me?
what are you talking about? - Do I look familiar to you?
no. You don't. I don't know you.
leave me alone, crazy bastard. I got things to do.
Thanks, pal.
Ahmet, when the delivery guy knows me, then I'm a star.
give her the real thing. - Yeah!
Bobby, you're to remember this number.
any time, if you need me, no matter where you go, you call.
you have to answer it. You have to tell what happens next.
Hey, Nina. How's it going? - Honey, I gotta tell you something.
what?
go ahead.
you have to go.
don't worry about me.
I can't.
you have to.
mama, I think this is what we've been looking for.
host: And here he is, the greatest - Bobby Darin.
best New Artist. Best Album. Bobby Darin.
Bobby Darin, this is your life.
let's go make movies!
so with success, Hollywood came knocking.
I flew to ltaly with Charlie and Nina to make a movie with Rock Hudson and Sandra Dee.
what is wrong with you, you stupid wop?
there's things in there that break!
Oh, my God. I'm sorry. - Nina, just cool it.
no, I'll do it myself.
BOBBY: Look who's on the cover of Screen magazine, Charlie.
no, just... - Nina, we're gonna take a walk.
CHARLlE: This is a movie. - You bet.
can you act? Charlie, I've been acting my whole life.
one, two, three.
Ah. - What did you wish for?
it's not good luck to tell.
I hope you get what you want.
Oh, that sure is sweet of you.
cut! Great.
OK with that?
that's lunch. We'll move on after lunch.
Hey, Sandy? - Hm?
what do you say you and me have dinner tonight?
no, thank you. I'll have dinner in my room and then go to bed early.
Oh, my goodness, how can you stand all that excitement?
I'm not here for excitement. I'm here to work.
maybe you should go to sleep early, too. - How do you know I don't?
Sandra Dee, have you been spying on me?
I have never worked with somebody so unprofessional in my life.
have you ever even acted before? - Well, I'm learning.
but, blondie, you're not exactly Audrey Hepburn.
OK, people, that's lunch. One hour.
poo-poo, how you doin', boy?
the name's Pom-Pom and she's a girl.
sandy, don't let that little cupcake ruin your make-up.
Mary, there's something I don't understand, you'll have to explain it.
what?
how is it possible that you are Sandy's mother, not her sister?
Oh! Mr Darin.
no. I'm serious. Look at the two of you - side by side, you're mirror images of each other.
honey, when you smile, just make it a really soft smile.
keep your lips a little... That's good.
there she is, Charlie, the girl I'm gonna marry.
I want you to find me a florist, a good one.
I want to send 1 8 yellow roses to her hotel suite every day.
no cards. She 'll know who they're from.
I'll give it a week, maybe less. It won't take that long for Mary to cave.
Mary?
you're gonna send roses to the mother?
you always make sure the mama dog likes you before you go near her puppy.
Mary ain't no Rin Tin Tin.
she's a tough broad with a star to protect.
you're gonna get yourself in a lot of trouble.
Charlie, this is trouble I can handle.
Yourflorist is gonna make more out of this movie than you are.
I know you want to act convincingly and everything, but in the front of your mind, think, "What are my lips doing now? Where are my teeth?
sandy and I just got off on the wrong foot.
if I could just get her away from her mother.
just imagine, Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee.
we have a photo shoot in less than an hour.
I want you to wear the dress the studio sent over from Paris. Don't forget the belt.
that's it. I'm gonna start all over. Like we've never met.
only this time I'll romance her the best way I know.
Hello, Sandra Dee, I'm Bobby Darin.
I believe we're making a movie together. - Hello.
sandy, we have to go now.
I have an interview.
tell 'em you met Bobby Darin and he's gonna marry you.
come on, Pom-Pom. Nice hat, Mr Darin.
I think she likes me, Charlie. - The mother?
that's a different story. - She's just doing her job.
what job is that?
steering her daughter clear of guys like you!
Yeah, well, guess what, Charlie?
mama's job just got a whole lot tougher.
Yeah. That's my boy.
so, Mr Darin, I've read that you think very highly of yourself.
well, Miss Duvan, I'm a man who was raised to believe that you should have a plan in life.
so once I've set my mind to achieving something, that's it.
would you excuse me for a second?
she has a slight cold.
you know, Miss Duvan... Mary...
I just think your daughter's absolutely terrific.
I just think she's the most wonderful thing on earth.
but she's still only a child.
what you need is an older woman.
I just wanna be friendly with her.
we're doing a movie together, she acts like she don't even like me.
give her time. She's not very comfortable around strangers.
Mary, I got an idea. Why don't you let me take her out?
on a date? - No, no, for publicity. One time.
I'd never let her do anything like that.
Mary, think about what it would mean for the movie.
one time? - One time.
well, maybe we can do something.
for publicity.
I swear undying fealty to thee, Sandra Dee, Queen o' the Hop.
and I pronounce thee, Sir Splish Splash.
arise, Sir Splish Splash. - How was that, guys?
Whoa! - What about Rock Hudson?
rock Hudson's great. Isn't he great? - He's great.
I say we ditch these clowns. - What?
as soon as I say "run," run. - You like it here?
terrific. - You plan on more films together?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
run. Run!
Hey!
are you OK?
I can't believe I just did that.
God, you're beautiful.
come on.
you OK? You look kind of pale.
Oh, no, I'm OK. I just kind of run out of gas sometimes, that's all.
it really makes you think, being in a place this old.
I mean, people have been living here and loving here, struggling, dying, for thousands of years.
and now you and I are here.
so, what kind of things do you like?
well, I can think of one right now.
really. - Oh, OK.
Erm...Iet me think.
a great melody.
seeing somebody do something better than anybody else in the whole world.
ice cream. A good book.
what about you? What kind of things does Sandra Dee like?
Er...Iong walks on the beach.
crossword puzzles.
empty studios.
Elvis. - Hey.
just making sure you're paying attention.
I'm paying attention, trust me.
you know, I was right about you.
right about what?
you're gonna be easy to love.
may I have this dance, Miss Sandra Dee?
I would be honoured, Bobby Darin.
Oh, you son of a bitch!
I felt sorry for you and you betrayed me.
Mary, I think you're overreacting.
I said you could take her out sightseeing. For publicity.
I didn't say you could marry her! - Mother!
we are only engaged.
you, come with me!
Sit!
you... You don't even know how to comb your hair without me.
you don't know how to dress without me, walk, talk to people without me!
I'm the one who brought you into this world. I created you.
you'd fall apart in 1 5 minutes without me.
Oh, Mother, please.
when the time is right and you're ready, we will find a husband for you who is suitable...
what's going on?
no, I love him! I love him with all my heart.
Oh, he's a loser. - No, he's smart and he's funny.
I wish you'd concentrated more on Rock Hudson.
rock Hudson is a very nice man, Mother, but I'm not in love with him.
he still would have been a better husband for you than Bobby Darin!
why can't you let me make a decision on my own?
I don't even want to talk about this any further.
we're leaving.
him or me?
fine.
give her to me. Give her to me!
Mary! Mary! Wait, wait, wait a minute!
Nina, stay out of it!
it's none ofyour business!
Nlna: Mary! I wanna talk to you!
you gonna plan to have any kids?
show us the ring!
have you set the date yet? - Marriage is such a big step.
we'll wait before rushing into anything. Right, honey?
right. Absolutely.
we are definitely gonna wait, gentlemen. Absolutely.
OK, there.
Bobby. - OK.
this...Is your home.
no...
I don't mind having a few friends around every now and then, and when your mother comes around, which she finally will, why, she'll be welcome too.
but for the moment, I think it should be exclusively us.
mr and Mrs Bobby Darin at home.
sandy?
Hey, where'd you go?
did you go in here already?
Sandush, where are you?
Hey, baby.
baby, this should be the happiest night of your life.
all right. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on.
I can't. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.
you can't what? - I can't go through with this.
of course you can, baby. - I can't.
Yes, you can. - You don't want to be married to me!
I'm staying married to you until death do us part.
how do you marry somebody that you don't even know?
who doesn't know who? I don't know you or you me?
I don't know if I know you. I know you don't know me.
I know you, you're Mrs Bobby Darin. - No!
it's never gonna work, Bobby. Let's just get out of it now.
no way.
I'll make you miserable. - OK.
do you not understand that?
I don't want to.
I don't want to. I can't help it.
Oh, my God.
what?
I love you.
I really love you.
wait a minute.
wait, don't move. Don't move a muscle.
Oh, God, Bobby, no! Please!
no, honey, honey. It's OK.
I'm not gonna hurt you. It's... Just watch.
my mama used to tell me a story when I was a kid.
that in the Middle Ages, one of the knights in King Arthur's court, he laid down his sword between himself and Guinevere and he promised that he would never cross over to the other side of the bed.
Really?
I am laying down this sword between us.
that's my side of the bed, and that's yours.
and I will never cross over...
ever.
I don't care if we don't touch for a thousand nights.
only you can cross over to my side.
only you.
I can't believe it!
gimme a break.
you look like a dummy.
- That's not my fault.
if it's not your fault, who's running the goddamn thing?
Hi, honey. - Hey, sweetie.
look who's on the cover.
Oh, honey, that's great. Did you see this?
l want to be a legend.
and now, ladies and gentlemen, one time only on our stage:
brash, Cocky and Arrogant.
we ought to use that next time we play somewhere.
Boom-Boom, where are we gonna be in five years?
who knows? The Russians may own show business in five years.
that's bullshit. What about next week, next month, next year?
I can tell you where we're gonna be next month.
don't tell me Detroit.
you know everybody in show business hates me because of the deals I get?
what do you think, guys, is that the reason they hate him?
while we're on the subject of what's next, I almost forgot to tell you.
we're gonna need a new comedian to open for you at the Copa.
what did you just say?
didn't I tell you? You're playing the Copa.
you're friggin' kidding me?
I got the call this morning, big shot. - No, no, no!
we're gonna play the Copa!
we got the Copa!
Boom-Boom, you gigantic genius! Mwah!
goddamned lunatic.
Sandush, I'm playing... Sandy!
sandy, I'm playing the Copa! We're playing the Copa.
my dream has come true, I'm playing the Copa!
that's great, sweetie.
what's the Copa?
the Copacabana's the most important nightclub in the whole world.
everybody famous has played here.
and one day, you're gonna play here, Bobby.
and you're gonna break all his box office records.
you got that?
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!
all right.
george Kirby is the funniest comic working today.
I never said he wasn't funny. I said he was a negro.
he's breaking house records.
if they're a big act, like Sammy Davis, they can headline here, but they never - and you know that - they never open at the Copa.
look, Mr Podell, there's a first time for everything.
why not let one of the great comedians play here?
because I say so. You understand? It's policy.
I understand but, frankly, to hell with policy.
this is 1960, not 1 860.
I heard you had a mouth on you, kid. Save it for singing.
listen, Mr Podell, I respect that this is your club, I truly do.
but if you don't let George Kirby open for me, I can't be responsible for the consequences.
you threatening me? Hm?
I'm cautioning you, Mr Podell. Have you never heard of a sit-in?
a sit what?
it's a very popular form of protest today.
it's where members of the black and the white community...actually, all communities, come together to an establishment that they feel is being unfair to their brothers and sisters.
then the media shows up, they hold hands, and they... they sit.
sometimes for days.
they sit?
Yeah, they sit and erm...
and they sing.
you know, songs like, what's the...?
Oh. We Shall Overcome.
overcome?
overcome what?

this is the Seoul Broadcasting Station, JODK.
and that was a rooster to wake up our sleepy listeners.
the world's first daybreak broadcast to celebrate the birth of radio broadcasting in Korea.
we'll see you next time.
this is the Seoul Broadcasting Station.
Extra! Extra!
dual language broadcasting!
special rate offer for the opening of JODK!
Extra!
Myung-wol.
how many times have I told you that no one can see your face?
that's because she's not an amateur.
she's professional all over, huh?
come, come now
come pick some mulberry leaves
the hill here, the hill there
it must kill her to not be able to show all of that.
spring has come, spring has come
on the fluttering mulberry leaves
spring has come
spring is here
are you sure it's today?
got a sure tip. Trust me.
what time is it now?
two in the morning.
it'll be here soon.
it relieves tension.
Yes, and the heart has to be cooled.
hell, this damn truck puffs out smoke all the time!
open it up.
damn piece of junk's on fire.
let's get some water.
it's hot.
it's getting angry now, isn't it？
damn, it's getting hotter all the time.
go!
go!
I told you we should've brought a handcart.
quiet. Let's go.
anything useful?
not yet.
look hard.
there must be some important documents from Japan.
I was wondering what do we do with letters exchanged between Koreans?
no harm should come to our own people.
don't burn them.
Comrade.
what about letters Koreans sent to Japanese?
don't burn them.
then how about those sent by Japanese to Koreans?
what about Chinese?
damn, why the hell is it so complicated?
what are you waiting for? Make another basket.
we'll deliver the letters sent by Koreans to Koreans.
Yes, sir.
what kind of a letter is this?
looks like English.
Cali...
California?
you are listening to JODK.
here is the 12 o'clock news.
and again, we don't have anything special for you today.
Oh, why don't I tell you about today's weather?
today will be cloudy and then sunny.
cloud and sun, coming and going.
just like the heart of a woman, if you know what I mean.
the sun will rise from the east and set in the west.
have a great day.
you stink of liquor.
wake Man-chul up.
there's breaking news.
news.
sit tight. I'll take care of it.
come on!
I said I'll take care of it.
breaking news has just come in.
at around two this morning,
the Seoul postal truck was robbed by guerrillas as it climbed over a hill in Mangwoori.
the attackers were four men. They raided the truck when it stopped to cool the engine.
they stole all of the mail in the vehicle.
they also painted Korean emblems on the driver and mailman's foreheads.
will stealing a few letters start a revolution?
instead of starting a revolution, it will bring a lot of heartaches.
most of it is probably love letters anyway.
I can just see couples breaking up everywhere.
don't be so cynical. It's our only news in a long time.
it's in chaos, this world.
I'm just gonna let it be.
hopeless bastards! And they call themselves artists!
it's trash like them that rot our lands.
don't mind them.
they just need an outlet.
anyway, you know that letter from L.A?
it doesn't seem like anything special.
a guy named James sent it. It just says he loves music.
and one day at 4 am, he was listening to the radio and heard the JODK call sign.
someone in America heard the broadcast from Seoul?
is that possible?
look at the postmark. It's from the US.
it's not a fake letter.
you launched our broadcast with a damn rooster!
do you know what is the essence of radio?
telling time.
telling time accurately.
you don't even know the basics.
it's been barely a week. Things will gradually get better.
'Gradually'? Is that all you have to say?
you think this is a joke?
don't you have a program that can captivate the listeners?
what do you do everyday, Lloyd?
you're being a bit too harsh there.
but remember, I made the rooster crow.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
that's your proud achievement? You think that's so big?
well, it's kind of like the Columbus' egg.
seems simple once it's done, but before that it's quite tricky.
don't you talk back to me like that!
boss, why don't we broadcast a recital?
a recital?
you see, in the countryside, people think radio broadcasts are evil spirits' plays.
so we should make it so fun that people lose track of time.
let us first do away with such resistance to radio.
and song and dance is the best way to achieve that.
sir, do you know Miss Marie?
korea's top jazz singer?
what is all this?
this is Korea's first live broadcast of a concert.
and so I thought it had to star you, Miss Marie, Korea's top singing star.
what do you think?
well, I guess you have a point.
who are all these people?
I won't accept having Miss Marie sing without an audience.
I close my eyes
and listen to your voice
close my eyes
to feel the memory
the long shadow of sunset
and the last train
carry this heart of mine
love travels miles
we believed we would last forever
but now
you are away wandering the wasteland
open my eyes softly
to see you once again
I look on at your back, so sad it makes me cry
stop the car.
it's time for the Korean broadcasting.
Marie's live concert is very popular.
more people will buy radios.
and the revenue from subscriptions will increase substantially.
what a sweet voice...
to the radio station.
this radio is the problem.
what?
people are no longer interested in regaining independence.
no one listens to our cries.
they are all listening to the radio.
what's more, this evil radio can reach as far as America.
so?
we take over the radio station.
what?
make a radio drama? - Something that the elite as well as the lowly peasants, men, women, young and old, can all enjoy.
I'm not at all capable. - Then who else?
make it like you made the recital.
excessive modesty borders on arrogance.
but sir, I don't think...
you know what the drama has to deliver, right?
it should exalt the superiority of the Japanese Empire and Emperor.
it should arouse loyalty, but not be too obvious.
and still be very entertaining and exciting!
do you follow me?
boss, why don't you just get Shakespeare to do it?
how long have we been together?
about 10 years.
in those 10 years, none of our attempts were successful.
it's shameful.
but we will be successful one day, Comrade K.
Yes.
we must.
now listen.
we will soon carry out a major operation.
get the lunch box ready when I tell you to.
got it?
Yes. - Yes.
at last, I've met someone who speaks the same language.
please.
I don't think I deserve such a compliment.
could you possibly turn that novel into a drama for broadcasting?
there's no need.
it's originally meant to be for broadcast.
I already feel something hot shooting up my prostate gland.
Ah, a series is the jewel of broadcasting.
what am I saying?
I'm saying if you hear one episode you have to hear the next.
that's the serial addiction, scarier than getting hooked on opium.
a series?
Yes, a series.
you air it every other day or two.
we can have five or six episodes, 20 minutes each.
the average radio drama airs for a full one hour or even two hours straight.
listeners get bored after awhile, and they fall asleep.
and if you study this carefully you'll see that this is all a description of action, not the psychology of the characters.
but doesn't that mean you lack the necessary writing skills?
no, it doesn't.
it means that I'm more talented in writing for radio than some dumb novel.
in sum, I was born to be a script writer!
you see.
that bum, Noh Bong-al.
a bum? He's a writer.
all right, a writer.
well, he used to write comic plays.
which played in some theaters, none of them successful.
and, his wife caught him cheating with an actress.
he's now history, long gone.
in other words, he's a... you know what I mean.
'the Flame of Love'.
in English, can it be called 'orgasm'?
Myung-wol.
why do you keep bowing?
they can only hear you.
how many times have I told you?
now, let's try reading the script for practice, okay?
in Seoul, Jang-hoon falls in love with Arisu at first sight.
my beautiful goddess.
were you speaking to me, sir?
no, don't think of it as acting. Just relax and try again.
Oh my! Were you speaking to me, sir?
much better!
now keep that feel going.
how stupid I was to blurt out what I felt at the sight of you.
I apologize if I have offended you.
I am an educated modern girl.
I'm not afraid to falling in...
it's 'afraid of falling'
you are doing okay.
I am Jang-hoon, the poet.
I am Arisu.
but how playful is fate!
their families were practically sworn enemies.
why is your name not Kim Arisu, but Park Arisu?
miss Marie.
what?
so it's Marie playing Arisu?
you are here. Please do come in.
get ready.
'the Flame of Love'.
miss Marie, you have the lead role, Arisu.
it's a great role I can assure you.
as I said before,
I'm not interested in this kind of thing.
if so, allow me.
now, let's see. Do I start from here?
the Flame of Love'.
you have just become the heroine of the new drama series.
Ajazz star and now a voice actress.
you just got your chance to become a truly versatile artist.
miss Marie.
Congratulations.
Hey, Lloyd. - Yes?
we have an unexpected problem.
what problem? - The narration.
maybe Man-chul can be the narrator as well as the lead actor.
but we also have the night school student.
and the owner of the cafe.
we don't have enough voices for the small parts.
goodness.
why don't you all have a drink?
the first broadcast of 'The Flame of Love'
forced by her determined father, Arisu boards the ship bound for Japan.
Jang-hoon is full of tears as he waves good-bye.
arisu, I will wait for you till the end.
arisu, I will wait for you till the end of time.
my love, I cannot hear you.
arisu, I will wait for you... forever.
my love...
let me start over.
my love, we part today, but we will meet again... soon.
until then, do take care.
and the ship carried Arisu away and away over the horizon.
only after the ship disappeared did a tear shed from Jang-hoon's eye...
raise your hand if you want to order!
Jang-hoon leaves the port and gets on the train for Seoul.
a girl vending coffee passes by.
miss, I'd like a cup of coffee.
the train speeds away from the Busan Port.
how come you have so few customers?
Yeah, it worries me.
as you know, we sell coffee and tea in the daytime and alcohol at night.
so?
there's no business during the day. They all come after dark.
then turn on the radio.
with so little business we can't finance our activities.
the radio doesn't work anymore.
the station has played the same music everyday.
then just yesterday, they aired a ridiculous drama.
that put all my customers to sleep.
and naturally, very little business.
anyway, how are things going?
an opportunity will come.
it always does to the person who prepares for it.
it's strange.
if they read it as I've written it, it should be exciting.
but something's missing.
it's plain. No, it's downright dull.
you scared me.
I know what's missing.
what?
realistic sounds.
what was that?
no, it wasn't me. - Yeah, it was you.
no, I swear!
it's funny. I can't smell it.
Oh my! How did you make that sound?
how? Like this.
we are looking for a master of sound mimicry.
no other qualifications required. Apply now!
seoul Broadcasting Station, JODK.
no qualifications required?
making sounds?
what is an audition?
you, son of a bitch!
you don't own this land!
what was that?
that was the voice of our village chief.
I sounded just like him. - How are we to know if you do?
next!
this is the sound of Maiden Chun-hyang getting flogged.
and what was that?
it is the sound from the bedroom after the lights go out.
why have you come again?
I've brought our village chief.
you, son of a bitch!
you don't own this land!
you, son of a bitch!
you don't own this land!
you, son of a bitch!
you don't own this land!
you, son of a bitch!
you don't own this land!
you, son of a bitch!
you don't own this land!
a frog croaking?
a cannon fire.
a pigeon flapping its wings?
a rain shower. Horses running.
now this is sound mimicry.
okay, let's get ready now.
the first radio series of Korea.
'the Flame of Love'.
Jang-hoon is back in Seoul, after seeing Arisu off.
he walks the streets thinking about the day before.
though I'm forced by my father to leave you to study in Japan,
I will never forget you.
so promise you will not forget me.
I will wait for you, Arisu.
even if you were to go to America, I'd wait for you.
and Tokyo is so near!
only after the ship disappeared into the distance did he begin to shed tears.
because a real man does not let his love see his tears.
I got a job.
Comrade, what are you talking about?
we've been cracking our heads trying to come up with a grand plan.
and you were nowhere for ten long days...
and you got a job?
do you even know how hard it was for us to deliver all those love letters?
Yeah, me too. I can't stand this any longer.
I quit. I'm going back home.
listen to me.
our revolution has to be different from Gandhi's.
ignorant fools.
you wouldn't know Gandhi.
of course we do.
you think too little of us.
I know Gandhi! A revolutionary leader in India.
he starves himself when he's upset.
but do we starve ourselves for independence?
no, we need a strategy that is more aggressive.
'the Flame of Love'.
what is this?
have you been writing novels or something?
I got a job at the Seoul Broadcasting Station.
also known as JODK.
the Japanese took that hill during its first invasion.
now I'm taking it over.
comrades, as you're aware, our operations never succeeded.
perhaps the fault is not entirely our own.
the times changed too fast for us.
so you're saying we should adapt to the times and get ourselves a job?
'the Flame of Love' is the nation's first radio series.
I'm going to take advantage of it to launch a major operation.
how?
arisu, a modern girl, Jang-hoon, a lung-diseased poet, and Young-shin, an old-fashioned girl are in a love triangle.
arisu, who was in love with Jang, is forced by her father to go to a school in Japan.
meanwhile, Jang-hoon stays and starts a new love with Young-shin.
then, Arisu returns from her studies.
the three lovers meet in the streets of Seoul.
what a bastard!
that's what you get for ditching your girl.
the key thing is who he chooses.
how do Jang-hoon and his new girl fall in love?
she nurses the sick Jang-hoon with such devotion.
in the countryside, where there's fresh air.
what an angel she is! - Since they're in the country, shouldn't they start a movement?
what about Arisu?
Yeah, he can't turn his back. That's not the way of a real man.
anyway...
I don't know how it will go because the script isn't finished.
what I do in this program is to make different sounds.
Wow. - Wow.
from now on you are to listen to the drama every day.
the radio frequency even reaches Manchuria and America.
and I'm going to use it to send codes.
then we can connect with a network of organizations across the country.
the code will signal an all-out attack on all the core buildings held by Japan and its army.
let's do it on...
a scale.
Yeah, let's do it on a big scale this time.
but what kind of a signal?
the name of the operation...
the name of the operation is 'The Flame of Love'.
since 'flame' is in the title, there will be a spark.
and the sound of the spark will be our attack signal.
but...
in my opinion, he should choose Young-shin.
I totally agree.
never seen a relationship go right with them modern girls.
wait, what about Arisu? She did nothing wrong.
you don't know what love is.
what do you know about love?
what makes you think I don't?
honey.
Oh, honey, honey. Please, stop.
what?
I can't concentrate.
concentrate?
as if you're doing anything important, you lazy bum.
how could you call your husband that?
consider yourself lucky that I'm letting you be.
for a while you seemed real quiet.
back to your old habits again?
this time it's different.
this is the fist radio series being aired in Korea's history.
how would I know? We don't even have a radio!
and, do you know this time how you'll end it?
you always get fired because you can never finish the ending.
quit it now while you're ahead.
don't go making innocent people into fools like yourself!
this time I've thought out an ending.
Yeah, you must've conned some dumb asses.
well, birds of a feather flock together.
they must be some asses if they fell for you.
be quiet!
I'm so sorry.
but you have very good speed.
speed, a modern concept.
I was curious about something.
where did you learn to make sounds like that?
I just played with some walnuts and it happened.
Oh, then what did you do previously?
nothing much.
traveled around selling things.
well, you know, talent is so mysterious.
we might have it inside us and not even know it.
Ah, and your name is K?
is that a pseudonym?
well, let's just leave it at K.
anyhow, it's very unique and has a nice ring to it.
K, you have made our series so much more real.
and I'm grateful and very happy.
please, help yourself.
in great sadness at parting with Arisu,
Jang-hoon tries to soothe his aching heart with a drink.
he looks on as two of his countrymen fight when a Japanese policeman appears and people start to flee.
what chaos.
someone might get killed.
it was then that Jang-hoon saw her.
a young woman who had fallen among the crowd.
are you all right, Miss?
your legs are hurt.
I'll be fine, sir.
no, I don't think so. You can't walk like that.
I will carry you home, Miss.
thus began their fated encounter.
Young-shin is a young country girl who has just moved to the city.
she stays with Jang-hoon to treat his illness.
I have brought some mushroom extract I heard is good for lung disease.
you must've gone to so much trouble.
I just hope you get well soon.
she tries to hand the cup of medicine to Jang-hoon, but loses her hold and it breaks.
be careful. Leave this to me.
no, no, Mr. Jang.
a flame of love sparks as the two stare into each other's eyes.
suddenly, the lovers reach for each other's hands.
Jang-hun gently presses his hands against Young-shin's blushing cheeks.
it's all right. It's all right.
Jang-hoon, my love!
where are you?
your Arisu is here.
I have returned to you.
I have graduated from Tokyo University in only six months.
which means I'm the most beautiful and intelligent modern girl.
it is I! Arisu is back!
dear listeners.
we'll break for commercials.
I told you I didn't want to.
chocolate...
Morinaga Chocolate!
if you're with your love, Morinaga Chocolate.
if you need a break from stress, Morinaga Chocolate.
chocolate. Chocolate.
is it the chocolate Arisu the modern girl brought home?
Yes, it's that chocolate!
with Morinaga Chocolate even solitude can be sweet！
wow, must be real yummy, huh?
how dare you change the script like that?
ever heard of ad-libbing?
seems like you don't know much about broadcasting.
crazy bitch.
how can somebody come back so quickly from her studies?
she must've gotten expelled after screwing some guy in the dorm.
my! What vulgarity!
obviously you have no trouble understanding my vulgar language?
Oh, princess, I can see right through your crap.
one has to understand the character!
isn't Arisu an intelligent modern girl?
six months is more than enough for her to get a B. A.
but of course, character analysis is too much to ask of a cheap entertainer like yourself.
what did you just say?
Mr. Noh, please do explain.
Lloyd says I'm the heroine, but how can I be sent to Japan as soon as the story starts?
Where's the story going?
miss Marie, you see...
I cannot tell you, Miss Marie.
and why is that?
which two will kindle the flame of love in the end?
don't you know?
wait, does that mean there is no sound of a spark?
I practiced a lot.
we will have that spark. - Please, everyone!
well, things happened the way they happened.
so now we have Arisu back home from Japan.
and the important thing is how the story will go from here.
please explain Mr. Noh.
well, you see...
that is the writer's domain, and I cannot disclose it.
at least tell us what will happen in tomorrow's episode.
no, anyhow the premature return has created a major problem.
what sort of a problem?
we have to let Young-shin and Jang-hoon develop their feelings.
that's right. I have to appear more often.
tuberculosis is not cured in a day or two, you know.
now we've got a doctor here.
you think you're the heroine?
no, you are, but I have more lines.
so people will naturally think I'm the lead.
unbelievable.
Mr. Noh, please tell me.
could there be a leading role with fewer lines?
I want to know what role I will be playing.
from beginning to the end!
stop pressuring Mr. Noh, Marie.
it is you who have ruined today's episode.
why is it just because of me?
I'm a pro!
can't it happen if I'm so immersed in my role?
you need lines to 'immerse' yourself into the character.
can we have the sound of the spark earlier in the drama?
