I am. - Don't you dare.
don't you know why she hates us?
she's afraid I'll beat Amber for Miss Teenage Hairspray.
Really?
they can't put Tracy in special ed.
I won't have it.
I mean, even if I have to tutor her myself...
they cannot hold my friend back.
you're a saint. - Mm.
Oh, and it's totally not true about her and the entire football team.
I mean, please.
anybody can get grass stains all over their back.
amber, stop it.
I'm sick-a you doin' that.
just because she's a good dancer.
uh! I'm sorry.
you think that she can dance?
well, maybe you'd rather have her as your partner.
you could get sponsored by Goodyear.
excuse me. What is going on back there?
Tracy, that's horrible.
Mr. Flak does not have breasts.
what? No. I would... I would never.
what... Oh.
Oh, and Mr. Larkin, perhaps you'd like to share...
with the rest of the class Patrick Henry's immortal last words.
kiss my ass"?
you didn't have to do that, Link.
Hey, no prob.
besides, looks like a cool scene down here.
right.
Hey, cool.
Hey, Tracy!
not quite, huh?
Ah, damn. Just when I was gettin' it.
listen, man, you ain't gotta stop now.
my mom's havin' a platter party tonight.
y'all wanna come check it out?
now?!
would you mind if I, too, checked it out?
I've never been to North Avenue before.
uh, well, would it be safe?
you know, for us?
calm down, cracker boy.
it's cool.
Wow.
being invited places by colored people!
it feels so hip!
I'm glad y'all feel that way 'cause, uh, not many people do.
y'all know what I'm sayin'? - Yeah, that's right.
Hey!
I can't see why people look at me. And only see the color of my face. Ah, yeah, then there's those that try to help, God knows. But always have to put me in my place. But I won't ask you to be color-blind. 'Cause if you pick the fruit then, girl, you're sure to find. The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice. I could say it ain't so but, darlin', what's the use?
the darker the chocolate, the richer the taste. And that's where it's at. Now, baby, run and tell that. Now run and tell that. Run and tell that. Run and tell that. I can't see why people disagree. Each time I tell 'em what I know is true, oh, no. And if you come. And see the world I'm from. I bet your heart is gonna feel it, too, yeah. I could lie but, baby, let's be bold. Vanilla can be nice. But if the truth be told. Blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice. I could say it ain't so but, darlin', what's the use?
the darker the chocolate, the richer the taste. And that's where it's at Oh, baby, baby, run and tell that. Run and tell that. Go run and tell that. Run and tell that. Come on and run and tell that. Run and tell that. Hey, run and tell. Go tell Run and tell that
link!
link Larkin!
come here, girl.
this is my sister, Little Inez.
Oh, I know Tracy Turnblad.
good for you, girl. You got on the show.
well, you better be next. - Ya got that right.
Oh, you know she is. You better show 'em, girl.
I'm tired of coverin' up all my pride. So give me five on the black hand side. I got a new way of movin' and I got my own voice. So how can I help but to shout and rejoice. Oh, the people 'round here can barely pay their rent. They try to make a dollar outta fifteen cent. But we got a spirit money just can't buy. It's deep as a river and soars to the sky, to the sky!
Hey, I can't see the reason it can't be. The kinda world where we all get our chance. The time is now. So we can show 'em how just turn the music up. And let's all dance, yeah, yeah 'Cause all things are equal when it comes to love. Well, that ain't quite true 'cause when push comes to shove. The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice. They say it ain't so but, darlin', what's the use?
the darker the chocolate, the richer the taste. And that's where it's at. Now, baby, baby, baby, run and tell that. Run and tell that. Run and tell that. Ah yeah, baby. Run and tell that. Go run and tell that. G-g-g-g-go home and run and tell that - Go, baby! - Whoo!
it was horrible.
mom, he just danced on that bus...
with that great white whale and those negroes.
no, honey.
reeling him back in is the easiest thing in the world.
remember, I control his career.
now, don't worry.
mommy will take care of everything.
are you all hungry for some good fun?
bring on that pecan pie. Pour some sugar on it, sugar, don't be shy. Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl. Don't be stingy, I'm a growin' girl. I offer big love with no apology. How can I deny the world the most of me?
I am not afraid to throw my weight around. Pound by pound by pound. Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful. Face the fact, it's simply irrefutable. No one wants a meal that only offers the least. When, girl, we're servin' up the whole damn feast
well, looks like y'all took a step outta bounds.
now, who we got here?
mom, I want you to meet my new friends.
this here is Link. Tracy Turnblad.
this is just so afro-tastic!
and this young lady right here...
is Penny Pingleton.
I'm very pleased and scared to be here.
Oh, now, honey. We got more reason to be scared on your street.
Latoya, put that record down.
you gonna scratch it.
can't you keep your little girl...
shall we dance?
come on.
my name is Mike.
Mike?
Yes, Mike.
Mike who?
it's Mike.
anyway, ahem...
I'm calling because I have some information...
about your daughter's whereabouts.
what? - Right now, as we speak...
your daughter has entered a hotbed of moral...
turpentine.
baby don't sleep. Baby don't eat. Baby just like another boink-boink
link, aren't you gonna get in awful trouble for this?
I'm not plannin' on tellin' my dad.
no, I mean in trouble with someone else.
hmm. Maybe.
maybe it's worth it.
I think knowin' you's the start of a pretty big adventure.
Tracy Edna Turnblad!
Ooh, we get any more white people in here...
this gonna be a suburb.
do you know what I had to pay a cab...
just to consider comin' down here?
Oh, uh, Mom...
no call. You just disappear.
and all mashed up against a crooner?
um, Edna Turnblad, this is Link.
come on, we're goin'.
and, Penny, go home before your mother shoots you.
miss Edna, is it?
Hi, I mean, you don't have to rush off, you know.
well, I do. I left my iron on.
Oh, your iron.
well, before you go...
you sure you wouldn't like to have...
a little somethin' to eat?
is that braised?
slice me off a piece of that hogshead cheese. And take a look inside. My book of recipes. Now, don't-cha sniff around for somethin' fluffy and light. We need a man who brings a man-size appetite. We'll use a pinch-a sugar and a dash-a spice. I'll let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice. We keep it in the oven till it's good and hot. Keep on stirrin' till it hits the spot. Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful. There is nothin' 'bout us that's unsuitable. Why sit in the bleachers timid and afraid. When, Edna, you look like the whole parade?
they say that white has might and thin is in. Well, that's just bull 'Cause, ladies, big is back. And as for black, it's beautiful. All shapes and sizes follow me. Who wants a twig when you can climb a whole tree. Woke up today. Feeling the way. I always do Hungry for something that I can't eat. Then I hear that beat. That rhythm of town starts calling me down. It's like a message from high above. Pulling me out to the smiles and the streets that I love - Good morning, Baltimore! - Good morning, Baltimore. Every day's like an open door. Every night is a fantasy. Every sound's like a symphony. Good morning, Baltimore. And someday when I take to the floor. The world's gonna wake up and see. Baltimore and me. Look at my hair. What 'do can compare with mine today?
it loves candy and TV.
code NAME: HELLBOY
Douglas Army Base, N. M. Christmas Eve, 1955
my son, will you turn off that wretched puppet?
brush your teeth.
don't call him a puppet.
I beg your pardon.
look, he's not a puppet.
howdy Doody is real.
well... He's real.
Mr. Deedee Doodoo will have to say good night.
Oh, no.
and remember, you have to be asleep when he comes down the chimney.
it's not even a chimney, Pop.
he has his ways.
then I want to wait up. Watch him do it.
nonsense.
okay. I want a story then.
Oh, no, no, no. No stories tonight.
just one. And then I'll go to bed.
right away.
then I'll brush my teeth, I promise.
it is said that at the dawn of time, "man, beast and all magical beings lived together under Aiglin the Father Tree."
but man had been created with a hole in his heart, "a hole that no possession, power or knowledge could fill."
and in his infinite greed, "man dreamt of expanding his dominion over the entire Earth."
the blood of many an elf, ogre and goblin was spilled in their war with man.
and King Balor, the one-armed king of Elfland, "watched the slaughter in dread and despair."
but one day, the master of the goblin blacksmiths offered to build the king a golden mechanical army, "seventy times 70 soldiers" that would never know hunger and could not be stopped.
prince Nuada begged his father to agree.
"build me this army," the king said.
so a magical crown was forged "that would allow those of royal blood" to command the Golden Army if unchallenged.
"I am King Balor, leader of the Golden Army."
"is there anyone who disputes my right? "
and in his throne room no one challenged his word.
but, wait, what if someone could challenge him?
would they have a fight?
well, most likely.
a challenge must be answered.
but do you want to hear the end of this story or not?
Yes, please.
right.
so the world was changed, and the next time the humans marched, "they felt the earth tremble beneath their feet "and saw the sky darken with monstrous shapes.
the Golden Army had no remorse, felt no loyalty or pain.
and King Balor's heart grew heavy with regret.
so he called a truce and divided the crown in three pieces, "one for the humans, and two for himself."
in exchange, man would keep to the cities and the magical beings would own the forests.
this truce would be honored by their sons and the sons of their sons until the end of time.
but Prince Nuada did not believe in the promises of man.
and it is said that he went into exile, vowing to return the day his people needed him most.
so the Golden Army lay dormant, locked inside the Earth, waiting.
and there it is to this day, awaiting the day the crown is made whole again.
silent, still and indestructible.
Wow. What does it mean "industrable"?
indestructible.
Indestruct...
it means no one can destroy them.
go to sleep, my son.
but it's just a story, right, Pops?
is it now?
Yeah, come on.
those guys, they can't be real.
well, my son, I'm sure you'll find out.
how long have you been there, my friend?
they're over there.
I bought them today.
I haven't fed them at all.
I will go up first. You will follow.
and remember, Mr. Wink, don't be shy.

next lot. Number 776.
this is an important votive figure, a fertility goddess dating approximately 15, 000 to 10, 000 B. C.
this was found in a loess deposit in a terrace about 30 meters from the Shannon River.
and we'll open the bidding at $300, 000.
three hundred thousand.
three hundred and twenty-five, thank you.
three hundred and fifty, thank you.
three seventy-five.
three hundred and seventy-five.
going once. Going twice. Sold.
and now we move on to our next item, lot 777.
a piece of the Royal Crown of Bethmoora.
the origin of this piece harkens back to the saga of the Sons of the Earth and the creation of the fabled Golden Army.
and here it is, our next item.
ladies and gentlemen, please keep your seats.
the auction will restart shortly.
I'm sure this is just a temporary loss of power.
now, for the first time at auction, a piece of the Royal Crown of Bethmoora, coming to us from a long lost culture.
lost?
not at all.
forgotten by you, perhaps, but very, very much alive.
who are you, sir?
sir, please identify yourself. You can't just...
I am Prince Nuada Silverlance, son of King Balor.
and I am here, sir, to reclaim what is rightfully mine.
security. Call security!
what do you think you're doing?
this is outrageous.
take what you want. Please leave.
anything, take anything.
be quiet.
sit down!
proud, empty, hollow things that you are.
let this remind you why you once feared the dark.

bureau for paranormal research and defense
Fishstick. We have to talk.
undercover.
can't he get the meaning of the word?
look, we are still government-funded.
we are still a secret, although a dirty secret, if you ask me.
officially we do not exist, you see.
so that's the problem when we get these.
subway. Highway. Park.
and he posed for this one and gave an autograph.
I suppress each photo, cell phone videos.
they cost me a fortune and they show up on YouTube.
God, I hate YouTube.
well, he just wants the world outside to know what we do, what he does.
he loathes me.
I don't think so.
no?
target practice.
Oh, dear.
and then he posts them around.
do you know how that makes me feel?
what's going on?
Oh, it's Friday.
I tell you, Fishstick, he hates me.
he's out to destroy me.
my street cred is low.
street cred?
my mojo.
washington, they're wondering if I've got the stuff.
you think I have an easy job?
do you think I enjoy being a pain in the neck?
I am medicated.
I mean, this is not candy.
this is... It's an antacid.
Yes, it's an over-the-counter medicine, but this is medicine.
you see, I worry because, you know, I mean, I am, we are, after all, we're just humble public servants.
it's not about you. He's acting out.
things are a little tense with Liz.
tense? How tense? Tense how?
well, you know, the usual.
a new couple making adjustments.
they argue. -- They argue, huh?
sometimes. -- How bad?
like everybody else.
they have good days and bad days.
Hey, Abe.
Manning.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
watch it, boys, she's on fire.
then again, there are the really bad days.
I'm not afraid of you, you know.
you should be. Look at this mess. Look around.
I have one rule. Don't touch my stuff.
Oh, I get it. That's your rule. Okay.
the one and only. I'm easy.
how's that even possible?
everything is your stuff.
the same CD, LP.
it's Al Green.
you can't listen to Al Green on CD.
but it's good to keep.
and an eight-track. An eight-track, Red?
Yeah, well, one day, the world's gonna realize its mistake.
eight-track was the way to go, baby.
come on, kids, you can come out now.
that's right, it's all over. That's right.
and what about me, Red?
I need some space.
at least enough to find my toothbrush.
toothbrush? Wait a minute.
it's right there.
red! I can't live like this.
Oh, damn.
gotta go. We all gotta go.
it's an emergency, right?
let's go.
red. Red!
hold on a sec.
Oh, jeez, it's Manning. Watch yourself, Liz.
red. Red!
listen.
Manning. -- Hi.
we're going to downtown Manhattan.
Yeah, it'll be fun.
downtown. Very dangerous.
dangerous for you.
and for me.
now, I know you dream of the outside world, but, trust me, it's not that great.
it's savage, as a matter of fact. Bad.
come on, fellas, let's get this out of here.
these, on the other hand, are good.
Cuban.
good.
being seen? -- Bad.
exactly. I confiscated a box of these, and I'll get you some more.
but you've gotta do me a little favor tonight, out there.
you have to be... You have to be very, very discreet.
what? Thank you. -- You're welcome.
discreet.
invisible. In and out.
Really?
Hey, I can be discreet if I wanna be.
I followed you and Myers, didn't I?
and then you had him transferred to Antarctica.
that's very discreet.
he said he liked the cold.
like a shadow.
like a shadow in the night.
Manhattan 23: 37hrs
us Customs discovered a few illegally imported items.
it's a minor infraction. And a gas pocket.
they detected a gas pocket up there.
now FBI agents, under my command, are going up there right now with special gas equipment.
jeez, it stinks in here.
this is worse than my room.
say "cheese."
let's go.
whatever they called us for is over.
we had over 70 guests reported.
we have no survivors, no bodies.
same story here, babe.
don't call me "babe."
abe, I said. "Abe." Wrong channel.
abe, I think Liz is still mad at me.
still the same channel.
can I ask you a question?
no.
now, listen. When we get home later, I'm gonna clean up my whole mess.
that's not the problem.
what is it?
not now.
abe, what have you got?
Oh, this is interesting.
both boxes have the Royal Seal.
only delivered at a time of war.
red? We have company.
come on, Blue, give me something to work with here.
burrowing creatures.
how many of them? -- Many.
there are no corpses because there are no leftovers.
have you noticed the floor?
Oh, crap.
precisely.
all these things do is eat and eat.
then poop, and then eat again.
remind you of anyone?
damn it, Abe. What are these things?
english, English.
Oh, they're Tooth Fairies.
no, no. Third century, Black Forest.
feed mostly on calcium, bones, skin, organs.
but they do go for the teeth first.
hence the name Tooth Fairies.
I bet you they don't leave money, either.
Oh, my God.
Liz, you're pregnant.
no, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
what have you got, Marble?
think I may have found one.
but he's kind of cute.
don't go near it!
it's biting me!
marble.
it hurts! It hurts!
red, we need you here!
marble.
nasty little...
keep firing, Abe. Keep firing!
damn.
sorry, lady.
you should be running.
there's a safe upstairs.
how do we get there?
we need a clearing.
run!
up to the safe, now!
Abe. Up the stairs.
come on, Liz, burn them all. Go. Go!
Yes, we're going!
get in the safe, Abe. Get in the safe!
Oh, no, no.
no, no, no!
steel!
damned beasts.
fire is mine.
fire is in me.
red, stay away from the window!
fire is me.
stop biting me!
fire is me.
world, here I come.
what have you done?
guess we're out.
Hey, Hellboy, over here.
east Side Railyards, midnight
your Royal Highness.
prince Nuada, you honor us with your return.
before entering the council chamber, you must surrender your weapon.
I will not.
it is protocol, sire, for peasant and prince alike.
it will be my pleasure to finish you off, Chamberlain
please, brother... surrender it.
for you, Sister, anything.
according to multiple eye witnesses, lives were, in fact, endangered.
there you have it, Hellboy.
but is he really on our side?
do you have superpowers?
well, yeah.
but, really, all I wanna be is just an ordinary person, just like you and everybody.
Hey, guys. You're missing this.
we're on TV.
Liz. Liz, are you all right?
Yeah, I'll be out in a minute.
you don't need to do that. You can trust me.
my readings are quite accurate.
shut up, Abe.
get your damn hand away from the door.
you have nothing to fear.
in spite of appearances, I believe Red would be an excellent father figure.
and what about this guy?
walking around with a toilet seat on his head.
a toilet seat!
it's quite obvious it's a breathing apparatus.
Hey, I think we gotta lose the garbage truck.
sends out the wrong signal.
you think that's our problem?
transportation?
and this girl, we definitely have to find out what's wrong with her.
she's cute, though. We should get her on the show.
I hate it when people stare at me.
makes me feel like a freak.
you had no right, Red.
it's Manning. Could you...
how many times do I have to tell you?
it's a gas pocket.
and a gaseous phenomenon that occurred...
gas pocket. What an idiot.
you've murdered me.
you have murdered me.
you have ridiculed me.
and you have brought this unto yourself.
what?
washington is sending down a new BPRD agent.
a new guy?
Why?
to look after you.
sire, please.
father
Why?
why have you done this?
Why?
to set us free. All of us, Father.
you have broken an ancient truce between our people and mankind.
a truce based on shame.
the humans have forgotten the gods, destroyed the Earth. And for what?
parking lots. Shopping malls.
greed has burned a hole in their heart that will never be filled.
they will never have enough.
what humans do is in their nature...
... to honor the truce is in ours.
honor?
look at this place. Where is the honor in it?
father, you were once a proud warrior.
when did you become their pet?
I have returned from exile to wage war and reclaim our land, our birthright.
and for that, I will call upon the help of all of my people.
and they will answer, the good, the bad and the worst.
the Golden Army!
you cannot be that mad.
perhaps I am. Perhaps they made me so.
awaken the army, but our green fields cannot grow out of all that blood.
let the army sleep.
if our days have ended, let us all fade.
we will not fade.
for the last time, my son, I ask you is this the path you wish to take?
it is.
I am sorry, Father.
then you leave me no choice.
death
and you, Sister, are you at peace with your king's verdict?
I am, my brother. I am.
then very well. Death it is.
I always loved you, Father.
now, for the final piece, my sister.
where is she, Wink? Where is she?
go find her. Now! Find her!
B.P.R.D
pardon me, boys. Excuse me. Excuse me.
is he here? -- Not yet.
I'm telling you, we don't need this guy.
well, I think we do.
evidently, this guy's quite the big shot in Washington.
what's his name?
his name is Johann Krauss.
johann Krauss? Sounds German.
he's the top man in Ectoplasmic.
Yes, thank you. Ectoplasmic research.
comes highly recommended by our European liaison.
johann Krauss. -- Liaison.
I love that word, don't you?
it's so hoity toity.
I don't like Germans. -- No fingerprints.
here he comes. -- Germans make me nervous.
no photo. Dossier says, and I translate, "He has a nice open face."
Oh, my God.
Damen und Herren, Johann Krauss at your service.
I like him.
look at that. Poor little thing.
bought and sold on the black market.
crammed into cargo containers.
smuggled, abused.
he has very expressive hands.
the seal on the box worries me also.
a warring emblem.
Yes, from the Bethmoora clan.
the Sons of the Earth.
your file says you're the brains of the operation, and I must admit, I'm impressed.
in my file, you'll see, Mr. Krauss, that I worked very closely with Abe in his training.
ja, okay.
let's see what our little friend here can remember.
memory gets a little sketchy right after you've burned to death.
but maybe Saint Malachy can help.
Oh, no, no. No amulets, Mein Herr.
Teleplasty.
plastic. Very modern.
Teleplasty by which an ectoplasmic medium, such as Dr. Krauss, can control inanimate things, organic, mechanical, dead or alive.
take it, take it all in, mein Junge.
there we are. Get up.
get up. Get up.
now I have full control of its limbic system.
let us see how long I can hold it.
what?
Hey, you chewed off the tip of my tail.
Yeah, you, you little...
it says you're rude, brutish and not very bright.
it seems our little friend here remembers market sounds and voices.
and a peculiar troll language spoken in the last place his cage was opened.
the troll market.
the troll market? Come on.
no one's ever found it.
that's because it doesn't exist.
Mr. Krauss? Dr. Krauss, sir.
our little informant there doesn't look so good.
back inside, you. There we are.
so, now we know where to begin.
trolls dwell under bridges.
Wow. You're a genius.
by the way, there's over 2, 000 bridges in New York City.
but Vladimir Vanya, 19th century occult historian, places the troll market directly under the east end of the Brooklyn Bridge.
we've already looked there.
Yes, you have, but not with me, Agent.
not with me.
we're moving in.
Brooklyn Bridge 03: 30hrs
keep it coming, keep it coming. Hold it.
not with me, Agent. What an ego.
I like him.
well, you can keep him.
I mean, am I the only one that thinks this guy is full of...
no, no, no, no, don't lean.
lot 336, the Schufftein glasses. Could it be?
the three surviving pairs, and we will use them to locate the troll market.
Dr. Krauss, what a coup.
the Schufftein glasses.
you're my hero.
Hey. You Hellboy?
Yeah.
you're ugly, man.
two more on the wall in front of me and then three on the alleys facing that way.
what do you think of Mr. Know-lt-All?
don't know, too early to tell.
Hey, you're Hellboy.
I know, I'm ugly.
forget it.
we'll talk about it later.
he's sure of himself, and I think maybe you're intimidated.
intimidated. Huh?
keep us up to date on the cameras, Agent Sherman. Over and out.
what's this?
normally, we can't see fairy folk and trolls.
they generate a cloaking aura called "glamour."
but in 1878, Emil Schufftein designed and built these.
four crystal diopters that penetrate that effect and reveal the true nature of things.
Oh, Dr. Krauss, they're more beautiful than I'd imagined.
you must try them on then. Oh, yes.
try them on, Agent. -- They'll look good.
I love these tight little leather straps.
intimidated?
Mr. Kraut? Sir?
Krauss, Agent. With a double S.
S-S. Right, right.
listen, those gizmos?
how do you know they work?
I have a suspect.
give me a vector, Agent Sherman. A vector.
B--12, the alley, northbound.
well, track the target. We're coming down.
keep an eye on her. I'll be right back.
this little old lady? Come on.
it's a Fragglewump, an ugly Scottish troll.
they're afraid of canaries.
Oh, my God. Canaries, huh?
what about the kittens?
she feeds on them.
come on, then. Kitty, kitty, kitty.
that thing is a "she"?
under the Brooklyn Bridge 04: 57hrs
down, you fools.
what do you think you are doing?
she's gonna eat the cat.
you'll make her aware of our presence.
we should use the canary now.
she's gonna eat it!
we should use the bird, Dr. Krauss.
the bird.
she's going to eat the cat.
you will stay put and follow my orders.
I can't sit by here...
you are directly under my command, and you have to obey.
stay put! -- Oh, screw this!
Hey! Lucy.
come back here.
I'm home.
Oh, yes, dearie. Can I help you?
give it up, nasty. We can see you.
you see me?
how? How do you see me?
we're looking for the entrance to the troll market. Any clues?
come any closer and I'll rip your heart.
we're gonna have to get a little old-school, Abe.
give me the bird.
not a canary.
what, you're afraid of this little guy?
who'd know?
no more, no more.
I'll take you there.
come on, let's go, you dirty old troll.
let's go.
agent Sherman, we are going into the troll market.
keep communication to a minimum.
over und out.
I like him.
you see, this is a man who takes charge.
you think?
Yeah. He's efficient.
he's precise.
you add "resistant" to that, you got yourself a new watch.
Dr. Krauss is aware of the chain of command, and he...
Oh, brother!
he seems to like me.
here we are.
wow, that's some door!
it's a complex combination lock.
what do you think, Agent Sapien?
not good.
with the number of symbols on the combination, we'll be here for days.
well, not necessarily.
let me try my technique.
open it, Lucy.
I will not.
pretty please.
do as you may, demon.
release the yellow beast.
tear my eyes out.
rip my insides and my legs and my tongue, but I will never open that door.
is that your investigative technique?
it said "never."
it's unconscionable.
that means he didn't like it.
what?
so, what, you're gonna show us how it's done, Mr. By-The-Book?
is that it?
Yes, I think I will.
there we are.
let me see. Yes.
gentlemen, welcome to the troll market.
fresh fish
get your fresh fish...
red, there's something really important that I need to tell you.
Oh, Liz, you should be here. You'd love it.
nobody's looking at us. We blend right in.
agent, I said keep communication to a minimum.
you'll blow our cover.
you know? I think he's right.
I'm bringing you here for sure, babe.
the fishbowl wants radio silence. So...
over and out.
the Royal Seal.
brother Red. Red, do you read me?
Yeah, I read you, Blue, but I'm watching Sherlock at work.
I'll get back to you.
excuse me, sir.
sir, excuse... Pardon me. Sir, may I ask a...
excuse me, gentlemen.
have you seen anyone purchasing this type of Tooth Fairy?
no one sells them down here, pal.
over in Jersey, maybe.
well, what about this, then?
do you recognize this seal?
make him go away. Make him go away.
no. We don't.
please, dear sir.
you'd better go. Now!
we'll make it worth your while.
don't waste your time. We will not talk!
what are you doing?
you're absolutely sure about that, huh?
Absolutely.
you won't talk, eh?
never.
never, huh?
never ever, ever.
feeling a little chattier now?
we'll never talk.
Yes, yes.
we will, only don't hit me anymore.
chicken.
who bought the Tooth Fairies?
prince Nuada.
they say Prince Nuada broke the truce, and now there is talk of war, a war with the human world.
sorry, kid.
that's all right.
nice baby.
I'm not a baby. I'm a tumor.
Yes, Red. I am following a lead right now.
it may turn out...
it may turn out to be nothing, but I will let you know soon enough.
what do you want? Tell me your name.
follow me.
your father left you this map.
in it, he said, lies the secret to the location of the Golden Army.
move away! Quickly, Your Highness.
can I help you with something?
no, thank you. I'm just looking.
you can't go in there!
sir, why are you following me?
I...
I was just hoping to find an old map chart of Algiers.
why are you following me?
I was not.
did my brother send you to steal the crown piece?
your brother?
Oh, you're sorely mistaken, I assure you.
then answer me truthfully.
why were you following me?
my name is Abraham Sapien.
there is no such name.
Oh, I don't like it either, but I...
enough.
give me your hand.
your hand.
you are an agent for the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense.
and your name is...
horrible, I know.
I'm Nuala, Princess Nuala.
Yes, I know.
forgive me, Your Highness, but as you were learning about me, I couldn't help but learn a bit about you myself.
I know that you need our help.
I'm afraid it's the other way around.
the window. Out now.
I will take care of this.
Oh, dear.
go! Now go!
get out of here, Blue.
Yes. Come with me, Your Highness.
you.
let me put this to you as delicately as I can.
my cigar, it was Cuban.
now you pissed me off.
Oh, crap.
now stay down!
damn.
a tooth. Happy?
give it up, pal. It's over.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Wow. Told you.
Oh, mein Gott, what have you done, Agent Hellboy?
look at this! Now we have to leave.
red. This is Princess Nuala.
lady.
we should leave. Now. Now!
let's go.
wink is dead...
a big red man killed him.
is there something you need to tell me?
up there
no, up there!
up at the market
wink is dead.
to wage his war, my brother needs this, the final piece of the Crown of Bethmoora and this map to the location of the Golden Army chamber.
the Golden Army.
the harbingers of death.
the unstoppable tide.
howdy Doody.
your Highness, if you hand the crown piece over to us...
no. Where it goes, I go.
my father died to uphold the truce with your world.
you must honor his noble intention.
the lady's in dire danger.
I take it you're vouching for her, Agent Sapien?
most emphatically. Yes, I am.
even so.
I am sorry, but we simply cannot assume such responsibility on our own.
the lady just lost her father.
what more do you want?
you may not care, but there are procedures, rules and little handbooks...
she's coming with us.
you got that, Gas Bag?
what did you call me?
you.
you will pay for what happened to my friend down there.
Yeah, right. You take checks?
demon.
born from a womb of shadows.
sent to destroy their world, and you still believe you belong.
are we gonna talk all night?
cause I'm really sleepy.
no, Brother, no!
kill him.
it's just a jumping bean.
it's going for water. Hurry.
Oh, dear.
no. No, no, no, no. No.
what the hell is that? - Excuse me!
stay back - Hey, what's going on?
we've got target in sight.
it's an Elemental, a giver of life and a destroyer.
what?
a Forest God.
a Forest God, eh?
I'm gonna get me Big Baby.
somebody help! My baby's...Help! Help!
how can I help you, ma'am?
my baby's inside!
come with us, dear lady, please.
there's nothing to worry about.
we've got everything under control.
please. My baby's still in there! Please!
Hey, little guy.
homing in on target.
hang on, kid.
agent Hellboy.
reach higher ground and shoot the weapon.
shoot the weapon!
first praise the tail, kid.
you must shoot it in the energy ganglion.
the what?
the energy ganglion.
Scheisse. The head! Shoot it in the head!
Oh, crap.
you gotta trust me, little buddy. Okay?
you woke up the baby.
agent Hellboy, take the shot!
right now! Take it!
that's an order! Take the shot.
that's an order, Agent Hellboy.
shoot it! Shoot the gun! Shoot the gun!
demon.
what are you waiting for?
this is what you wanted, isn't it?
look at it. It's the last of its kind.
like you and I. You destroy it, the world will never see its like again.
shoot it!
you have more in common with us than with them.
it's breaking free.
you could be a king.
you will not disobey a direct order!
shoot it! It's getting loose!
if you cannot command...
it will destroy everything!
that's an order, Agent Hellboy!
...then you must obey.
shoot it now! - Damn.
shoot it!
move back. Step back, step back.
it's beautiful.
and this huge monster just came out of nowhere!
yo, give the baby back, man!
Oh, what have you done to my baby?
the baby's fine.
you freak!
Hellboy, what'd you do to that baby?
the baby's fine.
don't move. Hands in the air! Up!
he's got a weapon in his hand.
that is his hand.
miss, stay away from him for your own safety.
he was trying to help. Don't you see?
he was just trying to help.
that's all we do.
that's all we've done all these years.
she's touching his hand!
we've just tried to help you. You.
you're a goddamn freak.
we don't need you around!
what a freak.
Liz.
let's go home.
...investigation of the BPRD and its promotion of intra-species marriage seen by many as a threat to traditional families, fuelled by federal funds.
I didn't touch you yet.
you did a good job out there.
then tell me, why don't I feel so good?
I mean, I killed that thing. And for what?
they don't even like me.
I mean, they're afraid of me.
what do we do with that?
red, I don't want you to freak out.
I'm gonna leave for a little bit.
I need time to think.
about what?
can't you do your thinking right here?
look, I'll be really, really quiet.
I'll get rid of the cats.
red, why are you with me?
do you need everyone to like you?
everybody? Or am I enough?
think about it.
you stay. We belong dead.

tennyson, "In Memoriam." A beautiful poem.
forgive me, I didn't mean to startle you.
Oh, no. No, no. I borrowed this book.
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no, no. Please, this is your home now.
you are safe here.
my brother will find me. He always does.
how could he?
our location is a highly classified secret.
Yes, but I know of it now, which means that he does, too.
we're twins.
even as children, a link has bound us one to the other.
something I cannot explain.
no need.
you look different.
Oh, do I?
perhaps my hair?
no.
it's your eyes. I can see your eyes.
Yes. Just trying a new look.
is that a map?
Yes, it was in the cylinder.
there are no coordinates.
perhaps there's a watermark.
you were very brave vouching for me.
how do you know I'm not the enemy, bringing me here?
it's as you were saying just now.
from intuition maybe, a link.
normally I'm able to read others quite quickly, but I've never met anyone like you.
nor I, like you.
good night, Abraham.
good night, Princess. Your Highness.

gute Nacht, Agent Hellboy.
look, Agent, I know you don't like me, but I could take away your badge.
never had one.
kept asking, though.
you will learn to obey me, follow protocol and stay fockused at all times.
Oh, that word "fockused.
Yeah, with your accent, I wouldn't use it that much.
I knew Professor Broom, young man.
you didn't know Professor Broom.
Yes, I did.
after my accident... - Shut up. Shut up.
...he designed this containment suit.
a wonderful man.
and even then he was worried about your future. He...
Hey, Gas Bag, stop it!
right now.
or what? Are you threatening me?
because I think I can take you.
excuse me?
you heard me.
I couldn't hear you from all the way over there.
I can take you because you have one fatal flaw.
Oh, I wanna hear it.
no, you don't. You can't take criticism.
try me.
can't take it.
what's my flaw?
your temper. It gets the best of you.
makes you weak. Makes you vulnerable.
Oh, crap.
Johann.
Johann? Johann?
Hey, Johann?
come on, pal. Hang in there, will you?
Johann? Johann?
damn.
there we are.
your temper, it makes you sloppy.
try to control it, Agent Hellboy.
before it controls you.

Hello, Red.
well, you're up late.
what are you listening to?
Vivaldi. Il cimento dell'armonia.
I particularly like the last...
Hey, hey. What's that?
just a remote.
this? Yes.
popular Love Songs.
Oh, Abe.
you fell for the Princess.
she's... She's like me.
a creature from another world.
you need to get out more.
she's alone in the world. I wanna help her.
I need to care for her.
you're in love. Have a beer.
Oh, my body's a temple.

no, no, no.

I know.
Yep, I'm gonna need a beer, too.
well, see, I love this song.
and I can't smile or cry.
I think I have no tear ducts.
I wish Father were here.
he'd know what to tell you. Us.
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything
you see, I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
if you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you
you came along
just like a song
and brightened my day
who'd have believed that you were part of a dream?

and now you know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you

it's the last one.
look at her. She's it, Abe.
she's it.
she's my whole wide...
you know?
Yeah. Yeah.
I would give my life for her.
but she also wants me to do the dishes.
I would die and do the dishes.
why is she mad at me?
it's not because the room is dirty.
something else.
well, ask her, then.
no.
listen, Abe.
Yeah.
when a woman's mad about something, but she's really mad about something else, you can't ask because then they get angry because you had to ask.
do you know what I mean?
never mind, don't answer that question.
you gotta just...
Yeah.
...find out.
very quick of you. The parchment.
it was of no importance.
the cylinder is very interesting.
we will find the Golden Army here.
as for the crown piece, I know it's here.
I can feel that much from you.

but it's in one of the books, and I will find it.

listen, listen, Red.
I know what's going on with Liz.
red.
Abe.
I'm sorry. He has to know.
Abe!
know what?
Why?
stay back. I'll go first.
Abraham. No, don't... He'll kill you.
princess?
Abraham?
you talk to him like that?
No!
I will kill you, Abraham.
and anyone else if that is necessary.
well?
then why don't you just start with me, Your Royal Assness?
who put those there?
and your weapon of choice?
five-fingered Mary.
you move and I'll kill your Abraham first.
red, you mustn't harm the Prince.
what?
if you hurt him, you hurt the Princess.
you've gotta be kidding me.
will you give me the crown piece?
no.
the piece. No.
Abe?
red, I'm so sorry, but they're linked.
what's going on?
red. - Liz.
red, behind you.
you may have mused in the past, "Am I mortal?
you are now.
abraham, many people have died for this crown.
he will, too.
if you want to save him and see her again, you will find the missing piece and bring it to me.
Jesus, Abe, pull the damn thing out!
I cannot.
every time I touch it, every time I come close to it, it moves closer to his heart.
I don't know what else to do.
the wound will not heal until the spear is removed.
we're running out of time.
then we go after the Prince.
and we make him take it out.
Hey, Liz.
you were asking me.
don't talk.
no, no, let me tell you.
I know what's important.
it's you.
red.
I could turn my back on the world, all of it, as long as you stay with me.
I'll stay with you.
you're the best man I've ever met.

the cylinder yielded coordinates to County Antrim, Northern Ireland.
the Giant's Causeway. Right about here.
great. So we know where he is.
what are we waiting for?
we should get going.
the Prince will demand the crown piece, Agent Sherman.
so we give it to him.
Dr. Manning?
I'm afraid it's not as simple as that.
hold on here, what are you saying?
the Golden Army must not awaken.
so, what?
you're just gonna let him die, is that it?
I'm sorry.
we called Washington. We have our orders.
and what about you? He saved your life.
I know.
I know this is difficult for you, but...
well, I won't let him die.
agent Sherman, may I remind you that I am the leader of this team.
Oh, there's no doubt about that, sir.
that is what you are, Dr. Krauss.
and if ever you were human, that time is long gone.
what's wrong with her?
you want me to call her back, sir?
let her go.
I understand.
what about you?
you find anything?
no. Nothing yet.
well, keep looking.
absolutely, sir.
all of you.
but don't worry, sir, we know it's here, and we're gonna find it.
when Tom Manning gets on the case, things get done.
they get done. They get done!
100%. I guarantee that.
even without the piece, we have to get him out of here.
we'll go to Antrim, and we will find the Prince.
keep looking.
I ask you, everybody, keep looking.
Abe.
just the two of us.
Yes. Yes.
let's go.
we need to leave now, before they run our clearance upstairs.
Guten Abend, meine Freunde.
do you have authorization to take that plane?
you're not gonna stop us, Johann.
on the contrary, I've been giving it some thought, and we should be able to save Agent Hellboy.
you say I'm not human anymore, but you are wrong.
I understand your pain all too well.
a long time ago, I lost the woman I loved.
and that was, in fact, the source of my present misfortune.
I will tell you about it one day.
but for now, the tactical advantage is ours.
consider this, the Prince lacks the crown piece and without it, his army poses no threat.
so we have clearance, then?
agent Sherman, Liz, screw the clearance.
we will take that plane!
Antrim, Northern Ireland, 09: 00hrs
it should be here someplace.
the entrance should be here.
I don't understand.
perhaps there's a mistake on the map.
hello there!
I bid you welcome, strangers.
how can I be of assistance?
we seek safe passage to Bethmoora.
and what does a nice little girl like you want in the nightlands?
we are looking for Prince Nuada.
him, I know.
trade me something, and I'll take you to him.
here. I have a shiny belt.
but I have no pants.
look, a wonderful set of magic eyes.
I already have binoculars.
but I see something special, something shiny underneath the bandages.
I want that.
no, you can't take it out.
not without killing him.
maybe I know someone who can.
will you trade me then?
all right.
very well.
keep going. Keep going.
Oh, my God.
you should have seen this city when it was alive.
what happened to it?
curse.
as soon as the Golden Army was stored here, a plague of silence and death befell us.
and the world left us behind.
for a long time, I alone dwelled in the dust.
all right, little girl, the two of you come inside.
the rest of you, wait out here.
Hello, old friend.
I have brought you visitors.
and I have a favor to ask you.
I owe no favor to you, goblin. Leave.
but I have done so much for you.
I have brought you many souvenirs.
and he has something shiny.
red.
something mine.
red!
Anung un Rama.
you know that name?
and yours. Elizabeth Sherman.
at last.
I have been waiting for you both many a winter moon.
I am his death, and I will meet him at each crossroads.
good. But when can I have that which is mine?
can you save him?
it is for you to decide that.
it is all the same to me.
my heart is filled with dust and sand, but you should know it is his destiny to bring about the destruction of the Earth.
not now, not tomorrow, but soon enough.
knowing that, you still want him to live?
so, child, make the choice.
the world or him?
him.
the time will come and you, my dear, will suffer more than anyone.
I'll deal with it.
now save him.
it is done.
I have done what I can.
now, give him a reason to live.
Hey, friend, what about that which is mine?
don't forget about me. What about me?
friend?
shiny.
listen to me, you big ape.
you have to get up.
you have to get up.
cause you're gonna be a father.
I become father?
well, all this is very touching, but if you still want to meet Nuada, we have to leave now.
ready.
here we are.
and there they are.
seventy times 70 soldiers.
sometimes I wish I'd never created them.
Bim-bam went the hammers!
whoosh went the furnaces!
and one of those fires took my legs off, now.
this is as far as I can go.
I'm not very good with steps.
but if you're here to stop him, the Prince, I wish you luck then.
the Golden Army must not awaken.
undo what we did.
we will.
you're here.
so I assume you brought the remaining piece.
no. We didn't, but we should discuss...
I'm not addressing you, Tin Man.
Abraham.
Abraham?
my sister is well as I promised, so... - Abe?
don't do it.
what the hell are you doing?
you would do the exact same for Liz.
agent Sapien, no!
I am Prince Nuada, Silverlance, leader of the Golden Army.
is there anyone here who would dispute my right?
kill them.
but...
don't do it.
he lied to us.
abe, old buddy, if we ever get out of this, we gotta talk.
open wide!
Industrable, my ass.
Hey! Throw me a bone here!
Oh, crap.
well, I'm out of ideas.
I got one.
I challenge Prince Nuada for the right to command this army.
you challenge me?
who are you to challenge me?
you are nobody.
you are not royalty.
Yes. Yes! He is Anung un Rama, son of the Fallen One.
he has the right.
a challenge must be answered.
very well then.
red, please. Red, Think about it.
guys. Guys! - He will kill you.
don't do this, Red.
don't worry, babe.
I'm not gonna kill him, Abe.
but I am gonna kick his ass.
red.
nice ride, huh?
you jumpy, slippery bastard.
I got you now.
kill me. You must, for I will not stop.
I cannot. Sorry, pal.
I win.
you live.
Nuala.
the humans, they will tire of you.
they have already turned against you.
leave them.
is it them or us?
which holocaust should be chosen?
I never had a chance to tell you how I felt.
give me your hand.
it's beautiful.
we die and the world will be poorer for it.
Nuala, my sister.
all that power.
don't even think about it.
no. No, it's nothing.
I told you, it's a dead end.
what are you doing? Go away.
check the belt locator.
check the belt locators, over there.
over there.
you, you took that plane without an authorization, young man.
Hey. Manning.
here to help as always.
what's going on? What's going on?
I quit.
what? Are you serious?
looks that way, doesn't it?
what's wrong with you? You can't all just quit.
watch us.
on second thought,
I think I'll keep this.
come on. Come on!
Johann, they can't do this. Stop them.
Dr. Manning, suck my ectoplasmic schwanzstucker.
so what you said before, about us living anywhere.
guys. Guys!
anywhere. You and me. - Come on back.
let's find a place in the country.
I said come on back.
clean air. Green hills.
a yard with lots of room to grow in.
it'll be great for the baby.
babies.
a girl will never forget the first boy she likes.
even if things don't quite work out.
why did you do that?
because you smell like dog poo.
you're so stupid, just like dog poo.
you're made out of poo!
but usually someone is there to offer words of wisdom.
made...
...of...
...dog...
...poo...
honey...
...do you know why that little boy did those things and said those things?
it's because he likes you.
and there it is.
that's the beginning of our problem.
that little boy is doing those terrible things because he's got a crush on you.
do you know what this means?
we're all encouraged...
...no, programmed...
...to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk...
...that means he likes you.
here's the problem: He likes you too much.
you're too pretty and too awesome.
Yes. He can't handle it.
that Phi Delt so obviously liked you.
I'm sure he just lost your number.
he's not asking you out because he's intimidated by your professional success.
trust me.
it's because he's just getting out of a serious relationship.
trust me. It's because he's never had a serious relationship.
why do we say this stuff to each other?
is it possible that it's because we're too scared...
...and it's too hard to say the one obvious truth...
...that's staring everyone in the face?
he's just not that into you
so Janine says you're a real-estate agent.
Yeah, but I'm not one of those cheesy ones...
...that puts my headshots on bus benches and grocery carts.
so just, like, Frisbees and notepads?
basically.
it's much classier. My thoughts exactly.
wonder why Janine never thought to introduce us before.
I don't know. I don't know.
Hey, guys. Want another round? You want one more?
only if you do. I mean, if you need to get going, I totally...
okay, well...
sure. I am alright. Ketel and soda?
and a beer, please.
be right back.
well, conor, I had a really nice time.
it was really nice meeting you.
Bye. See you.
Hey, it's me.
he's cute, and I think it went well.
and I think he might be leaving me a message at home as we speak.
Hey, it's me. Just wanted to let you know
I was thinking about you.
Oh, that's very sweet of you, conor. Thanks.
listen, I was wondering if you wanted to grab a late bite.
tonight? I...
no, I was supposed to meet friends but I'm burnt out. Don't be mad at me.
no, of course, I'm not mad. Well, I'll be up for a while.
do you wanna go ahead of me?
Oh, can you hold on? Okay.
no, that's fine. You just have one thing, so...
no, technically I have six...
...and I'm mulling over a gum purchase, so I think you should go.
okay.
let me call you right back.
all right. Okay.
Hi. Hey.
just that and that, please.
thank you.
Oh, my word.
Seriously? That's not possible.
I just deposited cash three days ago, so it's just not possible.
Oh, it's not that. Let me check something.
congratulations, you won.
what?
our Funky Fall promotion.
you're our 1000th customer this month.
what?
are you kidding me?
I don't do kidding.
Oh, my God. I can't believe this, it's so exciting.
Oh, my God. I never won anything before.
this is the most exciting thing that ever happened to me.
is that sad?
yea... No. I don't think so.
Really? Yes.
thank you! Come here.
as the Terps move to mid-ice, trying to...
Hey. Hey.
how was the date? It was fine. Whatever.
why are you here? My cable's out.
come on, Spiewak, it's not the Ice capades.
you didn't hear the phone ring by any chance, did you?
no, I didn't. Shit.
Anna gave me the old, "I'll call you right back.
Oh, shit, yeah? Well, how long ago?
that was 22 minutes ago.
do I call back?
should you call back? No, absolutely not.
I'm gonna call back and say I'm going to bed.
what? No. It's 9: 30. You're gonna...?
no, it's a great idea.
I'll call and say, "In case you were gonna call me back, don't...
...because I'll be sleeping." A genius idea.
okay, no, that's brilliant.
when you wake up you can say, "I'm awake now, I'm available to take your call.
Oh, gosh. A second.
sorry about that. It's all right.
I was...
wait, what was I saying again?
you don't wanna be like your mother, wake up one morning...
...and realize you never pursued your dreams.
is that what I was saying?
you want some gum? No, thank you.
God, that's kind of heavy for a grocery chat.
no, that's okay. Isn't it?
sorry. I actually might be able to help.
Yeah, I know a guy at my office who deals exclusively with music clients.
are you kidding?
Oh, my God.
are you my savior or something? No.
can you hold this for a second? Yeah.
Oh, this is so unexpected.
okay...
I don't...
I'm married.
I don't do this.
you don't do what? You don't help struggling singers?
not hot yoga-instructing singers...
...who are incredibly charming.
well, you could... You could give me your card.
that's legit, right? Is that allowed?
I could do that.
Yeah. That'd be okay, right?
Yeah.
great, thank you so much.
course. Do you need help to your car?
Where'd you park? No, I'm fine. It's okay.
it was very nice to meet you. Yeah.
okay.
who was that?
Oh, that was a prospective client.
okay.
I can talk to a woman. It doesn't have to be like that.
no. Absolutely not.
just drive. Relax.
how you doing? Good.
yeah? Yeah. I just got off the phone.
yeah? Yeah, with my little sister.
how's she doing? She's getting married.
Really?
Yeah.
great.
you really think that's great?
Yeah.
Devon seems like...
...a great guy.
well, so you think it's great that they're getting married...
...but you don't ever feel like we're going against nature, or something...by not getting married?
no.
going against nature is like the cat who suckled that monkey.
you and I are just two people who happen not to be married.
let me tell you something.
people who get married are not to be trusted.
you are so weird.
they're not. You know why?
because if you are so legitimately happy, honestly...
you wouldn't feel the need to make a big show out of it.
you wouldn't have to broadcast it.
they do it because they're insecure...
...and they think getting married's what they're supposed to be doing.
so they're lying to themselves and to other people.
seriously.
think about you and your friends. Okay?
these women you have great relationships with...
you're close to them, some of them you've known for years.
but you don't feel the need...
...to write a $45 check to the state of Maryland for a friendship certificate.
Yeah. No, I get that. Right?
why should it be any different, you know, with me and you?
we're very happy, I love you, I'm committed to you...
...we have a great life, you know?
Yes, you're right.
why can't we just be happy?
you're right.
I'm gonna get you some more tea. Okay.
please enter your pass...
you have no messages.
main menu. To send a message...
okay, so clearly he hasn't called.
maybe he's away on business.
he sells real estate. In Baltimore.
staying in town is his business. Right.
well, look, let me tell you.
after I went out with Ben for the first time, he didn't call me for 11 days.
eleven days. And now he's the world's best husband.
that happens all the time.
Really? Really.
you want coffee?
I got you 2 percent. Thanks.
this is all your fault.
what? Why?
you set us up.
no. You asked me if I know any guys, and I gave conor your phone number.
that's not a setup.
when I do a setup, I weigh the pros and cons.
I do my due diligence.
all I know about conor is that he sold us this house.
seriously, stop.
he said he always hangs out after work at the city Supper club.
maybe I should do a little drive-by?
please don't.
he'll call.
okay, I have a question:
why'd they even invent caller ID?
it's, like, who is this service helping?
I mean, for centuries...
okay, well maybe not centuries, but for, like, a lot and lot of years...
...people have been answering their phone, not knowing who it is...
...and as far as I can tell, no one's died from that.
and it's like if the police wanna know who placed a call, they could trace it.
I mean, what am I, the police?
this constant obsession with needing to know who's calling all the time...
...it's, like, so gross.
like, you pick up the phone, you find out who it is, then you know.
it's, like...
look, all I'm saying...
...if a guy doesn't call me,
I would like to reserve the right...
...to call him at 15-minute intervals until he picks up.
but if he looks down and sees my numbers...
...he's gonna think I'm some kind of psycho or something.
which I'm not.
obviously.
Hello?
mom.
I gotta call you back.
inhale. Upward-facing dog.
look up towards the ceiling.
he ordered more drinks for us when the waitress came.
he remembered exactly what I wanted.
he initiated the hug. He said it was nice meeting me.
so wait.
this was at the end of the date or the beginning of the date?
end. Why, does it matter?
Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning of the date, that's normal.
nice meeting you" at the end of the date...
it could be a blowoff.
maybe it was at the beginning.
okay. That's fine. He's gonna call.
or maybe it was at the end.
or maybe it was just nice to meet me.
help.
Hi. This is torture.
how am I supposed to come up with something pithy and dynamic ...to say about cinnamon blends?
it's hard to focus on nutmeg...
...when the guy who might be the guy of my dreams...
...refuses to call me.
after my first date with Neil...
...I called him.
there are no rules anymore.
and, I mean, why should you have to wait for him to get off his ass?
it's ringing. That's pretty standard.
Hey, you've reached Conor. Yes! Voicemail.
leave a message, I'll get back to you. Notes.
Hey, conor, it's Gigi.
I just thought, I hadn't heard from you...
...and how stupid is it that a gal has to wait for a guy's call anyway, right?
what does that say?
because we're all equal, right?
more than equal.
more women are accepted into law school now than men.
and, I mean, I don't know if you saw that Dateline...
...but women practically have penises now, right? So...
call me.
Oh, this is Gigi. Call me.
don't worry, he's totally gonna call.
what?
how can there not be a dial tone?
how can there not be a dial tone?
no dial tone. Come here, dial tone.
Gigi, are you there?
Hello, Gigi?
mom, is that you? Yes.
I can't talk now, I'll call you back.
wait, I need you to...
Hi, it's Janine. Leave a message.
Hi, Janine, it's me.
Conor never called...
...so I'm on the precipice of staging a casual run-in at the city Supper club.
pick up if you wanna stop me.
all right, I'm interpreting your silence as tacit compliance.
Bye.
what's up, girl?
how are you? Good.
knock, knock.
Hey.
so...
...Here we are. Same shift again.
I know. I make the schedule. Remember?
well, I figured it was no coincidence.
I had...
...a good time the other night.
Yeah.
it's amazing where 10 shots of Patron will get you.
so I was thinking...
...after work we could...
you know...
look, Kelli Ann, what happened between us the other night was fun.
it was definitely fun.
but we're way understaffed tonight.
I even have to man the bar.
so that's why I scheduled you.
to work.
so...
are we good?
Nope, we're good. Okay.
Hey, oh, Kelli Ann.
Hey, babe, could you get the door? Thanks.
Hi. Are you joining us for dinner, or?
I'm meeting someone. A guy.
Why?
nothing. Sorry. For dinner?
I'll wait at the bar.
that's a great idea.
what can I get you?
Oh, no, I'm meeting someone.
Oh yeah? What, you got a hot date?
I don't know if you'd call it "hot.
this guy conor and I have only been out one time...
wait, wait, wait. Conor Barry?
Yeah.
Conor's not coming in tonight. Thanks a lot.
did he forget he was supposed to meet you here?
Oh, see, when I said "meeting someone,
I guess it was kind of a broad term.
a wide interpretation of the word "meeting.
right. You know what? I'll call him.
Oh, no. I mean, just totally unnecessary.
okay.
I just was actually in the area...
and so I just figured I'd swing by and see if he was around.
because I had to return his pen.
had to return this pen. He left this.
and I just thought I should really return it before he, you know, freaks out.
Yeah. Okay, I'll get it to him.
Thanks.
Wilson Ward, DDS, child,
adult and Geriatric Dentistry.
look, I'm not going to judge what may or may not be important to someone.
Yeah. That's not even his dentist, though.
Oh, really. Who is?
my dad.
I'm Gigi. I went out with conor last week.
and I just...
I thought if I just ran into him...
I don't know. I'm gonna go.
wait.
wait, just...
hang out for a second. Let me buy you a drink.
one drink. Okay?
give me two seconds, I'll be right back.
look, you seem like a cool girl, so I'm just gonna be honest with you.
Conor's never gonna call you.
Oh, really. How do you know?
because I'm a guy, and it's just how we do it.
he said it was nice meeting me.
I don't care if he said you were his favorite female...
...since his mommy and Joanie cunningham.
over a week went by, okay, Gigi? And he didn't call you.
but maybe he did call and I didn't get the message.
or maybe he lost my number...
or he's out of town, or got hit by a cab, or his grandma died.
or he didn't call because he has no interest in seeing you again.
Yeah. But my friend Terri once went out with a guy who never called.
she totally wrote him off.
over a year goes by. Right.
she ran into him, and it ended up that...
your friend Terri's an idiot. She's also the exception...
...By the way. The rare exception.
okay. Okay. But what if I'm the exception?
no, you're not. You're not at all. In fact, you're the rule.
and the rule is this: If a guy doesn't call you, he doesn't wanna call you.
Really? Yeah.
always? Yeah, always.
look, I know what blowing off a woman looks like, okay?
I do it early, I do it often.
so trust me when I say if a guy is treating you like he doesn't give a shit ...he genuinely doesn't give a shit.
no exceptions.
thank you.
given me a lot to think about.
morning, morning.
Hi. Hi.
everything okay?
Oh, I was up all night.
please say you were working on the nutmeg copy.
sure. It's basically done.
I have to tell you something important.
sweetie? What's going on with your hair?
Yeah, come here before people see you have a mini muffin in your hair.
okay.
so...
thank you. I think I figured it out.
remember that notary public who cheated on me?
then Anastasia told me her boyfriend.
cheated on her at the beginning.
but then he changed and now they're married and crazy in love?
I thought that guy was a process server. No, notary.
anyway, my point is,
Anastasia's the exception, not the rule.
we have to stop listening to these stories.
the rule is that guys who cheat on you don't care about you much.
okay. Okay, so Exhibit A:
Chad, the drummer who lived in a storage space.
he only used me for rides, and yet I continued to stalk him for most of 1998.
and then... oh, there was Don...
...who broke up with me every Friday so that he could have his weekends free.
I was delusional about that relationship.
I'd refer to him as my husband to my dental hygienist.
and all of my friends used to tell me stories...
...about how things might work out with these dipshits ...
...because they knew someone who dated a dipshit like mine...
...and that girl ended up getting married.
but that's the exception.
we're not the exception, we're the rule.
okay, let me just see if I understand.
so what you're saying is...
...if I hear a story about a girl who's been with a guy for 13 years...
...and he finally married her, that's the exception.
Yes.
but the rule are guys like Neil...
...who are with girls like me...
...for seven years and aren't married...
...they're never getting married.
no. No.
no, no, no. No, no, no. No.
it's not what she meant in that...
no, it's got nothing to do with you.
I absolutely was not talking about you.
these are specific relationship situations.
I was talking about myself specifically.
just me specifically, you know?
this guy is, like, impossible not to like, you know?
he's flirting with me pretty heavily outside of the Handy Mart...
...and, you know, everything just kind of lines up, it's really magical.
and then he tells me that he's married.
which, of course, I should be pissed about, right?
but I just can't stop thinking about him.
but he's married.
I know, I realize that. I don't know what's wrong with me.
what's wrong with me?
okay.
I know this guy, he works in my dad's printing business.
and he was married for 15 years to a nice lady.
and one night he meets this woman at some church event.
and he tells my dad that he's never felt anything like it before.
that he had finally met the one.
so he divorced his wife...
...and he's been with this other woman for 22 years...
...and they're insanely happy.
I mean, what if you meet the love of your life...
...but you already married someone else?
are you supposed to let them pass you by?
you're right. Okay.
I'm gonna call him.
okay.
Hello? Hey, Ben. This is Anna Marks.
Hey, Anna. What's up?
nothing, I was just... I was taking you up on your offer.
I know you said you had a couple of contacts you thought could help me.
and I thought maybe we could talk about it over coffee or something like that.
look, I just...
I can't, Anna.
you seemed great. I just... I don't know.
I should probably go.
take care, though. Bye.
I'm psyched you called. Cool.
kind of given up on you when you didn't call me back.
I was just thinking about you.
want a glass of wine? Sure.
okay, what were the categories again?
four categories:
smart, sexy, funny and cute.
but you can only be two things.
like Sarah Jessica Parker would be funny and sexy.
bill clinton would be smart and sexy.
I can't believe you're hot for clinton.
go. What am I?
wait, what was I again?
you're smart and cute.
okay, you are sexy, very sexy.
and cute.
no, you can't...
sexy and cute are both in the looks column.
nobody wants to be all in one column.
I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four, which obviously you are.
especially sexy.
you're the best.
I better go.
okay, well, you know you could stay here if you want.
what? It's been a while.
no, I can't.
I can't stay, I'm totally...
I'm totally, totally fried.
is that okay?
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Bye.
Hey.
that look straight to you?
why are you hanging that?
because you asked me to about three weeks ago.
I'm getting around to it.
Why? You don't want it here?
no, I love it there. But just stop.
Why? Is it the painting?
you know, I know, it looks kind of like a deflated boob here.
right? I know.
it's gonna be depressing. Should I take it down?
no, I want you to stop doing anything nice.
this feels like a trick.
no. No?
no, I just... I just need you to stop being nice to me...
...unless you're gonna marry me after.
is that funny?
do you think that's funny?
no, I guess it's not funny.
see, you can't keep being nice to me...
...and I can't keep pretending that this is something that it's not.
we've been together for over seven years.
you know me, you know who I am.
you either wanna marry me or you don't.
or there's the possibility...
...that I mean it when I say I don't believe in marriage...
bullshit.
come on, it's bullshit for every woman...
...that has been told by some man that he doesn't believe in marriage...
...and then six months later he's married to some 24-year-old that he met at a gym.
it's just... It's bullshit.
where is this coming from?
from the place I've been hiding from you for about five years.
okay.
five years, because I haven't wanted to seem demanding.
and I haven't wanted to seem clingy or psycho.
or whatever.
so I haven't asked you.
but I...
I have to.
I mean...
...are you ever gonna marry me?
Oh, I can't do this anymore.
I used to think that I had never been dumped.
Yeah, then we started comparing notes.
then we realized we've both been dumped by every man we've ever been with.
every one. Yeah.
but they do it so skillfully.
they just so sneaky that you think it was your idea.
Yeah. You're sitting back and you're like:
Oh, yeah. This my idea.
but wait a second, why am I alone?
why am I unhappy? Why have I gained 20 pounds?
they Jedi mind-trick you. Yes, they do.
so they do a soft pass.
they got little lines they like to tell you.
like, "I don't wanna stand in your way.
or, "You're perfect, it's just I have to work on myself.
right. "I'm just thinking of your happiness.
Oh, I don't deserve you." That's my favorite one.
you know the other one I like?
I am so jealous of the guy who gets to marry you.
well, that could have been you. Yeah.
that's what I was leaning towards.
Yeah. And the second you hear that...
...run to the store, get yourself some ribs and some ice cream...
...because you have been dumped.
hey Anna, it's Ben.
listen, I know it's been a while since you called.
it's just... It took me by surprise.
but I did offer to help you with your career...
...and I don't see why I can't do that, right?
so why don't you give me a call...
...and maybe you can come by the office or something.
okay? All right, take care. Bye.
Hey, you.
Oh, shit.
what? You scared me.
you okay? Yeah.
everything's fine.
are you smoking again?
no, sweetie, I'm not smoking.
Why?
you get jumpy when you smoke.
I'm not smoking, I promise.
no, I was just sitting here...
...trying to picture what this room's gonna look like when it's finished.
I like that game. You do?
Yeah.
what color did you picture?
that's where I got stuck.
Yeah.
I was thinking...
...maybe yellow.
yellow? Okay. Yeah. I mean, it's neutral.
Yeah. So it could be whatever.
it could be an office, it could be a guest room...
...a gym, a baby's room...
wait, did you mean "neutral," or "gender-neutral"?
I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, really?
I know we said we'd wait to talk about it.
but I think that we're almost ready to start talking about it.
so that's the last time I do anything pro bono.
well, ladies, I guess I have to get back to the office.
you go back to the office after happy hour?
what's happy about that?
I met you.
I would love to call you sometime. Do you have a card?
of course. Oh, great.
here is my info.
nice to meet you, Janine. Nice to meet you.
look forward to hearing from you, Gigi.
Oh, wait.
so...
...how are we doing this?
are you hearing from me or am I getting a call?
what?
you said you'd love to call me...
but then you said, "Look forward to hearing from you," and...
you see how that's kind of confusing?
Yeah, look, we'll talk. We'll get in touch.
you did it again. Very vague.
you know what? Let's just say that you'll call me...
...and then we can skip all the nonsense.
goodbye, Gigi.
he was cute. Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him.
what are you doing?
I'm not calling him.
if he wants to see me, he'll call.
that guy Alex really made an impression on you.
was he hot?
no. He was just...
...right.
morning.
morning, Ryan.
a surprise mocha venti just because you're so awesome.
love you. Love you.
good morning.
okay.
so?
Oh, hi.
he asked me out. Oh, my God. He called?
he e-mailed?
no. What?
left his calling card with your lady-in-waiting?
he MySpaced me.
Oh, girl, I don't know about that.
my trampy little sister says MySpace is the new booty call.
well, what am I supposed to do?
I mean, things have changed.
people don't meet each other organically anymore.
if I would like to make myself seem more attractive to the opposite sex...
...I don't go and get a new haircut, I update my profile.
that's just the way it is, you know?
Yeah, she's right.
back, back, back, back.
ad sales, this is Mary.
Hi, Mary, this is conor, Anna's friend, or whatever.
Hi.
so, what'd you think?
looking at it right now. I'm not sure about this.
Oh, you have to trust me.
it's a burgeoning market, you're gonna make a fortune.
I know. Did you have to put me with the massage ads?
well, it was either that or the page with the personals, so...
this page gets a lot of action.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?
Yeah.
okay.
all right, Mary, I'll talk to you soon. Thank you.
Bye.
what I'm trying to show you is that there's a difference.
there is a difference.
Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda to sew these dresses in two weeks?
she wanted to do it.
Really? She told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.
is that not right? No, she didn't.
no?
what's the...? Why the big rush to get married?
because I am not having my wedding during a gross Baltimore winter...
...and I am not waiting till spring.
you are so pregnant.
Oh, God, I'm not pregnant.
I'm not pregnant. That's ridiculous.
chug a beer then. No, I'm not chugging a beer.
chug a beer.
we're in love, you assholes.
that's what people do when they're in love, they get married.
but you know what? Not everybody gets married, you know?
there are many people who never get married.
well, thanks for the inspirational pep talk.
what she meant to say was that it's fine that you broke up with Neil.
right.
tons of people make the choice to be alone. They're happy.
look at Al Pacino.
never been married, happy as a clam.
would that...? Am l? Would I be Al Pacino in this scenario?
no, Bethie, we just... we want you to be happy.
well, then you should have rethought the coral.
Oh, her face.
your face. Don't make her cry.
I'm sick of these coral jokes.
I know, you're sensitive. Trust me, I get it.
Hey, why don't you have dinner with me and Steven and the kids...
...then you can just stay over...?
why'd she wanna hang out with you and your husband?
the last thing I'd feel like doing.
if being in this wedding is too painful...
Oh, God, you guys. Please, stop it. Relax, relax.
that's enough, okay? Seriously, you guys, I'm f...
I've gone through breakups before.
if you remember, I handle them quite well.
you've been there, you've seen it.
I'm perfectly capable of doing this.
I can do it again.
I want you to stop worrying about me.
I'm fine.
I know it's here somewhere.
I spoke with George Lane in Music.
he had a whole list of references for you.
well, that's okay. You can just call me when you find it.
I swear I didn't lure you here under false pretenses.
I know.
a girl can dream, though.
you're just too good a guy.
why are you married again?
seriously, why?
no, I really think that it would be good for me to know...
...why you cannot live without this other woman.
well, we'd been together since college and she gave me an ultimatum.
she said, "Either we get married or we break up.
so we got married.
Wow. You caved.
it's complicated.
Really?
what? You're a dick if you date a girl for too long and don't marry her.
you marry her and you're an asshole for marrying before you're ready.
I mean, shit, I don't know.
you're really hot.
and I am obviously attracted to you.
so I think the best I can do is...
...eventually find this piece of paper and call you...
and hope to just help you out in your career in some small way.
Hi.
Hi. What's going on?
Javier.
Javier, I thought we talked about tarping the furniture.
city Supper.
Hi, this is Gigi. Is Alex there?
hold on.
Alex?
drinks are good? Yeah, one more.
Hello? Hi, this is Gigi.
Gigi? Gigi Phillips.
I, um...
...had the dentist pen.
right. Hey. How you doing?
I'm really sorry to bug you. That's okay.
you had some really good insights and I wanted to ask you a question.
okay, look, now I need to be harsh with you.
Conor's never gonna be interested in you, Geege.
no, I know. This is about Jarrad.
Jarrad.
so we meet at happy hour and he's completely charming...
Hey, give me two seconds, okay? Two seconds, hold on.
let me guess. He said:
the only thing happy about this hour is you.
he might have used some derivative of that.
so he says he's going to call, but then he gives me his card and he says...
Oh, he's not interested.
you don't even know if he's called.
Oh, did he?
no.
but I honestly think he's expect... okay.
Gigi, he is not interested.
Alex, this is jacked.
the hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a black shirt.
it's not black. Look at it.
not a black shirt. I see it. It's not black.
this shit is black.
if a guy gives you his phone number instead of taking yours, he's not interested.
he took mine first. Then he gave...
and also, if a guy wants to see you, believe me, he will see you.
I once called 55 Lauren Bells until I got the right one.
that's cute.
what happened?
Oh, yeah, as it turns out, her ass looked really huge in the daylight.
is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women?
don't call him. He doesn't like you.
don't tiptoe around my feelings.
well, I'm just trying to help. I know. Thank you.
sure.
I gotta get back to work, but good luck.
okay, bye.
Hey, buddy, you home?
Yeah. Come on in.
Hey, you want a beer?
or an apple martini?
Oh, that's funny.
have you told your parents?
it's for work. I'm trying to expand my client base.
by pretending to be gay?
no, by being more gay-friendly.
or, in real estate terms, "gay-adjacent.
nice. I'm gonna use that.
I should change this. It's maybe a little much.
I don't know. Dressing like that, seeing a girl who won't sleep with you...
...I think you can pull it off.
it's not that she won't sleep with me, douche bag.
I have slept with her. It's just she, you know...
won't sleep with you anymore.
pretty much, yeah.
what do you think?
I think you got a problem...
because you're gonna have to beat them away with a stick, you gorgeous, sexy man.
holy shit.
observe your breath.
inhale, belly rise.
and exhale, belly fall.
bring your hands together in front of your chest.
bow your head in gratitude.
Namaste. Namaste.
thank you for coming. See you next week.
great class.
we ran into each other.
you came to my class.
I had no idea this was your class.
you called to ask me if this was my class.
no, you never called back.
because you told me not to call you if it was my class. It was.
no. We just ran into each other. Okay.
we're just two innocent folks who happen to be working out near each other.
exactly.
do you want a swim?
sure.
you know, I was just thinking...
...why can't we be friends?
I mean, am I not allowed to have friends anymore?
I mean, am I not allowed to be friends with people that are hot?
I mean, what kind of reverse prejudice is that?
I hear you.
I mean...
...am I not supposed to be friends with a guy just because he's married?
right.
or has an insane smile?
or an ass that makes me wanna dry hump?
did you just say "dry hump"? Yeah.
think I just fell in love.
so we're friends.
Yeah.
you wanna come in?
I'm sorry, I don't trust myself.
that's okay. You can just watch.
you know, you may be the best friend I've ever had.
take a shower
honey? Yeah.
you smell weird.
I smell weird? Yeah, different.
different how? I don't know.
sort of an odd thing to say.
you know, maybe it was the ashtray and cigarettes I found.
in the back yard.
what part of "My dad died of lung cancer..."
...is so hard for you to wrap your brain around?
what?
do not lie to me, Ben. Please, okay?
are you serious?
we have, like, 8000 undocumented workers here daily.
okay, and you find an ashtray with cigarettes in it and you think...
you automatically assume that they're mine.
Oh, yeah.
honey, I'm not lying to you.
I think...
...you are really freaking out.
this whole renovation thing's getting to you because nothing's happening.
just say no.
get it out.
gonna take a shower.
I'm exhausted. Okay.
sorry. It's all right.
who'd have thought that a random girl from yoga...
...would fix me up with such a good kisser?
back at you, sister.
I can't wait to kiss you again.
but we're kissing right now.
I know, next time.
the second-date kiss is way more intimate.
well, listen...
...l'm leaving tomorrow, so I'll be out of touch for a little bit.
can you excuse me a quick second? Too many Diet cokes.
okay.
yeah?
Hey, sorry to bug you again. Quick question.
excuse me one minute, babe. Sorry.
what's going on?
okay, I'm making out with this guy... PG stuff.
and he mentions that he's going out of town, he's gonna be out of touch.
run.
but maybe he is going out of town.
where? Where's he going that he's gonna be out of touch?
where are you going out of town to again?
um... Uh... Pittsburgh.
pittsburgh.
run.
so, what, now I'm just supposed to run from every guy who doesn't like me?
Yeah.
there's not gonna be anybody left.
I don't know why I'm saying this...
...but I think I know a nice guy who might actually like you.
yeah? Yeah.
he's friends with my brother. His name's Bill.
we'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.
so, I mean, I'm in his bathroom right now.
what do I do?
well, you gotta come out eventually, right?
but I'd take my time in there.
I'd let him sweat.
Thanks. Good luck.
Yeah, the boat looks great.
you look like shit.
but your boat looks great.
Yeah. I live on my boat, man.
personal hygiene goes out the window.
a lot of time to work on the place.
you should try working on a shower.
Yeah.
Hey, what can I tell you?
standing on principle, man. It's all I got.
cigarette?
no, I'm good.
that's right, you quit.
good for you.
so did Janine send you out here to check up on me?
Yeah, pretty much.
what are you gonna tell her?
I'll tell her how gorgeous you look out here on the ocean.
break.
any word from Beth?
she's so busy organizing her sister's funeral,
I think she must be...
sister's what?
her wedding. Her sister's wedding.
isn't that what I said? No. You said "funeral.
no, I didn't. Yes, you did.
that's so weird.
I don't understand why people wanna get married.
they don't.
they don't? No.
no, no guy actually wants to get married.
and if they do, all they're really thinking about?
all the women they're gonna miss out on.
I don't wanna be with anybody else, just Beth.
I don't know, man, I...
why'd you get married?
I love Janine.
you're a happily married guy.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd say so.
now, I know I don't need to tell any of you...
...that my cousin Paige is hot.
in high school, if I told the popular guys that Paige was my cousin...
...it'd keep me from getting my ass kicked...
...because no one wanted to blow their chances with her.
and when she gets up there and says those marriage vows to Devon...
...there will be hearts breaking all over the world.
that's sweet.
but, you know, keep in mind that her sister Beth is still on the market.
Yeah, sure, she may be an older model...
...but she got a lot of good miles left in that tank.
but don't stay on the lot too long...
...or next year's models are gonna slip in there and steal all...
okay, that's enough of the speeches.
okay.
so enjoy the crab.
and that yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it's the crab's hepatopancreas.
Bethie.
your cousin Jay has always been a jackass.
I know.
and somehow even he's married.
Oh, honey, look.
back when everyone was just going to camp at the Y...
...you borrowed my New York Times...
...found some arts camp in the Berkshires...
...wrote away for information and got accepted on your own.
you never did things like everyone else.
why not?
because that's you.
that's why you're my favorite daughter.
you're not supposed to say that.
I don't give a shit.
I'm retired, I'll say what I want to.
I'll say it to the whole room if you want.
wait, wait, wait! Come here. Stop.
it's true, though.
what are you doing? Waiting for you.
come on.
sorry I'm late.
no, it's okay.
I like a little time before a blind date.
prepare myself mentally, remind myself not to tell the story about my molars...
Gigi, he's not coming.
but you can tell me the story about the molars.
I'd love to hear it.
how could he already not like me?
I screwed up.
I told Bill it was Thursday, not Tuesday. It's my fault.
Hi. Are you good?
can I get a Jameson on the rocks? Sure.
awesome. I'm stuck with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.
meanwhile, this girl, she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak.
this one right here?
Oh, God, no.
how do you know?
the guy working the Tom Cruise thing?
she's interested, he's clearly not.
you cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not into her.
actually, I can. I see this stuff going on every night.
watch this. She's going on about her macrobiotic diet.
he's thinking, "Dear christ, get me out of here.
and look, how fortuitous.
drinks spill, which is perfect for him, because now...
he can move on to the girl with the shoulder tattoo.
man, you have a gift.
now check out Droopy Dog on the other side.
he's gonna buy her drinks all night and she's still gonna insist there's no spark.
maybe there's not. You need a spark.
Oh, the spark thing is bullshit.
Really? Bullshit.
enlighten me.
guys invented the spark...
...so they could not call and treat you kind of badly and keep you guessing...
...then convince you that that anxiety and fear that just develops naturally...
...was actually just a spark.
and you guys all buy it. You eat it up and you love it.
you love it because you feed off that drama.
you all love that drama.
I don't.
so you never wait until the last minute on a deadline or a phone bill...
...because secretly you love the drama...
...of not knowing whether or not you're gonna make it?
maybe.
and let me guess:
when you were stalking conor the other night...
...were you obsessing about him calling...
...constantly pacing back and forth, staring at your phone for days...
...even though the date was just kind of mediocre?
okay. Yeah.
because you all thrive on the drama. Thank you.
look, you gotta be more like me.
if a girl likes me, great.
but if not, there are plenty more out there like her, you know?
with smaller pores and bigger implants.
that's beautiful. I know.
why are you sharing all of this inside dating information with me again?
I don't know, I like you.
you do?
well, yeah. Okay, don't start doodling my name on your binder, okay?
I just mean, I mean, I like you the way I like basset hounds.
something pathetic about them. You just wanna cheer them up.
again with the sensitivity.
to sensitivity.
a girl will never forget the first boy she likes.
even if things don't quite work out.
why did you do that?
because you smell like dog poo.
you're so stupid, just like dog poo.
you're made out of poo!
but usually someone is there to offer words of wisdom.
made...
...of...
...dog...
...poo.
honey...
...do you know why that little boy did those things and said those things?
it's because he likes you.
GIGl: And there it is.
that's the beginning of our problem.
that little boy is doing those terrible things because he's got a crush on you.
GIGl: Do you know what this means?
we're all encouraged...
...no, programmed...
...to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk...
...that means he likes you.
here's the problem: He likes you too much.
you're too pretty and too awesome.
Yes. - He can't handle it.
that Phi Delt so obviously liked you.
I'm sure he just lost your number.
he's not asking you out because he's intimidated by your professional success.
GIGl: Why do we say this stuff to each other?
is it possible that it's because we're too scared...
...and it's too hard to say the one obvious truth...
...that's staring everyone in the face?
so Janine says you're a real-estate agent.
Yeah, but I'm not one of those cheesy ones...
...that puts my headshots on bus benches and grocery carts.
so just, like, Frisbees and notepads?
basically.
it's much classier. - My thoughts exactly.
wonder why Janine never thought to introduce us before.
I don't know. I don't know.
Hey, guys. Want another round? - You want one more?
only if you do. I mean, if you need to get going, I totally...
uh...
okay, well...
sure. One more. Ketel and soda?
and a beer, please.
be right back.
well, Conor, I had a really nice time. - It was really nice meeting you.
Bye. - See you.
Hey, it's me.
he's cute, and I think it went well.
and I think he might be leaving me a message at home as we speak.
Hey, it's me. Just wanted to let you know I was thinking about you.
Oh, that's very sweet of you, Conor. Thanks.
listen, I was wondering if you wanted to grab a late bite.
tonight? I...
no, I was supposed to meet friends but I'm burnt out. Don't be mad at me.
no, of course, I'm not mad. Well, I'll be up for a while.
do you wanna go ahead of me? - I'll be up.
Oh, can you hold on? - Okay.
no, that's fine. You just have one thing, so...
no, technically I have six...
...and I'm mulling over a gum purchase, so I think you should go.
okay.
let me call you right back.
all right. Okay.
Hi. - Hey.
just that and that, please.
thank you.
Oh, my word.
Seriously? That's not possible.
I just deposited cash three days ago, so it's just not possible.
Oh, it's not that. Let me check something.
congratulations, you won.
what?
our Funky Fall promotion. You're our 1000th customer this month.
what?
are you kidding me?
I don't do kidding.
Oh, my God. I can't believe this, it's so exciting.
Oh, my God. I never won anything before.
this is the most exciting thing that ever happened to me. Is that sad?
Yea- No. I don't think so.
Really? - Yes.
thank you! Come here.
Wow.
as the Terps move to mid-ice, trying to...
Hey. - Hey.
how was the date? - It was fine. Whatever.
why are you here? - My cable's out.
come on, Spiewak, it's not the Ice Capades.
you didn't hear the phone ring by any chance, did you?
no, I didn't. - Shit.
Anna gave me the old, "I'll call you right back.
Oh, shit, yeah? Well, how long ago?
that was 22 minutes ago.
do I call back?
should you call back? No, absolutely not.
I'm gonna call back and say I'm going to bed.
what? No. It's 9: 30. You're gonna-?
no, it's a great idea.
I'll call and say, "In case you were gonna call me back, don't...
...because I'll be sleeping. " A genius idea.
okay, no, that's brilliant.
when you wake up you can say, "I'm awake now, I'm available to take your call.
Oh, gosh. A second.
sorry about that. - It's all right.
I was
wait, what was I saying again?
you don't wanna be like your mother, wake up one morning...
...and realize you never pursued your dreams.
is that what I was saying?
you want some gum? - No, thank you.
God, that's kind of heavy for a grocery chat.
no, that's okay. - Isn't it?
sorry. - I actually might be able to help.
Yeah, I know a guy at my office who deals exclusively with music clients.
are you kidding? - Uh-uh.
Oh, my God.
are you my savior or something? - No.
can you hold this for a second? - Yeah.
Oh, this is so unexpected.
okay...
I don't...
I'm married.
I don't do this.
you don't do what? You don't help struggling singers?
not hot yoga-instructing singers...
...who are incredibly charming.
hm.
well, you could- You could give me your card.
that's legit, right? Is that allowed?
I could do that.
Yeah. - That'd be okay, right?
Yeah.
great, thank you so much.
course. Do you need help to your car?
Where'd you park? - No, I'm fine. It's okay.
it was very nice to meet you. - Yeah.
okay.
who was that?
Oh, that was a prospective client. - Oh.
okay.
I can talk to a woman. It doesn't have to be like that.
no. Absolutely not.
just drive. - Relax.
Hi. - Hi.
how you doing? - Good.
yeah? - Yeah. I just got off the phone.
yeah? - Yeah, with my little sister.
how's she doing? - She's getting married.
Really?
Yeah.
great.
you really think that's great?
Yeah.
Devon seems like...
...a great guy.
well, so you think it's great that they're getting married...
...but you don't ever feel like we're going against nature, or something...
...By not getting married?
no.
going against nature is like the cat who suckled that monkey.
you and I are just two people who happen not to be married.
let me tell you something. People who get married are not to be trusted.
you are so weird.
they're not. You know why?
because if you are so legitimately happy, honestly...
...you wouldn't feel the need to make a big show out of it.
you wouldn't have to broadcast it.
they do it because they're insecure...
...and they think getting married's what they're supposed to be doing.
so they're lying to themselves and to other people.
seriously.
think about you and your friends. Okay?
these women you have great relationships with...
...you're close to them, some of them you've known for years.
but you don't feel the need...
...to write a $45 check to the state of Maryland for a friendship certificate.
Yeah. No, I get that. - Right?
why should it be any different, you know, with me and you?
we're very happy, I love you, I'm committed to you...
...we have a great life, you know?
Yes, you're right.
why can't we just be happy?
you're right.
I'm gonna get you some more tea. - Okay.
please enter your pass
you have no messages.
main menu. To send a message
okay, so clearly he hasn't called.
maybe he's away on business.
he sells real estate. In Baltimore.
staying in town is his business. - Right.
well, look, let me tell you.
after I went out with Ben for the first time, he didn't call me for 11 days.
eleven days. And now he's the world's best husband.
that happens all the time.
Really? - Really.
you want coffee?
I got you 2 percent. - Thanks.
this is all your fault.
what? Why?
you set us up.
no. You asked me if I know any guys, and I gave Conor your phone number.
that's not a setup.
when I do a setup, I weigh the pros and cons.
I do my due diligence.
all I know about Conor is that he sold us this house.
seriously, stop.
he said he always hangs out after work at the City Supper Club.
maybe I should do a little drive-by?
please don't.
he'll call.
okay, I have a question:
why'd they even invent caller ID?
it's, like, who is this service helping?
I mean, for centuries...
okay, well maybe not centuries, but for, like, a lot and lot of years...
...people have been answering their phone, not knowing who it is...
...and as far as I can tell, no one's died from that.
and it's like if the police wanna know who placed a call, they could trace it.
I mean, what am I, the police?
this constant obsession with needing to know who's calling all the time...
...it's, like, so gross.
like, you pick up the phone, you find out who it is, then you know.
it's, like...
look, all I'm saying...
...if a guy doesn't call me, I would like to reserve the right...
...to call him at 15-minute intervals until he picks up.
but if he looks down and sees my numbers...
...he's gonna think I'm some kind of psycho or something.
which I'm not.
obviously.
Hello?
mom.
I gotta call you back.
inhale. Upward-facing dog.
look up towards the ceiling.
look up towards the ceiling.
he ordered more drinks for us when the waitress came.
he remembered exactly what I wanted.
he initiated the hug. He said it was nice meeting me.
so wait. This was at the end of the date or the beginning of the date?
end. Why, does it matter?
Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning of the date, that's normal.
nice meeting you" at the end of the date...
it could be a blowoff.
maybe it was at the beginning.
okay. That's fine. He's gonna call.
or maybe it was at the end.
or maybe it was just nice to meet me.
help.
Hi. This is torture.
how am I supposed to come up with something pithy and dynamic...
...to say about cinnamon blends?
it's hard to focus on nutmeg...
...when the guy who might be the guy of my dreams...
...refuses to call me.
after my first date with Neil...
...I called him.
there are no rules anymore.
and, I mean, why should you have to wait for him to get off his ass?
it's ringing. - That's pretty standard.
Hey, you've reached Conor. - Yes! Voicemail.
leave a message, I'll get back to you. - Notes.
Hey, Conor, it's Gigi.
I just thought, I hadn't heard from you...
...and how stupid is it that a gal has to wait for a guy's call anyway, right?
what does that say? What's that say?
because we're all equal, right?
more than equal.
more women are accepted into law school now than men.
and, I mean, I don't know if you saw that Dateline...
...but women practically have penises now, right? So...
call me.
Oh, this is Gigi. Call me.
don't worry, he's totally gonna call.
what?
how can there not be a dial tone? How can there not be a dial tone?
no dial tone. Come here, dial tone.
Gigi, are you there?
Hello, Gigi?
mom, is that you? - Yes.
I can't talk now, I'll call you back. - Wait, I need you to
Hi, it's Janine. Leave a message.
Hi, Janine, it's me.
Conor never called...
...so I'm on the precipice of staging a casual run-in at the City Supper Club.
pick up if you wanna stop me.
all right, I'm interpreting your silence as tacit compliance. Bye.
what's up, girl? - Hey.
how are you? - Good.
knock, knock.
Hey.
so...
...Here we are. Same shift again.
I know. I make the schedule. Remember?
well, I figured it was no coincidence.
I had...
...a good time the other night.
Yeah.
so I was thinking...
...after work we could...
you know...
look, Kelli Ann, what happened between us the other night was fun.
it was definitely fun.
but we're way understaffed tonight. I even have to man the bar.
so that's why I scheduled you.
to work.
so...
are we good?
Nope, we're good. - Okay.
Hey, oh, Kelli Ann.
Hey, babe, could you get the door? Thanks.
Hi. Are you joining us for dinner, or...?
I'm meeting someone. A guy.
Why? - Hm?
nothing. Sorry. For dinner?
I'll wait at the bar.
that's a great idea.
what can I get you?
Oh, no, I'm meeting someone.
Oh yeah? What, you got a hot date?
I don't know if you'd call it "hot.
this guy Conor and I have only been out one time
wait, wait, wait. Conor Barry?
Yeah.
Conor's not coming in tonight. Thanks a lot.
did he forget he was supposed to meet you here?
Oh, see, when I said "meeting someone," I guess it was kind of a broad term.
a wide interpretation of the word "meeting.
right. You know what? I'll call him.
Oh, no. I mean, just totally unnecessary.
okay.
I just was actually in the area...
...and so I just figured I'd swing by and see if he was around.
because I had to return his pen.
had to return this pen. He left this.
and I just thought I should really return it before he, you know, freaks out.
Yeah. Okay, I'll get it to him.
Thanks.
Wilson Ward, DDS, Adult, Child and Geriatric Dentistry.
look, I'm not going to judge what may or may not be important to someone.
Yeah. That's not even his dentist, though.
Oh, really. Who is?
my dad.
Oh.
I'm Gigi. I went out with Conor last week.
and I just...
I thought if I just ran into him...
I don't know. I'm gonna go.
wait.
wait, just
hang out for a second. Let me buy you a drink.
one drink. Okay?
give me two seconds, I'll be right back.
look, you seem like a cool girl, so I'm just gonna be honest with you.
Conor's never gonna call you.
Oh, really. How do you know?
because I'm a guy, and it's just how we do it.
he said it was nice meeting me.
I don't care if he said you were his favorite female...
...since his mommy and Joanie Cunningham.
over a week went by, okay, Gigi? And he didn't call you.
but maybe he did call and I didn't get the message.
or maybe he lost my number...
...or he's out of town, or got hit by a cab, or his grandma died.
or he didn't call because he has no interest in seeing you again.
Yeah. But my friend Terri once went out with a guy who never called.
she totally wrote him off.
over a year goes by. - Right.
she ran into him, and it ended up that
your friend Terri's an idiot. She's also the exception...
...By the way. The rare exception.
okay. Okay. But what if I'm the exception?
no, you're not. You're not at all. In fact, you're the rule.
and the rule is this: If a guy doesn't call you, he doesn't wanna call you.
Really? - Yeah.
always? - Yeah, always.
look, I know what blowing off a woman looks like, okay?
I do it early, I do it often.
so trust me when I say if a guy is treating you like he doesn't give a shit...
...he genuinely doesn't give a shit.
no exceptions.
thank you.
given me a lot to think about.
morning, morning. Excuse me.
Hi. - Hi.
everything okay?
Oh, I was up all night.
please say you were working on the nutmeg copy.
sure. It's basically done. I have to tell you something important.
sweetie? What's going on with your hair?
Yeah, come here before people see you have a mini muffin in your hair.
okay.
so...
thank you. I think I figured it out.
remember that notary public who cheated on me?
then Anastasia told me her boyfriend cheated on her at the beginning...
...but then he changed and now they're married and crazy in love?
I thought that guy was a process server. - No, notary.
anyway, my point is, Anastasia's the exception, not the rule.
we have to stop listening to these stories.
the rule is that guys who cheat on you don't care about you much.
okay. - Okay, so Exhibit A:
Chad, the drummer who lived in a storage space.
he only used me for rides, and yet I continued to stalk him for most of 1998.
and then... Oh, there was Don...
...who broke up with me every Friday so that he could have his weekends free.
I was delusional about that relationship.
I'd refer to him as my husband to my dental hygienist.
and all of my friends used to tell me stories...
...about how things might work out with these dipshits...
...because they knew someone who dated a dipshit like mine...
...and that girl ended up getting married.
but that's the exception. We're not the exception, we're the rule.
okay, let me just see if I understand.
so what you're saying is...
...if I hear a story about a girl who's been with a guy for 13 years...
...and he finally married her, that's the exception.
Yes.
but the rule are guys like Neil...
...who are with girls like me...
...for seven years and aren't married...
...they're never getting married.
no. - No.
no, no, no. No, no, no. - No.
it's not what she meant in that- - No, it's got nothing to do with you.
I absolutely was not talking about you.
these are specific relationship situations. - I was talking about myself specifically.
GIGl: Just me specifically, you know?
this guy is, like, impossible not to like, you know?
he's flirting with me pretty heavily outside of the Handy Mart...
...and, you know, everything just kind of lines up, it's really magical.
and then he tells me that he's married.
which, of course, I should be pissed about, right?
but I just can't stop thinking about him.
but he's married.
I know, I realize that. I don't know what's wrong with me.
what's wrong with me?
okay.
I know this guy, he works in my dad's printing business.
and he was married for 15 years to a nice lady.
and one night he meets this woman at some church event.
and he tells my dad that he's never felt anything like it before.
that he had finally met the one.
so he divorced his wife...
...and he's been with this other woman for 22 years...
...and they're insanely happy.
I mean, what if you meet the love of your life...
...but you already married someone else?
are you supposed to let them pass you by?
you're right. Okay.
I'm gonna call him.
okay.
Hello? - Hey, Ben. This is Anna Marks.
Hey, Anna. What's up?
nothing, I was just- I was taking you up on your offer.
I know you said you had a couple of contacts you thought could help me.
and I thought maybe we could talk about it over coffee or something like that.
look, I just...
I can't, Anna.
you seemed great. I just- I don't know.
I should probably go.
take care, though. Bye.
Hey. - Hey.
I'm psyched you called. - Cool.
kind of given up on you when you didn't call me back.
I was just thinking about you.
want a glass of wine? - Sure.
okay, what were the categories again?
four categories:
smart, sexy, funny and cute.
but you can only be two things.
like Sarah Jessica Parker would be funny and sexy.
bill Clinton would be smart and sexy.
I can't believe you're hot for Clinton.
go. What am I?
wait, what was I again?
you're smart and cute.
okay, you are sexy, very sexy.
and cute.
no, you can't
sexy and cute are both in the looks column.
nobody wants to be all in one column.
I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four, which obviously you are.
especially sexy.
you're the best.
I better go.
okay, well, you know you could stay here if you want.
what? It's been a while.
no, I can't.
I can't stay, I'm totally
I'm totally, totally fried.
is that okay?
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Bye.
Hey.
that look straight to you?
why are you hanging that?
because you asked me to about three weeks ago.
I'm getting around to it.
Why? You don't want it here?
no, I love it there. But just stop.
Why? Is it the painting?
you know, I know, it looks kind of like a deflated boob here.
right? I know.
it's gonna be depressing. Should I take it down?
no, I want you to stop doing anything nice.
this feels like a trick.
no. - No?
no, I just- I just need you to stop being nice to me...
...unless you're gonna marry me after.
is that funny?
do you think that's funny?
no, I guess it's not funny.
see, you can't keep being nice to me...
...and I can't keep pretending that this is something that it's not.
we've been together for over seven years.
you know me, you know who I am.
you either wanna marry me or you don't.
or there's the possibility...
...that I mean it when I say I don't believe in marriage
bullshit.
bullshit.
come on, it's bullshit for every woman...
...that has been told by some man that he doesn't believe in marriage...
...and then six months later he's married to some 24-year-old that he met at a gym.
it's just- It's bullshit.
where is this coming from?
from the place I've been hiding from you for about five years.
okay.
five years, because I haven't wanted to seem demanding.
and I haven't wanted to seem clingy or psycho.
or whatever.
so I haven't asked you.
but I...
I have to.
I mean...
...are you ever gonna marry me?
Oh, I can't do this anymore.
I used to think that I had never been dumped.
Yeah, then we started comparing notes.
then we realized we've both been dumped by every man we've ever been with.
every one. - Yeah.
but they do it so skillfully. - Mm-hm.
they just so sneaky that you think it was your idea.
Yeah. You're sitting back and you're like:
Oh, yeah. This my idea. But wait a second, why am I alone?
why am I unhappy? Why have I gained 20 pounds?
they Jedi mind-trick you. - Yes, they do.
so they do a soft pass. - Yeah.
they got little lines they like to tell you.
like, "I don't wanna stand in your way.
or, "You're perfect, it's just I have to work on myself.
right. "I'm just thinking of your happiness.
Oh, I don't deserve you. " That's my favorite one.
you know the other one I like?
I am so jealous of the guy who gets to marry you.
well, that could have been you. - Yeah.
that's what I was leaning towards.
Yeah. And the second you hear that...
...run to the store, get yourself some ribs and some ice cream...
...because you have been dumped.
hey Anna, it's Ben.
listen, I know it's been a while since you called.
it's just- It took me by surprise.
but I did offer to help you with your career...
...and I don't see why I can't do that, right?
so why don't you give me a call...
...and maybe you can come by the office or something.
okay? All right, take care. Bye.
Hey, you.
Oh, shit.
what? - You scared me.
you okay? - Yeah.
everything's fine.
are you smoking again?
no, sweetie, I'm not smoking.
Why?
you get jumpy when you smoke.
I'm not smoking, I promise.
no, I was just sitting here...
...trying to picture what this room's gonna look like when it's finished.
I like that game. - You do?
Yeah.
what color did you picture?
that's where I got stuck.
Yeah.
I was thinking...
...maybe yellow.
yellow? Okay. - Yeah. I mean, it's neutral.
Mm-hm. - Yeah. So it could be whatever.
it could be an office, it could be a guest room...
...a gym, a baby's room...
wait, did you mean "neutral," or "gender-neutral"?
I don't know what you're talking about. - Oh, really?
I know we said we'd wait to talk about it.
but I think that we're almost ready to start talking about it.
so that's the last time I do anything pro bono.
well, ladies, I guess I have to get back to the office.
you go back to the office after happy hour? What's happy about that?
I met you.
I would love to call you sometime. Do you have a card?
of course. - Oh, great.
here is my info.
nice to meet you, Janine. - Nice to meet you.
look forward to hearing from you, Gigi.
Oh, wait.
so...
...how are we doing this?
are you hearing from me or am I getting a call?
what?
you said you'd love to call me...
...but then you said, "Look forward to hearing from you," and
you see how that's kind of confusing?
Yeah, look, we'll talk. We'll get in touch.
you did it again. Very vague.
you know what? Let's just say that you'll call me...
...and then we can skip all the nonsense.
goodbye, Gigi.
he was cute. - Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him.
what are you doing?
I'm not calling him.
if he wants to see me, he'll call.
that guy Alex really made an impression on you.
was he hot?
no. He was just...
...right.
morning.
morning, Ryan.
a surprise mocha venti just because you're so awesome.
love you. - Love you.
good morning.
okay.
so?
Oh, hi.
he asked me out. Oh, my God. He called?
well... - He e-mailed?
no. What?
left his calling card with your lady-in-waiting?
he MySpaced me. - Ouch.
Oh. - Oh, girl, I don't know about that.
my trampy little sister says MySpace is the new booty call.
well, what am I supposed to do?
I mean, things have changed.
people don't meet each other organically anymore.
if I would like to make myself seem more attractive to the opposite sex...
...I don't go and get a new haircut, I update my profile.
that's just the way it is, you know?
Yeah, she's right.
back, back, back, back.
ad sales, this is Mary.
Hi, Mary, this is Conor, Anna's friend, or whatever.
Hi.
so, what'd you think?
looking at it right now. I'm not sure about this.
Oh, you have to trust me.
it's a burgeoning market, you're gonna make a fortune.
I know. Did you have to put me with the massage ads?
well, it was either that or the page with the personals, so...
this page gets a lot of action.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?
Yeah.
okay.
all right, Mary, I'll talk to you soon. Thank you.
Bye.
what I'm trying to show you is that there's a difference.
there is a difference.
Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda to sew these dresses in two weeks?
she wanted to do it.
Really? She told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.
is that not right? No, she didn't.
no?
what's the-? Why the big rush to get married?
because I am not having my wedding during a gross Baltimore winter...
...and I am not waiting till spring.
you are so pregnant.
Oh, God, I'm not pregnant.
I'm not pregnant. That's ridiculous.
chug a beer then. No, I'm not chugging a beer.
chug a beer.
we're in love, you assholes.
that's what people do when they're in love, they get married.
but you know what? Not everybody gets married, you know?
there are many people who never get married.
well, thanks for the inspirational pep talk.
what she meant to say was that it's fine that you broke up with Neil.
right.
tons of people make the choice to be alone. They're happy.
look at Al Pacino.
never been married, happy as a clam.
would that-? Am I-? Would I be Al Pacino in this scenario?
no, Bethie, we just- We want you to be happy.
well, then you should have rethought the coral.
Oh, her face.
your face. - Don't make her cry.
I'm sick of these coral jokes.
I know, you're sensitive. Trust me, I get it.
Hey, why don't you have dinner with me and Steven and the kids...
...then you can just stay over-?
why'd she wanna hang out with you and your husband?
the last thing I'd feel like doing.
if being in this wedding is too painful
Oh, God, you guys. Please, stop it. Relax, relax.
that's enough, okay? Seriously, you guys, I'm
I've gone through breakups before. If you remember, I handle them quite well.
you've been there, you've seen it. I'm perfectly capable of doing this.
I can do it again.
I want you to stop worrying about me.
I'm fine.
I know it's here somewhere.
I spoke with George Lane in Music. He had a whole list of references for you.
well, that's okay. You can just call me when you find it.
I swear I didn't lure you here under false pretenses.
I know.
a girl can dream, though.
you're just too good a guy.
why are you married again?
seriously, why?
no, I really think that it would be good for me to know...
...why you cannot live without this other woman.
well, we'd been together since college and she gave me an ultimatum.
she said, "Either we get married or we break up.
so we got married.
Wow. You caved.
it's complicated.
Really?
what? You're a dick if you date a girl for too long and don't marry her.
you marry her and you're an asshole for marrying before you're ready.
I mean, shit, I don't know.
you're really hot.
and I am obviously attracted to you.
so I think the best I can do is...
...eventually find this piece of paper and call you...
...and hope to just help you out in your career in some small way.
Hi.
Hi. What's going on?
Javier, I thought we talked about tarping the furniture.
city Supper.
Hi, this is Gigi. Is Alex there?
hold on.
Alex? - Yo.
drinks are good? Yeah, one more.
Hello? - Hi, this is Gigi.
huh? - I, um...
...had the dentist pen.
right. Hey. How you doing?
I'm really sorry to bug you. - That's okay.
you had some really good insights and I wanted to ask you a question.
okay, look, now I need to be harsh with you.
Conor's never gonna be interested in you, Geege.
no, I know. This is about Jarrad.
so we meet at happy hour and he's completely charming
Hey, give me two seconds, okay? Two seconds, hold on.
let me guess. He said:
the only thing happy about this hour is you.
he might have used some derivative of that.
so he says he's going to call, but then he gives me his card and he says
Oh, he's not interested.
you don't even know if he's called. - Oh, did he?
no.
but I honestly think he's expect- - Okay.
Gigi, he is not interested.
Alex, this is jacked.
the hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a black shirt.
it's not black. - Look at it.
not a black shirt. I see it. It's not black.
this shit is black.
if a guy gives you his phone number instead of taking yours, he's not interested.
he took mine first. Then he gave
and also, if a guy wants to see you, believe me, he will see you.
I once called 55 Lauren Bells until I got the right one.
that's cute.
what happened?
Oh, yeah, as it turns out, her ass looked really huge in the daylight.
is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women?
don't call him. He doesn't like you.
don't tiptoe around my feelings.
well, I'm just trying to help. - I know. Thank you.
sure.
I gotta get back to work, but good luck.
okay, bye.
Hey, buddy, you home?
Yeah. Come on in.
Hey, you want a beer?
or an apple martini?
Oh, that's funny.
have you told your parents?
it's for work. I'm trying to expand my client base.
by pretending to be gay?
no, by being more gay-friendly.
or, in real estate terms, "gay-adjacent.
nice. I'm gonna use that.
I should change this. It's maybe a little much.
I don't know. Dressing like that, seeing a girl who won't sleep with you...
...I think you can pull it off.
it's not that she won't sleep with me, douche bag.
I have slept with her. It's just she, you know...
won't sleep with you anymore.
pretty much, yeah.
what do you think?
I think you got a problem...
...because you're gonna have to beat them away with a stick, you gorgeous, sexy man.
holy shit.
observe your breath.
inhale, belly rise.
and exhale, belly fall.
bring your hands together in front of your chest.
bow your head in gratitude.
Namaste. - Namaste.
thank you for coming. See you next week.
great class.
we ran into each other.
you came to my class.
I had no idea this was your class.
you called to ask me if this was my class.
no, you never called back.
because you told me not to call you if it was my class. It was.
no. We just ran into each other. - Okay.
we're just two innocent folks who happen to be working out near each other.
exactly.
do you want a swim?
sure.
you know, I was just thinking...
...why can't we be friends?
I mean, am I not allowed to have friends anymore?
I mean, am I not allowed to be friends with people that are hot?
I mean, what kind of reverse prejudice is that?
I hear you.
I mean...
...am I not supposed to be friends with a guy just because he's married?
right.
or has an insane smile?
or an ass that makes me wanna dry hump?
did you just say "dry hump"? - Yeah.
think I just fell in love.
so we're friends.
Yeah.
you wanna come in?
I'm sorry, I don't trust myself.
that's okay. You can just watch.
you know, you may be the best friend I've ever had.
Hi. - Hey.
take a shower. Hey. - What? Hi.
honey? - Yeah.
you smell weird.
I smell weird? - Yeah, different.
different how? - I don't know.
sort of an odd thing to say.
you know, maybe it was the ashtray and cigarettes I found.
in the back yard.
what part of "My dad died of lung cancer..."
...is so hard for you to wrap your brain around?
what?
do not lie to me, Ben. Please, okay?
are you serious?
we have, like, 8000 undocumented workers here daily.
okay, and you find an ashtray with cigarettes in it and you think
you automatically assume that they're mine.
Oh, yeah.
honey, I'm not lying to you.
I think...
...you are really freaking out.
this whole renovation thing's getting to you because nothing's happening.
just say no.
get it out.
gonna take a shower.
I'm exhausted. - Okay.
sorry. - It's all right.
who'd have thought that a random girl from yoga...
...would fix me up with such a good kisser? - Back at you, sister.
I can't wait to kiss you again.
but we're kissing right now.
I know, next time.
the second-date kiss is way more intimate.
well, listen...
...I'm leaving tomorrow, so I'll be out of touch for a little bit.
can you excuse me a quick second? Too many Diet Cokes.
okay.
Oh, yeah.
yeah?
Hey, sorry to bug you again. Quick question.
excuse me one minute, babe. Sorry.
what's going on?
okay, I'm making out with this guy- PG stuff.
and he mentions that he's going out of town, he's gonna be out of touch.
run.
but maybe he is going out of town.
where? Where's he going that he's gonna be out of touch?
where are you going out of town to again?
um- Uh- Pittsburgh.
pittsburgh.
run.
so, what, now I'm just supposed to run from every guy who doesn't like me?
Yeah.
there's not gonna be anybody left.
I don't know why I'm saying this...
...but I think I know a nice guy who might actually like you.
yeah? - Yeah.
he's friends with my brother. His name's Bill.
we'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.
so, I mean, I'm in his bathroom right now.
what do I do?
well, you gotta come out eventually, right? But I'd take my time in there.
I'd let him sweat.
Thanks. - Good luck.
Yeah, the boat looks great.
you look like shit.
but your boat looks great.
Yeah. I live on my boat, man.
personal hygiene goes out the window.
a lot of time to work on the place.
you should try working on a shower.
Yeah.
Hey, what can I tell you?
standing on principle, man. It's all I got.
cigarette?
no, I'm good.
that's right, you quit.
good for you.
so did Janine send you out here to check up on me?
Yeah, pretty much.
what are you gonna tell her?
I'll tell her how gorgeous you look out here on the ocean.
break.
any word from Beth?
she's so busy organizing her sister's funeral, I think she must be
sister's what?
her wedding. Her sister's wedding.
isn't that what I said? - No. You said "funeral.
no, I didn't. - Yes, you did.
shit, did I really?
that's so weird.
I don't understand why people wanna get married.
they don't.
they don't? - No.
no, no guy actually wants to get married.
and if they do, all they're really thinking about?
all the women they're gonna miss out on.
I don't wanna be with anybody else, just Beth.
I don't know, man, I...
why'd you get married?
I love Janine.
you're a happily married guy.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd say so.
now, I know I don't need to tell any of you...
...that my cousin Paige is hot.
in high school, if I told the popular guys that Paige was my cousin...
...it'd keep me from getting my ass kicked...
...because no one wanted to blow their chances with her.
and when she gets up there and says those marriage vows to Devon...
...there will be hearts breaking all over the world.
hear, hear. That's sweet.
but, you know, keep in mind that her sister Beth is still on the market.
Yeah, sure, she may be an older model...
...but she got a lot of good miles left in that tank.
but don't stay on the lot too long...
...or next year's models are gonna slip in there and steal all
okay, that's enough of the speeches.
okay.
so enjoy the crab.
and that yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it's the crab's hepatopancreas.
your cousin Jay has always been a jackass.
I know.
and somehow even he's married.
Oh, honey, look.
back when everyone was just going to camp at the Y...
...you borrowed my New York Times...
...found some arts camp in the Berkshires...
...wrote away for information and got accepted on your own.
you never did things like everyone else.
why not?
because that's you.
that's why you're my favorite daughter.
you're not supposed to say that.
I don't give a shit.
I'm retired, I'll say what I want to.
I'll say it to the whole room if you want.
wait, wait, wait! Come here. Stop.
it's true, though.
Hey.
what are you doing? - Waiting for you.
come on.
sorry I'm late.
no, it's okay.
I like a little time before a blind date.
prepare myself mentally, remind myself not to tell the story about my molars...
Gigi, he's not coming.
but you can tell me the story about the molars. I'd love to hear it.
Hey.
how could he already not like me?
I screwed up. I told Bill it was Thursday, not Tuesday. It's my fault.
Hi. Are you good?
can I get a Jameson on the rocks? - Sure.
awesome. I'm stuck with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.
meanwhile, this girl, she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak.
this one right here? - Mm-hm.
Oh, God, no.
how do you know?
the guy working the Tom Cruise thing?
she's interested, he's clearly not.
you cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not into her.
actually, I can. I see this stuff going on every night.
watch this. She's going on about her macrobiotic diet.
he's thinking, "Dear Christ, get me out of here.
and look, how fortuitous.
drinks spill, which is perfect for him, because now...
he can move on to the girl with the shoulder tattoo.
man, you have a gift.
now check out Droopy Dog on the other side.
he's gonna buy her drinks all night and she's still gonna insist there's no spark.
maybe there's not. You need a spark.
Oh, the spark thing is bullshit.
Really? - Bullshit.
enlighten me.
guys invented the spark...
...so they could not call and treat you kind of badly and keep you guessing...
...then convince you that that anxiety and fear that just develops naturally...
...was actually just a spark.
and you guys all buy it. You eat it up and you love it.
you love it because you feed off that drama. You all love that drama.
I don't.
so you never wait until the last minute on a deadline or a phone bill...because secretly you love the drama...
...of not knowing whether or not you're gonna make it?
maybe.
and let me guess:
when you were stalking Conor the other night...
...were you obsessing about him calling...
...constantly pacing back and forth, staring at your phone for days...
...even though the date was just kind of mediocre?
okay. Yeah.
because you all thrive on the drama. Thank you.
look, you gotta be more like me. If a girl likes me, great.
but if not, there are plenty more out there like her, you know?
that's like the chorus of the song.
now, you're gonna be singing what's on Djay's pad. Djay.
all right, now.

Djay, we need to talk, man.
look, I just want it to be perfect. And this mike, it ain't shit.
what the fuck wrong with it? That shit record, don't it?
Djay, the mikes we using, they got a wider pattern, D. They go flat.
so when you start screaming, man, they just distort and pop out.
man, nigga, I don't know shit about none of that shit!
all I know is that shit in there was live, man!
and every time I get my motherfucking mode up, - you come and fuck with it! - It ain't me.
that shit, it ain't gonna be live like that again.
I don't give a fuck what mike I'm on!
Djay, that shit was live in there, but it was also distorted, man.
God!
I just don't understand why I gotta pay so much more money for that microphone right there when the one right next to it look just like it but cost half, man.
let's do it this way, man.
if I buy two of them, say you give them to me both for $90.
this is studio quality. It costs $250.
now, why would I sell you two of them for $90 apiece?
just because of that statement, man, "The customer's always right," ain't you heard?
not in this case, sir, no.
if you want quality, you have to pay for it.
look, man, can't you cut me some type of break on this stuff here?
what was that?
what? - I mean, what you looking at, man?
nothing. - Don't worry, Sparky, man.
I ain't gonna pop or nothing like that.
look here, man.
the thing is, that gal over there, right?
I got it in real good with her.
I mean, she's my gal and all, but she doesn't necessarily belong to me.
you see, a gal like that, man, she the type of girl that wanna shut them doors, lock them, see what type of specials you got going on in the back.
and me, I'm the kind of man that just walk out of here and leave a girl like that behind because, like I say, she with me and all, but she don't belong to me.
not necessarily.
and maybe when she leaves...
...she can take something that doesn't necessarily belong to her neither.
it's like you say, man, you want quality, you got to pay for that.
Hey, gal.
I need that microphone.
okay.
I need you to go back there and be friendly with him and bring that microphone out with you, okay?
no. No way.
Nola, I need that microphone.

you will be good, now.
Hey.
I
Hey.

I gotta have a say in what I do! - You was in there for a minute.
I gotta have a say in what I do! - Look, man, I was gonna give.
I'm not gonna suck dick every time you come up short!
you got something for me.
do you got something for me?! - Fuck you, D.
here, take it! You earned it! - What the fuck's wrong with you?
this is expensive motherfucking-- Hey, Nola, bring your ass.
I'm fucking out of here. I don't care. - Nola! Don't you do this shit right now!
Nola! Bring your ass here, man!

you can't see my penis, can you?
Hey, Superman! Hey, Superman!
well, hello there, young man, what's your name?
kenneth Giles. Can I shoot you?
Kenneth, why would you want to do something like that?
so the bullet bounces off. Can I?
well, if you did shoot me and the bullet bounced off, it might accidentally hit someone else.
we don't want that to happen, do we? No.
why don't you just, you and I... Here we go, partner.
why don't you just give me that? Just hand me that...
one minute...
you think I don't see what you're doing? I'm sorry?
day after day taking pictures.
I'm just waiting for the traffic.
he leaves those where I can see them.
and then he pretends he doesn't know what I'm talking about.
miss Sinclair... What is he paying you?
that's confidential.
he's been out of work for seven months.
I don't know what he does all day. He won't tell me.
now, why don't you investigate that?
ma'am, I'm just trying to turn a buck here, that's all.
if there's a problem between you two, maybe you should talk to a priest or whatever.
hash it out.
I can't fix your marriage, ma'am.
I don't know, I thought you might put in a word.
what do you suggest I say?
he drops a hint to Zinnemann.
that's how these things work, you know. It was a very solid audition.
it's Harry Cohn's picture. Eddie's at MGM.
well, what ever happened to honor among thieves?
let's just save it for something important.
Oh, I see. This isn't important at all. Wow.
here.
because you've had a rough week.
well, who needs another watch?
I just don't want some drunk finishing what that horrid child started.
I don't know that a gun is the answer.
it would just make me feel more comfortable knowing...
what would make me feel safe is not prancing around in a monkey suit in front of 8, 000 screaming...
you'd be gone, George, all right?
and then what happens to me?
Mrs. Mannix, please.
who shall I say is calling?
lawrence Farmer, from the St. Jude's Foundation.
to thank her for her generosity.
one moment, please.
howard: Mr. Simo.
do I know you?
no. But I'm familiar with you.
everybody reads the Times, huh?
I'm Howard Strickling. I handle publicity at MGM.
how do you do?
and I'm wondering why you would be trying to approach Mrs. Mannix under false pretenses.
are you speaking professionally?
I'm speaking as a friend of the Mannixes.
can I see Mrs. Mannix?
she's not well.
and frankly, neither she nor her husband appreciate being dragged into this business.
what business is that?
your business, Mr. Simo.
you didn't have to go and do that.
you seem to have an inflated sense of your importance.
they're on routine patrol.
could you pass along a message to Mrs. Mannix?
and what would that be?
hope to see her at the funeral.
art! Where's the boy? I've been hunting all over.
he's over there.
Zinnemann sure did keep us hanging long enough.
but I knew it would pan out.
how did you know that?
what choice did I have?
and, Toni, thank you.
for what?
whatever you did to help. You know how much he needed this.
woman: Hi, George.
hello. Hi.
Mr. Weissman? I don't want to disturb you, but I...
you knew George? No.
I'm Louis Simo. I'm a...
I'm no speechmaker.
saying what you really feel, it's hard.
thank you for coming.
Mr. Weissman, I was just wondering if you...
seeing me off the grounds again?
Mrs. Mannix was unable to attend. For reasons I'm sure you can understand.
you do a lot for your friends.
and you're just doing your job.
but I am concerned.
yeah? About what?
your history.
people are rarely afforded the chance to make the same mistake twice.
are you threatening me?
I'm offering you an opportunity.
there's a place for you at Metro if you'd like. The pay can be generous.
I'd rather talk to Mrs. Mannix.
there's nothing there for you.
yeah? Then why are you pitching me?
when it comes to publicity, what's true or false really doesn't matter.
if it hurts the studio, if it stops one person from buying a ticket,
I have to fix it. That's my job.
the offer's sincere.
don't let pride stand in the way. It won't get you what you want.
sad day, huh, boys? Tell you what's sadder.
calling it suicide when it's really murder. Now why would the cops do that?
sing us a new song, Simo.
what, you don't love me any more?
two months ago, somebody drained all the fluid out of George Reeves' brake line.
almost bought it right then. Coincidence, right?
I mean, LAPD don't make mistakes. Huh, Patterson? What's the truth, huh, boys?
who wanted him dead?
you guys might be lazy, but nobody said you're dumb.
give me that. Name some names.
you want me to write it for you, too?
Hey, you got a story or not?
you want names? Ask this guy.
he's got the names. The names, pictures.
what's he doing here when MGM never cut Reeves a check in his life?
huh? Come on, do some work, will you?
Hey, Capa, lift the fucking camera, will you.
there you go. Say cheese.
excuse me. Excuse me.
Hi, Bobby.
Hi, Bobby. Good to see you.
thank you so much.
good luck. How you doing, kid? Good to see you.
well, buddy, they love it so far.
man ON SCREEN: You got any prejudices against girls?
that's what I thought.
well, now, it looks like you're all primed for a big night, Tom.
Hello, Stark. Want some company?
no, thanks, all tied up.
leva tells me you've been eyeing the Captain's wife like a hound dog at hunting time. He has, huh?
crowd: Superman.
stark: Well, I wouldn't put stock in stories like that.
Tom: This ain't no story.
man: Look up on the screen!
stark: Not for long, though.
man: More powerful than a locomotive!
people can see you.
man 2: Faster than a speeding bullet.
man 3: Hey, where's Lois Lane?
man ON SCREEN: Hello.
woman ON SCREEN: I didn't think you were coming.
man ON SCREEN: Why not? I ain't late.
I'll always take care of my boy.
nice shot, Louie.
kit?
you listening?
get the fuck out of my house!
are you listening? Nod your head.
be smart. Let it go.
what, your mother's snatch? She won't let me.
here's what I mean.
kit: Louis? Louis?
Louis, can you hear me? Louis?
I'm calling a doctor, all right?
I don't wanna go to the doctor.
well, at least some ice.
there's no ice in the fridge.
stop being stubborn, all right? You were unconscious.
there's no ice. What did you say?
there's no ice.
sit down.
what's this about?
this murder bullshit I've been slinging.
I think it might be true.
I can help. Oh, come on, you know I can.
kit, let's call it a day, all right?
what? You shouldn't be around me.
this isn't some TV show you wanna be in.
this is just a fucked-up little business.
it makes you go around, and you find out how shitty people are to make the rent.
you don't really believe that. I know you care about what you do.
you know what I care about?
that you're balling this Chad kid and you don't got the guts to tell me.
look, I was...
going to. Yeah. So, now you don't have to.
do you want me here today?
no, I don't think I do.
let's go outside.
you packing? Not when I cross the street for lunch.
Lou, I do what I'm told.
you took the cash from that rag, same as me!
$4, 500 for ratting on some hop-head actress and I never said a word!
cause I'm loyal! To my fucking partner!
Rick. Why?
didn't say. Just, Take care of it.
you tell me why!
look, when I helped you out with the old lady,
I should've kept my mouth shut. I had to make good.
you would have done the same thing, don't bullshit me!
that's how the mortgage gets paid!
what?
Mr. Simo.
Mr. Sinclair?
you have to stop, okay, I'm not gonna... I need your help.
things are...
they're not what they seem.
what are you saying?
I've misjudged terribly.
can you meet with me, Mr. Simo? I won't bother you again.
please.
meet you where?
what are you doing here?
I... My client...
she was your client?
shot her in the throat, the heart and in the vagina.
sinclair: Mr. Simo.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
I do wish you'd been prompt. I suppose the fault is mine for failing to see that you and your whore were not aiding me, but guarding the rampant fornications of my wife.
I hope you've learned the meaning of justice.
come on.
this one's easier than your other murder.
so, what's the emergency?
better have a drink, Art.
it's 10: 30 in the morning. What?
it's pretty bad.
what is?
enough, George. Let's deal with it.
we're canceled.
I just don't see the point.
the point is it's my production company.
if I don't sell myself, who will?
the business is here, George.
Yes, but the money's in New York.
I can get in the papers there.
it's a lot of bother.
I want to do this. I'm looking forward to it. I'll take charge of my own life.
I see.
no, you don't.
you think I should just sit around here, doing God knows what, while the both of us... Yes?
while the both of us what?
my love, this makes sense to me.
I can set up my own projects. Direct and produce and...
we'll get some other sap to jump around in colored underwear.
who knows, maybe I'll direct a picture for MGM.
I'll be back in two weeks.
kiss me.
let me close this. You have to kiss me.
I have to go. Toni...
George, kiss me.
all right.
shit.
LEONORE: That bitch who hired you, you think she loved Georgie?
who is this?
he grew up without a father.
when he's old enough, she finally tells him what happened to Daddy.
miss Lemmon? Suicide.
pistol in the mouth. Georgie never stopped thinking about it.
fifteen years later, he gets a visitor. His father, alive.
all he'd done was dump the bitch for another woman.
left Georgie, too.
so Mommy tells baby, Daddy killed himself.
she tells her own son.
Georgie swore he'd never speak to her again.
this lets you off the hook?
I didn't screw his head on backwards, she did.
LOUIS: Why are you telling me now?
I'm...
I'm just a little blotto, sugar.
kind of horny.
and pretty goddamn all alone.
so...
I don't know.
and I thought maybe we had something in common.
Mrs. Bessolo?
Mrs. Bessolo.
Mrs. Bessolo!
I won't be needing your services any longer, Mr. Simo.
and when were you going to tell me?
I intend to mail you a check.
a check?
that's it?
I don't owe you anything else.
how about an explanation?
how about telling me your son wouldn't give you the time of day?
don't you use that tone with me!
Mr. Strickling gave me his word. Strickling?
a statue would be erected...
a what? ...in my son's honor, outside the Chinese Theater.
you never gave a shit, did you?
you'll be paid.
keep your goddamn check.
my son was a great star.
he deserves a statue.
can I take your picture? Sure.
Oh, wait. I blinked, take another one.
sorry, no retakes.
my goddamn eyes were closed.
you know who that is over there? Can I take your picture?
Superman.
right. He's got to be loaded.
you know, my little cousins are glued to that show.
look at her ass.
Len, look.
what's really exciting to me...
Earl Wilson.
look at you all dressed up. I haven't seen you since...
you punched a waiter in Sardi's and broke his nose.
I left a nice tip.
find something funny, junior?
no, no, no.
I know when I'm out of my league.
don't sell yourself short.
I got a big heart.
I'll bet you've got a big one, too.
that's very nice of you to say, Miss...
leonore Lemmon.
miss Lemmon.
so, how about an autograph for my poor crippled nephew?
is he in an iron lung?
he's in Yonkers.
Superman wants to get laid.
Goddamn!
make room for fucking Daddy!
you know what, stallion? What?
I think you're starting to get the hang of this.
let's do it again.
Hey, Scout.
mom's picking me up.
I know that. I just wanted to...
I got you something.
I left it in the car.
I'll give it to you when we go home. Come on. Let's go.
how come you're not at work?
cause I don't sit in an office, okay? That's for suckers.
your pop's an investigator, all right?
come on, let's go.
I'm supposed to wait for Mom.
what? I'm supposed to wait for Mom.
your mom and me, we don't...
Evan.
Evan.
nobody has magic powers.
you got to be tough.
you got to show them what you're made of, you know?
my father never taught me that.
okay, here we go. Come on.
come on.
I'm his son. He's my son, he is.
tell him, Scout. Just tell him.
Evan, tell him, please. Come on.
Evan. Evan.
honey, what's the matter?
Oh, Jesus.
could you take him... Just take him... Sure.
whatever you want to say, you know.
are you going to fight everybody?
I thought you liked tough guys.
you're saying this why?
I want to be honest with you.
my, that's noble.
what is that, from some script you auditioned for in the '40s?
no. It's just me talking to you.
I'm so grateful.
straight arrow George!
you go to New York, and you fuck some whore, and you run back to tell me!
she's not a whore.
she's an actress. A singer?
does she blow smoke rings with her cunt?
is it a fling you want?
it's not a fling.
Oh, you're in love!
two weeks in a hotel room?
she makes me feel young.
have you seen yourself, George?
your face is going. Don't do this.
here, your eyes, your hair, your stomach. Stop it.
you think no one notices? Toni, don't do this.
but you've got your projects, haven't you? You're going to be a director.
you'll sit in your little canvas chair, polishing your balls.
thank God I'm rid of that hag I had to screw.
what was her name? The one who paid for everything!
the one who bought me a fucking house! For God's sake!
you want publicity? You'll get it. I'll say you're a Red.
and a faggot. A lush. Nobody can call that a lie.
you know what? You've never helped me. You never helped me!
you could've talked to Eddie.
you could've gotten me something, but you didn't!
because you liked me where I was, in a fucking red suit!
you liked that! Well, that's not who I am, you understand?
God damn you!
but, George, that's all you were good for.
ten-year-olds and shut-ins.
that was the best you were ever going to be.
I knew that. Why didn't you?
they rushed it and closed the case. I didn't like it from the start.
Why?
there was pressure.
Oh, yeah? From who?
look, I can't do what you can do. Understand?
I got a wife, kids, car payments.
look, I'm in for 20 and a pension.
but I got nothing to lose, huh?
think it through. MGM buys off the mother.
I'm not getting paid, pal.
that's all, it's about for you. Hey.
I got that woman killed. For nothing, okay?
fifty bucks a day, I'm stringing her husband along like I'm running him 'cause I can't see straight in front of me.
no. I'm done.
look, this is how they work and it just gets buried.
don't you want to know about this guy?
why don't you get on the right side of something for once?
where do you come off telling me what I should do?
well, I'm not the one with the guilty conscience, am I?
who wants me to wrestle?
professional circuit. They're serious.
you might get a kick out of it.
what do you got, a party?
no. Just a few friends of Leonore's making a racket.
so now when that old bitch calls, this gizmo records it automatically.
so at least the cops believe us.
I got a delivery for Mr. Reeves.
Hey, in there! Excuse me.
sorry.
put that on the table.
Georgie, why don't you show this boy how much we love him?
all right.
why don't we take it easy on this batch, Len?
all right, kid, here's 100. Go make your first million.
Georgie, you are directing your own movie in a month.
live a little, okay? Or take a headache pill.
just don't ruin the party, okay? All right.
give me a kiss. Go. Go on.
George: All right, all right.
LEONORE: I'll fix you a drink, all right?
yeah?
EDDIE: That actor...
Eddie, it's very late.
what's he planning to do with the rest of his life?
he has some spaceman script set up with Wasserman.
to direct.
if you offered some kind of...
Yeah, yeah. I know how to handle it.
well, all right.
very nice.
thank you. You're very kind.
what did you think, my sweetest dream? Moved to tears?
I thought you sounded like a goddamn beaner.
well, and so good night.
Hey!
universal is not the only studio. Get him in the door someplace else.
I already tried. Try harder.
he's your only client. What kind of bullshit agent are you?
Leonore. You come around here, dragging around like a wet goddamn dog! Leonore, stop it!
art, we talked about this.
this picture's important. Or it was.
these people don't want me. They don't know what I can do.
and we got to show it to them, show them I can do something different.
we got to cook something up for me now.
the wrestling offer.
does it pay?
their only concern, are you up to it physically?
well, we'll...
you can film me, so they can see.
why don't you just join the goddamn circus?
how are you doing?
Mrs. Mannix?
MAID: I'll just put it on the bed.
Mrs. Mannix?
Mrs. Mannix, can I talk to you?
it's about George.
george shot himself.
he was shot.
someone shot him, is that what you mean?
who did that?
Mrs. Mannix. Can you help me，understand?
will you please help me?
did you know George?
why don't you tell me about him?
he really was the most beautiful boy.
Mrs. Mannix, please, if I could just come in.
you're not invited, Simo.
were you? We're working.
come on.
why don't you lay off?
Mr. Harris. Hello, Louis.
you come up from Palos Verdes just to see me?
I came to celebrate my friends' anniversary.
you've met Mr. Mannix.
no, but we got people in common.
ain't that right, Eddie?
I've got nothing in common with you.
Bernice, the first missus.
you like that car crash gimmick, huh?
Rick... Riva Watson.
she gets all clingy?
how'd it feel pounding her face in?
happy times, huh, Ed?
Richard, please.
george Reeves... That's enough, Louis.
am I being indiscreet? Bad for business, huh?
Louis, your problems are your own.
Ricky, you cover for this prick?
whatever you're pursuing here. Whatever fantasy...
you had a bullet put in Reeves' head!
...you constructed will not alter your past.
he used the studio and the cops...
you're going to burn in hell, you son of a bitch!
come here.
you don't know me.
you don't know what I think. What I do.
I don't let you.
you're an old man, Eddie.
who's going to wipe the blood off your hands?
my hands?
I'm in the picture business.
no, you're a murderer.
prove it.
you hear me? Go on, I'm ready.
prove one fucking thing.
Oh, God.
people are waiting. You coming down?
help with the dress. Yeah.
okay?
I'm gonna let some light in.
I want to tell you something.
you know I'll always take care of you.
whatever's happened...
whatever might have been done. It doesn't matter.
nobody's going to hurt you.
nobody gets to ask. I won't allow it.
you're safe with me. With your husband.
let me see what you look like.
you're beautiful.
you always will be.
I see the pieces.
how they should fit.
how I want them to fit.
but I can't.
I looked in his face.
I know he could do it.
wouldn't think about it twice.
Eddie Mannix?
Yeah.
no, I would never say it wasn't possible.
what about Mrs. Mannix?
you had to like her. Such brightness.
could she have done what you're saying?
I don't want to think that.
and Leonore?
we never got along.
leave it there.
Mr. Reeves?
a charming man.
funny. Handsome.
not like the ones today. All the squinting and the mumbling.
a movie-star face.
why wasn't he one?
where he wound up, it should have been enough, right?
enough for a life.
but George...
yeah?
I never showed this. I knew it wouldn't help.
you watch it.
tell me what you see.
good night.
shortly thereafter, the instructions came through.
get the fuck out of London, youse dumb fucks.
get to Bruges.
I didn't even know where Bruges fucking was.
it's in Belgium.
RAY.; Bruges is a shithole.
KEN.; Bruges is not a shithole.
Bruges is a shithole.
ray, we've only just got off the fucking train.
could we reserve judgment on Bruges until we've seen the fucking place?
I know it's gonna be a shithole.
shithole.
I think you have a couple of rooms booked under Cranham and Blakely?
Yes. No, we have one room booked.
one twin room. Booked for two weeks.
two weeks!
do you have another room?
no, I'm afraid we're fully booked.
with Christmas, everywhere is fully booked.
okay.
it's very pretty.
I'm not being funny, we can't stay here.
we've got to stay here until he rings.
well, what if he doesn't ring for two weeks?
then we stay here for two weeks.
for two weeks? In fucking Bruges? In a room like this?
with you? No way!
ray, I really don't like to say this...
you really don't like to say what?
well... You know?
fucking bring that up.
do you think this is good?
do I think what's good?
you know, going round in a boat, looking at stuff.
Yes, I do.
it's called "sightseeing."
Oh, look at that.
it's a former hospital. From the 1100s.
Bruges is the most well-preserved medieval town in the whole of Belgium, apparently.
coming up? What's up there?
the view.
the view of what? The view of down here? I can see that from down here.
ray, you're about the worst tourist in the whole world.
Ken, I grew up in Dublin. I love Dublin.
if I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me.
but I didn't, so it doesn't.
trying to get rid of me coins.
will you take 4. 90?
entry is 5 euro.
come on, man, it's only 10 cents.
entry is 5 euro.
happy in your work?
very happy.
I like it here.
man: Been to the top of the tower?
Yeah. Yeah, it's rubbish.
it is? The guidebook says it's a "must-see."
well, you lot ain't going up there.
pardon me? Why?
I mean, it's all windy stairs. I'm not being funny.
what exactly are you trying to say?
what exactly am I trying to say?
youse are a bunch of fucking elephants!
right, you...
come on, leave it, fatty.
you know, you're just the rudest man. The rudest man!
what's all that about?
they're not going up there.
Hey, guys, I wouldn't go up there. It's really narrow.
screw you, motherfucker!
americans, isn't it?
now, this is more like it. Proper holidays.
one gay beer for my gay friend, and one normal beer for me, because I am normal.
this is the life.
we're not staying here getting pissed.
we are quietly sightseeing, like he says, and awaiting his call to see what we do next.
this is my vote on what we should do.
we give it another day, two days, max.
then we check the papers again, and if there's still nothing in them, we phone him and say, "Harry, thank you for the trip to Bruges," it's been very nice, all the old buildings and that, "but we're coming back to London now, and hide out in a proper country," where it isn't all just fucking chocolates.
my vote would be we quietly sightsee, like he says, and await his call to see what we do next.
you don't even know we're here hiding out.
what are you talking about?
you don't even know we're not here on a job.
what, on a job? Yeah.
here in Bruges? Yeah.
here in Bruges, on a job? Yeah.
Why? What did he actually say?
he didn't actually say anything.
then why do you think it might be? I don't think anything.
but it's a bit fucking over-elaborate, isn't it?
"go take him to hide out." "Go take him to hide out where?"
go take him to hide out in fucking Bruges.
you can hide out in Croydon.
hmm.
or Coventry.
hmm.
it is a bit over-elaborate.
hmm.
but we haven't got any guns.
Harry can get guns anywhere.
he's not gonna ring tonight.
he's not gonna ring tonight.
let's go out.
go out where? The pub.
No!
let's go out and have a look at some of the...
all the old medieval buildings and that.
because I bet they look even better at night, all lit up.
Yes!
that there is called the Gruuthuse Museum.
they all have funny names, don't they?
Yes, Flemish.
in here it says, "The Belgians twice sheltered fugitive English Kings "from being murdered, 1471 and 1651.
I used to hate history, didn't you?
it's all just a load of stuff that's already happened.
what are they doing over there?
they're filming something. They're filming midgets!
ray!
man: So, on this scene, you're supposed to walk like a little, tiny mouse, yeah?
okay? Great.
ray, come on, let's go.
my arse, "Let's go." They're filming midgets.
Oh, my God! Look at that girl.
she's gorgeous!
ray, we're going right now.
fuck off, are we!
this is the best bit of Bruges so far. You and your buildings.
hello.
do you speak English? No.
Yes, you do. Everybody does.
what are you filming midgets for?
it's a Dutch movie. It's a dream sequence.
it's a pastiche of Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now.
not a pastiche, but a...
a "homage" is too strong. A "nod of the head"?
wow, your English is very good.
a lot of midgets tend to kill themselves.
a disproportionate amount.
herve Villechaize, off of Fantasy Island.
I think somebody off The Time Bandits.
I suppose they must get really sad about, like, being really little and that.
people looking at them and laughing at them.
calling them names. You know, "shortarse."
there's another famous midget I'm missing, but I can't remember.
it's not the R2-D2 man. No, he's still going.
I hope your midget doesn't kill himself. Your dream sequence will be fucked.
he doesn't like being called a midget. He prefers "dwarf.
well, this is exactly my point!
people go around calling you a midget when you want to be called a dwarf.
of course you're gonna blow your head off!
my name's Ray. What's yours? Chloe.
how did you get past the security man?
getting past security men, it's sort of my job.
you're a shoplifter?
no, not a shoplifter.
it's a good joke, though.
no.
I'll tell you what I am at dinner tomorrow night.
fuck.
how fucking cool.
Mr. Blakely?
Yes. No, Mr. Cranham. No. Yes. Mr. Blakely. Yes.
you have a message.
shit!
Harry.; Number one, why aren't you in when I fucking told you to be in?
number two, why doesn't this hotel have phones with fucking voicemail and not I have to leave messages with the fucking receptionist?
number three, you better fucking be in tomorrow night when I fucking call again or there'll be fucking Hell to pay, I'm fucking telling you. Harry.
would you turn the fucking light off!
sorry, Ken.
keep the fucking noise down!
someone's in a mood.
you'll never guess what.
will you shut your fucking mouth, please, and go to sleep?
Oh, sorry.
except I've gotta take me contact lenses out.
altogether, I had five pints of beer and six bottles.
no. Six pints of beer and seven bottles.
and you know what? I'm not even pissed!
you'll never guess what, Ken.
Ken, you'll never guess what. What?
got a date for tomorrow night.
I'm very happy for you.
with a girl.
can you turn the light off, please?
only been in Bruges one day, got a date with a girl in the film business, the Belgian film business.
they're doing a film about a midget.
miss?
Marie?
sorry about the message last night. The man who left it is a bit of a...
well, he's a bit of a...
cock?
Yes. He's a bit of a cock.
morning.
Harry called last night.
we missed him.
jeez, he swears a lot, doesn't he?
we're staying in tonight. Whatever happens.
hmm.
except...
hmm. Hmm.
except "hmm" what?
except only one of us needs to stay in, really.
Uh-huh.
and which one of us would that be, now, Ray?
I thought you didn't like Bruges.
I don't like Bruges, it's a shithole.
but I did already say I had a date with a Belgian lady in the Belgian film business, which I did already say about before.
just don't get into any fucking trouble.
we're keeping a low profile.
and this morning, and this afternoon, we are doing what I want to do.
got it? Of course.
which, I presume, will involve culture.
Oh, we shall strike a balance between culture and fun.
somehow I believe, Ken, that the balance shall tip in the favor of culture.
like a big, fat, fucking retarded, fucking black girl on a seesaw, opposite a dwarf.
ray, did we or did we not agree that if I let you go on your date tonight, we'd do the things I wanted to do today?
we are doing the things that you wanted to do today.
and that we'd do them without you throwing a fucking moody, like some 5-year-old who's dropped all his sweets?
I didn't agree to that.
I'll cheer up. I'll cheer up.
up there, the top altar, is a phial brought back by a Flemish knight from the Crusades in the Holy Land.
and that phial, do you know what it's said to contain?
no, what's it said to contain?
it's said to contain some drops of Jesus Christ's blood.
Yeah, that's how this church got its name. Basilica of the Holy Blood.
Yeah. Yeah.
and this blood, right, though it's dried blood, at different times over many years, they say it turned back into liquid.
turned back into liquid from dried blood.
at various times of great stress.
yeah? Yeah.
so, yeah, I'm gonna go up in the queue and touch it, which is what you do.
yeah? Yeah. You coming?
do I have to?
do you have to? Of course you don't have to.
it's Jesus' fucking blood, isn't it? Of course you don't fucking have to!
of course you don't fucking have to!
you little fucking cunt.
RAY.; Murder, Father.
PRIEST.; Why did you murder someone, Raymond?
for money, Father.
for money?
you murdered someone for money?
Yes, Father.
not out of anger, not out of nothing. For money.
who did you murder for money, Raymond?
you, Father.
I'm sorry?
I said you, Father. What, are you deaf?
Harry Waters says hello.
the little boy.
Ray: I quite like this one.
all the rest were rubbish by spastics, but this one's quite good.
what's that all about, then?
it's Judgment Day, you know? Oh, yeah.
what's that then?
well, it's, you know, the final day on Earth.
when mankind will be judged for all the crimes they've committed and that.
and see who gets into Heaven and who gets into Hell and all that?
Yeah.
and what's the other place?
purgatory.
purgatory?
purgatory's kind of like the in-between one.
you weren't really shit, but you weren't all that great, either.
like Tottenham.
do you believe in all that stuff, Ken?
about Tottenham?
the Last Judgment and the afterlife.
guilt and sins and
hell and all that?
um...
well...
KEN: I don't know, Ray. I don't know what I believe.
the things you're taught as a child, they never really leave you, do they?
so, like, I believe in trying to lead a good life.
like, if there's an old lady, carrying her shopping home,
I don't try and help her carry her shopping, I don't go that far, but I'll certainly hold the door open for her and that, and let her go out before me.
Yeah. And anyway, if you tried to help her carry her shopping, she'd probably think you were just trying to nick her shopping.
exactly. This is the world we live in today.
at the same time as trying to lead a good life,
I have to reconcile myself with the fact that, yes, I have killed people.
not many people. Most of them were not very nice people.
apart from one person.
who's that?
this fellow, Danny Aliband's brother.
he was just trying to protect his brother. Like you or I would.
he was just a lollipop man.
he came at me with a bottle. What are you gonna do?
I shot him down.
hmm.
in my book, though, sorry, someone comes at you with a bottle, that is a deadly weapon, he's gotta take the consequences.
I know that in my heart.
I also know that he was just trying to protect his brother, you know?
I know. But a bottle, that can kill you.
it's a case of it's you or him.
if he'd come at you with his bare hands, that'd be different.
that wouldn't have been fair.
well, technically, your bare hands can kill somebody, too.
they can be deadly weapons, too. I mean, what if he knew karate, say?
you said he was a lollipop man.
he was a lollipop man.
what's a lollipop man doing knowing fucking karate?
I'm just saying.
how old was he? About 50.
what's a 50-year-old lollipop man doing knowing fucking karate?
what was he, a Chinese lollipop man?
Jesus, Ken, I'm trying to talk about...
I know what you're trying to talk about.
I killed a little boy. You keep bringing up fucking lollipop men!
you didn't mean to kill a little boy.
I know I didn't mean to.
but because of the choices I made and the course that I put into action, a little boy isn't here anymore.
and he'll never be here again.
I mean here in the world, not here in Belgium.
well, he'll never be here in Belgium, either, will he?
I mean, he might have wanted to come here when he got older.
I don't know why.
and that's all because of me.
he's dead because of me.
and I'm trying to...
I'm trying to get me head around it, but I can't.
I will always have killed that little boy.
that ain't ever going away. Ever.
unless...
maybe I go away.
don't even think like that.
you look good.
what's it matter anyway?
so, what do you do, Raymond?
I shoot people for money.
what kinds of people?
priests. Children. You know, the usual.
is there a lot of money to be made in that line of business?
there is in priests. There isn't in children.
so what is it you do, Chloe?
I sell cocaine and heroin to Belgian film crews.
do you?
do I look like I do?
you do, actually.
do I look like I shoot people?
no.
just children.
Mmm-hmm.
I saw your midget today. Little prick didn't even say hello.
well, he's on a lot of ketamine.
what's that?
horse tranquilizer.
a horse tranquilizer?
Where'd he get that? I sold it to him.
you can't sell horse tranquilizers to a midget!
this movie, I think it's gonna be a very good one.
there's never been a classic movie made in Bruges until now.
of course there hasn't, it's a shithole.
Bruges is my hometown, Ray.
well, it's still a shithole.
it's not a shithole.
what? Even midgets have to take drugs to stick it.
okay.
so, you've insulted my hometown.
you're doing very well, Raymond.
why don't you tell me some Belgian jokes while you're at it?
I don't know any Belgian jokes.
and if I did, I think I'd have the good sense not to...
Hey, hang on. Is Belgium where there were all those child abuse murders lately?
then I do know a Belgian joke.
what's Belgium famous for?
chocolates and child abuse.
and they only invented the chocolates to get to the kids.
what?
one of the girls they murdered was a friend of mine.
I'm sorry, Chloe.
one of the girls they murdered wasn't a friend of mine.
I just wanted to make you feel bad.
and it worked. Quite well.
fucking unbelievable.
what's fucking unbelievable?
are you talking to me?
he pauses, even though he should just hit the cunt.
and he repeats.
Yes, I am talking to you. What's fucking unbelievable?
well, I'll tell you what's fucking unbelievable, shall I?
blowing cigarette smoke straight into myself and my girlfriend's face.
that's fucking unbelievable!
this is the smoking section. I don't care if it's the smoking section.
all right? She directed it right in my face, man.
I don't wanna die just because of your fucking arrogance. Uh-huh.
isn't that what the Vietnamese used to say?
Vietnamese? What are you talking about, the Vietnamese?
that statement makes no fucking sense at all.
yes it does. The Vietnamese!
well, saying it over and over ain't gonna make any more sense out of it.
how does the Vietnamese have any relevance whatsoever to myself and my girlfriend having to breathe your friend's cigarette smoke?
tell me how saying...
that's for John Lennon, you Yankee fucking cunt!
a bottle? No, don't bother.
we're leaving.
I don't hit women! I would never hit a woman, Chloe!
I'd hit a woman who was trying to hit me with a bottle!
that's different. That's self-defense, isn't it?
or a woman who could do karate.
I'd never hit a woman generally, Chloe. Don't think that.
God, you're pretty.
I have to make a call.
Oh, no.
you've gone off me, now, haven't you? Just because I hit that fucking cow.
Hello? HARRY.; Where the fuck were you yesterday?
we just popped out for some dinner, Harry. We only popped out for half an hour.
yeah? What'd you have?
for dinner? Yeah.
pizza, at Pizza Hut.
was it nice?
Yeah, it was all right. I don't know. It was Pizza Hut.
the same as in England.
well, that's globalization, isn't it? Is Ray there with you?
he's in the toilet.
can he hear? No.
what's he doing?
what do you mean? Is he doing a wee or a poo?
I don't know, Harry, the door's closed.
send him out on an errand for half an hour, but don't make it sound suspicious.
ray? Why don't you go out down to the pub for half an hour?
Yeah, yeah, I know I said you couldn't, but might as well enjoy ourselves, eh?
no, I don't know if they've got bowling anywhere. Could have a look.
Yeah, see you.
Yeah. He's gone.
What'd you say to him?
I said, " Why don't you go have a drink, you say you've been cooped up?
what did he say? Said, yeah, he would.
and he might go have a look to see if there's a bowling alley around.
was he just having a wee?
Yeah, I think so. I assume so.
sure he didn't mind?
no, he was glad to get out.
he's definitely gone?
Yeah, yeah, he slammed the door.
that don't mean he's gone. Go check outside the door.
Harry, he's definitely gone.
you realize there are no bowling alleys in Bruges?
I realize that, Harry. The boy wanted to have a look anyway.
what are they gonna have, a medieval fucking bowling alley?
as I say, I think he was just glad to get out and about.
so, is he having a nice time, seeing all the canals and that?
I had a lovely time when I was there.
all the canals and the old buildings and that.
when were you here?
when I was seven. Last happy holiday I fucking had.
have you been on a canal trip, yet? Yeah.
have you been down, like, all the old cobbled streets and that?
Yeah.
it's like a fairytale, isn't it, that place? Yeah.
with the churches and that. They're Gothic. Yeah.
is it Gothic? Yeah.
so he's having a really nice time?
well, I'm having a really nice time.
I'm not sure if it's really his cup of tea.
what?
you know, I'm not sure if it's really his thing.
what do you mean, "It's not really his thing"?
what's that supposed to mean, "It's not really his thing"?
what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
nothing, Harry.
it's a fairytale fucking town, isn't it?
how can a fairytale town not be somebody's fucking thing?
how can all those canals and bridges and cobbled streets and those churches, all that beautiful fucking fairytale stuff, how can that not be somebody's fucking thing, eh?
what I think I meant to say was...
is the swan still there? Yeah, the swan's...
how can fucking swans not fucking be somebody's fucking thing, eh?
how can that be?
what I think I meant to say was, when he first arrived, he wasn't quite sure about it.
you know, there's that big, dual carriageway when you get off the train?
it mightn't have been here when you were here last, Harry.
well, as soon as he got into, like, the old town proper, and he saw the canals and the bridges and, you know, the swans and that, well, he just fucking loved it then.
couldn't get enough of it, the medieval part of town.
it was just that initial, dual carriageway thing sort of put him off for a second.
don't know if I remember a dual carriageway.
must be recent.
hasn't spoilt it, has it?
no, no, no, it's just that initial thing.
and you know what?
as we were walking through the streets, there was this sort of freezing fog hanging over everything, and it made it look almost like a fairytale or something.
and he turned to me, do you know what he said?
What'd he say?
he said, "Ken, I know I'm awake, but I feel like I'm in a dream."
yeah? He said that?
Yeah.
meaning, like, in a good dream?
Yeah. Of course, like in a good dream.
Oh, good. I'm glad he likes it there.
I'm glad we were able to give him something.
something good and happy. Because he wasn't a bad kid, was he?
huh?
he wasn't a bad kid, was he?
listen, take down this address. Raamstraat 17.
that's "Raam," like "Ram," but with an extra "a.
Raamstraat 17.
you got that?
Yes, Raamstraat 17.
good. There'll be a man there tomorrow morning at 9.;00, his name's Yuri.
Yuri. He'll give you the gun.
ring me on the public phone at Jimmy Driscoll's about 3.;00 or 4.;00 tomorrow, after it's done.
after what's done?
are you being thick?
no. Listen, I like Ray.
he was a good bloke, but when it all comes down to it, you know, he blew the head off a little fucking kid. And you brought him in, Ken.
so if the buck don't stop with him, where does it stop?
Ken?
if the buck don't stop with him, where does it stop?
it stops with me, Harry. That's an easy one.
look, don't get shirty, Ken.
listen, I'm just glad that I was able to do something for the boy before he went.
do what for the boy?
you know, have him get to see Bruges.
I'd like to go to see Bruges again before I die.
what was it he said again about... Yeah, "It's like a dream.
I know I'm awake, but I feel like I'm in a dream.
Yeah.
give me a call when he's dead.
that's my fucking girlfriend, you asshole.
Eirik, what are you doing?
where are you from, fucker?
ireland, originally.
and you think it's okay to come over to Belgium and fuck another man's girl?
look, I didn't know she had a boyfriend, all right?
and I haven't fucked her, anyway. Ask her. I'd only put me hand on it.
Eirik, put the gun down!
get down on your knees and open your mouth.
don't start being silly.
get down on your...
exactly at what point was it that all skinheads suddenly became poofs?
used to be, you were a skinhead, you just went around beating up Pakistani 12-year-olds.
now it seems a prerequisite to be a fucking bum-boy!
that's not gonna help you, man.
ray, there's only blanks in that gun.
Eirik, don't!
now who's the fucking bum-boy?
you, you fucking bum-boy!
Chloe, what exactly is going on here?
I can't see! I can't see!
of course you can't fucking see! I just shot a blank in your fucking eyes!
is this fella your boyfriend? No. I mean, he used to be.
well, what's he doing here?
we... We rob tourists, sometimes.
I fucking knew it was too good to be true!
I knew you'd have never shagged me, normally.
No! That's not true, I...
I called it off tonight. I told him not to come tonight.
why did you come tonight?
EIRIK: Chloe, I can't see, I swear it!
stop whingeing like a big gay baby.
I haven't had a shag in months!
I can't see out of this eye, Chloe! I have to go to the hospital!
I'll drive you.
great! Now the whole night's ruined!
No!
you can stay if you want. I just don't know how long I'll be.
I just knew someone like you would never like someone like me.
I just knew. What do you mean, someone like me?
you know, someone nice.
call me. Please.
EIRIK: Chloe!
Cha-ching!
have you got some sort of problem?
no, no problem.
four beers in 20 minutes. No problem.
fuck off.
Jimmy: Beer and a red wine.
I'll be back.
how's the movie going?
it's a jumped-up Eurotrash piece of rip-off fucking bullshit.
like, in a bad way?
your girlfriend's very pretty.
she ain't my girlfriend. She's a prostitute I just picked up.
didn't know there were any prostitutes in Bruges.
you just have to look in the right places.
brothels are good.
well, you've picked up a very pretty prostitute.
thank you.
you from the States?
Yeah.
but don't hold it against me.
I'll try not to.
just try not to say anything too loud or crass.
Hey-ho. Drowning your sorrows, huh?
what sorrows? You know, being a sad, old, ugly little man.
one gay beer, please.
how'd your date go?
my date involved two instances of extreme violence.
one instance of her hand on my cock and my finger up her thing, which lasted all too briefly. Isn't that always the way?
one instance of me stealing five grams of her very-high-quality cocaine, and one instance of me blinding a poofy little skinhead.
so, all in all, my evening pretty much balanced out fine.
you got five grams of coke?
I've got four grams on me and one gram in me, which is why me heart is going like the clappers, as if I'm about to have a heart attack.
so if I collapse any minute now, please remember to tell the doctors that it might have something to do with the coke.
give us a gram, then.
I thought you were laying off, because it makes you depressed?
you know what? Right now, I don't really give a fuck.
why didn't you wave hello to me today when I waved hello to you today?
I was on a very strong horse tranquilizer today.
I wasn't waving hello to anybody, except maybe to a horse.
huh? What are you talking about?
just horseshit.
you from America?
Yeah. But don't hold it against me.
well, that's for me to decide, isn't it?
are you from America, too?
no, I'm from Amsterdam.
Amsterdam.
Amsterdam is just a load of bloody prostitutes, isn't it?
Yes. That's why I came to Bruges.
I thought I'd get a better price for my pussy here.
huh?
you two are weird.
would you like some cocaine?
I've also got some acid and some ecstasy.
herve Villechaize, I know, did.
the dwarf off, I think, The Time Bandits, did.
lots of midgets...
dwarves, top themselves.
hmm. Shitloads.
would you ever think about it?
huh?
would you ever think about killing yourself because you're a midget?
fuck, man! What kind of question is that?
we're just chatting, aren't we?
see, Ken, this is the kind of hotel Harry should have put us in.
a five-star, with prostitutes in.
you know, sometimes, I think Harry doesn't even give a shit about us at all.
has he still not called?
no. Still hasn't called.
no news is good news, eh?
Ray: Hmm.
who's she?
Jimmy: There's gonna be a war, man.
I can see it.
there's gonna be a war between the blacks and between the whites.
you ain't even gonna need a uniform no more.
this ain't gonna be a war where you pick your side.
your side's already picked for you.
and I know whose side I'm fighting on. I'm fighting with the blacks.
the whites are gonna get their heads kicked in!
Jimmy: You don't decide this shit, man.
well, who are the half-castes gonna fight with?
the blacks, man. That's obvious.
but what about the Pakistanis?
the blacks. What about...
think of a hard one.
what about the Vietnamese?
the blacks!
well, I'm definitely fighting with the blacks if they've got the Vietnamese.
so, hang on.
would all of the white midgets in the world be fighting against all the black midgets in the world?
Yeah.
that would make a good film!
you don't know how much shit I've had to take off of black midgets, man.
that's...
undeniably true.
see, Jimmy, my wife was black.
and I loved her very much.
and in 1976, she was murdered by a white man.
so, where the fuck am I supposed to stand in all this blood and carnage?
did they get the guy who did it?
a friend of mine got him.
Harry Waters got him.
so tell me, Jim, whose side do I fight on in this wonderful war?
I think you need to weigh up all your options and let your conscience decide, Ken.
two manky hookers and a racist dwarf.
I think I'm heading home.
Yeah. I think I'll come with you.
what's... Back off, shorty!
you don't know karate.
don't say you didn't have it coming.
don't say you didn't have it coming.
Shortarse!
meeting Yuri.
Yes, I'm Yuri.
Mr. Waters said that might be necessary.
there are a lot of alcoves in the Koningin Astrid Park.
you use this word, "alcoves"?
Alcoves"? Yes. Sometimes.
there are not many people around in these alcoves in Christmastime.
if I were to murder a man, I would murder him here.
are you sure this is the right word, "alcoves"?
Alcoves," yes. It's kind of like "nooks and crannies.
"nooks and crannies," yes. Perhaps this would be more accurate.
"nooks and crannies," rather than "alcoves." Yeah.
you are going to do it, aren't you? Mr. Waters will be very disappointed...
of course I'm going to fucking do it.
it's what I do.
your friend was behaving rather oddly this morning.
Oddly? How?
well, he asked me about the baby, and if I wanted a boy or a girl.
I said I didn't mind as long as it's healthy, of course.
but then he gave me 200 euros to give to the baby.
I refused, obviously, but he was quite insistent.
would you give it back to him when you see him?
I don't want to appear ungrateful, but it seemed like all the money he had.
do you know where he is now? He said he was going to the park.
sorry, Ray.
I'm sorry.
ray, don't!
fucking hell! Where the fuck did you come from?
I was behind the thing. What the fuck are you doing, Ray?
what the fuck are you doing?
nothing.
Oh, my God!
you were gonna kill me. No, I wasn't.
you were gonna kill yourself!
I'm allowed to.
no, you're not!
what?
I'm not allowed to and you are? How's that fair?
can we go somewhere and talk about this, please?
I wasn't gonna go through with it, Ray.
you fucking looked like you were gonna go fucking through with it.
Where'd you get that gun?
a friend of Harry's.
fuck, man.
let me see it.
silencer, too.
nice.
mine's a bloody girl's gun.
I'm keeping it. Pardon me?
give me me gun back. You're not getting it back.
you're a suicide case.
and you were trying to shoot me in the fucking head.
you're not getting that gun back.
a great day this has turned out to be.
I'm suicidal, me mate tries to kill me, me gun gets nicked and we're still in fucking Bruges.
listen, I'm gonna give you some money and put you on a train somewhere.
back to England?
you can't go back to England, Ray. You'd be a dead man!
I want to be a dead man.
have you been missing something?
you don't want to be a dead man, Ray.
I killed a little boy!
then save the next little boy.
just go away somewhere, get out of this business and try to do something good.
you're not gonna help anybody dead.
you're not gonna bring that boy back.
but you might save the next one.
what am I gonna be, a doctor?
you need exams.
do anything, Ray. Do anything.
Ray: What a wanker!
he said this whole trip, this whole being in Bruges thing, was just to give you one last, joyful memory before you died.
in Bruges?
the Bahamas, maybe.
why fucking Bruges?
I suppose it's cheaper.
the rest of the acid and the ecstasy.
can I have me gun back, please?
what am I gonna do, Ken?
what am I gonna do? Just keep moving.
keep on moving.
try not to think about it.
learn a new language, maybe?
sure, I can hardly do English.
that's one thing I like about Europe, though.
you don't have to learn any of their languages.
just forget about home for a while.
see how the land lies in six years, seven years.
seven years is not that long.
it's longer than that boy got.
me first fucking job.
great hitman I turned out to be.
some people just aren't cut out for it, Ray.
are you?
when are you going back to England?
I'll head back in a couple of hours or something.
Harry's not gonna be mad at you, is he? For letting me go?
I'll sort out Harry.
just tell him I'll have probably killed meself in a fortnight, anyway.
you won't, will you, Ray?
Harry? It's Ken.
listen to this noise.
do you know what that is?
Yeah, I know you know it's a train. Do you know what train?
well, it's a train that Ray just got on, and he's alive and he's well, and he doesn't know where he's going and neither do I.
so if you need to do your worst, do your worst.
you've got the address of the hotel. I'll be here waiting.
because I've got to quite like Bruges, now.
it's like a fucking fairytale or something.
Harry.
Harry!
what?
it's an inanimate fucking object.
you're an inanimate fucking object!
now, you lot be good for your mummy and lmamoto, okay?
cause Daddy's got to go away for a few days.
where are you going?
I've got to go to Bruges.
Bruges? Where's that?
it's in Belgium.
why would anybody have to go to Belgium?
cause I've got to sort something out.
is it something to do with the phone?
it's something to do with Ken.
it's a matter of honor.
well, it ain't gonna be dangerous, is it?
well, of course it's gonna be dangerous if it's a matter of fucking honor!
you are bringing the fellas with you?
tell me you're bringing the fellas with you.
Harry.
I'm sorry for calling you an inanimate object.
I was upset.
you're Irish? Yes.
what is your name?
Derek Perlurrl.
you hit the Canadian.
you hit the Canadian.
I "heet" the Canadian? I don't know what you're talking about.
that's him! That's the motherfucker.
you hit the Canadian, yeah?
Canadian? Shit.
we're taking you back to Bruges. Brilliant.
aye aye.
YURl: Take your pick, Mr. Waters.
an Uzi?
I'm not from South Central Los fucking Angeles.
I didn't come here to shoot 20 black 10-year-olds in a fucking drive-by.
I want a normal gun for a normal person.
I knew he wouldn't kill the guy.
I could see it in his eyes when I was telling him about the alcoves.
about the what? The alcoves.
the alcoves in the Koningin Astrid Park.
Oh, I also have some dumdums.
you use this word, "dumdums"? The bullets that make the head explode?
Dumdums, yeah.
would you like some of these dumdums?
I know I shouldn't, but I will.
motherfucker.
is he talking to me?
no, Eirik's on your side, Mr. Waters.
your young friend blinded him last night.
ray did?
I was trying to rob him and he took my gun from me.
and the gun was full of blanks, and he shot the blank into my eye.
and now, I cannot see from this eye ever again, the doctors say.
well, to be honest, it sounds like it was all your fault.
what?
I mean, basically, if you're robbing a man and you're only carrying blanks, and you allow your gun to be taken off you, and you allow yourself to be shot in the eye with a blank, for which I assume the person has to get quite close to you, then, yeah, really, it's all your fault for being such a poof.
so why don't you stop whingeing and cheer the fuck up?
YURl: Eirik, I really wouldn't respond.
I thought you wanted the guy dead?
I do want the guy dead. I want him fucking crucified.
but it don't change the fact that he stitched you up like a blind, little gay boy.
does it?
thanks for the gun, Yuri.
well?
the boy is suicidal, Harry.
he's a walking dead man.
keeps going on about Hell and purgatory...
when I phoned you yesterday, did I ask you, "Ken, will you do me a favor and become Ray's psychiatrist, please"?
no. What I think I asked you was, "Could you go blow his fucking head off for me"?
he's suicidal"?
I'm suicidal. You're suicidal. Everybody's fucking suicidal!
we don't all keep going on about it!
has he killed himself yet? No. So he's not fucking suicidal, is he?
he put a loaded gun to his head this morning. I stopped him.
he... What? This gets fucking worse!
we were down in the park...
let me get this right. You were down in the park?
what's that got to do with fucking anything?
let me get this right. Not only have you refused to kill the boy, you've even stopped the boy from killing himself, which would have solved my problem, which would have solved your problem, which sounds like it would've solved the boy's problem.
it wouldn't have solved his problem.
Ken, if I had killed a little kid, accidentally or otherwise,
I wouldn't have thought twice.
I'd have killed myself on the fucking spot. On the fucking spot.
I'd have stuck the gun in me mouth on the fucking spot!
that's you, Harry. The boy has the capacity to change.
the boy has the capacity to do something decent with his life.
excuse me, Ken. I have the capacity to change.
Yeah, you do. You've the capacity to get fucking worse!
Yeah, now I'm getting down to it!
Harry, let's face it.
and I'm not being funny, I mean no disrespect, but you're a cunt.
you're a cunt now, you've always been a cunt.
and the only thing that's gonna change is you're gonna become an even bigger cunt.
maybe have some more cunt kids.
leave my kids fucking out of it. What have they done?
you fucking retract that bit about my cunt fucking kids!
I retract that bit about your cunt fucking kids.
insulting my fucking kids! That's going overboard, mate!
I retracted it, didn't I?
still leaves you being a cunt.
Yeah, I fucking got that.
Where's Ray now?
Oh, right about now, Ray is in one or other of the one million towns in mainland Europe it's possible to be in, other than here.
I'll get all the money back to you soon as I get through to me friend.
it's not a problem, Raymond.
and I'll get all your acid and your ecstasy back to you, too.
english humor!
I'm assuming you've got your gun on you.
that Yuri bloke's a funny fella, isn't he?
he does yoga.
the alcoves.
was he going on to you about the alcoves?
the alcoves in the Koningin Astrid Park.
Harry, I know you gotta do what you gotta do.
it's a bit crowded round here, you know?
well, I'm not gonna have a shootout in the middle of a thousand fucking Belgians, am I?
not to mention the other nationalities, just on their holidays.
hmm.
to see the swans and the Gothic and all the fairytale stuff, eh?
are you trying to fucking wind me up? No, Harry.
on top of calling me a cunt and calling me kids cunts.
I might just have to fucking shoot you right here.
Christ!
let's go up the bell tower.
be quiet up there this time of evening.
let's go up there.
Yeah. Canadians.
I feel a bit bad. They didn't kill John Lennon, did they?
anyway, supposed to turn up to court here in two days.
are you going to turn up?
don't know.
what have I got to stay for really?
the most beautiful woman you've ever seen in all of your stupid life.
the tower is closed this evening.
no way. It's supposed to be open till 7: 00.
the tower is usually open until 7: 00.
yesterday an American had a heart attack up the tower.
today the tower is closed.
here, cranky, here's 100 for you. We're only gonna be 20 minutes.
the tower is closed this evening.
understand, Englishman?
Jimmy, I've been wanting to say
I'm really sorry for karate-chopping you the other night.
that was way out of order.
you know, Ray, I'd find it easier to believe and forgive you, somehow, if the two of you weren't laughing straight in my fucking face!
it's for the goddamn movie, man.
it is a nice town, Harry.
I'm glad I got to see it.
I didn't mean to be taking the piss out of it being a fairytale place.
it is a fairytale place.
it really is. Hmm.
it's just a shame it's in Belgium, really.
but then you figure if it wasn't in Belgium, if it was somewhere good, there'd be too many people coming to see it. It would spoil the whole thing.
well, I'm glad I got to see it before I died.
what are you doing?
what are you fucking doing?
I'm not fighting anymore, Harry.
all right, then I'm blowing your fucking head off.
don't come over all Gandhi. What are you fucking doing?
Ken, stop messing about, please.
pick up your gun. I know I'm going to beat you anyway 'Cause you're a spaz, but... Harry,
I'm totally in your debt.
the things that have gone between us in the past,
I love you unreservedly for all that.
what?
for your integrity.
for your honor.
I love you.
the boy had to be let go.
the boy had to be given a chance.
and if to do that, I had to say, " Fuck you, and fuck what I owe you, "and fuck everything that's gone on between us," then that's what I had to do.
but I'm not fighting you.
and I accept, totally, everything you've got to do.
I accept it. Totally.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
well, you say all that fucking stuff, I can't fucking shoot you now, can I?
it's entirely up to you, Harry.
it's entirely your call.
all I'm saying is I'm not fighting.
Oh, you fucking cunt!
look, I'm not gonna do nothing to you just 'Cause you're standing about like Robert fucking Powell.
like who? Like Robert fucking Powell out of Jesus of fucking Nazareth!
my fucking leg!
the psycho dwarf turns out to just be a loveable little schoolboy, and it's all some kind of Boschian nightmare.
kiss my ass!
I guess at least there weren't any black people involved, eh, Jimmy?
I wasn't...
I wasn't talking about...
there's gonna be a war between all the blacks and all the whites.
and all the black midgets and all the white midgets, which would actually be really good.
that's just cocaine.
he didn't even want the Vietnamese on his side!
that's just cocaine.
listen, we're filming down by the pointy building tonight.
it might actually be good for once.
you guys should come along.
we... I think we're just gonna have a quiet one tonight, Jimmy.
that's how it is!
in another life.
they're great, aren't they?
you didn't. You didn't!
Mr. Waters? Mr. Waters?
who's that? It's Eirik.
the blind boy? Yeah.
Yes.
what do you fucking want?
the guy you're looking for, the guy Ray, he's downstairs at the bar.
I'm sorry, Ken.
but you can't kill a kid and expect to get away with it.
you just can't.
where? To the left when you come out.
the bar to the left.
Ken!
Ken! Ken!
Harry's here.
what?
take my gun.
Ken?
Where's my gun?
Where's my gun?
I'm gonna die now, I think.
Oh, Ken!
Jesus!
Mr. Blakely said you had left.
I need the key to the room right now.
quickly, now!
and you gotta go home right now. It's very, very dangerous here.
all right? Go home! Right now! Okay.
Marie: No, I won't let you up there! Put that gun away, right now!
Harry: Lady, get out of my fucking way, please.
no, I won't. I won't get out of your way.
you'll have to go through me.
well, obviously, I'm not gonna through you, am I, with a baby and that?
I'm a nice person.
but could you just get out of the fucking way, please?
Marie!
just let him come up, it's okay.
Harry, swear not to start shooting until she's left the hotel.
I swear not to start shooting till she's left the hotel. I totally swear.
well, I'm not going anywhere.
this is my hotel.
so you can fuck off!
I suppose you've got a gun up there? Yeah.
then what are we gonna do? We can't stand here all night.
why don't you both put your guns down and go home?
don't be stupid. This is the shootout.
Harry, I've got an idea. What?
my room faces onto the canal, right?
I'm gonna go back to me room, jump into the canal, see if I can swim to the other side and escape.
right. If you go outside and round the corner, you can shoot at me from there and try and get me.
that way, we leave this lady and her baby out of the whole, entire thing.
do you completely promise to jump into the canal?
I don't want to run out there, come back in 10 minutes and find you fucking hiding in a cupboard.
I completely promise, Harry.
I'm not gonna risk having another little kid die, am I?
so, hang on, I go outside, then I go which way, right or left?
you go right, don't you?
you can see it from the doorway! It's a big fucking canal!
all right. Jesus! I've only just got here, haven't I?
okay. On a count of "one, two, three, go," okay?
okay.
what? Who says it?
Oh, you say it.
you guys are crazy.
are you ready? Ready.
set? Set.
one, two, three, go!
keep driving!
no way. You're way too far away.
the little boy.
that's right, Ray.
the little boy.
Oh.
I see.
no, Harry.
he's not...
you've got to stick to your principles.
RAY.; There's a Christmas tree somewhere in London with a bunch of presents underneath it that'll never be opened.
and I thought, "If I survive all this, I'll go to that house, "apologize to the mother there, "and accept whatever punishment she chose for me.
prison, death, it didn't matter.
because at least in prison and at least in death, you know,
I wouldn't be in fucking Bruges.
but then, like a flash, it came to me, and I realized, "Fuck, man, maybe that's what Hell is.
the entire rest of eternity spent in fucking Bruges!
and I really, really hoped I wouldn't die.
I really, really hoped I wouldn't die.
a man fires a rifle for many years...
and he goes to war.
and afterward, he turns the rifle in at the armory...
and he believes he's finished with the rifle.
but no matter what else he might do with his hands...
love a woman, build a house...
change his son's diaper...
his hands remember the rifle.
you are no longer black, or brown, or yellow or red!
you are now green!
you are light green or dark green!
do you understand?
sir, yes, sir!
Swofford!
sir, yes, sir!
you the maggot whose father served in Vietnam?
sir, yes, sir!
Outstanding! Did he have the balls to die there?
sir, no, sir!
too fucking bad! He ever talk about it?
sir, only once, sir! Good! Then he wasn't lying!
are you eyeballing me with those baby blues?
are you? Sir, no, sir!
are you in love with me, Swofford? Sir, no, sir!
you don't think l look good in my uniform, Swofford?
sir, the drill sergeant looks fabulous in his uniform, sir!
so you're gay, then, and you love me, huh?
sir, l'm not gay, sir!
do you have a girlfriend, Swofford? Sir, yes, sir!
guess again, motherfucker! Jody's banging her right now!
get on your face and give me 25, for every time she gets fucked this month.
down on your face!
it was shortly after meeting Drill Instructor Fitch that I realized that joining the Marine Corps might have been a bad decision.
what in the fuck is this?
sir, it's a recruit's drawing of a footlocker, sir!
Jesus, Joseph and doggie-style Mary!
that is a pile of dog shit.
sir, the recruit's never been good at drawing, sir!
why the fuck are you my scribe, then?
lsn't my scribe supposed to know how to draw?
sir, the recruit doesn't know!
the recruit thought the scribe was supposed to write, sir!
of course the recruit doesn't know!
the recruit doesn't know because l haven't told him!
[Groaning] All right, cum-for-brains...
show me exactly where your skivvies and running shoes go.
sir, the recruit can't think...
while the drill instructor is hitting him on his head, sir!
you can't think while l'm giving you a few love taps?
how the fuck are you going to fire your rifle when grenades are going off in your face?
what the fuck are you even doing here?
sir, l got lost on the way to college, sir!
so, now my hands were dick skinners.
a flashlight was a moonbeam. A pen was an ink stick.
my mouth was a cum receptacle.
a bed was a rack. A wall was a bulkhead.
a shirt was a blouse.
a tie was still a tie, and a belt a belt.
but many other things would never be the same.
Swofford. What kind of fucking name is that?
lt's English.
my great-grandfather came over here in the 19th century.
whatever.
l'm putting you in Golf Company.
lt's full of retards and fuck ups.
maybe you can elevate the sons of bitches a little.
or maybe not.
next.
jarhead. noun. Slang for " Marine. "
origin from the resemblance to a jar of the regulation high-and-tight haircut.
the Marine's head, by implication, therefore also a jar.

Hey!

Yeah, l was assigned to Second Platoon.

[Groaning] Oh, fuck.
Yeah, we switched out the hot brand.
little fuck-fuck trick we play on the new guys.
nice.
you want a brand, you gotta earn it.
welcome to the Suck.
still got that stomach flu, Swofford?
l can't seem to shake it.
that's all right. Not everyone's cut out for the Marines.
but for me, there was nowhere else. That was the truth.
after all, I was made in a war.
here's Mr. and Mrs. Swofford on R&R from Vietnam.
Honolulu Hilton, 1969.
I can't watch...
and neither can you.
and here are some other things I can't show you.
visiting my sister.
making muffins with Mom.
breakfast conversations with Dad.
but here are some things you can see.
taking a dump.
thinking about going to college.
studying after school with my girlfriend.
Oh, my God, l love you. l love you, too.

l heard it took six guys to pull that little branding trick on you.
your file says that you ain't too fucking dumb, either.
so you better get un-sick most motherfucking ricky-tick...
because there's a chance that you could be a scout sniper.
what the fuck is this?
"the Stranger by Camus."
that's some heavy dope right there, Marine.
"mary however..."
"that's when we ran up to the office..."
lndoc class starts on Monday. l suggest you have your ass there.

you play any instruments?
l played the trumpet in third grade, Staff Sergeant.

a little, for small holiday concerts and festivals.
good. You ain't gotta be Chuck Mangione.
all l need is a bugler.

Oh, yeah.
good! Parade field, 0600.
all right, thank you, Staff Sergeant!
my pleasure.
can l get my book?
there's 60 of you. l only need eight.

lf you think you're worth some shit
staff Sergeant Sykes!
private Swofford reporting for bugle tryout!
lndoc! Atten-hut!
l don't give out too many special treats...
but this morning, we have a very special treat.
private Swofford here is going to play Reveille for us.

Yes, Staff Sergeant. Good, that's a classic.
will you shut the fuck up? There is no bugle program.
you sizzle-dick motherfucker.
who do you think you are, some kind of Kenny G or some shit?
no, Staff Sergeant. Good.
now to the rest of you, do you have what it takes to be the meanest, the cruelest, the most savage unforgiving motherfuckers in God's cruel kingdom?
Yes, Staff Sergeant!
will you be able to one day say, "Yea, though l walk through the valley of the shadow of death, l will fear no evil..."
"because l am the baddest motherfucker in the goddamn valley"?
Yes, Staff Sergeant!

[Groaning] Oh, shit! Fuck, l can't see!
back to the grunts, dick face!
in order to engage your target, you must see your target, but your target must not see you.
Shevitz.
you laugh, you die. Scratch your nose, you die.
you shift your weight to take a piss, you will die.
you want to shit, you better shit in your pants.
still kind of cute, huh, Swoff?
no, sir.
this suit will hide you. You will become a tree. A rock.
you are mud, sand, and dust.
still funny? No, sir.
in order to fire accurately, you must be able to judge distance and wind direction.
how far are those trees?
500 yards. No.
600. 300.
300. How did you figure that? Three football fields.
three football fields, that's right.
you take what you know and then you multiply.
please don't use your dicks.
they're too small, and l can't count that high.
l don't wanna hear, " 400, 000 inches. "
now, wind. You use what you have.
use a flag, use a plume of smoke, a little bit of dust.
spit on your finger and hold that bitch up.
these are formulas that you can use...
but in the end, you have to trust your gut.
details, gentlemen.
details is gonna be the difference between you killing your target and your target killing you.
we've all been taught that, " Thou shalt not kill. "
but hear this.
fuck that shit!
now, consider your target.
lf you are lucky, in that window will one day emerge the figure of the enemy.
the JFK shot.
the pink mist.

spotter, shooter.
spotter, shooter.
you may now open your case, pull out your M40A1 rifles.
once you've done that, you will repeat after me.
this is my rifle. This is my rifle.
there are many like it, but this one is mine.
there are many like it, but this one is mine.
without my rifle, l am nothing.
without my rifle, l am nothing.
without me, my rifle is nothing.
without me, my rifle is nothing.

I wanted the pink mist.
good evening. Iraq invaded and took over its tiny neighbor, Kuwait, today.
that set off worldwide protests and drew sanctions from the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union.
the government of dictator Saddam Hussein claimed it went in at the invitation of revolutionarie who had overthrown the Kuwaiti government.
we have appealed to all our friends around the world including the United States to come to our aid and assistance.

me, l had a choice either join the Marines or go to jail.
and you know what the shit of it is?
Yeah, if you'd gone to jail-- Don't spoil the joke, asshole.
lf l'd have went to jail, l'd be getting out today.
would you like some nuts? No, thanks.
Yes, are they warm nuts?
no, l believe they're room temperature.
well, maybe later you can come and warm up my nuts.

cocksucker knew the price of every whore from Olangapo to Stockholm.
and here we are, headed to the desert. No pussy in 1, 000 miles.

what would you be doing if you were a civilian?
staying up late, jacking off, playing Metroid, trying to get to that ninth level?
you know what happens when you get there?
nothing. You just start all over again.
how long you think we'll be there? Two weeks?
less, man. We'll be back so fast...
we'll still be shitting out those nuts.
good luck, now. Goodbye, now.
good luck, now. Goodbye, now.

Damn!

good afternoon, Marines. Good afternoon, sir!
Jesus, did you just land in a war zone or a funeral parlor?
good afternoon, Marines! Good afternoon, sir!
I just felt my dick move.
for those of you who don't know me...
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Kazinski, your battalion commander.
we are now a part of Operation Desert Shield.
now, just north of us...
saddam Hussein's got one million Iraqi soldiers.
and some of those boys have been fighting since you were nine or ten years old.
they are tough.
they will stop at nothing.
they've used nerve gas against the Iranians and the Kurds.
now, here's a picture.
I know what you're thinking.
you're thinking, "Let's kick ass and take names and end this shit the day before yesterday."
Yeah!
but the bureaucrats have a lot of jawboning to do.
so for now, these Iraqis who have raped and pillaged poor little Kuwait are not yet in our gun sights.
our current mission is to protect the oil fields of our good friends in the Kingdom of Saud until further notice.
and gentlemen, I'm talking a lot of oil.
a lot of oil.
so you will hydrate, you will train...
you will adjust to this desert, and you'll hydrate some more.
and you will be ready.
you will maintain a constant state of suspicious alertness...
and one day soon...
saddam Hussein is gonna regret pulling this sorry shit.
Ooh-rah!
we're gonna kick some lraqi ass!
what did you say?
we're gonna kick some lraqi ass, sir!
Oh, hell, son.
what, you gonna win the Medal of Honor all by yourself?
what's the rest of my battalion gonna do?

you know, I think it's time for me to retire.
I can't hear a fucking thing!

Oh, boys, I just got a hard-on!
man, this defensive position shit sucks, huh?
we need to get out of this shit hole soon.
l need to shoot something!
you're gonna get all you want soon enough.
first to fucking fight!
Yeah. For what?
l've been around these old white fuckers all my life.
they got their fat hands in Arab oil.
the motherfuckers drink it like it's beer.
that's why we're here, to protect their profits.
you're full of shit. He's full of shit.
who do you think gave Saddam all his fucking weapons?
we did!
fuck politics, all right? We're here.
all the rest is bullshit.
Yeah.
everyone else is unpacking, man.
l'm taking a break.
what you got?
photos.
she's hot. Yours? Yes, man.
you better shoot yourself in the foot...
and get a ticket home...
because Jodies are gonna be all over her!
[All exclaiming] Look at her! Ain't she an animal!
they won't leave her alone!
that's nice for a white chick, man. Thank you, man.
nice? Come on.
l'd drink a gallon of her pee just to see where it came from.
all right, all right, all right.
this is hardcore right here.
this is close to porn. Let me see that one. Let me see.
she's got a baby fist down here.
dream on, brothers, dream on.
l'm storing that for later, man. l'm storing it for later.
Hey, y'all horny fucks wanna see a beautiful woman?
Yeah! Let's see it. Let's see it.

Yeah, boy! Give it up, give it up.

Oh, no! Please don't love me!

Hey, she's pregnant, man.
that's why she's so beautiful, man.
this is what it's all about right here, man.
[All booing] Hey, fuck you guys!
married guys.
l'm telling you, married guys lose brain cells by the billions.
lf the Corps wanted you to have a wife...
they would have issued you one.
Yeah, they would have issued you one.
Yeah!

Hey, can l see your pictures? Yeah, sure, man.
Thanks.

don't worry, she will be. She'll be right there.
she's gonna look beautiful up there. Yeah. Thank you.
l wonder what she's doing right now.
no way to know.
now, here are the rules.
when you talk to these reporters, you do not get specific.
tell them that there's no better shooters in the world than Marine snipers.
tell them that you're happy to be here.
you're proud of the mission. All right?
and you can't wait to mash the fuck out of these lraqis.
anything other than that comes out of your mouth...
l get fucked up.
and if l get fucked up, l'm gonna fuck you up.
take your shirts off. Show your muscles.
you've been working out. This is censorship.
this is what? Censorship.
you're telling us what we can and can't say to the press.
that's un-American.
Yeah, what about freedom of speech? The Constitution?
no, you signed a contract. You don't have any rights.
you got any complaints, you complain to Saddam lnsane...
and you see if he gives a fuck.
why, that's exactly what Saddam Hussein does.
you're treating us the same way.
you are a Marine.
there's no such thing as speech that is free.
you must pay for everything that you say.
we're rolling. Sound, speed.
you're a Marine here in Saudi Arabia.
are you glad to be here?
Oh, yes, ma'am, l'm glad to be here.

the country which has given freedom to me and to my family.
and it is an honor to fight for that freedom.
to defend my country and to serve my country and to learn skills to eventually go into law enforcement.
are you scared?

l can hear their fucking bombs already.
l can hear their bombs.
and l'm fucking scared, yeah.
don't tell my Staff Sergeant, though, all right?
so in case of a chemical attack what provisions do your men have for that?
this is what we call the NBC suits.
that's nuclear-biological -chemical protective suits.
we also have a mask. This is the M17 A1 mask which is fitted with a drinking tube...
so these guys can drink from their canteens without taking off their masks.
Oh, really? Want to try it?
no, thanks, but can l hold it? Yeah, sure.
lt's heavy. Yeah, it is.
but you know, we need these in order to protect us.
they fight with all this in all this heat?
Yes, they do. They fight with it and...
as a matter of fact, let me give you a small demonstration of that.
Kruger, get rid of the ball.
get rid of the ball.
Kruger! Get rid of the fucking ball.
ball. Fuck.

we're gonna further this demonstration.
men, these M1 7 A1 drinking tubes are designed to work perfectly with your canteen and your mask.
take the narrow part of the tube with your fingers extended and joined...
and place it into the appropriate receptacle on the canteen lid. The lid on my canteen's fucked.
watch your mouth. l got another one for you right there.
my hydration tube is busted, Staff Sergeant.
we're gonna die of dehydration. We're not gonna die. Just cool it.
staff Sergeant, my drinking tube fell off at the gas chamber at Pendleton. lt's been four months.

so l suggest you get your shit together.
you can start by taking all that down.

Yeah, whatever.

for most problems...
the Marine is issued a solution.
if ill, go to sickbay.
if wounded, call corpsman.
if dead, report to graves registration.
if losing his mind, however no standard solution exists.
no standard solution exists.

l write all of his letters.
'dear sweet Gloria, l wish l was up in you now...
with a finger in your ass.
'love you, Captain Skinboat. "
l studied classics at Dartmouth.
lt's a good school.
$40, five gallons.
Hey, Swoff. Which way do l mount this?
what does it say?
'Front toward enemy. " Oh, yeah.
got to be a clue. Thanks. Sorry.
Fergus, you take my watch tonight, l'll pay you back.

Oh, great, a tree. Merry Christmas.

lt's time to do it all! lt's time for me to...
sorry, guys. l'm really sorry.
lt was my sausages.
fucker's fucked now.
so do you have all of that unauthorized beverage out of your system?
whose watch was that, Swofford?
lt was mine. lt was yours.
but since you don't know how to handle responsibility...
we are demoting you.
you are now a private.
you think you're the only one that's bored around here?
because when this war begins, and it will begin...
l don't want you covering my ass.
so guess what's next?
instructions for the effective burning of shitters.
the Marine will need the following.
one metal fence post, one pair of welder's gloves...
[flies buzzing] five gallons of diesel fuel, and one box of matches.
hold it right there, Marine.
so you are the fucking idiot who tried to burn down my camp.
Yes, sir.
stick that back in there.
lt's already full of diesel fuel, sir.
l don't care if it's full of Chanel No. 5.
keep it. -Thank you.
never been on a bike?
Mmm-mmm.
never.
you got to wear one of these.
okay.
you've got to hold on tight right there.
here we go. You ready?
I'm ready. -You sure?
Yeah.
Hey, babe, relax. She'll be back when she gets back.
quit telling me to relax. Okay?
what the fuck?
Wow. Funny how someone conveniently forgot to tell me that they were driving home on a motorcycle.
do you know how many people I've seen come into the hospital paralyzed from motorcycle accidents?
I'm a very safe driver, Nic.
Yeah, that is so not the point that I'm making, Paul.
Joni knows that this is something I'd just never allow.
mom, I'm 18 years old.
yeah?
I won't even be living here in, like, a month.
Yeah, well, you're living here now. Yeah?
well, why don't you get a jump on it and pretend like I'm not?
she's never talked to me like that before.
you know, if you backed off a little bit on the restrictions, you probably wouldn't have so much conflict.
Oh, really? You think so, Paul? Is that how it works?
Jules: What's going on?
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
Paul's just giving me some child-rearing lessons.
I'm just saying...
listen, when you've been a parent for 18 years, you come and talk to me, okay?
I'm just making an observation.
yeah? Well, I need your observations like I need a dick in my ass!
Nic: Joni?
honey. Look, I was upset, okay?
you know how I feel about motorcycles.
Yeah, I know how you feel about them.
but I'm an adult now, and you have to respect that, okay?
good night.
good? Good?
Yeah, that's perfect. Thanks.
Hey, Paul.
Hey, Jules. What's up?
it's all right. I just wanted to say I'm sorry about last night.
hey... I was really embarrassed.
Hey, it wasn't you. It was her who wigged out.
I think she's, you know, she's just having a really hard time.
you know?
Yeah. You really don't have to defend her. Seriously.
and about that kiss, that's... You know, I don't do that.
I completely sensed that, yeah.
so...
I just wanted to clear the air.
the air is cleared.
no, it's clear.
no, Paul, I can't!
Why? You don't want to?
no, I have a guy outside!
Oh, yeah. Right, the guy.
Oh, God.
okay, wait. Wait.
well! Hello!
Yeah! Yeah!
okay, not so hard. Not so hard. Okay.
what?
Oh, my God! Paul: Yeah?
come on.
Luis: Excuse me?
you gotta be fucking kidding me!
paul: Oh, God. Oh, God.
I can't fucking believe it. Okay.
you gotta go talk to him. Are you gonna go talk to him?
okay. Fuck. Oh, God.
shit.
Hey, what's up?
where do you want the stones?
stones?
over by the fence.
what?
I was using the bathroom.
do you need to use the bathroom?
okay, then. I'll be right back.
okay. Take your time.
Yeah, I know.
all right. Lay-up.
paul: All right.
now you don't have to go easy on me because you're winning.
nobody likes a show-off, man.
you gotta go behind the back.
God.
can I ask you a question?
would you rather be buried or cremated?
that's your question?
I'd rather be cremated.
I think I'd...
I think I'd rather be buried.
but why? I mean, you're just gonna be taking up more space in the earth.
I don't know. The idea of being, you know, torched into a chalky white substance has got me a little freaked out.
why does it matter to you? You're not even gonna be conscious.
okay, well, maybe, I don't know,
I want a place for people to come and visit me one day.
but why? You're gonna be dead.
you won't even know they're there.
okay. Take it easy.
come on.
so, what do you like better, Nike or New Balance?
nike. Oh, God, here we go.
Sasha: God, I love your necklace! Can I see it?
sure.
it's so beautiful.
thank you.
is it African?
Yes, it's Ethiopian.
did you get it there?
no, I got it at a flea market in Brooklyn.
is that where you're from?
no, I'm from here.
cool. Hey, guys, how you doing?
good. -How's the food?
it's great.
good? You're not gonna eat your chicken?
it's so yummy. -It's good?
Yeah, it's really good.
I'm sorry, but I have to take the lovely Tanya away for a moment.
all right. It was lovely talking to you, ladies.
you, too. -You, too.
okay, I'm sorry, but your donor daddy is giving me the sex vibe.
no, he's not. He wouldn't do that.
why not? He's not my dad.
God, Sasha, that's totally gross!
not everybody wants to have sex with you, okay?
especially when you act like a slut.
fuck you.
well, it makes you seem insecure and desperate.
I'm not insecure and desperate.
I'm just a normal, sexual person.
maybe you'd understand that if you weren't so uptight.
fuck you. I'm not uptight.
Stella: Oh, my God, these heirloom tomatoes are amazing.
Oh, yeah, they're in season.
you know, Joni brought some home from Paul's garden the other day.
they were huge.
so the kids have been spending time with him?
Yeah. Yeah, they're spending all kinds of quality time together.
well, you're lucky. You're lucky that the kids bonded with the donor.
I mean, you hear so many nightmare stories.
no, no, it's great. They all just get along famously.
apparently, Paul can do no wrong.
excuse me. Could we get another bottle of the Seavey Cabernet?
thank you. I'm okay. I'm okay. I don't need any more.
Yeah, you're alone on this one, Nicole.
Hey, so have you guys gotten into the whole acai smoothie craze?
Jules: Acai fruit packs.
Yeah. No, but they're pushing them like crack at Whole Foods.
joel is so addicted to it. He buys it by the case.
Joel: Here's what I do.
I throw one in the blender with bananas, frozen strawberries and hemp milk.
and I'll tell you what, it is pretty sensational.
just fucking kill me. Okay?
honey. I'm sorry, guys, but I just can't with the fucking hemp milk and the organic farming.
and, you know, if I hear one more person say that they love heirloom tomatoes,
I'm gonna fucking kill myself. Okay?
Oh. And do you know that we're composting now?
Oh, yeah. "No, don't throw that in the trash.
you have to put it in the composting bin "where all the beautiful little worms will turn it into this organic mulch, and then we'll all feel good about ourselves." You know?
I can't do it, okay? I can't fucking do it.
Hey, babe. How about some green tea?
you know what, Jules? I like my wine, okay? So fucking sue me.
and FYI, red wine has a chemical called resveratrol in it, which has been proven to significantly extend human lifespan.
if you drink, like, a thousand glasses a day, yeah.
fuck you.
I'm sorry. -Stella: It's okay.
go to her.
what the hell is going on with them?
Oh, my God. What is going on with you?
it's this whole Paul thing.
it's just driving me crazy, all right?
I feel like he's taking over my family.
no. He's...
BARTENDER: Can I get you anything?
no thanks, no. He's not. He's not.
okay.
okay, I'm sorry, all right?
I guess I'm just exhausted.
Yeah, maybe you just need to take some time off, recharge.
right?
Yeah, right. Who's gonna pay for that?
I mean, look, I'm sorry, but, you know, I feel like I'm carrying the whole load here.
Yeah, 'cause that's the way you like it.
that's the way you keep control.
what are you talking about?
come on, you hated it when I worked.
you wanted me at home taking care of the kids.
you wanted a wife. -That is just not true.
no, you didn't like any of the nannies, and you sure didn't back my career.
what are you talking about? I just helped you start another business.
Yeah, so you can feel better about yourself.
no, Jules. So you can feel better about yourself.
are you even attracted to me anymore?
BARTENDER: Would you still like the wine?
Nic: No, thank you. We'll just take the check from inside, please.
Bartender： Okay, no problem.
Oh, yeah. Pull my hair.
paul: Okay. Oh, yeah.
paul: Ow!
I really want a cigarette. I haven't smoked since Laser was born.
do you smoke? Do you have a cigarette?
sometimes, but I don't have any.
I could go run out and get you some.
Yeah. Yeah, no, no. No, don't go.
do you think
I'm some sad-sack, middle-aged lesbian?
you know, I have been trying to come up with a way to describe you to my friends, and now I finally have it. Thank you so much.
fuck you.
you don't want to get that?
no, no. I want to get some of this.
Paul, it's Joni.
I just wanted to call you and apologize for my friend Sasha.
you know, when you put your hands on her shoulders,
I think that she thought that...
Hey, Joni. It's Paul. -Don't get that.
listen, I'm really sorry about Sasha the other night.
no, I didn't even... No, no. No... Really, I didn't even notice that.
I hope you didn't feel uncomfortable.
no, not at all. I...
not at all.
okay, sure. Well, as long as... -Hold on, hold on.
wait, wait, wait.
no, just get off me.
I'm just gonna... Give me one second.
get off.
Joni?
Oh, is my mom there?
your mom? No, no. She split.
she went on a Home Depot run.
did you go to Home Depot?
Yeah. Just got back.
that was fast.
Yeah, no lines.
what's that look you're giving me?
what look?
the look that you're giving me right now.
no. That's no look. That's just my face.
Yeah, I'm not gonna play this game with you.
you know, you can keep your judgments to yourself.
I don't ask why you blow your nose all the time.
if you have a drug problem, then that's your business.
no, I don't have a drug problem.
I have allergies.
then why are you a gardener?
cause I love the flowers.
man, this is not gonna work.
you know, I'm gonna pay you through the end of the day, and then we're through. Okay?
thank you very much.
Thanks. Thank you.
can we talk about...
no, we can't.
Luis: A little bit. You know why?
cause there's nothing to talk about.
I think you know.
you know.
look.
I know you've all been enjoying your time with Paul.
and I know that I haven't been as open to him as everybody else, and that's caused some friction between us.
but I'd like to try and change that, okay?
so I was thinking it might be nice if we all had dinner at his house sometime.
now that way, I could get to know him a little bit better, and I could see all the good work that Mom's been doing in the backyard.
what do you think? -Yeah? Sure.
Nic: Yeah. Sure.
yeah?
Joni: Yeah.
great.
it's not... I'm not done yet.
you know, I'm not, you know...
no. No, I know.
I haven't done all the planting or anything.
but I wanna see the process.
you know, like other colors, other than green colors.
well, that's okay. I just wanna see the process.
great.
need a hand? Jules: Sure.
hold on. Let me help you.
ready? Okay.
right here.
we can't be doing this.
I know. This is...
I'm married.
the kids.
Yeah, and I love Nic, so...
Hey. I don't...
it was fun while it lasted.
sorry.
I bought you some cigarettes.
Jesus. What is wrong with me?
I shouldn't have fired Luis like that. That was so wrong.
Yeah, I think you're being hard on yourself.
you know, I mean, things just get messed up sometimes.
no, no, that wasn't messy. That was fucked up.
I am so fucked up.
I think I'm falling for you.
Oh, God, Paul.
don't.
tonight was a really good night.
Yeah.
that one table had, like, five bottles of wine.
it was crazy. It was a big night.
you know, Joni's really pretty.
I think she's got some of your genes.
you think? I think she looks more like her mom, but thanks.
I appreciate that.
it was really cute seeing you in dad mode.
yeah?
Yeah.
it made me want to fuck you.
yeah?
Yeah.
you know, I've been missing our sleepovers.
Yeah, we haven't been doing that in a while, have we?
you want to meet up later?
Tanya, you're so sexy and beautiful, but I...
I don't think we should do that anymore.
you know, what we have is really fun and easy, but I don't want to be that, like, 50-year-old guy who's just hanging out, you know?
I really do want to have a family, and I need to be doing that with someone who's, like, ready to go there with me.
okay.
Tanya.
yeah? Fuck you.
it's locked.
Yeah, I mean, obviously I have more to do down here.
I gotta fill it in, but this is the general idea.
no, it looks great.
yeah?
it's so indigenous.
really. I am so proud of you.
Yeah, you like it? Yeah?
I'm so proud.
I love you, honey.
I love you, too.
I'm so glad you like it. -It's incredible.
Oh, man.
and now, wait, how's that guy Luis working out?
man, I had to fire him.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, he has a drug problem.
you're kidding! What drug?
no. I know... I...
blow, I think.
you're a natural, kid.
Jules I know. Paul: Good.
you're a natural.
you can never have too much olive oil.
big no-no.
Oh! I forgot.
NIC, I got a bitching 1998 Alma Rosa that I think you're just gonna love.
you know what? I think I'm gonna stick with water, but thank you so much.
you sure? Yeah.
Jules.
Nic: Paul, this steak is delicious.
paul: Thank you.
really, it's... What is the seasoning?
guys, we just misted it with a little truffle oil, right?
Mmm-hmm.
paul: It's so easy. Nic: Wow.
what a good idea. We ought to try that. Right, honey?
Mmm-hmm.
and it's done to perfection.
yeah? It's not too rare?
Oh, no, no.
it's juicy and tender. Exactly what rare's supposed to be.
right? I mean, I got people coming into the restaurant, they see the slightest bit of red, they just start freaking out.
isn't that annoying?
that happens to me all the time when I'm grilling.
paul: Hey, red is rare.
Hello, it's bloody.
I mean... Hello?
yoo-hoo. Hello, thank you.
Yeah, I mean, if you're in Argentina, and you ask for rare, they bring you a cow still mooing on the plate.
I really want to go to Argentina. Buenos Aires is supposed to be...
Hey. I noticed your record collection over there.
wow, it's quite an eclectic mix, you know.
thank you very much, Nic.
you're welcome.
you don't meet too many straight guys who love Joni Mitchell.
you sure don't.
you like Joni?
no, not really. We just named our daughter after her.
Really? Oh, shut the front door.
come on. Really? You never told me you were named after Joni M.
it's so dorky. I don't like to bring it up.
that is so cool.
no, what's your favorite Joni album? -It's not cool.
blue.
right? My brother from another mother.
Oh, my God. I mean...
listen, I spent half of high school in my room crying to that album.
that record, it kills me.
it doesn't stop. -No.
river. California.
a Case Of You.
all I Want.
Nic: Oh, God. Paul： Right?
I am on a lonely road
and I am traveling, traveling, traveling
looking for something
paul and Nic: What can it be
I hate you some, I hate you some
I love you some
I love you
both When I forget about me
I want to talk to you
I want to shampoo you
I want to renew you again and again
applause, applause
life is our cause
when I think of your kisses
my mind see-saws
do you see, do you see
do you see, do you see
do you see how you hurt me, baby
and I hurt you, too
that's why we both get so blue
paul: Bravo.
don't quit your day job, Mom.
paul: Hey. It's already hard enough to open your heart in this world.
don't make it any harder.
you're right. I'm sorry. It was a wonderful rendition.
beautiful, thank you.
I like this guy.
paul: Why, thank you, Nic.
okay. Paul, where's your bathroom?
it's just right here around the corner.
all right. Thanks.
and you know what? I am gonna have a glass of the Alma Rosa, okay?
all right.
so, I think you'd really love Argentina.
Joni: I really wanna go there.
paul: Buenos Aires is literally, like, one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
paul: I was in a rainstorm in the Grand Canyon.
Joni: Can we go? -I'll take you.
paul: A big rattlesnake when I was in the desert in Baja, Mexico.
we should. I'll take you to Baja.
I was in the desert and...
Joni: What's it like there?
paul: It's beautiful.
I was surfing, but then there was no waves, so we climbed up into the mountains.
and I hear a rattling, and it was a rattlesnake.
and so I was scrambling. I didn't know what to do, so I reached out for a rock, and then I threw it at the rattlesnake...
did you guys spend some time up there?
Yeah, a long time ago. Yeah. Yeah.
beautiful, beautiful beaches. You'd like it.
paul: It's really nice having you guys over.
I don't entertain here very much.
Cheers.
Jules: All right. -All right.
to an unconventional family.
you and Paul were getting along like gang-busters.
you're sleeping with him, aren't you?
what?
just be honest with me, okay?
don't make me feel crazier than I feel right now.
where is this coming from? I don't...
well, I found your hair in his drain.
because...
because I was working, and I got dirty, and I took a shower.
yeah? Did you take a nap, too?
are you in love with him?
no.
are you straight now?
no. It has nothing to do with that!
I've just felt so far away from you lately.
Oh, right. So it's my fault?
No! Who said anything about fault?
just listen to me!
I'm listening!
what?
I just... I just...
I needed...
what? To be fucked?
no. Appreciated.
well, it's always what I'm not doing for you, isn't it?
well, okay. Here's what I don't do to you.
I don't work out my issues by fucking other people!
he's not just "other people."
No! He's our sperm donor.
you couldn't have picked a more painful way to hurt me.
where are you going?
I need water!
Oh!
shit!
shit.
Joni.
I don't want to talk to you.
can we just talk about what happened?
I said I don't want to talk to you.
okay. I understand.
laser? Honey?
what?
I know that you and Joni heard what was going on, and I wanted to tell you that what happened with me and Paul is over.
there's nothing going on now.
okay.
I know it'll probably take you a while to process your feelings around this, but I just wanted to tell you that I'm here if you ever want to talk about anything.
is there anything you want to talk about?
not really.
how's Nic?
she's a mess.
they're not talking. I've never seen her like that.
is it him?
Hello?
Hey, darling. How you doing?
you're such a phony.
excuse me?
you act like you're so groovy and together, but you're not.
you're a shitty person!
Oh, no.
what happened?
with my mom?
listen, you gotta let me just come and talk to you, honey, please.
what's wrong with you?
Joni, listen to me. Please...
don't call me again.
Hey, Paul, look at these cukes. Aren't they awesome?
no.
fuck.
fuck!
Jules: Hello?
I just talked to Joni.
what happened? What's going on?
NIC found my hair in your bathroom.
fuck. In the drain.
the other night?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Hey, you know what?
I just say we go for it. I mean, it's all out in the open now.
I mean, let's just do this thing.
Paul...
I don't care what you say, Jules. We can...
this can work, you know. This isn't a mistake.
Paul.
this isn't just happening for no reason.
let's get the kids together.
Paul, come on. I'm sick of this life.
let's make this happen. I'm ready.
I'm gay.
fuck it. I wanna...
Jesus.
Hello?
Hey, hey. Slow down, tiger.
you don't wanna get sick.
I'm fine.
are you gonna talk to him?
Yeah.
Hey. -Hey.
I like the scruff. It's sexy.
thank you.
excuse me. We're in the middle of a conversation.
that's okay.
can I talk to you?
Yeah.
excuse me.
man: Green chilies, queso sauce, blue corn tortillas.
this is a poblano pepper.
so, what's up?
are you okay?
fine.
I just wanted to get another pillow. The couch is really saggy.
your back hurts?
Yeah. It's super achy.
well, you should take some Advil.
Hey, how was the party?
fine.
were there a lot of people there?
I don't know.
are you drunk, honey?
no.
Hey, did you drive yourself home?
Yeah. What's the big deal? I'm not drunk.
you seem drunk to me.
Yeah, well, you should know.
what did you say to me?
nothing. I'm going to bed. Nic: Hey, honey. I...
what do you want from me? I did everything you wanted!
I got all A's! I got into every school I applied!
now you can show everyone what a perfect lesbian family you have!
don't talk to your mom like that!
you're really gonna tell me how to act? Now?
you know what? I am still your mother, and you...
don't touch me! I'm so sick of both of you!
Hey, did you remember to pack the lamp I gave you?
Mmm-hmm.
well, we can always get stuff there, you know.
I mean, if your room's too dark, or you need extra bedding or...
I'm not going to Siberia, Mom.
I can't believe it's your last dinner at home.
are you seriously about to cry?
I wish you were gay. You'd be much more sensitive.
that's probably Sasha. I'll get it.
laser: How long a drive is it?
Nic: About eight hours, I think.
what are you doing here?
I just needed to talk to you before you left. Please.
there's nothing to talk about.
I wanted to apologize again.
I can't tell you how ashamed, how much I regret what happened.
so, like, everything that happened between us, what was that? That was just bullshit?
no, no. It wasn't bullshit at all.
okay?
I know that I don't have much credibility right now, but I really, really care about you.
and I wanna know that I'm gonna be able to see you again someday.
I mean, I... Do you think that could ever happen?
I don't know.
I just wish that you could've been...
what?
better.
Oh.
you have got some balls, mister.
hold on, Nic.
no, no, no. You hold on.
you know what you did to my kids?
shit.
let me tell you something, man, this is not your family.
this is my family! -I know that, Nic.
no, you don't know.
you don't know, and you know why?
because you're a fucking interloper.
if you want a family so much, you go out and make your own!
I need to say something.
it's no big secret your mom and I are in hell right now, and...
bottom line is, marriage is hard.
it's really fucking hard.
just two people slogging through the shit, year after year, getting older, changing.
it's a fucking marathon, okay?
so, sometimes, you know, you're together so long, that you just...
you stop seeing the other person.
you just see weird projections of your own junk.
instead of talking to each other, you go off the rails and act grubby and make stupid choices, which is what I did.
and I feel sick about it because I love you guys, and I love your mom, and that's the truth.
sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most. I don't know why.
you know, if I read more Russian novels, then...
anyway...
I just wanted to say how sorry I am for what I did.
I hope you'll forgive me eventually.
thank you.
Nic: Oh!
nice, huh? -This is big.
it's bigger than I thought it would be.
okay.
did you remember the lamp? Thank God. -JULES: Here it is. Here.
honey, where do you want this?
do you want it on your desk? Do you want it next to the bed?
guys, I've got it.
I think the sheets are in here. Mom.
guys, I can do it, okay? No, no, I can do it.
mom.
Jules: Is that...
mom, I got it. I can do it.
Thanks. Can I just have a minute, please? Okay?
okay. Okay.
okay?
okay.
great.
Hey.
Where'd you guys go?
Nic: We had to move the car.
I thought you left.
we wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
give us some credit.
it's gonna be weird not having you around anymore.
sorry to leave you alone with them.
it'll be okay.
Hey, guys, come on.
Hey, it's okay. I'll speak to you soon, okay?
okay.
I don't think you guys should break up.
no? Why's that?
I think you're too old.
Nic: Thanks, Laser.
you see a guy holding a list, you know he's married.
he's in the frozen-food section carrying a small basket, he's single.
I hang out by fruits and vegetables. Better chance of getting a guy who's healthy.
probably the best place is Home Depot or any hardware store.
you just walk up to the cutest guy and say:
do you know where I can get nailed? I mean, nails?
pardon me, I've been drinking all afternoon.
and that way he knows, one, that you're easy...
...and two, that you like to drink.
I thought a great place to meet girls would be night school where they teach English.
because these girls would be from foreign lands...
...and maybe still a little disoriented from the journey...
...and I would look attractive because I speak English very goodly.
but in the end, it did not work out as I had hoped.
I mean, basically, I was told to take a hike in 14 languages.
where do you meet people? I don't know, they're everywhere.
why, is there a problem?
no. No way, I'm not going out with this guy.
just call him. Say hello. He's in my book club.
why is there a woman here? - It's his wife.
they're separated, but he didn't want to photoshop her out......if you're not interested. They are in Hawaii.
it's the Four Seasons. This could be you in the photograph.
Aloha.
well, if you change your mind. - I've got a picture too.
is that why you're all here? The whole family?
everyone has a picture for me? - This is an intervention, Sarah.
he's great. - A beautiful girl like you can't just give up.
there's life after divorce.
you were married to the same woman for 45 years, Dad.
what do you know about divorce? - Precious little, I admit.
the black specter of two lives torn asunder.
not helping, Dad.
I wish your mother were here, God rest her soul.
she'd know what to say. - "Put on another pot of tea.
that's what she'd say. The Irish answer to all problems.
well, it worked most of the time. - Who is this?
I have no idea, but if you're interested, I'll Google him.
is this it for food in this house, like, eight crackers?
and what are these? Are these bananas?
I think they were at one time. - I'll take one.
I guess I forgot to shop this month. - What are you gonna do, sis?
I mean, really, it's been eight months. - Dad's giving-up idea sounds intriguing.
I could become the crazy aunt who moves in down in the basement.
put a cot in for me, some herbal teas. I'd like to get a dog, if that's okay?
Marc, don't you have a friend for Sarah?
a Friend for Sarah." I'm now an episode of Little House on the Prairie.
come on, you must know somebody. - Not really.
but if you want to have an affair, I do know a couple of married guys.
we'll let that be our fallback, okay? - Okay.
an affair, that's a terrific idea. - My husband to the rescue.
don't cover mine.
I think affairs should go on the other side.
Yeah.
Hey, Jake.
Hey, Charlie.
divorce is final.
you're a free man.
I don't know if... is the appropriate sentiment. Four years...
...woman I loved, I got my ass kicked. - High-five.
not that kind of moment either.
down low? - Just because I want this to stop.
you are officially the worst client I've ever had.
thank you. - Let Lisa have everything.
even the judge wanted you to keep those boxing gloves.
she really liked you. - I liked her too, as far as judges go.
no. I mean, really.
wow, that's a good-looking cougar.
excellent stuff. You think she'd like to buy a handmade, stainable teak boat?
maybe if it came with private lessons.
everybody wants all that Tupperware...
...those computer-designed, fiberglass-composite things.
I mean, don't even look like boats.
they look like boats when they whiz by your wooden guy.
that was one race, and I've made some adjustments, Charlie.
wood boats can win, trust me on that. - They can't win.
that's why people don't want them.
they can't win, but they lose beautifully.
and the whole experience is just better. Look at this.
there's a continuity at stake here, Charlie.
this is more than a boat.
this is a time machine. - If you paid this much attention to Lisa...
...you'd still be together. - This is true.
but you know what? If I had to do it it all over again, I wouldn't.
I wouldn't. Lisa taught me about sadness...
...about human frailty...
...and how unbearably fleeting happiness can be.
I'm gonna owe her for the rest of my life. - Oh, you'll be paying. Monthly.
hope you don't mind that I brought Mother Teresa.
are you kidding? I love this girl. Mother Teresa, do you have a friend for me?
Hey, is everything all right at home?
Yeah, Jennifer just gets tired of all the family gatherings.
too many old stories. It makes her feel left out.
Yeah. Kevin used to say that.
I still say it. - I say it too.
it seems hard now, Sarah, I know...
...but you get a chance to make a new life for yourself.
thank you, but in the marketplace of available women...
any guy would be lucky to get you. You're smart, you're funny...
...even pretty when you're not wallowing in self-pity.
am I wallowing? Really?
you're not the wallower in the family. Carol is the wallower.
me? I never wallow. I suffer in silence.
no, that's Christine. - Thank you, Michael.
no, no.
Sylvia Plath. - This is why people...
...don't have large families anymore.
Bye. I love you. - Bye.
Bye, Bill. - Love you, Carol.
see you, Dad. - Thank you, I think.
Bye, Chris. Bye.
see you later, Dad. - Bye, Daddy.
Bye.
there's someone special waiting for you, Sarah.
I know it. Someone worthy.
Kevin was not, on his best day...
...Good enough for you, sweetheart.
now you tell me.
why not?
you know I love you and I love Lisa, but I think you're both better off.
we sure weren't making each other happy there at the end.
or the beginning.
or the middle.
I mean, don't get me wrong, we all wanted to sleep with Lisa, but marriage...
that's not right. - I said that out loud, didn't I?
you did. - I better strike that from the record.
no, lawyers get to do that. I'm instructing you to disregard that.
I think women have the whole thing planned.
really, the whole thing.
an epic narrative in their heads. You know my theory about this?
when you meet, they have the whole story written.
but you don't get to read it.
but if you go off script...
...right? They write you out of the story.
I got written out of Act 3.
now you're in Act 4, where I get you banged every night of the week.
Charlie, I'm toast. I just got shredded. I am...
it's time, healing time. I'm on the bench. - Hey. Hey.
I'm out of the game. Bench me, bench me.
Hey. - Benched.
I'll be right with you.
Hi. Can I help you? - Single chicken breast, please.
for an extra 75 cents, you can get the whole fryer here.
two breasts, two thighs and a wing.
thank you. I don't know when I'd eat all that.
it's just an extra 75 cents. - It's not the 75 cents.
I hate to see food go bad.
we got a hundred recipes. You can cook them, freeze them and...
look, listen to me, Mister. I'm divorced, okay?
I eat alone, usually standing over the sink.
I don't want chicken hanging around, okay?
okay. - Thank you.
Hey. There she is.
good morning. How are you? - Good morning.
I called you last night to see if you were up for a movie...
...or bowling or group shampooing. - I'm sorry. Eric's parents are in town.
Mr. And Mrs. Stalin. I'm under house arrest.
weren't they just here? - Thank you.
I don't know why they can't stay at a hotel. Nothing I do makes them happy.
and they make Eric so nervous, he's like the Tin Man.
you have to hang in there, Leo. You and Eric are my model...
...for a successful relationship. - I fear for you, child.
anyone have anything exciting happen this weekend to share?
my Uncle Mike slept over.
uncles and aunts are very important to us, aren't they?
he's not really my uncle, but my mommy makes me call him that.
when he's there, I can't sleep with my mommy because he's in her bed.
anyone else have anything they'd like to share?
Yes, Austin.
my parents are trying it apart for a while.
we have a theme, June. - Yes, we do.
and Mom says my dad is incorrigible. That means he likes other women.
good.
one, two.
let me try.
that's a hop.
one, two, that's a new step. Very good.
Molly, you wanna try the sticks? - Yeah, come on, Molly.
very good. Keep it going like that.
watch. - No, I'm doing it.
Austin!
good Lord, it's a gusher.
let me see your teeth.
Hey, Bubba. - Look who's here.
daddy!
are you all right? - Yep, I'm fine.
he had a decent bloody nose for a while, but he's fine now.
you didn't have to rush right over. - A kid bleeds, I show up. It's house rules.
you wanna get your stuff together now? - Yeah.
then I need a minute alone with Ms. Nolan. - Okay. Bye, Ms. Nolan.
Bye.
no. No. No.
so, Ms. Nolan...
Sarah, please. - And I'm Bob.
actually, everybody calls me Bobby.
I've been trying to change it since third grade.
I'm a pushover for Bobbys...
...ever since my first boyfriend, Bobby Healy, just...
you know?
I forget, is it "always discuss your personal history with parents" or "never discuss"?
it's "always discuss." Besides, I find it comforting.
so has Austin told you anything about...?
about you and... - Yeah.
that you're taking a break from your marriage and you're incorrigible.
that phrasing came from his mother.
I wouldn't have put it that way, but... - I'm sorry.
if there's anything you think I need to know, tell me.
I will. - Sometimes with Austin, you can forget.
because he seems so mature. - I know.
the other day he asked about my retirement plan.
well, he cares about you, and he wants you to be financially secure.
you know Austin adores you. I can see why.
thank you, Bob. - I might prefer Bobby after all.
I mean, I like the... I like the history.
two guys alone in the afternoon watching Doctor Zhivago.
there's something gravely wrong here. - It's all there, man.
the yearning, the suffering, a woman you'll pursue...
...through blizzards, across continents.
a love so real, even after you're dead it still hurts.
that's all I want. - You need to get out.
you do. You need to see real people. - You wanna watch it again?
no. I want to go out. Come on, I previewed some Internet ads for us.
internet ads? Come on, I want Zhivago's Internet ad:
tragic doctor/poet in desperate pain seeks...
...like-minded playmate for long snowshoe across Eurasia.
what do you bet he gets a hundred responses?
we'll start with bisexual Asian women who fly-fish.
no Internet ads. - This is for you. I hate to fly-fish.
no, you don't. - What about Sherry?
I gave you her number. You never called. - Sherry?
sherry's 24. Her range of interest extends from kickboxing to Tae Bo.
she slept with half the guys in my office.
then why do you want to set me up with her?
she slept with half the guys in my office.
she's in her early 20s. You know the epic narrative I talked about?
hers would not only be secret, it would be incoherent.
I wouldn't get past the cover page.
I mean, I'm looking for something more than Sherry.
hopelessly romantic, young 50s widower...
...seeks lady friend who enjoys the slow bloom of affection.
loves dogs, children and long, meandering bike rides.
I will be carrying a single yellow rose.
I gotta meet this guy. - Where are your boob shirts?
my what? - Your boob shirts.
don't worry, I brought some of mine. - Oh, boob shirts.
I can't wear that. - Okay, I have some dating tips for you.
I got them from Sports Illustrated. Solid gold.
Yes, that's always been my bible for personal relationships.
at least listen to the tips.
your sister has gone to a lot of trouble. - Okay.
one, maintain eye contact.
but be sure it isn't too intense. You aren't a hawk eyeing its prey.
good that you told me. I might have done my hawk thing.
two, men respond sexually when they think women are excited by them.
Really? - "The more you like what you see...
...the more your pupils will open wide to take it all in.
open your pupils.
Oh, my God.
I'm dating again. I can't do this! - It's okay. Come on.
no, you'll be fine, it's okay. - It'll be fun.
what if he wants to have sex? What if I want to?
you don't understand. It's been a long time, Christine. I could freak out.
what if I can't control myself?
you're meeting for muffins in a public place. I think you'll be safe.
dad? - Sarah.
my darling girl.
darling, don't you put the sunshine to shame.
what are you doing here?
that's a fine how-do-you-do from one of my favorite daughters.
I'm sorry, it's just that I'm meeting a... why do you have a yellow...?
is that a rose? - It is a rose, if the truth be told.
but by any other name...
and it's for a lady friend, isn't it? - That is, in fact, the very purpose.
No! - Now, Sarah, come on.
it is a natural course of this life that your dad would have a lady friend by now.
I feel your mother whispering her approval to me every day.
and would this lady friend be someone who might enjoy...
...the slow bloom of affection, perhaps?
that would be grand, yes.
I'm your date, Dad.
I am. I answered my own father's personal ad.
don't laugh. It's not funny!
it shows I brought you up to know the diamond from the riffraff.
a young 50, Dad? You're 71.
and when was the last time you rode a bike?
meandering or any other way? - Well, think of it as poetry, darling.
as who I am in the bottom of my soul.
and, Sarah, my darling.
what? - I'm glad you've started dating again.
dad, please. This is disturbing on so many levels.
at least let me have the rose. - I can't.
I'm seeing someone else at 4: 00.
hello. You've reached Sarah Nolan. Leave a message if you want to.
Sarah, it's me, Christine. Pick up.
come on, Sarah, I already talked to Dad.
who else knows? - No one.
come on, Carol has to know.
why does Carol have to know? Couldn't I once know something before she does?
she's there with you, isn't she?
no. - Hello, Carol.
Hi, Sarah. I was telling Chris it's a shame I didn't know about this before...
...because I could have called Uncle Chet. We could have doubled.
this story is going to be immortalized into family history, isn't it?
told and retold at Thanksgiving dinner, year after year.
Oh, not just Thanksgiving. I think it's a good Christmas story too.
Bye, guys. - Wait.
tell the truth. On a scale of one to 10, how would you rate Dad as a date?
hot, super hot?
don't be mad at me for this, okay?
the last time you said that to me you stole my boyfriend. Danny Shea.
I did not steal Danny Shea.
I haven't forgiven you, by the way. - Stop. He was a terrible kisser.
he kissed just fine with me. - Okay. Here goes.
I went online, pretended I was you...
...and put your profile on Perfect Match. Com.
you're making this up.
you can't just sit back and passively answer...
...other people's ads anymore. We are on offense.
well, forgive me if I'm a tad gun-shy after my last date with my father.
come on, at least look at your profile.
that's my high school graduation picture.
that's all I had. That or your wedding photo.
Voluptuous"? Carol!
every woman listed claims to be at least voluptuous.
some are "gorgeous inside and out," most are "sexually confident.
voluptuous, sensuous DWF seeks special man to share starlit nights.
must love dogs." - I put that in for you.
and yet I'm still pissed.
I must have done something right. You have 18 responses.
you listened to them, didn't you?
I like 3, 11 and 14. Christine likes 2 and 8.
michael liked them all. But you decide for yourself.
what do you mean by voluptuous? Do you mean big breasts...
...or do you mean fat?
I love dogs too.
I have a great sense of humor, but you could probably already tell that.
yo.
my name is Walter Taylor. I'm an attorney.
don't hang up. I like opera. Don't delete me.
so anyway, I get all dressed up...
...and I walk down the stairs and I see...
...my father sitting there holding a single yellow rose.
and it dawns on me...
is something wrong? - Well, no offense, it's just...
I thought you'd be younger, that's all.
well, you said your age range was 25 to 45.
I guess I was hoping more for 25.
eighteen. That's legal.
it's nice to be out.
I've been feeling kind of blue lately.
I know, you mentioned on the phone, Lennie, that you've... kind of depressed.
did I cry? - Well, a little bit.
I've been on 17 first dates this year.
no second dates.
one went...
...to check her coat and never came back.
one jumped out at the light when it changed.
well, we're almost through the salad. That's a good sign.
no.
Lennie.
please. Don't.
please. Lennie. No.
if you're happy and you know it clap your hands come on! If you're happy
and you know it clap your hands oh, God!
come on, get up. Get her. Get her.
damn.
don't be upset. I come from a large family.
lots of male cousins, brothers. Used to this sort of thing.
three out of five.
Oh, that's all right. Maybe later. - Come on.
your table's almost ready. - Good. We're working up an appetite.
food here is fabulous. It's not cheap, though.
well, I offered to pay my half.
and what did I tell you?
Marshall's girls don't pay.
beautiful.
you'd look really good in handcuffs.
Charlie, my boy, some nice-looking pieces here.
Really? I didn't see anyone. - I meant the artwork.
bet this cost a bundle. - Hey, guys.
Hi! - Speaking of artwork.
Hi, Sherry. - Hi, Charlie. Hi, Jake.
how are you? Let's do two.
that's how they do it in France. - You having fun?
well, I feel sorry for the artist at these things.
all this talent on display, and everybody here's just trying to get laid.
I know I am.
you never called me, Mister. I waited and waited.
I know I am.
I'm sorry, Sherry, it's just that I'm not ready right now to be in a serious relationship.
and with somebody as wonderful and as beautiful as you...
...I just wouldn't expect anything less.
why can't you be sweet like that, huh? - Sherry!
Hey, guys. - Short attention span.
you're a sick guy, you know that?
just another in a long line of colossal mistakes.
I'm not answering an Internet ad.
look at this. "Voluptuous and sensuous. Must love dogs." wonderful.
look at the picture.
well, she is appealing.
she'll be good-looking when she grows up.
I'm surfing porn sites like always...
...I keep getting kicked over to PerfectMatch. Com...
...which is not where I want to be...
...and this girl's profile keeps repeating, like a sign from heaven. And I thought of you.
tell the prom queen thanks, but no. I'm still benched.
too late. You're meeting her at 11. Bring a dog.
no, I'm not.
it's okay.
stop that growling!
use your words.
stop, sit.
stop, sit.
stop. Sit. - I don't think he knows "stop" or "sit.
what else have you got? - Bruno, focus.
roll over and play dead.
Hey, look at that. Look at that. - That's very impressive.
you Sarah? - Jake.
Yeah, hi. - Yeah. Hi.
I didn't recognize you without the cap and gown.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. - Yeah.
this is really amazing. - Yeah.
it is. When he plays dead, he really plays dead.
you don't know the half of it. He can stop his heart like a Sufi mystic.
does he sleep on a doggy bed of nails? - As a matter of fact, he does.
he feels nothing. Or perhaps he feels too much.
I think he wants his treat now. - You think so?
while he's playing dead? It might ruin the effect.
I don't know. He's your dog. - He's not. He's my friend Charlie's.
so you're here under false pretenses. - No, not at all.
you said "must love dogs," not "must own dogs." I do love dogs.
in fact, I had one with my ex.
she was allergic, went into anaphylactic shock.
so we had to put her down. Dog.
not the wife. I'm kidding about both.
this is a beautiful canine you have here.
Hi. - Yes, this is Mother Teresa.
Yeah, she plays with lepers?
comforts the poor? Yeah. How long you had her?
technically, she's not really mine. She's my brother's.
I'm shocked and saddened.
false pretenses. - Well, we are related. She's family.
and I do really love dogs, and my ex was allergic also.
Yes, he often had "anaphyphlectic" shock.
you're making that up.
Yes, I am. - Me too.
tell me, I'm just curious about one thing.
why did you write "voluptuous"?
Oh, my... - No! I did not mean to be rude at all.
it's just that voluptuous, that tends to go the other way...
...when someone uses that phrase.
towards the full-figured end of the spectrum.
I didn't know there was a full-figured spectrum.
it's one of those words they use in personal ads...
...like "Rubenesque" or "weight proportionate to height.
Hey, it's your ad. You can say whatever you want, I'm...
just for the record, girl says "athletic," she means "flat-chested." which you're not.
but... This isn't coming out right.
look, you know, I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm a little nervous. I'm not used to meeting people this way.
Really? You seem very practiced and smooth.
your ad doesn't do you justice. - Well, maybe you should rewrite my ad.
well, maybe I don't want to. - And why not?
because maybe I don't want anyone else to answer it.
did you plan on saying that sometime today?
no, I didn't. But it's good, isn't it? - It is good.
it's a good line. - Maybe we should try this over again.
Hi, I'm Jake.
Sarah.
so why would you even write an ad? You don't seem that desperate.
why would you answer one? Talk about desperate.
I'm not. I mean, I didn't. It was my friend's. He gave it to me.
I didn't write it. My sister did. - Your sister's ad.
your brother's dog. Those your shoes?
Oh, my. Look at the time! Come on, honey.
what I'm trying to say is I'd like to get to know you.
I have to get this dog home, and you don't want to go over on your rental.
maybe we could try this another time. You know, without the dogs.
you bet.
I'll call you.
Sarah, for the record...
...you are kind of voluptuous in a minimalist sort of way.
I'm not sure I'm up for this dinner at Dad's new girlfriend's house.
he seems really excited about her. - Where are Marc and Jason?
they took the kids to Magic Mountain.
the kids didn't even really want to go. The dads whined.
well, they're so spoiled, those dads.
so how was your day today? At the dog park?
how did you know about that? - Who do you think you're dealing with?
you're good. I have to give you that. - So come on.
tell me. - Okay.
we got off to kind of a rough start. But then it was okay, you know?
he was a little intense. He was nervous. He couldn't stop insulting me.
you know what this sounds like.
no, it's not. Don't say it. - But it is. It's a growth opportunity.
I'm not over my last growth opportunity when you stole Danny Shea.
will you forget Danny Shea? He's probably a convicted felon...
...By now, divorced.
maybe you should call him. - Carol.
what about that guy you met at preschool? You maimed his kid?
Bob Connor. - Yeah. Mr. Incorrigible.
I told you, I can't. He's the father of one of my students.
Yes, honey, but he's not your father. That's a big step forward for you.
bill. - Dolly.
Hey!
what a lovely home you have, Dolly. - Thank you.
when my third husband died, I decided to give up the big house.
third out of how many?
and these potholders?
where did you manage to find them?
why, everything in this house is handmade by Dolly.
Oh, yes. She's very creative.
our mother used to sew all our clothes when we were younger.
Sarah. - Well, she did.
your father told me all about your mother, honey.
she must have been a very special lady.
she was. - And you must miss her very much.
I do. - And you see me...
...as something of an interloper, I suppose.
do you want me to lie down for this?
we're at interloping? When did that happen?
it's Dad's life. I don't meddle.
Carol, you meddle in my life all the time.
well, technically that's not true, because you don't have a life.
I happen to have a very full life.
did you even check all of your messages?
I thought a few were very promising.
like who? - Like the engineer from Oxnard.
with the sexual dysfunction. - In what way would he be promising?
you could cure him. The whole nurse-patient thing.
you've got it all worked out. - It was brave of him to be so forthcoming.
why don't you call him, then. - Why don't you.
call! I'll give you his number. - Maybe I will.
go for it. - Okay.
hey there. Ms. Nolan.
what are you doing yelling in whispering Breeze Park?
look who it is.
what a surprise. - Oh, hi, Ms. Nolan. How are you?
Hi, sweetie. - Who's that?
Oh, this is my sister carol. - Nice to meet you.
this is Austin, my student, and his dad, Mr. Connor. Bob.
actually, I go by Bobby now.
right. You live here?
Yeah, they cater to the recently separated and divorced.
but I'm the youngest guy here by 40 years, so it's good for my morale.
my wife and I are gonna try it apart. - I know.
will you just look at her, son?
is my little girl lovely or is my little girl lovely?
Oh, Dad, don't worry about embarrassing me.
stop it, Bill. She is cute as a button, though.
so, what is it you do, Bobby? Sarah never tells us about her beaus.
I'm finishing my Ph. D. In American history.
a biography of Robert E. Lee. - I always felt sorry for Lee.
forced to fight against his old friends and west Point classmates.
could only dress in gray. Sad.
she's funny too. A complete package, you know.
when I need extra money, I work construction.
well, it sounds very manly. Do you wear a hardhat?
Sarah was the one who always had the boys knocking at the door.
Oh, Dad. - She had eyes only for that singer.
what was his name? Thin fellow.
looked like a girl. - Mick Jagger.
no, no. Sarah was saving herself for David cassidy.
like you weren't.
Carol wasn't saving herself for anybody. - What?
I remember now. It was David Cassidy of The Pheasant Family.
bill. Bill, honey.
partridge Family. You know, I saw him last year in Vegas.
he was good. Hadn't changed a bit. Same turtleneck.
Sarah had the whole Partridge act down.
she'd put on the little miniskirt, the go-go boots...
...and pretend she was Susan Dey.
this is all a lie. - Sing the theme song, Sarah.
don't make me kill you, Carol. - You remember the intro.
no. - Come on.
come on.
Oh, that was what he told you.
it was a great night. - Great night.
I forgot how much fun those humiliating family sing-alongs can be.
can I say one thing about Mr. Incorrigible?
only if you sing it. - He is hot. And he likes you.
I can't. It's just my luck. He's the father of one of my students.
he has a Ph. D. And a great ass. Let's not get dragged down by ethics.
technically, he doesn't have his Ph. D. Yet.
but yes, the ass thing, I know. - God, let's not even mention the eyes.
the crinkly smile. - No. That would be wrong.
so can I ask you a question? - No.
you never would have left Kevin. Would you?
if he hadn't left me? No, I don't think so.
but you weren't really happy.
well, I figured that was the life I picked, so I had to make the most of it.
I'm not even sure I deserve a new life now.
sometimes I think that was supposed to be my one chance and I blew it.
where did we get these bad attitudes, you think?
the nuns? - Yeah, that works.
let's blame the nuns. Can I say one more thing?
you love me. I know.
I do.
I mean, I was really bad. She did not see my A game.
sounds like she didn't see your B or c game.
I'm gonna call her again. I want to ask her out. I need a mulligan.
dog threw me. I mean, the sun was in my eyes.
pick someone else, start over.
no, this girl, there's something special about this girl.
you know the expression "she took my breath away"?
I mean, she did. I actually gasped. I'm off the bench, man.
think she'll see you again? I wouldn't.
you're not nice. Like, you're not a nice person.
Hi, June. - Hey, June.
Hi, June. - Hey, June.
need more cupcakes. All the dads are staying for the party.
what's up with that? - I have no idea.
every Halloween it's the same thing.
but I guess it's great how involved they are in their kids' world. Isn't it?
Yeah. - Yeah.
why don't you and Eric come over.
I'll rent a hopelessly romantic movie. We can all hold hands together and cry.
sounds fun, but we can't.
it's our anniversary, and we always spend it just the two of us.
sweet.
seven years ago tonight, we met at my parents' house.
they were trying to fix Eric up with my sister.
sorry we're late.
Austin drives so slow.
I hope my family wasn't embarrassing last night.
Oh, no. Not at all. They do seem a little bit involved in your life.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Austin's mom's from a large family.
that's a lot of people that don't speak to me.
thimbleful of juice? - Sure. But just one.
to good teachers. - To good dads.
to good teachers who are also very beautiful.
to good dads who are dangerously cute and charming.
there you go.
there's an attraction here, Sarah. You can't deny it.
I'm not. I'm trying to ignore it. - Why?
well, for one, Austin is my student.
two, we're in the puppet closet.
couldn't we go out in the real world? - I'm not so good in the real world.
I was looking at the handbook, under "dating, parents and teachers.
nothing. There's nothing there. - Sarah.
we need the emergency pants. It's an emergency.
emergency pants. Come on, sweetie.
Hey, babe, my name is Ron.
mid-40s, handsome, totally toned, 5'7," 161 pounds...
...give or take a piece of pizza.
no, I'm not kidding. I'm totally toned. Call me, you won't be sorry.
Hi, Sarah, it's Lennie.
I had a wonderful time, and I'm...
I'll call back.
Hi, Sarah? It's Jake Anderson, the idiot from the dog park.
actually, that was all a test to see how you respond...
...to crazy people, and you passed.
so maybe we could see each other again.
what do you say? You want to give me another chance?
I had a couple of icebreakers.
I even had a few stories for you, anecdotes, but I forgot them all.
I think it might be that dress. - My sister Carol made me buy it.
I love Carol.
well, this is a very charming place. - Yeah.
good food? - No, not particularly.
but I like the ambiance.
I come here because I know the owners, the Parseghians, that couple over there.
see? They're waving. - They want us to join them.
a few years ago, in a moment of blazing clarity...
...I forswore ethnic folk dancing, so...
they'll come over and say hello and maybe... How are you? Hi!
how are you? - Hello.
nice, right?
Sarah, Mr. And Mrs. Parseghian. - Hello.
welcome, Sarah. - Thank you.
see you later. We'll drink.
Absolutely. - Okay.
you speak Armenian. - A little bit.
well, what did you say?
I asked him, "where is the youth hostel?" It's all I remember.
kind of a joke we have.
what is it that you do, exactly?
God, no wonder I live alone.
I build boats.
you know, these handcrafted wooden sculls...
...rowing. The racing ones. - Yeah. Really?
Yeah. Yep.
does anyone buy those? - Nope. Not yet.
everybody wants all these high-tech...
...fiberglass, you know, no turbulence.
Where's the fun in that ride? I don't know.
but they'll come around. - Don't count on me. I get seasick.
in the bathtub. - Really?
Yeah.
you know what? Can we just skip all the small talk?
what? - Can we skip the small talk? Just skip it?
you know, like, who are you? Who am I?
what are we doing here together?
I have this theory that when you first meet somebody...
...that's the time when you have to be totally honest...
...because you have nothing to lose.
5, 10 years down the road, gets a lot harder.
you can't say one day, "Happy anniversary, this is me.
it doesn't work that way. This is it.
we'll never see each other as clearly and as nakedly as we do in this moment.
right now. This instant. I'm really scaring you right now, aren't I?
just a little bit. Yeah.
but, you know, on the one hand...
...you're very charming and interesting and you have a lot of energy.
you know, on the other hand, a little bit scary.
okay.
here's my story. Here's what you need to know.
okay.
I'm just divorced, and I had my heart broken badly...
...By a woman that I really loved.
you know, but I think your heart grows back bigger.
you know? Once you've got the shit beat out of you.
and the universe lets your heart expand that way.
I think that's the function of all this pain and heartache that we all go through.
you gotta go through that to come out to a better place. And that's how I see it.
what about you? Why is a dazzling woman like you single?
you can do it. You can just tell the truth.
if you know the truth. What have we got to lose?
after the dinner we shake hands, "good night," never see each other again.
all right.
he stopped loving me.
I don't know what I did or what I didn't do.
he just stopped.
I don't think I've ever said that out loud before.
see, we just had an honest moment.
now we can sit back and enjoy our food...
...and get to know each other. I'm Jake.
condom? - You don't have one?
why would I have one? - For occasions like this.
there haven't been any occasions like this.
you didn't bring one? - I didn't want to jinx it.
this preschool of yours, it's traditional? Developmental?
montessori? - Yeah, yeah. All that. Drugstore!
there's a Rite Aid on 93rd. Hang a left.
should I take the freeway? - Please turn left!
is this the fastest you can go? - I could go faster, but we'd lift off.
you drive. - All right.
for big ones, you need five, six coats of varnish.
for the singles, it's a little bit different.
there's one right there. Jackpot!
they're out!
how can they be out? - I don't know.
but I have a theory.
everybody in the whole city is having sex...
...at the exact same moment except us.
but we will press on.
what's wrong?
well, the magic is gone a little.
okay.
I mean, l... - No, no, I understand totally.
look, you know. There's other things we can do.
I'd be happy just to stay with you and look at you all night.
Yeah, I haven't done this in a while. And...
and now you don't want to. - Yeah.
Yeah. - Yeah.
that's all right. If the magic's gone, that implies there was once magic.
not bad for a first date.
second date. - Second date. This is great.
I had a great time. - Me too.
so...
...Good night.
you still have to drive me home, though. - Right. Because you don't live here.
don't worry, it's just me. I'm in the kitchen. Filled your freezer again.
there's now enough meat to feed every guy...
...who answered your ad and still...
Jake Anderson, my sister Carol. - Hi.
Hi. - Jake did, in fact, answer the ad.
do I get my meat?
thank you.
sorry to scare him away.
it's okay. I think we both realized it wasn't going to happen tonight.
what's the matter? He's so cute.
I don't know. We had a great night. Laughing, really talking.
you had a guy talking and you let him escape?
I'm not sure I actually understood a lot of what he said.
doesn't matter. He spoke.
and are we talking full sentences here or just grunting?
he's quite emotional. I know more about him than Kevin.
an emotional man who likes to talk.
this is a mythical figure, Sarah. - I don't think I'm ready for him.
he's looking for the whole dance and I'm just relearning the steps.
what happened exactly? Come on, tell me.
leave nothing out. - Okay.
we really connected at the restaurant, like I said.
but then, where do you go from there? How much baba ganoush can you have?
then we started making out, which was like being in 11th grade.
then neither one of us had a condom, which I think reflects some ambivalence.
I'm just not cut out for this. Life in the fast lane.
fast lane? You're not even on the on-ramp.
but these people seem happy. - Of course they do. They have a condom.
marc and I couldn't find a condom once. Wanna know what we used?
no. - Saran wrap.
thanks for that image which will stay in my brain for the rest of my life.
it was sexy in a Good Housekeeping kind of way.
I'll never be able to wrap leftovers again.
did it work? - Maeve was born nine months...
...and one day later.
I don't wanna just do random dating, Carol. I wanna be in love.
I wanna wake up next to someone and see them smile.
do the whole Sunday breakfast thing, go out and get the paper.
stay in bed together all day.
wouldn't we all?
man, this is absolutely gorgeous. I love this. I can't believe you built it yourself.
Yeah, handcrafted. Hand-carved.
I hope you'll find that it's more than a boat.
it's a time machine.
I love it. I want it. I'll take it. - Great.
did you race a lot in college?
I don't plan to race it. Could you cut it in half for me?
excuse me? - Yeah, cut it in half lengthwise.
I think it would be easier to mount on the wall that way.
you want to mount the boat?
Yeah. I thought I'd put it in the den. It'd look great above my big screen.
you know, I think maybe you should go to IKEA and buy a canoe.
it's not for sale in that way.
he's kidding, right? - Wouldn't that be nice.
I've had this dream that it'll end up wet.
it's just not for sale in that way at this time. Ever, really.
okay. Well, if you change your mind, I really do want it.
Yeah, if I change my personality, I'll let you know what I become.
okay. - Thanks so much.
nice guy. - Stanley owes me a big favor.
it was a guaranteed sale. - So what?
right. You can afford to be picky. You sold...
...let's see, no boats. No boats at all.
you worry too much. You really do.
you're in a good mood. That must have been some date.
Charlie, you should have seen this girl.
she's shy, she's fragile, she's self-conscious.
she has no idea how beautiful she is. She's a mess. It's fantastic.
the evening didn't end up great, but there were moments in there...
...where we were completely and utterly ourselves.
I was completely psychotic, but she was completely lovely.
are you thinking about completely closing the sale any time soon?
I tell you about a night with an unusual woman...
...and you turn it into a business transaction.
we're not selling real estate here.
and if we were selling real estate? - We'd be in escrow this weekend.
I see Dad's not alone.
never. Not our dad.
I'm not calling any of them Mom, I'll tell you that.
what is the new one's name again? - I believe that is Marlene.
there's a Linda, but I don't think that's her.
that's Dorothy. - Well, who knew.
hi there.
aunt Eileen.
you look wonderful. - Thank you, dear.
you look fine too, considering.
we never liked Kevin. We couldn't say anything, but we knew.
that's so sweet. - I hear you're not seeing anyone.
is that wise? With the clock ticking? Because I have someone special for you.
Casey Donovan. Handsome, smart, single.
aunt Eileen. - Yes?
he's my first cousin.
this is a fine day for the Nolan family, I tell you.
for my son, Bill Jr.
and young Ryan here, the confirmation boy.
and old Bill here.
I'd like to do a poem, if I may.
to commemorate the occasion.
who do you think he'll go with?
Tennyson. - Browning.
Yeats. - "Brown Penny.
by William Butler Yeats.
who knows her daddy?
I whispered, "I am too young
and then, "I am old enough
wherefore I threw a penny To find out if I might love.
go and love, go and love, young man, If the lady be young and fair.
Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny
I am looped in the loops of her hair.
o love is the crooked thing
there is nobody wise enough
to find out all that is in it
for he would be thinking of love Till the stars had run away
and the shadows eaten the moon.
Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny
one cannot begin it too soon.
so good to see you, Aunt Eileen. - It's always a pleasure.
mother Teresa! - Mother Teresa. No. Stop. Michael!
it's okay. I don't mind.
she doesn't mind. - That's not the point.
she actually likes dogs. And me. She just forgets.
Bye. - Sarah. Darling.
some pressing business has come up...
...and I was hoping you'd ferry Dolly home for me.
okay. Sure, Dad. - I don't mind staying.
you're a sweetheart. Both of you.
so, what do you think of my competition?
I don't really wanna discuss my father's...
Oh, it's okay. It's okay. I know. A woman always knows.
not always.
your guy go younger? - Yeah.
they always go younger, don't they?
it does seem to trend that way, doesn't it?
when they're 80, they want 60. When they're 60, they want 40.
when they're 80, they want 40. And they get it.
goddamn supply and demand.
we ought to kill the guy who thought that one up.
so you didn't see it coming, huh? - No, I thought we were happy.
maybe not "happy" happy, but, you know, satisfied.
I thought we were happy three times.
got a live one.
you gotta come take a look at this.
I love this Internet. It's part fantasy, part community.
and you get to pay your bills naked.
they don't stress that enough as a selling point.
it's Jeremy in San Diego.
he thinks I'm 16. He inverted the numbers in my age.
I didn't have the heart to tell him. - That would've been cruel.
he comes to me for advice. He thinks I'm very mature.
we're pinned.
you're on this, aren't you? - PerfectMatch. Com.
what, just one site? - Yeah.
honey, you gotta put more bets on the table.
I'm on at least 10. You get to try out different personalities.
like here. I say:
I'm into opera, antiques, poetry in the original Greek.
and on this one:
I like to skydive, ride motorcycles and enjoy rodeo.
but you don't do any of those things.
it's an ad. It's like those cars that say they get 30 miles to the gallon.
I mean, who knows.
you just want someone to take you out for a test drive.
I'm not comfortable advertising myself this way.
honey, when you get to be my age and approaching your expiration date...
...it pays to advertise. This baby never sleeps.
it's working for me 24 hours a day, God bless its little Pentium-chip heart.
so tell me about your ex.
Kevin. He's a fireman.
and cute. Very, very cute.
I have the calendars.
we met when I was dating all my brothers' friends.
my first two husbands were friends of my brother Dave.
both of them bastards. But then, so was my brother Dave.
things seemed to be going according to plan with me and Kevin.
we had our work, we got a house, then it was time to have kids.
but he was never ready.
I was 34. Then 35, then 36.
then instead of children, Kevin decided to have Veronica. Ronnie.
chatty as hell and 15 years younger.
they got married two months ago.
did I mention that she's pregnant?
go get it.
Hey.
what are you doing in the real world? - Dogsitting. My brother and his wife...
...are at marriage counseling. They don't want her to know they're having trouble.
you're a dog guy.
you kidding me? I'm half Labrador. Throw that ball. See who gets it.
I found him. I found the one I want! - Austin.
I found my puppy! - You did?
I'm getting a puppy! - You are? That's amazing!
it's so exciting! - I'm so happy for you.
let's go get him! - We'll be right behind you, Bubba.
thought it'd be good for him. - Great idea. Yeah.
I was gonna ask you if you thought he was too young.
but it's a good age, right? - I think so. Yes.
a boy needs a dog, right? - Absolutely.
who else is gonna eat his vegetables for him?
I can't tell you what it means to me that Austin's so happy in school.
he's just lucky to have you in his life.
we both are.
I found him, Dad. I found my puppy. Come on in, he wants to kiss you!
Oh, I think you're gonna need a bigger trailer.
Hello? - So I know our dates aren't beginning...
...or ending well, but I find the middle intriguing.
well, it's not dull, is it? - That's a good thing, right?
so, what do you say? You want to get together?
you really want to give it one more shot with me? Why?
are you kidding me? You're this whole new style, this whole new system.
vivid grammar of eroticism.
a completely unique constellation of attributes. My Halley's comet.
do you write this stuff down?
no, that actually came out of my head.
sometimes I use notes.
hold on. Someone's at the door.
Dolly, what a surprise. - I'm in trouble, Sarah. I need help.
Hello? Sarah, is everything okay? Sarah.
she can't talk now. It's an emergency.
it's Jeremy from San Diego. He's here.
I don't see why this is a problem. - Well, for one thing, you are 17, and she's...
forty-one. - Yeah, but those are just numbers.
look at Justin Timberlake and Cameron Diaz.
she's gotta be what, 100?
Oh, come on, Jeremy, be nice. She's probably the same age as me.
some people go their whole lives looking for their soul mate.
and I found mine when I was 15. Sue me.
Fifteen? You said you were 17.
dude, it is so not cool to lie to me. - I'm sorry.
I didn't think you'd take me seriously if you thought I was a kid.
of course I take you seriously.
you're a wonderful boy, honey. And we can always be friends.
but just friends. You know that.
okay. - And there's something else.
I'm not really 41.
I'm 43.
do your homework.
I couldn't bring myself to go over 50. It wouldn't have been fair to him.
good night. - Night.
thank you, Sarah. - Anytime.
Sarah. Hi.
I was in the trailer-hood. I thought I might stop by.
Oh, good.
Sarah? Is that you?
Sarah! Hi! - June?
I didn't know you were... - No. This is good. We're all here.
we can have a conference.
Oh, I'll just go home now and go to bed and maybe stay there forever.
Sarah has a friend who lives practically next door.
that's cool. I love weird, huge coincidences.
Yeah. - Sure you don't want to come in?
we opened a bottle of wine.
Oh, I think I'd rather die, but thank you. Yeah.
Hi. - Hey. Jennifer kicked us out.
both of us. - Oh, Mikey.
God, I'm so sorry.
she'll come around. - I told him it's the holidays.
people are under a lot of stress.
I love this guy. I do. I love him.
I love him. - We've been talking.
we've been here a while.
you all right? - Yeah.
let's go. - Come on, Mother Teresa.
I hope it's okay that I stopped by. - Oh, yes. Of course it is.
I'm so glad you did.
we were talking on the phone, everything was going well...
...and then some strange woman said "emergency" and hung up.
I called and no one answered, so I was a little worried.
I think it's very sweet, Jake. - It's just a false alarm?
definitely a false alarm. - Good.
no, my father's friend, she got into a little bit of trouble...
...and I had to help her out, and so I went over there for a while.
and after that I just drove around a while.
alone. I was alone. And...
Yeah, alone by yourself, sure. - Yeah.
well, anyway, the reason I stopped by...
...was I wanted to invite you out on my boat.
I don't think that's such a good idea. - Yes, it is.
no, because I...
boats are still on the water, right?
I hope so, otherwise I wasted a lot of time designing the hull.
Yeah, actually, they're aquatic.
well, I don't even know how to row. - I'll teach you.
I'd love to teach you how to row. - Okay. How?
we'll have a lesson right now. Okay? - Okay.
so the thing about rowing is just you gotta relax, first of all.
and then it's all about rhythm, balance...
rhythm and balance. ...and timing.
watch those oars, pal. - Okay.
and rhythm and timing, see? - Balance and rhythm.
see, it's not that bad, is it? - No, I like rowing.
then you want to make sure you get, you know, your hair out of the way.
that's gotta hurt.
Michael? - You okay, pal?
Oh, no. Don't stop what you're doing. I was on my way out.
easy there, Tex.
where are you going? - Oh, I just spoke to Jennifer.
everything's great. I got the couch, the dog's gonna stay.
you should stay here too. You shouldn't be driving.
I'll drive him home. Okay? - Yeah.
I thought we were gonna, you know, row the boat.
we will. Just stay exactly here and stay exactly you...
...and I'll be back in about 15 to 20 seconds depending on traffic.
just hold that thought. Where do you live?
of course you realize when Jake gets here, you'll have to excuse yourself.
Bob! Bobby. No, Bob.
you dropped these on my driveway. - Oh, thank you.
I'm really sorry. I'm sure that seemed pretty awkward, huh?
no, no. Routine, really.
there's nothing going on there with me and June.
they were late from the museum, and I made her stay for dinner.
well, thank you for bringing these...
you're back. - Yeah, he... He passed out.
he couldn't tell me where he lived.
321 something. - Yeah, that was all I got.
I'm Bob, by the way. - Oh, my manners have completely left me.
I'm so sorry. Jake Anderson. - How you doing?
my brother Michael. - Oh, sorry. Here you go.
pleasure to meet you.
this is Bob Connor, parent at the school.
we were just... what were we?
Sarah left stuff at my place tonight, thought it'd be better to get it back.
I'll get out of the way.
talk to you tomorrow, Sarah. Okay? - Okay.
nice to meet you guys. - Pleasure.
Hey, I better get going. Where do you want me to put him?
maybe I'll put him here. - No, you don't...
we're sitting down now, Buddy.
Yeah, I...
I better get going. - You don't have to go. You could stay. Sit.
no, no, no. Really, I should go.
Jake. Jake, please let me explain.
you don't have to. - I want to.
I don't have any claim on you.
we've seen each other what, four times now? I realize that.
you won't let me explain?
let me do it. You were lying because you didn't want to hurt my feelings. I get it.
if dogs are to prove their worth as rescuers...
...they must overcome their fears. Again, Mass goes first.
she's accustomed to the deafening noise and turbulent winds of the helicopter.
she's made these jumps dozens of times before.
but the big question is, how will the rookies perform?
you could do this. You could.
they hesitate at the open door.
Hey, I'm gonna head out.
you forgot to take your headdress off. - No, I didn't. Any plans for the holiday?
dad's house, a thousand relatives. How about you?
Eric's parents are back in town. - Now they're starting to piss me off.
Oh, honey, if you need to cry, call me. - Got you on speed dial.
are we okay?
sure. Why wouldn't we be?
I had no idea you and Bobby were...
Oh, we're nothing, June. Me and Bobby.
well, we're not either. Me and him.
but he is one hot dad, though. I so don't blame you for being interested.
interested" may be pushing it.
well, I'm not in that picture. I just want you to know.
I love Thanksgiving. I'm so glad I'm not cooking.
watch your back.
now, before we tackle this succulent-looking bird...
...we have some honored guests with us today.
Marlene Swift. Dorothy Murphy.
and Dolly McCann.
Hello, Dolly.
Hi. - Hey.
all three at the same table.
the man has balls of steel.
we're very proud.
this was a great idea. It's the perfect place to spend Thanksgiving.
I'm just sorry my parents aren't here. - Next year.
you're not afraid that'd be too sentimental?
no. It's old family tradition.
they have a great Sunday brunch here too. - Did I tell you she was a teacher?
preschool. Works with kids.
tiny, tiny little kids. You want kids? - Oh, yeah. I love kids.
want that white picket fence, the whole deal.
she might've been the one. She's good. She was interesting.
I caught a glimpse. Something.
you gotta stop obsessing about the dog-park girl, Jake.
I know. - Move on.
I will.
this time you got written out of Act 1. women are devious.
self-serving, shallow.
not you, dear.
okay. If Casey Donovan's no good...
lf"? What do you mean, "if"? His mother and my mother were sisters.
Ron Detmer? - He's my optometrist.
he's expecting your call.
how many fingers am I holding up?
Sarah, great news. I didn't want to get your hopes up.
but two guys in my office just got divorced.
so much to be thankful for. - Start with Richie.
if that doesn't work, go with Jerry.
Richie first. Got it. - Yeah, definitely go with Richie.
better watch yourself. With those girls, cleaning is a contact sport.
he's worth it, you know, your dad. Despite all his shenanigans.
besides, I'm having as much fun as he is.
why don't I believe you?
look, you care about someone, they're in a lot of pain, you cut them some slack.
I just thank God he doesn't have a bigger table.
one raised eyebrow. Never a good sign.
how do you remember all their names, Dad?
let alone birthdays and religious affiliations?
I have it all on a disk. That way... - I really don't want to know.
you're in different leagues, Dad. You and Dolly.
I think she's starting to fall for you.
well, I'm sorry if... - No, you're not.
because being a man today means never having to say you're sorry.
I resent how easy this all is for you.
you've got women coming and going, cooking, cleaning.
they're probably tuning up your car for all I know.
all that matters to you guys is the tushies are tight and the bellies are flat.
meanwhile, caring, interesting, compassionate women...
...of a certain age sit home alone...
...reading Jane Austen, eating ice cream, which makes them less likely to find...
are we still talking about me? Because I can't tell anymore.
no, I'm sorry, Dad. I can't either.
it's all right.
I just don't want to see Dolly get hurt.
I don't either.
but it's different for me.
I've had the love of my life.
and no one else could ever touch that.
no one can come close.
so I'm just out there...
...passing the time.
tap-dancing, if you want the truth.
maybe if I dance fast enough...
...I won't remember what I've lost.
you see?
I'll be right there.
Hi, can l...?
look who's here. It's you.
Yes, your worst nightmare.
the single-chicken-breast lady. - You wanna at least hear the specials?
I'm supposed to tell them to you, that's all.
just the chicken breast.
it's rough out there, huh? You wanna talk about it?
you know, you're not a bartender.
have you tried the Internet? I mean, it really works.
you know, I met my wife online, and she... - chicken. Now.
why not?
and I've been to Italy a lot too. I just got back from Rome...
...where I took this fabulous in-depth tour called "As the Romans Do.
the guide was incredible. - I took that tour. Big fat guy, right?
before that, Switzerland. I got caught in a storm.
I almost died in a blizzard once. - I lived up in the Alps for a year.
they had to cut me out of the snow with scissors.
my aunt had a farm. In the morning, we'd warm ourselves with the coals of the fire.
I learned to make goat cheese. It was very Heidi.
well, I just think it's wonderful how much you care about your children, Peter. Really.
it's not always the case. I'm a teacher, I know.
well, it's just my daughter. She's 14.
but she's everything to me.
were you surprised that I called? - Little bit.
but happy.
well, I figured what the hell.
it's time to take control of my life. New Sarah.
I liked the old Sarah, you know. - New and improved.
good morning. - Hi.
Hi.
what time is it? - It's a little after 9.
damn.
do you mind if we take that and go? I don't wanna run into traffic.
Oh, it's Sunday. - Yeah, I got a game today.
you gonna eat that? - No. Here.
thank you.
you did sleep with June, didn't you?
does it matter? Really?
it's just that you told me nothing happened.
I knew we'd be great together, I didn't want anything to get in the way of that.
and we were.
Yeah.
that was fun. Thanks a lot. I'll call you.
you mad at me? - No, I'm not mad at you.
good, I was afraid something had... - I'm mad at myself for trusting you.
for not listening to that voice that said:
he is a shallow, self-centered bastard." Which is what you are, you stupid head!
maybe I have been teaching preschool too long, but you took advantage of me.
you knew how vulnerable I was. I was the weak impala of the herd.
and you pounced on that with that whole sensitive dad-of-the-year act.
and, "we're adopting a puppy.
and the fake professor thing with these fake glasses.
these aren't even real, are they?
sorry.
I just hate guys like you. I hate guys like you!
but this is a good look for you, Sarah.
you've gone beyond pajamas and are now wearing the bed.
Oh, God. I just went after the wrong guy again. Like always.
I slept with a man who's not my husband.
I'm promiscuous.
we should redo your profile and put that in it.
Oh, God. I'm a complete and total love failure.
Oh, no. - Stop it, it's not that funny.
stop laughing.
what about that cute guy I met? Condom man.
Yes, that's how he likes to be known. - Condom man?
sounds like a superhero. - I can't.
he hates me. And I don't blame him.
no, I had my chance with him, and I blew it.
let's go watch Beaches.
Oh, my God.
when they remake this, they gotta add a happy ending and nudity.
they won't remake it. Nobody wants to watch this kind of yearning nowadays.
it's too painful.
modern man can't take it. - This has gotta end.
there's a world beyond Zhivago-land.
forget about the dog-park girl and live again.
you think your friend still wants to buy my boat?
let him chop it up, stick it on his wall.
call him. - Seriously?
tell him to come by the boat basin this weekend. I'll row it down myself.
and call some of those insane, pansexual girls you're so fond of.
I want a date every day until Christmas.
where have you been all my life? - Waiting for you.
you are absolutely perfect. You know that, don't you?
I do. But it's still nice to hear.
look at you, cute jammies.
already in them, a little early for that. Come on, have a seat.
Eric, come on.
all right. Now...
...Eric and I are here to cheer you up, and we have many options.
I'm ready.
first, there's line dancing at the Grove. Very Southwest, mid-'80s.
too gay. - Or...
...we can use these teacher gift certificates...
...for midnight manicures. - Perfect. Can we do that?
that's not too gay? - No.
he keeps the mystery alive, doesn't he?
what color?
white. Caucasian.
what color nail? After wax.
I don't know. What do you think? - Your nail, not mine.
the light pink one. Yeah.
not much love life, huh?
not getting younger.
did you hear that?
what is that? Why do I always get the surly manicurist?
I don't know. Does a good job, right?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I'll be right back.
Jake!
Jake! - Sarah.
Jake! Hi. - Hi.
this is so weird, because I've been thinking about you so much.
nice to see you. Oh, you're all... You look like...
I keep thinking about you.
what do they call those? Pot sticker, with the potholders.
Hi. I'm ready, Jake. Sorry I took so long.
Hi. I'm Sherry.
Hi. - This is Sarah.
we just saw Doctor Zhivago at the Grand. - Yeah.
doctor Zhivago. - It's Jake's favorite movie.
I didn't get it. - Oh, I've seen it like 20 times.
Really? - Really?
Yeah. - Why? It's so depressing.
everybody's freezing their asses off.
they're communists, right? - Yeah.
I guess I keep hoping that one time, Lara and Yuri will get together again.
in the springtime, preferably. And wear shorts.
okay, but they can't, because it's just a movie.
it's a book too. - Yeah, that's cruel.
Yeah.
anyway...
thanks for bringing that up.
okay, I have to go get de-waxed.
Sarah, it was really nice seeing you again.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
not again.
Yes. Thank...
Yeah. Bye.
do you want to be Russians tonight? - Let's go.
well, Sherry, I think I'm gonna say good night.
you're not coming in? - No, I'm kind of tired.
I'm gonna go home. - Aren't we gonna do the Russian thing?
that's Russian for "no.
was it something that I did...? - No, no, no. I'm just really tired.
tired. Yeah, it was a long movie. - Really long.
Bye.
it seemed like it was gonna be so perfect.
you chase him down the street, he turns, he sees you...
...he takes you in his arms, fireworks explode.
it's happily ever after.
you're leaving out the part where he was with another woman.
I say you call him.
or better yet, go over there, break into his house, throw yourself at him...
...make a complete fool of yourself. It worked for me.
it was very effective. - No, he's with someone else.
I have to face it, it's just not gonna work out with us.
and you'd really like it to, wouldn't you?
I can't take this. This is breaking my heart.
mine too. But let's look on the bright side.
your nails look fabulous. - They do.
they look so good. Let me see those.
look at these hands. - Thank you, guys.
turn around, this is your favorite part.
she's wearing that hat you like.
that's my side, thank you very much.
mother Teresa.
I love you too.
you like her?
she's a handsome boat. - Yeah.
reminds one of the longboats they would run...
...out of the sweet harbor at Bantry Bay.
actually, I designed this one based on a Portuguese boat.
but historically, you're correct, yeah.
you built this boat yourself? - Yes, sir.
you build boats? - No, no.
truth be told, I don't know the first thing about them.
but I do appreciate a work of art. - Well, thank you, sir.
I'm about to sell this work of art to a guy who's gonna cut it in half...
...and stick it on his wall. - Oh, no.
Yeah. I'm about to take her out for a last paddle before I meet the butcher at noon.
why would you do a thing like that?
it's a long story. Something about the violation of expectations...
...and a crushing loss of faith in love and life and art.
so it's a girl. - Yes.
I've had a little girl trouble myself lately.
but better to have loved and lost. Am I right?
she was a unique constellation of attributes.
she was my Halley's comet.
but... Universe is designed to break your heart, yes?
a philosopher as well as an artist. Yes, it's we who suffer most.
Yes. With the possible exception being the victims of violent crime.
well, it's been a pleasure to meet you, sir. - No, no, pleasure's all mine. Jake.
bill. I have a daughter who would... - No, no.
never mind. No, no. Sorry.
well, this is a surprise.
can't a father pay a visit to his daughter on a beautiful Sunday morning?
Carol called you, didn't she? She's afraid I'm getting into my pajamas again.
actually, Carol called Christine, Christine called Michael...
...Michael called me. - Any word from Aunt Eileen?
she said to tell you that Casey Donovan was adopted.
if that helps.
well, at this point, he's starting to look awfully good.
he's out there, Sarah.
someone who would appreciate all you have to offer.
after all, you're this unique constellation of attributes.
you're Halley's comet... - what did you just say?
it's a nice turn of phrase, but it's not my own.
I heard it from a young man I met this morning.
builds beautiful Irish boats.
poor lad. Had his heart broken by a woman he deeply cared about.
deeply.
Jake. Jake! - Hello there.
Hi. Hi, I'm looking for Jake. Jake Anderson. Is he here?
no, he isn't. But lucky for us, I am. - I don't have time for this.
do you know where he is? - You're "must love dogs," aren't you?
you've already crushed him, he's been moping for weeks.
he's even given up the whole wooden-boat thing.
you've done enough. - That's all wrong.
I have to talk to him. Where is he?
I can't tell you that. - Where is he?
I'm not telling you.
you know the bridge by the boat ramp?
Jake?
Jake.
Jake!
I'd like to rent a boat, please. - I'm sorry, we're all out of boats.
all right, come on. - Oh, a love chase.
come on, girl, you can do this.
this is really important to me. Come on.
I think he could be the one.
come on, girls, let's get going.
push! Push!
push! Push!
push, push!
push! Push! Push!
push! - Push!
that's him. I see him!
Jake! Jake!
stop the boat!
never mind.
okay, girl, here we go.
Jake!
here she goes!
Jake.
what are you doing?
all right. Here we go. All the way up. Almost.
come on, girl. - Come on.
good girl, you can do it. - Here we go.
watch your paws there. - Easy, easy.
cold. Cold. Very cold.
here we go.
thank you.
was there something you wanted to say to me?
Yes.
could have just called.
perhaps that would have been the wiser course, yes.
what's up?
I owe you my story. You asked me for honesty...
...and it scared the hell out of me, and I held back...
...and I didn't want to let you see the real me.
because I was afraid of getting hurt again.
but, listen, I hear that the universe lets your heart expand...
...and grow back even bigger after you go through all that pain.
well, I believe that now.
and I was just wishing there was a way that...
...I could have another chance to make this work.
I'll be right with you.
Hi, how can l...?
don't worry, I got it.
single chicken breast, no dating advice, coming right up.
actually, I would like to have three whole fryers, please.
and six pork chops and a lamb shank.
and do you have any dog bones back there?
if you do, throw them in the cart. What are the specials today?
Yes.
thank you.
how many people are actually in this family?
Hey. - Hey.
get down.
down!
how did we meet?
Oh, that's a great story. Tell it, hon. - Great story.
well, actually, it's a very romantic story.
you tell it, Carol. - No, go ahead, honey.
no, no, really, you should. She tells this story great.
you don't remember, do you?
don't remember? How we met?
I don't remember.
but I love her.
I love her!
love is not reserved for the young, you know.
as the poet said:
grow old along with me! The best is yet to be - Yeats? - No.
Tennyson? - No.
browning. - Browning.
who knows her daddy?
Oh, my gosh, I did not think I was ready to settle down...
...but look at the size of this rock.
and you want to know what else? I'm gonna get a cute little tattoo...
...in someplace that's N-o-N of your business.
and wanna know what it's gonna say?
Mrs. Casey Donovan.
the best place to meet someone...
...is Parseghian's Armenian restaurant in Koreatown.
I don't care if you're young, you're old...
...you're single, you're divorced...
I'm getting there.
7100 First Street.
wednesday, mother-in-law night.
all she can eat.
in a dog park. - Dog park, yeah.
it's true. - I know.
I was very... I was nervous.
we had no idea at the time that we could ever wind up...
Oh, that's not true. I did.
you did not. - I did too.
I have a theory about this. - He has lots of theories.
I do. This is actually a good one. I took some notes.
Oh, God, you're so prepared for this.
you grow up, you're an adult, right?
and you think you have all this worldly experience, right? That's point A.
you think your personality is formed.
and then you think you're complete...
...but you meet somebody, you start feeling new things.
and you start feeling excruciatingly painful things.
you get confused, right? You get nauseous.
and I think when you get really nauseous, like that, it's, like, the completion of self.
the person who can fill the final void.
fuck.
fucking fuck!
watch it, old man.
what the fuck? You're doing it wrong!
man: Needle is doing what the needle does.
what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
the irezumi does not hide the skin.
the tattoo reveals the nature of the man...
... and illuminates the four noble professions in The Book of Five Rings:
the warrior, the artist, the merchant and the farmer.
if there is a conflict between the needle and the skin... between the mark and the man...
... then perhaps the path you've chosen is not the path for which you're suited.
what did you just say, old man?
huh?
I know you didn't just disrespect me, did you?
you that fucking stupid?
you disrespect me and I'll tattoo the ceiling with your fucking brains.
no disrespect.
you're lucky.
I can't kill you until you finish this thing. Bang.
give me that mirror.
let's see how it's looking.
not bad, not bad.
YAKUZA: Hey, boss. This just came for you.
what is it? - A letter.
so open it, dumbass.
what?
what is it? YAKUZA: It looks like sand.
Yep. Sand.
black sand. - No.
you know what this is?
you wanna let us in on the joke?
years ago I watched a man open an envelope like that one.
there were many with him.
and they laughed as you laugh now.
and then it came from the shadows...
... and their laughter was drowned in blood.
what came out of the shadows?
I cannot say the word.
what word?
that night...
... one of their blades struck here.
I should have died but for an accident of birth.
my heart is here, on the other side.
the fuck is that?
it looks like a ninja, boss.
a ninja?
are you kidding me? That's the word you're afraid to say? Ninja?
ninja, ninja, ninja. Yeah, you old fuck.
Yeah, you had me going.
ninja. That's some good shit. YAKUZA: Ninja.
wanna fuck with me, huh?
wanna fuck with me?
look, you don't have to do this.
whatever they're paying you, I'll double it.
I'll triple it.
you hear me?
I'll pay you whatever you want.
you cannot bargain with it, you cannot reason with it...
... because it is not a human being.
it is a demon sent straight from hell.
you shut your face, old man!
I'll blow your fuck...
man: For 57 years, I've told your story.
no one ever believed me, but you are real, aren't you?
ninja
is all that for the Delgata case?
this is Delgata.
and the rest? - Evidence.
for?
Oh, no, not again, Mika, please.
what is the problem? You've trusted my research before.
here's a question. Which of these does not belong in this sentence:
laptop, space shuttle, nanotechnology, ninja.
all I'm asking for is an hour. That's all.
why do I think I'm gonna regret this?
MIKA: Remember the Eulmi Incident?
korean queen, late 1800s, killed by one of these ninja clans.
Ozunu, I think.
now, I've been going through the original transcripts of the trial... of Kunitomo Shigeaki.
the prosecutor questioned Shigeaki about a payment of 100 pounds of gold.
Shigeaki answered that he didn't know what the prosecutor was talking about.
the question was never brought up again.
but what pinged for me was the amount.
the exact same amount rumored to have been paid to the Ozunu Clan...
... for the Yakuza massacre that happened last week in Osaka.
so you wonder, in this ever-changing world...
... if the cost of a man's life remains the same.
exactly. I mean, I figure these clans are like, what, a thousand years old?
they probably don't change.
so I started looking at international wire transfers...
... targeting banks in the regions of several high-profile assassinations.
and bingo. Russian Prime Minister Zhukov.
the day before the assassination...
... $ 1, 555, 999 and 90 cents...
... was transferred from the Bank of Shanghai.
that is the exact market equivalent of 100 pounds of gold.
okay, you got me, this is interesting. - The clans are real, Ryan.
they steal children and turn them into assassins.
look, Mika, no one's denying the historical facts...
... but this thing doesn't make sense in a modern world.
they're real. You can call them spooks or assassins or whatever you want...
... if it makes you feel better, but they are out there and they are killing people.
and nobody is doing a damn thing to stop them.
Hi. Excuse me.
would you mind?
if it's not too much trouble, could you help me with this?
what clan are you from?
what are you doing in Berlin?
I don't understand.
what is going on?
MIKA: You found something?
MASLOW: I was digging around trying to see what I could come up with and I found this.
a report. A friend of mine in Moscow tipped me to it.
it was written during the Cold War...
... by a high-ranking KGB agent named Alexi Sabatin.
he raises the possibility that a number of political assassinations...
... were conducted by an ancient but sophisticated network...
... he calls the Nine Clans.
mind you, he doesn't call them ninjas. - What happened to him?
same thing that's gonna happen to me if I hang around with you.
kicked out of the service for mental instability.
you believe it now, don't you?
ninjas.
you gotta be joking. - Well, then why are you doing all this?
I don't know.
but I can guarantee you it has nothing to do with the fact...
... that you're the most attractive researcher I have ever worked with.
Oh, Mr. Nan.
good, you are back.
we had a heating problem, and I had to go into your apartment.
is it all right? - It's all fixed.
you keep it very dark and spare in there.
and forgive me, but I couldn't help noticing your suitcases.
RAIZO: I told you, my father was a very sick man.
LANDLADY: Do you have to leave Berlin soon?
RAIZO: Not yet, but I am expecting a phone call.
LANDLADY: I'm sorry to hear that.
RAIZO: One day, death will come for us all.
OZUNU: Wherever you are...
... wherever you may go...
... you must never forget who you are...
... how you came to be.
you are Ozunu.
you are part of me...
... as I am part of you.
this is the truth of your lives...
... and it will remain true after death.
this is my new son.
I have given him the name Raizo.
welcome him as your brother.
all: Welcome, Raizo.
OZUNU: The body must obey the will.
hunger and thirst...
... even the blood in your veins, are the body's weakness.
master them...
... and you master the self.
this is the power of the Ozunu Clan.
this is the way of the ninja.
eat tonight and you work twice as hard tomorrow.
OZUNU: What is the lesson?
look at your brother.
life is combat.
you know this truth.
abandoned by your parents...
... without a home, without people to care for you...
...you should have died.
but instead you fought.
as you did here today, you fought and you won.
in combat, you face the enemy without doubt, without pity or remorse.
to survive, you must learn to fear nothing at all.
OZUNU: Pain breeds weakness.
remember, suffering exists...
... only because weakness exists.
you must hate all weakness.
hate it in others, but most of all, hate it in yourself.
MIKA: Mrs. Sabatin? - Yeah.
I'm Mika Coretti with Europol. We spoke on the phone.
you said you read my husband's report, yes?
Yes.
I understand the report caused some problems for him within the KGB.
the report caused problems for Alexi's career...
... the way Moses caused problems for the Pharaoh. Very unpleasant.
what happened?
about two years ago...
... after the assassination of Zhukov...
... the report drew attention.
after that...
... everything was different.
Alexi hired men to change all the locks and put in more of them.
locks on the windows, locks on the doors, locks on the locks.
he put in cameras and motion sensors...
... and lights. Everywhere, lights.
"there can be no shadows," he said.
no shadows.
then one day, a man came to the door.
they talked in Alexi's study for some time, and then...
... the young man left.
my husband was a soldier.
member of Russian intelligence.
he was not a man to frighten easily.
but when I came to the door, in his eyes I saw fear.
and then he stood up...
... he kissed me and told me that he loved me very much.
he said...
... I should always remember that.
do you know what they talked about?
no. He said it was safer that way.
can I ask how he died?
the lights went out.
you are the first person who has taken my husband's work seriously.
it would be good to know that he did not die without cause.
he would want you to have this.
MIKA: Who are you?
did Takeshi's blow hurt you?
you think this is pain.
you are mistaken.
that is true pain.
here is your test, Raizo.
survive the night.
very good, Raizo.
very good.
boy, you're like a dog with a bone on that computer, aren't you?
excuse me?
agent Zabranski...
... Internal Affairs.
need to ask you a couple of questions.
you're Mika Coretti, yeah? - Mm-hm.
forensic researcher.
you work a lot with Agent Maslow, that right?
a few cases, yeah.
you have something of a social relationship.
excuse me? - You had lunch with him on the 13th...
... and again on the 18th.
how do you know that?
isn't it true? - I'm not sure.
we do have lunch together sometimes, but that's usually when we're working.
has Agent Maslow seemed different to you lately in any way?
I mean, has he said or done anything that struck you as unusual?
no. Why?
has Agent Maslow done something?
just routine.
the agency cares about its field operatives.
we monitor for signs of stress, fatigue...
... mental exhaustion.
agent Maslow has a serious caseload.
that much work can wear on a man.
MIKA: Zabranski came to my office. MASLOW: Yeah, I got a surprise visit too.
MIKA: He made it real clear, Ryan. They're watching us.
I don't get the full picture quite yet, but I know a warning when I see one.
but why? - Why? It's obvious.
if this little fantasy of yours has any chance of being real...
... then these clans are gonna have some pretty major juice protecting them.
so, what are you gonna do?
we are gonna tiptoe very carefully from here on in, you understand?
you do nothing without checking with me first.
got it? - Got it.
ALEXl: A 14th-century scroll refers to one of the oldest of the Nine Clans...
... as the Clan of Black Sand.
the Islamic explorer Ibn Battuta journeyed with a group of orphans...
... that were being taken to a remote shido...
... hidden among snowcapped mountains.
Battuta describes a ceremonial dinner...
... followed by a display of martial skill.
the combatants were children, neither beyond the age of 10.
his hosts explained that a man's life must be made meaningless...
... compared to the life of the clan.
own the meaning of a man's life...
... and you own his heart.
you shouldn't do that. It's against the rules. If they catch you...
then they catch me. - They'll put you in the box.
I believe the heart of the tree knows which way it needs to grow.
trees don't have hearts. - Everything has a heart.
I don't.
Really?
let me see.
Hello?
it's saying hello back...
... and that it's happy to meet me, but it misses you.
liar. - I'm not lying.
listen to mine.
OZUNU: For an entire year, you shall live without one of your senses...
... beginning with the sense you rely on the most.
you must see with more than your eyes.
cut him, Kiriko.
all failure must be sown into the flesh.
cut him.
you know the law.
I told you.
I tried to warn you.
Yes.
you did.
why, Kiriko?
Why?
why am I in here...
... or why are you out there?
RAIZO: Kiriko!
why are you doing this?
I have to.
you know the law. He will cut your heart from your chest.
no.
he can never touch my heart.
come with me.
where? What is out there?
life.
my life is here.
MASLOW: Shh.
fucking Christ, Ryan.
I'm sorry I couldn't talk earlier, Mika. They're watching me. Get in.
where have you been? I've been calling your office.
now I know how Sabatin must have felt.
what's happened?
MASLOW: Right now I've got Internal Affairs, Homeland Security...
... the CIA and for all I know the Martian military in my office...
... tearing the place apart.
what are we gonna do?
you are gonna pack your bags, go on holiday.
no way.
don't argue. I trusted you, you gotta trust me.
I'm sorry, I can't let you lose your job because of me.
I'm not talking about losing my job. Take this.
it's clean, untraceable, no serial number.
Ryan? - Yeah, I know.
I've investigated world bank organizations, drug cartels, arms dealers.
I've never faced this kind of heat.
for ninjas. It's fucking unbelievable.
MIKA: Excuse me.
Hey. MAN: Hi.
so, what's going on?
power's out. Us, the building behind us, and that one across the street.
it seems like every few months, boom, the light's out.
okay.
Thanks.
RAIZO: More will come. - What?
they won't stop until you're dead.
MIKA: Oh, God.
RAIZO: A gun won't help you.
MIKA: Well, I don't have a lot of options, okay?
I once took a Tae Bo class...
... but that is the extent of my kung-fu abilities, all right?
I can help you, but you have to trust me.
MIKA: Okay.
do you know me?
how?
security camera in New York recorded you fighting one of them.
you know about them?
a little.
well, there are these clans.
and, apparently, they've been supplying assassins to governments...
... or anyone who has 100 pounds of gold...
... for the last thousand years.
RAIZO: His name was Jin.
wait, you knew him?
he was not born an assassin. - You're from his clan.
they why did you stop him? - They're coming.
who?
ninja 1 [WHISPERING]: It was him, the traitor, Raizo. Murderer.
fresh kill. NINJA 2: He's with the girl.
still close.
very close.
TAKESHl: Run, little brother, run.
OZUNU: Weakness compels strength.
betrayal begets blood.
this is the law of the Nine Clans.
OZUNU: We have been betrayed.
a child of mine, my daughter, betrayed us.
she refused my gifts, rejected our clan.
her shame can only be purged with blood.
you.
you, my son, who returned her shall have this honor.
where are we going? - Doesn't matter.
you think they're following us?
I know they're following us.
MIKA: I don't see anything back there.
they have our scent.
following our scent? Like dogs?
no. Like wolves.
my name's Mika, by the way.
Raizo is the name I was given.
so you're an orphan?
if it's okay with you, I'm gonna try and fill in some of the blanks here.
so you must have been taken by the Ozunu Clan, trained to be an assassin...
... but something happened and you decided to opt out of the program.
now, I don't imagine that went over so well.
since they're after me for just peeking through the keyhole...
... they must be after you in, like, a major way.
but you're also after them, which is why you're in Berlin.
because Sabatin is one of the few people pursuing the clans...
... which is why they took him out.
but here's a question I can't answer.
why did you save me?
OZUNU: Your entire life has brought you to this moment.
do not fail yourself.
do not fail your family.
he's wearing a gold watch.
bring it to me.
that kind of tickled.
it's gonna take more than a knitting needle to fuck me up, boy!
OZUNU: Keep it.
it will remind you that...
... every moment of your life is a gift I have given you.
you have made me proud, my son.
now the time has come for you to prove...
... you are true Ozunu.
she tried to run from us...
... from our family.
takeshi caught her and returned her to us.
weakness compels strength.
betrayal begets blood.
this is the law of the Nine Clans.
kill him!
you need protection.
no. I want Ozunu, and I need your help to get him.
exit here.
you are a size 36? - What?
no, size 34.
if you leave while I'm gone...
... they'll hunt you and kill you.
do you understand?
get undressed.
shower, but do not use soap. Do you smoke?
put your clothes in here.
these jeans are a little tight.
you said 34.
Yeah, well, it's German sizes. They must run a little small, I guess.
this is for our scent. Right?
let's go.
europol - Yeah? MIKA: Ryan, it's me.
Mika, I've been calling you for hours. - I know, I'm in a bit of trouble.
you miss jury service, you're in trouble.
you're in the deepest shit you've ever been in.
at least I'm not down here by myself.
Sabatin's guy from the tape? Is he with you?
he's on our side, Ryan.
he wants Ozunu, but he needs the agency's help.
be careful, Mika. - I trust him.
all right, look, I can't make any promises, but if he cooperates, I'll do what I can.
can you meet us? - Where?
how about the usual?
there he is.
now, it's all right. He's a good guy.
Mika, are you okay? - Yeah.
thanks to him.
why have you done this? - Done what?
people will die.
now! MIKA: No!
agent 1: Don't move!
MIKA: This is wrong! No! No!
agent 2: Charlie 2, do you read me?
agent 3: Move him!
what the fuck are you doing?
following orders.
prisoner is secure, sir. - Right.
agent 1: Sure doesn't look like a killing machine to me, sir.
looks like he belongs in a boy band.
he couldn't have heard that. Could he?
agent 2: Sir? - Ryan? This is wrong.
I mean, it can't be legal.
what is this place? Your own private Guantanamo?
it's an old GDR safe house. Jamison wants this off the grid.
you're making a huge mistake.
I don't think so.
I got reports from London, Washington and Osaka, all tagging your boy.
the only problem we have is where to extradite him first.
two weeks ago, there's no such thing as ninja...
... and now every city in the world has a warrant for one?
he is not the enemy. - He's a killer, Mika.
weren't you telling me it was our job to stop him?
you're not even listening. - You're not saying anything worth hearing.
wanna do the insubordination tango? Let's go. But not in front of the children.
MASLOW: Boys, get out.
come on, let's go!
damn it, I am just trying to...
shut up and listen to me. We don't have much time.
now I don't know what we've stumbled into...
... but somebody's pulling some major strings inside.
they want him dead. He's been fighting them for years.
I believe you.
I've been in this business too long not to smell a setup...
... but we have to be very careful how we handle this...
... and I cannot risk you going AWOL on me again.
now, if you get into trouble...
... you switch this on...
... and no matter where you are, I'll find you.
Hey.
you looked thirsty.
I'm sorry, I didn't know about any of this.
I know. - You do?
the only time you lied to me was when you told me your size.
how did you know that?
your heart. It is special.
[Whispering] Maslow's on our side. He's gonna try to help you.
[Whispers] It's too late.
MASLOW: No one goes here.
MIKA: Ryan? Ryan, can I talk to you?
do we have to do this again, Coretti?
I just...
I have reason to believe a group of ninja may be on their way.
I think these gentlemen can handle a few wackjobs wearing pajamas, am I right?
you see? - Yeah, but the situation we discussed...
I'm working on that.
you have to give me time. - We don't have time.
they're not here now, are they? - They'll be here soon.
how soon?
Raizo.
Mika! Go with her, secure the prisoner. AGENT 1: Go, go, go.
agent 1 [ON RADIO]: Team two, we're on our way down to the holding cell.
what's your 20?
agent 2 [ON RADIO]: We're just now entering section four.
agent 3: Hold your fire. Hold your fire.
good way to get killed. - I need that cell open.
we're moving the prisoner. - Those are not my orders.
RAIZO: Mika! Get out of here! - Not without you!
then we all die together.
agent 1: Open fire! Multiple targets!
open that gate. - I can't do that.
go to infrared, boys.
they're already in the room.
agent 1: Open fire!
agent 2: We're under attack! Unknown number!
shit.
Oh, Mika, Mika.
Shh.
I like you more and more.
MIKA: Okay, all right.
shit.
Mika, hurry. - Okay.
Mika, I don't wanna sound critical...
look, I'm doing the best I can here.
we don't have much time! - Shit!
let's go.
MIKA: Oh, God.
agent [ON RADIO]: We are heavily engaged with the enemy, I repea...
wait here.
let's go.
agent: We got two men over on the side!
MASLOW: Get down, get down!
look out!
the car's upstairs. Go.
go now. - Okay.
ninja 1: Murderer.
ninja 2: Traitor. So long, brother.
ninja 3: Vengeance, betrayal begets blood, brother. Murderer.
ninja 4: Death. Kill. Murderer. Kill him. Just. Vengeance.
TAKESHl: Little brother.
come on, Raizo.
Raizo, where are you?
shit.
MIKA: Fuck!
shit. Oh, my God. Okay.
okay.
Oh, my God!
driver 1: Come on!
driver 2: Watch it! Help!
goodbye, little brother.
get in!
I can't believe I found you.
I was waiting for you.
Ugh! - Oh, God.
I have to get you to a hospital.
no. Not a hospital.
just keep moving.
maslow [ON PHONE]: Mika, where are you? - He told me to keep moving.
MASLOW: Is he still alive? - After a fashion.
Jesus Christ. Listen, I'm gonna bring you in.
no, not this time. - There are too many people involved.
it's just a matter of time. - I don't think we have much time.
Mika.
shit.
I know you can't hear me...
... so I'm sure this doesn't matter...
... but I'm gonna say it anyway.
I'm just a forensic researcher.
it's like a fancy way of saying I'm a librarian.
by myself, I can't do anything to help you.
I wanted to thank you for saving my life.
and I hope you can forgive me for this.
agent Maslow! The tracking device. MASLOW: Yeah?
you got a lock? - Triangulating her position now.
MASLOW: I want the International Task Force mobilized and ready to go in five minutes.
ninja 1: At last.
kill him.
ninja 2: Slit his throat.
TAKESHl: No.
our father should have the honor.
take him to Father. NINJA 1: Bring him to Father.
agent 1: Clear. AGENT 2: Clear.
they took him 10 minutes ago.
he's gone.
OZUNU: You are Ozunu.
you are part of me, as I am part of you.
this is the truth of your lives.
and it will remain true after death.
my child.
it is good to see you again.
do you know there was a time...
... when I looked at you...
... I felt such pride.
no child ever showed more promise.
you are the son I was waiting for...
... the one to take my place.
and now, do you know what you have done?
how you have shamed my family?
how you have hurt me?
why do you think I did it?
get this thing...
... out of my sight.
tonight we avenge our brothers and sisters.
tonight we avenge our honor.
let this death be remembered for a thousand years.
weakness compels strength.
betrayal begets blood.
RAIZO: You are getting weak...
... old man.
father!
agent: Move it!
shit!
what took you? - You knew I'd come?
just because I was asleep doesn't mean I couldn't hear you.
and I forgive you.
Mika!
come, this way.
you swore to me you'd stay inside the APC.
I thought we were too late. - First team is ready, sir!
MASLOW: Hit it! AGENT: Go!
stay here.
agent: You two, with me!
come, little brother.
let us play like old times.
my turn.
agent: Watch the roof!
do you still think about her?
do you remember the sound she made when I stuck her?
agent 1: Watch the roof!
agent 2: Three o'clock! I need a solid perimeter on the left, now!
you remember...
... all I taught you.
you are still Ozunu.
come. Beg your father for forgiveness.
OZUNU: Your heart is weak.
Raizo!
all this loss, this waste...
... because you put yourself before your family.
this is not my family.
you are not my father.
and the breath I take after I kill you...
... will be the first breath of my life.
Mika, run! - Where is he?
where is he?
RAIZO: Get away!
Mika!
No!
most children are disappointments...
... not worth the effort to raise.
Mika.
Jesus Christ, what happened?
she saved my life.
MASLOW: Medic!
medic!
she'll be all right.
her heart is special.
I need a medic here now!
is she gonna be all right? MEDIC: I don't understand.
she's got a hole right through her heart, but...
my heart is over here.
come with me.
are you Thomas Gates? Yes.
we got something that we'd like you to take a look at.
I hear you're quite good with puzzles and riddles.
it's a coded message. It's a Playfair cipher.
playfair cipher? Can you decode it?
cipher's impossible to decode without the key.
what do you mean by "a key"? A keyword or phrase.
I believe what you need is right there.
it'll take some time.
go on. I'll take your diary. I'll meet up with you later.
...calculate the distance and you're sure to hit the mark in about most things as well as shootin'.
...ready to pour out all over you like apple sass over roast pork.
I'll take care not to give up my hold on poor De Boots till I am quite sure of the American.
Ah, that's my own girl.
augusta, dear, to your room.
...to turn you inside out, old gal, you sockdologizing old mantrap.
SiC semper tyrannis!
temples.
gold.
C? bola? This is a treasure map.
KGC? You're Knights of the Golden Circle. You're a traitor.
you're all traitors.
president Lincoln's been shot!
everybody, out! All of you!
killer's on the loose!
I'd much appreciate it if you'd finish deciphering that code now.
dad! The war is over.
No!
No! No!
you're wrong about that.
the war has only just begun!
Charles. The debt that all men... men pay.
the debt that all men p...
dad! No, please!
come back. It's not fair.
help! Somebody help, please!
so recapping:
the Knights of the Golden Circle was a Southern extremist group, operating in the north to subvert Union forces.
had Thomas not burned the legendary missing pages from the Booth diary, the killers may have found a vast treasure of gold, and the Union may well have lost the Civil War.
thank you.
I'd like to thank Ben and Patrick Gates.
thank you.
and say what a wonderful addition Thomas Gates is to our civilian heroes exhibit.
thank you.
thank you, Dr. Nichols. I only wish my grandfather had been here to see this wonderful day.
excuse me. I have a question I'd like to ask.
what do you think happened to that Booth diary page that was pulled out of the fire?
we may never know.
perhaps.
perhaps not.
you see, I have one of those greatgreatgranddaddies, like you, way up in my family tree, name of Silas Wilkinson.
he used to tell a story about the night Lincoln was shot.
as Silas tells it,
booth didn't seek out Thomas Gates regarding the treasure map that night.
it was Thomas who called the meeting.
a meeting to plan the assassination of Lincoln.
how absurd. That's a lie!
ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...
...one of the missing pages from the infamous diary of John Wilkes Booth with the name Thomas Gates written on a list along with all the other killers.
and Latin? Booth was a student of Latin.
he shouted, "Sic semper tyrannis" after he shot Lincoln.
thus always to...
thus always to tyrants. " We know.
Surratt, copiae"? Military supplies.
Mary Surratt was convicted and hanged for supplying Booth with a rifle and field glasses.
thomas Gates, artifex. " "Designer
or "mastermind. " I know what it means.
he must have, uh, planned the assassination.
I see. Could mean mastermind of anything.
you see that? Burned out right there.
I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you.
may I, Mr...? Wilkinson.
I'll see if this new page matches the Booth diary.
this is an outrage. You're calling my grandfather a liar.
with respect, now you're calling my greatgreatgranddaddy a liar.
Yes, sir, I am. This isn't some garbage from a history book.
my grandfather told me this story himself.
I saw the truth of it in his eyes.
I'm sorry, sir. I truly am.
we'll test this thoroughly, Patrick, to authenticate it.
it can't be.
maps to presidents' houses.
keys to locks that don't exist.
what's the point? What am I looking for?
proof, proof, proof.
what proof?
Oh, wow. Is this a book about the Templar treasure?
Yes, it is about the Templar treasure, but it's also about other things.
conspiracy theories, urban legends and other myths that are true.
so the author's here signing copies?
I'm the author.
you are? Yeah. See, uh...
there's a picture of me right there.
I think it's a pretty good picture.
I thought that guy, Benjamin Gates, found the treasure.
well, yes, Ben did, but I am the cofinder.
Oh, I've never heard of you. Oh!
Oh, my gosh. Are you Ben Gates?
Yes. Yes, I am.
do you own a red Ferrari?
Yes, I do. Well, it's being towed.
Hm?
wait! Wait! That's my car!
Where's the Ferrari?
IRS impounded it. The IRS?
funny story. My accountant set up a corporation on an island that didn't exist and assured me that that's how rich people do it.
then I got audited and slapped with a huge fine plus interest.
wanna know what taxes are on five million dollars?
six million dollars.
but enough about me.
what's new with you?
well, my girlfriend kicked me out, I'm living with my dad, my family killed President Lincoln. All right.
I need your help.
I can't believe you have to break into your own house.
I need to get Abigail's ID.
she has access to the Booth diary page.
why don't you ask Abigail for her help?
she changed the alarm code, Riley. She's not going to talk to me.
all right.
we have 30 seconds after the alert starts to disable the alarm.
go.
I'll probably regret asking this, but what happened with you and Abigail?
I don't know. I don't know. She started using the word "so" a lot.
so?
Yeah, like, "So, I guess my opinion doesn't matter.
so, you seem to always know what's best.
so, I guess I'm invisible.
now I've moved out, we're dividing furniture...
Oh.
women. Can't live with them, especially if they change the alarm codes.
you did that in 25 seconds.
that's why I tell people to get a dog.
got it. All right, let's go.
that's not Abigail's car.
she was on a date.
isn't that that guy? The White House guy?
the White House Easter Egg Roll is next Monday. Maybe if you're not...
he's weird!
what happens if kids don't find all the eggs?
Wow. You work in a museum, and you live in one.
pretty much.
what clever repartee. She must like him.
all right, let me give you a tour of the house.
OK. That's actually kind of...
Oh, Abigail.
what are you doing here? I just needed to get some things.
Connor, good to see you again. Gates.
how did you get in, Ben?
Riley! Come out here!
what?
Hey! What are you doing here? I mean, it's your house, but...
I sent you a copy of my book. Did you get a chance...?
no, I haven't read it yet. Mm.
I know you. You're the White House curator.
I'm Riley. We met, uh, back in...
right. You're, uh, Ben's assistant.
what?
um, maybe I should go.
Yeah, I'm really... Dinner tomorrow night?
I... I actually already have plans for tomorrow.
you do?
of course you do. But I'm free on Friday.
awkward. Oh, great.
good night. Good night.
I cannot believe you broke in.
what did you take? It's just my things.
hand it over, Ben.
I need to see the Booth diary page.
you saw the page yourself. There is no treasure map on it.
no, it's a cipher leading to a map.
anyone spectralimage the page?
no need to. The ink writing on the page is clearly visible.
it could have been erased or faded.
you're the director of document conservation. You know this.
not up to me. It's not my department.
that department reports to your department.
come on. One look under infrared.
you can have the Boston Tea Tables.
both of them?
we've been looking at this page for hours.
there's nothing there.
Ben, I really don't think we're going to find anything on this page.
in a hundred years, no one's going to remember anyone involved in the Lincoln assassination besides Booth.
that's not true. Do you know the expression, "His name is mud"?
Yes. Of course. You do?
you know the origin of the expression?
does anyone but you?
Dr. Samuel Mudd was convicted of being a coconspirator in the Lincoln assassination. The evidence was circumstantial.
he was later pardoned, but it didn't matter.
Mudd's name still lives in infamy.
and I will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud.
Ben. What?
look at this.
see that? Oh.
that's quite something, isn't it? Yeah. It says "smudge.
it's nothing.
residual ink from the facing page. Flip it.
the letters are backwards.
it's a cipher. Yes. It is.
a cipher. See how the letters are coupled?
playfair ciphers encode letters in pairs.
this could prove his story.
unless you decode the cipher, this does not prove a theory.
that's OK. We need a fiveletter keyword.
what's the keyword? I don't know yet.
all right. Uh, can I get a printout of this?
there's a billion words in the English language.
got to be a logical... Let's start from the beginning.
A. Aardvark.
don't want to rain on your parade here, but I don't think this is gonna stop
Dr. Nichols from announcing the discovery of the page tomorrow.
no, now, wait. Can't you ask him to wait until I prove Thomas is innocent?
what if he isn't innocent?
sir? Looks like our old friend Ben Gates is in the news again.
what did he find now? Atlantis?
a guy came forward with a missing Booth diary page.
that's not the best part. Listen to this.
on the page are the names of the conspirators in the Lincoln assassination, as well as a previously unknown conspirator,
thomas Gates. Thomas Gates is said to be the greatgreatgrandfather of treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates.
thought my relatives were bad.
what do we know about this Wilkinson?
sir? Guy claims he had this page for 140 years then just suddenly comes forward with it?
Why? We'll find out.
better.
bacon.
keep going. That's stupid.
how's he doing? Keep working.
we're grateful to the Wilkinson family for coming forth with the page.
on the page is a name of a previously unknown conspirator, Thomas Gates.
Nichols has bought into it. See?
would you stop watching that.
it's on the Internet!
no stopping it now. Gates may have been the architect...
they have no understanding. You know the truth.
that's all that matters. You heard the story from Grandpa.
the story? This guy's got evidence. He's got everything.
we have a story. We have nothing.
for one brief moment, the Gates family could hold its head up.
now we're a bunch of crazies. But we're not liars.
wilkinson is saying that Thomas Gates was a mastermind to one of the darkest hours in U. S. history.
and he burned the diary page to cover that up.
you and I both know he burned the page to keep Booth's men from finding the treasure.
that's what we're going to prove.
only one way to prove it.
find the treasure.
you've got to find it. You're going to help me find it. So come on.
let's hear the story again from Grandpa Charles.
grandpa heard his father say, "Treasure map.
then there was a commotion. Got all that. Anything after that?
anything he said, something he did? Anything at all?
wait a minute. What?
he took his son's hand.
he looked him in the eye, and he said, with his dying breath, "The debt that all men pay.
the debt that all men pay"?
the debt that Thomas paid.
that's five letters.
Oh!
try "Death.
what? It's the keycode.
the debt that all men pay is death.
all right.
it's Labool...
it's gibberish.
Laboulaye! Laboulaye!
what is that?
it's a who. douard Laboulaye.
Where's the phone?
I don't know. Can't find anything in this mess.
temporary till I find a new place.
find the old one. I like her.
Hi. Dr. Chase.
Abigail, please. Abigail.
nice to meet you. Have a seat.
thanks for agreeing to meet with me.
of course. I was actually going to call you about the diary page.
any news? Well...
we actually found some latent letter fragments on it.
take a look.
random letters. A cipher?
maybe. Gates seen this?
he's the one that discovered it.
I'm sorry. Not a problem.
I need one minute. Please, take your time.
Hey. What?
we cracked the cipher. It's "Laboulaye.
the cipher spells "Laboulaye.
so? Laboulaye was wellknown in France.
it could be nothing.
or maybe there was a treasure map like Thomas Gates said there was, and Laboulaye had it.
we only got a partial on the next word.
l AD, lad... ladder...
lad. Aladdin! Aladdin?
lady! Thank you, Abigail!
Laboulaye Lady. Do you know what Laboulaye was planning right around the time Lincoln was assassinated?
OK, Ben, I've got to go.
there's a map or a clue to a map on the Statue...
she hung up. She took your call. That was good.
Dr. Gates? Yes.
sounds like he cracked the cipher. I couldn't help but overhear.
Laboulaye? As in douard Laboulaye?
he seems to believe so, yes.
man who had the idea for the Statue of Liberty.
you're saying there's a treasure map in the Statue of Liberty?
Laboulaye was a Mason.
they built clues into everything.
did you learn that from my book?
have an interest in history? Fascinated by it.
civil War, especially. My family's descended from
confederate General Albert Pike.
he was a remarkable man.
but, then again, what is history but a marker for the deeds of great men?
a man only has one lifetime, but history can remember you forever.
so the only question is, which Statue of Liberty?
exactly.
is there more than one?
there are three, actually, Riley.
one is in New York, one in the Luxembourg Garden.
but he only referred to one as his "lady.
but he only referred to one as his "lady.
this is like, impossible, what you're doing.
I'm glad you're enjoying it.
Laboulaye had to leave a clue somewhere on here.
move in on the torch.
let me get there. It's not as easy as it looks.
no. Believe me, I understand.
excuse me, officer. May I help you?
Ah, American, eh?
of course you see no problem in disturbing everyone's pleasant morning with your buzzing there. Hey!
you know how much our constitution was influenced by your man, Montesquieu?
you know Montesquieu? Got it.
Montesquieu, yeah. "A government should be set up so that...
... no man need be afraid of another.
that's very good. Thank you.
I'm astonished. I got it, I got it.
I hope you read French. May I?
he's a cop.
um... "Across the sea these twins stand determined...
resolute. "Resolute," yeah.
... to preserve what we are looking for.
uh... Laboulaye, 1876." Six.
it's a clue. "These twins stand resolute.
let's see. Resolute twins.
resolute.
resolute. And then twins.
Siamese twins? Siam? Trade routes between France and Thailand?
that's ridiculous. HMS Resolute.
a British ship that got lost in the Arctic in the 1800s.
it was salvaged by American whalers, and then Congress sent it back to England.
when the ship was finally retired,
queen Victoria had two desks made from its timbers.
voil. Resolute twins.
and where are those desks now?
the closest one is in London.
how fast can we get to Buckingham Palace?
don't know. Why don't you ask your new best friend?
he's going to call you a cab.
OK?
nice helicopter. Is that yours? Yes, actually. It is.
OK, so you get the ticket. Great.
Mitch Wilkinson studied history at Virginia Military Institute.
graduated 1978. Ran a private security company which had contracts in Iraq during the invasion, and in the Congo in the late '90s.
these are trained mercenaries as well as being blackmarket antiquities dealers.
so why does a black market antiquities dealer...
...give up a rare Civil War artifact?
something he could sell to a private collector for a good deal of money?
so the queen's office is here.
the elevator shaft gets you close, but the only direct access is through security.
that should be exciting. We got to get you in that room.
Hi, Dad. Ben.
it's Patrick Gates' phone. He's calling Ben.
give me that.
the house was broken into last night. I was attacked.
call the police. I'm coming home.
what? What good would that do?
they didn't take anything. And besides, I'm fine.
OK. We're in London. We're going to Buckingham Palace.
we have an appointment with the curator tomorrow afternoon.
son, just be careful. Goodbye. Bye.
someone else is after the treasure.
of course someone else is after the treasure.
it's the axiom of treasure hunting.
we have to hurry and see that desk.
we don't want to miss that appointment.
Hi. Ben Gates.
see security. They'll let you in.
Wow.
OK. It's teatime, chaps.
looking for the curator's office. Which way was it again?
follow the stairs round, then turn first left.
thank you so much.
Ben. Abigail.
what's she doing here? What're you doing?
your dad called me. Said your next clue was here.
she's really there? Ben...
drop her. Lose her. I want to help.
that's very nice, but it's a bad time right now.
a bad time, right now? It's a bad time.
OK, I just flew all the way to London to offer my help...
remember the plan. You don't need it?
you're the one making a scene.
I... I'm not making a scene right now.
we want to make a scene.
well then, fine! If that's what you want, let's have it out now!
so subtle. Let me guess? It's the wrong time.
it's the wrong place. I'm wrong again!
wrong about us, wrong about Thomas Gates, wrong that you'd like the Queen Anne chair!
you're wrong to assume I'd like the chair.
you see? Everybody, listen to this. This is more interesting than that.
she thinks that even when I'm right, I'm wrong!
isn't that right?
Abigail, just because I answer a question quickly doesn't make it wrong.
not if the answer's something we need to figure out as a couple.
that's what couples do! Sir.
you and your missis, take it outside.
now look what you've done. You've brought the little bobbies down on us!
you take the missis outside. I'm staying right here.
Ben! Whee!
good afternoon, sir. Hello.
been drinking, have we? Just a nip.
popped down to the pub for a pint! Bit of all right!
going to arrest a man for that?
going to detain a blighter for enjoying his whiskey?
enough. Bangers and mash.
bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie.
sir! Haggis!
that's it! Dismount the banister!
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts!
here they are, standing in a row!
small ones, big ones, some as big as your head!
that was brilliant.
what's wrong with being right? Nothing. You should try it sometime.
you're saying that I'm never right? I did not say that.
hoo! So I'm wrong again.
now, see, there you are correct. Capital. Topper.
your mother told me about you.
in here, please. Why don't you just make a list of what's OK for me to say or not write something...
what's right or wrong... You two, stay.
right? No! No, no, man.
don't leave me in here! That's great. Wow.
what is going on?
I'm sorry for getting you roped into this, but you were excellent.
thank you. So were you. When did you figure out it was a fake argument? When'd you figure out I was arguing during the fake argument?
the middle.
where "I assume I'm right.
get us out. Which I don't get.
if I'm right, after I assume I'm right, then I'm correct.
when you get to a conclusion without asking, and you happen to be right, you got lucky.
I get lucky a lot.
so where does that leave me, Ben?
you guys are so great together.
want to know why I'm here? Uhhuh.
think there may be a clue on the Resolute desk in the queen's study.
does that help?
don't understand why it's difficult for you to include others in your decisions.
just because you may know what my answer is going to be doesn't mean you don't have to ask me.
door number one, opening.
OK. Let me try this out.
Abigail, would you like to come with me, please?
Yes. Thank you.
ridiculous. You're staying.
it's too dangerous. I am so coming.
door number two. Door two, coming up.
you're not coming. Call security.
you should be near a service elevator.
what are you doing? Are those for the queen?
queen's not here. There's no flag flying. Queen's at Windsor.
what are you doing? See the desk, without you.
no. Don't let her go.
Abigail...
all right. Get in. Get in. Get in!
hold this.
will you give me the flowers back, please?
Yeah.
what? Wearing the perfume I bought you.
so?
so I think it smells kind of pretty.
it's the flowers, Ben. No, it's not.
let's go.
OK, now turn left.
dead end. I mean right. Go right.
the flowers... petals... stamens. Good. Good.
go, go.
that's it.
the Resolute desk.
we're looking for...
...writing, patterns in the carvings. Could be anything.
Hey, look at this.
Malcolm Gilvary, 1880." Hold on one second.
here we go. Malcolm Gilvary. He didn't make furniture.
he made Chinese puzzle boxes.
Oh... What?
I think these drawers work like tumblers in a safe.
OK, four drawers... Fourdigit combination?
what about a year?
uh, let me see. Queen Victoria, born 1819.
so you go one...
any luck? OK... 1876 was on the inscription on the statue in Paris. Let's try that.
Uhoh.
new rules.
these markings, like Incan or Aztec.
I have never seen any symbols like this.
I mean, this looks centuries older than Civil War.
what do you think it means?
I doubt it has anything to do with the plot to assassinate Lincoln.
Uhoh.
mayday. Mayday. Ben, get out of there.
Oi! Where are my detainees?
OK, let's make some noise.
the fire alarm's gone off.
Uhoh. God save the queen.
all units, go to action zebra.
what's going on? Haven't the foggiest.
someone or something is causing this.
check your primary stations. This doesn't make any sense.
find the source terminal and check public areas four and eight.
this way, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. Keep moving.
keep walking until you're on the other side of the fountain.
excuse me, excuse me. Coming through.
I got them. They're at the main gate.
Oi! Sparkle. Come on. OK. Here we go.
I'm a little bit allergic.
Riley. Thank you. OK.
see you later. Thank you. Byebye. Sit! Sorry!
thanks for waiting for me. Can I see the thing?
Daniel, hold it.
what is that?
went to Buckingham Palace, all I got was this wood?
look at the symbols. Never seen anything like this.
it's an incredible discovery.
Wilkinson. Stop them. Go, go, go!
he's the one after the treasure. I'll drive.
we're in England.
it's a gun! Get down!
we're trapped! Hang on! Keep your heads down.
Hey, who are you?
sorry.
Ben, they're getting closer. What is their problem?
go left! Go left! Hold on.
turn, turn!
watch out!
everybody OK?
come on, come on. Danny, I want them stopped.
look out!
go. Go, go, go, go!
did you see where he went?
what is that? Someone's phone. It's him.
have his number in your speed dial?
Oh, shu...
this has to end before someone gets hurt.
give me what you got at Buckingham, it won't be necessary.
tell that to my father.
moron!
why are they standing in the middle of the street?
where are these people going? Why's everyone running?
he's right there! Go! Move!
get out of the way!
did I just run over a man's foot? Watch the people!
go! Go! Faster!
right over there. I got them.
they're still behind us. This phone have a camera?
no. No, it's broken. All right. Give me the plank.
hang on. We're going to run a red light.
hack into the London Police database and get a picture from that traffic cam.
Okeydokey. You can't do it?
no, I can. I just don't like that you assume that I can.
why, thank you, Riley.
get it!
stop! Stop!
he's got it. What is it?
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.
Abigail! Hey, Patrick.
nice to see you two together again.
Yeah, well, we're not. Yeah.
Oh, I was hoping to get some of these boxes out of the house.
I can't read the whole thing, but I can tell you that these are definitely precolonial Native American markings.
easily 500 years old. Easily.
I can identify one symbol.
look at this. Do you know what that is?
sacred calendrical? I don't know.
that symbol is C? bola.
that's C? bola.
the City of Gold.
the City of Gold.
in 1527, a Spanish ship wrecked on the Florida coast.
there were only four survivors.
one was a slave named Estebn who saved a local tribe's dying chief.
as a reward, he was taken to their sacred city, a city built from solid gold.
later, when Estebn tried to find the city again, he never could.
but the legend grew, and every explorer came to the New World in search of it.
when General Custer's search for gold ended with his last stand at Little Bighorn, it became clear none would ever find it.
Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates got their hands on the City of Gold...
my God.
I'm going to go talk to her.
you're coming with me. No!
Hey. No one else can translate it. There are others.
there are several others.
for ancient Native American? No one better.
who? Look, Ben, I can't go with you.
it's been, what? Twentyfive years. Thirtytwo.
that long?
there's a reason why we haven't spoken in 32 years.
we have nothing in common. Me?
Yes, of course. And I'm sure she's just as proud of you as I am.
who? His mom.
will you relax? It's gonna be fine.
sure. Should look at the bright side.
been a long time. Maybe she lost her memory, won't recognize me.
I hate her!
we're in the right place.
I'm gonna take myself out of the line of fire for this one.
Hi, Mom. Benjamin!
Abigail! What a surprise! Hello, sweetheart.
Hi.
Oh.
you see? One syllable, a knife in the heart.
Oh, no. She can do that.
I can also track the whereabouts of my toothbrush.
I was not the one that left the toothbrushes in Marrakech.
I stowed them both in the travel case, as instructed.
Yes, and you also insisted on loading the luggage into the taxi.
didn't insist. I loaded the luggage.
not the travel case.
travel case is not luggage. The case goes into the luggage.
who was in charge of packing? I couldn't get the case into the luggage. It was full with that stupid rug you bought.
you thought it had secret stitching.
how stupid was that? Did have stitching.
six phony green leather suitcases... Mom.
I need you to take a look at this.
what is that a picture of? It's interesting.
we think it might be Olmec. It is.
Yes, yes, definitely protoZoquean.
we were hoping that you could translate it.
Yes, of course you were.
Oh, this doesn't involve another treasure hunt, does it?
mom, this is actually very important.
all right. What have we got here?
this... this glyph here, that means "bird. " And that means...
uh, "noble bird.
find the noble bird, let him take you by the hand and give you passage to the sacred temple.
Oh, you think this is a treasure map for C? bola, don't you?
well, that is exactly what it is.
no, this glyph doesn't mean "C? bola.
it means "the center of the world.
you know, you used to like it.
she fell in love with me on a treasure hunt.
that was not love. That was excitement, adrenaline and tequila.
mom... I was trying to get course credit.
treasure hunting paid off, in case you haven't read the papers.
had nothing to do with you. That was Ben.
Ben found the treasure. You did nothing.
Patrick, Emily, please.
can we just figure out what's on the page?
well, that's it, I'm afraid.
these glyphs are only partials.
so you only have half a treasure map.
I'm sorry.
not that I'm surprised.
at least we know where the rest of the map is.
what?
you know where it is? Why didn't you tell me?
obviously you have a tendency to overreact!
I'm sorry. So am I.
so where is it?
inscription on the statue in Paris said, "These twins stand resolute.
we think the map's divided between the two Resolute desks.
the Resolute desk. The Resolute desk?
president's desk?
the president. What president?
our president? Unfortunately, yes.
but that means...
wait, so we have to...
the White House?
the Oval Office... to be exact.
why would I overreact to that?
that's not what I signed on for.
could we focus on the issue at hand?
thank you.
it's early, preColumbian.
can you translate it? Are you kidding?
this is an extinct, exceedingly rare language.
only a handful of people study these languages.
where are we to find them?
universities, I suppose. But you don't have the whole thing.
what do you mean?
these glyphs here... they're cut off.
there's more to the map? How are we going to find that?
we won't have to. Gates will get it somehow.
the Resolute desk is near the south wall in the Oval Office.
look at this. Look.
small door on the front of the desk.
FDR had that put in so guests couldn't see his wheelchair.
but... Guys, take a look at this.
this could work.
I believe it's time for you to make a date with your new boyfriend.
I think you're right.
we hope you're enjoying the White House Easter Egg Roll.
face painting continues at 2: 00 near the south fountain.
that Connor in the bunny suit? Thank you.
I've never been to an Easter Egg Roll. It's kind of sweet.
Yeah, I love it.
I know you. Your greatgreatgrandfather killed President Lincoln.
no. That would be John Wilkes Booth.
Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool in a greater conspiracy that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet.
absurd. Eisenschiml's book is filled with spotty research and false assumptions. Oh, yeah?
explain why Lincoln's bodyguard left his post that night?
because President Lincoln was never accompanied by guards when attending the theater. Listening? Especially on Good Friday.
explain why all the bridges out of Washington were closed except one, the one Booth needed to escape?
OK, run along now, you impossible child. Run along.
what is going on with the education in America?
Hey! Hey! Connor!
I'm so glad you decided to come... Hey.
... with Gates. Connor.
we just ran into each other. Oh.
aren't you going to ask him?
ask me what? Nothing.
no, really. What? I really wouldn't want to impose.
well, what she means is she doesn't think you can.
doesn't think I can what?
she wants to see the Oval Office.
no. That is way too much to ask. No, it's, uh...
I can do that. Really?
you see?
you can? Yeah.
that is so cool, Connor. I have always wanted to see the Oval Office.
Connor rocks.
well... here we are.
empire furnishings and crenelated molding. Love it.
amazing feeling, isn't it, standing in here?
Yes. Amazing, huh? Oh, could...
Oh. Sorry.
Oh, that's, uh... The Resolute desk.
might recognize it from the photo of young JFK Junior playing underneath while his father was working.
wonderful. Yeah.
but many people don't know that this desk has a twin that sits in Buckingham Palace.
isn't that something? Who knew?
every president since Rutherford B. Hayes has used that desk, except, uh, Johnson and Nixon.
and Ford, of course.
uh, no. Uh, yes.
no. Yes.
Abigail! Did you lose an earring?
Oh! I... I did, yes.
Connor, these were given to me by my grandmother.
I suppose we should look for it. Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring that doesn't belong to the first lady in the Oval Office.
Yes. Excellent point, considering we're not supposed to be here.
Yeah. Why don't we, um, go over here and check it out?
I'll check over here.
do you think it fell down here? Yes.
maybe here. Probably.
Oh, no.
you did sit on the sofa. Oh, the bunnies.
Connor!
you found it. I did.
thank you so much!
uh...
you're just the best. Mm.
thank you.
OK.
empty. Someone must've taken it.
brightest men in our country sat at that desk for over a hundred years.
look. Course one of 'em found the map.
a symbol stamped into the wood. The presidential seal.
it's not the presidential seal.
the eagle's holding a scroll instead of olive branches.
I'm not sure what this is. What do we do?
did none of you read my book?
the eagle clutching the scroll.
do you know what it means? Yeah.
but it's not something I could tell you.
it's something that I have to show you... in my book.
you didn't even open it? I was moving.
chapter 13.
the President's Secret Book"?
the President's Secret Book.
it happens to be a collection of documents for presidents by presidents, and for presidents' eyes only.
and I'm not just talking about JFK here, guys.
the 18 and a half missing minutes of the Watergate tapes.
did the Apollo really land on the moon? Did it? Did it?
and the coup de grace... Area 51.
come on, Riley. That's... that's an urban legend.
is it, Abigail? Is it?
it's just totally...
crazy? Yeah.
hm. 'Cause last time I checked, we pretty much make our living on crazy.
he's got a point. I guess so.
same symbol.
released in '66 under the Freedom of Information Act.
the eagle and the scroll, the secret symbol in the President's Book.
so you're saying that whatever was on that plank is now in the President's Secret Book?
Ben.
if it was you trying to convince me...
...you'd have less evidence, and I'd already believe you by now.
the eagle with the scroll?
conspiracy theorists like to believe that it's the symbol for the President's Secret Book.
you bought Riley's book.
your friend writes a book about government conspiracies.
you don't think we know about it? But is it true?
does the president have a secret book?
do you like ducks?
there is a book.
why are you telling me out here?
because inside, I'm a federal agent.
out here, I'm talking to you as a friend.
Where's the President's Book kept?
only the current president knows.
the book is passed from president to president, and each one chooses his own hiding place.
you're the FBl. Can't you get it for me?
only way you'll ever see that book is if you get elected president.
well, you never know.
all I need is a few minutes with him.
a few minutes? Really?
even if you were married to the president, you wouldn't be able to get a few minutes.
not when he's surrounded by handlers.
if I get him alone...
how do you expect to get the president alone?
before the Civil War, the states were all separate.
people used to say, "The United States are.
wasn't until the war ended people started saying, "The United States is.
under Lincoln... we became one nation.
and Lincoln paid for it with his life.
so did Thomas Gates. Right.
with his life.
so how am I gonna get him alone?
I'm gonna kidnap him.
I'm gonna kidnap the president of the United States.
that's not funny. I'm your father.
how do you expect me to respond?
I can't let you ruin your life.
are you out of your mind?
read my book, and you'd know you can't get to that book.
exactly how do you plan on doing this?
I was thinking Mount Vernon.
what? I'm in.
sir, we have to move the party.
some historian claims the Spencer Landmark Hotel was used for Klan meetings in the late 1800s.
anyone know if this is true?
I've got the Washington Gazette.
they want a quote on, "Is the president being insensitive to minority issues?
doesn't matter. Get a list of approved alternates.
what do you have? Yeah, I know it's short notice.
the pipe burst in the hotel that we previously booked.
I... There is water everywhere.
a retirement party for 200 people.
Gunston Hall. Monticello is booked.
so is Gunston Hall and Tudor Place.
the Denby Hotel is available, and so is Mount Vernon.
Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver. The Denby is great.
strike that. The Denby was booked. Mount Vernon's all we got.
book it before someone else does.
and let me say what an honor it is to be here and add my happy birthday to you, Mr. President.
bow to the board.
this is the boy.
born here in the workhouse. Moved to the parish farm.
nine years old today. Time to be moved back here.
what's your name, boy?
Oliver Twist. - What?
that boy's a fool. - Boy. Listen to me.
you know you are an orphan, I suppose.
what's that? -The boy is a fool. I thought he was.
you know you've got no father or mother...
...and that you were brought up by the parish, don't you?
Yes, sir. -What are you crying for?
I hope you say your prayers every night.
pray for those that feed you and take care of you...
...Iike a Christian.
Yes, sir. -Well...
...you have come here to be educated...
...and to be taught a useful trade.
here, where do you want these?
learn from the boy next to you.
what am I to learn, sir? -Learn to pick out the oakum.
what's oakum, sir?
stop asking so many questions.
Oakum's the fibers you unpick from the old rope.
then it's used again for the ships of Her Majesty's navy.
you're serving your country.
now, get on with it.
Tom, give it a rest, will you? We're trying to sleep.
can't sleep, too hungry. -We're all hungry.
Yes, but I'm frightened.
frightened? Why?
Why? Why?
I'm so hungry, I'm frightened I might eat the lad that sleeps next to me.
o Lord God...
...for the blessing of this generous and bountiful meal...
...that thou hast placed before us...
...we give thanks. Amen.
Amen.
please, sir. I want some more.
what?
please, sir, I want some more.
fetch the beadle!
Mr. Limbkins.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Oliver Twist has asked for more.
for more?!
compose yourself, Mr. Bumble, and answer me distinctly.
do I understand that he asked for more after he had eaten his supper?
he did, sir.
that boy will be hanged.
five pounds.
when I says "whoa," I means "whoa"!
Health-- Healthy...
...appren-- apprentice.
five pounds.
chimney sweeping is a nasty trade.
young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now.
that's because they damp the straw afore they light it in the chimney...
...to make them come out again. Damp straw makes smoke.
smoke sends a boy to sleep, and that's what he wants.
boys is very lazy, gentlemen.
but there's nothing like a good hot blaze to make them come out in a run.
it's humane too. Yes.
because even if they've stuck in the chimney...
...roasting their feet makes them struggle to extricate theirselves.
Yes.
I suppose he's fond of chimney sweeping?
he dotes on it, Your Worship.
very well. I will sign the indentures...
...to make him Mr...
Mr. Gamfield's apprentice.
my boy.
my boy, you look pale and alarmed.
what's the matter?
please, sir. Please, sir.
what is it, my boy?
don't... - Now then.
don't... Don't...
go on, my boy. Don't what?
please don't send me away with this dreadful man, sir.
of all the designing orphans that I've ever seen...
hold your tongue, beadle. -Did Your Worship speak to me?
Yes, hold your tongue.
no. No, out of the question.
we refuse to sanction these indentures.
take the boy away.
and treat him kindly.
he seems to want it.
I've just taken the measure of the two women that died last night.
you'll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry.
think so?
the prices allowed by the board are very small.
so are the coffins.
by the way, you don't know anybody who wants a boy, do you?
liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry. Liberal terms.
now, as you are to meet your new master...
...pull that cap off your eyes.
hold your head up, sir.
dry your eyes, sir.
ls that you, Bumble? -No one else, Mr. Sowerberry.
I've brought the orphan, Oliver Twist.
so this is the orphan, is it?
Mrs. Sowerberry...
...will you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?
Oliver Twist.
how comes an orphan to have any name at all?
I invented it. -You, Mr. Bumble?
I, Mr. Sowerberry.
I name all our foundlings in alphabetical order.
the last was S.
Swubble, I named him.
this was a T. Twist, I named him.
next one as comes will be Unwin...
...and the next, Vilkins.
I've got names ready all through the alphabet, right up to Z.
why, you're quite a literary character, sir.
well, well...
...perhaps I may be. -Mrs. Sowerberry...
...this is the orphan from the workhouse.
dear me, he's very small.
but he'll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry. He'll grow.
Yes, I dare say he will. On our food and drink.
workhouse boys always cost more to keep than they're worth.
get downstairs, you bag of bones.
here, Charlotte...
...give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for the dog.
you don't mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose.
well, it doesn't much matter whether you do or don't...
...for you can't sleep anywhere else.
open the door, will you?
you the new boy? -Yes, sir.
how old are you? -Ten, sir.
then I'll whop you one when I get in, you workhouse brat.
I beg your pardon, sir. Did you knock?
I kicked.
did you want a coffin, sir?
you don't know who I am, I suppose. -No, sir.
well, I'm Mr. Noah Claypole. And you're under me.
now, take down the shutters.
saved a nice little bit of bacon for you from the master's breakfast.
in the corner with you. And be quick about it.
they'll want you to mind the shop. Do you hear?
do you hear, Workhouse? In the corner.
Oh, Lord, Noah, let the boy alone.
let him alone?
why, everybody's let him alone.
his mother, father and all his relations has let him alone.
so he needs someone who don't.
supper.
Oliver, ain't you done yet?
I've never known such an idle boy. Get down them stairs.
Mr. Sowerberry...
...supper.
I've had a thought, my dear. -Had a thought?
you want to be careful, Mr. Sowerberry, you'll get brain fever.
it's about young Twist. - What about him?
a very good-looking boy. -He will be. He eats enough.
there's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear.
he would make a delightful mute, my love.
I-- I don't mean a regular mute to attend grown-up funerals, my dear...
...but only for children's practice.
look at him.
look at him.
a workhouse boy and a sneak. Look at him.
mark my words, I'll see him hung.
can't be too soon.
workhouse, how's your mother?
she's dead.
What'd she die of, workhouse?
you gonna cry, workhouse?
what set you off? -Not you.
not me, eh? -No, not you.
and you better not say anything about my mother.
better not?
about your mother?
well, I'm very sorry, and I pity you very much.
but you must know, workhouse...
...your mother was a regular right-down bad one.
what did you say? - A regular right-down bad one.
it's a good thing she died when she did...
...or she'd be hard laboring or transported.
or hung. Which is most likely, isn't it, workhouse?
help, Mrs. Charlotte!
he'll murder me. Help!
help. Get off!
for God's sake, help me!
my missus, he's murdering me!
get off. Get off me now! -Get him, Charlotte.
get him now. Go out with him. Come on.
workhouse devil. - I'll learn you!
you brat! -Get the door, Charlotte.
in with him. In.
very violent indeed, sir.
and the missus said...
...if Mr. Bumble can spare the time...
...then Mr. Bumble's to flog him...
...because the master's out.
ln there. - Oliver?
let me out of here!
do you know this here voice, Oliver? -Yes.
ain't you afraid of it, sir?
ain't you trembling while I speak, sir?
No!
he must be mad. -It's not madness, ma'am, it's meat.
meat? - Meat, ma'am, meat.
you've overfed him.
if you'd kept this boy on gruel, this would never have happened.
dear, dear. This comes of being liberal.
what's all this?
Oliver Twist has turned violent, Mr. Sowerberry.
look what he's done to my eye, sir.
now then. Now then.
you're a nice young fellow, ain't you? - He called my mother names.
well, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch!
she deserved what he said and worse.
she didn't! - She did!
it's a lie!
do something, Mr. Sowerberry. He called me a liar.
do something!
I beg your pardon, miss...
...but would you be so kind?
get off my land.
I don't want no beggars here. Go on!
get off! Or I'll put the dog on you!
I haven't much, but you're more than welcome to it.
be careful, it's hot.
seeing you gave me such a turn.
my eyes ain't what they were. But...
...I just thought for a moment...
why are you on the road at all, a little mite like you?
where are you headed? - London, ma'am.
London?
London.
dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
Hello, my man.
and what's your game?
you're not from these parts?
where you from, then?
I've been walking. Seven days.
seven days? Cor.
I expect you want grub?
and you shall have it.
I'm at a low-water mark myself just at the moment...
...but I'll fork out and stump.
come on, up with you, on your pins.
Oh, by the way...
...my name is Jack Dawkins, better known as the Artful Dodger.
Oliver Twist.
why are you known as the Artful Dodger?
that's why.
got any lodgings?
money?
I suppose you want someplace to sleep tonight, don't you?
I expect you walking for so long was a beak's order.
what does that mean? - Don't you know what a beak is?
a bird's mouth, isn't it? - Cor, you are green.
a beak's a magistrate, my son. Where you been all your life?
now then. - Plummy and slam.
there's two of you. Who's he? -A new pal.
Where'd he come from? - Greenland.
ls the old one there? - Upstairs, sorting the wipes.
this is him, Fagin. My new friend, Oliver Twist.
well, well, Oliver Twist.
I hope I have the honor of a more intimate acquaintance.
dodger, take off the sausages...
...and let's make a space at the table for Oliver.
you were staring at the pocket handkerchiefs, eh, my dear?
there's a good many of them, ain't there?
we've just looked them out, ready for the wash.
that's all, my dear.
blow it.
hot. Blow it.
now then, Oliver, what you must have...
...is a hot gin and water. Warms the cockles.
only, drink it quick because another of these gentlemen wants the tumbler.
he's such a nice lad.
I have a feeling he'll turn out a hard worker.
Yeah, a hard worker.
Oliver?
Oliver?
clever dogs.
clever dogs.
fine fellows.
all fine fellows.
fine fellows.
fine fellows.
fine fellows.
fine fellows.
what do you watch me for? Why are you awake?
what have you seen? Speak out, boy!
quick. Quick, or it's your life!
I wasn't able to sleep any longer, sir.
I'm very sorry if I disturbed you.
you were not awake a moment ago? - No, sir.
you sure? -Yes, sir.
of course you were asleep, my dear. I know that.
I only tried to frighten you.
you're a brave boy, Oliver.
did you see any of those pretty things, my dear?
Yes, sir.
they...
they're mine, Oliver. My little property.
for my old age.
it's our secret.
you understand, my dear? -Yes, sir.
can I go up now, sir?
now...
I hope you've been at work this morning, my dears.
hard. - As nails.
good boys.
good boys.
what you got, Dodger? - Couple of pocketbooks.
lined? - Pretty well.
Yeah.
dodge.
I don't know, Dodge.
well...
...not as heavy as they might be...
...but very neat...
...and nicely made.
ingenious workman, ain't he, Oliver?
indeed, sir.
and, Charley, what have you got, my dear?
wipes. - Wipes?
they're very good ones.
very.
you haven't marked them well.
the marks should be picked out with a needle. And we'll
we'll teach Oliver how to do it.
shall us, Oliver? - lf you please, sir.
you'd like to make handkerchiefs as easy as Charley Bates, wouldn't you?
very much indeed, if you'll teach me, sir.
I've never met anyone so green.
now then, boys...
...the game.
we'll show Oliver...
...how to make pocket handkerchiefs.
you'd like to play a game, wouldn't you?
Yes, sir.
got the time, guv? - It's...
...8: 00.
playing the game, were we, Fagin? - As is our custom, my dear.
he's new. Who's he? - Oh, this is Oliver.
Oliver...
...these are our very good friends Bet and Nancy.
see, Dodger, you wanna learn from him.
he's got manners, he has a proper gentleman.
we popped in because we were that cold inside.
as is your custom, my dear.
Charley. - Come on, Oliver. Join us.
or don't you sit with the common folk?
now, you wanna be careful of this lot, Oliver.
they'll have you picking -- Picking out the marks.
just what we was teaching him, ain't it, Oliver, my dear?
Yes, sir. - "Yes, sir"?
you know who you're talking to, do you?
what's your mother got to say about you being here?
I haven't got a mother. I'm an orphan.
you're in the right company, then.
come on, Oliver, I'll teach you how to play.
it's called Spec or Speculation.
three cards each, and then the one he turns up...
...is trumps.
this is a pleasant life, ain't it, my dear?
when can I go out, sir? - Soon. Soon.
let's
let's see what you've learned.
would you like that? -Oh, yes, sir.

...without my feeling it.
is it gone?
you're a clever boy, my dear.
I never saw a sharper lad.
here's a shilling for you.
make the Dodger and Charley your models.
especially the Dodger, my dear.
he'll be a great man himself, make you one too.

Where's the gentleman? - Here's the gentleman now.
ls this the boy, sir? -Yes, I'm afraid it is.

poor fellow's hurt himself. -Yeah, I did that, sir.
hurt me knuckle against his mouth. But I stopped him.

Oh, no, sir, I won't hurt him.

officer, who is this fellow?
my name is Brownlow. - Hold your tongue.
officer, what's this fellow charged with?
Oh, no, no. He's not charged, Your Worship.
he appears against the boy.
swear him. - Before I am sworn...
...I must beg to say one word. - Hold your tongue, sir.
I will not, sir! - Hold your tongue this instant.
you're an insolent, impertinent fellow.
how dare you bully a magistrate. - What?

clear the office. - I will not be turned out! I will speak!
I saw it all. I own the bookshop.
I demand to be heard. - What have you got to say?
lt was not this boy. - Not this boy? Who was it, then?
the robbery was committed by two others while the man was reading.
I saw it done. I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed by it.
why didn't you come before?
I hadn't a soul to mind the shop. - Reading, you say?
a book, I suppose.
Yes, the very one he has in his hand.
Oh, dear me, I forgot all about it.
well, you're a nice one.
to prefer a charge against an innocent boy.
I consider, sir, that you've obtained that book...
...under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances.
damn me! - Bookseller...
...do you want to press charges against him?
certainly not. - Well...
...think yourself fortunate...
...that the owner of the book declines to prosecute.
the boy is discharged.
clear the office. -Damn me.
clear the office! Clear the office!
next case.
come on. Move along, sir, please. Just move along, sir.
there's a good gentleman, sir.

Yeah, right away, sir. - I'm sorry.
poor boy.

let me, sir.
there we go.
will you drop me off, sir? - Of course.
all right.
if you could just take his head, sir.
where to, sir? -Pentonville.
Pentonville. -Yes.
answer me! Where is he?
answer me! Where is he?
what's become of the boy? Speak out, or I'll throttle you!
the traps have got him! Let go of me, will you?!
bullseye!
who pitched this here at me? Who done it?
bullseye. Come in, you sneaking warmint.
what you stopping outside for?
lay down.
what you up to, Fagin? Ill-treating the boys again?
a wonder they don't murder you. I would, if I was them.
don't speak so loud. You seem out of sorts, Bill.
give us a drink. And mind you don't poison it.
Charley.
good stuff, Bill.
so, Dodger...
...What's it all about? - A new boy.
come out with us afore he was rightly up to it.
got nabbed by the traps. - You see, Bill...
...I'm afraid he may say something which will get us into trouble.
you were blowed upon, Fagin.
and about time.
and I'm afraid, you see, Bill, that if the game was up with us...
...it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me, my dear.
there's only one thing for it.
somebody's gotta find out at the office what's being done to him.
somebody's gotta get hold of him somehow.
I ain't going near no police office. Not for nobody, nohow.
I have it, the very thing. Bet will go.
won't you, my dear? - I'm blessed if I will.
Nancy, my dear, what do you say?
it won't do. There's no use in trying it on, Fagin.
what do you mean by that? - What I say.
why, you're just the very person for it.
nobody about here knows anything about you.
and as I don't want them to neither.
it's rather more "no" than "yes" with me, Bill.
she'll go, Fagin. - No, she won't, Fagin.
Yes, she will, Fagin.
can I help you, miss? - I'm looking for my little brother.
now, who would he be? - A lovely little boy.
lovely manners. Gentle as falling snow.
we don't get many of those.
I think you'll be wanting Mr. Fang's court.
George, this here young lady is looking for her brother.
the one that fainted and got away with it.
Oh, yeah. Gentleman took him away.
what gentleman? Gracious heavens, what gentleman?
well, lives in Pentonville, I believe.
Oh, my God.
no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
his card's here somewhere.
here we are.
thank you, sir.
Mr. Brownlow.
Mr. Brownlow.
there's something in him...
...that touched my heart, Mrs. Bedwin.
can't explain it.
I feel the same, sir.
who is he? What is he?
you know nothing of him.
he had a fever. What of that?
bad people have fevers sometimes.
I knew a man in Jamaica who was hanged for murdering his master.
he had a fever six times.
I know there is goodness in him. - How do you know it?
goodness and innocence.
I knew it the first moment I saw him. - He'll deceive you.
let you down at the first opportunity...
...Iike all your other good and innocent causes.
if that boy's good and innocent, I'll eat my own head, sir.
how do you feel, my dear?
very happy, sir.
and very grateful to you indeed, sir. - Good boy.
have you given him any nourishment, Bedwin? Any slops?
not slops, sir. Broth.
a couple of glasses of port wine...
...would have done him a great deal more good.
wouldn't they, Sam?
my name is Oliver, sir.
Oliver?
Oliver what? Oliver Waters? -No, sir. Twist. Oliver Twist.
why did you tell the magistrate your name was Waters?
I never told him so, sir.
you did not? -No, sir.
you're not angry with me, are you? - No, no.
queer name.
Oliver Twist.
there are a great many books, are there not, my boy?
a great number, sir.
never saw so many.
how would you like to grow up a clever man...
...and write books?
I think I'd rather read them, sir.
wouldn't you like to be a book writer?
I think it'd be a better thing to be a bookseller, sir.
you have said a very good thing.
well, well.
we won't make an author of you while there's an honest trade to be learned...
are you going to send me away, sir? - No, my dear child.
you need not be afraid that I am going to desert you...
...unless you give me cause. - I never, never will, sir.
I hope not...
...because I feel strongly disposed to trust you.
thank you, sir.
I'm pleased I won't have to wear those again.
so are we all, my dear.
there.
hello.
what's that?
this is young Oliver Twist.
the bookseller's boy brought a package.
Oh, stop him, Oliver. There's some books to go back.
I know, but it's coming.
when is it?
it's not gonna be too much longer.
spit your gum out. Come on. Thank you.
Oh, here comes the train!
get behind me. Ally, stay behind me.
just take it. Take it.
give me your purse. Give me your purse.
give me the ring! - What?
don't talk. - It's gonna be okay.
ally, don't look at them. No, no- Better not, lady.
this is the Coney Island bound F train.
next stop Avenue I.
No!
mom! Mom!
mom! Mom! Mom!
mom! Mom!
mom!
daddy!
Hello?
fifteen minutes.
how are you, Mom? - You look good.
how you doing, Les? - Good to see you.
thanks for the wake-up call, Maestro.
you smell like Listerine and beer.
you couldn't wear a tie?
I could have.
this is nice. Michael would like that we still do this.
did you tell Tyler what your art teacher said about your portrait?
mom!
tell him!
she said I captured the moment like a young James Whistler.
well, at least it's a young James Whistler, because, God, I mean, Whistler, he fell off in the latter half of his career.
he is the Boyz II Men of European art history.
she recommended your sister to Steinhardt's Summer Art Intensive, and that's hugely prestigious. It's fantastic.
it's great.
I'm going to do a drawing called "My Brother and His Favorite Cigarette."
and, since I'd be the youngest person ever, practically, to be studying there...
Tyler, would you please pass the sugar?
she still has a couple of minutes left on the clock, Dad.
just a couple of seconds.
Caroline's perfectly capable of speaking up if she's feeling slighted in any way.
have I slighted you in any way, Caroline?
I'm fine.
I didn't mean to change the subject. - What was the subject?
excuse me?
the subject we were discussing. What was it?
now is not the time for your heroics, Tyler.
actually, now is the perfect time.
all right. I gotta go. - Tyler.
Caroline, do you want me to take you anywhere?
I'm okay. I'll stay with Mom. - All right. I'll see you soon.
the sugar.
eat something.
gandhi said that whatever you do in life will be insignificant, but it's very important that you do it.
I tend to agree with the first part.
Michael, you know what day I'm staring at.
by 22, Gandhi had three kids,
Mozart, 30 symphonies, and Buddy Holly was dead.
you once told me, "Our fingerprints don't fade from the lives we touch."
is that true for everybody?
or was that just poetic bullshit?
I sold your girlfriend a toothbrush.
you sold my who? What? - You know, your girlfriend.
that voluptuous, delightfully oblivious little blonde you left in your bed yesterday?
Yeah. - Yeah, I sold her a toothbrush.
I got three bucks.
Congratulations. - Yeah, are in order.
cause that sale inspired our newest business venture.
the S. L.U. T.
it's a Single Lady's Universal Tote.
it's a one-night-stand travel pack for women. You know?
we throw in makeup and toiletries, a cell phone charger, cab numbers...
we retail it for $19. 95. Maybe we'd do an infomercial.
do you think women will buy this with actual money?
okay. Yeah. You know what? Fine. Be cynical.
but think about it, at one point in history, two people had a conversation, a lot like this one, about the light bulb.
one went on to fame and fortune, the other probably went to work at Mickey D's or something.
in the wake of recent terrorist attacks, do you guys think there's a place for a discussion about ethics when we're talking about the root causes of terrorism?
wasn't it a moral question, not an ethical one?
how so? - Well, morals define personal character.
and ethics?
the standards of behavior expected by a group.
and in the end, personal character is more important?
Absolutely. - That's a good point.
does knowledge of the past limit us or benefit us?
can we make this a non-smoking statue?
Yeah, Tyler. Can we make this a non-smoking statue?
you promised you'd quit. - I know.
why do you think Dad doesn't wanna listen to me?
dad loves you. - So?
you can love someone and not want to spend time with them.
Yeah, you got that right. - Mom loves Aunt Sara.
but at Christmas last year, she wouldn't let Les leave them in a room together 'cause she said that there'd be a "Yuletide homicide."
that's 'cause Aunt Sara drinks. You don't drink, do you?
I'm 11.
so why would anyone ever want to avoid you?
michael used to drink.
that's 'cause Michael was 21.
when you're 21, drinking's new and exciting, and everybody does it.
aunt Sara drinks 'cause she wishes she was 21.
you're 21.
okay.
Hey, what about Atlantic City for your birthday this year, man?
Really? - Yeah. We'll get a suite.
you could call Toothbrush Girl.
I think I'd rather be sodomized with a toothbrush than that.
it's your day, man. We can work something out.
the schematic for these particular shelves is of authors who have slept together and ended up dead or in prison.
no shit?
shit.
see, that's why chicks dig you, man.
no, seriously. They love this freaky poetic crap.
Oh! I ran into Megan yesterday.
she's bartending at Don Hill's tonight, man. Wants us to stop by.
she practically begged me. Yeah, poor thing.
Hey!
Hey! - "Hey," nothing, man! What's...
what?
all right, look, you've been a ghost the past couple of weeks, all right?
you never wanna go out anymore.
I've had enough of this brooding introvert shit, okay?
I'm ready to set up an intervention here.
what?
you do realize that interventions typically don't involve binge drinking.
look, one drink.
okay? Just one. - When was the last time you had one drink?
communion.
Megan! Megan. Wow! You look great!
do not speak.
okay. Two beers?
is she mad at me or something?
she's not mad. That's how people act when they're really into you.
Yeah. - Excuse me?
Oh!
hello. Excuse me. Hi. - Could you get a picture for us?
Yeah, sure. I just push the button?
turn it- You gotta go the other way.
beautiful.
save that for your collection.
so, what are you girls drinking?
mojitos! - Mojitos!
no, no, no, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with any other city.
I'm just saying that this is the greatest city in the world.
all right? I love this street!
I love this street! Where are you guys from?
Miami. - Miami.
that was great. You did it in unison. Miami. That's a big suck fest.
no, this is the greatest city. I don't know, like Barcelona, Rio, - they got nothing on this town. - What are we doing? I'm freezing.
hotel bar. - Michael!
Yeah.
should have worn a coat. - Michael!
it's warm in here. - Get your hands off my car!
what's your problem, asshole?
you'd be warmer if you snuggle up. - Asshole!
what the hell?
get back in your car. - Yeah?
what? - Go back to Long Island - where you come from. - I'm from Queens, asshole!
shut the hell up, Yank.
why don't you go back to England, huh?
Hey, you wanna go back to my hotel room?
that's my bloody guitar! - Eat shit and die!
Whoa!
Tyler- This is messed up.
I'm gonna go. - Tyler!
let's go - Lauren! Where are you going?
come here! - Don't walk over there.
get off me! - Lauren!
get off of me! - Oh, my God!
get off of me!
come on, now! Right now!
hold him down!
no, I really think that it's done.
it's not bleeding as much. - Here you go, ma'am.
I hate New York!
listen, Officer, those two were with us. They were just trying to stop it.
Leo. Cut those two loose.
curly, turn around.
anything in here gonna stab me? - Nope.
get out of jail free.
you're very, very lucky. My partner is on a tear.
how about you two? - It wasn't us, man.
take a hike. - That scumbag kicked my car!
shut up, genius. - Eat shit, wanker!
all right! That's it! Everybody's going!
what? You're bloody shitting me! - Come on!
Hey! Hey! - They attacked us!
these two didn't do anything.
it was everything was these assholes. - Hey, star witness, shut up!
what are you still doing here?
this is bullshit. These two guys were just walking across the street.
well, Mr. Hawkins, what makes you think I give a shit?
cause you're a cop.
you're supposed to give a shit. - You hear that, Leo?
that's a great relief to me, Mr. Hawkins, to know that you're on top of the situation.
now, go home!
take a hike, fellas. - Why don't you...
what...
Hey, pretty boy, you ready to grab your ankles?
come here, sweet potato.
you can have your call now.
no, I'm good. I'm good. Don't worry about it.
you all right? - You're good?
you're good?
okay. Now, thank God you're good.
cause I wouldn't want you to get upset about anything, like being in jail.
l wouldn't want you to worry about that.
you want to tell me what you were doing?
l would like to know. You wanna tell me what you wanted from that cop guy?
nothing. It was just a messed-up situation. I mean...
Yeah, I'll say, it was frigging stupid, is what it was.
these guys, you know, they're just pussies.
you pussies!
that's great. That's good. Okay, Green Hornet... Lantern.
asshole!
you know what? You might actually be having a nice time not matriculating in school. But I actually would like to graduate.
it must be nice living at the bookstore by yourself with all your stacks of books and all that, but, see, I actually plan on having a career, and a wife, and a girlfriend, and, I don't know, a divorce and a mid-life stalking episode, and erectile dysfunction.
little bitch! - Shut up!
faggot! - Asshole!
so I will thank you, as a friend- Shut up!
to keep your complexes and your nihilistic bullshit to yourself!
did you just say "nihilistic"? - Yeah! All right? I got it off a cereal box!
Hawkins. Hall.
Oh, you- Yeah.
I called your dad. Sue me.
good boy. - We didn't do anything!
Hey, nice to meet you.
is she looking for a roommate?
in the city?
Really?
Hey, I gotta go, but I'll call you back.
okay. Bye.
so, what'd you tell me you were gonna do when things got tight?
what, breathe?
did you? - I did. I'm breathing right now.
who was that? - Marie.
Oh.
how is she? - She's good.
Mrs. Lippman's gonna drive me.
no. I'll drive you.
Hey.
this drive is too long.
you know you can't smoke in here.
why do you have an ashtray?
it's a bowl. It completes the room.
this is a bowl?
well, I'm sorry. - Tyler.
I guess it was just here to tease me.
Hey, Janine. - He's ready for you.
you okay? - Yeah.
Really? - Yeah, I'm fine, Janine.
you look like hell, and you smell like beer and cigarettes.
thank you. - You want me to lie to you?
try not to give him a heart attack.
I only came to see how much it cost. I'm gonna pay you back.
how much what costs? - The lawyer.
Ah.
that lawyer, Tyler, costs $450 an hour.
Oh, for Christ sake.
tell me about it.
I just wanted you to know that I didn't call you.
it wasn't me.
you could do worse than have a father who bails you out of jail.
that's not even...
I don't want to be bailed out of anything.
I'll get an invoice from Janine.
Hey, Michael, remember that Greek myth you read to me about the god who banished all his children to the underworld, and how his youngest son, to get even, castrated him with a sickIe?
it's a little excessive, maybe, but I get it.
you're so weird.
Caroline, we have to go to surgery right now.
what did you do to your face?
I had a horrible threshing accident.
it was horrible. - It was so horrible.
the worst. - You're so retarded.
Hey, I got you something.
this is my favorite book, ever.
michael used to hit me over the head repeatedly with it until I read it.
it's about all these gods and goddesses who go around acting jealous and petty, and otherwise like regular human beings.
illustrations are pretty cool. - Yeah. These are cool.
Thanks.
uh...
where are we meeting Mom? - The Guggenheim.
what's up with these girIs?
they think I'm weird.
sometimes I sort of space out.
what, when you're drawing?
Yeah. Other times, too.
Mademoiselle Fleishman had to snap her fingers at me a lot today, and everybody laughed.
they all think I'm a freak of nature.
Mademoiselle Fleishman.
freak of nature.
french toast.
what are you gonna tell Mom about your face?
I finally found something I'm good at? - Really?
I have a class now. - I know.
are you listening? I have a class now. - I know by all numerical measurements, I didn't pass.
but I was hoping that maybe you could give me a grade on my trying-to-pass, my commitment to effort. It's...
my commitment to commitment. You know?
I don't... Look, I'm not... I mean...
Patricia. Can I call you Patricia? - No.
I... Life is about people and...
and it's about what people put into people. And I wanna put something into you.
and l... Not... I don't wanna...
I won't put anything into you. I just wanna... You look great. I love that jacket.
I will... I will say you're an angel, Patricia! An angel!
he has got a daughter!
who's got a daughter? - The cop!
the cop that busted your face all up. He's got a daughter.
what do you want me to do? Kidnap her?
of course not! We don't have closet space for that.
just introduce yourseif. You know, go on a few dates. I don't know.
be your charming, gentlemanly self, and then flip the script on her.
what's "flip the script"? - Screw her brains out.
make her call you Daddy, I don't know.
just steal her panties and sell them on eBay, or post them on her high school's home page.
I don't know. Just be creative.
Yeah, you should be incarcerated just on general principle.
I was incarcerated. You might remember? - Yeah.
you tell me you don't wanna get back at this asshole, and I'll drop it.
Where's the trash?
I don't wanna get back at this asshole.
just meet her. - I don't wanna meet her.
she's cute. - I don't care.
you're meeting her. - No, I'm not.
Yeah, you are. - No, I'm not.
are, too.
look, just meet her.
this is one of those things that I'm already regretting.
all right, she was here the other day.
I don't care. What do you want me to say?
Hey, doll face, your dad trampled all over my civil liberties.
you wanna make out with me?
don't call her "doll face"!
moron.
look, I'm leaving. - Would you...
look. All right, there she is.
who? - The blonde.
I know her. She's...
I don't know her, but she's in my global politics class.
there you go! Something to open up with. All right?
go get her.
excuse me? Can I bother you for a sec?
you're already bothering me.
listen, I'm doing this sociological experiment, and I was just wondering if you could help me out for a second.
you're kidding me, right?
can I ask your name?
anonymous.
anonymous. Is that Greek?
okay. Anonymous, you see the guy sitting over there, pretending to read a textbook, looking in this general direction?
Yeah, he's staring at us. Subtle.
I have this theory that an objective third party such as yourself could determine how much of an asshole he is just by looking at him.
see, I'm his roommate, and I think I've witnessed too many glaring examples of assoholic behavior that I'm biased as a subject.
but I'm convinced that he has an aura that you can actually perceive.
who eIse do you plan on asking?
I don't know. I don't think anybody else here fits the criteria.
attractive, early-twenties female...
Ah! Nineteen. - Nineteen. I'm...
that's fine. Teens. I can do teens.
okay.
well, typically, you get something for being involved in one of these surveys.
I ran out of my foam fingers a while back, so...
I don't know, can I take you out to dinner or something?
or maybe just have a conversation on the off-chance one of us says something interesting?
Yeah, see, there is a problem, though, because I don't date sociology majors.
lucky for you, I'm undecided. So...
about what?
everything.
I'm Ally.
ally.
don't be mad!
dad, we've seen Ern Brockovich twice already. You cried both times.
I did not. - It's embarrassing.
Hello? - Hello.
Hey, it's Tyler. - Hi.
you're gonna stand me up. I can feel it.
I can feel it in my bones. I'm gonna be devastated.
no, no... I was just...
what? You were sitting around watching TV in your sweatpants?
no, I'm not watching TV.
I am just getting dressed and I'm gonna meet you at the place at...
what time again? - 8: 00.
right. 8: 15. Okay.
remind me. - Ern Brockovich.
car accident. Not her fauit, she says.
Hey, I'm going out.
I can see that.
well, you are a trained investigator.
who are you going with? - A boy from school.
okay.
I wasn't asking for permission. - I know. Just have a good time.
you want cab fare?
should I wait up?
what desserts do you have?
mango ice cream with nuts and raisins.
great. I'll have that and a glass of skim milk.
and then the lamb vindaloo. Thanks.
can I have a chicken tikka masala and a Kingfisher, please?
I have my dessert first.
Oh!
is that a political statement?
or a medical condition, perhaps?
I just don't see the point in waiting. What if I die eating my vindaloo?
is that probable? - It's possible.
embolism bursts, asteroid hits the restaurant.
I'd die without having eaten the one thing I wanted most.
I mean, the odds are- Tell you what. Guarantee me, swear to me on your eternal soul that I make it through my entrée, and I'll wait.
before you answer, if I die, you're gonna have to live the rest of your life knowing not only did you lie to me, but you denied me of my one last indulgence.
my last wish.
are you prepared to shoulder that kind of responsibility to prove a point?
don't worry. I'll share.
I had a nice time.
yeah?
you had a nice time, or you're having a nice time?
cause if you're having a nice time, why rush to end it?
take a shot. Three for one. $1.
okay, come on. Win a prize. Win a prize for the pretty lady.
Yeah. I want the panda.
how many do you need to get for the panda?
three for three.
let's go. - I knew that.
almost.
Yeah. Give me three more.
if I give up, he wins.
who? The attendant? - The giant freaking panda.
take it easy, tough guy.
I'm sorry. All right, three more. Three more. Let's do it.
that's another $1 .
Yeah, I don't know what you're smiling about.
I won.
paying off the attendant is not winning. It's cheating.
by the way, when were you gonna tell me what the hell happened to your face?
I just got into a bar fight.
do you want to go for a beer or something?
no, wait, you can't. You're too young.
I'm 21 .
no, you're not. You're...
did you lie?
I was trying to get rid of you. - Oh.
that hurts. I'm wounded.
well, it's getting pretty late, so...
I'll walk you to the subway.
I'll take a cab. I never take the subway anyway.
okay.
Thanks. - Yeah.
so...
uh...
not tonight. - Okay.
not never, just not tonight.
are we going or what? - Turn on the meter.
not never?
so dessert first, for fear of asteroid, yes, but kissing a guy you seem to be attracted to, at least, before driving off into the unknown New York City night alongside a panda you only just met, no?
great.
good.
you're really weird. - Yeah, I know.
I'm going to Queens. Don't wanna hear about it.
Hello, this is Jackie Mason. Buckle up...
happy end of 6th grade! - Finally.
I got into that art program summer thing at Steinhardt.
Yeah, I heard.
it's very prestigious, due to my artistic greatness.
Mmm...
don't pretend you're not proud. You should be.
there's, like, a thing. - A thing?
a show where you show what you've done and stuff.
will you come?
um...
I'll have to check my book.
Abso-freaking-lutely. What, are you insane?
I'm gonna be there the day before.I'm gonna camp out.
your school's over, right?
mom and Les are gonna get the beach house again?
Yeah.
what are we gonna do for your birthday? - Nothing.
can we have a party? - No.
a little one. At Mom's, with Aidan.
I'll make Mom behave. No crying. - Like that's even possible.
I know. We live like pigs.
but
I do have a coaster, if you want a coaster.
don't do coasters till the third date.
Hey, who's that?
that's Michael. That's my brother.
he kind of looks like you.
does he play around here? - Not anymore.
do you play?
well, it depends who you ask.
it turns out that you need talent.
so, what talents do you actually possess, Tyler?
not a lot. I, uh...
I used to do a bit of falconry when I was a kid.
I mean, I come from a long line of Irish falconers.
no, there is...
Oh!
I don't know if this qualifies as a talent, but...
what is that? - This is our appetizer.
I mean, it used to say, "In case of Asteroid,"
but Aidan, my roommate, got high, and I was in the shower.
so...
what kind of grade did you get from Vogelstein?
I don't really get grades.
I'm not technically enrolled. I just worked out this auditing thing.
huh.
so the Strand isn't a significant career choice, either?
no, I just like the books.
what are you doing?
you don't need to help me. - Yeah, well, at the rate you're going, dishwashing's gonna be, like, your life's vocation.
what?
huh.
so, this is the whole playful "you get me all wet" part, right?
why make it sound cheap? - It is cheap. I've seen this scene 100 times.
you know what never happens in this scene, though,
Tyler who doesn't really go to school?
Tyler who doesn't really care about his job?
what? - Nope?
that.
you better apologize!
Never! - Apologize!
your middle name is Keats? God, your parents are pretentious as hell.
you better apologize. - Never!
apologize! - I'd rather eat monkeys!
Oh, God. Not in the plans! Not in the plans!
I surrender. I surrender. Jeez.
you're relentless.
victory at all costs. - Oh, man...
now I'm pissed.
you should quit anyway.
why is that? Are cigarettes bad for you or something?
do you want a sweatshirt or something?
I'm okay. Thanks.
you know, the only time I ever smoked was at the roller disco at the Y.
l choked so bad, Mr. Demmick gave me the Heimlich.
on skates? That's actually quite impressive.
I never really thought of it that way.
tattoo, huh? Let me see. What is it, like a Chinese character or something?
cause I know this guy who got a Chinese character, and he thought it said...
sorry. I didn't know.
he killed himseif.
when?
when?
on his 22nd birthday.
he'd just started working for my father.
I thought he was a musician.
Yeah, he was.
but he wasn't making any money. And...
my dad's a pretty compelling guy.
Yeah. So is mine.
damn, you're not naked! - You're not Irish.
what the hell happened in the kitchen?
it looks like somebody's water broke in there. It's gross.
Hi. - Hi.
Aidan, this is Ally.
ally, Ally... - Ally, Aidan. This is my roommate.
nice to meet you.
I work out. - You're the assoholic.
Yeah. Well, I...
wait. What?
okay, "Around The World" party, third floor. Come on, let's go.
there's a whole lot of ugly, but there's a lot more alcohol, so...
come on, let's go.
Yeah, I would, I'd love to, but I should get home.
what? No, no, no. All right, listen, listen, listen.
ally? Ally, Ally?
one drink.
any country you want. I'll even put "France" on the table.
come on. And then we'll go.
one drink?
one drink? - One drink.
how are we doing?
what?
what? What do you want me to say? You want me to say I'm sorry?
you want me to apologize for showing a nice girl a good time?
I'm sorry. - Tyler,
I need you to call my dad.
Yeah, sure. Where's your phone?
ally, your phone's dead.
ally?
what's his number?
God damn.
do you think I give a shit how late it is?
I know she's a smart girl, Leo. She's supposed to be back. She's not back.
Leo, don't go there. All right?
I want... I want you to call Ted Proferes!
Yeah. And call me back.
God damn it, just do it!
Oh, shit.
shit!
I'm sorry. I fell asleep.
asleep where?
my phone died, so...
that's mine. That's from my desk. - I was trying to find some information.
what am I now, one of your suspects?
when you act like one. Are you on anything?
Oh, for God's sake. - Don't use that tone with me, Ally.
I smell alcohol.
Yeah, so do I.
what's going on here, Ally? Are you trying to tell me something with this?
you're all grown up now?
Yeah, maybe it's time you get used to it, dad, before you give yourseif a heart attack.
who's the guy?
God, what makes you think there's a guy? - Yeah, he's a real prince.
he gets you drunk, sends you home smelling like a brewery, smelling like God knows what.
you sure can pick them. - Yeah, I take after my mother.
I'm not a child, okay? - Hey! In this house, you are!
you'd love that!
you're pathetic! Would you strangle me 'cause you couldn't save mom...
ally? Ally?
don't touch me! Don't...
so, what? She just left? No goodbye?
you were the one dumping Jell-O shots down her throat.
Hey, there are sins of omission and sins of commission.
I've forgiven myself, okay? You should do the same.
all right, here we go.
come on! Come on!
here we go! Here we go!
got it! Okay!
okay... don't think I can...
crushing!
it's crushing! I need a little help here! Tyler!
what the hell, man? - It's penance.
I'm going to work.
help!
well, if you had another one of those protein shakes...
Yeah, but it was freaking crushing my sternum, you jackass.
Hey.
how's she doing?
she's pretty shaken up.
we need to fix that deadbolt.
Yeah. That's my bad.
don't worry about it. Do you think she's gonna sleep?
you know, you realize if she'd had the S. L.U. T...
is it too soon?
I told her she can stay here. Is that all right?
Yeah. As long as she needs. - Thank you.
the fans let him know how they feel about it.
hide the women and children. This could get ugly.
this crowd does nothing to hide its anger over this latest debacle.
the fans are mad as hell. They don't want to take it anymore.
they seem to be blaming Dixon, a good fighter, for the decline not only of the heavyweight-division guys, but of the entire sport.
they're actually pelting the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world with ice.
maybe this angry, visceral reaction will pressure Dixon to fight someone who can fight back for a change. If there's somebody out there.
all of boxing is hoping for a warrior who thrills us with his passion.
time goes by too fast.
yeah? Not fast enough.
your kid should've been here. - That's all right.
no, it ain't all right. - The kid gets a little busy sometimes.
he don't get that busy.
let's not talk about it here, okay? You're coming tonight, right?
I'm working. I took the tour the last three years.
I know, but it's the anniversary.
fine. You got my word.
I appreciate it, thank you. I owe you, Paulie.
yo, Robert. What's going on? Where have you been? You're late.
no. I don't wanna hear this. Look, your job performance is nowhere near good enough to be pulling this.
I don't give a damn who your father is. You understand me?
all right. Now get out of here. - Okay.
thank you, sir.
yo, Robert. Yo.
Hey, Rocky. - Hey.
Hey, how you doing? - Hey.
what's up, champ?
you caught me off guard. - I know.
I wanted to catch you before you got busy.
Yeah, it gets busy up there.
so how you doing? Yeah? - Real good. Yeah.
yo, Rock! - Yeah, how you doing?
Yeah, real good.
listen, you wanna go out and get some coffee?
I'm kind of behind. Maybe later?
Yeah. That'd be great. You ought to come by the restaurant tonight.
I can have something made special for you.
tonight I can't. I got plans. A few of the guys get together.
did I do something wrong? - What do you mean?
well, I don't know exactly what I mean...
...but I just think, like, when I come here, you don't feel so comfortable.
and I certainly don't wanna do that.
well, you throw a big shadow. - A big shadow?
you're not gonna get anything done down here, Robert.
well, if you're not gonna introduce me, I will. Hi, I'm William Tomilson.
how you doing? - Your son works for me.
it's a good job. - Yeah.
I've told Robert about 20 times that I wanted to meet you.
you're pretty busy, which isn't a bad thing.
I get a little tied up. - Grab a shot, will you?
I may not get this chance again. Old warhorses have to stick together.
the old horses, yeah. - I'll tell you.
good thing it's not your left. - This makes you popular with people.
one, two, three. - Finally, we get to meet.
I gotta get going. It was nice to meet you face to face.
you take care of yourself. Robert, I'll see you later.
I gotta get going. I'll change my plans for tonight.
that'd be great. I'm looking forward to it.
how you doing? - Okay.
okay. - All right.
and do not let those numbers drive you crazy.
too late. - Use an eraser, get rid of all of them.
yo, Rock. - Hey, guys.
Hey, Rock. - Hey, how you doing?
there you go.
it'll be about 10 tenths. You guys take care, okay? You got it.
I'll try a few of these later on.
it's good for baking. - How much...?
yo, Paul, what's the cost? - 58. 40, sir.
all right, take it out of that. I trust you.
how you doing? - You're too generous.
not a problem.
how you guys doing?
how we doing, Isabel?
okay, except for the freebie reading the Bible.
he's okay. - Just because you fought him...
...don't mean you gotta feed him. He doesn't look like a fighter.
spider Rico could hit.
listen, how's your stomach? - It's okay.
if you keep rubbing olive oil on your stomach, your kid's gonna be born very strong.
okay, Rocky. Whatever you say. - No, really.
yo, how you doing, Spider? - God bless you, Rocky.
Thanks.
how you guys doing?
jose, can you make something special for my kid who's coming tonight?
no problem.
good. I appreciate it.
back and forth, back and forth, give and take.
and then I went in there like an animal and threw him into the corner...
and I unloaded everything I had. Hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.
but Creed, he kept busting me back pretty good...
and the agony began to pile up.
then I heard the best sound that I ever heard in my life...
the bell. - That's right, the bell.
I ain't never been so tired, and I'm sitting in my corner.
I'm trying to figure out how to survive the last round...
when Mickey leans into my ear and says:
come on, get out there and fight this guy hard, you bum.
"you gotta be first. You gotta be first." I said, "Yo, Mick, if I could..."
I would. I would.
the end.
yet another quick knockout for Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.
the fans let him know how they feel about it.
they're actually pelting the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world with ice.
Hello, Adrian's. Yeah?
tell him you can't make it? Yeah, I'll give him the message.
I just kept hearing Mickey's voice in my head over and over again.
I just dug down, and before you know it...
it was toe to toe and it was... Excuse me.
your son said he can't make it. He said he'll take a rain check. Okay?
look at these birds.
don't these birds look like candy? Flying candy?
Hey, birdie, you wanna fly me home?
you need somebody to walk you home?
no?
it's a cold night. We need a few laughs in our life. What do you think? Maybe?
maybe? Maybe?
okay. Let's get out of here, okay?
that place ain't changed much from last year.
are we done?
Hey, how you doing, Mick?
that sign is falling apart, Paulie.
the whole world is falling apart. Look at us.
don't talk crazy, Paulie.
you know, I think if you live someplace long enough, you are that place.
I ain't no talking building.
come on, it's getting late, Rock.
I get a headache from this train.
I remember when she was standing there...
all nervous and shy, with this little smile.
and all I wanted her to do was trust me.
she did.
she did. - You done?
how long are we staying here? - Not long.
well, I'm glad they tore this ice rink down.
come on.
you heard me. I'm happy they tore it apart.
first time I walked your sister across this ice, we was over there.
she was nervous, but I wasn't so great on the blades either.
ice is stupid. People standing on ice are more stupid.
and over there, when she was falling...
and my hand grabbed her
and I got her arm through that coat, I could feel it.
electric.
you said the same thing last year, Rock.
did I?
so you better develop your brain.
you're left-handed. - Absolutely.
come on, Rock. Let's go.
we're done. There's no place to sit down around here.
it's all right.
it ain't all right! It's depressing and freaking cold!
what's the matter with you, Paulie?
you're living backwards, Rocko!
change the channel from yesterday! Yesterday wasn't so great!
it was to me. - Not to me!
you treated her good. You had the good times.
I treated her bad. I don't have to think about this.
she always loved you, Paulie.
sorry, Rocko, I can't do this no more.
can I help you?
no, No, I used to come down to this place a long time ago.
I was just looking around. No big deal.
can I get you a drink?
all right. Maybe just a short beer. - Okay.
go. Go on.
Yeah, go on. Get him to buy a round.
get him to buy a round. Go.
get him to pay. He's got it. He's spending money.
listen, I don't mean to cross the line or anything...
but I read about your wife's passing a few years back.
Yeah, it was woman cancer.
Yeah. I always heard she was a nice person.
Yeah, the best.
do I know you? - We met a long time ago.
we did?
when I was a kid, you walked me home.
I did? - Told me to stop smoking and things.
stop smoking...
are you Little Marie that used to hang out at that Atomic Hoagie shop?
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, now I remember. I walked you home.
when you got there, you turned around and said, "Screw you, creepo."
I didn't say that. - Yeah, you did.
you sure? - Great insults last a long time.
yo! Yo, is that you? Is that really you?
how you doing? - I think he wants to drink alone.
well, then give him his drink, then. I ain't stopping you.
what's that, your man or something? No, I don't think so.
anyway, me and my friends, we're right down there.
think you could buy us a round? You got the money. Just one round.
Hey. Thank you.
what are you doing pushing my hand away like that?
what's your name? - Angie. What do you wanna know for?
don't be playing a fool for that guy. - A fool?
Yeah. - A fool?
I'm the fool? You're the fool, not me!
you got it twisted. You're the fool. I'm a person, just like you.
you ain't no better than me. You think you're a big shot now? You're nothing.
you ain't no better than me. No better!
glad you dropped in?
I think the neighborhood is changing a little.
what was that all about? - I don't know. Forget about it.
I'm gonna lock up, so if you wanna take off, I'll tally everything up.
Yeah, thanks. - How you doing, Rock?
I'm good, thanks.
you live around here? - About eight blocks from here.
eight blocks.
you need a lift?
all right.
did you ever get married?
Yeah, sort of. - Sort of?
Yeah, well, he took off. - Poof, just like that?
Yeah, just like that.
you sort of have any kids? - Yeah, I got one kid.
yeah? Me too. Me too. Wonderful boy.
Hey, tough guy! What's the matter, you can't buy a round?
the girl was being nice to your dumb ass.
what you doing with that pig? - Think you can disrespect us?
she ain't nothing but a jealous bitch! - Come on back!
Hey, don't listen to them.
both of you, you ain't no better than me.
come over here, you'll get your head kicked in around here.
you punch-drunk, goofy bastard. - You ain't no big shot, look at you.
you ain't even got a car to take that pig home.
you all right?
Yeah.
what are you doing? Don't get out. It's all right.
no, Little Marie. It ain't all right.
yo. - What?
I'll tell you what. Get inside.
you get inside. Yeah, you. - Hey, leave him alone!
yo, man! - See it?
you see that? You see that? - Yeah. All right.
what do you say? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
get a job!
that guy sends his apologies.
okay.
Martin. Martin. Yo, Martin!
I see you still got your key.
Yeah, I got a key. You got time to talk?
I got a lot of time since your people let me go.
you know I had nothing to do with that.
Yeah.
Yeah, we moved in about a year ago.
yeah? - Yeah, I mean, it's only temporary.
Yeah, I could see that. - I'm gonna look for an apartment.
apartments are nice.
Yeah. It is what it is, you know.
Yeah, it is what it is.
this place used to be pretty nice. There's a lot of history around here.
Yeah. - Like down the street...
it is the Cambria Fight Club.
they used to call it the Bucket of Blood.
I took some massive beatings there. But it was nice. Good memories.
and I heard these buildings are like, I don't know, 100, 150 years old.
if I was 150 years old, I'd be falling apart too. So it's okay, building.
does that light work?
no, it's burnt out or something. Yeah. - Yeah?
listen, thanks for the ride, and I'm sorry about those guys.
some of those guys just got their brains on backwards and stuff.
what's he doing out so late? - Is that your kid?
Yeah. Wish he wouldn't stay out so late.
amazing. - Yeah, what's that?
last time I seen you, you was a kid...
and now you officially got one of your own.
it's amazing.
you know, he sort of resembles you. He's got that big Irish hair.
Yeah, it's the other one.
yeah? - His father was from Jamaica.
Jamaica? European.
was you on a cruise ship or something?
no, not really. - What's his name?
steps. Short for Stevenson. - Makes sense.
does he look mad at me, or is it maybe the angle I'm standing at?
no. He's a good kid.
you wanna meet him? - It's getting kind of late.
I got so many things to do. - Yeah, yeah, I understand.
thanks again for the ride and everything else.
I'll see you.
you too.
Hey, Steps, come on. Let's go. Say good night to your friend.
what are you doing out in the cold with no hat on?
did you get something to eat? - Yeah, I already ate.
all right.
you're late, you know. - I can take care of myself.
yo, Little Marie!
ain't you gonna introduce me to your kid?
how you doing, Steps? - What's up?
listen, I got this place, this restaurant, nice little eatery not too far from here.
what's all this junk? Got a tissue.
sometimes I feel like a kangaroo, all the stuff in my pocket, you know.
here you go. I got a card, there it is.
and if you ever get a chance, it'd be great...
...if both of youse come down there and eat.
it'd be great, free. You know. Anyway, I'll leave it over there... Here.
I'll leave it on the steps. Steps.
see you later.
come on, let's go.
you've known what's best for you since you were 10.
since you walked in here alone.
got everything money can buy except what it can't.
it's pride. Pride is what got your ass out of here.
losing is what brung you back.
but people like you, they need to be tested. Need a challenge.
that ain't gonna happen. Ain't nothing out there.
there's always somebody out there. Always.
when that time comes and you find something standing in front of you that ain't running that ain't backing up, hitting on you, and you're too damn tired to breathe...
you find that situation on you, that's good.
because that's baptism under fire.
you get through that, you find the only kind of respect...
that matters in this damn world: Self-respect.
Thanks, Martin. I appreciate that.
now, what can the champ do for you?
you can give me some of that money you got.
you know, I like you, Martin. - But not that much.
exactly.
how about a picture with the kid? All right?
sure.
here, son, hold up your fist. Makes you look more hazardous.
there you go. - Thanks, Rock.
enjoy your meal.
he's a nice guy, isn't he? - Rocky?
Yeah. - Spider just went downstairs.
I don't know if that's all right. - What's he doing?
I don't know. That's your friend.
yo, Spider!
let me do some dishes. I feel better. - Come on. You're my guest.
let me do something. - Keep eating. Guests do that.
don't make me fight you again. Last time you got lucky.
lucky? Okay.
Jesus wants me to work.
yo, Rocky. - Yeah?
you've got guests.
don't get too wet, okay?
glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.
you kept the card.
Yeah, I kept the card.
why don't you sit down? - Yeah, sure.
because, you know what, I walk in there, I say good morning, I do this:
tonight, boxing once again.
two contrasting styles in almost every way.
Hey, can you turn this up? Turn this up, please.
who was the best of all time? If two athletes from different eras...
who could compete against one another, who would come out on top?
given the same rules, using the same equipment, who was the greatest?
we feed our facts into the computer.
they weigh in on who they think will reign supreme while fielding the comments of our illustrious panel of sportswriters.
champion!
yo, champion! - Yeah?
come check out this trash they're talking about you, man!
what you talking about? - Come check this out. Hurry up.
tonight, the former two-time heavyweight champion from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa.
all right, Chuck Johnson, USA Today?
there's no question that Rocky Balboa fought tougher fights during a tougher era in boxing.
you look at Mason Dixon in his career...
he's basically been spoon-fed his opponents.
no question in my mind. Not only does Rocky win but he wins knockout.
Rocky!
offspring.
bernard Fernandez?
Dixon is a victim of his own dominance.
he's never been in real knockdown-dragout brawls.
he never had to dig down to rally back.
if he tries to dig down against Balboa...
he'll find he doesn't have a big enough shovel.
I clearly give it to Balboa.
what happened to you? What happened to you?
boxing historian Burt Randolph Sugar.
Dixon has fought cream puffs. We don't know what he's made of.
but both in their primes, you gotta factor in...
Dixon's unbelievable speed...
his slashing offense. He cuts Balboa to bits.
no doubt. Dixon wins all the way.
here's where our subjectivity ends. Let's see what the computer says.
Dixon unloads on Balboa. Rocky has no answer. Balboa is eating jabs.
what time is it? - Mason time.
what time is it? - Mason time.
what time is it? - Mason time.
now Dixon is done. He is reeling. He is almost out on his feet!
Balboa turning up the heat. Pounds him across the ring.
boy, he's bit off more than he can chew this time. Believe it.
Oh, a murderous right hook! And Dixon is out on his feet.
he is out cold as he crumbles to the canvas.
and it is Balboa who has won...
ladies and gentlemen, Baby Rocky. Baby Rocky.
I'm glad you liked the food. If you heat that up, it's pretty good in the morning.
Yeah, thanks, man.
nice kid. I hope this music ain't giving you a headache. I like this old stuff.
no, I like it. It's nice.
well, good. Good.
yo, you think Steps wants a job? Make a few bucks on the weekend?
it's good making your own money. My kid stashed a few bucks doing that.
why are you being so nice?
I don't want you to think nothing's off, you know.
my wife, she's gone, but she ain't. You know what I mean?
Yeah, well, I wasn't thinking that. Believe me.
no? Then what was you thinking? - No.
that you don't owe us nothing. What are you doing?
be patient.
now...
I don't owe you nothing, but why do you gottaowe something to get...?
bingo.
why do you gotta owe something to get something, you know? Really.
I think hanging out with your kid would be nice. What do you think?
I think that'd be nice.
good. That's very nice.
I'm glad you come by.
it was nice watching you eat.
good company.
yo, Little Marie. Let there be light!
you like dogs? - Dogs?
dogs. This is like a dog pound. It's where they keep a large variety of dogs. I used to come here all the time for sightseeing.
but, you know, you learn a lot talking to dogs.
really, you do. - Yeah, man. So...
Hey, man, how about this one?
he don't look too friendly, my friend.
man, this is the one. Hey, boy, how you doing?
Hey, what about this one here? Come here, boy.
who, him? - Yeah, why not?
hell, no. That is one ugly dog, man.
I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly. If you look at it closely, the color...
it looks like old furniture, like some kind of pirate-chest thing going on.
Yeah, sure, man. Hey, so how about a young one?
steps, forget him. Come over here. I want you to see something.
now, you notice what this animal is doing here? Lying in that position?
he ain't doing nothing.
no, he's doing a lot. He ain't wasting no energy.
because he's dead.
he ain't dead. There's a lot of good mileage left on that animal.
good food, the addition of a couple of new friends, bingo, he's back.
what do you think is a good name? - It's your dog. You name him.
no. It's, like, a community animal. Fifty-fifty.
look, I don't know much about no dogs.
well, it ain't that complicated.
you pet him, you feed him, and nature takes its course.
you know, so... Don't you wanna name an animal?
every guy should at one time try to name an animal something.
I don't know. Fleabag?
it's catchy. It ain't original, but it's pretty good.
I think you could come up with, in your young brain...
something better to throw out than Fleabag.
punchy. How's that?
punchy? - Yeah, Punchy.
I like it, you know. - For real?
Yeah, for real. Punchy it is. It's easy to remember, it's not that hard to spell.
and once it's in your brain, you never forget it. Punchy. Very good.
all right, man. - Good call.
all right, Punchy. You ready to get bailed out, my friend?
okay.
Hey, you know it was a joke, don't you?
Yeah, I know. You're a very funny guy.
Rocky?
the fans let him know how they feel about it.
excuse me. - Sure.
this could get ugly.
rock. - Yo, Paulie.
they're gonna be talking about that fake Looney Tune fight.
Hey, come on. We're about to serve today's special.
italian food cooked up by a bunch of Mexicans ain't so special.
Hey, yo.
Hey, I skipped work for this.
what an ugly dog.
it's a cute dog.
Hey, Rock. - Yeah?
I'm gonna take off. That stuff back there is pretty cool.
Oh, you like that? - Yeah, man.
Thanks, I appreciate it. - I'll catch you later.
all right.
who's the criminal? - He's a nice kid.
he dresses like a bum.
coming from a human hamper, that's quite a compliment.
hide the silverware.
that's nice.
Hey, Spider.
didn't you knock out that bum once?
will you give it a rest?
I'm gonna be late for work for this. Give me a break, huh?
all right. Just for a few seconds.
in the late '60s, a simulated fight took place between two legends...
muhammad Ali and Rocky Marciano.
Marciano long retired, and Ali unable to fight legitimately...
for three years for having refused induction into the armed forces...
he was in need of money, and agreed to the dream match whose outcome would be decided by a computer.
it's almost 35 years since Rocky Marciano won the much-disputed computer decision and guess what? Not much has changed.
last week, Rocky Balboa won a decisive fight...
see? That's the cartoon fight I'm telling you about.
Yeah.
a stunning knockout.
keep in mind, this is taking the human factor out of it.
the computer says Balboa... - Beautiful.
......would be triumphant, KO 13. And here's some of the fallout:
what started as a simple form of entertainment...
...has become a rallying cry for people who think .an old-school athlete like Balboa could actually be better.
computer technology has to create what isn't. That's just not responsible.
get therapy, will you?
how do you think Balboa would have done against Dixon?
badly. Personally, I think Balboa was completely overrated.
he owns a restaurant in South Philly.
what's the specialty, pounded chicken?
anyway, I would have paid to see the fight. Next topic, NAS CAR and the controversy that won't go away.
let's go back to Sunday's race...
Hey, hey, hey, cheer up.
it's free advertisement. Come on. Meat house calls.
yo, Robert.
what are you doing out so late?
I tried calling, but nothing was picking up.
is something wrong? - I just wanted to come by...
...and see you in person. - Wanna come inside?
no. I just wanna get your opinion on something.
sure. Opinion on what?
you know, they say you only go around once, right?
Yeah, I've heard that. - Well...
...I think I wanna, like, do something.
like what? - Fight.
you know, nothing big. Small stuff, like locally. You know.
don't you think you're too, you know, old?
you think you ought to stop trying things...
...because you had a few too many birthdays? I do not.
people will think you're crazy.
what's crazy about standing toe to toe saying, "I am," you know?
that's just ego talking.
what are you trying to prove to other people, Pop?
prove? Listen, I stopped thinking the way other people think a long time ago.
you gotta think like you think.
I do. - Do you? Good.
you gotta face reality, okay? It's a different world now.
only the clothes is different.
I really don't know what you want from me.
I just wanted us to get involved. You know, like, home team.
look, whatever it is, whatever you're going through, it'll pass.
Yeah, you're probably right.
time is gonna catch up to all of us.
especially if you're standing still. - Hey, come on.
look, I'm gonna call you in the morning.
did you tell this to your kid? - Yeah, I did.
What'd he think, you're nuts, right? - Yeah.
Oh, well, he don't believe in you? Welcome to my world, buddy.
Rocko, nobody's giving you no title shot.
I know that. I don't want one.
so this isn't a mental disturbance?
no.
you're mad because they took down your statue?
no.
not really, no.
if it's about money, just hang a sign around your neck saying, "Punch me.
five dollars, you'll make big money.
what? You haven't peaked yet?
peaked? - Yeah, peaked.
I don't know. There's still some stuff in the basement.
what basement? - In here.
tell me about the stuff.
what about it? - Tell me about the stuff inside.
is it angry? - Angry?
are you mad because Adrian left you?
she didn't leave, Paulie. She died.
okay. Okay, okay, okay.
you know, sometimes it's hard to breathe.
you know, I feel, like, this beast inside me.
it's okay, Rocko. Please, it's okay.
is it okay?
I just never knew it was supposed to be this hard.
it wasn't supposed to be like this, Paulie. You know, it...
so you wanna come by and help me train?
I got a job here.
I understand.
remember you said if you stay one place long enough...
...you become that place?
Rocko, this is all I got.
I understand, Paulie. I do.
if you get time and come down and see me train, I'd appreciate it.
of course, Rocko.
Bye, Paulie.
goodbye, Rocko.
goodbye, Rocko.
take care, Rocko.
this plenary session of the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission convened in order to consider the application of Rocky Balboa for the issuance of a discretionary professional boxing license.
...due to his ineligibility to be licensed as a matter of right.
Mr. Balboa, you're welcome here. Since you're representing yourself...
...we invite you to make an opening statement, if you'd like to.
no, I was just curious how I did, that's all.
all right, well, the Medical Advisory Board has informed us...
...that the battery of tests to which you've been subjected...
...you've passed these tests with flying colors.
and we congratulate you for that.
Thanks. - However, this commission...
...in good conscience, cannot recommend you for a license...
...and we therefore deny your application.
didn't I do what you asked? - Yes, you did.
so I should get a license, right?
not exactly.
so why did you give me all them tests if you was never passing me?
we've gotta stand by our decision here...
...and we have to deny your request for a license at this time.
yo, don't I got some rights?
what rights do you think you're referring to?
like in that official paper they wrote down the street?
that's the Bill of Rights. - Bill of Rights.
don't it say something about going after what makes you happy?
no, that's "the pursuit of happiness." But what's your point?
my point is I'm pursuing something, and nobody looks too happy about it.
but we're just looking out for your interests.
I appreciate that, but maybe you're looking out for your interests more.
you shouldn't ask people to come here and pay the freight on something.
they pay, it still ain't good enough. You think that's right?
maybe you're doing your job, but why you gotta stop me from doing mine?
if you're willing to go through all the battling to get where you want to get...
...who's got the right to stop you?
maybe you got something you never finished, something you wanna do.
something you never said to somebody, something!
and you're told no, even after you pay your dues.
who's got the right to tell you that? Who? Nobody!
it's your right to listen to your gut. It's nobody's right to say no fter you earn the right to be what you wanna be or do what you wanna do!
the older I get, the more things I gotta leave behind. That's life.
the only thing I'm asking you guys to leave on the table is what's right.
yo! Have you seen the paper today?
front row. Front row.
that is so great.
all right, all right. - Let's go get some food. Food.
let's get a beer. Come on. - Come on.
the last two pay-per-views were in the toilet.
you're not making heavyweight-championship money.
there's a bunch of nobodies out there, Mase.
I wanna talk to you about an opportunity we should run with.
look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa applied for a license and got one?
I heard. Forget about him. - Hear me out.
you want me to fight a guy I can beat with both hands tied behind my back.
everybody knows you could beat him sitting down. That's not what it's about.
it's about making money. We gotta capitalize on that computer fight.
this could do a million buys. That's 15, 20 million to you.
forget it. - No one's beating the door down...
...to watch you fight anymore. - We got guaranteed fights.
you wanna do this now in front of your friends, we'll do it now.
we got nothing. All the pay-per-view fights you come up with got rejected.
you know why? They're all bums out there. Nobody cares about them.
there's no market value. But this Balboa thing is interesting.
I don't wanna do it. - Listen to me.
it's a has-been, never-gonna-be world. Call it nostalgia, whatever you want...
...but people relate to that stuff. This is a no-lose. It's all good.
good for who? - For you! Not for me! For you!
maybe you don't understand. People don't like you no more.
they don't follow you. They're not supporting you anymore. Understand?
don't look at me like I'm messing with your legacy.
every jock now thinks they got a legacy.
a legacy is what you get instead of getting paid. That's a legacy.
don't talk to me like I'm stupid. - I'm not no more.
everybody knows you could kick this old man's ass. But you don't.
leave him with a little dignity, so they say:
Mason Dixon's got compassion. He's a decent guy, he's a nice guy.
you get a whole new audience, we'll double your money.
you want a new image? That's how you get it.
to replace the one that you two made?
whoa, wait. We made your world green. You made the rest.
this is you. You made all this junk happen.
I've had it up to here with this mess.
time for me to make changes. I'm going to Martin's gym.
we'll talk about it. - Forget this crap.
I want Martin back. There's nothing to talk about.
how you doing? - Hey, what a surprise.
I was driving around the neighborhood, I thought...
...why not drive by and say hello? - You wanna come inside?
no, the dog needs some exercise. You wanna take a little walk?
Yeah, yeah. All right. - It's nice outside.
all right. - Nice and brisk.
when did you get a dog?
we picked up Punchy a couple of days back.
punchy? - Yeah.
you named your dog Punchy?
your kid come up with the name.
Oh, yeah? I think that's disrespectful.
Oh, no, no. It's fine, really.
no, it's easy to remember and it's all that, you know.
listen, what do you think about coming over to the restaurant?
what for? - Well, you know, for, like...
for work. The hostess is gonna be having a kid. You'd do good.
I don't know. - I'm telling you, you'd do so good.
I appreciate what you're doing for my kid, but I can't.
Hey, listen, I think you'd like it a lot.
it's a nice environment, it's very pleasant.
Yeah, can we drop it?
what's bothering you?
nothing. It's all right. Listen, I gotta get back.
no, it ain't all right. - Oh, come on.
what? - I'm gonna be the first person...
...people see when they walk in? - You give out menus.
you say, "Hello, how are you?" You sit people down.
look, if I can do it, anybody can do it.
you could find 10 better people, a hundred better people for this job.
give it a try, like two weeks.
I don't wanna try.
who put this stuff in your head? - Nobody.
well, it just don't get in there by itself.
thanks for coming by.
yo, when was the last time you went dancing? Has it been a while?
why are you asking? - I'm asking because...
...you dance around these problems, you might as well dance with me.
I ain't that good, but I'm better than the average bear.
where that came from, I don't know.
you're crazy. - A little bit.
but the way you're thinking and talking, it's a little crazy too.
come on, you deserve better. Really. Come on over.
I need you to class my place up. Philly needs you.
and if you say, "Screw you, creepo" again, I totally understand.
but I'm warning you, I'm gonna put myself...
...in the middle of the street here...
...and stand here, me and Punchy, and wave to the first bus, say:
come on over here and mash me!
little Marie turned down the job at the restaurant.
she thinks she's better than us.
Oh, yeah? Well, there hasn't been a bus down here in 20 years.
yeah? - No.
that was a close call.
listen, seriously. Come on over. It'd be nice.
all right.
Paulie!
sorry, Paulie.
sorry.
how are you? Get my unusual up there.
excuse me. Deliveries are in the back.
I'm not a delivery guy.
well, do you have a reservation?
do I look like a freaking Indian?
Hey, Rock? Rocky?
I think we've got a little bit of a problem with this guy.
problem? No, no, he's just a relative.
Oh, okay.
yo, Paulie.
what happened to your eye? - I hit it.
Why? - Needed to.
what happened?
I'm celebrating, Rock. - Why?
I retired. - Retired?
so when did they start giving retired people meat...
...instead of watches, Paulie?
I don't need a watch.
I got a watch! You gave me a watch!
Paulie...
I don't need no goddamn watch.
yo, Paulie. - I got a watch!
I got two watches!
yo, Paulie!
yo, Paulie.
rock.
it takes guts climbing back in that ring, knowing you're gonna take a beating.
you're gonna do all right, Rock.
how do you know that?
the stuff in the basement.
Thanks, Paulie.
Hey. - Hey, Rock, how are you?
you okay? - Yeah, good. How are you?
Yeah, fine. This is great. - Good.
listen, some guys over there wanna talk to you.
okay. You got it. - Okay?
thanks for coming by. I appreciate it. - Our pleasure.
wanna hear stories? - What kind of stories?
well, a lot of people like to hear these old fight stories.
maybe later. - Okay.
I'm Lou DiBella. This is L. C. Luco. He's Mason Dixon's manager.
will you sit down and join us? - Sure.
you know, we have the promotional contract for Mason Dixon...
...who's a big fan. - Really?
when he heard you were interested in fighting...
...he thought why not try to work something out?
like a special event. Like a first-class exhibition fight.
why me? - He respects the hell out of you.
all right? And let's be honest, that computer fight got people curious.
this could be very interesting. - I ain't interested in getting, like, mangled and embarrassed.
no, that's not gonna happen. Never happen.
truthfully, I was thinking more on a, like...
...miniscule, small level. You know. Small fights, not big fights.
small fights. Things that... Local. You know what I mean?
not a bad idea. Don't think of it as big. Think of it like an exhibition.
think of it as a glorified sparring session. Here's something you'll like.
we're gonna donate a portion of the gate to charity.
that's always nice. - It's good to give.
Yeah.
Where's it taking place?
Las Vegas. - Las Vegas.
nice and warm. This cold's gotta be killing you.
little stiff. - You move better when you're warmer.
Yeah. - And if nothing else...
...you'll have new stories to tell.
I really gotta think about this. - Absolutely.
is that okay? - I understand. No problem.
I'm gonna go over there. You can order something.
what do you recommend? - It's all edible.
okay. Thanks.
we got him. Imagine if Dixon met this bastard in his prime?
he'd kill him. Kill him. - You ain't kidding.
man, I'm confused.
I didn't think this was gonna come along.
but this is what you wanted, right?
I don't know. You know, I talk and I talk.
sometimes I think what I'm saying is true...
...and then I look at myself and I'm not even sure what is true anymore.
because it's like, I pushed this crazy idea about fighting.
I mean, what's it all about?
do I really care about standing toe to toe and all that stuff...
...or, like my kid says, is it just, like, ego?
or am I this old pug who's just trying to replace old pain with new pain?
I don't know. I don't know.
look, I know I usually don't say a lot.
I'm always listening and looking.
but who you are, the part of you that's so full of life...
...we all have that feeling, that fire...
...but usually never get a chance to use it. And then it just goes away.
but you can. You've got this opportunity, so do it. Why not?
I mean, this is who you are. This is who you'll always be.
and you don't move aside for nobody until you're ready to move.
and it doesn't matter how this looks to other people.
all that matters is how it looks to you.
rocky.
rocky, look at me.
how it looks to you.
and if this is something that you wanna do...
...and if this is something that you gotta do, then you do it.
fighters fight.
you're not gonna punch me, are you?
listen, I gotta go before I wear out my welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks.
fighters fight, right?
it's rare when you get to promote an event bigger than boxing. This is.
skill versus will, with part of the proceeds going to charity.
the brainchild of Mason Dixon, to honor past heavyweight champions.
warriors like Rocky Balboa. Let's open it up for questions.
Hey, champ!
a few great fighters have fought in their 50s, often with disastrous results.
why risk the danger and embarrassment?
the smart money says you have virtually no chance.
a puncher always has a chance. This fight will be competitive.
