Yeah, I know, and you know what? It was worth it...
Yeah, I know, and your way, your way is completely insane.
Yeah, I know, babe, it's not gonna happen.
Yeah, I know, baby.
Yeah, I know, baby. Not today. Daddy's busy.
Yeah, I know, but -
Yeah, I know, but - - where is this coming from?
Yeah, I know, but I - I consider that whole area - general area - my cock.
Yeah, I know, but I - I want to talk.
Yeah, I know, but I already have enough credits to graduate.
Yeah, I know, but I can't give a 16 year old boy what he really wants, now can I?
Yeah, I know, but I don't know what we can do about it.
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that's what she wants.
Yeah, I know, but I feel strong.
Yeah, I know, but I found evidence.
Yeah, I know, but I had a vision about her death, and she wasn't alone.
Yeah, I know, but I had to make other arrangements.
Yeah, I know, but I hate going to see the doctor. My health care plan's a joke.
Yeah, I know, but I have a, um,
Yeah, I know, but I have a, um, a couple finishing touches to do on my dresses,
Yeah, I know, but I have a, um, a couple finishing touches to do on my dresses,
Yeah, I know, but I have to -
Yeah, I know, but I just got here and I'm anxious to hear.
Yeah, I know, but I just really need to get t of town, okay?
Yeah, I know, but I just... I don't know.

Yeah, I know, but I mean, look at that Baltimore job.
Yeah, I know, but I need it now.
Yeah, I know, but I read the records,
Yeah, I know, but I read the records, and there's no indication of a scar behind his left ear.
Yeah, I know, but I realized something.
Yeah, I know, but I saw it on the monitor. You think you saw it on the monitor.
Yeah, I know, but I scrubbed the background and separated the different frequencies,
Yeah, I know, but I should have seen it coming.
Yeah, I know, but I think we tried enough.
Yeah, I know, but I think we're the only white people on the plane.
Yeah, I know, but I thought about it, and it's ridiculous.
Yeah, I know, but I told you, I'm fine.
Yeah, I know, but I was completely out of order and l 'm...
Yeah, I know, but I was talking on the phone
Yeah, I know, but I was talking on the phone to the school
Yeah, I know, but I'm - I'm his manager.
Yeah, I know, but I'm - I'm his manager. I have the right to see him.
Yeah, I know, but I'm back, and I want to, you know, be here.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to be careful about what I eat.
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love
Yeah, I know, but between surgeries, teaching and life...
Yeah, I know, but every night I come home,
Yeah, I know, but first you're gonna have to write up a 784,
Yeah, I know, but first you're gonna have to write up a 784,
Yeah, I know, but for argument's sake...
Yeah, I know, but he probably sent it out to a lab.
Yeah, I know, but he wants me to feel something
Yeah, I know, but he's dead.
Yeah, I know, but he's got a new guy. Best one I've ever seen.
Yeah, I know, but if I start, and then you come in after -
Yeah, I know, but if I take him out, she lives.
Yeah, I know, but if you had to.
Yeah, I know, but it can wait.
Yeah, I know, but it didn't show her location.
Yeah, I know, but it still feels shitty.
Yeah, I know, but it's a big change for me,
Yeah, I know, but it's a lastminute thing.
Yeah, I know, but it's a little crazy here today.
Yeah, I know, but it's funny.
Yeah, I know, but it's the park and it's watery,
Yeah, I know, but it's true flava - Flav, he fucks me too
Yeah, I know, but last time I lied,
Yeah, I know, but maybe he's carrying her again.
Yeah, I know, but maybe they fought and that triggered an aneurysm.
Yeah, I know, but moland?
Yeah, I know, but mommy says I can't.
Yeah, I know, but now I kind of see why you enjoy it so much.
Yeah, I know, but now I kind of see why you enjoy it so much.
Yeah, I know, but now I've realized this just doesn't work for me anymore.
Yeah, I know, but right now, I can't think of one.
Yeah, I know, but since it's kind of creepy
Yeah, I know, but stubborn stains need special care.
Yeah, I know, but that Web site relies
Yeah, I know, but that doesn't make this any easier.
Yeah, I know, but that one sounds made up, even for you.
Yeah, I know, but that's all I seem to say these days -
Yeah, I know, but that's kind of my point.
Yeah, I know, but that's kinda crazy, don't you think?
Yeah, I know, but that's not my problem.
Yeah, I know, but that's the space for creativity,
Yeah, I know, but the show is the music.
Yeah, I know, but the sixth call was placed 30 seconds into the blackout.
Yeah, I know, but the state troopers are the only ones
Yeah, I know, but the thing is,
Yeah, I know, but there's a reason why it was sitting collecting dust in front of a souvenir shop, all right?
Yeah, I know, but there's a reason why it was sitting?
Yeah, I know, but they can still pretend.
Yeah, I know, but they said they could rent it a month early.

Yeah, I know, but they're waiting on me.
Yeah, I know, but this is his wife.
Yeah, I know, but this is how I roll.
Yeah, I know, but this is what I've been thinking about lately.

Yeah, I know, but those are right 99.8% of the time.
Yeah, I know, but we can't with the protocols and...
Yeah, I know, but we don't have any money, remember?
Yeah, I know, but we got money coming
Yeah, I know, but we got money coming in from the family business and...
Yeah, I know, but we need to get her midline.
Yeah, I know, but we tortured that kid to get it.
Yeah, I know, but what I'm thinking is this -
Yeah, I know, but what about sweaty nuclear guy?
Yeah, I know, but what does that have to do with computers?
Yeah, I know, but what if it was the same one.
Yeah, I know, but when I do,
Yeah, I know, but where?
Yeah, I know, but why did you buy me a gift?
Yeah, I know, but wouldn't you flip out just a little bit?
Yeah, I know, but you can't be too prepared.
Yeah, I know, but you don't understand.
Yeah, I know, but you got to get me in the room.
Yeah, I know, but you know us lawyers, we hate to lose arguments.
Yeah, I know, but you know us lawyers. We hate to lose arguments.
Yeah, I know, but you know what the rules say.
Yeah, I know, but you'll get over it whereas that guy -
Yeah, I know, but you'll get over it.
Yeah, I know, but, honestly,
Yeah, I know, but, like, people get in a groove,
Yeah, I know, but, uh, maybe we should play along.
Yeah, I know, but, uh.
Yeah, I know, but, uh... You know Blair...
Yeah, I know, but, um, some things, once they happen,
Yeah, I know, but, um...
Yeah, I know, but, you know,
Yeah, I know, but, you know, I can have someone call us
Yeah, I know, but, you know, you are going to have to talk to him at some point.
Yeah, I know, but...
Yeah, I know, but... I'm gonna go.
Yeah, I know, but... It'll be like a wonderful reunion.
Yeah, I know, but... There it is.
Yeah, I know, but... You need an endorsement, Harvey.
Yeah, I know, but... You should have waited.
Yeah, I know, chief. I have three daughters of my own.
Yeah, I know, code names, but "potato" is ridiculous!

Yeah, I know, he can, but he can't take her to the dance.
Yeah, I know, he needs some chitty - chitty - boom - boom.
Yeah, I know, he said it was like meeting an old Uncle.
Yeah, I know, he's a rag to win,
Yeah, I know, he's in my front yard.
Yeah, I know, he's really, really, really extremely, monumentally pissed.
Yeah, I know, he's the smaller one.
Yeah, I know, honey, but you said we would do it someday, not now.
Yeah, I know, if she was just a little bit harder...
Yeah, I know, in the ballroom it's all in your core and it's like that
Yeah, I know, it does feel like that, doesn't it?
Yeah, I know, it does. And I'll own it.
Yeah, I know, it is lovely.
Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time.
Yeah, I know, it sounds crazy. You'd be surprised what a detective will dig through
Yeah, I know, it sounds disgusting
Yeah, I know, it sounds simple, but he's very busy.
Yeah, I know, it's Incredible.
Yeah, I know, it's been a long time.

Yeah, I know. I did the drill while you were out.
Yeah, I know. I didn't mean it like that.
Yeah, I know. I do.
Yeah, I know. I don't believe in that anymore either.
Yeah, I know. I don't believe you.
Yeah, I know. I even told her that.
Yeah, I know. I feel like there's weight off my shoulders.
Yeah, I know. I figured this out.
Yeah, I know. I gave him boxes of files on Raymond.
Yeah, I know. I gave it up. Never!

Yeah, I know. I just feel like I'm so close to finding him.
Yeah, I know. I just kind of liked it, you know?
Yeah, I know. I just like to stick it to these self-righteous little pricks.

Yeah, I know. I just saw her leave.
Yeah, I know. I just, I don't know, man.
Yeah, I know. I just, uh -
Yeah, I know. I just...

Yeah, I know. I know all of that, and yet...
Yeah, I know. I know how hard it must be to know where she lives.

Yeah, I know. I know it's a problem. But I just need some help, man.
Yeah, I know. I know that.
Yeah, I know. I know that. I - I knocked on your door last night, hoping that you could help...

Yeah, I mean, I was going to kick him in the crotch or something, scratch his eyes out, I don't know,
Yeah, I mean, I was thinking...

Yeah, I mean, a few of us were pretty scared...
Yeah, I mean, a guy his size, there could've been a way through, especially with some digging.
Yeah, I mean, a guy his size, there could've been a way through, especially with some digging.
Yeah, I mean, after he lost his job at the casino,
Yeah, I mean, all of that.

Yeah, I mean, better he leaves now
Yeah, I mean, better he leaves now than when the baby's out
Yeah, I mean, but he could've split them with me.
Yeah, I mean, by doing so it gives me one step father ahead.
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening to you!
Yeah, I mean, come on. It's beneath us, isn't it?
Yeah, I mean, crossing class boundaries that extreme would be rare
Yeah, I mean, days before either murder.
Yeah, I mean, do they even make that in Argentina?
Yeah, I mean, don't you think I should get some of the money?
Yeah, I mean, don't you think I should get some of the money?
Yeah, I mean, even I would punch a duck.
Yeah, I mean, even in the country they need young women to IAP dance.
Yeah, I mean, even in the country they need young women to lap dance.
Yeah, I mean, even stranger than that,
Yeah, I mean, even stranger than that, is that they were raped eight years apart.
Yeah, I mean, ever since I got here,
Yeah, I mean, everybody does when they're little, but, uh, even when I got older.
Yeah, I mean, everybody's going, so...
Yeah, I mean, except for,
Yeah, I mean, except for, I went to Washington to get into politics,
Yeah, I mean, except for, you know, all those times
Yeah, I mean, for a short time,
Yeah, I mean, four months ago, he couldn't move.
Yeah, I mean, go. Enjoy your date.
Yeah, I mean, he gets cranky every so often, but I like him...
Yeah, I mean, he had the candles, the dress, the communion thing, but that's it.
Yeah, I mean, he has a kid in high school. Well, so do I.
Yeah, I mean, he likes this bike, right?
Yeah, I mean, he might know where he is, right?
Yeah, I mean, he was a month late.
Yeah, I mean, he's an amazing young man...
Yeah, I mean, he's rough with her,
Yeah, I mean, he's rough with her, he's always putting her down.
Yeah, I mean, he's this curly - headed black hole that sucked the air out of the universe.
Yeah, I mean, he, uh... He's nice.
Yeah, I mean, hey, everybody makes mistakes...
Yeah, I mean, hopefully she won't even know I've been gone.
Yeah, I mean, how did you give it to them?
Yeah, I mean, how long can we run?
Yeah, I mean, if he's sanding down his fingerprints, just imagine what he did to our vic's face.
Yeah, I mean, if she hadn't, there always would've been a part of me holding out
Yeah, I mean, if she's a good person then who knows?
Yeah, I mean, if that's cool.
Yeah, I mean, if we can recreate this stage
Yeah, I mean, if we can recreate this stage of crystallization,
Yeah, I mean, if we find the common user name that
Yeah, I mean, if we're gonna stay up, then I'll just pop some popcorn, and...
Yeah, I mean, if you can't go to Stanford until next year
Yeah, I mean, if you guys want to.
Yeah, I mean, if you wanna say anything to her,
Yeah, I mean, if you, uh, if you don't - if you don't mind.
Yeah, I mean, if you, uh, if you don't - if you don't mind. You know, whatever.
Yeah, I mean, in the past
Yeah, I mean, is it cheating if everyone does it? Yes.
Yeah, I mean, is it possible
Yeah, I mean, isn't - Matt. Matt!
Yeah, I mean, it could be a woman.
Yeah, I mean, it could be a woman.
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't really matter what he is.
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't really matter what he is. She.
Yeah, I mean, it had to be her, didn't it?
Yeah, I mean, it is charming as hell. Does it have wi - fi?
Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty deep.
Yeah, I mean, it reads like a crazy person's to - do list.
Yeah, I mean, it was probably him
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't bullish, but...
Yeah, I mean, it would be weird if we didn't do something.
Yeah, I mean, it would definitely be weird.
Yeah, I mean, it's a cold case, right? It's as old as Methuselah.
Yeah, I mean, it's a little embarrassing,
Yeah, I mean, it's a little embarrassing, all the acclaim, but, uh, I got the skills.
Yeah, I mean, it's a nice design, but probably gets a bit annoying.
Yeah, I mean, it's a really... It's kind of a safe place.
Yeah, I mean, it's a top - flight policy.
Yeah, I mean, it's a top - flight policy.
Yeah, I mean, it's been a while,
Yeah, I mean, it's classic...
Yeah, I mean, it's completely stupid and reckless.
Yeah, I mean, it's fine with me, go for it.
Yeah, I mean, it's just hard to not feel guilty,
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a puzzle.
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like keep your friends close,
Yeah, I mean, it's no Rembrandt.
Yeah, I mean, it's not actually a...
Yeah, I mean, it's not exactly comfortable for me either.
Yeah, I mean, it's not fair.
Yeah, I mean, it's not like we're
Yeah, I mean, it's not like we're getting married or anything, but...
Yeah, I mean, it's out of the way.
Yeah, I mean, it's possible, right?
Yeah, I mean, it's something we really wanted to film,
Yeah, I mean, it's sort of charming that she's a con artist.
Yeah, I mean, it's... Some nice wall decorations and that,
Yeah, I mean, just as friends.
Yeah, I mean, just be quick about it, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I mean, just purely a, you know...
Yeah, I mean, last night kinda got me to thinking,
Yeah, I mean, last year,
Yeah, I mean, leaves, insects, some hair -
Yeah, I mean, like I - I guess, I mean, obviously, you know,
Yeah, I mean, listen...
Yeah, I mean, looks like a guy that was in the can with me.
Yeah, I mean, meeting the friends, and Jason and dancer girl with the tits.
Yeah, I mean, must have belonged to one of the other girls.
Yeah, I mean, my couch is open.
Yeah, I mean, my couch is open.
Yeah, I mean, my face, my shoulder. My stomach.
Yeah, I mean, my office is a disaster right now,
Yeah, I mean, next thing you know,
Yeah, I mean, next thing you know,
Yeah, I mean, no one wants to go away for the weekend
Yeah, I mean, not that dramatic. Obviously, there was no Jennifer.
Yeah, I mean, once we got into the writing of it, it just spun out of control.
Yeah, I mean, people are concerned that maybe I'm just flirting and manipulating other people to,
Yeah, I mean, people think they know about music,
Yeah, I mean, retiring early would be very nice.
Yeah, I mean, she has a key, so I guess it's possible.
Yeah, I mean, she lets me drive the Porsche.
Yeah, I mean, she seems a little confused about
Yeah, I mean, she sounds really eager to rent.
Yeah, I mean, she was acting weird,
Yeah, I mean, she was acting weird,
Yeah, I mean, she was just born.
Yeah, I mean, she's a little kooky,
Yeah, I mean, she's just
Yeah, I mean, she's just totally going through a blah phase.
Yeah, I mean, sign language is a great tool.
Yeah, I mean, smart car.
Yeah, I mean, smart car. Have you seen this thing?
Yeah, I mean, so you're not so brave. I'm not so smart.
Yeah, I mean, so, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, someone's got to tell them.
Yeah, I mean, sure, absolutely,
Yeah, I mean, sure. Absolutely.
Yeah, I mean, thanks for everything.
Yeah, I mean, that would explain it,
Yeah, I mean, that would explain why we can't find them.
Yeah, I mean, that's - I grew up listening to that stuff.
Yeah, I mean, that's great.
Yeah, I mean, that's the only way
Yeah, I mean, that's the tradition.
Yeah, I mean, that's true.
Yeah, I mean, that's what I'm saying. I mean - I mean -
Yeah, I mean, that's what he, that's what he tol...
Yeah, I mean, the Spanish steps right there, the people watching...
Yeah, I mean, the count has a very distinct voice.
Yeah, I mean, the devil thinks you were destroyed by the Ender,
Yeah, I mean, the fun is in the design,
Yeah, I mean, the movie still works for me. Great.
Yeah, I mean, the movie still works for me. Great.
Yeah, I mean, the truth is, as much as I wish that Clark could shatter land - speed records,
Yeah, I mean, the world is moving so fast now
Yeah, I mean, the world is moving so fast now
Yeah, I mean, there could be a safe in here,
Yeah, I mean, there might be a few obstacles with that.
Yeah, I mean, there was a lot of money, and you just stayed.
Yeah, I mean, there's a number
Yeah, I mean, there's really not a lot of people
