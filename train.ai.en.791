Carl is going to ask me to marry him.
what?
how do you know?
I heard him talking to his mom when I met the parents last night.
holy crap. This is big.
he's going to have to wear lifts at the wedding or else the kiss will look stupid.
so you've had sex with him?
no, Sasha!
if I had, I'd have told you.
why in the world would you tell me?
are you forgetting the pact?
the eighth grade pact?
we all vowed to call each other after it happened.
you vowed to call us while it happened.
that sounds like me.
boo, whatever that pact was, it was two and a half years ago.
we were babies.
I was still taller than Melanie.
I thought it was nice, made it less of a scary thing.
it was nice, Boo.
we'll tell each other, I promise.
what is going on here?
what is she carrying?
I think it's a picnic basket.
she rode up to school in a scooter.
where did she get the picnic basket?
and she's wearing a suede dress. She was not wearing that this morning.
or this afternoon when she changed.
it's her third outfit.
beautiful spread.
that's wine.
I mean, is that legal? Isn't she 16?
he gave her a peck on the cheek.
how in the world does she already know Mitch Alvarado?
I've been going to school with Mitch Alvarado since kindergarten. I still haven't met Mitch Alvarado.
this is so urban and sophisticated.
I'm gonna puke.
Ginny, we need information. Go grill the brother.
me? Why me? - Because we voted and you won.
you didn't vote. - Who wants Ginny to go talk to the brother?
all right.
Hello, Virginia.
how did you know my name? - How did you know mine?
how do you know I know your name?
I didn't. I do now.
so, you and your sister. New kids in town, huh?
cause we notice when new people move in.
we're perpetually bored, so...
this is going in the garbage. - What is?
this. - I can't quite see...
but you would if I let it survive.
is that bad, seeing a picture?
isn't that the point?
so where are you guys from?
we're nomads. We're just in from Bavaria.
bavaria, really?
that's where mad Ludwig's castle is. I've always wanted to see that.
the way he saw it, or the way it is?
you'll see soon.
that's me. That's us.
it's warmer today than I thought.
why doesn't my paella look like the paella in the book?
you should have just kept it simple.
it's just rice, onions, garlic, sausage, shrimp, chicken, muscles, and saffron stock.
what's simpler than that? - She's supposed to be on bed rest.
I'm on stool rest. Just as good.
plus we have a special guest. - I'm not a special guest.
are you kidding? This is historic. Boo has never brought a boy home except when she was six and she brought home little Maxie Rucker.
without informing Maxie's parents.
and they arrested Rusty and me because we were responsible for Boo's actions or something.
it was hysterical.
you kidnapped a kid?
Hey, how about we not bring up anecdotes from my childhood tonight, okay?
the paella in the book is brown. Why is mine green?
please, let's just order pizzas.
no, that's surrendering. Never surrender!
never surrender! Never surrender!
I didn't know Beez would have his two boobs with him tonight.
we had no choice. When it's my turn to watch the Winkleburn kids, then it's my turn to watch the Winkleburn kids.
do you boil it inside the pouch, or do you open the pouch and dump it in?
I think you keep it in the pouch and drop it in the boiling water.
thank you, young man.
rusty, you're watching TV.
I'm not watching TV. - Then turn it off.
the kids will start crying. - You'll start crying.
mom, let's get this dinner moving. We are losing momentum.
Oh, I'll put barbeque sauce on it. That'll make it brown.
Yes. - I love barbeque sauce.
you know, if there's not gonna be enough, I can just eat down at the firehouse.
chicken parm night. It's a good night.
dad, we are having dinner with Carl.
well, Carl can come with me. I like Carl.
it's barbequed paella I'm not too crazy about.
did...
did anyone else hear that? - That was just Boo's brother.
and the Winkleburns. They get into it.
they sure do.
there. Brown paella. Dish that up.
I'm gonna pee.
so exciting. You never know when it's gonna end.
you know, I can't believe you just whipped up this dessert, Carl.
what's it called again? - Bananas foster.
it's just bananas, brown sugar, butter, and vanilla ice cream. It's nothing.
nothing! I've got Rachel Ray making me dessert here, and he says it's nothing.
Rachel Ray is a girl.
proof. I want proof!
Hey, mom, where's dad? He went to the bathroom 20 minutes ago.
I should probably check on him.
sometimes he's so tired he pulls an Elvis and falls asleep on the throne.
let's hope he's not pulling a full Elvis.
let's help your mother clean up.
you're a saint.
the banana foster was really good.
I hope so. I didn't use quite as much butter as I'd like.
I thought it would be a good idea to cut off the part - of the cube that had teeth marks on it. - Yeah.
I can show your mom how to make it. Your dad was really into it.
even Beez seemed to... - Okay, I'll marry you.
what? - Let's do it. Let's get married.
the sooner the better. - Married?
I just need to finish high school first, okay? And you should too.
then we'll get married and go to college. People have done that.
there's special housing for married couples.
I think I saw that somewhere in a movie once.
love Story. "Porky's." - Boo.
and who knows, after I lose those last few pounds and get a little more training,
I can make it into a good dance company, maybe New York.
we'll live in New York. That's where you'll go to school.
there are some great schools in New York.
or we could just be engaged and live in New York while I'm dancing and you're going to college, but that puts me in the why-buy-the-cow...
when-you-can-get- the-milk-for-free category, so we're just going to have to bit the bullet and get married.
whoa, whoa, Boo...
I know I'm just a loaf of unbaked bread, Carl, but I make a good wife.
and a good mother to your children, if you want children. I'm torn.
if I give birth to the Winkleburn kids, I am sending them back.
boo, let me say something.
okay, but hurry because we have a lot of planning to do.
where is this coming from?
I heard you talking to Sweetie. - Oh, Boo...
saying that I'm the girl you're going to marry. I was touched.
and nauseous, - but mostly touched. - Boo, listen.
what I said that night about us getting married?
I didn't mean it literally. - You didn't?
my mother, I love her, but she yaps and doesn't listen.
the only way I can get her to hear me is to be ridiculously dramatic.
so you don't want to get married.
well, it's a little early don't you think?
well, yeah.
not that I don't think you're great marriage material, but I kind of don't want to miss my last year of summer camp.
it comes with hot dog privileges.
Yeah. - Yeah.
Yeah.
so, I'm not just a loaf of unbaked bread?
Nah, you're fully baked.
and by the way, you're dad's not on the throne.
he snuck down to the firehouse for some chicken parm.
he confided in me man-to-man. It was cool.
he's even bringing me one back.
turn off your motor there, Speedy.
my leg always jiggles when I'm nervous.
just take a deep breath.
my niece isn't even allowed to sit on my lap anymore.
not since I catapulted her into a wall.
God, that's her.
Hello, Truly. - Hello, Milly.
this is my friend, Michelle. - Nice to meet you.
if I had known you were bringing a friend, I'd have brought Leonard.
who's Leonard? - Leonard's a good friend of mine.
he has a sailboat, and sometimes we play squash.
he's going to be sorry he missed this.
so, shall we pretend we're really here for a pleasant lunch or save ourselves the calories?
we need to talk about the lease. - Sign it and we're good to go.
you raised the rent 40%. - It reflects current market comps.
if I knew what that meant, I'm sure I would disagree with it.
Milly, I think what truly is wondering is does the rent increase need to be that steep?
well, Michelle, normally I would defer to Leonard on this, but I'll have you know that I'm doing Truly a big favor.
I've got a national lube and tune company begging me for that space, and they pay more.
I can't say which company it is, but you have both gotten lubed there.
well, what about the improvements I've made to the space?
a glittery toilet seat with Barry Gibbs' face on it does not constitute an improvement.
but maybe we could find a middle ground here. Huh?
something that we could all live with?
well, if by "we" you mean you, me, Truly and Leonard, well, of course I'd have to consult with Leonard on this, but no, there is no middle ground. It's the market rate or nothing.
Milly, I have invested all of my money into Sparkles.
I can't believe you're willing to destroy it like this.
your money? Really? - Don't start.
you're gonna pretend it's not mom's money?
so I borrowed money from mom. So what? - Mom?
so she dipped into her 401K to buy you a bunch of dresses.
she never did anything for me.
Oh, you are so her favorite, with your fancy holiday parties and your perfect little daughter.
she's not perfect anymore. Not since you gave her that concussion.
hold on a second. Quick question... are you two sisters?
Yes. - Unfortunately.
why didn't you mention this before?
it wasn't relevant.
you're sisters. It's relevant.
it's because she hates me. That's why she didn't mention it.
she hates me.
okay, Truly, go get a soda or something. Let me talk to Milly for a second.
really, go.
so... sisters.
it happens. - But it's only happened once to you, Milly.
you have one sweet, special person you can call sister.
is it really worth a few lousy bucks to ruin that?
we have two other sisters.
one's okay. The other one's an actress.
but how can Truly not be your favorite? She's got so much spunk.
spunk is what got my Abba CD's turned into a super-cute prom dress.
but Milly, you're a businesswoman.
your family relationship should not affect your business. Should it?
well, there's more.
she...
she what?
look, truly did something awful to me once.
but concussions heal, don't they?
Oh, who cares about that? She stole my boyfriend.
Oh, ouch.
and it was a man I cared for very deeply.
and she knew that.
but don't you think it's time to remove all that from the equation and just let Truly stay in her shop that she loves so much?
forget the past and move on?
but Truly knew that it was leading to something more serious.
and she went ahead and seduced Hubbell away from me anyway.
am I just supposed to forget about all that?
I'm sorry, did you just say Hubbell?
do you know who I am?
you're Truly's friend.
I'm Michelle Simms. I married Hubbell.
you're the Madame? - Showgirl.
so...
do we have a deal?
truly, mi amigo, we have got ourselves a game plan.
I get my shop back? - No, you keep using my place until we figure something else out.
that's our game plan? - That's all we got.
and I'm giving your niece two years of free tap class once she gets that protective helmet off.
that woman is rough.
he's a martial arts expert and a master mechanic.
and she speaks French, and Spanish, and Japanese, and Latin, and Farsi and Urdu.
come on. - I heard it from a good source. Fluent Urdu.
they're definitely the most popular kids in school.
in just two days? How?
networking. Multi-lingual networking.
Hey, watch it, rookie.
all the girls are in love with him.
Really? - Not me.
and all the guys are in love with her.
some of the girls too. Not me.
okay. Stop. Enough about her. - I agree.
let's get inside. We're gonna be late.
isn't she incredible?
her name's Cozette. She's really gonna raise the bar for us.
trippy song, huh?
all right, everyone. Let's get the bar centered and let's get started.
quick announcement, everyone.
we're starting 15 minutes later tomorrow.
you can still come, stretch, relax...
mad
destroy this
the is clear this time! I swear!
abort!
we've got to stop meeting like this. - Or take it to the next step.
marry, have a couple of kids.
who bears the children?
how about we alternate? - That'll work.
I thought you had a date tonight.
I ended it early. Marion was definitely not my type.
you went out with a chick? - It was a guy.
now for some reason I feel weirdly compelled to defend him.
John Wayne's real name was Marion.
and he changed it to John.
true.
poor Marion.
so, let me guess... you're here rehearsing the turn, twist, slide, kick you saw Baryshnikov do in "White Nights
and you're not leaving till you nail it?
I was meeting Roman. - Sasha...
relax. I just canceled it.
but why here? Why not your house?
my house is a disaster zone.
there's no way I'm talking him there.
so it's here? In a place that smells like sweaty tights, because that'll really get you in the mood.
it's nothing that calls for mood.
we just want a place to talk and hang and listen to music.
what about school? - I'm with my friends at school.
Oh, Sasha, you don't know the first thing about dating.
as soon as you meet a boy, you dump your friends. That's what boys are for.
I did not know that.
so you don't need the talk. - The talk?
the talk.
no...
but you can give it anyway. I'd love to hear your version.
well, it's a good one. You'll never use a public toilet seat again.
I told him to abort. Must have been too late.
it's not Roman.
are you kidding? I've been trying to get a hold of you all day.
what's up? - You don't answer texts, phone calls, e-mails.
I've been driving around. I finally spotted your car out front.
all those "Rockford Files" finally paid off.
enough mouth, Sasha.
you are tough, kid.
fine. I just thought you'd want to know he's leaving.
who? - Your dad.
again? - No, not again.
he's really leaving. It's over with us.
your father has a special someone and he's moving in with him.
I did not think this was gonna be my life.
anyway, he's moving out now. I'm going next week.
going? Where are you going?
back to L. A. I miss it.
I miss Encino. Sue me.
well, what about me?
you have a choice, Sophie.
you could either go with your dad to San Jose or you can come with me.
just let me know quick, so I can make plans.
what about the house?
Oh, I'm dumping that house. I hate that house.
so that's my choice? To move away?
Yes. - No!
what? - I'm not going. I'm staying here.
sixteen-fifty for you, sixteen-fifty for me.
Loretta, I'm leaving.
what do you mean?
as soon as I get my check, I'm gone.
I'll be back.
Dwight, I need my check. - Payday's at the end of the month.
haven't paid us for last month. I need money, Loretta's got a kid.
problem with management? Put a note in the suggestion box.
I'm serious. I'm quitting. - I'll be back for the dinner shift.
I'm sure as hell it won't be.
what are you doing?
I'm taking what he owes me, not a penny more.
you take that money, he's gonna come after you.
gotta find me first. - What you gonna do?
this ought to cover that bike for little Keith.
you're late to pick him up.
go. I got everything covered here.
you're really going?
I'm really going.
that bike can wait till Christmas.
you keep what he owes you. I'll deal with Dwight, okay?
see you later.
how much to Los Angeles?
one-way or round-trip? - You're kidding, right?
Hey, Coco. Coco Puff, you're on. Come on. You're on, you're on.
we may not have windows......but we do have the best view on Sunset Strip
twenty bucks.
what is this place, a strip club?
"strip club"?
I should wash your mouth out with J, Germeister.
the only pole you'll find in there is Natasha, the shot girl.
baby cakes, I got a club to fill here.
right, sorry.
enjoy.
show a little more, show a little less, add a little smoke, welcome to Burlesque.
everything you dream of but never can possess, nothing's what it seems.Welcome to Burlesque
everyone is buying.
put your money in my hand, if you got a little extra.
well, give it to the band.
you may not be guilty, but you're ready to confess. Tell me what you need.
welcome to Burlesque.
you can dream of Coco.
do it at your risk.
the triplets grant you mercy, but not your every wish.
Jesse keeps you guessing.
so cool and statuesque, "Behave yourself," says Georgia.
welcome to Burlesque.
everyone is buying.
put your money in my hand, if you got a little extra.
well, you know where I am.
something very dark, is playing with your mind. It's not the end of days, it's just the bump and grind.
show a little more, show a little less, add a little smoke.
welcome to Burlesque - Can I get you a drink? - Only if you're buying.
welcome to L. A. - Thank you.
where you from? - Iowa.
Kentucky. We're practically related. - Thought you looked familiar.
Hey, sweetheart? You wanna do your job? Let's go.
who does a girl have to flirt with to get from here to up there?
is this you flirting?
with someone wearing more eyeliner than me? Yeah.
through that door over there.
ask for Tess.
she's your guy. Flirt away. - Thanks.
Iowa. - Yeah?
use my name.
Thanks, Jack.
hold it! Hold it. That's good.
we're on in five minutes. Five minutes, ladies.
get over there. - All right, I'm coming.
ladies! Let's move it, ladies!
does anyone know where Nikki is?
both spotlights are supposed to pull in.
georgia, your boyfriend is so cute.
so tonight, takeout and a movie?
both.
Casablanca and Oreos. - Yes.
Tess! I lost a contact on the stage.
okay, if you fall off the stage, leg extended, boobs up.
remember, you're a goddess.
thank you, Sean. - You're welcome.
thank you, Sean.
come here, give me.
wait. - What? The foot?
Yeah, the foot, the back, the neck, the hips, the breasts, the face...
Vince, the sink's busted upstairs again.
I'm not calling a plumber, Coco.
Tess, have you read this letter from the bank?
how many times have I told you? No business during business hours.
Marcus Gerber is coming in tonight. - So what?
this isn't going away.
you won't talk to me before the show, after the show.
it's like you're avoiding me.
I didn't divorce you to spend more time with you.
I may not be "Mr. Tess" anymore, but I still own half this place.
Mr. Tess, that is so hot.
nice, but it won't pay the bills.
wait. Wait. Zip me up.
excuse me, I'm looking for Tess.
Hi, are you Tess?
and you are in my mirror because?
Oh, sorry. I'm friends with Jack, and I'm looking for a job.
and where have you danced?
at home, mostly. But I can move.
okay, give your name and number to Sean.
let you know when we're having our audition.
when will that be, exactly?
Sean?
where the hell is Nikki? - I don't know. She's late again.
Oh, I'm never late. Ever.
that's great.
we're trying to put on a show here. Come back another time.
I've never seen anything like this.
I need a job. I wanna work here. - Great enthusiasm, terrible timing.
so leave your name and your number with Jack, your friend downstairs.
and we'll call you. Okay? Promise.
Hey, can you fix this for me?
let's move it, ladies!
hello. - Oh, my God. Nikki.
you're probably not gonna believe this......but Sean and I were talking, and he said...
I said, "It's so sad that Nikki couldn't join us for the opening number. But it would be so great if she joined us for the next one.
paws and claws. Took longer than I thought.
so is finding a new job when I fire you.
Yeah, right.
get ready. - Yeah.
Hey. Bring me a martini. Extra dry, straight up, three olives.
and hurry back. - She doesn't work here.
then she's not busy.
twenty minutes and we're back.
your mama tell you it's not polite to stare?
you're just so damn beautiful, I
well, in that case, screw your mama and stare away.
no one would ever know.
know what?
that you're a dude.
God. - Can I use this?
goddamn it! Don't touch my stuff!
Hey, waitress!
sweetheart? Hey, over here.
one second.
yo!
ladies? - I'll have a vodka.
what can I get you?
what are you doing? - One night.
if I'm not better than boobs-for-brains, you don't have to pay me.
isn't that the girl that was backstage?
I think so.
Hey, Jack, what's she doing here?
she really wanted a job.
and so she is our new waitress.
and when did I make you head of personnel?
she just picked up a tray, started working.
Really? - Well, her name is Ali.
Ali.
Hey, Ali.
look, this is cute, but come on.
push up those boobs. Got them, show them. Work them.
and don't ever go behind my back again.
Yes, ma'am. - And don't ever call me ma'am again.
Yes, sir. I mean ma'am. I mean Tess. - Get on the floor.
ma'am?
what am I, my mother?
Yes, ma'am.
up yours.
excuse me. Dewar's rocks and a bottle of your best champagne.
Oh, and will you tell Nikki that I'm here?
and you are...?
a member since '91.
Marcus Gerber. And you are?
Ali. - Ali.
I'm here.
you're late, you're late for a very important date.
georgia went on for you.
what is that waitress doing here? I want that bitch out now.
what did she ever do to you?
she told me I look like a drag queen. - Can't be the first time.
get my spot.
Nikki, what are you doing?
Hey!
Ali. Ali.
Ali. Ali. What do you need?
Dewar's rocks, bottle of Dom and keep it coming.
Yep. So he's a regular, huh?
Marcus Gerber, real estate guy, dating Nikki. This week at least.
I wanna be up there. I wanna do that.
question is do you have the talent? - I do.
are you sure? - Yes.
positive? - Yeah.
good, because you're on.
I got a dentist.
who's over seven feet tall?
Ooh, I've got a dentist, baby, the man is over seven feet tall. His name is Dr. Long John and he answers every call.
it's simple. I assume all your financial obligations buy you out, I will pay you a million right off the top.
five hundred each.
where is the partnership? You said there was gonna be a partnership.
how about a partnership?
partnerships don't really work so well with me.
and that deal is very generous.
good. Because I lead with my final offer.
not that I give a shit, but why is it that you want my club so badly?
I like it.
I see something I like, I have to have it. Since I was a kid.
that must have made you very popular in the sandbox.
I did okay.
you know what you could do with that?
you know what you could do with that money?
not now. - Don't "not now" me.
the way I see it, you're in a fix and I'm in a position to help.
.
we play this thing right, and we all come out winners.
Yeah.
you got that balloon payment due on the first.
did you also tell him I have a tattoo on my ass?
no. It's business.
I don't think you're gonna get another opportunity like this. So take it.
no. - She means not now.
no, no. "Not now" means not now, Vince.
no means no.
Marcus, I don't care what you're offering.
my club is not for sale.
well, offer's on the table.
Thanks.
see you in the sandbox.
Wendy! Do you have my makeup?
drinks, ladies.
all right, white wine.
Tom Collins.
which one is Nikki's?
both. - Shit.
that was my shot.
here's mud in your eye, Niki.
all right. Now I got a buzz, and you gotta change. You're on.
what are you, my mother?
in case you haven't noticed, Vince was talking to Marcus.
well, that's because Marcus is trying to buy my club.
mother of God.
Tess? Probably not a good time.
I know you're busy and I don't mean to interrupt.
Hey! Did anybody talk to Dave about the new vocals?
that's what I've been thinking about.
all the girls lip-synch- - Except for Tess.
except for Tess.
but wouldn't it be great if we actually heard the girls sing?
no. It wouldn't be great.
honey, people come here to watch the dancers dance and to watch them lip-synch to the great singers.
I hear you. I get it.
I'm just thinking of ways to make it better.
I don't understand why we can't try.
you don't understand because it's above your pay grade.
I don't get what that means. Hear me out. This is a good idea
ali, Ali, no- No. No. No.
stop. Take her and remove her.
okay, let's go. Come on.
they need you on the floor, but thanks for visiting.
all right. Oh, this is not for anybody.
you look so beautiful right now. I can't even tell you.
and you are so full of shit.
goddamn it!
Ali?
you can just have a seat.
I'm gonna grab us both a drink, yeah?
Oh, and here.
call whoever you want. Long distance, whatever.
I can't. - What do you mean?
I don't have anyone.
no parents or siblings, aunts, uncles, anyone?
no one.
so you're not here to use my phone.
no, no, stop. It's gonna be all right.
you can crash here.
just please, please, stop crying.
okay. Okay.
I'll take that.
better?
good.
just one night.
till it's light out and I can figure out my next move.
deal.
that's beautiful.
who wrote that?
I did.
you wrote that?
Jack, that's... That's really good.
thank you.
you have more? - Yeah.
nothing that's ready to be heard.
Hey, Jack, why did you leave Kentucky?
why did you leave Iowa?
because I looked around and realizedthere wasn't one person whose life I wanted.
exactly.
Hey, Jack.
I'm really glad I don't have to be alone tonight.
get some sleep.
morning.
coffee? - Black.
like my soul.
I took the liberty of making breakfast.
I hope you don't mind. It's the least I could do.
smells great.
she's pretty. Your sister?
you thought I was gay? - Yeah.
wait, why? - I don't know. The day bed, eyeliner.
it's a very straight look.
you know, it works at the club, Tess loves it.
okay.
I should put on some pants.
probably.
she's in New York doing a play.
now that you're straight and engaged, I feel really weird I came here in the first place.
I'm all right.
I'll be out of your hair in no time. - You don't have to leave.
don't worry about me. - It's pouring outside.
I got a plan. If you could just get the door for me.
thank you.
you're welcome. - See you at the club.
Ali! What are you doing?
come back inside!
no, Jack, I'm fine.
it's pouring.
it's just water, for chrissake.
damn it.
get your ass back in my house.
you've done enough. I'm fine.
all right, all right, fine. Here we go.
put me down. What are you doing?
you have nowhere to go and I have a couch.
like it or not, you're gonna stay.
Hey, Natalie.
Really? That's great.
Georgia?
Yeah.
Oh, God, please don't have the flu.
Oh, God.
please have the flu.
why do they call it morning sickness if it hits you at every fricking moment of the day?
have you told Damon yet?
no, not yet.
well, sweetheart, you know, at some point he's going to notice.
he's a guy.
he's not gonna notice until my belly's blocking the TV.
well, what are you gonna do?
I don't know, Tess. I'm really scared.
Oh, honey, don't be scared.
whatever you decide, we will take care of you. Okay?
but you've got to tell Damon.
I figured as long as he doesn't know I can still pretend he's gonna be excited about it.
he's gonna be thrilled. Are you kidding? He'll be thrilled.
excellent. That was great.
thank you very much, ladies.
what happened to all the great dancers in L. A?
they're dancing with the stars.
call Andre and ask. He might have somebody.
okay.
don't like her, I don't like her.
I don't love any of them. She's the best one.
what is that?
what is she doing?
I think she's auditioning.
Hey, Dave, cut it!
hold on a second, I can do this.
and I think it's sweet that you think you can.
tell me what you're looking for. - Someone who can do the routine.
excuse me? I'm talking to you!
Oh, shit.
just tell me what you want.
I can't tell you.
nobody can tell you.
you gotta make me believe that you belong up there.
that you own that stage and that nobody's gonna take it from you.
that's the way it works.
you wanna show me something, show me that.
all right.
which number do you wanna see? I know everyone.
every number? - Which one do you wanna see?
what's going on?
well, I couldn't keep my eyes off her.
try harder.
you were off the whole last half.
come on, Tess. Come on, I'll practice till I bleed. I know I can do this.
you know, we have better dancers.
then say thank you very much and goodbye.
if you just give me a chance. I swear I won't disappoint you.
didn't anybody ever give you a shot?
please, I want this so bad.
if you just give me a chance, I'd- - All right. God!
you got the job.
what are you so excited about? She's your replacement.
thank you, Tess. You won't regret it.
I am so gonna regret this.
what is Ali short for?
Alice. - Alice?
well, welcome to Wonderland.
meet me upstairs in five.
well, sorry for the short notice but I quit.
it's okay.
and with my new raise, I will be off your couch in no time.
here we go.
black corset, first number.
second number, "Wagon Wheel," that's that.
swarovski bustier, that's for the third number.
and this is for "Miss Otis Regrets."
and remember, with that, don't pull the trigger.
you like her. I know it kills you, but you have to admit it.
no. You know, she pulls focus, she doesn't blend in.
a girl that doesn't blend in?
Oh, my.
that is so beneath you.
here we go, here we go. Don't lose those again.
how you doing?
my boobs are pushed up to my ears, my thong's a mile up my butt and my eyelashes are so thick they could kick up a stiff wind.
fun being a girl, isn't it? Come on, let's go, let's go.
you guys wanna go grab pizza? - Yes, please.
Yeah. - I'm starving.
good, let's go.
my day was so long.
ice cream sounds so good.
that's so bad.
I'm gonna get so full tonight. - What?
where is everybody?
they went out for pizza.
I wasn't hungry.
that brush isn't working. It's too old.
well, it's the only brush I have.
I'll let you use mine.
here. - Thanks.
all right, here. Let me help you.
wet it if you're gonna get a clean line.
close your eyes.
when you are putting on your makeup, it's like you're an artist. But instead of painting on a canvas, you're painting your face.
my mom was a model and she was beautiful, tall, blond. Not like me, body that could stop a truck.
and she had these girlfriends, beautiful girls, Colleen and Shirley and they would come over in the morning, and put their makeup on together before they went on jobs. Up, we had a window in the back of our house with a ledge...and they would put their mirrors side by side and put out their makeup.
they had lipsticks and blushes, and it was fabulous.
I kept thinking, "God, I cannot wait till I get old enough to play with this.
didn't you ever watch your mom put on her makeup?
my mom died when I was 7 and it's my first lesson.
you know, you won't be the new girl forever.
beautiful.
shit.
Ali.
Ali. Did you use my towel again?
I found it soaking wet on the floor.
I don't know. Maybe. - How's that apartment hunt?
I've been looking. Everything's over 1000 bucks a month.
how can you put a price on privacy like that? Freedom?
your own bathroom? Clean towels?
okay, I get it.
it's Natalie.
Hey, babe.
Oh, hey. What about Beachwood Canyon?
great.
if you have a car.
I mean, truth is you really should get a car first.
I mean, this is L. A. after all. You know?
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna suck it up and let you stay a little bit longer.
throw in something for rent, we're good.
a second ago you wanted me out. - I don't like my towel wet.
I don't like the lack of privacy but you're in a jam. And I'm the kind of guy when a friend is in trouble, I help. It's just who I am.
what did Natalie have to say?
nothing. No, she... What did she say?
"hi." That was it.
And? - And...
her play got extended three months.
she has to pay everything there in rent so I have to cover everything here.
so if you wanna stick around and chip in, it would
save your ass? - Help.
well, will you look at that?
the shoe on the other foot.
one minute I'm a freeloader and the next I'm the only thing standing between you and eviction.
just yes or no?
what's the proposal exactly?
wonderful apartment. Bathroom included.
I'm listening.
use of the kitchen. - Keep going.
six hundred a month. - Closet?
half. - Oh, look.
fabulous apartment with a great view.
fine, fine.
the whole closet.
I want the bedroom. - No way.
Oh, look. Hot tub, Beverly Hills.
all right. You can have my bedroom.
are you in?
Oh, Jack.
see, I'm the kind of girl if a friend's in trouble, I help. That's just who I am.
Oh, boy.
your dream is killing me!
it's killing me!
what was that?
and what's this?
it's something about the two mortgages.
to be perfectly honest, I haven't got a goddamn clue.
but if I can't raise the amount of money on that paper by the end of this month, I lose the club.
it's just money.
it's just a number.
I know but do you think I could do it?
okay, tell me a lie.
I need your expert sewing skills.
tell me a new lie.
I don't love you.
come here. Come here.
it's okay.
stage right.
wait a minute. Hey, hey. What's in that?
iced tea.
iced tea, my ass. Go home.
Yeah, right. I'm about to go on.
you're not gonna go on. Go home.
relax. It is one drink. What is the big deal?
ali, you're gonna take Nikki's spot.
she can't dance my part. - She can and she will.
no, no. My God, I can't do that. It is Nikki's number.
you said you can do any number, right?
I don't wanna step on any toes. - Then don't.
I don't care. Listen to me.
you're gonna go on, and you're gonna go home.
here, put this on.
Dave.
Tess wants to see you. Says it's urgent.
I can't leave. I'm working.
don't say I didn't warn you.
shit.
everybody wants Dave to do something.
y'all gonna have me singing by the time I'm done here. Jesus.
Tess, what's up?
what are you doing back here?
Nikki said you were looking for me. - Nikki? What is going on?
lower the curtain. Let's go.
Bye. Thanks for coming.
hold it.
raise the curtain.
Oh, my God.
am I the only one that has no idea what just happened?
whatever it was.
the music stopped, I didn't know what to do.
I had to sing, I'm sorry.
never told me you could sing like that.
I tried to tell you.
okay, okay, all right.
this is what we're gonna do. You know the songs, right?
Oh, yeah.
so tomorrow we're gonna rehearse, then you're gonna sing.
we're gonna go straight through the show live.
so any questions? - No.
okay, good. Good. You go with the guys.
find out what keys you're comfortable singing in and I'm going to go up to my office and plan an entirely new show.
okay? - Oh, my God.
Thanks, Tess.
I'm gonna build a show around her.
they don't come to hear us sing?
they'll come to hear her sing.
so how do you feel?
amazing. - I've never seen anything like that.
Thanks. Are you sure Tess really liked it? She wasn't...?
I was bringing down the curtain.
she stopped me. She's the one who let you sing.
Really? - She wants to build a show around you.
you're crying with happiness, right?
good. Okay.
Brava.
clearly one of us has underestimated the other.
I can't believe Tess has you buried in the kick line.
she didn't know I sang.
well, you certainly can.
and you are way too good to be doing it here.
how about a drink?
the bar's right over there.
tell Jack I sent you.
where the hell did that come from?
who knew that you could do that? - Thanks, Jack.
who knew any white chick could sing like that?
how do you do that?
I don't know. It just happens. I just do it.
I know how that feels. I gotta pee again, so...
stop.
we're gonna get something to eat.
you wanna come?
Yeah, I would.
let's go.
look at you.
what? What?
well, no, just the way you're gazing after her.
Yes. No, I do. I know. Three thousand miles away.
we talk every day.
you do? About what?
let me guess, don't tell me.
about her.
her.
and, I don't know...
her.
aII I'm saying is that that one there is beautiful on the inside as well and she's not going to be available forever.
relationship advice from Mr. One-Night-Stand himself.
that is...
forgot my purse.
what? - Oh, no.
I was just telling Jack here how every opportunity has a shelf life.
come here.
look there.
awfully pretty, but too much.
see, I like that.
no, I'm not cutting my hair.
who said anything about you cutting your hair? You can wear a wig.
I'm wearing one right now.
so good.
hey there, big boy.
so, what do you think?
I think you look, I mean, it looks...
Jack, we're friends, for chrissake.
it's not like we're brother and sister.
no, we certainly are not.
I don't get why everyone's having a conniption.
she's just a tacky farm girl from Iowa.
and we know a cow when we see one.
don't underestimate us farm girls.
Vince.
this round's on me.
I don't normally do this but, Vince, I'm doubling my offer.
it's either you or the auction house.
no, I am not selling.
know what happens when you default on a loan?
no, hum a few bars.
I'm not screwing around. Where's the money coming from?
Ali's a hit. We can charge 50 bucks a head now.
raising the admission? That's not good enough.
you have been saying that the sky is falling forever.
everything always works out fine.
tell that to the people losing everything.
I don't wanna be one of them.
I love this place too. - No, you don't.
I do. - No, you don't!
Yes, I do! - Oh, no, you don't.
look, you have many fine qualities, Vincent.
and then you've got some iffy qualities.
but you've never been a phony.
just tell Marcus no.
Jack?
Yep. Just got in.
I'm in here. Can you come zip me up?
Hey, where you been?
writing music.
can I hear?
it's not ready. - It's not ready.
who's that?
me and my mom on my 7th birthday.
she died a few weeks later.
you must miss her.
every single day something happens that I wish I could tell her about.
and what happened today?
nothing yet.
you should get that. It's probably Natalie.
probably.
Hey, babe.
Yes, I know.
check it out, girls!
I'm starved. You ready?
I can't. I'm so sorry. I have to do inventory tonight.
want me to call a cab?
no, that's okay. I'll get a ride with Coco.
sorry.
watch your back. Coming through.
you ready?
for what? - I'll drop you off.
Coco left five minutes ago.
I was coming to talk to you. I caught your conversation.
talk to me about...? - Dinner. With me. Give me that.
if you ever expect to see this bag alive again you'll follow me.
hold on a second. Where you going? Hey!
where are you taking me? This is not the way to my place.
I told you. Dinner.
dinner?
I'm not going to dinner with you. You're seeing Nikki.
we're just friends.
where I come from, friends don't chew on earlobes.
aren't you glad you left?
Oh, damn it. - What?
I gotta make a quick appearance at a party.
you just remembered.
it's on the way. We'll be quick. Ten minutes, tops. Do you mind?
and if I do?
then you've been kidnapped.
Hey, Marcus.
nice house.
what are you doing? You can't just take that.
put that back. You're gonna get us kicked out.
not if we sneak out.
Hey, hey. Greg, Marla, this is Ali.
Hi. - Hey.
my God, those are amazing shoes.
aren't they? Louboutin.
great party.
always good to have you, man.
wait a minute. You had to make an appearance at your own party?
would've been rude not to, right?
you'd like those guys. Greg's an editor, Marla's a designer.
I'm gonna dream about those shoes.
l. A. looks gorgeous from up here.
that view cost me three times what the house did.
see that strip mall down there?
you own that too?
no. I own everything above it.
there is nothing above it. - Exactly.
so you own air. - Air rights.
guy that owns the mall ran into money issues, almost had to sell.
whoever he sold to would've put up a huge tower.
so I bought the air rights.
no one can build above one story. - Well, aren't you clever.
mall guy gets to keep his property, I keep the second best view in L. A.
what's the first?
how many girls you used that line on? - None who called me on it.
what do you want, Ali?
in life.
and why should I tell you?
you're talented enough to get what you want and I'm smart enough to make it happen.
somebody got a package. - Ali.
Ali. - Who's it from?
come on, open it. - Let's see. Come on.
Oh, my God.
those are so cute.
they're so pretty. - Those are so pretty.
who's the sucker?
let's go. Girls, please, break it up.
Coco, let's go. Five minutes.
ali Cat, you're up next.
my nana used to call me Ali Cat.
did she really? That's fascinating.
why don't I have a nickname? - Oh, you do.
well, he never uses it. - No, I do.
when?
when you leave the room.
slut. - I heard that.
so sorry! I had no idea! Oh, my God.
girls, come on! We have a show to do! Let's go, let's go!
hurry up! Come on!
it's a cold and crazy world That's raging outside.
but, baby, me and all my girls are bringin' on the fire. Show a little leg, gotta shimmy your chest.
it's a life, it's a style, it's a need.
it's burlesque - Hey. - Hey.
you were out late last night.
Oh, I got a ride home with that guy, Marcus.Went to a party.
Marcus?
new shoes?
Yeah.
classy.
there's only one reason a man buys a woman shoes.
so what if I'm getting a little male attention?
you're getting more than a little.
not from anyone that matters.
I just think you should be careful.
and I think if you need to tell a girl what she should and shouldn't do, that's major. - My goodness.
major? Check again. The only thing major is the size of Coco's ass.
Monsieur Louboutin is at Table 18 and he's asking for you.
it's a weird angle.
easy.
I'm so glad you got to.
there she is, the girl of the hour.
you'd go to any length.
I just made a call to Greg at the Times.
I want you to meet a friend of mine. Ali Rose, Harold Saint.
Harold-? Shut up. You worked with Etta James.
her. Chewed me up and spat me out, that one.
hello.
you've got a set of pipes too, young lady.
Thanks.
we have to do something about that.
you snooze, you lose, pretty boy.
standing room only.
doesn't it look great?
but I just got another notice from the bank.
we would have to fill Dodger Stadium for a month to come up with the cash.
I gotta figure out a way to buy us more time.
Hey. - Hey.
that really is a great shot.
it's so weird seeing myself in the paper like that.
well, you might have to get used to it.
I don't think I ever could.
you know, I don't wanna come off like the wise old fairy godmother, but maybe you could learn from my mistakes.
what do you mean?
you gotta learn who are the people you can trust, the people who like you for you, and who are the people who just want something.
you don't like Marcus, do you? - No, I don't.
I don't like him. I don't trust him.
I don't think you should trust him.
but is that really what's best for me or what's best for you?
I don't know.
I hope it's best for both of us.
all right.
see you tomorrow.
there you are.
these babies desperately need your glue gun, okay?
especially this one. - Okay.
okay? - Yep.
she's not going anywhere.
good night. - Night.
Oh, hey, Tess.
I got that track you wanted to rehearse for tomorrow.
Jesus.
honey, I'm sorry. I got a million things on my mind and I completely forgot.
it's all good.
if it's too late I can come in early tomorrow?
no, no. Let's just get it out of the way.
you want a spot?
Yeah.
feelin' broken
barely holdin' on
but there's still something so strong
somewhere inside me
and I am down
but I'll get up again
don't count me out just yet
I've been brought
down to my knees
and I've been pushed
way past the point of breakin'
but I can take it
I'll be back
back on my feet
this is far from over
you haven't seen the last of me
you haven't seen the last of me
they can say that
I won't stay around
but I'm gonna stand my ground
you're not gonna stop me
you don't know me
you don't know who I am
don't count me out so fast
I've been brought
down to my knees
and I've been pushed
way past the point of breakin'
but I can take it
I'll be back
back on my feet
this is far from over
you haven't seen the last of me
there will be no fade-out
this is not the end
I'm down now But I'll be standin' tall again
times are hard but I was built tough
I'm gonna show you all What I'm made of
I've been brought
down to my knees
and I've been pushed
way past the point of breakin'
but I can take it
I'll be back
back on my feet
this is far from over
I am far from over
you haven't seen the last of me
no, no, I'm not goin' nowhere
I'm stayin' right here
Oh, no, you won't see me fade out
I'm not takin' my bow
can't stop me
it's not the end
you haven't seen the last of me
Oh, no, you haven't seen The last of me
you haven't seen the last of me - Tess, we need to talk. - No.
Yes. - I'm tired, Nikki.
well, then you can just listen.
we built this club together, and then some girl shows up from nowhere, ... who hasn't paid her dues- - How do you know?
doesn't sing that way because she's had it easy.
they don't come to hear us sing, Nikki.
or is that just bullshit now?
you're drunk. Go inside and call a cab.
I will not be upstaged by some slut!
then leave.
you'd ruin our friendship over some girl you barely know?
so much for loyalty!
since when did you know anything about loyalty?
how many times have I peeled you off the sidewalk?
how many blackouts?
how many times have I held your head, while you threw up everything but memories?
okay, fine! But I will not stand in the back!
Tess, you need to fix this.
you think you're my only problem? I'm about to lose my club.
the only thing that means anything to me.
I have more to worry about than you pouring tequila on your Cheerios.
fine.
I quit! - I'm glad!
Nikki, don't drive.
by the way, I slept with Vince the night after your honeymoon.
you crazy bitch!
morning.
do you really have to do that at 6 a. m?
coffee?
no, but a little peace and quiet would be nice.
you are a little overdressed for breakfast.
my pajamas were in the bedroom, which was occupied.
you're never here, so it'd be stupid for me to crash on the couch, when there is a perfectly good, empty bed right there.
so, what, do you want the bedroom back?
should be used by someone.
I'm home every night.
maybe not when you think I should be. You are my roommate, not my mother.
however, since it's such an issue...
what the hell. Take the bedroom. I'll sleep on the couch.
fine! - Fine.
you're gonna have to move your shit. - I realize.
it is a total mess in there.
you got stuff everywhere. Clothes, shoes, hair
Jesus! What is your problem? You're acting like a prick.
something you wanna say?
it's not just me.
the people that care about you are worried.
what people?
people, you know? People. Your friends at the club.
we're like a family.
and we look out for each other.
you look out for each other. Like Vince looks after Tess.
and like Nikki looks out for everybody.
and Marcus? He's gonna look out for you?
no, it's fine. It's fine.
he can make things happen for you.
so go ahead, make a deal with the devil.
first, Marcus is not the devil.
he's a smart businessman, who happens to be a gentleman who knows what he wants and goes for it.
I'm just saying. Life is about the choices you make.
the choices I make?
you're a bartender-slash-piano player, who writes songs that are never ready.
that's perfect. Perfect.
please, try not to destroy my apartment. Thanks.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
you may kiss the bride.
wait, what do you mean you are still in New York? Why?
so you just decided not to come?
why does every conversation we have end up being about your future?
you know, you're right.
we should start thinking about our futures.
and I might be looking at mine right now.
that DJ is hot.
you think so?
he keeps looking at me.
maybe he's cuckoo for Coco Puffs.
Really? You think?
Yeah. I think.
he's gorgeous. I think he likes me.
he is gorgeous.
who is paying for this wedding? This rental must have cost a fortune.
Damon's dad is loaded.
is he single?
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.
guess Georgia's not as dumb as I thought.
would you ever do this again?
no.
there's only one man I could see spending the rest of my life with.
and unfortunately, except for a really drunk night in Reno 25, 000 years ago, he bats for the other team.
Oh, no. He bats for the pink team.
Yes.
that is tragique.
I know.
well, it's like all truly great love affairs.
Yeah.
tragic.
it wasn't Reno. It was Tahoe, baby.
and it was lovely.
get a room.
get away.
make it two. Make it two.
looking kind of lonely there, Jack.
liberated, maybe.
Libated, definitely.
but lonely, no. Never lonely.
Cheers.
clink.
how's it going?
iowa, are you still mad at me?
you know, because if you are...
are you drunk?
Oh, I love this song. Yes!
Oh, you rock.
Yeah, baby. You rock.
I'm sorry for being a class-A prick.
you were.
I was.
and, as of about some time ago, I am officially a single man.
you and Natalie broke up?
that we did.
which explains why I am here alone.
so...
...why are you here alone?
do I really look alone to you?
come here.
Jack.
careful.
Oh, my feet are killing me. Take off these shoes, please. Help me.
wait, wait. Be careful.
I got it. No. No.
stay.
good night.
here. Yeah.
night.
okay.
cute jammies.
my mother got me these, thank you very much.
and I haven't worn them yet, so...
go figure.
I forgot to lock the door.
got it? - Good.
good night.
good night.
back again?
water. Don't want a hangover.
smart.
good night. Again.
night. Again.
now, I know- I know I forgot something else.
I remember I locked the door.
that's it. Hungry. I'm hungry.
exactly.
what is so funny? - Jack! Well, you're...
well, I never.
Jack. - Want a cookie?
no?
all right. - Jack.
it's your loss. You change your mind, you know where they are.
sweet love
trapped in your love
I've opened up
unsure I can trust
my heart and I were buried in dust
so it's official.
what?
you are definitely not gay.
so, what about Natalie?
Natalie who?
I found a man I can trust
and, boy, I believe in us
I am terrified to love For the first time
can you see That I'm bound in chains
I finally found my way
I am bound to you
I am bound to you
do that again.
now come here.
I mean, I don't really know what happened.
I had won the Nashville Teen Songwriting Contest.
I even still have my little trophy.
so I took that as
I thought I was supposed to do something important with my life.
then I got to L. A.
and nothing happened.
nothing.
well, you know what?
I believe your music is ready.
the question is are you ready?
for what? - Are you ready? Here I come.
I knew it. - Natalie.
you are a liar. A pathetic, sneaky little liar!
what is she doing here?
I live here. I wanna know why you are here.
I can't believe I bought your bullshit. She's nothing. She's not even pretty.
well, at least you were honest about one thing.
you said that? - I did not.
he did. - No, I didn't.
Yes, he said that. - Look...
I'm sorry, could you just give me some time-?
you're asking me to leave?
you told me you broke it off with her. - I did.
you break up with me over the phone?
I'm out of here. You said it was over. - No. Ali.
ali, please. - What, Jack?
I am sorry. - So am I.
I'm out.
ali, wait. Please.
I must have the wrong apartment.
who are you looking for?
I'm looking for Sean. - Sean.
what's he look like?
yea high.
shaved head.
brown eyes. Glasses.
Sean.
I've been calling him John.
no, it's Sean.
is that him?
Yeah.
Hi.
what are you doing here? - It's a long story.
I shouldn't have come here.
I see I've obviously interrupted something.
might be a bad time.
no, that's okay.
I'm sorry. Ali, did you meet Mike? - Close. My name is Mark.
Hi, Mark.
sorry.
does anybody want any coffee?
Yeah. Why don't I go make the coffee and you guys get better acquainted.
sorry. Did I call you Mike last night?
Yes. Yeah.
but I called you John, so... - Really?
you liked it.
John was my mother's name.
Hey. - Hey, gorgeous.
Hey, Marcus.
you okay? You sound down.
I've been better.
well, I have just the cure.
what's that? - Me.
why don't you come over for dinner?
okay, well, bye. - Yeah, bye. You take care...
Sean. - You too. Okay.
okay, bye.
is Ali here?
ali left.
she went with Marcus.
is that true?
Yeah.
what? - She left a couple hours ago.
I told you that opportunity wouldn't knock forever.
you're right. It doesn't.
Hey.
you.
it's Mark.
mark.
do you want to have some lunch?
Yeah. Sure.
you're cooking.
I just wasted my whole goddamn afternoon talking with the vice president of loans.
this asshole- No, wait. He didn't even look me in the eye.
he just sat there, playing with this wooden thingy on his desk.
what thingy? What? - The long wooden block thingy.
the nameplate?
Yes. Nameplate.
Yeah, and?
and he's not gonna give me the money.
are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.
I'm not a good risk.
and I've got two days before the bank takes the club.
well, then I would say that the situation is pretty bleak.
and I would say that you are a master of the fucking obvious.
why did you say that?
what do you mean, "Why did I say that"? Because it's the truth.
Tess, it's not a judgment, it's the truth.
you don't have any money.
the bank won't give you a loan. It's the eleventh hour.
Hello?
if I were you, I would take Marcus's offer now.
no.
and you don't get to say that to me.
I can take "the sky is falling" from everyone else, but not you.
you know, I need you to be the one that says:
it's only a number, Tess.
we have killed ourselves to keep this place going.
how can you just walk away?
I don't care if you walk away, I don't care what happens.
I will beat down the door of every bank in L. A.
I will never give up this club.
are you sure?
I will never give it up.
there she is.
I thought I'd lost you for a minute at the beginning there.
you are such an asshole.
thank you.
hope you're hungry.
steaks are on.
what is this?
right now it's a model.
when it grows up it'll be multi-use space residential, retail. But this is the Burlesque Lounge.
best view on the Sunset Strip, with no windows.
when I'm through with it, it'll have a thousand.
does Tess know about this?
Tess knows I've made an offer to buy. - What makes you think she'd sell?
I don't think she has a choice. She's going under.
it's a win-win situation for everyone. It's business, not personal.
I think it's personal for Tess.
and for Coco and Sean and what about me?
there are other clubs that you can sing and dance in. Better ones.
you don't get it.
I don't understand. I'm trying to do something that benefits everyone.
how does that make me the bad guy? - It doesn't, Marcus.
it just makes you the wrong guy.
Hi.
so how'd it go at the bank?
this good.
you want a glass for that?
no, no. I am way beyond a glass.
Tess, I gotta talk to you. - Not right now.
Marcus is gonna tear down the club and build a skyscraper.
and how do you know this?
I saw the model. - I didn't know you were close.
we're not. I rushed over so I could tell you.
you're spreading yourself a little bit thin.
Jack, Marcus, whoever.
Tess, I'm trying to help you.
let it go. - She's gotta listen.
okay. Let it go, let it go.
she needs to listen. - She can't now.
well, she's gonna hear me. Watch this.
Tess, I gotta talk to you.
you could knock. This is still my office. - You need to hear what I tell you.
I don't. I am tired of talking. I am talked out.
hear me out. - I don't wanna hear you out.
do you ever listen to anything other than your own voice?
talk.
have you ever heard of air rights?
no, I've never heard of air rights. What are air rights?
now, that's funny.
Jim, let me call you back, huh?
please sit down.
a few years ago you wanted to buy my club and I said no.
Yeah, and now you changed your mind?
no, but just bear with me for a second because I promise this is gonna have a happy ending for both of us.
how much you planning to sell your condos for?
well, they start at a million and go up from there, depending on the view.
that's beautiful.
so, what if I told you that a 20-story office building was going up where my club is?
that would block his view.
ten stories would block his view. - Yeah. Gone.
the way I see it, your beautiful million-dollar ocean and city views are just gonna vanish into thin air.
vanish. - Yeah.
because tomorrow I am going to sell my club to this developer and his 20 stories are gonna be well underway by the time you start selling.
trying to sell. - Yeah. Right.
and so I think that we should talk.
I'd listen to her.
we're gonna have to auction off everything.
anything you want me to keep for you?
no.
I just wanna try and do what's best for both of us.
you gonna shoot me? Please?
no. I'm gonna buy you out.
in the next 24 hours?
no, in the next 24 seconds.
where did you get this?
thin air.
Oh, baby.
thank you.
just put it out in the universe.
I didn't sleep with Vince, I just said that to hurt you.
I crossed the line.
you think?
I wanna come home.
okay, you're home.
now get your ass upstairs and get ready, you're on in 20 minutes.
and if you ever pull half of the crap that she pulled you are gonna be out so quick it's gonna make your head spin.
Yes, ma'am.
and don't ever call me "ma'am" again.
I'm gonna go get dressed for the show.
thank you, Ali.
so this is what happens when you get a little money?
you stop doing manual labor.
I'm back there with broken zippers and ostrich feather fans that won't open or close.
you have no idea what it's like. No idea.
I quit. Quit.
can I use this? - Don't touch my stuff.
I've been looking for you.
well, you found me.
I wanna talk to you.
I really have to get ready.
I know I messed up, okay? Big-time.
when? When you lied to me about your engagement being over or when you kicked me out?
it really was over. Okay? And she's gone.
I'm here to apologize.
no, no. Hey.
I never should have let you walk out that door.
go on.
I want you to come back.
so, what's the proposal, exactly?
well I still have that full box of cookies and an empty day bed.
I want the bedroom.
half.
so are you in or are you out?
Oh, Jack. Now, see I'm the kind of girl that, when a friend's in trouble, I help.
that's just who I am.
shut up.
okay, then. All right.
I...
I finished a song.
I think it's pretty good.
can I hear it? - No.
but you can sing it.

Marcus Gerber is coming in tonight. - So what?
this isn't going away.
you won't talk to me before the show, after the show.
it's like you're avoiding me.
I didn't divorce you to spend more time with you.
I may not be "Mr. Tess" anymore, but I still own half this place.
Mr. Tess.
that is so hot.
nice, but it won't pay the bills.
wait. Wait. Zip me up.

Hi, are you Tess?

Oh, sorry. I'm friends with Jack, and I'm looking for a job.

and we'll call you. Okay? Promise.
Hey, can you fix this for me?
let's move it, ladies!
hello. - Oh, my God. Nikki.
you're probably not gonna believe this but Sean and I were talking, and he said...
I said,It's so sad that Nikki couldn't join us for the opening number but it would be so great if she joined us for the next one.
paws and claws. Took longer than I thought.
so is finding a new job when I fire you.
Yeah, right.

Hey. Bring me a martini.
extra dry, straight up, three olives.

twenty minutes and we're back.

you're just so damn beautiful, I...
well, in that case, screw your mama and stare away.
no one would ever know.

that you're a dude.
God. - Can I use this?
goddamn it! Don't touch my stuff!
Hey, waitress!
sweetheart? Hey, over here.
one second.
yo!
ladies? - I'll have a vodka.
what can I get you?
...and tough guy with the hat over there, he wants a Cosmo.
what are you doing? - One night.
if I'm not better than boobs-for-brains, you don't have to pay me.
isn't that the girl that was backstage?
I think so.
Hey, Jack, what's she doing here?
she really wanted a job.
and so she is our new waitress.
and when did I make you head of personnel?
she just picked up a tray, started working.
Really? - Well, her name is Ali.
Ali.
Hey, Ali.
look, this is cute, but come on.
push up those boobs. Got them, show them. Work them.
and don't ever go behind my back again.
Yes, ma'am. - And don't ever call me ma'am again.
Yes, sir. I mean ma'am. I mean Tess. - Get on the floor.
ma'am?
what am I, my mother?
Yes, ma'am.
up yours.
excuse me.
Dewar's rocks and a bottle of your best champagne.
Oh, and will you tell Nikki that I'm here?
and you are...?
a member since 91.
Marcus Gerber. And you are?
Ali. - Ali.
I'm here.
you're late, you're late for a very important date.
georgia went on for you.
what is that waitress doing here? I want that bitch out now.
what did she ever do to you?
she told me I look like a drag queen. - Can't be the first time.
get my spot.
Nikki, what are you doing?
Hey!
Ali. Ali.
Ali. Ali. What do you need?
Dewar's rocks, bottle of Dom
and keep it coming.
Yep. So he's a regular, huh?
Marcus Gerber, real estate guy.
dating Nikki. This week at least.
I wanna be up there. I wanna do that.
question is do you have the talent? - I do.
are you sure? - Yes.
positive? - Yeah.
good, because you're on.
I got a dentist
who's over seven feet tall
Oh, I've got a dentist, baby
the man is over seven feet tall
his name is Dr. Long John
and he answers
every call
it's simple.
I assume all your financial obligations, buy you out, pay you a million right off the top.
five hundred each.
where is the partnership that? You said there was gonna be a partnership.
how about a partnership?
partnerships don't really work so well with me.
and that deal is- - Very generous.
good. Because I lead with my final offer.
not that I give a shit, but why is it that you want my club so badly?
I like it.
I see something I like, I have to have it. Since I was a kid.
that must have made you very popular in the sandbox.
I did okay.
you know what you could do with that?
you know what you could do with that money?
not now. - Don't "not now" me.
the way I see it you're in a fix and I'm in a position to help.
we play this thing right, and we all come out winners.
Yeah.
you got that balloon payment due on the first.
did you also tell him I have a tattoo on my ass?
no. It's business.
I don't think you're gonna get another opportunity like this.
so take it.
no. - She means not now.
no, no. "Not now" means not now, Vince.
no means no.
Marcus, I don't care what you're offering.
my club is not for sale.
well, offer's on the table.
Thanks.
see you in the sandbox.
Wendy! Do you have my makeup?
drinks, ladies.
all right, white wine.
Tom Collins.
which one is Nikki's?
both. - Shit.
that was my shot.
here's mud in your eye, Nik.
all right. Now I got a buzz, and you gotta change. You're on.
what are you, my mother?
in case you haven't noticed, Vince was talking to Marcus.
well, that's because Marcus is trying to buy my club.
mother of God.
Tess? Probably not a good time.
I know you're busy and I don't mean to interrupt.
Hey! Did anybody talk to Dave about the new vocals?
that's what I've been thinking about.
all the girls lip-synch- - Except for Tess.
except for Tess.
but wouldn't it be great if we actually heard the girls sing?
no. It wouldn't be great.
honey.
people come here to watch the dancers dance and to watch them lip-synch to the great singers.
I hear you. I get it.
I'm just thinking of ways to make it better.
I don't understand why we can't try
you don't understand because it's above your pay grade.
I don't get what that means. Hear me out. This is a good idea
ali, Ali, no- No. No. No.
stop. Take her and remove her.
okay, let's go. Come on.
they need you on the floor, but thanks for visiting.
all right. Oh, this is not for anybody.
you look so beautiful right now. I can't even tell you.
and you are so full of shit.
goddamn it!
Ali?
you can just have a seat.
I'm gonna grab us both a drink, yeah?
Oh, and here.
call whoever you want.
long distance, whatever.
I can't. - What do you mean?
I don't have anyone.
no parents or siblings, aunts, uncles, anyone?
no one.
so you're not here to use my phone.
no, no, stop. It's gonna be all right.
you can crash here.
just please, please, stop crying.
okay. Okay.
I'll take that.
better?
good.
just one night.
till it's light out and I can figure out my next move.
deal.
that's beautiful.
who wrote that?
I did.
you wrote that?
Jack, that's... That's really good.
thank you.
you have more? - Yeah.
nothing that's ready to be heard.
Hey, Jack, why did you leave Kentucky?
why did you leave Iowa?
because I looked around and realized there wasn't one person whose life I wanted.
exactly.
Hey, Jack.
I'm really glad I don't have to be alone tonight.
get some sleep.
morning.
coffee? - Black.
like my soul.
I took the liberty of making breakfast.
I hope you don't mind. It's the least I could do.
smells great.
she's pretty. Your sister?
you thought I was gay? - Yeah.
wait, why? - I don't know. The day bed, eyeliner.
it's a very straight look.
you know, it works at the club, Tess loves it.
okay.
I should put on some pants.
probably.
she's in New York doing a play.
now that you're straight and engaged, I feel really weird I came here in the first place.
I'm all right.
I'll be out of your hair in no time. - You don't have to leave.
don't worry about me. - It's pouring outside.
I got a plan. If you could just get the door for me.
thank you.
you're welcome. - See you at the club.
Ali! What are you doing?
come back inside!
no, Jack, I'm fine.
it's pouring.
it's just water, for chrissake.
damn it.
get your ass back in my house.
you've done enough. I'm fine.
all right, all right, fine. Here we go.
put me down. What are you doing?
you have nowhere to go and I have a couch.
like it or not, you're gonna stay.
Hey, Natalie.
Really? That's great.
Georgia?
Yeah.
Oh, God, please don't have the flu.
Oh, God.
please have the flu.
why do they call it morning sickness, if it hits you at every fricking moment of the day?
have you told Damon yet?
no, not yet.
well, sweetheart, you know, at some point he's going to notice.
he's a guy.
he's not gonna notice until my belly's blocking the TV.
well, what are you gonna do?
I don't know, Tess. I'm really scared.
Oh, honey, don't be scared.
whatever you decide, we will take care of you. Okay?
but you've got to tell Damon.
I figured as long as he doesn't know I can still pretend he's gonna be excited about it.
he's gonna be thrilled. Are you kidding? He'll be thrilled.
excellent. That was great.
thank you very much, ladies.
what happened to all the great dancers in L.A?
they're dancing with the stars.
call Andre and ask. He might have somebody.
okay.
don't like her, I don't like her.
I don't love any of them. She's the best one.
what is that?
what is she doing?
I think she's auditioning.
Hey, Dave, cut it!
hold on a second, I can do this.
and I think it's sweet that you think you can.
tell me what you're looking for. - Someone who can do the routine.
excuse me? I'm talking to you!
Oh, shit.
just tell me what you want.
I can't tell you.
nobody can tell you.
you gotta make me believe that you belong up there.
that you own that stage and that nobody's gonna take it from you.
that's the way it works.
you wanna show me something, show me that.
all right.
which number do you wanna see? I know everyone.
every number? - Which one do you wanna see?
what's going on?
well, I couldn't keep my eyes off her.
try harder.
you were off the whole last half.
come on, Tess. Come on, I'll practice till I bleed. I know I can do this.
you know, we have better dancers.
then say thank you very much and goodbye.
if you just give me a chance. I swear I won't disappoint you.
didn't anybody ever give you a shot?
please, I want this so bad.
if you just give me a chance, I'd- - All right. God!
you got the job.
what are you so excited about? She's your replacement.
thank you, Tess. You won't regret it.
I am so gonna regret this.
what is Ali short for?
Alice. - Alice?
well, welcome to Wonderland.
meet me upstairs in five.
well, sorry for the short notice but I quit.
it's okay.
and with my new raise, I will be off your couch in no time.
here we go.
black corset, first number.
second number, "Wagon Wheel," that's that.
swarovski bustier, that's for the third number.
and this is for "Miss Otis Regrets.
and remember, with that, don't pull the trigger.
you like her. I know it kills you, but you have to admit it.
no. You know, she pulls focus, she doesn't blend in.
a girl that doesn't blend in?
Oh, my.
that is so beneath you.
here we go, here we go. Don't lose those again.
how you doing?
my boobs are pushed up to my ears, my thong's a mile up my butt and my eyelashes are so thick they could kick up a stiff wind.
fun being a girl, isn't it? Come on, let's go, let's go.
you guys wanna go grab pizza? - Yes, please.
Yeah. - I'm starving.
good, let's go.
my day was so long.
ice cream sounds so good.
that's so bad.
I'm gonna get so full tonight. - What?
where is everybody?
they went out for pizza.
I wasn't hungry.
that brush isn't working. It's too old.
well, it's the only brush I have.
I'll let you use mine.
here. - Thanks.
all right, here. Let me help you.
wet it if you're gonna get a clean line.
close your eyes.
when you are putting on your makeup, it's like you're an artist.
but instead of painting on a canvas, you're painting your face.
my mom was a model and she was beautiful.
tall, blond.
not like me.
body that could stop a truck.
and she had these girlfriends, beautiful girls, Colleen and Shirley, and they would come over in the morning and put their makeup on together before they went on jobs. Up.
we had a window in the back of our house with a ledge and they would put their mirrors side by side and put out their makeup.
they had lipsticks and blushes, and it was fabulous.
I kept thinking, "God, I cannot wait till I get old enough to play with this."
didn't you ever watch your mom put on her makeup?
my mom died when I was 7 and it's my first lesson.
you know, you won't be the new girl forever.
beautiful.
shit.
Ali.
Ali. Did you use my towel again?
I found it soaking wet on the floor.
I don't know. Maybe. - How's that apartment hunt?
I've been looking. Everything's over 1000 bucks a month.
how can you put a price on privacy like that? Freedom?
your own bathroom? Clean towels?
okay, I get it.
it's Natalie.
Hey, babe.
Oh, hey. What about Beachwood Canyon?
great.
if you have a car.
I mean, truth is you really should get a car first.
I mean, this is L.A. after all. You know?
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna suck it up and let you stay a little bit longer.
throw in something for rent, we're good.
a second ago you wanted me out. - I don't like my towel wet.
I don't like the lack of privacy but you're in a jam.
and I'm the kind of guy when a friend is in trouble, I help.
it's just who I am.
what did Natalie have to say?
nothing. No, she... What did she say?
"hi." That was it.
And? - And...
her play got extended three months.
she has to pay everything there in rent, so I have to cover everything here.
so if you wanna stick around and chip in, it would...
save your ass? - Help.
well, will you look at that?
the shoe on the other foot.
one minute I'm a freeloader, and the next I'm the only thing standing between you and eviction.
just yes or no?
what's the proposal exactly?
wonderful apartment. Bathroom included.
I'm listening.
use of the kitchen. - Keep going.
six hundred a month. - Closet?
half. - Oh, look.
fabulous apartment with a great view.
fine, fine.
the whole closet.
I want the bedroom. - No way.
Oh, look. Hot tub, Beverly Hills.
all right. You can have my bedroom.
are you in?
Oh, Jack.
see, I'm the kind of girl if a friend's in trouble, I help.
that's just who I am.
Oh, boy.
your dream is killing me!
it's killing me!
what was that?
and what's this?
it's something about the two mortgages.
to be perfectly honest, I haven't got a goddamn clue.
but if I can't raise the amount of money on that paper by the end of this month, I lose the club.
it's just money.
it's just a number.
I know but do you think I could do it?
okay, tell me a lie.
I need your expert sewing skills.
tell me a new lie.
I don't love you.
come here. Come here.
it's okay.
stage right.
wait a minute. Hey, hey. What's in that?
iced tea.
iced tea, my ass. Go home.
Yeah, right. I'm about to go on.
you're not gonna go on. Go home.
relax. It is one drink. What is the big deal?
ali, you're gonna take Nikki's spot.
she can't dance my part. - She can and she will.
no, no. My God, I can't do that. It is Nikki's number.
you said you can do any number, right?
I don't wanna step on any toes. - Then don't.
I don't ca- Listen to me.
you're gonna go on, and you're gonna go home.
here, put this on.
Dave.
Tess wants to see you. Says it's urgent.
I can't leave. I'm working.
don't say I didn't warn you.
shit.
everybody wants Dave to do something.
y'all gonna have me singing by the time I'm done here. Jesus.
Tess, what's up?
what are you doing back here?
Nikki said you were looking for me. - Nikki? What is going on?
lower the curtain. Let's go.
Bye. Thanks for coming.
hold it.
raise the curtain.
Oh, my God.
am I the only one that has no idea what just happened?
whatever it was...
the music stopped, I didn't know what to do.
I had to sing, I'm sorry.
never told me you could sing like that.
I tried to tell you.
okay, okay, all right.
this is what we're gonna do. You know the songs, right?
Oh, yeah.
so tomorrow we're gonna rehearse, then you're gonna sing.
we're gonna go straight through the show live.
so any questions? - No.
okay, good. Good. You go with the guys.
find out what keys you're comfortable singing in and I'm going to go up to my office and plan an entirely new show.
okay? - Oh, my God.
Thanks, Tess.
I'm gonna build a show around her.
they don't come to hear us sing?
they'll come to hear her sing.
so how do you feel?
amazing. - I've never seen anything like that.
Thanks. Are you sure Tess really liked it? She wasn't...?
I was bringing down the curtain.
she stopped me. She's the one who let you sing.
Really? - She wants to build a show around you.
you're crying with happiness, right?
good. Okay.
Brava.
clearly one of us has underestimated the other.
I can't believe Tess has you buried in the kick line.
she didn't know I sang.
well, you certainly can.
and you are way too good to be doing it here.
how about a drink?
the bar's right over there.
tell Jack I sent you.
where the hell did that come from?
who knew that you could do that? - Thanks, Jack.
who knew any white chick could sing like that?
how do you do that?
I don't know. It just happens. I just do it.
I know how that feels. I gotta pee again, so stop.
we're gonna get something to eat.
you wanna come?
Yeah, I would.
let's go.
look at you.
what? What?
well, no, just the way you're gazing after her.
Yes. No, I do. I know. Three thousand miles away.
we talk every day.
you do? About what?
let me guess, don't tell me.
about her.
her.
and, I don't know...
her.
aII I'm saying is that that one there is beautiful on the inside as well and she's not going to be available forever.
relationship advice from Mr. One-Night-Stand himself.
that is...
forgot my purse.
what? - Oh, no.
I was just telling Jack here how every opportunity has a shelf life.
come here.
look there.
awfully pretty, but too much.
see, I like that.
no, I'm not cutting my hair.
who said anything about you cutting your hair? You can wear a wig.
I'm wearing one right now.
so good.
hey there, big boy.
so, what do you think?
I think you look...
I mean, it looks...
Jack, we're friends, for chrissake.
it's not like we're brother and sister.
no, we certainly are not.
I don't get why everyone's having a conniption.
she's just a tacky farm girl from Iowa.
and we know a cow when we see one.
don't underestimate us farm girls.
Vince.
this round's on me.
I don't normally do this but, Vince, I'm doubling my offer.
it's either you or the auction house.
no, I am not selling.
know what happens when you default on a loan?
no, hum a few bars.
I'm not screwing around. Where's the money coming from?
Ali's a hit. We can charge 50 bucks a head now.
raising the admission? That's not good enough.
you have been saying that the sky is falling forever.
everything always works out fine.
tell that to the people losing everything.
I don't wanna be one of them.
I love this place too. - No, you don't.
I do. - No, you don't!
Yes, I do! - Oh, no, you don't.
look, you have many fine qualities, Vincent.
and then you've got some iffy qualities.
but you've never been a phony.
just tell Marcus no.
Jack?
Yep. Just got in.
I'm in here. Can you come zip me up?
Hey, where you been?
writing music.
can I hear?
it's not ready. - It's not ready.
who's that?
me and my mom on my 7th birthday.
she died a few weeks later.
you must miss her.
every single day something happens that I wish I could tell her about.
and what happened today?
nothing yet.
you should get that. It's probably Natalie.
probably.
Hey, babe.
Yes, I know.
check it out, girls!
I'm starved. You ready?
I can't. I'm so sorry. I have to do inventory tonight.
want me to call a cab?
no, that's okay. I'll get a ride with Coco.
sorry.
watch your back. Coming through.
you ready?
for what? - I'll drop you off.
Coco left five minutes ago.
I was coming to talk to you. I caught your conversation.
talk to me about...? - Dinner. With me. Give me that.
if you ever expect to see this bag alive again you'll follow me.
hold on a second. Where you going? Hey!
where are you taking me? This is not the way to my place.
I told you. Dinner.
dinner?
I'm not going to dinner with you. You're seeing Nikki.
we're just friends.
where I come from, friends don't chew on earlobes.
aren't you glad you left?
Oh, damn it. - What?
I gotta make a quick appearance at a party.
you just remembered.
it's on the way. We'll be quick. Ten minutes, tops. Do you mind?
and if I do?
then you've been kidnapped.
Hey, Marcus.
nice house.
what are you doing? You can't just take that.
put that back. You're gonna get us kicked out.
not if we sneak out.
Hey, hey. Greg, Marla, this is Ali.
Hi. - Hey.
my God, those are amazing shoes.
aren't they? Louboutin.
great party.
always good to have you, man.
wait a minute. You had to make an appearance at your own party?
would've been rude not to, right?
you'd like those guys. Greg's an editor, Marla's a designer.
I'm gonna dream about those shoes.
L.A. looks gorgeous from up here.
that view cost me three times what the house did.
see that strip mall down there?
you own that too?
no. I own everything above it.
there is nothing above it. - Exactly.
so you own air. - Air rights.
guy that owns the mall ran into money issues, almost had to sell.
whoever he sold to would've put up a huge tower.
so I bought the air rights.
no one can build above one story. - Well, aren't you clever.
mall guy gets to keep his property, I keep the second best view in L.A.
what's the first?
how many girls you used that line on? - None who called me on it.
what do you want, Ali?
in life.
and why should I tell you?
you're talented enough to get what you want and I'm smart enough to make it happen.
somebody got a package. - Ali.
Ali. - Who's it from?
come on, open it. - Let's see. Come on.
Oh, my God.
those are so cute.
they're so pretty. - Those are so pretty.
who's the sucker?
let's go. Girls, please, break it up.
Coco, let's go. Five minutes.
ali Cat, you're up next.
my nana used to call me Ali Cat.
did she really? That's fascinating.
why don't I have a nickname? - Oh, you do.
well, he never uses it. - No, I do.
when?
when you leave the room.
slut. - I heard that.
so sorry! I had no idea! Oh, my God.
girls, come on! We have a show to do! Let's go, let's go!
hurry up! Come on!
it's a cold and crazy world That's raging outside
but, baby, me and all my girls Are bringin' on the fire
show a little leg Gotta shimmy your chest
it's a life, it's a style, it's a need
it's burlesque - Hey. - Hey.
you were out late last night.
Oh, I got a ride home with that guy, Marcus.
went to a party.
Marcus?
new shoes?
Yeah.
classy.
there's only one reason a man buys a woman shoes.
so what if I'm getting a little male attention?
you're getting more than a little.
not from anyone that matters.
I just think you should be careful.
and I think if you need to tell a girl what she should and shouldn't do...
that's major. - My goodness.
major? Check again. The only thing major is the size of Coco's ass.
Monsieur Louboutin is at Table 18 and he's asking for you.
it's a weird angle.
easy.
I'm so glad you got to
there she is, the girl of the hour.
you'd go to any length.
I just made a call to Greg at the Times.
I want you to meet a friend of mine. Ali Rose, Harold Saint.
Harold-? Shut up. You worked with Etta James.
her. Chewed me up and spat me out, that one.
hello.
you've got a set of pipes too, young lady.
Thanks.
we have to do something about that.
you snooze, you lose, pretty boy.
standing room only.
doesn't it look great?
but I just got another notice from the bank.
we would have to fill Dodger Stadium for a month to come up with the cash.
I gotta figure out a way to buy us more time.
Hey. - Hey.
that really is a great shot.
it's so weird seeing myself in the paper like that.
well, you might have to get used to it.
I don't think I ever could.
you know, I don't wanna come off like the wise old fairy godmother but maybe you could learn from my mistakes.
what do you mean?
you gotta learn who are the people you can trust the people who like you for you and who are the people who just want something.
you don't like Marcus, do you? - No, I don't.
I don't like him. I don't trust him.
I don't think you should trust him.
but is that really what's best for me or what's best for you?
I don't know.
I hope it's best for both of us.
all right.
see you tomorrow.
there you are.
these babies desperately need your glue gun, okay?
especially this one. - Okay.
okay? - Yep.
she's not going anywhere.
good night. - Night.
Oh, hey, Tess.
I got that track you wanted to rehearse for tomorrow.
Jesus.
honey, I'm sorry. I got a million things on my mind and I completely forgot.
it's all good.
if it's too late I can come in early tomorrow?
no, no. Let's just get it out of the way.
you want a spot?
Yeah.
feelin' broken
barely holdin' on
but there's still something so strong
somewhere inside me
and I am down
but I'll get up again
don't count me out just yet
I've been brought
down to my knees
and I've been pushed
way past the point of breakin'
but I can take it
I'll be back
back on my feet
this is far from over
you haven't seen the last of me
you haven't seen the last of me
they can say that
I won't stay around
but I'm gonna stand my ground
you're not gonna stop me
you don't know me
you don't know who I am
don't count me out so fast
I've been brought
down to my knees
and I've been pushed
way past the point of breakin'
but I can take it
I'll be back
back on my feet
this is far from over
you haven't seen the last of me
there will be no fade-out
this is not the end
I'm down now But I'll be standin' tall again
times are hard but I was built tough
I'm gonna show you all What I'm made of
I've been brought
down to my knees
and I've been pushed
way past the point of breakin'
but I can take it
I'll be back
back on my feet
this is far from over
I am far from over
you haven't seen the last of me
no, no, I'm not goin' nowhere
I'm stayin' right here
Oh, no, you won't see me fade out
I'm not takin' my bow
can't stop me
it's not the end
you haven't seen the last of me
Oh, no, you haven't seen The last of me
you haven't seen the last of me - Tess, we need to talk. - No.
Yes. - I'm tired, Nikki.
well, then you can just listen.
we built this club together and then some girl shows up from nowhere who hasn't paid her dues- - How do you know?
doesn't sing that way because she's had it easy.
they don't come to hear us sing, Nikki.
or is that just bullshit now?
you're drunk. Go inside and call a cab.
I will not be upstaged by some slut!
then leave.
you'd ruin our friendship over some girl you barely know?
so much for loyalty!
since when did you know anything about loyalty?
how many times have I peeled you off the sidewalk?
how many blackouts?
how many times have I held your head while you threw up everything but memories?
okay, fine! But I will not stand in the back!
Tess, you need to fix this
you think you're my only problem? I'm about to lose my club.
the only thing that means anything to me.
I have more to worry about than you pouring tequila on your Cheerios.
fine.
I quit! - I'm glad!
Nikki, don't drive.
by the way, I slept with Vince the night after your honeymoon.
you crazy bitch!
morning.
do you really have to do that at 6 a.m?
coffee?
no, but a little peace and quiet would be nice.
you are a little overdressed for breakfast.
my pajamas were in the bedroom, which was occupied.
you're never here, so it'd be stupid for me to crash on the couch when there is a perfectly good, empty bed right there.
so, what, do you want the bedroom back?
should be used by someone.
I'm home every night.
maybe not when you think I should be. You are my roommate, not my mother.
however, since it's such an issue...
what the hell. Take the bedroom. I'll sleep on the couch.
fine! - Fine.
you're gonna have to move your shit. - I realize.
it is a total mess in there.
you got stuff everywhere. Clothes, shoes, hair...
Jesus! What is your problem? You're acting like a prick.
something you wanna say?
it's not just me.
the people that care about you are worried.
what people?
people, you know? People. Your friends at the club.
we're like a family.
and we look out for each other.
you look out for each other. Like Vince looks after Tess.
and like Nikki looks out for everybody.
and Marcus? He's gonna look out for you?
no, it's fine. It's fine.
he can make things happen for you.
so go ahead, make a deal with the devil.
first, Marcus is not the devil.
he's a smart businessman who happens to be a gentleman who knows what he wants and goes for it.
I'm just saying. Life is about the choices you make.
the choices I make?
you're a bartender-slash-piano player who writes songs that are never ready.
that's perfect. Perfect.
please, try not to destroy my apartment. Thanks.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
you may kiss the bride.
wait, what do you mean you are still in New York? Why?
so you just decided not to come?
why does every conversation we have end up being about your future?
you know, you're right.
we should start thinking about our futures.
and I might be looking at mine right now.
that DJ is hot.
you think so?
he keeps looking at me.
maybe he's cuckoo for Coco Puffs.
Really? You think?
Yeah. I think.
he's gorgeous. I think he likes me.
he is gorgeous.
who is paying for this wedding? This rental must have cost a fortune.
Damon's dad is loaded.
is he single?
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.
guess Georgia's not as dumb as I thought.
would you ever do this again?
no.
there's only one man I could see spending the rest of my life with.
and unfortunately, except for a really drunk night in Reno 25, 000 years ago he bats for the other team.
Oh, no. He bats for the pink team.
Yes.
that is tragique.
I know.
well, it's like all truly great love affairs.
Yeah.
tragic.
it wasn't Reno. It was Tahoe, baby.
and it was lovely.
get a room.
get away.
make it two. Make it two.
looking kind of lonely there, Jack.
liberated, maybe.
Libated, definitely.
but lonely, no. Never lonely.
Cheers.
clink.
how's it going?
God. What are we, in junior high?
iowa, are you still mad at me?
you know, because if you are bring it on, baby.
are you drunk?
Oh, I love this song. Yes!
Oh, you rock.
Yeah, baby. You rock.
I'm sorry for being a class-A prick.
you were.
I was.
and, as of about some time ago, I am officially a single man.
you and Natalie broke up?
that we did.
which explains why I am here alone.
so why are you here alone?
do I really look alone to you?
come here.
Jack.
careful.
Oh, my feet are killing me. Take off these shoes, please. Help me.
wait, wait. Be careful.
I got it. No. No.
stay.
good night.
here. Yeah.
night.
okay.
cute jammies.
my mother got me these, thank you very much.
and I haven't worn them yet, so...
go figure.
I forgot to lock the door.
got it? - Good.
good night.
good night.
back again?
water. Don't want a hangover.
smart.
good night. Again.
night. Again.
now, I know- I know I forgot something else.
I remember I locked the door.
that's it. Hungry. I'm hungry.
exactly.
what is so funny? - Jack! Well, you're
well, I never.
Jack. - Want a cookie?
no?
all right. - Jack.
it's your loss. You change your mind...
...you know where they are.
sweet love
trapped in your love
I've opened up
unsure I can trust
my heart and I were buried in dust
so it's official.
what?
you are definitely not gay.
so, what about Natalie?
Natalie who?
I found a man I can trust
and, boy, I believe in us
I am terrified to love For the first time
can you see That I'm bound in chains
I finally found my way
I am bound to you
I am bound to you
do that again.
now come here.
I mean, I don't really know what happened.
I had won the Nashville Teen Songwriting Contest.
I even still have my little trophy.
so I took that as I thought I was supposed to do something important with my life.
then I got to L.A.
and nothing happened.
nothing.
well, you know what?
I believe your music is ready.
the question is...
...are you ready?
for what? - Are you ready? Here I come.
I knew it. - Natalie.
you are a liar. A pathetic, sneaky little liar!
what is she doing here?
I live here. I wanna know why you are here.
I can't believe I bought your bullshit. "She's nothing. She's not even pretty."
well, at least you were honest about one thing.
you said that? - I did not.
he did. - No, I didn't.
Yes, he said that. - Look...
I'm sorry, could you just give me some time?
you're asking me to leave?
you told me you broke it off with her. - I did.
you break up with me over the phone?
I'm out of here. You said it was over. - No. Ali.
ali, please. - What, Jack?
I am sorry. - So am I.
I'm out.
ali, wait. Please.
I must have the wrong apartment.
who are you looking for?
I'm looking for Sean. - Sean.
what's he look like?
yea high.
shaved head.
brown eyes. Glasses.
Sean.
I've been calling him John.
no, it's Sean.
is that him?
Yeah.
Hi.
what are you doing here? - It's a long story.
I shouldn't have come here.
I see I've obviously interrupted something.
might be a bad time.
no, that's okay.
I'm sorry. Ali, did you meet...
... Mike? - Close. My name is Mark.
Hi, Mark.
sorry.
does anybody want any coffee?
Yeah. Why don't I go make the coffee and you guys get better acquainted.
sorry. Did I call you Mike last night?
Yes. Yeah.
but I called you John, so... - Really?
you liked it.
John was my mother's name.
Hey. - Hey, gorgeous.
Hey, Marcus.
you okay? You sound down.
I've been better.
well, I have just the cure.
what's that? - Me.
why don't you come over for dinner?
okay, well...
Bye. - Yeah, bye. You...You take care...... Sean. - You too. Okay.
okay, bye.
is Ali here?
ali left.
she went with Marcus.
is that true?
Yeah.
what? - She left a couple hours ago.
I told you that opportunity wouldn't knock forever.
you're right. It doesn't.
Hey.
you.
it's Mark.
mark.
do you want to have some lunch?
Yeah. Sure.
you're cooking.
I just wasted my whole goddamn afternoon talking with the vice president of loans.
this asshole- No, wait. He didn't even look me in the eye.
he just sat there, playing with this wooden thingy on his desk.
what thingy? What? - The long wooden block thingy.
the nameplate?
Yes. Nameplate.
Yeah, and?
and he's not gonna give me the money.
are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.
I'm not a good risk.
and I've got two days before the bank takes the club.
well, then I would say that the situation is pretty bleak.
and I would say that you are a master of the fucking obvious.
why did you say that?
what do you mean, "Why did I say that"? Because it's the truth.
Tess, it's not a judgment, it's the truth.
you don't have any money.
the bank won't give you a loan. It's the eleventh hour.
Hello?
if I were you, I would take Marcus's offer now.
no.
and you don't get to say that to me.
I can take "the sky is falling" from everyone else, but not you.
you know, I need you to be the one that says:
it's only a number, Tess.
we have killed ourselves to keep this place going.
how can you just walk away?
I don't care if you walk away, I don't care what happens.
I will beat down the door of every bank in L. A.
I will never give up this club.
are you sure?
I will never give it up.
there she is.
I thought I'd lost you for a minute at the beginning there.
you are such an asshole.
thank you.
hope you're hungry.
steaks are on.
what is this?
right now it's a model.
when it grows up it'll be multi-use space, residential, retail.
but this is the Burlesque Lounge.
best view on the Sunset Strip with no windows.
when I'm through with it, it'll have a thousand.
does Tess know about this?
Tess knows I've made an offer to buy. - What makes you think she'd sell?
I don't think she has a choice. She's going under.
it's a win-win situation for everyone. It's business, not personal.
I think it's personal for Tess.
and for Coco and Sean and...
what about me?
there are other clubs that you can sing and dance in. Better ones.
you don't get it.
I don't understand. I'm trying to do something that benefits everyone.
how does that make me the bad guy? - It doesn't, Marcus.
it just makes you the wrong guy.
Hi.
so how'd it go at the bank?
this good.
you want a glass for that?
no, no. I am way beyond a glass.
Tess, I gotta talk to you. - Not right now.
Marcus is gonna tear down the club and build a skyscraper.
and how do you know this?
I saw the model. - I didn't know you were close.
we're not. I rushed over so I could tell you.
you're spreading yourself a little bit thin.
Jack, Marcus, whoever.
Tess, I'm trying to help you.
let it go. - She's gotta listen.
okay. Let it go, let it go.
she needs to listen. - She can't now.
well, she's gonna hear me. Watch this.
Tess, I gotta talk to you.
you could knock. This is still my office. - You need to hear what I tell you.
I don't. I am tired of talking. I am talked out.
hear me out. - I don't wanna hear you out.
do you ever listen to anything other than your own voice?
talk.
have you ever heard of air rights?
no, I've never heard of air rights. What are air rights?
now, that's funny.
Jim, let me call you back, huh?
please sit down.
a few years ago you wanted to buy my club and I said no.
Yeah, and now you changed your mind?
no, but just bear with me for a second, because I promise this is gonna have a happy ending for both of us.
how much you planning to sell your condos for?
well, they start at a million and go up from there, depending on the view.
that's beautiful.
so, what if I told you that a 20-story office building was going up where my club is?
that would block his view.
ten stories would block his view. - Yeah. Gone.
the way I see it, your beautiful million-dollar ocean and city views are just gonna vanish into thin air.
vanish. - Yeah.
because tomorrow I am going to sell my club to this developer and his 20 stories are gonna be well underway by the time you start selling.
trying to sell. - Yeah. Right.

I'd listen to her.

I just wanna try and do what's best for both of us.

in the next 24 hours?
no, in the next 24 seconds.

what would really make me so happy is to hear from you a great, big, giant, fat: thank you, Ali.
I didn't sleep with Vince, I just said that to hurt you.
I crossed the line.
you think?
I wanna come home.
okay, you're home.
now get your ass upstairs and get ready, you're on in 20 minutes.
and if you ever pull half of the crap that she pulled you are gonna be out so quick it's gonna make your head spin.
Yes, ma'am.
and don't ever call me "ma'am" again.
I'm gonna go get dressed for the show.
thank you, Ali.
so this is what happens when you get a little money?
you stop doing manual labor.
I'm back there with broken zippers and ostrich feather fans that won't open or close.
you have no idea what it's like. No idea.
I quit. Quit.
can I use this? - Don't touch my stuff.
I've been looking for you.
well, you found me.
I wanna talk to you.
I really have to get ready.
I know I messed up, okay? Big-time.
when? When you lied to me about your engagement being over or when you kicked me out?
it really was over. Okay? And she's gone.
I'm here to apologize.
no, no. Hey.
I never should have let you walk out that door.
go on.
I want you to come back.

well, I still have that full box of cookies.
and an empty day bed.
I want the bedroom.

Oh, Jack. Now, see, I'm the kind of girl that, when a friend's in trouble, I help.

I...I finished a song.
I think it's pretty good.

Hey, you got a problem with management? Put a note in the suggestion box.
Dwight, I'm serious. I'm quitting. - I'll be back for the dinner shift.

Vince, how many times have I told you? No business during business hours.
Marcus Gerber is coming in tonight. - So what?
this isn't going away.
you won't talk to me before the show, after the show.
it's like you're avoiding me.
I didn't divorce you to spend more time with you.
I may not be "Mr. Tess" anymore, but I still own half this place.
Mr. Tess.
that is so hot.
nice, but it won't pay the bills.
excuse me, I'm looking for Tess.
Hi, are you Tess?
and you are in my mirror because?
Oh, sorry. I'm a friend with Jack, and I'm looking for a job.

okay, give your name and number to Sean.
we'll let you know when we're having our audition.

Sean? - Enh.

and we'll call you. Okay? Promise.
Hey, can you fix this for me?
let's move it, ladies!

you're probably not gonna believe this...
but Sean and I were talking about you, and he said...
I said, "lt's so sad that Nikki couldn't join us for the opening number...
but it would be so great if she stopped by and joined us for the next one.
paws and claws took longer than I thought.
and so is finding a new job when I fire you.
Yeah, right.
get ready. - Yeah.
Hey, bring me a martini.
extra dry, straight up, three olives.
and hurry back. - She doesn't work here, Nikki.
then she's not busy.
twenty minutes and we're back.
did your mama ever tell you it's not polite to stare?
you're just so damn beautiful, I...
well, in that case, screw your mama and stare away.
no one would ever know.
know what?
that you're a dude.
God. - Can I use this?
goddamn it! Don't touch my stuff!
Hey, waitress!
sweetheart? Hey, over here.
one second.
yo!

what are you doing? - One night.
if I'm not better than boobs-for-brains, you don't have to pay me.
# A kiss on the hand may be quite continental #
# But diamonds are a girl's best friend #
# A kiss may be grand... #
isn't that the girl that was backstage?
I think so.
Hey, Jack, what's she doing here?
she really wanted a job.
and so she is our new waitress.
and when did I make you head of personnel?
she just picked up a tray, started working.
Really? - Well, her name is Ali.
Ali.
Hey, Ali.
look, this is cute, but come on.
push up those boobs. Got them, show them. Work them.
and don't ever go behind my back again.
Yes, ma'am. - And don't ever call me ma'am again.
Yes, sir. I mean ma'am. I mean Tess. - Get on the floor.

Dewar's rocks and a bottle of your best champagne from your table.
Oh, and will you tell Nikki that I'm here?
and you are...?
a member since '91.
Marcus Gerber. And you are?
Ali. - Ali.
I'm here.
you're late, you're late for a very important date.
georgia went on for you.
what is that waitress doing here? I want that bitch out now.
what did she ever do to you?
she told me I look like a drag queen. - That can't be the first time that's happening.
get my spot.
Nikki, what are you doing?
# I've heard of affairs that are strictly platonic. #
# But diamonds are a girl's best friend. #
# And I think affairs that you must keep liaisonic #
# are better bets #
# if little pets get big baggettes #

# And youth is gone #
# And you can't straighten up when you bend. #
# But stiff back or stiff knees, #

Ali. Ali.
Ali. Ali. What do you need?
Dewar's rocks, a bottle of DOM...
a Bottle of DOM and keep it coming.
Yep. So he's a regular, huh?
Marcus Gerber, real estate guy.
dating Nikki. This week at least.
I wanna be up there. I wanna do that.
the question is do you have the talent? - I do.
are you sure? - Yes.
positive? - Yeah.
good, because you're on.
# I got a dentist #
# Who's over seven feet tall #
# Ooh, l've got a dentist, baby #
# The man is over seven feet tall #
# His name is Dr. Long John #
# And he answers #
# Every call #
it's simple.
I assume all your financial obligations...
buy you out...
pay you a million right off the top.
five hundred each.
where is the partnership that...? You said there was gonna be a partnership.
how about a partnership?
partnerships don't really work so well with me.
and that deal is... - Very generous.
good. Because I lead with my final offer.
not that I give a shit, but why is it that you want my club so badly?
I like it.
when I see something I like, I have to have it. Have been worse since I was a kid.
that must have made you very popular in the sandbox.
I did okay.
do you know what you can do with that money, Tess?
do you know what you can do with that money, Vince?
not now. - Don't "not now" me.
the way I see it...
you're in a fix and I'm in a position to help.
we play this thing right, and we all come out winners.
Yeah.
remember you got that balloon payment due on the first.
did you also tell him I have a tattoo on my ass?
no. It's business.
I don't think you're gonna get another opportunity like this.
so take it.
no. - She means not now.
no, no. "Not now" means not now, Vince.
no means no.
Marcus, I don't care what you're offering.
my club is not for sale.
well, offer's on the table.
Thanks.
Oh, see you in the sandbox.
# When he got done drilling, he said #
# Oh baby, that's gonna cost you #
# ten. #
# But if it ever starts into throbbing #
# Come back and see old Long John #
# Again and again and again and again. Again! #
Wendy! Do you have my makeup?
drinks, ladies.
all right, white wine.
Tom Collins.
which one of these is Nikki's?
both. - Shit.
that was my shot.
here's mud in your eye.
all right. Now I got a buzz, and you gotta change. You're on.
what are you, my mother?
in case you haven't noticed, Vince was talking to Marcus earlier.
Yeah, well, that's because Marcus is trying to buy my club.
mother of God.
Tess? Probably not a good time.
I know you're busy and I don't mean to interrupt anything like that.
Hey! Did anybody talk to Dave about the new vocals?
ha, that's what l've been thinking about.
vocals... all the girls lip-sync... - Except for Tess.
of course, except for Tess.
but wouldn't it be great if we actually heard the girls sing?
no. It wouldn't be great.
honey.
people come here to watch the dancers dance and to watch them lip-sync to the great singers.
I hear you. I get it.
I'm just thinking of ways to make it better.
I don't understand why we can't just try something different...
you don't understand because it's above your pay grade.
I don't really get what that means. Just hear me out, Tess. This is a good idea...
ali, Ali, no... No. No. No.
stop. Take her and remove her.
okay, let's go. Come on.
they need you on the floor, but thanks for visiting us.
all right. Oh, this is not for anybody.
you look so beautiful right now. I can't even tell you.
and you are so full of shit.
goddamn it!
Ali?
you can just have a seat.
I'm gonna grab us both a drink, yeah?
Oh, and here.
call whoever you want.
long distance, whatever.
I can't. - What do you mean?
I don't have anyone.
no parents or siblings, aunts, uncles, anyone?
no one.
so you're not here to use my phone.
no, no, stop. Stop, please. lt's gonna be all right.
you can crash here.
just please, please, stop crying.
okay.
I'll take that.
better?
good.
just one night.
just till it's light out and I can figure out my next move.
deal.
that's beautiful.
who wrote that?
I did.
you wrote that?
Jack, that's... That's really good.
thank you.
you have more? - Yeah.
none that's ready to be heard.
Hey, Jack, why did you leave Kentucky?
why did you leave Iowa?
because I looked around and realized, there wasn't one person whose life I wanted.
exactly.
Hey, Jack.
I'm really glad I don't have to be alone tonight.
get some sleep.
morning.
coffee? - Black.
like my soul.
I took the liberty of making breakfast.
I hope you don't mind. It's the least I could do.
smells great.
she's pretty. Your sister?
fiancee. - You're straight?
you thought I was gay? - Yeah.
wait, why? - I don't know. The day bed, the eyeliner.
it's a very straight look.
you know, it works at the club, Tess loves it...
okay.
I should put on some pants.
probably.
so where is she, this fiancee?
she's in New York doing a play.
now that you're straight and engaged...
I feel really weird I came here in the first place.
I'm all right.
I'll be out of your hair in no time. - Really. you don't have to leave.
don't worry about me. - It's pouring outside.
I got a plan. If you could just get the door for me.
thank you.
you're welcome. - See you at the club.
Ali! What are you doing?
come back inside!
no, Jack, I'm fine.
it's pouring.
it's just water, for Chrissake.
damn it.
get your ass back in my house.
you've done enough. Just leave me alone. I'm fine.
all right, all right, fine. Here we go.
put me down. What are you doing?
you have nowhere to go and I have a couch.
like it or not, you're gonna stay here for a few more days.
Hey, Natalie.
Really? That's great.
Georgia?
Yeah.
Oh, God, please don't have the flu.
Oh, God.
please have the flu.
why do they call it morning sickness if it hits you at every fricking moment of the day?
have you told Damon yet?
no, not yet.
well, sweetheart, you know, at some point he's going to notice.
he's a guy.
he's not gonna notice until my belly's blocking the TV.
well, what are you gonna do?
I don't know, Tess. I'm really scared.
Oh, honey, don't be scared.
whatever you devide, we will take care of you. Okay?
but you've got to tell Damon.
I guess... I figured as long as he doesn't know...
I can still pretend he's gonna be excited about it.
he's gonna be thrilled. Are you kidding? He'll be thrilled.
excellent. That was great.
thank you very much, ladies.
what happened to all the great dancers in L. A?
they're dancing with the stars.
call Andre and ask. He might have somebody.
okay.
don't like her, I don't like her.
I don't love any of them. She's the best one.
what is that?
what is she doing?
I think she's auditioning.
Hey, Dave, cut it!
hold on a second, I can do this.
and I think it's sweet that you think you can.
just tell me what you're looking for. - I'm looking for someone who can do the routine.
excuse me? I'm talking to you!
Oh, shit.
just tell me what you want.
I can't tell you.
nobody can tell you.
you gotta make me believe that you belong up there.
that you own that stage and that nobody's gonna take it from you.
that's the way it works.
you wanna show me something, show me that.
all right.
which number do you wanna see? I know every single one of...
you know every single number? - Which one do you wanna see?
"Wagon Wheel Watusi."
what's going on?
well, I couldn't keep my eyes off her.
try harder.
you were off the whole last half.
come on, Tess. Come on, I'll practice till I bleed. I know I can do this.
you know, we have better dancers.
well, then say thank you very much and goodbye.
if you just give me a chance. I swear to God I won't disappoint you.
didn't anybody ever give you a shot in life?
please, I want this so bad.
if you just give me a chance, I'd... - All right. God!
you got the job.
what are you so excited about? She's your replacement.
thank you, Tess. You won't regret it.
I am so gonna regret this.
what is Ali short for?
Alice. - Alice?
well, welcome to Wonderland.
meet me upstairs in five.
well, sorry for the short notice...
but I quit.
it's okay.
and with my new raise, I will be off your couch in no time.
here we go.
black corset, first number.
second number, "Wagon Wheel" that's that.
swarovski bustier, that's for the third number.
and this is for "Miss Otis Regrets."
and remember, with that, don't pull the trigger.
you like her. And I mean it. I know it kills you, but you have to admit it.
no. You know, she pulls focus, she doesn't blend in.
a girl that doesn't blend in?
Oh, my.
that is so beneath you.
here we go, here we go. Don't lose those again, Okay?
how you doing?
my boobs are pushed up to my ears, my thong's about a mile up my butt...
and my eyelashes are so thick. They could kick up a stiff wind.
fun being a girl, isn't it? Come on, let's go, let's go.
do you guys wanna go grab pizza? - Yes, please.
Yeah. - I'm starving.
good, let's go.
my day was so long.
ice cream sounds so good.
that's so bad.
I'm gonna get so full tonight. - What?
where is everybody?
they went out for pizza.
I... I wasn't hungry.
that brush isn't working because it's too old.
well, it's the only brush I have.
I'll let you use mine.
here. - Thanks.
all right, here. Let me help you.
first of all, you've got to wet it if you're gonna get a clean line.
close your eyes.
when you are putting on your makeup...
it's like you're an artist.
but instead of painting on a canvas...
you're painting your face.
my mom was a model and she was beautiful.
tall, blond.
not like me.
body that could stop a truck.
and she had these girlfriends, beautiful girls, Colleen and Shirley...
and they would come over in the morning...
and they were all put their makeup on together before they went on jobs. Up.
we had a big window in the back of our house with a ledge on it...
and they would put their mirrors side by side by side and put out their makeup.
they had lipsticks and blushes, and it was fabulous.
I kept thinking, "My God, I cannot wait till I get old enough to play with this junk."
didn't you ever watch your mom put on her makeup?
my mom died when I was 7...
and it's my first lesson.
you know, you won't be the new girl forever.
beautiful.
shit.
Ali.
Ali. Did you use my towel again?
I found it soaking wet, and on the floor.
I don't know. Maybe. - How's that apartment hunt?
I've been looking. Everything's over 1000 bucks a month.
how can you put a price on privacy like that? Freedom?
your own bathroom? Your own clean towels?
okay, I get it.
it's Natalie.
Hey, babe.
Oh, hey. What about Beachwood Canyon?
great.
if you have a car.
I mean, truth is...
you really should get a car first.
I mean, this is L. A. after all. You know?
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna suck it up and let you stay a little bit longer.
just throw in something for rent, we're good.
a second ago you wanted me out of here. - I really don't like my towel being wet.
I don't like the lack of privacy...
but you're in a jam.
and I'm the kind of guy when a friend is in trouble, I help.
it's just who I am.
what did Natalie have to say?
nothing. No, she... Wow... What did she say?
"hi." I think. That was it.
And? - And...
her play got extended three more months.
so she has to pay everything there in rent...
so I have to cover everything here.
so if you wanna stick around and chip in, it would...
save your ass? - Help.
well, will you look at that?
the shoe on the other foot.
one minute I'm a freeloader...
and the next...
I'm the only thing standing between you and eviction.
just yes or no?
what's the proposal exactly?
wonderful apartment. Bathroom included.
I'm listening.
full use of the kitchen. - Keep going.
six hundred a month. Utilities included. - Closet?
half. - Oh, look.
fabulous apartment with a great view.
fine, fine.
the whole closet.
I want the bedroom. - No way.
Oh, look. "Hot tub, Beverly Hills.
all right. You can have my bedroom.
are you in?
Oh, Jack.
see, I'm the kind of girl if a friend's in trouble, I help.
that's just who I am.
Oh, boy.
your dream is killing me!
it's killing me!
what was that?
and what's this?
it's something about the two mortgages.
to be perfectly honest, I haven't got a goddamn clue.
but if I can't raise the amount of money on that paper by the end of this month, I lose the club.
it's just money.
it's just a number.
I know...
but do you think I could do it?
okay, tell me a lie.
I need your expert sewing skills.
tell me a new lie.
I don't love you.
come here. Come here.
it's okay.
stage right.
wait a minute. Hey, hey. What's in that?
iced tea.
iced tea, my ass. Go home.
Yeah, right. I'm about to go on.
no, no. You're not gonna go on. You're gonna go home.
relax. It is one drink. What is the big deal?
ali, you're gonna take Nikki's spot.
she can't dance my part. - Oh yeah, she can and she will.
no, no. Oh my god, I can't do that. It's Nikki's number.
no, no, no, wait. You said you can do any number, right?
I just don't wanna step on any toes. - Then don't.
I don't care... Listen to me.
you're gonna go on, and you're gonna go home.
here, put this on.
Dave.
Tess wants to see you. Says it's urgent.
I can't leave right now. I'm working.
don't say I didn't warn you.
shit.
everybody wants Dave to do something.
you'll gonna have me singing by the time I'm done here. Jesus.
# Tough lover. Yeah, yeah... Ooh... #

# When he does that wiggle... #
Tess, what's up?
what the hell are you doing back here?
Nikki said you were looking for me. - Nikki said? What is going on?
Nikki just told me that...
lower the curtain. Come on, let's go.
Bye. Thanks for coming.
# Ooh, oh... #
hold it.
# Yeah... Ooh... Yeah... #
raise the curtain.
# I need a tough lover, yeah... Ooh... #
# When he kises me, I get that thrill. #
# When he does that wiggle I won't keep still. #
# I wanna a tough lover. Yeah... Ooh... #
# The seven sisters got nothing on him. #
# I'm talking about a lover who's fast as the wind. #
# Everyone will talk about how he got me fixed. It ain't a voodoo, it's just that twist. #
# He will be the greatest lover that ever come to pass. Don juan ain't got the half the chance. #
# He's a tough lover. Yeah... Ooh... #
# He'll make me laugh, he'll make me cry. He'll be so tough he'll make Venus come alive. #
# He'll do anything that he wants to do. Step on Jesse James's blue suede shoes. Yeah... #
# A tough lover. Yeah... Ooh... #
Oh, my God.
hold on. Am I the only one that has no idea what just happened?
whatever it was...
Oh, Tess, the music stopped, l didn't know what else to do.
I just had to sing, I'm sorry.
never told me you could sing like that.
I tried to tell you.
okay, okay. All right.
this is what we're gonna do. You guys know the songs, right?
Oh, yeah.
okay. So tomorrow we're gonna rehearse all day long, then tomorrow night you're gonna sing.
we're gonna go straight through the show live.
so any questions? - No.
okay, good. Okay, good. Alright, you go with the guys.
find out what keys you're comfortable singing the songs in...
and I'm going to go up to my office and plan an entirely new show.
okay? - Oh, my God.
Thanks, Tess.
I'm gonna build a show around her.
they don't come to hear us sing?
they'll come to hear her sing.
so how do you feel?
amazing. - Honey, I've never seen anything like that.
Thanks. Are you sure Tess really liked it? She wasn't...?
I was bringing down the curtain.
she stopped me. She's the one who let you sing.
Really? - She wants to build a whole show around you.
you're crying with happiness, right?
good. Okay.
Brava.
clearly one of us has underestimated the other.
wow, I can't believe Tess has you buried in the kick line.
she didn't know I sang.
well, you certainly can.
and you are way too good to be doing it here.
how about a drink?
the bar's right over there.
tell Jack I sent you.
where the hell did that come from?
I mean who knew that you could do that? - Thanks, Jack.
who know any white chick could sing like that?
how do you do that?
I don't know. It just happens. I just do it.
I know how that feels. I gotta pee again, so...
stop.
we're gonna get something to eat.
you wanna come?
Yeah, I would.
let's go.
look at you.
what? What?
well, no, just the way you're gazing after her.
I have a fiancee, remember?
Yes. No, I do. I know. Three thousand miles away.
we still talk every day.
you do? About what?
let me guess, don't tell me.
about her.
her.
and, I don't know...
her.
all I'm saying is that that one there is beautiful on the inside as well...
and she's not going to be available forever.
relationship advice from Mr. One-Night-Stand himself.
that is...
forgot my purse.
what? - Oh, no.
I was just telling Jack here how every opportunity has a shelf life.
come here.
look there.
awfully pretty, but too much.
see, I like that.
no, I'm not cutting my hair.
who said anything about you cutting your hair? You can wear a wig.
I'm wearing one right now.

so, what do you think?
I think you look...
I mean, it looks...
Jack, we're friends, for chrissake.
it's not like we're brother and sister.
no, we certainly are not.
I don't get why everyone's having a conniption over her.
she's just a tacky farm girl from Iowa.
and we know a cow when we see one.
don't underestimate us farm girls.
Vince.
this round's on me.
I don't normally do this...
but, Vince, I'm doubling my offer.
it's either you or the auction house.
no, I am not selling.
you know what happens when you default on a loan?
no, hum a few bars.
I'm not screwing around here. Where's the money gonna come from?
Ali's a hit. We can charge 50 bucks a head now.
raising the admission? That's not good enough.
you have been saying that the sky is falling forever.
and everything always works out fine.
tell that to the people that are losing everything.
I don't wanna be one of them.
and I love this place too. - No, you don't.
I do. - No, you don't!
Yes, I do! - Oh, no, you don't.
look, you have many fine qualities, Vincent.
and then you've got some iffy qualities.
but you've never been a phony.
just tell Marcus no.
Jack?
Yep. Just got in.
I'm in here. Can you come zip me up?
Hey, where you been?
writing music.
can I hear?
it's not ready. - It's not ready.
who's that?
me and my mom on my 7th birthday.
she died a few weeks later.
you must miss her.
every single day something happens that I wish I could tell her about.
and what happened today?
nothing yet.
you should get that. It's probably Natalie.
probably.
Hey, babe.
Yes, I know.
# A guy what takes his time, I'll go for any time #

# Who would qualify, no alibi, to be the guy who takes his time #
I'm starved. You ready?
I can't. I'm so sorry. I have to do inventory tonight.
want me to call you a cab?
no, that's okay. I'll get a ride with Coco.
sorry.
watch your back. Coming through.
you ready?
for what? - I'll drop you off.
Coco left five minutes ago.
I was coming over to talk to you. I caught the end of your conversation.
talk to me about...? - Dinner. With me. Give me that.
if you ever expect to see this bag alive again...
you'll follow me.
hold on a second. Where you going? Hey!
where are you taking me? This is not the way to my place.
I told you. Dinner.
dinner?
I'm not going to dinner with you. You're seeing Nikki.
we're just friends.
where I come from, friends don't chew on each other's earlobes.
aren't you glad you left?
Oh, damn it. - What?
I just remembered I gotta make a quick appearance at a party.
you just remembered.
it's on the way. We'll be quick. Ten minutes, tops. Do you mind?
and if I do?
then you've been kidnapped.
Hey, Marcus.
wow, Nice house.
what are you doing? You can't just take that.
put that back. You're gonna get us kicked out of here.
not if we sneak out first, come on.
Hey, hey. Greg, Marla, this is Ali.
Hi. - Hey.
Oh my God, those are amazing shoes.
aren't they? Louboutin.
great party.
always good to have you, man.
wait a minute. You had to make an appearance at your own party?
would've been rude not to, right?
you'd like those guys. Greg's an editor of the Times, Marla's a designer.
I'm gonna dream about those shoes.
wow, L. A. looks gorgeous from up here.
that view cost me three times what the house did.
see that strip mall down there?
you own that too?
no. I own everything above it.
there is nothing above it. - Exactly.
so you own air. - Air rights.
guy that owns the strip mall ran into money issues, almost had to sell.
whoever he sold it to would have put up a huge tower.
so I bought the air rights.
now no one can ever build above one story. - Well, aren't you clever?
mall guy gets to keep his property, I get to keep the second best view in L. A.
what's the first?
how many girls have you used that line on? - None whoever called me on it.
what do you want, Ali?
in life.
and why should I tell you?
you're talented enough to get whatever you want...
and I'm smart enough to make it happen.
somebody got a package. - Ali.
Ali. - Who's it from?
come on, open it. - Let's see. Come on.
Oh, my God.
those are so cute.
they're so pretty. - Those are so pretty.
who's the sucker?
let's go. Girls, please, break it up. Come on, come on.
Coco, let's go. Five minutes.
ali Cat, you're up next.
Oh, my nana used to call me Ali Cat.
did she really? That's so fascinating.
why don't I have a nickname? - Oh, you do.
well, he never uses it. - No, I do.
when?
when you leave the room.
slut. - I heard that.
so sorry! I had no idea! Oh, my God.
girls, come on! We have a show to do! Let's go, let's go!
hurry up! Come on!

Marcus.
went to a party.
Marcus?
new shoes?
Yeah.
classy.

there's only one reason a man buys a woman shoes.

you're getting more than a little.
not from anyone that matters.
I just think you should be careful.
and I think that if you really feel the need to tell a girl what she should and shouldn't do...
you should pick up the phone and call your fiancee.

that's major. My goodness.
major? Check again. The only thing major is the size of Coco's ass.
Monsieur Louboutin is at Table 18 and he's asking for you.
it's a weird angle.
I'm so glad you got to...
there she is, the girl of the hour.
I am starting to think that you'd go to any length.
I just made a call with Greg at the Times.
I want you to meet a friend of mine. Ali Rose, Harold Saint.
Harold...? Shut up. You worked with Etta James.
her. Chewed me up and spat me out, that one.
hello.
you've got a set of pipes on you too, young lady.
Thanks.
we have to do something about that.
you snooze, you lose, pretty boy.
standing room only.
I know. Doesn't it look great?
but I just got another notice from the bank.
we would have to fill Dodger Stadium for a month to come up with the cash.
I just gotta figure out a way to buy us more time.
Hey. - Hey.
that really is a great shot.
it's so weird seeing myself in the paper like that.
well, you might have to get used to it.
I don't think I ever could.
you know, I don't wanna come off like the wise old fairy godmother...
but maybe you could learn from my mistakes.
what do you mean?
you gotta learn who are the people that you can trust...
who are the people who really like you for you...
and who are the people who just want something from you.
you don't like Marcus, do you? - No, I don't.
I don't like him. I don't trust him.
I don't think you should trust him.
but is that really what's best for me or what's best for you?
I don't know.
I hope it's best for both of us.
all right.
see you tomorrow.
Ah, there you are.
these babies desperately need your glue gun, okay?
especially this one. - Okay.
okay? - Yep.
she's not going anywhere.
good night. - Night.
Oh, hey, Tess.
I got that track you wanted to rehearse for tomorrow night's show.
Jesus.
honey, I'm sorry. I got a million things on my mind and I completely forgot.
it's all good.
hmm, if it's too late now I guess can come in early tomorrow morning?
no, no. Let's just get it out of the way.
you want a spot?
Yeah.

# Don't count me out just yet #

Tess, we need to talk. - No.
Yes. - I'm tired, Nikki.
well, then you can just listen.
we built this club together...
and then some girl shows up from out of nowhere...
who hasn't even paid her dues... - How do you know what dues she's paid?
this chick doesn't sing that way because she's had it easy.
they don't come to hear us sing, Nikki.
or is that just bullshit now?
you know, you're drunk. Go inside and call a cab.
I will not be upstaged by some slut with music lungs!
then leave.
you'd ruin our friendship over some girl you barely know?
so much for loyalty!
since when did you know anything about loyalty?
how many goddamned times have I peeled you off the sidewalk?
how many blackouts?
how many times have I held your head over the toilet pole while you threw up everything but your memories?
okay, fine! But I will not stand in the back!
Tess, you need to fix this...
you think you're my only problem? I'm about to lose my club.
I'm about to lose the only thing that means anything to me.
I have more to worry about than try to keep you from pouring tequila on your Cheerios.
fine.
I quit! - I'm glad!
Nikki, don't drive.
by the way...
I slept with Vince the night after your honeymoon.
you crazy bitch!
morning.
do you really have to do that at 6 a. m?
coffee?
no, but a little peace and quiet would be nice.
you are a little overdressed for breakfast.
my pajamas were in the bedroom, which was occupied.
you're never here, so I figure it'd be stupid for me to crash on the couch when there is a perfectly good, empty bed right there.
so, what do you want, the bedroom back? Is that what you're saying?
should be used by someone.
I'm home every night.
maybe not when you think I should be. But last I checked, you are my roommate, not my mother.
however, since it's such an issue...
what the hell. Take the bedroom. I'll sleep on the couch. I don't care.
fine! - Fine!
you're gonna have to move your shit. - I realize that.
see? It's a total mess in there.
you got stuff everywhere. Clothes, shoes, hair...
Jesus! Jack! What is your problem? You're acting like a total prick.
is there something you wanna say?
it's not just me.
the people that care about you are worried.
what people?
people, you know? People. Your friends at the club.
we're like a family there.
and we look out for each other.
right, you all look out for each other. Like Vince looks after Tess.
and like Nikki looks out for everybody.
and Marcus? He's gonna look out for you?
no, it's fine. It's fine.
he can make things happen for you.
so go ahead, make a deal with the devil.
first of all, Marcus is not the devil.
he's a smart businessman...
who, oh, oddly enough, happens to be a gentleman who knows what he wants and he goes for it.
I'm just saying. Life is about the choices you make.
the choices I make?
you're a bartender/piano player...
who writes songs that are never ready.
Wow. That's perfect. Perfect.
please, try not to destroy my apartment. Thanks.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
you may kiss the bride.
wait, what do you mean you are still in New York? Why?
so you just decided not to come?
why does every conversation we have end up being about viewing your future?
you know what, you're right.
we should definitely start thinking about our futures.
and I might just be looking at mine right now.
that DJ is hot.
you think so?
he keeps looking at me.
maybe he's cuckoo for Coco Puffs.
Really? You think?
Yeah. I think.
he's gorgeous. I think he likes me.
he is gorgeous.
who is paying for this wedding anyway? This rental must have cost a fortune.
Damon's dad is loaded.
is he single?
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.
guess Georgia's not as dumb as I thought.
would you ever do this again?
no.
you know, there's only one man that I could see spending the rest of my life with.
and unfortunately, except for a really drunk night in Reno 25, 000 years ago...
he bats for the other team.
Oh, no. He bats for the pink team.
Yes.
that is tragique.
I know.
well, it's like all truly great love affairs.
Yeah.
tragic.
it wasn't Reno. It was Tahoe, baby.
and it was lovely.
get a room.
get away.
shot of Patrón, please.
make it two. Make it two.
looking kind of lonely there, Jack.
liberated, maybe.
Libated, definitely.
but lonely, no. Never lonely.
Cheers.
clink.
how's it going?
God. What are we, in junior high?
iowa, are you still mad at me?
you know, because if you are...
bring it on, baby.
are you drunk?
Oh, I love this song. Yes!
Oh, you rock.
Yeah, baby. You rock.
I'm sorry for being a class-A prick.
you were.
I was.
and, as of about some time ago, I am officially a single man.
you and Natalie broke up?
that we did.
which explains why I am here alone.
so...
why are you here alone?
do I really look alone to you?
come here.
Jack.
careful.
Oh, my feet are killing me. Take off these shoes, please. Help me.
wait, wait. Be careful.
I got it. No. No.
stay.
good night.
here. Yeah.
night.
okay.
cute jammies.
my mother got me these, thank you very much.
and I haven't worn them yet, so...
go figure.
I forgot to lock the door.
got it? - Good.
good night.
back again?
water. Don't want a hangover.
smart.
good night. Again.
night. Again.
now, I know... I know I forgot something else.
I remember I locked the door.
that's it. Hungry. I'm hungry.
exactly.
what is so funny? - Jack! Well, you're...
well, I never.
Jack. - Want a cookie?
no?
all right. - Jack.
it's your loss. You change your mind...
you know where they are.
# Sweet love, sweet love #
# Trapped in your love #
# I've opened up #
# Unsure I can trust #
# My heart and I were buried in dust #
# Free me free us #
so it's official.
what?
you are definitely not gay.
so, what about Natalie?
Natalie who?
# I found a man I can trust #
# And, boy, I believe in us #
# I am terrified to love for the first time #
# Can you see that I'm bound in chains #
# I finally found my way #
# I am bound to you, I am bound to you #
# So much, so young #
# I've faced on my own #
do that again.
# Walls I built up became my home #
now come here.
# I'm strong and I'm sure there's a fire in us #
# Sweet love, so pure #
# I catch my breath with just one beating heart #
# And I brace myself, please don't tear this apart #
I mean, I don't really know what happened.
I had won the Nashville Teen Songwriting Contest.
I even still have my little trophy.
so I took that as...
I thought I was supposed to do something important with my life.
then I got to L. A.
and nothing happened.
nothing.
well, you know what?
I believe your music is ready.
the question is...
are you ready?
for what? - Are you ready? Here I come.
# Suddenly the moment's here #
# Do I risk it all #
# Come this far just to fall, fall #
# Oh, I can trust #
# And boy, I believe in us #
# I am terrified to love for the first time #
# Can you see that I'm bound in chains #
# And finally found my way #
# I am bound to you #
# I am, ooh, I am #
# I'm bound to you #
I knew it. - Natalie.
you are a liar. A pathetic, sneaky little liar!
what is she doing here?
I live here. I wanna know why you are here.
I can't believe I bought your bullshit.
she's nothing. She's just a girl I work with.
she's not even pretty.
well, at least you were honest about one thing.
you said that? - No, I did not.
he did. - No, I didn't.
Yes, he said that. - Look...
I'm sorry, could you just give me some time...?
you're asking me to leave?
no. - Yes, you. I'm the fiancee.
you told me you broke it off with her. - I did.
you break up with me over the phone?
I'm out of here. You told me it was over. - No. Ali.
ali, please. - What, Jack?
I am sorry. - So am I.
I'm out.
ali, wait. Please.
I must have the wrong apartment.
who are you looking for?
I'm looking for Sean. - Sean.
what's he look like?
yea high.
shaved head.
brown eyes. Glasses.
Sean.
I've been calling him John.
no, it's Sean.
is that him?
Yeah.
Hi.
what are you doing here? - It's a long story.
I shouldn't have come here.
I see I've obviously interrupted something.
might be a bad time.
no, that's okay.
I'm sorry. Ali, did you meet...
Mike? - Close. My name is Mark.
Hi, Mark.
sorry.
does anybody want any coffee?
Yeah. Why don't I go make the coffee...
and you guys get better acquainted.
sorry. Did I call you Mike last night?
Yes. Yeah.
but I called you John, so... - Really?
you liked it.
John was my mother's name.
Hey. - Hey, gorgeous.
Hey, Marcus.
you okay? You sound down.
I've been better.
well, I have just the cure.
what's that? - Me.
why don't you come over for dinner?
okay, well...
Bye. - Yeah, bye. You...
you take care...
Sean. - You too. Okay.
okay, bye.
is Ali here?
ali left.
she went with Marcus.
is that true?
Yeah.
what? - She left a couple hours ago.
I told you that opportunity wouldn't knock forever.
you're right. It doesn't.
Hey.
you.
it's Mark.
mark.
do you want to have some lunch?
Yeah. Sure.
you're cooking.
I just wasted my whole goddamn afternoon talking with the vice president of loans.
this asshole... No, wait. He didn't even look me in the eye.
he just sat there, playing with this wooden thingy on his desk.
what thing? What? - The long wooden block thingy.
the nameplate?
Yes. Nameplate.
Yeah, and?
and he's not gonna give me the money.
are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.
I'm not a good risk.
and I've got two days before the bank takes the club.
well, then...
I would say that the situation is pretty bleak.
and I would say that you are a master of the fucking obvious.
why did you say that?
what do you mean, "Why did I say that"? Because it's the truth.
Tess, it's not a judgment, it's the truth.
you don't have any money.
the bank won't give you a loan. It's the eleventh hour.
Hello?
if I were you, I would take Marcus's offer now.
no.
and you don't get to say that to me.
I can take "the sky is falling" from everyone else, but not you.
you know, I need you to be the one that says:
it's only a number, Tess.
we have killed ourselves trying to keep this place going.
how can you just walk away?
I don't care if you walk away, I don't care what happens.
I will beat down the door of every bank in L. A.
I will never give up this club.
are you sure?
I will never give it up.
there she is.
I thought I'd lost you for a minute at the beginning there.
you are such an asshole.
thank you.
hope you're hungry.
steaks are on.
what is this?
right now it's a model.
when it grows up it'll be multi-use space...
residential, retail.
but this is the address of Burlesque Lounge.
best view on the Sunset Strip with no windows.
when I'm through with it, it'll have a thousand.
does Tess know about this?
Tess knows I've made an offer to buy. - What makes you think she'd sell?
I don't think she has a choice. She's going under. I'm giving a very generous offer.
it's a win-win situation for everyone. It's business, not personal.
I think it's personal for Tess.
and for Coco and Sean and...
what about me?
there are other clubs that you can sing and dance in. Better ones.
you don't get it.
I don't understand. I'm trying to do something that benefits everyone.
how does that make me the bad guy? - It doesn't, Marcus.
it just makes you the wrong guy.
Hi.
so how'd it go at the bank?
this good.
you want a glass for that?
no, no. I am way beyond a glass.
Tess, I gotta talk to you. - Not right now.
Marcus is gonna tear down the club and build a skyscraper.
and how do you know this?
I saw the model. - I didn't know you and Marcus are that close.
we're not that close. I rushed over so I could tell you.
you're spreading yourself a little bit thin.
Jack, Marcus, whoever.
Tess, I'm trying to help you.
let it go. - She's gotta listen to me.
okay. Let it go, let it go.
Sean, she needs to listen to me. - But she can't right now.
well, she's gonna hear me. Watch this.
Tess, I gotta talk to you.
you could knock. This is still my office for 48 hours.
well then you really need to hear what I have to tell you.
no, I don't. I am tired of talking. I am talked out.
this time, you're gonna hear me out. - I don't wanna hear you out.
do you ever listen to anything other than your own voice?
talk.
have you ever heard of air rights?
no, I've never heard of air rights. What are air rights?
now, that's funny.
Jim, let me call you back, huh?
please sit down, ladies.
a few years ago you wanted to buy my club and I said no.
Yeah, and now you changed your mind?
no, but just bear with me for a second...
because I promise this is gonna have a happy ending for both of us.
how much you planning to sell your condos for?
well, they start at a million and go up from there, depending on the view.
that's beautiful.
so, what if I told you that a 20-story office building was going up where my club is?
that would block his view.
ten stories would block his view. - Yeah. Gone.
the way I see it, your beautiful million-dollar ocean and city views...
are just gonna vanish into thin air.
vanish. - Yeah.
because tomorrow I am going to sell my club to this developer...
and his 20 stories are gonna be well underway by the time you start selling.
trying to sell. - Yeah. Right.
and so I think that we should talk.
I'd listen to her.
we're gonna have to auction off everything.
anything you want me to keep for you?
no.
I just wanna try and do what's best for both of us.
you gonna shoot me? Please?
no. I'm gonna buy you out.
in the next 24 hours?
no, in the next 24 seconds.
where did you get this?
thin air.
Oh, baby.
thank you.
just put it out in the universe.
what would really make me so happy...
is to hear from you...
a great, big, giant, fat:
thank you, Ali.
I didn't sleep with Vince, I just said that to hurt you.
I crossed the line.
you think?
I wanna come home.
okay, you're home.
now get your crazy-ass upstairs and get ready, you're on in 20 minutes.
and if you ever pull half of the crap that she pulled...
you are gonna be out so quick it's gonna make your head spin.
Yes, ma'am.
and don't ever call me "ma'am" again.
I'm gonna go get dressed for the show.
thank you, Ali.
so this is what happens when you get a little money?
you stop doing manual labor.
I'm back there with broken zippers...
and ostrich feather fans that won't open or close.
you have no idea what it's like. No idea.
I quit. Quit.
can I use this? - Don't touch my stuff.
I've been looking for you.
well, you found me.
I wanna talk to you.
Jack, I really have to get ready. Okay?
I know I messed up, okay? Bigtime.
when? When you lied to me about your engagement being over...
or when you kicked me out of your apartment?
it really was over. Okay? And she's gone.
I'm here to apologize.
no, no. Hey.
I never should have let you walk out that door.
go on.
I want you to come back.
so, what's the proposal, exactly?
well...
I still have that full box of cookies.
and an empty day bed.
I want the bedroom.
half.
so are you in or are you out?
Oh, Jack. Now, see...
I'm the kind of girl that, when a friend's in trouble, I help.
that's just who I am.
shut up.
okay, then. All right.
I...
I finished a song.
I think it's pretty good.
can I hear it? - No.
but you can sing it.

I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate, someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
my name is Tom Strickler.
what is it that you do, Tom?
a bit like an agent.
Strickler agent to the spies.
like I told you before, I'm not interested in your money.
it's all about the burn notice with you, isn't it?
I think I might be able to help with that.
the fact that he's a weasel doesn't give you pause?
it doesn't feel right, promise me you'll walk away.
Fi, I have to go.
you do this, and you have my word.
the powers that be will review your burn notice.
for you. Happy birthday.
yeah? - Michael.
Diego Michael's agency contact.
I just got a call from Washington.
there's been some movement on your burn notice.
this is just the beginning, superstar.
I just can't stay here in miami and watch.
when you work as a covert operative, there's no line between who you are and what you do.
you are who you need to be for the operation.
it makes you effective.
it keeps things simple.
but when you spend so much time living as someone else, sometimes the people you care about most begin to wonder who you really are.
I'm upstairs, Fi.
what's that you're driving?
it didn't sound like your car outside.
it's a rental.
I sold my car.
Really?
your car didn't exactly have a pink slip.
Oh, the buyer didn't mind.
not at that price.
this, um... this moving-out-of-town thing... if you're trying to make a point -
I'm not trying to make a point, Michael.
I'm trying to make a change.
I'm going home.
I told my mother to expect me.
we had one fight, and you decide to go back to Ireland?
this isn't about one fight, Michael.
if you didn't see this coming, then you weren't paying attention.
you're too worried about your own future for there to be one for us.
I'm not doing this for me.
Fiona, I'm out in the cold, and the longer I stay there, the more I endanger everyone in my life.
don't you pretend this is about us. It's about you!
which is fine.
it's -- it's just time I-I did what I need to do, too.
Yeah.
have you seen my h&k U.S.P. Compact, the one with the silver slide?
I need to finish packing, and I think I must have left it here.
Yeah. I, uh... I think I saw it around here somewhere.
I'll find it, and I'll bring it to you, okay?
you're not leaving today, are you?
no.
someone must have made themselves a powerful new friend.
it's not every day the guy running the agency warehouse in miami gets a call from the deputy director.
so?
your file just landed on his desk.
so, this is being taken seriously.
over my strenuous objection.
but I seem to be the only one who thinks this is a waste of the agency's time.
great. So, uh, will you be the one running my review?
I'm just the liaison.
various regional experts will be doing your review.
they'll get to tear apart the story of poor, misunderstood Michael Westen and put you on the blacklist for good.
you know, if I were you, Diego, I'd start preparing myself for disappointment.
funny.
I was gonna give you the same advice.
I'll be calling you to set up the first meeting soon.
don't you want to wish me luck?
not really.
but I'm supposed to tell you to stay out of trouble.
you're tiptoeing through a minefield.
there's a reason spies try to stay detached.
when you get emotional about something, even if it's just your ex-girlfriend's 45-caliber handgun, you get distracted.
and getting distracted can be very, very dangerous.
you remember my brother Sean?
you met back in Ireland.
Sean Glenanne Fiona's brother
it's been a while.
last I saw you, you were saving my sister from those English bastards that had her pinned down in Belfast.
spies need to remember every cover I. D.
they've ever worn because you never know when you might need to put one back on.
Yeah. It was a good thing they were such lousy shots.
otherwise, Fiona and I would have been saying our last hail marys together.
glad you're here.
we could use another man who can shoot a gun.
Why's that?
it's bad news, Mcbride.
someone's coming to kill my sister.
this is it? Don't you have any real guns?
I am in the middle of a move.
all of my big toys are packed up on a boat, waiting to be smuggled back.
america's taken its toll, sis.
you've lost your edge and your accent.
O'neill is looking for an Irish woman.
I'm not gonna hold up a neon sign that says,"here I am! Come blow my head off!"
look, I'm way behind, and it sounds like I can't afford to be, so start from the beginning.
his name is Thomas O'neill -- one of those ultraradical bastards - the kind of man who would blow up a church on a sunday, kind of man I'd love to kiss with a chain saw.
and why does he want you dead, Fi?
it's a long story.
talk quickly, then.
you don't need a history lesson, mcbride.
all that matters is O'neill's supposed to be making his move today, and we're not suitably armed.
I'll make a call.
I know someone who delivers.
we'll need some proper hardware.
how quick can they get here?
not quick enough.
is that him?
that's Thomas O'neill.
bloodthirsty hooligan got here faster than I expected.
thomas O'neill bloodthirsty hooligan
we need to move now.
no. I'm gonna teach the son of a bitch how to breathe through the top of his skull.
we're outnumbered. Do the math.
they think Fiona's alone.
we can dig in, surprise them.
no, we can't. That's a trained extraction team.
we leave now or we die.
there's one on the corner. He didn't see us.
well, he's seen us now.
they came out the back.
she's on foot, and she's not alone.
spread out, sweep the neighborhood.
come on, come on, come on!
we need a car now.
I'll get us one. Stay here.
you never told him!
no, Michael, not even a glenanne would forgive me for working with an american spy.
everyone at home still thinks you're from Kilkenny.
Sean can never know.
don't worry. He won't.
he better not.
Hey, mike. How you - - Sam, we have a situation.
someone's in town trying to kill Fi.
her brother Sean has come into town to protect her, so we need a place to lay low.
Jesus. Okay. Let me make a call.
Thanks, and, Sam?
what have I told you about my time in Ireland?
uh, not much, Mike.
well, my name is Michael Mcbride, and you're just gonna have to roll with it.
you must be Sean.
I'm Sam Axe.
okay, Sam.
what's your background?
we're doing background checks now?
mcbride knows me.
well, I don't know you. So, why don't...
that's enough, Sean. I trust him. Fiona trusts him. Now so do you.
we good here?
Yeah. It's a new foreclosure.
my real-estate buddy doesn't expect anybody herefor at least a month.
better not take that longto get rid of O'neill.
so, why is this guyso hot for you, Fi?
I thought you bit the heads offall your old boyfriends.
I met O'neill while I was looking for the man who killed my sister.
you had a sister?
you nevermentioned that before.
I don't like to talk about it.
there were seven of us --five boys, two girls.
Claire was the youngest.
when she was taken, I was angry and I was loud.
O'neill thoughtI was as radical as he was, and he told m eabout a bombing he was planning at a prep school.
and you made sure those explosives never made it to the target.
a few years later, he resurfaced and came after me.
it's one of the reasons that I left home.
after Fi left, O'neill disappeared again.
I hoped he'd blown himself up, but then word got out Fi was in touch with folks in Dublin.
suddenly O'neill's back on the grid and on his way to Miami.
right. Fiona? You and Sean will stay at the house. Sam and I...
to hell with that!
with four of us looking, we'll find him much faster.
he knows you and Sean.
McBride, if you think you're dealing with him all by yourself - we'll discuss the dealing when we do the finding.
but Sam and I are doing the finding.
first, you say run.
now you say hide.
I crossed an oceanto tear a man's limbs off.
there's no pointin fighting with him.
trust me.
I am not one of your damn clients.
Fiona the client
so, do we love this place or what?
I almostdidn't go for it, but then I thought,"I'm worth it."
well, you are, Strickler.
look, uh, my day just got crazy, so...
Oh, no time for a tour, huh?
uh, well, whenever you're ready, it'll be here.
so, uh, you know howthis is gonna work, right?
apparently, they're gonna look at my activities when I was regularly employed.
but I get to set the record straight.
Yeah, well, "straightish"might be a better term.
what does that mean?
well, they're delicate issues -- phrases to avoid, phrases to employ.
it needs proper handling.
Truthdoesn't need handling.
the truth?
Oh, come on.
you are not in the truth business, Michael. You never were.
look, partners have to trust each other, so trust me when I say that right now your reputation is valuable.
people fear you. We can use that to make you money.
Michael, did you really think rebuilding a reputation would be free?
money greases palms, opens doors, buys documents, and it puts Michael Westen right back where he wants to be.
now, understand, this project is very delicate, so let's not break it.
I'm gonna send you some paperwork tomorrow -- your side of the story.
study up.
Hey, Mikey.
this is Thomas O'neill's interpol file?
Yeah, you think a guy who crossed an ocean to kill Fi would have a file with a little more meat on its bones.
that's it.
I thought he was supposed to be this one-man, ultraradicalsplinter group.
well, he's got the reputation, but not the rap sheet.
this looks likehe's not tied to anything.
he isn't.
Interpol thinks he's free lancing.
they like him for about 12 bombings in Europe, all with the same chemical signature, but nobody can pin anything on the guy.
O'neill has some known associates in the states. They're money guys.
one of them just bought a condoin south beach.
my bet is it's not a vacation home.
we should get eyes on it.
what are you two doing? Would you put those things away?
mom, wait. Mom.
Hey, come on in.
Boys...this is Tiffany.
hi -- Tiffany Ward. Tiffany Ward realty.
mom, are you selling the house?
I was thinking about it.
and with you about to get your old job back and Fi heading home, I just thought maybe it was about time that I made a change myself.
can we start in the bedrooms?
sure. Yeah, they're in the back.
I raised two boys here.
the way they behaved, it was more like four.
so, I think a large family can live here very comfortably.
this house is just filledwith so much love and -- and...
not now, Mikey. We got to go.
I'm just saying, Mike, it's okay if your head is spinning.
I mean, first it's your girl, now it's your childhood home.
I never liked that house.
Yeah, but you like Fiona, right?
there's O'neill.
why does it look like the sons of the lucky charms revolution are getting ready for battle?
because he knows Fionais on his tail.
that's her in the sedan.
Aw, crap.
she must have tracked O'neill through his Miami connections.
she went around me!
Mike, she thinks that he's alone.
she has no idea what she's getting into.
it's gonna be world war III down there.
O'neill is mine.
I'll give you first shot, but when you miss because you broke a nailor dropped your purse, I'll step in and clean him up for you.
she's not picking up.
Sam, give me the keys to the car.
that's Miss Reynold's car.
the keys! Now!
no, don't. Mike.
Hello, gorgeous.
I've been waiting for this.
they knew we were coming.
no.
what the hell?
back inside now!
sorry about the buick, Sam. There was just no other way.
Oh, just...don't.
what part of "Sam and I will do the finding" was unclear?
you get on my page now, or someone's getting killed.
no more ignoring your phone. No more running off without...
McBride, stop your lecturing. Why do you think we're here?
we came to apologize and say thanks.
I mean, I'm not thrilled that the bastard's still breathing, but I'm --I'm glad that we are.
Sam - - oh, please. I've been dodging miss Reynold's calls for an hour.
I'm sure the cops ran the plateson the buick, told her -
Oh, wait. Here we go.
Oh, yeah. That's her - again.
now that we found O'neill, how exactly are we dealing with him?
well, he needs to find you.
he'll want to talk to anyone who could help him with that, which gives met he in I need to get him and his whole team busted by the police.
McBride, you can't just walk right up to him.
as soon as you open your mouthand he hears you're Irish -
I'll approach him as an american with a deal.
Really?
sure you can pull that off?
I've gone undercover as an American before.
I'll be fine.
I don't know.
your accent is a bit dodgy.
uh, the uninvited could at least have the decency to introduce himself.
my name's unimportant.
you're sittingat the wrong table.
fellas, get him out of here.
I assure you I'm not. This is the planning committee for the Glenanne wake, right?
easy.
what are you gonna do -- you gonna play me a song with that?
what's he gonna do?
funny.
I want you to tell me if you recognize this voice.
O'neill should be in the ground.
he and his bloody army were ready for us.
we need to leave town now.
I own a company.
I'm an arms dealer.
if it goes "boom" or "bang" or helps unhappy peoplekill each other, I sell it.
miss Glenanne works for me.
Yeah, whatever, pal. I couldn't care less about your business.
I want to know how you come to have her voice on tape.
my line of work breeds distrust, which is why I monitor communications.
what did I hear when I listened in on Miss Glenanne?
an Irish man named Thomas O'neill has come with a small army to Miami to kill her.
you got a lot of brass on you, fella.
I'll give you that.
now it won't surprise you to learn I can make her appear whenever I want, wherever I choose.
well, Mr. Magic man, if you make her appear now, I'll buy you a mighty fine drink.
I wish it were that simple.
but she's doing a job for me.
if she disappears, I need someone to do what she no longer can.
I was thinking of you.
I don't deal with peopleI don't know.
you should get to know me.
I don't think I will.
I found her once.
I'll find her again.
well. If that doesn't work outfor you, call me.
Slinte.
Slinte.
I thought the Irish were impulsive.
okay, so, where are we if he doesn't go for your proposition?
in need of a backup plan.
well, maybe we should ask Fi.
she might have a perspective that we don't.
that's the real-estate lady!
butch, Sundance, cool it.
Hey, make sure to tell her about the quality craftsmanship in the new sun-room.
you here about the house?
no, I'm here about your son.
can Michael come out and play?
what the hell are you doing here?
exactly what I said I would do -- delivering your study materials.
here it is.
exactly what you're going to tell our friends at the C.I.A.
you want me to say I worked a job helping a Somali warlord?
somali businessman. Yeah.
it's an intelligence asset.
it was a real operation.
lucky for us, all the U. S. Operatives died, so nobody can say you weren't there, lines up perfectly with your time in africa, and it helps me to set up a little side project I have here in Miami.
what side job?
too early to talk details.
let's focus on the, uh --the businessman.
he's agreed to vouch for your unimpeachable conducton the job for a price, which I will pay.
no sale.
I'm not clearing my name by getting in bed with a murderer.
stop being so naive.
you're just replacing one lie with another, and this lie washes you clean.
nothing about this is clean.
you need to realize that this isn't about telling the world the truth about Michael Westen.
this is about getting your old job back.
in the end, what does it matter?
Oh, and please tell your mom sorry about the drapes.
they looked better in the catalog, honestly.
you take that. We'll talk later.
yeah?
it's O'neill.
I've had a change of heart.
let's meet.
he didn't say why?
no.
he just said O'neill called him and we needed to be ready.
Fiona, why are you coming home without Mcbride?
people are who they are. They don't change just bcause you want them to.
so, you're still in love with him.
you ready?
of course.
where we headed?
I need O'neill to deliver a package for me.
what package?
a little gift with a big prison sentence attached to it. Let's go.
Michael. You know, I lost one sister.
I can't lose another.
I want to thank you for protecting Fiona.
you're an honest man, and I'm honored to be fighting beside you.
I'm glad you came to your senses.
well, we'll see.
now talk.
it's simple.
I'll give you Miss Glenanne's location, you get to kill her.
I deliver you the girl, and in return, you deliver a shipment of assault rifles to one of my buyers.
I got a better idea.
fellas?
I'm gonna shoot little bits off you until you tell me where she is.
where do you want it first?
you want your elbow or your bloody kneecap?
I really don't have time for this.
put the gun down, or I'll have you put down.
I'm not sure you've taken stock of the situation.
well, there you go, eh?
you couldn't be trusted, so I brought insurance.
take your hands off meand put the gun down.
gun going down.
very good.
you can follow orders.
now, tell me we have a deal.
if you stop lighting me up like a little christmas tree, then just maybe we will havea deal, yes.
all right, that's the signal.
turn them off.
Sean, what are you doing?
I can take them all out.
that is not a risk you get to take.
I just agreed to your deal.
simple miscommunication.
Sean, they're gonna kill Mcbride.
no. I can get them all.
Sean, turn the laser off.
this is your last chance, partner, or the deal dies right here.
so do you.
get this thing off me.
that's everything on your list.
time to bring Thomas O'neill's monster to life.
meet O'neill's signature bomb.
he's trotted that thing out 12 times and never been caught.
let's make lucky number 13 the one that links him to all his uncredited work.
Fiona, you remember Jack Tracey from the bicycle shop by the church?
just got off the phone with him.
the old guy. He was good to us.
right. Real plugged into the underground.
well, he's got bad news.
there's a rumor that O'neill's taking you home, putting you up for sale.
sounds like there's a number of folks with ample reason to hate Fiona Glenanneal ready showing an interest.
that could bea lot of people.
it seems O'neill's looking to raise his profile back home.
thinks you're his ticket.
I should have force-fed him a bullet when I had the chance.
if you had, you two would behaving this conversation alone.
I could have put them all down, Mcbride.
I had a clear shot.
did you have five clear shots?
I think you're over estimating your ability to hit five moving targets.
you think so? - I know so.
well, how about I -- - how about you shut up?!
we have work to do.
bomb makers, like master chefs, tend to have a signature dish.
if you can duplicate it, you can leave their fingerprint wherever you want.
some bombs are designed to remove an obstacle, some bombs are designed to be loud and scary, while other bombs are just designed to kill and maim.
rat poison?
it containsan anticoagulant.
he likes his victims to hemorr hage and bleed out.
he wants them to suffer.
he does it for the headlines and the pictures splashed on the front page.
he blows up people just to spread fear.
go.
pick up some screws while you're there.
you two play nice.
you think you can handle that?
guess we'll find out, Mcbride.
Hey, mom. Sorry I missed your calls.
I came by to see if you needed anything.
sure, you did.
that's why you're in here stealing all my screws.
it's all right.
I don't need to know.
let's just pretend that you're helping me clean my garage for my open house.
that sounds good.
so, uh, any other big life changes you want to tell your son about?
what?
I thought you'd be thrilled.
I know you never wanted to come back to this house again.
no, I didn't, but that's me.
you're the one who always insisted that every single memory we had here was a good one.
or did you suddenly change your mind?
maybe I finally decided to move on, Michael.
it's something I learned from my son, no doubt.
Anyway...I didn't want to feel bad about throwing this stuff out without showing it to you first, okay?
I just -- I ran across it when I was showing Tiffany around.
my model airplanes.
Yeah. There's another box just like it inside in the closet.
you don't want this stuff anymore?
I was hoping that you would, Michael.
this isn't gonna make any sense to you, but, um, most people --normal people...
go through their life collecting boxes like this.
I just don't want you to ever look back and regret letting this stuff go.
now, if you're convinced that you never will, I will throw it away for you.
I'll just -- I'll --I'll take a look.
Oh, well, I'll go get the other box.
well, this is gonna make O'neill look like he's go tone hell of an interest in the basement of the state department.
he's gonna have a lot of explaining to do.
that's the noose.
so, you think this slippery Irish man's gonna stick his head in?
if we want to get him busted, we need to put him behind the wheel of this van.
and if he won't do it on his own, we'll have to just gently encourage him.
McBride, I'll be right there.
right, Sean.
that's the last of what you packed.
it's such a shame to leave so much behind.
I was just getting comfortable.
I know you're trained to walk away from everything in 30 minutes or less, but it's not easy for everyone.
I can't believe in a few days I'm gonna wake up back home.
and you'll be you again, Fi.
I wonder what it will be like.
you'll have your friends there and your family.
they don't know me anymore.
you're still the same person.
no, I'm not.
who I am now has so much to do with what I've done here, what I've done with you.
Fi...I...
it's okay, Michael.
we're so not good at this.
McBride, everything taken are of?
Yeah, let's go then.
and, Sean, you have to stop parking your stolen car in the side streets.
it's too exposed.
what?
I left it in the parking lot this morning.
Oh, that's not your Toyota a block away, parked behind some trees?
get the girl! Get the girl out of here now!
No! No! He has to live!
you got some good friends, Westen.
Michael, thank god you're okay.
okay, just keep holding the pressure.
I am holding the pressure.
Oh, damn it. I can't get it.
where is she?
Yeah, hey, Mike, sorry about leaving you back there, but, uh, broken ribs weren't a priority.
you were breathing steady.
where is she?
I don't know. I got here, found Sean, called Maddie.
Sean wouldn't let Sam take him to the hospital.
he was saying if we got caught up explaining all this crapto the cops, we'd never find Fi.
push --push hard right here.
Yeah, okay. Why won't it stop?
how did O'neill find the safe...
all right, walk the perimeters and keep your radioson channel one.
Hello, sweetheart. This way. That's right. Come on in.
there you go.
stop your nonsense, sweetheart!
there we go.
Where's Fiona?
you tell me where Fiona is now!
I'll call you back.
now, how would I know that?
thomas O'neill stopped one of his men from executing me.
it sounded like he made a deal with someone to keep me alive.
I thought of you.
Bravo.
put that all together yourself, did you?
no point in denying it. You would have figured it out eventually.
you sent Fiona to her death.
I sent her home, like she wanted.
what happens after she gets there --well, she's a big girl.
Strickler, you have no I...
Hey, I did this the cleanest way possible.
sure, the brother got clipped, but you were spared.
I'm your goddamn white knight, Michael.
you tell me where -- - hey, hey! Get back.
get the hell back right now.
I'm getting a little sick of your ingratitude.
I'm the one trying to help you out.
you wanted back in?
well, guess what -- a gun-dealing, bomb-making girlfriend wasn't helping your case.
she had to go.
and it was clear you were too attached to do what needed to be done, so, like a good partner, I did it for you.
what the hell are you doing?
you're staying put for the next hour.
by then, the cargo company I hired will have Miss Glenanneand her fan club in international waters, heroic rescue attempts will be impossible, and you can move on knowing there wasn't a damn thing you could do.
I'll be the bad guy.
you're welcome.
tell me where she is.
get out of my way.
you don't get to have the girl and the job!
she doesn't fit into your future, our future.
so why don't you do yourself a favor and just forget the past?
Fiona is not my past.
Mike, where are you?
Sam, listen to me.
Strickler arranged for O'neill to get out of the U. S. on a cargo ship.
he's been making regular calls to a charter fishing house on key biscayne.
well, that must be where O'neill has Fi. It's perfect.
those places are secluded. They got private docks.
perfect place to load a prisoneronto our transport boat.
how's Sean?
Ah, he's stable.
I'm coming to get you.
this is the place.
Fi's still here.
you sure?
that's the fishing boat.
let's get that bomb in the bag and get it on the boat and call the coast guard and make sure the feds catch him with it this time.
God, I've waited a long time for this moment.
well, so have I.
in my version, I'm stabbing you in the throat with an ice pick.
is that how you saw it?
I can't say I did, no.
no, it wasn't like that.
but don't worry. You'll soon be spending quite a bit of time with some sharp metal instruments.
you're putting meon the auction block.
you're not man enough to do it yourself.
if this was just about youand me, I'd be holdinga bloody hammer, and you'd be choking ona mouthful of teeth -them little teeth there.
the thing is, it's bigger than us, you see?
when I set footon Irish soil, it's gonna be a whole new world for me because there are some very powerful men who are gonna give me anything I want in exchange for you.
you see?
even a seat at the table.
there's no place in Ireland for a bastard like you.
there's always room for a patriot.
you're no patriot.
you're a monster who wraps himself in a causeto justify murdering children!
even your own country wants you dead!
you're wrong!
you hit like a girl.
Sam, if anything happens to me -- - Oh, I'm finishing this, brother.
I'm getting Fi out of there no matter what.
just don't ever tell her I said that.
O'Neill, get out here.
what the hell's going on?
get to the boat. Get to the boat!
keep him covered!
get to the boat! Start the boat up!
Sam, Fiona's clear. Get them on the boat.
get in the water, you bastards! Go get her! She's gone!
forget her!
no, we need to getto the boat!
Sam, you got eyes on Fi?
I don't see her, mikey. I'm calling it in.
coast guard.
is this an emergency?
I just saw a group of menwith guns loading something onto a boat.
how are they?
better.
they've been asleep for hours.
Michael, I was supposed to havean open house here today.
I'm sorry, mom.
no. I've decided to take the listing off the market.
I don't think it's time for me to leave yet.
if that's what you think is best for you, mom.
it's not just doingwhat's best for me, michael.
you hide your clients here.
you let your friends stay here.
I don't think you're readyto say goodbye, either.
maybe you're right.
Michael, get over here.
so, it's Westen now, is it?
it has been for a while.
I owe you an explanation.
back in ireland, there were a lot of questions about whether or notyou were one of us.
I always thought you were.
now I know I was right.
thank you, sean.
the problem is O'neil louted you as an American.
you can never go back, and, uh, neither can she.
should I be looking outfor anyone?
no. I should be ableto keep them at bay.
I'll owe you for that.
the hell you will.
that squares us.
I heard what you did to strickler.
if you --if you need any help running...
Strickler's body was foundnext to a certain type of bomb.
our friend o'neillwill be charged with his murder and the 12 bombingsin europe.
that's betterthan he deserves.
but it'll do.
I wanted to, um... I wanted to...
don't...
it's okay. We're no good at this.
Diego, yeah I thought you forgot.
listen, michael, what were you doing workingwith tom strickler?
Yeah, it's complicated.
do you know the kind of peoplehe was in bed with, the kind of stuff he was involved in?
Diego, calm down.
Strickler's dead! He was shot to death!
now someone's in town cleaningup the mess he left behind!
I don't knowwho I can trust, even at the agency!
wait. Who's in town?
I don't know.
but I'm being followed, michael.
someone's coming for me, and they're coming for you, too.
we're not safe.
we need to meet now.
where are you?
3732 brighton avenue. Apartment 412.
I'll be right there.
we got a 1-8-7 down here.
we need to set up a perimeter and search the areafor suspects.
when you realize that an operation is compromised, that your enemies are on the move, you're on a clock.
you have to move as fast as you can to try to contain the damage and harden your defenses before it's too late.
sometimes you make it in time and sometimes you don't.
when you work in intelligence, the worst feeling in the world is knowing nothing, being caught up in something you don't begin to understand because it's not the enemy you see that gets you, it's the one you don't.
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies --a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
as a spy, you have a lot of ways to get information.
you can get it with a gun. You can get it with a lockpick.
you can get it with a listening device.
but most often, more than all the other information-gathering techniques combined, you get information with a free lunch.
how come you never invite me to lunch at places like this?
Oh, there's no need, Sam. You'll do almost anything for a $3 beer.
Yeah, sure.
Barry tracks down a Cayman Island bank account number, and he gets lunch at the Chadwick?
that number leads to whoever was trying to kill me, so, yes, the Chadwick.
he's been complaining about the job for days.
Yeah, and the squeaky wheel gets the surf and turf. I see how this works.
well, at least I can get a good mojito here.
we're on a budget, Sam.
okay, Mike, you know, this cancels out one of the times you saved my life
maybe two.
how did you get this mysterious bank account number?
you probably don't want to know.
I do. We don't have a lot of information.
well, that's why I'm coming to you. I just need a name.
Yeah, no, uh...
I understand why you hired me, Michael Westen.
but you're having me break a lot of laws with this job I'm doing for you.
when someone starts acting like there's an extra person in the conversation, it's a pretty good bet that they're wearing a wire.
this job you're doing for me?
the question, then, is who's taping you -- the police, the FBI...
I think we should talk later, maybe someplace louder.
Oh, Michael, Michael, I missed you.
or a government agent you blackmailed a while back and were hoping to never see again?
Sam Axe, you're living well off a government pension, I see.
not that good. This is iced tea.
remember the file I have on you, Bly?
I think the idea was, you were never to set foot in Miami again.
I know, I know, but the sunshine, the beaches, those little cuban pastries --come on.
I just couldn't let a blackmail threat keep me out of... paradise.
actually, at this point, blackmail ceases to be a threat.
at this point, I believe I ruin your life.
how about I give your boss a call?
I'll be honest, Michael. That file?
it -- it kept me up nights, so imagine my joy when your friend showed up on my radar investigating some highly suspicious accounts for my old pal Michael Westen.
Barry is the brick that I will tie around your neck before I throw you into that beautiful blue ocean over there.
now, how deep you sink depends on how quickly I get that blackmail file.
welcome to Miami.
so, pull the trigger.
there's enough in that file to reduce Bly's career to a smoldering crater.
he can link me to barry, and Barry's broken a law library's worth of financial regulations looking into this account number.
if Bly goes after me with that, I can throw the rest of my life into that crater, too.
government agents have to stay within the law, but they still have plenty of options to hit you below the belt.
sometimes, a bullet to the head is a lot easier than a slow death drowning in red tape.
sorry. For your own safety.
don't touch me -- for your own safety.
according to the board of health, this loft is unfit for human habitation.
and here I thought it was just a dump.
Fiona Glenanne, you're wearing more clothes than usual.
you know, I was on the fence about that chair.
thanks for making up my mind for me.
I hope that you're on the fence about everything that you own, because toxic mold could be anywhere.
there's been reports of spores spreading to places you wouldn't believe.
Nope. No mold in that one.
try the lamp. I was always iffy on it.
you know what? Thanks for watching out for me, Bly. I'm gonna grab some clothes.
call me when you're done.
Michael, don't worry. I packed you a bag with some clothes to wear.
um, I have to say, for a tough guy, you sure dress like an Easter egg.
I hope you're not bringing toxic mold into my house.
ma, there's no mold.
I'm glad you're out of there. The place didn't sound healthy.
my friend Paula is here.
she heard you were coming over, and she wanted to talk to you.
you advised her last week about the guy she met on the internet.
I am so sorry to bother you again.
this guy, Prescott -- I did what you said, ignored his e-mails.
then he called my house.
I think he's a stalker.
he's asking all these personal questions. It's...
like he's obsessed with me.
would it make you feel better if I talked to him?
Really? You could do that?
sure. Just let me put my bag away.
that's all right. I'll put it in the guest room.
michael will take care of everything.
he lives at the Delmar apartments.
I have his online dating profile.
I'm sure it'll be fine.
no prescott in this building. How about yours?
uh, not unless he's disguised as an 80-year-old retiree.
I mean, this little manhunt could take a while, Mike.
Oh, whatever. Better this than sitting in my mom's kitchen watching her smoke.
likes fixing up old cars. He's a mechanic, maybe?
I mean, I can check his A.S.E.Certifications, but, of course, that's if anything on this page is true.
check out the I. P.Address on his dating-service account, see what we're dealing with.
Ooh, speaking of love, I got to get going. I have a very big date.
she made millions as a beer distributor
the woman of my dreams.
you have many women in your dreams.
Oh, so, I'm a romantic, but this one, Mike
I mean, she's got a beach house in Antigua with a quad generator.
that's four kegs of beer at 33 degrees, baby.
sounds like love. Hello.
Michael, it's Paula.
Prescott's outside my work. - I'll be right there.
I saw his car drive past three times.
he walked by, looking in.
I'm the assistant manager. I can't have him in here making a scene.
this is a private bank.
we're an appointment-only private bank and safe-deposit company
very exclusive, very private.
I mean, you can understand why I can't have him...
has Prescott been asking you about your work, your schedule?
all of it.
I'm just afraid he's some kind of maniac.
who's that?
Oh, just an old friend.
did you get bored redecorating my place?
I'll redecorate your life if I have to.
you find that file?
not yet. Let's talk later.
actually, later is bad for me. Now is good.
I want every piece of paper you own that mentions me.
files, phone records, the page in your diary where you drew little heart around my name.
all of it.
you want to do this, Bly? You really want to go nuclear?
I'd love to.
you really think you have nothing to lose?
Michael, he's here --the stalker.
he's not a stalker.
this is a robbery.
stay quiet, follow our orders, or people die.
you'll find your cellphones are now useless.
we've blocked them, so leave them on the floor and head in to the conference room.
now!
go! Go! Go! Conference room!
there are a number of different choices when you take over a building by force.
get up! Move into the conference room.
do you keep the hostages face down on the floor, or do you move them into a room together?
let me see your hands.
move. Move.
how do you cut all the lines of communication out?
give me that cellphone!
get in that conference room.
and how do you deal with the place's security method?
whatever your style, hostile takeovers are about one thing -- total dominance.
silent alarm is dead.
now get into the conference room or you will be, too.
we got the bank manager.
if we both grab guns, we can level the playing field.
uh, the playing fieldis covered with hostages.
make a move now, and somebody could get shot.
if we don't make a move now, we may not get a chance later.
just wait, all right?
shut up. Move back with the others.
it's all right. Just stay calm. Stay calm.
it's gonna be all R... Bly.
that's quite enough of that.
welcome to my retirement party.
I want you all to have a good time, so let's down a few ground rules, shall we?
no attacking the hosts.
no leaving early.
no calling the police.
I see one cop, I kill three of you.
I see two cops, six people die.
you can do the math.
now, mess up my party by breaking one of my rules, and...
you can expect me to overreact.
a wounded hostage is a good measure of how far a criminal's willing to go.
they either want to keep the hostage alive...
get away from him.
I'm a doctor. If I don't stop the bleeding, he'll die.
then let him die.
or they don't, which means more people are getting hurt.
you have 20 hostages in an unstable psychological state.
if they think they're going to die, they will panic, and they will fight back.
I'm just trying to make sure that you get what you want and these people stay alive.
will you please allow me to attend to this man's wound?
knock yourself out. - Thank you.
let's go take a tour of the vault. Come on.
you son of a bitch.
I only need one person alive to get me the vault-access cards.
please don't make me choose.
told you someone would get shot.
Yeah, I overestimated you.
I figured you'd back me up.
you know, it's not a good idea to insult your doctor.
okay, this wound doesn't look good. I'm going to need to...
remove the round? - Yeah.
go ahead. Come here.
I need you to apply direct, steady pressure to this.
hold this up. Hold it up. - Okay. Okay.
in a hostage situation, any idiot can steal a gun and start shooting.
it's a great way to get a bunch of innocent people killed.
keeping people alive means fighting like a spy.
where is your data server?
it's by the elevator, but they cut the power to the computers, so...
I'm using it for something else.
we need to cut through this wall and get into the next room.
from there, we can get everyone out.
there's no way out from the next room. That's just an office.
there'll be a way out. I'm working on that part.
great. You don't think the guards outside will see us going through a wall?
I'll take care of the guards.
Yeah. No. Wait. You heard him.
if you attack his guys, he's gonna start shooting people.
I'm not going to attack them.
they're just gonna have some very bad luck.
where do you think you're going?
I need medical supplies. - Wait. Wait. Stop right there.
no one leaves the conference room.
your boss said stop the bleeding.
Yeah, he didn't say you could leave.
you want to go downstairs and ask him?
the man in there is going to die unless I remove the bullet from his arm.
to do that, I need tools, so help me find tweezers and propoxyphene or shoot me in the face --your call.
you've got two minutes. - We got less than that.
fighting like a spy means disguising attacks as attempts to help.
it means making acts of man seem like acts of god.
we have to go through here?
that's the plan.
does anybody have a razor or a letter opener?
here. I grabbed these.
good. Here.
we're really gonna trust your friend on this?
he is not my friend, but he might be able to get us out of here.
sir, watch the door.
start cutting at the outlet.
cutting through a wall with scissors isn't as hard as it sounds.
start at an electrical socket and saw through the hard surface of the drywall, and the lower layers are a lot easier.
gauze, aspirin --this kit is terrible.
we're gonna need to search desks and purses for some real pain meds.
no. You can do it with that.
with gauze? Right.
where did you get your medical degree?
wait for the water.
I'll look through these desks and meet you back at the conference room.
what? You got armed guard sat the only exit.
you think I'm gonna fight my way out with a stapler?
water's ready.
and look around for some towels.
in an enclosed space, getting around a cellphone jammer is a game of who's got the stronger signal.
a cellphone jammer broadcasts a powerful signal over a range of frequencies, but it can't compete with an entire ethernet wired to serve as one big antenna.
so, I said no more stress, no more work, and no more getting married.
life is too short. How many beach houses do I even need?
how many do you have? - Six.
seven? Oh, it doesn't matter. I'm always on vacation.
to me, true relaxation is a state of mind.
do you have to get that? - No. No.
you know, I like to relax, too.
Oh, you would love my place in Antigua -- hammock on the white sand beach.
clothes are optional.
excuse me.
this better be good, Mikey.
I'm at Broward private trust trapped in a bank heist.
it's Prescott. He's a pro.
his guys have killed the landlines and brought a cell jammer.
any cops, any resistance, and it gets bloody.
just tell me what you need, Mike.
I need you and Fi to blast a door to the outside.
Alleyside wall, 20 feet in from the north.
Alleyside wall, 20 feet in. You got it. I'm on my way.
is everything okay?
Oh, yeah. Well, uh, not really, no.
my buddy's being held hostage at a bank, and I got to bust him out.
it's true. - Well, we should call the police.
no. No. No. You can't do that.
uh, it's complicated, but there's nothing to worry about, and I'll call you later.
these are for the doc. Where is he?
go find him.
the massive air pressure that makes air hammers effective also makes them dangerous.
tamper in any way with the locking collar that holds the bit in place, and the air hammer becomes a very inaccurate gun with a single bullet.
not here. Keep looking.
mixing medications is always a bad idea, especially when one's an upper and one's a downer.
anxiety and allergy meds together are a scary combination, and that's before you add the caffeine of an energy drink.
Oh, there you are. What took you so long?
uh, I was just...
this is for the pain.
who said I was in pain?
if you're not now, you will be.
by the way, that green chair in my loft -- it was my favorite.
let's go, Fi.
you're just annoyed because Mike called me first and not you.
Sam, he's in the middle of a bank heist.
he's not thinking clearly.
Hey, I'm the one who should be annoyed.
I was having lunch with the woman of my dreams and had to leave.
but what are you gonna do, though?
you know, being Mike's first call is a big responsibility.
in case you're wondering, you'd be my 19th call.
I'd call Madeline before I called you.
experience with battlefield medicine may not make you as precise as an E. R.Surgeon...
Oh, come on.
but after you've stitched up a few people under artillery fire, you can handle outside pressure.
almost.
got it.
Oh, god.
we're making some progress on the wall, but they're checking on us.
we need maybe 20 minutes.
you've got to go faster. Keep working.
they're emptying the vault downstairs.
they're taking everything.
how long before they clear it all out?
I don't know. There's hundreds of safe-deposit boxes down there.
and he wasn't lying about the silent alarm.
no call went out.
no help is coming.
hide the hole.
Prescott wants you downstairs. Let's go.
Thanks.
michael said 20 feet in from the street?
are you sure? - Positive.
well, what's the signal? How are we timing this?
he didn't say.
he didn't say? - He's Mike. He's improvising.
michael called you to tell you to blow a hole in the wall of a bank, and you didn't think to ask when?
look, it was a brief conversation.
we didn't talk about shoes or movies either.
could you just place the explosives already?
fix him. - What happened?
the air hammer broke, and the piston came off in his leg.
keep him alive.
I'm gonna give you something for the pain, all right?
people are too trusting when it comes to pills.
they'll take whatever a doctor hands them.
I need to cauterize the wound.
I need to use your liquid nitrogen gun.
you need to use something else.
like what? Did you bring an electro surgical generator?
liquid nitrogen can cool a wound to 150 below, freezing the cells and cutting off blood flow.
tie this around his leg, tight.
either help me or get me someone who will.
up here?
super cooling also damages metal.
freeze the inside of a gun, and the next time it gets hot, it'll rip apart as if it's loaded with the wrong ammo.
Prescott, get up here.
we've got trouble in the conference room.
Where's the knife? - There's no knife. There isn't a knife.
this guy was trying to cut into the office next door.
come here.
what did I tell you about the rules, huh?
please, I --I have a wife. I have kids. They need their father.
I'm begging you.
look, if I make an exception, I mean, what kind of message does it send?
wait. Wait. You got the wrong guy.
it was me.
just can't stop causing trouble, can you, huh? Huh?
Shouldnt've done this the first time.
God!
shoot him!
move!
you got metal shards in your hand. You're gushing arterial blood.
I'm the only guy here who can save your hand, probably your life.
tell your man to back off or find another doctor.
come with me. Get the rest of them downstairs.
four more. Let's go.
Hey, we're running about 20 minutes late. Should I call the boat?
get downstairs.
I,I still need to get downstairs.
how's your escape plan going?
we're not getting out. I'm working on plan B.
I need your help. Do you trust me?
Yeah, what do you need?
I need you to coll apsein that door way. Sell it. Buy me time.
Oh, no.
what's going on?
I think he's going into shock. I can't move him. I'll need a couple of minutes.
you got one.
Mike, let's get this done. I got a beer-drinking angel to get back to.
you ready to rock?
forget the escape plan.
Prescott's moving everybody downstairs.
these guys are calling a getaway boat on walkies.
if you can listen in, locate the signaL.
maybe we can get some leverage.
I'll try to keep people from getting hurt in here.
come on. Downstairs. Let's go. Now.
all right.
elevators have so many safety devices that they're easy to sabotage.
disable any part, and the entire system shuts down.
hurry up. Move it!
locate the getaway boat. That's our plan.
this is Miami.
look, we just need to find the frequency that Prescott's walkies are on.
I still think we should set off the charges, blow a hole in the wall, rush in.
beats waiting out here. - Yeah, that's great.
let's get Mike and the hostages killed because you have the attention span of a 3-year-old.
elevator's busted.
you're lucky.
I don't see any shrapnel, and no bones look damaged.
use the word lucky again, I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.
hold still. I need to sterilize the wound.
this bank!
it's cursed.
that's it, isn't it?
it's cursed.
my gun, the air hammer, the elevator -- what's wrong with this place?
I'm gonna need more tape and a splint.
I think there's something I can use upstairs.
do you need any meds?
what do you think, huh?
let me blow your hand off and find out if you need something for the pain.
Angela, hey, it's Sam. How you doing?
is your friend okay?
uh, well, he's still trapped inside, but it's kind of a quiet time, so I thought I would just call and say hi. So...
I was thinking later, we could get some drinks.
I know this quiet spot that makes great a mojito.
well, I-I-I was meeting a friend, but
playtime's over.
uh, angela, I got to run. Hey, don't make any plans. I'll call you back.
sounds encrypted.
so I was wasting my time while you were buttering up your bimbo?
look, we got the frequency.
there can't be that many marinas around here in range of their walkies.
okay, that's not good.
those cops start asking questions out that truck out front, hostages are gonna die.
one of us needs to distract the cop, and the other one needs to track down the getaway boat.
and here I forgot to shave my legs.
delivery trucks.
Hey, stop! Give me that! - No!
she is stealingmy tip jar!
this is compensation for you leering at me.
you should arrest her.
you should arrest him for sexual harassment.
we're not arresting anyone.
you're just gonna stand there while I'm being objectified?
I say we go to the station, hash this out -- you, me, him. What do you say?
unit 204, this is dispatch. Got a domestic disturbance at ocean and 4th. You close?
I'm on my way.
if you'd like to file a report, you should go down to the police station, okay?
una cortadito, por favor.
we win yet?
I'm working on it. I need some meds. Things okay?
Yeah, hey, it's Miami.
the sun, the girls --what's not to love?
if something bad starts happening, make your move.
Yeah. These should do the trick.
life with a hypochondriac mother gives you a useful knowledge of pharmaceuticals.
those are for pain?
in low doses, pilocarpine cures dry mouth.
I'll take them after you do.
in high doses, it has roughly the same effect as a sarin gas attack.
satisfied?
see what happens to you first.
still want that splint for your hand?
sure.
Hey, we're going upstairs.
you, keep an eye on the hostages.
back in a minute.
Hey, what's it mean if my fingers are feeling numb and I'm getting sort of nauseous?
do you have a headache, any palpitations, any tingling, been drinking caffeine?
Yeah. Why? Is that bad?
sounds pretty serious. I should check you out.
I'm just gonna take your pulse. I'm just taking your pulse.
that's it. That's it. I'm just taking it.
in a weakened state, you want to avoid pressure on your carotid artery.
block the blood flow to your brain, and you black out in four seconds.
the coating on tablets and medicine keeps them from dissolving in your stomach right away, which buys you a little time to find some privacy and do the only safe thing.
get them out of your system.
Oh, hey, buddy.
Hey, I'm supposed to repair a radio in a guy's boat, but I'm late, and I forgot the slip number.
is there somebody hanging around his boat kind of looking pissed?
end of the pier.
Thanks. You have a good one.
vault's cleared out. It's about time.
let's put everyone in the vault and get the hell out of here.
everyone in the vault now.
they've seen our face. They die.
let's go. Everybody into the vault.
there isn't much air in the vault. We're all gonna suffocate.
should we attack them?
no, not yet.
I don't know how long we can wait.
just trust me.
Hey, Mike, I'm at the marina looking at the getaway boat.
Sam, we got any moves here?
Prescott's shoving everyone into the fault, and no one's walking out.
well, you want to ask Prescott if he'll trade his hostages for the boat driver?
not likely.
what about a little operation quick silver?
quick silver --you mean like world war II?
you're talking about a bunch of fake tanks and the whole normandy invasion force.
Yeah, but instead of the normandy invasion force, I have a walther with one bullet.
you got to sell this, Sam.
you got to sell it like you've never sold it before.
that's the kind of pep talk I like, Mikey.
I'm on it.
Sam, hi. I-I-I was calling to leave a message.
I think your life is -- is a little too fast-paced for me.
Oh, no. No. No. That's not true at all.
why are you whispering?
are you still outside the bank?
no. No, I'm at a marina.
just taking a stress-free walk along the ocean, the breeze blowing in my hair.
I might even get a tropical drink.
hands in the air.
a stress-free walk.
well, as much as I hate to admit it, Angela, you're probably right.
we're just not meant to be.
enjoy one of those beers in Antigua for me.
you bastard. You ruined something special.
if you have one bullet and you need to take down three armed guys in close quarters, you're betting your life on a lot of lucky breaks.
it's the kind of bet you don't want to make unless you have to.
there you are.
your guy had a stroke in the kitchen.
he needs immediate medical attention.
you want me to put him in the vault or just take care of him right here?
you're not listening to me.
either you get your friend into an ambulance with the proper meds, or he's not gonna make it.
well, I guess he's not gonna make it, and neither are you.
what's going on?
Prescott, they're at the boat.
they shot me. Why didn't you tell us?
why didn't I tell you what?
who we were robbing.
why didn't you tell us who owned the bank?
Oh, my god. You didn't know, did you? We're dead.
Oh, my god.
they're coming back.
they're coming back.
we're all dead! We're all dead!
was it dumb luck that you chose my bank, or did you and your buddies decide that today was a good day to make the worst mistake of your lives?
who is this?
that's not important --what's important is that you and your friends are robbing my bank, and no one
I mean no one --does that to me.
so, you think you got yourself a good plan with your getaway truck and your boat?
well, I got a plan, too.
if there is a scratch on anyone in my bank, you will all die.
if there is a single dollar missing from my vault, you all die.
you hearing this?
if there is a single hostage taken, you will all die.
in fact, if you do anything other than walking out of my bank alone right now, you will all know such pain as you have never imagined.
so, who the hellis that guy?
he owns this bank?
he's lying.
I looked up everything about this bank.
well, you obviously didn't look up enough.
what did you get us into?
how does he even know we're here?
shut up.
it's not important!
one evening, a patient was brought into my clinic in the middle of the night.
he was tortured so badly I couldn't believe he was still breathing.
a man was with him.
it was the man on your radio.
I'll never forget the voice.
he put a gun to my head and explained to me that my patient had robbed him and that he wanted me to save him so the pain would last longer.
I did what I could.
he said to come here for my money -- my blood money.
there's a place between life and death.
amazing how long a man can linger there.
that's enough, all right? Okay.
bring everything upstairs.
we're getting out of here.
Tony? Tony, can you hear me?
what the hell is going on?
I know this guy.
he'll have people outside the bank, in your truck, and on your boat.
you have no idea who you're dealing with.
shut your mouth. We've got the money.
that's just some voice on the radio.
Yeah, but he's a voice on our radio.
he's on our boat!
how does that happen?
what happened to the guys in the vault, huh?
he's -- he's talking about our truck!
there's nothing wrong with our truck!
let's just get out of here!
nothing's wrong with the truck?
does that look like nothing?
pick up the bag.
no way. I am gonna...
unbelievable.
just not your day, I guess.
drop it! Drop it! Hands on your head!
so, where were we?
I think we were deciding whether we were going to destroy each other.
well, you've already had enough opportunities to let me die.
maybe I just like the challenge.
I'm gonna go pass out at the local E. R.
and when I wake up, I'll take care of the loft and the thing with Barry.
as long as you're in a helpful mood, you think I could add one more favor to the list?
then they moved us into the vault.
we knew there wasn't much time.
I mean, I really thought it was the end, but your son and Mr. Bly were so brave, Madeline.
Michael, what are you doing?
I left something in here.
you just assumed I was never gonna broil anything?
well, so far I've been right.
Prescott will be leaving you alone from now on.
you might want to select your dates a little more carefully in the future.
I will. Thank you so much.
Bye, honey. - Bye.
I'm off, too.
what? You -- you're going?
you -- you didn't even spend the night.
I resolved my toxic-mold issue.
board of health says my place is safe again.
Oh, okay.
I was thinking of ordering takeout, but if you're going...
actually, I don't have to leave right away.
takeout sounds good.
Bly says you're off the hook.
he was just using you to get under my skin anyway.
listen, Michael, I feel really bad about the whole tacky business with the wire.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I love how I look with a shaved chest, but rolling over on you...
I ask you to take risks. It comes with the territory.
but next time, we'll have a signal.
if you're wired, tip me off by offering to pay for lunch.
perfect. You know, I think I'm gonna get out of town for a bit.
I got to decompress. - Sounds good. Stay safe.
all right, man.
Hey, I had to take the guy on the boat down, get him to say the right thing sat the right time.
while you were putting on a show, I got rid of the cops, and I wired a truck to blow.
Mike, back me up.
I mean, I think it's pretty clear my tactical maneuverings pretty much saved the day here.
you feeling underappreciated?
Oh, no. He appreciates himself plenty.
he's been insufferable ever since you called him first yesterday.
Fi, look, don't be insulted.
you're good with the hands-on stuff -- the simple mechanical things.
simple? Like wiring a truck to blow?
an important task, yes, but one a very intelligent monkey could perform.
I'm just saying there's a reason why I'm number one on the speed dial.
Sam, for your information, I called Fi first.
you didn't pick up, so in the future, I'm gonna call Sam first.
it's all the originals --everything I had on you.
I love your attention to detail, Michael.
this would have been quite the career-ender.
well, I know a little something about that...
although I wasn't expecting you to counter with even better leverage well-played.
this would be a good Michael Westen story if people were allowed to tell Michael Westen stories.
so... - so.
any luck trucking down that Cayman islands account?
look, I don't have to tell you, we have ways of investigating that most people don't know about.
no one has the reach that we do, but this...
I found the bank and I even found the banker, but the account
it's just a number.
no name? No organization?
nothing. It gets worse.
that account was being monitored -- an electronic trip wire of sorts.
and you think you tripped it?
might have been me. It might have been Barry.
look, whoever you're looking for, they know you're coming.
good luck.
my name is michael westen. I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, michael.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
give us the man who killed our operatives, and you and I can have a little chat about your future.
you didn't tell her it was victor, did you?
the man has tried to kill you twice.
he's the one enemy I know carla has.
I'd like to at least talk to him before I turn him in.
you tell carla someone else went after her operatives, and we're friends.
I have questions, and I have a feeling you can answer them.
well, that's not on the menu.
I'm asking for answers.
the most dangerous time in any operation is just as everything's coming together.
you never know whether you're about to get a pat on the back or a bullet to the back of the head.
of course, there's not much you can do but act like everything's fine.
Hello, michael.
care for a chocolate-covered pomegranate seed?
Khava tea?
you drove all the way out here to offer me a snack? I'm touched.
it's a taste of your former life.
good old days before the burn notice, when michael westen was just a carefree spy in the deserts of afghanistan.
you know, I was like you once, michael. Lived for the job.
eventually, I discovered the job doesn't love you back.
you got burned? - Yes.
I was angry at first.
then I found I didn't miss it.
you might find the same thing, michael.
and if I want my life back?
well... that's why I'm here.
anything's possible if you do your job.
I'm working on it. You know me.
this is serious, michael. Management's not happy.
they'll be in town shortly to make sure everything's resolved.
these are not people to be trifled with, michael, believe me.
I'll do my best, then.
remember, there are worse things than being blacklisted.
Oh, I know. I could be this guy.
Hey, mikey. You sure you weren't followed?
sure as I can be.
unless she's got an invisible helicopter, I think we're fine.
Yeah, I wouldn't put it past her.
she needs to back off if I'm gonna solve her problem.
from what I can tell, she really needs me to solve the problem.
let's see how our guest is doing.
last I checked, he was sleeping.
it's kind of tough to sleep when you're cable-tied to a chair.
how long's he been in there alone?
a few hours. You said not to open the door.
what's in that?
Oh, beanbag rounds.
at this range, it'll break a few ribs.
nice place.
I stayed in a bed and breakfast like this once.
glad you like it.
when you're dealing with a trained operative, you have to assume they're as good as you are.
if you'd have cut through your restraints given a few hours alone, chances are he had the same idea.
that's enough rough-housing, boys.
it's always fun until someone gets hurt.
so, now we're cozy. What shall we talk about?
why don't we start with why you tried to blow me up?
you make it sound so personal.
I was removing operatives from the field. You were cogs in a machine.
I just hit that machine with a baseball bat.
why'd you hit the machine, then?
you know, not to be rude, but I'd just as soon skip to the end here.
the end?
well, if there's one thing everyone knows about michael westen, it's that he wants his job back.
and here I sit, your shot at getting that.
now, it doesn't take an intelligence analyst to see how this ends.
so, wake me when carla gets here, or shoot me now and save everyone some time.
you went after carla's organization. Why?
why does it matter?
nothing I say will change the fact that I'm your ticket out.
why is your curiosity more important than my nap?
you're out of moves here, victor.
your only shot here is to trust me.
hmm, trust you. Just like that.
you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
I was cia.
my family was stationed with me in mexico city. An op went bad, and...
I lost my wife and son.
the burn notice went out the same day.
I was out on my ass, my family was dead, not even enough money for a bus ticket home.
and then you got a call from carla.
well, I was more enthusiastic about the opportunity than you were.
it was a way back in, a way to get payback.
well, it took me some time, but I found what I was looking for.
and the punch line, the really, really funny part is, it was carla.
she had my family killed as part of my recruitment.
I'm sorry.
by that time, I was inside.
I was an effective operative.
and I figured,"hey, while I'm here, why not gut the entire organization?
well, I took my shot.
and here we are.
Carla doesn't know you're here.
if you're telling the truth, maybe we can work on this together.
I've got a boat docked out at the end of randall key.
the cabin is booby-trapped with a claymore.
check under the bed.
if you want proof, that's the best I can do.
you're trusting him?
how many times does someone have to try to kill you before he's crossed the line?
we came to an understanding.
you know, when I was a kid, I adopted a dog that I found.
he had these big eyes, and I used to rub his belly, and I thought we had something special
right up until he bit a chunk out of me.
I'll show you the scar if you'd like.
I'll be careful, sam. - I'm coming with you.
give him some air. See what else you can get out of him.
rub his belly if you need to.
nice work.
Victor should probably teacha class or something.
clear.
he said to checkunder the bed.
spam and cap'n crunch.
no wonder he's so erratic.
spies are supposed toravel light with nothing that could identify them.
some do, but most find that staying sane requires staying connected to something that reminds them why they do what they do.
pictures are particularly dangerous to carry, unless the people in them are already dead.
Michael, his little boywas only 4.
who knew you couldfeel this bad for a psychopathon the edge of sanity?
people don't get thereon their own, fi.
being under carla's thumb, it's a strain.
well, you've doneall right.
I never lost everyoneI cared about.
you and I need to havea little chat, 'cause you've gota long way to go before I believeall this business.
is this an interrogation?
no. That's suchan ugly word.
I just want you to show me that you arewho you say you are.
establish your identity.
that's, what, number five in the militaryinterrogation manual?
look, we don't have to playany games here.
the fact is, we're bothon the same side, right?
fear down. "Approach 14, right?
Yeah. I believeit is number 14. So how about this?
technique number one --the direct approach.
my best friend, mike, is out there putting his butt on the line for you, soI want some answers.
now, the folksthat you work for
is this a government agency, a foreign power?
what are we up against?
well, they never gave me a peekat the employee handbook.
all I knowis they run black ops.
could be multinational. Could be work for hire.
they break jobs into piecesso no one gets the big picture.
well, that's not a good sign. Why miami?
they're in cities all over.
although fromwhat I can tell, they may have to shut downin miami for a while.
well, I don't likethe sound of that. - You shouldn'T.
if michael doesn't hand me over, carla's gonna cut her losses, starting withmichael's family.
she's gonna bea busy girl.
what's wrong?
well, I've been talkingto our unstable friend.
this doesn'tsound good, mike.
I mean, the big boysare coming into town, and if we don'thand him over...
no, we're not handinganyone over.
I'm just saying, we could have a waron our hands.
let me cancelmy meeting. - No, don'T.
we need to keepeverything looking likebusiness as usual.
Sam, can you pick up my mom? Take her up to orlando.
make it look like a day trip.
I don't want her in townif anything starts happening.
I'm on it.
you sure you don'twant me to -- - no, fi, go. I'll be all right.
stretch those arms out. Get up. That's it. Stretch way out, way out. More.
what a great exercise it is for your shoulders and your arms, to help you when you wear those sleeveless dresses, you gals, to really help you look like you should look.
and you guys out there, I want you to look like a man's supposed to look.
Sam! You scared me.
sorry. Listen, madeline, I hate to do this to you again, but, uh, we gota situation.
why, what's wrong? Is michael okay?
he's fine. But is your stuff handy?
cause it's time for anemergency trip to disney world.
disney world?
why in god's name would I wantto go to disney world?
because it'sa magical kingdom with lots of witnessesand great security.
so if you could just getyour bag, we'll go.
no. I'm not runningfor michael anymore!
and I think it's time that all of you stoppedtreating me like a baby and told mewhat's going on.
uh, that's a long story.
wonderful. I love stories.
Yeah, but, see, it's the kind of story that's best toldon the way up to orlando.
do you know they have a hotelup there where the giraffes, they come right upto your balcony?
well, as muchas I love giraffes...
I'm not uprooting my life againto run from something
I don't even knowwhat it's about, sam!
so I'm not goinganywhere...
till I get some answers.
uh, oof, well, it's -- it's complicated.
uh, oof, well, the sooner you explain, the sooner we'll be offto cinderella's castle.
Victor, I sympathizewith your situation.
but it's a little hardto trust someone when they've triedto kill you four times.
four? That seems high.
Oh, come on, you're countingearlier with the chair. - Yes.
listen, sport, relax.
this will all be over shortlyfor you and for me.
well, you told carla to back offso you could find me, yes?
of course you did.
they'll still run surveillance, though, and check in. What time is it -- 10: 30 or so?
about that.
I've been off the grid long enough for themto get suspicious.
they'll have gottenthe go-ahead to hunt you, set up a perimeter aroundyour last known location.
if there's a major roadaround here
they'll be waiting at it. Wonderful!
look at it this way --when carla finds out you hid me, all your questionswill be resolved...
with a bullet to the headfor both of us.
Oh, you're gonnakill me yourself.
well, hell, yeah, if you'regonna step to the bell, you might as wellring it, huh?
let's get out of here.
wait, wait, you're gonna help me?
lucky you.
Oh, looks like they were closerthan I thought.
probably just waitingto see our pretty faces before they moved in.
you drive.
you don't last long as a spy if you don't trust anyone.
if you're looking over your shoulder to see who's coming after you, you can't see where you're going.
sometimes you just have to trust your gut.
these guys are pretty good.
looks like they pulled out all the stops for us.
I'm flattered.
in a firefight on the road, you've got a few options.
without something high-caliber, you're not going to be able to penetrate the radiator or the firewall behind it.
that leaves two options
the windshield or ricocheting bullets off the ground up through the undercarriage, which is one of the least-reinforced parts of the car.
for sheer panic, it's hard to beat bullets coming up from the floorboards.
is that brake fluid?
polyethylene glycol's not gonna burn fastenough to do anything.
it will when it's mixedwith chlorine dioxide and some other stuff.
someone's been tothe chemical store, I see.
I like you. Have I ever told you that?
here comes another one. We got to get out of here.
we're gonna need to finda parking garage.
we need a new ride.
Carla, not a good time!
you think you're clever. - Clever?
well, I tested wellin school, but they saythat doesn't mean
you're trying to save the manwho tried to kill you.
Victor and I have knowneach other for a long time.
you have no ideawho you're dealing with.
you know, I knowit's been a short time, but sometimes you meet someone, and you just get that feeling.
enough. It's time you learnedactions have consequences.
she give you the "actions have consequences" speech?
Yeah.
as someonewho's doled out a lot of those consequencesover the years, she'll go afteryour family.
that'll be harderthan she thinks.
here. There.
how about this? Two guys, miami, cute convertible. Perfect camouflage.
Yeah, I'm looking for something with a littlemore horsepower.
here comes a second car. This should get interesting.
Madeline, if I knew more, I would tell you.
so you don't knowwho these people are? I mean, you have names.
can't you just look them up?
that's not how it works.
if somebody's doing somethingoff the books, they don't hand outdecoder rings and builda mountain fortress.
so it's carla and victor.
and michael's in troublewith them.
so what does ithave to do with me?
it's all a wayto get to mike. You're somebodyhe cares about. It's leverage.
please, I'm not leverage. You want a beer?
no, madeline! I don't want a beer.
okay. This is serious.
that's whatI'm trying to say.
I'll get my stuff.
crap.
change of plans. Where's your shotgun?
in the back. - Go get it, now.
what the hellare you doing? - Get down.
I guess this means we're notgoing to disney world.
they're not taking any chances with thetwo bad boys in here.
they're doing it right, setting up a perimeterand waiting for backup.
well, we should getsome backup of our own.
careful with that phone. Chances are, it's a party line now.
pleasure doing businesswith you. Say hi to paco.
Bonjour. - Fi.
Michael, you are not gonnabelieve the deal I got today.
I am better at buying gunsthan I am at buying shoes, and I am really goodat buying shoes.
Fiona glenanne. - What?
remember that drive pastthe factory where we first met?
do you think we could dosomething similar where we, uh, picnickedlast month?
you'll be makingthis drive soon?
as fast as I can manage.
they're setting upa spike strip.
Oh, this is gettingbetter and better.
I'm not getting michaelor fiona.
they probably ditchedthe phones.
should I call the police? - No.
that'll make it waytoo easy for them.
cops take us to the station, they know where we are, and they knowthat we are unarmed.
so what do we do? Just sit here and wait?
no, they're gonnaget more guys.
we got to create a distractionand get them out of here.
but the thing is, they're all over my car, and there's no way to getyour car out of the garage.
we could borrowmrs. Reynolds' car.
she lives overthe back fence, and i have the keyin case of emergency.
back fence, huh? That could work.
Madeline, think you could findsome christmas lights?
when you're outmanned and outgunned, the key is to appear bigger and stronger than you are.
take your enemy's expectations and turn them against him.
to make a good-sized fireball without a lot of ordnance, you need a powder with a high surface-area-to-mass ratio.
non-dairy creamer mixed with gunpowder works nicely.
I could probably put twoor three of them down, get one of their gunson the way out.
we're trying to keepthe body count a little bit lowerthan that.
this isn't just about gettingout of a parking garage. We might have a shotright now.
I've worked with carlafor a long time now.
insurance? - Yeah, she likes her ops teamsfor personal errands.
making extra cash, payback, that kind of thing.
now, I've got a fileat a safe house in town. Now, we get that...
we can blackmail our wayto safety.
Yeah, it'sa distant second to dousing her in keroseneand lighting a match, but under the circumstances, it'll have to do.
now, are we ready to use thisor what?
I think we can get furtherwith this. Let's go.
a security perimeter is like a defensive line in football.
you've got a couple of options.
you can try to punch through the line with brute force...
or you can soften it up with a little misdirection.
here they come.
look out.
get out of the way!
I'm liking your planless and less.
everything's fine, as longas we keep them behind us.
fine? - Relatively fine.
come on, michael.
where did you meet her?
blackmail. That's the idea?
we're doing all this so we can throw somepaperwork at carla?
it's the smart play here. We're outgunned.
we'll get bigger guns.
I can't believewhat I'm hearing.
I saw what she did to youand your family.
if the file is so great, then why didn't youuse it before?
this isn't just about her.
I want the guyswho call the shots.
the file was just in case, enough to force her to back off.
if this was just about puttinga bullet in carla, it would have been overa long time ago.
still, putting a bullet in carlasounds awfully good.
if it comes to that, you'll have to get in line.
Yeah, about that file?
your safe house --not so safe.
she's good. I was three deepwith fake safe houses trying to keep this placefrom her.
sometimes I wishshe'd get a hobby.
which room is it in?
it's not in a room. It's on the utility pole.
a fake utility box isn't a bad hiding place.
Oh, nice.
people don't touch things labeled "high voltage.
repair crews leave them alone, too.
they're not real, so they never need servicing.
too bad carla'ssurveillance is parked rightin front of it.
two cars, four guys. Think we can handle it.
we each shoot oneand rochambeau for the other.
Yeah, we don't knowit's carla's guys.
it could be atf, fbiworking off of bad intel.
they could becompletely innocent.
Oh, please. No one's completely innocent.
is that what you told yourselfwhen you tried to kill me?
let's go.
thanks for calling onstar.
Yes, I need directionsto the closest hardware store.
I'd like to avoidmajor intersections and government buildings.
I found a hardware store on siebert avenue. Would you like me to direct you?
Yes, please.
okay. The party's starting.
you ready? - Does it matter?
not really.
do you think they saw us?
no, they're busywith the team out front. We're probably good to go.
if I knewthat baby was here, I would have gotten usout of there a lot faster.
turn this way? - Right down here.
Why? Is it a shortcutwhere we're going?
I'm telling you, I think the idea sucks. Just pull over in here.
what, where? Right here? - Now. Yes.
why are we pulling over here? - Don't ask questions. Just do it, please.
Madeline, you saw what happenedback there, right?
Yeah, I did.
you really think the best useof your time is a three-hour driveto orlando?
Yeah. Do you have a better idea? - Yeah, I do.
okay, fine. Well, let's hear your plan.
I take care of myself, and you go save my son!
they sent men to mewith guns, sam.
God knows whatthey sent to him.
listen, the one thing a woman my age can doin miami is blend in.
if they can pick me out of10, 000 other 60-something women with bleached-blond hair,
I guess I'm done for, huh?
can you find him?
maybe. We got a few rally pointsaround miami we use for emergencies.
but come on, madeline. Are you sure?
he needs youmore than I do, sam. Just go, please.
Bye, sam.
Mike's gonna kill me.
one of the most common cover I. D. S for a spy is service personnel.
of course, anyone who works in intelligence knows to check service personnel.
so a quick phone call to the gas company, and you've created the perfect distraction.
the active ingredient in pepper spray is the chemical capsaicin.
mix the birdseed with some alcohol and oil, pressurize it in a paint sprayer with co2, and you have a homemade pepper grenade.
a few nails in the right places on a car door blocks the lever bar, making it impossible to open, and leaving you free to do pretty much whatever you want.
I could see why carlawouldn't want this out there.
she'd send a black-ops teamto deal with a parking ticket.
pretty much.
the higher-ups stay awayfrom most operations.
they have two rules -- don'tscrew up, and don't get caught.
they don't get involved unlessthings go very, very wrong.
well, I'd saythis situation qualifies.
Carla has a lot of enemiesfrom her spook days, and she's made more since.
and then she made the mistakeof vouching for you, big guy.
those files should bemore than enough to earn hera retirement bullet.
Carla's entire work history --this is pretty damning stuff.
you think you can playthis card?
when we get backto my boat, I've got the codes andcomm lines to go above her head.
if she knows I can getto them with this, then she'llback off -- fast.
then we get out of town, maybe to cuba.
fabulous. Great music, lots of sexy unemployed men.
Fi, can I talk to youfor a sec?
I'm not invited to cuba.
they're gonna follow uswith everything they have.
I need you to find samand help him protect my family.
can't sam do iton his own?
I know you don't liketo hear this, but you and samare a good team.
and do you think I... - the car.
I expect you to bring it backclean with a full tank. Capisce?
I can do that.
it's not goodbye. It's just... in case.
and that is to remind youto be careful.
looks like no one's around.
we'll scout the perimeter. If it's clear, we'll go in.
all this time, you neverfound out who burned you?
who cares? Name in a file.
behind that, another name.
you know howthese things start. Someone runs an operationoff the books.
it's supposed to bea one-time thing, but when it's over, there's power to be had.
takes on a life of its own.
it's the organization, not some guy.
why me?
don't tell me my namewas picked out of some hat.
it was no secretyou were good at your job.
the machine wanted you, so it took you.
now you're part of it. And I'm part of it.
but that's what we're tryingto destroy here, sport.
Ah, there you are.
I haven't been able to getanybody on the phone for ages.
Where's mikey? Is he here?
no. He decided to go on a tripto cuba with victor.
they're going after carlawith documents.
what are wesupposed to do?
I promised him I'd help youprotect the family.
well, I promised madelineI'd help protect mike.
so I guessthe question is...
which promise do we keep?
looks like we're all clear.
we have enough fuelto make it to the island, as long as we don't have to dotoo much detouring on the way.
you start the engines. I'll cast off.
bad day fora cruise, michael.
a very, very bad day.
you think so?
and here I was hopingyou came to see us off.
I took the precaution of havingthe local marinas searched when I lost contactwith victor.
seemed like a long shot.
hated to thinkmy two favorite operatives might be making nastylittle plans together.
sorry to disappoint you.
well, not to spoil the fun, but the boat's wired with c-4.
can't have you leavingbefore we have a chat.
great. Come on board. Let's talk.
I'm fine here, thanks.
Michael, management's on the way.
they're gonna want to knowwhat happened here.
any story I tell themhas to begin with victor's dead body.
afraid of what he might shareabout your history together?
not important. What's important is thatthis story needs a hero.
it could be you.
kill him or send him out, and I'll do it.
if you leave me no alternative, there's always the c-4.
you want to explain blowing upyour entire team?
doesn't speak wellfor your management skills.
Yeah, well, I'd haveto explain two dead bodies. You'd have to beone of them.
just end this, michael! He's a killer. You know that.
he's what you made him. - Time is up, michael!
finish it off, or I will finish it for you!
finally.
look, I know you wantto savor the moment, but we got to getout of here.
looks like whoever's in thatchopper brought some backup.
standing by for clearance. Secure your perimeter.
move it.
they're heading into the trees.
clear for touchdown.
we got to talk, big guy.
you have to get out there and get on top of thisbefore her body cools.
take the file. Tell them when you found me, I turned on carla.
you lured her here, had your team take her out, and then killed me.
killed you?
it's over.
the only question is...
whether you're a traitorwho helped me or the ace operativewho shot me.
help me out.
I'm dead one wayor the other.
they get me alive, and they're gonna take me apart.
you know it hasto be like this.
it was good playingwith you, sport.
now you get out.
get out while you can.
Hey, there! Took you guys long enough.
put down the gun.
want to get thoseout of my face?
could have usedyou guys earlier.
no, this is for the big guy.
good luck, mike.
in intelligence work, your most important tool
more important than any combat technique, any technical skill
is your ability to twist the facts of a situation to your own advantage.
the worse the facts are, the more you've got to sell it.
well...
two rogue operativesin one day? Lucky us.
you're welcome. You know, I think you needto talk to the folks in human resources.
you have some staff issues.
I agree completely.
tell me, michael, since you knowso much about our problems, what should I do about ournew recruit, michael westen?
wonderfully effective, terrifically resourceful, truly the best I've ever seen, but he just doesn't seem happy.
maybe it's the threatsagainst his family.
maybe it's the peopletrying to kill him.
maybe it's the factthat he had to use his people to clean up your mess.
your operatives -- - are dead. And you're not.
you've createda job opening, michael.
and I have to fill it.
want money? We can do that.
you want to get outof miami?
I want you peopleout of my life!
out of your life?
tell me, michael. All your old enemiesfrom your spy days, all the people who have scoresto settle with michael westen
where do you thinkthey've been?
did they justforget about you?
or has someone beenkeeping them at bay?
you think you've beenunder our thumb?
you've beenunder our protection. Think about that.
Yeah, I'll be fine, thanks.
you really think so? - Yeah.
tell you what.
we'll leave you aloneif that's what you want. Your family, too.
see how you like it.
you want out?
there's the door.
but hear this
you have no ideawhat hell will rain down if we stop watching outfor you.
I'll take my chances.
as a spy working for a government, you're protected.
you may work solo, but you have agreements with other spy agencies.
even when you're surrounded by your enemies, that protects you.
when your entire career consists of making enemies, there's no greater danger than being totally cut off, alone.
when you find yourself out in the cold, all you can do is put your head down and try to survive.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing...no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI
you know spies...a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line...as long as you're burned,
mysterious trips around the world with Max.
I mean, he's, what, your keeper or whatever?
he's my agency contact.
the right people are starting to take notice.
michael Westen, soon-to-be reinstated agent of the CIA.
how does that sound?
that sounds great, Max. Thanks for everything.
stay with me， stay with me. Max. Max.
Fi, someone shot Max, the police are on the way, and I think I'm holding the murder weapon.
I covered my tracks so I covered the tracks of the killer.
Michael, we have to do something about that gun.
and we need to get an alibi for you, like, right now.
let's go to work.
as a spy, you're in the information business...stealing it, protecting it, and, if you have to, destroying it.
some secrets are so dangerous that you can't allow them to continue to exist.
a murder weapon that implicates you in a crime you didn't commit, for example, is a secret best kept with 4, 000 degrees of burning thermite.
Hey. Got here as soon as I could.
how'd it go? - Okay.
I put together some credit-card receipts putting everyone in Key West yesterday on a little vacation.
key West? - Hey.
you want an alibi on such short notice, you don't get to be picky.
you guys are melting down a gun.
I don't have much choice.
whoever did this knew exactly what they were doing.
they managed to put a murder weapon in Michael's hands and get away clean.
I just want to put this out there.
if we go to the cops now - No.
it's not gonna fly. I talked to the cops.
the CIA has taken over the scene.
they got a case officer down here now.
and she wanted me in for a chat.
Oh. Great. Perfect.
and you have no idea who killed Max? - None.
could be an enemy of Max's who wants a burned spy for a fall guy or an enemy of mine looking to keep me out of the game.
what about the people who burned you?
you said you had doubts about that investigation.
anything's possible, but I'm not gonna be able to find out if I'm in jail for first-degree murder.
we have to get rid of the gun. - Are you sure about this?
once you start a cover-up, there's no going back.
it's already started.
I trashed the key logs at the murder scene and wiped the place down.
the only thing that's gonna save me is finding the real killer.
this train's rolling, brother.
the only question is whether you get on board.
hell yeah. I'm on board. Yeah.
you must be Michael Westen.
I'm Agent Pearce. Thanks for coming.
no place I'd rather be.
Max was... - A friend? I know.
I'd, uh, offer my condolences, but I'm much better at catching bad guys than shedding tears.
we'll find whoever did this.
what can I do?
let me walk you through the scene.
you be the killer.
we found two bullets out in the hallway, so if you are the killer, you fire on Max out there, miss, then chase him in here.
blood spatter says Max was... where I'm standing.
you bust in, put two shots in his back.
he bleeds out here.
now Max is dead.
what do you do? - Run to the exit.
I think you head for the key log.
so, you rip the hard drive out of the wall.
now there's no record of your entry.
but how do you get out clean?
elevator.
no trace. Try again.
I hope you're not asking me to jump.
Oh, you're the killer in this little exercise.
is that how you escaped? - Not unless I could fly.
we found rope fibers, and I got friction marks right here.
the killer rappelled down.
probably had help. How are your climbing skills?
not bad. Why?
am I a suspect?
to be honest, when I heard a burned spy was mixed up with Max, my first instinct was to fit you for a head bag.
I appreciate your restraint.
well, you did show up today.
and as your new agency contact, a head bag wouldn't have started us off on the right foot.
you're Max's replacement?
we worked on some operations together.
I have some investigations experience.
I asked for this assignment.
Max was one of the good guys.
I want to find out who did this just as much as you do.
I'd love to have you on the team.
you should know this about me, though...
I've got a pit bull at home, and I learned how to run an investigation from her.
she sinks her teeth in, she doesn't let go.
ever.
she sounds like a nice dog.
she can be.
but she is a very, very determined bitch when she wants something.
I need to know I can count on you.
I'm your man.
I was hoping you'd say that, Michael.
I don't get it.
you're joining the CIA manhunt?
did you forget that search could end up at your doorstep, Michael?
if I'm one of the hunters, maybe I can avoid that.
Plus, looking over Pearce's shoulder gives me a bird's-eye view of the entire investigation.
we should be working our own angle to find out who killed Max.
Pearce is already checking the cellphone activity from the day of Max's murder.
why can't I just cheat off her notes?
you think the killer made a call? - Maybe.
I've never seen the police respond that fast.
at least I can make sure that they don't track the phone call I made to you.
so, check the phone records.
but if Pearce starts poking around, don't forget there are no conjugal visits in CIA jail.
is that who you're supposed to be meeting here?
Yeah. - Bad time for a client.
who is he?
he was with the Special Forces in Afghanistan.
my C. O.tracked me down, asked for a favor.
and you're...
not telling the captain who pulled me out of a burning jeep that "I don't really have the time right now.
Michael. Lieutenant Ethan Reed.
Mrs. Westen.
why don't you grab a seat, Lieutenant?
so, what can I do for you?
captain Novak didn't tell me, really, what this was about other than we have a lot in common.
well, the CIA recruiters on base were hounding me pretty bad until I made it clear I wasn't interested.
or maybe it's that I beat your sharpshooting record at Camp Rhino...
94% from 600 meters.
so, you're here to pick up the trophy?
no, no. I,um...
is there somewhere we can talk that's more private?
let's take a walk.
so, I got back from my tour in Afghanistan a couple of months ago, and I found out that my sister was dating this guy, Brandon, a-and I knew he was a scumbag, but he seemed harmless.
what happened?
he, uh, he nearly beat her to death.
he put her in intensive care.
I'm sorry, Ethan. Have the cops done anything?
they'd arrest him if he fell in their lap, but they're not looking for him very hard.
I thought you could help me track him down using some of your resources.
right up my alley. - Fi.
you end up finding Brandon. What next?
after what he did to Heather...
I think Ethan's already picked flowers for Brandon's funeral.
you're not thinking this through.
she's your sister.
it won't take long for the cops to figure out you're the number-one suspect.
so, that's it? You're saying you're not gonna help?
no. If you want my help, Brandon goes to jail, not to the morgue.
fine. But I'm coming along every step of the way.
when we catch him, I want to be there.
at the very least, I owe this guy a broken nose.
I can live with that. - Go to your meeting.
I'll call Sam and see if we can lure Brandon out of hiding.
Mrs. Depaolo?
we don't mean to bother you, but is your son, Brandon, here?
sorry. He moved out years ago.
Oh, uh, could you tell us where to find him?
because Brandon's got himself a brand-new laptop, hell, maybe even an iPad, if this check ever finds him.
I don't know where he is.
and why is he getting a check?
it's a legal matter.
your son had some auto-body work done at a shop in Brickell a couple years back.
well, the owner of the shop just lost a class-action lawsuit.
he was overcharging his customers.
Brandon was a customer, so Brandon gets a check.
I mean, two g's may not seem like much, but... - $2, 000?
I know it's an inconvenience, but maybe you could take the check and hand it off to Brandon next time you see him?
I...I could do that.
great. Thank you very much.
so, she took the check. Now what?
well, now Cathy takes the money to Brandon, or he shows up here.
almost always works, but it's not fast.
why don't you go home? We'll take the first shift.
no. No, I'm on every shift.
lucky us.
whether you're operating out of a war room in Langley or commandeering a hotel in South Beach, all CIA investigations work the same.
because analysts are tied directly into federal and local databases, they have information at their fingertips.
what they don't have is a magic button that tells them what is a real lead and what is a dead end.
that takes boots on the ground, eyeballs on the screens, and lots and lots of coffee.
what, the CIA can't afford filing cabinets?
I don't think I'll be getting much sleep until we find Max's killer.
so, where are we? What are we doing?
we'd like to revisit your final operation with Max.
I read the file...some sort of corporate espionage the French were involved with?
dead end. Got out clean.
the operation before that, then.
I'm telling you, that's not where you want to look.
we were doing small-scale field operations, nothing that would get anyone killed.
if you are trashing my leads, you would better have something to suggest.
how about cellphone activity around Max's office?
the FBI's gonna run them down.
FBI? That's three weeks of red tape.
are you sure that's a good idea?
these investigations take time, Michael. You know that.
someone who's not "official" could work a lot faster than the FBI.
if that were the case, I wouldn't want to know details, because if that person got caught digging...
they'd be on their own.
it was nice not seeing you today.
what's with the "Yellow Pages"?
just a little pleasure reading.
this is not taking forever.
Brandon's not gonna show.
he'll show. Just be patient.
in Afghanistan, things were a lot simpler, you know?
you get your orders, you get your bullets, take your shot.
who do you think gets the intel to tell you where to point your rifle and take that shot?
a spy sitting in a car all day.
at least we got yogurt.
hold on. We have a guest.
Yep, that's Brandon, all right.
that son of a bitch.
hold on. Hold on. We talked about this.
we'll grab him on the way out.
whether you're kidnapping a ruthless dictator in a foreign country or snatching an abusive boyfriend off the street, it's best not to leave a mess behind.
using your target's own car as a getaway vehicle keeps neighbors from asking about the missing owner.
Plus, you don't have to pay for gas.
don't worry. We're not gonna hurt you.
we're just gonna ask you some questions.
you think you could beat on my sister and get away with it?
Ethan! - I didn't ...I d...
Ethan! He didn't give a beating. He took one.
what does that mean?
it means there's more to this than what we know.
look at his face.
stand down. Stand down.
you're all right. You're all right.
we're just gonna go for a little ride.
gonna sort this out.
Really?
I didn't touch your sister, man.
I would never hurt Heather.
then tell us who did.
it's my boss, Brad Ramsey.
he runs a medical-insurance scam in Homestead.
he'd give me money to pay off medical clerks.
I wanted to do something nice for Heather, so I skimmed some of the cash to take her away for the weekend.
and Ramsey found out.
Heather fought back. I tried to help.
you left her bleeding in the driveway of a hospital like a stray dog.
what was I supposed to do? - You were supposed to protect her!
and what about you, big bro?
Heather tried calling you for help, but you were too busy playing Captain America in Afghanistan.
interrogation 101...you lose your head, they stop talking.
you can skip the spy school.
this bastard is the reason Heather's breathing through a tube right now.
breaking his jaw is not gonna get him to talk.
go on. Cool off. Go outside.
okay.
Upsy-daisy. Stop crying.
you're all right.
now, if you don't cooperate, I'm gonna let Ethan come back in here and talk to you.
alone.
do you understand?
all right.
tell me everything you know about Brad Ramsey.
people tend to think spies are motivated by love of the game, desire for adventure, or patriotic fervor.
the truth, though, is that you don't choose a life as a covert operative unless something deeper is going on beneath the surface. something more personal, something harder to explain, and something a lot more painful.
I should have been there.
it wasn't your fault.
she was so beautiful.
now look at her.
if you want to get the guy who put her in here, I know how to do it.
so, that's the guy who beat my sister?
that's him.
Ramsey runs the scam, Brandon was wrapped up with.
the other chucklehead is Joel Davenport.
he steals Medicare numbers so Ramsey can use them to bilk the insurance companies.
these guys are ruining a lot of lives.
this clinic is used to help people, but now it's basically just a private ATM for these scumbags.
so the guy's even more of a bastard than we thought?
same plan as before, right?
dragging Ramsey to the police isn't an option now.
the cops were your idea, remember?
well, your sister basically helped rip off a scam artist.
man, I'm just saying the cops are not gonna make it a priority.
we grab him now, Ramsey spends a few hours behind bars.
he'll be out in time for happy hour.
now, on the other hand, if we can get him to show us the details of his little business, he'll rot in jail until you're old and gray.
we're just gonna politely ask him if we can see his scam?
you think that'll work?
no, I'll have to approach Ramsey as the kind of guy he'd want to talk to.
no. I'm approaching Ramsey.
was I unclear when I said I'm coming along every step of the way?
Ethan, you're not trained for this.
then train me.
when this is over, I want him to know it was me.
I owe that to Heather.
all right, kid. Fine.
you're gonna need a suit.
excuse me. We're looking for Brad Ramsey.
well, you found him.
we don't mean to spoil the party, but we'd like a few minutes of your time, talk a little business.
Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure that you guys aren't on the guest list.
just give us two minutes of your time.
no interruptions, no intrusions.
and I promise you, next year at this time, your vacation home in Rio will make this place look like a dollhouse.
let's talk over here.
what kind of business you guys in?
same as you.
only on a much bigger scale.
we can't go into much detail right now, but our network is pulling in some serious cash.
we'd like to bring you in.
I only work for one man-me.
I'm doing just fine on my own.
that's why we want you.
but why settle for "just fine" when you could be doing "great"?
you got to think bigger.
I mean, sure, your kiddy pool with a "view" is fine.
but the pool at our place on Star Island...now, that's great.
come to our party. Check it out.
who knows...maybe you'll like what we have to offer.
no offense...I mean, I'm sure you guys are doing great, but, uh, I got things under control.
we're talking the big time here, Ramsey.
you want to be bush league forever?
bush league?
who are you calling bush league?
uh, you'll have to forgive my young, enthusiastic friend.
when we found him, he was scraping by on 6 grand a week in a timeshare scam, so we had to drag him out of the gutter.
sometimes his passion gets ahead of his manners.
here's our info.
in case you change your mind about... Moving up in the world?
I have to get back to my guests.
feel free to stick around. Have a beer.
and then get the hell off my property.
I just blew it. - You did fine.
did you clock his face when I said "6 grand a week"?
we'll be seeing him again.
Hey, man.
what... I'm sorry.
am I in the...wrong... This is Michael Westen's place, right?
look, I knew Fi was gonna shake things up a little bit in here, but come on, now, man.
you got a breadbasket. Are you cool with all this?
Yeah, you know, it's, um...A process. - Right.
do you have an update on those phone records? - Yes.
but before I do, I just want to point out, even if you can dodge this frame-up thing, you and I could get into a lot of trouble for this.
I owe you, Jesse.
no, I mean, like, this is in violation of an executive order and a pretty big constitutional amendment.
I really owe you? - Yeah. You do.
okay. All these red dots represent cellphone calls made around Max's building.
now, if we eliminate all the calls made a half-hour before or after Max's death, anything with, uh, family plans, anything easily traceable, we are left with... One call.
made from a burner cell to a pay phone. Boom.
the killer was probably signaling that the job was done.
it's a dead end. - Oh, no.
you will not rain on my cellphone-magic parade, because I tracked the burner to the bodega that sold it.
I'm gonna go grab the security tapes and find out who bought it.
I really, really owe you, Jesse. - Yes, you do.
Sam, what's going on?
Ramsey just called.
said he can't wait to go to our party.
you would've been proud, Mikey.
watching Ethan work a cover was like seeing a baby take his first steps, only, you know, less adorable.
did your new lady friend get us a car?
ha, you call it a car.
I call it a work of art.
what about the house?
are we ready to introduce Ramsey to a new life?
Yeah, yeah. We're all set. But listen, Mike. Just so we're clear, nothing happens to big mama's wheels or the mansion.
cause once you've laid your head on 2, 000-thread-count sheets, you never want to go back to the couch.
Ohh, yeah.
is that potpourri that I'm smelling?
you're killing me, man.
jealousy is a delicate emotion.
show someone what they can't have, and they'll just resent you.
give it to them too easy, and they won't appreciate it.
they key is allowing them just enough of a taste so all they want is more.
our guest of honor.
I still can't believe I'm supposed to drink with the guy.
just think of it this way...every time the bastard cracks a smile, he's tightening the noose around his own neck.
Hey!
look who's here!
it's about time.
better late than never.
think our friend here needs a drink, yeah?
Yeah.
so I said,"Shoot the dog." - And so I did.
Oh, sorry, ladies.
come on, now. - Don't worry.
we'll get to them later.
there's somebody I want you to meet.
fast Eddie, Brad Ramsey.
the infamous Brad Ramsey.
bring it in here.
I've been called worse.
Yeah, I'll bet you have, man. - Hey, sit down, guys.
please, please.
so, Eddie here... Is the wizard behind our global network.
he sets up fake medical facilities that spit out real money.
it's easy, really.
a lot of places around the world, healthcare is 10% of the GDP.
it's so big, no one even notices when we take a little slice for ourselves, isn't that right?
that's just fancy talk for "We have a very good thing going.
Oh, look, I'm a little low.
why don't you fill him in? I'll be right back.
it seems like you guys got it all figured out.
what do you need me for?
one can never have too many friends.
south Florida is a...is a Medicare gold mine, okay?
our only problem is, we're not hooked up down here. You are.
so we want to see your whole network.
then we combine your ideas with our capital, everybody gets rich.
what, are you crazy?
it took me seven years to set up my business.
you think I'm just gonna hand it over?
no, w-we're not asking you to hand over anything, Ramsey.
this is a merger.
we get to see the details behind your operation, the mind that created it, and then you get all this.
there's the boss.
he blew off Pebble Beach to meet you.
shall we?
come on, man.
beautiful.
Eduardo. - Boss.
you must be Ramsey. Welcome aboard.
not so fast.
I ain't signing any dotted lines just yet.
did I hop on my G6 for a "Maybe"?
what can I say? The best don't come easy.
I'm sorry. - "I'm sorry"?
"I'm sorry" doesn't get me back on the links in time for the back nine, does it?
what's the holdup?
it's not his fault.
this seems too good to be true.
then your guys start asking details about my business.
I mean, how do I know you're not cops?
fair question.
deserves an honest answer.
cops write tickets.
cops eat doughnuts.
they don't do this.
son of a bitch!
careful. I learned jujitsu on the sands of Okinawa.
that's...that's my car!
no, that's not your car.
that's your car.
I call it the thinking car.
take your time. Have a ball.
thinking car? - Felt right at the time.
it felt...I don't give a damn how it felt. I better see my car again, Mike.
I know the feeling, buddy.
so, when are we finished with the car-giving phase.
I'd love to get to the ass-kicking phase.
seducing Ramsey with our scam is a process, Ethan.
he's inches away from giving us everything we need to take him down.
now, the more info we can ask him for about the scam, the more he's got to talk to his guys.
we drop a bug in those conversations, the cops are gonna have some easy listening.
so, what, I have to hang with him some more?
as soon as we get everything we need from the bug, you can break off your friendship, - but you have to be... - Patient. I know.
so, how do we get the bug on him?
well, Ramsey was damn near drooling over my watch, Mike.
great. Let's give him another gift.
Mike... What happened to the bench, the one with the work toys?
Fiona thought that she didn't want to mix work with... It's in the back now.
when bugging a watch, it's better to use a good-looking knock-off than its authentic counterpart, and not just because it's easier on your wallet.
the insides of a fake timepiece are usually smaller and simpler, leaving more room for hiding a listening device.
as long as your target isn't a watch connoisseur, zinc alloy and cubic zirconia are a great way of saying "Let's be friends.
Ramsey, my man.
here you go.
boss was glad you finally came to your senses. I was glad, too.
Yeah, I'll be glad when I start to see some serious green.
eager. Yeah, I like...I like that. It reminds me of me.
once you give the boss the details on your operation, we'll bring you up to speed on our system, and from there, smooth sailing.
look at this.
I got you a little welcome gift.
well, now. I think that'll look just great on me.
I got one just like it. I call it the lucky watch.
if I were you, I'd never take that thing off.
think I can do that.
all right. Come on. The guys are waiting for you.
a thousand bucks you hit nothing but water.
we'll see about that. Pull!
double or nothing?
look who I found.
if you're here, then you're done thinking.
that car can be pretty convincing. - Good.
now that you're coming on board, let's iron out the details.
we need to get an understanding of how you move your money around.
way ahead of you. This is the Medicare fee schedule from my last scam.
you came all the way here to waste our time?
this could have been written on a cocktail napkin!
what we're looking for is, well, everything.
all your doctor names, all your patient numbers, every little detail of your enterprise.
you give us that, then we can move forward.
triple or nothing?
I'll talk to my guys, put something together.
you do that.
and just so you know, I'm keeping the Porsche.
if you tried to give it back, I'd worry about you.
Yeah, uh, Mike, since Jesse's helping you with your little CIA problem, you might want to get his car back for him.
one problem at a time, Sam.
in certain neighborhoods, posing as a dirty cop is a great way to confiscate information.
it gives you the authority that comes with a badge and invokes the fear that comes with being a criminal.
Hello, there.
I'm Officer Stone.
we have ourselves a little situation.
last week, Officer Goodtimes over there came in here and bought a jug of vodka with his pay-by-the-hour friend.
stressful job, Sharon. Guy's got to blow off a little steam every now and again.
this guy knows what I'm talking about.
the thoroughly embarrassing evidence is all over your surveillance tapes, and we're gonna need them.
those tapes are pretty expensive.
I suppose I could part with them for, oh... 500 bucks?
you know what, it might be easier to throw your sorry ass in jail for those bootleg DVDs you got back there.
and selling booze to minors.
got a real state-of-the-art operation going on here, don't you?
it's everything from last month.
we're gonna need some popcorn.
got a better idea.
throw in a carton of smokes.
and I'm watching all of these why?
a friend of mine, he was murdered. The killer might be on one of these tapes.
what am I looking for exactly?
whenever you see someone buy a cellphone, mark the date and time.
well, it's your lucky day,'cause I'm boycotting my favorite soap this week.
Dr. Wesley broke off his engagement, and he moved to Alaska!
that's too bad.
how's it going with -- what's his name?
Ethan? He's holding his own.
Joel, Joel. Just give me the paperwork for the doctors' I. D.s.
how am I supposed to trust you?
what the hell are you talking about? I'm in charge of this.
your judgment's off lately!
those guys who gave you the Porsche...you don't even know them!
are you sure this is gonna work? - We'll make it work.
I talked to the other guys, and they all agree with me...you're a liability.
first, you put that girl in the hospital. If she recovers...
if that bitch recovers, I'm gonna finish her off! No big deal!
what... what are you doing? Let go of me.
Joel, I need you to listen to me very carefully.
he's talking about killing my sister. - You all right?
I got no problem putting you or any of the other guys in the hospital.
Yeah. I,uh, I just need to get some air.
this is my business, not yours. I make the decisions.
you're not even supposed to be back here.
we'll talk later.
O-okay, fine. I got it.
what do you want to bet he's going after Ramsey at the clinic?
then we better get there first.
where the hell is he?
Oh, Ethan's a sniper. He's not taking a shot from here.
he'd try to find a perch.
right there. 9:00.
man, that kid set up fast.
he wouldn't fire on Ramsey in a crowd, would he?
no. He's like Michael. He'll wait for a clear shot.
all right. Let's go. I'll talk him down.
it's too late. We need a distraction.
protecting a target from a bullet sometimes means taking a few shots at them yourself.
a near miss puts the target on their guard and keeps the real gunman at bay.
Fi. Fi, not my car!
relax. I'll just put one through the windshield.
but you can never predict how someone is going to react to a bullet whizzing by their head.
what the hell, man?!
just the windshield, Fi?
he was... - He never got a shot off.
fi fired first and scared Ramsey away, which is not to say it's a victimless crime because my car...
what the hell were you thinking?
you want to know what I was thinking?
I was thinking as long as I corrected for a slight breeze and pulled the trigger on my exhale, the guy who put my sister in the hospital wasn't going to exist anymore.
we had a deal. We had a plan.
Yeah, and your plan wasn't working!
it wasn't working as fast as you wanted it to. Big difference.
you got a way to bring the son of a bitch down before I retire? I'm all ears.
we needed Ramsey talking to his crew.
now he thinks someone's trying to kill him.
he's not gonna talk to his crew. He's not gonna talk to anyone. He's gonna ...
three voicemails in the last hour. Ramsey can't stop calling me.
Oh, come on. That's a little funny.
dude's reaching out to the guy that, um, tried to kill him.
I'm sorry.
Ethan, we can still use this.
things are already tense in Ramsey's crew.
you call him. You tell him... - No, no, no, no, no!
I'm done pretending to be this bastard's friend!
all right, so, uh, well, it sounds like you want to turn Ramsey on his own crew, pin the shooting on them?
but the only person who can run point just walked out the door.
And? - He is not an option.
unless you want to be in the room standing between Ethan and Ramsey.
familiar scene out there.
you remember when you came home on leave that first time?
you spent hours out there the day that you found out that Patrick Garney had stolen your girlfriend.
and then you stole his motorcycle and drove it into the Miami River.
mom, I think this is a little different.
if you say so.
how many years of training did it take before you learned to curb your anger, Michael?
the man you are today is not the boy who left home.
you were a scared kid when you left.
you were angry at the world. You were angry at everything.
I've seen loved ones get hurt.
I've never plotted to kill anyone in cold blood.
no. Your mother raised you better than that.
someone has to teach him, Michael.
you can save it.
you want Ramsey dead, and you don't think I have anything to say worth listening to.
well, I understand that feeling.
so, uh... Do you want to compare body counts?
all right. If it's gonna be that kind of talk.
actually, it's not.
I'm telling you I know more about this than you do.
you're not in a war zone anymore, Ethan.
so you're saying you think I'll regret killing the guy 'cause this isn't a battlefield?
listen to me. I won't. I want to finish this my way.
you don't get to do what you want to do.
you lost that right the moment your sister got beaten.
what's that supposed to mean?
your life doesn't belong to you.
your decisions affect other people.
you need to start thinking about Heather.
that is what I'm doing.
you can't help her from jail.
you know who acts out of selfish anger?
the Ramseys of this world.
and that's their weakness.
and that's what you use to destroy them.
what do I do?
you look Ramsey in the eye one last time.
you go to bat for him.
you convince him you are his best friend.
and when he's ready to burn his whole life to cinders...
you hand him the match.
Ramsey! Ramsey! - Come on.
Ramsey, what the hell's going on?
come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
someone shot at me coming out of the clinic.
I hope to God you're kidding. Someone's shooting at him.
we're through here. Thanks for playing. Next.
whoa, hold on. Hold on.
every problem's got a solution. Does anyone have a reason to shoot at you?
do you have any problems? I mean, do any of your people know about our deal?
my guys? Oh, they would...they would never.
all right. Well, wait. There was...there...there was one...
there was one guy that was pissed that I was talking to you.
every time we work with amateurs, the minute money's on the table, people start shooting.
okay, but it's his people. It's not him. So give the guy a break.
you can take care of this the way you did for me.
hold on. What are you talking about?
he means turn your crew over to the cops. Are you slow?
that's how we got rid of the kid's baggage when he started working for me.
turn the cops on my crew?
if they're shooting at you, they're not your crew anymore.
if you're working with us, we got to tie up loose ends.
I can't... - Ramsey!
this is the moment, all right?
if you want to work with us, this deal could pull in $50 mil a year.
that's 10% for you. That's your cut.
$5 million?
Yeah, but you don't get any of that unless you can take care of your problems here.
what's it gonna be?
kid, let's go. - All right, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
all right. I can do this, okay? Yes.
change your shirt. You look like a hick.
call our guys. Let's get this done.
this is everything I got.
you sure none of this is gonna point back at me?
not that it matters.
you'll be on the beach in the Caymans.
maybe you'd like a little company.
all right.
love to stay for the fun part, but we got to jet.
what's this for? - It's for the house.
we're making sure nothing connects any of this to you.
you want me to burn my own house down?
uh, yeah. Come on, Ramsey. Be serious.
how many parties have you had in this place?
your crew has fingerprints everywhere, hair, DNA, all kinds of crap.
believe me. We're gonna set you up with a new place to call home.
for a spy, revenge is a dish that is rarely served at all.
the mission objective always takes priority over personal satisfaction.
care to do the honors?
but if conning a scam artist into burning everything he's worked his whole life to build serves that mission, it's hard not to take a little joy in watching it all go up in flames.
come on, man. Don't sweat it. The boss has got the jet fueled and ready.
blink, and we'll be in Monaco.
I take it everything went well. - Like a dream.
great. I'll tell the pilot we're ready to take off.
if you have any other loose ends...Now's the time to speak up.
Nope. No loose ends.
wait, what was that? You...what, you think of something?
no, man, it's nothing. It's...it's all good.
look, if you're holding something back and the boss finds out about it later, he's gonna drop your body off that jet.
there is something.
it's just this bitch. Okay?
I beat her down. I-I put her in the hospital.
is there a problem?
no, we're fine. We're just working out one last little...kink.
some bitch in a hospital bed?
then you need to take care of it.
what do you mean, take care of it?
little poison in the I. V.and she'll sleep forever.
kill her?
listen, you can wrap this up or you can hang here with your boys, wait till they rat you out, and let the cops drag you.
it's your choice.
clock's ticking.
okay. I-I'll do it. I'll put the bitch out of her misery.
a soldier on the battlefield would never dream of intentionally putting a dangerous weapon in the hands of an enemy.
but as a spy, sometimes the only way to solve a problem is trusting a bad guy to do what comes naturally.
and if you help with the plan, you know exactly how to make them fail.
drop it! Put the needle down!
what, man? Get off of me!
get him out of here! - Get off of me, man!
I was set up! I was set up!
you got him? - Great.
I would have felt so guilty if something bad would have happened.
no, uh, I'd rather not give my name. I don't even know the guy. I'm just a citizen doing my duty.
Hey, hey! That's the guy! That's the guy who set me up! That's the guy!
it's open.
I just got back from the hospital.
it's still touch-and-go with Heather, but she's through the worst patch, so...
I'll be by her side every day. - Good.
Sam called with some more good news.
looks like Ramsey's enjoying his jail time with all the guys he ratted out.
I'm offended he didn't call me first.
I thought we were friends.
I should tell you...I did some thinking, and I'm having lunch with those CIA recruiters next week.
what is it?
well, I was wondering... Does, um, does it ever get any easier?
no. It never does.
well, can you at least tell me this...if you could do it all over again, would you?
it's who I am.
I don't know how to be anybody else.
not really an answer, but I guess, uh, I guess it'll do.
take care of yourself, Michael.
w-wait, so that's it on the forensics, then?
I want answers, not excuses.
all right, you know what? Don't even bother.
I don't want to read a 20-page field report on how you found nothing.
Langley's all over my ass, Michael, and my leads are evaporating left and right.
Max's financial records, nothing. Traffic cams, nothing.
you better have brought me something to chew on. Thank you.
could be something.
found a burner cell in the records you gave me.
phone was purchased at a bodega on 6th.
they have a security camera?
you already got the footage.
I don't want to know how. I just want answers.
already sifting through the tapes.
I'll have something to report soon.
you'll have a report for me tomorrow.
isn't that what I just said?
I'm counting on you here.
so is Max's family.
mom? Got your call.
did you find something on the tape?
Michael, you need to tell me what this is all about right now.
I already told you. My friend
you told me that the security tape would lead to the man who killed your friend.
and I know you've spared me some details.
I need them now.
the person who killed my friend went to a lot of trouble to make it look like I did it.
I'm hoping the real killer is on that tape.
you need to see this.
he has your posture, your...your walk.
he's got you down, Michael.
good luck convincing anybody else it isn't you.
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing, no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies... a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too... Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate. -Someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line... as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
there's a long tradition of using doubles in espionage.
they're mostly used by dictators who want to confuse would-be assassins, but they have other less-common uses, like framing someone for a crime they didn't commit.
okay, I know this video is grainy. But from that angle, it sure looks like you.
it's not me, Sam.
I assume the burner cellphone he's buying made a call from the site of Max's murder.
somebody went to a lot of trouble to do this.
they didn't find this guy sitting at a bus stop.
she's right, Mike. This is starting to feel personal.
it's been personal since Max bled out in my arms, since he told me to say goodbye to his wife.
so, what's the plan to keep my son out of prison?
we got to track down the fella on this tape.
I mean, that's step one in finding Max's killer.
actually, step one is deciding what to do with the bloodhound the CIA sent to replace Max.
Pearce knows we have the security footage.
I can buy us some time.
I'll tell her it's taking a little longer to analyze the footage.
speak of the devil.
agent Pearce, right on time. I...
got it.
what's up? She got something new about the murder?
no, it wasn't about that. She wants to meet tomorrow morning, 7：00.
she's got another job for me, high priority at the CIA.
wish me luck.
you're only five minutes early.
I'm sorry. Is this a rush job?
very much so.
Pearce, hunter of CIA.
we have a source inside a Serbian syndicate.
he informed us the group is about to purchase a stolen Predator Drone from an arms dealer in Miami.
really none of that sounds good.
we don't have much on the deal other than it might be going down tomorrow and the arms dealer sent a courier.
the man's holed up in room 642 of this hotel.
we have to get the drone before the Serbians do, Michael.
now, normally, we'd bring a team, but this is very time-sensitive.
and you'd rather not have someone on the agency payroll doing it.
exactly. Our intel describes him as well-armed, well-trained, and very unfriendly.
it actually says "Very unfriendly" in the file.
they made a specific notation.
okay, I'm gonna need some climbers, chalk, and a small charge.
and I'm gonna need them quickly.
I'd like to do this before the pool opens and I have an audience.
I got to say, Westen.
you are a lot more agreeable than the notations in your file indicate.
just saying.
careful. That's a dicey hold you got there, Westen.
spare me the commentary, please. This requires some concentration.
when confronting an armed enemy, the big question is what weapons they're bringing to the fight.
trick your enemy into bringing the wrong weapon, and you've got the advantage.
time to say hello.
someone thinks they're taking fire from a sniper, for example, they'll choose something long range with a long barrel.
which won't do you much good in close combat.
Where's the drone?
it's not here.
it's gone. I delivered it last night.
I swear.
search the room. The cash is right there.
did he just say... -Let me put it this way...
either he just found a million dollars in cash on the street... Or we're too late.
listen to me, Manaro. You do that, and the situation you're talking about gets uglier than a dumpster fire.
compromising a source is not a...
fine. Then it's on your head!
so, how'd that go? - Our guy who's in with the Serbians is good.
he's reliable, and his cover is about as deep as it gets.
because of him, we know who they are, where they are, what they're doing on three continents.
now my bosses want to snatch up a few Serbs and interrogate them about this missing drone.
they do that, the asset gets outed.
my asset gets killed.
how well do you know the asset?
I only met him once... five minutes at a café.
but the guy's got a family. He coaches soccer. He's got a life.
this happened to me once before.
I ran an op in Paris back in 03.
the asset was a scientist... Jansen Tunberg.
and he was more than an asset.
we were getting married once it was over.
I see.
only before I could bring the op home, the boss got impatient.
they ordered more drastic measures.
they exposed Jansen.
I buried him a month before our wedding day.
I'm sorry.
so am I.
well... I have my orders.
Pearce, you think you could convince Langley to give you one more shot with that drone?
Why? To what end?
you buy me a few days, and I can get it back without CIA involvement.
I'm not sure they'd go for it.
you want to keep your asset alive? I can do this.
I want to do this. You'll owe me one.
I like your confidence, but we can't just push pause on Max's murder investigation.
you give me some operating room and equipment,
I'll give you progress on Max's killer and that stolen drone.
not just progress... I need them both. Fast.
well, they're impressive. I'll give them that.
a dozen ex-military Serbians, armed to the teeth.
and nasty Serbian.
look, I sure as hell don't want guys like that hanging onto a Predator Drone.
but, Mike, it's gonna take an army to get it back.
I agree. That's why we need help from someone who has an army.
we're gonna trick our old friend Carmelo into going after the Serbs.
as the second biggest heroin dealer in Miami?
he's helped us track down mercenaries before.
he's perfect for this.
Yeah, but isn't the last thing he said to you...
"if I ever see you again, you're dead"?
that's why I was hoping you could handle the Carmelo thing.
Oh, how generous. What is your plan, exactly?
we rip off Carmelo and leave Sam behind as a witness to the heist.
he questions you. You steer him towards the Serbs.
we play it right, he hunts for his heroin and finds our drone instead.
and if we don't play it right, we find out if Sam is bulletproof.
I know it's dangerous. But if we don't do something, the CIA's source is dead, and some very bad people end up with a really dangerous weapon.
Sam, I'll understand if you...
no. You're right. That's the play.
all right. I'll go find us a heroin shipment.
for a spy, one of the most useful contacts in the criminal underworld is the small-time drug dealer.
their work demands that they stay informed about their rivals, their suppliers, the police, and any other bad guys who might be operating in their area.
sugar - Now's not a good time. - Oh, now's good.
ladies, this is Fiona. She's a very dear friend who would never dream of interrupting this magical time we're all having together.
Oh, of course not.
if you have found some friends that are okay with your medical condition, I wouldn't dream of imposing.
medical condition.
it's not a big deal, really. There are plenty of ways to manage the symptoms.
she's joking. She actually has a very dark, twisted sense of humor.
um, yeah, I think we're actually gonna leave.
it's... What do you want?
I want to know about Carmelo Dante's heroin shipments.
Why? - Because he's about to lose one.
forget it. You rob him, he sucks the marrow out of your bones.
I like my marrow... Inside of my bones.
uh, did Carmelo shoot you in the kneecap?
or was that Michael Westen? Because he is the one asking.
look... Everybody in the game knows Carmelo's guys take a rental car to a stash house up in the sticks, just to re-up.
it's right off of 95, north of Fort Lauderdale.
Oh, see, that wasn't so hard now, was it?
this is some serious death-wish material here.
you know why it's okay everybody knows about his stash house?
cause nobody's stupid enough to hit it.
somebody is.
that's your plan? I don't like it.
well, you and me both, lady, but there's no other way.
are you saying the agency never tricks third parties into attacking our enemies?
times have changed.
of course we do, but a "yojimbo" play is a hail Mary to pull off, not to mention reckless.
Yeah, well, as the guy who's about to put his head in the lion's mouth, I'd appreciate it if you'd stop reminding me.
we both know anything involving the cops or the FBI will tip the Serbs off.
this gets us the drone back and keeps the CIA out of it.
look, all we're asking for is a listening device so we can stay in touch when I'm with Carmelo.
here. You're gonna have to sign the gear out.
it ain't cheap. Manaro's gonna love this.
did she just say Manaro? - Yeah, why?
well, it's a long story, but I got kind of a rocky past with that guy and that part of the CIA... I mean, it's kind of hush-hush, but Manaro's half the reason for it, so...this could get a little sticky.
great.
frame is bugged. Long-range, extra battery.
hope you can pull off glasses, Mr. Axe.
well, they're not exactly my style, but I think Chuck Finley can rock the specs.
okay.
will you give us a minute? I need a moment alone with Michael.
sure. I'll wait in the car.
three feet on the floor, you two.
I thought you'd have something from that security footage you pulled by now.
do you need help with it?
Oh, I'd love some. But I doubt you want me turning over stolen evidence.
we need to put the pedal down, Westen, so tell me how I can help.
can you get me some advanced facial-recognition software?
good. It might speed things up.
it better.
well, go on.
you've got a heroin shipment to steal.
the key to rob an armed transport is to stop the vehicle without putting the guards on the defensive.
okay, the drug mobile's right on time.
get ready to take the shot.
shooting a tire can cause a blowout without arousing suspicion, but it takes a gifted sniper to hit a target moving 40 miles per hour.
and now for round 2.
what the hell?! Where is it coming from?!
let's just get out of here!
half a million dollars worth of junk.
I think Carmelo should be pretty well-motivated to find the Serbs who ripped him off.
you ready? -Getting there.
how injured do we want our innocent witness?
well, injured enough to make it look like I was grazed by a bullet.
but not so injured that the ladies mind.
well, you know, what they say about guys who wear glasses are less likely to get shot in the face by heroin dealers.
Sam, we'll have you covered for the pick-up.
after that... ...Good luck.
Thanks.
staging a scene is one of the most important deception techniques in espionage.
you're telling a story, arranging evidence for someone to discover so they'll believe what you want them to.
if it works, there's nothing like it.
if it doesn't work, well, it's good to be nearby with a sniper rifle.
Carmelo, the second biggest herion dealer in Miami.
so, where were they hiding?
the gunmen... The ones that you sent you running off like little bitches, this badass crew that separated you from my dope.
now, you... you said there was a dozen, right?
where did a dozen guys park their cars?
tell me. Because I don't see it!
that guy!
there was a tow truck here earlier.
he was here.
sleepyhead, sleepyhead.
wake up. Wake up. Wake up!
Where's...My...Car?
your what? Your car? How the hell should I know, pal?! I...
you expect me to believe that you were just joyriding in a tow truck?
all right, we'll try this again.
okay, okay, look.
I just drove the truck, all right? That's it. I swear.
some guys with accents called me. They said they'd make it worth my while.
how's that working out for you? -Not so good.
I woke up in a ditch.
you start talking... Or I will bury you right over there.
I got nothing against you.
and I don't know where your car is, okay?
my name's Chuck. You think I'm tight with a bunch of Serbians?!
Serbians? - The guys who ripped you off.
take a look, pal! They tried to shoot me in the head!
for crying out loud, I'd be dead by now if they bothered to check their work.
I think you know more than you're saying...
so you and I are gonna go and have a discussion... About your Serbian friends.
with my what?! Hey, guys! Guys!
for a spy, there's no greater victory than successfully inserting an asset into a hostile organization.
of course, it's a little hard to celebrate that victory when the hostile organization is a bunch of trigger-happy drug dealers and the asset is your best friend.
the first moments of an infiltration are crucially important.
that's when you're establishing yourself...
what you know about them, what they know about you, and, most importantly, how useful you're going to be.
do you have any idea who I am?
does the name Carmelo Dante mean anything to you?
Carm...wait. W-what?!
Oh, my God.
Oh, no. Yes, yes, yes.
of course I-I-I'm familiar with your reputation.
come on. Do you think I would be crazy enough to steal from you?
whether you knew or not, Chuck... You helped rob me.
Oh, no.
give me one reason why I shouldn't open you up! - Come on!
if the target decides you're useful, you're in.
if they decide you're not useful, you're usually dead.
okay. You want a reason? How about this one?
you kill me, you'll never find them.
you think you're pissed? The sons of bitches shot at me!
let me help you find them so I can watch them squirm.
help? I thought you didn't know anything.
I know a few names. I know where they hang out. I know some stuff.
but if you stick that blade in me, they're gone!
then the whole town hears that somebody ripped you off and they got away clean.
you want that?
all right.
you are by my side until I get my drugs.
I can't believe you sent Sam in there with this guy.
he's the only guy with the connections to track down a Serbian stash house and the manpower to take them on.
thanks to Sam, Carmelo thinks they're sitting on his heroin instead of a Predator Drone.
okay, so Sam points Carmelo towards the Serbians, Carmelo hits the Serbians.
why do you need me?
I need you to convince the Serbs they have a new enemy named Carmelo.
establishing a cover as a drug addict isn't glamorous, but it has its advantages.
people don't expect addicts to be rational... - Thank you.
so they don't question their motives.
nothing explains an unwanted intrusion quite like the impression that you're high as a kite.
fellas, fellas, fellas.
what is up? What is going down? What is the word?
you choose wrong table. Djovic.
Djovic
huh, yeah. See? Got his attention.
so, let me tell you guys a little story.
I'm... Wow.
that is magical. Have you tried this? Want to get on some?
...Hanging with my buddy. He's not my buddy.
he's my hookup. He's my hookup. He's my dealer. He's my guy.
last night, he was talking to his boss about you, on the phone, talking about "Joe-vich," "Joe-vick." Am I saying that right?
who is this person that talks all this?
what? - Spit it out.
Yes. No. We need to discuss a financial arrangement, okay?
Yes. Financial arrangement, how you say?
you know, a couple hun, couple hundo, couple... honey... honey bears.
you know what we can do? We can negotiate the fee later.
I'm cool with that if you are. That's fine.
what you need to know is that he is gearing up for you, man.
he's coming at you hard... like big guns, big, heavy guns.
who is this that comes for us?
Carmelo Dante. Kingpin, heroin guy, armored Rolls-Royce.
you see that? - What does this Carmelo want?
he's territorial about his territory.
and he doesn't like people bringing attention to what he's got coming in and out, okay?
and he's happy to spray anyone that does bring attention to it with a shower of lead.
Pow... one for you. Pow... one for you.
so let's discuss my fee.
we let you keep your teeth. Fair?
no. That's not fair. Come on.
come on. No, no, no, no, no.
get him out of here! - Come on!
this is not... This is not how we do things in the U. S. of A.
not all of the intelligence spies use is stolen or even secret.
when the information you need involves a lot of data...
like searching for a single face in the population of Miami...
what you really need is accessing to the right database, which is usually behind the counter at the closest government agency.
I can't believe the boys get to go up against heroin pushers and arms traffickers and I'm here stuck in the county clerk's office... in these earrings.
Hey, I love those earrings.
and we're here to keep your boyfriend out of jail.
next.
sir, why don't you go ahead?
why is he going ahead? - I already scouted.
we want the sweet lady with the photos of her daughter on her desk.
she is gonna love our little duet.
can I help you?
well, I sure hope so...Peggy.
we're trying to find this man.
this Romeo wiped out my daughter's entire bank account.
we thought that maybe you might be able to help us.
I'm sorry. This is the county clerk's office. I think you need the police.
we tried that, honey.
and they couldn't help us yet because, well, you see,
Mary never got his name.
well, he said his name was Dave.
he said a lot of things, honey.
and not all of them were probably true.
the one thing I do know is that Dave...
I think he's licensed to drive in the state of Florida.
and his birth date is March 4th.
he had a real nice car.
and he got a lot of "Happy Birthday" calls.
he has a lot of people fooled.
look, you have, uh, government computers, right?
I mean, I know it's just a long shot, but, you know, if you might let us look through all the driver's licenses, then he might just pop up.
ma'am, I would love to help you, but our records are confidential.
don't cry, babe.
it's all right. It's all right. Mommy's here.
is that your daughter? So sweet.
bet you'd do anything for her, right?
Yeah.
well, mother to mother, that bastard broke my girl's heart.
well, it may just be a needle in the haystack.
you know, we got to try. You understand?
come back Saturday. I'll help you.
Oh, God bless you, Peggy.
so, these Serbians... you're sure you know where they are?
okay. Yeah. No, no. This is the neighborhood. It's just a couple blocks up.
they're based out of a... a trucking company or something like that.
when we get there, they're not gonna be happy to see us, you know.
the way these Eastern Europeans smoke,
I worry they're not gonna be able to keep up when the shooting starts.
well, they better start limbering up because here comes Carmelo.
okay, here we go... Serb central. But I wouldn't get too close.
this where my stuff is?
here at the H. Q?
Oh, no, no, no. Those guys aren't that stupid, no.
they'll keep it someplace safe till they ship it out of the country.
do me a favor, Chuck? Shut your mouth.
I'm thinking. - Thinking?
he's not gonna find that drone staring at those pasty bastards until they're tan.
no, but he'll start looking right after the bullets stop flying.
allow me. We've already established that I'm a better shot.
cellphone... slightly smaller target than a car tire.
what there - Get us out of here! - Do you want to play?
Oh, man. Oh, no!
what the... oh!
grab him! Now!
what the hell are you doing?!
seizing an opportunity... very important in my business.
maybe he can tell us where my dope is.
Oh, great. The new guy gets the window seat.
Michael... He's got a Serbian now. - I know.
Sam's story.
every lie he told's all gonna get checked now.
Carmelo's gonna find out the Serbs didn't rob him.
Sam will make it work. - You don't know that.
no, I don't.
well, it doesn't sound like too much fun in there, huh?
Carmelo does his own dirty work, does he?
he... is he good at interrogation?
shut up, man. - Hey, look, we're on the same side.
that Serb runs with the guys that shot me.
maybe you talked too much, pissed them off.
Yeah.
but seriously, you were in there earlier.
I mean, was he talking or just, you know, screaming?
Yeah, he said his name was Vlad.
he was talking about some marina down by the Port of Miami.
he did a lot of begging.
damn. Well, I'm...
sure there's still time for this to work out, Mike.
my name's Rico. - All right, sounds like he's got this.
I don't care what Sam is saying. I think we should go get him.
Fi! Fi! How? Carmelo has an army.
20 guys? That's an army?
it's enough, Fi.
so we are supposed to... what?
... sit on our hands while Sam's head is on the block?
if this has a happy ending, that's great.
what's plan "B"?
this is an agency operation.
if he needs support... if it comes to that, I can ask Pearce.
so ask her. And then ask her, where was the agency's support when you volunteered Sam to be taken prisoner by a heroin dealer?
so, you want us to pull him out?
no, I just want you to be ready to pull him out, maybe put a chopper and a couple of teams on ready alert.
remember when I said I didn't like your plan?
the plan can still work.
Carmelo has his men scouring the city for a Serbian stash house.
I'm just asking... in case things go sideways with Sam.
Yeah.
we need to talk about Sam.
you Westen?
do you want to tell us why the name Sam Axe is appearing on equipment-requisition forms?
you really put a $40, 000 bug on that man's face?
which one should I answer?
Michael, this is Gabriel Manaro and Matt Bailey.
guys, this is... - Oh, we know who he is.
he's the genius who involved a heroin dealer in a classified CIA field operation...
not to mention Sam Axe.
Sam mentioned there was a dustup with whichever one of you is Manaro.
a-a dustup? You could say that. We're not fans.
so, when did you work with Sam?
five years ago, he compromised a CIA facility in Colombia.
he endangered a mission and its personnel.
specifically us.
Yeah. I'm sure he had his reasons.
okay. Focus.
Mr. Axe's position with Carmelo Dante is... precarious.
his story's being checked against a captured Serb.
michael thinks we need the cavalry on call.
what cavalry?
what's with this guy?
you put an asset in the field.
I put my friend in the field.
now, I haven't asked for anything yet.
but if I do, you better be ready.
I wouldn't hold my breath.
this mission comes first.
I got to go. It's gonna be a long night. Is there anything else?
keep me posted. If you need help, I'll do what I can for Sam. Good luck.
Chuck... You will not believe what Vlad Miglo-whatever-his-name told me.
Yeah. I heard.
he was talking about a marina that they use, which fits with what my guys on the street are saying.
okay, well, there you go... exactly... Hey!
excuse me, Chuck. I wasn't done.
he said that they were shipping some weapon... not my drugs, not my heroin.
are you gonna call Pearce, or am I?
look, if Sam can't talk his way out of this, it'll be too late, anyway.
he can talk his way out of it.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
it's such a shock that some Serbian scumbag took prisoner would lie to save his own life.
he might say the same thing about you.
Oh, wait. That's right. He did... ...Right before he passed out.
are you in a rush?
you can't wait for the guy to wake up to get some real answers? Put the gun down!
traditionally, it's the guy with the gun who gives the orders.
all right, fine. Please put the gun down.
you got to let me lean on the son of a bitch.
I can trip him up with what I know about his partners.
Carmelo, I guarantee you...
you let me talk to this guy, he will change his tune about what's at that marina.
a guarantee from a guy with a gun to his head.
hell, you can take that straight to the bank.
all right.
you get one shot.
okay. He bought himself some time.
that's Madeline. We're supposed to go back to the county clerk's office.
you should go. There's nothing we can do for Sam from here.
I guess you're right.
look, don't worry about it, Mike. It's Sam.
it's Sam. He's gonna pull it out.
this has every current Florida license.
if the con man you're looking for is local, he's in here.
and we can search by age range or birth date and it'll show us photos?
Yes, but you're still gonna be looking at thousands of licenses.
not to say that it's impossible, but... It could take days.
and you only have until 2: 00.
my daughter has a dance recital. I'm sorry.
no, don't you dare apologize. You're too sweet.
we might get a lucky break.
well, I'm gonna go keep an eye out, but, um, my fingers are crossed for you.
Oh, thank you.
the most advanced computer is worse at identifying faces than a newborn.
unless a photo is taken straight on under direct lighting, facial-recognition software is nearly worthless.
fortunately, driver's license photos are taken straight on under direct lighting for exactly that reason.
why aren't we lighting up those dots all over the guy on the video?
it's not a good enough angle. But this will work.
whoever hired that imposter probably found him this way.
62, 000 people look like Michael? Oh, come on.
you heard the lady. We don't have that kind of time.
just give me a second to narrow it down.
you are as impatient as Michael.
is something bothering you? Besides me.
your son wrapped Sam up in one of his CIA missions.
he knew it was dangerous. He knew it.
and now... - What?
Sam is in real trouble.
I see.
86 matches. That's more like it. Let's make this quick.
we don't want to let Peggy be late for her daughter's recital.
you're a liar. You were there. Admit it.
you were there when your buddy laid out the whole thing...
where I was supposed to be with the truck, how you were gonna steal the dope.
you tell the truth, it'll go a lot easier on you.
never seen this man in life.
nice. Yeah.
damn, that dude is made of solid steel.
enter - Enough of this. - No.
I can save you a bullet. I can prove that he's lying.
then get on with it!
go to his place, and you'll see.
my place?
Yeah. Yeah, please. Go to my place.
I stay at Sunview Motel, Room 1-4.
okay. Good. There you go. That's it.
I'm telling you. The drugs were there.
what the hell is he doing? - He's calling his shot.
now it's up to us.
Yeah, the Sunview Motel... that's, like, halfway to Fort Lauderdale. Carmelo's a lot closer.
there was a scale, some dope, a couple of guns, and yogurt...
lots of yogurt. Don't ask me why.
yogurt? You lie.
blueberry yogurt.
good to see he hasn't lost his sense of humor.
think Fi's gonna be pissed we took the car?
I like to think she'll be impressed it saved Sam's life.
here. Tell Pearce where we are. She needs to navigate for us.
navigation systems combine data from traffic helicopters, police scanners, and road sensors to estimate the driving time along your route.
but compiling all that data creates a time lag.
30th is a parking lot. You're gonna want to take 23rd.
after that, we good to take the Causeway?
go for it. But use Grant when you get across.
there's still no quicker way to get across town than being guided by somebody who has access to real-time satellite imagery
the Sunview Motel. You live in a dump, Vlad.
Carmelo, I need a minute.
I said I need a minute!
keep having to drag your ass, that's all you're gonna get.
okay, look... Look, I just wanted to say that, um, what you're gonna see in there is gonna piss you off.
and while I think Vlad here is, you know, pretty much dogmeat, he's not the mastermind or anything, so it's those other guys you should go after.
if I wanted your opinion on how to run my business, I'd beat it out of you.
this is not...
I did not... - They moved it.
at least now I know who's telling the truth.
take him inside. Take care of him.
no, no. I tell truth.
okay. See? So you can tell I wasn't lying about those bastards.
did he say where he was gonna keep the stuff? - Box Key Marina.
okay, then my job is done here.
I don't need a ride. I'll just... I'll just catch a cab.
you said I could go.
I said that you would stay by my side till this is over. And I meant it.
Rico, call the guys.
tell them to load their guns. We're gonna go get my drugs.
make the call!
well, since you put it that way...
No! We need ops support right now.
tell them to get to Box Key Marina. The minute...
Westen, we can't...
the minute Carmelo's guys attack the Serbs, we go in hard.
we pull Sam out. You get your drone. I get my guy.
as long as we wait until the Serbs are neutralized, we have deniability.
it'll look like the cops breaking up a gunfight.
our source will be safe.
that many boots on the ground with bullets flying could compromise the mission.
once we've confirmed that Carmelo has found the drone, the police move in, as planned.
but maybe we can have... - We proceed as planned.
Sam bet his life that the Serbs have Carmelo's drugs.
when they find a Predator Drone instead, how long you think before they shoot Sam?!
well, we'll just have to hope he waits until the cops arrive.
you do not leave your people swinging in the wind like this.
Sam's not our people. He's not mission critical.
Michael. I'm sorry.
just keep these bastards off my back. I'll take care of it myself.
so, what's the plan?
the plan is, my guys will shoot a bunch of bullets at the Serbs.
the bullets will enter their bodies and kill them.
then we check the cargo, and you pray that my drugs are still there. Got it?
bullets, death, drugs. Got it.
well, at least part of the plan worked. Carmelo sure found the spot.
a bunch of armed Serbs on guard duty. I think we found the drone.
looks like Carmelo brought his whole crew. It's gonna get bloody here.
when I'm close, I'll need a distraction.
we got it. Go.
damn, it's like one of those nature documentaries where a snake eats the other snake.
I can never watch those.
Really? I love those.
for a spy, sneaking into the middle of a gun battle to pull someone out is one of the less popular assignments.
it's mostly about timing.
go in too early, and you have both sides shooting at you.
go in too late, and, well, you're too late.
there we go. Victory is mine.
what the hell was that? Lock it down out there.
sorry. I couldn't let it happen twice in one week.
how we looking? - Boss, I got nothing. Our stuff isn't here.
Chuck, we need to have a little talk because this looks a lot like a weapon and nothing like my heroin.
right. I agree. But there's got to be a second stash house.
it doesn't mean they didn't rip you off.
stop lying, before I kill you.
now, answer one question...
who the hell are you?!
that's my friend Sam, and I would really like it if you stopped pointing that gun at him.
you.
thank God. I was starting to think these didn't work.
who the hell is this guy?
that's... Michael Westen.
and he used to be a spy.
we're acquainted, unfortunately.
you hear those sirens, Carmelo?
the cops are gonna get here in a few minutes.
and when they do, you can explain either double homicide and a stolen weapon, or you can take my offer.
Oh, it better be a very good offer.
I have new friends at the CIA.
you surrender with us, we turn over the weapon, and you will walk away from this.
or I have a better idea.
I could kill you and leave before the cops get here.
that is not a bad plan, except for the fact that I have a sniper outside - You can take this one. - Seriously? Thank you. Thank you.
so, what is it?
are you a drug dealer who killed two CIA assets and stole a Predator Drone or a hero who found stolen military technology and seized it for the American government?
it's your call.
seriously...
I will kill you if I ever see you again.
Yeah, I've heard that before.
beers, Mike. I'm in the mood for multiple beers.
Michael. Sam. That was a hell of a job you two pulled off.
I'm making a special notation in your files.
and you brought my car.
I thought I'd spare you the cab fare. It seemed the least I could do.
well, thanks. You two, get your bony asses off the hood.
you look pretty pleased with yourselves for a couple of guys who just cut a deal with a drug kingpin.
what the hell were you thinking? You know, we told you...
you said the Serbs couldn't find out the CIA was involved.
but Carmelo finding out...
that wasn't "Mission critical," was it?
do you really expect us to make good on immunity for that bastard?
actually, I do, because if you let him go to jail, that bastard has no incentive to keep his mouth shut.
if we keep him out on the street, you really think...
maybe Pearce can explain it to you.
ask her to talk real slow, and you might get it.
as long as Carmelo's got a reputation to protect...
well, that's just beautiful, but have you heard the story he told the cops?
the guy said he went to the marina with his buddies for a picnic.
then Serbs attacked, out of nowhere.
Oh, but luckily, Carmelo had the sense to bring all these automatic weapons with him to the picnic, you know, instead of food.
this is the official story we get to sell to the Miami police. - Yeah, this is what we get to do with this Carmelo guy.
this is the mess you are leaving us with! - Immunity. Fantastic.
Yeah, well, sucks being you, but I guess that's nothing new, right?
Mr. Axe! Not so fast. We need our glasses back.
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
I... Lost them.
Sam, I just want to say... - You don't have to, Mike.
I was gonna say you owe me one.
and I owe you 50.
there they are. The best actress and best supporting actress at the Dade County Clerk's Office.
do you mean,"Thank you both so much for finding that impersonator that was used to frame you?"
I do. That's what I mean.
so, what did you find?
it's all right here. But first, we need to talk.
you are taking big risks, Michael...
putting Sam in danger, getting involved in the CIA investigation that could lead right back to you... All of it!
fi... - No, Michael. You listen.
I tried to teach you not to play with fire when you were little.
apparently, I failed.
I don't have much choice. What else can I do?
you can make sure your friends are not in danger, or maybe even put them first.
okay.
take a look at your stand-in.
he wouldn't pass for you in person, but he did a pretty good job on tape.
he's an organ donor. He has no criminal record.
I'm sure he didn't even know what he was involved in.
I want to know what you're gonna do to him.
so, you found the fake Michael Westen, huh? That's great, buddy.
Yeah, Fi and my Mom tracked him down, and I tailed him here.
name's Jacob Starky.
jacob
I told Pearce the tapes were a dead end.
we got a little breathing room for the moment.
good-looking fella.
doesn't quite have your chin, though.
that means a lot coming from you.
wait. Here we go.
that looks shady.
okay, that looks very shady.
so, our new pal Jacob is buying a Glock, Mikey.
what do you think he needs a gun for?
I don't know, but it looks like things are about to get interesting.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice.
you're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - should we shoot them?
an old friend who's informing on you to the fbi...
you know spies -- A bunch of bitchy little girls...
family, too... - Is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
what do you think of these shoes, Michael?
fantastic.
I have just the right dress.
are they real?
well, they look real. Isn't that what counts?
you're getting a fake identity, Michael.
I can't get fake shoes?
the place is up here somewhere.
you know, you go ahead. I'm gonna
Oh, that's pretty.
a fake identity is known in the spy trade as a false flag.
it used to be you could make your own documents with a printer and a laminator.
these days, though, I.D.s have magnetic strips, holograms, and infrared watermarks,you need a pro.
Yes. What can I do for you?
I lost my passport and driver's license.
I heard I could get some new ones here.
all you got to do is reporting them stolen.
they'll send you replacements.
right, but the thing is, I'm going on a trip soon, and I hear you could do it here more quickly and more quietly.
that might be possible...for a fee.
the fee is not an issue.
come on back.
I don't get much call for the good stuff anymore.
most of my business is just teenagers are trying to get past a bouncer at the titty bar.
titty bar.
they got no appreciation for art, you know?
give me your right hand.
how about pulling your sleeve back?
if this stuff gets on your shirt, it'll never come out.
and slide these on for me, if you don't mind.
this is you, isn't it?
uh, kind of hard to tell from here.
put those on for me, if you don't mind.
in some situations, a tactical retreat is your best option.
listen, well, I'm sorry as I can be about this.
but a guy like me don't stay in business very long unless he slips the FBI a boneevery now and then.
and let's face it --you're a big old soup bone.
flattered.
they come through every now and then ask about you.
a guy with a gun is a guy with a gun.
you can fight him and risk someone getting shot or wait for backup.
you're gonna be my get-no-hassles-for-a-year card.
Yeah, special agent Allerot.
Yeah, tell him it's Jumbo.
well, how many Jumbos you think he knows?
Mike, look at the deal I got on these shoes.
you're not gonna believe it.
lady!
lady, you can't be back here.
get out of here.
get out of here now.
sorry, I just wanted to show my boyfriend -- - get out of here now.
she's pregnant.
pregnant? - It worked.
where are you going?
my shoes.
they clashed with my dress anyway.
you know, I was thinking...
we could do some vacation-y things when we go to D. C.You know?
make the most of our trip.
Where's my lockpicks at?
you know, maybe a fancy dinner one night, take in some of the sights.
I'm gonna confront a man who tried to have me killed.
it's not a weekend get away.
we can mix business with pleasure.
it was right here.
Fi, the thing about D. C.
is that you're going to need backup.
don't tell me you'd rather have sam.
we can't talk about this right now. - Why not?
because I have a hard time focusing when I'm in handcuffs.
would this help?
another fine illustration of your need for tactical assistance.
admit it, Michael.
you need me.
you don't even have your own hairpin.
I do now.
you happy?
well, yeah, I know a few guys who do I. D. work, Mike.
but, you know, the feds are gonna be all over them, too, especially now.
feel them out for me, will you?
Mike, they said if you leave Miami, they're gonna pick you up.
in D. C.There's gonna be someone there who is gonna recognize you.
the best fake I. D. In the world isn't gonna change that.
the guy that burned me tried to have me killed.
as long as I'm in Miami, he can find me.
I'll take my chances in D. C.
you know who might be able to help is lucy.
she called a while back with a job, but you were pretty busy with this whole burn-notice business, you know.
what's the job?
well, I don't know the details, but I do know that she works with some real artistes.
these are the guys who can give you a whole new life to go with your I. D.
you interested?
let's give her a call.
corporations need spies just like governments do.
of course, they're not called spies.
they're called security consultants.
they're basically mercenaries with nice suits.
Lucy SECURITY CONSULTANT
your offices just keep getting better and better.
it's good to see you, Michael.
what have you been up to?
a little of this, a little of that.
haven't you been getting your reports from your FBI buddies?
I didn't tell them anything they couldn't find out for themselves.
if you tell them, they don't have to find out for themselves, do they?
uh, I...
you were the one that trained me in the delicate art of giving people useless information.
I said nice things, for what it's worth.
thank you.
you have a job for me?
a woman I met, Evelyn.
she heard I work security.
she asked me for help.
I guess her ex-husband ran off with their son.
we ran checks, credit cards, airlines, got nothing.
somebody's gonna have to do some legwork.
but a job that small is not really our thing.
you thought of me?
I would consider it a favor if you took the job.
and the money's not bad.
money's not the pressing issue.
Why? What do you need?
identity.
not for traveling?
Michael, if you leave Miami, I can't help you with that kind of thing.
seriously.
fine.
get your documents together.
I'll have my guys do an I. D. package.
go see Evelyn first.
Thanks.
I separated from Douga few months ago.
I tried to keep it together for Jasper's sake.
that's our son.
Evelyn THE CLIENT
but it was hard on him listening to us fight all the time.
he started acting up at school, and then Doug turned on him, and I wasn't gonna let that happen.
I'm sure you made the right decision.
he took him.
he picked him up early at school one day, and he disappeared.
did you call the police?
Yeah, every day.
but technically we're still married, and he's Jasper's father.
so without a custody order, I can't do anything.
please, I cannot wait for the courts to sort this out.
do you have any idea where he might have taken him?
none.
I have no idea, because I've hardly spoken to him in months.
do you have pictures?
Yeah.
here, that's jasper.
please. Lucy said you could find him.
I need to know that he's okay.
I want him back.
I'm gonna find him.
one of the things you learn in training is to avoid situations that cut too close.
if you had a rough childhood, a situation with an abusive father and a vulnerable kid is gonna make you angry.
that can be motivating, but it can also be dangerous.
well, she's a looker.
what's the story?
husband ran off with her kid.
you all right, Mike?
I'm gonna find this guy.
facts are the hallmark of a good false identity.
it's harder to create history than it is to alter it.
Plus, the more truth to your lie, the easier it is to remember.
I don't see you for weeks, and you start going through the closets?
what are you looking for?
where is that box you used to keep all my stuff in?
the memory box?
sounds about right.
I don't remember.
I'm kidding.
excuse me.
Oh, god, look, huh?
first place.
God, the trophy was bigger than you were.
could we speed this up, ma?
I need my medical records and my birth certificate.
all right.
Oh, how aboutyour report card, huh?
you could have been valedictorian if you hadn't been suspended so many times for getting into fights.
mom, I don't need my report card.
your father used to ge tso angry.
I don't want to talkabout dad, ma.
I just need my stuff.
fine, here.
I don't want you to think you're keeping those.
no, I'm just gonna make copies.
I'm gonna take a trip --work.
the last time you said that, you left for 10 years, Michael.
it's not that kind.
did you ever think about leaving, mom?
what?
did it ever get bad enough with dad that you thought about leaving?
of course I did.
I wanted to keep the family together, Michael, though the good and the bad.
you kids were so cute.
well, it's like lucy said.
chances are, he's probably still in the area.
there's no recent credit-card activity, no car rentals.
the only blip, Mike, is where he works
greenway Worldwide Cargo off of 57th.
I talked to my ATF buddy.
there's some kind of investigation there, some link to organized crime.
great.
u. S. Attorney's office is all over it.
I left a message, haven't heard back, and that's about it.
I should go talk to Evelyn.
you just talked to her, mike.
Yeah, but she was a little flustered the last time.
she might have forgotten something.
I thought you had to get those documents to Lucy for your fake I. D.
Yeah, I'll do it later.
something I should know, sam?
about what, FI?
about why Michael's acting this way.
what way? He seems fine to me.
tell me about this new client.
you know, I just remembered.
I've got to get Mike some yogurt, 'cause if I don't do that, boy, you know how he is.
he never mentioned trouble at work.
do you think there could be a connection? - Could be.
you hear ATF investigation, it raises flags.
I wish I could be more helpful.
sorry.
I think you should just focus on getting your son back.
that's the best way to deal with it.
Evelyn, I think you're stronger than you realize.
then maybe I should have just stuck with it.
you know, what would have happened if I had pretended that everything was all right?
but I didn't want my family to be a lie, not for Jasper and not for me.
you're doing the best thing.
believe me, I know a little something about this.
I've stayed, and I've left.
sometimes leaving is what you have to do.
it must be lonely, what you do.
I couldn't live that way.
in my line of work, I can't allow myself to get too close.
what if you met someone...
and there's a spark
would you ignore it?
could you?
I would, uh...
concentrate on getting the job done.
I got to head over to Doug's.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
okay.
what's taking so long, Sam?
are you losing your touch?
I didn't know Doug would have a nine-pin dimple lock.
you know, the new kind, the kind I haven't practiced on.
okay, my fingersare bleeding now.
there's some pain involved.
you know, this is the only place around here with bars on its windows.
I wonder what Doug was so worried about.
come on, baby.
there better be something good in here.
there we go.
got it.
looks like he didn't leave much.
I've worked with less.
check for bills.
bunch of junk mail, magazines.
hello.
Hey, here's a quiz.
it tells you how to pick your mate based on what you eat.
okay, Mike, what's your favorite meat?
pleasure reading later, Sam.
Oh, you're no fun.
Mike, two guys with guns are coming fast.
they must have been watching the house.
they've got the back covered.
Aah, nothing.
just because there are no windows or doors doesn't mean there are no exits.
the thing to look for is an air-conditioner unit.
that's where the wall is weakest.
also, people watch doors, they don't watch air conditioners.
Oh, the damsel in distress.
she said it was an emergency.
what do you want me to do?
be her knight in shining armor, of course.
Evelyn, this is Fiona. We work together.
Fiona, thank you. - Pleasure.
Evelyn. What happened?
I went to the courthouse to try to get an emergency custody hearing.
some guys were at my car.
they knocked me down.
how many men were there?
two, I think.
you think?
could there have been more?
probably the same guys that came by Doug's place.
Michael, if Jasper's caught up in the middle of this, I will never forgive myself.
please, you've gotto bring him home.
it's all right now.
it's okay.
I'm sorry.
it's all right.
it's okay.
what happened to the trade mark of Westen's emotional distance?
she was upset. - Obviously.
Where's your head at?
Fi, if you're gonna help me, you can't have this attitude.
attitude?
if you're gonna be like this, I think I'm entitled.
maybe I should do this one alone, then. - Maybe you should.
I'll drive you home. - I'll get there myself.
okay, Mike.
tell me I'm a genius.
you're a genius.
come on, you can do better than that.
remember the mail we were sorting at Doug's place
outdoor life, field & stream.
it got me thinking.
outdoor types always go back to the woods.
so I got a hold of a buddy of mine. He's at the coast guard.
he knows a guy in park service. - Just tell me, Sam.
state parks has a record of Doug's license plate at Mangrove Campground.
keys? - Yeah.
I'd go there with you, but Veronica is sort of setting up a mini vacation in Boca
one of those swimming-with-the-dolphins
I'll take care of it, sam.
I can't believe that you found him so quickly.
that's amazing.
my friend Sam may have bruised a couple of federal statutes along the way, but nothing a bottle of tequila can't smooth over.
well, he won't get in trouble?
we found him. That's what's important.
I knew I could count on you.
is that loaded? - Yeah
you're not gonna bring that when you go get Jasper, right?
it'll be fine.
trust me.
this is it?
what do we do now?
I don't want anybody getting hurt.
no matter what you see, stay in the car until I say.
okay.
thank you.
Where's your son?
Where's jasper?
look, this is about me.
I'll do whatever you want.
just don't go after my son.
you people killed my wife.
isn't that enough?
the basic rule of covert ops is let someone else do your dirty work.
let someone else find the guy you want to kill.
it's a great technique as long as you're not the someone else.
Evelyn THE ASSASSIN
move! Move!
Doug THE NEW CLIENT
Where's your son?
what, you come here to kill me -- - I'm not here to kill you.
that woman out there is.
who's she?
I need you to stay away from the windows.
where is your son?
he's not here.
I sent him to stay with friends.
that is one thingthat has gone right today.
my name is Michael, and I'm here to help you.
everything all right in there, Michael?
what is she doing?
she'll wait for us to make a move and pick us off when we do.
I need a screwdriver.
shouldn't we callthe park rangers?
unless the park rangersvhave been issued body armorand high-caliber weapons, we're on our own here.
she must have disabled my gunvwhen we stopped for gas.
remove the trigger-bar spring from a Sig Sauer p228, and you've got a 9-millimeter semiautomatic doorstop.
I don't know what you think you're playing at, but this is not a game you can win.
Doug, I need a paper clip.
do you have one?
I don't have a paper clip.
well, do you have somethinglike a paper clip -- A thin piece of metal -
wait.
never mind.
kill him yourself, if you want.
we need to wrap this thing up.
you fixed it? - Hardly.
I might get one shot off.
you have one chance to shoot her?
I'm not gonna shoot her.
wait.
is she leaving?
I seriously doubt that.
do you have any duct tape?
hold that there.
when I say,"now,"you're gonna open that door.
now!
shoot a propane tank, and you'll just get a big pot of cold gas.
you need an open flame and real good aim.
get down!
Yeah, Sam, I had to drive around, make sure we weren't followed.
she could be anywhere now.
got to go.
what's happening?
we'll get to that.
I need to know why someone wants you dead.
it's a long story.
well, it's a long story that starts with Greenway Cargo, right?
give me the short version for now.
I was the controller -- mostly wrote checks, did invoices.
it was a job.
I've been a CPA for 15 years.
need to get to the marked-for-death part.
after a while, I realized I was paying vendors I had never heard of for cargo that was never delivered.
front companies?
they were into all kinds of stuff-- weapons, ivory, human cargo.
that's what the FBI said.
anyway, they came to my house, said they were investigating the company, investigating me.
unless you testify?
I didn't want to get involved, but they said I'd go to jail.
I said I'd think about it.
then things started happening.
things? What things?
I had people following me, phone calls, guys watching my house.
then my wife...
went out in my car.
they said it was an accident, but I sent Jasper away, and I ran.
who are they?
they're your new best friends.
stay here.
ha, well, what a pieceof work she is.
so Evelyn used you to do the grunt work to track him down.
she shows up and finishes the job.
and when she kills him, everyone comes looking for you.
she seemed so nice.
Mike, she went through Lucyto get to you.
Yeah, call lucy. Evelyn's not the type to leave loose ends.
right.
Oh, almost forgot, that's for you.
Evelyn has the charger?
Yeah, it's gonna need some work.
and your gun?
removed the trigger-bar spring.
Oh, that sounds like something you would do.
you guys do really have a lot in common, don't you?
look, fi, I know you're enjoying this.
but now's not the time to say "I told you so."
this isn't like you, Michael.
I know.
Fiona, I need your help.
Oh, so you're not gonna handle this one on your own.
you just couldn't help yourself, could you?
sadly, no.
take Doug back to the loft. Lock him down tight.
you can handle that, right?
have I everlet you down?
be careful, FI.
don't worry, Michael. I never let my guard down.
what the hell do you mean you can't get ahold of her?
she doesn't have some kind of a -
Yeah, all right, well, keep trying.
Mike, she's in some kind of a meeting with a new client that just called this morning.
I mean, it might be nothing.
it's not gonna be nothing, Sam.
Hello?
Michael, if I had known you were this much fun to work with,
I would have come to Miami sooner.
I'm glad one of usis having fun.
you're not missing the damsel in distress, are you?
Michael, my son! I'm afraid! Please, Michael!
you changed.
this is more my style.
Oh, for crying out loud, I'm not gonna shoot you here.
besides, I need you.
you're the one who's going to tell me where Doug is.
Oh, here.
your car is in the campground parking lot.
what are we gonna do to resolve our problem?
well, I think our problems are a little different, but, yes, let's resolve them.
you know, you and I have a very special connection.
I'm not even sure who I'm talking to.
Oh, we met, in a manner of speaking-- Istanbul about six years ago.
july, seven years ago -- You took out those two diplomats.
Yes.
you know how close you came to catching me?
now, that was impressive.
and ever since then, I've kept tabs on you.
you might say I've become a fan.
I heard you got burned and got this gig in miami.
so the stars just kind of lining up.
I like the new look.
and your bruise, it healed.
Yeah, well, that was temporary.
I've been studying upon you.
it's not easy with someone as secretive as you are.
but, of course, things got a lot easier when you got burned.
you're not classified material anymore.
lucky you.
cause I learned something about your early years.
your daddy was mean, hmm?
so I figured an abusive husband and a troubled but gifted son -
well, that would bemotivating.
enough about me --let's talk about you.
no, I don't feel like it.
you know, I don't think that we should waste all your hard work.
what say we split the fee?
you just tell me where he is. I will do all the rest.
it's easy money.
Evelyn, I appreciate allt he effort you've put into this, but there comes a time where you have to walk away.
come on.
isn't there something I can do to persuade you?
there's nothing you can do.
you know what I love about Miami?
apart from you, of course.
the cheap labor.
you know, I can get a kid off the street to do a hit for about a grand.
well, if I flirt with him a little.
say, now, isn't that lucy?
Michael, I am so sorry.
it's not your fault.
Yes, it is.
you taught me better than that.
I'm so stupid. I should have been more thorough.
I've got guys headed to her hotel right now.
it won't matter.
I know. I just feel like I should do something.
you should.
you should be careful because she's still out there.
right on time.
yeah?
change your mind?
enough of this.
you want a deal, you deal with me.
you leave lucy out of it.
done.
Lucy has no more to fear from me.
you see, I can be reasonable.
of course, I still have a job to do.
and the next target will have to be Sam or Fiona or...
or -- I know --mommy.
sooner or later, I'll find someone you care about more than Doug.
so you call me when you want it to stop.
she's not leaving town, is she?
that would be a no.
if she knows all this about you, she'll probably come here.
she won't play this out on my turf.
she'll keep the pressure on until she gets an opening.
I can't believe this.
I'm a CPA, for christ's sake.
a CPA brought down Al Capone.
there's a reason why the feds want you to testify.
I say we hunt her down.
Ammunition's cheap.
Fi, if we go out there without a plan, we're exposed.
she's more than happy to keep killing people until we hand Doug over.
she can come after me. I'm ready.
yeah?
what about sam?
I'm game, Mike.
what about if she comes after my mom?
my brother?
Doug's son, Jasper?
so we just sit here and wait?
for once, she's right, Mike.
we've gotto do something.
we're gonna hand him over to the U. S. Attorney, get him into witness protection.
won't she still come after you?
we'll deal with that later.
Sam, I need you to callthe U. S. Attorney.
tell them we're bringing Doug in tomorrow morning.
I'm on it.
and somebody needs to go to my mom, see that she's safe, make her house secure.
you think she's cooked dinner yet?
I'm sure she'll heat something up for you, Sam.
well, then, I'm on that, too.
Fi, I need you to prepare an armed escort.
Doug, I need you to stay awayfrom the windows.
you say this isjust a precaution?
Oh, yeah, it's nothing to worry about.
um, say, this is a little embarrassing, but me and my lady friend had a falling out.
and, well, like, Mike thought maybe it would be okay if I crashed herefor the night.
Sam, I'm not an idiot.
you want to tell me what's going on?
well, see, there was this lady, and she was making some threats.
against me?
not specifically -- I mean, your name came up, but it was more like a hypothetical-type thing, so it's nothing to worry about.
but Mike wanted me to stay here and give you someself-defense pointers in case I had to leave.
you gonna leave this here when you go?
okay, be careful, okay, because that's loaded.
Yeah.
Michael's father had a Winchester single-shot.
I think I may still have it.
so, you want a beer?
you kidding?
Doug is sleeping peacefully.
you gave him something. - Maybe.
well, half of something.
Sam got in touch with his buddy at the U. S. Attorney's.
we're bringing Doug intomorrow morning.
great.
we can talk, finally.
there's nothing to talk about.
you were right. I was wrong. I'm sorry.
it isn't that simple, Michael.
you think you can let the job be who you are -- all you are -- and you can'T.
it's dangerous to think that you can.
I knowI can be...passionate, but I'm good at what I do.
I know.
it's no secret that things between us have been -- - a little rocky.
it isn't easy for me, either.
Evelyn comes along, and she's attractive, sweet, needy.
don't deny it, Michael.
fine.
isn't it interesting that she turned out to be...
who she turned out to be?
what shall we make of that?
you made your point, FI. - Did I?
Yep, you did.
what about D. C?
you still going?
I have to.
if I don't, it won't be long before Cowan sends someone else down here to kill me.
I need him to know that I can get to him, too.
and I need him to know that right now.
and you need help, and you know it.
I don't think that's a good idea.
is that a tactical judgment or a personal one?
both -- everybody I know is in danger right now, everyone I'm close to.
well...I'm willing to risk it...if you are.
how's my mom?
locked up cozy with a cigarette and a shotgun, ready to kill anything that comes through the door.
here you go, Doug, my lucky vest.
it will look great over my shirt. - Thanks
it's a little worn, but it will do the trick.
are these bullet holes?
Yeah, I broke it in for you.
it's a short ridet o the U. S. Attorney's office.
just think of it as a precaution, like a seat belt.
a seat belt that smells like old spice and bourbon.
easy, now.
assassination is 1% shooting, 99% preparation
anticipating moves, devising approaches, recruiting sources, finding the perfect opportunity so the bullet's almost an afterthought.
usually, that's when a target is on the move -
when there are too many variables to control them all.
we should get out of here.
Michael, whatever happens, thank you.
Yeah, you can thank me by keeping your head down and staying away from windows, okay?
there are ways to lessen the risk...an armed escort, taking an unpredictable route to your destination, having backup in a trail car.
but ultimately, as long as the assassin knows where you're going, they have the upper hand.
the point is the thing works.
it's one of the few things in my life that's never let me down.
it's impossible to stop a good assassin from finding an opening and taking a shot.
the best you can do is control where the best opening is.
and sometimes, that's enough.
drop it.
you set me up.
Bravo.
put it down, evelyn.
Hey, I can still do this.
did I tell you how much this job pays?
you could buy someplace decent to live, even at Miami prices.
put the rifle down.
how did you know I'd be here?
I figured you had a source in the U. S. Attorney's office.
you knew Doug was thinking about testifying.
I count six different vantage points with a better view of that entrance.
how did you knowI'd be at this one?
istanbul wasn't that long ago.
you like rooftops over windows.
you like angles with the target on your right-hand side because you're left-handed.
that's right.
I knew I liked you.
put it on.
Michael, is this what you really want? Huh?
helping out civilians with their little problems, trying to get your government job back?
pathetic.
you're better than that.
let's go.
we have a big day ahead of us. I've got to turn you in.
there will be questions.
it will be past lunch before we're done.
turn me in.
a lot of secrets, a lot of enemies -
I think it would be a short stay, don't you?
now, don't you think we couldcome to an arrangement?
I don't think so.
now, be honest with me.
if circumstance swere different...
do you think that we could...
not in this lifetime.
maybe the next one, then.
the indictments came down yesterday.
that was quick.
they found a leak in the U. S. Attorney's office, and Evelyn, wow -
they're gonna be working up her files for years.
she was a very, very bad girl.
I managed to keep you out of it so far.
it's gonna take some work.
I appreciate that, lucy.
don't say I never did anything for you.
I never would.
did she say anything before...
she wished that things had turned out...differently.
tell me about Doug and Jasper.
on their way to a new life in an undisclosed location.
he's gonna have to come back for trial.
he wanted you to have that.
and I have another present for you.
it's your new identity.
it should get you to D. C.or wherever.
thank you, lucy.
it's the least I could do -
and your car, whatever it costs to repair, I want to reimburse you.
don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna be in Miami that much longer.
will I see you again?
maybe.
so, is that your new I. D? - Yep.
I could get into the white house press room with these documents.
I don't thinkyou're gonna need it.
why is that?
I just got a call from a buddy.
one of the guys I asked to keep an eye out on this burn-notice business told me you might want to rethink your trip to D. C.
Why? What did he say?
the guy who burned you -
it turns out you don't need to go up there to see him because...
well, he's comingdown here to see you.
see me?
what does that mean? - I don't know.
just a heads-up.
well, it looks like I'm gonna have to get the charger fixed after all.
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies --a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
why go back to work for the people who've put you through all this?
I want to clear my name. I want to knowwho did this to me.
you think I burned you?
I know you did.
you're on the edge of something much, much bigger than us, my friend.
people I work for --they have plans for you.
Nate, I need you to pick me up.
fi and Sam are on a job dealing with some heroin dealers.
out of the car!
they took sam.
Yeah, th was pretty painful. How was that for you?
uh, Mike, it's for you. - Yello?
come out, come out, wherever you are.
Nate, I'm gonna pull over and get out.
you said they were following us. - Yeah, they want me.
when I get out, you go.
you don't stop for anything, you got it?
I have a job to do. I need 12 hours.
if you even come near me before that, I will put a bullet in my head.
woman: I believe we have a deal.
at least this time we get to say goodbye.
thank you, Fi.
time to get some questions answered.
burn notice, huh?
we need to talk, Michael. We've been trying to bring you in.
we're so looking forward to meeting you.
as a spy, you get to spend a lot of time alone.
whether you're in an Indonesian prison, a cave in the Afghan mountains, or the back of a cargo truck, it comes with the job.
you're trained to make the most of it, plan your next move, go over your intel, review your training.
but when you've cleaned your gun 30 times and reviewed the pt tense of every verb in five languages, you start itching to make a move.
Hello?
Hello, Michael.
sounds like you're having quite a party out there.
indeed we are. And you're the guest of honor.
no need for that, Michael. The shooting's all over.
I hope you're not too disappointed.
you can see me? Oh, I wish I could see you.
I thought we were gonna meet.
we will. First some business.
Yeah, sweetie. I thought we were gonna discuss why you burned me.
we've had our eye on you for a while, Michael.
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.
no, you didn't.
why don't you call me "Carla"?
go over to the car.
we have something we want you to take care of for us.
a job.
don't call it a job. Call it a favor.
I assume it has to do with the guy you've got gift-wrapped and duct-taped.
his name is jimmy. He's someone elsewe asked for a favor.
see, he decided to skip town instead.
Oh, so this is youremployee-retention program.
you... could call it that.
he needs to go back to Miami and do as he's told.
you need to help him. - I do? And why is that?
we have his wife and daughter.
if you don't help, what happens to them?
Oh, and one more thing.
Jimmy called 911 when he saw our team.
you probably want to move along.
I do this and then we meet.
I keep my promises.
I'll see what I can do. Don't move.
Jimmy THE CLIENT
air bags are great for surviving crashes, but they make some evasive maneuvers tough.
gone are the days when you could run through a stand of trees without a face full of nylon.
of course, anything you used to do head-on, you can still do.
but it's a little hard on anyone who's stuffed in the trunk.
security measures can sometimes seem a little cruel.
just like parents sometimes twist their kid's arm yanking them out of a busy street, sometimes the safest thing isn't the most comfortable.
sorry about the trunk, but I had to keep you out of sight for a few counties until we got clear of the police.
Jimmy, what are you doing?
we don't have time for this! I'm here to help you!
now, the people who did this are putting the screws to me, too.
I don't want to be here any more than you do.
now, do you want your family back?
I'm gonna work on that. Can you be good?
we have a long drive back to Miami.
if you can be good, you get to ride up front.
Jimmy: A couple months ago, I got a call from this lady.
smokey voice, lots of attitude?
wait a minute. You know her?
not as well as I'd like.
anyway, she wanted me to break into this place where I did a job.
a job? What is it you do, Jimmy?
look, I-I'm -- I'm in computer systems, okay?
I-I did a gig about a year ago for this company called security associates.
security associates -- is that private military?
Yeah, sure, something like that. I don't know, okay?
they were -- they were corporate guys, but really scary.
and the lady on the phone, she told me I had to break into there, okay?
and get a memory dump off their hard drive and get it back to her.
what did you say?
I said she was freakin' insane! I'm a computer tech, man.
I'm not -- I'm not a break-in guy.
so I was like, "no way!
and this led to you being hog-tied on an airstrip.
the lady on the phone threatened my family, so we decided to bail.
we hired this guy with a private plane, and then we went upstate.
and we were about to leave, and these guys with guns -- they came out of this helicopter.
and then they just -- They took my wife and my kid.
please, I don't even know who you are, but you got to help me.
we'll figure something out.
Mike, easy.
just me and a couple of slicesof wonder bread.
Hey, you okay?
I got to say, I didn't expect you back.
Yeah, I didn't expect to be back, either.
making yourself comfortable, I see.
uh, comfortable? I wouldn't go that far.
Mike, how do you fit into these little shirts? They're like doll clothes.
anyway, after you got me out of the boat, I didn't want to scare Veronica, you know, with all this, so I thought I'd lay low at your place for a while.
wait a minute. What happened with the big meeting?
it didn't go as well as I'd hoped.
it seems the people that burned me want me for a job.
for now, that's all I got. - A job? Does it pay?
more of a "we'll kill you if you don't do it" type of thing.
Ah, never liked those.
so, what is it?
help some computer tech steal some data.
I figure if I find out what they want stolen, I might get an idea of who they are.
the guy's outsidein the, uh, in the Caddy.
the caddy. You brought back the Caddy.
Oh, Mike, that's great.
I was afraid to ask, you know, 'cause veronica, she was gettingon my case, and I...
Yeah, about that --it's gonna need a little work.
so we're safe here?
uh, safe would be a stretch, but let's just say we could do worse.
okay, well, I need my phone,'cause I have to call
uh, no, Jimmy, you don't need your phone.
you called 911 on a double homicide.
the police are now tracking it.
you just need to go on in and clean yourself up.
go ahead.
Hey, Fi.
I can't believe you, Michael.
48 hours ago, we said goodbye --possibly forever.
and then I get a message from you on my cell that I should come right over because you got a job.
Fi, there's a lot going on, so...
you couldn't start with "I'm alive"?
I thought the fact that I was calling covered that.
that's not the point.
Fi, I called you because I need your help.
sorry. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hello.
Yeah, mom, I'm fine. I told you not to make calls on that phone.
well, I know that, but I'm stuck in a motel in Fort Lauderdale.
and I've been worried sick.
and if the phone's being bugged by those spy people, I guess now they know it, too.
I'm worried about my son.
besides, calls from a motel phone cost a dollar.
Oh, that's terrible.
so, when can I start making calls again?
just come on home. You can make all the calls you want.
what about those men with the guns? Are you okay?
Yeah, more or less. - I'm so glad.
I'm glad too, mom. - Bye, Michael.
you hadn't called your mom yet?
I was going... to wait a bit.
thanks for coming, Fi.
so, this womanon the phone -- did you ever see herin person?
did she give you a name, anything?
no, I told you, I never met her.
I mean, she said her name was Carla. That was it.
besides that, it was just, you know, "go steal the stuff for us or else.
okay, so, what is this data? What's on these computers that they want so badly?
I don't know. I mean, they don't pay me to look at the files.
they pay me to keep people from stealing them.
why do they even need us?
I mean, if they're blowing up a plane, they've got guys.
the people behind this, they don't want to get their hands dirty, so they get others to do their work for them like making us break into security associates.
I checked that place out.
guy who runs it is Ryder Stehl.
guy's been in all the hot spots, usually has corporate clients who want some heavy firepower.
basically any place where more guns equal more money, Mikey.
Yeah, that's the guy. Yeah.
I'm gonna need you to make an introduction.
talk to ryder? Face-to-face? No, no, no, no, no, no.
private security companies don't have a lot of walk-in business, Jimmy, so we're gonna needan introduction, and you're the bestwe've got.
if I'm gonna do this, I need to look at their security setup.
it'll be fine.
Sam and Fi will back us up if anything goes wrong, right?
uh, yeah, right. Right, we got you covered. Absolutely no problem.
yeah? - Yeah.
okay.
calm down. You'll be fine. - Right.
can we just go over it one more time? - Sure.
we go in, you introduce me, you leave.
private military companies are best known for their bodyguard work.
it's a big part of their business, but it's not the only part.
for a big enough check, they'll rain hot lead down wherever you want.
it's not work that attracts "service with a smile" types.
thanks for, um...
this is the guy that I told you about.
you wanted to talk to me?
Terry Millar. I heard a lot of great things about your operation.
ryder Stehl. Jimmy here tells me you're in mining.
my boy Jimmy here, he says that you're the folks to look for when we need a mercenary.
we're security consultants, not mercenaries.
AYDER STAHL MERCENRRY
right. I think what he meant was...
Oi! I can speak for myself, mate.
piss off, then. We've got business. - Okay.
you call yourself what you like.
I got serious business to be handled.
now can we go upstairs and talk in private?
I've got mining interests up around the northern border of Kenya.
locals are my problem.
I need 'em dealt with.
dealt with --"what does that mean?
you know what it means. Enough with the word games.
I'm willing to pay good money for a permanent solution to my problem.
Mr. Millar, you just solicited an illegal act, and my security tells me you've got a backup team sitting on the roof of the parking garage across the street.
are you a cop?
is this a joke?
no joke. Two-person team watching. We do regular security sweeps.
I don't know who these blokes are, but they're not backup.
I've got an operation that looks to prove out in the low nine figures.
I got enemies, mate.
so they're not yours. - Not mine.
I guess we'll just have to find out.
take him out the back.
Sam: You're being too hard on Mike.
you know, he damn near got himself killed saving me.
Yeah, and I damn near got myself killed saving the both of you.
and then he comes back and acts like nothing happened.
I'm just saying, I can count on one hand the number of buddies I got who would stage an armed assault to save my butt, okay?
you got Mike. You got...
when you're claiming to be someone you're not, the key is commitment.
you've got to sell it like your life depends on it.
because sometimes it does.
the point is, Mike is the kind of guy who's got your back.
gun!
one reason to work with the same people is you know each other's moves, so if you shoot at your team in the middle of an operation, they know to go with it.
what the hell is he doing?
I think we just got recruited into Michael's cover I. D.
get down! Get down!
it takes a good marksman to shoot you at 50 feet from a moving car.
but it takes a great marksman to miss while making it look like they're trying to hit you.
or "markswoman," as the case may be.
so, you're saying that that went well?
he doesn't think I'm a cop anymore.
it's true.
I got him backstopped with a job history, bank accounts, even got a British mining company to hire him as a contract or retroactively.
point is, Ryder's boys have been calling around, checking him out.
now we just go back to him, sell him on the deal, and check out his security layout.
listen, even if we pull this thing off, I'm the only guy that can get that data, and they know that, okay?
if we do this, I'm a dead man.
never let that happen, Jimmy.
one problem at a time.
that's easy for you to say.
yo, Jimbo. - What?
come on. Let's go upstairs, set you up with a beer, maybe a yogurt.
got this great card game we used to play back in the S.E.A.L. teams when we were feeling crappy.
I'll teach you. You're gonna love it.
Yeah, ma, you're back in town.
Madeline: Michael, you have to come over here now. It's a disaster.
on my way.
ma?
what are you doing? Put the shotgun down.
well, what am I supposed to do? There were men in suits with guns out there after me.
they were after me.
well, you're here, so maybe I should have a shotgun.
what's the disaster?
it's the coffee maker.
you had me rush out of here on such short notice, the damn thing burned out!
it blew a fuse in the kitchen, and it spoiled a fridge full of food.
this is the disaster?
a coffee maker built in 1967?
and the food. I've been cleaning for hours.
Oh, I found your phone -- in the glove compartment of the charger.
my phone in the charger?
well, I assumed it was one of yours.
you go through those things like toothpicks.
car's in the garage.
excuse me a sec, mom.
hello there, Michael. Good to hear from you.
glad I could brighten your day.
looks like you owe my mom a new coffee maker.
care to tell me why you're breaking into her house?
just letting you know we can.
I'd like to remind you that there's a clock on this operation of ours.
I want you to speak to someone.
daddy?
no, it's not your daddy. I'm a friend of your dad's.
can I talk to him?
he's not here right now, but he wants me to tell you that he misses you.
I don't like it here. When is he coming?
can you tell mewhere you are?
Carla: No, she can't.
leave her alone.
you're not really gonna hurt a little girl.
maybe. Maybe not.
if I get what I want, you don't need to find out.
they said you weren't in, so I waited.
you got a lot of balls coming here.
it seems to me if anyone should be upset, mate, it's me.
I'm the onewho got shot at. I'm the one who needsa job done.
if you're not interested, I'll leave Miami.
if you are interested, we talk now.
come on. Let's try it again.
every thief knows that the best way to scout a place you want to rob is as a customer.
who gets to see the vault at the local bank?
the rich guy with something to protect.
who gets to see the security at a private military company?
a guy who wants to start his own little war.
there's unoxidized kimberlite in this region here.
it's called blue ground.
it means diamonds.
my problem is the village.
we can handle the problem area.
eliminate the civilians and burn it -- you'll never know it was there.
let's get to the details and the deal.
not so fast, mate.
there's a hundred mil U. S.
people'd kill for this deal, not just those people from the other day.
I need to know my information is secure.
building security is 24-7.
we have biometric security in all the key areas.
key-card access throughout the building.
a great way to get people talking about their security is to put them on the defensive.
accuse a guy of having bad locks, and before you know it, he's telling you where his motion detectors are.
right. That's a nice toy.
but what about this door?
Hollow-core veneer. You can cut through that with a handsaw.
that may be, but what do you do then?
the door's alarmed.
building security is here in under a minute, police under five.
here, the computeris kept in a sealed room with a burn vault.
someone breaks in, it melts the drives to slag.
it takes some practice, but counting your steps can be extremely useful if you need to reproduce a floor plan from memory.
not bad. Could be better.
I'll come back Tuesday. We'll talk terms.
once you've memorized the floor plan, you want to get it down on paper as quickly as you can.
combine that with the technical specs of the security devices in the room, and you'll know where the holes in the security are.
then it's just a matter of slipping through one of those holes.
Sam: That is a terrible 2. So let's do the math.
how many 2s in a deck? - Four.
right. So those are your cardsyou can play -- 2s or 4s.
or, 2 plus 4 is what?
6 - 6.You can play an 8. 2 times 4 is what?
8 - 8. You can play a 4, an 8, a 2...
uh, I appreciate you trying to distract him, but could you take it outside?
sure. Come on, Jimbo.
let's go out on the balcony, get some fresh air so you can concentrate.
figuring out a time when we can have our conversation?
Fi, I'm planning a heist.
um, c-can you just --I mean, I-I got to do the job first. Right.！
so, what can I do for the job?
I need you to get us into ISO-Gene labs.
it's a DNA-Testing facility one floor above security associates.
I need to get in there for an hour at night alone, and we're gonna be making a lot of noise.
you have a high estimation of my skills, Michael.
you've earned every bit of it, Fi.
so, once I'm in, how do I get the data?
it's complicated. You have to, um, br
I have to come with you.
Jimmy... uh, I don't think this is your kind of operation.
I know. None of this is.
but those computers and hard drives are completely secure, okay?
I made them that way.
so to steal the data, we have to tap into the hardwiring in the wall.
and we'll only have one chanceto do that.
well, that's gonna be dangerous.
doesn't matter.
this is for my wife and my daughter.
get me in and I'll get the data.
hold on a sec.
what's the matter?
Oh, bum knee. I got to, you know, stretch it once in badly done surveillance -- that is, surveillance you notice -- can mean a lot of things.
some organizations need intelligence but can't afford to pay for training.
okay, okay!
some organizations just want you to know they're watching.
who are you? Who sent you?
I don't know. I answered an ad.
100 bucks to watch and take notes. Some woman.
she give you anything? - Yeah.
she told me not to open this.
I was wondering when you'd call.
Oh, that was some operative you sent.
a freelancer. I don't think he'll be answering newspaper ads for a while.
Jimmy got our message?
we thought you could usea little reminder of what's at stake here.
Yeah, we head in tonight. Is that soon enough?
that will be fine, thank you. - Now...
I need something from you.
what is that?
the guns your guys used to kill those men at the airstrip -- you have them?
they could probably be located. Whatever for?
I want them.
if I'm gonna work for you, I want tactical support.
I confess, I'm curious.
fine, you'll have your guns.
and Jimmy's family.
I will give you a date and location.
you will deliver them when and where I say.
of course, Michael. We want this to be a good experience for everyone.
cook...
I am so sorry.
we called as soon as we realized the problem.
apparently the engineer missed the defect in the architectural plans.
we're dealing with all the floors.
we'd start with security associates below you, but you're up first 'cause you've got all the heavy equipment.
well, lucky us.
I'm just glad you guys caught it before someone fell through he floor.
getting into a secure facility is as simple as giving yourself a good reason to be there.
here we are. - Uh, yeah.
it's so stiff. - I'll pull it out.
right here.
right here.
our guys will need a few hours.
the defect's in the beam, so they'll be cutting.
we just need you to notify the building and let the workers in.
the next morning, it will be like we were never here, and I'll be out of your hair.
Hey, you come back anytime you'd like.
they'll be by tonight.
please don't forget to call building security, or I will get into so much trouble.
we can't have that. I'll call now.
talk to our rep?
she told me you were coming, yes. - How about her, huh?
we're gonna be in the back lab over here.
we're gonna be making some noise.
should only take a couple of hours.
there's some B.S. about the chemicals we use.
now, you can come back, but it's got to be on your insurance.
I'm, uh... I'm fine here, thanks.
the typical floor is concrete slab over 20-gauge steel pan with steel trusses spaced 30 inches for support.
when you cut through a floor, the thing you have to worry about is wiring.
cut into the wrong wire, and you'll set off the building alarms, electrocute yourself, or both.
if you don't want a chunk of concrete crashing through to the floor below, you need to drill a hole and anchor the slab.
a concrete saw cuts it like butter.
if you've done your planning right, you'll be dropping into a blind spot for the security system, usually behind an interior wall.
motion detectors bounce sound off objects and analyze the reflection.
if something changes, the alarm goes off.
move slow enough, and a wool comforter absorbs enough sound to keep it from triggering.
a thermal blanket, meanwhile, shields your body from heat sensors.
how do you think he's doing in there?
it's Michael.
so, look, Fi...
I got to go back to Veronica, explain where I've been, why I'm all beat to hell, and what happened to the Caddy.
I'd pay to watch that.
Oh, come on. Fi, you're a girl. What do I say?
I'm your girl consultant now?
when did I sign up for that job?
okay, fine. Forget it. You know, I got lots of other friends with ovaries. I got you...
tell her you got beaten up defending a helpless man from a gang of ex lowlife soldiers.
it's true enough.
okay, so I'm the hero.
and the helpless man.
somebody's working late.
better let Mike know.
evening, Mr. Stehl.
Hey, Stevie. Thanks for the call.
so, what's going on?
it's, uh, probably nothing, but you said you wanted usto call you any time if something unusual was going on in the building.
ryder is back. - How long? - I don't know. It's supposed to be backing up now.
the data runs along the cable of the backup drives.
well, what's the problem? 'Cause we don't have time.
I set the backup for 11: 30. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
okay, it's coming, it's coming. It's coming.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes!
Oh, god. Oh, god.
okay, that's not good. - Give them a minute.
Oh, god, I'm so sorry. W-what do we do?
plan B.
quadrangle buckshot is a specialized round designed to destroy the inside of anything delicate.
a computer, for example.
get back!
take the rope and tie it off.
we're going out the window?
unless you want to wait around.
for hardened security glass, I prefer FRAG-12, a military round with an explosive projectile.
Ohh, I think I sprained my body.
Hey, you want another beer?
I'm telling you, did wonders for my ribs.
you're fine.
I just want my family back.
we're working on it. - Yeah, how?
those guys at security associates, they're gonna kill me as soon as they get a chance.
exactly, and that makes them predictable, and that's how we're gonna solve your problem.
Sam, can you get me a boat, something disposable?
disposable?
Oh, I see where you're going.
I know a guy.
Yeah. It's a decent boat, once upon a time.
it's got mold, but it doesn't sound like it's gonna be around long enough to bother us.
how is this gonna solve my problem?
these guys from security associates want to kill you.
we need to give them the opportunity to do just that.
trust me. The heat that's on you, everyone thinking that you're dead is gonna be the best thing that ever happened to you.
Michael, I got a delivery today.
someone was kind enough to break into the trunk of my car.
Yeah, what was it?
a present from your friends.
be careful with those, fi. They're very hot.
Oh, I'll take good care of them.
Michael, your mother keeps calling me.
these last few days have been a lot for her to handle.
I know the feeling.
go see her, Michael.
I got to go visit my mom.
Sam, get on that boat.
aye, aye, Skipper.
you might want to slow down, mom.
how, Michael? You tell me.
I'm not sleeping.
this business with the coffee maker.
this is about a coffee maker?
it isn't just that.
your brother's still up in Fort Lauderdale, you know.
I mean, he believes it's not safe here.
uh, Nate has disappeared for years before, mom.
he's been in fort Lauderdale for a few days.
what about me, Michael?
all these years, and finally I see what you do.
you tell me I have to leave town at a minute's notice.
I can't talk on the phone. We're being chased by men with guns!
how am I supposed to deal with this?
all these years, you wondered why I didn't come home, why I didn't call.
this is why, mom.
I never wanted this for you.
I'm sorry.
well, it still doesn't explain why you didn't write.
you want this big, right?
just enoughfor the boat, Fi.
try not to break all the windows in south beach.
Jimmy. Call Ryder.
are you sure?
y-you said the cops will be listening on this phone, so I...
and that's --that's the point.
we talked about this, and we practiced it, so if you could do that now.
okay.
security associates.
uh, I need --I need to speak to ryder. T-tell himthat it's Jimmy.
hold, please.
did a hell of a job in my office, kid.
do you really think you're gonna get away with this, huh?
do you have any idea who you just took on?
please, just listen, okay?
it was --it was the guy, the one -- the one that I introduced you to?
look, I want to make this right, okay?
if we can just meet, then I can explain everything.
I don't need explanations, Jimmy.
I need my data back.
I want to give it back to you.
that's good. Just tell me where you are.
once the cops pick up a call on a flagged cell, they triangulate its location.
from there, they organize and deploy units, a process that can take 10 minutes, give or take.
bad guys don't have that chain of command.
they can be anywhere as fast as their wheels can take them.
get in position. Stay out of sight. Going down to the boat.
what do we do if he comes out? Do you want us to pop him?
no, I need to figure out what the hell's going on first.
then you pop him.
get going.
you want to talk. We do it face-to-face.
so you coming out, or do I come down to the boat?
how do I know you're not armed?
I don't want to shoot you, Jimmy.
I just want to get my data back.
hold him off. Tell him to prove he's unarmed.
I don't believe you. Okay? Show me. Show me that you don't have a gun.
what do you want me to do? Here. Here. See?
unarmed.
I-I don't believe you.
Jimmy, I'm not messing around. I'm coming down.
no, wait. Okay, just wait a second. Wait.
he's gonna figure this out. How much longerdo I have to do this?
if he finds out you're not on that boat before the ATF gets here, he will track you down.
he will go after you and your family for the rest of your life.
now, you will do this now. Do it.
stay back.
you don't want your data all over the internet, do you?
now don't take another step.
all right. All right.
take off your clothes --the jacket and the pants -- and then you can come.
I'm not taking my pants off.
I'm not messing around.
neither am I.
I lied, Jimmy.
want to see my gun?
here it is.
now, want to know what I'm gonna do to you if you don't come out right now?
Yeah. Tell me. Tell me what you're gonna do.
drop it and show me your hands.
on your stomach -- now!
get your butt off this deck. Let's go.
move!
nice hardware.
it's not mine. It's a setup.
put him in the truck.
it's going to be hard for them to explain why they have guns linked to a double homicide.
still, probably best to make sure no one ever knows you're alive.
and my family?
Sam has a friend who's gonna take you on a boat to Haiti tonight.
should be fine.
coast guard doesn't pay much attention to boats going to Haiti.
from there, you'll fly to Argentina and meet your family at the airport.
you really think they'll be there?
well, Carla needs me for other things.
if she doesn't keep her promises to you, she loses me as an asset.
man, I-I don't know how to thank you.
do you want my car? I mean, it's at my work. I don't really need it anymore.
it's a SAAB. Convertible.
Yeah. Love convertibles.
okay. There you go.
I got to leave the country, and you're stuck working for them.
I don't know who has it better.
you do, jimmy. Believe me. You do.
in intelligence gathering, too little information is obviously a problem, but too much information is just as bad in some ways.
500 files.
and every OP looks pretty nasty.
the question is, why does she want this stuff?
no clue, but it's a start.
time to talk.
I... I lost youthe other day.
I came back, Fi. - But you left...
Michael. You had a choice to make, and you made it.
I always thought maybe when it came down to it that...
but you didn't.
what are you saying, Fi?
that I'll always careabout you, Michael.
and I'll still help you with your thing, and you'll still help me with mine.
but we can't be together.
I know.
I said that for a long time.
Yes, you have.
when you work as a spy, it's easy to think of people as assets, resources to accomplish a goal...
because you don't have a personal relationship with an asset.
you don't care about an asset.
you don't miss the scent of an asset when she leaves the room.
I think 4 across is "beets.
that looks like a tough one. - A little.
but I'm getting through it.
well, if you need any help, I'm right over there.
I was just leaving, actually. Next time?
it's a good thing I'm patching things up with Veronica, cause if I wasn't, that's a real firecracker there.
Hey, what about you? You're a free man now that youand fi are, well, you know.
we weren't together, Sam. - Okay.
how'd it go with jimmy? - Great.
he gave a call. He's with his family. He's safe.
looks happy enough.
hold on a sec.
Hello? - Hello, Michael.
just wanted to call now that you're done with our little project.
see how that worked out?
he's happy. We're happy. You're happy.
we want to make this arrangement work.
or you'll kill me.
see? Now you're catching on.
Yeah, just one thing. You said we'd meet.
you promised, I believe.
but we did meet, Michael.
tell Sam thanks for the help with the crossword.
whoa, Mike. What's up?
enjoy THE PUZZLE. I'LL SEE YOU SOON.
I used to be a spy until...
man: we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing. No cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am i?
Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies --A bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
Fiona: why go back to wor for the people who've put you through all this?
I want to clear my name.
I want to know who did this to me.
you think I burned you?
I know you did.
you're on the edge of something much, much bigger than us, my friend.
people I work for -- They have plans for you.
Nate, I need you to pick me up.
fi and sam are on a job dealing with some heroin dealers.
out of the car!
Fiona: they took sam.
Yeah, that was pretty painful.
how was that for you?
uh, Mike, it's for you.
Yello?
woman: come out, come out, wherever you are.
Nate, I'm gonna pull over and get out.
you said they were following us.
Yeah, they want me.
when I get out, you go.
you don't stop for anything, you got it?
I have a job to do.
I need 12 hours.
if you even come near me before that, I will put a bullet in my head.
woman: I believe we have a deal.
at least this time we get to say goodbye.
thank you, Fi.
time to get some questions answered.
burn notice, huh?
we need to talk, Michael.
we've been trying to bring you in.
we're so looking forward to meeting you.
as a spy, you get to spend a lot of time alone.
whether you're in an Indonesian prison, a cave in the Afghan mountains, or the back of a cargo truck, it comes with the job.
you're trained to make the most of it, plan your next move, go over your intel, review your training.
but when you've cleaned your gun 30 times and reviewed the past tense of every verb in five languages, you start itching to make a move.
Hello?
Hello, Michael.
sounds like you're having quite a party out there.
indeed we are.
and you're the guest of honor.
no need for that, Michael.
the shooting's all over.
I hope you're not too disappointed.
you can see me?
Oh, I wish I could see you.
I thought we were gonna meet.
we will.
first some business.
Yeah, sweetie.
I thought we were gonna discuss why you burned me.
we've had our eye on you for a while, Michael.
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.
no, you didn't.
why don't you call me "Carla"?
go over to the car.
we have something we want you to take care of for us.
a job.
don't call it a job.
call it a favor.
I assume it has to do with the guy you've got gift-wrapped and duct-taped.
his name is Jimmy.
he's someone else we asked for a favor.
see, he decided to skip town instead.
Oh, so this is your employee-retention program.
You...could call it that.
he needs to go back to Miami and do as he's told.
you need to help him.
I do? And why is that?
we have his wife and daughter.
if you don't help, what happens to them?
Oh, and one more thing.
Jimmy called 911 when he saw our team.
you probably want to move along.
I do this and then we meet.
I keep my promises.
I'll see what I can do.
don't move.
air bags are great for surviving crashes, but they make some evasive maneuvers tough.
gone are the days when you could run through a stand of trees without a face full of nylon.
of course, anything you used to do head-on, you can still do.
but it's a little hard on anyone who's stuffed in the trunk.
security measures can sometimes seem a little cruel.
just like parents sometimes twist their kid's arm yanking them out of a busy street, sometimes the safest thing isn't the most comfortable.
sorry about the trunk, but I had to keep you out of sight for a few counties until we got clear of the police.
Jimmy, what are you doing?
we don't have time for this!
I'm here to help you!
now, the people who did this are putting the screws to me, too.
I don't want to be here any more than you do.
now, do you want your family back?
I'm gonna work on that.
can you be good?
we have a long drive back to Miami.
if you can be good, you get to ride up front.
Jimmy: a couple months ago, I got a call from this lady.
smokey voice, lots of attitude?
wait a minute. You know her?
not as well as I'd like.
anyway, she wanted me to break into this place where I did a job.
a job? What is it you do, jimmy?
look, I-i'm -- I'm in computer systems, okay?
I- I did a gig about a year ago for this company called Security Associates.
security Associates --Is that private military?
Yeah, sure, something like that. I don't know, okay?
they were -- They were corporate guys, but really scary.
and the lady on the phone, she told me I had to break into there, okay?
and get a memory dump off their hard drive and get it back to her.
what did you say?
I said she was freakin' insane!
I'm a computer tech, man.
I'm not -- I'm not a break-in guy.
so I was like, "no way!
and this led to you being hog-tied on an airstrip.
the lady on the phone threatened my family, so we decided to bail.
we hired this guy with a private plane, and then we went upstate.
and we were about to leave, and these guys with guns, they came out of this helicopter.
and then they just
they took my wife and my kid.
please, I don't even know who you are, but you got to help me.
we'll figure something out.
Mike, easy.
just me and a couple of slices of wonder bread.
Hey, you okay?
I got to say, I didn't expect you back.
Yeah, I didn't expect to be back, either
making yourself comfortable, I see.
uh, comfortable? I wouldn't go that far.
Mike, how do you fit into these little shirts?
they're like doll clothes.
anyway, after you got me out of the boat,
I didn't want to scare veronica, you know, with all this, so I thought I'd lay low at your place for a while.
wait a minute.
what happened with the big meeting?
it didn't go as well as I'd hoped.
it seems the people that burned me want me for a job.
for now, that's all I got.
a job? Does it pay?
more of a "we'll kill you if you don't do it" type of thing.
Ah, never liked those.
so, what is it?
help some computer tech steal some data.
I figure if I find out what they want stolen, I might get an idea of who they are.
the guy's outside in the, uh, in the Caddy.
the Caddy. You brought back the Caddy.
Oh, Mike, that's great.
I was afraid to ask, you know, 'cause veronica, she was getting on my case, and I...
Yeah, about that -- It's gonna need a little work.
so we're safe here?
uh, safe would be a stretch, but let's just say we could do worse.
okay, well, I need my phone, 'cause I have to call -- -Uh, no, Jimmy, you don't need your phone.
you called 911 on a double homicide.
the police are now tracking it.
you just need to go on in and clean yourself up.
go ahead.
Hey, Fi.
I can't believe you, michael.
48 hours ago, we said goodbye -- Possibly forever.
and then I get a message from you on my cell that I should come right over because you got a job.
Fi, there's a lot going on, so...
you couldn't start with "I'm alive"?
I thought the fact that I was calling covered that.
that's not the point.
Fi, I called you because I need your help.
sorry. Hold on.
hold on. Hold on. Hello.
Yeah, mom, I'm fine.
I told you not to make calls on that phone.
well, I know that, but I'm stuck in a motel in Fort Lauderdale.
and I've been worried sick.
and if the phone's being bugged by those spy people,
I guess now they know it, too.
I'm worried about my son.
besides, calls from a motel phone cost a dollar.
Oh, that's terrible.
so, when can I start making calls again?
just come on home.
you can make all the calls you want.
what about those men with the guns? Are you okay?
Yeah, more or less.
I'm so glad.
I'm glad too, mom.
Bye, michael.
you hadn't called your mom yet?
I was going...to wait a bit.
thanks for coming, Fi.
so, this woman on the phone.
did you ever see her in person?
did she give you a name, anything?
no, I told you, I never met her.
I mean, she said her name was Carla. That was it.
besides that, it was just, you know, "go steal the stuff for us or else.
okay, so, what is this data?
what's on these computers that they want so badly?
I don't know.
I mean, they don't pay me to look at the files.
they pay me to keep people from stealing them.
why do they even need us?
I mean, if they're blowing up a plane, they've got guys.
the people behind this, they don't want to get their hands dirty, so they get others to do their work for them, like making us break into Security Associates.
I checked that place out.
guy who runs it is Ryder Stehl.
guy's been in all the hot spots, usually has corporate clients who want some heavy firepower
basically any place where more guns equal more money, Mikey.
Yeah, that's the guy.
I'm gonna need you to make an introduction.
talk to Ryder? Face-to-face?
no, no, no, no, no, no.
private security companies don't have a lot of walk-in business, Jimmy, so we're gonna need an introduction, and you're the best we've got.
if I'm gonna do this, I need to look at their security setup.
it'll be fine.
Sam and Fi will back us up if anything goes wrong, right?
uh, yeah, right.
right, we got you covered.
absolutely no problem.
yeah? -Yeah.
OK.
calm down. You'll be fine.
right. Can we just go over it one more time?
sure. We go in, you introduce me, you leave.
private military companies are best known for their bodyguard work.
it's a big part of their business, but it's not the only part.
for a big enough check, they'll rain hot lead down wherever you want.
it's not work that attracts "service with a smile" types.
Hi. Thanks for, um...
this is the guy that I told you about.
you wanted to talk to me?
I heard a lot of great things about your operation.
Jimmy here tells me you're in mining.
my boy jimmy here, he says that you're the folks to look for when we need a mercenary.
we're security consultants, not mercenaries.
AYDER STAHL MERCENAAY
right. I think what he meant was...
Oi! I can speak for myself, mate.
piss off, then. We've got business.
okay.
you call yourself what you like.
I got serious business to be handled.
now can we go upstairs and talk in private?
I've got ming interests up around the northern border of kenya.
locals are my problem.
I need 'em dealt with.
dealt with -- " what does that mean?
you know what it means. Enough with the word games.
I'm willing to pay good money for a permanent solution to my problem.
Mr. Millar, you just solicited an illegal act, and my security tells me you've got a backup team sitting on the roof of the parking garage across the street.
are you a cop?
is this a joke?
no joke. Two-person team watching.
we do regular security sweeps.
I don't know who these blokes are, but they're not backup.
I've got an operation that looks to prove out in the low nine figures.
I got enemies, mate.
so they're not yours.
not mine.
I guess we'll just have to find out.
take him out the back.
you're being too hard on Mike.
you know, he damn near got himself killed saving me.
Yeah, and I damn near got myself killed saving the both of you.
and then he comes back and acts like nothing happened.
I'm just saying, I can count on one hand the number of buddies I got who would stage an armed assault to save my butt, okay?
you got Mike.
you got...
when you're claiming to be someone you're not, the key is commitment.
you've got to sell it like your life depends on it.
because sometimes it does.
the point is, Mike is the kind of guy who's got your back. Gun!
one reason to work with the same people is you know each other's moves, so if you shoot at your team in the middle of an operation, they know to go with it.
what the hell is he doing?
I think we just got recruited into Michael's cover I. D.
get down! Get down!
it takes a good marksman to shoot you at 50 feet from a moving car.
but it takes a great marksman to miss, while making it look like they're trying to hit you.
or "markswoman," as the case may be.
so, you're saying that that went well?
he doesn't think i'm a cop anymore.
it's true.
I got him backstopped with a job history, bank accounts, even got a British mining company to hire him as a contractor retroactively.
now we just go back to him, sell him on the deal, and check out his security layout.
listen, even if we pull this thing off, i'm the only guy that can get that data, and they know that, okay?
if we do this, I'm a dead man.
never let that happen, Jimmy.
one problem at a time.
that's easy for you to say.
yo, Jimbo. -What?
come on. Let's go upstairs, set you up with a beer, maybe a yogurt.
got this great card game we used to play back in the S.E.A.L Teams when we were feeling crappy.
I'll teach you. You're gonna love it.
Yeah, ma, you're back in town.
Michael, you have to come over here now.
it's a disaster.
on my way.
ma?
what are you doing? Put the shotgun down.
well, what am I supposed to do?
there were men in suits with guns out there after me.
they were after me.
well, you're here, so maybe I should have a shotgun.
what's the disaster?
it's the coffee maker.
you had me rush out of here on such short notice, the damn thing burned out!
it blew a fuse in the kitchen, and it spoiled a fridge full of food.
this is the disaster?
a coffee maker built in 1967?!
and the food.
I've been cleaning for hours.
Oh, I found your phone
in the glove compartment of the charger.
my phone in the charger?
well, I assumed it was one of yours.
you go through those things like toothpicks.
car's in the garage.
excuse me a sec, mom.
hello there, michael.
good to hear from you.
glad I could brighten your day.
looks like you owe my mom a new coffee maker.
care to tell me why you're breaking into her house?
just letting you know we can.
I'd like to remind you that there's a clock on this operation of ours.
I want you to speak to someone.
daddy?
no, it's not your daddy.
I'm a friend of your dad's.
can I talk to him?
he's not here right now, but he wants me to tell you that he misses you.
I don't like it here.
when is he coming?
can you tell me where you are?
no, she can't.
leave her alone.
you're not really gonna hurt a little girl.
maybe. Maybe not.
if I get what I want, you don't need to find out.
they said you weren't in, so I waited.
you got a lot of balls coming here.
it seems to me if anyone should be upset, mate, it's me.
I'm the one who got shot at.
I'm the one who needs a job done.
if you're not interested, I'll leave Miami.
if you are interested, we talk now.
come on.
let's try it again.
every thief knows that the best way to scout a place you want to rob is as a customer.
who gets to see the vault at the local bank?
the rich guy with something to protect.
who gets to see the security at a private military company?
a guy who wants to start his own little war.
there's unoxidized kimberlite in this region here.
it's called Blue Ground.
it means diamonds.
my problem is the village.
we can handle the problem area.
eliminate the civilians and burn it
you'll never know it was there.
let's get to the details and the deal.
not so fast, mate.
there's a hundred mil u. s.
people'd kill for this deal, not just those people from the other day.
I need to know my information is secure.
building security is 24-7.
we have biometric security in all the key areas.
key-card access throughout the building.
a great way to get people talking about their security is to put them on the defensive.
accuse a guy of having bad locks, and before you know it he's telling you where his motion detectors are.
right. That's a nice toy.
but what about this door?
Hollow-core veneer.
you can cut through that with a handsaw.
that may be, but what do you do then?
the door's alarmed.
building security is here in under a minute, police under five.
here, the computer is kept in a sealed room with a burn vault.
someone breaks in, it melts the drives to slag.
it takes some practice, but counting your steps can be extremely useful if you need to reproduce a floor plan from memory.
not bad. Could be better.
I'll come back tuesday.
we'll talk terms.
once you've memorized the floor plan, you want to get it down on paper as quickly as you can.
combine that with the technical specs of the security devices in the room, and you'll know where the holes in the security are.
then it's just a matter of slipping through one of those holes.
that is a terrible 2.
so let's do the math.
how many 2s in a deck?
four. -Right.
so those are your cards. You can play 2s or 4s.
or, 2 plus 4 is what?
6. -6. You can play an 8.
2 times 4 is what?
8. -You can play a 4, an 8, a 2
uh, I appreciate you trying to distract him, but could you take it outside?
sure.
come on, jimbo.
let's go out on the balcony, get some fresh air so you can concentrate.
figuring out a time when we can have our conversation?
Fi, I'm planning a heist.
um, c-can you just -- I mean, I-I got to do the job
first. Right.
so, what can I do for the job?
I need you to get us into ISO-Gene labs.
it's a DNA-Testing facility one floor above Security Associates.
I need to get in there for an hour at night alone, and we're gonna be making a lot of noise.
you have a high estimation of my skills, Michael.
you've earned every bit of it, Fi.
so, once I'm in, how do I get the data?
it's complicated. You have to, um, br
I have to come with you.
uh, I don't think this is your kind of operation.
I know.
none of this is.
but those computers and hard drives are completely secure, okay?
I made them that way.
so to steal the data, we have to tap into the hardwiring in the wall.
and we'll only have one chance to do that.
well, that's gonna be dangerous.
doesn't matter.
this is for my wife and my daughter.
get me in and I'll get the data.
hold on a sec.
what's the matter?
bum knee.
I got to, you know, tretch it once in...
badly done surveillance.
that is, surveillance you notice.
can mean a lot of things.
some organizations need intelligence but can't afford to pay for training.
okay, okay! Ugh!
some organizations just want you to know they're watching.
who are you? Who sent you?
I don't know.
I answered an ad.
100 bucks to watch and take notes.
some woman.
she give you anything?
Yeah.
she told me not to open this.
hurry UP. WE'RE WATCHING.
I was wondering when you'd call.
Oh, that was some operative you sent.
a freelancer.
I don't think he'll be answering newspaper ads for a while.
Jimmy got our message?
we thought you could use a little reminder of what's at stake here.
Yeah, we head in tonight.
is that soon enough?
that will be fine, thank you.
Now...I need something from you.
what is that?
they could probably be located.
whatever for?
I want them.
if I'm gonna work for you, I want tactical support.
I confess, I'm curious.
fine, you'll have your guns.
and Jimmy's family.
I will give you a date and location.
you will deliver them when and where I say.
of course, Michael.
we want this to be a good experience for everyone.
cook BROS. CONSTRUCTION.
I am so sorry.
we called as soon as we realized the problem.
apparently the engineer missed the defect in the architectural plans.
we're dealing with all the floors.
we'd start with security associates below you, but you're up first, cause you've got all the heavy equipment.
well, lucky us.
I'm just glad you guys caught it before someone fell through he floor.
getting into a secure facility is as simple as giving yourself a good reason to be there.
here we are.
uh, yeah.
it's so stiff.
I'll pull it out.
right here.
right here.
our guys will need a few hours.
the defect's in the beam, so they'll be cutting.
we just need you to notify the building and let the workers in.
the next morning, it will be like we were never here, and I'll be out of your hair.
Hey, you come back anytime you'd like.
they'll be by tonight.
please don't forget to call building security, or I will get into so much trouble.
we can't have that.
I'll call now.
talk to our rep?
she told me you were coming, yes. -How 'bout her, huh?
we're gonna be in the back lab over here.
we're gonna be making some noise.
should only take a couple of hours.
there's some B.S. about the chemicals we use.
now, you can come back, but it's got to be on your insurance.
I'm, uh...
I'm fine here, thanks.
the typical floor is concrete slab over 20-gauge steel pan with steel trusses spaced 30 inches for support.
when you cut through a floor, the thing you have to worry about is wiring.
cut into the wrong wire, and you'll set off the building alarms, electrocute yourself, or both.
if you don't want a chunk of concrete crashing through to the floor below, you need to drill a hole and anchor the slab.
a concrete saw cuts it like butter.
if you've done your planning right, you'll be dropping into a blind spot for the security system, usually behind an interior wall.
motion detectors bounce sound off objects and analyze the reflection.
if something changes, the alarm goes off.
move slow enough, and a wool comforter absorbs enough sound to keep it from triggering.
a thermal blanket, meanwhile, shields your body from heat sensors.
how do you think he's doing in there?
it's Michael.
so, look, Fi...
I got to go back to Veronica, explain where I've been, why I'm all beat to hell, and what happened to the caddy.
I'd pay to watch that. -Oh, come on.
Fi, you're a girl.
what do I say?
I'm your girl consultant now?
when did I sign up for that job?
okay, fine. Forget it.
you know, I got lots of other friends with ovaries.
I got you...
tell her you got beaten up defending a helpless man from a gang of ex lowlife soldiers.
it's true enough.
okay, so I'm the hero.
and the helpless man.
somebody's working late.
better let Mike know.
evening, Mr. Stehl.
Hey, Stevie. Thanks for the call.
so, what's going on?
it's, uh, probably nothing, but you said you wanted us to call you any time if something unusual was going on in the building.
ryder IS BACK.
how long?
I don't know. It's supposed to be backing up now.
the data runs along the cable of the backup drives.
well, what's the problem? Cause we don't have time.
I set the backup for 11: 30.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
okay, it's coming, it's coming. It's coming.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Yes! Yes!
Oh, god.
okay, that's not good. -Give them a minute.
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.
w- what do we do?
plan "b.
quadrangle buckshot is a specialized round designed to destroy the inside of anything delicate
a computer, for example.
get back!
take the rope and tie it off.
we're going out the window?
unless you want to wait around.
for hardened security glass, I prefer FRAG-12, a military round with an explosive projectile.
Ohh, I think I sprained my body.
Hey, you want another beer?
I'm telling you, did wonders for my ribs.
you're fine.
I just want my family back.
we're working on it.
Yeah, how?
those guys at Security Associates, they're gonna kill me as soon as they get a chance.
exactly, and that makes them predictable, and that's how we're gonna solve your problem.
Sam, can you get me a boat, something disposable?
disposable?
Oh, I see where you're going.
I know a guy. Yeah.
it's a decent boat, once upon a time.
it's got mold, but it doesn't sound like it's gonna be around long enough to bother us.
how is this gonna solve my problem?
these guys from Security Associates want to kill you.
we need to give them the opportunity to do just that.
trust me.
the heat that's on you, everyone thinking that you're dead is gonna be the best thing that ever happened to you.
Yeah, Fi?
Michael, I got a delivery today.
someone was kind enough to break into the trunk of my car.
Yeah, what was it?
a present from your friends.
be careful with those, Fi.
they're very hot.
Oh, I'll take good care of them.
Michael, your mother keeps calling me.
these last few days have been a lot for her to handle.
I know the feeling.
go see her, Michael.
I got to go visit my mom.
Sam, get on that boat.
aye, aye, skipper.
you might want to slow down, mom.
how, Michael?
you tell me.
I'm not sleeping.
this business with the coffee maker.
this is about a coffee maker?
it isn't just that.
your brother's still up in Fort Lauderdale, you know.
I mean, he believes it's not safe here.
uh, Nate has disappeared for years before, mom.
he's been in Fort Lauderdale for a few days.
what about me, Michael?
all these years, and finally I see what you do.
you tell me I have to leave town at a minute's notice.
I can't talk on the phone.
we're being chased by men with guns!
how am I supposed to deal with this?
all these years, you wondered why I didn't come home, why I didn't call -- Thisis why, mom.
I never wanted this for you.
I'm sorry.
well, it still doesn't explain why you didn't write.
you want this big, right?
just enough for the boat, Fi.
try not to break all the windows in south beach.
call ryder.
are you sure?
Y- you said the cops will be listening on this phone, so I
that's the point.
we talked about this, and we practiced it, -so if you could do that now. -Okay.
security associates.
uh, I need -- I need to speak to Ryder.
t- tell him that it's Jimmy.
hold, please.
did a hell of a job in my office, kid.
do you really think you're gonna get away with this, huh?
do you have any idea who you just took on?
please, just listen, okay?
it was -- It was the guy, the one, the one that introduced you to.
look, I want to make this right, okay?
if we can just meet, then I can explain everything.
I don't need explanations, Jimmy.
I need my data back.
I want to give it back to you.
that's good.
just tell me where you are.
once the cops pick up a call on a flagged cell, they triangulate its location.
from there, they organize and deploy units, a process that can take 10 minutes, give or take.
bad guys don't have that chain of command.
they can be anywhere as fast as their wheels can take them.
get in position.
stay out of sight.
going down to the boat.
what do we do if he comes out? Do you want us to pop him?
no, I need to figure out what the hell's going on first.
then you pop him.
get going.
you want to talk, we do it face-to-face.
so you coming out, or do I come down to the boat?
how do I know you're not armed?
I don't want to shoot you, Jimmy.
I just want to get my data back.
hold him off. Tell him to prove he's unarmed.
I don't believe you.
okay? Show me. Show me that you don't have a gun.
what do you want me to do?
here. Here. See?
unarmed.
I- I don't believe you.
Jimmy, I'm not messing around.
I'm coming down.
no, wait. Okay, just wait a second. Wait.
he's gonna figure this out. How much longer do I have to do this?
he will go after you and your family for the rest of your life.
now, you will do this now.
do it.
stay back.
you don't want your data all over the internet, do you?
now don't take another step.
all right. All right.
take off your clothes -- the jacket and the pants
and then you can come.
I'm not taking my pants off.
I'm not messing around.
neither am I.
I lied, Jimmy.
want to see my gun?
here it is.
now, want to know what I'm gonna do to you if you don't come out right now?
Yeah. Tell me.
tell me what you're gonna do.
drop it and show me your hands.
stay down!
down! Down!
on your stomach -- now!
get your butt off this deck.
let's go.
move!
nice hardware.
it's not mine.
it's a setup.
put him in the truck.
it's going to be hard for them to explain why they have guns linked to a double homicide.
still, probably best to make sure no one ever knows you're alive.
and my family?
Sam has a friend who's gonna take you on a boat to Haiti tonight.
should be fine.
coast guard doesn't pay much attention to boats going to Haiti.
from there, you'll fly to Argentina and meet your family at the airport.
you really think they'll be there?
well, Carla needs me for other things.
if she doesn't keep her promises to you, she loses me as an asset.
man, I-I don't know how to thank you.
do you want my car?
I mean, it's at my work.
I don't really need it anymore.
it's a SAAB.
convertible.
Yeah.
love convertibles.
Wow. Okay.
there you go.
I got to leave the country, and you're stuck working for them.
I don't know who has it better.
you do, Jimmy. Believe me.
you do.
in intelligence gathering, too little information is obviously a problem, but too much information is just as bad in some ways.
500 files.
and every op looks pretty nasty.
the question is, why does she want this stuff?
no clue, but it's a start.
time to talk.
I...I lost you the other day.
I came back, Fi.
but you left...
you had a choice to make, and you made it.
I always thought...
maybe when it came down to it that...
but you didn't.
what are you saying, Fi?
that I'll always care about you, Michael.
and I'll still help you with your thing, and you'll still help me with mine.
but we can't be together.
I know.
I said that for a long time.
Yes, you have.
when you work as a spy, it's easy to think of people as assets, resources to accomplish a goal...
because you don't have a personal relationship with an asset.
you don't care about an asset.
you don't miss the scent of an asset when she leaves the room.
I think 4 across is "beets.
that looks like a tough one.
a little.
but I'm getting through it.
hmm. Well, if you need any help, I'm right over there.
I was just leaving, actually.
next time?
it's a good thing I'm patching things up with veronica, 'cause if I wasn't, that's a real firecracker there.
Hey, what about you?
you're a free man now that you and fi are, well, you know.
we weren't together, Sam.
okay. Mm.
how'd it go with jimmy?
great. He gave a call.
he's with his family. He's safe.
looks happy enough.
hold on a sec.
Hello?
Hello, Michael.
just wanted to call now that you're done with our little project.
see how that worked out?
he's happy. We're happy. You're happy.
we want to make this arrangement work.
or you'll kill me.
see? Now you're catching on.
Yeah, just one thing.
you said we'd meet.
you promised, I believe
but we did meet, Michael.
tell sam thanks for the help with the crossword.
Oh, sh。
whoa, mike. What's up?
ehjoy THE PUZZLE. I'LL SEE YOU SOON.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing，no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
get your hands on any classified document worth having, chances are, it's going to be redacted, which makes reading it a lot like watching a movie on an airplane.
all the juicy parts are missing, but you still get the basic idea.
anything good?
hard to tell when you only get every third word.
well, are you surprised?
these are the people who burned you, Michael.
you're lucky if you get any information about their operatives.
looks like Carla's cover in Kurdistan was an irrigation consultant.
maybe she could set something up to water the ferns in my apartment.
when she's not threatening your family or forcing you to run black ops.
I'll be sure to ask her.
cheer up.
it's a start, isn't it? - Yeah.
there's a decent chance she's using a similar cover here in Miami.
jobs in agriculture are a convenient cover.
makes it easy to explain your presence in the field and the boardroom.
the only downside is you might have to become an expert on chickpeas.
why don't you put that away?
give it a couple hours.
you, uh...
you might see something that you missed, like a tail.
Lincoln town car up the street.
I saw them before we left my place.
do you think it's them? - Could be.
it's gonna be a very interesting conversation if they catch you with that file.
can I watch?
you drive.
you can tell a lot about who's following you by the maneuvers they use.
quick, evasive driving, a casual bailout, feigning car trouble
these are signs you're dealing with a professional.
smashing into a rickshaw like a crash-test dummy。
that's a sign you're dealing with an amateur, someone who doesn't know what he's doing.
easy, easy, bro!
come on, it's a rental, man!
Nate THE BROTHER
that's when you've really got a problem.
you sure it's safe here?
as safe as it can be.
you want to tell me what you were doing, Nate?
well, I was following you, just making sure you weren't followed.
don't look at me like I'm crazy, all right?
the last time I saw you, you were being chased by guys with guns.
and, by the way, I never got so much as a phone call from you to let me know that things were cool.
and I guess you called mom.
mom called me.
I just figured you wouldn't leave me twisting in the wind in Fort Lauderdale after I risked my ass for you.
it was just a little unclear at the time whether I should... call you.
I'm not here to talk about that.
I got a friend at work who's in trouble.
work?
Yeah, I got a job driving for a limo company.
a real job, an actual job?
I'm friends with the receptionist, and she's in trouble with some Russian Mafia guys.
they're holding her sister.
I was hoping you could help out.
what's the angle?
there's got to be an angle?
there's always an angle, Nate.
what, are you trying to get money from her, you're trying to sleep with her?
maybe I'm just changing my life. Did you think of that?
you blew up my truck, right?
you got me shot at. You had me hide mom.
that's the kind of thing that gets a guy to step back and make a few changes.
and, by the way, I'm still paying off that truck.
it's like $600 a month. - 200
well, $300, but you see what I'm saying.
look, would you just talk to her?
fine. Where is she?
mom's house.
I don't need tea, ma.
it's good. It's herbal.
so, you're gonna help, right, Michael?
that's what I'm here to find out.
excuse me.
uh, ma, could you...
ma.
Yeah. I'll leave the three of you to talk... alone...without me.
it's all right. Tell him, just like you told me.
my sister, Elena.
I've tried to bring her to America for years.
one day, she writes to me, says she found someone to take her here.
I knew something is wrong -- is too good to be true.
she doesn't think.
she gives me a name, and I go.
it's this patsan Ivan -- a gangster.
he brings people here for money.
first, he wants $25, 000 -- all I have.
I go to pick her up this week, and now he wants $50, 000 more.
or you'll never see your sister again.
and if you go to the police, he'll kill her.
that's usually how this kind of thing works.
how'd you get this? He hit you?
Yes.
after I attack him with the -- the bar.
you know, the metal bar for taking out the nails?
you hit him with a crowbar. - Yes.
he's lucky.
his okhrany take me away from him, hauled me away.
if they were not there, I bite his finger off.
Katya asked me to help her get a gun.
after I heard what her problem was,
I figured the best thing for her and her sister would be talking to you.
Nate says you could help.
he says you do these things every day.
I don't do them every day, but I'll see what I can do.
HATYA THE CLIENT
Thanks. Just put that on my friend's tab.
a crowbar?
that sounds like a handful.
come to think of it, I dated a few Ukrainians in my day.
feisty.
Fi's doing the surveillance.
hopefully, we'll track the guy back to where the girls are before Katya gets her hands on a blowtorch.
how's it going with the file on Carla?
pretty good.
talked to a guy named Harvey Gunderson.
he's the secretary-treasurer of the agricultural association of South Florida, among other things.
so, if Carla is still using agricultural specialist as a cover, chances are pretty good that he's heard of her.
nice work, Sam. Just keep it quiet, all right?
can't have this getting back to Carla.
quiet's my specialty, Mike.
Hey, what's your budget on this?
um, you know, I'm thinking it should be face-to-face with Harvey, you know, so I can thoroughly debrief him.
I'll cover it, Sam.
I'll try and keep it reasonable.
who is she?
someone I work with. She's gonna tail Ivan.
hopefully, he'll lead us to where your sister is.
uh, he's there. That is his van.
Ivan HUMAN TRAFFICHER
guy's got interesting tattoos.
russian prison ink.
each one means something.
Really?
what's the spade for?
it means he's a thief.
tiger means "enforcer." - Yeah?
what about the skulls? What are those for?
Mike, what do the skulls mean?
it means murderer, Nate.
murderer? He has my sister! Why we just sit here?
I-I won't let anything happen. I promise.
cultivating intelligence assets usually requires some wining and dining.
Harvey GUNDERSON SECRETARY...
the more connected someone is...
Harvey GUNDERSON PRESIDENT...
the more they know...
Harvey GUNDERSON VICE PRESIDENT...
the more they feel entitled to a little special treatment.
another cocktail?
I think we're ready for a bottle of something, don't you?
uh, I'm still working on the scotch, thank you.
okay, a bottle of scotch. I'm kidding.
excellent choice.
I know it's an excellent choice. I made it.
I'll pick 'em, you bring 'em.
Mmm, it's a hell of a wine. You're gonna love it.
so, anyway, you're thinking of growing hops in Turkey, is it? - Yeah, outside Ankara.
Hey, um, so, harvey, were you able to put together that list of irrigation specialists?
you know, I need to make a few calls and work some things out.
I was thinking about it --you don't want to waste time going through a bunch of names.
I can point you to some topflight people. But you know what?
maybe you and I can take them to dinner together, so you can get to know them, that's all.
Oh, oh, great idea.
Yeah, yeah, but, uh, you know, I really need that list, Harvey, just to make sure I gotall the bases covered.
smart operatives know how to steer the conversation towards the information they need.
you know what you really need, Sam?
clever assets, on the other hand, know how to make the wine-and-dine phase last as long as possible.
the lobster.
no, I'm serious. You ever had the lobster here? - No, no.
swimming off the coast of maine four hours ago. - No kidding.
which reminds me, we should get a bottle of white if we're gonna have the seafood.
Montrachet grand cru -- Unbelievable.
it's liquid gold.
$600?
what can I say, Mike?
the guy ate like it was his last meal.
and the liquor -- I mean, I've had gunshot wounds hurtless than this hangover.
you got, like, a bag of frozen peas or something cold for my head?
did you get the list?
600 bucks and no names?
look, he's just trying to drag it out, okay? Don't worry about it. I'm getting close.
well, do you think he knows Carla?
as far as I can tell, he knows everyone who's ever set foot on a farm in the northern hemisphere.
how'd that thing with Ivan go?
not as well as I was hoping.
I followed him all day.
it's pretty clear he just collects the money, stays away from the girls till it's over.
it's smart security.
if he has no contact with his guys, no calls, no conversations, then the cops can't make a decent case, and we can't find the girls.
if we're gonna find the girls by Friday, we'll need to extract the information.
how about it, Sam?
interrogation?
well, it's -- boy, it's been a while, Mikey, but, you know, it's just like riding a bike.
if we can snatch him by this afternoon, we'll have three days to work on him.
Oh, that's cutting it close.
I mean, maybe if we hit the ground running, make him think he's up against the big boys.
you know, the government types.
we don't have a deep bench here.
I don't know. I think we can do it.
fi grabs the guy. She's the extraction team.
you and me tag-team the guy on the questions.
we do the sunglasses, the suit, the whole bit, make him think he's up against every agency with initials.
you think you can bag him alone, FI?
I like your taste.
thank you.
I am Ivan.
stun guns are a great way to bring down a larger opponent.
the only problem is, if you use one on someone who's touching you, you'll zap yourself, too.
you brought a toy. You want to play.
Oh, I love to play.
Fi, you are one crazy chick.
how's our friend Ivan behaving?
like an altar boy.
he even asked me to use the stun gun on him again.
he asked you with a gag in his mouth?
Oh, he has expressive eyes.
feeling better, FI?
everyone could use a few thousand volts from time to time -- it clears the mind.
all righty.
I got a palin organized crime.
ran down everything he had on this Ivan character.
whew, he's a hard rock from the motherland.
and what brings him to these fair shores?
well, they got him linked up to what they think is a Russian syndicate active on the east coast, pretty much from here to New York.
now, the guy who handles the day-to-day operations in Miami named Takarov.
but this guy, Mike, I mean, he's seen the inside of every prison from Moscow to Minsk, so I think the best approach here is, we know everything, we're rolling up his whole gang, and he's just a little fish.
well, you're the expert, Sam. What else?
good news.
I found the perfect place for our secret facility.
it's an old concrete plant in the middle of nowhere.
they condemned it after the last hurricane.
this is gonna be fun, Mike.
a lot of people's first instinct when they need information out of a captive is to grab a baseball bat or a gun.
this works.
Yeah, I've been in plenty of secret facilities a lot less impressive than this.
you get a cooler, a drink, some snacks -- we are set.
Fi's driving Ivan to the everglades and back.
is that enough time? - Plenty.
the fact is, torture is for sadists and thugs.
it's like getting groceries with a flamethrower.
it doesn't work, and it makes a mess.
getting useful information is about creating a new reality for the interrogation subject with no hope of escape or freedom.
you control every aspect of their world
how they eat, where they sleep, even whether it's day or night.
when it's time to ask questions, you want them disoriented, anxious, wondering who you are and what you can do to them.
you have to make them understand that their entire future, their hopes, their dreams, every breath they will ever take from then on, it all depends on one thing -- talking.
Hello, Ivan.
I want a lawyer now.
I know my rights!
you have to get me a lawyer now!
that would be true...
if I was a cop.
who are you? CIA?
c-i what?
no, no, see, they're only allowed to operate on foreign soil, so just think of me as uncle...
uncle Sam.
do I get a phone call, uncle?
you get whatever you want after I get what I want.
what do you want?
I want to get to know you better.
I want to know all about a day in the life of Ivan.
where do you go? What do you do?
just think of me as your personal diary.
I deliver cheese, caviar, and sausage to Russian markets and restaurants.
can I go now, uncle?
don't waste my time, Ivan.
we know what you do.
we know who you are.
and you, sir...
are just a little fish.
you know the difference between big fish and little fish?
when big fish get caught, they get cooked and eaten.
when little fish are caught, they get thrown back in the lake to swim away
unless they piss off Mr. Fisherman.
I'm offering you a chance to swim away, Ivan.
it's better for both of us, really, 'cause if you don't accept it, whoo, boy, it's a lot of paperwork for me and a dark, little room for you.
it's not so bad.
I've been in nightclubs darker than this.
maybe I like it here.
now, look, Mike, we could send you back in there as good cop, bad cop, whatever.
I don't know what good it's gonna do.
I mean, this guy is gulag-tough. I've seen the type.
now, after a month, when he's been in isolation so long, he's howling at the moon, you know, maybe.
we got three days, Sam.
well, that's why I think our best bet might be to have a friend inside.
they speak the same language, someone to talk to, confide in.
prison buddy? - Yeah.
now, look, I'd do it, Mikey, but he knows me already.
come on, it's not gonna be that bad.
we'll set up a cellfor the two of you, bring your brother in --he can play guard.
Mike, give the kid a break.
I mean, we need a fresh face here.
I can't sell Ivan on a secret CIA compound run by one guy.
Plus, I got to get back to Harvey Gunderson and see if he knows Carla.
I'm tap-dancing as fast as I can.
I'll call him.
so, wait a minute.
you go in the cell with Ivan, that's your plan?
if he knows what we want, he can lie, hold out until the girls are gone.
we need him to think that I'm on his side, that I'm safe to talk to.
Nate, these are for you. Do what Sam tells you to do, all right?
Hey, I can handle it.
you just take care of you, all right, bro?
it's unfortunate but true that no makeup can simulate blood and bruises well enough to stand up to close observation.
so if your cover requires looking like you've been beaten...
you have to get beaten.
Nate! - What?
just trying to be a team player.
today is your lucky day, Ivan.
got one of your boys in there to keep you company.
it can take a lifetime to convince someone to trust you.
you two play nice, now.
it's much quicker to make them feel like they need you to trust them.
you have the face of a traitor.
what?
who are you?
you talked.
you don't know me. - I kept quiet.
you, not a scratch.
be careful what you say.
how much did they pay?
I am no traitor.
what did you tell them?
you piece of crap!
what did you tell them?
nothing.
a fight is one of the quickest ways to tell if someone isn't who they say they are.
if you say you're Russian but fight like an American, consider your cover blown, which means you better know sambo, the mixed martial art of Russia.
of course, you also have to win the fight.
a great cover I. D.Doesn't help much if you're dead.
what did you tell them?
I told them... nothing!
what did you tell them? - Nothing!
I swear it.
good.
who are you?
Sergei Yablonovich. I work up in Tampa.
you're Russian?
born in Volgograd.
raised in America.
you're Ivan Petrov.
you run the girls, right?
who do you think gets your shipments through customs?
they shut down the operation in Tampa. It's done.
they're moving down here.
they're closing in.
how did they find you?
I was ambushed by a little suka.
they said they know about Takarov's headquarters.
did you tell them?
I said I told them nhing.
then how do they know these things? They know when your deliveries are!
they know what kind of vodka Takarov drinks!
maybe they are watching!
maybe they have someonein the deli or the caf? I don't know!
I kept quite.
Yeah, make sureyou stay that way.
so, if Mike's information was right, that's probably the place.
I mean, there's not too many Russian restaurants next to a caf? across from a deli.
Hi, Harvey.
how's it going, bud?
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I got the list.
uh, I've got to tell you, I was hoping for more than two names on it, though, but...
Oh, well, I'm sure they're the best, yeah.
uh, okay. Yeah, sure.
I'll -- I'll see you then.
another meeting. He is working you.
I've gotten nuclear secrets out of KGB agents for less time and money.
good thing my liveris flexible because a lesser man would be dead.
okay, where did we get a thermal camera?
I borrowed it from my neighbor's boat.
he's been using it to peek at me through the walls in my apartment, so I figure we're even.
a thermal camera is a great tool for scouting.
it'll tell you where the warm bodies are in a building or which rooms are designed to make those bodies invisible.
top floor is heat-shielded.
see the guy in the corner?
that's him -- Takarov.
TAHAROV THE BOSS
he runs half the Russian Mafia in South Florida.
looks like there's a little business upstairs, too.
you ready?
Oh, my -- Oh, man, that's horrible!
get the manager! Somebody get the manager!
what is problem, sir?
are you the manager?
I didn't think so. Go get a manager.
make him go away.
you call that food? Get the chef!
he's an imposter, the freak!
Oh, there he is.
Mr. Manager, I got a big -- what? Hello!
Hey, ho, I needed that.
get your hands off me. I'm an American citizen.
one issue in dealing with modern criminal gangs is that their operations are diversified.
the heat shielding you hope is hiding a human-smuggling operation...
sorry, I was looking for the ladies' room.
could be hiding radio emissions from software-pirating computers.
we call it "customer service"!
you break my arm, you're hearing from my lawyer!
keep it up --I'll own this place!
take your hands off my father!
he has... dementia.
do you understand?
can't you see his mind is gone?
he doesn't even know what he's saying.
come on, daddy.
daddy?
bet you never thought you'd hear me call you that.
it has been days now, and all you do is talk!
Katya, we're working on it, okay?
I know it's hard, but you have to be patient.
and my sister -- how long does she have to be patient?
take me to Ivan.
what do you want, Katya?
do you want to hit Ivan with a wrench, or do you want your sister back?
cause it's got to be one or the other.
and this place Romanov's -- Nate says that Ivan's boss is there.
why don't we go there?
I don't know what Nate told you, but we have to stick to the plan.
my sister doesn't have time for your plans.
I'm going to them now and trade myself for Elena.
Nate, you told her about Romanov's?
it's called "need to know" for a reason.
I'll take care of it.
Katya, hold up.
she's my sister.
I know, and Michael's my brother.
and I can't stand that guy sometimes, but he's good at what he does.
if he says that this is the right thing to do, then this is the right thing to do.
it's gonna be all right.
just... go and talk to him.
Nate, I was just in the hall, and I heard what you said about your brother.
that is so sweet.
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
not that he'd do the same for me.
a good interrogator paints a picture of the world outside for a detainee.
whatever he's holding onto, you take it away.
his organization -- crumbling, his friends -- traitors, his precious information -- useless.
gum?
Mmm, cinnamony.
Mmm, Ivan, good news.
we're about to wrap this up.
looks like we won't need you much longer.
that's why you have me in this hole -- because you don't need me?
Hey, I'm doing you a favor. I'm giving you a chance to come clean.
you know, we're moving on Romanov's next week.
great restaurant.
try the borscht.
look, the point is, if you want to see daylight again, you'll give me something useful.
and, hey, now would be the time.
well, I can see you're on the fence.
so, I'm gonna give you some time to consider your options.
you can wear the thinking bag.
and here's some thinking music!
is he tenderized yet?
Oh, he's getting there.
said he likes nightclubs, so I thought I would oblige him.
so, I figure we let him stew in there for another couple hours then put him back into the cell with you.
he'll be nice and loopy and happy to see his old friend Sergei.
are you off to see Harvey Gunderson again?
Mike, I underestimated him, that's all.
he's going down.
the best of bulgarian disco? - Yeah.
we'll save that for bedtime.
it'll peel the paint off the walls.
wish me luck, fellas.
working an information source is a delicate art.
ideally, you can get all the information you need with kind words and free drinks.
more wine? - You betcha.
when drinks and good company aren't enough, however, a good operative has to apply pressure, and that means knowing just what a source loves.
just wondering about that, uh, that list.
how's that going?
great. I'm working on it.
there's a lot of agricultural experts in Miami, believe me.
I'm making that list, checking it twice.
just want to make sure I don't leave any names off.
could we get some morecrab cakes here, please?
sure, sure, in just a minute, but first I want to ask you something.
sure.
do you like being secretary-treasurer of the agricultural association of South Florida?
Nah, I'm trying to get back to teaching high school.
do I like it? What, are you kidding? What are you talking about? I love it.
it's the largest agroeconomic trade association east of the Mississippi, and I'm two heartbeats away from the presidency. Why?
cause I think you're jerking me around, Harvey.
I came to you asking for a very simple list of Miami agricultural specialists, and you drank my wine and you ate my food and you gave me nothing!
you have no idea who you're dealing with here, Harvey.
do you know why I'm interested in agriculture in central Turkey?
let me tell you -- I don't give a rat's ass about growing hops, okay?
I care about opium poppies. I'm with the dea!
DEA?
now, one call to my buddies at the department of agriculture.
and let's just say they have a little bit of influence over who can be the president of the board of soil scientists.
I mean, one day you're the chairman of the Miami water resources board, and the next day they won't even let you in the front door.
now, I've seen the bad boys of the USDA destroy people, Harvey, and, believe me, it's not pretty.
no, wait. Please, please! Don't go. Sit down.
you'll have the list tomorrow. I swear.
make sure I do.
liquid gold.
Oh, yeah, it's the best.
they have you for hours and still they don't touch you?
they asked me questions, then left me in a room with a bag on my head.
I guess you're just lucky.
you want to say something, say it.
every day they have new information!
I know.
the American -- he says they're moving on romanov'S.
someone in your organizationis talking.
they gave us up.
if they know where the girls are... - impossible.
no one knows where is the safe house but me.
Ivan, if the Americans link Takarov to the girls.
you think I'm stupid?
my men have orders.
if anyone but me comes to the safe house, they kill the girls and leave.
if they don't hear from me by Friday, same thing.
Takarov has nothing to worry about from me.
I am sorry.
I should not have doubted you.
the American can ask whatever he wants.
by the time they do anything, the girls are dead.
great.
so I got to tell Katya that we did all this for nothing, that her sister's gonna be killed?
I'm not gonna let that happen. - How? Huh?
what are you gonna do, use your spy magic?
come on, Ivan has got to beat the safe house by tomorrow, or Elena's dead.
and he can't be there because we've got him in a box in a concrete plant.
he's going to have to escape.
escape? Are you serious?
he's got to go to the girls himself.
he's not gonna buy it if we just let him go.
that's crazy, man.
have you got a better idea, Nate?
because we don't have a lot of time here.
you asked for my help. You want it or not?
if you want my help, we got to go to the concrete plant and do this.
if you don't, tell Katya to get ready for her sister's funeral.
okay.
I'll get my suit.
Michael, your brother is trying. - Ma.
please, you sent him off to Fort Lauderdale and left him there for weeks.
I mean, what is that, some sort of covert-operations thing, or is it just a lousy way to treat your brother?
ma, I've been living in astorage container for two days.
maybe we can call it even.
Michael, it isn't just about what you do.
it's about what you say, too.
he cares what you think --more than you know.
do you know what his first word was?
it was "Michael."
it was "juice." I was there.
his first word was "juice" .
well, he was looking right at you when he said it.
you know what he meant.
you were his hero.
ma, I just don't want to get into this right now.
Michael, please, look, I know that Nate has had his problems.
but you know when it all first started and when he first got into really serious trouble?
it was right after you left.
give him a chance.
what? What is wrong with you? You can't stand still.
you heard them.
this is almost over.
and when they're done with us, they're gonna throw us in some CIA hellhole for the rest of our lives.
if, by some miracle, they let us go, we're gonna be dead anyway.
dead? What are you talking about?
what will Takarov think?
he will hold us responsible!
we will speak for each other!
I will tell him you were strong.
you kept your mouth shut.
before he cuts your throat or after?
no, no, no, no, we need to get out of here.
listen, if we can get to the girls, maybe grab them, move them, show Takarov that we fought.
escape? You are dreaming.
can I trust you?
can I trust you with my life?
Yes.
they showed me a file with surveillance photos.
Takarov --I swore I didn't know him.
they beat me, but I got this.
I can open the handcuffs.
we can overpower the guard.
maybe we get out, maybe we die.
but if we don't get out, we die anyway.
are you with me? - Then what?
we don't even know what's on the outside of that door.
Oh, I heard them talking.
it's not a real jail.
it's temporary.
they're gonna move us to a real prison.
you have to decide now. Now!
he'll handcuff you to the wall.
you keep him busy. You distract him.
I'll take care of the lock. You understand?
understand?
da, I understand.
all right, let's go.
feeling a little more talkative now?
you really think you can do this to us?
shut up.
we have people everywhere.
doesn't matter who you are -- CIA, FBI -- we can find you and kill you just the same.
Hey, you ever want to see the light of day again, shut your face.
let's go.
one of the hardest things to do in a fight is to make it look like you're trying to kill someone without doing permanent damage.
they don't teach any half moves in combat training.
there are moves designed to kill and maim as efficiently as possible.
if those are off limits, one option is opening your first right before a punch lands.
painful, but the force is distributed.
another showy option is a kick to the shoulder.
you might break a rib or two, but if you aim right, nobody's going to the morgue.
put it down!
I said drop it!
don't. Don't kill me! No, please!
let's go.
where is the other one? - Back there.
I heard him begging.
after the beatings he gave me, he deserved to die more slowly.
we have to go to Romanov's.
what, and show up at Takarov's empty-handed? No.
we got to show them we thought of the organization first.
where are the girls?
Ivan, we don't have time for this! Where are the girls?
they're in Hialeah. I will show you.
this is it? - Yes.
do you think they've been here? Does anything look different?
it's fine. See the van?
it means the girls are still here.
where have you been?
I'll tell you later. We need to move the girls now.
what? Who is he?
this is sergei. He's all right. Now move! Go!
everyone to the van!
let's go, girls! Let's go!
quickly, quickly! Move!
we have to get them out of here.
do you have a place? - Yes.
there is another safe house that Takarov uses for guns.
how do you know the CIA isn't already there?
we can't use any place they might know about.
then where? Where can we take them?
I got a place down by the docks.
no one knows about it but me.
you are sure it's safe?
you're right. I should bring some of your guys, take some guns along, just in case.
you go to Takarov's.
you tell him they might be moving on romanov'S.
who knows? We might come out heroes.
you two. Go with Sergei. Do as he says.
he knows how to handle himself.
Sergei, I don't forget this.
I'm sure you won't, Ivan.
where do we take the girls?
there's been a change of plans.
it's all over. Drop the gun.
it's all right. You're safe now.
in the spy game, you spend a lot of time getting people to betray their own.
most do it for money. Some do it for spite.
but the greatest achievement is to get a guy to turn on his own people because he thinks he's being loyal.
you have to get ou what? What are you talking about?
they busted the operation in Tampa. They're coming here next.
they had me and Sergei, but we escape.
what operation in Tampa?
we never had an operationin Tampa.
but -- but Sergei...
who's Sergei?
he took the girls!
he said he worked for youin Tampa!
it was the CIA.
they had us.
you talked to the CIA?
you gave the girls to this Sergei, and then you come here?
take him upstairs now!
Sam talked to a police buddy of his.
sounds like Takarov was worried enough to skip town with most of his crew.
apparently, he headed north because they found Ivan's body in a dumpster in Fort Lauderdale.
a dumpster is too good for him.
what my sister means say is "thank you." - Yeah.
how is your pain?
breathing's a little difficult.
Mike cracked three of my ribs.
but, you know, it was a small price to pay.
I'm sorry I was angry.
Nate said you know what to do --always you were right.
this Nate? Nate said that?
you wanted me to keep her at mom's. I just said what I had to say.
thank Nate, Katya.
I could nave done it without him.
and I'm not always right.
$1, 350, and all Sam got on Carla was a P. O.Box.
more than I had, FI.
besides, I don't think he could have survived any more intelligence gathering.
Sam's liver can take a vacation while we...
what do we do now?
now we watch.
someone's got to pick up the mail sometime.
I hate surveillance.
intelligence-gathering isn't all running around with a gun and a spy camera.
when the operation demands it, you get to sit in a hot car with no air-conditioning in downtown Miami.
my name is michael westen.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, michael.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
one of the reasons surveillance is done in teams
sitting
doing - My turn. - What?
five minutes?
Fose the post offe box used by one of the people who burned you?
Carla's not just one of the people who burned me.
she's all I've got.
are you sure the manager said today?
he said the mail for this box is picked up every wednesday.
did I tell you that I despise surveillance?
only every time we do it.
Oh, here we go.
if that's carla, that's one hell of a disguise.
Yeah, carla's not the type to collect her own mail.
tailing a trained operative requires a number of time-consuming preparations
everything from acquiring a vehicle they can't recognize or trace to familiarizing yourself with all the local traffic patterns.
go ahead,Put it in drive.
of course, since you can never be sure who's a trained op, there's always the chance you'll take all those precautions just to follow a secretary back to her cubicle.
that's carla's building?
no guards, no camera?
you really think carla would work out of there?
security comes in all shapes and sizes, babe.
hungry?
covert security is designed to blend in -- people you never notice...
until you see them in action.
that means you have two choices.
you can sit and wait for an incident to occur, or you can create your own incident.
Hello?
yo, bro, got your grub. I'm out front.
all right, I'll come down and meet you in the lobby, but you can't park there.
this okay?
no, man. That's even worse.
you got to be kidding me, man.
where you going? Go back.
dude! Dude, you are just asking for a ticket, parking there.
you know what, buddy. I really don't have time for this.
Hey, sorry, man, I'm just trying to help. You know what?
just pull around the back and go down the alley. I'll meet you there.
fine. Just make it quick.
I think we found carla.
Hey, mikey.
look at that. That looks good.
so, I pulled the building records and lease docs for that address you gave me for carla's little irrigation consulting company.
anything good?
office is right there.
second floor, east end. But it's gonna be tough getting in there unseen.
I need to find if their security has a routine.
maybe there's a chink in the armor.
a wireless webcam might get what you need, but you got to figure out a way to get it in place.
do you think you could find a setup with a strong enough signal?
I don't know. Maybe later today if I have time.
nice watch, sam.
thank you. It's a panerai. Ferrari version.
I think they prefer to call them "timepieces.
anyway, veronica got us his-and-hers for our anniversary.
well, apparently, it's been a whole month since we both said "I love you.
for that, you get an $8, 000 watch?
and some other things.
you michael?
no.
cause they said this guy michael lives around here.
a lot of people live around here.
they say he drives a black car, too. Dodge.
who's "they"?
look, man, I'm not trying to bother you.
it's just that -- all right, here's the deal.
I just got out of prison a couple months ago.
I had a cellmate in there, said he had a pretty sweet scam going on.
cops couldn't touch him. This guy michael comes along, blows his whole operation up.
that's the kind of friend I need.
name's trevor.
you got the wrong guy.
at least hear my problem. - Sorry.
wait, man.
go home.
please.
60 seconds. Go.
okay, all right, uh, okay, I got a
I got a reputationin certain circles as an expediter of getaways.
wheelman.
I do more than that.
I find the right car, modify it as necessary, get rid of it clean, plus I plan the escape route.
you're an expediter.
no, I used to be.
see, last time I was in prison, I saw the light, man. I decide dto turn my life around.
I got my G. E. D.I got certified as a mechanic, and now I'm tryingto stay clean, no matter what.
30 seconds.
problem is, I got this boss named timo.
he runs this crew that I used to work with a few times.
pick it up. - They're planninga jewel heist.
it's going down during thistrade show that's coming up.
tell them you can't do it.
I did. I even offered to find them a replacement.
the thing is, timo likes to workwith the same people he knows, especially during big jobs.
he told me he would feel personally betrayed if I didn't come throughwith this.
I'm sure he'll get over it.
you don't know Timo. That's his way of saying,"do it or die.
can you leave town for a while?
not without violatingmy parole.
I got to stay in the statefor the next five months.
time's up. You got two options.
go to the police, tell themeverything you just told me...
timo will kill my family.
they have witness protection. - Yeah, right.
or you do the job. Don't get caught. Either way, I can't help you.
I got emeralds, man. These are real.
you can get 15 grand easy, and it's clean.
I gota 2-carat diamond ring.
Trevor, I heard you out.
now you need to walk away.
I got a son, man. He was bornwhile I was locked up.
I'm sorry to hear that. - I don't want youto be sorry.
I just want you to understandwhere I'm coming from.
I made a promise to my boy that I was done with that life.
and I ain'tbreaking that promise.
Trevor THE CLIENT
come on.
criminal hideouts tend to be pretty nondescript.
underground caves and spooky, old mansions are dramatic, but a boathouse on the keys is easier to find.
well, your boy trevor -- he's running withsome pretty impressive company.
I mean, every name he gave you -- first-round pick if you weredrafting your own crew.
What'd he say the job was?
he didn't.
he knows it's jewels, but he doesn't know where or when.
this guy timo likesto keep details to himself.
here we go.
C. J.THE HUSTLER
C. J. Mr. Slickster from Jersey.
arrested up and down the east coast.
fraud, embezzlement. Nothing recent.
this big guy'sthe safecracker?
Gilbert THE SAFE CRACHER
Gilbert kessler, one of the best.
any record?
Ah, he rung up three D. U.I. Sin the last two years, so, technically, he's not evensupposed to be driving.
okay, here's a doozy.
kandi THE MUSCLE
Kandi, originally from california.
assault and battery, assault and battery Assault with a deadly weapon.
her and Fiona would have a good time or, you know, kill each other.
Oh, and this must be timo.
suspect in mostof the bigger unsolved heists in the greater miami area.
timo THE BOSS Only arrested once.
and the only witness was murdered.
so, you got a plan yet?
the best way to help trevoris to get the job called off.
but you don't even knowwhat it is.
I'm hoping that won't matter. - How's that?
crew like this runslike a well-oiled machine.
somebody gets in troublewith the police, that machine stops working.
I'm telling you, I think this safecracker gilbertcould be your guy.
his probation has a no-drinking restriction, so you get him pulled over after one beer, it's jail time.
Fi, would you liketo make a new friend?
he's a safecracker.
I'm hoping you can convince himto have a drink with you.
good-looking guy.
is this seat taken?
no, uh, sit down.
bring us your best champagne.
Fifi.
Gilbert.
nice to meet you. - My pleasure.
somebody has to toast with me.
what are you celebrating?
why, you and me, of course.
I get it.
this is a sales pitch. You're an escort.
well, I don't drink, and I don't pay to play either.
enjoy the champagne.
when you're looking to get somebody arrested, bad guys can't always be counted on to commit crimes on your schedule.
sometimes you have to give them a little push.
what the hell are you doing?
that's my table.
I've been waiting for an hour for my special table.
what? - Don't you "what" me.
get your ass out of here.
don't touch me, buddy. - I just did.
there I go again and again and ag
once you've got a crime in progress, you can let the authorities take over.
that assumes, of course, that the authorities are paying attention.
is that the best you got, huh?
come on! Come on, big guy. Show me something, huh?
come on! You fight like a girl!
police! Somebody! He's killing that guy!
timo called.
gilbert's in jail, but the job's still on.
Trevor, you said, if timo lost his safecracker, the job would be off.
I know. Any other time, he would have called it off.
what did he say?
he said he'd been working this angle for the last two years, and it was too big a scoreto let gilbert ruin it.
he's trying to track downsome guy from georgia.
here, I'm thinking, if I try to do the right thing, I might just catch a break.
who was I fooling?
there's another way we can get the job called off. - How?
find out the target, tip them off.
timo's already on edge.
I start asking questions now -- - no, no, no, no.
you stay focused on making Timo think you're a team player.
I'll ask the questions. - Wait. What?
taking gilbert outdidn't get the job called off, but it did createa job opening.
now, you call timo. You tell him that you founda safecracker who's local.
who, you? - Yeah.
you crack safes? 'Cause timo'snot gonna take my word for it.
just -- just make the call.
tell himI'll meet him tomorrow.
I've got some things to do tonight.
you can't stop a door alarm from going off, but you can explain it.
leave a few cigarette butts on the ground, and anybody coming by will assume someone was just sneaking a smoke break.
I'm on the roof across from carla's building, sam.
are you ready? - Give me one second here.
24/7 surveillance on a location used to require a full team of operatives.
these days, you can get by with a webcam and wireless signal booster from your local electronics store.
ideally, you'd drill holes and mount it on brackets, but when time is an issue, I prefer dental putty.
easy to mix, easy to apply, and strong as cement when it hardens.
but it hardens quick...
how's it looking, sam?
so you better aim right the first time.
Hello, carla!
we're in business, Mikey.
you getting out clean?
sounds like building security'sgetting curious. Call you back.
making yourself invisible when you need to is a crucial skill for a covert operative.
it sounds exotic, but it's not like there's a supersecret move they teach you at spy school that allows you to vanish into think air.
often it's just a matter of quick thinking, fast feet, and strong fingers.
Hey, mikey.
hurry up. I got good news.
good news? I could use some good news.
I think I found a gap in thesecurity at carla's building.
I'm telling you, Mikey, sometimes I surprise myself.
it's beautiful.
I did a little editingon the surveillance tape.
check this out.
I time-lapsed the footage here, just to see if there'sany kind of a routine, but the maintenance man and thegardener don't really have one.
they patrolin random intervals, so the best you could dois guess.
waiting for the good part, Sam. - Coming.
okay, about 3: 45, night security gets there.
and before they switch over, everyone goes around backfor about five minutes,
I'm guessing, for some kind of debrief.
during that time, the only guy watching the front is the old manat the coffee shop.
still waiting for the good news, Sam.
because grandpa can't walk the place like he works there, any time somebody heads downthat side alley, he takes a little stroll And that is our window.
nice work, sam.
Thanks, mike. I'd love to bask in the glory, but I got my big "one month since we said,'I love you'" celebration.
Sammy's gettin'some hammy tonight.
I keep pinching myself to make sure I'm not dreaming.
I just can't believe how happy I am.
we are on a nice little roll here.
it's like I've waited for youto show up for my entire life, and now I finally...
I sound like such a teenager.
well, you've gotthe body of a teenager.
you -- you might as well sound like one.
you are so sweet...
and you make me feel so good.
Hey, pumpkin, you know this isn't just a one-way street.
look, I've beenall over the world.
I've known a lot of women.
so when I tell you, without a doubt, you are one in a million...
you can believe it, Roni.
marry me.
how about that, huh? There's a question.
safecracking skills are a basic part of espionage training.
spies steal secrets, and people keep their secrets in safes.
but staying current with safecracking is a little like staying current with computers.
new model every year.
bottom line -- if you want to breach a safe, you have to practice.
I was one number away from the combination.
the last one's always the same. C4.
always easier to just blow it.
you really think he's gonna test you?
probably. He's a control freak.
at the very least, I need to make it sound good.
Oh, you've been out of the game a while, michael.
there are all kinds of new toys nowadays.
that looks likeit would leave a mess.
you're such a snob when it comes to manipulation techniques.
on a real heist, they'reoverrated and impractical.
you don't like it because it takes patience.
I won't deny that I prefer a power tool.
Hello? Yeah, trev?
just let me know when.
timo is ready to meet.
a criminal cover I. D.Isn't just about a new name and phone number.
it's about fitting into a culture with its own rules and hierarchies.
it's a world where bank robbers are the rock stars, con artists are the snobs, car thieves are the blue-collar guys, and safecrackers are the artists.
I usually work for safe companies, you know, when grandmaforgets the combination or the bank managerforgets the security code.
they call the best.
how often do you freelance?
two or three jobs a year, based on timing and pay.
I'm surprised I haven't heard of you.
I take great painsnot to be heard of.
so, what's this safe we're looking to compromise.
you'll have to bear with me, joe. - Joseph.
Oh, excuse me. Joseph.
now, I'm sure you have questions, and you'll get answers, but not yet.
I don't usually work with peopleI don't know.
so, how about we get to know each other, huh? Come on.
you just quit.
no cameras to worry about.
crack it.
no. - Excuse me.
if you're looking for a guyto crack a liquor-store safe, I'm not your man.
indulge me.
y-you're gonna shoot me?
last time I checked, you needed a safecracker.
you know what?
Trevor vouched for you.
crack it now, or he dies.
come on. I want us allto be friends. Crack the safe... now.
you want to see a show, I need a cup.
let's go.
anytime you recommend a friend for a job, you're on the hook if things don't work out.
in the retail-sales business, for example, make a bad referral, and you might get fired.
in the armed-robbery business, on the other hand, make a bad referral, and you might get killed.
look a little jumpy, trevor, you're not nervous, are you?
no.
so you really, really have to hope that the new guy knows what he's doing.
happy? - Nice.
be at this address. 3:00.
don't touch that.
don't touch anything.
you know trevor. You already met kandi. This is C. J.
welcome to the family, joseph.
answer by the third ring, no matter what.
no excuses.
I don't care if you'rein the shower, you answer.
now, sit down. We're gonnago over a few things.
we'll be coming infrom here. - Are we breaking in?
no, man, it's sweeter than that.
your concern for secrecyis admirable, but I need to know if there will be people there.
we'll handle it.
and where will this affair be taking place?
you'll find out soon enough.
let me put it another way. If someone screams, will they be heard?
let me put it this way.
I've covered every aspectof this plan, down to the smallest detail.
all you need to worry about is cracking the safe.
fine. Tell me about the safe.
Madison ak series, class ii, composite
composite hardplate. And the lock?
manual combination. That's good.
you'll have 19 minutes. - 19 minutes?
Oh, it's doable.
I'll need to know other variables, though.
I already told you --we'll cover it!
let's move on. - Not so fast. Question.
No! No more questions.
you know what you need to know. Now, shut up and listen.
really, smart guy? Then, when was it installed?
cause, as you know, ilco implements countermeasuresevery year to stop people like me.
so, if I have 19 minutes, I will need to know what versionI'm dealing with.
it was put in two years ago.
great. Now we can move on.
this meeting is over. Everybody out.
Trevor? You can stay.
Trevor. - What's up?
you're not answeringyour phone.
damn it! Oh, I hope Timo didn't call.
I forgot to turn it back on.
why'd he hold you back?
I thought I was in trouble.
he just wanted to give me a scatter point.
timo gives me the location.
I park the vehiclesfor the crew nearby.
anything goes wrong, we take separate routes back to the boathouse.
so the heist must be close by.
three jobsI've done with Timo, he's always given me the location within a half a mile of the place we're hitting.
this might be all the info we need.
to find the target? - Maybe.
the vault Timo wants to hit is very high-end.
outside of banks, there's not a lot of buildings that would have one.
those things are damn near indestructible, so the city makes you geta special permit to put one in.
knowing when it was installed would narrow it way down.
we can get it downto about a half-mile radius.
I can give you something by tomorrow.
you'll know who to tip offby tomorrow, so I don't have to get the backup vehicles.
Mmm, no.
you need to act "business as usual" until it's over.
right. - Come on.
I better get back there. - Go.
so, Mikey, uh, you never asked me about my date.
Oh, how'd your date go?
not real good.
I'm sorry to hear that.
she popped the question, buddy.
the marriage question?
Yeah, you know it.
and you said?
I didn'T. That's part of the problem. She's freaking out, waiting for an answer.
so give her one.
well, I'd love to, mike, but, uh, there's some issues here.
do you love her?
she could be the one.
then say yes.
but it's complicated.
then say no.
you're a true friend, Mikey.
you're finished placing the cars?
Yeah. Dropped timo's car off around the corner.
is that the target?
so now we tip them off.
we have a little snag. - What?
see for yourself.
apparently, he's obtained gainful employment.
he's Timo's inside manat the jewelry exchange.
Oh, man.
if we're not careful about who we talk to and how...
timo's gonna know that he has a leak.
his first guess is gonna be me or you.
either way, it's bad for you.
so, that's it. I'm screwed.
no, we're still gonna tip off the store.
we just have to find a wayto do it without C. J.Knowing.
I'll deal with this.
I'll let you know when it's done. Go ahead.
thank you, sir.
five bucks, buddy.
are you kidding me?
all set?
Yeah. Told him to make the blockonce and head down the alley.
then mike can make his moveon carla's building.
Fi, I need some advice.
I'm trying to come up with a gift.
something that says, "I love you, but I can't marry you.
and not too expensive.
there's no such thing, Sam.
why can't you marry her?
well, there's stuff involved. - "Stuff"?
grownup stuff, okay? You wouldn't understand.
it's obvious how much you care for her.
well, I'm not saying I don'T.
well, then, why can't you marry her?
cause it's against the law, all right?
I'm already married, technically.
you're gonna get flies in there.
look, it was the '70s. I did it on a whim.
we both knew the next dayit was a big mistake, but we never got aroundto getting divorced.
that's not something you "get around to," Sam.
look, Fi, the truth is, I didn't think any of it mattered, 'cause I wasn't the marrying type...
until now.
forget about the gift, Sam.
just tell Veronica the truth. She'll understand.
we all have skeletons. Terrible, terrible skeletons.
here comes our boy.
and the old guy gets up, goes to check on the alley...
and in you go, mikey.
I'm in the shower.
you have 30 minutes to get here.
Where's he going? He's gonna blow it.
Mike, what happened? You were clear.
timo called. He wants me at the boathouse.
we'll deal with Carla's building later.
Sam, I think I'm gonna need some backup.
what's going on? - Put those on.
no more questions.
get dressed, get your gear, get in the van.
I'm not doing this. - Calm down.
I'm out of here. - You can't run.
the hell I can't!
don't be stupid. You'll go back to prison for violating your parole.
I made a promise.
you know what your boy needs more than a promise? He needs his dad.
now, let me handle this.
and when I'm done, you'll neverhave to worry about timo again. Trust me.
you okay? - Yeah.
you need to get rid of those.
where you going?
to relieve myself. Why? You want to watch?
you better give me your phone. - What?
we'll take nothing traceable.
sending messages in the middle of an operation is among the most dangerous things you can do.
sometimes you just have to drop a note and hope your backup team is paying attention.
they're doing the heist now.
we don't have much time.
I was wondering when the fun would start.
yeah?
monteiro heating & air?
finally. Tell them to hurry up.
took you long enough?
Hey,
where to?
it's right this way.
move it! Get going!
let's go! Move it! Let's go.
come on! Let's go. Get in there!
get your ass down here! Move!
get in there! Come on!
let's go.
19 minutes.
what's going on? - Are we in?
five more minutes.
we don't have five minutes! All right, pack up! We're gettingout of here!
let's go, let's go, let's go! Everybody out!
I want back to base! Everybody back to base!
do not be late! You got 33 minutes!
I want the place cleaned out of your clothes.
I got rdx. I can blow the lock.
like you said, it's the score of a lifetime.
it's too late. Two more minutes, and we all go to jail. Now, let's go!
that was a total waste of time! - You missed something! You had to!
whoa, this is not on me! My information was good!
you said that there was no panic button and no alarm on the safe!
and I was right!
then how did the alarm go off?
I don't know! - Exactly!
Hey, what's going on?
why are you guys so serious? What's going on?
we put too much time and work into this job to walk away with nothing.
what do you mean, nothing? I got the stuff.
it was in the bag. I gave it to Timo.
the jewels were in that bag? - Yeah. Where's Timo?
he should be here. I gave him the quickest route.
a certain kind of leader insists on controlling every aspect of an operation...
so that nothing can possibly go wrong.
the downside to insisting on controlling everything is that, when something bad happens, people tend to think it was all part of your plan.
he set us up.
son of A...
what did you get me into?
I'm gonna find Timo, and I'm gonna kill him!
I'm gonna kill him!
Oh, he'll be dead long before you find him.
where you headed? - Geez! Kandi.
what happened?
you tell me.
I don't know. Maybe somebody got onto us. Maybe C. J.Screwed it up.
what the hell are you doing here? We can't be seen together when a job is blown.
I had to make sur eyou were okay.
no, no, you get somewhere, and you stay there until you hear from me.
what about the jewels?
what jewels? What are you talking about? We didn't get anything.
whoa, what are you, crazy?
I will count to 3. - Kandi.
1... - what's wrong, baby?
2... - no. No!
sorry about the shiner. I had to sell it.
small price to pay.
think I'm really done hearing from Timo?
you know Kandi better than I do.
thanks for everything, Michael.
and I'm gonna be back tomorrow with that bracelet and some jewels for your friends, too.
that is not necessary.
Hey, I'll be back tomorrow.
Trevor, we didn't actually steal anything.
so the promisethat you made.
Yeah.
Thanks, man.
let's go.
almost done.
why the rush, Michael?
your little window forgetting into Carla's building doesn't open for over an hour.
I don't want to take any chances.
you really think you're gonna find something in that office?
no idea. Maybe I'll hit the jackpot and find out her real name and social security number.
or might find out what kind of staples she likes.
either way, it's more than what I have now.
you mean, nothing. - Exactly. Let's go.
five more minutes, they'll be dry.
now you're gonna have to do the mall over again. Let's go.
Hey, Mike. - Hey, Sam.
uh, what's with the bags?
Oh, well, uh, my little confession to Veronica didn't go over so well.
she kicked me out, Mike.
out of her place and out of her life.
thanks for the advice, Fi.
that's really sad, Sam.
but we can't talk about it right now. We're in such a rush, right, Michael?
who wants a beer?
are Carla's boys out of sight?
everybody but the guy in the coffee shop.
that's your decoy.
he thinks we're having a rendezvous in the alley.
you're welcome.
back in a few, Fi.
Michael, nice try.
your day job does get in the way, doesn't it?
when you work in intelligence, there's no bigger slap in the face than a picture of yourself in the middle of an operation.
it sends a clear message
we're one step ahead of you. We're in control. We own you.
mylar balloons and a bottle of champagne?
that's just twisting the knife.
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they deaide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-Happy ex-Girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies - - A bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line- Until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
your arms-dealer friend couldn't just meet us at the Caf? Carlito?
he wanted to meet here. I bought an assault rifle from him last year.
he doesn't know you. Seymour has trust issues.
I don't want to date him, Fi.
I just want to find out what the people who burned me are doing with a Russian sniper rifle.
and Seymour's the perfect guy to track it down. He's just a little... Eccentric.
when you work with people, you want to know everything about them...
their history, their associates, who's contacting them.
that Seymour?
that... That Seymour?
Oh, no. This guy I met. He just asked me out.
although sometimes there are details you'd rather not know.
Fiona, baby, good to see you.
Michael, right?
Hey, man. Heard a lot about you.
Seymour ARMS DEALER
come on. We're going for a walk.
Fiona, keep jackass company. He'll like you. He's attracted to shiny objects.
so, Fi tells me you want a gun.
rifle, actually. - Well, I got plenty. What do you need?
I got semi, automatic, European. - I need a dragunov, actually.
Wow. Yeah. Nice gun.
of course, there are not too many of them floating around.
how about a nice Romanian psl?
no, I'm not looking to buy, Seymour...
hold that thought. Hold that thought. I got some business I got to attend to here.
don't tell me. Don't tell me.
Vladimir, right? - Pavel.
anyway, you got my money?
I got to count it first.
so, what? They don't teach arithmetic in the Ukraine?
we're Bulgarian.
I don't even know what you just said.
the deal was 100 grand, okay? Not 50.
are you trying to rip me off?
nobody rips me off.
Wow. Fiona said you were a bad-ass.
this is really none of my business.
well, it is now. And this is the part where we haul ass.
no, no, no, no, no.
okay.
Michael, we'll talk later, okay?
let's go, Jackass!
punch it, man! They're shooting at us!
if you're driving a sports coupe, you're not going to be able to lose an off-road vehicle off road.
your best bet is to get them on the road, where you have the advantage.
it's less about speed than it is about maneuverability.
you need to put yourself in a position where you can do something that they can't.
okay, then, what about Gerda from east Berlin? - You kidding?
you remember her?
I wanted to invade the soviet bloc in 1983 just for her.
Hey, Mike. You remember Virgil.
Virgil former client
I brought us some tall cool ones.
I seem to recall you promising to stay out of Miami.
last time I saw you, there were people looking for you... Angry people with guns.
that's all blown over.
I was planning on staying away, but...
he needs help, Mike.
well, not for myself.
I had a partner in the repo business, a fella the name of Jay Flores.
he died several years back.
his daughter, Marcela, runs a medical-relief agency in town.
they got hit hard. Big shipment of medicine got ripped off.
Virgil's trying to track it down, and he needs some backup.
backup?
I figured that was in your wheelhouse.
she doesn't have anywhere else to turn.
can't hurt to talk to her, Mike.
mm, it could. It could hurt a little. Could hurt a lot.
come on. Gathering intel, lending tactical support to a worthwhile mission.
I mean, this is our old gig, mike. This is why signed up back in the day.
fine, I'll talk to her.
all right.
Oh, mind if I use your phone? I need to call Madeline.
Yeah, about that.
special lady.
there's a magnetic thing about her... Irresistible.
she offered to put me up, so I need to get on over th...
you'll stay here.
you tell her you can't make it and you'll call her when you're back in the Bahamas.
Mike, you serious?
last time you were in town, you nearly got her killed.
that's not going to happen again.
okay.
Mike, I'm telling you, you're not gonna regret this.
Marcela's done great things with this clinic.
they send medicine to kids in every country of the world that has diseases.
kick it, kick it!
Hey, no ball on the sidewalk.
he started it.
I see you brought the cavalry.
marcela THE CLIENT
listen, if anyone can find this stuff, it's these two.
we really need your help.
well, why don't you start by telling us what we're looking for.
we spent months on a fund-raiser for kids in Rio.
shipped nearly $1 million worth of medicine.
yesterday, an hour out of Miami, these guys, boarded the freighter, took everything.
well, unless they're starting a medical clinic, they're gonna want to sell this stuff.
whatever this stuff is worth on the black market, it's nothing compared to what it means to those kids.
if you can bring it back... - We'll see what we can do.
thank you so much, Michael.
I've been meaning to move these out here for ages.
any particular reason why you had to do everything today?
uh, just spring cleaning. You know.
so, have you heard from Virgil?
Virgil? - Yeah.
he called and said that, um, he was coming into town to see you and Sam.
you know Virgil... Just being Virgil.
I... Yeah, I got to...
yeah?
Mikey, good news. We got to head up to Boca.
got a lead on a guy who deals in black-market pharmaceuticals.
that could be our way in.
I was thinking we could head up there and check it out.
just the two of us?
Yeah, yeah. Virgil's gonna see some friends while he's here in town.
friends. Uh-huh.
Yeah, I think it would be better if I went with him to Boca.
okay, sure. That's a good idea.
it would be good for you guys to have some bonding time.
uh, listen, Virgil needs to ask you just a little favor.
listen, I didn't pack enough underwear, so I borrowed a set of your boxers...
the blue ones with the stripes.
they will never fit you. Stay out of my closets.
they're a little snug down under, but I got all packed in... Appreciate it.
Mike, be glad you didn't have to see that.
someone staying in the loft?
you don't say.
Yeah. I'm gonna go, mom.
that store there... It's owned by a guy named Feldman.
see, in the last few years, a bunch of ships have been robbed the same way.
thieves are in and out in five minutes.
they like to hit pharmaceutical shipments.
and this guy likes to buy them.
hell, he's a one-man pharmacy.
he got caught some time ago for selling vicodin taken off some boat in Naples.
charged with receiving stolen property, but his lawyer got him off.
doing a pretty brisk business now, it appears.
um, Michael, this thing with your ma and me...
I know you're a little uncomfortable about...
I'm not uncomfortable. You attract bullets. It's too risky.
come on. What's a few bullets?
um, you know what? I've got enough here.
I'll run down to the photo store, and then you and I can run in and raise a little hell.
can I help you?
Feldman DRUG DEALER
my friend here is looking for a five-iron.
graphite shaft, nothing too heavy.
and $1 million worth of high-grade pharmaceuticals stolen off a freighter a couple of days ago.
excuse me? I sell golf equipment.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Really? I mean, this is nice golf equipment.
but this store isn't paying for that porsche out back.
you are selling something else.
would you look at this.
who are you? What is this? - Quite a clientele.
banker, superior-court judge.
we thought we'd mail everybody a copy of their photo coming out of this store in one of these lovely, handsome frames...
all right, just stop.
this guy came by.
I sell viagra, vicodin, and... And tranqs.
what am I gonna do with $1 million worth of antivirals?
who is this guy?
his name's Gerard. He's a total psycho.
you are gonna call Gerard. You are going to tell him you have a buyer for his drugs.
no, no. That's insane. I can't... I can't call him.
what will the neighbors think? They've been living next to a drug dealer!
he seemed so nice. - All right, all right.
I'll get you a meeting.
and, um, throw in one of those shirts.
Yeah, sure.
well, it sounds like you and Virg made some progress. You found our thief.
Yeah. I'm told he's a total psycho.
you know, this is the reason why I don't look forward to virgil's visits.
one of the reasons.
listen, we're in the home stretch here.
we just got to get the medicine out in the open.
look, I'll run point, okay? I'll go in as a buyer.
fine. The sooner we get this done...
I'm all over it, Mikey.
you gonna hook up with Fi's, uh, arms-dealer friend? How's that going?
Yeah, another total psycho.
seymour, you might have mentioned we were going to a gun buy.
look, that Jackass I call a bodyguard... He's worthless.
so I figured you come along as backup, and I'd know for sure you're not a cop.
see? Kill two birds, right?
what's this?
you said you wanted a gun.
no, no, no. I wanted information about a sniper rifle.
Oh, right. The dragunov.
I mean, I could maybe import one from this guy in the czech republic.
no, I'm not looking to buy a sniper rifle, Seymour.
I just need to track down a place where someone can calibrate it.
do me a favor. Wave at that guy.
uh, if I'm not mistaken, that's one of the guys who shot at us.
he, uh, is bringing the rest of the money. See? 50 g's.
and why would I wave at him?
because I told him you and me. We don't have a beef with him anymore.
we... We, Seymour, do not have a beef with him.
you have a beef with him. - Whatever.
look, look, here he comes.
and he's not bringing your money. He has a gun. I'm not a part of this.
damn it. I told him. I talked to him.
for certain kinds of criminals, partying hard serves an important management function.
gerard THE THIEF
you can keep your eye on your employees during the off hours and keep them spending money...
...so they're hungry for the next score.
scotch and soda. - You Finley?
I am. - You're Gerard?
get out of here.
Yeah, Feldman said you'd be by. He didn't tell me a whole hell of a lot.
so, you're what, a gun dealer?
I deal in everything...
guns so people can shoot each other, medicine to get them ready for round two.
even Somali warlords need penicillin, my friend.
so, I hear you're in, uh, acquisitions.
hostile takeovers.
Ah. I got a client breathing down my neck for antivirals.
Feldman said you had a shipment to spare.
antivirals. That's bad timing. I sold those a couple hours ago.
well, that's a shame. I assume they haven't been delivered yet.
maybe they can be unsold. My client has deep pockets.
deal's done. We deliver next week.
excuse me a second.
why don't you calm down and go play with your boyfriend?
bar fights aren't just a way to blow off steam.
they're a great way to showcase your leadership skills, and they're a te-building exercise.
watch it, there. A broken bottle can hurt someone.
there's also no better way for someone new to get noticed.
okay, if this guy Gerard sold the medicine, what can we do?
maybe we could get the cops to sting the buy.
buyer shows up, cops swoop in.
we don't know when the delivery is.
and if the cops get involved, Gerard might find out.
no, forget it.
wait a minute. I got an in with this guy.
we can use that to find out where he's keeping this medicine.
we just need an inside man.
an inside man? What does that mean?
he wants me to join Gerard's crew so I can find out where he hides the stuff that he steals.
no, Sam, I can't.
Mikey, come on. Let me just pitch a whole new heist, something where he's got to bring you in.
we'll never actually have to do it.
it just has to look good, get him talking.
Virgil, can you get us a yacht?
you know, I think I probably can.
I helped a rich guy out in Fort Lauderdale...
sank his catamaran before his ex-wife could get it.
he might be in an accommodating frame of mind.
guys, you think you can find the medicine?
I have no idea, but we got to give it a shot.
Michael, you home?
you are not here.
aren't you gonna invite me in?
I'm hurry, ma. I'm going to meet Fi.
well, but I-I made you this.
you baked a pie?
okay, I just sprinkled cinnamon on it.
but I thought maybe you could share it with Sam...
and Virgil. - Virgil?
Michael, I may not be a superspy, but I'm not an idiot.
all right, I got a call from Virgil, saying some story bout being stranded in the Bahamas with boat trouble.
I mean, that wouldn't fool a 2- year-old.
so, what's going on?
nothing is going on. I have to go to work.
but if I hear rom Virgil, I'll let you know.
can I walk you to your car?
I can walk myself.
okay. I'll call you later.
keeping Virgil away from your mom is just about keeping her from danger?
what else would it be?
well, they did have a connection, Michael... A romantic connection.
an intimate, steamy connection.
I'm just saying, you know, when an important woman in your life meets someone, it can be an adjustment.
is this about your date? Because I'm fine with it.
I don't think so, Michael. Not one question about who he is?
you're not the least bit interested? - No, I'm not interested.
I thought spies were meant to be good liars. You are getting rusty.
Oh, hey, how you doing?
jackass, fruit smoothies for my friends.
that's all he's good for.
and lay off the wheat grass, will you?
Hey, guess what.
ThatUkrainian guy finally paid me my money, and here is your cut.
seymour, we don't work together. No more tests, no more buys, no more Bulgarians.
I just want information about where I can get a certain rifle serviced.
Oh, right, the dragunov. - Yes.
do you know anyone in Miami who would modify, calibrate it?
I just want a name and to keep it quiet.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll make some calls.
thank you.
but first, you got to have a fruit smoothie.
if you want to be a bad-ass, you got to eat healthy, right?
what? I made them just for you.
he doesn't like fruit?
I thought you and me...Bad-asses, yeah!
scotch and soda. Make it two.
nice to see you survived yesterday's little brawl.
some people don't understand their place in the food chain.
not afraid to get your hands dirty. I like that.
I got a job for you. - No, thanks. I don't do work for hire.
well, then consider yourself a partner in a very lucrative business opportunity.
what do you know about designer performance enhancers?
you mean like steroids? - More like steroids on steroids.
I know a lab that makes undetectable stuff... Next generation.
human tissue. 100% biological. It's worth millions.
they're, uh, running a shipment up north in a yacht.
you want us to hit it? - Shipment's worth $2 million.
you'd get a third. How does that sound?
a third sounds like work for hire. Half sounds like a partnership.
all right, done.
you handle the heist, but you got to bring in a pro to keep the drugs at the right temperature and humidity.
you got someone in mind? - Yeah.
he works at the lab. His name is Jackson.
he used to cook meth before he got into designing steroids.
you're gonna convince him to help.
convince him? - I'm sure you can be persuasive.
why don't you do it? - Me? Oh, no.
no, in my line of work, you stay in the shadows.
so the name Finley is never mentioned.
we clear on that, partner?
dealing with an aggressive adversary isn't always about showing strength.
you Jackson?
sometimes it's best to show weakness.
if they believe they can dominate you, they'll drop their guard.
as of course, that means getting dominated.
a heist? Seriously? No, no, no. I - I'm a chemist. I don't do heists.
guys with guns, violence... That's why I got out of meth! I mean, I-it's...
it's just not my thing. It makes my chest tight. I can't breathe.
op your breathing real quick.
please, you don't want to do this.
the guys that own the lab, they're chechnyans.
I mean, if they ever found out that I was in on it...
don't worry about it. They're not gonna know it was you.
can I get that as a guarantee? Can you put that in writing?
here's a guarantee.
you do this, we never see each other again, and you make some money.
you don't...
well, that's the guy that... That moves the stuff. He takes off in the morning.
how big's the cargo? - Uh, six cannisters. Not so big.
so, what do we need to do with them?
you got to pack it in coolers.
you got to get it inside a custom liquid-air rig asap, as soon as...
uh, because you let this stuff warm up, and it's is a nasty cocktail.
well, I can train one of your guys to move it off the boat.
one of my guys. You're the guy. - What?
no, no. I-I got a thing with boats a-and water, and I-I get...
I get I get seasick. I mean, look at me. Can you crack a window?
we'll scrounge up some dramamine. - Then they'll recognize my face.
we'll get you a mask.
all right, well, if we're gonna do this, man, then... Then I need to know where... Where this stuff's going, all right?
is it a warehouse? Is it a garage?
you don't need to know. We'll store it.
come on, I mean, uh, uh... Power issues, humidity.
have you been outside?
look, you tell me what you need, and we'll set you up, all right?
now, look at that. Old guy's got a girlfriend.
uh, can we, uh, can we go re, you know, somebody recognizes me?
I don't know who, but someone.
what are you doing here?
I followed you fromMichael's loft.
did Michael tell you to stay away from me?
look, Maddy, sweetie, listen, he's just looking out for you.
see, the thing is, I tend to attr and he just doesn't want you to get hurt.
well, you can tell Michael that I can take care of myself.
Madeline, I'm kind of in the middle of something right now, and you need to leave.
now.
please, madeline.
can I... Can I know about the storage space, the room temperature, the... The sunlight sensitivity?
I mean, we... We got to have these at a certain temp range.
I'll tell you what, you talk to Evan about what you need. We'll get it to you.
well, it's gonna take a while. - Take your time. You'll have all night.
you're staying with us till we pull this job tomorrow. Eaves your sight.
I got to call in sick. - You're not calling anybody.
what's gonna happen when I don't show up? I got to call the office.
I got to leave a message. I mean, they'll think something's wrong if I don't show up.
they'll think something's wrong.
one call. I'll be listening.
not a good time, Michael. I'm going to a movie.
Boris, it's it's Jackson.
Yeah. I'm not gonna make it into the office.
what's going on, Michael?
Yeah, yeah. the doc said thatt get out of bed.
uh, so, I came down with something.
so, uh, if you need anything, you can call me at ext
Hey, Fi.
michael just called me from a bar. Does the number 1820 mean anything to you?
Yeah, a place in the marina. Why?
I'm gonna miss my movie.
when you need to distract someone without raising suspicions, it helps to play to preconceptions.
tourists are fat, old people are cranky, and girls can't drive.
what the hell?
Oh, god. I'm so sorry.
I was putting on my makeup, and I didn't see you.
Oh, let me give you my insurance information.
so silly.
how about just your number, and we'll call it even.
you have a pen?
do you have a pen? - Sorry, nope.
do you have a pen?
they're not letting me leave. Tell Sam the fake heist is on for real now.
I missed my date. Thank you.
they're getting ready,Sam. How much longer?
we'll be there. We're just trying to do this right.
Mikey's donating his fridge to the cause.
it better look good. Gerard's got to believe the drugs he's stealing are real if he's gonna lead us to his stash.
look, we got it covered.
we're just trying to find a place to put Mike's yogurt while we do the job.
how's he doing?
fine. I wish they'd smack him around a bit.
I had to tell my date I got food poisoning.
come on, Fi, don't be like that.
I don't want him dead, just bruised.
hurry up. Looks like the show's starting.
counterfeiting pharmaceuticals is pretty straightforward.
fill some vials with your choice of beverage.
the trick is to keep people from looking closer.
with some compressed gas from your local farming-supply store and a few cryogenic containers, you can convince people that if they get a little too curious, they could lose a finger to frostbite.
where... W-where... Where's my mask? I need my mask.
you don't need one.
what are you talking about?!
I told you the guy on the boat will recognize me if I don't got a mask, so I need a mask!
let him. He can tell it s. the fishes.
the fish...? What are... You're gonna kill him?!
trust me, Jackson, it's better this way. No loose ends.
dealing with a trained operative is like playing chess with a master.
dealing with criminals, on the other hand, is like playing checkers with a 3-year-old.
they like to change the rules.
well, I need a gun. I need a gun. Give me a gun!
you said you didn't want one.
Yeah, well, that was before I knew people were gonna be shot.
and if you're gonna shoot people, they're gonna shoot back.
and if they shoot back, they'll probably hit me.
so I need a gun. I'm not going on the boat unless I...
you happy? - Yeah.
using a zodiac to catch a yacht has certain advantages.
it's low to the water, so it's hard to see coming.
it tops out at a brisk 60 miles per hour, and it's designed to turn on a dime.
of course, the one disadvantage is, it can make for a bumpy ride.
take anything you want... The boat, anything.
Where's the shipment?
sealed cannisters in the fridge. - Get to the bow.
find them.
Virgil, go with this.
you shut up! I don't even know what you're talking about. Shut up!
I've never met you before in my life.
did I miss something? - Yeah. He says he knows me.
..I do know you. You're that... That guy...
no, no! Shut up! Stop saying that!
everyone's gonna know you did this.
I don't know what you're talking about!
navy seals are trained to hold their breath for three to five minutes underwater.
if you're an ex-na probably still have the chops, but there's only one way to find out.
Oh, god, what ?
good for you. You broke your cherry.
Hey, do you want to lose a finger?! What's the matter? Put that down!
put that down!
you'll lose a finger you keep doing that.
you have not idea what you're doing.
this is my work, and I don't want it messed up by some idiots!
what did you say? - I said you're an idiot.
let it go. - Come on!
load them up.
load them up.
great.
we're gonna ge maybe even laid.
let's just make sure we get this stuff into storage. We can't let it spoil.
you know, I'm not gonna be responsible for this if, you know...
yoing about the storage space. You'll be fine with it.
I almost slipped.
looks like Mike's got them hooked pretty good.
now let's see if they lead us back to where they're hiding the antivirals.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
watch out for the fence. It's rusty.
there you go. Don't lose them, Fi.
I know how to tail a car.
well, there's no barbed wire, just one guard with a beretta, so getting in shouldn't be a problem.
we wait for Mike and Gerard and the guys to leave, and we'll make our move.
well, why not go in now?
because Mike could get hurt.
doesn't sound so bad.
what is this place?
big office-supply company uses it for inventory.
we got a guy on the inside, keeps us off the paperwork.
we got building security on the payroll, too.
aren't you, uh, you know, afraid someone might find your stuff?
in here? Good luck. Everything you need's right up here.
Oh, okay. All right, this will do. Ok.
okay, now, you're gonna have to have power sources clear because this thing will suck up a lot of juice.
okay? Yeah, oh, all right, good.
now, listen, uh, my rig will, uh, generate a lot of heat.
so if you have anything that's yours that's nearby that's pharmaceutical, it'll fry it.
is this yours? Any of this yours?
don't worry about it. All our other stuff's scattered around, nothing nearby.
Oh, yeah? Oh, good. Oh, good. Okay, so, then... Then, uh, yeah.
Yeah, that will work out.
I just need to go out to the van and, uh, get some tools.
give him a hand.
he's waving us off.
guess we're not going in, then.
Yeah, that's the warehouse he hides the medicine in.
but the medicine... It could be anywhere.
so we got to the end zone and no touchdown.
you want to search through 10, 000 boxes, be my guest.
sounds like the world's worst game show.
sorry about the fridge, Mike.
it was kind of a last-minute thing.
hungry?
look, I've got to do something. Where's that warehouse? I'm going down there.
maybe there's somebody I can know.
Virgil, it's not gonna work.
no. We...
...we got to get Gerard to move the medicine.
we do that, and we might be able to get it back.
you got any ideas? - Yeah.
I think it's time to bring back the mysterious Mr. Finley.
I like where you're going.
I just want my money.
can I have my money? Can I have my money, man?
I just want my money!
what the hell is wrong with you?
you said this was a simple heist. You never said Chuck Finley was involved.
so Finley's involved. What's the big deal?
what's the big... You have no idea, do you?! You don't get it.
Yeah, you don't get it. We're dead. We're dead. We are dead.
what are you talking about? He's the buyer.
Chuck Finley's the buyer? Oh, man. You don't get it. He comes in.
he gets you to bite on a job. He tells you a story. He say erything.
I got guns to shoot people up.
I got medical supplies to patch them up for round two.
I've never heard of him.
because everyone he's worked with is dead.
he's everywhere.
if the devil had a name, it'd be Chuck Finley.
who is he, and what do you know about him?
he did the same thing to a couple of guys I worked with out west.
he used to run black ops for the government.
assassination stealing secrets.
ust steals from people like you he takes what he wants, and he just leaves a trail of bodies.
he's not stealing from anybody. We got the warehouse.
you don't think he already knows about the warehouse?
are you kid...
and if he doesn't, he'll figure it out one way or another.
and not just this stuff. He's gonna take everything. He's gonna clean you out!
in... In fact, yeah, he's probably already done that. He's... He's gone.
I'd like to go. Give me my money. I'll get on a plane, a train, anything.
you're not going anywhere. You're gonna help us move the drugs.
no, no, no. I am not going back to that warehouse. Are you crazy?
are you...
you tell me.
Hello, police? I'm on the corner of 29th and 1st ave.
there are these men here with guns. I think they're drug dealers.
Oh, you have patrols in the area already? Thank goodness.
you need the police to respond right away, call ahead.
if you've reported a few minor crimes within a six-block radius, you can be sure someone will show up when you need them.
what's that? What... What are the boxes? What's that?
antiviral drugs.
Antiviral? I-I can't be responsible for that.
don't worry. You won't be. They're already sold.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. He's here. That's the guy.
we got to go!
one guy. - One guy?! You don't understand!
he's not alone. He must have guys in that truck.
we got to get out of here!
you're not going anywhere. Just load the stuff.
we'll take care of Finley and his guys.
most people think that shooting the gas tank of a vehicle makes it explode.
unless the car's on fire, you'll just spill a few bucks' worth of gas.
an explosion requires something extra, like a few bags of acetone peroxide taped to the gas tank.
you don't know what this means for us.
may I suggest that you fly the medicine next time?
what can I do to repay you?
uh, you know some guys who can help move a fridge?
my cooler doesn't hold much beer, Mike.
your daddy would have been so proud of you.
thank you.
Mike, I didn't call her. - I know.
michael told me what you were doing here in Miami, and it's a wonderful thing you did, Virgil.
I'm sorry about before. - It's okay.
dinner.
take her someplace nice. No guns.
you got it.
you know, Mike, if you had to have a stepdad, you could do worse.
Seymour has our information?
he didn't say. Just wanted us to stop by his place.
he sounded more paranoid than normal.
you missing a date for this?
Oh, don't flatter yourself.
Seymour promised to upgrade my laser-targeting assist.
said I could pick it up tonight. Should be quick.
I have no intention of missing any more dates.
OK beautiful, Fi.
so, this guy, is he nice? Your date?
Yeah, very.
him what'd you get me into?
I'm wondering the same thing.
who the hell are you, huh?
sniper rifle?
end gets a bullet in the head.
I'm not his girlfriend.
anyone who played soccer knows there's a long nerve that runs down the shin.
hit that nerve, and people lock up in pain.
arms dealers keep gunpowder handy in a bullet to be dangerous.
even muzzle flare can set it off.
so when dispersed through a room, anyone with half a brain puts his gun away.
no, no, no, no, no! Jackass Don't shoot! You'll blow us all up!
seymour, you want to tell me what that was about?
dude! Look!
that had done some work on the gun you're asking about.
the place was burned to the ground, man.
they killed the guy who owned it. All right?
I thought you were setting me up for something.
who brought the gun in, Seymour?
I don't know.
no, I swear, I swear.
all I know is some guy picked up some stuff for it, okay?
Specated muzzle brakes, night sights, and a fiber-optic camera.
that's all I know.
who's the guy? What's his name?
okay? That's all I know, I swear. Please don't hurt me.
we were never here, you understand?
I got it. I never saw you.
sorry about the dress, Fi.
I'm not. I targeting assists.
you think Johnson has something to do with the people who burned you?
I have to assume so. He's putting a fiber-optic camera on a sniper rifle.
that's for proof of death. We better find this guy.
now we've got his name, but he could be anywhere.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing.
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? -Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line, until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
when you have to get information about an enemy position, you have a choice.
you can watch from a distance, slow and safe.
or you can go inside and take a look.
quick, but potentially fatal.
Mike, I'm just saying.
for you to go waltzing in there, we don't have enough intel.
the people who burned me got a specialized rifle for a sniper, got him an access card for this building, and sent him to the conference room on the fourth floor.
that's a fair amount of intel.
Yeah, but we don't know what he was doing in there.
you might be walking into a hornets' nest.
chance I got to take.
what has he been doing since he was last here?
well, my fed buddy's been tracking his credit card.
your sniper's in Daytona, hitting all the strip clubs.
I mean, Mike, do you think he's just blowing off steam before he starts shooting?
could be.
you sure you want to do this?
they killed someone for this badge, and I went to a lot of trouble to steal it.
shame not to use it.
Hey, Mike, what are you seeing up there?
a mastermind petting a persian cat?
no, the floor's empty.
empty? Well, why were they so hot to get their sniper in there?
who knows?
hang on a sec.
most people think snipers like to shoot from ledges.
the fact is, the best sniper position is inside a room through an open window.
it hides the shooter, masks the report of a supersonic round, and makes the muzzle flash impossible to see.
it's a sniper perch.
he's scouting a perch, Sam.
well, what's he gonna shoot at, Mike?
the nearest building is, like, miles away, and the freeway's not an issue.
I think I found his target.
you better scoot. Your burn-notice lady just showed up.
burn-notice lady"?
Yeah, your overseer, boss, manager, whatever. Get out of there!
good news, Mikey.
I just planted a tracker on Carla's bike.
you had a tracker on you?
always be prepared --" Navy Seal motto.
that's boy scouts.
Mike, are you gonna argue with the man who just planted a tracker on your handler?
Sam, I could kiss you.
get in line.
Hey, Mikey.
to surveillance!
were you careful booking this place?
Yeah, don't worry. Carla's not gonna know we're watching.
costs a few bucks, but we're clean. Trust me.
you got to love it when you tail someone to a place that makes a good M ojito.
where is she now?
first chair all the way at the end.
tell me about Carla.
well, she's got a hell of a breaststroke, Mike.
I mean, the woman can swim. She's a machine.
good to know.
what about the assassination she's planning?
anything on that?
if the sniper's hitting someone on the ferry, you 're gonna have to ask tall, blonde, and evil down there who the target is 'cause there's no passenger list, and you got to buy a ticket on the day.
how about her security?
not much here at the hotel.
I don't think she wants to draw attention, so I've been working my sources and checking on her room.
Oh, Mike, um, did I mention that the drinks here are just a little bit pricey?
that should do it.
better not let Carla catch you with that access card.
you may need it later.
it's always a challenge hiding something sensitive that you might need quickly.
any hiding place involves a trade-off between security and access.
hiding something in the sewer main under your floor, and it's secure, but good luck getting to it.
hide something in your sock drawer, and it's easy to get to but hard to secure.
the best hiding places are easy to get to but tough to find.
the do-it-yourself versions are known in the spy trade as "slicks easy to slip something in, easy to slide it out."
and Campbell.
Michael... it's good to see you again.
got you a, uh, yogurt drink.
Fiona said you'd like it.
Campbell FIONA'S BOYFRIEND
thank you.
is this a social call?
Oh, I think we've "socialized" enough for one day.
it's purely business. Tell him.
campbell: Yesterday, a call came in about a guy passed out on the street, and my ambulance was the first one on the scene.
it was crazy. I mean, somebody had worked this guy over.
took a lot of blows to the stomach area.
he was coughing up blood.
I'd say this guy's in real trouble.
I was kind of hoping maybe you and Fiona could talk to him.
I know you guys help people.
Yeah, um, now is, uh...
well, the timing couldn't be worse.
Michael, Campbell almost got fired helping us with our last job.
it's okay, Fiona. I know it's a lot to ask.
if Michael's too busy, I'll handle it myself.
Fi, stop.
you shouldn't do this job alone.
so you're saying you'll talk to him? - Yes.
Oh, man, that is great. Thanks, Mike.
Henry THE CLIENT
I work for a company that does private bodyguard work.
and a few weeks ago, I met this guy lesher.
says he was a corporate headhunter.
he seemed like a good guy.
but when he started askingabout security procedures, I got suspicious, and I stoppedreturning his calls.
a few days later, my best friend, a guy that I've known since I was 10, they said he committed suicide.
I knew it wasn't true.
it didn't make any sense.
and then I got a call from Lesher.
and he said that more people will die if I don't cooperate or if I call the police.
they're planning a kidnapping. -Yeah.
they're going after thisVenezuelan family, the Arroyos.
oil money, I think.
whenever they come to Miami, they hire a bodyguard for each of the family members.
you know who Lesher's planning to take?
he wanted to know about the guard for the daughter, Isabella.
I told him I hadn't assigned a team yet.
he wanted files on allthe guards, and I said no.
and that's when he worked me over.
he wants the personnel files tomorrow.
the family --they get here in a few days.
I don't know what to do.
I'm gonna need those files and whatever else you have on the Arroyo family.
I remember when kidnapping used to be a mom-and-pop business.
everything's going corporate these days, Fi, even kidnapping.
Isabella needs a new bodyguard.
lucky me.
I guess I'll need a, uh, company personnel file.
I can do that.
give you a drinking problem, some money issues, ex-wife, couple kids.
you'll be the easiest target to get leverage on.
since when are you so enthusiastic about doing paperwork?
I just want to do a good job.
you like him that much, Fi? Campbell.
Yeah, maybe. What do you think of him?
he's nice.
listen, um...uh, I need to go over to my mom's for this family thing. I'll call you later.
Hey, Mike! Come on in!
why the celebration?
Nate's starting a limo company.
I figure, why should I drive someone else's car when I could just drive my own, right?
a-a limo company?
uh, do you even have a car?
he does now!
I took a loan out on the house.
okay, look, bro, I know what you're thinking.
you let mom take a loan out on the house?
he didn't let me do anything. I wanted to help him.
mom, what if --if he screws it up?
Nate, I'm just saying. Nate!
no, I know what you were saying. I-I deserve that.
enjoy the champagne.
Nate worked really hard on this.
couldn't you support him a little?
mom, given his track record, if things go wrong
well, it's off to a really good start, Michael.
thanks a lot.
guess I'll let myself out.
it's all right, henry. There's no one around.
Lesher called again.
he wants those files.
and you're going to give them to him.
he's going to go through the files and make you choose a guard for Isabella that he think she can control.
and it's you?
how do you know he'll pick you?
I've kind of done this thing before, Henry.
a recently divorced alcoholic with money problems
he'll open my file and think it's christmas morning.
and then?
then I let slip some information that convinces him this kidnapping isn't worth the trouble.
is there anything I can do?
just play ball.
it's my job to make him walk away from the game.
Fiona: He looks a little jittery.
you think he'll hold it together?
fear is the greatest motivator.
Oh, I don't know about that.
look at why you're doing this.
what does that mean?
well, you wanted to protect me.
what are you doing it for?
I wanted to make Campbell happy.
here we go. That must be lesher.
Lesher HIDNAPPER
and the muscle.
the MUSCLE
he better go for it.
if I did all that paperwork for nothing, I'm gonna shoot someone.
when an operative recruits someone, he lets the target make the first move.
he'll dress like him, drink like him, move like him, but he won't talk to him.
he'll wait to be approached.
I'm not sayings he deserved nothing, but half?
I mean, if I'd knownwe were gonna get divorced, I would have had hercome to the office and do half my job, know what I'm saying?
besides, after I pay a lawyer and get a new place, what am I left with?
squat. - Exactly.
you want to hear a funny story about my divorce?
sure. - Me too.
another round --on me.
to my friend at the end of the bar.
I'm not asking for too much, okay?
um, well, just, you know, just come back. That's all I'm asking, but just a wife who doesn't just get on my ass about, you know, "stop drinking" all the time, "come to church" all the time. For Christ's sake.
you know, a decent job, a decent paycheck -- is thattoo much to ask for?
so, you never told me.
what exactly do you do, Brad?
special forces, you know, officer -- 15 years.
now I carry a tennis bag for a spoiled little rich girl.
I work for a bodyguard company.
it's a joke. How about you?
well, it's not too far from your line of work.
I do security testing.
Ah, what a coincidence! You ex-military?
I spent some time in the service, yeah.
you should really think aboutcoming into my side of the biz.
Nah, it's all just B.S. You know?
think about it.
I mean, what kind of training do they do at your company?
when selling yourself as a traitor, you can't be too eager.
a good op will walk away from a recruitment that seems to good to be true.
that's confidential. Why are you asking me these questions?
I'm sorry.
if I want to offer you a job, I should just come out and say so.
I just think it's a shame to see a man with your talents wasted on a job that's beneath him.
if you're interested, give me a call tomorrow.
surveillance is the leading cause of weight gain among operatives.
in a job that's equal parts boredom and tension, eating is a way to pass time and calm nerves.
whatever Carla's up to, Mike, it's something big.
lots of meetings, international types, nobody we know.
if you want to get in her room, now would be the time.
sure, I'll just, uh, teleport myself over there.
or do you have a better suggestion?
you could use this master key.
I cozied up to the housekeeping manager.
Mike, the stuff I had to do to get that, you don't even want to know.
whatever you had to do, it was worth it.
what's the security like in Carla's room?
she's got a facial-recognition computer at the door.
anybody unauthorized sets off an alarm.
that's the room-service guy.
he's authorized.
call me if Carla makes a move and order yourself some dessert. You earned it.
I'm all over it, buddy.
it doesn't have to be food, right?
facial-recognition systems are often used to replace human guards since they're cheap, they don't sleep, and they can't be bribed.
they have a big weakness, though.
unlike guards, computers can't tell the difference between a photocopy of a face and a face.
when you search a spy's room, you don't waste time checking the safe.
you have to assume they're as creative as you are.
slicks come in all shapes and sizes.
Yeah, Sam.
Carla's meeting's wrapping up, Mike. Time to go. Find anything?
we hit the jackpot.
looks like you found Carla's whole file on this operation, Mikey.
Yeah, but the name of the sniper's target is not in there.
well, maybe the supreme overlords haven't given it to her yet.
so if you get it before carla, that might be enough to get you off the blacklist.
worth a try.
well, there's some familiar faces in here.
you know who this is? - No.
maybe he's another operative.
I think we're getting close, Mikey.
well, I got to get back to the hotel.
I'll let you know if she makes a move.
Thanks, Sam.
Hey, go easy on the Mojitos.
they always go easy on me.
the Arroyo family arrived in town yesterday.
you were right.
Lesher asked me to put you on Isabella's security.
you're gonna take her from the house to the country club.
here's your key.
that's your car right out there.
you're doing fine, Henry. Just try to relax.
Lesher's asking for a schedule.
and you're gonna give it to him.
you're gonna keep cooperating with him.
Henry, Lesher's gonna geta whole lot of information about Isabella's security tonight, and he's not gonna like what he hears.
there's an art to drinking without getting drunk.
start with a lot of ice to dilute the alcohol.
order a new round before you're done so your half-full drink gets taken away.
and, of course, spill.
no -- no worries. I got it.
you want to talk business, let's talk business.
Yeah, we deal with high-end clients.
we're always looking for good people... like you.
I know your time's valuable, so I'll make it worth your while to hear me out.
a thousand bucks.
just for considering my offer.
here's the deal, Brad.
if I'm gonna hire you, I need to see you in action.
and I know it's against regulations, but I'm in a bit of a bind here.
you got to work with me a little.
check me out tomorrow when I drive little miss sunshine to her tennis match.
but be careful that you're not seen.
they always hire extra security.
extra security aside from you?
they got two more guys locked an loaded -- watchers watching the watchers.
can you believe that? For one girl.
two more cars. Seriously?
see for yourself.
they got more money than sense. Another drink. Another drink?
why not?
princess.
this job sounds good.
Hey, do you think you could drop me off at the Hilton?
I got kicked out of --you know, amanda -- she kicked me outof staying there.
can you... - yeah, no problem. No problem.
Yeah. All right.
a cover I.D. That involves drinking comes with a price.
but the tactical advantages make the hang over worth it.
how'd it go with lesher?
told him about the security, and I got a bug in his car.
time for a demonstration of Isabella's air-tight detail.
Sam's in the buick. Who's the other member of our little team?
I was thinking about calling Nate.
I was hoping you couldmonitor the bug from here.
you're asking your brother for help on the job?
I'm trying to be supportive.
fi... is that my last yogurt?
there's some tuna tahini in the oven.
your favorite.
Campbell made it.
he's so grateful you're helping Henry.
you know me --anything for Campbell.
by the way, you never told me what you thought of him.
Oh, no, I told you.
no, he's nice.
I'm just gonna go outand pick up some yogurt. Be right back.
Hello?
Carla, so good to hear from you.
I got an interesting report today.
someone used a key card to get into a certain office building.
know anything about that?
key card? All the key cards I had, I gave to you.
is that so?
but if I hear anything, you're my first call.
let me get a pen. What's your number?
word of advice -- there are things in the works that are far, far over your head.
stay out of them or there will be consequences.
you know me --good little soldier.
good night, Michael.
Mike, you want some of these?
they got plenty of them. Mints, too.
I mean, they keep restocking the room. It seems a shame to waste them.
so I tried to get ears on her with the directional Mike, but whenever they're out in the open, it's just small talk.
she's good at what she does.
so she called you, huh?
do you think she knows anything?
maybe. Maybe not. It doesn't change much.
we still have to watch and learn.
at least she's locked down tight here.
tight enough that I can borrow you to be my extra bodyguard?
Yeah, sure, if we make it quick.
I can get back before she's done swimming.
at least try the shampoo, Mike.
it smells really good.
welcome. - Thank you.
I got to be honest with you, bro.
I didn't expect you to call me with a limo job.
you didn't seem too hot on the idea.
as someone who has lent you money in the past, I was a little concerned.
I'm not gonna screw this up, Mike. I want you to know that.
I'm turning things around.
all right, so I just drive up the street, and then I look at youand some girl.
are you sure that's all you want me to do?
that's it. Just sit there and don't smile.
not exactly what I expected for my first job.
it's more important than taking people to the airport. Trust me.
you know what?
I'm gonna frame this.
well, maybe I'm gonna break this up into smaller bills and frame one of them.
but, uh...
Thanks, Mike.
operatives do a lot of bodyguard work.
on any given day, the average commando is more likely to be watching a V.I.P. walk his dog than engaging the enemy in battle.
not glamorous, but part of the job.
you're...
thanks for drive me.
no problem. No, uh... problemo.
so serious.
how was tennis? -Fine.
what's wrong, Fi?
I'm listening to the bug in Lesher's car.
they were impressed with the extra security, but this is more than a kidnapping for money. Listen.
it doesn't matter. It does matter!
they got both sides of the street covered! The plan was that...
I know what the plan was!
but the people that paid for this job have a multinational oil concession riding on us getting that girl.
we have to find a way.
sounds like Lesher needs a little more convincing.
Michael, you don't have to
Fi...we both know I have to.
did you see me in action today?
Yeah, I saw you. -Yeah, and how many others?
I mean, you could send a delta force team after that kid, and you wouldn't even scratch her tennis racket.
I mean, it's a waste of my time.
uh, when can istart with you? -Yeah, we need to talk.
can we start talking about salary?
cause if I'm gonna make a move, I got to give notice. Who's your friend?
that's what this talk's about, my man. -What are you doing?
you want a new job? I'll give you a new job.
you're gonna help us take the girl.
no, no, no. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, Brad!
you cashed my check.
how's that gonna look for your company? Or to the cops?
I own you, Brad. You're mine.
Oh, god! I can't do this.
we just need the girl.
you need to get her away from the other security team.
you're gonna get her isolated, hand her over to us, and you can walk away.
I-I-I can't do that.
you need to do as you're told, or life's gonna get real short real quick for your ex and your kids up in Orlando.
now, do you understand me?
Yeah. I understand.
thought you would.
just hold still.
so, what's happening?
Lesher's gonna take Isabella?
I thought there was a plan.
this isn't just a snatch-and-grab for kidnapping insurance.
someone's putting the pressure on her father's oil business. There's a lot at stake.
so that's it?
I mean, he's just gonna take her, and there's nothing we can do?
uh, it's trickier now, Henry, but I'm hoping I can still get him to call it off.
how?
well, if lesher thinks Michael's gonna blow the job, go to the cops, then hopefully he'll decide there's no way he can pull it off.
but he said he'd kill you.
I know.
I just have to make him believe that I don't care.
have you been drinking?
a little. A little.
I just -- I can't sleep, and with my divorce and now what's, what's going on with this, it's -- I just can't take much more of it.
would you shut up and pay attention?
I'm gonna be parked right there.
you bring that girl out of the club five minutes early, and we'll grab her before the other security team gets here.
what if she runs?
she's not gonna run. We're gonna drug her, all right?
day after tomorrow, she'll be out of the country.
well, what about the other security detail showing up early?
just make sure they don't, Brad.
if anything happens...
I mean anything, you're dead.
anybody who runs a few assets knows that some crack under the pressure.
you have to be tough enough to keep them in line, supportive enough to keep them stable.
let me help you with that.
I don't know if I can do it.
I-I just... -Here you go.
I-I don't think it's in me.
it's a piece of cake, man. It's a piece of cake.
just buck up. - No, no, I-I-I can'T.
you just -- - Brad!
trust me. This is not my thing.
go home. Sober up.
you can do this. Here's your top.
Yeah, Sam?
Yeah, Mike, I got some news.
you know how my FBI buddy was tracking Carla's sniper, running his cards?
Yeah.
well, the bar crawl is over. He's back in town.
and our girl Carla has had a very busy meeting schedule this morning, so I think the sniper's gonna be doing his thing soon.
keep me posted.
will do.
and, Mike, you better wrap up this kidnapper business, eh?
I'm trying, Sam. I'm trying.
when someone turns you into an asset, their main weapon is fear.
is Brad the security guard ready to change his life?
just about.
if you fear poverty or exposure or death, that's what they use against you.
their worst nightmare, then, is an asset with no fear.
Lesher, it's Brad.
are you drunk?
why are you calling me now?
it's 3: 00 in the morning. What the hell are you.
I'm not doing it.
I'm not helping you kidnap that girl.
what? Brad, we went over this.
I couldn't sleep tonight.
so I came down, I started watching tv, and there was this bible program on.
and it was like -- it was likethey were speaking to me.
and suddenly I realized for the first time, you know? I saw.
wait. What -- the Bible?
they said this thing as iron sharpens iron, so man sharpens another man.
and I realized, proverbs 27: 17.
that's you and me.
you showed me the way.
have you been drinking?
no, I'm done with that.
no more drinking. No more hate.
you, guys at work, my ex-wife -- you're all angels sent to test me.
what are you talking about? Brad.
the kidnapping --I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna help you kidnap that girl.
I see that now. It was all a test.
Brad, listen to me!
you breathe one word of this, and you're dead.
don't you see I'm not afraid?
I'm not afraid anymore. I'm not afraid of death. I'm not afraid of anything.
I'm free.
we should meet.
listen to me carefully, Brad.
you're in this.
you're a part of this already.
if this gets out, I will be punished. I know.
I accept that.
what is this? A confession?
it's my sins -- our sins.
like they say, "yea, though I walk through the valley ofthe shadow of death...
shut up! Shut up! Shut up! - ..."I will fear no evil.
I will fear no evil, for you are with me.
you want to kill me, kill me. Do it. Do it. I deserve it. I deserve it.
and all these people will bear witness to my sacrifice.
I am ready to be judged.
forget it.
forget it. Forget it. We call it off.
it was a test, all right?
I'm an angel, I was testing you, and you passed.
just go home. It's over.
blowing an operation is a delicate business.
you have to convince your opponent to abandon his plans, make a case that the smart move is to just pack up and go home.
problem is, even when you do your job well, people don't always go with the smart move.
Lesher sent you to kill me, didn't he?
well, then, you need to make a phone call.
you're gonna tell him you did the job, but you got hurt and you had to go to the hospital.
then... you're gonna spend a little time in your trunk.
how does that sound? Hold that thought.
yeah?
Michael, it's Henry.
I just got a call from Lesher.
the kidnapping's on for this afternoon.
he made me assign a new security guard.
he's going to kill the guy, and he wants me to help him.
I'm supposed to meet them at the country club.
I get the guard away from Isabella, saying that there's, there'sa mix-up at headquarters, and then Lesher, he drives up, he's gonna grab her while the other guy shoots the guard!
I'm not gonna let that happen. Calm down.
calm down?
I'm supposed to meet him in half an hour.
and you still will.
Henry, Lesher still has to believe you're cooperating.
if you try anything right now, he's got every reason to kill you and no reason to keep you alive.
I don't think I can -- - yes, you can. Listen to me.
I'm gonna take care of this.
you just do what they say. And when you see me, Henry, run.
run... when I see you.
when you see me. - Okay.
you ready?
they're gonna be here soon.
I still don't like this. I mean, what do you...
you don't have to like it. You just have to do it.
she's here.
who is that? Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
get her inside now!
go!
you thought you could kill me?
I gave you a chance to be redeemed!
but you turned your back!
these are your sins, Lesher, here on this paper!
do you hear them coming?
they will find everything you've brought to kidnap that poor girl!
and you will be judged!
I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't responded to that 911 call.
thank you. Really.
they did all the heavy lifting, so...
well, whoever Lesher was working for must have been pretty disappointed.
I heard he tripped and fellon a knife last night in jail.
he fell on a knife?
you're safe, Henry.
but I'd keep your mouth shut about all of this.
no problem. The family's keeping this really quiet.
they're really stepping up the security.
Oh, Isabella -- she's been asking why you're not around anymore.
what do I tell her?
tell her Brad the security guard had to take some time off for some personal issues.
so, what do you think of Campbell? You still haven't told me.
why is it so important what I think about your boyfriend?
cause I want you to like him.
I'm happy that he makes you happy.
give me a real answer, Michael. Saved by the phone.
Yeah, ma?
Madeline: Michael, what is going on?
what do you mean? What's wrong?
there are cops here, and they're arresting your brother!
ma, I didn't do anything! I swear! Tell him.
they said it's about this limo company, t-that I-it's some kind of a front laundering money or something. It's ridiculous!
tell him not to say anything.
Michael, I got a call from some woman.
a-and she said that --that nate is in serious trouble.
I could lose my house.
and -- and she said, Michael, to tell you that you should stay out of other people's business.
her name was, um, Carla.
I'm gonna call you back.
Sam, is Carla there?
just about to call you, brother.
something's up. She's on the move.
I need a ride.
well, there's our mystery operative.
any idea what's going on, Sam?
no, she just checked out of the hotel and came over here. That's it.
just say the word, Michael. I have a nice rifle in the trunk of my car.
tempting, but since she's the only one who knows what's going on, I might want to keep her alive.
there's a reason they call the spy trade the hall of mirrors.
you can never know for sure whether you're in control or you're being played.
but if you do it long enough, you learn to trust your instincts.
it's a setup.
what? -What are you saying?
she knows we're here.
she's gonna have her sniper take his target out now.
she wants me here watching when it happens.
how can you be sure, Mike?
I can't, but it's how I would do it.
last ferry's in an hour.
if I can get home and get that access card, I can get to the sniper before he takes his shot.
sounds good. I'll get to his house, see if I can catch him there.
still leaves me free to shoot Carla.
just saying.
as soon as I leave, they'll be on me. Can you?
Yes, I can.
unlike cars, motorcycles don't have much of an aftermarket in stolen parts.
so antitheft measures are outdated and easy to get around.
the steering lock on a smaller bike breaks fairly easily.
then it's just a matter of getting away.
go.
when you're tailed by multiple vehicles, you're at a disadvantage.
they can flank you, take alternate routes, box you in.
it helps to have a team of you're own.
the electronic stability program was originally developed to help keep cars from sliding on icy roads.
but it's a great tool for the precision driver.
when you need to slide, you can simply turn it off and turn it on again when you need to maneuver.
a semi has about 4 feet of clearance under it.
sliding beneath it on a motorcycle is possible, but risky.
too low, and the pavement will grind you to a pulp.
too high, and any part of your body that hits the trailer will no longer be part of your body.
Yeah, Sam?
I'm home. Did you make it to the sniper's house?
Yeah, I got some news, Mikey. The sniper's dead.
dead? Why would anyone...
I don't know, but it's pretty nasty.
something is very wrong.
I don't get what's going on.
they went to a lot of trouble to put this guy in place.
slow down. Just tell me.
what happened, Sam? How?
someone booby-trapped his front door, Mike.
they blew him up.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing.
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? -Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line, until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
when you have to get information about an enemy position, you have a choice.
you can watch from a distance, slow and safe.
or you can go inside and take a look.
quick, but potentially fatal.
Mike, I'm just saying.
for you to go waltzing in there, we don't have enough intel.
the people who burned me got a specialized rifle for a sniper, got him an access card for this building, and sent him to the conference room on the fourth floor.
that's a fair amount of intel.
Yeah, but we don't know what he was doing in there.
you might be walking into a hornets' nest.
chance I got to take.
what has he been doing since he was last here?
well, my fed buddy's been tracking his credit card.
your sniper's in Daytona, hitting all the strip clubs.
I mean, Mike, do you think he's just blowing off steam before he starts shooting?
could be.
you sure you want to do this?
they killed someone for this badge, and I went to a lot of trouble to steal it.
shame not to use it.
Hey, Mike, what are you seeing up there?
a mastermind petting a persian cat?
no, the floor's empty.
empty? Well, why were they so hot to get their sniper in there?
who knows?
hang on a sec.
most people think snipers like to shoot from ledges.
the fact is, the best sniper position is inside a room through an open window.
it hides the shooter, masks the report of a supersonic round, and makes the muzzle flash impossible to see.
it's a sniper perch.
he's scouting a perch, Sam.
well, what's he gonna shoot at, Mike?
the nearest building is, like, miles away, and the freeway's not an issue.
I think I found his target.
you better scoot. Your burn-notice lady just showed up.
burn-notice lady"?
Yeah, your overseer, boss, manager, whatever. Get out of there!
good news, Mikey.
I just planted a tracker on Carla's bike.
you had a tracker on you?
always be prepared --" Navy Seal motto.
that's boy scouts.
Mike, are you gonna argue with the man who just planted a tracker on your handler?
Sam, I could kiss you.
get in line.
Hey, Mikey.
to surveillance!
were you careful booking this place?
Yeah, don't worry. Carla's not gonna know we're watching.
costs a few bucks, but we're clean. Trust me.
you got to love it when you tail someone to a place that makes a good M ojito.
where is she now?
first chair all the way at the end.
tell me about Carla.
well, she's got a hell of a breaststroke, Mike.
I mean, the woman can swim. She's a machine.
good to know.
what about the assassination she's planning?
anything on that?
if the sniper's hitting someone on the ferry, you 're gonna have to ask tall, blonde, and evil down there who the target is 'cause there's no passenger list, and you got to buy a ticket on the day.
how about her security?
not much here at the hotel.
I don't think she wants to draw attention, so I've been working my sources and checking on her room.
Oh, Mike, um, did I mention that the drinks here are just a little bit pricey?
that should do it.
better not let Carla catch you with that access card.
you may need it later.
it's always a challenge hiding something sensitive that you might need quickly.
any hiding place involves a trade-off between security and access.
hiding something in the sewer main under your floor, and it's secure, but good luck getting to it.
hide something in your sock drawer, and it's easy to get to but hard to secure.
the best hiding places are easy to get to but tough to find.
the do-it-yourself versions are known in the spy trade as "slicks easy to slip something in, easy to slide it out."
and Campbell.
Michael... it's good to see you again.
got you a, uh, yogurt drink.
Fiona said you'd like it.
Campbell FIONA'S BOYFRIEND
thank you.
is this a social call?
Oh, I think we've "socialized" enough for one day.
it's purely business. Tell him.
campbell: Yesterday, a call came in about a guy passed out on the street, and my ambulance was the first one on the scene.
it was crazy. I mean, somebody had worked this guy over.
took a lot of blows to the stomach area.
he was coughing up blood.
I'd say this guy's in real trouble.
I was kind of hoping maybe you and Fiona could talk to him.
I know you guys help people.
Yeah, um, now is, uh...
well, the timing couldn't be worse.
Michael, Campbell almost got fired helping us with our last job.
it's okay, Fiona. I know it's a lot to ask.
if Michael's too busy, I'll handle it myself.
Fi, stop.
you shouldn't do this job alone.
so you're saying you'll talk to him? - Yes.
Oh, man, that is great. Thanks, Mike.
Henry THE CLIENT
I work for a company that does private bodyguard work.
and a few weeks ago, I met this guy lesher.
says he was a corporate headhunter.
he seemed like a good guy.
but when he started askingabout security procedures, I got suspicious, and I stoppedreturning his calls.
a few days later, my best friend, a guy that I've known since I was 10, they said he committed suicide.
I knew it wasn't true.
it didn't make any sense.
and then I got a call from Lesher.
and he said that more people will die if I don't cooperate or if I call the police.
they're planning a kidnapping. -Yeah.
they're going after thisVenezuelan family, the Arroyos.
oil money, I think.
whenever they come to Miami, they hire a bodyguard for each of the family members.
you know who Lesher's planning to take?
he wanted to know about the guard for the daughter, Isabella.
I told him I hadn't assigned a team yet.
he wanted files on allthe guards, and I said no.
and that's when he worked me over.
he wants the personnel files tomorrow.
the family --they get here in a few days.
I don't know what to do.
I'm gonna need those files and whatever else you have on the Arroyo family.
I remember when kidnapping used to be a mom-and-pop business.
everything's going corporate these days, Fi, even kidnapping.
Isabella needs a new bodyguard.
lucky me.
I guess I'll need a, uh, company personnel file.
I can do that.
give you a drinking problem, some money issues, ex-wife, couple kids.
you'll be the easiest target to get leverage on.
since when are you so enthusiastic about doing paperwork?
I just want to do a good job.
you like him that much, Fi? Campbell.
Yeah, maybe. What do you think of him?
he's nice.
listen, um...uh, I need to go over to my mom's for this family thing. I'll call you later.
Hey, Mike! Come on in!
why the celebration?
Nate's starting a limo company.
I figure, why should I drive someone else's car when I could just drive my own, right?
a-a limo company?
uh, do you even have a car?
he does now!
I took a loan out on the house.
okay, look, bro, I know what you're thinking.
you let mom take a loan out on the house?
he didn't let me do anything. I wanted to help him.
mom, what if --if he screws it up?
Nate, I'm just saying. Nate!
no, I know what you were saying. I-I deserve that.
enjoy the champagne.
Nate worked really hard on this.
couldn't you support him a little?
mom, given his track record, if things go wrong
well, it's off to a really good start, Michael.
thanks a lot.
guess I'll let myself out.
it's all right, henry. There's no one around.
Lesher called again.
he wants those files.
and you're going to give them to him.
he's going to go through the files and make you choose a guard for Isabella that he think she can control.
and it's you?
how do you know he'll pick you?
I've kind of done this thing before, Henry.
a recently divorced alcoholic with money problems
he'll open my file and think it's christmas morning.
and then?
then I let slip some information that convinces him this kidnapping isn't worth the trouble.
is there anything I can do?
just play ball.
it's my job to make him walk away from the game.
Fiona: He looks a little jittery.
you think he'll hold it together?
