you will notice that the waffle pattern on the epidermis of the wound matches exactly the one on the car.
I will not let you continue t-t-to treat us like this is disgusting and unfair to my daughter. - How can you show this to us?
to prove the same tool that was used on your daughter's car was also used to kill your son.
that is the mark that this hammer makes.
Sergei was using one just like it to hammer out the dents in Theresa's car.
she came out to the garage while he was using it, grabbed it from his hand, and killed him.
what? - Brian, stop this.
Sergei cut your hair. He killed your cat.
he stole your car and wrecked it.
and in a fit of anger, you jerked this from his hand and smashed his head in!
I have a witness!
I never wanted Sergei to... - wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You have a witness?
you have a witness who saw Theresa kill my son?
he puts her in the garage while the hammer was being used.
and Theresa left two threatening messages on Sergei's cellphone yesterday at 7: 00 in the morning, - saying she intended to kill him. - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Theresa made those calls after Sergei was already dead.
how do you know when he died?
we were never able to establish a time of death.
but you bring up an excellent point.
only people who thought Sergei was still alive would bother calling him on his cell.
there were two messages from Theresa and one from Jason Hetner, but not one from you or your wife. And why?
because you knew he wouldn't answer!
dad? Dad, what is she talking about? - It's okay. It's okay.
lieutenant Tao, would you please escort Theresa out of the room?
come with me, dear.
go ahead, honey. We'll be out in a minute.
go ahead. - It's okay.
this way.
so, sit down. Let's talk.
you called 911.
you thought that someone would just pop over and take a quick report.
you were stunned at our reaction.
you came down here to find out how close we were to actually finding something.
you did everything you could to point us in the direction of Jason.
well, those games are over now.
which one of you is the monster that killed your own son?
Sergei was the monster.
killing that dog was only the last in a long list of horrible, horrible things a list that starts with stuffing his pet hamsters in the garbage disposal, cutting up squirrels, killing cats, stepping on baby birds. And I...
I thought we could work with him, and I tried.
we took him to anger camps, to psychiatrists.
we sent him to boarding school, to -- to a military academy.
we even tried to return him to Russia, and they wouldn't take him back.
Susan, we can't hide what happened. - No, no, she does not understand!
Sergei's aggression was created by his biological mother, who abandoned him, or it was genetics or...
I mean, where else does that sort of violence come from?
maybe from parents who smashed him in the head with a hammer.
which one of you did that, or did you both have a swing?
is it not clear?
there was something wrong with him.
look, I get it.
Sergei was a little psycho.
and he was growing up fast.
and you didn't plan on actually killing him, which is what makes this more a crime of passion.
and you were concerned for your daughter's life.
I mean, isn't that why you put the dead bolt on her door?
Yes. Yes.
exactly, and last night after Taft
W went into the garage after we saw that poor dog lying in the yard.
and I grabbed Sergei, and I pulled him out from under the car.
and I demanded to know if he killed Ralphie.
and he just...
he just laughed.
so I grabbed the hammer, and... I hit him. I don't
I was so angry that I don't even think I knew what I was doing. It was -- I...
that's right, you were very mad the first time you hit him.
but then you hit him again.
there were two blows to the skull.
now, the first one wasn't hard enough, - but the second one was. - It wasn't hard at all -- not for me.
very hard for Sergei, yes, but not for me, no.
and then I -- I looked up at Susan. - Brian
now, wait a minute, ma'am. Are you involved in this crime?
did you participate with your husband? - She was screaming at me to stop, but it just didn't register somehow.
I think maybe I was so surprised after I hit him the first time, because it was
it was over before I made the decision, really.
and then I just -- I saw Sergei lying there, and I thought, "he's not mine. He's -- he's not part of me.
and then while Susan was yelling for me to stop,
I swung that hammer down as hard as I could.
then I wrapped him up in an old blanket, and I took him to where he liked to go the most, which is...a drain -- a sewage drain.
a fitting resting place, I thought.
and then I dumped the hammer and went home. And I thought, "wow, we have our family back, finally."
and you tell me, chief Johnson, what would you do if you were responsible for Sergei?
as it so happens, I am responsible for him.
and what I can do is put you under arrest for the murder of your son.
so, we couldn't have prevented Sergei's murder?
no, no, he was dead before we got the call.
so, here's the deal. From now on, we get a critical missing, for 72 hours we search around the clock with every available resource until we either find the child or the body.
no exceptions.
if that's a policy amendment, you won't get any argument from me.
okay.
Oh, and, uh...
if you would extend my personal apology to Fritz,
I'd appreciate it.
Absolutely.
well, tell the pope I accept his apology, because I'm gracious.
I hate it when they forget to put in that hot mustard.
why do I never ask for it?
because you're too gracious.
look what I have.
Oh, a brochure.
the Hollywood hills.
house is between my shoes and the tissue box, or your work and mine.
two bedrooms, office, pool, great views.
I take it, then, you're not interested in what school district we buy into?
I don't think we need to worry about schools, really.
I see.
so, unless you absolutely have your heart set on a bigger place...
well, I -- I go back and forth, but a bigger place that needs to be something we both want.
maybe in this case...
small is better.
good morning.
good morning.
what's that?
real-estate flyer
four bedrooms, ranch style, big backyard, a pool, a custom gourmet kitchen.
and it's within our price range? -Yeah.
Where's it located?
new copper plumbing, new electric, new roof.
where, though?
great school district, perfect for starting a family.
Fritzy, where is it?
Cal who?
your phone is the duplex, this tissue box, Parker Center, your shoes, the FBI on Wilshire, your underwear...
the valley.
and Calabasas is?
there.
that's not even Los Angeles.
it's L. A.County.
just see the place before you decide you hate it.
Brenda, Los Angeles is a big place.
are you saying you don't want me looking anywhere in the valley?
answer, answer, answer.
let it go to voice -- ...
mail.
deputy chief Johnson.
Yes, sergeant Gabriel.
when was that reported?
okay, where are you now?
I'll be there shortly.
critical missing
13-year-old boy missing 1 hour and 35 minutes.
you want to call the office and volunteer?
we could practice carpooling.
age 13.
according to his parents, they sent him to his room last night for arguing with his 16-year-old sister, Theresa, at approximately 8: 00 p. M.Yesterday evening.
this morning, 6: 00 a. M. Sergei's mother goes to wake him up, he's gone.
they look around for about 30 minutes, called 911.
do the Monroes have a home-security system, alarms, video cameras?
no, but apparently Sergei does have a cellphone.
we've been calling it, but it just keeps going straight to voice mail.
any sign of forced entry, busted windows, locks?
no, and we interviewed Mr. and Mrs. Monroe, and their daughter all individually, and they all say the same thing.
it was pretty much a normal evening.
chief, kid could be a runaway.
he's done this before.
his father said he only called 911 as a precaution anyway.
or because they're in denial.
all right, David.
Mrs. Monroe, mr. Monroe, I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson of the l. A.P. D. and this is agent Fritz howard from the FBI.
Oh, my god -- FBI?
Yeah, we help out with critical missings.
critical? What?
anytime a child 13 or under goes missing, we classify their return as our highest priority, which means we won't stop looking until we find your son.
but Sergei's just
I told your detectives, he's probably gonna show up at school any minute, or if he tries to come home, he's gonna see all of you here and think he's in even more trouble.
Sergei's run away twice before.
he's had a few problems adapting lately.
adapting to what?
america.
Where's he from?
russia.
we adopted him five years ago.
and you found him through?
an orphanage.
he had no family. There's no one.
there's no one in Russia that's gonna be looking for Sergei or trying to kidnap him.
this is -- my god...
so, the last time you saw Sergei was 8: 00 p. M. Last night after you sent him to his room for arguing with his sister. -Yes.
and what was the argument about?
just him using Theresa's things without permission.
I mean, this is nothing we haven't gone through before.
and where's your daughter now?
Theresa, we need to talk to you again.
Theresa, open the door, please.
so, the entire world stops to pay attention to Sergei. Is that it?
I see you like your privacy. -Uh-huh.
you see my hair?
it used to be a lot longer than this.
then one night Sergei thought it would be funny to cut it off while I was sleeping.
he does cute stuff like that
for example, torturing and killing my cat.
and no matter what dad tells you, that's why he put the lock on my door
because Sergei is a psycho.
you and Sergei had an argument last night.
what was that about?
he and his little pathetic friend Jason were
Jason -- who's Jason?
he'll do anything Sergei tells him.
it's pitiful.
and yesterday they both created yet another nightmare for our next-door neighbor, Mr. Taft.
what did they do to the neighbor
your brother and
Sergei's not my brother!
he's only here because my mom wanted to have a boy, and she couldn't have one herself.
okay, you listen to me, Theresa.
Sergei is missing.
this is very serious!
someone may have taken him or
taken him?
come with me.
you really think someone would want to abduct a kid who draws like this?
dad has to paint over the walls in here all the time.
chief, excuse me.
there's something you should see.
you're so worried about what someone might be doing to Sergei.
I think you should be more concerned about what Sergei is doing to someone else.
yo, move out a sec.
Thanks.
dried blood.
Yeah, I think so, too.
s. I.D. is analyzing the sample right now.
and the turn signal's cracked.
is that hair?
it is.
short, black, pulled from the root.
could be the boy's.
looks close.
whose car is this?
Theresa's.
okay, let's impound the vehicle, and Theresa also said something about Sergei and a next-door neighbor, a Mr. Taft.
let's see if we can talk to him.
chief, chief, this way.
according to a lady three houses down, a Mr. Taft -- divorced, lives alone
had an argument last night with Mr. Monroe.
they were standing right out here in the street, screaming and yelling at each other about Sergei.
now, she doesn't know why.
Sanchez is already over here at the Taft house, right here.
so, we're looking at a runaway here or not?
I'd rather have Sergei answer that question.
look here.
these look like fresh tire tracks, chief.
see if they match Theresa's car.
chief, no one's answering the door, but there's something in the backyard that we should look at.
okay.
is it locked?
Fritzy, do you mind?
want to lose the bag?
what is that?
a grave?
we got to get in there.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
detective, call judge Reisser.
get a search warrant for the house, the yard, and the cars.
okay, meanwhile, gentlemen, we have exigent circumstances, so let's start digging now.
you don't want to wait for a warrant?
no, no.
that grave is probable cause.
shovel, shovel, please!
get the warrant anyway.
I don't want a murderer to get away on a technicality.
okay.
thank you, thank you, detective.
hold it, hold it, hold it.
I got something. I got something.
okay.
easy, easy.
it's stiff, chief. It's stiff.
okay, okay.
Hey, hey!
Hey, what's going on here?!
what are you doing on my property?!
l. A.P. D.We've got a search warrant.
get him out of here.
what the hell is going on here?! -We have a warrant, sir.
you have no right to do this! No right!
what the hell are you doing on my property?! -Police business, sir.
you have no right to do this! No right!
instead of digging up Ralphie, why don't you arrest that little son of a bitch Sergei that killed my dog?
you saw Sergei Monroe do this to your dog?
trust me
the kid did it.
when was the last time you saw him?
yesterday morning.
what -- is Sergei missing?
did he run away...
again?
cause if he has, why don't you do everyone in the neighborhood a favor and stop looking for him?
sir, I find your attitude towards this boy worrisome.
how about this for an attitude?
I want that kid dead.
how about that?
you want some more suspects?
why don't you go up and down our street?
ask anyone, 'cause everyone hates Sergei
not just me.
and his parents are useless.
why didn't you report him to the police then?
I did!
but you people
you didn't do anything at all.
and what's the result?
yesterday I came home from work to find my dog dead on my front lawn.
Sergei and that creepy kid
they let him out of the backyard and they ran him down in cold blood.
now, when you say Sergei ran over Ralphie, you mean this 13-year-old kid was driving the vehicle?
Yeah, yeah, he's done it several times.
he takes his big sister's car out on the street for a race.
and that's against the law, isn't it?
What'd you do about that?
nothing.
so, after you found your dog, you went across the street and argued with Sergei's father.
I told Brian before that I would sue his ass, and I will.
what else did you tell him?
a neighbor heard you arguing.
did you threaten Sergei?
I don't remember what I said.
I'll tell you what I did.
I took my dog, who never hurt anyone, and I gave him a decent burial.
and then I got drunk.
and if that's a crime, then go ahead and arrest me.
excuse me one second.
Yeah, uh, listen...
let's you and I go take a walk, okay?
do me a favor. Put your hands in your pockets.
okay, do you want to arrest Mr. Taft for burying his dog in his backyard?
Ralphie is not our victim.
but he could be our motive.
or a good reason for Sergei to vamoose.
it explains why the Monroes weren't very specific about the argument they had with their son.
I sent a patrol car over to check Sergei's best friend, Jason.
nobody home, and he didn't go to school today, either.
but no one's reported him missing, and Jason and Sergei both have rap sheets.
I'm waiting to get them, but who knows?
maybe they took off somewhere together.
so, we need to have a discussion about circumstances.
what circumstances?
you want to call off the critical missing?
this kid, Sergei, has an extensive juvenile record and a history of running away.
it appears that his father punished him, not unjustly, and the boy ran off in the middle of the night.
if we investigated everything based on appearances, we'd have a whole lot less to do.
do I get a vote here?
I think it is too early to say what happened.
I'd like a vote, too, because, as of 3: 00 p. M.Today, I'm gonna have both presidential candidates in town, and I guess I'm gonna have to decide which one not to protect.
so, tell me, chief Johnson, is half my security force out there looking for a runaway?
you want me to decide right now if this is a critical missing?
I do.
would you be applying this kind of pressure if it was your kid we were looking for?
the city of Los Angeles does not want or expect me to run this department the way I do my family.
Sergei was two weeks shy of his 14th birthday.
if his parents called 911 15 days later, we would have sent one patrol car, two uniforms, and filed a report.
so, what are we doing here?
it doesn't feel like a critical missing.
it really doesn't. -Thank you.
priority homicide will continue the search for Sergei Monroe.
meanwhile, commander Taylor, break down the crisis center.
tell the press that, in line with the family's wishes, we're treating this situation as a runaway.
agent Howard, if you remain concerned, you're welcome to stay, of course.
chief, that guy's crying again.
I put him in the back of my car.
what do you want me to do with him?
uh, Lieutenant Flynn, you can let Mr. Taft go for now.
and if you would, please help me take ralphie back across the street.
thank you.
okay.
chief, the blood on the front of Theresa Monroe's car is, as suspected, Canine, and they've matched one of the hairs embedded in the front fender to poor Ralphie.
who was run over by Sergei, if we can believe Mr. Taft.
chief, I'm guessing that you can trust Mr. Taft on this.
I mean, apart from being a building contractor
and I've never had a good experience with a building contractor yet
Mr. Taft has no record.
well, our boy Sergei's got him beat big-time.
I've got his rap sheet here.
charges range from vandalism to marijuana possession.
underage driving without a license?
twice.
also, three times for truancy and disturbing the peace with guess who.
Hey, maybe these two boys are just hiding out together.
or they were abducted together.
Jason's 14 -- 6 months older than sergei.
his parents divorced last year, and he's been slipping out of school ever since, compiling his own history with the L. A.P. D.
tried contacting his mother on her cell, home, and office
no answer
Yeah, and there's still no answer at the door at the house, either.
okay, I want to check the dates on their arrest records, see how often they were picked up together and, um
and where.
uh, detective Sanchez.
as soon as either one of them makes a call, we can lock onto the cellphone tower they're using and find them.
why have you stopped looking for my son?
my whole division is applying every resource at its disposal to find your son.
so, Mr. Monroe, this morning, you were certain that Sergei had run away.
he's never been gone more than five hours before -- never.
and you said you wouldn't stop the search until you found him.
I haven't stopped.
but I have been seriously delayed because both you and your wife withheld information from me about the so-called family argument last night.
all right, look, Mr. Taft is already very upset.
I didn't want to drag him into this.
drag him into it?
sir, if Mr. Taft's story is true, he may well be the reason that Sergei is missing.
now, did Sergei run over his dog? -Yes.
with Theresa's car? -Yes.
Jason let the dog out.
Sergei ran him down.
we asked Theresa not to mention this to you.
because?
because we were afraid that if you thought Sergei was a problem child, instead of bringing him home, you might arrest him.
look, we're mortified about the entire situation.
we apologize.
and we're slow to understand how terrible it could be.
I mean, do you have anything at all?
the name Jason hetner keeps coming up, and we can't find him, either.
Jason's missing, too?
not technically.
but we can't find him, and we'd really like to.
well, Jason's a bad influence.
there's no question about it.
we tried to separate them.
but his mother won't call us back or meet with us, even though they've been arrested together.
uh, speaking of...
Yes, sergeant, what'd you find?
Jason and Sergei both have been reported for trespassing three times at a place known as the tunnels.
it's a neighborhood magnet for
we know what it's a magnet for, and I've absolutely forbidden Sergei to go there again.
I mean, it's dangerous.
why
Oh, Susan, we should go there and see if he's there or if Jason's there.
uh, no, no, no, no, no.
we're going.
I would like to come with you.
look, ma'am, I understand why you would like to come, but it is more important that you and your husband go home and wait for Sergei to call.
no, no, our daughter's there with the people you have covering the phones, and Theresa will call us the second that Sergei comes back.
if he sees me, if he hears me call his name, he'd be more likely to answer.
please, I do better with him than anyone else.
Sergei, it's mom!
Mrs. Monroe, I have to ask you not to call out, please.
we don't know who all's in here.
thank you.
nice hideout.
all right, lieutenant Provenza, please wait here with the parents.
lieutenant Tao, I'd like to get a patrol car or two, if we can get them.
all right, then, let's see what all's down here.
l. A.P. D.
anyone in here?
just a rat. Just a rat.
relax.
chief? Chief!
Oh, god.
okay, okay, okay.
okay, detective Sanchez, lieutenant Flynn, let's find out if Sergei's by himself in here.
detective Daniels, please step outside and call the morgue and S.I.D.
I need this place checked for a weapon and blood.
and I want the search revved up for Jason Hetner, please.
you got it.
Hey, where are you going?!
I'm getting some air.
besides, this isn't a critical missing anymore, is it?
what did you find?!
Hello?!
is he in there?! Did you find him?!
Hello?!
suffered two blowsto the head from an almost-blunt instrument
a bad hit here at the left temple, then a very bad hit here at the left central parietal bone
death almost instantaneous.
there wasn't a lot of blood where we found him.
then he died elsewhere.
hmm, that also explains why we found no weapon.
well, look for something that leaves a waffle pattern.
see this cross-hatching with dimples?
probably some sort of tool, I'm guessing.
like for construction?
maybe something a building contractor might have.
sounds right.
were there any signs of molestation?
no, thank god.
the poor kid was murdered, but it stopped there.
would you preserve the wounds for me, doctor?
with a casting or the epidermis itself?
uh, cut out the actual wound, please.
thank you.
would you like that for here or to go?
doctor.
chief Pope.
uh, time of death?
the boy was found in a dark, moist place, which could have sped up the decomp.
so, I'd have to say, broadly, between 6 and 24 hours.
thank you.
as soon as you can, please, doctor.
excuse me.
I-I made a horrible mistake.
will, we have two things to rely on
instinct and training.
we went with our gut feelings, and
because of that, this boy is dead.
we don't know our culpability yet.
Sergei could have left the house in the middle of the night.
he could have been dead before we got the call.
and on his body, we found a cellphone and some pot, so -- so, it wasn't a robbery.
what are you suggesting then?
this was, what?
a fight between friends or that Sergei was a little drug dealer?
cause that's a big "so what?
he's still a 13-year-old kid.
what about this friend
is he a suspect or another possible victim?
uh, I can't say.
we are having trouble locating him, but I have the rest of my detectives and six patrol cars out looking for him.
all right, as of now, Jason Hetner is missing.
use any resources you have to find him.
I don't care what it costs.
excuse me, chiefs, detective Sanchez just found Jason.
he's on his way down to parker center with him right now.
is the boy all right?
he's okay enough to run.
the little bastard's fast, too.
Yeah, so, his mother finally comes home, and we ask her, you know, "can we look in your garage?
can we look in your son's room?
and she says, "Is this all because he skipped school again?
like it was nothing at all.
is she here now?
Jason's mother?
too tired.
great mom, huh?
didn't see her son this morning.
hadn't seen him since last night.
she finally lets us into Jason's room.
and as I'm looking in the kid's closet, guess who crawls out from under the bed.
and he jumps out the window, and I have to chase him for five blocks.
so, any chance this boy is our murderer?
he ran.
okay, let's go, sergeant.
good work, good work.
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
I just have a few questions about the last 24 hours.
questions I don't have to answer, right?
that's true.
instead of you and I having a little conversation, I could arrest you and send you to Juvie.
and since you've demonstrated that you're a flight risk, I will personally speak at your petition to detain.
you'll be in custody for the entire six months leading up to your trial.
is that really how you want to spend your summer and fall?
no.
let's try the questions, then, shall we?
you are friends with Sergei Monroe, are you not?
ask Sergei who his friends are.
all right, never mind.
book this little smart aleck.
no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait a minute!
how much trouble am I in?
well, I can guarantee you it's gonna get worse if you don't cooperate.
fine, fine.
I'll tell you what happened yesterday.
I just want some protection.
protection from who?
and why do you need protection from him?
he makes me do things.
makes you?
how does he make you?
he just does.
well, what does he use? A knife, a gun?
I mean, come on, you're bigger than Sergei.
he knows.
he knows certain things about me.
what things?
that's not part of the story, okay?
God, all right?
he just makes me do things!
I need to know what that means or I am leaving.
I'm leaving.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
wait a minute!
okay.
if you want to know, okay.
Sergei pulled me into an alley once, and...
he grabbed my hand...
pulled me towards him...
asked me if I...
he asked me...
are you saying Sergei made sexual advances on you?
Yes.
what did he do?
he...
asked me if I wanted to kiss him.
and I did.
but Sergei didn't.
it was a trap.
then every day after that, he threatened to tell people all about me.
so, he's been blackmailing you?
Yeah.
ain't love grand?
geez, Louise.
this Sergei kid.
he can't know that I'm telling you this.
that's a promise I can keep, provided that you tell me exactly what happened yesterday.
okay.
so, Sergei wanted me to let Ralphie out in Mr. Taft's yard.
he was gonna drive Theresa's car up the street, and the dog would chase it.
I opened the gate, and Ralphie ran out in the front yard.
but Sergei didn't drive off.
he...
he gunned the car over the curb, and he hit the dog.
I jumped off the fence.
I ran, and I tried to help ralphie, but he was making these
these gurgling sounds.
okay?
I'm sorry.
okay, okay.
what happened then?
well, then, I made Sergei take the car back into the garage.
and look, really, if I had known that he
that he was gonna kill Ralphie, I would have never helped him
never.
so, did you fight with him after that?
did you punish him for what he did to Ralphie?
punish him?
you're kidding, right?
Jason, Sergei Monroe was found dead this afternoon in a place you two were known to hang out
the tunnels.
what?
he -- how did...
wait, oh, my -- you think that
you think that I killed him?!
it w-wasn't me!
it was Mr. Taft! It was Mr. Taft!
I'm telling you, it was Mr. Taft, okay?!
how do you know it was Mr. Taft?
because I-I heard him.
he was screaming at Mr. Monroe in the street, okay?
and -- and he was saying to him how he was gonna
how he's gonna kill Sergei.
right back where we started.
but I didn't hear anything after that, damn it.
because that's when Sergei's sister came in the garage when we were hammering out the dents.
and she was freaking out, and I ran.
I just ran.
did you say hammering out the dents?
voice-mail recordings from Sergei Monroe's cellphone minus the messages from L. A.P. D.
okay, thank you.
uh, do you have a flashlight, lieutenant, and a cellphone, please?
thank you.
Thanks.
are you looking for something, chief?
a circular waffle pattern...
that matches...
this.
what do you think, lieutenant?
I think you got a match.
you want me to take off the fender?
Yes, please, and could you bring it to the murder room?
thank you.
Luis, pull that fender.
what makes a child go bad
nature or nurture?
unfortunately, chief, by the time we get involved, it really doesn't matter.
Sergei, this is Theresa, and I hate your stupid guts.
I hate you!
you've ruined my car, and when you get home, I'm going to kill you!
message received yesterday at 7: 18 a. M.
damn it, Sergei, the police are outside your house!
man, leave me out of this.
message received yesterday at 7: 43 a. M.
Sergei, you're destroying this family.
mom can't stop crying.
dad's going out of his mind, all because of you.
I hope you're dead.
I hope you've been run over the same way you ran over Ralphie.
Hey.
sounds like there's more than one problem child out there.
there are no more messages in your mailbo
you were right.
I should have kept the critical-missing designation.
Yeah.
well...
the odds were stacked against you from the start.
Hey, I was looking at that.
it sold already.
you were right.
it was too far away.
the only reason to move out there is the schools.
otherwise, maybe more house than we need.
maybe more trouble than we want to go through.
what do you think?
let's talk about it tonight.
is that okay?
okay.
Hey, have a good day at work. -You too.
lieutenant Provenza, good morning.
I'm on my way to the morgue, and I need you to do a few things for me first.
you had lieutenant Provenza arrest Theresa Monroe for murdering her brother?
Yes.
time of death?
I won't know exactly until I get the confession.
all right, well, uh, I'll watch then.
excuse me.
Theresa's parents haven't asked for a lawyer, but they do want to be in the room while you talk to her.
buzz has already set up some extra cameras.
I'll take care of it.
uh, lieutenant, I need a waiver form, please.
Yes, ma'am.
our daughter would never murder her own brother ever.
well, Theresa told me that she didn't think of Sergei as her actual brother.
and you know what?
I believe her.
how can you do this to us after all we've been through?
look, if you want to stay here while I interview your daughter, I need you and your wife to initial the marked areas and sign on the bottom or leave.
this explains your rights.
Theresa, you recognize this fender?
I didn't do anything to Sergei.
are you suggesting that Theresa ran over our son?
sir, sign the forms or leave!
there's no in between!
let's look underneath the fender, please.
on the underside
see this waffle pattern?
someone was trying to pound the fender back into shape.
this is from Sergei's scalp
the skin from one of the bludgeoning wounds that killed him!
get it away from me!
get it away from me, mom!
mom!
you will notice that the waffle pattern on the epidermis of the wound matches exactly the one on the car.
I will not let you continue t-t-to treat us like
this is disgusting and unfair to my daughter. -How can you show this to us?!
to prove the same tool that was used on your daughter's car was also used to kill your son.
that is the mark that this hammer makes.
Sergei was using one just like it to hammer out the dents in Theresa's car.
she came out to the garage while he was using it, grabbed it from his hand, and killed him.
What?! -Brian, stop this.
Sergei cut your hair.
he killed your cat.
he stole your car and wrecked it.
and in a fit of anger, you jerked this from his hand and smashed his head in!
I have a witness!
I never wanted Sergei to...
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
you have a witness?
you have a witness who saw Theresa kill my son?
he puts her in the garage while the hammer was being used.
and Theresa left two threatening messages on Sergei's cellphone yesterday at 7: 00 in the morning, saying she intended to kill him.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Theresa made those calls after Sergei was already dead.
how do you know when he died?
we were never able to establish a time of death.
but you bring up an excellent point.
only people who thought Sergei was still alive would bother calling him on his cell.
there were two messages from Theresa and one from Jason Hetner, but not one from you or your wife.
and why?
because you knew he wouldn't answer!
dad?
dad, what is she talking about?
it's okay.
lieutenant Tao, would you please escort Theresa out of the room?
come with me, dear.
go ahead, honey.
we'll be out in a minute.
go ahead.
it's okay. -This way.
so, sit down.
let's talk.
you called 911.
you thought that someone would just pop over and take a quick report.
you were stunned at our reaction.
you came down here to find out how close we were to actually finding something.
you did everything you could to point us in the direction of Jason.
well, those games are over now.
which one of you is the monster that killed your own son?
Sergei was the monster.
killing that dog was only the last in a long list of horrible, horrible things
a list that starts with stuffing his pet hamsters in the garbage disposal, cutting up squirrels, killing cats, stepping on baby birds.
and I...
I thought we could work with him, and I tried.
we took him to anger camps, to psychiatrists.
we sent him to boarding school, to -- to a military academy.
we even tried to return him to Russia, and they wouldn't take him back.
Susan, we can't hide what happened.
no, no, she does not understand!
Sergei's aggression was created by his biological mother, who abandoned him, or it was genetics or...
I mean, where else does that sort of violence come from?
maybe from parents who smashed him in the head with a hammer.
which one of you did that, or did you both have a swing?
is it not clear?
there was something wrong with him.
look, I get it.
Sergei was a little psycho.
and he was growing up fast.
and you didn't plan on actually killing him, which is what makes this more a crime of passion.
and you were concerned for your daughter's life.
I mean, isn't that why you put the dead bolt on her door?
Yes. Yes.
exactly, and last night after Taft
we went into the garage after we saw that poor dog lying in the yard.
and I grabbed Sergei, and I pulled him out from under the car.
and I demanded to know if he killed Ralphie.
and he just...
he just laughed.
so I grabbed the hammer, and...
I hit him.
I don't -- I was so angry that I don't even think I knew what I was doing.
it was -- I...
that's right, you were very mad the first time you hit him.
but then you hit him again.
there were two blows to the skull.
now, the first one wasn't hard enough, but the second one was.
it wasn't hard at all -- not for me.
very hard for Sergei, yes, but not for me, no.
and then I -- I looked up at Susan.
now, wait a minute, ma'am.
are you involved in this crime?
did you participate with your husband?
she was screaming at me to stop, but it just didn't register somehow.
I think maybe I was so surprised after I hit him the first time, because it was -- it was over before I made the decision, really.
and then I just -- I saw sergei lying there, and I thought, "he's not mine.
he's -- he's not part of me.
and then while Susan was yelling for me to stop, I swung that hammer down as hard as I could.
then I wrapped him up in an old blanket, and I took him to where he liked to go the most, which is...A drain
a sewage drain.
a fitting resting place, I thought.
and then I dumped the hammer and went home.
and I thought, "wow, we have our family back, finally.
and you tell me, chief Johnson, what would you do if you were responsible for Sergei?
as it so happens, I am responsible for him.
and what I can do is put you under arrest for the murder of your son.
so, we couldn't have prevented Sergei's murder?
no, no, he was dead before we got the call.
so, here's the deal.
from now on, we get a critical missing, for 72 hours we search around the clock with every available resource until we either find the child or the body.
no exceptions.
if that's a policy amendment, you won't get any argument from me.
okay.
Oh, and, uh...
if you would extend my personal apology to Fritz, I'd appreciate it.
Absolutely.
well, tell the Pope I accept his apology, because I'm gracious.
I hate it when they forget to put in that hot mustard.
why do I never ask for it?
because you're too gracious.
look what I have.
Oh, a brochure.
the hollywood hills.
house is between my shoes and the tissue box, or your work and mine.
two bedrooms, office, pool, great views.
I take it, then, you're not interested in what school district we buy into?
I don't think we need to worry about schools, really.
I see.
so, unless you absolutely have your heart set on a bigger place...
well, I -- I go back and forth, but a bigger place
that needs to be something we both want.
maybe in this case...
small is better.
clay, why are you using that thing to cut a coffee cake? Here.
y'all come and get it while it's still hot!
who else is coming for breakfast?
Switzerland?
don't be silly.
shopped in palm springs yesterday.
made breakfast in L. A.this morning.
I just love that RV.
we're gonna go from here up to Alaska and then come back through the Yukon territory.
we'll be done by Thanksgiving.
Oh, unless we need to come back sooner, you know?
I hear Canada's pretty in the fall.
clay, we talked about this.
it doesn't matter when they get married as long as they're happy.
anybody want some more biscuits and gravy?
you know what makes me happy?
weddings.
I just love weddings.
don't you like weddings, son?
the phone.
Hello?
Oh, yes, sergeant. Morning.
okay. Where?
Y- yes. Uh, okay, fine. I- I'll be right there.
I'm so sorry to cut this short, but there's been a murder at a movie studio.
and -- and this was such a great breakfast, too. I...
honey...
I thought we had an agreement that you would never leave me alone with your parents again.
Oh, I had no choice, Fritzi.
and I didn't even know they were coming until they showed up last night.
I got it.
I -- special agent Fritz Howard, FBI. Oh, you're kidding.
Oh, that's -- that's -- no, horrible. Oh, that is bad. Horrible.
no, no, no. I'll be there as soon as possible. Okay.
there's a bomb threat at the airport.
well, this has got to be the most dangerous city on the planet earth.
no, I-I'm on my way.
but we can't leave mama and daddy here by themselves. - Honey
Brenda Leigh, don't worry about us. We'll be fine. Won't we, dear?
Yeah, and there's no reason why they can't come along with one of us.
what would you guys rather do?
you can come with me now, spend a few hours in a makeshift tent watching an extremely slow-moving robot,
or you can head off to a hollywood movie studio. Either way.
Oh, goodness.
is this where they do "dancing with the stars"?
I'd like to welcome you to vintage studios.
I'll be your tour guide.
my name is Mike. - Bye. Bye, y'all.
I'm gonna take your picture. - Have fun.
how nice.
our, uh, victim's name is Rachel Hughes.
she's a 33-year-old white female.
she works as a, uh, hair stylist on "trauma unit.
it's a television show.
films here on the lot.
we've already started criminal-background checks on all the cast and crew members.
where was the body found?
she was stuffed in a jockey box.
that's what they call the, uh, storage lockers underneath the truck.
this morning, an electrician went into this particular jockey box,
looking for some extra cable.
found her inside.
okay.
defensive wounds on her knuckles.
scrape marks on her elbows and ankles.
there's scuff marks on the sides of her shoes and heels.
so she was dragged.
Yeah, there's a trail of blood that leads from the hair-and-makeup trailer to this one here.
Oh, these marks here.
did the coroner's investigator say what caused them?
no.
and no one heard screaming?
according to studio security, no one heard a thing.
Oh, uh, Rachel Stayed late after filming stopped yesterday -- not a lot of people around.
and we know this how?
well, Rachel Shared a trailer with a makeup artist -- Kim Reynolds.
and Kim left last night around 8: 00 p. m.
she said that Rachel was waiting for someone.
any idea who?
makeup girl -- uh, woman -- said that Rachel was hanging out waiting for one of her private clients.
no name, huh?
well, according to this makeup girl -- Uh, woman
Rachel was the kind of person who kept her schedule on her cellphone,
which she left at home yesterday.
now, Rachel's keys are missing, but her car is still here.
did Rachel have a boyfriend or a husband?
anyone come looking for her?
Yeah, detective Daniels is checking on that now.
all right. Thank you.
well, whoever attacked Rachel -- they slammed her head up against the mirror.
and she didn't get a chance to clean up after her private client.
and it looks like all this hair is from the same head.
Yeah, and we have an idea whose head it might be.
Rachel Hughes was married.
but six months ago, she filed for divorce and had a restraing order issued against her husband, Ryan.
security logs. This is everybody who entered the lot in the last 24 hours.
now, guess who dropped by for a visit.
last night -- 8: 24 p. m.
looks like Rachel's husband wasn't taking his restraing order very seriously.
where does he live?
no new address for him anywhere.
all right. Sergeant Gabriel, Lieutenant Flynn, let's head over to the victim's house and find that cellphone.
is that a current address?
uh, the address on the restraining order matches the one on her driver's license.
okay. Lieutenant Provenza, would you please organize some interviews with all the people - Who were at the studio last night? - Okay.
and, detective Daniels, would you and detective Sanchez please find Ryan Hughes for me?
I'd rather like to talk to him.
Oh, that blood looks so real.
clay, smile.
thank you.
lieutenant Provenza, you remember my parents.
well, of course.
Hello, there, Willie Ray. Clay.
to what do we owe this pleasure?
I think somebody got murdered.
y'all are finished with the tour? Already?
Oh, it was just like a dream.
of a big trailer lot.
well, uh, I need to run an errand,
but Lieutenant Provenza will organize a ride for y'all back to the office.
Oh, I'll do better than that, chief.
how would the two of you like to watch some filming?
Oh, my goodness, my goodness. Really?
come on, Willie Ray.
let me show you where the magic happens.
lieutenant, I'll bet you say that to all the girls.
I bet he does say that to all the girls.
I know his type.
how long you gonna be?
I just need to hop by the victim's house.
you'll hardly know I'm gone.
God, you scared the crap out of me.
so sorry. Excuse me.
Hi, I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson from the L. A.P. D. And you are?
it's so nice to meet you, sir.
we thought, uh -- we were looking for your wife.
Rachel doesn't live here anymore.
and I was on my way to the gym, so...
well, maybe you could help us then.
can we come in, ask you a few questions?
do you have a warrant? - No.
out here's good.
what do you want to know?
when was the last time you saw your wife?
uh, I don't remember, exactly.
do you know how to get in touch with her?
she works on a television show -- "trauma unit.
she's not there today.
okay, then. Try her cellphone.
no answer. Where is she staying, sir?
look, my wife and I are separated.
she won't even give me her new address.
is that because of the restraing order issued against you?
nice haircut, champ.
Rachel's work, I take it.
from last night, right? Isn't that why your name's on the security list?
I knew it! - Take it easy.
she told me I could be there, okay?
well, she didn't like the way the visit ended.
Ryan Hughes, you're under arrest for the violation of your restraing order.
hands behind your back, please.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you by the state.
t have anyone from the L. A.P. D.at this airport bombing, not a single officer.
uh, we're not at L. A.X. We're in Ontario.
ontario.
Hey, look, we're trying to keep this low-profile.
so try not mentioning it to everyone you know, okay?
detective Sanchez is still completely out of it because of the death of his brother.
and what am I supposed to do with my parents?
I've got a suspect in the interview room who probably beat his wife to death last night.
probably?
well, when can you come home?
honey, I-I can't leave the mobile command unit until we know there's no bomb out here.
besides, Willie Ray and Clay are old enough to stay in our apartment for a few hours by themselves.
we have cable.
Oh, no. I don't want them at the apartment by themselves.
they'll -- they'll do things.
I'll take care of your parents, chief.
no. I can't impose on you again. We're working.
I'm losing another 15 sick days next month.
look, you've arrested the husband. This case is effectively over.
all right, fine.
Fritzi... - Yeah.
lieutenant provenza has volunteered to take care of my poor parents, so thanks so much for your help.
lieutenant, are you sure about this?
Oh, chief. Now, the suspect will be in tears in 20 minutes.
hold his hand, write him up, the end.
honey, I think your mother and I ought to go on and get out of your way.
you're not in the way, daddy. Don't be silly.
but if y'all have had enough here,
lieutenant Provenza has kindly offered to drive you back to the apartment.
Oh, no, no, no, no. We don't, uh, want to be in the way. We'll just take a cab.
Oh, I wouldn't hear of it.
chief, you do what you need to do, and I'll entertain your parents.
we don't need entertaining.
I'm entertaining enough on my own.
clay, what's wrong with you?
lieutenant Provenza, we'll drive by the grocery store, and I'll pick up some things for dinner.
Oh, Willie Ray, that sounds wonderful to me.
well, if you're too busy, I guess I'll just have to get to know your friends.
please tell me we found where Rachel Hughes was living.
no one at the studio can tell us, and her paychecks go directly to a p. o.box.
and she never updated her next-of-kin information.
so the guy that we're supposed to notify is her husband.
okay, so, let's use her social security number and see if we can find someone in her family.
maybe she told her parents where she lived, though I don't recommend it.
lieutenant Tao, what about her phone records?
I'm waiting for Rachel's carrier to send me the dump off her cell.
Yeah, what about the husband?
Oh, this is a great guy.
a year ago, he broke Rachel's wrist.
six months ago, he gave her a concussion.
and a day later, she checked out of the E. R.
and then took the restraing order out on her husband and filed for divorce.
and left her own house?
though she's still paying the mortgage.
why on earth would she do that?
I'm guessing, but Ryan hasn't made any money lately.
this year, he guest-starred in one sitcom and one drama
not even enough to make his health insurance.
so he's an actor.
Yes, and a bartender -- two shifts a week.
Rachel was the one with the steady paycheck.
maybe she left Ryan the house because he couldn't afford to go anywhere else.
so what? He was beating her. Why did she move? And where did she move to?
excuse me, but chief Pope and commander Taylor are here.
uh, thank you, Buzz. I'll be right there.
sergeant Gabriel, would you meet me in the interview room, please?
and will somebody find me Rachel's address? Thank you.
what can I do for you, gentlemen?
uh, you, uh, like the husband for this, right?
maybe.
though I need to figure out how he had a major knock-down,
drag-out with his wife and kept his skin smoother than mine.
he's smarter than your average abuser.
wouldn't let us into his house without a search warrant.
and if he really doesn't know that his wife is dead,
well, the times, and specifically our old friend Ricardo Ramos,
seems to have developed the opinion that we only deploy priority homicide
when the victims are rich, white, and/or related to police officers.
and our ace reporter called me this morning,
asking if we had added show-business murders to the list.
this guy's an actor, right?
Yes, but not a famous one.
he could be tomorrow.
am in trouble for something? - No, no, no.
no, no, no. You're doing an incredible job. That's not the issue.
the issue for Ramos is, uh, who gets priority treatment from the police and who doesn't. That's all.
for example, we have several investigators who deal exclusively with domestic-abuse issues,
and I didn't deploy one of them to the studio. I sent you.
well, we didn't know this was a domestic-abuse case until after we identified the victim.
that's a good point, sir.
but how do we avoid the impression
that we made this murder a priority because of the hollywood connection?
but that is why it's a priority, isn't it?
Yeah, that and the reporters flying in helicopters over the studio, sir.
Yeah, but we don't want to say any of that.
tell Ramos that we're hoping that Rachel's murder was an isolated incident
and not someone breaking into studio lots and killing people.
that might stop Ramos.
stop him from what?
nothing. Never mind.
you know, uh, tired of being pushed around by the times.
just, uh, get on with what you need to get done here.
okay.
thank you.
you know this is one big setup, right?
how's that, sir?
well, why else would Rachel tell me to stop by for a haircut and then report me to the police?
she wants to use this to screw me in the divorce...
Oh, I doubt that. - And ruin my career.
you know, I'm unfamiliar with your business, sir.
do two extremely small jobs a year make a career?
I'll leave my curiosity about the part-time actor's life aside.
let's talk about last night.
what's to talk about?
I got a part on a big feature film.
she told me to come -- she volunteered to cut my hair.
and while you were there, did you guys -- did you have an argument?
did she take a little too much off the top?
no. We didn't have an argument.
you know, it's hard to believe that he didn't work more, because you are just so convincing.
look, I just got a part on a big studio film, so
wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's -- let's start again.
let's start again, and this time,
I want you to remember that those hair-and-makeup trailers have very thin walls
and people hear things all the time.
did you argue with your wife, sir?
we had a small disagreement.
what about? - Look...
I have done everything that Rachel has asked me to do.
I even apologized for every single argument that we ever had
and I took those anger-management classes Donna recommended.
who's Donna?
her friend, Donna.
I never met her.
I don't even know her last name,
but it still doesn't stop donna from convincing my wife that I'm an asshole, which I'm not.
I mean, I'm passionate, okay? I'm sensitive.
that's what all good actors are supposed to be.
but I love my wife, which is why I have stayed away from her, just like she asked.
but you didn't stay away from her, sir.
you saw her last -- - because she told me I could!
if I were you, sir, I'd put my ass back in that chair.
well, I think it's safe to say that you are a freshman in anger management.
so, I'm supposed to believe that after you give your wife a concussion And broke her wrist, she called you up and said,"hey, come on over for a haircut"?
a haircut you felt the need to lie about?
here we go.
I didn't want to get in any trouble, okay?
is that how you usually avoid trouble? You just lie to the police?
look, I made a mistake, okay?
a mistake?
like violating your restraining order or lying to me about last night?
I did not violate the spirit of the order.
tell me, how many mistakes did it take before your wife ended up like this?
Oh, my...
is she dead?
not just dead -- murdered...
savagely beaten.
and to me, it looks like someone was very angry.
I - I want a lawyer.
fine.
sergeant, will you please see that Mr. Hughes here gets his phone call?
chief Johnson was wrong about one thing.
what?
this guy's a much better actor than we thought.
so nice of you to drive Clay and Willie Ray around to all these different wedding facilities, Lieutenant.
Oh, I enjoyed it.
it reminded me of when I was young and stupid.
Brenda, where's your appetite?
well, darling, she's still thinking about the murder.
I am... A little.
the victim surprises me.
on the one hand, she stood up for herself and got legal action.
and on the other, she handed over her house to a bully.
I guess I just don't understand that kind of relationship.
I'll tell you one thing.
if your mother raised her hand against me, I'd be out the door.
well, you and Willie Ray have a great marriage, Clay,
which just goes to prove that the institution doesn't have to be a complete horror show.
actually, my third wife and I had one fantastic weekend.
of course, that was before the wedding, but still.
now, my fourth marriage -- oh, lord.
honey, don't listen to him.
here, uh, this will take your mind off work.
look at that beautiful little chapel there.
now, if you're determined not to get
excuse me. I'm -- I'm sorry. I'll be right back.
clay, I told you about this.
this what?
it's a chapel.
you can use a chapel for any number of things.
for example, if they don't get married pretty soon, y'all can congregate there for my funeral.
all right, that's enough.
Fritz, brenda looked upset.
did she? I'll see.
happily ever after resort and casino.
talk about bad odds.
if I hear one more mention of weddings or chapels, I swear I'm going to kill someone.
he's just excited. That's all.
you don't understand my daddy.
when he wants something, he will not stop until he gets it. Trust me on this.
so, it runs in the family then.
here's what I don't get.
you are so tough at work, and here, you come home.
you're sitting at your own dining-room table.
your father pushes you around a little bit.
and instead of saying, "don't do that to me," you come hide in the kitchen.
wait a minute.
that's why we can't find her address. - What?
she learned to hide.
she said, "well, what are those names?
and he said,"well, those are Provenza's ex-wives.
lieutenant Flynn...
I'm so sorry to bother you this late.
you know that emergency room where Rachel Hughes went for her concussion?
I want you to check for domestic-violence shelters in the area.
see if there's one that the hospital recomme
I'm particularly interested in any with a Donna working on-site.
okay, thank you.
this is what Rachel looked like the first night she arrived.
Ryan did that to her for buying a brass lamp when he was hoping for new headshots.
well, as hard as it is to believe, she looks even worse now.
I could tell he wasn't gonna change.
you met him?
somehow he found out that she'd come here.
and one night, he stopped me in the parking lot and waved like we'd met.
well, he seemed -- you know, he's very charming.
and he was in my face before I realized that he was threatening me.
thank god we have a guard posted nearby.
wait, wait. You said he threatened you? He threatened you how?
I had insisted that Rachel get her own place and not give the address to anyone.
she followed my advice, which made Ryan furious.
that's why she had a p. o.box - Right.
that's one of the first things they learn, the women who come here -- to defend their privacy.
and Rachel participated in our volunteer programs.
we always need volunteers.
we've got more women than we can ever accommodate.
well, I know you don't usually give out this kind of information,
but Rachel doesn't need you to keep her address a secret anymore,
and we could really use it.
actually, she gave me a spare key to her apartment.
I'll take you there myself.
so, if Ryan didn't break the door down, how did he get in?
Rachel's keys were missing from the crime scene.
so he just unlocked the door and walked in.
but if Rachel was keeping her new address a secret, how did he know to come here?
did Rachel have something Ryan wanted?
not that I know of. - Chief...
blood on the base.
how did we end up at another crime scene?
maybe Ryan beat up rachel here and drove her back to the studio and then beat her again.
with an interruption for a haircut?
okay, maybe after the haircut, he follows her home, kills her here.
and drove her back to the studio past security?
dragging Rachel's body from the makeup trailer to the jockey box?
okay, Daniels, why don't you just figure it out?
so, he kills Rachel, maybe to get the keys.
but how did he know what door they'd open?
look at this. Flynn, here, here. Read this with me here.
uh, you do the highlighted parts. I'll do the doctor.
what? I'm gonna do the broad's role? - Yeah.
he's dying, ma'am. We've done all we can.
you've got to do something, doc. Please, anything. Be my hero.
be my hero.
gentlemen, the cellphone. Please.
okay, I'll check the bedroom, chief.
strands of blond hair.
blond hair?
Rachel wasn't a blonde.
maybe the blood isn't hers, either.
did, uh -- did Rachel have a roommate?
Oh, my god.
what is it?
Rachel called me last week and asked if we had room available for someone she'd just met.
we didn't.
but you said Rachel volunteers sometimes.
she may have taken someone in.
thank you.
Oh, for heaven sakes. This one isn't like mine.
chief, I got it. - Oh, thank you.
I need Rachel's schedule for the night before last. Please.
Ryan -- haircut, 8:00.
so, maybe he wasn't lying.
so, Ryan Hughes kills his wife, somehow finds this address, and then comes here.
fights with someone else, doesn't get a scratch on him either time?
but who does he fight with?
I think we need to start looking for another victim.
Oh, yeah.
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, and this is sergeant Gabriel.
Yeah. I, uh, saw you yesterday, but I had already spoken to that cute detective Sanchez.
I was hoping that you could tell me if Rachel Hughes had a roommate.
Oh, um, I wouldn't know really.
uh, she and I weren't that close.
did you guys not get along or something?
no. I mean, her whole relationship with Ryan just drove me crazy.
and, honestly, it was all she talked about. I -- I don't know.
maybe I should have paid more attention.
did Rachel tell you that she had moved?
Yeah, yeah.
did she tell you where she moved?
no, no, no. That was like some kind of, like,"rule" or something.
like, nobody could know where she lived.
you know what, though?
um, you guys should really talk to Lindsay.
she knew Rachel way better than me.
is this Lindsay?
Yeah. She's our new hair stylist.
well, thank you. Thank you so much. - Sure.
you were very helpful. - Oh, I try.
you know, actually, if you, um...
if you think of anything else, you give me a call.
Oh, okay, I will.
all right, thanks. - Okay.
pardon me. Lindsay?
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
I understand that you were friends with Rachel Hughes.
Oh, uh, yeah.
I subbed for Rachel when she was in the hospital.
did you spend a lot of time with Rachel lately?
not really. Her hours were so extreme.
funny, I...
I so wanted to be the head of the hair department somewhere.
wish it wasn't here.
Lindsay, do you always display your cosmetology license?
we're required to post it where we work. State law.
thank you.
you were right, chief.
Rachel's cosmetology license has her new address on it.
and the card stock it was printed on matches the same bit we found on her mirror at the crime scene.
Yeah, she had that license out for the whole world to see.
Yeah, but Lindsay told us she taped up the bottom half of it in order to hide her address.
and someone ripped it down.
okay, so, we've got two crime scenes, two victims,
and a suspect who fought both without one defensive wound.
well, maybe 'cause he was wearing these.
sap gloves.
we had them on the streets back in the '80s.
they'll leave the same square marks we found on Rachel's face.
I knew those welts looked familiar.
embedded steel. Protects your fists.
Yeah, well, that explains pretty boy's silk knuckles.
all right, Lieutenant Flynn, let's see if we can track down the companies that make these gloves.
maybe we'll get lucky, and one of them will have an order for a Ryan Hughes.
you got it, chief. - Thank you.
what the hell is he reading?
a movie script. His attorney brought it in for him.
he's supposed to start rehearsals for it tomorrow.
chief Johnson, I have something unusual to suggest to you.
um, given that the suspect has lawyered up and the circumstantial evidence against him is so strong,
I think that we should arrest Mr. Hughes for murder right now and hand him over to the D. A.
without a confession? Why?
because of what Ramos might write in the times? - No, no, no.
from the outside, this crime looks all kind of show biz-y.
but the second -- the second we make an arrest,
the murder becomes a domestic dispute between a hair stylist and a wanna be actor, and...
that's not news in Los Angeles.
let me give you the whole picture here.
ricardo Ramos is writing a two-part article, as we speak, on priority homicide.
now, I have done everything I can to kill this article on the basis that it's one-sided, unfair, and bad for the city.
anyway, I failed.
the article will come.
it will be terrible.
let me talk to Ramos.
I don't think that would be - - no. Absolutely not.
then explain to him that there is another crime scene associated with this so-called hollywood victim
and that if I give up today due to unwarranted media pressure,
then I'll be short a dead body when we go to trial.
or tell him that
for heaven's sakes.
you know, I can't let Ramos dictate how I do my job.
she just doesn't get it, does she?
she doesn't want to get it.
hello.
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
Dan Frye. I represent Nr. Hughes. And I've talked to my client, and I'd like you to explain why he's still being held without any charges being filed.
well, maybe there won't be any, if I can get a few things explained.
like what?
well, your client claimed that he didn't know Donna Taft,
from the support center for domestic violence, when, in fact,
he threatened Donna when she would not tell him where his wife
unrelated, no evidentiary value. Next question.
what about these? Look familiar?
don't answer that.
who was living with Rachel?
Mr...Frye,
if I leave here without a believable response, I am gonna arrest your client for murder.
and guilty or not, this movie that starts rehearsing tomorrow will have to find someone else to play the part.
or with a little cooperation, the show can go on.
it's your choice.
you can tell her that you didn't know where Rachel was living.
I don't know where Rachel was living or who was living with her.
I didn't threaten Donna.
we had a disagreement about what she was saying to my wife, that's all.
another disagreement that you conveniently forgot to tell me.
so you lied to me again.
I loved my wife.
she was my world.
so, then why won't you help me?
cause you keep treating me like I'm a criminal!
Ryan, it's okay.
you loved Rachel so much?
then what exactly are you doing right now
that could possibly be more important than helping me find her murderer?
I am out here trying to work.
I - I am studying my part, hoping to god that I get out of here in time to play it.
more specifically, I am highlighting my lines, which is what all actors do when they first get their script.
Ryan, it's okay.
look, uh, no more questions about this homicide.
you want to make an arrest?
lieutenant... Those script pages that we found at Rachel's apartment -- where are they?
got them right here.
okay. - Here you go.
who would play this role where the words are all yellow?
hello.
Callie Rivers?
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson of the L. A.P. D.
Yes.
sorry for my appearance.
slept in today.
I understand you recently guest-starred on "trauma unit.
I did, yes.
the episode hasn't aired yet, but yes. Why?
well, I was hoping that you'd be able to answer a few questions about Rachel Hughes.
she was a hairdresser
Yes, I-I heard about what happened to her.
so sorry.
unfortunately, I didn't know her that well, so...
you didn't?
because we found some of your things at her apartment.
that.
uh, w-well, I-I did stay with Rachel very briefly, but she was never there.
she worked, like, 16 hours a day on that show, so...
do you mind if we come in?
uh, w-well...
well, i - it's a mess right now.
I understand.
what do you want to know?
well, there's a lot, actually.
like why were you staying with Rachel?
she -- she said she was afraid of her husband and she wanted some company.
it made her feel safe.
so, she must have told you that her husband beat her.
Yeah, a little bit, yeah.
did she also explain to you how she got away from Ryan?
how she just walked out and left him?
No!
let her go! - Please, no!
you let her go now!
I'll break her neck, I swear! Do you hear me?
back off! Back off! I mean it! Back off!
I'll kill her! I mean it. I will kill her.
I'll break her neck, I swear! Do you hear me?
let her go now! Now!
okay, okay.
no, please. Please don't hurt him.
he didn't mean to kill her.
shut up, you stupid bitch! Shut up! Shut up!
easy!
whoever you are, you are under arrest for the murder of Rachel Hughes.
considering the circumstances,
your lawyer requested that we offer you an explanation of
what happened to your wife and perhaps offer an apology.
first, let's start with the murder.
your wife, having been physically abused herself,
recognized similar injuries in Callie Rivers,
a guest star on the aptly named "trauma unit.
Rachel then convinced Callie to run away from her abusive boyfriend, Mark, just like she had run away from you.
looking for Callie, Mark threatened your wife, very much like you confronted Donna.
when Rachel stood up for Callie, refusing to tell Mark where she was, he beat her to death.
Rachel was murdered protecting somebody else?
Yeah, she was.
and now to finish up here, on behalf of the entire L. A.P. D.
allow me to say how sorry I am that you lied to us so much
and that you knocked your wife around to such an extent that we considered you a suspect in her murder.
that's your apology?
you people have no idea what I'm going through, do you?
excuse me.
I'd still like to arrest him.
odds are one day... We will.
don't forget your shampoos.
Oh, thank you, honey.
just when I was wondering what would make showering in that rv any worse.
there's nothing wrong with the shower in that rv.
daddy...
I just want to say that Fritz and I are gonna get married when we're ready and not one minute before.
it's -- it's our business, and I won't be rushed into setting a date or a place by anyone.
I'm not trying to rush you into anything.
you've been engaged over a year.
we couldn't rush you now even if we wanted to.
just so I know it's been said, I want to tell you both -- But especially you, daddy
I'm gonna get married when I want and the way I want to.
and the next time we talk about my wedding, it had better be because I brought it up.
well, so much for freedom of speech.
am I still allowed to take y'all to dinner?
Yes. That would be very nice.
good.
well, go get dressed and try to treat the waiter better than you do me.
that was inspiring the way you stood up to your father just now.
you really think so?
sometimes the only way to deal with a control freak is to lay down the law.
I totally agree.
which is why I'm saying I want to be married by the end of January or February of next year at the latest.
and the next time we talk about it, you better have a date in mind.
clay, why are you using that thing to cut a coffee cake? Here.
y'all come and get it while it's still hot!
who else is coming for breakfast?
Switzerland?
don't be silly.
shopped in Palm Springs yesterday.
made breakfast in L. A.this morning.
I just love that rv.
we're gonna go from here up to Alaska and then come back through the Yukon territory.
we'll be done by thanksgiving.
Oh, unless we need to come back sooner, you know?
I hear Canada's pretty in the fall.
clay, we talked about this.
it doesn't matter when they get married as long as they're happy.
anybody want some more biscuits and gravy?
you know what makes me happy?
weddings.
I just love weddings.
don't you like weddings, son?
the phone.
Hello?
Oh, yes, sergeant. Morning.
okay. Where?
Y- yes. Uh, okay, fine. I- i'll be right there.
I'm so sorry to cut this short, but there's been a murder at a movie studio.
and -- and this was such a great breakfast, too. I...
honey...
I thought we had an agreement that you would never leave me alone with your parents again.
Oh, I had no choice, Fritz.
and I didn't even know they were coming until they showed up last night.
I got it.
I -- special agent Fritz Howard, FBI. Oh, you're kidding.
Oh, that's - that's - no, horrible. Oh, that is bad. Horrible.
no, no, no. I'll be there as soon as possible. Okay.
there's a bomb threat at the airport.
well, this has got to be the most dangerous city on the planet earth.
no, I-I'm on my way.
but we can't leave mama and daddy here by themselves. - Honey
Brenda Leigh, don't worry about us. We'll be fine. Won't we, dear?
Yeah, and there's no reason why they can't come along with one of us.
what would you guys rather do?
you can come with me now, spend a few hours in a makeshift tent watching an extremely slow-moving robot,
or you can head off to a Hollywood movie studio. Either way.
Oh, goodness.
is this where they do "dancing with the stars"?
I'd like to welcome you to vintage studios.
I'll be your tour guide.
my name is mike. - Bye. Bye, y'all.
I'm gonna take your picture. - Have fun.
how nice.
our, uh, victim's name is Rachel Hughes.
she's a 33-year-old white female.
she works as a, uh, hair stylist on "Trauma Unit."
it's a television show.
films here on the lot.
we've already started criminal-background checks on all the cast and crew members.
where was the body found?
she was stuffed in a jockey box.
that's what they call the, uh, storage lockers underneath the truck.
this morning, an electrician went into this particular jockey box,
looking for some extra cable.
found her inside.
okay.
defensive wounds on her knuckles.
scrape marks on her elbows and ankles.
there's scuff marks on the sides of her shoes and heels.
so she was dragged.
Yeah, there's a trail of blood that leads from the hair-and-makeup trailer to this one here.
Oh, these marks here.
did the coroner's investigator say what caused them?
no.
and no one heard screaming?
according to studio security, no one heard a thing.
Oh, uh, Rachel stayed late after filming stopped yesterday - not a lot of people around.
and we know this how?
well, Rachel shared a trailer with a makeup artist - Kim Reynolds.
and Kim left last night around 8: 00 p. m.
she said that Rachel was waiting for someone.
any idea who?
makeup girl - uh, woman - said that Rachel was hanging out waiting for one of her private clients.
no name, huh?
well, according to this makeup girl - Uh, woman
Rachel was the kind of person who kept her schedule on her cellphone,
which she left at home yesterday.
now, Rachel's keys are missing, but her car is still here.
did Rachel have a boyfriend or a husband?
anyone come looking for her?
Yeah, detective Daniels is checking on that now.
all right. Thank you.
well, whoever attacked Rachel -- they slammed her head up against the mirror.
and she didn't get a chance to clean up after her private client.
and it looks like all this hair is from the same head.
Yeah, and we have an idea whose head it might be.
Rachel Hughes was married.
but six months ago, she filed for divorce and had a restraing order issued against her husband, Ryan.
security logs. This is everybody who entered the lot in the last 24 hours.
now, guess who dropped by for a visit.
last night -- 8: 24 p. m.
looks like Rachel's husband wasn't taking his restraing order very seriously.
where does he live?
no new address for him anywhere.
all right. Sergeant Gabriel, lieutenant Flynn, let's head over to the victim's house and find that cellphone.
is that a current address?
uh, the address on the restraining order matches the one on her driver's license.
okay. Lieutenant provenza, would you please organize some interviews with all the people - Who were at the studio last night? - Okay.
and, detective Daniels, would you and detective sanchez please find Ryan Hughes for me?
I'd rather like to talk to him.
Oh, that blood looks so real.
clay, smile.
thank you.
lieutenant Provenza, you remember my parents.
well, of course.
Hello, there, Rillie Ray. Clay.
to what do we owe this pleasure?
I think somebody got murdered.
y'all are finished with the tour? Already?
Oh, it was just like a dream of a big trailer lot.
well, uh, I need to run an errand,
but lieutenant Provenza will organize a ride for y'all back to the office.
Oh, I'll do better than that, chief.
how would the two of you like to watch some filming?
Oh, my goodness, my goodness. Really?
come on, Willie Ray.
let me show you where the magic happens.
lieutenant, I'll bet you say that to all the girls.
I bet he does say that to all the girls.
I know his type.
how long you gonna be?
I just need to hop by the victim's house.
you'll hardly know I'm gone.
God, you scared the crap out of me.
so sorry. Excuse me.
Hi, i'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh johnson from the L. A. P. D. And you are?
it's so nice to meet you, sir.
we thought, uh -- we were looking for your wife.
Rachel doesn't live here anymore.
and I was on my way to the gym, so...
well, maybe you could help us then.
can we come in, ask you a few questions?
do you have a warrant? - No.
out here's good.
what do you want to know?
when was the last time you saw your wife?
uh, I don't remember, exactly.
do you know how to get in touch with her?
she works on a television show -- "Trauma Unit."
she's not there today.
okay, then. Try her cellphone.
no answer. Where is she staying, sir?
look, my wife and I are separated.
she won't even give me her new address.
is that because of the restraing order issued against you?
nice haircut, champ.
Rachel's work, I take it.
from last night, right? Isn't that why your name's on the security list?
I knew it! - Take it easy.
she told me I could be there, okay?
well, she didn't like the way the visit ended.
Ryan Hughes, you're under arrest for the violation of your restraing order.
hands behind your back, please.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you by the state.
there have anyone from the L. A. P. D.at this airport bombing, not a single officer.
uh, we're not at L. A. We're in Ontario.
ontario.
Hey, look, we're trying to keep this low-profile.
so try not mentioning it to everyone you know, okay?
detective Sanchez is still completely out of it because of the death of his brother.
and what am I supposed to do with my parents?
I've got a suspect in the interview room who probably beat his wife to death last night.
probably?
well, when can you come home?
honey, I-I can't leave the mobile command unit until we know there's no bomb out here.
besides, Willie Ray and Clay are old enough to stay in our apartment for a few hours by themselves.
we have cable.
Oh, no. I don't want them at the apartment by themselves.
they'll -- they'll do things.
I'll take care of your parents, chief.
no. I can't impose on you again. We're working.
I'm losing another 15 sick days next month.
look, you've arrested the husband. This case is effectively over.
all right, fine.
Fritz... - Yeah.
lieutenant Provenza has volunteered to take care of my poor parents, so thanks so much for your help.
lieutenant, are you sure about this?
Oh, chief. Now, the suspect will be in tears in 20 minutes.
hold his hand, write him up, the end.
honey, I think your mother and I ought to go on and get out of your way.
you're not in the way, daddy. Don't be silly.
but if y'all have had enough here,
lieutenant Provenza has kindly offered to drive you back to the apartment.
Oh, no, no, no, no. We don't, uh, want to be in the way. We'll just take a cab.
Oh, I wouldn't hear of it.
chief, you do what you need to do, and I'll entertain your parents.
we don't need entertaining.
I'm entertaining enough on my own.
clay, what's wrong with you?
lieutenant Provenza, we'll drive by the grocery store, and I'll pick up some things for dinner.
Oh, Willie Ray, that sounds wonderful to me.
well, if you're too busy, I guess I'll just have to get to know your friends.
please tell me we found where Rachel Hughes was living.
no one at the studio can tell us, and her paychecks go directly to a p. o.box.
and she never updated her next-of-kin information.
so the guy that we're supposed to notify is her husband.
okay, so, let's use her social security number and see if we can find someone in her family.
maybe she told her parents where she lived, though I don't recommend it.
lieutenant Tao, what about her phone records?
I'm waiting for Rachel's carrier to send me the dump off her cell.
Yeah, what about the husband?
Oh, this is a great guy.
a year ago, he broke Rachel's wrist.
six months ago, he gave her a concussion.
and a day later, she checked out of the e. r.
and then took the restraing order out on her husband and filed for divorce.
and left her own house?
though she's still paying the mortgage.
why on earth would she do that?
I'm guessing, but Ryan hasn't made any money lately.
this year, he guest-starred in one sitcom and one drama
not even enough to make his health insurance.
so he's an actor.
Yes, and a bartender -- two shifts a week.
Rachel was the one with the steady paycheck.
maybe she left Ryan the house because he couldn't afford to go anywhere else.
so what? He was beating her. Why did she move? And where did she move to?
excuse me, but chief Pope and commander Taylor are here.
uh, thank you, Buzz. I'll be right there.
sergeant Gabriel, would you meet me in the interview room, please?
and will somebody find me Rachel's address? Thank you.
what can I do for you, gentlemen?
uh, you, uh, like the husband for this, right?
maybe.
though I need to figure out how he had a major knock-down,
drag-out with his wife and kept his skin smoother than mine.
he's smarter than your average abuser.
wouldn't let us into his house without a search warrant.
and if he really doesn't know that his wife is dead,
well, The Times, and specifically our old friend Ricardo Ramos,
seems to have developed the opinion that we only deploy priority homicide when the victims are rich, white, and/or related to police officers.
and our ace reporter called me this morning,
asking if we had added show-business murders to the list.
this guy's an actor, right?
Yes, but not a famous one.
he could be tomorrow.
am in trouble for something? - No, no, no.
no, no, no. You're doing an incredible job. That's not the issue.
the issue for Ramos is, uh, who gets priority treatment from the police and who doesn't. That's all.
for example, we have several investigators who deal exclusively with domestic-abuse issues,
and I didn't deploy one of them to the studio. I sent you.
well, we didn't know this was a domestic-abuse case until after we identified the victim.
that's a good point, sir.
but how do we avoid the impression that we made this murder a priority because of the Hollywood connection?
but that is why it's a priority, isn't it?
Yeah, that and the reporters flying in helicopters over the studio, sir.
Yeah, but we don't want to say any of that.
tell Ramos that we're hoping that Rachel's murder was an isolated incident
and not someone breaking into studio lots and killing people.
that might stop Ramos.
stop him from what?
nothing. Never mind.
you know, uh, tired of being pushed around by The Times.
just, uh, get on with what you need to get done here.
okay.
thank you.
you know this is one big setup, right?
how's that, sir?
well, why else would Rachel tell me to stop by for a haircut and then report me to the police?
she wants to use this to screw me in the divorce...
Oh, I doubt that. - And ruin my career.
you know, I'm unfamiliar with your business, sir.
do two extremely small jobs a year make a career?
I'll leave my curiosity about the part-time actor's life aside.
let's talk about last night.
what's to talk about?
I got a part on a big feature film.
she told me to come -- she volunteered to cut my hair.
and while you were there, did you guys -- did you have an argument?
did she take a little too much off the top?
no. We didn't have an argument.
you know, it's hard to believe that he didn't work more, because you are just so convincing.
look, I just got a part on a big studio film, so
wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's -- let's start again.
let's start again, and this time,
I want you to remember that those hair-and-makeup trailers have very thin walls
and people hear things all the time.
did you argue with your wife, sir?
we had a small disagreement.
what about? - Look...
I have done everything that Rachel has asked me to do.
I even apologized for every single argument that we ever had
and I took those anger-management classes Donna recommended.
who's Donna?
her friend, Donna.
I never met her.
I don't even know her last name,
but it still doesn't stop Donna from convincing my wife that I'm an asshole, which I'm not.
I mean, I'm passionate, okay? I'm sensitive.
that's what all good actors are supposed to be.
but I love my wife, which is why I have stayed away from her, just like she asked.
but you didn't stay away from her, sir.
you saw her last -- because she told me I could!
if I were you, sir, I'd put my ass back in that chair.
well, I think it's safe to say that you are a freshman in anger management.
so, I'm supposed to believe that after you give your wife a concussion and broke her wrist, she called you up and said,"hey, come on over for a haircut"?
a haircut you felt the need to lie about?
here we go.
I didn't want to get in any trouble, okay?
is that how you usually avoid trouble? You just lie to the police?
look, I made a mistake, okay?
a mistake?
like violating your restraining order or lying to me about last night?
I did not violate the spirit of the order.
tell me, how many mistakes did it take before your wife ended up like this?
Oh, my...
is she dead?
not just dead -- murdered...
savagely beaten.
and to me, it looks like someone was very angry.
I - I want a lawyer.
fine.
sergeant, will you please see that Mr. Hughes here gets his phone call?
chief Johnson was wrong about one thing.
what?
this guy's a much better actor than we thought.
so nice of you to drive Clay and Willie Ray around to all these different wedding facilities, lieutenant.
Oh, I enjoyed it.
it reminded me of when I was young and stupid.
Brenda, where's your appetite?
well, darling, she's still thinking about the murder.
I am... a little.
the victim surprises me.
on the one hand, she stood up for herself and got legal action.
and on the other, she handed over her house to a bully.
I guess I just don't understand that kind of relationship.
I'll tell you one thing.
if your mother raised her hand against me, I'd be out the door.
well, you and Willie Ray have a great marriage, Clay,
which just goes to prove that the institution doesn't have to be a complete horror show.
actually, my third wife and I had one fantastic weekend.
of course, that was before the wedding, but still.
now, my fourth marriage -- oh, lord.
honey, don't listen to him.
here, uh, this will take your mind off work.
look at that beautiful little chapel there.
now, if you're determined not to get
excuse me. I'm -- I'm sorry. I'll be right back.
clay, I told you about this.
this what?
it's a chapel.
you can use a chapel for any number of things.
for example, if they don't get married pretty soon, y'all can congregate there for my funeral.
all right, that's enough.
Fritz, Brenda looked upset.
did she? I'll see.
happily ever after resort and casino.
talk about bad odds.
if I hear one more mention of weddings or chapels, I swear I'm going to kill someone.
he's just excited. That's all.
you don't understand my daddy.
when he wants something, he will not stop until he gets it. Trust me on this.
so, it runs in the family then.
here's what I don't get.
you are so tough at work, and here, you come home.
you're sitting at your own dining-room table.
your father pushes you around a little bit.
and instead of saying, "don't do that to me," you come hide in the kitchen.
lieutenant Flynn...
I'm so sorry to bother you this late.
you know that emergency room where Rachel Hughes went for her concussion?
I want you to check for domestic-violence shelters in the area.
see if there's one that the hospital recommend
I'm particularly interested in any with a Donna working on-site.
okay, thank you.
this is what Rachel looked like the first night she arrived.
Ryan did that to her for buying a brass lamp when he was hoping for new headshots.
well, as hard as it is to believe, she looks even worse now.
I could tell he wasn't gonna change.
you met him?
somehow he found out that she'd come here.
and one night, he stopped me in the parking lot and waved like we'd met.
well, he seemed -- you know, he's very charming.
and he was in my face before I realized that he was threatening me.
thank god we have a guard posted nearby.
wait, wait. You said he threatened you? He threatened you how?
I had insisted that Rachel get her own place and not give the address to anyone.
she followed my advice, which made Ryan furious.
that's why she had a p. o.box - Right.
that's one of the first things they learn, the women who come here -- to defend their privacy.
and Rachel participated in our volunteer programs.
we always need volunteers.
we've got more women than we can ever accommodate.
well, I know you don't usually give out this kind of information,
but Rachel doesn't need you to keep her address a secret anymore,
and we could really use it.
actually, she gave me a spare key to her apartment.
I'll take you there myself.
so, if Ryan didn't break the door down, how did he get in?
Rachel's keys were missing from the crime scene.
so he just unlocked the door and walked in.
but if Rachel was keeping her new address a secret, how did he know to come here?
did Rachel have something Ryan wanted?
not that I know of. - Chief...
blood on the base.
how did we end up at another crime scene?
maybe Ryan beat up Rachel here and drove her back to the studio and then beat her again.
with an interruption for a haircut?
okay, maybe after the haircut, he follows her home, kills her here.
and drove her back to the studio past security?
dragging Rachel's body from the makeup trailer to the jockey box?
okay, Daniels, why don't you just figure it out?
so, he kills Rachel, maybe to get the keys.
but how did he know what door they'd open?
look at this. Flynn, here, here. Read this with me here.
uh, you do the highlighted parts. I'll do the doctor.
what? I'm gonna do the broad's role? - Yeah.
he's dying, ma'am. We've done all we can.
you've got to do something, doc. Please, anything. Be my hero.
be my hero.
gentlemen, the cellphone. Please.
okay, I'll check the bedroom, chief.
strands of blond hair.
blond hair?
Rachel wasn't a blonde.
maybe the blood isn't hers, either.
did, uh -- did rachel have a roommate?
Oh, my god.
what is it?
Rachel called me last week and asked if we had room available for someone she'd just met.
we didn't.
but you said Rachel volunteers sometimes.
she may have taken someone in.
thank you.
Oh, for heaven sakes. This one isn't like mine.
chief, I got it. - Oh, thank you.
I need Rachel's schedule for the night before last. Please.
Ryan -- haircut, 8:00.
so, maybe he wasn't lying.
so, Ryan Hughes kills his wife, somehow finds this address, and then comes here.
fights with someone else, doesn't get a scratch on him either time?
but who does he fight with?
I think we need to start looking for another victim.
Oh, yeah.
I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson, and this is sergeant gabriel.
Yeah. I, uh, saw you yesterday, but I had already spoken to that cute detective Sanchez.
I was hoping that you could tell me if Rachel Hughes had a roommate.
Oh, um, I wouldn't know really.
uh, she and I weren't that close.
did you guys not get along or something?
no. I mean, her whole relationship with Ryan just drove me crazy.
and, honestly, it was all she talked about. I -- I don't know.
maybe I should have paid more attention.
did Rachel tell you that she had moved?
Yeah, yeah.
did she tell you where she moved?
no, no, no. That was like some kind of, like,"rule" or something.
like, nobody could know where she lived.
you know what, though?
um, you guys should really talk to Lindsay.
she knew Rachel way better than me.
is this lindsay?
Yeah. She's our new hair stylist.
well, thank you. Thank you so much. - Sure.
you were very helpful. - Oh, I try.
you know, actually, if you, um...
if you think of anything else, you give me a call.
Oh, okay, I will.
all right, thanks. - Okay.
pardon me. Lindsay?
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
I understand that you were friends with Rachel Hughes.
Oh, uh, yeah.
I subbed for Rachel when she was in the hospital.
did you spend a lot of time with Rachel lately?
not really. Her hours were so extreme.
funny, I...
I so wanted to be the head of the hair department somewhere.
wish it wasn't here.
Lindsay, do you always display your cosmetology license?
we're required to post it where we work. State law.
thank you.
you were right, chief.
Rachel's cosmetology license has her new address on it.
and the card stock it was printed on matches the same bit we found on her mirror at the crime scene.
Yeah, she had that license out for the whole world to see.
Yeah, but Lindsay told us she taped up the bottom half of it in order to hide her address.
and someone ripped it down.
okay, so, we've got two crime scenes, two victims,
and a suspect who fought both without one defensive wound.
well, maybe 'cause he was wearing these.
sap gloves.
we had them on the streets back in the '80s.
they'll leave the same square marks we found on rachel's face.
I knew those welts looked familiar.
embedded steel. Protects your fists.
Yeah, well, that explains pretty boy's silk knuckles.
all right, lieutenant Flynn, let's see if we can track down the companies that make these gloves.
maybe we'll get lucky, and one of them will have an order for a Ryan Hughes.
you got it, chief. - Thank you.
what the hell is he reading?
a movie script. His attorney brought it in for him.
he's supposed to start rehearsals for it tomorrow.
chief Johnson, I have something unusual to suggest to you.
um, given that the suspect has lawyered up and the circumstantial evidence against him is so strong,
I think that we should arrest Mr. Hughes for murder right now and hand him over to the D. A.
without a confession? Why?
because of what Ramos might write in The Times? - No, no, no.
from the outside, this crime looks all kind of showbiz-y.
but the second -- the second we make an arrest,
the murder becomes a domestic dispute between a hair stylist and a wannabe actor, and...
that's not news in Los Angeles.
let me give you the whole picture here.
ricardo Ramos is writing a two-part article, as we speak, on priority homicide.
now, I have done everything I can to kill this article on the basis that it's one-sided, unfair, and bad for the city.
anyway, I failed.
the article will come.
it will be terrible.
let me talk to Ramos.
I don't think that would be -- No. Absolutely not.
then explain to him that there is another crime scene associated with this so-called Hollywood victim
and that if I give up today due to unwarranted media pressure,
then I'll be short a dead body when we go to trial.
or tell him that
for heaven's sakes.
you know, I can't let Ramos dictate how I do my job.
she just doesn't get it, does she?
she doesn't want to get it.
hello.
I'm deputy chief brenda Leigh Johnson.
Dan Frye. I represent Mr. Hughes. And I've talked to my client, and I'd like you to explain why he's still being held without any charges being filed.
well, maybe there won't be any, if I can get a few things explained.
like what?
well, your client claimed that he didn't know Donna Taft,
from the support center for domestic violence, when, in fact,
he threatened Donna when she would not tell him where his wife
unrelated, no evidentiary value. Next question.
what about these? Look familiar?
don't answer that.
who was living with Rachel?
Mr..."Frye,"
if I leave here without a believable response, I am gonna arrest your client for murder.
and guilty or not, this movie that starts rehearsing tomorrow will have to find someone else to play the part.
or with a little cooperation, the show can go on.
it's your choice.
you can tell her that you didn't know where Rachel was living.
I don't know where Rachel was living or who was living with her.
I didn't threaten Donna.
we had a disagreement about what she was saying to my wife, that's all.
another disagreement that you conveniently forgot to tell me.
so you lied to me again.
I loved my wife.
she was my world.
so, then why won't you help me?
cause you keep treating me like I'm a criminal!
Ryan, it's okay.
you loved Rachel so much?
then what exactly are you doing right now
that could possibly be more important than helping me find her murderer?
I am out here trying to work.
I - I am studying my part, hoping to god that I get out of here in time to play it.
more specifically, I am highlighting my lines, which is what all actors do when they first get their script.
Ryan, it's okay.
look, uh, no more questions about this homicide.
you want to make an arrest?
lieutenant... Those script pages that we found at rachel's apartment -- where are they?
got them right here.
okay. - Here you go.
who would play this role where the words are all yellow?
hello.
Callie Rivers?
I'm deputy chief brenda Leigh Johnson of the l. a.p. d.
Yes.
sorry for my appearance.
slept in today.
I understand you recently guest-starred on "Trauma Unit."
I did, yes.
the episode hasn't aired yet, but yes. Why?
well, I was hoping that you'd be able to answer a few questions about Rachel Hughes.
she was a hairdresser
Yes, I-I heard about what happened to her.
so sorry.
unfortunately, I didn't know her that well, so...
you didn't?
because we found some of your things at her apartment.
that.
uh, w-well, I-I did stay with Rachel very briefly, but she was never there.
she worked, like, 16 hours a day on that show, so...
do you mind if we come in?
uh, w-well...
well, I - it's a mess right now.
I understand.
what do you want to know?
well, there's a lot, actually.
like why were you staying with Rachel?
she -- she said she was afraid of her husband and she wanted some company.
it made her feel safe.
so, she must have told you that her husband beat her.
Yeah, a little bit, yeah.
did she also explain to you how she got away from Ryan?
how she just walked out and left him?
No!
let her go! - Please, no!
you let her go now!
I'll break her neck, I swear! Do you hear me?
back off! Back off! I mean it! Back off!
I'll kill her! I mean it. I will kill her.
I'll break her neck, I swear. Do you hear me?
let her go now! Now!
okay, okay.
no, please. Please don't hurt him.
he didn't mean to kill her.
shut up, you stupid bitch! Shut up! Shut up!
easy!
whoever you are, you are under arrest for the murder of Rachel Hughes.
considering the circumstances,
your lawyer requested that we offer you an explanation of what happened to your wife and perhaps offer an apology.
first, let's start with the murder.
your wife, having been physically abused herself,
recognized similar injuries in Callie Rivers,
a guest star on the aptly named "Trauma Unit."
Rachel then convinced Callie to run away from her abusive boyfriend, Mark, just like she had run away from you.
looking for Callie, Mark threatened your wife, very much like you confronted Donna.
when Rachel stood up for Callie, refusing to tell Mark where she was, he beat her to death.
Rachel was murdered protecting somebody else?
Yeah, she was.
and now to finish up here, on behalf of the entire L. A.P. D.
allow me to say how sorry I am that you lied to us so much
and that you knocked your wife around to such an extent that we considered you a suspect in her murder.
that's your apology?
you people have no idea what I'm going through, do you?
excuse me.
I'd still like to arrest him.
odds are one day... We will.
don't forget your shampoos.
Oh, thank you, honey.
just when I was wondering what would make showering in that rv any worse.
there's nothing wrong with the shower in that rv.
daddy...
I just want to say that Fritz and I are gonna get married when we're ready and not one minute before.
it's -- it's our business, and I won't be rushed into setting a date or a place by anyone.
I'm not trying to rush you into anything.
you've been engaged over a year.
we couldn't rush you now even if we wanted to.
just so I know it's been said, I want to tell you both -- But especially you, daddy
I'm gonna get married when I want and the way I want to.
and the next time we talk about my wedding, it had better be because I brought it up.
well, so much for freedom of speech.
am I still allowed to take y'all to dinner?
Yes. That would be very nice.
good.
well, go get dressed and try to treat the waiter better than you do me.
that was inspiring the way you stood up to your father just now.
you really think so?
sometimes the only way to deal with a control freak is to lay down the law.
I totally agree.
which is why I'm saying I want to be married by the end of January or February of next year at the latest.
and the next time we talk about it, you better have a date in mind.
through this anointing, may the Lord, in his love and mercy,
help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit.
may the Lord, who frees you from sin, save you and raise you up.
through this anointing, may the Lord, in his love and mercy,
help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit.
may the Lord, who frees you from sin, save you and raise you up.
Yes, I'd like to report two men shot to death lying in the back of a pickup truck under the sixth street bridge and Anderson.
morning, chief Johnson.
so, what's all this?
two Tijuana police officers shot to death in this pickup.
jacinto Gonzales, Carlos Gomez.
is that why you called priority homicide, commander?
dead foreign police officers can only be investigated by "the elite"?
I had nothing to do with the article in The Times Today referring to PHD as "elite,"
and you can tell Flynn because I've never used the word "elite" to describe you.
okay, okay, okay.
come.
we're gonna have to respond to that article in The Times, but everything Ramos wrote was trash.
well, chief Pope seems to be taking it seriously.
he wants me in his office an hour ago.
why is the coroner's investigator just getting here now?
lots of dead people on Monday.
and if no one's touched the bodies, how do we know their IDs?
wallets, passports, badges were all laid out in plain view.
also in the driver's seat -- guns.
this isn't the crime scene.
so, wait. Some body drove the bodies here?
Where's this vehicle from?
the vehicle is registered to a San Diego address.
the police down there say the owner, a Mr. Raul llamas,
didn't even know the vehicle was stolen till they told him this morning.
so two Tijuana police officers murdered elsewhere are driven underneath a bridge in Los Angeles
and abandoned in a stolen pickup truck.
that's so strange.
who found the bodies?
the guy who called it in didn't identify himself,
but the cellphone's registered to a father Chris Donahue.
Oh, great.
what was father Donahue doing in a place like this at 6: 00 in the morning?
I have no idea, but there's a Catholic church four blocks away
our lady of the saints.
uh, chief.
I think we got something here.
and it's seriously weird.
now we got a whole list of seriously weird stuff going.
just another drug murder in Los Angeles.
you recognize these bracelets, detective?
uh, it's related to the Ochoa Cartel.
all their people wear them.
it means that our victims are probably dirty cops.
both men dead about six to nine hours
and showing multiple gunshot wounds from what looks like a 45
okay, thank you.
gentlemen. Thank you so much.
okay, detective Sanchez, let's let the Tijuana police know that they've lost two of their officers.
maybe they could tell us how they got here in the first place.
lieutenant Flynn, let's get a dope dog to go over this truck.
see if anything floats its boat.
after which, lieutenant Tao, if you could take it to the print shed? Thank you.
sergeant Gabriel, I want "shots fired" reports from L. A. county for last night.
I need a crime scene in the very worst way.
chief. Look here.
olive oil.
detective Daniels, that priest that called this in,
he didn't just find the bodies -- He also performed last rites.
I'd like him in my office, please, posthaste.
father Donahue doesn't have to talk to you if he doesn't want to.
and when you want to interact with the Catholic church, you need to go through a deputy chief.
I am a deputy chief.
Yeah, I mean, you know, a real, grown-up deputy chief with management and administrative duties
like Dennis Murdoch, who is LAPD's liaison with the archdiocese.
have you read The Times Today -- this article by Ramos?
I glanced through it, yes.
anything leap out at you?
he misspelled my middle name.
what about this? Here. Here.
deputy chief Brenda Lee Johnson confesses "that 90%" of the time,
priority homicide division is deployed by her superiors in an attempt to anticipate media coverage.
did you actually say this?
of course not! He took my words out of context. - You accused me of allowing the press to run this department!
wait a minute, Will. Now, wait a minute.
the main point of this article is that PHD handles more white murder victims than robbery/homicide,
and that has nothing to do with me.
that's how you assign cases.
in addition to which, having a reporter popping in and out of my division was your idea, not mine.
you want to know what else was my idea? You!
you were my idea.
priority Homicide was my idea.
and so imagine how much fun it's been explaining your comments to angry members of the police commission,
all of whom are now demanding that I dismantle your division.
do you understand what that means?
Yes. Yes, of course. - Come in.
we need to -- indeed to explain things better to
no, no, no. No!
I admit we need to talk to this asshole, Ramos,
because there's a big "part 1" under the headline of this article,
and we don't want part 2, which comes out next week, to end as badly.
but the time for simple explanations has come and gone.
LAPD needs to get ahead of this story, chief Johnson.
priority Homicide has established the efficacy of team investigation.
we need to apply that lesson to the rest of our force structure.
a - and translated, that means what, exactly?
priority Homicide has run its course. It's over. It's done.
I'm shutting it down.
wha-- what?
b - because of this story? Really?
w- what's gonna happen to my detectives? And -- and -- and when?
when? You want to know when? Now! Today!
by the time Ramos gets here this evening,
the commander and I will have reconfigured LAPD's various homicide units in such a way
that they will withstand both criticism from the police commission - As well as any further media scrutiny. - Okay.
you will retain your rank and salary,
but you will no longer be in charge of anything called Priority Homicide.
and for now, that's it.
you're dismissed.
LAPD Chief Admits Priority Given in Certain Homicide Cases
chief Murdoch spoke with the archdiocese.
they say father Donahue will call us when he has a minute.
okay.
well, we got a minute.
um, what do we know about him -- father Donahue?
well, he has a small church in one of the poorer sections of the city -- our lady of the saints.
runs it alone, and he's been questioned several times by immigration officials.
they believe he provides sanctuary for illegals.
um, Sanchez, we hear from Tijuana?
they're sending some comandante to do their own investigation,
but our victims here, Jacinto Gonzales and Carlos Gomez, had no official business here in Los Angeles.
but they had weapons.
uh, lieutenant Flynn, what did our dope dog think?
Oh, he was unimpressed, but there was some dried blood behind the seats in the truck's cab.
Sid's still working on matching it up and isolating fingerprints.
and, uh, we may have something here, chief -- uh, an unresolved "shots fired" report.
last night at around 3: 00 a. m.
central division responds to an anonymous call reporting a gunfight just east of the train station.
our guys drove through the area, stopped and talked to several security guards, didn't find anything.
but all of them admit to hearing something,
except for the night watchman at Manta Chemical Company -- uh, a Mateo Hernandez.
Yeah, I,uh, I put a want on him while you were in with Pope.
now, as it turns out, the address on his driver's license doesn't exist.
also, Mateo's 40, and it says he's supposedly born here in L.A.
but his social security number is only two months old.
what about vehicle registration?
he has a car. He left it at work last night. Hasn't come back for it.
but we do have two undercovers watching it right now.
so Mateo Hernandez is either a deaf illegal immigrant or...
his job site is our crime scene.
let's head over to Manta Chemical and have a look-see.
good.
Oh, and, um...
excellent work, everybody... As always.
really.
always really excellent work.
excuse me for interrupting, but DOJ says you guys made an inquiry on Mateo Hernandez.
are you saying that the FBI has a flag on Mateo?
Why? Where is he?
we can't find him just this second.
but this want is a bad thing.
I'm not authorized to tell you anything about Mateo,
except he's helped us roll up the American side of some major drug trafficking,
and he is a seriously good guy.
well, you should come with me, then.
cause I don't want to cause you any more problems at work,
but your "seriously good guy" just became my chief suspect in a double homicide.
a - and I should say that all of Mateo's paperwork was in order.
we filed it with the government.
that's all right, Mr. Gooding. We're not from immigration.
and he was a real self-starter, too.
not just sitting around at night.
h- he -- he burglar-proofed the windows, he -- he fixed our alarms.
he even double-bolted the loading door a- at the end of business every day.
and this shelving...
well, when I left work last night, this was all in rows in the center of the room.
uh, I guess Mateo must have moved it up against the walls.
Oh, and, uh, this is his desk right over here.
I didn't know him personally, but from what I was told,
Mateo was just not the kind of guy who would cause the sort of problem you found this morning.
I disagree.
why is that?
because there's two casings right here between the shelves.
from a. 45
for those in the know, nothing better in the handgun biz.
our Lady of...
chief.
wasn't something like this used to tape down the tarp on the truck?
Yes. - chief. Look what I found.
the water in this bucket has blood in it.
looks like he tried to mop the blood up off the floor.
Yeah, but why not wipe the walls down, too?
why just put shelves in front of it?
maybe he, uh, ran out of time.
the lock on this door has been taken apart from the inside.
Mr. Gooding, when did that happen?
uh, it wasn't like that when I left yesterday.
so the bodies were already here
when the squad car pulled up to check on the "shots fired" report.
Mateo actually went outside and spoke to the responding officers,
tells them he doesn't hear a gunfight while the victims are lying here on the floor?
when the police left, Mateo was afraid that they might come back,
so he stopped cleaning up, he pushed the shelves up against the wall,
he dragged his victims out into the stolen truck and drives them...
four blocks...
from his church.
all right, this business about not talking to the priest is getting ridiculous.
father Donahue has had his minute.
C - chief! Look, just hold on a second.
we can ask father Donahue to come visit us.
I mean, but walking into his church and demanding to see him?
that would raise holy hell right now.
I don't think it matters anymore what kind of hell we raise, honestly.
okay, okay, chief.
we all read the article in The Times this morning.
we understand.
it's not good.
so now is not the best time to pick a battle with the Catholic church.
let's fight one pope at a time.
the FBI's getting ready to fax over some declassified stuff on Mateo to your murder room.
see? W - we got plenty to do.
what's going on? Is pope really giving you grief about this article?
I thought it had more to do with his problems than yours.
I can't talk about this right now -- really.
chief, eight sets of prints inside the pickup.
two match our victims, one goes with the prints we found on the car Mateo left at work, and five still unknown.
thank you, lieutenant.
you want to summarize this for everybody? - Sure.
all right, guys, Manuel Rivera, a. k. a. Mateo Hernandez, used to be a Tijuana comandante.
he refused to back off as the Ochoa Cartel,
when they moved in, started buying up the local police.
great. Now the cartels are coming up here to shoot it out.
no, not Mateo.
a year ago, he abandons Mexico,
he drives up to Los Angeles with enough evidence to dismantle half the Ochoa Cartel's American Distribution System.
I think your two vics here were sent by the Cartel to kill him.
okay, how did Gonzales and Gomez know where to find your informant
if the FBI gave Manuel this new identity -- Mateo?
well, Mateo's 18-year-old nephew came to visit last week.
two days after he goes back to Mexico, he's murdered.
and Mateo said the Cartel went after his nephew to find out where we had put him.
Mateo's FBI case officer talked to Mexican federales.
they said the kid was collateral damage in a random gunfight between gangs.
what was his name -- Mateo's nephew?
Ramon Camacho. Why?
well, Mexico posts all its Morgue photos online, and I use it sometimes to locate missing gang members on their database.
there he is -- Ramon Camacho. - Are you kidding me?
cause of death -- blunt-force trauma.
he was beaten, not shot.
probably tortured for information.
and the investigating officers -- Jacinto Gonzales and Carlos Gomez.
our victims. - Great.
that's one way to get away with murder -- investigate it yourself.
so they grab the kid to find out where the uncle lives,
they beat him until he talks, and then they kill him.
and Manuel -- a. k. a. Mateo
hears about this and realizes that they're coming for him.
so Gonzales and Gomez sneak up on him somehow at work.
even have the tape out to put it over his mouth -- same as they did his nephew.
Yeah, but Mateo fought back. I mean, self-defense.
or maybe since he knew his identity had been compromised...
he knew someone was coming, so he was prepared.
he limited access to only one entrance door,
so he knew exactly where Gomez and Gonzales would enter, almost lying in wait for them.
is there anything we can do to help?
well, that depends -- am I finding Mateo so the FBI can swoop down and take him away from me?
not if he committed murder, no.
lieutenant Tao, that dried blood on
on the back of the pickup's cab
I keep bumping on it for some reason.
would you have SID determine if it Matches up to any of our victims, please?
thank you.
chief Johnson.
Yes, commander?
deputy chief Johnson, this is comandante Martin Vasquez from the internal-affairs division of the Tijuana police.
he's here to see about your victims.
thank you for coming, comandante.
let me fill you in on what I know so far.
uh, chief. - Yes?
listen, I,uh, I know how things sounded this morning, but trust me.
I'm -- I'm working all this out.
Yeah. I can tell.
chief, did it ever occur to you that it may not be Priority Homicide the police commission has a problem with?
excuse me, commander?
chief pope is in charge of our race relations here, and it's blowing up in his face.
so maybe instead of getting all pissed off at me,
maybe you should check out how long an assistant chief usually lasts at the LAPD.
I thought you'd want to help me keep our friend from an early retirement.
by giving up my division?
why am I supposed to be the fall guy here?
you know what, commander? I don't want to talk about this with you right now.
pardon me. Excuse me.
this man you're calling Mateo, I know as Manuel Rivera.
how well did you know Manuel Rivera?
we worked together. I trusted him.
do you have any reason to believe that the officers he shot were corrupt?
the operating rule in Tijuana right now is "trust no one."
I know the feeling.
and yet you stay.
to succeed, corruption depends on decent people either giving in or giving up.
and I don't like giving up.
now, Manuel -- he was my friend, but he abandoned his country, he has a new name.
after changing so much, who can say what he is like today, hmm?
I'd like to think this is self-defense on Manuel's part,
but it would be great to hear someone say that out loud.
I - is it possible to get a report from your morgue?
okay, squat down a little.
d - down a little more.
and, chief Johnson, if you'll just stand there.
um, okay.
now, um, Sergeant Gabriel, if you'll just grab me from behind.
Really?
around the neck.
not too tight.
okay, chief Johnson, walk towards me.
and bang, bang, bang, bang! He shoots Gonzales.
bang! He blasts away Gomez's elbow.
bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!
Oh, my god. What is on that sponge?
just water.
you know what? Um, I'm not sure.
here's, um, an antibacterial wipe.
you -- you'll be fine... Probably.
you know what? Take two.
so, our victims were killed while attacking someone else?
the angle of his entry wounds indicate the gun was probably fired over the shoulder
and at extremely close range.
the other guy -- just a few feet away from the weapon.
Gonzales has four kids.
what am I gonna tell his wife?
I should call her, I suppose.
now, I understand that you still need to find Manuel and get his side of the story,
but the doctor's explanation seems to fit the theory of self-defense, yes?
but if Manuel was just protecting himself,
why didn't he call the police and report what happened or alert the FBI?
but he did alert the FBI.
according to you, he told them last week what he thought might happen, and they did nothing.
and if you're from Tijuana and you know how much money these cartels have to throw around,
you think to yourself,"hey, maybe someone from the FBI is giving me up."
that's being a little paranoid, don't you think?
manuel took on the cartels.
paranoia is how you stay alive.
myself, as well.
I must keep my schedule secret.
I sleep in a different place every night -- someone's house or an apartment or a church.
I put bulletproof glass in my office. - I- I'm sorry.
did you say you sleep in churches?
well, even the cartels are a little afraid of god.
chief.
we are not going to that church. Lieutenant Provenza said not to
father Donahue's minute has turned into hours.
excuse me, uh, comandante, are you up for a little confession?
are you sure you wouldn't like to accompany me, comandante?
if Manuel really has sought sanctuary here,
seeing a Tijuana police officer may not be the best way to convince him to come out.
all right, then. Wish me luck.
chief. - Yes?
I just want to say again, for the record,
that without the permission of the archdiocese, this is a very bad idea.
churches are like foreign embassies. We don't just go storm into them
thank you so much for the warning, sergeant.
now, if y'all excuse me, I'll be back just as soon as I can.
Oh, sorry. Father Donahue?
yes?
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson of the LAPD.
the archdiocese said I could pop on by and ask a few questions. Do you mind?
Oh, uh, well... Okay. - Thank you.
who did you speak to at the archdiocese?
um, I couldn't pronounce his last name, so I just kept calling him "father."
I'm sorry. Were you eating dinner with someone?
uh, he was called away.
I was told that you were the only priest here.
I am. Have a seat.
can I get you anything?
thank you. Um, a glass of water would be nice.
do you watch a lot of Spanish television?
my congregation's mostly Latino, so these programs improve my language skills.
I see. - What can I do for you?
well, first, I just want to thank you so much for calling in the murders this morning.
you're welcome.
thank you. - Sure.
and I was just wondering
the street where you found the bodies is several blocks away from here.
and unless you make a habit of removing tarps from the backs of stolen pickups,
it seems to me you went out looking for the victims.
which is why you brought the oil for last rites.
you did perform last rites on them, didn't you?
why is that important to you?
because you interfered with my physical evidence, and it's my responsibility to find out how these men lost their lives.
and I take that very seriously.
and it's my responsibility to make sure they don't lose their souls, as well.
and I take that very seriously.
how did you know about the bodies in the first place?
I'm sorry. I can't share that information with you.
because it came to you under the seal of confession?
that's right.
was the person who shared this with you a man or a woman?
Yes.
this isn't a guessing game.
all right, then, father. Let's have a... Theological discussion.
because you found out about those bodies in confession, doesn't that mean a sin was involved?
are you familiar with how confession works?
I'd say so, yes.
and I wouldn't think that killing someone in self-defense is a sin.
the commandment reads "thou shalt not kill."
it's pretty unambiguous.
now, whether those deaths were murder or self-defense, I'm not qualified to say.
I help the penitent find forgiveness from God, not from the state.
did you help a man named Mmanuel Rivera, also known as Mateo Hernandez?
he attends church services here.
I know it because I found this on his desk.
now, you're known as a sanctuary church.
immigration has been here several times, and they
and been turned away, yes.
God doesn't recognize national borders.
I, however, am very good at recognizing my parishioners, and you're not one of them.
I'll tell the archdiocese that we spoke.
look, father, I need your help.
I'll be happy to pray for you.
manuel or Mateo or whatever name you know him by, he came to see you -- I know it.
the FBI knows it, the Tijuana police know it, and that means, sooner or later, the Ochoa drug cartel will know it.
and this is what happened to the last person who knew where Mateo was and tried to keep it a secret.
right. Okay.
what would you do with Manuel if you found him?
I would hold him on homicide charges until I checked out his story.
I celebrate mass three days a week at the county jail,
and I take confession from the border brothers
and the Sinaloan cowboys and members of every Latino street gang in Los Angeles
all of whom, in one way or another, are connected to dope, which means the Ochoa Oartel.
they're waiting for you to arrest somebody named Manuel Rivera or Mateo Hernandez.
they've been told a former Tijuana comandante of that name is gonna show up, and whoever kills him earns an instant $50, 000 for his family.
ms. Johnson, Manuel has a price on his head.
he's not gonna last an hour in the county jail.
well, I'm certain that we could find a safe place to hold him.
fortunately, that's not your problem.
is it politically incorrect to suggest that this is a Mexican standoff?
look...
if you're really serious about protecting Manuel,
I always believe actions are more powerful than words.
so, the day that a negative front-page article appears in The Times about Priority Homicide,
you seal off a Catholic church.
we're not on their property.
chief, we could have undercovers out here stopping anybody from coming out.
but they wouldn't have stopped people from going in.
pardon me.
excuse me, chief Johnson, but personally, I don't believe Manuel would ever come out of this church with it surrounded like this.
there's a bit of a negotiation going on, comandante. I'll admit that.
but we'll get through it. Pardon me.
prints on this, I hope.
let's see if they match Mateo's.
okay, and I think I know why you were bumping on the blood in the back of the pickup
because, first of all, it was several days old.
but the San Diego police spoke to the owner of that truck, and he said it just went missing this morning.
I'm thinking that's not entirely true, because the blood is AB negative -- very rare.
it doesn't type out with either of our victims.
but I spoke to the Mexican Morgue, and Manuel Rivera's nephew is AB negative.
thank you.
I really think what we have here is a gigantic misunderstanding revolving around the word "priority" and how it's applied.
come on in, chief Johnson.
Hello, Ricardo.
hope you're not angry with me, chief.
I did call your team "elite."
Ah, but, you see, that's part of the misunderstanding.
right, exactly. Exactly what I was about to say.
you think that the word "priority" means we're assigning greater value to victims
who are white and/or rich, and we were never doing that, were we, chief Johnson?
no.
and as a matter of fact, you've sort of jumped the gun on us a little bit, because we're already under way with a major departmental reorganization,
and the first thing we are dropping is Priority Homicide because of the misinterpretation
okay, let me stop you right there.
first of all, I didn't misinterpret anything.
the racial statistics speak for themselves, - and chief Johnson told me -- - I can address that.
still talking. Still talking.
which means in addition to race, you're allowing the media to determine your agenda.
n - no. No, no, no. That was never the case.
and, uh, chief Johnson was mistaken when she suggested that,
and I'm sure she'd like to tell you so.
I would.
I was, uh, irritated at the time, and I spoke without thinking.
uh, we called the division "Priority Homicide"
because we were experimenting with the concept of team investigation.
and this experiment -- which has been completely successful, by the way
was the main focus in our homicide cases.
hence, the word "priority."
and we used our best people because we felt, given that the concept was fairly new, innovative...
right. Cutting-edge, really.
it wasn't something we wanted to explore with less-experienced detectives.
and these were very tough cases, featuring suspects with greater resources,
who, as we find in the greater population...
often turn out to be white.
anyway, Priority Homicide is now a thing of the past.
as of tomorrow, actually, deputy chief Johnson will be heading a new division called "major crimes,"
which will incorporate homicide units from across the city.
major crimes.
the D. A. 's office has a department with the same designation.
well, if I can say that you sped up this reorganization in response to part 1 of my article,
this definitely changes the nature of what I'm writing in part 2.
Oh, well, you, uh, certainly deserve to take credit for this, don't you think, chief Pope?
Absolutely.
uh, in fact, if you'd like to come by tomorrow, we can, uh, show you what we're up to.
and this isn't just some cosmetic shake-up, right?
there's actually gonna be some change involved?
Oh, no, no, no, no. It's going to be huge.
major crimes puts my division in charge not only of homicide,
but also the larger fraud cases...
and, uh, kidnappings and rapes.
rape and kidnapping.
well, yes. Thoseare major crimes, aren't they?
I mean, does anyone think that rapeisn'ta major crime?
Oh, and, uh...
commander Taylor will be reporting directly to me,
coordinating my interaction with the other divisions.
of course, my elite team of detectives will stay entirely intact.
Oh, it's gonna be great! - Oh, yeah.
this is exclusively mine?
you're the first to hear it.
now, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have a murder to wrap up. Pardon me.
you see, and I-I -- stupid me.
I thought you guys were gonna be, like, all mad and stuff.
all right, well, what time should I be here tomorrow?
uh, whatever time works for you.
Yeah. Yeah, we're -- we're here.
actually, she's here. I'm gonna call you back. Chief!
you ready for this?
license and registration on the pickup truck.
chief!
the prints on the fork you gave me -- Mateo's, a. k. a. Manuel Rivera.
okay, so we know he's in the church.
no one from central moves from there until I give the word. Thank you.
lieutenant Tao, there is one last set of prints I want you to pick up for me,
and if you could match them to one of the unidentified pair we found on the not-so-stolen pickup,
I would be eternally grateful.
okay. And from where would I be lifting these prints from, exactly?
chief, I pulled up the DVD agent Howard brought in.
Plus, we have stills
everything coming over the Mexican border synced up to license plates.
so we went through them manually,
and we started an hour before the time stamp on our victims' passports.
all right, let me go over this quickly before interview the suspect.
Manuel's turning himself in?
no, no, but I've proven that he's in the church,
and I've surrounded it with police officers, so I'm pretty sure he's safe.
and here's our victims, chief.
but I thought this truck was stolen last night.
no. That's just what you told the San Diego police this morning when you realized that your plan to kill Manuel had gone terribly wrong.
let's keep this rolling for a moment. I think we're in for another surprise.
comandante, may I have your passport, please?
gentlemen, may I have your help?
this is outrageous!
you have no right to treat me this way!
I am assisting you!
and what better way to get away with murder than to investigate it yourself?
murder? You cannot charge me with murder.
but we can for illegal possession of a passport,
because you're definitely not two people, and yet you have two official IDs.
and, uh, there's a time stamp on this one.
Oh, my god.
well, what a coincidence.
there you are crossing the border right behind Gomez and Gonzales.
and, uh, what passport did you use?
did you use Martin Vasquez or Raul Llamas?
you know, the name the truck's registered under?
obviously, you spend the money the cartel pays you living your other life in San Diego.
no. No. The truck is not mine.
sir, we just matched your prints off the pictures of the victims
that you handled in my office to a previously unidentified pair that we found in the pickup.
we also found a rare type of blood in the pickup's cab, which matches that of Manuel Rivera's nephew.
now, we have some hard decisions to make.
and I need your help.
or things are gonna go very badly for you, sir.
very badly.
you have no idea how things are in Tijuana right now.
is this how you explain things to people who don't understand?
how many people do you explain it to the way you explained it to that boy?
the boy was killed in Mexico.
it's not your concern.
how do you know he was killed in Mexico?
doesn't say so on the photograph!
look.
let's be reasonable here.
you don't want to hold me on this silly passport issue.
I'd be out of your jail in hours.
but Manuel Rivera wouldn't have been out in hours, would he?
you knew that if Manuel successfully defended himself against Gomez and Gonzales
that I would be forced to leave him in the county jail while I investigated his story,
where you put a bounty on his head so one of his fellow prisoners would kill him!
manuel put a bounty on his own head when he chose to fight the cartels.
he will be a target the rest of his life.
prove I did that -- put a bounty on his head.
prove it.
you can't even prove that I sent Gomez and Gonzales to kill him in the first place.
if I could prove that, you'd be responsible for their deaths.
and we could arrest you on two counts of felony murder.
now, I'm gonna read you your rights and give you the opportunity to confess your crimes.
don't waste your time.
I have nothing to say.
we'll see about that.
Oh, no. Two passports.
I don't know which name to arrest you under. That complicates things.
it doesn't matter which name.
all right, then.
I'll send you to the county jail this way
Mateo Hernandez, a. k. a.Manuel Rivera, you are under arrest for the murder of Jacinto Jonzales and Carlos Gomez!
what? - You have the right to remain silent...
you know that's not my name!
what difference does it make? You said it didn't matter.
one will be appointed for you by the state.
have you heard and understood these rights?
you cannot arrest me as Manuel!
I can, and I have.
this is murder!
if it is, then you planned it yourself.
and you can stop it.
did you send Gomez and Gonzales across the border to kill Manuel Rivera?
did you offer $50, 000 to the person who could kill him?
No!
you -- you must arrest me as Martin Vasquez!
I'm so sorry, sir.
I'm changing your name to protect the innocent.
let her go! Let her go, you son of a bitch!
I will kill you!
you will die for this -- all of you!
you will all die for this -- all of you!
all of you! You will all die for this!
die for what, comandante?
what's there to be afraid of, comandante?
if you're really innocent, you'll be out of jail in no time.
wait! Wait!
I have -- I have access to -- I can make you all rich -- all of you!
Hey, Vasquez! - Wait!
if you see Gonzales and Gomez, tell them we all said hi.
this place is kind of beautiful.
don't start.
bless me, father, for I have sinned.
how long has it been since your last confession?
well, I almost got one last night, but the suspect, Manuel Rivera, a. k.a. Mateo Hernandez, was killed in the county jail.
you say Manuel is dead.
officially... Yes.
and it's been reported in the press.
that's why I removed the police from around your church.
you're safe now.
and so is your friend.
and what will become of the man I know as Manuel Rivera?
well, I have an FBI agent here, if Manuel wants to be supplied with a new identity.
but you're an expert in immigration.
and if there's one thing our government has successfully proven that it can't do at all, it's find illegal aliens.
I'll keep you in my prayers.
I'll take that in the spirit it was given, father.
good luck to you, sir.
through this anointing, may the lord, in his love and mercy,
help you with the grace of the holy spirit.
may the lord, who frees you from sin,
save you and raise you up.
through this anointing, may the lord,
in his love and mercy, help you with the grace of the holy spirit.
Yes, I'd like to report two men shot to death lying in the back of a pickup truck under the sixth street bridge and Anderson.
morning, chief Johnson.
so, what's all this?
two Tijuana police officers shot to death in this pickup.
jacinto Gonzales, Carlos Gomez.
is that why you called priority homicide, commander?
dead foreign police officers can only be investigated by "the elite"?
I had nothing to do with the article in The Times today
referring to phd as "elite,"
and you can tell Flynn
because I've never used the word "elite" to describe you.
okay, okay, okay.
come.
we're gonna have to respond to that article in The Times,
but everything Ramos wrote was trash.
well, chief Pope seems to be taking it seriously.
he wants me in his office an hour ago.
why is the coroner's investigator just getting here now?
lots of dead people on Monday.
and if no one's touched the bodies,
how do we know their I. D.S?
wallets, passports, badges were all laid out in plain view.
also in the driver's seat -- Guns.
this isn't the crime scene.
so, wait. Somebodydrove the bodies here?
Where's this vehicle from?
the vehicle is registered to a San Diego address.
the police down there say the owner, a Mr. Raul Llamas,
didn't even know the vehicle was stolen till they told him this morning.
so two Tijuana police officers murdered elsewhere
are driven underneath a bridge in Los Angeles
and abandoned in a stolen pickup truck.
that's so strange.
who found the bodies?
the guy who called it in didn't identify himself,
but the cellphone's registered to a father Chris Donahue.
Oh, great.
what was father Donahue doing in a place like this
at 6: 00 in the morning?
I have no idea, but there's a Catholic church four blocks away -- Our lady of the saints.
Daniels: uh, chief.
I think we got something here.
and it's seriously weird.
now we got a whole list of seriously weird stuff going.
sanchez: just another drug murder in Los Angeles.
Brenda: you recognize these bracelets, detective?
uh, it's related to the Ochoa cartel.
all their people wear them.
it means that our victims are probably dirty cops.
Investigator: both men dead about six to nine hours
and showing multiple gunshot wounds from what looks like a. 45.
okay, thank you.
gentlemen.
thank you so much.
okay, detective Sanchez,
let's let the Tijuana police know that they've lost two of their officers.
maybe they could tell us how they got here in the first place.
lieutenant Flynn, let's get a dope dog to go over this truck.
see if anything floats its boat.
after which,
lieutenant Tao, if you could take it to the print shed?
thank you.
sergeant Gabriel, I want "shots fired" reports from L. A. County for last night.
I need a crime scene in the very worst way.
chief.
look here.
olive oil.
detective Daniels,
that priest that called this in,
he didn't just find the bodies
he also performed last rites.
I'd like him in my office, please, posthaste.
pope: father Donahue doesn't have to talk to you if he doesn't want to.
and when you want to interact with the Catholic church,
you need to go through a deputy chief.
I am a deputy chief.
Yeah, I mean, you know, a real, grown-Up deputy chief with management
and administrative duties
like Dennis Murdoch, who is L. A.P. D.'s liaison with the archdiocese.
have you read The Times today
this article by Ramos?
I glanced through it, yes.
anything leap out at you?
he misspelled my middle name.
what about this?
here.
here.
deputy chief brenda Lee Johnson confesses "that 90% of the time, "Priority homicide division is deployed by her superiors
in an attempt to anticipate media coverage.
did you actuallysay this?!
of course not! He took my words out of context.
you accused me of allowing the press to run this department!
wait a minute, Will.
now, wait a minute.
the main point of this article is that phd handles
more white murder victims than robbery/homicide,
and that has nothing to do with me.
that's how you assign cases.
in addition to which, having a reporter popping in and out of my division was your idea, not mine.
you want to know what else was my idea? You!
you were my idea.
priority homicide was my idea.
and so imagine how much fun it's been explaining your comments to angry members of the police commission,
all of whom are now demanding that I dismantle your division.
do you understand what that means?
Yes. Yes, of course.
come in.
we need to -- I need to explain things better to
no, no, no. No!
I admit we need to talk to this asshole, Ramos,
because there's a big "part 1" under the headline of this article,
and we don't want part 2, which comes out next week, to end as badly.
but the time for simple explanations has come and gone.
l. A.P. D. Needs to get ahead of this story, chief Johnson.
priority homicide has established the efficacy of team investigation.
we need to apply that lesson to the rest of our force structure.
a- And translated, that means what, exactly?
priority homicide has run its course.
it's over. It's done.
I'm shutting it down.
wha-- What?
B- Because of this story?
Really?
w- What's gonna happen to my detectives?
and -- And -- And when?
when? You want to know when?
now! Today!
by the time Ramos gets here this evening,
the commander and I will have reconfigured L. A.P. D.'s various homicide units in such a way that they will withstand both criticism from the police commission as well as any further media scrutiny.
you will retain your rank and salary,
but you will no longer be in charge of anything called priority homicide.
and for now, that's it.
you're dismissed.
chief Murdoch spoke with the archdiocese.
they say father Donahue will call us when he has a minute.
okay. Um...
well, we got a minute.
um, what do we know about him -- Father Donahue?
well, he has a small church in one of the poorer sections of the city
our lady of the saints.
runs it alone, and he's been questioned several times by immigration officials.
they believe he provides sanctuary for illegals.
um, Sanchez, we hear from Tijuana?
they're sending some comandante to do their own investigation,
but our victims here, Jacinto Gonzales and Carlos Gomez,
had no official business here in Los Angeles.
but they had weapons.
uh, lieutenant Flynn, what did our dope dog think?
Oh, he was unimpressed, but there was some dried blood behind the seats in the truck's cab.
tao: S. I.D.'s still working on matching it up
and isolating fingerprints.
and, uh, we may have something here, chief
uh, an unresolved "shots fired" report.
last night at around 3: 00 a. m.
central division responds to an anonymous call
reporting a gunfight just east of the train station.
our guys drove through the area, stopped and talked to several security guards,
didn't find anything.
but all of them admit to hearing something,
except for the night watchman at Manta chemical company
uh, a Mateo Hernandez.
Yeah, I,uh, I put a want on him while you were in with Pope.
now, as it turns out,
the address on his driver's license doesn't exist.
also, Mateo's 40,
and it says he's supposedly born here in L. A.
but his social security number is only two months old.
what about vehicle registration?
he has a car. He left it at work last night.
hasn't come back for it.
but we do have two undercovers watching it right now.
so Mateo Hernandez is either a deaf illegal immigrant or...
his job site is our crime scene.
let's head over to Manta chemical and have a look-see.
good.
Oh, and, um...
excellent work, everybody...
as always.
really.
always really excellent work.
Fritz: hey. Excuse me for interrupting,
but D. O.J. says you guys made an inquiry on Mateo Hernandez.
are you saying that the FBI has a flag on Mateo?
Why? Where is he?
we can't find him just this second.
but this want is a bad thing.
I'm not authorized to tell you anything about Mateo,
except he's helped us roll up the American side of some major drug trafficking,
and he is a seriously good guy.
well, you should come with me, then.
cause I don't want to cause you any more problems at work,
but your "seriously good guy" just became my chief suspect in a double homicide.
a- And I should say that all of Mateo's paperwork was in order.
we filed it with the government.
that's all right, Mr. Gooding.
we're not from immigration.
and he was a real self-starter, too.
not just sitting around at night.
h- He -- He burglar-proofed the windows,
he -- He fixed our alarms.
he even double-bolted the loading door
a- At the end of business every day.
and this shelving...
well, when I left work last night,
this was all in rows in the center of the room.
uh, I guess Mateo must have moved it up against the walls.
Oh, and, uh, this is his desk right over here.
I didn't know him personally,
but from what I was told,
Mateo was just not the kind of guy who would cause the sort of problem you found this morning.
I disagree.
why is that?
because there's two casings right here between the shelves.
from a. 45.
for those in the know, nothing better in the handgun biz.
chief.
wasn't something like this used to tape down the tarp on the truck?
Yes.
sanchez: chief.
look what I found.
the water in this bucket has blood in it.
looks like he tried to mop the blood up off the floor.
Flynn: yeah, but why not wipe the walls down, too?
why just put shelves in front of it?
maybe he, uh, ran out of time.
the lock on this door has been taken apart from the inside.
Mr. Gooding, when did that happen?
uh, it wasn't like that when I left yesterday.
so the bodies were already here when the squad car pulled up to check on the "shots fired" report.
Mateo actually went outside and spoke to the responding officers,
tells them he doesn't hear a gunfight
while the victims are lying here on the floor?
when the police left,
Mateo was afraid that they might come back,
so he stopped cleaning up,
he pushed the shelves up against the wall,
he dragged his victims out into the stolen truck and drives them...
four blocks from his church.
all right, this business about not talking to the priest is getting ridiculous.
father Donahue has had his minute.
c- Chief!
look, just hold on a second.
we can ask father donahue to come visit us.
I mean, but walking into his church and demanding to see him?
that would raise holy hell right now.
I don't think it matters anymore what kind of hell we raise, honestly.
okay, okay, chief.
we all read the article in The Times this morning.
we understand.
it's not good.
so now is not the best time
to pick a battle with the Catholic church.
let's fight one pope at a time.
the FBI's getting ready to fax over some declassified stuff on Mateo to your murder room.
see? See?
w- We got plenty to do.
what's going on?
is Pope really giving you grief about this article?
I thought it had more to do with his problems than yours.
I can't talk about this right now -- Really.
chief, eight sets of prints inside the pickup.
two match our victims,
one goes with the prints we found on the car Mateo left at work,
and five still unknown.
thank you, lieutenant.
you want to summarize this for everybody?
sure.
all right, guys, Manuel Rivera,
A. K.A. Mateo Hernandez,
used to be a Tijuana comandante.
he refused to back off as the Ochoa cartel,
when they moved in, started buying up the local police.
great. Now the cartels are coming up here to shoot it out.
no, not Mateo.
a year ago, he abandons Mexico,
he drives up to Los Sngeles with enough evidence to dismantle
half the Ochoa cartel's American distribution system.
I think your two vics here were sent by the cartel to kill him.
okay, how did gonzales and gomez know where to find your informant
if the FBI gave Manuel this new identity -- Mateo?
well, Mateo's 18-Year-Old nephew came to visit last week.
two days after he goes back to Mexico, he's murdered.
and Mateo said the cartel went after his nephew
to find out where we had put him.
Mateo's FBI case officer talked to Mexican federales.
they said the kid was collateral damage in a random gunfight between gangs.
what was his name -- Mateo's nephew?
Ramon Camacho. Why?
well, Mexico posts all its morgue photos online,
and I use it sometimes to locate missing gang members on their database.
there he is -- Ramon Camacho.
are you kidding me?
cause of death -- Blunt-Force trauma.
he was beaten, not shot.
probably tortured for information.
and the investigating officers
jacinto Gonzales and Carlos Gomez.
Flynn: our victims.
great. That's one way to get away with murder
investigate it yourself.
so they grab the kid to find out where the uncle lives,
they beat him until he talks, and then they kill him.
and Manuel -- A. K.A. Mateo
hears about this and realizes that they're coming for him.
so Gonzales and Gomez sneak up on him somehow at work.
even have the tape out to put it over his mouth
same as they did his nephew.
Yeah, but Mateo fought back.
I mean, self-defense.
or maybe since he knew his identity had been compromised...
he knew someone was coming, so he was prepared.
he limited access to only one entrance door,
so he knew exactly where Gomez and Gonzales would enter,
almost lying in wait for them.
is there anything we can do to help?
well, that depends
am I finding mateo so the FBI can swoop down and take him away from me?
not if he committed murder, no.
lieutenant Tao,
that dried blood on -- On the back of the pickup's cab
I keep bumping on it for some reason.
would you have S. I.D.
determine if it matches up to any of our victims, please?
thank you.
chief Johnson.
Yes, commander?
deputy chief Johnson, this is comandante Martin Vasquez
from the internal-affairs division of the Tijuana police.
he's here to see about your victims.
thank you for coming, comandante.
let me fill you in on what I know so far.
uh, chief. Yes?
listen, I,uh, I know how things sounded this morning,
but trust me.
I'm -- I'm working all this out.
Yeah. I can tell.
chief, did it ever occur to you that it may not be priority homicide the police commission has a problem with?
excuse me, commander?
chief Pope is in charge of our race relations here,
and it's blowing up in his face.
so maybe instead of getting all pissed off at me, maybe you should check out how long an assistant chief usually lasts at the L. A.P. D.
I thought you'd want to help me keep our friend from an early retirement.
by giving up my division?
why am I supposed to be the fall guy here?
ha
you know what, commander?
I don't want to talk about this with you right now.
pardon me. Excuse me.
this man you're calling Mateo, I know as Manuel Rivera.
how well did you know Manuel Rivera?
we worked together.
I trusted him.
do you have any reason to believe
that the officers he shot were corrupt?
the operating rule in Tijuana right now is "trust no one."
I know the feeling.
and yet you stay.
to succeed, corruption depends on decent people
either giving in or giving up.
and I don't like giving up.
now, Manuel -- He was my friend,
but he abandoned his country, he has a new name.
after changing so much,
who can say what he is like today, hmm?
I'd like to think this is self-defense on Manuel's part,
but it would be great to hear someone say that out loud.
I- Is it possible to get a report from your morgue?
okay, squat down a little.
d- Down a little more.
and, chief Johnson, if you'll just stand there.
um, okay.
now, um, sergeant Gabriel, if you'll just grab me from behind.
Really?
around the neck.
not too tight.
okay, chief johnson, walk towards me.
and bang, bang, bang, bang!
he shoots Gonzales.
bang! He blasts away Gomez's elbow.
bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!
Ohh!
Oh, my god.
what is on that sponge?!
just water.
Oh. You know what?
um, I'm not sure.
here's, um, an antibacterial wipe.
you-- You'll be fine...
probably.
you know what? Take two.
so, our victims were killed while attacking someone else?
the angle of his entry wounds indicate the gun was probably fired over the shoulder and at extremely close range.
the other guy -- Just a few feet away from the weapon.
Gonzales has four kids.
what am I gonna tell his wife?
I should call her, I suppose.
now, I understand that you still need to find Manuel
and get his side of the story,
but the doctor's explanation seems to fit the theory of self-Defense, yes?
but if Manuel was just protecting himself,
why didn't he call the police and report what happened or alert the FBI?
but he did alert the FBI.
according to you, he told them last week what he thought might happen,
and they did nothing.
and if you're from Tijuana and you know how much money these cartels have to throw around,
you think to yourself, "Hey, maybe someone from the FBI is giving me up.
that's being a little paranoid, don't you think?
manuel took on the cartels.
paranoia is how you stay alive.
myself, as well.
I must keep my schedule secret.
I sleep in a different place every night
someone's house or an apartment or a church.
I put bulletproof glass in my office.
I- I'm sorry. Did you say you sleep in churches?
well, even the cartels are a little afraid of god.
chief.
we are not going to that church.
lieutenant Provenza said not to
father Donahue's minute has turned into hours.
excuse me, uh, comandante,
are you up for a little confession?
are you sure you wouldn't like to accompany me, comandante?
if Manuel really has sought sanctuary here,
seeing a Tijuana police officer may not be the best way to convince him to come out.
all right, then. Wish me luck.
chief. Yes?
I just want to say again, for the record,
that without the permission of the archdiocese,
this is a very bad idea.
churches are like foreign embassies.
we don't just go storm into them
thank you so much for the warning, sergeant.
now, if y'all excuse me, I'll be back just as soon as I can.
Oh, sorry.
father Donahue?
yes?
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson of the L. A.P. D.
the archdiocese said i could pop on by and ask a few questions.
do you mind?
Oh, uh, well...
okay.
thank you.
who did you speak to at the archdiocese?
um, I couldn't pronounce his last name,
so I just kept calling him "father."
I'm sorry. Were you eating dinner with someone?
uh, he was called away.
I was told that you were the only priest here.
I am.
have a seat.
can I get you anything?
thank you. Um, a glass of water would be nice.
do you watch a lot of Spanish television?
Oh.
my congregation's mostly Latino,
so these programs improve my language skills.
I see.
what can I do for you?
well, first, I just want to thank you so much
for calling in the murders this morning.
you're welcome.
thank you. Sure.
and I was just wondering
the street where you found the bodies
is several blocks away from here.
and unless you make a habit of removing tarps from the backs of stolen pickups,
it seems to me you went out lookingfor the victims.
which is why you brought the oil for last rites.
you did perform last rites on them, didn't you?
why is that important to you?
because you interfered with my physical evidence,
and it's my responsibility to find out
how these men lost their lives.
and I take that very seriously.
and it's my responsibility to make sure
they don't lose their souls, as well.
and I take that very seriously.
how did you know about the bodies in the first place?
I'm sorry. I can't share that information with you.
because it came to you under the seal of confession?
that's right.
was the person who shared this with you a man or a woman?
Yes.
this isn't a guessing game.
all right, then, father.
let's have a...theological discussion.
because you found out about those bodies in confession,
doesn't that mean a sin was involved?
are you familiar with how confession works?
I'd say so, yes.
and I wouldn't think that killing someone in self-defense is a sin.
the commandment reads "thou shalt not kill."
it's pretty unambiguous.
now, whether those deaths were murder or self-defense,
I'm not qualified to say.
I help the penitent find forgiveness from god,
not from the state.
did you help a man named Manuel Rivera,
also known as Mateo Hernandez?
he attends church services here.
I know it because I found this on his desk.
now, you're known as a sanctuary church.
immigration has been here several times, and they
and been turned away, yes.
God doesn't recognize national borders.
I, however, am very good at recognizing my parishioners,
and you're not one of them.
I'll tell the archdiocese that we spoke.
look, father, I need your help.
I'll be happy to pray for you.
manuel or Mateo or whatever name you know him by,
he came to see you -- I know it.
the FBI knows it, the Tijuana police know it,
and that means, sooner or later,
the Ochoa drug cartel will know it.
and this is what happened to the last person who knew where Mateo was and tried to keep it a secret.
right. Okay.
what would you do with Manuel if you found him?
I would hold him on homicide charges until I checked out his story.
I celebrate mass three days a week at the county jail,
and I take confession from the border brothers
and the sinaloan cowboys and members of every Latino street gang in Los Angeles
all of whom, in one way or another,
are connected to dope, which means the ochoa cartel.
they're waiting for you to arrest somebody
named Manuel Rivera or Mateo Hernandez.
they've been told a former Tijuana comandante of that name is gonna show up,
and whoever kills him earns an instant $50, 000 for his family.
ms. Johnson, Manuel has a price on his head.
he's not gonna last an hour in the county jail.
well, I'm certain that we could find a safe place to hold him.
fortunately, that's not your problem.
is it politically incorrect to suggest that
this is a Mexican standoff?
look...
if you're reallyserious about protecting Manuel,
I always believe actions are more powerful than words.
so, the day that a negative front-page article appears in The Times about priority homicide,
you seal off a Catholic church.
we're not on their property.
chief, we could have undercovers out here
stopping anybody from coming out.
but they wouldn't have stopped people from going in.
pardon me.
excuse me, chief Johnson, but personally,
I don't believe Manuel would ever come out of this church
with it surrounded like this.
there's a bit of a negotiation going on, comandante.
I'll admit that.
but we'll get through it. Pardon me.
prints on this, I hope.
let's see if they match Mateo's.
okay, and I think I know why you were bumping
on the blood in the back of the pickup
because, first of all, it was several days old.
but the San Diego police spoke to the owner of that truck,
and he said it just went missing this morning.
I'm thinking that's not entirely true,
because the blood is A. B. Negative -- Very rare.
it doesn't type out with either of our victims.
but I spoke to the Mexican morgue,
and Manuel Rivera's nephew -- A. B. Negative.
thank you.
sergeant Gabriel, I want the license, registration,
and insurance on that stolen pickup as soon as possible.
thank you.
I really think what we have here is a gigantic misunderstanding
revolving around the word "priority" and how it's applied.
come on in, chief Johnson.
Hello, Ricardo.
hope you're not angry with me, chief.
I did call your team "elite.
Ah, but, you see, that's part of the misunderstanding.
right, exactly.
exactly what I was about to say.
you think that the word "priority" means we're assigning greater value to victims who are white and/or rich,
and we were never doing that, were we, chief Johnson?
no.
and as a matter of fact,
you've sort of jumped the gun on us a little bit,
because we're already under way with a major departmental reorganization,
and the first thing we are dropping is priority homicide
because of the misinterpretation
okay, let me stop you right there.
first of all, I didn't misinterpret anything.
the racial statistics speak for themselves,
and chief Johnson told me -- I can address that.
still talking.
still talking.
and chief Johnson told me herself that you deploy her division
which includes, what, three lieutenants
in anticipation of news worthy crimes?
which means in addition to race,
you're allowing the media to determine your agenda.
N- No. No, no, no.
that was never the case.
and, uh, chief Johnson was mistaken when she suggested that,
and I'm sure she'd like to tell you so.
I would.
I was, uh, irritated at the time,
and I spoke without thinking.
uh, we called the division "priority homicide"
because we were experimenting with the concept of team investigation.
and this experiment
which has been completely successful, by the way
hence, the word "priority was the main focus in our homicide cases.
and we used our best people because we felt,
given that the concept was fairly new, innovative...
right. Cutting-Edge, really.
...it wasn't something we wanted to explore with less-experienced detectives.
and these were very tough cases,
featuring suspects with greater resources,
who, as we find in the greater population...
often turn out to be white.
anyway, priority homicide is now a thing of the past.
as of tomorrow, actually, deputy chief Johnson
will be heading a new division called "major crimes,"
which will incorporate homicide units from across the city.
major crimes. Mm-Hmm.
the D. A.'S office has a department with the same designation.
well, if I can say that you sped up this reorganization
in response to part 1 of my article,
this definitely changes the nature of what I'm writing in part 2.
Oh, well, you, uh, certainly deserve to take credit for this,
don't you think, chief Pope?
Absolutely.
uh, in fact, if you'd like to come by tomorrow,
we can, uh, show you what we're up to.
and this isn't just some cosmetic shake-up, right?
there's actually gonna be some change involved?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
it's going to be huge.
major crimes puts my division in charge not only of homicide,
but also the larger fraud cases...
and, uh, kidnappings and rapes.
rape and kidnapping.
well, yes. Those are major crimes, aren't they?
I mean, does anyone think that rape isn't a major crime?
Oh, and, uh...
commander Taylor will be reporting directly to me,
coordinating my interaction with the other divisions.
of course, my elite team of detectives will stay entirely intact.
Oh, it's gonna be great!
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.
this is exclusively mine?
you're the first to hear it.
now, if you gentlemen will excuse me,
I have a murder to wrap up.
pardon me.
you see, and I-I
stupid me. I thought you guys were gonna be, like, all mad and stuff.
all right, well, what time should I be here tomorrow?
uh, whatever time works for you.
Yeah. Yeah, we're -- We're here.
actually, she's here. I'm gonna call you back.
chief!
you ready for this?
license and registration on the pickup truck.
tao: chief!
the prints on the fork you gave me
Mateo's, A.K. A. Manuel Rivera.
okay, so we know he's in the church.
no one from central moves from there until I give the word.
thank you.
lieutenant Tao, there is one last set of prints I want you to pick up for me,
and if you could match them to one of the unidentified pair we found on the not-so-stolen pickup,
I would be eternally grateful.
okay.
and from where would I be lifting these prints from, exactly?
chief, I pulled up the DVD agent Howard brought in.
Plus, we have stills
everything coming over the Mexican border
synced up to license plates.
buzz: so we went through them manually,
and we started an hour before the time stamp on our victims' passports.
all right, let me go over this quickly
before interview the suspect.
Manuel's turning himself in?
no, no, but I've proven that he's in the church,
and I've surrounded it with police officers,
so I'm pretty sure he's safe.
buzz: and here's our victims, chief.
but I thought this truck was stolen last night.
no.
that's just what you told the San Diego police this morning
when you realized that your plan to kill Manuel had gone terribly wrong.
let's keep this rolling for a moment.
I think we're in for another surprise.
comandante, may I have your passport, please?
gentlemen, may I have your help?
this is outrageous!
you have no right to treat me this way!
I am assisting you!
and what better way to get away with murder than to investigate it yourself?
murder? You cannot charge me with murder.
but we can for illegal possession of a passport,
because you're definitely not two people,
and yet you have two official I. D.s.
and, uh, there's a time stamp on this one.
buzz: Oh, my god.
well, what a coincidence.
there you are crossing the border right behind Gomez and Gonzales.
Gabriel: And, uh, what passport did you use?
did you use Martin Vasquez or Raul Llamas?
you know, the name the truck's registered under?
obviously, you spend the money the cartel pays you
living your other life in San Diego.
no. No.
the truck is not mine.
Brenda: Sir, we just matched your prints off the pictures of the victims that you handled in my office to a previously unidentified pair that we found in the pickup.
we also found a rare type of blood in the pickup's cab,
which matches that of Manuel Rivera's nephew.
now, we have some hard decisions to make.
and I need your help.
or things are gonna go very badly for you, sir.
very badly.
you have no idea how things are in Tijuana right now.
is this how you explain things to people who don't understand?
how many people do you explain it to the way you explained it to that boy?
the boy was killed in Mexico.
it's not your concern.
how do you know he was killed in Mexico?!
doesn't say so on the photograph!
look.
let's be reasonable here.
you don't want to hold me on this silly passport issue.
I'd be out of your jail in hours.
but Manuel Rivera wouldn't have been out in hours, would he?
you knew that if Manuel successfully defended himself against Gomez and Gonzales that I would be forced
to leave him in the county jail while I investigated his story,
where you put a bounty on his head
so one of his fellow prisoners would kill him!
manuel put a bounty on his own head
when he chose to fight the cartels.
he will be a target the rest of his life.
prove I did that
put a bounty on his head.
prove it.
you can't even prove that I sent Gomez and Gonzales
to kill him in the first place.
if I could prove that, you'd be responsible for their deaths.
and we could arrest you on two counts of felony murder.
now, I'm gonna read you your rights
and give you the opportunity to confess your crimes.
don't waste your time.
I have nothing to say.
we'll see about that.
Oh, no.
two passports.
I don't know which name to arrest you under.
that complicates things.
it doesn't matter which name.
all right, then.
I'll send you to the county jail this way
Mateo Hernandez, A.K. A. Manuel Rivera,
you are under arrest for the murder of Jacinto Gonzales and Carlos Gomez!
What?!
sanchez: You have the right to remain silent...
you know that's not my name!
what difference does it make?
you said it didn't matter.
...one will be appointed for you by the state.
have you heard and understood these rights?
you cannot arrest me as Manuel!
I can, and I have.
this is murder!
if it is, then you planned it yourself.
and you can stop it.
did you send Gomez and Gonzales across the border to kill Manuel Rivera?
did you offer $50, 000 to the person who could kill him?!
no!!
you -- You must arrest me as Martin Vasquez!
I'm so sorry, sir.
I'm changing your name to protect the innocent.
let her go!
let her go, you son of a bitch!
I will kill you!
you will die for this
all of you!
you will all die for this
all of you!
all of you!
you will all die for this!
die for what, comandante? Hmm?
what's there to be afraid of, comandante? Huh?
if you're really innocent, you'll be out of jail in no time.
wait! Wait!
I have
I have access to
I can make you all rich
all of you!
Hey, Vasquez!
wait! Aah!
if you see Gonzales and Gomez,
tell them we all said hi.
Hey.
this place is kind of beautiful.
don't start.
bless me, father, for I have sinned.
how long has it been since your last confession?
well, I almost got one last night,
but the suspect, Manuel Rivera,
A. K.A. Mateo Hernandez,
was killed in the county jail.
you say Manuel is dead.
officially...
Yes.
and it's been reported in the press.
that's why I removed the police from around your church.
you're safe now.
and so is your friend.
and what will become of the man I know as Manuel Rivera?
well, I have an FBI agent here,
if Manuel wants to be supplied with a new identity.
but you're an expert in immigration.
and if there's one thing our government has successfully proven that it can't do at all,
it's find illegal aliens.
I'll keep you in my prayers.
I'll take that in the spirit it was given, father.
good luck to you, sir.
I will need it.
I need you to send units to 1st and Indiana.
my brother's been shot.
we will find who did this.
this is Ricardo Ramos from The Times.
he's gonna be trailing Priority Homicide's investigation.
nice to meet you, chief Johnson.
I take orders from assistant chief Will Pope.
and 9 times out of 10, decisions he makes anticipate what's going to be splashed across the front page of your paper.
have you read The Times Today?
90% of the time, Priority Homicide Division is deployed to anticipate media coverage.
did you actually say this?
phd handles more white murder victims than Robbery Homicide, and that has nothing to do with me.
that's how you assign cases.
priority Homicide has run its course. It's over. I'm shutting it down.
deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, Priority Homicide
um, Major Crimes Division. Shoot. Can we start over?
I can't. I'm not allowed to edit any of this, and once it's started just cut it, then. Just stop the tape.
I can't. Once I start recording, I can't stop.
all right, then, just get the bod please.
uh, no, no, no. Let's start over here. Thank you.
watch out for the glass.
and you need to stay there for a second. - Okay.
okay, lieutenant Tao, what happened here?
well, I can't look underneath him.
but judging from the damage to the mirror and the size of the spatter
and the way the blood has collected on the bed linen, I'm thinking, perhaps, a shotgun blast to the belly.
must have been in a lot of pain before he died.
look at the way he was grabbing at the sheets.
why are we always waiting for the coroner's investigator these days?
all right, since I can't touch the body, maybe someone could tell me about this gentleman?
like, his name, for example?
Yeah, the neighbor who called in the shots-fired knew him as Darren.
last name on the mailbox is Melman.
well, my vast experience as a detective tells me that his name is Darren Melman.
I found these unpaid bills with Melman's name on it.
that doesn't mean he's our victim.
a neighbor said that Melman was some kind of building contractor.
isn't he a little young to be a contractor?
only have to be 18 in this state.
all right, Sergeant Gabriel, I'd like a photograph.
please run his name through the DMV.
also check through the state contractors licensing board.
and let's find out if he has a police record of any kind. Also next of kin. I'm on it, chief. - Thank you.
did Mr. Melman have a roommate?
not according to his landlord.
and what about a girlfriend?
well, would you go out with anybody who kept a place like this?
I mean, I would say it was a robbery, but how would you know what was missing?
well, no one stole the computer.
we'll take that with us. And dump the phones.
I'm assuming that his cellphone's still on his body, lieutenant Tao?
maybe. Chief, there's velcro on his sleeve. Odd.
what is keeping that slowpoke coroner's investigator?
uh, my son's sick. Waiting for my mom to sit with him.
hate to leave you hanging.
I'm so sorry.
poor thing.
chief, this was taped to the wall.
and the victim's got a whole notebook with the same drawing.
double "E." Is that some kind of gang symbol?
no.
well, maybe it's a business logo.
or an old girlfriend's initials.
chief.
chief.
not much in the way of personal belongings, but we do have some roofing nails and some plumbing pipe.
that makes sense if he's a contractor.
also three kinds of ammunition, including rifle bullets.
what would he be hunting in the Hollywood hills?
not much without rifles, but maybe someone stole his guns.
sir, um, I really need you to get the wallet and the cellphone off the victim, please.
chief, I think I see his cellphone
whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait!
what? - Okay.
the nonconcentric abrasions concern me. But...
look at this. - What?
this is not a bullet fragment.
see this oblong piece here?
this is shrapnel.
that says "bomb" -- everybody out!
no, no, no, hang on!
sergeant Gabriel, call the bomb squad.
no, delay that order.
I want the computer, and I need the cellphone and the wallet.
then we call the bomb squad.
no way, chief. Everybody out now.
Gabriel, you grab her! - No!
sorry, chief! - No!
detective, I am issuing a direct order!
detective! Detective! And my purse!
put me down this instant! I mean it!
you had better put me down!
my purse! My purse!
this is ridiculous.
I'm conducting a murder investigation.
y'all had no right to haul me out like a sack of potatoes!
chief, you get upset with us when we break the rules,
you get upset with us when we follow the rules.
if you want to beef us for pulling you out of a bomb scene, be my guest.
commander, I want good news.
we've evacuated the building,
and we're clearing the block so the bomb squad can set up their forward post.
okay, how soon do I get my crime scene back?
Tao?
12 hours, give or take.
you're joking.
that's standard protocol, chief.
but the bomb already went off. It killed our victim.
there may be more bombs up in that building.
anyways, it's not really up to us,
so I recommend that we let them do their jobs as safely as they can, all right?
bomb squad already notified FBI and homeland security.
this goes from bad to worse.
I need to see that body.
it is vitally important that I get that computer and that cellphone as soon as possible.
good morning, lieutenant. How can I help you?
here she comes. - Here who comes?
patron saint of all bomb techs. She's named after her.
state-of-the-art in UGVs -- unmanned ground vehicles.
ain't she cool?
does she have a second gear, or is she the slowest robot on earth?
when you're handling bombs, it's not good to rush Babs.
Hey, Provenza, that robot looks like you running.
Oh, you're so full of it, Flynn.
you know that I don't run.
Babs is almost at the front door.
Oh, for heaven's sakes!
Hey, chief, I have the victim's rap sheet.
Darren Melman, age 19, one juvenile arrest two years ago.
great, great. Where and when, please?
Oh, it doesn't say -- I'll have to pull the report when we get back to Parker Center.
okay, people, Babs has entered the building.
I'm climbing the stairs.
okay, Babs, watch those stairs.
I know how you are.
okay, here we go.
we want to move left into the apartment.
turning. Turning. Turning.
right. Good. Yeah, left.
very good. Okay, now pan right.
panning.
Yeah, there you go. Oh, no!
Oh, my...
what the hell is she doing in there?
y'all can stop worrying now.
I have the wallet. Now I just need to get the cellphone.
and don't hurry on my account, Babs.
pipe bomb.
help... Me.
get her out of there -- now, now!
get chief Johnson out of there now!
remove the chief now!
she could totally blow up.
I could walk this, you know.
do you have any idea how many
how many rules you broke?
I had to get my purse.
and look -- I got the wallet.
that'll give us something to do while we wait for the computer and cellphone.
you know, it's just -- it's just I
I would really hate to see you get blown up by a pipe bomb just as I
I've gotten used to you.
well, I so appreciate the sentiment. Oh, good -- driver's license.
Darren Melman. That looks like our victim, so we're on the right guy.
detective Daniels, here is a receipt from home supply central for $358.
it's organized by UPC , so I can find out exactly what he bought.
wonderful.
what's that? You're kidding me.
fire in the hole! Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole!
lieutenant, what just happened?
the explosives on Melman were unstable, so they had to be biped.
wha-- ?
BIP-- blown in place.
so, where's my victim?
my guess is he's probably all over the ceiling.
you blew him up?
what about the computer?
what about the cellphone?
what about Babs?
three boxes of 8-inch galvanized metal pipe, 10 to a box.
check.
one drill.
five boxes of light-anywhere matches.
two 50-pound boxes of roofing nails.
check. Check. Check.
this is stuff you'd need if you're a building contractor.
but add some gunpowder, you got yourself a bomb factory.
wait -- there's one more item from the home supply central receipt, and here it comes.
four propane tanks.
detective, no guns?
this is everything you pulled from the receipt from his wallet,
but it doesn't cover the ammunition we found at his home.
and we still don't know if he has guns to go with it.
I didn't see any propane tanks in Darren Melman's apartment.
bet he has a storage unit.
or he already placed them somewhere and set them to go off.
so, did Melman blow himself up or was he murdered?
I don't know.
he could have been killed by a co-conspirator,
which is why I wanted that computer so badly and his cellphone.
chief, Melman's contractor's license was up-to-date
no liens, no lawsuits, no complaints.
but sergeant Gabriel pulled the juvie arrest record for our human roman candle.
good.
go ahead, sergeant. Tell her.
I, uh, pulled the file on the vandalism bust.
and apparently, Mr. Melman broke into his high school, where he, uh...
defecated on the principal's desk.
which means he's been dropping bombs his whole life.
I said "ew," lieutenant. "ew. ew."
uh, Darren's parents are in the middle of a three-week cruise on the Mediterranean.
we're trying to contact them now.
all right, well, maybe they can tell us who his friends are and explain what this symbol means.
about that double "E," I've literally checked every symbol and alphabet database I know
satanic, Gothic, pre-Colombian, Celtic, Aryan, a list of initials related to famous criminals,
eastern European serial killers, the L. A. Graffiti index, popular tattoos, Asian calligraphy cults.
you name it, no matches.
I think it's probably something personal.
chief, a DVD of the store's security cam. - Thank you.
y'all won't believe this.
he left almost a pound.
Oh, for heaven's sake!
the time and date stamp on the home supply central receipt shows Melman checked out with all the stuff at 10: 38 a. m.
we pulled the footage from a half-hour before and after.
there he is. There's Melman.
buzz, can you read the license plate on that truck?
I can blow it up for you.
and he brought a friend.
well, congratulations, everyone. We have a conspiracy.
the truck is registered to Melman.
Yeah, but who's the other little freak?
hang on, hang on. What's this?
maybe one of them can tell us.
okay, Buzz, can you freeze that and...
make it larger?
I sure can. - Thank you.
that's Darren Melman.
he comes by home supply central a lot.
I think he's a roofer or something.
y'all are good friends.
not really.
well, how do you know him?
we went to high school together.
oak Valley West.
Frank. - What?
what about you?
he's Frank. I'm Keith.
I got out of Oak Valley a year before Melman.
I knew him, but he wasn't, like, in my fave five.
I don't think Melman even graduated, did he?
we heard about what he did in the principal's office.
Oh, yeah?
I thought that was just a rumor.
well, the principal was kind of of a turd.
boys, Darren Melman blew himself up this morning with supplies he bought at your store.
blew up?
that's right.
you mean like -- like,"exploded" blew up?
his insides ripped apart by a homemade pipe bomb packed with gunpowder and nails.
how about the other guy in the video, helping put stuff in the truck?
you guys know his name?
y'all seem pretty chummy here in the security video.
his name's Joe.
no, John... something. John.
right. He was younger.
probably a senior at Oak Valley by now.
and this John and Darren Melman, were they good friends?
we didn't really know him that well.
did John blow himself up, too?
not if I can help it.
two boys go out and buy and build a small arsenal.
one of them blows himself up.
the other, a John somebody from the videotape,
is still very much at large and might be about to use all the weapons we can't account for.
and, sir, both of these boys went to the same high school.
which we now have very good reason to evacuate. Commander.
I'll alert L. A. unified police.
call it an earthquake drill.
if the school is the target, I don't want this kid to know we're on to him.
let's make sure L. A. F. D. has two engine companies standing by,
and I want every officer with a picture of this John what's-his-name.
nobody gets off the grounds until we check every face.
go over every inch of that school.
I've been principal here for going on 20 years, and I always know the bad kids.
Darren Melman was a troublemaker.
but John Mcfadden, the boy you're after, he's -- he's never been a problem.
turning.
is that gonna blow something up?
Babs is a she.
and no, sir. No, I think she'll use a water cannon to open up that locker.
when you're dealing with homemade pipe bombs, you can't be too cautious.
and Johnny's parents are good people, too -- very involved.
preparing to fire.
fire in the hole! Fire in the hole!
sir, let's go over here, please, just to be safe.
you might want to cover your ears.
fire.
good job, Babs.
sir, Darren Melman had this drawn all over his apartment and tattooed on his body.
it must have meant something to him and clearly to John Mcfadden, as well.
do you have any idea what it might mean?
no, I'm sorry. I really wish I knew.
excuse me.
chief, John Mcfadden is nowhere on campus, and according to his teacher,
he went home sick after first period.
thank you so much.
thank you. - Thank you.
we're gonna end up evacuating this whole city.
so, all the neighbors are being told there's a gas leak.
so far, everyone's going quietly.
no sirens, no broadcasting, no commotion. Was that made clear?
Yes, ma'am. - Okey.
uh, sergeant, take off your sunglasses.
just try and look less like a cop.
Mrs. Mcfadden? - Yes.
I'm Miss Johnson from Oak Walley West high school, and this is Mr. Gabriel.
you can call me David... or Mr. G.
actually, that's what the kids call me -- it's hipper.
Oh, Johnny never mentioned you. What class do you teach?
chemistry.
and we know that John's got an awfully big test tomorrow,
and we just want to make sure that he has all the material.
that is so nice of you. Please come in.
thank you.
I should have called the school.
Johnny came home early with an upset stomach.
I'll just go check and make sure he's up.
lovely home you have, Mrs. Mcfadden. - Well, thank you.
Johnny? - yeah.
got some people here to see you.
Johnny? Wait, what are you people doing?
Johnny, are you okay? Please, stop it!
who are you people? Johnny?
Oh, my god! Could you -- what are you doing? Stop it!
show me your hands! - Yeah.
show me your hands! Don't move!
hands behind your back! - Yeah, you got me.
what's happening? Johnny? - Get 'em up! Down!
who are you people? What is going on?
ma'am, calm down. We're the LAPD. Calm down.
chief. - Oh, my god.
Johnny, are you okay?
tell me what is going on here.
ma'am, we're taking your son downtown.
you can come with us if you like. This way, please.
is the neighborhood totally evacuated?
everyone within a 10-block radius.
do you want to call in the bomb squad?
have we found any bombs yet?
no. - All right, then.
Hey, chief, looks like Melman and Johnny boy were planning armageddon.
got bulletproof vests.
we got guns. - Got big guns.
got ammo. - And propane tanks.
so much for involved parents.
chief, there must be over a dozen pipe bombs in here.
okay, now these are bombs! Everybody out! Everybody out! Everybody out! Quickly! Come on!
and somebody call Babs!
okay. Still haven't found anything at the school.
and John Mcfadden's old man is on his way over here from work demanding an attorney for his boy.
his boy is 18 years old and can ask for an attorney for himself.
and if dad gives you any trouble, you can arrest him for storing bombs and illegal weapons in his garage.
Yeah, well, Mrs. Mcfadden said they had "no idea" little Johnny was doing that back there.
Yeah, I'll tack on a charge of felony stupidity.
lieutenant, have you reminded Mr. Mcfadden of his rights?
sure have.
Mr. Mcfadden...
you mind if I call you "John"?
I've been called worse.
Oh, yeah? What have people been calling you?
you went home sick from school today.
glad to see you got your appetite back.
this kid is blissed out. Did anybody check him for drugs?
well, you know how it goes in booking.
every suspect we bring in, we say,"are you on anything"?
every suspect says,"no."
sure we can't get you anything else to eat?
you're a chocolate person. So am I.
we should, like, get married or something.
well, we have to get to know each other a little bit first.
for example, you had a pretty serious arsenal at your house.
I have pipe bombs, propane tanks, bullets, fuses, nails, automatic weapons.
where did you learn about all this?
not in school.
I take it you don't like school?
Oh, no, I love it. My favorite.
if you don't want to tell me what you were up to, maybe your parents will...
when we arrest them.
I mean, it was their garage, after all.
my parents aren't smart enough to understand what I'm doing.
what about your friend Darren Melman?
I don't know who that is.
we have video of both of you buying your bomb-making materials at home supply central.
like you, he had this tattooed on his arm.
or at least he did until this morning when he exploded all over his apartment.
Melman was supposed to die anyway.
Why's that?
we could wait here all day.
no, we can't.
you're running out of time.
I don't think I understand. Who's running out of time?
it's natural selection.
read your darwin.
educate me.
what does it say?
are you guys recording this?
Yes, we are.
okay, check it out.
the human race is an infestation on this planet
6. 68 billion termites chewing up and spitting out resources, choking on their own vomit.
you know what the logical end of this behavior is?
extinction.
and what's your role in all this?
mine?
I am an agent of extinction.
I am evolution's end.
the double "E."
is that what this symbol means?
evolution's end?
you will learn about evolution's end as you line up to die.
I'm not afraid of death.
I used to be, but not anymore.
see, I didn't create -- I didn't create this bullshit world.
I just want to do as much damage as I can before I go.
these are pretty big evolutionary ideas, John.
radical, but not without merit.
and people need to hear about them.
but I don't think most everyone will understand what all this means unless you explain it to them.
what don't you -- what don't you understand?
well, for example, how you're planning on setting off the propane tanks.
it's easy -- you just aim them and shoot.
boom!
so that's evolution's end -- you and Darren Melman killing some kids at school?
no, no, no, no, no, you keep on reducing this to some minuscule high-school shooting, but it's so much more than that.
I'm talking about setting the record -- killing the most people ever.
it's about inspiring others.
columbine was a great idea, but they just didn't execute it right.
we will.
and people will remember us...
as they line up to die.
no one is going to die, John.
Darren Melman is dead, and you're in custody.
your plan is over -- extinct.
now, the bad news is is that you were caught with a lot of bombs and guns, but the goods news is that you haven't killed anyone yet.
so all you have to do is tell us what you and Darren Melman were planning, and I'll get you some help.
I already told you.
and now you're running out of time.
time to do what?
have you planted a bomb?
what were we talking about?
is there a bomb somewhere on a timer?
no, it's natural selection. Read your darwin.
okay, John, you already said that.
I want you to listen to me. I want you to focus!
where are the bombs?
you're running out of time.
are you on drugs?
look at me!
John! Don't go anywhere, John!
stay with me, John! John! John!
Mrs. Mcfadden, is your son taking any prescription drugs?
uh, yes. He's -- he's clinically depressed. Why?
okay, what drugs is he on?
is he okay? - What is he taking?
some sort of M. A. O. Inhibitor.
I can't remember the name. Is Johnny all right?
chief, something's happening here. - What's
John! Come on, John!
he had a seizure and just dropped.
come on, stay with us, John! Stay with me! Wake up! Come on, John!
I have the defibrillator. Here we go.
come on, buddy, stay with us.
stay with us, Johnny. Come on, buddy.
okay. - Clear.
check his pulse, check his pulse.
nothing. - Nothing.
clear.
stay with us, Johnny! Clear!
well, it didn't take long.
the Mcfaddens' attorney is accusing us of killing their son while in custody.
I'm moving the autopsy to the top of the line.
and the coroner will only tell them what we already know
that their son overdosed on an M. A. O. Inhibitor that turns lethal when mixed with chocolate.
he blew himself up, just like his friend.
the drug was the explosive.
the chocolate was the detonator.
but did he leave another bomb somewhere with another detonator?
do we have all the guns?
where did they come from?
okay, it's a total -- a total long shot, but there is a sporting-goods store at the shopping mall where the kids bought the bomb-making materials.
we could check their receipts -- I don't know
see if the kids have a record of purchasing weapons there.
haven't found a thing at the school, and we've torn that apart.
Oh, great. Thank you so much. My clothes.
okay, but John mentioned Columbine for a reason.
it must have been part of their plan.
the Columbine plan didn't work.
Really? How so?
the shooters planted propane tanks inside the school.
the plan was to blow up the tanks and force the survivors outside where they could be picked off by rifle fire.
when the tanks didn't explode, the shooters went inside the school.
all I'm saying is, as horrible as it was, the original plan didn't work.
if it had, it could have been even worse.
morning, everyone. Congratulations.
what for?
for... preventing what could have been a horrible massacre at a public high school.
I'm headed there now for a press conference.
wait, wait, wait.
I think it's much too early to say for certain that the threat is over.
Why?
because we...
found more propane tanks than we have receipts for, and we don't know how many guns these boys had to begin with, and...
you're running out of time.
that's what John Mcfadden kept saying before he died
"you're running out of time" -- and I never found out what he meant.
well, sure you did.
he'd taken a lethal dose of his medication.
he was minutes from lapsing into cardiac arrest, and he knew it.
but what if that's not what he meant?
okay, so, to be clear, you're basing your misgivings about the success of this investigation on the fact that you have too much evidence and on the testimony of a clinically depressed kid in a drug-induced delirium.
sir, I, uh -- I think what chief Johnson is saying is that she'd like more time to tie up some loose ends before we go to press.
and all I'm asking is, "what loose ends"?
like how and where they purchased their guns and where they got their ammunition
okay. I'm not saying stop investigating.
start your after-action report right now.
and... listen... I-I know.
it's been a rough couple of days.
two young men died.
one of them died right here in this building.
but whatever these boys were planning, you stopped them...
which is why I need to do this press conference.
we've all taken a few on the chin from the media around here recently.
and for once, I get to talk about something we did right.
our new Major Crimes Division is working, thank god.
at the end of the day, this is a big win for us.
so, congratulations.
Flynn, check this out.
you could fit a whole person in this thing.
Yeah, remind me not to come to your house for a barbecue.
Yeah, like I'd invite you.
like you could cook.
so, could you use the computer to pull up any receipts for Darren Melman going back about three months?
Yeah. I could do that.
you could. That's great. Thanks, Keith.
and if I gave you credit-card numbers for John Mcfadden and his parents, would you pull up receipts for them during the same time period?
just let me get the key from my manager.
that's great.
just got to get the key.
are you bored?
actually, I'm thinking about wallpaper.
Ugh, things are bad enough without shopping.
you guys sure the propane tanks you found were from our store?
uh, you know, we're not, actually.
we're just trying to account for everything.
would you know if any tanks were stolen from here?
I could tell you pretty fast if they were.
our system keeps track of every item in stock.
do you want me to go check?
Oh, could you?
I'd really appreciate that.
no prob.
and, Frank, I believe that there's a sporting-goods store in the mall that sells guns.
can you tell me where that might be?
Yeah. Go into the mall, then up the broken escalator.
stay right. You can't miss it.
thank you. Stay right.
stay to the right.
this is why I hate shopping malls.
look, here's the directory.
okay.
you are here." That much we know."
and the sporting-goods store is...
over there. - Okay.
I also think there's a place here to get wallpaper.
so if you don't mind, I'm gonna
Oh, my.
what?
the school's not the target.
we're in the target.
chief, S. W.A. T. team is setting up fast as they can.
we should hear helicopters in less than 10 minutes.
we may not have 10 minutes, lieutenant. Move the rollout along, please.
chief, Keith says that the propane tanks are kept in a locked cage behind the store and that Frank is the only one with the key.
he didn't tell me that.
let me see your arms now!
have you ever seen this?
Yeah, man, Frank's got that tattooed on his arm.
wait a minute, wait a minute. Look at this.
Melman, Mcfadden, and this other kid, Frank, right?
three kids, three stars.
maybe these points show us where each kid was gonna position himself.
and the propane tanks were arranged so that when they were shot and exploded, it would push the people out the exits.
and if Frank is still here and sticking to the plan at all, maybe we find him at one of these three points, no?
high ground or... the roof.
but if the propane tanks aren't exploding, how is he gonna get people to run out of here?
do we evacuate?
no, no, no, no, no.
let's all spread out and start looking for frank.
Yes, hello?
why did you pull the bomb squad from the school?
and you've asked for all available units and air support?
the school is not the target. It's the mall.
and there's a third boy involved.
are you sure?
he could start shooting at any time, and I don't know where he is or if we found everything they were planning to detonate.
chief. Chief.
what's happening? Brenda?
I can't talk now. Just send help.
how do you get to the roof?
there and there.
okay, lieutenant Provenza, detective Sanchez, you go that way.
I'm coming with you. - Fine.
lieutenant Flynn, sergeant Gabriel, come with us.
we'll split up on the roof and surround him.
it's starting. Lieutenant Tao, detective Daniels, keep people inside!
stay away from the door! Sir, step in!
this is only a drill!
l. A. P. D! I need you to step back!
I need you to go back in the mall! Please!
sir, get back in!
get her out of here!
son of a bitch!
are you okay, sir? - Fine, fine.
check your guns.
check your extra mags.
you ready? - Yeah.
good luck. - Good luck.
good luck.
good luck. - Good luck.
bastard!
be careful.
keep firing on him! He's not going down!
you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm okay. - I'm okay.
you okay? - Good.
head shots! Head shots!
I only got one mag.
shoot slow.
shoot the bag! Shoot the bag!
he took three hits.
probably a collapsed lung.
now you get him to the nearest Trauma Center.
losing blood fast! Get him in! Get him in now! Get him in.
you'll be okay, Julio. - Let's go!
I'm going with him. - Sir!
take it easy, Julio. Take it easy.
sir. - What is it, son?
you ran. - What?
you ran! You never run!
go! Go! Go!
let's go!
detective Sanchez, listen to me!
I'm issuing you a direct order.
keep breathing! Do you hear me?
keep breathing!
Oh, ma, please don't cry.
I can't help it, Brenda Leigh.
who designed this veil - the Taliban?
let's try another one.
almost done.
all right. There.
I have never seen anyone so beautiful in my whole life.
I have, Willie Ray.
when you walked down the aisle wearing that dress.
now I need a tissue.
I'm just sorry you have to wait a month to see Brenda in that beautiful dress.
well, technically, it's only 28 days.
but I bet we'd both feel better if we had that in writing.
think of yourself half a century hence,
when you and Brenda could be doing what Willie Ray and I are doing right now, getting ready to celebrate your 50th anniversary on a cruise of the hawaiian islands.
I can almost smell the sea breeze.
Yeah, but why should I be wearing white, ma? It's not like i'm a
Brenda Leigh, white is the color of joy and new beginnings.
well, I should just - you'd have to do work on this, mama.
I should just wear the gown from my first wedding.
Oh, no, no. You can't re-wear that dress. That's cursed!
besides, your father and I like to pretend that first marriage never happened.
now stand up, and turn around.
so, which is it gonna be -- your sister-in-law amy's...
your aunt Ruth's... Or mine?
well, I like yours the best.
well, of course she does.
that's the only right answer with me standing next to her.
still, I'm glad she said it anyway.
No! No!
I'm not looking. It's lieutenant Flynn.
thank you.
yes? Hello? Yes.
I hope we find a proper place for y'all to get married before we have to get on that ship.
Brenda Leigh always lets things slide until the very last minute.
I wish she'd take more of an interest in all this.
Oh, she's very interested, Willie Ray.
for example, look at how hard she's been searching for the right cake.
if that girl had her way, she'd ask a minister to stop by a crime scene and then serve ho hos out of her purse.
I hope she's not headed for one of those horrible murders.
we have so many places we have to see.
no, ma, I'm stopping by the office for a quick celebration,
which I said might be happening today, and to sign off on a suicide that just came in.
and then I will be joing you for our tour of very small chapels.
tiny, tiny. I mean it.
and I'm sorry I can't come with you today, but I promise,
I'm gonna hook up with all of you right after work.
okay.
I thought we were gonna pick out a cake before we left this morning.
I have a long day.
no, positive. Thanks.
Oh, my god. Open your card.
but why light duty?
I've spent a great deal of time with him, and detective Sanchez seems fully recovered to me.
the guy's had five surgeries and a shoulder reconstructed from cadaver parts.
all it takes is one doctor to say,"he's not ready yet."
I took him to the firing range three days ago, and he still ranks a sharpshooter,
and I saw him run half a mile at the track.
look, lieutenant Provenza is his immediate supervisor.
he should have all the paperwork, ask him what's up.
meanwhile, two patrol officers from the Hollywood division wrote up a suicide last Sunday.
morales calls back from the morgue and says the guy was murdered.
Hollywood homicide detectives didn't follow up?
did you not hear the words "suicide" and "Sunday?"
Oh, lovely.
so, the good doctor is offering the case to major crimes before filing a complaint with the D. A.
which could trigger an inquiry, which chief pope does not need right now.
so, Dr. Morales, I understand you have something to show us.
I do.
all right, then, would someone kill the lights, please?
Yeah. I got it, chief.
you guys, maybe you want to put down your little wedding-cake samples while I show you my presentation.
it's pretty graphic.
no, we're fine, doc.
in fact, this is a really good test to see which one of these the chief might choose for her reception.
Yeah, if you still like it while you're watching somebody who blew their brains out,
this is the cake for your wedding.
but this guy didn't blow his brains out. That was done for him.
this is a murder. Jeffrey Crawford
white male, 36 years old, building contractor.
who discovered the body?
that would be his minister.
pastor Paul Hicks.
according to the responding officers,
the minister identified himself as a close friend of the victim, Jeff Crawford.
is there any reason to believe Mr. Crawford would want to off himself?
hesitation marks on his wrists.
from an old suicide attempt.
I'm not investigating his past.
uh, Mr. Crawford also owed a substantial sum to his brother, with whom he owned a contracting business.
and his ex-wife is suing him for back alimony and child support.
Plus, he just got out of rehab for cocaine addiction six months ago.
other than that, life was good.
I don't care what his personal life was like.
I'm interested in the physical evidence.
we do an x-ray series of every victim that comes to the coroner's office.
as you can see, the first and second joints of his index and middle fingers on his right hand are fused from an old injury.
they - they don't bend.
and he was shot through the right side of his head.
which means that he would have had to use his ring finger to pull the trigger.
considering how awkwardly the gun would have to be held to go from right to left, back to front.
even if it could be done, I don't believe it, and I'm not signing off on suicide.
so, I'm going over Hollywood division's head.
if the L. A.P. D. won't follow up - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second, doc.
I don't think I like your tone, okay?
Really? - Yeah, really.
how about a dial tone?
cause that's what you're gonna get the next time you call for an expedited autopsy.
now might be a really great time for everyone here to remind themselves
I don't work for you.
I work for the county, and I have a legal obligation to determine how this man died.
now, if you won't take this seriously, I have no trouble going elsewhere.
enjoy your cake.
doctor, please. Please. One moment, please.
I - I'm terribly, terribly sorry.
lieutenant Provenza, could you call the victim's brother, please?
we should try and meet with him as soon as possible.
and, commander Taylor, since there's a minister involved,
would you go through the necessary channels for me to speak with him, please?
and, detective Sanchez, let's go through everything that the s. I.D collected from the crime scene.
chief, I've been looking at the pictures they took, and the doctor might be right.
this is the bathroom where the body was found.
look at the blowback. It's not uniform.
there's a bloody silhouette on the door, maybe where the shooter was standing.
I'll get to the bottom of this. I promise.
just... Take this seriously. Please.
Absolutely.
welcome back, detective.
you want my opinion, chief?
Yes, lieutenant.
I was surprised, but I liked the lemon cream. It held up.
thank you, lieutenant.
I'll make sure and tell my mom.
call you that Sunday morning and tell you that he was feeling down and depressed?
and did he give you any indication that...
well, captain Joiner called me from Hollywood division and tells me we're about to incur a lawsuit.
is - is that right?
a lawsuit? Over what?
well, did we tell the family and friends of some drug addict that
he killed himself and then start investigating it as a murder?
I'm sorry, sir, but the morgue decided that the death was undetermined,
so rather than put Dr. Morales on a collision course with the entire
okay, listen, first, we don't investigate suicides.
that's - that's number one. Second
second, it's not a suicide. It's undetermined.
so what would you like me to do?
Yes, detective Daniels?
uh, it turns out Ed here wasn't just our victim's brother and business partner.
he's also sole heir to Jeff Crawford's will.
and Jeff had a really expensive insurance policy just vested recently.
$2 million payoff, and the only beneficiary his brother.
I thought Jeff had kids.
and now they have a rich uncle.
one more thing
the weapon found at the scene that Jeff used to blow his brains out belongs to Ed here.
are we now turning all these mourners into suspects?
I promise that I will investigate this murder discreetly.
Oh, my god. You just called it a murder. That isnotdiscreet.
sir, I-I want to address your concerns. I just -- I just -- I have to do one thing first, okay?
thank you.
Jeff joined this church after he got out of rehab.
he told me he had given his life to Christ.
and he became close with his minister.
and he started dating - almost got engaged, I guess, to this sweet girl Beth on chemo for lymphoma.
maybe it was her saying no to being married that - that pushed him over the edge - I don't know.
I - I don't know.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
please don't be mad at me, sirs.
y'all want to keep going, or - or should I...
what is it now?
well, I forgot to have Mr. Crawford here sign the miranda waiver.
I'm - I'm so sorry.
uh, well, j - just hurry it up, huh? Let's go. Come on.
if you could just initial the marked areas explaining that you don't have to talk to us and that you, uh, you know
you have the right to an attorney. The usual rigmarole.
Oh, okay.
so, you paid your brother even though he didn't come into work?
I would have bought Jeff out, but by the time I discovered how much money he had borrowed from the company to buy drugs,
we were near bankrupt.
you know, he went to rehab. I had to deal with the tax man.
those terrible bureaucrats!
initial. Initial. Initial. Sign.
and there's all that cash I lent him to keep paying his bitch of an ex-wife alimony and child support.
I'm glad Jeff found Jesus.
I just wish he would have found a job at the same time.
Oh, and, uh, just this little card here saying that the, uh, gun that your brother used belonged to you.
your brother had attempted suicide before and you loaned him a gun?
now, I've been turning this over for days, wondering if maybe if the gun hadn't been there...
maybe if his girlfriend would have agreed to marry him...
maybe if his ex-wife hadn't have hounded him for every dime.
and, you know, with this insurance and all the money that you'll
$2 million sounds like it would lift a lot of burdens.
under the radar, and keep it that way, please.
knowing that I'll never talk to Jeff again, I can tell you that insurance is no relief at all.
okay, chief, we blew up pictures from the crime scene.
now, look.
so, this looks like someone might have been there shooting the gun.
what else do we know?
the apartment belongs to the church where Jeff went.
it's kind of a residence hotel for members who were getting back on their feet again.
I spoke to the minister myself, pastor Paul Hicks of the new church of good faith.
he said you can look through the apartment, no problem.
he'll send over Jeff's girlfriend to open it up for you.
okay, thank you, commander.
detective Sanchez, how are you feeling?
great. Uh, good. No problem.
stand up, please. Lift your arm.
does this hurt? - No.
how about this? - No.
this? - No.
chief, he's fine, really.
we just got a couple of doctor reports that are still outstanding, and it'll be done.
I'd like to see those reports as soon as they come in.
all right, detective.
at least you're back and not hurting. That's something.
hold down the fort for us, please.
you ready, buzz?
roll him out, lieutenant.
almost ready, chief!
take your time, lieutenant.
there you are.
and ready. - Okeydoke.
there's the bullet hole.
no clothes. No books. No computer.
thank you.
I can't get my landlord to fix a faucet, and after three days,
this place is all cleaned up and ready to rent again.
our church doesn't rent these places, sir.
and the cleaning was mostly done by some service recommended by the police.
we just repainted the walls, boxed up Jeff's stuff, and stacked it by the door.
and where's that stuff now?
maybe pastor Paul has it.
and Jeff's car, too. I - I didn't see it when I parked to let you in.
Beth, I-I know this must be hard for you, but...
I can't even imagine.
you must be very, very upset.
and mad.
I don't understand it.
I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma last year.
I'm fighting so hard to stay alive.
I don't get how he could do this.
I just don't get it.
I hate to mention it, but I-I know that Jeff asked you to marry him.
Jeff didn't shoot himself because I turned down his marriage proposal.
I don't know if you'll understand this.
I met Jeff before I knew I had cancer, but we didn't start dating until afterwards.
I thought,"maybe he's only asking me 'cause I'm sick."
so I told him...
try again when we beat this thing.
besides...
this is not how I wanted to look on my wedding day.
the ring was beautiful, though. 2 carats.
maybe I should have accepted it.
anyway...
so...
does any of this furniture belong to you?
Oh, no. We weren't living together.
no. This is all church property, really.
pastor Paul will find someone else who needs it.
chief, we're set.
Oh, okay.
Beth, would you mind calling pastor Paul and letting him know that
we're gonna stop by to speak with him if he's available?
he'll be available. - Okay.
we're a fairly small congregation.
um, lieutenant, would you please escort beth to her car? Thank you.
Andy, come closer, please. - You got it, Mike.
chief, when the shot was fired, the victim's head was angled towards the right corner of this bathroom, above the commode.
so, he's right, Mike? - Yeah. There you go.
so he's standing right here, okay?
all right, so...
I'm Crawford's height.
if I put my ring finger on the trigger, gun behind my right ear...
there's not enough room.
so...
bang... He drops.
someone moved the body. Okay.
I'm gonna have my parents meet me at this church,
and then I am delegating the rest of the day to y'all.
I just want to say one thing.
it will make life easier for everyone if we continue to treat this death as a suicide.
is that understood?
all right, then.
let's find out who murdered Jeff Crawford.
Hello, mama. I - I'm sorry I'm late.
I have a new possible venue I want y'all to look at in Hollywood.
what kind of church you say this was?
well, we're unaffiliated with any major denominations.
five years ago, I was just a real-estate agent with a morning bible-study group in Northridge.
now we're a church.
and as we grow, we need bigger spaces.
so when we had the opportunity to purchase this skating rink for only $100 a square foot
you sound like quite a shrewd investor, pastor.
see a man diligent in his business, and he shall stand before kings.
we flipped a couple of small businesses, and then we plow the profits back into the ministry.
the apartment building you were in today
it houses several people with critical problems
folks out of rehab, folks who have lost their homes.
would it be rude to ask if we could sit in with this prayer group over there?
that is an in-reach meeting.
uh, overcoming sexual addiction.
we- we're gonna go look around while you talk to Brenda.
come on, Willie Ray. Let's see how they've sanctified the concession stand.
uh, this is a church.
when Jeff came to us two years ago, he was broken, looking to heal.
and over time, his spirits improved greatly.
and supervising renovations here boosted his self-esteem.
you knew about Jeff crawford's past, and still you gave him access to your finances?
if you're asking if I knew he was an addict who embezzled money from his brother...
Yes, I knew who he was.
and I knew who he was struggling to become.
coffee, anyone?
he raised money for our building fund.
and he set up internet sites for several members of our church with health issues but no insurance, like beth.
in fact, the web pages he put together to raise donations for her chemo actually became the protype for all our members in financial crisis.
and he helped me renovate this building while we used it as a house of worship.
so, when he didn't show up for services on Sunday morning...
Oh, oh, completely unlike him, especially since he helps me set up the sound system.
so, when I was finished here...
I let myself into his apartment.
you had a key, huh?
somewhere, but I didn't need one. He left one out for people.
do you no longer think his death was a suicide?
we're just trying to clear up a few inconsistencies.
like why it appears that Jeff's body was moved after he was shot.
I did that. - Why?
uh, well, when I saw him lying there, my impulse was to help.
isn't that what anyone would do?
of course. Of course it is, sir.
one last thing -- all of Jeff's belongings were packed up,
and someone just swooped in and grabbed them all, including his car.
that would be his ex-wife, I'm sure.
she called yesterday and asked if I would give back the money Jeff donated to the church,
if you can believe that. Dana crawford.
I've got her number here somewhere- here it is.
tell me, pastor, do you always preach in sandals?
I do. Same as jesus.
Brenda... Would you believe they do baptisms in a hot tub?
what about weddings, pastor?
you know, roller derby always seemed to me like the perfect preparation for marriage.
lieutenant.
ma, daddy, would you come with me?
Brenda, I...
I don't want to seem old-fashioned, but this place
Oh, no. I - I know, daddy.
it was just a thought, and if y'all don't like it...
this suicide has turned out to be a lot more complicated than I'd expected.
so if y'all could just keep looking without me and take real good pictures,
I'm pretty sure I could meet up with you at about 3: 00.
we were supposed to look for the place you're gonna marry Fritz together.
and you investigate murders, not suicide.
daddy, please don't make this harder for me.
I- I want to come with y'all, but I just - I can't be in two places at one time.
I'll, um - I'll meet with you soon, okay?
you remember where the door is? Okay.
do you mind? I just got off a shift, and i'm dying.
actually, I - I do, Ms. Crawford.
can I offer you a piece of candy instead?
what do you have?
uh, well, let's see.
it's yours.
so, what did Jeff do?
no. I know he killed himself, obviously.
but he must have stolen something, too, or I wouldn't be back here at the L. A.P. D.
I'm just investigating his suicide, Ms. Crawford,
which has been made much more difficult because his belongings are missing.
what are you looking for?
an explanation.
a suicide note on his computer, perhaps.
no, I didn't see one.
you do have his computer, then.
Yeah, I gave it to my son.
ms. Crawford, you may not realize this,
but since you're no longer next of kin and his brother, Ed, is Jeff's actual heir, you had no right to remove any of his
did Jeff have a right to empty our bank accounts, spend all our kids' college money on drugs?
I think what he had belongs to me.
including another woman's engagement ring?
his girlfriend told us that he offered her a diamond ring, and we couldn't find it anywhere.
I didn't see any engagement ring. Trust me.
I looked through everything.
you want to understand why Jeff is dead?
how about this - Jeff stole from anyone he was close to
that church, his new girlfriend, cancer girl.
he probably robbed them all blind and then felt guilty about it.
he always felt guilty whenever he screwed anybody over.
then pbht!
well, Ms. Crawford, thank you so much for stopping by.
uh, I'm gonna send one of my officers home with you to retrieve your ex-husband's belongings, including his automobile.
no. You won't.
because I'm not turning anything over to you people.
ms. Crawford, do I need to remind you that you have no right to any of your ex-husband's belongings?
so sue me!
I'll do better than that.
Dana Crawford, you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you're arresting me? What for?
we'll start with grand theft and see what else comes to mind.
uh, lieutenant Flynn, I need you, please.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford - you can't do this.
I have to get home and make dinner for my kids!
well, you could always choose to cooperate.
or I could call the department of children and family services.
I'm sure that they would be happy to hold your kids while we investigate.
and while you're in jail, you could quit smoking.
Ugh, if this pile of crap represents the sum total of Crawford's worldly possessions,
I'm beginning to understand his interest in an afterlife.
a bill for beth Gibson's cancer treatment from crawford's car.
one round of chemotherapy -- $6, 600?
Yeah, Crawford thought cocaine was an expensive habit.
and here's some past-due credit-card notices, a court warning for unpaid child support.
I ran a master inquiry on Jeff Crawford, and a contact card came up from Saturday night.
apparently, there was a disturbance at a doctor's office,
but the crime report wasn't finished 'cause Jeff took off before anyone got there.
but the nurse said he was asking for drugs.
he asked for drugs at the doctor's office?
lieutenant.
detective Sanchez's papers. You said you'd have them for me.
chief, I'm still working on getting the last of it done.
but, geez, can't you wait a couple of days?
honestly, he's okay.
Hey, chief. How's the delegating going?
great.
any sign of the engagement ring?
no.
chief, pastor Hicks is here.
I talked him into stopping by again like you asked.
you want me to handle this?
uh, you know what? I'll be in and out really fast.
just in and out really fast. Uh, detective. Thank you.
lieutenant Flynn, just one minute. One minute.
pastor Hicks, thank you so much for stopping by.
I just have a few things for you to sign.
and would you mind going over a summary of the statement that you gave us yesterday just to make sure it's accurate? Thank you so much.
what is this consent form?
that allows us to examine your church finances, including associated accounts like beth Gibson's recovery fund.
no way. I will not open church accounts without a court order.
then I'll ask for a search warrant.
on what grounds?
how would you justify invading our privacy? - Jeff crawford, - a man with a history of financial malfeasance - By alleging that we are the unknowing victims of a theft by Jeffrey crawford?
"unknowing" -- that's your word.
how can we be sure you didn't know?
so now I'm somehow responsible for his suicide?
I talked Jeffrey into rehab. I saved him from addiction. This is incredible.
what strikes me as incredible is how a man in the throes of financial disaster was somehow able to purchase a diamond engagement ring.
with a loan on a deposit of $500.
I even co-signed the financing papers.
so, where's the ring now, padre?
when beth turned him down, he returned it for the deposit...
and then immediately donated the cash into Beth's health fund because he was such a monster.
first, this was a suicide. Now you're accusing a minister of murder?
no accusations were made. I only asked to check on the finances.
and I went through the proper channels.
look, let's step back a little bit here.
pastor Hicks - he might be upset right now,
but if the accounts reveal no theft connected to the victim,
perhaps a simple apology tomorrow from chief Johnson might do the trick.
in terms of contributions to the recovery fund the victim set up for his girlfriend,
the account balances out perfectly, including a $500 deposit that the victim made days before his death.
great. In other words, clean as a whistle.
but pastor Hicks flips funds around in ways that would impress a Swiss banker.
and you're suggesting this is a motive for murder?
if I didn't believe that a murder had taken place, why would I be pursuing this?
well, I don't know. Because it's what you do.
when you're a hammer, everything in the world looks like a nail.
yes? Hello?
chief, you do realize your parents have been waiting in your office for an hour and a half.
Yes, lieutenant, if you could just keep them occupied for one more moment, please.
no, no, you don't understand.
I - I wasn't here when they arrived.
they've been stuck in your office all this time with Flynn.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
in five seconds, I have to prepare you for what you're about to face.
my suggestion is, don't argue, don't defend.
just say,"I'm sorry." You got it? "I'm sorry."
I'm - I'm - I'm so sorry.
Brenda Leigh, I know my time's not worth anything, but your mother deserves better.
Oh, Clay, please. I can speak for myself.
answer me one question.
do you intend to go through with this wedding?
of course!
did we stop on our way to Hawaii for nothing?
I mean, you've got us running hither and thither and yon. Why?
daddy, of course I'm getting married! - You know what? We're all hungry.
starving, actually. Why don't we have a nice dinner?
just, you know, the four of us. - Not me. I'm tired.
I've got indigestion. I want to lay down.
daddy, please. I want to talk about this. I just
clay? Clay? - Daddy?
are you all right? - Daddy?
somebody call an ambulance, and bring me an aspirin for him.
daddy? - Hey, we need some help here!
sit. Sit. Sit. Are you okay?
daddy! Daddy!
stay here. Stay here. Stay here.
well, the doctor said that the stent in your father's main left artery - had closed off. - Ma...
when did daddy get a stent put in his heart?
Brenda, now don't be upset with us.
your father had his first heart attack over two years ago.
you were miles away, and we didn't want to bother you.
besides, this wasn't nearly as bad as the last time.
how do you know?
when I had my first heart attack...
the pain was so bad, I wanted to die.
this time, I just wanted to kill you.
sorry, daddy.
I- I didn't mean to put you off. I just
Brenda Leigh, I don't want to hear you say "I'm sorry" one more time.
the doctor said the stent was bad and that I was lucky to be in a police station when it collapsed.
so you can't take credit for all my suffering.
and if you want to do something that would make me feel better,
you can go out and get me a bottle of aspirin.
daddy, it's a hospital.
if you need an aspirin, they've got plenty.
$10 a pill.
as long as I'm in this bed, they've got one hand in my chest and one hand in my wallet.
when I see that itemized bill - insurance doesn't cover everything, you know
it's gonna be enough to make my heart stop dead.
daddy, don't say that.
I know I may not always show it the right way, but...
I love you so much.
how's he feeling? - Good.
we just need to pick up a few things from the pharmacy.
Oh, um, we're in a cardiac ward.
it says everywhere "no cellphones."
Oh, that's just a suggestion.
detective daniels. Oh, thank god you're still there.
better. Thank you.
uh, that medical bill for beth Gibson's chemo?
could you pull it for me, please, right now?
thank you so much.
set. - Okay.
ms. Gibson, thank you so much for coming in.
how are you feeling today?
physically -- the further from chemo, the better.
spiritually -- I'm sick to death.
well, I don't know what kind of help I can give you for your soul,
but I might be able to help with the nausea.
first, could you please help me sort through some of Jeff's things here?
is there anything here that doesn't belong or anything missing?
well, that's not his gun. - How do you know?
because his was borrowed from his brother, and it was more old-fashioned.
Yes, it was. You've got a good eye, beth.
that helps me a lot. This is my gun.
now, one more thing.
I'm told that the drugs most commonly used to treat multiple myeloma are excuse me while I butcher the names -- oncovin, decadron, and doxil.
which one are you receiving?
well, it's more of a mixture, really.
pastor Paul tells me I should think of my treatments as part drugs and part prayer.
but your medical statement should be itemized.
you get so much as an aspirin, and they charge you for it.
we found this bill in Jeff's car
I guess he needed it for the doctor's address
and it says here that you paid over $6, 000 for a single chemotherapy treatment.
but without specifically naming the drugs, I - I was concerned that you might not have gotten what you paid for.
so we visited your oncologist's office today and showed him this picture of Jeff.
now, the receptionist said she remembers him from an incident last Saturday, you know, where the police were called because Jeff stormed in, demanding drugs and better painkillers for you?
and the doctor told us that he didn't give Jeff the drugs or the painkillers for you
because, well, you aren't a patient.
you did see this oncologist last year, but when your biopsy results were negative, you didn't return.
I would say your faith made you whole.
but, as it turns out, you were never sick to begin with.
and this bill - It's a fake.
you forged it, so, instead of a miracle, that makes your good health more of a scam.
Beth Gibson, you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you by the state.
have you heard and understood these rights?
o - okay.
listen, I - I found a lump under my arm, and I had a biopsy,
and I shared my fear at a prayer meeting...
and people were so worried for me.
I - I felt so loved, so cared for.
and - and I knew that if I told them that I was fine, all that would go away.
so this all began very innocently.
judge not lest ye be judged.
I believe that with my whole heart.
but - and this is important, Beth
people want to understand why Jeff crawford shot himself in the head.
and I think you know why.
now, after Jeff came back from the doctor that you weren't seeing, what happened?
I'd never seen anyone so angry.
and disappointed.
first, I thought, you know, maybe he'd be at least a little happy that I wasn't dying, but...
that didn't happen.
he cried. I cried.
but then he calmed down, and he forgave me.
because he said god would forgive me,
but that I had to go in front of the whole church and pastor Paul, too, and ask their forgiveness.
and I said I would.
and then...
and then I left.
but I should have stayed.
he needed to be with someone.
well, if it's any solace, Jeff didn't die alone.
what's that?
that's a photo of the blood left on the door of the bathroom where Jeff was shot.
to most, it looks like an abstract painting.
but to us, it looks like the outline of the person that shot him.
and it fits you perfectly.
you already told me that you knew Jeff had a gun.
you even described it for me. Not that it matters, really.
why do you say that?
that website set up to pay for your chemo treatment
every donation you accepted becomes a count of wire fraud,
each one punishable by three years in prison.
and, sweetheart, those years pile up real fast.
you should have spent some of that money going to the doctor.
keeping it -- that's how I knew you were a fraud!
listen, I was even gonna give back all of the money raised for my medical treatments and marry him.
I - I only picked up the gun to scare him, and then it went off.
all I asked from Jeff was some time...
to make it look like I'd gotten well.
but he wouldn't even give me that.
well, maybe Jeff wasn't willing to give you time, but we will.
I know a life sentence can seem daunting.
but on the bright side, at least you don't have cancer.
gentlemen.
ms. Gibson, you're under arrest for the murder of Jeff crawford.
and if you don't mind my saying it, may god have mercy on your soul.
ur father?
Oh, uh, thanks for asking. He's being released tomorrow.
luckily, they have trip insurance for their cruise.
can't travel for another week, so he'll be recuperating with us.
well, good luck with that.
Oh, listen, I checked into the Sanchez situation for you.
the head of physical rehab says his recovery has been nothing short of amazing,
and he's signed off on a return to full active duty.
good.
unfortunately, behavioral does not agree, and they won't until Sanchez cooperates with a therapist.
lieutenant Provenza's been covering for Julio. I - I knew it!
let's give Provenza a break.
I mean, Sanchez literally took a bullet for him.
the lieutenant's just trying to help the guy.
my advice is, we let him. Provenza's cagey. He'll find a way.
Thanks.
that's what you need...
Hey, chief.
working on getting that paperwork for you.
it should be here any day.
all right.
keep me informed, lieutenant.
okay. Here we go.
good. Good.
okay, daddy. Now, is that better?
compared to what?
I ought to be watching the Hawaiian sunrise over your mother, and here I am,
sitting on your couch, about to watch "the price is right.
well, at least it comes on earlier here.
your father always wins the big showcase.
know the true value of things.
that's the way the Johnsons were raised.
now that we have your father settled,
how would you like to be married on the balcony of a nice hotel room overlooking the ocean with just your father and me and Fritz's sister as witnesses?
and then we could come back here for a big party afterwards?
Oh, ma. How do you always know?
well, this time, she had a spy.
Oh, I just have one tiny, tiny request.
I know this ceremony isn't supposed to be as formal
no, no, no, no, no, ma. I want to wear your dress.
I- I promise, I- I would never pretend about something so important.
that's good.
then it's settled.
Brenda Leigh, your television's not working!
I can't get it to come on.
how come y'all have about a million remotes and not one of them works?
you know, I have a feeling, now that these wedding plans are exactly the way you want them...
it may just happen.
you can count on it.
Oh, there we go.
there's nothing but snow. It looks like the arctic!
I think I see a dogsled in there.
can't you get it to turn on?
clay, calm down right now or I'm gonna get it on c-span and leave you here all by yourself.
now, let me see.
I found a clue -- to a murder.
you guys handle murders, right?
so, what's this big clue?
it's all on this disposable phone
text messages.
let me see.
what is it worth to you?
are you nuts?
I should arrest you right now for wasting our time.
what's your name again?
Sam Linsky.
um, look, okay.
I got like 20 hours community service left.
you guys are cops.
you guys can make that go away, right?
what was your offense?
I threw a banana peel out of my car right in front of the California highway patrol.
so you littered is what you did.
well, I -- a banana peel's biodegradable.
and I was driving -- I was driving a hybrid.
this is a real crime. This is murder.
give me the phone, and I'll see what we can do.
that's good.
check out those text messages -- pretty scary stuff.
shut up.
they're talking about offing some dude, right?
am I right?
where did you find this?
uh, by the 110.
I'm sorry.
something out there is really affecting my allergies.
Oh, my
I can't even make out the letters.
lieutenant, my future sister-in-law
is on her way to my house right now,
and I was supposed to cook dinner.
are you sure this is important?
my gut says yeah.
okay.
why are the words so tiny?
who were they texting to -- mice?
Hey, look.
come with me,
and we'll fix it so that we can all read it at the same time.
go on.Gget!
I love you.
you love me.
can't we just run away together?
after, we can be together forever,
and we'll have all the money for ourselves.
I miss your voice.
we can't use our own phones anymore.
Bergman's/6. Vermillion/7.
Tai Pei/Murray/930.
please don't let him come home and paw me.
I hate him.
he has to die. Dead. Dead. Dead.
sounds like our kind of girl, all right.
Yeah. okay, Buzz.
scroll down to the place that I showed you, please.
Yeah. It's done.
are you sure?
he's dead.
are you okay?
it's my job. I'm fine.
looks like an accident. No one will know.
call u soon.
it's his job? Was she dating a hit man?
and two days later.
we have 2 meet. Need to c u.
must b mourning. We can't talk.
please.
stay away.
I'll text u when it's safe.
okay. And then two days after that?
where are u?
y didn't you say it would be like this?
she stops answering him. The rest are all incoming.
U can't do this to me. Don't ignore me.
you used me, and -- and...
she used her boyfriend to kill her husband
and then cut off communication.
now we know why she tossed the phone.
all right, lieutenant Tao,
what do we know about these phone numbers?
both are registered as prepaid,
but I'm trying to find out where they were sold.
but there were no voice calls on either one, just texts.
want me to call the other number, chief?
we can't alert the suspect,
we don't even have a victim yet.
it's dying.
what? -The cellphone's losing its charge.
for heaven's sakes. Let me take a look at that.
it's all right, chief.
the text is still in the phone, and I typed it up.
it's printing right now.
here you go.
thank you. - And I also have...
No! - What?
I left my bag of chargers at home. Oh.
did I?
they got to be here somewhere.
so, a week ago last wednesday, she texted the words Bergman's, Vermillion, Tai Pei
with numbers by them, like...
times, maybe? A schedule?
Bergman's could be the department store
probably five of them in Los Angeles.
vermillion is a color, chief -- part of the red family.
it's a shade darker than persimmon.
that's helpful.
and Tai Pei is the capital of Taiwan.
that's also a great Chinese joint on Ventura.
but I think you're on to something, chief.
it sounds like the victim's itinerary.
so Tai Pei and Murray could be a name on a reservation
or an employee.
all right -- detective Daniels,
please have the coroner's office compile a list
of all the men who died in the county last week.
let's include Ventura, Riverside,
and Orange counties as well.
lieutenant Provenza, let's compare Wednesday night's reservations from that Chinese restaurant, Tai Pei, with the names of the dead people
on detective Daniels' list.
sergeant Gabriel, let's do the same
with the customers from Bergman's.
and let's see if there's one name
that comes up on all three lists.
and, lieutenant Tao, I want to know everything I can about those cellphones, please.
and, detective Sanchez,
if you could find out what "vermillion" might actually be.
I'm so behind!
Hey, honey!
sister!
sister, sister, sister, sister, sister, sister, sister!
Claire.
Claire! Claire, Claire, Claire.
my sister Claire.
you're gonna break her.
relax, Fritzi.
you know Howard women don't break so easily.
I'm not a Howard woman just yet.
just one more week to go.
and what a week it's gonna be,
because I am here to help you.
take a gander.
Oh. I made a sprout salad.
I have a vegetarian chicken potpie,
my self-award-winning tofurkey, and for dessert, we have carob-and-walnut souffl?
I hope you like vegan.
Claire. you shouldn't have.
I was gonna cook.
Oh, no, no, no.
she insisted.
and you weren't here.
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I-I was, delayed.
and, on -- on the way home,
I had to pick up a charger for a disposable phone.
um, sorry. Let me just, plug in this cellphone.
I need it for my case.
must be pretty interesting.
I see a lot of shadows around that phone.
very spooky. Would you like for me to hold it a moment?
Why? -Didn't I tell you, honey?
Claire's decided she's a psychic.
Really?
I-I did not know that.
actually, it's not a decision, it's a gift.
I've had it since I was a child.
remember the time I saved your life?
I warned you not to step out of the tree house.
Yeah, because you pulled the ladder away.
look, I don't want to fight.
anyway, I prefer the word "intuitionist."
people hear the word "psychic," and they think "wack job."
what kind of dressing do you want on your sprout salad?
I have red curry peppercorn, and I have organic goddess.
don't tell me! I know exactly what you want!
I'm gonna grab a Scotch.
no. Honey.
so you don't know the name of your victim yet?
not yet.
okay, well, nowadays, I mostly just read auras.
as a matter of fact, I even started my own consulting company called Claire-voyance.
isn't that cute? Remind me to give you a card.
but in addition to romantic and financial advice,
I sometimes help local law enforcement agencies
back in Jersey with murders and missing persons.
Oh, thank you.
h-how many cases have you solved?
well, mostly I just give tips,
but I think I've contributed to about 100 investigations.
I thought you had an exercise studio of some kind.
Yeah, back in Princeton called bodily movements.
but I had to shut it down.
I got caught in the middle of a power struggle
in the yoga community.
it's still pending.
but I'm thinking about moving to Santa Fe.
I'd be closer to you guys. Fun!
I even offered to help Fritzi here with this El Jefe case,
but I think he's too embarrassed to have me around the office.
that's not true. More tofurkey, anyone?
no? That's okay.
it keeps.
well, maybe you could help me with my murder case.
Really? Oh, Brenda, that'd be great.
and you and I can get to know each other better.
Yes. - Yeah, that's -- that's terrific.
honey, you want to help me clear?
Oh, sure. - Sit.
you're our guest.
okay. Thanks. Oh, I'm so excited!
be right back. -Me too.
to think that I've been solving cases the old-fashioned way
when help was just a telepathic message away.
look, before yoga...
...she tried glassblowing and making her own soap.
so the reason I didn't say anything about this psychic stuff was because I honestly thought
Oh, you've been working so hard,
and things are slow for us.
it's my turn to entertain the relatives.
Claire may be a bit touched,
but she seems perfectly harmless.
she might enjoy coming to my work and seeing what I do.
what? No!
no, no, no, no!
I wouldn't let her anywhere near a murder case.
do you remember when the FBI sent 30 agents in
to drain that lake in Virginia, looking for anthrax?
that was her!
what? What is the matter?
he's not done killing!
what, do you have another vision?
no, the phone's working, but he left a text message.
look!
U r dead.
for heaven's sakes.
you scared me to death.
why is your whole squad here on a Saturday?
because killers work weekends, too, Will,
and, we got a cellphone yesterday that
Yeah, I read Gabriel's report.
an unidentified woman
may or may not have talked her unidentified boyfriend
into murdering her -- yes -- unidentified husband.
well, there are a few gaps,
but we're working hard on finding out
who these people are -- or were, anyway.
and even if this was a homicide, what's the big rush?
it could have happened over a week ago.
the killer sent a text message last night -Threatening to off his girlfriend. -Why?
it looks like she dumped him after he murdered her husband,
so we're not just trying to solve a murder, Will,
we're trying to prevent one.
what are you doing here on a Saturday, anyway?
well, we have personnel issues.
I've lost a lot of experienced people in c. i.
and I need to find replacements.
it's gonna mean a promotion for somebody.
n-not from my team.
I have limited places from which I can pull,
so yes, Brenda, maybe from major crimes.
but I'm not prepared to talk about that just yet, okay?
all I want to make very clear now
is that if you don't find a victim today,
no more overtime.
but who would you take from m-my division?
you know what?
let's deal with the future when it gets here, okay?
just try not to spend all day on this case, okay?
sister! I have good news!
lieutenant Provenza here showed me all the text messages,
and I was able to get an image of the killer's face.
while you were out, I called in a sketch artist.
no. Really.
and then later we're gonna make balloon animals.
well, the victim...
Yes, I...
...I see -- I see a river and a bridge
and a nearby train...
and -- and a barking dog in the background.
and -- and an odd-looking tree.
a river, a train, and a barking dog.
throw in a pickup truck, and we've got a country song.
excuse me for a minute. I'll be right back.
well, thank you so much, Claire.
you be careful out there.
chief?
Yes.
I've never had a useful tip from a psychic ever.
she's not a psychic.
she's an intuitionist and my future sister-in-law.
Oh, come on.
do you have any idea
who's in danger of being murdered later on today?
no? well, then let's keep moving, shall we?
where are we on these text messages that look like a schedule
Bergman's, vermillion, Tai Pei?
Ah, there are nine Bergman's stores
between Orange county and Ventura.
the corporate office sent over a complete list of every credit-card transaction from last Wednesday.
unfortunately, none of them matches up with the 23 male deaths in L. A.
or the surrounding counties on that day.
lieutenant Provenza! - Yes, ma'am?
what do you know about vermillion?
no -- still -- still working on that.
but, uh, yesterday after work,
I did stop by Tai Pei for dinner.
and, Wednesday before last,
there was a reservation for a guy, last name Murray table for two at 9: 30.
manager says Murray waited half an hour,
dined alone, paid cash.
lieutenant Tao,
what do we know about those prepaid cellphones?
the phones were purchased
from the same convenience store 10 days ago
also for cash.
but the security-camera tape is on a seven-day loop,
so the footage is already gone.
and the guy behind the counter
doesn't remember who he sold the phones to.
the first marriage was devoured by jealousy.
the husband wanted his wife to stop working.
he thought she was having an affair with a co-worker.
she did have an affair with a colleague,
but that was before -- No! I see a sequoia!
No! A-a tree! No, no.
she had feelings for someone else
a man dangerous to.her heart
I should be delighted to record this.
lieutenant Flynn, why don't you stop by the convenience store where those phones were bought
and talk to the guy who sold them,
see if you can jog his memory?
chief, you can't be serious.
I mean, those people wouldn't remember a man who came in with an elephant to buy a quart of milk.
then why don't you take Claire with you?
what?
if I could just hold the clerk's hand,
I might be able to see the killer through his mind's eye.
sound good, lieutenant?
sounds great, chief.
come on, I'll give you a ride-along.
Oh, terrific. Just a second.
I just want to see this for a second.
my phone chargers!
no, make him bald, completely bald.
Yeah. Good job, everyone! See you later!
thank you! bye!
Flynn. what?
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Yeah. Me too.
chief?
Claire might be on to something.
there's the literal and there's the abstract.
Oh, come on.
not everything in this universe is visible to the naked eye.
she may be talking in images.
Yeah. Chief, "vermillion" is a play.
it's "a gothic tale of love and witchcraft"
set on the vermillion river in louisiana.
it runs in westwood till the end of the month.
they're faxing over a list of credit-card orders,
but it's a 99-seat equity-waiver house,
and the theater manager said everyone showed up.
they turned away people on standby.
chief!
Yes, lieutenant. What is it?
Vermillion's a river.
just like Claire said. -For heaven's sakes.
so, assuming our victim is a real person,
he made it to the play.
everybody showed up. So he was in westwood.
but never made it to Tai Pei.
lieutenant Provenza, what is the fastest way between the theater and the restaurant?
well, the 405,
but only some poor tourist would take that.
locals would do Beverly Glen or Sepulveda.
Why?
detective Daniels, please take a look at the list we got from the morgue and find me someone who died wednesday before last between...
the theater at 7: 00 and Tai Pei at 9: 30.
the victim of the car accident, Shawn Thompson,
was a major horror film producer.
and yes, chief, he is married.
his wife's Christine Thompson.
traffic did a detailed investigation.
now, the vehicle, a 2008 lexus sedan,
drove right off the cliff from over there.
the car was inspected.
everything was fully functional except the air bags.
they were turned off.
what's the interest?
chief!
look!
what is it, lieutenant?
a bridge -- just like Claire said we would find.
who's Claire?
she's a psychic, and she's
you guys are consulting a psychic?
no, we're not. Excuse me, lieutenant.
were there any skid marks around this accident
or signs of a collision?
no, no. Looks like he just lost control of the car.
was there a 911 call?
person reporting called from that pay phone over there.
they didn't stick around to chat, though.
no other witnesses came forward.
lieutenant, I want the 10 calls made before and after the 911 call, please.
let's, see what else we have here.
Yeah, the short-form autopsy says Mr. Thompson's injuries
were consistent with an auto accident.
he wasn't wearing a seat belt.
his blood alcohol came back . 04.
where would he have had a drink?
how about intermission at the play?
do you have to use that tone?
I mean, it's -- it's the tone. it's excuse me.
anything else, commander?
no, the only other thing I know
is that Mr. Thompson's wife, Christine,
took her husband's death pretty badly.
she may be taking it worse than you know.
excuse me.
Christine Thompson has it pretty good.
if she's still alive.
I don't know.
it looks like we took a wrong turn in Transylvania to me.
buzz it again, Buzz.
I knew you were gonna say that.
detective, do you think you can force open this gate?
well, don't have to, chief.
the lock's busted.
there's a dog barking in the background.
just like Claire said. - Oh, for heaven's sake.
Yes, lieutenant. it's uncanny.
all right, everybody.
look, look, chief.
why don't you let me call in for a search warrant?
no, I don't think there's time.
I'm now officially acting on a tip.
from who -- a psychic?
we have exigent circumstances.
Christine Thompson's life was threatened.
all right, detective.
car's running in the garage!
don't move! don't move!
relax, gentlemen. He's not armed.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, no pulse. She's long gone, chief.
so her boyfriend threatens to kill her,
so she commits suicide?
how does that make sense?
would someone please call the paramedics?
I want her taken out of here in an ambulance.
but, chief, she's dead.
well, then you better hurry.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh...my...god.
what?
chief, look.
a train.
the river, the bridge, the barking dogs, the train
everything Claire said.
it's all happening.
chief?
Yes, lieutenant. I'll be right there.
just -- just a word. I'm -- I'm sorry.
I don't know if you've noticed,
but, Gabriel and Daniels can hardly stand to be in the same room together anymore.
I already issued an order
for them to sort out their romantic problems.
you -- you are an excellent leader, chief,
but...you can't just boss around the human heart.
lieutenant, I am in the middle
of a double homicide investigation.
I don't want to talk about this right now.
I don't want to talk about it, either, but, look.
Sanchez was gone for four months on a disability leave,
and then
and then Gabriel took a week off for some training,
and Daniels was off at some homeland security labs
for two weeks.
I mean, look, I may not be a psychic,
but as an experienced civil servant,
I can tell you this
the brass Will not let you do with six people
what you've proven you can do with five.
chief Pope told me this morning
that he may have to promote someone from major crimes
to the C. I. division.
well, there it is, then. There it is.
and I'm telling you, chief.
h-he could take Sanchez or Tao or even Flynn.
and our problem would still be the same,
and it's sitting right out there.
let's talk about this tomorrow.
chief.
that's twice in one day!
speak of the devil.
what's that about?
nothing, nothing. What's up?
I was at the morgue
checking on a murder for harbor division,
and Dr. Morales complained
that you had a "creepy lady" down there with lieutenant Flynn talking to a corpse.
she's not a creepy lady.
her name is claire, and she's my future sister-in-law.
she helped us find the victim.
Really? how?
Claire did not help us find the victim.
but she guided a sketch artist
into a drawing of the killer, sir.
check it out.
that's funny.
so, Fritz's sister is a psychic.
no, she's an intuitionist.
okay.
well, tell Claire that I have a good alibi for the suicide that you found today,
which brings me to the question I came here to ask.
Oh, one second.
sergeant, did, did the, uh...
sergeant Gabriel,
did Christine Thompson's attempted suicide
make it to the evening news?
uh, top story.
they're saying she's gonna make it.
okay, so exactly how dead does this woman have to be
before we announce it?
if the killer thinks that she's still alive,
we can use that to our advantage when we catch him.
Oh, may we just discuss the pros and cons
of whether there is a murder here?
um, pro.
Christine had a gash in her head,
suggesting the killer knocked her out
and threw her to the ground and started the engine.
con.
she had second thoughts about suicide,
tried to get out of the car, was overcome by fumes,
fell, and hit her head.
the lock on the front gate was broken,
suggesting forced entry.
but we don't know when the lock was broken.
and no prints.
so why kill yourself after you've gone through all the trouble to have your husband murdered?
clearly, there are many possible explanations,
but we do have that cellphone
that led us right to Shawn Thompson and his wife.
and when we went to find out what was left of the car,
we found a dress from Bergman's that he picked up for his wife Last Wednesday at 6: 00 p. m.
so, Mr. Thompson's schedule for the day he died
was exactly what the text message said it would be.
we dumped the pay phone by the scene of the accident,
and when Mr. Thompson drove his car off the road,
someone called for a cab -- America taxi.
Yeah, Flynn stopped there on his way back from the morgue to talk to the cabdriver.
Oh, my god! you made the arrest!
no, Claire.
this is my boss, assistant chief Will Pope.
Oh, I must have sensed you
hovering around the case or something.
Mm. yeah, I do that sometimes. I-I hover.
excuse me.
well, major crimes seems to have had
some very good hunches on this.
but unless you're planning to hold a seonce,
the victims are not going to tell you how they died.
so let's find some physical evidence from, you know,
our plane of existence and wrap this up, all right?
good night, everybody.
pleasant dreams.
Oh. Skeptics.
some people just won't believe what they can't see.
like juries.
lieutenant Flynn, anything?
okay, well, I spoke to the cabdriver,
and he said Wednesday night before last,
he picked up a fare at the bus stop Where Shawn Thompson's car went off the road.
but all he could remember about the passenger
was that he was a white guy younger than me.
so we're back to nowhere.
not exactly.
like Claire, I can also see the invisible.
give me a person's phones,
and I can draw you a picture of their entire life,
maybe even tell you their destiny.
and when I am done
we will have fulfilled Claire's prophecy.
I dumped all the phones registered to Christine Thompson.
I then created a list of the most commonly used numbers
in the past months leading up to her husband's death.
this was her husband, Shawn.
they spoke a lot during the day.
over here -- mother from Sherman Oaks.
she had a sister in connecticut she spoke to on a weekly basis.
and then this number.
A. Raber.
the number first appears four months ago.
watch how the relationship develops.
in the beginning, they speak once every two or three days.
then things heat up.
they talk all the time.
and then this.
what?
nothing.
they suddenly stop speaking.
and on that exact same day, two prepaid cellphones
are purchased from a convenience store.
so they began texting before her husband's murder.
well, how does this fulfill my prophecy exactly?
we found the bridge, the river, the train, the barking dog.
what could be more odd-looking than a phone tree?
I did it! I really did it!
this is exciting! who's A. Raber?
don't you already know?
his name is Andrew Raber.
he's a stunt man for television and film.
andrew Raber.
all right.
his film credits include "house of death,"
"Sorority death house," "camp murder 1,"
camp murder 2
Yeah, and all those masterpieces
were produced by the same guy -- one Shawn Thompson.
so Shawn knew Andrew.
and based on her cellphone records,
Christine knew him, too.
we pulled Mr. Raber's highlight reel off of his website.
go ahead, Buzz.
I think you're gonna find this interesting, chief.
buzz, uh, stop it there and roll it back.
play that last part again, please.
all righty.
Oh, would you look at that?
it's my job," he said.
crashing vehicles and falling out of cars.
and he does. Might as well have filmed the murder.
but with no witnesses.
I just can't believe this is our guy.
how was I so thrown off?
that's not how I pictured him at all.
not how I pictured him.
lieutenant Flynn,
I need you to get the cabdriver in here
and the sketch artist, too.
okay, but who's she gonna draw?
the killer.
so, you're a stunt man, right?
Yeah.
that's cool.
what's the craziest stunt you ever did?
come on in. Oh, hello.
Hi.
why did you bring this raber guy in on a Sunday
when you have nothing on him?
because he's already killed two people,
and I don't like the idea of him running around on his own.
all right.
and you can prove he's a killer?
well, I have a cabdriver coming in who
who saw nothing. And?
and I have a sketch artist who
right. Who just drew a picture off the monitor. And?
and I have Christine Thompson.
who is dead. Not completely.
technically, though,
by the standards of the justice system
and, you know, reality -- dead.
I have a plan, sir, and the sooner I execute it,
the faster we'll all be able to get off the clock.
so, shall I?
thank you.
Oh, Buzz.
uh, let me know as soon as the cabdriver comes in.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, no. No, no. You wait here.
you're a virgo, aren't you?
stay out of my head, lady.
Yeah, well, half the stuff you see in movies isn't real.
right. And what about the other half?
andrew Raber?
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
thank you so much for coming in.
how are you this morning?
a little annoyed.
Oh, really? Why is that?
you guys pull me out of my house,
drag me downtown, and read me my rights
without an explanation.
it's like Guantanamo bay in this place.
Oh, look at those terrible scrapes on your hand!
how'd you get those?
I'm a stunt man. Get banged around a lot.
I'm the guy you don't see in movies.
part of the showbiz magic.
well, speaking of showbiz,
we have a couple of questions for you about a movie producer.
a Mr. Shawn Thompson?
I believe that you're a regular player in his horror films.
as you may know,
Mr. Thompson tragically died in a car accident last week.
Yeah. It's pretty shocking.
and just yesterday, it seemed that his wife, Christine,
locked herself in her garage with her Bentley running
almost died.
Yeah, I saw something about that on the news. Is she okay?
thanks to her barking dogs.
a neighbor called 911 -- saved her life.
we're here.
we've got her in protective custody.
protective custody? Why?
chief, the cabdriver's arrived,
and they're moving into position.
well, we have reason to believe
that what happened to Christine
was less attempted suicide and more of an attempted murder,
which is why we wanted to talk to you.
to me? Why?
well, you were having an affair with Christine, weren't you?
are you kidding?
having a -- no.
who told you that? I never
uh, hold on. Hold on
before you say something you're gonna have to take back later.
let me show you what we have.
phone records.
these show that you and Christine
spoke several times a day for months.
we, uh
I met Christine on one of Shawn's films.
she visited the set during one of the stunts,
but, I swear, it was just a friendship.
ask him if he rides a motorcycle.
what are you doing?!
I'm seeing a motorcycle.
give that to me! But -- No! But
let go! I'm seeing an angry wind!
Brenda, this is important! Ask about the angry wind!
I am tired of farting around with you, lady!
Brenda -- give me this microphone right now!
no, Claire... no, no...
No!
I'm telling you, if you touch this microphone again,
when the chief comes out of there,
you may be speaking to dead people in person.
now, you get.
do you recognize this disposable cellphone?
should I?
uh, Christine gave me that when we rescued her.
she said you bought it for her
and another one just like it
and that you used them
to help her plan the murder of her husband.
that's a lie.
this phone texts Shawn's entire schedule the day of the accident
the department store, the play, the Chinese restaurant.
but he never made it to the restaurant, did he?
because you drove his car off a cliff.
What?! Hey!
Sit...down.
she's a lying bitch.
I've never seen that phone before in my life.
I've always been fascinated by movie stunts.
tell me -- did you knock Shawn out
and then point his car toward the cliff,
and then roll out at the last second, or
listen to me. I wasn't there.
after you staged the accident,
you used a pay phone to call a taxicab
that picked you up at a bus stop down the street.
do you remember that cabdriver?
cause he remembers you.
Hello, sir. good to see you again.
thank you so much, Billy.
let's go.
was that him? I was just guessing.
we've been doing a lot of that lately.
who's Billy?
she meant you, Einstein.
in addition to the cabdriver, we have other witnesses
that saw you leaving the crime scene.
there -- there were witnesses?
it was dark outside.
you might not have seen them, but they saw you.
and this is the picture that they helped our sketch artist draw.
notice the similarity?
your girlfriend's pretty upset
you tried to kill her, Andrew.
and afraid.
she said she was just joking around
when she talked to you about killing her husband.
she was stunned that you actually did it
and even more surprised when you locked her in the garage
with the car running.
Oh, my god.
now, you listen to me.
if you don't tell me what happened,
I'm gonna have to go with Christine's version of the events.
she'll walk, and you'll end up facing the death penalty.
but if she solicited this murder
and suggested that you and she would live on Shawn's money
Oh, I never gave a damn about Shawn's money!
I only loved Christine.
and...I thought she loved me.
s-she made all these promises to me.
and after I did it...
...she blew me off.
she blew him off...
like an angry wind.
she used me to get Shawn's money.
bitch!
I thought she loved me.
I need some proof if I'm gonna charge Christine.
she bought him the tickets to "vermillion."
and she gave me the other set of keys to his car.
I was,
hiding in the backseat when he came out of the theater.
he was alive when I did it.
he, uh...
screamed at me -- "why?"
and I told him why.
because Christine wants it this way.
I should have put Harley and Davidson in the garage with her.
it's your classic road bike.
Harley and Davidson?
her stupid dogs.
you, uh...
you believe me, don't you?
Oh, yes.
I think I do.
then do me a favor, will you?
what's that?
tell Christine I'll see her in hell.
guess what, she is already there.
salty corn mash, top bean, nature candy here you go so, you two are catching the bad guy?
well, we must, we are pretty good pair.
actually, I didn't help out all that much, but I have to say,
watching your future wife at work made me think that maybe I should give up the consulting business
and get into law enforcement full time.
what's going on with this, uh, El Jefe case?
setting up for the big takedown as we speak.
not much left to do.
okay, well, if you need me, you know, I'm ready
no, no, no, no. We're all set.
you got to keep yourself free for Brenda here.
Bye, sweetie. See you tonight.
Bye. Bye.
that
Bye! Bye.
watch out for left turns!
what?
never mind. Just don't read anything out loud.
Thanks, Claire.
see ya.
I can see how crazy you are about my brother.
I am. I really am.
Hey, listen.
I'm sorry about the mistake I made the other day.
what's that?
Oh, remember the vision I had about the case?
I said the victim was on her second marriage
and that her first marriage ended badly?
well, you can't be right about everything.
Yeah, but I was really off.
and I kept trying to figure out what it was.
and then I realized that I had my signals crossed.
I wasn't talking about the murder.
I was talking about you.
about me?
Yeah.
you had an affair with an office co-worker
a bald office co-worker -- which ended badly.
so then you married your first husband on the rebound,
and he was a-a jealous monster.
and that ended poorly.
so then you just got afraid
and just tired of falling for the wrong guy,
which is why you've been putting off marrying my brother.
you're afraid.
I...I have been afraid.
wait a minute.
did Fritz tell you about all that?
No! Absolutely not. No way.
it was lieutenant Flynn. What?!
Yeah. We also talked about your candy drawer. You didn't!
Yeah. But I got one, too!
Really? -We're exactly the same!
we're gonna get along just fine! God!
sister, sister, sister, sister, sister, sister, sister!
the video you're watching was taken last night by our surveillance cameras at L.A.X.
and the star of our little film is this man here
former real-estate mogul Allan Summers.
now, Mr. Summers has a lot of problems.
for example, he's being investigated by the FBI for fraud and embezzlement...
selling houses he didn't build and building houses he couldn't connect to power or water supplies.
since this little scheme was uncovered, it's had a fairly negative effect on Summers' finances.
in addition to spending a small fortune keeping himself out of jail, he was forced to abandon his latest residential real-estate development.
and since his company went belly-up, his partners are taking him to court for mismanagement and his employees are suing him for their lost pensions.
now, just when it seemed like things could not get worse, Mr. Summers flew into L.A.X. from Sacramento last night, was met at arrivals by a driver from his usual car service.
then, somewhere between the airport and his home, both Mr. Summers and the chauffeur completely disappeared.
stop, Buzz. Uh, can you zoom in on that card, please?
so Allan Summers and his driver have only been gone for 12 hours
not even long enough to generate a missing-persons report
so why are we here already?
because at 8: 00 this morning, Summers' wife and son went to the bank and told the manager that he had been kidnapped and was being held for ransom.
to be exact.
right, which no one could give them because Summers' assets have been frozen by the FBI.
the son then told the manager that the kidnapper had promised to kill Summers if the police were notified, so, naturally...
the bank manager called our fraud section immediately.
and fraud called in detective Mikki Mendoza here to put together this airport footage in an attempt to verify the Summerses' story.
so, Allan Summers is the target of both an FBI investigation and a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, and suddenly he goes missing?
isn't it more likely he just skipped town?
but you haven't even finished watching the video, ma'am.
excuse me. One second.
have we spoken to the Summers family yet?
look, chief Johnson...if Mrs. Summers' story is true, then her husband could be in imminent danger.
and let's not forget about the driver, and -- Is that your cat?
Yes. Sorry.
um, she either has to be with me or at the vet.
what's her name? - Kitty.
she's sick today. I need to give her a shot.
so, uh, there's more video?
buzz. - Um, hold on.
Yes, I have some footage from the exit and the short-term parking lot.
one second. Okay, that's it.
you see, that's the vehicle registered to the car service Summers hired.
Allan Summers was met by a chauffeur, but he drove himself away from the airport.
that's hardly ever a good thing.
well, it still doesn't prove that Summers was kidnapped.
the whole thing could have been staged.
and where's the driver?
speaking of whom -- Detective Sanchez?
mario Gomez. DMV says he's 50 years old. No criminal record.
thank you.
Oh, yeah, uh, detective Mikki Mendoza, this is detective Sanchez.
and this is lieutenant Tao.
and you've already met Kitty.
and thank you, lieutenant.
sergeant David Gabriel.
chief, according to the driver's boss, Gomez has been working for the car service for about six months.
this was the first time he was assigned to pick Mr. Summers up from the airport.
he didn't return his car last night, and he's not answering his cellphone.
so both Mr. Summers and his driver are still missing.
if this is a genuine kidnapping, then Mr. Gomez, the driver, must be involved.
but is he the suspect or the victim?
good morning, everyone!
morning? - Lieutenant Provenza, it's 12: 30 -- P. M.
well, my apologies. I assure you it couldn't be helped.
Hello, Mikki! You staying out of trouble, sweetie pie?
better than you are, sir. - Thatagirl.
okay, kiddos, what'd I miss?
lieutenant.
Yeah, uh, okay.
this crooked real-estate guy, Allan Summers, was picked up at L.A.X. Last night by a town car, and no one has seen him since.
summers is being investigated for fraud by the FBI, so he could have just run away.
but, uh, his family seems to think that he was kidnapped, and they want access to his frozen bank accounts so they can pay this weird ransom.
on the other hand, they could be faking the whole thing.
and it's very confusing.
so, where's the chauffeur?
at the moment, we can't find Mr. Gomez or his car.
uh, chief, I got Gomez's home address from his boss.
also, the name of one of his regular fares-- a Katherine Ortega.
he's been picking her up after work for the past five months.
she was the one who phoned in this morning when he didn't show today.
all right, thank you, sergeant.
and, detective Mendoza, I'm assuming y'all put out this missing car's plates?
we did. No one's seen it yet.
whether it was the driver or someone else, the kidnapper would have gotten rid of the car pretty quickly.
probably somewhere near the airport.
lieutenant Provenza...
I really need that car, and you seem to be awfully frisky this afternoon.
well, yes, I am.
and, chief, this is perfect weather to organize a grid search for a town car.
and I could really go for a nice, long walk around L.A.X. It'd be good for me.
okay, do we have a breathalyzer up here?
uh, thank you, lieutenant. A grid search would be very helpful.
you got it.
lieutenant Tao, I assume we have the driver's cell number.
I'll try pinging it. Maybe I can triangulate his position.
thank you, lieutenant.
chief Pope, I think now is a good time to bring the family in.
no. No way. You are to stay arm's length from the family.
Why? If this kidnapping turns out to be another one of Allan Summers' frauds, his wife and son could be involved.
and if it's not, you could wind up getting Summers killed.
look for the driver all you want, but for now, we have to assume this is a legitimate kidnapping.
if I can't interview potential suspects, and given that this kidnapping is partially a financial crime, can we at least agree that I need a forensic accountant to go over the summerses' finances?
chief.
I think I could follow the Summerses' money trail if the FBI would just share their files with me.
all right, sergeant. Do the best you can.
and, detective Mendoza, since y'all are so thorough, maybe some of your people can keep an eye on our missing chauffeur's residence in case he shows up.
we'd be more than happy to help in any way we can.
come on, Tao! I'll drive!
chief. - Yes?
Provenza is wearing a brand-new tie. It's brand-new.
something to investigate later.
lieutenant, in the meantime, if you and detective Sanchez here could help detective Mendoza...
and, sergeant... have you located our missing chauffeur's regular fare yet?
you -- you just told me to have the FBI help with the money trail.
what would you prefer -- me to contact Katherine Ortega or the FBI?
what's the matter, sergeant? You can't do two things at once?
two things at once.
Hi, Ms. Ortega. Sergeant Gabriel from the L.A.P.D.
I was calling regarding Mr. Gomez.
so, Mario's still missing?
well, here's the good news, Ms. Ortega
you know Mario, so you can help us in our search.
now, Mario was driving you to work every night and picking you up in the morning, is that right?
goodness. What kind of job keeps you out all night?
Oh, uh, data entry at a law firm. Not very exciting.
data entry, huh?
so, I'm assuming y'all didn't talk too much about work.
no. No.
did Mario mention any family members -- a wife or a girlfriend, maybe?
no.
he was married, but his wife died last year -- of cancer, I think.
um, I think that's why he's a driver now.
he needed to quit his job, be her nurse.
she needed 24-hour care. They didn't have insurance.
and after his wife passed away, he couldn't get his old job back, so that's why he came to L. A.
so, you said that Mario came to L.A.F from where?
look, you're my only link to Mario Gomez.
if you're not straight with me, and I mean right now...
I might never find him.
every second you delay could be risking his life.
okay.
he was an illegal. I hate that word, but he was an illegal.
he thought someone had been following him home to his apartment every night.
I begged him to call the police.
he said he didn't want to go back to Mexico.
look, I should have called you myself.
mario begged me not to.
mario Gomez's social security number belongs to a guy that died two years ago.
so the girl's right -- he's probably an illegal.
a lot of police here, chief.
a judge might wonder why we need this many people for a welfare check.
and I'll say it's because I'm concerned about Mario's welfare. And I am.
detective.
never mind. I'll just pick the lock.
step aside, ma'am.
No!
detective Mendoza, you are jumping the gun!
front's clear. Checking the back.
I only needed a second.
there's no pictures of his wife.
there's nothing personal here at all.
when you sneak across the border, you don't get to bring a moving van, chief.
looks like he was planning on being home after his airport run.
chief. Bedroom's clear.
found some fresh blood on this towel from the bathroom.
maybe he cut himself shaving?
well, that was kind of him. Let's have S.I.D. Check it for DNA and blood type.
I wonder if Gomez knew who was after him.
Yes, lieutenant Provenza?
found it 90 minutes in.
the driver's cellphone was thrown under the car.
this isn't pretty, chief.
how did this happen?
no casings anywhere.
this close -- it was probably a knife.
or a hatchet.
no one loses this much blood and lives -- no one.
Where's the body? Or bodies?
how did they disappear without leaving a trail?
who died?
lieutenant Tao, I need you to examine this blood spatter.
let's find out exactly what happened here.
well, one thing's for sure -- it's not just a kidnapping anymore.
no.
now it's a murder.
just put you right here.
okay, Kitty. Please don't move.
I'll try not to hurt you this time. I promise. Okay?
uh, oops.
I'll come back. - Oh, no, no. Will, Will, come in, come in.
you can help me.
okay. - Thanks.
he doesn't like it, but he won't scratch.
good.
you do all this every day?
twice.
um, Kitty's kidneys haven't been doing too well, so, um...
the, uh, vet has her on fluids and this experimental drug therapy, so Kitty has to get shots twice a day. He can't be left alone.
on the Summers case, we seem to have blood but no body, a car but no driver, and a ransom but no money to pay it.
is there any chance you've figured out who murdered whom?
well, according to Mario's regular fare, Mario was afraid for his life.
and we typed the blood in the town car to the blood on the towel in his apartment
both "O" negative.
universal victim.
but, uh, so...
so the blood could also belong...
to Allan Summers.
and in order to, check it against his medical records,
I need to contact the family.
we cannot directly contact the family.
look, this kidnapper, whoever he is, has made it very clear that he has no problem killing people.
so I'm tending to take his threats seriously.
but... in order to rule the family out completely as suspects
you may not bring the Summerses in. You may not go to them.
no contact by phone or e-mail.
now, unless you can find some other way to talk to them, that is off the table.
there, there, Kitty. There, there.
look, I need to understand the Summerses' finances.
I mean, the amount of the ransom is so ridiculous that it must mean something.
and I just don't think that sergeant Gabriel is up to the task of figuring that out.
but as far as the forensic accounting you're looking for, the FBI must already have that.
do you think, uh, Fritz could maybe get a copy of those files to sergeant Gabriel?
no, Fritz and I have decided we're keeping our personal and professional life separate.
because the FBI hates me so much.
well, uh, there's still one or two people in the bureau that'll still return my calls, so I-I'll just -- I'll take care of that. I'll
I'll see if I can finesse that for us.
thank you, Will.
Hey, Fritz. How are things? - Good. You?
uh, good, good. I'm just helping with Kitty.
well, thanks for that.
sure.
uh, all right. Good to see you.
and, uh... I'll -- I-I'll get back to you.
how's the patient?
Kitty looks good today. A little more energy.
you think?
I'm gonna get her on home.
you're gonna be here awhile, I take it, right?
Yes. I need to contact the family without contacting them and interview them without interviewing them -- that kind of thing.
well, I can tell you the FBI is feeling pretty stupid right now.
we have taps on all of Summers' phones, and we were monitoring his credit cards.
and to have him kidnapped like this is bad, awful, horrible, and crappy for us.
we're thrilled not to be officially involved, but if we can help you behind the scenes...
No! No. I don't want you talking with the FBI on my behalf.
we decided -- - all right.
all right.
Bye, Kitty. Bye-bye. Bye.
I mean... what... would they say... anyway... behind the scenes?
well, they would probably say...
give the family the money for the ransom.
in fact, if you could get proof of life on Summers, the FBI would unfreeze his accounts.
then you could put tracer bills in the cash that the Summerses withdraw, follow the transmitters, and let the ransom lead you to the kidnappers
or to Summers himself, if this is another one of his frauds.
the best thing about all of that, since you'd be running the case, is you keep total control over the money.
so... I'd be like a bank.
remember to eat.
Bye. Bye, Kitty. Bye-bye.
chief, Mrs. Summers and her son are coming into the bank right now.
excuse me. I'm Mary Summers. This is my son, Adam.
Mr. Elkins, the morning manager, called to say that you were the person to see about our... problem.
Yes, ma'am. Have a seat, Mrs. Summers.
we just need to clarify a few issues before we execute the transaction.
anything.
this is the man who picked your husband up from the airport.
his name is Mario Gomez -- works for a car service. You ever seen him before?
what? W-why would we know the chauffeurs?
Oh, god. - Don't "oh, god" me, Adam.
look, we're very grateful for your help, but we have a deadline.
why does the bank care about who was driving Allan home?
well, unfortunately, Mrs. Summers, your assets have been frozen by the FBI, and they just won't release them because we ask them to. There's protocol.
there's federal guide-- - listen to me.
there's over $5 million in that account.
that's all the money Allan and I have left in the world.
there's no place else to go for this ransom.
you have to release the funds.
you just said you would. Please!
here's the problem, Mrs. Summers.
your husband has been involved in some dodgy business ventures of late, and there's a concern that he might be faking this kidnapping in order to get money from the bank.
what? Who are you to make these accusations?
deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson of the L.A.P.D. And this is sergeant David Gabriel.
now, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
we were told "no police."
I'm sorry. That's no longer possible.
but they'll kill him!
which is why, before we pay the ransom, we have to make sure that your husband is still alive.
and we need your help with that.
how? What can we do?
well, for starters, what's your father's blood type?
it's "A" positive -- same as me.
that's good for your father.
that's not so good for Mr. Gomez. - Who?
the driver, mom. The guy who picked up dad at the airport.
the death of a chauffeur may be beneath your notice, Mrs. Summers, but it's not beneath mine.
apparently, Mr. Gomez was murdered during the abduction of your husband.
and a criminal who kills once will most likely do it again.
you mentioned a deadline?
the kidnapper's calling us back at 8: 00 tonight.
once he knows we can get the money, he'll give us more instructions.
Mrs. Summers...
your husband has been under a lot of pressure lately -- investigations and lawsuits.
is it possible he just ran away?
I -- I can't believe he would leave us like that.
Yeah, well, we couldn't believe it when he sold multimillion-dollar homes to people - without ever securing the water rights. - Adam, stop it!
and lost everything that his partners gave him and the employee pension fund -- our whole company.
well, that certainly sounds like he'd have a lot of people to run away from.
and $1 million would probably give him wouldn't even begin to cover what my father would want to start a new life somewhere else.
in fact, it's -- it's the relatively small amount of the ransom that makes me believe that my father is in a life-threatening situation.
so, we're back to the original question. What do you need from us?
when the kidnapper calls tonight, I want you to ask him to put your father on the phone.
and with your permission, we'll be listening in.
once we have proof of life, the FBI will allow us to unfreeze your money, and you can pick it up here in the morning.
and then what?
I'll try to make sure your husband doesn't end up like Mario Gomez.
well, Ms. Johnson, I suppose we have no choice but to do what you ask, even though you have done nothing but frighten us and insult us.
if anything happens to my husband
thank you so much for your cooperation, Mrs. Summers.
and you can go to hell!
okay, Sanchez is posted with Mendoza and S.I.S.
they're sitting on the Summers house.
we're also linked into the tap of their home phones over here.
okay, sergeant Gabriel, are you ready? - I am.
the FBI, who I have on hold right now, gave me a direct line into Summers' account and his password.
the moment we have proof of life, they'll allow me to unfreeze the account.
there's over $5 million here.
and the kidnappers only want a little over $1 million.
now, if Summers was behind this, don't you think he would want to take it all?
maybe he wanted to leave something behind, for his wife.
you haven't met her.
you haven't met her! Watch every penny, sergeant.
I am.
check it out, chief.
electronic tracers buried inside.
they look real, huh?
throw these babies in a stack of bills, and they'll lead us right to the bad guy.
and then we follow the money until we find our victim.
chief, the Summerses' phone is ringing.
8: 00, on the dot.
Hello? - Do you have the money?
I-I need to speak to my husband.
do you have the money? Did you get access to the account?
I have to know Allan's okay first.
hold on.
Mary? Mary, are you there?
Oh, Allan! Oh, god! Are you all right?
darling, I'm fine.
Oh, Allan!
Mary, everything's gonna be okay.
we worked out a very good way of handling this.
follow this man's instructions, and I'll be home tomorrow night -- trust me.
I love you. I love Adam. I love you both so much.
goodbye, now. - Wait. Allan.
all right, proof of life.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
okay, I am unfreezing the account.
I want the money in two heavy-duty garbage bags -- noon tomorrow.
drop the bags in the trash can on the corner of 5th and grand. Come alone.
no cops. Do not bring your cellphones.
understand? - Yes.
if you fail to follow these instructions, your husband ends up like the guy who picked him up from the airport.
the call's untraceable, chief.
okay, um, we need to notify Mario Gomez's next of kin.
probably in Mexico somewhere.
we don't even know if that's his real name.
could you get on that, please?
chief, Ars. Summers is on the phone.
one second, please. Commander, let's have S.I.S.
continue watching the summerses, and put some extra units on tomorrow's drop.
call detective Sanchez
Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Come on.
what is it, sergeant?
the Summerses' money -- it's gone.
what do you mean, "it's gone"? - Just this second.
I turned back to listen to what you were saying, and when I-I looked back down, - the balance had gone down by-- - how much?
hold on. Checking.
1190476. And 19 cents.
chief, I am so sorry.
well, it's not as bad as it looks.
what are you talking about? The driver is dead.
the kidnapper tricked us into giving him the ransom, or, worse yet, Summers planned this whole thing and we just helped him steal over $1 million.
the FBI's gonna be very upset when I ask them to find out where this money went.
that's if they ever actually answer the phone.
well, it's the FBI's fault, anyway.
they were supposed to be keeping tabs on Summers.
and they gave us permission to unfreeze the account.
come in.
Yes, what is it, sergeant?
I, um...
I traced the bank transfer, and I found out where summers' money is going.
did you get a name?
of... a country.
the, uh, ransom's off to the Cayman islands.
from there, it can be sent anywhere without being traced. That's great.
well, but the good news here is that the money won't be credited to the Cayman Islands account until about 7: 00 A. M. Our time, so we still have a few hours to figure this thing out.
did the FBI give you a copy of the Summers fraud investigation yet?
no, they have not. - Well, they need to hurry those files along.
I want to understand the amount of ransom.
it can't be random. It must mean something.
sergeant. Here.
Congratulations. You're now officially on hold with the FBI.
good luck getting them to hurry.
look, I just want to say that I'm, uh, I'm really sorry about losing the money.
maybe detective Daniels...
could have done a better job.
I don't know about that.
it was a protected account.
Allan Summers was supposedly the only other person besides the bank and the FBI to even have that password.
and Summers knows a great deal about finance.
maybe. But he doesn't know the first thing about blood spatter!
lieutenant Tao?
behind the murder board, chief.
I figured out what happened in Gomez's town car.
is this my desk?
the driver's throat was slashed here, spurting arterial blood.
then the victim leapt over these two rows to here.
he then flew over the headrest...
and shot himself in the head with a vanishing bullet.
you're saying the crime scene was staged?
the blood couldn't have come from any series of wounds.
and there are no smear marks anywhere inside the car.
the body wasn't dragged out of it.
there was no blood outside the car -- not one drop.
so, what do you think happened?
my opinion -- the blood was brought to the car in a container and splashed inside.
though, where anybody got this much of it at once is beyond me.
Mario's regular fare said that when Mario's wife got sick, he became her nurse.
and nurses know how to draw blood.
but this would have taken a lot of elaborate planning, chief.
mario Gomez would have to know he needed this much blood weeks before the kidnapping.
and he also would had to have known Allan Summers.
okay, stop, Buzz.
can you play it back again from when we first see Allan Summers and slow it down this time? - Sure.
okay, freeze it.
you see that, lieutenant?
all the other drivers are holding up their name cards before the passengers come out.
but Mario doesn't lift his until he sees Allan Summers.
but, according to his boss, Mario never drove Allan Summers before.
summers didn't know Mario, but Mario certainly knew him.
so, it's not a murder anymore.
no. Now it's a kidnapping -- again.
so, this illegal immigrant took a job as a driver, then kidnapped Allan Summers the first chance he got, then staged his own death?
after which, he executed an international money-laundering scheme.
it's the amount of the ransom that makes no sense. If I understood that...
chief, I got the FBI's case file on Allan Summers.
Oh, finally.
Yes, finally. And I've been doing a little math.
now, Summers' employees were suing him for $300 million.
now, you subtract $100 million that they agreed to pay their attorneys if they won...
lawyers.
and that leaves us with $200 million.
now, there were 168 litigants.
if they won their case, each employee would have received a payoff of $1, 190, 476. 19.
maybe somebody didn't trust the courts.
excellent work, sergeant.
and do you have the names and addresses of these employees?
everyone who's worked for summers properties, yes, ma'am.
okay, we only have a few hours to find the victim.
look through your files and find me a Latino man who knows something about money, who might have lost his wife, and who looks like this.
mario Gomez is actually Mario Vargas -- born and raised in Los Angeles.
spent the last 20 years as a risk analyst for Allan Summers' company.
he lost everything in the collapse.
his house here is being repossessed.
if this is Vargas' real house, what about the apartment he was renting?
like the driver's license he bought, like the extra cellphone he dumped at the town car, like pretending to be an illegal afraid for his life with the girl he drove back and forth to work.
Vargas does all that so he can get a job as a driver and kidnap Summers?
his wife apparently died of cancer recently.
maybe he was looking for someone to blame.
nice tie you got there.
Really? Well... Thanks.
Yeah, thanks. Uh, what are you looking for?
Vargas has 15 photographs of this house in his kitchen.
yeah?
looks, uh, looks new. No address?
no. Trying to find something that might tell us where it is.
well, good.
what's with you?
haven't slept in two days.
back is sore. My neck is stiff.
I hurt in places I forgot I had.
you're seeing someone.
admit it -- you're dating.
mind your own business,
here, why don't you go find out where this house is while I catch my second wind?
and stop staring at my tie.
so, we mobilize the entire L.A.P.D. to find Summers and pick up this Vargas guy, and neither one of them is here.
Vargas is coming back.
mendoza has eight S.I.S. vehicles on the lookout for his car.
how do we know for sure he's coming back?
the Cayman islands account probably posted the ransom an hour ago.
Where's he headed?
mexico city.
and then someplace without an extradition treaty, I imagine.
chief.
in taking care of his wife, Mr. Vargas probably became quite proficient with a hypodermic.
you do get better as you go along.
he could have been drawing his own blood for months.
saving up enough to throw around inside that car.
chief. Chief, I found a current cellphone bill for Mario Vargas.
and I have Mikki on the line. S.I.S. made Vargas' car.
it's coming this way. No passenger on board.
if Vargas drives up now and sees us here, he's not gonna stop.
tell Mikki we're going with plan "B."
plan "B" -- yes!
Mikki, go with plan "B." I repeat, go with plan "B.
Hello?
mario Vargas? - Yeah. Who's this?
this is deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson of the L.A.P.D.
we were hoping that you could come down to parker center today, our headquarters downtown, and help us with a little problem we're having.
and, uh, what problem is that?
I understand you used to work for Allan Summers.
Yeah, a-a-a year ago. His company went bankrupt.
well, we may have found where Mr. Summers was storing a whole bunch of extra cash, and we were hoping that you and his other employees could help us find it.
I'm afraid I wouldn't be much use in that regard.
I only analyzed the data as Mr. Summers sent it down to our department.
and it was all lies. I really had no idea what he was doing.
well, if it's more convenient, I could stop by your place, save you the trip.
or, if you have a minute now, we could chat on the phone.
uh, now is not a good time for me -- I'm driving.
and... there's really nothing I can do for you, so...
all right, then, sir. Sorry to bother you.
I just have one more teeny-tiny question before I let you go.
okay. What's the question?
sir... are you wearing a seat belt?
what?
get out of the car! Now! Now!
hands where I can see them!
nice work, detective Mendoza.
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson of the L.A.P.D.
and, at the risk of stating the obvious, sir, you are under arrest.
I'll take it from here.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney and to have one present during questioning.
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided to you by the state.
have you heard and understood your rights, Mr. Vargas?
Yes.
do you want a lawyer?
for what?
all right, sir, well, I'm in a terrible hurry.
all you have left to do is tell me where to find Allan Summers.
Why? Is he missing?
sir, we are way beyond the "I don't know what you're talking about" phase of our relationship.
I know exactly what you did and exactly how you did it.
and we will eventually find the computer used to transfer the money from summers' account, which will connect you to the bank in the caymans.
you don't know much about the Cayman Islands, do you, son?
sir, the name of the game here is "leniency,"
which I will do my very best to arrange if you tell me -- right now
where to find Allan Summers.
okay, I'll tell you about Allan Summers.
he took a lot of money that belonged to other people, and what he didn't spend, he lost.
he destroyed thousands of lives and then just... walked away.
Mr. Vargas, you were your company's risk analyst.
what are you saying -- you didn't know what Summers was up to?
that sounds a lot like my last job interview-- and the one before that.
summers was a swindler pretending to be a businessman.
he stole $600 million from people who trusted him.
and what did you do about that? I'll tell you -- nothing.
you never do anything about people like Allan Summers.
you mean people who commit crimes for money?
sounds a lot like you, sir, because from where I'm sitting, you're nothing but a methodical bank robber pretending to be a chauffeur.
in fact, you're worse than Allan Summers.
worse than Summers? - Well, you're the violent one.
I'm violent? He killed my wife.
Oh, come on.
Allan Summers didn't even know you, much less your wife.
how did he kill her?
when we lost our jobs, we lost our healthcare.
my wife got pancreatic cancer.
so your insurance company killed your wife.
I wouldn't have lost my insurance if Allan Summers were a decent human being.
even if he had been a more decent businessman!
I watched as my wife lay suffering and blamed herself!
you want to know what she did?
to save me our last $5, 000...
she killed herself, okay?
she shot herself in the head because she was too expensive to take care of anymore.
she died while she still had a chance to recover.
but what did she have to live for? He took everything. Everything.
so you arrest me, and Allan Summers, you want to rescue. How's that fair?
I don't work for the fairness system, sir.
Allan Summers has done terrible things.
if you tell me where he is, I promise to do my best to get justice for what he took from you.
and how's my wife gonna get that -- justice?
how do you suppose Allan Summers can settle accounts with her?
and is this what your wife would have wanted you to do
take the man who caused all her suffering and yours and the suffering of thousands of others and transform him from a criminal into a victim?
because the longer it takes for us to find Allan Summers, the more sympathetic he becomes.
is that what you want?
okay. You want to know where allan summers is? Fine. I'll tell you.
he's in a hell of his own making.
right.
thank you. Sergeant Gabriel.
this has to be the place.
for once, I'm happy to be renting.
hell of his own making
get us inside, please.
bathroom clear!
found him.
okay, Mr. Vargas. Okay.
a murder.
sorry I'm late.
diet cola, please. Thank you.
so, how'd things go with irene?
sorry, david.
she won't even let me apologize?
David, there are some things an apology just can't change.
well, is she dating someone else?
she's moved on. And so should you.
this thing with irene -- it hurt your career.
you know, it -- it kills me, because...
she gets promoted, and I'm the bad guy. - Yeah.
Sanchez won't talk to me unless he has to.
tao -- he's polite but distant.
and the chief Chief won't confide in me anymore.
so, I don't know, maybe I should take the lieutenant's test. - Nah.
outside of major crimes, lieutenant's an administrative position, just like sergeant.
instead of taking a step up, consider this -- take a step sideways.
add "detective" to your present rank.
and that's something i can help you with.
l. A.P. D. Everyone, stay inside.
stop! Police! Stop now! Police!
show me your hands! Show me your hands!
Where's your gun? What did you do with your weapon?
please, I don't want to die.
you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine.
we got a victim down by the newsstand, and this kid just took a shot at me!
we need to secure the area and find his gun!
hurry up, guys.
you're going to the E. R.With this kid.
I can'T. I can'T. I shot him. I have to wait here. We have to find his gun.
this kid is dying.
if you want time to question him, it's got to be now.
go. Go.
I want every inch of this area taped off.
sergeant davies, make sure those casings over there are marked with our gps system.
that couple over there -- the ones who called 911
they say they saw the murder from their car.
separate them. Get detailed -- and I mean detailed
statements from both of them individually.
uh, captain rehder?
lieutenant flynn, I'm a little busy. What is it?
well, we were wondering if, while you're investigating the shooting of a scumbag suspect, we might be able to look into the actual murder.
chief johnson won't be happy with the evidence just deteriorating
this isn't chief johnson's crime scene, so I wouldn't worry about it, gentlemen.
officer-involved shootings are my jurisdiction, not major crimes'.
that dead body over there is ours.
not tonight.
uh, captain rehder. Maybe it might expedite things if I
if you'd explain why the sergeant who pulled the trigger was permitted to leave the scene after he'd been drinking and while you were with him, which makes you a percipient witness.
what hospital am I going to?
sergeant ray, get the commander's statement and get him out of here.
sergeant elliot, I'm reachable on my cell!
chief. - Sergeant.
you're okay?
uh, yeah, I'm -- I'm -- yes, ma'am. I'm just waiting to hear about, uh...
Erik whitner, the kid I shot. Doesn't look good.
commander taylor told me that you may have had a chance to question this young man -- erik
on your way to the hospital.
getting in the -- in the ambulance, he just kept saying he didn't want to die and no one was supposed to get hurt and...
well, that's an odd thing to say, especially since he was killing people.
what else did he say?
look, chief, um...
I may have made a mistake here.
okay, what was that?
well, I never read the kid his rights, and I talked to him while he was laid out on the stretcher
Oh, no, no, that's okay. That's okay.
that's not a mistake. That's not a mistake.
Erik is probably dying, and dying declarations are admissible in murder trials.
wait. Chief, why are you here instead of the crime scene?
well, unfortunately, david, major crimes isn't allowed to pursue this homicide until after the force investigation division has finished their initial assessment of...
what you did.
what? - Look, look, look, I-I need you to sit down.
okay, I need you to sit down right now and listen to me.
commander taylor deliberately sent F. I.D. To the wrong hospital, but they're gonna figure that out soon enough, so we have maybe minutes before your lawyer shows up and captain rehder steps in.
my lawyer?
I need you to tell me exactly what happened -- exactly what happened.
I -- I heard shots. I-I ran out of the bar.
I saw the victim down by the newsstand.
I looked up, I saw the gunman fleeing.
I identified myself as a police officer, ordered him to stop.
he turned around and opened fire -- two shots.
and I returned fire, and I dropped him.
Erik whitner fired his gun twice?
Yes, twice. - At you? Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure!
okay, F. I.D. Is gonna tell you that there was no gun found at the crime scene and that the only casings were from a 9-millimeter, and I'm certain that that is gonna match up with your gun.
there was a gun, because he shot at me.
but there were no bullet impacts behind where you were standing, and there were no ricochet marks.
as far as F. I.D. Is concerned, you were not fired upon, and you shot an unarmed man.
W-what about the body at the newsstand?
doesn't that prove that there was a gun? - Are you absolutely positive that erik whitner fired at you?
sergeant gabriel, don't answer that.
who are you? - Anthony monroe.
communications division notified the union, and I've been assigned as your attorney in this case.
apologize it took me so long to get here, but there was a mix-up in hospitals.
if we could, I'd like to sit down and talk about tonight's events.
look, mr. Monroe, I didn't do anything wrong, and I don't want an attorney.
Yes, sergeant, you do.
okay. So I have an attorney.
captain rehder.
are you sergeant david gabriel?
Yes, I am.
as a sergeant, I would expect you to be familiar with the rules and regulations surrounding the use of your firearm.
and you would be correct.
then why did you disregard L. A.P. D.Policy and leave the scene of your action?
I was following a direct -- - sergeant, please say nothing else.
I see you've met your counsel, so I won't bother asking you for your statement.
but over here, there is this officer with a breathalyzer, and I would appreciate it if you visited him immediately to assess your blood alcohol level.
or if you prefer, your lawyer can explain to you the long-term consequences of failing to do as I ask.
do you need help with the word "immediately"?
captain rehder, it is so nice to finally meet you.
so, I was told that sergeant gabriel and the victim had been sent to cedars, and here you all are at st. Catherine's medical center.
and I was just wondering, how is it that you happened to be at the right hospital while I was sent to the wrong one?
if I may, I'd like to offer some advice.
when investigating shootings like this, I question the criminals first before my fellow officers.
when I have an unarmed civilian sprayed by bullets from a member of the L. A.P. D.
I expect cooperation. It encourages me.
and if I could offer you some advice
while I am investigating this shooting, be careful where you place your sympathies.
chief. - Excuse me?
be careful where you place your sympathies, chief.
you are a captain and a subordinate officer, and you will remember that when addressing me.
do I make myself clear, captain?
perfectly... chief. Excuse me. Got work to do.
is kitty okay? I thought I heard her throwing up!
no, no.
it's just -- just a little cough.
he's fine. - She's fine.
are you sure?
I could take her in today instead of tomorroW.
no, no, no, no. She ate her whole breakfast.
I don't want to rush her over to the vet.
let's -- let's not make too much of it.
I got to go. - Well...
I'm late. no, I'm late. - I could swear I...
I-I heard -- - I'm late.
let's pause in this report for a moment, commander, to hear why you ignored policy and put sergeant gabriel in an ambulance instead of waiting for the black-and-whites and then sent F. I.D. To the wrong emergency room.
I thought the paramedics were going to cedars. My apologies.
I was off-duty. I had had several alcoholic beverages on an empty stomach.
you didn't seem at all drunk to me, commander.
Thanks.
uh, well, regardless, erik whitner is in stable condition.
sergeant gabriel has met with his counsel and given his statement.
the only thing outstanding is the homicide of a newspaper vendor, which no one has been allowed to investigate.
chief pope, I spent the night familiarizing myself with major crimes
really, really impressive.
I find no incidents where they've investigated the murder of a newspaper vendor, whereas the shooting of an unarmed civilian by an L. A.P. D. Officer incurs serious liability.
well, it can't take priority over homicide.
perhaps captain rehder would like to tell mr. Parsall's family that his murder
chief johnson is trying to combine my officer-involved shooting - with her murder investigation...When they are clearly - I'm sorry, are you interrupting me, captain?
...Two distinctly different cases. I must go first! - Are you interrupting me?
my investigation must go first!
these attempts to pull rank are embarrassing, unacceptable, and potentially an obstruction of justice.
I have a federally mandated responsibility to determine why an L. A.P. D.Officer discharged his weapon, which supersedes chief johnson's objections, as well as yours, sir...
if it comes to that. - It... won'T.
thank you.
were there any witnesses to this shooting?
Yes, a-a couple saw a young white man shoot mr. Parsall several times at point-blank range, empty his cash drawer, and run away.
Erik whitner had $2 in his pocket, he had no gun, he wasn't I. D.'D by the witnesses.
well, then whoever murdered mr. Parsall is still out there.
what if he shoots someone else while captain rehder refuses me access to the crime scene?
is it safe to assume that the white male who shot mr. Parsall was not sergeant gabriel?
that is not the issue here.
then what is the issue, captain?
clearly, chief johnson wants to combine my case with her murder in order to protect a well-liked member of her division.
I will not allow my professional conduct to be questioned like this, especially when all I've asked captain rehder to do is just to move her red tape just a few feet to the left so that I can properly begin searching for a murderer.
all right, captain rehder, you seem to be insisting that this officer-involved shooting and that parsall's murder are two separate events.
that's exactly what they are, and I need to be allowed to work my case - before chief johnson -- - no, no, no.
if erik whitner is not the shooter, than major crimes needs to look for the real killer.
you and chief johnson will share the crime scene and the witnesses.
but sergeant gabriel is not to take part in this investigation until the officer-involved shooting is completely explained.
chief johnson, wait.
I just want to say that I understand the urge to protect the people you work with, and I respect it.
but I'm obligated to investigate this shooting as if it were a criminal act, and I would ask that you do nothing to jeopardize the success of my inquiry, that's all.
you stay out of my way, captain, I'll stay out of yours.
well... I tried.
careful, chief.
she's part of internal affairs, and she can carry a grudge.
well, then... she better get ready for some heavy lifting.
I remember rehder back when she was a sergeant.
filed a complaint against my old partner, george andrews, said he was misogynistic.
we had to look it up.
got both of us four months of sensitivity training.
well, that was a complete waste of time.
doctor, anything?
well, he's definitely dead.
there's also this stippling around each wound -- basically, gunpowder burns.
but they're not spread out, which tells me mr. Parsall was shot at extremely close range.
what's bothering you, though?
usually, when bullets pierce the skin, they tear the epidermis and present a torn edge.
these wounds are clean... round.
the only reason I can think of for this type of entrance wound is that the bullet must have been...
Ah, I'm right. Wadcutters.
target rounds. - Flat tip.
leave clean, round holes in paper so you can tell the exact entrance point.
Yeah, well, finding the exact entrance point -- not a problem we have with this guy.
the average target round is accurate only over short distances.
and because the bullet is flat-tipped, they're not used in magazines or clips.
jams too easily. Which means the murder weapon is probably
a revolver.
which would explain why there were no casings found at the crime scene.
sergeant, please, you're not allowed to be part of this investigation.
Yes, lieutenant?
chief, a revolver would explain why there were no casings at the crime scene.
thank you.
what do we know about the couple who witnessed the shooting?
okay... Well, that was ron and tina drake.
they were sitting in their car by the curb for an hour or so, and they saw the robbery and the murder.
what were they doing in their car for an hour?
well, They're a divorced couple, you know, working things out.
well, good for them. A relationship based on love is -- is worth fighting for.
isn't it?
who are you?
chief, the drakes said they got a good look at the shooter as the robbery started but ducked down in their car right after.
and when they were shown a photo of whitner, they had no idea who he was.
you know what I was thinking, chief?
I mean, what do you get when you rob a newsstand? Like, what, $38 in quarters?
maybe mr. Parsall pissed somebody off.
they killed him, and the robbery was just incidental.
what do we know about mr. Parsall?
well, he immigrated here from israel, uh, in 2000.
he was naturalized in 2004.
besides owning the newsstand, volunteered at a jewish community center twice a week. No record.
so, if it wasn't a robbery, what was it?
uh, chief johnson?
uh, buzz, we're not ready to go to the crime scene yet.
that's fine. I just stepped in to tell you I can't come with you.
what? Why not?
well, the other detectives over there say they never got word from captain rehder to let civilians in.
but you work for us! - I know.
that woman!
never mind, we're all going.
lieutenant tao, would you please bring your bag of tricks?
and, sergeant gabriel, you're coming, too.
you just said I wasn't a part of this investigation.
but you're a witness, and I need witnesses.
what are you doing?
we're headed to the newsstand to pick up a paper, read about the two F. I.D. Guys who got fired because they disregarded orders from the pope.
listen, I'm not gonna -- - tone, tone, tone.
that's no way to talk to a lieutenant, or a deputy chief, for that matter.
sir, if you do anything to interfere with my murder investigation,
I'll see to it that you spend the next month on unpaid leave.
is that understood? Okay, buzz.
buzz, start filming everything over here, including the unhappy officers over there.
s. G." Sergeant gabriel.
stands for "suspect guilty," as far as F. I.D.'S concerned.
okay, so, this is where you said you were standing when you fired your weapon?
uh, lieutenant flynn, would you please play the part of erik whitner?
thank you. All right, sergeant, please return to this mark. Thank yoU.
and, buzz, could you -- buzz?
where is buzz? - Right here.
chief, what are you thinking?
what if there was someone else involved in the shooting of mr. Parsall?
what, like a second gunman?
more like a lone gunman with an accomplice.
Yeah, but, chief, I saw the gun fire from right about where flynn is standing.
in your statement, you said you saw the flash of a gun, not the gun itself.
so, just like I couldn't see buzz standing behind lieutenant flynn just now, it's possible that you didn't see the gunman standing behind erik whitner.
y-yeah, but it couldn't be like that.
I mean, h-how could it be like that?
Syzygy!
Syzygy. It means when three things are in a row, like an eclipse when the earth, the moon, and the sun are in alignment
or, in this case, gabriel, erik whitner...
and someone else.
the divorced couple were sitting in their car for an hour, so, to the shooter and his lookout, this whole area would have appeared deserted.
the lookout, erik, signaled to someone else that the coast was clear.
and if that someone else murdered parsall and then fired at gabriel as he was making his escape, those shots could have looked like they came from erik.
wait. Wait a minute. So what are you saying?
you think I shot an unarmed kid?
there were no bullet impacts behind where sergeant gabriel was standing.
sergeant... would you turn over your firearm, please?
thank you.
and, lieutenant tao, can I have a clip of blanks, please?
mm, here you go, chief. - Thank yoU.
okay, everyone stand behind me, please.
I'm firing a weapon with blanks.
there's no need to be alarmed. There's no need to be alarmed.
sergeant, there's no way you were standing on this mark when you fired your weapon.
Yeah, he would have been standing more near here.
tao. - Yeah.
looks like a wadcutter.
thank you, lieutenant.
sorry to interrupt, gentlemen. Where's erik whitner?
uh, in his room, asleep, I thinK.
his parents and attorney are waiting outside there.
it's not exactly a, uh, police-friendly situation here.
Yeah, ballistics matched thebullet found at the crime scene with the bullets that killed howard parsall.
so whoever killed our victim also fired at sergeant gabriel.
it doesn't prove that this erik kid was involved in the crime, even with what he said in the ambulance.
so it's still david's word against this kid.
I hate to ask y'all this, since I know it's against your nature, but, um, do you think that you could distract erik's parents and his lawyer, sort of irritate them down the hall?
after you.
lieutenant flynn, L. A.P. D.
Yeah, we'd like to talk to you about your son. We have some very important information.
can we just go over here to the waiting room, please? Be a bit more private.
who are you?
I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson of the L. A.P. D.
I'm so sorry to awaken you when you're feeling unwell, but I have a few questions.
I already talked to the other lady.
I know, but I'm here because you may have witnessed the actual murder.
I don't know what you're talking about.
you don't remember another man being shot the night before last?
well, that happens sometimes.
um, the trauma of being wounded can affect your recollections, but the killer ran right past you.
he was as close to you as I am right now.
okay, I don't want you in here anymore. Please leave.
Hey, you can't do that!
dad! Hey, mom!
I'm not gonna talk to you.
that's okay. You can just listen. I got plenty to say.
the officer who rode with you in the ambulance told me you said some things to him on the way to the E. R.
nobody was supposed to get hurt.
I didn't say anything to him. He shot me.
why would I say anything to him?
you'd be amazed at what people say when they think they're about to meet god face-to-face, because they're sorry or guilty or afraid.
I wasn't dying. - You thought you were.
that's the other thing you said -- "please don't let me die." Sound familiar?
no.
Erik, have you ever heard of the term "transferred intent"?
it means that if a homicide occurs during the commission of a felony -- say, armed robbery
that everybody involved is as responsible for the murder as the guy who pulled the trigger, even if they were just a lookout and they didn't see the car with the witnesses sitting at the curb.
I didn't do anything. I was just standing there.
why were you just standing there?
doesn't matter why.
you can't arrest me for anything.
not right now, erik, but I'm coming after you!
I'm gonna prove that you murdered howard parsall, even if I have to use transferred intent to do it.
do you really want to go to the gas chamber because someone else committed a murder?
come on, who was with you the night before last?
who shot mr. Parsall? Who shot at the police?
what are you doing in here? - I'm talking to your son, that's all.
without his lawyer present?
I'm discussing a murder, not your civil case.
either way, this is all going into the lawsuit.
what's with you people? You care more about investigating some dead arab than you do my son.
chief johnsoN. - Ricardo, of course. How are you?
would you gentlemen excuse us just for one moment, please?
you're here about the boy.
cop shooting an unarmed teenager -- that's a big story.
of course, taylor keeps shutting me out, so I figured I'd just come here and see what the boy has to say.
well, if you wait a day -- - it's already been two, chief.
pretty soon, it's gonna be old news. I can't let that happen.
this case may be more than just an officer-involved shooting.
Really? How so?
well, I'm not at liberty to say today...
but look, look, look, look -- I'M... offering you an exclusive.
all right, 24 hours. It better be worth it.
it will.
I want to know everything I can about this erik whitner
where he goes to school, who his friends are, what his activities are.
I'm beginning to think this was a hate crime.
uh, sorry, one second.
Hey, uh, w-what did dr. Fleming say?
Kitty isn't getting better.
what does that mean?
Brenda, there's just...
all right, listen. Honey...
there is nothing else we can do...
except try and keep kitty comfortable, warm.
look, we need to get a second opinion.
now, listen to me.
you really want to put kitty through more needles and tests?
she has been loyal to you and loving in every way, and she has nothing but suffering ahead of her.
she's counting on us to stop that.
but, you know, dr. Fleming said that we could keep her comfortable.
try and keep her comfortable -- try.
look... Do we need to talk about this right now?
no, brenda, we don't have to talk about it now, because you know what needs to be done here.
but I can't do it. I can't do it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
chief johnson? - Yes?
Pope's in the office with rehder.
Oh, that woman! - Chief...
look, if the kid I shot was really unarmed, maybe I should call my attorney and
no, sergeant. Your attorney will say what I'm going to say -- sit tight.
hello.
chief johnson, I told you to investigate a murder, and now you're harassing a witness.
well, he's not a witness anymore. He's a suspect.
are you in possession of evidence I don't have?
I don't know.
okay, let's get this straight here.
I have 72 hours after an L. A.P. D.Officer discharges his firearm to report to the chief of police and the federal government as to the exact nature of the event.
so if you are in possession of evidence that I don't have, it is required that you give it to me for my report.
you can have access to my evidence when I finish investigating the murder.
she isn't just investigating a murder.
she's working very hard to get sergeant gabriel off the hook for shooting my victim, and she's impeding federal justice.
I am the one with the victim!
and you're protecting the suspect from the justice system.
the opposite is true here, actually, chief johnson.
you are protecting sergeant gabriel -- my suspect -- as well as badgering the witness.
how am I doing that?
uh, by threatening erik with the death penalty.
all I did was give an 18-year-old boy some free legal advice.
transferred intent can be a difficult concept to grasp.
your conduct during this murder investigation has begun to seriously threaten a federal inquiry.
look, captain, you were the one who insisted that these were two separate cases.
but, chief johnson, according to erik whitner's attorney, who called me to complain about this harassment, a little sensitivity might be called for.
the whitners recently lost a family member in the war in afghanistan, and now, two weeks later, to have their son shot up by an L. A.P. D.
I'm sorry, what -- what -- who -- who in their family died?
gunnery sergeant william M. Roth -- mrs. Whitner's older brother
marine sharpshooter killed in afghanistan 19 days ago when mortar fire hit his transport vehicle.
so, mr. Parsall's murder could have been revenge for erik's uncle's death in the middle east.
Yeah, but mr. Parsall is from israel.
it isn't always easy to tell who's from where in the middle east.
and where did, uh, gunnery sergeant roth live?
uh, 1066 sylmar avenue, uh, panorama city.
and a search on the roth family address shows a complaint was filed against them by their next-door neighbor.
a complaint -- for what?
uh, shots fired.
turns out gunnery sergeant roth's son, billy, who happens to be erik whitner's cousin, was playing target practice with his neighbor's fence just last week.
Yeah, I regret filing that complaint.
why is that, sir?
I didn't know that billy's dad died in afghanistan a little while ago.
I'm sure the kid was just blowing off some steam.
the fence is old anyway, needs to be replaced.
Ah, I should have let it go.
tao.
you know, I can't get to it without entering the roth property, and there's no one home to ask.
not home. Right.
uh, detective sanchez, why don't you go ahead and give it a try?
sir?
Oh, hey, be my guest.
looks like a wadcutter.
six lands, with a left twist.
I'll have to confirm it with ballistics, but I think we have a match.
lieutenant flynn, I think that buys us a search warrant.
already on it, chief.
okay... now, where are the roths, I wonder?
en route to nebraska.
apparently, the roths booked a family trip to grandma's right after you visited with erik.
Omaha P. D.Is waiting for them at the airport.
how did the tests go on the revolver we found under billy's bed?
matches the bullets.
Plus, sanchez put a picture of billy roth in a six pack, and each witness separately I. D.'D him as the shooter.
uh, ricardo, would you mind?
look, we won't have the kid in our custody for at least another 48 hours.
I can't wait that long. Captain rehder needs to report to the chief tomorrow.
I'm gonna have to get what I need from erik.
chief, I don't think the parents and the lawyer are gonna fall for the same trick twice.
Mr. And mrs. Whitner.
Hi, my name is ricardo ramos.
I work for the times, and I'd like to ask you a few questions, if I could.
we're not giving statements.
Oh, I don't need a statement.
I, uh, need a perspective -- your perspective.
you see, you have a story that needs to be told, and I want to be the one to tell it.
I'll even buy the coffee.
okay. - Great.
Hello, erik.
you're not supposed to be in here.
do you remember that legal term I explained to you -- "transferred intent"?
well, you don't need to worry about it anymore, because I just spoke to your cousin billy.
what are you talking about?
Billy told me that the two of you were just gonna hassle mr. Parsall but that you had other ideas once you got there.
do you recognize this gun? You should.
we've just confirmed it as the weapon used to kill mr. Parsall.
that's... that's not mine. I didn't do anything.
I told you I was coming after you, erik, and here I am.
I have the murder weapon.
I have your cousin's statement saying that you're the shooter, that you fired at the police, and that after you were shot, he grabbed the gun and ran away, which means I have you for homicide.
Erik whitner, you are under arrest for the murder of howard parsall.
you have the right to remain silent. - Okay.
anything you say can be used against you in a court of laW. - Okay, hold on a second.
you have the right to an attorney. - Please?
if you can't afford the attorney you already have... - hold on, please?
one will be provided to you. - Please stop and let me explain!
do you understand and waive your rights?
Yeah, fine, yes. Just let me explain.
what the hell's going on in here?
sir, please stand back. - No, this is my son's room.
your parents can't help you now, erik. Only me. Talk to me.
tell me what happened, or I'm gonna have to go with billy's side of the story, and you can kiss the rest of your life goodbye!
I didn't know about the gun.
I thought we were just gonna kick the guy's ass or steal his money or something.
because he's middle eastern? - Because he's muslim.
because we're at war with the muslims.
but, listen, I didn't know billy was gonna shoot that guy.
I didn't know. I-I just wanted to scare him. I swear. You have to believe me.
Billy is the one who shot him, not me.
and after billy shot mr. Parsall?
he took the money out of the register, and we started to run.
until you heard someone telling you "stop.
I stopped and I turned around and I started to raise my hands.
but billy was standing behind you, and he fired at the officer?
Yes. Yeah, he shot at him, yeah.
how many times? How many times?
twice! I think.
look, nobody was supposed to get hurt.
that's exactly what you said to sergeant gabriel in the ambulance
nobody was supposed to get hurt. - Yeah.
that is what I said. And now look at me.
well, The good news is that the doctors say that you're gonna make a full recovery.
unfortunately, the same can't be said for mr. Parsall.
Oh, and for your information, howard parsall, the arab that your cousin murdered
he wasn't an arab, and he wasn't a muslim.
he was an american citizen... and he was jewish.
you shot the wrong guy.
I didn't shoot anybody! - This is against the law.
you cannot come in here and accost my son!
I'm not accosting your son.
I'm arresting him for murder in the first degree.
lieutenant provenza, would you please do the honors?
Oh, my pleasure, chief.
Ricardo. - I helped you out.
thank you for that. - And we had a deal.
we did.
and I think I know what your exclusive should be, hopefully.
and, hopefully, that will be what?
the headline should read, "L. A.P. D.Sergeant cleared of all charges.
so tell the shrink, if you had the whole thing to do over again, you don't know how you'd do it differently.
say shooting the kid made you upset, but not too upset, 'cause you were being shot at, too, so you're happy to be alive.
say you feel for the kid, even though he participated in a murder.
and they're going to ask you how many nights a week do you drink.
keep it under three.
Yeah. Yeah, that's good.
sergeant gabriel?
will you join us, please?
thank you, commander.
thank you, julio.
so, sergeant gabriel, as you know, erik whitner's cousin billy roth has been arrested for the murder of mr. Parsall and attempted murder of a police officer.
Erik whitner has also been charged with the murder of mr. Parsall, though I fully expect the D. A.To make a deal with him in return for his testimony.
does that comport with your version of events, captain rehder?
it does...
now that I have all the information you withheld.
and is there anything else?
Yeah, there is.
sergeant gabriel, the district attorney has reviewed F. I.D.'S report and, upon our recommendation, is not filing charges against you.
so, once behavioral science has signed off, you are cleared for full duty.
thank you, captain.
you're very welcome.
is that all, chief?
uh, well, I do want to express my appreciation for the insight that you've given me into how F. I.D. Functions.
I have learned a great deal from your single-minded approach.
and i have learned a great deal about your investigative technique, as well, especially as it regards L. A.P. D.'S struggle to regain autonomy over its own affairs, and I'll be including all of that in my final report... chief.
Oh, I can't wait to read that, captain.
sergeant...
do not doubt yourself on this.
you acted properly, legally, and decisively to protect the public safety.
by shooting an unarmed kid.
the law considers him every bit as guilty as the boy holding the gun.
Yeah, well, I understand how the law sees it.
I just, um I see it a little differently.
but I do want to thank you, chief, for being there for me.
well, if I'm going to be upset with you when you're wrong, sergeant, the least I can do is stand up for you when you're right.
I made arrangements for someone to be with kitty during the day, so...
no, no, no, you're right.
I've been thinking about it, and...
I've only been looking at how hard this is on me...
not kitty.
it's not what she deserves.
Dr. Fleming's coming over right now.
and, uh, we're gonna do it here so that her last moments aren't in some examination room.
I just -- I want to do the right thing by her.
this is the right thing, isn't it?
I think it is, sweetie, yeah.
I wish I knew what you were thinking.
but no matter what it seems like we're doing...
it's only because I love you so much.
Oh, my poor little kitty.
my poor, poor, poor, poor little girl.
Fritzy, is that you?
you cooked dinner.
Yes.
things were slow at work, so I
I went to the grocery store and thought I'd cook dinner.
what's in the box you just put in the cupboard?
meatloaf and -- and mashed potatoes?
Yes. I thought you might be tired of clam linguine.
what's in the box?
uh, the vet called.
he wanted to know if I'd stop by and pick up... Kitty's ashes.
you know what, honey? Since the food is hot, - why don't we just sit down and -- - Oh, you know what? This will just take a second.
now, I just want to take a -- a quick look, and
and I see dead bodies all the time. It's not like...
Kitty was cremated, so...
it's okay. It's all right.
they put him in a plastic bag. - her.
they put her in a plastic bag.
this is not ashes, it's chunks!
and this should say "kitty Johnson," not "kitty Howard.
Hey, you know, the vet gave me a brochure. See?
Yeah, they have all these, you know, decorative
no, I don't want to be one of those women - What do you call them?
who puts her cat in an urn on the mantel with a picture and a ribbon and a bell.
I want to find some other way to properly honor kitty.
like spreading her ashes around someplace that was important to her.
where? She was never allowed to go outside.
how is everything?
this meal could not have been better if we'd eaten it hot.
well, thank you.
if nothing happens at work tomorrow, I'll open the grill that my brother sent.
actually, you know, if things are really that slow at work, maybe you could do me a little favor.
no, no, never mind. You're right.
we're keeping our professional lives separate.
well, how little is it? The -- the favor.
small.
we, um... Well, the fbi needs to talk to this guy, Austin Blair, and, uh, we can't locate him, that would be
you know, quietly. Just quietly.
very quietly.
why quietly?
well, we don't want to tip off the whole world we're looking for him.
you're right. That really is a small favor.
what's his name again?
who is Austin Blair?
a 26-year-old single white male.
I found missing persons had a month-old file on him.
and you want major crimes to take over a missing-persons case?
why would you do that?
look, Will, you're the one who's always preaching that we're one department.
look, I - I've been asked to...
keep austin's name under the radar. It's a special request.
special request? What are we, a karaoke bar?
special request from whom, regarding what?
what's wrong? - I just, um...
I just forgot to take kitty out of my purse this morning.
out of... Where is she?
she's... She's here.
I gather she took a turn for the worse.
look, I-If you -- If you don't want me to take this missing-persons case
no. no, no, no. Look. Tell you what.
why don't you just go back to your office, and I'll have commander Taylor go down to missing persons
no, I'm perfectly capable of going down to missing -- - No. no, no, no, no.
you're too, you know -- You're a little too... High-ranking.
and, uh, you said you want to keep this quiet.
I did. Okay, thanks.
uh, don't, uh...
sorry. Thanks.
and this is where it all happens.
uh, this is the -- This is major crimes.
my desk, right here. - Very nice.
Ah, look. There he is.
he looks exactly like you.
Ah, here.
Lauren, I would like you to meet sergeant Gabriel, soon to be detective sergeant Gabriel.
well, I've got to pass the test first, but, wow, it is a pleasure to meet you, lauren.
Oh, and this is my go-to guy.
this is Andy Flynn.
Andy, I have heard so much about you.
Really? Because, to me, you're a complete surprise.
uh, Lauren, would you just excuse me for one second, please?
Ah, commander Taylor, please meet miss Lauren Hines.
chief. Taylor's here with the file you wanted.
uh, lieutenant Flynn, who is that woman with lieutenant Provenza?
his girlfriend.
you are kidding me.
her name is Lauren.
she's a buyer for men's clothes for a high-end department store.
so ends the mystery of the new suits.
Oh, commander taylor, thank you so much for going down to missing persons.
they were anxious to know why the sudden interest in Austin Blair.
I hope not too anxious. What'd you tell them?
I played dumb, which was easy, seeing as how I don't know anything.
apparently, neither does missing persons.
all they have here are dental records and vehicle registrations.
where are the follow-up reports?
uh, there wasn't any need.
if you look, Austin was reported missing by his boyfriend.
Travis Myers, 22, who last saw Austin leaving
gosh -- a month ago for an after-hours dance party.
what does that have to do with the absence of a follow-up report, exactly?
well, gay boy Austin goes out for the night, doesn't come back.
his boyfriend, this Travis kid, comes in mad and wants us to find out who Austin is sleeping with.
it's a familiar pattern, chief.
well, gentlemen, let's see if this convenient stereotype y'all have cooked up to avoid actual police work holds up under closer scrutiny.
lieutenant Flynn, uh, would you please run a master inquiry on Austin Blair?
but, uh, do it quietly. Just...
offline, off the radar, off the grid.
like it never happened, chief. - Thank you.
anybody know why we are looking for this Austin Blair?
because the chief asked us to?
o - oh, chief. Chief, uh, this is, uh... My...
I'm so pleased to meet you. - I'm so glad to meet you, too.
since things were slow, Lauren came by to see how our division works before...
I take her to lunch.
Oh, good. How nice.
so, lauren... How old are you?
detective Sanchez! You never ask a lady how
Oh, excuse us, Lauren.
we kid a lot around here. You know, always teasing each other.
you know, cops.
uh, detective Sanchez, what can you tell me about Austin Blair?
uh, I ran the registration on his mercedes S. U.V. and his name pops up with dope.
brought in twice for questioning but never arrested.
Yeah, well, his credit card's been active all over the place
new York city, Miami, New Orleans, Fort Lauderdale
all within the last year.
but since he went missing a month ago, nothing.
checked his address. Nice place in Silver Lake.
no liens, current on his mortgage.
okay. All right, well, good news
I mean, depending on how you look at it.
that was Dr. Morales. He says he has four matches in the morgue.
Oh, good. All right, then.
uh, sergeant Gabriel, why don't you and I pop over to the burrito room, and the rest of y'all keep poking around about Austin Blair, but on tippy-toe, please.
thank you. - Shall we?
it's funny you're here.
missing persons called earlier looking for bodies dating back
missing persons called?
bye-bye tippy-toe.
Oh, for heaven's sakes. - What was that date again?
uh, 25th of last month.
according to his boyfriend, he went out to a dance club and never came back.
boyfriend? Wait.
26 years old, 25th of last month.
he wasn't just going to a club. He was going to hell-a.
say what? - Hell-a. Get it?
Hell-a," as in "L. A."?
big circuit party!
circuit party?
okay. Gay culture 101.
circuit parties are kind of like gay raves.
they go on for three or four days.
there's like one a month all over the place -- A white party here, a black party there.
hell-a in Los Angeles.
uh, anyway, every year during hell-a week, we get a spike in O. D.S.
most of them get claimed right away, but every once in a while, we have an out-of-towner that hangs out for a while.
Yep. I think we've got your John Doe here.
uh, I mean, special agent Howard. Uh, what a surprise.
deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, this is special agent Jerry Moore.
what are you people doing?
apparently, someone in your missing-persons division called around to find out why your sudden interest in Austin Blair.
I tried to keep it quiet.
Hey, hey, guys, guys.
that's him. That's Austin.
damn it.
Oh, man. Damn it.
well, look at the bright side.
at least he's not missing anymore.
aspirated vomit in the lungs.
typical in an O.D.S
I ordered a tox screen of the common trail mix of drugs -- "x," ghb, meth.
What'd you say, trail mix?
a lot of circuit party boys like to deejay their own high.
x" for dancing, ghb and meth for sex, "k" for the comedown.
in this case, though, it was only ghb and alcohol in the vomit.
most likely died in the alley where he was found.
why do you say that?
hell-a has a medical staff on site.
first thing they prevent is someone drowning in their own vomit.
they plan on treating overdoses?
thank you so much for the, uh, background here. Much appreciated.
the fbi looks forward to your full report.
well, hold on. Is the doctor working for us, or is he working for you?
I work for the county.
this morgue is neutral territory-- Like Switzerland, without the money.
well, the L.A.P.D.Found Austin Blair.
we deserve to know why we were looking for him.
all right, but we need to keep this inside the fbi.
how do you intend to do that?
so, due to a recent crossover with a federal investigation, the bad news is we have to sign these forms and be deputized into the fbi.
and, uh, once we're formally included, they have to tell us what happened to this Austin Blair and why it's apparently our problem.
what's this? - we're joining the fbi.
but it's only temporary, like love.
do we get badges? They have really cool badges.
Lauren, this is, uh -- This is some really top-secret stuff. Very hush-hush.
um, uh, Buzz, would you mind, uh, escorting Lauren into the electronics room while we have our briefing?
not at all. - Thanks.
Oh, and, Buzz...Why don't you, um
why don't you show her one of my old interviews?
sure. How about the one with you and John Wilkes Both?
uh, was Austin's death a murder or an overdose?
sign, and we'll tell you everything we know.
this agreement is binding and shall remain in effect for 48 hours, during which time we expect you all to behave like fbi agents.
I solemnly swear to act as stupid as possible.
okay. Are there any questions?
well, yeah. How did Austin Blair end up dead?
we don't know. - wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait.
we track this guy down, we find the body, and you guys tell us nothing?
I mean, this -- this -- This is our big briefing? - Yeah.
welcome to the fbi, everyone.
right hand in the air, we do not know if Austin's death was a murder or not.
but let's say it was a homicide.
what would you guys do next?
notify his next of kin.
his father's already on his way down here.
sounds good.
thank you for your, uh, cooperation.
uh, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold
am I working with my husband or the fbi? - Yes.
on an overdose or a murder? - Maybe both.
the second we know more, we'll let you know.
so far, I find being an fbi agent very... frustrating.
I am so sorry, sweetheart, but, uh, it looks like I am back on duty.
mm, I understand. It was great to meet your friends.
Really?
okay, you be careful out there.
Oh, tell that to the bad guys.
isn't she beautiful?
Yeah, you should watch how you kiss her. Your gun almost went off.
you have no idea.
Dr. Blair, thank you so much for coming down.
we would have been happy to come to you.
no, I'd rather not have police in my waiting room.
and just so you know, I'm -- I'm not getting Austin another attorney.
if he's still involved with drugs, that's his problem.
all right, then. Why don't you have a seat?
we have a couple questions we'd like to ask you about your son.
my stepson. I adopted Austin when I married his mother.
one good thing about losing my wife -- She didn't live to see what became of him.
why was he arrested?
Oh, we haven't arrested him, sir.
can you tell me the last time you saw or spoke to Austin?
Yeah, about a month ago. Little longer.
I spoke with him on the phone. My god. What happened?
sir, can you tell us why it's been so long since
did you not hear what I asked you? What happened to Austin?
sir, I - I'm sorry to inform you that your stepson passed away over a month ago.
Austin's dead? How?
well, uh, it appears to have been an overdose.
you people.
wait. Can he just
sir? Doctor? Sir?
Dr. Blair, please wait!
I have surgery across town in an hour.
just call me with how I should go about arranging for his funeral.
you may be in shock. - Not even warning me what this was about.
don't talk to me about shock! You don't think I know about shock?
sir, we need to know if Austin had any enemies or anyone who might have had a reason to
you're looking for a why? My god.
drugs don't give you a why.
you want to know about Austin's life?
try talking to that kid that's answering the phone at his house.
you mean his boyfriend?
how should I know who he is?
sit down! Now, what's your name?
Travis. Travis Myers. What's going on?
W - what's going on here? Did you find Austin?
Hey, w-will you put that down? I don't have permission to
we don't need permission, okay? We have a search warrant.
is there anyone else in this house? - No.
do you know where Austin is? H - have you found him? Is he in jail or something?
when's the last time you saw him?
I reported him gone a month ago.
Hey, will you stay away from there? Hey, get out of there.
Y- you can't -- - Sit down.
Hey, Buzz, up here!
lieutenant!
party time!
the fridge is full of these. I brought my test kit.
my guess is ghb.
all right, so we know your boyfriend is doing drugs.
is he selling them, as well? - Will you get out? Get out of my house!
first off, this isnot your house, so you're the one who's getting out.
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me where Austin is.
yeah? Okay. You want to know where he is?
we found your boyfriend in the morgue.
he died a month ago. - What?
all right, all right. We're arresting you for possession... - That's how you tell people?
you bastards! - of a schedule-1 substance...
let go of me! - and the murder of Austin Blair.
uh, yes, chief.
did you find anything?
uh, yeah. We
we found the boyfriend with lots of loose cash and a fridge full of, uh, ghb.
chief, I-I don't think this was just some guy that the fbi wanted to talk to.
why do you say that?
well, Sanchez found a business card.
whose business card?
special agent fritz Howard of the fbi.
Oh, my goodness!
so, the fbi asksyou to find this Austin Blair, who turns out to be a dead drug dealer who has your husband's business card.
so, your fellow fbi agents, i. e.Your squad and me, are wondering if he might have been a government informant, maybe.
if you're asking me if I knew that going in, I did not. Okay?
so... We'll discuss it later.
so, the fbi has an operation that goes south, and they expect us to fix it for them.
you know, maybe you should just not bring your dead pets to work.
Hello? - Are you alone?
no. What do you want?
step into the back hallway.
look, I-I'm gonna figure this out. I promise. I just have to...
excuse me.
what?
why did -- Why didn't you just tell me you were missing an informant?
first of all, we didn't know Austin was missing. He could have just run away.
and looking for him ourselves could have jeopardized a major drug investigation.
look, your team finding him makes it look more... ordinary.
Oh, wonderful. My wildest dreams achieved. We're ordinary.
Hey, look, look, the good news is everything is going very well.
what is "everything"? And how's it going well?
look, ju-- This is what I can tell you.
we caught Austin dealing ghb at a circuit party.
we offered to let him go if he would help us with an investigation I can't talk about.
but then he disappeared.
Disap-- He didn't disappear! He died!
well, granted. It's not ideal, but you have retrieved vital evidence from his house for us.
you have a potential suspect in custody.
suspect in what? Dr. Morales assumed it was an O.D.S.
his stepfather assumed it was an O.D.S. Why shouldn't I?
okay, but let's just pretend Austin's death looks just a little more like murder.
and you found some boy living in his house with lots of drugs and money.
what would you do then?
I would treat the boy like a murder suspect.
well, if that's your instinct...
we found $30, 000 worth of ghb, plus another $80, 000 in cash.
and when missing persons asked you if Austin had a drug or alcohol problem, what did he say, lieutenant?
he said, "not that I know of.
all those drugs, all that money, and you still didn't know that Austin was a drug dealer?
he wasn't a user.
that's not what the autopsy said.
what else, lieutenant?
he said he last saw Austin going out at night.
when asked where, Travis answered,"I'm not sure.
look I was afraid that if you guys knew where he'd gone, then you'd just think he'd been partying and you wouldn't look for him.
but he would have called if he wasn't coming home.
home.
his home, where you sure made yourself comfortable.
living his life, selling his drugs, maybe, spending his money.
I only use it to pay his bills for him.
I have a job of my own, okay?
I'm saving up to go to college out here, establishing my residency.
Oh, I'm not sure I see college in your future.
I - I might be able to find a permanent spot for you in a California facility, though.
look, I was afraid to throw the drugs out be
because I didn't know who might come looking for them or
or who might show up asking for the money.
did you fill out this useless missing-persons report so that you'd look more innocent - when we found Austin's dead body? - No!
in fact, you look guiltier by the second. - What do you want?
what I want is for you to tell me exactly what happened the last night you saw Austin!
start cooperating! - I am cooperating!
I'm cooperating! I'm cooperating! What do you think that I'm doing? god!
would you describe yourself as the jealous type?
did you call the police because you thought that Austin was cheating on you?
in fact, come to think of it, how do we even know that the two of you were a couple?
we were!
then why did he go to an after-hours dance party and leave you at home?
Austin didn't want me with him because...
he said that he had this big meeting with his boss at hell-a, and that just sounded lame.
so, yeah, when he drove off and left me at home, I was jealous.
and when he didn't come home that morning, and when he didn't pick up his cell...
I called to see if there really had been a meeting.
and his boss told me that Austin left the party with somebody else.
so I just didn't know what to believe anymore.
hang on, hang on.
so you're telling me that Austin was an employee of hell-a?
he wasn't just dealing drugs?
dealing drugs was his job.
Austin flew all over the country
everywhere that his boss held a party.
now we're getting somewhere.
now, at all these different parties, Austin flew in with a supply of ghb to sell?
no. You can't take all that "g" on a plane.
those are the rules. - Whose rules?
Peter Benjamin's rules.
he was Austin's boss. - Stop the interview. Stop it.
but she's not done yet. - Buzz, pull the plug.
I don't work for you.
chief Johnson, stop. We have what we need.
FBI rules. You signed an agreement.
wait. Is -- is that what you needed to know?
that's all for now, Travis. Thank you.
can I see him, please?
Austin. Can I see him?
e - excuse me.
if Peter Benjamin had something to do with Austin's death, I should be conducting the interview.
we've invited you to observe.
and do everything the stupid fbi way, without any recorders or cameras.
can I at least take notes?
you know we only have one person taking notes during an interview.
well, I'm perfectly happy with that person being me.
look, do you want noodles or rice?
are you gonna let me ask Peter Benjamin questions or not?
you can participate with follow-ups!
look, this is our very first crack at this guy!
which, which, which? - Rice!
okay.
now, while we eat...
I am moving kitty over here. - No, no, no, no!
I hate this feeling of not knowing everything you know.
and on top of everything that happened to poor kitty...
that is so not gonna work.
fine. One fbi agent to another...
are you using this investigation to get back at me for some reason?
no.
my first loyalty is to you, just like I am sure your first loyalty is to me.
right? Right?
of course it is, yes.
okay, then.
thank you.
okay, I'm gonna show you something, which later, you are gonna have to pretend you are watching for the very first time, okay?
okay.
the night we lost him, Austin Blair was wearing a wire.
this is where the party is just getting started.
now, there's Austin handing off the ghb.
that's the recovery room with the medical staff.
goes on like this until...
Austin wanders into the bathroom.
looks like he's not doing well.
Hey, man. Hey, man, you all right? you all right?
whoa, whoa, come on!
and he just passes out.
so, Mr. Benjamin, that's the end.
now let's start with the beginning.
can you describe your relationship with the deceased -- Austin Blair?
Austin worked for me at different venues across the country, and from what you said earlier, it now seems obvious he was going off dealing drugs on the side.
m - may I follow up?
did you actually see Austin Blair leave the hell-a party on the night he disappeared?
uh, no.
that's odd, because you told Travis Myers that you saw Austin leave with another man.
when I told the kid Austin left with someone, I was speaking more about a...
historical pattern. You know, Austin he never left by himself.
Mr. Benjamin, returning to the party itself...
can -- Can you tell us...
did, um... Did -- did any...
individuals receive medical attention during hell-a?
of course.
we have two recovery rooms staffed specifically for people who, you know, over do it.
would one of those have been Austin Blair?
okay. Now, not to stomp on a dead kid's reputation, but, as we all saw the footage, obviously, Austin was dipping heavily into his own supply.
he crashed in a bathroom.
he was brought to our doctor, put in a recovery position, on his side, to prevent him from choking on whatever might come up, and dehydrated with a saline
and when he got to feeling better, I fired him.
so Austin recovered. - Yes.
and I assume, at some point, he got in his car, and he drove home.
Really? Follow-up, please?
I have three witnesses who state that they saw employees of hell-a drag Austin Blair, unconscious, - out into an alleyway. - Okay, really, this
we never agreed to take questions implicating my client in criminal activities here.
okay, okay, I think we need a break, okay? Agent Johnson?
can we, uh......Convene in the hallway?
Oh, absolutely.
enjoy your bagel, Mr. Benjamin.
do you really have three witnesses who saw Austin Blair being dragged out?
no, of course not. How could I?
Brenda, if the fbi lies in an interview, our case can get thrown out of federal court.
I'm not going to Federal Court.
Yeah, but technically, you are in the FBI!
you're willing to just sit there and let this guy eat bagels and lie up a storm?
well, what would you do differently?
when suspects lie to us, we have to lie back.
for heaven's sakes, Fritzy, if we all stop lying to each other, how will we ever get to the truth?
if you think you can remember some of the stuff Peter Benjamin said in this interview.
I'm pretty sure I can.
well, then say Austindidn't die of an overdose.
what would you do then?
Oh, for heaven's sakes. You want to know what I'd do?
here. I quit the stupid FBI.
and from now on, the L.A.P.D. Regards the death of Austin Blair as a murder!
well, that's what we wanted anyway.
well, then you better just hush up, then, and be grateful!
so, Austin recovered? - Yes.
and I assume, at some point, he got in his car, and he drove home.
Dr. Morales found no puncture wounds on Austin's body, so no i. v. was given to rehydrate.
Peter Benjamin lied.
and according to the tox screen, Austin took 4 grams of ghb over the usual recreational dose.
maybe someone spiked his drink, because they knew that Austin came to hell-a wearing a wire.
and look. Look here. This pocket's been ripped, and the camera lens appears to have been located here where this missing faux pearl button was.
faux what? - Faux. It's french for "fake.
you know, like a faux relationship. - Yeah.
Yeah, l-lieutenant, how many more new suits are you going to buy, sir?
one a day, if that's what it takes.
God, what a bunch of cynical bastards.
all right, everyone, please focus!
Oh, here are the rest of his effects
a belt, wrist band, a watch, set of car keys.
no wire anywhere. And you know, just looking at this stuff, with the ripped shirt pocket, the missing wallet, the O.D.S.
I mean, on the surface, this looks like a guy who got mugged because he was too bombed to find his car and drive home.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
too bombed to drive home.
Peter Benjamin said something about Austin driving off, except he was found in an alley.
so where's his car?
we haven't found his vehicle anywhere.
maybe someone has another set of keys.
Travis, do these look familiar?
Yeah, I think they're Austin's.
do you happen to have a spare set?
no, I drove my own jeep out here.
and austin was nervous about anyone else driving his dad's car.
don't worry, doctor. I'll get it.
Whoo! There. That's better.
Dr. Blair, this is a warrant to search the premises.
uh, sir, perhaps you can explain why your dead son's
I'm sorry -- stepson'scar is in your garage.
why are you doing this?
Why? don't you know, doctor?
drugs don't give you a why.
I can explain why I have his car.
I would love to hear that, sir. - Because it's mine.
I registered it to Austin for insurance reasons.
he was supposed to send me the payments.
when he stopped doing that, I took the car back.
how'd you know where to find it?
I went to his house. - But here's the confusing part, sir.
Austin never made it home from hell-a, and neither did his car, so how did you pick it up at his house?
I don't know. Maybe his "friend" -- What's his name?
Travis. He didn't have the keys.
look, I-I know you're just doing your job, but
but honestly, I've got to be at Cedars by 4: 00, so if we can
they know you're not coming. - We called ahead.
because we've also searched your office. - You what?
where my colleagues found supplies for a professional-grade drug lab.
no, no, no. Whatever you think you've found there has a medical application.
50 liters of gamma butyrolactone?
the main precursor in making ghb?
what exactly is the application for that, medically speaking?
this may be obvious. I -- I care a great deal about my cars.
gamma butyrolactone -- It cleans the chrome wheels and such.
did you know that your wheel cleaner comes from China?
it's chock-full of unique impurities.
we could match the ghb that we found at Austin's house to that which we found in Austin's body and connect it all to what we found at your office.
can you do any of that at the county crime lab?
uh, probably not.
actually, you can't do it anywhere. - She always lie like this?
I hope not.
you ever hear of a man by the name of Peter Benjamin, doctor?
let's see if this jogs your memory.
you were in the drug business with your stepson.
the FBI caught Austin dealing.
they promised they'd go easy on him if he gave them his supplier.
they didn't realize that they were asking him to turn on the man he thought of as his father.
no, no. Hold on, hold-- Hold on a second. Just hold on here.
you are jumping to all sorts of conclusions!
all right, all right, let me make this easy on you, doctor.
the L.A.P. D. Doesn't care about the ghb.
we won't be arresting you for that.
all I care about is finding the person who murdered your stepson.
and then you and I are done.
all right.
all right.
listen, you have to understand just -- Just how much money I lost in the crash.
and you see, Austin, he introduced me to this Peter Benjamin.
first, things went very well, and then the fbi caught Austin dealing.
Austin thought that I-Icould just stop making the ghb, get rid of the equipment, he would feed the feds peter, we would both go free.
that was very naive. - How?
because Peter Benjamin was in much the same place that I was.
his portfolio was in ruins, attendance was down, the party revenue was nothing compared to what he made selling drugs, so when I told him that I wanted out...
well, he grew very angry. He threatened me.
I had no choice but to tell him what was going on and why.
so Austin tried to protectyou, and you went and got him killed?
no. No, no. No.
Peter said, well, he would just fire Austin, make him useless to the FBI.
it wasn't until afterwards, when Peter called me, when he ordered me to come pick up that car, that I
that I found out what really happened.
that's awfully vague, doctor.
that Austin had been killed.
and Peter Benjamin said that I had better keep the ghb coming or the same thing would happen to me, and that is a quote.
listen, you got to believe me.
I'm telling you the truth. I swear.
I believe you.
if you'll, uh, take a moment to write all that down, the L.A.P.D. will be releasing you from custody.
special agent Howard.
Yes, former agent Johnson.
suppose you were running a major dope case and the L.A.P.D.Found your supplier.
what would you normally do under those circumstances?
I'd trade my murderer for your doctor.
on one condition.
Austin's money stays here. - why?
finally gonna repaint this place? - That's my business.
you don't need that cash to close your case.
deal or no deal? - Deal.
and thank you. - You're welcome.
Dr. Blair, it's been a real pleasure.
I'll see you when I see ya.
gentlemen, I expect Peter Benjamin in this building as quickly as humanly possible.
thank you.
you see?
did this not turn outexactly the way I said it would?
what does she want the money for?
Oh, I have no idea.
sergeant.
Ah, special agents Moore and Howard of the FBI.
the doctor... Will see you now.
Dr. Dennis Blair...
you're under arrest for the manufacture and distribution of a class-1 controlled substance, tax evasion, racketeering, and conspiracy to commit murder.
chief? - Yes?
I put, uh, Travis in your office.
thank you.
this is from evidence lock-up. - Thanks.
lieutenant, you look so... different today.
uh, well, it's a... New style.
country gentleman. - I call it Mr. Rogers.
going to be big next year.
well, it's -- It's very becoming.
be nice.
Where's his shirt?
uh, we have to keep that, I'm afraid.
it's part of our murder case against Peter Benjamin.
Oh, okay.
there's one more thing, though.
we can't prove where that money came from.
you were living at his house. For all we know, it's yours.
no. I don't want it.
look, Travis, you no longer have a place to live.
and getting your things out of Austin's house is going to be extremely difficult.
I want Austin... Not this.
it's not disloyal to Austin's memory for you to have this money.
you were saving up to go to college.
let's -- let's have something good come out of all this.
okay?
if I hadn't tried to get your mind off of kitty by asking you for a favor...
and if I hadn't brought kitty to work, Pope never would have handed me that missing-persons case.
he was super-loyal, even in death.
she was super-loyal.
I think she'd be very proud.
so, which one of kitty's baby sitting dvds do you want to watch?
cheetah in the land of the lion" or "birds of the Amazon"?
killing versus mating.
you choose.
F the more than 1, 500 species of birds found in the Amazon basin, none is more loyal than the macaw.
known to mate for life, these beautiful animals fiercely defend their families from any predator, large or small.
Brenda: Fritzy, is that you?
Oh.
you cooked dinner.
Yes.
things were slow at work,
so I -- I went to the grocery store
and thought I'd cook dinner.
what's in the box you just put in the cupboard?
meatloaf and -- and mashed potatoes? Yes.
I thought you might be tired of clam linguini.
what's in the box?
uh, the vet called.
he wanted to know if I'd stop by and pick up...
Kitty's ashes.
you know what, honey?
since the food is hot, why don't we just sit down and
Oh, you know what? This will just take a second.
now, I just want to take a -- a quick look,
and -- and I see dead bodies all the time.
it's not like...
Kitty was cremated, so...
[ whimpering ] Ohh.
Fritz: It's okay. [ sniffles ]
it's all right.
they put him in a plastic bag.
her.
they put her in a plastic bag.
this is not ashes, it's chunks!
and this should say "kitty Johnson,"
not "kitty Howard."
Hey, you know, the vet gave me a brochure.
see? Yeah, they have all these, you know, decorative
what do you call them? No, I don't want to be one of those women who puts her cat in an urn
on the mantel with a [sniffles]
picture and a ribbon and a bell.
I want to find some other way to properly honor kitty.
[ voice breaking ] Like spreading her ashes around someplace that was important to her.
where? She was never allowed to go outside.
how is everything?
this meal could not have been better if we'd eaten it hot.
well, thank you.
if nothing happens at work tomorrow,
I'll open the grill that my brother sent.
actually, you know, if things are really that slow at work,
maybe you could do me a little favor.
Mm.
no, no, never mind. You're right.
we're keeping our professional lives separate.
well, how little is it?
the -- the favor.
small.
we, um...
well, the FBI needs to talk to this guy, Austin Blair,
and, uh, we can't locate him,
that would be -- you know, quietly.
just quietly.
very quietly.
why quietly?
well, we don't want to tip off the whole world
we're looking for him.
hmm.
you're right. That really is a small favor.
what's his name again?
who is Austin Blair?
a 26-year-old single white male.
I found missing persons had a month-old file on him.
and you want major crimes
to take over a missing-persons case?
why would you do that?
look, Will, you're the one who's always preaching
that we're one department.
uh...
look, I-I've been asked to...
keep Austin's name under the radar.
it's a special request.
special request? what are we, a karaoke bar?
special request from whom, regarding what?
what's wrong? [ voice breaking ] I just, um...
I just forgot to take kitty out of my purse this morning.
out of...
where is she?
[ whimpers ] She's...
she's here.
Oh.
I gather she took a turn for the worse.
look, i-if you
if you don't want me to take this missing-persons case
no. No, no, no. Look. [ clears throat ]
tell you what.
why don't you just go back to your office,
and I'll have commander Taylor go down to missing persons
no, I'm perfectly capable of going down to missing -- no, no, no, no.
no. you're too, you know -- you're a little too...
High-ranking.
and, uh, you said you want to keep this quiet.
I did.
okay, thanks. [ sniffles ]
uh, don't, uh...
sorry.
Thanks.
and this is where it all happens.
uh, this is the
this is major crimes.
my desk, right here. Lauren: Very nice.
Ah, look. [ chuckles ]
there he is.
he looks exactly like you. [ chuckles ]
Um...ah, here. [ clears throat ]
Lauren, I would like you to meet sergeant Gabriel, soon to be detective sergeant Gabriel.
well, I've got to pass the test first,
but, wow, it is a pleasure to meet you, Lauren.
[ Chuckles ] Oh, and this is my go-to guy.
Andy, I have heard so much about you. Really?
because, to me, you're a complete surprise.
uh, Lauren, would you just excuse me
for one second, please?
Ah, Commander Taylor, please meet
miss Lauren Hines.
chief. Oh.
Taylor's here with the file you wanted.
uh, Lieutenant Flynn,
who is that woman with Lieutenant Provenza?
his girlfriend.
you are kidding me.
Mnh-mnh. Her name is Lauren.
she's a buyer for men's clothes
for a high-end department store.
so ends the mystery of the new suits.
Oh, Commander Taylor,
thank you so much for going down to missing persons.
they were anxious
to know why the sudden interest in Austin Blair.
I hope not too anxious. What'd you tell them?
I played dumb, which was easy,
seeing as how I don't know anything.
apparently, neither does missing persons.
all they have here are dental records
and vehicle registrations.
where are the follow-up reports?
uh, there wasn't any need.
if you look, Austin was reported missing by his boyfriend.
Travis Myers, 22,
who last saw Austin leaving
gosh -- a month ago
for an after-hours dance party.
what does that have to do with the absence of a follow-up report, exactly?
well, gay boy Austin goes out for the night,
doesn't come back.
his boyfriend, this Travis kid,
comes in mad
and wants us to find out who Austin is sleeping with.
it's a familiar pattern, chief.
well, gentlemen, let's see if this convenient stereotype
y'all have cooked up to avoid actual police work
holds up under closer scrutiny.
lieutenant Flynn,
uh, would you please run a master inquiry
on Austin Blair?
but, uh, do it quietly.
Just...offline, off the radar, off the grid.
like it never happened, Chief.
thank you.
anybody know why we are looking for this Austin Blair?
because the Chief asked us to?
O-oh, Chief.
chief, uh, this is, uh...
my...
I'm so pleased to meet you.
I'm so glad to meet you, too.
since things were slow,
Lauren came by to see how our division works before... I take her to lunch.
Oh, good. how nice. [ chuckles ]
how old are you?
detective Sanchez!
you never ask a lady how
Oh, excuse us, Lauren. [ chuckles ]
we kid a lot around here.
you know, always teasing each other.
you know, cops.
uh, Detective Sanchez,
what can you tell me about Austin Blair?
uh, I ran the registration on his Mercedes S. U. V.
and his name pops up with dope.
brought in twice for questioning but never arrested.
Yeah, well, his credit card's been active
all over the place -- New York city, Miami,
new Orleans, Fort Lauderdale -- all within the last year.
but since he went missing a month ago, nothing.
checked his address. Nice place in silver lake.
no liens,
current on his mortgage.
okay. All right, well, good news
I mean, depending on how you look at it.
that was Dr. Morales.
he says he has four matches in the morgue.
Oh, good. All right, then.
uh, Sergeant Gabriel, why don't you and I
pop over to the burrito room,
and the rest of y'all keep poking around
about Austin Blair,
but on tippy-toe, please.
thank you.
shall we?
it's funny you're here.
missing persons called earlier looking for bodies dating back
missing persons called?
bye-bye tippy-toe.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
what was that date again? - Uh, 25th of last month.
according to his boyfriend,
he went out to a dance club and never came back.
boyfriend?
wait.
26 years old, 25th of last month.
he wasn't just going to a club. He was going to hell-a.
say what?
hell-a.
get it? "hell-a," as in "L. A."?
big circuit party!
circuit party?
Ah. Okay.
gay culture 101.
circuit parties are kind of like gay raves.
they go on for three or four days.
there's like one a month all over the place
a white party here, a black party there.
hell-a in Los Angels.
uh, anyway, every year during hell-a week,
we get a spike in O. D. S.
most of them get claimed right away,
but every once in a while,
we have an out-of-towner that hangs out for a while.
Yep. I think we've got your John Doe here.
uh, I mean, Special Agent Howard.
uh, what a surprise.
deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson,
this is Special Agent Jerry Moore.
what are you people doing?
apparently, someone in your missing-persons division
called around to find out
why your sudden interest in Austin Blair.
I tried to keep it quiet.
Hey, hey, guys, guys.
that's him. That's Austin.
damn it.
Oh, man. Damn it.
well, look at the bright side.
at least he's not missing anymore.
let's see. The guy was spotted in an alley.
aspirated vomit in the lungs.
typical in an o. d.
I ordered a tox screen
of the common trail mix of drugs
"x," GHB, meth.
What'd you say, trail mix?
a lot of circuit party boys like to deejay their own high.
"X" for dancing, GHB and meth for sex, "k" for the comedown.
in this case, though,
it was only GHB and alcohol in the vomit.
hmm.
most likely died in the alley where he was found.
why do you say that?
hell-a has a medical staff on site.
first thing they prevent
is someone drowning in their own vomit.
they plan on treating overdoses?
exactly thank you so much for the, uh, background here.
much appreciated. The FBI looks forward to your full report.
well, hold on. Is the doctor working for us, or is he working for you?
I work for the county.
this morgue is neutral territory
like Switzerland, without the money.
well, the L. A. P. D. found Austin Blair.
we deserve to know why we were looking for him.
all right, but we need to keep this inside the FBI.
how do you intend to do that?
so, due to a recent crossover with a federal investigation,
the bad news is we have to sign these forms
and be deputized into the FBI.
and, uh, once we're formally included,
they have to tell us what happened to this Austin Blair
and why it's apparently our problem.
what's this?
we're joining the FBI.
but it's only temporary, like love.
do we get badges?
they have really cool badges.
Lauren, this is, uh
this is some really top-secret stuff.
very hush-hush.
um, uh, Buzz, would you mind, uh, escorting Lauren
into the electronics room while we have our briefing?
not at all. Thanks.
Oh! Oh, and, Buzz...
why don't you, um
why don't you show her one of my old interviews?
sure. How about the one with you and John Wilkes Booth?
uh, was Austin's death a murder or an overdose?
sign, and we'll tell you everything we know.
this agreement is binding
and shall remain in effect for 48 hours,
during which time we expect you all to behave like FBI agents.
I solemnly swear to act as stupid as possible.
okay.
are there any questions?
well, yeah.
how did Austin Blair end up dead? - We don't know.
wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait.
we track this guy down, we find the body,
and you guys tell us nothing?
I mean, this -- this -- this is our big briefing?
Yeah. Welcome to the FBI, everyone.
right hand in the air,
we do not know if Austin's death was a murder or not.
but let's say it was a homicide.
what would you guys do next?
notify his next of kin.
his father's already on his way down here. - Sounds good.
hmm. thank you for your, uh, cooperation.
uh, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
hold
am I working with my husband or the FBI? - Yes.
on an overdose or a murder? - Maybe both.
the second we know more, we'll let you know.
so far, I find being an FBI agent very...frustrating.
Lauren, I -- I am so sorry, sweetheart,
but, uh, it looks like I am back on duty.
mm, I understand.
it was great to meet your friends.
Really?
okay, you be careful out there.
Oh, tell that to the bad guys.
isn't she beautiful?
Yeah, you should watch how you kiss her.
your gun almost went off.
you have no idea.
Dr. Blair, thank you so much for coming down.
we would have been happy to come to you.
no, I'd rather not have police in my waiting room.
and just so you know, I'm
I'm not getting Austin another attorney.
if he's still involved with drugs,
that's his problem.
all right, then. Why don't you have a seat?
we have a couple questions we'd like to ask you
about your son.
my stepson.
I adopted Austin when I married his mother.
one good thing about losing my wife
she didn't live to see what became of him.
why was he arrested?
Oh, we haven't arrested him, sir.
can you tell me the last time you saw or spoke to Austin?
Yeah, about a month ago.
little longer.
I spoke with him on the phone.
my god. what happened?
sir, can you tell us why it's been so long since
did you not hear what I asked you?
what happened to Austin?
sir, I-I'm sorry to inform you
that your stepson passed away over a month ago.
Austin's dead?
how?
well, uh, it appears to have been an overdose.
you people.
wait. Can he just
Uh...sir?! Doctor?! Sir?!
Dr. Blair, please wait!
I have surgery across town in an hour.
just call me with how I should go about
arranging for his funeral.
you may be in shock. - Not even warning me what this was about.
don't talk to me about shock!
you don't think I know about shock?
sir, we need to know if Austin had any enemies
or anyone who might have had a reason to
you're looking for a why?
my god. Drugs don't give you a why.
you want to know about Austin's life?
try talking to that kid
that's answering the phone at his house.
you mean his boyfriend?
how should I know who he is?
sit down! Now, what's your name?
Travis. Travis Myers. What's going on?
w-what's going on here?
did you find Austin?
Hey, w-will you put that down? I don't have permission to
we don't need permission, okay?
we have a search warrant.
is there anyone else in this house?
no. - Do you know where Austin is?
h-have you found him? Is he in jail or something?
when's the last time you saw him?
I reported him gone a month ago.
Hey, will you stay away from there?!
Hey, get out of there. Y-you can't
sit down.
Hey, Buzz, up here!
lieutenant!
Oh.
party time!
the fridge is full of these. I brought my test kit.
my guess is GHB.
all right, so we know your boyfriend is doing drugs.
is he selling them, as well?
will you get out? get out of my house!
first off, this is not your house,
so you're the one who's getting out.
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me where Austin is.
yeah? Okay.
you want to know where he is?
we found your boyfriend in the morgue.
he died a month ago.
what? - All right, all right.
that's how you tell people?
we're arresting you for possession... - You bastards!
...of a schedule-1 substance... - Let go of me!
...and the murder of Austin Blair.
uh, yes, Chief.
let go of me!
did you find anything?
uh, yeah.
we -- we found the boyfriend with lots of loose cash
and a fridge full of, uh, GHB.
chief, I-I-I don't think this was just some guy
that the FBI wanted to talk to.
why do you say that?
well, Sanchez found a business card.
whose business card?
special Agent Fritz Howard, with the FBI.
Hi. - Oh, my goodness!
so, the FBI asks you to find this Austin Blair,
who turns out to be a dead drug dealer
who has your husband's business card.
so, your fellow FBI agents, i. e. your squad and me,
are wondering if he might have been
a government informant, maybe.
if you're asking me if I knew that going in, I did not.
okay?
so...
we'll discuss it later.
so, the FBI has an operation that goes south, and they expect us to fix it for them.
you know, maybe you should just not bring
your dead pets to work.
Hello?
are you alone? - No.
what do you want?
step into the back hallway.
look, I-I'm gonna figure this out. I promise.
I just have to...
excuse me.
Hi. What?
why did
why didn't you just tell me you were missing an informant?!
first of all, we didn't know Austin was missing.
he could have just run away.
and looking for him ourselves
could have jeopardized a major drug investigation.
look, your team finding him makes it look more...ordinary.
Oh, wonderful. My wildest dreams achieved.
we're ordinary.
Hey, look, look, the good news is
everything is going very well.
what is "everything"? And how's it going well?
look, ju-- this is what I can tell you.
we caught Austin dealing GHB at a circuit party.
we offered to let him go
if he would help us with an investigation
I can't talk about.
but then he disappeared.
Disap-- he didn't disappear!
he died!
well, granted.
it's not ideal, but you have retrieved vital evidence from his house for us.
you have a potential suspect in custody.
suspect in what?
Dr. Morales assumed it was an O. D.
his stepfather assumed it was an O. D.
why shouldn't I?
okay, but let's just pretend Austin's death
looks just a little more like murder.
and you found some boy living in his house
with lots of drugs and money.
what would you do then?
I would treat the boy like a murder suspect.
well, if that's your instinct...
we found $30, 000 worth of GHB,
plus another $80, 000 in cash.
and when missing persons asked you
if Austin had a drug or alcohol problem,
what did he say, Lieutenant?
he said, "not that I know of."
all those drugs, all that money, and you still didn't know that Austin was a drug dealer?
he wasn't a user.
that's not what the autopsy said.
what else, Lieutenant?
he said he last saw Austin going out at night.
when asked where, Travis answered, "I'm not sure."
look [sighs] I was afraid
that if you guys knew where he'd gone,
then you'd just think he'd been partying and you wouldn't look for him.
but he would have called if he wasn't coming home.
home. His home,
where you sure made yourself comfortable.
living his life, selling his drugs, maybe,
spending his money.
I only use it to pay his bills for him.
I have a job of my own, okay?
I'm saving up to go to college out here,
establishing my residency.
Oh, I'm not sure I see college in your future.
I-I might be able to find a permanent spot for you in a California facility, though.
look, I was afraid to throw the drugs out be
because I didn't know who might come looking for them
or -- or who might show up asking for the money.
did you fill out this useless missing-persons report
so that you'd look more innocent
when we found Austin's dead body? - No!
cause YOU DON'T LOOK INNOCENT TO ME.
in fact, you look guiltier by the second. - What do you want?!
what I want is for you to tell me
exactly what happened the last night you saw Austin!
start cooperating! - I am cooperating!
I'm cooperating! I'm cooperating!
what do you think that I'm doing?!
God!
so, Travis...
...would you describe yourself as the jealous type?
did you call the police because you thought that Austin was cheating on you?
in fact, come to think of it, how do we even know that the two of you were a couple? we were!
then why did he go to an after-hours dance party and leave you at home?
Austin didn't want me with him because...
he said that he had this big meeting with his boss at hell-a, and that just sounded lame.
so, yeah,
when he drove off and left me at home, I was jealous.
and when he didn't come home that morning,
and when he didn't pick up his cell...
I called to see if there really had been a meeting.
and his boss told me that Austin left the party
with somebody else.
so I just didn't know what to believe anymore.
hang on, hang on.
so you're telling me that Austin was an employee of hell-a?
he wasn't just dealing drugs?
dealing drugs was his job.
Austin flew all over the country
everywhere that his boss held a party.
now we're getting somewhere.
now, at all these different parties, Austin flew in with a supply
of GHB to sell?
no. You can't take all that "g" on a plane.
those are the rules.
whose rules?
Peter Benjamin's rules.
he was Austin's boss.
stop the interview. Stop it.
but she's not done yet.
buzz, pull the plug.
I don't work for you.
chief Johnson, stop.
we have what we need.
FBI rules.
you signed an agreement.
wait.
is -- is that what you needed to know?
that's all for now, Travis. Thank you.
can I see him, please?
Austin. Can I see him?
E-excuse me.
if Peter Benjamin had something to do with Austin's death, I should be conducting the interview.
we've invited you to observe.
and do everything the stupid FBI way,
without any recorders or cameras.
can I at least take notes?
you know we only have one person taking notes during an interview.
well, I'm perfectly happy with that person being me.
look, do you want noodles or rice?
are you gonna let me ask Peter Benjamin questions or not?
you can participate with follow-ups!
look, this is our very first crack at this guy!
which, which, which? - Rice!
okay.
now, while we eat...
I am moving kitty over here.
no, no, no, no!
I hate this feeling of not knowing everything you know.
and on top of everything
that happened to poor kitty...
that is so not gonna work.
fine.
one FBI agent to another...
...are you using this investigation
to get back at me for some reason?
no.
my first loyalty is to you, just like i am sure your first loyalty is to me.
right?
of course it is, yes.
okay, then.
thank you.
okay, I'm gonna show you something,
which later, you are gonna have to pretend you are watching for the very first time, okay?
okay.
the night we lost him, Austin Blair...
was wearing a wire.
this is where the party is just getting started.
now, there's Austin handing off the GHB.
that's the recovery room with the medical staff.
goes on like this until...
...Austin wanders into the bathroom.
looks like he's not doing well.
Hey, man. Hey, man, you all right?
??? You all right?
[ thud ] whoa, whoa, come on!
and he just passes out.
so, Mr. Benjamin, that's the end.
now let's start with the beginning.
can you describe your relationship with the deceased -- Austin Blair?
Austin worked for me at different venues across the country,
and from what you said earlier, it now seems obvious
he was going off dealing drugs on the side.
m-may I follow up?
did you actually see Austin Blair
leave the hell-a party on the night he disappeared?
uh, no.
that's odd,
because you told Travis Myers the kid you saw Austin leave with another man.
when I told the kid Austin left with someone
I was speaking more about a...historical pattern.
you know, Austin
he never left by himself.
Mr. Benjamin, returning to the party itself...
can -- can you tell us...
did, um...
did -- did any...
individuals receive medical attention during hell-a?
of course.
we have two recovery rooms
staffed specifically for people who, you know, overdo it.
would one of those have been Austin Blair?
okay.
now, not to stomp on a dead kid's reputation,
but, as we all saw the footage,
obviously, Austin was dipping heavily into his own supply.
he crashed in a bathroom.
he was brought to our doctor,
put in a recovery position, on his side,
to prevent him from choking on whatever might come up,
and rehydrated with a saline I. V.
and when he got to feeling better,
I fired him.
so Austin recovered.
Yes.
and I assume, at some point,
he got in his car, and he drove home.
Really? Follow-up, please?
I have three witnesses who state that they saw employees of hell-a drag Austin Blair,
unconscious, out into an alleyway.
okay, really, this -- we never agreed to take questions
implicating my client in criminal activities here.
okay, okay, i think we need a break, okay?
agent Johnson?
can we, uh...
convene in the hallway?
Oh, absolutely.
enjoy your bagel, Mr. Benjamin.
Hey. Hey!
do you really have three witnesses who saw Austin Blair being dragged out?
no, of course not. How could I?
Brenda, if the FBI lies in an interview,
our case can get thrown out of federal court.
I'm not going to federal court.
Yeah, but technically, you are in the FBI!
you're willing to just sit there and let this guy eat bagels and lie up a storm?
well, what would you do differently?
when suspects lie to us, we have to lie back.
for heaven's sakes, Fritzy,
if we all stop lying to each other, how will we ever get to the truth?
if you think you can remember some of the stuff Peter Benjamin said in this interview.
I'm pretty sure I can.
well, then say Austin didn't die of an overdose.
what would you do then?
Oh, for heaven's sakes. You want to know what I'd do?
Ohh!
here. I quit the stupid FBI.
and from now on,
the L. A. P. D. regards the death of Austin Blair as a murder!
well, that's what we wanted anyway.
well, then you better just hush up, then, and be grateful!
Dr. Morales found no puncture wounds on Austin's body,
so no I. V. was given to rehydrate.
Peter Benjamin lied.
and according to the tox screen,
Austin took 4 grams of GHB over the usual recreational dose.
maybe someone spiked his drink,
because they knew that Austin came to hell-a wearing a wire.
and look. Look here.
this pocket's been ripped,
and the camera lens appears to have been located here
where this missing faux pearl button was.
faux what? Faux. It's French for "fake."
you know, like a faux relationship.
Yeah.
Yeah, L-Lieutenant,
how many more new suits are you going to buy, sir?
one a day, if that's what it takes.
God, what a bunch of cynical bastards.
all right, everyone, please focus!
Oh, here are the rest of his effects
a belt, wrist band, a watch,
set of car keys.
no wire anywhere.
and you know, just looking at this stuff,
with the ripped shirt pocket, the missing wallet, the O. D.
I mean, on the surface, this looks like a guy
who got mugged because he was too bombed to find his car and drive home.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
too bombed to drive home.
Peter Benjamin said something about Austin driving off,
except he was found in an alley.
so where's his car?
we haven't found his vehicle anywhere.
maybe someone has another set of keys.
Travis, do these look familiar?
Yeah, I think they're Austin's.
do you happen to have a spare set?
no, I drove my own jeep out here.
and Austin was nervous about anyone else driving his dad's car.
don't worry, doctor. I'll get it.
Whoo! There. That's better.
Dr. Blair, this is a warrant to search the premises.
uh, sir, perhaps you can explain why your dead son's
I'm sorry -- stepson's car is in your garage.
why are you doing this?
Why?
don't you know, doctor?
drugs don't give you a why.
I can explain why I have his car.
I would love to hear that, sir.
because it's mine.
I registered it to Austin for insurance reasons.
he was supposed to send me the payments.
when he stopped doing that,
I took the car back.
how'd you know where to find it?
I went to his house.
but here's the confusing part, sir.
Austin never made it home
from hell-a, and neither did his car, so how did you pick it up at his house?
I don't know.
maybe his "friend" -- what's his name?
Travis. He didn't have the keys.
look, i-i know you're just doing your job,
but -- but honestly,
I've got to be at cedars by 4: 00, so if we can
they know you're not coming.
we called ahead.
because we've also searched your office.
you what? Where my colleagues found supplies for a professional-grade drug lab.
no, no, no.
whatever you think you've found there
has a medical application.
50 liters of gamma butyrolactone?
the main precursor in making GHB?
what exactly is the application for that,
medically speaking? - This may be obvious.
I -- I care a great deal about my cars.
gamma butyrolactone
it cleans the chrome wheels and such.
did you know that your wheel cleaner comes from China?
it's chock-full of unique impurities.
we could match the GHB that we found at Austin's house to that which we found in Austin's body and connect it all to what we found at your office.
can you do any of that at the county crime lab?
uh, probably not.
actually, you can't do it anywhere.
she always lie like this?
I hope not.
you ever hear of a man by the name of Peter Benjamin, doc?
let's see if this jogs your memory.
you were in the drug business with your stepson.
the FBI caught Austin dealing.
they promised they'd go easy on him if he gave them his supplier.
they didn't realize that they were asking him
to turn on the man he thought of as his father.
no, no. Hold on, hold
hold on a second. Just hold on here.
you are jumping to all sorts of conclusions!
all right, all right, let me make this easy on you, doctor.
the L. A. P. D. doesn't care about the GHB.
we won't be arresting you for that.
all I care about is finding the person
who murdered your stepson.
and then you and I are done.
all right.
all right.
listen, you have to understand just
just how much money I lost in the crash.
and you see, Austin,
he introduced me to this Peter Benjamin.
first, thing well,
and then the FBI caught Austin dealing.
Austin thought that I-I-I could just stop making the GHB,
get rid of the equipment, he would feed the feds Peter, we would both go free.
that was very naive.
how?
because Peter Benjamin was in much the same place that I was.
his portfolio was in ruins, attendance was down,
the party revenue was nothing
compared to what he made selling drugs,
so when I told him that i wanted out...
well, he grew very angry.
he threatened me.
I had no choice but to tell him what was going on and why.
so Austin tried to protect you,
and you went and got him killed?
no. No, no. No.
Peter said, well, he would just fire Austin,
make him useless to the FBI.
it wasn't until afterwards, when Peter called me, when he ordered me to come pick up that car,
that I
that I found out what really happened.
that's awfully vague, doctor.
that Austin had been killed.
and Peter Benjamin said
that I had better keep the GHB coming
or the same thing would happen to me,
and that is a quote.
listen, you got to believe me.
I'm telling you the truth.
I swear.
I believe you.
the L. A. P. D. will be releasing you from custody.
special Agent Howard.
Yes, former Agent Johnson.
suppose you were running a major dope case
and the L. A. P. D. found your supplier.
what would you normally do under those circumstances?
I'd trade my murderer for your doctor.
on one condition.
Austin's money stays here.
Why?
finally gonna repaint this place?
that's my business.
you don't need that cash to close your case.
deal or no deal?
deal.
and thank you.
you're welcome.
Dr. Blair, it's been a real pleasure.
I'll see you when I see ya.
gentlemen, I expect Peter Benjamin in this building
as quickly as humanly possible.
thank you.
you see?
did this not turn out exactly the way I said it would?
hmm. What does she want the money for?
Oh, I have no idea.
sergeant.
Ah, Special Agents Moore and Howard of the FBI.
the doctor...
will see you now.
Dr. Dennis Blair...
you're under arrest for the manufacture and distribution of a class-1 controlled substance, tax evasion, racketeering, and conspiracy to commit murder.
chief?
yes?
I put, uh, Travis in your office.
Oh. Thank you.
this is from evidence lock-up.
Thanks.
Oh, um... Lieutenant, you look so...
different today.
uh, well, it's a...
new style.
country gentleman.
I call it "Mr. Rogers."
going to be big next year.
well, it's
it's very becoming.
be nice.
Where's his shirt?
uh, we have to keep that, I'm afraid.
it's part of our murder case against Peter Benjamin.
Oh, okay.
there's one more thing, though.
we can't prove where that money came from.
you were living at his house. For all we know, it's yours.
no. I don't want it.
look, Travis, you no longer have a place to live.
and getting your things out of Austin's house
is going to be extremely difficult.
I want Austin...
not this.
it's not disloyal to Austin's memory for you to have this money.
you were saving up to go to college.
let's -- let's have something good come out of all this.
okay?
if I hadn't tried to get your mind off of kitty
by asking you for a favor...
and if I hadn't brought kitty to work,
Pope never would have handed me that missing-persons case.
he was super-loyal, even in death.
she was super-loyal.
I think she'd be very proud.
so, which one of kitty's babysitting DVDs
do you want to watch?
cheetah in the land of the lion
or "birds of the Amazon"?
killing versus mating.
you choose.
Fritzy, is that you?
you cooked dinner.
Yes.
things were slow at work, so I
I went to the grocery store and thought I'd cook dinner.
what's in the box you just put in the cupboard?
meatloaf and -- and mashed potatoes?
Yes. I thought you might be tired of clam linguine.
what's in the box?
uh, the vet called.
he wanted to know if I'd stop by and pick up... Kitty's ashes.
you know what, honey? Since the food is hot, - why don't we just sit down and -- - Oh, you know what? This will just take a second.
now, I just want to take a -- a quick look, and
and I see dead bodies all the time. It's not like...
Kitty was cremated, so...
it's okay. It's all right.
they put him in a plastic bag. - her.
they put her in a plastic bag.
this is not ashes, it's chunks!
and this should say "kitty Johnson," not "kitty Howard.
Hey, you know, the vet gave me a brochure. See?
Yeah, they have all these, you know, decorative
no, I don't want to be one of those women - What do you call them?
who puts her cat in an urn on the mantel with a picture and a ribbon and a bell.
I want to find some other way to properly honor kitty.
like spreading her ashes around someplace that was important to her.
where? She was never allowed to go outside.
how is everything?
this meal could not have been better if we'd eaten it hot.
well, thank you.
if nothing happens at work tomorrow, I'll open the grill that my brother sent.
actually, you know, if things are really that slow at work, maybe you could do me a little favor.
no, no, never mind. You're right.
we're keeping our professional lives separate.
well, how little is it? The -- the favor.
small.
we, um... Well, the fbi needs to talk to this guy, Austin Blair, and, uh, we can't locate him, that would be
you know, quietly. Just quietly.
very quietly.
why quietly?
well, we don't want to tip off the whole world we're looking for him.
you're right. That really is a small favor.
what's his name again?
who is Austin Blair?
a 26-year-old single white male.
I found missing persons had a month-old file on him.
and you want major crimes to take over a missing-persons case?
why would you do that?
look, Will, you're the one who's always preaching that we're one department.
look, I - I've been asked to...
keep austin's name under the radar. It's a special request.
special request? What are we, a karaoke bar?
special request from whom, regarding what?
what's wrong? - I just, um...
I just forgot to take kitty out of my purse this morning.
out of... Where is she?
she's... She's here.
I gather she took a turn for the worse.
look, I-If you -- If you don't want me to take this missing-persons case
no. no, no, no. Look. Tell you what.
why don't you just go back to your office, and I'll have commander Taylor go down to missing persons
no, I'm perfectly capable of going down to missing -- - No. no, no, no, no.
you're too, you know -- You're a little too... High-ranking.
and, uh, you said you want to keep this quiet.
I did. Okay, thanks.
uh, don't, uh...
sorry. Thanks.
and this is where it all happens.
uh, this is the -- This is major crimes.
my desk, right here. - Very nice.
Ah, look. There he is.
he looks exactly like you.
Ah, here.
Lauren, I would like you to meet sergeant Gabriel, soon to be detective sergeant Gabriel.
well, I've got to pass the test first, but, wow, it is a pleasure to meet you, lauren.
Oh, and this is my go-to guy.
this is Andy Flynn.
Andy, I have heard so much about you.
Really? Because, to me, you're a complete surprise.
uh, Lauren, would you just excuse me for one second, please?
Ah, commander Taylor, please meet miss Lauren Hines.
chief. Taylor's here with the file you wanted.
uh, lieutenant Flynn, who is that woman with lieutenant Provenza?
his girlfriend.
you are kidding me.
her name is Lauren.
she's a buyer for men's clothes for a high-end department store.
so ends the mystery of the new suits.
Oh, commander taylor, thank you so much for going down to missing persons.
they were anxious to know why the sudden interest in Austin Blair.
I hope not too anxious. What'd you tell them?
I played dumb, which was easy, seeing as how I don't know anything.
apparently, neither does missing persons.
all they have here are dental records and vehicle registrations.
where are the follow-up reports?
uh, there wasn't any need.
if you look, Austin was reported missing by his boyfriend.
Travis Myers, 22, who last saw Austin leaving
gosh -- a month ago for an after-hours dance party.
what does that have to do with the absence of a follow-up report, exactly?
well, gay boy Austin goes out for the night, doesn't come back.
his boyfriend, this Travis kid, comes in mad and wants us to find out who Austin is sleeping with.
it's a familiar pattern, chief.
well, gentlemen, let's see if this convenient stereotype y'all have cooked up to avoid actual police work holds up under closer scrutiny.
lieutenant Flynn, uh, would you please run a master inquiry on Austin Blair?
but, uh, do it quietly. Just...
offline, off the radar, off the grid.
like it never happened, chief. - Thank you.
anybody know why we are looking for this Austin Blair?
because the chief asked us to?
o - oh, chief. Chief, uh, this is, uh... My...
I'm so pleased to meet you. - I'm so glad to meet you, too.
since things were slow, Lauren came by to see how our division works before...
I take her to lunch.
Oh, good. How nice.
so, lauren... How old are you?
detective Sanchez! You never ask a lady how
Oh, excuse us, Lauren.
we kid a lot around here. You know, always teasing each other.
you know, cops.
uh, detective Sanchez, what can you tell me about Austin Blair?
uh, I ran the registration on his mercedes S. U.V. and his name pops up with dope.
brought in twice for questioning but never arrested.
Yeah, well, his credit card's been active all over the place
new York city, Miami, New Orleans, Fort Lauderdale
all within the last year.
but since he went missing a month ago, nothing.
checked his address. Nice place in Silver Lake.
no liens, current on his mortgage.
okay. All right, well, good news
I mean, depending on how you look at it.
that was Dr. Morales. He says he has four matches in the morgue.
Oh, good. All right, then.
uh, sergeant Gabriel, why don't you and I pop over to the burrito room, and the rest of y'all keep poking around about Austin Blair, but on tippy-toe, please.
thank you. - Shall we?
it's funny you're here.
missing persons called earlier looking for bodies dating back
missing persons called?
bye-bye tippy-toe.
Oh, for heaven's sakes. - What was that date again?
uh, 25th of last month.
according to his boyfriend, he went out to a dance club and never came back.
boyfriend? Wait.
26 years old, 25th of last month.
he wasn't just going to a club. He was going to hell-a.
say what? - Hell-a. Get it?
Hell-a," as in "L. A."?
big circuit party!
circuit party?
okay. Gay culture 101.
circuit parties are kind of like gay raves.
they go on for three or four days.
there's like one a month all over the place -- A white party here, a black party there.
hell-a in Los Angeles.
uh, anyway, every year during hell-a week, we get a spike in O. D.S.
most of them get claimed right away, but every once in a while, we have an out-of-towner that hangs out for a while.
Yep. I think we've got your John Doe here.
uh, I mean, special agent Howard. Uh, what a surprise.
deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, this is special agent Jerry Moore.
what are you people doing?
apparently, someone in your missing-persons division called around to find out why your sudden interest in Austin Blair.
I tried to keep it quiet.
Hey, hey, guys, guys.
that's him. That's Austin.
damn it.
Oh, man. Damn it.
well, look at the bright side.
at least he's not missing anymore.
aspirated vomit in the lungs.
typical in an O.D.S
I ordered a tox screen of the common trail mix of drugs -- "x," ghb, meth.
What'd you say, trail mix?
a lot of circuit party boys like to deejay their own high.
x" for dancing, ghb and meth for sex, "k" for the comedown.
in this case, though, it was only ghb and alcohol in the vomit.
most likely died in the alley where he was found.
why do you say that?
hell-a has a medical staff on site.
first thing they prevent is someone drowning in their own vomit.
they plan on treating overdoses?
thank you so much for the, uh, background here. Much appreciated.
the fbi looks forward to your full report.
well, hold on. Is the doctor working for us, or is he working for you?
I work for the county.
this morgue is neutral territory-- Like Switzerland, without the money.
well, the L.A.P.D.Found Austin Blair.
we deserve to know why we were looking for him.
all right, but we need to keep this inside the fbi.
how do you intend to do that?
so, due to a recent crossover with a federal investigation, the bad news is we have to sign these forms and be deputized into the fbi.
and, uh, once we're formally included, they have to tell us what happened to this Austin Blair and why it's apparently our problem.
what's this? - we're joining the fbi.
but it's only temporary, like love.
do we get badges? They have really cool badges.
Lauren, this is, uh -- This is some really top-secret stuff. Very hush-hush.
um, uh, Buzz, would you mind, uh, escorting Lauren into the electronics room while we have our briefing?
not at all. - Thanks.
Oh, and, Buzz...Why don't you, um
why don't you show her one of my old interviews?
sure. How about the one with you and John Wilkes Both?
uh, was Austin's death a murder or an overdose?
sign, and we'll tell you everything we know.
this agreement is binding and shall remain in effect for 48 hours, during which time we expect you all to behave like fbi agents.
I solemnly swear to act as stupid as possible.
okay. Are there any questions?
well, yeah. How did Austin Blair end up dead?
we don't know. - wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait.
we track this guy down, we find the body, and you guys tell us nothing?
I mean, this -- this -- This is our big briefing? - Yeah.
welcome to the fbi, everyone.
right hand in the air, we do not know if Austin's death was a murder or not.
but let's say it was a homicide.
what would you guys do next?
notify his next of kin.
his father's already on his way down here.
sounds good.
thank you for your, uh, cooperation.
uh, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold
am I working with my husband or the fbi? - Yes.
on an overdose or a murder? - Maybe both.
the second we know more, we'll let you know.
so far, I find being an fbi agent very... frustrating.
I am so sorry, sweetheart, but, uh, it looks like I am back on duty.
mm, I understand. It was great to meet your friends.
Really?
okay, you be careful out there.
Oh, tell that to the bad guys.
isn't she beautiful?
Yeah, you should watch how you kiss her. Your gun almost went off.
you have no idea.
Dr. Blair, thank you so much for coming down.
we would have been happy to come to you.
no, I'd rather not have police in my waiting room.
and just so you know, I'm -- I'm not getting Austin another attorney.
if he's still involved with drugs, that's his problem.
all right, then. Why don't you have a seat?
we have a couple questions we'd like to ask you about your son.
my stepson. I adopted Austin when I married his mother.
one good thing about losing my wife -- She didn't live to see what became of him.
why was he arrested?
Oh, we haven't arrested him, sir.
can you tell me the last time you saw or spoke to Austin?
Yeah, about a month ago. Little longer.
I spoke with him on the phone. My god. What happened?
sir, can you tell us why it's been so long since
did you not hear what I asked you? What happened to Austin?
sir, I - I'm sorry to inform you that your stepson passed away over a month ago.
Austin's dead? How?
well, uh, it appears to have been an overdose.
you people.
wait. Can he just
sir? Doctor? Sir?
Dr. Blair, please wait!
I have surgery across town in an hour.
just call me with how I should go about arranging for his funeral.
you may be in shock. - Not even warning me what this was about.
don't talk to me about shock! You don't think I know about shock?
sir, we need to know if Austin had any enemies or anyone who might have had a reason to
you're looking for a why? My god.
drugs don't give you a why.
you want to know about Austin's life?
try talking to that kid that's answering the phone at his house.
you mean his boyfriend?
how should I know who he is?
sit down! Now, what's your name?
Travis. Travis Myers. What's going on?
W - what's going on here? Did you find Austin?
Hey, w-will you put that down? I don't have permission to
we don't need permission, okay? We have a search warrant.
is there anyone else in this house? - No.
do you know where Austin is? H - have you found him? Is he in jail or something?
when's the last time you saw him?
I reported him gone a month ago.
Hey, will you stay away from there? Hey, get out of there.
Y- you can't -- - Sit down.
Hey, Buzz, up here!
lieutenant!
party time!
the fridge is full of these. I brought my test kit.
my guess is ghb.
all right, so we know your boyfriend is doing drugs.
is he selling them, as well? - Will you get out? Get out of my house!
first off, this isnot your house, so you're the one who's getting out.
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me where Austin is.
yeah? Okay. You want to know where he is?
we found your boyfriend in the morgue.
he died a month ago. - What?
all right, all right. We're arresting you for possession... - That's how you tell people?
you bastards! - of a schedule-1 substance...
let go of me! - and the murder of Austin Blair.
uh, yes, chief.
did you find anything?
uh, yeah. We
we found the boyfriend with lots of loose cash and a fridge full of, uh, ghb.
chief, I-I don't think this was just some guy that the fbi wanted to talk to.
why do you say that?
well, Sanchez found a business card.
whose business card?
special agent fritz Howard of the fbi.
Oh, my goodness!
so, the fbi asksyou to find this Austin Blair, who turns out to be a dead drug dealer who has your husband's business card.
so, your fellow fbi agents, i. e.Your squad and me, are wondering if he might have been a government informant, maybe.
if you're asking me if I knew that going in, I did not. Okay?
so... We'll discuss it later.
so, the fbi has an operation that goes south, and they expect us to fix it for them.
you know, maybe you should just not bring your dead pets to work.
Hello? - Are you alone?
no. What do you want?
step into the back hallway.
look, I-I'm gonna figure this out. I promise. I just have to...
excuse me.
what?
why did -- Why didn't you just tell me you were missing an informant?
first of all, we didn't know Austin was missing. He could have just run away.
and looking for him ourselves could have jeopardized a major drug investigation.
look, your team finding him makes it look more... ordinary.
Oh, wonderful. My wildest dreams achieved. We're ordinary.
Hey, look, look, the good news is everything is going very well.
what is "everything"? And how's it going well?
look, ju-- This is what I can tell you.
we caught Austin dealing ghb at a circuit party.
we offered to let him go if he would help us with an investigation I can't talk about.
but then he disappeared.
Disap-- He didn't disappear! He died!
well, granted. It's not ideal, but you have retrieved vital evidence from his house for us.
you have a potential suspect in custody.
suspect in what? Dr. Morales assumed it was an O.D.S.
his stepfather assumed it was an O.D.S. Why shouldn't I?
okay, but let's just pretend Austin's death looks just a little more like murder.
and you found some boy living in his house with lots of drugs and money.
what would you do then?
I would treat the boy like a murder suspect.
well, if that's your instinct...
we found $30, 000 worth of ghb, plus another $80, 000 in cash.
and when missing persons asked you if Austin had a drug or alcohol problem, what did he say, lieutenant?
he said, "not that I know of.
all those drugs, all that money, and you still didn't know that Austin was a drug dealer?
he wasn't a user.
that's not what the autopsy said.
what else, lieutenant?
he said he last saw Austin going out at night.
when asked where, Travis answered,"I'm not sure.
look I was afraid that if you guys knew where he'd gone, then you'd just think he'd been partying and you wouldn't look for him.
but he would have called if he wasn't coming home.
home.
his home, where you sure made yourself comfortable.
living his life, selling his drugs, maybe, spending his money.
I only use it to pay his bills for him.
I have a job of my own, okay?
I'm saving up to go to college out here, establishing my residency.
Oh, I'm not sure I see college in your future.
I - I might be able to find a permanent spot for you in a California facility, though.
look, I was afraid to throw the drugs out be
because I didn't know who might come looking for them or
or who might show up asking for the money.
did you fill out this useless missing-persons report so that you'd look more innocent - when we found Austin's dead body? - No!
in fact, you look guiltier by the second. - What do you want?
what I want is for you to tell me exactly what happened the last night you saw Austin!
start cooperating! - I am cooperating!
I'm cooperating! I'm cooperating! What do you think that I'm doing? god!
would you describe yourself as the jealous type?
did you call the police because you thought that Austin was cheating on you?
in fact, come to think of it, how do we even know that the two of you were a couple?
we were!
then why did he go to an after-hours dance party and leave you at home?
Austin didn't want me with him because...
he said that he had this big meeting with his boss at hell-a, and that just sounded lame.
so, yeah, when he drove off and left me at home, I was jealous.
and when he didn't come home that morning, and when he didn't pick up his cell...
I called to see if there really had been a meeting.
and his boss told me that Austin left the party with somebody else.
so I just didn't know what to believe anymore.
hang on, hang on.
so you're telling me that Austin was an employee of hell-a?
he wasn't just dealing drugs?
dealing drugs was his job.
Austin flew all over the country
everywhere that his boss held a party.
now we're getting somewhere.
now, at all these different parties, Austin flew in with a supply of ghb to sell?
no. You can't take all that "g" on a plane.
those are the rules. - Whose rules?
Peter Benjamin's rules.
he was Austin's boss. - Stop the interview. Stop it.
but she's not done yet. - Buzz, pull the plug.
I don't work for you.
chief Johnson, stop. We have what we need.
FBI rules. You signed an agreement.
wait. Is -- is that what you needed to know?
that's all for now, Travis. Thank you.
can I see him, please?
Austin. Can I see him?
e - excuse me.
if Peter Benjamin had something to do with Austin's death, I should be conducting the interview.
we've invited you to observe.
and do everything the stupid fbi way, without any recorders or cameras.
can I at least take notes?
you know we only have one person taking notes during an interview.
well, I'm perfectly happy with that person being me.
look, do you want noodles or rice?
are you gonna let me ask Peter Benjamin questions or not?
you can participate with follow-ups!
look, this is our very first crack at this guy!
which, which, which? - Rice!
okay.
now, while we eat...
I am moving kitty over here. - No, no, no, no!
I hate this feeling of not knowing everything you know.
and on top of everything that happened to poor kitty...
that is so not gonna work.
fine. One fbi agent to another...
are you using this investigation to get back at me for some reason?
no.
my first loyalty is to you, just like I am sure your first loyalty is to me.
right? Right?
of course it is, yes.
okay, then.
thank you.
okay, I'm gonna show you something, which later, you are gonna have to pretend you are watching for the very first time, okay?
okay.
the night we lost him, Austin Blair was wearing a wire.
this is where the party is just getting started.
now, there's Austin handing off the ghb.
that's the recovery room with the medical staff.
goes on like this until...
Austin wanders into the bathroom.
looks like he's not doing well.
Hey, man. Hey, man, you all right? you all right?
whoa, whoa, come on!
and he just passes out.
so, Mr. Benjamin, that's the end.
now let's start with the beginning.
can you describe your relationship with the deceased -- Austin Blair?
Austin worked for me at different venues across the country, and from what you said earlier, it now seems obvious he was going off dealing drugs on the side.
m - may I follow up?
did you actually see Austin Blair leave the hell-a party on the night he disappeared?
uh, no.
that's odd, because you told Travis Myers that you saw Austin leave with another man.
when I told the kid Austin left with someone, I was speaking more about a...
historical pattern. You know, Austin he never left by himself.
Mr. Benjamin, returning to the party itself...
can -- Can you tell us...
did, um... Did -- did any...
individuals receive medical attention during hell-a?
of course.
we have two recovery rooms staffed specifically for people who, you know, over do it.
would one of those have been Austin Blair?
okay. Now, not to stomp on a dead kid's reputation, but, as we all saw the footage, obviously, Austin was dipping heavily into his own supply.
he crashed in a bathroom.
he was brought to our doctor, put in a recovery position, on his side, to prevent him from choking on whatever might come up, and dehydrated with a saline
and when he got to feeling better, I fired him.
so Austin recovered. - Yes.
and I assume, at some point, he got in his car, and he drove home.
Really? Follow-up, please?
I have three witnesses who state that they saw employees of hell-a drag Austin Blair, unconscious, - out into an alleyway. - Okay, really, this
we never agreed to take questions implicating my client in criminal activities here.
okay, okay, I think we need a break, okay? Agent Johnson?
can we, uh......Convene in the hallway?
Oh, absolutely.
enjoy your bagel, Mr. Benjamin.
do you really have three witnesses who saw Austin Blair being dragged out?
no, of course not. How could I?
Brenda, if the fbi lies in an interview, our case can get thrown out of federal court.
I'm not going to Federal Court.
Yeah, but technically, you are in the FBI!
you're willing to just sit there and let this guy eat bagels and lie up a storm?
well, what would you do differently?
when suspects lie to us, we have to lie back.
for heaven's sakes, Fritzy, if we all stop lying to each other, how will we ever get to the truth?
if you think you can remember some of the stuff Peter Benjamin said in this interview.
I'm pretty sure I can.
well, then say Austindidn't die of an overdose.
what would you do then?
Oh, for heaven's sakes. You want to know what I'd do?
here. I quit the stupid FBI.
and from now on, the L.A.P.D. Regards the death of Austin Blair as a murder!
well, that's what we wanted anyway.
well, then you better just hush up, then, and be grateful!
so, Austin recovered? - Yes.
and I assume, at some point, he got in his car, and he drove home.
Dr. Morales found no puncture wounds on Austin's body, so no i. v. was given to rehydrate.
Peter Benjamin lied.
and according to the tox screen, Austin took 4 grams of ghb over the usual recreational dose.
maybe someone spiked his drink, because they knew that Austin came to hell-a wearing a wire.
and look. Look here. This pocket's been ripped, and the camera lens appears to have been located here where this missing faux pearl button was.
faux what? - Faux. It's french for "fake.
you know, like a faux relationship. - Yeah.
Yeah, l-lieutenant, how many more new suits are you going to buy, sir?
one a day, if that's what it takes.
God, what a bunch of cynical bastards.
all right, everyone, please focus!
Oh, here are the rest of his effects
a belt, wrist band, a watch, set of car keys.
no wire anywhere. And you know, just looking at this stuff, with the ripped shirt pocket, the missing wallet, the O.D.S.
I mean, on the surface, this looks like a guy who got mugged because he was too bombed to find his car and drive home.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
too bombed to drive home.
Peter Benjamin said something about Austin driving off, except he was found in an alley.
so where's his car?
we haven't found his vehicle anywhere.
maybe someone has another set of keys.
Travis, do these look familiar?
Yeah, I think they're Austin's.
do you happen to have a spare set?
no, I drove my own jeep out here.
and austin was nervous about anyone else driving his dad's car.
don't worry, doctor. I'll get it.
Whoo! There. That's better.
Dr. Blair, this is a warrant to search the premises.
uh, sir, perhaps you can explain why your dead son's
I'm sorry -- stepson'scar is in your garage.
why are you doing this?
Why? don't you know, doctor?
drugs don't give you a why.
I can explain why I have his car.
I would love to hear that, sir. - Because it's mine.
I registered it to Austin for insurance reasons.
he was supposed to send me the payments.
when he stopped doing that, I took the car back.
how'd you know where to find it?
I went to his house. - But here's the confusing part, sir.
Austin never made it home from hell-a, and neither did his car, so how did you pick it up at his house?
I don't know. Maybe his "friend" -- What's his name?
Travis. He didn't have the keys.
look, I-I know you're just doing your job, but
but honestly, I've got to be at Cedars by 4: 00, so if we can
they know you're not coming. - We called ahead.
because we've also searched your office. - You what?
where my colleagues found supplies for a professional-grade drug lab.
no, no, no. Whatever you think you've found there has a medical application.
50 liters of gamma butyrolactone?
the main precursor in making ghb?
what exactly is the application for that, medically speaking?
this may be obvious. I -- I care a great deal about my cars.
gamma butyrolactone -- It cleans the chrome wheels and such.
did you know that your wheel cleaner comes from China?
it's chock-full of unique impurities.
we could match the ghb that we found at Austin's house to that which we found in Austin's body and connect it all to what we found at your office.
can you do any of that at the county crime lab?
uh, probably not.
actually, you can't do it anywhere. - She always lie like this?
I hope not.
you ever hear of a man by the name of Peter Benjamin, doctor?
let's see if this jogs your memory.
you were in the drug business with your stepson.
the FBI caught Austin dealing.
they promised they'd go easy on him if he gave them his supplier.
they didn't realize that they were asking him to turn on the man he thought of as his father.
no, no. Hold on, hold-- Hold on a second. Just hold on here.
you are jumping to all sorts of conclusions!
all right, all right, let me make this easy on you, doctor.
the L.A.P. D. Doesn't care about the ghb.
we won't be arresting you for that.
all I care about is finding the person who murdered your stepson.
and then you and I are done.
all right.
all right.
listen, you have to understand just -- Just how much money I lost in the crash.
and you see, Austin, he introduced me to this Peter Benjamin.
first, things went very well, and then the fbi caught Austin dealing.
Austin thought that I-Icould just stop making the ghb, get rid of the equipment, he would feed the feds peter, we would both go free.
that was very naive. - How?
because Peter Benjamin was in much the same place that I was.
his portfolio was in ruins, attendance was down, the party revenue was nothing compared to what he made selling drugs, so when I told him that I wanted out...
well, he grew very angry. He threatened me.
I had no choice but to tell him what was going on and why.
so Austin tried to protectyou, and you went and got him killed?
no. No, no. No.
Peter said, well, he would just fire Austin, make him useless to the FBI.
it wasn't until afterwards, when Peter called me, when he ordered me to come pick up that car, that I
that I found out what really happened.
that's awfully vague, doctor.
that Austin had been killed.
and Peter Benjamin said that I had better keep the ghb coming or the same thing would happen to me, and that is a quote.
listen, you got to believe me.
I'm telling you the truth. I swear.
I believe you.
if you'll, uh, take a moment to write all that down, the L.A.P.D. will be releasing you from custody.
special agent Howard.
Yes, former agent Johnson.
suppose you were running a major dope case and the L.A.P.D.Found your supplier.
what would you normally do under those circumstances?
I'd trade my murderer for your doctor.
on one condition.
Austin's money stays here. - why?
finally gonna repaint this place? - That's my business.
you don't need that cash to close your case.
deal or no deal? - Deal.
and thank you. - You're welcome.
Dr. Blair, it's been a real pleasure.
I'll see you when I see ya.
gentlemen, I expect Peter Benjamin in this building as quickly as humanly possible.
thank you.
you see?
did this not turn outexactly the way I said it would?
what does she want the money for?
Oh, I have no idea.
sergeant.
Ah, special agents Moore and Howard of the FBI.
the doctor... Will see you now.
Dr. Dennis Blair...
you're under arrest for the manufacture and distribution of a class-1 controlled substance, tax evasion, racketeering, and conspiracy to commit murder.
chief? - Yes?
I put, uh, Travis in your office.
thank you.
this is from evidence lock-up. - Thanks.
lieutenant, you look so... different today.
uh, well, it's a... New style.
country gentleman. - I call it Mr. Rogers.
going to be big next year.
well, it's -- It's very becoming.
be nice.
Where's his shirt?
uh, we have to keep that, I'm afraid.
it's part of our murder case against Peter Benjamin.
Oh, okay.
there's one more thing, though.
we can't prove where that money came from.
you were living at his house. For all we know, it's yours.
no. I don't want it.
look, Travis, you no longer have a place to live.
and getting your things out of Austin's house is going to be extremely difficult.
I want Austin... Not this.
it's not disloyal to Austin's memory for you to have this money.
you were saving up to go to college.
let's -- let's have something good come out of all this.
okay?
if I hadn't tried to get your mind off of kitty by asking you for a favor...
and if I hadn't brought kitty to work, Pope never would have handed me that missing-persons case.
he was super-loyal, even in death.
she was super-loyal.
I think she'd be very proud.
so, which one of kitty's baby sitting dvds do you want to watch?
cheetah in the land of the lion" or "birds of the Amazon"?
killing versus mating.
you choose.
F the more than 1, 500 species of birds found in the Amazon basin, none is more loyal than the macaw.
known to mate for life, these beautiful animals fiercely defend their families from any predator, large or small.
look at our freeways this morning trouble in the city area, southbound 405 ...
disabled tractor trailer off to the right hand side ...
can we just
no, no. Careful! - It's okay.
you know, we don't have to do this today.
No! No, no. These -- these things could be used by other cats.
good morning, sergeant Gabriel.
morning, chief. We just landed a body at the crenshaw community center.
Oh, no. Isn't that father Jack's place?
Yeah. You want me to come by and pick you up or give you directions or
I know where it is.
uh, no, no. I'll, um -- I'll be right there.
doesn't look like much.
maybe I'll wait, then.
chief's here. Appreciate it.
chief, agent Howard, sorry to cut into your weekend.
our, uh, victim is a 35-year-old male, black.
single gun shot to the back of the head.
was discovered around 7: 00 A. M.This morning.
take a guess who found him.
father Jack.
victim's name is, uh, Reginald Gray.
he did maintenance work for the community center, but he's paid by father Jack's church, which is where he was living.
this is a major crime because...
the community center's city-owned, which immediately makes it our problem.
Where's S. I.D?
I told them not to come, chief. - Why?
there's nothing for them to do. Victim was shot once.
there's no casings, no weapon, no witnesses.
and father Jack over there says that the victim, Reggie Gray
who's still on parole, by the way -- is some kind of like ex-con turned saint.
actually, what the father said is that reggie had no known enemies and was well-liked in the neighborhood, lieutenant.
yeah? Well, he doesn't look very popular to me.
Ricardo, this is father Jack.
nice to meet you, father Jack. I'm Ricardo Ramos. - Be right back.
I got a few questions for you.
why is commander Taylor forever bringing that reporter around?
morning, chief.
I know how it looks, but chief Pope believes if ramos is getting father Jack's side, then he should get ours, too.
well, I don't know what our side is yet.
look, just -- just keep him away from me as long as possible, please.
all right.
haven't touched a thing, chief.
called the coroner and gave me a one-hour E. T.A.
but it looks like Reggie here's been dead for quite a while.
why is he damp?
sprinklers off every night at 10: 00.
so he must have been murdered before that.
neighbors didn't hear gun fire.
around here, they never do.
look, I-I-I can't go anywhere until the body's taken away.
why don't I take kitty's things down to the shelter, save you the trip down?
no, no. We should do it together.
you finish your simple investigation.
I'll dispose of kitty's earthly effects.
okay. Thanks.
looks like he's got a wallet in his back pocket, so it wasn't a robbery.
well, if it wasn't a robbery, why else would someone want to kill him?
you want an alphabetical list? - Fire away.
a," ass hole. "B," because. "C," criminal.
excuse me, lieutenant?
do you always begin a murder investigation by assassinating the victim's character?
actually, father, what lieutenant Flynn here meant to say is how sad it is that we're always meeting up again under such tragic circumstances.
any reason why someone might want to see this man dead?
no, none at all.
and I'm not just saying that because reggie worked for me.
Reggie was dedicating his life to improving this community.
do you see that wall there?
Reggie painted over the graffiti on it constantly with supplies he bought himself.
and he mentored several middle schoolers, keeping them out of gangs!
Yeah, that's right, lieutenant. That's the kind of wretched human being he was.
I understand that Reggie lived in your church.
we're gonna have to search through his room.
do you have a warrant?
well, no, but since he's a parolee, we can search through his quarters anytime we like.
Oh, no, no, no. Now, wait a minute. No.
you're allowed to search his quarters when Reggie was alive.
now he's dead.
is he Reggie Gray? - Excuse me?
uh, commander Taylor's point, father, is until the coroner arrives, we can't remove the victim's wallet and check his driver's license.
officially, we don't know who this man is.
I just identified him for you! He worked for me!
I'm afraid that doesn't work as an official identification.
well, I'm -- I'm a little confused, because his name tag says Reggie.
well, if there's one thing you've taught me, Ricardo, it's don't believe everything you read.
I-I tell you what -- while we're sorting through the legal ins and outs of searching the victim's room, uh, commander Taylor, if you could please take a walk through the community center.
it's city-owned, so we don't need a search warrant.
just make sure that nothing's broken into or missing.
well, I need to be present for that. - Fine.
feel welcome to join me, father.
Ricardo, you too. You too.
still got that parole officer's number on speed dial?
sure do, chief. - All right.
uh, lieutenant Provenza, when the parole officer arrives, would you and lieutenant Flynn please supervise the search of Reggie's room?
sergeant Gabriel, would you handle the notification of the victim's family?
thank you. And, uh, detective Sanchez, what else do I need to know about this neighborhood?
Oh, thank you.
okay.
so, what do we have here?
it's gang central L. A. Chief.
there's big overlap out there of black, brown, and a little white.
there's three regular gangs and then one made up of all the gang rejects.
that's what we call "affirmative-action gangsters.
okay. And, uh, who does what?
well, over there... Dope.
over there... Weapons.
and over there, chief... Car theft.
over there... More dope.
gang, gang, gang, gang.
so I'm guessing Reggie's death had something to do with gangs, which is why no one in the neighborhood will talk to us.
and Reggie's room at the church?
Oh, outreach pamphlets, handyman books, a blessed mother statue.
now, father Jack was right about one thing.
Reggie painted over some graffiti three times last month, including yesterday.
so you can bet some gangsters were pretty unhappy about that.
there's a new sandblast technique for removing a single layer of paint.
want me to order it up?
I think we should, lieutenant.
you know, the last time we dealt with him, everyone said that father Jack's place was off-limits to gangs.
Yeah, it still is, but Reggie's older. He did time.
maybe he made some enemies we don't know about, chief.
sergeant Gabriel, how did the notification go?
well, Reggie's mother was devastated, but, um, she confirms what father Jack said that Reggie had turned his life around, no problems with anyone.
then how did he end up dead?
did commander Taylor notice anything missing at the community center?
father Jack said that there was nothing out of place.
and Reggie's known associates from his gang years are all dead and buried.
so every cloud does have a silver lining.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I-I applied for this federal grant to upgrade our surveillance equipment, and I think I got it, but I-I need help translating this letter.
what language is it in?
uh, government. - Ah, yeah. Here, Buzz. I read government.
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
da, da, da, here it is -- for new surveillance and communications equipment, you have on account...
70000 - Really?
Oh, my god.
now, why would the feds give you that kind of money?
well, I promised to spend it really fast, and I can.
speaking of fast, chief, the morgue has a prelim ready.
the bullet entered the soft tissue right below the skull.
but for a . 32 caliber, didn't penetrate very deeply.
.32 caliber's a semiautomatic -- would have kicked out a casing at the crime scene.
we didn't find one.
it may be a professional hit, and they grabbed the casing and took it with them.
what else do you know?
our victim is a former gang member out on parole, and I've got a priest who thinks he's a saint.
well, I don't know about saint, but he meets the first big requirement for martyrdom.
and he was having this tattoo removed.
maybe somebody felt insulted by that.
because when I see this type of injury, we're talking execution.
but no stippling, no sooting, which means the shooter wasn't very close when he fired.
Hey, doc, what if the, uh -- what if the shooter stood like 20, 30 yards away, like, you know, from across the street?
with a . 32? That'd be a hell of a shot, sergeant.
what if the gun malfunctioned or the bullet was a half load?
Oh, well, um, a bad primer could account for some of this.
but honestly, the bullet doesn't tell me much.
well, it's got to tell us something, doctor.
look, w-we'll take it to ballistics.
Hey, uh, chief, the people in that neighborhood know something. They always do.
why don't we set up a meeting at the community center and see if they can help us find the gun?
we talk to them directly.
you want me to share information with civilians? - Yes.
absolutely not! I'm not doing that, ever.
just as well, really.
Why's that?
you don't have any information to share.
so, you chose my day off to execute an illegal search of father Jack's church?
there was nothing illegal about it.
a parole officer visited the victim's quarters.
we only went along to make sure it all went smoothly.
come on, Brenda. Are you deliberately trying to antagonize this guy?
he is deliberately antagonizing me!
I am looking for a killer, and, as usual, father Jack has been uncooperative every step of the way.
what am I supposed to do about that?
well, for starters, you can help me calm his holiness, even if it means you have to behave like a nun to do it.
it's bad enough the L. A.P. D.Won't respect our outreach program to these children and gangs, but when one of our own becomes a target and we're being treated like suspects, that's another thing altogether!
we don't need more suspicion. We need answers.
we're searching for those answers.
in my church and without a warrant and without responding to any of our questions.
we just got this case six hours ago.
we can't pluck witnesses and guns out of thin air.
miracles like that fall more under your jurisdiction than mine, father.
all right, look, we are all after the same thing here.
and what makes you say that? - Well...
you want to find Reggie Gray's killer, don't you?
of course I do!
but how do I know the L. A.P. D.Isn't using his murder to start another witch hunt in my parish?
let's bring your community together. We'll talk to them directly.
Seriously? - Absolutely.
you'd be willing to speak with my people in an open dialogue?
Oh, I don't think a community meeting is really a good idea.
that is a fantastic idea.
we can tell the people what we know, and they could do the same for us.
it'll show the community how seriously we're taking this crime.
well, I have to warn you.
my community feels abandoned.
they're angry about Reggie's death, and trust me, they won't go easy on you.
we can take it, father. Try us.
police see the same things day in and day out!
people getting shot, getting their cars stolen, drugs sold on the corner!
now, why can't the police stop that?
I understand your frustration.
we came here specifically tonight to find ways that we might help each other put an end to that.
I saw you guys taking paint off the wall outside.
do you think some gang members shot Reggie for covering up their graffiti?
we checked into that, ma'am, and that was done by a local tagger, not a gang member.
but like all of you, we are trying very hard to figure out why this happened to Mr. Gray.
a-a-and anything that you know about the shooting last night, even the smallest detail, could help us.
uh, chief Johnson, have you narrowed down any possible motives yet?
no, uh, but thank you for asking that, because I'm especially interested in motives.
sometimes knowing why someone was shot can take us a very, very long way into figuring out who
so, somebody got murdered, and you want us to figure it out?
how do we know we'll even be protected if we tell you anything?
you can't even protect this community center anymore!
I bet this has something to do with Reggie's stint in prison.
No! No, it didn't!
my son, Reggie -- he paid his debt.
he straightened out his life.
he didn't deserve this!
he was trying to make something better for hisself, to make up for all the wrong he did, with humility...
and love... and hard work!
and if we can't turn this place around with spirit like that...
then one of you is gonna be sitting where I am tomorrow...
or next week... or next year!
mourning the loss of your only child...
how many children do we have to bury before this ends, huh?
when is this going to end?
when?
the police don't care.
no. No, sir, we do. We care very much. That's why we're here.
Yeah, you say that, but last night, we had another run-in at the central food and gas mart down the street.
I mean, someone started shooting at people, and the police just drove through and left.
uh, uh, sir, many times, if there's no one there when the officers arrive, they move on to their next call.
you tell us to call when people put up graffiti.
and then we go back and paint over it, someone else comes back, does it all over again.
uh, would you please call buzz and, uh, and send everyone over to this gas station, check it out for signs of a possible shooting, and see if there was a radio call or a report made about it?
Thanks. - Yes, ma'am.
miss, why don't you tell them about the crimes that you are seeing?
what crimes can we talk about with a guarantee of protection? Have you thought about that?
ma'am, I assure you, the entire force is doing everything we can to keep your neighborhood safe.
I won't even take my family out at night anymore.
we're afraid to go out after dark.
and that should not be the case.
so tonight, we have two of the officers here who patrol your neighborhood.
standing there at the back after the meeting, feel free to address any specific concerns you may have with them.
did you guys find anything yet? - Not yet.
buzz. Over here.
I think I found something.
.32 caliber.
we got three more over here.
you want to get this, Buzz?
two in here, and you got one down here.
lieutenant tao...
do you still carry around those geeky lasers?
I-I promise we're gonna do everything we can to find out why this happened.
I hope so, chief Johnson.
and not just for my sake.
people here need to believe in you.
they need to know you're going to do something.
they need to see it.
please.
Yeah.
chief. - Yes.
I just talked to Flynn.
no report was filed on any shooting last night at that food and gas mart, but there was a 911 reported from their phone.
caller said shots were fired. Patrol car was sent.
no one was there, so they kept going. Now, get this.
Flynn says they just found some . 32 casings in their parking lot.
okay. - You need to be shaking hands with people.
not you, lieutenant.
uh, I need to run out just for one quick minute.
no, no, no, no, chief Johnson, you're not going anywhere right now.
there's some casings
you cannot invite these people here to meet you a-and then just leave.
chief, why don't you just -- you stay here and press the flesh, and I'll keep you posted on anything going on.
here we go.
Hey, Julio. We're ready.
okay. Flynn, are you in position?
I'm at the community center.
okay. Are you ready to film this? - All set.
okay, lieutenant tao, point it away from your body like a gun and go to your left towards Flynn at the community center.
okay. Good. Keep going. Good. Good.
tao, Julio, are you guys still there? I don't see anything yet.
Tao... lower it just a little.
Oh, I see it now.
it's hitting me, and I'm right where Reggie was standing.
tao, I see a direct path for the bullet that killed Reggie Gray.
looks like he was shot in somebody else's gunfight.
what kind of sense does that make?
I mean, come on.
sure is quiet in here.
doesn't have to be this quiet, you know?
we could use this bedroom for something other than your unsolved cases.
after last night, this room may not be big enough for my unsolved cases, honestly.
but it could hold a kid.
we could turn this room into a nursery in just a few months maybe.
you should have seen my victim's mother last night.
she stood up and talked about how much she loved her son.
she never gave up on him through prison and parole.
she was helping him turn his life around.
and then one night...
he was shot dead, probably by a-a random bullet, for no better reason than he was just standing in the wrong place at the wrong time.
when I know how easily these things happen,
how can I even think about having children?
the same way E. R.Doctors do...
and undertakers....and soldiers.
and you could ask the same question about getting married.
how many times have you stepped up to some poor woman to say her husband isn't coming home?
and we still said "I do.
that I couldn't help.
you're so great at imaging the worst.
that's part of why you're good at your job.
but try, just... for a minute...
imagining something better.
911. What's your emergency?
Yeah. These guys are in a parking lot, fighting.
someone just fired a gun.
hold on, sir. What's your name?
Tommy Martinez. - What's your location, Tommy?
20th and Crenshaw -- the central food and gas mart.
okay, Tommy, I'm going to dispatch a unit to your location.
stay on the line, please.
wait, wait, wait. I think they're leaving.
Hello? Are you still there?
I'm still here. The patrol car is coming.
that was very brave of you to make that call, Tommy, so thank you for that.
what else can you tell me about that night?
the boys in the parking lot...
how many were there?
I don't remember.
do you remember who fired the gun?
I didn't see anything. I just heard shots.
were they older than you? Younger?
listen, lady, the only reason I took this job is so I could save up money for college.
that call I made -- that's just 'cause there was kids around.
so why don't you leave me alone?
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
I wouldn't be asking you these questions if it wasn't a matter of life and death for someone.
life and death.
okay, look...
I saw a guy with a nice Cadillac, screaming at some other guys to get away from it. That's it.
did they threaten him or try to shoot him?
no, no, no. The guy in -- in the car -- he's the one who fired the gun.
I thought you said you didn't see that.
all right.
I'll tell you about the guy in the car that -- that shot his gun.
but I'm not gonna say anything to you about those gangsters.
if they knew that I was sitting here talking to you, they'd come after me.
come on, man. You know. Tell her.
what gang?
N. D.S. Two of them.
I don't know their names, but, uh, I recognized their faces from the neighborhood.
N. D.S are the 19th street destroyers.
it's the affirmative-action gang I was telling you about.
um, they have a big chop-shop operation, mostly high-end car parts.
you recognized these boys?
okay. How about this -- what color was the Cadillac?
look, Tommy, I understand that growing up in your neighborhood, you must get really good at imagining how bad things can be.
but... try...
just for a minute, to imagine something better.
because that's what we're trying to do -- make a safer place for you and your family.
you can make a difference. You can.
how about this instead?
I wrote down the license-plate number of the Cadillac.
you -- you wrote down the license-plate number, and -- and you didn't show it to the police?
I never had a chance.
by the time you guys got there, everyone was gone.
cops just... rolled through. They didn't even stop.
don't look so surprised, lady.
see, that's the way you always do us.
his name is Kelvin Blake.
registered owner of the vehicle. Age 38.
he lives over on Arlington, about a mile and a half from the service station.
honestly, chief, seems like a nice guy.
who has a rap sheet, even though it's from 20 years ago.
still -- drugs, petty theft.
he works as a foreman for M&fFconstruction company now.
employed there for the last 10 years.
so at least kelvin can hold down a job, and he turned in his gun voluntarily.
thank you. - Ballistics finished their report.
the bullet that killed Reggie came from that gun.
still doesn't prove he pulled the trigger.
chief Johnson... - yes.
I spoke to my robbery guys.
there's been a string of high-end carjackings recently within a few miles of father Jack's community center.
I bet mostly with the N. D.S.
so, uh, you think this Kelvin Blake guy's responsible for the shooting?
well, hopefully, we'll know soon enough.
chief. - Yes.
I talked Tommy into unofficially I. D. the two gangsters from the parking lot, Enrique Santos and Alonso Garcia.
how'd you do that?
put together some photo line ups.
and I told him, "if our shooter here picks out the same guys, you would never have to go to court.
and he believed you?
why do people ever talk to us?
all right. Uh, thank you. These, uh -- these will be very helpful.
now, if you and lieutenant Flynn could track down mr. Santos and mr. Garcia, bring them in there, thank you.
Yes, Ma'am.
good evening, Mr. Blake. I'm deputy chief Johnson.
I want to thank you so much for being so cooperative with my detectives.
I'm happy to help out.
tell you the truth, you know, these gangsters -- they got friends.
I'd rather just forget about the whole thing.
well, unfortunately, sir, discharging a firearm in a public place is against the law.
so just forgetting about the whole thing isn't an option.
I understand you were read and waived your rights.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I -- I was just protecting myself.
why don't you start by walking us through what happened last friday night?
okay. I got off work late.
didn't feel like making dinner, so I thought I'd go by the gas mart and grab a hot dog.
and what time was that?
9: 00. Little after 9: 00.
okay. And so?
so I pulled in.
and I'm standing at the register when I look out and I see two boys coming from across the street.
and I-I recognized the look on their faces, 'cause it's my hood, right?
and I'm thinking, "I got to get back in my car before they steal it.
so I ran out, jumped in the driver's seat.
but they stood behind me. See, they wouldn't let me back out.
did they threaten you in any way?
Yes! They told me to get out of the car.
this is the gun that, uh...
you gave my detectives, correct?
Yes, Ma'am.
I mean, I knew people were gonna be after my car. I mean, the rims alone.
I just thought I needed a little firepower to hold onto it.
so, wait, you bought a car that you thought you needed a gun to hang on to?
wait a second. Wait a second. Let's just -- let's just back up.
you got to understand, I mean, I worked my whole life to be able to have a car like that.
there was no way I was gonna let them gangsters take my Cadillac from me.
I mean, you would have done the same thing, right, man?
just... what happened next, sir?
so they told me to get out the car.
so I did, only they didn't know I was armed, you know?
so right away, I point the gun at them. I told them to back off.
they just laugh at me, like -- like I'm joking, tell me to give them my keys or else.
one of them said, "homey, I'm gonna look great in your car.
I thought, "the hell you are," so I just...
capped off a few rounds over their heads.
and what did they do?
they ran, both of them, talking about "I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.
I want you to think about this very carefully, Kelvin.
what was going on in your mind when you pulled out the gun?
I was afraid, you know? I'm still afraid.
I mean, I got to drive down that street every day.
I knew they'd probably remember what I look like and my car.
I knew they'd remember that, too.
probably come and find me, just like you guys did.
which is why it's so important that you identify these men so that they can't come and find you.
so if you could, um, please take a look at these gentlemen, tell me if you recognize anyone.
Yeah, that's one of them right there.
that's the other one.
you sure? - Yeah, yeah. That's them.
okay. Thanks.
so, Kelvin, tell me, um, when you fired those rounds, did you ever wonder where they were gonna end up?
no.
Why? What happened?
when you shot at those boys, one of the bullets went on for a while -- two whole blocks
and ended up in the back of the head of a man ...
by the name of reggie gray. - No, no, no.
he died instantly. - Oh, no, no, no, no!
Oh, my god! Oh, my
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt nobody. I didn't mean -- oh, my god!
Oh, man! Did he have a family? Did he...
so, Sanchez and I spent all night looking for these two dirtbags.
we finally found them this morning, walking up to the same service station.
probably gonna jack another car.
what's this?
we can now monitor the electronics room and the interview room from out here...
and from two angles.
or just one. Or this one.
and it's wireless. Pretty cool, huh?
tao, would you stop moving the picture around, damn it?
y-you're making me dizzy. Settle somewhere.
man, I want something to eat. - Yeah.
I'm not your waiter.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford a lawyer... - It's, like, amazing.
excuse me for a minute.
settle someplace, tao! Now I'm not kidding!
did you understand what I just told you?
alonso and Enrique's rap sheets.
and we just got positive I. D.S on both of them for three other recent carjackings
one at the same gas station a few weeks ago.
thank you, sergeant.
let's see what our busy little gangsters have to say for themselves.
gentlemen... thank you so much for joining us.
stand up.
you're welcome, bitch. - Well...
so much for hello.
do you have any idea why we asked you to pop by here today?
you want to have my baby?
I'll tell you this one time. You better show some respect!
or else. Stand here.
let's, uh -- let's start over, shall we?
uh, I believe that you gentlemen were shot at in the parking lot at the central food and gas mart on Crenshaw the night before last.
does that ring any bells?
uh, lieutenant...
I think we found the guy who shot at you.
that's why you're here.
y-you talking about that fool? - Do you recognize him, Enrique?
Yeah, the crazy bastard was at the filling station the other night.
he was waving his gun around, shouting some bullshit.
but we left after he started shooting.
shooting? At who?
what do you mean, "at who"? At us.
now, why would this man fire his gun at you?
did something happen?
did you maybe pay too much attention to his brand-new Cadillac?
it's a nice car, yeah.
but look, lady, he's the crazy one, pointing his shiny little piece at us because we said we liked his car.
what kind of a compliment did you pay his vehicle?
she means, "how did you tell him you liked the car?
I just said, you know, "I'd look real good driving that Cadillac around.
cause I would. - I bet you would.
do you think that maybe that's what this guy thought you were gonna do
jump in his car and drive off in it?
look, let me explain.
uh, as interested as I normally am in grand theft, what I really want to know about today is who killed Reggie Gray?
Reggie who?
the guy who was shot at the community center last friday night by this man here.
Oh, okay. Oh, you see? I told you that dude was crazy.
he tried killing us, too. Isn't that against the law, huh?
Yeah, he came after us. And I was gonna mess him up, you know? I wanted to. But
well, you can forget all about settling scores with him, because I'll be handling that.
all I want to know from you boys exactly what happened last friday night.
look, even if you were, say, trying to drive off in this man's car, murder is the only crime I care about today.
isn't that right, detective Sanchez?
we're asking you to help us deal with this guy who shot at you.
I mean, come on. How often does that happen?
I want to know about the moment he started shooting at you, okay?
yes? - Okay.
look, we only said something about...
about taking the car. We didn't actually do it.
and then that's when he pulled the gun.
I'm surprised you didn't grab it from him and shove it down his throat.
man, we thought about that, you know, but then he started
bam, bam, bam!-- Just like that.
you know, we knew he was serious.
tell her, man. Tell her that's the truth.
sabes que we didn't even get in that car, and that son of a bitch started shooting at us.
can you believe that? We didn't even get in it.
that's exactly what I thought happened.
now, if you could just, uh, write it all down, just what you said and, uh, sign it, and we'll be finished.
write what down?
just that you wanted to take this man's car, and for no other reason than that, he illegally discharged his weapon at you and that you, uh, fled the scene.
okay, wait a minute. Wait.
okay, we only tried to steal the car.
we didn't take it. - I completely understand.
in fact, just describe it that way. Say it just like that.
you only tried to steal this man's car.
a-and underline the word "try" so it's clear that it was just an attempt.
that's a good idea.
why is the chief unhappy?
that was the confession, wasn't it? I mean, am I missing something here?
she's probably already thinking about how she's going to explain all of this to Reggie's mom.
you spelled "Cadillac" wrong.
it's two l.
we rigged this up in a day.
imagine what we could do in a week.
I'm breathless.
okay. Let me take a look at that.
all right, uh, if you could just sign on the bottom.
all right, gentlemen.
I put the date right there, too. - Good idea.
now, I-I should probably explain the, uh, felony murder rule to you.
Oh, we don't care about that. As long as you got that fool, we're good.
I'm starving.
no, no, no, you really ought to understand about your future responsibilities in regards to Reggie Gray.
what responsibilities? We didn't agree to any responsibility.
S-shut up, Alonso.
I got to eat, okay? Can't this wait?
I hate to hold you up, but, um...
you really should understand what's gonna happen next, because when you're involved in a robbery, like only trying to steal this man's Cadillac, and someone gets shot during that attempt, whether the victim is right in front of you or two blocks away, if that person dies as a result of your actions, it's murder.
wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait.
so we're like witnesses now or what?
only if you decide to testify. - All right.
y-you're telling me we got to go to court?
I'm afraid so. But you don't have to testify if you don't want to, - because that's a right that you have under the 5th Amendment. - Yeah.
don't worry. Your lawyer will explain it all to you.
no, wait. Lawyers? We can't afford no lawyers.
I told you, if you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
enrique Santos and Alonso Garcia... - w-w-wait, what's going on here?
you're both under arrest for murder. - What are you doing?
get off me! - Hands down, too.
you'll figure it all out by the time you're arraigned.
look here. Now she's starting to perk up.
Oh, and, uh, if you boys are still hungry,
I'm sure we can rustle you up some bologna sandwiches and powdered eggs.
and I hope you like them, because where you're going, that's all you're gonna eat for the rest of your lives.
wait, wait. Hey, you get back here, you bitch!
so, you think Mrs. Gray's gonna be okay?
I think you defined "transferred intent" and "felony murder" as well as anyone could have.
guiding her through the mourning process
well, that's more my job than yours. - Yeah. It's just as well.
having your child shot dead because someone was trying to steal a car two blocks away seems awfully random to me.
I wouldn't say that, no.
please don't tell me you think that Reggie's murder was, what, part of god's grand design?
God's grand design. That's a little bit over my head.
but I don't believe in random.
but there was no motive in Reggie's death.
and -- and where there's no motive, there's no meaning.
well, you only think there's no meaning 'cause you're looking for it.
but meaning isn't something you find, chief Johnson.
it's something you give.
making sense out of Reggie's murder -- well, that's up to us.
so what meaning would you say it had?
well, I'd say that Reggie's death had brought this community closer together, don't you think?
including the neighborhood and the police.
including you and me.
now, that's something you don't see every day.
I can't believe you're falling for this.
what's a little paint, huh?
it's not gonna change anything.
and tomorrow or next week, this wall's gonna be covered in graffiti again.
well, until then...
sergeant.
sergeant, send units to my house now.
it's Stroh. He's here.
Yes, Sergeant Gabriel, what is it?
Gabriel: Chief, we got a body.
Gabriel: Good morning, Chief. Morning.
we're, uh, up the road, this way.
so, our victim is male, white, late 40s,
shot twice in the head.
the casings near the body are from a . 25 auto.
Brenda: who found him?
a couple of hikers around 6: 45 this morning
just in time, too,
because the coyotes were getting curious.
over here, S. I. D. found some fresh tire tracks.
it's a large tread, probably from an S. U. V. or a truck.
they're taking casts now.
uh, you feeling okay, Chief?
uh, yes. I just didn't sleep very well last night.
I need you to pull some more files for me.
still on the Stroh case?
he's a rapist and a murderer, and he's walking around free.
I don't see why I shouldn't be.
Yeah, well, it's just that I've already pulled you every sex offender he's represented In the past three years.
well, then, let's go back five, shall we?
tao: Chief, if it's all right, I was gonna go
head down to the Ranger's office,
check their...logs,
and, uh, see if there's been any activity in the last two days.
Yes, that's fine, Lieutenant.
what was that all about?
uh...
the body -- it's pretty awful.
[ clears throat ] Morning.
Oh, my word.
Provenza: There's more, Chief.
basically, his legs are ground to the bone,
and with his arms stretched like that and his hands tied
you're thinking this man was pulled behind a car.
but not around here. There's no drag marks anywhere.
found this lying under the body,
so it probably wasn't a robbery.
thank you. Do we have a time of death?
uh, between 1: 00 and 4: 00 this morning.
Gabriel: Is it him?
it was Mr. Howard Greeson.
wait a minute, chief. Let me take a look at that.
I think I know who he was.
yeah -- Greeson, same guy.
this bastard killed two girls in the '90s,
but we could never prove it.
who was the lead detective? - A guy named Joey O.
retired a few years back -- really good cop.
Oh, damn boy scout.
see if you can bring him in.
maybe he can give us some background information.
sure. I got his number. I'll give him a call.
this is really gonna make his day. [ laughs ]
uh, Lieutenant, this man might be a murderer,
but he is definitely our victim.
let's not forget that.
the two rounds in his head shattered on impact.
both wrists are broken. He's got three snapped ribs.
both shoulders are dislocated.
he's got a shattered hip, a busted femur in his right leg,
and then there's the feet.
so, all consistent with being dragged behind a car?
looks like it, and judging from the point
at which the drag marks begin -- from the chest down
I'd guess it was a larger vehicle
that kept him slightly elevated.
like a truck or an S. U. V. - Mm.
other than that, the bruising on his face indicates
that he was beaten up while he was still alive.
and... one more weird thing.
Oh, please.
the drag wounds aren't fresh.
so, what does that mean?
that he wasn't dragged last night but two nights ago.
the killer waited 24 hours to kill him.
Why? Why would he do that?
good question.
anyway, I sent for a tox screen
to see what kind of painkillers he was given. - Painkillers?
I am assuming whoever kept him alive that extra day
did not want to hear him scream.
Provenza: Well, no one's filed
a missing-persons report on Greeson.
and his record's clean since a D. U. I. bust in '99.
lived in Vegas from '02 to '07.
drives a 15-year-old GMC truck,
and up until a few days ago,
he was a security guard at a mall.
how about we say he dragged himself
and then chalk this whole mess up to a suicide?
how about we don't? Lieutenant Tao?
okay, according to park logs from last night,
we have a couple drunk-and-disorderlies,
a hooker turning a trick,
and a homeless man who swore he was Moses.
[ sighs ] So nothing out of the ordinary.
Oh, by the way, Joey O. is downstairs.
commander Taylor's bringing him up.
Oh, we are delirious with excitement.
Oh, cool it. That was years ago.
he wrote me up for using curse words.
and that's bullshit.
chief? - Hmm?
no match for the casings from the gun used on Greeson.
and here are the Stroh files you asked for this morning. - Oh, thank you so much.
Hey, everybody. Flynn: Hey, there he is.
Hi, Joe. how are you? - Hey, Andy.
how are you doing? You're looking good. - So are you.
lieutenant Tao. uh, Provenza.
you look great, Joey.
you lost weight.
Yeah, 30 pounds.
uh, cut out the fast food -- stuff will kill you.
I must've come on shortly after you left.
detective Olin, pleasure to meet you, sir.
and you, ma'am.
I do appreciate you calling me in on this.
chief, I got the warrant for Greeson's home.
surveillance hasn't seen any activity.
um, do you want me to take a look?
Yes, please -- uh, you and Sergeant Gabriel.
well, this certainly is one way
to administer the death penalty, huh?
we were hoping you could give us
some background on your old cases.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, no. That's all right. I've got my own file here.
uh, lived with Greeson for three years.
they were gonna get married,
and then she postponed the wedding.
a few weeks later, her father called January '97 -- said she was missing.
you mind my putting this up here? - Of course.
Katie West -- now, he met her a year later,
and he moved her in, along with her 6-year-old daughter, Jenna.
now, Jenna says that it wasn't a happily-ever-after situation,
and the mother wanted to move out.
but before she had a chance, uh, she disappeared.
never could find the bodies, so I couldn't build a case.
um, Detective Olin,
it's been years since your victims vanished.
any idea why someone would want to do this to Mr. Greeson now?
uh, that is the million-dollar question, isn't it?
Mm. Where did you find him?
Elysian park.
you're serious?
Mm-hmm.
well, now, we did think
that Greeson buried the bodies there.
you see, we went through that place over and over again.
this is where we found Greeson.
did you look here?
you're talking this fire road? - Mm-hmm.
well, that was washed out back then.
I didn't think to look there.
well, let's get some cadaver dogs
and head back to the park, shall we?
so, um...
...how's Darleen?
well, I retired. She divorced me.
turns out we didn't get along.
how about you? What wife are you on?
Oh. I'm single.
Mm.
dating someone, though.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
she's 29.
Really?
well, I've got the prostate of a teenager.
I lost my prostate last year.
don't always know when I'm gonna pee
apart from that, no big loss.
someone dug her up.
Brenda: Oh.
wait.
sorry, Chief.
could we leave the bag intact so S. I. D. can check for prints?
I mean, if we're gonna tie Greeson into this...
he's right. Let's leave it.
chief, there's another one dug up over here.
okay, so, Greeson was tortured
to find out where he buried the bodies.
so the killer dug up the bags, confirming the information,
then shot Greeson in the head and left his wallet
so he could be identified quickly.
not exactly how I figured this case would be closed, but...
there you go.
this case isn't closed.
Fritz: So, did anybody show up with a fresh motive?
uh, Detective Sanchez served a warrant at Mr. Greeson's house this afternoon
and found his girlfriend with a black eye,
packed up, and on her way out the door.
she the type to strike back hard?
I haven't met her, but it's the only motive I have that's the least bit timely.
otherwise, I'm looking
at the families of these dead girls.
no.
let me get the dishes.
they've been living with this for a long time.
why go after Greeson now?
I don't know. It's family.
it doesn't have to make sense.
which reminds me -- your mother called again.
Oh? - Yeah.
she wants to set a date
for your niece, Charlene, and her
to come down and visit
make sure you're not working when they get here.
now, how am I supposed to know
when someone is gonna get murdered?
for heaven's sakes, if I knew that, we'd close up shop.
Brenda, you need to make time for your mother.
look, heading major crimes is a full-time responsibility.
being good at your job doesn't give you the right
to ignore the people you love.
I'm not ignoring people!
But...my job has to be a priority.
that -- that's not news to you or my mother.
you know, hon, someday, when you look back on your life,
almost everything you see
will be marked off with crime-scene tape
because you didn't make time for much of anything else.
do you mind?
could you -- could you get the -- the phone, please?
you want me to answer your phone? - Please, if...
Hello?
chief, I think you got to come back in.
the families are here.
what families?
well, the fam-- the families of the dead girls.
Olin made notifications of the bodies we found.
What?!
fine.
um, I'll be right there.
hang up, please.
okay.
you see what I mean?!
this is what happens when I leave the office.
at least all your suspects are in the same place now.
don't worry, sweetie. I'll do the dishes.
I'm sorry!
would you come here, Sergeant?
who do we have here?
okay, so, uh, Dana Clarkson, Greeson's first victim
that's her father, Jake, there in the sports coat.
standing next to him is her sister, Amy. - Mm-hmm.
and Katie West, Greeson's second victim
the guy there drinking the coffee
that's her brother, Todd.
next to him is her daughter, Jenna.
okay, thank you.
uh, would you please tell Chief Pope
that I need to see him down here right away?
Yeah, you got it -- oh, and just so you know,
Sanchez has Greeson's current girlfriend in interview 1.
thank you.
tao: Here you go, sweetheart. Thank you.
sure.
detective Olin, may I speak with you for a moment, please?
yes? - Detective Olin,
who gave you the authority to notify these families?
well, I wasn't aware I needed authority.
I just did not want them to hear on the news
that we had discovered their daughters.
I'm sorry
is there a coroner's report that i don't know about,
because the last I checked, we hadn't positively I. D.'d these bodies yet.
come on, Chief, we all know
excuse me, Lieutenant. I'm asking a question.
well, ma'am, I'm sorry if I've stepped out of line,
but I have relationships with these families,
and I've been waiting a long time
look, if your relationships are gonna interfere with my case
all due respect,
this is just as much my case as it is yours.
detective Olin, you are retired.
you do not work here anymore.
now, I have a murder investigation
which he helped you solve.
I'm not talking about those girls, Lieutenant!
they are not my priority at the moment.
I'm currently more concerned with apprehending the person who is depraved and disturbed enough to drag someone around from the bumper of their car.
well, I'm sorry.
uh...
maybe you've never had a case like this.
[ echoing ] It stays with you.
and I did not check that washed-out road.
I made mistakes, but the D. A. is not gonna close my case until I link Greeson with those girls. - What?
you spoke to the D. A.?!
actually, he called me, ma'am.
you know how we close your case?
we close mine first, because if we're right
and the killer tortured Greeson to get information,
than the killer provides the link that the D. A. needs.
now, you know these people.
tell me who out there is capable of something like this.
they are not suspects.
in your case, but they are in mine.
in fact, let's start with you.
you still carry a side arm, Detective? - Chief.
Yeah.
it's a little bigger... than the one I used to have.
Really? Why's that?
well, I can't see so good anymore
and, uh, figure the bigger bullets will make up for it.
if you're looking for a . 25 automatic that killed Greeson,
it's probably his own gun.
he was a security guard at the mall.
I'm aware of that, Detective.
which of the victims' relatives knew that?
anybody can find that out.
look, has anyone, uh, run a reverse search on Greeson,
talked to the police in Vegas where he lived for five years,
spoken to their missing persons?
you're assuming this guy's been
on the straight and narrow all these years,
and I'm saying there may be some other dead girls out there
with some very angry relatives of their own!
look into them.
but leave these people alone.
chief, I told Greeson's girlfriend what happened to him.
she was upset, but there were no tears.
seems like a real hothead.
anyway, she doesn't have an alibi, but we don't have enough for an arrest.
well...I want to talk to her, but I can't do it right now.
we don't have anything to hold her on until the morning?
put her in the murder room. I'll find you something.
don't worry about it, Chief. Trust me.
chief Johnson.
thank you, gentlemen. excuse us.
did you hear about what Detective Olin did?
you want me to send him home? - No.
he's close to these people.
I want to see who he's most protective of.
look, i-i know one of those people out there
may be a murder suspect,
but, uh... they're all victims, too.
now, a good thing happened today.
we're close to solving two very cold cases,
so let's tread lightly, okay?
good.
all right, let's go talk to these people.
now, I know Detective Olin has informed you
about the two bodies that were found today,
and I know you want more information.
but in cases like this, it's important to be as thorough as possible.
and since we haven't actually I. D.'d the remains yet,
we're not 100% sure about what we're dealing with.
well, who the hell else would be buried out there?
this is what my mom was wearing the day she disappeared.
maybe you could recognize the shirt or her necklace.
uh, thank you. This -- this could help.
we do have, uh, a lot of information to sort through.
we have three separate investigations going.
three investigations?
well, you mean there was another girl?
excuse me, uh, Mr. West, is it?
Todd. yeah, I'm Katie's brother.
Mr. West, uh, there's not a third girl.
the third investigation is the murder of Howard Greeson, who, as you know
you're actually wasting time
investigating that dirtbag's case?!
well, sir, from what I know of him,
I don't like him much, either, but, um, he is a victim.
look, um, while you're all here,
why don't we get some general information from you,
like if you've seen Mr. Greeson recently?
what is this?! Are -- are -- are we suspects?!
um, sir, this is, um
this is a common procedure.
maybe it would be best if I spoke to each of you separately.
how dare you treat us like this?!
he killed my mother.
you have no right to keep me here.
chief, this is Kim Sherman, Greeson's girlfriend.
Hey, that's him. He's the one!
you killed Howie, didn't you?! didn't you?!
you killed him! - Calm down!
ma'am, you need to calm down.
he came to our house! You ruined everything!
what? I told her the truth about what Howie did.
that's it. I didn't kill him!
Hey, so, tell me.
when a classy dame like you is dating a double murderer,
how many dinners does he have to buy you before he gets to smack you around?
Oh! - Oh!
Hey! - Okay.
that's assaulting a police officer, lady!
that just earned yourself a night downstairs!
detective, get her out of here, please. - Yes, ma'am.
y-you're welcome.
uh, Mr. West, I-I'd like to hear more
about your visit to the victim's house.
look, I only went down there because -- Todd.
um...I want a lawyer.
Jenna, what about you?
I want a lawyer, too.
so do i.
I not only want a lawyer,
I'm calling a press conference.
wait, please.
involving the press at this point
will only complicate matters.
I don't care!
sir, I-I strongly urge you to reconsider.
why, to make it easier for you?
I've called here countless times,
just trying to press somebody into some kind of action.
and nobody cared.
now Greeson dies, and you want us to answer your questions?
Ah. I'm sorry.
we're just not interested anymore.
lieutenant Tao, I want you to bag all these cups.
I want, uh, the fingerprints,
especially off Mr. West's over here -- thank you.
sergeant, would you please call Ricardo Ramos?
I'd like him to know about this press conference.
Oh, by all means. let's invite everybody.
but I-I want to talk to him first.
I think it would be good for him to know
everything we have on these people and everything we don't.
detective, I want to thank you so much for your help.
we'll be taking it from here.
I'm sure that one of the detectives will call you when we close your case.
miss Sherman.
I'm Deputy Chief Johnson.
we didn't get a chance to meet last night.
well, you lost your temper.
assaulting a police officer in a police station
makes me wonder what you'd be like
out in the real world with a boyfriend who beats you.
you think I killed Howie?
detective Sanchez here
tells me that you were running off when he served the warrant at your house.
where were you going?
away.
I don't know where. I just wanted to get away.
seems a little coincidental, don't you think?
you just happen to be skipping town on the same day that your boyfriend was found murdered.
and what about that guy last night, hmm -- Todd?
you guys arrest him?
besides you, Miss Sherman, no one has been arrested.
so you're hassling me instead of him, hmm?
Todd West came to our house.
he threatened Howie. He said he wanted to do...
when did he come to your house? - The first time -- two weeks ago.
first time? - Yeah!
I'm at home alone.
Todd West, he showed up, and he just starts.
he's -- he tells me these things about Howie,
about those two other girls.
and what did you do?
I didn't believe him.
it was -- it was crazy.
but then Todd -- he comes back a week later.
Howie was leaving for work.
Todd -- he stopped him, starts yelling at him in the driveway,
punches him while he's still in his truck.
Howie had to pull a gun on him just to get him to back off.
did Mr. West say anything to indicate why he was showing up now after all these years?
no.
but it changed everything, okay?
Howie was... different after that.
how do you mean? - He was just
he was just angry. You know?
he -- he started drinking a lot.
and then what Todd had said started eating at me,
so I look it up on the internet, and, uh...
I read about them.
those other girls.
I imagine it must've been difficult to see
that the boyfriend that you love so much
sought out weak, needy women.
I'm not weak.
no, you're a fighter, aren't you?
I guess wouldn't have been hard for you to subdue Howie,
especially if he was drunk.
and then all you had to do was put the car in drive.
speaking of which, I didn't find the truck
or the . 25-caliber auto
when I served the search warrant at your house.
maybe because I haven't seen the truck since he drove it to work on Saturday morning,
and the gun's probably still under the front seat.
that was the last time you saw him? - Yeah!
Yeah.
we were fighting.
I asked him about the girls, and he...
he never hit me before, okay?
the way he looked at me, I thought he was gonna kill me.
so when he didn't come home that night or the next...
I just started packing.
your boyfriend beats you, and it takes you two days to leave?
I had nowhere to go!
you have any idea where he was all this time?
I don't know.
there's a bar in Culver city -- The Leg Room.
I thought he was there on a bender.
and I didn't want to be around when he came home.
Hey, Chief. - Yes?
Ramos is up in Pope's office. he wants to talk to you.
Oh, okay. thank you, commander.
Oh, Lieutenant Tao, would you and Sergeant Gabriel
please visit this Leg Room,
see if we can retrace Mr. Greeson's steps
on the night he disappeared?
thank you.
chief, what do you want to do with the girlfriend?
tell her she's not going home.
you just want to see me get slapped again.
the thought never crossed my mind.
so, you managed
to talk to the family members on your own?
I did.
got some pretty interesting stuff, too,
like where everyone was at the time of the murder.
I think you guys call them, uh, alibis.
and just so we're clear, no one from this department
asked you to obtain that information.
of course not -- as a journalist,
it would be unethical for me to collude with law enforcement.
okay, now, that being said, before I publish my story tomorrow,
there is something else I want to include.
we already gave you everything we had.
Yeah, well, Joey O. didn't.
Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. That's not possible.
well, fine. Then you'll have to wait for tomorrow's paper for the alibis.
that's assuming that my editor includes them in the paper.
why do you want to talk to Mr. Olin, anyway?
heroic cop closes his last case -- it's a great story.
Mr. Ramos, if this case closes, I will be doing it.
and stop calling him Joey O. . it's ridiculous.
am I gonna talk to him or not?
all right, let's get it over with.
yeah? Good.
you can, uh, have your people confirm the alibi,
but I ran a cursory check.
they all held up, except the brother's. Todd West.
his wife and kids were out of town, so no one can vouch for him.
okay. Thank you so much.
uh, there's one more thing, Chief.
I'm not really sure how important this is,
but, uh, Todd and Katie West -- they were twins.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
we got a green truck.
ticketed this morning.
got a trailer hitch on the back.
huh.
keys in the ignition.
Oh, wow, we got a shovel
and a steel cable with a loop on each end.
got a gun. Whoa.
Whoa!
you got your camera phone?
Oh, man. Yeah.
there you go. - Thank you.
we hear about any altercations around the bar the night Greeson disappeared?
tao knocked on doors,
and he said nobody reported anything out of the ordinary.
we've I. D.'d your two Jane does, Chief Johnson.
the body in bag one is Dana Clarkson.
and the body in bag two is Katie West.
okay. It's official... finally.
also, I was right about your dragging victim.
tox screen found high levels of morphine in his system.
morphine? - Good call, doctor.
Yes, it was.
thank you.
the casings we found at the crime scene
are a match to Greeson's gun, and we pulled a clean set of prints from the driver's-side door of Greeson's truck.
and those prints match the ones we pulled off of Todd West's coffee cup last night.
well, I guess you didn't know these people as well as you thought, detective Olin.
sergeant, would you and lieutenant Provenza
please bring Todd West in for a chat?
chief, he has a lawyer.
fine. Then, uh, arrest him for murder.
pardon me.
I've known Todd West for 10 years. He ain't your guy.
well, we have some pretty compelling evidence that says otherwise.
it's all circumstantial. - Oh, you're a lawyer now?
well, Mr. West already has one of those, thanks to you.
okay, you're mad at me. I get it.
and now that we have filed charges,
he can sit in jail for the next two years awaiting trial
while I find the rest of the evidence i need
to put him away for life.
so...I hope you're expecting to wait
because you won't be closing your case anytime soon.
all right.
I hear that Lieutenant Tao
canvassed the neighborhood around that bar,
and, the night that Howie disappeared,
there were no reports of arguments or fights.
so whoever he left with he left with willingly,
and it would not have been Todd West, drunk or not!
fine, look, if you think that Todd West is innocent,
have him come in here and talk to me...
without a lawyer.
I can't do that.
how badly do you want to close your case?
because that's not gonna happen
until I find out who murdered Howard Greeson.
how you holding up?
this is crazy, Joe.
maybe if you just sit down with her
and tell her the truth.
without my lawyer?
you don't have anything to hide, do you?
no. Of course not.
well, then, listen to me.
if you try to duck behind a lawyer,
it's only gonna make things worse, you understand?
just answer her questions. You'll be okay.
you're sure about this?
Yeah, I'm sure.
you're doing the right thing, Joey.
Yeah, we'll see.
thank you.
detective, you feeling okay?
pretty sick to my stomach, Chief.
Mr. West, would you mind standing up for a moment, please?
thank you, sir. Have a seat.
all right, Mr. West, I want to thank you so much
for coming in to talk to us.
I'll be frank.
there's a lot of evidence in the murder of Howard Greeson
that points in your direction,
but let's do what we can now
to eliminate you as a suspect, okay?
great. Okay, yeah.
so, apparently, you told a member of the press
that you were at home Saturday and Sunday night.
but your wife and children were out of town all weekend,
so they were unable to corroborate that statement.
Plus, we found your prints on the victim's truck... - What?
...the same vehicle behind which we believe... - Wait.
that the victim was dragged. - What is this?!
I thought I was being eliminated as a suspect!
well, you can certainly see
how difficult that is to do, sir,
especially since, my gosh, you certainly have motive.
I mean, your twin sister
no one could hardly blame you for doing something like this.
so, tell me, how can we explain
your fingerprints on the victim's truck?
I don't know.
I must have left them when I went to his house.
I mean, he was backing out of his driveway
when he pulled a gun on you from underneath the front seat of his pickup.
so you knew he had a weapon, and you wanted him dead.
Yes. I did.
but what I wanted more...
was to find my sister...
to see her one more time and to bring her home.
Mr. West...
does anyone in your family take pain medication
morphine, for example?
in my family?
no.
Why?
do you know anyone who takes morphine,
who has access to it?
no.
all right.
Mr. West, let's, uh, get back to the evidence.
we have a witness who saw you threaten and assault the victim
just one week before he was found murdered.
I was worked up, all right? I had been looking through the old articles.
why, Mr. West? - Why?
I don't know. I was angry, and I
why now after all this time? It's been 10 years.
why now?!
it must have been something
that got you all riled up and
I got fed up, all right,
sick of waiting for someone to care!
I mean, since Joe's retired, you people haven't done a thing!
you weren't visiting Greeson on mine and Katie's birthday!
you weren't calling him every year on the date she disappeared!
that's what Joe was doing!
he was the only person keeping this case alive, but he
he -- he wasn't going to do it anymore,
so I picked up the slack.
why was he not gonna do that anymore?
why, Mr. West?!
I want my lawyer back.
fine. I can arrange that for you.
Mr. Ramos, Buzz,
would you please excuse us for a moment?
detective Olin...
why weren't you gonna be able to harass Mr. Greeson anymore
with your phone calls and your visits?
I don't know why he said that.
I wasn't planning on stopping.
Mr. West here said
all he wanted was to find his twin sister,
to see her one more time.
but these bags were sealed shut when we found them,
and the killer unearthed both bodies,
which makes me think that the person who dug them up
was looking more for the scene of a double murder
than a sister...
like you were, Detective.
the only evidence you have against me
is my devotion to this case.
you said yourself that Mr. Greeson
must've gone willingly with his captor.
I imagine he wouldn't have argued with a badge,
even if yours is retired.
and it had to be someone
who knew that he had a weapon and where he kept it.
so, tell me, Detective.
how much more time do you have?
you see, I-I couldn't understand
why someone would do this to Mr. Greeson now...
after all this time,
unless time itself is running out.
and if you factor in the weight loss
and the prostate
you told Lieutenant Provenza you had removed
and the queasy stomach due to what I assume must be
the morphine that you're taking...
I'm forced to conclude that you have cancer,
detective Olin, and that you are dying.
so I'll ask you again.
how much more time do you have?
three to six months.
lieutenant, would you please, um,
read Detective Olin his rights?
okay. You have the right to remain silent.
no, no, no. Please wait.
in the interest of time, I waive my rights.
you are a lifelong and decorated member of the law-enforcement community.
how could you do something like this?
the Make A Wish Foundation refused to do it for me.
I didn't want to die
knowing I'd failed those girls,
knowing that Greeson
wasn't gonna pay for what he did.
you can't understand that?
no.
I could never do what you did.
Oh, never say never.
well, look, now that your case is closed,
then we can close mine, right?
as long as you can demonstrate
that it was Mr. Greeson who led you to find those girls.
Oh, I can do you better than that.
Greeson can tell you himself.
what's that?
I recorded the whole thing. He admits it all.
it ain't for the faint of heart.
you wanted to know how far I'd go to close my case.
I took him to the desert,
I hooked him to the back of the truck,
and I drove...
all night.
let's, uh, get this over with.
no cuffs, Lieutenant.
chief?
yes?
Yeah, um...
I was wondering.
you know, Joey doesn't have much time left,
and what he did, some might say, was justified.
lieutenant. - Yeah, I-I know, okay.
y-you don't see it that way. Fine.
all I'm asking is that you speak to the D. A.
and maybe they can set a bail for him
so that he can get out until his trial.
I'm afraid I can't do that. - Why not?
what if he has a list?
what if he comes up with a few more scores
he'd like to settle?
are you willing to take that risk?
because I'm not.
uh, Lieutenant.
would you please book this into evidence?
I don't want to listen to it.
Yeah. Neither do i.
night, Chief.
good night.
Hey.
Hi.
how'd it go?
we closed it.
good for you.
your mother called again.
do you think it's too late to call back?
Yes, I do.
well, sometimes she watches the late movie.
Hi, mama.
Oh, did I wake you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just returning your call.
Yes, all three of them.
Yes, yes, I-I'd love to pick a good time
for Charlene to come visit.
Oh, I miss you, too, mama.
I guarantee you this will be on the detectives exam.
transferred intent.
Yeah, well, believe me -- that one, I know.
delivery for major crimes!
one, two, three, four, five boxes.
this one's not mine.
it says "major crimes, L. A. P. D.
but I didn't order this.
you're major crimes. and it's C. O. D.
I don't know. Duct tape's never a good thing.
did you say "duct tape"?
you're good to go.
Unh-unh, unh-unh-unh! Not by my desk, Julio!
now, I mean it.
where should we take it?
Gabriel: We should call the Chief.
there's no need to alarm her.
Flynn: okay.
here goes nothing.
all right, out. Ev-- everybody out.
now we alarm the Chief.
Brenda: Oh, for heaven's sakes, her feet were so small!
grauman's Chinese Theater was built in 1927.
there are nearly 200 Hollywood-celebrity handprints, footprints, and autographs in the concrete of the theater's forecourt.
Uh-huh.
are these, like, people who used to be famous or something? - That's right.
this is not working.
what are you talking about? Charlie's having a great time. - Aah!
she's not having a great time.
stop with the tourist attractions.
take your niece to the grove or to have lunch.
go ahead -- anything to end this.
she's having a great time.
Hello?
chief!
um, yeah, I-I know you said not to call
unless it was important, but we, uh...
well, we ended up with a crime scene.
where is it?
Ohh!
chief.
we're calling him "Jack," like in Jack-in-the-box.
you get it?
Yes, Lieutenant, I get it.
what I don't get is how Mr. box ended up in my office!
well, I...may have suggested
Oh, Lieutenant!
I won't be able to breathe in here for weeks!
do we know where he came from?
the return address says, "Greg Lewis,"
stow nuff self storage in Reseda.
he's on his way in already, Chief.
I'll get him in a room for you.
thank you.
Oh, hi, Chief.
Ugh. What is that?
scented candles. it'll help with the smell. - Oh.
Oh. Chief Johnson?
Ugh. Yuck.
sorry, Dr. Morales.
Ugh. I-I assume that's the body.
Flynn: yeah. we're calling him "Jack," as in
jack-in-the-box.
I get it, yes -- very amusing.
well, smells like murder to me.
Oh, hello, Terrence.
it's Dr. Terrence now. I finished med school.
Oh. now I'm doing my residency down in the decomp room.
you should stop by. We get great muffins down there.
paging Dr. Terrence! - Oh, sorry.
the good news is the body seems to have been kept virtually intact because of the plastic and the duct tape.
So...Dr. Terrence hopefully will find a cause of death
quickly!
thank you, Dr. Morales.
Ohh.
buzz, would you please close... the door? Thank you.
I'm so sorry, y'all.
there was a dead person in that box?
Yes.
now what are we gonna do about...?
uh, I could be fine at the house watching TV.
or maybe I could make you guys dinner.
mom and dad work,
so I end up doing a lot of that at home.
dinner sounds great.
okay, well, I'll, um -- I'll see y'all later.
Bye. Shall we?
just button it up till the boss gets here, okay?
Ah, Deputy Chief Johnson,
uh, meet Greg Lewis.
he is the owner of stow nuff storage.
thank you for coming in today. - Uh-huh.
I'm guessing you got my package.
Yes, sir, we did!
well, finally -- I've been trying to get the police to look at that box for almost a month.
excuse me?
I reported it to the L. A. P. D. four times, and no one came!
finally, I talked to some old cranky guy
no offense -- an officer Katzman.
I said, "I have this box,
and I think it could be something major."
so he told me to mail it to major crimes.
so, what's in it?!
you don't know? - Unh-unh.
looked like trouble. No way I was opening it.
well, sir, as it turns out, you sent us a dead body!
I knew it!
the duct tape -- it scared the crap out of me.
so, whose body is it?
we were hoping you could tell us.
you think that i... killed someone
and then I mailed the body to you?
how stupid would that be?
well, where did you find the cooler, sir?
unit 943 in my storage facility!
Courtney defaulted on paying his -- Courtney?
Doug Courtney, the guy that's renting 943! Oy!
he was using our automatic-payment feature, but his debit card is expired.
so I tried to get in touch with him for the standard 60 days, but he never got back to me,
which would have allowed us to auction off his stuff.
but the only thing in 943 was that horrible box.
sir, can you tell us...
...the last time Mr. Courtney was at your facility?
no idea.
I only see people when they fill out the rental application.
I could fax that to you. Hmm?
Flynn: Well, there's not much here, chief.
just an address and a phone number
12 lane "A," Sunny Estates, Los Angeles, California.
it's a mobile-home park.
it's Mr. Courtney's parents' address -- his mother and his stepfather.
and Mr. Courtney has a record shoplifting, two counts of assault.
TAYLOR: Wait, wait.
just because Courtney has a record
doesn't mean he killed Mr. box.
uh, and we can't say for sure
that Mr. box was actually murdered.
well, we know that he was broken in half
and folded into an ice cooler.
which is suspicious to me.
detective Sanchez?
well, according to the DMV,
Mr. Courtney has a 1997 red Chevy Camaro.
registration lapsed in 2006,
no outstanding citations, no flags,
doesn't seem to be stolen, Chief.
and, uh, his only financial activity in the past three years
are two deposits from an offshore bank account.
and this is the same account which Mr. Courtney
it is, and it still has plenty of money in it.
I mean, if the card hadn't expired,
the victim would probably still be in storage.
so, where did Mr. Courtney go?
maybe he killed Jack box
and then skipped the country, Chief.
$20 says he went to Mexico!
$20, Thailand.
I mean, they go to Thailand a lot lately.
I'll put 20 on Kuala Lumpur.
not only is it fun to say,
but they have the largest department store in Malaysia.
useful information, Lieutenant. Useful, please.
I'll call our customs liaison and do a passport check.
thank you.
chief, it is Dr. Terrence.
Yes, Terrence?
uh, sorry it's taken so long,
but, uh, I'm having a hard time getting this guy out of your box.
that didn't sound right.
do you have a cause of death yet?
uh, not yet, but there was a wallet in the body's pants pocket.
and I, uh, took the liberty of matching your victim's thumbprint to his driver's license.
so, who is he?
Oh, for heaven's sakes. Thank you.
all bets are off, gentlemen. - Why?
it turns out our killer is our victim.
I don't think there's gonna be any traffic,
but I will -- oh.
can you hold on one second? What name? All right.
um...I'm sorry. I'm just signing for something here.
thank you.
uh, yeah, I can take care of all that today.
all right, I'll see you soon.
Hey, Charlie, you've got some ma
some mail.
you got a care package, huh? From home?
Yeah, from my friend Amy. I'm thanking her now.
you gonna open it?
no. Uh, it's just
I didn't realize I was gonna be here for this long,
and there's some personal items.
you want to see?
Oh, oh, uh, no, no. that's, uh -- that's okay.
well, um...I'm going.
okay, bye.
y-you call me if you need me.
I will.
and the emblem?
uh, the California grizzly bear.
its name is Monarch,
and the, uh, flag was officially adopted as the state flag in 1911.
and I have no idea why that would be on the detectives exam.
you'll be asked everything from law to policy to California history, so you have to be prepared.
Oh, sorry.
there are two things we need to remember before we speak to the Dobsons.
one -- whoever killed Doug Courtney
knew about the storage facility,
and a missing-persons report was never filed.
so, we're not just here to make a notification
to the victim's parents, but also to -- what?
interview potential suspects.
exactly.
now, I'll ask a few questions.
and when you feel like we have enough information
to warrant a notification, you step in.
the desire of the slothful shall killed him,
for his hands refuse to labor.
proverbs 21: 25.
now, Doug cares only for the things of this world
liquor, gambling, surfing, sex.
he ignores that which is eternal.
horrible how many people do that. - Hmm.
uh, Mr. Dobson, Mrs. Dobson,
when was the last time you heard from your son?
Doug is only my stepson.
I didn't get ahold of him until he was a teenager.
by that time, he was hard to reach.
I tried, though.
I've had success with... other people,
like -- like Sarah here.
but, uh, as far as the last time we saw him and
well, Doug hasn't been here for over three years.
and you never filed a missing-persons report?
he only came by here when he needed money.
b-but the last time he was here, he was different.
h-he wasn't worried as much,
and he -- he said everything was gonna be okay.
and what happened? He left without a word.
and he hasn't called us from that day to this.
but he said that he was gonna make sure that he re
I have told you a thousand times
just be grateful that he is gone, be thankful.
we are. we're thankful.
when Doug was, uh, here last,
did he leave any of his belongings behind,
a -- a computer or a journal?
no, h-he -- oh.
Oh, it's okay. I got it.
no, he put everything he had in a storage facility.
now, why are you really here?
I don't see you driving out here just to ask a few questions,
unless something's wrong.
what has Doug gotten into?
well, Mr. and Mrs. Dobson,
I'm really sorry to have to tell you this, but your son
we haven't been honest with you.
Mr. Gabriel here isn't from the L. A. P. D.
he's a...credit agent from American Express.
your son is the victim of identity theft,
which is why we've been looking for him.
uh, Mr. Gabriel here knows much more about the ins and outs of this than I do.
so, um, while you're explaining everything to the Dobson's,
I'm gonna just head out to my car
to look through it real fast.
I'll be back in a jiffy. One second.
what -- what is she talking about?
um, well, I'm afraid that someone in...
Brazil...
has charged $20, 000 to your son's account with us, so...
so, we got two wet suits, some sandy towels,
and three kinds of surfboard wax.
so, I'm going out on a limb here,
but I say the contents of this duffel bag
says Mr. Courtney was a surfer.
tao: And an avid lotto player.
there's over 200 lottery tickets here,
all with the same 6 numbers
there's nothing strange about that.
I bet the same six numbers all the time.
yeah? And how's that working out?
the odds of ever hitting a Jackpot are
tao, please. Let me dream.
the stack of mail we got from Courtney's P. O. box
uh, DWP, credit card, cellphone
by the looks of it, this guy owed money to everyone.
Terrence: Chief Johnson?
Terrence. Terrence, what a surprise.
uh, Dr. Terrence. - Right.
uh, I have cause of death for Mr. Courtney.
figured I'd, uh, bring the results by in person.
and those results would be?
well, the victim's body was well-preserved.
whoever wrapped him up did a nice job of it.
cause of death.
murder.
uh, Mr. Courtney had two bullet wounds to the back,
right above the lumbar vertebrae.
I'm putting a time of death at May 21, 2006,
sometime after 6: 12 p. m.
that's awfully exact. Are you sure?
I'm a coroner now, Chief Johnson.
of course I'm sure. - Hmm.
but if you can't put faith in me as a doctor,
put your faith in the newspapers.
newspapers? What newspapers?
the ones at the bottom of the cooler,
dated May 21, 2006.
Oh.
also, there was a receipt for two hot dogs and a 40 of malt liquor -- same date, 6: 12 p. m.
what is malt liquor?
sanchez: Chief.
Mm. Yes?
I have Mr. Courtney's
I have Mr. Courtney's girlfriend,
Tara Latimer, set up in interview 1.
I thought Doug was the one. He was funny, tan.
where did you meet him?
the casino where I worked. I was a blackjack dealer.
Oh, so he worked there, too.
no.
he gambled there... a lot.
Latimer: We'd only been dating about a month when he asked me to move in with him, and I don't know how he afforded the place
after I left, but I can be pretty sure
that the landlord didn't cut him any slack.
he hated Doug.
he was the worst tenant I ever had!
I should have evicted his ass at the first sign of trouble!
two years of his crap was enough.
Gaviota: I got tired of hearing how he lost all of his rent money gambling at the...
slot machines.
you know, throwing his money at the lottery,
the same six numbers -- his and his parents' birthdays.
going all-in on Texas hold 'em when he had nothing in his hand.
his whole life... was a bluff, including his... work reference from his boss.
what's his name? Jordan Wallace.
Doug never worked for me.
well, he listed you as his employer on his rental application.
I was his best friend since high school, and he needed a reference.
and when the landlord called, I said Doug was a good guy.
what I should have said was...
he was a pig.
he was an asshole.
he was a leech.
I kept loaning him money until he was into me for 10 grand.
I know it doesn't seem like much now.
but when I was starting my real-estate business
high-end homes all over the world
that money meant everything.
Yeah, Mr. Wallace,
do you remember the last time you saw Mr. Courtney?
well, I remember the last time I didn't see him.
uh, I went over to court's apartment to help him move his stuff into a storage unit.
he never showed up.
and I finally gave up on his returning the key.
and no one was there.
well, I -- I called the girl he used to live with.
she says that he moved everything out to a storage unit in the valley.
Gabriel: So, they all knew about the storage unit.
his crap was still there in the apartment.
screwed me out of all my money.
then he screwed my daughter.
another girl... in our bed.
nobody cheats on me.
not with my daughter.
everybody wanted to kill him and feed him to the sharks.
so, Sergeant Gabriel,
if you were taking the lead on this investigation,
how would you sum it up so far?
well...
I'd say Mr. Courtney took advantage of everyone he knew
and his disappearing is probably the best thing to happen to these people.
which makes them all suspects.
uh, aunt Brenda, you're home...early.
uh, did you find your killer?
no.
what's that delicious smell?
it's supposed to be a surprise.
but I promise...
we're gonna have a fun, fun dinner.
okay.
Charlie, how long did you say till dinner's ready?
uh, I'll have it on the table in another hour.
okay.
aunt Brenda, dinner's ready.
Charlie... we need to talk.
aunt Brenda, you went in my room?
I stole a brownie.
or two.
or three.
Oh, my god.
these are the very best brownies I have ever had in my entire life!
did you make these from scratch?
and you had...three?
Oh, biscuits!
Oh, potatoes!
chicken-fried steak!
Oh, brown okra!
staking out that storage facility
isn't working out like I thought it would.
I hate working out.
me, too!
Maybe...it was the victim's girlfriend, 'cause he cheated on her with the landlord's daughter.
maybe it was him -- the landlord, I mean.
maybe it's his friend that he mooched from
maybe it's his stepfather.
he's so mean.
May...be...
Hey, sorry I'm so late.
that's okay, uncle Fritzy!
Brenda? What's going on?
I'm singing!
you always said I had a great voice.
what's going on here?
we're having second helpings of the best southern dinner this side of the Mississippi
chicken-fried steak, fried okra,
and the very best brownies made in human history.
Really? She made brownies?
no -- don't. Wait. Wait until after you eat.
sweetheart, sweetheart.
Mm-hmm? Sweetie?
hmm? Why don't you go get in bed?
and I'll be there in a minute, okay?
we have company!
okay, shh. We'll be very, very quiet.
Shh. Quiet.
who the hell do you think you are,
bringing marijuana into my house?
is this the care package from your friend, which i signed for?
Yeah, lighten up, uncle Fritz. - What, "lighten up"?
"lighten up"?!
you drugged your aunt without her permission, you know?
and if I had eaten one of these,
do you have any idea what could have happened?
do you?
I am in A. A. You want me to lighten up?
that's your response?
it's not my fault you're a drunk.
I've had enough of you.
what are you doing?
Hey, you know, I was the one who thought you should stay here.
did you know that?
huh? did you?
you said you got that package sent to you from a friend named Amy. - Give me
Yeah, here's the text. - What are you doing?
Hey. Oh, great, yeah, yeah,
here's her mobile phone and her home phone.
wait, what are you doing?! - I'm calling
listen, get to your room right now!
right now, and pack your bags!
you are going home as soon as I can make arrangements!
what's the fuss? - Charlie's leaving.
huh? - We're sending her back, Brenda.
sending her back?
I -- hello?
Mrs. Mannon?
this is agent Fritz Howard of the FBI.
I'm Charlie Johnson's uncle. We need to talk.
what's all the screaming?
and yelling?
and carrying on?
morning, Sergeant. - Ugh.
you all right, Chief?
Oh, last night, I
I had...strange dreams.
sergeant, does this mean anything to you
"send back"?
send back.
no. No, it doesn't.
chief, look, Mrs. Dobson is here in your office.
but it still smells like... her son's body.
Oh, my.
Hello, Mrs. Dobson.
how can I help you today, ma'am?
well, you asked if we had any information about Doug.
I do. I just...
I couldn't give it to you in front of my husband.
he forbids me to even speak of Doug.
is that why you didn't report your son missing?
you're that afraid of your husband?
I'm afraid enough not to tell him
that Doug keeps in touch with me.
in touch how?
Doug's been writing me...
until about five months ago.
I wanted to show these to you.
but I couldn't let my husband see them.
he was in Hawaii for some time, Doug was.
and, um, he moved to Australia to surf.
and, uh...
that's why i never reported him missing
cause I thought that I knew where he was.
I was able to verify the postage cancellations on Mrs. Dobson's letters -- they're genuine.
thank you.
last one was sent five months ago
by a man who, according to Terrence,
has been dead for three years.
you rang?
Oh, geez.
Yes, I did...
rang.
Why?
Oh! I know why.
I have evidence that contradicts your conclusion
based entirely on newspapers
that Doug Courtney died May 21, 2006.
well, I appreciate your candor, ma'am, but let me respectfully say that you're wrong.
I've completed the autopsy on Doug Courtney,
and I'm finally able to give you the results.
Oh.
in his stomach, I found two hot dogs
and malt-liquor residue, which, if you recall,
is exactly what was on the receipt found in the victim's wallet,
a receipt that was dated May 21, 2006,
the same date as the newspapers which constituted his shroud!
so, if you wish to find fault with my professional opinion,
I'd be more than happy to send Mr. box back to you,
and you can figure it out your-- "send it back"!
that's it.
"send it back." That's it!
Oh, Dr. Terrence, thank you!
thank you so much! Thank you!
okay, thanks. Thank you. Thank you.
thank you. Thank you. [ paper slapping ]
that's great. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
detective Sanchez. [ clears throat ]
I need some clear plastic sheets and, uh, duct tape.
on it, Chief. - Thank you.
uh, Sergeant Gabriel, I need four coolers
like the one in which we found Mr. Courtney.
you got it, Chief.
and, uh, Lieutenant Tao,
I would like to speak to you and Buzz in the electronics room, please.
chief, what are you thinking?
I'm thinking that whoever killed Doug Courtney
is gonna be very surprised when he pays them a visit.
Oh, god. [ coughs ]
Oh, please tell me we haven't been sent
four more dead bodies.
no, sir, this is all part of a plan to catch Mr. Courtney's killer.
testing, testing, one, two, three, testing.
that's a good test!
we're ready, Chief!
okay, thank you, Lieutenant, gentlemen.
um, explain, please?
each cooler contains a GPS system and a camera.
we're sending one cooler to each of our suspects
Mr. Courtney's parents, his ex-girlfriend,
his ex-landlord, and his former best friend.
whoever opens the cooler...
which we can monitor from here.
...is innocent.
right, because why would you open the box if you knew it contained a dead body?
so, whoever doesn't open it is probably guilty.
exactly, and will probably try to get rid of it...
which is where our trackers
and our GPS receiver come into play.
and this is all within budget?
uh, yes, it's the last of Buzz's grant money.
unless I can return this stuff when we're done.
let's seal it up.
anything new?
no. No.
and, uh, other than our friend Mr. Gaviota here,
we're sure that the coolers were all delivered?
positive.
we got confirmation for each one as they were dropped off.
[ sighs ] is it just me, or is this taking forever?
chief Johnson, we have something.
Oh. Flynn: I knew it!
all right, gentlemen, pay up.
is all this betting necessary? - Uh, no, ma'am.
but it makes staring at blank screens for three hours
a hell of a lot more interesting.
we have a runner!
who is it, Lieutenant? - Uh, Mr. Wallace.
Oh. Okay, but the Dobson's haven't opened their cooler yet,
so we can't rule them out as suspects.
uh, Lieutenant Tao,
find out what we don't know about Mr. Wallace, please.
I'm particularly interested in motive.
buzz, would you continue to watch for the Dobson's' cooler?
the rest of us, let's, uh, head out.
Oh, um, I don't want a murder suspect
looking at a Crown Vic in the rearview mirror.
what kind of car do you drive?
a Prius. why?
Oh, no, no, no, we
we'll take such good care of it. I promise.
but it's brand-new, and I just washed it.
such good care.
thank you very much.
just -- just please don't bring it back
with any blood in it or bullet holes.
hmm.
good luck. Thanks.
what are the main reasons for murder?
well, the main reasons for murder
are jealousy, revenge, and profit.
or just because.
Oh, looks like he stopped.
okay, uh, take the next exit, please.
in Mr. Wallace's case, jealousy seems unlikely.
well, the one thing we do know is that it wasn't for profit.
all Courtney had to his name was that Camaro
and what was in it.
surfing gear, lottery tickets.
Oh, and the $6, 500 transferred to his account from the offshore bank.
Hi, Fritzy, it's me.
Hey, I was just about to call you.
I wanted to talk to you about the tickets.
what tickets?
plane tickets for Charlie. I just bought them.
she's got a 7: 00 p. m. flight tomorrow out of L. A. X.
well, Fritzy, I want to talk about, uh, different travel dates.
uh, d-do you have a minute?
no, no, no, no, we'll -- we'll talk about it tonight.
okay. Okay, thank you.
okay, bye.
Mr. Wallace told us he ran a global real-estate company,
and I just had Fritz confirm with customs where he's been traveling Hawaii, Peru, Australia, new Zealand.
all places Mrs. Dobson got letters from.
exactly.
Oh. Oh, okay.
lieutenant Tao?
chief, Mr. Dobson opened up his cooler.
so we're following the right person.
and I think I know why.
on May 19, 2006,
Doug Courtney's numbers hit the lottery.
but Jordan Wallace was the one who cashed in the ticket
for $15 million.
sounds like motive to me.
all right, thank you, Lieutenant.
you're welcome.
okay.
Oh, god, he's right up there.
okay.
the car has a battery-power-only mode.
so we can roll up as quiet as possible.
when you're in a hole this big, Mr. Wallace,
my advice is to stop digging.
put the shovel down on the ground now.
do it now!
keep your hands where I can see them,
and step out of the hole.
what you got in the cooler, sir?
I'm guessing if we open it, Sergeant,
we're gonna find someone we've been looking for.
isn't that right, Mr. Wallace?
it's him. I think we found Mr. Courtney.
sir, you are under arrest.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you by the state.
have you heard and understood these rights, sir?
normally, Mr. Wallace, I like murderers to confess,
but since I found you
digging a grave in the desert in the middle of the night,
I feel like I already have your number
all six of them, actually.
what?
lottery numbers.
you do remember them, don't you,
the ones that made you a millionaire?
I'm sure we'd all love to hear them.
uh, 1...
uh, 1...
how about 1, 3, 11...
odd that you can't remember the six numbers
that changed your life.
computer picked them, okay? They were random.
it's not like they had any meaning.
they did to Doug Courtney.
they were his and his parents' birthdays,
and he played them twice a week for years.
and then in may 2006
may 19th, to be exact.
may 19th, those numbers hit,
and Mr. Courtney won $15 million.
and when he told you about it, you killed him,
and stole the winning ticket to claim it as your own. - No. No.
you murdered your own best friend for money! - No, that's a mistake!
Really?
when we examine this duct tape, whose fingerprints and DNA will we find on it, sir?
whose...
Gabriel: Yeah, whose foreign bank account will we find
was transferring money to Doug Courtney's checking account
to pay for the storage facility where you placed his body?
and the letters, of course? You -- the -- the letters?
you remember the letters.
the letters to Doug's mother, letters from
from Hawaii, Australia...
Peru, New Zealand -- all places Doug wanted to go,
all places she thought he might be.
well, the interesting thing is
that we can match the stamps from these letters to the stamps in your passport.
and the DNA that we get from the saliva
probably won't hurt our case, either.
but what's really contemptible, sir,
is the false hope you gave to Doug's mother.
how could you be so cruel?
"Cruel"? [ chuckles ]
you thought that was cruel.
I gave court's mom something he never did
a little attention, a second thought!
so, before you lecture me on cruelty,
let me tell you a little something
about your so-called victim.
he bought his winning lottery ticket with money he borrowed from me!
that was my $15 million!
and he was just gonna walk away with it,
to the nearest casino and throw it all away,
just like he did everything else!
money like that -- that was life-changing.
it changed my life.
it certainly did. It turned you into a killer.
detective Sanchez.
hands behind your back.
Hey, Gabriel.
you even had me believing that there was a body in there.
[ Chuckles ] Good job.
Gabriel: So, uh... [clears throat] Chief,
I, uh, just want to say thanks
for your support with all this.
thank you, Detective Sergeant.
well, I still have to pass the test.
I think you already did.
Oh, poor Buzz!
is that a dent? [ chuckles ]
I'm so sorry for your loss.
I... I remember you told me
that Doug said he wanted to pay you back for all the trouble that he put you through.
before your son died, he came into some money
$15 million, to be exact.
$15 million? wh
as soon as the court
confirms that that money actually belonged to him,
it will go to his next of kin, which is you,
and only you.
you might...
want to use this money to stand up for yourself.
but...
it won't
won't bring my son back, will it?
God.
I gave up on my own son.
how does a mother do that
give up on a child?
Hello, Charlie. Is Fritz here?
Hey. You coming with us?
uh, to the airport? No.
Charlie, uh, take your bags,
get back into your room, and unpack.
you're not going anywhere.
uh, yes, she is.
I'm not unpacking. I'm going home.
I don't want to be here anymore.
I said take your bags, go back into your bedroom,
and unpack -- or you and your pot-mailing friend
can have a big time out with the federal justice system
for the illegal transport of a controlled substance.
you want to be arrested? do you?
and still no apology?!
Brenda, I have had it with her.
you're the one who said she could stay.
one week. It's up.
she's inconsiderate. She is difficult.
she's completely self-centered.
she's disrespectful.
she's 16. What else would she be?
if you can't handle this...
you're the one who wants kids.
I want to be ignored and alienated by my own children,
not someone else's.
she's going home tonight.
we can't give up on her... like her parents have.
like my parents have.
if she leaves now and gets in trouble again...
I think we ought to hold on to her
for a little while longer...
...just so she knows she has someone
that she can rely on.
which is exactly what a good mother would say.
I don't know about that.
would you really have arrested her?
no.
I would have let you do it. [ sighs ]
is this gonna be your attitude the whole day? 'Cause it is really irritating.
I'm not talking to you until I get my iPod and phone back.
well, that's not happening until you apologize.
I apologized to uncle Fritz, and he accepted my apology.
well, you didn't apologize to me yet, which shouldn't be that hard to do considering I told you exactly what I want to hear.
I'm sorry, aunt Brenda, for drugging you with the pot brownies I made and for putting uncle Fritz in a terrible position.
I'm not feeling it. - Oh, my god, forget it. I don't care.
well, you better care, because if I don't start believing that you've developed a thought in your head for anyone other than yourself, then when grandpa comes to pick you up next week
Hey, watch out!
why are all these people running?
Charlie, don't open your window! - What's happening?
somebody's shooting in the parking lot!
you know you're in the red zone, right?
the red zone is for police.
I am the red zone. Keep your head down.
stay in the ca-- down!
stay in the car.
help me, please. Please, help.
I'm a police officer. What's your name?
uh, Jake.
Oh, god.
I-I-I think -- I think I'm shot.
I-I'm bleeding.
okay, Jake, don't move.
I want you to take this sweater and press it against your belly, okay? Like that.
okay. - Good.
do you know who shot you?
uh, no.
was it a boy or a girl?
uh, I-I-I-I think it was a boy.
okay.
Oh, god, please, please don't leave me!
no, I -- please, please.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere.
I just want to make sure that the ambulance knows where you are, okay?
okay. - Okay.
I told you to wait in the car!
I didn't hear anything, so I thought I'd come over here.
I brought you your -- your bag and your phone.
Hey, someone -- somebody needs to call my mom.
don't worry, don't worry. Someone is gonna call your mom.
Freeze! - Don't you worry.
deputy Chief Johnson.
I've got two down -- one dead and one under the car.
I want a four-block perimeter and field-interview cards on every person that you stop.
Yes, ma'am. - And get that ambulance back here.
got it. - Lieutenant.
his mother's name is Patricia Burrell.
she's a flight attendant for Royal Asian Airlines.
thank you. Officer, come with me.
I'm riding with Jake.
I want you to take this young lady and follow the ambulance to the hospital in my car.
you wait for me in the E. R. . and you don't let her out of your sight, do you understand?
Yes, ma'am.
okay, I'm right here, Jake.
I'm with you the whole way.
is -- is my -- is my mom coming?
Yes, she is, just as soon as possible.
S-sorry about the sweater.
don't you worry about that.
I promise I'll be here the minute you wake up.
keys. - Thank you.
is he gonna make it?
it's hard to know.
sit there and don't move.
lieutenant, did you locate Jake's mother?
well, we know that she's on the way to Hanoi.
we just haven't been able to, uh, get in touch with her yet.
did Jake say anything before the doctors took him?
no.
gentlemen, can we...
did you I. D. the victim yet?
uh, yes.
uh... his name is... Tomas Deleon, uh, age 17.
he died with a backpack full of pot.
so he's a drug dealer. - Looks like it.
so that might make that boy in surgery one of his customers.
were they victims of a robbery?
well, if it was, it didn't go very well.
Tomas had a big roll of cash on him, mostly small bills.
any other witnesses?
Um...well, yeah, a couple of people said they saw someone with a gun.
Really? Who?
a woman in a brown dress with blond curly hair.
that's horrible.
well, not completely.
one of the witnesses described you as being in your early 30s.
excuse me, gentlemen.
did you see where -- she was right here.
Charlie: Do you have change for a soda?
I told you not to move!
I had to go to the bathroom. - I don't care!
and when I say stay in the car, I mean stay in the car.
I could have shot you!
I was trying to help. - I didn't ask for your help.
how was I supposed -- don't you interrupt me!
I have to get to work.
since you seem to be so interested in how this boy is doing, - You can stay here with him when he gets out of surgery. - What?
call me the second he wakes up. - Why me?
I'm giving you the chance to show that you can care about someone other than yourself for a few minutes, someone with real problems.
so sit here and think about how lucky you are that you're out here and not in there.
our dead boy is Tomas Deleon.
and our eyewitness, Jake Burrell, is in emergency surgery and might not make it.
we need to be ready to do this without him.
what was going on in that parking lot?
drugs.
obviously.
all this pot was from our victim, Tomas Deleon's, backpack.
chief, if this is the start of a turf war, you need narcotics involved.
they know the players.
you're right, commander. If that's what this is, we need to be prepared.
was the dead boy in a gang?
no.
his older brother, Oscar Deleon, was.
served three years for distribution, out for two months.
well, maybe big brother was using little brother to keep his own nose clean.
Gabriel: Or to keep it from getting blown off by another gang.
how many shots were fired?
we found five 9mm casings spaced about 1 to 2 feet apart.
looks like the killer was shooting on the move.
and the car our witness Jake was hiding under -- turns out it's registered to Tomas.
we're towing it to the print shed.
okay. Let's do the notification for the Deleon family here and see if we can have his brother, Oscar, present.
sure, chief.
maybe he can tell us who would want his little brother dead.
that's not Tomas' backpack. I never saw it before.
you see it before?
no.
is this your little brother's backpack?
Tomas is a good boy, never any trouble.
I see.
when was the last time you saw your son?
this morning, around 9: 00.
he had breakfast, and he was worried about being late for his job.
Really? And where...is his job?
it's in a...coffee place somewhere in Hollywood. I'm not sure.
I'm sorry. You arrested the wrong boy.
tell me, how does a boy working in a coffee shop make $800 in tips before noon?
we -- we told you -- this is not, um -- it's not his backpack.
can you identify his car?
Yes, that's...his.
hmm, well, when Tomas bought his new car last month, somehow he paid for it in cash.
no, he said he got a loan. - No.
he was selling drugs. And I want to know who he was working for.
any ideas, Oscar?
I got no ideas.
all right, then.
Mr. and Mrs. Deleon, Oscar, it is my sad duty to inform you hat your son, - Tomas, was shot and killed... - No!
...in a parking lot behind a school where he was selling
you should have been the one who was dead!
you got him killed!
you got him killed! - I wasn't there!
all right, all right! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy! Easy! Easy!
you should have never gotten out of jail! I wish they never let you go!
where do you think you're going?
let him go...Detective.
we have nothing to hold him on.
at the moment.
I had to leave her at the hospital.
I thought we agreed Charlie needs constant supervision.
look, I promised my witness he wouldn't be alone.
Charlie seemed to show some interest in him, so I thought, why not give her the responsibility of looking in on the boy?
it might help her to grow up a little.
but unlike you, Brenda, she doesn't deal with death all the time.
she just saw two kids bleeding out on the pavement.
did you ever stop and think that leaving her in an emergency room by herself might not be the best idea in the world?
no, I thought now she'd get to see what happens when a drug deal goes wrong.
so what? This is your own little scared-straight program?
why not lock her in county for the night?
I should have heard from her by now.
I'm gonna call her, tell her to meet us downstairs.
Oh, no.
you left her at the hospital without her phone.
I thought we agreed after she apologized to me, you'd give it back to her.
well, she didn't apologize to me... properly.
I mean, she started to, but then she was -- I don't know -- pouting.
well, he's through surgery and already out of anesthesia and talking to his sister, so that's good.
his sister?
Oh, yeah. She's been glued to him.
okay, uh, l-let me see my face.- Okay.
Oh, god, my hair.
don't worry. You look great.
Really?
okay, that's enough for now.
he needs to rest.
uh, be right there.
I have to go.
I have, um, other... uh... patients to see, so, nice to meet you.
Yeah, uh, w-will you come back?
of course. As soon as I can.
I just have to... check the schedule.
it's good to see you up and, um...
excuse me just a second, just -- just one moment.
I have to check the schedule?
he thinks I'm a youth volunteer.
and the nurses think you're his sister?
they only allow family members in the I. C. U.
thank god I heard you use his mom's name.
obviously, Jake knows I'm not his sister, so I told him I was a youth volunteer.
it's easier than explaining you're my aunt.
you two are so related.
I told you to call me the second he woke up.
you wouldn't give me back my phone.
did he say anything about what happened in the parking lot?
no.
I was trying to make him feel better.
I'm not a narc.
okay, I think Charlie here has fulfilled her responsibilities pretty well, - wouldn't you say, honey? - Yes. I would.
thank you. Thank you very much, Charlie.
I promised him a playlist.
if that's designed to get your iPod back, it's not working.
you know what -- Hey, you really want to punish her?
what do you say I take this volunteer down to the cafeteria?
I understand the pizza's horrible.
thank you, uncle Fritz.
th-- there was this -- there was this flash.
and his head just went...
I-I hit -- I hit the ground.
so he was shot first.
did you see the person shooting?
no. He -- he was behind the other guy that got shot.
all -- all I did was get under the car.
did you know Tomas Deleon, the guy who was killed?
or what he was doing in that parking lot?
Jake, we didn't find any drugs on you, and I have no evidence that you were buying.
the way I see it, you've got enough trouble.
I'm only interested in the person who was shooting.
can you describe him for me?
I-I-I never -- I never saw his face.
the shooting started, and I went under the car, and then the shooting stopped.
and when I looked, I just -- I saw someone walking away.
and t-the next person I saw was you.
please don't tell my mom why I was there.
her only worry is that you get better, believe me.
you talked to her?
Yes, I did.
is she coming?
she is coming just as fast as that plane can fly.
I'm sure she told the captain to step on it.
you're gonna be okay.
okay?
we've got him pumped full of antibiotics at the moment.
large intestine was perforated, so infection is a big concern.
if he makes it through tomorrow night, he's got a chance.
how many bullets did you recover?
no complete bullets, only fragments.
fragments?
shrapnel, basically.
he had multiple entrance wounds. The bullets hit something and shattered before entering his body.
surgically speaking, that's a little more challenging.
right, right. Yes, I understand.
thank you. Thank you.
uh, Lieutenant Tao?
I think we can explain the shrapnel.
these chalk lines represent the parking space where Jake Burrell was shot.
sanchez: We went back and did lead wipes on some chips in the pavement and found three bullet impact points.
well, that's three bullets, but I remember five casings.
let's do a count.
Lord. All right.
uh, uh, the coroner found one bullet in the dead boy.
Jake dives under the S. U. V. And the shooter fires bullets 2 and 3...
pow, pow!
...which hit here and here, and bullet 4... - Pow!
...which hits here, further up.
all strike the pavement, creating shrapnel as Jake is backing up, striking him in the abdomen.
to here, where his blood pools.
at which point, the shooter lowers himself for a better angle, aiming for a head shot.
however, the bullet does not hit the pavement... does not strike Jake.
it hits the gas tank.
Oh, I sense a big finish coming up.
it lands... in...a brick of weed packed inside this half of this fake gas tank.
but if this was all about drugs and his S. U. V. was loaded with marijuana, why didn't they just drive away with it?
right. And what decent gangster leaves $800 behind?
you know, you could have spared me this dog-and-pony show and just told me out front that the shooter fired once at Deleon and four times at Jake Burrell.
chief. - I wanted to give you the full picture!
uh, chief, we -- we need to go back to the hospital.
no, no, no, no, no.
we think Jake was the target all along.
buzz, do you think you could place a camera and a microphone in an I. C.U. Room without being noticed?
sure. I've got some new wireless units that are pretty small, and I could probably put them on an I. V.
stand without anyone notic-- Great.
pack up your away kit, and be ready to go in five minutes. Thank you.
sergeant, I want clearance from the hospital to put a video feed in Jake Burrell's room.
I'm guessing they won't like that.
tell them we're afraid for his safety if you have to.
chief, you gonna interview the boy again?
I don't think so, Lieutenant.
you said you promised Jake some music?
yeah?
he's all alone.
I think it would be good for him.
what about my phone?
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
that's, uh... that's cool.
Really?
well, it's, uh, kind of girly.
Yeah, you can't really dance to it, I guess.
Hey, h-how long can you stay today?
a while. Why?
Oh, um...my mom doesn't get in till tomorrow, so I'm a little on my own.
I'll -- I'll try and stay, then.
Thanks.
Oh...my god.
my mom... - I've made up my mind.
I'm gonna ask Lauren to marry me.
...they gave her the phone in the airport in Hanoi, - and she was all freaking out and stuff. - I'm going to ask her.
I think she might even be mad at me.
she'll get over it when she sees you.
you'll be better tomorrow.
I hope she doesn't find out I was buying pot.
what is it with parents and pot?
it's like none of them ever tried it.
I don't think pot's that big of a deal.
are you okay?
Yeah. Um...
it just kind of hurts a little bit.
Hey, look, you know, if...if you have other patients -- I don't.
I mean, it's slow today, so...
well, what -- what about, um...
do you, like, do this volunteer thing, uh, alone, - or...does your boyfriend do it with you sometimes? - Oh, no.
I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
we broke up a few months ago.
okay, yeah, s-same here.
A-actually, you know, I got dumped.
Why?
it was intense, you know?
like, at first... we weren't, you know, uh, hooking up a lot.
then once we did, It was like -- it was like you had to do it all the time?
Yeah.
with my boyfriend, it was like every day, everywhere.
like, you know, "what about... your parents' bedroom?
um... your parents' bedroom?
Why? - I don't know.
I guess it just...
sort of became more about him than us, and then it's hard to go back.
no.
I guess with the right person, though, it could be... - Oh, totally.
...Different. - Totally.
Yeah, I don't know.
I-I... I may, uh, never even find out.
uh, Vanessa is... m-my girlfriend's name.
um... she got, uh, pregnant.
Oh, my god.
Yeah, so I'm going to be a father.
Oh, my god. And she dumped you?
I-I told her, like, we could get married, or, you know, I-I'd help her...
...that we could find a way to take care of the kid so it wouldn't...
grow up without a father... like I did.
but vanessa -- she told me she never wanted to see me again.
Why?
she didn't know what to say to her dad.
she -- she kept wanting to, like, hide everything that was going on.
but she started to show, I guess, because a couple weeks ago,
I got a phone call from her father saying that if he ever saw me hanging around his daughter again, that he'd kill me.
so I -- I guess I did something wrong.
I-I've messed up a lot this year.
stop there, Buzz.
all right.
narcotics has given you a list of Oscar Deleon's enemies.
the victim was dealing drugs.
Yeah. What -- what happened to the drugs?
and she wants to throw all that out for teen pregnancy.
Why? - The shooter only hit Tomas once.
he shot at Jake four times.
I think this pregnant girlfriend could be a much stronger motive than the pot.
well, that's too bad, then, because even if Jake was the target, you had no permission to make this recording.
this girl is my niece, and she's a witness.
I had every right to record her for...her own protection.
are you her legal guardian?
well, no. - Then you cannot act on her behalf.
anything you use from this interview would be fruit of the poisonous tree.
okay, fine.
if I can't use this DVD, I'll use what's on it.
but you'll have to get the information from some other source.
and don't you worry -- I have a great one.
pardon me.
Fritz: You couldn't have liked that.
I didn't. But the pizza -- it couldn't have -- it was too mushy.
it was mushy, exactly.
this is fantastic. - Hello!
Oh, hey, honey, there you are!
Hey, listen, we were kind of waiting for you, but it's completely my fault.
look -- Swiss steak.
that's so nice.
Charlie made dinner again.
Oh, well, thank you, Charlie.
here, you got to taste some. Here you go.
Thanks.
Oh, and you've got to have some of these potatoes. They're amazing.
I think it was good for Jake to spend all that time with you today, don't you?
I guess.
I'm sure he enjoyed the music.
and I imagine he told you more about his life and things like that.
cause I'm -- I'm worried about him -- Jake.
Why?
uh... I have reason to believe that his life is in danger.
it seemed like he was getting better to me.
no, I-I'm not talking about the injuries.
I'm saying that I no longer believe that Jake was just a witness.
I-I think he was the principal target.
Really? Why are we talking about that?
because of the physical evidence, which is why, Charlie...
...if Jake said anything to you today about his life that might be a reason for someone to want to hurt him
he didn't.
no?
nothing at all?
Nope.
what about his girlfriend -- Vanessa?
how did you know about
you spied on me, didn't you?
no. I taped you.
Brenda, you can't put Charlie in the middle of this.
she's been in the middle from the very beginning.
look... if you don't want to repeat your conversation with Jake, this is a prepared statement where you confirm that Jake told you about getting his girlfriend, Vanessa, pregnant.
and you are going to sign it. - No. I'm not signing anything.
okay.
this is a DVD -- a recording of everything you said in that hospital room
about the pot, about what you did in your parents' bedroom with your boyfriend.
Oh...my god.
it's all going directly to your address, FedEx.
you wouldn't do that. - Brenda!
I'm trying to protect this boy's life.
she's trying to protect his secrets.
which do you think is more important?
you are the most horrible person I have ever met!
tell the world that.
sign the paper, get your cellphone back.
and you can call everyone you know and tell them what a monster I am for trying to stop someone from killing Jake.
or I gift wrap this DVD and send it to your parents -- your choice.
recording me.
I'm only doing this to protect Jake!
no one believes that, including you.
including me.
I had to do this to legally close my case.
and this was the only way to do that?
I didn't lie to her.
aunt Brenda, quick! We have to go to the hospital right now!
Charlie, wait, wait. Are you okay?
Yeah. I called Jake, and I told him everything about who I am and about how you spied on us and everything!
Charlie, slow down, slow down. - What did you do?
wait, hush, hush, hush. What did you do?
I-I called Jake, and he sounded awful.
I -- he had this really bad fever, and the nurses made him get off the phone!
okay. I'm -- I'm going to get my clothes on.
no, Charlie!
no, it will only take a second! - Charlie, no, no, wait.
I-I told him I was coming!
well, you shouldn't have done that. - He's not gonna talk to you!
I told him everything you did!
well, you shouldn't have done that, either! - You have to let me see him!
okay, all right, all right.
look, Charlie -- where is my purse?
I'll find your purse. I'll find your purse.
stay here.
you said yourself that I'm in the middle of this.
Charlie, I promise you -- I will do everything I can to help this boy.
she's telling you the truth.
what's gonna happen to him?
as soon as I find out, I will call you.
thank you.
drive carefully, all right?
what now?
now I wait up with you.
doctor, um, I'm sorry.
I just need to know if Jake can handle being interviewed at the moment?
we got him maxed out on morphine, so he'll be in and out.
do you know if he spoke to his mother yet?
half an hour ago.
she's on a plane coming in from Honolulu, but she's still about three hours away.
he's never gonna last that long.
uh, chief, chief.
uh, we don't technically need it, but considering that, uh, we taped him without his permission yesterday
right. I'll ask.
okay.
mom... mom.
mom, you -- y-you made it.
no, no, Jake, it's -- it's me, Brenda, from the police.
but your mom's coming.
she'll be here any minute.
is, uh -- is -- is Charlie here?
uh, no. No.
but she told me to tell you that she's thinking about you.
now, Jake, I'm -- I'm sorry, but I have to record our conversation.
all right, then?
you're asking me this time?
Yes. I am -- I'm sorry about that.
that's okay.
now, I'm gonna keep this short, but I want to ask you again
do you remember anything else about the shooting?
no. No.
you said that you saw someone leaving and -- and that it was a boy and not a girl.
how -- how did you know that?
I, um...
I-I saw his -- his feet...
as he was running away
his... hiking boots... uh, tan.
tan hiking boots. That's good. That's very, very good.
did, uh, y-you talk to my mom?
I-I did. I did.
and she told me to tell you that she loves you very, very much.
she knows more than you realize.
she knows all about... the problem that you had with your... girlfriend.
what's -- what's her name?
Vanessa Almassian -- right.
she knows all about that, and she doesn't care at all.
she loves you just the same.
so there is nothing to worry about.
that's -- that's good.
uh, good morning, Sergeant.
well, it's 4: 14 A. M. to be exact.
Yeah.
I want you to look up a name -- Vanessa Almassian.
I don't know.
probably a-l-m-a-s-i-a-n, maybe two s's.
Yes, Sergeant, now. Huh? Huh?
mom -- mommy?
mama. Mom.
n
y-yes, Jake, what is it?
you made it.
Yes, I made it.
I knew you would make it.
mommy.
I'm so sorry.
no.
don't be sorry.
I love you no matter what.
so much -- so much trouble, though.
no. No, no, no.
no trouble at all.
you sure?
I'm positive.
positive.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
sorry. - Thanks.
I spoke with Sergeant Gabriel.
he called back with a hit on the name Almassian.
Really? From where?
from an interview card from the crime scene.
there was actually somebody there with that last name.
and we've got an address.
and they're getting a search warrant.
so -- so why don't you sit down - and just take it easy? - No, no, no.
I have to go downstairs and wait for Jake's mother.
I can do that.
I can do that.
so, sit... catch your breath.
Flynn's gonna drop by and pick you up as soon as they get the warrant.
okay.
Oh, I'm fine, really.
take it.
you never know.
gentlemen, do we know if the Almassians are home?
well, the father's due at work in about -- uh, about an hour.
best guess is the son and daughter are still inside.
here's the, uh, interview card from the crime scene.
okay. Thank you.
sergeant, let's make sure that all the exits are covered while I'm inside.
we got it, Chief.
gentlemen, would you please stay out of sight for the moment?
let's see how many answers I can get before I invite y'all inside.
Mr. Almassian? - Yes?
I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson of the L. A. P. D.
I need to ask you some questions, sir.
I'm on my way to work.
do you know a young man by the name of Jake Burrell?
you need to talk to my daughter.
Vanessa, this is -- I'm sorry?
deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, the L. A. P. D.
she wants to know about Jake.
so what happened? He rape another girl?
dad! - I told you we should call the cops.
now look -- he's done it again!
now, this is a serious matter, Vanessa.
I expect a serious answer.
did Jake rape you?
don't look at him! Look at me! Did he rape you?
tell her what you told me and your brother.
I see you're pregnant.
Yeah.
is Jake Burrell the father?
Yeah.
tell her what happened!
go ahead, Vanessa, tell me what happened.
no.
she would rather bring shame to her whole family.
Mr. Almassian, do you own a gun?
Yeah. What's that got to do with anything?
where is it? Where is it?
it's in the top drawer of that table by the front door.
I think you should tell me what's going on!
okay.
we have a warrant to search your house.
you have a warrant?!
here's what you do -- you cooperate.
do you understand me?! You cooperate!
you think you're ashamed now?
wait till I take you and your pregnant daughter to jail in front of the neighbors.
just give me a reason!
chief.
is there anyone else in the house besides the two of you, sir?
my son, Alex. He's sleeping.
tao: Sir, I think you and your daughter should grab a chair and stay seated.
Mr. Almassian, where were you at 9: 00 yesterday morning?
I was at work. Call my boss.
and your daughter? - She was here.
what about your son? - He was here, too.
not according to this field-interview card.
an officer stopped your son yesterday two blocks from where a young man was shot and killed and Jake Burrell was fatally wounded.
what? - What?
Jake died this morning from gunshot wounds.
chief!
look what I found in one of the bedrooms!
Mr. Almassian, where is your son?!
where is he?!
out front! He's running away!
get down!
get on the ground!
Hey, leave him alone! What's he done?!
stay back! - What's happening to Alex?!
we're arresting Alex for murder.
What?!
this is all your fault!
what -- what do you mean?
what did I do? - You're the one who got him so mad!
but Jake raped you!
no, he didn't!
he didn't.
you called me a whore. What was I supposed to say?
how about the truth?
if you told the truth from the beginning, Jake would still be alive!
it's over, chief. It's over.
no, it isn't.
I still have a notification to do.
come on. Get up.
is that her?
I think it is.
you told me you were gonna call. Why didn't you call?
uh, I'm sorry.
things got very busy, and, um... ...I ended up making an arrest.
Oh, so you found the guy who shot Jake.
I did. I did, thanks to Charlie.
I want to tell you that, because of your help and the way that you took care of Jake, we arrested the killer today.
Really? - Really.
but...
what happened to Jake?
in -- in gunshot wounds, there's always...
...there's always a serious chance of infection.
are you saying he died?
Yes, he did.
Charlie, I-I'm so sorry that I put you in such a terrible position.
I am so -- I should have been there.
there was nothing you could have done.
I could have said goodbye.
why didn't you let me say goodbye?
you kept me here when you knew he was dying.
you have every right to be angry.
you didn't even give me a chance.
I have not treated you properly. - Why didn't you give me a chance?
well -- well, let me -- let me answer you.
let -- let me answer you.
I... Look, Jake
he was in very bad shape, and he had a very limited amount of time to talk, so I had to make a decision between...
finding out who killed him and -- and -- and letting you say goodbye, and I chose to find out who killed him.
did I make the right choice?
he...
he asked about you.
Charlie, he -- he knew you were his friend.
he knew that. He did ask about you.
I...
is this gonna be your attitude the whole day? 'Cause it is really irritating.
I'm not talking to you until I get my ipod and phone back.
well, that's not happening until you apologize.
I apologized to uncle Fritz, and he accepted my apology.
well, you didn't apologize to me yet, which shouldn't be that hard to do considering I told you exactly what I want to hear.
I'm sorry, aunt Brenda, for drugging you with the pot brownies I made and for putting uncle Fritz in a terrible position.
I'm not feeling it. - Oh, my god, forget it. I don't care.
well, you better care, because if I don't start believing that you've developed a thought in your head for anyone other than yourself, then when grandpa comes to pick you up next week
Hey, watch out!
why are all these people running?
Charlie, don't open your window! - What's happening?
somebody's shooting in the parking lot!
you know you're in the red zone, right?
the red zone is for police.
I am the red zone. Keep your head down.
stay in the car -- down!
stay in the car.
help me, please. Please, help.
I'm a police officer. What's your name?
uh, Jake.
Oh, god.
I-I-I think -- I think I'm shot.
I-I'm bleeding.
okay, Jake, don't move.
I want you to take this sweater and press it against your belly, okay? Like that.
okay. - Good.
do you know who shot you?
uh, no.
was it a boy or a girl?
uh, I-I-I-I think it was a boy.
okay.
Oh, god, please, please don't leave me!
no, I -- please, please.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere.
I just want to make sure that the ambulance knows where you are, okay?
okay. - Okay.
I told you to wait in the car!
I didn't hear anything, so I thought I'd come over here.
I brought you your -- your bag and your phone.
Hey, someone -- somebody needs to call my mom.
don't worry, don't worry. Someone is gonna call your mom.
Freeze! - Don't you worry.
deputy Chief Johnson.
I've got two down -- one dead and one under the car.
I want a four-block perimeter and field-interview cards on every person that you stop.
Yes, ma'am. - And get that ambulance back here.
got it. - Lieutenant.
his mother's name is Patricia Burrell.
she's a flight attendant for royal Asian airlines.
thank you. Officer, come with me.
I'm riding with Jake.
I want you to take this young lady and follow the ambulance to the hospital in my car.
you wait for me in the E.R. And you don't let her out of your sight, do you understand?
Yes, ma'am.
okay, I'm right here, Jake.
I'm with you the whole way.
is -- is my -- is my mom coming?
Yes, she is, just as soon as possible.
S-sorry about the sweater.
don't you worry about that.
I promise I'll be here the minute you wake up.
keys. - Thank you.
is he gonna make it?
it's hard to know.
sit there and don't move.
lieutenant, did you locate Jake's mother?
well, we know that she's on the way to Hanoi.
we just haven't been able to, uh, get in touch with her yet.
did Jake say anything before the doctors took him?
no.
gentlemen, can we...
did you I. D. the victim yet?
uh, yes.
uh... his name is... Tomas Deleon, uh, age 17.
he died with a backpack full of pot.
so he's a drug dealer. - Looks like it.
so that might make that boy in surgery one of his customers.
were they victims of a robbery?
well, if it was, it didn't go very well.
Tomas had a big roll of cash on him, mostly small bills.
any other witnesses?
Um...well, yeah, a couple of people said they saw someone with a gun.
Really? Who?
a woman in a brown dress with blond curly hair.
that's horrible.
well, not completely.
one of the witnesses described you as being in your early 30s.
excuse me, gentlemen.
did you see where -- she was right here.
Charlie: Do you have change for a soda?
I told you not to move!
I had to go to the bathroom. - I don't care!
and when I say stay in the car, I mean stay in the car.
I could have shot you!
I was trying to help. - I didn't ask for your help.
how was I supposed -- don't you interrupt me!
I have to get to work.
since you seem to be so interested in how this boy is doing, - you can stay here with him when he gets out of surgery. - What?
call me the second he wakes up. - Why me?
I'm giving you the chance to show that you can care about someone other than yourself for a few minutes, someone with real problems.
so sit here and think about how lucky you are that you're out here and not in there.
our dead boy is Tomas Deleon.
and our eyewitness, Jake Burrell, is in emergency surgery and might not make it.
we need to be ready to do this without him.
what was going on in that parking lot?
drugs.
obviously.
all this pot was from our victim, Tomas Deleon's, backpack.
chief, if this is the start of a turf war, you need narcotics involved.
they know the players.
you're right, commander. If that's what this is, we need to be prepared.
was the dead boy in a gang?
no.
his older brother, Oscar Deleon, was.
served three years for distribution, out for two months.
well, maybe big brother was using little brother to keep his own nose clean.
Gabriel: Or to keep it from getting blown off by another gang.
how many shots were fired?
we found five 9mm casings spaced about 1 to 2 feet apart.
looks like the killer was shooting on the move.
and the car our witness Jake was hiding under -- turns out it's registered to Tomas.
we're towing it to the print shed.
okay. Let's do the notification for the Deleon family here and see if we can have his brother, Oscar, present.
sure, chief.
maybe he can tell us who would want his little brother dead.
that's not Tomas' backpack. I never saw it before.
you see it before?
no.
is this your little brother's backpack?
Tomas is a good boy, never any trouble.
I see.
when was the last time you saw your son?
this morning, around 9: 00.
he had breakfast, and he was worried about being late for his job.
Really? And where...is his job?
it's in A...coffee place somewhere in hollywood. I'm not sure.
I'm sorry. You arrested the wrong boy.
tell me, how does a boy working in a coffee shop make $800 in tips before noon?
we -- we told you -- this is not, um -- it's not his backpack.
can you identify his car?
Yes, that's...his.
hmm, well, when Tomas bought his new car last month, somehow he paid for it in cash.
no, he said he got a loan. - No.
he was selling drugs. And I want to know who he was working for.
any ideas, Oscar?
I got no ideas.
all right, then.
mr.and Mrs. Deleon, Oscar, it is my sad duty to inform you hat your son, - Tomas, was shot and killed... - No!
...in a parking lot behind a school where he was selling
you should have been the one who was dead!
you got him killed!
you got him killed! - I wasn't there!
all right, all right! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy! Easy! Easy!
you should have never gotten out of jail! I wish they never let you go!
where do you think you're going?
let him go...detective.
at the moment. We have nothing to hold him on.
I had to leave her at the hospital.
I thought we agreed Charlie needs constant supervision.
look, I promised my witness he wouldn't be alone.
Charlie seemed to show some interest in him, so I thought, why not give her the responsibility of looking in on the boy?
it might help her to grow up a little.
but unlike you, Brenda, she doesn't deal with death all the time.
she just saw two kids bleeding out on the pavement.
did you ever stop and think that leaving her in an emergency room by herself might not be the best idea in the world?
no, I thought now she'd get to see what happens when a drug deal goes wrong.
so what? This is your own little scared-straight program?
why not lock her in county for the night?
I should have heard from her by now.
I'm gonna call her, tell her to meet us downstairs.
Oh, no.
you left her at the hospital without her phone.
I thought we agreed after she apologized to me, you'd give it back to her.
well, she didn't apologize to me... properly.
I mean, she started to, but then she was -- I don't know -- pouting.
well, he's through surgery and already out of anesthesia and talking to his sister, so that's good.
his sister?
Oh, yeah. She's been glued to him.
okay, uh, l-let me see my face.- Okay.
Oh, god, my hair.
don't worry. You look great.
Really?
okay, that's enough for now.
he needs to rest.
uh, be right there.
I have to go.
I have, um, other... uh... patients to see, so, nice to meet you.
Yeah, uh, w-will you come back?
of course. As soon as I can.
I just have to... check the schedule.
it's good to see you up and, um...
excuse me just a second, just -- just one moment.
I have to check the schedule?
he thinks I'm a youth volunteer.
and the nurses think you're his sister?
they only allow family members in the I. C.U.
thank god I heard you use his mom's name.
obviously, Jake knows I'm not his sister, so I told him I was a youth volunteer.
it's easier than explaining you're my aunt.
you two are so related.
I told you to call me the second he woke up.
you wouldn't give me back my phone.
did he say anything about what happened in the parking lot?
no.
I was trying to make him feel better.
I'm not a narc.
okay, I think Charlie here has fulfilled her responsibilities pretty well, - wouldn't you say, honey? - Yes. I would.
thank you. Thank you very much, Charlie.
I promised him a playlist.
if that's designed to get your ipod back, it's not working.
you know what -- Hey, you really want to punish her?
what do you say I take this volunteer down to the cafeteria?
I understand the pizza's horrible.
thank you, uncle Fritz.
th-- there was this -- there was this flash.
and his head just went...
I-I hit -- I hit the ground.
so he was shot first.
did you see the person shooting?
no. He -- he was behind the other guy that got shot.
all -- all I did was get under the car.
did you know Tomas Deleon, the guy who was killed?
or what he was doing in that parking lot?
Jake, we didn't find any drugs on you, and I have no evidence that you were buying.
the way I see it, you've got enough trouble.
I'm only interested in the person who was shooting.
can you describe him for me?
I-I-I never -- I never saw his face.
the shooting started, and I went under the car, and then the shooting stopped.
and when I looked, I just -- I saw someone walking away.
and t-the next person I saw was you.
please don't tell my mom why I was there.
her only worry is that you get better, believe me.
you talked to her?
Yes, I did.
is she coming?
she is coming just as fast as that plane can fly.
I'm sure she told the captain to step on it.
you're gonna be okay.
okay?
we've got him pumped full of antibiotics at the moment.
large intestine was perforated, so infection is a big concern.
if he makes it through tomorrow night, he's got a chance.
how many bullets did you recover?
no complete bullets, only fragments.
fragments?
shrapnel, basically.
he had multiple entrance wounds. The bullets hit something and shattered before entering his body.
surgically speaking, that's a little more challenging.
right, right. Yes, I understand.
thank you. Thank you.
uh, lieutenant Tao?
I think we can explain the shrapnel.
these chalk lines represent the parking space where Jake Burrell was shot.
sanchez: We went back and did lead wipes on some chips in the pavement and found three bullet impact points.
well, that's three bullets, but I remember five casings.
let's do a count.
Lord. All right.
uh, uh, the coroner found one bullet in the dead boy.
Jake dives under the S.U.V. And the shooter fires bullets 2 and 3...
pow, pow!
...which hit here and here, and bullet 4... - Pow!
...which hits here, further up.
all strike the pavement, creating shrapnel as Jake is backing up, striking him in the abdomen.
to here, where his blood pools.
at which point, the shooter lowers himself for a better angle, aiming for a head shot.
however, the bullet does not hit the pavement... does not strike Jake.
it hits the gas tank.
Oh, I sense a big finish coming up.
it lands... in...a brick of weed packed inside this half of this fake gas tank.
but if this was all about drugs and his S.U.V. was loaded with marijuana, why didn't they just drive away with it?
right. And what decent gangster leaves $800 behind?
you know, you could have spared me this dog-and-pony show and just told me out front that the shooter fired once at Deleon and four times at Jake Burrell.
chief. - I wanted to give you the full picture!
uh, chief, we -- we need to go back to the hospital.
no, no, no, no, no.
we think Jake was the target all along.
buzz, do you think you could place a camera and a microphone in an I.C.U. Room without being noticed?
sure. I've got some new wireless units that are pretty small, and I could probably put them on an I.V.
stand without anyone notic-- great.
pack up your away kit, and be ready to go in five minutes. Thank you.
sergeant, I want clearance from the hospital to put a video feed in Jake Burrell's room.
I'm guessing they won't like that.
tell them we're afraid for his safety if you have to.
chief, you gonna interview the boy again?
I don't think so, lieutenant.
you said you promised Jake some music?
yeah?
he's all alone.
I think it would be good for him.
what about my phone?
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
that's, uh... that's cool.
Really?
well, it's, uh, kind of girly.
Yeah, you can't really dance to it, I guess.
Hey, h-how long can you stay today?
awhile. Why?
Oh, um...my mom doesn't get in till tomorrow, so I'm a little on my own.
I'll -- I'll try and stay, then.
Thanks.
Oh...my god.
my mom... - I've made up my mind.
I'm gonna ask Lauren to marry me.
...they gave her the phone in the airport in Hanoi, - And she was all freaking out and stuff. - I'm going to ask her.
I think she might even be mad at me.
she'll get over it when she sees you.
you'll be better tomorrow.
I hope she doesn't find out I was buying pot.
what is it with parents and pot?
it's like none of them ever tried it.
I don't think pot's that big of a deal.
are you okay?
Yeah. Um...
it just kind of hurts a little bit.
Hey, look, you know, if...if you have other patients -- I don't.
I mean, it's slow today, so...
well, what -- what about, um...
do you, like, do this volunteer thing, uh, alone, - Or...does your boyfriend do it with you sometimes? - Oh, no.
I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
we broke up a few months ago.
okay, yeah, s-same here.
A-actually, you know, I got dumped.
Why?
it was intense, you know?
like, at first... we weren't, you know, uh, hooking up a lot.
then once we did, it was like -- it was like you had to do it all the time?
Yeah.
with my boyfriend, it was like every day, everywhere.
like, you know, "what about ... your parents' bedroom?"
um... your parents' bedroom?
Why? - I don't know.
I guess it just...
sort of became more about him than us, and then it's hard to go back.
no.
I guess with the right person, though, it could be... - Oh, totally.
...Different. - Totally.
Yeah, I don't know.
I-I... I may, uh, never even find out.
uh, Vanessa is... m-my girlfriend's name.
um... she got, uh, pregnant.
Oh, my god.
Yeah, so I'm going to be a father.
Oh, my god. And she dumped you?
I-I told her, like, we could get married, or, you know, I-I'd help her...
...that we could find a way to take care of the kid so it wouldn't...
grow up without a father... like I did.
but Vanessa -- she told me she never wanted to see me again.
Why?
she didn't know what to say to her dad.
she -- she kept wanting to, like, hide everything that was going on.
but she started to show, I guess, because a couple weeks ago,
I got a phone call from her father saying that if he ever saw me hanging around his daughter again, that he'd kill me.
so I -- I guess I did something wrong.
I-I've messed up a lot this year.
stop there, Buzz.
all right.
narcotics has given you a list of Oscar Deleon's enemies.
the victim was dealing drugs.
Yeah. What -- what happened to the drugs?
and she wants to throw all that out for teen pregnancy.
Why? - The shooter only hit Tomas once.
he shot at Jake four times.
I think this pregnant girlfriend could be a much stronger motive than the pot.
well, that's too bad, then, because even if jake was the target, you had no permission to make this recording.
this girl is my niece, and she's a witness.
I had every right to record her for...her own protection.
are you her legal guardian?
well, no. - Then you cannot act on her behalf.
anything you use from this interview would be fruit of the poisonous tree.
okay, fine.
if I can't use this DVD, I'll use what's on it.
but you'll have to get the information from some other source.
and don't you worry -- I have a great one.
pardon me.
Fritz: You couldn't have liked that.
I didn't. But the pizza -- it couldn't have -- it was too mushy.
it was mushy, exactly.
this is fantastic. - Hello!
Oh, hey, honey, there you are!
Hey, listen, we were kind of waiting for you, but it's completely my fault.
look -- Swiss steak.
that's so nice.
Charlie made dinner again.
Oh, well, thank you, Charlie.
here, you got to taste some. Here you go.
Thanks.
Oh, and you've got to have some of these potatoes. They're amazing.
I think it was good for Jake to spend all that time with you today, don't you?
I guess.
I'm sure he enjoyed the music.
and I imagine he told you more about his life and things like that.
cause I'm -- I'm worried about him -- Jake.
Why?
uh... I have reason to believe that his life is in danger.
it seemed like he was getting better to me.
no, I-I'm not talking about the injuries.
I'm saying that I no longer believe that Jake was just a witness.
I-I think he was the principal target.
Really? Why are we talking about that?
because of the physical evidence, which is why, Charlie...
...if Jake said anything to you today about his life that might be a reason for someone to want to hurt him
he didn't.
no?
nothing at all?
Nope.
what about his girlfriend -- Vanessa?
how did you know about
you spied on me, didn't you?
no. I taped you.
Brenda, you can't put Charlie in the middle of this.
she's been in the middle from the very beginning.
look... if you don't want to repeat your conversation with Jake, this is a prepared statement where you confirm that Jake told you about getting his girlfriend, Vanessa, pregnant.
and you are going to sign it. - No. I'm not signing anything.
okay.
this is a DVD -- a recording of everything you said in that hospital room
about the pot, about what you did in your parents' bedroom with your boyfriend.
Oh...my god.
it's all going directly to your address, FedEx'd.
you wouldn't do that. - Brenda!
I'm trying to protect this boy's life.
she's trying to protect his secrets.
which do you think is more important?
you are the most horrible person I have ever met!
tell the world that.
sign the paper, get your cellphone back.
and you can call everyone you know and tell them what a monster I am for trying to stop someone from killing Jake.
or I gift wrap this DVD and send it to your parents -- your choice.
recording me.
I'm only doing this to protect Jake!
no one believes that, including you.
including me.
I had to do this to legally close my case.
and this was the only way to do that?
I didn't lie to her.
aunt Brenda, quick! We have to go to the hospital right now!
Charlie, wait, wait. Are you okay?
Yeah. I called Jake, and I told him everything about who I am and about how you spied on us and everything!
Charlie, slow down, slow down. - What did you do?
wait, hush, hush, hush. What did you do?
I-I called Jake, and he sounded awful.
I -- he had this really bad fever, and the nurses made him get off the phone!
okay.- I'm -- I'm going to get my clothes on.
no, Charlie!
no, it will only take a second! - Charlie, no, no, wait.
I-I told him I was coming!
well, you shouldn't have done that. - He's not gonna talk to you!
I told him everything you did!
well, you shouldn't have done that, either! - You have to let me see him!
okay, all right, all right.
look, Charlie -- where is my purse?
I'll find your purse. I'll find your purse.
stay here.
you said yourself that I'm in the middle of this.
Charlie, I promise you -- I will do everything I can to help this boy.
she's telling you the truth.
what's gonna happen to him?
as soon as I find out, I will call you.
thank you.
drive carefully, all right?
what now?
now I wait up with you.
doctor, um, I'm sorry.
I just need to know if Jake can handle being interviewed at the moment?
we got him maxed out on morphine, so he'll be in and out.
do you know if he spoke to his mother yet?
half an hour ago.
she's on a plane coming in from Honolulu, but she's still about three hours away.
he's never gonna last that long.
uh, chief, chief.
uh, we don't technically need it, but considering that, uh, we taped him without his permission yesterday
right. I'll ask.
okay.
mom... mom.
mom, you -- y-you made it.
no, no, Jake, it's -- it's me, Brenda, from the police.
but your mom's coming.
she'll be here any minute.
is, uh -- is -- is charlie here?
uh, no. No.
but she told me to tell you that she's thinking about you.
now, Jake, I'm -- I'm sorry, but I have to record our conversation.
all right, then?
you're asking me this time?
Yes. I am -- I'm sorry about that.
that's okay.
now, I'm gonna keep this short, but I want to ask you again
do you remember anything else about the shooting?
no. No.
you said that you saw someone leaving and -- and that it was a boy and not a girl.
how -- how did you know that?
I, um...
I-I saw his -- his feet...
as he was running away
his... hiking boots... uh, tan.
tan hiking boots. That's good. That's very, very good.
did, uh, y-you talk to my mom?
I-I did. I did.
and she told me to tell you that she loves you very, very much.
she knows more than you realize.
she knows all about... the problem that you had with your... girlfriend.
what's -- what's her name?
Vanessa Almassian -- right.
she knows all about that, and she doesn't care at all.
she loves you just the same.
so there is nothing to worry about.
that's -- that's good.
uh, good morning, sergeant.
well, it's 4: 14 A.M. to be exact.
Yeah.
I want you to look up a name -- Vanessa Almassian.
I don't know.
probably a-l-m-a-s-I-a-n, maybe two s's.
Yes, sergeant, now. Huh? Huh?
mom -- mommy?
mama. Mom.
y-yes, Jake, what is it?
you made it.
Yes, I made it.
I knew you would make it.
mommy.
I'm so sorry.
no.
don't be sorry.
I love you no matter what.
so much -- so much trouble, though.
no. No, no, no.
no trouble at all.
you sure?
I'm positive.
positive.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
sorry. - Thanks.
I spoke with Sergeant Gabriel.
he called back with a hit on the name Almassian.
Really? From where?
from an interview card from the crime scene.
there was actually somebody there with that last name.
and we've got an address.
and they're getting a search warrant.
so -- so why don't you sit down - and just take it easy? - No, no, no.
I have to go downstairs and wait for Jake's mother.
I can do that.
I can do that.
so, sit... catch your breath.
Flynn's gonna drop by and pick you up as soon as they get the warrant.
okay.
Oh, I'm fine, really.
take it.
you never know.
gentlemen, do we know if the Almassians are home?
well, the father's due at work in about -- uh, about an hour.
best guess is the son and daughter are still inside.
here's the, uh, interview card from the crime scene.
okay. Thank you.
sergeant, let's make sure that all the exits are covered while I'm inside.
we got it, chief.
gentlemen, would you please stay out of sight for the moment?
let's see how many answers I can get before I invite y'all inside.
Mr. Almassian? - Yes?
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson of the L.A.P.D.
I need to ask you some questions, sir.
I'm on my way to work.
do you know a young man by the name of Jake Burrell?
you need to talk to my daughter.
Vanessa, this is -- I'm sorry?
deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, the L.A.P.D.
she wants to know about Jake.
so what happened? He rape another girl?
dad! - I told you we should call the cops.
now look -- he's done it again!
now, this is a serious matter, Vanessa.
I expect a serious answer.
did Jake rape you?
don't look at him! Look at me! Did he rape you?
tell her what you told me and your brother.
I see you're pregnant.
Yeah.
is Jake Burrell the father?
Yeah.
tell her what happened!
go ahead, Vanessa, tell me what happened.
no.
she would rather bring shame to her whole family.
Mr. Almassian, do you own a gun?
Yeah. What's that got to do with anything?
where is it? Where is it?
it's in the top drawer of that table by the front door.
I think you should tell me what's going on!
okay.
we have a warrant to search your house.
you have a warrant?!
here's what you do -- you cooperate.
do you understand me?! You cooperate!
you think you're ashamed now?
wait till I take you and your pregnant daughter to jail in front of the neighbors.
just give me a reason!
chief.
is there anyone else in the house besides the two of you, sir?
my son, Alex. He's sleeping.
tao: Sir, I think you and your daughter should grab a chair and stay seated.
Mr. Almassian, where were you at 9: 00 yesterday morning?
I was at work. Call my boss.
and your daughter? - She was here.
what about your son? - He was here, too.
not according to this field-interview card.
an officer stopped your son yesterday two blocks from where a young man was shot and killed and Jake Burrell was fatally wounded.
what? - What?
Jake died this morning from gunshot wounds.
chief!
look what I found in one of the bedrooms!
Mr. Almassian, where is your son?!
where is he?!
out front! He's running away!
get down!
get on the ground!
Hey, leave him alone! What's he done?!
stay back! - What's happening to Alex?!
we're arresting Alex for murder.
What?!
this is all your fault!
what -- what do you mean?
what did I do? - You're the one who got him so mad!
but Jake raped you!
no, he didn't!
he didn't.
you called me a whore. What was I supposed to say?
how about the truth?
if you told the truth from the beginning, Jake would still be alive!
it's over, chief. It's over.
no, it isn't.
I still have a notification to do.
come on. Get up.
is that her?
I think it is.
you told me you were gonna call. Why didn't you call?
uh, I'm sorry.
things got very busy, and, um... ...I ended up making an arrest.
Oh, so you found the guy who shot Jake.
I did. I did, thanks to Charlie.
I want to tell you that, because of your help and the way that you took care of Jake, we arrested the killer today.
Really? - Really.
but...
what happened to Jake?
in -- in gunshot wounds, there's always...
...There's always a serious chance of infection.
are you saying he died?
Yes, he did.
Charlie, I-I'm so sorry that I put you in such a terrible position.
I am so -- I should have been there.
there was nothing you could have done.
I could have said goodbye.
why didn't you let me say goodbye?
you kept me here when you knew he was dying.
you have every right to be angry.
you didn't even give me a chance.
I have not treated you properly. - Why didn't you give me a chance?
well -- well, let me -- let me answer you.
let -- let me answer you.
I... Look, Jake
he was in very bad shape, and he had a very limited amount of time to talk, so I had to make a decision between...
finding out who killed him and -- and -- and letting you say goodbye, and I chose to find out who killed him.
did I make the right choice?
he...
he asked about you.
Charlie, he -- he knew you were his friend.
he knew that. He did ask about you.
I...
no.
Yeah.
no, just with everything that's going on, I just think it'd be the perfect getaway.
well, I know, but it's not even that expensive.
$3, 000, and that includes everything.
Oh, and did I mention -- it's even got a theater on board where they do shows every single night.
and there's dancing.
it's like a floating city.
lieutenant.
it appears the first cut severed the carotid artery, punctured the larynx.
wounds to the shoulder and thorax on this side suggest whoever did this was...
left-handed.- Left-handed. No sexual assault.
doesn't appear so.
already tagged it, chief, and detective Sanchez confirmed the ashtray was gone when the first responders arrived.
sergeant, who called this in?
Yeah, the neighbors, after hearing the screams -- the husband's screams. Rob Price
he's out front with Flynn now.
these here...
all these, all his bloody footprints...
...from here all the way out to the street.
the folks next door said that they heard some shouting, saw him outside, behaving, as they put it,"like a madman.
did they see who he might have been chasing?
no.
okay. So, here it is.
husband, Robert Price, claims he woke suddenly from a deep sleep, came outside, and found his wife lying dead by the pool and a man dressed in black and wearing a black mask fleeing the scene.
the killer, and I quote,"looked like a ninja.
a ninja?
well, you know, husband's breath was about 40 proof.
back when I drank like that, I saw ninjas, too.
chief, apparently, the victim was talking to her cousin on the phone, talking about a cruise she was planning, and the cousin heard the victim call out her husband's name, heard sounds of a struggle, and then nothing.
we got the warrant for the house.
Oh, thank you, detective.
do you have a consent form and a pen?
chief, we already got the warrant.
Yeah, I heard him, lieutenant. Thank you.
lieutenant tao.
Mr. Price... I'm Brenda Leigh Johnson of major crimes
the guy who did this is out there.
what are you doing to find him?
all we possibly can, sir, but we need your help.
we believe that your wife's killer might have been in your house at some point this evening.
would you consent to a search?
okay. - Just sign right here.
thank you. Now, this is lieutenant Tao from crisis response.
he'll see to it that you're comfortable and well taken care of.
this way, sir, please.
detective Sanchez, please compile a list of all police reports made within a 5-mile radius over the past 6 hours.
I imagine a medieval Japanese assassin must have caught someone's attention.
chief, you don't really think
no, of course not, but I don't want to hear a defense attorney say that
I let a ninja get away because we didn't look for one. Thank you.
gentlemen, please collect all knives and remove the computers.
if the left-handed Mr. Price was having an affair, I'd really like the e-mails proving it.
did you find him yet?
Oh, the man in black?
no, but we're looking very hard.
Mr. Price, lieutenant Tao may have explained that one of the things we like to do in crisis response is encourage the families of the victims to speak freely.
you never know what tiny, little detail might unlock the whole puzzle.
so, you need me to tell you again what I saw.
Yes.
but before you do, there's a formality we need to go through, and the sooner we get through it, the faster we can focus on the manhunt.
it's all that stuff you've heard all before, you know, about the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney.
you're mirandizing me?
it's just boiler plate. It's stuff that
why the hell are you wasting your time telling me my rights?
I told you, I had nothing to do with this!
Mr. Price, our very best officers are searching the streets for your wife's killer, but they need your help.
now, I'm not allowed to take your whole statement unless we get
chief, there's something you got to hear.
one minute, detective.
if you honestly want to help us find your wife's killer
chief.
seriously.
excuse me, Mr. Price. I'll be right back.
this had better be good, detective.
it is.
911 operator: 911, what's your emergency?
you need to send somebody right away!
there's a man in our backyard trying to break in! Hurry!
please calm down, Ma'am. Can you describe the intruder to me?
I don't know! He's -- he's 6 feet tall!
he's wearing -- it's like a Halloween costume!
he's -- he's all in black!
please!
send somebody!
sanchez: That was 40 minutes before Lisa Price was stabbed, 4 miles east of the price house.
okay, and the caller later told police that she saw the guy's car, a classic red mustang with temporary dealer tags that had "Mejores Motors" on it.
now, we checked online. There's only one Mejores Motors in the U. S.It's in El Paso, Texas.
okay, sergeant, would you please get someone from El Paso PD. On the line?
maybe they can send someone over to that dealership.
thank you.
...the second the lawyer...
Tao... What do you know about ninjas?
what? I'm Asian-American. I'm supposed to be an expert on ninjas?
uh, yeah.
okay, in Japanese lore, the ninja is a warrior trained in unconventional martial arts.
weapons include the throwing star, the ninjaken -- a short sword.
chief? Chief, I got Texas on the line.
Oh, thank you, sergeant.
put them on speakerphone, please.
detective curt landry, El Paso, P.D.
to whom am I speaking?
detective Landry, this is deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, L.A. P.D. Major crimes.
sorry to bother y'all so early in the morning.
I imagine it's an earlier morning where you are, ma'am.
what can I do for you?
uh, detective, we are investigating a murder, and it seems that the car our suspect used may have been purchased in El Paso.
is that so?
what's this homicide about?
a young woman was stabbed between 25 and 30 times last evening around midnight.
we haven't ruled out the husband yet as a suspect, but
this killer -- was he left-handed?
uh, actually, sir, we believe he was.
any chance he was dressed all in black like one of them ninja fellas?
he may have been, yes.
is the sun up where you are, ma'am?
it's just rising now, sir.
well, then the good citizens of Los Angeles will be safe until nightfall.
I'll be there with you in four hours for a full briefing.
Oh, detective Landry, you don't need to come all the way out here, sir.
I'm afraid I do, ma'am. I'll see you in a bit.
uh, detective Landry, wait.
Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I stood 40 minutes on the curb at the airport waiting for you.
well, daddy!
I called you half a dozen times on your cellphone. Why didn't you pick up?
well, how was I to know you were gonna call me?
they make you turn off your cellphone when you get on the airplane.
you know what? It's okay.
we both know I'm not gonna be around too much longer, so you might as well get a jump on it by starting to forget me now.
grandpa, you have no idea what aunt Brenda does or how hard she works or how serious it all is.
well, thank you, Charlie, but people don't need to know that.
first, I do know!
second, her name is not Charlie.
it's Charlene, after my mother, not charlie!
what is it about L. A.That when somebody comes here, they're encouraged to be somebody else?
Oh, thank you, honey, but I-I'm not staying.
I-I'm just taking a quick shower and heading back to work.
