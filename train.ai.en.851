look how good you are.
pout, pout, pout. - What are you doing?
Oh, shoot. I gotta go meet Dan.
no, you're staying here. I need you.
I can't let my mother down.
Hey, you almost here?
Hey, I'm really, really, sorry, but I'm kind of stuck at this photo shoot with Blair.
it's a long story, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
Oh, a photo shoot, huh?
it sounds really superficial, I know.
but it's important to her and, you know, she's important to me.
but I'll make it up to you, though, I promise.
no, it's no big deal, really. Don't worry about it.
you're the best.
I knew you'd understand.
I'll call you later.
Yeah, yeah.
how many?
none.
you're still here.
Yeah, I told you I'd wait.
mm, a man who keeps his word.
I like it.
you get a chance to talk to your client?
I'm back, aren't I?
write me up an invoice. - Really?
that's great.
well, you're awfully excited.
this isn't your first time, is it?
selling a painting.
few firsts are left for me.
but the artist will be very pleased.
She's...been doing other things for a while.
it's kind of a big deal for her.
well, for my client, too.
this is a very special piece.
you wouldn't want to...
I don't know -- celebrate with a drink?
actually, the previously mentioned excited artist is my wife.
I thought you said the artist lived in Hudson.
long commute.
she lives there.
I don't.
if the trains ever stop running...
phase three--pub crawl.
five boroughs.
50 pubs...
500 chances to get laid.
and remember, don't dip your shillelagh...in the wrong pot of gold.
let's go. You can think about your boyfriend inside.
I'm not coming.
seriously, Carter Baizen sucks.
all right, I don't know what spell he's put you under, but he's not your friend.
he can't be trusted.
and why is that?
cause he doesn't believe what you believe in?
it's exactly what he said-- the money, the drugs, the privileges.
they're just keeping us numb so we don't know it's -- it's better out there in the real world.
the real world? Everyone out there wants to be us.
we are what you aspire to, not run away from.
you really don't get me, do you?
that dream of yours, you know, what is it, really?
cause I hear you talk about how you don't want to go to Dartmouth and how you don't want to follow in your father's footsteps, but what exactly do you want?
all I know is it's not this.
well, you better discover what "it" is before you throw everything away trying to find it.
and where are you going?
how was the movie?
uh, missable...
literally.
I-I don't know about Serena, dad.
I-I can't tell if she's worth it.
what do you mean?
well, uh, she's best friends with this girl - -Blair Waldorf who is basically everything I hate about the upper east side distilled into one 95-pound, doe-eyed, bon mot tossing, label-whoring package of girlie evil.
no one's that bad. - She is.
I would barely be exaggerating if I told you Medusa wants her withering glare back.
well, if there's anything I've learned it's that usually there's something beneath the surface with people like that to make them act the way they do.
like what-- the O. J.In her mimosa was from concentrate, not fresh-squeezed?
and -- and what does this say about Serena, that this is her best friend?
I dated a girl like Serena once-- actually, a lot like Serena.
and girls like that are challenging. It's true.
they're complicated and...enigmatic...
and usually worth it.
and the only way you'll know for sure is to jump in with both feet.
what happened with you?
I swam for a while...till I drowned.
well, that--thanks. That's a great story, dad.
now get some sleep, and I will see you in the morning.
we'll go to the photo shoot together.
you haven't done this since I was little.
you haven't been in bed by 10: 00 since you were little.
you looked beautiful tonight, you know?
Really?
Hello?
how was the movie?
did I miss something amazing?
well...
well, uh, even without the movie.
don't be cocky.
I'm calling you with a make up plan.
Oh, are you now? - I am.
how would you like to see what really happens at a fashion shoot?
I'm sorry. This is--this is Dan Humphrey.
are you sure you're not trying to reach my sister?
look, I know it's a girlieoffer, but chew on this-- I'll be there.
can I bet on that?
because law of average essays I lose my shirt.
Oh, come on. It's Blair's shoot, so I have to be there for moral support.
Blair? Well, I'm definitely not going now.
look, she's really not as bad as you think.
besides, she's gonna be so busy with the shoot that you won't even have to see her, and since it's so boring on the sidelines, you'll have my full attention.
okay, what if I buy you anything you want from craft service?
I thought craft service was free.
I'll see you in the morning at 8: 00. I'm texting you the address.
I'm hanging up before thou dost protest again.
both feet, Humphrey.
what's the emergency apart from my not getting my sleep before the big day, Laurel, and why couldn't we simply have discussed it over the phone?
because if we didn't meet in person, I couldn't show you these.
I don't think this girl is what you're trying to say unapproachable, controlled, perfect.
she is not unapproachable. She is poised.
she's regal.
look, I know she's your daughter, and I don't want to make problems...
but your girl is rigid like a twig.
you know, she's afraid to let you in, so your works of art and she fail to achieve
what's the word?
symbiosis.
what can be done at this stage?
your daughter is beautiful, yes, but this girl --
this girl has it.
she is warm like sunshine. She has fun.
she will make the clients think if they buy these clothes, then they will have fun, too.
but this is your line, Eleanor.
it's completely your choice.
the rules for a model the day of a photo shoot are similar to those of a patient presurgery, wear comfortable clothing and make sure your affairs are in order.
you never know what could go wrong in a flash.
Hey, B. You must either be sleeping or already on your way.
but I can't wait to see you at the shoot.
we're gonna have so much fun!
Oh, thank god you're awake.
am I late?
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Did I oversleep?
darling, I have some bad news.
Terry, that fool of a photographer, thinks we need to go in a different direction.
with the theme?
with the model.
darling, I hired these people for their expertise, and ultimately, they feel that...
we would be doing the Branda disservice.
I-I cannot apologize enough.
I know that you were really looking forward to this.
no, I wasn't.
I'm -- I'm glad I don't have to go.
I hate shoots.
they're so boring.
you should have a Lessandra Ambrosio, not an amateur.
we'll have dinner after, yes?
steak frites and crepe sat cafe des artistes, just like old times.
I will see you later.
Hey, S.
all right, I hope you're not already there, because as it turns out, my modeling career's over faster than Jessica Simpson's acting one.
now that I think about it, maybe we should crash the shoot anyway and see who they replace me with, make fun of the skinny bitch?
how could you?
actually, I like this here.
this is no joke, Humphrey.
what are you doing with that?
the question is, what are you doing selling it to me?
you...
you're Bex's client.
Oh, and you didn't know.
I'm just surprised you hired someone with taste.
Oh, well, I am equally as shocked, because when she said she found something amazing in Brooklyn, your gallery never entered my mind.
what I recognize is the fact that your wife would not want this hanging in my house.
Alison's a professional artist.
she doesn't do background checks on prospective buyers, and neither do I.
besides, it's been almost 20 years.
and you still don't know women.
and you still know it all.
your wife despises me.
I wouldn't say that.
well, she did.
I mean, she may have been wearing a slip dress and Doc Martens at the time, but she definitely meant it.
she's not like you.
she doesn't hold on to that stuff.
why don't you call and ask her?
or are you still giving her space?
because trust me, putting this up in my house, even having this conversation with you, will only drive he further away.
well, what do you want me to do then?
take it back.
you can call Bex and set up a refund.
so what'd you think of it?
I thought...
it was extraordinary.
we got talk. Where r u call you later hey, no phones.
Oh, right. Sorry, man.
how much you up?
that's insane, amigo.
I should probably quit while I'm ahead, huh?
what? We just started.
well, I've had a good run.
Plus, it's better to leave while you're up.
I'm not -- I'm not gonna let you do that, bro.
the table's about to get smaller.
people are gonna start showing their real stuff.
up until now it's been cards, but...
from now on, it's an adventure.
just a couple more hands.
all right, gents, ante up.
okay.
let's hit it.
you've got to be kidding me.
fantastic. One, two, three, come on--oh!
there she is. Blair! Come on, quick.
what took you so long?
Hey.
Blair, Blair, wait, where are you going?
Blair, wait. Why are you so mad?
why am I mad?
you mean why aren't i furious?
I can't believe for one second I thought that it'd be different this time!
you though what would be different?
you couldn't deal with the spotlight shining on me for once, could you?
what are you talking about?
I was told we were doing this together.
what, did you not get my message?
what about this morning then?
when you glanced at the call sheet, did you see my name on it?
when I wasn'tin hair and makeup, didn't that seem strange?
when the dressing room only had your name on the door, what, did you think they just forgot?
I was told you were running late, and they asked me to do some test shots first.
Blair, they told me you wanted me here.
and you believed them?
look, Blair, I encouraged you to do this.
why would I try to steal something from you that I pushed you to do?
because you take everything from me!
Nate, my mom! - Blair!
you can't even help it.
it's who you are.
I just thought maybe this time it would be different.
I should have known I'd be wrong.
great.
spotted-- lonely boy's rude awakening.
upper east side queens aren't born at the top.
they climb their way up in heels, no matter who they have to tread on to do it.
Terry, I think it's very good.
I like the bridge in the background, but we need her back.
I know. What-- here you are Terry wanted me to tell you how perfect you looked...
Eleanor, I quit. - With these now.
wait a minute. Why?
I think you know why.
because of Blair?
I know that she will support my decision...
once I explain it to her.
you know you love the spotlight. You always have.
it's part of your charm.
there is nothing wrong with that.
who are you?
what are you doing here?
I have no idea, actually. I...
Hey, I -- I kind a over heard you guys in the stair well there.
Dan, look, I really can't go now.
O-okay, well, forget I said anything then.
in fact, you know what? I'm mute. I'll just stand here and blink real quiet.
unless you want me to -- hand me my jeans?
Yes, please.
it's just, uh, I thought you wanted to be on the side lines here.
I thought you wanted to be here for your friend Blair.
you know, we were gonna get craft service, and I'd have your "full attention"?
say it.
I-I don't think I have to.
so my best friend doesn't believe me, and neither does the guy I like.
look, Dan, Blair's mom basically tricked me into coming here because she didn't want Blair.
how do you tell your best friend something like that?
I - I didn't -- I guess I didn't...
look, you know what, Dan?
just go, okay?
I - I need to clean up, and I just need to get out of here.
Serena send you here to talk to me?
no, believe it or not, I actually came here myself.
normally, wouldn't be this close to you without a tetanus shot.
my, uh, my mom kind a left us a couple months ago...
only my...
my dad and my sister don't really see that...
cause she told us she had to go away for the summer to, um, to follow her dream of being an artist.
but it's -- it's not summer anymore, and she's still up there, and that's all she seems to care about right now.
every time I go to see her, I tell myself, this time,
I'm gonna tell her what I think.
this time, I'm gonna look her in the eye and say, "either come home or leave for good."
and so there I was, just the other day.
I was sitting across the table from her, looking her straight in the eye, and I didn't say anything.
why not?
I don't know, but I wish I had, 'cause even if it didn't change anything, she'd know how I felt.
bullet, gentlemen.
first bet.
5 to call.
Hey, I don't have the money. Call his bet.
it's all luck.
Hey, you guys okay with a marker?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
if you're ever gonna take a risk, start now.
what's the point of anything less?
it's fine.
you sure he's good for it?
of course he is.
he's an Archibald.
make it $10, 000.
five to call.
call.
show your cards.
trip bullets. The trip aces take it.
that's rough. - You told me to.
it's the luck of the draw, my friend.
he -- he had three aces.
look, I don't, um, it might take me a little while to get the money.
wait, wait, wait. Wait.
a little while?
come on, man.
snap your fingers.
wait a minute.
are you in with these guys?
did you play me, man? Are you playing me, huh?
Hey, hey, hold on.
I guess that's a yes.
just give him the money, man. Money means nothing to you.
this guys aren't playing, but no one has to get hurt.
I'm trying to help you out.
Yeah, you're a real friend.
who let you in here, Bass?
he set me up.
no one forced his hand.
your boy lost fair and square. - Did you?
look, man, if you don't get 'em the money right away,
I'm gonna tell everyone where you live, and they can come get it from your d...
what do you think about that?
look.
look, you got my watch and my ball.
you keep them.
take care of these guys.
I don't call the cops, and we walk out of here.
it's cool. I-I-I got it. I got it.
I'm gonna have to transfer some money and pray the captain doesn't notice before I find a way to put it back.
you don't have to pay me back, you know.
I mean, it was worth every cent to see the last of that guy.
no, I want to.
I mean it.
Thanks.
that can't be right. - What's up?
it says I'm zeroed out.
maybe you have the wrong account.
no, no, no, no. There must be something wrong.
I accessed this account last month, and it said there was almost $200, 000.
Hey, tom, thanks for getting back to me so quickly.
your message said it was important.
um, yeah, I was -- I was checking my accounts, and I came across what I assume to be an error, in that my trust seems to have a zero balance.
Oh, uh, I thought you knew.
that account was drained weeks ago.
Drained?
but by who?
your father.
he said he discussed it with you.
we -- we have to solve this. I mean, what are we gonna do?
I'm not into getting a lingerie model.
uh, Blair, honey, there's been a terrible mistake.
how would you like your job back?
did you choose Serena over me?
you could've picked a stranger.
you didn't have to choose my best friend.
what, did you think that I wouldn't find out?
I was going to tell you tonight...at dinner.
it--there was no right decision. There...
there -- there wasn't any time.
I know you can understand all this.
it was mishandled -- the whole thing -- from top to bottom.
you actually want me to agree with you.
Bendel's will legitimize this company.
it will take everything to the next level.
you know how hard I have worked for that.
you've always been my biggest supporter, my biggest fan.
I'm your daughter.
and as my daughter, I knew that you would forgive me, in time, but if my company had lost this deal because of you?
I'd never forgive myself.
I hope you never do.
you didn't hear it from us, but in every girl's life, there comes a moment when she realizes that her mother just might be more messed up than she is.
you're still here?
Yeah, well, I thought I couldn't leave without bringing you something from craft service.
um, and, uh, and telling you that I'm sorry I judged you.
well, I'm sorry I gave you reason to.
Hey, how about you ask me out again?
how about you actually show up?
okay.
no drama, no disruptions. I promise.
you promise? Oh, no! That means it's never gonna happen now.
okay, quick. I take it back. I unpromise.
Friday. 8:00.
I think we can agree to those terms, but you can't wear those shoes.
or that hair.
okay, see you then.
all right.
so you were right. - I know.
when I got that call, I should've known you had nothing to do with it.
and I should never have pushed you to do this whole thing in the first place.
actually, I'm glad you pushed me it ended up being a very important day for me.
I just thought it was gonna be more fun.
I know. Me, too.
Hey, you know what?
who says it still can't be?
come on. Come on.
this just in-- S. And B. committing a crime of fashion.
who doesn't love a 5-finger discount?
especially if one of those fingers is the middle one.
where are my clothes?
everyone knows you can't choose your family, but you can choose your friends, and in a world ruled by bloodlines and bank accounts, it pays to have a pal.
do it again. One, two--one, two, three.
as a B. F.F can make you go W. T.F, there's no denying we'd all be a little less rich without them.
and Serena and Blair -- they do besties better than anyone.
no, that's not a tear in my eye.
it's just allergies.
without you, I'm nothing.
gossip girl.
gossip GIRL HERE--YOUR ONE AND ONLY SOURCE INTO THE SCANDALOUS LIVES OF MANHATTAN'S ELITE. YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE WHAT'S ON "GOSSIP GIRL.
long AGO, WHEN EUROPEAN ROYALS GREW BORED WITH PALACE BALLS,
they TOOK A PAGE FROM THE PEONS AND ADDED SOME PAGEANTRY.
until YOU ADD A MASK,
but PREPARING FOR A BALL IS AN EVENT IN ITSELF,
which IS WHY QUEENS INVENTED HANDMAIDENS.
so THE DRESSES SHOULD BE DELIVERED,
and I'LL TAKE THE SMALL STUFF WITH ME. WHICH ONE'S YOURS?
Oh, NO. I'M JUST HELPING BLAIR,
but I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE'LL SEE.
well, HERE'S HOPING.
we'll PUT IT ON BLAIR'S TAB. OH, NO, NO, NO.
the GIRLS AT THAT PARTY ARE MY BEST CUSTOMERS.
why NOT SHOW OFF MY LATEST WARES?
just RETURN IT AFTER THE BALL.
so KATI MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT A CUSTOM-MADE CORSET,
and I HEAR THERE ARE WIGS INVOLVED?
it's A MASQUERADE. YOU HAVE TO CONCEAL YOUR IDENTITY,
but I DO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL PLANNED FOR NATE TONIGHT.
it's A GAME. IT'S A SCAVENGER HUNT.
Nate STARTS THE NIGHT WITH A CLUE, WHICH LEADS HIM TO A LADY-IN-WAITING, WHO GIVES HIM A CLUE TO THE NEXT LADY-- WAIT. HOLD ON. YOU HAVE LADIES NOW?
if HE FINDS ME BEFORE MIDNIGHT WHEN THE MASKS COME OFF,
he CAN CLAIM HIS PRIZE. AND WHAT'S THAT?
Oh. YEAH, RIGHT. SORRY.
I JUST FIGURED THAT AFTER EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED,
or HASN'T HAPPENED,
I SHOULD FIND SOME WAY TO MAKE IT SPECIAL.
well, THAT'S REALLY ROMANTIC, BLAIR.
really.
look, UM, IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO COME TONIGHT,
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. I COULD JUST
what? NO, I WANT YOU TO COME.
in FACT, I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD BE ONE OF MY LADIES.
would YOU GIVE NATE THE LAST CLUE?
are YOU SURE YOU WANT ME TO?
tonight IS ALL ABOUT STARTING OVER.
I TRUST YOU... AND HIM.
well, THEN I WILL BE HONORED TO SERVE YOU, MY QUEEN.
well, BESIDES, YOU'RE BRINGING DAN, RIGHT?
a BALL? HAVEN'T YOU HEARD? YOUR SISTER'S CINDERELLA.
and LET ME GUESS. YOUR WICKED STEPSISTER IS BLAIR WALDORF.
Blair MAY HAVE ASKED ME TO DO A FEW THINGS,
but I'M HAPPY TO HELP. AND IF SHE HAPPENS TO HELP YOU OUT WITH AN INVITE AND OUTFIT?
it'll ALL BE WORTH IT. EVERYONE IN DISGUISE IN THIS OLD BALLROOM-- IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING. YOU KNOW,
I'm ACTUALLY SURPRISED SERENA DIDN'T MENTION IT. WHY? WE'VE ONLY BEEN OUT TWICE.
it's NOT LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN,
we HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT, WELL I GOTTA GO DELIVER THIS STUFF.
let ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ME TO PICK YOU UP A TUX.
what? IT'S A MASKED BALL.
I'm SURE SHE THINKS I'D NEVER GO TO SOMETHING THAT PRETENTIOUS,
which SHOWS SHE KNOWS ME WELL. I KNOW HIM. A MASKED BALL?
Dan WOULD NEVER WANT TO GO TO SOMETHING THAT PRETENTIOUS,
where HE HAS TO WEAR A MASK AND A TUX?
he LIKES YOU. HE WOULD WEAR A TUX AND A MASK AND ONE OF MY MOTHER'S DRESSES
if IT MEANT THAT HE COULD GO OUT WITH YOU. COME ON.
what, ARE YOU WORRIED THAT HE ALREADY HAS A DATE?
I MEAN, HE IS DAN HUMPHREY. SHUT UP. I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS A MASKED BALL IS BETTER THAN A REGULAR PARTY
because THEN ALL THOSE KIDS FROM SCHOOL THAT HE HATES
he WON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THEM. ALL RIGHT. INVITE HIM. I INSIST.
I'm NOT SAYING I WOULDN'T GO.
if SERENA ASKED ME, I WOULDN'T DEPRIVE HER OF MY COMPANY.
no, THAT WOULD BE TOO CRUEL.
but SHE HASN'T ASKED ME, SO...
if YOU WANT TO GO WITH HER, JUST MAKE IT HAPPEN.
put YOURSELF OUT THERE. THIS THING HAPPENS IN A MATTER OF HOURS.
is THAT HER?
uh, NO, IT'S VANESSA.
that's BEEN A WHILE.
you GONNA ANSWER THAT? OF COURSE. WHY WOULDN'T I?
Hello? VANESSA.
Hi. YEAH, IT'S ME.
so WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UP? HOW'S VERMONT?
do YOU STILL HAVE MY COPY OF "THE CRYING OF LOT 49"?
um, I DON'T KNOW.
well, COULD YOU CHECK?
okay. I HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOU IN OVER A YEAR,
and YOU CALLED TO ASK ME ABOUT AN OLD BOOK?
you KNOW, IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.
try OVER BY THE WINDOW.
Vanessa. SURPRISE!
what? OH, MY GOD.
how ARE YOU? SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE.
What--what ARE YOU DOING HERE? MY PARENTS SAID I COULD LIVE WITH MY SISTER AND FINISH HIGH SCHOOL IN THE CITY. SO--SO THAT MEANS YOU'RE
I'm BACK FOR GOOD.
that IS...
awesome, I HOPE?
Yeah, T-TOTALLY. YES, OF COURSE.
it's JUST... UNEXPECTED.
unexpectedly AWESOME.
go AHEAD. ANSWER THAT. I'M STARVING, AND I SMELL WAFFLES.
Hi. SERENA, HEY.
Hey. HI.
go AHEAD. DO IT.
uh, HEY, I WAS JUST WONDERING,
are YOU, UH, ARE YOU, UH, DOING ANYTHING TONIGHT?
tonight? NO. NO, NOTHING. WHY?
good, BECAUSE THERE'S THIS THING,
and YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA THINK IT'S STUPID, BUT... TELL ME.
even COLD, THESE ARE SO GOOD.
I-I've MISSED RUFUS' COOKING. I HAVE.
Rufus, DO YOU HAVE WHIPPED CREAM? WHO'S THAT?
uh, IT'S... IT'S MY SISTER,
but YOU--YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING.
Hi, BLAIR. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO WITH THIS STUFF? OH, JUST LEAVE THEM OVER THERE.
that's FINE. I LEFT YOU ANOTHER LIST.
is ANYONE THERE? HELLO?
I'm SORRY. UH... WHAT?
uh, YOU--YOU WERE ASKING ME SOMETHING.
no, UH...
no, NEVER MIND.
thank YOU. HAVE A GOOD DAY. OKAY.
Bye.
so WHAT ARE WE DOING TONIGHT?
I THINK I NEED A DATE.
damn IT, ANNE, I TOLD YOU NO STARCH.
Howard, WE'VE BEEN GOING TO THE SAME CLEANERS FOR 19 YEARS.
your SHIRTS ARE EXACTLY HOW THEY ALWAYS ARE.
we BOTH KNOW THIS ISN'T ABOUT LAUNDRY. I'M SORRY, BUT I NEED EVERYTHING TO BE PERFECT AT ELEANOR'S PARTY TONIGHT.
I CAN'T SCREW UP. ELEANOR KNOWS YOU'RE THE BEST PERSON TO TAKE HER COMPANY PUBLIC. SHE'S GOING TO PICK YOU.
just SHOW UP AND BE YOURSELF.
look, I'M GONNA CALL YOU FROM THE OFFICE.
I GOTTA LOOK OVER THE PROPOSAL AGAIN.
Hey, MOM.
Oh, NATE.
is EVERYTHING OKAY WITH DAD?
just WORK STUFF. NOTHING FOR YOU TO WORRY ABOUT.
sure.
God! I LOVE NEW YORK.
there WAS ONLY ONE THEATER IN WOODBURY,
and ALL IT EVER PLAYED WERE FAMILY MOVIES.
"the PACIFIER" PLAYED FOR, LIKE, A YEAR.
and THEY SAID VIN DIESEL COULDN'T DO COMEDY.
I CAN'T PICK. OVERWHELMED BY CHOICE.
whatever YOU WANT.
Yeah, SURE, WHATEVER. YOU DO WANNA DO SOMETHING, RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU DON'T HAVE PLANS.
big NIGHT OUT WITH OVERPRIVILEGED, UNDER-PARENTED TRUST FUND BRATS FROM YOUR FANCY SCHOOL?
Yeah, THE LIMO'S ACTUALLY WAITING BACK AT THE LOFT.
good. WE CAN EGG IT. MAYBE SLASH THE TIRES?
so IS IT WEIRD, HAVING ME BACK?
no. WHY, UH, WHY-- WHY WOULD IT BE WEIRD?
because WE SAID SOME THINGS THE NIGHT THAT I LEFT
things THAT YOU IMMEDIATELY ASKED ME TO TAKE BACK.
because I WAS LEAVING, BUT... NOW I'M HERE.
Yeah, AND IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR, YOU KNOW?
a LOT HAS HAPPENED, ACTUALLY.
and I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT IT TONIGHT.
late SHOW. ANGELIKA? WHATEVER'S PLAYING?
unless IT'S "THE PACIFIER." UNLESS IT'S "THE PACIFIER."
all RIGHT. I'LL GET TICKETS.
glad TO BE HOME, HUMPHREY.
glad TO HAVE YOU, ABRAMS.
so WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
evidence.
of WHAT?
the CAPTAIN'S DISLIKE OF STARCHY SHIRTS?
I TOTALLY SYMPATHIZE. THE COLLARS CHAFE.
did YOU, UH, ASK HIM ABOUT YOUR MISSING COLLEGE MONEY?
Yeah, HE SAID HE WAS MOVING ACCOUNTS AROUND.
it WAS ALL BACK THE NEXT DAY. SO WHY WORRY? MYSTERIOUS FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS,
warring PARENTS. WELCOME TO THE UPPER EAST SIDE.
chi CHI, GET THE LLELLO. NATHANIEL, I'M SHOCKED.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE STRICTLY AN HERBAL MAN.
this ISN'T MINE.
who DOES THIS DAN HUMPHREY THINK HE IS?
Serena IS PUTTING UP ATRONG FRONT,
but I CAN SEE HOW HURT SHE IS.
we HAVE TO HELP HER HEAL HER HEART. BUT IT'S PRETTY LATE NOTICE.
most OF THE GOOD ONES ARE ALREADY TAKEN. NO MORE EXCUSES. SERENA MUST HAVE THE HOTTEST DATE EVER.
if HE'S GOT PLANS, HE'LL CHANGE THEM.
if HE'S GOT A GIRLFRIEND, HE'LL DUMP HER,
and IF HE'S OUT OF TOWN, HE'LL CHARTER A G5 AND FLY HOME.
make IT HAPPEN.
do YOU LIKE IT? THAT'S OUTSTANDING.
is IT A BONG, MOTHER?
please. I DIDN'T TAKE YOU FOR A STONER.
it's A... A HOOKAH... MM-HMM.
and IT IS ADORABLE. IT'S PERFECT FOR MY MOROCCAN-THEMED PARTY.
why DO YOU HAVE TO CELEBRATE YOUR BENDEL'S DEAL BY TURNING OUR PENTHOUSE INTO AN OPIUM DEN?
why NOT?
Hey, IT'S BLAIR.
I'm sorry I can't come to the phone right now, but I'm getting ready for the masked ball.
see you tonight,if you recognize me,which you won't.
Hey, BLAIR. IT'S ME. I, UM...
I JUST-- I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
it's, UH, THERE'S THIS THING WITH MY DAD,
and, UM...
you KNOW, I JUST-- I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
so CAN YOU CALL ME BACK WHEN YOU CAN? THANKS.
well, THAT'S ALL OF IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE WITHOUT YOU. THANK YOU.
that's OKAY. YEAH, IT WAS FUN.
I'm GLAD. IT'S ALL PART OF YOUR EDUCATION.
and IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE LEARNING. IT'S A NICE BRACELET.
vintage, RIGHT? THE DIAMONDS LOOK REAL.
cause THEY SORT OF ARE.
uh, THE MAN AT THE STORE LENT IT TO ME.
why WOULD HE DO THAT?
Oh! OH, SWEETIE, YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GONNA BE ABLE TO COME TONIGHT, RIGHT?
I THOUGHT MAYBE, YEAH.
Jenny, FRESHMEN DON'T GET TO GO TO THE MASKED BALL.
it's JUST TRADITION. NO, I KNOW. IT'S JUST THAT THERE WERE FIVE DRESSES.
Oh, IT-- YOU ALWAYS NEED BACKUP.
I MEAN, WHAT--WHAT IF I SPILLED SOMETHING OR A ZIPPER BROKE?
Yeah, OF COURSE. I'LL--I'LL REMEMBER THAT.
have FUN TONIGHT.
I WILL, AND DON'T WORRY,
your TIME WILL COME. I PROMISE.
now IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GET READY.
do YOU THINK THAT ELEANOR WALDORF WILL FIND THIS... NIGHT IN TANGIERS ENOUGH?
maybe IF YOU BROUGHT A GOAT.
you KNOW, ELEANOR ALWAYS GOES ALL-OUT. SPEAKING OF GOING ALL-OUT...
Yeah, I KNOW. TELL ME ABOUT IT. I DON'T THINK THE WALDORF WOMEN EVER MET A THEME THEY DIDN'T JUST LOVE.
you GOING WITH DAN?
um, NO, DAN HAS PLANS, ACTUALLY. DOING WHAT?
the QUESTION IS "WITH WHOM"?
Oh, I DIDN'T REALIZE.
well, FRANKLY, I AM RELIEVED.
you KNOW, AT YOUR AGE, YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING THE FIELD.
what ABOUT AT YOUR AGE? YOU GOT A HOT DATE TONIGHT?
what? NO, PLEASE. WHO WOULD I BE DATING?
you KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA GO TRY THIS ON
and SEE IF I CAN FIND A GOAT.
Hi. Serena?
kati Farkas gave me your address.
Yeah. Hi. Who's this?
well, HE'S NO DAN, BUT I GUESS HE'LL DO.
Hey, JEN, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS,
but, UH, VANESSA IS BACK IN TOWN.
so WE'RE GOING TO A MOVIE TONIGHT, AND I DON'T KNOW
if YOU'RE GOING TO THAT BALL OR NOT,
but I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WANTED TO COME WITH.
so, UH, WE'RE GETTING TICKETS ONLINE. CALL ME BACK.
why IS IT THAT FRIENDS OF SERENA VAN DER WOODSEN HELP HER SEARCH FOR HER SUITOR?
have FABLES FALLEN SO OUT OF FASHION THAT THE PRINCESSES HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING THEMSELVES?
call US OLD-SCHOOL,
but SOMETIMES THE FAIRY-TALE ENDING
requires THE KNIGHT TO GET OFF HIS ASS
and SADDLE UP HIS STEED.
So...What are we doing tonight?
maybe IT'S NEVER TOO LATE FOR A BOLD GESTURE.
got a mask?
Nate, HEY.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE? I THOUGHT YOU WERE, UM,
shouldn't YOU BE GETTING READY?
I'm SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. IT'S, UM, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
Yeah, OF COURSE.
come IN.
Thanks.
maybe IT'S OLD. YOU KNOW, LEFT OVER FROM THE '90s OR SOMETHING,
from SOME NIGHT AT LIMELIGHT OR THE TUNNEL?
our PARENTS DID WAY WORSE STUFF THAN WE DO.
it's NOT OLD, AND IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE.
I THINK HE'S HAVING SOME MONEY PROBLEMS.
well, HAVE YOU ASKED HIM ABOUT IT?
Yeah.
I JUST WISH, YOU KNOW, I WISH HE'D BE HONEST WITH ME.
it's LIKE HE AND MY MOM
they MADE SOME SECRET PACT TO ACT LIKE ROBOTS.
Yeah, WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT PACT IS SO SECRET.
I THINK ALL OF OUR PARENTS SIGNED IT. BUT I'M NOT A LITTLE KID ANYMORE.
he DOESN'T HAVE TO SHUT ME OUT.
look, IF WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT,
he's PROBABLY REALLY SCARED.
maybe YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL MORE THAN ONCE
for HIM TO REALLY HEAR YOU, YOU KNOW?
Hey, DON'T GIVE UP, OKAY?
you SHOULD PROBABLY GO.
you KNOW, I'VE GOTTA GET READY AND STUFF.
Yeah, ME, TOO. UM...
look, THANKS FOR JUST LISTENING.
that's FINE. YEAH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
Chuck JUST WANTED A BUMP, AND BLAIR'S PHONE WAS TURNED OFF, SO IT, UM, REALLY MEANS A LOT.
Yeah, ANYTIME, NATE. I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT, OKAY?
all RIGHT. I'LL SEE YA. BYE.
Hey, ANYBODY HOME?
Hey, YOU AND DAN GOING OUT?
just TO THE MOVIES. WHAT ABOUT YOU?
a HUMPHREY MAN IN A SPORTS COAT?
I'd NORMALLY ASK IF YOU HAD A DATE, BUT-- BUT MY WIFE LEFT ME, HMM?
Yeah. WHAT'S UP WITH ALISON? DAN SAYS SHE'S STILL UPSTATE.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST FOR THE SUMMER. SO DID HER HUSBAND.
okay, WE'LL CIRCLE BACK TO THAT.
one ISSUE AT A TIME. LIKE WHERE ARE MY KEYS?
what DO YOU NEED KEYS FOR? JUST USE DAN'S WINDOW.
where IS DAN, BY THE WAY?
uh, HE SHOULD BE BACK IN A MINUTE. HMM.
so, UH, DAN SEEMS HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
why WOULDN'T HE BE?
well, UM, IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING SO,
when YOU LEFT HERE, YOU KIND OF BROKE HIS HEART.
I'm BACK, AREN'T I?
I HATED BEING AWAY FROM THE CITY.
away FROM DAN.
did YOU TELL DAN THIS?
no, NOT YET, BUT I'M PLANNING ON IT TONIGHT
before OR AFTER THE MOVIE. I'M NOT SURE YET.
you KNOW, I GOTTA PICK MY MOMENT.
it's KIND OF A BIG DEAL.
Oh, THANKS.
you KNOW, THERE'S, UH,
a LOT THAT'S CHANGED SINCE YOU WERE HERE.
so DAN SAYS.
but YOU GUYS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CLOSE.
you'll FIGURE IT OUT.
wish ME LUCK?
me, TOO.
where ARE YOU GOING ANYWAY? UH, JUST SOME PARTY.
with A FRIEND?
I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL HER THAT.
see YA.
Hello?
Hey. WHERE ARE YOU? AT YOUR HOUSE.
Oh. OH, YOU'RE EARLY.
Yeah, I JUST COULDN'T WAIT.
Oh, UM, I TRIED TO GET YOU BEFORE YOU LEFT.
I-I FEEL TERRIBLE.
cause I'M EARLY?
no, BECAUSE, UM, I... I TOTALLY SPACED.
I HAVE THIS, UH,
american HISTORY PAPER DUE MONDAY.
so YOU KNOW, I'LL BE WRITING ALL NIGHT.
I'll make it up to you, though. I promise.
PIEROGIS AT VESELKA?
I'll CALL YOU TOMORROW.
Jenny, HEY.
Hey.
W
Jenny, WHAT'S WRONG?
and HOW IS THIS A FAVOR TO ME AGAIN?
Rufus, LOOK AROUND. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD ACCESS TO THE TOP PEOPLE IN MUSIC AND ART?
introduce YOURSELF. REVITALIZE YOUR FLAGGING CAREER.
put THAT SAD LITTLE GALLERY ON THE CULTURAL RADAR.
since WHEN WERE YOU THE PATRON SAINT OF FORMER ROCK STARS?
since WHEN WERE YOU A STAR? NO, LOOK, LEAVE IF YOU WANT TO.
really. ALISON WOULD HAVE A FIT IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE ACCOMPANYING ME TO THIS PARTY,
even IF IT WAS FOR YOUR BENEFIT. ACTUALLY, I DON'T CARE WHAT ALISON THINKS RIGHT NOW.
good. THEN LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR HOSTESS.
it IS DIVINE. SQUINT, AND IT'S MARRAKECH.
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE BRINGING A DATE.
how DELIGHTFUL. OH, THIS IS RUFUS HUMPHREY.
Oh, IT'S NOT A DATE. OH, PLEASURE.
it's NOT A DATE. MM-HMM.
look. APPETIZERS. IS THAT COUSCOUS?
Yes, PLEASE.
Hey. BART!
Hi.
and FRIEND.
Oh. MM. SOMETHING CATCH YOUR EYE?
Oh, I LIKE HER OUTFIT. LILY.
hello.
Hi.
I'd LIKE YOU TO MEET CARISSA. YEAH, HI. CARISSA.
Hi.
Hi. RUFUS. HI, RUFUS.
Yeah, HI. WELL, IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
great TO SEE YOU. ENJOY.
you AND BART BASS? SUDDENLY IT ALL MAKES SENSE.
you BROUGHT ME HERE TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS. OH, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
I MEAN, IT'S FLATTERING, I GUESS,
but COULDN'T YOU HAVE DONE A LITTLE BETTER? OH, NOT ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.
Oh! HOW ARE YOU? THIS IS FANTASTIC.
this IS BEAUTIFUL. GOD BLESS YOU.
so THIS BLAIR GIRL USED YOU AS HER SLAVE?
no, I WAS HER HANDMAIDEN. "HANDMAIDEN" IS JANE AUSTEN FOR "SLAVE."
she NEVER ACTUALLY SAID I WOULD GET TO GO TO THE BALL,
even IF I DID ALL THOSE ERRANDS. UNH-UNH. DON'T MAKE EXCUSES FOR HER.
you DID ALL THAT STUFF. YOU DESERVE TO GO. I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT MASKED BALLS ARE "TOTALLY PRETENTIOUS." ONE WOMAN'S OPINION.
but IF YOU WANNA GO, NO BLAIR SHOULD KEEP YOU AWAY.
it's NOT JUST BLAIR. I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE A GOWN. MY FRIEND WORKS IN THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT AT B. A.M.
we CAN BORROW ONE. NEXT? I DON'T HAVE AN INVITATION.
every BALLROOM HAS A BACK DOOR. WHAT ELSE?
if BLAIR SAW ME, SHE'D BE FURIOUS.
then IT'S A GOOD THING YOU'LL BE WEARING A MASK.
on THE UPPER EAST SIDE, APPEARANCES ARE OFTEN DECEIVING. FROM FRIENDS TO HAIR COLOR,
there's ALWAYS MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE.
is UPTOWN THIS WAY OR THAT WAY?
it's, UH, THAT WAY,
and THESE THINGS WHIZZING BY HERE- THEY'RE CARS.
you MIGHT WANT TO AVOID THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT?
you'll SEE BETTER WITHOUT THIS, TOO. WHOA. THAT IS BETTER.
Hey, YOU GOT A NAME?
Hi. JACK ALTMAN. I JUST STEPPED OUT FOR SOME AIR.
Altman? OKAY.
come ON. THANK YOU.
wait. LET ME SEE.
okay, LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE COMPLETELY MORALLY OPPOSED TO SOCIETY EVENTS AND STUFF, BUT
we'll DEPROGRAM YOU LATER. THIS IS UGLY.
just GO.
all RIGHT. THANKS.
thank YOU SO MUCH. ANYTIME.
what WAS IT WE SAID ABOUT APPEARANCES?
Yes, THEY CAN BE DECEIVING.
but MOST OF THE TIME, WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET.
Hey.
have YOU SEEN THAT GIRL I WAS WITH?
when I GRABBED HER BAG, I GOT HER HOUSE KEYS, TOO.
what IS NATE DOING?
he's SUPPOSED TO GO FIND KATI AND IS.
it's GETTING LATE, AND I'M LOSING HEAT. WELL, YOU LOOK RAVISHING.
if I WERE YOUR MAN, I WOULDN'T NEED CLUES TO FIND YOU.
or TO RAVISH ME, I'M SURE. WHO IS THAT?
probably SOME BITCH FROM CHAPIN.
hot BITCH FROM CHAPIN.
forget HER. GO GET NATE. POINT HIM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
first THINGS FIRST.
well, HELLO, ANGEL.
you MUST BE MY LUCKY NIGHT.
and WITH TASTE TO BOOT.
apparently NOT.
I'm TALKING TO YOU.
beautiful AND MEAN? I'VE GOT CHILLS.
care TO DANCE WITH A POOR DEVIL?
why DON'T WE JUST SKIP ALL THAT AND, UH,
go SOMEWHERE QUIET TO TALK?
I'll GET THE CHAMPAGNE.
find ME IN FIVE.
taking A COMPANY PUBLIC IS AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY.
there's NOTHING MORE VALUABLE THAN MAKING A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION.
and YOU TAUGHT ME THAT, ELEANOR. CAPTAIN, YOU KNOW THAT I ADORE YOU,
but YOU'VE NEVER DONE FASHION BEFORE.
I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO CALVIN'S PEOPLE, AND I HAVE TO SAY,
the PRESENTATION IS VERY IMPRESSIVE. ENOUGH BUSINESS TALK, HOWARD. YOU'RE BORING HER.
Mm. ELEANOR, I'VE BEEN THINKING.
when NATE AND BLAIR GET ENGAGED,
she SHOULD HAVE MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER'S RING,
the ONE THAT CORNELIUS VANDERBILT GAVE HER?
you STILL SPYING ON HIM?
I'm NOT SPYING. I'M JUST...
keeping TRACK OF HIS WHEREABOUTS.
well, SO LONG AS YOU'RE WATCHING, HE'S WINNING.
if YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE A MAN JEALOUS,
there's ONLY ONE THING TO DO. RUFUS, I INVITED YOU HERE FOR MANY REASONS,
but KNOWLEDGE OF ROMANCE IS NOT...
that WAS, UM...
unexpected.
give HIM 20 MINUTES.
I NEED A DRINK. I NEED A DRINK.
so EVERY TIME WE SEE THEIR YACHT NOW,
we JUST PULL OUT OUR AIR HORNS AND LET 'EM RIP.
Wow. I TELL YOU, IT IS ALMOST ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU NEVER WANT TO SUMMER IN NEWPORT AGAIN.
wow, THAT SOUNDS, UH, AWFUL.
it IS. IT'S PRETTY BAD.
Yeah, YEAH, UM, YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I, UH, I THINK I'M GONNA GO AND-- CHANGE PARTNERS?
Hey.
Dan, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M SAVING YOU.
I DON'T NEED TO BE SAVED. REALLY? 'CAUSE, UH, I COULD SEE YOUR EYES ROLLING TO THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD FROM ACROSS THE ROOM. DAN.
Hey. BLAIR SENT US OVER.
she SAID IT'S GETTING LATE, AND YOU'RE TAKING TOO LONG.
your LADY-IN-WAITING IS CLOSER THAN YOU THINK,
her HEADDRESS IS FEATHERS OF BLACK AND PINK.
it's HER. IT'S ME.
what? I'M SORRY.
just FIND SERENA.
she'll LEAD YOU TO BLAIR.
Serena. RIGHT.
let's PLAY A GAME. I'D SAY STRIP POKER, BUT I DON'T HAVE MY CARDS.
how ABOUT, UH, HIDE-AND-SEEK?
you HIDE. I'LL SEEK.
and HOW WILL YOU FIND ME? I DON'T HAVE ANY BREAD CRUMBS.
well, YOU CAN LEAVE ME A TRAIL WITH YOUR CLOTHES.
what ARE YOU REALLY DOING HERE, DAN?
what AM I DOING HERE? I RAN ACROSS THE CITY.
I RENTED A TUXEDO. I STOLE THIS MASK FROM SOME DRUNKEN KID,
only TO LOOK LIKE ROBIN.
I FOUND MY WAY IN HERE, ALL TO SEE YOU. I CARE.
well, YOU DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE THIS MORNING,
when YOU WERE WITH ANOTHER GIRL AND LIED TO ME. WHAT? WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I-I DIDN'T--WELL... I DID.
Yeah. I DID, BUT I CAN EXPLAIN.
go AHEAD. GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.
I WAS WITH MY FRIEND VANESSA.
we're VERY CLOSE, AND SHE MOVED AWAY TO VERMONT LAST YEAR,
and NOW SHE'S BACK.
okay, SO WHY'D YOU LIE AND SAY IT WAS JENNY?
because I'M AN IDIOT.
I D--I DON'T KNOW WHY. I...
look, VANESSA AND I...
our RELATIONSHIP IS A LITTLE COMPLICATED,
or IT WAS, BEFORE I MET YOU.
and HONESTLY, I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO GET IN THE WAY OF YOU INVITING ME TO THIS...
stupid PARTY.
well, I WAS GONNA INVITE YOU.
Really?
so NOT INTO, UH,
you're SAYING YOU'RE NOT INTO OLD FRIEND VANESSA?
that IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING.
Oh, YES,
the OTHER PART WE LOVE ABOUT A MASQUERADE?
when THE MASK FINALLY COMES OFF AND THE TRUTH IS REVEALED TO ALL.
will YOU EXCUSE ME?
I JUST SAW THE LAST PERSON I EVER EXPECTED TO SEE.
Yeah. HOW CAN I SAY NO TO THAT?
I'm SORRY.
Vanessa. VANESSA. HEY.
this IS A SURPRISE.
funny. I COULD SAY THE SAME THING.
What--what ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M WRITING AN AMERICAN HISTORY PAPER.
wait. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE YOU.
when DID WE START LYING TO EACH OTHER? I-I MERELY REFRAINED FROM SHARING THE TRUTH,
which WOULD HAVE SOUNDED A LOT MORE LIKE A LIE THAN WHAT I TOLD YOU. HUMPHREY.
I'm--I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT EITHER, I ADMIT,
but WHAT WAS I GOING TO SAY? THAT I WAS RENTING A TUXEDO
to ATTEND A MASKED BALL WITHOUT A MASK OR AN INVITATION
to GO GET A GIRL WHO NOT ONLY HAS A MASK AND AN INVITATION,
but ANOTHER DATE? AT LEAST IT'S HONEST.
you--you HATE THIS WORLD. SO DO YOU, OR SO I THOUGHT.
all RIGHT, WHAT'S GOING ON EXACTLY?
did YOU FOLLOW ME HERE TO PROVE THAT I WAS LYING?
Yes, DAN, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I STALKED YOU BECAUSE I AM JUST SO OBSESSED WITH YOU.
wait. DON'T STOP THERE.
you're THE WHOLE REASON I CAME BACK TO NEW YORK, 'CAUSE I JUST COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU. ALL RIGHT, I GET THE POINT. YOU CAN LAY OFF THE SARCASM
how ABOUT I LAY OFF THE WHOLE EVENING? BYE. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, STOP.
hold ON. LISTEN. I'M--I'M SORRY.
I'm SORRY THAT I LIED ABOUT WRITING A TERM PAPER. YOU SAID YOU LOVE ME.
loved YOU...
in THE PAST AND IN A PRESHAVING, 16-YEAR-OLD KIND OF WAY.
you KNOW, I MEAN, THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
clearly.
looks LIKE SOMEONE'S TRADED UP.
so THAT'S, UM...
Vanessa, YEAH. SHE'S...
beautiful.
I-I-I HAVE TO GO AFTER HER. I'M SORRY.
feel FREE TO FIND ME.
I FOUND YOUR PANTS.
well, YOU'RE GETTING WARMER,
which IS AN ACHIEVEMENT CONSIDERING YOU'RE ALREADY HOT.
well, YOU BETTER HOPE IT DOESN'T GET COLD.
what IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
what THE HELL?!
Hey, MY PHONE IS IN MY PANTS, AND I'M STUCK UP HERE, BITCH!
Vanessa, WAIT, PLEASE.
why WON'T YOU WAIT? COME HERE--OH.
because YOU'RE NOT VANESSA. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
case OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY.
ironically, NOT INVOLVING MASKS.
there YOU ARE.
Oh, I JUST NEEDED A MOMENT.
that-- WHAT JUST HAPPENED-- THE KISS?
Yeah, IT MADE ME FEEL A LITTLE-- NOSTALGIC?
nauseous. RIGHT, UM, OUCH.
no, I'M--I'M KIDDING, KIND OF.
I'm SORRY, RUFUS.
I-I--MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED YOU HERE.
right, UM, AND, UM,
I'm SORRY I KISSED YOU, BUT I DID IT BECAUSE
that MERCENARY IN THE STARCHED WHITE SHIRT
he DOESN'T APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE OVER AN ATTRACTIVE 25-YEAR-OLD MANNEQUIN.
cause BEAUTY FADES,
though YOURS HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB OF HOLDING ON,
and IN THE LONG RUN, IT'S GONNA BE HIS LOSS.
and I THOUGHT HE SHOULD KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO LOSE YOU.
cause TRUST ME, IT'S NOT FUN.
I THINK IT WORKED.
Lily, MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT?
if YOU'LL EXCUSE US.
happy TO HELP.
she MEANS NOTHING.
Jenny? HEY.
um, LOOK, YOU DIDN'T SEE ME HERE, OKAY?
Yeah, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. JUST ONE IN A SERIES OF THINGS I'LL PRETEND DIDN'T HAPPEN TONIGHT. IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
I'm NOT SURE. DAN SURPRISED ME BY SHOWING UP HERE.
well, GO, DAN! YEAH, EXCEPT THEN HE THREW ME FOR A LOOP BY CHASING AFTER SOME GIRL NAMED VANESSA.
no, VANESSA'S DAN'S BEST FRIEND. YEAH, WELL, THEY SEEMED LIKE A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT.
they've KIND OF GOT A HISTORY, DON'T THEY?
sure.
but, I MEAN, DAN'S NEVER LIKED A GIRL LIKE HE LIKES YOU.
really. I MEAN, COME ON. HE'S AT A MASKED BALL,
and I THINK HE'D GO BASICALLY ANYWHERE WITH YOU...
except FOR MAYBE THE ICE CAPADES 'CAUSE THAT REALLY FREAKED HIM OUT WHEN HE WAS 5.
you KNOW WHAT? I...
I THINK I'LL GO AND TRY TO FIND HIM.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA FIND ANYONE.
this STUPID MASK KEEPS FALLING OVER MY EYES.
well, I'D GIVE YOU MINE, BUT MASKS COME OFF AT MIDNIGHT,
and I KIND OF NEED MY DISGUISE TO GET OUT OF HERE.
you KNOW WHAT? YOU WANNA TRADE?
sure.
Thanks.
and HERE, TAKE THIS. IT'S SO HOT IN HERE,
and YOU'LL PROBABLY BE COLD OUTSIDE.
here YOU GO.
did YOU HAVE FUN TONIGHT?
it WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED.
good.
okay, LET'S SEE. HERE.
Oh, THANKS. PRETTY.
Serena, JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING AND LET ME EXPLAIN.
I've BEEN TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING, BUT IT'S KILLING ME.
look, I KNOW WE BOTH CARE ABOUT BLAIR, BUT MAYBE THE BEST THING IS FOR ME TO JUST TELL HER THE TRUTH.
I'm NOT OVER YOU, AND I THOUGHT I COULD FIGHT IT, BUT I CAN'T.
and IF YOU DON'T STOP ME, I'M GONNA KISS YOU.
Nate, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT.
you HAVE TO FIND BLAIR. LOOK, OKAY, WHATEVER.
just FORGET THE CLUE. SHE'S WEARING BIG, TALL BOOTS
and A BIG OLD CROWN. JUST GO, OKAY? HURRY.
Serena, HAVE YOU SEEN NATE? HEY!
it's MIDNIGHT! MASKS OFF!
Serena! SERE--SERENA, WAIT.
I'm SO SORRY. SERENA!
little JENNY HUMPHREY MANAGES TO GET MY PANTS OFF AND HAVE ME NOT ENJOY IT.
quite THE ACCOMPLISHMENT.
good THING SOMEONE ELSE AT THE PARTY WAS AS LECHEROUS AS YOU,
or YOU'D STILL BE UP ON THAT ROOF, AND, NO,
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU HAD TO DO TO GET THAT TUX.
this IS ME.
all RIGHT, CHUCK, I'LL SEE YOU IN THE A. M.
Unh-unh. NO, YOU DIDN'T FIND ME BY MIDNIGHT.
no HAPPILY EVER AFTER FOR YOU.
Blair, I'M--I'M SORRY.
all I WANTED WAS FOR US TO START OVER,
and YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY.
well, AT LEAST SOMEBODY'S HAVING A GOOD NIGHT.
Hello?
Serena, HEY. WHAT-- WILL YOU PLEASE JUST TALK TO ME?
please. WHY DID YOU RUN AWAY FROM ME?
wait. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
you're THE ONE THAT RAN AWAY. I DON'T THINK SO.
blonde HAIR, YELLOW DRESS, BLACK FURRY THING?
there IS ONLY ONE SERENA VAN DER WOODSEN.
Yeah, NO, NOT TONIGHT.
let ME SAY...
for THE RECORD...
I LIKE YOU.
only YOU.
well, THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE I FEEL THE SAME ABOUT YOU.
I'm GLAD THAT'S CLEARED UP.
Hey, UM, YOU KNOW,
I HEAR THE ICE CAPADES ARE COMING TO TOWN.
Mm. IF YOU'RE THERE, SO AM I.
Hey.
you GUYS ARE UP LATE.
we WERE CELEBRATING.
Eleanor WALDORF HAS AGREED TO LET YOUR FATHER'S FIRM TAKE HER COMPANY PUBLIC.
Congrats. THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
it IS, WHICH IS WHY I WAS LOOKING FOR A WINE OPENER
so I COULD SURPRISE YOUR FATHER WITH A BOTTLE OF MARGAUX,
which IS HOW I FOUND THIS.
well, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF, NATE?
what?
well, IT ISN'T MINE, AND IT ISN'T YOUR FATHER'S,
so THAT ONLY LEAVES ONE OTHER PERSON IN THIS HOUSE.
Hey, YOU'RE STILL UP.
Yeah, NOT THAT TIRED. WELL, I AM. I'M EXHAUSTED.
I ENDED UP GOING TO THAT BALL, ACTUALLY.
Oh, REALLY?
Yeah.
well, YOUR NIGHT'S NOT OVER.
there's SOMEONE HERE TO SEE YOU.
PIEROGIS? I COME IN PEACE.
great. 'CAUSE I'M STARVING.
look
save IT, HUMPHREY. YOU'VE NEVER DONE CONTRITE WELL.
besides, I'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD APOLOGIZE.
no, REALLY, I AM. I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT SERENA.
and I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU. WELL, I SHOULDN'T HAVE LIED ABOUT TONIGHT.
and I SHOULDN'T HAVE RUN OUT ON YOU.
look, IF WE'RE GONNA BE FRIENDS AGAIN,
we're GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE THIS STUFF OUT.
you're RIGHT,
and I'VE MISSED HAVING A FRIEND.
I've MISSED BEING ONE.
we CAN START SLOW, WITH THE BASICS.
like, UH, FEWER LIES, MORE UKRAINIAN FOOD.
and YOU TELLING ME ABOUT EVERYTHING I MISSED WHILE I WAS GONE,
such AS SERENA.
well, SHE'S PRETTY FANTASTIC,
almost AS GOOD AS THIS PIEROGI.
Yeah, SHE'S GOT THIS CRAZY MOTHER WHO'S ALWAYS, LIKE,
sparring WITH ME, AND THIS-AND THIS BEST FRIEND WHO'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO DEAL WITH.
the BEST FRIEND HAS A BOYFRIEND WHO'S HARD FOR ME TO DEAL WITH.
gossip girl here
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
how's your mom doing with the divorce and everything?
so my dad left her for another man.
she lost 15 pounds, got an eye lift.
it's been good for her.
my mom kind of left us a couple months ago.
my dad and my sister don't really see that.
I don't know what's happened with my wife or my marriage, and you showing up here randomly doesn't make figuring that out any easier.
am I the only one who thinks this is extremely weird?
forget about it. If dad can let it go, so can you.
I can't believe you didn't tell me your mom came home.
your wife despises me.
I wouldn't say that. - Well, she did.
you should deal with your father.
he needs you. - I don't.
we broke up, okay?
he was gonna get back together with me, but only so my mom would help his dad.
I need your support here, son, and your trust.
well, you better hope for your sake they don't call your son to the stand.
do you like me?
define "like."
as per gossip girl's thanksgiving tradition,
I'm trading my laptop for stove top, and for the next 16 hours, the only thing I'm dishing is seconds.
when the cat's away, the mice will play.
have fun, little rodents.
I mean, who gets wastedon thanksgiving?
the holidays are lonely for people.
I wanted to keep 'em company.
Thanksgiving last year you're looking for a girl your mom is freaking out, so my mom is freaking out.
what, which means you freak out?
Blair, just cut the cord. Go nuts. Come on. Let's do shots.
come on!
I told Lily that you were buying a pie.
Oh, pie.
where is your purse?
uh, my purse...
Oh, great. All right.
you stay here, okay? I'm gonna go look.
don't drink or hit on anything.
Pie's been secured.
Thanksgiving no longer needs to be canceled, all right?
Hey, mom, you know, I need to go. I'm sorry. Bye.
Oh, man.
Hey! What are you doing?
Hey, right of way, pal.
screw you, buddy!
Hey, uh, excu--excuse me.
d-do you need, like, a crossing guard or a cab maybe?
Oh, pie.
it's more like roadkill now, but, uh, better it than you, right?
I'm--I'm Dan...
Hi. - Hi.
uh, I don't know. We met last year. Uh.
you m--you might not remember.
Yeah, I--you probably don't, but look, you should be more careful.
you need to keep your hands off of her. - Blair!
trying to take advantage of her on the holidays. Come on. Let's go, Serena.
Bye, dave. - Bye. Bye.
Bye, Serena.
Hey.
and hello to you.
big national holiday. You excited?
kind of am.
might be the first thanksgiving in a while that I actually remember.
Yeah, I bet.
huh? - Nothing.
uh, you-- uh, you at Blair's?
almost. Her dad's gonna be home for the first time since he left, so she's really excited.
Oh, well, family reunions are all around then.
uh, we, too, have a full Humphrey household.
hopefully, it'll stick.
well, it seems like your mom is really trying.
better thanksgiving than never.
call me between every course?
okay. - Mwah. Bye.
mom, is it really okay to cook with this much heavy cream?
our arteries give us a free pass on turkey day.
it's a shame our family doesn't have a few hundred more members.
do you think I bought too much?
only by several tons.
but it's our first holiday back. I wanted to make sure it was special.
I think they call that guilt.
Yeah, I guess they do.
but if it means more midnight turkey sandwiches for all of us, then so be it.
Yeah, see, Dan?
uh, we on this side of the kitchen choose to be positive.
Yeah, Dan.
what's it gonna be?
you with us or against us?
fine. Fine. But only if I can take the cranberry sauce out of the can.
that is my specialty.
I have to find this recipe before my dad gets here.
Harold Waldorf's famous pumpkin pie.
well, it may have been Bobby Flay's, but it didn't stop my dad from taking credit for it.
it's gonna be perfect!
look at you. Quite the chipper sous-chef.
well, I'm in a good mood.
it happens.
sometimes 'cause I increase my lexapro, sometimes because my dad's in town.
and sometimes, mostly because things are good with a boy.
you and Nate get back together?
you mean since "gossip girl" published pictures of him and some skank?
so that's a no.
what's Chuck doing today?
why are you asking me?
well, you guys are friends.
and, Blair, look, you know you can tell me anything.
I'd be the last person to judge anyone.
with good reason.
Blair, I saw you with Chuck.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I mean, sleeping with him once, maybe you could understand, but twice?
wait. You slept with him?
what happened to no judging?
I'm not, but I thought you wanted to wait.
I thought you wanted to make things special.
Oh, so Nate gets the free pass, and I'm the slut?
tell me you didn't sleep with Chuck for revenge.
well, it wasn't because I like his natural musk, and besides, nothing hurts more than sleeping with the best friend, right?
way to prove a point.
well, I learned from the master.
if you're sleeping with Chuck, I'd say the student's become the master.
are you jealous you didn't get to sleep with him first?
there had to be somebody left on the upper east side.
Blair, darling, are you going to help me at all?
Serena, do you know when your mother's arriving?
she's not.
we're not doing thanksgiving here anymore.
Why?
because I uninvited them.
happy holidays, Eleanor.
mom, I know it's my fault that we're here, but let's not get crazy.
well, I don't know what you're complaining about.
I'm just trying to provide my family with a home-cooked meal.
you don't know how to cook.
well, don't blame me. Talk to your sister.
she's the one that got us exiled from the Waldorfs.
Oh, I'm sorry.
and even if you did cook, we don't have an oven.
preaching to the converted, Eric.
look, we'll just pick up a few things and try to make do.
like peking duck on thanksgiving.
not a bad idea.
no, mom.
all the other shops are closed.
there's nothing wrong with having chinese food on thanksgiving.
what? - Jews having been doing it on Christmas since forever.
look, a pumpkin.
isn't this...this is festive, yes?
we're gonna eat a pumpkin?
mom.
so you couldn't make it past the salad, huh?
I opened the cranberries. My work is done.
how's Blair's?
uh, I wouldn't know.
she gave me the boot.
Wh--she kicked you outof her house?
what happened now?
uh, don't ask, but the good news is, my mom is gonna slice us up a pumpkin.
Oh, and there's duck.
no, no, no. You can't eat duck and raw pumpkin on thanksgiving.
uh, you know what?
I'm the guardian of Vanessa's sister's van for the weekend, and we here at the Humphrey manor have an oddly large kitchen table.
what are you suggesting?
these smell great.
Yes, so we can starvein a fragrant hotel room.
we're not starving.
look, I got us into this mess, so I'm gonna get us out of it.
elaborate, Serena.
Thanksgiving at the Humphreys.
Dan invited me, and Eric'sfriends with his sister, and his dad's really cool.
awesome. I'm leaving the pumpkin.
what do you say, mom?
Thanksgiving. Last year
found it.
sous-chef, you're needed.
ready and awaiting orders.
I see we have extra help.
Yes, well, Serena's spending thanksgiving with us this year.
Ah, the more the merrier.
happy to have you, my dear.
Yes!
the canap were a huge success.
I saved one for you, Blair.
I'm not really hungry.
well, what does that mean, you're not really hungry?
well, I had, like, 15 of them this morning when d...first made them.
15?
do you think that's wise?
darling, she's fine.
she has been for two months.
what did the doctor say?
don't drive us crazy, okay? So, please.
Ah, fine.
we are going to need to set another place at the table.
laurel brought one of the models I'm working with.
do I know her? What's her name?
his name is Roman.
not this one, Harold.
we have to work together.
Hey, you!
happy thanksgiving. Good to see you. - You, too.
want one? - Ah, sure.
good boy.
Nate the great.
so what'd I miss? - Mm, nothing.
you're about to witness the return of sober Serena.
Oh, Nate! - oh, no. Oh, no.
or maybe not.
sweetie, would you take her upstairs? Put her in the bath before your mother gets wind of this whole situation?
what, and leave you all alone?
Thanksgiving is our thing.
Nate, will you please take care of her?
please?
Oh, I will. Come on.
here. - D..., can I help with the pumpkin pie?
of course.
thank you.
crush them. - Thank you very much. Crush them.
caterers?
what's going on here?
everyone is getting ready for our lovely dinner, and you should be, too.
everyone except dad...Where is he?
I thought you knew.
knew what?
coming.
he didn't tell you?
he decided to stay in paris.
he's got either too much work, or Roman is too much work? Who knows?
I-I don't understand.
if he wasn't coming, why wouldn't he just call me and tell me himself?
darling, you should know by now that your father is not a fan of the difficult conversation.
now why don't you run along and change into something a little more...
enchanting?
that's good.
are you sure you don't want us to stay with you?
Yeah, we don't wantto leave you, mom, if you don't feel well.
Oh, no. You kids have fun.
I don't have an appetite anyway.
Oh, hold on a second. That must be Dan.
Hey!
room service.
Oh. Oh, no, no, no, no, sir. You have the wrong room.
Oh, no, you're early.
I lied.
mom.
all I care about is that you two are together.
I don't want to be an imposition.
no.
man with van, at your service.
Hey. - Hey.
uh, bold choice of attire, Mrs. Van der Woodsen, unless it's what they're wearing on the runway these days.
no, my mom sicked out because she didn't want to be imposing.
you know what?
I am fine just curling up and reading a good book.
but you're supposed to be with your family on thanksgiving.
Yeah, and Nicholas Sparksis hardly family.
I'm not taking no for an answer.
in fact, I'm not even asking.
you are coming with us.
I'm adult-napping you.
fine, just stop talking, and I'll get ready.
make it snappy. I'm double-parked.
Thanks.
Hey, Rufus Humphrey. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you.
Rufus, it's Lily.
um, your very persistent son insisted that I join you for dinner.
I want to remind yout hat my kids do not know that we are friendly, and I would like to keep it that way.
that said...
I look forward to seeing you.
how could he just blow me off?
Thanksgiving is our ritual.
you know, he didn't even call?
how hard is it to pick up the phone?
miss Blair, maybe you pick up phone, call your papa.
maybe he tell you the real story.
real story?
with pearls.
tastes good, mom.
thank Godcitarella was still open.
I had to improvise since we were disinvited from the Waldorfs at the last minute.
just like I was asked to step down from the committee for the snowflake ball, and how I wasn't asked back to the lincoln center foundation.
I thought at least, your father's lawyer might join us for dessert.
mom, stop.
you were all foracting like nothing was wrong until it landed on you.
Nate. - I forgot to call the bail bondsman.
maybe he has nowhere to go.
mom, no one is more mad than I am, but this is not the right way.
Nathaniel, I don't need you to fight this fight for me.
where do you think you're going?
anywhere but here.
thank you.
what's taking Dan and Serena so long?
Hey, we're here.
there you are.
you're lucky you made it while the turkey's still hot.
mom, this is Serena, and this is her brother Eric.
it is so nice to meet you both.
it's nice to meet you, too. - Hi.
and this is their mother, Lily.
happy thanksgiving.
just in time, but I thought you were gonna bring pie.
thanksgivng. last year
I did, but it kinda got run over by a taxi, uh, as I was trying to help this girl stay out of traffic.
Ah, well, who needs dessert when we have a real-life hero in our midst?
your brother just saved a girl.
I thought you needed to be near a girl for that to happen.
not just any girl. The girl.
Oh, the blonde you stalk at school?
just the one.
a thing for blondes.
you are your father's son.
not just any blonde.
apparently, I like the ones who get drunk on thanksgiving and almost die.
well, your dad liked 'em dangerous and troubled, too, so...
you were dangerous?
who said I was talking about me?
well, I didn't realize there was anyone else.
well, it is so nice to meet you.
right, it's nice to meet you, too.
Lily, was ? - Yes.
well, I'm just gonna take these coats and put them in, um, Dan's room.
uh, you know what? It's okay. I've got them.
Oh, thank you.
okay, Eric and Jenny, napkin duty.
Serena and Dan, I want every water glass filled, and every candle you can find lit.
I am sorry.
I did not knowt hat you were-- - back?
well, I am.
and why would you know?
well, Dan never mentioned it when he invited me.
I called.
I didn't hear the phone.
you know what? It's fine. It's fine.
let's just have a great time.
this holiday's about sharing. - Right.
and if you don't mind, um, could we not share too much?
I haven't exactly told my kids about my past.
well...
our past.
Hey, turkey's almost room temp, guys.
come on down.
you grab the mashed.
I got that.
happy thanksgiving.
you haven't touched your food.
come on, darling. What has gotten into you?
well, I was going to wait till after dinner, but I guess nowis as good a time as any.
did you call dad and say that I didn't want to see him this thanksgiving?
of course not.
what a ridiculous accusation.
so you didn't tell him that I was so angry at him for leaving, that I didn't even wantto talk to him today?
you had no rightto uninvite him.
when are you gonna get it through your head?
he left us.
he didn't leave us.
he left you.
that's enough.
that's enough.
if you wantto take this up with me, we can discuss it later, after our guests have left.
right now you either eator you leave the table.
I told you, I'm not hungry.
or maybe dessert will change your mind.
where is dad's pie?
I don't see his pumpkin pie.
well, there were so many delicious choices coming from the caterer, we just sent that one down to the doorman.
what is thanksgiving after all, hmm?
now choose one of those amazing desserts.
so, uh, Mrs. Van der Woodsen, um, what were thanksgivings like when you were growing up?
Serena said you were raised in California?
Oh, I grew upon a little ranch in Montecito.
I didn't know there were little ranches.
there aren't.
I don't want to be rude, but I should take this.
Yeah, sure.
Hey, we're right in the middle of di-- yeah. O-of course. I'm on my way.
what's up?
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
is everything all right?
no, but, um, it will be, I hope. I'm sorry.
I can't really say more, but it's nothing about us.
okay. - I was having a lot of fun, though.
Bye. - All right.
I'm sorry, mom. I have to go. - Oh, of course. You're such a good friend.
look, um, I hope you don't mind, but my daughter has to go.
do you need to go with her?
no, no, no, mom. Stay. Have fun, please.
Thanks, guys. it was nice to meet you.
is she gonna be okay?
Yeah, uh, yeah.
I don't think it has anything to do with her, but, um, you were talking about your ranch.
did you have any horses?
Yes, I had a few.
um, I had my own, Rosewood.
my dad has a song called "rosewood."
Oh, but no, not that rosewood.
I completely forgot about that song.
Yeah, it's about my mom.
you know, 'cause she had this perfume that she always wore. And it was rose and...
sandalwood. - sandalwood.
it was like her own personal scent.
I'm a fool.
you're not a fool.
um, raise your handif you're over 30 and acting really weird right now.
I'm sorry, Alison.
I never told Rufus about that horse.
so I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
wait a minute here.
why are you talking like you know each other?
do you two know each other?
uh, we kinda did know each other, a long, long time ago.
what? - Know each other how?
Oh, my god.
this is unbelievable. You know what? I need some air.
don't follow me.
you have a lot of explaining to do.
mom, wait.
may we please be excused?
Yeah, sure.
watch it. Come on. Come on. Come on.
Thanksgiving last year - I don't want a bath. - Oh, too bad.
blair's direct orders.
blair's not the boss of me.
sit. Oh, are you new here?'Cause Blair's the boss of all of us.
Oh, seriously, Serena, you smell like the floor of a brewery.
I do not.
Yes, you do.
Oh, my god.
Yes, I do.
Yeah.
brewery floor with a hint of secondhand smoke?
and a pint of old spice.
I totally need a bath.
Yeah, deal with it.
please.
blair's a bossy genius.
Oh, yes, she is.
so what about you?
what about me?
I don't smell like an ashtray.
but you look like an ass tray.
Hey, Serena. Stop, stop, stop.
stop, Serena.
Serena, stop. What's wrong with you? God.
Oh. Ow. - God.
go away!
Oh, what, what, what, what, what? You started it, dude.
what are you guys doing?
my hair! My--aah!
I got you both!
I'm king of the world. I'm king of the world!
Hey, it's me.
I didn't mean for it to happen.
I didn't see your dad downstairs.
my mother just decides everything, you know?
everything in the world is just totally up to her.
I know.
Hey, why don'twe get out of here?
I'm not going back to that party.
no, I mean, outta here, outta here.
out of this apartment, to a place a little more sane.
any place would qualify.
so you actually threatened Lily Van der Woodsen with physical violence?
mom, you are a badass.
Yeah, well, what can I say?
I was younger thenand wearing steel-toed boots.
no, no. No, we never actually came to blows.
I focused on transformingmy anger into art.
I made some collages.
I wrote a trilogy of 1-act plays about her, named the character Milly, to try to be, you know, subtle.
it's clever.
so what was so bad about her?
and I mean aside from the superior fluttering eyelids and punishing sarcasm.
well, uh, she was your dad's first great love, as she liked to remind me every chance she got.
it's kind of hard to compete with that.
you've uh, been in here for a half-hour.
Yeah, well, not nearly enough time to fathom how you allowed me to walk into this situation.
allowed you?
you were the last person I expected to come through my front door today.
Yeah, well, at the very least, you knew that Serena wouldcome home and tell me all about the wonderful thanksgivingshe had with dan, his father, oh, and his mother.
I don't know what I do or do not owe you.
I mean, we haven'tactually defined what we are to each other.
well, maybe this is the perfect opportunity to do it.
but, Lily...
these past few weeks have...
have been what?
you can't even say it, can you?
I can, but I shouldn't.
look, for better, for worse, you're one of my oldest friends.
oldest friends?
that's certainly not how it felt when you kissed meat Eleanor's party.
what?
Alison, honey...
Dan, will you go and...
uh, check on Jenny and Eric. Yeah.
mom, where's dad?
how dare you do that.
leave in the middle of thanksgiving dinner?
I need to talk to dad.
dad? Dad?
Oh, my god. Dad. Dad. Mom, call 9-1-1. Hurry!
dad, please, wake up. Dad!
easy.
Thanksgiving last year
take a seat, honey.
Oh, goodness. Oh, how do I smell now?
U smell fantastic, but you might not wanna keep asking people that.
Serena, you look wonderful.
that shirt was made for you.
actually, it was made for you.
well, I knew there was a reason I liked it.
yours, too, I see.
and mine.
would you help me with the potatoes? - Yes.
don't tell me it's a big deal. I'm well aware of the stakes.
Hey. Who's dad talking to?
what now? At now? - The office.
something about that deal with the dutch company.
so it looks like I'll have to slip out for a few minutes.
dad, it's a holiday.
not in Amsterdam.
well, we are in America.
tell them it will wait till tomorrow.
sweetheart, I don't want to go. I have to.
I brought this deal in, but if Meltzer closes it without me,
I don't get the commission.
forget the commission.
I'll write you a check myself.
sit. We're just about to eat.
I think I just lost my appetite.
your father and his headaches.
probably took the vicodin and forgot.
had some whiskey, and the next thing you know
mom, seriously, did you hear anything the doctor said?
with what he took, he could have cured 30 headaches.
mom, he's got a problem, and ignoring it almost killed him.
Oh, no. This is not my fault.
I'm not blaming anybody.
you can blame whoever you want, just not me.
all I'm guilty of is trying to make his life easier.
easier?
you've made his life impossible.
what do you mean?
he's had everything he ever wanted just handed to him.
my father set him up with his own firm.
he gave us the house that we live in, the Hamptons, the boat.
he's never had to earn a dime, and how do you think that's working out for him, mom, huh?
wake up!
all he had to do was sit behind a desk, put on a suit and not get arrested, and he couldn't manage to do that.
you want me to give him more responsibility in the family?
look, I don't know what the answer is, but we can't keep going on like this, or else we'll lose him.
excuse me.
sorry to interrupt, but Mr. Archibald is awake.
he was asking for you.
thank you. - You're welcome.
I'll go see how he's doing.
no. I will.
I'm not saying you're overreacting perse, just having a reaction that is above and beyond what is appropriate.
I have been killing myself trying to make up for what happened in hudson.
which is not an overreaction, I might add.
and then I find out that the two of you are making out at theme parties?
Oh, it was hardly making out, and there is an explanation.
Hey, guys. I'm back, and I...brought...blair.
Hey.
weird vibe.
okay.
Where's Dan?
there's no chance we're related, right?
Oh, look at Eric's roots.
what do you mean? What's wrong with my roots?
they're kind of Rufus-like.
Hey. - Serena and Blair.
Blair? - Yeah, it's me.
explanation to follow, but first, what's going on with our parents?
Oh, uh, our dad dated your mom.
Yeah, we're not related, though.
what? - ignore my roots.
wait. Wait. What?
you know what's really weird?
there's a garage doorin the middle of your room.
is that Cedric?
this day just got a lot worse.
hold on. How serious were they--our parents?
uh, I think it's safe to say that they have had sex.
no, no, no. No, I'm gonna faint.
to repeat, we are not related.
she was a groupie, and he was almost famous.
suddenly, my family seems so sane.
this is too much to handle on an empty stomach.
well, we're not going back out there, so...
well, can we leave here then, please?
escape. I don't know. Maybe eat?
well, that's why they call it a fire escape.
I think we're splitting hairshere, Rufus.
an emotional affair is just as bad as a--as a physical one.
Oh, please, nobody's buying that.
emotional affairs are necessary to keep a marriage alive.
and how many times have you been divorced?
Alison, this is not about Lily.
this is about you and me.
exactly, and if we'regonna have any chance, then she can't be here.
what, for thanksgiving?
or ever?
Oh, you can't be serious.
I am
look, I have made mistakes, and I know that, but if she's in your life, you're never gonna get over her.
Alison. - This is it, Rufus, okay?
if you wanna make this work, then you have to make a choice.
mom, is such a hypocrite, and all these years, she's been riding me about my behavior.
and here she's just mad at you for being her.
and all this time, my dad has been giving me this advice based on this girl he dated.
this girl--"a lot like serena."
it's her mom.
when you think about it, it makes total sense that your mom was a groupie.
I mean, only a woman that had completely satisfied her sexual appetite in her youth would ever marry your stepdads.
Blair, can we not talk about mom's appetite?
Yeah. Or who satisfied it.
it's just... - so...
gross. - Yeah.
Hi.
Hey, mom.
is everything okay?
Yeah.
do you--do you wanna go home?
we could call a car.
Oh, no, not yet.
um, I need fries.
excuse me.
could I getsome french fries? And just keep 'em coming.
sure. Coming right up.
uh, we should-- Jenny and I should probably head back to the loft.
I'm gonna go, too.
leave you guys alone.
s. Thank you for today.
the sandwich was delicious.
I'm calling Dr. Sherman tomorrow.
Bye. - Bye.
is that really necessary, mom?
from what I hear, you have been in places far dirtier than this.
well...
please.
try spending nine hours with Jane's Addiction on the Ohio turnpike.
then we'll talk about dirty.
okay.
see you later, Waldorf.
so, uh, so today was not boring.
no.
I never should have asked mom to come home, but I didn't see this coming.
who could've? Don't worry about it.
it's so weird to think that our parents had lives before us, you know?
I know, or that they had lives before each other, huh?
Yeah. Lily seemed pretty upset.
I wonder what happened while we were gone.
uh, I-I don't know, but it looks like we're about to find out.
Hey! Who's in the mood for a little Humphrey family scrimmage?
what'll it be? Kids against the parents? Boys against the girls?
Oh, definitely girls against the boys because last year,I got burned by dan's weak forward pass.
Hey, hey, I was nursinga rotator cuff injury from aught.
come on, mom. Let's go work out our plays. - yep.
so, uh, dad, not that I'm--not that I'm mad, exactly, but not telling me about Serena's mom was extremely uncool.
I should've said something, I know.
and I'm sorry.
given the ick factor alone, I would say that you set my progress back by at least several months.
Oh, come on. You're a Humphrey man.
no daughter of Lily's could ever resist.
how'd you leave itback there with her?
well, I wouldn't be expecting Lily over for dinner anytime soon.
your mom and I need to focus on the future, not the past.
that's a lot easier for all of us without her around.
well...
well, let's play with the old pigskin then.
mom.
here you are.
and here you are.
you had me worried sick.
I know I-I shouldn't have lied to you about your father.
that never stopped you before.
true.
but...
the real truth...
divorce papers from your father, and I'm supposed to sign them.
I haven't yet.
mom...
he's living in Europe...
with a man.
you can't be all that surprised that he wants a divorce.
I'm not, but what I-- what I am surprised about is how it makes me feel.
he was my husband, after all.
my harold...
for almost 20 years.
I couldn't face him...
during the holidays. It was always our happiest time.
why didn't you just tell me that?
and let you choose between the two of us?
I wonder who would've won that battle.
Yeah, I would have been entirely alone.
well, uh, I was anyway.
it's still thanksgiving.
ye .
what do you want to do?
Hey.
Oh, you're still here.
I guess I must have fallen back asleep.
Yeah, you were, uh, you were pretty out of itwhen I first came in.
Where's your mom?
she's getting coffee.
how's your mom?
she's gonna be all right.
we all are.
so...
vicodin and whiskey, huh?
I guess I forgot I took thatmedicine when I took that drink.
dad, we're not doing this anymore.
okay? We're just not.
I know it wasn't an accident.
of course it was.
and when I found you, I thought you were dead.
I'm sorry.
I just didn't...
I couldn't... - yes, you can.
dad, you have to, please.
I know it might not always feel that way, but...
we need you.
dad, we need you.
here you go, Nate.
Ah, thank you, Mr. Waldorf. My dad will appreciate this.
it's a pleasure. - Keep out the gravy. He's got high cholesterol.
Anne, it's thanksgiving. - Mom, seriously.
give the man some gravy.
happy thanksgiving. - Yeah, you, too, man.
all right. See you soon.
good night, sweetheart.
good night.
hello. Happy thanksgiving.
Hey. - Hi.
happy thanksgiving. - You, too.
happy thanksgiving, Blair.
I am looking for my daughter.
where is my little girl?
Hi.
too much turkey?
Bye, Blair.
happy thanksgiving.
Hey, Dan, will you passthe mashed? It's over...
Ahem. What? Oh, yeah, here. I'm sorry.
come on, son. You're asleep at the wheel.
the Humphrey family thanksgiving dinner's a well-oiled machine.
were you still thinking about your dream girl?
what? No.
no, I'm thinking about, um, your stuffing, mom, which looks delicious.
Yeah. - Your stuffing.
well, keep dreaming. You know, maybe one dayshe'll actually know your name.
Yeah, maybe, and then I'll have something to be thankful for.
Oh, shut up.
really.
what's that all about?
gossip Girl here.
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
how's your mom doing?
my dad left her for another man.
something about uh. uh, mom and a neighbor?
Yeah. It's complicated.
mom's having an affair. It's easy for me to say it.
it happened one time, and it's over.
then why did our daughter have to go to Hudson and drag you back here?
I'm sorry I kissed you, but I did it because I thought he should know how it feels to lose you.
so when can we go public?
my kids have to know first.
my friend Vanessa. she moved away to Vermont last year, and now she's back.
you guys just have everything in common, and, um, I'm just getting to know him.
this thing between us.
it's over for good.
Nate is a gentleman.
he would never cause a scene.
where to, Mr. Bass?
the airport.
Hey, upper East siders.
it's Christmas in New York, and along with the season comes the Constance Billard/ St.Jude's bazaar, where the only thing bizarre are the donated items for sale.
how about an antique butter churn?
Oh, my gosh. That would go so well with my loom.
I know what I'm getting you for christmas now.
Oh, for when I move to Siberia? -No.
come on. New york hardly even gets cold anymore, and it never snows.
who wants chestnuts roasted on an open fire when it feels like Florida?
okay, global warming Grinch.
I'm just saying, Christmas should be white and snowy.
I'd even settle for Manhattan slush.
there you are.
Hey, Vanessa. What are you doing here?
Hey. Merry Christmas.
this is a copy of "The New Yorker." Thank you, but you know I already have a subscription.
there's something else in there. A letter.
what does it say, Serena?
dear Mr. Humphrey, we are pleased to advise you "that we would like to publish your short story in our summer fiction issue, featuring '20 under 20.' "
it's a contest for young unknown writers, and I might have...
Oh, my god! -Submitted you.
I'm gonna be published in "The New Yorker. " that. Oh.
this ca. This can't be real.
is. Is this. Is this real?
this is so great.
I haven't even read one of your stories.
Oh, don't worry. He doesn't show them to anyone.
I swiped this one out of his drawer on the pretense of borrowing a stapler.
slick. You never did return that stapler, by the way.
let's see.
you story is called "10-8-05."
what's that date?
Vanessa, thank you.
I don't know how you did this, but this is the best present ever.
I can't believe we just took a cab for $32.
well, I can't believe you were gonna wait an hour for another subway.
they said another train was on its way.
uh, excuse me. Pardon me.
Rufus, Alison, hello. -Hi.
Oh, Rufus. Uh, you remember my friend Bartholomew Bass?
Hi. From, uh, Eleanor's?
Yeah. Hello.
Eleanor's?
Oh, this is my wife Alison.
Hi. -How do you do?
well, it's lovely to see you both.
excuse us, please.
I guess Lily's targeted her next billionaire.
actually, I think she's had him in her sights for a while.
well, that was awkward.
it wouldn't be if you let people know what we were doing together.
I'm just starting to trust you again.
and the only reason you didn't trust me last time was because of a misunderstanding.
Yes, and to avoid another one, please understand that if it doesn't work out between us again,
I'm gonna feel twice as humiliated.
not telling people about us ensures that we don't work out.
look, when I committed myself to you, I meant it.
you know I am in love with you.
what are you waiting for?
Oh, happy holidays. -Happy holidays.
ms. Van Der Woodsen. Mr. Bass, I didn't think that you were still in town.
I figured that you were with. -with Charles? No.
sadly, I am stuck here on business while he suns himself at my hotel in Monaco.
I have my staff keeping an eye on him, and I'll join him for New Year's.
Oh, right. I-I, uh, was wondering why he'd been so quiet, and Monaco answers my question.
lovely to see you two. Bye.
Blair, there you are.
I-I can't talk right now, Serena. I'm late, and I have
a huge sweet tooth?
they're for my dad and me. We get them every year, and he landed from Paris 27 minutes ago.
Oh, then vite, vite! I'll parle while you marche.
come on. I said vite!
Hey!
nice holiday spirit, scrooge! -Oh, gosh.
so it's gonna be a real Waldorf Christmas?
well, a real Waldorf Christmas eve.
Eleanor drew the line at Christmas day.
that's only for me, her and Dorota.
well, you still have a couple days with your dad.
no, it'll be more than just a couple days.
I'm gonna convince him to stay in New York.
what about Paris and Roman?
Roman is a phase.
my father belongs here with me.
he only left New York to ride out the scandal.
time to come home, don't you think?
Hey, did you want to ask me something?
Yes, a gift idea for Dan now that Vanessa got him the most thoughtful Dan-like present ever.
why don't you just buy him a new outfit for Cedric and call it a day?
thank you for being totally not helpful at all.
see you tomorrow night.
Bye.
Hi! -Blair-bear!
Oh, look at you.
more beautiful than ever.
uh, sweetheart, you remember Roman?
you are still perfection.
delicate, yet full with flavor, like a macaron.
imagine my surprise when the elevator door opened and out popped both of 'em.
well, I didn't think you'd mind.
it's the perfect opportunity for you two to get to know each another better.
Absolutely.
it's for you.
Oh, sweetheart, you remembered.
it's, uh, our tradition.
that's for you.
merci, Blair.
my pleasure.
my son, the writer.
published writer.
Yeah, you got your dream girl and your story in "The New Yorker."
maybe you should just die now.
that's true. I may have peaked.
this one is from the Smiths.
"Season's greetings. " That's very original.
their name's Smith. They don't have to be original.
this one is from, uh, Alex.
what?
Alison, meet, meet me on the 24th for.
no, Dan.
and that's not a Christmas card.
why is he writing to you?
sending cards to the house? Asking to see you?
I don't know.
guys, we're. We're still here.
we can hear you.
Rufus, it's over with Alex, okay?
I-I-I'm home now with my family.
good.
let's all rewind and just pretend this never happened.
this is not gonna ruin our Christmas.
I can't believe you're okay with this.
who said I am okay with this?
what am I supposed to do, make a scene?
behave like some pathetic, scorned wife?
no.
Roman does not even know how to ice-skate.
can't you escort him out of the park on your way to the meeting?
maybe drop him at a nail salon?
I cannot bother myself trying to wrestle Roman away from you.
I have to mentally prepare.
I am meeting with the C. E.O. of Victoria's secret, after all.
Victoria's secret? -Yes,
I'm. I'm designing a line of retro-chic sleepwear and lingerie and I...
I'm looking forward to the samples. We're all very proud.
in fact, mom, why don't you tell roman all about it?
I'm sure he'd be fascinated.
it's so good to have you here.
well, it's good to be here.
now where's the handsome Nate? Am I gonna see him tonight?
well, he's in Connecticut with his mom.
he said he would try to catch a train and make it to the party tonight.
Yeah, well, an Eleanor Waldorf soiree.
another New York institution that I miss.
you know, you don't have to miss any of it.
Yeah, well, I wish that I could be in two places at once, my dear, but impossible.
sorry.
you know that chateau near Lyon that I told you about?
Roman and I bought it.
you bought that place? -Yes.
and with Roman?
the house is flooded with light.
the fireplaces are big enough. I mean, you can walk into them.
the gardens are incroyable.
uh, pardon me.
I'm taking my niece skating, and I can't seem to locate the rink.
but it's, it's right over there.
of course. The throng of children in mittens should have tipped me off.
thank you. -You're welcome.
the handsome man was just flirting with you.
that's absurd. He was not flirting with me.
Roman, it is going to be so dull for you to sit and watch them skate.
Yes. Why don't you go to the petting zoo and feed the sheep?
or why don't I join you on the rink?
it looks fun.
wonderful.
Yes. Super.
I'll get you skates. See you there.
super.
you're not autographing those and selling them on Ebay, are you?
no. No, no. I'm just checking out some of the previous publishees, and I'm...
I'm in great company here.
it's "The New Yorker."
V. , how can I top this?
I can't, really, unless I rig the Oscars for one of your documentaries.
you got in on your own merit.
the only gift I gave you was to lick a stamp, and as for me, the annual Dan Humphrey Christmas CD mix is more than enough.
all right, yeah.
Hi!
what's in the bag? -Perfection.
look, I know it's not Christmas yet, but open it, please.
I can't wait. I'm too excited.
Oh, my.
I noticed the other day that you don't wear a watch, and then it occurred to me it's because you don't have a watch, and you're gonna need one to be punctual for all the meetings with editors and publishers now that you're a fancy and apparently, self-important writer.
you don't like it. You want the brown band.
no, no, no. I love the band. I love the whole thing.
it's, it's the most amazing watch I've ever seen, but I can't accept this.
what?
Oh, yes, you can.
look, it's more of a gift for me because I had so much fun picking it out for you.
you have to.
Serena, I buy a book for my dad every Christmas.
I think the most elaborate gift I've ever given has been a pair of rubber boots from L. L. Bean.
so then I overdid it?
I think even your underdoing it would be overdoing it.
look, um, let's, let's, let's set some rules, maybe some helpful guidelines.
fine.
deadline?
um, tomorrow morning.
price limit?
50 bucks.
all right. May the best gift win.
Hey, um. -Hey.
if it's any help, I can tell you Dan's favorite used book shop.
that's okay. I think I got it.
are you Alex?
who are you? -Rufus Humphrey.
unless you want to be carried out of here, you're gonna stay the hell away from my wife.
calm down now.
you sent a letter to my wife at my house where my children live?
whatever you had with her is over.
why don't you sit down?
she told you to leave her alone.
I'm sorry.
that's not what she told me a couple days ago.
excuse me. You, you spoke to her?
you can do it. You can do it.
look at all these children. They're skating around fearlessly.
come on. They got a lot shorter way to fall.
Blair, will you help us here? We need you!
just a second. My laces came undone.
now here we go. Ready?
now go to Blair.
okay. You can do it!
come give us a lesson.
spotted spinning at wollman rink. The Blair Capades.
all the grace of Nancy Kerrigan, but packing the punch of Tonya Harding.
Pauvre Roman.
are you all right?
I'm so clumsy. My foot got caught behind the skate.
here. Let me help you.
I cannot believe that daddy decided to stay with Roman instead of having tea at the Carlyle with me.
the E. R. Doctor said he would make a full recovery.
everything is ruined.
why would you say that?
you and I had a marvelous time.
well, I'm sorry, mother. It's just not the same.
I don't understand how that French fox stole my father and your husband and always seems to come off like a-an innocent lamb.
Roman was not always so innocent, you know.
Really? What's his story?
mm, well, when I first met him, he was going out with this model named Freddy, and Freddy was a horrible scoundrel.
Roman would actually be into somebody like that?
into him? He was. He was absolutely infatuated with him.
Freddy had him under some kind of spell.
I was the one who got him to break out of it and turn his life around.
don't mention Freddy to your father.
it is a sore subject.
okay.
what was Freddy's last name?
Hey. Where were you?
I tried to call you, but your phone was off.
I kept your date for you with Alex.
he's actually a pretty cool guy other than the fact that he's in love with my wife.
he told me about your phone call.
he felt that I owed him an explanation, and he was right.
and you didn't tell me that because?
because there was nothing to tell.
I told Alex that I was back with my family and to stop calling.
would you have come back, if Jenny hadn't shown up to bring you?
if I hadn't, would Lily be here right now?
I guess by turning our backs on these other people, we thought we could fix ourselves.
maybe other people aren't the problem.
maybe we changed.
and at what point do we admit that no matter how much we want it or how hard we try, it's just not working.
I know it's been maybe ten minutes since I last asked, but are you still sure you don't want to talk about it?
dad said he didn't want to ruin Christmas. That's what I'm trying to do.
Hey, well, just in case you change your mind.
you're here. I know.
okay. How about this?
at least you know it's something Serena doesn't have.
a year of cheese for $600? Are these people kidding?
I could buy a cow for that much money and make my own cheese.
you just said "make my own cheese. " That's disgusting.
I'm never gonna find this gift for Serena.
Yeah, and your gift needs to be especially good this year to make up for the rest of her Christmas.
what do you mean?
well, she's living in a hotel. You know, how homey can it be?
it's not exactly festive.
Eric told me they don't even allow trees.
leave a message, and I might listen.
Chuck, you are not answering my calls, to torture me, I am sure, but please, for the love of god, do not tell anybody about us, okay?
please? Please.
Hey. You told me to come right away. Is everything all right?
Yeah. -Why aren't you with your dad?
uh, I need your log-in for your agency's site from your modeling days.
my modeling days? I did one print ad for Gap when I was 12.
what, are you holding an open call or something?
I have one specific look in mind.
uh, okay, well, I don't know if it'll still even be in here, but.
well, look at that.
addresses and phone numbers. Perfect.
you know, I called you an hour ago. B. T. W. You're late.
um, you're lucky. I'm even here at all. It's christmas eve, and I still haven't found a gift for Dan.
now all the stores are closing, and I'm totally screwed.
do you have any idea what you can buy for under $50 these days?
three-quarters of a DVD box set?
maybe a pair of Wolford stockings.
Oh, stockings. Yes, great idea for Dan.
Blair, please, this is serious.
I don't know. Why don't you buy him a gold money clip from Cartier, say it's $49. 99?
he won't know the difference.
what are you doing anyway?
I'm booking me a model.
I come to you hat in hand, tail between my legs and off my high horse.
I spent the entire day searching for the perfect gift for Dan.
now all the stores are closing, Christmas day is looming, and, um.
I need your help.
I could take this opportunity to gloat, but I actually like you.
so let's get down to business.
what do you have so far?
um, I found a first edition J. L.Hall book, original Italian poster of the "400 Blows" and a Montblanc fountain pen.
all very thoughtful. -And all exceed $50.
right.
well, Dan's not really that into things，Which makes shopping for him kind of hopeless.
the only thing he wants for Christmas is snow. It's not like I can give him that.
you sure?
welcome. Welcome.
I don't know if you've noticed. We're doing things a little untraditionally this year.
I don't know if you've heard.
I'm designing a line of lingerie for Victoria's Secret.
I walked into the store, and I fell in love with this tree.
isn't that lipstick clever? Isn't it?
good. Have some eggnog.
Hello?
Hey. It's me. -Hey.
so, uh, running into each other at the school fair. Kind of awkward.
I suppose so, especially after our last phone call.
Rufus, we really shouldn't be speaking.
no, I know.
but if there's something you want to say, you should go ahead and say it.
is there something you want me to say?
why are you calling?
Oh, I just wanted to say Merry Christmas.
hope you have a good holiday.
Yes, well.
I'm, um, flying to Anguilla with Bart tonight, so I'm expecting it to be a-a great holiday.
one for the ages, in fact.
good night, Rufus. Good-bye.
Anguilla.
what is the matter with me?
I don't think so.
excuse me.
what are you doing here?
well, I was hoping to see you again.
I thought it is great good fortune that Roman tracked me down at the skating rink and extended an invitation.
Oh, well.
enjoy the party.
how dare you invite a strange man into my home?
Jack came?
go talk to him. Bring vodka.
you practically picked him up off the street.
and then I googled him. His name is Jack Roth.
he owns a prominent hedge fund with offices in London and Barcelona, and he finds you very attractive.
well, that's no excuse, and.
and. And I am doing just fine without your romantic help.
are you?
Eleanor, we've been friends for a long time.
since before Marc Jacobs went into rehab.
friends don't steal other friends' husbands.
is Nate there?
a few hours ago?
Chuck Bass didn't call for him, did he?
uh, never mind. Did Nate say where he was going?
no, no. Don't. Don't disturb Mrs. Archibald.
um, I'm sure he's on his way here now.
all right. Thank you.
dorota's gonna kill you if you get glue on that comforter.
sorry we've turned your room into an art studio, B. , but the clock is ticking.
I'm done.
Oh, my gosh.
that, that's amazing.
thank you so much, Vanessa. This is gonna be incredible.
good. I'm glad I could help.
I think he'll really love it.
I think I'd like to help with this little project.
would you come and help me find another pair of scissors?
it's so nice what you're doing for your friend Dan, helping his girlfriend make his Christmas present.
Serena is so grateful because she likes to see the best in people.
I like to see the truth.
yeah? And what's that?
I think you like Dan a little too much.
just thought I should let you know someone's watching.
merry Christmas.
I'm taking off. Call me when you're done?
okay. Where you going?
I'm gonna go check on my daddy.
I thought you were gonna help.
I think my work's done here.
Oh, hello.
Hi. -Good-bye.
when you two are done hiding up here, I'm taking you both out for dessert.
can't, mom. I'm busy.
but this is important for our family. It'll just be the three of us.
mom, anytime you say it'll just be the three of us, it means you're dating someone new.
whoever it is, I don't care. I'll just meet him at the wedding.
fine, fine.
then I will just tell you who it is, because you're gonna be seeing him around from now on.
it's Bart Bass. -Bart Bass?
mom, you cannot date Bart Bass.
you just said a moment ago you didn't care who it was.
that was before I knew who it was.
he only has one facial expression. He scares me.
and he raised chuck. That scares me.
Oh, Serena, as usual, you're being overly dramatic.
I'm not marrying Bart.
this is very casual, and regardless, I'm not asking your permission.
you know when I suggested this plan, I didn't know that it would entail a robbery.
Hey, hey, hey. I left a donation.
so it was more of a rescue than a robbery.
you know, those abandoned trees in that lot were just gonna be kindling the day after Christmas, and this tree that we have here is gonna be loved and admired.
Oh, yeah, you have a real talent for spin, my brother. Okay.
I wish I had more talent for heavy lifting.
Yeah, well, what you're doing for Serena is really romantic.
I wonder what mom and dad are getting each other for Christmas.
I thought that if I got them under the same roof that things would go back to the way they were.
they haven't, have they?
I think there's a real possibility that they might split up.
if I hadn't brought her back, though, we could've just kept pretending that she's just in Hudson doing her art.
you did the right thing, Jen.
really, you did,'cause whatever happens now, at least, uh, we're not living in a fantasy, you know?
wonderful party, Eleanor.
so you. Ice-skate?
occasionally, with my niece, but she's much more talented than I am.
well, I haven't skated since ages, but I used to love it when I was a girl.
you must have been very beautiful out there on the ice.
excuse me.
Freddy, what on earth are you doing here?
Oh, Roman invited me.
what? -Freddy, what, what are you doing here?
he said that you invited him.
what?
Roman, explain this.
I can't.
and so true.
how does one explain the indescribable pull to see an old lover, to feel that jolt of electricity?
so you couldn't last two days in town without contacting him?
I can't believe you'd trust appearances and not me.
Harold, dear, I.
Roman did not invite Freddy.
I think Blair did.
if you want to be the featured model in my spring catalog, you'd better tell us the truth.
she might have offered to buy me a cruise.
and renew my gym membership.
well, you might as well take that cruise, because you'll be featured in my catalog en hell freezes over.
now please, get out.
thanks for the champagne.
merry Christmas.
looks like daddy's little girl isn't sugar and spice and everything nice after all.
I suppose that was pretty naive.
Blair learned scheming from her mother and unrealistic dreaming from her father.
she tries really hard to act all grown-up, but don't you be fooled.
she's still a little girl who needs her daddy.
okay, stop, stop, stop.
okay.
what now?
now you go in there, you distract Dexter, the humorless concierge.
while I try and sneak this into an elevator.
all right, um, who's gonna turn you into Hercules so you can carry this thing by yourself?
I did. I did not say the plan was foolproof. -Yeah.
Hey, Ms. Van Der Woods. Lily, hi.
tree. Hi.
Yeah, um, they don't allow Christmas trees inside, which is why we're out here.
which is why Dan's about to ask you for a favor.
Ah, does it involve distracting Dexter and sneaking into the elevator?
Why? Would that work?
no. Never.
he has the eyes of a hawk, and he takes his job very seriously.
so I've noticed.
but Bobby at the service entrance.
I think he could be bought.
come.
I just sent him a text, and Dan's on his way.
thank you so much.
it's really no problem, and since there are no problems, I should go.
Oh, no, no, no. Stay, please.
you don't need me. We talked about how to turn everything on.
no, I know I can do it, but i just want you to see Dan's face.
I've really gotta get going. -Okay.
well, I'll tell him how much you did.
please don't.
it's your present. Just enjoy your night.
Hey, this is Nate. I can't come to the ph.
can I come in?
our flight leaves in a few hours. I wanted to say good-bye.
please forgive me, Blair. I should have told you that I was bringing Roman.
I knew that having him here would be hard for you, but I love you so much, and I love roman, and I was hoping that if we were all thrown together, that something perfect would happen and that you would love him, too.
I was gonna convince you to move back to New York, but you bought a vineyard in France with Roman.
what's next, a commitment ceremony?
great.
there's no room in your life for me anymore.
sweetheart, there is always room for you.
no matter where I am, no matter who I'm with.
I, uh.
this is part of your Christmas gift.
your house in France.
it's very nice, daddy.
I'm sure you and Roman will totally enjoy it.
and so will you, because this is your room.
it's beautiful.
we're having it decorated just for you.
a cat.
a cat named "cat," like in your favorite movie.
it was Roman's idea.
so, Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
we're hoping that you'll spend the whole summer with us.
merry Christmas.
do you like it?
do you think it's cheesy?
no.
no, no, it's, it's incredible.
how did you do this?
well, I had help from my elves.
your present is waiting for you at home, but, um,
I did bring a little pre-present for you.
this is your story.
Yeah, it's the original.
it's right out of the spiral notebook.
I'm kinda scared to read it.
what happened on October 8th, 2005?
well, I was accidentally invited to a birthday party where I met a girl.
she only spoke two sentences to me, but I've never forgotten her.
wait. Your story's about me?
are we really gonna do this?
Yeah.
I'm well-connected.
this is, without question, the best Christmas ever.
ever in the history of Christmas.
I hate to break the spell, but, uh, we better get home before our families wake up.
you are a marvel.
Oh, stop it.
who knew there were men like you wandering around Central Park, lost?
Eleanor, good morning, and, Jack, nice to see you.
good morning. -Yes, wonderful.
the flights were all canceled because of the weather. I wanted to tell Blair in person.
do not worry. We, we have a room at the Pierre.
no, it's nonsense. You, you'll stay with us.
thank you.
you'll call me later?
Oh, yes.
I'll be spending Christmas with my family.
Bye.
what's going on?
we're back for Christmas.
well, Roman, you are in for a treat, because a Waldorf Christmas is like no other.
come on, you. Oh.
merry Christmas, dad. You're up early.
and you're getting in awfully late.
Oh, yeah, well, I left you a message.
saying the tree shenanigans were taking all night, but I didn't think you meant literally all night.
Yeah, uh, yeah, the tree. It was a big production.
uh, luckily Serena's mom was there to help with the plan.
Lily was there? I thought you mentioned she was out of the country.
no. No, they're here.
they're gonna go see "the Nutcracker" tomorrow.
do I smell chocolate chip waffles?
with hot caramel sauce.
your father's Christmas specialty.
Dan, pass the chocolate chips.
good morning. -Good morning.
after breakfast and presents, I need to go to the gallery to take care of some stuff.
on Christmas morning?
well, yeah, you know, art never sleeps.
but you know what? The three of us could hang out together.
it'll be great. We'll drink hot cocoa and watch a movie, and then when your dad comes back, we can all go for a walk.
hear those silver bells?
it's Christmas time in the city.
some families actually do make the yuletide gay, managing to leave their troubles far away.
Oh, it's beautiful.
thank you. Thank you.
Oh, look. You look like a brunette Catherine Deneuve.
Quelle magnifique.
it's so gorgeous.
merry Christmas, Dorota.
it's so we can text.
do you like it? -Thank you, miss Blair.
other families have a merry little Christmas even when their troubles aren't so far away.
so what did dad have to do at the gallery, exactly?
uh, paperwork, I-I think.
you're going back to Hudson, aren't you?
but, hey, we are gonna be okay.
come here.
we know.
I'm sorry.
some presents might end up getting returned.
I know how you like Florida.
Yeah. Wow.
uh, number one fan.
you know, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't get anything for you, Mr. Bass, but, uh, I didn't know you'd be coming for Christmas.
Ah, no worries, Eric.
please, call me Bart.
but some gifts are for keeps.
for you. -Thank you.
Eric, Serena, I just want you to know that I have deep feelings for your mother.
mom, your phone.
uh, Lily, you're not gonna want to interrupt this moment.
other presents come when you least expect them.
Hey, Lily.
you know everything's closed on Christmas?
diners that claim to be open 24/7.
it's false advertising.
and everyone knows the biggest present comes in the smallest box.
so, uh, Alison's leaving.
she's spending time alone with the kids.
and I seem to have walked all the way from Brooklyn to your doorstep without a jacket, in the snow.
so what the hell?
I miss you.
and I have been missing you for a while.
would you do me the honor of being my wife?
Fromage! Cheese!
Ah, perfect.
then there are those boxes you wish you had never opened.
Oh, I like the pa.
have a holly jolly Christmas.
X. O.X. O. Gossip girl.
good morning, upper east siders.
gossip girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
top story on my home page-- Serena Van Der Woodsen, everybody's favorite "it" girl has just returned from a mysterious absence and was learning the hard way that you can never go home again.
Serena is back. You'll never believe what's on "Gossip Girl " .
someone saw Serena getting off a train at grand central.
Serena's at school.
why did she return?
let me guess--you told everyone Eric's just visiting grandpa in Rhode island.
your aunt Carol in Miami.
he tries to take his own life, and you're worried it's gonna cost you mom of the year?
must be a lot of rumors why you're back.
none of them mention you.
Nate's gonna wait for Serena.
he can get in line behind that guy.
I don't need some new boy influencing her, distracting her from her needs.
a kid like Dan is exactly what Serena needs.
guess who's dad is cool?
it's a trick question.
Yeah, cause it can't be ours.
you're going out with Serena, and I'm going to kiss on the lips.
who said this family wasn't cool?
I thought everything was good between us.
it was...before I found out you had sex with my boyfriend.
great, just in time for brunch.
I told her to stay away.
I'm not sneaking around with you.
just to talk.
you said you'd never speak to her again.
so you slept with your best friend's boyfriend.
is that true?
then she ran away and lied about it.
poor Daniel-- so little time, so many sluts to defend.
this world, it's-- it's crazy.
and you're a part of it.
Blair, how can I fix this?
you don't, Serena.
you just stay away.
but now that Serena is back, will the upper east side ever be the same?
it takes two tangles, and girls like these don't go down without a fight.
there's plenty of upside to being the spawn of the fabulously wealthy.
but the downside?
super successful parents except nothing less from their offspring.
and when it comes to college, that means the ivies.
it's more than just getting into college.
it's setting a course for the rest of your life.
and for those few who aren't legacies, the pressures are no less.
when parents have sacrificed for their children's futures, what kid would wanna let them down?
thank you, ladies.
good morning, students.
I ask all of you to show a little sympathy for our junior class.
they are almost through with ivy week.
as is our long-standing tradition, the Constance billard girls will be in charge of Friday night's mixer, and the st. Jude's boys will provide the ushers for the visiting representatives.
for those of you who dream of attending an ivy league school, this mixer is the most important event of your life.
but no pressure.
Ah, it's not that bad.
it looks like I shaved with a wood chipper.
I was going with more of a chain saw.
not helping. - Not trying to.
Hey, look on the bright side-- you're not a hemophiliac.
otherwise, you'd-- you'd be in the emergency room.
and that's helping?
mm, not really.
dartmouth's gonna love you.
Yeah, I gotta believe being able to shave is a prerequisite for attending.
no one is better qualified, no one is smarter, more well-rounded...
or wounded?
it's not like I have a trust fund to fall back on, dad.
you know, all I have is what's up here.
well, that is the most important thing.
college is about academic excellence, not your stock portfolio.
besides, you're gonna do great in your interview.
you take after your dad that way.
spotlight doesn't phase us.
you better hope there's not a spotlight involved.
I'm your sister. It's what I do.
not when it's about dartmouth.
remember, students...
Nathaniel, a little wake an ke?
we have our interviews today.
my point exactly. I have my 1-hitter.
but underclassmen should consider this week a dress rehearsal.
you are not only representing yourselves this week, but generations from our school and your families.
try not to cut me off next time.
you almost knocked me over the side of the bench.
I didn't cut you off.
I didn't mean to.
you win fair and square, and nothing could make me prouder...till you get in the old alma mater, that is.
dad, we talked about this, about me keeping my options open, looking out west.
Yeah, of course, but let's get serious here.
someone with your grades wants to get into Dartmouth, you need to appear to be working for it.
d, - I... Ushering the rep is a good step.
how come every time I bring up going to U.S.C, you act like it's a joke?
Nate, there's a plan here.
maybe I want to make my own plan.
listen, your mother and I didn't work this hard so you can just make things up as you go along.
Dartmouth, law school, Blair.
soon you're gonna have everything.
listen, I'm late for work.
nail that interview today.
go, green!
as part of ivy week's festivities, at tomorrow night's mixer, Blair Waldorf will announce the charity her community outreach committee will honor this year.
have you seen Serena?
I wonder where she is.
and you know what I wonder?
how I'm supposed to hear anything about Yale with all this talk about Serena.
do you remember when dad gave me my first Yale sweatshirt?
I don't think any piece of clothing has ever fit me more perfectly, not to mention how adorable I found that bulldog.
remember when I asked you if I could get a bulldog?
good call, by the way, saying no.
and now the big day is finally here.
soon Nate and I will be away at college.
him coming down to Yale, me going up to Dartmouth.
dad flying in for the Princeton game.
I hope it doesn't make you feel old watching me grow up.
eat up, Miss Blair. Your mom would want you to have a good breakfast.
and now headmaster Prescott...
so Serena's really not here?
that's what I said.
when you weren't supposed to be talking.
thank you, Miss Tedrow.
Serena, come on. Hurry up. You're gonna be late.
I am! And I know.
you know, you shouldn't have stayed at your brother's again.
I mean, why sleep there?
it's not like he can even see you.
his eyes are closed.
do you have one maternal bone in your entire body?
Serena, you need your rest, okay?
it's ivy week.
I know, and if I can get out of this hotel room, it's my sole mission in life to impress that Brown rep.
well, I am so thrilled to hear you say that's still your plan, because, I mean, I know it's something we've always talked about, but honestly, since you've been back, I've, uh, wondered if your mind was even on college.
look, mom, I've had my mind on a lot of things.
but since recent events, going away to college sounds pretty good.
how, um, how did you leave things with Dan?
I don't want to talk about it.
what's going on with you and Blair?
mom, please! - It's o
look, all I wanna do is just finish high school in peace and go away to a state with lots of people who don't know who I am and just start over, okay?
take a cab. Don't walk.
Oh, god.
God, please don't tell me it's over.
what? You were there. I-I would say it's pretty over.
I meant the assembly.
Oh, right. No, yeah, no, it just ended now.
damn it.
anyway, good luck.
Yeah, you, too.
Oh, too bad you missed the assembly.
not that it matters.
brown doesn't offer degrees in slut.
spotted-- S.
not so fashionably late and dressed down by B.
game on, ladies.
look, I made a mistake with Nate, okay?
but then you sabotaged me with Dan.
we don't have to be friends, but
what's up, Waldorf?
sorry. It slipped.
I'm fine.
I really want to believe that was an accident.
then you must be delusional.
thank you.
running out of colors here, Blair.
and I'm running out of patience. Enough, okay?
it's enough when I say it's enough.
God!
girls, break it up!
get off of me!
is that enough yet?
so we've actually come to physical blows, huh?
truce?
my leg!
Serena, you're out of here.
Oh, my gosh.
I hope it's broken.
Hey, upper east siders.
we hear that world war Ⅲ just broke out, and it's wearing kneesocks.
choose your side or run and hide.
we have a feeling this one's to the death.
and why should you be the Dartmouth usher?
well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I think I can answer your question in three parts.
and I'd like to start with the third part first, if it's cool, unless, that would be confusing.
in which case, I can start at the beginning.
the Dartmouth"principles of community" highlight integrity, responsibility and consideration.
well, from st. Jude's, I've learned integrity.
from being an older brother, I have learned responsibility, and from my parents, who have sacrificed everythingto send me to this school, I've learned consideration.
it really comes down to one thing- Dartmouth is my dream, and I've never asked dartmouth, but...
I think it's been dreaming of me.
that--that was a joke, or an attempt at one.
next question.
you are the ideal Dartmouth candidate.
thank you, sir.
and it would be an honor to attend Dartmouth.
I've grown up hearing all about it from my father.
I'm just not sure it's my first choice, and if there's only one usher position available, I'm sure there's someone who wants it more than me.
why should I be chosen to be an usher?
I'm Chuck Bass.
excuse me.
Yale Chuck Bass - Hey. - Hey.
you get the one you wanted?
no. No, actually, you did...
which makes total sense because I'm second in our class, and you're somewhere around-- what, I don't know, uh, last?
no hard feelings, huh?
why should there be?
I mean, how many libraries has your dad had to endow to get you this spot?
you've earned it.
look, man, you don't know anything about my family.
I'm sorry. You're right. You're right.
I'm sure J. L.Hall will be very impressed with your passion for the Dartmouth experience.
who the hell is J. L.Hall?
he's the ivy rep.
you might want to pick up his book if you want anything to talk about.
the Petting Zoo-- that's the name of his book.
angry guy, huh?
short fuse. I'm trying to work on that.
well, let me know how that goes for you.
Yeah, I'll-- I'll keep you posted.
it's a tough week.
not for me, apparently.
Oh, you got an usher position?
no, I didn't.
uh, in an ironic though not totally unexpected twist, Nate got the one I wanted.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, I guess that's life when you're not a legacy.
well, hey, just 'causere not an usher doesn't mean you're not gonna get into an ivy.
yeah? Wh--uh, where'd your parents go to school?
harvard and Brown.
that's-- that's all I'm saying.
I can't believe Serena did this.
Yeah, such a cheap shot.
finally.
hello to you, too.
I heard about the field hockey throw down.
all those mouth guards and short skirts-- I hope somebody filmed it.
you're heinous.
which is probably why you called.
you know me well.
women like to pretend they're complicated. I know better.
my leg's numb now.
how about a heating pad?
sure. - Okay.
Serena came home for a reason.
one can only guess.
I'm done guessing. I want answers, and no one likes to be on the ground floor of a scandal like Chuck Bass.
I am a bitch when I wanna be.
opportunity to cause some trouble, uncover a secret?
take "yes" for an answer.
let's turn back to school.
I left something important behind.
Oh, Danny boy, how was your day?
he's about to hype dinner.
cause no matter how good it was, it's about to get a lot better.
I've outdone myself with the Bolognese.
sorry about the melodramatic entrance.
you didn't get it?
no, I didn't get it.
and that I do not get.
they...they gave it to Nate...
last year, uh, I believe he had an original thought.
it died of loneliness.
I'm sorry.
you're sorry?
Yeah, I know how much you and mom sacrificed.
the whole reason you send us to a school like this is so we can go to a college of our choice.
what if that's all for nothing?
it's not, okay? It's not.
so you don't get to be the usher of some whatever party.
dad, can I just, um, stew alone for a while?
we're Humphreys, dad. Not exactly royalty uptown.
are you okay with that?
no, but I'm used to it.
Ostroff treatment center
this is way too good.
mom, how's paris?
you're not going to believe where I found our little princess.
Really?
admit it. Even for me, this was good.
if you weren't such a perv, I'm sure the C.I.A. would hire you in a second.
defending my country--there's a future I never imagined.
with good reason.
what is she doing there?
well, what's anyone doing there?
it's a facility for the disturbed or addicted.
you must have your own wing.
you don't get nearly enough credit for your wit.
so the question is, what do you do now?
well, I was thinking... total social destruction.
and here I thought you were getting soft.
so this is your bed, huh?
leaving now.
you can repay me another time.
I've been in these sessions every day for the last week, but nothing is going to change unless she stops hiding him here and lets him have his life back.
this is not called hiding, Serena.
it's called recovery.
telling everyone he's staying with aunt Carol in Miami?
he's not ready.
he's not, or you're not?
okay, let's take a deep breath.
it's good to see honest conversation.
what does she know about honesty?
but I really think a decision like this includes Eric as well.
Oh, you mean I have a say in this?
Thanks.
Eric, of course. We're here for you.
look, if you're ready to leave, you tell us, okay? No matter what mom says.
I would really like to get out of here...
Oh, no.
but maybe I'm not ready yet.
Hey, what about for a few hours?
you can be my date to the ivy week party tonight.
Serena, that party is an important event for you.
well, he'll be around people he knows.
it'll be fun, comfortable.
uh, actually, that sounds great.
well, there we go.
compromise.
that wasn't so hard, was it?
you know what? I have to go, help them set up for tonight at the school.
it's my job as both parent committee chair and responsible mother.
it'll be great, okay?
Hi. How are you? - Good.
Rufus Humphrey.
uh, my kid, dan, goes to st. Jude's, and he really should have been selected as Dartmouth's usher.
maybe there was a mix-up, some kind of a glitch in the system?
I'd like to believe that because I like to believe the best in people.
I'm sorry, Mr. Humphrey. The usher positions have been filled.
there's nothing we can do.
uh, is there anything else? Any other positions?
uh, you'll have to discuss this with our committee chairwoman.
sure, perfect. I'd love to. Where can I find her?
I'm not sure. She must be running late. I... oh, there she is now.
why am I not surprised?
lucky for you, she seems to be in a good mood.
until she sees me.
Rufus. - Told ya.
excuse me.
you got a minute, Lily?
not for you.
you're in. - What?
the ivy week party tonight.
your name will be on the program and everything.
you got me the Dartmouth spot?
I knew you could do it, dad.
no, you didn't, and no, I didn't.
how do you feel about the refreshment committee?
well, there is--there isno refreshment committee.
not until now.
Oh, god.
what? Everybody gets thirsty. It's really a position of power.
how did you secure me this prominent and simultaneously embarrassing position?
by offering my own services.
serving snacks?
I'm the head of the entertainment committ.
another committee that didn't exist until you left the house today.
way to go, dad. Wait. So who's the entertainment?
uh, since it was such short notice, the only person I could get was myself.
kind of a staid affair for early '90s postpunk math rock, don't you think?
I'm bringing a couple of the guys.
it'll be Rufus unplugged.
need a roadie?
Thanks, sweetie.
should I call mom, and we can just make this a full-fledged Humphrey affair?
look, I did the best I could.
at least you get to officially be a part of this thing.
you can talk to that author you love, ask him anything you want.
like his, uh, preference for soft drinks?
if you get at all anxious, sweetie, if you feel light-headed or panicky
I'll be fine, mom. All I have to do is be normal. Or at least act normal.
works for mom.
do you see the Yale rep?
I thought you wanted to go to Brown, and Blair wanted to go to Yale.
Yeah, I know.
my father would never forgive me if I didn't introduce myself.
he says that you twoused to do crew together.
crew?
Oh, hi. I'm Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Blair, I didn't know you were interested in doing crew.
I'm not.
I was just saying that there's a family connection because of my father
in fact, I didn't know you were interested in athletics at all.
well, especially ones where you might get your hair wet.
she's really more of the indoors type of girl.
Oh, my goodness. Your glass is almost empty.
let's get you a drink.
uh, no, I'll take him.
Oh, don't worry about it.
so tell me about Yale.
can you please explain how Serena's commandeering the Yale rep while you're supposed to be his usher?
I switched.
I'm trying to get into Princeton.
Oh, don't your La Perlas in a bunch.
look who's arrived-- Dr. Ostroff.
Blair, Dr. Donald Ostroff.
interesting choice of guest, B.
such a pleasure. I've heards-such wonderful things...
coincidence? I think not.
I liked your book.
Oh, thanks.
what did you think of the epilogue?
some people really love it.
the New York Times called it a "cheap cop-out."
warner bros. is making a movie.
I think they're gonna change the end.
well, I can see how the ending might not seem all that... commercial.
would you like something to drink?
Lily, how are you?
Oh, Bart, hello. How are you?
Hey, Eric.
how's, uh, Miami?
it was good, thanks.
you know, go, Marlins.
would you excuse me, please?
so the neuroscience project I'm working on involves the cellularsignaling pathway of neuronalnitric oxide synthase.
it's initiated when glutamate binds to N.M.D.A.R...
Hi. You're Eric, right?
Yeah, you're Jenny, Dan's sister, right?
Yeah, we, um, met at... - Bendel's.
Yeah, I remember.
Oh, cool.
Eric, good to see you.
you enjoy Miami?
uh, yeah. S-save the manatees.
manatees?
it's a long story.
I've got time.
it's a little dark and...
I can handle it.
you wanna go to Yale then?
no, Brown. It's just this thing with Blair.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I get it.
I mean, since you don't have to actually worry about getting into college, why not make the entire evening about screwing over Blair?
no, thanks.
Hey.
wait, you're seriously not gonna talk to me?
like, literally not speak?
Hey.
Oh, much better.
Thanks, guys.
so, um, what's he like?
like a Dartmouth English lit professor I have nothing in common with.
guess I could tell him how everything I have got because I'm an Archibald.
you should mention Dr. Seuss.
Theodor Geisel is his real name. He went to Dartmouth.
hall said he got the idea for The Petting Zoo from the Lorax.
the what?
you know what? Never mind.
just-- just mention how his prose style is influenced by early faulkner. You'll be all right. Or not.
I was actually gonna get some fresh air.
how about you take these over to him?
all right.
Yeah, I guess I could leave my post unmanned for a minute or two.
where do you think you're going?
home.
I don't think so.
now you get back out there and you finish what you started.
you mean what you started?
I don't wanna go to Dartmouth.
there, I said it.
now back off.
so we moved into the hotel, and, uh...
it was just the two of us, and I was really lonely.
so... that's when you...
so I ended up at the Ostroff center.
and my mom says that they have the best counselors, but what they really get paid for is to to keep their mouths shut.
look, I- I won't say anything.
I promise.
so do you wanna go back in?
Yeah, and answer more questions about Florida?
well, I have a grandma who lives in fort Myers.
I can help think of some material.
may I please have everyone's attention?
welcome again to the constance billard/st. Jude's ivy week mixer.
I'm Blair Waldorf, chair of the community outreach committee.
every year, our schools choose to support one local institution that we feel benefits our community.
this year, our schools have chosen to honor the Ostroff center.
this semester, our choice is a very personal one because the center has helped one of our own.
what is going on here?
it's because of their excellent program which aids so many young addicts and alcoholics that a student here with us today is clean and sober.
at least, for now.
can I please have Serena Van Der Woodsen join me on stage?
spotted at ivy week mixer
s. And B.'S last stand, and only one gets out alive.
better take cover.
please tell me this isn't happening.
it's not.
no. No, you're not going up there.
you're gonna stay right here, okay?
whatever you're doing, think about who's standing in this room right now.
don't try to deny it. Chuck saw you.
Hi.
I'm Serena Van Der Woodsen.
I just wanna thank my friend, Blair Waldorf, for recognizing the Ostroff center and all of the good things that they do.
Thanks, Blair.
at the center, one of the main things that we learn is forgiveness.
she's in rehab?
no, it's not her. It's her brother who's there.
what?
you can't tell anyone, okay?
I won't, but why is she doing this?
I've learned about how, in order to move forward with our future, we must forgive those who have wronged us in the past, and we must, ourselves, ask for forgiveness from those whom we've wronged.
without this forgiveness, innocent people get hurt
all right, thank you, Serena.
thank you. Thank you.
honesty may be the best policy in some zip codes, but not in this one, and not this week, 'cause "I was a teenage drug addict" is not exactly a winning college essay.
and now can I please have Dr. Ostroff join me on stage?
why is Blair outing you for a drug problem that you don't have?
you don't, do you?
mom!
well, it's not like we have some free, open relationship.
and that's my fault?
look, what's happened to Eric has put a huge strainon our family, but we are still a family.
why do you think I did what I just did?
will you excuse me?
I'm gonna go end this with Blair now.
Blair, what the hell was that?
will you excuse us, please? - Sure.
so we good now?
are we square?
no, because nothing I do will ever be as bad as what you did to me.
look, I'm asking you, please.
I'll stop if you will.
you're just saying that because today you lost, and you're gonna keep losing.
now if you'll excuse me, unlike you, I have a future to get back to.
what?
what, do you want to congratulate me on destroying my future?
no, no, no, no, no, no.
to ask if you're okay, 'cause what you did in there for your brother, that was... that was very cool.
wait, how did you know about my brother?
it-- it's okay.
really, no one will ever hear it from me, but if you ever need anybody to talk to, or not talk to, I'd be happy to do either.
I'll keep that in mind.
and, um, I know I said some things about you and your world, and I' sorry. Obviously, I don't know anything about your life.
thank you, but I've really got to get out of here.
Yeah, sure, sure.
but...
maybe, you know, I can take you up on that getting together and not talking thing sometime?
will you call me?
Yeah.
okay, let's go. Let's get out of here.
no, there's someone I need to talk to first.
please, mom, I can do this.
okay.
Blair, can I talk to you? It'll just take a moment.
sure. Sure.
Serena's not a patient at the Ostroff center.
Eric, you've always been a sweetkid, and I can understand you trying to protect your sister
I am.
I've never even seen you take a drink.
I'm not an alcoholic. I did this. And today, Serena protected me.
Eric, I...I didn't...
see that coming? Yeah. Oh, it must be a shock for someone who thinks she knows everything.
and what was that all about?
another bomb lands in Blair's lap.
will she use it as ammunition, or will she finally surrender and put down her arms?
nothing.
to Dan: hope to see you in two years
so you really impressed the guy, huh? Must be the way you poured those sodas.
Yeah, about that, uh...
I know I may have been a little light on the gratitude...
Yeah, a touch.
but I appreciate even if I sometimes don't show it.
we're real men, son. We don't like to share our feelings.
but...
I know what you're capable of, and nothing-- my last name, my bank account-- is gonna keep you from getting what you deserve, not if I can help it.
and I see that Dartmouth has an electroacousticmusic program. What do you think of me applying?
what?
Yeah, and Jenny's smart. We'll get her early admission. Maybe we'll all go.
so not remotely funny.
huh?
Hello?
Oh, yeah, I'll be right there.
where the hell could you possibly have to be right now?
I'm late for a run with my dad.
who's Jessica?
Jersey girls.
let's just say they're the Princeton tigers for a reason.
all right, I'll see ya.
you feel this? Feeling good? - Good.
all right,'cause I'm gonna...
Hey, good to see you, son.
turns out Jed's a runner, too.
I would have never mentioned it if I knew he was gonna get me out here this early.
I'm glad to see you're feeling better, Nate.
I was, uh, just telling Jed about your little bout of food poisoning last night.
what do you say, kid don't you want to show him how it's done?
let's go.
Nate is the captain of his lacrosse team, as well as being an all-starcross-country runner.
Hi. - Hey!
um, is it okay that I'm here?
Yeah. Hi.
uh, will your mom be mad?
that you're here? That would require her stopping by. Saturday mornings are spent at bliss, and after last night, I think she could use some extra time on the massage table.
well, here. Somebody has an admirer.
they're for my sister... from the Brown rep. Apparently his cousin did some time here in his youth.
well, that's good, right?
I mean, at least her entire future isn't blown.
I don't think that's making her feel a whole lot better right now.
whenever something's bothering you, I can always find you here.
you here for another catfight? What's that?
a letter.
I wrote it to you when you were away at boarding school. I never sent it.
dear Serena, my world is falling apart, and you're the only one who would understand.
my father left my mother for a 31-year-old model...a male model.
I feel like screaming because I don't have anyone to talk to.
you're gone...
my dad's gone.
Nate's acting weird.
where are you?
why don't you call?
why did you leave without saying good-bye?
you're supposed to be my best friend.
I miss you so much.
love, Blair.
why didn't you send it?
I would've-- - you would've what?
you knew, Serena, and you didn't even call.
I didn't know what to say to you or even how to be your friend after what I did. I'm so sorry.
Eric told me what happened.
I guess your family's been going through a hard time, too.
spotted in central park-- two white flags waving.
could an upper east side peace accord be far off?
so what will it be-- truce or consequences?
we all know one nation can't have two queens.
what happens next? Only time will tell.
X. O.X. O. Gossip girl.
gossip girl here.
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan'elite.
I actually thought this time would be different.
but you're just the same girl you always were.
it's stupid for you to want her to be anything other than she is.
no, she just needs someone to believe in her.
Dan was denied financial aid at yale.
I mean, I could help you out.
I think this is something I have to handle on my own.
I'm Gabriel. - Gabriel and Poppy were over.
and it's not like either one of us planned this.
this--this thing between us just happened, and we couldn't stop it.
would you like to join us?
I'd love to meet the people in Serena's life.
eventually, every queen finds herself in unfamiliar territory outside the castle walls.
in Blair Waldorf's case-- the village.
N. Y.U?
what was I thinking?
you know how I feel about ironic facial hair.
well, you were thinking,"a," you're lucky to get into a school at all, and "b," you're super lucky 'cause where you got in happens to be in the same city as your fantastic boyfriend.
that's true.
I've been coming down here for years, and I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know
the best latte, the best slice, the best pot dealer.
but first, the most important lesson of all-- how to ride the subway.
Nate, you're sweet...
but obviously, you've inhaled too much patchouli.
there's no way I'm going down there.
it's full of mole men and middle-class professionals.
well, you have to learn.
how else are you gonna visit me at Columb?
why do you think god gave us car service?
our schools are at opposite poles of Manhattan.
I mean, in traffic, it could take hours.
the subway's definitely the quickest way.
please don't ask this of me.
anything you want, dan.
you're graduating high school-- that's a big deal.
how about a trunk?
trunks are great for storage.
Books--you're gonna have a lot of books at college.
Hey, jenny, maybe you need a trunk, too.
any one you want.
dad, what's with this newfound interest in antiquing?
Oh, I'm just stimulating the economy by rewarding my fantastic kids, and it so happens that the, uh, gallery was a great investment.
it's listing for three times what I paid for.
you didn't get soaked when the real estate bubble burst?
well, it's not as much as I would've gotten at the top of the market, but I'll be able to send you both to school and have a little breathing room to figure out what I want to do next.
consider cooking classes?
I mean, even I'm getting tired of your waffles, dad.
not cool. I sometimes make chili.
it looks a little delicate for your hand.
don't get any ideas, big shot.
I'm just looking.
it's lily. One sec.
check out what dad was looking at.
rats go underground.
not waldorfs.
well, you can always borrow chuck's helicopter.
kidding. Chuck...
what a waste of time that was.
you know, it's not a real relationship if you can't hold hands.
Oh, but Nate is good to me.
good for me.
and he's learned a thing or two.
so being a kept man does have its perks.
Yeah, but no man is worth suffering the indignity of mass transit.
how's the foreigner?
Blair Gabriel is from North Carolina.
that's in the United States.
not by choice.
let me remind you of a little thing called the Civil War.
everything with Gabriel is perfect.
no strings, no demands...
except he is so focused on building his new company that he can never commit to anything-- dinner reservations, movies.
sometimes, he'll get a text for a meeting, and then, poof, he's gone.
well, if it's casual like you say, no strings...
then what do you expect? It's not like you're gonna marry the guy.
I kind of did marry him.
we got carried away.
I talked to Cyrus.
he said it doesn't count.
let me get this straight.
he goads you into making the ultimate commitment, and now he can't stick it out through a whole dinner?
he didn't go me.
it was...romantic.
Gabriel is disappearing for a reason.
we need to get to the bottom of it.
no, we don't.
Oh, come on! Let's follow him tonight.
we can dress up, use code names.
Dorota is a great help with surveillance equipment.
doesn't that sound at all fun?
no, not even a smidgen.
so what exactly are you guys doing tonight?
no.
well, you suck more than usual today.
a little distracted.
things with
it's okay. You can say her name.
I feel weird talking about her with you.
Nathaniel, she's your girlfriend.
if we want to be friends like we were, it's just part of the deal.
so it's okay to just talk about her guy-to-guy like we used to?
well, I was there for you last week, wasn't it?
Yeah, you were.
I think next year's gonna be harder than I thought, you know?
with me in morningside heights and her all the way down in the village, it's basically like we're in a long-distance relationship.
well, it's too bad you don't have a place in the middle like my room at the Palace.
say the word, she can crash with me.
that's not funny.
you're right. I'm sorry.
but, archibald, let's face it-- you won.
I lost.
you have nothing to worry about with me.
I'm out of that game.
well, I certainly don't have to worry about your weak-ass jumper, do I?
and then my grandfather says, if it's menthol you want, it's menthol you're gonna get.
I didn't know your family was in the tobacco industry.
Yeah, they are, but Gabriel doesn't want anything to do with it.
they were grooming me to take over, but I had to break out on my own and do something positive.
so I started researching new technologies and found a company that wants to provide wireless access to the developing world, so I've been backing them.
I mean, it sounds like such a good thing, but to my family, it is betrayal.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
family is so important.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, I asked the caterer for a 99 brunello.
this isn't a pta meeting.
though nothing's as important as the right wine.
look, I apologize.
I'm hosting the co-op meeting tomorrow, and it'll be an hour-long battle over lobby renovations, followed by cocktails and appetizers.
you're welcome to join us.
keep Serena company.
Oh, yes, please do.
I'd be honored.
Hey, who's up for a movie? - Yes.
do you know what? That sounds lovely, but...
I'm sorry, honey. I have some work to do.
so...this has been great, thank you very much.
but I'm afraid I have to go.
Gabriel, it's a movie.
you know, most of them are only, like, 80 minutes these days.
and you know that there's nothing else I'd rather do, but I'm a little behind on reviewing the prospectus.
this is important to me.
Yeah, and you spending time with my family is important to me.
my deal will be closed soon, and then I'm all yours, I promise.
I'll see you tomorrow.
let me get my coat.
I see you're wearing your beret.
who are we spying on tonight?
Serena's shady southerner.
well, I can't say he does much for me, either.
but why the intrigue?
don't tell me-- not enough drama in domestic bliss with Nate?
you know, when people step outside their relationship for a thrill, it's usually not alone and in the dark.
I happen to be worried about my best friend.
Serena said Gabriel just disappears.
poof!
well, I'm gonna find out where he's poofing to.
and besides, it's good for couples to have different interests.
this feels eerily familiar.
shut up! Look.
and when a queen discovers her best maiden is with a dragon in disguise...
the only thing to do is pull up the drawbridge and trap him...
metaphorically, of course.
you have to dump him!
we caught that redneck red-handed.
well, B.Obviously I'm not thrilled, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this on my own.
now why can't you worry about your own relationship ?
what does that supposed to mean?
it was friday night, and you were out spying on my boyfriend, instead of seeing a movie or something.
why can't anybody see a movie around here?
I have to call you later.
Serena, there's something you shou know.
last night I was...
spying on that boyfriend of Serena's. Philanderer!
Really？
Chuck and I saw him with Poppy.
wait. Chuck?
you were with Chuck?
Yeah, we ran into each other outside the building.
it's not a big deal. You know that, right?
of course. It's no big deal.
good, because unlike some people we know...
we have a relationship without secrets or lying.
Yeah, I know.
we're really lucky.
good.
ready to go have lunch?
sure.
are you sleeping with her?
no. No.
not since I met you.
I told her that I just needed space and time to think.
but the truth, I'd--I'd just like to never see her again.
you know, when I first came to New York, I didn't know many people.
and all the investors in my company are her contacts.
and when she found out about us, she threatened to pull them.
so I told her that you and I were over.
if she found out the truth...
I could lose-- I could lose everything.
do you hate me?
no, I don't hate you.
but I hate lying.
and you lied to me.
and you lied to Poppy and...
well, despite everything, she's still my friend, and I care about her.
I didn't plan on falling in love with you.
Gabriel, you--you have to tell her about us.
I can't.
you know how jealous she is.
and I've spent two years developing this company.
it's--it's everything to me.
it's finally that chance to be free from my parents.
by tying yourself to Poppy?
I've done the 2-girlfriend thing.
I can't do that again.
listen, these contracts will be done in one week.
and after that, I promise you I will tell her everything.
trust me. The money she'll make, it'll cushion the blow.
as long as it's not physical, then I...
I guess I can live with it.
but only for a week. I mean it.
believe me, I only have eyes for one girl.
and she is the most exquisite thing I've ever seen.
so am I not supposed to mention the outfit?
I'm a cater waiter now.
where you been?
Just...working.
well, I was hoping to never speak about this, but it might actually feel good to.
Oh, hey, there you guys are.
so have you told her about the ring yet?
ring? What ring?
we caught our dad eyeing one yesterday.
a ring ring?
Oh, my god. Wait.
this is good news, right?
well, I mean, he--he looked.
he didn't buy.
he chickened out. Why? - Why?
maybe because Jenny basically told him she'd never move in with the V. D.-Dubs.
okay, or he's worried about Dan having slept with his maybe stepsister.
well, I hope that's not it, 'cause there's really zero chance of Serena and I ever getting back together.
so you guys are okay with it.
Yeah, well, it'd be weird-- dad marrying Lily.
sharing bunk beds with Chuck.
Yeah, I mean, it would definitely be weird.
but, I don't know, you should've seen dad yesterday.
I mean, he was practically skipping.
I don't think I've ever seen him this happy.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone that happy.
then you should tell him you support him.
no, that's not-- that can't be right.
that's not what we dis-discussed. That's, uh...
dad?
uh, no. No, no, no.
Though...maybe not today.
let me get this straight.
Gabriel is still popping Poppy, and you're okay with that?
no, no, this is too M. O.B. Go put on the vena cava.
for the hundredth time, he's not still sleeping with her.
and while it's not ideal, he is gonna break up with her next week.
and what proof did he offer of that?
he doesn't need proof, B.
because I trust him.
we have this amazing connection.
do you know he said he fell in love with me the first time he ever saw me?
Oh, that is interesting, considering the fact that he was on vacation with his girlfriend.
actually, the first time he saw me was a year ago when I was out with Georgina.
he busted me on my fake southern accent.
and what night was that?
don't tell me it was that night
that night that you blacked out and don't remember anything?
he fell in love with you while you were roofied.
how romantic.
no, no, no. It wasn't like that.
he said I was completely lucid.
it must've been before Georgina drugged me.
I just don't happen to remember it.
believe me, I had to learn the hard way.
trust is the most important thing in a relationship.
and we have that.
the way I trust Nate and he trusts me?
even though he may as well be going to school in Guam next year,
I wouldn't worry if I can't find him because I know he'll always be true to me.
I hope so, B.
because, no offense, but we both know that that hasn't always been the case.
what are you saying-- that Nate is in love with you?
what are you saying-- that Gabriel isn't?
no.
I'm just saying he's not gonna break up with Poppy.
why would he?
he's having her cake and eating yours, too.
okay, right. So--so both Nate and Chuck are obsessed with you, but my boyfriend can't stay faithful to me for seven days?
no, that's
I love you.
I just don't want to see youet hurt, okay?
go put that back on.
it was beautiful on you.
Bye.
I-I thought you left with Dan and Jenny.
I was just about to close up.
you--you can go home now.
I'll savor my moments here while I can.
gonna miss this place.
Yeah, well, it, uh, looks like your job will be safe for quite a while.
what do you mean?
the real estate agent hasn't received one call about the place.
she thinks it might be months before we find a buyer.
it's the market.
that's why you were so upset earlier.
is there a plan "b"?
Yeah, last year, after the tour, a music publishing company offered to buy the lincoln hawk catalog.
you're gonna sell your life's work?
Yes.
and, apparently, now that we're not touring, it isn't even worth what it was last year.
you know, I stopped touring to spend time with my family.
it turns out it might've been the worst thing I could've done for them.
I'm sorry. This isn't your burden.
Hey, let's get outta here.
Archibald, what are we doing here?
this place is great, but Murray Hill?
even your mother's too hip for this zip code.
it's for me.
it's halfway between N. Y.U. and Columbia.
I just figur I'd lease this so I could be close to Blair next year.
well, congratulations, but couldn't you have told me this over the phone?
you're my friend, all right?
I brought you here as my friend to show you I found a solution to my problem.
okay, friend, I hope you'll be very happy here.
I just wanted to show you that Blair and I are really serious now.
you understand that, right?
she told you about our little run-in last night.
you told me you'd back off.
I did and will continue to do so.
last night was nothing.
we ran into each other on the street.
it was no big deal.
with you two, it's always a big deal.
we just have to be clear with each other.
I want you to know that Blair and I are in a good place.
what place is that-- some tacky apartment where you can keep your eye on her?
no, that's not the reason I got
if you needed to mark your territory so badly, Nathaniel, maybe you should just pee on her.
I don't want you to go near her again.
I mean that.
Oh, look...it's Blair.
I think I'll take this one outside.
Hello?
I thought if I proved the north caro-liar was cheating with his ex, that would be it, but she fell for his business meeting excuse-- monkey business, more likely.
with Serena and Poppy both fighting over the banana.
I'm really worried, Chuck.
you know how Serena is. She gets in over her head.
we need to expose this two-timer for what he is.
so what do you say, Bass?
one last mission?
by any chance, do you have Poppy Lifton's phone number?
queen of hearts or queen of heartache?
careful, B.
cut off the head of one love triangle, one of your own might grow back in its place.
and that concludes our co-op business at this time.
of my house?
I've been re before.
first, we'll start with Serena's room.
while I appreciate you playing the peacemaker, Chuck,
I'm not sure Serena will want to see me.
trust me, this should be exciting for everyone.
and this is Serena's dresser where she keeps all of her pajamas and peignoirs.
but maybe you've already been in there.
Blair, what are you doing?
nice. I knew it.
poppy, I know.
we--we need to talk.
what do you want to talk about?
the fact that you stole my boyfriend?
I didn't steal him. You left.
you know what? Don't.
cause it's not even you that I'm mad at.
it's him.
you are a lying, cheating-- I am gonna kill you!
no one's killing anyone.
it's a co-op cocktail party.
what an idiot I am!
using my connections for your company?
poppy, it is not like that.
you know it's not.
then leave with me.
right now.
and if you don't, I will call every investor and tell them to take their money back.
poppy, you and I are done.
things havent been good with us for a long time.
and I'm sorry.
Serena didn't steal me.
she swept me away.
you tell your investors whatever you want.
fine.
I'll tell them the truth.
that you're ruined.
good-bye, Gabriel.
I'm sorry. I just...
need a minute to clear my head.
well, I guess he really likes you.
at least now we know.
I'll deal with you later.
hello.
since when did my apartment become your watering hole of choice?
Rufus and Jenny let me in on their way out.
I thought I'd wait for you, maybe play a little I never.
I-I kind of already started.
Yeah, I can see that.
I'll go first.
all right.
I never slept with Chuck bass.
that's why I've been avoiding you.
I know. Its repulsive.
it is...
completely repulsive, but you didn't.
but you--you--you--you've been going through a lot lately.
I mean, the whole blair-nate reunion and all and
plus the whole "looking up while looking down" thing really had a certain appeal to it.
so you--you get no judgment from me.
everyone makes a mistake at least once.
I never...
nearly slept with georgina sparks.
I never slept with chuck bass twice.
Dan, you're lucky.
however bad your life sucks right now, you didn't need an std panel this week.
Yeah, there's that.
wait, why does my life suck right now?
so you going to Lily's now?
Yeah, the co-op meeting should be done by now.
there's a party after. You should come.
no offense. That sounds really boring, especially with Eric being out of town.
so, uh...
you kinda haven't been yourself tonight.
all day, actually.
I mean, is everything all right?
I'm just a little tired, but I'm fine.
you're not.
and I know why.
Jenny, whatever you think you know...
I know that you want to propose to Lily.
and I want you to know that Dan and I are totally okay with it.
but you have to let me make the bridesmaid dresses, okay?
I think those bridesmaid dresses are a bit premature.
Why? Dan saw you looking at that ring yesterday.
it's not a good time.
there are some, uh, complicated things happening right now.
well, whatever they are, you can fix them.
you just have to want it bad enough.
dad, my whole life, you said that I could do anything if I was willing to risk falling flat on my face.
so why does'nt that same advice apply to you?
right? - Good point.
and you know I'm right.
so I'm really glad you chose me over money.
I never really had a choice.
I'm just glad everything's in the open.
I'll go back to North Carolina and work with my father.
maybe hell let me design a public service campaign.
I'm sorry.
I know how hard you've been working.
well, you shouldn't be.
I 100% brought this on myself.
I could have really made a difference with this company.
and I have to admit, I wanted to rub that money in my father's face.
it was that good of a deal, huh?
poppy's investors would have tripled their money by the end of summer.
well, then you have to still do it.
come on. Without you, how else will all of the african teenagers send in posts to "gossip girl"?
poppy was serious about calling off her investors.
well, then find new ones.
look around.
these are residents of one of the wealthiest co-ops in Manhattan, and the smartest.
our board rejected Bernie Madoff five years in a row.
I thought we found out today was a mistake-- mixing business and pleasure.
please.
I would be so proud to help you.
Really? You sure?
Yes, of course. Let me go find my mom.
the Martinis are great, right?
so I heard you, uh, first met Serena on one of her infamous nights with Georgina.
you know, I've always wanted to know what happened.
it must be quite the story.
Oh, Nate, what are you doing here?
I thought there was a meets game.
I saw Dorota wearing her hat.
Yeah, I can just catch the highlights on sportscenter.
I wanted to surprise you.
are Chuck and Serena here?
somewhere.
I can't believe I let him talk me into operation: Gone with the weasel.
it's a long story and unimportant.
what matters is how glad I am you surprised me.
good. I'm not done.
I know you're nervous about us being far apart next year, so I got something.
it's a 1-bedroom in Murray Hill.
Oh, my god.
will you move in with me?
Yes.
Yes, of course I will.
you're moving in?
Yes, he is.
I'm taking her there now, actually.
well, before you birds fly off to your love nest, there's something you should know.
Gabriel says he met Serena the night before the S. A.T. S.
he said they were at butter.
no, that's impossible.
I know.
we should go tell Serena.
no, no, no.
Chuck can handle this by himself.
why don't we go see our apartment?
sometimes a queen has to make a choice.
a castle with a white knight or a quest with a dark prince.
so, B.
what'll it be-- netflix night with Nate or battling a beast with Bass?
the governments, the I. S.P. S and the big companies need to use these satellites.
we could be the only game in town.
and it has a charitable component, too.
free wireless access for all local schools and community groups.
well, this is just the sort of thing that some of us at Bass have been pushing for.
doing well by doing good.
Yes. But the only thing is there's a ticking clock.
some of the major internet corporations are pushing to do a similar thing.
if we act now, we block them completely and we make at least triple our investment.
well, Gabriel, why don't you send a prospectus to my assistant?
of course I have to look at it, but, um, you can tell your backers I'm in.
you were great!
now all you have to do is tell the rest of the co-op members that she invested, and with my mom's approval, you are golden.
I need to see you in your room.
another tour?
he's lying to you.
seriously, you two, enough.
he told chuck that he met you at butter, but I know for a fact that butter was closed that night because I used their bartender for the Nelly Yuki S.A.T. Sabotage party.
not that I need to explain this to either of you, but I was with Georgina that night, and she knows the manager, so it was probably a private party, or he just misremembered.
well, Chuck also saw him making a secretive phone call.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the smoking gun,a secretive phone call.
Blair, I support you in all of your crazy choices, case in point.
why can't you show me the same respect?
Gabriel is a good guy.
he's trustworthy.
even my mom trusts him, or she wouldn't have invested in his project just now.
just face it, you two.
you're using thias an excuse to get together again.
I'm going back to my boyfriend now.
if you know what's good for you, you'll go back to yours.
butter? Really?
it does sound kinda stupid when you say it out loud.
there's only one person who knows what really happened that night Gabriel supposedly met Serena.
I'm not going to Yale.
I'm so sorry I let it out like that.
but maybe this way it'll be a little easier on Rufus.
having to tell you would have killed him.
Yeah, I know.
you don't blame him, do you?
I-I blame the financial aid office and...
the recession and...
a certain imbecile former president.
my dad has gotta be the only person in the world who's more upset about this news than me.
he was so excited about...
selling the gallery and moving on.
do you think he'll still propose?
he's got a lot of pride.
I'll write you a check right now.
I look forward to working with you, gabriel.
Absolutely.
Gabriel, can I speak to you for a moment?
Yeah, of course.
excuse me.
I'd like to invest as well.
and as much as I appreciate your support, there are other investments better suited for someone in your situation
municipal bonds, mutual funds.
I'd be happy to show you how to set something
I know how to open a mutual fund.
I don't appreciate being patronized.
well, no, that wasn't my intention.
I apologize.
my money is just as good as anyone else's.
it's how the game works, isn't it?
opportunity arises in the private rooms of restaurants and on exclusive golf courses, and the rich get richer and the guys in the middle are never there.
well, I'm right here.
I want in.
I need to see the apartment tomorrow.
there's something I have to do now.
with Chuck?
Serena didn't believe us.
you mean she didn't just dump her boyfriend 'cause you two told her to?
what's wrong with her?
come with us.
no, I'm not going. Neither should you.
I mean, it's just Chuck playing games.
I don't think it is, and if you don't want to come with us, then please, just let me go.
I need you to trust me.
the limo's waiting.
you're right.
I need to trust you, and I do, so...
go.
you should call Eleanor.
we won't beack tonight.
wait. What? I thought she was back home in Connecticut.
you thought wrong.
Yes. Hello.
what time are your visiting hours?
we're coming to see Georgina Sparks.
get out your brooms, kids.
we're off to see the wicked witch of the east side.
Mr. Bass?
visiting hours have started.
I can't believe I have to see my sworn enemy with nancy pelosi hair.
now that you mention it, maybe it's best if I go in alone.
what?
you just said it.
you're enemies.
why would she help you?
because I'm gonna threaten to send her back to boot camp if she doesn't.
Blair, georgina and I go way back.
we have a special bond.
I'll handle this one.
you didn't even need me here.
you just wanted to get me alone, away from Nate, away from our first night in our apartment.
and his motives were pure, of course.
I'm sure it's a simple coincidence that he asked you to move in right when you and I began speaking again.
he asked me so I wouldn't have to take the subway next year.
that's maybe why he got the lease on the place.
but asking you to move in was for my benefit.
ask him yourself.
or you could just trust him.
still, the fact remains-- you chose to spend a night in a car with me over a night in your honeymoon suite with nate.
but then again, we all know your weakness for limos.
I came here for my best friend.
is that the only reason?
what is this place?
welcome.
are you a wayward soul in sense of direction?
I think I'm in the wrong place.
have you been saved, too?
Blair was so wrong about you. - What do you mean?
I didn't want to make you feel bad, but she and Chuck have this weird vendetta against you
some nonsense about butter being closed that night.
that's ridiculous.
if she would have heard "Savannah's" terrible southern accent that night...
she'd have a vendetta against you instead of me.
so--so what'd you think of Georgina anyway?
she didn't make that much of an impression.
not even her hair?
that flaming red? I mean...
I swear her colorist is masochistic.
I mean, of course I remember that.
but who cares?
if you'd met you that night, you'd forget everything else, too.
I should, uh, I should go home before my mom wakes up.
it's a 7-day session all about forgiveness, and at the end of it, we put on a passion play.
you're more than welcome to come with me.
I have to supervise the kids making papier- apostles for the set.
it's, um, brilliant.
Oh, it's not that hard.
it's just some flour and paste.
getting these Jesus freaks to believe you're one of them so you don't have to go back to boot camp?
still the same old Chuck.
why can't you believe that people can change?
Oh, people can change, but you?
you're wrong, Chuck.
you know, as--as bad as boot camp was, it really gave me time to think about the person I'd become
scheming, manipulative.
it sickened me.
so one day I decided to do something about it.
I went to church, found Jesus and I told him all my sins.
well, I bet that was a long talk.
he forgave me.
look, I know it seems crazy, but for the first time in my life,
I'm--I'm happy.
but if I know Chuck Bass, you're not here to be reformed.
I came to ask if you know a man named Gabriel Edwards.
I don't think so. Why?
he claims he met you at butter that night you roofied serena.
Yeah, I've been praying overtime for that one.
but...
that's impossible.
we never went to butter.
we were back in my hotel by midnight, watching "the hills" as Serena drooled on my shoulder.
did you forget something?
Yes!
to thank you for your amazing performance last night.
I think we're a good team.
you and Blair were right about Gabriel.
he's lying about meeting me that night.
I-I don't know why.
Yeah, I know.
look, hang tight.
Blair and I will be there as soon as we can.
Actually...since my limo's gone, that might be a while.
and eventually a queen realizes that a dark prince only has one thing on his mind, and it isn't slaying dragons.
so she takes her pumpkin carriage and goes back to the castle.
with all these investments from the party, we should have everything we need by the end of the month.
you know, I thought we were screwed when Chuck bass called me, but you found a way to make it work, and when you chose being poor and being with Serena...
she left me a message.
She'awfully needy, isn't she?
Hey, Gabriel. It's me.
listen I'm coming back to your hotel. We have to talk.
don't go anywhere.
I'll see you soon.
she sounds nervous.
Yeah, she does.
well, why would she be?
did something happen?
no, it's more like something that didn't happen
you doing your research properly.
she told me this morning that butter was closed the night that I allegedly met her there.
and what the hell is butter?
we gotta get out of here, fast.
just don't answer it.
okay, it's--it's fine. I can handle this.
I, uh, just wanted to bring you my check in person.
I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have gone with Chuck.
Oh, it's okay.
I'm just glad you came back.
well, come in. Let me show you around.
you know...
I loathe Murray Hill.
why did you get this apartment?
I got it so we wouldn't be so far apart next year.
and is that also why you asked me to move in with you?
knowing you and Chuck were hanging out made me jealous.
you said that you trusted me, but you really don't, do you?
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
so take your coat off and stay. Please.
it's Serena.
say hi for me.
I have so much love in my heart for that girl.
did you find him?
no, I'm too late.
what do you mean, you're too late?
I mean the drawers and closets are empty.
he's gone.
what do you mean, gone?
I have to call you back.
he can't be gone.
I need to talk to him.
I gave him half a million dollars.
Hey, dan.
Oh, coffee. Thank you, dad.
you know, uh, if you're here to deliver the bad news, it's okay.
I already know about Yale.
actually, that's, uh
I don't know I was--was so set on going there anyway.
I mean, it's basically a big version of ST. Jude's.
we all know how well I fit in there. - Well, dan
I got accepted into a lot of other great schools, a couple--a couple of great schools.
N. Y.U.--They offer financial aid.
I can always live at home.
or at our new home.
New--new home?
Yeah, we, uh, we got you a little something.
we pooled our savings.
fortunately, your tastes are very modest.
this is an amazing gesture.
well, we want you to be happy, dad.
and whatever you and Lily means for us, I mean, you know, we'll--we'll figure it out.
you kids are an inspiration.
but I insist on, uh, writing you a check, bcause there are certain things a man has to do on his own.
Oh, thank god.
Yeah, we were hoping that you would say that.
the reason I came here was not to deliver bad news but good, and if things work out the way I hope they will, Yale will be happening and a lot of other good stuff for this family.
what happened to your limo?
Arthur won't answer his phone, but I'm guessing Blair took it.
you came here with Blair?
you know what?
it's tually my day off, and I really miss the city.
Oh, dear queen, heed the words of a king
look like an angel, talk like an angel, but the devil in disguise.
X. O.X. O.Gossip Girl.
odes records. Rhodes' office.
Hi. Is he in?
it's Lily.
who?
his daughter?
Oh. Ahem. One moment, please.
thank you. Thank you very much.
Hey, Lil. Long time, babe.
Hi, dad. I know, um, which is why I was hoping that we could, like, catch up or something.
there's so much to talk about.
is there any way that you can, uh, have lunch?
you're in l. A? Why aren't you in Santa Barbara?
in school?
well, we can make it a dinner if that's better for you.
I'm leaving for London. But, Lil, what's going on?
Geoffrey's? Your regular table?
great okay, see you then. Love you.
Mrs. Bass?
we're here.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Serena's been in jail for over four hours.
she's already served more time than Ncole Richie and Lindsay Lohan combined.
she's a socialite mistakenly accused of stealing a bracelet.
I doubt they're working her over with the phone book.
when I called Lily, she said she was on her way.
where is she?
I just can't believe she had her own daughter arrested.
I mean, who does that?
someone who's never been arrested.
hello. I'm Lilian Bass.
I'm here for my daughter, Serena Van Der Woodsen.
so was Lily blown away?
well, not really.
Yeah, he never actually, uh...
proposed. Minor detail in a proposal.
kinda the key ingredient to the recipe.
so he came home and went into his room.
we haven't seen him since.
Hey, dad.
Oh, so prom tomorrow night.
what do you sa we stay in, watch some scary movies?
the scarier the better.
Absolutely.
you guys are the "gossip girl" generation.
don't expect me to believe you're not interested in this gossip.
Nope.Only interested in my nim chow.
so to add to the Lily intrigue-- Or possibly help explain it.
I got a weird call about your investment.
the money's gone. It's over.
Really? Cause, uh, Serena had a plan to get it all back. It's.
no, Lily had a plan of her own.
well, that's what I was hoping.
Yeah, she had Serena arrested.
what? - W-Y?
I suggest you kids stay out of it.
let these Van Der Woodsen women fight it out themselves.
you forced me to do this. I just hope you learned your lesson.
that my mom's crazier than I ever imagined?
well, no crazier than you, my daughter, thinking you could fix this situation yourself.
I was fixing this, but then you were too worried what people would think.
when you're a mother, you will understand that you have to make decisions that don't always win you points for popularity.
when I'm a mother, I will be nothing like you.
Yes, you say that now, but just wait.
I would rather give my kids up for adoption than end up like you.
Oh, wait. You did that.
I came down here to drop the charges and put this behind us.
please show a little respect, and I will stick with my plan.
I'll just stick to mine.
if you didn't notice, you weren't my phone call.
Oh, so who was?
she called me, darling.
ironic, isn't it?
if only she knew.
Hey, grandma.
for those who complain about the youth of today,
if you think we're bad, you should've seen our parents.
I don't care how much Ahmet wants to give him.
the guy can't sing.
I'll pay for his publishing. Good-Bye.
Hey, beautiful. You get lost
I'm sorry I'm late. I couldn't find parking.
that's what the valet's for.
right, but it also costs $2, and I just spent that on gas.
here to hit dad up for some cash?
what?
no.
so, um, christmawas weird without you.
somebody's gotta keep Tower records in business.
but I was sorry I couldn't be there.
yeah... um, about that...I'm not a headshrinker or anything, but I do think the sudden uprooting of my family from New York,
coupled with my parents' tumultuous divorce may have contributed to some recent difficulties that I might be having.
you got kicked out of boarding school.
what? Wait, wait. How did you know that?
she told me. - Mom.
Hello, Lily. What are you doing here?
if it was up to your father, they'd stop me at the county line,
but Santa Barbara's really only a prison in my mind.
good to see you, Cece.
wish I could say the same, Richard.
you hung up the phone with me, and you called her?
you didn't even give me a chance to explain.
that's because he would have to parent, and we know he always leaves "bad cop" to me.
punishing loved ones just comes so much more naturally to some people.
excuse me. May I have a gin and tonic?
no tonic.
I come with some good news.
you're letting me live with dad? No way.
that's exactly what I was gonna say.
my bags are in the car and can I have the room that overlooks the tennis courts?
I love that room.
thank you for coming all the way down here, mom, but I think this is all worked out, right?
Lily, that sounds so good. It's just
actually, your father did make a call to the school.
I told them what had been happening at home,
about your sister taking off, your mother and I splitting up.
I explained that it was An isolated, uncharacteristic act of rebellion.
they're willing to turn your expulsion into a suspension.
what? - You can be back on monday.
but I wanted to get expelled.
Lily, whatever for? That school has everything.
everything except for dad.
you're living this amazing new life here.
and I'm just scared that by the time I graduate,
I won't be a part of it anymore.
and what if you forget about me?
Lil, you do not have to ever worry about that.
I just have a lot going on right now with work.
I can't give you the time, the--The supervision that you need.
just like clockwork.
okay.
dad.
I'm late. I've gotta pack, get to the airport.
put lunch on my account. I'll talk to you soon.
dad, no.
why do you always have to do that?
dad.
thank you.
please don't walk away.
you need to be with your mother, Lil,
out of the city, in school.
we can't let you turn out like your sister.
Carol? Yeah, I think we can all agree on that front.
she ran away from our family, and for what?
to become an actress, which is a completely unrealistic goal.
I mean, yeah, she was pretty good as Abigail in "the crucible,
but what was that, like, 11th grade?
anyway, the point is-- Is I'm not carol.
I don't crave adventure or the freedom to walk my own path.
I'm perfectly comfortable with the path that you guys have laid out for me.
go home, Lil.
dad, you have a giant house. I won't be any trouble.
I'll call you when I get back from London.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
Lily, it's over.
let's go home.
I'll follow you back.
see you at home.
Eric and I had the most invigorating walk from the hotel.
you know, grandma is deceptively quick.
Oh, she's probably racing back to that bottle of gin she has hidden under the sink in the bathroom.
zing.
good morning to you as well.
what are you doing here, mother?
I don't remember inviting you as our guest. I know I haven't called you, and I'm positive you haven't so much as received a christmas card
or fruitcake at the holiday.
well, you can be thankful for the last one.
what have I ne to earn your ire, my dear?
well, let me think for a second. Maybe telling Rufus about our child?
I'm sorry if I thought it appropriate
that Rufus learns he has a son.
uh, you mean "had.
he died.
no, I had no idea.
imagine, something you don't know.
now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take Serena breakfast in bed so I can start the healing with my daughter.
uh, you might want to put a hold on the healing.
Serena's not in her room.
what? I thought she was coming home with you. Where is she?
why are you still in jail?
it's my choice.
Oh, god. You're not gonna come out of there with a mullet and a girlfriend, are you?
my mother didn't think that I was old enough to make my own decisions, so I decided to stay in jail, and I'm not leaving until she agrees to let me live my own life.
so it's a war of attrition.
so to speak.
except she gets to wage the war from the comfort Of her penthouse while you remain behind bars.
look, don't worry about me. Enjoy prom with Nate,
like you always planned In that scrapbook that you kept under your bed.
please. I don't remember that.
I was a child then.
I should go. I don't want to abuse my phone privileges.
the fact that you're on an actual pay phone Has me beyond nauseo.
stay strong, s.
what's this for?
strength. You will need.
I have good news and bad news. Which do you want?
good news first, always.
there is replacement.
what are you talking about?
it makes more sense if you pick bad news first.
your dress for prom.
the dry cleaners-- They ruined it.
this body bag. Corpse not pretty.
but there's a replacement.
back to good news.
this morning it arrived from paris.
just like in scrapbook.
Oh! It is.
Oh! Just like my scrapbook I don't remember keeping
and haven't looked at since I was an early adolescent.
Oh, I-It must be from daddy.
tonight is going to be magical.
you know, prom hasn't exactly been going as planned.
the florists lost Blair's corsage.
someone bought up all the peonies,
and when I called to confirm my limo, It had been rented out by a bachelorette party in jersey.
the heart quickens.
Yeah, well, my hotel room was mysteriously canceled,
and now I just found out blair's dress has been ruined.
how tragic.
I gotta ask...
am I sabotaging your dream prom?
the answer is no, Nathaniel.
and I don't know how many times We need to have this conversation.
Blair is yours.
Oh, what a restorative nap that was.
I feel so much better.
well, I'm afraid that moment is not going to last.
Eric out of earshot?
I sent him to a movie with Jonathan.
so no one can hear me scream. You're gonna what, Lily,
hack me to pieces, suffocate me with a pillow?
I am simply-- And for the last time
gonna ask you to leave my home and never come back.
never is a, uh, very long time, darling.
you are toxic. - I'm your mother.
and a memorable one at that, so much so it seems that try as I might,
I can't help turning into you.
well, maybe that's 'cause
you blame me for everything.
and you accept responsibility for nothing.
you know, maybe Carol's right.
the only way to have a normal life is without you in it.
your sister was rebellious and ungrateful for my love, and look where she ended up.
from where I'm sitting, it doesn't look so bad.
I don't want you meddling With my family or with my love life anymore.
I want you out, now.
Hi. I'm looking for my sister Carol. Carol rhodes.
uh, I think that she works here. Is she in?
I'm covering four extra tables today, so that'd be no.
flaking on work-- That seems like Carol.
do you know where she might be?
watch where you're going, spaz.
you almost got udon all over my gucci.
personally, I don't see it.
see what?
the family resemblance.
to Carol? Wait. You know her?
well, do you know where she might be?
trying to work here.
well, you missed a spot.
it's kinda sticky.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've had a really rough day. I got kicked out of school,
my dad doesn't want me to live with him, I can't stand my mom,
I spent the last $9 that I had on gas, and so now I'm broke and I'm homeless,
and unless I can find my sister, who I basically Haven't talked to in, like, a year,
I'm gonna have to become a prostitute.
and I don't even know how to be a prostitute.
I mean, really, how much small talk is required?
and--and where do you even go? And are b.J.S a must?
because if that's the case, I am so not doing that.
not that any of thatnformation is relevant unless you're a john.
not a john. Owen.
there's a gig at the 607 tonight.
chances are your sister will be there.
my friend's kinda dating her.
if you wanna go...
on a double date? With a guy that I just met five minutes ago?
you could be a psycho.
my shift ends in ten. Probably see your sister.
don't want to come, I'll give her your regards
and summarize the whole, uh, prostitute thing.
I could change.
I have my suitcase in the car.
Yeah. I'm just guessing, But I don't think that's gonna work.
you should try something like this.
your sister's always changing for auditions and stuff.
she's really changed.
I can't believe that she has this.
we went ice skating at Rockefeller center.
she snuck me out of the house.
it was so much fun.
we were, like, best friends.
you can go now.
already out the door.
Oh, hello, Daniel.
Hey. So, uh, look, I'm really sorry to bother you,
but I can't leave Serena one more message and still call myself a man.
not that it's exactly manly to be calling her "mother,
but I-I-I-I really need to know, Uh, how mad is she?
Oh, I-I wouldn't worry.
she hasn't gotten your messages.
they take your cell phone away when you're in jail.
wait.
she's--she's still in jail?
Hey. I think I need a dress for prom.
okay. But you're gonna have to wear your own shoes.
get out, perv!
sorry.
you're taking long enough.
do I looks like I'm wearing a halloween costume?
no. You look good.
is this the moment where you fall in love with me?
Oh, it is, isn't it?
you're totally falling in love with me right now.
are you coming or not?
hello. I'd like to drop the charges against Serena Van Der Woodsen.
there's been a terrible misunderstanding.
well, you can talk to someone about the charges,
but your daughter's gone.
wow, you're, like, really popular around here.
Yeah, when you don't have a lot of family at home, You gotta find it somewhere else.
it's kinda cool, right?
sure. Yeah, cool place to catch hepatitis.
missed our set, man! It was awesome.
it was like... it was wicked! Ha ha!
Shep, hey.
Hey, who's the betty? This your new girl?
no. - No.
we're looking for her sister.
no time to talk, guys. Your needs are gonna have to wait.
I have a plan. Actually, you know, it's more than a plan.
it's a mission. But it's not just about me.
it's about my lady. She's been wronged, and I'm gonna make it right.
what did they do to your lady, tattoo the wrong butt cheek?
my 20s are ticking away as we speak, And we gotta go now!
what are you doing here?
what are you guys doing with my sister?
wait. She's--She's your sister?
she's your lady? - Kind of.
No! Lily, oh, my god. It's so good to see you.
how do you know Owen?
I'm so sorry I haven't written more or called, like, ever.
are you totally mad?
wait. What are you doing in l. A? Is something wrong?
is everything okay?
Yeah. No, not really.
I have--I have to talk to you about something, and it's kind of major.
okay, and I wanna hear about it, I mean, totally there for you,
but right now I have to handle something, and it cannot wait.
I know.
neither can this.
we'll talk in the car.
to the impala.
to the what? Where?
the mission is on the move.
Oh, my god, Lily. It's so good to see you. I've missed you.
are you wearing my dress?
Oh, my god. Look at this place.
I've always tried to make my life resemble the movie in my head,
and tonight, no effort required. Voil?
vote for prom king and queen?
we don't do prom queen.
that's for suburban schools and the lame teen comedies that are set at them.
we're doing it this year.
there's a tiara and everything.
a tiara?
but if you don't want to vote for yourselves...
we were nominated. - Let's see.
I mean, of course we were.
you guys, I think I'm getting sentimental.
it's true. This is probably our last huddle.
Yeah, if you do this stuff in college, People think you're pathological.
come on, ladies. Let's commit election fraud.
I can't wait to see Blair's face When she loses prom queen to Nelly.
and look, I-I know this thing with your mom took oa life of its own, but I just want to say that I'm sorry for starting it in the first place.
it was just really upsetting that-- you went to her without giving me a warning.
I know, and normally I would never do something like this,
but Lily is not like other parents.
with good judgment, morals and maternal instinct?
and when she said that she was gonna take care of it,
I never imagined that you'd end up incarcerated.
the most frustrating part is She thinks she did take care of it.
Hey, soldier, eyes up front.
well, I'm, uh, I'm glad you let me bail you out or let me call cece to, 'cause missing your prom just to spite your own mother is kind
thank you for--For getting me to see that,
and thank you for breaking the cycle of crazy.
so what happened to the beemer that mom and dad got you?
Oh, I sold I.
for this? - As if.
I gave it to this guy.
he had this really amazing idea.
it goes around your waist like a belt So you can put stuff in it, like a purse.
that's a really sound investment.
what's that supposed to mean?
nothing. Nothing.
it just--Your life isn't exactly how you described.
you told mom that you were making it out in l. A.
I am making it. This is what making it looks like...
before you've totally made it.
Carol, I've always thought That you were really, really talented.
it's just-- Is it really worth...
living your life, you know...
like this?
well, it's not forever.
not once we get shep's music video on mtv.
I'm totally the star. A music video equals national exposure.
it's the birth of a new art form.
Really? Shep's band?
okay, I know you probably wouldn't think so having met Shep, but they're actually kinda great.
well, if they're so great, then why don't you give their demo to dad?
because he's dad, and I'm doing this on my own.
listen, don't tell anybody about who we are.
especially them.
why do you care what they think?
and besides, being us is awesome.
all that money comes with strings attached, Lily.
people treat you differently.
Yeah, better.
could you sound any more like mom?
of course I sound like mom.
she's the only female role model I've had since you bailed on us.
I think we're here.
I never wanted to be like my mother.
I wanted to be open to life and--And fearless
and not always thinking three steps ahead--And consequences
and what would people say or what would my father think.
well, you have, for the most part,
with a few notable exceptions.
that beautiful dinner you made--You were gonna propose, weren't you?
but you didn't.
because what I did to Serena made you fundamentally question the kind of person that I am.
you're unpredictable, that's for sure.
when I was younger, that was damn exciting.
you were always surprising me.
I'm just doomed to repeat my mother's mistakes.
why do you always have to do that?
dad, wait. Please don't walk away.
our mistakes are ours alone to repeat... or correct.
I should forgive Serena for defying me.
or first maybe you need to forgive Cece.
Oh, my mother doesn't need forgiveness. She needs electroshock therapy.
you've got good reason to be angry with her
those messed up values she passed on to you.
I'll follow you back.
until you let it go,
how can you move forward with your own daughter?
Cece's never gonna change, Lily.
but you still can.
thank you, Rufus.
I'm glad we can talk, but as for everything else,
I just don't know where we stand right now.
even after 20 years, You're still not sure who I am.
it's not that I'm not sure.
it's just, I think you're still figuring it out.
and she sticks the landing.
so is information on this mission Revealed on a need-To-Know basis?
the so-Called director of our music video took our money and then jacked up his fee, and now he's holding our video hostage, and I am a hostage negotiator.
Yeah, just 'cause this dork's uncle is John Landis doesn't mean he's above the law.
no Richie rich film school kid rips off me and my girl.
Shep, I'm not your girl.
right. She's-- She's more like my muse.
Oh, sweet hand towels.
so are we, like, breaking and entering? Seriously?
the window was unlocked, so really, it's just... entering.
and I thought investing in purse belts was a bad idea.
Thanks, lily.
since I know how much you love following the rules,
why do?
where people are actually having fun?
Owen, can you keep an eye on her?
what?
just because my idea of a good time isn't getting arrested for breaking into some guy's house,
I'm automatically a stuck-Up goody two-Shoes?
it doesn't exactly make you the life of the party.
Where's the bar?
I think it's this way.
you made it!
there was a last minute change of plans.
Yeah, I sprung her out of the pokey.
you can-- You can thank me later.
well, I just spent ten seconds talking to you, so consider yourself repaid.
have fun.
so, you know, not that I imagined, much about my time at prom, but, um... it measures up.
did you ever imagine yourself dancing at prom?
that I did.
well, I am here to make dreams come true. Come dance with me.
bailing you out of prison And dancing with you at prom in one night?
Yeah, I'm here to make things interesting.
Hey, Van Der Woodsen, you want some?
Hey, Keith!
surprised to see me?
Carol. Hey.
you, uh, you look amazing.
Really? Even more amazing than in the video you won't give us?
look, I'm sorry about that.
I just uh, I couldn't think of any other way to get you to call me
so I could explain
you have a girlfriend. Nothing else to explain.
I just want the video.
Hey. Who is this?
is she available?
Nah, man.
Nah, she, uh, she was just leaving.
no, I wasn't.
Oh, is this the moment where you fall in love with me?
it is, isn't it?
you're totally falling in love with me right now.
spare me, Keith!
this is low, even for you.
I can't believe you did this, Chuck.
you know how important prom is to me!
Blair, what's wrong?
I caught him with these.
they're all marked with Nelly Yuki's name. He's sabotaging me.
my missing corsage, my dress, the limo and hotel?
we paid you 500 bucks to shoot that thing.
we were friends then. I was giving you a special rate.
our relationship's changed now.
you can pay me the balance in cash Or... I don't know...
what are you doing saturday?
gross. My sister would never sleep with you.
yeah,'cause she's dating me.
Shep, we're not dating. We were never dating.
well, both of you don't know Carol very well,because, yeah, she totally slept with me.
pretty fun, too.
you slept with your music video director?
I didn't know he had a girlfriend, And I broke it off as soon as I found out.
but what he wants to chargus?
might as well be a million bucks.
and I know you probably think I should ask mom and dad for the money, but...
whatever. I'll think of something. It's fine.
no, Carol. It's not fine.
Hi. I'm lily Rhodes, and
and no one treats us this way.
okay. We already called the cops, so...
you guys are trespassing.
it's cool, okay? We're done here.
finally, take the trash back to the valley.
what did you just say? - What did you just say?
don't you have anything better to do, Like get your butt tattooed?
the only tattoo I'm getting tonight is your face on my fist.
ladies, come on. No need to fight over me.
okay. Okay.
how about we just fight you?
I got him. - Lily!
go, go, go. Get them!
where do you think you're going?
leave him alone!
students, if I could have your attention, please.
our prom queen is...
I can't believe you're not even defending yourself.
lie to my face! Blame someone! Something!
I'm sorry. Just one moment.
Seriously? - I know how to count.
our prom queen is...
but that's impossible!
Oh, my god. I won.
this is my moment.
I own prom.
and our king
Oh, my gosh! This is so great!
thank you!
Oh. Thanks.
thank you, everyone.
Oh, I can't believe Blair won.
Yeah, who even voted for her?
me. About 150 times.
I wasn't putting the Nelly Yuki ballots in.
I was taking them out.
but what about what she said you did to her limo and hotel and her corsage?
her new dress looks better without it.
give this to her.
it's to the penthouse at the plaza.
you didn't think you were the only one who knew about the scrapbook, did you?
Chuck, I...
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...
that was really sweet.
I just wanted to make sure she had the perfect night.
your 2009 king and queen!
who knew the mother-Chucker could also play fairy godmother?
but if c. just made b.'s dreams come true, why does it feel like
you can't use the one you already have on file?
wait. Let me at least fix my makeup.
are you ready to do the workout?
beginner's workout. Stand with your feet a little more...
jail?
you're in jail?
I know, mom. I'm--I'm sorry.
you know, if I was a better mother, I'd leave you in there, teach you a lesson.
you ran away. You just abandoned me at the side of the road.
you know they only give you one phone call, right?
Oh, Lily, the hopes and dreams I have for you
an Ivy League Education, life on the upper east side,
married to the richest man
see, that's the thing, mom
those are your hope and your dreams, not mine.
I need to figure out what-- What I want, what I need.
like a parole officer? I'm getting in the car.
you need to be far away from your sister's influence.
that she does what she wants and not wh other people tell her to do?
how about your spare me the heartache and yourselfhe humiliation
and give up on this failed experiment in rebellion?
what if this is not an experiment?
what about if this is me growing up?
enough soul searching. I'm calling your father's lawyer.
we need to keep this thing out of the papers.
please, mom, I don't need a publicist.
I need my mother.
I'm trying to talk to you here, and you're not...
Hey, mom. Got a sec?
this is your chance to be a big sister
and finally offer some actual guidance to Lily, advice.
her future's at stake.
which is why she needs to be far away from you.
this is how it's going to be, mom.
Lily's staying with me for a while.
Carol, just be reasonable.
we both know the first time that she breaks a nail,
rides a city bus
actually steps foot in a public school, She'll come running home.
well, that's really up to Lily, now isn't it?
just tell her to--To sit tight. I'm coming for her.
no, mom. You sit tight. She'll call you later.
Oh, goodness.
mother. Mom.
don't tell me you're chasing me out of town.
I'm fleeing as fast as I can.
well, please stop.
I'm not going to apologize, but I love you, and I know you love me.
well, of course I love you, my daughters, my grandchildren.
my only motivation is love.
on the contrary, your motives are quite suspect, selfish even.
and you haven't always done what's best for me.
well, I've done the very best I could.
you think Serena's a handful?
I would rather have 20 Dan Humphreys from Brooklyn instead of that boy you loved from the Valley.
well, you took care of that, didn't you?
and you ended up with Serena and Eric And the life you deserve.
it wasn't up to you to decide what kind of life I should have.
what else does it mean to be a mother than to make sure that your child fulfills her destiny?
well, I wanted to create my own destiny.
but that would have meant losing you, And I was always too afraid to do that.
until this afternoon, evidently.
mother, please, I'm just asking you to stay.
you know, being a mother myself, I've made mistakes.
that rival if not outshine your own.
and I forgive you.
lucky me.
you throw me out of your home, and I get forgiven.
mother, just say thank you and give me a hug.
I most certainly am not gonna thank you For the terrible things you said.
and as far as the hug goes, Well, you've always done exactly as you pleased, haven't you?
Hey. You okay?
this is supposed to be the happiest day in high school.
so why do I feel so sad?
like something's ending?
well, something is ending.
high school.
not just school.
you're my first love.
going to my senior prom with you Is something I've wanted since I was 12 years old.
and here we are, Like it was meant to be.
Yes. This was supposed to happen.
I'm sure of it.
but now it has and
why are you talking in the past tense?
we're still here.
I know.
but this night already feels like a memory.
just hold me...
until the song's over.
let's not waste these last moments talking about it.
okay.
there you are.
Where's the prom king?
we broke up.
what?
but--but everything was so perfect.
it w--It was like a fairy tale.
it turns out fairy tales end when they do for a reason.
I really wanted to go to prom with my high school boyfriend.
and... now that I have...
he feels like your high school boyfriend.
I'm sorry.
me, too
that you almost missed prom Because your mother had you arrested...
and your quasi half-Brother/ex-Boyfriend Was your prom date.
you know, I actually had a lot of fun tonight.
Dan and I made up, and I know that whatever my mother did,
she--she did out of love.
and right now, I am with exactly who I want to be with.
my best friend.
so thank you.
well, it's the least I can do Since I got you arrested and everything.
I didn't know you were such a brawler.
neither did I.
I learned some things last night...
the biggest one being...
that I've really missed you.
you are high school to me
alof the boyfriends And mean girls and
and tests and teachers And our crazy mothers...
we--we went through it together.
we raised each other.
you're my sister.
so where's your car?
how do you think I got you out of here?
you sold your car?
what are we gonna do? We're gonna walk?
walking in l. A? Wow, sis. I have so much more to teach you.
come on. It's us. We travel in style no matter how we travel.
shoulder pads may come and go, but a b. f.f. is forever...
because even when you're not sure where you're headed,
it helps to know you're not going there alone.
no one has all the answers,
and sometimes the best we can do is just apologize
and let the past be the past.
other times, we need to look to the future
and know that even when we think we've seen it all, life can still surprise us,
and we can still surprise ourselves.
X. O.X. O.gossip girl.
look, alive, people!
she was so furious that my cotillion dress was associated with Serena's sickening sex tape.
everything must be perfect.
and "perfect" does not include tabloid contraband.
hand it over.
get this out of my sight.
my mother cannot see that revenge smut.
on second thought, you go with it.
how dare Humphrey write that I am conniving, manipulative, and stuck in high school?
I am not all scheme and no substance.
hell have no fury like a lonely boy scorned.
well, he doesn't matter.
when my mother sees the dress orders, she will be so busy singing my praises that she won't have time to pay attention to...
pay attention to what, Blair?
what don't you want me paying attention to?
mother! Welcome home!
what is this,"downton abbey"? Everyone, back to work!
Dorota, when did you become a seamstress?
get my bags, take them back to the house and start keeping it.
this is not fooling anyone.
you. Office. Now.
I know you're upset, mother, but my cotillion dress has already been ordered by the three b's.
Barneys, Bergdorf's, and the lesser but still relevant Bloomingdale's.
I achieved your goal.
at the cost of my company's reputation.
a few sales do not make up for a runway strip show and sex tapes, and bandage dresses without the-the bandages.
well, I admit a shift in marketing strategy may be called for.
no, the-the issue goes deeper than that, Blair. It's you.
you and your - your split personality.
well, you must be referring to my ability to multitask.
I am referring to your dark and scheming and, frankly, sexually inappropriate side.
I like to think of myself as open-minded?
for as long as I can remember, you have struggled between your two natures.
I know that you are a beautiful, intelligent, ambitious young businesswoman.
but if you want to continue to run my multimillion-dollar corporation, the deviant half has to go.
for good!
I understand. There won't be an issue.
my Grace Kelly can defeat my Grace Jones, no problem.
well, honestly, I've - I've slept so much better since you found out that Lola returned the money from Cece's estate to me.
I'm really sorry I kept that a secret from you.
I'm just glad everything's out in the open and you had the money to save the gallery in time for tonight's opening.
I'm so excited it's finally happening.
are there any last-minute details you want me to take care of?
well, we need to give the caterer a final head count.
do you remember how many r. s. v. p. s we had?
I never checked, but... I'm sure everyone's coming.
what's wrong?
well, this can't be right. They're all regrets.
what happened to your art world connections?
no "art forum" editor.
no major collectors. Hey, even Bex said "no."
what the hell happened?
you surfing the empire cctv again? What, is Olivia Munn staying here?
wrong place.
this is the security footage from the Van Der Woodsen building.
how'd you get your hands on that?
well, Vanya can't be bribed, but the night doorman was remarkably open to a cash payment.
so what are you looking for?
when Ivy was in the apartment, she said Bart walked in with an envelope he held on to rather tightly.
I was hoping to see a return address or some distinguishing marks.
did you find anything?
indeed.
the envelope had the seal of the first international bank of Sudan.
the fincial records from his illegal oil trade?
I assume so, but Bart closed all the accounts that morning.
and he's not about to show you what's in the envelope or tell you where it is.
he won't, but someone else might.
Bruce Caplan dropped the envelope off to Bart that morning.
the Bass business manager? He won't spill any of Bart's secrets to you.
he won't, but if the head of "the spectator" were to ask for business management advice...
he might accidentally let something slip.
especially if it's the kind of meeting that loosens lips.
okay. Yeah. Thank you.
well, I figured out why no one's coming to our opening.
turns out there's a huge benefit tonight at the Conrad for the art production fund.
guess who's hosting. Lily.
she must've figured out when you were planning on opening your gallery, scheduled her own benefit to sabotage you.
well, it's not just me she's sabotaging.
it's my artists, too. This group show was a big deal to them.
how am I gonna explain that no one's coming because of my vindictive ex-wife?
well, everyone would still come if her event was canceled.
Oh, she's not gonna cancel a huge benefit for me.
she won't even take my call.
I'm not calling her.
I'm calling the art production fund. I feel like donating some money.
good morning, Daniel. - Good morning.
thank you for letting me stay in Eric's room.
can I make you and Bart a cup?
Oh, no. I'm good, thanks.
and Bart is out of town.
I'm on my way to Via Quadronno to meet the girls before my benefit meeting.
how's that going, by the way?
I forgot how much I enjoy throwing a party without having my husband standing over my shoulder, judging me.
I mean Rufus, of course, not Bart.
forgive me, Daniel.
you can never offend me with the truth.
nonfat cappuccino, extra foam, no sugar.
you remembered.
Yeah, well, it's been a while, almost as long as since we woke up in the same apartment together.
unless you count the Waldorfs'. Remember?
I certainly forgot this was coming out today.
Yeah. We've both burned a lot of bridges this year.
but at least we have each other.
and I couldn't be more grateful for you letting me camp out, but I-I don't want to overstay my welcome.
I finally got my first paycheck for "vanity fair,"
so I think it's time for me to find my own place and let you get back to your life.
Yeah. I mean, we can't hide out here forever.
but, hey, if you-if you need to find a new place, I- I know someone who knows everyone, who has terrific instincts for real estate, and who happens to have an afternoon free to look at apartments with you.
who?
right. Yeah, that's you. Okay.
so do you have any idea what neighborhood you want?
I can't get far enough away from my dad right now, so Brooklyn's out.
so upper east side?
I was-I was thinking lower.
what's funny about that?
Oh, I know you like the idea of saying you live in an L. e. s. Walk-up, but we both know you well enough to know you secretly long for a condo in the west village.
fine. A doorman would be nice, but I'll just lie about how much rent I pay.
okay, let's take a cab to west fourth then.
no, we got a ride.
you bought a vespa?
that's right. I forgot how much you like vespas.
but I got so used to driving one around Italy this summer that I decided I couldn't live without.
here. Hop on.
Serena! Serena! Hey, I loved that sex tape! Serena, Serena, over here!
no.
turn around and give me a smile, Serena.
when's the sequel? Talk to us.
spotted - S. And D. getting cozy again.
even I have to admit they sure look cute on that scooter.
Oh, my gosh. That was amazing!
you were - You were like Jason Bourne, riding up on the sidewalk.
you know, that sex tape - I knew it went viral, but I didn't expect that.
well, given the media circus, maybe today's not the day to be searching for apartments.
nobody wants a tenant trailed by tmz.
that's great. All right, we should probably get off the streets.
Yeah. I could use a drink.
you know what? I know a place where no one will think to look for us.
perfect.
thank you.
So,Bruce, is there anything else I can get you?
crystal and cristal is my favorite combination.
but maybe we'd better get to that urgent business matter you mentioned.
well, there are certain things about "the spectator" finances.
I would like to remain confidential.
I wonder if you could advise me on the safest way to keep those hidden.
storing confidential information is... A specialty of mine.
but I like to work on a client-by-client basis.
could you give me some examples?
I'm sorry. Uh, my clients depend on my discretion.
besides, I don't want to talk about that now.
send me your books. I'll make a recommendation.
in the meantime, I... would like to take the rest of this... meeting... elsewhere.
don't forget your jacket.
Thanks.
why did you let him leave without getting the information?
he wasn't gonna give it to me, so I figured i'd just take it.
I will admit you have taken steps.
like the-the peonies were an elegant addition to the handwritten apologies you sent to each of the board members of the cotillion.
and Poppy did seem touched by my donation to her charity for children who can't smile.
sound like Miss Blair show great grace and dignity.
Yes, that's right, Dorota.
my mother has shown me the errors of my way.
so now you can return to paris, reassured that your company's on the straight and narrow.
let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I said steps, as in the first of many on the road to recovery.
well, I have already admitted that I am powerless over my schemihe and that my life has become unmanageable.
what else is there?
amends to the fashion community which informs the masses.
Hello, Blair.
I had Dorota prepare a light lunch.
I'll let you girls... Chat.
how could someone who hides everything for everyone else pick his birthday for his password?
I underestimated you, Nathaniel.
well, you're not the first person to say that, but there's nothing under the international bank of Sudan.
then pull up my father.
Bruce said he had different methods for hiding information for different clients.
maybe there's a record of it.
there's nothing here but addresses and phone numbers.
then look at the calendar the morning he dropped off the envelope.
maybe there's a clue to where he went.
wait. There's an entry here from the morning.
it says "bass traffic."
I'm sorry. We're not open to the public just yet.
Oh, we have an appointment.
Rufus Humphrey. This is Ivy Dickens.
Benedict Tate. I'm doing p. r. for tonight's event.
so please, how can I be of assistance?
we would like to purchase all of the artwork.
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but tonight's silent auction is expected to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars.
how many hundreds?
5? 7?
you know, 8 has always been a lucky number for me.
so now you can, uh, cancel your expensive party and send everyone home.
I'm-I'm sorry. I think there's been a misunderstanding.
I am happy to deliver all the artwork to you after the event, but it's too late an hour to cancel.
and, well... we need something on the walls.
then I have an idea that may help you raise even more money.
when we came here on our first date, you didn't know how to hold the cue.
did you spend the last five years taking billiard lessons?
I could always play.
you hustled me. - Well, no.
I-I just wanted to make you feel better after your epic french ordering failure.
or maybe you were looking for an excuse for me to put my arms around you.
a girl never reveals her secrets.
unless you're gossip girl.
Spotted-two old flames.
who doesn't love a sequel?
did she give our exact location?
Yeah, which means our mob of new friends are probably already camped outside.
we're just fueling their fire by being together.
why don't I go out front with the vespa?
I'll distract 'em, and you just sneak out back and grab a taxi.
well, we don't have to go right now. I'm just about to win.
please. Let's-let's not make my humiliation official.
and the sooner we get out of here, the better.
this was nice, though.
traffic. Traffic jam. Traffic light.
maybe they had a meeting in a car.
or it's Bart's oil trafficking or something else he's illegally selling.
like a nuclear bomb in a briefcase.
you watch too many movies.
so does Bruce.
wait. That's it.
the movie "Traffic" is right here.
I remember in that film, the head of the drug cartel stored his illegal account information in the back of a painting.
what, you think that's where Bart hid whatever was in the envelope?
well, there's a lot of paintings in the Van Der Woodsen apartment.
I'm just, unfortunately, still banned from the building.
I guess I'll have to pay them a visit.
so I called and I called and I called and I called, and then I just never heard from him again.
is that the end of the story?
you really are so... Entertaining.
so when my mother returns, tell her that I apologized and that we're best friends.
I'm sorry, Blair. This was fun, but I won't do that because it's not the truth.
Yes, it is. - No, it's not.
Yes, it is. - No, it's not.
Yes, it is. - No, it's not.
I have been cordial to you for the last... 52 minutes.
do you have any idea the psychological torture that I have endured being nice to you?
I should have just skipped ahead to this from the start.
it that me as Mrs. Mingott in a fat suit?
that was embarrassing.
agreed, which is why you don't want this bouncing around the blogosphere.
no one wants to take fashion advice from her.
mother!
ladies, how are we getting along?
famously.
Blair just tried to blackmail me.
I'm sorry, Eleanor. I tried.
this is all Nelly's fault.
she was clearly lying because she's always been jealous of me.
the only thing clear is that Daniel Humphrey was right about you.
you read that dreck? - On the plane.
and his-his central thesis is correct.
you are running my business like you're still the meanest girl in high school.
I am trying.
relapse is part of recovery. Please, just give me one more chance.
I'm sorry, Blair. It's over. I can't.
I have no other choice but to demote you and take back the presidency of Waldorf designs, effective immediately.
watch out, b.
they say you're only as good as the company you keep, and right now you're not keeping any.
what's going on?
why are you taking down the paintings for my event?
I think you mean our event.
since everyone in the art world is coming here tonight instead of my gallery opening,
I decided to have my opening here.
that's outrageous.
I'm gonna talk to Benedict and have him reinstall my art immediately.
well, that would be difficult since we own it all now.
Lily, welcome.
I see you've met our new event co-sponsors.
I have, and I'm not thrilled that my carefully curated pieces are being replaced without even so much as a phone call.
well, I'm sorry.
I never imagined that you'd object to raising more money for such a worthwhile cause.
Lily, Rufus and Ivy have helped a. p. f. break fund-raising records.
certainly, sharing your hosting duties is a-a small price to pay.
of course, which is why you've inspired me to make my own additional donation, which I am sure will break their record.
hold it right there, humph-freak!
do you have any idea what a mess your article has made?
no, but I'm guessing you're gonna tell me even if I keep walking.
my mother demoted me, thanks to your disparaging drivel.
right, and I'm sure it had nothing to do with your work-related behavior.
fix this, or when I'm done with you, you won't even have Georgina Sparks' couch in Brooklyn.
I will fly Vanessa back from whatever third-world country she's in if I have to.
do you hear yourself?
you're trying to bully me into retracting an article about you being a bully.
no.
I'm proving to my mother that I am the mature, polite, professional woman who should be running Waldorf designs.
Blair, you tracked me down with your "spotted" map and threatened me with the return of Vanessa.
you are not mature, polite, or professional, and even your own mother knows it.
do you think you could meet me at Lily's benefit tonight?
there's something I think you would want to hear.
and you're sure there's nothing?
there's nothing in any of this art.
it could be subtle. Tape on the backing or rip in the seam.
no, there's nothing. And the back of artwork is really boring.
hold on one second. Someone's coming.
Nate? What are you doing here?
I am just writing a story on Lily's artwork for "the spectator."
Oh, for the a. p. f. benefit tonight?
Yeah. Exactly. What are you up to?
uh, just rereading an old short story.
Hey, is everybody a writer these days?
It-no, it's Dan's.
aren't you getting enough of him in "vanity fair"?
it's the one from "The New Yorker."
you know, the story about the first time he saw me at that party.
do not tell me in some twisted turn of events that that sex tape made you miss him.
no, it's just... We spent some time together, and... I don't know.
it - It brought up some old memories.
Serena, you're really vulnerable right now after steven broke up with you.
it's too soon to have real feelings for Dan.
but what if those feelings never really went away?
that high school kid you fell in love with - That's not who he is anymore, okay?
he almost cost me "the spectator" to sell his serial.
and he exploited all of us in those chapters.
I know. You're right.
I mean, he has become a selfish egomaniac who will... - Serena
destroy his friends for-for money and attention, for fame and...
I know how much you like chocolate-covered strawberries.
Dan, wait.
Hey, listen, I better get going.
wait. What about the auction serena mentioned? Look around.
is there anything missing?
that painting of the rainbow woman is gone.
my Richard Phillips has arrived.
Lily, are you sure?
you know, it's one of my favorite pieces in my collection, but it is for a good cause.
and I've already sent Bart an e-mail, and I know he will agree.
this is incredibly generous.
in fact, we're gonna have a live auction just for this special piece.
I know she will be the star of the show.
this work of art appears to be a work of Bart.
let the bidding begin.
this is Spencer Sweeney, Patrick Mcmullan, and Fab Five Freddy.
good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the art production fund benefit.
first, I'd like to say a special thanks to Rufus Humphrey and Ivy Dickens for their tremendous contribution tonight.
careful, Lily. You paid a lot of money to fill those worry lines.
listen, you vile little interloper, you and Rufus may have rubbed your last two nickels together to replace my art, but the only people that you're making fools of are yourselves.
but tonight, folks, the centerpiece of this event will be a special live auction of Richard Phillips' "spectrum..."
courtesy of Lilian Bass' personal collection.
bidding will begin shortly.
as I was saying, you can pretend to be Lola, you can pretend to be Serena, but you will never be me.
I don't want to be you. I want to be better.
Rufus already thinks I am.
I always liked that painting.
I'm glad to see you two found each other.
Nelly was just telling me you invited her here to meet with her.
I hope it is to make an official apology.
that I'd love to hear.
I'm not here to apologize to Nelly, mother.
I'm here to apologize to you.
then what am I doing here?
shutting up and writing about it so you can publicly restore Waldorf designs' pristine reputation.
Blair, what is this about?
undoing all the damage my dark side has done.
I'm a bad seed, mother, so send me away to the village of the damned.
no one expects miracles, darling.
it's been part of you for 20-something years.
it's not going to go away overnight.
just maybe sometime before I die.
y - you don't understand. The real Grace Kelly had talent.
you have talent.
even that Goth princess Jenny Humphrey had talent.
but I don't. It's all just pretense.
well, your record of achievements prove otherwise.
everything I have was from scheming and lying and working the angles.
I don't have what it takes.
you are Mozart. I'm Salieri.
no matter how hard I work, I will never be you, and I think it was just my dark side trying to hide that.
so... effective immediately,
I resign from waldorf designs.
did you reach anyone from a. p. f. ?
I finally got ahold of an assistant, but she said they're only taking bids in person.
how far away are you?
at least ten blocks.
is there no way around this, like on the sidewalk?
I like that your artists reflect the same socially relevant projects we commission at art production fund.
and I like that you can see the street art influence.
I'm not talking about the '80s but the '40s.
Yeah, when artists were the stars of new york instead of celebutantes.
Yes. - Excuse me. Can I speak to you for a moment?
what can I do for you, Lily?
are you interested in one of my Pfahler pieces to replace your Phillips?
no, thank you, and I think you've made your point here, Rufus.
this is a benefit to raise money for a good cause, and I won't have your little freeloader making a mockery of it by bidding on things she can't afford.
Ivy can afford any painting she wants.
and with what money? I know it's not yours.
you're right. It's Cece's.
ladies and gentlemen, if we are ready to begin,
I would like to start the bidding for the Richard Phillips at $500, 000.
$500, 000. - I have $500, 000.
Lola gave it back to her when she found out your mother wanted Ivy to have it.
$500, 000. Going once? $500, 000. Do I have $520, 000?
520000.0
she may have been able to con Lola out of half my mother's estate, but she'll never get anything of mine.
do I have $540, 000? Going once?
$540, 000. - $560, 000.
$560, 000. Do I have $570, 000?
$570, 000. - $570, 000.
$570, 000. Do I have $580, 000?
$580, 000. - $580, 000. Do I have $600, 000?
750000.0
750000.0
I know it sounded bad, but you heard it out of context.
in what context can "selfish egomaniac" be positive?
I was telling Nate what a good time I had with you, but...
Yeah, I heard the "but" part.
but that it's confusing for me because I have spent the past few months hating you.
I told you I loved you, and then you rejected me for my best friend.
you've rejected me for nearly everyone on the upper east side.
can you blame me for having doubts?
you had more than doubts. You told me you never wanted to see me again.
you mean, after you used me to make a sex tape to destroy me and your best friend?
I'm not the bad guy here.
you want everyone to believe you're poor, sweet Dan Humphrey from Brooklyn, but you sent that video of Chuck and Blair into "gossip girl" to try to ruin her wedding, and then you pinned it on me.
Yeah, I didn't want Blair to marry the wrong man.
and it's not like you've never used "gossip girl" to further your own agenda.
Oh, wait. Oh, wait. You were gossip girl for a second.
only to restore balance after georgina's reign of terror.
Who-who is now partnering with you to attack and humiliate everyone that we care about in your exposes?
which leads us back to your reason for calling me a selfish egomaniac.
you're right. Now I-now I understand.
good. I'm glad.
I was being sarcastic, Serena.
so was I. - No, you weren't.
Yes, I was. - Look-look,
obviously, too much has happened over the past five years.
no matter who we are today, we can't undo the things we've done in the past, so it's probably best we just move on without each other.
which I will do the second we get out of this elevator.
$880, 000. I have $880, 000. Do I hear $900, 000?
900000.0
$900, 000. - What do you think you're doing?
$920, 000. - I'd ask you the same thing.
bidding on an item you put up for auction?
I changed my mind when this gypsy trash wanted it.
she will not have anything near and dear to my heart.
$940, 000 once? - $940, 000.
960000.0
I assure you I won't let her win if you stop bidding.
and why should I trust you?
I know you teamed up with this charlatan to cause problems with your father and me.
this painting means more to me than anything.
980000.0
what do you think you're doing? We're supposed to be on the same side.
so you are still aligned with her?
I'm on nobody's side but my own.
1 million. Do I hear 1. 2?
going once. Going twice.
sold for $1. 1 million to the man in front. Congratulations.
revenge is sweet, especially when you have a sugar mama.
unfortunately, not all families appreciate just desserts.
I just wanted to congratulate you and apologize.
I admit that I was out of line with some of the things that I said earlier.
and you obviously want something now.
well, I know how important it was for you to prove that you could best me publicly.
and now that you've achieved what you wanted,
I would love to buy my painting back.
well, if you wanted it so much, why'd you put it up for auction?
I had no idea how much it meant to me till it was gone.
and let's face it, Rufus.
do you really want that hanging in your loft, reminding you of me?
I don't.
we'll give it to a museum.
one far away from Manhattan where you won't even be able to visit.
surely there's a price that will change your mind.
no. You can't buy us off the way you do everyone else.
we don't want your money.
what is it you want then?
to make you feel the way you've made us feel.
humiliated and powerless and like you're worth nothing.
so if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make sure they're packing up our painting.
I'll see you later.
and you remain a kept man.
I never thought I would say this, Lil, but I think Ivy's right.
you brought this on yourself.
maybe you should try Vanya again.
it's been, like, 47 seconds since I called.
and unlike last time we were stuck here,I remembered to use your name.
Oh, if we're recreating that, you should probably try to crawl out of the ceiling any moment.
I admit that was not one of my better ideas.
why-why were you so mad about it, then?
because I didn't want you to get hurt.
I'm sure you want me to hit the floor right now.
throw me down the elevator shaft.
or, hell, you know, you could just trick me into making another sex tape.
it's the people you know best that you can hurt the most.
I'm sorry...
I didn't say anything when you told me you loved me.
it-it was easier to focus on my anger at Blair than face the possibility of getting what I always wanted and...and losing it again.
what you always wanted?
you know, I had... A really great time with you today.
I had to believe that you were terrible in order to protect myself.
well, you know, I could actually be terrible if you prefer.
no. No, thank you. I'm good. I - I much prefer you this way.
Yeah, the feeling's mutual.
I will try Vanya again.
well... I guess that's my cue.
or you could come up and have some chocolate-covered strawberries before you face the paparazzi.
Yeah. That sounds nice.
if you've come for a follow-up interview, I have no comment.
actually, I came to say thanks for the exclusive...
and maybe to gloat a little.
how did you know where to find me?
the met steps? Where else would you go to make yourself feel better?
my mother always said you'd peaked in high school.
you mean when no one else spoke to you besides your mother?
you can make fun of how unpopular I used to be, but the person no one cares about anymore is you.
then why are you still sitting below me on the steps?
habit. Like a headband.
just a remnant from when you were a tastemaker.
and all every girl at Constance wanted was to be just like me.
lucky for all of us, like the eco-clothing trend, those days are gone.
you obviously don't shop in Brooklyn.
but thank you, Nelly. Your misinformation has been invaluable.
where are you going?
you won't look good in hemp.
but you will, while you eat crow.
I just hope it's not too late.
thank you so much for letting us use your painting in the auction.
um, Todd Diciurcio, this is Chuck Bass.
it's a beautiful painting. Excuse us.
great work tonight. - No thanks to you.
I thought we were on the same team.
we are, which is why you souuld sell me that painting.
Lily already tried that.
I hope you turned her down.
that piece is a critical component of my campaign against bart.
as you know, if I topple him, Lily won't be far behind.
what's a queen without her king?
I'll sell you the painting...
for double what I paid.
that's a price I'm willing to pay.
all right,I'll have it delivered.
pleasure doing business with you.
Spotted-Ivy moonlighting as a gallerina.
better hope this masterpiece isn't a forgery.
is it weird to say I'm - I'm glad we got in that fight?
no, no. No, not at all. I am, too.
that storage unit I kept packed full of old resentments was getting pretty full.
you know, I-I feel like I did when I first came back to the city from boarding school, when all I wanted was a fresh start.
well, you have one now, at least with me.
I, uh, should probably take off. It's getting pretty late.
Oh, did you ever find a place?
technically, no. But, I mean, I got that check now, so...
I can afford a hotel room. I don't want to impose too much.
no, you're - You're not imposing at all.
are you sure? I mean, just this morning, you were saying you thought it might ruin our friendship.
well, I think if we could get through the last five years, then we could get through a few more nights.
so... Y-you can stay.
or you don't have to. You can go, too.
or you can stay. Whatever you want.
that's what I want.
I made a mistake. - Many. Who hasn't?
you'll have to be more specific, dear.
when I quit earlier.
I thought that I was using my dark side to hide the fact that I have no talent.
I wasn't the one who said you didn't have talent, Blair.
no, but you told me to squash my dark side, which is my talent. It's my inspiration.
you can't blackmail your way through business.
well, I agree, but...
I'm not talking about my management style, which I admit needs help to stay on the straight and narrow.
I'm talking about my designs.
Oh, Where is this coming from? - High school.
my Grace Kelly did have talent.
she got me straight a's and the perfect boyfriend.
but it was my Grace Jones that had everyone wanting to dress like me, not because they admired my hard work but because they were fascinated by my ferocity.
you did instill fear in the hearts of many.
I need to stop trying to be you and use my power to form the fashionistas of the future...
with a line for high school girls, inspired by my Constance uniform.
I'm not sure people want to wear uniforms if they're not in school.
these won't be the uniforms they have to wear.
they'll be the uniforms they beg to wear...
ones they see on the girls they want to be.
they own this town.
uniforms?
well, they do represent power and authority and instill a sense of belonging.
and the girls I dress won't follow trends.
they will set them, just like I did.
you always were very influential.
please. Give me one more chance to prove it.
so what do you expect to find?
the financial records of Bart's oil deal.
which, when I finally hand over to the FBI, will ensure he spends the rest of his days playing pinochle with Bernie Madoff.
thank you.
well, I guess it's not time to break out the handcuffs just yet.
where the hell is that envelope?
maybe "traffic" meant something else or we got the wrong painting.
no. No. Lily was too determined to get this one.
and the phillips in my bedroom has a backing on it.
then someone took it off.
then they've got the evidence!
remember that silver bullet we were looking for?
I found it.
you know, I really think it's time for you to come back.
the sooner, the better.
I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this.
I gotta go.
one pepperoni pizza, extra cheese to go with a bottle of dom perignon.
an unexpected yet brilliant combination, just like us.
the beatles sang, "living is easy with eyes closed."
Bart, I am so sorry.
I had no idea that's where you hid the records of your oil deals.
but even with our eyes open, we all still have blind spots.
or maybe we're just looking in the wrong place.
so this will be aimed at the 12-to-25 set.
marc Jacobs has "marc by..."
and Waldorf designs will have "b."
Oh, I just love that.
but when we finally do see the light, it's strawberry fields forever.
wait a second. Are you sure?
you ARE ONE AND ONLY SOURCE INTO THE SCANDALOUS LIVES OF MANHATTAN'S ELITE.
top STORY ON MY HOME PAGE
Serena VAN DER WOODSEN, EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE "IT" GIRL, HAS JUST RETURNED FROM A MYSTERIOUS ABSENCE.
you'll NEVER BELIEVE WHAT'S ON "GOSSIP GIRL."
someone SAW SERENA GETTING OFF???
and EVERYONE IS TALKING.
Blair, IT'S SERENA.
and BLAIR'S BOYFRIEND NATE-- RUMOR HAS IT
he's ALWAYS HAD A THING FOR SERENA.
but YOU'RE BACK NOW. I DIDN'T COME BACK FOR YOU.
look, BLAIR'S MY BEST FRIEND, AND YOU'RE HER BOYFRIEND,
and SHE LOVES YOU.
why DID SHE LEAVE? WHY DID SHE RETURN?
must BE A LOT OF RUMORS WHY YOU'RE BACK.
Yeah, BUT NONE OF THEM MENTION YOU.
he TRIES TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE, AND YOU'RE WORRIED
it's GONNA COST YOU, MOM? YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE.
the BEST FRIEND AND THE BOYFRIEND
won't LET SERENA FORGET ABOUT HER PAST.
I'm TRYING TO CHANGE. I LIKED YOU BETTER BEFORE.
and THEN THERE'S DAN, THE OUTSIDER.
looks LIKE HIS CHILDHOOD CRUSH HAS RETURNED.
she DOESN'T KNOW ME. NOBODY KNOWS ME. IT'S COOL.
no. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. UH, SERENA,
um, DO YOU KNOW THIS YOUNG MAN?
Oh, FROM LAST NIGHT. YOU REMEMBER ME?
you'd REALLY GO OUT WITH SOME GUY YOU DON'T KNOW?
well, HE CAN'T BE WORSE THAN THE GUYS I DO KNOW.
guess WHOSE DAD IS COOL. IT'S A TRICK QUESTION.
Yeah, 'CAUSE IT CAN'T BE OURS.
top TEN FORGOTTEN BANDS OF THE '90S." YEAH, CHECK OUT
he's VERY PROUD.
Hey! HEY, WAY TO BE FORGOTTEN.
why IS MY DAUGHTER GOING TO ONE OF YOUR CONCERTS?
well, OUR KIDS WERE BOUND TO MEET. IT'S A SMALL ISLAND.
are YOU SURE IT'S NOT SOME PLOY?
to GET TO ME NOW THAT YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU?
Serena AND HER MYSTERY MAN MADE A SURPRISE APPEARANCE AT BLAIR'S KISS ON THE LIPS PARTY.
Serena's HERE?
what IS SHE DOING HERE? SHE WASN'T INVITED.
but SERENA WASN'T THE ONLY ONE JENNY MADE AN IMPRESSION ON CHUCK.
let's GO AND TALK SOMEWHERE QUIETER.
get OFF! STOP!
Hey! THAT IS MY LITTLE SISTER!
don't YOU EVER TOUCH HER AGAIN!
Hey, YOUR LIFE IS OVER, SLUT!
she BETTER NOT SHOW HER FACE AGAIN.
I'm ACTUALLY HOPING SHE WILL.
you THINK I GOT A SHOT AT A SECOND DATE? WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT AND NOW THAT SERENA IS BACK, WILL THE UPPER EAST SIDE EVER BE THE SAME?
we're ALL JUST DYING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
I BET YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT GOSSIP GIRL IS DOING UP SO EARLY.
truth IS, I NEVER WENT TO BED.
why WASTE PRECIOUS TIME DREAMING WHEN WAKING LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER?
is THERE REALLY ANYTHING BETTER THAN A LAZY SUNDAY?
reading THE PAPER IN BED, SIPPING COFFEE, SCRAMBLING AN EGG OR TWO.
Yeah, RIGHT.
we UPPER EAST SIDERS DON'T DO LAZY.
breakfast IS BRUNCH, AND IT COMES WITH CHAMPAGNE, A DRESS CODE AND A HUNDRED OF OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS...
and ENEMIES.
Chuck's DAD, BART BASS, IS HOSTING THE ANNUAL BRUNCH FOR HIS FOUNDATION.
everyone IS INVITED.
well, NOT EVERYONE.
Oh. HEY, YOU'RE UP.
and YOU'RE CHECKING UP ON ME.
I'm OKAY. REALLY, I'M OKAY.
you KNOW, I WAS OKAY WHEN YOU ASKED ME AT THE PARTY
and IN THE CAB, WHEN WE GOT HOME,
before AND AFTER I BRUSHED MY TEETH.
look, I JUST FEEL REALLY STUPID.
I MEAN, HOW COULD I HAVE ACTUALLY THOUGHT
that CHUCK BASS JUST WANTED TO TALK TO ME?
because YOU TRUST PEOPLE,
which IS NORMALLY A GOOD THING.
Yeah, EXCEPT WHEN IT INVOLVES CHUCK. YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.
so THE REAL QUESTION IS, UH, HOW ARE YOU?
me?
why WOULDN'T I BE OKAY?
you KNOW, AT THE END OF THE NIGHT, WITH SERENA
and THE--THE--THE...
was IT REALLY THAT BAD?
this IS ME.
so... GOOD NIGHT.
Yeah.
Yeah. UM, YEAH, GOOD NIGHT.
go! WALK HER TO THE DOOR.
something. GO! OKAY.
Oh! OH, GOD. THAT HURT A LOT. WHOA, WHOA, STOP, STOP.
Aah! OH, I THINK I HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE. YOU KNOW WHAT, DAN?
you WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW IF YOU HAD BRAIN DAMAGE.
no, LET'S GO, PLEASE.
No!
h-hi.
so HE WAVED?
no, HE WAS JUST TRYING TO BE FUNNY.
maybe HE'S SHY. OR HE HATES ME.
no GUY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD HAS EVER HATED YOU.
she PROBABLY THINKS I HATE HER NOW.
I've WAITED MY ENTIRE ADOLESCENT LIFE FOR A DATE WITH THIS GIRL,
you KNOW, SERENA VAN DDSEN...
and I DECIDE TO CLOSE THE EVENING WITH A WAVE.
it WAS A NICE WAVE.
at THE END OF A DATE? COME ON, THERE'S NO SUCH THING.
and YOU ONLY GET ONE SHOT WITH A GIRL LIKE SERENA.
I GOT MINE, AND I BLEW IT.
which MEANS YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.
no, NOTHING EXCEPT MY LAST SHRED OF DIGNITY.
you're RIGHT.
you KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST-- I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HER.
I'm GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR THE WAVE.
I'm GONNA TELL HER HOW MUCH I LIKE HER,
and I'M GONNA ASK FOR A SECOND SHOT.
no, I'M GONNA GET A SECOND SHOT. YEAH, YOU ARE.
Yeah. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I LOVE THE PLAN,
but, UH, YOU NEED A BETTER OUTFIT.
and MAYBE A SHOWER.
whatever. IT'S PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.
the LAST THING I NEED IN MY LIFE IS A NEW GUY.
he WAS JUST SO SMART,
and-and FUNNY...
it SOUNDS LIKE YOU LIKE HIM.
and REALLY NICE.
God, BLAIR WAS SO MEAN TO ME LAST NIGHT.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY. WHATEVER.
I'm SURE IF WE TALK ABOUT IT, WE CAN WORK IT OUT.
Hey, MAYBE I SHOULD GO OVER THERE.
Serena HAD BETTER JUST STAY AWAY.
thank YOU, DOROTA. YEAH, THANKS.
we LOVE SLEEPING AT BLAIR'S.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE SERENA AT SCHOOL,
and SHE BETTER NOT SHOW AT BRUNCH TODAY.
you're REALLY MAD AT SERENA.
Yeah, I HOPE YOU NEVER GET THAT MAD AT US.
well, YOU WOULD NEVER DO
no, NEVER. OF COURSE NOT.
I WONDER IF NATE REMEMBERED BRUNCH.
it WOULD BE SO WRONG FOR ME TO SHOW UP
without MY BOYFRIEND WHOM I LOVE, AND WHO LOVES ME.
Hello?
Hi, SWEETIE. DID I WAKE YOU?
no, I'M UP.
well, GET SOME STRONG COFFEE
and JUMP IN THE SHOWER, SLEEPYHEAD.
Chuck's DAD'S BRUNCH FOR HIS FOUNDATION IS TODAY AT THE PALACE. OH, RIGHT. OF COURSE.
Nathaniel, KEEP IT DOWN.
some OF US ARE TRYING TO REGAIN OUR STRENGTH.
your DAD'S BRUNCH IS TODAY.
alarm's SET FOR 9: 00.
it's 10: 00.
ladies, DOUBLE-TIME.
Oh, UNLESS... NATHANIEL...
I'm GOOD.
actually, COULD YOU TWO BRING SOME COFFEE
when YOU GET A CHANCE? AND SOME WATER... LOTS OF WATER.
you WANT ICE WITH THAT?
looks LIKE YOU COULD USE SOME.
that's ENOUGH, LADIES.
and I'LL BE SURE TO TELL MY FATHER
just HOW COMMITTED YOU ARE TO THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY.
that KID POPPED YOU PRETTY GOOD, HUH?
never MESS WITH A GUY'S SISTER. AND IF I KNEW HIS NAME,
why, 'CAUSE YOU KILL PEOPLE NOW?
you GONNA STRANGLE HIM WITH YOUR SCARF?
don't MOCK THE SCARF, NATHANIEL. IT'S MY SIGNATURE.
I'm JUST SAYING,
death BY SCARF-- NOT THAT INTIMIDATING.
the FUCK PUNCHED ME. I TOLD YOU.
besides, BETTER A BROKEN NOSE THAN A BROKEN HEART.
what? I DIDN'T EVEN TALK TO SERENA LAST NIGHT.
who SAID ANYTHING ABOUT SERENA?
do I LOOK OKAY?
definitely SECOND-SHOT MATERIAL.
all RIGHT, THEN I'M GONNA GO.
Oh, UM,
and ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, YOU KNOW, WITH, UH, CHUCK?
if YOU WANNA, LIKE, TALK TO SOMEONE...
n-not YOUR BROTHER-- JUST LET ME KNOW.
okay.
Yeah, I'LL...
all RIGHT.
Hey, UH, WAIT.
actually, THERE IS SOMEONE I WANNA TALK TO.
Hey, HEY, WHERE YOU GUYS GOING?
I WAS GONNA MAKE WAFFLES. OOH. SORRY, DAD.
Yeah, CAN'T. BUT I WANNA HEAR ABOUT YOUR DATE.
later. AND YOUR PARTY.
when WE GET BACK.
you GUYS MISSED A REALLY GREAT SHOW,
and I MAKE REALLY GOOD WAFFLES.
palace HOTEL LOBBY. HI. THIS IS,
uh, NATE ARCHIBALD CALLING FROM THE BASS SUITE.
Hey, BLAIR. IT'S ME.
uh, I GUESS YOU'RE STILL SLEEPING,
but I'M GONNA COME OVER.
I THINK WE NEED TO TALK.
okay. UH, SEE YOU SOON. BYE.
as SOON AS THE GUESTS ARRIVE, WE CAN START DISHING.
here's WHAT'S ON THE MENU...
MOM,YOU TAKAE MY MICHEL PERRYS?
I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING IN HERE!
well, IT MIGHT HELP IF YOU UNPACKED.
look, YOU'RE HOME NOW.
it's YOUR LIFE. YOU SHOULD START LIVING IT.
this IS NOT LIFE, THIS IS A HOTEL
which WE'RE LIVING IN BECAUSE YOU DECIDED YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE COLOR OF THE WALLS IN OUR REAL HOME.
mom, I SAID I'D GO TO THIS BRUNCH.
what MORE DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
sweetie, WHY ARE YOU BEING LIKE THIS?
you LOVE PARTIES. THIS IS JUST NOT LIKE YOU.
maybe IT IS LIKE ME. MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M REALLY LIKE.
Oh, OKAY, TELL ME.
so DID YOU AND DAN HAVE FUN AT THE CONCERT LAST NIGHT?
we, UM, NEVER MADE IT.
we ACTUALLY ENDED UP AT THE KISS ON THE LIPS PARTY.
Ah. WELL, THAT MUST HAVE PLEASED BLAIR.
Blair? ACTUALLY, NO, NOT THAT PLEASED,
which IS WHY I'M GOING TO TALK TO HER.
well JUST BE BACK IN TIME FOR BRUNCH, OKAY? MOM.
look, HONEY, I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS FOR YOU TO BE BACK,
but THE MORE YOU HIDE YOURSELF AWAY,
the MORE PEOPLE ARE GONNA THINK YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE.
coming FROM SOMEONE WHO'S KEEPING MY BROTHER IN AN INSTITUTION.
that's DIFFERENT. I MEAN IT. DON'T BE LATE.
wait! THANKS.
Hey. HOW ARE YOU DOING?
uh, I-I WAS IN YESTERDAY WITH SERENA. HOW COULD I FORGET?
Yeah, WELL, UM, IS SHE IN?
Yeah.
just MISSED HER, ACTUALLY, BUT YOU'RE WELCOME TO WAIT.
okay, MAYBE I WILL.
she--she PROBABLY WON'T BE THAT LONG, RIGHT?
once SHE WENT OUT AND DIDN'T COME BACK FOR SIX MONTHS,
but FEEL FREE TO SIT.
over THERE.
over THERE IS WHERE I'LL BE.
Hi, NATE. IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.
Hi, MRS. VAN DER WOODSEN. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Oh, I'M JUST HEADING OUT.
Oh, IS SERENA IN? OH, YOU JUST MISSED HER,
but I'LL TELL HER YOU CAME BY.
I'm SURE SHE'LL BE HAPPY TO HEAR IT.
uh, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
Oh, WHAT? COME ON, SERENA LOVES YOU.
I MEAN, I THINK SHE'S ALWAYS HAD A LITTLE CRUSH ON YOU.
of COURSE, YOU AND BLAIR ARE THE PERFECT COUPLE.
Mm. IS SERENA GONNA BE LONG? I COULD JUST WAIT.
Nate's GONNA WAIT FOR SERENA.
great. HE CAN GET IN LINE BEHIND THAT GUY.
I HAD A FEELING YOU'D BE BACK.
Dan, IS IT?
Humphrey. YES.
it's NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MRS. VAN DER WOODSEN.
I HOPE YOU'VE HAD A PLEASANT, UH...
uh, 21 HOURS SINCE I LAST SAW YOU.
Yes, IT HAS BEEN VERY PLEASANT...
until NOW.
gentlemen.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, I GOT TWO BONE-DRY CAPS AND AUDREY.
I MUST HAVE TOTALLY BLANKED
on THE PART WHERE I INVITED YOU OVER.
I-I CALLED YOU.
Blair, IT'S SUNDAY MORNING.
coffee, CROISSANTS, "BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S.
it's OUR TRADITION.
I HAVE NEW TRADITIONS NOW.
well, THEY'RE NOT TRADITIONS IF THEY'RE NEW.
look, BLAIR, I'M REALLY TRYING TO MAKE AN EFFORT HERE.
I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS GOOD BETWEEN US.
it WAS BEFORE I FOUND OUT YOU HAD SEX WITH MY BOYFRIEND.
how'd YOU FIND OUT?
Nate TOLD ME.
at LEAST HE FELT HE OWED IT TO ME TO TELL THE TRUTH.
don't BOTHER SAYING ANYTHING.
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE YOU ANYWAY.
Blair, IT WAS...
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE A WHORE.
I NEVER TOOK YOU FOR A LIAR, TOO.
Blair, HOW CAN I FIX THIS?
you DON'T, SERENA.
you JUST STAY AWAY FROM ME,
my BOYFRIEND AND MY FRIENDS.
you're DONE HERE.
Serena's VISIT WAS SHORT
and APPARENTLY NOT VERY SWEET.
but YOU KNOW WHAT IS?
revenge.
we HEAR IT'S BEST SERVED COLD.
who's HUNGRY?
Dorota, I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ANYONE.
Hi, JENNY.
Hi.
what DO YOU WANT?
uh...
I REALIZED THAT I STILL HAVE YOUR CALLIGRAPHY PENS
from THE PARTY INVITATIONS,
and THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED THEM FOR SOMETHING.
that IS THE LAMEST EXCUSE I'VE EVER HEARD.
you WANNA KNOW WHAT CHUCK BASS IS SAYING ABOUT YOU.
no.
is HE... SAYING THINGS?
is ANYONE?
Mm... NO.
not YET, ANYWAY.
Chuck LIKES TO BRAG ABOUT HIS CONQUESTS, NOT HIS VICTIMS.
come ON. YOU CAN HELP ME GET READY FOR BRUNCH.
okay. SURE.
nice FLOWERS.
they're HYDRANGEAS.
just COFFEE. I'M NOT STAYING LONG.
this IS BROOKLYN, LIL, NOT THE WARPED TOUR.
and DON'T TELL ME YOU HAD ALL YOUR TATTOOS REMOVED.
I MEAN, EVEN THAT ONE,
that LITTLE HEART-SHAPED ONE BETWEEN YOUR, UH...
uh, DON'T TRY TO BE CUTE, OKAY?
those DAYS ARE WELL BEHIND YOU.
and HERE I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING HANDSOME
so WHAT'S THE BIG EMERGENCY?
Dan WENT OUT WITH SERENA LAST NIGHT.
and US HUMPHREYS SURE ARE PROUD OF HIM.
Hi. CAN I HELP YOU?
two AMERICANOS... ONE WITH AN EXTRA SHOT?
Mm-hmm.
you DON'T ACTUALLY THINK I'M GONNA TELL MY KID WHO HE CAN AND CAN'T DATE.
I MEAN, IS THAT REALLY THE REASON YOU CAME DOWN HERE?
Oh, WELL, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING.
admit IT，YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH ME AGAIN?
you're RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
the BAD V-NECK T-SHIRTS, THE AWFUL JOKES.
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOUR WIFE YOU.
well, SHE'S GOT BETTER TASTE THAN YOU.
here YOU ARE. THANKS.
I MEAN, COME ON. WHY ELSE HAVE I SEEN YOU MORE IN THE LAST 2 DAYS THAN IN THE LAST 15 YEARS?
an UNFORTUNATE TWIST OF FATE.
but FATE NONETHELESS. UNLESS YOU, UH...
are YOU SEEING SOMEONE?
no, NOT REALLY.
Uh-huh, NOT SERIOUS...
or HE'S MARRIED. THAT IS YOUR TYPE.
that's ENOUGH, RUFUS.
what's HIS NAME?
I've READ ABOUT HIM IN "FORBES" OR "ROLLING STONE"?
well, WHOEVER HE IS, I'M SURE HE CAN'T KEEP UP WITH YOU.
well, I'M GONNA TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT,
but I'M SERIOUS. I'M WORRIED ABOUT SERENA.
I DON'T NEED SOME NEW BOY INFLUENCING HER,
distracting HER FROM HER NEEDS.
well, NO OFFENSE, LIL,
but I'M GUESSING A KID LIKE DAN IS EXACTLY WHAT SERENA NEEDS.
so, UH...
what DO YOU NEED TO TALK TO SERENA ABOUT?
nothing, JUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
you?
I...
am NOWHERE NEAR THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
but I'M WORKING ON A BETTER EXCUSE.
you GUYS, LIKE...
Oh, UH...
I... I DON'T KNOW.
Yeah, WELL, THAT'S SERENA.
with HER, YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.
there YOU ARE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
nothing, WAITING FOR YOU.
him?
Hey, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
why, WHAT IS THIS--
actually, IT IS.
Yeah, SO UNLESS YOU HAVE A REASON TO BE HERE,
I'll HAVE TO ASK YOU TO WAIT ON THE CURB WITH THE REST OF THE TRASH.
not THE OZARKS... NO OFFENSE TO THE OZARKS.
but DON'T YOU THINK WE'RE TAKING THIS CLASS WARFARE THING A LITTLE TOO FAR? I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED, MAN.
okay, MAN, LET'S JUST GO.
don't TELL ME YOU'RE STICKING UP FOR SERENA'S NEW BITCH.
if ANYONE'S GOT A REASON TO KICK HIS ASS, IT'S YOU.
he's NOT WORTH IT. NOT HERE.
this ISN'T OVER.
Hey, ANYTIME, MAN.
that ONE BLACK EYE LOOKS A LITTLE LONELY.
come ON, CHILL OUT.
Wow. BLAIR, IT'S... IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
I MEAN, YOU LOOK... BEAUTIFUL.
it's AVERAGE.
the COLOR IS LAST SEASON,
and BESIDES, STELLA MCARTNEY HAS A MUCH BETTER VERSION AT BERGDORF'S.
right. I... I'VE BEEN MEANING TO GO BY BERGDORF'S.
wow, THESE DOLLS ARE GREAT.
Oh, MY GOD. YOU HAVE A CABBAGE PATCH.
my BROTHER USED TO HAVE ONE OF THESE. HIS NAME WAS CEDRIC.
he, UM, HE WENT OUT WITH SERENA LAST NIGHT.
that's YOUR BROTHER?
so DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH SERENA NOW?
I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HER,
but IF SOMEONE DID HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HER,
I WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT EITHER.
you KNOW...
if YOU LIKE THAT DRESS, YOU CAN HAVE IT.
what? NO, NO.
I'm SURE YOU'LL FIND SOME WAY TO REPAY ME.
Oh, BLAIR, THANK YOU.
I MEAN, FOR THE DRESS AND...
for THE OTHER THING ABOUT, UH, ABOUT CHUCK.
if YOU WANT TO BE PART OF THIS WORLD, JENNY,
people WILL TALK...
eventually,
and YOU NEED TO DECIDE IF ALL THIS IS WORTH IT.
Dan. HEY.
I-I-I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD...
uh, GIVE OR TAKE 70 BLOCKS.
um, I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU IN PERSON
that, UH, THE END OF LAST NIGHT
may HAVE NOT BEEN MY FINEST HOUR.
there WAS A, UH, A WAVE.
I-I-I SAW THAT, YEAH.
Yeah, YEAH, AND SINCE THEN,
I've JUST BEEN WONDERING, UH...
are YOU HUNGRY?
Yes.
actually, I'VE HAD A WORST MORNIG
well, YOU--YOU WANNA-- YOU WANNA TALK?
and EAT? NOT NECESSARILY IN THAT ORDER.
Yes, I WOULD LOVE TO DO BOTH,
but FOOD FIRST, BECAUSE I'M STARVING.
great.
mom.
ms. VAN DER WOODSEN.
Dan... STILL HERE.
look, MOM, I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR ME TO GO TO THAT BRUNCH.
you PROMISED.
Yeah, BUT THAT WAS BEFORE I KNEW DAN WAS HUNGRY, TOO.
I CAN'T LET THE BOY STARVE.
it WOULD BE INHUMANE.
he's NOT INVITED.
Yeah, THAT'S WHY I'M GOING WITH HIM.
because I CAN'T GO WITH HER.
and WE HAVE PLANS TO GO TO BRUNCH TOGETH
we HAD THOSE PLANS.
Serena, YOU'RE HOME,
living UNDER MY ROOF, MY RULES.
what IS IT GONNA TAKE TO GET YOU DRESSED
and THROUGH THAT DOOR?
uh, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAY-- MAYBE THIS WAS A-A BAD IDEA.
you've GOT TO BE KIDDING.
Yeah, THIS WAS--THIS WAS DEFINITELY A BAD IDEA.
this SHOULD BE FUN.
looks LIKE CHUCK AND BLAIR SHOWED UP WITH QUITE AN APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION, THAT IS.
Hey, DAD, HOW'S THE NEW SONG GOING?
Oh, I THINK I NEED MORE COFFEE.
whatever WORKS.
Where'd YOU GET THE DRESS?
for DOING THE PARTY INVITATIONS.
Oh, AND IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY EXPENSIVE GIFT.
dad, SHE HAS A CLOSET THE SIZE OF THIS APARTMENT
just FULL OF THEM. SEE, HER MOM DESIGNED IT.
and HER MOM MUST BE VERY CAPABLE.
but THE DRESS YOU MADE FOR YOURSELF IS MUCH NICER.
which IS WHY YOU DO NOT DRESS?
uh, ONE OF A COUPLE OF REASONS.
Hey, YOU THINK THE FARMERS MARKET'S STILL OPEN?
Yeah. WHY, YOU WANNA GO? YEAH.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GETTING TOO OLD TO GO PLACES WITH YOUR DAD.
well, YOU USED TO BE COOL,
and THE '90S ARE HAVING A COMEBACK.
you HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THAT HURTS.
well, I CAN'T SAY MUCH FOR HIS CHILD-REARING SKILLS,
but BART BASS KNOWS BRUNCH.
um, I, UH, I-I NEED TO USE THE LADIES ROOM.
uh, YOU THINK YOU'LL BE OKAY BY YOURSELF FOR A WHILE?
Yeah. COME ON. ME AND, UH, SOME BELUGA CAVIAR CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE STUFF.
okay.
great.
Hey, HOW'S IT GOING?
no, YOU'RE--YOU'RE OKAY.
Yeah, JUST, UH, GO AHEAD AND DO YOUR THING.
would YOU EXCUSE ME?
father.
the, UH, THE INVITATION SAID "BLACK TIE," NOT "BLACK EYE.
are YOU OKAY?
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE...
only OF MY OWN MAKING.
why DO YOU THINK I DO ALL THIS, HUH?
this PARTY IS FOR YOU, OKAY?
so YOU CAN MEET PEOPLE,
you KNOW, BECOME A PART OF SOMETHING,
make SOME KIND OF CHANGE.
Really?
I THOUGHT IT WAS ANOTHER EXCUSE FOR AN OPEN BAR
and, UH, REHIRING OF THE NEARLY NUDE STATUES.
do ME A FAVOR, WILL YOU?
lose THE SCOTCH. IT'S BARELY NOON.
Serena, I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
actually, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, WHICH MEANS YOU CAN LISTEN.
Nate, YOU TOLD BLAIR. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
look, I WANT TO EXPLAIN. EXCUSE ME.
sorry.
we CAN'T TALK HERE.
what, WHERE BLAIR MIGHT SEE US?
meet ME IN CHUCK'S SUITE.
I'm NOT SNEAKING AROUND WITH YOU.
please. JUST TO TALK.
ten MINUTES.
I'll MEET YOU UP THERE.
you LOOK BEAUTIFUL, AS ALWAYS.
Where's YOUR LOVELY MOTHER TODAY?
Paris. MUST BE SOME DRAMA AT THE ATELIER.
Oh, NOTHING TOO DRAMATIC, I HOPE.
her LINE IS DOING VERY WELL.
I WAS JUST TELLING MY FIRM WHAT A GREAT INVESTMENT SHE'D MAKE.
she's REALLY GOING PLACES.
hopefully PLACES FAR, FAR AWAY.
just KIDDING.
Hey. LET ME GET YOU A REFILL. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I'll GO WITH YOU. EXCUSE US.
Blair SEEMS HAPPY. IT LOOKS LIKE, UH,
you're TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS, AS DISCUSSED.
dad, NOT EVERYTHING IN LIFE'S A BUSINESS DEAL.
come TALK TO ME IN THIRTY YEARS.
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO TIMOTHY. GOOD. HI.
his FIRM HAS GOT SOME REALLY INTERESTING SUMMER INTERNSHIPS. NICE TO MEET YOU.
I CAN'T BELIEVE SERENA CAME TO THIS BRUNCH.
I TOLD HER TO STAY AWAY.
you WORRIED ABOUT NATE?
I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET HIS ATTENTION.
and WHAT'S THAT? THE KEY TO MY SUITE,
Nate's HEART AND YOUR FUTURE HAPPINESS.
I'm HONORED TO BE PLAYING EVEN A SMALL ROLE IN YOUR DEFLOWERING.
you're DISGUSTING. YES, I AM, SO WHY BE SHY?
just GRAB NATE AND FINISH THIS.
report BACK WITH DETAILS.
nice TO MEET YOU. DAD.
what ARE YOU DOING RIGHT NOW?
uh, WELL, I WAS JUST GONNA
how ABOUT ME? UM...
what, YOU HAVE A BETTER OFFER OR...
no, OF COURSE NOT. YEAH?
uh, NOW?
now. NOW.
Mmm. WHERE ARE WE GOING?
I GOT US THE BEST ROOM IN THE WHOLE PLACE.
wait, THIS IS CHUCK'S SUITE. NATE.
SPOTTED--NATE AND BLAIR.
hot AND HEAVY IN THE HALLS OF THE PALACE HOTEL, ONLY TO FIND SERENA ALREADY WAITING.
sparks WERE FLYING FOR SURE, BUT WILL IT BE A 3-WAY OR D-DAY?
is SHE DOING HERE? I WAS MEETING NATE.
just TO TALK, I SWEAR.
you SAID YOU'D NEVER SPEAK TO HER AGAIN.
you SAID THAT? WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
because YOU CAN'T BE TRUSTED.
it's NOT SERENA'S FAULT. DO NOT DEFEND HER.
I ASKED HER TO COME.
Oh. OH, SO YOU DO WANT TO TALK TO HER.
Yes, TO EXPLAIN WHY I'M NOT TALKING TO HER.
maybe I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO TO FINISH THAT FASCINATING CONVERSATION.
Oh, NO, NO. I'LL GO. LET YOU GUYS GET BACK TO YOUR QUICKIE.
it WASN'T A QUICKIE.
sex IS ACTUALLY KIND OF A BIG DEAL TO SOME OF US.
Oh, YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT. CHUCK'S BED? VERY ROMANTIC.
classy, TOO.
Oh, LIKE YOU?
I'll BET YOUR NEW FRIEND DAN WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ALL ABOUT HOW CLASSY YOU ARE.
what, YOU REALLY THINK SHE WOULD TELL HIM?
it's BLAIR.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TOLD HER.
you JUST EXPECTED ME TO KEEP IT A SECRET?
Yes, NATE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH KEEPING A SECRET
if THE TRUTH IS GONNA HURT SOMEONE. THAT'S A HELL OF A WAY
Oh, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T REALIZE ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE THE MOST HONEST GUY ON THE PLANET.
well, IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT DOESN'T WANT TO BE SEEN TOGETHER IN PUBLIC
no, I DO WANT.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU WITH ANYONE ELSE.
tell YOUR HAREM OF SHOPGIRLS AND MODELS
that YOU'RE SEEING SOMEONE.
I AM, BUT THOSE CONVERSATIONS TAKE A LITTLE TIME.
well, THEY'VE GOT NOTHING BUT TIME, BART. THEY'RE 25.
excuse ME.
Dan, WAIT.
look, I REALLY DON'T APPRECIATE YOUR LURKING IN THE SHADOWS,
eavesdropping ON MY PRIVATE CONVERSATION.
what? NO. NO, NO, I WASN'T. I WAS LOOKING FOR SERENA.
well, I DON'T SEE HER. DO YOU?
no, WHICH IS WHY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE
or WHAT YOU THINK YOU HEARD...
nothing. I HEARD NOTHING.
but SERENA DOESN'T KNOW.
and NEITHER DO I, OKAY?
so NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M GONNA GO BACK INSIDE,
not TELL ANYONE A THING AND MIND MY OWN BUSINESS.
Hi. I'M BLAIR WALDORF, SERENA'S FRIEND.
Oh, HEY. YEAH, UH, DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE SHE IS?
as A MATTER OF FACT, I DO. BLAIR.
Serena, THERE YOU ARE.
uh, WHERE WERE YOU? SHE WAS WAITING IN A HOTEL ROOM TO TALK. ABOUT WHY WE WEREN'T TALKING.
that DOESN'T SOUND ANY SMARTER THE SECOND TIME.
why WEREN'T YOU TALKING?
does THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHY YOU WERE WAITING FOR SERENA THIS MORNING?
you WERE WHAT?
and HERE I THOUGHT YOU WERE WAITING FOR ME.
Oh, EXACTLY WHAT
now WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? WE WERE JUST GETTING INTO THAT.
Blair, PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS.
sorry. OH, DO YOU WANNA TELL HIM?
I'll TELL HIM. YOU KNOW?
I KNOW EVERYTHING. AND APPARENTLY, I KNOW NOTHING.
look, DAN, IT--IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, AND I REGRET IT.
look, SERENA,
stop TRYING TO PRETEND YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL.
so YOU SLEPT WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND'S BOYFRIEND.
I KIND OF ADMIRE YOU FOR IT.
is THAT TRUE?
well, THEN SHE RAN AWAY AND LIED ABOUT IT.
I JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE YOU FALL HEAD OVER HEELS FOR YOUR PERFECT GIRL AND HER PERFECT WORLD,
and THEN GET LEFT ALL ALONE
with NO ONE BUT YOUR CABBAGE PATCH KID.
cabbage PATCH?
did YOU TALK TO MY SISTER? AH, YES, LITTLE JENNY.
I DO BELIEVE SHE AND I HAVE SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS.
you STAY AWAY FROM HER.
poor DANIEL. SO LITTLE TIME, SO MANY SLUTS TO DEFEND.
it's FINE. IT'S FINE. EVERYONE CAN STOP LOOKING.
he's A JERK...
but IT'S MY FAULT, AND--AND I'M LEAVING.
I--I'll GO WITH YOU.
actually, I'D PREFER IF YOU DIDN'T.
hope YOU'RE HAPPY.
not EVEN CLOSE.
looks LIKE IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.
apparently, MY ROOM IS AVAILABLE.
some MIGHT CALL THIS A "FUSTERCLUCK,
but ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE, WE CALL IT SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
Dan, WAIT. I'M SO SORRY.
there's NO-- THERE'S NO NEED TO BE.
really, I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE TODAY. I MADE A MISTAKE.
no, YOU DIDN'T. LOOK, I'M SORRY ABOUT BLAIR AND CHUCK
it's NOT ABOUT BLAIR OR CHUCK.
I MEAN, IT IS, BUT IT'S--IT'S NOT JUST THEM.
no, I KNOW. TRUST ME, I KNOW. THIS WORLD--IT--IT'S CRAZY.
Yeah, IT--IT IS...
and YOU'RE A PART OF IT.
what, AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?
I DON'T KNOW. I-I THOUGHT YOU WERE DIFFERENT.
well, I'M SORRY I'M NOT WHO YOU THOUGHT I WAS,
but WHAT'S HAPPENED IS IN THE PAST,
you KNOW, AND ALL I CAN DO IS TRY TO CHANGE.
but IF YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THAT,
then, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT WHO I THOUGHT YOU WERE.
well, I GUESS WE BOTH MADE MISTAKES.
Hi. HEY, JEN SAID YOU WENT LOOKING FOR SERENA.
did YOU FIND HER?
Mm. YEAH, YEAH, I FOUND HER, AND, UH, AND THEN I LOST HER.
Oh, UH, THAT'S, UH...
it's FINE. IT'S FINE. REALLY, IT'S ALL FOR THE BEST.
Serena AND HER FRIENDS AND HER FAMILY...
her WHOLE WORLD...
turns OUT IT WASN'T FOR ME.
wait, DAN. WHAT HAPPENED?
did YOU TELL BLAIR WALDORF ABOUT CEDRIC?
I...
it MAY HAVE COME UP.
you CAN'T TRUST THESE PEOPLE, JEN.
don't TELL 'EM ANYTHING.
they're NICE FLOWERS.
they're HYDRANGEAS.
look, BLAIR,
either YOU TRY TO FORGIVE ME AND MOVE ON...
or WE END IT.
well, SERENA'S MYSTERY MAN IS A MYSTERY NO LONGER.
his NAME IS... OH, WHO CARES?
now THAT HE AND SERENA ARE OVER, SO ARE HIS 15 MINUTES.
but HIS SISTER JENNY WAS SPOTTED WITH A NEW DRESS GIFTED FROM BLAIR HERSELF.
everyone KNOWS AN ELEANOR ORIGINAL IS THE UNIFORM OF BLAIR'S PRIVATE ARMY.
but WILL JENNY BE A LOYAL SOLDIER OR WILL SHE SIDE WITH SERENA'S REBEL FORCES?
and AS FOR SERENA HERSELF, WE HEAR THAT SHE LEFT TODAY'S BRUNCH WITH NOFRIENDS, NO BOY AND NOWHERE LEFT TO RUN.
it LOOKS LIKE THE ULTIMATE INSIDER HAS BECOME A TOTAL OUTSIDER.
it's YOUR MOVE, SERENA, AND YOU KNOW WHO WILL BE WATCHING
gossip GIRL.
gossip girl here
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
top story on my home page:
Serena Van Der Woodsen, everybody's favorite "it" girl, has just returned from a mysterious absence.
you'll never believe what's on "gossip girl."
someone saw Serena getting offa train at grand cen al.
everyone knows Serena...and everyone is talking.
Blair, it's Serena.
and B.'S boyfriend Nate-- rumor has it-- he's always had a thing for serena.
but you're back now. - I didn't come back for you.
look, Blair's my best friend, and you're her boyfriend, and she loves you.
why did she leave? Why did she return?
must be a lot of rumors why you're back.
Yeah, but none of them mention you.
he tries to take his own life, and you're worried it's gonna cost you, mom?
you have no idea what it's been like.
the best friend and the boyfriend-- that's pretty classy, S.
and Nate's friend Chuck won't let Serena forget about her past.
I'm trying to change.
I liked you better before.
and then there's Dan, the outsider. Looks like his childhood crush has returned.
she doesn't know me. Nobody knows me. It's cool.
uh, Serena, - No. No, no, no, no, no.
um, do you know this young man?
Oh, from last night.
you remember me?
you'd really go outwith some guy you don't know?
well, he can't be worse than the guys I do know.
guess whose dad is cool. - It's a trick question.
yeah,'cause it can't be ours.
top ten forgotten bands of the '90s.
Yeah, check out who's number nine.
he's very proud.
Hey! Hey, way to be forgotten.
why is my daughter going to one of your concerts?
well, our kids were bound to meet. It's a small island.
are you sure it's not some ploy, your using my daughter to get to me now that your wife left you?
Serena and her mystery man made a surprise appearance at Blair's kiss on the lips party.
Serena's here?
what is she doing here? She wasn't invited.
but Serena wasn't the only one who made an impression...
who's the newbie?
Jenny made an impression on Chuck.
let's go and talk somewhere quieter.
get off! Stop! - Hey!
that is my little sister!
don't you ever touch her again!
Hey, your life is over, slut!
she better not show her face again.
I'm actually hoping she will.
you think I got a shot at a second date?
we'll talk about it in the cab.
and now that S. is back, will the upper east side ever be the same?
we're all just dying to see what happens next.
I bet you're wondering what gossip girl is doing up so early.
truth is, I never went to bed.
why waste precious time dreaming when waking life is so much better?
I ain't looking is there really anything better than a lazy sunday?
reading the paper in bed, sipping coff , scrambling an egg or two.
Yeah, right. We upper east siders don't do lazy.
breakfast is brunch, and it comes with champagne, a dress code and a hundred of our closest friends...and enemies.
Chuck's dad, Bart Bass, is hosting the annual brunch for his foundation.
everyone is invited.
well, not everyone.
Hey, you're up.
and you're checking up on me.
I'm okay. Really, I'm okay.
you know, I was okay when you asked me at the party and in the cab, when we got home, before and after I brushed my teeth.
look, I just feel really stupid.
I mean, how could I have actually thought that Chuck Bass just wanted to talk to me?
because you trust people, which is normally a good thing.
Yeah, except when it involves Chuck.
Yeah, pretty much.
so the real question is, uh, how are you?
me?
why wouldn't I be okay?
you know, at the end of the night, with Serena and the--the--the...
was it really that bad?
this is me.
So...good night. - Yeah. yeah.
um, yeah, good night.
go! Walk her to the door. Something. Go!
OK.
whoa, whoa, stop, stop. Sir, stop, stop, stop.
Oh, I think I have brain damage.
you know what, Dan? If you had brain damage, you wouldn't even know if you had brain damage.
no, let's go, please. Uh, Wi--Williamsburg.
No!
h-hi.
so he waved?
I wouldn't have taken him for a waver.
no, he was just trying to be funny.
maybe he's shy.
or he hates me.
no guy in the history of the world has ever hated you.
she probably thinks I hate her now.
I've waited my entire adolescent life for a date with this girl, you know, Serena Van Der Woodsen...
and I decide to close the evening with a wave.
it was a nice wave. - At the end of a date?
come on, there's no such thing.
and you only get one shot with a girl like Serena.
I got mine, and I blew it.
which means you have nothing to lose.
no, nothing except my last shred of dignity.
Oh, no. I think that's gone.
you're right.
you know what? I'm just-- I'm gonna go talk to her.
I'm gonna apologize for the wave.
I'm gonna tell her how much I like her, and I'm gonna ask for a second shot.
no, I'm gonna get a second shot.
Yeah, you are. - Yeah.
wait, wait, wait.
I love the plan, but, uh, you need a better outfit.
and maybe a shower.
whatever. It's probably for the best.
the last thing I need in my life is a new guy.
he was just so smart, though, and--and funny...
it sounds like you like him.
and really nice.
God, Blair was so mean to me last night.
I don't even know why. Whatever. I'm sure if we talk about it, we can work it out.
Hey, maybe I should go over there.
Serena had better just stay away.
- Thank you, dorota. - Yeah, thanks.
we love sleeping at Blair's.
I don't want to see serena at school, and she better not show at brunch today.
you're really mad at serena.
Yeah, I hope you never get that mad at us.
well, you would never do what serena did.
no, never. - Of course not.
I wonder if Nate remembered brunch.
it would be so wrong for me to show up without my boyfriend whom I love, and who loves me.
Hello? - Hi, sweetie.
did I wake you? - No, I'm up.
well, get some strong coffee and jump in the shower, sleepyhead.
Chuck's dad's brunch for his foundation is today at the palace.
Oh, right. Of course.
Nathaniel, keep it down.
some of us are tryingto regain our strength.
your dad's brunch is today. - Alarm's set for 9: 00.
it's 10: 00.
ladies, double-time.
Oh, unless...nathaniel...
I'm good.
actually, could you two bring some coffee when you get a chance?
and some water...lots of water.
you want ice with that?
looks like you could use some.
that's enough, ladies.
and I'll be sureto tell my father just how committed you are to the hospitality industry.
that kid popped you pretty good, huh?
never mess with a guy's sister.
and if I knew his name, I'd hunt him down and kill him.
why, 'cause you kill people now?
you gonna strangle himwith your scarf?
don't mock the scarf, nathaniel. It's my signature.
I'm just saying, death by scarf--not that intimidating.
he sucker punched me. I told you.
besides, better a broken nose than a broken heart.
what? I didn't even talkto Serena last night.
who said anything about Serena?
do I look okay?
definitely second-shot material.
all right, then I'm gonna go.
Oh, um, and about what happened, you know, with, uh, Chuck?
if you wanna, like, talk to someone...
n-not your brother--just let me know.
okay. - Yeah, I'll...all right.
Hey, uh, wait.
actually, there is someone I wanna talk to.
Hey, hey, where you guys going?
I was gonna make waffles.
sorry, dad. - Yeah, can't.
but I wanna hear about your date.
later.
and your party. - When we get back.
you guys missed a really great show, and I make really good waffles.
palace hotel lobby.
Hi. This is, uh, Nate Archibald calling from the Bass suite.
I know you don't normally give out this information, but can you tell me what room the Van Der Woodsens are in, please?
Hey, Blair. It's me.
uh, I guess you're still sleeping, but I'm gonna come over.
I think we need to talk.
okay. Uh, see you soon. Bye.
it looks the table's all set.
as soon as the guests arrive, we can start dishing.
here's what's on the menu...
mom, did you borrow my michel perrys?
I can't find anything in here!
well, it might help if you unpacked.
look, you're home now. It's your life. You should start living it.
this is not life, this is a hotel which we're living in because you decided you didn't like the color of the walls in our real home.
mom, I said I'd go to this brunch. What more do you want from me?
sweetie, why are youbeing like this?
you love parties. This is just not like you.
maybe it is like me. Maybe you don't know what I'm really like.
OK so did you and Dan have fun at the concert last night?
we, um, never made it.
we actually ended up at the kiss on the lips party.
well, that must have pleased Blair.
Blair? Actually, no, not that pleased, which is why I'm going to talk to her.
well just be back in time for brunch, okay?
mom.
look, honey, I know how hard it is for you to be back, but the more you hide yourself away, the more people are gonna think you have something to hide.
coming from someone who's keeping my brother in an institution.
that's different.
I mean it. Don't be late.
wait! Thanks.
Hey.
how you doing?
uh, I-I was in yesterday with Serena.
how could I forget?
Yeah, well, um, is she in?
just missed her, actually, but you're welcome to wait.
okay, maybe I will. She--she probably won't be that long, right?
once she went out and didn't come back for six months, but feel free to sit.
over there.
over there is where I'll be.
Hi, Nate. It's great to see you.
Hi, Mrs. Van Der Woodsen. Good to see you.
Oh, I'm just heading out.
Oh, is Serena in?
Oh, you just missed her, but I'll tell her you came by.
I'm sure she'll be happy to hear it.
uh, I don't know about that.
Oh, what? Come on, Serena loves you.
I mean, I think she's always had a little crush on you.
of course, you and Blair are the perfect couple.
is Serena gonna be long? I could just wait.
Oh, well, Dexter Herecan take care of you. I'm just gonna step out for a while.
Nate's gonna wait for Serena. - Great.
he can get in line behind that guy.
I had a feeling you'd be back.
Dan, is it? - Humphrey. Yes.
it's nice to see you again, Mrs. Van Der Woodsen.
I hope you've had a pleasant, uh...uh, 21 hours since I last saw you.
Yes, it has been very pleasant...
until now.
gentlemen.
Hey. - Hey.
Hey.
Hey, I got two bone-dry caps and audrey.
I must have totally blanked on the part where I invited you over.
I-I called you.
Blair, it's sunday morning.
coffee, croissants,"breakfast at tiffany'S." It's our tradition.
I have new traditions now.
well, they're not traditions if they're new.
look, blair, I'm really trying to make an effort here.
I thought everything was good between us.
it was...
before I found out you had sex with my boyfriend.
how'd you find out?
Nate told me.
at least he felt he owed it to me to tell the truth.
I don't know what to say. - Don't bother saying anything.
I wouldn't believe you anyway.
Blair, it was...
you know...
I always knew you were a whore.
I never took you for a liar, too.
Blair, how can I fix this?
you don't, serena.
you just stay awayfrom me, my boyfriend and my friends.
you're done here.
Serena's visit was short and apparently not very sweet.
but you know what is?
revenge.
we hear it's best served cold.
who's hungry?
Dorota, I told youI didn't want to see anyone.
Hi, jenny. - Hi.
what do you want?
I realized that I still have your calligraphy pens from the party invitations, and thought you might need them for something.
that is the lamest excuseI've ever heard.
you wanna know what Chuck Bass is saying about you.
no.
is he... saying things? Is anyone?
no. Not yet, anyway.
Chuck likes to brag about his conquests, not his victims.
come on. You can help me get ready for brunch.
okay. Sure.
nice flowers. - They're hydrangeas.
just coffee. I'm not staying long.
I'd like to get out of here before someone throws me down and tattoos me.
this is brooklyn, lil, not the warped tour.
and don't tell me you had all your tattoos removed.
I mean, even that one, that little heart-shaped one between your, uh...
uh, don't try to be cute, okay?
those days are well behind you.
and here I thought I was getting better-looking every day.
so what's the big emergency?
Dan went out with Serena last night.
and us Humphreys sure are proud of him.
well, currently, he's sitting in the lobby of the hotel where we're living.
Hi. Can I help you?
two americanos...
one with an extra shot?
you don't actually think I'm gonna tell my kid who he can and can't date.
I mean, is that really the reason you came down here?
Oh, well, I know what you're implying.
admit it. You're falling for me again.
you're right, you're right.
it's the low-income tax bracket, the bad v-neck t-shirts, the awful jokes.
well, she's got better taste than you.
here you are. Thanks.
I mean, come on.
why else have I seen you more in the last 2 days than in the last 15 years?
an unfortunate twist of fate.
but fate nonetheless. Unless you, uh...
are you seeing someone?
no, not really.
not serious...
or he's married. That is your type.
that's enough, Rufus.
what's his name? I've read about him in "forbes" or "rolling stone"?
well, whoever he is, I'm sure he can't keep up with you.
well, I'm gonna take thatas a compliment, but I'm serious. I'm worried about Serena.
I don't need some new boy influencing her, distracting her from her needs.
well, no offense, lil, but I'm guessing a kid like Danis exactly what Serena needs.
so, uh...
what do you needto talk to Serena about?
nothing, just in the neighborhood.
you? - I...am nowhere near the neighborhood, but I'm working on a better excuse.
you guys, like...
I...I don't know.
Yeah, well, that's Serena.
with her, you'll never know.
there you are. What are you doing?
nothing, waiting for you.
him?
Hey, what are you doing here?
why, what is this--uh, your hotel?
actually, it is.
Yeah, so unless you have a reason to be here,
I'll have to ask you to wait on the curb with the rest of the trash.
trash?
look, man, I live in brooklyn, all right?
not the Ozarks...no offense to the Ozarks.
but don't you think we're taking this class warfare thing a little too far?
I haven't even started, man.
okay, man, let's just go.
don't tell me you're sticking up for Serena's new bitch.
if anyone's got a reas onto kick his ass, it's you.
he's not worth it. Not here.
this isn't over.
Hey, anytime, man. That one black eyelooks a little lonely.
come on, chill out.
Blair, it's...it's beautiful.
I mean, you look...
beautiful.
it's average.
the color is last season, and besides, Stella Mccartney has a much better version at Bergdorf's.
right. I...
I've been meaning to go by Bergdorf's.
wow, these dolls are great.
Oh, my god. You have a cabbage patch.
my brother used to have one of these. His name was cedric.
your brother's name is cedric?
uh, no, that was his cabbage patch kid.
my brother's name is Dan. Actually, you might know him.
he, um, he went out with Serena last night.
that's your brother?
so does that mean you're friends with Serena now?
I mean, I don't have a problem with her, but if someone did have a problem with her, I wouldn't have a problem with that either.
you know...
if you like that dress, you can have it.
what? No, no.
I'm sure you'll find some way to repay me.
Oh, Blair, thank you. I mean, for the dress and...
for the other thing about, uh, about chuck.
if you want to be part of this world, Jenny, people will talk...
eventually, and you need to decideif all this is worth it.
Dan. hey.
I-I-I was in the neighborhood...
uh, give or take 70 blocks.
I just wanted to tell you in person that, uh, the end of last night may have not been my finest hour.
there was a, uh, a wave.
I-I-I saw that.
Yeah, yeah, and since then, I've just been wondering, uh...
are you hungry?
Yes. Actually, I've had the worst morning.
well, you--you wanna--you wanna talk? And eat?
not necessarily in that order.
Yes, I would love to do both, but food first, because I'm starving.
great. Just in time for brunch.
mom.
ms. Van Der Woodsen.
Dan...still here.
look, mom, I really don't think it's a good idea for me to go to that brunch.
you promised.
Yeah, but that was bef-- before I knew Dan was hungry, too.
I can't let the boy starve.
it would be inhumane.
he's not invited.
Yeah, that's why I'm going with him.
because I can't go with her.
and we have plans to go to brunch together today.
we had those plans.
Serena, you're home, living under my roof, my rules.
what is it gonna taketo get you dressed and through that door?
uh, you know what? May--maybe this was a-a bad idea.
you've got to be kidding.
Yeah, this was--this was definitely a bad idea.
this should be fun.
looks like Chuck and Blair showed up with quite an appetite...
for destruction, that is.
Hey, dad, how's the new song going?
Oh, I thinkI need more coffee.
whatever works.
Where'd you get the dress?
Oh, it was a thank you-gift from Blair for doing the party invitations.
Oh, and it looks like a very expensive thank you-gift.
dad, she has a closet the size of this apartment just full of them.
see, her mom designed it.
and her momis very talented, but the dress you made for yourself i much nicer.
which is why you don't wear dresses.
uh, one of a couple of reasons.
Hey, y - yeah. Why, you wanna go? - Yeah.
I thought you were getting too old to go places with your dad.
well, you used to be cool, and the '90s are having a comeback.
you have no idea how much that hurts.
well, I can't say much for his child-rearing skills, but Bart Bass knows brunch.
I, uh, I-I need to use the ladies room.
uh, you think you'll be okay by yourself for a while?
Yeah. Come on. Me and, uh, some beluga caviar? Can't get enough of the stuff.
okay. - Great.
Hey, how's it going?
no, you're--you're okay. Yeah, just, uh, go ahead and do your thing.
Charles. Would you excuse me?
father.
the, uh, the invitation said "black tie,"not "black eye.'"
are you okay?
I mean, if you're in some kind of trouble...
only of my own making.
why do you think I do all this, huh?
this party is for you, okay?
so you can meet people, you know, become a part of something, make some kind of change.
Really? I thought it was another excuse for an open bar and, uh, researching of the nearly nude statues.
do me a favor, will you?
lose the scotch.
it's barely noon.
Serena, I really need to talk to you.
actually, I need to talk to you, which means you can listen.
Nate, you told Blair. What were you thinking?
look, I want to explain.
excuse me. - Sorry.
we can't talk here.
what, where Blair might see us?
meet me in Chuck's suite.
I'm not sneaking around with you.
please. Just to talk.
ten minutes. - I'll meet you up there.
you look beautiful, as always.
Where's your lovely mother today?
Paris. Must be some drama at the atelier.
Oh, nothing too dramatic, I hope. Her line is doing very well.
I was just telling my firm what a great investment she'd make.
she's really going places.
hopefully places far, far away.
just kidding.
Hey. Let me get you a refill. I'll be right back.
I'll go with you. Excuse us.
Blair seems happy.
it looks like, uh, you're taking care of business, as discussed.
dad, not everything in life's a business deal.
come talk to me in thirty years.
I want to introduce you to Timothy Good.
his firm has got some really interesting summer internships. - Nice to meet you.
I can't believe Serena came to this brunch.
I told her to stay away.
you worried about Nate?
just a shot in the dark.
I think you know what you need to do to get his attention.
and what's that?
the key to my suite, nate's heart and your future happiness.
and bow out gracefully I'm honored to be playing even a small role in your deflowering.
you're disgusting. - Yes, I am, so why be shy?
just grab Nate and finish this.
report back with details.
nice to meet you.
dad.
Hey, can I get you a drink?
what are you doing right now?
uh, well, I was just gonna-- - how about me?
what, you havea better offer or...
no, of course not. - Yeah?
uh, now? - Now. Now.
where are we going?
I got us the best room in the whole place.
wait, this is Chuck's suite.
Spotted--N. and B. hot and heavy in the halls of the palace hotel, only to find S. already waiting.
sparks were flying for sure, but will it be a 3-way or d-day?
what is she doing here?
I was meeting Nate.
just to talk, I swear.
you said you'd never speak to her again.
you said that? Why would you say that?
because you can't be trusted.
it's not Serena's fault.
do not defend her. - I asked her to come.
Oh, so you do want to talk to her.
Yes, to explain why I'm not talking to her.
maybe I'll leave you two to finish that fascinating conversation.
Oh, no, no. I'll go. Let you guys get back to your quickie.
it wasn't a quickie.
sex is actually kind of a big deal to some of us.
Oh, yeah, I can see that. Chuck's bed? Very romantic. Classy, too.
Oh, like you?
I'll bet your new friend Dan would love to hear all about how classy you are.
What...what, you really think she would tell him?
it's Blair.
I can't believe you told her.
you just expected. - Yes, nate.
there's nothing wron gwith keeping a secret if the truth is gonna hurt someone.
that's a hell of a way to look at things.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn'realize all of a sudden you're the most honest guy on the planet.
well well, it just seems to me that you're the one that doesn't want to be seen together in public.
no, I do want to be seen together.
I just don't want to see you with anyone else.
tell your harem of shopgirls and models that you're seeing someone.
I am, but those conversations take a little time.
well, they've got nothingbut time, Bart. They're 25.
excuse me.
Dan, wait.
look, I really don't appreciate your lurking in the shadows, dropping on my private conversation.
what? No. No, no, I wasn't. I was looking for Serena.
well, I don't see her. Do you?
no, which is why I was looking.
I don't kno what you're doing here or what you think you heard...
nothing. I heard nothing.
but Serena doesn't know.
and neither do I, okay?
so now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go back inside, not tell anyone a thing and mind my own business.
Dan. Hi.
I'm Blair Waldorf, Serena's friend.
Oh, hey.
Yeah, uh, do you happen to know where she is?
as a matter of fact, I do.
Serena, there you are.
uh, where were you?
she was waiting in a hotel room for my boyfriend.
to talk. - About why we weren't talking.
that doesn't sound any smarter the second time.
why weren't you talking?
does this have anything to do with why you were waiting for serena this morning?
you were what?
and here I thought you were waiting for me.
Oh, exactly what the situation needs-- Chuck.
now what is going on here?
we were just getting into that.
Blair, please, don't do this.
sorry. Oh, do you wanna tell him?
I'll tell him.
you know? - I know everything.
and apparently, I know nothing.
look, Dan, it--it was a long time ago, and I regret it.
look, Serena, stop trying to pretend you're a good girl.
so you slept with your best friend's boyfriend.
I kind of admire you for it.
is that true?
well, then she ran awayed and lie about it.
I just thought you should know before you fall head over heels for your perfect girland her perfect world, and then get left all alone with no one but your cabbage patch kid.
cabbage patch?
did you talk to my sister?
Ah, yes, little Jenny.
I do believe she and I have some unfinished business.
you stay away from her. - Poor Daniel.
so little time, so many sluts to defend.
it's fine. It's fine. Everyone can stop looking.
he's a jerk...
but it's my fault, and--and I'm leaving.
I--I'll go with you.
actually, I'd prefer if you didn't.
hope you're happy.
not even close.
looks like it's just you and me.
apparently, my room is available.
some might call this a "fuster cluck,"
but on the upper east side, we call it sunday afternoon.
Dan! Dan, wait. I'm so sorry.
there's no--there's no need to be. Really, I shouldn't have come here today.
I made a mistake. - No, you didn't.
look, I'm sorry about Blair and Chuck.
it's not about Blair or Chuck.
I mean, it is, but it's--it's not just them.
no, I know. Trust me, I know. This world--it--it's crazy.
Yeah, it--it is...
and you're a part of it.
what, and you didn't know that?
I don't know. I-I thought you were different.
well, I'm sorry I'm not who you thought I was, but what's happened is in the past, you know, and all I can do is try to change.
but if you can't accept that, then, you know, you're not who I thought you were.
well, I guess we both made mistakes.
Hi. - Hey, Jen said you went looking for Serena. Did you find her?
Yeah, yeah, I found her, and, uh, and then I lost her.
Oh, uh, that's, uh...
it's fine. It's fine. Really, it's all for the best.
Serena and her friends and her family...
her whole world...
turns out it wasn't for me.
wait, Dan. What happened?
did you tell Blair Waldorf about Cedric?
I...
it may have come up.
you can't trust these people,Jen.
don't tell 'em anything.
they're nice flowers.
they're hydrangeas.
look, Blair, either you try to forgive me and move on...
or we end it.
well, Serena's mystery man is a mystery no longer.
his name is...
Oh, who cares?
now that he and S. are over, so are his 15 minutes.
but his sister Jenny was spotted with a new dress...
gifted from Blair herself.
everyone knows an Eleanor original is the uniform of B.'s private army.
but will J. be a loyal soldier or will she side with S.'s rebel forces?
and as for S. Herself, we hear that she left today's brunch with no friends, no boy and nowhere left to run.
it looks like the ultimate insider has become a total outsider.
it's your move, Serena, and you know who will be watching gossip girl.
gossip GIRL HERE--YOUR ONE AND ONLY SOURCE INTO THE SCANDALOUS LIVES OF MANHATTAN'S ELITE. YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE WHAT'S ON "GOSSIP GIRL.
long AGO, WHEN EUROPEAN ROYALS GREW BORED WITH PALACE BALLS,
they TOOK A PAGE FROM THE PEONS AND ADDED SOME PAGEANTRY.
until YOU ADD A MASK,
but PREPARING FOR A BALL IS AN EVENT IN ITSELF,
which IS WHY QUEENS INVENTED HANDMAIDENS.
so THE DRESSES SHOULD BE DELIVERED,
and I'LL TAKE THE SMALL STUFF WITH ME. WHICH ONE'S YOURS?
Oh, NO. I'M JUST HELPING BLAIR,
but I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE'LL SEE.
well, HERE'S HOPING.
we'll PUT IT ON BLAIR'S TAB. OH, NO, NO, NO.
the GIRLS AT THAT PARTY ARE MY BEST CUSTOMERS.
why NOT SHOW OFF MY LATEST WARES?
just RETURN IT AFTER THE BALL.
so KATI MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT A CUSTOM-MADE CORSET,
and I HEAR THERE ARE WIGS INVOLVED?
it's A MASQUERADE. YOU HAVE TO CONCEAL YOUR IDENTITY,
but I DO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL PLANNED FOR NATE TONIGHT.
it's A GAME. IT'S A SCAVENGER HUNT.
Nate STARTS THE NIGHT WITH A CLUE, WHICH LEADS HIM TO A LADY-IN-WAITING, WHO GIVES HIM A CLUE TO THE NEXT LADY-- WAIT. HOLD ON. YOU HAVE LADIES NOW?
if HE FINDS ME BEFORE MIDNIGHT WHEN THE MASKS COME OFF,
he CAN CLAIM HIS PRIZE. AND WHAT'S THAT?
Oh. YEAH, RIGHT. SORRY.
I JUST FIGURED THAT AFTER EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED,
or HASN'T HAPPENED,
I SHOULD FIND SOME WAY TO MAKE IT SPECIAL.
well, THAT'S REALLY ROMANTIC, BLAIR.
really.
look, UM, IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO COME TONIGHT,
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. I COULD JUST
what? NO, I WANT YOU TO COME.
in FACT, I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD BE ONE OF MY LADIES.
would YOU GIVE NATE THE LAST CLUE?
are YOU SURE YOU WANT ME TO?
tonight IS ALL ABOUT STARTING OVER.
I TRUST YOU... AND HIM.
well, THEN I WILL BE HONORED TO SERVE YOU, MY QUEEN.
well, BESIDES, YOU'RE BRINGING DAN, RIGHT?
a BALL? HAVEN'T YOU HEARD? YOUR SISTER'S CINDERELLA.
and LET ME GUESS. YOUR WICKED STEPSISTER IS BLAIR WALDORF.
Blair MAY HAVE ASKED ME TO DO A FEW THINGS,
but I'M HAPPY TO HELP. AND IF SHE HAPPENS TO HELP YOU OUT WITH AN INVITE AND OUTFIT?
it'll ALL BE WORTH IT. EVERYONE IN DISGUISE IN THIS OLD BALLROOM-- IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING. YOU KNOW,
I'm ACTUALLY SURPRISED SERENA DIDN'T MENTION IT. WHY? WE'VE ONLY BEEN OUT TWICE.
it's NOT LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN,
we HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT, WELL I GOTTA GO DELIVER THIS STUFF.
let ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ME TO PICK YOU UP A TUX.
what? IT'S A MASKED BALL.
I'm SURE SHE THINKS I'D NEVER GO TO SOMETHING THAT PRETENTIOUS,
which SHOWS SHE KNOWS ME WELL. I KNOW HIM. A MASKED BALL?
Dan WOULD NEVER WANT TO GO TO SOMETHING THAT PRETENTIOUS,
where HE HAS TO WEAR A MASK AND A TUX?
he LIKES YOU. HE WOULD WEAR A TUX AND A MASK AND ONE OF MY MOTHER'S DRESSES
if IT MEANT THAT HE COULD GO OUT WITH YOU. COME ON.
what, ARE YOU WORRIED THAT HE ALREADY HAS A DATE?
I MEAN, HE IS DAN HUMPHREY. SHUT UP. I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS A MASKED BALL IS BETTER THAN A REGULAR PARTY
because THEN ALL THOSE KIDS FROM SCHOOL THAT HE HATES
he WON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THEM. ALL RIGHT. INVITE HIM. I INSIST.
I'm NOT SAYING I WOULDN'T GO.
if SERENA ASKED ME, I WOULDN'T DEPRIVE HER OF MY COMPANY.
no, THAT WOULD BE TOO CRUEL.
but SHE HASN'T ASKED ME, SO...
if YOU WANT TO GO WITH HER, JUST MAKE IT HAPPEN.
put YOURSELF OUT THERE. THIS THING HAPPENS IN A MATTER OF HOURS.
is THAT HER?
uh, NO, IT'S VANESSA.
that's BEEN A WHILE.
you GONNA ANSWER THAT? OF COURSE. WHY WOULDN'T I?
Hello? VANESSA.
Hi. YEAH, IT'S ME.
so WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UP? HOW'S VERMONT?
do YOU STILL HAVE MY COPY OF "THE CRYING OF LOT 49"?
um, I DON'T KNOW.
well, COULD YOU CHECK?
okay. I HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOU IN OVER A YEAR,
and YOU CALLED TO ASK ME ABOUT AN OLD BOOK?
you KNOW, IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.
try OVER BY THE WINDOW.
Vanessa. SURPRISE!
what? OH, MY GOD.
how ARE YOU? SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE.
What--what ARE YOU DOING HERE? MY PARENTS SAID I COULD LIVE WITH MY SISTER AND FINISH HIGH SCHOOL IN THE CITY. SO--SO THAT MEANS YOU'RE
I'm BACK FOR GOOD.
that IS...
awesome, I HOPE?
Yeah, T-TOTALLY. YES, OF COURSE.
it's JUST... UNEXPECTED.
unexpectedly AWESOME.
go AHEAD. ANSWER THAT. I'M STARVING, AND I SMELL WAFFLES.
Hi. SERENA, HEY.
Hey. HI.
go AHEAD. DO IT.
uh, HEY, I WAS JUST WONDERING,
are YOU, UH, ARE YOU, UH, DOING ANYTHING TONIGHT?
tonight? NO. NO, NOTHING. WHY?
good, BECAUSE THERE'S THIS THING,
and YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA THINK IT'S STUPID, BUT... TELL ME.
even COLD, THESE ARE SO GOOD.
I-I've MISSED RUFUS' COOKING. I HAVE.
Rufus, DO YOU HAVE WHIPPED CREAM? WHO'S THAT?
uh, IT'S... IT'S MY SISTER,
but YOU--YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING.
Hi, BLAIR. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO WITH THIS STUFF? OH, JUST LEAVE THEM OVER THERE.
that's FINE. I LEFT YOU ANOTHER LIST.
is ANYONE THERE? HELLO?
I'm SORRY. UH... WHAT?
uh, YOU--YOU WERE ASKING ME SOMETHING.
no, UH...
no, NEVER MIND.
thank YOU. HAVE A GOOD DAY. OKAY.
Bye.
so WHAT ARE WE DOING TONIGHT?
I THINK I NEED A DATE.
damn IT, ANNE, I TOLD YOU NO STARCH.
Howard, WE'VE BEEN GOING TO THE SAME CLEANERS FOR 19 YEARS.
your SHIRTS ARE EXACTLY HOW THEY ALWAYS ARE.
we BOTH KNOW THIS ISN'T ABOUT LAUNDRY. I'M SORRY, BUT I NEED EVERYTHING TO BE PERFECT AT ELEANOR'S PARTY TONIGHT.
I CAN'T SCREW UP. ELEANOR KNOWS YOU'RE THE BEST PERSON TO TAKE HER COMPANY PUBLIC. SHE'S GOING TO PICK YOU.
just SHOW UP AND BE YOURSELF.
look, I'M GONNA CALL YOU FROM THE OFFICE.
I GOTTA LOOK OVER THE PROPOSAL AGAIN.
Hey, MOM.
Oh, NATE.
is EVERYTHING OKAY WITH DAD?
just WORK STUFF. NOTHING FOR YOU TO WORRY ABOUT.
sure.
God! I LOVE NEW YORK.
there WAS ONLY ONE THEATER IN WOODBURY,
and ALL IT EVER PLAYED WERE FAMILY MOVIES.
"the PACIFIER" PLAYED FOR, LIKE, A YEAR.
and THEY SAID VIN DIESEL COULDN'T DO COMEDY.
I CAN'T PICK. OVERWHELMED BY CHOICE.
whatever YOU WANT.
Yeah, SURE, WHATEVER. YOU DO WANNA DO SOMETHING, RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU DON'T HAVE PLANS.
big NIGHT OUT WITH OVERPRIVILEGED, UNDER-PARENTED TRUST FUND BRATS FROM YOUR FANCY SCHOOL?
Yeah, THE LIMO'S ACTUALLY WAITING BACK AT THE LOFT.
good. WE CAN EGG IT. MAYBE SLASH THE TIRES?
so IS IT WEIRD, HAVING ME BACK?
no. WHY, UH, WHY-- WHY WOULD IT BE WEIRD?
because WE SAID SOME THINGS THE NIGHT THAT I LEFT
things THAT YOU IMMEDIATELY ASKED ME TO TAKE BACK.
because I WAS LEAVING, BUT... NOW I'M HERE.
Yeah, AND IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR, YOU KNOW?
a LOT HAS HAPPENED, ACTUALLY.
and I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT IT TONIGHT.
late SHOW. ANGELIKA? WHATEVER'S PLAYING?
unless IT'S "THE PACIFIER." UNLESS IT'S "THE PACIFIER."
all RIGHT. I'LL GET TICKETS.
glad TO BE HOME, HUMPHREY.
glad TO HAVE YOU, ABRAMS.
so WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
evidence.
of WHAT?
the CAPTAIN'S DISLIKE OF STARCHY SHIRTS?
I TOTALLY SYMPATHIZE. THE COLLARS CHAFE.
did YOU, UH, ASK HIM ABOUT YOUR MISSING COLLEGE MONEY?
Yeah, HE SAID HE WAS MOVING ACCOUNTS AROUND.
it WAS ALL BACK THE NEXT DAY. SO WHY WORRY? MYSTERIOUS FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS,
warring PARENTS. WELCOME TO THE UPPER EAST SIDE.
chi CHI, GET THE LLELLO. NATHANIEL, I'M SHOCKED.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE STRICTLY AN HERBAL MAN.
this ISN'T MINE.
who DOES THIS DAN HUMPHREY THINK HE IS?
Serena IS PUTTING UP ATRONG FRONT,
but I CAN SEE HOW HURT SHE IS.
we HAVE TO HELP HER HEAL HER HEART. BUT IT'S PRETTY LATE NOTICE.
most OF THE GOOD ONES ARE ALREADY TAKEN. NO MORE EXCUSES. SERENA MUST HAVE THE HOTTEST DATE EVER.
if HE'S GOT PLANS, HE'LL CHANGE THEM.
if HE'S GOT A GIRLFRIEND, HE'LL DUMP HER,
and IF HE'S OUT OF TOWN, HE'LL CHARTER A G5 AND FLY HOME.
make IT HAPPEN.
do YOU LIKE IT? THAT'S OUTSTANDING.
is IT A BONG, MOTHER?
please. I DIDN'T TAKE YOU FOR A STONER.
it's A... A HOOKAH... MM-HMM.
and IT IS ADORABLE. IT'S PERFECT FOR MY MOROCCAN-THEMED PARTY.
why DO YOU HAVE TO CELEBRATE YOUR BENDEL'S DEAL BY TURNING OUR PENTHOUSE INTO AN OPIUM DEN?
why NOT?
Hey, IT'S BLAIR.
I'm sorry I can't come to the phone right now, but I'm getting ready for the masked ball.
see you tonight,if you recognize me,which you won't.
Hey, BLAIR. IT'S ME. I, UM...
I JUST-- I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
it's, UH, THERE'S THIS THING WITH MY DAD,
and, UM...
you KNOW, I JUST-- I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
so CAN YOU CALL ME BACK WHEN YOU CAN? THANKS.
well, THAT'S ALL OF IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE WITHOUT YOU. THANK YOU.
that's OKAY. YEAH, IT WAS FUN.
I'm GLAD. IT'S ALL PART OF YOUR EDUCATION.
and IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE LEARNING. IT'S A NICE BRACELET.
vintage, RIGHT? THE DIAMONDS LOOK REAL.
cause THEY SORT OF ARE.
uh, THE MAN AT THE STORE LENT IT TO ME.
why WOULD HE DO THAT?
Oh! OH, SWEETIE, YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GONNA BE ABLE TO COME TONIGHT, RIGHT?
I THOUGHT MAYBE, YEAH.
Jenny, FRESHMEN DON'T GET TO GO TO THE MASKED BALL.
it's JUST TRADITION. NO, I KNOW. IT'S JUST THAT THERE WERE FIVE DRESSES.
Oh, IT-- YOU ALWAYS NEED BACKUP.
I MEAN, WHAT--WHAT IF I SPILLED SOMETHING OR A ZIPPER BROKE?
Yeah, OF COURSE. I'LL--I'LL REMEMBER THAT.
have FUN TONIGHT.
I WILL, AND DON'T WORRY,
your TIME WILL COME. I PROMISE.
now IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GET READY.
do YOU THINK THAT ELEANOR WALDORF WILL FIND THIS... NIGHT IN TANGIERS ENOUGH?
maybe IF YOU BROUGHT A GOAT.
you KNOW, ELEANOR ALWAYS GOES ALL-OUT. SPEAKING OF GOING ALL-OUT...
Yeah, I KNOW. TELL ME ABOUT IT. I DON'T THINK THE WALDORF WOMEN EVER MET A THEME THEY DIDN'T JUST LOVE.
you GOING WITH DAN?
um, NO, DAN HAS PLANS, ACTUALLY. DOING WHAT?
the QUESTION IS "WITH WHOM"?
Oh, I DIDN'T REALIZE.
well, FRANKLY, I AM RELIEVED.
you KNOW, AT YOUR AGE, YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING THE FIELD.
what ABOUT AT YOUR AGE? YOU GOT A HOT DATE TONIGHT?
what? NO, PLEASE. WHO WOULD I BE DATING?
you KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA GO TRY THIS ON
and SEE IF I CAN FIND A GOAT.
Hi. Serena?
kati Farkas gave me your address.
Yeah. Hi. Who's this?
well, HE'S NO DAN, BUT I GUESS HE'LL DO.
Hey, JEN, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS,
but, UH, VANESSA IS BACK IN TOWN.
so WE'RE GOING TO A MOVIE TONIGHT, AND I DON'T KNOW
if YOU'RE GOING TO THAT BALL OR NOT,
but I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WANTED TO COME WITH.
so, UH, WE'RE GETTING TICKETS ONLINE. CALL ME BACK.
why IS IT THAT FRIENDS OF SERENA VAN DER WOODSEN HELP HER SEARCH FOR HER SUITOR?
have FABLES FALLEN SO OUT OF FASHION THAT THE PRINCESSES HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING THEMSELVES?
call US OLD-SCHOOL,
but SOMETIMES THE FAIRY-TALE ENDING
requires THE KNIGHT TO GET OFF HIS ASS
and SADDLE UP HIS STEED.
So...What are we doing tonight?
maybe IT'S NEVER TOO LATE FOR A BOLD GESTURE.
got a mask?
Nate, HEY.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE? I THOUGHT YOU WERE, UM,
shouldn't YOU BE GETTING READY?
I'm SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. IT'S, UM, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
Yeah, OF COURSE.
come IN.
Thanks.
maybe IT'S OLD. YOU KNOW, LEFT OVER FROM THE '90s OR SOMETHING,
from SOME NIGHT AT LIMELIGHT OR THE TUNNEL?
our PARENTS DID WAY WORSE STUFF THAN WE DO.
it's NOT OLD, AND IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE.
I THINK HE'S HAVING SOME MONEY PROBLEMS.
well, HAVE YOU ASKED HIM ABOUT IT?
Yeah.
I JUST WISH, YOU KNOW, I WISH HE'D BE HONEST WITH ME.
it's LIKE HE AND MY MOM
they MADE SOME SECRET PACT TO ACT LIKE ROBOTS.
Yeah, WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT PACT IS SO SECRET.
I THINK ALL OF OUR PARENTS SIGNED IT. BUT I'M NOT A LITTLE KID ANYMORE.
he DOESN'T HAVE TO SHUT ME OUT.
look, IF WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT,
he's PROBABLY REALLY SCARED.
maybe YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL MORE THAN ONCE
for HIM TO REALLY HEAR YOU, YOU KNOW?
Hey, DON'T GIVE UP, OKAY?
you SHOULD PROBABLY GO.
you KNOW, I'VE GOTTA GET READY AND STUFF.
Yeah, ME, TOO. UM...
look, THANKS FOR JUST LISTENING.
that's FINE. YEAH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
Chuck JUST WANTED A BUMP, AND BLAIR'S PHONE WAS TURNED OFF, SO IT, UM, REALLY MEANS A LOT.
Yeah, ANYTIME, NATE. I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT, OKAY?
all RIGHT. I'LL SEE YA. BYE.
Hey, ANYBODY HOME?
Hey, YOU AND DAN GOING OUT?
just TO THE MOVIES. WHAT ABOUT YOU?
a HUMPHREY MAN IN A SPORTS COAT?
I'd NORMALLY ASK IF YOU HAD A DATE, BUT-- BUT MY WIFE LEFT ME, HMM?
Yeah. WHAT'S UP WITH ALISON? DAN SAYS SHE'S STILL UPSTATE.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST FOR THE SUMMER. SO DID HER HUSBAND.
okay, WE'LL CIRCLE BACK TO THAT.
one ISSUE AT A TIME. LIKE WHERE ARE MY KEYS?
what DO YOU NEED KEYS FOR? JUST USE DAN'S WINDOW.
where IS DAN, BY THE WAY?
uh, HE SHOULD BE BACK IN A MINUTE. HMM.
so, UH, DAN SEEMS HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
why WOULDN'T HE BE?
well, UM, IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING SO,
when YOU LEFT HERE, YOU KIND OF BROKE HIS HEART.
I'm BACK, AREN'T I?
I HATED BEING AWAY FROM THE CITY.
away FROM DAN.
did YOU TELL DAN THIS?
no, NOT YET, BUT I'M PLANNING ON IT TONIGHT
before OR AFTER THE MOVIE. I'M NOT SURE YET.
you KNOW, I GOTTA PICK MY MOMENT.
it's KIND OF A BIG DEAL.
Oh, THANKS.
you KNOW, THERE'S, UH,
a LOT THAT'S CHANGED SINCE YOU WERE HERE.
so DAN SAYS.
but YOU GUYS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CLOSE.
you'll FIGURE IT OUT.
wish ME LUCK?
me, TOO.
where ARE YOU GOING ANYWAY? UH, JUST SOME PARTY.
with A FRIEND?
I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL HER THAT.
see YA.
Hello?
Hey. WHERE ARE YOU? AT YOUR HOUSE.
Oh. OH, YOU'RE EARLY.
Yeah, I JUST COULDN'T WAIT.
Oh, UM, I TRIED TO GET YOU BEFORE YOU LEFT.
I-I FEEL TERRIBLE.
cause I'M EARLY?
no, BECAUSE, UM, I... I TOTALLY SPACED.
I HAVE THIS, UH,
american HISTORY PAPER DUE MONDAY.
so YOU KNOW, I'LL BE WRITING ALL NIGHT.
I'll make it up to you, though. I promise.
PIEROGIS AT VESELKA?
I'll CALL YOU TOMORROW.
Jenny, HEY.
Hey.
W
Jenny, WHAT'S WRONG?
and HOW IS THIS A FAVOR TO ME AGAIN?
Rufus, LOOK AROUND. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD ACCESS TO THE TOP PEOPLE IN MUSIC AND ART?
introduce YOURSELF. REVITALIZE YOUR FLAGGING CAREER.
put THAT SAD LITTLE GALLERY ON THE CULTURAL RADAR.
since WHEN WERE YOU THE PATRON SAINT OF FORMER ROCK STARS?
since WHEN WERE YOU A STAR? NO, LOOK, LEAVE IF YOU WANT TO.
really. ALISON WOULD HAVE A FIT IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE ACCOMPANYING ME TO THIS PARTY,
even IF IT WAS FOR YOUR BENEFIT. ACTUALLY, I DON'T CARE WHAT ALISON THINKS RIGHT NOW.
good. THEN LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR HOSTESS.
it IS DIVINE. SQUINT, AND IT'S MARRAKECH.
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE BRINGING A DATE.
how DELIGHTFUL. OH, THIS IS RUFUS HUMPHREY.
Oh, IT'S NOT A DATE. OH, PLEASURE.
it's NOT A DATE. MM-HMM.
look. APPETIZERS. IS THAT COUSCOUS?
Yes, PLEASE.
Hey. BART!
Hi.
and FRIEND.
Oh. MM. SOMETHING CATCH YOUR EYE?
Oh, I LIKE HER OUTFIT. LILY.
hello.
Hi.
I'd LIKE YOU TO MEET CARISSA. YEAH, HI. CARISSA.
Hi.
Hi. RUFUS. HI, RUFUS.
Yeah, HI. WELL, IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
great TO SEE YOU. ENJOY.
you AND BART BASS? SUDDENLY IT ALL MAKES SENSE.
you BROUGHT ME HERE TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS. OH, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
I MEAN, IT'S FLATTERING, I GUESS,
but COULDN'T YOU HAVE DONE A LITTLE BETTER? OH, NOT ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.
Oh! HOW ARE YOU? THIS IS FANTASTIC.
this IS BEAUTIFUL. GOD BLESS YOU.
so THIS BLAIR GIRL USED YOU AS HER SLAVE?
no, I WAS HER HANDMAIDEN. "HANDMAIDEN" IS JANE AUSTEN FOR "SLAVE."
she NEVER ACTUALLY SAID I WOULD GET TO GO TO THE BALL,
even IF I DID ALL THOSE ERRANDS. UNH-UNH. DON'T MAKE EXCUSES FOR HER.
you DID ALL THAT STUFF. YOU DESERVE TO GO. I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT MASKED BALLS ARE "TOTALLY PRETENTIOUS." ONE WOMAN'S OPINION.
but IF YOU WANNA GO, NO BLAIR SHOULD KEEP YOU AWAY.
it's NOT JUST BLAIR. I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE A GOWN. MY FRIEND WORKS IN THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT AT B. A.M.
we CAN BORROW ONE. NEXT? I DON'T HAVE AN INVITATION.
every BALLROOM HAS A BACK DOOR. WHAT ELSE?
if BLAIR SAW ME, SHE'D BE FURIOUS.
then IT'S A GOOD THING YOU'LL BE WEARING A MASK.
on THE UPPER EAST SIDE, APPEARANCES ARE OFTEN DECEIVING. FROM FRIENDS TO HAIR COLOR,
there's ALWAYS MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE.
is UPTOWN THIS WAY OR THAT WAY?
it's, UH, THAT WAY,
and THESE THINGS WHIZZING BY HERE- THEY'RE CARS.
you MIGHT WANT TO AVOID THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT?
you'll SEE BETTER WITHOUT THIS, TOO. WHOA. THAT IS BETTER.
Hey, YOU GOT A NAME?
Hi. JACK ALTMAN. I JUST STEPPED OUT FOR SOME AIR.
Altman? OKAY.
come ON. THANK YOU.
wait. LET ME SEE.
okay, LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE COMPLETELY MORALLY OPPOSED TO SOCIETY EVENTS AND STUFF, BUT
we'll DEPROGRAM YOU LATER. THIS IS UGLY.
just GO.
all RIGHT. THANKS.
thank YOU SO MUCH. ANYTIME.
what WAS IT WE SAID ABOUT APPEARANCES?
Yes, THEY CAN BE DECEIVING.
but MOST OF THE TIME, WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET.
Hey.
have YOU SEEN THAT GIRL I WAS WITH?
when I GRABBED HER BAG, I GOT HER HOUSE KEYS, TOO.
what IS NATE DOING?
he's SUPPOSED TO GO FIND KATI AND IS.
it's GETTING LATE, AND I'M LOSING HEAT. WELL, YOU LOOK RAVISHING.
if I WERE YOUR MAN, I WOULDN'T NEED CLUES TO FIND YOU.
or TO RAVISH ME, I'M SURE. WHO IS THAT?
probably SOME BITCH FROM CHAPIN.
hot BITCH FROM CHAPIN.
forget HER. GO GET NATE. POINT HIM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
first THINGS FIRST.
well, HELLO, ANGEL.
you MUST BE MY LUCKY NIGHT.
and WITH TASTE TO BOOT.
apparently NOT.
I'm TALKING TO YOU.
beautiful AND MEAN? I'VE GOT CHILLS.
care TO DANCE WITH A POOR DEVIL?
why DON'T WE JUST SKIP ALL THAT AND, UH,
go SOMEWHERE QUIET TO TALK?
I'll GET THE CHAMPAGNE.
find ME IN FIVE.
taking A COMPANY PUBLIC IS AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY.
there's NOTHING MORE VALUABLE THAN MAKING A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION.
and YOU TAUGHT ME THAT, ELEANOR. CAPTAIN, YOU KNOW THAT I ADORE YOU,
but YOU'VE NEVER DONE FASHION BEFORE.
I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO CALVIN'S PEOPLE, AND I HAVE TO SAY,
the PRESENTATION IS VERY IMPRESSIVE. ENOUGH BUSINESS TALK, HOWARD. YOU'RE BORING HER.
Mm. ELEANOR, I'VE BEEN THINKING.
when NATE AND BLAIR GET ENGAGED,
she SHOULD HAVE MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER'S RING,
the ONE THAT CORNELIUS VANDERBILT GAVE HER?
you STILL SPYING ON HIM?
I'm NOT SPYING. I'M JUST...
keeping TRACK OF HIS WHEREABOUTS.
well, SO LONG AS YOU'RE WATCHING, HE'S WINNING.
if YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE A MAN JEALOUS,
there's ONLY ONE THING TO DO. RUFUS, I INVITED YOU HERE FOR MANY REASONS,
but KNOWLEDGE OF ROMANCE IS NOT...
that WAS, UM...
unexpected.
give HIM 20 MINUTES.
I NEED A DRINK. I NEED A DRINK.
so EVERY TIME WE SEE THEIR YACHT NOW,
we JUST PULL OUT OUR AIR HORNS AND LET 'EM RIP.
Wow. I TELL YOU, IT IS ALMOST ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU NEVER WANT TO SUMMER IN NEWPORT AGAIN.
wow, THAT SOUNDS, UH, AWFUL.
it IS. IT'S PRETTY BAD.
Yeah, YEAH, UM, YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I, UH, I THINK I'M GONNA GO AND-- CHANGE PARTNERS?
Hey.
Dan, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M SAVING YOU.
I DON'T NEED TO BE SAVED. REALLY? 'CAUSE, UH, I COULD SEE YOUR EYES ROLLING TO THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD FROM ACROSS THE ROOM. DAN.
Hey. BLAIR SENT US OVER.
she SAID IT'S GETTING LATE, AND YOU'RE TAKING TOO LONG.
your LADY-IN-WAITING IS CLOSER THAN YOU THINK,
her HEADDRESS IS FEATHERS OF BLACK AND PINK.
it's HER. IT'S ME.
what? I'M SORRY.
just FIND SERENA.
she'll LEAD YOU TO BLAIR.
Serena. RIGHT.
let's PLAY A GAME. I'D SAY STRIP POKER, BUT I DON'T HAVE MY CARDS.
how ABOUT, UH, HIDE-AND-SEEK?
you HIDE. I'LL SEEK.
and HOW WILL YOU FIND ME? I DON'T HAVE ANY BREAD CRUMBS.
well, YOU CAN LEAVE ME A TRAIL WITH YOUR CLOTHES.
what ARE YOU REALLY DOING HERE, DAN?
what AM I DOING HERE? I RAN ACROSS THE CITY.
I RENTED A TUXEDO. I STOLE THIS MASK FROM SOME DRUNKEN KID,
only TO LOOK LIKE ROBIN.
I FOUND MY WAY IN HERE, ALL TO SEE YOU. I CARE.
well, YOU DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE THIS MORNING,
when YOU WERE WITH ANOTHER GIRL AND LIED TO ME. WHAT? WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I-I DIDN'T--WELL... I DID.
Yeah. I DID, BUT I CAN EXPLAIN.
go AHEAD. GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.
I WAS WITH MY FRIEND VANESSA.
we're VERY CLOSE, AND SHE MOVED AWAY TO VERMONT LAST YEAR,
and NOW SHE'S BACK.
okay, SO WHY'D YOU LIE AND SAY IT WAS JENNY?
because I'M AN IDIOT.
I D--I DON'T KNOW WHY. I...
look, VANESSA AND I...
our RELATIONSHIP IS A LITTLE COMPLICATED,
or IT WAS, BEFORE I MET YOU.
and HONESTLY, I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO GET IN THE WAY OF YOU INVITING ME TO THIS...
stupid PARTY.
well, I WAS GONNA INVITE YOU.
Really?
so NOT INTO, UH,
you're SAYING YOU'RE NOT INTO OLD FRIEND VANESSA?
that IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING.
Oh, YES,
the OTHER PART WE LOVE ABOUT A MASQUERADE?
when THE MASK FINALLY COMES OFF AND THE TRUTH IS REVEALED TO ALL.
will YOU EXCUSE ME?
I JUST SAW THE LAST PERSON I EVER EXPECTED TO SEE.
Yeah. HOW CAN I SAY NO TO THAT?
I'm SORRY.
Vanessa. VANESSA. HEY.
this IS A SURPRISE.
funny. I COULD SAY THE SAME THING.
What--what ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M WRITING AN AMERICAN HISTORY PAPER.
wait. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE YOU.
when DID WE START LYING TO EACH OTHER? I-I MERELY REFRAINED FROM SHARING THE TRUTH,
which WOULD HAVE SOUNDED A LOT MORE LIKE A LIE THAN WHAT I TOLD YOU. HUMPHREY.
I'm--I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT EITHER, I ADMIT,
but WHAT WAS I GOING TO SAY? THAT I WAS RENTING A TUXEDO
to ATTEND A MASKED BALL WITHOUT A MASK OR AN INVITATION
to GO GET A GIRL WHO NOT ONLY HAS A MASK AND AN INVITATION,
but ANOTHER DATE? AT LEAST IT'S HONEST.
you--you HATE THIS WORLD. SO DO YOU, OR SO I THOUGHT.
all RIGHT, WHAT'S GOING ON EXACTLY?
did YOU FOLLOW ME HERE TO PROVE THAT I WAS LYING?
Yes, DAN, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I STALKED YOU BECAUSE I AM JUST SO OBSESSED WITH YOU.
wait. DON'T STOP THERE.
you're THE WHOLE REASON I CAME BACK TO NEW YORK, 'CAUSE I JUST COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU. ALL RIGHT, I GET THE POINT. YOU CAN LAY OFF THE SARCASM
how ABOUT I LAY OFF THE WHOLE EVENING? BYE. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, STOP.
hold ON. LISTEN. I'M--I'M SORRY.
I'm SORRY THAT I LIED ABOUT WRITING A TERM PAPER. YOU SAID YOU LOVE ME.
loved YOU...
in THE PAST AND IN A PRESHAVING, 16-YEAR-OLD KIND OF WAY.
you KNOW, I MEAN, THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
clearly.
looks LIKE SOMEONE'S TRADED UP.
so THAT'S, UM...
Vanessa, YEAH. SHE'S...
beautiful.
I-I-I HAVE TO GO AFTER HER. I'M SORRY.
feel FREE TO FIND ME.
I FOUND YOUR PANTS.
well, YOU'RE GETTING WARMER,
which IS AN ACHIEVEMENT CONSIDERING YOU'RE ALREADY HOT.
well, YOU BETTER HOPE IT DOESN'T GET COLD.
what IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
what THE HELL?!
Hey, MY PHONE IS IN MY PANTS, AND I'M STUCK UP HERE, BITCH!
Vanessa, WAIT, PLEASE.
why WON'T YOU WAIT? COME HERE--OH.
because YOU'RE NOT VANESSA. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
case OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY.
ironically, NOT INVOLVING MASKS.
there YOU ARE.
Oh, I JUST NEEDED A MOMENT.
that-- WHAT JUST HAPPENED-- THE KISS?
Yeah, IT MADE ME FEEL A LITTLE-- NOSTALGIC?
nauseous. RIGHT, UM, OUCH.
no, I'M--I'M KIDDING, KIND OF.
I'm SORRY, RUFUS.
I-I--MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED YOU HERE.
right, UM, AND, UM,
I'm SORRY I KISSED YOU, BUT I DID IT BECAUSE
that MERCENARY IN THE STARCHED WHITE SHIRT
he DOESN'T APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE OVER AN ATTRACTIVE 25-YEAR-OLD MANNEQUIN.
cause BEAUTY FADES,
though YOURS HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB OF HOLDING ON,
and IN THE LONG RUN, IT'S GONNA BE HIS LOSS.
and I THOUGHT HE SHOULD KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO LOSE YOU.
cause TRUST ME, IT'S NOT FUN.
I THINK IT WORKED.
Lily, MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT?
if YOU'LL EXCUSE US.
happy TO HELP.
she MEANS NOTHING.
Jenny? HEY.
um, LOOK, YOU DIDN'T SEE ME HERE, OKAY?
Yeah, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. JUST ONE IN A SERIES OF THINGS I'LL PRETEND DIDN'T HAPPEN TONIGHT. IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
I'm NOT SURE. DAN SURPRISED ME BY SHOWING UP HERE.
well, GO, DAN! YEAH, EXCEPT THEN HE THREW ME FOR A LOOP BY CHASING AFTER SOME GIRL NAMED VANESSA.
no, VANESSA'S DAN'S BEST FRIEND. YEAH, WELL, THEY SEEMED LIKE A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT.
they've KIND OF GOT A HISTORY, DON'T THEY?
sure.
but, I MEAN, DAN'S NEVER LIKED A GIRL LIKE HE LIKES YOU.
really. I MEAN, COME ON. HE'S AT A MASKED BALL,
and I THINK HE'D GO BASICALLY ANYWHERE WITH YOU...
except FOR MAYBE THE ICE CAPADES 'CAUSE THAT REALLY FREAKED HIM OUT WHEN HE WAS 5.
you KNOW WHAT? I...
I THINK I'LL GO AND TRY TO FIND HIM.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA FIND ANYONE.
this STUPID MASK KEEPS FALLING OVER MY EYES.
well, I'D GIVE YOU MINE, BUT MASKS COME OFF AT MIDNIGHT,
and I KIND OF NEED MY DISGUISE TO GET OUT OF HERE.
you KNOW WHAT? YOU WANNA TRADE?
sure.
Thanks.
and HERE, TAKE THIS. IT'S SO HOT IN HERE,
and YOU'LL PROBABLY BE COLD OUTSIDE.
here YOU GO.
did YOU HAVE FUN TONIGHT?
it WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED.
good.
okay, LET'S SEE. HERE.
Oh, THANKS. PRETTY.
Serena, JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING AND LET ME EXPLAIN.
I've BEEN TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING, BUT IT'S KILLING ME.
look, I KNOW WE BOTH CARE ABOUT BLAIR, BUT MAYBE THE BEST THING IS FOR ME TO JUST TELL HER THE TRUTH.
I'm NOT OVER YOU, AND I THOUGHT I COULD FIGHT IT, BUT I CAN'T.
and IF YOU DON'T STOP ME, I'M GONNA KISS YOU.
Nate, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT.
you HAVE TO FIND BLAIR. LOOK, OKAY, WHATEVER.
just FORGET THE CLUE. SHE'S WEARING BIG, TALL BOOTS
and A BIG OLD CROWN. JUST GO, OKAY? HURRY.
Serena, HAVE YOU SEEN NATE? HEY!
it's MIDNIGHT! MASKS OFF!
Serena! SERE--SERENA, WAIT.
I'm SO SORRY. SERENA!
little JENNY HUMPHREY MANAGES TO GET MY PANTS OFF AND HAVE ME NOT ENJOY IT.
quite THE ACCOMPLISHMENT.
good THING SOMEONE ELSE AT THE PARTY WAS AS LECHEROUS AS YOU,
or YOU'D STILL BE UP ON THAT ROOF, AND, NO,
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU HAD TO DO TO GET THAT TUX.
this IS ME.
all RIGHT, CHUCK, I'LL SEE YOU IN THE A. M.
Unh-unh. NO, YOU DIDN'T FIND ME BY MIDNIGHT.
no HAPPILY EVER AFTER FOR YOU.
Blair, I'M--I'M SORRY.
all I WANTED WAS FOR US TO START OVER,
and YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY.
well, AT LEAST SOMEBODY'S HAVING A GOOD NIGHT.
Hello?
Serena, HEY. WHAT-- WILL YOU PLEASE JUST TALK TO ME?
please. WHY DID YOU RUN AWAY FROM ME?
wait. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
you're THE ONE THAT RAN AWAY. I DON'T THINK SO.
blonde HAIR, YELLOW DRESS, BLACK FURRY THING?
there IS ONLY ONE SERENA VAN DER WOODSEN.
Yeah, NO, NOT TONIGHT.
let ME SAY...
for THE RECORD...
I LIKE YOU.
only YOU.
well, THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE I FEEL THE SAME ABOUT YOU.
I'm GLAD THAT'S CLEARED UP.
Hey, UM, YOU KNOW,
I HEAR THE ICE CAPADES ARE COMING TO TOWN.
Mm. IF YOU'RE THERE, SO AM I.
Hey.
you GUYS ARE UP LATE.
we WERE CELEBRATING.
Eleanor WALDORF HAS AGREED TO LET YOUR FATHER'S FIRM TAKE HER COMPANY PUBLIC.
Congrats. THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
it IS, WHICH IS WHY I WAS LOOKING FOR A WINE OPENER
so I COULD SURPRISE YOUR FATHER WITH A BOTTLE OF MARGAUX,
which IS HOW I FOUND THIS.
well, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF, NATE?
what?
well, IT ISN'T MINE, AND IT ISN'T YOUR FATHER'S,
so THAT ONLY LEAVES ONE OTHER PERSON IN THIS HOUSE.
Hey, YOU'RE STILL UP.
Yeah, NOT THAT TIRED. WELL, I AM. I'M EXHAUSTED.
I ENDED UP GOING TO THAT BALL, ACTUALLY.
Oh, REALLY?
Yeah.
well, YOUR NIGHT'S NOT OVER.
there's SOMEONE HERE TO SEE YOU.
PIEROGIS? I COME IN PEACE.
great. 'CAUSE I'M STARVING.
look
save IT, HUMPHREY. YOU'VE NEVER DONE CONTRITE WELL.
besides, I'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD APOLOGIZE.
no, REALLY, I AM. I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT SERENA.
and I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU. WELL, I SHOULDN'T HAVE LIED ABOUT TONIGHT.
and I SHOULDN'T HAVE RUN OUT ON YOU.
look, IF WE'RE GONNA BE FRIENDS AGAIN,
we're GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE THIS STUFF OUT.
you're RIGHT,
and I'VE MISSED HAVING A FRIEND.
I've MISSED BEING ONE.
we CAN START SLOW, WITH THE BASICS.
like, UH, FEWER LIES, MORE UKRAINIAN FOOD.
and YOU TELLING ME ABOUT EVERYTHING I MISSED WHILE I WAS GONE,
such AS SERENA.
well, SHE'S PRETTY FANTASTIC,
almost AS GOOD AS THIS PIEROGI.
Yeah, SHE'S GOT THIS CRAZY MOTHER WHO'S ALWAYS, LIKE,
sparring WITH ME, AND THIS-AND THIS BEST FRIEND WHO'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO DEAL WITH.
the BEST FRIEND HAS A BOYFRIEND WHO'S HARD FOR ME TO DEAL WITH.
gossip girl here
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
you'll never believe what's on "gossip girl."
someone saw Serena getting off a train at grand central.
I thought everything was good between us.
it was, before I found out you had sex with my boyfriend.
I didn't come back for you.
look, Blair's my best friend, and you're her boyfriend, and she loves you.
you'd really go out with some guy you don't know?
well, he can't be worse than the guys I do know.
Loved...you.
where people can be transported to another time, where they can feel free to let loose.
no judgment. Pure escape.
what happens at Victrola stays at Victrola.
well, it does have franchise potential.
Chuck Bass, I do believe all your years of underage boozing and womanizing have finally paid off.
truly, I am proud.
and you are my toughest critic.
well, second toughest.
so do you think your father will go for it?
it is exactly the kind of innovative thinking upon which the Bass empire was built.
it is the perfect thing. I've been waiting for this.
we are so late. Are you coming?
gotta pitch it to Bart.
victory party here tomorrow.
I wouldn't miss it.
I'll send a car.
don't be nervous.
he's gonna love it.
they all seem very discreet.
it's up to you, but you will choose a facility, and you will get the help that you need, after our dinner with the Waldorfs tomorrow night, of course, unless you'd like to ruin the celebration honoring your father's new business union with Eleanor.
Anne, it's all right.
let me talk to him.
how could you not tell her the drugs were yours?
you're not gonna end up in one of these places.
let me talk to yeah,'cause it's mom who's the problem, right?
look, work's been kicking my ass lately.
the old man doesn't wear the hours as well as he used to.
this young viper at the office, Frank Meltzer, saw me fading one night, so he offered me a pick-me-up.
it was stupid. I didn't even like it.
Hey, I'll flush the bag right now, all right?
dad, I just want you to be...
look, let's not put a damper on the upcoming festivities.
I've landed the Waldorf account, and my son has landed the Waldorf.
so that's it?
Hey, I'm not cutting the conversation short.
drinks after school at the club?
Nonalcoholic, of course.
no, you don't understand, Vanessa.
okay, the store lent it to me for the ball, and if I don't find it, Blair is gonna kill me.
it's under her name, and she doesn't even know I went.
no, Alison, I sent that two weeks ago.
dad, have you seen a bracelet?
you know, round, silverish, sparkly?
Yeah, I think I saw that next to that ambiguous vague thing by the nondescript place.
he hasn't seen it.
no, Alison, I-wh--I haven't told them anything yet.
well, what should I be telling them when I don't even know what's...
who you talking to?
your mother.
tell her I say hi.
Jenny says hello who are you talking to?
Where's the other Humphrey?
brick not comfortable. - All right, I'll take one for the team.
Yeah, this is definitely not very comfortable.
I know. You'd think all the money that we spent on this private school, they could at least give us a comfortable spot to make out.
or a better chemistry teacher.
Mr. Peiser is a little weird.
wait, you're thinking about Mr. Peiser right now?
we are at school.
Hey, Serena. Why don't you get a room?
Oh, that's the plight of the Manhattan teenager.
no cars.
you know, we could find a place more private.
our parents aren't always home.
that's true.
they must eventually leave.
the problem is waiting for eventually.
what's the rush?
really, it's not like this sucks.
minus the brick and the paparazzi.
spotted-- Serena and not-so-lonely boy clearly past courtship in the courtyard.
Bye.
you know, we should talk about this, though, - about us, about eventually. - Definitely.
Yes. Yes.
or we could just get it over with in a broom closet.
in a broom closet? That is-- that is rich, Serena.
Mr. Peiser's waiting.
but can Brooklyn keep up with the uptown express?
Serena, right?
uh, that's... funny.
mm, not really. No. - No.
uh, what are you doing in the girls' hall?
I was actually looking for you.
you know, I really didn't mean anything I said about having feelings for Serena.
maybe you didn't.
I just-- I mean, I don't even care, but other people might.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, including my brother.
you brought me chocolates?
well, I know you care about being friends with Blair, and your brother,
he's with Serena, and I'm with Blair, and I just really need you to help me out here.
you promise?
promise what?
uh, promise to help me come up with a more creative apology than these.
I'm sorry for taking you for granted lately, okay?
that is so sweet!
but I prefer the gold collection, but thank you.
Hey, cinderella.
I think you dropped this at the ball.
I hate secrets more than anything.
you know that.
friends don't lie, and we're friends, right?
right.
Jenny Humphrey's rise to the penthouse has been short and sweet, but if she crosses Blair Waldorf, it's straight back to the basement.
looks like this little lamb needs to stay silent or else.
when can I go public with you?
my kids have to know first.
well, your secret's safe with me.
father.
um, well...
Bart, um, I think your points earlier were excellent...
and, um, I plan to bring them up at the next parent/teacher meeting.
um, thank you, Lily.
not much future as an actress.
you don't say anything to Serena.
you don't say anything to anyone.
Lily would like this to play out in a certain way.
so you're serious about her?
what's with the business formal?
are you being arraigned for something?
I have an investment idea I think is utterly unique to your company.
something avant-garde, yet nostalgic.
it is the perfect way for you to loosen the top button of Bass inc.
like you've been wanting, sir.
I am so pleased.
you are?
are you kidding me?
do you how long I've been waiting for you to be interested in something other than partying?
you should come see the place.
it sells itself.
I have some meetings, but, uh, how's after.
A-after's--after's great.
after's good.
so...
I heard on "gossip girl" that you were having sex with Dan out here...
in streaming video.
God, Kati and is filmed us?
Oh, it's all very "high school musical" scandalous.
and no, they haven't streamed it yet, but...
I heard it was...
aggressive.
I must say, Dan has been surprisingly good at everything we've done.
which is... everything?
No!
but feel free to ask any personal questions.
but you've talked about it, right?
no, mom, we haven't.
may I remind you that this is your first real boyfriend, S.
and in relationships, you talk about stuff.
I know, but I don't know, sometimes talking about it or planning it can ruin a good thing, you know?
I would know.
well, as long as you're not worried.
well, I'm not, but I don't know, he might be.
is it possible for a guy to want to slow things down?
only the guys we like.
but...
with you, I can't imagine why.
how was I?
I don't know.
let's ask the judges.
I was gonna give you a 3, but since you're a virgin,
I gave you an extra point.
Hey, I chose to wait.
sex is meaningful, like art, and you don't rush art.
who's art?
did you sleep with him?
did you sleep with him?
did you or did you not sleep with him?
Yes, Alison, I did encourage you to do your paintings, not the next door neighbor.
Hello? Hello?
Ah, Dan, I-I didn't realize you were home.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.
well, I did.
something about, uh, uh, mom and a neighbor?
Yeah, it's... complicated.
mom's having an affair. It's easy when you just say it.
not to your son.
well, she hasn't exactly been rushing back to us.
it's good to know why.
I'm home.
what's going on, dad?
uh, nothing.
just gotta get some groceries.
uh, sorry, Jen. I got a lot of homework, so...
away.
what?
Oh, sorry, Nate.
I have to take a rain check on our drink.
Why?
client in crisis.
can't get out of the office, but I'll be home as soon as I can.
well, dad, our talk was kind of important.
it's business, Nate. You understand, right?
we'll talk later.
looks like parents can be deceiving on both sides of the bridge.
you are...
really talented.
dad.
I didn't think you'd make it.
and you want me to pour hundreds of thousands of dollars into an excuse for you to be around booze and women?
no. No, I...
did you read the proposal? It shows a much bigger picture.
I came down here because I saw the effort you made.
you want to impress me with your commitment to something?
try getting a few a's in school or maybe a part-time job.
let's go get some lunch.
looks like the pot calling the kettle black has young Bass boiling over, and if we know Chuck, he's not one to let things lie.
someone pour that man a drink.
you need to look elegant for the Archibald dinner tomorrow night, so what do you think?
Yes, it would be very nice, if I was sailing up on the Mayflower.
Anne Archibald was wearing her amazing Cornelius Vanderbilt diamond ring the other night.
she was going on and on about how it would end up on your finger...someday.
wait.
Nate spoke to his mother about our future?
he actually asked for the family ring?
looks like cold, hard cash can get you the cold, hard truth.
didn't anyone tell you, N.
be careful what you fish for.
I can't believe we actually got the apartment to ourselves.
you got downtown pretty fast.
well, with an opportunity like this, one needs to take advantage.
how long do you think till your dad and sister will be back?
uh, anywhere from an hour to 20 minutes?
well, 20 minutes is plenty.
it's kind of bright in here, don't you think?
uh, maybe get some blinds or a... a clapper.
mm, how about next time?
Hey, Dan. Hungry?
hello.
Hi. - Hi.
Vanessa, right?
good to see you.
good to see you.
and good to see you seeing us seeing you.
excuse me.
you really need to start using that door.
which you're showing me to.
well, practice makes perfect.
leaving, out the door.
and we appreciate it.
sorry.
so do you think we should talk about it?
you mean about-- about Vanessa?
no, you know what? She's like family.
it feels comfortable, and so therefore, she often shows up without calling.
no, I-I mean about what almost, maybe, might have just happened.
Oh, you mean if Vanessa hadn't entered, and we...
or we could not talk about it.
Dan, we're home.
we got breakfast.
hungry?
spotted-- Bass drunk off his ass at the palace bar, drinking away his woes and investment capital.
Nathaniel, your position in my esteem has been replaced by your voice mail.
so...
Bart didn't go for Vicola, but truth is I bought the house out already for tonight, and it's not a par-tay without my people or any people.
I'll see you there.
long night?
alfonso made me an omelet.
I may have washed it down with a bellini or two.
you father didn't go for your business proposal.
come on.
let me help you.
he was born poor.
I was born loaded. - Yeah.
but if the only way to impress him is if I started with nothing, then why doesn't he just take it all away?
because he loves you.
no good parent likes to see his child go without.
I had the idea.
I did the work.
he tells me I can't be committed, and he's the one screwing 25 year olds...
when he's supposedly committed to you.
we're newly committed, as recent as last week.
I wonder why he was pawing some Asian chick in his limo yesterday.
how could I be surprised, really?
excuse me.
I'm on my way.
uh, I'm late for my blowout at Arden's.
mom, please.
the drugs were dad's.
I mean, I guess he thought it'd be easier on everyone if I took the hit, but they were his.
I don't understand.
no, he promised me he'd flush the coke, then I caught him buying more.
the lengths that you will go to to get out of trouble, Nate.
mom, he has a problem.
I need your help, please.
you look down at the floor every time someone tries to tell you the truth.
just look at me. Mom.
I saw dad buying drugs yesterday.
he's been under a lot of pressure, - and if you hadn't been so difficult lately... - what?
your latest rebellions have been very hard on your father, Nate.
all this business with Dartmouth, your issues with Blair.
mom, dad needs your help.
not another word of this.
we have a celebratory dinner to get to.
please wear a tie.
see...
you curl your fingers into a fist, and with simple thrust of force, you knock on the door.
Hey, I didn't use the fire escape.
baby steps.
and what are you doing watching porn?
it's not porn. It's art cinema.
Oh, from what I saw earlier, you don't need to be doing research.
I can't talk about this with you.
I'm curious, though, about the change in your attitude, because may I remind you, that in your pale, romantic, tortured days, you'd wax on, and I quote, that, "sex is meaningful, like art, and you don't rush art.
that was in, uh, 25.
I was more idealistic then.
I was much younger, and there wasn't an actual girl who wanted to have sex with me.
you're...
going to lose your virginity.
Ooh, can you... - My friend Dan.
please not turn my sex life into a country song?
it's okay.
I'm sure Serena knows what to do, what with her vast experiences with boarding school professors, pamplonian bullfighters, best friends' boyfriends...
that's enough now. You can go. Please.
but if it were me with you...
I'd want you to hide cedric, maybe get some candles and replace the football sheets.
but...
take it or leave it. - Thanks.
thanks for helping me out with the bracelet.
I didn't know a broken clasp could cost that much.
Oh, it was my pleasure.
Oh, wait. No, it wasn't.
game recognizes game, little J.
but you have to show more respect.
this is the last time I've helped you.
next time you cross me, I won't be as forgiving.
don't worry. There won't be a next time.
good,'cause I wanna tell you something, something nobody knows, not even Serena.
you can keep a secret, right?
of course.
Nate is planning on giving me his family diamond.
it's the most incredible ring you've ever seen.
uh, ring as in engagement ring?
I remember the first time I ever saw him.
maybe we were just little kids, but I knew he's the one I wanna marry.
now it seems like he feels the same way, too.
why are you not happy for me?
I'm sorry.
it's--it's just been a really weird week.
um, there's this stuff with my parents and my family, so maybe I should just go.
no, maybe you should look at me in the eye and tell me what you're hiding.
are you jealous?
of you and Nate? - Do you like him?
what? No.
do you think because you talked to him once in the hall that you might have a shot?
Blair, it's nothing like that.
then tell me, what is it like?
I don't want to hurt you.
how could you hurt me?
yesterday wasn't the first time I talked to Nate.
at the ball, he told me he wasn't over Serena.
why would he tell you that?
cause I was wearing her mask, and he thought I was her.
he kissed me.
that's enough.
Blair, I-I didn't want you to find out.
you're dismissed, Jenny...
for good.
you look beautiful tonight.
anything on your mind?
no.
is there anything you wanna say?
no.
the leg wrap-- that's interesting.
sexy, right?
and it increases stability.
sure. Yeah, I can see that.
the hair grab-- does that really work?
Oh, yeah. Every time.
okay, so leg wrap to hair grab.
do... hold on a second.
do--do I have to keep my shirt open and billowing like that?
well, it never hurts.
nice.
I'm--I'm doomed.
sensuous massage.
something we should talk about?
Oh, uh, no.
you know, I have a lot of-- a lot of tension, stress in between my, um, shoulder blades.
so...
I'm headed to the gallery to, uh, test run a 24-hour projection installation.
Vanessa and Jenny are over there. Do you want to come?
um, 24 hours is a very long time to be working straight.
so I think I might just chill here.
alone?
on a saturday night?
with your new girlfriend?
son...
dad, we've had the talk already.
do you need a refresher?
etched in my brain. Thanks.
well, just be safe.
don't do anything you're not ready to do--or she's not.
Oh, and, uh, lose the football sheets...
and Cedric.
well, you look pretty good for a dead messenger.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
you did.
now Blair knows the truth, and she and Nate can talk about it.
honest communication is what every good relationship is based on, at least, that's what I hear.
I just--I think how I'd feel, you know, if I loved someone, and they betrayed me.
how would you ever get things back to the way they were?
wait, are we still talking about Blair and Nate here?
Yeah, of course.
what else can we be talking about?
I don't know. Your parents?
look, maybe you don't go back, maybe you go forward.
get two people in a room willing to be balls-out honest?
it might get ugly, but eventually, the dust has to settle, and then you can see if there's hope.
we've celebrated the partnership, but I don't think we've given Eleanor her just due.
this lady is fantastic.
Oh, well, uh, thank you, Howard.
more cheese?
have you tried the Humboldt Fog? It's quite good.
Eleanor's right. Enough business talk.
right.
let's focus on our families' other joint venture,
the union of our children.
I have to say, every time I look at Anne's finger - and see Blair's future engagement ring... - Yes.
I can hardly contain my joy.
Blair, why don't you try it on?
no, thank you.
it's all right.
Yes, I would like to see it. - Anne, give it to Blair.
dad, she doesn't want to try on the ring.
Howie, why don't we just let it alone?
just give it to the girl, Anne.
Eleanor, do we have another bottle?
if there was ever an occasion for the toast, this is it.
they're gonna make such a beautiful couple.
now come on.
slide that thing on.
that's what I'm talking about, huh?
Oh, it's very pretty.
it looks magnificent to me. - Thank you - Everybody, yeah? Yeah? - it's perfect on her.
Oh, now how about that toast? Come on.
everybody, bottoms up.
dad, why don't we go smoke the cigars we got, huh?
good idea. Excuse us.
certainly.
this seat taken? - Father.
the light of day doesn't do this place any justice.
I told him he had to check it out when the joint was in full swing.
Chuck, this is Pauletta Cho.
Chuck Bass. Pleasure.
all mine.
Pauletta interviewed me for that recent piece in "the observer,"
roped me into a lunch yesterday to pitch me on the idea of helping her with a career change.
what can I say?
I'm tired of reporting on titans.
I wanna be one myself.
right. Well, uh, who better to help than my father?
as a test, I gave her your proposal that I was given to take a look at.
the math was fine, but what interested me was the wish fulfillment quality to the report.
so perhaps, some, uh, d-school thinking and fatherly bias clouded my judgment.
what do you say?
I love the idea of being a patron of burgeoning talent.
shall we take a full tour?
Yeah.
you know, I've been trying to get ahold of Lily, but, uh, I don't seem able to.
uh, dad.
there's something I have to tell you.
dad, you have a problem. - I don't have a problem.
you're tweaked and embarrassing.
you're trying to tell me you don't have a problem? - Don't be so dramatic.
no, you reminded me every day how important this business deal is to you.
I mean, you've been selling me out trying to make it happen, pushing me towards Dartmouth, towards Blair.
you don't understand.
dad, you're totally sabotaging all of it tonight.
Hey, who the hell are you to tell me?
I'm the adult. You're the kid.
I know.
I'm going back inside.
dad, don't.
Nate, let go of me.
what's going on here? - Nothing. He's my son.
is everything all right?
I said everything's fine.
I'm not asking you.
sorry, dad. You need help.
check his pockets while you're at it.
all right, sir, just relax.
my father went home sick.
spotted on 5th avenue-- a father and son showdown.
too bad not all the witnesses can be bought off.
she's not taking my calls.
I can't believe you did this.
I made a mistake.
this isn't high school, Chuck.
I'm sure she'll take you back once you explain.
I'm not so certain about that.
if she doesn't, I'm not sure that's my fault.
there's a reason she was so quick to believe me.
there's a fire-eater in the ladies lounge.
you two should set a meeting, see if this place can really be something.
I'm gonna try and find Lily and fix this.
what are you doing?
I'm going to victrola.
I promised Chuck. It's important to him.
I saw your father get arrested.
why didn't you come to me?
I would've listened.
I've tried, Blair.
but every time I try, something's got your attention,
a dinner party, you know, a masked ball.
Yeah, let's talk about that masked ball.
let's talk about how while I was waiting for you to find me so that we could finally be together, you were confessing your feelings and kissing serena.
I thought I was doing everything right.
it's not your fault.
do you love me?
you should deal with your father.
he needs you.
you know what?
I don't.
okay, I'm ready.
may I?
I know it may not compare to, uh, a suite at the Ritz in Paris or a chalet in Aspen, and it might be a fire hazard, but...
it's perfect.
Where's Nate?
I think we just broke up. - What?
I don't want to talk about it.
I just want to escape.
that's what this place is for, right?
I know you don't want to talk about what happened, but，
relief.
I feel relief.
you know, I got moves.
Really?
then why don't you get up there?
no, I'm just saying, I have moves.
come on, you're ten times hotter than any of those girls.
I know what you're doing, Bass.
you really don't think I'd go up there.
I know you won't do it.
guard my drink.
who's that girl?
I have no idea.
you go, baby vamp.
as you might have guessed, upper east siders, prohibition never stood a chance against exhibition.
it's human nature to be free.
and no matter how long you try to be good, you can't keep a bad girl down.
well, this is a new strain of obsessive-compulsive.
the, uh, art piece projects up to the ceiling.
Oh, still doing anything to get a girl on her back, huh?
what are you doing here, Lil?
let me ask you that question another way.
did you break up with Bart again?
well, what did I do to deserve such a thorny welcome?
I'm sorry. I'm really not in the mood to play games.
I don't know what's happening with my wife or my marriage, and you showing up here randomly and often doesn't make figuring that out any easier.
I'm sorry I bothered you, really.
Lil, wait.
you know, if you wanna stay and see the, uh, installation, I could really use the company.
Oh, I don't want to be in your way.
since when, Van Der Woodsen?
I've been meaning to get that fixed.
I'm really happy to be here with you right now.
wait.
what? What, did I do something wrong?
no. - I knew the hair thing was too much.
no.
no, it's just, um...
um,"um" is never good.
what? I... I'm scared.
of me?
no.
well, yes, but...
no, it's just-- I've never, um...
you've--you've never-- you're not...
no. - All right.
no, I-I wish.
it's just, nobody's ever looked at me the way you just did.
in fact, I don't think they looked at me at all.
you think I'm crazy, don't you?
no. No, I don't.
are you mad?
come here.
thank you.
mom, hey.
what's going on?
what do you think?
I'm headed down to the police station.
the lawyers will meet me there along with someone from the district attorney's office.
wait, what?
why can't we just pay his bail?
his bail is set at a miion dollars.
what are you talking about? It wasn't even that much coke.
it seems your father is facing some other charges.
for what?
embezzlement and fraud.
I guess they've been building their case for a while.
well, are you coming?
mom...
it's time for you to come home.
you sure?
you want to be part of this world, Jenny,
you need to decide if all this is worth it.
Oh, my god! You'll never believe what's on "gossip girl.
someone saw Serena getting off a train at grand central.
I thought everything was good between us.
it was... before I found out you had sex with my boyfriend.
the best friend and the boyfriend-- that's pretty classy, S.
you'd really go out with some guy you don't know?
well, he can't be worse than the guys I do know.
well, our kids were bound to meet. it's a small island.
are you sure it's not some ploy you're using to get to me?
did you sleep with her, huh?
I know how long you and I have been best friends, okay?
no, it's not okay, Chuck. from now on, you stay away from me.
did something happen last night? yes.
I'm done. I lied, and I stole, and I lost the respect of my family...
for what?
I tried to warn you. there's a price to pay.
Lily, would you do me the honor of being my wife?
he proposed before we left, and I'm going to say yes.
one thing I learned-- that in the face of true love,
you don't just give up,
even if the object of your affection is begging you to.
I'm not who you thought I was, and you can't forgive that.
I don't know how to make things go back to what they were.
I'm locking myself away in the Hamptons.
you know how I get in the summer. -yeah, I do.
if you want to reflect together, I'll be around.
unlike the rest of us, sex, lies and scandal never take a vacation.
instead,
they take the Long island expressway and head east to the Hamptons.
some would say summer is their busiest season.
think park avenue, but with tennis whites and bain de soleil.
the players change, but the game remains the same.
this is so great.
Mmm. are you sure Serena's still okay with covering for you?
she was a little cold. -Oh, she's totally fine.
Mmm. but you haven't told her anything?
all she knows is that I'm seeing someone
I'm not ready to introduce to anyone just yet.
or ever.
look, she needed time to decompress from her breakup anyway.
covering for me works for her, too.
let's go to my place before somebody spots us.
your house?
I thought we couldn't.
there's always the guesthouse.
girls,
you don't know how thankful I am to have
finally found a use for geometry in my daily life.
Yes.
Spotted--Blair Waldorf at Charles de Gaulle homeward bound.
what could possibly make queen B.
abandon her two dads before labor day?
we bet Chuck Bass wants to know. -Mr. Chuck?
is there something you need care taking of?
the only thing I need to take care of is you...
and you...
and you.
also spotted-- Serena Van der Woodsen on Cooper's beach...
alone again.
we've heard talk that things are heating up with Nate Archibald.
and where there's smoke, there's usually fire.
but if that's the case,
why has Nate fallen right off our radar and Serena, as always,
sighted solo?
wonder what she'd do if she knew lonely boy wasn't so lonely anymore.
you know, I-I've been Harris' assistant all summer.
how come I don't know you?
I was at his symposium at the 92nd street in June.
no way. no, if you were there, we would have met.
...and dish up justice.
you considered violence and you considered reconciliation.
how about now...
we can meet whenever you want?
I had my eye on her.
I don't think she noticed, sir.
I read from your favorite chapter.
or did you not notice?
uh, you know, I've heard that chapter so many times,
sometimes I think I wrote it myself.
speaking of, where is that story of yours?
you know, the one your internship requires you turn in?
Yeah, it's, uh, it's imminent. -So is death. Be more specific.
I-I'm just doing a polish. It's basically done.
Noah Shapiro at the "paris review" is looking forward to it.
and calling him was an amazing thing to do for me.
really, thank you.
I told him it would be even better than your piece in the "new yorker.
don't let me down.
Oh, it'll be on your desk first thing in the morning, sir.
why don't you go home and finish now?
Hey! where have you been hiding? -Hey.
thought you asked me to meet you here.
you know what? unfortunately, i-i-i have to go.
rain check for tomorrow?
I'll make it up. I promise. -Okay.
well, well, well, lonely boy.
maybe dating and dumping Serena wasn't such a bad idea.
looks like it's time to give you a new nickname.
how about "playboy"?
people, people, I'm worried.
Eleanor returns next week, and we are still behind.
now since I have to go to that party this weekend, I won't be around,
and therefore, neither will you,
so you better get twice as much work done today, or you will regret it.
as for Little J. , looks like this summer has been all work and no play.
you can't be finished.
there's no way you could possibly be finished.
don't you do anything when you leave here, Ginny?
um, actually,
I was hoping I could show you something I've been working on.
this isn't school. I don't look at your work.
I was an intern once, too. it gets better.
what is that?
Oh, it's a dress I made for the white party.
for the Vitamin Water party?
Mm-hmm. who invited you? oh, lace?
Ugh! it's not even white. it's bone.
it's way too big for you. don't you know how to fit?
it's huge. well, it's not actually for me. it's for you.
um, I'm not going to the party, so...
so you thought I might wear some holly hobbie frock made by an intern so that when I get photographed, your work ends up in "w"?
if I'm gonna wear a custom anything, it's gonna matter.
here's what you asked for, Laurel.
since you did so well with repairing the trim on the dead stock,
match these up.
Oh, and put that away. eggshell gives me a migraine.
well, I guess now's as good a time as any to order dinner.
what do you want? indian? -Oh, it's too hot for indian.
how about popsicles?
Hey. where's mom?
Oh, she and alex had tickets to "South Pacific.
what is that, more homework? -Finish your story yet?
almost. -good.
I'm hoping by reading it that maybe I can
figure out why you and Serena broke up anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah, me, too.
Hey, Jen, I'm gonna head out and get some food.
I'll be back in a bit.
this is the first time I've seen you look in the mirror all summer.
here I thought if you did, you'd turn to stone.
you must be pretty nervous about something if you're willing to take that risk.
ha ha, sis. I'm on my way out to Lily's 'part.
with the triplets returning to New York,
I thought I'd continue my tour of South America.
I'm thinking Argentina. -Then what are the flowers for?
you wouldn't perhaps have overheard a recent phone call with a certain best friend of mine who mentioned she's on her way out here on the jitney?
what's a jitney?
if that's your way of saying no, then I'm glad to hear it,
cause Blair will never forgive you for what you did to her.
who told you that little piece of advice your "boyfriend" Nate?
Nate didn't say anything.
good, 'cause I don't think it's wise taking relationship advice from somebody in a fake relationship.
call me crazy.
enjoy another night alone with your thoughts.
good luck on your suicide mission.
Spotted--Chuck Bass waiting for the jitney a dozen roses in one hand,
his heart in the other.
you know what they say a man is a good thing to come home for,
but an even better thing to come home with.
ain't karma a bitch?
we know Blair Waldorf is.
you didn't do anything all summer?
please don't tell me you just sat around watching "The Closer"
and eating takeout from Nick and Toni's.
no, Della Femina.
what about all those rumors I heard about you and Nate?
Mnh-mnh-mnh. completely untrue.
they just got people off my back about being sad,
and then Nate could do whatever he wanted,
so it worked out for both of us.
you're telling me you didn't have any fun with anyone all summer?
Oh, there was this hot lifeguard that asked me out.
but i, you know, i-i turned him down.
what? are you crazy?
a hot lifeguard is like Kleenex-- use once and throw away.
you couldn't ask for a better rebound.
I don't think I'm ready.
I-I still miss Dan sometimes...
more than sometimes... all the time.
the only thing lamer than dating Dan Humphrey is mourning Dan Humphrey.
and the only reason you're still sitting shivah is because
you haven't gotten back out there and had your summer fling.
Yeah, the triplets esquerda'd,
but not before teaching me some portuguese tongue twisters.
I'll se ya.
James is the classiest guy I've ever met, you know?
he drinks Gin Martinis, and he speaks six languages,
and he gave me this amazing Bulgari Pearl choker with a gold "B" clasp on it.
wait, I thought your dad gave you that. who's James?
Oh, my god, B.
he sounds amazing.
the last time we talked, um... you hadn't even met him.
Oh, I know! he swept me off my feet.
he's so charming. plus, he tells the best stories.
you're lying.
I am not.
your eyes are doing that thing where they don't match your mouth.
I wasn't aware that robots got jealous.
did they update your software while I was away?
come on.
you and I both know this guy's just a prop you bought to try to hurt me like I hurt you.
you didn't hurt me.
well, I will admit,
waiting for you in Tuscany the first few days were mildly humiliating.
but when I realized you weren't gonna show, I rallied.
luckily, I made a friend on the trip over.
boring Ben-- my dad's ex-employee?
by the way, I had him fired just for you.
well, I owe him everything. he introduced me to James.
you know, I think he might be the one.
prove it. -I don't have to prove anything.
but if you want to get to know James better,
I'll bring him to dinner tonight.
I'll bet you'll like him just as much as I do.
Oh, and if by that you mean I won't like him at all then you're right.
I'll see you at 7: 00.
now how about we go find that lifeguard?
but we have to stop at Nate's first.
he has something of mine that I need.
Hey. how's Vermont?
great. Vanessa and her parents were at last night's gig.
I didn't even know she was up here.
when I asked her how Dan was doing, she didn't answer.
I had hoped maybe that she could help him get over Serena this summer.
I don't think Dan needs any help in that department,
and I think Vanessa noticed.
is he still dating up a storm?
well, if you call a different girl every night "dating.
I'm a little worried about him, dad.
is he there?
he's still sleeping. he was out pretty late last night.
have him call me when he wakes up.
Hey, you know, you haven't told me how the dress went over.
Yeah, it's over.
uh, Laurel doesn't want to wear it to the party.
well, why don't you wear it?
dad,
as nice as it is that you're encouraging me to get my designs out there,
the White Party's, like, super exclusive.
I mean, summer interns do not get to go.
last year, they even turned away Jack Johnson.
sounds like a party with taste. -Dad!
also sounds like the kind of party the Van Der Woodsens would go to.
have you asked Eric about it?
Yeah, that might be a little awkward,
considering the last conversation we had.
I sort of said some things I shouldn't have.
you know, maybe I should have just come with you this summer.
Eleanor's been in Paris, like, the entire time,
and Laurel's been so worried about everything.
what if it was a waste?
it's not a waste if there's time to change it.
maybe you should start with Eric and then go from there.
Thanks, dad. see you Sunday? -You know it.
okay, bye.
not today, kid.
it's all right, Joe. he's with me.
my sorry to interrupt you while you're working.
you wouldn't be interrupting if you'd shown up on time.
something tells me you're here empty-handed.
all I need is, uh, one--one more day.
what, the last 60 weren't good enough?
I'm sorry, sir, but I... -Don't sit. you're not staying.
you told me you were serious about writing.
I-I know. I tried to write.
I did.
but every time I sat down it's just, there was something in the way.
I couldn't focus.
excuses are for the unemployed of which you are now one.
if you won't do your homework, then neither will I.
you'll get no letter of recommendation from me.
W-working for you is very important to me.
your action goes straight only the opposite.
drop my spare key in the mail.
that I'm sure you have time to do.
if it's apology time, you're about three months late.
Eric, wait... -And let me guess. you want something.
Yeah, you're right.
um, does it help that the new me just answered that honestly?
not really.
look, I know I acted like a complete and total raging bitch last year.
but what you don't know is how bad I felt about it all summer.
you were the only person that was friends with me for me,
and I hurt you the worst.
well, you did get yours in the end.
and since it's not like I have many fries myself,
I guess I could use every lying, manipulating, backstabbing one I can get.
What'd you have in mind?
well, do you happen to be in the Hamptons right now?
Ooh. a honk instead of a knock.
did someone order a townie?
Oh, god.
the lifeguard's got a camaro,
and not in an ironic "i've got a camaro" way.
just go already. luck?
Yeah. you, too. mwah.
Hey, and if anybody asks, I'm out with Nate, okay?
I still don't understand what that's about, but okay.
where is he tonight anyway? -I don't know. bye.
I'm sorry I couldn't see you all day.
he just got away from me.
Oh, god. I wish the summer wasn't ending.
I forgot how much fun it is.
well, lots of people have affairs that last year-round.
Yeah, but I can't get caught.
I can be really sneaky.
sneaky is cute at your age.
a couple decades later, not so much.
Mmm. can we talk about this later?
if I'm so cute, let's talk about this now.
why don't I do something that shuts you up?
so, James, did you have a chance to meet Harold and, uh...
what is his boyfriend's name again?
uh, Roman? only briefly at the chateau.
although cat didn't seem to like me nearly as much.
I have the scars to prove it.
you certainly have crammed an awful lot into such a short time together.
I wonder,
has Blair had a chance to share her favorite movies with you yet?
"tiffany's," "roman holiday" and of course, "charade."
Oh, I thought your third favorite was "funny face."
it is. I hate "charade." Chuck, stop harassing him.
Yeah, uh, how well do you know Blair Waldorf?
is kind a boring for those of us who actually know Blair Waldorf.
not to mention transparent. well, thank you, grandma.
why is it when you say that word it sounds like an insult?
no, no, i-i don't mind.
I would like to learn as much as I can about Blair,
and there's no better way to learn than through a quiz.
well, it's a shame you guys took a bus and not a limo.
I don't know if you know this, but Blair loves a limo-- sweetie,
will you please pass me the salt and pepper?
excuse me.
I think I just lost my appetite.
will you excuse me?
Chuck.
look, I know what that pin means to you.
you gave it to Nate the first time you said you loved him.
well, I asked for it back.
I thought James should have it now.
do you, uh...
really feel the same way about him as you did Nate?
I do.
I'll see you at school.
Oh, my goodness.
my pin must have gotten caught on your sweater by mistake.
Oh, wow. I didn't feel anything.
neither did i.
well, Nathaniel, you have a choice-- under the bed or out the window
what?
my husband just pulled up. your husband?
I thought he wasn't supposed to be home till next week.
seems he's home early.
whoa. Nate?
what the hell's his deal? I have no idea.
damn that mother-Chucker.
Ugh! he--he's totally right. I don't even like James.
thank you. I was waiting for that.
I only hooked up with him a week ago because
I knew that I couldn't get off the plane alone.
and it would kill me if Chuck knew that he'd ruined my summer.
Oh, b. I'm so sorry.
was it really bad?
I would be in my cabana at the hotel and there he would be.
amid all the fireworks on bastille day,
all I could see was that Chuck Bass-tard.
the limo's taking me back in an hour.
you're welcome to join me. dude, you're not going to the white party?
come on. pretty girls, white dresses.
unless there's a sprinkler, I don't care.
besides, it's tourist season in the city. easy pickings. ah.
okay, and I don't want Blair throwing her callboy in my face.
at least I could have gotten a more interesting stand-in than James.
do you know how hard it is to find a good fake boyfriend on short notice?
well, he was smart and fun at tea yesterday, and he's really cute, too.
you don't have to lie anymore, Serena. he served his purpose.
now that Chuck is on his way back to the city,
I can dump James just in time to go to the white party stag.
how was your date, by the way?
after a few hours with that guy, I needed life saving, not guarding.
Babysteps, smothery, Babysteps by the way, Archibald, now that the summer's over,
I can tell you I never believed any of the talk that you hit it with my sis.
good morning, Waldorf.
it was until now
Nate, why don't you call me back this morning.
I can't talk about that here.
so where's princeton? I'm surprised you let him get away.
James goes to georgetown, and unlike you,
I don't lose something if I let it out of my sight.
when you told me you secret girlfriend was older,
I thought you meant Coege.
not to mention, Catherine's married.
I don't know where you've been, but your boy toy is a princeton man.
he and I talked about it while you played dress up with serena last night.
Catherine ended it with me last night.
what? tell me. you misheard, Chuck.
he's always going on and on about his crew division and his eating club.
it's georgetown all the way.
I know he said princeton.
Georgetown. princeton.
Georgetown. Serena, let's go.
well, I'm glad to hear you're not seeing Catherine anymore.
we can talk about it later.
Eric, it's me. you were at dinner last night.
what college does Blair's consort go to?
Yeah, well, that's not what he told Blair.
do some research, junior. I'm in the mood to be right.
I can't believe that I get a job working for my literary idol,
and he--and he cans me, you know?
I did everything he asked from picking up his dry cleaning to keeping him sober before noon, which was, believe me,
the hardest thing I've ever done.
harder than finishing that story?
I just couldn't write it, dad. i-i-i don't know why.
you're talking to a guy who couldn't finish a new song in 12 years.
I get it.
so what is the story about anyway?
the dissolution of a relationship between two people from different worlds.
science fiction, huh? yeah.
well, if I can offer some fatherly advice from 300 miles away...
I-I haven't finished the story because I haven't dealt with my feelings over the way I ended it with Serena.
couldn't have said it better myself, even if you'd let me.
I've tried not to think about her all summer.
I was afraid if I did,
that I would-- I would see that I made a huge mistake.
so I've just been trying to distract myself the best I can.
well, you've been running all summer.
maybe it's time you stopped, and you turned around and faced it.
so not only did james schiller not go to princeton,
he also didn't go to georgetown.
in fact, I couldn't find a record of him at any of the big schools.
since when did you become sherlock holmes?
so you think James is-- an untalented mr. ripley?
if you want entrees in upper class.
there's no easier mark than a wronged woman.
it's time to call in the big guns.
Mike, I need a background check on a james schiller...
he's got a p. i. on speed dial.
Nate! I know that face. that face is not your friend.
my grandmother just informed me you told her I'm gonna be your date to the white party this evening?
if things are really over with Catherine,
then why do I still need to be your cover? huh?
James...
the past six days have been exactly what I needed them to be.
me, too. and there's something I've-- me first.
sorry.
Oh, what is it? what did you want to say?
I just wanted to ask if you'd like to come to the white party with me tonight.
sure. that--that'd be great.
I know I shouldn't have used you again after our conversation this morning.
no, I get it. you have feelings for her.
but let's just be honest about why you wanna go tonight.
you wanna check out the competition.
no.
I just--i-i wanna see her and her husband together...
just once.
Yeah, that's called checking out the competition,
which is stupid and potentially dangerous, Nate.
Yeah, you're right.
but since I've been stupid and dangerous in the past, i...
I'm not one to talk, am i?
it--it was probably gonna be an uneventful evening anyway.
pick me up at 5: 00.
sometimes the stars align for two old friends to come together.
but sometimes they lign for two old flames to totally combust.
Hey, uh, 14 sandpiper lane? yeah, yeah.
you go there? all right.
wonder what the sky holds for s. tonight-- friendship or fireworks?
Hey, thanks again for giving me another chance.
thanks for being worthy of it.
you know you're on probation, right?
Yeah.
I think you guys all look great. I ju
please tell everyone I said hi. all right, bye.
can you excuse me a moment?
trying to ruin my marriage?
get me drunk?
Absolutely.
Daniel humphrey
I can honestly say I'm surprised.
is--is Serena here?
no, she's gone ahead to a party that I'm quite late for myself.
uh, could you... please?
Oh--oh, yeah. sure.
Yeah, if you really want me to.
there you go.
thank you.
Oh, you--you seem, uh...
I-I don't know, you seem different.
well, certain things are in remission,
Mr. Humphrey, not the least of which is my former attitude.
going through something like I did changes you.
you can see things differently. yeah? like, uh, like what?
like how the keys to someone else's happiness
are not necessarily the same ones as for your own.
Serena thinks she had me fooled this summer, but I know the truth.
you are still in her heart.
are--are you sure I'm at the right house?
this party that you're about to take me to-- it has a very strict dress code.
and all of that is to say what I wanted to talk to you about earlier,
is that my feelings for you have deepened, and i...
I can't help thinking that what I've done is something so terrible, -So inappropriate -you're so funny!
I'm--I'm sorry.
I could just listen to you all day.
did i--did I say something funny?
Hi. Vitamin Water?
what kind would you like?
uh, "rescue," please? -okay.
make that two.
you got it.
so, Ginny...
how did you manage to get in, and in that dress?
you know, I checked at the door, and your name's not on the list,
and they said you were someone's plus-one.
but I told them that someone like you couldn't possibly know anyone here.
Oh, look.
actually, here's someone I know coming right now.
Jenny, this is Tinsley Mormer, a friend of my mom's.
tinsley, this is my friend Jenny I told you about.
and that's Laurel.
it's so nice to meet you, Jenny.
it's nice to meet you, too.
I have a look book of photos from magazines that I cut out and you're in, like, all of them.
you have amazing taste.
that is so sweet. thank you.
you know, Eric said you're an aspiring designer.
are you wearing one of your own pieces?
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.
is something wrong?
you've been using me to make that guy jealous.
I have not. -it's no wonder you hate "charade."
it hits too close to home.
you don't understand. Chuck is an awful person.
he does terrible things. he uses people.
and... you think you're any different?
I can't believe I've been so stupid.
I bet you don't even like me at all.
no, not really.
I mean...
you're kind of boring.
am i?
or are you just too interested in yourself to get to know me?
you two deserve each other.
you really know how to hurt people.
I admire you for it. -This is all your fault.
I would have never needed a James if you hadn't stood me up at the airport in the first place.
you made me use him. I didn't make you do anything.
you were just you. don't you see? we're the same.
stop trying to fight it.
I will fight until my last dying breath,
because any resemblance to you is something I would hate about myself.
come on. cheer up, Charlie.
what are you still doing here?
what did she just say to you?
she just asked me what I'm still doing here. -oh, that's it.
she's officially not invited to book club next summer.
I don't even know what I was thinking.
no, don't feel bad.
it's her fault for getting things started with you in the first place.
Oh, I know, but it was stupid.
I just wish I could make her feel as badly as I feel right now.
you totally can.
Spotted--Serena and Nate in a massive display of p. d.a...
of course.
and that's exactly what Dan Humphrey is-- pretty damn angry.
no, no, no, Dan, Dan, wait.
no, thank you.
no, i-i didn't expect to see you.
you--you completely surprised me.
I-- well, I have to say you didn't.
Nate, huh? I guess even bad history repeats itself.
no, it--it's not what it looks like.
let me guess-- there's an explanation? -yes. of course.
I was just trying to help him make someone jealous. -who?
well, i-i can't say. -why not?
Oh, well, I'm sure you can't tell me that either.
no, I can't, but that's not the point.
no, that's exactly the point.
it can never just be a simple answer with you.
it can't just be "i kissed Nate.
it has to be "i-i kissed Nate because someone I can't name needed to see it for a reason I can't explain.
it's the same drama, different city.
Hi. what are you doing here?
I came with a date. I'm glad I did...
because since I know her date, the two of us got to meet.
Yeah, and then we got to talking,
and we figured out that the other night at Jeremiah Harris' reading,
when you were making out with me...
you were supposed to be with me.
no, wait. no, no, let me guess-- you can explain?
Catherine. what are you doing? Why did you kiss serena?
you said we were through.
I can't believe that you would try to make me jealous in front of my husband and our friends.
well, did it work? -completely.
so i... i-i-i went a little overboard.
a little? yeah. it's true, I did.
and I hate that I'm even able to say this, but that's, um,
that's not the first time something like that has happened.
I, uh...
I haven't been able to get you out of my head all summer.
I-I was hoping when I saw you,
I would know that we did the right thing,
but i-i don't feel that way.
I don't feel that way at all.
can we not talk about this right now?
right now I just need to make sure my grandfather's suit from the '70s isn't ruined forever... yeah.
more than it already was by being my grandfather's suit from the '70s.
I miss that little laugh of yours.
shh, just...
okay.
when words get in the way, there's really only one thing left to do...
let's get out of here.
you wanna get out of here? yes.
I just have to say good-bye to, um, a few dozen people first.
um, do you want to-- yeah, I'll--i'll-- I'll meet you at the beach.
I'll wait there. okay.
you were right.
I used you as a weapon against Chuck.
I didn't need you to be interesting, so I didn't listen when you talked.
I just needed you to look good...
which you do.
just in time.
what's the dirt on non-James schiller?
I'm afraid we have something in common.
well, I look good, too.
uh, not just that.
um, it's what I was trying to tell you earlier.
I haven't been honest with you.
okay, spill it.
I don't go to georgetown or princeton or any school for that matter.
I'm afraid I slipped up on that detail.
my name...
is actually Marcus Beaton.
I'm british...
and a lord.
what?
well, why didn't you tell me before?
well, most women I meet only like me for my title.
I vowed the next time to pretend to be a common American and see what happened.
but after a couple of days with you, I was afraid if I told you the truth,
you'd hate me for lying in the first place.
no, not quite, my lord.
um, the title is great and all,
but what I'd like more than anything is a little honesty for a change...from both of us.
when you told me I was boring before?
no one ever tells me things like that.
I liked it.
tell me...
Oh, what else do you think about me?
keep talking in that accent, and I'll come up with something.
so...
I hear Tinsley offered to help you find an internship if you want one.
Yeah, she did.
I said thanks, but I'm actually learning a lot where I am right now.
I didn't think it was right to leave just yet.
well, enjoy the rest of your weekend...Jenny.
I'll see you monday? I look forward to it.
do you think she meant any of that?
no, probably not, but at least she knows my name now, right?
Chuck.
aren't you done trying to destroy my night?
look, I should never have abandoned you.
I knew I made the wrong decision as soon as your plane took off.
I distracted myself all summer hoping I wouldn't feel it, but I still do.
And?
I was scared...
scared that if we spent the whole summer together, just us...
you'd see...
see what?
me.
please don't leave with him.
Why?
give me a reason, and "i'm Chuck Bass" doesn't count.
because you don't want to.
not good enough.
cause I don't want you to. that's not enough.
what else is there?
the true reason I should stay right where I am and not get in the car.
three words.
eight letters.
say it, and I'm yours.
I...
I...
thank you.
that's all I needed to hear.
they say summer love is fleeting,
but sometimes, what starts as a fling can lead to the real thing.
a simple trip to the beach could be all it takes to clear our heads and open our hearts and write a new ending to an old story.
there are those who got burned by the heat.
they just want to forget and start over...
while there are others who want each moment to last forever.
but everyone can agree on one thing-- tans fade, highlights go dark,
and we all get sick of sand in our shoes.
but the end of summer is the beginning of a new season,
so we find ourselves looking to the future.
you ain't seen nothing yet.
gossip girl here--your once and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's life.
waiting for you in Tuscany the first few days were mildly humiliating.
but when I realized you weren't gonna show, I rallied.
luckily, I made a friend on the trip over.
my name is actually Marcus Beaton.
I'm british and a lord.
please don't leave with him.
you're telling me you didn't have any fun with anyone all summer?
I don't think I'm ready. I-I still miss Dan sometimes.
well, I've just been trying to distract myself the best I can.
I was hoping when I saw you, I would know that we did the right thing.
but I-I don't feel that way. I don't feel that way at all.
what about all those rumors I heard about you and Nate? Completely untrue.
they just got people off my back about being sad.
and then Nate could do whatever he wanted.
when you told me your secret girlfriend was older,
I thought you meant college.
not to mention, Catherine's married.
I just wish I could make her feel as badly as I feel right now.
you totally can.
I can't believe that you would try to make me jealous in front of my husband and our friends. well, did it work?
completely.
I haven't been able to get you out of my head all summer.
as summer comes to an end,I'd like to share a few of the things I've learned about fun in the sun.
gossip girl's guide to summer, "tip number one-- don't fall asleep on the job."
the best hookups are free of morning breath and awkward conversation.
the only thing harder than making up is waking up.
morning.
what?
I'm sorry. I-I'm just a little, um...
overwhelmed?
confused.
last night was...
it was amazing.
and confusing.
okay. now I'm-- I'm a little confused.
well, it was so romantic what you did, showing up here.
and it feels so right to be together.
but you're having second thoughts.
No.I-I just think that we should think...
before we get back together, right?
y-yeah, I mean, I thought-- I thought this meant we were back together.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
no, you're not.
no, I'm not at all.
and neither am I, and--and I want to keep it that way.
but this is a big decision, and--and we did break up for a reason...
many reasons.
but this was never our problem.
I will see you back in the city...
Mmm. fully clothed...
with lots of people around. okay?
we'll talk.
Yeah, about our problems.
that sounds great.
summer tip number two-- there's no "we" in summer, only "u" and "me."
find out where you stand before you find yourself stood up.
anyone can canoodle in july and august, but will he be gone by september?
so what's next?
I was thinking breakfast-- a little french toast, some coffee.
no.
I mean, since you don't go to Princeton or Georgetown,
I assume you're not headed back to college.
so where are you headed? are you staying here?
would it be too forward of me to say I'll go wherever you go?
I'd be honored, milord.
Blair, you don't have to call me that.
in fact, you shouldn't-- I know. Don't worry.
I was up all night reading "Debrett's Peerage."
I'm well versed in your lordly ways, and I'm ready to meet the queen,
which I also watched on DVD, b.t.w.
well, I can see that you are quite prepared.
as you've probably guessed, I have to get back to the city.
senior year awaits.
Mm. Let me think.
a beautiful girl, autumn in New York.
well, I think I could find some way to entertain myself. Really?
Absolutely. My family will be glad I'm staying in one place for a while.
Oh, your family. I'd love to meet the duke and duchess.
Duchess. Right. W-well, we'll see.
will you excuse me for a moment?
things are going south with Lord Marcus.
who's Lord Marcus? James.
it turns out that he was only pretending to be a commoner.
it's like "Roman Holiday,"
only I'm Gregory Peck, and he's Audrey Hepburn.
Oh, suddenly it's all so clear.
he's not really a college student.
he's a lord, and I love him.
okay, I'm gonna take your word for it, but, Blair, love?
like, very much.
and not just because Tom Hanks gave him a kleenex at lady DI's funeral.
and you really expect me to believe this isn't all about revenge on Chuck?
revenge is so 12 hours ago,
and just because Marcus happens to be the perfect post-Bass.
palate cleanser doesn't mean he isn't a delicious dish in his own right.
okay, so it sounds like you guys are soul mates.
what exactly is the problem? He's being vague about the future.
Marcus. Hey.
Hello, Chuck. I was just getting something to eat.
do you mind if I join you? I do, yes. Uh, I'm dining with Blair.
and I feel I should tell you, I know you two have a history.
around here, who doesn't? But you're with Blair now.
I get that. There's no reason we can't be civil.
after all, isn't that a trait your people pride themselves on?
right.
well, for England then.
shall we?
we shall.
wait, you just found out this guy's real identity.
I think it's a little soon to be worrying about the rest of your lives.
but not the rest of the year.
it's the season for flings-- tennis pros and townies. I'm his secret summer shame.
Blair Waldorf--a fling?
hmm. You're not exactly low maintenance.
speaking of, where were you last night?
did the lifeguard turn up at the party,
or did you find another disposable?
uh, sorry, Blair. I have to go.
wait. Serena!
Hi. Hey, I thought you were gonna... I thought you'take the train.
take the--the train. Yeah. But you're taking the jitney. Me, too.
I-I was--I was just gonna use some of that downtime to do some of the thinking that we talked about. And you should, you know, just 'cause,
um, we're not gonna make out.
it doesn't mean we have to totally avoid each other. Yeah, right. Well, we're-- it's not like we're-- wee animals.
I think--I think we can share the same bus without, uh,
R-running off together.
I'm gonna sit over here. I'll be here.
and that's me.
fantastic. I'll call you. please.
and, uh... Chuck, what are you doing in my chair?
Oh, we've got a date to play squash at Chuck's father's club.
Charles, sidebar.
actually, we weren't finished.
notice how my voice didn't go up at the end? Not a question.
squash? I'll squash you.
it's just a game, Blair.
not to me, bass-hole. I like him.
and so do I, and apparently, he doesn't have too many friends.
Chuck just informed me that he and Serena are leaving immediately.
do you think I could catch a ride back into town with you?
of course.
Hey, mom. It's looking really nice out here.
Thanks. I couldn't sleep, so I got up early.
are you going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm gonna head back into the city, actually.
but there's still a few more days of vacation. Yeah, I know.
I figured it'd be good to get back in and settled before school starts.
I mean, Louisa's at the house, right?
it's--it's not a big deal. No.
I haven't wanted to tell you this,
but you're going to find out soon enough.
find out what?
the federal prosecutor has taken your father's leaving town as an admission of guilt.
they want to forfeit our assets for restitution.
what, they wanna take our money?
well, not yet, but they have frozen our accounts.
and now they're making an inventory of everything that we own.
I asked your granddad for help. What, you told grandpa?
not that it did any good.
as you can imagine,
he's not very happy with my role in your father's departure.
for the time being at least, I've been cut off.
I can't believe you knew all this, and you didn't say anything.
all summer, I kept hoping I could make it go away, and maybe I still can,
which is why I need you to keep your chin up and trust that your mother's got this handled.
no, when he left, dad told me to take care of you. And you are.
Nate, let's not fight about this, please.
tip number three-- take time to smell the flowers.
mom, I gotta go. Let's talk about this later, okay?
it's true that all good things must come to an end,
and august is no exception.
they don't call it "fall" for nothing.
Hey, this is Nate. Please leave a message.
Nate, it's Catherine.
listen, last night was not smart.
in fact, it was very, very stupid, which is why we're gonna have to be much more clever when we get back to the city. Call me when you get this.
Oh. Darling.
Duchess, you weren't home when I packed up.
just wanted to say good-bye to you and dad before I left.
well, your father's run up to boston till tomorrow,
but I'm sure he sends his love.
listen, I'll see you in the city for dinner.
I want to hear all about your summer. And me, yours.
see you then.
Ah. Manhattan, here we come.
cheers to that, Blair.
nothing says "welcome home" like a bottle of bubbly...
ready?
Aah! and a scandal bubbling.
sorry. Um, I'm done reading my magazine...
Oh. and I know that you like the music reviews, so if you want to read it, you can.
thank you.
want one?
Oh, no thanks. I'm good.
I'm sorry.
it's okay.
so? what are your plans later?
I mean, besides racquet sports with your new friend Chuck?
Oh, the duchess was hoping we'd get dinner.
dinner? I'd love to have dinner with your mother.
Oh, she's my stepmother, actually,
not that this makes her an any less forceful presence in my life.
but I meant we are having dinner--she and I.
we haven't seen each other much all summer, so...
Oh. Of course. I understand.
it's just...
you'll be missing my big party.
you're having a party?
I can't believe I didn't mention it.
every year I have a big "welcome back to the city" party for all my friends.
it's only my favorite event of the year.
then I'll tell the duchess we'll catch up another time.
you don't have to, but thank you.
no offense, but don't you think you're a little outmatched?
at squash?
I've been playing my father since the eighth grade.
how good can Marcus be? No, I mean, as a guy.
Blair wants to be a princess,
and your greatest achievement is owning part of a burlesque club.
which is why I have to get to know him.
see, no one's that perfect.
once I get him out of the way, then I'll have a clear shot at Blair.
Oh, you know it's love when you start talking like an assassin.
I think you're jealous of my new best friend.
well, I have been hoping someone would tag in for a while now.
Hello?
uh, I can't talk right now.
I'll have to call you when I'm home.
Hey, if you need to work out the details of your takedown, don't let me stop you. -You know me well, but it's nothing.
it's still kind of a mess, but I think you get the idea.
well?
you're being very quiet.
is that good quiet or bad quiet?
come on. I'm freaking out.
I'm freaking out.
this place is amazing. People might actually come here.
that was the idea.
I know, but when I talked about converting our storage space into a cafe,
I was thinking of a folding table and a coffeemaker.
Vanessa, thank you. This is a great homecoming present.
it's exactly what I needed.
what you needed for what? Aren't you happy to be home?
Yeah, of course.
I can't wait till the kids get back from the hamptons.
I miss 'em like crazy.
and they miss you, too, but...
no buts. I had a great time this summer.
I had forgotten what it was like to be on the road,
performing for a live audience night after night.
and now that you remember...
I'm grateful for the memory.
now does this place actually serve coffee or what?
Yes, it does.
uh, to go, please.
I need to head downtown.
one house blend, on the house.
and see what else you can find upstairs then. Excuse me.
you Nate Archibald? Yeah.
since this is my house, how about I ask the questions?
don't worry. your family's lawyer is upstairs, supervising.
supervising what, exactly?
us.
we've moved into your house,
and we're going through every single thing your family owns.
Wow. You're actually enjoying this, aren't you?
look, no one wants to hold a yard sale.
we want your father locked up.
no, we already told the prosecutors we don't know where he is.
that's too bad.
we'll deal with it. Maybe you will.
but after spending so much time in your mom's closet,
I feel like I know the lady.
I don't think she'll adjust so well.
Hi. It's Catherine. Leave a message.
Hey. It's me. Uh, listen, I really need to talk to someone.
so, um, I need to talk to you.
so if you can call me, please.
something tells me you're off your game.
anything I can help with?
uh, no one can help.
you sure?
well, it's the duchess. You know how it is.
tell me.
no one's ever good enough.
I've dated a lot of topflight girls, and she always sends them running.
it's like--and she gets inside their heads,
figures out their worst fears and just--- ruthlessly exploits that fear.
it's rough.
not to mention, she's completely got my father's ear.
of course, Blair is desperate to meet her.
and when Blair sets her mind on something...
exactly.
that's a match.
I'd say let's keep at it, but I have to get ready for Blair's party.
party? Right.
Thanks, Chuck. We should do this again.
see you at the Hudson.
perfect.
and, uh, there was a problem with your cell earlier.
why don't I get your home number? Yeah, sure.
Spotted--Chuck Bass putting his new b.f.f.on speed dial.
is it the beginning of a beautiful bro-mance...
that was a good match. You nearly had me.
or the end of Blair's bid to be british?
well done, Dorota. I like what I'm seeing.
now make the library the sky terrace, the ranunculus dahlias,
the veuve clicquot laurent-pierre, and I think we have ourselves a party.
thank you, Miss Blair.
this guest list, however, is a complete page one.
but those are your friends.
then invite strangers.
I have to present myself as a crown jewel, surrounded by other smaller, slightly flawed gems, but quality stones nonetheless.
and try to round up a couple people who can vote.
so it doesn't feel like a total high school party.
a party at the Hudson, huh? I got your message.
since when are you having a party?
since it became clear that Marcus does not think I'm worthy of meeting his family. Oh, my god.
obviously I have some more work to do.
B. you don't have to do this. Yes, I do.
Marcus dated the descendant of Princess Grace.
his consort needs to be able to host royal dinners and hobnob with oligarchs and dictators.
well, if you can't find common ground with a dictator,
I don't know who can. Dan likes soccer, right?
or "football," as Marcus calls it.
you think it'd be too weird if he came? Um, no, not necessarily.
good.
you'll call him?
wait, so does this mean you actually think Dan has a redeeming quality?
as long as he knows his arse from his arsenal, I think he's aces.
well, this could be a good opportunity for us to get together and talk.
you know, I have been thinking about the breakup-- ugh!
what is to think about?
you're finally free from downer Dan, and I have my old Serena back.
so come on. There's lots of work to do.
Nate.
Hey. Look, could I, uh, could I talk to you for a second?
I'm actually in the middle of something. Oh. Do you have a girl here?
I mean, what about your devotion to Blair?
it's not a girl. It's business.
I'm, uh, liquidating my shares in Victrola.
wait, you're selling the club? But you love that place.
Chuck, if you're trying to impress Blair...
I mean, come on. Look, what you said in the limo was right.
if I'm gonna compete with this guy, I have to rise to his level.
Yeah, but don't you think that's a little extreme?
maybe, but given the situation, it's the right thing to do.
and, uh, I should probably get back to it.
the sooner I get it done, the sooner I can brag about it to Blair.
okay. all right. I, um, I'll see ya.
Yeah. What's going on?
what are you up to right now?
is this gonna take much longer?
I told Mrs. Archibald we could have it done by tonight.
Hey. Hey. It's me. Hey, you. Did you get my message?
Yeah.
Yeah, and listen, before you say anything else, I just want to let you know that, uh, this morning, on the--on the bus...
Yeah, we didn't exactly stick to the plan, did we?
well, uh, no. The plan was deeply flawed.
I think we overestimated our powers of restraint...
or, uh, I-I-I did, at least.
Yeah, me, too, but then I realized something.
Yeah, me, too. Really?
Yeah, well, uh...
I-I think if we want to figure anything out for real, you know,
WE--WE--WE do need to take some time... alone.
sure.
Yeah, um, but Blair's not gonna like that.
Blair?
Yeah, it's actually why I called.
your knowledge of premier league football is integral to one of her schemes.
she just wants you to come to a party. A party?
Yeah, well, I'll be there, and I really wanna see you.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we can start with the new plan tomorrow.
you know,
they're obviously just trying to scare us to get us to rat out my dad.
you do know where he is, right?
Yeah, but...
I couldn't.
even after everything he's done.
just had to put it out there.
but if the worst-case scenario comes true,
I promise my sister and I will give your mom some good pointers on how to do more with less.
I'd love to see that.
the salvation army's having a bag sale on saturday,
and Ruby knows this place in the village that has two-for-one taco night.
stop it.
it's lesbian-mexican. Sometimes their band plays there.
um, just one second, okay?
Hey, mom.
Hey, Nate.
I just wanted to apologize for scaring you this morning.
it turns out I was able to fix things after all.
how? Yyou didn't tell them where dad is, did you?
of course not.
I just got a loan from a family friend.
from who? That doesn't matter.
but I just find it hard to believe that you opened up to one of the book club ladies and told them we're completely broke.
he's not in book club. He's outside of my regular circle.
Oh, so you just asked someone you barely know for money? - I didn't ask.
he offered, and when I tried to refuse,
he insisted that it was the right thing to do. The right thing to do?
you said he's outside of your regular circle?
is he in mine?
Nate, please stop it. Let me do this.
okay, fine. I won't bring it up again.
everything okay?
no, actually, it's not. Look, I gotta go.
I'll come back later tonight, but I have to find Chuck first.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, the place looks great.
I'm so glad I called you.
I really missed you this summer.
Thanks.
me, too.
Charles bass?
I'm sorry.
I wasn't expecting anyone so young or so beautiful.
just because I didn't give birth to Marcus, doesn't mean I'm any less interested in his well-being.
I don't usually take meetings with children, Charles,
so what do you have to say for yourself?
plenty.
lordy, lordy, look who's 40-- or at least a well-preserved 38.
we knew Chuck had a thing for older women,
but is this risky business or strictly business?
wasn't that wonderful?
thank you, Ingrid and Beatrice.
I'm Ingrid. She's Beatrice.
that's what I said.
Ah! I just love mozart.
uh, that wasn't mozart.
come, come.
Blair, who are these people?
Dorota invited them.
uh, no-- Dan, hi! I'm sorry.
come meet the lord. Okay.
uh, h-hello, lord. I'm Dan Humphrey.
Marcus beaton. Nice to meet you, Dan.
do--do you know Serena?
I do.
he does.
Dan is a football fanatic.
he's a huge Chelsea fan.
Oh, me, too. I just love the Balenciaga store.
freshen your drink?
Mm. Yes, please.
so, uh...
sh-she actually refers to him as "the lord"?
I'm so glad you're here.
Chuck.
the name's Dan.
no, Chuck's here, and Blair didn't invite him.
maybe he's her plus-one.
what are you doing here? Blair.
that's Nate's...
mom's friend.
um, I have to go. I'll be back.
I thought you might like to meet my friend.
Why? So she can warn me about the effects of too much tox?
Blair, is it?
I'm duchess Beaton.
the duchess?
the duchess?
nice to meet you.
a little soon for flowers, no?
just a few finishing touches.
a much better job than I could've ever done.
you just weren't here to do it.
sure, but you were.
how would you like to continue?
Why? Where have you been all day?
I, uh, had a meeting with Tanya Donelly.
she has a college tour coming up.
another tour?
what do Dan and Jenny think?
well, before I ask them, I wanted to see if it was even possible.
Alison's open to coming back for a while longer,
but I know that summer's over, and you've got your schoolwork.
Yeah, homeschooling really ties me up.
if, however,
you're asking if I don't mind sticking around while you're away,
it's not exactly brain surgery.
but are you really sure you wanna leave so soon?
well, if I'm honest, I'm not sure what I want.
this was supposed to be my chance to get it all out of my system.
but I didn't know how much I missed it.
I'm not done.
Wow. That is honest.
well, whatever you decide, I loved fixing up the place,
and I'd be happy to stick around.
just let me know.
Thanks.
come on. If you really like him, just apologize.
what good will it do me now?
Duchess?
I am so sorry about what I said about the botox.
your work is flawless.
look, I know you're here with Chuck,
and I can only imagine what he's said about me-- limo sex,
social torture of freshmen, blackmail.
but I assure you, there is an explanation for all of it.
save your breath, Blair.
Chuck didn't tell me a thing.
Oh. He didn't?
wait. He--he didn't? I told him not to bother.
none of it makes any difference to me,
because nothing will change the fact that despite your best efforts-- which are completely transparent, by the way-- Marcus is never going to end up with a lowly Waldorf.
Nate.
Nate? Catherine?
you two know each other?
no. No, no, no. Yeah, well, just from book club this summer.
but that's it. They've had no other personal contact.
uh, Blair's dating Catherine's stepson.
and, Catherine, Nate's Blair's ex.
what's this?
Chuck's date and Blair's date are mother and son,
and Nate and Blair are exes, and Nate and the mother are in a book club?
now there's a novel plot twist.
this party's a complete bust.
my whole life's a bust.
well, it serves you right.
you were scheming to convince Marcus you're someone you're not.
but my intentions were good.
I really do like him. I just...
as soon as I knew he liked me,
I would have relaxed and dropped the manipulative plotting, and devoted myself to being the best girlfriend ever.
see? Thank you.
there's my b.
show this girl to Catherine, and she'll want you to be with Marcus.
this is you. Just be yourself.
she made "Waldorf" rhyme with "Spears."
I may as well have gone commando and held my party at Nyla's burger basket.
fine.
while you stand here and feel sorry for yourself and denigrate the fine people of Kentwood, I'm gonna go find Dan.
cheer up.
I can't believe you'd do this to me.
bring the Duchess to Blair's party? What do you care?
no, I know about the money.
Nate...
no. You weren't trying to sell Victrola to impress Blair.
you did it to loan my family money?
look, you say it like it's a bad thing.
no, and maybe you were just doing it to be a friend,
but I would never let you do that, and you knew that,
which is why you didn't tell me. Yes, it is. So what?
so what? You go behind my back and make a deal with my mom?
she called me to see if I thought you were okay.
I didn't know what she was talking about,
because you didn't tell me anything was wrong.
I'll tell you what's wrong-- my best friend lying to my face.
look, normally, I would agree with you.
but for your mom to open up to me about something like this,
I'll handle it, okay? How?
Dan, hey. You leaving?
Yeah, I have to get Jenny from the train.
I-I didn't know if you were coming back, so... how about coming with you?
why don't we get out of here?
who are we kidding?
what do you say we just forget thinking and follow our hearts?
are you sure that's your heart you're following? 'cause...
shut up, or I'll change my mind.
Hey, clearly, there are other forces at work here in the universe, so...
Mmm. Forces much more powerful than us.
I'm glad we had this little talk.
Oh, are you two back together or...
uh, uh, no. This was just a little, uh, friendly-- kiss, yeah. Mm-hmm.
okay. Are you coming?
in library, come meet me.
uh, no, no. You guys, uh, you guys should go ahead.
Oh. Good.
cause, uh, this elevator's gonna be in use.
Hey. This is so messed up.
your ex dating my stepson? Yes, it is.
but I actually do know you, Nate.
that isn't what's bothering you.
well, I think I'm starting to get it, you know,
how things are gonna be now that the summer's over.
I mean,
it would be kind of nice to have someone who could actually be there.
but when the best version of the situation is that I'm gonna become Blair's father-in-law?
I think it's just time to move on, Catherine. No, wait, Nate.
come on, I'm here now, and I want to talk.
just tell me what's going on.
Hey, dad. It's me.
um, I talked to Dan, so he's gonna pick me up at the train station.
so I'll just see you at home, but--oh, my god! Stop it!
sorry, dad. I gotta go kick eric's ass in a water fight.
love you. Bye.
Yeah. Hey, Tanya. It's me--Rufus.
I think Anne Archibald would rather die than lose her house, her things.
they're her whole identity.
that's why I'm not gonna let that happen.
I'll find a way. -God, but it's not what she's gonna have to live without.
it's what she's gonna have to live with.
I mean, a scandal will destroy her.
can you imagine her watching her house seized,
her grandmother's jewels up for auction?
I told you, I'll figure something out.
I can handle this. I just need some time.
you can take care of this...
with my help.
it'd just be between you and me. No one would have to know.
I care about you, Nate. I would do it for you.
and what would I have to do for you?
Dorota, have you seen the Duchess?
in library.
Oh, my effing god!
well, I don't have to explain myself to you.
no explanation necessary. I think I got it.
Catherine?
she'll just be one more minute, if you don't mind.
here you go.
can I just say how sorry I am that I judged you earlier?
you judged me?
I thought you were just a callow, social-climbing former swimsuit model who married above her station only to be enslaved by her own insecurities.
but now that I've seen you rolling around on the floor with my adolescent ex,I understand you have a compassionate side, too.
what are you saying, Blair?
that I think you'll find it in your heart to take pity on me,
and in spite of my common, lowly, unroyal ways,
accept that I have true feelings for Marcus and that he has them for me, too.
I think that would be the best thing for both of us, don't you?
Oh, there you are. Hello, darling.
am I too late?
as soon as I heard you were at Blair's party, duchess,
I knew I had to find you and do damage control.
is there still time, or have you already scared Blair off?
not at all, dear. Blair here is a treat.
I can see why you're so fond of her.
she never likes my girlfriends.
she just had to get to know the real me.
did you say girlfriend?
she asked you to make her a dress? I know, right?
I already did some sketches on the train.
dad! Jenny! Hey!
Oh! I missed you! It's so good to see you.
Mmm. And a kitchen full of food. I'm starving. Hey, dad.
Yeah, a little caprese salad, a little gnocchi with pesto. Yummy!
first Humphrey family meal of the fall-- I figured we should do something special. Yeah.
I want to hear all about the Hamptons and everything else that happened this summer. Well, it sounds like Jenny's got some stories.
so does Dan. Did you hear he finished his? Oh, it finally has an ending?
uh, well, this chapter does, yeah. Chapter?
yeah I thought it was a short story.
I'm thinking of reworking it into a novel.
Oh, a novel.That's not ambitious. Yeah.
hmm. Someone must think his life's pretty fascinating.
Oh, thanks for the support, guys.
you're both being written out. Well, what about you, dad?
you were the one on the great american road trip.
any, uh, stories worthy of your memoir?
Oh, you know, it was fun, but there's no place like home.
Aw! Oh, that's an original thought.
you know, if you do write a memoir, you should think about a ghostwriter.
you know, I told you that your back could never handle those bunk beds.
Mm. Face it, dad. You're getting old.
Yep. That's it all right. This looks good.
it looks fantastic.
you were right, as usual.
well, I don't want to say I told you so, but...
all I had to do was just be myself, and Catherine loved me.
Oh, I'm proud of you, b.
great.
actually, Serena, can we have a second?
um, I'll take that.
I'll just leave-- leave you two alone.
did you enjoy meeting Duchess Beaton?
I did.
that's not sarcasm in your voice. It's-- victory. I know.
your plan to ruin me totally backfired.
it turns out Marcus' mommy is even sicker than you are.
you got along great.
I think she recognized a part of herself in me.
or rather, I recognized someone in her.
I don't follow. All you need to know is that you lost.
but don't be too hard on yourself.
it was a solid effort. Tomorrow's another day.
good night, Chuck. Good night, Blair.
Hey, Nate.
so that maybe took a little longer than you thought.
a little bit, yeah.
uh, hey, listen.
I'm--I'm so sorry, but I'm not gonna be able to make it back tonight.
I-I figured. It--it's okay. I was tired anyway.
so we'll hang out another time.
Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure. um...
so--so look, I'll call you later, okay?
okay. Bye.
Bye.
are we good?
we're good.
every summer,
vacationers traverse the globe in search of new sights and experiences.
but when it comes to scandal, I'll take Manhattan every time.
welcome home, upper east siders.
you know you missed me.
X. o.x. o. Gossip girl.
gossip girl here--your once and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan'slite.
waiting for you in Tuscany the first few days were mildly humiliating.
but when I realized you weren't gonna show, I rallied.
luckily, I made a friend on the trip over.
my name is actually Marcus Beaton.
I'm british and a lord.
please don't leave with him.
you're telling me you didn't have any fun with anyone all summer?
I don't think I'm ready. i-i still miss Dan sometimes.
well, I've just been trying to distract myself the best I can.
I was hoping when I saw you, I would know that we did the right thing.
but i-i don't feel that way. I don't feel that way at all.
what about all those rumors I heard about you and Nate? completely untrue.
they just got people off my back about being sad,
and then Nate could do whatever he wanted.
when you told me your secret girlfriend was older,
I thought you meant college.
not to mention, Catherine's married.
I just wish I could make her feel as badly as I feel right now.
you totally can.
I can't believe that you would try to make me jealous
in front of my husband and our friends. well, did it work?
completely.
I haven't been able to get you out of my head all summer.
as summer comes to an end,
I'd like to share a few of the things I've learned about fun in the sun.
gossip girl's guide to summer, " tip number one-- don't fall asleep on the job.
the best hookups are free of morning breath and awkward conversation.
the only thing harder than making up is waking up.
morning.
what?
I'm sorry. i-i'm just a little, um...
overwhelmed?
confused.
last night was...
it was amazing.
and confusing.
okay. now I'm-- I'm a little confused.
well, it was so romantic what you did, showing up here,
and it feels so right to be together.
but you're having second thoughts.
no. i-i just think that we should think...
before we get back together, right?
y-yeah, I mean, I thought-- I thought this meant we were back together.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
no, you're not.
no, I'm not at all.
and neither am i, and--and I want to keep it that way.
but this is a big decision, and--and we did break up for a reason...
many reasons.
but this was never our problem.
I will see you back in the city...
Mmm. fully clothed...
with lots of people around. okay?
we'll talk.
Yeah, about our problems.
that sounds great.
summer tip number two-- there's no "we" in summer, only "u" and "me.
find out where you stand before you find yourself stood up.
anyone can canoodle in july and august, but will he be gone by september?
so what's next?
I was thinking breakfast-- a little french toast, some coffee.
no.
I mean, since you don't go to Princeton or Georgetown,
I assume you're not headed back to college.
so where are you headed? are you staying here?
would it be too forward of me to say I'll go wherever you go?
I'd be honored, milord.
Blair, you don't have to call me that.
in fact, you shouldn't-- I know. don't worry.
I was up all night reading "Debrett's Peerage.
I'm well versed in your lordly ways, and I'm ready to meet the queen,
which I also watched on dvd, b. t.w.
well, I can see that you are quite prepared.
as you've probably guessed, I have to get back to the city.
senior year awaits.
Mm. let me think.
a beautiful girl, autumn in new york.
well, I think I could find some way to entertain myself. really?
Absolutely. my family will be glad I'm staying in one place for a while.
Oh, your family. I'd love to meet the duke and duchess.
Duchess. right. w-well, we'll see.
will you euse me for a moment?
things are going south with lord Marcus.
who's lord Marcus? James.
it turns out that he was only pretending to be a commoner.
it's like "roman holiday,"
only I'm Gregory Peck, and he's Audrey Hepburn.
Oh, suddenly it's all so clear.
he's not really a college student.
he's a lord, and I love him.
okay, I'm gonna take your word for it, but, Blair, love?
like, very much.
and not just because Tom Hanks gave him a kleenex at lady di's funeral.
and you really expect me to believe this isn't all about revenge on Chuck?
revenge is so 12 hours ago,
and just because Marcus happens to be the perfect post-Bass
palate cleanser doesn't mean he isn't a delicious dish in his own right.
okay, so it sounds like you guys are soul mates.
what exactly is the problem? he's being vague about the future.
Marcus. hey.
Hello, Chuck. I was just getting something to eat.
do you mind if I join you? I do, yes. uh, I'm dining with Blair.
and I feel I should tell you, I know you two have a history.
around here, who doesn't? but you're with Blair now.
I get that. there's no reason we can't be civil.
after all, isn't that a trait your people pride themselves on?
right.
well, for England then.
shall we?
we shall.
wait, you just found out this guy's real identity.
I think it's a little soon to be worrying about the rest of your lives.
but not the rest of the year.
it's the season for flings-- tennis pros and townies. I'm his secret summer shame.
Blair waldorf--a fling?
hmm. you're not exactly low maintenance.
speaking of, where were you last night?
did the lifeguard turn up at the party,
or did you find another disposable?
uh, sorry, Blair. I have to go.
wait. Serena!
Hi. hey, I thought you were gonna... I thought you'take the train.
take the--the train. yeah. but you're taking the jitney. me, too.
I-I was--i was just gonna use some of that downtime to do some of the thinking that we talked about. and you should, you know, just 'cause,
um, we're not gonna make out,
it doesn't mean we have to totally avoid each other. yeah, right. well, we're-- it's not like we're-- wee animals.
I think--i think we can share the same bus without, uh,
R-running off together.
I'm gonna sit over here. I'll be here.
and that's me.
fantastic. I'll call you. please.
and, uh... Chuck, what are you doing in my chair?
Oh, we've got a date to play squash at Chuck's father's club.
Charles, sidebar.
actually, we weren't finished.
notice how my voice didn't go up at the end? not a question.
squash? I'll squash you.
it's just a game, Blair.
not to me, bass-hole. I like him.
and so do i, and apparently, he doesn't have too many friends.
Chuck just informed me that he and Serena are leaving immediately.
do you think I could catch a ride back into town with you?
of course.
Hey, mom. it's looking really nice out here.
Thanks. I couldn't sleep, so I got up early.
are you going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm gonna head back into the city, actually.
but there's still a few more days of vacation. yeah, I know.
I figured it'd be good to get back in and settled before school starts.
I mean, Louisa's at the house, right?
it's--it's not a big deal. no.
I haven't wanted to tell you this,
but you're going to find out soon enough.
find out what?
the federal prosecutor has taken your father's leaving town as an admission of guilt.
they want to forfeit our assets...
for restitution.
what, they wanna take our money?
well, not yet, but they have frozen our accounts.
and now they're making an inventory of everything that we own.
I asked your granddad for help. what, you told grandpa?
not that it did any good.
as you can imagine,
he's not very happy with my role in your father's departure.
for the time being at least, I've been cut off.
I can't believe you knew all this, and you didn't say anything.
all summer, I kept hoping I could make it go away, and maybe I still can,
which is why I need you to keep your chin up and trust that your mother's got this handled.
no, when he left, dad told me to take care of you. and you are.
Nate, let's not fight about this, please.
tip number three-- take time to smell the flowers.
mom, I gotta go. let's talk about this later, okay?
it's true that all good things must come to an end,
and august is no exception.
they don't call it "fall" for nothing.
Hey, this is Nate. please leave a message.
Nate, it's Catherine.
listen, last night was not smart.
in fact, it was very, very stupid,
which is why we're gonna have to be much more clever
when we get back to the city. call me when you get this.
Oh. darling.
Duchess, you weren't home when I packed up.
just wanted to say good-bye to you and dad before I left.
well, your father's run up to boston till tomorrow,
but I'm sure he sends his love.
listen, I'll see you in the city for dinner.
I want to hear all about your summer. and me, yours.
see you then.
Ah. manhattan, here we come.
cheers to that, Blair.
nothing says "welcome home" like a bottle of bubbly...
ready?
Aah! and a scandal bubbling.
sorry. um, I'm done reading my magazine...
Oh. and I know that you like...
the music reviews, so if you want to read it, you can.
thank you.
want one?
Oh, no thanks. I'm good.
I'm sorry.
it's okay.
so? what are your plans later?
I mean, besides racquet sports with your new friend Chuck?
Oh, the duchess was hoping we'd get dinner.
dinner? I'd love to have dinner with your mother.
Oh, she's my stepmother, actually,
not that this makes her an any less forceful presence in my life.
but I meant we are having dinner--she and i.
we haven't seen each other much all summer, so...
Oh. of course. I understand.
it's just...
you'll be missing my big party.
you're having a party?
I can't believe I didn't mention it.
every year I have a big "welcome back to the city" party for all my friends.
it's only my favorite event of the year.
then I'll tell the duchess we'll catch up another time.
you don't have to, but thank you.
no offense, but don't you think you're a little outmatched?
at squash?
I've been playing my father since the eighth grade.
how good can Marcus be? no, I mean, as a guy.
Blair wants to be a princess,
and your greatest achievement is owning part of a burlesque club.
which is why I have to get to know him.
see, no one's that perfect.
once I get him out of the way, then I'll have a clear shot at Blair.
Oh, you know it's love when you start talking like an assassin.
I think you're jealous of my new best friend.
well, I have been hoping someone would tag in for a while now.
Hello?
uh, I can't talk right now.
I'll have to call you when I'm home.
Hey, if you need to work out the details of your takedown,
don't let me stop you. you know me well, but it's nothing.
it's still kind of a mess, but I think you get the idea.
well?
you're being very quiet.
is that good quiet or bad quiet?
come on. I'm freaking out.
I'm freaking out.
this place is amazing. people might actually come here.
that was the idea.
I know, but when I talked about converting our storage space into a cafe,
I was thinking of a folding table and a coffeemaker.
Vanessa, thank you. this is a great homecoming present.
it's exactly what I needed.
what you needed for what? aren't you happy to be home?
Yeah, of course.
I can't wait till the kids get back from the hamptons.
I miss 'em like crazy.
and they miss you, too, but...
no buts. I had a great time this summer.
I had forgotten what it was like to be on the road,
performing for a live audience night after night.
and now that you remember...
I'm grateful for the memory.
now does this place actually serve coffee or what?
Yes, it does.
uh, to go, please.
I need to head downtown.
one house blend, on the house.
and see what else you can find upstairs then. excuse me.
you Nate Archibald? yeah.
since this is my house, how about I ask the questions?
don't worry. your family's lawyer is upstairs, supervising.
supervising what, exactly?
us.
we've moved into your house,
and we're going through every single thing your family owns.
Wow. you're actually enjoying this, aren't you?
look, no one wants to hold a yard sale.
we want your father locked up.
no, we already told the prosecutors we don't know where he is.
that's too bad.
we'll deal with it. maybe you will.
but after spending so much time in your mom's closet,
I feel like I know the lady.
I don't think she'll adjust so well.
Hi. it's Catherine. leave a message.
Hey. it's me. uh, listen, I really need to talk to someone.
so, um, I need to talk to you.
so if you can call me, please.
something tells me you're off your game.
anything I can help with?
uh, no one can help.
you sure?
well, it's the duchess. you know how it is.
tell me.
no one's ever good enough.
I've dated a lot of topflight girls, and she always sends them running.
it's like--and she gets inside their heads,
figures out their worst fears and just--- ruthlessly exploits that fear.
it's rough.
not to mention, she's completely got my father's ear.
of course, Blair is desperate to meet her.
and when Blair sets her mind on something...
exactly.
that's a match.
I'd say let's keep at it, but I have to get ready for Blair's party.
party? right.
Thanks, Chuck. we should do this again.
see you at the Hudson.
perfect.
and, uh, there was a problem with your cell earlier.
why don't I get your home number? yeah, sure.
Spotted--Chuck Bass putting his new b. f.f. on speed dial.
is it the beginning of a beautiful bro-mance...
that was a good match. you nearly had me.
or the end of Blair's bid to be british?
well done, Dorota. I like what I'm seeing.
now make the library the sky terrace, the ranunculus dahlias,
the veuve clicquot laurent-pierre, and I think we have ourselves a party.
thank you, miss Blair.
this guest list, however, is a complete page one.
but those are your friends.
then invite strangers.
I have to present myself as a crown jewel, surrounded by other smaller,
slightly flawed gems, but quality stones nonetheless.
and try to round up a couple people who can vote
so it doesn't feel like a total high school party.
a party at the Hudson, huh? I got your message.
since when are you having a party?
since it became clear that Marcus does not think I'm worthy of meeting his family. oh, my god.
obviously I have some more work to do.
B. you don't have to do this. yes, I do.
Marcus dated the descendant of princess grace.
his consort needs to be able to host royal
dinners and hobnob with oligarchs and dictators.
well, if you can't find common ground with a dictator,
I don't know who can. Dan likes soccer, right?
or "football," as Marcus calls it.
you think it'd be too weird if he came? um, no, not necessarily.
good.
you'll call him?
wait, so does this mean you actually think Dan has a redeeming quality?
as long as he knows his arse from his arsenal, I think he's aces.
well, this could be a good opportunity for us to get together and talk.
you know, I have been thinking about the breakup-- ugh!
what is to think about?
you're finally free from downer Dan, and I have my old Serena back.
so come on. there's lots of work to do.
Nate.
Hey. look, could i, uh, could I talk to you for a second?
I'm actually in the middle of something. oh. do you have a girl here?
I mean, what about your devotion to Blair?
it's not a girl. it's business.
I'm, uh, liquidating my shares in Victrola.
wait, you're selling the club? but you love that place.
Chuck, if you're trying to impress Blair...
I mean, come on. look, what you said in the limo was right.
if I'm gonna compete with this guy, I have to rise to his level.
Yeah, but don't you think that's a little extreme?
maybe, but given the situation, it's the right thing to do.
and, uh, I should probably get back to it.
the sooner I get it done, the sooner I can brag about it to Blair.
okay. all right. i, um, I'll see ya.
Yeah. what's going on?
what are you up to right now?
is this gonna take much longer?
I told Mrs. Archibald we could have it done by tonight.
Hey. hey. it's me. hey, you. did you get my message?
Yeah.
Yeah, and listen, before you say anything else,
I just want to let you know that, uh, this morning, on the--on the bus...
Yeah, we didn't exactly stick to the plan, did we?
well, uh, no. the plan was deeply flawed.
I think we overestimated our powers of restraint...
or, uh, i-i-i did, at least.
Yeah, me, too, but then I realized something.
Yeah, me, too. really?
Yeah, well, uh...
I-I think if we want to figure anything out for real, you know,
WE--WE--WE do need to take some time... alone.
sure.
Yeah, um, but Blair's not gonna like that.
Blair?
Yeah, it's actually why I called.
your knowledge of premier league football is integral to one of her schemes.
she just wants you to come to a party. a party?
Yeah, well, I'll be there, and I really wanna see you.
Yeah. yeah, I guess we can start with the new plan tomorrow.
you know,
they're obviously just trying to scare us to get us to rat out my dad.
you do know where he is, right?
Yeah, but...
I couldn't.
even after everything he's done.
just had to put it out there.
but if the worst-case scenario comes true,
I promise my sister and I will give your mom
some good pointers on how to do more with less.
I'd love to see that.
the salvation army's having a bag sale on saturday,
and Ruby knows this place in the village that has two-for-one taco night.
stop it.
it's lesbian-mexican. sometimes their band plays there.
um, just one second, okay?
Hey, mom.
Hey, Nate.
I just wanted to apologize for scaring you this morning.
it turns out I was able to fix things after all.
how? you didn't tell them where dad is, did you?
of course not.
I just got a loan from a family friend.
from who? that doesn't matter.
but I just find it hard to believe that you opened up to one of the book club ladies and told them we're completely broke.
he's not in book club. he's outside of my regular circle.
Oh, so you just asked someone you barely know for money? I didn't ask.
he offered, and when I tried to refuse,
he insisted that it was the right thing to do. the right thing to do?
you said he's outside of your regular circle?
is he in mine?
Nate, please stop it. let me do this.
okay, fine. I won't bring it up again.
everything okay?
no, actually, it's not. look, I gotta go.
I'll come back later tonight, but I have to find Chuck first.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, the place looks great.
I'm so glad I called you.
I really missed you this summer.
Thanks.
me, too.
Charles bass?
I'm sorry.
I wasn't expecting anyone so young or so beautiful.
just because I didn't give birth to Marcus
doesn't mean I'm any less interested in his well-being.
I don't usually take meetings with children, Charles,
so what do you have to say for yourself?
plenty.
lordy, lordy, look who's 40-- or at least a well-preserved 38.
we knew Chuck had a thing for older women,
but is this risky business or strictly business?
wasn't that wonderful?
thank you, Ingrid and Beatrice.
I'm Ingrid. she's Beatrice.
that's what I said.
Ah! I just love mozart.
uh, that wasn't mozart.
come, come.
Blair, who are these people?
Dorota invited them.
uh, no-- Dan, hi! I'm sorry.
come meet the lord. okay.
uh, h-hello, lord. I'm Dan Humphrey.
Marcus beaton. nice to meet you, Dan.
do--do you know Serena?
I do.
he does.
Dan is a football fanatic.
he's a huge Chelsea fan.
Oh, me, too. I just love the Balenciaga store.
freshen your drink?
Mm. yes, please.
so, uh...
sh-she actually refers to him as "the lord"?
I'm so glad you're here.
Chuck.
the name's Dan.
no, Chuck's here, and Blair didn't invite him.
maybe he's her plus-one.
what are you doing here? Blair.
that's Nate's...
mom's friend.
um, I have to go. I'll be back.
I thought you might like to meet my friend.
Why? so she can warn me about the effects of too much tox?
Blair, is it?
I'm duchess Beaton.
the duchess?
the duchess?
nice to meet you.
a little soon for flowers, no?
just a few finishing touches.
a much better job than I could've ever done.
you just weren't here to do it.
sure, but you were.
how would you like to continue?
Why? where have you been all day?
I, uh, had a meeting with Tanya Donelly.
she has a college tour coming up.
another tour?
what do Dan and Jenny think?
well, before I ask them, I wanted to see if it was even possible.
Alison's open to coming back for a while longer,
but I know that summer's over, and you've got your schoolwork.
Yeah, homeschooling really ties me up.
if, however,
you're asking if I don't mind sticking around while you're away,
it's not exactly brain surgery.
but are you really sure you wanna leave so soon?
well, if I'm honest, I'm not sure what I want.
this was supposed to be my chance to get it all out of my system.
but I didn't know how much I missed it.
I'm not done.
Wow. that is honest.
well, whatever you decide, I loved fixing up the place,
and I'd be happy to stick around.
just let me know.
Thanks.
come on. if you really like him, just apologize.
what good will it do me now?
Duchess?
I am so sorry about what I said about the botox.
your work is flawless.
look, I know you're here with Chuck,
and I can only imagine what he's said about me-- limo sex,
social torture of freshmen, blackmail.
but I assure you, there is an explanation for all of it.
save your breath, Blair.
Chuck didn't tell me a thing.
Oh. he didn't?
wait. he--he didn't? I told him not to bother.
none of it makes any difference to me,
because nothing will change the fact that despite your best efforts-- which are completely transparent, by the way-- Marcus is never going to end up with a lowly Waldorf.
Nate.
Nate? Catherine?
you two know each other?
no. no, no, no. yeah, well, just from book club this summer.
but that's it. they've had no other personal contact.
uh, Blair's dating Catherine's stepson.
and, Catherine, Nate's Blair's ex.
what's this?
Chuck's date and Blair's date are mother and son,
and Nate and Blair are exes, and Nate and the mother are in a book club?
now there's a novel plot twist.
this party's a complete bust.
my whole life's a bust.
well, it serves you right.
you were scheming to convince Marcus you're someone you're not.
but my intentions were good.
I really do like him. I just...
as soon as I knew he liked me,
I would have relaxed and dropped the manipulative plotting
and devoted myself to being the best girlfriend ever.
see? thank you.
there's my b.
show this girl to Catherine, and she'll want you to be with Marcus.
this is you. just be yourself.
she made "Waldorf" rhyme with "Spears."
I may as well have gone commando and
held my party at Nyla's burger basket.
fine.
while you stand here and feel sorry for yourself and
denigrate the fine people of Kentwood, I'm gonna go find Dan.
cheer up.
I can't believe you'd do this to me.
bring the Duchess to Blair's party? what do you care?
no, I know about the money.
Nate...
no. you weren't trying to sell Victrola to impress Blair.
you did it to loan my family money?
look, you say it like it's a bad thing.
no, and maybe you were just doing it to be a friend,
but I would never let you do that, and you knew that,
which is why you didn't tell me. yes, it is. so what?
so what? you go behind my back and make a deal with my mom?
she called me to see if I thought you were okay.
I didn't know what she was talking about,
because you didn't tell me anything was wrong.
I'll tell you what's wrong-- my best friend lying to my face.
look, normally, I would agree with you.
but for your mom to open up to me about something like this,
I'll handle it, okay? how?
Dan, hey. you leaving?
Yeah, I have to get Jenny from the train.
I-I didn't know if you were coming back, so... how about coming with you?
why don't we get out of here?
who are we kidding?
what do you say we just forget thinking and follow our hearts?
are you sure that's your heart you're following? 'cause...
shut up, or I'll change my mind.
Hey, clearly, there are other forces at work here in the universe, so...
Mmm. forces much more powerful than us.
I'm glad we had this little talk.
Oh, are you two back together or...
uh, uh, no. this was just a little, uh, friendly-- kiss, yeah. mm-hmm.
okay. are you coming?
in library, come meet me
uh, no, no. you guys, uh, you guys should go ahead.
Oh. good.
cause, uh, this elevator's gonna be in use.
Hey. this is so messed up.
your ex dating my stepson? yes, it is.
but I actually do know you, Nate.
that isn't what's bothering you.
well, I think I'm starting to get it, you know,
how things are gonna be now that the summer's over.
I mean,
it would be kind of nice to have someone who could actually be there.
but when the best version of the situation
is that I'm gonna become Blair's father-in-law?
I think it's just time to move on, Catherine. no, wait, Nate.
come on, I'm here now, and I want to talk.
just tell me what's going on.
Hey, dad. it's me.
um, I talked to Dan, so he's gonna pick me up at the train station.
so I'll just see you at home, but--oh, my god! stop it!
sorry, dad. I gotta go kick eric's ass in a water fight.
love you. bye.
Yeah. hey, Tanya. it's me--Rufus.
I think Anne Archibald would rather die than lose her house, her things.
they're her whole identity.
that's why I'm not gonna let that happen.
I'll find a way. god, but it's not what she's gonna have to live without.
it's what she's gonna have to live with.
I mean, a scandal will destroy her.
can you imagine her watching her house seized,
her grandmother's jewels up for auction?
I told you, I'll figure something out.
I can handle this. I just need some time.
you can take care of this...
with my help.
it'd just be between you and me. no one would have to know.
I care about you, Nate. I would do it for you.
and what would I have to do for you?
Dorota, have you seen the Duchess?
in library.
Oh, my effing god!
well, I don't have to explain myself to you.
no explanation necessary. I think I got it.
Catherine?
she'll just be one more minute, if you don't mind.
here you go.
can I just say how sorry I am that I judged you earlier?
you judged me?
I thought you were just a callow,
social-climbing former swimsuit model who married above
her station only to be enslaved by her own insecurities.
but now that I've seen you rolling around on the floor with my adolescent ex,.
I understand you have a compassionate side, too.
what are you saying, Blair?
that I think you'll find it in your heart to take pity on me,
and in spite of my common, lowly, unroyal ways,
accept that I have true feelings for Marcus and that he has them for me, too.
I think that would be the best thing for both of us, don't you?
Oh, there you are. hello, darling.
am I too late?
as soon as I heard you were at Blair's party, duchess,
I knew I had to find you and do damage control.
is there still time, or have you already scared Blair off?
not at all, dear. Blair here is a treat.
I can see why you're so fond of her.
she never likes my girlfriends.
she just had to get to know the real me.
did you say girlfriend?
she asked you to make her a dress? I know, right?
I already did some sketches on the train.
dad! Jenny! hey!
Oh! I missed you! it's so good to see you.
Mmm. and a kitchen full of food. I'm starving. hey, dad.
Yeah, a little caprese salad, a little gnocchi with pesto. yummy!
first Humphrey family meal of the fall--
I figured we should do something special. yeah.
I want to hear all about the Hamptons and everything else that happened this summer. well, it sounds like Jenny's got some stories.
so does Dan. did you hear he finished his? oh, it finally has an ending?
uh, well, this chapter does, yeah. chapter?
yeah I thought it was a short story.
I'm thinking of reworking it into a novel.
Oh, a novel. that's not ambitious. yeah.
hmm. someone must think his life's pretty fascinating.
Oh, thanks for the support, guys.
you're both being written out. well, what about you, dad?
you were the one on the great american road trip.
any, uh, stories worthy of your memoir?
Oh, you know, it was fun, but there's no place like home.
Aw! oh, that's an original thought.
you know, if you do write a memoir, you should think about a ghostwriter.
you know, I told you that your back could never handle those bunk beds.
Mm. face it, dad. you're getting old.
Yep. that's it all right. this looks good.
it looks fantastic.
you were right, as usual.
well, I don't want to say I told you so, but...
all I had to do was just be myself, and Catherine loved me.
Oh, I'm proud of you, b.
great.
actually, Serena, can we have a second?
um, I'll take that.
I'll just leave-- leave you two alone.
did you enjoy meeting Duchess Beaton?
I did.
that's not sarcasm in your voice. it's-- victory. I know.
your plan to ruin me totally backfired.
it turns out Marcus' mommy is even sicker than you are.
you got along great.
I think she recognized a part of herself in me.
or rather, I recognized someone in her.
I don't follow. all you need to know is that you lost.
but don't be too hard on yourself.
it was a solid effort. tomorrow's another day.
good night, Chuck. good night, Blair.
Hey, Nate.
so that maybe took a little longer than you thought.
a little bit, yeah.
uh, hey, listen.
I'm--I'm so sorry, but I'm not gonna be able to make it back tonight.
I-I figured. it--it's okay. I was tired anyway.
so we'll hang out another time.
Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure. um...
so--so look, I'll call you later, okay?
okay. bye.
Bye.
are we good?
we're good.
every summer,
vacationers traverse the globe in search of new sights and experiences.
but when it comes to scandal, I'll take manhattan every time.

X. o.x. o. gossip girl.
gossip girl here
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
it sounds like you still like him.
I'm really sorry about nate.
if it's any consolation, I don't think he ever really liked me anyway.
I mean, I haven't heard from him in weeks.
our friendship is more important than some guy, right?
he has a P. I. On retaineR.
Bart's people are top-notch and very discreet.
did you hire someone to look into my past?
do you have a lily bass dossier?
aaron asked me out, but I said no because I wasn't sure how you would feel.
I like aaron, so you have my blessing what are you doing here?
well, it's thanksgiving, and I couldn't think of anywhere that felt more like home.
what about bart? - Not coming.
Vanessa, I-I haven't heard from jenny in weekS.
so can we get together sometime?
I guess that'd be ok as of right now, this moment i am officially a one-woman winter in new york...
a gossip girl checklist to surviving the cold
cashmere store for ice-skating at wollman rin jacques torres hot chocolate for window-shopping the holiday dispys...
and the perfect date to the senior snowflake charity ball.
B. I have other things to do today.
Serena, this is the holiday event for high school senior the cr de la cr from all the big private schools will be there.
the pictures dominate the society pages through the new year. I need a ringer.
wait, have all of these guys asked you already?
of course. You think angelina jolie even considers a project without an offer on the table?
I'm strictly a pay or play dater.
just out of curiosity, who's in the lead to play "guy with no future"?
what makes you think I'm not looking for something long-term call it a hunch.

I found it at the rare book store you told me about last weeK.
I'm giving it to aaron for hanukah.
that's very nice. it means he must accepted your invitation to the snowflake ball.
unfortunately, he will be unable to attend.
apparently, high society formals don't go with the whole brooklyn artist thing.
well, I--it's an acquired taste, to be sure.
will you still be going? - Absolutely.
there's something I love about the snowflake ball.
it reminds me of "anna karenina," only by anna wintour.
I'll just be flying solo.
that's my preferred method of social tra that's good.
uh, we can-- we can hang out then.
Dan humphrey, the scourge of high society, is going to the ball?
I know. I'm still reeling.
uh, yeah, I just realized that some of the best memories in my past two years have, have been at those eve so I figured, why fight it?
well, look who's embracing change
I'm assuming that aaron will be okay with two dateless friends hanging out at the ball together?
Yeah. He--he better be.
and he's friends with his ex, lexi.
she's actually coming to town for the holidays.
I'm going to the gallery now to see his new installation, do you want to come?
I just have to stop and change first yeah. Yeah, sure.
I got your message.
what's the emergency?
do you consider muddy watter cs orlassic rock?
I'm reorganizing my dad's record collection by genre.
Why?
because I already bound all of dan's short stories and cleaned the loft twice.
did you accidentally put red bull in your cereal this morning?
no, I just need to keep myself busy, otherwise, I'm gonna start thinking about my future, and then there's gonna be a jenny humphrey-shaped hole through my wall.
okay, would you stop putting so much pressure on yourself?
you're back home and you're still a great designer.
the future will work itself out.
it's just that's not all I'm thinking about.
what?
okay, look, I don'T...
I don't want to be awkward but the one thing I can't figure out is what happened with nate.
is that totally pathetic, sitting around, thinking about how some guy blew you off?
no.
but in my experience, it doesn't really help either.
I'move on.
Yeah.
sorry. I told rufus that I'd be at the gallery all days so I'll see you later?
Yeah. I'll be here, literally...
probably in the same spot.
Oh, hello, weird documentary girl good-bye, sad blair wannabe.
Penelope, what are you doing here?
snowflake ball--I wanna commission a dress.
your fashion show was impressive.
Thanks, but snowflake ball's tomorrow and I kinda hate you, so
I know, but this is about fashion, not friendship, J hazel and is keep biting my style, and I need something cus them.
I'm very expensive. - I hope so.
I think we'd better have a second snowflake machine
I mean, it is called the snowflake ball we can't have drizhey.
Hey. - hey
I thought the decorating committee agreed on poinsettias.
Oh, they did. I didn'T.
uh, casablanca lily sneaky.
Hey, thanks for offering, to help out.
it's really been fun.
well, when you just happened to mention my background in sound systems and lack of volunteer hours at the last P. T.A. Meeting...
I sort of got your signal.
sorry. I had to get out of the house then, and I didn't want to be down here alone.
you and bart still haven't talk no, it's my fault.
since thanksgiving, I've pretty much hung up the, marital "do not disturb" sign.
well, you're gonna have to talk to him sooner or later well, isn't that what new year's resolutions are for
have you decided if you're going to, make it to the dance or not?
witness the fruit of your labors?
jury's still out.
all right, well, if you do, save me a dance.
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.
we need to talk.
fine.
they're adorable you know, I feel inspired to shop at the gap.
or, validate my self-image with overpriced cosmetics wait a minute.
you sure this one didn't just come with the frame?
women have been the focal point for artists throughout history, and you know it. - Exactly.
Yeah, way to swing at a 2, 000-year-old pitch.
and with blondie the bombshell, no less
Serena, dan, hey. This is lexi the ex? I was wondering when I'd finally meet you.
so I-I know I probably should've asked onsoer, but how would you feel about coming with me to the snowflake ball
Oh. Uh...I would love to, but I don't--I don't think it's a very good idea right now oh, you mean, you haven't told jenny about this.
look, I know you guys are close, and I'm the last person who'want to come between friends.
but believe me. Jenny doesn't care.
I mean, she pretty much blew me off.
but what--what if she didn't?
I mean, what if you found out that she still liked you.
I mean...
Vanessa, I'm--I'm really happy right noW.
let's just go with this.
please - okay. - Okay.
but...
we're in "gossip girl" country, so rein in your horses.
you're probably right.
okay.
so tell me. Whatever happened between you and nate?
I'm sorry?
please. Your kiss was all over "gossip girL.
and he was living here, wasn't he?
it--yeah, for a little bit.
why do you care?
now that the archibald name is on the social rebounce
I was thinking of asking nate to the ball so what's the story?
nothing.
um, nothing even happened between us, so...
I wouldn't beat yourself up about it.
I mean, you had to know it was doomed from the start.
he's upper east side, and you're, well... here you've gotta be kidding me.
sorry ladies found nate archibald
looks like he
I really don't appreciate your showing up unannounced at a school function.
I'm sorry, but you haven't left me many options, and we do need to talk.
fine. Talk.
it's, it's been a long time since I've been a husband,
I just want you to know that I fired andrew tyler that private investigator who gathered all those files.
no more snooping. No more trying to control you and the kids it's done, and I'm sorry for everything.
thank you, but, I don't think that's enough.
well, then tell me what is, and I'll do it.
I can change, lily. You know i can if you'll let me.
I should be back from my miami trip in time to go to the balL.
so if you want to think about what I said.
and are willing to give me a second chance,
I'd be honored to accompany you.
I, um, I have to go. There's a few more things I have to do inside
I know lexi can be a bit much.
Blair waldorf is my best friend.
I can handle "much," but that felt personal.
she doesn't mean anything by it. She thinks she's protecting me.
Oh great! Well, how long is the enforcer gonna be with this?
she's staying with her folks through the holiday.
so is that christmas eve? Or are we talking new year's eve or--or maybe boxing day?
you have any kopi luwak back there?
uh, kopi what wak?
it's a coffee made from berries that have been passed by the asian palm ci it's a cat.
I had it in indonesia.
it's delicious.
well, our cat lives with our grandmother in florida - my sister has allergies. - That's a shame.
Yeah, we do, however, have this bag here of nondescript beans whose berries have been passed through a massive corporate infrastructure, so...
you're funny.
come on. It would mean a lot to me if you gave her a chance, please?
okay. Fine.
but as long as we're swapping favors here, it'd really make me feel much better about you spending all his time with her if yoU...
I don't know, escorted me to my senior winter dance fine.
you got yourself a deal.
so... new plan for tonight
Dan here has agreed to give me a walking tour of brooklyn...
Yeah, last-minute, I-- - and I thought it might be fun for the four of us to hang out get to know each other.
I mean, unless the two of you guys want to hang out alone no, no. Sounds great, lexi.
anyone home?
I have a gift certificate to grimaldI's, and I'm thinking double pepperoe everything okay?
how could you?
really, vanessa?
lying and seeing nate behind my back
I'm so sorry.
I have been meaning to tell you. I just wasn't sure how.
you knew this entire time why nate wasn't calling, and it was because he was with you!
I understand that you're upset.
but if I remember correctly you kissed nate behind my back first.
and I felt so horrible about it that I ran after you, and you were gonE.
so what happened to not letting a guy get in between us?
are you really that desperate, vanessa?!
are you that jealous, jenny? - Oh, my god!
I'm sorry you found out this way. I am.
but since you have, you might as well know that nate asked to the ball tomorrow night, and I think I'm gonna go.
what do you want, bass?
it occurred to me to when I was having my afternoon shiatsu that i should choose your date.
you? Why?
why not? And it'll let me prove I know you better than anyone else.
fine. Then I choose yourS.
I bring a date for you, you bring one for me.
let's see who's paying attention to the other's desires.
there has to be something to keep you honest and make things interesting.
name the stakes.
if you actually like your date - I get your limo for a month. - fine.
and if you like yours, I get dorota.
what? Dorota? - Yes, miss blair fine by the way,
I take my breakfast in bed what are you staring at?
go polish something you know, I-I write on these benches all the time and actually, norman mailer used to live in that town house right therE.
you can't imagine how many times I thought about knocking on his door.
why didn't you?
uh, common courtesy?
okay. It's a door, but... whatever.
no. She's-- she's--she's right.
I-I don't know why I'm always so worried about what people might think of mE.
it certainly hasn't paid off.
and here, I thought the "y" chromoso s incapable of change.
look at you two branching out aaron decided he woulco escort me to the snowflake ball tomorrow night.
wait, I'm sorry. Pause.
snowflake ball? - Yeah.
Yeah, it's this, this, school charity dance that serena and I have.
and you're going as well?
Yeah. - and what?
I'm here to test-drive the norman mailer anecdote for your actual date tomorrow night at the ball no. I don't have a date, actually oh! Oh! Oh!
uh, you know what? I just had the craziest idea why don't the four of us go together?
that is, if you would be my date.
well, it depends that little speech you just gavE...
well, he doesn't live there anymore.
not really the point, is it?
He--he--the man's dead.
come now. Ring doorbell.
you okay with her coming tomorrow?
well, yeah. It's a little "when harry met crazY.
it's as long as dan's fine with it...
I'm guessing he'll end up being more than fine with it.
Meaning?
Lexi likes to sleep with guys on the first date she claims it's a political statement against male-dominated sexual hypocricy or something.
well, can't she just vote?
in her defense, she--she-- she dates very few guyS.
but once there's one in her sights, that's pretty much yet.
you still okay? - Yeah.
whatever.
Yeah, whateveR.
taking off?
morning meeting in miami.
I should be back tomorrow. - sure that's wise?
seems to me the old marriage thermostat is headed south of late.
and whose fault is that.
Thanksgiving was a disaster because of those files.
you think I don't know who had the combination to that safe.
every time I think we're making progress...
you show your true colors hey. Uh, your housekeeper let me iN.
good, then she can let you ouT.
what?
and tell your friend vanessa it's not wise to fish in our pond.
well, she's not my frienD.
Really?
because we were just trying to think of a way to send her a little message feast your eyes, ladies well what do you think?
I think you shouldn't stand in front of the light in that dress oh, my god!
it's see-through!
well, that's one way to be the center of attention.
at least you don't have to worry about going home alone.
Oh, what do you guys think vanessa's wearing to the ball?
she's going to the ball?
Yeah, with nate.
Jenny, isabel's dress looks a little like one of yours don't you think?
no. not at I know of a little something called "lining.
well, what if you didn't snowflake or s fake either way is gonna be a ball
Chuck is in for the shock of his lifE.
I have depths he'll never plumb, but I know every inch of his wafer-thin soul.
what do you think?
you're right.
louboutin peep toes, always.
Hey, just so you know, seeing someone with your ex, even if you think you're ready... not easy.
I assume you're talking about your lame outer-boroughs double date last night.
what happened?
uh, nothing. It was great...
right up until dan asked lexi to go with him to the snowflake ball.
so they're going to the dance?
Yeah, and then I found out she tends to extend herself to guys on a first date - so? - So?! We're--we're friendS.
so shouldn't I, like, give him a heads-up or something?
Oh, absolutely. Guys hate to be caught off guard with sex on the first date you're right. You're right.
I should just not think about it.
exactly, just like I'm sure dan doesn't think about you and aaron all horizontal and sweatY.
wait, you guys have slept together, haven't you?
why not?! He's hot, and you actually like hiM.
how often do you find that in the same guy?
which is why I haven't rushed into anything.
you wanna wait? Fine. But in the meantime, dan is going to be taking a ride on the lexi-coasteR.
think about it.
what are you doing here?
I'm still mad at you.
so what, you're gonna kill me and put me in the garment
I couldn't sleep last nighT.
I was up half the night making this before I realized who it was for.
you made that for me. - yeah.
I mean, I said some pretty awful things 'cause I was hurt so I guess just nsider this a peace offering.
you'll look great.
I, uh... I don't--I don't know what to say just say you'll try it on ok.
I thought I made it clear that we need to find chuck the perfect date.
Kristin curran is the loosest girl in our class.
don't you know that chuck doesn't like his fruit pre-picked?
she has long hair. In poland, long hair symbolizes
and elizabeth phillips is somewhere between mormon and moron!
how did you come up with these?
facebook. I joined few groupS.
this has to be chuck's dream girl
intelligent but not a bookworm, strong-willed but still feminine. An equal and he likes brunettes with deep brown eyes.
but, miss blair, that's you
no, that girl is out there and you better hope for your sake that I find her!
please. I don't want to shine mr. Chuck's shoes for month yeah, his shoes if you're lucky.
what? - Nothing.
now get back to work. Ticktock, ticktock hello?
you know, when you rent a tux in brooklyn they throw in the shoeS.
no, I-I didn't know that.
um, what's going well, this is probably stupid, but I just wanted to make sure that this was all okay with you know, you, me, lexi and aaron.
Yeah, of--of course. Why wouldn't it be well, I don't know. Dramatic precedent?
well, I think we've out grown up good. Good. Me, toO.
uh, you know, I have to say, I'm really looking forward to this tonight oh, okay. GreaT.
um, I will--I'll just talk to you later then yeah, I-I'll see you.

I need to find him.
mom, what's wr bart's been in an accident.
gossip girl
here--your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I've decided to take over Bass industries.
there is one stipulation
that should you in any way act inappropriately, the board has the option
to replace you with your legal guardian,
Which--wouldn't you know it? is me.
I had enough trouble with the idea of mom and Rufus dating,
but now I share a sibling with my boyfriend?
maybe we weren't meant to be a family.
Serena, dean Berube.
I'd like to issue a press release that you came up to visit our glorious campus.
princeton is a trade school.
there is only Yale.
he said that Yale could really use a girl like Blair Waldorf.
Oh, b. I'm so happy for you.
true love and betrayal, revenge and more revenge,
a heroine with an impossible goal
if only Mozart had lived on the upper east side.
Blair bear, you'll be late!
but you can keep your magic flute, Amadeus.
all this queen wants is a golden ticket to Yale.
you look like a firing squad.
more like a welcoming committee.
it's the big day.
it's all the color of Yale. you see?
that's just what I need to perk me up.
I couldn't sleep a wink.
we know. We heard you watching "Gilmore Girls" All night, again.
Oh. I am so a better fit for Yale than that Rory.
Dorota.
don't be sad.
I'm not going anywhere for six months.
that wasn't Dorota, dear.
that was handsome Dan.
look at him.
Yeah, he's a gift from all of us.
Oh! He's the Yale mascot, bulldog
Oh! Just like you after today.
I don't know about the name, though.
we should just call him "handsome.
you're adorable.
Yes, just don't look behind sofa.
no, you're a shoo-in, darling.
Mademoiselle. - Merci.
a shoo-in.
the personal letter that I wrote to dean berube should simply cinch it.
we will celebrate your acceptance tonight at the opera with champagne at all intermissions.
we will be so drunk.
by the time someone dies, we'll just laugh.
is Chuck joining us?
you know how he loves a good tragedy.
Yes. Where is Mr. Chuck?
I wouldn't know, and I don't care.
he's as dead to me as his father is to him.
more blueberries.
Whew! Yale day.
good morning.
I thought we could walk to school
together for support.
I keep telling myself
that everything happens for a reason.
you know, I'll--I'll end up in the right place,
but what if I don't get in?
forget you.
what if I do and Blair doesn't?
fire and--and brimstone
and a lot of bitchy asides,
death by Dorota. Thanks.
you don't have to worry either.
blair's a lock.
the dean told her as much, right?
Yeah. Yeah, Yale is good.
we're good.
everything will be fine.
you're referring to the recent not fun event,
uh, also known as the "you two share a brother,
Oh, wait. no, you don't roller coaster.
not to be outdone by the tilt-a-whirl
called discovering this fact has only served to bringing Rufus and Lily closer than ever.
look, getting into Yale will change our lives.
it'll give us a chance to reinvent ourselves.
Yeah. yeah, and in the meantime,
at least our parents
are keeping it on the down low.
Yeah. - Rufus, stop it.
Oh, hello.
I was planning on sneaking out before anyone got up,
but Lily and I got to bed so late.
Oh, you don't--you-- that's--just stop there.
right.
well, now that this is all out in the open,
maybe we can stop sneaking around.
I mean, we've had the awkward run-in
and it isn't so bad.
I don't know why we thought
this would be so weird.
let's leave now. - Nice try, mom.
Yeah, seriously good effort.
so I was thinking, tonight more than four hours of sleep?
that, and there is a charity gala at the opera.
a full 12 hours then.
Oh, everyone will be there.
it's the--it's the event of the season,
and I'm really feeling ready
to get back to the world.
aren't you worried about people
seeing us together so soon?
the kids know. Why shouldn't the world?
and, uh, we might as well
make our society debut in style.
I was just trying to get out of the opera part.
I'm not a fan.
well, you can become one tonight. mm.
I would say, "get a room,
but yours is right above mine.
please try to remember that.
Oh, my god.
no, I told you, under 18
and I want verification.
I don't care where you have to import them from.
I want them young and unstable.
you can cancel that order.
I already ate.
I'll get right back to you.
your bush league attempts to take me down
they're getting boring.
although, I must admit,
having the freshman class of Brearley
hold their annual sleepover in my hotel room
that was a nice touch.
by the way, don't be alarmed,
but, uh, our stock might take a little dip today.
I'm still adjusting to a learning curve.
no, what you're doing is trying too hard.
you're obviously not cut out for the job,
which is why Bart
never let you out of the outback.
you should be more careful.
or what? it's my company now, kid.
you saw to that.
will the, uh, board and I be seeing you at the opera tonight?
even though you're no longer in charge,
you are still the public face of the company.
I think it's important you display it,
show there's no hard feelings.
maybe I'll show them
they made the wrong choice instead.
Oh, wait. You're already doing that for me, - Aren't you? - No matter.
we probably won't be seeing much of each other anyway.
I'll be in your father's seats,
and you'll be, well, somewhere else.
there's a new kid.
that "kid" is my Shakespeare teacher, Miss Carr.
that-that's Miss Carr?
does she have Benjamin Button syndrome?
here. let us help you.
it's all right.
Oh, thank you, Serena. It's like holding a door never occurred to anybody.
no, not on the upper east side.
these kids have probably
never touched a door in their life.
they just magically open for them, don't they?
Oh, uh, this is my boyfriend, Dan Humphrey.
Dan, this is Miss Carr. She's my favorite new teacher.
well, I've heard a lot about you,
although I-I wasn't expecting you to look so...
out of place?
no, I was gonna say "young." You could pass for a student.
well, I was, until recently.
I've been doing teach for America
the past two years in Alabama.
this is my first salaried job.
I've never even been to New York before.
it's a lot different than Des Moines.
my family is in the hotel business
and the palace lobby is a wonderful place
to get away from the noise.
Yeah, and, you know, if you're ever in Brooklyn,
uh, my dad has a gallery. there's a pretty cool cafe.
Brooklyn--that's, uh, the place across the bridge, right?
ha ha. yeah. you'll fit in just fine here.
Oh, hey, don't let the city get to you.
see you third period. mm-hmm.
nice meeting you, Daniel.
nice meeting you, Miss Carr.
so good luck today.
you, too. May the best get in.
refresh. Refresh. Refresh.
that's not my eliapps account.
no, it's mine.
I applied to Yale, too, remember?
Yes, but your application was
merely a formality to appease your overbearing parents.
you know very well
there's no way Yale is going to accept someone
who got a 2360 on her s. a.t. s,
so give up and go for the gold, my gold.
refresh.
Hey, are you going to the opera thing tonight?
um, yeah. Serena's taking me.
yeah? I might go, too.
you know, for a while, I couldn't take Vanessa
anywhere really nice, 'cause of the whole no money thing,
but I saw a DVD of the "ring" cycle at her house,
and I figured she might like some champagne in my family's box.
that's good. That's good.
don't tell her you saw that DVD,
though, 'cause I-I pointed it out once,
if you've ever seen "a clockwork orange,
you know how that ended up.
wait. What's "a clockwork orange"?
Charles, I didn't expect to see you today.
or ever, if I had it my way.
Yes, well, I missed you, too.
I'm trying to do something.
I really wanted to do it on my own,
but that's not working.
I'm thinking you're the only person left who can help.
what do you say?
what are you guys doing?
Shh. Don't talk to them. they're working.
refresh.
my...
God
what? what is it?
congratulations, Serena van der Woodsen!
you have been accepted.
I'm sorry. I...
I simply can't read it.
the font's too small.
I have to check it on a real computer.
it says "wait-listed" in bold.
I got in. I did it. I got in. oh, my gosh!
I can't believe it. oh, did you?
no. no, no. um, I'm wait-listed, just like Blair.
well, don't worry. you'll get in.
we'll be together next fall. even if you have to wait another couple of months to find out for sure,
it's all good, or it will be.
Yeah, I know it will.
I need to see the headmistress.
right now!
they say that it's not over till the fat lady sings.
but who's that I hear tuning up in the wings?
sorry, b. I think it's curtains.
all my usual moves haven't worked. Jack is blood.
he thinks too much like me, sees me coming.
and the way he's running the business,
I worry everything my father had worked for will be lost.
since you're part of the company now,
I thought you might care.
I do care, Charles,
but my concern is for you, not the company.
you're living alone. why don't you move back in here?
it'll make it a lot easier to work together.
I'm not interested in a family reunion
nor in assuaging your guilt over my father's death.
do you believe in my cause or not?
I do.
but your shenanigans-- planting coke in his gym bag,
ambushing him with a transsexual hooker...
two. they owed me a favor.
will only cast a negative light on you in the board's eyes.
I don't care about the board anymore.
you should. you need them.
so let me help you by handling this like a grownup.
my 20% stake in Bass industries
must count for something, and when I'm done,
perhaps you'll reconsider your living situation.
don't hold your breath.
meet me here at 2: 00?
how did this happen?
Dean Berube said I was a perfect fit.
his exact words were, "Yale could use a girl like Blair Waldorf.
well, apparently, they found one somewhere else.
calm yourself.
when I spoke to Dean Berube this morning,
he assured me that if the student they've accepted
turns them down, you are next in line.
Dan Humphrey?
he's like a cafeteria lady who won the lottery.
you couldn't pry that acceptance from his hands
with the jaws of life.
I wasn't speaking about Mr. Humphrey.
someone from Constance got in?
Blair, in our school's history, most wait-listed students
ultimately get into the college of their choice.
your transcript is a series of unblemished A's.
all you have to do is keep up your g. p.a.
and you'll get in.
I know that patience and trust
aren't necessarily your strong suits,
but you'll just have to rise to the occasion, hmm?
thank you. I'm sure I can do that.
just tell me who got in.
you got in? congratulations.
Oh, shh. don't say it too loud. I haven't told anyone yet,
not even Dan, especially not Blair.
well, why not? - oh, I-I couldn't.
she was wait-listed. it would have been a disaster.
a word of unsolicited advice
it sounds like you're worrying about other people
when this is a decision about you.
do you want Yale?
do you know you're the first person
that's ever asked me that?
the truth is, I don't--I don't know.
the whole reason I went there in the first place was because of Blair, and then I applied because of Dan.
honestly, I think Yale
might be accepting me for the wrong reasons.
I would never advise anyone to turn down a great opportunity,
but going to the right school for you
is the most important thing.
Serena, did you hear someone from Constance got in?
I bet it's that little Nelly.
when I find her, she's not gonna know--hello.
Blair, I missed you first period.
I had a meeting.
you also missed getting this back.
I'll talk to you later, Serena.
Bye. well, if you're on a witch hunt,
that means you can't be too upset, right?
witch hunts are my Valium, Serena.
I'm just trying to stay calm.
what about you?
I have to say, I'm totally surprised Yale passed up
the p. r. of accepting "it" girl Serena van der Woodsen.
they have more class than I thought.
well, like you pointed out, they didn't want me for me.
Dan must be pissed.
his hope of arriving on campus with cachet
has been shot to hell. Now he'll just be lumped in with the rest of the financial aid-iots and poets.
Oh, my god.
what?
I have to go.
Hello? - Miss van der Woodsen,
this is Shirley from dean Berube's office.
the dean would love to issue a press release
that you'll be joining Yale's freshman class in the fall, assuming you're accepting.
would you mind? miss van der Woodsen?
um, I-I-I'm gonna have to call you back.
Charles has left us no choice.
we wish you had been left in charge of the company,
of course, but that's not how it laid out.
well, surely there must be something. Jack is Charles' guardian,
and the contract clearly states that his guardian has control.
short of being able to prove he's completely negligent,
all we can do is our best to temper his actions.
minority shareholders' meeting.
we were just finishing up.
see you soon, I hope, lilian?
Yes, peter, I'd like that.
had I known my own personal Mata Hari was going to be here,
I would have come sooner.
Yes, well, I was just being brought up to date on your progress or lack thereof.
I'll right myself eventually.
I just have to get my legs under me.
maybe the two of us could come together in some way,
help me find my strength... or use it all up.
what's that for? - Your nose. you don't seem so worried about the same morality clause that cost Charles this company.
they won't touch me.
although I may not be doing a bang-up job yet,
it beats having a woman of your reputation at the helm.
this is a "b.
Yes, it is.
you're new here, so you don't know how it works.
I have a feeling you're about to explain.
second semester seniors get a free pass,
like pregnant ladies or 14-year-old chinese gymnasts.
Constance wants their students to get into the best colleges.
that's why this free pass exists.
the headmistress-- if she knew about this grade
she'd rap you on the wrist.
maybe in time, I'll get in trouble
for not inflating grades like everyone else, miss Waldorf,
but until then, I'll give them based on merit.
I need to keep my g. p.a. perfect to get into Yale.
you should have thought of that before.
what's wrong? - I think I might have just lost Yale.
what am I gonna do?
I didn't apply anywhere else.
just hold on a second.
there's a phone call I have to return.
the bastard is untouchable.
well, what should we do? - Time to get dirty. I'm all ears.
let me educate you.
did you really try to buy anthrax with his credit card?
the black market isn't what it used to be.
and you got him on Megan's list?
if only his apartment were a few blocks closer to a playground.
look, I understand why you're trying to do these things,
but we have got to do something that is not illegal.
I've put calls in to Jack's business associates in Australia.
he's not the most upstanding citizen.
I'm sure we will find something.
you know, I, um, I thought I lost you the day of the funeral,
and, um, I'm sorry
that Jack's the one to bring us back together,
but I'm glad that we're doing this.
if your people don't come up with anything,
maybe we could try number 26.
crash Jack in plane.
the Bass jet is kind of expensive, Charles.
there's insurance.
Hello?
Yes. yeah, that would be fine.
I can't really talk right now.
Yes, the, uh, the opera has an early curtain.
Rufus, stop it.
okay, okay. I'll see you then.
Bye.
I can't believe you. You're actually going
to take your half-price hustler out on the town tonight.
I thought we were putting this behind us, Charles.
I'm here to help you.
and what part of you dating someone else
a month after my father's death is helping me?
you say you want to be family, but if you really meant it,
you wouldn't parade your mistress in public.
you'd have some tact,
some respect.
this isn't about your father, Charles.
I should have known from your history I couldn't count on you.
you think of yourself.
your kids and my dead father are proof of that.
Hey, Serena.
Hey, I was thinking maybe we could go to Yale this weekend,
get some hope into you. she's going down.
Yes, she's gonna go.
would you excuse me for a second?
not really.
I know that look you're up to no good.
good is subjective,
and if you don't believe me, you can look it up.
you want to get Rachel back for the grade she gave you.
a new teacher's like a child. It has to be taught.
and spanked.
and I can't risk not getting into Yale,
so it's open season on Miss Iowa.
time to shuck the corn.
I wasn't supposed to say anything,
but you are going to Yale. you got in, an early admission.
what?
how do you know that?
because I declined my acceptance, you're next in line.
they're gonna call you in a couple hours. - You got in?
you're the constance student?
cancel the Nelly yuki project now!
s, why would you turn down Yale?
and don't say for me, because even I wouldn't believe you.
Yeah, why--why would you do that?
I'm--I'm sorry. i-i wanted to tell you.
Oh my god - You don't want to go?
no. no, I don't.
no, please. I'll--I'll see you later.
so you're not gonna go after Rachel now, right?
what would be the point?
okay, okay. So the reason I asked you to come down - Is because... - No, wait, wait, wait. me first.
ever since you got your money back,
you've been taking me to do all these Archibald-y things,
which I love. I just can't keep up.
so I decided to do something for us.
we're going to the opera tonight.
Wow. that is fantastic.
they're nosebleed seats, but at least they're something,
and I got them. So what did you bring me up here for anyway?
well, there's no reason. I just wanted to see you.
and then "the queen of the night" Sings this kick-ass aria, "der holle rache kocht in meinem herzen,
the vengeance of hell boils in my heart.
lovely. - It is.
it reaches a high "f," that never happens in operas.
you know, that's a good fact.
you should talk about it at intermission.
you're gonna love "the magic flute." it's, it's... - It's okay.
you can say it.
opera for amateurs.
if anybody asks you what you thought, just tell 'em, "ist war wunderschien. Danke. und sie?
that's what aus always used to say.
well, that and--and "geh zum teufel,
but, whatever you do, don't say that.
okay, this is ridiculous. Dad
Lily loves you 'cause you're not that guy.
this feels a little different.
only 'cause you're letting it. - No, he's right.
in our world, people say one thing,
but they expect something else. if you can hold your own,
it'll go a long way with my mom and her friends.
everyone can geh zum teufel. I just want to do right by her.
let's talk "singspiel," shall we? "singspiel.
the devil would say,
you're already in Yale. You have security.
now more than ever, you can do what you want.
and an angel would say,
all the more reason not to. You have what you want.
you don't have a perfect transcript.
but you don't need one. You're in.
Ugh! I hate having to play the angel.
I know, the devil is so much better.
so, B, who won?
gimme.
hello. Miss Carr? it's Blair Waldorf.
how did you get my number?
I wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier.
I was hoping you'd afford me the chance to move past it.
I'd like that, too,
but couldn't this have waited till we saw each other again?
that's precisely why I'm calling.
did you know the school has a block of tickets
to the opera tonight?
to the opera? No, I didn't know that.
Oh, yes. it's a gala event, and my family,
who's heard all about you,
asked if you could come to dinner
and then join us in our grand tier seats afterwards.
I don't think that's such a good idea in light of today - Or at all. - Nonsense. we have an extra ticket.
you're not gonna let our little disagreement stand in the way of the opera?
I- I have always wanted to go.
do you have a pen handy?
Yeah.
spotted, B hot for teacher.
too bad Miss Carr
doesn't remember the devil is in the details.
what do you say the boathouse in central park?
we meet at 6: 30 and walk over for curtain at 8: 00.
thank you. Sounds wonderful.
Yes. yes, it does.
so if you get into Yale...
you go to Brown--you did still apply there, right?
Yeah. - That means two trips for us.
or one. We could go to Providence first,
and then hit new haven on the way back, and stop
at the Newport creamery on the way down for milkshakes.
Oh, my gosh, we could take a week. We could take our time.
new England is so lovely in the fall.
we could bring Jenny and Eric.
that sounds great. - I can't wait.
box two. row two. two for you.
Thanks.
you know what? uh, if you'll excuse me?
uh, no, thank you.
uh... am I glad to see you.
Serena and I had to meet up with our parents before we got here,
and it went from "family ties" to Faulkner...
Ooh. in one cocktail flat.
uh, hey, you excited about your box?
my what? - Oh, we're on the third tier, actually. yeah.
it's, um, a better view and straight on.
third tier's awesome.
what's going on here? - Nothing, nothing's going on.
okay, so there might be some other seats
available to us.
Lily. didn't know you'd be here.
who's your lucky escort this evening?
someone you picked up at the funeral?
this is Rufus Humphrey, the man I'm seeing.
you remember Pauletta Cho?
she's head of publicity for my company. - Our company.
Yes, hi. it's nice to see you, Pauletta.
but your choice of companion, not so nice.
I'm here to keep an eye on him more than anything else.
hope you both enjoy the show.
and if not, you can ponder why
you thought coming here together was a good idea.
enjoy "tristan und isolde."
okay.
this isn't "the magic flute"? - Oh, no.
that opera ended weeks ago,
and it's mainly for kids.
Ah, kids. you gotta love 'em. yeah.
they do such great things,
like misread the opera calendar.
Bruce, hello.
Hey, my condolences about Bart.
I- I haven't wanted to call.
I- I didn't want to be a bother in your--your time of grief.
uh, well, now that you're here,
what do you want me to do
about those, uh, documents I'd been working on?
um... could you wait here for just a moment?
what's going on? - I just need to talk to Charles.
um, you two can just talk about
opera while I'm gone.
the answer is so simple. how could I have forgotten it?
any chance you could try and forget me?
just meet me back here in 15 minutes.
and if you don't like what I suggest,
I won't bother you again. you have my word.
you don't have any binoculars, do you?
Oh, or how about those cool little spy glasses?
or a telescope.
all right, I get it.
you want to go to the stupid box.
not if you don't want to.
once the show starts,
I'm sure it'll be great from up here. yeah.
candy, Dear?
you know, it's not that
you don't want to go to the same college as me.
it's not?
no. a lot of couples go to different schools.
but, you know, for months,
you acted like going to Yale together was what you wanted.
well, I didn't figure it out until today.
and Brown is just a better fit for me, Dan.
well, and what about us? I mean, do we still "fit"?
well, it's--it's not like we have to decide anything now.
we can just
what? we can go on having you make choices
that affect both of our lives
without you talking to me?
look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I was just-- I was so happy about Yale.
if we went together, you know,
we'd get four years away
from--from everything and from...
everyone.
but it looks like our lives are gonna follow us to college,
wherever we go.
and what if our parents stay together?
what happens then?
more uncomfortable dinners?
adjoining rooms on family vacations?
pretending not to hear what we hear in the middle of the night?
I mean, who knows how long that's gonna last for?
well, you know,
I think we'll just have to compartmentalize everything.
the--the two of them will be its own thing
that we'll put in a box and just keep away somewhere.
things don't just go in boxes.
they go all together.
no, they don't.
no, they--they go in boxes with really tight lids
that you bury deep in holes at the bottom of the ocean.
okay.
providence is just a train ride from new haven.
I think we're just gonna have to try and push through the next couple of months.
Yes.
and knowing them, it--it won't last, right?
I mean, it can't.
it could never.
I, uh, studied the wrong opera.
I wanted to impress you and your friends,
and prove that I could exist in both your world and mine.
Oh, Rufus. I don't care what anyone thinks.
you exist in our world, and it's the only world that matters.
thanks for trying.
Oh. oh, god. where are the boxes with the lids?
why don't you guys head, um, up to our seats?
I--there's something I have to handle first.
okay. yeah.
right behind you.
here we go.
darling, turn off your phone.
remember the Kevin Kline incident?
Hello, headmistress Queller.
Blair, I'm sorry to call you after hours,
but Miss Carr told me how upset you were about your grade.
she did? - I confirmed with her
that so long as the rest of your grades
were up to your usual high standard,
that you would still end the course with an "a.
it was sweet of Miss Carr to be so concerned.
she's a good asset to the school.
I think she cares about her students.
she cares about their futures.
have a good weekend. Thank you.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
the opera's about to begin.
it can wait. I have to fix something.
who's this? - Bruce Caplan.
I'm your father's family lawyer.
before he died,
your dad was going to legally adopt Serena and Eric.
and I was going to legally adopt you.
we were serious about becoming a real family,
and we'd had the papers drawn, and your father had signed them.
I just didn't get to it in time. - Your stepmother
asked me to have these faxed over to the box office.
so if you adopt me... - Then I'm your guardian.
give me a pen.
just to be clear, this doesn't make us family,
just even.
what do you think you're doing?
you can't sign anything without my consent.
not anymore.
I'm sending you back where you belong.
you just lost the company.
sticks and stones may break bones,
but a poison pen is the best revenge.
I was just coming to find you.
inviting me to a closed restaurant for dinner?
telling me the curtain is 8: 00 and not 7: 00?
I just wanted to teach you a lesson,
so you knew who was in charge around here.
that's not the way it works. I'm the teacher, not you.
now if you'll excuse me, I'm going home.
I was on my way to find you and apologize.
"on your way" an hour later?
I feel terrible. I do.
and...
as much as I wish I wasn't, I'm still learning.
it's like you not inflating your grades.
I can't not act out against people.
but I'm trying.
so... please forgive me.
I accept your apology.
come. let's see if we can find you another ticket.
I'm actually quite tired.
I'll just see you monday?
Yes, of course.
thank you again.
headmistress? - Rachel?
I'm sorry to bother you.
I just need to talk to you about something.
I hate losing.
you didn't lose.
you just admitted defeat.
you know what's great about a box?
when the opera gets boring...
what do you think you're doing?
she should ask you the same thing.
it's what Bart wanted. I'm sorry.
so you say. I'm not so sure.
I'm not scared of you, Jack. - You should be.
you're high and you're not thinking clearly.
you need to think
about the repercussions of what you're doing.
I don't think I do.
I just had a full conversation with this opera-goer
about "the magic flute."
and he pretended like that was exactly what he just watched.
I'm beginning to get these society people.
it's all a big game
of pretending like you know what you're talking about.
Where's Lily?
I don't know. I haven't seen her all intermission.
keep an eye out for her, huh? - All right.
Chuck.
as much as I hate to ask you anything, have you seen Lily?
my dad's looking for her.
she said she was going to the powder room.
but that was a while ago.
what's going on here?
what are you doing?
why is this door locked?
you think you can squeeze me out, take away my power?!
I worked for this! I earned it!
Jack, it's over.
stop it! you can't do this! get off me!
I can't? who in this town wouldn't believe that the whore
didn't ask for it?! Stop! Please!
Hey! get off her!
you stupid kid.
Oh, Rufus! - Oh, my god. Lily!
come on.
get off of me!
Oh, my god. Thank you.
my hair is terrible. I mean, not since '91.
if you care about your hair,
you're more a part of my world than ever.
you sure you're okay?
Yes. Yes, I am.
I'll see you later.
I heard from the board that Jack is on his way back to Sydney.
you didn't press charges.
no, I just wanted him gone.
but now I'm the, uh, interim head of Bass industries, - Believe it or not. - Is that why you called me here?
what you did for me last night - Lily...
it's okay. you don't have to feel the same way.
but I do have faith that when you're ready,
you will do wonders
with Bass industries.
what are you talking about?
on your 18th birthday, I want you to have everything.
I don't want this job or the corporate jet
or anything related to this business.
just you,
as a part of my family.
look...
I know what happened to my father was an accident.
it was a terrible accident.
and, um...
if the offer still stands...
I'd like to move back in.
I would love that.
the thing about new beginnings
is that they require something else to end.
Hey! I'm just on my way out.
miss Blair, we must go or we be late.
the headmistress asked if I could come meet her at school.
I figured she wants to have tea
like we did when I first applied to Yale.
what are you doing? I'm just reading the brown catalogue.
Oh, and I ordered a home dreadlocking kit.
wanna meet up later?
definitely. maybe we can get a jump start on your veganism.
have some celebratory seitan at angelica kitchen?
mm, I can't think of anything better...
or grosser.
I'll call you after.
okay.
some endings take a long time to reveal themselves.
but when they do, they're almost too easy to ignore.
Serena calling.
call ignored.
Hey, Miss Carr. What are you doing here?
Rachel.
and I'm taking your advice to come out to Brooklyn sometime.
can I--can I get you anything? I make a mean cappuccino.
well, all I have to do is press "start," but I like to pretend.
that sounds great. yeah.
here, sit.
some beginnings start so quietly,
you don't even notice they're happening.
so you've been on the subway now.
you've made it out to a borough.
how's the city working out for ya? I think
I think I'm getting the hang of it.
like anything else, you just have to make it work for you.
but most endings come when you least expect them,
and what they portend
is darker than you've ever imagined.
I called you here this morning
because Miss Carr told me what you did.
you leave me no choice but to give you detention.
Yale has been notified.
your acceptance has been placed on hold.
if you complete detention to my satisfaction,
Yale will still be possible.
but if you do not...
put that puppy down, Dorota.
what happened, Miss Blair?
it's what's going to happen that you should be worried about.
not all beginnings are cause for celebration.
a lot of bad things begin-- fight, flu season,
and the worst thing of all...
Uh-oh. Is it war?
Yes.
but this one will be different.
I need to wait for my moment, and then I'm going black ops
off the radar, no accountability.
this war, I'm gonna win.
wanna be starting somethin'.
X. o.x. o. gossip girl.
gossip girl here--your once and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
isn't that Carter Baizen?
where were you? - Oh, where wasn't he?
he disowned his parents and took off around the world.
an affair with a student? Me and you? I would never do that.
you were right about Dan and Rachel.
you have proof. Give it to me.
if they find out that I let an outsider in, I'll protect you.
your own father was one of them and you didn't even know it.
don't contact me again.
I'm sorry for the interruption, but I have something I think almost everyone here would want to see.
I'm back at Constance, got into Yale.
everything's perfect again.
I thought you lied to me.
then why were you so ready to believe the worst?
I think part of me wanted to.
it's over, isn't it? - What are you doing here?
I came to apologize. I don't know what came over me.
on the upper east side, all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players.
but once a year, Constance St. Jude's students shed their usual roles and take on new ones for the senior class play.
this year's pick-- "the age of innocence."
I just can't believe this is a senior requirement or that Chuck got a doctor to actually diagnose him with acute stage fright.
should have gone with mercury poisoning.
before "gossip girl," there was Edith Wharton, and how little has changed.
the same society snobs still reigned, only in corsets and horse-drawn carriages.
when I saw "the age of innocence" with daddy,
I always pictured myself as Winona, but playing the stronger, more emotionally complex female lead just feels so right.
Dorota, hairpin.
besides, you're so much more suited to play May, who's so pretty.
uh, thanks.
at last, my life is perfect.
my only problem-- how to relate to my character.
countess Olenska is a ruined woman with no prospects, and let's face it.
I have the world on a string.
of course, the is the odious task of playing opposite Dan Humphrey.
Dorota, enough.
how are you two doing, B.T.W?
I don't know. I'm just trying not to think of him, distracting myself with other.
distractions.
you mean your crush on our director?
Julian is kind of amazing, isn't he?
do you know that he directed- Bogosian off- Broadway in his last year of Juilliard, blah, blah, blah?
you can always depend on Constance to snare some wunderkind.
but really, S. Aren't you sick of brooding artists?
well, he broods in the sexiest way, that is, when he's not looking right through me.
Oh, my life is so bountiful.
I don't need a boyfriend to feel fulfilled.
Oh, my god!
come look at this!
but I do need silence to emotionally prepare for the stage.
what are you clucking about?
Nelly just got in early Yale.
uh, that's impossible.
Yale only accepts one Constance student early a year, and that's me.
she just got an e-mail directly from dean berube.
I have to find headmistress Queller.
Julian, I added the fur collar to Olenska's act two dress.
add fur to the cuffs. Humphrey!
this is an invited dress.
backstage now.
I can't believe I volunteered to do costumes.
Oh, for the days of Eleanor's atelier.
wait. Did I really just say that?
Dan, remember, in scene three, you enter from stage right, not stage left.
stage left, right.
no. No, stage right. - Yeah, I got it.
I just don't get why you want to do a documentary on all this.
are you kidding?
a high school forks out a small fortune to stage a play... - Okay.
hires Broadway's hottest up-and-coming director.
that means you've got wealth, privilege, atrocious acting and the fact that you're doing "the age of innocence."
well, that's just the icing on the cake. - Okay.
but don't worry.
I won't make you look bad. - Stop.
and whatever else, "the age of innocence" is one of the most beautiful books ever.
Ugh. It's, like, the most boring book ever.
nothing happens. Guy and girl want to be together, but can't, end of story.
Nate, the story's in the details.
the simple act of unbuttoning a glove expresses the character's inner passion.
I can think of a lot more interesting ways to express my passion...
Oh, really? - Towards you.
it's good to see you, son.
Mr. Campbell, hello.
I, uh, I'm sorry for your loss.
I was in prague for the funeral.
I would have paid my respects in person.
thank you. - I'll come by the office.
I hear you're learning the ropes.
I'm trying to.
enjoy. - Thanks.
is this okay? - Perfect.
my lucky day.
Carter baizen back in town.
always delight to see you, Bass.
elle? You're all right.
you have the wrong person. My name is Hayley.
what are you doing with this loser?
back off, Bass. The lady says she doesn't know you.
she knows me. I know you're in some kind of trouble.
whatever kind of help you need, you're not going to find it with him.
Carter, I have to use the ladies' room.
get me a drink?
just--just wait a sec.
come on, Bass. Don't cause a scene.
heard you were in Thailand recently.
you should have come to see me in Singapore.
of course I had to leave in a hurry.
how was Singapore? I'm surprised you made it out in one piece.
I'm hooked up on every continent.
I landed last night, well, who really cares what her name is, right?
God bless America.
Mr. Baizen?
your date just exited through the kitchen.
welcome home.
Hey. Jacket over vest and button to top.
Hello? What's wrong with you?
Oh, um, no, it's--it's nothing.
did you see how those teachers treated Rachel?
Yeah. They were like grown-up mean girls.
if I wrote a note, could you deliver it?
Dan, headmistress queller told her to stay away from you.
I saw how they were treating her.
it's-- it's-- it's my fault. I just want to know that she's okay.
Hi, Miss Carr. I love your necklace. Is it new?
uh, no. It's quite old, actually.
well, it's very nice.
Rachael: I need to see you- alone. Write back where and when. Dan hi. I am gonna sit in front until the first costume change.
Jenny, I- I really don't think that... - Thanks.
this is just a dress rehearsal. There are people out there.
don't let the- - headmistress! There you are.
Nelly Yuki claimed she got into Yale early.
there must be some mistake.
I'm sorry, Blair. There's no mistake.
I was on my way to tell you that I received a call from dean Berube.
they've rescinded your acceptance and given the spot to Nelly.
is today April fool's?
though I had previously informed Yale of your detention,
I did not tell them what the punishment was for.
but apparently, an anonymous caller did.
the dean called for me to confirm the story.
I had no choice.
but I did penance for that.
I explained that you made amends, but Yale considers hazing a faculty member a very serious offense.
I'm sorry.
there must be something we can do.
Blair, it's over.
you will not be attending Yale.
every actress eventually finds the hook into her character, even if sometimes life has to give her a little push.
Waldorf, you're holding up the curtain.
come. Now.
upon my soul, it's countess Olenska, parading herself at the opera.
it's a pity.
her life is finished.
but don't worry, B.
when god closes a door, he opens a play.
I need your help.
Oh, did you tell my cousin Ellen of our engagement?
I hadn't had the chance.
Oh, well, you mustn't.
she's been away so long. - Did I miss much?
Oh, no, just the first scene.
Hey, Jenny, you dropped your...
Oh. Wait. Can I...
may knows as well as I do the real reason of her cousin staying away.
but I shall never let her see the least sign that I'm conscious of there being a shadow on poor Ellen Olenska's reputation.
get me Out of my way. I need to make the fat lady sing.
pull! - It's stuck.
no, leave it. She'll need as much padding as possible.
what is your problem?
my problem is a two-faced, four-eyed devious little snipe in a fat suit.
did you really think you could rat me out to Yale and get away with it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
everyone's jealous of me because my life is perfect, and you've always been the most jealous of all.
people aren't jealous of you, Blair.
they hate you.
I didn't call Yale, and good luck figuring out who did.
there are about a thousand people who would relish taking you down.
wanna hear the sickest scandal ever?
remember B.'s lord?
it turns out he was giving the royal treatment to his own queen mother, and the worst part?
B. Knew and ignored it.
how desperate can you be, B?
no wonder Yale dumped you.
who wants inbred legacies?
someone's out to get you, Blair.
it's just not me.
Julian. Hey, I made the adjustment you suggested in the garden scene.
uh, yeah, yeah. Um, good show, Sabrina.
so how does it feel to play May Welland?
well, it feels like my character's rubbing off on me.
may's fiance pays no attention to her, and as for me...
are you talking about Julian?
well, the play opens tomorrow. He's just distracted.
Julian, hey.
I was just thinking, it would be really helpful for my friend Vanessa's document to hear more about your vision for the show.
why don't we all grab a bite to eat?
I suppose it couldn't hurt to, give my actors a little more insight into my intentions.
let me just grab my stuff.
I'll meet you in front.
airing my dirty laundry to Yale and sending the lord Marcus "gossip girl" blast makes you officially my enemy number one.
I don't know what you're talking about, Blair.
honestly.
what are you doing with her? We hate her.
I don't hate her.
she's my friend, actually.
and you just need to calm down.
calm down, Serena?
she got me axed from Yale.
you're seriously taking her side?
fine. But a word of advice.
she will be destroyed, and you don't want to become collateral damage.
thank you.
I've been bathing like the French in restaurant bathrooms all week.
so you've been on the run.
you know, I wanted to contact you.
I felt like we had a connection. But I was scared.
and Carter? - I just met him.
he told me he was rich, so I thought he could help.
please.
look, no one is going to hurt you.
are you kidding?
you know the kind of people who are members.
they're powerful men, and the things I know about them could destroy their lives.
nobody ever told me that once you're in, you're in for good.
if only I could just leave the country, - Start over with a clean slate. - So that's what you'll do.
money's not a problem.
we'll get you a new identity, a new passport.
how?
I know a guy.
thank you.
Hey.
just one question.
how do you feel about Brazil?
scorsese said that he considers "age of innocence" more violent than his films with guns and blood.
Marty's inspiration was "the heiress."
william Wyler.
so you're a Wyler fan? Have you ever seen "little foxes"?
are you kidding?
Serena made me see it, like, what, three times?
she's obsessed with Bette Davis.
Yeah, Bette Davis. I, I love her eyes.
her hair is Harlow gold.
Hey, listen. I'm gonna take off, okay? - I'll come with.
Oh, I was just gonna tell you my take on the play.
Yes, that's a great idea. Don't go, please.
Nate, do you mind? - No, no. It's, uh, it's cool. Listen I have lines to practice anyway, so I'll go now.
so... - you know, Nate's got the right idea.
I didn't realize how late it was.
let me just grab the check.
thank god.
Serena, I know you like him, but as your friend, Julian is the most self-absorbed, pompous person I've ever met.
all he does is go on and on about classic movies, and it's totally annoying.
you were keeping up with him pretty good there.
Yeah, and I'm totally annoying.
Thanks, ladies. Don't worry. It's taken care.
and, uh, it's been a lot of fun.
it has.
uh, you know, all this talk about Bette Davis has-has really got me thinking about my character.
you know, I think I could use some more coaching before the show.
what do you say? - Sure. Say 4: 00?
text me your address. - Great.
so what are you up to?
you mean, what are we up to?
I may not be a huge classic film buff, but I have read "Cyrano."
Hey. Sorry. When I finally came out, you were gone.
So...you were great in the play. I just...
no, I- I meant with Rachel.
do you, like-- did she respond?
uh, yeah. She wrote a note.
all right, w-well, great. Where is it?
um, dad has it.
Mr. Humphrey, I believe this belongs to you.
poor Miss Iowa caught playing Mrs. Robinson.
looks like the teacher just got schooled.
Dan, we need to talk.
well, I've got nothing to say.
I went to see Miss Carr last night.
this thing between the two of you--it's over.
well, we'll see.
you cannot be this short-sighted.
if word gets out about this, you'll be expelled.
miss Carr will be fired for good.
well, Miss Carr is the one who sent me the key.
so presumably, she understands that risk and she's making her own decision.
however grown-up you think you are, you're still in high school.
I care about Rachel, all right? And I'm 18.
so with all due respect, I think I'll decide who I see.
Oh, do go on, Newland.
I do love your descriptions.
well, why shouldn't we make them real?
we shall, my dearest, of course, next year.
see, May is all about what's proper.
you've read other Wharton novels, right?
"the house of mirth"?
Yes. Yes, I- I have.
good, because "house of mirth" was a huge influence on Clayton.
Jack Clayton. He directed "the great Gatsby."
Jack Clayton,"Gatsby."
most critics consider it a failed adaptation.
no offense, Mr. Film fanatic, but I- I don't think the movie was nearly as good as the book.
I don't disagree.
why do you say so?
some blame Clayton's direction, others point the finger at Coppola's screenplay.
in "The Times," Vincent Canby said.
slow down. - Excuse me?
no excuse me. It's just that sometimes my thoughts come so fast that I, uh, I get confused.
sorry. From now on, I'll say a line, and all you have to do is repeat it exactly.
you're quite right.
the film is... impotent.
it totally misses what the book is even about the eternal conflict between the repression of society and the passion of the individual.
you are so insightful, Julian.
I completely agree about the power of unexpressed passion.
you know, you are so insightful, Julian.
I- I completely agree about the power of unexpressed passion.
I have to confess, I underestimated you.
you're quite extraordinary.
shall we get back to the scene?
what was that?
I'm sorry. Just one second.
it's a text.
Yale's hallowed halls have gone to hell.
s. Got accepted, but not for her S.A.T. Scores.
allowing a press release was her only prerequisite.
I have to go.
I- I lost track of time again.
we're late for the theater. Are you ready to go?
Yeah. Yeah.
good to see you, Hayley.
or should I call you Elle?
sorry I ran off like that.
I just didn't know if I could trust you or not.
Baizen, you know I'm not your biggest fan, but you are an expert at crossing borders.
I'm happy to oblige.
especially if it means having Chuck Bass owe me a favor.
but my passport guy--he's a bit of a paranoid freak.
he won't like an entourage.
I understand. Look, you take Elle, and I'll meet you at Teterboro.
it's okay.
thank you.
I'm so grateful.
don't worry, Bass.
we'll take care of her.
I've lost everything.
I'm humiliated and shunned.
they've made me a flesh-and-blood countess Olenska.
you are an actress.
pour it into the role.
use pain onstage.
you're right.
I'm an actress.
no...
I'm a seagull.
no, you're a shameless bitch.
now what?
everything you've done spreading rumors about who I've had sex with, what alley I puked in or telling dean berube that I killed Pete Fairman.
I forgave everything all because I thought one day you'd grow up, but putting out a "gossip girl" blast about Yale and the press release.
Serena, I didn't put out the blast.
at least have the dignity not to lie to my face.
wait. But I'm not lying.
only two people knew about it--you and Dan, and Dan would never do something like that.
I always want to believe the best in you, Blair.
the bottom line is, betrayal's in your nature.
I didn't do it, Dorota.
I believe you, Miss Blair.
and if I didn't, that means Dan Humphrey did.
Vanessa told him about Marcus, and he could've put that out, too, all to get back at me for teacher-gate.
do you know how hard it is to get revenge when your enemy is changing every five minutes?
you need to calm nerves and warm vocal chord. You want tea?
no, I want Dan Humphrey's head on a platter.
Rachel, hey, hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere. We have to talk.
no, no, Dan. We need to stay away from each other.
my dad showed up at your house.
we need to at least discuss this.
people are coming.
it was reckless of me to respond to your note.
what are we doing?
I- I can't help myself.
am I supposed to pretend I'm not feeling what I'm feeling?
you know this can't last.
what can't?
our staying away from each other.
Oh, mother's carriage has arrived.
do excuse me, dear. -Of course.
so what happened with Julian?
we were the middle of it, and then you just hung up.
Oh, sorry. I had to get off the phone.
but I shall never let her see the least signs that I am conscious of there being a shadow on poor Ellen Olenska's reputation.
I'll explain later.
the next day, Mrs. Manson Mingott received the young couple at a large house in an inaccessible wilderness in the central park.
girl, bring me my fan.
Yes. Right away, ma'am.
Mr. Archer and Miss Welland.
at last. I was beginning to think you were so besotted with love you'd forgotten about your old grandmother.
and when is the wedding to be?
thank you for meeting me, Mr. Campbell.
Oh, it's my pleasure, Chuck.
your father s one of my closest friends.
which is why I was hoping you could help me with something.
my father was a member of a club.
Oh, I can get you off the waiting list at any place in town.
just name it. - I'm not talking racket sports.
this is a gentleman's club.
as it happens, Carter Baizen is a member, too.
I'm not acquainted with Mr. Baizen.
yesterday, Park Avenue Winter?
you left right when he did.
I don't remember when I left.
and I don't know anything about a gentleman's club.
the club moves every month.
there are girls there.
my. My,my.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
someone I care about is in trouble, and this club has something to do with it.
now knowing my father was a member, it only stands to reason that his closest friends were, too.
when I go to the authorities,
I'll have to suggest they investigate everyone.
I'm sorry about your friend, but I don't know anything that could help.
have a good evening.
Mr. Campbell, please.
I care about her.
I can't say anything.
the great Uta Hagen used to tell actors, "give birth to the new person you are to become."
well, with act one behind you and act two looming, my friends, you are still in labor.
I feel like I'm in labor.
remember, being onstage is like standing on the edge of a cliff.
what saves you is the love and trust you have in each other.
also, my friend, the renowned "New York Times" theater critic, Charles Isherwood, is in the audience, and if you embarrass me, I will kill you.
now go.
Mr. Isherwood, thank you so much for coming.
thank you. - Are you enjoying the show?
Yes.
what happened to you?
you were supposed to come by and get me.
I'm sorry.
you stood me up and your only explanation is "sorry"?
Nate, what is going on?
Nate, I told you.
your character went bankrupt, suffered total public humiliation.
not that you would understand that.
the characters in this play are smoldering tempests of emotion.
you're as empty as the federal reserve.
Nate, wait.
I gotta go work on my smoldering tempest of emotion.
don't you think that was a little harsh?
directors push buttons to get performances.
put your camera on a tripod.
come watch the show.
what a pretty carriage.
every time I see you, you happen to me all over again.
Ellen, you might be the most honest woman I've ever met.
what the hell are you doing?
Oh, no, but one of the least fussy.
you're trying to ruin my life. - You're insane.
you must know that this can't last.
what can't?
our being together and not being together.
don't try to gaslight me, Humphrey.
I know you're just seeking revenge - because I ruined your chances with the simply Iowa teacher. - And incredible as it may seem, not everyone spends their lives trying to plot revenge.
you ought not to have come today.
I look forward to seeing you.
every thought is burnt up in a great flame.
someone is out to get me, and all signs point to you.
you're the only one who knew it all.
it has to be you.
six or seven days passed, and Archer heard nothing from madam Olenska.
then one day, the Newland Archers received an invitation to dine at Mrs. Mingott's.
may, what a pretty gown.
Oh, thank you.
how are you feeling, granny?
people tell me I'm old and ill, but I feel perfectly fine.
here.
that charm will prove useful when "Beu- Fort" arrives.
I want him to feel welcomed.
uh, beau-beaufort.
right. Beaufort.
granny?
my child, your beauty never wanes.
Ellen, it's been too long.
much too long, cousin.
it was-- it was really great of Julian to let Vanessa film it.
I guess she says he's an amazing director.
is that right? -Nate, that's your cue.
go, go!
Beaufort, so, so good of you to come.
uh, they say you've been abroad.
well, yes. I've-- I've been, um...
I've been, um, you...
uh, they--they say you've been abroad, right?
I've, um...he's always had trouble with this line.
I... you know what? Whatever. Y- y- you want feelings?
well, I- I- I hate these clothes, I hate this play and I hate pretentious asshats who try and steal other people's girlfriends.
in fact, I might just spontaneously punch one next time you get in my face.
I know just how Mr. Beaufort feels working so hard for something and losing it because people are out to destroy you.
well, countess, at least you don't have to go through your whole life worried your best friend will humiliate and betray you.
I hate this fat suit. - Oh, and there's one other thing.
my whole family lost all of our money before my father went to jail for embezzlement.
so I think I know more about humiliation and bankruptcy...
all right, all right. - Than some lame dilettante director.
Oh, what amusing companions. - No, stop.
My...god. -Why don't we retire to the parlor, uh, for some port?
no one gives a damn about the Van Der Luydens, Humphrey.
all right.
Shakespeare says, "all's well that ends well,"
and then sometimes it just ends.
Nate had already ruined everything. It wouldn't have made a difference.
well, I stayed in character the whole time.
you high school idiots turned my play into a travesty, embarrassed me professionally.
Julian, it's Charles Isherwood.
please, I- I can explain.
explain what? I loved it.
the classic interpretation of the first act juxtaposed with the radical deconstruction of the sec radical deconstruction of the second act--genius.
Really? You--you thought it was genius?
Yeah, I did.
the repressed characters melding with the actual kids aggressively expressing their feelings
how did you come up with it?
Oh, well, uh, as soon as I saw all that raw, adolescent emotion, I- I- I knew I had to use it, harness it, spin it into gold.
well, congratulations. I look forward to seeing what you do next.
g-- that's great. Thank you for coming.
Thanks.
that was a whole new level of fake.
I'm going to look for my boyfriend.
good job.
you know, I don't know why I ever had a crush on you.
I'm gay.
Nate, wh-- what happened up there?
I know you're into him, and I get it.
I mean, he's older, he's smarter, and you guys like the same stuff.
I can't compete.
you what?
I came to the gallery today and heard you on the phone.
Oh, my god. Are you talking about Julian?
I was talking to Serena. She was with him.
she's the one who likes him, not me.
this is a total misunderstanding.
well, you know, that doesn't change the facts.
all right? I mean, we have nothing in common.
I like ESPN, okay, and you like books and movies.
the way you say that you didn't even bother to read "Age of innocence."
you didn't watch the DVD I gave you.
you're like a kid who swears he hates tomatoes and has never even tried one.
maybe you should be with a guy like Julian who already likes tomatoes.
maybe if you would put in some effort, you wouldn't be so insecure.
how did you-- - Escape?
turns out they didn't want to hurt me.
they just wanted me to sign an agreement.
they gave me some cash and told me to get out of town.
that's great. San Paolo awaits.
San Paolo? - Brazil.
I can still help you get settled, and we can make a plan together.
Chuck, I am really grateful that you were willing to help me, but all I needed was someone to give me money.
now I have more than enough, and I've already made a plan by myself.
so you were just using me?
you've got a good heart.
you should give it to somebody who cares.
that was some performance.
it was nothing compared to yours.
what do you mean?
you called Yale, sent the blast in to "gossip girl" to get revenge on Blair.
I believed in you.
all your talk about integrity and ideals.
my ideals?
Blair spread false rumors, blackmailed the school, turned my job into a sham with no repercussions.
you're just as bad as she is.
no, you're--you're worse.
Blair is a high schooler.
you're an adult. You need to fix things with Blair.
absolutely not.
you know how you felt when your ideals were crushed?
well, congratulations. You've crushed.
Hey, Blair.
it's-- it's Rachel who's been messing with you, and we had sex in the costume closet, so you can do whatever you want with that.
student sex in the costume closet, is that what they mean by heartland values?
I at least expected a denial.
no. I don't deny it.
well, the headmistress told me my fate at Yale is sealed.
so the question is, how do I make your fate as bleak as mine?
I don't know what's happened to me. I don't know what I've become. I'm so sorry.
well, your punishment is just live with it.
I should know.
it's not easy.
so just so you know, Blair isn't responsible for-- for sending out that blast about Yale.
I am.
you?
Yeah, well, I told Rachel about Yale wanting to put out the press release, and she sent it in to "gossip girl."
but w-why would you do that?
I was trying to explain to her that you aren't like the other girls here and I- I gotta go find Blair.
thank you for telling me.
Hey. I'm so sorry.
and I get it if you don't want to talk to me right now, but the fact is, I come bearing snacks, hoping that we can cuddle on the couch and watch ESPN.
come here.
you're watching "the age of innocence"?
it's heartbreaking.
so are you.
I am a way better beaufort.
I'm--I'm sorry.
I- I know you were just looking out for me.
and Rachel-- well, she, uh, she turned out to be not who I thought she was or at least not anymore.
I'm sorry, too, son.
dad, you were right about this, but I think you need to give me space to make my own mistakes.
lucky for you, you'll be at Yale soon.
you can make all the mistakes you want, with, god-willing, girls your own age.
B. I've been looking everywhere for you.
I know that was Rachel that sent the "gossip girl" blast.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
why would you?
what do you mean?
believe me.
nine times out of ten, I would have sent the blast.
like you said, betrayal's in my nature.
I didn't mean that. - Spare me, Serena.
I don't need a stirring speech telling me what a good person I am.
I know I'm not.
Yale kicking me out is the karma I've earned.
could you please leave?
I want to be alone.
you're still my best friend.
in life, as in art, some endings are bittersweet, especially when it comes to love.
so I know I sucked at the role of messenger, but I found this by the door, so I thought I'd try again.
Thanks.
Dan, I am going back to Iowa, as you must have known.
I am sorry for everything.
as Edith Wharton wrote,"there is no one as kind as you," "no one who gave me reasons I understood for doing what at first seemed so hard."
thank you. R.
sometimes fate throws two lovers together, only to rip them apart.
miss Blair is out, Mr. Chuck.
I'll wait.
sometimes the hero finally makes the right choice but the timing is all wrong.
and as they say, timing is everything.
Hello, beautiful.
what are you doing here?
buying you a drink.
looks like this story might just have a second act.
let's hope it's not a tragedy.
X. O.X. O.Gossip girl.
gossip girl here.
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Yale has rescinded your acceptance.
and given the spot to Nelly.
doesn't that nearly as bad as waking up that morning in Santorini finding you jumped on a boat?
that night wasn't excessively what I signed up for either.
when your father escaped to Dominica,
he can only get his hands of money to get himself set up.
but we don't have any money.
the Vander Bilt still.
why would my grandparents pay us to go live with him?
isn't it just breathtaking?
mom, your art consultant has specific taste.
you've got a good heart.
you should give it to somebody you cares.
miss Blair is out, Mr. Chuck.
I'll wait.
Carter what are you doing here?
buying you a drink.
spring on the upper east side where the winter chill is supposed to be so last season.
but mittens and scarfs are still all the rage.
the best thing you can do is to bottom up and hope for warmer days.
Budapest, Bucharest, Dubrovnik...
Oh, there's nothing like summer in eastern block,
just a eurail pass,
and a backpack full of failed socialist policies.
and Nate, the Vienna state opera one day,
pierogies in Poland the next.
no map, no reservations, just total freedom, and Nate is super excited, too.
probably not as excited as he is about to our day of college basketball.
Hey, you guys, it's my cousin Tripp,
it's my girlfriend Vanessa, this is Dan - nice to meet you - I'm trying to convince Nate here to make an appearance at the family hoodoo this weekend.
lunch today, cocktail party tomorrow.
Maureen will be there. We're engaged now.
I didn't know that.
that's fantastic.
Yeah, well, you missed a lot.
Hey, why don't you drop by?
grandfather would love to see you, too.
you know, I appreciate it, Tripp.
I do. There's just a lot of stuff going on.
okay, I can take a hint.
call me if you change your mind, all right?
I will. I will. Congratulations.
Thanks, man. It was nice meeting you.
Bye. - Nice to meeting you, Tripp.
you - you're gonna skip out on your family reunion?
I appreciate the commitment to the game - No, listen, man,
I'm not gonna go pretend to bond with the people who shut me and my Mom out when my dad got busted.
let's go inside. The game is starting.
Hello, sweetheart.
Chuck, I have been looking for my phone all morning.
I was checking to see if Blair changed her number.
well, if she's not calling you back,
you should probably take the hint.
I went to see her last week.
she never came home.
it's not like our girl to be out all night.
I know something's going on.
this is more than her having her dirty laundry aired on "gossip girl'."
she, um...
she got rejected by Yale.
the only thing she wanted more than me.
that would be painful.
Chuck, she's embarrassed,
so we just need to give her some time to lick her wounds.
maybe I can lick them for her.
Blair, hey, it's me.
now here's an extraordinary new piece I can get from a private collector - I thought perhaps for the bedroom.
Oh, I agree. It's perfect.
Oh, excuse me one moment.
Hello, Rufus.
Oh, I wish I could talk, my darling,
but I'm right in the middle of something.
okay. Bye.
Lily I just want to thank you for handling this so gracefully
the whole Rufus thing...
the whole "Rufus and I used to date" thing?
Oh, god. Please tell me that I'm not putting an enormous foot in my mouth.
he told you, right?
well, of course he did. It's fine.
so you were thinking above the bed?
I think it'll look fantastic there.
I figured out the split screen.
all right. Now we can watch all four games at once.
what were you guys talking about?
are you sure you don't want to go to your family reunion?
we know they weren't cool to you and your mom, but, I mean,
it seems like your cousin is trying to make up for it.
unless he's armed with an engraved apology from my grandfather,
I do not care.
Nate, they're making an effort.
Yeah, sure they're making an effort now.
but where were they when we needed them?
you've told me about your summers with your cousins,
about your grandfather teaching you to sail,
how much you used to look forward to Christmas.
you loved them. Now if you really don't want to go, fine.
but don't pretend you don't care.
she wasn't my girlfriend.
we just went out a few times.
you might have mentioned that,
considering that she works for me.
it was humiliating.
well, I've been meaning to tell you.
you know, it's a shame we never see each other.
are there any other exes I should know about?
my trainer, my accountant...
I'm sorry.
but it's not like I ever asked you to make a list of everyone you've dated.
Yes, well, I'd be happy to make one.
sure. - do you think I wouldn't?
I don't think about it. I think we should just drop it.
let's make lists. - Lily.
look, you clearly have some idea about my past and I'd prefer to dispel,
and this way I won't be blindsided again unless, of course,
there's something that you don't want me to known.
all right.
okay. Tonight, then, at dinner.
be ready.
this has disaster written all over it.
Oh, there's Tripp. Hey.
what?
Nate, you said it was a mansion, not a country club.
Nate... changed your mind.
six times, actually.
Hey. Good to see you. - Hi.
Hey, Tripp.
it's flying low. There must be a hospital nearby.
it's not a medevac. It's, uh, grandfather's ride.
he's gonna be so surprised to see you.
wait. I thought this was his idea.
not exactly.
so I came to give him a chance,
and he didn't even want one?
no. no, no. - Nate, wait. You've come this far.
come on.
Nathaniel.
I'm so delighted you're here.
my boy!
we've missed you.
looks like V is leading a lost lamb back to the flock.
and C. is coming to B. sheepishly bearing gifts.
I would have been here sooner.
I stopped to pick up a little something.
how thoughtful.
Serena thinks you're in some kind of trouble.
seems to me your only problem.
is having a party all by your lonesome.
except she's not alone.
what are you doing with this insect?
having the time of my life. Thank you very much.
well, as much as I enjoy bursting your bubble,
he's just using you to get at me.
ask him about his role as a kidnapper for a certain secret gentleman's club.
I should know. I had him expelled.
Oh, please.
all I did is bring that girl to a waiting pile of cash,
which I understand she gladly took before leaving town...
without you.
Blair... this guy - What? Dishonest?
bad news?
he can't be any worse than you.
I'm the one trying to help you.
help me?
is that what you were doing at your little Gentleman's club while my life was going up in flames?
I'd rather take carter's help.
we hear Carter Baizen's dealt chuck another losing hand.
but rest assured, upper east siders,
Chuck always has a card up his sleeve.
secretary of state Simon Vander Bilt.
governor Hamilton Vander Bilt.
family history of distinguished public service.
and it all began with Johannes Vander Bilt.
he came to America 250 years ago.
found coal in Pennsylvania.
you can understand why we're proud to be celebrating our family's anniversary this weekend.
we started with almost nothing.
finally something I can relate to.
and now all this.
or not.
Nathaniel, let's show your friends the presidential medals of freedom.
Finally!
so tell me, Nathaniel, what are your plans next year?
well, I'm waiting to hear back from colleges.
the only thing is,
when everything went down with my father,
it was around the time applications were due.
so I didn't exactly knock the essays out of the park.
another unfortunate by-product of that regrettable situation, which,
I might add, you handled admirably.
Admirably?
I thought you were ashamed of me.
Oh, on the contrary. I've never been more proud.
you stood by your mother.
you got your father to do what was right.
I used to worry that, um,
you got her looks and his brains,
but you proved me wrong on that.
you're a part of this legacy, too, Nathaniel.
so... who's up for some touch football?
come on.
do you know how exhausting it's been being Blair Waldorf for the past 18 years - all the work, the planning? - you mean plotting?
Yes, exactly. I'm glad it all blew up in my face.
it was a wake-up call.
I was such an overachiever,
I was headed for a quarter life crisis at 18.
Oh, b. you've had a couple of setbacks,
but there must still be a way to get into a great college,
and if anyone can do it, it's you.
no, s. I've learned the hard way.
I can't control everything, plan everything.
now with carter's help, I'm trying something different.
in fact, if I'm somewhere, and I can say, " Blair Waldorf would never do that,
guess what?
I'll do it.
B? B. you have to pay for those.
so call security.
Hey. We have a problem.
let me guess - Carter Baizen?
as usual, you're a step behind.
he's encouraging the worst in her. - true.
unfortunately, my P. I. has yet to dig up an unpaid creditor or a jealous husband that would clear Baizen out.
tell him you want to see him.
Why? What do you have?
just do it.
did you and Blair find anything you like at V. B.H?
well, Blair certainly did. Are you reorganizing?
Oh, no. just reminiscing.
why is Bart's name next to Trent Reznor and the Klauses?
Oh, my god. Mom, what is that? - It's no no. Please don't answer.
it's a long story between me and Rufus.
wait.
you're not showing Rufus that, are you?
well, we agreed to be up-front with each other.
Up-front?
okay, but, mom,
it's gonna take him 20 minutes to get through the '90s alone.
I know. I know.
we got into this tiff because he hadn't told me he dated Bex.
and then the next thing I know, I was saying yes to lists.
and how am I gonna back out now?
besides, I'm not ashamed of my past...
most of it, anyway.
do you think he'll judge?
I think you should just sneak a peek at his little black book before you drop the yellow pages on him.
just make sure your numbers are on par. - okay.
slash? Seriously?
what, there's no penalty?
you want me to call that?
I thought this was touch, not rugby.
I forgot how the Vander Bilts like to play football.
B. S. man. Do you quit? No. no, no, no. play.
I remember my first time here.
intimidating.
I'm Maureen, Tripp's fiancee
Vanessa. Nice to meet you.
and "yes" on the intimidating front.
I feel like a republican at the Kennedy compound.
Oh, don't fret. Everyone loves you.
they're probably already designing the campaign posters.
what do you mean?
I assume you saw the hall o' governors?
politics is a Vander Bilt birthright.
and with Nate's charm and your background...
excuse me?
Nate mentioned you're kind of an activist.
in your community - a documentary filmmaker?
Oh, yeah. Well, I think you've been misinformed.
the only thing Nate's ever voted for is "American idol.
Tripp was the same way.
he wanted to be an archaeologist in college, like Indiana Jones.
now he's law review at Yale and about to clerk for the supreme court.
grandfather can be very persuasive.
welcome to the next 30 years.
I'm surprised.
you waved the white flag so soon.
Ah. Goes down almost as easy as you did.
so it was all just a game.
initially, yes. Though I have to admit, Blair surprised me.
that girl certainly knows how to let loose.
victory never tasted so sweet.
speaking of which, do you mind if I take this?
blair's meeting me at a party,
and it's not the kind of place she should be left alone.
actually, I don't think you're gonna be making that.
what's this? Good cop / Bass cop?
Blair needs to regroup, so you need to bid adieu.
dubai again?
nice try, but I'm having too much fun.
nothing's gonna get me to leave town.
what about Santorini?
do you think Blair will want to hear about that?
the greek guy - Spiros? The greek police?
all of their phone numbers from when they questioned me.
you wouldn't.
I would, but I won't if you leave town now, alone.
there are a few things I could hold over your head from that trip.
but consider us even.
if the two of you think that getting rid of me is gonna magically change back your friend, think again.
I'm just a symptom of the disease, not the cause.
what happened in Santorini?
let's find Blair. I want to make sure she's okay.
Spotted--B. Taking one small step for new Blair...
one giant step towards a strange townhouse.
enter at your own risk, B.
Hello?
we've touched on the weather.
I think we've made a clean sweat possible small talk?
I think we should just get it over with before the kids come home.
I will, uh, go first.
is it all right?
Yes, of course. Um...
and... this is the whole thing?
that's it.
okay. Well, then, that's just, uh...
okay, I'll just get mine.
Oh, here I am.
I'm sorry.
it's just, well, I'm - I'm relieved...
please don't take that the wrong way. Oh, no.
it's just you've dated more people than I have,
and I wasn't sure that we'd be in the same ballpark.
well, I'm glad that that is behind us.
me, too. I'll get dessert.
what happened to you?
it's called, uh, getting to know the Vander Bilts.
turned out to be less "gatsby" and more "fight club'."
don't worry. I'm okay. I'm fine.
well, you'd better recover by tomorrow.
Nate told his grandfather we'd come to the reception at the country house.
Oh, reception at the country house.
that's very blazer and chinos.
do you want me to overnight you a rep tie from bluefly?
Thanks, no. Could you get me something for my ankle?
sure.
so? Spill it.
spill what?
come on, the minute we dropped Nate off, you just -- you clammed up,
and you got that look on your face.
what look? I don't have a look.
he's right. You definitely have the look.
here. Cold. You're right.
when I encouraged Nate to reconnect with his family,
I had no idea it came with such expectations.
and it just sounds like Nate's grandfather lays out your life for you.
they're the Vander Bilts, not the Corleones.
this may sound silly.
it's just I don't want Nate to get pushed in to the family sausage grinder and come out a clone of his cousin.
why don't you just tell him that?
because he just got his grandfather back in his life,
and he seems really happy.
and the last thing I'd want to do is say something that might keep them apart.
Nate's a pretty understanding guy when he's not maiming people on the football field.
so if you're worried, yeah, you should just tell him.
what do you mean, she's not here?
she went to that party alone?
look, you have to tell us where she is.
I am sorry, but miss Blair very specific no tell mr. chuck.
but if Mr. Chuck come, tell him Mr.Carter is more attentive to a woman's-- enough.
I'm not going to play where's Waldorf all night.
how much is it gonna cost? How much?
Dorota, Dorota, please.
can't you see that Blair has changed?
Yes.
it is old miss Blair then new miss Blair, like it was old miss Serena,
now new miss Serena.
very hard to keep track. Okay. Okay.
Blair is at a party right now alone with some very bad people.
we just want to help her.
please.
I know grandfather's pretty strong-willed,
but if you're worried I'm gonna be pushed into anything, don't be.
because I am really happy that you've reconnected with your family.
Hey, hey, hey. Nothing's gonna change.
hold on just one second. Hey, Tripp. What's going on?
wait. Where, in the city?
I'd love to, but I'm on a date right now.
Yeah.
all right, just tell grandfather I said I'm sorry.
all right, thanks, man. Bye.
you should go meet them.
but we're eating pierogies.
we'll do the real thing this summer in Warsaw and Moscow and Budapest.
summer pierogie tour.
I can't wait.
okay.
don't forget we have the party tomorrow.
okay.
Bye.
have fun.
may I help you?
great.
looks like Polanski's in town.
please don't do this. - Blair.
Chuck? What are you doing here?
miss Waldorf, as I was saying,
I met with you as a favor to your headmistress.
but Sarah Lawrence cannot accept someone who has hazed a teacher.
but, Dean Wheeler, that was a 1- time mistake, - an aberration. - Dean Wheeler?
looks like we may have made an error.
colleges stopped accepting applications months ago.
please? I don't have any other options.
I'm sorry, but you have my answer.
B. B. why didn't you tell us?
what, that I was coming to debase myself by begging to be accepted at Sarah Lawrence?
gee, you're right. Why didn't I update my facebook page?
it's nice to know the old Blair is still in there somewhere.
I knew you wouldn't give up.
you're wrong. I just did. Don't follow me!
poor b. Couldn't spin this one in her favor.
looks like now she's spinning out.
why are we crashing Nate's family reunion?
and why would Blair be here?
well, Dorota tipped me off. She's coming.
maybe she's ready to relaunch herself into blue blood society.
Blair!
Hey, you--you look great. - I feel great.
Why?
because I realized that while we can't tear out a single page of our life,
we can throw the whole book in the fire.
george Sand. She understands me.
and what better place to go up in smoke than in - front of the cre of New York society? - Blair Waldorf.
how are you, dear?
I heard you've rejected the Colony club.
too stuffy for my taste, as well.
that's because your tastes include sleeping with your driver and popping prescription meds.
okay, not good.
not good - like Dan having sex with Rachel Carl in the costume closet during the school play, not good?
by the end of tonight,
the old Blair Waldorf will be dead.
and buried with no chance of resurrection.
Hey, you, garn with the bubble butt.
Oh, wow. That was...
Yeah. Go find Dan.
I'll make sure this social eulogy doesn't get out of hand.
Thanks, Chuck.
security check? I can't even put my lipstick in here.
what could I possibly be trying to sneak in?
I don't know. Liberal agenda?
universal health care? Education reform?
increase in the estate tax?
I see you got my delivery.
Ah, yes, I did. Thank you. It fits perfectly.
of course it does. Glad you could join us again, Daniel.
I hope we weren't too hard on you yesterday. - Oh, no, no.
I've always wanted a football injury to impress the ladies with.
touch football injury?
would you two mind if I borrowed him for a while?
no, you two go and talk and we'll, um, catch up with you later.
drink? - Drinks.
you think the Humphreys have a crest?
maybe something Jenny could stitch on to one of my cardigans?
and, uh, don't forget the egg rolls.
very important.
all right, thanks.
Lil?
do you have, uh, cash for tip?
Rufus, do you need something?
how about the truth?
Vanessa.
Tripp. You look like you're having fun.
top-shelf all the way.
so you excited for Nate's big adventure this summer?
he told you about our backpacking trip?
I was talking about the internship at the mayor's office.
it's why William wanted Nate to meet him last night.
you didn't know.
there must be a misunderstanding.
Nate and I are traveling this summer.
I - I guess there must be.
anything you want to say to me?
who told you?
Tripp.
now here's the part where you tell me that you told your grandfather you already made plans for the summer.
look, I haven't made any decisions yet. - No, you haven't.
your grandfather made this decision for you. - It's not like that.
then tell me what it's like,
because two days ago you were so excited to get away from everything, just the two of us.
I know, and I still am, okay?
but it is an amazing opportunity.
for what? To turn into Tripp?
is that who you wanna be in five years?
I don't know who I want to become in the next five years.
that's the point.
if this is something I honestly thought you wanted,
I'd be happy for you.
but can you really tell me this isn't about what William wants you to do?
as opposed to what you want me to do?
I didn't mean that.
it's just...
my grandfather believes in me.
Oh, Blair. - What are we talking about?
it's good to see you, Blair. Is your mother here?
no. It's a shame, though.
she should be here to see this.
Oh, you must have her call me.
gerald and I just got engaged,
and I need an Eleanor Waldorf - design for the big day. - Aw. Sure.
though, I think she discontinued her "third-trip-down-the-aisle- only-took-the-plunge- for-money" line.
Oh, Blair. I think you've had too much to drink.
Oh, you would know. Three D. U. I. S now, is it?
now that I blame you.
her way to escape the whispers that you made your money in adult entertainment web sites.
Bye.
big fan of your sites.
you about done?
no.
what are you doing?
trying to destroy the old you, burn every bridge?
it won't help. Believe me. I've tried.
well, maybe I should head up to the roof,
make it a little more dramatic.
this isn't you.
how do you know?
I know you better than I know myself.
Oh, right.
you can see right through me...
can't you, Chuck?
right to my core.
do you remember the first time you saw the real me?
the Blair that danced for you that night at Victrola?
the Blair with none of the hang-ups, none of the frustrations-- that's the Blair right here.
take me now.
Why?
to prove that nothing matters.
no.
this isn't you.
it's not the Blair I want.
that's right.
and I never will be again.
the danger with calling someone's bluff is that even if you win...
good-bye, chuck.
you risk them walking away from the table for good.
and who wants to play with themselves?
what are you doing out here?
I don't know.
well, here.
take that.
do you remember the first time you brought me here?
when we first started dating?
we were, like - 12 or 13.
we used to talk about our future.
how perfect everything would be.
remember?
Yeah.
what happened?
when did...
everything get so screwed up?
this isn't how it's supposed to be.
I don't know who I am anymore, what I'm supposed to do.
I feel so...lost.
do you remember when you used to make us watch your favorite movies over and over again?
like "tiffany's" and "holiday"?
it used to drive me nuts.
is this a pep talk?
well, I finally asked you why you liked watching movies you've already seen,
and you remember what you said?
I like knowing how things are gonna turn out.
exactly.
you know, growing up, I never knew who I was supposed to be...
so I'd spend all my time apologizing for the privilege and the wealth and the opportunities I felt other people deserved more than I did.
and you know what I'm finally learning?
you can't fight against who you are.
and you are Blair Waldorf.
what happened to the Nate Archibald who just wanted to get high and play "halo"?
I don't know.
well, I better, um, I better head inside.
Nate.
don't forget your jacket.
thank you.
Serena, hey. How are-- Whoa. Whoa. What was that for?
I don't know, Newland Archer. Try to rack your brain a little.
Blair told you about me and Rachel.
and the costume closet, yes.
well, you and I were broken up.
Oh, so that makes it okay to have sex with a teacher?
she wasn't my teacher.
no, she was mine,
and you slept with her at school, during a play,
with me probably 20 feet away.
okay, right. Yeah.
Yeah, when you put it like that... mm.
what?
why are you smiling?
I don't know. I am mad, but that was invigorating.
well, that's good.
it's good to know that you enjoy hitting people.
Oh, and look. That's wonderful.
I'll be sure to check that out On bitch slapped again. Come later.
let's go, get you ice.
this looks great. And you remembered the egg rolls.
make sure I only eat a few.
I'm gonna feel guilty.
not likely.
okay. Enough. What's going on with you?
I'm sorry. I was going to tell you.
let's just pretend like this never happened.
that's obviously what you wanted.
that's not fair. - No kidding,
which is why I didn't show you some condensed version of my list.
your list was a dozen people.
how much more condensed could it have been?
13, and I'm not embarrassed about my past.
no, you're just embarrassed about mine.
when you saw the condensed version,
you told me you were relieved.
so... I think we found out everything we needed to know about each other.
Hey. I've been looking for you.
about before, what I forgot to tell you is...
I believe in you, too, just... a different you.
ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
as we celebrate our family's past this weekend,
we also look to its future.
our grandson, Nathaniel,
is graduating from St. Jude's this year,
and, I'm proud to announce,
has been offered an internship in the mayor's office.
Nathaniel? - I'm sorry.
well, our family has many traditions.
some, like touch football,
come at a steeper price than others.
but what they all have in common is commitment to bringing out the best in yourself?
your potential, even if you're not sure what that is.
I hope to find out...this summer in the mayor's office.
Yes. That's what I wanted to hear.
how about that?
call your travel agent, kiddies.
looks like Nate Archibald traded in a summer of love for a one way tickets of legacy.
Hey. You left early. What happened with Blair?
Chuck?
okay. Fine. Have fun drinking by yourself.
I'm losing her.
well, then fight for her. She did for you.
I tried.
I failed.
well, then try again.
she's scared, Chuck.
her plan hasn't worked out for her,
and she doesn't know what's gonna happen next.
if you want to be back in her life, make her feel safe.
you know what to say.
I can't believe you guys broke up.
we didn't exactly break up. Or maybe we did. I don't know.
I just left. It was bad, whatever it was.
welcome to the world of upper east side grandparents.
I've gone up against them myself,
and they're a lot tougher than they look.
so what do I do?
well... just give him some space.
I mean, he needs time to work through everything.
okay.
Yeah, space is key.
I mean, you guys belong together.
God, I'm hungry.
why do rich people insist on tiny food?
well, that's how they stay rich. They only buy small food.
okay, music.
Hey, listen.
it's gonna be okay.
I thought you'd left.
I did.
well, why don't you try it again?
maybe this time it will take.
I made a new list.
it's not what you think.
Murphy's 2 - for - 1 Fridays?
romance novels, Sonoma cabernets,
Christmas tree ornaments...
that's the only list I need to know......
things that you make you happy or sad or crazy.
although that last one would be kind of hard to condense.
just know that I'm - I'm sorry.
Why?
this whole thing was my fault.
I'm the one that wanted to open the door to the past.
well, consider it closed.
I don't get it.
I mean, I know you were married for 18 years,
but you were the lead singer of a not entirely unpopular band,
and I remember beautiful girls throwing themselves at you every night.
that's true...
but the majority of that time, I was pining for...a certain blonde photojournalist.
springtime - a season for rebirth and new beginnings.
for some, it's a chance to turn over a new leaf...
I told doorman no visitors.
Mr. Chuck...
it's late.
I just need a moment of her time.
miss Blair asleep.
I'm sorry.
can you tell her that I stopped by and that I have something I need to tell her?
I will, in morning.
thank you for making sure I got home okay.
you're welcome.
I just want to make sure you're fine, which you are, so...
I should go.
wait.
for others, it's the surprise of seeing something bloom.
stay.
but for yours truly,
it's a reminder that on the upper east side,
everything old can be new again.
gossip girl here -- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
take me now.
Why?
to prove that nothing matters.
that's not the Blair I want.
what are you doing with this insect?
having the time of my life, thank you.
Serena is in "women's wear daily " with Poppy Lifton.
remember when we were Savannah and Svetlana.
I totally forgot about Savannah and Svetlana. - Svetlana.
andrew got caught in a riptide.
Yeah, if we had known, we wouldn't have even bothered you.
is it over? - We've already lost one son.
we weren't losing another.
so you excited for Nate's big adventure this summer?
he told you about our backpacking trip?
I was talking about the internship at the mayor's office. I should go.
wait. Stay.
mornings are simply more fun on the upper east side.
our favorite things to wake up to - the sun in the sky, the nikkei on the rise and a wake-up call from your latest lover or your best friend.
again, Serena?
good. You're up.
Yes, I'm up, just like I was up yesterday and the morning before that.
Te, afr the whole Carter / Chuck thing, you can't blame me for wanting to check in on you.
and as much as I appreciate the concern, S.
my downward spiral is on the upturn.
I'm at home in my P. J.S, eating French toast with Dorota.
come on!
what was that?
get off the phone!
Dorota has a cold.
Dorota, I told you not to use your handkerchief at the table.
it's disgusting.
Oh, it sounded like a car horn. It must have been on my end.
where are you?
I'm on 73rd and Madison, headed to Via Quadronno to get some pastries for our new-family breakfast.
well, uh, if I wasn't so full on French toast, I would ask you to bring me one.
see you at school.
and tell Dorota to feel better.
I have here in my hands my first fan letter.
what, did you write it yourself?
no. No.
'the New Yorker" forwarded it to me. Some kid read my story.
he loved it.
sent me his own story. I mean, he wants my opinion.
but I figured it'd be good practice for Yale since they make you do a crit with your classmates.
Oh, a fan that gives homework. Lovely.
what's this?
it's my entry packet from Yale.
it came, too.
there's just a couple of forms for you to fill out, and then we're done.
look at us.
everything's working out.
you're in Yale and Jenny might actually make it to 16.
that was a little touch-and-go there for a while.
Yes, but I still have 24 hours to mess up, so... uh, dad, I don't smell coffee.
Yeah, and the waffle iron is cold.
Oh, yeah. Lily's doing breakfast today.
she wants to talk to us.
ominous. - Or delicious.
I mean, do you know how many types of jam they have there?
come on. We're gonna be late.
a lot.
I'll be there in a second.
would you care to read my fan letter in person?
as happy as I am for you, I'm a little freaked out.
I gave Nate a week to call, and he hasn't.
well, if I remember right, you left him alone at a party where he was being honored.
which I feel terrible about. I just wish he would give me a chance to apologize.
Oh, he will, when he ready.
okay.
did you just set me up?
what do you mean? - Nate just sent me an e-mail.
he wants me to meet him at his place in a half-hour.
Really?
well, that - I mean, I was just winging it, but that's good.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, it's so good to see you.
I was beginning to think we weren't running in the same circles anymore.
it's been so long.
cute coat.
Oh, thanks. You - you look great.
I love your hair and your tan.
Oh, we just got back from Spain.
"we"?
Yeah, me and my new boyfriend Gabriel. He's so wonderful, Serena. You'd love him.
I - d love to meet him.
you should.
but we're only in town for 48 hours, though.
Gabriel had to come in for business, but we're gonna fly right back to Costa Brava on Sunday morning.
so what about you?
what's new? Seeing anybody?
uh, yeah. Dan and i got back together, but then we broke up again.
Oh, I'm sorry.
and your friend - what's her name? Blair?
Yeah.
how's she doing?
uh, good now. There was this thing between us, but then we worked it out, so...
well, it sounds like everything's exactly the same as it was last time I saw you.
makes catching up easier, though, right?
Yeah.
I - I'm throwing a party this weekend.
Really? Oh, what's the occasion?
not that you need one.
Oh, it's - it's for a friend. It's for her sweet 16.
That's...sweet.
Yeah. Uh, you should come.
Yeah. I'll, um, I'll have to check my schedule, but I'll let you know.
Yeah. Please - please do.
okay.
well, um, have fun with your little party, and, um, just take care of yourself, okay?
Lily, I can't believe you made us breakfast.
Oh, I just toasted some bagels and fried some bacon.
and bought jam.
Oh, really, it's no big deal.
well, if you turned on a burner, Lily, it's a big deal.
you are really committed to making this family work.
I'm proud of you, mom. - Thank you.
Oh, Charles, are you staying for breakfast?
I have an appointment.
what does Chuck Bass do at 8: 00 A. M?
it's not like you work out.
I do my cardio in the evenings.
morning is for business, for which I am late.
so if you'll excuse me... - does this feel like a sitcom to anybody else?
it feels like a reality show.
good.
so I can vote you off.
it would almost be scary if it wasn't wearing plaid.
um, wait, wait. You guys didn't start without me, did you?
you didn't tell her yet.
no. - What? Tell me what?
well, we wanted to tell you in person, all of you.
we are planning a sweet 16 party for you here, tomorrow night.
fantastic caterer and beautiful flowers.
D. J. The perfect guest list.
we wanted it to be a surprise, though.
we heard you had one of those last year, and it didn't go so well.
Oh, jenny cake.
well, that's why this year, I was more than happy to delegate to people who know better.
so what do you think?
I...
you're not excited?
no, I am.
I totally am.
but... okay, look, last year, I would have killed for a party like this.
but this year, I - I don't know.
things just - things just seem different.
like - like, okay, I was just kind of hoping that it would be us and Vanessa and Jonathan, and then I don't even maybe those two girls from my Chem class who didn't light my hair on fire that one time.
I'm sorry. Is that okay?
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, well, maybe you should just try the cake first.
of course it's okay. It's your birthday.
it's whatever you want.
Yeah, yeah. No, it's not a problem.
I'll - I'll just - I'll cancel.
I'm thinking my famous chili.
maybe some board games.
Yeah. Yeah. Um, but really, thank you so much for thinking of me.
it means a lot.
um, I'll just go cancel the caterer.
I should probably get to school.
I don't understand why she wouldn't want it.
every culture in the world has some version of a sweet 16 party.
it's like a universal rite of passage.
well, since she got back to Constance, Jenny hasn't exactly made a lot of friends.
you know, downsizing the party might have something to do with the fear that no one will show up.
word is out that your party went from 60 to zero in the last hour.
we knew you'd accept defeat gracefully.
what are you talking about?
you canceled Jenny's party to move off Penelope's date.
Penelope's having a party tomorrow night? Since when?
since always.
we were all going, but at least now we don't have to pretend to feel bad about missing yours.
Hey, P.
Hey, girls.
how excited are you about the party?
I cannot wait.
spotted - S. Learning the answer to the age-old question, "what if you were throwing a party and no one cared?
when that happens, don't cancel...
poppy, hey. It's Serena.
you know that party I was telling you about?
I was hoping we could meet up.
I need your help.
make them eat cake.
I see you got the e-mail I sent from Nate's account.
his password has been "soccer" since the fifth grade.
look, Blair leaves his place at this time every morning.
when you're ready to do something about it, you know where I am.
and when you're not from the upper east side, sometimes morning is just the start to a very bad day.
I'm all for you and Nate......
isn't that a bit "been there, done that, got dumped twice"?
Nate and I are purely platonic.
I've seen you leave his place in the morning.
Oh, of course. you're stalking me.
you know, if you were any good at it, were any good at it, you would know I bring him breakfast.
we're just friends. We haven't shared so much as a kiss, even.
friends?
that makes total sense.
there's no spark between you two, never was.
you're like a green twig and a soggy match, a rusty hammer and an icy nail.
Nate and I have... had plenty of spark.
better than that - fireworks.
that was us.
Chuck... don't act like I didn't fight for you.
I did--hard, and for a long time.
so please, forgive me if now that we're over, I'm exhausted.
so what, you're with Nate because it's easy?
I'm not with Nate.
but if I was, what's wrong with easy?
maybe it's easy because it's right.
Oh, really? Is that why Nate is so reluctant to break things off with Vanessa?
you do know they're still dating, right?
try this.
yeah? - Wonderful.
Hey, is the, uh, Yale packet around, dad?
I just--I wanted to look at the dorms.
Oh, jeez. I - I think I left it at Lily's. Sorry.
Oh, okay. That's all right.
I'll just get it tomorrow.
but, uh, let me know if you two need help.
why did you just lie to him?
the packet's right there.
Dan was denied... financial aid at Yale.
funds are limited, and these days, there are a lot of other students that need it more than we do.
I'm sorry.
do you have savings?
of course, but I-I planned on at least part of his tuition being subsidized.
well, um, I mean, I could help you out.
thank u, but no.
as kind as it is for you to offer, I think I need to handle this on my own.
I just wish I had an idea.
well, you could sell the loft, and then you'd have, um, enough for Dan's tuition and then some.
and this is where Dan and Jenny grew up.
besides, where would we live? On the streets?
well... you could move in with me.
that's a big step, Lil.
I know.
but always saw it as the next one for us anyway.
are we ready for that?
well, there's one way to find out.
look, why don't you just talk to an agent and see what they say?
you know what I was just thinking?
Jennifer Aniston is totally fine now.
I'm sure Brad doesn't even feel bad anymore.
okay.
I mean, I'm sure that there was some collateral damage, which is always sad, but his fate lay with Angelina, and he knew that, so he had the tough conversation and moved on.
this is your way of saying I should break up with Vanessa?
so me and you can... - embrace our fate.
Yes. - Okay.
well, I wasn't actually gonna tell you this till afterwards, but Vanessa called a couple hours ago, and she just wants to talk, so I asked her to meet me for dinner.
but can't you just text?
no.
but what if when you see her, there's sparks or fireworks, even?
you know, they say breakup sex is......
Vanessa and I - it feels over, and I'm sure she's gonna tell me the same thing.
listen, I promise I'll come straight over after it's de.
on their first trip to Africa, Bradelnd Angina's lovemaking was so intense, the guards thought they were being attacked.
well, how about I just start by talking to Vanessa and see where all this goes?
sound good?
sounds great.
okay.
Oh, you must be jenny.
s., so nice to meet you.
I'm poppy.
Serena, I wasn't expecting any of this.
Oh, well, my mom wted you to have your dream dress.
we thought Missoni would be right, so I brought a friend to help with the selection.
so what about that one?
well, I wish I was the kind of girl who was having the kind of party where I could wear this kind of dress.
I'm not, so... I - I think - I guess I'll just - I'll just try this one.
thanks for meeting me.
after I saw you this morning, I felt kind of terrible.
I'm - I'm in a rut, aren't I?
Yeah.
well, a girl like you should be on the arm of a designer at the costume ball one day and yachting around the Maldives the next, not making up and breaking up with the same high school boy and feuding with your frenemy.
