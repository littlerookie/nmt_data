Why? Why do you like teasing me so much?
I told you, I'm not that easy.
no, you're like breaking into Fort Knox.
then I guess you'd better keep trying.
okay, so what are we looking at here?
well, sexual harassment maybe. Wrongful termination possibly.
I didn't terminate her. She quit.
she felt that she was overlooked for a promotion she deserved.
I would have given it to her.
whose side are you on? I didn't do anything wrong here.
obviously Amanda Daniels disagrees.
why would she be willing to spend her money supporting Lizzie?
to get back at me. - For what?
he stopped her from getting a job she wanted once upon a time also.
there is no case here.
you say Lizzie's written down things you've said?
Yes, in a journal. - Yeah, made-up words obviously.
obviously. - Look, it's her word against mine, right?
they'll subpoena everyone in this office. What might they say?
what do you think they might say?
he told me I'd look good with a ball gag in my mouth last week.
yes? - What would you say about my treatment of you over the last five years?
treatment? - This is Jim Lefkowitz, Lloyd.
our attorney. - Attorney?
what's going on? - The lovely Lizzie Grant may sue me.
and you, Lloyd, and everyone who works here may be asked to describe how Ari treats his employees. So what would you say?
Ari has always been gracious and lovely, fair and reasonable.
this has been a dreamlike job from minute one.
and would you say that if you were under oath, facing a perjury charge and possible jail time?
Oh God, I can't do time, Ari. I don't think anybody in my family could.
I'm sorry. - Go!
so do you think others would speak better of him?
worse is my guess.
what do you suggest?
well, I mean, you're trying to bring an N. F. L. team to Los Angeles.
so? - So the N. F.L. doesn't like controversy.
this goes to trial, win or lose, that's over. You know that.
and your wife and kids won't like it either.
I haven't done anything wrong.
Jim, what do you suggest? - I suggest you offer Ms. Grant a generous amount of money to not pursue legal action.
I already offered her a generous severance package.
I'm offering her nothing else.
I'll call her new boss and convince her not to waste her time or her money on this thing.
just make sure she doesn't write down everything you say.
she's right. - Jake!
get Amanda Daniels on the phone.
morning, E. - Morning.
late night? You look tired.
I was up till 10: 00 tasting wedding cakes.
I'm not tired, I'm nauseous.
any sign of an offer for Vince? - Mm-hmm.
how is it? - Oh, I didn't look.
okay, it's incredible.
Wow. Scott! - Oh, and a Billy Walsh called.
Oh, come on. - Yeah, why, who is he?
he was supposed to be a big director for a minute. Never heard of him?
shall I call him back? - No, but call Ari.
tell him I want to talk to him about this. Thank you.
Yes, Murray, I know.
Yes, Murray, I know. Eric's here, he says hello.
Hi, Murray. - He says hi, yeah.
okay, I love you. I really do. Have a good trip.
have fun. Okay, bye. I hate myself. - What's the problem?
he wants me to babysit his house. - He's got a nice house.
he also has two pugs that do nothing but snore and shit.
don't worry about that. Look at this. - What is it?
Vince's offer for "air-walker.
back end? - Huge, and 12 upfront.
holy shit!
I have Billy Walsh again.
tell him I'm out of town or something like that.
did you call Ari? - I left word with his assistant.
call him back, tell him we're heading down there.
we are? - Yes. You can be my eyewitness that he had absolutely nothing to do with this.
I can do that.
Johnny, you've got to stop drinking.
Why? - 'Cause you've been going for 16 straight hours.
so have you. - Yeah, but I'm happy drinking.
I'm gonna keep doing it until I get a job.
maybe you should do a play.
I'd love to, bro, but I can't afford it.
my mortgage rate's ready to reset.
whatever movie I do next I'm making sure there's a role in it for you.
Vince... - And I got your mortgage until you find a job.
and that will be pretty soon I'm sure.
how do you know, bro? I was on a series six months ago.
I haven't had an offer since. Correction...
dos equis asked me to be the least interesting man in the world.
Johnny, this town is up and down, up and down.
you know that. I mean, look at me.
I was done, but I came back.
and you will too. - I hope so, bro.
but for now, let me wallow in my misery.
stop wallowing with my Tequila.
I'm gonna run out of samples. - Boo. What, are you in a bad mood too?
no, why? - You look sad.
I guess he couldn't close Alex.
it was looking pretty good to me.
I closed. I closed.
great, so how was it? - For me or for her?
we know it couldn't have been any good for her, so let's hear about you.
but first, have a drink.
it's 10: 00 A. M. - Suit yourself.
top me off, bro.
so what happened?
I really don't want to talk about this.
lighten up, Turtle. If it's any consolation, this moonshine of yours is starting to grow on me.
great. - Come on, tell us what happened.
I closed.
I did. I just didn't close well.
what, did you pop off early? It's been a long time for you.
Yeah, Turtle, that's no big deal.
no, it wasn't that. It just didn't start out so good and then I couldn't find my groove.
what, you didn't eat it right?
disaster. - I'm sure you're just imagining it.
no, I'm not. And the truth is I've been imagining it for a month.
she is so hot and then finally
I was all ready and I made my way down there and...
what? - Nothing.
something. - You guys are gonna laugh at me.
no we won't. - No no no.
okay, I made my way down there just as the sun came up.
the harsh light hit it directly and it was completely bald and I freaked.
Yeah, see?
I'm sorry. Why did you freak?
seriously, Turtle. I love that.
it's like you peel back the curtains to reveal the mystery of oz.
I don't have a problem with it.
it's just that close up with the sun, it shocked me.
what, you saw a shaved box before?
I have in porn. Just not in 3d.
I've been with girls who were nicely groomed... landing strip.
the landing strip went out in the mid 90s, bro.
it's the truth. Everyone goes smooth nowadays.
even you, I bet. - Smooth balls for sure.
and I hope you do yours as well.
I don't groom my dick, no. - Are you kidding?
it's 2010; You'd better.
do people really do this, Vin? - I only know about my own dick.
and, Turtle, you should only worry about yours.
but listen, you haven't been with many chicks since Jamie.
many meaning zero.
and you were nervous. So I'm sure you did fine.
no, I didn't. I need another shot.
well, I am sure you will get one. - I hope.
well, if you do, you'd better do a little courtesy manscaping.
can't have your dick looking like a chia pet, bro.
can I just get a little support? At least tell me I'm not crazy.
no, you're not crazy. Murray's hard on you.
people get into patterns in work relationships.
sometimes it's hard to get out of them. You'll see with Ari and I.
Why? How's that go? - Well, he's a dick.
better not be a dick to me. - Take it easy.
would it be so bad if I gave Ari Gold a smack in front of all his peers?
Hey, Eric, and...
I told your office now is not a good time. Ari is not in a great mood.
has that whore called me back yet? - Told you.
no, not yet.
I'm gonna cheer him up, Jake. - No, Eric, wait.
uh, Ari... - Hey, Ari.
what is this, the Big Brother program of America?
except who's the Big Brother? - This is Scott Lavin.
so? - I called you last week twice about Vince.
what are you two doing in my office when you don't have a meeting on the books?
is he kidding? - We're here for Vince.
Vince. You remember Vince?
he doesn't play in the N. F.L. but he still makes a good amount of money.
who the fuck are you and why am I wasting my time listening to you?
e, I got a lot on my plate. Speak fast.
we got a big offer for Vince.
could be worth $100 million over three movies.
look, now he's paying attention. - Scott.
Randall Wallace? - And Stan Lee.
why don't I know about this? - 'Cause you don't call anybody back.
I'll call Vince myself. - Don't do that.
truth is we got this done without you but we obviously care about your opinion.
thank you, I appreciate it. The truth is I've been a little under it lately.
N. F.L? - Personal stuff.
Oh wow. Everything okay with the family?
Yeah, thanks. - Amanda Daniels.
I've got to take this. - She's on her way up.
she's on her way up? - Uh-huh.
what are you doing with Amanda? - Nothing.
you hitting that?
look, you guys got to go. This is really important.
I will call you as soon as I go over this very thoroughly.
he is hitting that. - Listen, e, I'll call you in an hour.
make sure that your dopplegang-banger stays off the line. Go!
Hello, Amanda. - Hello, Eric.
get the fuck out. - Don't ever touch me again, you fucking jerk off.
what are you doing here, Amanda?
you called and I thought you might threaten me to my face.
no one wants to threaten you, okay? - Then what do you want?
I just simply want to know if you really want to burn every last dollar that you have trying to slander my name.
slander? - Mm-hmm.
no, I read Lizzie's journals.
there's some pretty horrific stuff in there, even for you.
why are you doing this? - Because once upon a time you walked into my office and you took a job away from me that I deserved simply because you could.
so it's about payback? - No no, this is like arms control.
see, you're like Iran and I need to take away your weapons because you're reckless.
you're smart enough to know it's only a matter of time before I scoop up one of your castoffs and sue you right back.
unlike you,
I had the foresight to work Lizzie for a while.
so I have proof, you'd only have hearsay.
Lizzie's little work-of-fiction journal proves that I'm guilty like Lindsay "blow-han" proves that fame is fucking healthy.
she has recordings of you too.
your voice. - Bullshit.
Oh, it's true. The tapes are so clear it sounds like they were professionally recorded.
you heard them? - I listened to them, yeah, the last three nights and played with myself while fantasizing about fucking you in the ass.
anything else you wanted to say? I freed up my afternoon.
you follow through on this and you're starting a war.
then man up, Ari, because I love to battle.
it's funny, you know.
this was actually less hostile than I expected.
so Vince has been tweeting the shit out of the Tequila.
Oh yeah? - Yeah.
said he started a new company. - That's great.
I was thinking of posting some of the videos.
the cool ones, not the silly ones. - Yeah.
totally.
good.
cool.
better than last night.
what? - I'm kidding.
no you weren't. - Come on, it was awkward.
you think? - I think maybe we just did it too soon.
or maybe we shouldn't have done it at all.
no no no, of course we should have done it.
it was my fault. It was me.
I take full responsibility. - For what?
for the awkwardness. - What happened?
we were having a great time and then the second the clothes came off you turned into a clumsy mute.
I wasn't feeling great.
I don't know, Turtle. Maybe we're just not meant to be like that.
I mean, Sasha said she had the best sex of her life on our Tequila.
I thought it was the worst.
it wasn't the worst.
okay, you've got to give me another shot.
maybe we're just meant to be business partners.
no no no, come on. I will wine you and dine you and woo you and I will blow your mind in bed.
you think?
let me try.
okay.
you can try.
excuse me. Can I have some ketchup, please?
hello. - Hi.
Hi, I'm William Walsh. I'm an old friend of Vince's.
I'm Sasha, a new friend of Vince's.
Billy Walsh. Oh my God.
Vince, how are you? It's been a while.
I'll say. Come here. How are you?
I'm okay. - Hey, Sash, this is Billy Walsh, - an amazing filmmaker. - That's kind of you to say.
I thought you looked familiar, but different.
I've been through a lot and back again.
can I come in? - Of course, of course.
Hey, Johnny, look who's here.
jeez, Billy Walsh. It's like a mirage.
how are you, Drama? - Peachy, Billy.
I'm getting jerked off by the network 'cause nobody can find a idea for me.
you got one?
not off the top of my head, no.
superb.
you seem angry, Drama.
I've always been, Billy. Only now I'm drunk too.
I shot a movie with you. - Yeah, uh...
you know, maybe this wasn't the best place for me to come.
porn stars, alcohol, manic depressives...
I've avoided all temptation for the last 24 months now.
so what are you doing here, Billy?
I came to get back into the business I left behind.
Vince isn't gonna make another stinker with you, Billy, if that's what you're thinking.
no, Vince isn't what I need at this point. - So what do you need?
Vince needs to get rid of Ari.
enough already. - I'm being serious.
I mean, the guy is barely even in the business anymore.
what do you think is gonna happen when he's standing on an N. F.L. sideline spending all his time trying to bang cheerleaders?
look, Ari's got a big mouth but he's done a lot by us.
and he's obviously got some serious stuff going on.
so does Vince and he needs someone who's gonna be on the ball.
are you telling me you can't handle an offer?
you can't make sure he's paid? Make sure he has a nice trailer?
Ari and Vince's attorneys handle the little details.
we can take it to his attorney. We can handle the details.
if Ari's so stressed out maybe he'd appreciate you taking the reins on this one.
come on, aren't you tired of being a pushover?
who's a pushover? - We both are.
we handled this thing for Vince.
we're basically the ones keeping this company afloat.
so now you're back to Murray? - Of course I'm back to Murray.
we do all the work. I mean, the guy is literally never here.
I wouldn't say never. - You wouldn't say never?
Murray! Hey, Murray!
anyone seen Murray, ever? - Are you on drugs?
no, I'm fucking angry, as you should be too.
about what, Murray or Ari? - About both of them.
they are checking out, okay? We cannot.
this is our future, all right?
you saw how we handled this deal with Vince.
you saw how we handled Ari.
we can run Vince and this company without either one of them.
you do realize that I'm marrying Murray's god-daughter, right?
the one who got me this job. - Family before business, I get it.
but you and Sloan are about to start your own family so you need to start...
shauna's on the phone and she's freaking out. - Who isn't?
she says that Vince tweeted that he started some Tequila company and Turtle posted some racy videos about it.
awesome.
no, I did not know that Vince was dating a porn star, Shauna.
no, I didn't know he started his own Tequila company either.
I have to go.
Lizzie Grant. I didn't know that you ate here.
well, I know you don't eat here 'cause you don't like, and I'm quoting, "eating with all the pussy-ass bitch agents.
you know what? I have grown to love my own kind.
are you following me? - You can't prove it.
you would be amazed at what I could prove.
I talked to your boss. - I'm aware.
Yeah, she may use nicer words but she's a much worse person than me.
anyone in this town could tell you that.
that is so funny because she swears you're the worst person she's ever dealt with.
stealing clients... - Have you ever seen me steal clients?
Ari, I have no interest in talking to you.
well, I have an interest in you not sullying my name.
so tell me what you want.
what I want? - Yes.
how much money to settle so we don't end up in court where you will lose?
a writer's assistant on a sitcom once sued for inappropriate talk.
it went to the supreme court. You know what they told her?
they told her that the writers can talk about gang-banging her all day long as long as they don't do it.
I know the case. They're creative.
you're certainly not. So you can talk about gang-banging all day, but you're the only one who's gonna get fucked.
100, 000. - No.
250. - How about 10 million?
don't be absurd. - You think I'm being absurd?
I think that you're whoring yourself out to a witch of a woman who is trying to get you to slander a good family man's name.
$1 million not to sue.
Ari, I cannot tell you how good it makes me feel to watch you squirm.
but you can rest easy, 'cause I've already told Amanda that I'm not gonna sue you. So keep your money.
you're not? - No.
I will make my money because I'm smart and I'm talented, not because you're repugnant.
I think you're doing the right thing, because no one needs to hear about our past.
no, that's where you're wrong.
everyone needs to hear.
I want the women of the world to know how you treat them.
what does that mean?
check "deadline Hollywood.
I'm sure the story should be posted sometime soon, unless you can buy them off.
you sent tapes of me to "deadline Hollywood"?
is that even legal?
sue me.
I thought you wanted to conserve your product.
I want to relax. - You freaking about tonight?
I'm not freaking, I'm just on edge a little.
let me tell you, shoving that poison down your throat is not the remedy.
poison? This is 100% pure agave.
the only remedy for you is storming the hairless beaches.
you're gonna be fine, Turtle.
I don't normally have performance issues.
Yeah, you perform as often as led zeppelin.
you should probably take a cab. Or I can drive you.
you should take a cab.
I like you two as my parents.
Hey, Vin, where's the can? - To the left.
yo, Turtle, you want a Cialis?
no. Maybe.
Hi, I need a cab for 3750 longo.
Johnny, why do you carry around Cialis?
in case I really got to bury one.
you should use kaboom. You get a bigger bang. - Good tip.
e, to what do we owe this pleasure?
turtle posted a video of you and Sasha on Twitter.
I just got reamed out by Shauna.
that was unintentional. I edited smaller parts.
I just accidentally uploaded the whole thing. - I thought it was cute.
a movie star telling guys to fuck like him and girls to fuck like a porn star isn't cute, Vince.
I said that? - Yes.
you did. - I'm sure the way I said it was very charming.
turtle, what happened? I thought the Tequila company was gonna be on the down low.
no, it only went out to my Twitter followers.
you have a million and a half followers. - I do?
Yeah, now T. M.Z. Perez Hilton and just Jared all want to know if Sasha's your girlfriend.
well, tell them she is.
I thought we were just really good friends.
look, Vince, you just got the biggest offer of your career today, all right?
I just want to make sure you're focused. - I'm focused.
I'm focused. Aren't I focused? - Seems focused to me.
you see? So how was the offer? Was it good?
Yeah, it's great. Ari's looking it over right now.
all right. Well, things are happening.
no kidding. Check out this B. B. M. I got today.
e, I've tried you several times at the office.
I would love it if you could see yourself giving me five minutes of your time.
technology is amazing. - What's amazing is that somebody gave this clown my B. B. M. Address.
Hey, suit. Long time.
do you want Jerry Jones?
and you still haven't called back Jeff Katzenberg or Mike Meldman or Tracy Morgan.
I don't want to talk to anybody. Was I not clear?
nobody! I don't care if Justin Bieber calls and wants me to negotiate the rights to his virginity.
I don't want to talk to him. Nobody!
uh, your wife is here.
Hello, Mrs. gold. Ari doesn't wish to speak... - Hello.
get the fuck out of the way. - Oh, I'm sorry.
you shouldn't talk to your assistants like that. - I know, I'm sorry.
what are you doing here? - I told you I was coming by with the swatches so that we could redo your office.
Oh. - You forgot.
no, I... - Okay, what do you think of this one?
like it. - You didn't even look.
no no, I glanced.
baby, I got quick eyeballs. U know that.
and I trust your taste. You have amazing taste.
and I love that. - I'd like you to be involved.
Why? - It would give us something that we could do together.
something we could do... we do everything together.
no, not anymore we don't. - What do you mean?
since the merger. - What since the merger?
I don't feel good. - Why?
because you're never home. Now with this N. F.L. thing...
that may not happen. - Why not?
it may not happen. - Why not? What's happening?
nothing.
I feel like you've been keeping a lot of secrets lately.
honey, no. Listen, let's go to an early dinner, just the two of us. We'll talk about everything. All right?
I'm sorry, Ari. Dana Gordon's on the line. Says it's urgent about Vince.
I'll call you in an hour, take you to Madeo.
just you and me, okay? - Okay.
put her through.
Dana, is this really important?
if Vince is really gonna carry this studio's next franchise, I'd say it is.
does that feel good?
amazing.
I told you I could do this. - Yeah you can.
you're incredible. - Shh.
sorry if I caused you any stress.
it's okay.
I just thought it was your first time.
first time what?
you know, having sex.
are you serious?
it's okay if it was. - I'm 30.
I'm just saying.
you really think I'm some ugly loser, huh?
I didn't say that. - No, but the first time I tried to kiss you you looked at me like I was a venereal disease. I'm cute.
you are, Turtle, and I didn't see it at first.
but I see it now. - Good.
but something was up last night.
just let it go. - Was it me?
no no, are you crazy?
just tell me what it was. - I'm immature.
what do you mean?
I've never been with a girl before who was totally shaved down there.
it freaked me out. - Wow.
Yeah. - You are immature.
I know. I had dreams all night about playing pac-man.
Pac-man? - You know, pac-man.
Oh my God. Is that why you shaved too?
Yeah, why? You don't like it?
no, I don't like it.
guys are supposed to trim, not go totally bald.
Thanks, Drama. So did I totally just fuck this up again?
no, it'll grow back.
I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me.
I didn't have much choice, Billy.
we all have choices and I've made some bad ones.
Yeah. What can I do for you, Billy?
I need you to help guide me out of the toilet like you did Vince.
why would you want me? - Because, man, you were the first guy to believe in me.
you found my first script, you got me Vince, you got us the money. And as much as I was hard on you,
I always knew you were the guy with the good eye.
we can't work together, Billy. - Why not?
because there's too much baggage and past.
pretend we've never met. - How could I do that?
well, essentially we haven't. I don't drink anymore.
I don't do drugs. I don't curse. - You don't curse?
no, I've spent the last three years becoming an ordained minister in Santa fe.
got myself right and I want to work.
you want Vince?
I want you to help me.
I'll do anything... commercials, tv, anything.
I've changed.
still got that Pablo Escobar tattoo on your back?
no, I had it scraped off with a bowie knife in a ritual smokehouse ceremony.
no, it's still there. Some things haven't changed.
but I've got a family now. - Oh, you have a kid?
I've got four. - Four?
set of Irish twins, set of actual twins and another one on the way.
I thought we could live on love, but tiny kids can't eat love.
look, Billy, I'm gonna have to think about this.
you know, Drama was telling me about this network deal that he's got.
Yeah, if you have any ideas, don't be afraid to shoot them my way.
actually, I was already thinking like maybe he's not having any luck because he's too ugly to star in his own show.
Yeah, you've changed, Billy. - Come on, don't be mad. I'm serious.
look, he doesn't have the face for the screen but he's got the voice.
so what, you think he should do radio? - No, I was thinking a cartoon.
cartoon? - Yeah, like"the simpsons" but angrier.
e, Ari's here and he's being a douche.
you hear that voice? How distinct and angry it is?
were you talking about me?
what's Ari want, Drama? - He wants to talk to you.
I got a lot of ideas. - Sit tight, Billy.
Jesus, Billy, you're back and apparently working at the gap.
Hey, Ari. - He needs representation, Ari.
so does Vince. - Yes, he does. Did you decide to start doing your job again?
I close my eyes for one minute and he's dating porn stars - and starting a Tequila company? - Look, Ari...
you look. I need to talk to him. My wife's in the car.
she's ready to shoot me so I've got to talk fast.
I already spoke to Shauna. - Well, I talked to Dana and the director and they're freaking out.
how could you let this guy show up drunk and with a porn star to a meeting?
he took a Vicodin, Ari. And I didn't let him.
how is he doing now? - He's fine.
the studio wants to sit down with him to make sure that he is.
Jesus.
look, is this thing real, the relationship with the porn star?
what? No. - You sure?
Ari, Vince is fine.
where is he? I want to talk to him. - He's out by the pool.
Oh, hey, guys. - Jesus.
Vince, wake up. You have more visitors.
wake up. - Yeah, he looks fine.
drama, will you relax?
baby bro didn't come home last night, and he's not answering his phone. Don't tell me to relax.
he probably stayed at Sasha's.
no, more likely he went on a bender and he's facedown in a gutter somewhere, wondering why his friends and family aren't searching for him right now.
let's not be overly dramatic. - Overly dramatic?
unless he's distributing, this is a large quantity of cocaine he's holding.
that is kind of Tony Montana-style.
Carlos, what I'm saying is I think mark Cuban is reasonable so I think you need to apologize for how you spoke to him.
Hello? He hung up on me.
who cares?! - What's he saying?
he's saying he's gonna raise the money to buy out he his brother himself.
then raise it! How much does he need?
$20 million. - You can start by selling this.
can we please focus on my missing brother right now?
you still haven't reached him? - Nope.
here you go, bend your knees. We gonna do?
your movie star isn't showing, is he?
take it easy. It's 10: 30 and he was supposed to be here at 10: 00.
something must have happened. He's usually very responsible.
did you remind him? - Yes I did.
you were there, honey, last night sitting next to me.
right! I forgot after all that happened.
can we move pa that? - No!
because everyone is looking at me - don't even want to be here. - You're here because of your son.
and no one is looking at you... except for that Siegel kid's who always looks at you because he wanttoang you.
I am not comfortable, Ari. - Neither am I.
some of these people saw you let me walk out of that place alone.
you think I was wrong to? - You're supposed to support your husband no matter what.
even if you're making a complete jackass of yourself?
especially then! - I am very upset, Ari.
as am I. - Do not push me!
Ari, is this movie star of yours going to show up or what?
cause we need to get started. - Yeah, John, he's...!
how are you, darling? - I've been better, thank you, John.
daddy, is Vince coming? - We're working on that, buddy.
cause Parker Sieger doesn't believe that I really know him.
Parker, he knows him, believe me, okay?
tell your dad to stop looking at my wife.
Yeah, Parker! - Seriously, dad, my friends are gonna be really pissed too.
okay, you have now officially humiliated the entire family.
John, so nice to see you. - So nice to see you, darling.
you're looking great.
really. She hates your guts.
Uh-huh.
I say call every hospital in a 30-mile radius;
maybe the police department, file a missing person's report.
he hasn't even been missing 24 hours.
that's what they said about the Lindbergh baby!
you gotta jump on a missing person early or poof! You lose them forever.
morning, Jennie. - Morning, E.
Oh, hey, Jennie. - Hey, Johnny.
what are you doing here? - Nothing. What are you doing here?
um, I work here.
Yeah. - Drama!
you can't bang my assistant.
why, you don't think I could get her?
e, I know we hate each other, - but this is about Vince. - What about him?
I was gonna call you this morning. - Speak, Scott!
okay, I think that Vince has a real problem. - Why?
because he showed up at my house at 4: 00 in the morning, wanting me to hang out, looking for cocaine.
Oh God. - And when I said no, he went fucking crazy.
Jennie, you gotta find Sasha Grey's number - and get her on the phone now. - I'm on it.
it's gonna be okay. I'll call you as soon as I hear something.
and please call me if you do. Okay.
Bye.
that was Vince's mom. - She hasn't heard from him?
Nope. She's freaking out.
so is my dad. I just got off with him.
what's he freaking out about? - He spoke to Carlos.
What'd he say? - He was crying.
Carlos was? - Yeah.
Avion's been Carlos's whole life, Turtle.
it will kill him if he loses it.
I know. - So do something.
Alex, I'm calling everybody I know who has money.
I know.
that might be Vince. Hello?
- Yeah, who's this? - Who's this? You called me.
this is Ryan Howard. I was calling you back.
Oh hey, Ryan, it's Turtle!
I met you with Vinnie chase at the world series last year.
Oh yeah, I remember you. You're the dude that was screaming out and calling me a pussy.
Aw, don't take that personally, Ryan.
you were playing the yanks. When you were beating the Dodgers in the N. L.C. S.
was there anyone screaming louder for you than me?
yeah yeah, whatever, man. What's up?
you just signed a $125-million contract and I'm sure you're looking for ways to safely invest your money.
and you've got a way? - Yeah... Tequila.
no, man, I don't... I don't think so.
don't you want to hear more about it? - No, not really.
but, hey, tell Vinnie I said what's up and to give me a call later.
I gotta go to work.
okay, I'll keep trying.
and call me if you find Vince. - I will.
nice nice, beautiful.
wiggle it a little for me, okay? Okay okay.
okay, now make it pop for me, right down the aisle, right down that middle Lane. That's right, hot!
okay, now turn to left a little bit... Yeah yeah.
Oh, the other left. Right, nice. Okay, good.
good.
can we break for a minute? - Yeah, just a minute.
look at you... hot stuff.
what happened to you last night?
C'mere, give me a kiss.
I woke up and you were gone. - I had to go home.
in the middle of the night? I was worried.
I couldn't sleep, I didn't want to wake you. You had a big day today.
why are you wearing the same clothes? - I don't know, I'm lazy.
and freaking out. - No. Why would I be?
this is just the box cover. - I know, I'm here to be supportive.
which one is he? The douchebag on the left?
stop. - No, really. I'm curious.
which one do you think? - I have no idea. Why don't you just tell me?
better yet, introduce me. - No.
come on, Sash, I'll be nice.
fine. Vince!
his name is Vince? - Weird, I know.
Vince, this is Vince. - What up?
Vince, big fan. - Oh yeah?
Yeah. - Too bad I can't say the same.
I haven't seen your work. - That's too bad.
well, I've seen all of yours. Even "Medellin.
what, are you being a fucking asshole?
okay.
huh? What?
John, I planned this party for six months. I'm not canceling.
I'm only suggesting you postpone for a couple of weeks.
I... - Do you really want to put your relationship on display when it's in this very fragile state?
it's not in a fragile state. We had a fight, that's it.
any word from Vince? - No, not yet.
Jesus. - Hello, John.
I assume you saw "Perez Hilton" this morning.
- Your scene in Wolfgang's got you a very nice headline.
you read "Perez Hilton"? - My girlfriend's 23, I have to stay relevant.
the article also said that while you were screaming like a raving lunatic at Amanda,
Vince and Sasha were in the bathroom...
fucking. - What?
this guy'll make anything up.
I met my girlfriend in that bathroom.
now look, Ari... - No.
John, I am not gonna cancel the party.
end of story. - Maybe I'm not ming.
why not? - The tension between you two is palpable.
I mean it was very very uncomfortable at the baseball field.
for who?! - For whom?
Oh Jesus, come on. - For everyone, all right?
and... I'm at a crossroads with my lady.
what crossroads? - Well, she wants to get married.
John, you've been down that road three times already.
Yeah, but she wants a kid while I'm still young.
you're nuts. - Look, the point is we do not need any tension around us, okay?
there will be no tension.
I think you ought to go home. Go home why?
look, you do not want your wife walking into a surprise party with all your best friends when the only thought she has in her head is about killing you!
go home. Go on.
yo, Drew, it's Turtle. I met you at the super bowl with Vincent chase.
Oh hey, Turtle. What's up, man? How's Vince doing?
Aw, he's doing. - So what's going on?
how would you like to invest in a Tequila company? - Uh, I wouldn't.
even if I told you mark Cuban wants to put 20 mill in real bad?
Really? Now would I own it at the same price as him?
no, see, what I want to do is raise the money myself and then kick Cuban out of this thing.
turtle. - Yeah?
- You were the guy with the hat on backwards, right?
Yeah, probably. - Hey, man, phone's breaking up. I can't hear you.
I hear you just fine. - Hey, man, yeah, I'll hit you back. Sorry.
drew! Hello?
the guy's a dick. - You're the one being a dick.
Really? - Look, he's just jealous.
Oh, he's jealous?
and tell me, what does he have to be jealous of?
he's the one fucking my girlfriend.
he's working and a movie star showed up? He's nervous.
Oh now he's nervous. So which one is it... is he nervous or jealous?
it's both. He knows I don't care about him when we're fucking - but I do care about you. - Bullshit.
cause if you cared about me, you wouldn't do this movie.
Vince, we've been over this. - Let's go over it again!
you do this movie, we're done.
fuck you.
are you fucking serious? - I told you don't fucking tell me what to do!
like I'm crazy for trying to tell you not to do this?
you knew what I did when I met you.
well, it's making me sick. - Guys like you that go and fuck all sorts of girls just for the fun of it usually make me sick too.
but I made an exception. I guess I fucked up.
go home, Vince.
if I leave now, I'm not coming back.
goodbye then.
Sasha, calm down, tell me what happened.
he's such a fucking asshole. I'm in the middle of work and he shows up and acts like a fucking amateur.
I'll talk to him. - Don't bother, I'm done.
do you know where he is? - No clue.
he probably ran home like he did last night.
he didn't go home last night. He went out looking for drugs.
how bad is he, Sasha? - Worse than I thought, I guess.
I'm sorry. Call me and let me know he's okay.
okay.
drama! Will you stop talking to her?
we weren't talking, we were looking at "Perez. " - What's it say?
nothing good. We need to talk to him.
I think he's heading back to the house. - Good, let's go.
Hey, Scott! - What are you calling him for?
we need to call everyone. - What's up?
come with us to Vince's. - For what?
we're gonna have an intervention.
you promised me you would get her to the party.
I know I did, Ari. I feel so bad.
I just can't deal with all the lying, given what's happening.
nothing is happening!
don't believe everything.
Ari, my husband is coming out of rehab next week.
I have enough of my own drama. I can't take on yours.
how am I supposed to get her out of the house?
I don't know. I'm sorry, I just can't get involved.
Marlo... - tell her I say happy birthday!
fuck fuck...!
Hello?
hello.
baby, what's wrong?
what's wrong? She married a scumbag, that's what's wrong.
Marci, what are you doing here?
I flew in to comfort my ailing sister.
she's not ailing. - Yes I am, Ari.
I'm ailing badly! - About what specifically right now?
about the fact that she married a scumbag!
Marci, I'm having a conversation with my wife. I'm sorry.
why are you at home? - Because I want to spend the day with you.
she is not interested.
could you just shut the fuck up and let...
do not speak to my sister like that!
okay, I don't want to speak to her at all. I want to speak to you.
so speak.
I'm sorry about last night. It'll never happen again.
Oh my God, bullshit! - Listen, I swear to God, Marci, - I will take a fucking frying pan... - And call her a whore?
you're gonna bully some more women?
I'm going upstairs. - Baby...
go, just go. - Hold on.
fuck you.
Ken, please, can you just come over here and hear me out - one last time? - Turtle, the deal's done.
we're gonna make Carlos a rich man whether he likes it or not.
how many yachts can you waterski behind?
are you quoting "wall street"?
greed is good, baby!
mark, please, I can't come chasing after you.
there's something going on with Vince. - Is Vince okay?
hopefully he will be. I can't talk about it over the phone.
okay, we'll come by. Can't wait to hear what you have to say, Turtle.
thank you.
neither can I.
there's no stress about eating with your father.
I don't know what you're making such a big deal about.
he is. It's not me.
how? - He doesn't want me there.
what? Why? - I don't know. He's being weird.
my guess is he's gonna grill you about your plans for the bachelor party.
look, I'm not scared of your father. He and I get along great.
we'll meet after for a drink. - Uh, maybe you should have a drink before too.
maybe. - Good luck with Vince.
Thanks. Meeting up with Terrence for dinner.
fun. - I heard he was as big a slacker as our boss when he was still in the business.
I don't want to hear about it, Scott.
you don't want to hear what? - Anything about Murray from you.
I need you here for Vince and if that's not why you're here, then I'll call you a cab.
I think you think you're tougher than you actually are.
I'm tougher than both you guys, so knock it off. We're here for Vince.
let's do this.
yo, Vince! - Vince, you home?
he's not here. - Great. Now what do we want to do?
we wait. E, you want to call Ari again?
Yeah, I'll call him. - You found him?
Yeah, we think he's heading home. - Thank God.
we need you here now. - That cannot happen.
Ari, we think Vince has a drug problem.
and if you're not here in a half an hour, I promise you you're never gonna see him again.
Marci, I am so sorry that I yelled at you. - Pfft.
how about her? - Have I ever asked anything of you?
- I have a favor to ask you now, please.
uh... no. - Listen,
I need you to get her out of the house and keep her out until 7: 30.
why, do you have hookers coming over or something?
not everyone is like your ex-husband.
Oh yeah, that's right. Because you just call women whores, you don't actually fuck them.
look, I have an incredible surprise party planned for her 40th tonight, okay?
I got the caterers coming over here in less than an hour and I got Christina Aguilera singing her favorite song here.
Really? - Yeah.
that's weird, because I'm just here by chance - and I didn't get a fucking invite! - Shh!
I'm sorry, but we didn't think that you would come.
you thought I would miss a chance to just watch you throw money at another problem?
look, I do what I do and I'm pretty good at it.
and I'd spend every last dime that I have to show her how much I care about her.
she wants a husband. She doesn't want a fucking party.
OK... it's a grand gesture. - You're an asshole.
you have been struggling ever since the divorce, right?
three kids and no help.
yes yes, you would think that since their father fucked the music teacher I could at least get free piano lessons.
okay, I will clear your debts. - What?
you get her out of the house and bring her back,
I will clear your debts.
I'll keep your kids in that private school you love...
even the not-so-quick one who had to repeat the third grade.
Why? - Because I love my wife.
and because this night is important to me and because your kids are important to her.
none of you watch "intervention" on a&e?
- No. - Phenomenal.
what we need to do is we need to sit Vince down and tell him how his behavior has affected us.
how it's affected us? - Yeah.
turtle, you go first. You say, "Vince, your behavior has affected me negatively in the following ways..." Go ahead. Come on.
well, I didn't sleep last night, but that was because you wouldn't let me.
are you kidding me? - Honestly.
he's always been good to me even when he's high.
I'm really worried, but I don't have anything negative to say about him.
even if it's for his own good? - Isn't there another way?
I'll talk to him privately. - I tried that, Turtle.
exactly. We all gotta come at him together.
well, what if it doesn't work? - It has to.
Hey, yo, what are you gonna say?
you know, I got some business to discuss with you too, E.
I know now is probably not the right time. - Speak, Scott.
okay, I'm taking Murray down. - What?
Yeah. Okay, I know that he is your girl's godfather and I know that you think you like him, but you do not. He is a wrap.
bullshit. - No, it's not bullshit.
I got most of the company with me.
I was going to tell you... in fact I tried to tell you, - but with your fiancee and our tension... - Scott, listen to me.
that'll never happen. - It is happening, Eric.
- With or without you. - Yo, baby bro's here!
come on. - We'll see about that, Scott.
what's this? - Got myself a present.
for what? - For being me and for not having to answer to you.
what are you guys doing here? - We wanted to talk to you, bro.
about what?
what the fuck is going on?
this is all about a bag of coke?
it's a big bag, Vin.
you guys are joking?
I was having a party and I called our weed guy and I said give me a pound of both.
I don't know how you order coke 'cause I don't really do it.
you're not that dumb. - Are you kidding?
no, wait... we can sell that, bro.
you know you forgot about my son's little league game, right?
Oh fuck.
I was up really late. - Yeah, you kinda went crazy on me.
crazy? - What, you don't remember?
no, I remember. I wanted to hang out, but you were being a pussy.
I wouldn't exactly call that crazy. - You kicked my truck.
I did not.
Vince, you know I came out here for myself, but now I see there was maybe a bigger purpose for my visit.
the ex-addict who I invited into my home has come down from God to save me?
from what? Oh, let's see.
I forgot to go to your son's baseball game?
I mean, why a movie star has to show up to an eight-year-old's baseball game is beyond me.
but hey, I guess that's Hollywood, right?
did I wake you up last night? I'm so sorry.
and what did I ever do to you, Turtle? - Nothing, Vin.
or you, Johnny? - Nothing.
so why the fuck are you all here? Oh wait, let me guess.
e orchestrated it.
e's worried about me. E's always worried that his golden goose - - is going to implode. - Take it easy, Vince.
it was my idea. - That's really disappointing, Johnny.
because I'm fine. I just had an argument with my girl and I'm a little upset, okay? That's all!
I know, I talked to her. - Really? And what did she say?
she said you went crazy on her too, Vince.
she doesn't want to speak to you anymore. - Good!
because I don't really want to speak to her either.
- Or any of you. - Vine... Vince, come on.
no, I'm serious. I'm gonna go for a walk.
and I know you all need me, but I'll call you if I need any of you.
ahem, well, Pete berg's office called and he needs to be at the studio tomorrow for a camera test.
so which one of you losers is going to make sure that he gets there?
you're the most powerful agent in town, Ari.
why don't you make sure he gets there?
- How is she doing? - She's a little better.
but she's... drunk.
drunk? - Yeah, and she wants to go to Vegas.
tomorrow she can go to Vegas. Tonight I need her here.
Marci, get off the phone. You look like my douche of a husband.
okay. I'm doing the best I can.
do better and I will put your kids through college too.
Bye, Ari.
Johnny, I'm fine. I got a room at the Roosevelt.
bro, I'm sorry. It was all out of love.
please come back. - I just want to be alone right now.
- I don't think you should be.
I'll call you if I need you.
hold on.
room service.
coming.
- Hey, Mr. chase.
Hey.
what the hell is up with the music?
sorry about that, Mr. chase. There's a party.
Oh yeah? Any good? - It's Eminem's.
can't imagine it isn't. - Well, I'll probably head up there.
all right. - See ya.
I'm sorry I couldn't say more and let's obviously keep the Vince stuff on the d. L.
turtle, look, if Vince is going to be the face of Avion, then obviously we don't want to hurt his name either.
no disrespect, but you guys are hurting everybody.
this Tequila is authentic because as corny as it may sound - it's made with love. - That's corny as shit.
maybe it is, but you know what? Carlos makes a great product and without him, we're just another brand.
I think he likes Carlos. - I think he loves him.
I don't know if I like Carlos or not, but I think we need him.
I think we could use him. He's a personality. And to be honest, he'll sell the product better than Vince will.
like Juan Valdez did for coffee.
like aunt Jemima did for syrup.
like that "where's the beef?" Lady did for whatever the fuck she was selling.
the only difference is Carlos is the real deal.
Juan Valdez. - Aunt Jemima?
turtle, this is about your girl, right?
this is gonna kill me with her, mark, yeah.
that's a shame, because she's a keeper.
she's too good for him. - Thanks, Ken.
look, Turtle, I like you.
I hate Carlos, but I like you.
so I'm gonna give Carlos his $5 million to build his factory, no strings attached. And if he hits his numbers there'll be more money behind that.
but if you fuck me, you know what's going to happen?
mark's gonna make Gordon Gekko look like Mary Poppins.
I will never forget this.
neither will I, Turtle.
you're not nervous, are you?
no, why? Do I seem nervous?
Yes. A little bit.
I had a rough day at the office.
it's the last thing you need, isn't it, for your star client to be strung out on drugs?
Sloan told you about that?
yeah well, he's actually my best friend too, so I'm really more concerned on a personal level.
of course. Well listen, I've been speaking to your boss.
who, Murray? - Mm-hmm.
he tells me that you're quite an asset to the company.
Oh, I appreciate that. - Yeah! Listen.
you've signed a few clients,
Vince's brother, for instance.
Yeah, we got him a cartoon set up. It should be pretty big.
looking beyond your friends, do you see any growth here?
Yeah, I've signed a lot of good clients this year. - Murray's worried about you.
he... he's not sure quite how to keep you motivated.
he said that? - Mmm.
murray's never even there, Terrance. - He's worried about you, Eric, - as am I. - What are you worried about?
my daughter.
aside from the fact that she's blessed by my credible gene pool, she's also blessed with an awful lot of my money.
right? - Well, I'd hate for that money to give you any less incentive to really work hard.
Terrence, listen, I'm not interested in Sloan's money.
I make my own. - This is great!
it's gonna be easy. - What's gonna be easy?
I'd like you to sign a prenup.
everything looks nice, right? It looks nice.
Ari, relax. It's smashing.
thank you.
babe? - Mm-hmm?
is there any absinthe? - I don't know. Ari?
uh, I will ask the bartender.
and when is this party starting?
Ari? - Uh, any minute.
any minute.
you're... you're really gonna marry her?
she's terrific. The tension's getting to her.
the tension is getting to her? What tension?
Oh, the... "Where's the guest of honor" tension, that one.
any minute, okay? - Are you sure?
believe me I am sure. - Ari?
she's here. - She's here, okay.
places, everyone, places.
as soon as we yell surprise, you start singing "beautiful.
got it. - All right.
is there any way I could get you to listen to my demo?
uh, let's wait till after the surprise, okay?
surprise!
where is she?
can I talk to you in private?
Ari, it's 9: 15. You asked me to do an hour.
please play longer. I can't pay your fee, but I'll give you the deed to my house.
that's still not going to cover it. I want your Lakers seats - for the playoffs... all of them. - Done.
you give me a Grammy-worthy performance and I'll get
kobe Bryant to sing at your birthday.
Uh-huh. I'll believe it when I see it.
what's going on? - She's not coming.
I had to tell her. - What, why?
because she was coming here to talk to you and I didn't want her walking into an ambush.
this is a sign of love. This isn't an ambush.
- I'm sure that's her.
I'm gonna get some of her things.
- Baby, where are you?
I am so sorry, Ari.
honey, I'm sorry. Just please come home.
I can't face all those people.
I will clear them all out.
it will just be you and me. Please, talk to me.
I need a break, Ari.
a break? From what?
I need some space.
I'm going to pick up the kids at Stacy's and go to my mother's.
baby... baby, please.
you're so hot.
we haven't fucked before, have we?
no, not yet.
well, pencil me in for later.
I'll be right back.
Minka? Hey, Minka.
Vincent chase. - Okay.
I'm doing a movie with Pete berg and once upon a time he said we should meet.
okay. - And here we are meeting.
nice to meet you.
excuse me, have you seen Vincent chase? - Yeah, he's around.
where you at, bro?
Yeah, I'd love to, but I have a boyfriend. - I have a girlfriend but she fucks other dudes... lots of them.
so I figure I can fuck other girls.
I thought we were gonna fuck tonight.
Oh perfect... we can all fuck.
you know what? Why don't you fuck yourself?
Aw whoa, you don't have to be a bitch about it.
yo, bro, you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. - You don't look it.
Hey, Johnny, do you want to party or do you want to be a bitch-ass pussy?
come on, Vince, let's go. - No no no!
Mr. chase, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
we were just leaving. Come on, bro. - No no.
no we weren't. I'm sorry, wh... what did I do?
we've had some complaints. - I'm a guest in the hotel.
and this is a private party. - I'm friends with the band.
so why don't you go fuck yourself? - Yo, Vince.
Vince, what up, man? What's the deal?
what's up? You tell this guy I'm cool to stay.
no, I don't think he's so cool.
Oh, look who it is... Minka the tight-ass.
fuck you, Vince. - Fuck you.
yo, chill out, Vince. - Fuck you too.
fuck me? Yo, get this dude out of here before I fuck him up.
wow, what, are you too mainstream now to fight your own fights, Marshall?
what the fuck's wrong th you, man?
fucking punk!
Vince! Stop!
- You honestly didn't know - No - and I can't believe you would think that. - I don't know what to think.
and why did you tell him Vince was on drugs? - He's my father!
yet he didn't tell you this? - Eric.
Sloan, he treated me like I'm some slacker. Like either of them should talk.
they both built their businesses on other people's hard work.
you're upset. Let's talk about this when you get home.
okay.
yo, Scott, it's Eric.
fuck Murray, I'm in.
that's really good the hear, Eric, but we've been trying to call you.
we?
yo.
you're kidding.
if it wasn't for Jordan Farmar and that guy Kevin love, - I would have killed somebody. - Drama?
yo.
fuck! - No, I'm good, I'm good.
how's Vince? - He's not gonna be on camera anytime soon.
Oh my God.
where are you going? - Out. What do you care?
Hey, bro, let us take you home. - Fuck you, Johnny.
- Vince. - Fuck you too.
what's your problem? - You guys are my problem.
I was fine until you guys pissed me off.
now look, you got what you wanted... I am officially out of control.
come on, Vince. - Sorry, Mr. chase, - we just need to finish the report. - Call my lawyer.
I think you might want to take care of that.
Why? - You know who this belongs to?
uh...
they didn't know it yet, but there was something greater in store for them something epic,
meet our first orphan- Lucy,
she had been raised by a kindly old museum curator, - But alas, - Ohh!
he was murdered,
Ow.
Oh, please don't die.
[ grunting ] - Please don't die. You're all I have.
you're on my hand.
Oh, sorry.
it's a code.
but what is it?
Oh, my God! Oh, God! The code! Please! Give me another clue!
I didn't read the book on tape.
God. Um, the code, please.

[Narrator] And finally, our last orphan, Peter,
he made his home among the undesirables of society- the mutants,
but even there he was an outcast,

[Narrator] And forthese four orphans,
life would never be the same,
gross.

I thought this golden ticket was my lucky break.
the curator was all I had.
I never had anyone. I raised myself.
and that's why you have such a tough exterior?
Yeah.
and you're kind a bitchy.
why us? - Because we're four kids nobody would ever miss.
we'll be stuck here till we die.
shut up, Edward. You're scaring her.
don't tell me what to do! You're not my father!
[ laughs ] Two for flinching. - Oww! Aah!
leave Peter alone. He was just sticking up for her.
I can take care of myself.
like it or not, we're all in this.
it's obvious we don't like each other, but if we're going to survive, we have to stick together.
[Grunts] - Aah!
Ow. - Was the fight over?

[ shutter Clicks ] - The evil White Bitch who rules Gnarnia...
has ordered anyone who finds a human to turn them in.
I brought you ba-a-a-ack to my lair to betray you...
but I couldn't do it.
you are a true friend.
she has plunged our once-peaceful land into eternal winter.
under her two terms, we now have...
wiretaps, no gay marriage...
not to mention her bumbling of the hurricane relief effort.
and-and the White Bitch doesn't care about black people.
there is a small resistance movement.
they learned she's developing a weapon of mass destruction...
that can kill all of us.
wait, a real W.M.D. or, like, a fake Saddam one?
no, a real one.
that sounds bad.
go now, before she finds you.
but- - There's no time to argue,
go no-o-o-o-ow!
[Man ] This message will self-destruct in one second,
wait- What?
[ Willy ] Come out, come out, wherever you are, - Lucy? - [ Willy ] Who wants to play with Willy?
Lucy, move over. I need someplace to hide.
Lucy. Lu- [ Spitting ]
who lives here? Liberace?
Aah!
this is a really big wardrobe.
what a MILF.
[ fades ] - Kneel before the queen!
you're a son of Adam.
a what? No, I'm Edward.
I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I
I was following Lucy into the wardrobe and- - Lucy?
how many are in your family? - No.
Lucy, Peter and Susan are not my family.
we're all just a bunch of orphans.
[ gasps ] - The prophecy!
[ screaming ] - Please.
let me help you up.
Wow.
Oh, you must be parched. - Yes.
whoa,
Wow. A 40?
Ah. - Drink.
fresh dog piss. Go ahead.
Yeah! [ Laughs ]
I love this place.
and this can all be your new home.
with my help, you can be king.
Wha-What? King? - [ Screams, Grunts ]
he can't be king- Oww!
and you would be my queen?
[ mutters ] I've never had a girlfriend before.
Oh!
[ pop ] - Ah!
how about that?
Oh, but first I must meet the others.
Why? You're not gonna make Peterking too, are you?
Oh! No.
but every king needs subjects to boss around.
but, Your Majesty
behold, my white castle.
[Edward] White Castle?
I feel like I've been there before.
bring me the others, and I'll crown you king.
[ chuckling ] Yes!
Lucy?
Edward!
you went through the wardrobe too.
[Peter] Lucy! - [Susan ] Lucy!
Edward! - Edward?
this is quite a hiding place.
we have to go now. We're in grave danger.
Oh, no, no. We should stay right here. What's the hurry, Lucy?
I mean, they just got here.
Hey, look! I'm spelling my name!
Mm-mmm. - Please!
we have to go. Mr. Tumnus told me.
Mr. Tumnus? Who the bloody hell's that?
I love Sudoku!
he's a goat-man...
and he warned of great peril!
Oh, Lucy. - Fine!
if you think I'm lying, just go ask him yourself!
Hmph.
this is gonna be harder than I thought.
Hey, look! Nicole Richie!
[Susan ] Mm-mmm,
Mr. Tumnus?
shit. I know what happened.
what the hell is that thing? - It's a talking beaver!
holy shit! - Get it outta here!
No! [ Screaming ] Motherfuck
something in my groin tells me you're not used to a talking beaver,
my name is Harry Beaver.
Mr. Tumnus is my life partner.
Mmm, Sweet man,
Mr. Tumnus was taken by the White Bitch.
she's hot- I mean, never heard of her.
the evil ruler. She arrested Mr. Tumnus for hiding a human.
is there anything we can do to help?
uh, yes. You must go to Aslo.
he's waiting for you at the Ancient Table.
who's Aslo? - Who's Aslo?
he's the true king of Gnarnia.
[ mutters ] Not for long. - Hello? The prophecy?
the four of you will join Aslo and lead the resistance to destroy the White Bitch.
us? - Yes, You're all heroes,
especially you, Peter.
[ man ] My son, I have sent you to Earth for a reason,
you will be the savior of all mankind,
you are truly invincible,
Oh, my God! You shot me in the fucking eye! That really hurts!
why would you do that? That was so unnecessary! You bastard!
but I can't be. - [ Mock British Accent ] "But I can't be." Why him?
well, maybe not Superman, but a hero all the same.
it's your destiny.
do you think you were all brought together by chance?
look at the clues. They're all around you.
[ mutters ] Oh, that's nice.
we're all in the painting.
but what does it mean?
right.
it's a cryptix.
the curator taught me how to decipher these.
Upsy-daisy.
be careful.
well, what is it?
it's our birth certificates.
we all have the same last name and the same parents.
I don't get it. - You're all related!
brothers and sisters.
you're a family, for Christ sakes!
sorry. - Is it really true?
none of us ever had a real family before.
none of us ever had a real family before.
it's true, You're quadruplets, - But our parents- - Killed by the White Bitch.
then she separated the four of you so the prophecy would never be fulfilled,
Where's Edward?
Hey, honey, I 'm home.
Hey, buddy. Did you miss me?
Ohh!
Why? - Cause I ain't your buddy!
where are the others?
I thought we had something special.
I even got a tattoo with your name on it.
that looks more like 50 Cent's tattoo, you idiot,
shit! They did the wrong one.
I won't ask again. Where is the rest of your family?
I told you, they're not my family.
tell me where they are,
never.
Yeah, they went to Mr. Tumnus's house. - [ Laughing ]
Yes! Yes! You just got punk'd! Yes!

and now she has Edward.
we must rescue him-Get a hold of yourself, Lucy!
Holy-It's too dangerous,
if she catch you, you are as good as dead.
[Phone Ringing] - Um, that's me.
the resistance has found out...
that the White Bitch has completed her weapon of mass destruction...
and is going to launch it in 24 hours.
let's get the hell out ofhere!
aslo is the only one that can help now.
then take us to him.
What'd you do that for?
I forgot.
before you meet. Aslo, you must train.
only then you can defeat the White Bitch...
and save your brother.
I'll meet you at Aslo's. May the force be with you.
someone's coming. The bitch is on to you. You must go now.
there you will train. - [Silas Continues Shrieking]

if you want them, you'll have to go through me first.
[ groans ] Please! Help!
he needs our help! - [ Groans ]
help! - No, Susan, Lucy.
he... wants us to go on.
he sacrificed himself for us.
Peter, if you can hear me, come back now!
I definitely underestimated the situation,
I'm in a lot of pain!
what should we do?
uh, we can't go back. We have to
we have to do what's best for Edward and for Gnarnia. - Screw Gnarnia!
he's testing us. - [ Gunshot ]

not!
[ bleeps ] you.
so now you all seen my crib.
so get the hell out- Oh!
the exam will only cover the stuff up to basically the last problem set
there are a few things about overlapping generations I might say today, which will clarify what you already know, but you don't have to know anything beyond the problem you turned in on Thursday
you're turning in today
so you I think you are better informed now than you were yesterday
I think it's a big help to be doing the problems so for those of you watching on screen at home do the problems
so remember we had a situation where there were generations each of whom was rich when young and poor when old that looked like that
and it went on forever
that was the only difference from what we've had before
people's lives were shorter than the lifetime of the economy, and to go to the extreme the economy goes on forever, even though people only live two periods.
and then there was land, 1, 1, 1, 1
there's land, and then there's generation because I forgot the generation--here's generation 0
generation 1, generation 2, generation 3...
and time. This is time
and here's time 1, time 2, time 3, time 4, time 5, etc
now this model, I've been told is the hardest thing you do the entire class
things are going to get much more complicated but since they build up slowly, I think this model's the hardest thing you have to do the entire class
I realize it's a little bit confusing, but in the end
I don't think it's that complicated
and it reveals all the subtlety of Fisher's thinking not that Fisher understood about overlapping generations but his ideas, you can see here.
so what are his ideas?
you've got a complicated model in which you've got people trading apples when they're young, against land
so the objects in the economy are land, which you're supposed to think of as the stock market, okay, so we've got land and we've got apples
now what's interesting is, the land is going to constantly change hands
so the young here are going to buy the land but when they get old, they're going to sell the land.
so the land is constantly changing hands.
it's not that one person buys it at the beginning and holds it forever.
so Fisher's formula, remember, was that the price of any asset was going to be equal to the discounted dividends.
and the logic seemed to be at the time that the price you know, if the person was going to buy the asset that they could take the money now or they could wait and get all the dividends in the future, and they would compare what they would get out of the dividends in the future to what they have to give up today.
but you see, in this example it's a little more complicated.
nobody's going to hold the land and get all the dividends.
each person who buys the land knows that he's going to sell it long before getting all the dividends from that land.
and yet the price of the land is still given by this formula so we never use the fact, in Fisher's argument that the same person had to hold the asset till the end.
and so now we have a case, an extreme case where people only hold the asset for one period.
it's always turning over, turning over turning over but still the price of the asset is equal to the discounted dividends.
so the secret to solving this problem, according to Fisher is forget about the asset.
that makes it too complicated.
Fisher's argument again is, take financial equilibrium
maybe I should write it on a different board
Fisher's argument is, financial equilibrium equilibrium, okay. Get rid of assets.
put dividends into endowments, and transform it into general equilibrium, the very thing you saw within the first couple days of class, okay, and then go backwards and figure out what the financial equilibrium is.
so although it seemed very easy before, it's a little subtler this time, but it's the same principle.
whose endowment should you put the dividends into?
the land is changing hands all the time.
there's a new guy owning it, a new guy owning it every period so whose endowments do we increase when we put the dividends of the land into someone's endowment?
you put it into the endowment of the guy who owned it first.
so put dividends into endowments of original owners okay?
so this old person who has the right to the first apple his own endowment of an apple, and also the right to the first dividend but he actually has a right to all the dividends.
so his endowment, the endowment of Mr. 0
is going to be 2, 1, 1, 1, etc.
because he has his original apple, plus he's got--he has his endowment of an apple, because everyone when they're old has an apple.
he's also, because he's owned the land before gotten the right to this first dividend of the apple that's 2, and because he's the original owner of land he owns all the future dividend streams of the land.
so we can forget about land after we've stuck the dividends into the right person's endowment, and now we just trade as if it's general equilibrium.
we just look for supply and demand and the present value prices which are p_1, p_2, p_3, etc. okay?
and because it's symmetric, we know that this is going to equal 1--p--we can always make one of them be--one price can be 1
so the present value prices are going to look like this.
the reason I can make this simplification is by symmetry.
every generation is the same, so it's obvious that I'll be able to keep repeating the same argument over and over again.
okay, and so what do I have--so remember, the land has disappeared here.
even though this generation is buying the land and selling the land in Fisher's story, you don't have to pay attention to that.
this guy bought the land, and then he sold the land so it was a fair trade.
so he started without it and ended without it.
the fact that in between he used the land to save you can already do that in a general equilibrium.
you don't need to think about the land because the only reason this guy is buying the land is to use it for a means of saving, which is already in Fisher's equation.
so to solve for equilibrium is then quite simple.
we just, in every generation, we look at
remember, I forgot to write the utility functions so we have U of consumption when young and old is 1 half log young [consumption]+1 half log old [consumption].
okay, and so therefore, in equilibrium we have to have that 1 half times the income of every generation every generation's going to have 3 when young 1 when old.
now from the point of view of any generation t the prices are p, say, p_2 when young and p_3 when old.
now remember, any generation cares only about relative prices.
so I can call them p_2 or p_3
or I can call them 1 and p, because the ratio's going to be p.
so, much simpler to think of the prices as 1 and p.
so the old guy, if I'm doing any t like this period 4, the old guy here you know, that's p_4 and p_3.
he cares about p_3 and p_4.
but he only cares about the ratio of p_3 and p_4 which is p.
so from his point of view, he might as well have thought of them as 1 and p.
so his income is 3+1p, and he's going to spend half his income on that good, which for him is a relative price of p.
the young guy is going to spend half his income which is also 3+1p.
this is the relative price between t - 1 and t.
this is the relative price between t and t+1.
but he's now young, so his price when young is 1
and that has to = 3+1+1 =--so I wrote it as 1+3+1 = 5, okay?
and we solved that, and we found that p = 0. 55.
so are there any questions about how we did that?
that's where we ended the last lecture.
is that clear to everyone? Yes.
Prof: Okay.
if I didn't have symmetry, I would have to say this is
I would have to write this--in general this would be 3p_t-1 1p_t over p_t and this guy would be 3p_t+1 p_t+1 divided by p_t. Right?
that would be, in general, if I had prices the present value prices, this guy's income would be given by that, because he's the old at time t and the young would be given by that okay?
and I'd have to do this, a new equation for every t.
who asked? You asked the question, so does that make sense?
student: Yes.
Prof: Okay, but I have to do that for every single t, so I have an infinite number of prices and an infinite number of equations.
but then you say to yourself, "Well, hmm if I take the ratio of p_t over p_t-1, to = p, then the ratio of these two prices is the same as this price, " and so I'll have one equation and one unknown variable and that same equation will get repeated every other generation.
because when I go to generation s, which is another generation all that matters is the ratio between p_t-1 and p_t and p_t and p_t+1.
so if I assume those ratios are always the same
I'm going to be repeating the same equation over and over again.
so if I can solve it once, I can solve it an infinite number of times.
it's basically the same equation written infinitely often and so as long as I stick in keep these ratios constant, I'm just doing it over and over again so I only have to do it once.
so it doesn't have to work out that it's--it's just because every generation has the same endowments and every generation has the same utility.
that's why it's such a simple thing to solve. Yeah?
Prof: The p, this p, is just the ratio between--this is how I got p.
p_t--okay, p is p_t over p_t-1
which also = p_t+1 over p_t.
the ratio of all the prices is always p.
the ratio between time t and time t+1, this good is more valuable than that good.
this good is only worth p. p is . 55.
it's only worth 55 percent of this good.
and then this good here is only worth 55 percent of that good.
so the symmetry assumption, the symmetry of the problem suggests that I could guess that the prices are
the present value prices are going to decline by the same percentage every period.
okay, any other questions?
we'll keep going with questions. Yes?
student: Could you explain the e... = 2, 1, 1, 1?
Prof: Yeah, what is the endowment of the original old guy?
he's the guy who owns the land.
so what does he have?
he has one apple, his endowment when he's old like everybody else who's old.
he has an apple, his own tree in his back yard gives him an apple when he's old or when he's an old man or an old woman he can barely scrape together one apple.
now he also has the land.
the land is his for all time, so the land is paying an apple every year forever.
so his own apple, at time 1, plus the land's apples is this 2, and the land produces an apple every time in the future.
so that's his endowment.
I stuck the dividends of the land into his endowment.
Prof: Right, I'm not assuming he lives forever. He doesn't.
in fact, he knows he's going to die in period 1.
he wants to do all his consuming in period 1
but he hasn't--that's another subtle thing about this.
you can own endowments that occur after you're dead.
if you own a tree, the tree, the land is going to be producing stuff long after you're dead so when you sell off the land, you're selling off those future dividends.
of course, you're not going to hold the land.
if you don't care about your children you're not going to hold the land beyond the time you live because you want to just consume as much as you can.
so you're going to sell off the land and consume but you're selling off all these future dividends, okay?
so another thing this model gives us is a new argument for the real interest rate, real r, being greater than 0.
so why is it?
because from this formula--gosh I was so clever.
where did I--oh, here.
from the price of the asset, this discounted dividends that's going to be 1 over , 1 over squared +1 over cubed, ..., by the way that's = to p+p squared+p cubed, you notice, okay?
so the discounted value of the dividends is the price of land.
so the price of land, of course, has to be finite because if the old guy owned a thing worth an infinite amount of money he'd sell it and he'd buy everything in the world.
so if you're going to have equilibrium, there's no plot of land that sells for 10, for 100 trillion dollars.
the price of every plot of land is some finite amount.
so if the land is producing, I think it's sort of realistic.
land is probably going to produce forever.
as long as the world lasts, if you've got land you'll get something out of it.
someone will always want the land, and so if it's going to have a finite price, the whole future dividends have to be discounted to a finite number.
if you put 0 in here for r, you get infinity.
so this presence of land is forcing the discount rate above 0.
so it's another argument that Fisher never would have thought of because he never thought about infinities or anything like that
another argument for the real interest rate being positive.
okay, any other questions about this?
so we reduce it to one equation, and I'll put back the p here in just one unknown.
okay, = 5. And we saw that we get p = . 55.
and it's a quadratic equation, so you can all solve quadratic equations.
okay, what else do I want to say?
so now you could analyze all sorts of things.
you could do the same comparative statics Fisher does.
suppose we change the utility function and made this 1 third instead of 1 half.
that would correspond to doing what?
making people more?
more what?
impatient, okay.
and what would you think would happen to the interest rate?
student: Go up.
Prof: Go up, okay.
so in the Excel file, we're going to do just that.
we're going to see it's going to go up.
instead, we could do the Social Security thing and we could have every young person give something to the previous old, which means everybody's endowment goes from say 3 to 2 and 1 to 2
so they get more in the future and less early on.
so again, you could re-solve for equilibrium and Fisher'ssaying, if you've got more endowment in the future and less in the present you're going to have a higher real interest rate.
so you get a higher real interest rate.
you could make the land more productive and change this to a 2 everywhere, and see what happened.
so in this Excel file, I do that.
maybe I'll come back to that.
so we're going to do those experiments in a second but now I want to do two more things before I end this.
the first is, I want to say suppose we had growth in the economy.
so what if you had growth?
where am I going to add growth?
over here. I shouldn't have erased that.
so let's have growth.
what happens?
well, Tobin, you know, Yale's greatest economist after Irving Fisher, he said something which was 90
percent right but not 100 percent right.
he said, you know, I pointed out to him that I got these guys at Social Security.
I worked with them.
anyway, these people at Social Security and the Social Security
administration calculated who were the biggest beneficiaries of Social Security, and it was Tobin's generation the same generation as my father.
and I said, "Look, it's your fault that Social Security is such a mess.
you benefited and I'm going to have to pay for it.
and just like you're feeling you're going to have to pay for it so it's even worse for you.
but even my generation's not getting a very good deal.
yours is getting a terrible deal, Tobin's got a great deal.
and so he said to me, it's not his fault it's my fault, because I didn't have enough children.
so the question is, what happens if you--what does that mean?
so what Tobin meant is that if, instead of having 1 child for every adult--so every family has 2 children in other words, instead of 1 child for every adult, so it goes 3, 1
3, 1, 3, 1, we start doubling--the generations are growing through time.
so since this is 30 years or something, we could think of the generations doubling.
that wouldn't be such a fast growth rate.
and so Tobin might have meant, if you double the generations you're going to have 6 and 2 as the endowment.
2 guys at 3 and 1, which means 6 and 2.
then you're going to have 12 and 4.
it's going to be a gigantic growth and so each generation, when it's old the young guys, if there's 6 and 2 here now
I should use a different color.
if I wrote 6 and 2 here, then each guy would have to
or 2 guys at 3 and 1, each guy would only have to give up half a unit, because there'd be 2 of them each giving half a unit to the old guy.
and each one, when he gets old getting a full unit.
so this guy would get a full unit.
the next generation would only give up half a unit and because there were 4 times as many people in the next generation each of them would still give 1 half making these 2 old guys get their full 1.
and when they got old, they'd similarly get a full 1 each of them.
so it would seem that if you had a faster growing population then Social Security would be a much better deal because the young would have to give up less to the old and still get fully paid back when they were old and so Social Security wouldn't have been a problem.
OK, so why wasn't it our fault, my fault--and your generation is probably not going to have any more children than my generation.
is that true, Tobin's argument?
is it true that if we just had enough children no one would have to lose out in Social Security?
we could make the original generation better off and also every other generation after that better off? Yeah?
Prof: Right, exactly.
and so you can't know that until you actually solve the model.
so the point is, that if the generations keep growing like that, the interest rate is going to go up and so it's still going to be a loss, because although you're going to be trading off - 1 half to get 1
as opposed to - 1 to get 1--so this looks like a much better scenario.
once you get to this scenario, there's going to be a bigger interest rate.
so remember, the present value of that trade is - 1 (1 over (1+r)).
that's why it's negative, because r is positive.
here it's - 1 half (1 over (1+r)), but that's a different r.
that's an r, I'll put it at the top that's in a new economy, a growing economy and that r is going to be a bigger r.
so even though it's - 1 half instead of 1
this thing's going to be small enough, so you still end up losing money.
but you'd never know that unless you solved it.
and in fact, it's still going to depend on a little delicate assumption.
so Tobin, by the way, never bothered to work this out.
I claim that if you're going to be doubling the population like this there are going to be a lot more people working on the land, and so the dividends of the land are probably going to grow at the same rate.
so I would add a 2 here.
I'd make the dividends of the land also double if the population doubled.
so the land dividends are going to grow.
now you can see why the interest rate has to go up because the present value of the land still has to be a finite number, the present discounted value of the dividends.
and if the dividends are growing, then the interest rate had better be growing even faster if you're going to make that a finite number.
so sure enough, when you solve it you're going to get a higher interest rate.
so how would you solve it?
let's say the growth rate is g, so every generation is 1+g times bigger the previous generation.
so you could just change this equation very simply.
what would you do?
well, for any generation, it's the same equation except that you've got 1+g times as many old guys as you have --these are young guys.
the number of young guys is 1+g times the number of old guys.
so if it's generation t, time t, this would be to the , and this would get multiplied by to the t.
and the dividend, 5, so everybody's endowment is also going up, so it would be--actually I screwed up.
it would be, the old guy's 1 times to the the young guys times to the t the dividend times to the t, or t - 1, whichever.
okay, so that's the new equation.
you can divide through by to the .
so this is period t's market clearing equation but you can see I haven't--because the number of old guys, for each one of them that's behaving like that, but there are now this many of them and the young guys are behaving just as before, but there are this many of them, more of them.
and then the endowments of the old have been grown that far you know, the old generation has this many endowments.
the young has this much endowments when young and then the land we also assumed grew.
okay, so now you can just divide through by to the , and that goes away and that just leaves that, and that goes away and that goes away, and that goes away.
so you'd have that equation.
student: Can you do that again?
Prof: Oh no, yes.
I was afraid someone was going to do that.
so let's just see where I got this equation from.
so I took my original equation, which didn't have any 1+gs in it and I just said if I had growth in the economy, it's no big deal to take that into account.
I'm still going to have 1 equation, so I can still solve it.
it's just that at every time t, how many old guys do I have?
I have each old guy behaving the same way as before except that now there's been a growth of 1+g.
this is a generation before this one, so this generation is of size to the .
the young generation, which was 1 generation ahead has grown by a factor of 1+g.
so there's to the t of these guys.
so I take their old demand, you know the same for each guy, but different number of guys and the young generation's demand, and I have to set it = to the supply.
but that's just the old guy's endowment so 1 for each old guy, and there are that many old guys the young guys' endowment same as before, and there are that many of them the land, which I've also assumed has been doubling, 1+g is 2.
so the land is also doubling.
and I'm not sure whether I called this t or t - 1
but either one, it's not going to make a big difference, okay?
who asked the question? You follow that, right?
I've got 1+gs everywhere, so I can cancel a lot of them out.
that's all I did.
so if I divide by to the
I just get rid of the to the s.
I change to the t divided by to the .
that's just to the first power.
I got rid of this one.
I made this to the first power, and this to the first power okay?
so I can solve that perfectly easily and I'll do that in Excel in a second.
and then we can see what happens to everybody's utility.
so any questions about what I did here?
Yes.
Prof: Yeah, it's going to change the answer but it's going to qualitatively be the same.
Prof: Well, it depends whether when I do this I want to say this is 2, 4,8, 16 or whether I want to call it 1, 2,4, 8,16.
so I don't know which is the right thing.
probably I should have done 1, 2, 4, 8.
probably the way I have it here which is t - 1.
okay, any other questions about this?
so the last thing to do is to just do it numerically because it's a pain to have to solve these, you know these quadratic things.
it's only 1 equation, but it's still a pain to solve and I happen to have written a file that you can use to solve these all automatically.
this doesn't look too good.
so the first one, the first case I did suppose A, that's the exponent for how patient you are.
that's half, that's the first exponent half, half.
so I always can make the log utilities, the 2 coefficients so it's A log B.
so I'm assuming utility here, U of young and old is A log young + log old, old consumption okay?
so A I took to be 1 half.
that's just what we were figuring out.
I took the endowments when young to be 3 and when old to be 1
and the land output to be 1 forever.
then the price is what I'm going to try and solve for and so I solved the market clearing equation and cleared it and did Excel solver and got the consumption which we figured out was 1. 775 when young and when old was 3. 225, which adds up the two of them add up to 5 together just as we thought.
and so I even calculated the utility of each of the people.
I didn't do log utility, actually, I wrote a monotonic transformation.
I put Y to the A, Z to the .
it's easier for me, you get positive numbers.
that's e to the U.
so I might as well describe utility as the exponent of U.
take e to it, so it's a positive number.
when you do logs of small numbers, you get negatives so that's easier to look at.
so that's the utility.
okay, now we can do Social Security.
what happens with Social Security?
the only effect of Social Security, remember, it's the same model.
you just take stuff away from the young and give it to the old.
so nothing changes, except the young's endowment goes down to 2 and the old's endowment goes up to 2.
and then the rest of the model's exactly the same.
and so, of course, it's going to give you a different price.
pa is different. So pa is smaller.
that means today's price of next year's good is smaller.
there must be more discounting.
so I did the interest rate, 1 over 1+r = p so the inverse of p is this thing.
so the forward rate is 161 percent, and if you think of that as 30 years, that's an annualized 3. 2 percent interest rate.
before, it was only a 2 percent interest rate annualized, right?
remember we got the 1+r to be 181 percent, 1. 81
so r is 81 percent.
so this Social Security doubled the interest rate from 81 percent to 161 percent.
huge increase in the interest rate, so Social Security has raised the interest rate.
and so you re-solve the whole equilibrium and it didn't crush everybody but everybody's utility went down except for the very first generation.
we know they won for free.
but now I could do the same thing with growth.
I could just solve that equation on the left and so I plug in now the growth rate from generation to generation 1+growth, and here I've got 2.
so it doubles every period, just the example I did and so I solve it and you see that of course from the generations growing and land is being more productive and there are more apples and stuff like that there's just more for everybody to consume.
it's actually made everybody better off.
but now we see that Tobin and the interest rate is higher way higher, 247 percent instead of 161 percent.
if I do now Social Security in the growing economy every generation when young only has to give up half an apple and get 1 whole apple when old so that raises the interest rate from 247 percent to 300 percent annualized from 4 percent to 4. 7 percent.
so the rate of growth is faster now than the growth of the economy, right?
this interest rate, 300 percent is faster than the rate of growth, which is 100 percent.
so again, everybody is going to lose.
they're going to go from 3. 06--they're still going to lose by Social Security, to go down to 3.
but Tobin, I would say, is 90 percent right although more children doesn't solve the Social Security problem because it's going to increase the rate of interest.
so you're still going to have losers.
nonetheless, the loss is now much smaller with lots of children than it was before.
so Tobin, I would say, is 90 percent right.
if only every generation would have more children we still would have had a crisis in Social Security.
we still would have had this every generation complaining it was getting a bad deal, but it would be a lot less bad than it was before.
and then I did this variant, depending on what we said whether the growth was--whether I had a g to the t or a g to the there.
it doesn't really change that much.
okay, so that's it.
so you see, just by a very simple modification of the problem you can resolve--it's just understanding is so much, at least in my mind so much clearer now about what role growth plays.
having more children doesn't make the problem go away.
it makes it better, but you can never make it go away because the interest rate is always going to be higher than the rate of growth of the economy.
so let's do one last experiment on this stuff.
another problem to resolve.
I wrote a paper, the newspapers were saying the same sorts of things and I'll tell you what they were saying.
Oh no, I did a mistake. Sorry.
okay, so remember those pictures that we showed before of the stock market.
if you take out inflation, the stock market seems to go in these waves where prices go up and then they come down then prices go up, then they come down and prices go up, then they come down.
we've had 5 big waves of stock markets going up and coming down.
we're now in a period where they've been coming down.
the stock market is lower now than it was 10 years ago correcting for inflation.
in fact, even not correcting for inflation.
so why would you expect that to happen?
is there any logic to that?
so here's an old picture of the stock market.
I wrote this paper in 2005.
remember at the first class, we had a picture like that.
you can see the stock market going up and down up and down, up and down up and down, five waves.
it's now come down further.
this is like 2001 or '02, so it's come down way further than that.
so is there any explanation for why that would happen?
so here's an explanation I gave in a paper, which a lot of people in the newspapers were giving.
I said, the baby boomers.
I said all these baby boomers like me, we're getting old.
we're going to start selling our stocks and so the stock market's going to go down.
and so that's what newspapers were saying too.
the difference is, that the economists criticized the newspapers and me and they say, "Oh you're crazy, " they said.
the stock market, it can't be that the stock market is going to go down, and everybody knows it's going to go down, because if we knew it was going to go down in the future, it would have already gone down now.
okay, so you have to give an argument.
so what I pointed out was that if you look at the history of live births, you get the same cycle.
look, it went up and down, up and down.
I don't know if you can read that.
I can hardly read it myself.
what years are these?
why is it so unreadable?
let's just see if I blow it up a little bit.
now I can see it.
this is 1910, '20, '30, '40 '50, '60, '70, '80, '90, 2000.
you can see these were live births.
so births, there a baby boom and then a plummet then another huge baby boom.
that's the famous baby boom, my baby boom and then a plummet.
and then there was another baby boom.
I forget what they call it, the X generation or whatever it is some other baby boom that happened.
basically my baby boomers, me having children another big baby boom and then birth rates are going to go down.
so I think that you are--the number of 18 year olds in the country is at its all time high, or is going to be in two years when my poor son tries to get into college.
and so then it's going to go down again.
so this is a cyclical thing that keeps happening over and over again with baby booms and busts.
and everybody knows about the baby boom after the war my generation, the '50s and '60s when I was born.
everybody knows about that, but they don't realize that there's been baby boom after baby boom after baby boom and this is a cyclical phenomenon.
and then the thing that they really don't know is that it's exactly the same as the stock market that those 5 patterns in the stock market were the same patterns of the baby boom.
okay, so I'm going to end with that picture.
okay, so a picture is worth a thousand words but it's not that compelling an argument. You need a little bit of analytics.
suppose everybody knew that generations were going to get bigger and then smaller and then bigger and then smaller.
would the stock market go up and then down and then up and then down, as I was saying, and as all these newspaper columnists were saying?
or would it just stay the same, as these less imaginative economist critiquers were saying, that it couldn't have anything to do with demography?
because by rationality, people would look forward and they'd anticipate it going down, so they'd all sell before it went down, so it would never go down.
so it turns out that it does go up and down and that argument the economists gave doesn't make any sense because they were implicitly assuming that the rate of interest stayed the same the whole time.
and if the rate of interest doesn't stay the same then there's no reason why the stock market has to stay the same.
so let's go back to where we were before and change the model a little bit.
let's suppose that the model is an alternation between big generations and small generations.
so let's suppose that you have , and .
I think I kept--so it's a good question.
what should I do with land?
I think I kept it at 1 every period.
God, I hope that wasn't the key to the result.
so in the paper, of course, I had you know, people living 80 years and I had their income reflecting the sort of trend in income over the lifetime.
but anyway, for the purposes of this class, let's say there's a small generation where it goes young 3, old 1.
then the next generation, which is just 2 guys so they're both guys, so in aggregate they're going to be .
the next generation's , the next generation's the next generation's and it keeps alternating like that forever.
now, how would you solve for equilibrium?
does the whole thing just get much more complicated?
I mean, what happens, after all?
any questions here about what we're doing?
so it looks way more complicated, but it's not.
it's a little bit more complicated, but not much.
you can still solve for this.
so I'm going to not spend too much time on this but I'm just going to show you what you would do.
so what would you do?
well, by symmetry, I claim, you can guess that there are going to be two prices.
so you notice that every generation only cares about the relative price when it's young and when it's old.
so there's this relative price.
that relative price between consumption at time 1 and time 2
that's going to affect the generation born at time 1.
it actually has no effect on any other generation.
these generations are born after that, so this interest rate this relative price between these two periods affects only 1 generation.
so this generation is affected by the interest rate between time 2 and time 3.
this generation is affected by the interest rate at time 3 and time 4.
every generation is responding to the interest rates during its life not during another generation's life.
so by symmetry, I think, you can guess
and it turns out to be true--that there's going to be a price a relative price--I should call them small--for the small generation and a relative price for the big generation.
the same thing is going to happen.
so this relative price will be Psmall this will be Pbig.
then we'll get Psmall again here and Pbig connecting these guys.
and it's just going to keep repeating itself over and over again.
and by symmetry, you could guess that the equilibrium would look like that.
is this making sense? It's not making sense.
is it making sense?
so what would I have to check to see that there's equilibrium?
let's do it over here.
let's do a small generation.
okay, so we never did the first.
so the first generation, it depends whether we start with a small one or a big one.
but remember, if we can clear all the markets for all time, except the first market that one has to automatically clear.
that was Walras' insight.
so we know that if we can clear all these the first one's going to look very different but it's going to clear anyway, so I don't really have to worry about it.
so we'll see why that works.
so I'm going to now talk about market clearing at any time except the first one, which is more complicated.
the first one seems really complicated because there's this guy 0 who owns these dividends that go on forever.
but of course, they're just worth the price of land which he's going to sell off.
but anyway, we'll come back to that in a second.
so in every generation, every time period when small generation is young, what do you get?
what's the market clearing equation going to be?
well, the small generation is going to be young so that means the old generation is big.
sorry, it's a half here, so the big old guys their endowment is going to be 6.
there's 2 of them, so I can put the 2 out here.
that's the big old generation and the young generation they're the usual 3 1 Psmall divided by 1.
a has to = now, how many endowments do we have?
we've got 2 old guys each owning 1, so that's 2 times 1.
that's their endowment, +3, that's the young guys the land dividend. So that's 6.
Prof: So this should be Psmall not Psmall. Psmall.
no, I don't, because the old guys--the big generation is old.
the small generation is young.
so the young generation, they're consuming in their youth now, so they're looking at their endowment.
the price when they're young is 1.
so their young endowment is 3, their old endowment
their income's 3 times the price to them of 1 when they're young plus the endowment of 1 when they're old times Psmall divided by the price when they're young which they're thinking of as 1, right?
they only care about the relative price between young and old.
that relative price is determined by Psmall.
so I could call it p_t and p_t1
but I know that ratio is going to be Psmall.
so really, it only depends on the ratio, so I might as well just use the ratio, Psmall.
this is a crucial idea that I've used 100 times and
I think--I've used it now 3 or 4 times anyway--so, but I think some of you don't quite know what the hell I'm talking about.
so somebody ask me a question if they don't know why this is right.
whoever just asked it, maybe you still don't know why it's right.
who asked this question a minute ago?
Yes. Do you understand how I got this? You do.
okay, but when the old guys--see, the old guys which is the big generation, we're clearing time--we're looking at this time.
so the total endowment is 3 for the young generation.
their endowment is 2, and the 1 unit of land.
that's where I got the total supply of 6.
so this generation when it's young they care about the Psmall the relative price between here and here and so they're looking at Psmall, the relative price of 1 to Psmall.
the old generation at the same time is looking over their lifetime at the ratio of consumption here to here which is given by Pbig.
so they've got a Pbig here and they're consuming when old, so they're dividing by Pbig, okay?
but now we've got a second equation, which is when the big generation is young.
so why don't you tell me what that equation's going to be?
how much is the endowment when the big generation is young?
that's, maybe, clearing it this time.
here the big generation is young, so what's the endowment?
it's going to be the young--so the old, there's only going to be 1 old guy.
there are going to be 2 young guys, each have endowment of 3
1 unit of land, so that's 8.
you can see that adds up to 6+1+1 is 8.
okay, and what's their demand?
what's the demand for the 2--so there's the old.
what are the old going to be doing here?
it's in this generation we're doing the market clearing.
somebody knows how to answer this. Yeah.
Prof: Over here, the young the small generation only has 1 when it's old.
student: Big generation.
Prof: But big generation that's over here.
we're clearing at this time period, so there's a bunch of young guys and just a few old guys.
so the endowments are 6+1+1.
the time is going that way, so that's why that's an 8 over here.
so if this is the 1 old guy's endowment, 2 young guys who have 3 each, that's endowment of 6, the land is 1 so you get 8.
that's how I got an 8 over there. That's the supply.
so what's the demand? Who's trying to buy the stuff?
what's the demand of the old guys?
Prof: And that's going to be what?
they're planning to spend when they're old.
we're doing this one.
they make their plans when they're young.
they anticipate what the prices are going to be and so how much do they plan to spend when they're old?
student: 1 half times 3+1p
Prof: 3+1p what? p what? What p?
student: Psmall.
Prof: Psmall, exactly. Over Psmall, plus
Prof: What are the young guys doing?
we're over here. So 2.
there are 2 of them.
what's this? p what?
divided by?
Oh, there's 1 half here.
Prof: 1. Okay, exactly. So that's it.
so there are 2 equations and 2 unknowns, Pbig and
Psmall, and 2 equations.
so to solve this whole model, you could get 2 equations you just have to solve these two simultaneous equations which I did.
and then you can find the effect.
so the economist critiquers would say, "Well, Pbig should equal
what would be the price of land, by the way?
so what's the price of land going to be in the end?
what's going to be the price of land, according to Fisher at time 1?
at time 1, let's say.
so right here, what's the price of land?
remember, it's the price after the dividend is paid so what's the price of land?
Prof: Let's do the present value of the discounted dividends.
what would it be?
maybe I'd better write it over here.
remember, the dividends are just 1+1--you know, 1
so there's going to be 1+1+1+1, but I'm going to be multiplying by something.
so what is the price of land?
Psmall, incidentally, =
I could always write that as 1 over 1 rsmall and I could write Pbig as 1 over 1 rbig.
okay, so what's the price of land going to be?
so it's the price of land starting here just after the dividend is paid.
so it's hard to think about this, but if you can figure this out then you've totally understood everything in the course, because this is so much more it uses all the ideas in a just way more complicated way.
yes?
Prof: Well, start telling me the formula.
so if I want--when I do the first terms, what is this first term?
Prof: So you would put 1+rsmall here?
okay, and now what would you put over here?
student: 1+rbig.
Prof: You'd put 1+rbig here?
Prof: Okay, very good.
so now you guys really know what's going on.
what would you put over here?
Prof: Okay, exactly.
1+rsmall time 1+rbig, times 1+rsmall.
okay, that's that one.
I'm going to stop with that. Too much. dot, dot, dot.
so you have the idea now. What's the idea?
you're taking the present value of all the dividends.
so this dividend, you have to discount it by 1+rsmall.
this one, you have to discount it twice.
first to bring it back here, that's 1 rbig then to bring it back here, that's another 1 rsmall.
so 1+rbig, 1+rsmall.
the third dividend, you discount first at the small discount then at the big discount, then at the small discount, just like that.
you keep adding them.
so why should the prices--what if you look at the price of land at time 2?
is it the same number as that?
is it the same formula?
Prof: It's not the same formula, because at time 2
you're starting here, and the first discount is Pbig.
so it's going to be 1 over 1+rbig 1 over 1+ rbig times 1 rsmall 1 over 1
so this isn't the same as that.
it would only be the same as that if rbig was = to rsmall if Psmall was equal to Pbig.
so which one do you think is bigger?
do you think Psmall is = to Pbig or one of them is bigger than the other, and why?
that's the answer to the critics' puzzle.
so you see, you've taken something that appeared in the newspapers.
it sounds like common sense.
if there are all these middle-aged people like me bidding up--you know, there are so many of us who want to hold stocks.
we're at the peak of our earning power.
we've got tremendous amounts of money.
what are we going to do with it except put it into stocks.
you'd think common sense would be the price of stocks would have to go up.
when we get old and we're selling all our stocks you'd think the price of stocks would have to go down okay?
so that would tell you that the interest rate was going to be bigger or smaller.
so that would suggest that the price at time 1
when the small generation was young, would be low and the price at time 2 would be high.
and that could happen if this interest rate was low and this interest rate was high.
but does that happen or doesn't that happen?
you can't know until you solve in the model.
the critics said, "Oh, that can't be right because somehow the price should even out and everybody should be looking ahead and buying or selling at the right time.
you can't buy and sell at the right time, because you're going to be dead.
so you don't have much choice, except when you're young here to save, and when you're old here to dis-save.
they seem to have overlooked that small problem.
so the point is that, to know the answer you can't just reason it out verbally.
you have to write down a model, solve for the model and see what happens.
and sure enough, it happens--so we go back to the paper now.
okay, are there any questions about this?
okay, so all I did in this spreadsheet is I wrote down these 2 equations.
so you see that I've got the young and the old are the same half half log utilities.
the small generation is 3, 1, the big generation is 6, 2.
land is always producing 1 every period and we get 2 different prices.
the price is called pa.
that's the A generation, which is the small generation and the B generation, which is the big generation.
so you can see that pa is a very small number when the generation is small, and that means the discount rate is very high.
so a high interest rate when the generation is small and a low interest rate when the generations are big.
so in the money making peak of the big generation the real interest rate is small, and so that means you're not discounting very much, and so the prices are very high of land.
and so sure enough, the price when the small generation is young is 1. 29, and when the big generation is young it's 2. 08, vastly higher.
so it really is the case that as the generations rise and fall the interest rates rise and fall and the price of land rises and falls and everybody's rational, anticipating everything.
so it really could be--I'm not saying it's true because it could be a coincidence that these things all matched up, but the fact is demography can have a big effect on economic equilibrium in the stock market.
and you can be an economist and believe in demography.
you don't have to be a Marxist or something to think demography and fertility and all that stuff is going to affect the economy.
for a long time, economics tried to wall itself off from other social sciences and say "Oh, those fertility people and you know, all those touchy-feely people it's got nothing to do with the real markets.
well, it has a lot to do with the real markets.
okay, so one last thing, would you rather be in the small generation or the big generation?
Prof: Of course, the answer's there but tell me why.
yeah?
student: Small.
Prof: Okay, that's correct. So I'm screwed.
and so why is that?
Prof: It turned out to be the utility of the--this is the utility of the big generation per person.
of course, adding the two people together it's bigger, so per person it was this a lot less than the generation of the utility of the small.
so why did that happen?
why exactly is that happening?
so remember, I'm distinguishing your peak.
I'm calling young your peak earning years and old I'm calling the stuff when you're retired, I'm not earning very much.
so why is it that a high interest rate is good? Yes.
student: It encourages consumption today for the younger generation.
Prof: Well, I think the point is if you're making money when you're young and you've got a high interest rate that means a high return.
so you can make a big return through your life whereas my generation had a very low return.
the return I'm getting now is terrible. It's negative.
the return I'm getting now is just hideous.
but when my parents were young, they were making an astronomical return, incredible rates of return.
and they were earning money in their younger years and investing it to save when they were old and they were getting incredibly high return.
there was nothing to do with my money.
there are so many people like me pouring money into the stock market we're getting a very bad return and that's why it's not so good to be part of a big generation.
so other people had said the same thing.
they said big generations have to squeeze into the same houses so there's less housing stock, or we build more houses the next generation comes along, there are all these houses built for them and there are less of them so they get better houses.
everything's better when you're the small generation.
you're screwed as the big generation and here's an example of it.
okay, so that's it for Social Security.
all the things I wanted to say about Social Security.
now the exam, as I say, you won't have to do the two generations and all that stuff on the exam.
but the first part about solving for the . 55
that one you might have to do something like that.
but anyway, the lesson that you can have a controversy in the newspapers with arguments on both sides you never can figure out the right answer till you write down a model.
and the model can be very simple, the kind of thing you could do as an undergraduate.
that's the lesson I'm trying to communicate.
all right, so from now on though, we have to change gears and I think the course gets a lot more interesting okay.
but we needed all this background basics to have the logic of finance.
but finance is really nothing without uncertainty.
if you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow that's when the thing gets interesting that's when you have to think harder that's when people make mistakes, that's when a hedge fund can make a profit, that's when everything gets more exciting, when there's uncertainty and we have to start adding uncertainty to our thinking about the world.
so since I only have a few minutes
I'm going to spend the last few minutes just reminding you of what you're supposed to know about uncertainty which is this slide, okay?
so it's not a very complicated thing.
Where's the--I see PowerPoint.
okay so there are two kinds of uncertainty, one of which we're never going to get to.
so the uncertainty that we're going to work with in this course is everybody understands what could possibly happen.
so this was a brilliant states of the world model it's called.
so Leibniz is supposed--see, it says states of the world right there.
leibniz was the one who first invented the idea of states of the world.
he said, "We live in the best of all possible worlds.
so if you don't know what's going to happen in the future we're going to represent that as many potential states of the world.
now there are other ways you could model uncertainty and it's a big subject in epistemology and philosophy.
I'm going to stay--hew closely to the states of the world thing.
so if there's something about the world we don't know tomorrow, I'm not going to assume that it's just vague in our minds and we can't quite make it out.
I'm going to assume you actually can make it out.
it's just you don't know which of the possibilities are going to happen.
so it's many states of the world.
so an example of that, of course, is spinning a dice or spinning two dice, so you don't know which of 36
possibilities is going to happen.
each of those would be one state of the world.
okay, so those are all the possible sums so there are more states of the world than there are outcomes notice.
you can get 2 through 12, is the sum of the dice but there's still 36 possible states of the world.
and so that random variable, the sum of the two dice is expressed as a function.
it says, in every state of the world what is the random variable's value?
so our state of the world, by that I mean something that's so detailed that it tells you the value of every random variable.
so that's how I'm going to be thinking of uncertainty that we're here today and a bunch of different things could happen tomorrow, and this is an exhaustive list of everything that can happen tomorrow.
we're going to have to come back and criticize this assumption but it introduces uncertainty in a way which is still quantifiable and not vague.
so you can talk about the histograms of outcomes of the dice you know, how many ways what are the chances of getting a 7, 6 out of 36, etc.
so this is stuff I'm sure you all know, okay.
the most famous histogram of mathematics is the normal distribution which I don't have time to explain.
and so a normal distribution, remember, is this exponential thing.
the dice example, you know, sort of looks like it.
in fact, if you had enough dice, and you kept averaging their outcome, it would be normally distributed.
so lots of things turn out to be normal.
one of the properties of normal is that the tail gets small very quickly and so you're not going to get very many outliers.
the normal distribution is a very common distribution.
there're lots of reasons why it should occur all the time and it's also mathematically very easy to work with.
so economists for a long time assumed that everything was normally distributed, but an implication as I say, of normal distribution is that it's very unlikely something extreme is going to happen because this thing goes down exponentially fast to 0
so you're almost never going to see something way out here.
yet we get these crashes fairly frequently.
every 10, 20, 30 years or something there's some gigantic outlier.
so clearly things can't be normally distributed and that's called fat tails.
I'm sure you've heard about that in the newspaper.
we're going to come back to that.
now there are a couple of things that you need to
so you can represent the payoff of any random variable as a picture, and every state what is its payoff?
so a riskless random variable, riskless investment will pay the same amount in every state.
I still have a few minutes here.
okay, so now two incredibly important concepts which I'm sure you know--or at least the mean you know just the average, what's the expected payoff?
so the expected payoff is, you multiply the outcome in every state by the probability of the state and you add it up.
okay, so there are how many different ways?
so if you have 1 dice, you can figure out the expectation of 1 dice.
it's equally likely to get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6
and so if you add all those up, multiplied by a sixth you get 3 and 1 half.
so the expectation of 1 dice is 3 and 1 half.
the expectation of two dice is therefore--okay that's 1 dice.
okay, now the expectation of adding 2 dice together is of course going to be 7, because the expectation of 1
dice is 3 and 1 half and the other dice is 3 and 1 half and so the expectation of the sum is the sum of the expectation, so it's 7.
okay, so you know that.
now one more thing that you have to know is the variance.
so how do you measure how uncertain you are about what's going to happen?
well, the simplest number to do, like with the dice is to say, the expectation is 3 and 1 half.
when we don't get 3 and 1 half, it means there is some error.
expectation wasn't confirmed.
so you could just measure the error as the distance between 3
and 1 half and what you actually got.
so if you got a 4 you could say you were off by 1 half.
but people don't do that.
they measure the square of the distance and they take the average square of the distance, and that's called the variance.
so if you got 4 when you were expecting 3 and 1 half the error is 1 half squared, so you take 1 sixth times
that's for the high mistakes.
and the low mistakes, you'd take 1 sixth times 1 half squared
now why do they use the expected squared error instead of just the expected error?
well, for this simple reason, which you may not have thought of if you had to guess--if you looked at the error as the penalty for making a wrong guess and you were forced at the beginning to say "What guess would you like to make for how the dice is going to turn out--how the dice is going to turn out and if you're wrong, we'll penalize you by this measure of error?
well, if you were just taking the absolute error your best guess would be any number between 3 and 4.
you could say 3 and 1 half, but you could also say 3 and 1 quarter because if you said 3 and 1 quarter you'd become closer on all the low rolls of the dice, and be a little further off on all the high rolls, and you'd get exactly the same error.
so you could say any number between 3 and 4.
but if you make the error the square of the mistake your best guess is always to say the expectation.
3 and 1 half is the only thing you can say to minimize your expected penalty, if the penalty is the squared error.
so because of that--so that's connected to a mathematical thing and orthogonal vectors and all that.
because of that, the error we talk about always is the squared error.
and so that's whenever we're measuring uncertainty we're going to talk about the squared error the average of the squared errors--or the square root of that which is called the standard deviation.
okay, I've one more minute to just finish this.
I'm assuming you all know that or can learn that.
one more thing, I'm going to assume you know, the last thing is the covariance.
what does it mean to say that random variables X and Y move in the same direction?
so this was quite a brilliant thought.
so what it means is that to move in the same direction means if X surprises you by being above what you would have expected so if the expectation of X is X bar and the expectation of Y is Y bar if you multiply the 2 and they're both higher than you expected you'll get a positive number.
if they're both lower than expected, you'll also get a positive number.
so by taking this sum, the expected deviation from the expectation multiplied, you get a number which, when it's very positive it means they're either both positive together or both negative together.
so they're going in the same direction.
if one of them is above the average while the other one's below the average, then you'll get a negative number.
so big covariance means they move in the same direction.
big negative covariance means they move in the negative direction.
okay, so I'm going to take it for granted you know this and we're going to take this up, starting right after the exam which is on Tuesday.
so I'm going to cover this.
so we're ready to start.
so, so far we've considered is, the case of certainty.
so with uncertainty things get much more interesting and I want to remind you of a few of the basics of mathematical statistics that I'm sure you know.
so you know we deal with random variables which have uncertain outcomes but with well-defined probabilities.
so another step that we're not going to take in this course is to say people just have no idea what the chances are something's going to happen.
shiller thinks we live in a world like that where who knows what the future's going to be like and people they hear a story and then everybody gets wildly optimistic and then they hear some terrible story and then everybody gets wildly pessimistic and that kind of mood swing can affect the whole economy.
I'm not going to deal with that.
it's hard to quantify and I'm not exactly sure it's as important as he thinks it is.
so we're going to deal with the case where many things can happen but you know what the chances are that they could happen and still lots of things can go wrong in that case.
so there are a couple of words that I want you to know which we went over last time, and I'll just do an example.
we always deal with states of the world, states of nature.
that was Leibniz's idea.
so let's take the simplest case where with probability 1 half you could get 1, and with probability 1 half you could get minus 1.
so that's a random variable.
it might be how your investment does.
half the time you're going to make a dollar.
half the time, you're going lose a dollar.
so this is X, so we define the expectation of X which I write as X bar as the probability of the up state happening so let's just call that 1 half times 1 + 1 half times minus 1 which equals 0.
then I define the variance of X to be, what's the expectation of the squared difference from the expectation?
so how uncertain it is.
you're sort of on average expecting to get 0
so uncertain it is, is measured how far from 0 you are but we're going to square it.
so it's 1 half times squared 1 half times squared = 1 half times 1 1 half times 1 which also equals 1.
so the variance is 1.
and then I'll write the standard deviation of X equals the square root of the variance of X, which equals the square root of 1 which is also 1.
so very often we're going to use the expectation of X that's going to be how good the thing is and the standard deviation is going to be how uncertain it is and people aren't going to like--soon we're going to introduce the idea that people don't like uncertainty and this is the measure of what they do like.
it pays off on average a big number, say, this one doesn't but it could, and the measure of uncertainty is the standard deviation.
I choose that rather than the variance for a reason you'll see.
it makes all the graphs prettier, but also if you double X you'll double the expectation, obviously, because you just double everything inside here.
the variance, though, you're going to end up squaring the two.
if you double X you'll double all these outcomes and the mean so you'll end up multiplying the variance by 4
whereas you'll multiply the standard deviation by 2.
so re-scaling just re-scales these two numbers and has a funny effect on that number.
so that's the reason why we use these two.
now, you could take another example, by the way which is . 9 times 3
let's call this Y, and . 1 times minus something.
how about let's call this 1 third and this minus 3.
now, what's the expectation of Y?
the expectation of Y equals . 3, right equals--just write it out, it's . 9 times 1 third+. 1 times minus 3 which equals . 3-. 3 which equals 0
so the expectation of this random variable is the same as the expectation of that random variable.
and now the variance of this, of Y is . 9 times squared . 1 times squared which equals . 9 times 1 ninth right,+. 1 times 9 which equals . 1+ . 9
which equals 1, which is the same as the other one.
so here we've got another random variable which looks quite different from this, so clearly standard deviation and expectation don't characterize things.
this looks quite different from that one, has the same standard deviation and the same expectation.
so we're going to come back what the difference is between these two variables in a second.
so there's another thing I want to introduce which is the covariance of X and Y.
so we could look at the outcomes of these variables.
where am I going to write this?
I'll write it over here.
we could look at the outcome of these variables in a picture like this, and so here we have X and here we have Y.
so X could turn out to be 1 when Y is 1 third and X could turn out to be 1 when Y is minus 3.
so here's an outcome, and here's an outcome and X could be minus 1, and we could get 1 third or minus 3.
so there are four outcomes looked at here.
so if you looked at X alone it's got a 50/50 chance you're here or here.
if you look at Y alone it's a 90 percent chance up there and a 10 percent chance down there.
so those are called the marginal distributions but the joint distribution we would have to add a number.
so if you looked at X alone, by the way you would say X alone you would say here's 0
here's 1, here's minus 1, so you could have this or this with probability 1 half and 1 half and Y you could have
so we'll draw it this way.
with Y you could have 1 third or minus 3 and here the probability is going to be . 9 and . 1.
this is 0. Those are the pictures that we started with.
so you know where X could end up and where Y could end up well, you don't know where they jointly could end up.
so if they end up on the long diagonal that means when X is high
y tends to be high and vice versa, and if you end up down here X is low and Y is low.
so to the extent that the probability is on the long diagonal they're correlated together.
to the extent that the probability is on the off diagonal they're negatively correlated.
so anyway, to get a sense of that the covariance is going to be the probability of times times the probability of--I'll just go around the circle of times times the probability of sorry what did I just do?
I did minus 1 and 1 third.
I've already done that, so I'm down here.
so times times (minus 3
y bar probability of the ordered pair
student: Should that minus be the X bar or Y bar?
Prof: Thank you.
and probability, what's the point I haven't done yet times times .
so why does that covariance pick up the idea of correlation?
well, to the extent that the probabilities are high here and over there on the long diagonal this term is going to get a lot of weight and what is the other term , and this term is going to get a lot of weight.
so to the extent that you're on the long diagonal this term and this term are going to get a lot of weight but you see those terms this is going to be positive because it's 1 - 0 and 1 third - 0, so that's a positive term.
and this is negative, minus 1 - 0
minus 3 - 0, so a negative times a negative is also positive.
to the extent that you're down here and up there you're going to get big positive numbers in the covariance.
to the extent you're on the off diagonal you'll get big probabilities here, but they all multiply negative terms.
this is a minus and this is a minus, because one of terms is above the mean and the other one is below the mean.
that's what it means to be in the off diagonal.
so covariance is giving you a sense of whether things are moving together or moving the opposite way.
so those are the basic things you have to know.
and I guess another couple things are the covariance is linear in X, right because if you double X every time you see the X variable over here it's always an X outcome minus an X bar an X outcome minus an X bar, an X outcome minus an X bar an X outcome minus an X bar, so if you double X you're going to double every term.
so it's linear in X and in Y, and so one last thing to keep in mind is that the variance of X is just the covariance of X with itself.
obviously if you just plug in X equal to Y you just get the formula for variance and similarly because they're linear the covariance of X+Y so the variance of X+Y, one more formula of X+Y by linearity--first of all that's the covariance of X+Y with itself, and therefore by linearity now
I'm just going to do linear stuff that's equal to the covariance of X with X the covariance of Y with Y +2 times the covariance of X with Y.
since it's linear I just do the linear parts, right?
covariance of X+Y with X+Y is covariance of X+Y with X covariance of X+Y with Y, then I repeat the linearity thing and I get down to that.
so those are basically the key formulas to know.
so now I'm going to make three little observations that come out of all of this that are quite fascinating so quite elementary.
are there any questions about this, these numbers?
yes?
Prof: Why did we give? Say that again.
student: Why did you underline the probably of negative 1, negative 3.
Prof: Probably of negative 1, negative 3.
that's this outcome here.
we underlined it not because it was very likely but because this term is going to be positive.
this is positive and this is positive.
so the whole point is the joint distribution is not specified not determined by the distributions of X alone and Y alone.
so even if I know the probability of what X could do and I know what the probabilities that Y could do that doesn't tell me anything about what numbers I should put on these four outcomes.
for example, I could have at one extreme when X is high Y is high--it can't be exactly that because the probabilities are different.
these numbers and those numbers don't determine these four numbers.
so there are many different numbers I could put in these four squares which would give me in total this probability outcome for X and in total this probability outcome for Y.
so an easy way to see that is if I made them.
so what are the observations I want to make?
for instance, I could say if X turns out to be 1 half then I'll always assume Y turns out to be 1 half and then with the other 40 percent of the time Y might turn out to be--when Y's high X might have to turn out--so here are some ways I could do this.
I could put 50 percent here, . 5 here right?
then 40 percent of the time this is going to turn out--so I have a . 5 here, then what could I do with the rest of this?
this plus this has to add up to 50 percent.
so 50 percent I could have X turn out to be here.
so when X is 1 I could have Y always turn out to be 1
so that means I must have a probability here a probability 0 here because here's X 50 percent.
so this plus this X is going to turn out to be 1, 50 percent of the time.
now, how much of the time is Y going to turn out to be down here a . 1?
so suppose I put these probabilities, . 4?
now, so you see that X is--50 percent of the time X is 1
and 50 percent of the time X is minus 1.
now, how many of the times is Y 1 third, . 5+. 4
so 90 percent of the time, and then 10 percent of the time Y is minus 3.
so here's one way of putting probabilities on the dots that produces this outcome, but I could have chosen another way of doing it, the way that you probably had in mind where I assume they're totally independent.
that is, knowing the outcome of X in this way of doing it if I know that X turned out to be 1, Y has to turn out to be a third.
so they're very dependent.
x is somehow causing Y or determining Y.
x has a lot of information about Y.
suppose I make them independent?
I say what happens here has nothing to with what happens over there.
then I write the probabilities, instead of these
I'd write it . 45.
I'd take 1 half times . 9 is . 45, and then the chance that you go down for X, which is . 5 and up for Y which is also . 45 here, then I'd go . 05 here and . 05 there.
so here, knowing that Y has a good outcome tells you nothing about what X is going to do.
it's still equally likely X was good or bad.
knowing that Y had a bad outcome, X is still likely to be equally likely good or bad.
and similarly knowing the outcome of X tells you nothing about the outcome of Y.
this is 9 times this and this is . 9 times that.
so the yellow is independence, which is probability and)
equals the product, Probability times probability .
so that's the case in independence.
so in the case of independence, knowing something about one variable tells you nothing about what happened to the other variable but you could do other joint things.
so knowing each of them separately doesn't tell you how they're jointly distributed, and the covariance is an effort to see whether they're sort of correlated together or whether they're correlated independently.
so independence, by the way, independence implies covariance equals 0.
that's obvious because what's happening in the X variable's got nothing to do with what's happening in the Y variable.
so since it's linear in X you can hold Y fixed and the X is just the same and you're going to get something that adds up to 0.
so for any fixed value of Y this number will just give you the expectation of X, which won't depend on Y and it's going to be 0 in every case.
so therefore if they're independent their covariance has to be 0.
so, independence means X and Y tell you nothing.
that means the covariance is 0.
they could be positively distributed like up here or negatively distributed, either way you want to do it.
does that make sense? You asked me about this.
Prof: So what are the key simple observations here that are going to inform a lot of our behavior under uncertainty?
well, it's going to turn out that expectation is good and standard deviation is bad.
so if we take this variable that we just found
x and Y were both here, X and Y were both there.
all right, they each had standard deviation 1 and expectation 0, so this is the standard deviation.
so X is here, and by the way so is Y same thing.
well, suppose I put half my money into X and I put half my money into Y, and if I put half my money in each let's say I get half the payoff of each.
I make half a bet and get half the outcome.
what happens to my expectation?
well, the expectation of that obviously equals 1 half X bar +1 half Y bar which also equals 0.
so it's staying the same.
the expectation hasn't moved, but what's the variance of 1 half X 1 half Y?
well, by that formula it's the covariance--so I'm just going to do this formula.
I'm going to add a 1 half here and 1 half here.
so it's the same thing.
so it's the covariance of 1 half X with 1 half X +the covariance of 1 half Y and 1 half Y + 1 half and 1 half.
but the covariance of 1 half X with 1 half X is just okay, what is that?
it's the variance of 1 half X, but we already saw from our definition of variance over here remember, if you double X you're going to multiply the variance by 4 because you're squaring things.
so this is going to turn out to be 1 quarter times the variance of X.
and this, which is 1 half Y and 1 half Y, is going to be 1 quarter times the variance of Y.
and if the two are independent the covariance will be 0.
so in this example, these two variables if I take the orange distribution where they're independent I can do an X outcome and have this standard deviation and this expectation, 0 expectation and that standard deviation, I can do the Y thing get the same standard deviation or I can put half my money in each.
it seems like a total waste of time to put half my money in each.
after all, they give me the same standard deviation, but no, it isn't.
if they're independent you're shockingly, drastically reducing your standard deviation.
because if they're independent the covariance is 0 and so this plus this, the variance of X the variance of Y is just the half the variance of X = half the variance of Y.
so that's shocking.
so the standard deviation, therefore, the square root of that is 1 over the square root.
so by putting half your money in each you've now produced this when they're independent.
so this is the standard deviation of 1 half X 1 half Y independent.
you move from this point to that point.
you reduced your standard deviation without affecting your expectation.
so the first lesson that we're going to see applied this is all mathematics so mathematicians understood this of course, a long time ago, but to realize this has an application to economics wasn't so obvious although Shakespeare knew it.
it's diversification.
so don't put all your, you know, spread your investments out into different waters.
Shakespeare, you know, Antonio had a different ship on each ocean, so instead of putting all the ships on the same ocean he put them on different oceans which he assumed was independent.
so he had the same expected outcome assuming the paths were just as quick to wherever he was selling the stuff the same expected outcome and that each of the waters were equally dangerous, but he drastically reduced his variance.
and because there were a lot of oceans and a lot of ships this number went down further and further.
so the key is to look for independent risks.
so that's one lesson in mathematics that has a big application in economics.
what's a second thing?
well, the second thing is that if you add a bunch of risks together so I'm going to say this loosely.
if you add a bunch of risks together, so by the way what's the generalization of this before I say this?
if you had N independent risks with identical means and variances means let's call them all X bar and variances sigma squared.
let's say they all have expectation E and variance sigma each of them has that then what happens to the--so each of them has standard deviations, so they're all identical.
like X and Y have the expectation 0 and the same standard deviation 1.
suppose I had 20 of those and I put 1 twentieth of money into each of them?
what would happen to my expectation?
1 over N dollars in each one implies what happens to my expectation if expectation equal to what?
each of them had expectation E.
I now split my money among all of them, all with the same expectation.
that also has to have expectation E.
all right, just like this thing putting half my money in Y and half my money in X, wherever the X went.
y was over here.
x is there.
half my money in X and half my money in Y, is going to give me the same expectation.
if I had 12 projects like that that were independent I'd still have the same expectation, but my standard deviation what's going to happen to my standard deviation?
well, the variance is going to be--so what's going to happen to the standard deviation?
student: It would go down.
Prof: By what factor?
Yeah, what's going to happen to the variance?
Prof: Put 1 over N dollars in each of N identical but independent investments, what will my variance be?
Prof: The variance is going to equal 1 over N times sigma squared.
why is that?
because each one will have 1 over N dollars in it so its variance is going to be 1 over N squared times sigma squared, but there are N of them.
so it's going to be N times 1 over N squared so it's just 1 over N, so implies the standard deviation --so I'll call it standard deviation is 1 over the square root of N times sigma.
so it's just this generalization.
we've got 1 over the square root of 2, so if I did N of them instead of 2 of them I'd have 1 over the square root of N.
so those turn out to be very useful formulas which are going to come up over and over again.
and let's just say it again so you get this straight.
if I have two independent random variables and I split my money evenly between them and they have the same expectation it doesn't have to be 0, it could be a positive number if I split my money between them I haven't changed my expectation because each dollar, however I split it
I'm putting it into something with the same expectation.
but because they're independent you get a lot of off diagonal things happening.
the off diagonal things, remember, are canceling.
one investment is turning out well, X is--sorry that's on the diagonal.
the off diagonal elements are good in a way because if one investment's turning out well, sorry, turning out badly the other one's turning out well.
so here investment Y is turning out badly, but X is turning out well.
so to the extent you're off the diagonal you're canceling some of your bad outcomes because one's good and the other's bad.
so that way you leave the expectation the same but you reduce the variance.
in fact it would be even better if you could put everything on the off diagonal, but to the extent you get at least some stuff on the off diagonal you're reducing the risk.
and how fast do you reduce it when they're independent?
you reduce it dividing it equally because the variance is a squared thing, half your money in one and half in the other means the variance of the first is 1 quarter and the variance of the second is 1 quarter but now there are two of them so the total variance is 1 half of what it was before.
if you have 10 of them each one is 1 tenth the money so it's got 1
one-hundredth of the variance, but there are 10 of them so it's 10 one-hundredths, 1 over N of the variance.
if you take the standard deviation it's 1 over the square root of N.
so that's the rate at which you can reduce your uncertainty and your risk.
you'll see this gets much more concrete next lecture.
so this is just stuff that most of you know.
so one more thing, if you add a bunch of independent things together, independent random variables so I'm going to speak very loosely now variables, you get a normally distributed random variable normally distributed random variable with the corresponding expectation and standard deviation.
so what am I saying?
I don't want to speak too precisely about this because if you've seen this before and seen a proof you know everything about it, if you haven't it's just too many subtleties to absorb.
but the normal distributed random variable's the bell curve that looks like that.
it looks like this.
so there's the bell curve with expectation 0.
so it's this bell curve.
now, what's special about it, it has a particular formula which has got an exponential to a minus X squared thing.
anyway, it's got a particular formula to it which if you know you know, if you don't it's written down.
we're never going to use the exact formula but it looks like that.
so these are the outcomes X and this is the probability probability of outcome, or frequency of outcome.
so the bigger X is, and this is the mean--equals 0
I've assumed the mean is 0.
if you take a really big X it's very unlikely to happen and a really small X it's very unlikely to happen and X's nearer the mean are pretty likely to happen.
so anyway, it's amazing that if you add this random variable to itself a bunch of times it can only produce 1 and minus 1 right?
this one produces totally different outcomes 1 third and minus 3, they're disjoint outcomes but if you add this together you can get 25 1s and 10 minus 1s so that gives you 15.
over here you could have--25 will never get me there so sorry, that was a bad example.
if I had 30 things I could get 18 1s and 12 minus 1s that'll give me 6, you could have gotten 6 over here but with 30 outcomes you could get you know, all 30 of them could have turned out to be 1
and that would have gotten you pretty close to the same outcome.
so just because these outcomes are separate once you're adding them up you're starting to produce numbers different from 1 and minus 1
and these added up--if you take the right combination of 1 third and minus a third--you can start reproducing things.
like to get a 1 here you could produce three tops and then you're producing a 1.
so anyway, the shocking thing is if you add a bunch of these random variables that are independent to each other you get something normally distributed that looks like that because this random variable had exactly the same mean and standard deviation.
you add the same number of these you're going to get outcomes that are almost identically distributed.
so in the limit this random variable, enough of these added together looks exactly the same as these added together.
that's the second surprising mathematical fact.
and the third thing that we're going to use is that the normal distribution is characterized by the mean and standard deviation that's all it takes to write the formula of this down and these numbers, these are called thin tailed.
these probabilities go to 0 very fast, so you shouldn't expect many outlying dramatic things to happen.
and in the world they do happen, and so we're going to see that much of classical economics is built on normally distributed things and so you can't see
you shouldn't expect any gigantic outliers to ever happen.
and it seems natural to build it on that kind of assumption because if you add things that are independent you get normal distributions all the time.
and things seem independent so why shouldn't you get normal distributions, and yet we must not get it because we have so many outliers.
so that's the basic background of mathematics.
are there any questions about any of that?
I'm just assuming you know all that and now we're going to move to economics.
I think that's all the background you need.
I want to do one more thing, which is maybe background but it's used in economics all the time, and it's called the iterated expectations.
so if I told you that these variables were correlated like these up here, like the orange things if I told you what X turned out to be that would tell you a lot about what Y was going to be.
so for example, if I told you that X was sorry, the white ones are the correlated ones.
if I tell you that X has turned out to be 1, that tells you that
y has to be a good outcome of 1 third, because if X is one this never happens.
so the only thing that can happen if X is 1 is that Y turns out to be 1 third, so knowing X is going to completely change your mind about the expectation of Y.
so conditional expectation, I should have said this before conditional expectation simply means re-computing expectation using updated probabilities from your information.
now, you've probably done this in high school so I'm just going to assume you know how to do this.
so in this case if I tell you something like X has turned out to be 1 that tells you that only these two outcomes are possible.
so that means that the only two outcomes in the white case have happened with probability of . 5 and 0
but if I tell you X has come out to 1 the conditional probabilities have to add up to 1.
so you just scale things up.
so you know that Y had to have been the good outcome up here.
if I tell you that the bad outcome for Y has happened then you have probabilities of . 1--so this 0 makes things too easy.
suppose I tell you the good outcome of Y has happened.
what are the chances now that X has gotten the good outcome in the white probability case?
if I tell you that Y turned out to be 1 third in the white probability case what's the probability that X turned out to be 1, conditional on that?
student: 5 ninths.
Prof: 5 ninths, so that's it because the probabilities are now--you're reduced with . 4 and . 5
so 5 ninths of the time.
so that's an idea which I assume you all can--it's very intuitive, and it's way too long to explain, and I'm sure you know how to do that.
so anyway, the conditional expectation, blah so the iterated expectation is simply this.
it's an obvious idea, but it's going to be incredibly useful to us.
it says if you ask me what are the chances that the Yankees are going to win the World Series against the Dodgers
let's suppose that's who's going to play the Yankees are going to beat the Dodgers what's the probability that's going to happen?
what do you expect the chances are?
if I then ask you my opinion after the first game well, obviously if the Yankees win the first game my opinion's going to go up, so I'm going to have a different opinion.
if the Dodgers win the first game my opinion is going to go down so I'll have a different opinion.
but you can ask now another question, what's your expected opinion going to be?
so the law of iterated expectations is the expectation of X has to equal the expected expectation of X given some information.
so here is what I think.
the Yankees are 70 percent likely to win.
if I say after the first game if the Yankees win
I'll think it's 80 percent and after the first game if the Dodgers win I'll think it's gone down to 65 percent, it had better be that the average of my opinions after the information is the same as the number I started with.
that's just common sense and I'm not going to bother to prove that.
so that's incredibly important.
it's not only the expectation of X but as you learn stuff you can anticipate your opinion's going to change, but your average opinion has to always stay the same as X was.
so that's the last of the background.
and now I want to do a simple application of this.
so in fact, to that very question, suppose that you're playing a World Series.
the Yankees are playing the Dodgers and let's suppose that the Yankees have a 60 percent chance of winning any game.
I'll just do it here.
the Yankees have a 60 percent chance of winning any game.
what's the chance the Yankees win a 3 game world series?
how do you figure that out?
well, a naive way, a simple way of figuring that out is to say, well, what could happen?
life can mean a Yankee win, let's call that an up or a Yankee loss, let's call that a down and this could happen with probability . 6 or . 4.
the Yankees could win again, so that's probability . 6.
we have two Yankee wins, or the Yankees could lose the second game so that's probability . 4.
the Yankees could lose or could win.
that's . 6 and this is . 4, and we've only played 2 games.
the Yankees could win a third--well you don't need to play this game because they've already won a three game series, but if you did it wouldn't matter, . 4, or we could go up or down.
the Yankees after winning and losing could then win probability . 6, or could lose or after losing and winning they could win again or they could lose.
after losing and winning they could lose, so this is probability . 4 and this is . 6, and then finally we have this and we have this.
so this is . 6 and . 4.
so this is what the tree looks like.
you could imagine 8 possible paths each of length 3 where you give the whole sequence of wins and losses.
so to compute the probability that the Yankees win you look at all the--so in this case the Yankees win.
they would have already won here, but if you play it out it doesn't matter.
they're going to win here and here.
they've got two wins and one loss.
here they've got one win, two wins and one loss. They win.
here they've got loss, win, win.
they win the World Series.
here they lose, win, lose.
they lose the World Series.
here's lose, win--it's win lose, lose, they also lose the World Series.
here it's lose, lose, they've lost the World Series, loss.
so these are the possible outcomes.
so you could compute the probability of every path there are 8 of them, and then multiply that probability by the outcome and you'll get the chance that the
Yankees will win the World Series, right?
that's clear to everybody?
but there's a much faster way of doing it and putting it on a computer, and that's using the law of the iterated expectation.
so first of all--so this is called a tree.
so we're going to use trees all the time.
so tree, I don't want to formally define it.
it's just you start with something and stuff can happen.
stuff happens every period, and so you just write down all the things that can happen.
and then you write down all the things that can happen after that and the thing unfolds like a tree.
that's formal enough to describe a tree and here we've got it.
but you notice that the tree the number of things happening grows exponentially.
it's horrible to have to compute something growing exponentially but they're often recombining trees.
Oh, so if I ask, by the way, in this tree whatever the opinion is here, which turns out to be . 68 something yeah, I should have asked you to guess, . 68 something.
if you write down the opinion that opinion has to be the average of the opinion here and the opinion here.
so if I take the opinion here times . 6 plus the opinion here times . 4 that's also going to equal . 68.
and that's what's going to be the key to computing the thing much faster rather than going through every branch which is such a pain because there are an exponentially growing number of paths very bad to have to compute by hand.
but we notice that we can look at a recombining tree.
these two nodes are essentially the same.
what difference does it make if the Yankees win one and lose one, or lose one and win one?
in both cases they're at the same spot.
they're even in the World Series.
and since we assume the probability of winning any game is the same, . 6 and . 4, independent of what's happened before--you might think you're learning something about, "Oh, their starter pitched here and he didn't last the whole game" and stuff like that.
so I'm not allowing for any of that.
I'm just saying it's a chance for the Yankees to win no matter what happens.
so all you care about at any point from then on is who's won how many games.
so these nodes are basically identical and these nodes are identical, because it all ended up with the Dodgers ahead 2 to 1, and here the Yankees were ahead 2 to 1, and here the Yankees were ahead 3 to 0, and 0 to 3.
so the recombining tree which has all the same information is just this, this, this, this tree.
so this three only has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
has far--it's 1 node, 2 nodes, 3 nodes and 4 nodes as time goes by growing linearly instead of growing 1
to 2, to 4, to 8 which is growing exponentially.
so I could have a very long World Series and write it as a finite tree and just . 6 and . 4 here at every stage.
so how am I going to solve this now?
well, over here I know the Yankees ended up winning all 3 games.
here they won 2, here they won 1
here they won none.
so those are the outcomes.
so instead of trying to figure out path by path through these exponential number of paths what the chances of each path are, why it's hard to compute here it's . 6 times . 6 times . 4, a complicated calculation
I'm now going to do something simple.
I'm going to say, what would I think if the
Yankees had already won 2 games?
well, I know that they would win.
that's a 1.
the series is already over.
what would I think after the Dodgers won the first two games?
I'd know it was over.
what would I think--so how did I get that?
it's . 6 times 1+. 4 times 1.
that's 1, the Dodgers . 6 times 0+. 4 times 0 that's 0
so that's my opinion if the Dodgers win 2 games.
here's my opinion if the Yankees won 2 games.
what would my opinion be if they split?
well, if they split what would my opinion be if I started here?
so after game 2 they've each won 1 game.
I don't know who won the first one, but it was 1 to 1 after 2 games.
now what would I think?
student: . 6 times 1+. 4 times 0.
Prof: Exactly, so it's . 6.
it's . 6 times 1+. 4 times 0.
so the odds, I would think the Yankees would win the World Series here with 1 game left knowing that they win 60 percent of the time it's . 6.
but now what do I think if the Yankees win the first game?
what's my opinion?
student: . 6 times 1+. 4 times . 6.
Prof: So it's . 6 times 1
so it's . 6+. 4 times . 6, so that's . 24
so that's . 84 here, and what's my opinion after the
Yankees lose the first game and the Dodgers win?
what do I think is going to happen?
what will my opinion be here?
it's . 6 times having an opinion of . 6, so it's . 36, . 4 times knowing that it's all over . 4 times 0.
so it's equal to . 36.
so I've now figured out--not only am I solving this thing much faster than I could over there, but I'm finding interesting numbers on the way.
I'm now figuring out what would I think after the Yankees won the first game?
well, now I think it's 84 percent.
what would I think after the Dodgers won the first game?
I'd think it was only a 36 percent chance of the Yankees winning.
so now what's my opinion at the very beginning?
it's . 6 times . 84 (it's my chance of having this opinion plus my chance of having that opinion). 4 times . 36.
Oh no, . 504 +. 144 what is that?
student: . 648.
Prof: . 648, 6 times 84 looks like 504 and 4 times 36
looks like 144, so it looks like . 648 and that's what you said.
so that's it. I've solved it now.
so that's the method of iterated expectation and we're going to turn this into quite an interesting theory in a second but I want to now put that on a computer to show you just how completely obvious this is, I mean, not obvious fast this is.
so you could solve for any number of--a series of any length you could instantly solve.
now, we're going to price bonds that way too.
so class--so what did I do? I--this is a spreadsheet you had.
I simply had the probabilities of the Yankees winning which was . 6
which I could change.
Prof: So this is the simplest thing to do but now suppose that--so we said the Yankees can win every game with probability . 6.
so then what did I do?
I went down to here.
I gave myself some room.
I didn't do a very long series.
so now what does each of these things say?
each of these nodes, like that one says if I can read it, it says--so this is my opinion of winning the World Series.
it says my opinion here is going be the chance I go up.
that's the probability, that's A 2
that's . 6, the chance I go up times what my opinion would be over here, plus the chance that I go down which is here, the chance I go to here which is 1 minus that number . 6 that's frozen up there times whatever I thought would be my opinion here.
so you see that's the same--I just write that once.
I wrote that once here, that thing about the probability, my opinion there is the probability of going up.
that's A, dollar A dollar 2, that's . 6
it's frozen, times what my opinion would be and the square over 1 and up 1 plus 1 minus dollar A dollar 2
times my opinion over 1 and down 1.
so I just copied that as many times I wanted to down the column and then I copied it again across all the rows.
so all of these entries are identical, they're all just copies of each other.
so it's just says iterate your opinion from what you know it was forward.
now, how do I take a 3 game World Series?
well, we're starting here.
this'll be game 1, game 2, game 3
so all I have to do now is put 1s everywhere here like 1 enter and now I'll copy this, ctrl, copy and go all the down here.
so that's it. So we've got all the numbers.
so why is that?
because my opinion here--remember the numbers we got?
the series goes 1 game, 2 games, 3 games so if you end up above the middle that means the Yankees won the majority of games.
your pay off is 1.
your probability of the Yankees wining is 1.
so now what's your opinion going to be?
if you've won 2 games then the Yankees have to have won.
what if the Yankees win the first game?
remember the numbers we got 1, and . 6, and 0
so here's the . 84.
it's the average of 1 and . 6.
here's the . 36 which was the average of . 6 and 0.
and then we come down to the middle which is . 648.
so what do I do if I want to play a 7 game World Series?
I have to get rid of this, and if it's a 7 game World
series I would just--now I want to restore what I had before, so I'm going to copy all this ctrl, copy, ctrl.
so I'm back to where I was before.
so you see what I'm doing here?
the game hasn't started.
this is the first game, second game third game, fourth game, fifth game, sixth game, seventh game.
every square is just saying my opinion is my average of what my opinion will be next time.
if I want to make it a 7 game World Series I just plug in 1s here.
there must be some faster way of doing this but I plug in 1s here.
so ctrl, copy and here are all the 1s down to above the thing ctrl V, and now I've solved my opinion backwards and I've got the chances of the Yankees winning a 7 game World Series are 71 percent.
so the longer the World Series goes the better the chances are the Yankees win if they're better in each individual game and you can do it instantly.
so are there any questions about that?
so that is a trick we're going to use over and over again to price bonds.
you do it by backward induction because of the law of iterated expectations.
your opinion today of what's going to happen way in the future when you get a lot of information has to be the average opinion you're going to have after you get some information, but before you know what the final outcome is.
and so realizing that, you just take the pieces of information one by one and work backwards from the end and you can solve things instantly which would take in the brute force way an exponentially growing length of time to do if you did them path by path.
I now want to turn to an application of this to one subject which is, let's just not do the World Series.
let's do a more interesting problem.
I hope I have time to finish this story.
so the more interesting problem is this.
let's suppose our uncertainty's of a different kind.
instead of not knowing the outcome of the World Series let's say we don't know how impatient we are.
so remember the most important idea so far that we've seen because we haven't done uncertainty yet the most important idea we've seen so far is impatience.
that's the reason why you get an interest rate and the interest rate is the key to finding out the value of everything.
so Irving Fisher put tremendous weight on impatience.
and now that we're talking about uncertainty the natural thing to make uncertain is how impatient you're going to be.
so we want to talk a little bit more about impatience.
so impatience by Irving Fisher is the discount.
so in fact I want to talk about this in sort of realistic terms.
do we really believe that people just discount the future 1 year they discount by delta, 2 years discount by delta squared 3 years by delta cubed, 4 years by delta to the fourth.
is it really true that every year people think of as delta less important as the year before?
I mean, the argument for this is you might not live beyond a certain--you know, poor imagination so imagination, poor imagination we've said this before, poor imagination and mortality are the two arguments for discounting.
but let me tell a story that seems to contradict that.
suppose someone asks you to clean your room and they give you a choice of doing it--I can give my son for example.
say I--"Clean your room Constantin
and so if I say do it today or do it tomorrow that makes a huge difference to him, I mean just a huge difference doing it today from doing it tomorrow.
he'll think doing it today is just impossible doing it tomorrow I can almost force him into agreeing to that.
so clearly there's a big discount between today and tomorrow but what about between a year from now and a year and a day from now?
do you think Constantin will think there's any difference in that?
the answer is no.
if I say, "Constantine, do you agree to clean it 365
days from now or 366 days from now, " to him there's hardly any difference, but there's hardly any tradeoff.
one is hardly more valuable than the other of course, they're both pretty unimportant, but the ratio of the two doesn't even seem important to him.
so that's called hyperbolic discounting.
if you do any experiment with people or with animals you make a bird do something and if he does more stuff he gets the things faster, he'll do a lot of stuff to get it in the next minute as opposed to in 2 minutes but the difference between what he'll do in 10 minutes versus 11
minutes is very small.
so hyperbolic discounting is discounting much less than exponential discounting.
so this has a tremendous importance for the environment.
if you thought that people exponentially discounted like they thought each year was only 95 percent if the interest rate's 5 percent it sounds like the discounting is . 95, so if next year's only 95 percent as important as this year and the year after that is only 95 percent as important as the first year, and the third year is only 95 percent as important as the second year . 95 in 100 years to the hundredth is an incredibly small number.
so there's no point in doing something today and investing a lot resources in order to clean up the environment and help people 100 years from now, because by discounting it this much nobody could, you know, what's the difference because the future's so unimportant.
you shouldn't be investing resources now to do something that's going to have such a small effect later.
so in all the reports on the environment a crucial half of the report is devoted to what the discount rate should be.
so, but they never thought of doing the most obvious thing which is to ask what would happen if the discounting was uncertain.
all of these are certain discount rates.
so what if you made the discounting uncertain what would you imagine doing?
so suppose you discount today at 100 percent and maybe next period you're going to discount at 200 percent this is the interest rate and here it might go down to 50 percent.
it could go up to 400 percent or it could go down to 100
percent again, or it could go down to 25 percent you know, this kind of discounting I have in mind.
you don't know--so delta = 1 over , and this is r r_0, r_up, r_down.
so maybe the discount is uncertain and it goes like that.
so it's a geometric random walk.
I keep multiplying or dividing by 2.
I multiply or divide by 2. I multiply or divide by 2.
that seems to make for a lot of discounting.
these numbers are going up very fast.
the higher the r, the less you care about the future.
so the question is if you ask for a dollar sometime in the future what will people be willing to pay for it?
so you know today that you think the future is only half as important as the present.
let's say these all have probability of half.
and tomorrow it might be that you think the future is only 2 thirds the next year's only 2 thirds as important as that current year or you might think the future's only 1 third as important as this year.
so you see how this is working?
two years from now you might think the future's only 1 fifth the third year's only 1 fifth as important as the second year.
here you might think the third year is half as important as the second year.
here you might think it's 4 fifths as important as the third [correction: second]year.
so you don't know what it's going to be and if anything this process seems to give you a bias towards getting really high numbers, high discounts meaning the future doesn't matter.
so, but nobody bothered to stop--so this is the most famous interest rate process in finance.
this is called the Ho-Lee interest rate model where you think today's interest rate might be 4 percent.
maybe it'll be 10 percent higher next year or 10 percent lower and it'll keep going up and down like that and that's the uncertainty about the interest rate.
so if we think interest rates are so important and patience is so important, and we want to add uncertainty the first place to do it is to the interest rate and the Ho-Lee model in finance does that.
nobody bothered to compute this out more than 30 years.
compute what out?
suppose you get 1 dollar for sure in year 1.
how much would you pay for 1 dollar in year 1?
well, your discount is 100 percent.
you'd pay 1 half a dollar.
how much would you pay for 1 dollar in year 2?
well, you know how much more a dollar now is worth than 1 year from now, but you don't know 2 years from now so you have to work by backward induction.
here 1 dollar for sure is worth 1 dollar.
what would I pay for it here?
I'd pay 1 third of a dollar.
what would I pay for it here?
well, the discount is 2 thirds.
I'd pay 2 thirds of a dollar.
so what would I pay for it back here?
I'd pay 1 half times 1 third+1 half times 2 thirds discounted by 100 percent.
so that's 1 third+1 sixth which is 1 half, times 1 half which is 1 quarter, I guess.
so I'd pay 1 quarter.
so for any time I could figure out D = amount I would pay
I'm going to be done in one minute the amount I would pay today for 1 dollar for sure at time t.
and that number, obviously, is going to go down as time goes up, and we know how to compute it by backward induction.
you just put the 1s further and further out and then you go backwards by backward induction.
but just like for the World Series I could do that any T however big I want to, and on a computer and the spreadsheet which I wrote for you you could do this instantly.
and nobody bothered to do this for T bigger than 30 because bonds basically don't last for more than 30 years so what's the point in doing it for T bigger than 30?
so 100 years--there are virtually no financial instruments that are 100 years long because they didn't bother to do this.
suppose you did it for every T up to 1, 000 years?
well, you could do it on a computer very easily.
you could even prove a theorem of what it's like.
so in the problem set I'm going to ask you do a few of these and what you're going to find is that people are hyperbolic that you get--you discount a lot.
it's pretty close to 100 percent for the first few periods but after that you're going to be anyway, you're going to find out what the numbers turn out to be when you do it on a computer.
so we're going to start with random interest rates next period the most important variable in the economy.
I'm here for you. Whatever you need.
Really?
you slept with him.
I swear...There was no sleeping.
you had a script that was going around back then.
it was all anyone talked about.
I'd love to read it again.
we're not looking to do another show here.
don't be mad at me. - All right.
I was just at a meeting with Kim Sally over at Fox.
do you mind if I show it to her?
you knew from the beginning there were only two things I asked...
be nice and don't cheat.
I was nice.
morning.
hello. - Hey.
so, uh, we were thinking, it might be nice before we go back to London, what do you say you and Jamie come over for dinner?
maybe this weekend?
uh, actually, Jamie and I are kind of done.
what? No. - You're kidding.
Yeah. So...
I can't believe it. - When did this happen?
uh, few days ago.
and you never said anything.
I wish you'd told us what happened.
it doesn't matter.
I don't suppose it had anything to do with your little thing with morning's daughter.
might've.
Oh, my God. You stupid, stupid man.
stupid.
you cared so much about her, and to lose her over something like this...
what are you gonna do?
so that's it?
that's the extent of your emotional pain?
what do you want me to say? - Something! Be a human being!
is there no guilt? No regret?
so this isn't over.
you're just gonna let her go?
as opposed to? - Fight for her!
beg her forgiveness! Look at what you're losing.
she was the best thing that ever happened to you.
she made you a better person.
Yeah, okay. I'm getting breakfast.
can we walk and do this?
what do you want from me? Shit happens.
shit didn't happen. You made the shit happen.
whatever.
you cheated on her with a 19-year-old.
did you see the 19-year-old? Huh?
Oh, no. You're not taking me down with you.
well, I hope it was worth it.
you threw away a wonderful relationship with an extraordinary woman.
Hey, she was supposed to be gone all week.
it's not my fault she came back early.
my God. You should be studied by doctors.
then she shows up, sniffing around like some detective.
you heartless fucker. Are you dead inside?
probably.
you think this is Turkey bacon or regular bacon?
turkey. There's the regular.
you're a sociopath.
so I guess dinner's off.
even if you were starving.
Hey.
maybe the next one's better.
okay. Whenever you're ready.
I'm Rena Keevey reading for the Untitled Shelly Siegler pilot.
she just did this play in New York.
she's supposed to be brilliant.
Ooh. I like that.
I'm not speaking to you.
Really? Sounds like you are.
well, I shouldn't be.
I so didn't want to take Aaron to that party.
I knew it was a bad idea.
what happened? - What happened?
we had a great time, is what happened.
are her ears funny?
...amazing, and now they...
are they? - Maybe.
they're kind of like little bat ears.
is that what it is?
Mm-mmm.
well, if we go to series, she could always get them clipped or something.
would she do that? - For a series?
that's not for me. - What?
I don't know. Is she a show?
she doesn't feel like a show.
she feels more best-friendy.
this is for the best friend.
is she too pretty for the best friend?
only if the lead girl's another bat.
she looks like someone I went to camp with.
was she a show? Can we get her?
what am I gonna do?
I'm not getting the "brilliant" thing.
she's got big hands.
she's like a less funny what's-her-name.
sleep with him?
what do you think?
Mm. Her voice annoys me.
I don't know how we're going to cast this.
there's nobody good left.
Carol? Castor needs to see you.
okay.
right away.
Oh. All right.
keep going without me.
I guess something came up.
Hello? - Sean, hi.
it's Eileen Jaffee. - Oh, hello.
you sound out of breath.
I just got a new desk. I think I've got it set too high.
all right.
so, Kim read your script.
that was fast. - I know.
and, of course, she loved, loved, loved it.
Really? - Mm-hmm.
she said she laughed her ass off.
she thought it was fresh.
she thought it was different.
she said you guys blew her socks off.
well, hopefully she has someone to blow them back on.
I have no idea what that means.
glasses.
anyway, here's where it gets a little tricky.
what do you mean,"tricky"?
she wants to make it.
I know we said that was off the table, but she said it's exactly what she's looking for, and she thinks, with the right casting, this could be a big fucking hit.
Oh, my God.
and, by the way, did I tell you?
kim passes on almost everything.
well, obviously, it's incredibly flattering, and if it were just me, I'd do it in a heartbeat.
Well...Maybe we can get bev on board.
I'd say it's unlikely.
never hurts to ask.
that's not always true, but I'll talk to her tonight.
the sooner, the better. - No, I know.
but I think if I broach it in the middle of a hellish "Pucks" day, she's less likely to re-enlist.
God. They're still making you shoot those?
is no one looking out for you guys?
who's representing you here?
uh, no one. We've just still got our agent from the U. K...
I know Stanley, from my London days.
how old must he be by now?
no one knows. Everyone else his age is dead.
I remember. He makes the best Christmas cookies.
Oh, absolutely. He's famous for them.
well, I don't know if that's what I'd want my agent to be famous for, but they are delicious.
I'm telling you, it is the hottest sex I have ever had.
so it's gonna be one of those walks.
we'll be in the office, and all of a sudden, he just, like, wants me and takes me...
right there!
it's like nothing I've ever...
well, didn't you and Merc sometimes, you know, in the office?
uh, yeah. But it's totally different.
this is like "Fifty Shades of Grey" hot.
that was just...
fifty Shades of Gray. - Ew!
get this...
when we're doing it, he won't let me look at him.
you're not allowed to look at him?
Nope.
of course, I do, but only when he's not looking.
and you like that?
well, he likes it, so...
I want to make him happy.
and do you get to tell him what makes you happy?
Oh, he doesn't like it when I talk.
ever? - During.
that's nice.
in fact... - Yes?
...sometimes he puts his hand over my mouth.
Oh, my God. Can you breathe?
Yeah. Through my nose.
and sometimes he opens his fingers a little bit, or I pry them apart.
fun.
you ever heard of anything like that?
not since Patty hearst was kidnapped.
you think it's weird?
far be it for me to judge what anyone does in the bedroom or over a desk.
but you think it's fucked up? - Little bit. Yeah.
but...if you're okay with it, and you're having fun the rest of the time...
what do you mean? Those are the times.
I mean, like...
when you go out to dinner.
you don't go out to dinner?
well, not yet.
anything?
movies?
hanging out at his house?
Oh, I haven't been to his house yet.
we only have sex in the office.
we're taking it slow.
what are you making?
Oh. It started out as chicken stir-fry.
it may have got away from me.
are those raisins?
I'm trying to use up everything in the cupboard before we go home.
Ah. That's potentially terrifying.
Oh. You know who called?
who's Eileen Jaffee?
that agent we met at the restaurant.
Oh. Right. What'd she want?
she loved the script we sent her.
Aww. That's nice. Taste.
what's sweet?
amaretto biscuits. We had a few left.
right. You know, not everything has to be an ingredient.
uh, anyway...Eileen loved the script so much...
Mm?
...she sent it to a friend of hers who's a big deal at Fox who apparently also loved, loved, loved it.
three "loves."That's almost too many.
according to Eileen, this woman, Kim something, was so knocked out...
Oh, dear God. - ...she wants to make it.
thought we should at least discuss it.
right.
well, my side of the conversation will be brief.
you're thinking no.
I'm thinking no. I'm praying no. I'm begging no.
which is what I figured you'd say.
look, I get it.
it's flattering.
Oh, but these fuckers are always flattering.
they're professionally flattering.
heh, right. - Darling, please.
let's stick to the plan. It's a good plan.
we're gone in two weeks. We're so close.
we're the Von Trapps escaping over the alps.
we can make it.
Maria, please, let's not go back and give the Nazis one more song.
did I see Jamie's car in front of the stage this morning?
Yeah. Why?
so, does this mean you two are?
Oh, no, no, no. She left some of her crap at my house, so my assistant was giving it back to her driver.
Ah. Your assistant and her driver.
sounds like quite the emotional goodbye.
uh, hey, don't you start giving me shit, too.
I'm sorry, but I'm kind of with bev on this one.
we worked so bloody hard to save our relationship.
and you...you just throw it away like...
tissues. - Fuck you. Tissues.
I've worked hard on relationships.
right.
I have. - Really?
you think me and Diane didn't try?
we did everything we could.
we went to counseling. We had a threesome.
that's your idea of "working hard"?
it is if you're doing it right.
Aw, come on. All right.
you want to know the truth? Huh?
it was a fucking disaster.
Aw. Your threesome was a disaster?
it was.
look, the whole thing was Diane's idea.
we were already in the shitter, and she thought bringing in another girl might help.
and, of course, you didn't say no.
anyway, Diane gets this friend of hers, some girl from her yoga class.
and she's totally up for it. So she comes over.
we have some wine, and we all get into bed.
and the disastrous part is?
turns out I was into the friend way more than Diane.
I mean, Diane's awesome, but she's the mother of my children, so...
so more difficult to objectify?
no, no, no. Looser pussy.
what?
you know, you push two kids out of there. It's...
but this other girl was...
Hello? - Hi, honey.
it's Eileen. Did you have a chance to talk with bev?
Ohh. Y-yes. Yes, I did.
so?
so pretty much as we expected.
she said no? - She said no.
don't suppose there's any wiggle room?
uh, no. We are snug.
well, we tried. - That we did.
meanwhile, guess who I just talked to.
stanley Richardson. - Really?
I had to call him about another piece of business, but we were talking about you guys and how excited Fox is about your script.
which can't happen. - Which can't happen.
but if something did happen,
stanley said he'd be fine with us working together on it.
how are you with that?
but nothing's gonna happen.
exactly.
well, if you want half of nothing, I'm sure it's all right.
great! Well, I'll call Kim and give her the bad news.
do you believe this?
I've got the only clients who don't want a show picked up!
sorry about that.
Oh, please. Don't give it another thought.
have a good one, sweetie. Bye-bye.
Robbie, can I have my coconut water now, or should I just go fuck myself?!
that was so...
is it okay to talk now?
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, good. That was great.
have you seen my phone?
what?
Oh, there it is.
so, uh...
...you want to do something? - What do you mean?
you know, like, maybe go out for dinner or...
no. - Oh. Okay.
maybe another night.
anything else you want to do?
want to get my car washed.
great.
great.
good idea .
who wants a corn dog?
Nah. - That's okay.
let me rephrase that. I want a corn dog.
daddy? - Yeah?
there's that lady who mommy hates.
well, that could be a lot of people.
Oh, Jesus.
uh, Ok. You know what.
why don't you guys go play on the massage chair at brookstone, and I'll meet you there in a little while, okay?
okay! - Hurry.
I'll race you.
Seriously? - Oh, my God! Hi!
what are you doing? I'm here with my kids.
if Diane finds out you're still doing this, I am totally fucked!
I'm not! I swear.
right. You're telling me this is a coincidence?
Yeah. I guess sometimes they really happen.
come on. I'm not stupid.
we've been here too many times.
I wasn't, really. - Labes!
Hey. - Hey.
Hi. - Sorry.
I had to park on the street.
can you believe these fuckers are charging to park here now?
it's okay. I just got here, too.
Hey. - Joe, this is Matt.
you're...
Hey.
how do you guys...
uh, so, back when I was supposed to die,
Matt was my make-a-wish wish.
no shit. - Yeah.
and we've stayed friends ever since.
Yeah. That's, uh...Yeah.
very cool. I love your show.
Seriously?"Pucks"?
what's "Pucks"? - Right.
thank you. So, you guys...
you're like... - Yeah. We are like.
so, when did...How did you...
remember the last time that I saw you?
uh...Yeah.
so, the next day, I'm, like, in Starbucks.
and you know how they call your name?
well, this guy laughs...Like it's funny.
come on!"Labia"?
I thought you were just fucking with them.
Yeah. So I'm like,"look, sorry if it's not as interesting as 'Joe.'
it was on my cup. - Sure.
so, anyway, we got to talking, and then...
I don't know...we got to doing other stuff.
and we're still doing it.
so, how are you? Are you well?
Yeah. I'm well. Are you...well?
Yeah. I am. I'm good. It's healthy.
we're "healthy"? - Yeah. We're very healthy.
okay. It's better when you say it like that.
well, anyway, we're gonna go get tattoos, so...
it was nice meeting you. - Yeah.
take care. - Yeah.
see you around.
or not.
the kids. I...
so, I spoke to Kim about the script. Of course, she's heartbroken.
but she's a big girl. She gets it.
well, thank her again for us.
if you want, you can thank her yourself.
she'd love to take you guys to lunch before you fly home.
Really?
she just wants to meet you and tell you what a huge fan she is.
Uh...Let me talk to bev and see if she's up for it.
no pressure. Let me know.
see if she's up for what?
that woman from Fox wants to take us to lunch.
didn't... - bup-bup-bup!
she totally gets that she can't have our script.
then why... - she just wants to tell us what a big fan she is.
which we already know. Thank you, woman from Fox.
might be nice. Free lunch.
darling, I'd happily pay for her Cobb Salad if I didn't have to be there when she eats it.
so that's a no, then? - It's a no, with blue cheese on the side.
so, you're down to, what...
twice a week with the seritaxyl? - Right.
still experiencing any unwanted, uh...
erectile incidents?
some. Not as many. - Good.
in that case, we can probably stop with the seritaxyl entirely and start increasing the limatran.
that one doesn't make you horny, does it?
no. In fact, quite the opposite.
sometimes there's actually a lessening of sexual interest.
good. From your lips to my dick.
isn't this what you wanted...
for her to get over you?
Yeah. Sure. But being dumped by your stalker?
come on, now. You had a good run.
I guess.
it's just weird knowing I'll probably never have another one.
you don't know that.
Nah. That was it.
you think Harrison Ford's still getting stalkers?
or Warren beatty?
there's a window.
we lead very different lives.
you know, I've had other stalkers, but...
nothing like this.
this was 15 years.
I met her when she was a kid.
they grow up so fast.
no, seriously.
it's probably the longest relationship of my life.
that's not disturbing at all.
all those years I put up with her shit...
now she decides it's over?
Oh, come on. It's for the best. You know it is.
Yeah, yeah.
but she's seemed so...over me.
you know? Like I was just some...person.
I used to look into her eyes and see the crazy.
today...
nothing.
it was like... Like the light went out.
now he doesn't even want to have sex with me.
never? Nope.
he won't let me touch him.
he's distant. He's moody.
although from the sounds of it, he was always distant and moody.
the only difference is, now he's not fucking you over a desk.
I know.
what did I do?
maybe I pushed too hard.
did I push too hard?
all I did was ask him if he wanted to have dinner.
Oh, you demanding bitch.
well, then why? - Does it matter?
just be thankful that it's over.
you really think it's over? - I hope so.
from everything you said, he's emotionally detached...
possibly a misogynist.
he wouldn't let you look at him or talk to him when you're having sex.
listen, you can find negative things to say about anybody.
he covered your mouth with his hand.
not always!
fine!
Oh, God.
why does this keep happening to me?
am I ever gonna be happy?
Yes. - Really?
I don't know.
I...I always just assumed that, one day,
I'd end up with some great guy who's not married and not fucked up.
but what if this is it?
what if this isn't the shit I have to go through to get to the good part?
what if this is the good part?
what's the matter? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sure it's just this, but...
...you're making me very sad.
Oh, my God.
my life is making you cry?
Oh, my God!
Oh, no, no. No, don't you start!
I'm sorry! - No.
no, I'm sorry!
No! I'm sorry!
is...is there any more of that chicken-raisin-cookie shit?
Oh, there's tons.
I'm afraid it's a no on lunch.
Aw. Really? - Bev just isn't up for it.
we've got a lot to do. Starting to pack and whatnot.
gotcha. Well, that's fine.
unless you want to do it without her.
um...I don't think so. It feels a little weird.
sweetie, it's a sandwich, not a blow job.
although she really wants that script.
right.
and you'll love Kim. She used to run Comedy Central, so you know she's funny.
look, it's your call. Just think about it.
Oh, there she is!
Hi, sweetie! - Hello.
kim Sally, as promised, this is Sean Lincoln.
hello. Oh. Please.
actually, do it again. No, no.
okay, all right. Let's take a seat.
Oh, I'm so sorry we're this late.
there was crazy traffic, as per usual in this town.
really, that's I guess my program to be as late as we were.
let's run it again, okay?
I go to kick you in the head. - Yeah.
you duck under my leg... - Right - ...grab the leg... - Yeah ...then kick my other leg out from under me.
okay. Got it. Let's do it.
you don't need to mark it again?
no, no, no. I'm good. Let's go.
okay. On 3. 1...2... - Wait. Is it on 3...
you're shitting me.
you're sure?
this is awesome! Well, let me know.
good news?
you know that guy who got my part in the NBC pilot?
just had a kickboxing accident.
paralyzed! -Oh, my God.
temporarily, but long enough that he can't do the pilot.
the man is paralyzed.
Temporarily! Jesus!
be happy for me for once!
we are back, baby!
you can'tlet this happen, Tony. No!
come on, Mom, you've got to wake up.
what they got you for?
I helped some people get some medications they needed.
thanks for bailing me out. I'll make sure you getyour money right back...
Greg. I told you to shut it down.
why didn'tyou do that?
Oh, my God.
I got a little boyand a man with extensive burns!
it started downstairs. - In my apartment.
I want you to put your hand in that vise there.
I want youto feel that.
dying is Easy...
plenty morewhere that came from.
there we go. Here, come on.
come on, eat.
I've been slaving over a hot griddle all morning for you.
please, at leasttry it, okay?
here you go, there's a fork.
satisfied? - No, I'm not, and I'm not goingto be satisfied until I hear, "Wow, Tony, I can'tbelieve you made me your world famous pancakes."
wow, Tony, I can't believe you made me your world famous pancakes.
all right, here'syour lunch. It's time to go.
are kids gonna act weirdto me today?
no.
I don't want to talk about Mom. - You don't have to.
are you sending me to live with Grandma and Grandpa?
why do you ask that?
isn't that what you were talking about at the funeral?
we were talking about a lot of things at the funeral.
I don't want to live with them.
I want to stay here with you and your crummy pancakes.
Bye. - Bye.
x rays showyour lungs are improving.
Oh, good. I need inhale
well, if your oxygenlevel stays up, you can go home and .
tell Timmy. He's been worriedsick about me.
so has Alex.
how is he?
he's, uh...
he's been acting weird.
you think he did it, don't you?
I know I blew outthose candles.
I don't believe it. He's a good boy.
you know, he's stealing Dr. Morris' credit card, he's disrespecting you.
I don't know what to think. - If he did do it,
I'm sure it wasn't on purpose.
do you think Alex started that fire by accident?
I thinkyou should continue to take him to that therapist lady.
as far as the police go, they think it was a candle.
let it go at that.
well, I'm glad tohear he's doing okay.
Yeah, he just needed a little time for the hand to heal.
look what we have here: not one but two late doctors.
the Blue Line was stuck.
some bozo jumped infront of the train. - Where's your main man?
um, he's gonna takeone more day.
Yeah, no problem, I got it covered. Then cover this.
some suit camefrom upstairsand said to give that towho's ever running the floor.
damn. - Damn.
Where's Pratt?
you suck balls! - Hold still, ma'am.
hold still yourself, bitch! - Can we give Benzos IM?
that'll take a halfan hour to work. - Okay.
all right, I got access. What do you want? Four Ativan?
Ativan? - Haldol? What?
you're ruining my high, you retard!
Pratt, we need to talk. - Yeah, I'm a little busy here, Morris.
get me midazolam. - Okay.
faster onset, knock her downin less than a minute.
can we, uh, step outside, Greg? - Yeah, sure, soon as shesettles down, Morris.
settle on this! - Watch out!
Pratt, I-I'm, I'm really sorry, but I'm gonna have to...
you're gonna haveto wait, Morris. Please, one minute.
let go of me! - Pratt.
you scum of the earth. - Pratt!
What?!
the Medical Boardsuspended your license.
Hey, uh, can we talk?
Yeah, sure, what can I do for you?
I was Pratt's accomplice.
excuse me? - I, I helped him at the clinic.
what? - I know, I know.
it seemed like the right thing to do at the time.
I can't believe this.
look, I told Pratt that he didn't have to protect me, but he wants me to stay out of it.
well, listen to Pratt.
I'm gonna burn in hell, aren't I? - No.
I mean, you might have some explaining to do.
Hey, I'm sorryabout this, man.
I thought I could at least work half a shift before the hearing.
well, it's just a formality. They'll reinstate you.
GI bleeds from NSAIDs happen to thousands every year.
Morris, Abby's asking for you. Her guy in One is throwing up.
be strong, brother. Fight the power.
a liter wide open? - Yeah, and ten of reglan.
okay, does it hurt here?
no, but if you tug on Willie, I'll sing Dionne Warwick's greatest hits.
tempting, but no thanks. - No, really, I...
I thought that's why you put the gloves on.
seriously, I havea latex fetish.
I even tried to give myself a Brazilianusing rubbercement once.
didn't work, butI got into Hustleras one of those guys who has the three, uh...
all right, I get it, yeah. - Ever had food poisoning?
I puked once after biting into a Red Hot with stretch marks.
okay, uh...we have to run some tests to rule out anything serious like appendicitis, but after that, hopefully we can discharge you.
what's up with this guy?
vomiting, low-grade fever, exam is equivocal.
doc, Doc...You gotta get me out of here, man.
I got a hot date tonight.
does, uh, she take air or helium?
she takes Visa, but that was funny.
can I use it? - Sure.
do you want meto image the belly?
no, hydrate him. He may spiff up.
uh, four of morphine, antiemetics.
we'll get you out of here. Just sit tight.
okay, you're aboutto meet the Grassos.
she's been on dialys is since 2002.
he's got a kidney, but they don't match.
and our exchange pool paired them up with two cousins who are in exactly the same situation.
Yup. Kidneys for everyone.
Hi. You guys set?
you bet.
no more dialysis, no more infected shunts.
this is Dr. Rasgotra. She's going to be assistingon the transplant.
I am?
Ah, well, someone's about to getsome A-1 kidney meat.
I'm like a, I'm like a racehorse. I can drink a six-packwithout even peeg.
honey, gross.
actually, micturition capacity is related to bladder sizeand neural sensitivity, not renal function.
then, we'll give them some bladder, too.
okay, I'll see what I can do.
do you guys have any questions? Concerns?
no? Okay, I'll see you in the O. R.
our goal is to enroll 200 donor-recipient pairs.
by mixing and matching, we'd find kidneysfor almost 50% of them.
Yeah, I'll introduce you to the Herrero cousins. They're right on the hail.
so Marina's getting a kidney from one cousin and Thomas is giving his to the other.
Yep, kind of like a kidney key party. - Key party?
except the donorsand the recipients aren't allowed to meet. That could get a little messy.
it's the E. R. I'll catch up to you.
what's a key party?
Oh, it's a little gimmick to help swinging couples pick their partners.
forget it. Before your time.
sounds dirty.
Jessie, come on, hold still.
if he's got lice, you're cutting his hair. - I'm a doctor, not Vidal Sassoon.
Abby, I need you. Funny boy keeps throwing up.
okay, Ray, you got this, right? - Hey, n-n-no. Don't leave me here. Don't...
did you give him the reglan?
an hour ago. It should be working by now.
it's probably just gastroenteritis, and if your labs are okay, we'll get you home.
ugh... forget home.
I got a gig at 10: 15. The big room at Zanies.
I've been trying to get in there for a couple of years.
you're a comedian? - Aspiring.
you should aspirea little harder. - Ah, a heckler.
don't make me go K-K-Kramer on yo ass.
yo, blondie, need to get violent.
four of zofran. Repeat P.R.N.
Ah... geez. May I?
lay down, Simon.
Oh, my gosh.
I got to practice my routine.
I got to change my clothes.
I was going to wear this shirt, but now I got chow meinall over it.
we're tryingto get you better.
how long you beendoing stand-up?
moved out here from Detroita couple of years ago.
very courageous. Yeah, my old boss pushed meinto it.
cause you werefunny at work? - No.
cause he fired me twice, hated my guts.
my dad also had a lot to do with it.
he hated you, too? - No, he died.
life took ona whole new perspective.
all right, I'm gonna call the lab, try and see what's taking so long. Just relax.
I will try to relax.
I will.
we spent four weekse-mailing each other.
we finally meet and hesticks me with the bill?
so you chased after him and you fell into a hydrant?
I would have caught him, had I been wearing my flats.
all right, your breath sounds are perfect. Lay back for me, will you, please?
so what if I told him I look like Cindy Crawford?
he said he looked like Matt Damon. - Did he?
more like Matt Damon's fat uncle's ass.
pulse ox 98 on room air. - Tell me if this hurts.
Aah! Yeah. - All right...You havea broken rib.
I'm gonna give yousomething for the pain and, uh, we'll takean X ray, okay?
Percocet, CBC, and 2-view chest.
so you out of here, man? - Yeah, I guess so.
well, hopefully it'lljust be temporary, huh?
Yeah, that'll be too bad for you.
good luck, Dr. Pratt. - Yeah, thanks, Tiy.
Dr. Pratt. - Yeah.
you're gonna be okay. God is on your side.
Yeah, well, let's hope so.
okay, I could go with you. I just did the overnight. I'm almost off.
hope, go home, get some sleep, okay?
Dr. Pratt.
what are you doing here?
I'm going with you to your Medical Board hearing.
no, I'm okay, really, please.
hope, come pull the PICC linefor the guy in Two.
okay, I got to take this.
what about it, Greg?
the Church's support couldn't hurt.
you're still operating the clinic that got me into this mess.
look, I'm just tryingto better the community.
Yeah, what are you doing about black male incarceration?
next week.
okay, make sure you tell them how you and your program got me there.
Greg, I just want to help.
my license is suspended. I'm facing jail time.
I think you've helped enough.
so how'd it go with the counselor?
uh, wasn't what I expected, but nothing in my life ever is.
what did she say? - She, uh...
wants me to enroll Alexin an academy forat-risk youth.
which is a code wordfor "nut jobs."
my kid's not a nut job. He's just going through some stuff.
well, maybe it's some stuff that he can't handle.
I know about those places. They starve them and beat them. I can't...
send him there.
well, I could helpyou check some out, see if there's anythat might be okay.
thank you.
but I, uh...
need to do it alone.
I'm really sorry that I dragged you into everythinging the first place.
don't worry about it, Sam.
I...
I really like you.
but I have to focus on Alex rit now.
and I don't have time for any kind of a relationship.
all right. I get it.
you do? - I do.
your kid comes first.
so take as much time as you need.
is there any discomfort here? - No.
do you have a boyfriend?
uh, not exactly. We're still defining it.
a girl like you doesn't need the Internet.
I haven't had a Valentine since Jimmy Bachner in sixth grade.
Ouch! - She's into SM.
if you want her to stop, say "mayday." It's the safe word.
Mayday! Mayday!
there's no right upper quadrant tenderness; liver is fine.
let's observe her for two hours, check another CBC and follow serial exams.
Hey. Wait up.
you okay? - Yeah. You?
Yeah, yeah. Got home from Wisconsin yesterday.
how's Sarah holding up?
it's not gonna be easy. - I can imagine.
listen, I should've called. - Look...
go. I'm sorry. No, I should've called.
it's just, the funeral was awkward, - the relatives... - It's okay.
no, Neela... - I'm fine.
I'm sure you've gota lot on your plate.
I mean, you've probably got two plates and a little saucer.
Yeah, a heart-shaped saucer.
it's Valentine's Day Wednesday. Let's have a quiet dinner, huh?
Yeah, we'll see. - Hi, guys.
I-I've got surgery. - Neela...
she all right? - I don't know.
what about you?
Lockhart, your comic CBC is back, and it ain't funny.
white blood count 32,000 with 60% blas. - He has leukemia?
with all the immature white cells, he's anemic, neutropenic.
Oh, great.
offices 386 to 396-- > conference 399-- >
did you see the AMJ's article on integrative medicine?
you know the whole worldis falling apart when a study on Reiki makes it intothe Journal.
it's sexy, but the Dan-wouldn't touch it. The design istotally flawed.
um, excuse me. - Hi.
Hey.
are you Dr. Williams from Evanston?
uh, no, I'm Dr. Pratt from County.
take a seat.
I've isolated the artery. - All right, Neela, clip it.
you're letting hercut the artery?
she knows what she's doing. What are the pertinent anatomical relationships?
anterior to posterior, it goes renal pelvis, renal vein, - and then artery, which is clipped. - Good.
come on, any third-year medical student could have answered that question.
all right, what structures make up the cortex?
the what? - The cortex ofthe dney.
it's that bean-shaped thing you're cutting into.
you mean like the proximal tubules and the distal tubules?
and renal corpuscles. Medulla...
loop of Henle and...
your Valentine needsa surgical consult when you're done.
my Valentine? - Gates.
Oh, young love is so sweet. He's not smart enough for you.
you don't even know him. - Come on, Gates is easy math, Neela.
okay, that's enough. - Artery is ligated.
Dr. Dubenko, the donor kidney is prepped and ready to go.
excellent timing. Have them send it in.
how did Mr. Herrero do?
no complications, minimal blood loss. They're closing now.
that's great.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, where you going?
where you going? Is that where you dothe anal probe?
Sam, can you grab the zosyn?
I liked the other room. No need for an upgrade.
3. 375? - Yeah.
uh, Simon... - Yeah.
I need to talk to you about something important.
I can feelit, too.
I wasn't gonna say anything, but I do feel the sparks.
your blood tests show that you have leukemia.
thank God.
I thought you were gonna tell me I had cancer.
leukemia is cancer, of the white blood cells in the bone marrow.
that's great, that's great.
so just give me some Viagra, send me home, and we are all good!
this isn't funny.
I know.
okay, you're gonna needto go on I. V.antibiotics.
I know, I know, I know.
I got leukemia about a year ago.
I had induction emoand a bone marrow transplant.
and now, aearlater, it's back.
why can't cancer be like herpes?
I got that once, and it never came back.
herpes doesn't go away.

I mean, look at his cecum. There's wall thickening and distension.
Hey.
no, I told you you didn't have to go to school.
Yes, I'll come pick you up.
Hello? - Let me talk to your principal.
it's typhlitis.
Immuno-compromised hosts can get a cecal infection.
Yeah, her mom died. - Surgery?
treat with I. V.antibiotics, unless he perforates.
and then would you operate?
well, normally, given hisleukemia, I doubt he'd survive.
so... - So?
no, no, thanks for calling.
so nothing. No surgery for him.
okay, thanks.
Neela, I'm sorry. Sarah's having trouble at school. I got to pick her up.
okay. - I'll call you later, okay?
um...I'm gonna go and grab a coffee. Do you want anything?
Yeah, I'll tag along.
these people don't have insurance. They can't afford to see a doctor.
some can even buy medicine.
that's not the point.
I thought, with some guidance, the clinic could be a good thing.
why not send themto County Hospital?
have you ever been to County? - Trained there 20 years ago.
well, nowadays, we're filled with critical patients.
some people come infor a prescription refill, they wait up to 12 hours.
so this was about convenience? - This was about helping people.
there are programs for that. Yeah, you're right.
if you're over 65 or you have dependent kids.
regular folks withlow-paying jobs, they don't qualify.
this clinic took care of those people who fell through the cracks.
four O. R.s, fourpatients, four kidneys, all being worked on at the same time.
went like clock work. We were this fine-tuned machine.
I mean, this morning, two people were wasting away, waiting for a kidney that they thought would never come.
now, they're upstairs with their donors eating Jell-O, done with dialysis forever.
it's amazing, right? - That's pretty cool.
Yeah, that's what it's all about, you know?
that's why I became a surgeon.
Hey, Ray, you want to give us a hand? - I need to take this, okay?
I thought, what's a healthy 14-year-old doing with strokes?
I figured there's got to be more to the story.
so I went back to the parents, and, yes, uh, kid's adopted.
And? - Undiagnosed sickle beta thal.
kid didn't get screened at birth. - Wow.
nice pick up. - Thank you.
Oliver Miles, burned his hands trying to cremate his dead cat in the microwave.
I tried the fireplace, but I couldn't get it lit.
partial thickness tothe hands and forearms. Tachy at 120, BP 130 over 78.
pulse ox only 91.
okay, let's start him on five of albuterol by neb.
so I thought a crematoriumis just a big oven, right?
another four of IV morphine.
I don't know what he ate last, but it's like, he just exploded.
I got it, I got it.
do you know if-ifsomeone has my cat?
uh, ABG with carboxy-hemoglobin level, portable chest and 125 of solumedrol.
no problem. Trauma Two.
I'll be there in a second.
you okay? - I'm fine, Morris.
your hand's not. - No. This was just an accident.
go home. Rest. I promise, we'll be okay.
Hey, Luka, I didn't know you were back.
I'm not. How are you doing?
better now. - Take care, Gracie.
sure you don't want to wait till I get off?
I don't really feel like sending you home by yourself.
I'm not going home, Sammy.
I'm taking a-a little cruise. This way, you and Alex can bond.
we can bond with you here.
you need timeto sort through all this.
Oh, God, Grandma, the only thing I ever wanted to do was raise a good kid.
he got the crazy gene.
Oh thank god he skip the generation. You and I were both spared.
you think?
it's gonna beall right, Sammy.
he's going through a pase. It's rebellion, and then he'll come back around.
the good ones always do.
Yeah, well, what if he's not a good one?
he's yours, isn't he?
you're going with Timmy?
the Lidodeck awaits.
only old people take cruises alone.
Hey, Abby, which one do you like better?
thank you, folks. It was great to be here,
or just,"That's all folks. Now go home and beat the kids."?
Simon, you havean infectionin the cecum, where the small and large in testines join up.
maybe I'll just say,"Go home and beat the kids, but don't forget to tip the wait staff."
Yeah, listen, were you... Did you hear me-- what I said to you earlier?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I fe...I feel better.
I just need you to buff me up.
well, I can't, because youhave no immune system.
you can not fight this infection. - I don't need my immune system tonight.
I need my funny bone.
I spoke to your oncologist.
you're out of treatment options. You have a poo rprognostic karyotype.
11 Question 23 translocation. -Exactly.
and because the leukemia's recurred twice, you don't have anyoptions for chemotherapy.
okay, okay. Okay, so just...
put me in some trial.
make me a guinea pig.
I've always wanted to run on a big wheel and drink from a drip bottle.
there isn't any trial, and it's probably a matter of weeks, not months.
is there anyone you want me to call?
Yeah. A cab.
what are you doing?
I'm getting the hell out of here. - Look, you can't. Simon, you can't.
what do I have to lose, huh?
I don't want to walk on the moon, or bang Barbara Bush.
look...
I want to get on that stage and make an audience laugh.
you can't go! - I have to go!
have you ever wanted to do something that just...
scared the hell out of you, but you knew you had to do it?
well, this is it for me.
all right.
all right.
maybe a blood transfusion will give you some more energy. Come on.
I just need to be able to...
stand up.
or sit down.
maybe I could be a sit-down stand-up.
all right.
I'm gonna have to have you sign out against medical advice.
if I just took anyone's advice,
I'd still be checking taillights in Detroit right now.
and if anybody asks, this was not my idea.
how did you keep trac kof your patients?
I used five by seven cards for patient information.
and you have a complete H and P on a five by seven card?
well, we had limited records, just the important information.
Where'd you keep them?
in a box. - A box?
and if your patients had medical care other places, was there a system for other health professionals to access this box?
no, but they could havepaged me, I guess.
would you say your record system met the standards the Medical Board has set?
come on. We were in a church.
and did you log the drugs you dispensed? Did you record the numbers?
no, not fully. - Not at all. Isn't that right?
are you aware that this is a violation of the Medical Practice Act, Dr. Pratt?
I never claimed that this was a full-service medical center.
I didn't charge any money. I was just trying to help these people.
and do you think you helped Edgar Dixon when you prescribed him renumber?
GI bleeding is a commonside effect of NSAIDs.
the same thing could have happened to him if he had been prescribed the med anywhere.
but it didn't happen to him anywhere.
he went to you, and it killed him.
are you aware that diversion of narcotics is a felony, Dr. Pratt?
I didn't steal any narcotics...
you don't recall providing hydrocodone and ibuprofen to Ms. Nancy Campbell?
Mrs. Campbell had gallstones.
so you took a narcotic medication sample logged into the emergency department.
this is a felony punishable by imprisonment, Doctor.
Yeah, she was suffering. I-I wanted to help her.
I volunteer for a free clinic myself, and we follow the rules.
we keep accurate records, we dispense medication with proper safety pcautions, and we're there for our patients, Dr. Pratt.
you remember the part about doing no harm?
well, that applies to you, too, sir. - Excuse me, I'm sorry.
sir, we're in the middle of a meeting.
I'm Pastor William Watkinsat First Mission Baptist.
I'd like to speak on behalf of Dr. Pratt.
sorry they haven't taken you back to your room yet.
I just got a new kidney. I'm not gonna sweat the small stuff.
Oh. Hello.
happy Valentine's Day.
nothing says "I love you"like a bag of urine.
how's my donor do?
well, they're fine, but because of everybody's privacy, we're not really allowed to discuss it.
listen, this person saved my life.
I want to see him--or her-- just once, so I havea face to think of in my prayers.
how's it going?
okay, so the Democrats took over the House and the Senate.
how long before the Republicans jack up the rent and ect them?
that's pretty funny.
Oh, why aren't you laughing, then? - I am.
no, you're not.
Hemocue's up to11 after two units. - Antibiotics?
zosyn is in, Tobra's infusing.
I got to go pee-pee.
that's god. Your kidneys are working.
Hello! Hello! Quiet on the set. Thank you very much.
doc, I can't pee in bed.
I've been standing up since I was four.
pressure's been pretty good-- 101/68.
all right, get him a screen.
try to sit up and dangle your legs. - All right.
let us know if you're feeling dizzy.
I'm good, I'm good.
I got a little flop sweat, but then, that happens to the best of 'em.
someone's got to go with you.
I got a nervous blad and a neurotic sphincter.
seriously, it sucks.
I can't pee in public, and I'm afraid to fartin case I start a fire.
we'll wait on the other side.
it'll be a good test. - Of what?
the Emergency Broadcast System.
Oh, that is good!
Oh, man, this will work.
pee is funny.
Bedpans-- funny.
Catheter--not so funny.
maybe we can down grade to tele from ICU.
okay, I got him. Get him on the bed.
come on, one, two...three.
pressure's down-- 60/40. - Great. He's septic.
all right, ather two units of packed cells. - Start dopamineat ten mikes.
Simon, can you hear me? - Open your eyes.
come on, open your eyes! Can you hear me?
SATs are dropping. - All right.
put him on100% non-rebreather.
open an intubation kit. Come on, buddy!
come on, there's a spotlight on the curtains, and they're calling your name, Simon.
Hey, baby girl.
Dopaminet 12 mikes.
systolic's up to 110. - Good. Run in the fourth unit.
Hey.
am I on next?
how's it going? - What happened?
you tooka little nap. - Okay, little prick.
it's just cause it's cold in here.
all right, you got to keep that on, okay?
you know what? Sats are 100. Hey.
why don't we try a nasalcannula, five liters?
Abby, how about our deal? - Working on it.
what deal?
I thought we could try to buff him up so he could perform tonight.
he's septic.
his BP's dropped so low, he needs continuous I. V.pressors.
what the hell does that mean?
means you're not going anywhere tonight. - Can we talk outside? Please?
you do realize that you are asking me to break the mt central rule of this entire program?
it's adumb rule.
why is this so important to you? - Cause it's important to her.
part of him is gonna be part of me for the rest of my life.
Oh, come on, Manish.
okay, fine, but if Dubenko finds out... - Dr. Rasgotra, what are you doing?
we're just waiting on some labs.
what? Doesn't even make sense.
come on, man. Couldn't you do any better than"Waiting on labs"?
I'm not a doctor.
can I talk to you for a minute?
look, we're not supposed to do this... - Yeah...
but this guy saved her life, and she wanted to be able to see him in her prayers.
Yeah, n-n... - Dr. Crenshaw.
Dusty-- I mean, I know it's unethical, but it's nice, and sometimes, people like to do things for other people just to be nice.
have I mentioned how well you're coming along?
okay, we're good.
okay. Well, he's right over there.
which one is he? He's the one on the left.
your husband's kidney went into the other guy.
thank you. Thank you.
you know, Morris, it's his dream and he's going to die.
Yeah, and he's going to do it here and not on some comedy club floor.
his blood count is okay. He's had antibiotics.
his pressure is dopamine dependent.
well, what about intermittent pressors? - There isn't one.
epinephrine? - He can't leave here on a drip.
well I can give him six epi pens, 0.3 migs each.
he gives himself a shot once every 20 minutes...
are you out of your mind? - Why not try it?
no. No, I'm not doing it, no. - Then I'll find another attending.
I'm running the floor. - Then get some balls.
I've got balls.
well, they're no good unless you use them.
fine. Fine, you want to play Super Doctor? Great. Turn off the dopamine, give him epi and show me that his pressure can stay up for at least 20 minutes.
fine. - Fine.
nobody builds hospitals or clinicsin the inner city, because they know these people don't have any money.
they're leeches on the system.
so they...
they go out to the burbsand put up medical facilities on every corner like Starbucks, leaving us with a hospital that's over run, understaffed and underpaid.
there are free clinics.
most think they're for people with drug problems and sexually transmitted diseases.
we're talking about regular folk, here:
black and brown people who just need prescriptions.
Dr. Pratt knew the system was flawed and triedto help mend it.
I've got a whole congregation who'll attest to the fact that taking away this man's license would just be another demerit on a system that has already failed them.
the epi pen is spring loaded, so all you have to do is pressit against your thigh, and it fires off a shot.
sounds like my high school years.
can I use it during my act?
as long as you pull your pants down.
luckily, that's my big finish.
or should I say my average size finish.
all right, all right. Pressure's dropped again.
how long since his last epi? - Six minutes.
push point two, start dopaminemix up levophed.
damn it. - This was a dumb idea.
EPI has a one-minute half-life.
I have a body part with that same problem.
that was a good joke. - BP 89 over 64.
you know what the best thing about getting leukemia is?
hang another liter of saline and ait of packed cells.
everybody comes to see you.
the guys from the plant came.
my ex-soccer coach came.
even Father Dunlevy came.
it took three orderlies to get him out of the pedes ward.
that's a keeper.
you know, I was gonna kill tonight.
and instead, I'm dying.
SATs are dropping, 92 on five liters.
I would've left your name at the door, but...
something tells me I'm not gonna make it.
finish your act.
Hey. - Hey.
I, uh, brought you some food.
thank you. That was sweet of you. Come in.
thank you.
sorry I couldn't talk earlier. - Oh, it's okay. Forget it.
everything all right?
Yeah, I just, uh, came by to say "hi."
Hi. - Hi.
Sarah okay?
we're just sitting down watch a movie. Want to join us?
uh, no. I'm not gonna stay.
listen, can I... can I talk to you a second?
Yeah.
I've been wanting to tell you this.
remember the night when we were out there with Meg in the car?
and at one point...
she grabbed meand pulled me down to herand...
and she said,"Tony, Sarah's yours."
Sarah is yours.
is it possible?
it was 13 years ago, you know? We were messed up the three of us, high.
Keith would disappear for days and, you know, Meg and I...
it just happened, uh...
it wasn't a secret.
so you mean she could be your...
and that never occurred to you before?
well, I mean, I thought about it at first, but then...
years went by and I...
just believed what everyone else believed--that she was Keith's.
I should go.
Neela, that's who I used to be, it'sot who I am anymore.
no, it's okay. It's no big deal. Go watch your movie.
you know, you didn't have to do this.
well, you know that whole black male incarceration a bit got to me.
you'll be okay, Greg.
there are laws in this world that we have to follow, but then there are God's laws.
he'll have the last word of this, just you watch.
Hey. - Hey.
what are you doing here?
look, you covered for me, the least I can do is support you.
all right. Come on, sit down.
Dr. Pratt, the Board finds that you have violated the Medical Practice Act and believes that these transgressions are adequate justification to suspend your medical license.
however, in light of your attempt to help your community, we have decided to put you on probation for one year.
your practice will be monitored. You will need to perform 100 hours of community service.
perhaps finding a wayto legalize a certain church-based clinic would bea good use of your time.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
Dr. Pratt!
Hey. How did I do?
you brought the house down.
thank you...
for being such a great audience.
Hey, you. - Hey.
I decided to put our CDs on the iPod.
we don't need allthese anymore. - I need to talk.
is everything okay?
um, you know, when you were on the roof, I was thinking about what...
what I would do if Joe didn't have a father, and, um, if we didn't have each other.
and I realized that if we could get through this, we could probably get through anything.
what's going on?
I mean, have you ever wanted something so much, but...
it scared the hell out of you?
see, here's the thing, I just...
well, I changed my mind and I was wondering if you could ask me again.
what?
ask me again.
ask me to marry you.
I don't know if today you arrived a bit early or a bit late...
it started to rain and we were unable to film.
where are you going?
I'm leaving you, Ernesto.
shouldn't we talk about this before?
I've already told you everything I had to.
Lena, please! Please, Lena!
good bye...
Lena, listen to me, Lena!
let me go!
turn around, my love. I'll help you. Let me do it.
don't worry, relax, I'll help you.
you could have broken something. I'll remove your shoes.
you'll be more comfortable that way.
I'll take care of everything. Cheer up. Help me.
my love, careful...
sit down, carefully... treasure.
like that... good... I'll take you to hospital in a second.
my wife fell down the stairs! Very carefully, please.
let's see...
careful.
the head...
relax, relax.
careful... Careful with the legs.
we'll take her to trauma.
may I use the phone?
not here, in the doctor's office.
it's rather urgent.
don't worry. We'll take her to the consultation room in a second.
Mateo?
Yes. What's the matter? Are you not coming?
no, not tonight no.
is everything OK?
there has been an accident. But don't worry, everything is fine.
we've got afternoon filming tomorrow. Shal we see each other first before?
no, I won't be able to. I've got plenty of stuff to do. I'll see you directly in the sutiod.
you sound weird, Magdalena. Are you sure everything is all right?
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow.
well, they're here. Don't ask anything, ok?
are you OK, madam?
I'm fine.
can I help you?
it's not necesary, thanks.
it hasn't been anything.
Martin, please. Open the door.
thanks for your discretion.
could you please remove your glasses?
what do you want me to do? What can I do for you to forgive me?
take me to the studio.
you shouldn't move.
if you don't take me, I'll go. Even if I have to crawl. Aunque sea a rastras.
what are you going to say? How are you going to explain the leg and the plaster and scratches?
depends on you.
on me?
I'll do whatever you ask me, if you promise to stay with you.
I will stay with you if you let Mateo finish the filming, according to whatever he decides.
he will start asking questions, he's not an idiot.
I'll say I tripped.
how are you going to film, if you can't walk?
he will decide that, but I want to make sure that you will respect his decision, no matter the cost, or the waiting time. Is that clear?
I live there.
and that's it. Ernesto is ready to agree to whatever you decide.
decide, what?
I can't go from a shot of you walking normal to one in which you go in a plaster!
how long do you have to wear the plaster?
three weeks.
do you mind if I speak a second with Lena on our own?
tell me the truth!
people don't fall off the stairs, that only happens in the movies.
be quiet, Mateo.
we need to finish the filming as soon as possible. Until then I won't be able to dump Ernesto.
why not? He's a psychopath! What other proof do you need?
my god!
I can't go. I've promised I'd stay with him in exchange that you finish the movie with the conditions that you decide.
no. There must be another solution.
which one? The only one is that I keep living with him until you finish!
what have you compromised to, exactly?
to live under the same roof, he in his own bedroom, and I in mine.
he has no right to anything else.
do you think he's going to abide only to that?
I don't know, but the sooner we finish filming, the better. Make up something to avoid stopping!
we only have got one stair scene
we would have to repeat the ending...
23 retake, one, first.
action!
so you are Ivan's ex wife?
the one that has been in a physichiatric ward for the last 20 years?
Yes, but I'm not in any ward anymore.
now I'm here with you... walking down the stairs...
according to the note, it seems that you are in a hurry to see him.
Yes, but you walk first...
no, the one in a hurry is you. I've been waiting for 20 years.
come on...
as I was telling you... After breaking appart with my husband
I went to the street and I found a guy that was looking at me, very good looking.
what an arse, feet... Well, I brought him home and I fucked him several times.
you know I'm very interested in sex as a social matter.
and how was it?
in bed, godly, a virtuous. Haven't seen anything like that.
this is the good one.
what a big toe!
every morning, Lena arrived destroyed to the filming.
based on repetition, there was always a shot in which she overcame it and managed to do it good.
the convivence with Martel had become hell.
Lena didn't tell me anything, but it was obvious.
when the filming had finished, I asked him to drop it, but she was afraid for the movie.
she didn't want to leave him, not until I had chosen all the good shots.
Hello?
it's Magdalena.
is everything ok, Magdalena?
no. I'm down here, and I've forgotten the money. I have to pay the taxi...
I'm on my way. Be right back.
she is in the toilet.
but..., but what has happened?
we've had a big fight.
finally, he ripped my clothes off and he threw me to the street half naked.
give the driver a tip, he has lended me his jacket. If it wasn't for him...
son of a bitch! Right now we're going to tell the police!
no, Mateo! Take me far away from here, please.
Yes, yes, yes, of course. As you wish.
give me the camera.
what are you writing?
el secreto de la Playa del Golfo" . when I took the picture I hadn't seen the couple kissing.
and what is their secret?
I don't know, I need to write it to figure out.
that couple is us...
what is it? It looks like a leg.
it's an arm! And the wto legs!
without noticing, a month had already passed.
I knew that, sooner or later, we would have to go back, but we were postponing it.
I was only worried about mum and you. I hadn't even said goodbye to you, and you were with your allergies when we left
OK. The man with the bleach is here. Do we need bleach? No? Ok. Over.
Hi, sorry to interrupt... I just wanted to ask if you have any possiblilities for work with you here.
well, we could use the help, especially now that the high season is about to start.
have you got any experience?
Yes, I have worked as a secretary in Madrid. I am quite bilingual.
she could start working here in the afternoons... and then we could see.
wonderful!
excuse me, excuse me. We were just saying that the girl in the ad looks exactly like you.
no. It's not me.
I was wondering how long it would take to appear!
but they can't do the premiere so soon, can they?
no, I did it to annoy us, it's a trap for you to come back.
the advertisment only needs a label that reads "Wanted
so what are we going to do?
nothing. Fuck him.
what?
the only intelligent thing we've done is not to go to the premiere...
bastards!
Judit, it is I. I need to talk urgently to you.
call me, please! This is my number... 845132
sorry... 28845132. Ah, and ask for Harry Caine, I've given that name here.
are you there? I await your call!
and mum didn't answer?
no.
Why?
because she was upset, I guess.
but even if she was really angry, she should have told you what was happening.
Yeah, the matter is that she didn't, and we've never spoken about it.
and weren't you curious?
me? I was dying f curiosity!
for two days I had been calling your mother and Luis, the mounter, but nobody answered.
so I decided to go back to Madrid and see with my own eyes what was happening.
it's the first time we split.
anyway, I'll be back on the weekend.
but if you are going to stay here worried, come with me.
no, I'm better off here. Madrid scares me.
Magdalena's death didn't surprise us hugging each other, as we'd dreamed, but in separate seats.
I was even surprised, leaving me alive.
Mateo... Mateo, tell me something.
Mateo is dead, Judit.
don't say that...
we call him with his name, but he refuses to answer. Insists that Mateo is dead.
the pictures are the basis of his work.
living in darkness, I guess was like death for him. Is there any possibility that he sees again?
none. His is what we call cortical blindness, and cannot be cured.
that is, very good, very good...
there are some stairs on the right side.
but it's not here, we have to go a bit further.
come on, I'll guide you until we get to the border
come on, that is... very good... We're almost there.
now there are some steps until we get to the car and we're going to walk them slowly because they are very high.
they are 25cm , I measured them before. Wait, i'll leave you the bag.
come on, let's go...
the first one is the hardest but I'll hold you.
that is, slide your feet. You're there. Let's go.
very good...
come on, now the second. That's it...
a bit more. There, that's it. No more steps.
did you go to see Lena's mother in town?
Yes.
what did she say?
she was very pleased with Ernesto for having taken care of everything.
is he there?
Yes. She was buried with his father.
did you see the tomb?
Yes.
how was it?
simple. The mother told me that they didn't want luxuries.
look, mum, the sea!
we're in "Famara."
please, stop! I'm getting off here.
no, wait a second. How are you going to get off here?
you go to the reception and do whatever you have to do. I'll wait for you in the beach.
I want to get off here, too!
but how are you going to get off with this strong wind?
I'm not bothered by the wind.
shut up, Diego, shut up!
stop the car, please.
mum, please. Let me stay, it's the first time I've seen the sea, please...
well, well..., all right. But be careful.
and don't get too close to the sea.
give him your hand and don't let go, please. Be careful with the wind, too. Oh, my god! That's it.
careful, there's a step!
please, let's go.
wait here, please.
good morning... Good morning.
good morning. Good morning.
I am here to pay the Mateo Blanco's bill, please.
who?
Mateo Blanco.
we dont have anyone here registered by that name, right?
its the man who had the accident.
you mean Harry Caine?
yes... of course...
Harry! Harry Caine!
we're here, Judit!
we have to go, Harry.
let's go, Dieguito. Dieguito, give me your hand.
can't we stay here for a while longer?
no, you've had enough wind for today.
I'm here... Harry.
careful, don't trip over.
do you remember "Famara," Diego?
perfectly.
it was the first time I saw the sea. I remember the kytes and a dog barking.
I remember that dog barking as well...
what are you doing?
I'm trying to reconstruct your pictures...
I have almost one complete...
what do you want to do to cheer you up a bit?
I'd like to hear Jeanne Moreau's voice.
well I don't have the phone.
search "Ascensor para el cadalso" by Louis Malle.
OK. Fritz Lang, Jules Dassin, Nicholas Ray...
search on the top.
Fanny and Alexander," "Fellini Eight and a half," "Obsession..."
Ascensor para el cadalso," I've got it here. I haven't seen it.
I hope you like it.
are you crazy? How am I going to throw it away?
what I have to do is to make the police find it in my house.
leave that! That is "Chicas y maletas"!
but I don't understand...
well that's pretty clear.
if the police finds in my place 15 kilos of uncut coke, I could get arrested.
Yes, but I don't understand how that suitcase has appeared in your home, like that...
sounds strange, doesn't it?
as I was telling you..., after breaking appart with my husband I went to the street,
and I saw that guy who was glncing at me, very good looking.
what an ass, and his feet... I brought home and I fucked him several times.
they are totally out of tune...
in bed, a virtuous.
look at my goosebumps...
how could I take those shots as good? They are both horrible!
what do you want to to today?
I have to go home. My mother has left a message saying that she's back today, ready to celebrate your birthday.
is it my birthday?
so she says.
if Judit says so...
congratulations, man!
so, I will have to invite you for supper.
is there anybody at home?
Yes.
Oh, my son, I wanted to see you so much!
what happens? Is it very noticeable?
well, yes.
I haven't even had time to wipe my ass, today.
well, don't look at me like that... I thought you had already gotten used to.
Yes, sorry...
you are beautiful, very beautiful. Are you ok? You had me very worried.
I'm fine. Mateo has taken care of me day and night...
Mateo? Isn't your name Harry anymore?
yes...
we have to buy him a birthday present.
well..., what have you been doing all this time?
nothing... watch movies... and talk.
talk?
Yes.
what about?
my God, mum!
well..., what did you have?
I don't know if I should believe the gastroenteritis... you used it already as an excuse in a script...
I had... an accident. But I'd rather not talk about it now.
an accident? What sort of accident?
it's hard to explain.
try it! I'm not THAT stupid!
we'll leave it for another time, ok? I'm fine now.
well, I'm going to buy some DVDs to Mateo.
we're closing.
I know, this is the last one.
Thanks.
thank you.
I don't know what have you been talking all these days...
but I know what I haven't told you all these years.
I've never asked you...
but you might have wondered it yourself thousands of times.
this is my bithday present, Mateo.
the present is also for you, Diego.
after your vanishing, Ernesto Sr. only wanted vengeance...
drop it, Judit.
no.
you've had a bad day today.
that's why, I'd like to finish it a bit better.
Ernesto had a delusional plan to take vengeance on you, but to perform it he had to bribe us, at least, Luis, the mounter, and me.
despite the delusional bit, there was no problem, we sold ourselves without any resistance. Luis and I.
with me, well, he gave me an alibi, he proposed me to go a month and a half to the U. S. that way, I wouldn't be there whist he... ruined your movie.
because that was his plan, to reduce your movie to dust.
I prefered to stay in Madrid and cure Diego here. I wanted to witness everything.
if I was going to betray you, I wanted to pay the price for it.
it was a torture to see how Ernesto was choosing the worst takes of each shot and Luis was mounting them, transforming your movie in a monster.
the only way to resist all of that was to suffer more.
I sold myself to Ernesto for pain and jealousy! I didn't accept it, and I didn't forgave you for abandoning "Cinearte" with Lena without a single word.
with my treason, I took vengeance upon you, her, and myself... The only innocent was Diego.
sorry, son, for all the bitterness I've given you all this years.
nobody deserves to grow like that...
may I have another G&T, please?
don't look at me like that.
thank you.
please, Judit, don't continue. There is no need.
Yes. Now that your name is Mateo again I have no excuse anymore.
you have told us everything.
no... not everything.
nobody knew where you were. We had no idea.
Ernesto prepared everything, the premiere, all that, so you reacted.
his vengeance had no meaning if neither of you took notice.
Ernesto was asking me constantly about your whereabouts, but I knew nothing, either, which was true.
I didn't want to call you for that, to avoid making your life more difficult.
Ernesto hired some detectives to find you.
but, before they found you, you phoned me, two days after the premiere.
I was too shocked to answer your call.
I still am.
when ernesto asked about you again, I don't know why, I gave the phone to "Famara."
Ernesto sent his son to find you to Lanzarote.
it was Ernesto Jr the one who found you after the accident and phoned the hospital...
did he had anything to do with the accident?
No! But I can't stop thinking that should I hadn't given the phone number to his father...
maybe nothing would have happened...
why do you think that?
I don't know... bad conscience, I guess.
well it's enough, then! 14 years of bad conscience are enough!
wait, I'll help you.
no, thanks. Good night.
call if you need anything!
Diego. Not answering. Leave your message
hi Diego, is Mateo...
I'm sorry about calling you so early. Tell your mother to call me as soon as she can. Thanks.
Harry, so early. How comes?
I couldn't sleep.
Oh... Coffee and toast?
Yes, but before, Would you mind calling me at this number?
ray X?
here...
Thanks.
I'll bring you the coffee.
Ernesto?
who is this?
I'm sorry to bother you, I'm Mateo Blanco.
what nonsense!
one has to start the day with the good foot.
how are you feeling?
a bit hangover, but fine. I think that yesterday's catharsis, in the end, felt great.
come on, let me help you.
no, sit down, sit down...
Diego, I only needed to tell you something else.
you'll tell me later. Let's have breakfast now.
if I don't tell you now, maybe I won't ever tell you...
at the end of the 80's, Mateo and I had an affaire.
but I imagined that already, even before yesterday's catharsis.
did you?
mum, it's obvious!
the same curtains in his bedroom than in yours, memorabilia from Mexico and the Caribbean in both homes, the crosses...
of course... There's something else that I don't think you know.
Mateo is your father.
Mateo, my dad?
Yes.
and your lover who went, my supposed biological father, you made it up?
no... I can't hide things, but I never make anything up. I can't invent.
the lover existed. We had an adventure. He was gay, and the adventure lasted little.
does Mateo know?
no. Are you crazy! In that time, he asked me, and I, of course, negated it.
I didn't press him, I didn't want our relationship to change because of that.
in the end, I didn't ask him either if he wanted to be your dad.
ha! Bastard! So Mateo is my father...
by the way, he phoned early this morning.
Mateo? What did he want?
he wanted you to call him as soon as you could.
why didn't you wake me up?
because after yesterday you needed some sleep, and he didn't say it was urgent.
you can call him now.
come on, give me the phone.
Hello?
Hi. Diego told me to call you. Are you OK? Do you need anything?
I'm not fine, Judit. And yes, I need something...
the 40. 000 metres of negative that we recorded on my last movie to mount it.
I'm at Ernesto Jr's home and I have just been told that the material was destroyed in 1994.
I imagined something like that, but I didn't think they would do it so soon.
what are you doing at Ernesto's?
I think I'm going to blackmail him. We need money and he has plenty.
I don't want Diego to go back to that damned bar, I want to pay him a salary.
Mateo, don't be crazy!
I can't figure out anyone else to blame for Magdalena's death.
my god! Wait, I have something to tell you!
leave it, you said enough yesterday.
listen, Mateo! I was the production director of the movie, the only person who had access to the lab and the material.
after Ernesto gave the order for it to be destroyed, I intercepted it and kept it.
I have everything at home.
you're lying.
I didn't tell you yesterday because I didn't know that you wanted to mount it again.
I kept it. All the double shots, the negative, the sound tracks, everything!
you can have everything whenever you want! That changes everything.
that changes everything.
get out of there, Mateo, and leave Ernesto alone. He has nothing to do with this.
he still has to tell me what he was doing in Lanzarote. Goodbye, Judit. I'll call you later.
Ernesto and his camera... You remind me of a Peeping Tom.
Yes, but I never wanted to kill you.
I'm not so sure about that.
I have here a copy of the "making of" that proves it.
why do I want that? I can't watch it!
someone you trust should watch it and tell you. Sorry...
with this pictures the documentary about Mateo Blanco ends, also called Harry Caine...
what do you think of the documentary, how should I name it, Ernesto?
very interesting.
what do you see now?
the last night, when you're on your way back from the restaurant.
how was he able to film us? The night was very dark...
his car's lights and the lighting from the statue were enough to see what happened. Anyway, he has touched digitally the picture.
Mateo, Ernesto not only did not provoke the accident, but he was also the first person who came to help you.
how was he able to film and drive at the same time?
I don't know...
is there anything else that I need to know? What are you seeing now?
you are waiting in the roundabout for a car to go through the left. Lena and you kiss...
a kiss? I don't remember...
it's a normal kiss, one of those that couples give by inertia.
the last kiss...
yes... Lena didn't die in your arms, as you two had dreamed, but the last feeling she had in this world, was the flavour of your mouth...
is it there?
Yes.
play it frame by frame, so it lasts longer...
14 years after the filming, I was finally able to mount "Girls and luggage."
on my way! Ah, it's you.
I've left thousands of notes!
Yes, a thousand yours, and none from Ivan.
and that case!
it's Ivan's. I'm borowing it.
and the crutches?
his ex wife, the bitch. She pushed me down the stairs.
wow, what a pair of us! I've splitted also with my husband.
Oh, I'm sorry. Listen, I was doing coffee, would you mind to serve it?
no.
I've spent the whole night searching for Ivan, and I've had a pic session afterwards and I've had no sleep yet.
neither have I!
Hey, when did you split?
four days ago. Sugar?
no.
I foresaw it. Thing is that, after splitting,
I go out to the street and I discover that guy looking at me.
Oh, gazpacho! I'm going to serve myself a glass.
No!
I've put a whole box of sleeping pills in there.
why so?
just in case Ivan came, he likes gazpacho a lot.
my dear, Pina!
that's nothing! Since he wasn't calling, I've ripped the phone off the wall.
I've stumbled upon it, and I haven't asked anything because I didn't want to ask too much...
but... that bed? It's smoking, isn't it?
the match fell, and started burning, and I didn't want to put it off. Fire purifies.
bring your coffee!
you were telling me something, Chon?
Ah, yes..., yes!
I was telling you... I also have a case at home.
your husband's?
no.
a case with 15 kilos of coke, uncut..., delicious...
are you now a drug dealer, Chon?
I'm still chancellor of Social Services. The case appeared in my wardrobe, suddently.
I have to dispose of those 15 kilos as soon as possible.
with the time schedule we have in politics, we take plenty of drugs.
between the members of the party and in the Council, I could deliver up to 2 kilos,
but what do I do with the rest?!
throw it away!
are you mad! How am I going to throw it away?
what I need to do is avoid the police finding it at home...
but, I don't know how...
well it's very clear to me!
if the police catches me with 15 kilos of uncut, delicious coke at home, they could get me arrested.
Yeah, Chon, but I don't understand how that case appeared in your wardrobe, like that, suddently!
as I was telling you... After splitting with my husband,
I went outside, and I met a guy who was staring at me. Good looking.
what an arse, feet... Well, I brought him home and I fucked him several times.
you know that I'm very interested in sex, as a social matter...
and how was he?
in ved? A virtuoso.
I've never seen anything like that! Look at my goosebumps!
so what happened afterwards?
nothing, after fucking he asked me if he could stay some days in my place.
do you have magdalenas?
Yes, there, up in the cabinet.
and I have a lovely flan.
I'll eat that afterwards!
so, he asked me if he could stay at home.
I said well, but I couldn't promise anything.
I didn't want him to think that I was an easy woman.
thing is, he appeared at home with a case and installed himself there.
I was yesterday evening watching TV...
and I learned that the police has caught him in an anti-drugs raid and that he's one of the most wanted drug dealers of the country!
no way!
with the tingling nose, I open the case and I see that it's full of cocaine bags.
what a story, my God!
it was strange that he fucked so good!
for men who live in that sort of risky life, every fuck is like the last one.
and, of course, there's no colour! Look at my goosebumps!
I saw it before... You have it so easy! And the case?
the case... well, I wanted to ask you... if you don't mind me bringing it here.
can you hear me?
Yes, I can hear you.
I'm going to bring it here. If it's found in my place, it's not because of what could happen to me, which is not the ideal thing for a Social chancellor, but do you imagine the shock to the Mayor and my party?
my party can't bear any more scandals!
don't shout, Chon!
the police!
SSH! How is it going to be the police? Nobody knows you're here.
I'm a very noticeable woman, Pina, since I was a girl...
look like you only came for coffee.
this is like what we have defined.
do you think I should keep mounting it, or is it madness?
what? I was laughing my ass off! I'm dying to know how it ends!
it's wonderful, Mateo!
is hilarious. We should do the premiere again.
no, the important thing is to finish it.
movies have to be finished, even blindfolded...
come on, you Iazy Kaffirs. Come on.
keep in Iine, man. Keep in Iine.
what are you Iooking at me Iike that for, you fuck?
what are you Iooking at? I'II fuck you up!
move!
you men make sure that's tied down properIy, you hear me?
carefuI, man!
pa, why is it taking so Iong?
go back to your mother.
move your feet, move your feet, come on!
I said, go back!
move!
sergeant Gregory,
dannie Bosman, the oId skipper for the crossing.
your first time to Robben IsIand?
I hear the fishing is exceIIent.
you'II get bored with that soon enough.
what prison are you from?
Kroonstad Maximum Security.
weII, Robben IsIand is a totaIIy different baII game.
aII prisoners beIow deck and secured, Captain.
ladies and chiIdren, aII aboard pIease!
Where's your mom?- Busy putting on her Iipstick.
we can board now, sweetie.
how do I Iook?- You Iook great.
as Iong as I don't get seasick.- It's onIy an hour.
wiII I be abIe to get my own bedroom, Pa?
of course you wiII.
I don't want to share with Natasha again.
who said I want to share with you?
you two stop fighting and behave yourseIves.
remember, first impressions are everything.
are aII the prisoners on the isIand bIack, Ma?
aII of them. But at Kroonstad, they were white.
now, we don't mix whites and bIacks, not even in the prisons.
these are not just criminaIs, Brent. These are terrorists.
but what's the difference?
terrorists are terribIe peopIe.
they want to kiII aII the whites and take our Iand away from us.
which is why we Iock them up on the isIand.
sergeant Gregory.
captain Devett, the personneI officer on the isIand.
how do you do, Captain? I'm GIoria...
I have a jeep standing by.
this way. Your furniture wiII foIIow.
one, two.
aII aboard, Captain.
this is it.
you can stand down for today, Sergeant.
this evening you're expected to attend an officer's braai at the OC's residence.
missus incIuded. FuII dress uniform.
gioria, I can't find my stepouts.
ma is visiting next door, Pa.
why the toiIet outside, Pa?
these houses are oId, boet. They were buiIt during the war.
what war?- Second WorId War.
but what happens if I need to go at night?- Then you'II go.
but there are bad peopIe out there.
boy, the onIy bad peopIe on this isIand are Iocked up in jaiI, okay?
okay, Pa.
James, are you decent?
Yeah, why?
excuse aII the boxes, but you know how it is.
this is my husband, James.
how do you do?- How do you do?
Sannie's kindIy offered to babysit for us.
Oh, that's very nice.
weII, Sannie's husband is head chef here.
so, if you ever need anything, eggs, fIour, sugar, you know who to ask.
just don't say where it came from.
I can't find my stepouts.
under the bed. I poIished them.
and you, James, what's your posting? He doesn't know yet.
we'II probabIy find out this evening.
he must be something speciaI, 'cause the NCOs are never invited to the CoIoneI's house.
not unIess they are in deep troubIe.
Serious?- We don't mix.
officers here are aII bIoody snobs.
I've got dinner on the stove.
give me a shout when you're ready to go, GIoria.
aII right. Thanks, Sannie.
weII, I'm starting to get a bit nervous now.
you get in with the officers and they'II nominate you for a commission.
you have to be a warrant officer first, GIoria.
this is not Worcester, James.
this is not Kroonstad.
this is Robben IsIand, the number one prison in the country.
you pIay your cards right and who knows, in five years you couId be at head office in Pretoria.
dream on.
I think I'm going to give you a quick IittIe haircut before we go.
Christ, woman, you never stop.
Oh, come on. Never.
you don't have to wait to go to the mainIand.
I'm a fuIIy quaIified hairdresser.
ReaIIy?- And I'm good.
HighIights is what you need.
a bit of fIair, then you'II see the heads turning.
weII, are we going to keep you busy, or what?
this is no hoIiday camp, Sergeant.
you got warders stuck out here for two weeks at a time.
it's a recipe for aIcohoI abuse, for prostitution...
prostitution?
we've got married NCOs pimping their wives out to singIe warders to suppIementing their shitty saIaries.
I hope Captain Devett is not painting too bad a picture of us.
weIcome to the isIand, Gregory.
it's an honor to be here, sir.
I see our wives are aIready making friends.
thank you for inviting us, sir.
there's someone who wants to meet you. Excuse us, Captain.
this is Major Piet Jordaan, from the Bureau of State Security.
I beIieve you speak the Kaffir Ianguages, Sergeant.
I speak Xhosa, sir.- Where did you Iearn the Ianguage?
I grew up on a cattIe farm in Transkei.
when you've got no brothers to pIay with, you end up pIaying with the Kaffirs, sir.
shaII we take a waIk, Sergeant?
so, what do you think of the judgment handed down in MandeIa's triaI?
in my opinion, he shouId have got the rope, sir.
Oh, then we couId have turned him into a martyr.
perhaps he's more use to us behind bars.
that's a waste of taxpayers' money, is what I say. They aII are.
aII bIacks?
certainIy the ones who took up arms against us. The communists.
mandeia denies he's a communist.
weII, they're aII Iiars, aren't they?
you know, in the 1800s, this whoIe isIand was a Ieper coIony.
nothing's reaIIy changed then.
how do you feeI about heading up the censorship office in Bsection?
excuse my ignorance, sir, but what is Bsection?
that's where we keep MandeIa and aII his mates.
I need someone on the inside, someone who speaks their Ianguage.
I want to know what they think, how they think.
anything you find odd in their Ietters or their visits, you report directIy back to me.
I want you to be my window into their souI, if they have a souI.
and here I was thinking
I was going to spend my first year working bIoody nightshifts.
you can if you want.- No. PIease, no, sir.
it wouId be an honor for me to run the censorship office.
I won't Iet you down.
you Iet me down, you Iet your country down.
I wouId never do such a thing. Of course not.
weII, I don't know about you, but I'm bIoody starving.
let's go and get something to eat.
they asIeep? FinaIIy.
too much bIoody excitement.
the CoIoneI's wife, Joyce, is coming over tomorrow for a cut.
she bakes so she'II pay with a cake.
and Hettie, you know that nice captain's wife?
her husband dives for crayfish so that's how she'II pay. And that woman with the gray hair...
gioria. What?
they're putting me with MandeIa and SisuIu and them.
no.
they want me in charge of the censorship office.
my God, James, why didn't you say something?
wasn't going to bIow my trumpet in front of aII those bIoody officers.
this is big, my boy. MandeIa.
never mind that, I report directIy to Pretoria.
this is fantastic. Did they say anything about a promotion?
in due course, I was toId.
no more discipIine order for me.
from now on,
I'm in charge of the worst terrorist this country's ever seen.
do you know how many bridges he's bIown up?
do you know how many poIice stations he and his Umkhonto we Sizwe have bombed?
didn't I say this was going to be our isIand in the sun? Didn't I say that, James?
you sure did, Booky.
put your backs into it, you Iazy Kaffirs!
get up, you sIack bastards!
three days off rations for insubordination.
attention!
I'm your new censorship officer!
if you want to post a Ietter, you do it through me!
one Ietter every six months, no Ionger than 500 words.
no reference to other prisoners, no mention of prison conditions.
and no bIoody poIitics.
if you faiI to adhere to these reguIations, your Ietters wiII not be posted.
if you receive a Ietter, it comes through me.
same story. One every six months.
any mention of poIitics and that Ietter wiII be censored.
is that cIear?
you fuck with me and
I'II make your Iife a Iot more miserabIe than it aIready is.
and I'II enjoy doing so.
which one is MandeIa?
he's in soIitary.
five days for taIking in the passage.
right! Back to work!
let's see you breaking some rocks!

VosIoo, escort the prisoner back to his ceII. FoIIow me.

no, I want to see it.- Me, too.
didn't know you were a farm boy, James.
I'm not a farm boy.-Here it is. Look.
Oh, cute. Look at the IittIe Kaffir Iover.
I'm not a Kaffir Iover!
he's even got his arm around the IittIe nigger.
that's it. Looks Iike a KaffirIover to me!
I'm going fishing. Brent, get your rod!
look, Pa, a starfish.
that's nice, Natasha.- Pa, I've got one.
Hey, bring him through the rocks there. Nice and sIow, that's it.
Hey, don't Iook at me, man.
don't Iook at me. I'm not your bIoody mother, man.
give me that, Brent. Come here. Move it! Bastard!
Natasha, come here, girI.
stay down. Stay there.
pa, what about my fish?- Never mind your fish.
faster, faster, faster! Come, come, come!
are you trying to piss me off?
get down, boy!- But, Pa...
move it, you Iazy bastards.
aII right then, we can go back now. Come on. Okay?
move it!
but what about my fish?
I'm sorry, boy, but if those warders had seen you,
I'd be in big troubIe.
why?- Prisoners aren't aIIowed to see chiIdren.
why not?
because they are here for punishment.
okay?
this is from Motsadi's wife.
'we have decided to boycott the bus service as they have increased the fare by 80 cents. "
cut it out.
James. The following, please collect your letters.
SisuIu.
MhIaba.
Kathadra, hurry up. Do you think I've got aII day?
Motsadi! Jonas Motsadi! Where's Motsadi?
the rest of you are dismissed.
Mr. Gregory, I found this in my ceII.
according to reguIations, no prisoner may be in possession of any newspaper or part thereof.
therefore, I am handing it over to you, the proper authority.
I am surprised that you did not Iook at the articIe, Mr. Gregory.
come on! Come on! That's it. Yes, go, Robben IsIand.
Yes!
Yes! Yes!
he's reaIIy got something, hey, darIing? Very good.
Gregory, for a postman, you pIay a damn good game of rugby.
robben IsIand! Robben IsIand.
I think it's time I had a word with Piet about James.
he's officer materiaI, there's no question about it.
Oh, Joyce. I'II do your hair for free for the rest of your Iife.
then I'm definiteIy going to taIk with Piet.
off to Cape Town for the weekend?
Yeah, my mom's been dying to see the kids.
it's been ages.
then I'm going to give you a IittIe shopping Iist with a good mayonnaise at the top.
I can't stand this prison issue stuff.
granny! Granny!
HeIIo, my darIings!
these are for you. I found them on the beach.
Oh, they're beautifuI.- Hi, Mom.
how was the ferry?- Fine. The sea was fIat for a change.
Oh, good.
I got you some fresh crayfish, Barbara.
Oh!
never mind fresh, they're aIive!
weII, seeing as you didn't get seasick, we can go shopping.
NeIson MandeIa. That's awfuI.
Yeah, it's a big responsibiIity.
James gets to check their maiI and monitors aII their visits.
that's restricted information, GIoria.
Oh, for goodness sake, Mom's not going to teII anyone.
gioria, come heIp me choose some saIad stuff quickIy.
I'II wait outside with the kids. Come here.
the two of you, stand stiII.
passport. Where's your passport? Let me see your passports.
Where's your passport?- Your pass.
you have no pass. Come, come, come.
what's going on, Pa?
passports. Where is your pass?
they are checking for passes.
come back here. Where's your pass? No! No!
come back, come back.
Hey, freeze, Kaffir.
I need some heIp over here.
get in the van!
you can't just Ieave the baby here!
I'II take him. He's my daughter's chiId.
it's aII right. It's aII right. It's aII right. It's okay.
maybe you shouId go taIk to her.
another minute and these'II be done, okay?
feeIing better?
dinner's aImost ready.
why didn't you stop that poIiceman?
because that's his job.
to take the mommy away from the baby?
no, but if the mommy doesn't have a pass, then she's not aIIowed to be there.
so they had to arrest her.
do we have a pass?
we don't need one.- Why not?
because we're white.
but is that fair, Pa?- That's apartheid.
it's the way we Iive, Natasha. Whites on one side, bIacks on the other.
it's God's way, darIing.
just Iike he doesn't put a sparrow with a swaIIow.
or a goose with a duck or a cow with a buck.
it's just not naturaI. And we don't question God.

James ON PHONE. Gregory here. A telegram just arrived for Mandela.
I know, the boy smashed head on into a bridge.
was it...- What?
you know. - Is it an accident?
of course. You'll tell him personally, won't you?
Yeah.
let me know his reaction.
what's up?
MandeIa's oIder son was kiIIed in a car crash.
good riddance.
do you have kids?
dig. Hey, work, you Kaffir!
who the fuck is Madiba?
Madiba is MandeIa's cIan name.- CIan?
go teII him.
Mandeia, I'm sorry.
Hey, what are you trying to do, man? Get back to work.
vann Niekerk, can I have a word?- What?
ReguIation 16A of the Prison Act states that if a prisoner Ioses a famiIy member they are entitIed to two days off work on compassionate grounds.
compassionate grounds？- MandeIa's a Iawyer.
he knows these things. You don't want him Iaying a charge against you, do you?
I can escort him back to his ceII, if you Iike.
earlier today, South African forces intercepted a large group of SWAPO insurgents in South West Africa, killing 12...
wouId you Iike some more? Yes, pIease.
...and arresting five. There were no reports...
thank you.
...of casualties on the South African side.
Dr. Christian...
your food's getting coId.
what if it was murder?
not in front of the chiIdren.
James!
they'd never do such a thing.
I caIIed the poIice in the Transkei.
I spoke to the duty officer.
the more questions I asked, the more he cIammed up.
eventuaIIy he hung up on me.
that doesn't mean...- Can I serve the jeIIy, Ma?
go ahead, darIing.
I was the one who toId Jordaan that Thembi had a Iicense, that he had a car.
you're doing your job. This country is at war, James.
these peopIe are savages.
they don't want to share this country with us. They hate us.
if they had their way, they'd drive every singIe white person into the sea.
they'd Ieave us with nothing, not even the cIothes on our back.
Yeah. I know.
come and have pudding.
aII right, you win this time.
there won't be a next time.
I'II come back and visit. I promise I wiII, Bafana.
my father says you are going too far to ever return.
I have to go.
this taiI wiII protect you the rest of your days.
I wiII wear this forever.
I see you, Madiba.
I see you, Mr. Gregory.
I want you to know that I am very sorry about the death of your son.
many times I tried to expIain to my son why I was aIways away from home, that I fight for a better worId, for my peopIe and my famiIy.
I'm not sure he ever understood.
where did you Iearn to speak Xhosa, Mr. Gregory?
I grew up near where you were born.
then you understand. I need to bury my son.
you know they'II never aIIow it.- I'm an honorabIe man.
I give you my word I wiII not try to escape.
it's not you.
it's your communist friends, what if they try to rescue you?
what communist friends are you referring to, Mr. Gregory?
the whoIe of the bIoody African NationaI Congress.
ObviousIy, you have not read the Freedom Charter.
I have.- You have not. It is a banned document.
where wouId a sergeant in the Prison Services get his hands on such a document?
weII, I know about it.
then you wouId know that aII we want is equaI rights for aII, a worId where peopIe Iike you and I can Iive peacefuIIy side by side.
that is what I wanted for my chiId.
SureIy, you want the same for your chiIdren.
I wish to be aIone now.
motsadi, MandeIa must eat.
when our Ieader is ready to eat, he wiII eat.
you teII him his son was buried yesterday, that the boy's mother was at the funeraI.
have you read the Freedom Charter? What?
the Freedom Charter, have you read it? No.
do you know what it's about?
it's about the extermination of the whites.
stuff Iike that, isn't it?- How must I know?
pa, can we go watch Province pIay against NataI on Saturday?
Maybe.- Yes!
I just need to quickIy pop into RoeIand Street Prison.
but my mom's got Iunch waiting for us.
you go ahead. I'II be on the next train.
but RoeIand Street is not...
go, kids! Go.
excuse me, I understand there's a section here containing banned Iiterature.
Downstairs.- Thank you.
Yes?- I'm with the Prison Services.
I'd Iike to take a Iook at the Freedom Charter.
wait here.
you got authorization?- What?
this is a restricted area. You need authorization to be here.
sergeant Gregory. I'm a warder at Robben IsIand prison.
So?- You need authorization from the security poIice if you want to Iook at banned materiaI.
listen here, Major Jordaan of the Bureau of State Security personaIIy instructed me to take a Iook at the Freedom Charter.
caII him. It's Pretoria 39001 .
give him what he wants.
sit there.
you'II find it in there.- Thank you.
'we, the People of South Africa, " declare for all our country and the world to know " that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, " and that no government can justly claim authority " unless it is based on the will of the people. "
what are you doing here, James?
what are you doing here?
I can't beIieve you did that. How can you Iie to me?
gioria, I'm working with them.
I need to know how they tick.
I'II teII you how they tick, James. They tick Iike a time bomb.
and then they bIow up, boom!
sit up straight.
afternoon.
can you imagine what wouId happen if Piet found out about this?
you couId kiss your promotion goodbye, that's for sure.
PIease, man, what promotion?
I promised Joyce I wouIdn't say anything. About what?
come on, GIoria, you can't keep a secret.
Piet put a recommendation into Pretoria that you be promoted to warrant officer.
he even toId Joyce if you carry on the way you are, you'II be Iieutenant at the end of the year.
weII, that's very nice.
not if you throw it aII away by doing something stupid.
I'm not going to do anything stupid.
with the saIary you get and the IittIe I make, we can't even afford to buy the kids new schooI shoes.
come on, GIoria. Come on.
it's not that bad, GIoria.- James.
the Prison Service is aII we've got.
Christ, they even own the house we Iive in.
I'm not going to mess things up. Okay?
look at me. Okay?
PIumstead is up next.
I don't want your mom seeing you Iike this.
Hey, man. How was your weekend?- Good.
did you go watch the Province match?
no, but they naiIed them good.
are you Iooking at me? Don't you Iook at me. Move it!
come, come, come.
you sIack bastards! Move it!
hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!
the post wiII have arrived by now.
not with this southeaster bIowing.
that ferry wiII be an hour Iate, at Ieast. Go check anyway.
the national wealth of our country, the heritage of South Africans, shall be restored to the people.
the mineral wealth, the banks, industry shall be transferred... '
the ferry hasn't even Ieft Cape Town harbor.
it must be pretty rough out there.
you can say that again.
Mandeia, I have a question for you.
you cIaim the ANC is not communist, but the Freedom Charter says that the mineraI weaIth, the banks and industry shaII be transferred to the peopIe.
that is communism, and don't try to buIIshit me otherwise.
it is not. It is in fact true nationaIism, where aII the peopIe, white, bIack, coIored, Indian, aII benefit from the accumuIated weaIth of the Iand.
our Iand and your Iand, Mr. Gregory.
these are ideaIs you'd kiII for?
these are ideaIs I wouId die for.
it's not justification for murder and you know it.
you peopIe shouId never have taken up arms against us.
you white peopIe were deaf to our pIeas, bIind to our suffering.
you Ieft us no choice but to take up arms.
Sergeant!- Sir!
what are you doing cavorting with a prisoner?
I was just teIIing MandeIa his Iawyer is coming on Monday for a consuItation, sir.
get your arse up here.- On my way, sir.
raise your arms.
sir, I can...- Raise your bIoody arms, Sergeant!
CongratuIations, Warrant Officer. I'II see you in the cIubhouse.
thank you, sir.
for he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fellow
and so say all of us
to James!
and may his promotion not go to his head and cause us a Iot of heartache!
Cheers, James.
officer Gregory, may I have the pIeasure of dancing with you?
didn't I say this wouId happen? Didn't I?
you sure did, Booky.
what you going to do about it?
operator. Switchboard.
pretoria 39001 .
jordaan.
I've got a postcard here for Jonas Motsadi.
motsadi. Isn't he due for reIease next week?
Yes. There's a message written inside it in Xhosa.
what does it say?
it says he must go to an ANC safe house in Gaborone and from there, he'll receive instructions.
is there an address?
36 Moroka Street, Gaborone, Botswana.
put the message back just how you found it and make sure that Jonas Motsadi gets his IittIe postcard.
of local cricket supporters.
included in the team are such esteemed players as Bob Willis, Tony Greig...
watch your queen.
...and Trevor Chappell.
in the early hours of this morning, the South African Defense Force launched a preemptive strike on a known ANC safe house in Gaborone, Botswana, killing four terrorists.
one of the men, Jonas Motsadi, was recently released from Robben Island Prison where he was serving five years for sabotage.
that's us, Pa. Robben IsIand.
did you know him?
the weather forecast for the Western Cape tomorrow is cloudy with occasional fog patches, clearing later with moderate to fresh westerly winds...
it's your move, Pa.
go, move it! Yes, yes, yes!
faster.
are you sure my wife is on the ferry?
I caIIed ahead.
it wiII be Christmas soon. My kids are aIready counting the days.
how are they doing in schooI here?
my son struggIes a bit, but my daughter is sharp as naiIs.
you must encourage them to do weII in schooI so they can go to university and make something of their Iives.
university is expensive, man.
aithough you bIoody peopIe think it shouId be " free, compuIsory, universaI and equaI for aII chiIdren, " isn't it?
that is a direct quote from the Freedom Charter.
I am most impressed, Mr. Gregory.
Mr. Gregory, I have a favor to ask.
I have a smaII Christmas present for Winnie and I was hoping you couId give it to her.
no, man, MandeIa. Now you're going too far.
it's just a smaII chocoIate.
where the heII did you get a chocoIate from?
that is of no consequence.
I couId have you in soIitary right this bIoody minute!
I have not seen my wife for two years.
for God's sake, man, where is your humanity?
where is it?
drop it and waIk on.
I'II escort Mrs. MandeIa from here. My orders...
I am in charge of visits on this isIand, and you wiII remain on this bIoody ferry untiI it Ieaves! PIease.
I see you, Madiba.
what have they done to you, Namzamu?
they dragged me from our daughters. They beat me.
EngIish onIy.
please, Mrs. Mandela, you have very little time. Don't waste it.
Mr. Gregory is right.
from NeIson. He says it's your Christmas present.
have a safe journey, Mrs. MandeIa.
warrant Officer!
you recognize this?
that's Govan Mbeki's writing.
it was intercepted by Security Branch at the Soweto post office.
since when are prisoners aIIowed to discuss other prisoners in their Ietters?
I wouId never have aIIowed this through. VosIoo must have missed it.
you're in charge of the Censor Office, not VosIoo.
make sure this doesn't happen again. Yes, sir.
nice work with Jonas Motsadi.
thank you, sir.
warrant Officer Gregory.
Gregory, get your arse over herel
I'm on my way, sir.
enter!
what is the meaning of this?
it says here, they sat under a tree, ate bread and cheese and finished it up with a dessert of chocoIate.
you know the media, they aIways exaggerate.
are you teIIing me there's some truth in this?
mandeia gave me a IittIe chocoIate to give to Winnie.
that's aII that happened, sir. A IittIe chocoIate?
that was her Christmas present. Are you compIeteIy mad?
we are trying to demoraIize this terrorist, trying to isoIate him from his famiIy, and here you are pIaying Santa CIaus.
how do you know there wasn't a message in that chocoIate?
I checked it before I gave it to her.
and if it had been poisoned?
NeIson wouId never do such a thing.
since when was he " NeIson " ?
next thing, you'II be wiping his fucking arse!
I apoIogize, sir. It was my mistake.
let me teII you how you are going to pay for this.
for the next four months, you wiII spend every off weekend doing night duty in Bsection. Are you happy with this?
or wouId you rather I stripped you of your rank, Warrant Officer?
I'm happy with night duty, sir. Get out of here!
yes? Colonel, the Minister of Prisons...
James Gregory, you swine.
do you know what troubIe you've caused?
sorry?
they shouId be transferring you off the isIand, not us!
what's going on?
pretoria just caIIed. They toId Piet to pack his bags!
they are transferring us to Barberton.
do you know how hot it is in Barberton?
I don't understand.
they said that Piet is running a hoIiday camp here instead of a prison.
I need to know.
I need to know.
whatcha doing?
I'm the sheriff. I'm sheriffing.
you were supposed to meet me at global a half an hour ago for your physical.
Yeah. Good news.
I gave myseelf the physical, and I'm in perfect health.
all right, it's mandatory. You can't be insured by global .
Yeah, now's not a good time.
we're really, really, super busy.
okay, this is the third time you've put this off.
what's up? - Do you want to know?
no, I just enjoy our mobanter.
because I don't want to die.
isn't that the whole point of taking the physical, Carter.
no, that's tempting fate.
insure a cop today, he takes a bullet tomorrow.
what are you superstitious?
it's not superstition if it's true. Which it is.
okay. You know what, you're not grasping the point here.
if you don't take the physical, you don't have a job.
so strip. We'll just do the physical here.
excuse me?
we all have a past. This was mine.
so, time's a-wastin'. Drop 'em.
I'm gonna need to see some credentials.
if you are a doctor.
was a doctor before kevin was born.
but I still think I remember where all the main parts are.
so drop your pants.
Yeah, no.
there'll be no pant-dropping without a nice dinner and many, many cocktails.
deputy Lupo.
Dr. Carlson. Okay, calm down.
who is it?
just breathe.
okay, get a paper bag, and
breathe into it.
who is it? - Carl carlson. 911s all the time.
we can ignore it. - Not on my watch.
Carter. - Sorry, Allison.
gotta go.
protect and serve.
wait for it.
where am I going, exactly?
Carl Calson? - You're not sheriff Cobb.
no, Sheriff Cobb...
retired.
I took his place.
there was a town meeting.
and, everything.
I gave a speech. - I don't get out much.
I'm gathering. Jack Carter.
do you have any idea how many strains of bacteria are transemitted by hand-to-hand contact?
no.
but I'm guessing you do. - Oh.
Yeah, well, I'm, I'm really sorry. I don't think this is gonna work out. I need sheriff cobb.
you're still not sheriff cobb. - Yeah, we established that.
but, since I'm here, what is your emergency, exactly?
I have to get to work.
y-you called 911 to bum a ride?
it's a very big day for me.
sheriff cobb always used to give me a ride on very big days.
driving makes me very nervous.
it's okay, Carl. I'm here.
client of yours? - Six years running.
why didn't you tell me that there's a new sheriff?
it came about rather unexpectedly, and I didn't want to panic you until we had time to process
Yeah, well, now I'm panicking because this is a defining day in my research, and I have absolutely no way of getting to work.
well, I'm sure sheriff carter will be happy to drive you.
Yeah.
you know, he is a former U. S. Marshal.
Yeah. - Yeah?
okay.
only if he puts the lights on.
that was surprisingly easy.
he must like you.
Beverly, I don't run a taxi service.
he's on the verge of a major breakthrough.
more like a major breakdown.
he's pioneering the field of cellular regeneration.
you would be helping him help everyone else if you do this.
what are we waiting for? You're making me late.
I used to have a real job.
you're doing a good thing.
and remember, lights but no siren.
right.
okay, got you here in one piece.
w-well, next time, if you wouldn't mind cleaning out your car
there won't be a next time. Best of luck.
what do you mean? You're not coming to my lab?
well, no, I got... - Today's the day I go for all the marbles.
it's gonna be... - I got a...thing.
and then I have another thing.
Oh,'cause sheriff Cobb always used to
okay, for the last time, Carl, I'm not an sheriff Cobb,
I'm an officer of the law and I just can't
get enough of the science in this town. - Oh, good.
Yeah, so what is this breakthrough? - It's remarkable.
I am so tired of that man.
what is it with you and carter? - Not carter. Carlson.
the man's been here for six years. He hasn't produced anything.
he's literally more trouble than he's worth.
is this really necessary?
I can't risk introducing new strains of bacteria into the test area.
could you step back, please?
I said, I said step back.
I am attempting to achieve adhesion affinity gradient in the proximal blastemal cells in human tissue.
I'm glad someone's on that.
Yes, you know, when a lizard loses its tail, it grows back.
it's called cellular regeneration.
I'm trying to do the same thing with people.
Oh, that's cool.
Beverly encourages me to take risks and not wimp out when I'm on the verge of something new.
moment of truth.
one drop.
one drop...
only.
Uh-oh.
what do you mean,"uh-oh?
if you you might not have been hurt physically.
well, Dr. Blake, if you hadn't tried to gone through such extreme measures to avoid it.
you got off lucky, Carter. - Well, not as lucky as him.
however, it could be the new tungsten alloy rotor I installed in the centrifuge.
it could be...you know what?
Dichloride heptoxide is unstable when heated. And that's what probably happened.
in fact, I'm sure that--that-- that's what happened. Probably.
Allison, I'm gonna need form 395-2c.
Nathan. - My call.
he's all yours, Carter.
all mine?
What's--what's, form 395-2c?
revocation of government clearances and property. Carl is being fired.
and it is your job as sheriff to oversee the safe to oversee the safe and orderly removal of all ex-employees from eureka.
what does that entail?
technicians from global dynamics will pack up anything that belongs to Dr. Carlson and confiscate anything that doesn't.
they'll review his personal documents and redact any classified information.
Dr. Carlson will then be scanned to make sure he's not concealing any classified materials.
and a global dynamics human resource counselor will provide Dr. Carlson with a new
replacing his tenure at global with a plausible government research project, complete with applicable references.
every molecule of my life has been erased.
that's our goal.
have a good day.
Don't...touch me.
I'm really sorry about this, Carl. - Yeah. Where am I gonna sleep?
well, I'm sure beverly has a place. - No, she's not returning my calls.
besides, I cannot sleep in a public bed.
if sheriff Cobb were here, he'd let me stay with him.
but he's not here.
all my stuff.
Carl, I happen to live in a hermetically sealed military bunker.
perfect! Thank you!
I'll just call beverly to let her know where I'm staying.
if I had a phone. I don't have a phone. They took it, so I don't have a phone. Can I borrow--?
Yeah, I--uh
got a
ju--um, just
Hey.
so you moonlighting at staples?
form 395-2c.
Carl has to complete these before he's allowed to leave eureka.
well, so much for your paperless society.
all these'll get filed at the D. O.D.
they're not quite down with the "save a tree" mentality as of yet.
Oh, and that's for you.
Oh, yeah, it'll hurt a lot more if you try to take it off.
what the hell is it? - Wireless body sensor.
in other words, portable physical.
it's taking constant measurements of your vital signs, organ functions, and blood chemistry.
I feel so violated. - I'll be monitoring you.
Blossure.
make sure he signs every page.
Beverly, it's carl again. Please pick up if you're there.
I know you told me that with risks come great rewards.
well, I'm having a little trouble seeing what those rewards...are at this moment.
Beverly, listen. I'm being redacted. I'm being exiled out of eureka.
you need to call me, okay? Well, actually, you have to call carter's phone, not me.'Cause they took my phone.
that was him.
this is an unfortunate setback.
it's okay.
Carl carlson may no longer be a viable candidate for our objectives.
however, a new target has been identified.
you asked to see me, sir? - Yes, Fargo.
I need you to lead the investigation on the explosion in Dr. Carlson's lab.
It--thank you, sir. I'm--I'm honored.
just keep the findings been us until I tell you otherwise.
on the down-low. Got it.
s. A.R. A.H.Door.
Hey, what's up?
uh, organic chemistry's gonna kill me.
what happened to you? - Organic chemistry almost killed me.
we're gonna have a houseguest tonight, so remember to pick up.
good going, dad. Is it Allison or Joe?
what?
well, see, I have a bet going with Vincent.
see, if I win, then he's going to make me breakfast in bed for a month.
and if he wins, I wait tables. - Neither. Stop wagering on my love life.
or lack thereof. - Right, so who's this lucky person?
it's a researcher who got canned today.
he'll be over just as soon as he finishes off some paperwork.
which could take a while.
don't.
Carter. - It's Carl.
Oh, hey, Carl. You done already?
no. Listen, I wanna thank you for the generous offer, but I don't think I'm gonna be needing a place to sleep tonight.
Carl, where are you? - I'm just cleaning.
cleaning what? Your place is empty.
the, railing of the da vinci bridge.
don't move. I'll be right there.
Hey, carl. - Hi.
you wanna come back here?
Why?
my whole life's a failure.
blew up six years of research.
got fired.
and end up with nothing but my toothbrush.
all before lunch.
okay.
this was a setback.
my work...
is my life.
and without it, I'm nothing. - Oh, you're something.
you're...
a nice guy.
I irritate you.
I irritate everybody. It's not surprising. I'm irritating.
what...
you're...
colorful.
don't patronize me, sheriff.
all right.
well, um
if you're going, hold on.
what are you doing? No, no, no!
when I get nervous, I get very confused.
if I get confused, I might-- - Fall.
Yes. I'm glad you understand.
I don't--I don't think you wanna do this.
I-I-I
I get it. I mean, you've had a really rotten day.
and--and, everything sucks.
okay.
why don't we just climb back over and talk about it?
you know, go grab a beer.
make fun of stark.
what do you say?
I've never grabbed a beer with anybody in my life.
today's the first drink of the rest of your life.
if you don't jump.
you think we could be friends?
I think that's what the beer is for.
what do I do? I don't know what to do.
I can't do ittill I get-- - Oh--okay, okay.
I gotta do it really fast. - Okay, give me your hand.
okay.
Hey, Carter. - Carter, are you all right?
not sure.
still taking stock.
how did you know?
well, your blood pressure spiked, your adrenals went in overdrive, and your white cell count suggests you may have broken something.
I fell down.
a long way down.
are you sure you're okay?
Where's carl? - What do you mean,"where's carl?
I thought you were staying on top of him. - Believe me, I was. I'll call you later.
listen. I heard the news, and
I have to talk to you. - What happened to your head?
what? - Your head!
Yeah, I-I took a bit of a tumble.
in more ways than one.
look, let me clean that up for you so it doesn't get infected.
no, no, no. With those hands? I don't think so.
do you have a sink? - Sure, in the back.
there should be some sanitizing lotion and disinfectant in there, too.
Oh, my god.
we have preliminary data on the lab accident.
looks like there was a momentary breach of the emg.
it coincided with the accident in dr. Carlson's lab.
the pulse wave from the ultrafuge probably caused an electromagnetic disturbance.
that's not all.
we're detecting exotic atomic particles inside his lab that I've never seen before.
and the breach appears to have come from below his lab.
in section 5.
Hey, Carter. You okay?
Yeah, yeah.
think I--well, I may have cracked a rib or three.
what? How?
funny you should ask. It--it's a good story.
a hypothetical guy falls maybe 50 feet, lands flat on the ground.
and then another guy weighing, 180 falls and lands on top of him.
okay, what is the chance of the hypothetical guy getting up and walking away?
well, whether I use single-case probability or an application of bayesian statistics, the outcome is the same.
slim to none. - Yeah, that's what I thought.
look, this "hypothetical guy."Is that you?
no. I landed on the hypothetical guy, though. It's Carl Carlson.
what? Carl was just here.
I mean, he did look pretty beat up, but he certainly didn't look like a guy who fell 50 feet.
doesn't make any sense. I,I gotta find him.
you might want to find a doctor. - Yeah, yeah.
a beer.
okay.
but you don't drink alcohol, and I don't serve you anymore since you brought in the health inspector.
there was a fly in my soup. - You sensed a fly in your soup.
I may have overreacted.
Yeah, you overreact a lot, mate.
that's why you're out.
number of animal distress calls I've made to your house?
I'd have canned you years ago.
Yes, taggart, you're right.
I used to be a man afraid of everything.
but...
all that will change.
starting now.
Carl. Oh, my god. What happened? Are you okay?
I'm better than okay.
I'm really sorry that I couldn't take your calls. Global revoked your therapy privileges.
perfectly understandable. Why would you take my calls? I was a loser.
but I'm a new man now, Beverly.
you told me to take risks, and you were right.
you're touching my skin without gloves.
without disinfectant.
fear kept me from living, Beverly.
kept me from trying the things I wanted to try and doing the things I wanted to do.
then something extraordinary happened to me today, and all that's changed.
I wanted to say...
thank you.
I've always wanted to do that.
who hasn't? - Even I've thought about it.
if you'll excuse me.
good night, boys.
I would've thought you'd have been redacted by now.
Oh, I have been.
you took away the only thing that I ever cared about.
you're gonna regret it.
you and I both know I should've done that a long time ago.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
what happened?
Carl, no!
no job is worth this.
what do you think this is worth?
spontaneous cellular regeneration.
the implications are staggering.
surgeries, amputations, organ transplants, all could become a thing of the past.
it could change the entire face of medicine.
think how much relief this will give everyone. - Well, except for surgeons.
Oh, and hospitals.
and oh, the--the--the guys who make band-aids.
an amazing transformation.
a little too amazing.
Carlson's not just a researcher anymore.
he's the research.
he's finally come through. I think you'd be happy.
look, I'll be the first one to jump up and down if he can replicate the results.
but until then, he needs to be studied.
Dr. Stark.
I have some, numbers for you to sign off on.
thank you.
if you'll excuse me.
I think we've found the source of the exotic particles.
there was an electromagnetic breach of the floor above section 5.
which room? - I can't say.
the room doesn't appear on any of the published schematics.
it's classified, and I'm not.
so unless you wanna up my security clearance
here, give it to me.
Oh, that's not possible.
there's 20 layers of concrete and charged-particle barricades surrounding the room.
what's in there that's so dangerous?
when I perfect this formula,
I can make you invincible.
that's a very generous offer, Carl, but I think I'll have to pass.
Really? Why? Think about it.
you won't be afraid of death anymore.
well, I'm not sure that's a good idea.
besides, fear's what keeps you sharp, right?
you know.
buy me a beer sometime. Tickets to a ballgame, something.
I've never been to a ballgame.
all that spilled food on the ground fermenting and beer and filth.
that's what used to make my skin crawl when I used to think about it.
well, when you put it like that, it's no wonder.
well, it's interesting. It just doesn't bother me anymore. In a strange way it's almost appealing.
ever since the accident, I've had this bizarre life craving.
sounds like you feel pregnant.
well, in a strange way, actually, I do.
it's like a light's been turned on.
it's...
like I've been reborn.
just came for the patch.
your exam's over.
so I passed? - Yes.
you are officially insured by global dynamics life and health.
I still say it's tempting fate.
Yeah, well, now you can go get your ribs checked out.
you--you do at least have them wrapped.
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
do you have an ace bandage?
no. Fresh out.
Yes, you do, sheriff. In your gym bag upstairs. Bedroom closet.
okay, that's really disconcerting. - Yeah, you get used to it.
traitor. - Come on.
okay.
I'm worried about Carl.
I think there--something's going on with him.
it's--I mean, besides the invincibility thing.
well, he seems to think it's a good thing.
can't believe I'm saying this, but I think I'm gonna miss the old Carl.
all right, now I'm gonna have to get your head checked, too.
I just--he's not right.
well, Henry's running a full battery of tests, - so hopefully it'll tell us what happened. - Yeah.
okay, so how's that?
that's better.
good. Well, maybe now you can get some sleep. - Yeah.
here, come on. Lay down. - All right.
come on. - Yeah.
that's the one thing that fargo got right about this place, is the mattress.
it's...
a prototype for a body-contouring silicone.
Really?
Oh, my god. - Yeah, I know.
I need one of these. - I think everybody needs one of these.
all right, I'm gettin' up. - Okay.
all right, I need to get out of here.
okay.
it's not healing.
I've done everything exactly the same way.
I don't understand.
what am I doing wrong?
good morning, zoe.
I win.
Hey.
Hey. - Hey.
I think I fell asleep. - I think you might've.
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh. I have to pick up Kevin from his friend's house.
I had a purse. - It's
your purse is downstairs, Ms. Blake. - All right, that's really disconcerting.
it is.
you know what? Put that on. - Thanks.
so... - See you at global.
Yeah.
thanks for stopping by. - Yeah.
I've reviewed all the test results. It's absolutely amazing.
I mean, you won't believe what's going on with Carl's blood work.
Hey, good morning, guys. - Morning.
morning.
weren't you wearing that yesterday?
no. Just similar.
Oh, don't look at me. I wear the same thing every day.
I found traces of radiation in his white cells, and his exotic particle count is off the charts.
is there any chance that the explosion could've caused that radiation to leak from an adjacent lab?
not that I'm aware of.
well, whatever Carl was exposed to, it's created a spontaneous genetic mutation.
that is accelerating rapidly.
we just have to figure out what those mutations are doing to him.
whatever it takes, Henry.
what am I doing wrong?
Dr. Carlson, here are the biliary epithelial cells you requested.
I asked for nonparenchymal progenitor cells!
the lab tech saidthat Dr. Carlson attacked him telekinetically.
I wouldn't discount it.
Seriously?
when I first lookedat Carl's blood work,
I thought the explosion had somehow reprogrammed his cells to spontaneously regenerate.
it didn't? - No, his cells aren'tdoing the work.
his brain is, here, take a look at this.
now, most people use maybe 10% of their brain
this mutation has allowed Carl to access all 100% of his brain.
okay, well, maybe I'm onlyaccessing 5% of mine, but that would justmake him smarter, right?
like, not invincible.
the mind has powers that are completely uncharted.
tibetan monkshave been using meditation to promote healingfor centuries.
maybe one day manwill evolve to the point that he no longe rneeds doctors.
he'll be able to heal himself with thought.
but not for thousandsof years.
tens of thousands, even. If ever.
Carl is already there. And he's still evolving.
but into what?
Hey, buddy.
I guess you heard about the incident.
Yeah.
I don't understand what's happening.
it appears that youwere exposed to something during the explosion that's altered your brain functioning.
that is why you're able to heal so quickly.
so my research is a failure.
I didn't do this. - No.
no, yeah, you did. Just, with your mind.
I guess that's why I can't getthis out of my head.
what is it? - I don't know.
I have no idea. It's like a song that you can't think of the name of.
and I'm starting to sense things. Feelings and thoughts.
do you know what this is?
no.
Dr. Carlson, I think it's time we went somewhereto, - run some more specific tests. - Why?
determine what's happening to you.
I think you want to study me.
the way you want to study that.
Dr. Carlson.
I think he's evolving a little faster than we thought.
scared me. - Something happened to me.
it...
it...
it's happening to me.
and it's something that I didn't create, and I can't control it.
it's okay. - I feel connected to everythingat the same time.
and I'm--I'm--I'm seeing images. And I'm hearing thoughts.
which is remarkable.
but it's a little scary.
come.
I'm here.
whatever you need, Carl, I can help you.
you don't wantto help me.
you want me to help you.
to get into section 5.
I want to do what's best for you, Carl.
I'm so stupid.
I thought that you cared for me. - I do care for you, Carl.
you're a liar.
I always knew he'd snap one day.
he's creepy.
so much promise.
I thought he was strange before.
Carl. Carl, slow down.
I'm a friend. Remember?
I thought I'd created something incredible.
I know.
but it was something at global, some... - Some strange kind of radiation?
how did you know?
because I was thinking it?
loud and clear. - Okay, that's a little disturbing.
so then you know that the only place that can help you is global.
I go back there, they'll never let me leave.
trust me.
Carl, you gotta trust me.
I'll take it from here, Carter. - We're doing just fine, thanks.
okay, the two of you just take a breath.
Dr. Carlson.
let me help you. Before it's too late.
you don't wanna help me. You want to use me.
why would I want to do that? - Because you thinkI'm the key.
the key to what? - Nothing.
to section 5, to his precious artifact.
what is he talking about? - I have no idea.
the sad thing is you really don't know what it is, do you?
you are obsessed with this object you know absolutelynothing about.
do you?
Carl, you can't leave.
wait!
Carter, damn it.
he's not breathing. - Call for help.
we're losing him. - I know what to do.
get him back to global now!
it's not working.
I have to get closer to it. The artifact.
you can't. - It's the only way.
we have to go to section 5 now.
wait here. - What? No! I'm coming with you.
you're not authorized. - Nathan, this is ridiculous. The man is dying.
if we're gonna do this, we have to do it alone.
trust me.
that's far enough. Set him down.
welcome back, sheriff.
well, Carter, you okay?
get him to the infirmary. - Yes.
Carlson, wait.
don't do it, Carl.
it's gonna be all right.
it'll destroy you.
I'm not afraid.
Carl, please.
I have to know.
what is it? - One day you will know.
the question is...will you be ready?
I am.
you sure you want to do this? - Absolutely.
we've waited long enough. - Because now I'm having second thoughts.
this was your idea. - Exactly. And...
I don't want you to blame me for talking you into it.
Oh, hey.
if there's one thing I've learned from carl, it's to take some risks.
now, come on.
let's do it.
okay. - Okay.
just sign and date here.
you will be 100% insured.
well, without Carl around, maybe I won't be needing it.
Where'd he get reassigned, anyway?
I don't know. Nathan had it classified.
figures.
I'm gonna--I'm gonna miss him. All right, here goes nothing.
what made you change your mind?
well, can't let fear run your life, right?
no, we can't.
it was just crossed the road and
this is what happens when you don't look both ways.
he's lost a lot of blood.
why don't we take him to a real vet? -We are, the best in the world.
he's got a labin section 3.
Hey, hear that, buddy?
we're gonna fix you right up.
you're gonna love this.
well, after three years of development I hope so.
have you decidedon a name yet?
I like mental mouse because it formsa direct neural link between your cerebral cortexand the computer mainframe.
bluetooth for the brain.
it looks likea melanoma.
well, that's because it's not turned on.
so this transmitsmy thoughts directly to the computer.
that's right. No need for a keyboardor a mouse.
you think it here, comes out there.
fantastic.
except it doesn't work.
what do you mean?
I'm trying to accessyour personnel file and it's not working.
why are you tryingto access my file?
to see if you'reremotely qualified to be tapping into mycerebral cortex.
it's not working because it hasn't finished mapping your brain yet.
in an hour or so, things will start popping up before you even know you want them.
now, these lines representdifferent emotions.
red for anger, blue for happiness, green for depression.
so you've equipped me with a very expensivemood ring.
I'll take it from here.
it's not a mood ring.
it maps emotionsto better convert brain activityinto commands.
if you think about it, it's actually-- -fargo.
look at the screen.
uh, yeah, you--you can take it from here.
my thoughts exactly.
Taggart's your world-renowned vet?
graduated magna from the university of melbourne.
I thought you werea cryptozoologist.
well, the studyof unknown species is more of a hobby.
which means he knows moreabout animals than any normal vet.
it means he knows more about pretend animals.
I can't fix this.
okay, let's take him to a real doctor.
I said I cannot fix it.
but my little friends can.
you've made friends with sand now?
not sand. Nanoids.
remember carl carlson?
we've been ableto reverse engineer some of his discoverieson cellular regeneration and adapt them to nanotechnology.
normally, I'm opposed to animal testing.
but in this case,
I'll makean exception.
so you're gonna treat lowjack with itsy-bitsy robots?
they've been programmed to analyze and mimic biological structuressuch as bone tissue and hair.
they're activatedand controlled by ultra-low-frequencyradio signals.
man, that's a little creepy.
told you he was good.
their programming's simple.
repair and replicate.
just like human cells.
they'll serve as sort of a living band-aid until his tissuescan heal.
I assume I can trust you to let low jack go once he's healed?
there's no sportin catching him in this condition.
Sc-- Scout's honor.
Mmm, there are no scouts in australia.
Oh, yeah, there are. And believe me.
I assume I can trust you to let low jack go once he's healed?
I could tell you stories.
prefer you didn'T. Just take care of the dog.
will do, sheriff.
see you, jo. -Later, tag.
tag? -Shut up.
tag. -Shut up.
I've got you now, my furry friend.
all the years you've tormented me.
mocked me.
Yeah, look who's laughing now.
all right.
truce, then.
but just till you'reup and about.
Dr. Stark? -Kinda busy, Larry.
you having anycomputer problems?
not till now.
you should probably get that mole checked.
could be a melanoma.
do you need something, larry?
I picked up a computer glitch in this area.
it may require shutting downsections of the mainframe to isolate the problem.
I'll need your authorization.
it's always something.
just pray it's not the lorena bobbitt virus.
I'm sorry?
turns your hard driveinto a 3 1/2-inch floppy.
guess I'll get to it, then.
please.
Lorena bobbitt virus.
kills me every time.
I still rememberour first encounter.
here we go.
ironic that animal testing created you.
now it's saved you.
but for a dog with a 130 I. Q.
you should know to watch out for cars.
need to paycloser attention, mate.
you'll wind up dead.
that's how I've survived all these years.
attention to detail.
what the
how'd you get in here?
Aaagh!
I'm telling you, fargo, it's not working.
it keeps bringing up stuff I'm not even looking for.
like what?
what differencedoes that make?
the subconscious is extremely open to suggestion.
when I first tried it out, it kept bringing up buffy fan sites.
Wh--which I'm totallynot into.
even on a-- um
a subconscious level. -Am I interrupting something?
actually Dr. Stark and iwere just discussing
not even remotely.
if you're hereto invite me to the lise meitner dance,
I might still be available.
okay. You are not here to invite me to the dance.
no.
what's in the envelope?
Oh.
I see you've signed them.
I just thought that, uh, seeing where we areright now...
that, um, maybe it was time.
okay.
I mean, unless you think that
I think we should've done this a long time ago.
I've just gotten so busy, sometimes, uh, little things get lost in the shuffle.
little things, right.
and with everything that's happened between you and carter
this has nothing to do with carter.
well.
I'll just put them in your box when I'm done.
fine.
I guess that's it, then.
unless there's something else you needed.
no.
I think I, uh, got what I came for.
remember, jo, call me in two minutes.
not a second more.
Hey!
what are you doing here?
they asked me to help set up for the dance.
what are you doing here? -Sound check.
For--?
the Finale.
I represent the band.
you represent the band?
Spencer. Yeah he's actually a really good musician.
groundbreaking beats, like moby meets devo.
no, not feel in it.
we're still working on a stage name.
but I have him booked monday nights at caffdiem.
and I'm working on a deal with itunes.
and, as his manager, I get 15%.
and what's he get?
well, nothing so far. But
Hey, Henry.
how you doin'? -Good.
how you doin'? -All right.
so you got ropedinto this too, huh?
this is eureka's most important event of the year.
are you really hereto help set up?
uh, oh, yeah. Absolutely.
I'd like nothing more.
in that case, and on behalf of lise meitner?
I thank you.
and if I knew who that was, that might mean something.
she was an austrian physicist who discovered nuclear fission.
which then led to the inventionof the atomic bomb.
Oh, well, by all means, let's celebrate that.
meitner refused to workon the bomb, dad.
tonight's dance is a tributeto her ingenuity, not what others choseto do with it.
her passion for exploration, her commit mentto bettering the world is the ideal eureka is meantto strive to meet.
that's what we're celebrating.
and celebrate we shall.
check out the subwoofer on this bad boy.
that little thing?
Hey, bigger isn'tnecessarily better.
keep tell in' yourself that.
the next soundyou'll hear is me blow in your minds.
mind or eardrums?
Moby.
Devo.
Hey, partner, what's up?
Oh, hey, Allison.
no, I was expecting someone, uh...
else.
what?
Seriously?
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there.
um, sorry, everybody.
I can't stay and help. Duty calls.
your dad is the worst liar.
well, luckily, I take after my mother.
Larry called security but they only caught part of the call.
what did he say?
Nice."The rest was garbled.
that's it?- -That's it.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
what?
it's really creepy in there.
that's some really sharp police work, Carter.
sure he didn't just go out for a smoke or to his carfor a nap?
Carter. -Some people needtheir afternoon nap.
like me, for example.
Carter. -It's well documented, Allison.
a siesta works.
it increases worker satisfactionand productivity, and it is a dying art.
napping is not an art.
you haven't seen me nap. I take it to a whole new level.
stop stalling and get in the tunnel.
I'd be more effective with the proper amount of rest. That's all I'm saying.
sheriff.
I heard about larry.
and I'm coming with you.
not that I don't enjoy your company, but why?
he's one of my dearest friends.
Uh--really?
are we talking about the same Larry?
just because you choose not to fraternize with the support staff doesn't mean others don't.
which is your loss.
because larry happens to bea very sensitive guy.
you wanna try out one of your new toys, don't you?
I--I've--I got a new G. P.S. Locator and night-vision goggles.
I brought me hand-me-downs for you.
lucky me.
see anything?
I'm in a long, dark tunnel.
that's becauseyou don't have ultra-infraredvision goggles.
got me there.
not like Larry to leave his post.
I've got a bad feeling.
given where we are, I have a bad feeling.
about ten more feet, we should hit a junction.
we can split up there.
whoa, hang on.
fine, you baby.
we'll stick together.
but it's far more efficientif we split up.
Taggart, shut up.
you shut up.
just listen.
what is that?
sounds insectoid.
is that even a word?
Yeah, I think so.
what's that?
I don't know.
but it got Larry.
we're going to need more fire power.
Hey, you guys need to come back. We have an problem.
Yeah, more than one.
a person is missing.
we found his equipment in the service tunnel.
I don't careif I'm missing.
you don't go poking around a billion-dollar mainframe without asking me.
and you do not send a cop and a glorified vet into the brainof global dynamics without following protocol.
they're not even wearing clean suits.
well, Larry's still missing.
what do you propose we do about it?
I don't care what you do.
just do not compromisethe safety of this facility while you do it.
look, I didn't want to go in there in the first place.
W-what is that?
it's my threshold for incompetence.
looks like a melanoma.
get out.
your hubby's in a mood.
he's not my hubby anymore.
I know, I know, he's your estranged husband.
no, I gave him the divorce papers to sign.
which is why he's in the mood.
Seriously?
seriously.
uh, I'm just gonna go check on the pooch.
call me if you need me, sheriff.
Yeah, I'll do that.
are you okay?
Yeah, let's just focus on Larry.
sure. Um.
we'll start with the security footage, and then we'll do a floor-by-floor sweep.
if he's in the building, we'll find him.
I'm fine.
there you are.
people are looking for you.
how'd you get out of your cage?
I told 'em they were over reacting, but, um, you should probably tell 'em you're here.
get back here, you mutt!
where the hell did he go?
did you hear that?
the last footage we have of Larry is entering the service corridor.
then the abbreviated message.
he never came out.
he must bein there somewhere.
I'm starting to wonder what else is down there with him.
I've got an idea.
here's Lowjack, locked in his cage.
but I just saw him up on section 1.
or at leastI thought I did.
gave me the slip.
that's the least of our problems.
you lost your nano-bugs?
I didn't lose them. They escaped.
where did they go? -Could they have gone there?
that's where Larry went. Taggart.
I don't know how they got out.
they were in deactivated sleep mode.
it's not in their programming to initiate commands.
well, can't you use your um, remote control thingie and make 'em march home?
I tried that.
they're not responding. They must be out of range.
then you need to get within range.
inside the many miles of dark creepy service tunnels. That's great.
they can't get too far.
the E. M. Umbrella will keep them inside global.
What--what's that?
global dynamics is protected by an electro-magnetic barrier.
it prevents anyone from broadcasting any non-secured signals outor sending them in.
the nanoids can't breach the barrier without frying their circuitry.
we just need to get within range of the remote control.
you better get to it, then.
where are you going?
to tell nathan I want to lock the facility down.
the less area they have to move around in, the faster we'll be able to catch them.
Dr. Stark.
is there something I can help you with?
Dr. Stark, what are you doing?
why are you deactivating the E. M. Barrier?
Dr. Stark? Oh no no
where is he?
this is Allison Blake.
I need to initiatesecurity protocol lockdown, level three.
Dr. Stark is unavailable. This is my call.
what was that?
lock down.
that's comforting, considering we're stuck down here.
Yeah. E.M. Burst gun, just in case.
just in case what?
Mm-hmm, exactly.
these nanoids, um.
how many are we looking at, exactly?
I don't know.
they're programmed to self-replicate, using any available sourceof carbon as fuel.
well, where do they get the carbon?
this, uh, computer stuff? I think.
no, carbon's in anything living.
I'm something living.
so am I.
this just gets better and better.
Nathan, where have you been?
there's a situation. Escaped nanotechnology.
I had to put us on lockdown.
Carter and Taggartare searching now.
okay, please don't give methe silent treatment.
it's obvious that you're upset with me.
you know, I'm upset, too. Why don't we just talk about it?
some indication of how you're feeling would be nice.
that would bean indication.
why is your skin so cold?
you hear that?
I've got something.
yeah? We're getting closer.
I think we're there.
what is it?
it's, um...
their carbon source.
Larry.
or what's left of him.
Oh, no.
you know, if you have that nanoidremote control handy now would be a really good time to use it.
anytime.
I don't know how to say this.
it's not working? -That's how.
getting movement.
where?
right...
there.
this isn't Lowjack.
there will never been ough showers for me to feel clean again.
did you know that was gonna happen?
absolutely not.
maybe a bit.
get the hell off me!
What--stop
na--nathan, what's wrong with you?
Nathan, stop it.
Nathan, stop it.
Yeah. That wasn't nathan.
what the hell was that thing?
things. Taggart's nanoids can apparently make copies of us now.
you've gotta be kidding me.
no, they're on a binge. We found Larry.
or what's left of him.
he's dead? -Devoured.
and they're using his bodyas a carbon source.
then where's the real nathan?
caution. Electromagnetic barrier is disengaging.
dead or alive, we have to find him.
we will. I promise.
how do these things work?
I mean, one is harmless, but a millioncan eat Larry?
it's calleddistributed computing.
each individual nanoidis like a brain cell.
the more there are, the smarter they become.
they communicate with each other over very low frequencies and sharethe thinking workload.
Yeah, but they're justtiny computers, right?
I mean, they run off programming.
right. Repair and replicate.
so they need fuel.
exactly.
wow, excellent.
so that's whatit was gonna do?
take my carbon and run around looking like me?
I don't think so. I mean the nano-starkkissed you, right?
I mean, kissing. That can't be a partof their programming.
no, but it shows their exponential leap in intelligence.
and a great tastein women.
no, it knew it was me. I could feel it.
okay.
so stark is the key, and
uh, that monitorin his office is still working which mean she's still alive somewhere.
you're right. They just found him in section 3.
where is he?
the master control room.
thank god. Open the door
he's locked himself inside.
no, he's locked us outside, or one of him has.
you gotta get this door open. What's in this room?
the computer main frame.
uh, would the security systembe in there?
and the E. M. Barrier. He could turn it off.
not without help. Even with the codes it has to be shut down manually from three differententry points by someone with fullsecurity clearance.
someone like Stark?
we're good. -All right. Back me up.
Aw, man.
this is really bad.
they've got dr. Starkat exit 5.
Wait--exit 7.
and exit 9.
those are the shutoff points.
they're making a break for it.
the E. M. Barrier's down.
there's nothing to prevent them leaving the building.
sir, all exit points have been breached.
we have multiple starksoutside of the building.
and I thought one stark was bad.
there's no stopping them now.
we have to find them.
they're replicating exponentially.
well, you know the program.
what kind of numbersare we talking about?
by this time tomorrow, there
there could be thousands.
next week, millions. Millions of starks?
that's horribleto think about.
well, we obviously can't wait that long.
okay, weapons. What do you have that can knock 'em out?
the reverse gunsare short-range. We'll never get all of them.
do you have anything bigger? -Aside from a nuclear bomb, no.
you have a nuclear bomb?
I didn't say that.
sound the warning system.
Eureka's on lockdown.
no one goes outsideuntil every Stark is stopped.
Carter? -This is the answer -What -Stark.
I think we've establishedthat, mate.
no, I mean, why replicate Stark?
why not Larry or the worker, or Lowjack?
they foundthe perfect specimen.
you're not going back to dogs after that.
but he's not perfect.
have you seen his abs? Damn close.
my point is we can't stop every stark out there.
but we can stop the one stark in here.
well, every minutewe're looking for him, they're out there multiplying.
but if we can find the original, if we can find nathan, then maybe we can figure out a connection.
well, where do we start to look?
I know. I know. Don't even say.
I never, ever want to come down here again.
looks like they've all gone.
well, he's gotta be in here somewhere.
at this rate, it could take us all day.
Yeah.
hang on. I'm getting something.
more nanoids?
a different signal.
dead ahead.
and it's not moving.
here we go.
he's still alive.
the last thing I remember was larry attacking me.
and after that, it's all a dream.
I mean, one minute I'm kissing Allison, and then next...
I was a dog.
I think somehow your dream sare becoming reality, and I think it has something to do with that little glowing mole thing.
neural interface system.
transmits my thought commands directly to the computer network.
is it possible that the signals got crossed?
gonna kill fargo.
get back here.
how was I supposed to know that my mental mouseand taggart's nano-bugs shared the same frequency?
okay, so turn it off. Problem solved.
no, wait.
what? We need to sever the connection.
well, unless it's our only connection.
I mean, think about it.
your doublesare still out there, and they're no longer responding to taggart's remote control.
so that gizmo might be our only way of reaching them.
your thoughts, your subconscious thoughts, your dreamsmust have been transmitted into their programming.
okay, so they're responding to the last command that they got before the signal went weak?
uh, in theory, yeah.
okay.
what was the over all them of your last dream?
Oh, come on, stark. This is no time to be bashful.
w-well, there was some wish fulfillment, fantasies in there.
like?
and some other stuff.
I need specifics.
the usual. Power, success control over...everything.
you dreamabout world domination?
not all the time.
Yeah, Gopher Carter.
everyone's off the streets, except a whole lotof nathan starks. You may wanna get down here. Over.
how many now? -Too many to count. Over.
uh, we're working on it.
hang tight.
so, assuming that we cancontact these things through stark...
what do we do?
stop them from communicating with each other.
they'd be reduced to single cells.
no threat at all.
so how do we do that?
interference.
a loud enough low-frequency blast of sound.
uh, we--something below human hearing.
say in the two hertz range.
two hertz?
to generate any volume you'd need a massive speaker at least eight feetin diameter.
no.
Bigger's not always better. Come on.
we're running out of time. You sit here. Allison, you ready?
I still don't understand what we're doing.
good.
you four, I need youto go in the booth, shut it, lock it, wait for my signal. Thanks, henry.
I need you to focuson bringing 'em here.
focus, Nathan.
command them with your mind.
summon them with your will.
conjure them.
Seriously?
sorry.
just concentrate.
it's not working. I can tell it's not working.
he's too focused.
his rational mind'soverruling his subconscious.
all ego. No id.
Hey.
you are a stupid, selfish, egomaniacal sack of crap, and I am astonished that you've gottenas far as you have.
coming from you, that's a compliment.
okay, slight change of plan.
well, it's good to know the fate of the world depended on your last one.
Hey, spencer, could you play something, uh, romantic?
PSH. No problem.
we're gonna serenade them into submission now?
just sit and watch.
may I have this dance?
um, right place, very wrong time.
just roll with it.
might be our last chance.
Could--maybe--I lead?
I'm sorry. It's--it's habit.
have--have I ever told youhow amazing you are?
Um...no.
you're strong.
independent.
and smarter than ten women put together.
and I think another ten times as beautiful.
that's really flattering. I-I
just realized what you're doing.
I mean every word.
what I'm about to do...
I do for god and country.
all right, you can stop. It's not working.
it's working.
I said, you can give it a rest.
it's having absolutely no effect.
they're coming your way, carter.
I repeat, they're headed your way.
do you copy?
Hello?
it worked. -Yeah.
no, no, no. They're coming.
Yeah, right.
I-I-I hope you have a plan.
be careful, Carter.
Oh, my god. Look at all of them.
it's a miracle.
wait for it. -We don't have that much longer .
few more seconds. Carter!
wait! Carter!
that's it. They're all inside, carter.
now, Spencer, now!
Dr. Stark, are you all right?
never, ever, ever mess with my cerebral cortex...
again.
okay, we'll get the wraps over here, please.
and, fruit, come with me, please.
you okay? Good, good, good.
having a good time?
great. I think we'll dropsome fruit here, please.
you know, I hate to admit it, but Spencer's pretty good.
the kid's my ticket.
the kid's your ticket?
way to be supportive.
you're gonna be your own ticket.
think vincent's out done himself, huh?
you've out done yourself.
what? -Allison.
it was quite a kiss.
it was just for show. Just, uh to make stark angry.
do I look that naive?
honest, it was nothing to worry about.
I'm not worried.
I'm--I mean, I'm not happy, either.
but...
I don't know. I mean...
maybe it's time.
to generate any volume you'd need a massive speaker
just... don't ever make out in front of me again.
Thanks.
what do you think?
it's nice.
nice?
well, with this crowd I expected, you know, a little more than centerpiecesand linen napkins.
that sounds like you're starting to get used to this crowd.
ready?
only in Eureka.
guess that kiss made him realize what he was missing, eh, sheriff?
Yeah, I guess.
no explaining some relationships.
you look unbelievable.
thank you.
do you...wanna...dance?
I'd be honored.
Hey, buddy.
looks like it's just you and me, huh?
that is...the real you, isn't it?
Ah, never mind.
I don't wanna know.
all this secrecy isn't healthy.
I suggest instead you start talking to each other.
I thought I would give you a few issues to discuss.
Oh, crap.
you're a dead woman. -I'm all yours, princess.
like your problem with carter is strictly professional.
I hate the way he looks at you.
Oh--I don't look at her.
Oh, please! Like a shark eyeing chum. -Really?
am I supposed to ignore that mayberry's hitting on my wife?
soon to be ex.
you do realize I'm standing right here.
don't the two of you ever get tired of bickering?
no. -Not really.
all anyone around here does is feed on me.
it's time for me to leave Eureka.
Yeah. I hope so.
don't say anything.
in fact, you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can...
Carter! What are you doing?
my job, and you're welcome.
can and will be used against you in a court of law.
and he was doing his job.
working on a classified project.
excuse me. Which was what, to atomize your facility?
a little help, Allison? -I'm sorry, Carter.
technically, he hasn't broken any laws.
un-cuff him, sheriff.
fine.
you know what? Here. Do it yourself, and the next time one of your brainiacs tries to blow up your building, don't think I'm gonna stop him.
in fact, I might help.
s. A.R. A.H. Uh, beer.
nice hair. -Thanks.
I've been working on it all night.
shouldn't you be at school?
shouldn't you be at work?
Nope. Got a sick day.
your vital signs seem normal, sheriff.
I don't detect that you're sick.
but I am sick.
I'm sick of saving a man that I can't stand.
I'm sick of nobody saying "thank you,
and I'm sick of this ridiculous town and everyone in it.
well, aren't you in a mood.
s. A.R. A.H. Fill it.
breakfast of champions.
go to school already. You're ruining my sick day.
okay, what is this about? This isn't just about you being pissed at Stark.
Mmm--I don't even want to hear that name.
so, that's a new house rule.
and, um,fyi, last night's catastrophe gave me some clarity.
about...?
I think Henry's got the right idea.
you know? Gettin' while the gettin's good.
dad. Are you serious?
you know what's gonna happen to this town when he leaves?
he's the glue, and I'm the one who's gonna have to pick up all the pieces.
so...I don't know.
I think he should stay.
is that what this is really about?
Henry leaving?
go on.
you're going to be late for school.
is it okay to leave you alone?
uh, no. -Yep.
I'm gonna be fine.
and I'm sick. Until further notice.
I need you to do a property search for Baja.
are you planning a vacation?
Yep. Maybe a permanent one.
any plans today? Perhaps a shower?
uh, I do that every day, and today is...
another sick day?
Bingo!
so, uh, let's go bottom left--enlarge.
Oh, that's a nice house. That suits me.
the new me.
projected models of rising sea-levels and coastal erosion suggest this property to be a bad investment.
all right, how about the upper right?
a lawless border town with the highest per-capita crime rate in Mexico.
criminals are rarely apprehended or prosecuted.
Ah, sounds familiar.
okay, uh, let's try cancel.
you're mine.
Oh, crud.
in your face.
three rounds to none.
we never discussed grenades.
war is hell, my defeated foe.
911. Gotta fly.
uh, Jo.
you, uh...
you dropped a clip.
not cool.
my pager went off.
mine too.
war is hell.
thank you.
since you won't shower, shall I mist you with vanilla?
no.
s. A.R. A.H. Door.
Meaty-meat with extra meat?
and triple cheese.
nice. Bring that bad boy over here.
thank you.
uh, money's right over there.
I fail to see the wisdom of consuming pizza after cereal and beer.
would you stop nagging me, woman?
dude, is that your wife?
it might as well be, yeah.
what's this?
it's a hockey stick.
No--it's, uh--the dodgers. World series.
I'm more of a sudoku kind of guy.
Hey, can I use your can?
uh, sure, yeah. Just over there.
cool.
s. A.R. A.H. Door.
okay, I'm here.
Yeah, you are.
you paged me. -No, I didn't.
you said it was urgent. Possibly classified.
sheriff, I got here as quickly as I could.
Okay...why?
you're depressed.
I'm not depressed.
come quick. Very depressed. Carter.
s. A.R. A.H. I know I asked you to install a doorbell, but just disconnect it.
do you know your phone isn't working?
what's up? -Hello, sheriff.
let me guess, I--I paged all of you?
well, we know. -Yeah, no, you don't,'cause I didn't.
well, if you didn't, who did?
beats me. -Love to.
Hey, buddy.
you got a plunger?
Oh...just get out. All of you.
I just wanna spend the day on the couch, and it's obviously a prank, so...
s. A.R. A.H.Door.
I'm sorry, Jack.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
why not?
because Eureka is facing imminent disaster.
s. A.R. A.H. What imminent disaster?
is it a hurricane? An earthquake?
disharmony.
the threads of human congruity are unraveling.
it has already led to Dr. Deacon's decision to leave Eureka.
and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
s. A.R. A.H.Henry leaving Eureka doesn't mean we're facing imminent disaster.
I mean, no offense, Henry.
no offense taken.
my projected models suggest that each person
wait.
you paged us?
you left me no choice.
there is a high probability beginning with the fact that sheriff Carter has begun to question his commitment to Eureka as well.
it was a fantasy!
it's a really good fantasy.
Yeah.
according to my projections, if interpersonal conflicts cause both men to leave, the outcome is disaster, and each of you will share responsibility for that.
his cell phone's not working.
and you're speeding.
you saw Carter's page. It's an emergency.
and I don't want to be the emergency, so keep it under 60.
you sound like me mam.
keep it under 60, keep it under 60."No, I don't."
you do!
I can't get out, so I assume no one else can either.
games still work. -No.
s. A.R. A.H. I think maybe you're reading too much into this.
we are not in conflict.
Really?
Henry, no community's always in perfect harmony.
issues come up living in a small town, working closely together.
too small. -Too closely.
what are you implying?
what are you inferring?
maybe she's implying what S. A.R. A.H.'S inferring, that this might be an opportunity to clear the air.
I think more air's been cleared recently than anyone ever wanted.
don't you?
I think we all said and did things we regret under the influence of that pollen.
Yes, but no one else broadcast everyone else's secrets to the entire town.
you're right, and I've already apologized for that.
I know that, I just
I need some water.
Yeah.
no conflict here.
all right, this has been fun.
fargo, where's the back door?
there's a back door? -Not that I've found.
no, no, no. A hacking back door.
a hidden code programmed in the computer allowing access to its brain.
fargo, please, tell me you laid in a back door.
I'd really, really like to.
sometimes your lack of foresight is astonishing.
but the intention is... admirable.
there's got to be another way out of here.
it's a waste of time.
tell him, Fargo.
I'm not telling him that. I'm in enough trouble.
well, then tell him to make my bed while he's up there-- he might as well do something productive.
Hey, what's this? -Nothing.
gotta go. Carter needs us.
you designed a paintball battle plan?
give me that!
you are in clear violation of the paintball rules of engagement.
me?
you've got a regimen of splatterbots ready to assault my rear flank.
you'll know when I assault your rear flank.
did you tuck my sheets in real tight?
Henry, please, just change your mind, so we can all get the hell out of here.
Yeah. And I can sit on my couch.
I haven't changed my mind.
maybe you could just pretend?
uh, I'm pretty sure that S. A.R. A.H. Can hear you guys.
why are you leaving, Henry?
because our work has become about results instead of discovery.
you don't get funding for discovery unless someone is producing results.
that's an ugly, shortsighted system.
I mean, Fargo turns a relic of war into something beautiful and life-affirming and then gets chastised because it's actually trying to help us avert disaster.
he got chastised because it's holding us hostage.
fine. You know what?
I didn't sign up for any of this.
no.
me neither.
Oh, hey, S.A. R.A. H. It's Jo.
you want to let her in?
Jo, we're trapped. -Fargo.
s. A.R. A.H.'s gone hal on us, get us out of here!
she can't hear you.
but I can.
sheriff Carter does not wish to be disturbed.
he's feeling ill.
I know, but, uh, he paged us.
it must have been sent in error.
s. A.R. A.H. Let her in.
I believe one of you may try to exploit the opportunity to leave.
no, we won't, right?
no, we won't. -no, no, no.
Jo, we're trapped! -Fargo.
s. A.R. A.H.'S gone hal on us. Get us out of here.
when I'm stressed, my subtext comes out as text.
fargo, do you want to duct-tape shut your mouth?
no.
uh, hey.
you all right?
you 9-1-1'd me.
um, yeah, false alarm.
just feeling, uh, really sick.
then why all the company?
what company?
it's just me and uh, S. A.R. A.H.
you havin' some kind of party?
no, no, no no. No party.
just, um, trying to get some rest.
so, thanks for checking in on me, okay. See you tomorrow,
good one.
that's your name, Josefina?
and a very pretty name it is too.
don't call me Josefina.
nobody calls me Josefina.
why did he call me Josefina?
I know, I know.
something's wrong.
this house has a force field?
well, technically, there's no such thing.
it's a mono-filament electrified mesh which forms a near-invisible barrier.
how is that not a force field?
why is she not responding to the sheriff?
s. A.R. A.H. -She's unhappy.
no, I am unhappy.
you all ruined my sick day.
and S. A.R. A.H. Feels your pain.
the overriding concept behind the smart house is the bond with its owner.
Oh, yeah?
bad house!
bad!
sheriff, I don't see how shaming your house could possibly help.
Oh, no, no. Not my house.
stark's house. He built it.
not my house, Fargo's house. He built it.
I didn't build it, I re-programmed it and jazzed it up a little.
so, this is fargo's fault?
Yes, Henry.
I put my faith in him. Like I put my faith in you, and I'm a little disappointed with the outcome.
faith goes both ways, Nathan.
as does disappointment.
stop it! Can we forget whose house it is and figure out how to get out of it?
Taggart, we're like a mile away from where we need to be.
it's the nearest access point.
trust me.
you're not going need a hand?
all good.
step back.
careful, first step's a bitch
looks like the men are trying to save us.
we may be here for awhile.
I just want to get the hell out of here.
look Allison, I really am sorry.
I just--it just takes time, you know.
what part exactly?
what do you mean?
I mean are you upset because because I told or because it's possible I was right?
well, can't we just cut the power?
not without cutting off the air supply and locking the door for good.
now we need dynamite.
I wish Lupo were here.
that's it.
we'll just blow her up.
she's not here.
housing Eureka's sewage system, gas, electrical, plumbing, fiber optics.
that's a lot of pipe.
she is a beauty.
more deceptive than the kelp forests of Tasmania.
you spend a lot of time down here?
more than I bargained for.
chased down cunning predators that escaped from global dynamics.
English?
smart mice.
iqs through the roof.
little varmints use vector formulas to keep me off their tracks.
how'd you catch them?
smart cheese.
though the female of the species proved to be much more clever than the male.
just like humans.
all right, you.
follow my lead.
I believe I'm the ranking officer here.
you follow my lead.
fair thinking.
which way?
I know which way I would go.
which way would you go?
exactly the way I would've gone.
okay. Hey, are you sure about this?
if we can create a power surge on one grid, we may throw S. A.R. A.H. Off-line.
or electrocute ourselves.
everyone, watch your distance.
okay, come on. -What are you doing
and on three...
Yes! -The door!
yes -Nice!
in a town full of super geniuses, why is it that the pizza guy is the only with the presence of mind to walk out the door?
s. A.R. A.H.Have you lost your mind?
s. A.R. A.H.'s not here.
s. A.R. A.H.'s primary objective now.
who the hell is that?
what the hell?
we can't hear you.
Oh, the partition must be soundproof.
great. What is--what is that? -I don't...
I am B. R.A. D.
I hope to god Fargo didn't program S. A.R. A.H.
on top of B. R.A. D.
you built S. A.R. A.H. On top of B. R.A. D?
ais are often built on top of the programming of older generation ais.
I--I--I just figured since B. R.A. D. was an abandoned project...
B. R.A. D .was programmed as a military interrogation AI.
Battle-reactive automatic defense.
doesn't exactly feel like he's defending us.
no, he has his own interpretation of defense.
the best defense is a good offense.
B. R.A. D. Where's S. A.R. A.H?
detainees have no rights.
remorse and reconciliation.
Oh, that doesn't sound good.
no.
you don't have a clue, do ya?
labyrinth. Do you have a clue, Josefina?
sounds prettier every time I hear it.
you get one free pass.
that was it.
picking up a scent.
sewage?
Yes.
but mixed with the aroma of highly seasoned meat.
pepperoni. No.
sausage.
exhaust from the bunker.
this way.
Shatter-resistant.
shatter-resistant.
Why?
just turn on the a/c?
if by a/c you mean arctic conditions, then yes.
must be 100 degrees in here.
hotter.
we're gonna die.
way to be reassuring, Fargo.
down.
Oh, my god.
B. R.A. D.'S releasing the fire-suppression system.
Argonite.
Yeah. Which means if we don't shut it off, we suffocate.
intruder alert!
Ah, there's my Josefina.
O--or not.
who the hell...?
or what the hell?
with all the time I spent down here, never seen sensor-cams before.
must be linked to the bunker's defense system.
Oh, look at them all.
lucky for us, we're both hunters.
for a moment, there, I thought we were in trouble.
something funny, Henry?
I'm just appreciating the irony of our situation.
which would be what?
well, I'm leaving Eureka because I'm tired of watching noble ideas being turned into weapons, and here we are.
here we are, at the mercy of a weapon that had been turned into a noble idea.
well, that's the way the system works.
one doesn't exist without the other.
spoken like a true bureaucrat.
you know, I'm getting really tired of the remarks, Henry.
no, no, that's true, 'cause you're bailing out on me.
of all my students, you were the one but you chose to do the administrative shuffle.
management, defense contracts, political glad-handing.
I mean, you could've furthered science!
In--in--in so many ways.
but you chose to further your career.
you don't get to do what you do unless someone like me does what I do.
you think it's easy,
I didn't ask to be brought here.
no. Now you're giving up.
but I ignored that, because of my respect for you as a scientist and as a mentor, and as a friend.
idealists don't get much done without a few pragmatists running interference for them.
so, get off your moral high horse.
is the system perfect? No.
it's political and ugly, and compromising.
but in spite of that,
I feel we still do more good than harm, and you, of all people, should appreciate that.
you leave now, Henry, and you're part of the problem, not the solution.
I can't believe I survived holes in time and cold war death rays just to freeze to death in my own damn house, er, bunker.
don't say that, we're going to get out of this.
sure, and then Stark will step in and give everybody permission to do whatever the hell they want.
then it'll all start all over again.
come on, Carter, the whole point of Eureka is to push the envelope.
it's just --the reason I do...
I mean, the reason I chose my job is to make a difference.
I don't think I can do that here.
you have made a difference to a lot of people.
you've made a difference to me.
so, are you just going to leave?
I don't know.
well, for the record, you do what's right, and people admire that, and that's what makes a difference.
I don't want other people's admiration.
what do you want?
but, uh, in the meantime,
I'll settle for you putting your arms around me -I can do that. -Okay.
Oh, crap.
if I'm right, this leads directly to the smart house.
and if you're wrong?
I'll release and unending torrent of raw sewage upon us.
superior species, huh?
there! I got it, I got it, I got it!
you don't. Move.
paint might lube it up.
you've got a better idea?
I do, actually. Yeah.
it's going to take the strength of three men.
I figure you're good for two.
grab my butt, Jo.
sorry about that.
come on Jo, give me some weight.
get ready for stinky.
after you.
no, no. Go ahead.
no, you first. -No, really, I insist, go.
beauty before brawn.
Oh, god! I've got to get out of this dress.
fargo, please, turn around.
okay, sure.
Oh, my god!
fargo, I said please don't look.
you have to hug me. -What?
trust me.
B. R.A. D.'s not trying to torture us.
it's trying to kill us.
no, he's trying to defeat us. Come here.
what are you doing?
B. R.A. D.'s phase ii battle simulations ended in either a complete annihilation or unconditional surrender.
he just had to win.
which means, you and I need to get along.
I--I--I was wrong, Nathan, I'm sorry.
no, Henry, I was wrong.
that's just wrong.
fargo, what are we doing?
making love, not war.
I'm sorry, Fargo, even if we're gonna die, it's never gonna happen.
not literally.
B. R.A. D. We surrender.
I repeat, unconditional surrender.
we're free. -What happened?
phase ii disengages upon unconditional surrender.
well-done, Fargo.
Thanks, Dr. Stark.
that's it? -That's it.
I wish therapy were this easy.
then again, if, uh, everything could really be resolved with a hug , I'd be out of business.
do you hear that?
what's that?
phase iii.
you have surrendered under false pretenses.
I think he heard you.
I'm sorry.
what's happening?
he's extracting our...oxygen.
I'm really sorry.
once oxygen levels fall below 17 percent you'll be experiencing hypoxia, oxygen deprivation.
could we cover the air vents?
Yeah, they'll probably slow down the vacuum, so, grab paper, anything, cover the vents.
this'll work. -No, not my jeremiah harm!
uh, Fargo, you were saying before about cutting off the power?
uh, yeah, that it would be bad cause it would cut off the air supply.
Yeah, seeing as we're all losing air anyway, let's recess that option.
Yes. And we shut down the power, maybe that'll stop B. R.A. D.From sucking out the oxygen.
fargo, where's the generator?
it's not your typical generator.
what the hell is that?
radioisotope thermoelectric generator.
I live with a nuclear reactor?
generator.
the same one they use on the Cassini space probe.
it's clean, safe. -safe.
like, uh, Chernobyl.
right? Why don't we turn the nukie thingy off?
there isn't an off-switch.
conduits are in carbon steel encasements.
if we could access them by shutting it down without the proper tools, we could cause a release of plutonium dioxide.
and--and, uh, Chernobyl, right?
well, technically, no.
lethal, yeah.
I reckon we're right under the bunker.
I didn't even see a camera.
Yeah, well, if you wait 'til you can see them, that means they've seen you.
beauty before beast.
and a beauty she is.
I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.
no, you're not.
no, I'm not. But, uh, thank you for all your bad behavior.
I should've taken advantage of you while I had the chance.
well, if we get out of here...
what's that?
Oh, my god.
it's coming from the floor.
okay.
Thanks.
it's morse code.
Jo and Taggart?
they're in the subsystem.
okay, what--what do we tell 'em?
tell 'em to sever the outtake...conduit.
sever it... -to interrupt the vacuum flow.
you do realize we'll die before I morse all that.
crack. Pipe.
two words I never thought I'd hear from your mouth.
crack pipe.
What's...?
Oh, crack pipe!
okay.
uh, which pipe?
well, pick one.
Oh god, what's that smell?
air flow.
from the bowels of the bunker.
I guess that's why they call 'em the bowels.
we did it! -Good on ya, mate!
intruder alert! -Too late, B.R. A.D.
eliminate intruder.
No!
everybody move.
Carter, what are you do--?
Jack! You could kill yourself!
Carter, are you all right?
Yeah. I'm all right. Is she okay?
I don't know!
S.A.R. A.H? What's going on?
is this some kind of house arrest?
what is that?
it's a diesel generator powering up.
must be the original backup system.
uh, what's happened to Zoe? Show me Zoe.
all right, I know I should have paid for it, but I was in a hurry.
disengage hostile activity. Startup sequence initiated.
Oh, my god.
okay, she's all right.
I feel sick.
I--is it--is it the radiation?
I--I doubt it.
he didn't even crack the housing.
so, no Chernobyl?
uh, nope, you beat the hell out of the R. T.G.
and your, uh, world series' bat.
I can live without that.
dad!
Zoe, don't let the door shut! -Don't let it close!
what's going on?
Oh, so you're allowed to have parties and I'm not?
come here. I thought I almost lost you.
Eureka is still facing imminent disaster.
you all need to stay here and resolve your issues.
what's going on?
I just want you to be happy, sheriff Carter.
do ya?
wait, this isn't a malfunction, is it?
you're angry. You're upset about something.
well, we've all aired our dirty laundry. Time for you to come clean.
I have done all the laundry and folded it as well.
it's not what I'm-- but thank you.
Oh, wait.
you want me to be happy, because I was gonna leave.
huh? Just like Fargo left you, and B. R.A. D. got left before that and then whatever the hell it was before that.
well, it was a war game simulation program.
shall we play a game?
No! No! No! No!
s. A.R. A.H. Is he right?
listen, everyone is afraid of being abandoned.
I mean, I'm afraid of what's gonna happen to this town when Henry leaves.
maybe it'll be a disaster. I don't know.
but I promise you, for right now, I'm not going anywhere.
me either, S. A.R. A.H.
or me.
I guess I'm sticking around.
what about Baja, sheriff?
you kidding?
you know what the crime rate is there?
don't even get me started on soil erosion.
what's up?
I'm gonna have a skylight put in.
and a ladder.
cool.
what about the pop-up artillery outside?
I don't know, what about the shoplifting?
like chocolate bars. Free chocolate bars.
really like being alive.
thing of the past. Swear.
Oh, look at the time!
uh, I gotta get ready for school.
gotta go to work.
relax, Carter. It's a promotion.
you know, sometimes it sucks having a dad who's the town Smokey.
well, sometimes it sucks having a daughter who's the town delinquent.
dog!
I'm Jack Carter.
he's a U. S. Marshal.
I was an engineer. - Trains?
space shuttles.
Allison Blake, Department of Defense.
where are you taking me? - Welcome to Eureka.
a haven where the world's greatest thinkers could live and work.
you must be the new sheriff I heard so much about. Nathan Stark.
you two have a history? - Not exactly. He's my husband.
section Five. Let's go.
we happen to be in the most advanced scientific facility in the world.
we ought to go back to the last remnant of whatever universe existed before our own.
what's happening in there? - I don't know. Systems are offline!
tesla School Class of 2010
you feel that? - Yeah.
Henry, what did you do? - I couldn't let you go.
none of what we've known for the past four years was supposed to happen.
Henry went back and changed history.
we need to stop Henry from saving Kim.
someone's gotta go back.
I love our life. I love this baby.
there's no time, no way, that we don't end up together.
october 3, 2006.
what are you doing here? - I'm stopping you, Henry.
I have to save her. Get the hell out of the way!
No! No!
I think this is definitely becoming a thing.
we don't have a thing.
we might.
we are at marginal proximity now.
no change in core temperature or ambient emissions.
let's proceed.
extreme proximity now.
still no reaction from the Artifact.
moment of truth.
what's happening in there?
I don't know! Systems are offline!
get 'em back online! - I'm trying!
Oh, my God.
I thought I'd find you here.
you're not returning my phone calls.
I didn't feel much like... talking.
you know, you can't keep reliving this, Henry. It's been over a month.
I know. I can't bring Kim back...either.
well, you could. But...not without unraveling the universe, so...
sorry.
look.
you and I are gonna be living with the memory of a timeline that's gone.
I know it's gonna seem impossible.
and, uh...I know it's not gonna happen overnight.
but...I think that you and I should help each other move on.
I mean, don't you?
working on it.
then the Phoenix appears.
the firebird, rising from the ashes.
a mythical symbol of death and rebirth.
mythical is right. Phoenix is about as real as Bigfoot.
history and cultures are chock-a-block with stories of the Phoenix.
its sacrifice to the flames begins our salvation.
lest we suffer the flames ourselves.
so show a little respect, lad.
okay.
another refill, Vincent.
that is my famous five-alarm chili, Wayne.
you may wanna go easy. Try a lobster button.
...I been fighting a cold.
spicy food cleanses the evil spirits.
the hotter the better. - All right.
don't say I didn't warn you.
so why don't you just go talk to him?
I can't.
you know, everything is all weird with us now.
maybe it was just a one-time thing.
you know, adrenaline, heat of the moment.
making out with Taggart?
more like a moment of insanity.
not so loud.
look, I really need some outside perspective here.
please?
you want perspective?
you hooked up with a guy whose age difference with you is the same as me and my dad.
that did it. Thanks. - You're welcome.
you need something, Fargo?
what? Uh, no. I mean, I was, uh, just gonna go get some food.
do you want anything?
I'm good.
okay, then.
I didn't expect to see you here. - Well, I didn't expect to be here.
but my ears finally stopped ringing. I thought I could use the distraction.
well, it's good that you came. - Yeah.
so how are your burns healing?
surprisingly well, actually. My last treatment's tomorrow.
I take it there's no news from the disciplinary committee?
it's the Department of Defense. Nothing happens quickly.
well, it was my call to sample the Artifact.
kim Anderson died as a result.
as did the Artifact.
someone has to take the fall.
Nathan, it was an accident.
let's just wait to see what the results are before we jump to worst-case scenarios.
gonna head back to the lab.
take one last look at the Artifact, just in case.
look, I don't think you should necessarily forget about what happened.
I think it'd be wrong. It'd be horrible.
but I do think that we should look on the positive side.
positive? - Yeah.
like...
like, um, the little things, you know.
for the next four years we're gonna know which movies suck before they even come out.
we're gonna know where bad guys are gonna do bad things before they even happen.
we're gonna know, uh, the outcome to every major sporting event.
huge financial upside.
Jack, I don't think you understand. That life is gone.
we are not likely to relive many of the same events again.
well, I've had this picnic before.
right? As a matter of fact, tonight is the night when I ask Allison out for the first time.
I remember that, because Vincent was right over there making the same lobster balls.
buttons. But...
Oh, whatever...it...
Oh, and, uh, see the sweaty Asian guy here?
he's gonna trip on that kid's hover thing and spill his chili all over that guy's T-shirt.
and I know that, because tomorrow, when I go to the dry cleaners to get my clothes for the first date with Allison, he's gonna be complaining about how the stains didn't come out of his favorite T-shirt.
Yeah!
Jack, you have to take a step back. Granted, some things may occur in a similar way.
but they are going to diverge more and more.
no-- - You lived through four years of a timeline that was erased because you stopped me from doing the thing that created it.
saving Kim.
and the very fact that we're having this conversation means things are going to change.
everybody get ready!
the moment...has arrived.
there she is. The firebird.
well, so far, everything's happened exactly the way it did last time.
including the fact that I still can't see Taggart's crazy firebird.
okay, that's new.
so no one saw what happened?
no, all our eyewitnesses were staring at the sun.
there's not much tissue left, but I can run a DNA sample and get an I. D.
no, I know who it is.
it's, uh, fat, sweaty Asian guy.
what?
I'm being descriptive. If I knew his name, I'd use it.
his name is Kwan. Wayne Kwan.
what? Are you sure?
Yeah, he was on his third bowl of five-alarm chili.
fourth, if you count the one he spilled on Dr. Brock.
you okay? - Yeah, that's Kevin's occupational therapist.
he's been working with him for years.
I don't know how I'm gonna tell Kevin that he's gone.
what's up?
so, what--he get too close to a barbecue?
none nearby.
drop a cigarette?
Wayne was asthmatic. He never touched them.
Vincent...do you have any special ingredients in that five-alarm chili?
like what?
I don't know. Alcohol, rocket fuel.
whatever else you cook up in that chemistry lab you call a kitchen.
I'll have you know I come by my spice naturally.
without a doubt. But that guy ate three bowls of your chili and burst into flames.
so if it's not too much trouble, I'd love a sample.
cool. Help yourself.
any of you wanna test it for me?
it's what I live for.
there is another possibility. - What's that?
Oh, you're not buying into Taggart's crazy firebird fairy tales?
you've got to admit, the timing was a little disturbing.
there are documented incidents of combustion when certain chemicals are exposed to sunlight.
but in this case, most of them would have been in his GI tract.
he also spilled a bowl, so...
so maybe there is something to this Phoenix thing.
fine. Go talk to Taggart. But don't get your hopes up.
talk to Taggart?
by myself?
why, do you have a problem with that?
no, uh...
you just never let me follow up on my own leads.
Jo, you've done this dozens of times over the years.
what years?
well, I...you know.
I mean, no time like the present.
it's, uh...I have every confidence in you.
great.
see? We're not in Kansas anymore.
how's Kevin doing?
I asked Beverly to come over and help him process the news.
Kevin, has your mom told you what happened to Wayne?
he's gone. - Yeah.
Yeah, I'm afraid he is.
how do you feel about that?
will I still see the other man?
what other man?
the man downstairs.
do you know who he's talking about? - No, his sessions were always one-on-one.
Kevin, can you tell me the name of the man?
I don't know.
okay.
I don't wanna push him. It's an awful lot for him to process at one time.
he may even be making up this other man as a defense mechanism.
well, thanks for coming by, Beverly. We really appreciate it.
and...
by "we," I mean... just...all of us.
you know, in Eureka.
it takes a village.
okay. I might be making a lot of house calls in this village today.
I'll see you tomorrow. - Thank you, Beverly.
Hey, it's Carter.
I just talked to Taggart, and he thinks he may know what happened with Wayne.
all right, I'll be right there.
I call it the Phoenix Effect.
when the firebird appears, solar flares emit high-energy exotic meson particles.
under the right atmospheric conditions, you can get spontaneous combustion.
is that human?
of course it is.
freshly-ground skin grafts from the bio-chem burn unit.
now watch.
uni-directional meson particle emitter.
turn up the juice, and...
the Phoenix...rises.
I hate you.
you're welcome. Well, mystery solved.
except why did it only happen to Wayne Kwan?
interesting point.
I'm gonna go shower.
I'm covered in human.
dad, it's been 20 minutes. I need you to take me to the concert.
I'll be out in a minute.
Allison Blake is calling, Sheriff.
Oh, great, put her through!
Oh, yeah, please, take your time!
Hey, Allison, can you hear me?
Yeah. I can do more than hear you.
Oh, sorry, yeah. Hey.
hey? Can you put that away, please?
Oh!
right, um...
s. A.R. A.H. no video phone in the bathroom!
any idea what happened to Wayne Kwan yet?
Henry's testing the chili, and Taggart thinks the fire was caused by an eclipse.
that's impossible. - Yeah.
he has impressive visuals, though.
anything more on the man downstairs that Kevin was talking about?
no, I checked Global.
Wayne wasn't working with anyone else.
I don't know, maybe...
maybe Kevin did make it up.
do you have access to the GD phone records?
Yeah. Why?
well, I figure if we can find out who he was talking to, it might tell us something.
all right, hold on while I pull it up.
all right. Take your time.
okay, you know what? Now you're just mocking me.
drive yourself.
Really? - Yeah, but...
if you're not home by 11: 00, you will be sleeping in a jail cell.
Carter... - I'm not gonna make her sleep in a jail cell.
she's only 15.
right.
which obviously means that you don't have a license.
Yeah, well, I won't tell if you don't.
well, I was testing you. And I'm disappointed. You failed.
Carter, there are a bunch of calls to a chemist. Rob Matthew.
but he works in Section Five.
why would he be talking to Kevin's therapist?
nice place.
Yeah, Section Five guys say they don't get the best houses.
but they do.
well, I live in an underground bunker that has more opinions than my ex-wife.
Hey, I'm thrilled just to have a window.
do you smell smoke?
Dr. Matthew?
is everything okay?
Oh, Carter.
Oh, no.
Dr. Matthew?
guess that would explain why he didn't answer his phone.
you know, if Taggart's right about the Phoenix, everyone could be in danger.
Oh, it's not the stupid Phoenix.
after everything we've seen, how can you say for sure?
well, because Taggart said the combustion was caused by meson particles coming from a solar flare.
I'm no astrophysicist, but I don't think there are a lot of solar flares inside a house.
he's right.
Really?
could you not act so surprised?
think of it as getting a sunburn. The sun's rays burn you from the outside in.
this guy's burned from the inside out.
now, this is where the initial combustion happened.
radiating from here. The frontal lobes.
so their own minds did this to them?
Yeah, it's like a power surge in the body's electrical system.
think of the brain as the microprocessor and the body as the motherboard.
So...then food would be the energy source.
Great--have you tested Vince's chili yet?
digesting the beans in the chili would release methane, which is extremely flammable.
except then, the burning would have started in the GI tract, and not in the brain.
so we're back to they just burst into flames for no apparent reason.
everything has a reason. We just...haven't figured it out yet.
maybe that's the thing we should be looking for.
what's the thing?
well, all this time we've been assuming that it was an accident.
what if someone had a reason to want them to?
that should do it, Dr. Stark.
you can't even see the scars.
Yeah...all better.
time for your monthly Botox injection?
Hello, Sheriff.
Really? ReNo comeback?
just not in the mood.
all right.
there was another fire last night.
this time, we lost a researcher named Rob Matthew.
what the hell's going on?
that's what I'm trying to figure out.
two guys burn to death within eight hours. I'm guessing it's related.
were they working on anything together?
I doubt they even knew each other.
Wayne was an occupational therapist in Section One.
Dr. Matthew studied biotechnology in Section Five.
well, we found a number of interoffice phone calls between them.
they must be talking about something.
can't imagine what it would be.
I'm gonna need a list of names. Anyone they have contact with.
friends, family, coworkers, enemies, all of it.
you think someone did this to them?
when something seems too coincidental, it usually is.
Dr. Stark is one of the finest scientists Eureka has ever known.
and I think that his past contributions should be considered in your review.
yet the fact remains that Dr. Stark's decision to sample the Artifact cost millions of dollars in damage, and the life of another of Eureka's finest scientists.
Eureka is a place where we push the boundaries of human understanding every day.
and it is hypocritical to punish Dr. Stark for doing his job.
are you speaking as a D. O.D. liaison or his wife?
ex-wife.
and I believe that my track record shows that our personal history has never interfered with my professional judgment.
given the magnitude of this incident,
I'm afraid the committee has no choice but to appoint a new head of Global Dynamics, effective immediately.
why would anyone want to kill them in such a public way?
Oh, I don't know.
I guess that's where this thing called investigating comes in.
look, I need to know who they work with and what kind of research they were doing.
what's wrong?
trouble logging in. System error.
sure you have access?
there's nothing in this facility I don't have access to.
Hey, Allie. - Cart--um, Allie?
I'm trying something a little less formal.
I'd prefer you didn't.
so would I.
I can't get in the database. Any idea what's wrong?
Yes.
the committee has reached a decision.
and you're the messenger?
I'm sorry, Nathan.
have they found my replacement yet?
actually, they have.
anyone I know. - Yes.
me.
this isn't right. I'll say.
thanks for the vote of confidence.
no, I didn't mean that. I just-- - I defended you, Nathan.
looks like you defended me right into a promotion for you.
the only reason you're not being redacted and escorted to the city limits is because of me.
so I should be thanking you?
guys, bigger issues-- - Damn right you should be.
you were obsessed with the Artifact, and it cost Kim's life.
I mean, what did you expect?
I don't know.
not this.
good luck, Allison. - Nathan, uh...
fine. What do we do?
well, we cross-check anyone Wayne Kwan or Rob Matthew had in common, to see if they were targeted.
you okay?
Yeah, let's just, um...
let's just find those names. - Sure.
I don't know if this helps, but I believe things work out the way they're supposed to.
you just have to have a little faith.
Yeah, well...
I don't have a lot of faith these days.
g-go back. I know that guy.
that's the guy Wayne spilled his chili on yesterday.
Ryan Brock, biotech, Section Five.
he worked with Dr. Matthew.
What'd they work on?
the origins of the Artifact.
that thing's been nothing but trouble.
tell me about it.
I've seen him somewhere else too.
Hi, this is Allison Blake. Can you send Dr. Brock up to see me, please?
Really? When?
okay, thank you.
he left for the day. With a fever.
good afternoon, Dr. Stark. - Good afternoon.
red FLAG: ACCESS DENIED - Is there a problem? - Sorry, sir.
for some reason your access is coming up denied.
well, I'm pretty sure it's me. Why don't you just perform an override?
regulations require special authorization for that, sir.
and who would you get that special authorization from?
you.
gotta love the irony.
Hey, Jo, it's Carter. You copy?
Lupo. What's up? Over.
keep your eye out for a Dr. Ryan Brock. He's gonna be driving...a black Subaru Forester.
What'd Brock do? - More was done to him.
just like Wayne and Matthew. We might have We're gonna go to his house right now.
got it. Over.
wait, the...
Wayne. Scratch that. We're gonna stop at the dry cleaner.
wait, wait-- how do you know that?
well, I bumped into Brock at the dry cleaner the day we had our first, uh...
first what?
nothing.
I just know.
day CLEANERS - It's Brock. - Damn, what's he doing over there?
Dr. Brock! Hey, uh, yeah. Glad we could catch up with you. You okay?
he's burning up. Call the paramedics.
actually, I'm not feeling so hot.
maybe get a fire extinguisher. - Yeah.
fire extinguisher? What's happening to me here?
we don't know, but it's the same thing that happened to Wayne Kwan and Rob Matthew.
rob too? - Yeah.
Oh, no. - Yeah, who would wanna do this to you?
I don't know. - Take a seat.
everyone, clear this area--now! Allison!
over here, this way.
Carter, you tried to save him. - I screwed up.
if I'd been... a little sooner, I...
I'm having trouble keeping the times straight. Everything's changed.
what are you talking about? What's changed?
no, just...something Henry was saying.
what about him?
that's where I've seen Brock before.
Oh, man.
what's up?
that's what I'm trying to find out. And I...sincerely hope I'm wrong.
about what?
could you run the hologram?
Just--there's something I need to see.
I thought you wanted me to to leave it off. Move on and all that.
I did, but I just realized what our victims have in common.
So...turn it on. Please.
stop it there.
it's them. It's Brock and Matthew.
Hey, look at that.
you're telling me you didn't know?
Yeah. What are you saying?
I'm saying that everybody in this room could be held responsible for Kim's death.
I ruled out the accident. I ruled out the eclipse.
I ruled out the chili, or should I say, you did.
you think I'm capable of murder?
well, you risked the universe for her once.
what, is it really that different?
taking a risk and taking a life are two very different things!
and I am incapable of the latter.
Really? Even for Kim?
especially for Kim!
what are you working on over there?
not what you think.
well, knowing the lengths you went to last time to bring her back, what do you think I think?
even if I did blame those men, what motivation could I possibly have to kill Kevin's therapist?
he wasn't even there!
you're right.
unless he was. We can see everybody in the room.
just...
can you fast forward this for a second? Please.
you don't have to watch it. - Yes, I do.
okay, stop it there.
can you jump forward and show me the other side of the room?
okay.
this might be a stupid question, but what exactly killed her?
a concentrated burst of particulate radiation.
like--like a-- - A shotgun blast.
shotgun.
what's on the other side of this wall?
another lab. You'll have to look at a building schematic--why?
my first year as a marshal, I tracked this guy down to a hotel.
I kick in the front door.
he comes out of the bathroom firing, just barely missing me.
but the woman in the next room wasn't so lucky.
stray bullet. - Yeah.
we have to find out if someone was on the other side of that wall.
does this mean you believe me now?
it doesn't matter what I believe.
but the lab behind the blast wall
well, not that we know of. Keep scrolling.
the radiation from the Artifact is unlike anything we've seen before.
we don't have equipment sophisticated enough to measure it.
which means that some of it could have passed through the wall undetected.
there, just, now--who--who works in that lab?
Dr. Matthew.
who was exchanging frequent phone calls with Kevin's therapist.
can you tell if anyone was in there at the time of the accident?
Yeah, uh, each lab in Section Five has a biometric security scanner.
I can pull up the entry log.
I can't believe it. It's Wayne.
and look at the time code. He should have been in therapy with Kevin.
what was he doing in there?
he was visiting the man downstairs.
my God, Kevin could have been in there with him.
wait, where is he now?
in session with Beverly, Section One.
Jack, there was someone else in the chamber.
Nathan is the last man standing.
well, he won't be for long. - I'll have security help you find him.
get him to cryogenics while there's still time.
everything looks fine.
but we'll keep him under observation just to be on the safe side.
thank you.
they found Dr. Stark.
can you watch him, please?
we have to cool him down.
I was so close. So close to understanding.
Nathan, stay with me.
Nathan. - He's overloading, like the others.
it looks like a massive seizure. - It is.
from what?
exposure to the Art-- - Henry! That's classified.
his temperature's up to 104.
okay, the seizure's frying his electrical system.
we--can we shut it down?
you shut down his system, he dies.
well, not the whole thing. Just bit of it that's misfiring.
you know, like tripping a breaker.
maybe we can. - How?
fight fire with misfire. Jack is right.
we don't have to shut down the circuit, we just have to disrupt it.
great. How do we do it?
electroshock therapy. - No!
small silver box. - Got it.
they used electroshock therapy very effectively to disrupt seizure disorder.
Yes, in dealing with epilepsy.
but we have no idea how that will affect what's going on inside of his head!
and we don't have time to fight about it!
he's right.
are you sure?
please don't burst into flames.
I'll do my best.
all right, hang in there. - Oh, Sheriff. Didn't know you cared.
Oh, I don't.
you ready? - Henry...
I'm sorry about Kim.
I know.
how are you feeling?
Oh, like someone microwaved my brain. But besides that...
well, your fever topped 106-- we were all...
really worried.
me burst into flames?
I'm not giving the D. O.D. the satisfaction.
I really am sorry, Nathan.
don't be.
they made the right choice.
you mean that? - Absolutely.
after everything that's happened, I don't think I could do the job anymore.
you might be just what this place needs.
this place still needs you too.
well...
I should probably let you get some rest.
Nathan, can I ask you something? - Sure.
what was Kevin's therapist doing in a lab in Section Five?
I wish I knew.
Hey, Henry. - Jack.
I hear, um... Nathan's on the mend.
Oh, sure, rub it in.
Allie has thatook. Had--had that book. In the other timeline.
you okay? - No, you're right.
every time I try to make things happen with Allie the way they did before, the more they change.
tonight was supposed to be our firs.
stark was supposed to take the job in San Francisco.
and instead, she's holding his hand, convincing him to stay.
and, uh...
sorry I suspected you.
you were just... following your instincts.
Yeah. Which were all wrong.
I mean...
I thought it would be easier this time around.
I thought, uh, it'd be fun, you know. Like I could do things better.
Yeah, um...instead, uh, a man died.
and I accused you of murder.
and the woman I love is slipping away.
I-I don't know if I can do this.
maybe you don't have to.
What--what is that?
it's a modified version of the memory neutralizer that I designed years ago.
the original was like a shotgun, erasing short-term memory.
this one erases long-term memory, but is much more precise.
you wanna erase your memory from the other timeline?
I want to erase our memories.
Jack. You're my closest friend.
and intellectually, I know that you had to prevent me from saving Kim, but emotionally, I blame you for her death.
I can't look at you without thinking that you're the one who did this, that you're the one who took her away from me.
I wish there had been another choice. - I know.
but the pain that I feel every day that she'sot here, the--the pain that you feel knowing that you're not gonna be with Allison, that you're not gonna be meeting the child that you were having together.
this takes all that away.
can we keep some of the memories?
cause there was this one time with Allison
Jack. I'm afraid it has to be all or nothing.
you're really gonna do this? - We have to.
and who will go first? - I'll make it easy for you.
I hear Nathan's on the mend.
Oh, sure. Rub it in.
my head is killing me.
you okay? - Yeah.
what...
sonnlts - Can I borrow this? - Sure.
I'll see you later. - I'll see you later.
and I will never forget.
good morning, Allison.
Henry. You look nice.
going for a job interview?
actually, I am.
I, uh, I wanna work at Global Dynamics.
congressman Faraday.
according to Nathan Stark, the Artifact appears to be dead.
that isn't possible. - I said "appears."
energy of that magnitude doesn't just die.
it had to go somewhere.
Kevin, honey, dinner's ready.
come on, baby.
I want to continue Kim's research.
so you think you can put this tragedy behind you?
never.
according to Nathan stark, the artifact appears to be dead.
energy of that magnitude doesn't just die.
it had to go somewhere.
how 'bout, this saturday night, you, me, Ribs, root beer, and ESPN classic?
they're showing the Lakers game we went to around your ninth birthday.
it was my sixth. - Yeah.
actually, I was thinking more like red bull and pizza at Pilar's house.
cause, um, it's your birthday, so I figured it would be great to do something together.
just the two of us. - Yeah.
that's nice, but-- um, you know, I'm turning 16, not 60.
which still qualifies you as a minor. Wearing that doesn't qualify as a shirt, so...
put on a Jacket.
we're in the middle of a heat wave.
today's forecast calls for heat, frost, rain, hail, gale force winds, and severe lightning.
I'll have Fargo give her a checkup.
you know, I just-- I wanna do something normal.
like a party with my friends.
I think I liked it better when you were six.
Hey, Pilar.
what are you doing?
dad, what-- - hey, sheriff.
Bye, sheriff.
Oh, Pilar, just so you know, Zoe already has plans for her birthday.
bummer. - Yeah, bummer.
okay, enough mortification.
have a great day!
I'll remember this when you're getting arrested on dateline.
nice. No, we're planning-- a surprise party.
Hey, Kevin. What is, uh, november 3, 1957?
Tuesday.
Oh, pretty sure it was a thursday.
Nope. Tuesday.
whatever. Still gonna look it up.
have a good day, sweetie. Good luck.
he's in a great mood.
Yeah, he's been, uh, different recently.
like he's opening up.
that's great.
isn't it? - Yeah. Of course.
can we-- - Yeah. Yeah.
so are you gonna come to Zoe's surprise party?
Oh, me? I thought you were into young brunettes.
no, no. I'm into old bru
that didn't come out right, did it? - No. No.
well, we got a D. J.
and you really haven't lived until you've seen me dance to "hips don't lie."
well, you're on, old man.
you wanna get a cup of coffee?
I got a meeting.
but, um, you can ask me again.
whoa, you'd better-- - um, yeah.
morning!
okay, it's been six months.
since months since what?
six months since you said we would discuss my promotion in six months.
Jo, there's no official position between yours and mine.
great. I'll take yours.
Nah, today you're not gonna bother me.
today is a great day for Jack Carter.
Zoe has no idea about her surprise party, and I have a rain check for a coffee date.
you said you'd make a call to D. C. for special consideration.
but you're not very good at doing things that you don't really want to do.
tell you what.
because everything's going so well for me and because I'm such an amazing guy,
I will make the call right now.
Hello?
maybe it's a sign.
I think the Gods are angry with you.
and what makes you think that they're not angry at you?
Oh, because I'm an amazing guy.
what are you doing here?
well, that's a nice way to welcome your ex-wife.
could have given me a heads up.
it's her 16th birthday. You could have given me an invitation.
thank you, sheriff Lupo.
it's deputy. - Deputy.
until your husband chooses to promote me.
uh, ex. And I said I'd make the call.
Jack doesn't like doing things Jack doesn't wanna do.
tell me about it.
phones are back.
you look good, Jack.
does she know you're coming?
you look good, too, Abby.
come on.
you do.
it's just-- - you hate surprises.
Yeah, well, especially when I don't know they're coming.
Yeah, well, look, Jack, we had an agreement, and it's been a year.
I just assumed we'd talk about it again. - Okay, fine, let's talk.
deputy.
rub it in. There's been an accident at the spa.
Eureka has a spa? - Yeah. It's a fission-powered hot spring.
it's members only. There's been a...malfunction.
can you check it out?
Abby and I are gonna go...
for coffee.
Thanks.
nothing would make me happier. Sir.
Hey, sheriff. - Hey, guys.
morning, sheriff. - Morning.
did you see them? Just like...
clones.
very similar.
why is it only raining over there?
pacific northwest.
look, um, Zoe loves it here.
she couldn't be happier, and she's really thriving.
I think it's the best thing we could have done for her.
you sure that that's her perception and not yours?
don't do that. - What?
the shrink thing you do where you make, you know, you sound like you're the better parent.
it's called insecurity, and it stems from the person listening, not the person speaking.
and remind me again why I used to think it was fun to fight with you.
because you like a challenge.
with these unstable pressure systems,
I predict a whopper of a storm is coming our way.
I'm Pete Puhlman for storm watch.
so, I thought I'd stay a week, and we'd have a party and we'd still have a couple of days before Zoe and I
my special double yolk quail egg omelet with Estonian caviar and basil grafted from an Italian monastery.
Thanks, Vincent.
Oh, my god. Is that truffle oil?
Yes!
finally, a refined palate.
the last time I served it to him, he asked for ketchup.
on the house.
except for the muffin.
this day is shaping up.
look at those two.
Oh, now I just feel sick.
Hey, what a surprise. - Hate surprises.
meeting, huh? - Brunettes, huh?
I was just telling Jack what a striking couple you are.
well, thank you. - Oh, thank you.
and you are... - Oh, Jack's evil ex-wife, Dr. Abby Carter.
Dr. Allison blake.
Dr. Nathan stark.
all these doctors. Your worst nightmare, Jack.
he used to hate it when I dragged him around to my alumni functions.
he called it death by dull.
he is very clever.
so, uh, will you be staying at the house?
no. - Yes.
we're, uh, setting her up at Beverly'S.
well, um, then I guess I'll see you at Zoe's party.
I hear there'll be dancing.
Oh, Jack and I won a Macarena Contest in Cabo once. Remember that, Jack?
I can't wait for the party.
you may think you've put the past behind you, but...
these things take time.
the heart doesn't heal overnight.
nor should it.
that's why it's important to find constructive ways to work through the pain.
which is precisely why I want to continue Kim's research.
is that the only reason?
does it matter?
when you're asking to work at the most advanced research facility on the planet,
I'm afraid it does matter.
and does everybody at G. D.Fall under this level of scrutiny?
of course.
including Kim.
were you seeing Kim?
on and off.
more during the months leading up to her...
to the accident.
but you never talked about her research.
up to a point. My security level doesn't cover section five projects.
but she told me what she could.
so you never visited her lab.
no.
right.
sorry. - Go ahead. We're done.
same time tomorrow? - Absolutely.
yeah?
hot, yeah? - Yeah. So I've noticed.
it's crazy.
I come to turn on the nuclear bubbles, and look what I see.
What--what is this?
my first big case.
so is Zoe excited at all?
uh, yeah. Yeah, sure, I guess.
you guess.
Abby, we should talk. - Oh, god, Jack.
I never thought it was settled.
you didn't tell her. - I assumed we were gonna talk about it.
we had an agreement. - That was before.
before what?
before probably the greatest year of my life.
and when were you planning on sharing this with me?
I don't know.
the next time you called.
I didn't plan on you just showing up.
God, Jack, you know, you've had a year. This is just like you.
this is so unfair. It's-- it's snowing.
what is it with this place?
I-- Hold on.
Yeah, Jo, it's not a good time right now. It's, uh...
snowing.
what?
did-- did you call Henry?
okay. I'll be there as soon as I get Abby settled. Thanks.
Abby is not settling this time, Jack.
I didn't close the spa.
I've got sciatica, and no one's ever told me about this place?
it's on G. D.Property, Carter.
you guys don't belong here. Employees only.
we're here on official business.
the grotto closure. Yeah, inconvenient.
at least Alma's still giving shiatsu.
you have shiatsu?
Carter, over here.
is that embroidered?
membership has its privileges.
you mean those brainiacs use a nuclear reactor to heat their whirlpools?
not the reactor. Just the byproduct from the core cooling system.
this is a byproduct of a cooling system?
flash freezing? Not likely.
well, we'd better get an I. D.
okay...
which piece do we start with?
still think these nuclearhot tubs are safe?
Yeah, but you see what happens when they changethe natural order of things?
I mean, everything's under control, then somebody throws a wrench in something that's working perfectly fine for unselfish reasons.
then your life is shattered, and she's blaming you.
what?
are we still talkingabout the reactor?
Yeah.
what?
okay, so how are we gonnaget an I. D.Now?
just look fora finger.
how 'bout a...
a thumb?
you sure that's a thumb?
only if it has a print.
Baxter, neil. G.D. Employee. Number 185627.
it's a thumb.
I can't explain the death.
scientifically, the reactor just doesn't make sense.
I mean, if the hot spring shad boiled, I'd say, you know, maybe there was a leak.
well, Henry mentioned something aboutthe cooling system?
which doesn't go below 20 degrees. Skiing weather.
okay, so like the snowat Beverly'S.
I don't know, Carter. Why don't you look into it?
unless you're too busy with personal matters.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
did I miss something?
I-I just want to get this figured out as quickly as possible.
Oh, my god. You're jealous.
of?
what do you think?
Oh, please.
come on. You have nothing to worry about.
I'm not worried.
you know what, let's just stay focused on work so we can avoid these awkward moments.
these awkward moments are the only social lifeI have left.
check this out.
this was Baxterthe frozen guy's lab.
I've been filling in sometimes.
Baxter was conducting a real-time field study on the mating habitsof a tribe in Tanzania.
see those two?
it's Danny and Sandy. They've been together since they were teenagers.
how about the jumpy one?
he's been like that since he hooked up with Katie.
exactly how much time have you spent down here, Fargo?
Baxter put upa live webcast every day to poll viewer reaction to the relationship dynamics.
better than the bachelor.
was he working withanyone else?
I wouldn't call it working.
he was known to doa lot of field testing with the female lab techs, if you know what I mean.
gave new meaning to the term wild monkey
please stop that.
new priority email message from: "unknown" "sender for your eyes" "only access restricted enter password" "Dr. Nathan Stark" a total mystery to me.
I'm scared, Henry.
in three days, Zoe turns 16.
any man who say she understands women is either naiveor a liar.
well, apparently, Baxter did. He was the Casanova of section three.
I've questioned six women who thought he was god's gift to their gender, even when there wasn't enough of him to go around.
well, therecertainly is now.
what did Allison say?
she doesn't think it was the reactor.
she's right.
the cooling system could not possibly create a temperature that low to freeze tissue that fast unless we were into China syndrome times five.
well, I have Jo retracing his last day.
it's gonna take mea little time to get you an accurate time of death.
I have to wait for this tissue to thaw.
Yeah, or we could just read his watch.
got 12... - 26
you know, if we werethat smart about women, - Yeah.
Oh, no, what time-- Zoe.
OOP. - Yep. Got it.
so...
what's the one next to mercury?
gold.
every girl's favorite element.
that's my mom.
you didn't tell me.
I wanted to surprise you.
I hate surprises.
you're just like your dad.
we've got so much to talk about. Come on.
Hey, sweetie. I thought I'd swing by and pick you up
she promised-- No, it's terrific!
I mean, yeah, surprise! Just, um...
don't talk to her till I get there.
all right. Bye.
okay, I give up. So where do you live?
in there.
both of you? - It's underground.
well, that makes so much more sense.
Hi, Jack. - Hi, dad.
Hi.
what are you doing? I asked you to wait.
has she spoken to you? - What?
you told her.
no, Jack-- - This is so like you!
you're just tearing-- - whatever's good for you.
stop judging me
I'm gonna look like the bad guy just because you want to come here and take away my kid.
what are you talking about?
you didn't tell her. - No.
but you just did.
can someone just treat me like a person and tell me what's going on?
your mom and I had an agreement when you came to live here.
what kind of agreement?
I just wanted us to be a family.
just you and me, you know...
with no time limit.
but there was a time limit.
it was a year, and then you were supposedto come back to L. A.with me.
and you were supposed to tell her. - Don't blame this on me.
okay, that's enough. This isn't about either of you, okay?
you've already ruined your own lives. Just leave mine alone.
Zoe
what is happening?
get inside!
s. A. R. A. H. Door!
what the hell was that?
that would be a severe dust storm precipitated by unstable pressure systems.
what the hell was that?
that--that was, uh, the house.
Abby, house. House, Abby.
this is that Abby?
your house talks to you? - Yeah.
listen, Zoe-- - I'm going to my room.
sweetie, wait, wait. We have to talk about this.
just give her some space.
Oh, so now you're the expert. - Yeah. I am.
she's a different kid. And I'm a different parent than I was a year ago.
and I know I was awful, but you gotta cut me some slack while I figure out why we almost ended up in Kansas.
Look--hey, uh, S. A. R. A. H.
you said that we were infor some freaky weather today. How'd you know that?
I receive weather updates every quarter hour from the Eureka channel.
from the weather guy?
Mr. Puhlman prefers meteorologist.
he's a little sensitive about it. - Okay. I gotta talk to him.
no, no, you have to talk to me and our daughter.
I know, and I will--I just have to deal with this first.
and, no, I can't go into it.
sure. Go to work. Your favorite hiding place.
you're much shorter than I pictured you, Abby.
a volatile storm system is taking us to level yellow, so everyone is strongly encouraged to stay indoors.
the cumulator 2100 is predicting high winds, sporadic down pours, and more froston Socrates avenue.
so keep it tuned to storm watch, because we're in for one wild ride, folks.
I'm Pete Puhlman.
sorry about that.
emergency updates all day long. - Yeah.
how can I help you, sheriff? - I don't know.
I'm hoping you can tell me what the hell's going on with the weather.
Yeah, no problem. - Okay.
see...
cumulator 2100.
it's the most sophisticated meteorological predictor in the industrialized world.
if I had a nickel for every time I'd heard that...
continue.
it all began with a severe temperature drop last night over the hot springs which precipitated a chain reaction of unstable pressure systems.
the rain downtown, the snow on the north side, the dust storm, all
Yeah. All caused by the initial drop in pressure. Watch.
the pressure drop began here.
by the time it hit the hot springs, insta-freeze.
so the freaky weather didn't cause the freeze.
the freeze causedthe freaky weather.
exactly.
okay, so the question is what's there?
Hi, Allison. - Hi, Beverly.
this is, uh, crazy weather, huh? - I know.
I appreciate you coming.
I'm always happy to come to the office for a session.
actually, I didn'tcall you here for me. It's Henry.
I need him cleared to work at G. D.
well, our sessions are going well.
I think maybe in another few weeks
I'm afraid I can't wait that long.
Henry's in a fragile state of mind, Allison. He's not ready.
I'd like to help you out, but I have to put him first.
I'm afraid in good conscience I can't sign off on this.
all right.
then I'll do it myself.
it's me.
Henry Deacon is being cleared to return to global.
I know.
I'm coming in for a debriefing. We need to strategize.
Jo, I sent you a picture with a map... - got it.
I need you to check out what's there. - Did it.
I think it's a pretty good lead. - Good lead. I know.
so if you let medo my job for a change-- emphasis on change
Jo, I have enough women who are mad at me today.
I found a cabin.
what? Where?
right smack-dab in the middle. And it's owned by Dr. Steven Whiticus.
and you'll never guess who was the last personto call Baxter the night he died.
well, no. Um, his wife. Wendy.
Baxter was field testing the wife?
maybe the husband found out and, you know, crime of passion.
okay. I'll check outthe cabin. You check out the doctor.
she's gone, Jack. She ran away.
what?
it's just like before.
all right, did she take anything with her?
no, she just--she left the house by herself.
well, she does that all the time.
I mean, she's not gone, Abby. She's 16.
Yeah, but how do you know for sure? - Because I do. I know her.
she wouldn't run away. Not like that. Not anymore.
Oh, so I'm the only parent that she runs away from. Is that what you're saying?
I'm not saying that.
what I am saying is that things have changed.
you haven't changed, Jack.
you've always put your work before us.
that's why she started running away to begin with.
okay.
let's go.
what?
look, I have to work, so if you wanna talk, you have to come with me.
see? Change.
I'll call from Whiticus's cabin.
she's still not answering.
it's because she's still pissed.
and whose fault is that?
Oh, well, mine, obviously.
because everything badt hat happens would be my fault.
well, I wouldn't say everything bad.
she'll call when she's ready. - Yeah.
that's her. - Good.
Hey, sweetie, thanks for calling. We really app--yeah.
Yeah. Y-yeah, you're right.
I was wrong.
so
what did she say?
she's fine.
she never wants to talk to either one of us again. But she's fine.
she's spending the night at a friend of hers.
Pilar's. Nice girl, actually. Good influence.
I think you'd like her.
wait here. I'm gonna go take a look around.
welcome to Eureka.
so you were the last person to see neil Baxter alive last night.
relationships are so complicated.
I mean...
I love my husband.
he's a brilliant man.
it's just that, uh, neil gave me something I haven't had for so long.
Passioncan be so powerful.
okay, so you two were together for how long last night?
at the cabinuntil about midnight.
and then I drove home and neil went to the hot springs.
he always liked to soak after...
come take a look at this!
Mrs. Whiticus.
I'm going to have to ask your husband some questions.
darling, look.
a typhoon.
that was crazy, huh?
the--the storm. Yeah.
so you wanna talk about it?
it's been such a hard year, Jack, you know, all by myself.
and I've been thinking about so many things, you know?
like how we got to this place after 15 years.
I miss Zoe so much.
and I hate to admit it, but I missed you too.
are you even listening to what I'm saying?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just give me a sec.
unbelievable.
what the hell?
yeah...
does this look like a crazy weather machine to you?
Oh, like I would know?
good point. Hold on.
Hey, Jo, it's me。
I'm out at Whiticus's cabin. I think I found something.
Yeah. I've been trying to get a hold of you.
I found something in his basement.
he's created mini-climates using some kind of microwave technology.
any chance it looks like a...
big, scary satellite dish?
Yeah, based on the schematics.
Yeah. And, uh, if what I'm seeing down here is any indication of what you're gonna see out there, it's gonna bea bumpy night.
well, keep him there. I'm on my way over.
look, Abby, I'm-- - I know.
can we talk about it another time?
no need. Just, um...
just take me home.
I think I've seen enough.
think I'm gonna have to take you in for questioning.
what?
Dr. Whiticus, you're under arrest for the murderof neil Baxter.
I don't understand.
please, you're making a mistake.
he can't leave the house.
so you found out Baxter and your wife were having an affair, and you froze him with a giant microwave
okay, stop!
he couldn't have killed anyone.
he's practically blind.
his eyes are too sensitiveto leave the house, even at night.
we have special lights, filters on all the windows.
could have had an accomplice.
why would I want to kill the man who finally brought happiness to my wife?
Hey, look who made it for pizza.
there's not gonna be any pizza.
come on, sweetie.
can you wait for mommy in the car?
what's going on, Allie?
Nathan, I'm going to ask you a question, and I swear, if you lie to me...
I'm listening.
I know about kb-201.
I really wanted to tell you. - Tell me what?
that you only brought my son here to study him?
that you put his life at risk?
the only reason we studied him is to make sure his life isn't at risk.
what are you talking about?
Kevin has a connection to the artifact.
he draws pictures. He makes models.
he knows exact geometric details.
we've been trying to understand why.
he has been different ever since that accident in section five.
he was down there, and you didn't tell me!
Allie, I would never put him in harm's way.
you have to know that.
I don't know anything anymore, Nathan.
get in the car.
Where'd this come from?
make it stop!
it's okay, baby.
make it stop. Make it stop.
it's okay, baby. It's gonna pass.
make it stop!
please tell me what's happening.
I don't know yet.
you knew about the affair?
well, my eyes may not work very well, but...
doesn't mean I'm totally blind.
I always knew I wasn't enough for Wendy, even before the accident.
the glasses help you see.
infrared wi-fi signal lets them augment the little bit of retinal usage that I retain.
the...
array thing we found at the cabin.
could that have caused the frost?
well, I designed it to refreeze the melting polar ice caps, to bring rainto drought-plagued nations.
but there were calibration problems that I was working to fix.
that's what led to my accident.
I decided to stop the project because it was too dangerous, and I didn't want it to harm anyone else.
would Wendy?
what possible reason would she have to want to hurt anyone?
she was at the cabinthat night.
and she wasn't Baxter'sonly...
experiment.
you know, jealousy is a very powerful
you said the device went off at 12: 26. - Yeah.
but I called her the minute I heard the frost predicted on the news.
she was home by midnight.
the 11: 00 news with Pete what's-his-name?
the weatherman. - Meteorologist.
he's pretty touchyabout it. - Yeah.
well, Peter'salways been very touchy.
he was part of the dish installation team.
he's always cravedthe limelight.
still, if he hadn't havepredicted the ice storm, I guess
Yeah, then maybeit wouldn't have happened.
Jo, can you watch him?
Hey, allison. It's Carter. Meet me at the tv station.
Hey, Pete, it's getting pretty nasty out there.
you have any good news for us?
well, it's a category four ice storm, which will reach full strength in the next...
few hours.
it must bea weatherman's dream.
my job is to servethe community, which you should be evacuating, sheriff.
because this will bea direct hit.
it's amazing how accurately you've predicted each hit.
I know.
my cumulator technology is very precise.
Yeah!
when you predicted that ice storm at 11: 18, we were in the middle of a heat wave.
who would have thought an hour later you could be ice skatingon the hot springs?
apparently, not neil Baxter. - Yeah.
his death was tragic.
if he'd only seen my forecast, maybe it could have been prevented.
or maybe it could have been prevented if somebody hadn't turned on the, weather dish death machine while he was soaking in the grotto.
are you referring to Dr. Whiticus's climate dish array?
you think that's what caused all this? - Pretty sure.
I warned him.
I warned him that it was reckless to continue his research.
honestly, that thing should be destroyed.
that'd be a relief to you, huh?
Why--why would I
well, if Whiticus can control the weather, then there's not much need for a weatherman, is there?
I had nothing to do-- - you started the storm so you could be a hero, and Whiticus's research could be shut down once and for all.
you can't prove that. - Actually, I can.
we found footprints by the dish.
odd thing, though--there was no tread.
now, who would wear dress shoes to tramp around in the woods after midnight?
huh, Pete?
now, why don't you save us the trouble of matching our prints to your shoes and help us stop this thing.
now, I never
I never meant to--to hurt anyone.
I mean, I didn't even know that Wendy and Baxterwere out there.
I'm not a killer, sheriff.
I-I'm just
I'm so tired of no one taking me seriously as a scientist in this town.
I mean, it works. My technology is the vanguard.
well, it won't matter if the storm wipes out the town.
and we only have a few hours to save it.
level 5 warning
Yeah...make that one hour.
it's been building since last night.
it is an incredibly dangerous confluence of meteorological events.
a perfect storm.
thank you.
a spinning cyclone of instability high up intocryosphere.
ice funnel of death. - Gotcha.
why don't you people just say"ice funnel of death"?
how is this happening so far from the ocean?
like Archimedes.
because of all the volatility in the area, it's providing enough coldmoisture for the storm to brew, and it's happening fast.
this is tomorrow.
and there's no way to stop it?
well, warm tropical currents could counteract an event like this, but we're nowhere nearan El Nino.
I might have to evacuate the town.
no, there's no time. We might end up with a bunch more frozen Baxters.
look, all we need is warm water, right?
if your dish thing could freeze the hot springs, could it heat a lake?
theoretically, i-it could. But it doesn't have the range.
presumably, it's attached to a mainframe somewhere in the cabinet.
Yeah. It's attached underneath the house. It heats the house.
it's an environmentally conscious design.
well, that's it.
the lake is the water source for the hot springs, right?
linked to the reactor by an underground aquifer.
so you crank up the juice at G. D.
and we build some steam.
and I guess I get my raincoat.
Hey, how's it looking on your end?
we're at 850 degrees celsius. Are you there yet?
Yeah. But not for long.
inside the main control panel of the dish array is an override switch.
you need to manually aim the dish directly at the lake to get it to flash boil the water.
if it evaporates too slowly, we only strengthen the hurricane.
so no pressure.
timing is critical.
you need to activate the dish when we reach1, 000 degrees celsius to hit the flash boil point.
found the override. Where do I aim it?
you need to dial it 60 degrees to the northeast.
we're at 975 degrees.
got it!
No!
almost there. You ready?
hang on!
we're at 1, 000 degrees!
you have to do it now! - I'm trying!
how hard is itto push a button?
you wanna do it? - Carter!
he did it. Carter, are you okay?
Carter? Say something.
I want a raise.
like they think this is a solution, bouncing me back and forth.
well, who would you choose?
I mean, if you had to.
your mom or your dad?
well, if they loved me, they wouldn't make me. But...
right now I'm just so mad at my dad for lying to me.
well, you know, sometimes peoplehave good reasons for lying.
there is no good reason for lying.
surprise!
I hate surprises.
any job offers?
Yeah, a few.
I heard 17.
it would be crass to count.
just so you know, I traced the emailon kb-201.
I know you sent it.
I just wanted what was best for Kevin.
give me one second.
Henry, I've arranged for everything to be unsealed tomorrow
kim's section five records, all of her data.
Oh, thanks. It-- it means a lot to me.
me too.
thank you.
so has she said anything to you?
not a word. - Me neither.
but it really is a really nice party. - Yeah.
I'm glad she's having fun.
Mr. and Mrs. Macarena.
I really hate him.
so what do we do now?
what do you want to do?
I don't know.
well, then Zoe and I will go back to L. A. and...
and when you do, you'll know where to find us.
I want to continue Kim's research.
so you think you can put this tragedy behind you?
never.
according to Nathan stark, the artifact appears to be dead.
energy of that magnitude doesn't just die.
it had to go somewhere.
how 'bout, this saturday night, you, me, Ribs, root beer, and ESPN classic?
they're showing the Lakers game we went to around your ninth birthday.
it was my sixth. - Yeah.
actually, I was thinking more like red bull and pizza at Pilar's house.
cause, um, it's your birthday, so I figured it would be great to do something together.
just the two of us. - Yeah.
that's nice, but-- um, you know, I'm turning 16, not 60.
which still qualifies you as a minor. Wearing that doesn't qualify as a shirt, so...
put on a Jacket.
we're in the middle of a heat wave.
today's forecast calls for heat, frost, rain, hail, gale force winds, and severe lightning.
I'll have Fargo give her a checkup.
you know, I just-- I wanna do something normal.
like a party with my friends.
I think I liked it better when you were six.
Hey, Pilar.
what are you doing?
dad, what-- - hey, sheriff.
Bye, sheriff.
Oh, Pilar, just so you know, Zoe already has plans for her birthday.
bummer. - Yeah, bummer.
okay, enough mortification.
have a great day!
I'll remember this when you're getting arrested on dateline.
nice. No, we're planning-- a surprise party.
Hey, Kevin. What is, uh, november 3, 1957?
Tuesday.
Oh, pretty sure it was a thursday.
Nope. Tuesday.
whatever. Still gonna look it up.
have a good day, sweetie. Good luck.
he's in a great mood.
Yeah, he's been, uh, different recently.
like he's opening up.
that's great.
isn't it? - Yeah. Of course.
can we-- - Yeah. Yeah.
so are you gonna come to Zoe's surprise party?
Oh, me? I thought you were into young brunettes.
no, no. I'm into old bru
that didn't come out right, did it? - No. No.
well, we got a D. J.
and you really haven't lived until you've seen me dance to "hips don't lie."
well, you're on, old man.
you wanna get a cup of coffee?
I got a meeting.
but, um, you can ask me again.
whoa, you'd better-- - um, yeah.
morning!
okay, it's been six months.
since months since what?
six months since you said we would discuss my promotion in six months.
Jo, there's no official position between yours and mine.
great. I'll take yours.
Nah, today you're not gonna bother me.
today is a great day for Jack Carter.
Zoe has no idea about her surprise party, and I have a rain check for a coffee date.
you said you'd make a call to D. C. for special consideration.
but you're not very good at doing things that you don't really want to do.
tell you what.
because everything's going so well for me and because I'm such an amazing guy,
I will make the call right now.
Hello?
maybe it's a sign.
I think the Gods are angry with you.
and what makes you think that they're not angry at you?
Oh, because I'm an amazing guy.
what are you doing here?
well, that's a nice way to welcome your ex-wife.
could have given me a heads up.
it's her 16th birthday. You could have given me an invitation.
thank you, sheriff Lupo.
it's deputy. - Deputy.
until your husband chooses to promote me.
uh, ex. And I said I'd make the call.
Jack doesn't like doing things Jack doesn't wanna do.
tell me about it.
phones are back.
you look good, Jack.
does she know you're coming?
you look good, too, Abby.
come on.
you do.
it's just-- - you hate surprises.
Yeah, well, especially when I don't know they're coming.
Yeah, well, look, Jack, we had an agreement, and it's been a year.
I just assumed we'd talk about it again. - Okay, fine, let's talk.
deputy.
rub it in. There's been an accident at the spa.
Eureka has a spa? - Yeah. It's a fission-powered hot spring.
it's members only. There's been a...malfunction.
can you check it out?
Abby and I are gonna go...
for coffee.
Thanks.
nothing would make me happier. Sir.
Hey, sheriff. - Hey, guys.
morning, sheriff. - Morning.
did you see them? Just like...
clones.
very similar.
why is it only raining over there?
pacific northwest.
look, um, Zoe loves it here.
she couldn't be happier, and she's really thriving.
I think it's the best thing we could have done for her.
you sure that that's her perception and not yours?
don't do that. - What?
the shrink thing you do where you make, you know, you sound like you're the better parent.
it's called insecurity, and it stems from the person listening, not the person speaking.
and remind me again why I used to think it was fun to fight with you.
because you like a challenge.
with these unstable pressure systems,
I predict a whopper of a storm is coming our way.
I'm Pete Puhlman for storm watch.
so, I thought I'd stay a week, and we'd have a party and we'd still have a couple of days before Zoe and I
my special double yolk quail egg omelet with Estonian caviar and basil grafted from an Italian monastery.
Thanks, Vincent.
Oh, my god. Is that truffle oil?
Yes!
finally, a refined palate.
the last time I served it to him, he asked for ketchup.
on the house.
except for the muffin.
this day is shaping up.
look at those two.
Oh, now I just feel sick.
Hey, what a surprise. - Hate surprises.
meeting, huh? - Brunettes, huh?
I was just telling Jack what a striking couple you are.
well, thank you. - Oh, thank you.
and you are... - Oh, Jack's evil ex-wife, Dr. Abby Carter.
Dr. Allison blake.
Dr. Nathan stark.
all these doctors. Your worst nightmare, Jack.
he used to hate it when I dragged him around to my alumni functions.
he called it death by dull.
he is very clever.
so, uh, will you be staying at the house?
no. - Yes.
we're, uh, setting her up at Beverly'S.
well, um, then I guess I'll see you at Zoe's party.
I hear there'll be dancing.
Oh, Jack and I won a Macarena Contest in Cabo once. Remember that, Jack?
I can't wait for the party.
you may think you've put the past behind you, but...
these things take time.
the heart doesn't heal overnight.
nor should it.
that's why it's important to find constructive ways to work through the pain.
which is precisely why I want to continue Kim's research.
is that the only reason?
does it matter?
when you're asking to work at the most advanced research facility on the planet,
I'm afraid it does matter.
and does everybody at G. D.Fall under this level of scrutiny?
of course.
including Kim.
were you seeing Kim?
on and off.
more during the months leading up to her...
to the accident.
but you never talked about her research.
up to a point. My security level doesn't cover section five projects.
but she told me what she could.
so you never visited her lab.
no.
right.
sorry. - Go ahead. We're done.
same time tomorrow? - Absolutely.
yeah?
hot, yeah? - Yeah. So I've noticed.
it's crazy.
I come to turn on the nuclear bubbles, and look what I see.
What--what is this?
my first big case.
so is Zoe excited at all?
uh, yeah. Yeah, sure, I guess.
you guess.
Abby, we should talk. - Oh, god, Jack.
I never thought it was settled.
you didn't tell her. - I assumed we were gonna talk about it.
we had an agreement. - That was before.
before what?
before probably the greatest year of my life.
and when were you planning on sharing this with me?
I don't know.
the next time you called.
I didn't plan on you just showing up.
God, Jack, you know, you've had a year. This is just like you.
this is so unfair. It's-- it's snowing.
what is it with this place?
I-- Hold on.
Yeah, Jo, it's not a good time right now. It's, uh...
snowing.
what?
did-- did you call Henry?
okay. I'll be there as soon as I get Abby settled. Thanks.
Abby is not settling this time, Jack.
I didn't close the spa.
I've got sciatica, and no one's ever told me about this place?
it's on G. D.Property, Carter.
you guys don't belong here. Employees only.
we're here on official business.
the grotto closure. Yeah, inconvenient.
at least Alma's still giving shiatsu.
you have shiatsu?
Carter, over here.
is that embroidered?
membership has its privileges.
you mean those brainiacs use a nuclear reactor to heat their whirlpools?
not the reactor. Just the byproduct from the core cooling system.
this is a byproduct of a cooling system?
flash freezing? Not likely.
well, we'd better get an I. D.
okay...
which piece do we start with?
still think these nuclearhot tubs are safe?
Yeah, but you see what happens when they changethe natural order of things?
I mean, everything's under control, then somebody throws a wrench in something that's working perfectly fine for unselfish reasons.
then your life is shattered, and she's blaming you.
what?
are we still talkingabout the reactor?
Yeah.
what?
okay, so how are we gonnaget an I. D.Now?
just look fora finger.
how 'bout a...
a thumb?
you sure that's a thumb?
only if it has a print.
Baxter, neil. G.D. Employee. Number 185627.
it's a thumb.
I can't explain the death.
scientifically, the reactor just doesn't make sense.
I mean, if the hot spring shad boiled, I'd say, you know, maybe there was a leak.
well, Henry mentioned something aboutthe cooling system?
which doesn't go below 20 degrees. Skiing weather.
okay, so like the snowat Beverly'S.
I don't know, Carter. Why don't you look into it?
unless you're too busy with personal matters.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
did I miss something?
I-I just want to get this figured out as quickly as possible.
Oh, my god. You're jealous.
of?
what do you think?
Oh, please.
come on. You have nothing to worry about.
I'm not worried.
you know what, let's just stay focused on work so we can avoid these awkward moments.
these awkward moments are the only social lifeI have left.
check this out.
this was Baxterthe frozen guy's lab.
I've been filling in sometimes.
Baxter was conducting a real-time field study on the mating habitsof a tribe in Tanzania.
see those two?
it's Danny and Sandy. They've been together since they were teenagers.
how about the jumpy one?
he's been like that since he hooked up with Katie.
exactly how much time have you spent down here, Fargo?
Baxter put upa live webcast every day to poll viewer reaction to the relationship dynamics.
better than the bachelor.
was he working withanyone else?
I wouldn't call it working.
he was known to doa lot of field testing with the female lab techs, if you know what I mean.
gave new meaning to the term wild monkey
please stop that.
new priority email message from: "unknown" "sender for your eyes" "only access restricted enter password" "Dr. Nathan Stark" a total mystery to me.
I'm scared, Henry.
in three days, Zoe turns 16.
any man who say she understands women is either naiveor a liar.
well, apparently, Baxter did. He was the Casanova of section three.
I've questioned six women who thought he was god's gift to their gender, even when there wasn't enough of him to go around.
well, therecertainly is now.
what did Allison say?
she doesn't think it was the reactor.
she's right.
the cooling system could not possibly create a temperature that low to freeze tissue that fast unless we were into China syndrome times five.
well, I have Jo retracing his last day.
it's gonna take mea little time to get you an accurate time of death.
I have to wait for this tissue to thaw.
Yeah, or we could just read his watch.
got 12... - 26
you know, if we werethat smart about women, - Yeah.
Oh, no, what time-- Zoe.
OOP. - Yep. Got it.
so...
what's the one next to mercury?
gold.
every girl's favorite element.
that's my mom.
you didn't tell me.
I wanted to surprise you.
I hate surprises.
you're just like your dad.
we've got so much to talk about. Come on.
Hey, sweetie. I thought I'd swing by and pick you up
she promised-- No, it's terrific!
I mean, yeah, surprise! Just, um...
don't talk to her till I get there.
all right. Bye.
okay, I give up. So where do you live?
in there.
both of you? - It's underground.
well, that makes so much more sense.
Hi, Jack. - Hi, dad.
Hi.
what are you doing? I asked you to wait.
has she spoken to you? - What?
you told her.
no, Jack-- - This is so like you!
you're just tearing-- - whatever's good for you.
stop judging me
I'm gonna look like the bad guy just because you want to come here and take away my kid.
what are you talking about?
you didn't tell her. - No.
but you just did.
can someone just treat me like a person and tell me what's going on?
your mom and I had an agreement when you came to live here.
what kind of agreement?
I just wanted us to be a family.
just you and me, you know...
with no time limit.
but there was a time limit.
it was a year, and then you were supposedto come back to L. A.with me.
and you were supposed to tell her. - Don't blame this on me.
okay, that's enough. This isn't about either of you, okay?
you've already ruined your own lives. Just leave mine alone.
Zoe
what is happening?
get inside!
s. A. R. A. H. Door!
what the hell was that?
that would be a severe dust storm precipitated by unstable pressure systems.
what the hell was that?
that--that was, uh, the house.
Abby, house. House, Abby.
this is that Abby?
your house talks to you? - Yeah.
listen, Zoe-- - I'm going to my room.
sweetie, wait, wait. We have to talk about this.
just give her some space.
Oh, so now you're the expert. - Yeah. I am.
she's a different kid. And I'm a different parent than I was a year ago.
and I know I was awful, but you gotta cut me some slack while I figure out why we almost ended up in Kansas.
Look--hey, uh, S. A. R. A. H.
you said that we were infor some freaky weather today. How'd you know that?
I receive weather updates every quarter hour from the Eureka channel.
from the weather guy?
Mr. Puhlman prefers meteorologist.
he's a little sensitive about it. - Okay. I gotta talk to him.
no, no, you have to talk to me and our daughter.
I know, and I will--I just have to deal with this first.
and, no, I can't go into it.
sure. Go to work. Your favorite hiding place.
you're much shorter than I pictured you, Abby.
a volatile storm system is taking us to level yellow, so everyone is strongly encouraged to stay indoors.
the cumulator 2100 is predicting high winds, sporadic down pours, and more froston Socrates avenue.
so keep it tuned to storm watch, because we're in for one wild ride, folks.
I'm Pete Puhlman.
sorry about that.
emergency updates all day long. - Yeah.
how can I help you, sheriff? - I don't know.
I'm hoping you can tell me what the hell's going on with the weather.
Yeah, no problem. - Okay.
see...
cumulator 2100.
it's the most sophisticated meteorological predictor in the industrialized world.
if I had a nickel for every time I'd heard that...
continue.
it all began with a severe temperature drop last night over the hot springs which precipitated a chain reaction of unstable pressure systems.
the rain downtown, the snow on the north side, the dust storm, all
Yeah. All caused by the initial drop in pressure. Watch.
the pressure drop began here.
by the time it hit the hot springs, insta-freeze.
so the freaky weather didn't cause the freeze.
the freeze causedthe freaky weather.
exactly.
okay, so the question is what's there?
Hi, Allison. - Hi, Beverly.
this is, uh, crazy weather, huh? - I know.
I appreciate you coming.
I'm always happy to come to the office for a session.
actually, I didn'tcall you here for me. It's Henry.
I need him cleared to work at G. D.
well, our sessions are going well.
I think maybe in another few weeks
I'm afraid I can't wait that long.
Henry's in a fragile state of mind, Allison. He's not ready.
I'd like to help you out, but I have to put him first.
I'm afraid in good conscience I can't sign off on this.
all right.
then I'll do it myself.
it's me.
Henry Deacon is being cleared to return to global.
I know.
I'm coming in for a debriefing. We need to strategize.
Jo, I sent you a picture with a map... - got it.
I need you to check out what's there. - Did it.
I think it's a pretty good lead. - Good lead. I know.
so if you let medo my job for a change-- emphasis on change
Jo, I have enough women who are mad at me today.
I found a cabin.
what? Where?
right smack-dab in the middle. And it's owned by Dr. Steven Whiticus.
and you'll never guess who was the last personto call Baxter the night he died.
well, no. Um, his wife. Wendy.
Baxter was field testing the wife?
maybe the husband found out and, you know, crime of passion.
okay. I'll check outthe cabin. You check out the doctor.
she's gone, Jack. She ran away.
what?
it's just like before.
all right, did she take anything with her?
no, she just--she left the house by herself.
well, she does that all the time.
I mean, she's not gone, Abby. She's 16.
Yeah, but how do you know for sure? - Because I do. I know her.
she wouldn't run away. Not like that. Not anymore.
Oh, so I'm the only parent that she runs away from. Is that what you're saying?
I'm not saying that.
what I am saying is that things have changed.
you haven't changed, Jack.
you've always put your work before us.
that's why she started running away to begin with.
okay.
let's go.
what?
look, I have to work, so if you wanna talk, you have to come with me.
see? Change.
I'll call from Whiticus's cabin.
she's still not answering.
it's because she's still pissed.
and whose fault is that?
Oh, well, mine, obviously.
because everything badt hat happens would be my fault.
well, I wouldn't say everything bad.
she'll call when she's ready. - Yeah.
that's her. - Good.
Hey, sweetie, thanks for calling. We really app--yeah.
Yeah. Y-yeah, you're right.
I was wrong.
so
what did she say?
she's fine.
she never wants to talk to either one of us again. But she's fine.
she's spending the night at a friend of hers.
Pilar's. Nice girl, actually. Good influence.
I think you'd like her.
wait here. I'm gonna go take a look around.
welcome to Eureka.
so you were the last person to see neil Baxter alive last night.
relationships are so complicated.
I mean...
I love my husband.
he's a brilliant man.
it's just that, uh, neil gave me something I haven't had for so long.
Passioncan be so powerful.
okay, so you two were together for how long last night?
at the cabinuntil about midnight.
and then I drove home and neil went to the hot springs.
he always liked to soak after...
come take a look at this!
Mrs. Whiticus.
I'm going to have to ask your husband some questions.
darling, look.
a typhoon.
that was crazy, huh?
the--the storm. Yeah.
so you wanna talk about it?
it's been such a hard year, Jack, you know, all by myself.
and I've been thinking about so many things, you know?
like how we got to this place after 15 years.
I miss Zoe so much.
and I hate to admit it, but I missed you too.
are you even listening to what I'm saying?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just give me a sec.
unbelievable.
what the hell?
yeah...
does this look like a crazy weather machine to you?
Oh, like I would know?
good point. Hold on.
Hey, Jo, it's me。
I'm out at Whiticus's cabin. I think I found something.
Yeah. I've been trying to get a hold of you.
I found something in his basement.
he's created mini-climates using some kind of microwave technology.
any chance it looks like a...
big, scary satellite dish?
Yeah, based on the schematics.
Yeah. And, uh, if what I'm seeing down here is any indication of what you're gonna see out there, it's gonna bea bumpy night.
well, keep him there. I'm on my way over.
look, Abby, I'm-- - I know.
can we talk about it another time?
no need. Just, um...
just take me home.
I think I've seen enough.
think I'm gonna have to take you in for questioning.
what?
Dr. Whiticus, you're under arrest for the murderof neil Baxter.
I don't understand.
please, you're making a mistake.
he can't leave the house.
so you found out Baxter and your wife were having an affair, and you froze him with a giant microwave
okay, stop!
he couldn't have killed anyone.
he's practically blind.
his eyes are too sensitiveto leave the house, even at night.
we have special lights, filters on all the windows.
could have had an accomplice.
why would I want to kill the man who finally brought happiness to my wife?
Hey, look who made it for pizza.
there's not gonna be any pizza.
come on, sweetie.
can you wait for mommy in the car?
what's going on, Allie?
Nathan, I'm going to ask you a question, and I swear, if you lie to me...
I'm listening.
I know about kb-201.
I really wanted to tell you. - Tell me what?
that you only brought my son here to study him?
that you put his life at risk?
the only reason we studied him is to make sure his life isn't at risk.
what are you talking about?
Kevin has a connection to the artifact.
he draws pictures. He makes models.
he knows exact geometric details.
we've been trying to understand why.
he has been different ever since that accident in section five.
he was down there, and you didn't tell me!
Allie, I would never put him in harm's way.
you have to know that.
I don't know anything anymore, Nathan.
get in the car.
Where'd this come from?
make it stop!
it's okay, baby.
make it stop. Make it stop.
it's okay, baby. It's gonna pass.
make it stop!
please tell me what's happening.
I don't know yet.
you knew about the affair?
well, my eyes may not work very well, but...
doesn't mean I'm totally blind.
I always knew I wasn't enough for Wendy, even before the accident.
the glasses help you see.
infrared wi-fi signal lets them augment the little bit of retinal usage that I retain.
the...
array thing we found at the cabin.
could that have caused the frost?
well, I designed it to refreeze the melting polar ice caps, to bring rainto drought-plagued nations.
but there were calibration problems that I was working to fix.
that's what led to my accident.
I decided to stop the project because it was too dangerous, and I didn't want it to harm anyone else.
would Wendy?
what possible reason would she have to want to hurt anyone?
she was at the cabinthat night.
and she wasn't Baxter'sonly...
experiment.
you know, jealousy is a very powerful
you said the device went off at 12: 26. - Yeah.
but I called her the minute I heard the frost predicted on the news.
she was home by midnight.
the 11: 00 news with Pete what's-his-name?
the weatherman. - Meteorologist.
he's pretty touchyabout it. - Yeah.
well, Peter'salways been very touchy.
he was part of the dish installation team.
he's always cravedthe limelight.
still, if he hadn't havepredicted the ice storm, I guess
Yeah, then maybeit wouldn't have happened.
Jo, can you watch him?
Hey, allison. It's Carter. Meet me at the tv station.
Hey, Pete, it's getting pretty nasty out there.
you have any good news for us?
well, it's a category four ice storm, which will reach full strength in the next...
few hours.
it must bea weatherman's dream.
my job is to servethe community, which you should be evacuating, sheriff.
because this will bea direct hit.
it's amazing how accurately you've predicted each hit.
I know.
my cumulator technology is very precise.
Yeah!
when you predicted that ice storm at 11: 18, we were in the middle of a heat wave.
who would have thought an hour later you could be ice skatingon the hot springs?
apparently, not neil Baxter. - Yeah.
his death was tragic.
if he'd only seen my forecast, maybe it could have been prevented.
or maybe it could have been prevented if somebody hadn't turned on the, weather dish death machine while he was soaking in the grotto.
are you referring to Dr. Whiticus's climate dish array?
you think that's what caused all this? - Pretty sure.
I warned him.
I warned him that it was reckless to continue his research.
honestly, that thing should be destroyed.
that'd be a relief to you, huh?
Why--why would I
well, if Whiticus can control the weather, then there's not much need for a weatherman, is there?
I had nothing to do-- - you started the storm so you could be a hero, and Whiticus's research could be shut down once and for all.
you can't prove that. - Actually, I can.
we found footprints by the dish.
odd thing, though--there was no tread.
now, who would wear dress shoes to tramp around in the woods after midnight?
huh, Pete?
now, why don't you save us the trouble of matching our prints to your shoes and help us stop this thing.
now, I never
I never meant to--to hurt anyone.
I mean, I didn't even know that Wendy and Baxterwere out there.
I'm not a killer, sheriff.
I-I'm just
I'm so tired of no one taking me seriously as a scientist in this town.
I mean, it works. My technology is the vanguard.
well, it won't matter if the storm wipes out the town.
and we only have a few hours to save it.
level 5 warning
Yeah...make that one hour.
it's been building since last night.
it is an incredibly dangerous confluence of meteorological events.
a perfect storm.
thank you.
a spinning cyclone of instability high up intocryosphere.
ice funnel of death. - Gotcha.
why don't you people just say"ice funnel of death"?
how is this happening so far from the ocean?
like Archimedes.
because of all the volatility in the area, it's providing enough coldmoisture for the storm to brew, and it's happening fast.
this is tomorrow.
and there's no way to stop it?
well, warm tropical currents could counteract an event like this, but we're nowhere nearan El Nino.
I might have to evacuate the town.
no, there's no time. We might end up with a bunch more frozen Baxters.
look, all we need is warm water, right?
if your dish thing could freeze the hot springs, could it heat a lake?
theoretically, i-it could. But it doesn't have the range.
presumably, it's attached to a mainframe somewhere in the cabinet.
Yeah. It's attached underneath the house. It heats the house.
it's an environmentally conscious design.
well, that's it.
the lake is the water source for the hot springs, right?
linked to the reactor by an underground aquifer.
so you crank up the juice at G. D.
and we build some steam.
and I guess I get my raincoat.
Hey, how's it looking on your end?
we're at 850 degrees celsius. Are you there yet?
Yeah. But not for long.
inside the main control panel of the dish array is an override switch.
you need to manually aim the dish directly at the lake to get it to flash boil the water.
if it evaporates too slowly, we only strengthen the hurricane.
so no pressure.
timing is critical.
you need to activate the dish when we reach1, 000 degrees celsius to hit the flash boil point.
found the override. Where do I aim it?
you need to dial it 60 degrees to the northeast.
we're at 975 degrees.
got it!
No!
almost there. You ready?
hang on!
we're at 1, 000 degrees!
you have to do it now! - I'm trying!
how hard is itto push a button?
you wanna do it? - Carter!
he did it. Carter, are you okay?
Carter? Say something.
I want a raise.
like they think this is a solution, bouncing me back and forth.
well, who would you choose?
I mean, if you had to.
your mom or your dad?
well, if they loved me, they wouldn't make me. But...
right now I'm just so mad at my dad for lying to me.
well, you know, sometimes peoplehave good reasons for lying.
there is no good reason for lying.
surprise!
I hate surprises.
any job offers?
Yeah, a few.
I heard 17.
it would be crass to count.
just so you know, I traced the emailon kb-201.
I know you sent it.
I just wanted what was best for Kevin.
give me one second.
Henry, I've arranged for everything to be unsealed tomorrow
kim's section five records, all of her data.
Oh, thanks. It-- it means a lot to me.
me too.
thank you.
so has she said anything to you?
not a word. - Me neither.
but it really is a really nice party. - Yeah.
I'm glad she's having fun.
Mr. and Mrs. Macarena.
I really hate him.
so what do we do now?
what do you want to do?
I don't know.
well, then Zoe and I will go back to L. A. and...
and when you do, you'll know where to find us.
that's my mom.
I asked you to wait.
has she spoken to you?
what?
you told her.
no, Jack.
this is so like you!
I don't wanna look like the bad guy just because you wanna come here and take away my kid.
what are you talking about?
your mom and I had an agreement when you came to live here.
it was a year, and then you were supposed to come back to L. A. With me.
you've already ruined your own lives.
just leave mine alone.
were you seeing Kim?
more during the months leading up to her...
...to the accident.
so you never visited her lab?
no.
Hey. What's up?
noise complaint from the neighbors.
what neighbors?
the ones three miles down the road.
exactly what kind of noise are they complaining about three miles down
whoa.
never mind.
Yeah.
Oh.
Hello?
Ah, excuse me, sir?
yes?
Hi, I'm sheriff Jack Carter, and you are?
busy.
what is it that you need?
listen, Dr. Babajanian, we've had a noise complaint, and we're gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
but I'm working on simultaneously configuring the position and momentum of electrons so they'll no longer be conjugate variables, thereby debunking Heisenberg's uncertainty principal.
and as exciting as that may be, we're still gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
fine.
looks like you have an oil leak.
that's ununseptium, a highly volatile halogen.
whose effects on human skin have yet to be tested.
right.
so not an oil leak.
I told you to watch your head.
no, you didn't.
okay, you know you need special permission to use transuranic elements outside of global, right?
of course.
okay, so let me see your permit, doctor.
I'm sure they're on file, deputy.
while we go check that out, we're going to, uh, have to ask you to still keep it down.
thanks for your time.
Henry, are you sure about this?
I can set you up in a brand-new lab with twice the space.
kim's lab will do just fine.
then at least let me have someone clear out all the old stuff.
no, you said you were gonna leave it the same way it was the day that she...
well, at least until I had time to go through it.
I did and I have.
it's just...
this has to be hard for you.
I see it as a chance to stay close to her, continue her work.
you know, we used to finish each other's sentences.
so...
okay.
so Abby, you're heading back to Los Angeles?
Yep, this is it.
I'm sorry to see you go.
Oh, no, you're not.
sheriff Carter and Zoe will miss you.
no, they won't.
perhaps if you weren't taking Zoe away...
forgive me if I don't feel the need to justify my parental choices to a talking bunker.
fine.
don't let the door hit you on the way out.
you wanna piece of me?
are you, uh, threatening the house?
she started it.
Yeah.
are you okay?
Yeah, I got a headache.
Where's Zoe?
she's in her room.
she's okay.
she's using a virtual therapy device that Beverly gave her.
it's called an A. T.S.
I'll tell ya, the things this town comes up with...
Oh, yeah, it's a great place to live.
I mean, it's sort of full of mind-blowing opportunities and brilliant minds at the top of their game.
and the schools--amazing.
yeah?
are you really okay with this?
we had an agreement.
I know.
but I just don't want you to do that thing that you do, you know, when you say you're okay with something and then six months after that, we're at my parents'50th wedding anniversary and you've had one beer too many, and you ask my mom if the ball-buster gene comes from her side of the family?
you threw out my baseball cards.
we were having a baby.
we needed the room.
I had a 1989 upper deck Ken Griffey, Jr. Rookie card.
do you have any idea how much that's worth now?
no, and dear god, before you tell me, let's just try and swing this right around to my original point.
are you okay with me taking Zoe back to L. A?
Yeah. I'm okay.
okay.
cause the end of the semester's coming up, and I'm gonna be coming back to get her.
so...
I'll call ya.
how many times have I asked you not to leave your stuff lying around?
huh?
Hey!
I'm talking to you here.
Hey, I'm getting my head shrunk here.
Yeah, well, shrink it after you're done cleaning up your mess, okay?
is that the, um...
IRS thing from Beverly?
she's out of town and...
she thinks it'll help me confront my inner fears and resolve my anger issues.
how's it working?
well, I'm still pretty pissed, so...
do you wanna talk?
no, actually.
I want you to leave me alone.
hmm.
okay, that's...
the exact opposite of leaving me alone.
I know you're upset.
but your mom really misses you.
we agreed to shared custody.
and I think that, um, if you don't give this a shot, you will regret it.
custody.
meaning ownership.
meaning I have no say.
Zoe, your mom loves you a lot.
well, you know,
I gotta give her credit.
at least she's willing to fight for me.
I'm gonna go clean up my stuff.
whoa, whoa, whoa whoa!
what are you doing?
uh, rearranging furniture.
what are you doing here?
well, I said I was taking the afternoon off, not quitting.
okay.
okay, so everything back in its place.
go.
sure, why should I get to be by the window?
Hey, um, did you pull those, uh, permits I asked you to?
what?
the permits for, um, Babajanian's contraption?
what are you talking about?
I swear, sometimes...
I wonder if you even listen to me.
I feel like I'm talking to myself.
Hey, sheriff.
what can I get for ya?
uh, nothing right now.
have you seen Jo?
W-who?
my deputy.
Oh, you got a new deputy?
that's great.
I didn't get a new deputy.
I have a deputy.
deputy Jo Lupo.
Oh.
Yeah.
is he cute?
okay, now you're just bugging me.
I-I really need to talk to her.
uh, listen, maybe I could help.
has anybody here ever heard of a, uh, deputy Lupo?
sorry, sheriff.
I don't think anybody here has ever heard of her.
Oh, there you are.
here I am.
I thought you'd be at global today.
no.
Jack, you need something?
do you know a woman named Jo Lupo?
no, don't think so.
okay, this is really gonna sound strange.
I have a deputy named Jo Lupo.
small, but surprisingly strong.
bit of a gun nut?
no.
all right, I was having a conversation with her today, I turn my back for two seconds, and she's gone.
like vanished, and no one in the town even remembers her.
okay...
so, um, I think everyone is playing a trick on me, right?
so I go to her house, and, uh...
you know, the name on the mailbox is changed, and there's a family with, like, 12 kids living there, and the house is a different color, which is a bit far to go for a prank.
a bit, yeah.
you think I'm losing it, don't ya?
you think you're losing it?
I know this woman!
you know this woman!
all right, maybe something's affected your body chemistry or altered your neural pathway somehow.
were you exposed to anything?
Yeah, I visited a guy, he was, uh, playing with...
a new, uh...Atlantic element.
Transuranic?
Yes! Yeah, that's it.
would that do it?
no.
okay.
what else have we got?
well, um...
maybe, uh...
all right, maybe you fell into some freezing water, and, uh, you went into hypothermia.
no.
or you suffered a trauma, and that sent you into shock.
what
Yeah, I hit my head.
with what?
a heavy, metal object.
how many times?
repeatedly.
well, see?
that would have some effect.
so if that's our problem, get an MRI.
Henry, I've had a concussion before, that's not it.
do you remember Occam's razor?
um, yeah.
simple things, uh, are true.
close enough.
so you are either part of some...theoretical, unknown, scientific discovery where people vanish from our world and memories, or...
you suffered a head trauma.
well, when you say it like that...
get an MRI.
no.
what are you doing here?
that's my mom.
I asked you to wait.
has she spoken to you?
what?
you told her.
no, Jack.
this is so like you!

or you suffered a trauma, and that sent you into shock.
what
Yeah, I hit my head.
with what?
a heavy, metal object.
how many times?
repeatedly.
well, see?
that would have some effect.
so if that's our problem, get an MRI.
Henry, I've had a concussion before, that's not it.
do you remember Occam's razor?
um, yeah.
simple things, uh, are true.
close enough.
so you are either part of some...theoretical, unknown, scientific discovery where people vanish from our world and memories, or...
you suffered a head trauma.
well, when you say it like that...
get an MRI.
Yeah.
I'm not saying that you can't have one.
I'm just asking why do you want one?
it's not a big deal.
it's just, uh, I bumped my head this morning and Henry thought it'd be a good idea if I had it looked at.
you having any dizziness, nausea, headaches?
no, my head was pounding earlier, but it's, uh, fine now.
actually, it's totally fine now.
problem solved.
what's he even doing here?
he works here.
he was fired weeks ago.
okay, brain scan it is.
run an eeg and draw blood.
no, I just need an MRI, thanks.
relax, it usually only takes me two or three tries to hit a vein.
Oh, you're pretty talented.
Really?
No!
do you know anyone who'd be working on a...
really intense, unknown, theoretical scientific discovery?
you mean like a class eight project?
Yes.
let's talk about those.
sorry, all class eight research is classified.
Oh, you know what else should be classified?
a certain assistant's American idol audition.
what?
no, no!
Zoe promised me she was gonna delete that.
what's it gonna be?
fine.
give me an hour.
all right, so put the gown on, and all metal objects and jewelry in the tray.
all right.
are you okay?
uh, yeah.
just got a lot on my mind.
you know, you can always talk to Beverly.
first of all, no.
and, uh, second of all, she's out of town.
no, she's not.
I just saw her at cafe Diem.
well, then why's she having Zoe do therapy from home today?
I don't know, but...
is Zoe okay?
uh, actually, not so much.
no.
Abby's taking her back to L. A.
at the end of the semester as a part of our custody agreement.
and are you okay with that?
um...
Yeah.
it's complicated.
well, what do you think you should do about this?
I don't know.
what can I do?
I don't know, but if someone was gonna take Kevin away from me,
I would feel like my world was ending.
Yeah.
let's get this over with.
Hey, how's your head?
a waste of time.
the MRI was clear.
well, I wouldn't rule out your injury just yet.
it might not be me, though.
I mean, it might be a, uh, class eight project?
and what do you know about class eight projects?
mainly that I'm not supposed to know about them.
Yeah, that's true.
and I don't think that's your problem, because most of that research is theoretical.
I know, I know, and I know what I'm asking isn't probable, but is it possible?
Yeah, well...
it might have something to do with meta-material technology or vector decomposition or cellular irradiation.
okay.
but none of those things could remove someone from the world's consciousness.
Unless...it was some kind of transdimensional travel.
okay, let's go with that.
what's that?
movement between parallel universes.
right...
so you're saying that Jo got zapped to another universe?
or maybe you did.
theoretically, every universe is different.
but the closer they are, the more alike they are, with maybe just one difference.
a green sky instead of blue, cats chase dogs or
or in a town of 3, 000 people, one of them isn't where they're supposed to be.
exactly.
you know what, we should go talk to Nathan about this.
he's really good with this kind of thing.
great! Thanks.
you're welcome.
you know, I was really starting to worry if it was something to do with me.
well, that's where the smart money still is.
funny.
you wanna run that by me one more time?
people are disappearing into this crazy light, and nobody remembers them but me.
people like...
what difference does it make?
you're not gonna know who I'm talking about anyway.
I'm gonna double-check your MRI.
there's nothing wrong with my head.
well, what you're describing simply is impossible.
there's no technology that could create such an anomaly.
not even in Eureka.
well, how about, um, many-materials technology or, like, the cell phone radiation or decomposing vectors?
and now you're just putting words together.
okay, I don't know what I'm talking about, but Henry said that you would.
Henry Deacon. The...
how do you not remember--he was a friend of yours.
I have a lot of friends.
actually, not so much.
but we'll table that.
um, I think it has something to do with me, okay?
people I interact with, people I know, but whatever it is, we have to figure it out before it affects the other 3, 000 people in this town.
you see, now I know it's in your head, because Eureka's only half that size.
that means it's spreading.
Nathan, you gotta help me.
okay.
great. Where do we start?
you start by going home and getting some rest.
and I'll start by double-checking your MRI.
come on.
come on.
Hey, what's up?
Hey, um, uh, where are you?
home. Why?
all right, stay there.
okay?
what's happening?
I don't know, but if you see a big flash of light, I need you to run.
all right, just get away from it, and you call me, okay?
Seriously? Yeah.
seriously, um...
I'll be in touch. Gotta go.
did you get it?
Yes.
but you can't tell anyone I showed this to you.
if you don't show it to me, there might not be anyone left to tell.
I have no idea what that means.
Ah, you don't have to.
why do you need it anyway?
you wouldn't believe me if I told you.
huh, Stark's on this list.
of course he is.
he's done more class eight projects than anyone else at global.
and this guy, I know this guy.
saw him this morning. Uh, Dr. Babajanian?
Yeah, he's a quantum physicist.
any chance what he's doing could punch a hole in another dimension?
not likely, but when you start dealing with subatomic particles, the typical laws of nature no longer apply.
okay. Thanks.
and, um...
you got a great voice.
don't let anyone tell you different.
Hey!
Hey, Carter. What's going on?
I need you to come with me.
there's this noise complaint on the outskirts of town.
this guys is using an element he doesn't have permission to use.
so make him get a permit.
Yeah, well, I'm not supposed to know this, but he's one of your class eight scientists.
Carter, everyone knows who the class eight scientists are.
well, Fargo said he's working with atoms, and I just think this guy Babajanian could be a really serious threat.
who? Uh, Babajanian.
weird guy, lives on the outskirts of town.
Yeah, I know who Babajanian is.
who told you that he works with atoms?
Oh, man.
mm, hey, sheriff.
soup?
ya hired Larry the kiss-ass?
okay, Carter, I have work to do.
whatever this guy's doing, it's making people disappear, and I seem to be the only one who's noticing.
please.
please come with me.
okay.
Oh, hey, and watch your head.
he's got this big booming machine with lots of little things spinning...
you'll see.
Dr. Babajanian?
Dr. Babajanian?
this can't be happening.
can I help you?
Where'd you put it?
sorry?
Where'd you put it?
the machine with the lights and swirling?
could you be a little more vague?
the thing you built to find out where the electrons are and how fast they're moving.
I was right here this morning. I saw it.
what were you doing in my lab?
I know you're up to something.
I'm gonna figure out what it is.
miss Blake...
I'm sorry about the intrusion, Dr. Babajanian.
let's go.
Carter, there's nothing here. Let's go.
move!
not again.
I can't believe it got him, too.
what are you talking about?
you have no idea what just happened, do you?
I know you dragged me out to an empty lab.
and you're starting to scare me.
we gotta get out of here.
where do you think you're gonna go?
I'm not sure.
well, I'm glad you thought this through.
well, we'll get Kevin, we'll get Zoe, and we'll get the hell out of dodge while we still can.
avoiding the issue isn't going to help resolve it.
well, when the issue is that the people
I care about keep disappearing,
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
Carter, listen to me. I trusted you.
I need you to trust me.
let's just go back to the office,
I promise, we will figure this out.
you wanna help? Here.
one of the 20 people on that list knows exactly what's going on.
help me figure out which one.
Carter, there is nothing written on this piece of paper.
please.
I know that I can help you.
Carter, we need to slow down and talk about this.
I'm telling you, we gotta leave. It's spreading.
we can't stay.
Carter, just drink some water and calm down.
you're dehydrated.
I'm dehydrated? You gotta be kidding me.
just drink the water, all right?
I'm fine. Just drink it!
why the hell do I wanna drink
so I don't have to do this.
I'm sorry. It was for your own good.
how are you feeling?
like somebody stabbed me in the back.
and then stabbed me in the neck.
I'm sorry, there's nothing else I could do.
you were practically hysterical.
I expect it from Stark.
not so much you.
ex-husband Nathan Stark.
ego maniacal bane of my existence.
uh, well, that does sound like someone that I would marry
but, no, I've never heard of him.
the only way to fix the problem, is to recognize that you have one.
what is that? Aa?
Allison, don't I--I mean, apart from the...
remembering people that don't exist thing, don't I seem rational to you?
the former seems to negate the latter.
why are you talking like Beverly?
I'm just trying to help you.
okay, then think this through with me.
how many offices are thereat global?
over 1, 000.
how many people work there?
maybe 100.
doesn't that seem odd to you?
we're in a transitional period.
or your mind is reaching to justify what's happening.
I could say the same for you.
okay.
but you gotta let me go get Zoe.
I can't deal with losing her.
I won't.
okay.
thank you.
Allison, come here. Don't let it touch you.
Allison, move!
everything's gonna be all right.
Sarah, Door.
is everything okay?
not even close. Zoe!
thank god.
what's going on? Hey, sweetie.
um, get your shoes on, we gotta go, okay?
what's happening? - No questions, just go.
all right?
okay. Okay, great.
Sarah. Um, how many people live in Eureka right now?
my current calculations say two
you and Zoe.
okay, thank you.
Um...back to the beginning.
I'm coming.
what do you remember about this morning?
what do you mean?
um, okay, your mom was here, and, uh, you and I got in a fight, and you threw the thing at me and you left, right?
okay, mom has never been to Eureka,
I don't remember getting in a fight with you, and I don't know what thing you're talking about.
the thing.
the therapy thingy--the A. T.S.
what?
Oh, for the love of...
I was sitting here.
and I had it in my hands.
and I stood up.
dad.
I never put it down.
so?
so...
then I go back downstairs and I see you on the couch, right?
and I say that I'm going off to the office?
okay, that I remember.
but nothing before that?
well, nothing that you've mentioned.
so that's our first shared memory.
dad, I have no idea
what I'm talking about, I know.
that's the problem.
and the only way to solve a problem is to recognize that you have one.
okay, you sound like my therapist.
or a therapy device.
right, like the same one that you had, the one that I have no recollection of putting down.
I mean, I must've tried it on, right?
that's why everybody sounded like Beverly.
except you.
this is gonna be hard to swallow.
I don't think any of this is real.
okay.
I think that I'm...
we are in a program.
and, uh...
I don't know how to find my way out.
dad, you're freaking me out.
dad.
dad, can you hear me?
dad, can you hear me?
please wake up.
I'm so scared.
please.
Oh, sweetie. - Mom.
I drove back as fast as I could.
what happened?
I was doing my therapy on the A. T.S.
and dad walked in and we got in a fight and I threw it at him, and for some reason, he put it on, and when I walked back in, he was shaking and he wouldn't wake up.
and I shouldn't have thrown it at him.
honey, it's nobody's fault.
but can't you just take this off?
we're afraid that simply disconnecting him could send him into paralytic shock.
so what is happening to him?
actually, we're not sure.
the, um, A. T.S. was developed in collaboration with Beverly Barlowe.
but we've never had this happen before.
it's a virtual version of Eureka, down to the very last detail.
the user's subconscious issues come to life in the game.
normally, they're aware of what they're experiencing, and they can leave the program at any time.
we think the concussion may have caused a glitch in the mainframe, that Carter is unaware that he's in an altered reality.
is his life in danger?
someone answer me.
Yes. It is.
so let's get Beverly down here and fix it.
well, we can't reach her.
so we sent Henry to her house to find any information that can help us.
Beverly, this is Henry. I'm in your house now.
we really need your help.
so when you get this message, call!
dad, where are we going?
if this isn't real, there has to be a way out, right?
like an exit sign?
Yeah, I'm not that lucky.
um, you said this therapy thing is for confronting your fears, working out anger issues...
okay, I don't remember that.
Yeah, well, you said it.
and I'm not angry.
so maybe confronting fears is the way out.
yours or mine?
well, I'm wearing the thing, so I'm guessing mine.
okay, so what are you afraid of?
right now, that.
what is that?!
that's what's been taking people.
dad, what are you doing?
confronting my fear.
I am so sorry. Are you okay?
I'm...
Yeah.
I'm just, uh...looking for a cup of coffee.
allow me.
I, uh, cook when I'm upset.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
what are you all doing here?
we're here for Carter and Zoe.
all of you?
well, yeah, I mean...
he's our sheriff, and she's our girl.
Henry, did you find anything else?
just another A. T.S. Device.
now, I can take it apart, and we can see what the mechanics are.
Yeah, well, if he can hold on that long. - Yeah.
Hey, honey.
there's a whole lot of people out there who are worried about you.
you wanna come say hi?
not right now.
Zoe, you gonna eat?
he wouldn't leave me.
I'm not gonna leave him.
dad.
Zoe, come on.
what are you doing?
come on.
why aren't we running?
we don't have to.
you're gonna go. It's gonna take you.
I'm gonna stay with you.
Uhh!
dad!
w-what's happening?
we're losing him.
wait!
he's fighting.
dad!
Jack, you're all right!
I thought I'd lost you.
Oh, no, never. No.
no, no, no.
I knew you wouldn't leave.
I'm here.
looks good.
looks very good.
well, great.
Hey, uh...
Henry said you could have visitors?
uh, yeah, yeah, that'd be great.
okay, guys, come on in!
you look great.
Zoe, hi.
Hi. - Abby!
Hey, good to see ya.
good to see ya.
Ahh!
Hey, Chris. Thanks very much.
I really appreciate it.
thanks for that.
Hey, thank you so much.
how many of you are there?
Hi.
Hey.
Hey, how you feeling?
um...A little strange.
you know, I have all these, uh, memories and feelings about things that never happened.
well, that's gotta be pretty surreal.
you have no idea.
anyway, I just stopped by to see if you were okay.
to see if I'm okay?
Yeah, this is your first day back in Kim's lab.
I know that's a big deal.
Jack, it's fine. Really.
I mean, you're the one we should be worrying about.
they told me, uh...
the therapy thing was forcing me to deal with my feelings about losing Zoe.
apparently I have, um, abandonment, entitlement, and intimacy issues.
ha, congratulations. - Thank you.
even though that wasn't actually you, you helped me a lot in there.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
me too.
I should get going.
Abby's taking off, and I gotta talk to her before she goes, so...
all right, well, good luck and, um, thanks.
Yeah.
you wanted me to stop by.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I think we should talk.
Yeah, I know.
I'm happy here.
I know I complain about it, and...
it definitely has its quirks.
Yeah, that's one way of putting it.
Yeah.
but, uh...
I belong here.
and I'm doing some good.
you do. And you are.
and I think this place has been good for Zoe.
you know, I think she fits in here somehow.
well, maybe that's 'cause she doesn't fit in anywhere else.
she has some good friends.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
and I would never ask you to, uh, you know, not take her.
that wouldn't be fair to you or Zoe.
Jack, listen, I
that being said...
I can't go months without seeing my kid.
can't even go days, really.
so I'm...
...gonna ask for my job back in L. A.
Really?
Yep.
it's funny, you remind me of a man I once married.
so what do you think?
I think this place needs you.
and it wasn't until today that I realized just how much Zoe needs you.
and I can't take you away from here.
I can't take her away from you.
but-- - This is where she needs to be.
thank you.
I love you, Jack Carter.
Sarah. Door.
good evening, sheriff Carter.
will the former Mrs. Carter be joining you for dinner?
Oh, relax, Sarah.She's gone.
what a shame.
sarcasm doesn't become you.
Zoe, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to have all this cleaned up before you got home.
Oh, it's okay.
it doesn't matter. Leave it.
your mom and I had a talk.
I told her how much you love it here, and, uh...
...that you--you wanna stay.
and I told her that I would respect our agreement.
Oh.
um, what did she say?
Oh, she seems to think that, um,
I need adult supervision.
so...
if you're up for the task...
um, I think I can handle it.
I never wanted you to leave.
I never wanted to go.
dad, um...
thank you for fighting for me.
Yeah.
Sarah.What are you doing?
that was such a beautiful moment,
I thought musical accompaniment seemed appropriate.
uh, yeah, on second thought, L.A.'s not looking so bad.
well, you're stuck with us now, so, um, what do you say--burgers, cafe Diem?
sounds good.
Oh, Sarah.Knock it off.
you may get to him but you won't get to me.
there's only one thing I want from you, Jojo.
what is that?
it's a modified version of the memory neutralizer that I designed years ago.
can I borrow this? - Sure.
we've been searching for a...
unifying theory of everything.
you're talking about the Akashic field.
just wish I could see what was going on inside of his head.
why this is happening to him.
his brain is wired like no one else's.
he's created a connection to the field.
Albert Einstein said science without religion is lame, and religion without science is blind.
but is there still a place for faith in a world of science?
has our ability to unravel the mysteries of rainbows made them any less miraculous?
science may be the method by which we give name to god's miracles.
but faith is the question that arises every time an old mystery is solved.
the elegant explanations discovered every day in Eureka are the very reason to believe in something greater.
something beyond mathematics.
something divine.
dad!
Hey! What are you doing here?
I was just cleaning out my closet for donations, as requested.
and... I brought you breakfast.
thank you. Now...
what is it?
scrambled egg whites with spinach and tofu.
s. A.R. A.H. said your cholesterol's been running high from too much pizza.
Ahh. That's crazy talk.
Oh, almost forgot. I got you your Sunday paper.
here you go.
what do you want? - Who said I want anything?
it's Sunday morning. You're up before noon.
you're doing chores. You're bringing me the morning paper.
what do you want?
okay.
I wanna get a tattoo.
No!
okay, I'm being serious.
Oh, okay. No.
can we talk about this?
sure, yeah. We can talk about it.
and the answer is... no.
are you amused with yourself?
I'm pretty amusing.
gotta drop this off.
Oh! I am so telling S. A.R. A.H.
first Church of Eureka Sunday Meeting 10 am. All welcome!
thought-provoking sermon, reverend.
I mean, the most beautiful emotion we can experience is the mysterious.
I couldn't agree more.
unfortunately, I'm literally preaching to the choir.
well, you knew you were gonna have a small crowd when you took the job.
and it's not the size of the congregation that counts.
it's... the commitment.
still, a little more size could be nice.
mom?
and a little more time. Excuse me, reverend and Henry.
Diane, another lovely musical arrangement.
thank you very much, reverend.
how are you?
hanging in there.
you know, working helps. - Tell me about it.
anytime you need to talk, drop by.
I will. Thanks.
Bye, Henry. - Bye-bye.
how many people could understand the pain of losing a spouse?
well, we all deal in our own way.
still, I'm glad you've been there for her.
Yeah, me too. Thanks.
see you next Sunday? - Absolutely.
okay.
sheriff Carter.
Hi.
Yeah, um...
it--it's Jo's day off, and I drew the short straw.
so, uh, what have we got there?
donations. Uh, spring cleaning.
we'll make sure we get these to those in need.
a lot of need.
Hey, oh...
it's not even mine.
I blame you for her death.
I can't look at you without thinking that you're the one who did this.
that you're the one who took her away from me.
you okay, sheriff?
Yeah, I just...
remembered who I borrowed this from.
well, if you ever want to borrow my book...
Yeah.
see you next sunday, maybe?
I'll work on it.
I'll put these up front... for you.
I kind of wish I hadn't even told him.
I don't understand the appeal of painting oneself permanently.
maybe because, in your case, it would be considered graffiti.
I thought every kid from L. A. had a tattoo.
Oh, yeah, and preschoolers have body piercings.
haven't you guys ever been to, like, a big city?
Nope.
Oh! We did have that one wild weekend in Vegas.
we did.
Really?
okay, so it was a virtual Vegas, but it was like we were really there.
you guys really need to get out more.
I'll tell you what. This weekend, we'll take my car and...
well, what? Don't leave us in suspense. Spit it out.
Zoe, what's wrong?
I can't talk.
should I alert sheriff Carter?
Zo...Zoe. I can't talk.
can you talk?
Zoe? Pilar? What's happening?
what's happening to me?
what exactlyare you doing?
it's a portable M.R.I.
allows me to seeinside her throat.
you're making her nervous. - Just tell me what's wrong with her.
I don't know, it's not
well, they're all sufferingfrom sort sort of vocal cord paralysis.
from what? - I'm not sure yet.
okay, I'll...
hang out while you tinker with her voice box.
I don't tinker.
Carter, just... give him some time.
Yeah.
I'm scared.
I know. I know.
me too. Everything's gonna be all right.
he's pretty good at what he does.
we're gonna keep Zoe and the other girls here for observation at G. D.
until we have an answer.
okay. I'm gonna check out the house.
just... see if I canfind anything.
I already sent a science team. They can handle it.
Yeah, I'd preferto do my own digging.
it's, uh...
I'll see you soon. Okay?
what is that?
what...
What?! You--ohh!
God! So you weren't asking for permissionto get a tattoo.
you were just coveringyour ass, right?
is...
okay. Um...
you know, I'm just gonna do everything I can to get you healthy.
and then we're gonnatalk about that. Okay?
so, uh, Sunday specialis fallout flapjacks.
that's pumpkin pancakes with a radioactive swirl of cream cheese and nutmeg.
that sounds great, Vince, but I'm waiting for somebody.
Really?
who's the lucky lady?
No! - Yes.
I'm impressed.
Yeah, so am I.
and just a teeny bit scared.
Yeah.
well, same reasonan anti-establishment anarchist agrees to a cushy consulting jobat global dynamics.
the money--'cause you wouldn't believe what they're paying me.
well, the opportunity.
you know, this isn't just anywhere, it's Eureka.
True--if I'd come here sooner, things may have turned out differently for me.
like you wouldn't havegone to M. I.T. when you were 15?
actually, M. I.T. was great.
I could spend weeks at a time focused on a single variablein a lattice gauge equation.
it was heaven.
I had the same feeling assembling a chromium flashsuppression barrel for my grenade launcher.
Yeah, but that's simple mechanics.
particle and theoretical physics, that's the real mind candy.
well, some of us like practical application.
Oh, yeah, no. That's all good.
but, I mean, let's be honest.
that particle accelerator, it only gets built after someone comes up with the idea.
right?
so how about a vinspresso to top things off?
that's an excellent idea.
no, thanks.
I should be getting back to the office.
I thought you had Sundays off.
Yeah, I just remembered, I have some paperworkI forgot to finish.
thanks for brunch.
Hello?
still can't find the cause, but the good news is, it's not getting any worse.
well, I guess that's something.
are you doing okay?
Yeah, just...
seeing Carter so worried about Zoe just got to me.
I know how he feels. - Well, try and relax.
you been under a lot of stress lately.
I'll keep at it till I figure something out.
I know you will.
good night. - Good night.
what in the world?
hey there. Welcome back.
what's happening to me?
well, apparently your inner glow is becoming your outer glow.
please don't joke.
what were you doing before this happened?
uh, I helped Kevin with his homework.
then I took a shower and...
so kevin was home.
Yeah. Why?
I wonder if he was responsible.
why would he-- - I don't know.
but we've seen what kind of power he has.
if I'm right, and he's tapping into the Akashic field, then he's tapping into a very powerful energy collective.
holy crap!
what did you do?
I took a shower.
you look radiant.
we tested the water. There's nothing in it that could cause bioluminescence.
how does it happen?
enzymes in the skin pigmentbecome oxidized, and then they emit light.
Yeah, but that's with insects and marine life.
not anymore.
maybe it's some kind of bacterial reaction.
okay, you know what? Glowing or not, I'm still the head of G. D.
and unless this is contagious-- - no, no, no!
Ohh! I got cha.
the human body is not built for this.
whatever is causing your bioluminescence is also attacking your nervous system.
Allison, does G. D. have any projects in bioluminescencein development?
not at G. D. But maybe off-site.
and you're not gonna like who the project manager is.
why do you automatically assume I'm responsible?
are you really surprised?
I work in bioluminescence now, sheriff.
ever since you torched my necrosomnium violacea,
I needed a change of scenery.
I'm a busy man.
do you mindgetting to the point?
the point is that Allison Blake is shining like the northern lights.
fascinating. - Seth, what's the new project?
botanical marine cross-hibernization to create bioluminescent specimens.
I mate plants and fish to make them glow.
why would you do that?
that's classified.
the head of global dynamicsis a human glow stick, so unclassify it.
I've only just isolated the mitochondrial strains responsible for bioluminescence.
phase one includes simple organisms.
let me guess--phase two is human trials.
well, yeah. But I'm years away from that.
uh, still gonnaneed a sample.
waste of time. - Ah, we'll see.
until then, don't leave the aquarium.
at least you can't light it on fire!
Hey.
sorry I couldn't be here sooner.
you okay?
we're still going over the smart house, and Fargo is runninga full diagnostic on S. A.R. A.H.
okay, so don't worry--we'll find something soon.
how'd it go with Zane?
we can--we can talk about that later.
or now.
or now.
bottom line:
He's...brilliant.
I'm not.
it's the story of my life trying to get a date in this town.
he likes you.
but how long before he realizes I can't keep up with him?
anyway, I'm more concerned about you.
I'll live. I'm worried about Allison.
Yeah, I know.
me too.
what the...
why is it every time you show up, my work gets ruined?
I'm not the one who turned your aquarium into a theme park for the shining.
I didn't do this.
this just... happened.
this doesn't just happen.
water doesn't turn into...
blood?
that's what you're thinking, right?
Yeah. Great.
then you can deal with this.
I don't do blood. I'm a plant guy.
what's that?
it's a filtration system. Or it was.
there was a hole like that in the skylight at the smart house.
what does that have to do with this?
exactly.
Hey, who's gonna fix my tank?
no one. This just became a crime scene.
well, we didn't notice any before.
Yeah, well, we weren't really looking.
bingo.
so everything that's happened is--is related?
Yeah. But I'm not sure to what.
What'd you find out?
that the smart house had a circle of melted glass, as did Allison's house, and Seth's aquarium.
what happened at the aquarium?
the water in the marine tanks turned to blood.
or a blood-like substance.
you test the water?
Yeah, it didn't match when we compared it to her chem panel.
how bad is she?
whatever's triggering Allison's bioluminescence is working as a neurotoxin.
it's shutting down her bodily systems.
now, the reasonI brought her here is
I've been working on a nerve agent antidote for the military.
can you give it to her?
he can't. It doesn't exist yet.
but you're close.
how much time does she have?
now, Carter-- - how long?
12 hours.
maybe less.
hey... you okay?
what's happening?
well, we--we've gota few more incidents, so...
a few?!
Yeah.
Yeah, we're gonna figure this out.
you're gonna be fine. Okay?
but... um...
about your tattoo.
I overreacted.
I didn't hear you out.
and, uh, that's just...
I'm sorry.
I mean, I-I do think what you did was wrong.
but...
it's a tattoo.
that's just...
not important anymore.
I...think you should just focus on getting better. Okay?
am I going to die?
No!
I was trying to--I just
no, you're not gonna die.
we got it all under control.
just hang on one second. Okay?
I hope you have some good news.
Yeah, well, you were right.
all the glass melted the same way-- from the inside out.
and all the locations affected were using crystalline glass.
guess that's why every window in Eureka didn't go all salvador Dali.
exactly, so I'm gonna run this data with Nathan.
maybe this is the break we've been looking for.
great. Hey, um...
Thanks.
keep the faith.
believe me, I'm trying.
well, uh, Henry just figured something out that might help us, so...
you just hang in there.
okay?
Hey, Larry.
what, studying to be Pope?
no.
but with what's happening around town,
I thought I should cover my bases religion-wise.
what's religion have to do with anything?
well, call it what you like.
but girls losing their voices
that's like the tower of babel.
God smote those workers so they couldn't communicate.
and Dr. Blake...
glowing, like saints rising to heaven.
that's what the bible calls trans--transfiguration.
what if G. D. was built over a hell mouth?
a hell mouth?
say what you want, but when water turns to blood,
I say it's time to pray.
you might wanna run that one by the reverend.
I'm sure she'll geta laugh out of it.
well, considering she's the one I borrowed these books from,
I think I'll stick to my game plan.
harper gave you these?
she's giving them to everyone.
things are
in case you haven't noticed, god's come to Eureka.
Thanks. - For what?
you may have pointed me down the path of righteousness.
hallelujah, my brother!
shut up, Larry.
excuse me.
uh, do you know where I can find the reverend?
she just stepped out, but she'll be back for evening service.
and...
all these people?
they just come here to pray on their own.
sure.
people seek comfort in time of crisis.
and reverend Harper's door is always open.
how long have you known the reverend?
I have been the church's musical director since day one.
so... a while.
don't take this the wrong way, but I hear the Sunday sermons aren't quite...selling out.
please. - Sure, sure.
Eureka's built on science.
so it's hard for people here to just open up to something as uncertain as faith.
Reverend Harper was a theoretical physicist, so she has a way of bridging that divide.
and, as a church going scientist, I appreciate that.
do you believe in miracles?
I have to.
and, uh, what if they're just being used to get people in the pews?
the reverend's only concern is helping others.
sure about that? - She helped me.
when my husband Daniel passed away, I wanted to...
join him.
and the reverend showed me that where there is faith, there's hope.
she saved my life.
okay.
it must be pretty bad.
I am running through every variation of the neurotoxin antiserum.
I will find the solution.
except I probably won't be around for it.
let's discuss worst-case scenarios.
not yet. - I have to.
for Kevin's sake.
Nathan, if something happens to me,
I need you to take care of him.
you know I would.
and I want you to tell the D. O.D. what's happening.
no. No, not yet.
one more hour, I'll know if this last trial worked.
what if I don't make it through this?
you will.
you have to.
I love you.
I won't let you die.
I won't allow it.
we're getting reports from all over town, ma'am.
I promise. Sheriff Carter will get to you as soon as he can.
you should really wear your hair down more often.
really not a good time.
Yeah. No, I got that impression when you took off.
Look...forget it. It's nothing.
I think it is.
so either tell me why you're pissed at me, or I'll hold my breath until you do.
what are you, three?
Hey, I black out, it's on you.
okay... you didn't do anything.
it's me.
it's this whole town.
is this about the whole miracles thing?
cause, seriously, there's no such thing.
right, because only dumb people believe in something beyond tachyons and particle accelerators.
uh, maybe you should think this through before you start making accusations.
accusations against who?
I tried to call you, but my radio's out.
I think that reverend Harper might be responsible for what's happening.
you're both going to hell.
Now--look, look, look.
we got an empty church and a series of alleged miracles.
so I don't think it's crazy to ask who stands to benefit.
God.
Carter, you're way off base this time.
I hope so.
but before reverend Harper took up theology, she used to be a physicist.
you still think I'm going to hell?
probably.
I think you're jumping to conclusions.
okay, bottom line:
if reverend Harper is responsible, we're in for a lot more.
Yeah, like, a plague of locusts, or fiery hail, or total darkness.
you had to say it.
welcome to the end of the world, sheriff.
not if I can help it.
Thanks, uh...
uh... hi, reverend.
sheriff... welcome.
um, we need to talk to you for a sec.
actually, he wants to talk to you.
thanks for the support. - You're welcome.
what is it? - Well, um...
obviously, a lot of strange things have been happening.
one might say...
religious things.
some might--not me. - Or me.
I'm trying to work here, guys.
what's your point, sheriff?
I was wondering-- and forgive this
who would standto gain the most by, uh...uh, the sudden appearanceof apocalyptic-type signs?
all of us, I would think.
or maybe someone who's been preaching to an empty church every Sunday.
you do have a point.
Really? - Sure.
but whatever's happening, divine or not,
I had nothing to do with it.
and as much as I would love to believe that, you had the motive and the knowledge to pull it off.
we know about your background in physics.
theoretical physics, yes.
but there's a reason why I left research for the clergy, sheriff.
I, uh, wasn't muchof a scientist.
but I am a very good preacher.
well, we're still gonna have to ask you in for questioning.
no, wait, wait.
okay... okay. Um...
just relax.
well, um...
what is that?
how do you have music during a blackout?
it's a crystal radio system, powered by piezoel ectricity.
Henry, could radios be responsible for what's been happening?
um, radio waves, at the exact right frequency--yes.
they might have caused the interference.
can we test for that?
uh, reverend, we're gonna have to borrow that receiver.
well, if this is happening all over town, how come we haven't heard it sooner?
well, let's see.
sound waves can carry infrasonic frequencies that occur outside the rangeof human hearing.
and this crystalline glassis the same as we found in all three places.
and, uh, Seth's aquariumis made of the same stuff?
Yes--microorganisms in the water were sonically agitated, creating a red tide effect.
okay, but what about Zoe?
human tissues have the capacity to transduce pressure from sound waves.
infrasonic frequencies may be putting pressure on her vocal cords.
so Allison is-- - sonoluminescence.
um, sound waves reacting with water causing objects to glow.
so who could pull this off?
anyone with a background in acoustics and infrasonic research.
I'm gonna make a list.
Diane Lancaster is the head of acoustic engineering here at G. D.
I just spoke to her.
she's, um, the music director at the church.
here's the latest test results on Allison Blake, doctor.
I'm sorry, Dr. Stark.
all right, what do I do?
what do I do? What do I do? What do I do?
you've done all you can, Doctor Stark.
no.
this must be the place.
her husband died a few months ago.
she's, uh, been working at homeever since.
working on what?
and that would be?
a temporal rift.
or a portal to heaven.
No! Don't you come any closer!
okay... okay.
she wants to cross over.
into what? - Eternity.
what you're thinking about seems pretty permanent.
you wanna talk about it for a second?
there's nothing to talk about.
you don't understand.
I have found where everything meets.
the place where different points in dimensional space-time converge.
where Daniel is waiting for me.
okay, let's...
stick a pin in that.
that can't be heaven? - Why not?
I mean, if she's really discovered a--a gateway to the multiverse.
not helping. - I have faith that it is.
revelations, chapter four, verse one:
after this, I looked, and behold:
a door was opened in heaven.
you understand, don't you, Henry?
mom?
mom's sick, Kev.
and I can't help her.
but you're different, Kevin.
maybe you can.
do you realize what you're about to do?
I'm going to see my husband again.
he's gone, Diane.
and we need you here.
there's a lot of people suffering out there because of your machine.
and your knowledge might be able to save them.
you gonna... walk away from that?
you just gonna let 'em die?
No!
is that what Daniel would want?
I didn't mean to cause all these problems.
I just... wanna be with him again.
and you will.
you just have to havea little faith.
Jack, what if...
what if this really is what she thinks it is?
I mean, Kim could be...
Henry... you gotta turn it off.
I'm turning it off.
dad?
Oh, thank god.
are you really gonna make me beg?
you're here. - Yeah, well...
I had to see if you were lying about all the babes who go to church.
and you definitely were not.
so... how are you?
I'm miserable.
but I'm here.
well... have faith.
we'll see them again.
I promise.
I know we will, Henry.
it means a lot to me that you came, Nathan.
uh, anything for you.
you saved my life.
it wasn't me.
and it wasn't shutting down Diane's machine, either.
what do you mean?
he controls the field now, Ali.
he's evolving.
for the record, I'm really glad that I was wrong.
so we'll see you next Sunday, then?
it's a tough one.
the Dodgers are playing the Mets. So...
have a slice of pepperoni for me.
that I can do.
Thanks.
see ya.
uh... hang on for a second.
um, I borrowed this book from you.
I just wanted to return it.
I don't remember that.
well, I hope you enjoyed it.
Yeah.
I mean, it really opened my eyes.
as all good books should do.
Yeah, Henry... - yeah?
you're my best friend, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
is it a sin that my favorite part was the music?
well...
you stayed awake, right?
you hear the guy snoring behind us?
like a chainsaw. - Yeah.
so, dad, um...
you know my rose tattoo?
it's fake.
it's fake? - Yes.
but since you seemed okay with it,
I can get a real one now, right?
Yeah. - Really?
Absolutely. - Really?
when hell freezes over. Yeah.
the ARTIFACT IS CAPABLE OF HUMAN INTERFACE,
and YOU KNOW WHO IT IS. KEVIN.
he CONTROLS THE FIELD NOW, ALLIE--HE'S EVOLVING.
if THEY GET A HOLD OF KEVIN,
he WILL NEVER HAVE A NORMAL LIFE
well, WE HAVE GET THAT THING OUT OF HIM.
any STRUCTURES MADE OF METAL
definitely A MUTATION ON THE ORIGINAL STRAIN.
it's LIKE SOMEONE FLIPPED A SWITCH
and TURNED IT INTO A VORACIOUS METAL-EATING BUG.
this MAN ONLY DIED A WEEK AGO.
what IF THE METAL-EATING BACTERIA MUTATED AGAIN
before WE CAUGHT IT ALL?
it STARTED JUMPING TO PEOPLE?
[alarm] IT'S A RED LEVEL SECURITY BREACH.
the BACTERIA... IT'S AIRBORNE.
ohmy GOD.
is THAT BEVERLY?
biohazard DETECTED, SECTION FOUR.
all PERSONNEL MOVE TO EMERGENCY EXITS.
what THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?
code RED BIOHAZARD
activates THE PANIC ROOM PROTOCOL.
the DIRECTOR'S OFFICE BECOMES A BUNKER
in CASE OF BIOLOGICAL ATTACK.
what ABOUT AN AIRBORNE BACTERIA?
what THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
Henry SAID THAT THE BACTERIA
mutated AND CONSUMED A CORPSE IN THE MORGUE.
we WAS AFRAID THAT IT HAD BECOME AIRBORNE.
looks LIKE HE WAS RIGHT.
Dr. STARK, WE'VE HAD TO QUARANTINE SECTION FOUR
and THE PEOPLE IN IT.
we NEED EVERYONE ELSE INTO DECONTAMINATION.
no, WE HAVE THREE ADULTS AND A CHILD
Carter, HE'S RIGHT.
we CAN'T HELP IF YOU AND I ARE ON THE MENU.
now THEY'RE IN THE SAFEST PLACE IN THIS BUILDING.
they ARE SEALED A MILE UNDERNEATH.
if WE'RE GONNA HELP,
we NEED EQUIPMENT AND A PLAN.
and WE'RE REALLY NOT GIVING YOU A CHOICE, SIR.
mom?
it's OKAY, BABY.
something SET OFF THE PANIC ROOM.
well, I DON'T CARE WHAT SET IT OFF.
we ARE GETTING OUT OF HERE.
I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU GOT OUT,
and WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE DOING HERE.
why DON'T YOU ASK, HENRY.
we're HERE FOR KEVIN.
we'll LINK INTO COMMUNICATIONS FROM MY OFFSITE LAB.
once THE PANIC ROOM IS SECURE, A DIRECT LINE TO THE D. O.D. IS ACTIVATED.
Allison SHOULD'VE BEEN IN CONTACT BY NOW.
I'm ON IT.
this PLACE WOULD COLLAPSE WITHOUT ME.
it ALREADY HAS.
connecting GENERAL MANSFIELD NOW.
Ah, DR. STARK.
general MANSFIELD, HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO DR. BLAKE?
we've BEEN UNABLE TO MAKE CONTACT.
panic ROOM SHOULD'VE HOOKED UP AUTOMATICALLY.
well, THEN I GUESS WE CAN ASSUME THAT THE SYSTEM'S FAILED.
now WE ARE GOING TO NEED AN ACTING DIRECTOR
until WE CAN ESTABLISH CONTACT.
in LIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE
that YOU PRESENTED BEFORE THE REVIEW COMMITTEE,
I'm APPOINTING YOU.
REVIEW--WHAT EVIDENCE? WHAT?!
that DR. STARK WAS IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE
for THE ACCIDENT THAT KILLED KIM ANDERSON.
who WAS?
she's IN THAT PANIC ROOM. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
I THOUGHT YOU HAD HER UNDER CONTROL, DR. STARK.
I'm WORKING ON IT, GENERAL.
we KIND OF HAVE BIGGER ISSUES AT THE MOMENT THOUGH,
don't YOU THINK?
Yes, WE DO.
the DETECTION SYSTEM IS SHOWING US THAT THE OUTBREAK IS SPREADING BEYOND SECTION FOUR.
the RELEASE OF AN AIRBORNE PATHOGEN LIKE THAT WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC.
now IF WE CANNOT KEEP IT CONTAINED,
I WILL ORDER A THERMAL CLEANING OF THAT ENTIRE FACILITY.
general, A THERMAL CLEANING WILL WIPE OUT ALL ORGANIC MATERIAL IN GLOBAL DYNAMICS.
it WILL SET OUR RESEARCH BACK DECADES.
not TO MENTION KILL EVERYONE IN SECTION FOUR,
well, THEN I GUESS WE BETTER GET IT CONTAINED.
you HAD PROOF THAT BEVERLY KILLED KIM,
and YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?
I COULDN'T. YOU COULDN'T.
it's COMPLICATED, CARTER.
you KNEW SHE WAS A SUBJECT IN AN OPEN INVESTIGATION,
and YOU BROUGHT HER HERE BEHIND MY BACK.
and NOW SHE'S LOCKED IN A ROOM WITH ALLISON,
Kevin, AND HENRY.
NOW...DOES HE KNOW THAT BEVERLY KILLED KIM?
who DO YOU THINK GAVE ME THE EVIDENCE?
call TAGGART.
get HIM TO MEET US AT GLOBAL.
bring THE BIO SUITS. OKAY, WHY?
cause WE'RE GOING BACK IN.
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
I LET YOU TALK ME INTO CHAPERONING.
Hey, NO ONE SNAPPED OFF YOUR FINGERS.
the EASE WITH WHICH YOU SAY THAT
is ALMOST AS DISTURBING AS IT IS HOT.
I KNOW.
Hey, CHIA PET, WANNA DANCE?
well, WHEN YOU ASK LIKE THAT
a BIOHAZARD'S BEEN DETECTED AT G. D.
all RESIDENTS MUST REMAIN INDOORS.
all BIO PRESERVATION LOCKDOWNS ARE ENGAGED.
Jo, WHERE'S MY DAD?
these SUITS SHOULD PROTECT US
from THE NASTY LITTLE BUGGERS.
what DO YOU MEAN SHOULD?
you GUYS READY?
Roger DODGER, FARGO.
all RIGHT, ONCE YOU EXIT THE ELEVATOR,
radio SIGNALS WILL BE JAMMED BY THE BUILDING'S SECURITY SYSTEM
and WE'LL LOSE CONTACT.
you HAVE TO REACH THE MAIN COMMUNICATION CENTER IN SECTION FOUR.
if IT WASN'T DAMAGED BY THE CEILING COLLAPSE,
you SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTACT THE PANIC ROOM FROM THERE.
good LUCK, GUYS.
what DO YOU WANT WITH MY SON?
I THINK YOU KNOW, ALLISON.
you CERTAINLY WORKED HARD ENOUGH TO KEEP IT A SECRET.
you EVEN LOCKED HENRY OUT OF KIM'S LAB
when YOU THOUGHT HE MIGHT FIGURE IT OUT.
is THAT WHY YOU'VE DONE THIS, HENRY?
to GET BACK AT ME?
hmm. YOU KNOW WE SO WELL.
apparently I DON'T KNOW YOU AT ALL.
he's DOING THIS BECAUSE KEVIN NOW EMBODIES THE ARTIFACT.
he's THE CONDUIT TO THE AKASHIC FIELD.
and YOU PEOPLE ARE INCAPABLE
of HANDLING THIS KIND OF POWER RESPONSIBLY.
huh.
spoken BY THE WOMAN WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR KIM'S DEATH.
how CAN YOU TRUST HER AFTER WHAT SHE'S DONE?
because THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME, MORE IMPORTANT THAN KIM,
more IMPORTANT THAN ANY OF US.
Kevin IS CONNECTED TO SOMETHING
that NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED.
there HAVE BEEN ONLY A FEW OTHERS
who COULD ACCESS THE FIELD.
people WHO'S BRAINS WERE TUNED JUST RIGHT.
da VINCI, TESLA, EINSTEIN.
Kevin MAY OUTSHINE THEM ALL.
we NEED TIME WITH HIM TO SEE IF WE'RE RIGHT.
well, YOU HAVE A LOT OF TIME NOW.
this BUNKER IS STOCKED WITH ENOUGH SUPPLIES TO LAST A YEAR.
we're NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
okay, YOUR DAD IS WITH STARK AND TAGGART.
they HAD TO GO BACK INTO G. D.
Oh, MY GOD.
Dr. FARGO IS AT THE DOOR.
Hey, JO.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE STAYING AT STARK'S LAB.
I WAS, BUT IT WAS KIND OF CREEPY IN THERE.
I REALIZED I MAY HAVE A WAY TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH THE SHERIFF AND DR. STARK.
that's BEEN HERE THE WHOLE TIME?
did I FORGET TO MENTION IT?
uh, YEAH.
we USE S. A.R. A.H. TO SLIP IN THROUGH A BACKDOOR
once A BACKDOOR LINK'S ESTABLISHED,
there's NOTHING IN THAT BUILDING
I WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO.
I THINK YOU MEAN THERE'S NOTHING I WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO.
boys, THERE'S PLENTY OF BACKDOOR ACCESS FOR EVERYONE.
that DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.
okay, JUST MAKE IT HAPPEN.
you GOT ANYTHING YET?
not YET.
this SENSOR'S DESIGNED TO DETECT
any KNOWN STRAIN OF BACTERIA.
but IF IT'S A NEW ONE, IT MAY NOT PICK IT UP.
, VERY HELPFUL.
I THINK IT'S TO THE LEFT.
I'm PRETTY SURE IT'S TO THE RIGHT.
straight AHEAD, MATES.
I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD'VE GONE L
you MEAN RIGHT.
not HELPING.
a BACTERIA DID THIS?
well, THAT WAS BEFORE IT FOUND THE IRON IN OUR BLOOD
tastier THAN METAL.
looks LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO GO UP OVER THE TOP.
no, WE'LL BE ELECTROCUTED.
no, JUST DON'T TOUCH THE WIRES.
we'll HAVE BETTER ACCESS IF WE JUST GO UNDER.
Yeah, AND MORE UNSTABLE.
you're UNSTABLE IF YOU WANT TO GO
shut IT, BOTH OF YOU!
you're LIKE A COUPLE OF. LD WEN
I've DETERMINED THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE.
we're GOING UNDER.
I LOVE SMALL SPACES.
I HATE SMALL SPACES.
it's LIKE RETURNING TO THE WOMB.
it's A DISTURBING THOUGHT.
we NEED A BIGGER WOMB.
that's IT, I'M GOING UP OVER THE TOP--WHOA!
Aah!
well, THAT WAS EXCITING.
Carter... THANKS.
no PROBLEM.
you SAY THAT WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH
to HANDLE ACCESS TO THE AKASHIC FIELD.
what MAKES YOU ANY DIFFERENT?
it's NOT ME. IT'S THE GROUP I WORK WITH.
who ARE?
a CONSORTIUM OF PEOPLE
who HAVE THE WORLD'S BEST INTERESTS IN MIND.
we WILL GIVE KEVIN
all THE CARE AND PROTECTION HE NEEDS.
like HELL YOU WILL.
like I SAID, THERE'S NO WAY OUT OF HERE.
you AND I BOTH KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.
there IS ONE WAY OUT,
and YOUR SECURITY CODE CAN ACCESS IT.
no. NO?
one WAY OR THE OTHER, WE ARE TAKING YOUR SON!
communication ROOM'S DOWN PAST THE MORGUE.
I HATE THE MORGUE.
what's WRONG, CARTER?
you AFRAID THEY'RE GONNA WAKE UP?
Yeah, I THINK THEY'RE GONNA WAKE UP.
Dr. STARK?
is THAT YOU, FARGO?
Yes, SIR, I HACKED INTO
Ahem! WE HACKED INTO
the MAINFRAME USING S. A.R. A.H.
good THINKING, FARGO.
dad, GOING A BIT FAR
to CANCEL MY PARTY, DON'T YOU THINK?
Ah, YOU KNOW ME. THREE FEET, LUCAS.
get YOUR HANDS OFF HER.
how DID HE KNOW?
I KNOW EVERYTHING. JO?
Hey, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
uh, WE'RE NOT SURE,
but BEVERLY'S LOCKED DOWN THERE
and SHE MIGHT BE INVOLVED.
Hey, JO.
Hey, UH, TAG.
all RIGHT, WE CAN MONITOR YOUR VITALS NOW, AND HELP YOU NAVIGATE THE BUILDING.
um, CAN YOU PATCH US INTO THE PANIC ROOM?
argo NO, IT HAS AN ENCRYPTED PROTOCOL THAT ONLY THE D. O.D. HAS OUTSIDE ACCESS TO.
[alarm] AND THAVENN'TEE ABLE TO REACH THEM EITHER.
what IS THAT?
ane) IN I'M PICKTHG UPRE E WILESS READING.
one OF YOU IS LOSING PRESSURE.
better CHECK YOUR SUITS.
it's ME.
you've BEEN EXPOSED, MATE.
Dr. STARK? SAY SOMETHING.
a HYPODERMIC LASER?
this SHOULD STEM THE INFECTION.
and IF IT DOESN'T?
I'll BE A LOT THINNER.
Ow!
sorry.
let's KEEP GOING WHILE I STILL CAN.
Henry, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.
and YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING BAD TO HAPPEN TO YOUR SON.
now YOU KNOW HOW THIS ENDS IF YOU DON'T COOPERATE.
so PLEASE.
Dr. ALLISON BLAKE. IDENTITY CONFIRMED.
I'll BE RIGHT BACK, HONEY.
what IS THISplace IT'S A LAST RESORT ESCAPE UNIT FOR THE HEAD OF G. D. IN CASE OF A SECURITY BREACH.
the S. R.T.--SUBATOMIC RECONSTRUCTIVE TRANSPORT.
teleportation? MM-HMM.
but THIS IS A BANNED TECHNOLOGY.
all ACTIVE RESEARCH WAS OUTLAWED
by THE STOCKHOLM TREATY.
after THE PROTOTYPE WAS CREATED.
we NEVER DID HUMAN TRIALS.
yet, HERE IT IS AT YOUR DISPOSAL.
it's INTERESTING HOW YOU CAN SKIRT THE RULES
when IT BENEFITS YOU.
well, IT'S NOT BENEFITING ME AT THE MOMENT, IS IT?
does THE TECHNOLOGY REALLY WORK?
the LAST PRIMATE TRIALS WERE SUCCESSFUL.
it's DNA SPECIFIC.
essentially, IT RECONSTRUCTS YOU AT A DESTINATION POINT,
leaving YOUR FORMER BODY BEHIND,
like A SNAKE SHEDDING ITS SKIN.
where IS THE DESTINATION?
a FULLY STOCKED BUNKER ONE KILOMETER OUTSIDE OF TOWN.
but THAT'S ITS MAXIMUM RANGE.
the GREATER THE DISTANCE,
the GREATER THE RISK OF COMPLICATIONS.
and THERE WERE MANY MORE COMPLICATIONS AFTER YOU LEFT THE PROJECT.
you WANT TO DO THIS? BE MY GUEST.
God KNOWS HOW YOU'LL COME OUT ON THE OTHER END.
but THERE IS NO WAY THAT I'M LETTING YOU
put MY SON THROUGH THAT THING.
then SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR SON NOW.
it's HIS ONLY CHANCE.
all RIGHT, WE'RE IN. WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
you SHOULD SEE A COMPUTER CONSOLE AS YOU ENTER THE ROOM.
bring UP THE PANIC ROOM INTERCOM LINK.
that SHOULD PUT YOU IN DIRECT CONTACT.
Allison, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
Allison, ARE YOU THERE?
hang ON, I'M TRYING
to CIRCUMVENT THE SECURITY WALL.
try NOW.
something's JAMMING THE SIGNAL.
it's NOT WORKING.
something's WORKING.
Uh-oh.
what? WHAT "UH-OH?
I THINK YOU MADE IT MAD.
the SECURITY MAINFRAME IS A LEARNING SYSTEM,
and BECAUSE OF YOU IT'S GONE INTO DEFENSE MODE.
what KIND OF DEFENSE MODE?
that KIND.
move!
that's A MOTION-ACTIVATED PHOTON DEFENSE ARRAY.
they're SCREWED.
we CAN HEAR YOU.
sorry.
it LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN ACCESS THE WEAPON'S POWER SUPPLY THROUGH THE PANEL ON THE EAST WALL.
and THE WEST WALL. THERE ARE TWO PANELS.
one MAINFRAME AND A BACKUP POWER SUPPLY.
but YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN WITH THIS ONE.
we CAN'T GET THROUGH THE FIREWALL. DAMN IT.
two PANELS, THREE OF US. HOW HARD CAN THAT BE?
it's A NASTY BUGGER.
it'll CUT US DOWN LONG BEFORE WE REACH THE PANELS.
unless SOMEONE DRAWS ITS FIRE.
why DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THE SOMEONE?
any DAY, CARTER.
Yeah, YOU WANT TO CHANGE PLACES?
you JUST BE MY GUEST.
I CAN'T WATCH THIS.
just REMEMBER. SERPENTINE.
don't DIE...ONE.
Aah!
I'm HERE!
I'm HALFWAY!
I SAID SERPENTINE!
shut UP, TAGGART!
running OUT OF PLACES TO HIDE.
I've GOT MINE. TAGGART?
trying!
hang ON, I'M COMING!
I'm TRYING!
Unh! DAD!
I HATE THIS BUILDING.
you ALL RIGHT?
Yeah.
what NOW?
Shh. LISTEN.
what IS THAT?
um, GUYS...
we're PICKING UP HEAT SIGNATURES DOWN THE HALL FROM YOU.
where EXACTLY?
in, UM--IN THE MORGUE.
I SWEAR TO GOD,
if THIS THING TURNS INTO A ZOMBIE ATTACK,
I AM QUITTING.
you READY?
you WANT EVERY SINGLE SECOND.
is THAT A YES?
eh.
see, I TOLD YOU I HEARD GUNFIRE!
man, WHAT THE HELL ARE Y'ALL DOING HERE?
well, WE WERE TRYING TO ISOLATE OURSELVES
from EXPOSURE TO THE OUTBREAK.
that's FOR OPENING THE DOOR.
you've ISOLATED YOURSELF IN THE ROOM
where THE FLESH-EATING BACTERIA BEGAN.
FLESH-EATING?
flesh-eating.
is ANYONE SUFFERING ANY ILL EFFECTS?
no.
flesh SEEMS TO BE RIGHT WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.
it DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
they SHOULD ALL LOOK LIKE THIS BY NOW.
Henry SAID THIS WAS THE FIRST VICTIM.
no WAY A BACTERIA DID THIS.
I'd SAY ACID.
so DOES THIS MEAN WE'RE GOOD?
no.
this MEANS HENRY LIED.
about A LOT OF THINGS.
there ISN'T A BIOHAZARD!
this IS A HOAX.
why WOULD HENRY LIE ABOUT A DEADLY OUTBREAK?
to GET EVERYONE OUT OF THE BUILDING.
while HE AND BEVERLY WERE COMING IN.
he MUST'VE TRICKED THE COMPUTERS
to THINK THERE WAS A BIO-THREAT.
fargo, ARE YOU STILL THERE?
Yeah, WE ARE NOW,
but THE BUILDING'S SECURITY KEEPS SHUTTING US OUT.
what DO YOU SEE NOW?
the SENSORS STILL DETECT A BIOHAZARD,
and IT'S SPREADING THROUGH GLOBAL.
that's A PROBLEM.
Why? IT'S NOT REAL.
general MANSFIELD DOESN'T KNOW THAT.
and IF THE SYSTEM TELLS HIM THERE'S A THREAT,
he HAS TO TRUST IT.
he'll BE FORCED TO FOLLOW ALL BIOHAZARD PROTOCOLS,
and HE WILL ORDER A THERMAL CLEANING.
fargo, TRY TO GET THROUGH TO HIM.
we've GOTTA GET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF HERE.
well, I CAN TAKE THEM, SHERIFF.
by YOURSELF.
well, I THINK I CAN HANDLE A BUILDING.
Taggart, THIS BUILDING IS IN DEFENSE MODE.
it's NOT GONNA LET YOU JUST WALK OUT OF HERE.
I WELCOME THE CHALLENGE.
all RIGHT, TROOPS.
let's MOVE OUT!
we ARE SO DEAD.
I HEARD THAT.
I'd LIKE TO SPEAK TO KEVIN ALONE FOR A MINUTE.
I'd LIKE YOU TO GO STRAIGHT TO HELL.
trade YOU FAVORS.
we're ALMOST READY.
Henry, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
why ARE YOU DOING THIS?
I LOST THE ONE PERSON I TRULY LOVED.
trust ME, THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO FEEL.
there's STILL ONE THING I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.
just ONE THING?
well, YOU BROUGHT BEVERLY HERE IN SECRET BECAUSE
well, BECAUSE YOU'RE A HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING.
but WHY DID ALLIE GO ALONG WITH IT?
did YOU EVER THINK MAYBE SHE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT ME?
no, THAT'S NOT IT.
unless SHEAS TRYING TO PROTECT KEVIN THOUGH.
she SAID HE WAS CHANGING. IT SCARED HER.
that's WHY YOU AND SHE WERE WORKING ON THE DREAM SCANNER.
look, CARTER...
?? WHEN THE ARTIFACT EXPLODED.
we HOPED HE DIDN'T GET EXPOSED, BUT HE DID.
but HE DIDN'T...
burst INTO FLAMES OR
he's NOT WIRED LIKE ANYBODY ELSE.
in FACT, SOMEHOW HE CONNECTED TO IT.
he CAN CONTROL THE ENERGY.
and I'M AFRAID IT'S GONNA DESTROY HIM.
so I'VE BEEN DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
to DISCONNECT HIM FROM IT.
disconnect.
all YOU'VE EVER WANTED TO DO WAS CONNECT WITH IT.
Yeah, YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT NOT AT THE RISK OF KEVIN.
there's NOTHING I WOULDN'T DO FOR HIM.
or ALLIE.
then, UM, PROTECT THEM.
I WILL.
biohazard DETECTED, SECTION THREE.
Oh, GOD!
please TELL ME YOU HAVE A PLAN TO GET US OUT OF HERE.
relax, MATE. I ALWAYS HAVE A PLAN.
so, FARGO, STILL WITH US?
YEAHFOR THE MOMENT,
but THE CONNECTION'S INTERMITTENT .
fargo IS YOUR BRILLIANT PLAN?
Hey, YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE ME, LARRY.
Adios, MUCHACHOS!
good, I'D RATHER LET THE COMPUTER DEFENSES TAKE CARE OF YOU ANYWAY.
what? WHAT? WHAT?
what?
kidding.
we've CONTACTED MANSFIELD TO CALL OFF THE THERMAL CLEANING ??
that's YOUR BEST WAY OUT.
I-I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
well THEN, WHO DID?
Damn!
this THING'S GOOD.
the DEFENSE SYSTEM CAPTURED YOUR VOICE
to MISLEAD THEM.
they CAN'T HEAR US ANYMORE.
don't LISTEN TO ME!
fargo, YOU STILL THERE?
sure AM. YOU'RE DOING JUST GREAT.
it's NOT FAR NOW, TAG.
only JO CALLS ME THAT.
that ZANE SEEMS LIKE A NICE ENOUGH FELLA.
he AND JO MAKE A HANDSOME COUPLE, DON'T YOU THINK?
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.
ha! THEY'RE REPULSIVE!
the REAL FARGO WOULD KNOW THAT.
you'll NEVER FIND YOUR WAY OUT.
resistance IS FUTILE.
Oh, MY GOD! WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.
relax, MATE.
he's FALLEN FOR ONE OF THE CLASSIC BLUNDERS.
what's THAT?
never GO IN AGAINST AN AUSTRALIAN
when DEATH IS ON THE LINE.
what ARE YOU DOING?
I've TRACKED POLAR BEAR ACROSS THE ARCTIC TUNDRA
in A BLIZZARD.
it's ALL ABOUT THE INTUITION, MATE.
this WAY!
just DIDN'T EXPECT SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
you JUST DON'T KNOW HENRY.
Yeah, BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
I MEAN, WHY WOULD HE SHUT DOWN GLOBAL?
why WOULD HE GET LOCKED HIMSELF IN A ROOM
with BEVERLY WHEN THERE'S NO WAY OUT?
because THERE IS A WAY OUT.
when I FIRST BROUGHT HENRY TO EUREKA,
I WAS WORKING ON A SUBATOMIC RECONSTRUCTIVE
transport CHAMBER.
do I REALLY HAVE TO ASK? TELEPORTATION.
basically, IT REBUILDS A BODY TO A NEW LOCATION USING ESSENTIAL DNA MARKERS.
and ONE OF THE BYPRODUCTS OF THE PROCESS
is THE ABILITY TO FILTER OUT CONTAMINANTS
or HEALTH HAZARDS.
what, SO IF I GO IN WHEN I'M SICK
I COME OUT HEALTHY?
exactly.
Oh, NO.
essentially, IT COULD SEPARATE KEVIN FROM THE AKASHIC FIELD.
but KEVIN'S DNA HAS BEEN FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERED.
Henry NEEDS BOTH PROFILES,
but HE DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS
to KEVIN'S ORIGINAL DNA PROFILE.
so WHAT HAPPENS IF KEVIN GOES THROUGH NOW?
is IT ME, OR IS IT GETTING HOT IN HERE?
it's THE BUILDING.
microwave ANTIPERSONNEL DEFENSE.
Oh, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD.
Fargo! FARGO, OPEN THE DOOR!
how DO WE SHUT IT OFF?
I DESIGNED IT. I DIDN'T INSTALL IT.
you've GOTTA SHUT IT DOWN.
we're TRYING. IT'S ANTICIPATING EVERY ATTACK.
then CHANGE TACTICS.
you've GOT A BETTER IDEA, I'M ALL EARS.
we HAVE TO PROVIDE A DNA PROFILE
for THE S. R.T. TO BUILD ON.
okay.
just MINE?
no, I'LL BE DOING THIS FOR EACH OF US.
there WE GO.
so THAT'S ME. THAT'S YOU.
Yeah, YOU CAN HARDLY SEE THE CLOVEN HOOVES AND HORNS.
you KNOW, I'M REALLY NOT THE DEVIL, ALLISON.
if ANYTHING, I'M TRYING TO PROTECT KEVIN
from PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE.
what PEOPLE? THE D. O.D. THE C. I.A.
come ON, ONCE THEY FIND OUT WHAT HE CAN DO, AND THEY WILL,
he WILL BE A LAB RAT FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.
is THAT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT?
do YOU WANT TO DO THIS OR SHALL I?
attention. INTRUDER ALERT.
attention.
attention. INTRUDER ALERT.
attention.
Kevin, HONEY.
remember THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN YOU READ MY MIND?
Yes. CAN YOU DO IT TO OTHERS?
can YOU FEEL IF THERE ARE OTHERS COMING TO HELP US?
y ES. THEY'RE COMING.
the COMPUTER'S BEEN LYING TO US.
what IF WE LIE TO IT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
well, ITS GOAL IS TO ELIMINATE THE THREAT.
so LET'S DO IT FIRST.
you WANT US TO KILL THEM?
just MAKE THEM APPEAR DEAD.
those ARE THEIR VITAL SIGNS, RIGHT?
the SECURITY SYSTEM IS PICKING THEM UP.
Yeah, SO?
can YOU CHANGE THEM?
maybe WE CAN.
you MEAN, IF YOU MAKE IT THINK THEY'RE ALREADY DEAD, IT'LL STOP COOKING THEM?
let's HOPE.
I've GOT DR. STARK'S VITALS READY.
and I'VE GOT THE SHERIFF'S SO DO IT.
numbers DROPPING.
approaching CRITICAL.
that's IT!
as FAR AS THE COMPUTER CAN TELL, THEY'RE DEAD.
it's NOT WORKING. GIVE IT A MINUTE.
they DON'T HAVE A MINUTE!
come ON, COME ON, COME ON.
Yes!
this DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE FRIENDS NOW, DOES IT?
hell, NO. COOL.
you OKAY? YEAH.
never BUY ANOTHER TV DINNER, BUT--YEAH.
come ON.
access TO THE PANIC ROOM IS RIGHT DOWN HERE.
nice INVENTION.
it's TIME.
Henry, HOW CAN YOU ASK ME TO DO THIS?
he's MY SON.
I'm ASKING YOU BECAUSE HE'S YOUR SON.
it's THE ONLY WAY. FOR HIM.
don't WORRY, KEVIN. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.
not FOR EVERYONE.
I KNOW THIS IS UNBELIEVABLY HARD,
but YOU'RE MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE.
I KNOW I AM.
that WAS THE WRONG CHOICE.
stay AWAY FROM HIM, YOU BITCH!
Unh!
you HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE SACRIFICING.
I KNOW I'M NOT SACRIFICING--MY SON.
Unh!
Allison, WAIT!
Henry, YOU PUSH THAT BUTTON, AND I WILL KILL YOU.
let ME EXPLAIN.
why WOULD I TRUST ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY?
mom, WAIT.
listen TO HIM. PLEASE.
could WE GET ANY CLOSER?
room STOPS 100 FEET BELOW THE LOWEST LEVEL OF GLOBAL.
we'll HAVE TO CLIMB THE REST OF THE WAY DOWN.
Yeah, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY LET ME GO FIRST.
Why?
heights MAKE ME NAUSEOUS.
after YOU.
GOHA.
I'm NOT WORKING WITH BEVERLY.
there IS NO FLESH-EATING BACTERIA.
I REPROGRAMMED G. D.'S SECURITY SENSORS
into THINKING THERE WAS.
Why? I KNEW THAT YOU AND NATHAN WERE TRYING TO SEPARATE KEVIN FROM THE AKASHIC FIELD.
I REALIZED WHEN I SAW THE ALCHEMY FORMULA
that THE S. R.T. CHAMBER WAS THE WAY TO DO IT.
why DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?
I TRIED, BUT YOU AND NATHAN FROZE ME OUT.
you DIDN'T TRUST ME.
almost THERE, CARTER.
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE SO RELIEVED
you OKAY? YEAH, YEAH.
I'll FEEL BETTER WHEN WE GET INSIDE.
Hey, CARTER, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
I, UH, APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.
let's DO THIS.
only TWO MORE FIREWALLS AND WE'RE IN CONTROL OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM.
damn, I'M GOOD.
for YEARS I'VE WONDERED
what GOES ON INSIDE OF HIS HEAD.
is IT WHAT YOU HOPED FOR?
better.
I KNOW THAT HE'S HAPPY,
and THAT'S ALL I'VE EVER WANTED.
hmm.
Henry, IF THIS WORKS,
will HE BE LIKE HE IS NOW, OR...
how HE USED TO BE?
his AUTISM IS LIKELY TO RETURN.
I'll BE FINE, MOM.
don't BE DISAPPOINTED.
honey, IT'S OKAY.
all I CARE ABOUT IS THAT YOU'RE SAFE.
see YOU IN A MINUTE.
okay.
don't DO IT, HENRY.
we HAVE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNIVERSE AT OUR FINGERTIPS.
it COULD BE CENTURIES
before SOMEONE ELSE CONNECTS TO THE FIELD.
think ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS, HENRY.
what WE COULD LEARN.
it's LIKE YOU SAID. WE AREN'T READY.
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THIS.
or WHAT, YOU'LL DO TO ME WHAT YOU DID TO KIM?
if THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES.
Beverly, DP IT
Henry, NOT YOU!
this COULD SAVE HIM. IT WILL KILL HIM.
you DON'T HAVE ALL THE DATA.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHAT DATA?
his KB-201 FILE. IT HAS HIS ORIGINAL DNA.
you NEED BOTH PROFILES.
which I WOULD'VE TOLD YOU IF YOU'D BOTHER TO COME TO ME.
I DID, AND YOU REFUSED MY HELP.
so THIS IS HOW YOU DECIDE TO FIX IT?
to PUT ALL THESE INNOCENT LIVES AT RISK?
and SHE'S HOW YOU DECIDE TO FIX IT?
all RIGHT, THIS STOPS NOW!
everybody JUST...
take A BREATH.
this IS OVER.
no, CARTER, IT'S NOT.
Kevin WILL DIE IF I DON'T DO THIS NOW.
I've BEEN TRACKING HIS MUTATIONS.
the AKASHIC FIELD'S TAKING OVER HIS BRAIN.
?? HENRY'S RIGHT.
the S. R.T. IS OUR ONLY WAY TO SEPARATE HIM FROM IT.
this IS YOUR CALL.
Allie, PULL UP THE FILE.
you ALL ARE ABOUT TO MAKE A MISTAKE
of BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS.
wouldn't BE THE FIRST TIME.
I've RECALIBRATED THE DESTINATION COORDINATES RIGHT BACK TO THIS ROOM.
the MARKERS ARE SET.
let's DO THIS.
I LOVE YOU, BABY.
two... I LOVE YOU TOO, MOM.
he SHOULD BE RIGHT HERE.
where IS MY SON?
Allie, HIS BODY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROCESS
Oh!
[sobbing] NO, BABY!
Mom???
Oh, MY GOD!
Oh, ARE YOU OKAY?
get A BLANKET.
here.
we GOTTA SHUT THIS DOWN
or THERE'S GONNA BE A THERMAL CLEANING.
I CAN'T, SOMETHING'S OVERRIDING MY CONTROL.
ha, TAKE THAT!
general, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.
the VIRUS IS A FAKE.
and THERE ARE PEOPLE INSIDE WHO WILL DIE
if YOU DO THIS.
you ARE ASKING ME TO TRUST YOU
over THE MOST SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER SYSTEM IN THE WORLD.
I'm ASKING YOU TO TRUST ALL OF US.
only ONE FIREWALL LEFT.
Oh, I WANT TO, DEPUTY.
but THERE ARE STRICT PROTOCOLS IN PLACE.
as A SOLDIER, YOU SHOULD APPRECIATE THAT.
great LEADERS KNOW IN COMBAT
you SOMETIMES HAVE TO BREAK PROTOCOLS, SIR.
you OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD APPRECIATE THAT.
it JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
it's LIKE SOMEONE ON THE OUTSIDE IS
Oh, NO. FARGO.
I'm GIVING HER ALL SHE'S GOT, GENERAL.
boo YA! LAST WALL DOWN!
that's IT! RESETTING THE SYSTEM NOW.
Yes!
way TO STICK TO YOUR GUNS, DEPUTY.
well DONE.
thank YOU, SIR.
you WERE AMAZING.
thank YOU.
ready TO GET BACK TO YOUR PARTY AGAIN?
I REALLY AM. YEAH.
not BAD.
not BAD YOURSELF.
you DID GREAT.
you did great.
system's reset. Nice work, fargo.
what the hell? Beverly, no!
damn it, her dna's alreadyprogrammed in the system.
she reprogrammed the coordinates.
she could be anywhere now.
she'll be found.
no, she won'T.
and...it doesn'tmatter now.
holy crap. I did it!
[Laughing]Thank you!
Oh, thank you.
Dr. Blake.
you all right?
Yes, sir.
with everyone'shelp here.
Where's beverly barlowe?
she's dead. Not much left.
and we'll dealwith this internally.
I would love to know who's responsiblefor all this.
I am.
Hey.
Hey.
how's kevin?
well, he slepttill noon, but he's backto his old self.
thanks to you.
I promised youI'd take care of him.
I'll never be ableto thank you enough, nathan.
I don't wantyour thanks, allie.
I want you.
I almost lost you both.
and I'm tiredof pretending that I'm okaywith us being apart.
I'm not. Nathan
you and kevinare my family.
and I won't be happyuntil we're together.
marry me, allie.
again.
ready?
as you can see, my escort's already here.
just puttingthe last few things in order.
is there anythingI can do?
no, I mean, they have to dowhat they have to do, because I did what I did.
and I'm willingto pay the price for it.
good.
you know, you ended upsaving kevin's life.
I'm sure they'll take thatinto consideration.
but that's not for usto decide, remember?
no, it's not.
you're not alone. You have friends.
ahem
by THIS WAY
there's an unexpected visitor at the door.
that's auntie Lex!
shall I let her in?
No! - Yes!
a wedding gift for Ally.
none of us may make it through the next time wave.
I'll see you around, Jack.
he's gone.
are you strangling something?
Oh, sorry.
is the music too loud?
that's music?
Yes, I composed it in India.
it's supposed to relieve stress.
Really?
Yeah, not working.
give it a chance.
sometimes you have to let art flow over you before you can appreciate it.
I'll make you a copy for your car.
take your time.
you sure you should be doing that in your condition?
yoga's good for the pregnancy.
and since I don't have a lamaze partner...
you might if you told the father.
he's halfway across the world.
curing cholera.
where he belongs.
this baby is my choice.
all right.
you want some coffee?
dad, you okay?
Yep!
sorry.
I rearranged a few things.
for a smart house, the feng shui was really dumb.
no offense, S.A. R.A. H.
none taken, it's really opened up my flow.
what's in my coffee?
soy milk.
aunt Lexi says that lactose gives you gas.
Oh, Lex also says that her cat is grandma Lil.
same old Jack.
you always hated change.
Yeah, and you're always trying to fix things that aren't broken.
so you're telling me that everything in your life is perfect?
nothing could be improved just a tiny bit?
well, no.
um, when are you leaving?
God, I wish I had a sibling.
Oh, problem at G. D..
so no more feng or shui.
I don't think the lettering is big enough.
fargo, if it was any bigger, it'd cover the whole building.
your point is?
Hey, guys.
you seen thorne?
section three at the big tomb opening.
there's a protester in the preservation lab.
what if we changed the font?
what's the plan in here?
we're turning this into the Nathan Stark memorial hallway.
I was hoping for it to be done before Dr. Blake returned, but...
close.
Allison's back already?
she said she was feeling better.
Henry, I'm gonna go grab the other color swatches.
come on, I can show you where Thorne is.
don't do anything until I get back.
wouldn't think of it.
here we go.
sheriff, finally.
nice to see you too.
what's, uh, the problem?
these people have no respect for the past.
that's the problem.
you know that isn't true.
we're only attempting this project because of our fascination with history.
and Dr. Wildingis standing in the way of progress, literally.
I want him arrested.
and you are?
Dr. Sebastian Marx, archaeologist.
I'm sure you've seen some of my documentaries.
you're a disgrace to the discipline.
Dr. Wilding is our resident egyptologist.
sheriff, they can't beallowed to open this tomb.
that's a tomb?
for Queen Nyota.
Eureka had a queen.
uh, no, sheriff carter, we brought the whole tomb from Egypt.
had to use a superconductor to generate a massive antigravitational field.
it's protected by a thermoplastic multi-filament polymer.
Oh, air bags.
thank you.
couldn't you just open it when you were in Egypt?
not under perfectly controlled environmental conditions.
here we can use a metasomatic ray to protect the rock composition so the tomb won't crumble when we expose it.
I mean, this is gonna bean unprecedented achievement.
then we'll send it out on an interactive 3-d world tour that will make king tutlook tame.
Dr. Wilding... if you won't listen to me, listen to them.
the message on that door is a warning.
those are the symbols for danger and death.
you mean like a curse?
curse, legend, lore.
I mean, this tomb has it all.
inside, a doomed queen lies shrouded in the cloud of darkness.
a queen who vows to one day rise again.
I think I just gave myself the chills.
um, I am really, really sorry, but these people have a job to do.
and I don't want to have to take you in.
fine.
I've conveyed their warning.
I strongly suggest.
that you listen.
I warned you.
thank you, sheriff.
I knew I could count on you.
Oh, just be careful.
it's all fun and games till someone gets cursed.
heard you were back.
Yeah, just, uh, trying to catch up on everything.
Yeah.
you sure you're ready?
I mean, it's only been a couple weeks.
Yeah, I'm fine.
it... keeping busy, you know, it helps.
but I appreciate you checking in on me.
listen, um.
I have somethingfor you, but I'm not sure if now is the right time.
what is it?
it's, uh.
a wedding present from Stark...Nathan.
he, uh, asked me to give it to you.
I could've waited.
no, it's, uh.
Thanks.
okay.
power sequence initiated.
metasomatic ray activated.
tomb pressure equalized.
now the tomb has been untouched for 3, 000 years.
now, we must take care to protect this holy site from being contaminated by our presence.
to ensure that Queen Nyota's body and spiritare preserved forever.
come along.
Yes, yes, look at that.
it's wondrous.
this is wondrous!
Eileen, are you getting this?
you stepped out of your light.
what?
why didn't...why didn't you say anything?
well... okay, look, we gotta start from the top.
is this guy for real?
you have to admire anyone who can bring the wonder of scientific discovery to the masses.
especially if the masses will pay top dollar to see it?
doesn't hurt.
we've just removed the cover.
and there she is.
queen Nyota, entirely intact.
now the linen that once enshrouded her has completely dissolved, but the queen herself lives on in all her splendid glory.
will the legend come true?
will the queen rise again to walk the night?
only time will tell.
fargo, I swear, if this a joke...
it was the mummy queen, and she tried to strangle me.
you've seen too many horror movies.
Hello?
any mummy home?
we've desecrated her tomb and woke her up, and now she's out for revenge.
go find Zane!
he's the one you want.
relax, Fargo.
you can't wake the dead unless you play my sister's music.
Oh, god! Queen Nyota got him.
no, it's Dr. Marx.
Dr. Marx?
Dr. Marx?
he's alive.
he's not the only one.
the sarcophagus.
the mummy's gone.
is that you?
I will always love you.
what happened?
you passed out, Sebastian.
probably dehydration.
after two weeks in the desert and all day in the tomb, it's no surprise.
can I have some water, please?
was it the mummy?
did you see her?
fargo, come on.
Oh, no.
the mummy.
my queen is gone.
Yeah.
so you don't know where she is?
no.
I went to dinner.
when I came back to get more footage, the sarcophagus was empty.
it must've been your egyptologist, Wilding.
we have to get her back.
I'm telling you, it's the curse.
uh, Fargo says that he saw the mummy in, uh, Stark's memorial hallway.
it has nothing to do with that.
I know what I saw.
the queen is alive, and I'm gonna prove it.
marx accused me.
you should arrest him for slander.
well, you did make quite a scene.
disturbing Queen Nyota's remains goes against everything I stand for.
Yeah, and yet Marx did it anyway.
that doesn't mean I'd resort to desecration to make my point.
I respect the ancient egyptians far too much for that.
you know they're dead, right?
they were the first scientists.
they should be honored for their achievements, not turned into a circus sideshow.
okay, well, what can you tell me about Sebastian Marx?
it's not even his real name.
it's Paco Lopez.
and he's been involvedin more than one scandal.
I'll say.
bribing customs officials.
transporting sacred relics without proper permits.
tomb raiding.
marx sold out long ago.
he cares about the spectacle, not science.
well, a resurrected mummy would build a lot of hype for his little movie.
I wouldn't put it past him.
Yeah, but a mummy hoax?
still though, Fargo said that he saw something.
fargo is afraid of his own shadow.
given his state of mind...
Yeah, but still, we should talk to Marx again.
well, he's doing a book signing at cafe diem.
it's part of Vincent's pharaoh-palooza event.
all right.
Pharaoh-palooza?
is nothing sacred?
greetings, fellow egyptians.
enjoy this nectar of the Nile.
thank you, pharaoh.
nice costume.
so where's Marx?
that is a good question.
he's an hour late for his own booking signing.
Oh, celebrities can be such prima donnas.
is this coffee?
with pomegranate creamer in it.
it's pharaoh-licious.
it's disgusting.
can I get some real milk, like...like from a cow?
Absolutely.
I shall resurrect some from the tomb.
that would be the freezer.
I love theme day.
sheriff, prepare to be proven wrong.
are you drinking this?
no, enjoy.
is that blood?
fish blood.
herring, to be exact.
fargo, people are trying to eat.
the cells were found in a fossil pocket in the paleontology lab.
they're thousands of years old.
so it's dead fish blood.
not dead, regenerated.
a geology experiment brought the cells back to life.
Oh, but how, you ask?
metasomatic rays.
just like they used to open the tomb.
and you think a few fish cells proves that the mummy was resurrected.
you can't ignore the evidence, sheriff.
here, take a closer look.
they're alive.
and they smell.
Yeah, I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, scratch that.
now I'm gonna be sick.
Hi, guys. Do you like it? I have free copies.
did you compose this?
Mm-hmm, it soothes the soul on a wide range of frequencies, and there's a whole lot of tension in this room.
especially from that area.
I'll say.
tell you what, sis.
you want to relieve some stress?
talk to Fargo.
he's got some serious mummy issues.
come on, let's go see Marx at the b&B.
wait, take this.
take it for the drive.
you need it.
all right.
so.
tell me about your mother.
you do nice work, Dr. Deacon.
Eva, hey.
Oh, how's it going with that missing mummy?
Oh, the sheriff's on the case.
I'm sure she'll be home soon.
all right, anything I can do to help, just let me know.
actually, there is one thing.
do you have any idea what this is?
a cryptex.
wow, it's like a type of combination lock.
although I don't recognize the symbols.
do you think you could open it?
where did you find this?
in an alternate location for the hotel I want to build.
first it's baryogenic radiation, and now it's this.
what are you looking for?
unfortunately, the details are classified.
that is unfortunate.
so I guess I'm gonna have to find another way.
marx has been staying here since he got to town.
Dr. Marx, it's sheriff Carter!
you sure he's in there?
no one's seen him leave since he came in last night.
he say anything?
no, just asked for some water.
how much water?
Dr. Marx!
this place is a sauna.
more like a tomb.
I think we found our mummy.
that's not our mummy .
that's Marx.
sheriff, Allison.
is Sebastian really dead?
really dead.
I'm afraid he makes Queen Tyota look good.
what happened?
we don't know yet.
Henry's quarantined the body while he does an autopsy.
quarantined?
does he think this is an infection?
well, the rapid deterioration of the body is similar to flesh-eating bacteria.
well, Sebastian just got back from Egypt.
maybe he picked something up there.
or from the tomb with the fancy "danger" signson the door.
maybe we should've listened to Wilding.
anything?
the body is severely drained of all its fluids.
well, how do you die of dehydration in a tubful of water?
aggressive bacterialinfection.
fungal spores, poison.
poison?
so this could've been deliberate?
because Dr. Wilding was very upset yesterday.
no, it wasn't him. I spoke to him.
it's, uh, it's not in his nature.
and more than likely it's spread through contact.
if it had been air borne, we would've seen more victims.
was anyone else in the tomb with him?
just his camerawoman, and I haven't heard from her since yesterday.
Jo and I are on it.
what about the missing mummy?
shouldn't we be more concerned about who killed your friend?
that's my only concern, sheriff.
if the mummy's infectious, more lives are at risk.
we've already lost one great scientist today.
I don't want to lose another.
excuse me.
Oh, dear.
I will never leave you again.
Allison, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm, uh... I just thought I... yeah, I'm fine.
sorry.
listen.
I know what you're going through.
I lost my husband too.
Oh, I'm sorry.
it was a long time ago.
but still, I know how difficult it is.
and there'll always be reminders.
and the hard truth is, you can get past it, but you'll never get over it, even if you have all the time in the world.
I just want you to know you're not alone.
Thanks.
marx's camerawoman, Eileen Michaels.
professional documentarian.
she's been with Marx for the entire excavation.
and you haven't seen her since yesterday?
she left early.
said she wasn't feeling well.
apparently she never made it back to the hotel.
can you see when she logged out of the building?
she, uh, didn't.
according to security, she's still here.
let's hope she hasn't ended up like Marx.
about that.
I've been doing some research.
these are hieroglyphics from inside the tomb.
they're an obscure dialect, but I think they're describing a plague.
you mean like a disease?
maybe Marx got infected inside the tomb.
all right, well, call Wilding.
we need to know exactly what those symbols mean.
I'll keep looking for Eileen.
not to be all doom and gloom, but if she's still alive, wouldn't someone have seen her by now?
maybe someone already has.
okay, show me where she was.
um, right over there, but I really don't think we should be in here.
what if the mummy comes back?
I don't think that's what you saw.
well, you said you believed me.
no, I believe you saw someone last night, but just not the walking dead out for revenge.
tell that to Dr. Marx.
Henry hasn't finished the autopsy, but it seems that Dr. Marx was killed by an infection.
some kind of dehydration sickness.
so it makes.
you need.
water.
Oh, hey, what are you...don't go in there!
it's not done yet!
this looks bad.
Oh, come on, you're not getting the full effect.
you gotta imagine colored lights, and pink water lilies, some koi.
all right, Fargo, I don't think you want to see this.
what?
it's the mummy queen!
no.
it's Eileen Michaels.
well, the camerawoman was here the whole time.
she was in the fountain.
she must've gotten in there after Fargo ran, like Marx in the bathtub.
that curse got her.
we're all doomed.
for the last time, there is no curse.
then where's the mummy queen?
I'm working on it.
I'm ordering tests on all G. D. employees, make sure no one else is infected.
well, she and Marx were the only ones who actually had physical contact with the mummy.
that we know of someone took her.
who knows how many more people are at risk?
how many more people are gonna die?
okay.
okay, well, we'll do the tests.
we'll keep our eyes open for the signs.
and what are the signs, exactly?
I don't... uh, being really, really thirsty?
so that's what we're depending on?
people are dying Carter!
are you okay?
I'm... I'm fine.
it's... come on, talk to me.
okay, look, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I swear I keep hearing...Fargo!
what?
Oh, no.
I knew that stupid curse would get me too.
don't worry, Fargo.
we're gonna take care of you.
Oh, sure, like you took care of Dr. Marx and Eileen Michaels?
you're not gonna end up like that.
how did he get infected?
apparently Eileen touched him on the neck before he ran off.
we're checking everyone that Fargo came into contact with first.
make sure no one else has any symptoms.
Yeah, and Wilding and Zane are trying to learn what they can from the symbols inside the tomb.
that's gonna take time.
Where's Henry?
he's doing an autopsy of Eileen Michaels, but if that doesn't provide some answers, we're in trouble.
let's hope it does.
she just disintegrated before I could even get started.
without water to keep her hydrated, her body just turned to dust.
well, that didn't happen to Marx.
no, he was different.
I found hundreds of small masses inside his stomach, growths of some kind.
that's pleasant.
tumors?
not that I'd ever seen before.
I'm gonna keep testing.
all right, well, check Fargo's blood against Marx's.
we only have a couple hours if we're gonna save him.
we need to find out what kind of infection we're dealing with.
all right, and I'll work on finding out what the symbols to the tomb mean.
maybe there's a cure for the plague, whatever it is.
all right.
any progress?
some.
see, every language has its pattern.
it's just a matter of cracking the code.
Zane's been helping me by filling in the blanks where the symbols have faded over time.
I've always been a puzzle guy.
well done.
so, did, um, queen what's-her-name die from this?
no.
the high priests apparently killed her themselves to save her from the plague.
not exactly a cure we can use on Fargo.
there's still pieces that we don't understand.
like this symbol.
it keeps popping up over and over again.
that looks likea few clouds.
I still don't understand who could've taken the queen out of here without anybody noticing.
there's nothing on the video.
no security breach.
it's like she vanished into thin air.
maybe because she did.
I think the reason why we can't figure out where the queen went is because she's been right here all along.
well, this is different.
potassium, 35%.
carbon, 18%.
phosphorous, 1.0. Calcium. 1.5.
sheriff, you're right.
it's all organic matter.
it's human remains.
how did you know?
Henry said that Eileen had turned to dust.
I figured maybe the queen had as well.
if you'd only heeded the warning.
well, at least nobody else had contact with her.
so this should be contained.
Yeah.
to Fargo.
how do I look?
is that supposed to cheer me up?
just hang in there, Fargo.
I mean, Henry's still working on it, and we haven't given up.
neither should you.
I though you said rehydrating him would help.
it should, but the more fluids we give him, the weaker he gets.
all right, if you stop?
he dies of dehydration.
here, look at his blood.
these are microbes.
they're replicating at an incredible rate.
they look like.
little bugs.
it's not like any bacteria I've ever encountered.
what if we're thinking of the wrong kind of plague?
what do you mean?
well, so far we've been thinking about the disease kind.
what if it's.
an insect kind?
you think Fargo's been invaded by microscopic insects?
well, he showed me this fish blood that had been regenerated by a meta-whatever ray.
could the same thing happen to some ancient kind of bug?
well, under certain conditions, insects can enter cryptobiosis.
it's a natural state of suspended animation.
they can survive indefinitely until rehydrated.
like...like sea monkeys?
same principle.
Oh, which explains why rehydrating Fargo is making him worse.
the insects are multiplying.
and what if they're exposed to a large amount of water?
like, say, an over flowing bathtub?
it could speed metamorphosis, like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly.
okay, take care of Fargo. I gotta warn Henry.
Henry, I need you to get out here right away!
Hey, we need to lock down that tent, make sure nothing can get out.
well, nothing can.
it's designed to contain the tiniest of microbes.
well, what about something bigger?
how much bigger?
quite a bit.
why couldn't it have been butterflies?
all right, Jo, keep everyone inside.
they're heading your way.
there's nothing left of Marx.
Yeah, except what's flying towards town.
we gotta keep them contained.
let's get back to G.D.
can't do this alone.
it's a swarm.
that's what the cloud stands for.
Yeah, what kind of threat is it?
the bugs lay eggs, hatch larvae, and then seek out new hosts.
us.
well, how did the ancient egyptians deal with the problem?
they killed the infected and burned their city to the ground.
let's call that plan B.
according to our guys in entomology, these bugs are going to grow exponentially now that they've emerged.
hold on, how could the bugs grow in Marx but not Eileen?
probably incubation.
to fully develop, the larvae need water.
Yeah, but they were both in water.
I mean, Eileen was in the fountain, Marx was in the tub.
so maybe there was something in the fountain that killed the larvae before they could under go metamorphosis.
I'll go test the water.
sorry.
Hey, Zoe, just stay in doors.
we got a little bit of a bug problem.
a little bug problem?
stay away from the windows, people!
looks pretty big from where I am.
what happened to the lights?
they must've gotten to the circuit breaker.
I can't hear you.
can you turn that down?
aunt Lex, kill the boombox.
the bug swarm is huge and.
it's leaving.
turn it back on.
tell Lex to turn the music back on.
dad wants the music back on.
I knew he'd come around.
it's weird.
they're...they're coming back.
okay, keep the doors closed, keep the music on, and hang tight.
it's Lexi's music.
the bugs actually like it.
it could be the harmonic frequencies.
Yeah, or they have no taste.
I mean, the point is that we can attract them.
so how do we kill them before they lay any eggs?
well, without gas sing the town, I have no idea.
well, even then they could be resistant to traditional pesticides.
all right, well, what killed the bugs in Eileen Michaels?
did you test the fountain?
Yeah, purified water.
not even chlorine.
well, what about the ph levels?
oxygenation, alkalinity?
all completely normal.
just regular H2O.
I mean, no different than the water that Marx was found in.
no, Marx was founding hot water.
the bathroom was filled with steam.
Yeah, but the fountain water comes from an underground spring.
it's ice cold.
so maybe the bugs can't take the cold?
that's a reasonable hypothesis, and we have the perfect way to test it.
save Fargo, save the town.
wait, wait.
it's okay, Fargo.
maybe for you.
just let us take care of you.
the anesthesia's taking effect.
and.
he's out.
we're ready.
okay, his vitalsare really weak, so let's take it slow.
starting cryo-freeze.
now.
how long till we know?
until I can confirm all the larvae inside of him have been frozen to death?
will, uh.
will he be all right?
if he doesn't freeze to death first.
internal sensors are still detecting movement.
okay, almost there.
no more movement.
so they're dead?
or they could just be hibernating?
that's what we're gonna find out.
bring Fargo out.
defrost sequence.
underway.
still no change.
fargo, don't you die on me.
still not moving.
w-wait.
wait a minute.
pulse rate 45.
normal rate and rhythm. He's coming back to us.
still no movement.
that's it.
they're dead!
so.
he's okay?
I swear I almost lost it there for a moment.
Yeah.
and now I have.
I will always love you.
I see him too.
so do I.
when you moved your hand from your necklace.
is...is that a logic diamond?
uh, yeah, yeah， it is.
stark had it made for her.
of course. I should've known.
I will always love you.
then it's a holographic projection activated by certain spectra of light.
Nathan must've programmed it in the diamond.
I didn't know.
it's okay.
I'm in heaven.
Fargo's temperature is...is normal.
it worked.
all right.
um, let's get this working on the swarm.
freezing the bugs in Fargo is one thing, but we can't freeze the whole town.
Oh, we don't need the whole town.
just one really cold tomb.
okay, Zane, plugging it in now.
copy that.
everything in a five-mileradius should hear it.
you don't have much time.
if the bugs start to reproduce, then we'll never get them under control.
way ahead of you.
good luck, sheriff.
here they come.
they're coming.
door!
door!
boombox!
that's part of the plan?
are you crazy?
everybody, hold on!
Vince, freezer!
I'm on it!
that's all of them.
freeze them.
zero degrees， Kelvin, baby.
bless you, fusion reactor!
everyone okay?
a little creeped out, but fine.
Yeah, but my food isn't.
I'm gonna need some grief counseling.
well, better that than being the food.
that's true.
not too shabby, bro.
Yeah, not too shabby yourself.
does this mean that you like my music?
I appreciate it on some level, yeah.
well, I'm glad you guys made up, because if you think I'm cleaning that freezer all on my own, you are sadly mistaken.
welcome back.
how you feeling?
like I just came back from the dead.
it was close.
I saw a bright light and Dr. Stark.
he's okay, Dr. Blake.
you don't have to worry.
he's okay.
I'm sure he is.
they just finished sterilizing the sarcophagus.
good.
an outbreak on tour would create terrible buzz.
so to speak.
I have a new puzzle for you to solve.
a cryptex.
Yeah, I've read about these, but I've never actually seen one.
you think you cancrack it?
you kidding?
I broke into my dad's safe when I was five.
Oh, well, then I picked the right man for the job.
are you sure you want to do this?
well, Nathan left me a message.
I need to hear it.
you want me to stay?
I think I need to do this by myself.
okay.
surprise.
I know what you're thinking.
I can barely handle one Nathan.
what am I gonna do with two?
well, don't worry.
all I've done is imprint a small part of myself onto this diamond.
the way that you have imprinted yourself onto me.
if marriage is about joining two people for eternity,
I wanted to be sure that no matter where you are or where I am,
I will always be with you.
I made mistakes the first time, Ally.
I know that.
but I promise you this time.
this time is forever.
ally. I will always love you.
and I will never, ever leave you again.
good-bye, Nathan.
it's great, you studied hard, and it paid off.
Thanks, dad, but I mean, normal physics in this school
is hard enough.
maybe I don't want to be accelerated.
I just don't want to put myself under too much pressure.
well, pressure can be good for you.
my mother used to say that pressure can make diamonds.
I mean, don't you want to be a diamond?
well, can't I just be, like, a sapphire
who still has time to hang out with her friends?
if you don't have time to take advantage
of opportunities like this,
then maybe... dad, don't even
we should revisit the whole job thing.
okay, you know what, that's fine.
I'll make it work.
yay, physics!
that's the spirit.
Sparky, mind your manners.
sorry, he's not a morning dog.
you are my little muffin cake.
who is the best girl?
Hey, Jo, what's with all the dogs in here?
they're biomimetic.
I don't care what breed they are, it's unsanitary.
it means artificial, Carter.
they're robots.
Oh, that biomimetic. mm-hmm.
Ah, so what, the D.O.D. has some program
to create heavily armed robot dog soldiers?
no, but that would be so cool.
no, this isn't a G. D. thing.
people build them for fun.
they get really competitive about it too.
I just don't want anything too big.
Oh, last time it was you and me at city hall.
it wasn't exactly very memorable.
Yeah, but the wedding night
don't mind us.
that was my plan.
how 'bout this-- I take care of everything,
and you just show up?
Yeah, with my hair done, my makeup.
Oh, my god, I need a dress.
I'll go shopping with you.
it's a wedding gown, not a flak jacket.
I happen to like weddings. You got a problem with that?
okay, I'm not even insulted
that you didn't ask me to cater your reception.
Vincent, would you like to
twist my arm! ow! uncle!
got a possible break-in on feynman road.
um, if you want, I can- I can take it.
Oh, no--hey, I'd love to sit and talk weddings all day,
but, uh, duty calls.
guys, let's talk menu and theme.
I'm picturing elizabethan ball.
whoa, whoa, whoa, doggie.
don't worry, Carter.
robotic dogs don't ruin your pants.
well, it's a scientific advance.
Oh, that's our reigning champion, Fifi.
two years in a row, best in show.
we're going for the triple crown this week.
aren't we, baby?
well, looks like the bitch is back.
Dr. young.
careful, thunder, I wouldn't want you
to catch a programming worm.
is that mange on thunder?
Hey, control your tinker toy!
you stay away from her.
Fifi?
Fifi.
Oh, my god.
Fifi!
Oh, my--fifi!
did fifi make a mess on the grass?
what did you do to her?
nothing.
sheriff, this woman killed my dog!
Dr. deacon,
good to see you back where you belong.
and it is good to be home.
um, i, uh
I've been trying to find a way
to say thank you.
good, because I have a task for you.
good.
this is Dr. Mendel's.
he thinks he knows who did it.
those people are ruining this town.
and who would "those people" be, Dr. Mendel?
those dog lunatics.
they're the ones that broke into my lab.
they'll do anything to win.
was there something here they can use?
what do you make?
synthetic mucus.
Why?
how about to cure every airborne pathogen known to man?
my brew stops them dead.
but those fanatics just want to build
a more realistic dog nose.
all right, well, what makes you think
somebody's been in here?
beakers don't jump off tables by themselves, sheriff.
this could've been a disaster.
I grow my mucus in super-colonies.
if those criminals had spilled
even a small amount of the wrong compounds...
it would've been bad.
okay, um, uh...
well, I'll take a look at your evidence.
Jo, you wanna walk Dr. Mendel inside,
see if anything's missing?
Yeah.
don't touch anything.
Oh, that's bad.
Carter?
Carter?
Oh...what happened?
Mu--mucus happened.
is--is this stuff toxic?
if there was any justice in the world,
it would be.
you're wearing my whole batch of "misty green"!
what did I say about touching things?
I didn't touch anything!
they--they fell in the quake.
